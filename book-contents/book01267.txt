PIPE DREAM 



By fritz leiber 



Simon Grue found a two-inch 
mermaid in his bathtub. It 
had arms, hips, a finny tail, 
and (here the real trouble be- 
gan ) a face that reminded him 
irresistibly of Grushenka Stul- 
nikov-Gurevich , . 



I T WASN’T until the mermaid 
turned up in his bathtub that 
Simon Grue seriously began to won- 
der what the Russians were doing 
on the roof next door. 

The old house next door together 
with its spacious tarpapered roof , 
which held a sort of pent-shack, a 
cylindrical old water tank, and sev- 
eral chicken-wire enclosures, had 
always been a focus of curiosity in 
this region of Greenwich Village, 
especially to whoever happened to 
be renting Simon’s studio, the north 
window-cum-skylight of which 
looked down upon it — if you were 
exceptionally tall or if, like Simon, 
you stood halfway up a stepladder 
and peered. 

During the 1920’s, old-timers told 
Simon, the house had been owned 
by a bootlegger, who had installed 
a costly pipe organ and used the 
water tank to store hooch. Later 
there had been a colony of shaven- 
headed Buddhist monks, who had 
strolled about the roof in their 
orange and yellow robes, meditat- 
ing and eating raw vegetables. 
There had followed a cormnedia 
deir arte theatrical group, a fenc- 
ing salon, a school of the organ 



2 




(the bottlegger’s organ was always 
one of the prime renting points of 
the house), an Arabian restaurant, 
several art schools and silvercraft 
shops of course, and an Existential- 
ist coffee house. 

The last occupants had been two 
bony-cheeked Swedish blondes who 
sunbathed interminably and had 
built the chicken-wire enclosures to 
cage a large number of sinister 
smoke-colored dogs — Simon de- 
cided they were breeding were- 
wolves, and one of his most success- 
ful abstractions, “Gray Hunger”, 
had been painted to the inspiration 
of an eldritch howling. The dogs 
and their owners had depart^ 
abruptly one night in a closed van, 
without any of the dogs ever having 
been offered for sale or either of the 
girls having responded with any- 
thing more than a raised eyebrow to 
Simon’s brave greetings of “Skoal!” 

The Russians had taken posses- 
sion about six months ago — four 
brothers apparently, and one sister, 
who never stirred from the house 
but could occasionally be seen peer- 
ing dreamily from a window. A 
white card with a boldly-inked 
“Stulnikov-Gurevich” had been 
thumbtacked to the peeling green- 
painted front door. Lafcadio Smits, 
the interior decorator, told Simon 
that the newcomers were clearly 
White Russians; he could tell it by 
their bushy beards. Lester Phlegius 
maintained that they were Red 
Russians passing as White, and 
talked alarmingly of spying, sabo- 
tage and suitcase bombs. 

Simon, who had the advantages 
of living on the spot and having 
been introduced to one of the 



brothers — Vasily — at a neighboring 
art gallery, came to believe that they 
were both Red and White and 
something more — solid, complete 
Slavs in any case. Double Dostoev- 
sky Russians if one may be per- 
mitted the expression. They ordered 
vodka, caviar, and soda crackers by 
the case. They argued interminably 
(loudly in Russian, softly in Eng- 
lish) , they went on mysterious silent 
errands, they gloomed about on the 
roof, they made melancholy music 
with their deep harmonious voices 
and several large guitars. Once 
Simon thought they even had the 
bootlegger’s organ going, but there 
had been a bad storm at the time 
and he hadn’t been sure. 

They were not quite as tight- 
lipped as the Swedish girls. Gradu- 
ally a curt front-sidewalk acquaint- 
ance developed and Simon came to 
know their names. There was 
Vasily, of course, who wore thick 
glasses, the most scholarly-looking 
of the lot and certainly the most 
bibulous — Simon came to think of 
Vasily as the Vodka Breather. Oc- 
casionally he could be glimpsed 
holding Erlenmeyer flasks, trays of 
culture dishes, and other pieces of 
biological equipment, or absent- 
mindedly wiping off a glass slide 
with his beard. 

Then there was Ivan, the dourest 
of the four, though none of them 
save Vasily seemed very amiable. 
Simon’s private names for Ivan 
were the Nihilist and the Bomber, 
since he sometimes lugged about 
with him a heavy globular leather 
case. With it and his beard — a 
square black one — he had more 
than once created a mild sensation

FRITZ LEIBER 




in the narrow streets of the Village. 

Next there was Mikhail, who 
wore a large crucifix on a silver 
chain around his neck and looked 
like a more spiritual Rasputin. 
However, Simon thought of him 
less as the Religious than as the 
Whistler — for his inveterate habit 
of whistling into his straggly beard 
a strange tune that obeyed no com- 
mon harmonic laws. Somehow 
Mikhail seemed to carry a chilly 
breeze around with him, a per- 
petual cold draught, so that Simon 
had to check himself in order not 
to clutch together his coat collar 
whenever he heard the approach 
of the eerie piping. 

Finally there was Lev, beardless, 
shorter by several inches, and cer- 
tainly the most elusive of the 
brothers. He always moved at a 
scurry, frequently dipping his head, 
so that it was some time before 
Simon assured himself that he had 
the Stulnikov-Gurevich face. He 
did, unmistakably. Lev seemed to 
be away on trips a good deal. On 
his returns he was frequently ac- 
companied by furtive but impor- 
tant-looking men — a different one 
on each occasion. There would be 
much bustle at such times — among 
other things, the shades would be 
drawn. Then in a few hours Lev 
would be off again, and his man- 
about-town companion too. 

And of course there was the in- 
doors-keeping sister. Several times 
Simon had heard one of the broth- 
ers calling “Grushenka”, so he as- 
sumed that was her name. She had 
the Stulnikov-Gurevich face too, 
though on her, almost incredibly, 
it was strangely attractive. She 

PIPE DREAM 



never ventured on the roof but she 
often sat in the pent-shack. As far 
as Simon could make out, she al- 
ways wore some dark Victorian cos- 
tume — at least it had a high neck, 
long sleeves, and puffed shoulders. 
Pale-faced in the greenish gloom, 
she would stare for hours out of the 
pent-shack’s single window, though 
never in Simon’s direction. Occa- 
sionally she would part and close 
her lips, but not exactly as if she 
were speaking, at least aloud — he 
thought of calling her the Bubble 
Blower. The effect was as odd as 
Mikhail’s whistling but not as un- 
pleasant. In fact, Simon found him- 
self studying Grushenka for ridicu- 
lously long periods of time. His 
mild obsession began to irk him and 
one day he decided henceforth to 
stay away altogether from his north 
window and the stepladder. As a 
result he saw little of the alterations 
the Russians began to make on the 
roof at this point, though he did 
notice that they lugged up among 
other things a length of large- 
diameter transparent plastic piping. 



S O MUCH FOR the Russians, 
now for the mermaid. Late one 
night Simon started to fill his bath- 
tub with cold water to soak his 
brushes and rags — he was working 
with a kind of calcimine at the time, 
experimenting with portable murals 
painted on large plaster-faced 
wooden panels. Heavily laden, he 
got back to the bathroom just in 
time to shut off the water — ^and to 
see a tiny fish of some sort splashing 
around in it. 

He was not unduly surprised. 

5 




Fish up to four or five inches in 
length were not unheard-of appari- 
tions in the cold-water supply of the 
area, and this specimen looked as 
if it displaced no more than a tea- 
spoon of water. 

He made a lucky grab and the 
next moment he was holding in his 
firmly clenched right hand the bot- 
tom half of a slim wriggling crea- 
ture hardly two inches long — and 
now Simon was surprised indeed. 

To begin with, it was not greenish 
white nor any common fish color, 
but palely-pinkish, flesh-colored in 
fact. And it didn’t seem so much a 
fish as a tadpole — at least its visible 
half had a slightly oversize head 
shaped like a bullet that has mush- 
roomed a little, and two tiny writh- 
ing arms or appendages of some sort 
— and it felt as if it had rather large 
hips for a fish or even a tadpole. 
Equip a two-months human embryo 
with a finny tail, give it in addition 
a precocious feminine sexiness, and 
you’d get something of the same 
effect. 

But all that was nothing. The 
trouble was that it had a face — a 
tiny face, of course, and rather 
goggly-ghostly like a planarian’s, 
but a face nevertheless, a human- 
looking face, and also (here was the 
real trouble) a face that bore a 
grotesque but striking resemblance 
to that of Grushenka Stulnikov- 
Gurevich. 

Simon’s fingers tightened convul- 
sively. Simultaneously the slippery 
creature gave a desperate wriggle. 
It shot into the air in a high curve 
and fell into the scant inch of space 
between the bathtub and the wall. 

The next half hour was hectic in 



a groveling sort of way. Retrieving 
anything from behind Simon’s an- 
cient claw-footed bathtub was a 
most difficult feat. There was bare- 
ly space to get an arm under it and 
at one point the warping of the 
floor boards prevented even that. 
Besides, there was the host of dust- 
shrouded objects it had previously 
been too much trouble to tease out 
— an accumulation of decades. At 
first Simon tried to guide himself by 
the faint flopping noises along the 
hidden base of the wall, but these 
soon ceased. 

Being on your knees and your 
chest with an ear against the floor 
and an arm strainingly outstretched 
is probably not the best position to 
assume while weird trains of 
thought go hooting through your 
head, but sometimes it has to hap- 
pen that way. First came a remem- 
bered piece of neighborhood lore 
that supported the possibility of a 
connection between the house next 
door and the tiny pink aquatic crea- 
ture now suffering minute agonies 
behind the bathtub. No one knew 
what ancient and probably larceny- 
minded amateur plumber was 
responsible, but the old-timers as- 
sured Simon there was a link be- 
tween the water supply of the Rus- 
sians’ house with its aerial cistern 
and that of the building containing 
Simon’s studio and several smaller 
apartments; at any rate they main- 
tained that there had been a time 
during the period when the boot- 
legger was storing hooch in the 
water tank that several neighbor- 
hood cold-water taps were dispens- 
ing a weak but nonetheless authori- 
tative mixture of bourbon and 



6 



FRITZ LEIBER 




branch water. 

So, thought Simon as he groped 
and strained, if the Russians were 
somehow responsible for this weird 
fishlet, there was no insuperable 
difficulty in understanding how it 
might have gotten here. 

But that was the least of Simon’s 
preoccupations. He scrabbled wildly 
and unsuccessfully for several min- 
utes, then realizing he would never 
get anywhere in this unsystematic 
manner, he began to remove the 
accumulated debris piece by piece: 
dark cracked ends of soap, wash- 
rags dried out in tortured attitudes, 
innumerable dark-dyed cigarette 
stumps, several pocket magazines 
with bleached wrinkled pages, 
empty and near-empty medicine 
bottles and pill vials, rusty hairpins, 
bobby pins, safety pins, crumpled 
toothpaste tubes (and a couple for 
oil paint), a gray toothbrush, a 
§fty-cent piece and several pennies, 
the mummy of a mouse, a letter 
from Picasso, and last of all, from 
the dark comer behind the bath- 
tub’s inside claw, the limp pitiful 
thing he was seeking. 

It was even tinier than he’d 
thought. He carefully washed the 
dust and flug off it, but it was clear- 
ly dead and its resemblance to 
Grushenka Stulnikov-Gurevich had 
become problematical — indeed, Si- 
mon decided that someone seeing 
it now for the first time would think 
it a freak minnow or monstrous 
tadpole and nothing more, though 
mutation or disease had obviously 
been at work. The illusion of a 
miniature mermaid still existed in 
the tapering tail and armlike ap- 
pendages, but it was faint. He tried 

PIPE DREAM 



to remember what he knew about 
salamanders — almost nothing, it 
turned out. He thought of embryos, 
but his mind veered away from the 
subject. 

He wandered back into the studio 
carrying the thing in his hand. He 
climbed the stepladder by the north 
window and studied the house next 
door. What windows he could see 
were dark. He got a very vague 
impression that the roof had 
changed. After he had strained his 
eyes for some time he fancied he 
could see a faint path of greenish 
luminescence streaming between the 
pent-shack and the water-tank, but 
it was very faint indeed and might 
only be his vision swimming. 

He climbed down the stepladder 
and stood for a moment weighing 
the tiny dead thing in his hand. It 
occurred to him that one of his 
friends at the university could dig 
up a zoologist to pass on his find. 

But Simon’s curiosity was more 
artistic than scientific. In the end 
he twisted a bit of cellophane 
around the thing, placed it on the 
ledge of his easel and went off to 
bed . and to a series of disturb- 
ingly erotic dreams. 



N ext day he got up late and, 
after breakfasting on black cof- 
fee, gloomed around the studio for 
a while, picking things up and put- 
ting them down. He glanced fre- 
quently at the stepladder, but re- 
sisted the temptation to climb up 
and have another look next door. 
Sighing, he thumbtacked a sheet of 
paper to a drawing board and half- 
heartedly began blocking in a fe- 



7 




male figure. It was insipid and life- 
less. Stabbing irritably at the heavy 
cui’ve of the figure’s hip, he broke 
his charcoal. “Damn!” he said, glar- 
ing around the room. Abandoning 
all pretense, he threw the charcoal 
on the floor and climbed the step- 
ladder. He pressed his nose against 
the glass. 

In daylight, the adjoining roof 
looked bare and grimy. There was a 
big transparent pipe running be- 
tween the water tank and the shack, 
braced in two places by improvised- 
looking wooden scaffolding. Listen- 
ing intently, Simon thought he 
could hear a motor going in the 
shack. The water looked sallow 
green. It reminded Simon of those 
futuristic algae farms where the 
stuff is supposed to be pumped 
through transparent pipes to expose 
it to sunlight. There seemed to be 
a transparent top on the water tank 
too — it was too high for Simon to 
see, but there was a gleam around 
the edge. Staring at the pipe again, 
Simon got the impression there were 
little things traveling in the water, 
but he couldn’t make them out. 

Climbing down in some excite- 
ment, Simon got the twist of cello- 
phane from the ledge of the easel 
and stared at its contents. Wild 
thoughts were tumbling through his 
head as he got back up on the step- 
ladder. Sunlight flashed on the 
greenish water pipe between the 
tank and the shack, but after the 
first glance he had no eyes for it. 
Grushenka Stulnikov-Gurevich had 
her face tragically pressed to the 
window of the shack. She was wear- 
ing the black drcss with high neck 
and puffed shoulders. At that mo- 

8 



ment she looked straight at him. 
She lifted her hands and seemed to 
speak imploringly. Then she slowly 
sank from sight as if, it horridly 
occurred to Simon, into quicksand. 

Simon sprang from his chair, 
heart beating wildly, and ran down 
the stairs to the street. Two or three 
passersby paused to study him as he 
alternately pounded the flaking 
green door of the Russians' house 
and leaned on the button. Also 
watching was the shirt-sleeved 
driver of a moving van, emblazoned 
“Stulnikov-Gurevicli Enterprises,” 
which almost filled the street in 
front of the house. 

The door opened narrowly. A 
man with a square black beard 
frowned out of it. He topped Simon 
by almost a head. 

“Yes?” Ivan the Bomber asked, 
in a deep, exasperated voice. 

“I must see the lady of the house 
immediately,” Simon cried. “Your 
sister, I believe. She’s in danger.” 
He surged forward. 

The butt of the Bomber’s right 
palm took him firmly in the chest 
and he staggered back. The Bomber 
said coldly, “My sister is — hal — 
taking a bath.” 

Simon cried, “In that case she’s 
drowning!” and surged forward 
again, but the Bomber’s hand 
stopped him short. “I’ll call the 
police!” Simon shouted, flailing his 
limbs. The hand at his chest sud- 
denly stopped pushing and began 
to pull. Gripped by the front of his 
shirt, Simon felt himself being 
drawn rapidly inside. “Let go! 
Help, a kidnapping!” he shouted to 
the inquisitive faces outside, before 
the door banged shut. 



FRITZ LEIBER 




“No police!” rumbled the Bomb- 
er, assisting Simon upstairs. 

“Now look here,” Simon pro- 
tested futilely. In the two-story-high 
living room to his right, the pipes 
of an organ gleamed golden from 
the shadows. At the second landing, 
a disheveled figure met them, 
glasses twinkling — Vasily the Vodka 
Breather. He spoke querulously in 
Russian to Ivan, who replied short- 
ly, then Vasily turned and the three 
of them crowded up the narrow 
third flight to the pent-shack. This 
housed a small noisy machine, per- 
haps an aerator of some sort, for 
bubbles were streaming into the 
transparent pipe where it was con- 
nected to the machine; and under 
the pipe, sitting with an idiot smile 
on a chair of red plush and gilt, was 
a pale black-mustached man. An 
empty clear-glass bottle with a red 
and gold label lay on the floor at 
his feet. The opposite side of the 
room was hidden by a heavy plastic 
shower curtain. Grushenka Stul- 
nikov-Gurevich was not in view. 

Ivan said something explosive, 
picking up the bottle and staring at 
it. “Vodka!” he went on. “I have 
told you not to mix the pipe and 
the vodka! Now see what you have 
done!” 

“To me it seemed hospitable,” 
said Vasily with an apologetic ges- 
ture. “Besides, only one bottle — ” 

Ducking under the pipe where it 
crossed the pent-shack, Ivan picked 
up the pale man and dumped him 
crosswise in the chair, with his 
patent-leather shoes sticking up on 
one side and his plump hands 
crossed over his chest. “Let him 
sleep. First we must take down all 

PIPE DREAM 



the apparatus, before the capital- 
istic police arrive. Now : what to do 
with this one?” He looked at Simon, 
and clenched one large and hairy 
fist. 

'^Nyet-nyet-nyet/^ said the Vodka 
Breather, and went to whisper in 
Ivan’s ear. They both stared at 
Simon, who felt uncomfortable and 
began to back toward the door; but 
Ivan ducked agilely under the pipe 
and grasped him by the arm, pull- 
ing him eflfortlessly toward the roof 
exit. “Just come this way if you 
please, Mr. Gru-ay/"' said Vasily, 
hurrying after. As they left the 
shack, he picked up a kitchen chair. 

Crossing the roof, Simon made 
a sudden effort and wrenched him- 
self free. They caught him again 
at the edge of the roof, where he 
had run with nothing clearly in 
mind, but with his mouth open to 
yell. Suspended in the grip of the 
two Russians, with Ivan’s meaty 
palm over his mouth, Simon had a 
momentary glimpse of the street 
below. A third bearded figure, 
Mikhail the Religious, was staring 
up at them from the sunny side- 
walk. The melancholy face, the 
deep-socketed tormented eyes, and 
the narrow beard tangled with the 
dangling crucifix combined to give 
the effect of a Tolstoy novel’s dust- 
jacket. As they hauled Simon away, 
he had the impression that a chilly 
breeze had sprung up and the street 
had darkened. In his ears was Mik- 
hail’s distant, oddly discordant 
whistling. 

Grunting, the two brothers set 
Simon down on the kitchen chair 
and slid him across the roof until 
something hard but resilient 



9 




touched the top of his head. It was 
the plastic pipe, through which, 
peering upward, he could see myri- 
ads of tiny polliwog-shapes flitting 
back and forth. 

“Do us a kindness not to make 
noise,” said Ivan, removing his 
palm. “My brother Vasily will now 
explain.” He went away. 

C URIOSITY as much as shock 
kept Simon in his chair. Vasily, 
bobbing his head and smiling, sat 
down tailor-fashion on the roof in 
front of him. “First I must tell you, 
Mr. Gru-ay^ that I am specialist in 
biological sciences. Here you see re- 
sults of my most successful experi- 
ment.” He withdrew a round clear- 
glass bottle from his pocket and 
unscrewed the top. 

“Ah?” said Simon tentatively. 
“Indeed yes. In my researches, 
Mi . Gru-^/y, 1 discovered a chemi- 
cal \\ Inch will inhibit growth at any 
level of embryonic development, 
producing a viable organism at that 
point. The basic effect of this 
chemical is always toward sui'vival 
at whatever level of development — 
one cell, a blastula, a worm, a fish, 
a four-legger. This research, which 
Lysenko scoffed at when I told him 
of it, I had no trouble in keeping 
secret, though at the time I was 
working as the unhappy collabora- 
tor of the godless soviets. But per- 
haps I am being too technical?” 
“Not at all,” Simon assured him. 
“Good,” Vasily said with simple 
satisfaction and gulped at his bot- 
tle. “Meanwhile my brother Mik- 
hail was a religious brother at a 
monastery near Mount Athos, my 

10 



Nihilist brother Ivan was in cen- 
tral Europe, while my third brother 
Lev, who is of commercial talents, 
had preceded us to the New World, 
where we always felt it would some 
day be our destiny to join one an- 
other. 

“With the aid of brother Ivan, I 
and my sister Grushenka escaped 
from Russia. We picked up Mikhail 
from his monastery and proceeded 
here, where Lev had become a 
capitalist business magnate. 

“My brothel's, Ivan especially, 
were interested in my research. He 
had a theory that we could even- 
tually produce hosts of men in this 
way, whole armies and political 
parties, all Nihilist and all of them 
Stulnikov-Gurcviches. I assured 
him that this was impossible, that I 
could not play Cadmus, for free- 
swimming forms are one thing, we 
have the way to feed them in the 
aqueous medium ; but to make 
fully developed mammals placental 
nourishment is necessary — that I 
cannot provide. Yet to please him 
I begin with (pardon me!) tlie egg 
of my sister, that was as good a be- 
ginning as any and perhaps it in- 
trigued my vanity. Ivan dreamed 
his dreams of a Nihilist Stulnikov- 
Gurevich humanity — it was harm- 
less, as I told myself.” 

Simon stared at him glassy-eyed. 
Something rather peculiar was be- 
ginning to happen inside hi^ head — 
about an inch under the point 
where the cool water-filled plastic 
pipe pressed down on his scalp. 
Little ghostly images were darting 
—delightfully wispy litde girl- 
things, smiling down at him im- 
pudently, then flirting away with a 

FRITZ LEIKR 




quick motion of their mermaid 
tails. 

The sky had been growing stead- 
ily darker and now there came the 
growl of thunder. Against the pur- 
ple-gray clouds Simon could barely 
make out the semi-transparent 
shapes of the golliwogs in the pipe 
over his head; but the images in- 
side his mind were growing clearer 
by the minute. 

“Ah, we have a storm,” Vasily 
observed as the thunder growled 
again. “That reminds me of Mik- 
hail, who is much influenced by 
our Finnish grandmother. He had 
the belief as a child that he could 
call up the winds by whistling for 
them — he even learned special 
wind musics from her. Later he be- 
came a Christian religious — there 
are great struggles in him. Mikhail 
objected to my researches when he 
heard I used the egg of my sister. 
He said we will produce millions 
of souls who are not baptized. I 
asked him how about the water 
they are in, he replied this is not 
the same thing, these little swim- 
mers will wriggle in hell eternally. 
This worried him greatly. We tried 
to tell him I had not used the egg 
of my sister, only the egg of a fish. 

“But he did not believe this, be- 
cause my sister changed greatly at 
the time. She no longer spoke. She 
put on my mother’s bathing cos- 
tume (we are a family people) and 
retired to the bathtub all day long. 
I accepted this — at least in the wa- 
ter she is not violent. Mikhail said, 
‘See, her soul is now split into many 
unredeemed sub-souls, one each for 
the little swimmers. There is a 
sympathy between them — a hyp- 

PIPE DREAM 



node vibration. So long as you keep 
them near her, in that tank on the 
roof, this will be. If they were gone 
from there, far from there, the sub- 
souls would reunite and Grushen- 
ka’s soul would be one again.’ He 
begged me to stop my research, to 
dump it in the sea, to scatter it 
away, but Lev and Ivan demand 
I keep on. Yet Mikhail warned me 
that works of evil end in the whirl- 
wind. I am torn and undecided.” 
He gulped at his vodka. 

Thunder growled louder. Simon 
was thinking, dreamily, that if the 
soul of Grushenka Stulnikov-Gu- 
revich were split into thousands of 
sub-souls, vibrating hynotically in 
the nearby water tank, with at least 
one of them escaping as far as his 
bathtub, then it was no wonder if 
Grushenka had a strange attrac- 
tion for him. 

“But that is not yet the worst,” 
Vasily continued. “The hypnotic 
vibrations of the free-swimming 
ones in their multitude turn out to 
have a stimulating effect on any 
male who is near. Their sub-minds 
induce dreams of the piquant sort. 
Lev says that to make money for 
the work we must sell these dreams 
to rich men. I protest, but to no 
avail. 

“Lev is maddened for money. 
Now besides selling the dreams I 
find he plans to sell the creatures 
themselves, sell them one by one, 
but keep enough to sell the dreams 
too. It is a madness.” 

The darkness had become that of 
night. The thunder continued to 
growl and now it seemed to Simon 
that it had music in it. Visions 
swam through his mind to its 

11 




rhythm — hordes of swimming pyg- 
my souls, of unborn water babies, 
migrations of miniature mermaids. 
The pipe hanging between water 
tank and pentshack became in his 
imagination a giant umbilicus or a 
canal for a monstrous multiple 
birth. Sitting beneath it, helpless to 
move, he focused his attention with 
increasing pleasure on the active, 
supple, ever more human girl- 
bodies that swam across his mind. 
Now more mermaid than tadpole, 
with bright smiling lips and eyes, 
long Lorelei-hair trailing behind 
them, they darted and hovered 
caressingly. In their wide-cheeked 
oval faces, he discovered without 
shock, there was a transcendent re- 
semblance to the features of 
Grushenka Stulnikov-Gurevich — a 
younger, milk-skinned maiden of 
the steppes, with challenging eyes 
and fingers that brushed against 
him with delightful shocks. 

“So it is for me the great prob- 
lem,” Vasily’s distant voice con- 
tinued. “I see in my work only the 
pure research, the play of the mind. 
Lev sees money, Ivan sees dragon 
teeth — fodder for his political can- 
non — Mikhail sees unshriven souls, 
Grushenka sees — who knows? — 
madness. It is indeed one great 
problem.” 

T hunder game again, 

crashingly this time. The door 
of the pent-shack opened. Framed 
in it stood Ivan the Bomber. “Vas- 
ily!” he roared. “Do you know 
what that idiot is doing now?” 

As the thunder and his voice 
trailed off together, Simon became 

12 



aware at last of the identity of the 
other sound, which had been grow- 
ing in volume all the time. 

Simultaneously Vasily struggled 
to his feet. 

“The organ!” he cried. “Mikhail 
is playing the Whirlwind Music! 
We must stop him!” Pausing only 
for a last pull at the bottle, he 
charged into the pent-shack, follow- 
ing Ivan. 

Wind was shaking the heavy pipe 
over Simon’s head, tossing him 
back and forth in the chair. Look- 
ing with an effort toward the west, 
Simon saw the reason: a spinning 
black pencil of wind that was writ- 
ing its way toward them in wreck- 
age across the intervening roofs. 

The chair fell under him. Stum- 
bling across the roof, he tugged 
futilely at the door to the pent- 
shack, then threw himself flat, 
clawing at the tarpaper. 

There was a mounting roar. The 
top of the water tank went spin- 
ning off like a flying saucer. Mo- 
mentarily, as if it were a giant 
syringe, the whirlwind dipped into 
the tank. Simon felt himself slid- 
ing across the roof, felt his legs lift- 
ing. He fetched up against the 
roofs low wall and at that moment 
the wind let go of him and his legs 
touched tarpaper again. 

Gaining his feet numbly, Simon 
staggered into the leaning pent- 
shack. The pale man was nowhere 
to be seen, the plush chair empty. 
The curtain at the other side of the 
room had fallen with its rods, re- 
vealing a bathtub more antique 
than Simon’s. In the tub, under 
the window, sat Grushenka. The 
lightning flares showed her with 

FRITZ LEIBER 




her chin level with the water, her 
eyes placidly staring, her mouth 
opening and closing. 

Simon found himself putting his 
arms around the black-clad figure. 
With a straining effort he lifted her 
out of the tub, water sloshing all 
over his legs, and half carried, half 
slid with her down the stairs. 

He fetched up panting and di- 
sheveled at the top landing, his at- 
tention riveted by the lightning- 
illuminated scene in the two-story- 
high living room below. At the far 
end of it a dark-robed figure 
crouched at the console of the 
mighty organ, like a giant bat at 
the base of the portico of a black 
and gold temple. In the center of 
the room Ivan was in the act of 
heaving above his head his globu- 
lar leather case. 

Mikhail darted a look over his 
shoulder and sprang to one side. 
The projectile crashed against the 
organ. Mikhail picked himself up, 
tearing something from his neck. 
Ivan lunged forward with a roar. 
Mikhail crashed a fist against his 
jaw. The Bomber went down and 
didn’t come up. Mikhail un- 
wrapped his crucifix from his fin- 
gers and resumed playing. 

With a wild cry Simon heaved 
himself to his feet, stumbled over 
Grushenka’s sodden garments, and 
pitched headlong down the stairs. 

When he came to, the house was 
empty and the Stulnikov moving 
van was gone. At the front door he 
was met by a poker-faced young 
man who identified himself as a 
member of the FBI. Simon showed 
him the globular case Ivan had 
thrown at the organ. It proved to 

PIPE DREAM 



contain a bowling ball. 

The young gendeman listened 
to his story without changing ex- 
pression, thanked him warmly, and 
shooed him out. 

The Stulnikov-Gureviches dis- 
appeared for good, though not 
quite without a trace. Simon found 
this item in the next evening’s pa- 
per, the first of many he accumu- 
lated yearningly in a scrapbook 
during the following months: 

MERMAID RAIN A HOAX, 
SCIENTIST DECLARES 

Milford^ Pa . — The “mermaid 
rain” reported here has been de- 
clared a fraud by an eminent Euro- 
pean biologist. Vasily Stulnikov- 
Gurevich, formerly Professor of 
Gene ties at Pire University, Latvia, 
passing through here on a cross- 
country trip, declared the minia- 
ture “mermaids” were “albino tad- 
poles, probably scattered about as 
a hoax by schoolboys.” 

The professor added, “I would 
like to know where they got them, 
however. There is clear evidence of 
mutation, due perhaps to fallout.” 

Dr. Stulnikov directed his party 
in a brief but intensive search for 
overlooked specimens. His charm- 
ing silent sister, Grushenka Stulni- 
kov, wearing a quaint Latvian 
swimming costume, explored the 
shallows of the Delaware. 

After collecting as many speci- 
mens as possible, the professor and 
his assistants continued their trip 
in their unusual camping car. Dr. 
Stulnikov intends to found a bio- 
logical research center “in the calm 
and tolerant atmosphere of the 
West Coast,” he declared. END

Inhabited only by whispering winds y Robins World was a 
paradise for the wrong two people — Eve and her son . 



I T HAD been a long layover for 
the Starholm's crew, hunting 
heavy elements for fuel — eight 
months, on an idyllic green para- 
dise of a planet; a soft, windy, 
whispering world, inhabited only by 
trees and winds. But in the end it 
presented its own unique problem. 

Specifically, it presented Captain 
Merrihew with the problem of 
Robin, male, father unknown, who 
had been born the day before, and 
a month prematurely, to Dr. Helen 
Murray. 

Merrihew found her lying abed 
in the laboratory shelter, pale and 
calm, with the child beside her. 

The little shelter, constructed 
roughly of green planks, looked out 
on the clearing which the Star holm 
had used as a base of operations 
during the layover; a beautiful 
place at the bottom of a wide val- 
ley, in the curve of a broad, deep- 
flowing river. The crew, tired of 
being shipbound, had built half a 
dozen such huts and shacks in these 
eight months. 

Menihew glared down at Helen. 
He snorted, ‘This is a fine situa- 
tion. You, of all the people in the 
whole damned crew — the ship’s 
doctor! It’s — it’s — ” Inarticulate 
with rage, he fell back on a ridicu- 
lously inadequate phrase. “It’s — 
criminal carelessness!” 



“I know.” Helen Murray, too 
young and far too lovely for a ship’s 
officer on a ten-year cruise, still 
looked weak and white, and her 
voice was a gentle shadow of its 
crisp self. “I’m afraid four years in 
space made me careless.” 

Merrihew brooded, looking down 
at her. Something about ship-grav- 
ity conditions, while not affecting 
potency, made conception impos- 
sible; no child had ever been con- 
ceived in space and none ever 
would. On planet layovers, the ef- 
fect wore off very slowly; only after 
three months aground had Dr. 
Murray started routine administra- 
tion of anticeptin to the twenty-two 
women of the crew, herself in- 
cluded. At that time she had been 
still unaware that she herself was 
already carrying a child. 

Outside, the leafy forest whis- 
pered and rustled, and Merrihew 
knew Helen had forgotten his ex- 
istence again. The day-old child 
was tucked up in one of her rolled 
coveralls at her side. To Merrihew, 
he looked like a skinned monkey, 
but Helen’s eyes smoldered as her 
hands moved gendy over the tiny 
round head. 

He stood and listened to the 
winds and said at random, “These 
shacks will fall to pieces in another 
month. It doesn’t matter, we’ll have 

15 




taken off by then.” 

Dr. Chao Lin came into the 
shack, an angular woman of thirty- 
five. She said, “Company, Helen? 
Well, it’s about time. Here, let me 
take Robin.” 

Helen said in weak protest, 
“You’re spoiling me, Lin.” 

“It will do you good,” Chao Lin 
returned. Merrihew, in a sudden 
surge of fury and frustration, ex- 
ploded, “Damn it, Lin, you’re mak- 
ing it all worse. He’ll die when we 
go into overdrive, you know as well 
as I do!” 

Helen sat up, clutching Robin 
protectively. “Are you proposing to 
drown him like a kitten?” 

“Helen, I’m not proposing any- 
thing. I’m stating a fact.” 

“But it’s not a fact. He won’t die 
in overdrive because he won’t be 
aboard when we go into over- 
drive!” 

Merrihew looked at Lin help- 
lessly, but his face softened. “Shdl 
we — put him to sleep and bury him 
here?” 

The woman’s face turned white. 
“No!” she cried in passionate pro- 
test, and Lin bent to disengage her 
frantic grip. “Helen, you’ll hurt 
him. Put him down. There.” 

Merrihew looked down at her, 
troubled, and said, “We can’t just 
abandon him to die slowly, 
Helen — ” 

“Who says I’m going to abandon 
him?” 

Merrihew asked slowly, “Are 
you planning to desert?” He added, 
after a minute, “There’s a chance 
lie’ll survive. After all, his v^ry 
birth was against all medical prece- 
dent. Maybe — ” 

16 



“Captain — ” Helen sounded des- 
perate. “Even drugged, no child 
under ten has ever endured the 
shift into hyperspace drive. A new- 
born would die in seconds.” She 
clasped Robin to her again, and 
said, “It’s the only way — you have 
Lin for a doctor, Reynolds can 
handle my collateral duties. This 
planet is uninhabited, the climate 
is mild, we couldn’t possibly 
starve.” Her face, so gentle, was 
suddenly like rock. “Enter my 
death in the log, if you want to.” 

Merrihew looked from Helen to 
Lin, and said, “Helen, you’re in- 
sane!” 

She said, “Even if I’m sane now, 
I wouldn’t be long if I had to aban- 
don Robin.” The wild note had 
died out of her voice, and she spoke 
rationally, but inflexibly. “Captain 
Merrihew, to get me aboard the 
Starholm, you will have to have me 
drugged or taken by force; I prom- 
ise you I won’t go any other way. 
And if you do that — and if Robin 
is left behind, or dies in overdrive — 
just so you will have my services 
as a doctor — then I solemnly swear 
that I will kill myself at the first 
opportunity.” 

“My God,” said Merrihew, “you 
are insane!” 

Helen gave a very tiny shrug. 
“Do you want a madwoman 
aboard?” 

Chao Lin said quietly, “Captain, 
I don’t see any other way. We 
would have had to arrange it that 
way if Helen had actually died in 
childbirth. Of two unsatisfactory 
solutions, we must choose the least 
harmful.” And Merrihew knew 
that he had no real choice. 

MARION ZIMMER BRADLEY 




“I still think you’re both crazy,” 
he blustered, but it was surrender, 
and Helen knew it. 

Ten days after the Starholm took 
off, young Colin Reynolds, tech- 
nician, committed suicide by the 
messy procedure of slicing his jugu- 
lar artery, which — in zero gravity — 
distributed several quarts of blood 
in big round globules all over his 
cabin. He left an incoherent note. 

Merrihew put the note in the 
disposal and Chao Lin put the 
blood in the ship’s blood-bank for 
surgery, and they hushed it up as 
an accident; but Merrihew had the 
unpleasant feeling that the layover 
on the green and windy planet was 
going to become a legend, spread in 
whispers by the crew. And it did, 
but that is another story. 



OBIN WAS two years old 
when he first heard the voices 
in the wind. He pulled at his moth- 
er’s arm and crooned softly, in imi- 
tation. 

“What is it, lovey?” 

“Pretty.” He crooned again to 
the distant murmuring sound. 

Helen smiled vaguely and patted 
the round cheek. Robin, his infant 
imagination suddenly distracted, 
said, “Hungry. Robin hungry. Ber- 
ries.” 

“Berries after you eat,” Helen 
promised absently, and picked him 
up. Robin tugged at her arm. 

“Mommy pretty, too!” 

She laughed, a rosy and smiling 
young Diana. She was happy on the 
solitary planet ; they lived quite 
comfortably in one of the larger 
shacks, and only a little frown-line 

THE WIND PEOPLE 



between her eyes bore witness to 
the terror which had closed down 
on her in the first months, when 
every new day had been some new 
struggle — against weakness, against 
unfamiliar sounds, against loneli- 
ness and dread. Nights when she 
lay wakeful, sweating with terror 
while the winds rose and fell again 
and her imagination gave them 
voices, bleak days when she wan- 
dered dazedly around the shack or 
stared moodily at Robin. There had 
been moments — only fleeting, and 
penanced with hours of shame and 
regret — when she thought that 
even the horror of losing Robin in 
those first days would have been 
less than the horror of spending the 
rest of her life alone here; when 
she had wondered why Merrihew 
had not realized that she was un- 
balanced, and forced her to go 
with them ... by now, Robin 
would have been only a moment’s 
painful memory. 

Still not strong, knowing she had 
to be strong for Robin or he would 
die as surely as if she had aban- 
doned him, she had spent the first 
months in a somnambulistic dream. 
Sometimes she had walked for days 
at a time in that dream; she would 
wake to find food that she could 
not remember gathering. Some- 
how, pervasive, the dream-voices 
had taken over; the whispering 
winds had been full of voices and 
even hands. 

She had fallen ill and lain for 
days sick and delirious, and had 
heard a voice which hardly seemed 
to be her own, saying that if she 
died the wind voices would care 
for Robin . and then the shock 




17 




and irrationality of that had star- 
tled her out of delirium, agonized 
and trembling, and she pulled her- 
self upright and cried out “No!” 

And the shimmer of eyes and 
voices had faded again into vague 
echoes, until there was only the 
stir of sunlight on the leaves, and 
Robin, chubby and naked, kicking 
in the sunlight, cooing with his 
hands outstretched to the rustle of 
leaves and shadows. 

She had known, then, that she 
had to get well. She had never 
heard the wind voices again, and 
her crisp, scientific mind rejected 
the fanciful theory that if she only 
believed in the wind voices she 
would see their forms and hear 
their words clearly. And she re- 
jected them so thoroughly that 
when she heard them speak she 
shut them away from her mind, 
and alter a time heard tlieni no 
longer, except in restless dreams. 

By now she had accepted the 
isolation and the beauty of their 
world, and begun to make a happy 
life for Robin. 

For lack of other occupation last 
summer — though the winter was 
mild and there was no lack of 
fruits and roots even then — Helen 
had patiently snared male and fe- 
male of small animals like rabbits, 
and now she had a pen of them. 
They provided a change of diet, 
and after a few smelly unsuccessful 
experiments she had devised a way 
to supple their fur pelts. She made 
no effort at gardening, though 
when Robin was older she might 
try that. For the moment, it was 
enough that they were healthy and 
safe and protected. 



. Robin was listening again. 
Helen bent her ear, sharpened by 
the silence, but heard only the 
rustle of wind and leaves; saw only 
falling brightness along a silvered 
tree-trunk. 

Wind? When there were no 
branches stirring? 

“Ridiculous,” she said sharply, 
then snatched up the baby boy and 
squeezed him before hoisting him 
astride her hip. “Mommy doesn’t 
mean you, Robin. Lets look for 
berries.” 

But soon she realized that his 
head was tipped back and that he 
was listening, again, to some sound 
she could not hear. 



O N WHAT she said was Robin’s 
fifth birthday, Helen had 
made a special bed for him in an- 
other room of the building. He 
missed the warmth of Helen’s body, 
and the comforting sound of her 
breathing; for Robin, since birth, 
had been a wakeful child. 

Yet, on the first night alone. 
Robin felt curiously freed. He did 
something he had never dared do 
before, for fear of waking Helen; 
he slipped from his bed and stood 
in the doorway, looking into the 
forest. 

The forest was closer to the door- 
way now; Robin could fuzzily re- 
member when the clearing had 
been wider. Now, slowly, beyond 
the garden , patcli which Helen kept 
cleared, the underbrush and sap- 
lings were growing back, and even 
what Robin called “the bunted 
place” was covered with new sparse 
grass. 



18 



MARION ZIMMER BRADLEY 




Robin was accustomed to being 
alone, during the day — even in his 
first year, Helen had had to leave 
him alone, securely fastened in the 
house, or inside a little tight-fenced 
yard. But he was not used to being 
alone at night. 

Far off in the forest, he could 
hear the whispers of the other peo- 
ple. Helen said there were no other 
people, but Robin knew better, be- 
cause he could hear their voices on 
the wind, like fragments of the 
songs Helen sang at bedtime. And 
sometimes he could almost see them 
in the shadowy spots. 

Once when Helen had been sick, 
a long time ago, and Robin had run 
helplessly from the fenced yard to 
the inside room and back again, 
hungry and dirty and furious be- 
cause Helen only slept on the bed 
with\her eyes closed, rousing up 
now and then to whimper like he 
did when he fell down and skinned 
his knee, the winds and voices had 
come into the very house; Robin 
had hazy memories of soothing 
voices, of hands that touched him 
more softly than Helen’s hands. 
But he could not quite remember. 

Now that he could hear them so 
clearly, he would go and find the 
other people. And then if Helen 
was sick again, there would be 
someone else to play with him and 
look after him. He thought glee- 
fully, wonH Helen be surprised, and 
darted off across the clearing. 

Helen woke, roused not by a 
sound but by a silence. She no 
longer heard Robin’s soft breaths 
from the alcove, and after a mo- 
ment she realized something else: 

THE WIND PEOPLE 



The winds were silent. 

Perhaps, she thought, a storm 
was coming. Some change in air 
pressure could cause this stillness — 
but Robin? She tiptoed to the al- 
cove; as she had suspected, his bed 
was empty. 

Where could he be? In the clear- 
ing? With a storm coming? She 
slid her feet into hand-made san- 
dals and ran outside, her quivering 
call ringing out through the silent 
forest : 

“Robin— oh, Robin!” 

Silence. And far away a little 
ominous whisper. And for the first 
time, since that first frightening 
year of loneliness, she felt lost, de- 
serted in an alien world. She ran 
across the clearing, looking around 
wildly, trying to decide which way 
he could have wandered. Into the 
forest? What if he had strayed to- 
ward the river bank? There was a 
place where the bank crumbled 
away, down toward the rapids — 
her throat closed convulsively, and 
her call was almost a shriek: 

“Oh, Robin! Robin, darling! 
Robin!” 

She ran through the paths worn 
by their feet, hearing snatches of 
rustle, winds and leaves suddenly 
vocal in the cold moonlight around 
her. It was the first time since the 
spaceship left them that Helen had 
ventured out into the night of their 
world. She called again, her voice 
cracking in panic. 

“Ro-bin!” 

A sudden stray gleam revealed a 
glint of white, and a child stood 
in the middle of the path. Helen 
gasped with relief and ran to snatch 
up her son — then fell back in dis- 



19 




may. It was not Robin who stood 
there. The child was naked, about 
a head shorter than Robin, and 
female. 

There was something curious 
about the bare and gleaming flesh, 
as if she could see the child only in 
the full flush of the moonlight. A 
round, almost expressionless face 
was surrounded by a mass of color- 
less streaming hair, the exact color 
of the moonlight. Helen’s audible 
gasp startled her to a stop : she 
shut her eyes convulsively, and 
when she opened them the path 
was black and empty and Robin 
was running down the track to- 
ward her. 

Helen caught him up, with a 
strangled cry, and ran, clasping 
him to her breast, back down the 
path to their shack. Inside, she 
barred ' the door and laid Robin 
down in her own bed, and threw 
herself down shivering, too shaken 
to speak, too sliaken to scold him, 
curiously afraid to question. I had 
a hallucination, she told herself, a 
hallucination, another dream, a 
dream. 

A dream, like the other Dream. 
She dignified it to herself as The 
Dream, because it was not like any 
other dream she had ever had. She 
had dreamed it first before Robin’s 
birth, and been ashamed to speak 
of it to Chao Lin, fearing the com- 
mon-sense skepticism of the older 
woman. 

On their tenth night on the green 
planet (the Star holm was a dim 
recollection now) when Merri- 
hew’s scientists had been convinced 
that the little world was safe, with- 

20 



out wild beasts or diseases or sav- 
age natives, the crew had requested 
permission to camp in the valley 
clearing beside the river. Permis- 
sion granted, they had gone apart 
in couples almost as usual, and 
even those who had no enduring 
liaison at the moment had found 
a partner for the night. 

It must have been that night, . 

Colin Reynolds was two years 
younger than Helen, and their at- 
tachment, enduring over a few 
months of shiptime, was based less 
on mutual passion than a sort of 
boyish need in him, a sort of im- 
personal feminine solicitude in 
Helen. All her affairs had been like 
that, companionable, comfortable, 
but never passionate. Curiously 
enough, Helen was a woman capa- 
ble of passion, of great depths of 
devotion ; but no man had ever 
roused it and now no man ever 
would. Only Robin’s birth had 
touched her deeply-pent emotions. 

But that night, when Colin 
Reynolds was sleeping, Helen 
stayed restlessly awake, hearing the 
unquiet stirring of wind on the 
leaves. After a time slic wandered 
down to the water’s edge, staying a 
cautious distance from the shore — 
for the cliff crumbled dangerously 
— and stretched herself out to listen 
to the wind- voices. And after a 
time she fell asleep, and had The 
Dream, which was to return to her 
again and again. 

Helen thought of herself as a 
scientist, without room for fan- 
tasies, and that was why she called 
it, fiercely, a dream; a dream born 
of some undiagnosed conflict in her. 
Even to herself Helen would not 



MARION ZIMMER BRADLEY 




recall it in full. 

There had been a man, and to 
her it seemed that he was part of 
the green and windy world, and he 
had found her sleeping by the river. 
Even in her drowsy state, Helen 
had suspected that perhaps one of 
the other crew members, like her- 
self sleepless and drawn to the shin- 
ing water, had happened upon her 
there; such things were not impos- 
sible, manners and mores being 
what they were among starship 
crews. 

But to her, half-dreaming, there 
had been some strangeness about 
him, which prevented her from 
seeing him too clearly even in the 
brilliant green moonlight. No 
dream and no man liad ever 
seemed so living to her; and it was 
her fierce rationalization of the 
dream which kept her silent, 
months later, when she discovered 
(to her horror and secret despair) 
that she was with child. She had 
felt that she would lose the haze 
and secret delight of the dream, if 
she openly acknowledged that 
Colin had fathered her child. 

But at first — in the cool green 
morning that followed — she had not 
been at all sure it was a dream. 
Seeing only sunlight and leaves, she 
had held back from speaking, not 
wanting ridicule; could she have 
asked each man of the Starholniy 
Was it you who came to me last 
night? Because if it was not, there 
are other men on this world, men 
who cannot be clearly seen even 
by moonlight — 

Severely she reminded herself, 
Merrihew’s men had pronounced 
the world uninhabited, and unin- 

THE WIND PEOPLE 



habited it must be. Five years later, 
hugging her sleeping son close, 
Helen remembered the dream, ex- 
amined the content of her fantasy, 
and once again, shivering, repeated, 
‘T had a hallucination. It was only 
a dream. A dream, because I was 
alone. 



HEN ROBIN was fourteen 
years old, Helen told him the 
story of his birth, and of the ship. 

He was a tall, silent boy, strong 
and hardy but not talkative; he 
heard the story almost in silence, 
and looked at Helen for a long time 
in silence, afterward. He finally 
said in a whisp>er, “You could have 
died — you gave up a lot for me, 
Helen, didn’t you?” He knelt and 
took her face in his hands. She 
smiled, and drew a little away from 
him. 

“Why are you looking at me like 
that, Robin?” 

The boy could not put instant 
words to his thoughts; emotions 
were not in his vocabulary. Helen 
had taught him everything she 
knew, but slie had always concealed 
her feelings from her son. He asked 
at last, “Why didn't my father stay 
with you?” 

“I don’t suppose it entered his 
head,” Helen said. “He was needed 
on the ship. Losing me was bad 
enough.” 

Robin said passionately, “I’d 
have stayed!” 

The woman found herself laugh- 
ing. “Well — you did stay, Robin.” 

He asked, “Am I like my fa- 
ther?” 

Helen looked gravely at her son, 

21 





trying to see the half-forgotten fea- 
tures of young Reynolds in the boy’s 
face. No, Robin did not look like 
Colin Reynolds, nor like Helen her- 
self. She picked up his hand in 
hers; despite his robust health, 
Robin never tanned; his skin was 
pearly pale, so that in the green 
sunlight it blended into the forest 
almost invisibly. His hand lay in 
Helen’s palm like a shadow. She 
said at last, “No, nothing like him. 
But under this sun, that’s to be ex- 
pected.” 

Robin said confidently, “Fm like 
the other people.” 

“The ones on the ship? They — ” 

“No,” Robin interrupted, “you 
always said, when I was older you’d 
tell me about the other people. I 
mean the other people here. The 
ones in the woods. The ones you 
can’t see.” 

Helen stared at the boy in blank 
disbelief. “What do you mean? 
There are no other people, just us.” 
Then she recalled that every im- 
aginative child invents playmates. 
Alone, she thought, Robin's always 
alone, no other children, no wonder 
he's a little — strange. She said, 
quietly, “You dreamed it, Robin.” 

The boy only stared at her, in 
bleak, blank alienation. “You 
mean,” he said, “you can’t hear 
them either?” He got up and 
walked out of the hut. Helen 
called, but he didn’t turn back. She 
ran after him, catching at his arm, 
stopping him almost by force. She 
whispered, “Robin, Robin, tell me 
what you mean! There isn’t anyone 
here. Once or twice I thought I 
had seen — something, by moon- 
light, only it was a ^eam. Please, 

22 



Robin — please — ” 

“If it’s only a dream, why are 
you frightened?” Robin asked, 
through a curious constriction in 
his throat. “If they’ve never hurt 
you — ” 

No, they had never hurt her. 
Even if, in her long-ago dream, 
one of them had come to her — and 
the sons of God saw the daughters 
of men that they were fair — a scrap 
of memory from a vanished life on 
another world sang in Helen’s 
thoughts. She looked up at the pale, 
impatient face of her son, and 
swallowed hard. 

Her voice was husky when she 
spoke. 

“Did I ever tell you about ra- 
tionalization — when you want 
something to be true so much that 
you can make it sound right to 
yourself?” 

“Couldn’t that also happen to 
something you wanted not to be 
true?” Robin retorted with a mu- 
tinous curl of his mouth. 

Helen would not let go his arm. 
She . begged, “Robin — no, you’ll 
only waste your life and break your 
heart looking for something that 
doesn’t exist — ” 

The boy looked down into her 
shaken face, and suddenly a new 
emotion welled up in him and he 
dropped to his knees beside her and 
buried his face against her breast. 
He whispered, “Helen, I’ll never 
leave you. I’ll never do anything 
you don’t want me to do, I don’t 
want anyone but you — ” 

And for the first time in many 
years, Helen broke into wild and 
uncontrollable crying, without 
knowing why she wept.

Robin did not speak again of his 
quest in the forest. For many 
months he was quiet and subdued, 
staying near the clearing, hovering 
near Helen for days at a time, then 
disappearing into the forest at dusk. 
He heard the winds numbly, deaf 
to their promise and their call. 

Flelcn too was quiet and with- 
drawn, feeling Robin’s alienation 
through his submissive mood. She 
found herself speaking to him 
sharply for being always under 
foot; yet, on the rare days when he 
vanished into the forest and did 
not return until after sunset, she 
felt a restless unease that set her 
wandering the paths herself, not 
following him, but simply uneasy 
unless she knew he was within call. 

Once, in the shadows just before 
sunset, she thought she saw a man 
moving through the trees, and for 
an instant, as he turned toward 
her, she saw that he was naked. 
She had seen him only for a second 
or two, and after he had slipped 
between the shadows again, com- 
mon sense told her it was Robin. 
She was vaguely shocked and an- 
noyed ; she firmly intended to speak 
to him, perhaps to scold him for 
running about naked and slipping 
away like that; then, in a sort of 
remote embarrassment, she fore- 
bore to mention it. But after that, 
she kept out of the forest. 

Robin had been vaguely aware 
of her surveillance and knew when 
it ceased. But he did not give up 
his own pointless rambles, although 
even to liimself he no longer spoke 
of searching, or of any dreamlike 
inhabitants of the woods. At times 
it still seemed that some shadow 



concealed a half-seen form, and the 
distant murmur grew into a voice 
that mocked him ; a white arm, the 
shadow of a face, until he lifted 
his head and stared straight at it. 

One evening toward twilight he 
saw a sudden shimmer in the trees, 
and he stood, fixedly, as the stray 
glint resolved itself first into a white 
face with shadowy eyes, then into a 
translucent flicker of bare arms, 
and then into the form of a woman, 
arrested for an instant with her 
hand on the bole of a tree. In the 
shadowy spot, filled only with the 
liisL I ay of a cloudy sunset, she was 
very clear; not cloudy or unreal, 
but so distinct that he could see 
even a small smudge or bramble- 
scratch on her shoulder, and a 
fallen leaf tangled in her colorless 
hair. Robin, paralyzed, watched her 
pause, and turn, and smile, and 
then she melted into tlie shadows. 

He stood with his heart pound- 
ing for a second after she had 
gone; then whirled, bursting with 
the excitement of his discovery, 
and ran down the path toward 
home. Suddenly he stopped short, 
the world tilting and reeling, and 
fell on his face in a bed of dry 
leaves. 

He was still ignorant of the na- 
ture of the emotion in him. He felt 
only intolerable misery and the con- 
viction that he must never, never 
speak to Helen of what he had 
seen or felt. 



H e lay there, his burning face 
pressed into the leaves, un- 
aware of the rising wind, the little 
flurry of blown leaves, the growing 

23 



THE WIND PEOPLE 




dsu'kncss and distant thunder. At 
last an icy spatter of rain aroused 
him, and cold, numbed, he made 
his way slowly homeward. Over his 
head the boughs creaked woodenly, 
and Robin, under the driving 
whips of the rain, felt their tumult 
only echoed his own voiceless 
agony. 

He was drenched by the time he 
pushed the door of the shack open, 
and stumbled blindly toward the 
fire, only hoping that Helen would 
be sleeping. But she started up from 
beside the hearth they had built 
together last summer. 

“Robin?” 

Deathly weary, the boy snapped, 
“Who else would it be?” 

Helen didn’t answer. She came 
to him, a small swift-moving figure 
in the firelight, and drew him into 
the warmth. She said, almost hum- 
bly, “I was afraid — the storm — 
Robin, you’re all wet, come to the 
fire and dry out.” 

Robin yielded, his twitching 
nerves partly soothed by her voice. 
How tiny Helen isy he thought, and 
1 can remember that she used to 
carry me around on one arm. Now 
she hardly comes to my shoulder. 
She brought him food and he ate 
wolfishly, listening to the steady 
pouring rain, uncomfortable under 
Helen’s watching eyes. Before his 
own eyes there was the clear mem- 
ory of the woman in the wood, and 
so vivid was Robin’s imagination, 
heightened by loneliness and un- 
diluted by any random impressions, 
that it seemed to him Helen must 
see her too. And when she came to 
stand beside him, the picture grew 
so keen in his thoughts that he ac- 

24 



tually pulled himself free of her. 

The next day dawned gray and 
still, beaten with long needles of 
rain. They stayed indoors by the 
smoldering fire; Robin, half sick 
and feverish from his drenching, 
sprawled by the hearth too indolent 
to move, watching Helen’s comings 
and goings about the room; not 
realizing why the sight of her slight, 
quick form against the gray light 
filled him with such pain and mel- 
ancholy. 

The storm lasted four days. 
Helen exhausted her household 
tasks and sat restlessly thumbing 
through the few books she knew 
by heart — they had allowed her to 
remove all her personal possessions, 
all the things she had chosen on a 
forgotten and faraway Earth for a 
ten-year star-cruise. For the first 
time in years, Helen was thinking 
again of the life, the civilization she 
had thrown away, for Robin who 
had been a pink scrap in the circle 
of her arm and now lay sullen on 
the hearth, not speaking, aimlessly 
whittling a stick with the knife 
(found discarded in a heap of rub- 
bish from the Starholm) which 
was his dearest possession. Helen 
felt slow horror closing in on her. 
What world, what heritage did I 
give him, in my madness? This 
world has driven us both insane. 
Robin and I are both a little mad, 
by Earth's standards. And when I 
die, and I will die first, what then? 
At that moment Helen would have 
given her life to believe in his old 
dream of strange people in the 
wood. 

She flung her book restlessly 
away, and Robin, as if waiting for 

MARION ZIMMER BRADLEY 




that signal, sat upright and said 
almost eagerly, “Helen — 

Grateful that he had broken the 
silence of days, she gave him an 
encouraging smile. 

“I’ve been reading your books,” 
he began, diffidently, “and I read 
about the sun you came from. It’s 
different from this one. Suppose — 
suppose, if there were actually a 
kind of people here, and something 
in this light, or in your eyes, made 
them invisible to you?” 

Helen said, “Have you been see- 
ing them again?” 

He flinched at her ironical tone, 
and she asked, somewhat more 
gently, “It’s a theory, Robin, but it 
wouldn’t explain, then, why you see 
them.” 

“Maybe I’m — ^more used to this 
light,” he said gropingly. “ — And 
anyway, you said you thought you’d 
seen them and thought it was only 
a dream.” 

Halfway between exasperation 
and a deep pity, Helen found her- 
self arguing, “If these other peo- 
ple of yours really exist, why 
haven’t they made themselves 
known in sixteen years?” 

The eagerness with which he an- 
swered was almost frightening. “I 
think they only come out at night, 
they’re what your book calls a 
primitive civilization — ” He spoke 
the words he had read, but never 
heard, with an odd hesitation. 
“They’re not really a civilization at 
all, I think, they’re like — part of 
the woods.” 

“A forest people,” Helen mused, 
impressed in spite of herself, “and 
nocturnal. It’s always moonlight 
or dusky when you see them — ” 

THE WIND PEOPLE 



“Then you do believe me — oh, 
Helen,” Robin cried, and suddenly 
found himself pouring out the 
story of what he had seen, in in- 
coherent words, concluding “ — and 
by daylight I can hear them, but 
I can’t see them — Helen, Helen, 
you have to believe it now, you’ll 
have to let me try to find them and 
learn to talk to them — ” 

Helen listened with a sinking 
heart. She knew they should not 
discuss it now, when five days of 
enforced housebound proximity 
had set their nerves and tempers on 
edge, but some unknown tension 
hurled her sharp words at Robin. 
“You saw a woman, and I — a man. 
These things are only dreams. Do 
I have to explain more to you?” 
Robin flung his knife sullenly 
aside. “You’re so blind, so stub- 
born — ” 

“I think you are feverish again.” 
Helen rose to go. 

He said wrathfully, “You treat 
me like a child!” 

“Because you act like one, with 
your fairy tales of women in the 
wind. 

Suddenly Robin’s agony over- 
flowed and he caught at her, hold- 
ing her around the knees, clinging 
to her as he had not done since he 
was a smaU child, his words stum- 
bling and rushing over one another. 

“Helen, Helen darling, don’t be 
angry with me,” he begged, and 
caught her in a blind embrace that 
pulled her off her feet. She had 
never guessed how strong he was; 
but he seemed very like a little boy, 
and she hugged him quickly as he 
began to cover her face with child- 
ish kisses. 



25 




“Don’t cry, Robin, my baby, it’s 
all right,” she murmured, kneeling 
close to him. Gradually the wild- 
ness of his passionate crying 
abated; she touched his forehead 
with her cheek to see if it were 
heated with fever, and he reached 
up and held her there. Helen let 
him lie against her shoulder, feeling 
that perhaps after the violence of 
his outburst he would fall asleep, 
and she was half asleep herself 
when a sudden shock of realization 
darted through her; quickly she 
tried to free herself from Robin’s 
entangling arms. 

“Robin, let me go.” 

He clung to her, not understand- 
ing. “Don’t let go of me, Helen. 
Darling, stay here beside me,” he 
begged, and pressed a kiss into her 
throat. 

Helen, her blood icing over, real- 
ized that unless she freed herself 
very quickly now, she would be 
fighting against a strong, aroused 
young man not clearly aware of 
what he was doing. She took refuge 
in the sharp maternal note of ten 
years ago, almost vanished in the 
closer, more equal companionship 
of the time between: 

“No, Robin. Stop it, at once, do 
you hear?” 

Automatically he let her go, and 
she rolled quickly away, out of his 
reach, and got to her feet. Robin, 
too intelligent to be unaware of her 
anger and too naive to know its 
cause, suddenly dropped his head 
and wept, wholly unstrung. “Why 
are you angry?” he blurted out. “I 
was only loving you.” 

And at the phrase of the five- 
year-old child, Helen felt her throat 

26 



would burst with its ache. She man- 
aged to choke out, “I’m not angry, 
Robin — we’ll talk about this later, I 
promise — ” and then, her own con- 
trol vanishing, turned and fled 
precipitately into the pouring rain. 

She plunged through the familiar 
woods for a long time, in a daze of 
unthinking misery. She did not 
even fully realize that she was sob- 
bing and muttering aloud, “No, no, 
no, no — ” 

She must have wandered for sev- 
eral hours. The rain had stopped 
and the darkness was lifting before 
she began to grow calmer and to 
think more clearly. 

She had been blind, not to fore- 
see this day when Robin was a 
child; only if her child had been a 
daughter could it have been 
avoided. Or — she was shocked at 
the hysterical sound of her own 
laughter — if Colin had stayed and 
they had raised a family like Adam 
and Eve! 

But what now? Robin was six- 
teen; she was not yet forty. Helen 
caught at vanishing memories of 
society ; taboos so deeply rooted that 
for Helen they were instinctual and 
impregnable. Yet for Robin nothing 
existed except this little patch of 
forest and Helen herself — the only 
person in his world, more specifical- 
ly at the moment the only woman 
in his world. So much, she thought 
bitterly, for instinct. But have I the 
right to begin this all over again? 
Worse; have I the right to deny its 
existence and when I die, leave 
Robin alone? 

She had stumbled and paused for 
breath, realizing that she had wan- 
dered in circles and that she was 



MARION ZIMMER BRADLEY 




at a familiar point on the river bank 
which she had avoided for sixteen 
years. On the heels of this realiza- 
tion she became aware that for only 
the second time in memory, the 
winds were wholly stilled. 

H er eyes, swollen with crying, 
ached as she tried to pierce the 
gloom of the mist, lilac-tinted with 
the approaching sunrise, which 
hung around the water. Through 
the dispersing mist she made out, 
dimly, the form of a man. 

He was tall, and his pale skin 
shone with misty white colors. 
Helen sat frozen, her mouth open, 
and for the space of several seconds 
he looked down at her without 
moving. His eyes, dark splashes in 
the pale face, had an air of infinite 
sadness and compassion, and she 
thought his lips moved in speech, 
but she heard only a thin familiar 
rustle of wind. 

Behind him, mere flickers, she 
seemed to make out the ghosts of 
other faces, tips of fingers of in- 
visible hands, eyes, the outline of 
a woman’s breast, the curve of a 
child’s foot. For a minute, in 
Helen’s weary numbed state, all 
her defenses went down and she 
thought: Then Vm not mad and it 
wasn't a dream and Robin isn't 
Reynolds' son at all. His father was 
this — one of these — and they've 
been watching me and Robin, 
Robin has seen them, he doesn't 
know he's one of them, but they 
know. They know and I've kept 
Robin from them all these sixteen 
years. 

The man took two steps toward 
THE WIND PEOPLE 



her, the translucent body shifting 
to a dozen colors before her blurred 
eyes. His face had a curious 
familiarity — familiarity — and in a 
sudden spasm of terror Helen 
thought, ‘T’m going mad, it’s 
Robin, it's Robin — 

His hand was actually out- 
stretched to touch her when her 
scream cut icy lashes through the 
forest, stin'ing wild echoes in the 
wind-voices, and she whirled and 
ran blindly toward the treacherous, 
crumbling bank. Behind her came 
steps, a voice, a cry — Robin, the 
strange dryad-man, she could not 
guess. The horror of incest, the son 
the father the lover suddenly melt- 
ing into one, overwhelmed her reel- 
ing brain and she fled insanely to 
the brink. She felt a masculine hand 
actually gripping her shoulder, she 
might have been pulled back even 
then, but she twisted free blindly, 
shrieking, '^No, Robin, no, no — ” 
and flung herself down the steep 
bank, to slip and hurl downward 
and whirl around in the raging 
current to spinning oblivion and 
death . 

Many years later, Merrihew, 
grown old in the Space Service, 
falsified a log entry to send his ship 
for a little while into the orbit of 
the tiny green planet he had named 
Robin’s World. The old buildings 
had fallen into rotted timbers, and 
Merrihew quartered the little world 
for two months from pole to pole 
but found nothing. Nothing but 
shadows and whispers and the un- 
ending voices of the wind. Finally, 
he lifted his ship and went away.

In the cities, 350 billions 



swarmed like termites in a 



hill; but Jeremiah Winthrop 



still called himself a man. 



THE 



GOOD 

WORK 

By 

THEODORE L. THOMAS 



T all and rawboned was 
Jeremiah Winthrop. Narrow of 
shoulder and shallow of chest he 
was, but no matter. There was a 
dignity to the man that showed it- 
self in every movement. Here was 
one who still called himself a man, 
one whose traditions sprang from 
the rocky New England soil that 
had nourished his forebears. The 
mold that produces such a man is 
not easily bent or broken, not even 
in a world of three hundred and 
fifty billion people, not even in a 
world where the rocky New Eng- 
land soil lies buried and forgotten 
beneath the foundations of mon- 
strous buildings. 

Jeremiah Winthrop rode the 
spiral escalator up, up to the two- 
part cubicle he called home on the 
one hundred and forty-eighth floor. 
He stood swaying slightly as the es- 
calator wound its serpentine way 
upwards. Others rode with him, 
tight people, tense people, pushed 



28 




together, staring straight as they 
rode the spiral escalator up. And 
now and then at a turn or a bend a 
man would elbow his way out. He’d 
leave the upflowing river of people 
and step onto a landing as his floor 
came by. But the escalator was still 
crowded as it passed the one hun- 
dred and forty-eighth floor and 
Winthrop stepped off. He was not 
one of the lucky ones who lived high 
near the roof where it was at least 
possible to think about the air and 
the light and the sun. 

Winthrop boarded a moving belt 
that carried him over to liis own 
corridor. He walked down the cor- 
ridor for ten minutes. It was easy 
walking, for there were far fewer 
people now. Finally he came to his 
own door. He inserted his thumb in 
the thurnbhole, slid the door open 
and walked in. A tousle-headed 
youngster sat on the floor playing 
with a plastic box. The boy looked 
up as Winthrop entered. 

“Daddy!” he shouted. He flung 
himself to his feet, dashed across the 
room and grabbed his father around 
the legs. 

“Hello, Davy,” said Winthrop, 
ruffling the curly brown hair. 
“How’s the little man?” 

“Fine, Daddy. And Mommy says 
we can go up on the roof in another 
month. Will you come with us? This 
time? You never go with us. Daddy. 
Will you come up with us in a 
month from now?” 

Winthrop looked over the boy’s 
head at his wife, Ann. The smile 
faded from his face. He said, “A 
month? I thought it was our turn 
again in a week. What happened?” 

Ann shook her head and pressed 



the back of a hand against her fore- 
head. “I don’t know. They have 
had to re-schedule evei7body. An- 
other eighteen hundred babies born 
in the building this week. They all 
have to get a little sun. I don’t 
know.” 

Winthrop pushed Davy gently to 
one side and held tlie boy to him as 
he walked over to Ann. He put a 
hand in the small of her back and 
held her against his chest. She 
rested her head against the upper 
part of his arm and leaned against 
him. 

Ann lifted her head, stood on her 
toes and kissed Winthrop. She 
pulled away and led him over to a 
chair, Davy still hanging on to his 
leg. “You must be tired,” she said. 
“Ten hours you’ve been out. Were 
you able to . Did you — ” 

“No,” said Winthrop. “Nothing. 
Not so much as a soybean.” He 
looked at his wife and smiled. “I 
guess the time has come for us to 
eat that potato. We’ve been saving 
it for a month.” 

Ann’s eyes wiinkled as she looked 
down at him. “Oh. I — I gave it to 
the Brookses. They haven’t had 
anything in weeks.” The words be- 
gan to pour out. “We have done 
so well, really, in the last few weeks 
that I felt sorry for them. We had 
those cabbage leaves and three po- 
tatoes and even tliat piece of fish 
four months ago. I couldn’t help 
myself. I gave — I gave our potato 
to them. They were so sick of 
Standard Fare they wei'e beginning 
to get depressed, really depressed. 
I—” 

Winthrop reached up and put an 
arm around her hips and said, 



29 




“Don’t think about it, darling.” He 
was silent for a moment, and then 
he continued, “I think I’ll go down 
and see if John Barlow has some 
work for me. Let’s have a quick 
dinner of Standard Fare and then 
I’ll go.” He got up and walked over 
to the sink and began washing 
Davy’s hands, talking, joshing, teas- 
ing a little as he did so. 

Ann took three glasses from the 
tiny cabinet. She went to the syn- 
thetic milk faucet and filled the 
glasses and then put them on the 
table. She went to the bread slot 
and removed six slices of bread. 
One after the other she dropped the 
six slices of brown bread through 
the toaster. She picked up a knife 
and scooped big gobs of rich yellow 
synthetic butter out of the butter 
slot and spread it on the toast. She 
made a pile of the toast on a plate 
and then cut the pile in half. “All 
right,” she called. And she put the 
toast on the table and sat down. 

Winthrop helped Davy into a 
chair and then sat down himself. 
He bent his head and spoke a brief 
blessing. And they all ate. They ate 
Standard Fare, as countless billions 
of other people did that night, and 
every night, from birth to death, 
Standard Fare. 

When the meal was done Win- 
throp got up and kissed Ann and 
Davy goodbye. He rode down the 
spiral escalator, down to the ground 
floor, and below. Great throngs of 
people rode with him, crowded in 
on each other. He rode down to the 
fifteenth sub-level and changed to a 
belt. He rode past the crowded TV 
theaters, the amusement halls. He 
stepped off and went down a nar- 

30 



row side alley where some of the 
shops were. Immediately the crowds 
fell off. A litde way down the alley 
Winthrop turned into the door of a 
tiny store. It was empty except for 
John Barlow, the owner. 

“Nice to see you,” said Barlow, 
springing up and taking Winthrop’s 
hand. “I was just thinking about 
you. In fact, I was going to come 
up and see you in the next day or 
two. Come in and sit down.” 

Barlow sat in the chair, Winthrop 
on the small counter. The two men 
filled the store completely. “That 
sounds good, John. Do you have 
some work for me?” 

Barlow looked long at Winthrop, 
and slowly shook his head. “No, 
Jeremiah. No. I don’t even have 
work for myself any more.” He hesi- 
tated a moment and went on quiet- 
ly, “I’m going out of business, 
Jeremiah. I can’t make it work. I 
don’t take in enough money to keep 
my stock up. People don’t need 
money, what with free movies and 
clothes and food and everything 
else. No one buys food. They ^1 live 
on Standard Fare and they don’t 
seem to care any more. So now I’ll 
have to join them, unless I can find 
other work.” 

“I’m very sorry, John. I feel I 
helped drive you out of business. I 
never gave you money for what I 
took.” 

Barlow shook his head. “No, Jere- 
miah. You always worked for every- 
thing. Other people are not as will- 
ing to work as you are ; they all want 
something for nothing. Who else 
would be vaccinated and take the 
immunization shots so he could go 
all the way across the city for me the

way you do?” 

They sat quietly. Winthrop said, 
''Where is it all going to end, John? 
What’s going to happen to every- 
body?” 

‘T don’t know. Some people 
work; there must be jobs some- 
where. 1 suppose they get them 
through the Ministry of Govern- 
ment Employment, and you know 
what people say about that. Gov- 
ernment workers won’t even talk 
about it; everybody says they’re 
ashamed of it. I don’t know what’s 
going to happen. Except — I’m 
through. I’m going to take my stock 
home with me tonight, and that 
ends it.” 

VV^inthrop looked at the box that 
contiiined all of Barlow’s stock. The 
box measured about one foot on a 
side. 

“Jeremiah, I want you to have 
something.” Barlow reached down 
to the bottom of the box and 
brought out an object that he held 
toward Winthrop. 

Winthrop looked at it and 
gasped. “An egg. A real hen’s egg. 
I recognize it from the pictures.” 
Winthrop looked up. “But I can’t 
take it, John. I can’t.” 

“I want you to have it, Jeremiah. 
I want you and Ann and Davy to 
have it. Now don’t argue. I’ll wrap 
it up and you take it right home.” 

Barlow turned and lifted a small 
box down from a niche. He lined 
the box with synthetic cotton and 
gently nestled the egg in the center. 
After covering the egg with another 
layer of cotton, he closed the box 
and wrapped it and tied it with a 
broad white ribbon under which he 
slipped a litde card of cooking in- 

THE GOOD WORK 



structions. Then he handed the box 
to Winthrop. “Take it home, Jere- 
miah. I’ll be up to see you sometime 
soon. Go on now.” And he urged 
Winthrop off the counter and out 
the door. 

Winthrop went, holding the box 
in both hands. As he worked his 
way through the crowds, he held 
the box to his stomach, turning his 
shoulders to meet the press of peo- 
ple. He was still holding it with 
both hands half an hour later when 
he entered his home. 



A nn looked up, surprised. 

“Jeremiah, I didn’t expect you 
home so soon.” Her eyes fixed on 
the package. “What is it? What 
have you got?” 

Winthrop walked to the table, 
put the package on it, and carefully 
began to open it without saying a 
word. Ann and Davy stood close to 
him; Davy climbed on a chair to 
see better. When Winthrop lifted 
off the top layer of cotton, Ann's 
eyes widened and she clasped her 
hands together and stared, silently. 
“What is it, Daddy?” 

“It’s an egg, son. A hen’s egg.” 
“Is it something to eat?” 

“Yes, son. It is.” Winthrop looked 
at his wife and said, “Shall we eat 
it now?” 

Ann nodded, quickly read the 
cooking instructions, and set about 
preparing scrambled egg. Winthrop 
got out the cooking pan, wiped off 
the dust, and set it down near her. 
She smiled at him and put a large 
chunk of butter in it and placed the 
pan on the heater. When the butter 
bubbled, she poured the beaten egg 

31 




into the pan; it hissed as it struck 
the hot butter. She began to stir the 
egg as it cooked. Winthrop picked 
Davy up so he could see into the 
pan as die egg thickened. In a mo- 
ment it was done. 

Ann lifted three small dishes from 
a cupboard, placed them on the 
table, and carrfully scraped the egg 
onto the plates. Buttered toast and 
milk came next, then they sat down 
to eat. Winthrop said a grace. 
They ate in silence. 

Davy looked up after his egg was 
gone and said, ‘T don’t like it very 
much. I like it some, but not very 
much.” 

Winthrop reached over and ruf- 
fled his hair, saying to Ann, “It 
would have been better if we’d had 
some salt, I guess. But it was good 
anyway. I’ve often wondered what 
an egg tasted like.” 

He looked down at the empty 
plates and stared at them. Then he 
said quickly, “Davy, it’s your bed- 
time. You hop on in now.” 

Davy’s face grew long, but then 
Winthrop looked at him, and he 
climbed off his chair and went over 
and pulled his father down and 
kissed him on the cheek. “Good 
night, Daddy.” 

“Good night, son.” 

Ann took Davy by the hand and 
led him into the bedroom. Win- 
throp listened to the chatter and 
then to the prayers. He sat and 
listened as he stared at the three 
egg-stained plates on the table. The 
plates pushed into his mind, occu- 
pied it, filled it, until there was 
nothing else. And at that moment 
the integrity of Jeremiah Winthrop 
broke. 



He was still staring at the plates 
when Ann came out and sat down 
beside him. She too looked at her 
husband, looked, and looked again, 
closer. There were tears in his eyes. 

She leaned toward him and put 
a hand on his shoulder. “What is it, 
Jeremiah?” she asked quietly. 

He turned full toward her, 
started to speak, but could not. He 
pointed to the dirty plates and then 
cleared his throat. “Ann, that’s the 
last of it. It’s getting worse all the 
time. There’s no work for a man. 
What are we going to do? Is Davy 
going to live the rest of his life 
satisfied with Standard Fare? Can 
we watch him grow up not knowing 
what it feels like to work? Ann ...” 
He stopped and sat quietly for a 
moment. “I’ve got to go to the 
Ministry of Government Employ- 
ment.” 

She said, “Jeremiah, are you 
sure? We’ve always been able to 
manage on our own. We’ve never 
needed help from the government.” 

“Ann — ” He stood up and began 
pacing across the room. “How can 
we sit and watch this happen to our 
boy? We can’t take him out in all 
those people very often. We can’t 
take him to the roof. Ann, he’s a 
good boy. We can’t let him live like 
this.” 

“But how will you feel? You have 
to make your own way. You’ve al- 
ways believed that.” 

Winthrop’s stooped figure bent 
even more. He stopped pacing and 
stood with his hands hanging at his 
sides, his chin on his chest. “I 
know,” he said quietly. “I know. 
Help me, Ann. What should we 
do?”

She flew across the room to him 
and they cUtng together. After a 
moment she said, “All right, Jere- 
miah. I knew this would come some 
day. We will go down tomorrow to 
the Ministry of Government Em- 
ployment and see if they have any 
work for you. Maybe they have, 
and maybe it won’t be so bad. May- 
be it’s good work after all. We’ll 



T he family was up early the 
next morning, up and eating 
Standard Fare. After breakfast they 
began to get ready to go out. Ann 
went over all the clothes, sponging 
spots off the slick fabric. Jeremiah 
Winthrop paced back and forth 
with slow measured steps, his hands 
clasped behind him, his head bent. 

Ann took a little cord harness 
from the cabinet and slipped it over 
Davy’s head. She pulled the cords 
taut and tied them around him. She 
passed a light piece of cord around 
her waist and tied the other end of 
it to Davy’s harness. She tied a 
second piece of cord to the other 
side of the harness. Then she said 
to Winthrop, “Jeremiah, we’re 
ready.” 

Winthrop stepped over to Davy’s 
side. He passed the second piece of 
cord around his waist and tied it 
fast. “I’m ready,” he said. 

They went out the door and it 
was not bad at first. Riding down 
the spiral escalator it began to get 
crowded ; people pressed shoulder 
to shoulder. Davy clutched a 
parent’s hand in each of his own. 
When they anived at the bells be- 
low ground-level, the press grew 

THE GOOD WORK 



greater. Ann and Winthrop used 
their legs to make room for Davy 
to stand on the moving belt. The 
upper portions of their bodies 
pushed out against the packed mass 
of humanity. They held their arms 
bent at the elbows to form a bridge 
around Davy’s head, stooping a lit- 
tle to do so. Silently they pushed 
back against the surge of people. 

They changed belts by waling in 
a kind of lockstep and again formed 
a trembling bridge with their arms 
around Davy on the next belt. 
Twice more they changed belts and 
in two hours they arrived at the 
building nexi to their own. It was 
easier, going up the spiral escalator. 

They came out into a huge room 
filled with people. Holding tight 
to Davy’s leash, they worked their 
way through the crowds, seeking a 
regisiration desk. In half an hour 
they found one. 

The line of people was only a few 
hundred yards long in front of that 
particular desk. Jeremiah and Ann 
joined the line at the end, smiling 
at each other. In four short hours 
they found themselves at the desk. 

Winthrop gave his name and 
number to the man and explained 
why he wanted an interview with 
one of the ministers. The man 
swiftly filled out a set of papers, as- 
signed Winthrop a line number and 
a chair number, and pointed the di- 
rection to take. 

Jeremiah, Ann, and Davy slowly 
passed through the crowds in the 
room, this time seeking their line. 
They finally found it and Winthrop 
gave his papers to tlie man in 
charge. Again they were fortunate. 
The line to which Winthrop was as- 

33 




signed did not even reach out into 
the room; the end of it had pro- 
gressed into the long corridor that 
led to the minister’s office. 

Winthrop settled into his moving 
chair wliile Ann and Davy bustled 
around him and made him com- 
fortable. Then they said goodbye. 

“Ann, be careful going home. Go 
very slowly. Don’t be afraid to 
scream out if Davy begins to get 
crushed.” 

“Don’t worry, dear. We’ll be all 
right.” Ann smiled at him, but her 
eyes were too bright. 

Winthrop saw it and stood up 
from his chair. “I’ll take you home 
and then come back.” 

“No.” She gently pushed him 
back into the chair. “We’ll lose an- 
other day, and Davy and I will be 
all right. Now you just stay here. 
Goodbye, dear.” She leaned over 
and kissed him. 

Winthrop said, “All right, but 
don’t visit me, Ann. I’ll be home as 
soon as this is over, and it’s too hard 
on you to make the trip alone.” 

She smiled and nodded. Win- 
throp kissed Davy and ruffled his 
hair. Then Ann tied both ends of 
Davy’s leash around her waist, and 
she and Davy walked off. Both of 
them turned to wave frequently 
until the crowd swallowed them up. 

The days passed slowly for Win- 
throp. The corridor seemed to 
stretch on interminably as he slowly 
moved down it in his chair. Every 
few hundred yards there was the 
inevitable milk faucet and the bread 
and butter slots, and every few feet 
there was the inevitable TV screen 
alive with people talking, singing, 

34 



laughing, shouting, or playing. Win- 
throp turned each one off ais he 
came abreast of it, if his neighbors 
did not object. None of the people 
in the line were talkative, and that 
suited Winthrop. Mostly he sat 
thinking over his forthcoming inter- 
view. Two minutes to explain why 
he should be given work was not 
vei7 long. But the Ministers of 
Government Employment were 
busy men. 

Toward the end of the second 
week Winthrop had a surprise visit 
from Ann. She threw her arms 
around him and explained that 
Helen Barlow had come to see her 
and had sent Ann off to visit. And 
it was while Ann was there that 
Winthrop moved up to a position 
from which he could see the door 
of the minister’s office. When Ann 
left, she went with the comforting 
knowledge that it would be only a 
few days more. 

The time came when Winthrop 
was at the door. Then, suddenly, he 
was in the anteroom, and before 
he could fully realize it he was 
standing in a very small room be- 
fore the minister. 

Winthrop identified himself and 
said, “I have a boy of four, a fine 
boy, and a fine wife too. I want to 
work the way a man should to give 
them something besides Standard 
Fare. Here is what I have worked at 
in the last five years.” And Win- 
throp listed the things he had done. 

The minister listened. He had 
white hair and a lined face whose 
skin seemed to be pulled too tight. 
When Winthrop had finished, the 
minister looked steadily into his face 
for a moment; Winthrop could al- 

THEODORE L. T.HO/V^AS 




most feel the probing of the level 
blue eyes. Then the minister turned 
to a device that loomed over him to 
one side and punched a complex 
series of buttons. There was a whir- 
ring noise behind the wall of the 
tiny room, and then a small packet 
of cards appeared at the slot in the 
bottom of the device. The minister 
picked them out and glanced at 
them, and an odd expression of sad- 
ness swept across his face. It was 
gone in an instant, and then he 
looked up and said, “Yes, Mr. Win- 
throp. We have a job for you, and 
the full six hours a day, too. You 
will be on the maintenance crew 
of your building. Your job is ex- 
plained here — ” he passed over a 
card — “and it consists of tightening 
the nuts on the expansion joints in 
the framework of the building. It 
is very important to do it right, so 
read the card carefully.” Winthrop 
nodded eagerly. 

The minister handed over an- 
other card and said, “Here is a 
description of the daily reports you 
must turn in.” Another card. “Here 
is how you and your chief decide 
your working schedule, and you 
must adhere to it; it is very impor- 
tant. The chief of your tightening 
crew will go over it with you. Here 
is your requisition for the special 
wrench you will need. Here is your 
pay schedule ; you can decide if 
you want to be paid in money or 
produce. And one very important 
thing.” The minister leaned for- 
ward to emphasize his remarks. 
“You are not allowed to talk about 
your job with anyone, not even with 
your best friends. Is that clear?” 

Winthrop nodded. “Yes, sir.” 

THE GOOD WORK 



“The reason is that we do not 
want people fighting over jobs. Not 
many who come in here really want 
to work, but there are a few. We 
have to pick good men for this 
work; those buildings must be kept 
in good condition. Others less for- 
tunate than you might not under- 
stand that you are just the man we 
need. So no talking about your 
work — no talk of any kind — on pain 
of dismissal.” The minister sat back. 
“Well, I guess that is about all. Re- 
port for work in the morning. Good 
luck.” And he held out his hand. 

Winthrop shook it and said, 
“Thank you, sir. ITl work hard for 
you. 1 didn’t know you needed men 
for this work or I would have been 
here sooner. I had always heard 
that . Well, thank you.” And 
Winthrop turned to go. Out of the 
comer of his eye as he turned, he 
thought he saw again that ephemer- 
al expression of sadness, but when 
he looked the minister full in the 
face it was gone. Winthrop went out 
the side door. The entire interview 
had taken one and three quarter 
minutes. 



W INTHROP left early the next 
morning so as not to be late 
for work. As it turned out, he was 
unable to get off a belt at the 
proper landing — too many people 
in the way — and it took him fifteen 
minutes to retrace his steps. He ar- 
rived exactly' on time. 

The chief of the tightening crew 
was a big, bluff man with a red 
face. He took Winthrop in tow and 
showed liim how tliey worked. The 
crew chief had a vast knowledge of 

35 




the crawl spaces in the interior of 
the building. He showed Winthrop 
the blueprints from which the tight- 
ening crew worked, and explained 
that by coordinating their work 
with all the other tightening crews 
they made one complete round of 
the building every eight years. By 
then it was time to do it again ; the 
nuts worked loose from the constant 
expansion and contraction. It was 
quite a job keeping track of the 
area that the tightening crew cov- 
ered; it was a large crew. But each 
member turned in daily reports, 
and there was a large clerical staff 
to keep the records straight. In fact, 
there were more men keeping 
records than there were doing the 
actual tightening work. The chief 
pointed out that Winthrop was to 
be one of the elite, one of those 
whose work justified the existence 
of the huge staff. The tone of the 
chief’s voice made it clear that there 
was a kind of quiet pride among 
the men who did the actual work. 
The chief issued Winthrop his 
wrench and showed him where to 
start. 

The day passed swiftly. The tight- 
ening of the nuts was not so bad, 
although Winthrop’s arm grew sore 
after a while. The difficult part was 
gaining access to the nuts in the 
first place. Winthrop had to use all 
his agility to wriggle through con- 
fined places. Yet it was good to be 
working again, good to feel the 
sweat start from his brow from hard 
work instead of from the press of 
people. 

In a week Winthrop was no 
longer dog-tired when he got home 
at night. There was much laughter 

36 



in the Winthrop household, much 
reading and playing games and tell- 
ing stories. They even watched the 
TV screen now and then ; somehow 
it no longer seemed so fruitless. The 
monotony of Standard Fare was 
broken; the head of the house was 
working steadily. It was now possi- 
ble to plan ahead for a variety of 
meals, and that made it easier to 
wait when there was nothing to eat 
but Standard Fare. 

Winthrop developed skill and 
speed at locating and tightening the 
nuts. He soon covered in a day a 
larger area than any other man, 
and the chief told him that he was 
his best man. Winthrop came to 
share the pride and sense of respon- 
sibility that all the other tighteners 
felt. They were a select group, and 
they knew it; all the others looked 
up to them. 

It was after dinner one night that 
Winthrop sat back, hooked his 
thumbs in the armholes of his shirt, 
and watched Ann and Davy finish 
the half-dozen peas. They looked 
at him and smiled, and his heart 
warmed. “You know,” he said, “I 
think I’ll visit John Barlow for a 
few minutes. I haven’t seen him 
since he gave up his store. Do you 
mind, dear?” 

Ann shook her head. “No, you 
run along. I’ll play with Davy for 
a while and then put him to bed. 
Don’t stay too long.” 

Barlow answered Winthrop’s 
knock. “Well, Jeremiah. Come in, 
man, come in.” 

Winthrop walked in and the two 
men stood looking at each other. 
Winthrop was surprised at how well 
Barlow looked, and he said so. 

THEODORE L. THOMAS 




Barlow laughed. “Yes, the last 
time we met I was pretty far down 
in the dumps, I guess. But I’m 
working, Jeremiah. Fm actually 
working. Important work, too!” 

His enthusiasm was infectious 
and Winthrop found himself laugh- 
ing. “I’m glad for you, John. And 
I know how you feel, because Fm 
working too.” 

Barlow stepped forward and 
wrung his hand. “That’s fine, man, 
fine! Government, I guess, just like 
mine. It isn’t so bad, is it? Not 
nearly as bad as we thought. Good 
steady important work makes a man 
feel like it’s worth living.” 

Helen Barlow came out of the 
other room. “Why, Jeremiah. I 
didn’t know you were here. How 
nice to see you.” 

“Yes, and he’s working,” said 
Barlow. 



“Oh, I’m so happy for you, Jere- 
miah. Congratulations. And that re- 
minds me, John.” She turned to her 
husband. “You have to get ready to 
go to work. You know how long it 
takes to get there even though it’s 
in the building.” 

“Right. I’ll get ready. Jeremiah, 
I’m sorry that I have to go, but 
why don’t you stay?” 

“No, John. I just stopped in to 
say hello. You come up and see us 
real soon.” 

“I certainly will.” 

There was an exchange of good- 
byes, and Winthrop left. 

Barlow went into the other room 
and came out immediately with his 
wrench. He waved it playfully at 
his wife. “Got to go,” he said. “The 
loosening crew won’t wait.” And he 
blew a kiss at his wife and went off 
to work. END

THE MAN WHO 



T he car he’d stolen was a 
beautifully groomed thing: all 
polished lacquer and chrome, with 
almost brand-new dual tread white- 
wall tires on the nickeled wire 
wheels. But the transmission was 
bad, the brake drums scraped, and 
there was a short circuit in the wir- 
ing somewhere, so that he had to 
keep over sixty miles per hour or 



the generator would not charge at 
all. He would have stolen another 
one if he could, but he had got onto 
the turnpike before he realized just 
how unreliable this one was. If he 
changed cars at a restaurant, it 
would be reported and the police 
would stop him when he tried to 
leave the turnpike. 

No, he was trapped with what he

He had been waiting all his life for the aliens to turn up — and 
now that they were here, he knew exactly what to do. 



had. Hunched over the wheel of his 
roaring cage, the yellowish head- 
lights reflecting white from the lane 
markers, Redfern swept his eyes 
systematically over the instruments: 
ammeter, fuel gauge, oil pressure, 
water temperature, speedometer, 
odometer. He thought of himself 
as doing it systematically, every 
ten minutes, like a professionally 
trained driver. Actually, he was 
dividing his attention almost equal- 
ly between the road and the 
odometer. A hundred and ten miles 
covered, seventy miles to go, ninety 



TASTED ASHES 



for speedometer error. Say fifty-five 
miles per hour, indicated, average. 
Allow for odometer error. Say sixty 
miles per hour, indicated, average. 
Allow for unforeseen delays. Sixty- 
five miles per hour. 

Redfem’s foot trembled on the 
accelerator pedal. His thigh ached 
from hours of unremitting pressure. 
His car flashed by signboards, wove 



minutes before the ship was due to 
take off, with or without him, 
average speed required: 46.62, ap- 
prox.; round off to allow for stop- 
ping the car at the exit toll booth, 
for covering two miles of back 
roads, for leaving the car and run- 
ning an unknown distance across 
a weed-grown field to the ship’s air- 
lock — they would take off on sched- 
ule with him six inches from the 
slamming airlock door; they would 
not stay themselves a microsecond 
to accommodate him — say fifty 
miles per hour, average. Then allow 
continually around immense trailer 
trucks in the slow lane. His mind 
raced to keep up with the changing 
figures on the odometer. He wished 
he weren’t feeling a slight miss in 
the engine whenever he eased up 
on the accelerator. He cursed the 
car’s owner for his false-front 
prodigality with wax and white- 
walls. 

He looked at his watch again. 
Four in the morning. He turned 
the radio on, ignoring his fear that 
something else might happen to the 
car’s wiring. 

“ — And that’s the news,” the an- 
nouncer’s professionally relaxed 



39 




voice said. “After a word about 
United Airlines, we’U hear, first, 
Carl OrfTs Carmina Burana, fol- 
lowed by — ” 

His watch was slow. 

Five minutes? Fifteen minutes? 
How long did the news take? 

He held the watch to his ear. It 
was an expensive one, wafer thin, 
beautifully crafted, left over from 
his younger days — he could barely 
hear it running. Was it running at 
all? 

Redfem was a leathery man, his 
yellowish-white hair brushed back 
from angular temples, a scruffy 
Guards moustache over his nearly 
invisible lips. His suits were made 
for him by a London tailor, from 
measurements taken in 1925; they 
were gored and belted in the backs 
of the jackets. Outdoors, he wore a 
Burberry and carried a briefcase. 
People who saw him on the street in 
Washington always took him for 
someone with diplomatic connec- 
tions. But since Redfem was always 
seen afoot, these connections per- 
force had to be minor. Was he an 
assistant attache of sorts, perhaps? 
At his age? Looking at Redfem, 
people would wonder about it. 

People. But the man who’d sat 
easily on the edge of Redfem’s 
lumpy bed in the wallpapered hotel 
room — that man, now . 

That man had coal-black hair, 
broad, flat cheekbones above a 
sharply narrowing chin, oval, ma- 
roon-pupiled eyes and cyanotic lips. 
He smiled easily and agreeably 
across the room. 

Redfem sat in the one chair, sip>- 
ping at the water tumbler half-full 

40 



of gin. The bottle his visitor had 
brought up was standing on the bu- 
reau. His visitor, who had given the 
name of Charlie Spence, was not 
drinking. 

“You don’t look like a Charlie,” 
Redfem said abruptly over the tum- 
bler’s rim. “You look as cold as ice.” 

Spence laughed, his small mouth 
stretching as far as it could. “May- 
be I’m made of it,” he said. “But 
then, you’re nothing but a lump of 
coal. Carbon.” He bmshed his fin- 
gertips together. 

“But then,” Redfem mocked 
sharply, don’t pretend to be gre- 
garious.” 

“Oh, I don’t pretend — don’t pre* 
tend at all. I am gregarious. I love 
the company of people. I’ve been 
moving about among them for sev- 
eral years, now.” 

“All right,” Redfem said sharply, 
“we’ve already settled that. Let’s let 
it be. I don’t care where you come 
from — I don’t really care what 
you’re made of. It may surprise you, 
but I’ve thought for some time that 
if people were coming to this world 
from other places, they’d be bound 
to get in touch with me sooner or 
later.” 

“Why on Earth should we try to 
get in touch with you?” Spence 
asked, nonplused. 

“Because if you people have been 
coming here for years, then you’re 
not here openly. You’ve got pur- 
poses of your own. People with pur- 
poses of their own generally come to 
me. 

Charlie Spence began to chuckle. 
“I like you,” he laughed. “I really 
do. You’re a rare type.” 

“Yes,” said Redfem, “and now 

ALGIS BUDRYS 




let’s get down to business.” He ges- 
tured toward the bureau top. “Pour 
me some more of that.” Alcohol af- 
fected him swiftly but not deeply. 
Once it had stripped him of the 
ordinary inhibitions, he could go on 
drinking for some time before his 
intellect lost its edge. Since he al- 
ways took two aspirins and went 
straight to bed at that point, it was 
not a serious sort of weakness. But 
without his inhibitions he was a very 
unpleasant man. 

66|T’S A SIMPLE business,” 

X Charlie Spence was saying a 
little later. “The ambassador will 
land at National Airport and be 
met by the usual sort of reception 
committee. Red carpet, band, dig- 
nitaries, and so forth. But the red 
carpet will be a little shabby, the 
band won’t be first-rate, and the 
reception committee will not be 
quite as high-ranking as it might be. 
After all, the ambassador’s country 
is definitely on the other side of the 
fence.” 

“Yes,” Redfem drawled. “The 
protocol of prejudice.” 

“Oh, no, no, nothing deliberate,” 
Spence said, with a hand raised. 
“Diplomats pride themselves on 
equal courtesy to all. But the em- 
ployee in charge of caring for the 
carpets simply won’t do his best. 
The band won’t play with any great 
enthusiasm. And any of your offi- 
cials who happen to be ill, with 
colds or similar afflictions, will hon- 
estly decide their health precludes 
the effort of attending. This is sim- 
ply human nature, and any snub 
will be completely unintend^.” 

THE MAN WHO TASTED ASHES 



“I heard you the first time. 
What’s all this to do with me?” 

“Well, now,” Charlie Spence ex- 
plained, “the ambassador’s not from 
a particularly large nation in their 
bloc. It seems doubtful they’d 
bother to send along any of their 
own security police. The only 
guards present will likely be Ameri- 
can Secret Service personnel, ex- 
tending courtesy protection.” 

“Yes.” 

“So. In the first place, the am- 
bassador is really a small fish. In the 
second place, no American, even a 
trained professional sworn to his 
duty^ is apt to be quite as devoted 
to the ambassador’s life as he would 
be to that of, say, any American 
congressman. Those two factors 
represent a potential assassin’s mar- 
gin of safety.” 

“And what’re you meddling in 
our politics for?” Redfem growled. 

^‘Your politics? Redfem, my dear 
fellow, it may or may not be your 
planet, but it’s most assuredly our 
solar system.” 

The neck of the bottle tinked 
against the lip of Redfem’s glass. 
“And I’m your assassin?” 

“You are.” 

“What makes you think I’ll do 
it?” Redfem cocked his head and 
looked narrowly at Spence. 

“A compulsive need to meddle in 
human history.” 

“Oh?” 

Charlie Spence laughed. “You 
were cashiered from your country’s 
foreign service in nineteen hundred 
and thirty-two. But you’ve never 
stopped mixing into international 
situations. Gun mnning, courier 
work, a little export-import, a little 

41 




field work for foreign development 
corporations . and, now and then, 
a few more serious escapades. Don’t 
tell me you don’t enjoy it, Redfern. 
It’s a very hard life, all told. No one 
would stay in it as long as you have 
if it didn’t satisfy his need for 
power.” 

Redfern pinched his lips together 
even more tightly, in the fleeting re- 
flex with which he always acknowl- 
edged the truth. “I wasn’t cash- 
iered,” he said. resigned without 
prejudice.” 

“Oh, yes; yes, you did. Being un- 
pleasant to one’s superiors doesn’t 
disgrace a man — it merely makes 
him unemployable. Except for spe- 
cial purposes that don’t require a 
pukka sahib. And here I am, as 
you said, with a special purpose. 
Ten thousand dollars, on comple- 
tion, Redfern, and the satisfaction 
of having started World War III.” 

Redfern’s eyes glittered. “All over 
one little ambassador?” he asked 
carefully. 

“Over one little ambassador. In 
life, he’s not considered worth the 
trouble of protecting him. And no 
one but a rather stout and liverish 
woman in the Balkans will mourn 
him in death. But when he dies, his 
side will suddenly discover a great 
and genuine moral indignation. 
Why? Because they will be truly 
shocked at such a thing happening 
in America.” 

“World War III,” Redfern said 
ruminatively. 

“Exactly. You’ll shake the am- 
bassador’s hand. An hour later, 
when he’s already safe inside his 
embassy refreshing himself after his 
trip, he’ll fall into a sudden coma. 

42 



The embassy will close its doors, is- 
sue a misleading statement, and 
call its doctor.’* 

“Yes.” 

“Very well. The embassy staflf 
has taken routine steps, and waits 
for the ambassador to recover. But, 
just to allow for all eventualities, 
the unofficial courier service is al- 
ready transmitting a notification to 
the government at home. The doc- 
tor examines the patient and dis- 
covers an inflamed puncture on his 
right hand. Another message goes 
home. The ambassador dies, and 
tests indicate poison. Obviously, it 
was hoped the puncture would go 
unnoticed and the cause of death, 
which resembles cerebral occlusion, 
would be mistaken. But the tiny 
needle must not have been quite 
sterilized, by accident, and the 
clever doctor has penetrated the 
scheme — and another message goes 
home, before the American State 
Department even suspects anything 
serious.” 

“Hmm. I’ll simply shake his 
hand?” 

Charlie Spence reached into his 
pocket. “Wearing this." He held 
out a crumpled something, the size 
of a handkerchief. Redfern took it 
and unfolded it. “A mask,*’ Spence 
said. “Drawn over your head, it 
will mold new features for you. 
It’ll be devilish uncomfortable, but 
you won’t have to wear it long.” 

“It’ll make me look like someone 
entitled to be on the field?” 

Spence grinned the grin of a 
Renaissance Florentine. “Better 
than that. It will give you the com- 
fxjsite features of six people entitled 
to be on the field. You will look like 



ALGIS BUDRYS 




none of them, but you will look 
superficially familiar to anyone who 
knows any of them. The subsequent 
questioning of witnesses will yield 
amusing results, I think.” 

‘‘Very clever. Good technique. 
Confuse and obscure. But then, 
you’ve practiced it a long time.” 
Redfern pushed himself abruptly 
out of the chair and went into the 
adjoining bathroom, keeping the 
door open. “Excuse me,” he said 
perfunctorily. 

“Lord, you’re a type!” Charlie 
Spence said. ‘ Will you do it?” 

“What?” Redfern said from the 
bathroom. 

“Will you do it?” Spence re- 
peated, raising his voice. 

Redfern came out, picking up 
the gin bottle, and sat back down in 
the chair. He tipped the bottle over 
the glass. “Maybe.” 

“I’ve told you too much for you 
to back out now,” Spence said with 
a frown. 

“Rubbish!” Redfern spat. “Don’t 
try to bully me. You don’t care 
what any of the natives tell each 
other about you. There are dozens 
of people living off their tales about 
you. It’s to your advantage to 
hire native helpers wherever you 
can — if they’re caught, who cares 
what wild tales they tell? You’d be 
insane to risk losing one of your dwn 
people.” He looked sharply into 
Charlie Spence’s eyes. “I don’t sup- 
pose you fancy the thought of a dis- 
secting table.” 

Charlie Spence licked his lips 
with a flicker of his tongue. “Don’t 
be too sure of yourself,” he said 
after a moment, in a more careful 
tone of voice. 



Redfern snorted. “If I acted only 
on what I was sure of. I’d still be an 
embassy clerk.” 

“And you wouldn’t like that, I 
suppose?” Charlie Spence, recov- 
ered, was looking around the room. 
“Sometimes? At night, when you 
can’t sleep?” 

“I want an out,” Redfern said 
brusquely. “I won’t do it without 
accident insurance.” 

“Oh?” Charlie Spence’s eyebrow's 
quivered. 

“If I’m caught at the field. I’m 
caught and that’s it. I’ll protect 
you.” 

“Professionalism. I like that. Go 
on — what if you get away from the 
field?” 

“If I get away, but there’s trou- 
ble, I want a rendezvous with one 
of your ships.” 

“Oh, ho!” Charlie Spence said. 
“You do, do you?” 

“I’ll cover my tracks, if you think 
it’s important, but I want a rendez- 
vous. I want to be off this planet 
if there’s trouble. Change that — I 
want to be off it in any case, and if 
there’s no trouble, I can always be 
brought back.” 

“Oh, ho!” Charlie Spence re- 
peated with a grin. “Yes, I’d think 
you would want to watch the next 
war from some safe place.” It was 
easy to see he’d been expecting Red- 
fern to lead up to this all along. 

“Have it your way,” Redfern said 
ungraciously. 

Charlie Spence was laughing si- 
lently, his eyes a-slit. “All right, 
Redfern,” he said indulgently. He 
reached into his card case, took out 
a photograph of a dumpy blonde 
woman and a string-haired man 



THE MAN WHO TASTED ASHES 



43 




on the porch of a middle western 
farmhouse, and carefully split it 
with his thumbnails. Out of the cen- 
ter, he took a bit of tissue paper, 
and stuck the front and back of the 
photograph together again. Replac- 
ing the card case in his pocket, he 
handed the slip of paper to Redfern. 
“Dip it in your drink,” he said. 
He watched while Redfern com- 
plied, but kept his eyes away from 
the short handwritten directions the 
alcohol brought up. “Don’t repeat 
the location aloud. I don’t know it, 
and don’t want to. Memorize it and 
destroy it. And I tell you now, Red- 
fern, if the ambassador doesn’t die, 
there’ll be no ship.” He smiled. 
“For that matter, you have no guar- 
antee there’ll be any ship at all.” 
Redfern growled. “I know.” 
“Lord, what meager hopes you 
live on, Redfern!” 

“You’re through here now, aren’t 
you?” Redfern said. 

“Yes . .” Charlie Spence said 
with pursed lips. 

“Then get out.” He took the 
palm hyp^ermic Charlie Spence 
handed him in its green pasteboard 
box, and closed the hotel room door 
behind his visitor. 



T hirty-five miles to go. His 

watch now read 4:30. It hadn’t 
stopped, but was merely slow. If 
he’d thought to have it cleaned by 
a jeweler, last year or even the year 
before that, it would be accurate 
now. As it was, he had less than an 
hour, and he would be off the turn- 
pike fairly soon, onto roads that 
were pav^ but had been laid out 
in the days of horse-drawn wagons. 

44 



He tried another station on the 
radio, but that was playing popular 
music. A third was conducting some 
sort of discussion program about 
water fluoridation. And that was 
all. The rest of the dial yielded 
only hisses or garbled snatches from 
Minneapolis or Cincinnati. His am- 
meter showed a steady discharge as 
long as the radio was on, no matter 
how fast he drove. He turned it off 
and steered the car, his face like a 
graven image. He was seething with 
anger, but none of it showed. As an 
adolescent, he had made the mis- 
take of equating self-possession with 
maturity, and had studiously prac- 
ticed the mannerism, with the in- 
evitable result that he had only 
learned to hide his feelings from 
himself. He was the prisoner of his 
practice now, to the extent that he 
often had to search deep to find 
what emotion might be driving him 
at any particular time. Often he 
found it only in retrospect, When it 
was too late. 

That lunch with Dick Farleagh 
this afternoon . 

It had been difficult even to reach 
him: a call to the embassy — ''Who 
shall I tell Mr. Farleagh is calling? 
Mr. Redfern?” and then the barely 
muffled aside, a whispered “Oh, 
dear.” Then the pause, and finally, 
with a sigh: “Mr. Farleagh will 
speak to you now, Mr. Redfern,” as 
though the secretary thought a bad 
mistake was being made. 

“Dickie,” Redfern said heavily. 

“What is it, Ralph?” Farleagh’s 
voice was too neutral. Obviously, 
he had taken the call only out of 
curiosity, because he had not heard 

ALGIS BUDRYS 




directly from Redfem in nearly 
fifteen years. But he must already 
be regretting it — probably he didn’t 
like being called Dickie, now that 
his junior clerk days were well be- 
hind him. Redfern ought to have 
thought of that, but he was in a 
hurry, and hurry, like liquor, always 
took away his social graces. 

“I have to speak to you.” 

“Yes?” 

Redfem waited. Only after a mo- 
ment did he understand that Far- 
Icagh had no intention of meeting 
him in person. 

“I can’t do it over the telephone.” 

“I see.” Now the voice was crisp, 
as Farleagh decided he could meet 
the situation with routine proce- 
dure. “I’ll ask my secretary to make 
an appointment. She’ll call you. 
Can you leave a number?” 

“No, no, no!” Redfern was shout- 
ing into the telephone: “I won’t be 
fjj^bcd off like that!” His words and 
actions were registering on his con- 
sciousness in only the haziest way. 
He had no idea he was shouting. 
“This is too important for your 
blasted conventionalities! I won’t 
put up with it! I have to see you.” 
His voice was wheedling, now, 
though he did not realize that, 
either. “Today. No later than 
lunch.” 

Farleagh said with quiet shock, 
“There’s no need to rave at me. 
Now, take hold of yourself, Ralph, 
and perhaps we can talk this out 
sensibly.” 

“Will you come or won’t you?” 
Redfern demanded. “I’ll be at the 
Grosvenor bar in an hour. I’m 
warning you you’ll regret it if you 
don’t come.” 



There was a long pause, during 
which there was a sudden buzz in 
the phone, and the sound of Red- 
fern’s coin being collected. In a mo- 
ment, the operator would be asking 
for another dime. 

“Are you there?” Farleagh asked 
with maddening detachment. “See 
here, Redfern — ” now the tenor of 
his thinking was unmistakeable in 
his voice, even before he continued 
— “if it’s a matter of a few dollars 
or so, I can manage it, I suppose. 
I’ll mail you a check. You needn’t 
bother to return it.” 

“Deposit ten cents for the next 
three minutes, please,” the operator 
said at that moment. 

“I don’t want your blasted 
money!” Redfern cried. “I have to 
see you. Will you be there?” 

“I — ” Farleagh had begun when 
the operator cut them off. 

Redfern stared in bafflement at 
the telephone. Then he thrust it 
back on its cradle and walked 
briskly out of the booth. 

He waited in the Grosvenor bar 
for an hour and a half, rationing his 
drinks out of a sense that he ought 
to keep his head. He was not a 
stupid man. He knew that he al- 
ways got into quarrels whenever 
he’d been drinking. 

He rationed his drinks, but after 
the first one he did so out of a spite- 
ful feeling that he ought to, to 
please that stuffed shirt Farleagh. 
He already knew that if Farleagh 
appeared at all, their meeting 
would not do the slightest good. 
Hunched over his drink, glowering 
at the door, he now only wanted to 
be able to say, afterwards, that he 



THE MAN WHO TASTED ASHES 



45 




had made the utmost effort to do 
rhe right thing. 

Farleagh came, at last, looking a 
great de^ beefier than he had when 
he and Redfem were in public 
school together. His handshake was 
perfunctory — his maddeningly level 
gray eyes catalogued the changes in 
Redfem’s face with obvious disap- 
proval — and he practically shep- 
herded Redfem to the farthest and 
darkest table. Obviously, he did not 
relish being seen in a public place 
with a man of Redfern’s character. 
Redfem drawled : “You’ve gone to 
fat.” 

Farleagh’s eyes remained steady. 
“And you to lean. What is it you 
want, Redfem?” 

“If it isn’t money?” Redfern’s 
mouth curled. He turned and sig- 
naled to a waiter. “What will you 
have, Dickie?” 

“None for me, thank you,” Far- 
leagh said in an impassive drone. 
“I’m pressed for time.” 

“Are you? You’ve no idea, do 
you, that I might be on a close 
schedule myself.” Redfem glanced 
at liis watch. The ambassador’s 
plane was due at National Aiiport 
in two hours, and there was a great 
deal still to be done. “You’ve kept 
me waiting.” He waved the waiter 
away in sudden irritation, without 
ordering. “Now, you listen to me,” 
he told Farleagh. “I’m going to be 
at a definite place and time tonight. 
Here.” He flicked the balled bit of 
tissue paper across the table into 
Farleagh’s lap. 

Farleagh picked it out and trans- 
ferred it to a side pocket. He would 
have been a very bad diplomat if 
he had ignored it. But it was plain 

46 



he was merely providing for an ex- 
tremely remote possibility. “Red- 
fera,” he said, “if you’re attempting 
to involve my government in some 
scheme of yours, that will be the 
end. You’ll have gone too far.” 

“Our government, Dickie,” Red- 
fem almost snarled. “I still carry 
my passport.” 

“Precisely,” Farleagh said. “I’m 
sure the American authorities 
would deport you, at our request. If 
you stand trial at home, you’ll not 
get off easily.” 

“There’s nothing in my past 
record that breaks the law at 
home.” 

“There’s a great deal about you 
that breaks laws more popular than 
those in books.” 

“Damn you, Farleagh,” Redfem 
said in a voice he did not know was 
high and almost tearful, “you’d bet- 
ter be there tonight.” 

“Why?” 

“Because if you aren’t^ and I do 
get involved in something, it’ll be 
found out soon enough that you 
could have been there. I warn you 
now, Farleagh, if I go down, it 
won’t be easily. Perhaps it won’t 
matter to you if your career’s 
smashed. I tell you now, there’s a 
great deal more involved in this 
than your career.” 

Farleagh was still not taking his 
eyes away from Redfern’s face, nor 
moderating the set of his mouth. He 
gave the appearance, sitting there 
in his expensive suit, with his gray- 
ing black hair combed down sleekly, 
of enormous patience nearly at an 
end. 

“Very well then!” Redfem ex- 
claimed. “I don’t care if you believe 

ALGIS BUDRYS 




me or not.” He thrust his chair 
back. “But if someone gets ill who 
shouldn’t, today, you’d better be- 
lieve me!” He stalked away, his 
Burberry flapping from his arm, his 
briefcase banging into the backs 
of chairs, his face an unhealthy 
red. 



H e drove vengefully, in a rage 
that included the car and the 
radio, his watch, Farleagh, Charlie 
Spence and the world. 

Five o’clock, by his watch. He 
turned into the exit ramp with a 
squealing from the tires, and one 
part of his mind was hoping there 
would be a blowout, just to prove 
something to the car’s owner. He 
touched the brakes almost reluc- 
tantly, and at the same time cursed 
their criminal softness. He fumbled 
on the seat beside him for the toll 
ticket, and searched in his nearly 
empty wallet. He had had to spend 
a good deal of money today — ^more 
than he’d expected, for the drug 
and the explosive. It had never 
been his intention to steal a car, but 
rental had been out of the question. 
He knew, and damned the fact, 
that another man might have got- 
ten better prices with his suppliers. 
But what sort of logic was there in 
making up to criminals; slapping 
their backs and buying them drinks, 
talking to them on an equal basis, 
when he could not even see the 
need to do that sort of thing in his 
dealings with respectable people? 

He slapped the ticket and his 
two remaining dollar bills into the 
toll attendant’s palm, and acceler- 
ated again without bothering even 

THE MAN WHO TASTED ASHES 



to look toward the man. He had 
seen no sign of drawn-up police 
cars anywhere around the toll 
plaza. That was the important 
thing, the only important thing at 
the moment. 

Now that he was off the turn- 
pike, he forgot he had been so 
afraid of being stopped for automo- 
bile theft. It had been another in 
a succession of thin-edged risks 
which could be shown to extend 
back to the beginning of his inde- 
pendent life. He forgot it as he had 
forgotten his fears concerning all 
the others — as he had forgotten 
that he had been afraid something 
would go wrong at the airport this 
afternoon, or that he would be 
caught as he hung about in Wash- 
ington for hours afterward, until 
he was sure the embassy was act- 
ing as if something were wrong 
b^nd its doors. 

As he drove now, forcing his car 
around the twisting mountain cor- 
ners, he had other things to be 
afraid of. 

Farleagh might not be there — 
might have been stubborn, or un- 
accountably stupid, or simply too 
slow, in spite of the margin Red- 
fem had allowed him. He looked at 
his watch again as he turned off 
onto a dirt track leading almost 
straight up the hill. Five- twenty by 
his watch. He had perhaps five min- 
utes. 

He took one deep breath — one, 
and no more, just as he had done 
at the airport gate this afternoon, 
and as he had done on other occa- 
sions in his life — and drove the car 
into a tangle of shrubbery just past 
a mortared-stone culvert that was 

47 




his position marker. He shut off the 
ignition and sat as if stupefied by 
the engine’s silence. Almost in- 
stantly, the headlights were no 
more than a sickly orange glow 
upon the leaves pressed against the 
car’s grille. He shut them off, 
picked up his briefcase, and aban- 
doned the car. Burberry flapping 
around his thighs, he trotted across 
the road and plunged down a slight 
decline into a stand of tamaracks. 
It was dark except for the remain- 
ing light of a low half -moon seep- 
ing through the overcast. 

He moved with practiced effi- 
ciency through the trees, keeping 
his ffirection by paralleling the 
brook that had trickled through the 
culvert, until he emerged without 
warning into an open and long- 
neglected field, choked with pro- 
liferating brush, entirely surround- 
ed by evergreens, with the space- 
ship, tall as an oil refinery^s crack- 
ing tower, standing in its center. 

The airlock door in the side of it 
was open. Redfern began tc^ force 
his way through the brush, toward 
the extended ladder which con- 
nected the airlock with the ground. 
There was a single light in the lock 
chamber. No other lights were vis- 
ible — the ship was a complex sil- 
houette of struts and vanes, given 
the reality of depth only by that 
open door, and what that door 
might lead to, Redfern could not 
really guess. 

As he struggled up to the ladder, 
he was arming the satchel charge 
in his briefcase. 

There was still no sign of life 
from inside the ship. But as he 
climbed the ladder, hoisting him- 

48 



self awkwardly with his one free 
hand, the ladder began to retract 
with the sound of metal sliding into 
metal, and other mechanical 
sounds resonated out of the hull, 
like generators coming up to speed, 
and relays in a sequence of switch- 
ing operations. He looked up and 
saw the airlock door quiver and 
begin to turn on its massive hinges. 

With a strained motion of his 
arm, he threw the charge overarm 
into the airlock, and let go the lad- 
der. He heard the briefcase thump 
to the deck in the lock chamber, 
while he himself was falling ten or 
twelve feet back to the ground. 
When the explosion came, he was 
sprawled on the ground, rearing 
up on his out-thrust arms, and he 
stared in fascination at the flame- 
shot billow of orange smoke gout- 
ing through the still half-open lock. 

He rolled, off to one side, as the 
outer door rebounded from the 
hull. He was afraid it might fall on 
him, but then he saw it was still 
hanging, like a broken gate. 

The starting-noises inside the 
ship came to a complete slop. He 
had done what he had hoped to do 
— breached the hull, and activated 
the safety cut-offs in the controls. 
The ship was caught, earthbound, 
possibly not for very long, but per- 
haps for long enough. 

The brusli crackled and plucked 
at his passage. He could not bring 
himself to look away from the ship, 
and he blundered through the un- 
dergrowth with his arms behind 
him, feeling his ^vay. The light in 
the airlock chamber was off now, 
but something was still burning in 
there, with a dull smoldering red 

ALGIS BUDRYS 




flicker. 

A hand placed itself flat between 
his shoulderblades. “All right, easy 
now, sir,” a voice said. 

He turned convulsively, his face 
contorted as if by pain, and made 
out a tall, huskily built young man 
in a narrow-brimmed hat, who was 
holding a short-barreled revolver 
in his other hand. The brush was 
parting all around him — there were 
many men here — and suddenly a 
portable floodlight shot up a beam 
to strike the airlock. 

“We were just about ready to 
send a man aboard when you crip- 
pled them, sir,” the young man 
said \vith his trained politeness. 

“Is Farleagh here?” Redfern de- 
manded. 

“Yes, sir, Mr. Farleagh’s back 
among the trees, with the chief.” 

A man had stepped up to the 
base of the ship, where the ladder 
had rested. Like Redfern’s young 
man, he wore a civilian suit as if it 
had been made by a uniform manu- 
facturer. “Aboard the ship!” he 
shouted up through cupped hands. 
“Can you hear me? Do you speak 
English? This is the Secret Serv- 
ice.” 

There was a grating sound up in 
the lock chamber, as someone 
forced open the balky inner door. 
Then a man stumbled up to the 
edge and looked down, his white 
coveralls smudged and a strained 
look on his face. He squinted at the 
Secret Service man. 

“Jesus Christ, yes, I speak Eng- 
lish,” he said in outrage. “Who 
threw that bomb? This is a god- 
damn Air Force project, and there’s 
gonna be all kinds of hell.” 



“Oh, no, you don’t!” Redfern 
shouted, mortally afraid things 
could still go wrong. “It won’t wash 
— not with me to testify against 
you.” 

The Secret Service man at the 
base of the ship turned his head 
in Redfern’s direction long enough 
to show his exasperation. Then he 
pointed his pistol up at the man 
in the lock. “‘Jump down, you.” 
There was the sound of someone 
heavy coming toward them through 
the brush. After a moment, Far- 
leagh said: “There you are.” 
“Hullo, Dickie.” Redfern grinned 
at Farleagh in the spottily reflected 
light. “Now you know.” 

“Know what?” Farleagh asked 
heavily. 

Redfern shifted his feet nervous- 
ly. “Why I got myself cashiered 
years ago. You see I knew they 
were coming here — at least, I be- 
lieved they were — and I decided 
what sort of human being they 
would be most likely to contact.” 
Rage crossed Farleagh’s face at 
last, and shocked Redfern. “Stop 
it, Redfern,” he said savagely. “For 
once in your life, admit you’re the 
sort of man you are.” 

After that, no one seemed to look 
at him. An improvised ladder was 
brought up, and Secret Service men 
went into the ship and came down 
again escorting sullen, blue-lipped 
men. The clearing became full of 
activity as the prisoners were hand- 
cuffed together, machines and rec- 
ords brought down out of the ship; 
and Redfern watched it all, just as 
he had been watching all his life, 
from the outside. END 



THE MAN WHO TASTED ASHES

Love and Moondogs 




BY RICHARD MCKENNA 



''The true dog, madame, was 
originally the golden jackal, 
Canis aureus . He must love 
and be loved, or he diesJ*' 



T he headline on the news- 
papers stacked in front of the 
drugstore read “RUSS DOG 
REACHES MOON ALIVE.” A 
man in a leather jacket stopped to 
scan it. 

Across the street, frost lay crisp 
on the courthouse lawn, and the 
white and tan spotted hound put 
up his forepaws on the kitchen 
stool as if to warm them. The four 
women were too busy hauling down 



50 



the flag to notice. 

Martha Stonery in the persian 
lamb coat paid out the halyard. 
Monica Flint in the reddish musk- 
rat and Paula Hart in the brown 
fox caught the flag and folded it, 
careful not to let it touch the wet 
cement. A postman and the man 
in the leather jacket stopped on the 
sidewalk to watch'. 

Martha, plump face grim under 
pinchnose spectacles, fastened one 
halyard snap to a metal ring taped 
and wired to the dog’s right hind 
leg. 

“Hoist away, girls.” 

Monica, Paula and Abigail Silax 
in nutria hauled in unison while 
Martha held the flag. The hound 
scrabbled with his forepaws and 
barked frantically. As he went 
struggle-twisting upward he began 
to howl in a bell-like voice. The 
women grunted with elTort. People 
were coming across the lawn and 
pale faces moved behind the court- 
house windows. 

“Two block,” Martha said. 
“Vast hauling and belay.” 

She pulled the kitchen stool 
nearer the flagpole and climbed on 
it to face the small crowd across 
the shelf of her bosom. Cars were 
stopping, people streaming in from 
all sides. Martha patted her piled 
gray hair and made her thin lips 
into a parrot beak. 

“Fellow Americans!” she cried 
above the howling. “Our leaders 
are cowards and it is time for the 
people to act before the Russians 
come and murder us all in our 
beds! We, the United Dames of 
the Dog, hereby protest the Russian 
crime of putting a trusting, loving 



dog on the moon to starve and 
freeze and smother and die of lone- 
liness! This dog above our heads 
cries out to the world against the 
Russian breach of faith between 
dog and man. He will stay there 
until the Russians bring their dog 
home safely or make amends for 
their crime!” 

“Like hell!” said the man in the 
leather jacket, moving in. 

''Martha!'' Abigail shrieked. 
“He’s taking it down!” 

Monica pulled at his wrists. 
Paula slapped and scratched at 
his face. “You brute! You coward!” 
they shrilled. 

Martha jumped off the stool and 
kicked him. He backed avyay, bent 
and holding himself. 

“Look, ladies,” he gasped, “for 
God’s sake — ” 

“Here now, here now, this is 
county property,” said a fat man in 
shirtsleeves with pink sleeve garters, 
pushing through the crowd. 
“What’s all this? Take that dog 
down, somebody!” 

“Never!” Martha snapped. She 
put her back against the halyard 
cleat, unfolded the flag and draped 
it around herself. A loose strand of 
gray hair fell across her face. 

“If you’re so big and brave, go 
bring down the Russian dog,” she 
told the fat man coldly. 

“Now listen, lady,” the fat man 
said. The Clarion press photog- 
rapher was sprinting across the 
lawn. 



G eorge stonery was tail, 

thin, stooped and anxious in a 
gray business suit. 



•51 




“I came as soon as I could,” he 
told Sheriff Breen across the 
scarred, paper-littered wooden 
desk. “I was away checking one of 
our warehouses.” 

“You can make bail for her in 
two minutes, right across the hall,” 
the sheriff said, scratching his jowl. 
“She wouldn’t make it for herself, 
said we had to lock her in our 
sputnik.” 

“Where is she now?” 

“In the sputnik.” 

The desk phone rang and the 
sheriff growled into it, “Hell you 
say. State forty-three just past Roy 
Farm? Right. I s’ pose you already 
heard what we had on the lawn 
here this morning?” 

The phone gave forth an excited 
gobbling. The sheriff’s red eye- 
brows rose in disbelief and his 
heavy jaw dropped in dismay. He 
put down the phone. 

“That was city,” he told Stonery. 
“Complaint about a dog hanging 
by one leg from a tree just outside 
city limits. But it’s going on all over 
town too — dogs hanging on trees, 
out of windows, off clotheslines — 
every squad car is out. Your old 
lady sure started something!” 
“What did she do?^^ Stonery 
asked in anguish. 

The sheriff told him. “Kicked a 
big fat deputy where it hurts, too. 
Maybe we ought to hold her after 
all. She says she’s president of the 
United Dogs of something.” 

“United Dames of the Dog,” the 
thin man corrected. “They hold 
meetings and things. She started it 
when the Russians put up their 
second sputnik.” 

“Well, I hope none of them 

52 



dames lives out in the county,” the 
sheriff said, rising. “You fix up bail, 
Mr. Stonery. I got to send out a 
deputy.” 

Walking past the flagpole with 
her husband, Martha Stonery wore 
an exalted look. 

“All over America dogs will cry 
out in protest against the Russian 
crime,” she said. “1 have kindled a 
flame, George, that will sweep away 
the Kremlin. I, a weak wom- 
an. .” 

She insisted on driving herself 
home in her new station wagon. 

Sirening police cars passed Ston- 
ery three times as he drove home 
in the evening. Outside the tan 
stucco ranch-style house on Euclid 
Avenue, cars blocked the drive- 
way and a crowd milled on the 
lawn. Stonery parked undei* the oak 
tree at the curb and got out. 

Martha stood in the living room 
by the picture window and ha- 
rangued the crowd through a 
screened side panel. Centered in 
the window her spaniel Fiffalo 
writhed, hanging by a hind leg 
from the massive gilt floor lamp 
and yipping piteously. Martha had 
on her suit of gray Harris tweed 
and her diamond brooch. 

“. moral pressure the Russians 
simply cannot resist,” Stonery 
heard her shouting as he joined die 
crowd. “The men talk, but the 
United Dames of the Dog are not 
afraid to act. Putting a dear little 
dog on the moon to die of heart- 
break!” 

Several young men near the win- 
dow scribbled on white pads. 

“How many members do you 

RICHARD McKENNA 




have, Mrs. Stonery?” one asked. 

“The U.D.D. is bigger than you 
think, young man. Bigger than the 
Russians think, for all their spies 
and traitors!” 

Stoneiy sidled in and tried the 
front door. 

“She locked it,” one of the re- 
porters told him. “The cops went 
back for a warrant. Say! You’re 
Stonery!” 

“Yes,” the thin man said, flush- 
ing. A press camera flashed and he 
put up his hands too late to shield 
his face. 

“Give us a statement, Mr. Ston- 
ery, before the cops come back,” 
the reporters clamored. 

Stonery backed off, waving his 
hands. “Please, please,” he said. 

“She cracked?” a reporter asked. 
“When did you first notice?” 

“Please,” Stonery said. “Yes, 
she’s upset. Her oldest son went 
into the state penitentiary in Cali- 
fornia last week. She’s very upset 
about it.” 

“He kill somebody?” the same 
reporter asked. 

“No, oh no . just armed rob- 
bery . please don’t print that, 
boys.” 

“Here come the cops back!” 
someone shouted. 

Two policemen crossed the lawn, 
one waving a paper. “Here is our 
warrant of forcible entry, Mrs. 
Stonery,” he called out. He began 
reading it aloud. 

“The U.D.D. will not shrink 
from any extremes of police bru- 
tality,” Martha cried sharply. Fif- 
falo struggled and yelped louder. 

The second policeman smashed 
the lock with a ten-pound sledge. 

LOVE AND MOONDOGS 



The reporters swept Stonery into 
the house with them. One police- 
man untied Fiffalo and held him in 
his arms. He strained his head back 
and away from the spaniel’s whim- 
pering kisses. Martha glared self- 
lessly while flash bulbs popped. 

Stonery pulled gently at the 
other policeman’s sleeve. 

“May I come along, officer?” he 
asked. “I’m her husband. I’ll have 
to arrange bail.” 

“Not taking her,” the policeman 
said. “No room left in the pokey. 
Since two o’clock we been arrest- 
ing the dogs.” 

T he bellboy put down the 
silver bucket of ice cubes, 
pocketed the quarter and went out. 
The skinny secretary put a bottle 
of whisky beside it and turned to 
that fat adjutant sprawled shoeless 
on the bed. 

“Looks like Governor Bob’ll be 
a while yet, Sam,” the secretary 
said. “Shall we drink without 
him?” 

“Hell yes, I need one, Dave,” 
the adjutant said in his frog voice, 
wiggling his toes. “Bob must be 
having himself a time with that 
Stonery d^me.” He chuckled and 
slapped his belly. 

The secretary tore wrappers off 
two tumblers and clinked ice into 
them. His rabbit face with its spec- 
tacles framed in clear plsistic ex- 
pressed a rabbity concern. 

“It ain’t for laughs, Sam,” he 
said. “It’s like the dancing mania 
of the Middle Ages, ever hear of 
it?” 

“No. D’they string up dogs by a 

53 




hind leg too?” 

“No, only danced. But it was 
catcliing, like this is. My God, Sam, 
it’s all over the state now, U.D.D, 
women running in packs at night, 
singing, hanging up every dog they 
can catch. Sam, it scares me.” 

He splashed whisky into the two 
glasses. The adjutant belched, sat 
up in a creaking of bed springs, 
and scratched his heavy jaw. 

“You’re thinking they might 
start hanging up us poor sons of 
bitches, ain’t you?” he asked. “Hell, 
call out the Guard. Clamp on a 
curfew.” He reached for a glass. 

“Yes, and the Russians’ll fake 
pictures of your boys sticking old 
women with bayonets,” the secre- 
tary said. “Governor Bob couldn’t 
get reelected as dogcatcher, even.” 
The adjutant drained his glass, 
lipping back the ice, and whistled 
his breath out through pouting lips. 

''Good! Needed that,” he 
grunted. “Dave, Bob’s got that 
Stonery dame by the short hairs, 
he’ll swing her into line. Just that 
about her boy in the state pen out 
in California is enough. Brown 
would do Bob a favor and spring 
him. Or the papers here would 
splash it. Either way.” 

“I know, I know,” the secretary 
said, sipping at his drink. “We’ll 
see, when Bob gets here. Mean- 
while, as of yesterday we had 
thirty-three thousand seven hun- 
dred twenty-six dogs in protec- 
tive custody and God knows how 
many more under house arrest. 
Sixteen thousand bucks a day it’s 
costing us — ” 

He broke off as a knock sounded 
on the door. He hastily tore the 

54 



wrapper off another glass and 
splashed it full of ice and bourbon. 
The adjutant padded to the door 
and opened it. The governor, a 
stout, florid man in a gray sports 
coat, came in and sat stiffly on the 
edge of the bed. The secretary 
handed him the drink and he 
gulped half of it before speaking. 

“No smoke, boys,” he said final- 
ly. “She give it to me just like she 
does to the papers. We got to go 
to the moon, or make the Russians 
do it, and bring that poor, dear, 
sweet, trusting, cuddly little dog 
back to Earth again.” 

“How about her kid out on the 
coast?” the adjutant asked. 

“She spit in my eye, Sam. Said 
she was just as brave to be a martyr 
as the dogs they string up. Why, she 
even told me about another boy of 
hers, living in sin with a black 
woman down in Cuba, and dared 
me to give that to the papers too.” 

“She sounds tough as she looks.” 

“She’s tougher,” the governor 
groaned. “Like blue granite. I felt 
like I was back in the third grade.” 
He handed his empty glass to the 
secretary. 

“What did you finally do?” the 
secretary asked. 

“What the hell could I do? I 
want that U.D.D. vote, it must be 
a whopper. I wagged my tail and 
barked for her and said I had 
an idea.” 

“And now I got to think up the 
idea,” the secretary said, still hold- 
ing the empty glass. 

“No, I thought it up on my way 
back,” the governor said. “I’m go- 
ing to fly to Washington this after- 
noon.” 



RICHARD McKENNA 




“Not the army, for Gkxl’s sake,” 
pleaded the adjutant. 

“No, Tm going to dump it on the 
Russian embassy. Damn their black 
hearts, they started this. Hurry up 
with that drink!” 

“Watch out you don’t lose your 
donkey for sure and all,” the ad- 
jutant said. “Them Russians are 
smart cookies.” 

“They’ll have to be,” the gover- 
nor said, reaching for the fresli 
drink. “They sure . as . hell 
. will have to be!” 



A ll the folding chairs were 
L taken. Extra women stood in 
the aisles and along the side of 
the hall. Martha Stonery bulged 
over the rostrum in blue knitted* 
wool and a pearl necklace. Seated 
around a half-circle of chairs be- 
hind her, pack leaders and com- 
mittee chairwomen smoothed at 
their skirts. Monica Flint in dove 
gray sat at the organ. 

Martha pounded with her gavel 
so hard that her pearls rattled. 

“Everyone will please stand 
while we sing our hymn,” she said 
into the resultant hush. She nodded 
to Monica, who began to play. 

“/ did not raise my dog to ride a 
sputnik, I will not let him wander 
to the moon, . The song was a 
shrill thundering. 

Martha beamed across her bosom 
as the crowd settled itself again. 

“I have a most thrilling an- 
nouncement to make before we ad- 
journ, girls,” she said, “but first we 
will have committee reports. Paula 
Hart, will you begin?” She yielded 
the rostrum. 



All the reports were favorable. 
The U.D.D. was getting four times 
as many column-inches in the state 
press as the Russian moonship. It 
was on TV and radio. A Life team 
was coming. 

Changes were recommended. 
Vigilante packs were not to carry 
hat pins any more. Two policemen 
had lost eyes and the police were 
being ugly about it. A bar of soap in 
a man’s sock was to be substituted. 
More practice on the clove hitch 
was needed. Too often, in their ex- 
citement, the pack ladies were only 
putting two half hitches around the 
leg and the dog could struggle out 
of it 

Martha came back to the rostrum 
to read the honor roll of those 
whom dogs had bitten or policemen 
had insulted. Each heroine came 
forward amid cheers and clapping 
to receive a certificate exchange- 
able for the Bleeding Heart medal 
as soon as the honors committee 
could agree on a design and have a 
supply made up. Martha shook the 
hands, some of them bandaged, and 
wept a few tears. 

“And now, fellow U.D.D. mem- 
bers,” she said, “I will tell you ray 
surprise. Tomorrow morning I have 
an appointment with someone com- 
ing from Washington!” 

A sighing murmur swept through 
the hdl. 

“No, not Eisenhower/^ Martha 
said scornfully. “A man from the 
Russian embassy, a Mr. Cher- 
kassov.” 

Applause crashed shrilly. Women 
wept and hugged each other. 

“They want to make peace,” 
Martha shouted ringingly into tlie 



LOVE AND MOONDOGS 



55 




tumult. “WeVe won, girls! Sally 
out tonight and don’t come in until 
the last dog is hung! We’ll show 
them what it means to challenge 
the massed U.D.D.-ers of Amer- 
ica!” 

The state police cordon kept the 
2200 block of Euclid Avenue free of 
reporters and idle gapers. The state 
car drove up at 10:00 a.m. and 
parked under the oak tree. Mr. 
Cherkassov and the two TASS men 
got out. 

Mr. Cherkassov was stocky and 
crop-haired in a blue suit. His 
broad, high-cheekboned face, with 
snub nose and an inward tilt about 
the eyes, managed to seem both 
alert and impassive. Carrying a pig- 
skin briefcase, he led the way to the 
Stonery front door. 

He stepped on the doormat and 
pressed the bell. The doormat 
whirred and writhed under his feet 
and he stepped back hastily. Martha 
Stonery, regal in maroon silk, four- 
inch cameo and piled gray hair, 
opened the door. 

“Don’t be afraid of the doormat, 
Mr. Cherkassov — you are Mr. 
Cherkassov, aren’t you?” she asked 
sweetly. 

He nodded, looking from her to 
the doormat. 

“Your weight presses something 
and the little brushes spin around 
and clean your shoes,” she ex- 
plained. “I expect you don’t have 
things like that in Russia. But do, 
please, come in and sit down.” 

The three men stepped carefully 
across the mat on entering. In the 
oak-paneled living room, Paula 
Hart waited in black wool and 

56 



pearls with Monica Flint, who wore 
white jade and green jersey. Martha 
and Mr. Cherkassov made intro- 
ductions back and forth and the 
men bowed stiffly. Then Martha sat 
down flanked by her aides on the 
gray sofa facing the picture window. 
The men sat in single chairs and 
rubbed their polished black shoes 
uneasily against the deep-pile gray 
rug. 

“Madame Stonery, I have come 
to justify moondog,” Mr. Cherkas- 
sov said. His voice was deep and 
controlled. 

“Two wrongs don’t make a right, 
Mr. Cherkassov,” Martha said, rais- 
ing her head. “You needn’t bring 
up Hiroshima. We already know 
about those thousands of little black 
^nd white spaniels. Besides, I saw a 
Life picture where you sewed a little 
dog’s head to the side of a big dog’s 
neck.” 

Mr. Cherkassov looked at his 
stubby fingers and hid them under 
his briefcase. Paula and Monica 
nodded accusingly and one TASS 
man made a note. 

“We do not believe it is a wrong 
when a greater value prevails over 
a lesser,” Mr. Cherkassov said. 
“Moondog sends us information 
that will hasten the time of safe 
space- travel for humans.” 

“And who might you be, to say 
which value is greatest? Space 
travel is moonshine, just moon- 
shine 

“I do not understand your word, 
madame. If you mean impossible, 
I must point out that moondog has 
already crossed space.” 

Martha clasped her hands in her 
lap. “That’s what 1 mean, grown 

RICHARD McKENNA 




men and such silliness, and the poor 
little dog has to pay.” 

Mr. Gherkassov spoke earnestly. 
“Forgive me if my ignorance of 
your language causes me to misun- 
derstand, madame. We believe be- 
cause man now has the ability to 
cross space he therefore has a duty 
to all life on Earth to help it reach 
other planets. Earth is overcrowded 
with men, not to speak of the wild 
life that soon must all die. We be- 
lieve that around other suns we will 
find Earth-like planets where we 
can plough and harvest and build 
homes. I cannot agree that it is 
silly.” 

Martha flung her head back. 
“Well, it is silly. Who’ll go? All 
the men who do things will run 
away to them and then where will 
we be? Oh no, Mr. Gherkassov, 
that gets you nowhere!” 

“Your pardon, madame,” a 
TASS man interrupted. “What 
kind of men will run away?” 

“The sour-faced men who fix 
pipes and TV and make A-bombs 
and electricity and things.” 

“Oh,” said Mr. Gherkassov. He 
drummed on liis briefcase. Then, 
“Perhaps only Russians will go, 
madame. You could pass a law. I 
must confess to you, we might have 
sent a man to the moon, but we 
feared the propaganda use your 
country might make of it.” 

Martha made her parrot mouth. 
“You should have sent a man.'” 
She chomped the last word off 
short. Paula and Monica nodded 
vigorously. 

Mr. Gherka;ssov stroked his brief- 
case. “Moondog’s mistress wished 
greatly to go. One might say moon- 

LOVE AND MOONDOGS 



dog saved her mistress’ life. Is not 
that a value to you?” 

Martha stared. “Did you dare 
think of sending a poor weak wom- 
an to the ... to the moon?^^ 

“Russian women are coarse and 
strong,” Mr. Gherkassov said sooth- 
ingly. “A large number of them, 
among the scientists, did volunteer.” 

M artha sat bolt upright and 
made her parrot beak again. 
Her fat cheeks flushed under the 
powder. 

“No!” she snapped. “I see where 
you’re trying to lead me and I won’t 
go! You should have sent the hussy! 
It is immoral to sacrifice a loving 
little dog just for a careless whim.” 
Her two aides gazed admiringly 
at their chief tainess. “Tliink of it, 
just for a whim!” Paula echoed. 

Mr. Gherkassov’s fingers traced 
an aimless, intricate pattern on the 
briefcase and he crossed his ankles. 

“All dogs are not loving in the 
same way, madame. Tell me, how 
do you know when a dog loves 
you?” 

“You just know,” Martha said. 
“Take my little Fiffalo — and I just 
know he’s so miserable now away 
from me in that dreadful concentra- 
tion camp and it’s all your fault, 
really, Mr. Gherkassov — when I pet 
Fiffalo he jumps in my lap and 
kisses me and just wiggles all over. 
That’s real love!” 

“Ah ... I perhaps understand. 
What does he do when you speak 
sharply to him?” 

“He lies on his back with his paws 
waving and looks so sad and pitiful 
and defenseless that my heart melts 

57 




and I feel good all over. You just 
know that’s love, when it happens 
to you.” 

Monica dabbed at a tear. Both 
TASS men scribbled. 

‘T think I may see a way to re- 
solve our differences,” Mr. Cher- 
kassov said. He put his feet side 
by side and leaned slightly forward, 
gripping the briefcase on his knees. 

“What do you know of the histoi7 
of the dog?” he asked. 

“Well, he’s always been man’s 
best friend and the savage Indians 
used to eat him and . and. 

“The true dog, madame, was 
domesticated about twenty thou- 
sand years ago. He was originally 
the golden jackal, Canis aureus, 
which still exists in a wild state. 
Selective breeding for submissive- 
ness and obedience over that long 
time has resulted in the retention 
through maturity of many traits 
nonnal only to puppyhood. The 
modern pureline golden jackal dog 
no longer develops a secret life of 
his own, with emotional self-suffi- 
ciency. He must love and be loved, 
or he dies.” 

Monica sniffed. “What a beauti- 
ful name,” Paula murmured. Mar- 
tha nodded warily. 

“But, madame, there is also a 
kind of false dog. Certain Siberian 
tribes slow to reach civilized status 
also domesticated the northern wolf. 
Canis lupus. This was many thou- 
sands of years later, of course, and 
in the false dog the effect of long 
breeding is not so evident. He is 
loving as a puppy, but when he ma- 
tures he is aloof and reserves his 
loyalty to one master. He is intense- 
ly loyal and will die for his master,

but even to him he will display little 
outward affection. Perhaps a wag of 
the tail or a head laid on the knee, 
not too often. No others except 
quite young children may pet him 
at all. To all but his master he dis- 
plays a kind of tolerant indifference 
unless he is molested, and then he 
defends himself.” 

“What a horrible creature, not a 
dog at all!” Martha exclaimed. 

“Not culturally, you arc quite 
correct, madame,” Mr. Cherkassov 
agreed, shifting his hold on the 
briefcase and leaning further for- 
ward, “but unfortunately he is a dog 
biologically. Some wolf blood has 
crept into most of the jackal-derived 
breeds, you know. It betrays itself 
in high cheekbones and slanting 
eyes and in the personality of the 
breed. The chow, for instance, has 
considerable wolf blood.” 

“Chows!” Martha beaked her 
lips again. “I despise them! No bet- 
ter than cats!” Paula nodded em- 
phatic agreement. 

“But your little Fiffalo, as you 
describe him, is probably of pure 
Canis aureus descent and very high- 
ly bred.” 

“I’m sure he is. Blood will tell. 
Monica, haven’t I always said blood 
will tell?” 

Monica nodded, her eyes shining. 
Mr. Cherkassov shifted his position 
slightly, nearer to the chair edge. 

“Now moondog, Madame Ston- 
ery, is of the lajka breed and has 
even more wolf blood than the 
chow. If you brought her back to 
Earth she would just walk away 
from you with cold indifference.” 

“Not re ally?'' 

“Madame, you know the wolf 
RICHARD McKENNA 




traits only as you find them tem- 
pered with the loving jackal traits 
in such dogs as the chow. But a 
Russian dog! If you were to hand 
moondog a piece of meat, do you 
know what she would do?” 

“No. Tell me.” 

Mr. Cherkassov leaned forward, 
his slanting gray eyes opening wide, 
and dropped his voice almost to a 
whisper. “Madame, she would bite 
your hand!” 

“Then she doesn’t deserve to be 
rescued!” Martha said sharply. 

Mr. Cherkassov straightened up 
and began stroking his briefcase. 
“In one sense she is not even a dog,” 
he suggested. 

“No, she’s an old wolf-thing. Like 
a cat. Dogs are loving!^^ 

“Perhaps not morally worthy of 
your campaign?” 

“No, of course not. Mr. Cherkas- 
sov, you have given me a new 
thought ... I hadn’t realized. .” 
Mr. Cherkassov waited attentive- 
ly, his fingers tracing another pat- 
tern. Paula and Monica looked at 
Martha and held their breaths. 

“. hadn’t realized how that 
subversive wolf blood has been 
creeping into our loving dogs all 
this long time. Why . why it’s 
miscegenation! It’s bestiality! Con- 
fess it, Mr. Cherkassov — that’s one 
way you Russians have been in- 
filtrating us, now isn’t it?” 



Mr. Cherkassov raised his sandy 
eyebrows, and a frosty twinkle shone 
in his tilted eyes. 

“You must realize that I could 
hardly admit to such a thing, even 
if it were true, Madame Stonery,” 
he said judiciously. 

“It is true! Go back to your 
Kremlin, Mr. Cherkassov, and 
shoot every wolf in Russia to the 
moon. I’m sure the U.D.D. won’t 
mind!” 

Mr. Cherkassov and the TASS 
men stood up and bowed. Martha 
rose and sailed ahead of them to 
the door. Hand on knob, she turned 
to face them. 

“Our meeting will be historic, 
Mr. Cherkassov,” she said. “I have 
forced you to betray your country’s 
plot to undermine our loving dogs. 
You may expect from the U.D.D. 
instant and massive retaliation! An 
aroused America will move at once, 
to set up miscegenation and segre- 
gation barriers against your despic- 
able wolf blood!” 

Paula and Monica stood up, each 
with her hands clasped under her 
flushed and excited face. Mr. Cher- 
kassov bowed again. Martha opened 
the door. 

“Goodbye, Mr. Cherkassov,” she 
said. “You will, no doubt, be liqui- 
dated in a few days.” 

Mr. Cherkassov stepped carefully 
across the doormat. END

The Last Days of L.A. 



Murder on a small scale may be illegal 



and unpleasant, but mass murder can be 



the most exhilarating thing in the world! 



BY GEORGE H. SMITH 



OU ARE HAVING the same 
recurring dream, the dream 
that has haunted the whole world 
since that day in 1945. The dream 
of the sudden flash in the night, the 
rising mushroom cloud and then 
annihilation. You are living the 
nightmare again but this time it’s 
true, you know it’s true. You can’t 
be dreaming. The bombs are ac- 
tually falling and huge fireballs are 
sweeping upward while seas of 
flame spread at supersonic speeds 
to engulf the city. You feel the blast, 
the searing heat, you feel your flesh 
melting away. You try to scream 
but the sound dies in your throat as 
your lungs shrivel. Horror makes 
you try again and somehow you 



do scream and wake yourself up. 

Once m6re, this one more time, it 
is only a dream. You lie there pant- 
ing, too weak from terror to move 
out of the puddle of your own 
sweat. You lie there and think and 
your thoughts aren’t very pretty. It’s 
a week day and you ought to be 
down at the office turning out ad- 
vertising copy by the ton but instead 
you lie there and think even though 
you don’t like what you’re thinking. 
It’s got to be soon. It can’t be much 
longer now, not the way things arc 
going. 

You finally crawl out of bed 
around noon and ease your way into 
the kitchen. You realize that you 
have a hangover and since you can’t 




60 





remember what you did the night 
before you suppose you must have 
been drunk. By the time you finish 
one of the two quarts of beer you 
find in the refrigerator you know 
that isn’t what you need, so you put 
on some clothes and wander out to 
a bar. 

After a few quick drinks you walk 
somewhat unsteadily out into the 
street again and head toward the 
place you always think of as The 



Bar. A wino edges up to you and 
asks for money to buy a sandwich 
and a cup of coffee. 

You give him a dollar but make 
him promise not to spend it on any- 
thing so foolish as food. “Liquor, 
brother, is the salvation of the 
race,” you tell him. “Believe and 
be saved!” 

“Amen!” he says and hurnes off. 

You make the mistake of stop- 
ping to read the headlines on the 



61 





comer so you know you’re not 
drunk enough yet. U. S. REJECTS ' 
NEW RUSS NOTE. MOON 
GUNS GAN DESTROY CITIES: 
KAGANOVITCH. BURMA 
LEADER KILLED IN FRESH 
UPRISING. 

Just before you get to The Bar 
you pass an alleyway and as you 
glance into the darkness, you see a 
huge rat standing there staring at 
you with arrogant red eyes. After a 
moment he walks away, unhurried 
and cocky. An icy chill runs down 
your spine. The rats will survive. 
The rats always survive. Maybe 
they are the Master Race. Some- 
thing else tugs at your memory, 
something you read somewhere. Oh 
yes, it was a statement by an ocea- 
nographer. He said that even if the 
H-bomb should annihilate every liv- 
ing thing on the surface of the 
earth, the sea creatures would be 
able to carry on. The rats and the 
fish will carry on and build a better 
world. 

Your friends are sitting in their 
usual places when you get to The 
Bar. John Jones-Very who has the 
reddest, bushiest and longest beard 
and also the record for staying 
drunk the longest, is doing the talk- 
ing. Listening are Dale Bushman 
who paints huge canvases which he 
never finishes, Ian, an out-of-work 
musician whose last name you don’t 
know, Pat O’Malley the actor and, 
of course, Anna. 

Anna is small and thin with deej> 
ly tanned skin drawn tightly over 
high cheekbones. She wears a plain 
dress and no makeup and her hair 
is done up in a bun on the nape of 
neck. The poetry she writes is a 

3 ? 



kind of elegant pornography. She 
is the only one in the group who 
makes any money and that is be- 
cause her book FLAME ROSE has 
been banned all across the country. 
You like her very much, probably 
because she is the most irritatingly 
ugly woman you have ever met. 

A howling bank of jets hurls 
across the sky screaming for human 
blood and you shiver as you squeeze 
in at the table. You are convinced 
that the elementals of hell are loose 
above and the world is in its last 
stages. All the children bom this 
year will probably have twenty-one 
teeth and Anti-Christ will walk the 
land. 

“Why worry about the next 
war?” Dale Bushman asks. “It 
won’t last forever.” 

“No,” John says. “No war ever 
has . yet.” 

“Do you think it’s coming?” you 
ask. 

“If you read the papers, you’d 
take to the hills right now,” Pat 
O’Malley says, finishing his bowl of 
chili and reaching for his drink. 

“Ah, the hills,” Ian says. “But 
what good? The H-bomb is bad 
enough but they’ll use the G-bomb, 
the cobalt bomb, and this is the 
final weapon.” 

“Just the same,” you say. “I think 
we ought to take to the hills.” Why 
not hide yourself way back of no- 
where? Hide so deep in the woods 
and mountains that you won’t even 
know when it happens. You could 
wrap the silence around you and 
pull the earth over you. You could 
bury yourself so deep that . but 
of course you won’t. You have a job 
and, like everyone else, at least a

thousand other reasons for staying 
on until the end. 

“But really, “ you say, “a man 
should be able to survive a time of 
terror by disengaging himself as 
complcicly as possible from the rest 
of the human race. If he were to 
reduce his needs to a minimum . 
a little bread, a few vegetables, a 
blanket or two, a warm cave 
and . 

“A blonde or two,” Pat says. 

Bushman adds, “A cellar of good 
Scotch.” 

“And books, lots of books,” Jones- 
Very puts in. 

“No blondes, no Scotch, no 
books,” you tell them, banging your 
mug on the table so hard their 
glasses jump. “Minimum needs . 
minimum needs!” 

“How about plumbing?” Anna 
demands. “I won’t go without 
plumbing.” 

“We’re facing the end of the 
world,” says John, “and you worry 
about plumbing!” 

“I’m sorry, but if plumbing isn’t 
going to survive. I’d just as soon 
not either,” Anna says. “I just can’t 
see myself squatting in the bushes.” 

“What difference does it make?” 
Ian asks. “Everybody dies anyway. 
From the moment you’re born, you 
start dying.” 

“Yes, but—” 

“So why bother? Everybody dies. 
Why prolong it more than you have 
to? Everybody dies.” 

“Worlds may or may not blow 
up,” O’Malley says, “but it seems to 
me it’s the little indignities of 
modern life that hurt the most. The 
constant repetition of the advertis- 
ing slogans that insult your intelli- 

THE LAST DAYS OF L.A. 



gence, and the women with the 
pearly teeth and perfect permanent 
waves, without body odor or souls.” 
“I have body odor,” Anna says. 
“But no soul,” Ian says. “No soul 
at all.” 

“You’re just mad because I 
wouldn’t sleep with you last night.” 
“No soul,” Ian says. 

The jukebo-x offers Tin Pan 
Alley’s solution to the whole thing: 

OH BABY, OH MY BABY O 
MY BABY IS MY BABY O 
MY BABY IS MY BABY O 
MY BABY LOVES ME O 
SHE DOES, SHE DOES, SHE 
DOES O 

“Our trouble is too much his- 
tory,” John says. “A period without 
history is a happy one and we’ve 
had too much history.” 

“No soul — too much history,” 
Ian hiccups. “Not enough sex- 
everybody dies.” 

“Everybody is going to die damr 
fast, unless something happens,” 
you say. 

“No soul — so sad,” Ian mumbles. 
No soul and no sex . everybody 
dies, nothing happens.” 

“So what?” Anna demands. 
“What is life anyway? Why try to 
be like everyone else in this beauti- 
ful but messy Brave New World of 
1970? Why run searching for a 
messiah when all the messiahs died 
a thousand years ago?” 

This starts you thinking about 
religion. You’ve never thought 
much about it before but a man 
can change, maybe even accept the 
old myths as real until they actually 
begin to seem real. Instead of dwel- 

63 




ling on your body being burned to a 
cinder in an atomic holocaust you 
could think of your slightly singed 
soul being wafted to paradise on a 
mushroom cloud while U-235 atoms 
sing a heavenly chorus to speed you 
on your way. 

The others don’t even notice 
when you get up and walk out to 
look for a church. 



HURCHES AREN’T hard to 
find in Los Angeles on any day 
of the week or at any hour of the 
day. They’re behind the blank 
fronts of painted-over store win- 
dows. They’re located in big old 
nineteenth-century houses along 
Adams; they spring up under tents 
in vacant lots and in large expen- 
sive temples and bank-like buildings 
in the downtown area. 

You pass by several likely-looking 
churches because they are in neigh- 
borhoods that have alleyways, and 
you still remember that rat, that 
red-eyed rat. 

Then as you walk through down- 
town crowds, you remember some- 
thing else. Some dentist once said 
that the teeth of the people in the 
A-bombed Japanese cities hadn’t 
been affected by radiation. This is 
very funny, it makes you laugh. You 
picture a world of blistered corpses, 
none of whose teeth have been 
affected. You laugh out loud and 
people turn to look at you. 

A woman points you out to a 
policeman and he looks your way. 
You want to keep on laughing but 
now you don’t dare to. So you just 
keep on walking, trying to keep the 
laughter from bubbling out of you. 



“Hey, bud,” the policeman calls 
to you, “what’s the matter with 
you?” 

“Nothing — nothing at all, offi- 
cer,” you tell him, and dive into the 
next church you pass. 

This one is called the Church of 
the New Cosmology. Inside, a 
round-faced little man is talking to 
a few listless people. 

“A geologist will never know the 
rocks until he has seen the Rock of 
Ages. The botanist will never know 
plants until he has beheld the Lily 
of the Valley, the cosmologist will 
never know the universe until he 
has listened to the Word of God ! 

“Let us consider for a moment 
the sun. What do wc know about 
the sun, my friends? What do the 
so-called scientists know about it? 
What do they tell us about our 
heavenly light? They say it’s a giant 
ball of fire millions of miles across 
and ninety-one million miles away. 
Now why, I ask you, would that be 
so? The Bible says that God made 
the sun to light the world. Now 
have you ever known the Lord to 
do anything silly or foolish? Of 
course you haven’t! Then why do 
they ask us to believe that He would 
put the sun, which is supposed to 
light the world, ninety-one million 
miles away from it? An engineer 
who did something like that 
wouldn’t be much of a God. The 
true answer, my friends, is that 
Jehovah God did nothing so im- 
practical and no matter who tells 
you different, don’t believe it!” 

The little man’s voice dropped to 
a husky whisper. “I have studied 
my Bible and I’ve listened to the 
scientists and I’ve talked to God 




64 



GEORGE H. SMITH 




Himself about it and I tell you this 
is the truth. The sun is our heavenly 
light, the sure sign of God’s love, 
and right this minute it is just two 
thousand three hundred miles from 
Los Angeles! It is not a wasteful 
million miles across, it is just forty- 
five and five-tenths miles across . 
just the right size to give us our 
beautiful California sunshine. 

“How do I know?” The whisper 
had grown lo a hoarse shout. “How 
do I know? I know because it’s the 
Word of God, my friends! The per- 
sonal word of God given to me by 
God Himself. 

“What else do I know? What else 
has God told me, to confound the 
Godless scientists? Why, my friends, 
the Bible says that this earth upon 
which we live is flat — as flat as this 
book!” He brings his hand down 
with a sharp slap on the Bible. “You 
ask then how is it possible to cir- 
cumnavigate the world when it is a 
flat plane. The answer is that it 
isn’t possible. A ship that seems to 
go around the world really makes a 
circle on the flat surface like this.” 
With a stubby forefinger he draws a 
circle on the book. “Now I know 
that those scientists up on the moon 
say that the world is round, but 
whoever saw or heard of a scientist 
that wasn’t a liar? Can any of you 
really bring yourselves to believe 
that this flat earth of ours is travel- 
ing through space at the tremen- 
dous speed that they say it is? Tell 
me, d6 you feel any wind from this 
great speed? Do you feel anything 
at all?” 

No, you have to admit, you don’t. 
You don’t feel a thing. Even his 
own congregation doesn’t seem to. 

THE LAST DAYS OF L.A. 



This is thirsty work. You have a 
couple more drinks and then you 
look for another church. You find 
one called the Church of Christian 
Capitalism. 

The thin old man with the dusty 
fringe of gray hair has his audience 
well in hand as you walk in and 
take a seat. He makes the sign of 
the cross and the sign of the dollar 
over their heads as he harangues 
them. 

“Blessed are the wealthy for they 
shall please God,” he says. “Christ 
was the first capitalist, dear friends. 
He took a loaf and seven fishes and 
blessed them and made them into 
enough food to feed a multitude. 
He walked in poverty but he came 
to own the world! 

“God is the Good Capitalist, the 
Owner and Proprietor of all things 
on this earth. This country was 
created by those saints of Capital- 
ism — Morgan, Rockefeller and 
Gould.” 

Christian Capitalism sends you 
home to bed by way of another bar. 

OU’RE SITTING in a room 
with people all around you. At 
first you don’t know why you’re 
there and then you remember it’s 
a party. Everyone except you is 
laughing and drinking and having 
a good time. You have a strange 
sense of foreboding, of something 
about to happen that you can’t 
avoid. You see a girl you know 
across the room and get up and 
start to cross the room to her. 

There’s a sudden blinding flash 
of light outside the house and the 
windows come crashing in. You see 




65 




•murderous slivers of glass piercing 
the flesh of those about you and you 
hurry over to the girl you know only 
to find her face and neck slashed 
by the flying glass and blood stream- 
ing down over her bare breasts. You 
try to stop the flow of blood with a 
handkerchief but it’s coming in such 
strong spurts that you can’t. 

A second shock wave follows the 
first with an even brighter flash. 
You’re knocked to the floor and the 
building comes crashing down. You 
struggle against the falling masonry 
but it does no good. You feel the 
crushing weight and scream . and 
your screams wake you up. 

You feel almost as bad awake as 
you did asleep, only now the crush- 
ing weight is on your head instead 
of your chest and your mouth is 
filled with the taste of death and 
decay. You figure you must have 
been drinking last night but you 
can’t quite remember. 

You reach out your hand and it 
locates a bottle that still guggles a 
little. Without opening your eyes 
you lift it hurriedly to your mouth 
and then almost choke trying to spit 
it out. Mouthwash! 

You manage to get your eyes 
open, and remember with thankful 
heart that today is Sunday and you 
don’t have to go to work. It’s been 
five days since the last dream and 
that’s not so bad, but just the same 
you’d better get up and get a drink 
because this one really shook you 
up. Or maybe you ought to go to 
church. Perhaps you’d better do 
both. 

A tall blond man in a black suit 
is standing on a platform in the 
center of a group of forty or fifty 



intensely quiet people as you enter. 

‘‘Is there a wall in front of you?” 
he asks. 

“Yes, there is a wall in front of 
us,” the people answer. 

“Gan you see the wall in front of 
you?” 

“Yes, we can see the wall.” 

“Is there a wall behind you?” 

“Yes, there is a wall behind us.” 

“Gan you see the wall behind 
you?” 

They all turn around and look. 
“Yes, we can see the wall behind 
us.” 

“Is there a floor beneath your 
feet?” 

“Yes, there is a floor beneath our 
feet.” 

“Are you sure? Feel the floor 
with your feet.” 

There is a loud shuffling as they 
do as they are told. 

“Are you sure the floor is there?” 

“Yes, we’re sure the floor is 
there.” 

“Now feel your feet with the 
floor.” 

There is more shuffling and dur- 
ing this you steal quietly out. This 
one reminds you of the D.T.’s and 
you want nothing at all to do with 
that. 

You get tossed out of the next 
place you try because the preacher 
says you’re drunk. You’re not, but 
you wish you were, so you head to- 
ward The Bar. You stop when you 
see the sign, ‘ FLYING SAUGER 
GONVENTION.” It’s over the 
door of a large building and under- 
neath in smaller letters it says, “Lis- 
ten to the words of the Space Peo- 
ple. Hear the advice they bring us 
in these troubled times.” 



66 



GEORGE H. SMITH 




Surely, you tell yourself, the 
Space People will have a solution, 
surely they can bring peace. You 
enter and see a young, ordinary- 
looking follow addressing a crowd of 
about three hundred. You take a 
seat next to a bald man who is 
writing down what the young man 
is saying even though it doesn’t 
seem to make much sense. 

'*. member of a small group 
that has been in touch with the 
Space People and feel that this 
world can be saved only through the 
aid of superior beings. I will now 
play this tape which I obtained 
Irom the captain of a Flying 
Saucer.” 

He places the tape orr the spindle 
and it begins to whirl. A/voice be- 
gins to speak in slightly stilted 
English. “I am Lelan. I am what 
you people of Earth think of as the 
liead of the government of the 
planet Nobila. 1 speak to you across 
the parsecs in order to bring you 
good and bad news. The good is 
that a new age is about to begin for 
the people of Earth through the aid 
of we Nobilians. We have already 
contacted the President of the 
United States, the Pope of the 
Catholic Church and all other 
world leaders. A new age is about 
to begin for you as soon as we have 
saved you from the evil influence 
of the vicious Zenonians from the 
planet Zeno. All Earth knowledge 
will become obsolete as we supply 
you with new information and all 
good things will be free in the days 
after we drive the Zenonians from 
among you. 

“But first we must warn you that 
the Zenonians will try to stop us, 

THE LAST DAYS OF LA. 



but you can help avoid this if you 
are alert. Look around you for per- 
sons who seem strange. It is the 
Zenonians who have made you 
what you are. It is the Zenonians 
who cause your wars and your 
crime with their evil rays. We will 
use our good Nobil rays to combat 
their evil Z rays. When we have 
driven them out, the world will be a 
better place in which to live. But — 
beware! They are all about you. 
Examine the man next to you. Be- 
ware! They are all about you. You 
shall hear from us again.” 

You turn and look at the man 
next to you; he’s looking at you. 
He is a rather strange- looking guy 
and you edge away from him just 
as he edges away from you. You 
turn to look at the man on the other 
side of you. He is moving away 
from you also. 

rhen you hear the stories of the 
people in the audience. Every one 
of them who stands up to speak has 
had a mysterious visitor in the night 
or had a flying saucer land in his 
backyard. Most of them have had 
trips to the moon and elsewhere in 
flying saucers. Space you think must 
be as crowded as the Hollywood 
Freeway at rush hour. Almost all 
of them have been contacted by 
superior beings from space because 
they are the only people in the 
world who are wise enough to in- 
terpret the Space People to the 
Earth people. 

You feel pretty good from the 
drinks you’ve had, so you stand up 
and tell them what you think. 

“The first flying saucers were 
sighted after the atomic bombs were 
first exploded,” you begin. “And 



67 




they became very prevalent after 
the first Earth satellites were put 
into space and again after the first 
moon rockets. I therefore think that 
the Earth is a cosmic madhouse in 
which the human race has been in- 
carcerated for its own good and 
that every time we start rattling the 
bars, the keepers hurry down to take 
a looL” 

No one seems to care much for 
your theory, and you are escorted 
to the door none too politely. 

No, the Space People don’t seem 
to have the answer. With the head- 
lines you see at every corner chasing 
you, you head for The Bar and 
dive gratefully through the door. 

“So everybody dies,” Ian is say- 
ing. “We’re all dying, just sitting 
here.” 

“Will you stop that? God damn 
it, will you stop that?” you yell at 
him. 

Ian looks at you owlishly for a 
few seconds and then back at his 
drink. Jones-Very and the others go 
right on with the conversation. 

“It’s merely what I was saying 
the other night,” Jones-Very says. 
“It’s the contagious spread of the 
madness that is epidemic in our 
time. No one wants war. But still 
we are going to have a war. After 
all, the very Zeitgeist of our times is 
one of complete callousness toward 
human life. You have only to think 
of the Russian slave camps, the 
German gas chambers and our own 
highway slaughter.” 

“Maybe hfe itself is just some sort 
of stupid mistake,” Anna says. 
“Maybe we’re a cosmic blunder, a 
few pimples on the tail of the uni- 
verse.” 



“That isn’t so,” you blurt out. 
“There’s purpose — there’s got to be 
purpose. You can’t look around you 
and say there isn’t purpose in the 
universe; that there isn’t a reason 
for our being here.” 

This time they all turn and look 
at you strangely. Then they look at 
each other. 

“I wonder,” Jones- Very says, “if 
I wasn’t closer to the truth than I 
thought when I talked about con- 
tagion.” 

“What the hell do you mean by 
that?” you demand, half rising from 
your seat. 

“Nothing . nothing at all,” 
Jones- Very says, looking at the 
others. 

“What this world needs is a moral 
renovation — a new birth of the 
spirit,” you go on. 

“Oh, my God,” Jones-Very 
moans, his head in his hands. 

“Would you listen to that, in this 
age of space stations and moon 
guns,” Anna says. 

“John, you’re right — you’re 
right! It’s got him!” Bushman says. 

You won’t listen to any more of 
this. You get to your feet and stag- 
ger with great dignity to the door. 

Y OU’RE DRESSED in high 
altitude equipment and you’re 
sitting in the nose of a jet bomber 
listening to the vicious growling of 
the motors. You have a tremendous 
feeling of power and you think 
about how many you’ll kill this trip. 
You think about the big black 
bombs nestled in the bomb bay and 
remember there is one for each of 
the three cities on your list.

Gcxl, it will be beautiful! You can 
almost see the glorious colors of the 
rising mushroom cloud and hear the 
screaming of the shattered atoms. 
You can’t hear the screaming of the 
people up here, that’s one of the 
nicest parts of this kind of murder. 
You can’t hear them. This makes 
you as happy at it must have made 
Aitila and Hitler when they killed 
their millions. Murder on a small 
scale may be illegal and unpleasant, 
but mass murder can be the most 
exhilarating thing in the world. 

Then your bombs are gone and 
you’re passing through the most 
beautiful clouds you’ve ever seen 
but somehow they smell of charred 
flesh and even up here you hear the 
screams of the people. The sound 
rips and tears at your brain, destroy- 
ing what little sanity you have left. 
You’ve got to stop them! You've 
got to, before they drive you com- 
pletely mad. You tilt the nose of 
the bomber and dive toward the 
screams. You’ve got to stop them! 
You scream back at them as you 
dive and again your own screams 
wake you up. 

This is the worst one you’ve ever 
had and your hangover is almost as 
bad. You dress and hurry out of 
your ap4.rtment to get away from 
the terror and the guilt but sudden- 
ly you remember that you aren’t 
really the guilty one. Or are you? 

You look for a bar or a place to 
buy a bottle and then remember 
that you haven’t any money. You 
see Pat O’Malley up ahead of you 
in the crowd and hurry to catch up 
with him. He hasn’t any money 
either, so you suggest that both of 
you go to church. 

THE LAST DAYS OF L.A. 



“Why not?” he says. “We have 
only our souls to lose.” 

The two of you enter the first 
one you come to and the woman 
on the platform is an amazing sight. 
She’s big and full-bodied and has 
all the grace and arrogance of a 
lioness. She’s got the Word and 
she’s passing it out in large doses. 

“That’s Dr. Elinda A. Egers, 
D.G.F.,” O’Malley whispers. “Doc- 
tor of Complete Faith.” 

You watch fascinated as that lush 
body of hers moves restlessly around 
the platform. 

“In these troubled times the tor- 
tured mind of man is hanging in 
the balance, because he has forgot- 
ten his great enemy,” Elinda shouts. 
There’s a wildness in her eyes and a 
sensuousness in the way she moves 
her body that makes you move for- 
ward undl you’re sitting on the edge 
of your seat. Any stripper, you muse, 
would give her G-string to be able 
to imitate this woman’s uninhibited 
way with her hips. 

“Why are our asylums filled with 
millions of the mentally sick? And 
why are there tens of millions of the 
physically sick among us? WHY?” 
she demands at the top of her lungs. 
“Because the doctors and the psy- 
chologists absolutely fail to recog- 
nize or blindly refuse to recognize 
the demoniac origin of these ill- 
nesses. They have failed, my dear 
friends, because they are bound to 
the unreality of conventional 
science. They have failed because 
they did not look into their souls to 
see what God has written there for 
all to read. 

“If we face the truth, we will 
learn to recognize the presence of 

69 




demons and only then can we cure 
the inflicted!” 

Demons, you think. What a lovely 
idea. Perhaps you have fallen 
through a rift in time and come out 
in the Middle Ages with only won- 
derful things like witches and 
demons to worry about. You turn to 
O’Malley to tell him this, only to 
find him sound asleep. You’ve often 
wondered where he did his sleeping, 
and now you know. 

“The battle in the world today is 
not between nations but between 
Jesus Christ and the Devil!” She 
has gone into a kind of bump and 
grind routine now with her hands 
on those glorious hips and her body 
moving back and forth while her 
legs remain absolutely still. It looks 
real good from where you sit but 
you think it might look even better 
up closer so you leave Pat snoring 
gently and t^e a seat further to- 
ward the front. 

“Come to me and the Lord will 
put out his hand and save you. He 
has said unto me: ‘You shall have 
the power to cast out demons,’ and 
I have replied that I will do so. If 
you feel it, say Amen!” 

There is a lusty chorus of amen’s 
from the winos and bums who fill 
the auditorium. You have an idea 
they were attracted here by the 
same thing that keeps you on the 
edge of your seat. 

A man with the jerks of some 
sort comes down the aisle and the 
healing starts. Dr. Egers lays one 
hand on his head and the other at 
the back of his neck. 

“Get out of him, you demons! 
Out! Out! In the name of the 
Lord, I charge thee — get out!” 

70 



The man jerks even more vio- 
lently. “Heal him, Lord, heal him! 
They’re coming out . the demons 
are coming out. Can’t you feel 
them leaving you, brother?” 

The fellow jerks once more and 
almost falls as an attendant leads 
him away. “He’s cured,” Elinda 
shouts. “Praise God! He’ll never 
have another convulsion.” 

“Praise God! Praise God!” the 
congregation shouts. Only the still- 
jerking man seems to have any 
doubts as to his cure. 

“The Power of God will save 
you,” she says to the little boy now 
kneeling before her. “From the top 
of his head to the bottom of his feet, 
I charge you, Satan, come out!” 
She hugs the child against those as- 
tonishing breasts of hers. “Tliis can 
be your cure if you believe, Jimmy. 
All things are possible if you only 
believe. Litde Jimmy, do you have 
faith?” 

The boy nods his head eagerly 
and his face is so full of faith and 
belief that you find yourself nodding 
with him. 

“Restore him tonight in the name 
of Jesus Christ!” she shouts, placing 
her hands on his thin little legs. 
“This litde leg. Lord . send the 
Power to restore this little leg. Drive 
the demon of evil from it!” Her 
voice grows even louder. “The 
Power is coming! The Power is 
coming! The Power is within me 
now and it will flow from me to 
you. Do you feel it, Jimmy? Do you 
feel it? Do you feel it flowing in 
your legs?” 

She has lifted him from the floor 
and is cradling him in her arms. 
“Do you feel it, Jimmy?” 

GEORGE H. SMITH 




Christ, you can almost feel it 
yourself. 

“Don’t your legs feel different, 
Jimmy?” 

“I think they’re tingling a little,” 
he says. 

“Do you hear that?” she shouts 
again. “His legs are tingling! The 
God Power is making them tingle!” 
She lowers the child to the floor. 
“You can do it, Lord! Send the 
Power in the name of Jesus! Send it 
into this little foot, into this little 
leg. Try, Jimmy, try it for me, try 
it now!” 

Jimmy tries to stand up but 
wavers and falls. With renewed 
effort he manages to pull himself 
erect and stand swaying. 

“YOU’VE SEEN IT! YOU’VE 
SEEN IT WITH YOUR OWN 
EYES!” Elinda screams at them 
joyously. 

Sure they’ve seen it but they don’t 
seem much impressed. In fact, most 
of them get up and leave after this 
round. You ease yourself out of your 
seat and head toward the door, be- 
cause you need a drink, but you 
turn before goiilg out to look back 
at h^. She looks tired and disap- 
pointment shows in her full sensu- 
ous face. 

You know that she’s the most 
wonderful thing you have ever seen. 
You’ve found your religion. You’ve 
found something to worship — 
Elinda Egers, the only real goddess 
in the world. You’ll come here every 
night and the bomb won’t worry 
you because you have a religion 
now. Elinda Egers will save you. 
You head for the nearest bar, sing- 
ing “Rock of Ages” at the top of 
your lungs. 

THE LAST DAYS OF L.A. 



OU’RE RUNNING . run- 
ning, terror riding you like a 
jockey using the whip. You’re run- 
ning while a boiling sea of flame 
rolls over the city. Behind you and 
close on your heels come breakers 
of radioactive hell, smashing build- 
ings and lifting cars and people into 
the air. People are running on all 
sides of you. A girl in a spangled 
evening dress, a puffing little man in 
Bermuda shorts, a woman carrying 
two children, a man with a golf bag 
over his shoulder and two men in 
gray flannel suits followed by a 
woman in a sack dress that keeps 
blowing up over her face as she 
runs. 

The harder you run, the closer 
the fire seems to get. You can feel 
it singeing your back and the fat 
little man screams as a lashing 
tongue catches up with him and 
turns him into a cinder. The wom- 
an in the sack dress tramples across 
the bodies of the two men in gray 
flannel but the man with the golf 
club fights her off with his mashic. 
Then the four of them are eaten up 
by the hungry flames. You moan 
and your legs pump harder. There’s 
an underground shelter ahead and 
you run toward it only to find the 
entrance jammed with people. You 
try to fight your way in. You grab 
hold of a man but his boiled flesh 
comes away in your hands. Then 
you see they are all dead, packed 
together so tightly they can’t fall. 
You’re running again and you see 
the womam with the two childien 
only there’s nothing left of thcni 
but a charred arm and a hand 
which she still clutches. The girl in 
the evening dress falls in front of 




71 




you and you stumble over her. You 
see her dress and then her hair 
burst into flames. She throws her 
arms around you and you feel the 
suffocating flames. 

“Oh Lord — Lord/’ you moan, 
and wake up. The bottle of wine 
on the nightstand is only half empty 
and you drink from it gratefully 
and think of going out for more. 
But you remember your goddess 
and you know that you have to go 
to see her. 

She’s in good form tonight as 
she talks about the Kinsey Report. 

“If you’re listening, say Amen!” 
She raises both arms as she yells 
this and you’re amazed at the way 
her big breasts rise with them. 

“In the Old Testament, God de- 
manded death for the adulteress 
but Dr. Kinsey in his day tried to 
make her sins sound normal. But I 
tell you that this sin is the road to 
Hell, for the person and for the 
nation. God has destroyed other 
cities for this sin and His wrath 
will fall upon yours as well. 

“If you’re listening, say Amen!” 
“AMEN!” 

“Are you really listening? Do you 
honestly want to hear? Or do you 
prefer the way Los Angeles and the 
rest of the nation is going? Do you 
prefer the way of sex, the way of 
fornication and adultery? Do you 
prefer to read about sixteen-year 
old girls found in love nests with 
older men? Do you prefer to think 
of boys and girls in the back seats 
of cars? Do you prefer to think of 
some man’s hand running over your 
daughter’s body, touching her. .” 
Elinda Egers is swaying back and 
forth, her body rigid, her breath 

72 



coming faster and faster. 

Someone else is breathing heavily 
and you’re not surprised to find it’s 
you. 

“If this is what you want, say 
Amen!” 

“Amen!” you shout before you 
realize you’re not supposed to this 
time. No one seems to notice. Beads 
of perspiration are forming on the 
back of your neck and trickling 
down your spine. The tabernacle is 
jammed and there isn’t much ven- 
tilation. You’re dizzy with the wine, 
lack of food and desire. 

“Go ahead! Let your kids go to 
Hell! Let them read comic books 
and smoke and drink and fornicate 
in the back seats of jalopies! Let 
them go to filthy movies, let them 
listen to dirty jokes on television, let 
them look at the brazen women 
with their breasts hanging half out 
of their dresses.” 

“Oooooh ...” a woman in front 
of you moans, and you feel like 
moaning with her. 

“But if you don’t want these 
things,” Elinda shouts, her voice 
on the verge of breaking, “sing — 
sing, sing with me! 

"'Come homey come home, 

Ye who are weary. 

Come home” 

You are sitting in a metal room 
with telescreens on the wall and a 
big red button in front of you. 
Sweat is standing out on your fore- 
head and trickling down the back 
of your neck because you know the 
time is coming, the time when you 
have to decide whether to push 
that button and send a dozen 



GEORGE H. SMITH 




ICBM’s with hydrogen warheads 
arcing over the Pole. In the tele- 
screens you see cities . peaceful 
scenes of people going about their 
business. Then the people are run- 
ning, leaping out of their cars and 
leaving them on the street, vanish- 
ing into buildings and underground 
shelters. Your hand is poised over 
the big red button and your muscles 
are tightened as if your whole hand 
and arm were turned to wood, and 
you know that even if you have to, 
you can’t push that button and de- 
stroy half the world. 

Then in one of the telescreens 
there is a sudden white glare, and 
the screen goes blank- burned out 
— and then in anotlier telescreen 
you see destruction fountaining like 
dirty white dust boiling out of the 
streets . and you see the build- 
ings breaking and falling in rubble, 
and now you hear the people’s 
screams, a sound that tears through 
your guts and drives you crazy, and 
the rubble is falling and sending up 
more fountains of gray dust — and 
you know that this is happening to 
your own country, )our own peo- 
ple, you ha\ e to slnke hack, 
you have to push the button and 
avenge them, stop the slaughter by 
killing the enemy’s people and de- 
stroying their cities too, but you 
can’t make youi'self push the but- 
ton, your aim won’t move and your 
fingers are paralyzed, and then all 
the telescreens are glaring white or 
blowing up in clouds of destruc- 
tion, and you scream, scream in the 
metal room until you can’t hear 
anything but your own screaming, 
and then somehow you force your 
hand down and pu^ the button. 

THE LAST DAYS OF L.A. 



And just as you feel it go down, 
the walls of the room bui'st inward 
in a volcano of noise and terror and 
the gray dust comes swirling in over 
you, blotting out your screams. 

You wake up and hurry through 
the streets with this last dream 
hanging over you more heavily 
than any of the others. You’ve got 
to run — you’ve got to get out. But 
look at all the other people. None 
of tliem are running. They’re go- 
ing home from work — going into 
cafes, walking the dog ... oh God, 
walking the dog at a time like 
this. 

You’re scared. The bloody world 
is coming to a bloody end. You 
know it just as sure as you’re sit- 
ting here in the warm sun in Mac- 
Arthur park with the fifth you’ve 
bought and are drinking from in 
a paper bag. 

It’s close now. You’re not sure 
how close but it’s close. The world 
is coming to an end and you know 
you can’t convince anyone that it 
is. You feel the way Henny Penny 
— or was it Chicken Little? — must 
have felt. The sky is falling! The 
sky is falling! Hell — you’re just one 
more caterwauling messiah in a city 
of messiahs. Los Angeles, where 
every man is his own messiah. 

Then you know what the trouble 
is. You’ve been looking for someone 
to help you, when what you should 
have been doing was helping them. 
Now you realize that you are the 
one^ you are the messiah you’ve 
been seeking. It’s up to you to lead 
them out of the city into the wilder- 
ness. You drink more and you drink 
it fast and the more you drink the 
more a feeling of infinite compas- 

73 




sion comes over you for your fellow 
men. 

You can save them. You can do 
it You drain about two-thirds of 
the bottle and then get up and walk 
towai'd a man in that uniform of 
success, a gray flannel suit. 

“Wait a minute, friend,” you say, 
shifting the bottle to your left hand 
so you can take his arm with your 
right 

“What is it? What do you 
want?” he says, looking at you as 
though you’re drunk. 

“Have you seen the papers to- 
day, friend?” you ask. 

“Let go of me,” he says, pulling 
away. 

“If you have seen them, what are 
you going to do about it?” 

“I’m going home and eat my 
dinner.” He hurries off. 

You approach a plump, pretty 
little blonde pushing a baby car- 
riage. “Miss, can I have a few 
minutes of your time in which to 
save your life?” 

She looks frightened and tries to 
wheel the buggy around you. 

“Have you thought about the 
future of this dear little child of 
yours?” 

She breaks into a half trot and 
soon disappears with the baby car- 
riage bouncing along ahead of her. 

You sit down for a few minutes 
and have a few more swallows of 
the bourbon. When you get up 
you’re surprised to find that you 
stagger a little. But you’ve got to 
tell the people, you’ve got to make 
them listen. Your eye lights on a 
garbage can a short way off and 
you know you’ve found the way 
to do it. You take a stand beside 



the can and with the bottle tucked 
safely in your pocket you begin to 
pound on the can with both hands. 

“Hey, listen, everybody! I’ve got 
to tell you about the Last Days of 
Los Angeles. Listen to me! I can 
save you if you’ll just listen! You’re 
doomed. The city is doomed!” 

You pound like mad on the can, 
but this being L.A. where such 
things happen every day, only a 
very few passersby stop. “Gome 
over here and let me tell you about 
it!” you yell. “Do you know what 
the power of the H-Bomb can do? 
Have you heard of the C-Bomb? 
Do you know what nerve gas is? 
Have you seen the Sputniks over- 
head? Do you know how far an 
ICBM will travel and how fast? Do 
you know that there is no de- 
fense?” 

You grab a man by the arm, but 
he shakes you off, so you reach for 
a gray-haired old lady and get an 
umbrella in your middle from the 
dear little thing. 

“Boy, is he ever soused.” Two 
teen-aged girls are standing in front 
of you, giggling. “Did you ever see 
a guy so drunk?” 

You want to save them and you 
start toward them with outstretched 
arms, but they move back into the 
crowd. This makes you furious and 
you start to yell again. 

You grab the nearest person. It’s 
a woman but you shake her any- 
way. Someone has got to listen. 

“Let go of me, you masher,” the 
woman screams. “Help, somebody, 
help!” 

The crowd closes in on you. A 
sailor grabs you from behind and

IN THE BALANCE 

Book Reviews by the Editor 



OR, by James Blish (Avon, 
3’)^^), is a novel which began 
its inteimittent life some 17 years 
ago, as a story of mine called 
‘Mercy Death.” I had what I 
thought was a hell of a problem, 
but I couldn’t think of any way out 
of it, so the story remained about 
half written until c. 1948, when 
Jim Blish completed it as a novel- 
ette. It was published in Thrilling 
Wonder as “The Weakness of 
RVOG.” (All these initials refer to 
colors ;y(he alien creature in the 
story has a color organ in place of 
a mouth, and his name was origi- 
nally “Red-green-orange-violet,” or 
“RGOV.” Sam Merwin, then edi- 
tor of Thrilling Wonder, switched 
the initials around for reasons best 
known to himself, and now Blish 
has simplihed them to VOR.) 

The essential part of the story 
consists of my problem and Blish’s 
solution — the problem being, 

“What do you do when an appar- 
ently indestructible being tells you 
to kill him, or he’ll kill you?” For 
Blish’s solution, see the book. 



Whether there ever was enough 
meat in this story to be worth de- 
veloping into a novel, I don’t know ; 
I’m inclined to tliink not. At any 
rate, what Blish has done is to keep 
the original story more or less in- 
tact, and pad it by introducing a 
new set of characters and a new 
story line. The original characters 
were VOR (to give him his latest 
name), two scientists and a couple 
of supernumeraries. The new ones 
are a gaggle of CAP pilots, notably 
one named Marty Petrucelli wlio 
has a war-caused phobia against 
flying, and is losing his wife to a 
brash pilot named A1 Strickland on 
account of it. 

The GAP background is authen- 
tic and impressively technical 
(Blish was for several years a mem- 
ber of a GAP squadron) ; so is 
Blish’s marshalling of details about 
the AEG, radiation problems, 
atomic physics, and so on. 

The introduction of the CAP 
characters has some color of reason 
in the opening chapters: they’re 
the nearest squadron to the site of 




75 



the alien’s landing. After that, in 
spite of heroic efforts on Blish’s part 
to shoehorn them into the plot, 
they simply get in the way. 

As early as p. 50, for example, 
AEG Commissioner Holm con- 
fronts the alien, risking his life to 
try to open communication. If the 
story had been written from 
Holm’s viewpoint, this could have 
been a scene of hair-raising drama. 
As it is, it takes place almost in- 
visibly off-stage, while we get a 
worm’s-eye view of Marty and his 
stone-cold love life. 

In padding a novel, the problem 
is not to advance the story but to 
slow it down. This one is slowed 
to a crawl — one-sixth story, five- 
sixths the endless, repetitive emo- 
tional Laocoons that identify Blish’s 
hack-work. The writing itself, ex- 
cept for one or two notably good 
passages (particularly Marty’s flight 
with the scared Russian scientist in 
chapter 9), is as tortuous and knob- 
jointed as Blish’s worst. Nearly 
every sentence has too much in- 
formation packed into it; and since 
most of it is unnecessary informa- 
tion, the result is the same as if it 
were noise. 

Deadly Image, by Edmund Coo- 
per (Ballantine, 35^) is anotlier 
of those curiously muffled science 
fiction novels that keep coming out 
of England. This one tackles the 
old suspended-animation plot with 
more than usual plausibility — the 
hero, John Markham, is acciden- 
tally deep-frozen in an under- 
ground food storage chamber, be- 
ing prepared against World War 
111. The world he wakes up to. 



however, in the 22nd century A.D., 
is a flannelly compound of old 
ideas, tastelessly muddled. As in 
Jack Williamson’s The Humanoids, 
men have fallen under the rule of 
benevolent but overcautious ro- 
bots. Cooper adds the twist that the 
robots are close counterfeits of hu- 
man beings, male and female; his 
hero, in a bathetic sequence, tries 
to make a woman out of one of 
them, a girl robot named Marion- 
A. In the process, it seems to me, 
everything that makes a robot inter- 
esting is smoothed out; Coof>er 
might as well have made his robot 
characters human, and been done 
with it. 

The novel is not by any means 
all bad; there are nice touches here 
and there, and even some markedly 
good thinking. But it has the same 
exasperatingly blunted and dimmed 
quality as Bright Phoenix by Har- 
old Mead, A Sign of the Times by 
Robert Kee, and other recent Brit- 
ish work: and the same well-bred 
reluctance to travel any but fa- 
miliar paths. 

Signet has issued an amiable but 
fatheaded satire called 43,000 Years 
Later, by Horace Goon (35^), 
which you had probably better 
avoid. The burden of the book is a 
long series of homilies on man and 
his history — most of them qnex- 
ceptionable but awfully trite. And if 
you are extraordinarily sensitive to 
scientific ignorance, you may not 
even get through the first ten pages, 
in which Coon’s alien space- 
travelers arrive on Earth from their 
home “on the Great Galaxy” (Coon 
seems to think this is a gc^ name 



76 




for a planet), to find such relics of 
mankind’s 43,000-years-dead civili- 
zation as rusted auto frames and 
concrete dinosaurs. 



R oger Lancelyn Green’s Into 
Other Worlds (Abelard, $3.75) 
is a scholarly survey of space-flight 
ficdon in hard-bound books, from 
Lucian to “the latest scientifiction.” 
Lewis does not attempt to deal with 
the mass of material published in 
magazines, which is probably wise, 
and he stops with G. S. Lewis’s Out 
of the Silent Planet (1938) and 
Perelandra ( 1 943 ) , which he 
names “the highest peak” of space- 
travel fiction. Although startled, I 
think he’s right. 

Green’s religious and moral views 
color his judgments noticeably 
(e.g,, “the ghastly materialistic 
tenacity” of Olaf Stapledon’s Last 
and First Men in overcoming a 
hostile environment on Venus, in- 
stead of sitting on their noble fan- 
nies and admiring the work of 
God). He also drops some words 
about H. G. Wells that make me 
bristle; but it’s hard to hate a man 
who loves the Burroughs Mars 
books so unashamedly. 

He makes the usual confident 
scholarly blunders about space- 
flight: “A schoolboy . could tell 
you that a human being cannot 
stand an increasing velocity of mo- 
tion greater than thirty-two feet per 
second per second. .” Neverthe- 
less, a great deal of the ground he 
covers is new to me, and I found 
the book a provocative introduction 
lo science fiction before 1920. Rob- 
ert Cromie’s A Plunge Into Space, 



of which I’d never heard, seems to 
have been an 1890 forerunner of 
Tom Godwin’s “The Cold Equa- 
tions.” Other obscure works that 
sound very lively in Green’s de- 
scriptions are Legends of the Lakes, 
by Thomas Croften Croker ( 1829), 
Across the Zodiac, by Percy Greg 
(1880), Lieutenant Gullivar Jones: 
His Vacation, by Edwin Lester 
Arnold ( 1 905 ) , and V oyage to 
Arcturus, ♦ bv David Lindsay 
(1920). 

We also get the usual lengthy 
(and by now wearisome) discourses 
on Lucian of Samosata, Ariosto, 
Kepler, Godwin, Cyrano de Ber- 
gerac and the like, all of whom 
sound as dull as they ever did. In- 
cidentally, Green traces the history 
of that idiotic noisy meteorite that 
roars through all the bad s-f films, 
to its first appearance in Poe’s Hans 
Pfaal, and its second in Verne’s 
Autour de la Lune. 

What is surprising to me about 
the whole survey is that there 
should turn out to be so little in 
print on the subject, and so few 
ideas about other worlds and their 
inhabitants. The 17th and 18th cen- 
tury works are all pretty much of a 
stripe — satirical or moralistic fan- 
tasies with the moon or other 
planets as background. The Vic- 
torian novels have a monotonous 
family resemblance, too, and in fact 
only three or four writers in the 
whole lot seem to have produced 
anything really vivid and plausible. 
Probably adding the magazine 
stories would not lengthen the list 
much. 

Something will have to be. done 
about this.

VIKGII^

ROSEL GEORGE

GROVND 



Annie signed on a bride ship for Mars, There 
were forty brides. And when she got there, 
thirty-nine men were waiting. 



T he pilot shoved open the 
airlock and kicked the stairs 
down. 

“Okay, girls. Carry your suit- 
cases and ril give each of you an 
oxygen mask as you go out. The 
air’s been breathable for fifteen 
years, but it’s still thin to newcom- 
ers. If you feel dizzy, take a whiff 
of oxygen.” 

Th^iorty women just stood there 
and looked at each other. Nobody 
wanted to be first. 

Annie moved forward, her bulky 
suitcase practically floating in her 
hand. She was a big woman with 
that wholesome expression which 
some women have to substitute for 
sex appeal. She’d made a great 
senior leader at summer camps. 

“Fll go first,” she said, grinning 
confidence into the others. “I’m not 
likely to bring out the beast in 
them.” She waved herself out, let- 
ting the grin set and jell. 

It was odd to feel light. She’d felt 
too heavy as far back as she could 
remember. Not fat heavy. Bone 
heavy. 

The sweat on her face dried sud- 



denly. She could feel it, like some- 
thing being peeled off her skin. Arid 
climate. 

It was cold. But she had the 
warmth to meet it. 

There they were! Forty men. 
There were supposed to be forty. 
What if one of them had died! 
Who would go back? 

“Not me,” Annie prayed to her- 
self. “Dear Ck)d, not me.” She tried 
to count them. But they moved 
around so! 

They were looking at something. 
Not Annie. The girl coming down 
the ramp behind Annie. 

It was Sally, with the blonde hair 
on her shoulders. That’s all they’d 
be able to see from there. The 
blonde hair. 

But a man was coming forward. 
He had a tam-like hat pulled low 
to good-humored eyes, and an easy 
stride. 

“Wait, Ben,” one of the other 
men said. “See the others.” 

“I pulled first, didn’t I?” 

“Yeah. But you ain’t seen but two 
yet.” 

“I want that blonde one. Let 



79 




Gary see the others.” 

And he led Sally away. 

He didn’t feel her muscles or 
look at her teeth or measure her 
pelvic span. 

After Sally came Nora. Nora gig- 
gled and waved, making a shape 
under the shapeless clothes. Wasn’t 
that just like Nora? Okay. So she 
was cute. 

Second man took Nora. He didn’t 
wait for the others. 

Third man took Regina. Regina 
looked scared, but you could see 
those big cow eyes a mile off. 
Regina obviously needed somebody 
to protect her. 

The other girls came out. Annie 
counted and her heart hit bottom. 
Someone was going to be left over. 

Four women, three men. They all 
felt embarrassed. It was the kind of 
thing the colonists would talk about 
for years. Who was last. Who was 
second to last. Spiteful people 
would remember, and in a tight 
little community, spite took root 
and throve on the least misinter- 
preted expression or — But then, 
this wouldn’t be a tight little com- 
munity, Annie remembered. The 
lichen farms were spread out over 
the whole temperate belt of the 
world. Because the lichens were 
grown only on hills, where the sand 
would not cover them. And because 
they did a more efficient job of 
oxygenating the atmosphere when 
they were spread over a wide area. 

One man, hat in hand, even in 
the cold. A little shriveled man with 
a spike of dust-colored hair, but 
kind-looking. 

“Aw . he drawled in embar- 
rassment. He clicked his tongue. 

80 



“You’re both probably too good for 
somebody like me. I don’t know. 
Both fine women.” 

The two women stood in silence. 
“What’s your name?” 

“Annie.” 

“Mary.” 

“Mary? My sister’s named Mary. 
Fine woman.” He took Mary’s 
hand. “No disrespect to you, 
Annie.” 

They were all gone. 

“I could take you on my Venus 
run,” the pilot said. He, too, was 
embarrassed. “But I’m afraid I’ll 
have a full ship after that. Unless 
you can buy the weight and space. 
I’d be glad to take you free. But 
the company . .” 

Annie’s eyes were full but she 
wasn’t going to let them spill. 

Sally brought Ben by, already 
looking self-consciously married. 

“I’m sorry, honey,” she said. 
“Look, Annie, if you want to come 
stay with us until another shipment 
of pioneers come to break ground, 
you’re welcome. Maybe you’d — er 
— find one of them you liked.” 

It was a gesture of kindness, of 
course, but it made Annie’s eyes 
spill. She turned her head away, 
toward the red hills. Red and the 
cultivated ones green. Christmas 
colors. 

“Sure,” Ben said. “Swell. Any 
friend of Sally’s is a friend of mine.” 
And the way they looked at each 
other made Annie’s heart lurch. 

“Thanks, kids,” she said. “But I 
don’t believe I’ll try it. And don’t 
worry. This isn’t the first time I’ve 
been stood up.” 

“Are you coming?” the pilot 
shouted across the field. “Hate to 



ROSEL GEORGE BROWN 




rush you, but I’ve got a schedule 
to meet.” 

Was she coming? What else could 
she do? 

“What happened to him, Ben?” 
Annie asked. “My — the other man 
that should have been here.” 

Ben worried a hole in the sand 
with one foot and cleared his throat. 
“He stayed home.” 

“You mean he’s alive! Here?” 
“Well ... yes. But he didn’t—” 
“Never mind. I don’t need any- 
body to strum a guitar under my 
window. If he couldn’t get away 
from the farm today I can certainly 
go to him. I’ve got a pair of legs 
that’ll walk around the world.” 
“You coming?” the pilot shouted. 
“No!” Annie cried. “I live here.” 
The spaceship took off, a phoenix 
rising from the flames. 

Ben was shuffling his feet, hands 
in his pockets. “We’d be proud to 
have you stay with us, Annie.” 
“OE^cut it out, Ben. I’m no hot- 
house rose. Just tell me which way 
and I’ll find my own farm.” She 
paused, trying to guess his thoughts. 

“You think he might be disap- 
pointed when he sees me? Is that it, 
Ben? I know I’m no pinup girl. 
But I’m a worker and a breeder. 
He’ll see it. In the end, that’s what’s 
going to count.” 

Ben was still making holes in the 
sand with his feet, trying to say 
something. 

“Please don’t worry,” Annie went 
on, “your friend won’t be sorry. If 
he doesn’t want to marry me right 
away — okay. I can understand it. 
But I can give him a chance to 
watch me work.” 

“That isn’t it,” Ben said finally. 



“I think you look fine, Annie. It’s 
— it’s any woman. He told them not 
to send a wife for him. Any wom- 
an. 

“But that’s ridiculous. He knows 
the laws. Five years and then a wife. 
Why did he stake out in the first 
place?” 

“That was before,” Ben an- 
swered. 

“Before what?” 

“Aw, it’s not for me to say. Why 
don’t you just forget Bradman. 
He’s a good enough guy. But not for 
you. You come — ” 

“Which way and how far?” 

Ben looked at her hard. “Okay. 
On Mars your life is your own.” He 
pointed. “Second farmbubble you 
come to. And you’d better hurry. It 
ought to take eight hours and night 
falls like a ton of bricks here.” 

Annie made it in seven. Easy. 



S HE WENT up to the trans- 
parent hemisphere. He was in- 
side working. She shouted, but if 
he heard her he didn’t look up. 

She went to the flap that must be 
the door. There wasn’t anything to 
knock on, so she opened the flap 
and walked in. 

There was nothing in the room 
but a cot, kitchen equipment and 
lichen, growing on a number of 
tables. The air was richer than out- 
side and Annie breathed it thirstily. 

“I’m Annie Strug,” she said, smil- 
ing and wishing it wasn’t such an 
ugly name. 

He glanced up, angry blue eyes 
under a growth of black hair. He 
didn’t say a word. 

Annie set her suitcase down and 

81 



VIRGIN GROUND 




looked out at the green growth on 
the hills. 

“Look, Mr. Bradman/' she cried 
suddenly, pointing a spatulate fin- 
ger to the western horizon. ' What 
in the name of heaven is that?’* 
There was a catch of fright in her 
voice. 

“We don’t say ‘mister’ on Mars,” 
he said reluctantly. “Brady. But you 
don’t have to call me anything be- 
cause you’re leaving soon.” He was 
a big, arid man with a sandy voice. 
But his hands, as he stripped the 
lumpy brown fruits from a giant 
lichen, were surprisingly delicate. 

“What is it?” Annie asked again, 
turning instinctively to the big man 
for a reassurance and protection she 
had no reason to expect. 

Bradman straightened and 
moved away from her, looking at 
the black giant growing up from the 
earth in the distance and moving 
straight toward them. 

“It’s a sandstorm,” he said. “It’ll 
be here in ten minutes.” 

Annie let out the breath she had 
been holding. “Oh. That doesn’t 
sound so bad. I don’t know what I 
thought it was. I was just fright- 
ened.” She smiled shyly and apolo- 
getically at Bradman. 

Bradman grimaced at her, his 
agate eyes frozen in a pallid face 
that should have gone with red hair. 
The sand-blown lines in his face 
were cruel, “Sister, you’ve got a 
smile like a slab of concrete. Don’t 
try it again.” 

“You didn’t have to say that,” 
Annie said quietly, closing her eyes 
against the winds of her anger. 

“You didn’t have to come here,” 
he replied. “Goodbye.” 

•2 



“I’m not leaving,” she said, still 
holding tight the doors of her anger. 

“/ am.” He paced heavily over 
the sand floor and pulled back the 
flap of the door. 

“Where are you going?” Annie 
glanced back at the towering giant, 
now glowing red in the sunlight, 
like some huge, grotesque devil. 

“Into the storm cellar. Nobody 
lives through a Martian sand- 
storm.” 

Annie ran after him. “For God’s 
sake take me with you! You can’t 
leave me . .” 

“Mine’s built for one,” he said, 
and pulled the top in over him as 
he disappeared into the hole. 

Annie broke her fingernails pull- 
ing at the cover. The wind was 
blowing sand in her eyes. She saw 
blood staining the rim of her index 
finger. She pounded with her fists. 

“Let me in!” she screamed. “In 
the name of God!” But all she 
heard was the keening sand in the 
wind. 

She looked around. The devil was 
closer, malignant and hungry. It 
wanted to eat her alive. 

It made her angry. 

“I’ll fight it,” she screamed. “By 
God, I’ll fight!” 

Five minutes, she guessed. Maybe 
five minutes left. She ran into the 
house, ripped open her suitcase. 
Bundles of nylon marriage clothes. 
She began to sob. Some were with 
lace. 

“Fight!” she .shouted to herself. 
There was her oxygen mask. How 
much oxygen? Anybody’s guess. It 
was made for maybe a few whiffs a 
day over a period of several months. 

Swell. But it wouldn’t keep the 

ROSEL GEORGE BROWN 




sand from tearing through her eye- 
balls and flaying her alive. 

Wrap in nylon nightgowns? 
Ridiculous. 

Spacesuit? 

Annie went through die one- 
room house as fast as she could. No 
spacesuit. Why should he have one? 

Three minutes left. 

Sand was blowing under the 
hemisphere, piling up at one end 
and oozing out beneath. 

It was possible she would simply 
be buried. 

The refrigerator! 

That wasn’t a refrigerator. Only 
a cabinet, loosely joined. 

Annie went outside, on the side 
where the field of lichens grew up 
a smooth, stone hill. The red devil 
was whistling at her now; a low, 
insinuating whistle. 

Something rattled faintly against 
one steel rib of the hemisphere. It 
was a shrub, about five feet tall. 

Annie began to laugh hysterical- 
ly. Brady had protected the shrub 
with loving care. It was tied to the 
steel rib through grommetted holes 
in the hemisphere, and covered 
with its own plasdc bag to shield 
off the wind. 

One minute. 

The red devil was shouting now, 
laughing with triumph. He ran his 
sandy fingers through her hair and 
blew his gritty breath in her eyes. 

She pulled the zipper at the bot- 
tom of the polyethylene bag that 
covered the shrub and yanked the 
bag off. It was heavy, almost oily 
plastic, slippery and pliant. 

There was no time to decide 
whether it would be better inside 
or outside the house. She pulled the 

VIRGIN GROUND 



bag over her head inside out, so the 
zipper would close completely. 
Then she folded the zipper part 
under once and wedged herself as 
far as she could go into the space 
between shrub and hemisphere, 
holding the oxygen mask in her 
teeth. 

With infinite care, though she 
was not likely to split the heavy bag, 
she pulled off her shoes and her 
heavy, woollen walking socks. She 
put the shoes back on. Her slacks 
covered her legs. Only her ankles 
were bare. 

She unraveled one sock and 
stuffed the yarn in her ears. There 
was a sudden, remarkable quiet. 
Then, even through the yarn came 
the roar of the storm. For it was 
upon her. 

She looked through the milky 
plastic into a wild, red inferno, spit- 
ting at her in furious frustration. 
Then she bound the other sock over 
her eyes. 

She was in a blind, muffled world 
now, buffeted against the shrub and 
the wires and the steel rib, but not 
painfully, because of her heavy 
clothing. It was as though suddenly 
all her senses had been switched to 
the last pitch before silence. 

‘T might live/’ Annie thought. ‘T 
might.” 

T here was sand in the bag 
now. Annie could feel it sifting 
under her collar and blowing up her 
ankles. Not much. It was coming 
from the bottom of the bag. Prob- 
ably the end of the zipper had 
worked open just a little. 

Was that the dull roar of the 

83 




storm through her stoppered ears 
or the rushing of her own blood? 
If sand were seeping in, the storm 
must still be on. 

How did Bradman breathe in his 
storm cellar? Would the storm last 
long enough for the air to go bad? 
It would go bad fast, in an en- 
closed place on Mars. 

Bradman. What sort of monster 
would walk off and let another hu- 
man being die? Without a glance 
backwards? Did the cold desert 
wear the humanity out of a man? 
How did a human being get like 
that? 

“ ‘You’ve got a smile like a con- 
crete slab.’ ” Is that what you say to 
a person when you know you’re 
about to leave them to die? 

UNMARRIED WOMEN BE- 
TWEEN THE AGES OF 21 
AND 30. GOOD HEALTH. 
WELL ADJUSTED. MAR- 
RIAGE ON ARRIVAL. 
MARS TRANSPORT 
LEAVES OCT. 1. 

Good health . well adjusted . 
she could see the printed words, 
red stereo words reaching out from 
the page. Unmarried women be- 
tween . they came and went in 
her mind and there was a roar in 
her ears. The words were gone now. 
Only a redness that came and went. 
No. A^lackness. 

Annie snatched the exhausted 
oxygen mask off her face and 
gulped a pallid, sandy breath of 
air. It wouldn’t do. She took the 
sock off her eyes and bound it 
around her nose and mouth. It 
would filter some of the sand out. 



She opened her eyes briefly and 
closed them. The grit stayed in. 
She didn’t dare open them again. 

But the storm looked weaker. 
Or was it her imagination? 

She groped for the zipper. Foul 
air would kill her quicker than 
sand. She couldn’t find it. 

Hell with the zipper! She pulled 
her litde mending kit out of her 
pocket and slashed the bag with 
the scissors. 

The storm sounded louder now, 
with the bag gone. The sand blew 
under her eyelids. Ripped her face. 
Tore a burning circle around each 
ankle. 

Annie put her face in her hands, 
breathing through her nose and the 
sock. 

She held herself stiffly. She didn’t 
want to cough. 

The whole world was a blind, 
gritty pain. There was no end to 
think of. Only pain. 

A grayness. 

A blackness. 

Finally, a voice. Bradman. 

“You ruined my shrub. Did you 
have to slash the bag, too?” 

Annie opened her eyes. They felt 
red and ruined. They were water- 
ing so much her cheeks were wet. 
She could hardly see. 

She was having a coughing fit. 
She dragged herself upright. All 
she could see was sand. The plastic 
bubble had blown off the girders 
and if the furnishings and her suit- 
case were there, her eyes were still 
too dim to see them. 

“Do you know what that shrub’s 
worth on Mars?” 

Annie found the yam had fallen 
out of one ear and she pulled it out 

ROSEL GEORGE BROWN 



84 




of the other. 

“Do you know what that bag's 
worth?” 

Gall ran in her veins. She spat it 
out of her mouth. 

She backed up to the steel beam 
and braced her feet against it, light 
in the Martian gravity. 

“I told them not to send a wom- 
an out here.” 

She pushed off and sank her fist 
into his teeth. He went down. 

She was too light. But he was too 
light, too. It evened out. 

She turned his face and held it in 
the sand. Her strength was insane. 

“Do you know what a human 
life is worth?” she screamed. 

He struggled, but she fought his 
bucking body, kept his face buried 
in the sand until he was dead and 
a long time after. 

An age passed. Annie was frozen 
in a world rimed over with white 
starlight, sequinned with frost. 

Thetr^e crosseyed moons came 
up. 

•She found an edge of the plastic 
bubble, rumpled and limp and half 
buried in the sand. She pushed off 
the heaviest hills of sand with her 
hands and pulled it out. She 
climbed up the anchored girders 
with it, and then slept the rest of the 
night in her own home. 

The next day she dug out her 
household supplies from the sand. 

The day after she cleared the 
sand from the lichens on her farm. 

On the fourth day she called a 
few neighbors in and late in the 
evening she buried Bradman. 

No one questioned her. It had 
been, after all, self-defense. 

She kept the farm as well as any 

GROUND 



man. Better. She worked. How she 
worked ! She kept herself numb with 
labor, her mind drunk with the 
liquors of fatigue. 

After five years, he came. He just 
appeared inside the door flap, look- 
ing a little nervous but grinning. 

“Tm Jack Hamstrong,” he said, 
his voice full and wholesome, like 
Iowa corn. “I — you weren’t at the 
spaceport so I figured, what the 
heck. I just walked.” 

“This is my farm,” Annie said. 
“My hands are on every inch of it.” 

Hamstrong’s ruddy face turned 
in on itself a little. “I know. I know 
the story. I didn’t come to take any- 
thing away. I came to — good Lord, 
didn’t you know you’d be sent a 
husband?” 

Annie’s eyes went queer, like a 
cat’s. “A husband?” If they’d told 
her, she hadn’t heard. “Go away,” 
she said. She looked around at her 
farm, the fruits of her travail — 
alone. The virgin birth. 

“No,” he said firmly. “It’s yours 
and mine. Legally. I’m not a mean 
man, Annie. You’ll find me patient. 
But stubborn.^ I can wait.” 

Annie sighed. Or was it a shud- 
der? She looked up again at the 
puckering edges of the evening sky. 

She put down the knife she had 
been peeling a giant lichen with. 
She wiped her hands on her apron 
and lifted the door flap. 

“All right, then,” she said. 
“Wait.” 

“For what?” 

“The sandstorm,” she said. 

And she got into the storm cellar 
and pulled down the weighty lid, 
locking it behind her. END

^^it'XCUSE ME, sir,” Denton 
JlJ said deferentially, “but isn’t 
the gender of 'shar-su^ feminine?” 
“No,” Walsh replied brusquely. 
He turned away, to end the discus- 
sion, but Denton had already got 
A Lexicon of the Bi-Yan Language 
from its place on the cabin shelf, 
and was ruffling its pages. 

*'Shen — sheg — shar — ” he read. 
“Here it is. 'Shar-su. Adverbial 
noun of two terminations. Femi- 
nine. Warningly, in a warning man- 
ner. (To take) warning.’ Yes . 
it does seem to be feminine.” 
Walsh felt his face growing hot. 
How could he have forgotten that 
the damned word was feminine 
now, in the revised Gerson-Mc- 
Mahon grammar? In his student 
days there hadn’t been any gender 
at alHrrBi-Yan, or Te-Hok as they 
called it then. It seemed to him 
that things had been going to pot 
ever since that upstart, Gerson, had 
put over his revised system of pro- 
nouncing Bi-Yan, ten years ago. It 
meant that older scholars had prac- 
tically had to learn the language 
all over again. It was most unfair. 
Suppose there had been a few in- 
consistencies in the old phonetic 
system? Nobody could ever know 
how the Bi-Yan themselves had 



pronounced their language, and so 
what was the point of calling them 
Bi-Yan instead of Te-Hok? Or say- 
ing shar-su instead of mosh-ta? 

He must have muttered the old 
word under his breath, because 
Denton said in that irritating way 
of his, “I beg your pardon, sir?” 

“Nothing. Never mind. Well, 
you’ve proved your point. But don’t 
you think we ought to be getting 
back to the dig? It isn’t wise to let 
robot shovels work too long un- 
attended, you know. I imagine 
you’ll agree with me about that, 
at any rate.” 

There was an instant’s silence. 
Denton too had turned red. He 
Stood holding the lexicon between 
his hands, his head lowered Then 
he followed the older man through 
the airlock into the ship’s changing 
room. 

Their suits were hanging under 
sterilamps. Walsh climbed into his 
gear stiffly; his arthritic knee was 
bothering him again. Denton was 
ready before he was, and stood 
waiting while Walsh opened the 
outer lock. 

Walsh jumped to the ground. If 
he didn’t hurry, Denton would try 
to help him. Why had the Founda- 
tion saddled him with a “trainee- 



No one had labored harder in alien archaeology than Walsh, 

He was not going to let them destroy his life’s work now. 

87 




assistant,” anyhow? Did they think 
he was too old to excavate a Bi- 
Yan shrine without a younger man 
to help him? Hell, he was only 
sixty-four. An archaeologist wasn’t 
old until he was eighty. Or did the 
Foundation think that he, the dean 
of Bi-Yan archaeologists, the top 
authority in the field, needed a 
younger brain to check up on his 
work? 

The way to the dig was over 
rough ground. Like all the Proxima 
planets except one, Marianna had 
a thin, cold atmosphere, unbreath- 
able by human standards, but the 
surface was covered with primitive 
algae, lichens, molds and a few 
mosses. The puzzle was why the 
Bi-Yan had erected most of their 
tomb-shrines on these inhospitable 
planets, and almost none on the 
mother world. That was one of the 
questions he was attempting to an- 
swer in the book he had in progress 
— The Bi-Yan Tomb-Shrine: An 
Archaeological Estimate. 

Absorbed in these thoughts, 
Walsh stumbled over a loose stone. 
He would have taken a sharp fall 
if Denton hadn’t caught him by 
the elbow and steadied him. 

‘ Thanks,” Walsh said harshly, and 
jerked away. 

They reached the dig in silence. 
The robot shovels were working 
away carefully at the excavation of 
the back wall of the shrine, the 
only part yet unexcavated. The 
shovels stopped evei7 six inches for 
an automatic camera to take pic- 
tures of the sides of the trench. 

It probably wasn’t necessary to 
have so many pictures. It was a 
simple site. On the other hand, it 

88 



was the best-preserved Bi-Yan 
tomb-shrinc that anybody had ever 
found. All the others had been in 
various stages of wreckage. This 
one was almost miraculously per- 
fect. Except for an enormous gap- 
ing hole in the left wall, caused by 
a meteor impact cons ago, it was 
almost as it had come from the 
hands of its builders. 

Lovely . Walsh’s ill- temper 
was leaving him. It was impossible 
to feel anger while looking at the 
shrine. 

Denton was as affected as he. 
“Beautiful,” Walsh heard him say 
softly. “Millennia have gone by. 
And yet it’s like the first days of 
spring.” 

There were things to be said for 
Denton after all. “Let’s go inside,” 
Walsh said. 

The plan of the shrine was like 
that of all the other Bi-Yan tomb- 
shrines. A smallish oval building, 
p>erfectly proportioned, with a 
deeply recessed door. 

Inside, in the shrine proper, were 
the double storerooms, one on 
either side of the door, where the 
offerings to nourish the dead were 
kept. And then the inner shrine, 
with the checkered twenty-foot el- 
lipse on the floor that marked the 
“holy of holies,” and the statues 
of the dead whom the tomb — ac- 
tually a cenotaph — was designed to 
commemorate. 

“Stay clear of the ellipse,” Walsh 
cautioned automatically as they 
stepped into the inner shrine. 

Denton grinned. “Still think 
there’s a density field generator un- 
der it, sir?” he asked. 

“Yes. That, or something very 

MARGARET ST. CLAIR 




similar.” Walsh raised an arm to 
indicate the calligraphic inscrip- 
tions that ran around the interior 
wall of the cella. “The warnings 
about touching the ‘holy of holies’ 
are certainly explicit. The curse . 
Sooner or later we’ll tiy some ex- 
periments to find out just what is 
under the floor.” 

“Ye-es,” Denton replied. “There’s 
no doubt there’s something under 
there. Fragments of machinery 
have been found under the ellipses 
in other digs. But — ” He began to 
walk up and down restlessly, be- 
tween Walsh and the ellipse. 

“But!” Walsh said, trying to 
laugh. He didn’t like the way Den- 
ton kept arguing with him. “Do 
you think it was merely a coinci- 
dence that the dirt in the cella had 
stayed completely clear of the ellip- 
tical area? You remember, Den- 
ton — the cella was half full of dirt. 
It had been-dtifting in through the 
hole in the wall for centuries. It was 
packed up to the ceiling in spots. 
But there wasn’t a grain of dust on 
the ellipsoid.” 

“Oh, I remember,” Denton said, 
laughing. “I’ll never forget those 
two weeks with hand tools. But — ” 

“But what?” Walsh said with a 
touch of irritability. 

“Well, sir—” He hesitated. “Sir, 
what was the holy of holies /or.^” 

“For?” Walsh repeated rather 
blankly. 

“Yes, sir. What did they use it 
for?” 

“It was the center of the shrine, 
the focal point. If they ‘used’ it for 
anything — if there’s actually a 
density field generator under it — I 
think it was to immolate victims.” 

DISCIPLINE 



“To immolate victims?” Denton 
repeated. 

“Animal victims, in honor of the 
dead man whose cenotaph the tomb 
was.” 

“In honor of the dead man,” 
Denton repeated in an unsatisfied 
voice. He began to walk up and 
down even more rapidly. 

A bruptly he stopped in front 
.of Walsh. “Look here, sir,” he 
said, “have you considered — ” 
“Considered what?” 

“Considered — ” Denton paused 
to swallow — “considered, sir, that 
this may not be a shrine?” 

“May not be a shrine!” Walsh 
felt a touch of pure amazement. 
His eyebrows went up. He began to 
laugh. “Oh, my dear boy!” 

Denton flung out one hand in an 
impatient gesture. “Please, sir! 
What I mean is, why does everyone 
take for granted that the Bi-Yan 
constructions on the outer planets 
are shrines?” 

After a moment, Walsh decided 
to treat the absurd question as if it 
were serious. “For a number of rea- 
sons,” he replied. “The tomb ‘curse’ 
— you can read it on the walls here 
yourself — that is one of them. 
Then, there is the offering of food 
to the dead, and the holy of holies 
in the center. And, finally, the very 
existence of the shrines, so beauti- 
fully wrought, so filled with art 
treasures. There is nothing other 
than shrines that they could be.” 
“Isn’t there?” Denton asked 
keenly. “Isn’t any other explanation 
possible?” 

His voice had taken on that 

89 




needling edge that Walsh so dis- 
liked. He felt himself growing an- 
gry, and it exasperated him. “No,” 
he answered. “No, it isn’t.” He 
turned away. 

“But, sii--” 

“I don’t want to discuss it fur- 
ther. You’re not here to argue with 
me, Denton, but to be trained in 
archaeology.” 

Denton stepped in front of him, 
between Walsh and the elliptical 
area. “Don’t be such a fool,” he 
said in a low, choked voice. 

. Sorry. I — l^rry. You get un- 
der my skin. But if you’d only 
listen — ” 

“You couldn’t tell me any- 
thing,” said Walsh, losing control 
of himself. “You’re a young ass 
who brays instead of thinking. Keep 
your hee-haws to yourself.” His 
hands had clenched. 

“You old fool!” Denton cried 
wildly. “It’s not a shrine, it’s a 
ma — 

He was not allowed to finish the 
sentence. At the repetition of the 
unbearable word “fool,” Walsh, 
blind with fury, struck out. 

It was an old man’s blow, weak 
and badly aimed. But Denton in- 
voluntarily stepped backward to 
avoid it. He stepped across the 
dark-checkered rim, fairly into the 
elliptical area. 

His mouth came open. Walsh 
heard him give a faint cry. His 
body grew diaphanous. In less than 
two seconds after he had taken the 
backward step, he was gone. He 
had disappeared. 

Gone . Walsh looked around 
dazedly. It had happened so quick- 
ly that he couldn’t take it in. One 

90 



moment there had been the argu- 
ment, and his sudden anger. The 
next, Denton had been gone. Walsh 
felt an irrational impulse to go 
about the shrine looking for him. 

What had happened? Walsh had 
always felt the “holy of holies” was 
dangerous, but now that its potency 
had been actually shown, \\'alsh 
was stunned. The density field gen- 
erator must still have been active, 
after all these ages; poor Denton 
had been immolated in much the 
same way the old Bi-Yan priests’ 
sacrificial victims had been. An en- 
gineer could examine the generator 
later and find out how it worked. 
Walsh wouldn’t poke about with it 
— he didn’t want to share Denton’s 
fate. 

Had it been his fault? He gave a 
deep sigh. No, he didn’t think so. 
True, he had struck the blow that 
had driven Denton into the danger 
area. But on the other hand, he had 
warned him against the spot again 
and again, and Denton hadn’t lis- 
tened. There was a certain poetic 
justice — Walsh managed a shaky 
laugh — in Denton’s having fallen 
victim to the very “curse” whose 
existence he had denied, 

Walsh felt an overpowering fa- 
tigue. He hadn’t liked Denton. In- 
deed, he had hated him. But it had 
been dreadful to see the young 
man disappear like that. Walsh 
wanted to go back to the ship and 
rest — and, now that there was no 
longer a need to keep up appear- 
ances, there was no reason why he 
shouldn’t. He would feel better 
after a rest. 

He went outside the shrine, still 
haunted by the illogical feeling 

MARGARET ST. CLAIR 




that Denton must be hiding in it. 
He shut down the robot shovels. 
He switched off the lights. He’d 
come back later. What was it 
Denton had been trying to say 
when he disappeared? 

“This isn’t a shrine, it’s a ma — ” 
A what? What would the word 
have been if Denton had lived to 
finish it? Walsh didn’t even have 
an idea what the first syllable would 
have been. Man? Mar? Mat? Mat- 
ter .. well, it probably didn^t 
matter. Denton was gone. 

W ALSH entered the ship’s main 
cabin, switched on the phos- 
phors, and lay down in his bunk. 
After he’d rested, he’d get himself 
something to eat. And, before he 
went to bed, he’d tape an account 
of Denton’s mishap for the ship’s 
log. 

'Desperately tired as he was, he 
couldn’t ^lax. He kept shifting 
about on his mattress and sighing. 
No matter how he had felt about 
Denton, it had been appalling to 
see the younger man’s body thin out 
and disappear. Denton — 

What had Denton been trying 
to say? 

Walsh swung his feet around 
and sat up on the edge of his bunk. 
After a moment he rose and went 
over to Denton’s bunk. He opened 
the foot-locker. 

Denton’s diary was on top of the 
folded shirts and underwear, just 
where Walsh had often seen him 
put it. Walsh went back to his own 
bunk with it. 

He opened the book. He wouldn’t 
go too far back in the entries — say 

‘DISGIPLINE 



a week or ten days. Denton’s writ- 
ing was clear and easy to read. 

Almost at once Walsh found 
traces of what he was looking for. 
“More than ever I doubt the reality 
of the Bi-Yan ‘curse,’ ” ran an entry 
dated a week ago. “The ‘curse’ 
inscribed on the cella of the shrine, 
about whose direfulness Walsh is 
so insistent, seems to me, properly 
read, much less of a curse than a 
caution. Or — an idea I am just be- 
ginning to form — a series of in- 
structions. Instructions for what? 
I don’t know. I can’t but feel, 
though, that Walsh is basing his 
interpretation on a misconception. 
I don’t suppose it will do much 
good to tackle him about this.” 

Walsh raised his eyebrows. He 
gave a short laugh. But the curse 
had got Denton — poor young fel- 
low — in the end. 

He read on. Two days on unim- 
portant things. Then, “I cannot ac- 
cept the reality of the ‘neolithic 
psychology’ Walsh talks so much 
about. No comparisons with the 
tombs and shrines of ancient Egypt 
will convince me. It is, to me, in- 
credible that people as technically 
advanced as the Bi-Yan could be- 
lieve that by putting food in the 
tomb-shrines of their dead they 
were providing for them in the 
after- world. 

“Bi-Yan art is unsurpassed. We 
have a considerable body of evi- 
dence that their spaceflight had 
carried them to the ends of our 
galaxy. And these people thought 
they could feed their dead — or, 
rather, the images of their dead ; no 
one has ever found any bodily re- 
mains in a Bi-Yan tomb-shrine — 

91 




with canned protein? Faugh! 

“Nor does Walsh’s lugging in the 
‘transubstantiation’ of the old 
Catholic mass-ritual make his idea 
about the Bi-Yan any the more 
convincing. Again, faugh!” 

Denton seemed, Walsh thought 
sourly, to have used most of the 
space in his diary in trying to re- 
fute whatever W^sh had told him. 
He went on with his reading. 

The day before yesterday’s entry 
was only one line: “I have a hy- 
pothesis.” 

And then the last entry of all, 
yesterday: “Yes, I have a hypothe- 
sis. And, unlike Huygens and his 
idea about the existence of the rings 
of Saturn, I am not going to en- 
code it elaborately. 

“The Bi-Yan shrines are not 
shrines at all. They are relay sta- 
tions in a space-spanning system. 

“Why hasn’t anyone else sus- 
pected this? There are, I think, two 
reasons. One, the surpassing beauty 
of the Bi-Yan installations. And, 
two, the fact that no Bi-Yan 
‘shrine,’ except the one Walsh and 
I are currently engaged in exca- 
vating, has ever been found reason- 
ably intact. Meteor falls, mechani- 
cal failure in the course of ages, 
and wars have gutted them. Only 
in the present ‘shrine’ has the ‘holy 
of holies,’ which I suspect of being 
a matter-transmitter, survived.” 

. which 1 suspect of being a 
matter-transmitter. Walsh’s whole 
body was trembling. Oh, yes, Den- 
ton’s idea — damn him, damn him 
— had a horrible cogency. The cans 
of food: not offerings, but provi- 
sions for travelers. The curses, not 
curses but warnings and instruc- 

92 



tions on how to handle awesome 
potencies. 

Yes, Denton was undoubtedly 
right. And Walsh’s work — his 
whole work, the work of his whole 
life — had been wrong. He had built 
on sand. 

Everything he had written had 
been wrong. His new book, the 
book he had been preparing for 
thirty years to write, could n^er be 
written. It would be nothing but 
lies. And he would be a laughing 
stock. The dean of Bi-Yan archae- 
ologists. Talking about neolithic 
psychology as if he knew some- 
thing. It had taken a smart young 
man to show liim up. 

Walsh had to bite his lips to keep 
from groaning. Archaeology had 
been the only thing he had ever 
had, the only thing he had ever 
cared for. And now it had been 
taken away from him, forever, 
ruined by a few pages in a diary. 
Pages written by a smart young 
man. 

No. No, It hadn’t. No, it hadnH. 

Walsh didn’t even hesitate. He 
didn’t even give an order to his 
fingers. Of their own accord they 
reached for the diary and ripped 
the bad pages out. 

He drew a terrible, shuddering 
breath. On wobbling legs he walked 
over to the waste-reducer and 
threw the pages in. They flared up 
and were gone. 

It was going to be all right. He 
could forget all about the nonsense 
Denton had written. Now he could 
go ahead and write his own book. 
His wonderful, exhaustive, monu- 
mental book. 

For a moment Walsh covered 
MARGARET ST. CLAIR 




his face with his hands. God, if 
only he hadn’t been curious! Now, 
before he could think about his 
book, he’d have to fix things. He’d 
destroyed the diary, yes. But he 
hadn’t put things back to where 
they’d been before. He’d have to 
do a lot of lying to accomplish 
that. 

He’d have to make up some 
plausible account of what had hap- 
pened to Denton, something that 
didn’t involve the material work- 
ing of the Bi-Yan curse. And then 
he’d have to destroy the shrine. 

It was so beautiful! But as long 
as it was intact, it was a danger to 
him. The first engineer, if not the 
first archaeologist, to investigate it 
would surmise what the “holy of 
holies” was for. There must be a 
lot of machinery under the ellipsoid 
area where Denton had disap- 
peared. Walsh would have to de- 
stroy it. There was some blasting 
powder among the ship’s stores. 
Perhaps he could fake damage 
from a meteor fall. 

He was so tired. He’d try to 
concoct some reasonable-sounding 
story about Denton’s disappear- 
ance, and get it into the log to- 
night. He didn’t think he’d be able 
to sleep at all unless he got at least 
part of his difficulties settled. And 
tomorrow, when he was a little 
fresher, he’d try to destroy the tell- 
tale machinery. 

W HAT COULD have hap- 
pened to Denton, reasonably? 
A young man, strong, impetuous 
. Oh, now he had it. 

Denton had contracted a general 

DISCIPLINE 



infection from one of the local 
fungi or bacteria — it had been 
known to happen — and in his de- 
lirium had wandered off into the 
wasteland while Walsh was asleep. 

Then . oh, yes. Then Walsh 
had gone after him in the ship’s 
launch, and hadn’t been able to 
find him. He simply hadn’t been 
able to find him, that was all. 

It was such a simple story that 
Walsh was sure people would be- 
lieve it. It wasn’t complicated 
enough to sound like a lie. 
When he read it into the log, he’d 
put in some sad reflections about 
how Denton must even now be 
dying of asphyxiation. 

And that was probably the 
truth, Walsh thought. Wherever 
the matter-transmitter had sent 
Denton, even if there had been a 
still-functioning receptor at the 
other end, it wasn’t Ukely he’d be 
able to get away from there. Assum- 
ing he’d survived the journey, Den- 
ton must even now be sitting on 
the bleak surface of some wretched 
planet, watching the gauge on his 
air tank slip around to zero, and 
wondering how much longer he 
could last. 

A wretched way to die. But at 
least this was something Walsh 
didn’t have to blame himself for. 
He wasn’t even morally responsible. 
He hadn’t sent him there. 

He switched on the recorder. 
Better get his account of the mat- 
ter down now, while it was still 
clear in his mind. Tomorrow he’d 
destroy the site. 

He switched the recorder off 
again. It wasn’t so much that he 
minded telling lies about what had 

93 




happened to Denton. And certain- 
ly no reasonable person could ex- 
pect him to go after Denton, to risk 
his own life trying to save a man he 
hated. He could excuse himself 
these things. 

But he couldn’t excuse himself 
if he destroyed the site. 

He had put Denton’s diary in the 
waste-reducer ; that was disgraceful, 
but a personal matter. He was will- 
ing to connive at Denton’s death; 
he wasn’t under any obligation to 
try to save him. But he couldn’t 
destroy an archaeological site. A 
science, in the old and honorable 
term, was a discipline, 

Walsh’s head had gone up a little. 
He might be old, and a fool. He 
might be willing to tell lies. But he 
was a scientist. And he couldn’t 
destroy an archaeological site. 

Once more he switched on the 
tape recorder. He gave a full and 
complete account of what had hap- 
pened, including his destruction of 
the diary. He hesitated. Then he 
said, “I am going to try to rescue 
him. I do not think my chances are 
very good. Earth technology has 
not yet been able to build a matter- 
transmitter, and I have no idea 



what being ‘transmitted’ will be 
like. But I am willing to try to 
rescue him. End of entry.” 

He opened the ship’s belly, got 
out the launch, and climbed into 
the tiny cabin. On low manual 
power he worked the craft over the 
rough terrain, through the hole in 
the wall, and onto the rim of the 
elliptical “holy of holies”. He made 
sure that the nose of the launch was 
centered on the same dark- 
checkered area that Denton had 
stepped over. If there was any con- 
trol system built into the trans- 
mitter — anything that determined 
where you landed — that might be 
it. One more little push, and the 
craft would be over in the trans- 
mitting area. 

He paused. Did he still hate Den- 
ton? Yes, as much as ever. The 
smart young bastard. The smart 
right yonng son of a bitch. 

He was risking his life to save a 
man he still hated. He couldn’t ex- 
plain his action, even to himself. He 
grinned sourly. Still faintly grin- 
ning, he touched the manual con- 
trol and gave the craft the last little 
push. END

IN THE 

JAG-WHIFFING 

SERVICE 

BY DAVID R. BUNCH 



HAD ALWAYS said there was 
an easier way. And I think, when 
we invade, I’ll be proved right. But 
you know how things get started, 
and how powerful tradition can be 
and how old-line thinking can keep 
people, even a whole planet, in a 
rut. 

The big cargo saucers were get- 
ting bigger and bigger each year, 
what with the growing popularity 
of the jag- whiff places, and the jag- 
whiff places themselves were grow- 
ing in number with more and more 
people going “on the jag” because 
— well, partly because — of troubles 
in the sky, like strange balls whirl- 
ing around and unexplainable ob- 
jects going beep and wuff and wuff 
wuff. We of the saucers had slipped 
past these first baby objects O.K. 
and knew they were just little old 
harmless ping-pongs that chattered 



a little now and then like a greeting 
going past. But tell the people that! 
They’d throw a big glass on one of 
the whirlers and see spikes sticking 
out and maybe a big pair of eyes 
inside and a nose and a long red 
tongue hanging down. “The 
Earthits!” they’d scream like they’d 
just fallen into one of the hot 
canals, and they’d race oflF to a jag- 
whiff jag like Judgment-Day-of- 
Sins itself was after them. And the 
funny part of it is, I guess the peo- 
ple were right being scared like 
that, the way things turned out. 

But is it any wonder we were 
having to increase the size of the 
saucers to space-haul all that jag- 
whiff up through the rattleballs? 
And a big reason makes me think it 
could have been done more effi- 
ciently, we were having to take so 
much junk stuff, extra accessories 



The jag-stuff in those black rings was wonderful, but why 

did they have to package it with so many extra accessories? 

95 




I guess you’d call it, to get the jag- 
whiff. Our Earthit contacts were 
always giving us the old breeze 
about cost of labor, cost of materi- 
als, improvement in design and 
next year’s inventories. Apparently 
the dealers didn’t understand at all 
what the play was with us because 
they’d give us so much blab-blab 
that didn’t apply, all about futur- 
istic design and about how one jag- 
whiffer machine had it all over an- 
other jag- whiff er machine, which 
to us didn’t mean a thing. And we 
didn’t talk, because we’d heard al- 
ready how some Earthits feared the 
saucers, and how some Earthits said 
they didn’t exist at all, and how 
some other Earthits were on the 
fence, saying maybe they did maybe 
they didn’t so what? and how there 
was wide fear and great unrest 
among the Earthits in general. And 
when it’s like that, and you’re a 
possible source of the wide fear and 
unrest, a whole planet full of peo- 
}:jle can easily decide they don’t 
want any part of contributing to 
> our pleasure. 

And that’s what the jag- whiff 
was to us actually, pleasure. Back 
home when our troubles had us 
down, or maybe we just felt like 
raising a little dust, we’d go to a 
jag- whiff place. We’d plunk down 
our pay-pictures, and the whiff- 
tender would wheel out one of those 
black rings, which they have to keep 
under special pressures in our cli- 
mate. Then he’d screw on the tube 
with the face piece and we’d take 
our whiff and something out of the 
black ring — just seemed like real 
thick chest filler to me — would 
spread all through to the farthest 



reaches of our breath bags and go 
into our blood and suddenly all five 
of our eye sticks would start whirl- 
ing and focusing and zeroing-in for 
dames and our arms and legs would 
start a kick and a slap dance, 
enough to shake the planet down. 
And when our face spines and head 
tubes would go into that special 
sharp buzz of contentment, we’d 
know we were on our jag, full and 
warm and happy with as much 
pleasure as any Martian is ever sup- 
posed to know. But we never re- 
vealed the play to our Earthit con- 
tacts, just slipped in at night in our 
noiseless saucers with all lights 
dimmed, cleared our cargo tubes 
of the tons of pay-picture we’d 
brought (green copy of the Earthits’ 
currency) and took on as many of 
the gleaming jag-whiffer machines 
as our cargo tubes would hold. 

B ut it is ten years now since 
a jag-whiffer captain has 
steered his saucer through the 
whirling balls. It got so the satellites 
would drum on the saucer from a 
long way out. Deafening! Dreadful! 
We saw what was coming and we 
tried to beat it. We saucered around 
the clock for a while trying to stock- 
pile enough jag-whiff to last us. But 
of course we couldn’t. We are about 
out of it now, and our land is 
strewn with the glittery shells that 
were once attached to the black 
tubes of the jag-whiff. 

And it could all have been done 
so different. I’m sure it could. Th^t 
stuff wasn’t just in the tubes of the 
jag-whiffer machines down there, 
I’m convinced of that. That stuff 



96 




may have been all around us down 
there. I believe it was. But our 
government would insist we get 
into these suits, about so far out, 
you see, about the time we’d start 
contacting the rattle balls. And they 
threatened us with removal of the 
contacts if we broke the rules about 
the suits. In addition to that, they 
said we’d die anyway. So you see 
how life can be — grim and fuzzy 
and unsafe most of the time. And 
to make things even more uncer- 
tain, just because they couldn’t 
duplicate the product we were haul- 
ing, our scientists got uppity and 
ignored the whole problem. Except 
to run off to the jag- whiff places 
of course to ease their frustrations, 
which they did plenty often when 
they thought they wouldn’t be seen. 

But when we invade down 
through there, which we plan to do 
soon now, with our special equip- 



ment to catch and explode the 
whirlyballs, I think we’re going to 
find out plenty. Among other 
things, I think we’re going to find 
out that the stuff we cargoed up 
here at such great cost, that was so 
inefficiently packaged, is all around 
us down there. I think when we 
take over down there, with the right 
filtering equipment, jag- whiffing

nomical as breathing. And another 
thing, I think we’re going to find 
out we were taken for quite a ride 
by the Earthits with their silly way 
of packaging jag- whiff. Imagine 
having to buy all that chrome and 
steel, guaranteed to go over one 
hundred miles per hour, just to get 
four little black rings of whiff. And 
for all the Earthits talked about it, 
the rings with the white sidewalls 
didn’t whiff one bit better than the 
others! END 



THE LAST DAYS OF L.A. 

(Continued from page 74) 
a man in working clothes hits you 
with a lunch bucket. You let go of 
the woman and hit back at him. 

“Help! Help!” the woman is still 
yelping. 

“Call the cops — a man’s trying 
to rape a girl!” 

Someone hits you with an um- 
brella, and you know it’s the same 
dear little old lady. A guy grabs you 
by the neck and tries to throw you 
to the ground but you kick him in 
the groin and trade punches with 
two otliers. Then they’re all over 
you. The old lady trips you and 
you go down. She starts beating you 
with the umbrella as a man’s foot 



smashes against your head. You see 
a woman’s nylon-clad leg as she 
raises her spiked heel and brings it 
ripping down across your cheek. 
Other feet crash into you. 

“Let me help you,” you’re still 
yelling, but they keep on kicking. 
Some of the shoes have blood on 
them, you notice through the haze, 
but they still keep on kicking. 

Then it's getting dark and you 
lie there and think how Henny 
Penny — or was it Chicken Little? — 
must have felt. You want to tell 
someone about it but you don’t. 
You just lie there and wait for the 
screaming sirens to come and take 
you away. END

E veryone should have 

known. They should have 
known as surely as though it were 
written in the curved palm of the 
wind. They should have known 
when they looked up at the empty 
sky; they should have known when 
they looked down at the hungry 
children. Yet somehow they did not 
know that their last migratory hunt 
was almost over. 

The straggling band had woven 
its slow trail among the mountains 
for forty days of vanishing hopes 
and shrinking stomachs. Ahead of 
the main party, the scouts had 
crawled until their knees and palms 
were raw; but still there was no 
track of game, and the only scent 
was that of the pungent air that 
rose from the ragged peaks of ice. 

At last they halted, only a few 
footsteps from The Cave of the 
Fallen Sun, the farthest western 
reach of their frozen domain. In the 
rear of the column the women 
threatened the children into silence 
and the scouts went first to the 
mouth of the cave to look for signs 
of an animal having entered. Pres- 
ently the scouts stood up with their 
massive shoulders drooping, turned 
to the rest and made a hopeless ges- 
ture. 

Atanta, who stood alone and mo- 
tionless between the scouts and the 
rest of his band, knew that all were 
waiting for him to use his magic to 
make a great leopard appear in the 
empty cave. “A very great leopard,” 
he thought sarcastically. Enough to 
feed them all for a hundred days. A 
leopard so huge it would whine piti- 
fully while they killed it. A leopard 
so gigantic that it would not leave 



its footprints in the snow. Indeed, 
Atanta was sure, the leopard his 
people wanted would be much too 
large to fit into the cave. Weil, per- 
haps there would be a bird. 

He held himself very tall and 
straight so that his dejection might 
not show to either his people or his 
gods. But after forty days of the 
trackless hunt, Atanta felt with cer- 
tainty that the gods were deaf or 
dead ... or at least very far away. 

The sun was hot and the gods 
were gone, and he would not keep 
his people waiting with false hopes. 
He closed his eyes and took up the 
crude bone cross that hung from 
his waist, and he cursed the gods 
with silent venom. And when his 
chastisement of the delinquent gods 
was done, he dropped the cross to 
dangle at his waist again. 

Two hunters moved stealthily 
forward, their spears disappearing 
before them into the cave. It was 
somehow pathetic, Atanta felt, the 
way they moved so courageously 
into the empty darkness. 

How many caves had there been, 
Atanta wondered, since they left 
the mouth of the river? Fully a 
dozen, always empty, except for the 
scattered bones of bears and men. 
Perhaps he should have kept his 
people at the river. No, he told 
himself. He had done the only thing 
he could do. The season had been 
bad and their meager catch of fish 
carefully stored. But the already 
heavy ice thickened with the ap- 
proach of winter and made fishing 
almost impossible. When their sup- 
plies were almost gone, he had done 
as so many had done before him. 
He had led his people on the futile 



99 




hunt, hoping for the miracle of a 
dozen sleeping bears or a great 
white leopard. Such miracles had 
happened in the past. Once he had 
gone with his father on such a win- 
ter hunt. 

But miracles without footprints 
were quite another matter. That 
was the way his people lived: just 
existing when the catch was good, 
starving when it was not. 

Presently the two hunters stepp>ed 
out of the darkness with the blunt 
ends of their spears dragging be- 
hind them, and their countenances 
told the others that the cave was in- 
deed empty. 

Cliildren began to cry. Women 
picked up their packs and slung 
them across their shoulders. The 
men mumbled inaudible words that 
turned into whisps of smoke in the 
icy air. At Atanta’s signal, everyone 
entered the ice-floored cave, thank- 
ful at least to be out of the blinding 
brightness of the sun and snow, and 
into the soothing dark where they 
could rest. 

Atanta stood while his people 
stretched their furry bodies out over 
the frozen ground. He looked down 
at his woman who lay before him. 
watching him with her black eyes 
large and warm. It made his 
stomach clutch itself into an angry 
knot, to see her young face so drawn 
with exhaustion and hunger. There 
were lines in her face he had never 
seen Ubfore ; the fur of her head and 
body had lost its sheen and was now 
brittle and dry. She patted the ice 
and motioned him to lie down be- 
side her; but he turned his eyes 
away from her, because he knew 
that he must tell the others before 



■ he could rest. 

“Listen to me,” he said, and his 
voice rang through the ice-sheeted 
cave. The tired eyes of the men 
and women opened and everyone 
sat up. 

How should he tell them? They 
were waiting now. Should he simply 
say it swiftly and have done with it? 
Tell them that they had followed 
an impotent god until now they 
were to die? Surely he should pre- 
pare them somehow. Prepare them 
for the importance of what he was 
to say. 

“Listen, for I tell you of the end 
of the empty caves.” 

He stood silent for a moment 
watching hope filter into their faces, 
hope that made their dull eyes shine 
in the semi-darkness. 

“Do not let joy curl your lips 
until you have listened, for it would 
be a false joy.” 

The lines of tiredness and worry 
returned to the faces about him. 
Atanta did not look down at his 
woman’s face, for she knew him 
very well and she would know what 
he had to do. 



E ARE told of a time 
long ago, when the cave of 
man was filled with food as the 
night is filled with stars, and the 
caves and the men covered the five 
corners of the world. But these were 
not the caves that we know now. 
They were magic caves, and these 
were magic men. The men of that 
long-ago world created the very 
mountains into which they dug their 
caves. The mountains they created 
raised their peaks through the high- 




100 



BERNARD WALL 




est clouds, and every mountain held 
countless caves . caves stuffed 
with bear and fish and captive win- 
ter winds. These were magic times 
when every man was a priest. Every 
man could make fire blossom from 
nowhere and every man could fly 
through the air like a bird. 

“All this was long ago when the 
world was young, and the world was 
hot, and our people could live in 
the heat. But Nuomo the God of 
Night became jealous of these 
magic men, for he had seen them 
fly into the night itself in search 
of the stars. And so Nuomo 
wrapped his black wings around the 
world and shook it for ten tens of 
days. The world cracked and burst 
with flame that sprouted up into 
the darkened sky. The people ran 
in terror and their mountain-caves 
were sucked down into the earth or 
burned into ash by the flame. At the 
end of the ten tens of days, Nuomo 
thought that all were dead and so 
he rolled a sheet of ice across the 
earth to cool it. 

“Only one man was able to es- 
cape the wrath of that ancient 
god. He was an old man with only 
little magic and he felt liimself on 
the edge of death. He took from his 
body a rib which he fashioned into 
a son. But he made the son in such 
a way that he could live upon the 
ice itself, as we do now. 

“The son knew that the old man 
was about to die, and so he said: 
‘Father, use your magic to make 
a woman to keep me from being 
lonely.’ 

“ ‘Woman!’ the old man cried. ‘I 
should think you would want me to 
teach you the use of magic.’ 

STAR OF REBIRTH 



“ 'Yes, father,’ the son answ'eicd, 
‘if you can.’ 

“ ‘No,’ the old man told him. ‘I 
am so near to death there is no 
time. A woman will have to do.’ 

“And so the old man drew from 
his chest another rib which he 
fashioned into a woman. This being 
done, he turned to his son and said : 
‘My son, the time has come for me 
to die. Do not mourn for me, for 
when each evening comes you will 
sec my home — the red star which 
travels quickly in the night. For 
many ten tens of years, I have been 
preparing it to become a suitable 
place to be born again. When your 
time comes, you too will be wel- 
come there.’ 

“Thus saying, the old man placed 
his hands upon the shoulders of his 
son. Then he wrapped his cloak 
about him and rose up into the 
heavens to the star of rebirth. 

“Only when the old man had 
gone to the star of rebirth, did the 
son turn to his woman. Only then 
did he see that she had not been 
made in his image, for she was 
hairless and delicate and not made 
to live upon the ice. She was a 
Hotland woman. But the son, whose 
name was Dectar, took his woman 
whose name was Sontia, shielded 
her from the icy winds and com- 
forted her as best he could. Some of 
their children had hair and loved 
the cold ; some were weak and hair- 
less and did not. In those days the 
hunting was good and the strong 
sheltered the weak, fed them, car- 
ried them on the long hunts. But 
Sontia was a jealous woman. 
Jealous of her strong husband and 
their offspring of his kind. She 



101 




prayed to Ram, God of the Sun, 
and begged him to melt the ice. 
And so the ice began to melt, leav- 
ing the Hotlands a paradise for 
weak selfish creatures. Sontia de- 
serted Dectar, taking with her those 
of their children who were hairless 
and weak like herself. 

“When the ice began to melt, we 
sons of Dectar were forced to hunt 
farther northward year by year. The 
game became not so plentiful as it 
had been. Our people learned to 
fish and hunt as we do now — to fish 
in the summer, to hunt when the 
ice becomes thick. 

“But the jealous sons of Sontia 
who swarm in the Hotlands were 
not content to see us perish year by 
year. Even to this day, if we should 
wander down to the edge of their 
domain to beg for a few scraps of 
food, they would answer our plea 
with death. And even in death they 
would allow us no dignity, but 
would strip us of our liides and 
wear them in mockery. 

“I tell you of this now, because 
when a man comes on a long hunt 
which ends in an empty cave, it is 
well to remember and be proud of 
the successful hunts of other years.” 

Atanta took the white bone cross 
carefully from about his waist. 

“It was I who first saw this god 
go across the sky.” He held up the 
cross for all to see. “it went slowly 
like a bird from horizon to horizon 
and I knew that it was not a bird 
for it did not flap its wings, but kept 
them still and outstretched. I be- 
lieved it to be the god who would 
fill our hunting trails with game, 
but now I know that this god is im- 
potent. At worst it is a foolish god. 



lying somewhere on the white float- 
ing ice of heaven, wallowing in 
idleness while my people starve.” 

He dropped the cross to the 
smooth ice floor, knelt and smashed 
the cross into pieces with one swift 
blow of his hammerstone. 

When he looked up the people 
were silent and unmoving. Perhaps 
he had been a fool. Perhaps he had 
told them nothing they didn’t know. 
Perhaps they had already given up 
and knew that they would die here 
in the cave and that he could pro- 
duce no magic to help them. 

“Will you take another god?” one 
of the scouts asked. 

“I see no other god to take.” 

“Then do you think we can be 
delivered without a god?” 

Wasn’t it evident? Surely they 
must know. Should he tell them 
there was no deliverance, with or 
without a god? 

“I don’t know,” he lied. “I don’t 
know.” 

Ark’s woman drew a strip of 
leather from the mouth of a sleep- 
ing child and put it in her own 
mouth. “Then you’ll have to deliver 
us yourself,” she said and lay down 
to go to sleep. 

A sudden rage burned in Atanta’s 
brain. The muscles in his square 
jaw trembled as he glared at the 
sprawling furry figures, who would 
lie there and die while they waited 
like children for him to provide for 
the future. 

Abruptly he turned and left the 
cave, and walked out under the 
yellow sun that made the ice-cov- 
ered mountains shimmer. He felt 
that he must get away from them. 
He did not want to die with fools. 



102 



BERNARD WALL 




T he sun blazed hot upon the 
hair of liis head and back as he 
traveled rapidly downward and 
away from his people in the cave. 
He traveled too quickly to think of 
anything else but where his next 
footstep should be, and within an 
hour he was at the edge of a great 
ice field that stretched itself out be- 
fore him like the footprint of a 
giant. There could be no more swift 
traveling now. Cautiously, he 
started out over the empty plain, 
prodding the ice before him with 
his spear. 

It was not that they were chil- 
dren. He knew that he had been 
wrong to judge them so. There was 
nothing they could do. They had 
walked their lives away on the long 
hunt that ended now without a sign 
or scent of prey. 

And he, Atanta, had led them. 
They were strong and loyal people, 
too, for if he ordered them up and 
back along the trail that they had 
come, each man would go without 
a word and hope that there was 
some magic Atanta had yet to use. 

But the animals were gone and 
the gods were gone, and there was 
but one thing left. He would go 
down below this range where the 
Hotlanders were known to be. 
Probably he would simply die in the 
sun. If not, the Hotlanders would 
kill him on the spot, as they were 
usually so quick to do. The Hot- 
landers had good magic. Not as 
good as his ancestors’, Atanta was 
sure. But still, they could kill a man 
from a great distance, simply by 
pointing a magic charm and mak- 
ing a certain noise. 

Perhaps the Hotlanders wouldn’t 

STAR OF REBIRTH 



see him and perhaps he would not 
die in the sun. Perhaps he would 
find some game by the edge of the 
Hotlands. Perhaps . 

The sun had tucked itself behind 
a white western peak when Atanta 
at last came to the end of the ice 
field. Tired now, he crouched for a 
moment like a bird with his bottom 
sitting squarely upon his heels. Pres- 
ently his tiredness became true 'ex- 
haustion, so he dug himself a little 
space in a shadowed snow bank 
and then covered himself with a 
mound of snow. 

While Atanta slept, a great lost 
bird came on the last feeble rays of 
light, flapping its black wings be- 
cause there was no wind to glide 
upon and there was no footing but 
the frozen ground. When above 
Atanta, the bird caught a slight 
scent in the air, held its wings stiff 
and tilted itself to glide in slow cir,- 
cles that became smaller and small- 
er and ever lower until at last the 
bird’s tired feet sank deep into the 
snow beside the mound where 
Atanta lay. The bird folded its 
wings about itself and pecked at the 
mound, its beak digging cautious 
holes in the snow. Atanta stirred 
slightly at this intrusion, and the 
bird drew its beak away and flapped 
its wings against the windless air 
and flew away. 

When Atanta woke, the night 
wind had curled itself with a scream 
about the mountains and brought 
with it a fresh snow. He dug him- 
self from his bed and smiled with 
his eyes closed at the night that sent 
the wind and snow to caress his 
hair. When he opened his eyes, his 
face was tilted upward to the sky, 

103 




and he smiled at the lonely stars. 

The moon was full and heavy 
tonight, and it hung low in the 
western sky. Atanta wished his 
woman could be here beside him, 
nestling close to him in the soft 
show, her delicate hands caressing 
the hair on his cheek. He thought of 
her hands rubbed raw from the 
straps of the heavy pack. Perhaps 
it was better that he had left with- 
out saying goodbye. 

He felt rested enough to go on, 
and was about to hoist himself to 
his feet when the red star caught 
his attention. For months now it 
had been growing brighter with 
every night that passed, as if herald- 
ing some important event. This was 
the red star of rebirth, and he 
wished he could believe that he and 
his people would someday go to live 
there; but he no longer believed in 
anything. 

It was then that Atanta saw the 
god. It was a great and fearful god 
that turned the black night yellow 
and screamed louder than the wind. 
In an instant it fell out of the sky; 
then the yellow light was gone and 
the voice of the god was gone, and 
the dark night returned and the 
voice of the wind returned. 

Atanta fell to his knees and his 
trembling hand etched out the sign 
of the cross in the snow. Surely this 
must be a sign. The god had eome 
out of the sky and fallen in the path 
before him — forbidding him to go 
into the lowlands. He knew he must 
pray and ask forgiveness but for 
many moments he was too fright- 
ened to pray, and when the fear 
subsided, he was too proud. Why 
should he pray to a god who would 

104 



let his people starve? He raised his 
eyes, and saw the very head of the 
god peering up above the next rise. 

He stood up with a semblance of 
dignity on his unsteady legs. When 
the god did not move from behind 
the rise for many minutes, Atanta’s 
courage overbalanced his fear and 
he kicked the snow with his foot 
and obliterated the sign of the cross. 
He waited for the god to strike him 
dead, but nothing happened. The 
head of the god was motionless. 

Atanta set out with cautious 
steps. Presently he hid behind a 
little ice dune where he could see 
the god in its awesome entirety. 
Now he was close enough to hurl 
his spear at it if the^god suddenly 
struck in anger; and he gripped the 
spear in readiness. Suddenly he was 
filled with a new awe, for he real- 
ized that this was not the god of the 
cross! There were no stiff wings at 
its side. It was like a huge shining 
spear with its dull end stuck in the 
snow and its point stretcliing up to 
the sky. But how could this be a 
god? 

Perhaps he should not yet pray. 
Time had shown there were many 
false gods. 

Presently a black mouth ap- 
peared magically in the side of the 
great still thing. The mouth sucked 
in the icy air for a moment and 
then extended a long jagged tongue 
down to the fresh snow. 

Atanta saw something move in 
the blackness of the gaping mouth 
and then a figure stepped out onto 
the tongue and looked about at the 
falling snow and the white jagged 
mountains in the darkness. It was 
the figure of a man. At least it was 



BERNARD WALL 




in a man’s shape, but it did not look 
like a man of the mountains nor 
did it look like the man-creatures 
of the Hotlands. It walked slowly 
and laboriously down the tongue, 
and it seemed to be made of the 
same shiny stuff as the tongue and 
the flying wingless god itself. For 
a moment, Atanta wondered which 
was the god. The great huge thing 
with the mouth and the tongue, or 
the man-thing? 

The stranger stepped off the 
tongue into the snow where he 
knelt and scooped up the snow in 
his arms, tossed it into the wind 
which hurled it to the ground again. 
Then he stood and clutched his 
head. For a moment Atanta 
thought he had taken his own head 
off, but then he could tell that 
he had taken a covering off his head 
which he tossed into the snow. 
Then it seemed that the man had 
been entirely covered, like the men 
of the Hotlands who wore furs. 

Presently the man had taken off 
all his covering, and stretched his 
furry arms up to feel the sweetness 
of the wind. Atanta leaped up, 
shouting his surprise. For tliis was 
a true man. 

For a moment the man was 
startled and then his face filled with 
joy. Showing his empty palms, he 
began to walk slowly toward 
Atanta. 

Atanta moved to meet him, the 
dark fur of his shoulders glistening 



in the moonlight. He spoke, but 
the man did not understand. Then 
he pointed up to the sky, then to 
the man, and tilted his head ques- 
tioningly. 

The man smiled and nodded his 
head. He pointed to the sky, but 
not straight up. He pointed to a 
spot low in the west. 

He pointed to the star of rebirth. 

While Atanta watched in unbe- 
lieving awe, the man touched his 
own chest, then stooped to lay his 
palms on the snow at his feet. Tlien 
he pointed once more to the red 
star and made a rapid upward ges- 
ture. Then he laid his closed hands 
beside his head and pretended to be 
asleep. His fingers opened and 
closed, again and again. “Many 
sleeps,” said Atanta, understanding. 
“Tens of ten sleeps.” 

Smiling, the man straightened 
and made a rapid downward ges- 
ture, ending with his palms again 
on the snow. Then he stepped for- 
ward, placing one hand on his chest, 
the other on Atanta’s. 

The two furry men stood as tall 
and straight as their dignity could 
make them, and their faces were 
bright with joy. Then Atanta took 
the hammerstone out of the binding 
about liis waist, and tossed it into 
the snow. 

The man nodded. Stepping back, 
he lifted his hand in an arc across 
the sky, and offered Atanta the 
stars. END

were fixed upon the golden shape 
which interpreted “The Glory and 
Affirmation of Man” in the Inter- 
World Dance Festival of what 
might have been A. D. 13,582. 

Once again mankind was win- 
ning the contest. Music and dance 
were hypnotic beyond the limits of 
systems, compelling, shocking to hu- 
man and inhuman eyes. The dance 
was a triumph of shock — the shock 
of dynamic beauty. 

The golden shape on the golden 
steps executed shimmering intrica- 
cies of meaning. The body was gold 
and still human. The body was a 
woman, but more than a woman. 
On the golden steps, in the golden 
light, she trembled and fluttered 
like a bird gone mad. 



HE MINISTRY of State Se- 
curity had been positively 
shocked when they found that a 
Nazi agent, more heroic than pru- 
dent, had almost reached N. Rogov. 

Rogov was worth more to the 
Soviet armed forces than any two 
air armies, more than three motor- 
ized divisions. His brain was a 
weapon, a weapon for the Soviet 
power. 

Since the brain was a weapon, 
Rogov was a prisoner. 

He didn’t mind. 

Rogov was a pure Russian type, 
broad-faced, sandy-haired, blue- 
eyed, with whimsy in his smile and 
amusement in the wrinkles at the 
tops of his cheeks. 

“Of course I’m a prisoner,” 
Rogov used to say. “I am a prison- 
er of State service to the Soviet peo- 
ples. But the workers and peasants 

108 



are good to me. I am an academi- 
cian of the All Union Academy of 
Sciences, a major general in the 
Red Air Force, a professor in the 
University of Kharkov, a deputy 
works manager of the Red Flag 
Combat Aircraft Production Trust. 
From each of these I draw a 
salary.” 

Sometimes he would narrow his 
eyes at his Russian scientific col- 
leagues and ask them in dead 
earnest, “Would I serve capital- 
ists?” 

The affrighted colleagues would 
try to stammer their way out of the 
embarrassment, protesting their 
common loyalty to Stalin or Beria, 
or Zhukov, or Molotov, or Bul- 
ganin, as the case may have been. 

Rogov would look very Russian: 
calm, mocking, amused. He would 
let them stammer. 

Then he’d laugh. 

Solemnity transformed into hilar- 
ity, he would explode into bubbling, 
effervescent, good-humored laugh- 
ter: “Of course I could not seive 
the capitalists. My little Anastasia 
would not let me.” 

The colleagues would smile un- 
comfortably and would wish that 
Rogov did not talk so wildly, or so 
comically, or so freely. 

Rogov was afraid of nothing. 
Most of his colleagues were afraid 
of each other, of the Soviet system, 
of the world, of life, and of death. 

Perhaps Rogov had once been 
ordinary and mortal like other peo- 
ple, and full of fears. 

But he had become the lover, the 
colleague, the husband of Anastasia 
Fyodorovna Cherpas. 

Comrade Cherpas had been his 

CORDWAINER SMITH 





rival, his antagonist, his competitor, 
in the struggle for scientific emi- 
nence in the frontiers of Russian 
science. Russian science could never 
overtake the inhuman perfection of 
German method, tlie rigid intellec- 
tual and moral discipline of Ger- 
man teamwork, but the Russians 
could and did get ahead of the Ger- 
mans by giving vent to their bold, 
fantastic imaginations. Rogov had 
pioneered the first rocket launchers 
of 1939. Gherpas had finished the 
job by making the best of the 
rockets radio-directed. 

Rogov in 1942 had developed a 
whole new system of photo-map- 
ping. Comrade Gherpas had ap- 
plied it to color film. Rogov, sandy- 
haired, blue-eyed, and smiling, had 
recorded his criticisms of Comrade 
Cherpas’ naivete and theoretical 
unsoundness at the top-secret meet- 
ings of Russian scientists during the 
black winter nights of 1943. Com- 
rade Cherpas, her butter-yellow 
hair flowing down like living water 
to her shoulders, her unpainted face 
gleaming with fanaticism, intelli- 
gence, and dedication, would snarl 
her own defiance at him, deriding 
his Communist theory, pinching at 
his pride, hitting his hypotheses 
where they were weakest. 

By 1944 a Rogov-Cherpas quar- 
rel had become something worth 
traveling to see. 

In 1945 they were married. 

Their courtship was secret, their 
wedding a surprise, their partner- 
ship a miracle in the upper ranks of 
Russian science. 

The emigre press had reported 
that the great scientist, Peter 
Kapitza, once remarked, “Rogov 

NO, NO, NOT ROGOV! 



and Gherpas, there is a team. 
They’re Communists, good Com- 
munists; but they’re better than 
that! They’re Russian, Russian 
enough to beat the world. Look at 
them. That’s the future, our Rus- 
sian future!” Perhaps the quotation 
was an exaggeration, but it did 
show the enormous respect in which 
both Rogov and Cherpas were held 
by their colleagues in Soviet science. 

Shortly after their marriage 
strange things happened to them. 

Rogov remained happy. Gherpas 
was radiant. 

Nevertheless, the two of them 
began to have haunted expressions, 
as though they had seen things 
which words could not express, as 
though they had stumbled upon 
secrets too important to be whis- 
pered even to the most secure 
agents of the Soviet State Police. 

In 1947 Rogov had an interview 
with Stalin. As he left Stalin’s office 
in the Kremlin, the great leader 
himself came to the door, his fore- 
head wrinkled in thought, nodding, 
“Dfl, da, dar 

Even his own personal staff* did 
not know why Stalin was saying 
“Yes, yes, yes,” but they did see the 
orders that went forth marked 
ONLY BY SAFE HAND, and TO 
BE READ AND RETURNED, 
NOT RETAINED, and further- 
more stamped FOR AUTHOR- 
IZED EYES ONLY AND UN- 
DER NO CIRCUMSTANCES 
TO BE COPIED. 

Into the true and secret Soviet 
budget that year by the direct per- 
sonal orders of a noncommittal 
Stalin, an item was added for 
“Project Telescope.” Stalin toler- 

109 




ated no inquiry, brooked no com- 
ment. 

A village which had had a name 
became nameless. 

A forest which had been opened 
to the workers and peasants became 
military territory. 

Into the central post office in 
Kharkov there went a new box 
number for the village of Ya, Ch. 

Rogov and Cherpas, comrades 
and lovers, scientists both and Rus- 
sians both, disappeared from the 
everyday lives of their colleagues. 
Their faces were no longer seen at 
scientific meetings. Only rarely did 
they emerge. 

On the few occasions they were 
seen. Usually going to and from 
Moscow at the time the All Union 
budget was made up each year, 
they seemed smiling and happy. But 
they did not make jokes. 

What the outside world did not 
know was that Stalin in giving them 
their own project, granting them 
a paradise restricted to themselves, 
had seen to it that a snake went 
with them in the paradise. The 
snake this time was not one, but 
two personalities — Gausgofer and 
Gauck. 



TALIN DIED. 

Beria died too — less willingly. 

The world went on. 

Everything went into the forgot- 
ten village of Ya. Gh. and nothing 
came out. 

It was rumored that Khrushchev 
himself visited Rogov and Cherpas. 
It was even whispered that Khrush- 
chev said as he went to the Kharkov 
airport to fly back to Moscow, “It’s 



t>ig 5 big, big. There’ll be no cold 
war if they do it. There won’t be 
any war of any kind. We’ll finish 
capitalism before the capitalists can 
ever begin to fight. If they do it. If 
they do it.” Khrushchev was re- 
ported to have shaken his head 
slowly in perplexity and to have 
said nothing more but to have put 
his initials on the unmodified 
budget of Project Telescope when a 
trusted messenger next brought him 
an envelope from Rogov. 

Anastasia Cherpas became a 
mother. Their first boy looked like 
the father. He was followed by a 
little girl. Then another little boy. 
The children didn’t stop Cherpas’ 
work. The family had a large dacha 
and trained nursemaids took over 
the household. 

Every night the four of them 
dined together. 

Rogov, Russian, humorous, cou- 
rageous, amused. 

Cherpas, older, more mature, 
more beautiful than ever, but just 
as biting, just as cheerful, just as 
sharp as she had ever been. 

But then the other two, two who 
sat with them across the years of 
all their days, the two colleagues 
who had been visited upon them by 
the all-powerful word of Stalin 
himself. 

Gausgofer was a female: blood- 
less, narrow-faced, with a voice like 
a horse’s whinny. She was a scientist 
and a police woman, and com- 
petent at both jobs. In 1920 she had 
reported her own mother’s where- 
abouts to the Bolshevik Terror 
Committee. In 1924 she had com- 
manded her father’s execution. He 
was a Russian German of the old 



no 



CORDWAINER SMITH 




Baltic nobility and he had tried to 
adjust his mind to the new system, 
but he had failed. In 1930 she had 
let her lover trust her a little too 
much. He was a Rumanian Com- 
munist, very high in the Party, but 
he had a sneaking sympathy for 
Trotsky. When he whispered into 
her ear in the privacy of their bed- 
room, whispered with the tears 
pouring down his face, she had lis- 
tened affectionately and quietly and 
had delivered his words to the 
police the next morning. 

With that she came to Stalin’s 
attention. 

Stalin had been tough. He ad- 
dressed her brutally, “Comrade, you 
have some brains. I can see you 
know what Communism is all 
about. You understand loyalty. 
You’re going to get ahead and serve 
the Party and the working class, but 
is that all you want?” He had spat 
the question at her. 

She was so astonished that she 
gaped. 

The old man had changed his ex- 
pression, favoring her with leering 
benevolence. He had put his fore- 
finger on her chest, “Study science. 
Comrade. Study science. Commun- 
ism plus science equals victory. 
You’re too clever to stay in police 
work.” 

Gausgofer fell in love with Rogov 
the moment she saw him. 

Gausgofer fell in hate — and hate 
can be as spontaneous and miracu- 
lous as love — with Cherpas the mo- 
ment she saw her. 

But Stalin had guessed that too. 

With the bloodless, fanatic Gaus- 
gofer he had sent a man named B. 
Gauck. 



Gauck was solid, impassive, 
blank-faced. In body he was about 
the same height as Rogov. Where 
Rogov was muscular, Gauck was 
flabby. Where Rogov’s skin was fair 
and shot through with the pink 
and health of exercise, Gauck’s skin 
was like stale lard, greasy, gray- 
green, sickly even on the best of 
days. 

Gauck’s eyes were black and 
small. His glance was as cold and 
sharp as death. Gauck had no 
friends, no enemies, no beliefs, no 
enthusiasms. 

Gauck never drank, never went 
out, never received mail, never sent 
mail, never spoke a spontaneous 
word. He was never rude, never 
kind, never friendly, never really 
withdrawn: He couldn’t withdraw 
any more than the constant with- 
drawal of all his life. 

Rogov had turned to his wife in 
the secrecy of their bedroftm soon 
after Gausgofer and Gauck came 
and had said, “Anastasia, is that 
man sane?” 

Cherpas intertwined the fingers 
of her beautiful, expressive hands. 
She who had been the wit of a 
thousand scientific meetings was 
now at a loss for words. She looked 
up at her husband with a troubled 
expression. “I don’t know, com- 
rade ... I just don’t know.” 

Rogov smiled his amused Slavic 
smile. “At the least then I don’t 
think Gausgofer knows either.” 

Cherpas snorted with laughter 
and picked up her hairbrush. 
“That she doesn’t. She really 
doesn’t know, does she? I’ll wager 
she doesn’t even know to whom he 
reports.” 



NO, NO, NOT ROGOV! 



Ill 




That conversation had reached 
into the past. Gauck, Gausgofer, 
bloodless eyes and the black eyes — 
they remained. 

Every dinner the four sat down 
together. 

Every morning the four met in 
the laboratory. 

Rogov’s great courage, high 
sanity, and keen humor kept the 
work going. 

Cherpas’ flashing genius fueled 
him whenever the routine over- 
loaded his magnificent intellect. 

Gausgofer spied and watched 
and smiled her bloodless smiles; 
sometimes, curiously enough, Gaus- 
gofer made genuinely constructive 
suggestions. She never understood 
the whole frame of reference of 
their work, but she knew enough 
of the mechanical and engineering 
details to be very useful on occa- 
sion. 

Gauck came in, sat down quietly, 
said nothing, did nothing. He did 
not even smoke. He never fidgeted. 
He never went to sleep. He just 
watched. 

The laboratory grew and with it 
there grew the immense configura- 
tion of the espionage machine. 

I N THEORY what Rogov had 
proposed and Cherpas seconded 
was imaginable. It consisted of an 
attempt to work out an integrated 
theory for all the electrical and 
radiadon phenomena accompany- 
ing consciousness, and to duplicate 
the electrical funcdons of mind 
without the use of animal material. 

The range of potential products 
was immense. 



The first product Stalin had 
asked for was a receiver, if possible, 
one capable of tuning in the 
thoughts of a human mind and of 
translating those thoughts either 
into a punch tape machine, an 
adapted German Hellschreiber ma- 
chine, or phonetic speech. If the 
grids could be turned around, the 
brain-equivalent machine as a 
transmitter might be able to send 
out stunning forces which would 
paralyze or kill the process of 
thought. 

At its best, Rogov’s machine was 
designed to confuse human thought 
over great distances, to select hu- 
man targets to be confused, and to 
maintain an electronic jamming 
system which would jam straight 
into the human mind without the 
requirement of tubes or receivers. 

He had succeeded — in part. He 
had given himself a violent head- 
ache in the first year of work. 

In the third year he had killed 
mice at a distance of ten kilometers. 
In the seventh year he had brought 
on mass hallucinations and a wave 
of suicides in a neighboring village. 
It was this which impressed Khrush- 
chev. 

Rogov was now working on the 
receiver end. No one had ever ex- 
plored the infinitely narrow, in- 
finitely subtle bands of radiation 
which distinguished one human 
mind from another, but Rogov was 
trying, as it were, to tune in on 
minds far away. 

He had tried to develop a tele- 
pathic helmet of some kind, but it 
did not work. He had then turned 
away from the reception of pure 
thought to the reception of visual 



112 



CORDWAINER SMITH 




and auditory images. Where the 
nerve-ends reached the brain itself, 
he had managed over the years to 
distinguish whole packets of micro- 
phenomena, and on some of these 
he had managed to get a fix. 

With infinitely delicate tuning he 
had succeeded one day in picking 
up the eyesight of their second 
chauffeur, and had managed, 
thanks to a needle thrust in just 
below liis own riglit eyelid, to “see” 
through the other man's eyes as tlie 
other man, all unaware, washed 
their Zis limousine sikteen hundred 
meters away. 

. Cherpas had surpassed his feat 
later that winter, and had managed 
to bring in an entire family having 
dinner over in a nearby city. She 
had invited B. Gauck to have a 
needle inserted into his cheekbone 
so that he could see with the eyes 
of an unsuspecting spied-on stran- 
ger. Gauck had refused any kind 
of needles, but Gausgofer had 
joined in the experiment and had 
expressed her satisfaction with the 
work. 

The espionage machine was be- 
ginning to take form. 

Two more steps remained. The 
first step consisted of tuning in on 
some remote target, such as the 
White House in Washington or the 
NATO Headquarters outside Paris. 

The second problem consisted of 
finding a method of jamming tho.se 
minds at a distance, stunning them 
so that the subject personnel fell 
into tears, confusion, or insanity. 

Rogov had tried, but he had 
never gotten more than thirty kilo- 
meters from the nameless village of 
Ya. Ch. 



One November there had been 
seventy cases of hysteria, most of 
them ending in suicide, down in 
the city of Kharkov several hun- 
dred kilometers away, but Rogov 
was not sure that his own machine 
was doing it. 

Comrade Gausgofer dared to 
stroke his sleeve. Her white lips 
smiled and her watery eyes grew 
liappy as she said in her high, cruel 
voice, “Tow can do it, comrade. 
You can do it.” 

Cherpas looked on with con- 
tempt. Gauck said nothing. 

The female agent Gausgofer saw 
Cherpas’ eyes upon her, and for a 
moment an arc of living hatred 
leaped between the two women. 

The three of them went back 
to work on the machine. 

Gauck sat on his stool and 
watched them. 



I T WAS the year in which Eris- 
tratov died that the machinfe 
made a breakthrough. Eristratov 
died after the Soviet and People’s 
democracies had tried to end the 
cold war with the Americans. 

It was May. Outside the labora- 
tory the squirrels ran among the 
trees. The leftovers from the night’s 
rain dripped on the ground and 
kept the earth moist. It was com- 
fortable to leave a few windows 
open and to let the smell of the 
forest into the workshop. 

The smell of their oil-burning 
heaters, the stale smell of insula- 
tion, of ozone, and of the heated 
electronic gear was something with 
which all of them were much too 
familiar. 



NO, NO, NOT ROGOV! 



113 




Rogov had found that his eye- 
sight was beginning to suffer be- 
cause he had to get the receiver 
needle somewhere near his optic 
nerve in order to obtain visual im- 
pressions from the machine. After 
months of experimentation with 
both animal and human subjects he 
had decided to copy one of their 
last experiments, successfully per- 
formed on a prisoner boy fifteen 
years of age, by having the needle 
slipped directly through the skull, 
up and behind the eye. Rogov had 
disliked using prisoners, because 
Gauck, speaking on behalf of se- 
curity, always insisted that a pris- 
oner used in experiments be de- 
stroyed in not less than five days 
from the beginning of the experi- 
ment. Rogov had satisfied himself 
that the skull-and-needle technique 
was safe, but he was very tired of 
trying to get frightened, unscien- 
tific people to carry the load of in- 
tense, scientific attentiveness re- 
quired by the machine. 

Somewhat ill-humored, he shout- 
ed at Gauck, “Have you ever 
known what this is all about? 
You’ve been here years. Do you 
know what we’re trying to do? 
Don’t you ever want to take part 
in the experiments yourself? Do 
you realize how many years of 
mathematics have gone into the 
making of these grids and the cal- 
culation of these wave patterns? 
Are you good for anything?” 

Gauck had said, tunelessly and 
without anger, “Comrade profes- 
sor, I am obeying orders. You are 
obeying orders too. I’ve never im- 
peded you.” 

Rogov raved, “I know you never 
114 



got in my way. We’re all good serv- 
ants of the Soviet State. It’s not a 
question of loyalty. It’s a question 
of enthusiasm. Don’t you ever want 
to glimpse the science we’re mak- 
ing? We are a hundred years or a 
thousand years ahead of the capi- 
talist Americans. Doesn’t that ex- 
cite you? Aren’t you a human be- 
ing? Why don’t you take part? 
How will you understand me when 
I explain it?” 

Gauck said nothing; he looked 
at Rogov with his beady eyes. His 
dirty-gray face did not change ex- 
pression. Gherpas said, “Go ahead, 
Nikolai. The comrade can follow 
if he wants to.” 

Gausgofer looked enviously at 
Gherpas. She seemed inclined to 
keep quiet, but then had to speak. 
She said, “Do go ahead, comrade 
professor.” 

Said Rogov, ‘^Kharosho, I’ll do 
what I can. The machine is now 
ready to receive minds over im- 
mense distances.” He wrinkled his 
lip in amused scorn. “We may even 
spy into the brain of the chief ras- 
cal himself and find out what 
Eisenhower is planning to do today 
against the Soviet people. Wouldn’t 
it be wonderful if our machine 
could stun him and leave him sit- 
ting addled at his desk?” 

Gauck commented, “Don’t try it. 
Not without orders.” 

Rogov ignored the interruption 
and went on. “First I receive. I 
don’t know what I will get, who I 
will get, or where they will be. All 
I know is that this machine will 
reach out across all the minds of 
men and beasts now living and it 
will bring the eyes and ears of a 

CORDWAINER SMITH 




single mind directly into mine. 
With the new needle going directly 
into the brain it will be possible for 
me to get a very sharp fixation of 
position. The trouble with that boy 
last week was that even though we 
knew he was seeing something out- 
side this room, he appeared to be 
getting sounds in a foreign lan- 
guage and did not know enough 
English or German to realize where 
or what the machine had taken him 
to see.” 

Gherpas laughed, “Fm not wor- 
ried. I saw then it was safe. You go 
first, my husband. If our comrades 
don’t mind — ?” 

Gauck nodded. 

Gausgofer lifted her bony hand 
breathlessly to her skinny throat 
and said, “Of course. Comrade 
Rogov, of course. You did all the 
work. You must be the first.” 

Rogov sat down. 

A white-smocked technician 
brought the machine over to him. 
It was mounted on three rubber- 
tired wheels and it resembled the 
small X-ray units used by dentists. 
In place of the cone at the head 
of the X-ray machine there was a 
long, incredibly tough needle. It 
had been made for them by the best 
surgical steel craftsmen in Prague. 

Another technician came up with 
a shaving bowl, a brush, and a 
straight razor. Under the gaze of 
Gauck’s deadly eyes he shaved an 
area of four square centimeters on 
the top of Rogov’s liead. 

Cherpas herself then took over. 
She set her husband’s head in the 
clamp and used a micrometer to 
get the skull-fittings so tight and so 
accurate that the nee^e would 

"NO, NO, NOT ROGOV! 



push through the dura mater at ex- 
actly the right point. 

All this work she did deftly with 
kind, very strong fingers. She was 
gentle, but she was firm. She was 
his wife, but she was also his fellow 
scientist and his colleague in the 
Soviet State. 

She stepped back and looked at 
her work. She gave him one of 
their own very special smiles, the 
secret gay smiles which they usually 
exchanged with each other only 
when they were alone. “You won’t 
want to do this every day. We’re 
going to have to find some way of 
getting into the brain without using 
this needle. But it won’t hurt you.” 
“Does it matter if it does hurt?” 
said Rogov. “This is the triumph 
of all our work. Bring it downf^ 
Cherpas, her eyes gleaming with 
attention, reached over and pulled 
down the handle which brought the 
tough needle to within a tenth of a 
millimeter of the right place. 

Rogov spoke very carefully: “All 
I felt was a little sting. You can 
turn the power on now.” 

Gausgofer could not contain her- 
self. Timidly she addressed Cher- 
pas, '‘May I turn on the power?” 
Cherpas nodded. Gauck watched. 
Rogov waited. Gausgofer pulled 
down the bayonet switch. 

The power went on. 

With an impatient twist of her 
hand, Anastasia Gherpas ordered 
the laboratory attendants to the 
other end of the room. Two or 
three of them had stopped working 
and were staring at Rogov, staring 
like dull sheep. They looked em- 
barrassed and then they huddled 
in a white-smocked herd at the 



115 




other end of the laboratory. 

The wet May wind blew in on 
all of them. The scent of forest 
and leaves was about them. 

The three watched Rogov. 

Rogov’s complexion began to 
change. His face became flushed. 
His breathing was so loud and 
heavy they could hear it several 
meters away. Cherpas fell on her 
knees in front of him, eyebrows 
lifted in mute inquiry. 

Rogov did not dare nod, not with 
a needle in his brain. He spoke 
through flushed lips, spesiking 
thickly and heavily, “Do — not — 
stop — now.” 

Rogov himself did not know 
what was happening. He had 
thought he might see an American 
room, or a Russian room, or a 
tropical colony. He might see palm 
trees, or forests, or desks. He might 
see guns or buildings, washrooms 
or beds, hospitals, homes, churches. 
He might see with the eyes of a 
child, a woman, a man, a soldier, a 
philosopher, a slave, a worker, a 
savage, a religious, a Communist, 
a reactionary, a governor, a police- 
man. He might hear voices ; he 
might hear English, or French, or 
Russian, Swahili, Hindi, Malay, 
Chinese, Ukrainian, Armenian, 
Turkish, Greek. He did not know. 

None of tliese things had hap- 
pened. 

It seemed to him that he had 
left the world, that he had left 
time. The hours and the centuries 
shrank up like the meters, and the 
machine, unchecked, reached out 
for the most powerful signal which 
any human mind had transmitted. 

116 



Rogov did not know it, but the ma- 
chine had conquered time. 

The machine had reached the 
dance, the human challenger and 
the dance festival of the year that 
might have been A.D. 13,582. 

Before Rogov’s eyes the golden 
shape and the golden steps shook 
and fluttered in a ritual a thousand 
times more compelling than hyj>- 
notism. The rhythms meant noth- 
ing and everything to him. This 
was Russia, this was Communism. 
This was his life — indeed it was his 
soul acted out before his very eyes. 

For a second, the last second 
of his ordinary life, he looked 
through flesh and blood eyes and 
saw the shabby woman whom he 
had once thought beautiful. He 
saw Anastasia Cherpas, and he did 
not care. 

His vision concentrated once 
again on the dancing image, this 
woman, those postures, that dance! 

Then the sound came in — music 
that would have made a Tschaikov- 
sky weep, orchestras which would 
have silenced Shostakovich or 
Khachaturian forever. 

The people- who- were-not-people 
between the stars had taught man- 
kind many arts. Rogov’s mind was 
the best of its time, but his time 
was far, far behind the time of the 
great dance. With that one vision 
Rogov went firmly and completely 
mad. 

He became blind to the sight of 
Cherpas, Gausgofer, and Gauck. 
He forgot the village of Ya. Ch. 
He forgot himself. He was like a 
fish, bred in stale fresh water, which 
is thrown for the first time into a 
living stream. He was like an in- 

CORDWAINER SMITO 




sect emerging from the chrysalis. 
His twentieth-century mind could 
not hold the imagery and, the im- 
pact of the music and the dance. 

But the needle was there and 
the needle transmitted into his 
mind more than his mind could 
stand. 

The synapses of his brain flicked 
like switches. The future flooded 
into him. 

He fainted. 

Gherpas leaped forward and 
lifted the needle. Rogov fell out of 
the chair. 



I T WAS Gauck who got the doc- 
tors. By nightfall they had Ro- 
gov resting comfortably and under 
heavy sedation. There were two 
doctors, both from the military 
headquarters. Gauck had obtained 
authorization for their services by 
a direct telephone call to Moscow. 

Both the doctors were annoyed. 
The senior one never stopped 
grumbling at Gherpas. 

“You should not have done it, 
Gomrade Gherpas. Gomrade Rogov 
^ould not have done it either. 
You can’t go around sticking things 
into brains. That’s a medical prob- 
lem. None of you people are doc- 
tors of medicine. It’s all right for 
you to contrive devices with the 
prisoners, but you can’t inflict 
things like this on Soviet scientific 
personnel. I’m going to get blamed 
because I can’t bring Rogov back. 
You heard what he was saying. All 
he did was mutter, ‘That golden 
shape on the golden steps, that mu- 
sic, that me is a true me, that 
golden shape, that golden shape, I 

NO, NO, NOT ROGOV! 



want to be with that golden shape,’ 
and rubbish like that. Maybe 
you’ve ruined a first-class brain 
forever — ’ He stopped short as 
though he had said too much. 
After all, the problem was a se- 
curity problem and apparently 
both Gauck and Gausgofer repre- 
sented the security agencies. 

Gausgofer turned her watery 
eyes on the doctor and said in a 
low, even, unbelievably poisonous 
voice, “Gould she have done it, 
comrade doctor?’' 

The doctor looked at Gherpas, 
answering Gausgofer, “How? You 
were there. I wasn’t. How could 
she have done it? Why should she 
do it? You were there.’' 

Gherpas said nothing. Her lips 
were compressed tight with grirf. 
Her yellow hair gleamed, but her 
hair was all that remained, at that 
moment, of her beauty. She was 
frightened and she was getting 
ready to be sad. She had no time 
to hate foolish women or to worry 
about security; she was concerned 
with her colleague, her lover, her 
husband Rogov. 

There was nothing much for 
them to do except to wail. They 
went into a large room and waited. 

The servants had laid out im- 
mense dishes of cold sliced meat, 
pots of caviar, and an assortment 
of sliced breads, pure butter, genu- 
ine coffee, and liquors. 

None of them ate much. At 9: 15 
the sound of rotors beat against the 
house. The big helicoptor had ar- 
rived from Moscow. 

Higher authorities took over. 

The higher authority was a dep- 



117 




uty minister, a man named V. 
Karper. 

Karper was accompanied by two 
or three uniformed colonels, by an 
engineer civilian, by a man from 
the headquarters of the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union, and by 
two doctors. 

They dispensed with the cour- 
tesies. Karper merely said, “You 
are Gherpas. I have met you. You 
are Gausgofer. I have seen your re- 
ports. You are Gauck.” 

The delegation went into Ro- 
gov’s bedroom. Karper snapped, 
“Wake him.” 

The military doctor who had 
given him sedatives said, “Com- 
rade, you mustn’t — ” 

Karper cut him off. “Shut up.” 
He turned to his own physician, 
pointed at Rogov. “Wake him up.” 

The doctor from Moscow talked 
briefly with the senior military doc- 
tor. He too began shaking his head. 
He gave Karper a disturbed look. 
Karper guessed what he might 
hear. He said, “Go ahead. I know 
there is some danger to the patient, 
but I’ve got to get back to Moscow 
with a report.” 

The two doctors worked over 
Rogov. One of them gave Rogov 
an injection. Then all of them 
stood back from the bed. 

Rogov writhed in his bed. He 
squirmed. His eyes opened, but he 
did not see the people. With child- 
ishly clear and simple words Rogov 
began to talk, “. that golden 
shape, the golden stairs, the music, 
take me back to the music, I want 
to be with the music, I really am 
the music ...” and so on in an 
endless monotone. 



Gherpas leaned over him so that 
her face was directly in his line of 
vision. “My darling! My darling, 
wake up. This is serious.” 

It was evident to all of them that 
Rogov did not hear her. 

For the first time in many years 
Gauck took the initiative. He spoke 
directly to the man from Moscow. 
“Comrade, may I make a sugges- 
tion?” 

Karper looked at him. Gauck 
nodded at Gausgofer. “We were 
both sent here by orders of Com- 
rade Stalin. She is senior. She bears 
the responsibility. All I do is double 
check.” 

The deputy minister turned to 
Gausgofer. Gausgofer had been 
staring at Rogov on the bed; her 
blue, watery eyes were tearless and 
her face was drawn into an expres- 
sion of extreme tension. 

Karper ignored that and said to 
her firmly; dearly, commandingly, 
“What do you recommend?” 

Gausgofer looked at him very di- 
rectly and said in a measured voice, 
“I do not think that the case is one 
of brain damage. I believe that he 
has obtained a communication 
which he must share with another 
human being and that unless one of 
us follows him there may be no 
answer.” 

Karper barked: “Very well. But 
what do we do?” 

“Let me follow — into the ma- 
chine.” 

Anastasia Gherpas began to 
laugh slyly and frantically. She 
seized Karper’s arm and p>ointed 
her finger at Gausgofer. Karper 
stared at her. 

Gherpas restrained her laughter

and shouted at Karper, “The wom- 
an’s mad. She has loved my hus- 
band for many years. She has hated 
my presence, and now she thinks 
that she can save him. She thinks 
that she can follow. She thinks that 
he wants to communicate with her. 
That’s ridiculous. I will go myself!” 

Karper looked about. He selected 
two of his staff and stepped over 
into a corner of the room. They 
could hear him talking, but they 
could not distinguish the words. 
After a conference of six or seven 
minutes he returned. 

“You people have been making 
serious security charges against 
each other. I find that one of our 
finest weapons, the mind of Rogov, 
is damaged. Rogov’s not just a 
man. He is a Soviet project.” Scorn 
entered his voice. “I find that the 
senior security officer, a policewom- 
an with a notable record, is charged 
by another Soviet scientist with a 
silly infatuation. I disregard such 
charges. The development of the 
Soviet State and the work of Soviet 
science cannot be impeded by per- 
sonalities. Comrade Gausgofer will 
follow. I am acting tonight because 
my own staff physician says that 
Rogov may not live and it is very 
important for us to find out just 
what has happened to him and 
why.” 

He turned his baleful gaze on 
Gherpas. “You will not protest, 
comrade. Your mind is the prop- 
erty of the Russian State. Your life 
and your education have been paid 
for by the workers. You cannot 
throw these things away because of 
personal sentiment. If there is any- 
thing to be found, Comrade Gaus- 

NO, NO, NOT ROGOV! 



gofer will find it for both of us.” 

The whole group of them went 
back into the laboratory. The 
frightened technicians were brought 
over from the barracks. The lights 
were turned on and the windows 
were closed. The May wind had 
become chilly. 

The needle was sterilized. The 
electronic grids were warmed up. 

Gausgofer’s face was an impas- 
sive mask of triumph as she sat in 
the receiving chair. She smiled at 
Gauck as an attendant brought the 
soap and the razor to shave clean 
a patch on her scalp. 

Gauck did not smile back. His 
black eyes stared at her. He said 
nothing. He did nothing. He 
watched. 

Karper walked to and fro, glanc- 
ing from time to time at the hasty 
but orderly preparation of the ex- 
periment. 

Anastasia Gherpas sat down at a 
laboratory table about five meters 
away from the group. She watched 
the back of Gausgofer’s head as 
the needle was lowered. She buried 
her face in her hands. Some of the 
others thought they heard her 
weeping, but no one heeded Gher- 
pas very much. They were too in- 
tent on watching Gausgofer. 

Gausgofer’s face became red. 
Perspiration poured down the 
flabby cheeks. Her fingers tightened 
on the arm of her chair. 

Suddenly she shouted at them, 
''That golden shape on the golden 
steps/’ 

She leaped to her feet, dragging 
the apparatus with her. 

No one had expected this. The 
chair fell to the floor. The needle 



119 




holder, lifted from the floor, swung 
its weight sidewise. The needle 
twisted like a scythe in Gausgofer’s 
brain. 

The body of Gausgofer lay on 
the floor, surrounded by excited 
ofHcials. 

Karper was acute enough to look 
around at Gherpas. 

She stood up from the laboratory 
table and walked toward him. A 
thin line of blood flowed down 
from her cheekbone. Another line 
of blood dripped down from a posi- 
tion on her cheek, one and a half 
centimers forward of the opening 
of her left ear. 

With tremendous composure, her 
face as white as fresh snow, she 
smiled at him. ‘T eavesdropp^.” 
Karper said, “What?” 

“I eavesdropped, eavesdropped,” 
repeated Anastasia Gherpas. “I 
found out where my husband has 
gone. It is not somewhere in this 
world. It is something hypnotic be- 
yond all the limitations of our sci- 
ence. We have made a great gun, 
but the gun has fired upon us be- 
fore we could fire it. 

“Project Telescope is finished. 
You may try to get someone else to 
finish it, but you will not.” 

Karper stared at her and then 
turned aside. 

Gauck stood in his way. 

“What do you want?” 

“To teU you,” said Gauck very 
sofdy, “to tell you, comrade deputy 
minister, that Rogov is gone as she 
says he is gone, that she is finished 
if she says she is finished, that all 
this is true. I know.” 

Karper glared at him. “How do 
you know?” 

120 



Gauck remained utterly impas- 
sive. With superhuman assurance 
and calm he said to Karper, “Com- 
rade, I do not dispute the matter. 
I know these people, though I do 
not know their science. Rogov is 
done for.” 

At last Karper believed him. 

They all looked at Anastasia 
Gherpas, at her beautiful hair, her 
determined blue eyes, and the two 
thin lines of blood. 

Karper turned to her. “What do 
we do now?” 

For an answer she dropped to her 
knees and began sobbing, “No, no, 
not Rogov! No, no, not Rogov!” 

And that was all that they could 
get out of her. Gauck looked on. 

On the golden steps in the golden 
light, a golden shape danced a 
dream beyond the limits of all 
imagination, danced and drew the 
music to herself until a sigh of 
yearning, yearning which became a 
hope and a torment, went through 
the hearts of living things on a 
thousand worlds. 

Edges of the golden scene faded 
raggedly and unevenly into black. 
The gold dimmed down to a pale 
gold-silver sheen and then to silver, 
last of all to white. The dancer who 
had been golden was now a forlorn 
white-pink figure standing, quiet 
and fatigued, on the immense, white 
steps. The applause of a thousand 
worlds roared in upon her. 

She looked blindly at them. The 
dance had overwhelmed her, too. 
Their applause could mean noth- 
ing. The dance was an end in itself. 
She would have to live, somehow, 
until she danced again. END
