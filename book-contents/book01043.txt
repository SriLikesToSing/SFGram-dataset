W HEN he saw her again, 
he all but yelled — a 
wordless, painful bleat, 
one concentrated syllable to con- 
tain five years of loneliness, fury, 
self-revilement and that agony 
peculiar to the victim of “the 
other man.” Yet he controlled it, 
throwing it with a practiced reflex 
to a tensing of his abdomen and 
the transient knotting of thigh 
muscles behind the desk, letting 
the impact strike as it should, un- 
seen. 

Outwardly, he was controlled. 
It was his job to know the lan- 
guage of eyelids, jaw muscles, lips, 
and it was his special skill to 
make them mute. He rose slowly 
as his nurse ushered her in and 
while she took the three short 
paces to meet him. He studied her 
with an impassive ferocity. 

He might have imagined her in 
old clothes, or in cheap clothes. 
Here she was in clothes which 
were both. He had allowed, in his 
thoughts of her, for change, but 
he had not thought her nose might 
have been broken, nor that she 
might be so frighteningly thin. He 
had thought she would always 
walk like something wild . free, 
rather . but with stateliness, too, 
balanced and fine. And indeed she 
still did so; somehow that hurt 
him more than anything else 
could. 

She stopped before the desk. 
He moved his hands behind him;

It was wholly, shockingly Impossible

THE OTHER MAN 



S 






her gaze was on them and he 
wanted her to look up. He waited 
until Miss Jarrell discreetly 
clicked the door shut. 

“Osa,” he said at last. 

“Well, Fred.” 

T HE silence became painful. 

How long did that take — two 
seconds, three? He made a mean- 
ingless sound, part of a laugh, and 
came around the desk to shift the 
chair beside it. “Sit down, for 
heaven’s sake.” 

She sat down and abruptly, for 
the first time since she had en- 
tered the office, she looked directly 
at him. “You look — you look well, 
Fred.” 

“Thanks.” He sat down. He 
wanted to say something, but the 
only thing that would come read- 
ily to his lips was, “You’re looking 
well, too”— such a patent lie that 
he couldn’t tell it. And at last he 
found something else to say: “A 
lot has happened.” 

She nodded and her gaze found 
a corner of the tooled-leather 
blotter frame on the desk. She 
studied it quietly. 

“Five years,” she said. 

Five years in which she must 
have known everything about 
him, at first because such a sepa- 
ration is never sharp, but ragged, 
raveled, a-crackle with the differ- 
ent snaps of different threads at 
different times; and later, because 
all the world knew what he was, 

6 



what he had done. What he stood 
for. 

For him, five years at first filled 
with a not-Osa, like a sheet of 
paper from which one has cut a sil- 
houette; and after that, the dimi- 
nishing presence of Osa as gossip 
(so little of that, because anyone 
directly involved in gossip walks 
usually in a bubble of silence); 
Osa as rumor, Osa as conjecture. 
He had heard that Richard New- 
ell had lost — left — his job about 
the time he had won Osa, and he 
had never heard of him working 
again. 

Glancing at Osa’s cheap clothes 
now, and the new small lines in 
her face, he concluded that what- 
ever Newell had found to do, it 
could not have been much. New- 
ell, he thought bitterly, is a man 
God made with only one victory 
in him and he’s used it up. 

“Will you help me?” Osa asked 
stridently. 

He thought. Was I waiting for 
this? Is this some sort of reward, 
her coming to me for help? Once 
he might have thought so. At the 
moment, he did not feel rewarded. 

He sat looking at her question 
as if it were a tangible object, a 
box of a certain size, a certain 
shape, made of some special ma- 
terial, which was not to be opened 
until he had guessed its contents. 

Will you help me? Money? 
Hardly — Osa may have lost a 
great deal, but her towering pride 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was still with her. Besides, money 
settles nothing. A little is never 
enough and helps only until it is 
gone. A little more puts real solu- 
tions a bit further into the future. 
A whole lot buries the real prob- 
lem, where it lives like a cancer 
or a carcinogen. 

Not money, then. Perhaps a 
job? For her? No, he knew her 
well. She could get her own jobs. 
She had not, therefore she didn’t 
want one. This could only mean 
she lived as she did for Newell’s 
sake. Oh, yes, he would be the 
provider, even if the illusion 
starved her. 

Then a job for Newell? Didn’t 
she know he couldn’t be trusted 
with any responsible job and was 
not constituted to accept any- 
thing less? Of course she knew it. 

All of which left only one thing. 
She must be sure, too, that Newell 
would accept the idea or she 
would not be here asking. 

He said, “How soon can he start 
therapy?” 

CHE flickered, all over and all 
^ at once, as if he had touched 
her with a high voltage electrode 
— the first and only indication she 
had evinced of the terrible ten- 
sions she carried. Then she raised 
her head, her face lit with some- 
thing beyond words, something 
big enough, bright enough, to light 
and warm the world. His world. 
She tried to speak. 



“Don’t,” he whispered. He put 
out his hand and then withdrew 
it. “You’ve already said it.” 

She turned her head away and 
tried to say something else, but he 
overrode that, too. 

“I’ll get paid,” he said bluntly. 
“After his therapy, he’ll earn more 
than enough—” (For both of us? 
For my bill? To pay you back for 
all he’s done to you? ) for 
everything.” 

“I should have known,” she 
breathed. He understood. She had 
been afraid he wouldn’t take New- 
ell as a patient. She had been 
afraid, if he did take him, that he 
might insist on doing it free, the 
name of which was charity. She 
need not have worried. I should 
have known. Any response to 
that, from a shrug to a disclaimer, 
would destroy a delicacy, so he 
said nothing. 

“He can come any time you 
say,” she told him. This meant, 
He isn’t doing anything these 
days. 

He opened a desk book and 
riffled through it. He did not see 
it. He said, “I’d like to do some 
pretty intensive work with him. 
Six, eight weeks.” 

“You mean he’d stay here?” 

He nodded. “And I’m afraid — 
I’d prefer that you didn’t visit 
him. Do you mind very much?” 
She hesitated. “Are you sure 
that . .” Her voice trailed off. 
“I’m sure I want to do it,” he 



THE OTHER MAN

said, suddenly rough. “I’m sure I’ll 
do everything I can to straighten 
him out, bar nothing. You wouldn’t 
want me to say I was sure of 
anything else.” 

She got to her feet. “I’ll call 
you, Fred.” She watched his face 
for a moment. He did not know 
if she would want to shake his 
hand or — or not. She took one 
deep breath, then turned away 
and went to the door and opened 
it. 

“Thank you . .” 

He sat down and looked at the 
closed door. She had worn no 
scent, but he was aware of her 
aura in the room, anyway. 
Abruptly he realized that she had 
not said ‘Thank you.” 

He had. 

O SA didn’t call. Three days, 
four, the phone ringing and 
ringing, and never her voice. Then 
it didn’t matter — rather, she had 
no immediate reason to call, be- 
cause the intercom whispered, and 
when he keyed it, it said in Miss 
Jarrell’s clear tones, “A Mr. New- 
ell to see you, Doctor.” 

Stupidly he said, “Richard A. 
Newell?” 

Bzz Pssa Bzz. “That’s right, 
Doctor.” 

“Send him in.” 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“Send him in,” said the doctor. I 
thought that’s what I said. What 
did it sound like? He couldn’t re- 

s 



member. He cleared his throat 
painfully. Newell came in. 

“We-ell, Freddy-boy.” (Two 
easy paces; cocked head, half 
smile.) “A small world.” Without 
waiting to be asked, he sat down 
in the big chair at the end of the 
desk. 

At first glance, he had not 
changed; and then the doctor 
realized that it was the — what 
word would do? — the symphonic 
quality of the man, the air of per- 
fect blending — it was that which 
had not changed. 

Newell’s diction had always 
suited the clothes he chose and 
his movements were as controlled 
as his speech. He still wore ex- 
pensive clothes, but they were 
years old — yet so good they 
hardly showed it. The doctor was 
immediately aware that under the 
indestructible creases and folds 
was a lining almost certainly 
frayed through; that the elegant 
face was like a cheap edition 
printed from worn plates and the 
mind behind it an interdepend- 
ence of flimsy parts so exactly 
matched that in the weak com- 
plex there was no weakest com- 
ponent. A machine in that condi- 
tion might run indefinitely— idling. 

The doctor closed his eyes with 
a brief impatience and consigned 
the concepts to the limbo of over- 
simplified analogies. “What do 
you want?” 

Newell raised his eyebrows a 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



fraction. “I thought you knew. Oh, 
I see,” he supplemented, narrow- 
ing his eyes shrewdly. “One of 
those flash questions that are sup- 
posed to jolt the truth out of a 
man. Now let’s see, just what did 
pop into my head when you asked 
me that?” He looked at the top of 
the window studiously, then 
leaned forward and shot out a 
finger. “More.” 

“More?” 

“More — that’s the answer to 
that question. I want more money. 
More time to myself. More fun.” 
He widened his eyes and looked 
disconcertingly into the doctor’s. 
“More women,” he said, “and bet- 
ter. Just — more. You know. Can 
do?” 

“I can handle only so much,” 
said the doctor levelly. His thighs 
ached. “What you do with what I 
give you will be up to you . 
What do you know about my 
methods?” 

“Everything,” said Newell off- 
handedly. 

W ITHOUT a trace of sarcasm, 
the doctor said, “That’s fine. 
Tell me everything about my 
methods.” 

“Well, skipping details,” said 
Newell, “you hypnotize a patient, 
poke around until you find the 
parts you like. These you bring up 
by suggestion until they domi- 
nate. Likewise, you minimize 
other parts that don’t suit you and 



drive them underground. You 
push and you pull and blow up 
and squeeze down until you’re 
satisfied, and then you bake him 
in your oven — I’m using a figure 
of speech, of course — until he 
comes out just the proper-sized 
loaf. Right?” 

“You—” The doctor hesitated. 
“You skipped some details.” 

“I said I would.” 

“I heard you.” He held Newell’s 
gaze soberly for a moment. “It 
isn’t an oven or a baking.” 

“I said that, too.” 

“I was wondering why.” 

Newell snorted — amusement, 
patronization, something like that. 
Not irritation or impatience. New- 
ell had made a virtual career out 
of never appearing annoyed. He 
said, “I watch you work. Every 
minute, I watch you work; I know 
what you’re doing.” 

“Why not?” 

Newell laughed. “I’d be much 
more impressed in an atmosphere 
of mystery. You ought to get 
some incense, tapestries in here. 
Wear a turban. But back to you 
and your bake-oven, what-do-you- 
call-it — ” 

“Psychostat.” 

“Yes, psychostat. Once you’ve 
taken a man apart and put him 
together again, your psychostat 
fixes him in the new pattern the 
way boiling water fixes an egg. 
Otherwise he’d gradually slip back 
into his old, wicked ways.” 



THE OTHER MAN 



9 



He winked amiably. 

Not smiling, the doctor nodded. 
“It is something like that. You 
haven’t mentioned the most im- 
portant part, though.” 

“Why bother? Everybody 
knows about that.” His eye flicked 
to the walls and he half-turned to 
look behind him. “Either you have 
no vanity or you have more than 
anyone, Fred. What did you do 
with all the letters and citations 
that any human being would 
frame and hang? Where’s all the 
plaques that got so monotonous 
on the newscasts?” He shook his 
head. “It can’t be no vanity, so it 
must be more than anyone. You 
must feel that this whole plant — 
you yourself — are your citation.” 
He laughed, the professional 
friendly laugh of a used-car sales- 
man. “Pretty stuffy, Freddy.” 

The doctor shrugged. 

“I know what the publicity was 
for,” said Newell. “A fiendish plot 
to turn you into a personality kid 
for the first time in your life.” 
Again the engaging smile. “It isn’t 
hard to get you off the subject, 
Freddy-boy.” 

“Yes, it is,” said the doctor 
without heat. “I was just making 
the point that what I do here is 
in accordance with an ethical 
principle which states that any 
technique resulting in the destruc- 
tion of individual personality, sur- 
gical or otherwise, is murder. 
Your remarks on its being pub- 

10 



licly and legally accepted now are 
quite appropriate. If you must use 
that analogy about taking a pa- 
tient all apart and putting him to- 
gether again in a different and 
better way, you should add that 
none of the parts are replaced 
with new ones and none are left 
out. Everything you have now, 
you’ll have after your therapy.” 
“All of which,” said Newell, his 
eyes twinkling, “is backed up by 
the loftiest set of ethics since Mo- 
handas K. Gandhi.” 

f T , HE twinkle disappeared be- 
hind a vitreous screen. The 
voice was still soft. “Do you sup- 
pose I’d be fool enough to put 
myself in your hands — your hands 
— if I hadn’t swallowed you and 
your legendary ethics down to 
here?” He jabbed himself on the 
chest. “You’re so rammed full of 
ethical conduct, you don’t have 
room for an honest insult. You 
have ethics where most people 
carry their guts.” 

“Why did you come here,” 
asked the doctor calmly, “if you 
feel that much animosity?” 

“I’ll tell you why,” smiled New- 
ell. “First, I’m enjoying myself. 
I have a sense of values that tells 
me I’m a better man than you are, 
law, fame and all, and I have sev- 
enty-odd ways — one of which you 
were once married to — to prove 
it. Why wouldn’t anyone enjoy 
that?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“That was ‘first’ You’ve got a 
‘secondly 1 ?” 

“A beaut,” said Newell. “This 
one’s for kicks, too: I think I’m 
the toughest nut you’ve ever had 
to crack. I’m real happy about the 
way I am — all I want is more, not 
anything different. If you don’t 
eliminate my lovable character or 
any part of it — and you won’t; 
you’ve stacked the deck against 
yourself — you’ll wind up with just 
what you see before you, hi-fi am- 
plified. And just for a little salt in 
the stew, I might as well tell you 
that I know you can’t operate 
well without hypnosis, and I can’t 
be hypnotized.” 

“You can’t?” 

“That’s right. Look it up in a 
book. Some people can’t be hyp- 
notized because they won’t, and I 
won’t.” 

“Why not?” 

Newell shrugged and smiled. 

“I see,” said the doctor. He rose 
and went to the wall, where a 
panel slid aside for him. He took 
up a shining hypodermic, snicked 
off the sterile sheath and plunged 
the needle into an ampoule. He 
returned to the desk, holding the 
hypodermic point upward. “Roll 
up your sleeve, please.” 

“I also happen to know,” New- 
ell said, complying readily, “that 
you’re going to have one hell of a 
time sorting out drug-reaction ef- 
fects from true responses, even 
with neoscopolamine.” 



“I don’t expect my work to be 
easy. Clench your fist, please.” 

Newell did, laughing as the 
needle bit. The laugh lasted four 
syllables and then he slumped si- 
lently in his chair. 

The doctor took out a blank 
case book and carefully entered 
Newell’s name and the date and a 
few preliminary notes. In the 
“Medication” column, he wrote, 
10 cc neutral saline solution. 

He paused then and looked at 
the “better” man and murmured, 
“So you can run a mile faster than 
Einstein.” 

f f A LL ready, Doctor.” 

“Right away.” 

He went to the rack in the cor- 
ner and took down a white coat. 
Badge of office, he thought, cloak 
of Hippocrates, evolved through 
an extra outdoor duster we used 
to wear to keep the bodily hu- 
mours off our street clothes . 
and worn today because, for pa- 
tients, the generalization “doctor” 
is an easier departure point for 
therapeutics than the bewildering 
specific “man.” Next step, the ju- 
ju mask, and full circle. 

He turned into the west corri- 
dor and collided with Miss 
Thomas, who was standing across 
from Newell’s closed door. 

“Sorry!” they said in unison. 

“Really my fault,” said Miss 
Thomas. “I thought I ought to 
speak to you first, Doctor. He — 



THE OTHER MAN 



11 



he’s not completely dismantled.” 
“They very frequently aren’t.” 
“I know. Yes, I know that.” 
Miss Thomas made a totally un- 
characteristic, meaningless flutter 
of the hands and then welded 
them angrily to her starched 
flanks. 

The doctor felt amusement and 
permitted it to show. Miss 
Thomas, his head technician, was 
neither human nor female during 
working hours, and the touch of 
color, of brightness in her lack of 
ease pleased him somehow. 

She said, “I’m familiar with the 
— uh — unexpected, Doctor. Natu- 
rally. But after eighty hours of 
machine catalysis, I don’t expect 
a patient to resemble anything 
but a row of parts laid out on a 
laboratory bench.” 

“And what does this patient re- 
semble?” 

There was a sudden, soft peal 
of delighted feminine laughter 
from the closed door. Together 
they looked at its bland surface 
and then their eyes met. 

“Two hundred cycles,” said 
Miss Thomas. “Listen to her.” 
They listened: Miss Jarrell’s 
voice, a cooing, inarticulate Miss 
Jarrell, was saying, “Oh . you 
. you!” And more laughter. 

Miss Thomas said severely, “I 
know what you’re thinking about 
Hildy Jarrell, but don’t. That’s 
exactly what I did myself.” Again 
she made the uncharacteristic 

12 



flutterly gesture. “Oh-h!” she 
breathed impatiently. 

Because his impulses were kind, 
the doctor ignored most of this 
and picked up only, “Two hun- 
dred cycles. What do you get at 
the other frequencies?” 

“Oh, that’s all right, all of it. 
Average response. Pre-therapeutic 
personality responds best at 
eighty cycles. Everywhere else, 
he’s nice and accessible. Anyway,” 
she said a little louder, obviously 
to drown out another soft sudden 
chuckle from behind the door, “I 
just wanted you to know that I’ve 
done what I can. I didn’t want 
you to think I’d skipped anything 
in the spectrum. I haven’t. It’s just 
that there’s a personality in the 
200-cycle area that won’t dis- 
mantle.” 

“Yet,” he corrected mildly. 

“Oh, you can do it,” she said in 
rapid embarrassment. “I didn’t 
mean ... I only meant . .” 

S HE drew a deep breath and 
started over. “I just wanted 
you to be sure my job’s done. As 
to what you can do, you’ll handle 
it, all right. Only—” 

“Only what, Miss Thomas?” 
“It’s a pity, that’s all,” she 
blurted, and pushed past him to 
disappear around the corner. 

He shook his head, puzzlement 
and laughter wrestling gently 
deep inside him. Only then did 
something she had said fully reg- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ister with him: . there’s a per- 

sonality in the 200-cycle area that 
won’t dismantle.” 

That woman, he thought, has 
the kind of precision which might 
be clouded by emotion, but noth- 
ing would eliminate it. If she said 
there’s a personality in the 200- 
cycle area, she meant just that. A 
personality, not a component or a 
matrix or a complex. 

As she herself had put it, after 
catalysis a patient should resem- 
ble nothing more than a row of 
parts on a lab bench. Down 
through the levels of hypnosis, au- 
dible frequencies would arbitra- 
rily be assigned to various parts 
of the personality, and by sugges- 
tion each part would respond to 
its frequency throughout the ther- 
apy. Any part could be sum- 
moned, analyzed, then minimized, 
magnified, stressed or quelled in 
the final modulation and made 
permanent in the psychostat. But 
at the stage Newell was in — should 
be in — these were parts, sub-as- 
semblies at most. What did she 
mean “a personality” in the 200- 
cycle area? 

She was wrong, of course. Oh, 
Cod, he thought, she’s wrong, isn’t 
she? 

He opened the door. 

Miss Jarrell did not see him. 
He watched for a long moment, 
then said, just loud enough to be 
heard over the soft thrumming of 
the 200-cycle note from the 



speakers, “Don’t stop, Miss Jar- 
rell. I’d like to see a little more 
of this.” 

Miss Jarrell flung up a scarlet 
face. 

The doctor said again, quietly 
but with great force, “Go on, 
please.” 

She turned away to the bed, 
her back held with a painful rigid- 
ity and her ears, showing through 
her hair, looking like the tips of 
bright little tongues. 

“It’s all right,” soothed the doc- 
tor. “It’s all right, Miss Jarrell. 
You’ll see him again.” 

She made a soft sound with her 
nostrils, grinned ruefully and 
went to the controls. She set one 
of them for the patient’s allotted 
sleep-command frequency and hit 
the master switch. There was a 
gentle explosion of sound— “white” 
noise, a combination of all audio 
frequencies, which served to diso- 
rient the dismantled patient, his 
reflexive obedience attempting to 
respond to all commands at once 
—for ten seconds, and then it auto- 
matically faded, leaving the 550- 
cycle “sleep” note. The patient’s 
face went blank and he lay back 
slowly, his eyes closing. He was 
asleep before his head reached 
the pillow. 

T HE doctor stood suspended in 
thought for some time. Miss 
Jarrell gently arranged the pa- 
tient’s blanket. It was not done

dutifully nor as part of the busy- 
ness of waiting for his next move. 
For some reason, it touched the 
doctor deeply and pulled him out 
of his reverie. “Let’s have the P.T., 
Miss Jarrell.” 

“Yes, Doctor.” She consulted 
the index and carefully set the 
controls. At his nod, she touched 
the master switch. Again the white 
noise, and then the deep moo of 
the 80 -cycle tone. 

The P.T. — pre-therapeutic — 
personality would be retained un- 
touched throughout the treatment, 
right up until the final setting 
process in the psychostat, except, 
of course, for the basic post-hyp- 
notic command which kept all 
segments under control of the au- 
dio spectrum. The doctor watched 
the sleeping face and was aware 
of a most unprofessional desire to 
have something other than that 
untouched P.T. appear. 

He glanced at Miss Jarrell 
without turning his head. She 
should leave now, and ordinarily 
she would. But she was not be- 
having ordinarily just now. 

The patient’s eyes half-opened 
and stayed that way for a time. It 
was like the soft startlement of a 
feline which is aware of some- 
thing, undecided whether the 
something deserves more atten- 
tion than sleep, and therefore sim- 
ply waits, armed and therefore re- 
laxed. 

Then he saw the eyes move, 



though the lids did not. This was 
the feline taking stock, but delud- 
ing its enemies into thinking it 
still drowsy. The man changed 
like an aurora, which is ever the 
same while you watch, but some- 
thing quite different if you look 
away and look back again. I think 
in analogies, the doctor chided 
himself, when I don’t like the 
facts. 

“Well, Freddy-boy,” drawled 
Richard A. Newell. 

Behind him, he heard Miss Jar- 
rell’s almost inaudible sigh and 
her brisk quiet footsteps as she 
turned on the speech recorder, 
crossed the room and closed the 
door behind her. 

Newell said, “Nurse is an odd 
term for a woman built like that. 
How you doing, Freddy?” 

“Depends,” said the doctor. 

Newell sat up and stretched. 
He waved at the red eye of the 
recorder. “Everything I say is 
taken down and may be used 
against me, hm?” 

“Everything is used, yes. Not—” 

“Oh, spare me the homilies, 
Fred. Transcribe them yourself, 
do you?” 

“I — no.” As he caught Newell’s 
thought, and knew exactly the 
kind of thing the man was going 
to do next, he felt himself filling 
up with impotent rage. It did not 
show. 

“Fine, fine.” Projecting his voice 
a bit, Newell said over an elabo-

rate yawn, “Haven’t waked up 
like this since I was a kid. You 
know, disoriented, wondering for 
a moment where I was. Last bed 
I was in wasn’t so lonesome. 
Missed thirty of those last forty 
winks, the way she was all over 
me. ‘Dick, oh, Dick, please . .’” 
he mimicked cruelly. “Told her to 
shut up and get breakfast.” 

TTE laughed outright, obviously 
not at anything he had said, 
but at the writhing silent thing 
within the doctor, which he could 
not see but knew must be there. 

He glanced again at the pilot 
light on the recorder and said, 
“Mentioning no names, of course,” 
and the doctor understood imme- 
diately that names would be men- 
tioned, places, dates and interre- 
lationships, whenever Newell 
chose . which would be when 
the suspense ceased to entertain 
him. Meanwhile, the doctor could 
prepare himself for the behind- 
the-back gossip, the raised eye- 
brows of the transcribing typist, 
the after-hours debates as to the 
ethical position of a doctor’s prac- 
ticing on the man who had . 
who was . 

The sequence spiraled down to 
a low level of his personal inferno 
and flickered there, hot and 
smokeless. 

“You didn’t tell me,” said New- 
ell. “How you doing? Find the 
secret of my success yet?” 



The doctor shrugged easily, 
which was not easy to do. “We 
haven’t begun.” 

“Thought not.” Newell snorted. 
“By the time you’re finished, you 
won’t have begun, either.” 

“Why do you say that?” 

“I extrapolate it. I come here, 
you give me a shot of knockout 
drops, I get a sound sleep and 
wake up rested and cheerful. Oth- 
erwise, nothing. Yet I know that 
you’ve taken my slumbering cor- 
pus, poked it, prodded it, checked 
it in and wrung it out, tooted on 
your tooters, punched cards and 
clicked out four miles of com- 
puter tape — for what? I’m still 
me, only rested up a little.” 

“How do you know we did all 
that?” 

“I read the papers.” When the 
doctor made no reply, Newell 
laughed again. “You and your 
push-button therapy.” He looked 
up in recall, as if reading words 
off the ceiling. “What’s the claim 
— 82 % of your patients cured?” 

“Modulated.” 

“Pretty word, modulated. 
Pretty percentage, too. What kind 
of a sieve do you use?” 

“Sieve?” 

“Don’t tell me you don’t select 
your patients!” 

“No, we take them as they 
come.” 

“Ha. You talk like the Lysen- 
koists. Remember them? Russian 
genetics experts fifty years back.

They claimed results like that. 
They claimed non-selective meth- 
odology, too, even when some of 
the people supposed to be breed- 
ing split-kernel corn were seen 
splitting the kernels with a knife. 
Even the Communists rejected 
them after a while.” He flicked a 
wolfish glance at the recorder and 
grinned. “But then,” he said 
clearly, “no Communist would re- 
ject you, Freddy.” 

Of the four possible responses 
which came to him, the doctor 
could find none that would sound 
unlike a guilty protest, so he said 
nothing. Newell’s widening grin 
informed him that his silence was 
just as bad. 

“Ah, Fred, m’boy, I know you. 
I know you well. I knew a lot 
about you five years ago and I’ve 
learned a lot more since.” He 
touched the dark wiry tuft be- 
tween his collarbones. “Like, for 
example, you haven’t a single hair 
on your chest. Or so I’ve been 
told.” 

A GAIN the doctor used silence 
as a rejoinder. He could ex- 
amine his feelings later — he knew 
he would; he inescapably must. 
For now, he knew that any an- 
swer would fall into Newell’s 
quiver as new arrows. Silence was 
a condition Newell could not 
maintain nor tolerate; silence 
made Newell do the talking, take 
the offensive . inform on and 

16 



expose his own forces. Silence 
Newell could use only sometimes; 
words, always. 

Newell studied him for a mo- 
ment and then, apparently decid- 
ing that in order to return to a 
target, it was necessary to leave it 
temporarily, looked at the com- 
pact control panel. “I’ve read a 
lot about that. Push one button, 
I’m a fighting engine. Push an- 
other, I lie down with the lamb. 
Who was it once said humanity 
will evolve into a finger and a 
button, and every time the finger 
wants anything, it will push the 
button — and that will be the end 
of humanity, because the finger 
will get too damn lazy to push 
the button?” He wagged his head. 
“You’re going to gadget yourself 
clear out of a living, Fred.” 

“Did you read what was writ- 
ten over the entrance when you 
came here?” the doctor asked. 

“I noticed there was something 
there,” said Newell amiably, “and 
no, I didn’t read it. I assumed it 
was some saw about the sanctity 
of the personality, and I knew I’d 
get all I could stand of that from 
you and your acolytes.” 

“Then I think you ought to 
know a little more about what 
you call ‘push-button therapy,’ 
Newell. Hypnosis isn’t therapy 
and neither is the assigned audio- 
response technique we use. Hyp- 
nosis gives us access to the seg- 
ments of personality and creates 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a climate for therapy, and that’s 
all. The therapy itself stands or 
falls on the ability of the thera- 
pist, which is true of my school 
as it is of all others short of the 
lobotomists.” 

“Well, well, well. I goaded a 
real brag out of you at last. I 
didn’t know you had it in you.” 
Newell chuckled. “82% effective 
and you do it all your little self. 
Now ain’t you something? Tell 
me, able therapist, how do you ac- 
count for the 18% who get by 
you?” 

“Why do you want to know?” 

“I might alter the figures for 
you. Who are these sturdy souls?” 

“Organic defectives,” said the 
doctor. And certain others . but 
he kept that to himself. 

Newell shouted, “Touche!” and 
fell back with a roar of apprecia- 
tive laughter. But the doctor saw 
his eyes before he closed them, 
little windows with all the faces of 
hate looking out. 

The doctor was delighted. He 
braced himself for the reaction 
against his own pleasure which he 
could always expect from his aus- 
tere professionalism, but it did not 
come. He put this fact away with 
the others he knew he must ex- 
amine later. 

N EWELL was saying, “You 
can’t have it both ways, Fred. 
About hypnosis riot being therapy, 
I mean. What’s this I heard some- 



where about certain frequencies 
having certain effects, no matter 
who you are?” 

“Oh, that. Yes, some parts of 
the audio spectrum do affect most 
people. The subsonics — fourteen 
to around twenty cycles, for ex- 
ample, if you use enough ampli- 
tude— they scare people. And beat- 
frequencies between two tones, 
where the beat approaches the 
human pulse, sometimes have pe- 
culiar psychological effects. But 
these are byways, side phenom- 
ena. We use the ones we can 
rely on and ignore or avoid the 
others. Audio frequencies happen 
to be convenient, accurate and 
easy for patient and therapist to 
identify. 

“But they’re not essential. We 
could probably do the same thing 
with spoken commands or a spec- 
trum of odors. Audio is best, 
though; the pure electronic tone 
is unfamiliar to most people and 
so has no associations except the 
ones we give it. That’s why we 
don’t use 60 cycles — the hum 
you’re surrounded by all your life 
from AC devices.” 

“And what about if you’re tone- 
deaf?” asked Newell, with an un- 
derlay of gloating which could 
only mean that he was talking 
about himself. 

“Nobody’s that tone-deaf, ex- 
cept the organic defectives.” 

“Oh,” said Newell disappoint- 
edly, then returned to the half- 



THE OTHER MAN

sneering search for information. 
“And so the patient walks out of 
here prepared for the rest of his 
life to go into a state of estrus 
every time an English horn sounds 
A-440?” 

“You know better than that,” 
retorted the doctor, for once not 
concealing his impatience. “That’s 
what the psychostat is for. Every 
frequency the patient responds to 
is recorded there — ” he waved at 
the controls —“along with its in- 
tensity. These are analyzed by a 
computer and compared by an- 
other one with a pattern which 
shows which segments are out of 
line— like too much anger or un- 
warranted fear, in terms of the pa- 
tient’s optimum. The psychostat 
applies dampers on the big ones 
and amplifies the atrophied ones 
until the response matches the 
master pattern. When every seg- 
ment is at optimum— the patient’s, 
mind you; no one else’s — the new 
pattern is fixed by an overall post- 
hypnotic which removes every 
other suggestion that has been ap- 
plied.” 

“So the patient does go out of 
here hypnotized!” 

“He walks in here hypnotized,” 
said the doctor. “I’m surprised at 
you, Newell. For a man who 
knows so much about my spe- 
cialty, you shouldn’t need to be 
lectured on the elementals.” 

“I just like the sound of your 
voice,” Newell said acidly, but the 

>8 



acid was dilute. “What do you 
mean, the patient walks in here 
hypnotized?” 

“Most people are, most of the 
time. In the basic sense, a man is 
under hypnosis whenever any one 
of his senses does not respond to 
a present stimulus, or when his at- 
tention is diverted even slightly 
from his physical surroundings. 
You’re under hypnosis when you 
read a book, or when you sit and 
think and don’t see what you’re 
staring at, or when you bark your 
shin on a coffee-table you didn’t 
see under bright lights.” 

“That’s so much hair-splitting.” 
Newell didn’t even pause before 
his next sentence, which came 
from quite a different area than 
his scoffing incredulity. “Why 
didn’t you tell me all this when I 
said I couldn’t be hypnotized?” 

“I preferred to believe you 
when you said you knew it all.” 

’t' VERY pretense of joviality 
disappeared. “Listen, you,” 
Newell grated, in the ugliest tone 
of voice the doctor had ever 
heard, “you better watch what 
you’re doing.” 

It was time again for silence 
and the doctor used it. He gave 
Newell no choice but to lie there 
and stare at his own words. He 
watched the man regaining his 
poise, laboriously, hand over hand, 
then resting, testing, waiting to be 
sure he could speak again. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Well,” Newell said at length, 
and the doctor almost admired 
him for the smoothness of his 
tone, “it’s been fun so far and it’ll 
wind up more so. If you really 
can do what you say, I’ll make it 
right with you, Freddy-boy. I’ll 
really pay off.” 

“That’s nice,” said the doctor 
guardedly. 

“Nice? Just nice? Man, I’ll give 
you a treasure you couldn’t get 
any other way. You could never 
get,” he amended. He looked up 
into the doctor’s face brightly. 
“Nearly five solid years a-building 
and it’s all yours. Me, I’ll start a 
new one.” 

“What are you talking about?” 

“My little black book. Got 
everything in it from pig to prin- 
cess. Whoever you are, however 
you feel from time to time, there’s 
a playmate in there for you. You 
could really use it, Freddy. You 
must have stored up quite a 
charge since you-know-what,” he 
said, grinning at the recording 
machine. “Fix me up, I fix you 
up. Fair enough?” 

The silence this time was un- 
planned. The doctor walked to 
the controls, dialed 550 and hit 
the master. The 80-cycle note 
died, the white noise took over, 
and then the 550-cycle sleep com- 
mand. The doctor felt that gleam- 
ing grin leave the room like a 
pressure off his back. 

He is a patient, the doctor 



thought at last, out of his hard- 
held numbness. He is a patient 
in a therapeutic environment as 
detached from the world as a non- 
Euclidean theorem. There is no 
Newell; there is only a patient 
There is no Fred, only a doctor. 
There is no Osa, only episodes. 
Newell will be returned to the 
world because he has a person- 
ality and it has an optimum, be- 
cause that is what I do here and 
that is what I am for. 

He touched the annunciator 
control and said, “Miss Jarrell, I 
want you.” 

She opened the door almost im- 
mediately; she must have been 
waiting in the corridor. “Oh, Doc- 
tor, I am sorry! I know I shouldn’t 
do anything like that. It’s just — 
well, before I knew it . .” 

“Don’t apologize, Miss Jarrell. 
I mean it — don’t. You may even 
have done some good. But I have 
to know exactly what influences 
were . no, don’t explain,” he said 
when she tried to speak. “Show 
me.” 

“Oh, I couldn’t! It’s so — silly!” 
“Go on, Miss Jarrell. It isn’t 
silly at all.” 

LUSHING, she passed him 
with her eyes averted and 
went to the controls. She dialed a 
frequency and activated the mas- 
ter, and as the white noise roared 
out, she went to the foot of the 
bed, waiting. The audio faded, all

but a low, steady thrum — 200 
cycles. 

The patient opened his eyes. 
He smiled. It was a smile the like 
of which the doctor had never 
seen before, though he might have 
imagined one. Not, however, on 
the face of Richard A. Newell. 
There was nothing conceivable in 
Richard A. Newell to coexist with 
such an expression. 

The patient glanced down and 
saw Miss Jarrell. Ecstatic recog- 
nition crossed his face. He grasped 
the covers and whipped them 
over his head, and lay stiff and 
still as a pencil. 

“You . .!” crooned Miss Jarrell, 
and the blanket was flung down 
away from the patient’s head, and 
he gurgled with laughter. She 
snatched at his toes, and he 
bucked and chortled, and covered 
up again. “The bumble bee — ” she 
murmured, and he quivered, a 
paroxysm of delighted anticipa- 
tion— “goes round the tree . 
and goes bzz . bzzz . BZZ!” 
and she snatched at his toes again. 

He whipped the blanket away 
from his face and gave himself up 
to an explosion of merriment 
which was past vocalization — in 
fact, but for that soft and intense 
chuckle, he had made hardly a 
sound. 

“You . .” 

The doctor watched and slowly 
felt a vacuum in the scene some- 
how, and a great tugging to fill it 




with understanding, and the un- 
derstanding would not come until 
the word “ridiculous” slipped 
through his mind . and that was 
it: This should be ridiculous, a 
grown man reacting like a seven- 
month infant. What was extraor- 
dinary was that it was not ridicu- 
lous and that it was indeed a 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




grown man, not a mere infantile 
segment. 

It was a thing to be felt. There 
was a — a radiance in these bursts 
of candid merriment which, 
though certainly childlike, were 
not childish. It was a quality to be 
laughed with, not laughed at 

He glanced at the audio selec- 



tor. Yes, this was the 200-cycle 
response that Miss Thomas had 
mentioned. “A personality—” He 
began to see what she had meant. 
He began, too, to be afraid. 

He went to the wall rack where 
the technician’s response-break- 
down was clipped. It was a stand- 
ard form, one column showing the 



THE OTHER MAN 



21 



frequencies arbitrarily assigned to 
age levels (700 cycles and the 
command suggestion: “You are 
eleven years old”) and another 
column with the frequencies as- 
signed to emotional states (800 
cycles and “You are very angry;” 
14 cycles, “You are afraid”). 

Once the patient was com- 
pletely catalyzed, response states 
could readily be induced and their 
episodic material extracted — fear 
at age three, sexuality at fourteen, 
fear plus anger plus gratification 
at age six, or any other combina- 
tion. 

The 200-cycle area was blotchy 
with Miss Thomas’s erasures, but 
otherwise blank. 

The doctor inwardly shook 
himself and got a firm grip. He 
went to the bed and stood look- 
ing down at that sensitive, re- 
sponsive face. 

“Who are you?” he asked. 

rpHE patient looked at him, 
eyes bright, a glad, anticipa- 
tory smile on his lips. The doctor 
sensed that the man did not un- 
derstand him, but that he was 
eager to; further, that from the 
bottom of his heart the man was 
prepared to be delighted when he 
did understand. It filled the doc- 
tor with an almost tender anxiety, 
a protectiveness. This creature 
could not be disappointed — that 
would be inartistic to the point of 
gross injustice. 

22 



“What’s your name?” the doc- 
tor pursued. 

The patient smiled at him and 
sat up. He looked into the doctor’s 
eyes with an almost unbearable 
attention and a great waiting, 
ready to treasure whatever might 
come next if only — if only he 
could identify it. 

One thing’s certain, mused the 
doctor: this was no infantile seg- 
ment. Child, yes, but not quite 
child. 

“Miss Jarrell.” 

“Yes, Doctor.” 

“The initial, the middle initial 
on the chart. It’s ‘A.’ What does 
that stand for?” 

After a moment, “Anson,” she 
said. 

To the patient, he said, “I’m 
going to call you Anson. That will 
be your name.” He put his hand 
on the patient’s chest. “Anson.” 

The man looked down at the 
hand and up, expectantly, at the 
doctor. 

The doctor said, touching his 
white coat, “Doctor. Doctor.” He 
pointed at Miss Jarrel. “Miss — ” 

“Hildy,” said Miss Jarrell 
quickly. 

The doctor could not help it; he 
grinned briefly. This elicited a si- 
lent burst of glee from the patient, 
which was shut off instantly, to 
be replaced by the anticipation, 
the watchful and ready attentive- 
ness. He burdened the doctor 
with his waiting and the necessity 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to appreciate. Yet what burden 
was it, really? This creature 
would appreciate the back of a 
hand across the face or two cho- 
ruses of the Londonderry Air. 

The doctor poised over the bed, 
waiting for an answer, and it 
came: 

The burden lay in the nec- 
essity not to please this entity, but 
to do this thing properly, in ways 
which would never have to be 
withdrawn later. He trusts me — 
there, in three words, was the 
burden. 

The doctor took the patient’s 
hand and put the fingertips close 
to his lips. “An-son,” he said. Then 
he put the hand to the patient’s 
own mouth, nodding encourag- 
ingly. 

The patient obviously wanted 
to do it right, too — more, even, 
than the doctor. His lips trembled. 
Then, “An-son,” he said. 

Across the room, Miss Jarrell 
clapped her hands and laughed 
happily. 

“That’s right,” smiled the doc- 
tor, pointing. “Anson. You’re An- 
son.” He touched his own chest. 
“Doc-tor.” He pointed again. 
“Miss Hildy.” 

The man in the bed sat up 
slowly, his eyes on the doctor’s 
face. “An-son. Anson.” And then 
a light seemed to flood him. He 
hit his chest with his knuckles. 
“Anson!” he cried. He felt his 
own biceps, his face, and laughed. 



“That’s right,” said the doctor. 
“Doc . tok,” said Anson with 
difficulty. He looked wistful, al- 
most distraught. 

“That’s okay. That’s good. Doc- 
tor.” 

“Doc-tor.” Anson turned brightly 
to Miss Jarrell and pointed. “Miss 
Hildy!” he sang triumphantly. 

“Bless you,” she said, saying it 
like a blessing. 

W HILE Anson grinned, the 
doctor stood for a moment 
grinning back like a fool and feel- 
ing frightened and scratching his 
head. 

Then he went to work. 
“Richard,” he said sharply, and 
watched for a reaction. 

There was none, just the happy 
eagerness. 

“Dick.” 

Nothing. 

“Newell.” 

Nothing. 

“Hold up your right hand. Close 
your eyes. Look out of the win- 
dow. Touch your hair. Let me see 
your tongue.” ' 

Anson did none of these things. 
The doctor wet his lips. “Osa.” 
Nothing. 

He glanced at Miss Jarrell. 
“Anson,” he said, and Anson in- 
creased his attention. It was star- 
tling; the doctor hadn’t known he 
could. “Anson, listen.” He pulled 
back his sleeve and showed his 
watch. “Watch. Watch.” He held

it close, then put it to Anson’s ear. 

Anson gurgled delightedly. “Tk 
tk,” he mimicked. He cocked his 
head and listened carefully to the 
doctor repeating the word. Then, 
“Wats. Watts. Watch,” he said, 
and clapped his hands exactly as 
Miss Jarrell had done before. 

“All right, Miss Jarrell. That’s 
enough for now. Turn him off.” 

He heard her intake of breath 
and thought she was going to 
speak. When she did not, he faced 
her and smiled. “It’s all right, 
Miss Jarrell. We’ll take good care 
of him.” 

She looked for the sarcasm in 
his face, between his words, back 
in recall, anywhere, and did not 
find it. She laughed suddenly and 
heartily; he knew she was laugh- 
ing at herself, spellbound as she 
had been, anxious for the shining 
something which hid in the 200- 
cycle area. 

“I could use a little therapy 
myself, I guess,” she said wonder- 
ingly. 

“I would recommend it to you 
if you had reacted any other 
way.” 

She went to the door and 
opened it. “I like working here,” 
she said, blushed, and went out. 

The doctor’s smile disappeared 
with the click of the latch. He 
glanced once at the patient, then 
moved blindly to the controls. He 
locked them and went back to his 
office.

jV/|ISS THOMAS knocked. Get- 
ting no answer, she entered 
the doctor’s office. “Oh, I beg your 
pardon, I thought you were still—” 
The expression on his face 
halted her. She took the reports 
she carried and put them down on 
the desk. He did not move. She 
went to the cabinet, which slid 
open for her, and shook two white 
pills from a vial. She broke a 
beam with a practiced flick of the 
wrist. A paper cup dropped and 
filled with ice-water. She took it 
to the doctor. “Here.” 

He said rapidly, “What? What? 
What?” and, seeking, looked the 
wrong way to find her voice. He 
turned again, saw her. “What?” 
and put his hand for a moment 
over his eyes. “Oh, Miss Thomas.” 
“Here,” said the technician 
again. 

“What is it?” He seemed to be 
trying to identify the cup, as if he 
had never seen one before. 

Because she was kind, Miss 
Thomas took it another way. 
“Dexamyl.” 

“Thank you.” He took them, 
swallowed water, and looked up 
at her. “Thank you,” he said 
again. “I seem to be . .” 

“It’s all right,” said Miss 
Thomas firmly. “Everything’s all 
right.” 

Some of his control returned 
and he chuckled a little. “Using 
my own therapy on me?” 

“Everything is all right, far as 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I know,” she said, in the grumpy 
tone under which she so often 
concealed herself. She folded her 
arms with an all but audible snap 
and glared out of the window. 

The doctor glanced up at her 
rigid back and, in spite of himself, 
was amused. She was daring him 
to order her out, challenging him 
not to tell her what the trouble 
was. He recalled, then, that she 
was doubtlessly gnawed like the 
Spartan boy by the fox of curi- 
osity she was hiding under her 
starch. There’s a personality in 
the 200-cycle area that won’t dis- 
mantle ... oh, you can do it, but 
. it’s a pity, that’s all, he re- 
called. 

He said, “It’s one of those things 
of Prince’s.” 

She was quiet for so long that 
she might not have heard him and 
I’m damned, he thought, if I’m 
going to spell it out for her. 

But she said, “I don’t believe 
it,” and, into his continued silence, 
“Morton Prince’s alternate-per- 
sonality idea might be the only 
explanation for some cases, but it 
doesn’t explain this one.” 

“It doesn’t?” 

“Two personalities in one mind 
— three or more sometimes. One 
of his case histories was of a 
woman who had five distinct egos. 
I’m not quarreling with the possi- 
bility, Doctor.” 

Every time Miss Thomas sur- 
prised him, it was in a way that 



pleased him. He would, he 
thought, think that through some 
day. 

“Then why quarrel with this 
one?” he asked. 

T T NASKED and unabashed, she 
sat down in the big chair. 
They sat for a time in a compan- 
ionable, cerebral quiet. 

Then she said, “Prince’s case 
histories show a lot of variation. I 
mean one ego will be refined, edu- 
cated, another rough and stupid. 
Sometimes the prime was aware 
of the others, sometimes not; 
sometimes they hated each other. 
But there was this denominator: 
If the condition existed at all, it 
existed because the alternate ego 
could communicate and did. Had 
to.” 

“Morton Prince wasn’t equipped 
for segmentation under tertiary 
hypnosis.” 

“I think that’s beside the point,” 
Miss Thomas said flatly. “I’ll say 
it again: Prince’s alternate egos 
had to emerge. I think that’s the 
key. If an ego can’t communicate 
and won’t emerge unless you drag 
it out by the scruff of the neck, I 
don’t think it deserves to be called 
an ego.” 

“You can say that and yet 
you’ve seen Ans — the alternate?” 

“Anson. Hildy Jarrell told me 
about the christening. Yes, I can 
say that.” 

He looked at her levelly and

she dropped her eyes. He remem- 
bered again their encounter in the 
corridor in front of Newell’s door. 
Don’t blame Hildy Jarrell —that’s 
exactly what I did myself. 

“Miss Thomas, why are you 
trying to herd me away from this 
case?” 

“Doctor!” 

He closed his eyes and said, 
“You find a segment that you 
can't break. It’s a particularly — 
well, let’s say that whatever it is, 
you like it.” He paused and, ex- 
actly in time, said, “Don’t inter- 
rupt me. You know very well that 
the rock bottom of my practice is 
that personality is inviolate. You 
know that if this is a genuine case 
of alternate ego, I wouldn’t touch 
it — I couldn’t, because the man 
has only one body, and to normal- 
ize him, I’d have to destroy one 
ego or the other. 

“Now you knew perfectly well 
that I’d discover the alternate. So 
the first thing you do is call my 
attention to it, and the next thing 
you do is give me an argument 
about it, knowing I’d disagree 
with you, knowing that if there 
was any doubt in my mind, it 
would disappear in the argument.” 

“Why on earth would I do a 
thing like that?” she challenged. 

“I told you — so I’d get off the 
case — reset the P.T. and dis- 
charge him.” 

“Damn it,” said Miss Thomas 
bitterly. 

26 



I THAT’S the trouble with 
-*• knowing too much about a 
colleague’s thought processes,” he 
said into midair. “You can’t ma- 
nipulate somebody who under- 
stands you.” 

“Which one of us do you 
mean?” she demanded. 

“I really don’t know. Now are 
you going to tell me why you 
tried this, or shall I tell you?” 

“I’ll tell you,” said Miss Thomas. 
“You’re tired. I don’t want any- 
thing to happen to that Anson. As 
soon as I found him, I knew ex- 
actly what would happen if you 
went ahead with Newell’s ther- 
apy. Anson would be the in- 
truder. I don’t care how — how 
beautiful an intruder he might be, 
he could only show up as an aber- 
ration, something extraneous. 
You’d pack him down to pill size 
and bury him so deep in. a new- 
model Newell that he’d never see 
daylight again. I don’t know how 
much consciousness he has, but I 
do know I couldn’t bear to have 
him buried alive. 

“And supposing you committed 
therapy on Anson alone, brought 
him up like a shiny young Billy 
Budd and buried that heel New- 
ell— if you’ll pardon the unpro- 
fessional term, Doctor — down in- 
side him somewhere? You think 
Anson would be able to defend 
himself? You think he could take 
a lane in the big rat race? This 
world is no place for cherubim. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“So there isn’t a choice. I don’t 
know what Anson shares with 
Newell and I never will. I do 
know that however Anson has ex- 
isted so far, it hasn’t spoiled him, 
and the only chance he has to go 
on being what he is is to be left 
alone.” 

“ Quod erat demonstrandum,” 
said the doctor, spreading his 
hands. “Very good. Now you 
know why I’ve never treated al- 
ternate ego cases. And perhaps 
you also know how useless your 
little machination was.” 

“I had to be sure, that’s all. 
Well, I’m glad. I’m sorry.” 

He smiled briefly. “I follow 
that.” He watched her get up, her 
face softened by content and her 
admiration of him unconcealed. 

She bent an uncharacteristi- 
cally warm gaze on him and 
moved toward the door. She 
looked back once on the way, and 
once there, she stopped and turned 
to face him. “Something’s the 
matter.” 

There were, he knew, other 
ways to handle this, but at the 
moment he had to hurt some- 
thing. There were several ways to 
do the hurt, too, and he chose the 
worst one, saying nothing. 

Miss Thomas became Miss 
Thomas again, her eyes like one- 
way mirrors and her stance like a 
soldier. She looked out of herself 
at him and said, “You’re going on 
with the therapy.” 



He did not deny it. 

“Are you going to tell me which 
one gets it?” 

“Depends on what you mean 
by ‘gets it,’” he said with grim 
jocularity. 

She treated the bad joke as it 
deserved to be treated and simply 
waited for it to go away. 

He said, “Both.” 

S HE repeated the word in ex- 
actly his inflection, as though 
she could understand it better if 
it were as near as her own lips. 
Then she shook her head impa- 
tiently. “You can apply just so 
much therapy and then there’s a 
choice to make.” 

“There’s this choice to make,” 
he said, in a constricted tone that 
hurt his throat. “Newell lives in a 
society he isn’t fit for. He’s mar- 
ried to a woman he doesn’t de- 
serve. If it is in my power to make 
him more fit and more deserving, 
what is the ethical choice?” 

Miss Thomas moved close to 
the desk. “You implied that you’d 
turned down cases like this be- 
fore. You sent them back into so- 
ciety, untreated.” 

“Once they sent lepers back 
untreated,” he snapped. “Therapy 
has to start somewhere, with 
someone.” 

“Start it on rats first.” 

I am, he said, fortunately to 
himself. He considered her re- 
mark further and decided not to

answer it, knowing how deeply 
she must regret saying it. 

She said, “Hildy Jarrell will 
quit when she finds this out.” 

“She will not quit,” said the 
doctor immediately and positively. 

“And as for me—” 

“Yes?” 

Their gazes locked like two steel 
rods placed tip to tip, pressing, 
pressing, knowing that some slight 
wavering, some side drift, must 
come and must make a break and 
a collision. 

But instead, she broke. She 
closed her eyes against tears and 
clasped her hands. “Please,” she 
whispered, “do you have to go 
through with this? Why? Why?” 

Oh, God, he thought, I hate 
this. “I can’t discuss it.” That, he 
thought painfully, is altogether 
the truth. 

She said heavily, “I don’t think 
you should.” He knew it was her 
last word. 

“It is a psychological decision, 
Miss Thomas, and not a techno- 
logical one.” He knew it was un- 
fair to fall back on rank and spe- 
cialty when he no longer had an 
argument he could use. But this 
had to stop. 

She nodded. “Yes, Doctor.” She 
went out, closing the door too qui- 
etly. He thought, What do you 
have to be to a person so you can 
run after someone crying, Come 
back! Come back! Don’t hate me! 
I’m in trouble and I hurt!

I T took Miss Jarrell about forty 
minutes to get to the office. 
The doctor had figured it at about 
thirty-five. He was quite ready 
for her. 

She knocked with one hand 
and turned the knob with the 
other and flew in like an angry 
bee. Her face was flushed and 
there was a little pale tension-line 
parenthesizing each nostril. “Doc- 
tor — ” 

“Ah, Miss Jarrell,” he said with 
a huge joviality. “I was just about 
to call you. I need your help for 
a special project.” 

“Well, I’m sorry about that," 
she began. Her eyes were wide 
and aflame, and the rims were 
slightly pink. He wished he could 
magic a few minims of azacyclo- 
nol into her bloodstream; she 
could use it. “I’ve come to—” 
“The Newell case.” 

“Yes, the Newell case. I don’t 
think-” 

He had almost to shout this 
time. “And I think you’re just the 
one for the job. I want that 200- 
cycle entity — you know, Anson — 
I want him educated.” 

“Well, I think it’s just — what?” 
And as the angry syllable rico- 
cheted around the office, she stared 
at him and asked timidly, “I beg 
your pardon?” 

“I’d like to relieve you of your 
other duties and put you with An- 
son full time. Would you like 
that?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Would I like . what will I 
do?” 

“I want to communicate with 
him. He needs a vocabulary and 
he needs elementary instruction. 
He probably doesn’t know how to 
hold a fork or blow his nose. I 
think you can do a good job of 
teaching him.” 

“Well, I — why, I’d love to!” 
“Good. Good,” he said like a de- 
partment-store Santa Claus. “Just 
a few details. I’ll want every min- 
ute on sound film, from white 
noise to white noise, and I’ll want 
to review the film every day. And, 
of course, I’d have to ask you not 
to discuss this with anyone, on or 
off the staff. It’s a unique case 
and a new therapy, and a lot de- 
pends on it. On you.” 

“Oh, you can depend on me, 
Doctor!” 

I TE nodded agreement. “We’ll 
start tomorrow morning. I’ll 
have the first word-lists and other 
instructions ready for you by then. 
Meanwhile, I’ve got some re- 
search to do. Contact the Medical 
Information Service in Washing- 
ton and have them key in Prince, 
Morton, and Personality, Multi- 
ple, on their Big Brain. I want ab- 
stracts of everything that has 
been published in the last fifty 
years on the subject. No dupli- 
cates. An index. Better order mi- 
crofilm and send it by telefax, AA 
priority.” 

THE OTHER MAN 



“Yes, Doctor,” said Miss Jarrell 
eagerly. “Foreign publications 
too?” 

“Everything any researcher has 
done. And put a Confidential on 
the order as well as the delivery.” 

“Really secret.” 

“Really.” He concealed the 
smile which struggled to show it- 
self; in his mind, he had seen the 
brief image of a little girl hiding 
jelly-beans. “And get me the 
nurses’ duty-list. I have some jug- 
gling to do.” 

“Very well, Doctor. Is that all?” 

“All for now.” 

She nearly skipped to the door. 
He saw a flash of white as she 
opened it; Miss Thomas was 
standing in the outer office. He 
could not have been more pleased 
if she had been there by his expli- 
cit orders, for Miss Jarrell said, as 
she went out, “And thank you, 
Doctor — thank you very much.” 

Chew on that, Thomas, he 
thought, feeling his own small vin- 
dictiveness and permitting him- 
self to enjoy it for once. 

And: Why am I jumping on 
Thomas? 

Well, because I have to jump 
on somebody once in a while and 
she can take it. 

Why don’t I tell her every- 
thing? She has a good head. Might 
have some really good ideas. Why 
not? 

Why not? he asked again into 
a joyless void. Because I could be 

39 



wrong. I could be so wrong. That’s 
why not. 

T HE research began, and the 
long night work. In addition 
to the vast amount of collateral 
reading — there was much more 
material published on the subject 
of multiple personality than he 
had realized — he had each day’s 
film to analyze, notes to make, 
abstracts to prepare for computer- 
coding, and then, after prolonged 
thought, the next day’s lessons to 
outline. 

The rest of the clinic refused to 
stop and wait for this job to be 
done, and he had an additional 
weight of conscience as he con- 
cealed his impatience with every- 
thing else but the Newell case. He 
was so constituted that such a 
weight made him over-meticulous 
in the very things he wished to 
avoid, so that his ordinary work 
took more time rather than less. 

As for the research, much of it 
was theory and argumentation; 
the subject, like reincarnation, 
seemed to attract zealots of the 
most positive and verbose varie- 
ties, both pro and con. Winnow- 
ing through the material, he 
isolated two papers of extreme 
interest to him. One was a theory, 
one an interim report on a series of 
experiments which had never 
been completed due to the death 
of the researcher. 

The theory, advanced by one 



Weisbaden, was based on a search 
through just such material as this. 
Indeed, Weisbaden seemed to 
have been the only man besides 
himself who had ever asked the 
Medical Information Service for 
this complete package. 

From it, he had abstracted sta- 
tistics, weighted them to suit his 
theory, and come up with the sur- 
prising opinion that multiple per- 
sonality was a twinning phenome- 
non, and that if a method were 
found for diagnosing all such 
cases, a correspondence would be 
found between the incidence of 
multiple births and the incidence 
of multiple personalities. So many 
births per thousand are twins, so 
many per hundred thousand are 
triplets, and the odds with quads 
and quints are in the millions. 

So, too, said Weisbaden, would 
be the statistical expectation for 
the multiple personality phenom- 
enon, once such cases stopped 
being diagnosed as schizoids and 
other aberrates. 

Weisbaden had not been a 
medical man — he was some sort 
of actuary — but his inference was 
fascinating. How many twins and 
triplets walked the Earth in single 
bodies, without any organic indi- 
cation that they were not single 
entities? How many were getting 
treatment for conditions they did 
not have; how many Siamese 
twins were being penalized be- 
cause they would not walk like 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



other quadrupeds; how many sep- 
arate entities were being forced 
to spend their lives in lockstep? 

Some day, thought the doctor — 
as so many doctors have thought 
before — some day, when we can 
get closer to the genetic biolo- 
gists, when psychology becomes a 
true science, when someone de- 
vises a cross-reference system be- 
tween the disciplines which really 
works . and some day, when I 
have the time — well, maybe I 
could test this ingenious guess. 
But it’s only a guess, based on 
neither observation nor experi- 
ment. Intriguing, though — if only 
it could be tested. 

The other paper was of practi- 
cal value. A certain Julius Marx — 
again not a medical man, but a 
design engineer with, apparently, 
hobbies — had built an electro-en- 
cephalograph for two (would any- 
one ever write a popular song 
about that?) which graphed each 
of the patients through a series of 
stimuli, and at the same time 
drew a third graph, a resultant. 

l^TARX was after a means of 
determining brain-wave 
types, rather than individual spec- 
imens, and had done circuitry on 
machines which would handle up 
to eight people at once. In a foot- 
note, with dry humor, he had 
qualified his paper for this par- 
ticular category: "Perhaps one 
day the improbable theories of 



Dr. Prince might approach impos- 
sibility through the use of this de- 
vice upon a case of multiple per- 
sonality.” 

Immediately on reading this, 
the doctor ordered EEGs on both 
Anson and Newell, and when he 
had both before him, he wished 
fervently that Julius Marx had 
been there with him; he sus- 
pected that the man enjoyed a 
good laugh, even on himself. 

The graphs were as different as 
such graphs can possibly be. 

The confirmation of his diagno- 
sis was spectacular, and he left a 
note for Miss Jarrell to track 
down every multiple personality 
case he had rejected for the past 
eight years and see what could be 
done about some further tests. 
What would come after the tests, 
he did not know — yet. 

The other valuable nudge he 
got from the Marx paper was the 
idea of a resultant between two 
dissimilar electro-encephalograms. 
He made one from the Newell- 
Anson EEGs — without the use of 
anything as Goldbergian as 
Marx’s complicated device, but 
with a simple computer coupling. 
He kept it in his top desk drawer, 
and every few days he would draw 
it out and he would wonder . 

Therapy for Anson wasn’t ther- 
apy. Back at the very beginning, 
Miss Thomas had said that his 
was a personality that wouldn’t 
dismantle; she had been quite

right. You can’t get episodic mate- 
rial from an entity which has had 
no subjective awareness, no expe- 
rience, which has no name, no 
sense of identity, no motility, no 
recall. 

There were many parts to that 
strange radiance of Anson’s and 
they were all in the eye of the be- 
holder, who protected Anson be- 
cause he was defenseless, who was 
continually amazed at his unself- 
consciousness as if it were an at- 
tribute rather than a lack. His 
discovery of the details of self and 
surroundings was a never-ending 
delight to watch, because he him- 
self was delighted and had never 
known the cruel penalties we im- 
pose on expressed delight, nor the 
masking idioms we use instead: 
Not a bad sunset there. Yeah. 
Real nice. 

“He’s good,” Miss Jarrell said 
to the doctor once. “He’s only 
good — nothing else.” 

Therapy for Newell was, how- 
ever, therapy, and not rewarding. 
The properly dismantled and seg- 
mented patient is relatively sim- 
ple to handle. 

Key in anger (1200 cycles) 
and demand “How old are you?” 
Since anger does not exist unsup- 
ported, an episode must emerge; 
the anger has an object, which ex- 
isted at a time and place; and 
there’s your episode. “I’m six,” 
says your patient. Key in the 
“You are six years ojd” note for 

32 



reinforcement and you’re all 
ready for significant recall. Or 
start with the age index: “You are 
twelve years old.” When that is 
established, demand, “How do 
you feel?” and if there is signifi- 
cant material in the twelfth year, 
it will emerge. If it is fear, add 
the “fear” note and ask “Where 
are you?” and you’ll have the 
whole story. 

B UT not in Newell’s case. There 
was, of course, plenty of con- 
flict material, but somehow the 
conflicts seemed secondary; they 
were effects rather than causes. 
By far the largest category of 
traumas is the unjustified attack 
— a severe beating, a disease, a re- 
jection. It is traumatic because, 
from the patient’s point of view, it 
is unjustified. In Newell’s case, 
there was plenty of suffering, 
plenty of defeat; yet in every sin- 
gle episode, he had earned it. So 
he was without guilt. His inner 
conviction was that his every 
cruelty was justified. 

The doctor had an increasing 
sense that Newell had lived all his 
life in a books-balanced, debts- 
paid condition. His episodes had 
no continuity, one to the other. It 
was as if each episode occurred at 
right angles to the line of his exis- 
tence; once encountered, it was 
past, like a mathematical point. 
The episodes were easy to locate, 
impossible to relate to one an-

other and to the final product 

The doctor tried hard to treat 
Anson and Newell in his mind as 
discrete, totally unconnected in- 
dividuals, but Miss Jarrell’s sen- 
timental remark kept echoing in 
his mind: “He’s good; he’s only 
good — nothing else,” and generat- 
ing an obverse to apply to New- 
ell: He’s evil, he’s only evil — 
nothing else. 

This infuriated him. How nice, 
how very nice, he told himself sar- 
castically, the spirits of good and 
evil to be joined together to make 
a whole man, and how tidily 
everything fits; black is totally 
black and white is white, and to- 
gether the twain shall make gray. 
He found himself telling himself 
that it wasn’t as simple as that, 
and things did not work out ac- 
cording to moral evaluations 
which were more arbitrary even 
than his assigned audio. 

It was about this time that he 
began to doubt the rightness of 
his decision, the worth of his ther- 
apy, the possibility of the results 
he wanted, and himself. And he 
had no one to advise him. He 
told that to Miss Thomas. 

It was easy to do and it sur- 
prised both of them. He had 
called her in to arrange a daily 
EEG on both facets of the Newell 
case and explain about the resul- 
tant, which he also wanted daily. 
She said yes, Doctor, and very 
well, Doctor, and right away, Doc- 



tor, and a number of other abso- 
lutely correct things. But she 
didn’t say why, Doctor? or that’s 
good, Doctor, and suddenly he 
couldn’t stand it. 

He said, “Miss Thomas, we’ve 
got to bury the hatchet right now. 
I could be wrong about this case, 
and if I am, it’s going to be bad. 
Worse than bad. That’s not what 
bothers me,” he added quickly, 
afraid she might interrupt, know- 
ing that this must spill over or 
never emerge again. “I’ve been 
through bad things before and I 
can handle that part of it.” 

Then it came out, simple and 
astonishing to them both: “But 
I’m all alone with it, Tommie.” 

H E had never called her that 
before, not even to himself, 
and he was overwhelmed with 
wonderment at where it might 
have come from. 

Miss Thomas said, “No, you’re 
not,” gruffly. 

“Well, hell,” said the doctor, 
and then got all his control back. 
He dropped a film cartridge into 
the viewer and brought out his 
notes. Using them as index, he sat 
with his hand on the control, spin- 
ining past the more pedestrian 
material and showing her the 
highlights. He presented no inter- 
pretations while she watched and 
listened. 

She heard Newell snarling, 
“You better watch what you’re

doing,” and Anson pointing about 
the room, singing, “Floor, flower, 
book, bed, bubble. Window, wheel, 
wiggle, wonderful.” (He had not 
known at that stage what a won- 
derful was, but Miss Jarrell said 
it almost every hour on the hour.) 
She saw Newell in recall, aged 
eleven, face contorted, raging at 
his fifth-grade teacher, “I’ll bomb 
ya, y’ole bitch!” and at thirteen, 
coolly pleased at something best 
unmentioned concerning a kitten 
and a centrifuge. 

She saw Anson standing in the 
middle of the room, left elbow in 
right hand, left thumb pressed to 
the point of his chin, a stance af- 
fected by the doctor when in per- 
plexity: “When I know every- 
thing there is to know,” Anson 
had said soberly, “there’ll be two 
Doctor Freds.” 

At this, Miss Thomas grunted 
and said, “You wouldn’t want a 
higher compliment than that from 
anybody, anytime.” The doctor 
shushed her, but kindly. The first 
time he had seen that sequence, it 
made his eyes sting. It still did. 
He said nothing. 

She saw it all, right up to yes- 
terday’s viewing, with Newell in a 
thousand pieces from what ap- 
peared to be a separate jigsaw 
puzzle for each piece, and Anson 
a bright wonder, learning to read 
now, marveling at everything be- 
cause everything was new — tea- 
spoons and music and mountains, 

34 



the Solar System and sandwiches 
and the smell of vanilla. 

And as he watched, doors 
opened in the doctor’s mind. They 
did not open wide, but enough for 
him to know that they were there 
and in which walls. How to de- 
scribe the indescribable feeling of 
expertness? 

It is said that a good truck- 
driver has nerve-endings which 
extend to the bumper and tail 
light, tire tread to overhead. The 
virtuoso pianist does not will each 
separate spread and crook of each 
finger; he wills the notes and they 
appear. 

The doctor had steered this 
course of impossible choices by 
such willing and such orientation; 
and again he felt it, the urge that 
this way is right now and there 
is the thing to do next. The mi- 
racle to him was not the feeling, 
but that it had come back to him 
while he watched the films and 
heard the tapes with Miss 
Thomas, who had said nothing, 
given no evaluation or advice. 
They were the same films he had 
studied, run in the same se- 
quence. The difference was only 
in not being alone any more. 

“Where are you going?” Miss 
Thomas asked him. 

From the coat closet, he said, 
“File that material and lock it up, 
will you, Miss Thomas? I’ll call 
you as soon as I return.” He went 
to the door and smiled back at 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



her. It hurt his face. “Thanks.” 
Miss Thomas opened her mouth 
to speak, but did not. She raised 
her right hand in a sort of salute 
and turned around to put the 
files away. 

HP HE doctor called from a booth 
near the Newell apartment 
“Did I wake you, Osa? I’m sorry. 
Sometimes I don’t know how late 
it gets.” 

“Who . Fred? Is that you, 
Fred?” 

“Are you up to some painful 
conversation?” 

Alarmed, she cried, “Is some- 
thing the matter? Is Dick — ” 

He mentally kicked himself for 
his clumsiness. What other inter- 
pretation could she have put on 
such a remark? “He’s okay. I’m 
sorry. I guess Tm not good at the 
light banter . Can I see you?” 
She paused for a long moment. 
He could hear her breathing. “I’ll 
come out. Where are you?” 

He told her. 

She said, “There’s a cafe just 
around the comer, to your left. 
Give me ten minutes.” 

He put up the phone and went 
to the comer. It was on a dingy 
street which seemed to be in hid- 
ing. On the street, the cafe hid. 
Inside the cafe, booths hid. In one 
of the booths, the doctor sat and 
was hidden. It was all he could do 
to keep himself from assuming a 
fetal posture. 



A waiter came. He ordered Col- 
linses, made with light rum. He 
slumped then, with his forearms 
on the table and his chin on them, 
and watched bubbles rise in the 
drinks and collect on the under- 
side of the shaved ice, until the 
glasses frosted too much for him 
to see. Then he closed his eyes 
and attempted to suspend 
thought, but he heard her foot- 
steps and sprang up. 

“Here I am,” he said in a seal- 
like bark far louder than he had 
intended. 

She sat opposite him. “Rum col- 
lins,” she said, and only then did 
he remember that it had always 
been the drink they shared, when 
they had shared things. He de- 
manded of himself, Now why did 
I have to do that? and answered, 
You know perfectly well why. 

“Is he really all right?” she 
asked him. 

“Yes, Osa. So far.” 

“I’m sorry.” She turned her 
glass around, but did not lift it. 
“I mean maybe you don’t want to 
talk about Dick.” 

“You’re very thoughtful,” he 
said, and wondered why it had 
never occurred to him to see her 
just for himself. “But you’re 
wrong. I did want you to talk 
about him.” 

“Well ... if you like, Fred. 
What, especially?” 

He laughed. “I don’t know. 
Isn’t that silly?” 



THE OTHER MAN 



35 



He sipped his drink. He was 
aware that she did the same. They 
never used to say “cheers” or 
“skoal” or anything else, but they 
always took that first sip together. 

He said, “I need something that 
segmentation or hypnosis or nar- 
cosynthesis just won’t give me. I 
need to flesh out a skeleton. No, 
it’s more refined than that. I need 
tints for a charcoal portrait.” He 
lifted his hands and put them 
down again. “I don’t know what 
I need. I’ll tell you when I get it.” 
“Well, of course I’ll help if I 
can,” she said uncertainly. 

“All right. Just talk, then. Try 
to forget who I am.” 

H E met her eyes and the ques- 
tion there, and elaborated, 
“Forget I’m his therapist, Osa. I’m 
an interested stranger who has 
never seen him, and you’re telling 
me about him.” 

“Engineering degree, and where 
he comes from, and how many 
sisters?” 

“No,” he said, “but keep that 
up. You’re bound to stumble 
across what I want that way.” 
“Well, he’s . he’s been sick. 
I think I’d tell a stranger that.” 
“Good! What do you mean, 
sick?” 

She glanced quickly at him and 
he could follow the thought be- 
hind it: Why don’t you tell me 
how sick he is? And then, But you 
really want to play this game of 

36 



the interested stranger. All right. 

She stopped looking at him and 
said, “Sick. He can’t be steered by 
anything but his own — pressures 
and they — they aren’t the pres- 
sures he should have. Not for this 
world.” 

“Why do you suppose that is?” 

“He just doesn’t seem to care. 
No,” she denied forcefully, “I 
don’t mean that, not at all. It’s 
more like — I think he would care 
if he — if he was allowed to, and 
he isn’t allowed to.” She got his 
eyes again. “This is very hard to 
do, Fred.” 

“I know and I’m sorry. But do 
go on; you’re doing fine. What do 
you mean, he isn’t allowed to care 
about the world and the way it 
wags? Who won’t allow him?” 

“It isn’t a who; it’s a — I don’t 
know. You’d have a term for it. 
I’d call it a monster on his back, 
something that drives him to do 
things, be something he really 
isn’t.” 

“We strangers don’t have any 
terms for anything,” he reminded 
her gently. 

“That’s a little refreshing,” she 
said with a wan half-smile. “I like 
. mystified . people. They 
make me feel like one of the 
crowd. You know who’s lucky?” 
she asked, her voice suddenly 
wild and strained and, by its tone, 
changing the subject. “Psychotics 
are lucky. The nuts, the real 
buggy ones. (I talk like this to 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



layman strangers.) The ones who 
see butterflies all the time, the 
ones who think the President is 
after them.” 

“Lucky!” he exploded. 

“Y es, lucky. They have a name 
for the beast that’s chewing on 
them. Sometimes they can see it 
themselves.” 

“I don’t quite 

“I mean this,” she said excit- 
edly. “If I see grizzly bears under 
every lamp post, I’m seeing some- 
thing. It has a name, a shape; I 
could draw a picture of it. If I 
do something irrational, the way 
some psychos do — run a nonexis- 
tent railroad or shoot invisible 
pheasant with an invisible gun, 
I’m doing something. I can de- 
scribe it and say how it feels and 
write letters about it. See, these 
are all things plaguing the insane. 
Labels, handles. Things that you 
can hold up to reality to demon- 
strate that they don’t coincide 
with it.” 

“And that’s lucky?” 

S HE nodded miserably. “A mere 
neurotic — Dick, for example 
— hasn’t a thing he can name. He 
acts in ways we call irrational, 
and has a sense of values nobody 
can understand, and does things 
in a way that seems consistent to 
him but not to anyone else. It’s 
as if there were a grizzly bear, af- 
ter all, but we’d never heard of 
grizzly bears — what they are, 



what they want, how they act. 
He’s driven by some monster 
without a name, something that 
no one can see and that even he 
is not aware of. That’s what I 
mean.” 

“Ah.” 

They sat for minutes, silent 
and careful. 

Then, “Osa-” 

“Yes, Fred.” 

“Why do you love him?” 

She looked at him. “You really 
meant it when you said this would 
be a painful conversation.” 
“Never mind that. Just tell me.” 
“I don’t think it’s a thing you 
can tell.” 

“Then try this: What is it you 
love in him?” 

She made a helpless gesture. 
“Him.” 

He sat without responding un- 
til he knew she felt his dissatis- 
faction with the answer. 

She frowned and then closed 
her eyes. “I couldn’t make you 
understand, Fred. To understand, 
you’d have to be two things: a 
woman, and — Osa.” Still he sat 
silent. Twice she looked up to his 
face and away, and at last yielded. 

She said in a low voice, “It’s a 
. tenderness you wouldn’t be- 
lieve, no matter how well you 
know him. It’s a gentle, loving 
something that no one ever born 
ever had before and never will 
again. It’s ... I hate this, Fred!” 
“Go on, for heaven’s sake! This 



THE OTHER MAN 



37 



is exactly what I’m looking for.” 
“It is? Well, then . But I hate 
talking like this to you. It doesn’t 
seem right.” 

“Go on/” 

She said, almost in a whisper, 
“Life is plain hell sometimes. He’s 
gone and I don’t know where, and 
he comes back and it’s just awful. 
Sometimes he acts as if he were 
alone in the place — he doesn’t see 
me, doesn’t answer. Or maybe 
he’ll be the other way, after me 
every second, teasing and prod- 
ding and twisting every word un- 
til I don’t know what I said or 
what I should say next, or who I 
am, or . anything, and he won’t 
leave me alone, not to eat or to 
sleep or to go out. And then he — ” 
She stopped and the doctor 
waited, and this time realized that 
waiting would not be enough. 
“Don’t stop,” he said. 

She shook her head. 

“Please. It’s impor — ” 

“I would, Fred,” she burst out 
frantically. “I’m not refusing to. 
I can’t, that’s all. The words 
won’t — ” 

“Don’t try to tell me what it is, 
then,” he suggested. “Just say 
what happens and how it makes 
you feel. You can do that.” 

“I suppose so,” she said, after 
considering it. 

/'kSA took a deep breath, al- 
most a sigh, and closed her 
eyes again. 

38 



“It will be hell,” she said, “and 
then I’ll look at him and he . 
and he . well, it’s there, that’s 
all. Not a word, not a sign some- 
times, but the room is full of it. 
It’s . it’s something to love, yes, 
it’s that, but nobody can just love 
something, one-way, forever. So 
it’s a loving thing, too, from him 
to me. It suddenly arrives and 
everything else he is doing, the 
cruelty, the ignoring, whatever 
might be happening just then, it 
all stops and there’s nothing else 
but the — whatever it is.” 

She wet her lips. “It can hap- 
pen any time; there’s never a sign 
or a warning. It can happen now, 
and again a minute from now, or 
not for months. It can last most of 
a day or flash by like a bird. 
Sometimes he goes on talking to 
me while it happens; sometimes 
what he actually says is just noth- 
ing, small-talk. Sometimes he just 
stands looking at me, without say- 
ing anything. Sometimes he — I’m 
sorry, Fred — he makes love to me 
then and that’s . Oh, dear God, 
that’s . .” 

“Here’s my handkerchief.” 

“Thank you. He — does that 
other times, too, when there’s 
nothing loving about it. This — 
this thing-to-love, it — it seems to 
have nothing to do with anything 
else, no pattern. It happens and 
it’s what I wait for and what I 
look back on; it’s all I have and 
all I want.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



When he was quite sure she 
had no more to say, he hazarded, 
“It’s as if some other — some other 
personality suddenly took over.” 

He was quite unprepared for 
her reaction. She literally shouted, 
“No!” and was startled herself. 

She recoiled and glanced guilt- 
ily around the cafe. “I don’t know 
why,” she said, sounding fright- 
ened, “but that was just — just aw- 
ful, what you said. Fred, if you 
can give any slightest credence to 
the idea of feminine intuition, 
you’ll get that idea right out of 
your head. I couldn’t begin to tell 
you why, but it just isn’t so. What 
loves me that way may be part of 
Dick, but it’s Dick, not anybody 
or anything else. I know that’s so, 
that’s all. I know it.” 

Her gaze was so intense that 
it all but made him wince. He 
could see her trying and trying to 
find words, rejecting and trying 
again. 

At last, “The only way I can 
say it that makes any sense to me 
is that Dick could be such a — a 
louse so much of the time and 
still walk a straight line without 
something just as extreme in the 
other direction. It’s — it’s a great 
pity for the rest of the world that 
he only shows that side to me, but 
there it is.” 

“Does he show it only to you?” 
He touched her hand and re- 
leased it. “I’m sorry, but I must 
ask that.” 



She smiled and a kind of pride 
shone from her face. “Only to me. 
I suppose that’s intuition again, 
but it’s as certain as Sunday.” The 
pride disappeared and was re- 
placed by a patient agony. “I 
don’t delude myself, Fred— he has 
other women; plenty of them. But 
that particular something is for 
me. It isn’t something I wonder 
about. I just — know.” 

He sat back wearily. 

S HE asked, “Is all this what you 
wanted?” 

He gave her a quick, hurt 
glance and saw, to his horror, her 
eyes filling with tears. 

“It’s what I asked for,” he said 
in a flat voice. 

“I see the difference.” She used 
his handkerchief. “May I have 
this?” 

“You can have—” But he 
stopped himself. “Sure.” He got 
up. “No,” he said, and took the 
damp handkerchief out of her 
hand. “I’ll have something better 
for you.” 

“Fred,” she said, distressed, 

it J » 

“I’m going, forgive me and all 
that,” he said, far more angrily 
than he had thought he would. 
But polite talk and farewells were 
much more than he could stand. 
“The layman stranger has to have 
a long interview with a profes- 
sional acquaintance. I don’t think 
I’d better see you again, Osa.” 



THE OTHER MAN 



39 



“All right, Fred,” she said to 
his back. 

He had hurt her, he knew, but 
he knew also that his stature in 
her cosmos could overshadow the 
hurt and a hundred more like it. 
He luxuriated in the privilege and 
stamped out, throwing a bill to 
the waiter on the way. 

He drove back and plodded up 
the ramp to the clinic. For some 
obscure reason, the inscription 
over the door caught his atten- 
tion. He had passed it hundreds 
of times without a glance; he had 
ordered it put there and he was 
satisfied with it, and why should it 
matter now? But it did. What was 
it that Newell had said about it? 
Some saw about the sanctity of 
personality. A very perceptive re- 
mark, thought the doctor, consid- 
ering that Newell hadn’t read it: 

ONLY MAN CAN FATHOM 
MAN 

It was from Robert Lindner 
and was the doctor’s answer to 
the inevitable charges of “push- 
button therapy.” But he wondered 
.now if the word “Man” was really 
inclusive enough. 

He shook off the conjecture 
and let himself into the building. 

Light gleamed from the trans- 
lucent door of his office at the far 
end of the corridor. He walked 
down the slick flooring toward it, 
listening to his heels and not 

40 



thinking otherwise, his mind as 
purposively relaxed as a fighter’s 
body between rounds. He opened 
the door. 

“What are you doing?” 
“Waiting,” said Miss Thomas. 
“Why?” 

“Just in case.” 

W ITHOUT answering, he went 
to the closet and hung up 
his coat. Back at his desk, he sat 
down and straightened his tired 
spine until it crackled. Then he 
looked at Miss Thomas in the big 
chair. She put her feet under her 
and he understood that she was 
ready to leave if he wished her to. 

He said, “Hypothesis: Newell 
and Anson are discrete personali- 
ties.” 

While he spoke, he noticed 
Miss Thomas’s feet move outward 
a little and then cross at the an- 
kles. His inner thought was, Of 
all the things I like about this 
woman, the best is the amount of 
conversation I have with her 
without talking. 

“And we have plenty of data to 
back that up,” he continued. “The 
EEGs alone prove it. Anson is 
Anson and Newell is Newell, and 
to prove it, we’ve crystallized 
them for anyone to see. We’ve 
done such a job on them that we 
know exactly what Anson is like 
without Newell. 'We’ve built him 
up that way, with that in mind. 
We haven’t done quite the same 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



with Newell, but we might as well 
have. I mean we’ve investigated 
Newell as if Anson did not exist 
within him. What it amounts to 
is this: In order to demonstrate a 
specimen of multiple personality, 
we’ve separated and isolated the 
components. 

“Then we go into a flat spin be- 
cause neither segment looks like 
a real human being . Miss 
Thomas?” 

“Yes?” 

“Do you mind the way I keep 
on saying ‘we’?” 

She smiled and shook her head. 
“Not at the moment” 

“Further,” he said, answering 
her smile but relentlessly pursu- 
ing his summation, “we’ve taken 
our two personalities and treated 
each like a potentially salvable 
patient — one neurotic, one re- 
tarded. We’ve operated under the 
assumption that each contained 
his own disorder and could be 
treated by separate therapies.” 
“We’ve been wrong?” 

“7 certainly have,” said the doc- 
tor. He slapped the file cabinet at 
his left. “In here, there’s a very 
interesting paper by one Weis- 
baden, who theorizes that multi- 
ple personalities are actually 
twins, identical twins bom of the 
same egg-cell and developing 
within one body. One step, as it 
were, into the microcosm from 
foetus in foetu.” 

“I’ve read about that,” said 



Miss Thomas. “One twin bom en- 
closed in the body of another.” 
“But not just partly— altogether 
enclosed. Whether or not Weisba- 
den’s right, it’s worth using as a 
test hypothesis. That’s what I’ve 
been doing, among other things, 
and I’ve had my nose stuck so far 
into it that I wasn’t able to see a 
very important corresponding 
part of the analogy: namely, that 
twinning itself is an anomaly, and 
any deviation in a sibling of mul- 
tiple origin is teratological.” 
“My,” said Miss Thomas in 
mock admiration. 

T HE doctor smiled. “I should 
have said ‘monstrous,’ but why 
drag in superstitions? This thing 
is bad enough already. Anyway, 
if we’re to carry our twinning idea 
as an analogy, we have got to in- 
clude the very likely possibility 
that our multiple personalities are 
as abnormal as Siamese twins or 
any other monstrosity — I hate to 
use that word!” 

“I’m not horrified,” said Miss 
Thomas. “Abnormal in what 
way?” 

“Well, in the crudest possible 
terms, what would you say was 
the abnormality suffered by one 
Siamese twin?” 

“The other Siamese twin.” 
“Mmm. And by the same anal- 
ogy, what’s the name of Newell’s 
disorder?” 

“My goodness!” gasped Miss

Thomas. “We better not tell 
Hildy Jarrell.” 

“That isn’t the only thing we’ll 
have to keep from her — for a 
while, at least,” said the doctor. 
“Listen: did you run my notes on 
Newell?” 

“All of them.” 

“You remember the remark she 
made that bothered me, about 
Anson’s being only and altogether 
good, and the trouble I had with 
the implication that Newell was 
only and altogether bad?” 

“I remember it.” 

“It’s a piece of childishness that 
annoys me wherever I find it and 
I was damned annoyed to be 
thinking at all along those lines. 
The one reason for its being in 
the notes at all is that I had to 
decant it somewhere. Well, I’ve 
been euchred, Miss Thomas. Be- 
cause Anson appeared in our 
midst shining and unsullied, I’ve 
leaned over backward trying to 
keep away from him the corrup- 
tions of anger, fear, greed, concu- 
piscence and all the other hobbies 
of real mankind. By the same 
token, it never occurred to me to 
analyze what kindness, generosity, 
sympathy or empathy might be 
lurking in Newell. Why bother in 
such a — what was the term you 
used?” 

“Heel,” said Miss Thomas with- 
out hesitation. 

“Heel. So what we have to do 
first is to give each of these — uh 

42 



— people the privilege of entirety. 
If they are monsters, then let us 
at least permit them to be whole 
monsters.” 

“You don’t mean you’ll — ” 
“We,” he corrected, smiling. 
She said, through her answer- 
ing smile, “You don’t mean we’ll 
take poor Anson and — ” 

He nodded. 

“Offhand, I don’t see how you’re 
going to do it, Doctor. Anson has 
no fear. He’d laugh as he walked 
into a lion’s cage or a high-tension 
line. And I can’t imagine how 
you’d make him angry. You of 
all people. He — he loves you. As 
for . oh, dear. This is awful.” 
“Extremes are awful,” he 
agreed. “We’ll have to get pretty 
basic, but we can do it. Hence, I 
suggest Miss Jarrell be sent to 
Kalamazoo for a new stove or 
some such.” 

“And then what?” 

“It is standard practice to ac- 
quaint a patient with the name 
and nature of his disorder. In our 
field, we don’t tell him, we show 
him, and when he absorbs the in- 
formation, we call it an insight. 
Anson, meet Newell. Newell, meet 
Anson.” 

“I do hope they’ll be friends,” 
said Miss Thomas unhappily. 

TN a darkness within a darkness 
in the dark, Anson slept his 
new kind of sleep, wherein he now 
had dreams. And then there was

his own music, the deep sound 
which lit the darkness and pierced 
the dark envelopes, one within 
the other; and now he could 
emerge to the light and laughter 
and the heady mysteries of life 
and communication with Miss 
Hildy and Doctor Fred, and the 
wonder on wonder of perception. 
Gladly he flung himself back to 
life to — 

But this wasn’t the same. He 
was here, in the bed, but it wasn’t 
the same at all. There was no rim 
of light around the ceiling, no 
bars of gold pouring in a sunlit 
window; this was the same, but 
not the same — it was dark. He 
blinked his eyes so hard, he made 
little colored lights, but they were 
inside his eyes and did not count. 

r T , HERE was noise, unheard-of, 
unbearable noise in the form 
of a cymbal-crash right by his 
head in the dark. He recoiled 
from it and tried to bounce up 
and run, and found he could not 
move. His arms were bound to 
his sides, his legs to the bed, by 
some wide formless something 
which held him trapped. He 
fought against it, crying, and then 
the bed dropped away under- 
neath him and stopped with a 
crash, and rose and dropped again. 
There was another noise — not a 
noise, though it struck at him like 
one: this was a photo-flash, though 
he could not know it.

Blinded and sick, he lay in ter- 
ror, waiting for terror again. 

He heard a voice say softly, 
“Turn down the gain,” and his 
music, his note, the pervasive 
background to all his conscious- 
ness, began to weaken. He strained 
toward it and it receded from 
him. Thumpings and shufflings 
from somewhere in the dark 
threatened to hide it away from 
him altogether. He felt, without 
words, that the note was his life 
and that he was losing it. For the 
first time in his conscious life, he 
became consciously afraid of dy- 
ing. 

He screamed, and screamed 
again, and then there was a black- 
ness blacker than the dark and it 
all ceased. 

“He’s fainted. Lights, please. 
Turn off that note. Give him 550 
and we’ll see if he can sleep nor- 
mally. God, I hope we didn’t go 
too far.” 

They stood watching the pa- 
tient. They were panting with 
tension. 

“Help me with this,” said the 
doctor. Together, he and Miss 
Thomas unbuckled the restrain- 
ing sheet. They cleared away the 
flash-gun, the cymbals, and read- 
justed the bed-raising control to 
its normal slow operation. 

“He’s all right, physically any- 
way,” said the doctor after a swift 
examination. “I told you it would 
work if we got basic enough. He

wouldn’t fear a lion because he 
doesn’t know what a lion is. But 
restraint and sudden noise and 
falling — he doesn’t have to know 
what they are. Okay, button him 
up again.” 

“What? You’re not going to—” 

“Come on, button him up,” he 
said brusquely. 

She frowned, but she helped 
him replace the restraining sheet. 
“I still think—” she began, and 
earned a “Sh!” 

H E set up the 200-cycle note 
again at its usual amplitude 
and they waited. There was a lag 
in apparent consciousness this 
time. The doctor realized that the 
patient was awake, but appar- 
ently afraid to open his eyes. 
“Anson . .” 

Anson began to cry weakly. 
“What’s the matter, Anson?” 
“D-doctor Fred, Doctor Fred . 
the big noise, and then I couldn’t 
move and all the black and white 
smash lights.” He wept again. 

The doctor said nothing. He 
simply waited. Anson’s sobs 
stopped abruptly and he tried to 
move. He gasped loudly and tried 
again. 

“Doctor Fred!” he cried in 
panic. 

Still the doctor said nothing. 
Anson rolled his head wildly, 
fell back, tried again. “Make it so 
I can get up,” Anson called pite- 
ously. 



“No,” said the doctor flatly. 

“Make so I—” 

“No.” 

Piercingly, Anson shrieked. He 
surged upward so powerfully that 
for a second the doctor was afraid 
for the fastenings on the restrain- 
ing sheet. But they held. 

For nearly ten minutes, Anson 
fought the sheet, screaming and 
drooling. Fright turned to fury, 
and fury to an intense, witless 
battle. It was a childish tantrum 
magnified by the strength and 
staying power of an adult. 

At about the second minute, 
the doctor keyed in a supplemen- 
tary frequency, a shrill 10,500 
cycles which had been blank on 
the index. Whenever Anson 
paused for breath, the doctor in- 
toned, “You are angry. You are 
angry.” Grimly he watched until, 
a matter of seconds before the pa- 
tient had to break, he released 
him to sleep. 

“I couldn’t stand another min- 
ute of that,” said Miss Thomas. 
Her lips were almost gray. She 
moistened a towel and gently 
bathed the sleeping face. “I didn’t 
like that at all.” 

“You’ll like the rest of it,” 
promised the doctor. “Let’s get 
rid of this sheet.” 

They took it off and stored it. 

“How’d you like me to hit the 
ten-five cycles with that sheet 
off?” he asked. 

“Build him a cage first,” she 



THE OTHER MAN 



45 



breathed in an awed tone. 

He grinned suddenly. “Hit 
eighty cycles for me, will you?” 

CHE did and they watched Rich- 
^ ard Newell wakening. He 
groaned and moved his head gin- 
gerly. He sat up suddenly and 
yelped, and covered his face for 
a moment with both hands. 

“Hello, Newell. How do you 
feel?” 

“Fred! What’ve you been doing 
to me?” 

“How do you feel?” 

“Like the output of a garbage 
disposal unit. I haven’t felt like 
this since the day I rowed a boat 
for fourteen hours.” 

“It’s all right, Newell. All in a 
day’s work.” 

“Work is right. I know — you’ve 
had me out pulling a plow while 
I was hypnotized. Slave labor. 
Lowers the overhead. Damn it, 
Fred, I’m not going to take much 
more of this.” 

“You’ll take as much as I 
choose to give you,” snapped the 
doctor. “This is my party now, 
Dicky-boy.” 

Miss Thomas gasped. Newell 
slowly swung his legs out and sat 
looking at the doctor, an omi- 
nous and ugly half-smile on his 
face. 

“Miss Thomas,” said the doc- 
tor, “ten-five, please.” 

With his amusement deeply 
concealed, he watched Miss 

46 



Thomas sidle to the controls and 
dial for the 10,500 supplemen- 
tary note. He knew exactly what 
was going on in her mind. Ten- 
five was a fury motif, the com- 
mand to Anson to relive the state 
of unbearable anger he had been 
in just moments ago. 

“Miss Thomas,” said Newell 
silkily, “did I ever tell you the 
story of my life? Or, for that mat- 
ter, the story of the doctor’s life?” 
“Why -no, Mr. Newell.” 

“Once upon a time,” said New- 
ell, “there was a doctor who . 
who . .” As the shrill note added 
itself to the bumble of the 80- 
cycle tone, Newell’s voice faltered. 
Behind him, the doctor heard the 
rustle of Miss Thomas’s starch 
as she braced herself. 

Newell looked at the doctor 
with astonishment. “What the hell 
am I up to?” he murmured. “That 
isn’t a funny story. ’Scuse me, 
Miss Thomas.” He visibly relaxed, 
swung his feet back up on the 
bed and rested on one elbow. “I 
haven’t felt like this since . 
Where’s Osa?” he asked. 

“Home. Waiting for you.” 

“God. Hope she doesn’t have to 
wait much longer. Is she all 
right?” 

“She’s fine. So are you, pretty 
near. I think we have the thing 
whipped. Like to hear about it?” 
“ ‘Talk about me,’ ” Newell 
quoted. “‘Talk nice if you can, 
but talk about me.’ ” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



T HE doctor saw Miss Thomas 
staring incredulously at the 
controls, checking to be sure she 
had keyed the right note. He 
laughed. Newell laughed with 
him; it was one of the most pleas- 
ant of imaginable sounds. And it 
wasn’t Anson’s laugh, either — not 
even remotely. This was Richard 
Newell to the life, but warm, re- 
sponsive, considerate. 

The doctor said, “Did Osa ever 
tell you she thought you had a 
nameless monster pushing you 
around?” 

“Only a couple hundred times.” 
“Well, you have. I’m not joking, 
Dick — you really have. Only 
you’ve never suspected it and you 
don’t have a name to call it by.” 
“I don’t get you.” He was curi- 
ous, anxious to learn, to like and 
be liked. It was in the way he 
spoke, moved, listened. Miss 
Thomas stood with her hand 
frozen near the controls, ready to 
shut him off at the first sign of 
expected violence. 

“You will. Now here’s the pic- 
ture.” And in simple terms, the 
doctor told him the story of An- 
son, the theory of multiple per- 
sonality as a phenomenon of twin- 
ning, and at last his theory of the 
acrobatic stabilization the two en- 
tities had achieved on their own. 
“Why acrobatic?” asked Newell. 
“You know you act like a heel 
most of the time, Dick.” 

“You might say so.” It was said 



quite without resentment. 

“Here’s why. (Just listen, now; 
you can test it any way you like 
after you’ve heard it all.) Your 
alter ego (to coin a phrase) had 
been walled in, excluded from 
consciousness and expression and 
even self-awareness, ever since 
you were bom. I won’t attempt to 
explain that; I don’t know. Any- 
way, there it lay, isolated but 
alive, Dick, alive — and just as 
strong as you!” 

“I . can’t picture such a 
thing.” 

“It isn’t easy. I can’t either, 
completely. It’s like trying to get 
into the mind of another species, 
or a plant, if you can imagine 
such a thing. I do know, though, 
that the thing is alive, and up un- 
til recently had nothing — no 
knowledge, no retained experi- 
ence, no mode of expression at 
all.” 

“How do you know it’s there, 
then?” 

“It’s there all right,” said the 
doctor. “And right this very min- 
ute, it’s blowing its top. You see, 
all your life it’s lived with you. It 
has had a blind, constant urge to 
break through, and it never could 
make it until it popped up here 
and we drew it out. It’s a fasci- 
nating entity, Dick. I won’t go 
into that now; you’ll know it — 
him— thoroughly before you leave. 
But believe it or not, it’s pretty 
nice. More than nice: it’s posi-

tively angelic. It’s lain there in 
the dark all these years like a ger- 
minated seed, pushing up toward 
the light. And every time it came 
near — you batted it down again.” 

“I did?” 

“For good sound survival rea- 
sons, you did. But like a lot of 
survival impulses, yours was 
pretty irrational. A lion roars, a 
deer runs. Good survival. But if 
he runs over a cliff? What I’m get- 
ting at is that there’s room for 
both of you in Richard Anson 
Newell. You’ve coexisted fairly 
well, considering, as strangers and 
sometime enemies. You’re going 
to do a lot better as friends and 
partners. Brothers, if you want 
the true term, because that’s just 
what the two of you are.” 

“How does this — if true — ex- 
plain the way I’ve been mucking 
around with my life?” 

T OOKING for an image, the 
doctor paused. “You might 
say you’ve been cantilevered out 
from a common center. Way out. 
Now your alter — we call him An- 
son— is, as I’ve said, a very nice 
fellow. His blind stragglings have 
been almost all toward something 
— call it an aura, if you like — in 
people around you. The pressures 
are everything that’s warm and 
lovable and good to be with. 

“But you — man, you felt in- 
vaded! You could never reach out 
toward anything; Anson was there 

48 



ahead of you, pressing and grop- 
ing. You had to react, immedi- 
ately and with all your might, in 
the opposite direction. Isn’t it true 
that all your life you’ve rejected 
and tramped on anything that at- 
tracted you — and at the same 
time you’ve taken only things you 
couldn’t really care about?” 

“Well, I ...” 

“Just hold onto the idea. This 
speech I’m making is for your 
intellectual understanding; I don’t 
expect you to buy it first crack 
out of the barrel.” 

“But I haven’t always ... I 
mean what about Osa? Are you 
telling me I didn’t really want 
Osa?” 

“That’s the cantilever effect, 
Dick. Anson never felt about Osa 
the way you did. I think she must 
have some confining effect on 
him; he doesn’t like to be con- 
fined, does he. Miss Thomas?” He 
chuckled. “She either leaves him 
cold or makes him angry. So 
angry that it’s beyond belief. But 
it’s an infant’s anger, Dick — blind 
and furious and extreme. And 
what happens then, when you re- 
act in the opposite direction?” 

“Oh, my God,” breathed New- 
ell. “Osa . .” He turned his sud- 
denly illuminated gaze up. “You 
know, sometimes I — we — it’s like 
a big light that . .” 

“I know, I know,” said the doc- 
tor testily. “Matter of fact, that’s 
happening right now. Turn off the

ten-five, please, Miss Thomas.” 
“Yes, Doctor.” 

“That high note,” the doctor ex- 
plained. “It’s for Anson — induced 
anger. You’re being pretty de- 
cent at the moment, Newell. You 
realize that?” 

“Well, why wouldn’t I? You’ve 
done a lot for me.” 

The note faded. Newell closed 
his eyes and opened them again. 
There was a long, tense silence. 

Finally Newell said in his most 
softly insulting tone, “You spin a 
pretty tale, Freddy-boy. But I’m 
tired of listening. Shall I black- 
mail you the hell out of here?” 
“Five-fifty, Miss Thomas.” 
“Yes, Doctor.” She turned New- 
ell off. 

T> ACK in the office again. Miss 
Thomas jittered in indecision. 
She tried to speak and then looked 
at the doctor with mute pleading. 
“Go ahead,” he encouraged. 
She shook her head. “I don’t 
know what comes next. Morton 
Prince was wrong; there are no 
multiple egos, just multiple sib- 
lings sharing the same body, the 
same brain.” She halted, waiting 
for him to take it from there. 
“Well?” he said. 

“I know you’re not going to 
sacrifice one for the other; that’s 
why you never handled these 
cases before. But — ” she flapped 
her hands helplessly — “even if 
Newell could carry the equipment 



around, I’d never sleep nights, 
thinking that Anson had to go 
through the agony of that ten-five 
note just so Newell would be a 
decent human being. Or even, for 
that matter, vice versa.” 

“It wouldn’t be either humane 
or practical,” he said. “Well?” 
“Do they take turns being dom- 
inant, one day on, one day off?” 
“That still would be sacrificing 
each half the time.” 

“Then what? You said it would 
be ‘Newell, meet Anson. Anson, 
meet Newell.’ But you don’t have 
the same problem you’d have with 
Siamese twins or the same solu- 
tion.” 

“Which is?” 

“Separating them without kill- 
ing either one. All these two have 
is a single brain to share and a 
single body. If you could cut them 
free -” 

“I can’t,” he said bluntly. “I 
don’t intend to.” 

“All right,” she conceded in de- 
feat. “You’re the doctor. You tell 

__ M 

me. 

“Just what you said — the Mor- 
ton Prince cases were in commu- 
nication.” 

“And Newell and Anson are, 
just because we gave Anson a vo- 
cabulary? What about that canti- 
lever effect you explained to New- 
ell? You can’t let them go through 
life counterbalancing each other 
— Newell pulling violently to the 
other side of Anson’s reactions, 



THE OTHER MAN 



49 



Anson doing the same with New- 
ell’s. Then what?” she repeated al- 
most angrily. “If you know, why 
put me through this guessing 
game?” 

“To see if you’d come up with 
the same answer,” he said can- 
didly. “A check on my judgment. 
Do you mind?” 

She shook her head again, but 
this time with a little complimen- 
tary smile. “It’s a painful way to 
get cooperation, only it works, 
damn you.” She frowned then, 
considering. “The two of them are 
compartmented. Are they differ- 
ent in that way from the other 
multiples?” 

“Some, yes — the ones that are 
detected because there is commu- 
nication. But not the others. And 
those cases rate treatment (be- 
cause all people in difficulty do) 
and Newell-Anson, if we work it 
out properly, will show us how to 
help them. There’s an obvious 
answer, Miss Thomas. I’m hoping 
— almost desperately — that you 
come up with the one I thought 
of.” 

S HE made a self-impatient ges- 
ture. “ Not the psychostat. 
Definitely not eliminating one or 
the other. Not making them take 
turns.” She looked up with a ques- 
tioning awe on her face. “The op- 
posite of treating Siamese twins?” 
“Like what?” he asked urgently, 
leaning forward. 

so 



“Don’t separate them. Join 
them. Make a juncture.” 

“Keep going,” he pressed. “Don’t 
stop now.” 

“Surgical?” 

“Can’t be done. It isn’t one lobe 
for Newell, the other for Anson, 
or anything that simple. What 
else?” 

She thought deeply, began sev- 
eral times to say something, dis- 
missed each intended suggestion 
with a curt head-shake. He waited 
with equally deep intensity. 

She nodded at last. “Modulate 
them separately.” She was no 
longer asking. “Then modulate 
them in relation to each other so 
they won’t be in that awful canti- 
lever balancing act.” 

“Say it!” he nearly yelled. 

“But that isn’t enough.” 

“No!” 

“Audio response.” 

“Why?” he rapped out. “And 
which?” 

“Sixty cycles — the AC tone 
they’ll be hearing almost all the 
time. Assign it to communication 
between them.” 

The doctor slumped into a 
chair, drained of tension. He 
nodded at her, with the tiredest 
grin she had ever seen. 

“All of it,” he whispered. “You 
got everything I thought of . 
including the 60 cycles. I knew I 
was right. Now I know it. Or 
doesn’t that make sense?” 

“Of course it does.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Then let’s get started.” 
“Now?” she asked, astonished. 
“You’re too tired — ” 

“Am I?” He jacked himself out 
of the chair. “Try stopping me 
and see.” 

T HEY used the EEG resul- 
tants, made two analogs and 
another, and used all three as the 
optimum standard for the final 
fixing process in the psychostat. It 
was a longer, more meticulous 
process than it had ever been and 
it worked; and what shook the 
doctor’s hand that last day was 
an unbelievable blend — all of 
Newell’s smoothness and a new 
strength, the sum of powers he 
had previously exhausted in the 
dual struggle that neither had 
known of; and, with it, Anson’s 
bright fascination with the very 
act of drawing breath, seeing col- 
ors, finding wonderment in every- 
thing. 

“We’re nice guys,” said Richard 
Anson Newell, still shaking the 
doctor’s hand. “We’ll get along 
great.” 

“I don’t doubt it a bit,” the 
doctor said. “Give my best to Osa. 
Tell her . here’s something a 
little better than a wet handker- 
chief.” 

“Whatever you say,” said Rich- 
ard Anson Newell. 

He waved to Miss Thomas, 
who watched from the corridor, 
and behind her, Hildy Jarrell, 



who wept, and he went down the 
steps to the street. 

“We’re making a mistake, Doc- 
tor,” said Miss Thomas, “letting 
him — them — go.” 

“Why?” he asked, curious. 

“All that brain power packed 
in one skull . .” 

The doctor wanted to laugh. He 
didn’t. “You’d think so, wouldn’t 
you?” he agreed. 

“Meaning it’s not so at all,” she 
said suspiciously. “Why not?” 
“Because it isn’t twice the 
amount of brains any individual 
has. It’s only as much as any two 
distinct individuals have. Like 
you and me, for instance. Mostly 
we supplement each other — but 
just here and there, not every- 
where, adding up to a giant dou- 
ble brain. Same with Newell and 
Anson. And any two people can 
be counted on to jam one another 
occasionally. So will they — but 
not like before treatment.” 

They watched until Richard 
Anson Newell was out of sight, 
then went back to check the mul- 
tiple personality cases that Miss 
Jarrell had dug out of the files. 

T^OUR months later, the doctor 
got a letter: 

Dear Fred, 

I’ll write this because it will do 
me good to get it off my chest. If it 
doesn’t do enough good, I’ll send it. 
If that doesn’t help, I don’t know 
what I’ll do. Yes, I do. Nothing. 



THE OTHER MAN 



51 



Dick is . incredible. He takes 
care of me, Fred, in ways I’d never 
dreamed of or hoped for. He cares. 
That’s it, he cares — about me, about 
his work. He learns new things all 
the time and loves old things over 
again. It’s . could I say miracle? 

But, Fred — this is hateful of me, 
I know — the thing I told you about, 
the thing I used to wish for and live 
to remember, no matter what . it’s 
gone. That’s probably good, because 
of what happened between times. 

But sometimes I’d trade my per- 
fect husband for that louse and a 
wet handkerchief, if l could have the 



other thing along with it somehow. 

There, I’ve said it. 

Osa 

The doctor galloped through the 
clinic until he found his head tech- 
nician in the electrical lab. 

“Tommie,” he said jovially, “did 
you ever go out and get drunk 
with a doctor?” 

The tears were streaming down 
his face. Miss Thomas went out 
and got drunk with the doctor.

Nothing 

but the best 



By ALAN COGAN 



Illustrated by CAL 



If he took the high road — and 
also the low road — he'd be in 
the same place afore himself! 



C HARLES MEAD stood 
on top of Hobson’s Hill 
and stared at the town 
below, as though trying to im- 
print a permanent impression of 
the view on his memory. He 
paid particular attention to a 
wood-and-corrugated-iron con- 



struction at the bottom of the 
hill by the railroad tracks, which 
bore the sign, FINLAY’S LUM- 
BER CO. 

Well concealed in the bushes 
behind him and humming mute- 
ly were four black metal boxes 
forming a small square. Anten- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



nae sprouted from each box, 
curving inward to form an arch 
in which the light seemed to 
vibrate and shimmer. Charles 
Mead made an adjustment on 
one of the boxes and then 
stepped quickly into the shim- 
mering arch. 

Darkness smothered him im- 
mediately. There was a sudden 
terrifying sensation of weight- 
lessness, of falling. He kept push- 
ing and pushing, although there 
seemed to be nothing to push 
against except swirling, spinning 
blackness. 

Then, suddenly, he was stand- 
ing on another Hobson’s Hill. 

The four black boxes had 
gone, but the blurred arch of 
light was still there. He fell to 
his knees, clutching in terror at 
the grass, trembling and breath- 
less: the switch from one world 
to another was always unnerv- 
ing. Immediately between worlds, 
the sensation of being in no 
world, of stepping into a bottom- 
less abyss, always left him ragged 
with panic. He had not made the 
trip many times before, but he 
doubted if he would ever get used 
to it. 

r I ’’HE town looked substantially 
the same as the one he had 
just left, though he was pleased 
to note that Finlay’s Lumber Co. 
was no longer in sight. It was 
proof that he had made the 

NOTHING BUT THE BEST 



switch successfully. For some 
reason, Finlay never seemed to 
have established his business 
anywhere but in Charles Mead’s 
world. There were similar 
changes in every world — some 
large changes, some small — but 
at least Hobson’s Hill was always 
there, which was why he chose it 
as his jumping-off point. 

Charles Mead set off down 
the hill and along the highway 
into town. In a telephone booth, 
he searched the directory and 
then began walking again with 
a new eagerness in his step. 

Ten minutes later, he turned 
onto the front porch of a small, 
neat brick bungalow. He was 
about to press the bell button 
when he paused, listening. From 
inside the house, he heard voices 
yelling — a man and a woman 
— strident with anger. 

Charles Mead smiled faintly 
and rather smugly and put his 
finger to the button. The voices 
stopped yelling as the bell jan- 
gled somewhere in the house. A 
moment later, the front door 
opened and, at the same time, he 
heard a woman’s high heels 
stamping through to the back of 
the house. Then a door slammed. 

The man in the doorway wore 
moccasins, jeans and a red plaid 
shirt. Except for the general slop- 
pi ness of his dress compared with 
the unwrinkled neatness of 
Charles Mead’s expensive gray

slacks and sports jacket, the pair 
could have been twins. Both were 
slim and tall with the slightly 
stooped appearance of tall men. 
Their short, sandy hair and wide 
blue eyes gave them both a boy- 
ish look. 

“Chuck Mead?” Charles Mead 
asked. This one was sure to be 
called Chuck, he thought. 

The man nodded, frowning 
slightly. 

“Good,” said Charles. “That’s 
my name, too. May I come in?” 

He pushed his way past the 
bewildered Chuck Mead, went 
into the living room and sat 
down. 

TTE BEGAN the speech he had 
prepared. It was the first 
time he had said it aloud to any- 
one and, as he talked, he became 
painfully aware of how foolish it 
sounded. He knew that Chuck 
Mead was smiling behind the 
hand he so casually cupped over 
his chin and mouth. In the tiny 
living room with its fading fur- 
nishings, its old mahogany piano 
and the new TV, its old wedding 
pictures on the newly redecorated 
walls, talk of other worlds than 
this was hopelessly out of place. 

“Look, I’m wasting my time 
trying to explain,” Charles Mead 
said. “I want you to come with 
me. Don’t ask questions. What I 
have to show you will save hours 
of explanation.” 

NOTHING BUT THE BEST 



“What are you going to show 
me?” Chuck asked. 

“Just come with me,” Charles 
persisted. He knew it was only 
a matter of time. The bewilder- 
ing similarity between them had 
definitely aroused the other’s cu- 
riosity. He noticed that although 
Chuck Mead still smiled, it was 
an uneasy smile. 

“Okay,” Chuck said. “Anything 
for a laugh. Where do we go?” 

“Hobson’s Hill. I suppose you 
call it that in this world, too?” 

“That’s what we call it,” Chuck 
said, suppressing another grin. 
“In this world.” 

“Let’s go, then,” Charles urged, 
relieved that the toughest part 
was over. “There’s nothing to 
worry about — you’ll be com- 
pletely safe.” 

“Who’s worrying?” challenged 
his counterpart pugnaciously. 

i^H ARLES pulled Chuck 
Mead, fighting and strug- 
gling all the way, into his own 
world and together they stood 
on Hobson’s Hill, overlooking 
the town. “Scares me silly every 
time I make that crossing,” 
Charles confessed breathlessly. 

Chuck’s fingers still clutched 
his arm, digging painfully into 
the flesh as though he expected 
the ground to crumble away at 
any moment. 

“You’re okay now,” Charles 
reassured him. He pressed the 

57 



switches on the square of black 
boxes and the humming noise 
ceased. The arch collapsed. “Just 
look around you and see if this 
isn’t a different world. You’ll no- 
tice we have a Finlay’s Lumber 
Company here, which you don’t 
have in your world. That’s only 
one minor difference. Come on 
home with me and I’ll give you 
all the proof you could want.” 
Charles Mead’s home was a 
spacious villa set well back from 
the road in pleasant handsomely 
kept grounds. They went inside 
and Charles led the way upstairs 
to the den, a bright, paneled room 
at the back of the house. 

“Nice place,” Chuck said, awed. 
“I suppose it is,” Charles 
agreed. “Sit down. We’ve got a 
lot to talk about.” 

He poured drinks from a well- 
stocked cabinet and settled in an 
easy chair. “Now, then, I want to 
know if you’re really convinced 
of this business of other worlds.” 
“Sure,” Chuck said, “unless 
you’ve got me doped or hypno- 
tized or I’m dreaming or some- 
thing. It all seems real enough.” 
“It is real.” Ice cubes clicked 
as Charles tilted his glass and 
drank. “Now let’s get down to 
business. Just listen to what I 
have to say and don’t interrupt. 
I want you to think for a mo- 
ment about those times in your 
life when you’ve had to make a 
decision or choose between two 



alternative courses of action 
which would affect your whole 
life. Have you ever wondered, 
when you’ve made your choice, 
what would have happened if 
you had chosen the other alter- 
native? For instance, if you ar- 
rived at a situation where two 
jobs were available and you 
chose one, wouldn’t you some- 
times wonder how things would 
have been if you had chosen the 
other job? 

“I think I can show you,” he 
continued, “that when we reach 
such situations and finally select 
a course of action, we also take 
the other course at the same 
time. I’m going to try to prove 
to you that an alternative world 
somehow comes into existence in 
which you live your other life. 
As a matter of fact, you and I 
sprang from one of these decisive 
moments. I’m pretty sure I know 
which one, too.” 

TTE CUT short his guest’s pro- 
tests with a quick wave of 
his hand. “You really can’t argue 
with me about it. You’ve seen 
two worlds already — surely you 
don’t think it ends there? After 
all, we live in an infinite uni- 
verse; why shouldn’t we be in- 
finite creatures living out the in- 
finite possibilities of our lives? 
Still, to return to you and me — 
your wife’s name is Kathy, isn’t 
it?” 



58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Yeah. Is yours?” 

“My wife is called Estelle. 
Does that mean anything to 
you?” 

Chuck put down his drink and 
straightened suddenly. “You mean 
Estelle Defoe?” 

“That’s right. If you want to 
make sure we’re talking about 
the same girl, go look out the 
window.” 

Chuck stood up and leaned 
over the sill. Outside, surrounded 
by the close-trimmed green lawn, 
was a swimming pool. Beside the 
pool, a shapely blonde was 
stretched out face down on a 
red towel like some bright, beau- 
tiful calendar girl. She wore the 
bottom half of a green striped 
bikini; the top half lay on the 
grass beside her. 

“My God! That’s Estelle, all 
right!” Chuck exclaimed. “I’d 
know her anywhere. Still got that 
terrific figure, too!” 

“I suppose she is hard to for- 
get after — how long? Just over 
seven years, isn’t it? Isn’t that 
how long you’ve been married?” 
“How did you know?” 

“Can’t you guess? Remember, 
seven or eight years ago, how 
you tortured yourself choosing 
between two girls — Estelle or 
Kathy? Remember how hard it 
was arriving at a decision?” 

“It wasn’t too difficult. I chose 
Kathy.” 

“I know,” Charles said, smil- 



ing. “I was left with Estelle. Or 
perhaps it was the other way 
round. Don’t you see: I am you 
and you are me! If there’s any 
difference between us, it’s only 
what the last seven years have 
done to us. It was one of those 
decisions I spoke of, when one 
of us followed one path, leaving 
the other to explore the other 
path.” 

“That’s crazy! I happen to 
know Estelle married a major in 
the Army years ago and went 
out West to live.” 

“In your world, maybe,” 
Charles said, “but the one in this 
world married me.” 

C HUCK looked enviously out 
of the window. “Lucky you.” 
He made a gesture that took in 
the room, the girl, the magnificent 
house, the beautiful garden. “Did 
Estelle make you rich, too?” 
“Not the way you seem to be 
figuring. Her father gave me a 
job in his electronics business 
and I did some profitable re- 
search for him. Now I’m a part- 
ner in the firm. We have a big 
plant on the other side of town. 
As a matter of fact, it was while 
I was in the lab out there that I 
stumbled on these alternate 
worlds. By sheer accident, I 
crossed into another world and 
almost scared myself to death. 

“By the way,” he went on, 
“what happened to you after you 



NOTHING BUT THE BEST 



59 



married Kathy? I often won- 
dered what it would have been 
like being married to her.” 

“It’s all right, I guess,” Chuck 
said. “We got married and bought 
a house. A couple of years ago, 
I went into business on my own 
— Hi-Fi and TV repairs. Business 
isn’t too bad.” He flashed another 
look at the golden girl sunning 
herself by the pool. “Estelle 
hasn’t changed much in all these 
years,” he said nostalgically. 
“She’s still as beautiful as ever.” 
Then he banged his glass down 
hard on the window sill. “You 
must be trying to put something 
over on me! What’s the gag?” 
“There’s no gag,” Charles as- 
sured him. “Besides, there’s more 
to come.” 

“Like what?” 

“I mentioned earlier about this 
being an infinite universe. There 
must be more than just the world 
you live in and the world I live 
in. Think it over — millions of 
everybody making decisions all 
the time, following one path and 
discarding another — there must 
be millions of worlds! An infinite 
number of them!” 

Chuck drained his glass and 
went back to the cabinet to help 
himself. 

“It’s not just a theory,” Charles 
insisted. “I know there’s more 
than just our two worlds. I’ve 
seen a couple of them. I could 
even take you to them. And 

60 



every time anyone makes a de- 
cision, new ones spring into ex- 
istence. Do you follow me?” 

“I guess so,” Chuck said. “As 
much as anyone can follow a 
thing like that.” 

“I’m still not finished — ” 
“Hold it,” Chuck cut in abrupt- 
ly. “Before we get tangled up 
any further, what am / doing 
here?” 

HAD to tell someone,” 
Charles said. “I couldn’t 
keep a thing like this to myself, 
yet who could I tell? I thought 
it over and said nothing to any- 
one in this world, because it sud- 
denly occurred to me that the 
best person to confide in was 
one of my hundreds of selves.” 
“Quit it,” Chuck begged. 
“Y ou’ll drive me nuts — you and 
your hundreds of selves!” 

“You’re one of them,” Charles 
reminded him. “The others all 
exist somewhere. I just happened 
to reach you by accident. When 
I started down Hobson’s Hill, I 
didn’t know which Charles Mead 
would be in the town. After all, 
I’ve made dozens of big decisions 
in the past few years. There must 
be plenty of other Charles Meads 
in existence.” 

“That still doesn’t explain why 
you brought me here. Don’t tell 
me you intend to round up all 
the different versions of yourself. 
If so, count me out!” 

OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You’re getting warm,” Charles 
said. “If you’ll bear with me a 
little longer, I’ll stretch your im- 
agination again.” 

Chuck groaned and settled 
down resignedly in the armchair. 

“If there really are all these 
worlds,” Charles began, “and I 
can’t see why there shouldn’t be, 
then a world must exist where 
there’s a Charles Mead who nev- 
er made a wrong decision! A 
Charles Mead who did every- 
thing right, who never made a 
wrong move in his life! Of course 
there must also be one of us who 
never made a right decision — to 
say nothing of all the endless va- 
rieties between the two extreme 
cases. But, of course, I’m not 
concerned with them.” 

Chuck stood watching the 
sleeping girl by the ornamental 
pool, looking back, thinking back 
over seven years. Then he went 
over to the cabinet and poured 
himself another drink — a strong 
one. “So what if there is a perfect 
Charles Mead somewhere? What 
about him?” 

“I’d like to see him,” Charles 
said. “I’d like to see such a 
world. Wouldn’t you?” 

“In your place? Not a chance! 
What’s wrong with the world 
you’re in now? It looks good to 
me. A lot better than mine — 
beautiful wife, big house, big shot 
in the company . .” 

“It’s a matter of what you’re 

NOTHING BUT THE BEST 



used to,” Charles said dryly. “I 
hope you don’t mind me saying 
this — we are brothers, more 
rather than less — when I called 
on you, I’m sure I heard you 
fighting with Kathy. Do you fight 
often?” 

“I guess we do,” Chuck said, 
“from time to time.” 

“Estelle and I fight all the 
time. I still regret marrying her, 
even though I got rich because 
of it. Anyway, we don’t, get along. 
We don’t even try to manage. 
There were plenty of times when 
I regretted not marrying Kathy. 
She seemed to me to be a nice 
homy, comfortable sort of kid.” 
“I hope you’re not going to 
suggest we trade places,” Chuck 
said. 

“Of course not. I told you — I’m 
searching for the perfect world. 
Charles Mead’s Utopia!” He 
raised his glass in a mock toast. 
“Want to come along?” 

i^HUCK MEAD was silent, 
^ looking out of the window 
on to the lawn. The girl by the 
pool stirred briefly in her sunny 
slumber. “Weren’t you ever happy 
with Estelle?” he asked. 

Charles shrugged. “I suppose I 
was at first. But we soon grew 
tired of each other. I was tied up 
with the business and Estelle 
wanted a good time.” 

“It’s funny,” Chuck said wist- 
fully, “but when Kathy and I 

61 



started to drift apart, I began to 
have Estelle on my mind all the 
time. I used to imagine how much 
better things would have been if 
I’d married her instead.” 

“I guess we both made a poor 
choice. Probably the perfect 
Charles Mead didn’t choose ei- 
ther girl.” 

“If I failed with Kathy and 
you failed with Estelle, I wouldn’t 
be surprised if the Charles Mead 
who — ah — got away didn’t fail in 
some other world. Kathy and Es- 
telle were a couple of nice kids. 
Maybe it wasn’t their fault en- 
tirely. Maybe it was the fault of 
Charles and Chuck Mead.” 
“Possibly,” said Charles a little 
wearily. “But that sort of argu- 
ment gets us nowhere. You still 
can’t disprove that there isn’t a 
perfect Charles Mead some- 
where.” 

“I doubt if he’s perfect,” Chuck 
said. “Making the correct deci- 
sions all the time doesn’t neces- 
sarily make him perfect. Besides, 
even if you did meet him, it 
wouldn’t alter you in any way. 
You’d be the same person you 
are now.” 

“I’d still like to find him.” 

“I’ll bet you wouldn’t know 
him if you saw him. And you 
might waste a whole lifetime 
looking. Then, if you did find 
him, what makes you think he’d 
want you hanging around?” 

“At least, if he did kick me 



out, I’d know he’d made the ab- 
solutely correct decision,” Charles 
said, smiling. 

“Well, don’t count me in on 
your search. If you take my ad- 
vice, you’ll smash your invention 
or whatever it is and stay in 
your own world. There’s nothing 
to be gained by exploring the 
paths you might have followed.” 

“What’s to be gained by not 
going?” 

“That’s up to you. You can 
stay and make the best of your 
own world.” 

“You’re a fine one to talk. Are 
you going back to your own life 
— to Kathy? Even though you 
don’t get along with her?” 

TVTODDING emphatically, 

’ Chuck said, “Of course. 
Your Utopia is as remote to me 
as Heaven or Hell. The impor- 
tant thing is not the hundreds of 
lives you could have led or all 
the possibilities that occur in 
your lifetime. The thing that 
counts is what you do with the 
one lifetime that’s given to you. 
You’re not happy with Estelle 
so you blame Estelle, thinking 
you’d be happier with Kathy or 
someone else. I felt the same way 
about Kathy and thought I’d be 
happier with Estelle. Now that 
you’ve given us both the oppor- 
tunity to see ourselves ruining 
both lives, we can see that it’s 
probably us at fault. If you want 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to find the perfect Charles Mead, 
you have to find him inside your- 
self — not in some untouchable 
otherworld.” 

“You should have been a min- 
ister,” Charles told him. “You 
preach a good sermon.” 

Chuck’s boyish face reddened 
suddenly. “It still goes, anyway. 
Perhaps I’ve spent more time 
than you lately wondering why 
my marriage was breaking up. 
Maybe I have the answer now.” 
“So you’re going back to the 
little woman, filled with love and 
kisses and a heart full of hope!” 
“Forget it,” Chuck said. “For- 
get I said anything at all.” 

“Don’t worry about it. No hard 
feelings. You’re perfectly free to 
do or say what you like.” He sud- 
denly smiled and then began to 
laugh aloud. 

“What’s funny?” Chuck asked. 
“Plenty,” said Charles. “I just 
realized we both made decisions 
a few minutes ago. We both chose 
between two alternatives. You 
decided to go home to Kathy 
instead of going with me. I de- 
cided to go on with my quest in- 
stead of going back to Estelle.” 
“What about it?” 

“Remember what I told you? 
Every time you choose one of 
two alternative courses of action, 
another world comes into exis- 
tence in which you follow the 
other course of action ! Don’t you 
see what that means?” 

NOTHING BUT THE. BEST 



C HARLES MEAD said good- 
by to Chuck as they stood 
on top of Hobson’s Hill. Then, 
when Chuck had vanished, he 
switched off his equipment and 
set about camouflaging the black 
boxes in the bushes. It was too 
late in the day to make a second 
attempt at crossing into another 
world and he decided to wait un- 
til tomorrow. When a man was 
seeking perfection, he told him- 
self, it paid to be patient and 
cautious and not to rush head- 
long into things. 

Presently, when he was satis- 
fied with his work of concealing 
the apparatus, he set off down 
the hill. 

❖ .*>: 

Chuck Mead came through the 
harrowing experience of crossing 
worlds and stood once more on 
the top of Hobson’s Hill in his 
own world. He glanced all around 
him, nervously reassuring him- 
self that he was in his own world 
again. Then he took a crumpled 
cigarette from his shirt pocket 
and inhaled hungrily while he 
waited for his heart to stop its 
frantic hammering. 

Had he really been in another 
world, he wondered, and had he 
really seen Estelle? Presently, as 
he recalled events, his train of 
thought brought him around to 
Kathy and his decision. She 
would still be mad at him after 
the fight they had had when 

63 



Charles arrived. Funny, now he 
couldn’t even remember what 
they had been quarreling about! 
It seemed that any little thing 
could start them off these days. 

But it wasn’t too late — he was 
sure of that now. The situation 
could still be repaired. There 
was still time. 

With a quick, determined ges- 
ture, he flung the cigarette away 
from him, and with a new spring 
in his stride, he set off down the 
hill. 

S OMEWHERE in the infinite 
universe, among the myriad 
worlds and possibilities, was a 
world born of a decision. In 
this world, Charles Mead stood 
on top of Hobson’s Hill disman- 
tling his apparatus. He was fin- 
ished with it and was going to 
destroy it as soon as he got home. 
Chuck had been right; he was a 
fool to think of leaving Estelle 
for a mad dream. 

Strange, he thought, the way 
he had neglected her all these 
years. A girl like Estelle needed 
warmth and gayety and affec- 
tion, not the boorish neglect of 
an idiot who wished he was in 
another world. He was lucky, he 
realized, that she was still there 
to go home to. 

With the act of making his de- 
cision, he felt a new peace of 
mind he had not experienced in 
years. At least he was about to 

64 



tackle a problem within his 
grasp, not some ridiculous and 
impossible hunt through an in- 
finity of alien worlds. 

He shook his head, genuinely 
puzzled. How on Earth could he 
have ever considered such an ab- 
surd notion, he wondered as he 
shouldered his equipment and 
set off down the hill. 

TN YET another world, also 
born of a decision, Charles 
and Chuck Mead emerged on 
top of Hobson’s Hill. They looked 
about them eagerly, pointing out 
the landmarks in the town below. 

“This one’s really different!” 
Charles said excitedly. “Look, 
there’s no lumberyard and not 
even any railroad tracks. And 
that tall gray building downtown 
is new, too!” 

“Let’s go,” Chuck urged. “Let’s 
take a look.” 

“Take it easy,” Charles cau- 
tioned, his hand on Chuck’s arm. 
“We’ll have to be careful about 
this. Remember, we’re looking 
for the best — the perfect — 
world!” 

“Okay,” Chuck said. “Even if 
it takes a lifetime, we settle for 
nothing but the best.” 

And together, like two wise 
men off to seek Truth itself and, 
at the same time, like two school- 
boys on some youthful adven- 
ture, they set off down the hill.

PROJECT VANGUARD 

A GAIN this is a column 
which is written entirely 
in response to letters re- 
ceived from readers— a fairly high 
percentage of the mail during the 
last few months has been asking 
about Project Vanguard, the offi- 
cial name for the satellite shots. 
Why, several correspondents 
wanted to know, why has Galaxy, 
of all magazines, been so silent on 
Vanguard? 

Well, there are several inter- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



65 





twined answers to this query. To 
begin with, I explained various 
possible methods of shooting a 
satellite, in Galaxy, just a short 
time prior to the official announce- 
ment that the United States 
would shoot a satellite during the 
International Geophysical Year of 
1957-58. When the announcement 
was made — the date was July 29, 
1955 — there was nothing new 
that could be added for a consider- 
able while. 

Some of the letters I received 
reminded me of a press confer- 
ence I attended, where a newspa- 
perman said to a government sci- 
entist involved in Vanguard: 
“You boys have changed your 
story around several times; why 
don’t you stick to one line?” 
Whereupon the scientist answered 
truthfully that nobody had 
changed a story around, but that 
the facts were released as the sci- 
entists made up their minds what 
to do. 

Incidentally I still don’t know 
just what that newspaperman 
meant when he accused the scien- 
tists, or the public relations offi- 
cers, of having “changed the story 
around.” Each release merely 
added more facts. He must have 
considered it a case of malicious 
duplicity that the first release 
spoke about a satellite, while later 
releases upped the figure to ten. 
Now the figure has been raised to 
twelve and sixteen units are on 

66 



order, presumably to allow for 
possible failures. 

EFORE telling what has been 
decided upon, it might be 
wise to mention the fundamental 
facts briefly. A body will become 
a satellite of Earth if it has a 
certain and rather high velocity, 
parallel to the ground, outside the 
atmosphere. Which velocity is re- 
quired depends on the distance 
from the ground, but for those 
heights now within reach, say 
from 200 to 800 miles, the re- 
quired velocities are all quite 
close to 4 Vi miles per second. 
Let’s assume the body needs 
16,000 miles per hour to stay in 
its orbit. To impart such a veloc- 
ity on something with the use of 
present-day fuels requires a three- 
stage rocket. 

The problem of producing a 
permanent satellite may therefore 
be described as consisting of two 
successive steps. The first one 
would be to lift the artificial satel- 
lite beyond the atmosphere, about 
to a height of 200 miles. The sec- 
ond would be to provide it with 
velocity parallel to the ground. 

In reality, these two steps are 
not so strictly separated. The lift- 
ing itself could and would provide 
some of the velocity needed. 

If every one of the three rock- 
ets which make up the three- 
stage rocket were to fire just as 
soon as the preceding stage has 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



used up its fuel, it could easily 
happen that the burn-out point of 
the third stage is still in the at- 
mosphere. Now the orbit begins 
at the bum-out point of the final 
stage of the assembly. This means 
that the artificial satellite, each 
time it has completed one revolu- 
tion around the Earth, would go 
through that bum-out point. 

Since the Earth has meanwhile 
turned on its axis, that point 
would be somewhere else with 
reference to the ground. 

But this is another problem. 
The important fact here is that 
the satellite would have to go 
through the altitude of the burn- 
out point of the final, third stage. 
If that bum-out point were at a 
height of 80 miles, the satellite, 
each time it comes around, would 
dip into the atmosphere to an 
Earth-nearest point, the perigee, 
only 80 miles up. Each time it 
does that, air resistance would kill 
off some of its momentum. Hence 
it would not be a permanent satel- 
lite, but a temporary one. 

A few satellite shots will cer- 
tainly be made with the perigee 
of the orbit inside the atmosphere, 
just because measuring the 
changes in the orbit which occur 
as a result of the grazing of the 
atmosphere would giv6 us figures 
for atmospheric density at such 
great heights. 

But if you want a permanent 
satellite, a burn-out point in the 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



atmosphere will not do. You want 
the final burn-out point to. be lo- 
cated outside the atmosphere. 
And this can be done by taking 
advantage of the well-known fact 
that a rocket does not stop mov- 
ing just because its fuel supply 
has been used up. 

After the period of “powered 
flight,” there comes the period of 
“unpowered flight” for every roc- 
ket. And if, at the moment of 
burn-out, the trajectory pointed 
upward, as is usually the case, the 
gain in altitude after bum-out is 
considerable. In the nearly verti- 
cal high-altitude shots of the V-2 
program, the bum-out altitude of 
the rocket was always quite close 
to 20 miles. The peak altitudes 
reached were from 85 to 114 
miles. 

The three-stage Vanguard satel- 
lite carrier will lift vertically at 
first. After it has gained an alti- 
tude of two or three miles, it will 
be tilted in an easterly direction. 
This tilt eastward will take ad- 
vantage of the fact that the Earth 
turns in an easterly direction, so 
that the rocket receives a kind of 
free velocity gift. 

The firing site for Vanguard is 
going to be Patrick Air Force 
Base, near Cape Canaveral in Flor- 
ida. The rotational velocity of 
the Air Force Base being around 
1300 feet per second, the rocket 
gains this 1300 feet per second 
by moving eastward after takeoff. 

67 




The official schematic drawing of the satellite shots. The term "range 
1500 miles" on the diagram refers to the expected impact point of the 
second stage, about 1500 miles from the takeoff site. 



(If one insisted that it should 
move westward, it would need ex- 
tra fuel to kill off these 1300 feet 
per second, obviously an illogical 
procedure.) 

When the first stage stops burn- 
ing, the whole will be about 36 
miles above sea level and, meas- 
ured horizontally, about 25 miles 
to the east of the firing site. At 
this moment, the second stage ig- 
nites and lifts itself out of the first 
stage. The first stage will go 
through a normal ballistic trajec- 
tory, which will carry it to a maxi- 
mum height of roughly 65 miles 
above sea level. This highest point 

6 < 



of its trajectory will be about 120 
miles from the takeoff site, meas- 
ured horizontally. The first stage 
will find its end by smashing into 
the Atlantic Ocean 230 miles 
from the takeoff site. 

Meanwhile, the second stage 
has used up its fuel and acquired 
a velocity that is roughly half of 
the necessary orbital velocity. At 
the moment of burn-out, it will be 
140 miles above sea level and at 
least that far from the firing site, 
measured horizontally. Now it 
coasts upward at a very shallow 
angle. It may to all intents and 
purposes be beyond the atmos- 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




phere at 140 miles altitude, but it 
is safe to make sure. 

The second stage will be per- 
mitted to coast without power to 
an altitude beyond 200 miles. In 
fact, it will probably reach around 
300 miles. While gaining altitude 
as it coasts along, it unfortunately 
loses velocity. The loss due to 
whatever air resistance there 
might still be left will probably 
be so small that it could not even 
be measured, but the rocket is 
coasting upward against the gra- 
vitational attraction of the Earth. 
And that is a loss that can be 
calculated and is noticeable. 

When the second stage has 
coasted to the highest altitude it 
can attain, it must of necessity be 
moving parallel to the ground. It 
is now at the halfway point of its 
trajectory. From now on, it will 
lose altitude and gain speed 
again, following the gravitational 
attraction of the Earth. At the 
point where it is highest, moving 
parallel to the ground — and inci- 
dentally moving at its slowest, 
which is still pretty fast — the 
third-stage rocket will separate 
from the second stage. 

The horizontal distance from 
the launching site at that moment 
is 700 miles. The height is right. 
The direction of movement is 
right, too. All that is still lacking 
is velocity. It is up to the third 
stage to make up the difference 
between what it has and what is 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



required. Nobody can tell pre- 
cisely at the moment just how 
much that will be, but the third 
stage will probably have to sup- 
ply half of the total velocity. 

A PERIGEE of 300 miles is 
either outside the atmosphere 
or still inside, depending on whose 
figures you are willing to accept. 
If we take the highest figures 
available, a satellite with a peri- 
gee 300 miles up will last a year. 
Taking the lowest figures, it will 
be permanent, at least as com- 
pared to the human life-span. Its 
actual lifetime will probably be 
somewhat in between — after all, 
this is one of the things we want 
to find out. 

So much for the performance 
of the satellite carrier. Now for its 
appearance and dimensions. 

The overall appearance of the 
Vanguard three-stage rocket will 
be precisely that of an enormous 
rifle cartridge — no fins. Fins are 
not needed because the rocket 
motors of the first two stages will 
be mounted on gymbals, just as 
were the motors of the Viking 
rockets. Balancing during the first 
few seconds following takeoff and 
tilting thereafter will be accom- 
plished by deflecting the exhaust 
blast slightly, as needed. 

At takeoff, the satellite carrier 
will be 72 feet tall, with a largest 
diameter of 45 inches. It will be 
an exceptionally long and slim 

69 



rocket. The total takeoff weight 
will be around eleven tons, which 
is less than the takeoff weight of 
the V-2. The first stage will be 
guided and controlled, but the 
guidance and control instruments 
will all be located in the second 
stage. One may say that the first 
stage is essentially a booster of 
large dimensions, the device to 
supply the first heavy push. The 
fine work is all done by the sec- 
ond stage. 

The second stage operates on 
other fuels than the first, the main 
reason being that the liquid oxy- 
gen used in the first stage is not 
really storable. Once you have 
fueled a rocket operating on liquid 
oxygen, it is time to fire it. There- 
fore the two upper stages of Van- 
guard must have storable fuels. 
That of the second stage is un- 
symmetrical dimethyl-hydrazine, 
burning with nitric acid which 
acts as the oxidizer. The fuel of 
the third stage will be a solid fuel, 
precise composition not yet de- 
cided on. 

As has been mentioned, it is the 
second stage which does all the 
fine work. It controls the first 
stage and later it controls itself. 
And because it puts itself in the 
proper position and fires the third 
stage at the proper moment, it 
may be said to control the third 
stage, too. Technically, the third 
stage is an unguided rocket, just 
something that is aimed (by the 

70 



second stage) and fired at the 
right moment. 

HP HE third stage and the artifi- 
cial satellite on top of the 
third stage will be completely en- 
cased by the nose cone of the sec- 
ond stage. After second-stage 
burn-out, this nose cone will split 
open and be shed, exposing the 
third stage and the satellite. They 
had to be protected against air 
friction on the way up, but after 
reaching 140 miles, they do not 
need protection any more. The 
third stage is supposed to spin 
around its longitudinal axis for 
stability. This spin must be in- 
duced by a mechanism in the sec- 
ond stage and it might be this 
spin which is used to get rid of 
the protecting nose cone of the 
second stage. 

Nothing much is yet known 
about the third stage, except for 
the fact that it will be a solid-fuel 
rocket to simplify firing proce- 
dure. Nor can much be said about 
the satellite itself, except that 
there will be various satellites. 
The one most talked about will 
be spherical, of the same diameter 
as the third-stage rocket — ex- 
pected to be 20 inches — and con- 
tain instruments which report 
their findings to the ground by 
means of a battery-powered radio 
transmitter. It might be necessary 
to separate this satellite from the 
third-stage rocket. This could be 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



done most simply by mounting it 
on a tensed spring which is re- 
leased by a timing device. 

If such separation of satellite 
and third-stage carrier is neces- 
sary and is carried out, we’ll get 
two satellites for the price of one. 
The third-stage rocket is in the 
same orbit as the satellite. It is 
only a few feet per second slower 
than the satellite (which got a 
slight additional push from the 
tensed spring) and it has no rea- 
son to fall back to Earth. 

Satellite and third-stage rocket 
will move along the same orbit, 
drawing apart very slowly, and 
will afford a fine comparison of 
the behavior of two satellites in 
the same orbit, but of different 
shapes. The latter only matters, 
of course, as far as residual air re- 
sistance is concerned. 

If no separation is needed, the 
satellite proper would simply be 
the nose cone of the third-stage 
rocket. It is quite possible that a 
specialized satellite would be es- 
sentially attached to the third 
stage, with a few sensing elements 
sticking out from it. 

Still another possible form of 
artificial satellite that has been 
discussed in the past would be un- 
instrumented and large. One 
could fill up the whole nose cone 
of the third stage with a com- 
pressed plastic foam that is per- 
mitted to escape to form a large 
foam bubble around the third 



stage. Or it could be a non-elastic 
plastic balloon which is inflated 
from a pressure capsule carried 
along. 

This latter type of artificial 
satellite would have a very fine 
visibility. It would not report to 
the ground by means of radio, but 
it would reveal very many things 
we want to know because of the 
shape of the orbit it will assume. 
And in order to observe this well, 
the satellite must be easily visible. 

I may add that it is planned to 
inform the public via the newspa- 
pers and radio when the artificial 
satellites will be visible for a cer- 
tain area. They will be naked-eye 
objects, faint stars that can be 
told from the real stars because of 
their visible movement. But, of 
course, these faint moving stars 
will only be the vanguard of much 
bigger ones to come. 

THE YEAR ON MARS 

T N the January issue this year, 
■*- I answered a question from a 
reader concerning a calendar for 
Mars. Not only the reader whose 
question I answered — or thought 
I did — but half a dozen others 
have written in in the meantime, 
telling me that I had not been ex- 
plicit enough. A few of them had 
tried to construct Martian calen- 
dars on the basis of my reply, but 
found they did not have enough 
information to go by. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



71 



Since Mars is near right now, 
interest in the construction of a 
calendar for Mars for the conven- 
ience of future explorers might be 
more widespread than at other 
times and I’ll therefore go into 
the subject at greater length and 
with more detail. The two nat- 
ural units on which any calendar 
is based are the length of the day, 
which is the time needed by the 
planet to turn around its axis, and 
the length of the year, the time 
needed by the same planet to 
move once around the Sun. 

Mars needs 687 days to go 
around the Sun once, but these 
are Earth days. The Martian day 
is 37 minutes and about 23 sec- 
onds longer than the Earth day; 
hence there are 668.59905 Mars 
days in a Martian year. For the 
sake of convenience, let’s round 
this off to 668 6/ 10th days; we 
can take care of the tiny differ- 
ence later. Using that figure, we 
find that five Mars years contain 
3343 Martian days. Since for 
purposes of calendar making, 
every year has to have a number 
of full days — you cannot end a 
year with half a day and three- 
tenths of a day — the five years 
comprising such a five-year cycle 
must be of unequal length. 

Breaking up the five-year cycle 
is naturally an arbitrary proce- 
dure which could follow any one 
of several different schemes. 
Three possibilities are these: 

72 





First Year 


669 days

Third Year

Fourth Year

669 


u 




Third Year 


668 


a 




Fourth Year 


669 


u 




Fifth Year 


669 “ 

3343 days 



In short, you can either have four 
years of equal length, with the 
fifth year two days shorter or 
three days longer than the others; 
or else you can alternate with 
each fifth year one day longer 
than it would come out if alterna- 
tion were carried through. 

A NOTHER and in some of 
spects better way would be 
to follow a ten-year cycle with 
alternating years. During such a 
ten-year cycle of 6686 Martian 
days, the five “short” years of 668 
days each would have accumu- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



lated 3340 days and the five 
“long” years of 669 days each 
would have accumulated 3345 
days, totaling 6685 days. This is 
one day short, so every tenth year 
would have to have one addi- 
tional leap year’s day to make the 
cycle come out even. 

So far, so good, but how do we 



divide the years into months? 

Using the ten-year cycle, Dr. 
Robert G. Aitken, former director 
of the Lick Observatory, devised 
a calendar in which each year had 
sixteen months of six weeks each. 

In an odd-numbered year, the 
four months of spring would all 
begin on a Sunday and the first

Scheme for a 


Martia 


n calendar for a 


"short" year 


as 


devised by 



Dr. Robert G. Aitken 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



73 



three of these four months would 
have 42 days each, but the fourth 
spring month only 41 days. Con- 
sequently the four summer months 
would all begin with a Saturday; 
the first three of them would have 
42 days each and the fourth sum- 
mer month again only 41 days. 
Therefore the four autumn 
months would all begin on Fri- 
days, again with the fourth month 
having only 41 days, so that the 
four winter months would all be- 
gin on Thursdays. Since again the 
fourth winter month is only 41 
days long, the whole year has 
used up 668 days. 

The next year, logically, has to 
be an even-numbered year begin- 
ning on a Wednesday. Again the 
four spring months all start on 
the same weekday, and since the 
fourth spring month is 41 days 
long, the four summer months all 
begin on Tuesdays, running 
through the schedule of 42, 42, 42 
and 41 days. This makes the four 
autumn months begin on Mon- 
days and the four winter months 
on Sundays. But in an even-num- 
bered year, all four winter months 
are 42 days long, so that the next 
odd-numbered year also begins on 
a Sunday, as did the preceding 
odd-numbered year. 

This scheme can run with ut- 
most rigidity for nine years, but 
the tenth year must have an extra 
day to complete the cycle. This 
extra day will be outside the 

74 



scheme and not be assigned to 
any week or month. It will be, in 
name as well as in spirit, a Holi- 
day. 

The more recent calendar for 
Mars, devised by Dr. I. M. Levitt, 
director of the Fels Planetarium 
in Philadelphia, is based on a five- 
year cycle with a sequence of 668, 
669, 669, 668, 669 days. It has 
twelve months, like the terrestrial 
calendar, but with eight weeks to 
the month. A “short” year of 668 
days would look as shown in 
Table II. 

As can be seen, at the end of 
each season there would have to 
be one “short week” of only six 
days. The absence of one day per 
season would have to be disre- 
garded in assigning weekday 
names. By doing that, every week 
throughout the whole year (and 
of course every month, too) 
would begin with a Sunday. In 
the “long” years, the month of 
December would have 56 days, so 
that a “long” year would have 
only three “short” weeks instead 
of four. 

This takes care of everything 
except the small difference caused 
by rounding off the Martian year 
to 668.6 Martian days. That sim- 
plification causes every calendar 
year in both these calendars to be 
0.00095 days too long, which 
builds up to very nearly a full day 
in a thousand years. The adjust- 
ment would consist in making

Scheme for 


a Martian calendar for 1 


. "short" 


year according 


to 





Dr. I. M. Levitt 



what would normally be a “long” 
year into a “short” year every 
millennium. 

Dropping one day every mil- 
lennium is certainly an easy, 
uncomplicated method of adjust- 
ment, but the fact is that this ad- 
justs the calendar a bit too much. 
After a mere twenty thousand 
years, the error will have added 
up to a full day, so the adjust- 
ment consisting of changing a 
“long” year into a “short” year 
must be omitted every twentieth 
millennium. 

Well, this ought to be detailed 
enough for the making of a Mar- 



tian calendar. The difference be- 
tween terrestrial and Martian 
day, by the way, is within the 
adjustment spread of a better- 
class watch or alarm clock. If you 
want to, you can have a “Martian 
clock” just by adjusting one to be 
37 minutes and 23 seconds “late” 
according to Earth time. Once 
you have accomplished this, and 
don’t forget to keep it wound, the 
time shown by the hands will 
make no sense whatever after 
only a week. However, it will be 
correct Martian time, for some 
place on Mars.

* Some problem to give an unsuccessful poet

And for the twentieth time since 
he had received the letter in that

Foremost, because it was trig- 
gered like a reflex, was pain. It

goggles which had been locked on 
him and which reversed his vision. 
And that ultraviolet room where— 

He brought himself up with a 
start, conscious that a man in the 
seat opposite was looking at him 
curiously. Humphrey stared the 
fellow down. After all, who 
wouldn’t show his emotions at the 
memory of that experience? He’d 
had double vision for weeks after- 
ward and even now had a tend- 
ency to walk in circles if he didn’t 
watch out. 

And all for what? he had asked 
himself when he got their letter of 
rejection. They had said they 
would keep his application on file. 
He’d taken that for what it was 
usually worth. But now — well, 
one thing was sure. If they thought 
he was going to let himself be put 
through all that again, they had 
another think coming. There were 
limits to what a self-respecting 
human being would put up with 
in his efforts to reach other 
worlds. 

Ah, but that was it! 



F OR that was another of the 
emotions that the letter fanned 
to ignition point — his desperation 
to get out. But not for the usual 
reasons. Most of them wanted — 
what? — profit, adventure, escape, 
he supposed. 

He smiled now at the memory 
of Crump asking him what his 
reasons were. He’d said the 
money. Useless to have stated the 
real one — images. Crump would 
have thought him mad. 

But that was the sober truth of 
it. Being a poet in the 22nd cen- 
tury had its special problems. 
Not the age-old one of scanty re- 
ward — he got by, anyway, nosing 
out old and rare books — but the 
sheer brute fact that there had 
been so many poets already that 
there was precious little left to 
say. 

Oh, new ideas, new gadgets 
came out daily, but it took years 
for them to be assimilated to the 
point where a poet could intro- 
duce them naturally into his 
work. Humphrey still smarted 
from the mauling one of his pieces 
had received from a hostile critic 
because he’d described his rela- 
tions with a girl friend in terms of 
operating a cyberscope. For that 
matter, he’d suffered a pretty se- 
vere mauling from the girl friend, 
too, before she’d turned on one 
prismatic heel and marched out 
of his life. 

That had been the clinching 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



point. There was only one thing 
to do — get out where the new ho- 
rizons were being unrolled, where 
new experiences and new colors 
would quicken his jaded soul. It 
had to be a job; the tourist trade 
was strictly for millionaires. But 
months of trying had got him no- 
where — until this morning. 

He savored that 10:00 hours 
T.M.T.— Terran Mean Time. The 
soberly printed symbols woke vi- 
sions of men who used such 
phrases as casually as he’d say “ a 
quarter after three,” of the worlds 
in which they moved. He felt a 
tingling in his blood, felt the 
images crowding all ready to be 
liberated. 

A MODISHLY moss-cut blonde 
showed him into Crump’s 
presence. But his attention was 
jerked to somebody else, distrib- 
uted awkwardly over a chair by 
Crump’s desk — a tall, bony indi- 
vidual with thick old-fashioned 
glasses. 

Suppressing a shudder, Hum- 
phrey marched straight up to 
Crump’s desk. “Let’s get one thing 
straight before we start — I’m hav- 
ing nothing to do with him.” 

“Ah, yes,” said the plump little 
executive, gesturing Humphrey to 
a chair. “You remember Dr. Clap- 
perton?” 

“Could I forget?” Humphrey 
all but snarled. 

“Well,” said Crump reassur- 



ingly, “Dr. Clapperton is only here 
this time on — ah — a watching 
brief. Now you’re ready to start 
immediately?” 

“Just give me twelve hours to 
settle things up,” said Humphrey, 
relieved. “This is an extraterres- 
trial job, of course, like the last 
one I lost out on?” 

Crump seemed to hesitate 
slightly. “This is the same job you 
applied for.” 

“Oh? But those tests last time. 
I thought—” 

“Figures,” Crump said con- 
temptuously. He picked up a 
folder and consulted it. “You had 
an A.Q. of 35.5, the lowest of the 
fifteen applicants we tested.” 

Humphrey looked puzzled. 

“We’ve already tried two men,” 
Crump went on. “One with an 
A.Q. of 98.5, another with 97.” 
Seeing that Humphrey still looked 
bewildered, he added, with a 
passing glare at Clapperton, “Af- 
ter a week, both of them were 
signaling home to be relieved.” 

“I see,” said Humphrey, which 
wasn’t quite true. “Adaptability 
isn’t the important thing for this 
job, then?” 

Crump sighed painfully. “I don’t 
know. What I do know is that 
Clapperton here wheedled an al- 
location of a hundred thousand 
credits out of me for all that A.Q. 
testing paraphernalia. He is here 
now to witness what I think of his 
system.”

“I still say I’m right,” Clapper- 
ton protested. “An organism in a 
strange environment either has to 
adapt, get out or — ” 

“Go under,” Crump finished for 
him in a weary tone. “I know it 
by heart by now.” 

“Well, it’s true.” 

“Then your system of assess- 
ment must be haywire, because it 
hasn’t worked'for Verna.” 

“Just what is wrong with — er 
— Verna?” Humphrey put in. 

“Right,” said Crump. “Briefly, 
the natives’ disinterest in selling 
us certain skins that we’d like to 
buy.” 

“You mean you can’t offer 
enough?” 

“I mean that we have yet to 
find what the Vemans will take 
in payment.” 

“Money, perhaps?” Humphrey 
suggested brightly. 

C RUMP gave him a sad look. 

“We did think of that. But it’s 
no use to them. They don’t ap- 
preciate metals, gems, trade bal- 
ances. Verna is way out and right 
off the usual routes. There’s no 
terran settlement or tourist trade, 
so it’s understandable that our 
money isn’t of much interest to 
them. But they don’t seem to 
want anything else that we can 
offer, either. At least” — he looked 
at Humphrey peculiarly — “so far 
as we’ve been able to find out.” 
“But how’s that? I’d like to be 

80 



a bit clearer on conditions there, 
if you don’t mind.” 

“It is a precept of Dr. Clapper- 

ton, ” Crump answered, “to leave 
the subject with an entirely open 
mind. That’s one idea of his that 
I do go along with. The two men 
he selected started from scratch, 

too. ” 

Humphrey felt suddenly an- 
noyed. “If that’s the only reason, 
I think you—” 

“Ah, but that isn’t the only rea- 
son. Clapperton’s idea seems fair 
enough. You will adapt better if 
the environment is completely 
new. To tell you more might lead 
you to preconceive lines of adap- 
tation that wouldn’t work in prac- 
tice. It might be harder to scrap 
them than to start clear.” 

Humphrey nodded, reluctantly 
seeing the logic of that. 

“The pay will be a thousand a 
month,” Crump said, “plus ex- 
penses, plus a lump sum of fifty 
thousand if you can land a con- 
tract with the Vernans, with fif- 
teen per cent commission on the 
Earth selling price of all grath 
skins you ship.” 

Grath skins, thought Humphrey, 
must be horribly hard to get. He 
was about to agree when it oc- 
curred to him that he could dem- 
onstrate his powers of adaptation 
right here and now. 

“I want seventy-five thousand 
and twenty per cent.” 

“Done,” said Crump, with sus- 

GALAXY SCIFNCE FICTION 



picious alacrity. ‘Til have the con- 
tract drawn up right away.” 

A FTER a couple of days in in- 
tertransit, Humphrey’s some- 
what romantic view of the men 
who plied the stellar distances 
had suffered a space-change. The 
crew of the freighter that was car- 
rying him to Verna were the most 
taciturn bunch he’d ever met. His 
pleasantly phrased questions 
about their jobs got terse grunts. 

It was because their jobs were 
all routine, the captain answered 
Humphrey’s plaint at dinner, a 
matter of constantly checking the 
automatic gear that really ran the 
ship. They were the type the ship- 
ping companies chose, the self-suf- 
ficient kind who suffered boredom 
best. 

That brief speech seemed to 
strain the captain’s verbal pow- 
ers severely. Captains were evi- 
dently chosen on the same prin- 
ciple. 

After that, Humphrey kept to 
his cabin most of the time, read- 
ing from cover to cover and back 
again the two anthologies that a 
stringent baggage allowance had 
limited him to. The pack that 
CDI had supplied had taken up 
nearly all the allowance. 

The pack consisted of a bulky 
illustrated catalogue of Earth 
goods, a six-month ration of food 
capsules and a squat black Fritsch 
Field transmitter. A brochure 



came with that. It seemed that 
Smith III, the nearest terran sta- 
tion to Verna, would direct an in- 
terbeam his way once a week, 
which was about as often as the 
black box would be able to get up 
enough power to generate a ten- 
minute interference signal. 

He had been told to cram up 
on Intercode. At the end of mes- 
sage, the operator on Smith III 
would acknowledge receipt by 
collapsing the beam, which would, 
in the stiff language of the bro- 
chure, “register with an audible 
oscillation.” 

Humphrey had been somewhat 
taken aback at finding that com- 
munication would be that rudi- 
mentary. Knowing, as everybody 
did, that intertransit covered light- 
years in days, he had assumed 
that the mere exchange of mes- 
sages would be easy and certainly 
telephonic. And two-way, at least. 
It was, he was told, between es- 
tablished stations, but that took 
considerably more tonnage of 
equipment and power than he 
could man or manage. 

He had accepted that in a good 
pioneering spirit — even if it did 
mean that a call for help would 
have to await the next weekly 
beam. But he still brooded on 
Crump’s refusal to tell him more 
about Verna. He hated not know- 
ing what he might have to call for 
help from. 

But he finished the flight in 



VERBAL AGREEMENT 



81 



good heart, sustained by the con- 
viction that he was getting some- 
where at last. 

T HE ship materialized out of 
interspace and dropped him 
on Verna, the single planet of a 
Sol-type sun. The captain wished 
him a laconic good luck. The crew 
looked up a moment from their 
tasks. 

The freighter took off again. 
Humphrey was alone on a strange 
planet for the first time in his life. 

He looked about him. He was 
standing in a sun-baked stretch of 
country. Trees were dotted about 
the place. Over to his left and be- 
yond a rise of yellow ground, he 
could see the tops of the white 
buildings that he had glimpsed 
through the clouds as the ship 
had descended. 

Everything was peaceful, the 
day pleasantly warm. The trees, 
the sky, the smell of the air even, 
were comfortingly Earthlike. No- 
body — no thing — seemed to have 
started out to meet him. 

He shrugged, hoisted the pack 
which, under what seemed slightly 
less than Earth gravity, was still 
heavy enough, and set off toward 
the signs of life. 

As he surmounted the rise, he 
came into full view of what he 
saw now was a sizable city. The 
buildings were no primitive lean- 
tos, either; some of them were 
several stories high. But there 

82 



was still no sign of any commit- 
tee, welcoming or otherwise. 

Only as he was almost under 
the shadow of the outer ring of 
buildings did he get his first sight 
of a Vernan — and then of eight or 
nine at once. And very small ones. 
They came out, scampering, to- 
ward him, laughing shrilly. 

One of Humphrey’s fears van- 
ished. At least he wouldn’t have 
to adapt to the idea of talking 
business with a fire-breathing dra- 
gon. These kids were just like 
kids anywhere, even if their hair 
was a bright saffron in color. He 
waved to them cheerfully. 

But just then an adult Vernan, 
a woman, came out and shouted 
at them. The children stopped, 
hesitated, then trooped reluctantly 
back. 

It wasn’t until the city had 
swallowed them up again that 
Humphrey realized something. 
The woman hadn’t shouted at all. 
That could mean only one thing 
— the Vernans were .telepathic. 
Well, that ought to take care of 
the language problem. 

He entered the city, his confi- 
dence boosted. 

TNSIDE the close outer ring of 
houses, the place opened up 
into broad thoroughfares. He saw 
lots of Vernans now. They all had 
that saffron hair. They were 
dressed in short pastel-colored to- 
gas that showed a good deal of 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tawny skin and some handsome 
physiques. 

But nobody seemed to be tak- 
ing any notice of him, except in 
the negative sense that not one of 
them came near him. As he passed 
up the middle of a wide avenue, 
the native population retreated or 
skirted what would have been the 
sidewalks, if not for the fact that 
they didn’t have sidewalks here. 
This tied in with the realization 
that he couldn’t see any sign of 
mechanical transport. Or hear 
any. The whole place was eerily 
silent. Then he realized that that 
would be only natural in a city of 
telepaths. 

But this shunning of him wasn’t 
natural. He came to a sudden halt, 
resting his pack and feeling the 
absurdity of the situation. How 
could any race be so incurious? 

And then he was aware of a 
subtle feeling in the air, a feeling 
of withdrawal, of polite annoy- 
ance at being intruded on, and 
recognized that he was feeling the 
cumulative emotions of several 
thousand Vernans. But why 
should they regard him as an in- 
truder? He meant them no harm. 
Anyway, what harm would he be 
able to do them? 

It must have been his predeces- 
sors, he thought disgustedly. 
They’d put on the Big White 
Chief act, getting the natives’ 
backs up right away. Well, he’d 
soon show them that wasn’t typi- 



cal of all Earthmen. And if they 
avoided him, he’d just have to go 
to a place that he would have 
sought out in any case — a hotel. 
They must have some such place 
here. They’d have to take notice 
of him then, surely. He didn’t 
know how he’d get over the prob- 
lem of payment, but he’d work 
that one out when he came to it. 

He shouldered his pack again 
and set off. He passed places with 
boards over them like medieval 
shop signs. One showed a pot, 
another what was obviously some 
item of grocery. But hotels seemed 
few and far between. 

But at last he came to a sign 
with a jug and what looked like a 
Venetian blind but could con- 
ceivably have been a folding bed. 
At any rate, it looked like the 
equivalent of bed and breakfast. 
He went in. 

He knew immediately he was 
in the right place. Potted plants 
stood around the foyer. The foyer 
was deserted. But there was a 
desk and an alert-looking desk 
clerk. 

TT UMPHREY strode up to him, 
determinedly radiating 
friendliness. At least, he hoped he 
was projecting. He evidently suc- 
ceeded, for the clerk stopped 
backing away, but looked baffled. 

And Humphrey, to his disap- 
pointment, got no mental signal 
back. Until, suddenly, he stepped 



VERBAL AGREEMENT 



83 



into an aura of communication. 

“Yes?” the clerk seemed to say. 
And a kind of implication of 
status came over, too. This was 
the proprietor, not a clerk. “Ex- 
cuse my hesitation. I thought—” 
The message faded away in a 
whirl of images. Humphrey made 
out a stool, a lamp, a scroll. 

Some kind of hospitality ritual, 
Humphrey decided. “Can you fix 
me up with a room?” he asked. 

The whirl of images stopped. 
“Have you payment?” An image 
came of octagonal coins. 

“No, but I wondered if — well, 
I could clean dishes or help 
around the place.” 

The Vernan looked dubious. 
“Just a moment. I’ll call my wife.” 

Humphrey got a queer sensa- 
tion then as the clerk turned away 
slightly. He got a clear image, but 
not of a wife — of some kind of 
plant. 

But it was most positively a 
woman who obeyed the call! 

“I was just asking your good 
husband — ” Humphrey started, 
and stopped, confusion spreading 
through him like a fire. 

“Pardon me,” he blurted and 
made off, suddenly remembered 
the pack that he had grounded by 
the desk, went back for it and 
staggered out of the hotel. 

He got well away before he 
dumped his burden and sat down, 
sweating, on the stone balustrade 
of a fountain. He was beginning 

84 



to have an inkling of the difficul- 
ties that had faced his predeces- 
sors on Verna. 

For telepathy obviously wasn’t 
so simple. He had never had to 
think about it before in his life, 
but he had imagined it would be a 
straightforward enough process. 
Now he tried to reason it out. 

These people used telepathy in- 
stead of speech, whereas we speak 
only what we want to say. They 
must have some telepathic paral- 
lel-some check over what they 
emitted. But he hadn’t! Nor had 
his predecessors. They must have 
learned what he had learned — 
just what a human’s thoughts in- 
volved. 

As just now, for instance. Did 
his looking at a pretty female 
really involve what he had got 
back, reflected shockingly from 
her receptive mind? All that? 

He shrugged. What if it did? It 
was only natural, wasn’t it? And 
wasn’t it natural for Vernans, too? 
It must be, otherwise it wouldn’t 
have had that outraged effect on 
the hotelkeeper’s wife; it would 
have been meaningless. And it 
was innocent enough. One didn’t 
go around making intimate pro- 
posals to every girl one passed in 
the street. 

But hadn’t he done just that? 
And not in her ear. In that mo- 
ment of flurry, he had been con- 
scious that the husband had been 
in on the hook-up, too. Naturally. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



And who else within radius? Be- 
cause it was obvious that they 
were more sensitive in their re- 
ceiving than he was. The hotel- 
keeper had got his own message 
before he had stepped into the 
hotelkeeper’s range. 

But when that woman had 
called to the children, he had got 
that. But she had seemed to 
shout. If it had been a mental 
“shout,” that seemed to indicate a 
measure of control. His problem 
was in the opposite direction — 
how did one learn to whisper? 

T>ONDERING for minutes, he 
finally came up with the con- 
clusion that everything would be 
all right as long as he confined his 
dealings to men. They would be 
the ones he’d have to see about 
grath skins and that was all that 
mattered, wasn’t it? Unless — the 
thought halted him— this was a 
female-governed society. Well, 
he’d have to find out. 

He put on his pack again wear- 
ily and set off in search of author- 
ity. One large building stood out 
in the center of the city. He 
headed for it. 

He approached it from across 
what looked like, by its size and 
the statuary dotted around it, the 
city’s main square. That, and the 
knot of people clustered around 
the entrance, reinforced his notion 
that it was the seat of rule. The 
crowd melted away as he strode 



across the square, leaving the en- 
trance completely deserted as he 
went in. 

But a dark-togaed doorkeeper 
stood his ground in the hall. Hum- 
phrey got an immediate sensation 
of resentment. But he’d met worse 
than that from doorkeepers on 
Earth. 

“I want to see the chief,” he an- 
nounced briskly. 

The resentment melted into a 
lot of images, just as the hotel- 
keeper’s reaction had. But this 
time of a spinning sun, a multi- 
headed beast. 

Humphrey repeated his ques- 
tion. 

The doorkeeper shrugged. “Hold 
on.” He departed down a long 
corridor. After several minutes, he 
came back. “The chief will see 
you. Seventh blue door on the 
left.” 

Telepathy had its clumsy side, 
Humphrey reflected as hp went 
down the corridor. Vernans might 
be able to “shout,” but even they 
evidently couldn’t beam it. Or 
maybe sheer distance had de- 
feated the doorkeeper, he thought, 
passing gray doors, green doors, 
orange, white, red. From them, as 
he passed, he got a slight but dis- 
concerting sensation of annoy- 
ance — at him, from the people be- 
hind them. He felt like opening 
each door and apologizing, but 
suspected that 5\ight only make 
matters worse.

85 




The corridor turned at right 
angles before he reached the sev- 
enth blue door. After a moment of 
hesitation, he went in. 

An aged giant with faded fair 
locks and a dark blue toga rose, 
bowed stiffly and sat down again, 
gesturing Humphrey to a chair. 

“What can I do for you?” came 
the chief’s message. It carried 
overtones of massive authority 
and irritation. And only one image 
— a vast, prickly hedge. 

“I want to buy grath skins,” 
Humphrey told him, realizing 
with sudden panic that he had 
neither seen one yet nor knew 
who had given them that name. A 
telepathic race didn’t have names, 
surely, or perhaps the beasts were 
called after the noise they made? 

A NYWAY, the chief under- 
stood immediately. Hum- 
phrey received a blast of anger. 
“I told the ones who came before 
you that they were not for sale. 
Didn’t they tell you?” 

Humphrey gave up the attempt 
to explain. “No,” he confessed. 
“Do you mind telling me?” 
“Because the barbaric society 
you come from has nothing to 
offer us in exchange. Grath skins 
are scarce, just enough to go 
around for our own use. We could 
hunt more, but there is no induce- 
ment.” 

Humphrey had already fished 
out his catalogue. “But we can 

86 



offer many valuable things. Tape 
players, cyberscopes, rocket 
craft — ” 

He stopped, conscious that the 
chief was roaring his head off tele- 
pathically, though no sound es- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




caped his tight, motionless lips. 

“Toys!” the chief exploded. 
“What do we want with such 
things? What use are the products 
of a people who cannot even con- 
trol their thoughts?” 



Humphrey started to get indig- 
nant. “I don’t see that you’ve got 
so much to be smug about. Your 
setup strikes me as pretty primi- 
tive. You haven’t got mechanical 
transport, radio, 3-D T.V.— ”

87 



“Meaningless symbols,” the 
chief said. 

“Well, they’re not meaningless 
in practice. How would you like 
to move around at two hundred — 
well, many times faster than a 
man can run? Or speak to—” He 
suddenly remembered and erased 
that one, but added enthusiasti- 
cally, “How would you like to see 
what’s going on on the other side 
of Verna — in living color?” 

The chief laughed again, but 
with considerable weariness. “If I 
want to see what goes on on the 
other side of Verna, I can go 
there. Or hire artists. We have ex- 
cellent artists.” 

“But the time!” Humphrey per- 
sisted. 

“We live many years.” 

Humphrey started then, sud- 
denly allowed sight of all the cir- 
cuits of the Vernan sun that the 
old man had seen. It was like see- 
ing the rings of a vast and ancient 
tree. Whatever the length of the 
Vernan year, it added up to a 
large chunk of time. Humphrey 
began to get the Vernan view- 
point in perspective. He strove 
against it. 

“But all these things we can 
offer — there must be something 
there you need. Here’s a whole 
section on installations, services. 
How would you like a latest 
model sanitation system for your 
city? Or complete pan-urban air- 
conditioning?” 



The chief shook his head. 

“A MiniSol power station, then? 
Compact, clean, sufficient to sup- 
ply power for — ” 

“I’ve heard it all before,” the 
chief told him. “We don’t need 
any of those things. Sanitation we 
have. Air-conditioning we don’t 
need. Power?” He shrugged. “We 
have a greater power. And a 
greater gift than any you can offer 
us. In telepathy we have commu- 
nication, and in communication 
peace. Behind all the things you 
offer me, there is a picture of a 
desperately unbalanced people, 
struggling to make up for the lack 
of that one gift. If your people 
could only relax, they might find 
in themselves that power. Or they 
might have done so once. I fear it 
is atrophied in them now.” 

TTUMPHREY stirred. “But we 
do have it, wouldn’t you 
say? How else could you commu- 
nicate with me?” 

“Only because our own powers 
are refined — so refined that your 
crude thinking processes are like 
a scream in our minds. Do you 
understand now why your people 
are not welcome here?” 

“I’m sorry,” Humphrey apolo- 
gized. “But — I thought you peo- 
ple had control.” 

“Only of transmission, and that 
is a complicated process. We can 
project, in an emergency, for—” 
Humphrey had a mental image of 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a distance that he guessed at 
about half a mile. “The cleverer 
among us can reduce our thoughts 
so as not to disturb our neighbors, 
though we are used to a back- 
ground level of thought. You will 
understand that there are varying 
degrees of intensity as well as 
varying degrees of individual con- 
trol.” 

“Couldn’t I learn control?” 

The chief smiled tolerantly. 
“Ages of development were 
needed for our people to learn 
how to handle their powers. It 
would be impossible for a stranger 
to learn even in a whole lifetime. 
The system of etiquette is ex- 
tremely complex.” 

Humphrey was beginning to 
understand. “Like throwing up 
screens of images?” 

“Ah, you’ve recognized that? 
Yes, that is a part of it. We subli- 
mate the stronger emotions that 
way. The greater control a person 
has, the more refined he is re- 
garded by his fellows.” 

Humphrey could see parallels 
with speech on Earth. “So that a 
man, addressing his girl friend or 
wife in public, would symbolize 
her — as a plant, say?” 

“Exactly. As a plant or flower 
or whatever was customary be- 
tween them. More intimate 
thoughts would be reserved for 
private occasions.” 

“I see.” 

The chief drew a hand across 



his brow. “I am tired. The inter- 
view is at an end.” He caught 
Humphrey’s apology. “Thank you, 
but it is not because of age. The 
telepathic faculty becomes richer 
with age, but somewhat less sen- 
sitive to shock. The average per- 
son could not have stood contact 
with you for a fraction of this 
time.” 

Humphrey rose. There was 
plainly nothing more to be said. 
He shouldered his pack and made 
for the door. 

“Oh, just one thing more,” the 
chief called after him. Humphrey 
turned. “In case you should think 
of going out to hunt grath your- 
self, I ought to warn you that 
grath also are telepathic in a sim- 
ple but highly sensitive way. 
They can scent a thought a long 
way off.” He smiled. “I should 
think they’d be able to detect 
yours before you even started 
out.” 

“Then how do your people do 
it?” 

“Our hunters have the culti- 
vated ability of fooling the grath 
by aping the beast’s thought proc- 
esses. The grath would rather be- 
lieve his thoughts than his eyes.” 

ZOOMING out into the waning 
^ light of the Vernan day, 
Humphrey felt wretched. It was 
clear enough now why his prede- 
cessors, for all their high A.Q.s, 
had found the assignment an im-

possible one. An Earthman was 
about as welcome here as a visitor 
to Earth would be who went 
around making a noise like a 
buzz-saw. Only this was worse, be- 
ing much more complicated. 

He thought bitterly of the irony 
of it — of himself, a poet, a weaver 
of words, coming up against a race 
who hadn’t the slightest need of 
them. His dreams of new vistas 
had already withered; now they 
looked pitiable. 

Well, there was only one thing 
to do — settle down to being a 
pariah for the next seven days, 
until he could get a call through 
to Smith III — and for however 
long after that they took to send 
a ship to pick him up. There was 
no sense in trying any further. 
These people were pretty polite, 
under the circumstances, but test- 
ing their patience any more might 
be dangerous. 

Night came with conventional 
tropical suddenness. Smoky yel- 
low lights sprang up in the win- 
dows of the buildings. Humphrey 
sighed and looked around for a 
parking place. He found one in 
the angle of the plinth of a statue 
in the main square. He threw his 
pack down and himself by it. Mis- 
erably he took out his case of cap- 
sules and swallowed a couple of 
them. He settled down for the 
night — or tried to. 

For although it was peaceful — 
the Vernans continued to give 

90 



him a wide berth — the daytime 
warmth soon ebbed from the air. 
He shivered and drew his jerkin 
tighter about him, thinking dark 
thoughts of Crump and even 
darker ones of his own foolhardi- 
ness. 

He fell asleep at last, but 
seemed to rebound immediately 
into wakefulness. A brilliant moon 
was shining full in his face and 
he thought at first that that was 
what had wakened him. Then he 
became conscious of two round 
violet eyes peering at him around 
the plinth. He lifted himself on an 
elbow. 

A figure stepped out into the 
moonlight and came up to him. 
Steady, Humphrey told himself 
and thought frantically of an ele- 
phant— as violent a contrast to 
this graceful creature as his sleep- 
fuddled mind could think of. He 
could at least try to conform to 
local usage, however hopeless the 
chief had said it would be for him. 

The girl was holding out a cloak 
that shimmered in the moonlight. 
She wore a similar one clasped at 
her throat. 

“A grath skin,” she explained. 
“I saw you and couldn’t bear the 
thought of your sleeping out here 
without cover.” 

“Thank you,” Humphrey an- 
swered gratefully, taking the cloak 
and laying it over his cramped 
limbs. It was wonderfully warm, 
for all its lightness. He saw now 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




why Crump was anxious to get 
his hands on a supply. 

“It’s only an old one,” the girl 
told him apologetically. 

“It’s fine, thank you. Where 
shall I return it?” 

“You can keep it.” 

“I can? You’re very kind.” 
Humphrey turned over, hitching 
the cloak over his shoulders, an- 



noyed that a meeting with a 
pretty girl by moonlight should 
find him at such a disadvantage. 

TTE was conscious that the girl 
didn’t go away. He felt the 
nearness of her mind and realized 
that she was young, equivalent to 
an Earth seventeen-year-old. Her 
thoughts were like those of any

kid doing something daring. But 
he didn’t enjoy being the subject 
of them, hated being in her mind 
something like a cross between a 
caged animal and a forbidden 
fruit. He stirred and turned back 
to her. 

“Now look here, I’m grateful, 
but—” 

The girl suddenly laughed. Just 
as suddenly, she bit her lip. Hum- 
phrey got a clear impression that 
she knew she had done something 
not considered good form. But he 
was surprised at hearing a sound 
—any sound— escaping a Veman’s 
lips. 

“Don’t tell me you can speak?” 
he said. And said it aloud, to show 
what he meant. 

He felt her embarrassment. A 
screen of images went up, but 
scattered, tenuous, as if she hadn’t 
mastered the art yet. Now it was 
his turn to laugh. 

In her embarrassment, she 
looked even prettier. Humphrey 
took a grip on himself. He thought 
desperately of the elephant again, 
but the image wasn’t effective 
enough by half. 

“Why don’t you clear off?” he 
radiated angrily, then caught the 
answer. Partly from her mind, but 
that was only a confirmation of a 
thought from another quarter. He 
jerked around angrily and caught 
sight of several heads disappear- 
ing around the corner of a build- 
ing. 

92 



“You’re doing this for a bet!” 
he accused her furiously. 

She looked awkward, but didn’t 
budge. 

“All right,” he said. “You’ll win 
the hard way. I hope it gives you 
a headache!” 

He dived in his pack. He pulled 
out an anthology and opened it at 
random. He read out loud in as 
clear and ringing a voice as he 
could produce: 

From the dark woods that breathe 
of fallen showers, 

Harnessed with level rays in golden 
reins, 

The zebras draw the dawn across 
the plains 

Wading knee-deep among the scarlet 
flowers. 

The sunlight, zither ing their flanks 
with fire, 

Flashes between the shadows as — 
as — 

He faltered, aware of the girl’s 
marvelous violet eyes upon him. 
But aware of something more — of 
her mind seized by his. Not fright- 
ened, disturbed, resentful, the only 
reactions he had met so far on 
Verna, but — yes, fascinated. And 
clamoring now for him to go on. 
He complied dazedly: 

— as they pass 

Barred with electric tremors through 
the grass 

Like wind along the gold strings of 
a lyre . 

He went on to the end. Com- 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



plete communion seemed to reign 
between them. 

« W HAT is that?” she asked 
wonderingly at last. 

“Poetry,” he said aloud. 

“Pur — tree,” she said, and 
laughed delightedly. 

“You can speak!” he said. But 
why had the verse, a piece by a 
twentieth-century poet, had such 
an effect on her? An effect that he 
could feel! Was it because the 
words concentrated symbols? And 
concentrated his own mind, too, as 
he read, so that his thoughts were 
no longer harsh and crude to a 
Vernan mind? No — positively 
welcome. 

It seemed fantastic, impossible, 
almost wholly incredible. 

But was it? Vemans only used 
symbols in a system of manners. 
Had they never, then, experienced 
the richness, the delight of them? 
Words were the magical power 
that drew images together, focus- 
ing them, relating one with an- 
other. And Vernans had never 
had need of words. 

Didn’t that explain a lot? Their 
lack of drive, for one thing. Hadn’t 
a large part of Man’s struggle up- 
ward risen from the sheer neces- 
sity to communicate? 

He felt the dawning of a great 
idea, the solution. But — 

“Yes!” the girl broke in eagerly 
upon his thoughts. “Yes!” 

“I don’t know. You’re young. 



The young always welcome inno- 
vations. But how about the older 
ones?” 

She dismissed the thought with 
a pout. “When their eyes are 
opened to what they have missed, 
they will fall over themselves to 
sample it.” Her own unbelievable 
eyes lit up. “I’ll be your prophet.” 

He had a sharp twinge of doubt, 
of conscience. Who could know 
what the ultimate effects would 
be? He might be laying a powder 
train. Maybe the Vernans were a 
lot of stick-in-the-muds, but it was 
a stable and peaceful stretch of 
mud. What right had he to dis- 
turb it? 

“It is more than a right — it is a 
duty,” the girl told him firmly. 

“You think so?” He faltered. 
“How have you managed all this 
time without names? What can I 
call you?” 

“Call? Oh, I don’t know.” 

It was that elementary impasse 
that made Humphrey’s mind up 
for him. A telepathic race did lack 
a whale of a lot of things, all for 
the lack of names. Accurate dis- 
tances, shop names, those little 
things he had noticed. But, vastly 
more important, records. 

A race built itself on the accu- 
mulated wisdom of previous gen- 
erations, didn’t it? But a race 
without language had no means of 
preserving that wisdom beyond 
the vehicle of the brain— and why 
should even a telepathic Vernan 



VERBAL AGREEMENT 



93 



brain be less fallible than any 
other? 

“I know what I’ll call you,” 
Humphrey said, delighted at the 
thought. “Calliope. The muse of 
poetry.” 

“Cal-eye-o-pee,” she said, radi- 
ating pleasure. 

“Right, then,” he told her. “I’ll 
start tomorrow.” 

“We’ll start tomorrow.” She 
snuggled up to him. “But now — 
more poetry.” 

S EVEN days later. Crump re- 
ceived a cable from Smith III, 
relayed from Humphrey on Verna. 

Initial order one thousand grath 
skins, to be delivered in bimonthly 
installments two hundred. Payment 
per skin: one copy each Gardner’s 
Diamond Treasury of English Lyric, 
one terran grammar, one terran di- 
tionary — 

Crump winced. Finding out that 
the Vemans were telepathic had 
obviously gone to the young fool’s 
head. He read on. Then it became 



clear. The last sentence crystal- 
lized it. He flipped Clapperton’s 
switch gleefully and summoned 
him to his office. 

He told him the news. Clapper- 
ton’s reaction was the same as 
Crump’s had been at first. 

“I don’t believe it,” he said 
flatly. 

“I’ll read on,” Crump said. “ ‘Ad- 
vise Clapperton to revise his me- 
thod. He must have thrown the 
first two men as he threw me. I 
was so busy trying to adapt that 
I nearly missed the answer. Luck- 
ily I saw it in time and was quali- 
fied to exploit it. Clapperton was 
right, but not right enough. An or- 
ganism in a strange environment 
either has to adapt to it, get out or 
go under. But there’s a fourth 
course — ’” 

Crump paused and his eye held 
a glint that, although he couldn’t 
know it, was a close cousin to the 
one that had been in Humphrey’s 
as he had tapped away at a black 
box on distant Verna — “‘Adapt 
the environment to itself.’”

Human Man’s 
Burden 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 



Massa Flaswell was lonely on 



his cold, cold planetoid . 



till it got hot and crowded! 



Illustrated by WEISS 



E dward flaswell 

bought his planetoid, sight 
unseen, at the Interstellar 
Land Office on Earth. He selected 
it on the basis of a photograph, 
which showed little more than a 
range of picturesque mountains. 
But Flaswell loved mountains 
and as he remarked to the Claims 
Clerk, “Might be gold in them 



thar hills, mightn’t thar, pardner?” 
“Sure, pal, sure,” the clerk re- 
sponded, wondering what man in 
his right mind would put himself 
several light-years from the near- 
est woman of any description 
whatsoever. No man in his right 
mind would, the clerk decided, 
and gave Flaswell a searching 
look. 



HUMAN MAN'S BURDEN 



95 



But Flaswell was perfectly sane. 
He just hadn’t stopped to con- 
sider the problem. 

Accordingly, Flaswell put down 
a small sum in credits and made 
a large promise to improve his 
land every year. As soon as the 
ink was dry upon his deed, he 
purchased passage aboard a sec- 
ond-class drone freighter, loaded 
it with an assortment of second- 
hand equipment and set out for 
his holdings. 

Most novice pioneers find they 
have purchased a sizable chunk 
of naked rock. Flaswell was lucky. 
His planetoid, which he named 
Chance, had a minimal manufac- 
tured atmosphere that he could 
boost to breathable status. There 
was water, which his well-digging 
equipment tapped on the twenty- 
third attempt. He found no gold 
in them thar hills, but there was 
some exportable thorium. And 
best of all, much of the soil was 
suitable for the cultivation of dir, 
olge, smis and other luxury fruits. 

As Flaswell kept telling his ro- 
bot foreman, “This place is going 
to make me rich!” 

“Sure, Boss, sure,” the robot al- 
ways responded. 

T HE planetoid had undeniable 
promise. Its development was 
an enormous task for one man, 
but Flaswell was only twenty- 
seven years old, strongly built 
and of a determined frame of 

96 



mind. Beneath his hand, the pla- 
netoid flourished. Months passed 
and Flaswell planted his fields, 
mined his picturesque mountains 
and shipped his goods out by the 
infrequent drone freighter that 
passed his way. 

One day, his robot foreman 
said to him, “Boss Man, sir, you 
don’t look too good, Mr. Flas- 
well, sir.” 

Flaswell frowned at this speech. 
The man he had bought his robots 
from had been a Human Supremi- 
cist of the most rabid sort, who 
had coded the robots’ responses 
according to his own ideas of the 
respect due Human People. Flas- 
well found this annoying, but he 
couldn’t afford new response 
tapes. And where else could he 
have picked up robots for so lit- 
tle money? 

“Nothing wrong with me, Gun- 
ga-Sam,” Flaswell replied. 

“Ah! I beg pardon! But this is 
not so, Mr. Flaswell, Boss. You 
have been talking to yourself in 
the fields, you should excuse my 
saying it.” 

“Aw, it’s nothing.” 

“And you have the beginning of 
a tic in your left eye, sahib. And 
your fingers are trembling. And 
you are drinking too much. 
And-” 

“That’s enough, Gunga-Sam. A 
robot should know his place,” 
Flaswell said. He saw the hurt ex- 
pression that the robot’s metal 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



face somehow managed to con- 
vey. He sighed and said, “You’re 
right, of course. You’re always 
right, old friend. What’s the mat- 
ter with me?” 

“You are bearing too much of 
the Human Man’s Burden.” 

“Don’t I know it!” Flaswell ran 
a hand through his unruly black 
hair. “Sometimes I envy you ro- 
bots. Always laughing, carefree, 
happy—” 

“It is because we have no 
souls.” 

“Unfortunately I do. What do 
you suggest?” 

“Take a vacation, Mr. Flaswell, 
Boss,” Gunga-Sam suggested, and 
wisely withdrew to let his master 
think. 

Flaswell appreciated his servi- 
tor’s kindly suggestion, but a va- 
cation was difficult. His planetoid, 
Chance, was in the Throcian Sys- 
tem, which was about as isolated 
as one could get in this day and 
age. True, he was only a fifteen- 
day flight from the tawdry amuse- 
ments of Cythera III and not 
much farther from Nagondicon, 
where considerable fun could be 
obtained for the strong in stom- 
ach. But distance is money, and 
money was the very thing Flas- 
well was trying to make on 
Chance. 

TTE planted more crops, dug 
more thorium and began to 
grow a beard. He continued to 



mumble to himself in the fields 
and to drink heavily in the eve- 
nings. Some of the simple farm 
robots grew alarmed when Flas- 
well lurched past and they began 
praying to the outlawed Combus- 
tion God. But loyal Gunga-Sam 
soon put a stop to this ominous 
turn of events. 

“Ignorant mechanicals!” he told 
them. “The Boss Human, he all 
right. Him strong, him good! Be- 
lieve me, brothers, it is even as 
I say!” 

But the murmurings did not 
cease, for robots look to Humans 
to set an example. The situation 
might have gotten out of hand if 
Flaswell had not received, along 
with his next shipment of food, a 
shiny new Roebuck-Ward cata- 
logue. 

Lovingly he spread it open 
upon his crude plastic table and, 
by the glow of a simple cold-light 
bulb, began to pore over its con- 
tents. What wonders there were 
for the isolated pioneer! Home 
distilling plants, and moon mak- 
ers, and portable solidovision, 
and — 

Flaswell turned a page, read it, 
gulped and read it again. It said: 

MAIL ORDER BRIDES! 

Pioneers, why suffer the curse of 
loneliness alone? Why bear the Hu- 
Man's Burden singly? Roebuck-Ward 
is now offering, for the first time, a 
limited selection of Brides for the 
Frontiersman! 



HUMAN MAN'S BURDEN 



97 



The Roebuck-Ward Frontier Model 
Bride is carefully selected for strength, 
adaptability, agility, perseverance, 
pioneer skills and, of course, a mea- 
sure of comeliness. These girls are 
conditioned to any planet, since they 
possess a relatively low center of 
gravity, a skin properly pigmented 
for all climates, and short, strong toe 
and fingernails. Shapewise, they are 
well proportioned and yet not dis- 
tractingly contoured, a quality which 
the hard-working pioneer should ap- 
preciate. 

The Roebuck-Ward Frontier Model 
comes in three general sizes {see spe- 
cifications below) to suit any man's 
taste. Upon receipt of your request, 
Roebuck-Ward will quick-freeze one 
and ship her to you by third-class 
Drone Freight. In this way, your ex- 
press charges are kept to an absolute 
minimum. 

Why not order a Frontier Model 
Bride TODAY? 

Flaswell called for Gunga-Sam 
and showed him the advertise- 
ment. Silently the mechanical 
read, then looked his master full 
in the face. 

“This is surely it, effendi,” the 
foreman said. 

“You think so, huh?” Flaswell 
stood up and began to pace nerv- 
ously around the room. “But I 
wasn’t planning on getting mar- 
ried just yet. I mean what kind of 
a way is this to get married? How 
do I know I’ll like her?” 

“It is proper for Human Man 
to have Human Woman.” 

“Yeah, but-” 

“Besides, do they quick-freeze 
a preacher and ship him out, too?” 



A slow smile broke over Flas- 
well’s face as he digested his 
servant’s shrewd question. “Gun- 
ga-Sam,” he said, “as usual, you 
have gone directly to the heart of 
the matter. I guess there’s a sort 
of moratorium on the ceremony 
while a man makes up his mind. 
Too expensive to quick-freeze a 
preacher. And it would be nice to 
have a gal around who could work 
her share.” 

Gunga-Sam managed to convey 
an inscrutable smile. 

Flaswell sat down and ordered 
a Frontier Model Bride, specify- 
ing the small size, which he felt 
was plenty big enough. He gave 
Gunga-Sam the order to radio. 

T HE next few weeks were filled 
with excitement for Flas- 
well and he began to scan the 
skies anxiously. The robots picked 
up the mood of anticipation. In 
the evenings, their carefree songs 
and dances were interspersed with 
whispering and secret merriment. 
The mechanicals said to Gunga- 
Sam over and over again, “Hey, 
Foreman! The new Human Wo- 
man Boss, what will she be like?” 
“It’s none of your concern,” 
Gunga-Sam told them. “That’s 
Human Man business and you 
robots leave it alone.” But at the 
end, he was watching the skies as 
anxiously as anyone. 

During those weeks, Flaswell 
meditated on the virtues of Fron- 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




HUMAN MAN'S BURDEN 



99 



tier Woman. The more he thought 
about it, the more he liked the 
idea. No pretty, useless, helpless 
painted woman for him! How 
pleasant it would be to have a 
cheerful, common-sense, down-to- 
gravity gal who could cook, wash, 
pretty up the place, boss the 
house robots, make clothes, put 
up jellies. 

So he dreamed away the time 
and bit his nails to the quick. 

At last the drone freighter 
flashed across the horizon, landed, 
jettisoned a large packing case, 
and fled in the direction of Amyra 
IV. 

The robots brought the case to 
Flaswell. 

“Your new bride, sir!” they 
shouted triumphantly, and flung 
their oilcans in the air. 

Flaswell immediately pro- 
claimed a half-day holiday and 
soon he was alone in his living 
room with the great frigid box 
marked “Handle with Care. Wo- 
man Inside.” 

He pressed the defrosting con- 
trols, waited the requisite hour, 
and opened the box. Within was 
another box, which required two 
hours to defrost. Impatiently he 
waited, pacing up and down the 
room and gnawing on the rem- 
nants of his fingernails. 

And then the time was up, and 
with shaking hands, Flaswell 
opened the lid and saw — 

“Hey, what is this?” he cried. 



r I t HE girl within the box blinked, 
yawned like a kitten, opened 
her eyes, sat up. They stared at 
each other and Flaswell knew that 
something was terribly wrong. 

She was clothed in a beautiful, 
impractical white dress and her 
name, Sheila, was worked upon 
it in gold thread. The next thing 
Flaswell noticed was her slender- 
ness, which was scarcely suitable 
for hard work on outplanet con- 
ditions. Her skin was a creamy 
white, obviously the kind that 
would blister under his planetoid’s 
fierce summer sun. Her hands 
were long-fingered, red-nailed, ele- 
gant— completely unlike anything 
the Roebuck-Ward Company had 
promised. As for her legs and 
other parts, Flaswell decided they 
would be very well on Earth, but 
not here, where a man must pay 
attention to his work. 

She couldn’t even be said to 
have a low center of gravity. 
Quite the contrary. 

Flaswell felt, not unreasonably, 
that he had been swindled, duped, 
made a fool of. 

Sheila stepped out of the crate, 
walked to a window and looked 
out over Flaswell’s flowering 
green fields and his picturesque 
mountains beyond them. 

“But where are the palm 
trees?” she asked. 

“Palm trees?” 

“Of course. They told me that 
Srinigar V had palm trees.” 



100 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“This is not Srinigar V,” Flas- 
well said. 

“But aren’t you the Pasha of 
Srae?” Sheila gasped. 

“Certainly not. I am a Fron- 
tiersman. Aren’t you a Frontier 
Model Bride?” 

“Do I look like a Frontier 
Model Bride?” Sheila snapped, 
her eyes flashing. “I am the Ultra 
Deluxe Luxury Model Bride and 
I was supposed to go to the sub- 
tropical paradise planet of Srini- 
gar V.” 

“We’ve both been cheated. The 
shipping department must have 
made an error,” Flaswell said 
gloomily. 

The girl looked around Flas- 
well’s crude living room and a 
wince twinged her pretty fea- 
tures. “Oh, well. I suppose you 
can arrange transportation for me 
to Srinigar V.” 

“I can’t even afford to go to 
Nagondicon,” Flaswell said. “I will 
inform Roebuck-Ward of their er- 
ror. They will undoubtedly ar- 
range transportation for you, 
when they send me my Frontier 
Model Bride.” 

Sheila shrugged her shoulders. 
“Travel broadens one,” she said. 

Flaswell nodded. He was think- 
ing hard. This girl had, it was ob- 
vious, no pioneering qualities. But 
she was amazingly pretty. He 
saw no reason why her stay 
shouldn’t be a pleasant one for 
both. 



“Under the circumstances,” 
Flaswell said, with an ingratiating 
smile, “we might as well be 
friends.” 

“Under what circumstances?” 

“We are the only two Human 
People on the planet.” Flaswell 
rested a hand lightly on her shoul- 
der. “Let’s have a drink. Tell me 
all about yourself. Do you—” 

A T that moment, he heard a 
loud sound behind. He turned 
and saw a small, squat robot 
climbing from a compartment in 
the packing case. 

“What do you want?” Flaswell 
demanded. 

“I,” said the robot, “am a Mar- 
rying Robot, empowered by the 
government to provide legal mar- 
riages in space. I am further di- 
rected by the Roebuck-Ward 
Company to act as guardian, du- 
enna and protector for the young 
lady in my charge, until such time 
as my primary function, to per- 
form a ceremony of marriage, has 
been accomplished.” 

“Uppity damned robot,” Flas- 
well grumbled. 

“What did you expect?” Sheila 
asked. “A quick-frozen Human 
preacher?” 

“Of course not. But a robot 
duenna — ” 

“The very best kind,” she as- 
sured him. “You’d be surprised at 
how some men act when they get 
a few light-years from Earth.” 



HUMAN MAN'S BURDEN 



101 



“I would?” Flaswell said dis- 
consolately. 

“So I’m told,” Sheila replied, 
demurely looking away from him. 
“And after all, the promised bride 
of the Pasha of Srae should have 
a guardian of some sort.” 

“Dearly beloved,” the robot in- 
toned, “we are here gathered to 
join — ” 

“Not now,” Sheila said loftily. 
“Not this one.” 

“I’ll have the robots fix a room 
for you,” Flaswell growled, and 
walked away, mumbling to him- 
self about Human Man’s Burden. 

He radioed Roebuck-Ward and 
was told that the proper model 
Bride would be sent at once and 
the interloper shipped elsewhere. 
Then he returned to his farming 
and mining, determined to ignore 
the presence of Sheila and her 
duenna. 

Work continued on Chance. 
There was thorium to be mined 
out of the soil and new wells to 
dig. Harvest time was soon at 
hand, and the robots toiled for 
long hours in the green-blossomed 
fields, and lubricating oil glistened 
on their honest metal faces, and 
the air was fragrant with the per- 
fume of the dir flowers. 

Sheila made her presence felt 
with subtle yet surprising force. 
Soon there were plastic lamp- 
shades over the naked cold-light 
bulbs and drapes over the stark 
windows and scatter rugs on the 

102 



floors. And there were many other 
changes around the house that 
Flaswell felt rather than saw. 

His diet underwent a change, 
too. The robot chefs memory 
tape had worn thin in many spots, 
so all the poor mechanical could 
remember how to make was beef 
Stroganoff, cucumber salad, rice 
pudding and cocoa. Flaswell had, 
with considerable stoicism, been 
eating these dishes ever since he 
came to Chance, varying them oc- 
casionally with shipwreck rations. 

r l' , HEN Sheila took the robot 
-*• chef in hand. Patiently she 
impressed upon his memory tape 
the recipes for beef stew, pot 
roast, tossed green salad, apple 
pie, and many others. The eating 
situation upon Chance began to 
improve markedly. 

But when Sheila put up smis 
jelly in vacuum jars, Flaswell be- 
gan to have doubts. 

Here, after all, was a remark- 
ably practical young lady, in spite 
of her expensive appearance. She 
could do all the things a Frontier 
Wife could do. And she had other 
attributes. What did he need a 
regular Roebuck-Ward Frontier 
Model for? 

After mulling this for a while, 
Flaswell said to his foreman, 
“Gunga-Sam, I am confused.” 

“Ah?” said the foreman, his 
metal face impassive. 

“I guess I need a little of that 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



robot intuition. She’s doing very 
well, isn’t she, Gunga-Sam?” 
“The Human Woman is taking 
her proper share of Human Per- 
son’s Burden.” 

“She sure is. But can it last? 
She’s doing as much as any Fron- 
tier Model Wife could do, isn’t 
she? Cooking, canning—” 

“The workers love her,” Gunga- 
Sam said with simple dignity. 
“You did not know, sir, but when 
that rust epidemic broke out last 
week, she toiled night and day, 
bringing relief and comforting the 
frightened younger robots.” 

“She did all that?” Flaswell 
gasped, shaken. “But a girl of her 
background, a luxury model — ” 

“It does not matter. She is a 
Human Person and she has the 
strength and nobility to take on 
Human Person’s Burden.” 

“Do you know,” Flaswell said 
slowly, “this has convinced me. I 
really believe she is fit to stay 
here. It’s not her fault she isn’t a 
Frontier Model. That’s a matter 
of screening and conditioning, and 
you can’t change that. I’m going 
to tell her she can stay. And then 
I’ll cancel the other Roebuck 
order.” 

A strange expression glowed in 
the foreman’s eyes, an expression 
almost of amusement. He bowed 
low and said, “It shall be as the 
master wishes.” 

Flaswell hurried out to find 
Sheila. 

HUMAN MAN'S BURDEN 



CHE was in the sick bay, which 
^ had been constructed out of 
an old toolshed. With the aid of 
a robot mechanic, she was caring 
for the dents and dislocations that 
are the peculiar lot of metal- 
skinned beings. 

“Sheila,” Flaswell said, “I want 
to speak to you.” 

“Sure,” she answered absently, 
“as soon as I tighten this bolt.” 
She locked the bolt cleverly 
into place, and tapped the robot 
with her wrench. 

“There, Pedro,” she said, “try 
that leg now.” 

The robot stood up gingerly, 
put weight on the leg, found that 
it held. He capered comically 
around the Human Woman, say- 
ing, “You sure fixed it, Boss Lady. 
Gracias, ma’am.” 

And he danced out into the 
sunshine. 

Flaswell and Sheila watched 
him go, smiling at his antics. 
“They’re just like children,” Flas- 
well said. 

“One can’t help but love them,” 
Sheila responded. “They’re so 
happy, so carefree — ” 

“But they haven’t got souls,” 
Flaswell reminded her. 

“No,” she agreed somberly. 
“They haven’t. What did you wish 
to see me about?” 

“I wanted to tell you—” Flas- 
well looked around. The sick bay 
was an antiseptic place, filled with 
wrenches, screwdrivers, hacksaws, 

103 



ballpeen hammers and other 
medical equipment. It was hardly 
the atmosphere for the sort of 
announcement he was about to 
make. 

“Come with me,” he said. 

They walked out of the hospi- 
tal and through the blossoming 
green fields, to the foot of Flas- 
well’s spectacular mountains. 
There, shadowed by craggy cliffs, 
was a still, dark pool of water 
overhung with giant trees, which 
Flaswell had force-grown. Here 
they paused. 

“I wanted to say this,” Flas- 
well said. “You have surprised me 
completely, Sheila. I expected you 
would be a parasite, a purposeless 
person. Your background, your 
breeding, your appearance all 
pointed in this direction. But I 
was wrong. You have risen to the 
challenge of a Frontier environ- 
ment, have conquered it trium- 
phantly, and have won the hearts 
of everybody.” 

“Everybody?” Sheila asked very 
softly. 

“I believe I can speak for every 
robot on the planetoid. They ido- 
lize you. I think you belong here, 
Sheila.” 

The girl was silent for a long 
while, and the wind murmured 
through the boughs of the giant 
force-grown trees, and ruffled the 
black surface of the lake. 

Finally she said, “Do you think 
I belong here?” 

104 



Flaswell felt engulfed by her 
exquisite perfection, lost in the 
topaz depths of her eyes. His 
breath came fast, he touched her 
hand, her fingers clung. 

“Sheila. .” 

“Yes, Edward. .” 

“Dearly beloved,” a strident 
metallic boice barked, “we are 
here gathered—” 

“Not now, you fool!” Sheila 
cried. 

’ I ' HE Marrying Robot came for- 
ward and said sulkily, “Much 
as I hate to interfere in the af- 
fairs of Human People, my taped 
coefficients are such that I must. 
To my way of thinking, physical 
contact is meaningless. I have, by 
way of experiment, clashed limbs 
with a seamstress robot. All I got 
for my troubles was a dent. Once 
I thought I experienced some- 
thing, an electric something that 
shot through me giddily and made 
me think of slowly shifting geo- 
metric forms. But upon examina- 
tion, I discovered the insulation 
had parted from a conductor cen- 
ter. Therefore, the emotion was 
invalid.” 

“Uppity damned robot,” Flas- 
well growled. 

“Excuse my presumption. I was 
merely trying to explain that I 
personally find my instructions 
unintelligible— that is, to prevent 
any and all physical contact until 
a ceremony of marriage has been 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



performed. But there it is; those 
are my orders. Can’t I get it over 
with now?” 

“No!” said Sheila. 

The robot shrugged his shoul- 
ders fatalistically and slid into the 
underbrush. 

“Can’t stand a robot who doesn’t 
know his place,” said Flaswell. 
“But it’s all right.” 

“What?” 

“Yes,” Flaswell said, with an 
air of conviction. “You are as 
good as any Frontier Model Wife 
and far prettier. Sheila, will you 
marry me?” 

The robot, who had been 
thrashing around in the under- 
brush, now slid eagerly toward 
them. 

“No,” said Sheila. 

“No?” Flaswell repeated un- 
comprehendingly. 

“You heard me. No! Absolutely 
no!” 

“But why? You fit so well here, 
Sheila. The robots adore you. I’ve 
never seen them work so well — ” 

“I’m not interested in your ro- 
bots,” she said, standing very 
straight, her hair disheveled, her 
eyes blazing. “And I am not inter- 
ested in your planetoid. And I am 
most emphatically not interested 
in you. I am going to Srinigar V, 
where I will be the pampered 
bride of the Pasha of Srae!” 

They stared at each other, 
Sheila white-faced with anger, 
Flaswell red with confusion. 



The Marrying Robot said, 
“Now should I start the cere- 
mony? Dearly beloved. .” 
Sheila whirled and ran toward 
the house. 

“I don’t understand,” the Mar- 
rying Robot said plaintively. “It’s 
all very bewildering. When does 
the ceremony take place?” 

“It doesn’t,” Flaswell said, and 
stalked toward the house, his 
brows beetling with rage. 

The robot hesitated, sighed me- 
tallically and hurried after the 
Ultra Deluxe Luxury Model 
Bride. 

A LL that night, Flaswell sat in 
his room, drank deeply and 
mumbled to himself. Shortly af- 
ter dawn, the loyal Gunga-Sam 
knocked and slipped into the 
room. 

“Women!” Flaswell snarled to 
his servitor. 

“Ah?” said Gunga-Sam. 

“I’ll never understand them,” 
Flaswell said. “She led me on. I 
thought she wanted to stay here. 
I thought. .” 

“The mind of Human Man is 
murky and dark,” said Gunga- 
Sam, “but it is as crystal com- 
pared to the mind of Human Wo- 
man.” 

“Where did you get that?” Flas- 
well asked. 

“It is an ancient robot proverb.” 
“You robots. Sometimes I won- 
der if you don’t have souls.” 



HUMAN MAN'S BURDEN 



105 



“Oh, no, Mr. Flaswell, Boss. It 
is expressly written in our Con- 
struction Specifications that ro- 
bots are to be built with no souls, 
to spare them anguish.” 

“A very wise provision,” Flas- 
well said, “and something they 
might consider with Human Peo- 
ple, too. Well, to hell with her. 
What do you want?” 

“I came to tell you, sir, that the 
drone freighter is landing.” 

Flaswell turned pale. “So soon? 
Then it’s bringing my new bride!” 
“Undoubtedly.” 

“And it will take Sheila away 
to Srinigar V.” 

“Assuredly, sir.” 

Flaswell groaned and clutched 
his head. Then he straightened 
and said, “All right, all right. I’ll 
see if she’s ready.” 

He found Sheila in the living 
room, watching the drone freighter 
spiral in. She said, “The very best 
of luck, Edward. I hope your new 
bride fulfills all your expecta- 
tions.” 

The drone freighter landed and 
the robots began removing a large 
packing case. 

“I had better go,” Sheila said. 
“They won’t wait long.” She held 
out her hand. 

Flaswell took it. 

He held her hand for a mo- 
ment, then found he was holding 
her arm. She did not resist, nor 
did the Marrying Robot break 
into the room. Flaswell suddenly 



found that Sheila was in his arms. 
He kissed her and felt exactly like 
a small sun going nova. 

Finally she said, “Wow,” husk- 
ily, in a not quite believing voice. 

Flaswell cleared his throat 
twice. “Sheila, I love you. I can’t 
offer you much luxury here, but 
if you’d stay—” 

“It’s about time you found out 
you love me, you dope!” she said. 
“Of course I’m staying!” 

T HE next few minutes were ec- 
static and decidedly vertigi- 
nous. They were interrupted at 
last by the sound of loud robot 
voices outside. The door burst 
open and the Marrying Robot 
stamped in, followed by Gunga- 
Sam and two farm mechanicals. 

“Really!” the Marrying Robot 
said. “It is unbelievable! To think 
I’d see the day when robot pitted 
himself against robot!” 

“What happened?” Flaswell 
asked. 

“This foreman of yours sat on 
me,” the Marrying Robot said in- 
dignantly, “while his cronies held 
my limbs. I was merely trying to 
enter this room and perform my 
duty as set forth by the govern- 
ment and the Roebuck-Ward 
Company.” 

“Why, Gunga-Sam!” Flaswell 
said, grinning. 

The Marrying Robot hurried 
up to Sheila. “Are you damaged? 
Any dents? Any short-circuits?” 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“I don’t think so,” said Sheila 
breathlessly. 

Gunga-Sam said to Flaswell, 
“The fault is all mine. Boss, sir. 
But everyone knows that Human 
Man and Human Woman need 
solitude during the courtship pe- 
riod. I merely performed what I 
considered my duty to the Hu- 
man Race in this respect, Mr. 
Flaswell, Boss, sahib.” 

“You did well, Gunga-Sam,” 
Flaswell said. “I’m deeply grate- 
ful and — oh, Lord!” 

“What is it?” Sheila asked ap- 
prehensively. 

Flaswell was staring out the 
window. The farm robots were 
carrying the large packing case 
toward the house. 

“The Frontier Model Bride!” 
said Flaswell. “What’ll we do, 
darling? I canceled you and le- 
gally contracted for the other 
one. Do you think we can break 
the contract?” 

Sheila laughed. “Don’t worry. 
There’s no Frontier Model Bride 
in that box. Your order was can- 
celed as soon as it was received.” 

“It was?” 

“Certainly.” She looked down, 
ashamed. “You’ll hate me for 
this — ” 

“I won’t,” he promised. “What 
is it?” 

“Well, Frontiersmen’s pictures 
are on file at the Company, you 
know, so Brides can see what 
they’re getting. There is a choice 

HUMAN MAN'S BURDEN 



— for the girls, I mean — and I’d 
been hanging around the place so 
long, unable to get unclassified as 
an Ultra Deluxe, that I — I made 
friends with the head of the order 
department. And,” she said all in 
a rush, “I got myself sent here.” 
“But the Pasha of Srae — ” 

“I made him up.” 

“But why?” Flaswell asked puz- 
zledly. “You’re so pretty—” 

“That everybody expects me to 
be a toy for some spoiled, pudgy 
idiot,” she finished with a good 
deal of heat. “I don’t want to be! 
I want to be a wife! And I’m just 
as good as any chunky, homely 
female!” 

“Better,” he said. 

“I can cook and doctor robots 
and be practical, can’t I? Haven’t 
I proved it?” 

“Of course, dear.” 

She began to cry. "But nobody 
would believe it, so I had to trick 
you into letting me stay long 

enough to — to fall in love with 
>> 

me. 

“Which I did,” he said, drying 
her eyes for her. “It’s all worked 
out fine. The whole thing was a 
lucky accident.” 

What looked like a blush ap- 
peared on Gunga-Sam’s metallic 
face. 

“You mean it wasn’t an acci- 
dent?” Flaswell exclaimed. 

“Well, sir, Mr. Flaswell, effendi, 
it is well known that Human Man 
needs attractive Human Woman. 

107 



The Frontier Model sounded a 
little severe and Memsahib Sheila 
is a daughter of a friend of my 
former master. So I took the lib- 
erty of sending the order directly 
to her. She got her friend in the 
order department to show her 
your picture and ship her here. I 
hope you are not displeased with 
your humble servant for disobey- 
ing.” 

WW7 ELL , I’ll be damned,” Flas- 
well finally got out. “It’s 
like I always said — you robots 
understand Human People better 
than anyone.” He turned to 
Sheila. “But what is in that pack- 
ing case?” 

“My dresses and my jewelry, 
my shoes, my cosmetics, my hair 
styler, my—” 

“But -” 

“You want me to look nice 
when we go visiting, dear,” Sheila 
said. “After all, Cythera III is 
only fifteen days away. I looked 
it up before I came.” 

Flaswell nodded resignedly. 
You had to expect something like 
this from an Ultra Deluxe Luxury 
Model Bride. 

“Now!” Sheila said, turning to 
the Marrying Robot. 

The robot didn’t answer. 

“Now!” Flaswell shouted. 

“You’re quite sure?” the robot 
queried sulkily. 

“Yes! Get started!” 

“I just don’t understand,” the 



Marrying Robot said. “Why now? 
Why not last week? Am I the 
only sane one here? Oh, well. 
Dearly beloved. .” 

And the ceremony was held at 
last. Flaswell proclaimed a three 
day holiday and the robots sang 
and danced and celebrated in 
their carefree robot fashion. 

Thereafter, life was never the 
same on Chance. The Flaswells 
began to have a modest social 
life, to visit and be visited by 
couples fifteen and twenty days 
out, on Cythera III, Tham and 
Randico I. But the rest of the 
time, Sheila was an irreproach- 
able Frontier Wife, loved by the 
robots and idolized by her hus- 
band. The Marrying Robot, fol- 
lowing his instruction manual, re- 
trained himself as an accountant 
and bookkeeper, skills for which 
his mentality was peculiarly well 
suited. He often said the whole 
place would go to pieces if it 
weren’t for him. 

And the robots continued to 
dig thorium from the soil, and the 
dir, olge and smis blossomed, and 
Flaswell and Sheila shared to- 
gether the responsibility of Hu- 
man People’s Burden. 

Flaswell was always quite vocal 
on the advantages of shopping at 
Roebuck-Ward. But Sheila knew 
that the real advantage was in 
having a foreman like the loyal, 
soulless Gunga-Sam.

THE SEARCH FOR BRIDEY 
MURPHY by Morey Bernstein. 
Doubleday & Co., Inc., $3.75 

B RIDEY has captured the 
imagination of the American 
public as few books have since 
WW II. Mr. Bernstein, Senior, 
once remarked to Junior that Dr. 
J. B. Rhine of Duke “will never 
make a dime out of it,” meaning 
parapsychology, but that assur- 
edly does not hold true of his 
son’s book. Besides its phenome- 
nal sales, it is to be produced (as 
fiction?) by Hollywood. 

Its subject matter, reincarna- 



tion, is old hat. The more recent 
device, recall via hypnosis, is al- 
most as old. 

Then why has the book caught 
fire? Several guesses: Honest in- 
tellectual curiosity, the hope for 
communication with the hereafter 
such as follows every war, crack- 
pottery and cultism. Also, in 
itself it is blithe and breezily 
entertaining until it reaches the 
verbatim record of the several 
trances undergone by the subject, 
“Mrs. Simmons,” when it assumes 
an aura of authenticity. 

Is it authentic? That is the real 
question. Hypnotist and subject

insist it is. Authorities almost 
unanimously agree that the sub- 
ject, from books, plays or films 
that have sunk into her subcon- 
scious, has built up a character in 
obedience to a hypnotic command. 

Much of the data, if it actually 
existed, would be on public rec- 
ord. It isn’t. 

Nevertheless, though Bernstein 
contributes nothing new to our 
knowledge of hypnotism, the book 
may prove valuable in instigating 
valid research. 

REACH FOR TOMORROW by 
Arthur C. Clarke, Ballantine 
Books, $2.00 

T^ROM the first of his published 
stories to some of his most re- 
cent, this volume presents an ex- 
cellent cross-section of the art of 
one of science fiction’s foremost 
exponents. Should you wish to 
wean a neophyte, I can’t think of 
a better assortment or one better 
selected for change of pace. 

“Rescue Party,” Clarke’s first 
published story, remains as fresh 
and provocative after ten years 
as on publication. It is the only 
yarn in which Clarke gives full 
vent to his cosmic imagination, 
but that in no way detracts from 
the color and interest of the re- 
mainder. 

That he is capable of turning 
out pure horror is attested to in 
“A Walk In the Dark” and “The 

no 



Parasite.” The whimsical humor 
of “Trouble with the Natives” and 
the tongue-in-cheek sly clowning 
of “Jupiter Five” add spice to the 
collection. 

A couple of stories are some- 
what below the general level of 
the book, but who can quibble 
about the side-dishes when the 
main course is so appetizing? The 
volume is also available paper- 
bound. 

DOUBLE STAR by Robert A. 
Heinlein. Doubleday & Co., Inc., 
$2.95 

S OMEWHERE or other, I lost 
count, but I estimate this to be 
Heinlein’s twentieth book. His 
current offering is an excellent ex- 
ample of his ability to take one of 
the oldest plots in any literature, 
that of impersonation, and pre- 
sent it as an enjoyable reading 
experience. 

The story opens, as have count- 
less space operas, in a bar com- 
plete with Martians and a huge 
spaceman. After this prosaic be- 
ginning, however, any resemblance 
to space opera is accidental. 

The yam’s hero is an unlikely- 
seeming thespian named The 
Great Lorenzo, who has been 
picked by a futuristic IBM ma- 
chine as the likeliest impersona- 
tor of John J. Bonforte, leader of 
the Political Expansionist coali- 
tion. Seems as if some political 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



opponents of Bonforte have kid- 
naped him on the eve of a Mar- 
tian presentation in his honor. 

The Martians, sticklers for pro- 
tocol, would never forgive his ab- 
sence from such an honor for any 
reason except death, aside from 
which it would reflect unfavor- 
ably on all Earthmen. It is up to 
Lorenzo to carry off a masquer- 
ade that will deceive even close 
friends of the missing leader. 

I don’t think I’m giving the 
story away when I say that he 
succeeds, for the real story begins 
when he has to carry on beyond 
the acceptance of the Martian 
honor. 

The book does not measure up 
to the standards of the author’s 
Sixth Column or The Puppet 
Masters, but it makes pleasant 
and exciting reading. 

FORBIDDEN PLANET by 
W. J. Stuart. Farrar, Straus & 
Cudahy, Inc., $3.00 

T MUST admit that I ap- 
proached this book with a great 
deal of trepidation, as who 
wouldn’t, considering that it is 
based on a Cinemascope and color 
Hollywood film? Need I remind 
you of what they did to Jones’ 
This Island Earth? Can ycu vis- 
ualize what the book version of 
that would have been if based on 
the film? In color, yet! 

I am delighted to report that, 

***** SHELF 



though this is unabashed space 
opera, it is of a very superior kind. 
Stuart, whoever he might be, has 
done an excellent job of camou- 
flaging the obvious Hollywood 
touch. For instance, there’s a sci- 
entist and his beautiful daughter, 
marooned on a far-from-desert 
planet — scares you to, huh? — yet 
Stuart actually makes it palatable. 

He also carries off the difficult 
literary feat of telling his story in 
the first person singular from 
three different viewpoints: the 
scientist exposed to the superior 
knowledge of a long-dead race; 
the ship’s doctor of the expedition 
sent to rescue him; and the hard- 
bitten young commander of the 
rescue ship. 

Taut and tenseful despite its 
celluloid ancestry. 

MYSTERIES OF THE NORTH 
POLE by Robert de la Croix. The 
John Day Co., $3.50 

TJf^HEN, in the next couple of 
” hundred years, space travel 
has become a commonplace, some- 
one is going to write a Mysteries 
of the Asteroid Belt or M. o. t. 
Moon and it will read amazingly 
like this book. The protagonists 
will also be men of courage, dar- 
ing and physical fortitude and 
their enemy, environment, will be 
still more hostile, but advanced 
technology will tend to make an 
almost exact comparison possible.

Also, there will undoubtedly be 
visionaries, carried away by their 
confidence in some outre device, 
such as occurred in “Andre’s Fol- 
ly,” an account of a disastrous at- 
tempt to fly over the North Pole 
with a hydrogen-filled balloon. 
And the fantastic loss of life dur- 
ing the centuries-long search for 
the Northwest Passage will most 
likely be duplicated by expedi- 
tions seeking an economically 
feasible route through the As- 
teroid Belt. 

All in all, an invigorating exer- 
cise in extrapolation, such as the 
author never intended, that I rec- 
ommend highly to any fan with a 
restless imagination.

Seeing-Eye Dog 

By DANIEL F. GALOUYE 



The problem was not whether 



Curt could accept his being 



blind — It had to accept him! 



A MOSAIC of sound swirled 
in the impenetrable, op- 
pressive darkness: the 

sonorous ticking of the wall clock, 
the shrill cries of children at play, 
the distant blatancy of angry auto 
horns. 

Curt Markson gripped the 
knurled arm rests and leaned for- 
ward as though he might pierce 
the black pall. 



“But I’ve qualified, haven’t I?” 
Somewhere beyond the curtain 
of blackness, the director’s swivel 
chair creaked tentatively. “Yes — 
and no. Oh, you satisfy the objec- 
tive requirements. But I’m afraid, 
Mr. Markson, LITE cannot ap- 
prove assignment of an animal in 
your case.” 

“But I’ve passed all the tests!” 
“You have,” Dr. Wendt con- 

lllustrated by CAL

ceded wearily. “However, your 
business partner here can describe 
how you’ve affected the Institute’s 
animals. He’s been at all your ses- 
sions. Perhaps you hadn’t noticed, 
but it wasn’t at all pleasant for 
the dogs.” 

Alex Bardell took his arm solic- 
itously. “That’s true, Curt.” 

D ISMALLY, Curt remembered 
the pitiful whimpering of the 
staff animals, their yelps of pain, 
the scurrying staccato of their 
claws as they thrashed about and 
cowered in anguish. 

“Visual empathy is normally 
achieved with a delicate touch, 
scarcely felt by the Seeing-Eye 
Dog,” Wendt explained. “But oc- 
casionally there is the person with 
an unbearably rough level of 
mental impact. It’s as though 
someone were grinding into the 
animal’s brain with a rasp. Unfor- 
tunately, you’re one of those per- 
sons.” 

“But can’t I tone down?” 

“No one has been able to ap- 
preciably alter his impact index 
yet, although recent research has 
been encouraging.” 

“I can keep on trying!” 

“It isn’t that simple. Besides the 
humane consideration, there’s the 
fact that rough mental contact 
drives an animal mad. And there’s 
no telling when it may identify 
the source of its anguish and at- 
tack — viciously.” 

114 



Curt groped for the desk, found 
its edge. “But the LITE staff dogs 
stood up under the punishment. 
Can’t I have one of them?” 

“No,” Wendt said bluntly. “Each 
animal here has gone through 
years of special preparation to 
train applicants. Each is the re- 
sult of generations of nucleoni- 
cally stimulated inbreeding. In all 
other respects, though, they’re 
still just dogs. Their breaking 
point is merely higher than any 
stock animal that could be as- 
signed to you by the Labonitz In- 
stitute of Telepathic Empathy.” 
“But I’ve got to have my sight 
before next week!” Curt insisted. 
“I have to know by then whether^ 
I can live a normal life with a 
Seeing-Eye Dog!” 

“I know. Your fiancee is due 
back then. How long has it been 
since your accident?” 

“Two months.” Curt dropped 
back into his chair. 

“And you’re organically blind?” 
“Hopelessly blind.” 

“You’ve been in darkness now 
for sixty days with a permanent 
optic nerve lesion.” Wendt’s voice 
was coldly impersonal. “Mr. 
Markson, I was sightless forty 
years before Dr. Labonitz per- 
fected the VE technique.” 

Animal nails clattered on the 
tile floor and suddenly a dog’s 
breath panted in Curt’s face as 
two forepaws plopped down on 
his leg. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Wendt had sent his “eyes” up 
for a closer look. 

L IKE the buzzing of a horde of 
insects, rubber droned monot- 
onously on concrete as Curt tried 
to visualize the rush of summer 
green past the car. 

“Don’t take me back to the 
office, Alex,” he said despondently. 
“I’m not much use there.” 

Alex laughed. “Of course you 
are. As soon as you readjust, you’ll 
be contributing as much as be- 
fore.” 

Curt was depressively silent. 
Then, “It’s no good. I’m going to 
pull out of the business— get away 
entirely.” 

Alex jolted the car to a stop. 
“Don’t you realize I want you to 
share the firm? I still can’t help 
feeling responsible for the acci- 
dent.” 

“Forget it. The only reason the 
company plane crashed was be- 
cause I didn’t make sure I had 
enough gas.” 

“But I told you I’d have the 
gauge fixed and see that the tank 
was full.” 

“You couldn’t — you had car 
trouble and there was no way to 
send word before I took off.” 
Alex drove on silently and Curt 
played a spiritless game of trying 
to identify the sounds that came 
to him in the eternal night. 

“Alex, I don’t want you to think 
I don’t appreciate everything. 

SEEING-EYE DOG 



You’ve been like a brother. Even 
in the matter of Sue — ” 

“There was nothing magnani- 
mous in that. She loved you, not 
me.” 

Curt slumped. “That’s pretty 
much like water over the dam. 
When she gets back in town, I’m 
not even going to see her. Things 
will be different then ... if you’re 
still interested.” 

Alex exploded. “So you want 
me to rescue her? For God’s sake, 
knock off the dirge! Anyway, I’ve 
figured out—” 

“We’re not headed downtown, 
are we?” 

“No. I didn’t want to say any- 
thing until I was sure I could 
make the connections. But when 
I saw you’d be turned down by 
the Institute, I got in touch with 
a kennel owner.” 

He braked the car. Curt felt 
the wheels swerve and roll up the 
incline of his driveway. A dog 
yelped anxiously nearby and there 
was the clanking of a chain. 

“I went to this kennel yester- 
day. They carry on a black mar- 
ket operation in Seeing-Eye Dogs. 
Actually, the dogs are rejects 
from the LITE stock — some with 
a devious VE index, others — well, 
others just not docile enough to 
be trusted with a blind person.” 
Curt tensed anxiously, then 
smiled. Again hope flared in the 
frightful darkness. 

Alex helped him out of the car. 

115 



“They insist on only one thing — 
that we keep the animal muzzled.” 

Eagerly, Curt went forward to- 
ward the dog’s expectant whim- 
pering. “We’ll skip the muzzle in 
this case.” 

“But S-E dogs are hybrid mas- 
tiffs! This one weighs almost two 
hundred pounds!” 

“No muzzle,” Curt repeated ob- 
stinately. “That’s no way to gain 
an animal’s confidence.” 

“All right, then, no muzzle — 
but only if you don’t try visual 
empathy unless I’m with you.” 

r*0 RUTUS ” Curt called the 
animal facetiously during a 
moment of buoyant optimism as 
he spent the rest of the day and 
the next morning winning the 
mastiff’s trust. 

And the name, Curt realized as 
he knelt beside the Seeing-Eye 
Dog in the living room and sent 
his sensitive fingers over its pow- 
erful flank, was indeed appro- 
priate. 

Brutus was huge. There was 
the feel of lurking might in every 
sweeping line of its broad back 
and thickset shoulders. And in the 
great head and blunt, wrinkled 
snout — homely as they must have 
been visually — there was a tac- 
tile revelation of gentle and noble 
tolerance. 

Curt rose and the dog reared 
up, dropping its forepaws on his 
shoulders. Laughing, he staggered 

116 



back under the weight until he 
fell clumsily on the sofa. 

Alex came over and disentan- 
gled them. 

“By tomorrow,” he said en- 
couragingly, “you ought to be 
ready to try a first contact.” 

Curt tensed on the sofa. Why 
not now? There wasn’t much time 
left — Sue was due in next week 
and already it was Friday. 

Straining, he reduced his 
thought intensity to a mere whis- 
per of force, remembering the 
finer points of receptive concen- 
tration. 

Projecting an empathic connec- 
tion, Wendt had said, was like 
singling out an obscure corridor 
in the brain and imagining a 
beam of perceptive force shining 
down its length — into the primi- 
tive consciousness of the dog. 

Delicately, Curt told himself. 
In his case, the corridor must be 
a tenuous, hollow thread, pliable 
and gossamer. And the beam it- 
self had to be pale and extenu- 
ated. He added a modicum of 
intensity to the fancied ray of 
perception. 

And there was contact! 

Nothing that could be called 
vision — not yet — only the merest 
glimmer of external light. But 
that was all he wanted now. He 
must be - meticulous, allowing 
Brutus ample time for reassur- 
ance against the presence of some- 
thing alien in its mind.

SEEING-EYE DOG 



117 




The mastiff whined restlessly 
and Curt heard the heavy fall of 
its pads on the carpet as it paced. 

The perceptive thread wound 
intimately around isolated con- 
ceptual islands in the dog’s con- 
sciousness-precincts of pseudo- 
semantic thought. One prominent 
cloud of swirling concept haze 
carried the abstraction afraid. 

And Brutus’ whine climbed to 
a yelp. 

“Curt! You’re trying it?” 

He nodded. 

“Easy, then,” Alex cautioned. 
“Remember — delicately!” 

/^URT went more slowly, tarry- 
^ ing purposely among the 
shallow thought patterns. He rec- 
ognized some of the elemental 
animal ideas and discerned their 
conceptual connotation. There 
was the pre-eminent me-I of self- 
identification — the eager predi- 
cated food-stuff — the avid yearn- 
ing of the affirmative want — the 
reverential idea mist of the mys- 
tical man-thing and its, comple- 
mentary plural, more-than-one- 
man-thing. 

Boldly now, Curt bolstered the 
empathic connection, seeking out 
the animal’s visual receptor sys- 
tem. 

And there was light! 

Vaguely, he could see the out- 
line of furniture, himself standing 
in front of the dog, the sunshine 
pouring in through the window. 

118 



But the mastiffs fear was like 
a great quaking vibration and the 
precincts of concept haze swirled 
and thrashed viciously: me-I — 
afraid — man-thing — more-than- 
one-man-thing — 

Brutus reared in anguish and 
abruptly Curt’s contact with the 
animal snapped, plunging him 
back into darkness. And Curt 
could hear the dog barging and 
barking madly about the room. 

“Easy!” Alex shouted. “Break 
off!” 

Curt thrust his hands up pro- 
tectively. But suddenly the great 
animal lunged into him and sent 
him flailing backward. Somewhere 
in the room, furniture smashed 
and glass shattered. 

“What happened?” he cried. 

“The fool dog banged into a 
table. But he seems to be calming 
down now.” 

Groping, Curt went toward the 
sound of the mastiffs rasping 
breathing. 

“Stay away!” Alex warned. 
“He’s dangerous!” 

But Curt’s hands touched the 
great trembling body and he ran 
his fingers tenderly over the fur- 
rowed coat of the dog’s nape, 
whispering reassuring words. Its 
whimpers subsided eventually and 
it turned to lick his hand. 

“We’ve got to muzzle the beast,” 
Alex said resolutely. 

Curt shook his head. “This is 
bad enough.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



T HAT NIGHT, only a short 
while after Alex phoned to say 
he wouldn’t be in until late, the 
facsimile teletype’s bell signaled 
reception of a telegram while its 
keys clacked out the message. 

Curt tore the sheet out of the 
machine and held it in front of 
his eyes, before he remembered 
he couldn’t see. Bitterly, he crum- 
pled the paper and thrust it in 
his pocket. 

He felt his way to the window. 
With the breeze on his face, he 
tried to visualize the full Moon 
that would be rising in the east. 
“Brutus,” he called softly. 

The mastiffs chain dragged 
across the supporting wire until 
the animal stood close enough for 
Curt to hear its friendly, excited 
breathing. 

He toyed tentatively with the 
idea of attempting another VE 
contact, now that the distractions 
of the day were over and the dog 
was safely tethered. 

Tenderly, he sent the percep- 
tual beam through the narrow 
corridor to the animal’s mind. 

And again he encountered the 
ethereal islands of conceptual 
constructs. There was the vague 
reflection of his own image, all 
cloaked in the idea haze man- 
thing. And in symbolic nearness 
was the animal’s sphere of self- 
identity. Only now it was more 
than me-I. It had taken on a new 
shade — me-I-Brutus. 



Abruptly he realized the man- 
thing image had grown stronger 
and was swimming into resolu- 
tion. Now it seemed to be cen- 
tered in a rectangular frame, sil- 
houetted by brilliant backlighting. 

Then he recognized the frame 
as the window in which he stood. 
Without complications, he had es- 
tablished visual empathy and was 
now looking at himself through 
the eyes of the animal! 

Brutus gave a soft yelp. But 
Curt readily recognized that it 
was not a cry of distress, only 
alert expectancy. 

Good boy, Brutus! he thought. 

The subvocal praise struck re- 
sponsive idea chords in the mas- 
tiff’s mind. 

Me-I-Brutus — good took shape 
sluggishly, with a tinge of simple, 
unaffected pride. Then a new con- 
cept haze formed, clouded with 
perplexity: Boy? 

Curt remembered the telegram 
and broke the connection. Hur- 
riedly, he felt his way to the back 
door and stepped outside, re- 
establishing contact. 

Vicarious vision came instantly. 
And Curt watched himself walk 
down the steps — cautiously at 
first, then more confidently as he 
realized there was efficient coor- 
dination despite the shift to ex- 
ternal perspective. 

He struck out across the yard 
toward the dog, clearly seeing and 
avoiding the bench that was in his 



SEEING-EYE DOG 



119 



path. The mastiff started to turn 
its head aside, but Curt canceled 
the motion with a deliberately 
soft impulse. 

Standing before the animal, he 
ironed the telegram smooth 
against his thigh. Then he held 
the message in front of the dog’s 
face. 

Brutus started to sniff the pa- 
per, but with a gentle command, 
Curt stayed the action and the 
dog sat motionless, its eyes on the 
telegram. The bold type stood 
out prominently in the moonlight: 

DARLING — DOCK MONDAY 
MORNING. FLY HOME IMME- 
DIATELY. CAN’T WAIT. WOULD 
TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY 
SEEM TOO ANXIOUS? I LOVE 
YOU — SUE 

M/7TTH THE housekeeper off 
™ for the weekend, Alex fixed 
breakfast the next morning. But 
Curt showed little interest in the 
food. 

“You should have been here, 
Alex!” he said enthusiastically. “It 
worked just the way Wendt said 
it would.” 

“What do you suppose made it 
work?” 

“I don’t know, unless it was be- 
cause I tried it on the spur of the 
moment. All the other times, I 
spent hours anticipating visual 
empathy, building up a tension 
that could be released only tele- 

120 



pathically into the animals’ 
minds.” 

“That might be it,” Alex said 
thoughtfully. “At any rate, I’m 
glad we’re making progress — with 
Sue due in day after tomorrow.” 
Curt leaned forward excitedly. 
“Do you realize if she had been 
out there last night, she wouldn’t 
even have suspected I was blind?” 
“It was that good?” 

“It was remarkable. Wendt was 
right — vicarious vision is better 
than direct sight. You can see 
yourself in true objective relation- 
ship to everything around you.” 
Outside, Brutus’ chain slid nois- 
ily along its race as the mastiff 
covered its range again and again 
in a bounding, playful stride. 

Alex’s chair skittered back. “I’ve 
got to run into town and get Jack- 
son started on the Petersburg job 
specifications. When I come back, 
we’ll see what you can do.” 

After he had gone, Curt roamed 
restlessly through the blackness 
of the house, struggling not to an- 
ticipate the next attempt at estab- 
lishing visual empathy. Now he 
was sure trying too hard had been 
the cause of all his trouble. 

But as he went from room to 
room, he found his thoughts re- 
turning uncontrollably to the mas- 
tiff, his mind involuntarily trying 
to make VE contact. At the Insti- 
tute, they had told him it would 
be that way. They had said he 
would find sight contact — even 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



motor control— an automatic proc- 
ess. They had promised no more 
volition would be needed to com- 
mand the dog’s visual faculties 
than had been required for his 
own. 

He was in the hallway when 
the phone rang. Rather than re- 
run the obstacle course to the liv- 
ing room, he felt his way toward 
the extension in Alex’s room. 

His groping hand knocked 
something off the night table be- 
fore he found the phone. 

“Mr. Markson?” a girl’s voice 
inquired. 

“Yes?” 

“This is Westside Kennels,” she 
said. “Just calling to see whether 
you’re satisfied with the dog.” 

“Brutus? He’s fine.” 

“We thought you’d be pleased. 
Actually, I just wanted to make 
sure you got the animal okay. We 
don’t usually deliver them sight 
unseen and install them in the 
yard.” 

Curt felt his back tighten. Pre- 
occupied with the conversation, 
his mind had unconsciously sent 
out a perceptual thread to Brutus 
and he had gotten a vicarious 
glimpse of the yard. 

“Mr. Markson?” the girl asked. 

“Yes. Everything’s all right. The 
dog’s fine.” Deliberately, he closed 
off the involuntary contact with 
the mastiff’s mind. 

After he had hung up, he felt 
along the floor for the object he 



had knocked off the table. Almost 
immediately, he found it— a flat 
steel file. When he opened the 
drawer to place it inside, his hand 
encountered an object whose iden- 
tity escaped him at first. Curi- 
ously, he ran his fingers over the 
thing. It was a gardener’s hand 
rake. 

T HAT AFTERNOON, Brutus 
romped playfully in the living 
room, the thud of its pads re- 
sounding against the carpet like 
the beat of a drum wrapped in 
wool. 

Alex led Curt to a straight-back 
chair. 

“I think it’ll be better,” he sug- 
gested, “if you relax first, try to 
ease off all the tension.” 

“I’ve been anticipating this ses- 
sion too much,” Curt said appre- 
hensively. “Suppose it doesn’t 
work?” 

“Get your mind off it for a 
while. Think about something 
else. I’ll call the signal on estab- 
lishing VE.” 

Curt summoned a mental image 
of Sue as she had been three 
months earlier, on the day she 
sailed with her mother on the 
tour. 

Brutus quieted, padded over to 
sniff his trouser legs. But Curt 
tried to keep his thoughts off the 
dog. Recalling the accident was 
an easy way of doing that — the 
plane sputtering only minutes af- 



SEEING-EYE DOG 



121 



ter takeoff, stalling, falling away 
into the wooded section — 

“Now, Curt!” Alex said softly. 

Hesitantly, Curt gave rein to 
the eager niche of his mind that 
recoiled before the darkness. Vi- 
carious vision snapped on like a 
floodlight and the animal whined 
briefly. 

Curt saw himself seated in the 
chair. In a mirror behind him, he 
watched the dog sitting on its 
haunches and disinterestedly lick- 
ing its chops. 

Now the mastiff’s crude 
thoughts were weaving warm 
emotions of delightful fondness 
and loyalty, gratitude — monoto- 
nous in their fawning simplicity, 
yet sincere and reassuring. 

Man-thing good boy . Food- 
stuff? . I-Brutus thirst-water. 

Curt turned triumphantly to- 
ward Alex and, compliantly, the 
dog’s head swung in that direc- 
tion, centering on the other who 
stood by the door. 

Then Brutus went berserk. 

Sickening with disappointment 
and fear, Curt watched fierce 
spasms of pain rack the primitive 
processes of its mind. 

T HROUGH the mirror, he saw 
the great dog rear up, growl- 
ing savagely. Then the visual con- 
tact broke and he heard the mas- 
tiff charging in agony around the 
room and crashing into the fur- 
niture. 

122 



Alex shouted in alarm and the 
door slammed shut, muffling the 
outcry. 

Helpless before the rampaging 
brute, Curt held his contact with 
the animal’s nonperceptive con- 
sciousness, trying to soothe it. 

Easy, boy, he thought desper- 
ately. It’s all right, Brutus! 

Hurt! I-Brutus afraid! Even de- 
spite its anguish, shreds of pseudo- 
rational thought seeped through 
to Curt. Man-thing, other-man- 
thing, man-thing, other-man-thing. 

Brutus was trying to identify 
the source of its distress! 

Curt rose and stumbled around 
behind the chair, putting it be- 
tween himself and the crazed ani- 
mal that raged in the impenetra- 
ble darkness. 

The ponderous wheeling weight 
lurched against the chair and the 
impact hurled him to the floor. 
Then there was the sound of 
angry teeth crunching into wood, 
splintering the chair, scattering it 
about the room. 

“Alex!” he called frantically. 

The door opened and the dog 
flung the chair aside and rushed 
growling across the room. 

Alex screamed in pain. Then 
there was silence as Curt traced 
Brutus’ racing claws down the 
polished hallway floor and out the 
back door. 

“What happened? Alex! You 
all right?” 

There was movement on the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



floor by the door and Alex swore 
painfully. “Goddam monster got 
his teeth in my arm!” 

Curt reached him and felt the 
sleeve, wet with blood. 

“I went out to get my automa- 
tic,” Alex explained. “But it 
wasn’t loaded. There wasn’t time 
to look for bullets.” 

“I’ll call a doctor.” 

“It isn’t that bad. I can drive 
to the clinic. But leave that 
damned animal alone!” 

S UNDAY AFTERNOON, Curt 
stood disconsolately in the 
doorway while Alex cleaned up 
the shambles the dog had made 
of the living room. 

Curt traced the other’s progress 
acoustically. “Will you drive me 
to the airport in the morning?” 
Alex was silent a moment 
“You’ve decided to meet Sue any- 
way?” 

“No. I’m taking a plane out be- 
fore she arrives.” 

“You’re not giving up that 
easily!” 

“But what else is there?” 

“First you’re going to try this 
visual empathy thing my way. 
We’ll have one more session — in 
the garage. Brutus will be chained 
down. Then you’re going to pour 
it on with all the mental strength 
you’ve got!” 

“But 

“There are two ways of master- 
ing a stubborn animal. In this 



case, consideration and kindness 
aren’t paying off. We’ll try it the 
other way.” 

Curt shook his head. “No. I’ve 
had enough. I should have lis- 
tened to Wendt.” 

“I’m sure it will work, Curt. 
Think it over. When you decide, 
let me know. I’m going to rest up. 
This arm’s giving me hell.” 

Curt sat before the window 
throughout the afternoon, feeling 
the waning warmth of the Sun on 
his face, listening to the clanking 
of Brutus’ chain as the damp 
breezes of twilight came in to rus- 
tle the curtains. 

Then quite suddenly — just as 
the hall clock rang seven — he de- 
cided. 

He went to the phone and had 
the operator put him through to 
the owner of Westside Kennels. 

“I’m calling about a dog I got 
Thursday,” he explained when the 
man answered. “I want you to 
pick it up in the morning.” 

“I’m sorry, but we don’t make 
any adjustments — ” 

“I’m giving you back the ani- 
mal,” Curt said. 

“That’s different. Who did you 
say you were?” 

“The transaction was in the 
name of Alex Bardell.” 

There was a pause. “I don’t re- 
call that name.” 

“It’s the animal you delivered 
and put on a race in the yard.” 
“Oh, the S-E mastiff? I didn’t 



SEEING-EYE DOG 



123 



recognize your voice, Mr. Mark- 
son.” 

“That’s understandable,” Curt 
said irritably. “You haven’t heard 
it before.” 

“What do you mean? We spoke 
on the phone three times about 
the animal before you said to 
send it out.” 

Curt frowned uncertainly. Then 
he heard a click in the receiver 
and remembered the extension in 
Alex’s room. 

“You still there, Mr. Markson?’’ 

“It’s okay,” said Curt. “Thanks.” 

PENSIVELY, he replaced the 
phone in the cradle. Why, he 
wondered, had Alex arranged the 
purchase of the dog in his — Curt’s 
— name? More important, why 
had he been listening in on the 
telephone conversation? It was 
almost as though Alex had been 
trying to create the impression 
that he’d had nothing to do with 
buying Brutus. Why? Because he 
hadn’t wanted to become involved 
in a black market deal? 

Still puzzling over the click of 
the extension phone, his thoughts 
went back to the last time he had 
used the instrument in Alex’s 
room. And he remembered the file 
he had knocked off the table and 
the hand rake he had found in 
the drawer. 

He stiffened misgivingly. Now 
that he recalled the incident, 
there had been something odd 

124 



about the rake. All but three — or 
was it two? — of its prongs were 
missing. And — 

The door closed softly behind 
him and its lock clicked shut. 
Then he heard the light switch 
snap on. 

“Alex?” he called apprehen- 
sively. 

Alex laughed. “You look as 
though you’ve doped out some- 
thing rather unpleasant.” 

“Like what?” Curt asked, be- 
fuddled. 

“I was afraid you had become 
suspicious when you found the 
file on the night table yesterday. 
But then I realized that if you 
had suspected anything then, you 
would have left it on top of the 
table and not in the drawer with 
the rake.” 

The remaining prongs on the 
hand rake, Curt remembered 
now, had been sharpened — like 
the fangs of a dog! 

“But after hearing that phone 
conversation,” Alex went on, “I 
knew it would take someone with 
a lot less sense not to have figured 
out everything then.” 

“The rake!” Curt blurted. 
“Brutus!” 

“Brutus? I was hoping there 
would be another session with the 
dog. I was going to let him work 
you over, then finish the job with 
the rake. But since you forced the 
issue, I’ll have to lock him up in 
here and let him supply all the evi- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



dence I’m going to need.” 

“I don’t think he’ll attack me.” 

“Oh, but he will,” Alex said. “I 
can pour enough pain and confu- 
sion into his mind to make him 
tear the whole house up. You see, 
I had a lot of practice with em- 
pathy and control when I at- 
tended the sessions with you at 
the Institute.” 

“You were driving Brutus mad!” 

“Of course. In fact, I’m the rea- 
son you were rejected by LITE. 
You’re probably as efficient a VE 
contact controller as the next guy. 
But I couldn’t let it be that way. 
Because then you’d learn that 
with an S-E dog, blindness 
wouldn’t be any obstacle at all 
between you and Sue. So I was 
always there to agitate the dogs 
and make sure you’d be rejected; 
to engineer a deal so it would ap- 
pear that you yourself bought a 
dangerous black market animal; 
to keep enraging Brutus telepa- 
thically — ” 

/^URT lunged for the phone. 
^ But Alex’s fist exploded 
against his face and he dropped 
to the floor. Water sour with the 
smell of stale flowers spilled into 
his face and a hand pulled him 
roughly to his feet. 

“Even letting you get by with 
that successful session with the 
dog Friday night fitted in well 
with my plans,” Alex went on 
softly. “It gave you confidence so 



you’d be encouraged to continue 
your attempts at VE.” 

Curt sent eyes that couldn’t see 
darting about the room and Alex 
laughed at his desperation. 

“Even this gash on my arm is 
a bit of luck. If I have to, I can 
show the dog was just as much a 
threat to me as it was to you.” 
“They’ll wonder why you didn’t 
help me when the dog attacked,” 
Curt pointed out. 

“Not a chance. You see, I left 
for Cleveland this morning on the 
two-fifteen. Several persons saw 
me buy a ticket and get on the 
train. But I made certain they 
didn’t see me get off before it left. 
Others will see me return tomor- 
row morning. In between depar- 
ture and arrival, I haven’t left 
the house and the car’s hidden in 
the garage. I think I’ll even go to 
a hotel when I get in tomorrow 
and let the housekeeper find the 
mess here.” 

Curt stood frozen against the 
wall, wrestling helplessly with his 
thoughts. But what chance did he 
have — blind? Outside, Brutus 
yawned audibly and stirred inside 
the kennel next to the house. 

“But you know something, 
Curt? I don’t think there’ll even 
be an investigation. What hap- 
pened will be clear enough.” 

Curt listened helplessly to the 
approaching footsteps. 

“Was it Sue?” he asked. 

He imagined he could see Alex’s 



SEEIN6-EYE DOG

characteristic shrug. “Sue and the 
business, of course. You didn’t 
think I would let you have her 
so easily, did you? And with the 
arrangement we have, this is the 
only way I can own the firm out- 
right.” 

“The crash, too, Alex?” 

TT E tried to hide the hope on 
his face as he suddenly sent 
a thread of perceptive empathy 
to Brutus’ brain. A nocturnal 
scene of the yard formed sharply 
in his mind, framed in the arched 
entrance to the dog house. 

“Naturally the crash, too,” said 
Alex. “That seemed like the sim- 
plest way. After it failed, though, 
I couldn’t try anything like that 
again. But when you started your 
sessions at LITE, I saw what 
could be done.” 

Gingerly, Curt made the animal 
rise and step out of the kennel 
without noise. But Brutus’ inces- 
sant low-level thoughts seemed to 
blare deafeningly. 

I-Brutus good boy. Man-thing— 
Curt snipped them off, leaving 
only the visual empathy corridor. 
Carefully, he directed the mastiff 
toward the house. But even if he 
could find some way to release 
the dog and bring it crashing 
through the window, what good 
would it do? Alex was still there 
to drive it into a frenzy. 

Curt tried another desperate 
play for time. “But why didn’t you 

126 



let me pull out? I wanted to.” 

He brought the dog into a ram- 
pant attitude, straining upright at 
the end of its taut chain — but 
silently. 

“Pull out?” Alex said. ‘Tm not 
that naive. Let you decide later 
to have another try at the Insti- 
tute and find out you could get 
along with an S-E animal?” 

Swiftly but cautiously, Curt sent 
the animal prancing sideways un- 
til its head was lined up with the 
window. Now he could see vicari- 
ously into the room! 

Alex was in front of him, the 
rake with its sharpened prongs 
drawn back and aimed at his 
neck. Alex swung the tool and 
Curt ducked, straightening with 
an uppercut that couldn’t have 
been better directed even if he 
had coordinated it from the auto- 
perspective. 

He left Alex limp on the floor 
and groped his way out of the 
house to Brutus. 

“Come on, boy,” he said, un- 
chaining the animal. “Let’s get 
out before he comes to and starts 
throwing monkey-thoughts into 
the works.” 

Man-thing good boy, Brutus 
prated as Curt ushered the dog 
onto the car seat beside him and 
drove off. Other-man-thing bad. 

A T THE airport, Brutus trailed 
dutifully behind them as Curt 
carried Sue’s bags toward the car. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He had kept the dog at a distance 
so she wouldn’t suspect yet. 

Ahead, Sue’s mother obligingly 
stepped into the cab Curt had or- 
dered for her. 

His perspective was a view of 
their own backs, with the expanse 
of the airport and its passenger 
aisles stretching out before them. 

Curt held her hand more 
tightly. “Watch out for that crack 
in the apron,” he warned. 

She laughed lightly and drew 
up, turning toward him. Puzzled, 
he sat Brutus on his haunches and 
directed the animal’s gaze on her 
attractive profile while he guided 
his own sightless stare full into 
her face. 

“All right, Curt,” she said cheer- 
fully. “I’m convinced. You can 
call off the demonstration.” 



Stunned, he backed off. “You 
knew?” 

“Of course. Alex kept me in- 
formed. He wasn’t at all optimis- 
tic about it, though. He was sure 
you wouldn’t qualify at LITE. 
But I knew you would.” 

He let the breath rush out of 
his lungs. “Then why didn’t you 
tell me you knew?” 

“Because I wanted you to see 
that blindness would make no dif- 
ference between us.” 

Blithely, she kissed him on the 
cheek, then turned toward Brutus. 
“So that’s the mutt? Come here, 
boy. We’ve got to start getting 
acquainted.” 

Curt let her drive to town while 
he sat back enjoying the scenery 
— and her.

M AcPHERSON shuffled 
the cards over and over 
again. His hands were 
almost steady. 

“Want to place a limit on the 
bets?” he asked. 

His two colleagues who had 
made the night drive with him 
from the University said nothing, 
but Rothman laughed. 

“Today?” he said. “Today, the 
sky’s the limit.” 

MacPherson rested the deck on 
the table and watched as Roth- 
man stood up to look through the 
barred window at the glittering 
Arizona desert. Rothman had got 
thinner during his months of con- 
finement; his shoulders were bony 
beneath the gray hospital robe 
and his balding head looked like 
a skull. 

“Are you going to play?” asked 
MacPherson. “Or is poker too 
childish an amusement for a ma- 
thematician?” 

Rothman turned his back to 
the window. “Oh, I’ll play. When 
three old friends from the Project 
suddenly turn up for a visit, even 
a madman will string along.” 
Shuffling the cards again, Mac-

would say something; it wasn’t

the conversation. Professor Avery, 
who had cut his physics classes in 
order to join the morning’s party, 
sat in glum silence. His plump 
face was pale, and behind thick- 
lensed spectacles which enlarged 
his eyes grotesquely, he blinked 
as he watched the flickering cards. 
Dr. Neill, from Physical Chemis- 
try, was tapping his toe against 
the table leg, watching Rothman, 
who stood at the window, waiting. 

“But we can’t have much of a 
game with only four people,” said 
Rothman. “We ought to have a 
fifth.” 

“Maybe we can find someone.” 
MacPherson walked to the locked 
steel door and rattled the rectan- 
gular lattice set in at shoulder 
height, put his mouth to the metal 
bars and called out. 

“Hey, Joe!” 

A N attendant in white uniform 
shuffled into the corridor of 
closed doors, carrying a tray with 
one hand and scratching his head 
with the other. 

“How about joining us for a 
game of poker?” 

Joe shook his head and grinned. 
“Not me, Professor! I start buddy- 
ing around with the loonies, I lose 
my job.” 

“But we’re not inmates!” 
“Maybe not, but Dr. Rothman 
is.” 

“Doesn’t prove I’m crazy, Joe,” 
said Rothman. “Conversely, not 



being inmates doesn’t prove these 
men are sane.” 

“It’s a fact you don’t look any 
crazier to me than a lot of profes- 
sors,” confessed Joe. “I don’t 
know. All I know is, I’m not crazy 
enough to break the rules and 
lose my job. Besides, you long- 
hairs wouldn’t stand a chance at 
poker with me.” 

Still grinning, he shuffled out of 
sight down the hall. 

MacPherson sighed and went 
back to the table. “Well, we’ll 
have to get along with just the 
four of us.” 

“There’s always the unseen 
guest,” said Rothman, “but you 
won’t need to deal him a hand. He 
already holds all the cards.” 

Neill looked up. “Stop ham- 
ming and sit down. Quit making 
like a maniac. It’s not even a good 
act.” 

“Okay.” Rothman drew up a 
chair. “Now what was said about 
limiting the bets?” 

“Why bother setting a limit?” 
said Neill. “We’re not likely to 
mistake each other for million- 
aires and we all got exactly the 
same pay when we were on the 
Project. Unless your sick pay has 
had two or three zeros tacked 
onto it, you’re npt going to be 
making any wild bets, and as for 
the rest of us — ” 

“University professors are still 
being paid less than nightclub 
dancers,” said Avery. “You’re 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



lucky to be out of the rat race, 
Rothman. While we worry about 
how to pay the grocery bill, you 
can relax, eating and sleeping at 
government expense. You never 
had it so good.” 

“Maybe you’d like to get your- 
selves committed and keep me 
company?” 

MacPherson rapped the deck 
on the table. “Stop that kind of 
talk. We came here to play poker.” 

“Did you?” asked Rothman, 
grinning. “Then why don’t you 
deal?” 

“Cut, Neill?” said MacPherson. 
As he shot the slippery cards over 
the table top, each flick of his 
thumb watched by Rothman’s in- 
tent eyes, he regretted this impul- 
sive visit; it now seemed a gesture 
without meaning. He wondered 
whether the others were as nerv- 
ous as he was. 

On the drive over from Los 
Angeles during the night, Neill 
had seemed calm enough and 
even Avery, who had changed a 
lot during work on the Project, 
had chatted with them uncon- 
strainedly. It was hard to be cer- 
tain what other men were feeling, 
even when you had known them 
a long time, but it could not be 
pleasant for any of them to be 
visiting a former colleague who 
had been removed from the Proj- 
ect directly to a sanitarium. 

“Tell me something,” said Roth- 
man as he picked up his cards. 



“Do you still think I’m crazy?” 
“Don’t be an idiot,” MacPher- 
son snapped. “Do you think we’d 
cut our classes and drive nearly 
five hundred miles just to play 
poker with a lunatic?” 

“No,” said Rothman. “That’s 
how I know. But why aren’t you 
frank about it? Why keep on pre- 
tending there wasn’t a special 
reason for your visit?” 

N EILL was beating his foot 
against the table leg again 
and Avery’s eyes were hard and 
staring as he examined his cards. 

‘Who’ll open?” MacPherson 
asked. “I can’t.” 

“I can,” said Rothman. “I’m bet- 
ting one blue chip. Listen, Avery, 
why won’t you look at me? If you 
think I’m hamming, what do you 
call your own act? How long are 
we going to go on kidding each 
other? They’ve shut me up here, 
but that doesn’t mean they’ve 
stopped me from logical thinking. 
My three old friends from the 
Project don’t turn up in the mid- 
dle of a Friday morning just to 
calm my fevered brain with a 
card game.” 

“What’s wrong with poker?” 
demanded MacPherson. 

“Poker? Nothing. I know — It 
must be the test. Total conversion 
of matter to energy. Not just a 
minute percentage any more — 
total conversion. They’ve finished 
the set, haven’t they? They’re

131 



ready to test. They’re going to 
disintegrate Waaku, aren’t they? 
It must be today. Then this is the 
day the world ends. Tell me, 
when is zero hour?” 

Neill’s cards had slipped from 
his fingers and he stooped to the 
floor, fumbling for them. Avery 
was bending one corner of a card, 
creasing it, smoothing it out, and 
creasing it again. Nobody was go- 
ing to answer, MacPherson real- 
ized. They were leaving it up to 
him. 

He spoke sharply. “You’re get- 
ting onto forbidden ground, Roth- 
man. You know we’re not allowed 
to discuss the Project with you. 
We’re allowed to visit you only 
under the strictest promise not to 
speak of it at all. You’re certainly 
rational enough to understand 
what the therapists have told you, 
that you’d get well easily enough 
if you’d stop worrying. Forget 
about zero hour. Everything’s go- 
ing to be all right.” 

Rothman turned to look out the 
window. “Is it today?” 

“How should we know? We’re 
only innocent bystanders now, 
like you. Remember, we all left 
the Project over six months ago, 
except Avery, and last month 
they let him go.” 

Neill had rearranged his cards 
now and he looked at them in- 
stead of Rothman as he spoke. 
“There’s nothing to worry about. 
Your calculations were wrong. 

132 



The test is not going to get out 
of control — if and when they 
make it. But they don’t tell us 
things any more.” 

“Since they fired you,” said 
Rothman. 

“That’s right, since they fired 
us,” Neill said. The creased comer 
of a card suddenly broke off in 
his fingers. 

“If you didn’t believe in my cal- 
culations, why did you back me 
up? I didn’t ask you to. If you 
didn’t believe in the danger, why 
didn’t you stay out of the argu- 
ment and keep your jobs? It 
wasn’t your fight. You could have 
kept out of it — or attacked me, 
like Avery.” 

“All we did was insist that even 
if you had made a mistake in 
your calculations, that didn’t nec- 
essarily prove you were crazy,” 
said Neill. “We didn’t know 
whether you were right or not. 
We couldn’t argue about the 
math. Avery tore that to pieces 
and the boys at Columbia and 
Harvard backed him up. Mac- 
Pherson and I aren’t competent 
to check your math. To us, you 
didn’t seem any crazier than the 
people who sent you here. But 
after you’d scared them silly, they 
had to do something to stop your 
scaring other people.” 

TTE turned to pick up his cards 
again, but stopped at the 
sight of Avery. Avery was stand- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing and crumpling a card spas- 
modically, his lips were moving 
without sound, and he was breath- 
ing rapidly. 

“Look here,” said MacPherson. 
“You’d better change the subject. 
If little Joe passes by the door 
and hears us talking about the 
Project, he’ll have our visiting 
privileges revoked before you can 
say nuclear fission, and they’ll 
stay revoked forever.” 

“How long is forever?” asked 
Rothman, 

Avery threw down his cards 
and walked to the window. 
Through the bars, there was noth- 
ing to be seen but the expanse of 
sand, glinting in the morning sun, 
and a cactus plant casting a 
stubby shadow. He whirled to 
face the others. 

“Look, MacPherson,” he burst 
out. “I’m fed up with this game. 
Snookums Rothman mustn’t think 
about the Project any more, so 
we mustn’t say the naughty word. 
But we were all in it together at 
the beginning and there was a 
while when we were all every bit 
as scared as he was. Why not tell 
him we came this morning in case 
— just in case — he’d heard about 
the test and was worrying? What’s 
the harm in telling him what the 
whole university knows? That 
zero hour is today, this morning, 
now!” 

“Shut up, you fool!” said Mac- 
Pherson. 



But Rothman glanced at his 
cards again, then looked up. 
“When does it begin? What time 
is it now?” 

“Don’t answer!” shouted Mac- 
Pherson. “Are you trying to knock 
him off balance again?” 

“I will answer!” said Avery. 
“I’m going to tell him. He scared 
us silly with his calculations; now 
let us scare him with some cold 
facts. It’ll do him good. Maybe 
when the test is over, if he finds — 
I mean when he finds — he was 
wrong, he’ll be cured.” 

“Yes, and maybe he’ll really be 
crazy.” 

Grabbing Avery fiercely by the 
arm, MacPherson tried to drag 
him to the door, but Avery broke 
away. 

“Listen, Rothman!” Avery’s 
breath was coming quick and 
shallow. “Today is the day! Zero 
hour is eleven o’clock this morn- 
ing!” 

M ACPHERSON sagged. No 
one spoke or moved as they 
all watched Rothman. 

At last Rothman sighed, once. 
“What time is it now?” 

From the door came a scratch- 
ing sound. MacPherson turned to 
see Joe, grinning at them through 
the steel lattice. 

“How’s things?” Joe wanted to 
know. “Thought I heard a com- 
motion in here. Doc Rothman’s 
not acting up, I hope?” 



CHAIN REACTION 



133 




“Everything’s under control, 
Joe,” MacPherson assured him. 
“Just having a friendly game.” 
“Don’t cheat while they’re 
watching you,” said Joe, and his 
face disappeared. 

“Well, the murder’s out,” said 
MacPherson. 

“No use kidding you any 
longer,” Neill said, fanning his 

134 



cards. “Eleven o’clock this morn- 
ing. Six o’clock tomorrow morning, 
Waaku time. But it’s just another 
test. Nothing’s going to happen.” 
Avery took off his glasses and 
began to polish the lenses. “Any 
idea of a possible chain reaction 
is ridiculous. As a matter of fact, 
I recently spent a full week check- 
ing the math again myself, so I 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




know. But we knew how you felt 
about it, Rothman, and we didn’t 
want you to be worrying here all 
alone, in case you’d found out. 
That’s why we came.” 

Rothman was looking out the 
window. He did not answer. 
Slowly MacPherson went back to 
his chair and picked up his cards. 
“And now how about playing some 



poker? Rothman, you opened for 
a blue. What about you, Neill?” 
“I’m staying,” said Neill, shov- 
ing in a chip. “Always was a 
gambler. I’m going to stay till the 
cows come home.” 

“What time is it?” Rothman 
asked. “I haven’t got a wristwatch. 
They think I might break the 
crystal and cut my throat.” 

MacPherson slammed down his 
cards and jerked his watch from 
his pocket. “What does it matter 
what time it is? Why couldn’t 
they give you a watch with a plas- 
tic crystal? If you have to know, 
it’s eleven-forty.” 

“And thirteen seconds,” added 
Neill. 

“Then it’s already started,” said 
Rothman. 

H E leaned his head against the 
back of his chair and closed 
his eyes. “It’s on its way now. 
There’s somewhat more than a 
third of the Earth between us and 
Waaku — the place where Waaku 
was, I mean. The disintegration 
wave is moving slowly. The seis- 
mic wave of an earthquake would 
get here in about fifty minutes, 
more or less. But the shock wave 
from Waaku, traveling somewhere 
around five thousand miles an 
hour, will need about an hour and 
seventeen minutes, plus or minus 
a minute or so. That means it will 
reach us in about thirty-seven 
minutes from now, and the disin- 



CHAIN REACTION 



135 



tegration wave is following close 
behind. Well, nice to have known 
you, fellows. Anyone want to 
check my math?” 

He waved toward the desk be- 
hind him, piled high with manu- 
script and a sprawling heap of 
books on which rested a slide-rule. 

“Calm down,” said MacPher- 
son. “Nothing is going to happen. 
Damn you, Avery! Are you proud 
of what you accomplished?” 

Avery glared. “It’ll do him 
good! He’s got to learn to face 
reality, like the rest of us. In a 
little more than half an hour, the 
test will be finished. The world 
will still be here. Rothman will 
have to admit his equations were 
wrong — and then he’ll be cured.” 
Rothman leaned forward. “Or 
contrariwise, Rothman will not 
have to admit he was wrong and 
Rothman will not be cured! If I 
made a mistake in my math, why 
couldn’t anybody put his finger 
on it? I’m not so crazy that I 
wouldn’t be able to see an error 
in calculus when it was pointed 
out to me. If you’re sure my cal- 
culations are wrong, why do you 
look so frightened?” 

“Do we have to go over all that 
again?” said MacPherson. “The 
boys at Columbia told you where 
the mistake was. It’s where you 
inverted that twelve-by-twelve 
matrix. Didn’t you bother to check 
the inverted matrix?” 

“The same old tale.” Rothman 



picked up his cards. “No mathe- 
matician will ever admit that an- 
other mathematician could invent 
a method beyond his comprehen- 
sion. Still harping on an error in 
my inverted matrix. What time is 
it now?” 

“There’s no doubt that your 
calculations are wrong,” said 
Neill, “but I still don’t see why 
we have to insist on proving it 
the hard way. With bombs, why 
do we need to fool around with 
the total disintegration of matter? 
Sure, I know the new model re- 
leases a googol times the energy 
you get out of uranium fission, 
but who cares? There’s plenty of 
uranium for our needs.” 

“The trouble with uranium is 
that it doesn’t make a big enough 
bang,” said MacPherson. “People 
aren’t impressed by it any more. 
The same goes for plutonium, 
even for lithium, at least for any 
size bomb we can make. The idea 
is to show the world something so 
convincing that they’ll never even 
think of a war again. When they 
see every island in the Waaku 
chain wiped off the map, they’ll 
get the point.” 

A VERY creased another card 
and cleared his throat. “Did 
you check the inverted twelve-by- 
twelve, Rothman?” 

“I suppose you think I forgot 
to. Have you checked it?” 

“Yes, I have. I may not know 



136 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



much math, but I did check it." 

“Even after the Columbia boys 
said it was nonsense? Well, does 
it come out right?” 

“No, it doesn’t! You multiply 
the inverted matrix by the origi- 
nal and you not only don’t get 
zeros for all elements outside the 
diagonal, you get a haphazard as- 
sortment of ones and twos. Worse 
still, every element in the diago- 
nal comes out equal to zero. The 
product of the two matrices is 
about as different from the iden- 
tity matrix as anything could be. 
You’re one of our most brilliant 
mathematicians — how could you 
manage to make so many mis- 
takes in one set of calculations?” 

“Did I tell you that was an in- 
verted matrix? Maybe, for this 
problem, you need something a 
little more advanced than alge- 
bra. Anyhow, if my math is all 
wrong, why did your first report 
okay it?” 

“What do you mean, my first 
report?” 

“The one you sent to Prexy. 
The one you later called in and 
burned. Except Prexy showed it 
to me and I photostated it. Here.” 
Rothman reached into the pile of 
papers on his desk and drew out 
a little envelope. It contained 
photographic prints. He held one 
before Avery’s glasses. “Does that 
look familiar?” 

Avery drew his hand across his 
forehead, but did not reply. 



“Is that true, Avery?” asked 
MacPherson. “Did you make a 
report okaying Rothman’s calcu- 
lations and then withdraw it?” 

“Well, what if I did? The re- 
port didn’t seem to make me 
much more popular than Roth- 
man was. What if some very in- 
fluential people in Government 
explained to Prexy, and he ex- 
plained to me, just how unpopular 
that first report might make me? 
Or suppose they didn’t. Maybe I 
simply didn’t find the mistakes in 
the math until later.” Avery kept 
looking at his cards as he spoke. 

“Oh, great,” said MacPherson. 
“Rothman gets put away here, 
Neill and I lose our jobs, and 
there’s hell to pay in Washing- 
ton, all because Avery says Roth- 
man’s math is full of holes. Now it 
turns out he wasn’t sure and 
maybe was pressured into it. 
Grand. Between a screwball and 
a skunk, I’ll choose the screwball. 
Maybe if Avery had stuck to his 
guns, there wouldn’t have been 
any test.” 

IT doesn’t matter,” said Roth- 

-*• man. “Avery was probably 
warned to mend his ways. I was. 
Or maybe he couldn’t face the 
truth. I’m sure he’s been much 
happier, the last few months, be- 
lieving I’m crazy. Anyway, I don’t 
blame him any more. Maybe my 
math will soon speak for itself. 
For your benefit—” he turned to 



CHAIN REACTION

Avery —“I may point out that the 
errors you said you found affect 
only the velocity of the wave of 
disintegration. So what if that 
isn’t quite right? The proof that 
the reaction will be self-sustaining 
is independent of that.” 

Avery was white with rage. 
“The proof, as you called it, that 
the reaction will be self-sustaining 
and will consume the entire sub- 
stance of the Earth doesn’t make 
sense, either. You used D as an 
operator where it should have 
been a constant. That’s what fi- 
nally made them certain that you 
were insane.” 

There was a rap at the door 
and Joe poked his head in. 
“Lunch, Professors! Twelve 
o’clock, high noon, like they say. 
How about some turkey sand- 
wiches?” 

MacPherson began to sweat; 
the thought of food made him feel 
sick. 

Was it possible, he wondered, 
that in spite of everything, he was 
not quite sure? He looked at Neill 
and Avery, but they had turned 
their heads away. 

“We won’t bother with lunch, 
Joe,” said Rothman. 

“Must be a pretty good game if 
you won’t even knock off to eat,” 
said Joe. “Well, will you at least 
mark your menu for tomorrow?” 

“For tomorrow? Tomorrow isn’t 
going to come, you know.” 

“Nuts,” muttered Joe as he 



closed and locked the door. “Pure 
nuts.” 

Avery cleared his throat, and 
his voice was thin. “Look here, 
Rothman! If the Universe were 
composed of matter as unstable as 
you claim, it would have ceased 
to exist long ago. Somewhere, 
somehow, in the infinity of chance 
events since the creation of the 
Earth, something would have oc- 
curred to start the self-sustaining 
chain reaction, and all matter 
would have been annihilated.” 
“Are you trying to prove some- 
thing to yourself?” asked Roth- 
man. “Surely you don’t equate in- 
finity with a mere four billion 
years. That’s a finite time — long 
enough for the more dangerous 
radioactives to disappear com- 
pletely, of course, but not long 
enough for all possible chance 
events to have taken place. Any- 
way, I never have asserted that 
the reaction would reach from 
Earth to the other planets, or 
even to the Moon. The Universe, 
including the Solar System, will 
still go on. But our old Earth is 
going up like a pile of magnesium 
powder mixed with potassium 
chlorate when you drop a lighted 
match on it.” 

A VERY wiped his forehead. “I 
don’t know why I keep argu- 
ing with a lunatic. But you know 
yourself that the value you give 
for the integration constant in 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



those equations is a pure guess, 
only you spend ten pages of dou- 
bletalk trying to hide that fact. If 
the constant is the one you give, 
why, sure, then you get a chain 
reaction. But you made it up! 
Who ever heard of a constant of 
that magnitude in the solution of 
an ordinary differential equation?” 

“That’s one criticism of my 
work the Harvard and Columbia 
boys never mentioned.” 

“Okay, then I mention it. You’re 
crazy!” 

“Are you sure?” 

“Positive!” 

“Then why can’t you forget the 
approach of zero hour? Fll tell 
you why and you aren’t even 
making a good show of hiding it. 
You know that, compared to 
mine, your knowledge of mathe- 
matics is about m a level with 
that of a college sophomore. Deep 
down, you know that my calcula- 
tions were correct. You are con- 
vinced — convinced — that the 
bombing of Waaku has already 
started a chain reaction. And that 
about seventeen minutes past 
twelve, around eight minutes from 
now, the shock wave will reach 
us, and then the wave of disinte- 
gration. Look out of the window! 
See that cactus in the sand, with 
its little yellow flower? It will be 
annihilated. All that desert will 
go, too— every pebble, every grain 
of sand. Everything you see, and 
you yourself, will be disintegrated. 



transformed into energy!” 

Suddenly he relaxed into a grin 
and softened his voice. “I thought 
we were playing poker. We’re 
waiting for you to bet. Why don’t 
you at least look at your cards?” 
Avery opened his mouth, then 
closed it, and picked up his hand, 
riffling the five cards. 

“Tm staying,” he said. “Here’s 
your blue and I raise you a blue.” 
Slowly the others picked up 
their hands and stared at the 
cards. MacPherson scarcely looked 
at his as he spoke. 

“I’m staying.” He picked up the 
deck. “Cards, gentlemen?” 

Rothman shook his head. “I’ll 
play these.” 

Neill took two. “I like to hold a 
kicker,” he explained. 

Avery and MacPherson drew 
three. 

“I opened,” said Rothman, “and 
I’ll bet five blue chips.” 

“See you and raise you a blue,” 
Neill said. 

“TU string along,” said Avery. 
MacPherson threw his hand in. 
“Til let you guys fight it out.” 

T HEY all looked at Rothman, 
who was studying his cards. 
“I’ll see you,” he began, and 
paused. Then he shoved all of his 
chips into the pot. “I’ll see you 
and raise you a hundred blue 
chips.” 

“Damn it, Rothman!” MacPher- 
son protested. “I know we agreed

on no limit, but if you go on play- 
ing like this, you’ll lose more 
than you can afford.” 

“I’ve already lost everything,” 
said Rothman, “and so have you. 
Don’t you know what time it is? 
In a few minutes, none of you 
will be around to try to collect. 
What time is it now?” 

Avery reached for his watch, 
then stopped. 

Rothman turned his head. 
“What’s that?” 

Nobody moved. 

A noise like the roar of a swift 



freight train rushed into the room, 
rattling the windows. The walls 
shook, the floor trembled, the 
slide-rule slid off the pile of books 
and clattered to the floor. 

They jumped to their feet and 
Avery ran to the window, clutch- 
ing at the bars. 

“Not yet,” said Rothman 
calmly. “The cactus plant will 
still be there, casting its little 
shadow. You might as well sit 
down and finish the game. That 
was only the shock wave. Have 
you forgotten that it is transmit-

ted through the Earth faster than 
the wave of disintegration? We 
still have a few minutes left. Isn’t 
anybody going to see my bet?” 
Avery lurched to the desk, 
grabbed a remnant of torn paper 
and scribbled on it 

“I’ll see you,” he yelled, “and 
raise you a hundred and twenty- 
five billion blues!” 

MacPherson walked to the win- 
dow. “Look at the sky. This is it.” 
They all jammed against his 
back, trying to see the horizon, 
waiting. Avery dropped the scrap 



of paper and covered his eyes. 

“What is there to see?” Neill 
whispered. 

“I thought— there was a flash . .” 
MacPherson’s voice trailed off, 
and he rubbed his eyes. 

“But I didn’t see anything,” said 
Neill. “There’s nothing to see.” 

A MINUTE went by. The des- 
ert remained calm, the blue 
sky was unmarked by even a 
cloud, the air was still. 

A second minute went by. 
Neill drew out his watch, looked

141 



wonderingly at the steady march 
of the second hand. Then he 
turned and stumbled into the lav- 
atory. They could hear his dry 
heaves. 

Rothman’s eyes wavered from 
MacPherson to Avery, and back 
to MacPherson, and he sighed. 

“Looks as if I was wrong, gen- 
tlemen,” he said. “Maybe I am 
crazy, after all. I wonder if that 
integration constant could have 
been wrong.” He reached down to 
the floor to pick up the fallen 
slide-rule, sat down and drew a 
pad of paper toward him. 

MacPherson leaned against the 
window, too weak to move. He 
saw Avery take his hands away 
from his eyes. He could hear the 
chattering of Avery’s teeth, could 
hear them click as he clamped 
them together, trying to control 
his lips. It seemed a long time be- 
fore Avery managed to speak. 

“You!” cried Avery. He lunged 
forward, grabbed Rothman by the 
shoulder and jerked him to his 
feet. “This — will teach you — not 
to make — mistakes — ” 

He smashed his fist into Roth- 
man’s face. 

Still MacPherson could not 
move, could not even shout. He 
could only listen to Avery. 

“And this will teach you — not 
to set up matrices — that don’t 
multiply — that burn up — the 
world -” 

Again Avery struck and knocked 

M2 



Rothman to the floor. 

Breaking through his paralysis, 
MacPherson clutched Avery by 
the shoulder, but Avery kicked at 
the man on the floor, again and 
again. 

“Avery!” shouted MacPherson. 
“Snap out of it, man! It’s all over! 
The test is finished. We’re still 
here. Rothman was wrong, just as 
we always knew he was!” 

But Avery was on his knees, 
pounding Rothman with both fists, 
sobbing out meaningless words, 
oblivious to the shouts outside 
and to MacPherson’s tugging. 

The door burst open and Joe 
rushed in, followed by two other 
attendants. 

“What goes on?” After a glance 
at Avery’s contorted face, Joe 
grabbed for his legs. “Send for the 
doc, boys. We’re going to need 
help.” 

O NE of the men ran down the 
corridor while Joe and the 
others succeeded in pulling Avery 
away from Rothman, who strug- 
gled to his feet. A doctor came in 
with a loaded hypodermic. He 
gave Avery an injection in the 
arm. 

“Go easy there,” said MacPher- 
son. “Hell be all right in a few 
minutes. He’s had a shock, that’s 
all.” 

“Shock,” Avery mumbled. 
MacPherson gripped Avery’s 
arm. “Try to relax, man. It’s fin-

ished. We never believed in it, of 
course. But I’ll admit it’s a relief, 
even to me, to be sure there was 
no danger of a chain reaction at 
all.” 

Suddenly he felt cold. 

There was no understanding in 
Avery’s eyes. He slumped to the 
floor. 

“Do you think he’ll be all right 
when he comes out from under 
the drug?” asked MacPherson. 

“I can’t say,” said the doctor. 



“I only saw him a few minutes, 
when you came here this morn- 
ing. I thought at the time he was 
pretty disturbed. Much more than 
Rothman here. Next week, I 
think, we’re going to send Roth- 
man home.” 

Rothman wiped the blood off 
his chin and grinned weakly. “You 
don’t mean that, Doc. I used the 
wrong integration constant in a 
little calculation. I must be crazy.”

FORECAST 

Next month's big news helps to establish 1956 as a truly great 
science fiction year, with Alfred Bester's THE STARS MY DESTINATION 
proving that a magnificept talent can grow beyond even so spectacu- 
lar a story as Bester's own The Demolished Man. In that earlier novel, 
he hauled you into a moving, breathing, living world based on tele- 
pathy. Now he puts you in an even more alive world based on tele- 
portation . but teleportation so dramatically explicit that you'll feel 
you can follow the method without the slightest trouble and never 
use any other form of transportation again! Just as the telepathic 
society shaped the unforgettable characters of The Demolished Man, 
the teleportation society of THE STARS MY DESTINATION produces 
people in its own startling shape . including Gully Foyle, ship- 
wrecked spaceman with the most frightening grudge the Solar Sys- 
tem has ever known! 

Here, indeed, is a serial that joins a brilliant company of science 
fiction masterpieces. 

Why take a chance on missing it? Reserve your copy at your 
newsstand or subscribe today. If you don't, you'll be missing a genu- 
inely memorable reading experience!
