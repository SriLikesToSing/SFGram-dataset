CHANCE & MAPS 



^"hN the wall of a tavern in mid- 
^ town New York is a sign 
that advises customers: “In Case 
of Atomic Raid, Stand Near the 
Cuspidor — Nobody Has Hit It 
Yet!” 

It’s meant as a sarcastic gag, 
of course, but in it is the sort of 
cockeyed logic to be found in 
cloud chambers and history 
books. It’s perfectly possible that 
somebody, beerily obeying the 
wry advice, may save his life 
while everybody around him is 
fried with mushroom explosions. 

The number of disasters that 
humanity and individuals have 
stumbled into through blind, 
freak accident is appalling. Many 
of them are among the most im- 
portant entries in the history of 
our race. 

But . how many disasters 
have humanity and individuals 
avoided through other blind, 
freak accidents? The wars that 
might have happened and didn’t; 
the inventions, like Hero’s steam 
reaction engine, made prema- 
turely, that could have wrecked 
civilizations unready for them, 
but, by pure great luck, were un- 
recognized for what they were; 
the missed trains and planes that 
crashed; the potential Napoleons 
thwarted because they came on- 
stage at the wrong moment . 

It’s an endless list and one that 



fortunately can never be verified. 
Neither, of course, can the hap- 
penstances that cost us discov- 
eries, masterpieces, the births or 
the lives of geniuses and good 
ordinary people — and eras of 
peace where there was none, but 
might have been. 

During the early days of World 
War II, the government had to 
prohibit the sale of steel-clad 
Bibles, which, it was claimed, 
would turn aside bullets and 
fragments of shell. This hopeful 
business got its impetus from 
actual instances of soldiers being 
saved by plain clothbound Bibles 
carried in their pockets. 

Those were real accidents, and 
they worked. But the contrived 
ones didn’t. They turned non- 
lethal bullets into dumdums — 
which is why the sale had to be 
stopped. 

I don’t suggest that we rely on 
chance to the extent of providing 
the population with unhittable 
cuspidors instead of atomic shel- 
ters, or soldiers with clothbound 
Bibles solely to replace the very 
effective body armor developed 
for the Korean war, or that every- 
thing possible should not be done 
to avert fission warfare. 

But neither should the role of 
the unexpected and unpredict- 
able bit of freak luck be disre- 
garded — especially by science

fiction writers. One dramatic ex- 
ample is the startling effect of 
Stalin’s death. 

I’d like to do an editorial soon 
on the influence erf random fac- 
tors on both events and individu- 
als. If you have something to 
contribute to the relatively meag- 
er supply of data I have on hand, 
I’d be happy to see it. 

A T the moment, though, I’m 
bemused by a book called 
Maps and Map-Makers by R. V. 
Tooley (Crown Publishers), part- 
ly because it’s a lavishly lovely 
array of colorful ancient maps, 
but mostly because it details a 
talent that will have to be ap- 
plied to other planets, when we 
reach them. 

Studying these old maps, I’m 
struck more by their approxima- 
tions to accuracy than what 
others might consider their quaint 
notions of geography. 

There’s an astonishing ability 
shown here, the ability to convert 
land and sea masses into bird’s- 
eye views — wjjh benefit of only 
the crudest instruments and ves- 
sels. It’s the ability to visualize 
as if from the air or even space. 

Since I don’t have that talent 
for abstraction, it amazes me as 
much as levitation might. And 
yet, as Tooley remarks, “map- 
making is probably the oldest of 
the graphic arts, for it is common 
to all primitive peoples. For ex- 



ample, the Eskimos have con- 
structed maps of their own coasts 
but little inferior to Admiralty 
charts. Marshall islanders pre- 
serve a knowledge of their own 
localities by a sequence of palm 
leaves and sea shells; a native of 
Tahiti drew a map of an area 
nearly 3,000 miles in length for 
Captain Cook . 

“Cortes traveled 1,000 miles 
through Central America guided 
only by a calico map provided by 
a local cacique,” 

There are strange national 
variations in the making of maps, 
and even more so from period to 
period, that one doesn’t usually 
associate with anything so factu- 
al. Italian cartography was se- 
vere; French, light and almost 
witty; Dutch, meticulous and 
comfortable; and the bounciness 
of the Elizabethan era is a re- 
markable contrast to the solidity 
of prosperous Victorianism. 

Of course, when we reach new 
planets, we’ll have an advantage 
that the ancients lacked — actual- 
ly being able to map from outer 
space all the way down to low- 
level aerial photography and on- 
the-spot surveying. 

But even if a world is cut off 
and reverts to barbarism, the 
ability to make maps won’t be 
lost. In fact, judging by past 
history, it probably would be one 
of the first to be reborn.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



By J. T. M’INTOSH 



There was no reason for the revolt of 

the Murrane colonists against Earth 
but they had every reason to hide the fact I 



lllustrtrtsd by VIDMESt 



I 

I F she had been a man, they 
would have saved them- 
selves a lot of trouble and 
killed her. Yet they had quite a 
few reasons for doing what they 
did. 

First, the knowledge she had 
must be destroyed one way or 
another— there was no question 
of that. They couldn’t afford to 
keep her prisoner anywhere on 
Murrane, so it was either death 
or this. Another reason was that 
they had a new technique and 
this was a chance to try it out. 
Another was that they liked the 
idea of being able to let her go, 
even return her to her own 
world, and nevertheless know 
that she was no danger to them. 



ALONE 



Another, perhaps, was that 
should it ever become necessary, 
they could reveal that they hadn't 
killed her after all. 

But behind all this was the 
fact that they were Murriners. 
Women, on the frontiers of galac- 
tic exploration, were almost sa- 
cred. The whole attitude toward 
women was different from that 
on an overcrowded world with 
as many women as men. All this 
was irrelevant in this particular 
case; but, being Murriners, they 
still didn't want to kill a woman. 

“You can’t rhide this,” she told 
them vehemently. “Every human 
being, on Earth or Murrane or 
anywhere else, is bound to know 
the truth anyway in a few years. 
You should be trying to heal the 
differences between Earth and 
Murrane, not carry on this in- 
sane war!” 

“That’s a point of view,” one 
of the Murriners admitted. “An- 
other is that we’ve a much better 
chance of getting what we want, 
on our own terms, if Earth 
doesn’t have the faintest idea 
what our motivation is.” 

“But your own people think — ” 
“When did any people,” the 
Murriner said gently, “ever know 
truly, exactly, why they were 
fighting a war?” 

S O THEY systematically de- 
stroyed her knowledge. The 
first thing to go, of course, was 



that little piece of knowledge — 
the true motive for the war. But 
they didn’t stop there. Only one 
thing, at this point, was missing 
out of a well-ordered, well-stock- 
ed brain, and she would therefore 
soon get it back by calculation, 
observation or guess. So the next 
thing to go was her entire per- 
sonal experience.. All her memo- 
ries of every event in her life 
were cleared away like so much 
rubble. She didn’t know who she 
was or anything she had ever 
done. 

But she still knew language 
and how to read and write and 
walk and talk and think. She 
could still be identified in five 
minutes by these things. So they 
had to go, too. 

All that she had learned in 
years of life and study was re- 
moved in a few hours. But there 
was a difference between what 
was done to her personal mem- 
ories and what was done to her 
general knowledge, including 
language. The memories were 
erased completely; the knowl- 
edge was merely blotted out. 
Thus when they came to teach 
her English again, she learned 
very quickly but talked quite 
differently. They taught her to 
write again, and as if to help 
them she automatically wrote 
with her left hand though she 
had always written with her 
right. Her writing was complete- 



6 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ly different, of course. 

“Where am I? Who am I?" 
she asked often. 

At first, when she knew only 
a few words, they didn’t answer. 
But when they saw she could 
understand, they told her, to 
quieten her, that she was Muriel 
Martin. 

She repeated the name hesi- 
tantly; “Muriel Martin. Mur-iel 
Mar-tin. Martin. Muriel — ” and 
then burst out suddenly: “But 
that’s not my name!" 

“All right," she was told. “Call 
yourself anything you like. Do 
you know any other name?” 

She was silent. She didn’t. 
They hadn’t told her any other 
names. 

After that, they changed her 
physically. First they altered her 
metabolism. It was a tiny 
change, but her rather dark skin 
became much lighter, she ate 
less, she began to like foods she 
had disliked and lose her taste 
for others, and she became more 
deliberate in her movements, far 
less restless. An inch came off 
her hip measurement and two 
inches off her chest, Other 
changes were made merely for 
the sake of change. But since the 
people who worked on her were 
artists in their way, since they 
had to change in any case, since 
they were experimenting — they 
improved. They straightened the 
bones of her legs, corrected her 



stance and toughened the muscles 
of her neck and shoulders, so 
that she stood an inch and a half 
taller. It was enough. Big changes 
Were completely unnecessary. 

^T^HE process, however, wasn’t 
done with kindness, considera- 
tion and loving care. Since there 
had to be pain, they used it for 
conditioning. To make sure the 
conditioning was effective, they 
did nothing about quite a tot of 
pain that could have been 
avoided. 

She was conditioned against 
taking any interest in the Earth- 
Murrane war, on one side or the 
other. Most particularly she was 
conditioned against ever coming 
back to Murrane. The latter was 
selective, since they had so much 
effective pain to play about with 
— they could afford to condition 
her to mild respect for Murrane, 
and strongly against ever coming 
back to it. There was enough 
stimulus available to hammer 
home even a complicated lesson. 

After all this, they removed 
the personal memories she had 
begun to build up again since the 
last rape of her mind, and left 
everything else alone. They test- 
ed her, and were pleased. Inside 
two weeks — it had had to be in- 
side two weeks — they had de- 
stroyed one woman and put 
another, quite different, in her 
place. She would never remember

her previous history, for it wasn’t 
there to be remembered. 

When the job was finished, they 
drugged her to insensibility and 
took her to a small ship, a two- 
man vessel that could not only 
make the journey from Murrane 
to the Solar System, but could 
land almost anywhere in reason- 
able safety, being so small and so 
obviously harmless. 

The pilot of the ship, who 
would have to fly it without as- 
sistance farther than any such 
ship had ever been flown before, 
frowned and asked who the girl 
was to merit such consideration. 

It would be better for him not 
to know now, he was told. But he 
could ask when he came back, if 
he wished. 

He never came back. His ship, 
tiny as it was, was spotted by the 
Terran fleet out beyond Pluto and 
destroyed when it tried to run. It 
was ironic, for he wasn’t entering 
the Solar System, but leaving it, 
having done his job. He was do- 
ing no harm. 

But in war an enemy is an 
enemy, whether he’s doing any 
harm or not. 

II 

T HOUGH there must have 
been days when she was near 
the threshold of awareness, it was 
on a definite day, almost at a 
definite second , that she was fully 



conscious and aware of being 
conscious. 

She looked around her, but 
that was unnecessary. Before full 
consciousness there had been per- 
ception, and she knew her sur- 
roundings. 

She was sitting in a garden — a 
warm, healthy, luxurious garden, 
obviously on Venus. She felt 
light, but on Mars she would be 
lighter still. Here she could hold 
out her aim straight from the 
shoulder and keep it there for 
half an hour without discomfort. 
It was breathing that was most 
different. On Earth, one was sel- 
dom completely unaware of it. 
It was a mild labor to breathe, 
raising chest and shoulders, ex- 
panding ribs. Here the air seemed 
to flow in and out of its own voli- 
tion. There was no tendency to 
droop when exhaling. The chest 
didn’t fall, it merely grew a little 
smaller. One didn’t have to 
breathe fast and shallowly, as on 
Mars. 

On Mars, too, it would be very 
much colder. She was wearing 
white shorts and blouse, nothing 
else. She wasn’t heavy enough to 
have to wear shoes to protect her 
feet. And on Venus — a point of 
interest to most women who went 
there — it was usually quite un- 
necessary to wear a brassiere or a 
girdle. Even flabby pectoral and 
abdominal muscles could hold 
flesh firm against the mild gravi-

tational pull of Venus, three- 
twentieths less than that of Earth. 

Yes, she was on Venus, without 
a doubt. A hundred other things 
confirmed it — the low, heavy- 
clouds, the heat, the perfectly- 
diffused sunlight that made shad- 
ows almost non-existent, the lush- 
ness of the grass, the haze over 
the forests, the smell of the air . 

All of which showed that she 
knew Venus, Earth and Mars, at 
least. 

S HE was alone. But when she 
turned her head, she s^w a 
vwhite building through the trees. 
In the other direction, down the 
hill, she knew there was a tall 
wire fence. This, then, pleasant 
though it might be, was a prison 
of some kind. She fingered her 
blouse thoughtfully. Though 
clean and fine, it was very plain, 
a common pattern, the kind of 
garment that wouldn’t generally 
be worn from choice. 

She wasn’t disturbed. She 
knew she was called Muriel Mar- 
tin, and was pretty sure that 
wasn’t her real name — but who- 
ever she was, wherever she was, 
however she had got there, she 
was quite confident of her ability 
to handle the situation. 

Trying to look into the past, 
even the recent past, was unpleas- 
ant. She gave up the effort as far 
as the distant past was concern- 
ed. There was nothing there, and 



a curious finality about the noth- 
ing. But she explored the recent 
past conscientiously, ignoring the 
disinclination to do so. 

There were shadow-memories 
of testing and probing, people 
trying to make her do things she 
couldn’t do. There was also the 
hurt of being treated as little bet- 
ter than an animal because she 
was little better than an animal, 
yet knowing that she was very 
nearly a sane, intelligent human 
being. But there was no mali- 
ciousness in that ; the people were 
really trying to help her. 

There was one spot of mali- 
ciousness, however. Something 
concerning a Security officer. He 
had been vile. She didn’t remem- 
ber much about what had hap- 
pened, but he had been thoroughly 
unpleasant, tearing with his ques- 
tions and suspicion and anger and 
disbelief at the brain that was 
trying to heal. She classed him, 
on the little she could recall, as 
a petty, frustrated official, the 
kind of man who must always be 
a failure in handling people but 
who so often is permitted to try. 

Before that there was — horror. 
She knew nothing about it and 
didn’t want to. Though she 
probed for it grimly, she was 
rather glad when she was forced 
to the realization that it was 
quite unavailable to her. 

She rose lightly. The apparent 
loss of even a small fraction of

weight makes anyone feel an ath- 
lete, An athlete feels like jumping 
over trees. She ran, not because 
she was in any hurry, but because 
she felt like running. 

She stopped when she saw an- 
other girl, also alone and also 
wearing the same kind of blouse 
and shorts. This girl was pretty 
but there was something missing 
in her face. Muriel saw that even 
before she spoke. 

Two minutes later Muriel 
turned away. The girl was only 
dimly aware that someone was 
talking to her. She made sounds 
in reply, agreeably, and there was 
clearly no harm in her. But her 
I.Q. couldn’t be more than 60 
and was probably much less. 

In half an hour, Muriel had 
spoken to a dozen or so women 
in the grounds — and that was 
enough to show her that she was 
in some kind of home for sub- 
normals. 

Her confidence subsided a 
little. People didn’t get into 
places like this without good rea- 
son. That blank spot of horror in 
the past— was it really horrible, 
or was it something a sane mind 
should have taken in its stride? 
Had it just been something she 
couldn’t take, something she had 
scuttled from in fear instead of 
facing boldly? She was sane 
now, she believed — but perhaps 
that was something that didn’t 
happen often. Perhaps she had 



brainstorms. Perhaps . 

She put aside the anxious, 
frightened thoughts that rushed 
into her mind. If she wasn’t often 
sane, the sooner she made good 
use of this lucid spell the better. 

Anyway, the other women she 
had seen didn’t seem to be in- 
sane. There might be psychotics 
here, too— but for the most part 
they had seemed merely sub- 
normal. 

She walked up to the house. 
Before crossing the hall, she took 
a pair of sandals from a cup- 
board just inside the door and 
put them on. That was automatic. 
She wondered how often she had 
been here . how often she had 
done that without really knowing 
what she was doing. 

She hesitated before tapping on 
a door at the end of a white cor- 
ridor. She had a clear enough 
picture of the man inside, though 
she didn’t remember his name. 
She had no fear of him, certain- 
ly; he was old and kind, though 
sometimes rather fierce. What 
caused her hesitation was the 
sudden realization that she didn’t 
know what she herself looked 
like . whether she was young 
or old ... 

Resolutely, she tapped at the 
door and went in. 

I'TiHE man was as she remem - 
**■ bered him, and she knew at 
once she could trust him. He

wore an ordinary lounge suit, 
which made him almost ludi- 
crously overdressed on Venus. But 
a lot of older people dressed like 
that. It wasn’t that they objected 
to scanty apparel, but only that 
they felt they couldn't behave 
with any authority if they were 
half naked. 

“Hallo, Muriel,” he said pleas- 
antly. “Sit down.” His eyes were 
keen, she saw, not missing much. 

“I think you asked me ques- 
tions before, doctor,” she said 
briskly, “and couldn’t get much 
out of me. Would you like to try 
again?” 

The expression on his face be- 
came almost delighted. His eager- 
ness, Muriel guessed, was the 
natural sympathy and interest of 
anyone who worked among hand- 
icapped people, the joy in any 
sign of improvement. 

“You’ve recovered your mem- 
ory?” he asked. 

“No, I’m afraid not. I still 
don’t know a thing about myself. 
Not even how old I am or how I 
look.” 

The doctor showed no sign of 
disappointment. “Perhaps we 
should deal with that first,” he 
said. “You want to know how 
you look?” 

“Well, I'm naturally interest- 
ed.” She smiled. “Ever meet a 
woman who was more or less 
sane and didn’t know whether 
she was tall or short, young or 



old, pretty or ugly?” 

“Before you look at yourself,” 
said the doctor, “do you think it’s 
all right to do it? I mean, you 
haven’t any fear of looking in a 
mirror?” 

“No. Only an in — ” She stum- 
bled. 

“What’s the trouble?” asked 
the doctor sympathetically. She 
remembered now that his name 
was Johnston. 

“Just words. I was going to 
say only a something curiosity, 
but I don’t know the word. It 
means very strong.” 

“Intense?” 

“That’s it. Intense curiosity,” 
She tried the words over once or 
twice, and found they came easi- 
ly- 

The doctor rose from behind 
his desk and opened a cupboard. 
“There’s a full-length mirror in- 
side the door.” 

Muriel got up and stood in 
front of the mirror. She had 
braced herself mentally, for she 
hoped she was young but knew 
she might have to bear the dis- 
appointment of seeing she was 
old. She wanted to be pretty, but 
the chance of that seemed small 
— she had some shadowy aware- 
ness that she wasn’t pretty. 

What she saw wasn’t anything 
like what she had expected. 

She was young, clearly — not 
more than twenty-five at the 
most. And she was beautiful,

11 



astonishingly beautiful . but 
even that consideration was swept 
away for the moment by some- 
thing she wouldn’t have believed 
possible, even granting her al- 
most complete loss of memory. 

The girl facing her in the mir- 
ror was a complete stranger. She 
had never seen her before in her 
life. 

"PRESENTLY, Muriel was do- 
ing an intelligence test. She 
had told Dr. Johnston, unprompt- 
ed, that she thought she could do 
a non-verbal test adequately, but 
as yet a verbal test would give a 
misleading result. He said noth- 
ing, merely gave her a book and 
a pencil. 

He watched her as she worked; 
it didn’t seem to bother her at 
all. He noticed that she tried the 
pencil in one hand, then the other, 
before beginning to write with 
her left, at first awkwardly, and 
then with more precision. He 
hadn’t suggested that she should 
work at the desk, waiting to see 
what she would do. She’d crossed 
her legs and worked quite con- 
fidently with the book on her 
knee. Stenographer? he wondered. 

She was apparently completely 
sane, but the type of amnesia 
was puzzling. It was oddly selec- 
tive. It was curious that she 
should remember nothing what- 
ever of her own life and yet have 
almost free access to the normal 



general knowledge and vocabu- 
lary of an educated person. He 
knew he wasn’t handling her as 
the textbooks said such a case 
should be handled, but he felt 
certain without working it out 
that it was much better to give 
her mind a lot to do than too 
little. She hardly needed direc- 
tions on how to do the intelli- 
gence test. She saw the form of 
it and became absorbed in it. 

Muriel finished the test and 
handed it back to him. He put it 
aside, 

"Aren't you going to check it 
and tell me how I’ve done?" she 
asked. 

"It isn’t normally done." 

"I know. But it would help me, 
I think. I don’t know whether 
I’m above or below average. It 
will help me plan my life, when 
I’m ready to plan. I’d like to 
know what that shows, please." 

TTER confidence impressed him. 

From the moment she’d en- 
tered the room she had been com- 
pletely at home, unperturbed by 
the situation. 

He checked the test and refer- 
red to a list. 

“This gives you an I.Q. of 130 
plus,” he told her. 

“What does that mean?" 

“That you're in the top two per 
cent of the population in intelli- 
gence. It doesn’t show any more 
than that. The standard devia-

tion in this test is fifteen . do 
you know what I’m talking 
about?” 

“I think so. You mean fifteen 
points are arranged to cover about 
a third of all people. A third be- 
tween 85 and 100, and another 
third between 100 and 115. And 
I’m 130.” 

’‘You’re 130 plus. Anything 
over 130. That is, the test takes 
no responsibility for you. It’s 
meant to grade normal and sub- 
normal people to a certain extent 
that shouldn’t be overestimated.” 
“Not absolute but — ?*' 
“Empirical. Statistical.” 

“I see. What’s the next move?” 
Unexpectedly his face grew 
hard, even angry. But she knew 
the anger wasn’t against her. 

“Security,” he said. “They’ve 
insisted on seeing you again, as 
soon as possible. I’m afraid it’s 
possible now. I’m sorry, Miss 
Martin. Do you remember any- 
thing about the last time a Se- 
curity officer saw you?” 

“Yes, a little — and I don’t like 
what I remember. What is this 
Security? Why do they insist on 
seeing me?” 

“They think you might be a 
Murriner spy,” said the doctor 
derisively. 

“Murrane,” the girl mused. 
“I’ve never been there and I 
don’t want to go there. I’m not 
interested in the war.” 

“You know about the war?” 



asked the doctor quickly. 

“Only that there is one. Oh, 
well ... if I have to see this man, 
doctor, it might as well be now.” 
Dr. Johnston stared at her for 
a few moments, then nodded. He 
picked up the phone on his desk. 

Ill 

N URSE BRAYNE was a chat- 
terbox. The words poured 
out of her in a sort of verbal 
peipetuum mobile r a pleasant 
sound if one didn’t pay too much 
attention to what she was saying. 

“Yes, you’re my size, as near 
as makes no difference,” she said, 
surveying Muriel. “We’d better 
hurry, Miss Martin — shall I call 
you Muriel? Security said some- 
one would be along about four, 
but it would be just like Security 
to say that and make it two hours 
earlier, to catch you on the hop. 
That’s the way they work. Of 
course, it’s all necessary and no 
doubt they do a valuable job, but 
sometimes one wonders why they 
have to be so tough about it. I’m 
so glad you’re all right now — I 
always thought there was some- 
thing different about you, you 
always looked so clever, even 
when you were . but that’s all 
over, and I’m sure you’ll be able 
to stand up to this officer and let 
him see he can’t push you around 
— he can’t really, you know, if 
you only remember you’ve noth-

ing to be afraid of. They’re hard 
and suspicious, and they work 
on people by making them ner- 
vous and jumpy, and if you re- 
fuse to be nervous they have to 
climb down and be civil. Dr. 
Johnston says it’s a crime that 
they should be allowed to come 
here and — ” 

On it went, with Muriel half 
listening, because she knew so 
little that she could learn even 
from Nurse Brayne. 

It was still only two hours 
since she had come to full con- 
sciousness in the garden. She 
knew now that six weeks ago she 
had wandered into a village fifty 
miles away, Norbum, dirty and 
disheveled and completely dazed. 
There had been a search for a 
crashed ship or plane in the vi- 
cinity, but nothing was found. 
At first it had been thought that 
she was suffering from ordinary 
shock, but it soon appeared to 
be more than that. She had been 
taken to the nursing home, not 
because that seemed the right 
permanent place for her, but be- 
cause she had to be sent some- 
where where she could be looked 
after. 

‘'Dr. Johnston’s quite right,” 
said Nurse Brayne. “You’ll feel 
so much more confident if you 
know you're looking your best.” 

“Will I?” asked Muriel. “I 
don’t think it would make any 
difference to me, Helen.” 



“Don’t you care about clothes?” 
“No.” 

That almost made Nurse 
Brayne speechless for a while. 

TT had been Dr. Johnston’s 
idea to freshen Muriel up be- 
fore the Security Officer came, 
and in one respect, Muriel agreed, 
it was a good idea. People did 
judge you by your appearance. 
If you were well-groomed and 
immaculately dressed, people 
were a little more cautious with 
you, afraid of what you might 
think, feeling themselves at a 
disadvantage. But in the end, 
your manner mattered more. 

Anyway, Helen Brayne had 
volunteered to take her away and 
make her more presentable. Mur- 
iel had showered and was now in 
the nurse’s bedroom, waiting pa- 
tiently for Nurse Brayne to de- 
cide what she should wear. 

“Are you a max or a min?” the 
nurse asked. 

"I'm afraid I don’t follow that,” 
said Muriel. “I can guess you 
mean maximum or minimum, but 
that doesn’t help.” 

“You must have known, but 
forgotten,” said Helen. “Every- 
body’s a max or a min. You wear 
as much as you can for any oc- 
casion, or as little.” 

Muriel smiled. “No, that’s new 
to me . but surely people are 
sometimes one thing, sometimes 
the other?” 



14 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“It's all right if you’ve got 
natural taste,” said Helen cheer- 
fully. “But how many girls 
have? If they follow a pattern— 
max-min, bright-somber, plain- 
frilly, and so on — they can be 
sure that they’re dressed more or 
less right most of the time. It’s 
quite sensible, really. If you’re 
overdressed for a ball and under- 
dressed for a garden party, you’re 
not giving your personality a 
chance. Are you sure you never 
heard of max-min? You seem to 
know most things, and this has 
been going on for five years now.” 
Muriel found that interesting. 
“On Venus and Earth, you 
mean?” 

“And Mars.” 

“Suppose I haven’t been on 
Venus or Earth or Mars in the 
last five years?” 

Helen ceased abruptly to be 
the gay chatterbox and became 
the surprisingly efficient nurse. 
“I see what you mean. Or you 
could have lost your memory five 
years ago. But if you weren’t 
here, you must have been on 
Murrane.” 

“Murrane? I’ve never been 
there. Isn’t there anywhere else 
I could have been?” 

“Not that I know of, unless 
you’re an explorer. Well, what 
are you — max or min?” 

"Max, I guess.” 

Helen looked surprised. “Oh, 
well, if you say so. People who 



look like you generally prove it, 
if you know what I mean. Say, 
Muriel — ” she was serious again 
— “don’t give the Security man 
any idea that you’ve been out of 
this System in the last five years. 
They’re suspicious by vocation.” 

She turned back to the drawer 
whose contents she was investi- 
gating. 

Muriel reflected that perhaps 
the Security men had to be hard 
and tough and suspicious, to 
counteract the openness and 
friendliness of people like Dr. 
Johnston and Nurse Brayne, who 
seemed to take it for granted that 
she couldn’t possibly be a spy or 
saboteur or anything of the sort. 

It was more than Muriel took 
for granted herself. 

1YURSE BRAYNE had been 

^ quite right. While she was 
brushing Muriel’s hair, over two 
hours before the Security Officer 
was due, there came an imperious 
summons relayed by a rather 
scared nurse. Captain Clark was 
in Dr. Johnston’s room and want- 
ed to see Muriel Martin im- 
mediately. 

Dr. Johnston met her in the 
hall and, probably against all 
the rules, told her fiercely that if 
that tough jumped-up cop said 
anything she didn’t like, she 
could press the bell under the 
desk and he’d come running in 
to take him apart.

“Thanks, doctor,” said Muriel 
warmly. “But I don’t think it’ll 
be necessary, now.” 

She had remembered a little 
more of the last occasion when a 
Security Officer had come to see 
her. She’d been able to say only 
a few words at the time, and 
couldn’t understand what was go- 
ing on. But she had felt the truc- 
ulence of the man, his suspicion, 
his anger; his emotion had been 
like a physical attack on her. 
When he touched her roughly, 
though he hadn’t really done any- 
thing much, she had felt terrified 
and utterly helpless. He had tried 
to force the truth out of her, 
when the only possible way to get 
anything out of her at all, as Dr. 
Johnston must have told him, 
was to draw it out with infinite 
gentleness and patience. 

Muriel opened the door of the 
doctor’s room and went inside. It 
was very different from the last 
time she had entered it, only a 
short time ago. The man behind 
the desk this time was younger 
than she expected, not as hard 
looking as she expected, but quite 
as grim and humorless. He wore 
some kind of uniform, blue and 
spruce. He looked up from some 
papers he held as she came in. 

Muriel was glad, after all, that 
she was neatly and attractively 
dressed. For just a fraction of a 
second, Captain Clark’s eyes 
widened and flickered over her. 



and she knew that he was human. 
It was worth it for that. 

Then he was himself again. 
“Please disabuse your mind,” he 
said coldly, “of anything you've 
heard about Security in this 
somewhat uncooperative estab- 
lishment." 

That was nasty. In typical Se- 
curity fashion, even with a girl 
in a nursing home, he was start- 
ing off by trying to cow her, to 
undermine her confidence in her- 
self. 

“It’s all right,” said Muriel 
easily. “I'm disabused.” 

“I didn’t say you could sit 
down,” said Clark sharply, as 
she moved toward the other 
chair. 

S HE sat down. “Captain Clark," 
she said, “I started off with 
the fixed determination of coop- 
erating with you all I possibly 
could- Are you going to insist on 
making it hard for me to do 
that?” 

“Yes,” he said. 

“Why?” 

“I’m asking the questions." 
“You haven’t asked any yet." 
“Why are you determined to 
cooperate? Because you have 
something to hide?" 

Muriel laughed. “Could be. 
I’m hiding it very successfully 
from myself, and I could do with 
your help, or anyone else’s to 
find out what it is.”

“Do you realize I have the 
power of life and death over 
you?” 

“No. I don't think you have.” 

“I give you my solemn word 
that if I thought you were a Mur- 
riner and had any chance of es- 
caping, I’d shoot you here and 
now.” 

“Oh, no doubt. But that’s hard- 
ly relevant, is it?” 

She had realized some time ago 
that he was acting a part. The 
other Security Officer, whom she 
dimly remembered, had been 
either a different type of man or 
a much better actor — but the goal 
was the same. They both tried to 
push her, to annoy her, to fright- 
en her. Only the first officer had 
succeeded. The second wasn’t go- 
ing to. 

“How do you feel about the 
Earth -Murrane war?” 

“I don’t give a damn about the 
war.” 

“Why is that?” Clark rapped. 
“We’re fighting for our System, 
our very lives, and you don’t 
care?” 

“No, I'm afraid not. Maybe 
I’ve had nothing to do with the 
war.” 

“Don’t try to explain it. I can 
see what your answers mean. Do 
you think we should just sur- 
render to the Murriners?” 

“I don’t know- about that. Re- 
member, I’ve only just waked up. 
What are you trying to do, put 



me back to sleep again?” 

“Ah,” said Clark softly, “I’ve 
touched a tender spot, have I?” 
“No. That was an honest re- 
quest for information.” 

Clark came out from behind 
the desk. “Sit closer to the desk,” 
he said, standing over her. 

“What for?” demanded Muriel 
warily. 

“Sit closer!” he shouted. 

S HE pulled her chair closer to 
the desk. She had an idea, by 
this time, that nothing very seri- 
ous was going to happen. He 
took a small plastic case from his 
pocket, placed it on the desk in 
front of her and opened it. Inside 
was a morse key, a small light 
and a buzzer. 

“Hold that key down,” he said. 
“When the light goes on and the 
buzzer sounds, let the key up as 
quickly as you can. Got that?” 
“Yes.” Muriel searched her 
mind for the term ‘reaction time’, 
but though the idea was perfectly 
clear, she couldn’t quite find the 
words. 

Twenty times the buzzer 
sounded and the light flashed. 
Then Clark opened the back of 
the little case and took out a 
card. 

“Point three six, point two 
nine, two seven, three two, three 
one — ” he read. 

“I don’t believe you,” said 
Muriel. 



MIND ALONE 



17 



He grunted, but didn’t let her 
see the card. He was a very bad 
actor* Muriel thought. It was 
quite obvious that he was no 
longer in the least suspicious of 
her, though he kept up the pre- 
tense of brusqueness. He was 
really rather nice, she thought, 
sensing the good nature behind 
his formidable front. 

She found the term she was 
looking for. “Murriners have 
slower reaction times than we 
do, then?” she asked, interested. 

“You didn’t know that?” 

“I believe I did. Is the hold-up 
at the synapses?” 

He tried to snap back at her, 
but couldn’t. “No, the transmis- 
sion through the nerve fiber is 
slower.” 

“Of course. Range of about 
four to sixty meters a second, in- 
stead of five to a hundred — funny 
how I can remember figures. But 
that couldn’t always be a con- 
clusive test, then.” 

Clark simulated biting sar- 
casm. “Maybe you could find a 
better one?” 

“I’m sure I could. A blood test, 
perhaps. Isn’t there something in 
Murrane’s air, soluble in the 
blood, that affects the endocrine 
glands — modifying the chemical 
reactions, changing some of the 
enzymes . , 

“Sure,” said Clark. “Only I 
can’t carry around a laboratory 
I can carry this. Say, aren’t you 



supposed to have lost your mem- 
ory?” he added, forgetting to be 
tough. 

“I was surprised I remembered 
that,” said Muriel, pleased. “Tell 
you what, let me test my own 
blood and I'll tell you whether 
I'm a Murriner or not.” 

It was too much for Captain 
Peter Clark. He stared at her for 
a moment, then laughed. 

“All right,” he said. “You win. 
Can I call you Muriel?” 

IV 

VK/HEN Captain Peter Clark 
W left the Veborn nursing 
home, he should have been be- 
ginning to forget that Muriel 
Martin even existed. His job in 
Security was counter-espionage, 
nothing else. Having satisfied 
himself that Muriel wasn’t a 
Murriner, he had done his job, 
and as far as he was concerned 
she should have ceased to exist. 

But back on Murrane no al- 
lowance had been made for the 
fact that Peter Clark was young- 
er than most Security Officers 
and had always liked intelligent 
brunettes who didn’t lose their 
tempers. Murriners, naturally, 
had a different view of Security 
Officers, and certainly didn’t re- 
gard them as human beings. 

So instead of starting to forget 
Muriel, Clark was running over 
possible excuses to pursue the 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



matter, and Muriel. 

At the nursing home, Muriel 
was assuring Dr. Johnston and 
Nurse Brayne that Security Offi- 
cers weren’t as bad as they 
thought. 

“He explained himself after- 
wards,” she said. “I suppose I 
shouldn’t pass it on to you, but 
I don’t think it will do any harm. 
Murriners feel inferior — they 
can’t help it. They deny it, of 
course, even boast that a Mur- 
riner is better than a Terran any 
day, but it’s there. They’re angry- 
defensive. And the best way to 
discover them is to be angry-of- 
fensive. I saw Clark was only 
trying to annoy me, and that 
what was said didn’t really mat- 
ter. So he didn’t annoy me at 
all.” 

Dr. Johnston had been looking 
at her closely as she spoke. 
“You’re quite normal, Miss Mar- 
tin,” he said. "In fact, I rarely 
met anyone saner. You’re almost 
aggressively sane.” 

Muriel laughed. “Yes. But tell 
me — what can I do now?” 

“You can walk out of here any 
time you like, now that you’ve 
been passed by Security. But 
that doesn’t help you much, since 
you haven’t any job or relatives 
or mone^. I suggest that you work 
in the office here. It won’t pay 
much, but at least you’ll be inde- 
pendent and we’ll be able to help 
you to get your bearings.” 



“Thanks, doctor,” said Muriel 
warmly. “I’ll do that for a while 
anyway. Am I really free?” 

“Of course. It isn’t a crime to 
have lost your memory. You were 
never certified, and this isn’t an 
asylum.” 

Impulsively Nurse Brayne, an 
affectionate creature, put her arm 
around Muriel’s shoulders. “We’ll 
try to make you happy,” she 
said. 

riiHREE days later Muriel had 
* taken over the running of the 
office. No one there had any or- 
ganizing ability, and everyone 
was glad to pass the reins over to 
her. 

She didn’t believe, however, 
that she had ever worked in an 
office before. She found she was 
much more at home in the 
pharmacy. Gradually things were 
being confirmed or denied. She 
was a chemist of sorts, but not a 
doctor. Yet a lot of biology was 
familiar to her, and when she 
discovered anthropology the sub- 
ject was clearly not new to her. 
In mechanics she was completely 
blank; dynamics meant nothing 
to her. In fact, there were sub- 
jects on the technological side 
that she didn’t even seem to have 
heard of. Chemistry was the best 
bet. She regained whole chunks 
of knowledge merely by picking 
up bottles and looking at the 
labels. 



MIND ALONE

She was learning all the time, 
and enjoying the process. Often 
she would merely look at the 
name of a substance, and into her 
mind would come a picture of it 
and all the things it would do. 

On the fourth day she had a 
visitor. 

“Not Captain Clark,” he pro- 
tested. “Call me Peter. Can you 
take the afternoon, off?” 

“Easily,” she said, “if I’m 
shown a good reason.”' 

He frowned. “I don’t know 
whether it’s good or not,” he ad- 
mitted, “but I’ve been thinking 
it up ever since I saw you last.” 
She laughed, and gave herself 
the afternoon off. 

T HEY didn’t have to stay in 
the grounds, but they didn’t 
go far from them. One couldn’t 
sit anywhere on Venus without 
being soaked, but Peter was pre- 
pared. He spread a thin plastic 
groundsheet on the steaming 
grass. Muriel sat at one comer of 
it and motioned him to stay on 
the other. 

“Not too close,” she told him. 
“I may be married, you know, 
and I’d better stay faithful just 
in case.” 

Peter’s eyes widened. “I never 
thought of that,” he said. “Let’s 
see your left hand . look, you 
never wore a ring!” 

“Doesn’t prove anything,” she 
smiled. “Now, what about this 



reason you were going to show 
me?” 

Peter became more serious. 
“Frankly, at first I was only 
looking for an excuse to see you 
again,” he admitted. “And if I 
hadn’t found one, I’d have come 
anyway. But I did find one, I 
think. What does your history, as 
far as you know it, suggest to you 
about how you lost your mem- 
ory? Anything?” 

She shook her head. “Does it 
suggest something to you?” 

“Yes. You didn't lose your 
memory. You had it lost for 
you.” 

He put it bluntly, and Muriel 
not only understood at once, but 
also agreed with it. 

“But how could that happen?” 
she asked. “You mean someone 
hit me over the head, or some- 
thing?” 

“No — not that kind of thing at 
all. If someone loses her memory 
by what you might call natural 
means, she’s not normal and con- 
fident but without her personal 
history, like you. She’s dazed and 
lost and doubtful, and she has 
quite a lot of her personal history, 
if she remembers as much as you 
do. Loss of identity is common, 
but — ” 

“I see what you mean,” said 
Muriel slowly. “People wouldn’t 
have language and knowledge — 
but not a single recollection of 
anything that ever happened to 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



them. I don’t remember any per- 
son I ever knew, or going to 
school, or what I used to look 
like—” 

TTE was on that like a flash. For 
** an hour or so, they carefully 
examined what she knew and 
what she didn’t. Nothing very 
much emerged from it, but 
Peter’s idea got some support. It 
was as if everything she had ever 
learned had been put either into 
a personal or a general memory 
bank, and then the personal bank 
had been taken away. 

“Which doesn’t happen by ac- 
cident,” he said. “Muriel, there’s 
one psychiatrist on Venus who 
might be able to find out some- 
thing more about this. Will you 
go and see him?” 

“Of course. Who is he?” 

“Dr. Waterson, at Finylake. I 
can fly you there any day you 
like.” 

They settled the details of 
that, and Peter heaved a sigh of 
relief. “That was all very well,” 
he said, “but I came out with a 
girl, not a psychiatric case. Can 
I move a little closer, please?” 
“How about my not-out-of- 
the- question husband?” 

“You don’t remember any hus- 
band, do you? Well, you haven’t 
got one.” He moved closer. 

“Quite a lot of people would 
refuse to believe this of a Securi- 
ty Officer Muriel observed 



brightly. “Aren’t they all hard 
and tough and unsympathetic?” 
“That’s just a myth. Just give 
me a chance and I’ll prove it.” 
He moved closer still. 

“Suppose I were to turn out to 
be a Murriner spy?” 

“That’s the core of the whole 
thing,” said Peter with satisfac- 
tion. “This is bare-faced black- 
mail. If you don’t let me kiss you, 
I’ll tell Security you’re a Murri- 
ner after all, and they’ll take you 
out and shoot you. See?” 

“I don't want to be shot,” Mur- 
iel admitted. He took her in his 
arms and kissed her very thor- 
oughly. 

T^R. WATERSON was one of 
the new electronic psychia- 
trists. He seemed to have grown 
a little electronic himself ; he 
hummed like an electric motor as 
he worked, his little black eyes 
glittered like nuclei, and his black 
hair perpetually stood on end as 
if charged with electricity. 

He ignored Muriel and Peter 
completely as he gathered data 
from his various machines. 
Though he used a lot of appar- 
atus, his work was by no means 
all electronic. The word in any 
case was a misnomer; it had been 
applied to men like Dr. Waterson 
through wholesale confusion of 
psychiatry and cybernetics, en- 
cephalographs and electronic 
brains, electricity and electronics, 



MIND ALONE 



21 




and had been so generally used 
that it had stuck. Now Waterson 
himself called his profession elec- 
tronic psychiatry — an example of 
the power of the uninformed lay- 
man. 

Dr. Waterson’s work wasn’t all 
electric, then— he had put some 
pretty shrewd questions to Muri- 
el while connecting her to this 
machine and that, and she was 
wondering, now that it was over, 
how much of his use of impress- 
ive apparatus was window-dress- 
ing. 

At lasf*he said, “I’m not going 
to charge you anything, Miss 
Martin. Which means, I’m afraid, 
that I can’t produce any results.” 
“What we know now is tenta- 
tive, doctor,” Peter put in. 
“Can’t you add anything, even 
if it’s tentative too?” 

“I can only say this. If any 
tampering with Miss Martin’s 
brain was done — and I admit 
that this is a reasonable conclu- 
tion to reach — it was very well 
done. There is certainly an in- 
teresting problem here. It seems 
extremely unlikely that your loss 
of memory is due to any neu- 
rosis, Miss Martin. There is neu- 
rosis present, of course — ” 

“There is?” said Peter, startled. 
The psychiatrist smiled faint- 
ly. “I should hardly mention it, 
if it were significant. There are 
certain fixed patterns, or nearly 
fixed patterns, and fixation is 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




neurosis. I didn’t investigate 
those, because they seem to have 
nothing to do with the loss of 
memory. They seem to have been 
acquired afterward, possibly as a 
result . however, the loss of 
memory, if not neurotic, would 
certainly appear to be the result 
of some operation — ” 

“Surgical?” asked Peter. 

WATERSON shook his 
head. “There is no evidence 
of surgery. But there is also no 
evidence of anything else. I mere- 
ly assume, from a fair knowledge 
of the human mind, that it is not 
surgical. I wish X could say more. 
I can only repeat — if anything 
has been done, it has been, very 
well done. That simplifies the 
matter, if you wish to pursue it.” 
“Simplifies it?” Muriel exclaim- 
ed. “I should have thought it 
would be the other way round.” 
“Simplifies it,” repeated the 
psychiatrist patiently. “Have you 
a lot of money, Miss Martin?” 
“No.” 

“A pity. If you had, I should 
advise you to go to Earth and 
consult some of the leading elec- 
tronic psychiatrists there. You 
would soon find yourself on the 
right track. The quality of this 
hypothetical operation, you see, 
means that only a very few peo- 
ple could possibly have done it.” 
“I see,” said Muriel. 

As he was showing them out, 

23 



he asked curiously* “Do you in- 
tend to proceed with this, Miss 
Martin?” 

She hesitated. “I don’t think 
so. It’s not of tremendous impor- 
tance to me, and anyway it’ll be 
quite a while before I’ll be able 
to afford to go to Earth.” 

“A pity. You would have to go 
there. All the men who might be 
able to help you are there. Or on 
Murrane.” 

If he hadn’t added the last 
three words, principally to him- 
self, the matter would probably 
have died there. But Peter heard 
them and whirled around. 

“Murrane !” he exclaimed. 

“I didn’t propose Miss Martin 
should go there,” said the psy- 
chiatrist dryly. 

‘‘You mean there are people 
on Murrane who might have 
done this to Muriel?” 

“If anything was done, yes. 
Murrane is probably well ahead 
of us in electronic psychiatry. It’s 
the only branch of psychiatry 
they have, I believe.” 

“Then something will be done 
about this,” said Peter. “Security 
is taking it up. Come on, Muriel. 
You’re going to Security HQ 
after all!” 

V 

W HILE Peter’s little plane 
was making the short hop 
from Finylake to Veborn, Muriel 



asked coolly, “Am I a prisoner, 
Peter?” 

“That would be a very difficult 
question to answer,” said Peter 
cheerfully. “Let’s pretend you 
didn’t ask it, shall we?” 

“No. I don’t like that attitude 
at all. I want to know where I 
stand.” 

“How can anyone possibly tell 
you where you stand? That’s 
what we’re trying to find out.” 
“What are we going to do?” 
“First, you’ll have a thorough 
medical examination. That’ll 
show pretty definitely whether 
you could be a native Murriner 
or not. If that’s negative, as I 
expect it will be, I’m going to take 
you to Earth to see those psy- 
chiatrists that Dr. Waterson men- 
tioned.” 

“Why?” 

“I don’t know exactly why,” 
Peter admitted. “You don’t know 
anything about Security, Muriel, 
do you? Well, it’s an important 
job. This war is being fought 
mainly by two strong fleets that 
are trying to destroy each other, 
not advance on other objectives. 
Our fleet, say, can’t afford to go 
too far from this System while 
the Murriner fleet is still strong. 
It can’t afford to attack Mur- 
rane, because that would allow 
the Murriners to attack Earth 
freely. Space is big, and the only 
thing that prevents either side 
blasting the other’s base is the 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



knowledge that the fleet that 
tried it would be a total loss. Do 
you get the idea? There’s no split 
between defense and attack any 
more — it's just one fleet against 
another." 

“Go on. I don’t quite see how 
it must be like that, but I'll take 
your word for it.” 

“Our high command can’t be 
with the fleet, because that’s too 
mobile. The planning is prob- 
ably done on Earth, but the real 
base may be on Venus or Mars 
or even Pluto for all I know. 
Anyway, you can see that in a 
war like this, gains by either 
side can Only be made by doing 
something slightly out of the or- 
dinary. A raid on Murrane can 
be made and it can be effective, 
provided it’s carefully planned 
and the enemy gets no hint of 
the plan. 

“There’s the rub. Our spies 
get little or nothing out of Mur- 
rane, and Murrane is obviously 
getting quite a lot out of us. In 
direct proportion to that, they’re 
doing better than we are. 

“So Earth, at the moment, is 
losing this war, despite greater 
potential — and the section that’s 
failing is Security. Murrane is 
keeping this a battle of espionage 
and counter-espionage, and win- 
ning it. Do you see why we have 
to follow up any line that shows 
itself? If you were to turn out 
to be a Murriner spy, we'd be 



glad we’d found you, but it 
wouldn’t mean very much. We’ve 
found plenty of Murriner spies. 
But if we found something that 
was new — ’’ 

He brought the plane down 
neatly at Veborn landing-field. 
Almost at once the door was 
opened and two Security Officers 
waited on either side of it for 
Muriel to come out. 

“Then I am a prisoner?” she 
said. 

“I wish you’d just take things 
as they come, Muriel,” he said. 
“You’ve nothing to be afraid of.” 

“Yes, I have.” Incredibly, 
Muriel burst into tears. “You're 
trying to make me go to Mur- 
rane 1” she cried. 

Amazed, Peter stared at her. 

rpHE examination put it beyond 
-*■ doubt that Muriel was a na- 
tive Terran. 

“Apart from her slightly above 
normal reaction time,” the doctor 
observed, “there are several small 
things which, taken in the aggre- 
gate, show that she was born and 
grew up on Earth. I can't, of 
course, tell you whether she has 
ever been on Murrane or not. 
There are indications that she 
has. But any trace there may be 
of the Murrane enzymes is neg- 
ligible.” 

Peter visited Muriel in what 
he insisted on calling her room, 
not her cell. 



MIND ALONE

“Pve been talking to Dr. John- 
ston, Muriel," he said. “I told 
him you’ve been co-opted into 
Security.” 

Muriel was calm and at ease 
again. She had been as amazed 
as Peter at her breakdown. She 
wanted to know what could have 
made her do that. 

“And have I?” she asked. 

He shook his head. “I have a 
theory,” he said quietly, "that 
you were in it already.” 

Muriel started, but didn’t 
speak. 

"The doctor here added a few 
things to what we know about 
you," Peter went on. "Still noth- 
ing definite, but 'it’s building up. 
Waterson said your brain might 
have been tampered with by a 
very good electronic psychiatrist. 
The doctor here says you may 
have spent a long time on Mur- 
rane." 

“Does he? I thought he said — ” 

“1 persuaded him to go a little 
further after you’d gone. You 
see, we have to give people the 
benefit of the doubt, and he was 
assuming that you were a sus- 
pect, that your life depended on 
what he said. So he stated, cor- 
rectly, that the traces of Murrane 
enzymefe in your blood were neg- 
ligible. But when I told him the 
true circumstances and some of 
my own ideas, he admitted that 
while he wouldn’t convict you on 
it, he was pretty certain that you 



had been on Murrane . pos- 
sibly for some time. Unfortu- 
nately, while your mind was 
recovering, your body has been 
dissipating all traces of Mur- 
rane." 

Muriel nodded. "That’s so. 
Heavy tan. Vitamin D restored, 
reaction time accelerating again 
— if I was on Murrane, but only 
for a year or two, the journey 
here and a few weeks out in the 
open on Venus would cover up 
just about everything.” 

"The doctor also says," Peter 
went on, “that you’ve been 
physically changed in some way. 
There are things about you that 
don’t match. But that, again, was 
well done. Though there have 
been surgical operations, the main 
thing was a metabolic change. He 
can’t say what you were like be- 
fore.” 

"Another thing,” said Muriel 
quietly — and she told him how 
she and Nurse Brayne had first 
concluded that she might not 
have been on Earth during the 
last few years. 

"It all fits,” said Peter. 

"With what?” 

"It would all make sense," he 
said slowly, "if you were a Tzr- 
ran agent on Murrane, were 
found out, and for some reason of 
their own they didn’t kill you but 
sent you back here, altered." 

Muriel tried that for size. 

"It seems to make a certain 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



limited amount of sense,” she 
said cautiously. 

“Despite the definite fact that 
you were never on Murrane?” 

“I ... I’m not sure. But I do 
know I'm never going there!” 
“That,” said Peter, “is the 
most significant part of all.” 

VI 

rpHE hop from Venus to Earth 
was almost all acceleration 
and deceleration, and most peo- 
ple stayed in their bunks. Muriel 
used the time to read up on Mur- 
rane and the war. She had to 
overcome a disinclination even 
to read about them, but it could 
be done. She became interested 
in what she was reading, and the 
disinclination to have anything 
whatever to do with Murrane 
lost some of its force. 

But she remained quite deter- 
mined that it was out of the 
question for her ever to go there. 

She took it in three parts — 
Murrane itself, the war, and how 
either of these affected her or 
might possibly affect her. She had 
provided herself with half a doz- 
en pocketbooks, which she scan- 
ned for the meat in them. 

First, Murrane. 

It was a cold world, but so 
suitable for colonization in other 
respects that the cold was ac- 
cepted. There were no seasons; 
the inclination of the equator to 



the orbit was less than one de- 
gree, and its eccentricity was also 
extremely small. The year was 
216 days and the day thirty-eight 
hours, making a period which 
wasn't a great deal different from 
Earth’s year. The diameter was 
7500 miles, less than that of 
Earth, less even than that of 
Venus, but the mass and density 
made up for that. Temperature 
was Mu rr one’s one drawback. A 
top limit of 6S degrees F. had 
been recorded, but normal equa- 
torial temperature range was 
from 0 to 50 degrees F. Natural- 
ly, all the Murriner towns and 
cities were in a thousand-mile 
belt around the equator. 

Muriel found she knew all this 
as soon as she looked at it. She 
knew more, without going farth- 
er in the book. She knew that 
Murrane, surprisingly, was teem- 
ing with warm-blooded life, with 
no intelligent animals to prey on 
it until men came along. She 
knew that Murrane was rich in 
metals of all kinds. She knew 
that hydro-electric power was 
abundant. She knew how the 
Murriners dressed, in a one-piece 
snowsuit with a hood, over sev- 
eral layers of fine underclothing 
that trapped many blankets of 
air as insulation. 

It was pretty obvious that she 
had been on Murrane, despite 
the insistence by one part of her 
mind that she had not. 



MIND ALONE 



27 



She passed on to a brief re- 
view of the war. She didn’t feel 
any need to read more about 
Murrane and its people and his- 
tory. 

She knew all about them. 

¥T was a strange war. It had 
started out of mere suspicion, 
jealousy and differences, without 
warning. Earth had been careless, 
Murrane precipitate. Murrane 
was the attacker, but there were 
people on Earth who blamed 
Earth for the war. After all, there 
was such a historical record of 
colonies turning against the pa- 
rent country that it didn’t seem 
unfair to say Earth should have 
been more alert and never let a 
war like this happen. 

From the first, it was a space 
war. There had been raids on 
Earth and Murrane, but they 
weren’t worth the trouble. Each 
side insured that the other 
couldn't have a base near its 
own territory; any force raiding 
the enemy planet, therefore, had 
to start from home, evade the 
enemy fleet, advertise its pres- 
ence by an attack against objec- 
tives which were in any case well 
guarded, and then try to get 
home again. 

It couldn’t be done. It was a 
plain matter of statistics. If ships 
made long detours, their offensive 
power was cut down by the ne- 
cessity for so much fuel and 

28 



provisions. Moreover, they were 
unavailable, useless, not paying 
their way, all the time they were 
on the two long journeys. And if 
they attempted quick, bold raids, 
they were poking their heads into 
a natural trap. If the Terran 
fleet did nothing until a Murriner 
force attacked Earth, it could 
then pick off the" Murriners as 
and how it liked, where it liked, 
when it liked. 

Since the whole campaign was 
one of fleet maneuvers, anything 
that could be found out about 
those movements was in itself a 
victory. And at this the Murriners 
were leading easily. After all, to 
even a fifth -generation Murriner 
— that was as far as it went yet 
— everything Terran was famil- 
iar, and Earth was a second home. 
All the books were about Earth, 
the language was the same, Mur- 
riner cities were copies of Terran 
cities. A Murriner, save for the 
small physical differences, was a 
natural spy to send secretly to 
Earth. 

Terrans, on the other hand, 
could know little about Murrane. 
It was changing rapidly, while 
Earth stayed the same. Informa- 
tion was scanty instead of abun- 
dant. An untrained Terran on 
Murrane would betray himself 
in five minutes, while an untrain- 
ed Murriner on Earth was safely 
mingling with the crowd and 
learning what he needed to know. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



VF/HAT had been forgotten, for 
™ the umpteenth time, was 
'hat from the moment a man 
«-nt to a colony he was a colon- 
t. not a Terran. The colony, 
. herever it was, was his home. 
Vo go there at all, he must have 
preferred the colony to Earth. He 
was a malcontent or a pioneer, 
Before any quarrel started, his 
side in it was fixed. 

Another thing was that Earth 
couldn't help underestimating 
Murrane. That had happened, 
was happening, and would con- 
tinue to happen. The Terran 
Command was getting over that 
error, but the people of Venus, 
Earth and Mars probably never 
would. They underestimated 
Murrane in many respects, but 
the main one was man-power. 
Knowing that Earth alone could 
swallow the whole population of 
Murrane in one country, they 
shrugged off the whole question 
of possible victory for the Colony, 
They forgot that only a tiny 
proportion of Earth’s potential 
could be used, and that for the 
most part Earth’s billions con- 
sidered that their duty in the 
matter ended with reading the 
newspapers. 

Not much was made in the 
books of the physical differences 
between Terra ns and the Colon- 
ists, Muriel noticed. Probably 
unimportant. They certainly 
weren’t the cause of the conflict. 



When she came to the ques- 
tion of how all this concerned 
her, the answer was surprisingly 
simple. 

It didn’t. 

Or didn’t seem to. 

At New York, Peter took 
Muriel straight to the Security 
building. 

“This isn’t my section at all, of 
course,” he said, “but I’m going 
to see if I can get permission to 
follow this thing through to the 
end. Mind?” 

She didn’t answer that. She 
certainly didn't object to Peter 
staying around, but what exactly 
to say to him, in the circum- 
stances, was a puzzle she couldn’t 
solve. 

VII 

A FTER days of exhaustive 
tests, a nameless director at 
the Security building told Muriel : 
“I don't think you can possibly 
be an agent of ours sent to Mur- 
rane, Miss Martin.” 

“Allowing for all possible sur- 
gical and medical transforma- 
tion?” asked Peter, who had been 
there most of the time. He had 
been given permission to continue 
the investigation of the strange 
case of Muriel Martin. 

“Allowing for all possible 
change and about twenty per 
cent over the top, for luck. I’m 
not going to give the figures, even

to you, fcaptain Clark, but you 
can imagine that the number of 
women agents we send to Mur- 
rane is small. And of the women 
who have been landed on Mur- 
rane, we can definitely account 
for a fair number. You are in 
some way or another disqualified 
from being any one of the re- 
mainder.” 

“Can you put some sort of per- 
centage of probability on it?” 
Peter asked. “I mean, there are 
strong improbabilities already in 
Miss Martin’s case. If we are 
ever to find out anything, we’ll 
probably have to accept some im- 
probability or other,” 

“I should say the chances 
against Miss Martin having been 
an agent of ours,” said the direc- 
tor, “would be about five hun- 
dred to one.” 

Peter rose. “We’ll have to see 
if we can find a better chance 
than that, Muriel/’ he said. 
“Thanks, director.’* 

Something more definite was 
provided by the first electronic 
psychiatrist they visited. He was 
prepared to state definitely that 
electronic psychiatry had been 
used. 

“Just taking the patterns of 
what you know and what you 
don’t, Miss Martin,” he said, 
“they’re too neat and definite to 
be the result of any kind of men- 
tal illness. But . .” 

He stared thoughtfully at Mu- 



riel, then at Peter — who wasn’t in 
uniform — and back to Muriel. 

“This is certainly a criminal 
case,” he said bluntly. “You 
would hardly have permitted 
anything of this sort, Miss Mar- 
tin. I suggest you go to the po- 
lice, for your own safety. Any- 
one who went to the trouble of — ” 

Peter showed him his badge. 
“If you feel you must report on 
this, doctor,” he said, “please 
report to Security, not to the 
civil police.” 

“I see,” said the psychiatrist. 
“I suggest you consult Dr. Hy- 
neker. You understand, elec- 
tronic psychiatry is a new branch. 
I’m a practitioner, not one of the 
founders of the science. Dr, 
Hyneker or Dr. Ball may be able 
to help you further, where I 
can't.” 

So they went to see Dt. Hy- 
neker. 

VIII 

D R. Hyneker was curiously like 
the psychiatrist they had 
seen on Venus. He gave the same 
impression of being a machine 
himself, as if this new branch of 
science was actually turning men 
into quick, jerky, shrewd -eyed 
machines. 

They told him as little as pos- 
sible, to see what he could find 
out for himself. Rather surpris- 
ingly, the thing he picked out 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



mid concentrated on was Muriel’s 
disinclination to go to Murrane. 

“Before your own conclusions 
can be trusted, Miss Martin,” 
he observed, arranging and re- 
arranging papers on his desk, 
“you must remove this fixation.” 
“That’s interesting, but how do 
I do it?" Muriel asked, smiling. 
“Go to Murrane.” 

Muriel had got over trembling 
with fright or bursting into tears 
whenever the idea was mentioned. 
But she frowned, still not liking 
it. 

Peter shot a glance at her, and 
spoke for her. “Quite so, doctor," 
he observed, “but how would you 
suggest she do it?” 

The doctor took a sheaf of 
papers from the bottom of a 
pile and began to deal them out 
on the desk like a pack of cards. 

“I admit the suggestion, at the 
moment, is somewhat impractic- 
able,” he said. “However, often 
we psychiatrists must be imprac- 
tical. Someone comes in and I 
examine him and find the only 
real solution to his problem is 
for him to become a great vio- 
linist. But perhaps he has no 
talent whatever. What do I do?" 

He sighed. “Long ago I de- 
cided that where people appeared 
to be reasonably intelligent and 
stable, the thing to do was to tell 
them the answer, however impos- 
sible it seemed. Last year I told 
a man to go home and beat his 



wife. I was quite certain, I must 
admit, that he would never be 
able to do it. Apparently I was 
wrong. They’re now very happy 
and contented together.” 

TTE collected together the pa- 
pers he had dealt out and 
began to fan them out like a 
bridge hand. “I do this, for ex- 
ample, because I want to pile 
all these papers together and set 
fire to the lot. Impossible — by 
my own decision. So I relieve my 
feelings by controlling them, de- 
stroying their significance, then 
restoring it.” 

“But just a minute, doctor,” 
said Muriel. “I* haven’t come 
here as a patient, not in the 
normal sense. I don’t really want 
to be cured of anything, because 
I’m not aware of anything rad- 
ically wrong. Except for my 
memory, and I’m told I can't 
have that back because there's 
nothing there. All I want is to 
find out what happened to me. 
To know.” 

Dr. Hyneker’s eyes opened 
wide. “But obviously you can 
only find that on Murrane,” he 
said chidingly, as if she should 
have known that. 

“What!” exclaimed Peter. 

“Of course.” He still seemed 
astonished that what he said 
wasn’t obvious. “Here we have a 
fairly neat removal "of certain 
memories, and over all — very

untidy — a threat, a positive 
prohibition against going to Mur- 
rane The job as a whole is ex- 
tremely amateurish — other things, 
like your conditioned disinterest 
in the Earth -Murrane war, make 
it clear that you were not sup- 
posed to know that Murrane was 
concerned at all. But obviously, 
from this artificial respect and 
fear and warning this — this un- 
tidy blot over the good work 
that preceded it, Murrane is the 
key to the whole thing, and if 
you ever want to find an answer, 
you must go there.” 

He shuffled the papers in his 
hand. Muriel observed auto- 
matically that they were getting 
rather crumpled and dog-eared 
by this time. 

“I’m sorry/’ he said in a differ- 
ent tone, “that it’s impossible for 
you to go to Murrane, Miss Mar- 
tin. Yours is a very interesting 
case. I should like to see it re- 
solved in some way.” 

Peter was about to speak, but 
Muriel waved him silent. From 
the expression on his face, he 
didn’t appear to have anything 
very helpful to say. 

“You mean if I were to go to 
Murrane,” she said slowly, “I’d 
know, just because of that, what 
this was all about?” 

“Possibly, It may be more diffi- 
cult than that If I say more, I’m 
guessing . " . is that understood? 
Very well, then: After the treat- 



ment I and others, apparently, 
have given you, you may take it 
that merely by returning to Mur- 
rane — ** 

"Returning/” Peter shouted. 
“You’re sure of that?” 

T^|R. Hyneker turned a pained 
countenance on him. “This 
isn’t recognized behavior for a 
psychiatrist’s consulting room, 
young man,” he observed. “If 
you don’t restrain yourself, I 
shall have to continue this dis- 
cussion with Miss Martin alone. 

“I took the fact that you have 
been there before for granted,” 
he went on, to Muriel. “As I was 
saying, you may take it that 
merely by returning to Murrane 
you will probably, by this time, 
break down the fixation com- 
pletely. You will then, as far as 
I can see, be wholly rational, in 
the loose way we generally use 
the term. Going to Murrane 
guarantees nothing else. But it 
would probably open up at once 
some knowledge of the world 
which would show you definitely 
that you had previously been 
there. And that knowledge might 
even make it clear to you where 
to look further. There wouldn’t 
be so definite a prohibition 
against something, if disregard- 
ing the prohibition wasn’t liable 
to produce something — ” 

“Of course,” said Peter. He had 
himself in control now, and spoke 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



quite calmly. “Muriel, all this 
makes sense/’ 

“But I can’t possibly — ” 
“Doctor,” said Peter. “Suppose 
we merely landed her on some 
quiet, unoccupied spot on Mur- 
rane and took her off again. 
Would that — ?” 

“We?” said the doctor. 

Again Peter had to show his 
badge. 

“I don’t know,” said Dr. Hy- 
neker. “The only way to find out 
would be to try. I doubt it. Miss 
Martin would probably have to 
make closer contact with the life 
and conditions of Murrane than 
that before anything very re- 
markable would happen.” 

Then, carelessly, he threw an- 
other small bombshell. “If you 
by any chance do go to Mur- 
rane, Miss Martin,” he said, “I’d 
advise you to be very careful 
about visiting a town called 
Rillan, and particularly a Dr. 
James Ball who lives there. Be- 
cause, much as I hate to say it, 
I fear that whatever was done to 
you must have been done by him 
or under his direction,” 

IX 

JT1HEY asked him all he knew 
about James Ball, but he 
waved that aside. “I haven’t seen 
him for years,” he said. “He’s 
done most of his work on Mur- 
rane.” 



“A Murriner?” asked Peter. 
“Depends what you mean by 
a Murriner. He chooses to work 
there, on what he calls the funda- 
mental problems of psychiatry. 
The removal of your personal 
memories might have been his 
work, Miss Martin. The rest is 
rather clumsy for a man of his 
skill. I should have doubted 
whether he’d turn against Earth 
— but then, he’s lived on Mur- 
rane for some time. If you want 
further information on Dr. Ball, 
I’m not the one to give it. There’s 
a daughter, I think, here in New 
York. Go and see her.” 

So Muriel and Peter found 
themselves on the move again. 
Peter wanted to talk about what 
Dr. Hyneker had said, but Muriel 
made it clear that she didn’t. He 
bore it until they were within a 
block of the address Dr. Hyneker 
had given them. Then he caught 
Muriel’s arm and stopped her. 

“Let’s* try to work this out, 
Muriel,” he said. “If this Dr. 
Ball was the man who worked 
on your brain — ” 

“I think he must be,” said 
Muriel thoughtfully. “I remem- 
ber Rillan. I've been there, I’m 
sure. But what harm can it do 
to see Barbara Ball? She can’t 
very well be in touch with Mur- 
rane.” 

“That’s one thing to find out 
first. Wait here while I ring 
Security.”

He disappeared into a drug- 
store. He ‘was gone only a few 
minutes. He came back looking 
thoughtful. 

“Security say they’ve been 
watching her for a long time. 
She was at school here when the 
war started — -there isn’t much 
schooling on Murrane, of course, 
and Barbara was only there for 
a year when she was fourteen. 
The rest of the time she’s been 
on Earth. Since the war, it seems 
she’s been moving heaven and 
earth to get herself into Security 
as an agent on Murrane. They 
have nothing against her, but re- 
fused her at first because she 
was too young, and now because 
she’s probably more concerned 
about joining up with her father 
again than working for Earth. 

“But,” he went on, “it seems 
there’s another daughter, Lorna, 
with Dr. Ball at Rillan. What 
do you think of that?” 

“Should I think anythfng about 
that?” she asked, puzzled. 

Peter didn’t insist on the idea. 
“Oh, well, let’s go and see Bar- 
bara.” 

T>ARBARA was nineteen, very 
small, rather dark-skinned, 
and would have been called 
pretty only by someone deter- 
mined to see the best in her. It 
would have been in order, how- 
ever, to call her attractive — she 
had quite a neat figure, rather on 



the thin side, and thick dark hair 
with a luster which many a 
prettier girl would envy. 

Peter showed her his card at 
once, knowing she would co- 
operate all she could with a 
Security Officer. She did. She 
invited them into a surprisingly 
expensive -looking lounge with 
every evidence of excitement. 

“I don’t want to disappoint 
you, Miss Ball,” said Peter. 
“We’re not here about your ap- 
plication to go to Murrane. That’s 
not my department at all. We 
want to ask you some questions 
about your father and — Lorna.” 
She was disappointed; it was 
inevitable. Apparently she had 
set her mind on going to Murrane, 
She blinked and smiled brightly, 
but Muriel wasn't deceived. She 
patted Barbara's knee sympa- 
thetically. 

“Pity you and I can’t do a 
switch, Barbara,” she said. “You 
want to go to Murrane, and ev- 
erybody’s trying to make me go 
there, but I don’t want to.” 
“Careful, Muriel,” said Peter 
quietly. “No, it’s not that we 
don’t trust you, Miss Ball. But 
there may be something very im- 
portant behind this ...” 

He put some questions about 
Dr. Ball and Lorna. Dr. Ball, it 
seemed, was about fifty, and had 
been a medical doctor for some 
time before he heard of electronic 
psychiatry. He’d moved into that

branch right at the beginning, and 
soon, with Dr. Hyneker, was the 
leading authority on it. He went 
to Murrane because, he said, on 
Earth you couldn’t see the trees 
for the forest. The environment 
of a psychiatrist’s patients was 
so complicated that he could nev- 
er see the effect of any one item. 
In a colony, life was so compara- 
tively simple that it was possible 
to trace things, really cure things 
which on Earth could only be 
alleviated. He had started his 
own school there, experimenting 
and training electronic psychia- 
trists. 

“You seem to know the back- 
ground pretty well. Miss Ball,” 
said Peter. 

OHE shook her head impatient - 
^ ly. “I’m the dunce of the fam- 
ily,” she said. 

Lorna had also been at school 
in New York, but five years ago, 
when Barbara was fourteen, she 
had gone to Murrane. Barbara 
had been left in the general 
charge of an aunt — actually, on 
her own. 

“Pop believes in people having 
to look after themselves early,” 
said Barbara. 

Lorna had been brilliant. At 
school and college she had done 
pretty well in everything, refus- 
ing to specialize. She did enough 
electronic psychiatry to know her 
way around the subject, but only 



from the psychological side. She 
kept off medicine and concen- 
trated on chemistry. 

Peter stopped Barbara when 
she was in the middle of her de- 
scription of Lorna. 

“Have you a picture?” he 
asked. 

“Of Lorna? Sure, on the table 
beside you.” 

Peter looked at it closely. It 
was rather a shock, in two ways. 
He passed it on to Muriel, who 
merely glanced at it casually and 
put it back on the table. 

Apparently Peter’s idea wasn’t 
going to strike Muriel at all. 

“Miss Ball,” he said slowly, 
“let’s suppose that on Murrane 
for some reason Lorna was 
changed physically so that she 
became completely different — so 
that appearance was nothing to 
go by. Suppose all her personal 
memories were removed, so that 
she didn’t know anything that 
had ever happened to her, any- 
one she had ever met. But sup- 
pose also that her general knowl- 
edge, the memories that had 
nothing to do with Lorna Ball 
personally, were carefully split 
off and only lightly covered up. 
Supposing all that — how would 
you know that Muriel here wasn’t 
your sister Lorna?” 

Muriel wasn’t much affected 
by the idea Peter suggested one 
way or the other. 

But Barbara jumped, went

white, and stared at Muriel. 

“She cartt be . she mur- 
mured. “Lorna’s no glamor girl. 
And she — ” 

She was troubled by the two 
things that Peter had noticed 
about the picture. Lorna wasn’t 
ugly, but at best she was merely 
a pie as ant -looking girl. One 
would say she looked intelligent, 
which was true, and avoid alto- 
gether the question, of whether 
she was pretty or not. 

The other thing was that Lorna 
and Muriel were so obviously 
different, beauty apart, that one 
didn’t look for similarities. It 
was like comparing an orange 
and an apple. Girls much more 
like each other would still have 
been obviously different people. 

Barbara, though she called 
herself the dunce of the family, 
wasn’t stupid. And she had imag- 
ination. Her gifts seemed to lie 
all in that direction, in fact. She 
was an artist bom to a scientist: 
the intelligence was there, but 
instead of being calculating intel- 
ligence it was talent, apparently. 
A volume of Beethoven sonatas 
lay on the piano; the water- 
colors hung on the walls were 
probably hers, and Peter wouldn’t 
have been surprised to learn she 
wrote, too. 

Barbara soon got over the 
plain difficulties of the matter 
and began to consider the ques- 
tion seriously. 



CJHE asked Muriel questions on 
^ subjects Lorjia knew, and ap- 
parently threw in a few on sub- 
jects Lorna didn’t know. Pres- 
ently, her own knowledge being 
deficient, she armed herself with 
an encyclopedia. Muriel wasn’t 
often sure; she usually answered 
hesitantly. Sometimes Barbara 
helped her, giving part of the 
answer to see if Muriel could 
supply the rest. As a rule she 
could. 

Barbara naturally enough tried 
for other memories now and 
then — people Lorna had known, 
things she had done, places she 
had visited. Sometimes something 
came out about the places, but 
nothing on the other things. 

“Have you a scar on your left 
thigh?” Barbara asked. 

“I don’t think so.” 

“Marks like that wouldn’t be 
left,” Peter put in. “There would 
be no point in the other changes, 
if Lorna could be identified by a 
simple thing like a scar.” 

Nevertheless, Muriel rolled 
down her stocking and Barbara 
looked closely at the skin. There 
was a very faint mark which 
might have been a scar, 

“They didn’t make it easy for 
us, did they?” asked Muriel, 
amused. She was still far less 
concerned about the whole affair 
than Peter and Barbara. 

“Don’t you care?” Barbara 
asked. 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Of course I care, but — -well, 
after all, I must be someone. It 
doesn’t seem to matter such a 
tremendous amount who I am, if 
you see what I mean. If I’m Lor- 
na Ball, fine. If not, I won’t be 
heartbroken.” 

Barbara looked at Muriel’s 
teeth. 

A back tooth was missing that 
Barbara didn’t know about. 

“Perhaps there was something 
unusual about it,” suggested 
Peter. 

“There was,” Barbara said, 
with some evidence of excitement. 
“It was the only one that was 
filled. Either Loma got it out 
since, or they took it out because 
it could be identified from dental 
photographs — ” 

“Then you’re certain I’m 
Lorna?” 

“No, not certain Whoever did 
this made sure I couldn’t be cer- 
tain. There’s nothing conclusive. 
You don’t know things Loma 
definitely did know. You do 
know things Lorna hadn’t stud- 
ied, to my knowledge. But al- 
lowing for all that — I think you’re 
my sister.” 

Tt/T URIEL said slowly, “Even if 
j wanted to go to Murrane 
I couldn’t.” 

“Perhaps you could,” said 
Peter quietly, watching her close- 
ly. 

“How?” 



“Through Security. The route 
Barbara has been trying to take.” 

Muriel looked at Barbara. “If 
they won’t let her go, why should 
they let me?” 

It was Barbara who answered 
that. “If you’re Lorna,” she said, 
“they’ll let you go. Terran agents 
have to know Murrane and be 
able to act like Murriners. They 
don’t think I can. They’ve tested 
me twice. I’m quiet, dreamy and 
even-tempered, and I should be 
reckless, hasty and extrovert, or 
able to act that way.” She frown- 
ed, then admitted honestly: “I 
can’t, I guess. But you’re dif- 
ferent. Try Security and see.” 

Muriel fought a sharp, silent 
battle with herself. She could be 
quite happy without ever know- 
ing for sure who she was — and it 
would be dangerous to go to Mur- 
rane as a spy. She didn’t think 
of it as more than that: danger- 
ous. She was quite confident of 
being able to pass among Mur- 
riners as one of them — it seemed 
like the kind of thing she could 
do. 

But why? 

Why take such a risk when it 
didn’t matter? She didn’t really 
care much about what had been 
done to her. She didn’t want re- 
venge. And she still trembled in- 
wardly at the thought of going to 
Murrane. 

Yet what really mattered 
seemed to be this: she did want

37 



to know more. This was a way 
in which she might learn. 

“Peter,” she said abruptly, “am 
I free? Do you trust me? Do I 
have to go to Murrane?” 

Peter took her hand and press- 
ed it affectionately. 

“Let’s take them in order, 
baby,” he said. “Are you free? 
Sure. You have always been. 
Perhaps Security should be as 
tough as it’s supposed to be, and 
kill on suspicion. But it isn’t. 
Maybe that’s why we’re losing 
the war. It gives the benefit of 
the doubt, and you know there’s 
so much doubt that Security 
can’t ever touch you. Do I trust 
you? That’s not so easy. Trust 
has to be both ways. If you trust 
me, maybe you can see the an- 
swer to that.” 

Muriel returned the pressure 
warmly. “I like that,” she said. 
“I always knew you were a nice 
guy, Peter, even when you were 
acting like a screen villain. Only 
a good guy would say a thing 
like that. But you didn’t answer 
the last question.” 

“Do you have to go to Mur- 
rane? No ... I didn’t. Only you 
can answer that, Muriel.'* 

X 

OOD luck, Muriel,” said 
^ Peter. “And — come back, 
will you?” 

Muriel had let him kiss her 



before, but this time she kissed 
him. Then she left the helicopter 
and struck out for the distant 
glow of the city. 

She was a little light-headed. 
She was deliberately not think- 
ing of her fear of going to Mur- 
rane, and the fact that she was 
now on it. There was also the 
danger that would be with her 
every second of the time she was 
on the world: the danger of be- 
ing discovered as a Ter ran spy. 
And, curiously, the two fears 
seemed to cancel each other out. 

The ship which had brought 
her would stay in the vicinity. 
She didn’t know where — she 
hadn’t been told, in case she 
should be discovered and inter- 
rogated. Peter and Barbara were 
aboard it, and every three days 
Peter would drop in the helicop- 
ter to the same spot to see if she 
were ready to go back yet or had 
anything to report. 

The ship wouldn’t be discov- 
ered. A single ship could seldom 
be detected in space, unless it 
was moving fast. Almost all the 
devices for detecting the presence 
of other spaceships were based 
on the increase of mass with ve- 
locity. The faster a ship went, 
the more chance it had of getting 
through a waiting fleet — and the 
more certain it was to be detect- 
ed. The slower it went, the safer 
it was from detection of that 
kind; but if it should be spotted 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



by eyes or radar it was a dead 
duck, with no acceleration built 
up. 

No, Muriel’s line of escape was 
safe enough; all the danger was 
on Murrane itself. 

It was the beginning of the long 
night of Murrane, and she had 
been landed between Felter and 
Ederton. The answers she wanted 
were probably all to be found in 
Rillan, a hundred and fifty miles 
to the south, but she hadn’t dared 
go there at once. For all she 
knew, perhaps everyone in Rillan 
would recognize her. 

A S she walked, she pondered 
about how familiar this world 
was to her. She had had the nor- 
mal training of any Terran who 
was sent to Murrane as a spy, 
yet she hadn’t been thinking of 
that when she was careful not to 
touch the low branches of the 
Murriner pines. No, there was no 
doubt that she was familiar with 
Murrane. It had" been obvious 
during her training by Security. 

She didn’t think anything had 
been said about Murriner pines 
at night in the training she had 
had from Security. Murrane had 
once been warmer; many of its 
plants spent their lives grasping 
for heat, from any source. Any 
animal or man who blundered 
into a pine, particularly, was 
liable to be clutched and held, if 
he wasn’t strong and nimble, and 



drained of his body heat. He 
might be alive at morning, if he 
had enough vitality; but prob- 
ably not. Certainly not if the 
morning was thirty-eight hours 
away. 

She walked on through the 
hard snow, adjusting herself. to 
the environment. Murrane's three 
moons, all of them risen at the 
moment, gave about the same il- 
lumination as a full moon on 
Earth. 

She wore a black snowsuit, 
plain but neatly cut. It covered 
everything but her face, hands 
and feet. On her feet were fur- 
lined boots; long gloves covered 
her hands and the sleeves of her 
suit. Under the snowsuit she 
wore a similar but finer white 
coverall, and under that a thin 
sweater and pantaloons. All this 
would come off when she went 
inside. Below this was the indoor 
dress, creaseless slacks and a 
sweater. Any sins of the flesh 
committed on Murrane .weren’t 
caused by seeing too much of it. 

She stopped as a call sounded 
behind her. She wasn’t frighten- 
ed; she was rather glad that her 
first meeting with a Murriner 
should be like this, alone, in the 
open, at night. Women on Mur- 
rane had nothing to fear from 
such encounters — the penalties 
for all kinds of sex crime were 
too severe. 

She couldn’t see any more of 



MIND ALONE 



39 



the man who came up to her 
than he could of her — a few 
square inches of face above a 
bulky figure. 

“Oh — a girl!’* he exclaimed in 
some surprise. “You’re late on 
this road, aren’t you?” 

Already there were slight phys- 
ical changes; soon there would 
be a distinctive Murriner accent, 
then a dialect. There was no 
radio communication between 
Earth and Murrane, of course, 
nor would there ever be. That 
meant that any change in pro- 
nunciation would be a divergence. 

“Yes, I’m later than I meant to 
be,” said Muriel, in the same ac- 
cent. “I thought I’d make Felter 
an hour ago.” 

They walked on together. 

“Looking for a job?” asked the 
Murriner. 

Terran Intelligence, poor as it 
was, could at least be trusted to 
give its operatives a sound identi- 
ty and purpose. "Yes,” said Mur- 
iel, “they need chemists at the 
factory. 5 ’ 

“Where are you from?” 

“Rillan,” she told him. 

“Why leave Rillan for a little 
place like this?” 

“Rillan’s gone all psychiatric 
and biological. This looks as if 
it’s going to be the place for 
chemists.” 

“You’re smart,” said the Mur- 
riner, after considering that. 
“What’s your name?” 



Muriel gave him her third iden- 
tity — Thelma Bittner. 

“Glad to meet you. I’m Bill 
Seuter. Say, I used to work in 
Rillan. They still got that old 
ship in the square?” 

Muriel turned her head to stare 
at him. “Ship? Square?” 

“Sure, the museum piece. Used 
to pass it every day.” 

OHE hadn’t remembered much 
^ about Rillan, but a few vague 
pictures came up as he spoke. 
More than enough for her to' 
say: “Not in Rillan you didn’t. 
No offense — you think I’m a Ter- 
ran spy, perhaps?” 

Seuter laughed. “We check on 
anyone who arrives in a place. 
That’s enough. We don’t make 
many mistakes.” 

“ ‘We’?” 

“I’m in Counter-espionage.” 
“Oh. You check on people even 
before they get to Felter?” 

“Sometimes. I don’t follow any 
fixed routine,” said Seuter com- 
placently, “but I don’t miss 
much. You’re all right. When we 
get where it’s warmer, remind me 
and I’ll give you a CE pass for 
Felter.” 

* Security didn’t know anything 
about CE passes. 

“Thanks,” said Muriel. “But, 
say . how could you tell I’m 
all right? Just because I know 
there’s no ship in the square at 
Rillan?” 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Nope,” said Seuter, still com- 
placent. “Fact is, Earth and Mur- 
tane are growing apart every 
minute. I don’t need to run lab 
tests on you, even if I knew how. 
T alking for five minutes is 
enough.” 

He would be right, too, Muriel 
thought — except with someone 
like her who had actually lived 
on Murrane. 

“Find many?” she asked. 

“Three a month. I spend a lot 
of time on roads outside towns 
and pick up people like you.’* 

They had reached the town. No 
snow lay there; Murrane had 
only electric power, but there was 
any amount of that. It was be- 
cause there was only electric 
power that people had to do so 
much walking between towns. 
Electric power wasn’t much good 
for the heavy vehicles that would 
be needed to force their way 
through the drifts and ice, and 
instead, an electric railway sys- 
tem was being gradually extend- 
ed, Muriel hadn’t had to explain 
that she had gone by train from 
Rillan to Ederton and walked on 
to Felter — that would be taken 
for granted. 

Seuter gave her a pass, saluted 
her with a wave of his hand and 
went back to patrol the roadway- 
Muriel looked after him thought- 
fully. Because of him, three Ter- 
rans would be identified and shot 
in the next month or so. But he 



was only doing his job, and doing 
it well. She liked him. Sometimes 
one met someone for only a few 
minutes, said only a few words 
and then parted, but felt as if 
one had made a friend. It was 
like that with Seuter. 

She hoped desperately that she 
would find what she was looking 
for, and that it would end this 
senseless war. Surely if it could 
only be stopped soon Earth 
would have the sense never to 
make the same mistakes again, 
whatever they were, and Mur- 
rane would know better than to 
fight a war for freedom that had 
never really been denied. 

Suddenly she realized that she 
hadn’t been afraid since she set 
foot on Murrane. 

XI 

S HE got the job. On Murrane, 
so far, there was no system 
of qualifications and references. 
They tried you in a job, and if 
you did it well, you were in. 

In the first few days she saw 
how easy it was for anyone who 
knew Murrane well to pass as a 
Murriner, and how utterly im- 
possible it was for anyone who 
didn’t. 

The physical differences were 
nothing — absolutely nothing. 
What mattered was whether you 
were a Murriner or not. Earth 
was flooding Murrane with op- 



MIND ALONE 



41 



eratives who weren't, and they 
stood out like sore thumbs. Muri- 
el saw one of them. She couldn’t 
do anything about him. He was 
obviously being left alone for the 
moment, carefully watched, no 
doubt, to see what he would do. 

How could Security hope to 
train agents? What they needed 
wasn’t the right knowledge, but 
the right attitude. That couldn’t 
be learned in New York. 

She met Seuter again a few 
days later at the factory. He was 
there checking on the other new 
chemists. 

“Say!” he said when he saw 
her, “if f’d seen more of you that 
night I’d have stayed with you 
longer.” 

“I thought so too,” she admit- 
ted frankly. “I’m not usually 
dropped as quickly as that.” 

“Why aren’t you married?” he 
asked bluntly. 

“Because Tm a chemist. 
There’s no romance in chemis- 
try.” 

“There’s one chemist I could 
go for.’* 

She held up her hand in pro- 
test. “No,” she said, “not a CE 
man. Someone will shoot you 
some day. I’m not going to mar- 
ry anyone who’s going to be 
shot.” 

But that raised another prob- 
lem. In frontier country there are 
always more men than women. 
The women on Murrane were 



very quickly married. At twenty - 
five, on Murrane, a healthy, pret- 
ty girl who was unmarried was 
an enigma to everyone. Muriel 
would have to do her job in a 
hurry, before anyone became 
puzzled enough to be suspicious. 

Every three days, she knew, 
Peter was landing his little shell 
of a helicopter in the same spot 
to take her away if she was ready. 

Ready! She hadn’t even start- 
ed. 

Working on the basis that the 
secret she was looking for was 
psychiatric or anthropological, 
she studied the Murriners around 
her not individually but in the 
mass. Nothing suggested itself. 
They were different from Terrans, 
of course, but such differences as 
she saw were known or guessed 
on Earth. 

T HEY were aggressive -defen- 
sive, as Peter had once said. 
They boasted of how much better 
they were than Terrans, and se-. 
cretly believed the opposite. 
They were reckless, brave, with 
a fine disregard for male life. 
Women weren’t allowed to be 
brave, however. They were too 
valuable for the young Murriners 
they could produce. Murriners in 
general were less intelligent than 
Terrans, more ready to take 
chances, more quarrelsome, more 
immature, more generous, more 
vital. 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



But all that was known. What 
-vas it that wasn't known? 

She saw nothing of anyone who 
was actually engaged in fighting 
-no space -navy men, no ammu- 
nition dumps, no military depots, 
or, in fact, anything whatever 
that was connected with the war. 
She was very careful not to. That 
was bound to be a dangerous line 
of investigation. The regular Ter- 
ran agents would be working on 
that problem, and succeeding 
moderately or failing completely, 
as usual. 

She was pretty certain, more- 
over, that what she wanted 
wasn’t to be found under the 
heading of normal military in- 
formation. 

Only when others introduced 
the subject did she even talk 
about the war. The usual atti- 
tude was about what she expect- 
ed. Her fellow- workers had no 
very clear idea of what was going 
on, or why it was going on; but 
they were naturally, tempera- 
mentally in favor of a war against 
Earth. To most of them, the is- 
sue was plain — Murrane was 
teaching Earth a lesson. Earth 
was being shown that you 
couldn’t push Murriners around. 
They knew, most of them, that 
there was more to it than that. 
But that was policy — none of 
their business. 

After two weeks of merely be- 
ing an ordinary Murriner chem- 



ist, Muriel decided that she 
would have to risk visiting Ril- 
lan. Dr. Hyneker was probably 
right. The secret would be there. 
It certainly didn’t appear to be 
in Felter. She had seen nothing 
that seemed worthwhile even try- 
ing to follow up. 

She told Seuter she was going 
back to pick up some things. 

"Made up your mind to stay, 
baby?” he said. “Fine. I’m still 
hoping to change your mind 
about CE men.” 

“You might at that,*’ said 
Muriel encouragingly. "I haven’t 
known many. And maybe it’ll be 
a long time before someone 
shoots you.” 

XII 

TVT URIEL was quite well aware 
that it was dangerous. Rath- 
er than scratch cautiously along 
the edges of the affair, however, 
she marched straight up to 17 
Third Street, rang the bell and 
asked the woman who came to 
the door if Dr. James Ball lived 
there. 

“Not now,” said the woman, 
apparently unsuspicious. “I don’t 
know where he went.” 

“Can you tell me anyone who 
might?” 

The woman considered. 
“There’s Joe Cruickshank at 
number 14,” she said. “He used 
to be a friend of the doctor.” 



MIND ALONE 



43 



Muriel thanked her and cross- 
ed the street to number 14. 

Joe Cruickshank was an oldish 
man with very heavy black 
brows. When Muriel mentioned 
Dr. Ball he drew them together 
in a dark frown, almost hiding 
his eyes. 

“You a friend of his?” he de- 
manded. “Or maybe a friend of 
his daughter?" 

Despite the signs, Muriel 
thought the best answer was, 
“Yes.” 

“You want to know what hap- 
pened to him?” 

“And Lorn a.” 

He hesitated; then said abrupt- 
ly, “Come in,” and turned away 
without waiting to see if she was 
following him. 

There was nothing luxurious 
about the sitting-room into which 
he led her, but in a simple way it 
was very comfortable. An elec- 
tric fire was set into one wall; 
otherwise it was like a sitting- 
room in a country cottage on 
Earth circa 1880. Cruickshank 
sat heavily on a rocking-chair 
and motioned Muriel to an arm- 
chair on the other side of the fire. 

“Who are you?” he demanded. 

Muriel didn’t want to give any 
of her three names. It was still 
not proven that she was Lorn a 
Ball, and in any case she clearly 
couldn’t give that name. If the 
theory she was working on was 
correct, she had been named 



Muriel Martin on Murrane, prob- 
ably in Rillan, and that was 
equally undesirable as a name to 
give. And though Thelma Bitt- 
ner had gone back to Rillan quite 
openly, she didn’t want Thelma 
Bittner to be known as having 
shown interest in James and 
Lorna Ball. 

S O she gave a fourth name, and 
a few brief details to satisfy 
Cruickshank. She had plenty of 
information that she could use 
to prove she had known Lorna 
well. 

“And you don’t know anything 
about what happened to them?” 
asked Cruickshank. 

“No. Nothing.” 

“Neither does anyone else,” 
said Cruickshank bitterly, ap- 
parently deciding to trust her. 
“I think they’re both dead.” 
“Dead! Why?” 

“When the war started, Jim 
wouldn’t join CE, He wouldn’t 
have anything to do with it, or 
the war. Well, you know what 
Jim Ball has done for Murrane. 
CE might want to shoot him or 
lock him up, but most of us here 
in Rillan had other ideas. CE 
didn’t dare touch him. He went 
on working as usual, though both 
he and Lorna had to report to 
CE every second day. They 
weren’t allowed to write or re- 
ceive letters.” 

“That’s why I never got any 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



irplyl” said Muriel adroitly. 

“Jim told me one day he knew 
the real reason for the war — ” 
“Did he tell you what it was?” 
“If he had, I wouldn’t be here 
now. CE shot me full of drugs 
later, and only let me go when 
they were sure I didn’t know any- 
thing. Anyway, the day after Jim 
told me that he disappeared. So 
did Loma.” 

He breathed hard. “Some of us 
got together. CE may be spying 
on us and telling us what to do, 
but CE isn’t Murrane. We weren’t 
afraid of CE. We went along to 
the office, a whole crowd bf us, 
ready to tear the place apart. But 
they fobbed us off with some 
story — told us the doctor and 
Loma would be back in two 
weeks. So we went away.” 

Cruickshank wasn’t looking at 
her, but into the orange glow of 
the fire. ‘‘They came for me that 
night and made sure I didn’t 
know anything. They were polite 
enough, and I didn’t make an 
issue of it. 

“Two weeks later we went back 
and they told us Jim and his 
daughter had been deported to 
Earth. We didn’t believe them. 
We went all through the office, 
but there was no sign of either of 
them.” 

I'' 1 RUICK SHANK’S voice rose. 
^ “They’d been shot, that’s 
why! CE knew it couldn’t keep 



them prisoner — we’d have had 
them out in no time. Jim Ball 
was never against Murrane. 
Everyone knew that. Whatever 
CE had against them, or thought 
it had, it couldn’t bring them to 
trial. It couldn’t keep them. The 
only thing it could do was kill 
them and hide their bodies so 
that no one would ever find them. 
Well, whoever harmed Jim Ball 
or his daughter was no true Mur- 
riner, and I don’t care who .hears 
me say so! They were good 
friends to all of us!” 

He glared at Muriel as if she 
were CE itself. 

“Maybe CE told the truth,” 
said Muriel. “Maybe they were 
deported.”. 

“Would CE give Earth a man 
like Jim Ball, for free?” said 
Cruickshank derisively. “No, CE 
wouldn’t do that. CE shot them!” 

There seemed to be very little 
more Cruickshank could tell her. 
Unless . , . 

“How did Dr. Ball look when 
he told you he knew the real 
reason for the war?” she asked. 
“Happy? Sad? Disillusioned? 
Amused?” 

“None of those. Just . sur- 
prised. Sort of ‘Who’d have 
thought it?’ ” 

That was something, she 
thought. She was practically cer- 
tain, now, that she was Lorna 
Ball. 

She got one thing more from 



MIND ALONE 



45 



Joe Cruickshank — a name and 
address. It was her only lead now. 

If Cruickshank couldn’t tell 
her arty more, clearly the thing 
to do was to go to someone who 
could — whether he would or not. 
She didn’t want the local CE 
Chief or second-in-command. 
They would be too important, 
too well-guarded perhaps. They 
might also be too clever or too 
fanatic. So she had asked for the 
name of the man who rated about 
third. He must know the secret, 
and there was a better chance 
that he would be easy to get to. 

The man was Edward Voigt, 
27 Seventh Street. 

She advised Cruickshank, as 
she left, to forget that he had 
ever seen her; but he wasn’t curi- 
ous. He was sunk in his anger 
at what he believed had hap- 
pened to Jim and Lorna Ball. 

XIII 

V OIGT seemed to have been a 
good choice. His home was no 
bigger than Cruickshank’s, and 
Muriel was inside it, standing in 
the doorway of the kitchen, wait- 
ing. She had had to break a catch 
on a bedroom window, but it was 
already dark and she was sure no 
one had seen her. 

She had planned carefully; no 
further planning would help 
much. Peter would land outside 
Felter that night — she had to 



catch the train in two hours’ time 
if she didn’t mean to wait three 
days more. She wasn’t optimistic 
enough to expect to have the in- 
formation she wanted when the 
ship picked her up, but she meant 
to take this chance of getting it — 
and if she failed she’d have to 
leave Murrane anyway. 

Surely Voigt must come soon. 
He lived alone, apparently. 
Muriel had her gun #in her hand, 
silenced. She stood in the dark, 
alert for the first sound of anyone 
entering* 

At first she had been afraid he 
would come home too soon, for 
she couldn’t leave Rillan until 
the train went, and it would be 
dangerous to wait anywhere. But 
as the time slowly passed, she 
began to fear that he wouldn’t 
come home at all, or would be 
too late for her to do what she 
wanted to do and still catch the 
train. 

She had wound her scarf round 
her face. Very likely Voigt had 
seen her before. He would know 
when he saw her that she was 
Muriel Martin, who had been 
Lorna Ball. And he would know 
many more things which Muriel 
herself didn’t know. She probed 
her mind for anything she knew 
of Voigt, but there was nothing. 
There was still that curious divi- 
sion. Many things in Rillan were 
quite familiar to her, but she re- 
membered nothing that had ever 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



iuppened there. She must have 
nown Joe Cruickshank once, but 
"■ was as much a stranger to her 
is she was to him. 

At last, a key scraped in the 
>ck. Muriel tensed. The next few 
minutes would not only mean 
success or failure, but perhaps, 
quite independent of that, life or 
death. She wasn't sorry she had 
chosen this way, however. At last 
die was going to be face to face 
with someone who knew what she 
wanted. 

There was a step in the vesti- 
bule, then the light clicked on. 
Muriel stepped in from the kitch- 
en as Voigt closed the other 
door, and he saw her at once. 

“If you make a sound,” said 
Muriel softly, “I’ll shoot to kill.” 

V OIGT gasped. Muriel had ex- 
pected he would be a young 
man, ambitious, a future local 
CE Chief. But he Was old, and 
had probably climbed as high in 
the organization as he would ever 
go. She rejoiced; that was better 
still. 

“Do you want to live, Voigt?” 
she asked. “I want information. 
If you give it, no one need know 
I got it from you. If you don’t, I 
kill you and get it from someone 
else.” 

“You’re a Terranl” Voigt ex- 
claimed. 

She pulled aside her scarf. 

“Do you know now why I’m 



here?” she asked quietly. 

He went white. “Muriel Mar- 
tin,” he breathed, but she caught 
the note of interrogation he 
couldn’t keep out of it. 

“Lorna Ball,” she said evenly. 

“But you can’t know! They 
told us — ” 

“As you see, I do know.” She 
was trying to say as little as 
possible that might reveal the 
limitations of her knowledge. 
“Now, Voigt, do I get what I 
want, or do I shoot?” 

Suddenly he stiffened. “Yes, 
get it over with. You’d never let 
me live.” 

That was unfortunate. She ap- 
parently had good reasons for 
killing him. Voigt knew them, 
and she didn't. “For what I once 
knew, I may,” she said. “What 
was it that was so important you 
had to kill my father?” 

“I didn’t! You’re only guess- 
ing.” 

“Keep your voice down,” she 
murmured- From the frantic way 
he talked, how he had looked 
when he recognized her, and the 
way he had said “You’d never let 
me live,” she was almost certain 
that her father was dead, and 
that Voigt was the man who had 
actually killed him. It was a piece 
of bad luck if Voigt was the 
killer. Having no recollection of 
her father she felt no urge to 
revenge, but Voigt would never 
believe that. Her threat was

47 



weakened because he believed he 
must die anyway. 

“Listen,” she said. “I give you 
my word that if you tell me, 
I’ll tie you up and leave you un- 
hurt. What did my father find 
out?” 

He was frightened, and she was 
playing on that. A brave man 
would have laughed at her, and 
she would have been helpless. 

“I don’t know,” Voigt said 
desperately. “I didn’t understand 
it. It was too complicated.” 

Muriel shook her head. “Com- 
plicated things aren’t that im- 
portant. This is simple. You can 
tell me in one sentence.” 

She saw that he could. He 
was easy to read. She forced her- 
self to be patient. She ought to 
be able to get what she wanted 
from a man as scared of death 
as Voigt was. 

“X don’t like the idea of tor- 
ture,” she said, “but maybe it’s 
the only thing you understand, 
If I shot you two or three times 
in the stomach, you’d probably 
want me to finish you off. Would 
you rather be begging for life or 
begging for death?” 

TIE clutched the back of a 
chair to hold himself up. “We 
let you go,” he said piteously. 

“You can hardly expect me to 
be grateful. Well, what’s it to 
be?” 

“It’s mutation,” he said, his 

46 



nerve gone. The words came out 
cracked, almost unrecognizable. 
“Once we’ve mutated, we can’t 
mutate again. We can only go 
back to Earth. We’re prisoners 
here, we can’t expand, we can’t — ” 

By a strange quirk of emotion, 
he recovered his courage the in- 
stant it was too late. He flung 
himself at Muriel, his modth 
opening to shout. She shot him in 
the shoulder, thinking it would 
stop him. Instead, it made him 
wild. He thought he was dying, 
apparently, and rushed forward 
to take Muriel with him. Muriel 
shot for his legs, but he was 
pitching forward to dive at her 
knees and took the little bullet 
full in the top of his head. He 
crumpled like an old suit. 

Curiously, Muriel was ap- 
palled. It didn’t seem to matter 
that he had killed her father 
and would have killed her if he’d 
reached her. She had talked grim- 
ly of shooting him in the stomach, 
yet she was horrified at the 
thought that she had killed him. 
She bent for a moment beside 
him in the futile hope that a man. 
with a bullet through his brain 
could be merely stunned, not 
dead. 

But then what he had said 
drove other considerations from 
her mind for the moment. 

There must have been a weak- 
ness, after all, in the job CE had 
done on her. For she knew at 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



nee that what Voigt had said 
vas true — and her mind leaped 
’he gap of forgetfulness to wide, 
irsighted conclusions that it 
must have reached once before. 

She needed no more. She un- 
Urstood. She had no proof, but 
■ tie knew she could get it. 

There was a limit to the powers 
• if adaptation of those intensely 
idaptable creatures, human be- 
ngs. They would go to a new 
world and make it their home, 
md in doing so they would 
change to meet the new condi- 
tions — a little or a lot, it didn’t 
matter. They would always have 
to do that, for no world would 
ever be quite the same as Earth. 
And having changed, they lost 
some of the power to change 
again. They could go back — 
Earth itself would always be a 
refuge to them, a refuge from 
which, eventually, they could go 
out anew to other worlds, their 
power of adaptation restored. 

But Murrane was the Mur- 
riners’ prison. Cut off from Earth, 
they could never live freely, nat- 
urally, on any world but their 
own. And the Murriqers, almost 
exclusively, were restless, unsat- 
isfied, hot-blooded pioneers. 

The very thought of encircle- 
ment restriction, would be enough 
to make any Murriner fight his 
shadow, let alone the world that 
held the key to freedom. 

It was as simple as that. 

MIND ALONE 



TIER preoccupation with the 
fact that she had killed a 
man was almost her undoing at 
the station. She didn’t even no- 
tice the CE man staring at her 
closely until he spoke to her. 

“Where are you going?” he de- 
manded. 

She brought her attention back 
with a jerk. It would be tragic 
to be discovered now. 

“Ederton— for Felter,” she said, 
and fumbled in her pocket. She 
gave him Seuter’s pass. 

“What have you been doing 
here?” 

“I've been visiting a relative.” 

“Who?” 

She couldn’t give Joe Cruick- 
shank's name. In a few hour*, 
they would find the whole story 
'and shoot him as a traitor. 

“Ted Voigt,” she said boldly. 

“Oh.” His face relaxed. But 
he put one more question to make 
sure. “What kind of clock has he 
on the mantel?” 

Muriel laughed. “There isn’t a 
mantel. There’s an alarm clock 
on a little table. T^he floorcloth’s 
green and white squares.” And 
Voigt’s lying on it, she thought. 
“The curtains are dark green and 
in one corner — ” 

“All right,” said the CE man. 
“There’s your train.” 

F ROM the moment the train 
reached Ederton onwards, 
Muriel was really terrified, for the 

49 




50 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tirst time since she had landed on 
iMurrane. Now that she was so 
near leaving the planet, all the 
anxiety and nervousness and fear 
he might have felt before, but 
hadn’t, seemed to pile up in one 
ndal wave of terror. She was 
alternately cold and hot. Her legs 
u-emed about to give way and 
pitch her forward in the snow. 
She saw no one on the road, but 
she was sure that if she looked 
behind she would see a mob at 
her heels. 

When she reached the arranged 
spot and waited, she forgot all 
about the Murriner pines, and 
was pulled against the trunk of 
one before she even noticed the 
questing branch. 

Other branches swung slowly 
towards her to trap her inex- 
tricably, and already she felt the 
chill of the trunk against her 
back. She fought wildly with the 
branches that closed tightly 
across her body, crushing her ribs. 
The only way out was under — 
she got both arms against a 
branch and forced herself down, 
straining to tear her snowsuit be- 
cause it was firmly caught. Very 
slowly it gave, and branches 
rasped over her chest. 

She slid to the ground, her arms 
still trapped above her head, and 
tried to dig her heels into the 
ground to drag herself clear. The 
snow gave no purchase. 

She relaxed completely, and 



after a few long seconds the 
branches above her slackened 
very slightly. She waited, gather- 
ing her strength, then suddenly 
threw herself away from the tree 
with a heave of shoulders and 
legs. Her hands came free. 

Muriel got to her feet and stood 
gulping for air, laughing weakly 
when she found that instead of 
having two or three ribs broken, 
as had seemed likely, she wasn't 
even scratched. Her heavy cloth- 
ing had taken the brunt of the 
damage. 

But she hoped Peter would 
hurry up, for she was wet through 
and the freezing air was getting 
inside her tom clothes. The 
numbness in her side wasn’t a 
wound — it was the cold air of 
Murrane sucking warmth from 
her skin. 

As a dark shape dropped from 
the slightly less dark sky, she 
fell on the snow in a faint. 

XIV 

11/T URIEL awoke in bed aboard 
the ship, warm, dry and 
comfortable- — and obviously safe. 
She remembered dimly saying, 
“Peter, I killed a man!” and 
Peter’s cheerful, unexpected re- 
ply, “Good for you.” 

He was sitting on the bed now. 

“You didn’t put me to bed, 
did you?” she gasped. 

He grinned and nodded across

her. Muriel turned and saw Bar- 
bara, sitting and watching her. 

“Hallo, Barbara,” she said. “I 
am your sister.” 

“I know it.” 

“Dr. Ball” — it didn’t seem nat- 
ural to call him anything else — 
“Dr. Ball is dead.” 

Barbara nodded. “I guess I 
knew that too.” 

“I killed the man who did it, 
if that’s any comfort. I didn’t 
mean to do it.” 

There was a silence, and she 
knew they were waiting to hear 
whether she had succeeded or 
failed. 

“Yes, I got what I was looking 
for,” she said. She told them. 

Peter, she saw, found it very 
difficult to understand. He 
couldn’t quite see the process, or 
what it meant, or how it could 
be so important. Most particu- 
larly he couldn’t see why this, 
known only to Murrane’s CE- 
organization, should make them 
goad their people on to fight 
Earth. 

“Surely the effect would be 
just the opposite,” he said. 
“Wouldn’t they try to straighten 
out the differences with Earth 
that already- existed, so that they 
could — ” 

Muriel had been watching Bar- 
bara. “You understand, Barbara, 
don’t you?” she said. 

"I think so,” Barbara said slow- 
ly. “It’s like this, Peter. Think 



of a man and Woman crossing a 
tropical desert back on Earth. 
The man’s stronger — he carries 
the water and supplies. And after 
long, scorching days of travel, 
the woman thinks. Suppose he 
goes on and leaves me while I’m 
asleep? She knows she’ll die of 
thirst. She doesn’t dare ask to 
carry some of the water, for the 
man may refuse. She may put 
the idea of leaving her into his 
mind. So after days of this, out of 
her fear, she takes the water from 
the man while he’s asleep and 
goes on alone. Perhaps she kills 
him too, to make sure. Do you 
see?” 

TIMURIEL nodded. “That’s it. 
-L” CE is naturally suspicious, 
Peter — like some of Earth’s Se- 
curity Officers. It finds that 
Murrane is dependent on Earth. 
Murriners can’t colonize forthem- 
selves, can’t do anything but stay 
in their own hard, cold world, ex- 
cept with Earth’s gracious per- 
mission — and colonists are the 
most independent human beings 
in the Galaxy. They won’t ask 
for anything they think they 
might be able to take. So CE, 
knowing this, sets the Murriners, 
who are always ready for a fight, 
at Earth. Make Earth ask for 
terms, and demand a slice of 
Earth itself, where Murriners 
can — ” 

“Yes, I see that,” said Peter,

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



" coming excited. “But this 

<ans — ” 

‘The end of the war, anyway. 
E. always knew that. I expect 
icy guarded this secret in the 
■ >pe that they’d get what they 
anted before we found out what 
it was. And beyond that — ” 

Peter jumped up. “1*11 get us to 
curity HQ on the double!” 

He was gone. 

Muriel smiled wryly, and Bar- 
bara, seeing her smile, grinned 
too. ‘‘l*m afraid he's forgotten 
about you, Lorna,” she said teas- 
ingly. “He’s become a Security 
man again.” 

“Don’t call me Lorna,” said 
Muriel. “I stopped being Lorna 
when they took away my mem- 
ories.” 

“Couldn’t you ever get them 
back?” 

“No. You could tell me what 
happened, and I'd believe you. 
But I’d only be remembering 
what you told me, not what hap- 
pened. I’m used to being Muriel 
Martin now — I’d rather stay that 
way.” 

Presently Barbara murmured, 
“Science is often like that — ex- 
pecting something until some- 
thing else proves to be true. Isn’t 
evolution supposed to increase 
range of adaptability, not dimin- 
ish it?” 

“True — yet we can't extract 
enough oxygen from water with 
the lungs we have now, which 



our ancestors may have done 
once. No, that’s not the important 
thing about this, Barbara. Can’t 
you see it? 

“Nature often seems to have 
thought of situations that hap- 
pen to us, long before they hap- 
pen. When we’re fighting and 
killing each other, more children 
are always born than at any other 
time. And nature even seems to 
have allowed for nuclear weap- 
ons. People exposed to hard rad- 
iation just don’t have children, 
if they would be monsters. If 
children are born, they’re all 
right. If we find out from the 
genes that they wouldn’t be all 
right, we don’t have to sterilize 
anybody, for they’re sterilized al- 
ready. Hard on the individual, 
sometimes, but excellent for the 
race. 

“Now look at this. Human be- 
ings stretching out to the stars 
and adapting, necessarily, to sur- 
vive in different conditions. No 
difficulty in that. They adapt 
easily and logically. 

“But now it seems that the hu- 
man race will always be tied to 
the world that produced them. 
Isn’t that wise, too? There will 
be many worlds, many different 
peoples, some a lot more differ- 
ent from us than the Murrinera. 
But it’s still a unit, not a lot of 
units. The different peoples are 
all bound, not to each other, 
but to Earth. It’s like the spokes

53 



of a wheel. No matter what quar- 
rels there will be — and there will 
still be quarrels — nature keeps 
mankind in one unit.” 

She looked around for a wrap. 
“I’m all right. I want to get up.” 

¥~>EOPLE were rarely kept in 
bed to rest now, when they 
wanted to be active. The patient 
was at last accepted as the best 
authority on what was good for 
him — or her. Barbara produced 
a pink lace negligee. 

“That will do nicely,” she said, 
“if your Security man manages 
to get over one kind of excitement 
and comes looking for another.” 
Laughing, Muriel protested. 
Barbara grinned at her. “You 
needn’t be so restrained,” she 
said. “I've talked with him often 
enough to know you’re in no 
danger of losing his respect. For 
a Security Officer, he’s all right. 
Nail him, Muriel.” 

*‘1 still want a nice respectable 
dressing-gown.” 

Barbara sighed and produced 
one. Muriel got out of bed, steady 
enough despite a slight heaviness 
of head and a burning sensation 
where the pine branches had 
scraped her ribs. She put on the 
wrap, and when she turned Bar- 
bara was gone. 

Suppose, she thought, amused, 
that after all this I shouldn’t want 
Peter? People were taking it 
pretty much for granted. But she 



certainly didn’t mean to marry ] 
anyone until she felt a little more 1 
stable in her environment again, 
bolstered up by memories and 
friends and security. Not even 
Peter. 

There was a knock on the door. 

“Wait,” she called peremp- 
torily. 

“I’m sorry, Muriel,” came 
Peter’s voice. “I know I forgot all 
about you for a moment.” 

Too many people rushed into 
marriage. If Peter did ask her, 
she would think it out very care- 
fully, as a scientist should, tak- 
ing her time. She would weigh 
all the advantages and disadvan- 
tages, and she would make very 
sure that she and Peter were 
right for each other before she 
would . 

“You must admit,” said Peter, 
“that I only neglected you for 
something pretty big. You told 
me so yourself,” 

She picked up the lace wrap 
to throw it out of sight. It wasn’t 
that she thought there was any- 
thing wrong with it, she admitted 
to herself. She just didn’t have 
the nerve to wear a thing like > 
that. 1 

“Please,” said Peter. 

She threw off her dressing- 
gown and slipped into the pink 
wrap. It settled on her like a 
cloud of perfumed mist. 

“Come in, Peter,” she said.

T HE females and children 
worked among the lichen 
growth, picking off the fat- 
test, ripest leaves for their food 
and moisture, completing their 
arc of the circle of symbiosis. 

The males worked at the sur- 
face of the canals, or in open 
excavations. Their wide, mutated 
hands chipped into the rock-hard 
clay, opening a channel which 




was to be filled with sand and 
then sealed off with clay on all 
sides and surface. That water 
might seep through the sand 
without evaporation, without 
loss, from the poles to the equatof 
of Mars — seep unimpeded, so 
that moisture might reach the 
lichen plants of everyone, so that 
none might thirst or hunger. 

The seepage must flow. Not 
even buried in the dim racial 
memory had there ever been one 
who took more than his share, 
for this would be like the fingers 
of one hand stealing blood from 
the fingers of the other. 

Among the Mars race there 
were many words for content- 
ment, kinship of each to all. 
There were words to express the 
ecstasy of watching the eternal 
stars, by night and by day, 
through the thin blackish atmo- 
sphere. There were words to ex- 
press the joy of opening slitted 
nostrils to breathe deeply in those 
protected places where the blow- 
ing sands did not swirl, of open- 
ing folds of rubbery skin to catch 
the weak rays of the distant Sun. 

But there were no words for 
“mine * 1 as separate from “yours.” 
And there was no urge to cry 
out, “Why am I here? What is 
the purpose of it all?’* 

Each had his purpose, serene, 
unquestioning. Each repaired or 
extended the seepage canals so 
that others, unborn, might know 



the same joys and ecstasies as 
they. The work was in itself a 
part of the total joy; and they 
resisted it no more than healthy 
lungs resist clear, cool air. 

So far back that even the con- 
cept of beginnings had been for- 
gotten, the interwoven fabric of 
their symbiotic interdependence 
seeped through their lives as nat- 
urally as the precious water 
seeped through the canal sands. 
As far back as that, they had 
achieved civilization. 

Their kind of civilization. 

C APTAIN Griswold maintained 
an impassive face. (Let that, 
too, be a part of the legend.) 
Without expression, he looked 
through the screen at the red land 
flashing below the ship. But un- 
consciously he squared his shoul- 
ders, breathed deeply, enjoying 
the virile pull of his uniform over 
his expanding ch$st. Resolutely 
he pushed aside the vision of 
countless generations of school 
children, yet to come, repeating 
the lesson dutifully to their 
teachers. 

“Captain Thomas H. Griswold 
took possession of Mars, June 
14 , 2018 .” 

No, he must not allow any 
mood of vanity to spoil his own 
memories of this moment. It was 
beside the point that his name 
would rank with the great names 
of all times. Still, the history of 



WE'RE CIVILIZED I 



57 



the moment could not be denied. 

Lieutenant Atkinson’s voice 
broke through his preoccupation, 
and saved him the immodest 
thought of wondering if perhaps 
his cap visor might not be worn 
a little more rakishly to one side. 
He must father a custom, some- 
thing distinctive of those who 
had been to Mars — 

“Another canal, sir.” 

Below them, a straight line of 
gray-green stretched to the hori- 
zon, contrasting sharply with the 
red ferrous oxide of the land- 
scape. An entire planet of ferrous 
oxide — iron — steel for the already 
starving technology of the Western 
Alliance. The captain felt a mo- 
mentary irritation that even this 
narrow swath displaced the pre- 
cious iron ore. 

Obviously these canals served 
no purpose. His ship had circled 
the planet at its equator, and 
again from pole to pole. Canals 
everywhere, but nothing else. 
Enough time and fuel had been 
wasted. They must land. Obvi- 
ously there was no intelligent life. 
But the history of the moment 
must not be marred by any 
haste. There must be no question 
within the books yet to be writ- 
ten. There must be no accredited 
voice of criticism raised. 

“My compliments to Mr. Berk- 
eley,” he said harshly to Lt. At- 
kinson, “and would .he kindly 
step to the control room?” He 



paused and added dryly, “At his 
convenience.*’ 

Mister Berkeley, indeed. What 
was it they chlled the civilian — 
an ethnologist? A fellow who was 
supposed to be an authority on 
races, civilizations, mores and 
customs of groups. Well, the man 
was excess baggage. There would 
be no races to contact here. A j 
good thing, too. These civilian j 
experts with their theories — show ! 
them a tooth and they’ll dream ! 
up a monster. Show them a 
fingernail paring and they’ll de- 
duce a civilization from it. Non- 
sense! 

“You wanted to see me, Cap- 
tain?” The voice was young, 
quiet, controlled. 

W ITHOUT haste. Captain 
Griswold turned and faced 
Berkeley. Not only a theorist, but 
a young theorist. These super- 
bright young men with their 
sharp blue eyes. A lot of learning 
and no knowledge. A lot of wis- 
dom and no common sense. He 
carefully controlled his voice, 
concealing his lack of respect for 
the civilian. 

“Well, Mr. Berkeley, we have 
quartered the globe. We have seen 
no evidence of civilization.” 

“You discount the canals, Cap- 
tain?” Berkeley asked, as if more 
from curiosity than refutation. 

“I must discount them,” the 
captain answered decisively.

“Over all the planet we have seen 
no buildings, not even ruins, no 
evidence at all that intelligence 
exists here.” 

“I consider straight lines, run- 
ning half the length of a world, 
to be evidence of something, sir.** 
It was a flat statement, given 
without emphasis. 

Arguments! Arguments! Little 
men who have to inflate them- 
selves into a stature of import- 
ance — destroy the sacred history 
of the moment. But quietly now. 
There must be no memory of 
petty conflict. 

“Where are their buildings, Mr. 
Berkeley?” he asked with patient 
tolerance. “Where are their fac- 
tories? The smoke from their fac- 
tories? The highways? The 
transportation facilities? Where 
are the airplanes? Even this thin 
air would support a fast jet. I 
do not require they have space- 
ships, Mr. Berkeley, to concede 
them intelligence. I do not re- 
quire they be the equal of Man. 
I also have some scientific train- 
ing. And my training tells me I 
cannot recognize the existence of 
something where there is no evi- 
dence at all.’* 

“The canals,” Berkeley an- 
swered. His voice also was con- 
trolled, for he, too, knew the 
history of this moment. But his 
concern was not for his own name 
in the history books. He knew 
only too well what its writers did 



to individuals for the sake of 
expediency. His concern was that 
this moment never be one of deep 
shame for Man. “Perhaps they 
have no buildings, no factory 
smoke, because they don’t need 
them. Perhaps they don’t have 
highways because they don’t 
want to go anywhere. Perhaps 
their concept of living is com- 
pletely unlike ours.” 

G riswold shrugged his 

shoulders. “We speak an en- 
tirely different language, Mr. 
Berkeley.” 

“I’m afraid you’re right, Cap- 
tain,” Berkeley sighed. “And it 
might be a tragic thing that we 
do. Remember, European man 
spoke a different language from 
that of the American Indian, the 
Mayan, Polynesian, African, In- 
donesian — ” He broke off as if 
the list were endless. “I ask only 
that we don’t hasten into the 
same errors all over again.” 

“We can’t hover here above the 
surface forever,” Griswold said 
irritably. “We have quartered the 
globe. The other experts are 
anxious to land, so they can get 
to their work. We have made a 
search for your civilization and 
we have not found it.” 

“I withdraw all objections to 
landing. Captain. You are en- 
tirely correct. We must land.” 
The intercom on the wall 
squawked into life. 



WE'RE CIVILIZED I

“Observation to Control. Ob- 
servation to Control. Network of 
canals forming a junction ahead.’* 
“Prepare for landing, Lieuten- 
ant Atkinson,” Griswold com- 
manded sharply. “At the junc- 
tion.” He turned and watched the 
screen. “There, Mr. Berkeley, 
dead ahead. A dozen — at least a 
dozen of your canals joining at 
one spot. Surely, if there were a 
civilization at all, you would find 
it at stich a spot.’* Slowly and 
carefully, he constructed the 
pages of history. “I do not wish 
the implication ever to arise that 
this ship’s commander, or any 
of its personnel, failed to co- 
operate in every way with the 
scientific authorities aboard.” 

“I know that, Captain,” Berk- 
eley answered, “And I agree. The 
junction, then.” 

rj^HE sigh of servo-mechanism, 
-*■ the flare of intolerably hot 
blue flame, and the ship stood 
motionless above the junction of 
canals. Ponderously, slowly, she 
settled; held aloft by the pillars 
of flame beneath her, directly 
above the junction, fusing the 
sand in the canals to glass, ex- 
ploding their walls with steam. 
Within their warm and protected 
burrows beside the canals, slitted 
nostrils closed, iris of eyes con- 
tracted, fluted layers of skin 
opened and pulled tight, and 
opened again convulsively in the 



reflexes of death. 

There was a slight jar only as 
the ship settled to the ground, 
bathed in the mushrooming 
flame. 

“A good landirig, Lieutenant,” 
Captain Griswold complimented. 
“A good landing, indeed.” 

His head came up and he 
watched the sefeen to see the 
landscape reappear through the 
dust and steam. 

“Prepare to disembark in ap- 
proximately six hours, Lieuten- 
ant. The heat should have sub- 
sided sufficiently by then. The 
ship’s officers, the civ — er — scien- 
tific party, a complement of men. 
I will lead the way. You, Lieu- 
tenant, will carry tke flag and 
the necessary appurtenances to 
the ceremony. We will hold it 
without delay.” 

Berkeley was watching the 
screen also. He wondered what 
the effect of the landing heat 
would be on the canals. He won- 
dered why it had been considered 
necessary to land squarely on the 
junction; why Man always, as if 
instinctively, does the most de- 
structive thing he can. 

He shrugged it away. Wherever 
they landed might have been the 
wrong place. 

F ARTHER along the canals, 
where the heat had not 
reached, the Mars race began to 
emerge from their protecting bur- 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



rows. They had seen the meteor 
hurtling downward, and it was 
part of their conditioning to seek 
their burrows when any threaten- 
ing phenomenon occurred. 

Flaming meteors had fallen be- 
fore, but never in the interlocked 
racial mind was there memory of 
one which had fallen directly on 
a canal junction. Within the fab- 
ric of their instinct, they sensed 
the fused sand, the broken clay 
walls, the water boiling through 
the broken walls, wasted. They 
sensed the waters on the other 
side of the barrier seeping on- 
ward, leaving sand unfilled. 
Within the nerves of their own 
bodies they felt the anticipated 
pangs of tendril roots searching 
down into the sand for water, and 
not finding it. 

The urgency came upon them, 
all within the region, to remove 
this meteor; restore the canals 
as soon as the heat would permit. 
They began to gather, circling the 
meteor, circling the scorched 
ground around it. The urgency of 
getting at it before there was too 
much water lost drove them in 
upon the hot ground. 

The unaccustomed heat held 
them back. They milled uncer- 
tainly, in ^increasing numbers, 
around the meteor. 

OINCE Captain Griswold had 
^ not asked him to leave the 
control room during landing 



operations, Berkeley still stood 
and watched the screen. At the 
first appearance of the Mars race 
emerging from the soil, he ex- 
claimed in great excitement: 
"There they are! There they 
are, Captain!'* 

Griswold came over and stood 
beside him, watching the screen. 
His eyes widened. 

"Horrible,’’ he muttered in re- 
vulsion. The gorge arose in his 
throat and stopped his speech for 
a moment. But history took pos- 
session of him again. ‘T suppose 
we will get accustomed to their 
appearance in tiyie,” he conceded. 

"They’re the builders, Captain. 
Wonderful!” Berkeley exulted. 
"Those shovel-shaped forelimbs 
— they're the builders!” 

"Perhaps,” Griswold agreed. 
"But in the way a mole or gopher 
— still, if they were intelligent 
enough to be trained for mining 
operations — but then you certain- 
ly cannot call these things in- 
telligent, Mr. Berkeley.” 

"How do we know, Captain?” 
But the Captain was looking 
about vainly for buildings, for 
factory smoke, for highways. 

“Lieutenant Atkinson!” he 
called. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Send an immediate order 
throughout the ship. The Mars 
things are not to be molested.” 
He glanced at Berkeley as he 
gave the order, and thert glanced

away. “Double the complement 
of men on the landing party and 
see that they are fully armed.” 
Then back to Berkeley, “A good 
leader guards against every con- 
tingency. But there will be no , 
indiscriminate slaughter. You 
may be assured of that. I am as 
anxious as you that Man — ” 

“Thank you, Captain,” Berk- 
eley answered. “And the planting 
of the flag? The taking posses- 
sion?” 

“Well, now, Mr. Berkeley, 
what shall we do, now that we 
have seen some — things? Go 
away? Leave an .entire planet of 
iron ore to be claimed later by 
Eastern Alliance? The enemy is 
not far behind us in their technol- 
ogy, Mr. Berkeley.” 

He warmed to his theme, his 
head came up, his shoulders back. 

“Suppose these things are in- 
telligent. Suppose they do have 
feelings of one kind or another. 
What would happen to them if 
the Eastern Alliance laid claim 
to this planet? Under us, at least, 
they will have protection. We will 
set aside reservations where they 
may live in peace. Obviously they 
live in burrows in the ground; I 
see no buildings. Their total food 
supply must be these miserable 
plants. What a miserable exist- 
ence they have now! 

“We will change that. We will 
provide them with adequate food, 
the food to fill their empty stom- 



achs — if they have stomachs. We 
will clothe their repulsive naked- 
ness. If they have enough sense 
to learn, we will give them the 
pride of self-employment in our 
mines and factories. We would 
be less than human, Mr. Berk- 
eley, if we did not acknowledge 
our duty.” 

The light of noble intention 
shone in his face. He was swept 
swept away with his own elo- 
quence. 

“If,” he finished, “we take care 
of the duty, the destiny will take 
care of itself I” 

That was very good. He hoped 
they would have the grace to 
quote him on that. It was a fine 
summing up of his entire char- 
acter. 

Berkeley smiled a rueful smile. 
There was no stopping it. It was 
not a matter of not planting the 
flag, not taking possession. The 
captain was right. If not the Wes- 
tern Alliance, then certainly the 
Eastern Alliance. His quarrel was 
not with the captain nor with 
the duty, but with the destiny. 
The issue was not to be decided 
now. It had already been decided 
— decided when the first aperaan 
had crept into the tree nest of 
another and stolen his mate. 

Man takes. Whether it be by 
barbaric rapine, or reluctant ac- 
ceptance of duty through care- 
fully contrived diplomacy, Man 
takes.

Berkeley turned and made his 
way out of the control room. 

O UTSIDE, the soil shifted in. 

its contortions of cooling. 
The wind whispered dryly over 
the red landscape, sending up 
little swirls of dust, eternally 
shifting it from one place to an- 
other. The soil was less hot, and 
as it cooled, the Mars race 
pressed inward. Theirs was - the 
urgency to get at this meteor as 
quickly as possible, remove it, 
start the water flowing once more. 

“Observation reports ground 
cool enough for landing!” The 
magic words seemed to sing into 
the control cabin. 

“Summon all landing party,” 
Captain Griswold commanded 
immediately. 

The signal bells rang through- 
out the ship. The bell in the 
supercargo cabin rang also. With 
the other scientists, Berkeley 
dressed in his protecting suit, 
fitted the clear glassite oxygen 
helmet over his head, fastened it. 
Together with the rest, he stood 
at the designated airlock to await 
the captain’s coming. 

And the captain did not keep 
them waiting. At precisely the 
right moment, with only a flicker 
of a side glance at the photo- 
graphic equipment, the captain 
strode ahead of his officers to the 
airlock. The sealing doors of the 
cbrridor behind them closed, 



shutting off the entire party » 
making the corridor itself into a 
great airlock. 

There was a long Sigh, and the 
great beams of the locks moved 
ponderously^against their weight. 
There was the rush of air from 
the corridor as the heavier pres- 
sure tushed out through the 
opening locks, to equalize with 
the thin air of Mars. With the 
air rushed outward fungus spores, 
virus, microbes; most of them to 
perish under the alien conditions, 
but some to survive — and thrive. 

The red light above the lock 
was blinking on-off- on-off. The 
officers, the scientists, the armed 
men, watched the light intently. 
It blinked off for the last time. 
The locks were open. The great 
ramp settled to the ground. 

I N ordered, military file, the 
captain at their head, the 
landing party passed down the 
corridor, through the locks, out 
upon the ramp beneath the blue- 
black sky; and down to the red 
soil. Captain Griswold was the 
first man to set foot on Mars, 
June 14, 2018. The photographers 
were second. 

Now the Mars race was mov- 
ing closer to the ship, but the 
ground was still too hot for their 
unprotected feet. The pressing 
need for removing the meteor 
possessed them. The movement of 
the men disembarking from the 

43 



WE'RE CIVILIZED! 



ship was to them no more than 
another unintelligible aspect of 
this incredible meteor. 

The sound of a bugle pierced 
the thin air, picked up by the 
loudspeaker from thC ship, rever- 
berating through their helmets. 
The landing party formed a 
semi-circle at the foot of the 
ramp. 

Captain Griswold, his face as 
rigidly set as the marble statuary 
of him to follow, reached out and 
took the flag from Lieutenant 
Atkinson. He planted it firmly, 
without false motion, in the 
framework one of the men had 
set upon the baked ground to 
receive it. 

He pointed to the north, the 
south, the east, the west. He 
brought his hands together, palms 
downward, arms fully out- 
stretched in front of him. He 
spread his arms wide open and 
down, then back together and up; 
completing a circle which encom- 
passed all the planet. He held out 
his right hand and received the 
scroll from Lieutenant Atkinson. 

With a decisive gesture, not 
quite theatrical, he unfurled the 
scroll. He read in a voice firm 
enough to impress all posterity; 

'‘By virtue of authority in- 
vested in me from the Supreme 
Council of the Western Alliance, 
the only true representatives of 
Earth and Man, I take possession 
of all this planet in the name of 



our President, the Supreme Coun- 
cil, the Western Alliance, Earth, 
and in the name of God.” 

T HE ground was cool enough 
now that their feet might bear 
it. The pain was great, but it was 
lost in the greater pain of feeling 
the killing obstruction the great 
meteor had brought to their 
canals. The Mars race began to 
press inward, inexorably. 

It was in the anticlimactic 
moment, following the possession 
ceremony, when men milled 
around in uncertainty, that Lt. 
Atkinson saw the Mars race had 
come closer and were still moving. 

“The monsters!” he exclaimed 
in horror. “They’re attacking!” 
Berkeley looked, and from the 
little gestures of movement out 
of his long training he deduced 
their true motive. 

“Not against us!” he cried. 
“The ship.” 

Perhaps his words were more 
unfortunate than his silence 
might have been; for the ship 
was of greater concern to Captain 
Griswold than his own person. 

“Halt!” Griswold shouted to- 
ward the approaching Mars race. 
“Halt or I’ll fire!” 

The Mars race paid no heed. 
Slowly they came forward, each 
step on the hot ground a torture, 
but a pain which could be borne. 
The greater torture, the one they 
could not bear, was the ache to 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



press against this meteor, pash it 
away, that they might dig the 
juncture clean again. As a man 
whose breath is stopped fights 
frantically for air, concerned with 
nothing else, so they felt the des- 
peration of drying sands. 

They came on. 

“For the last time,” Griswold 
shouted, “halt!” He made a mo- 
tion with his hands, as if to push 
them back, as if to convey his 
meaning by signs. Involuntarily, 
then, his eyes sought those of 
Berkeley. A look of pleading, 
helplessness. Berkeley met the 
glance and read the anxiety there, 
the tragic unwillingness of the 
man to arouse posterity’s rage 
or contempt. 

It was a brief glance only from 
both men and it was over. Cap- 
tain Griswold’s head came up; 
his shoulders straightened in the 
face of the oncoming monsters. 
They were close now, and coming 
closer. As always, the experts 
were free with their advice when 
it was not needed. When the 
chips were down, they could do 
no more than smirk and shrug 
a helpless shoulder. 

He gave the command, and 
now there was no uncertainty. 

“Fire!” 

T HE celebration was being held 
in the Great Stadium, the 
largest, most costly structure that 
Man had ever built. It was a fit- 

WE'RE CIVIUZIDI 



ting structure for the more im- 
portant football games; and used 
on occasion, if they could be 
fitted in without upsetting the 
schedule, for State affairs. Now 
the stadium was filled to capac- 
ity, its floor churned by the care- 
less feet of the thousands upon 
’thousands who had managed to 
obtain an entrance. 

From the quarter -mile -high 
tiers of seats, from the floor of 
the stadium, the shouts welled 
up, washing over the platform at 
the North end. 

“Griswold! Griswold!” 

It was not yet time for history 
to assess the justice of the mas- 
sacre. 

The President raised his hand. 
The battery of video cameras 
picked up each move. 

“Our hopes, our fears, our 
hearts, our prayers rode through 
every space- dark, star -flecked 
mile with these glorious pion- 
eers.” He turned then to the 
captain. “For the people of Earth, 
Admiral Griswold, this medal. A 
new medal for a Guider of Des- 
tiny, Maker of Empire, Son of 
Man!” 

The voice faltered, stopped. 

The crowd on the floor of the 
stadium was pressing outward 
from the center, screaming m 
pain and terror. At the moment 
when the people should be quiet, 
rapt in reverence, they were emp- 
tying the floor of the stadium. 

65 



But not willingly. They were be- 
ing pressed back and out, as a 
great weight pushes its way 
through water. Those who could 
move outward no farther were 
crushed where they stood. 

And then the ship appeared. 

Hazy of outline, shimmering 
with impossible angles, seen by* 
its glinting fire of light rather 
than by its solid form, as if its 
reality were in some other dimen- 
sion and this only a projection, 
the ship appeared. 

The President’s hand reached 
out and gripped Griswold’s 
shoulder as he leaned back and 
back, trying to determine its vast 
height. A silence then clutched 
the crowd — a terrified silence. 

A full minute passed. Even on 
the platform, where all the pio- 
neers of Mars were assembled 
with Earth’s dignitaries, even 
there the people cowered back 
away from this unseeable, un- 
knowable horror. 

But one man leaned forward 
instead, frantically studying the 
shimmering outline of the ship. 
One man — Berkeley. 

With the training of the eth- 
nologist, a man who really can 
deduce an entire civilization from 
mystifying data, he recognized 
the tremendous import. 

At the end of that minute, 
without warning, a group of 
figures hovered in the air near 
the floor of the stadium, 



Q UICKLY, Berkeley’s eyes 
assessed their form, their 
color, the increasing solidity of 
the humanoids. There are some 
movements, some gestures, com- 
mon to all things of intelligence — 
the pause, the resolution, the lift 
of pride. 

“Nor he screamed and started 
forward. “Oh, no! We’re civilized. 
We're intelligent!” He was pulled 
back, as in his terror he tried to 
leap from the platform to get at 
the humanoids. 

Held there, unable to move, he 
read the meaning of the actions 
of the group hovering near the 
ship. One flashed a shining ten- 
tacle around, as if to point to the 
stadium, the pitifully small 
spaceship on display, the crowds 
of people. 

The leader manifestly ignored 
him. He flowed forward a pace, 
his ovoid head held high in pride 
and arrogance. He pointed a ten- 
tacle toward the south end of the 
stadium, and a pillar of leaping 
flame arose; fed with no fuel, 
never to cease its fire, the symbol 
of possession. 

He pointed his tentacles to the 
north, the south, the east, the 
west. He motioned with his ten- 
tacles, as if to encircle all of 
Earth. 

He unfurled a scroll and began 
to read.

Scientific Journey 

G RAB yourself a botanist 
from the region of the 
Iron Curtain — either side 
of it. Fly him some 8000 miles 
along a Great Circle route, tim- 
ing your arrival to coincide with 
daybreak. Then parachute him to 
the ground, after having made 
sure first that there is no roa3

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sign, no store front, no adver- 
tising of any kind and in general 
no scrap of reading matter for 
miles around — and also nobody 
who could answer a question. In- 
struct your botanist that he'll be 
picked up just as soon as he con- 
vinces you by radio that he has 
identified his location; general 
terms like “the Kalahari desert” 
or “Java” will be acceptable. 

The very first thing your bot- 
anist is likely to see will make 
him believe that the task is an 
easy one ... a road, lined on both 
sides, as far as the eye can reach, 
with eucalyptus trees. There are 
also small groves of eucalyptus 
off the road; in fact, three or four 
different varieties can be found 
within easy walking distance. 
Now, eucalyptus is as typically 
Australian as the platypus — but 
what may cause our botanist 
some dismay is that clumps of 
bamboo nestle between and near 
some of the tall trees. Seeing 
these, he will probably wish that 
he had read something on the 
flora of Australia more recently 
than at the time he took his de- 
gree. The climate of northern 
Australia, of course, is such that 
bamboo can grow there — but does 
it? Possibly it has been intro- 
duced by Whites, or by the 
Chinese who can’t live without 
bamboo — but once you start con- 
sidering artificial introduction, 
you have to be twice as careful. 



Walking along, our botanist 
will see something that is also 
very typical ... of a landscape 
half way around the planet from 
Australia. There are half a dozen 
century plants, growing close to 
each other. Their place of origin 
is, of course, the southwestern 
part of the North American con- 
tinent. Eucalyptus and century 
plants cannot occur together 
without the intervention of Man, 
our botanist thinks. Therefore, 
one has been introduced. He notes 
that the century plants are in the 
minority by far. 

A T the turn of the road, the 
landscape suddenly changes. 
There is a big grove of lemon 
trees, which normally would point

to the Mediterranean — but this 
is a plantation. And beyond the 
plantation of comparatively small 
lemon trees, there are the heavy 
green-and-gold fountain sprays 
of date palms, scores and scores 
of them. This, of course, should 
indicate the general region of Ara- 
bia, Turkey, Palestine or North 
East Africa — but high above the 
date palms stretch lofty Royal 
palms, and other slender stems 
in the distance might well be 
coconut palms. 

Nearby, three banana plants 
rise from a clump of short bam- 
boo, but the fleeting impression of 
Central America — the climate 
doesn’t feel right either — is de- 
stroyed by a row of still another 
kind of palms. These startle the 
European botanist for a moment. 
They certainly aren’t date, nor 
are they the Royal Palm, even 
though at first glance they bear 
some slight resemblance to each. 
Searching back through his mem- 
ory, he may conclude that they 
are the type called Washing- 
tonias; trouble is, he has special- 
ized in the flora of the northern 
tundra. If there were only some- 
thing he could be sure of . 

Here is a stand of pines. From 
a distance, they look somewhat 
like poor specimens of the Euro- 
pean Pinus sylvestris; and the 
resemblance holds in some re- 
spects even when they are seen 
close by. Still, there are pro- 



nounced differences — and not far 
from that stand of pines, shel- 
tered by two big eucalyptus trees 
and flanked by several century 
plants, there grows a tree fern! 

By this time, the botanist is 
either ready to weep or is al- 
ready doing so because of the 
hopelessly tangled botanical mess 
around him. So we may as well 
take pity on him and tell him 
where he is: 

San Diego County, in Cali- 
fornia. 

No, I do not seriously advocate 
kidnapping botanists from the 
Iron Curtain area and flying 
them non-stop to San Diego; 
these were just some idle thoughts 
that crossed my mind as Chesley 
Bonestell drove me through this 
complex landscape on the road 
from San Diego to Palomar 
Mountain. 

What got me going was the 
fact that the plants which really 
belong there are around, but in a 
minority. The only native plant 
which appeared in any quantity 
was the Torrey pine, which does 
not grow elsewhere but which also 
requires specialized knowledge 
(or experience) to label properly. 
Practically all of the rest — the 
easily identified plants which 
greet the eye everywhere — are im- 
ports. The half-dozen varieties of 
eucalyptus are there because 
somebody in California once 
thought that eucalyptus was a 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



valuable timber tree, whereas act- 
ually its wood is not good for 
building, is poor for furniture and 
not even good for firewood. The 
millions of date palms were 
planted for obvious reasons/ not 
primarily to provide Hollywood 
with Arab settings. The lemon 
and orange groves do not really 
require explanation — but they 
dominate the landscape. 

W HAT happened to me is that 
I spent all of March on the 
road, if that phrase can be used 
with reference to a trip which was 
made exclusively by air. On the 
flight home from Denver (where 
I merely changed airlines) I 
added it up : the total was around 
11,000 miles. It was a lecture 
tour — several cities in Oklahoma 
and eastern Texas, then El Paso 
(no time for a side tfip to the 
White Sands Proving Ground, 
unfortunately), then Pasadena, 
and after that home to New York, 
with lecture stopovers in Utah 
and Wyoming. I have spoken 
with other people who have gone 
on such tours and they often 
used terms like a “grind,” or 
“hard work” and so forth. I don’t 
deny that it is hard work, but it 
was certainly not a “grind” — 3 
found something interesting to see 
wherever I went. 

One night professor Dr. Hu- 
bertus Strughold, the head of the 
Air Force’s Department of Space 



Medicine, drove me around. 
There were clumps of opuntias 
growing along the roadside, and 
he told me how local farmers, 
using surplus flame throwers, 
burn the spines of the plants, 
while their cattle wait eagerly 
behind them “as if those things 
were baked apples/’ Strughold 
did not tell this as a simple fact; 
it was somewhat more of a com- 
plaint — for he had told the story 
at a party in Washington, and 
somebody had remarked skeptic- 
ally that “Dr. Strughold has the 
most unusual ideas of what can 
be done.” It was not until Life 
magazine ran a picture -spread 
on this practice that he was be- 
lieved. 

This conversation took place 
while we went to see Dr. Ulrich 
G. Luft, former member of a Mt. 
Everest expedition and expert on 
medical problems of high alti- 
tude aviation. We were still talk- 
ing about it when Dr. Luft’s son 
brought in a bucket of fossils 
which they had found while gar- 
dening. Question : “What are 

they?” 

For once I was lucky. Even 
without any reference books, I 
could see that they were the 
shells of ammonites, shelled oc- 
topi which were quite common in 
the seas of the Jurassic and Cre- 
taceous periods. Judging from the 
locality I could be even more 
specific: ammonites from the 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



71 



Niobrara sea of the Upper Cre- 
taceous. I don’t know the opinion 
of the local chamber of com- 
merce, but to me San Antdn is 
the place where I had to classify 
a bucketful of fossils without 
preparation, or warning. 

Likewise, El Paso is not merely 
the airport nearest the White 
Sands Proving Ground, but the 
city where three unexpected 
events happened all in one day. 
One of them was that T unex- 
pectedly met Clyde Tombaugh, 
the discoverer of Pluto, who had 
come to my lecture. The second 
was that I saw my first genuine 
western dust storm — I know 
they’re not rare, but I had never 
been in one before. My com- 
panions were somewhat unhappy 
about it, because they had wanted 
to show me their city from a 
lookout point — and if it had been 
my fifth or sixth dust storm, I 
suppose I might have felt the 
same way. As it was, I welcomed 
it, as I did my first earthquake 
twelve years ago (Bob Heinlein 
still claims that he arranged it 
for me). 

The third unexpected event 
had actually preceded the dust 
storm; I had been informed in 
the morning that a visit to Fort 
Bliss would be welcomed and that 
the commanding officer, General 
Mickelsen, had set some time 
aside for me. Then I was in- 
formed that a number of their 



“graduates” were assembled in 
the basement of building such- 
and-such, and that it would be 
appreciated if I spoke to them. 

On the way over, I tried to 
think of something that the 
“graduates” of Fort Bliss might 
not know about rockets or mis- 
siles. 

W HEN I got there my prob- 
lem was still unsolved. But, 
leaning against a Nike missile, I 
saw the pumping unit of a V-2, 
and then I had something to 
tell. The only danger left was 
that Wernher von Braun, from 
whom I had the story, had told 
it to these people also. 

In a small liquid fuel rocket, as 
most of the readers of GALAXY 
Science Fiction are apt to know, 
you can feed the rocket motor by 
simply pressurizing the two tanks 
holding the fuel and the oxidizer. 
Of course, fairly strong tanks 
are required to withstand a pres- 
surization of some 250 pounds 
per square inch, but in a small 
rocket this does not constitute 
much of a problem. As the rocket 
grows in overall size, however, a 
considerable weight penalty be- 
gins to creep in if you continue 
pressurizing the tanks; and once 
the rocket has a take-off weight 
of, say, a ton or more, you have 
to pump the fuel. Then the tanks 
can be comparatively light, since 
they hold the fuel in the same 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



P* manner as the fu'el tanks in ears 
and planes, while the job of force 
feeding the motor is done by the 
pumps. It was at the time when 
the Peenemiinde Institute was 
doing preliminary work on the 
V-2 that the pump problem came 
up in earnest. 

Wernher on Braun first as- 
signed a man to make a general 
study about pumps; the man 
came up with the reply that 
there didn't seem to be anything 
which spoke very strongly either 
in favor or against piston pumps 
or centrifugal pumps and that 
the choice would depend on the 
“status of the art” — the actual 
accomplishments of pump build- 
ers. 

A conference with a manufac- 
f turer was set up, and von Braun 
arrived with some preliminary 
specifications, convinced that at 
one point or another the engineers 
would tell him that this or that 
“simply couldn't be done." He 
began by telling them that he 
needed two pumps, each of which 
wotild have to handle some 150 
pounds of liquid per second. 

This was greeted by a respect- 
ful silence. 

He continued that the low pres- 
sure end would be just about 16 
lbs. per square inch, while the 
high pressure end would have to 
deliver some 320 lbs. per second. 
Still silence. 

Then he added that the pres- 



sure at the high pressure end 
would have to be kept within a 
fraction of one per cent of the 
value. 

Still silence. 

It was necessary, furthermore, 
he explained, that the pump 
should not need more than a very 
few seconds from standstill to 
full delivery pressure. And since 
nobody had yet said that all this 
was impossible, he concluded by 
pointing out that these pumps 
must be capable of being stored 
for many months, yet at any time 
must be ready for instant use. 

Whereupon one of the pump 
engineers said that all this simply 
amounted to a plain, everyday 
firefighters’ pump. 

Such a pump has to have high 
delivery pressure, because the 
firefighter has to shoot the water 
jet over a considerable distance. 
The pressure must be very 
steady; otherwise the fireman 
wouldn’t aim properly. And since 
fires happen relatively infre- 
quently and at unpredictable mo- 
ments, the equipment obviously 
must function perfectly after long 
storage and reach full delivery 
pressure swiftly, since in fire fight- 
ing seconds may count. 

The moral of the story is, of 
course, that if you build a space- 
ship and need a synchronized 
double hyperframmis, don’t sit 
down and design it ... it might 
be in use in the biscuit industry. 



FO* YOUR INFORMATION 



73 



T>HOENIX, Arizona, is “in the 
valley of the sun,” and is a 
prime tourist attraction. Every- 
body is greatly surprised to learn 
that you came there on business. 
But, as usual, I learned a few 
things. 

It was one of the rare times 
in my life when I got a naked-eye 
view of the planet Mercury. In 
fact, there was quite a nice astro- 
nomical display: Venus was bril- 
liant in the evening sky (the 
telescope proved her to be in the 
phase which is called lima fallax 
when applied to the moon) ; 
Jupiter was higher up, and Mars 
off to one side of Venus. 

But what was more interesting 
to me was the collection of bells 
at the college in Tempe, Arizona. 

Ranchers and farmers continu- 
ally find them, and when they see 
that there are two stars on one 
side and the letters U.S. on the 
other, they assume that the bells 
are government property and turn 
them in to the college — which 
doesn’t bother to pass them on, 
because the government doesn’t 
care anymore. 

The bells are camel bells. 

Shortly before the Civil War, 
a number of people reasoned as 
follows: “We are now conquering 
the West, The area between 
present-day forts and present- 
day and future settlements is 
mostly desert. In North Africa, 
no animal is as useful in the 



desert as the camel. Hence camel* 
will be useful in the West.” 

U. S. officers were sent to Egypt 
to buy camels and import camel 
drivers. Camels were bred in this 
country and sent West. There . 
were the beginnings of a U.S. 
camel cavalry — but then things 
began to go wrong. The Civil 
War came along and interrupted 
proceedings; also, it turned out 
that while the camel’s feet are ad- 
mirably suited to the sandy 
deserts of Africa and Arabia, they 
do not stand up well in the 
stony deserts of our West. 

For a while camels did indus- 
trial load carrying. A number 
escaped; others were set free by 
disappointed owners, who turned 
to horses and burros instead. 
There were wild camels for a 
short time, but they made them- 
selves quite obnoxious — no diffi- 
culty at all for a camel — and were 
shot. 

Only two things remain of this 
episode — the bells, with the let- ' 
ters U.S.; and rumors that off- 
spring of those -camels still roam 
the western deserts. The scientists \ 
at Tempe are certain that no 
camels roam in their vicinity ; but 
they concede that possibility for 
the areas bordering Mexico, 
where there are sandy deserts. 

Speaking about the difference

them off. This, at least, is the 
experience of the experts in the 
fabulous Desert Botanical Gar- 
den near Phoenix. 

When I got there — my hostess 
at the Hudson Lodge had insisted 
this was something I had to see — 
I was puzzled by a metal struc- 
ture. It did not look reasonable, 
being merely a skeleton of angle 
iron supporting a lot of parallel 
metal slats. It certainly would 
not keep out the rain (if that was 
the intention), and the plants 
growing there did not look as 
though they needed anything to 
hold onto while climbing. In fqct, 
they didn’t look as if they could 
climb, even if you promised them 
fertilizer. Well, as old Dr. W. 
Taylor Marshall explained, it was 
supposed to do something en- 
tirely different — namely to pro- 
vide a diffused shade for his 
collection of African desert 
plants. 

IT was also Dr. Marshall who 
told me a large number of 
facts about the giant saguaro 
cacti, which is the way they spell 
the name in Arizona — in botani- 
cal handbooks, the spelling sa- 
huaro seems to be preferred. In 
Europe, they are known as “pil- 
lar cacti,” which I consider a 
nice descriptive term. The bo- 
tanical name is Cereus giganteu s. 

Easterners who see them for 
the first time in tjieir natural 



habitat often wonder whether the 
plant is still alive. There it stands, 
stiff and inflexible, dusty and 
dry in the desert. Many of them 
are covered with holes, about an 
inch across, made by woodpeck- 
ers. After the woodpeckers leave, 
a tiny sparrow -sized bird, the elf 
owl, takes over the hole. 

Those saguaros are among the 
slowest -growing plants. Dr. Mar- 
shall has a collection labeled by 
age — 5, 10, 15, 20 years and so 
on — all of which you could keep 
on your desk in pots so far as 
size goes — a 40 -year-old specimen 
was barely higher than my knee. 
But those that grew outside were 
more than, ten feet tall; they 
count a century of growth for 
every six feet. 

When they are very young, 
the sun is their enemy, for a one- 
year-old saguaro, being about the 
size of a pea, can grow only in 
the shade of a bush. Fifty years 
later, the bush is gone, and yet 
the cactus is still very young, 
but strong enough to live in di- 
rect sunlight. 

They don’t have a tap root, 
but a horizontal root system 
which, in an old and massive 
specimen, may cover a circular 
area sixty feet in diameter. When 
it rains, they can absorb water 
at a rate which is not rivaled by 
any plant on earth; and they are 
built accordingly. When you 
look at them, with their vertical 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



7S 



ridges, you visualize a wooden 
skeleton something like that of 
an airliner’s fuselage: long string- 
ers held in place by circular 
members. Well, it is somewhat 
like that — the long stringers, ver- 
tical in this case, are there. But 
they join at irregular intervals, 
and each joint is between two 
“stringers” only; there are no 
circular members; the plant can 
expand fast when there is a 
chance of getting water. 

When you see a picture of a 
saguaro, you usually recognize it 
by its odd branches; but every 
once in a while you find one 
which really looks like a pillar. 
I wasn’t there long enough to see 
one in person, but I was shown a 
photograph of a 14-foot straight 
and unbranched specimen, which 
had grown up in a sheltered spot. 
According to Dr. Marshall, this 
would be the norm if they were 
all sheltered — the branching 
merely serves to balance the 
plant. They have 60-mile winds 
on occasion, and since Cereus gi- 
ganteus does not have a tap root, 
such a wind often forces it out of 
plumb. Then it simply grows a 
branch to stabilize itself. It is 
not known just how this works 
— Dr. Strughold, with whom I 
discussed this later, guessed that 
it might be the tensed tissue. At 
any event, the branch does not 
stop growing when it is large 
enough and heavy enough to 



serve the purpose of balancing — 
it keeps growing, overbalancing 
the whole in the other direction, 
and so a new branch has to form 
to counteract the first. Dr. Mar- 
shall told me that he did not feel 
certain whether he should accept 
this explanation, and took a 
straight saguaro cactus, planting 
it at an angle. 

It branched ... 

I can’t leave off without tell- 
ing the best remark I heard dur- 
ing the whole trip. The scene: a 
restaurant at the San Diego 
waterfront, at dinner time. The 
participants: two scientists from 
the Scripps Oceanographic In- 
stitute at La Jolla, California, 
Chesley Bonestell and myself. 
The topic of discussion: oceano- 
graphic expeditions — in particu- 
lar, the last one of the Scripps 
Institute. 

“Yes,” said Dr. Hamilton, talk- 
ing about the expedition: “they 
went to the Marquesas, and to 
the Tonga islands. They made a 
side trip to Samoa, and then 
went to Oahu. And then they 
came home to La Jolla and de- 
manded a vacation!”

ANY QUESTIONS? 

I am annoyed by the nonsense 
of “ weightlessness .” Far out in 
space, if we could get there, may- 
be, but why should something be 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



weightless close to Earth? Re- 
cently some scientists have even 
said that one could be weight- 
less in the atmosphere. If rockets 
got to be weightless, they would 
fly off into space and not fall 
back. ** 

Charles D. Collins 
15203- Fairway Dr. 
Santa Maria, Calif. 

It is evident that you think 
“weightlessness” means that the 
body which is weightless is out- 
side any gravitational field, spe- 
cifically that of the Earth. Just 
because Jules Verne and H. G. 
Wells indulged in muddled and 
inconclusive thinking about the 
actions of gravity, this does not 
have to go on forever. 

Let’s try to clear up the prob- 
lem by first stating what 
“weight” is. The definition 
which should be taught in 
school (but isn’t, as I well 
know) is that weight is the re- 
sult of fighting or impeding the 
pull of gravity. 

As I Sit here in front of my 
typewriter, my body cannot fol- 
low the pull of gravity* It is 
supported by a chair, the chair 
is kept from following the pull 
of gravity by the floor, the floor 
is, in turn, supported by the 
ground. The result is that I am 
prevented from falling, which 
gives the sensation of weight. 
If I were not prevented from 
falling in other words, if I 



could follow the pull of gravity 
freely — I would not feel any 
weight. (, 

Therefore; a rocket which 
falls back from its peak alti- 
tude of, say, 110 miles is under 
the influence of gravity, all 
right, but weightless since noth- 
ing impedes its fall until it en- 
ters the denser layers of the 
atmosphere. 

Recently I heard a scientist 
say that a body could be weight- 
ier and still have its full inertia. 
Did I understand this correctly 
and if l did, how can this be? 

W. A. Robertson 
2233 Canyon Drive 
Santa Monica, Calif. 

First, please read my reply 
to Mr. Collins as to the defini- 
tion of weight. But whether 
weightlessness occurs inside a 
gravitational field, near a space 
station, for example, or so far 
from any gravitational field 
that it is due simply to the ab- 
sence of gravitation, the inertia 
of a moving body is not 
changed. 

This can be realized best by 
looking at the formula for the 
inertia (more precisely the 
kinetic energy) of a body. It 
reads m/2 times v 2 $ you multi- 
ply half of its mass by the 
square of its velocity. 

IVo factor which has anything 
to do with a gravitational field 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



77 



appears in this formula. It is 
merely a question of the body’s 
mass and its velocity. While the 
concept of something as mas- 
sive as an iron ball, without 
weight but with all its inertia, 
might be strange at first glance, 
it is nevertheless correct. 

The question voted among us 
as “the question we'd most like 
Ley to discuss” is the following: 
What is the basis of Einstein's 
Theory of Relativity? 

Martin Evans, Pres. 
Miami Beach S.F. Club 
1329 Penn Ave. 

Miami Beach 39, Fla. 

This is a hard question in- 
deed, partly because of the sub- 
ject matter, partly because dif- 
ferent people are likely to have 
different opinions as to what 
they regard as the most impor- 
tant tenet ; the tendency then 
being to regard this as the 
“basic” idea. 

One man may quote Min- 
kowski’s statement “space in it- 
self and time in itself sink to 
mere shadows and only a kind 
of union of the two retains an 
independent existence” and 
consider the concept of space- 
time the “basis.” Another man 
may feel that the elimination of 
the “ether” and the explanation 
of gravity as a kind of “illu- 
sion” is the most important. 
Still others might insist, with 



much justification, that the 
“basic” thoughts are those 
which got Einstein started ; like 
the “contraction” of George 
Francis FitzGerald, published 
by him in 1892 and, about half 
a year later, by Hendrick An- 
toon Lorentz, and now usually 
called the Lorentz-FitzGerald 
contraction. Or the concept of 
the velocity of light as the lim- 
iting velocity, first published by 
Jules Henri Poincare in 1904, 
a full year before Einstein an- 
nounced his. 

Poincar^ stated le principe 
de Ui relativite by saying that 
the laws of physical phenomena 
must be the same both for a 
fixed and a uniformly moving 
observer, so that the observer 
himself cannot possibly tell 
whether he is in motion or not. 
Then he continued that this re- 
quired une mecanique entiere- 
ment nouvelle, qui serait sur- 
tout caracterisee par ce fait 
qu’aucune vitesse ne pouvait 
de passer celle de la lufiere. 

In English: “an entirely new 
concept which, above all, is 
characterized by the fact that 
no speed can surpass that of 
light.” 

Any one of the concepts men- 
tioned may be considered “the 
basis,” but I think that most 
physicists might agree that 
Poincare’s enunciation of the 
principles is “it.”

He said he wasn't immortal— bt/f nothing 
could kill him. Still, if the Earth was 
to live as a free world, he had to die.

OME right in, gentle - 
fl men,” the Ambassador 
waved them into the 
very special suite the State De- 
partment had given him. “Please 
be seated.” 

Colonel Cercy accepted a chair, 
trying to size up the individual 
who had all Washington chewing 
its fingernails. The Ambassador 
hardly looked like a menace. He 
was of medium height and slight 
build, dressed in a conservative 
brown tweed suit that the State 
Department had given him. His

DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



face was intelligent, finely molded 
and aloof. 

As human as a human, Cercy 
thought, studying the alien with 
bleak, impersonal eyes. 

“How may I serve you?” the 
Ambassador asked, smiling. 

“The President has put me in 
charge of your case,” Cercy said. 
“I've studied Professor Darrig’s 
reports — ” he nodded at the scien- 
tist beside him — “but I’d like to 
$jear the whole thing for myself.” 

“Of course,” the alien said, 
lighting a cigarette. He seemed 
genuinely pleased to be asTced; . 
which was interesting, Cercy 
thought. In the week since he 
had landed, every * important 
scientist in the country had been 
at him. 

But in a pinch they call the 
Army, Cercy reminded himself. 
He settled back in his chair, both 
hands jammed carelessly in his 
pockets. His right hand was rest- 
ing on the butt of a .45, the 
safety off. 

“T HAVE come,” the alien said, 
“as an afhbassador- at-large, 
representing an empire that 
stretches half-way across the 
Galaxy. I wish to extend the wel- 
come of my people and to invite 
you to join our organization.” 

“I see,” Cercy replied. “Some 
of the scientists got the impres- 
sion that participation was com- 
pulsory.” 



“You will join,” the Ambassa- 
dor said, blowing smoke through 
his nostrils. 

Cercy could see Darrig stiffen 
in his chair and bite his Up. Cercy 
moved the automatic to a posi- 
tion where he could draw it 
easily. “How did you find us?” 
he asked. 

“We ambassadors- at-large are 
each assigned an unexplored sec- 
tion of space,” the alien said. “We 
examine each star- system in that 
region for planets, and each 
planet for intelligent life. Intelli- 
gent life is rare in the Galaxy, 
you know.” 

Cercy nodded, although he 
hadn’t been aware of the fact. 

“When we find such a planet, 
we land, as I did, and prepare 
the inhabitants for their part in 
our organization.” 

“How will your people know 
that you have found intelligent 
life?” Cercy asked. 

“There is a sending mechanism 
that is part of our structure,” the 
Ambassador answered. “It is trig- 
gered when we reach an inhabited 
planet. This signal is beamed con- 
tinually into space, to an effec- 
tive range of several thousand 
light-years. Follow-up crews are 
continuaUy sweeping through the 
limits of the reception area of 
each Ambassador, listening for 
such messages. Detecting one, a 
colonizing team follows it to the 
planet.”

He tapped his cigarette deli- 
cately on the edge of an ash tray. 
“This method has definite advan- 
tages over sending combined 
colonization and exploration 
teams obviously. It avoids the 
necessity of equipping large 
forces for what may be decades 
of searching.” 

“Sure.” Cercy’s face was ex- 
pressionless. “Would you tell me 
more about this message?*' 

“There isn’t much more you 
need know. The beam is not de- 
tectable by your methods and, 
therefore, cannot be jammed The 
message continues as long as I am 
alive.” v 

T'VARRIG drew in his breath 
sharply, glancing at Cercy. 

“If you stopped broadcasting,” 
Cercy said casually, “our planet 
would never be found.” 

“Not until this section of space 
was resurveyed,” the diplomat 
agreed. 

“Very well. As a duly appoint- 
ed representative of the President 
of the United States, I ask you 
to stop transmitting. We don’t 
choose to become part of your 
empire.” 

“I’m sorry,” the Ambassador 
said. He shrugged his shoulders 
easily. Cercy wondered how many 
times he had played this scene 
on how many other planets. 

“There’s really nothing I can 
do.” He stood up. 



“Then you won’t stop?” 

“I can t. X have no control over 
the sending, once it’s activated.” 
The diplomat turned and walked 
to the window. “However, I have 
prepared a philosophy for you. It 
is my duty, as your Ambassador, 
to ease the shock of transition as 
much as possible. This philoso- 
phy will make it instantly ap- 
parent that — ” 

As the Ambassador reached the 
window, Cercy 1 s gun was out of 
his pocket and roaring. He 
squeezed six rounds in almost a 
single explosion, aiming at the 
Ambassador’s head and back. 
Then an uncontrollable shudder 
ran through him. 

The Ambassador was no longer 
there! 

C ERCY and Darrig stared at 
each other. Darrig muttered 
something about ghosts. Then, 
just as suddenly, the Ambassa- 
dor was back. 

“You didn’t think,” he said, 
“that it would be as easy as all 
that, did you? We Ambassadors 
have, necessarily, a certain diplo- 
matic immunity.” He fingered one 
of the bullet holes in the wall. 
“In case you don’t understand, 
let me put it this way. It is not in 
your power to kill me. You 
couldn’t even understand the na- * 
ture of my defense.” 

He looked at them, and in that 
moment Cercy felt the Ambas- 



DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



83 



sador’s complete alienness. 

“Good day, gentlemen,” he 
said. 

Darrig and Cercy walked si- 
lently back to the control room. 
Neither had really expected that 
the Ambassador would be killed 
so easily; but it bad still been 
a shock when the slugs had failed. 

“I suppose you saw it all, Mal- 
ley?" Cercy asked, when he 
reached the control room. 

The thin, balding psychiatrist 
nodded sadly. “Got it on film, 
too.” 

“I wonder what his philosophy 
is,” Darrig mused, half to himself. 

“It was illogical to expect it 
would work. No race would send 
an ambassador with a message 
like that and expect him to live 
through it. Unless — ” 

“Unless what?” 

“Unless he had a pretty effec- 
tive defense,” the psychiatrist 
finished unhappily. 

Cercy walked across the room 
and looked at the video panel. 
The Ambassador’s suite was very 
special. It had been hurriedly con- 
structed two days after he had 
landed and delivered his message: 
The suite was steel and lead lined, 
filled with video and movie cam- 
eras, recorders, and a variety of 
other things. 

* It was the last word in elabor- 
ate death cells. 

In the screen, Cercy could see 
the Ambassador sitting at a table. 



He was typing on a little portable 
the Government had given him. 

“Hey, Harrison!” Cercy called. 
“Might as well go ahead with 
Plan Two.” 

Harrison came out of a side 
room where he had been examin- 
ing the circuits leading to the 
Ambassador’s suite. Methodically . 
he checked his pressure gauges, 
set the controls and looked at 
Cercy. “Now?” he asked. 

“Now.” Cercy watched the 
screen. The Ambassador was still 
typing. 

Suddenly, as Harrison sent 
home the switch, the room was 
engulfed in flames. Fire blasted 
out of concealed holes in the 
walls, poured from the ceiling 
and floor. 

In a moment, the room was like 
the inside of a blast furnace. 

Cercy let it burn for two min- ' 
utes, then motioned Harrison to 
cut the switch. They stared at the 
roasted room. 

They were looking, hopefully, 
for a charred corpse. 

But the Ambassador reap- 
peared beside his desk, looking ’ 
ruefully at the charred type- 
writer. He was completely un- 
singed. 

“Could you get me another 
typewriter?” he asked, looking 
directly at one of the hidden 
projectors. “I’m setting down 
philosophy for you ungrateful 
wretches.”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He seated himself in the wreck- 
age of an armchai^. In a moment, 
he was apparently asleep. 

“ A LL right, everyone grab a 
seat,” Cercy said. “Time for 
a council of war.” 

Malley straddled a chair back- 
ward. Harrison lighted a pipe as 
he sat down, slowly puffing it into 
life. 

“Now, then,” Cercy said. “The 
Government has dropped this 
squarely in our laps. We have to 
kill the Ambassador — obviously. 
I’ve been put in charge.” Cercy 
grinned with regret. “Probably 
because no one higher up wants 
the responsibility of failure. And 
I've selected you three as my 
staff. We can have anything we 
want, any assistance or advice we 
need. All right. Any ideas?” 

“How about Plan Three?” Har- 
rison asked. 

“We’ll get to that,” Cercy said. 
“But I don't believe it's going to 
work.” 

“I don’t either,” Darrig agreed. 
“We don’t even know the nature 
of his defense.” 

“That’s the first order of busi- 
ness. Malley, take all our data 
so far, and get someone to feed it 
into the Derichman Analyzer. 
You know the stuff we want. 
What properties has X, if X can 
do thus and thus?” 

“Right,” Malley said. He left, 
muttering something about the 



ascendancy of the physical sci- 
ences. 

“Harrison,” Cercy asked, “is 
Plan Three set up?” 

“Sure.” 

“Give it a try.” 

While Harrison was making his 
last adjustments, Cercy watched 
Darrig. The plump little physi- 
cist was staring thoughtfully into 
space, muttering to himself. Cercy 
hoped he would come up with 
something. He was expecting 
great things of Darrig. 

Knowing the impossibility of 
working with great numbers of 
people, Cercy had picked his staff 
with care. Quality was what he 
wanted. 

With that in mind, he had 
chosen Harrison first. The stocky, 
sour-faced engineer had a reputa- 
tion for being able to build any- 
thing, given half an idea of how 
it worked. 

Cercy had selected Malley, the 
psychiatrist, because he wasn’t 
sure that killing the Ambassador 
was going to be a purely physical 
problem. 

Darrig was a mathematical 
physicist, but his restless, curious 
mind had come up with some 
interesting theories in other fields. 
He was the only one of the four 
who was really interested in the 
Ambassador as an intellectual 
problem. 

“He’s like Metal Old Man,” 
Darrig said finally. 



DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



* 85 



“What’s that?” 

“Haven’t you ever heard the 
story of Metal Old Man? Well, 
he was a monster covered with 
black frietal armor. He was met 
by Monster- Slayer, an Apache 
culture hero. Monster -Slayer, 
after many attempts, finally 
killed Metal Old Man.” 

“How did he do it?” 

“Shot him in the armpit. He 
didn’t have any armor there.” 
“Fine,” Cercy grinned. “Ask 
our Ambassador to raise his 
arm.” 

“All set?” Harrison called. 
“Fine. Go.” 

In the Ambassador’s room, an 
invisible spray of gamma rays 
silently began to flood the room* 
with deadly radiation. 

But there was no Ambassador 
to receive them. 

“That’s enough,” Cercy said, 
after a while. “That would kill 
a herd of elephants.” 

But the Ambassador stayed in- 
visible for five hours, until some 
of the radioactivity had abated. 
Then he appeared again. 

“I'm still waiting for that type- 
writer,” he said. 

“TTERE’S the Analyzer’s re- 
port.” M alley handed Cercy 
a sheaf of paper?. “This is the 
final formulation, boiled down.” 
Cercy read it aloud: “The sim- 
plest defense against any and all 
weapons, is to become each par- 



ticular weapon.” 

“Great,” Harrison said. “What 
does it mean?” 

“It means,” Dairig explained, 
“that when we attack the Ambas- 
sador with fire, he turns into 
fire. Shoot at him, and he turns 
into a bullet — until the menace is 
gone, and then he changes back 
again.” He took the papers out of 
Cercy’ a hand and riffled through 
them. 

“Hmm. Wonder if there’s any 
historical parallel? Don’t sup- 
pose so.” He raised his head. “Al- 
though this isn’t conclusive, it 
seems logical enough. Any other 
defense would involve recognition 
of the weapon first, then, an ap- 
praisal, then a countermove predi- 
cated on the potentialities of the 
weapon. The Ambassador’s de- 
fense would be a lot faster and 
safer. He wouldn’t have to recog- 
nize the weapon. I suppose his 
body simply identifies, in some 
way, with the menace at hand.” 

“Did the Analyzer say there 
was any way of breaking this de- 
fense?” Cercy asked. 

“The Analyzer stated definitely 
that there was no way, if the 
premise were true,” Malley an- 
swered gloomily. 

“We can discard that judg- 
ment,” Darrig said. “The machine 
is limited.” 

“But we still haven’t got any 
way of stopping him,” Malley 
pointed out. “And he’s still broad -

casting that beam.” 

Cercy thought for a moment. 
“Call in every expert you can 
find. We’re going to throw the 
book at the Ambassador. I know/’ 
he said, looking at Darrig’s du- 
bious expression, "but we have 
to try.” 

rvURING the next few days, 
every combination and per- 
mutation of death was thrown at 
the Ambassador. He was show- 
i ered with weapons, ranging from 
| Stone-Age axes to modern high- 
powered rifles, peppered with 
hand grenades, drowned in acid, 
suffocated in poison gas. 

He kept shrugging his shoul- 
I ders philosophically, and con- 

tinued to work on the new type- 
! writer they had given him. 

j Bacteria was piped in, first the 
| known germ diseases, then mu- 

i tated species. 

The diplomat didn’t even 
sneeze. 

I He was showered with elec- 
tricity, radiation, wooden weap- 
\ ons, iron weapons, copper weap- 

1 ons, brass weapons, uranium 

1 weapons — anything and every- 

thing, just to cover all possibili- 
ties. 

He didn’t suffer a scratch, but 
i his room looked as though a bar- 

room brawl had been going on in 
it continually for fifty years. 

Malley was working on an idea 
of his own, as was Darrig. The 



physicist interrupted himself long 
enough to remind Cercy of the 
Baldur myth. Baldur had been 
showered with every kind of 
weapon and remained unscathed, 
because everything on Earth had 
promised to love him. Everything, 
except the mistletoe. When a little 
twig of it was shot at him, he 
died. 

Cercy turned away impatient- 
ly, but had an order of mistletoe 
sent up, just in case. 

It was, at least, no less effective 
than the explosive shells or the 
bow and arrow. It did nothing ex- 
cept lend an oddly festive air to 
the battered room. 

After a *week of this, they 
moved the unprotesting Ambas- 
sador into a newer, bigger, 
stronger death cell. They were 
unable to venture into his old 
one because of the radioactivity 
and micro-organisms. 

The Ambassador went back to 
work at his typewriter. All his 
previous attempts had been 
burned, torn or eaten away. 

“Let’s go talk to him,” Darrig 
suggested, after another day had 
passed. Cercy agreed. For the mo- 
ment, they were out of ideas. 

OME right in, gentlemen,” 
the Ambassador said, so 
cheerfully that Cercy felt sick. 
“I’m sorry 3 can’t offer you any- 
thing. Through an oversight, I 
haven’t been given any food or 



DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



87 



water for about ten days. Not 
that it matters, of course.”, 

“Glad to hear it,” Cercy said. 
The Ambassador hardly looked 
as if he had been facing all the 
violence Earth had to offer. On 
the contrary, Cercy and his men 
looked as though they had been 
under bombardment. 

“YouVe got quite a defense 
there,” Malley said conversation- 
ally. 

“Glad you like it.” 

“Would you mind telling us 
how it works?” Darrig asked in- 
nocently. 

“Don’t you know?” 

“We think so. You become 
what is attacking y*u. Is that 
right?” 

“Certainly,” the Ambassador 
said. “You see, I have no secrets 
from you.” 

“Is there anything we can give 
you,” Cercy asked, “to get you to 
turn off that signal?” 

“A bribe?” 

“Sure,” Cercy said. “Anything 
you — ?” 

“Nothing,” the Ambassador re- 
plied. 

“Look, be reasonable,” Harri- 
son said. “You don’t want to 
cause A war, do you? Earth is 
united now. We're arming — ” 

“With what?” 

“Atom bombs,” ' Malley an- 
swered him. “Hydrogen bombs. 
We’re—” 

“Drop one on me,” the Am- 

88 



bassador said. “It wouldn’t kill 
me. What makes you think it . 
will have any effect on my peo- 1 
pie?” | 

* i 

T HE four men were silent, j 

Somehow, they hadn't thought j 
of that. I 

“A people’s ability to make ; 
war,” the Ambassador stated, “is j 
a measure of the status of their 
civilization. Stage one is the use 
of simple physical extensions. 
Stage two is control at the mo- 
lecular level. You are on the 
threshold of stage three, although ■ 
still far from mastery of atomic 
and subatomic forces.” He smiled 
ingratiatingly. “My people are 
reaching the limits of stage five.” 
“What would that be?” Darrig 
asked. 

“You’ll find out,” the Ambas- 
sador said. “But perhaps you’ve 
wondered if my powers are typ- 
ical? I don’t mind telling you that 
they’re not. In order for me to 
do my job and nothing more, I ; 
have certain built-in restrictions, 
making me capable only of pas- 
sive action.” 

“Why?” Darrig asked. j 

“For obvious reasons. If I were j 
to take positive action in a mo- j 
ment of anger, I might destroy j 
your entire planet.” \ 

“Do you expect us to believe j 
that?” Cercy asked. t 

“Why not? Is it so hard to un- 
derstand? Can’t you believe that 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



5 



there are forces you know noth- 
ing about? And there is another 
reason for my passiveness. Cer- 
tainly by this time you’ve de- 
duced it?” 

“To break our spirit, I sup 
pose,” Cercy said. 

“Exactly. My telling you won’t 
make any difference, either. The 
pattern is always the same. An 
Ambassador lands and delivers 
his message to a high-spirited, 
wild young race like yours. There 
is. frenzied resistance against him, 
spasmodic attempts to kill him. # 
After all these fail, the people are 
usually quite crestfallen. When 
the colonization team arrives, 
their indoctrination goes along 
just that much faster.” He paused, 
then said, “Most planets are more 
interested in the philosophy I 
have to offer. I assure you, it 
will make the transition far 
easier.” 

He held out a sheaf of type- 
written pages. “Won’t you at least 
look through it?” 

Darrig accepted the papers and 
put them in his pocket. “When 
I get time.” 

“I suggest you give it a try,” 
the Ambassador said. “You must 
be near the crisis point now. Why 
not give it up?” 

“Not yet,” Cercy replied tone- 
lessly. 

“Don’t forget to read the phil- 
osophy,” the Ambassador urged 
them. 

DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



The men hurried from the 
room. 

“TVTOW look,” Malley said, once 
-L ’ they were back in the con- 
trol room, “there are a few 
things we haven’t tried. How 
about utilizing psychology?” 

“Anything you like,” Cercy 
agreed, “including black magic. 
What did you have in mind?" 

“The way I see it,” Malley an- 
swered, “the Ambassador is 
geared to-respond, instantaneous- 
ly, to any threat. He must have 
an all-or-nothing defensive re- 
flex. I suggest first that we try 
something that won't trigger that 
reflex.” 

“Like what?” Cercy asked. 

“Hypnotism. Perhaps we can 
find out something." 

"Sure,” Cercy said. “Try it. 
Try anything.” 

Cercy, Malley and Darrig gath- 
ered around the video screen as 
an infinitesimal amount of a light 
hypnotic gas was admitted into 
the Ambassador’s room. At the 
same time, a bolt of electricity 
lashed into the chair where the 
Ambassador was sitting. 

“That was to distract him," 
Malley explained. The Ambassa- 
dor vanished before the electricity 
struck him, and then appeared 
again, curled up in his armchair. 

“That’s enough,” Malley whis- 
pered, and shut the valve. They 
watched. After a while, the Am- 

89 



bassador put down his book and 
stared into the distance. 

“How strange,” he said. “Alfern 
dead. Good friend . just a freak 
accident. He ran into it, out there. 
Didn’t have a chance. But it 
doesn’t happen often.” 

“He’s thinking out loud,” Mal- 
ley whispered, although there was 
no possibility of the Ambassador’s 
hearing them. “Vocalizing his 
thoughts. His friend must have 
been on his mind for some time.” 
“Of course,” the Ambassador 
went, on, “Alfern had to die some- 
time. No immortality — yet. But 
that way — no defense. Out there 
in space they just pop up. Al- 
ways there, underneath, just 
waiting for a chance to boil out.” 
“His body isn’t reacting to the 
hypnotic as a menace yet,-” Cercy 
whispered. 

“Well,” the Ambassador told 
himself, “the regularizing prin- 
ciple has been doing pretty well, 
keeping it all down, smoothing 
out the inconsistencies — ” 

Suddenly he leaped to his feet, 
his face pale for a moment, as he 
obviously tried to remember what 
he had said. Then he laughed. 

“Clever. That’s the first time 
that particular trick has been 
played on me, and the last time. 
But, gentlemen, it didn’t do you 
any good. I don’t know, myself, 
how to go about killing me.” He 
laughed at the blank walls. 

“Besides,” he continued, “the 



colonizing team must have the di- ; 
rection now. They’ll find you ' 
with or without me.” 

He sat down again, smiling. 

“rpHAT does it!” Darrig cried. 

-P- “He’s not invulnerable. Some- 
thing killed his friend Alfern.” 

“Something out in space,” 
Cercy reminded him.. “I wonder 
what it was.” 

“Let me see,” Darrig reflected 
aloud. “The regularizing prin- 
ciple. That must be a natural law 
,we knew nothing about. And un- 
derneath — what would be under- 
neath?” 

“He said the colonization team . 
would find us anyhow,” M alley 
reminded them. 

“First things first,” Cercy said. 
“He might have been bluffing us 
... no, I don’t suppose so. We 
still have to get the Ambassador 
out of the way.” ' ; 

“I think I know what is under- 
neath!” Darrig exclaimed. “This J 
is wonderful. A new cosmology, | 
perhaps.” • * 

“What is it?” Cercy asked. 
“Anything we can use?” v 

“I think so. But let me work | 
it out. I think I’ll go back to : 
my hotel. I have some books ‘ 
there I want to check, and I don’t ' 
want to be disturbed for a few 
hours.” 

■‘All right,” Cercy agreed. “But 
what — ?” 

“No, no, I could be wrong,”

Darrig *said. “Let me work it 
out.” He hurried from the room. 

“What do you think he’s driv- 
ing at?” Malley asked. 

“Beats me,” Cercy shrugged. 
“Come on, let’s try some more of 
that psychological stuff.’* 

First they filled the Ambassa- 
dor’s room with several feet of 
water. Not enough to drown him, 
just enough to make him good 
and uncomfortable. 

To this, they added the lights. 
For eight hours, lights flashed in 
the Ambassador’s room. Bright 
lights to pry under his eyelids; 
dull, clashing ones to disturb him. 

Sound came next — screeches 
and screams and shrill, grating 
noises. The sound of a man’s 
fingernails being dragged across 
slate, amplified a thousand times, 
and strange, sucking noises, and 
shouts and whispers. 

Then, the smells. Then, every- 
thing else they could think of that 
could drive a man insane. 

The Ambassador slept peace- 
fully through it all. 

N OW look,” Cercy said, the 
following day, “let’s start 
using our damned heads.” His 
voice was hoarse and rough. Al- 
though the psychological torture 
hadn’t bothered the Ambassador, 
it seemed to have backfired on 
Cercy and his men. 

“Where in hell is Darrig?” 
“Still working on that idea of 



his,” Malley said, rubbing his 
stubbled chin. “Says he’s just 
about got it.” 

“We’ll work on the assumption 
that he can’t produce,” Cercy 
said. “Start thinking. For exam- 
ple, if the Ambassador can turn 
into anything, what is there he 
can’t turn into?” 

“Good question,” ^ Harrison 
grunted. 

“It’s the payoff question,” , 
Cercy said. “No use throwing a 
spear at a man who can turn 
into one.” 

“How about this?” Malley 
asked. “Taking it for granted he 
can turn into anything, how about 
putting him in a situation where 
he’ll be attacked even after he 
alters?” 

“I’m listening,” Cercy said. 

“Say he’s in danger. He turns 
into the thing threatening him. 
What if that thing were itself be- 
ing threatened? And, in turn, was 
in the act of threatening some- 
thing else? What would he do 
then?” 

“How are you going to put that 
into action?” Cercy asked. 

“Like this.” Malley picked up • 
the telephone. “Hello? Give me 
the Washington Zoo. This is 
urgent.” 

The Ambassador turned as the 
door opened. An unwilling, angry, 
hungry tiger was propelled in. 
The door slammed shut. 

The tiger looked at the Ambas- 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sador. The Ambassador looked £t 
the tiger. 

“Most ingenious,” the Ambas- 
sador said. 

At the sound of his voice, the 
tiger came unglued. He sprang 
like a steel spring uncoiling, land- 
ing on the floor where the Am- 
bassador had been. 

The door opened again. An- 
other tiger was pushed in. He 
snarled angrily and leaped at the 
first. They smashed together in 
midair. 

The Ambassador appeared a 
few feet off, watching. He moved 
back when a lion entered the 
door, head up and alert. The lion 
sprang at him, almost going over 
on his head when he struck noth- 
ing. Not finding any human, the 
lion leaped on one of the tigers. 

The Ambassador reappeared in 
his chair, where he sat smoking 
and watching the beasts kill each 
other. 

In ten minutes the room looked 
like an abattoir. 

But by then the Ambassador 
had tired of the spectacle, and 
was reclining on his bed, reading. 

“T GIVE up,”. Malley said. 

“That was my last bright 
idea.” 

Cercy stared at the floor, not 
answering. Harrison was seated in 
the corner, getting quietly drunk. 

The telephone rang. 

“Yeah?” Cercy said. 

DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



“I’ve got it!” Darrig' s voice 
shouted over the line. “I really 
think this is it. Look, Fm taking 
a cab right down. Tell Harrison 
to find some helpers.” 

“What is it?” Cercy asked. 
“The chaos underneath!” Dar- 
rig replied, and hung up. 

They paced the floor, waiting 
for him to show up. Half an hour 
passed, then an hour. Finally, 
three hours after he had called, 
Darrig strolled in. 

“Hello,” he said casually. 
“Hello, hell!” Cercy growled. 
“What kept you?” 

“On the way. over,” Darrig 
said, “I read the Ambassador’s 
philosophy. It’s quite a work.” 
“Is that what took you so 
long?” 

“Yes. I had the driver take me 
around the* park a few times, 
while I was reading it.” 

“Skip it. How about — ” 

“I can’t skip it,” Darrig said, 
in a strange, tight voice. “I’m 
afraid we were wrong. About the 
aliens, I mean. It’s perfectly right 
and proper that they should rule 
us. As a matter of fact, I wish 
they’d hurry up and get here.” 
But Darrig didn’t look certain. 
His voice shook and perspiration 
poured from his face. He twisted 
his hands together, as though in 
agony. 

“It’s hard to explain,” he said. 
“Everything became clear as soon 
as I started reading it. I saw how 

93 



stupid we were, trying to be in- 
dependent in this interdependent 
Universe. I saw — oh, look, Cercy. 
Let's stop all this foolishness and 
accept the Ambassador as our 
friend.” 

“Calm down!” Cercy shouted 
at the perfectly calm physicist. 
“You don’t know what you’re 
saying.” 

“It^s strange,” Darrig said. “I 
know how I felt — I just don’t feel 
that way any more. I think. Any- 
how, I know your trouble. You 
haven’t read the philosophy. 
You’ll see what I mean, once 
you’ve read it.” He handed Cercy 
the pile of papers. Cercy prompt- 
ly ignited them with his cigarette 
lighter. 

“It doesn’t matter,” Darrig 
said. “I’ve got it memorized. Just 
listen. Axiom one. All peoples — ” 

Cercy hit him, a short, clean 
blow, and Darrig slumped to the 
floor. 

“Those words must be seman- 
tically keyed,” Malley said. 
“They’re designed to set off cer- 
tain reactions in us, 1 suppose. 
All the Ambassador does is alter 
the philosophy to suit the peo- 
ples he’s dealing with.” 

“Look, Malley,” Cercy said. 
“This is your job now. Darrig 
knows, or thought he knew, the 
answer. You have to get that out 
of him,” 

“That won’t be easy,” Malley 
said. “He’d feel that he was be- 



traying everything he believes in, 
if he were to tell us.” 

“I don’t care how you get it,” 
Cercy said. “Just get it.” 

“Even if it kills him?” Malley 
asked, 

“Even if it kills you.” 

“Help me get him to my lab,” 
Malley said. 

T HAT night Cercy and Harri- 
son kept watch on the Ambas- 
sador from the control room. 
Cercy found his thoughts were 
racing in circles. 

What had killed Alfem in 
space? Could it be duplicated on 
Earth? What was the regularizing 
principle? What was the chaos 
underneath? 

What in hell am I doing here? 
he asked himself. But he couldn’t 
start that sort of thing. 

“What do you figure the Am- 
bassador is?” he asked Harrison. 
“Is he a man?” 

“Looks like one,” Harrison said 
drowsily. 

“But he doesn’t act like one. I 
wonder if this is his true shape?” 
Harrison shook his head, and 
lighted his pipe. 

“What is ther^ of him?” Cercy 
asked. “He looks like a man, but 
he can change into anything else. 
You can’t attack him; he adapts. 
He’s like water, taking the shape 
of any vessel he’s poured into.” 
“You can boil water,” Harrison 
yawned. 



94 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Sure. Water hasn’t any shape, 
has it? Or has it? What’s basic?” 
With an effort, Harrison tried 
to focus on Cercy’s words. “Mo- 
lecular pattern? The matrix?” 
“Matrix,” Cercy repeated, 
yawning himself. “Pattern. Must 
be something like that. A pattern 
is abstract, isn’t it?” 

“Sure. A pattern can be im- 
pressed on anything. What did I 
say?” 

“Let’s see,” Cercy said. “Pat- 
tern. Matrix. Everything about 
the Ambassador is capable of 
change. There must be some uni- 
fying force that retains his per- 
sonality. Something that doesn't 
change, no matter what contor- 
tions he goes through.” 

“Like a piece of string,” Harri- 
son murmured with his eyes 
closed. 

“Sure. Tie it in knots, weave a 
rope out of it, wind it around 
your finger; it’s still string.” 
“Yeah.” 

“But how do you attack a pat- 
tern?” Cercy asked. And why 
couldn’t he get some sleep? To 
hell with the Ambassador and 
his hordes of colonists, he was 
going to close his eyes for a mo- 
ment . 

AKE up, Colonel!” 

Cercy pried his eyes open 
and looked up at Malley. Besides 
him, Harrison W as snoring deep- 
ly. “Did you get anything?” 

DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



“Not a thing,” Malley con- 
fessed. “The philosophy must’ve 
had quite an effect on him. But 
it didn’t work all the way, Darrig 
knew that he had wanted to kill 
the Ambassador, and for good 
and sufficient reasons. Although 
he felt differently now, he still had 
the feeling that he was betraying 
us. On the one hand, he couldn’t 
hurt the Ambassador; on the 
other, he wouldn’t hurt us.” 
“Won’t he tell anything?” 

“I’m afraid it’s not that sim- 
ple,” Malley said. “You know, if 
you have an insurmountable ob- 
stacle that must be surmounted 
. and also, I think the phil- 
osophy had an injurious effect on 
his mind,” 

“What are you trying to say?” 
Cercy got to his feet. 

“I’m sorry,” Malley apologized, 
“there wasn’t a damned thing I 
could do. Darrig fought the whole 
thing out in his mind, and when 
he couldn’t fight any longer, he — 
retreated. I’m afraid he’s hope- 
lessly insane.” 

“Let’s see him.” 

They walked down the corridor 
to Malley’s laboratory. Darrig 
was relaxed on a couch, his eyes 
glazed and staring. 

“Is there any way of curing 
him?” Cercy asked. 1 

“Shock therapy, maybe.” Mal- 
ley was dubious. “It’ll take a long 
time. And he’ll probably block 
out everything that had to do 

95 



with producing this.** 

Cercy turned away, feeling 
sick. Even if Darrig could be 
curedj it would be too late. The 
aliens must have picked up the 
Ambassador’s message by now 
and were undoubtedly heading 
for Earth. 

“What’s this?” Cercy asked, 
picking up a piece of paper that 
lay by Darrig’s hand. 

“Oh, he was doodling,” Malley 
said. “Is there anything written 
on it?” 

Cercy read aloud: “ ‘Upon fur- 
ther consideration I can see that 
Chaos and the Gorgon Medusa 
are closely related.’ ” 

“What does that mean.?” Mal- 
ley asked. 

“I don’t know,” Cercy puzzled. 
“He was always interested in 
folklore.” 

“Sounds schizophrenic,” the 
psychiatrist said. 

Cercy read it again. “ ‘Upon fur- 
ther consideration, I can see that 
Chaos and the Gorgon Medusa 
are closely related.’ ” He stared 
at it. “Isn’t it possible,” he asked 
Malley, “that he was trying to 
give us a clue? Trying to trick 
himself into giving and not giving 
at the same time?” 

“It’s possible,” Malley agreed. 
“An unsuccessful compromise — 
But what could it 'mean?” 

“Chaos,” Cercy remembered 
Darrig’s mentioning that word in 
his telephone call. “That was the 



original state of the Universe in 
Greek myth, wasn’t it? The form- 
lessness out of which everything 
came?” 

“Something like that,” Malley 
said. “And Medusa was one of 
those three sisters with the horri- , 
ble faces.” 

Cercy stood for a moment, i 
staring at the paper. Chaos . ' 

Medusa. and the organizing 
principle! Of course! 

“I think — ” He turned and ran 
from the room. Malley looked at j 
him; then loaded a hypodermic | 
and followed. 1 

I N the control room, Cercy 
shouted Harrison into con- 
sciousness. \ 

“Listen,” he said, “I want you ■ 
to build something, quick. Do you 
hear me?” 

“Sure.” Harrison blinked and 
sat up. “What’s the rush?” 

“I know what Darrig wanted- 
to tell us,” Cercy said. “Come 
on. I’ll tell you what I want. And 
Malley, put down that hypo- 
dermic. I haven’t cracked. I want 
you to get me a book on Greek 
mythology. And hurry it up.” 
Finding a Greek mythology 
isn’t an easy task at two o’clock 
in the morning. With the aid of 
FBI men, Malley routed a book 
dealer out of bed. He got his book 
and hurried back. 

Cercy was red -eyed and excit- 
ed, and Harrison and his helpers 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



were working away at three crazy 
looking rigs. Cercy snatched the 
book from Malley, looked up one 
item, and put it down. 

“Great work,” he said. “We’re 
all set now. Finished, Harrison?” 

“Just about.” Harrison and ten 
helpers were screwing in the last 
parts. “Will you tell me what 
this is?” 

“Me too,” Malley put in. 

“I don’t mean to be secretive,” 
Cercy said. “I’m just in a hurry. 
I’ll explain as we go along.” He 
stood up. “Okay, let’s wake up 
the Ambassador.” 

r |iHEY watched the screen as a 
bolt of electricity leaped from 
the ceiling to the Ambassador’s 
bed. Immediately, the Ambassa- 
dor vanished. 

“Now he’s a part of that stream 
of electrons, right?” Cercy asked. 

“That’s what he told us,” Mal- 
ley said. 

“But still keeping his pattern, 
within the stream,” Cercy con- 
tinued. “He has to, in order to 
get back into his own shape. Now 
we start the first disrupter.” 

Harrison hooked the machine 
into circuit, and sent his helpers 
away. 

“Here’s a running graph of the 
electron stream,” Cercy said. “See 
the difference?” On the graph 
there was an irregular series of 
peaks and valleys, constantly 
shifting and leveling. “Do you 



remember when you hypnotized 
the Ambassador? He talked about 
his friend who'd been killed in 
space.” 

“That’s right,” Malley nodded. 
“His friend had been killed by 
something that had just popped 
up.” 

“He said something else,” Cer- 
cy went on. “He told us that the 
basic organizing force of the Uni- 
verse usually stopped things like 
that. What does that mean to 
you?” 

“The organizing force,” Malley 
repeated slowly. “Didn’t Darrig 
say that that was a new natural 
law?” 

“He did. But think of the im- 
plications, as Darrig did. If an 
organizing principle is engaged 
in some work, there must be 
something that opposes it. That 
which opposes organization is — ” 

“Chaos!” 

“That’s what Darrig thought, 
and what we should have seen. 
The chaos is underlying, and out 
of it there arose an organizing 
principle. This principle, if I’ve 
got it right, sought to suppress 
the fundamental chaos, to make 
all things regular. 

“But the chaos still boils out 
in spots, as Alfera found out. Per- 
haps the organizational pattern is 
weaker in space. Anyhow, those 
spots are dangerous, tin til the or- 
ganizing principle gets to work on 
them.” 



DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



97 



H E turned to the panel. “Okay, 
Harrison. Throw in the sec- 
ond disrupter.” The peaks and 
valleys altered on the graph. They 
started to mount in crazy, mean- 
ingless configurations. 

“Take Darrig's message in the 
light of that. Chaos, we know, is 
underlying. Everything was form- 
ed out of it. The Gorgon Medusa 
was something that couldn’t be 
looked upon. She turned men in- 
to stone, you recall, destroyed 
them. So, Darrig found a rela- 
tionship between chaos and that 
which can’t be looked upon. All 
with regard to the Ambassador, 
of course.” 

“The Ambassador can’t look 
upon chaos!” Malley cried. 

“That’s it. The Ambassador is 
capable of an infinite number of 
alterations and permutations. But 
something — the matrix — can’t 
change, because then there would 
be nothing left. To destroy some- 
thing as abstract as a pattern, 
we need a state in which no pat- 
tern is possible. A state of chaos.” 
The third disrupter was thrown 
into circuit. The graph looked as 
if a drunken caterpillar had been 
sketching on it. 

“Those disrupters are Harri- 
son’s idea,” Cercy said. “I told 
him I wanted an electrical cur- 
rent with absolutely no coherent 
pattern. The disrupters are an ex- 
tension of radio jamming. The 
first alters the electrical pattern. 



99 



That's its purpose: to produce a 
state of patternlessness. The sec- 
ond tries to destroy the pattern 
left by the first; the third tries to 
destroy the pattern made by the 
first two. They’re fed back then, 
and any remaining pattern is sys- 
tematically destroyed in circuit 
... I hope.” 

“This is supposed to produce 
a state of chaos?” Malley asked, 
looking into the screen. 

For a while there was only the 
whining of the machines and the 
crazy doodling of the graph. 
Then, in the middle of the Am- 
bassador’s room, a spot appeared. 
It wavered, shrunk, expanded — 

What happened was indescrib- 
able. All they knew was that 
everything within the spot had 
disappeared. 

“Switch it off” Cercy shoutedT 
Harrison cut the switch. 

The spot continued to grow. 

“How is it we’re able to look 
at it?” Malley asked, staring at 
the screen, 

“The shield of Perseus, remem- 
ber?” Cercy said. “Using it as a 
mirror, he could look at Medusa.” 

“It’s still growing!” Malley 
shouted. 

“There was a calculated risk in 
all this,” Cercy said. “There’s al- 
ways the possibility that the cha- 
os may go on, unchecked. If that 
happens, it won’t matter much 
what — ” 

The spot stopped growing. Its 



edges wavered and rippled, and 
then it started to shrink. 

“The organizing principle,” 
Cercy said, and collapsed into a 
chair. 

“Any sign of the Ambassador?” 
he asked, in a few minutes. 

The spot was still wavering. 
Then it was gone. Instantly there 
was an explosion. The steel walls 
buckled inward, but held. The ■ 
screen went dead. 

“The spot removed all the air 
from the room,” Cercy explained, 
“as well as the furniture and the 
Ambassador.” 

“He couldn’t take it,” Malley •. 
said. “No pattern can cohere, in 
a state of pattemlessness. He’s 
gone to join Alfern.” 

Malley started to giggle. Cercy 
felt like joining him, but pulled 
himself together. 

“Take it easy,” he said. “We’re 
not through yet.*’ 

“Sure we are! The Ambassa- i 
dor — ” 

“Is out of the way. But there’s ; 
still an alien fleet homing in on ] 
this region of space. A fleet so j 
strong we couldn’t scratch it with j 
an H-bomb. They’ll be looking | 
for us.” I 

He stood up. i 

“Go home and get some sleep. 
Something tells me that tome 
row we’re going to have to start 
figuring out some way of camou- 
flaging a planet.”

again was over her dead bodyt 



O LD Miss Barbara Noble 
twitched aside the edge 
of the white scrim cur- 
tain to get a better look at the 
young man coming down the 
street. He might be the one. 

The young man bent a little 
under the weight of the battered 
black suitcase as he crossed Ma- 
ple and started up Prospect on 
Miss Noble’s side. She could see 
him set the case down on the 



wide porch of the Raney house 
and wipe his forehead with a 
handkerchief. Then she lost sight 
of him as he advanced to the 
door. He could be a visitor to the 
Raney’s, but they were out of 
town on vacation. He could be 
a salesman. 

Miss Barbara shifted her rock- 
er to the other side of the window 
where she could watch without 
having to disturb the curtain. 



Illustrated by HASH 



THE TRAP 



101 



This second- floor sitting room 
made an excellent lookout. She 
quickly scanned the street in the 
other direction, but there was 
no sign of movement in the hot 
sunlight. She settled down to 
watch the black suitcase sitting 
uncommunicatively at the edge of 
the porch. 

It must have been all of two 
minutes before the young man 
appeared from under the over- 
hanging roof and picked up the 
case. A persistent fellow. He went 
down to the sidewalk and ap- 
proached her own house, came 
up on her own front doorstep, 
tried to set the case down on the 
narrow stoop, couldn’t, straight- 
ened up and rang the bell. A 
raucous buzz filled the sitting 
room. 

T> ARBARA Noble leaned to- 
ward the window, pulled 
back the curtain a scant inch, 
and studied his back as he looked 
at the windows on the other side 
of the front door. Limp yellow 
hair and a big perspiration stain 
in the middle of a dark sport 
shirt were her chief impressions. 
He could be a bona fide salesman 
working hard at it. She wouldn't 
let him in, of course ; but she felt 
a little sorry for him -lugging that 
big case around in this weather. 
Then he turned and looked 
straight at the window behind 
which she was hiding, and she 



let the curtain go suddenly. Had 
he seen it move? The buzzer 
sounded again, imperiously. 

Miss Barbara got up stiffly, 
moved to the big vizer screen in 
the nearest corner, and switched 
it on. The man might have some- 
thing interesting and she couldn’t 
get out to shop the way she used 
to. She smoothed her lilac house- 
dress and left the room to descend 
the stairs to the front door. 

In the tiny front hall she hesi- 
tated, then opened the door in- 
ward about eight inches. Deftly 
the man stuck the broad brown 
toe of his shoe into the opening 
and looked down at her. She grin- 
ned as she saw his. expression of 
shock. 

She was old, really old. Her 
sparse white hair was pulled so 
tightly into a knob on top of her 
head that the plentiful wrinkles 
on her forehead and around her 
eyes seemed to run vertically, 
giving her an oriental look. The 
hand she rested on the door jamb 
was a waxy-white claw, a blue 
vein standing up prominently 
under the skin tight -drawn over 
gnarly finger joints. He had prob- 
ably never seen a woman much 
past middle age. 

“Well?” Her croak was high 
and rough. 

ri^HE young man recovered 
himself and began his spiel. 
“Madame, I represent one of the 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



best- known and most reputable 
firms in the country. Our prod- 
ucts have received three interna- 
tional medals for purity and ef- 
fective performance. They . 

“What are you selling, young 
man?” 

“I have the privilege of being a 
field representative for Taffeta 
Beauty Aids. Please accept this 
generous ten-ounce bottle of our 
Diamond Dew Refreshest Lo- 
tion . He reached into his side 
pocket and brought it out, of- 
fered it with the most apprecia- 
tive smile, his ‘you hardly need 
this’ smile. 

Her hand did not reach out* “I 
don’t want any. Goodbye!” The 
door tightened against his foot. 

“But madame,” his foot did 
not budge and his smile became 
both engaging and pleading, “all 
I ask is a chance to show you 
our line. Our products sell them- 
selves. Besides, I'm paid on a 
demonstration basis — so much for 
every potential customer who 
receives our free sample and so 
much for every home demonstra- 
tion. You wouldn’t want me to 
lose two-fifty when it would take 
only six and a third minutes of 
your time exactly to look over 
one of the most amazing displays 
ever . 

“Well, I don't know . 

“I know you’ll enjoy watching 
our Tissue Cleanser in action and 
seeing the new simplicity of our 



Home Re- . (oops, he’d al- 
most said it) . Hair Relus- 
trification Kit. I promise you 
that your few minutes won’t be 
wasted.” 

“Yours would be, young man. 
I don’t buy that stuff.” 

“You may be one of the lucky 
few women who don’t need our 
products, but I don’t think you 
can say that before you’ve seen 
them.” 

“I never did see such persist- 
ence, honest to goodness!” Her 
face assumed a crabbed smile. 
“Come along then.” 

HE moved back from the door 
into the darkness of the house; 
and the salesman shifted his case 
back to his left hand, pushed the 
front door wide and took a quick 
long step inside. He was just in 
time to hear the slight click of the 
closing of a second door in front 
of him. He reached for the knob, 
turned it ; but the door was lock- 
ed. The outside door still stood 
open, caught by the end of the 
sample case. 

The July daylight from outside 
showed him that he was in a 
tiny entrance hall not more than 
forty inches each way. He pulled 
the case in and by squeezing 
against the inner door allowed the 
front door to close. Anyhow, he 
was inside the ^ouse. He rapped 
sharply on the inner door. 

The latch on the front door 



THE TRAP 



103 



snapped to and instantly the hall 
was flooded with light from a 
tremendous bulb in the ceiling, 
which, surprisingly, was twenty 
feet above him. 

A harsh voice, tinny with tre- 
mendous amplification but unmis- 
takably that of the old woman, 
filled the hall, “all right, young 

MAN. I HAVE THE VIZER TURNED 
ON YOU. LET’S SEE THE DEMON- 
STRATION. I BELIEVE YOU SAID SIX 
MINUTES. GET ON WITH IT.” 

Screening his eyes with his 
fingers, the salesman scanned the 
walls and ceiling for the vizer 
lens, found it beside the five-hun- 
dred watt bulb pouring blinding- 
ly down on him, on the other 
side of a speaker grille. 

“C-certainly, madamc." What 
a layout. As he automatically 
laid his case on the floor and 
opened back the top against the 
front door, his eyes searched the 
walls for indications of openings 
which might mean unexpected de- 
fenses such as anesthetic tanks. 
The only breaks in the two 
smooth white plaster surfaces 
which he could see as he squatted 
before the case were a horizontal 
row of glass bosses on each side 
at about the height of his knees. 

“Now, since my face,” he 
closed his eyes and flashed a 
toothy smile, like a video actor, 
up at the vi2er lens, “is subjected 
to the daily care of Taffeta Prod- 
ucts,” he turned his face down 



to the case and gritted his teeth, 
“I must smear facial muscle soft- 
ener into the left half to show 
the action and appearance of 
muscles which have lost their 
tonus.” He whipped the cover off 
a small ivorine jar and rubbed 
his cheek vigorously with a 
brownish salve. “You will note 
that this softener also contains a 
percentage of grime which lodges 
in the pores.” 

He heard a gasp from the 
speaker grille when he displayed 
a faoe whose left cheek and brow 
were sagged, wrinkled and hide- 
ously brown speckled. From 
somewhere behind the gasp, he 
heard a continuous tinkle of tiny 
bells. 

His hands moved among the 
bottles and jars, raised a round 
silver box which he held up. 
“The delicately perfumed appli- 
cator pads for all applications of 
Taffeta Preparations are pre-sat - 
urated with Firmol Tone Charger. 
I dip the pad into this solution 
of Enhancing Hyssop,” he did 
so, “and work it gently into the 
pores. The results are instantan- 
eous!” He turned up his original 
video star appearance. 

Vtf/HILE bending his body for- 
ward to reach the articles 
strapped to the top of the case, he 
noticed that the tone of the dis- 
tant bells was raised. Screwing a 
circular hairbrush to the thread

IDS 



of a collapsible tube, he sank back 
on his haunches. The bell tones 
were lower. He placed a hand on 
one of the glass bosses nearest 
the inner door, apparently to 
steady himself. An even lower 
tone was added to the bell notes. 
Obviously electric eyes with a set 
of bell signals in the old woman’s 
present location. He smiled down 
at the floor — to himself. 

“Now I want you to notice 
closely this object which I will 
show you.” He held up the brush 
with the tube screwed on its back 
and turned it about. “Do you 
know what this is?” 

There was no answer from the 
speaker but its own hum and the 
tinkle of the bells. “What does 
it look like?” He spoke rapidly, 
pleasantly. There was still no 
answer. 

He rose quickly and tried the 
knob of the inner door again. He 
could hear the bell notes lower 
in pitch as he pressed against the 
door. 

“let me see the thing again, 

YOUNG MAN. HONEST TO GOOD- 
NESS, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT 
MAKE WHETHER OR NOT I KNOW 
WHAT IT IS? IT LOOKS LIKE A 
HAIRBRUSH WITH SOME DO- JIGGER 
ON THE TOP.” 

He jumped back to the center 
of the hall. “This- brush is the 
essential feature of our sensa- 
tional Hair Relustrifier Kit. The 
tube screwed to the top feeds the 



specially developed Brilliancette ! 
directly through each hollow j 
bristle to reach every part of the ; 
hair.” He ran or rather scrubbed | 
the brush through the right side 
of his long fair pompadour with 
small rotary motions. When he 
removed the brush, that side of 
his head was covered with crisp 
yellow ringlets which shone un- 
der the light like sculptured gold. 

“THAT’S SOME SORT OF A TRICK! 
DO IT ON THE OTHER . Her 
voice was interrupted by a syn- 
copated clicking. A telephone sig- 
nal. “just a moment, young 
man.” The hum of the speaker 
cut off and the sudden silence ' 
seemed full of the echoes of the j 
bells. j 

I NSTANTLY the man dropped 
the gadget into the case and 
grabbed a handful of cleansing i 
tissues from a box in it. He i 
snapped down the top of the ! 
case and whipped the straps 1 
through the buckles. Then he 
shoved the case against one of 
the side walls and sat on it to ! 
flip off his shoes and socks. Shov- 
ing his back tightly against the 
wall, he bent his knees up and 
pushed his bare feet flat against 
the other. After placing the wad 
of tissues in his lap, he put his 
hands against the wall below his 
buttocks and, like an experienced 
mountain climber, inched his 
way rapidly up the ‘chimney’ of 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the hall. When his head touched 
the ceiling, he braced himself 
firmly with his left hand and 
reached with his right for the tis- 
sues in his lap. Protecting his 
hand with several of the white 
papers, he felt above him for the 
base of the light bulb, unscrewed 
it, and dropped it gently onto the 
rest of the tissues still in his lap. 
The sudden blackness was smoth- 
ering. ( 

Heat seeped through the tis- 
sues more rapidly than he had 
expected; and the effort to keep 
his knees from contracting and 
spilling him in the utter darkness 
to the floor fifteen feet below was 
agony. 

When he finally reached the 
floor, he placed the bulb on it be- 
side the sample case. Then he 
opened the front door and closed 
it again, leaving the door caught 
open a fraction of an inch by 
the latch against the frame. Tak- 
ing an anesthetic cartridge out 
of his pants pocket, he broke the 
seal, taking care not to trigger it, 
and returned to his crevice-climb- 
ing posture. He lifted himself 
again above the row of electric 
eyes and waited, cartridge in 
hand, leg muscles cramping pain- 
fully. 

\ FTER Miss Noble had 
turned off the speakphone, 
she pulled herself away from the 
fascinating view of golden curls 



and scuttled. over to a stiff ladder- 
back chair beside the telephone 
stand. She lifted the antique cra- 
dle phone (none of these modern 
invasions of privacy like the vi- 
zerphone) and spoke warily into 
the mouthpiece. 

“Who is it? What do you 
want?” 

“Barbara?” A man’s voice was 
urgent. 

“This is Miss Noble speaking,” 
she replied haughtily. 

The voice was savage. “Well, 
this is Doctor Harris, then. Have 
you looked at the mail today? I 
got my directors’ meeting notice 
this morning.” 

“Yes, I got one. The fifth of 
August,” she said impatiently. 

“And this seems to be our year. 
There’s been a girl here already 
this morning with some story 
about my having advertised for a 
housekeeper. She told it to the 
doorphone and wouldn’t leave 
when I said I didn’t want any- 
body — but it only took one drop 
of skunk oil in the hallway to 
send her packing.” The horrid 
chuckle that came from the re- 
ceiver was so raucous that Miss 
Noble held it away from her ear. 

“Blonde or brunette?” she 
asked noncommittally. 

“Blonde — and really young, 
not a damn rejuvenee!” 

“Rod Harris! You actually 
went and peeked at her, you old 
goat!” 



THE TRAP 



107 



"Only through the one-way.” 

"Well, since the company 
knows that a pretty girl is still 
good bait for an old ninny, you’re 
as good as a goner. They’ll have 
you rejuvenated before long.” 

"They won’t get a chance to! 
And I’m going to get old enough 
so I can’t even lift a hand to 
thumb my nose at the company. 
Then I’m going to go and die 
and the Juvine Perpetual Youth 
Corporation will scream in agony 
as it disbands and makes public 
property of its hallowed formulas 
as per the original articles of 
incorporation . and you will 
probably get a new set of false 
teeth and take the treatment 
again since you could get it real 
cheap when the monopoly’s fin- 
ished and not have to disturb 
your millions salted away in the 
sugar bowl.” 

This mixture of facetiousness 
and downright sarcasm was only 
surpassed by Miss Noble, who 
snapped back, "Don’t you sneer 
at me. Doctor Roland Harris, 
when you know perfectly well 
that the only reason I have to go 
on living this long is to make 
sure that you are really dead 
first. You didn’t invent rejuvena- 
tion all by yourself without the 
aid of Barbara Noble, Ph.D., and 
the company has the sole right 
to the process until we’re both 
dead. And, if you start peeking 
at plump blonde wenches at this 



point, I suppose I’ll have to live 
till Los Alamos freezes over!” 
“All right, all right. But she 
wasn’t plump. She wasn’t any 
bigger than you are. Besides, you 
know I’d rather have dinner with 
you. My man Marko could give 
us roast beef with all the fixings 
and afterward I want you to hear 
my latest discovery. It’s the best 
damn extempore -singer you’ve 
ever heard, Jeery Wade — fellow 
in his first late fifties, no fluff - 
brain of a juvenee— a blood and 
thunder baritone that’ll lift that 
knob of hair clean off your scalp. 
Let’s say you get here about six- 
thirty and I’ll phone him we’ll 
be over at his place for a session 
of hollering about eight.” 

M ISS Noble’s scorn needed no 
vizer to carry it over the 
wire in full force. "I’m not going 
to budge out of this house until 
after the director’s meeting and 
then only if the shops stop all 
delivery service. This time I’m 
not taking any chances. Life is 
too much of a bore to have to 
put up with it for another eighty 
years even for your marvelous 
singer who would probably go 
and get rejuvenated just as I got 
'to enjoy him. And nothing could 
induce me to listen to an evening 
of your stories for the nine hun- 
dredth time. If there’s one thing 
I’m thankful for in this scatter- 
brained age, it’s the marriage 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



dissolution law that’s got me 
free from your anecdotes after 
three separate terms of fifty years 
each.” 

“Now, Barbara, was it that 
bad?” Roland Harris sounded 
distressed. 

“Do you really think I could 
be honestly grateful to the Cor- 
poration for a hundred and fifty 
years of listening to that dis- 
graceful old thing about the 
Martian, the Venusian, and the 
robot?” 

“Well, if you feel that way 
about it, I’ll keep my discoveries 
to myself. I hope your fancy 
hallway keeps you safe till you 
rot.” -' , 

“It’s doing all right,” replied 
the old woman smugly. “I have 
a young pup down there right 
now cooling his number thirteens 
and waiting to pretend to interest 
me in some new face paint and 
hair gik. My electric eye set and 
vizer are less repulsive than your 
skunk oil and twice as effective.” 

“They're not going to stop me 
from having a good time while I 
last, anyhow. I think they’re 
through with me for today; and 
I’m going to hear Jeery Wade, 
anyhow. He’ll make up a hooting 
good song about all this when I 
tell him.” 

“Take care of yourself, Rod . 
goodbye,” said Miss Noble, al- 
most concernedly. 

She dropped the phone into its 



cradle, rose, and went back to 
the vizer screen, switching on the 
speaker as she sat down. Only 
then did she notice that the 
screen was entirely dark except 
for a vague sliver of gray. 

“Are you still there, young 
man?” she asked the microphone. 

There was silence from the 
speaker. The hammer on each 
bar of the long metal xylophone 
of the electric ey? signal hung 
motionless. 

“He’s gone . and left the 
front door unlatched too. And I 
thought he was persistent.” She 
was disappointed. “He owes me 
four more minutes of fun.” 

She got up slowly and started 
fpr the door. “That curly hair 
stuff is new since my last sixties, 
too. I wonder if it would work 
on white hair ... I’d better go 
down and close the door. Can’t 
have just anybody coming into 
one’s house.” 

S HE descended the stairs, 
opened the door from the 
front room, then took one step 
forward into the hall. Before she 
could interpret the soft bump of 
the salesman’s bare feet as they 
struck the floor, she was encircled 
by his strong arm; and the hiss of 
the anesthetic gun was loud in 
the small area of the hall. Limply 
she sagged against his arm. 

The hissing of the gun stopped. 
The young man slipped it into 



THE TRAP 



109 



his pocket and,, turning, thrust 
the inner door wide open with 
his now free hand. Entering the 
tidy front room, he kicked the 
door shut behind him and gulped 
in the good air before he headed 
for the back of the house, cra- 
dling the small body easily in his 
arms. Failing to find there what 
he was looking for, he went up 
the narrow white -railed stairway 
to the second floor. Across the 
landing, the gleam of porcelain 
showed through a half -open 
door. 

He laid his burden carefully 
on the vari -colored braided rug 
by the tub and began to draw a 
warm bath, testing the tempera- 
ture frequently with his hand. 
When water reached the over- 
flow outlet, he turned off the tap 
and sprinted downstairs for his 
sample case. The hall was still 
chokingly full of gas; and after 
grabbing out the case, he slam- 
med the door again. He brought 
the case up to the bathroom, 
where he opened it on the floor 
beside the form of the old wo- 
man. He lifted out the tray, re- 
vealing masses of silvery tubing 
and a number of flasks of iri- 
descent solutions nestling among 
loops of rubber insulated wiring. 
One flask he emptied into the 
bath, making the 'water seethe 
and turn a cloudy green. 

Then, dashing down the stairs 
again, he began looking for the 



telephone. His search became 
more and more hurried, as he 
opened cupboards and drawers 
in front room and kitchen with 
no success. Returning upstairs, 
he almost missed the instrument 
in the sitting-room because he 
was expecting the familiar sight 
of a round vizer screen. He stood 
over the phone and dialed. 
“Hey, Alice!” 

“What luck, Riggy?” 

“I’m in. The old lady’s out cold 
on the bathroom floor. Primer 
solution’s in the bath at five 
above tepid. I'm shoving her in 
now — with all her clothes on, of 
course — and I’ve wasted a lot of 
time already looking for this hy- 
poblastic phone, so beat it on 
over here with Margy and get to 
work.” 

“Are you ordering me around, 
Rigel O’Maffey?” 

“You know I never did this 
job on a woman. And don’t for- 
get, honey, we’ll get enough out 
of this to get a new copter to- 
gether. C’mon now.” He put the 
phone back in the cradle before 
she could answer. 

1>ACK in the bathroom, he drew 
a long thermometer from the 
case, took a careful reading on 
the water, ran in a little more hot 
from the faucet and left it run- 
ning the slightest dribble. 

Carefully lifting the small 
body of Barbara Noble, Ph.D., 



110 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



he slid it gently into the water 
feet first over the end, smoothing 
down with one hand the percale 
housed ress which ballooned as 
she went into the water. Finally 
he knelt beside the tub, holding 
her head out of the water in the 
crook of his elbow. 

A banging on the inner door 
downstairs some fifteen minutes 
later reminded him of the force 
with which he had slammed it in 
his hurry to reach the uncontami- 
nated air of the front room. He 
looked longingly across the bath- 
room at the racks of towels on 
the other side, but finally, as the 
banging stopped and a feminine 
voice began yelling, “Hey, Riggy! 
Let us in!” he grabbed up the 
bright rug and wadded it under 
the scrawny neck. 

The girls scolded him all the 
way up the stairs for not leaving 
the door unlocked, while he tried 
to explain, at the same time, that 
he had to hold up the woman’s 
head. 

“Screepers, Riggy, what do you 
think the perfectly good pair of 
water-wings in your case is for?”’ 

Humbled, he departed as the 
girls took over the beginning of 
the complicated, fortnight-long 
process of the rejuvenation of 
Barbara Noble. 

riiHE receptionist behind the 
ebony desk, whose gold plate 
proclaimed it as the headquarters 



of the Juvine Perpetual Youth 
Corporation, crammed shut the 
drawer before her. A metallic 
clink from within was the fall 
of a mirror with which she had 
been assisting the application of 
scarlet which now fluoresced 
gently on her full lips. 

Tossing her head (which 
showed the crop of glistening 
black curls to the fullest advan- 
tage) in a preoccupied manner, 
she addressed the man who stood 
before her desk. “How can the 
Juvine Perpetual Youth Corpor- 
ation serve you ?' 7 Her hastily 
assumed look of efficient im- 
portance was replaced by melting 
eagerness as she took in the chis- 
elled perfection of features and 
the broad shoulders of the young 
man in knife-creased bronze 
spunlon. 

“I’m Harris. For the directors’ 
meeting.” His voice was curt. 

“ You’re Doctor Harris? The 
Director? Oh, do come in.” She 
rose from the desk and went 
around the end of it to open the 
high wrought- gold gate and hold 
it wide for him. “You’re a little 
early. I’ll take you down to the 
Board Room.” Eager willingness 
to help was apparent in her 
every gesture. 

“Thanks, I know the way,” he 
informed her, brushing past. 

She followed him, however, 
across the patio-like reception 
room, with its exotically gardened

borders and splashing fountain, 
down th.e' long corridor past glow- 
ing murals of men and women 
swimming, dancing and playing 
tennis, past tapestry shielded 
doorways to the great bright arch 
at the end. Before he went 
through, she caught his sleeve. 

“I should be pleased to steno 
for you today, if you need me.” 
He turned and looked at her 
as if he had not known she was 
behind him. “Thanks, but I 
sha’n’t need one. It’ll be a short 
meeting.” He smiled down and 
patted her cheek. “But if I’m not 
entirely satisfied with the pro- 
ceedings, maybe I can dictate a 
little afterward.” 

She laughed as if that were a 
special joke between them and 
retreated rapidly down the cor- 
ridor before he had time to turn 
and miss the splendor of her 
graceful carriage. 

His eyebrows were still raised 
and the corners of his mouth 
curved in appreciation when he 
passed through the arch and into 
the vast room under the clear 
bubble of a tremendous skydome. 

A GIRL was sitting there, her 
back to him, looking out 
over the simmering city streets 
to the cool rise of mountains be- 
yond. He recognized ' at once the 
slight figure, the sheen of the 
long curling auburn bob, the 
poise of her head and slim hand 



resting on the arm of the chair. 

“Babst” 

She turned half around. “Hello, 
Rod.” 

He grinned and sank down in 
the next chair. “Here we are 
again.” 

“Knocked out by your own 
skunk oil?” she asked pointedly. 

“No. Company copter man got 
me leaving Jeery Wade’s. What 
happened to you? I thought you 
were walled up neatly for the de- 
clining years.” 

“The cosmetic man ambushed 
me in the hall. But I’ve got an- 
other fifty years to figure out 
something better ... if I still 
need it.” 

“What do you mean if you 
still need it? Are you changing 
your mind about rejuvenation?” 

She smiled. “Well, you know 
it’s always fun at first. But I’m 
having my lawyer come to this 
meeting. I’ve got an idea we can 
change the articles of agreement 
so that the process can finally 
become public property at the 
end of another fifty years instead 
of only after our deaths. Then if 
we want to go on and die, no- 
body” (she waved her hand 
around the great room at the 
little group of athletic men and 
glamorous, expensively gowned 
women moving in through the 
arch) “nobody will have any fi- 
nancial interest in rejuvenating 
us. Then, too, our own fat in- 



112 



GALAXY SCIENCI FICTION 



comes will lapse ; and since that’s 
the reason we set up the articles 
the way they are — so we’d never 
be in danger of starving, that is 
— we’d have the more interesting 
choice of whether to die off or 
get young again and go back to 
work. Would you sign a fifty- 
year termination, Rod?” 

“Would you marry me for the 
fifty years, Babs?” His voice was 
gentle, pleading. 

“Honest to goodness, now, 
aren’t you really pretty tired of 
me?” she asked earnestly, turn- 
ing to face him. 

“No, I can’t say I am. You’re 
pretty special, doctor, and you’re 
special pretty.” It was a ritual. 

“You know you’re the only 
man. I’ll marry you. Will you 
sign?” 

“Of course I’ll sign. I would 
have anyhow when I knew you 
wanted me to. And Babs — may- 
be we could get some sort of jobs 
now — sort of to get in practice. 
I’ll bet we could rent a lab some- 
where and do commercial analy- 
ses for a while until we got hit 
by another idea for research.” 

“Rod, that’s the best idea 
you’ve had in the last hundred 
and fifty years. But we could 
have a honeymoon first, couldn't 
we?” 

“That’s your best suggestion 
in the last seventy years. And 
maybe we could get Jeery Wade 
and his wife to rejuvenate and go 

THS TRAP 



with us. After the first couple of 
weeks, that is.” 

rriHEY left the meeting arm in 
arm, somewhat ahead of the 
rather disgruntled group of di- 
rectors, who stayed behind to 
lament the end of a good thing. 
In the garden room, Barbara 
stopped to choose an orchid. 

Rod Harris wandered on to the 
receptionist’s desk, where thetjirl 
of the black curls waited, smnmg. 

He looked back at Barbara, 
then smiled down at the girl. 
“Just like I said . .. a short meet- 
ing. No need for any dictating. 
Lucky you.” 

“Oh, I don’t know,” she count- 
ered coyly. 

“Say, I heard a story the other 
day you might like. Do you like 
stories?” 

“What kind of story?” 

“You’d have to be the judge of 
that.” 

Suddenly Barbara was with 
them, pinning on a bronze and 
green blossom. “C’mon along, 
dear. We’ve got a good many 
things to do before we leave.” 

He opened the golden wicket 
for her and followed her out. 
Turning back toward the desk, 
he called to the girl, “I may be 
back in a few weeks to see about 
a job. Remind me then to tell 
you the one about the Martian, 
the Venusian and the robot.”

Frederik Pohl and C. M. Korn- 
bluth. Ballantine Books, Inc., 
New York, 1953. Cloth $1,50; 
paper, 350 

T HAVE waited over a year for 
a chance to say in print that 
Gravy Planet (now ineptly re- 
titled as above), which was a 
1952 serial in GALAXY, is per- 
haps the best science fiction sa- 
tire since Brave New World, 
better even than Player Piano 
and for my money vastly superior 
to the dull and overrated 1984. 

And now I have an opportunity 
to point out in addition that the 



flaws some people found in the 
magazine version, such as the 
ending on Venus, have been pol- 
ished out, so that what we now 
have is a well-nigh perfect attack 
on the stupid, the cynical, the 
mercenary, the power -crazy tend- 
encies of the Salesmen's Civiliza- 
tion. 

The story? Fowler Schocken 
Associates, advertising agency su- 
preme, steal^ the project for ex- 
ploiting the planet Venus from 
a competitor, and places Mitch 
Courtenay, star class copysmith 
who tells the story himself, in 
charge. 

Courtenay is kidnaped by the 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




competitor and nearly bumped 
off. He then finds out some home 
truths about the Consies, the sub- 
versives of the future, who are 
Conservationists. They want to 
save Venus for a naturally bal- 
anced economy rather than for 
the destructive looting of a sales- 
insane monopoly. Courtenay be- 
comes a secret Consie and turns 
Venus over to these inheritors of 
the future. 

The plot is only a small part 
of the book’s merits, though. 
Look what it has — 

Wood is so rare that “a real 
oak ring” is more valuable than 
a diamond solitaire. Space in 
Earth’s cities is so hard to find 
that the fire-stairs in skyscrapers 
are rented out (one step per cou- 
p/e) to the lower classes for 
sleeping quarters. Captive audi- 
ences are so captive that it is 
legal to drug coffee (the Fowler 
Schocken crowd have it trade - 
marked “Coffiest”) with a habit- 
forming alkaloid which costs 
$5,000 to be cured of. Govern- 
ment has fallen so completely in- 
to the hands of the corporations 
that there are Senators from Du- 
Pont, Nash-Kelvinator, Yummy- 
Cola, and so on, and the 
Presidency of the United States 
has become a hereditary and 
solely honorary office — a minor 
detail that one doesn’t discover 
till the third page from the end 
of the book! 



This is a permanent addition 
to the good books of our era. It 
is not “just another science fiction 
book,” though I am sure you will 
find some smug snobs referring 
to it as such.

rriHIS classic fantasy, first pub- 
fished in Boston in 1885, was 
written by a schoolmaster who 
specialized in literature and the- 
ology. How he ever came to write 
this charming bit of mathemat- 
ical whimsy, with its curious yet 
sharply real picture of two- 
dimensional life, has never been 
determined. 

Banesh Hoffman, who wrote an 
introduction for this new edition,

THE GOLDEN APPLES OF 
THE SUN by Ray Bradbury . 
Double day & Co. f Inc., New 
York, 1953. 250 pa^es, $3.00 

W ITH this book of 22 short 
stories, Ray Bradbury steps 
out of the class (if he ever was 
in it, which some fanatics still 
deny) of science fiction writer. 
Not more than seven of the stories 
can be labeled science fiction; I 
believe only two appeared in sci- 
ence fiction magazines. 

Bradbury is now clearly in a 
class with the great writers of 
imagination of modern times — 
not just a “special” writer for a 
“special” audience. He writes in 
every form and mood except the 
pedestrian, the formula or the 
cheap. Sometimes he may over- 
write a little, but he never writes 
badly. 

In the new book there are, I 
believe, some of the best imagina- 
tive stories he or anyone else has 
ever written. One cannot even 
begin to describe their delights; 
but one can at least mention a 
few of the ideas which Bradbury 
develops. 

There is the murderer who 
goes mad trying to polish his fin- 



gerprints off everything he may 
have touched — a horror story 
that is already a classic. 

There is the Chinese Emperor 
of the year 400 who beheaded 
one of his subjects who invented 
a man-carrying kite because it 
made the Chinese Wall worthless 
— soldiers could glide over it! 

A biting sketch describes race 
prejudices in an amateur base- 
ball game. Another tells of the 
Mexican who did not like a fash 
ion photographer using the front 
of his adobe shack as a back - 
ground for photos of young ladies 
modeling clothes, and made an 
issue of it in a magnificently un- 
answerable way. Then there is 
the lovely one about seventeen 
year-old Marianne, who had Just 
Discovered Boys. 

Quote: “She'll be all right,” 
Mother said to Father, “Girls 
only seem stupid because when 
they’re in love they can’t hear.” 

“It affects the semicircular 
canals,” said Father. “Making 
many girls fall right into a fel- 
low’s arms. I know. I was almost 
crushed to death once by a fall- 
ing woman, and let me tell 
you — ” 

And then there’s the oddly 
tragic story about the boy named 
Willie, who never grew up, and 
who always had to move from 
adopted family to adopted fam- 
ily whenever his persistent youth 
began to show.

This book presents a writer of 
genius approaching the height of 
his powers. It should not be 

missed. 

A ROCKET DRIVE FOR 
LONG RANGE BOMBERS by 
E. Sanger and I. Bredt. Robert 
Cornog, 990 Cheltenham Rd., 
Santa Barbara, Calif. 175 pages, 
$3.95 

W ILLY LEY has called my 
attention to this important 
but highly technical document 
with the remark that it is one 
of the basic works on the theory 
and practice of rocket -powered 
airplanes. It was translated from 
the German by M. Hamermesh 
of the U.S. Navy’s Radio Re- 
search Laboratory, and has been 
previously available only in pho- 
tostats at around $18.00. 

The report, which Mr. Ley 
discussed at length in Appendix 
1 of his Rockets, Missiles and 
Space Travel, 1951 edition, ex- 
plores the unique theory that a 
winged rocket, climbing at very 
high speeds and steep angle, 
would ricochet repeatedly from 
denser to thinner atmosphere 
levels, like a flat stone spinning 
over water, thus enormously in- 
creasing its flying range. 

Dr. Eugen Sanger is an Aus- 
trian engineer who once worked 
for the Herman Goering Institute 
of the Luftwaffe. Dr. Irene Bredt 

★ * * * * SHELF 



is a mathematician who helped 
Dr. Sanger in the immensely 
complex theoretical calculations 
described in the report. Today 
they are married and are living in 
Paris, working for the French 
Government’s Arsenal de l’Aero- 
nautique. Dr. Sanger is also 
president of the International As- 
tronautical Federation. 

THIS ISLAND EARTH by Ray- 
mond F . Jones. Shasta Publish- 
ers, Chicago, 1953. 220 pages, 
$3.00 

DAYMOND Jones has always 
had three major interests in 
science fiction: alien invasions, 
infiltrations or inspections of 
Earth; advanced computer-cyber- 
netic concepts; and the horrors of 
war, particularly atomic. In this 
swift-moving adventure, Jones 
combined all three interests — 
with, unfortunately, a somewhat 
less mature point of view than 
usual in his work. 

Evidences of an unbelievably 
advanced science come to the at- 
tention of electronics engineer 
Cal Meacham, He follows down 
the clues; makes an “interociter,” 
a weird communications device, 
by pursuing the mysterious leads; 
and then is transported to a 
strange new paradise for scien- 
tists in the deserts near Phoenix, 
Arizona. From then on, he is in- 
extricably involved in the strug- 



117 



gles between two great galactic 
enemies which are using Earth 
as a secret armory. 

The narrative is sharp, excit- 
ing; the science is technical, nat- 
uralistic; The plot is one of the 
oldest in any kind of adventure 
writing and the characters are 
cardboard chessmen. The tale as 
a whole is fast, fascinating and 
shallow, fine for a relaxation hour, 
but scarcely as rich and reward- 
ing as some of Jones’s more pro- 
found tales. 

MYSTERY OF THE THIRD 
MINE by Robert W. Lowndes; 
ROCKET TO LUNA by Rich- 
ard Marsten ; BATTLE ON 
MERCURY by Erik Van Lhin; 
VANDALS OF THE VOID by 
Jack Vance; THE MYSTERI- 
OUS PLANET by Kenneth 
Wright. John C. Winston Co., 
Philadelphia, 1953. Various pages, 
$2.00 each 

rriHESE five new titles in Win- 
ston’s series of science fiction 
juveniles bring the total in print 
to fifteen and also lower the av- 
erage quality of the group some- 
what. 

There is one solid item — Mar- 
sten’s Rocket to Lima ; the others 
are perilously close to comic book 
melodrama; exciting' enough, but 
not particularly well written and 
certainly not very inventive or 
real -seeming. However, they all 



make quick, exciting reading. 

Vance’s Vandals of the Void 
tells of space pirates on the Mars- 
Earth run, complete with a vil- 
lain named the Basilisk, and all 
kinds of Western-story derring- 
do. Lowndes’ Mystery of the 
Third Mine is about miners in 
the Asteroid Belt, and their strug- 
gle against the Vested Interests 
of the phony Asteroid Miners’ 
Association. 

Erik Van Lhin’s Battle on Mer- 
cury tells a bizarre tale about 
Earthian colonizers on the planet 
nearest the Sun, and how they 
win their battle against the solar 
powers with the aid of some ex- 
tremely odd forms of life that 
are electric in nature. 

The Mysterious Planet by 
Kenneth Wright is all about a 
plot to destroy Earth, and how 
a human youth, held captive on 
Planet X where the plot is 
hatched, is able to foil it. 

Even Marsten’ s book is about 
space travel, making all five simi- 
lar in basic theme — simple space 
opera. 

Rocket to Luna, however, is of 
much higher quality. It is an in- 
formative and thrilling tale of the 
first trip to the Moon, via a space 
station in an orbit around Earth, 
excellent for its vivid writing, the 
accuracy of its scientific data, 
and the realism of its carefully 
developed plot.

His secret was no secret, the 
amiable alien insisted— which 
was the cause ef the trouble! 



F lip Danielson came 

striding into his forty- 
credit-a-day suite at the 
Hotel Metro, wearing a broad 
grin and a checked suit. 

“I’ve got him right where we 
want him," he said. “He’s hang- 



ing on the ropes.” 

Stretched out on the bed with 
a wet towel swathed around his 
head like a turban, the pudgy fig- 
ure groaned and turned over, 
burying his face in the covers. 
“Go ’way. I’m a sick man."

Flip skipped across the room, 
tossed the covers aside, and 
bounced up and down on the bed. 

"Snap out of it, Potsy. I’ve got 
us an out.” 

The fat man winced at the mo- 
tion and feebly raised his head. 

“I’ll never live to use an out. 
What was I drinking last night — 
straight fusel-oil?” 

"Quang Dal was mixing cock- 
tails out of creme- de-menthe and 
anisette, and you were taking two 
to every one of his just to be so- 
ciable.” 

"That explains it,” groaned 
Potsy. “Hand me that bottle on 
the bureau, like a good fellow. 
Fve got to do something to get 
rid of that aftertaste.” 

Flip went over and got it, stop- 
ped to take a short sample him- 
self, and then, handed it over. 
There was a liquid gurgle as the 
bottle dropped an inch and a 
half, and then a satisfied sigh. 

"Maybe I’ll live, after all. Now, 
who’s on the ropes?” 

“Quang Dal. No thanks to you, 
though. You were passed out in 
the comer, snoring like a pig, 
when I rolled him.” 

rriHE fat man looked up in sud- 
den interest "How much did 
you get?” 

“Looks like about four thou- 
sand. I haven’t bothered to count 
it yet.” 

“Toss it over. I’ll be glad to.” 



“It’ll do for chicken feed.” 
Potsy clucked like a hen and 
grabbed the billfold. He pulled 
out a thick sheaf of currency and 
ran his fingers over it reverently. 

“Think of the time we can 
have — ” He broke off suddenly 
and tossed the money despond- 
ently on the floor. “Could have 
had, I mean. We won’t have any 
use for money where we’re go- 
ing. Twenty years — minimum!” 
He grabbed his head between his 
hands as it started in throbbing 
again. 

“And forty years maximum,” 
said Flip unsympathetically. 
“Next time you line up an easy 
mark, make sure she’s not the 
Police Commissioner’s mother- 
in-law.” 

“Maybe something will hap- 
pen. We’ve still got three weeks 
before we have to report for sen- 
tencing.” 

"So?” 

“We’ve still got the ship. We 
could make a run for it.” 

“Where to? If it’s any place in 
the Solar System where people 
can live, the law’s there. And if 
it’s a place where the law isn’t, 
people can’t live.” 

Potsy drank unhappily from 
his bottle. “What gets me is that 
the floppers and the crawlers and 
the wigglers and the rest can hop 
around the Galaxy in just about 
nothing flat while we humans 
can’t go past Pluto. If we could

just get our hands on one of their 
faster-than- light drives, we could 
thumb our noses at the law.” He 
sighed. “If wishes were horses . 

“Get ready to saddle up.” 
There was a complacent smile on 
Flip’s face as he tossed a long 
manila envelope on to the bed. 
“The thought of sitting in a Lu- 
nar prison cell for the next twenty 
years with nothing to look at but 
your fat face was just too much — 
so I went and did something 
about it.” 

Potsy opened the envelope and 
stared at its contents in bewilder- 
ment. 

Flip grinned. “Return ticket, 
passport, identity card — ■ the 
works. His ship takes off at ten 
and I’ve pumped enough DDT 
into him to keep him under for 
another six hours. When Quang 
Dal comes to, he’s going to be 
an unhappy little Centaurian — 
broke, stranded, and friendless. 
Do you begin to get the picture?” 

Potsy looked up at his partner 
with open admiration. “Not 
friendless. He’s got us.” 

W HEN Quang Dal’s six legs 
had recovered sufficient 
strength to carry him down the 
corridors in a tottering crawl, the 
first thing he did was to go to the 
police. 

“Get outta here before I squash 
ya,” growled the desk sergeant. 
“If w£’re such ignorant bums we 



ain’t good enough to be let in j 
your Galactic Union, we sure ] 
ain’t smart enough to help you 
out when you get into a jam.” \ 
“But, sir,” protested Quang \ 
Dal, “I am just poor priwate Cen- 
taurian citizen who have nothing 
to do with admission standards 
whatsoewer. Is not to be des- 
pairing for that, howewer. Has . 
not Grand Council giwen fine 
promise that admission shall be 
accompaniment of attainment of 
minimumnal socialization per- 
centile?” 

“Scram,” said the desk ser- 
geant. “I ain’t paid to get lectured 
by cockroaches.” 

Quang Dal drew himself up 
with dignity, “Is, one, inaccurate 
statement — terrestrial cockroach 
is not sapient being. Is, two, ob- 
viously hostile manifestation. Is 
through politeness and well wish- 
ing comes minimumnal socializa- 
tion, not harsh speaking. In 
Cosmos, all entities are siblings. 
Translation: brothers and/or sis- 
ters.” 

With a quick wabble to the 
left, he avoided the descending 
boot and scuttled toward the 
door. 

“I love you,” he said ceremo- 
niously, but earnestly. “Is well 
wishing with a wengeance.” 

At the Bureau of Extraterres- 
trial Affairs, he received a politer 
reception, but little in the way of 
help.

“Terribly sorry, old man,’’ said 
the Third Assistant. “Wouldn’t 
have had it happen for all the 
worlds. Don’t know quite what 
I can do about it, though, now 
that your ship’s gone. It was the 
first one in twenty years and 
there’s no telling when the next 
one will stop by. It is rather 
shameful the way the rest of the 
Galaxy tends to avoid us, you 
know. I mean, after all, if you 
chaps would let us in on the 
faster-than-light drive and a few 
things like that, we wouldn’t be 
so embarrassingly provincial.” 

“Are explaining many times be- 
fore,” said Quang Dal patiently. 
“Is no such thing as faster-than- 
light drive. As your good man 
Einstein show you long time ago, 
is theoretical impossibility.” 

The Third Assistant sniffed his 
disbelief. “And how many months 
has it been since you left Alpha 
Centauri?” 

“Three months between time, 
but is not workable for Solar peo- 
ples. Is only what you call a con- 
wenience.” 

The official maintained his pro- 
fessional calm, but there was a 
little edge to his voice. 

“I take it, then, that you con- 
sider us too stupid to know how 
to use it?” 

“Did not say,” said Quang Dal. 
“Is only unachievement of mini- 
raumnal socialization. Are prin- 
ciples inwolved that might be 



used for harm to other entities.” 

The Third Assistant glanced at 
his watch, rose from his desk, and 
ushered the little Centaurian to 
the door. 

“You’ll have to excuse me, old 
man.- Tea time, you know. Sorry 
I can’t offer you a lift home on 
one of our ships, but since we’ve 
never been able to do better than 
one-fifth light speed, I’m afraid 
that we’ll just have to putter 
around inside our own solar sys- 
tem until you chaps decide we’re 
socialized enough to be given the 
galactic drive. I’ll make a per- 
sonal note of your case, however, 
and when an extraterrestrial ship 
drops in, one of my successors 
will get in touch with you imme- 
diately,” 

Quang Dal’s attempt to explain 
again that there was no such 
thing as a faster-than-light drive 
was cut short by the closing of 
the door in his face. Rearing up 
on his hind legs, he ran his voice 
tube through the keyhole and 
said politely, “Note, please — I 
love you.” 

TTIS only friends in a strange 
and hostile world, Potsy and 
Flip, were waiting for him when 
he got back to the hotel. 

“How did it go?” 

“Is, as you say, without soap,” 
said Quang Dal mournfully. “Is 
constant expectoration upon by 
unwell -wishers.”

“Don’t let it get you down, 
pal,” comforted Potsy, "What do 
you expect from a bunch of bums 
with a low-grade socialization in- 
dex?*’ He reached in his pocket, 
pulled out a bulging billfold, and 
peeled off several bills. “Here’s a 
little ready cash. Just remember 
that no matter what happens, 
you’ve still got us.” 

Flip nodded his agreement. 
“What’s ours is yours. It may be 
fifty years before another galac- 
tic ship stops by, and even then 
it may be going the wrong way, 
but we’ll stand by you!” 

“If fifty years, .not too bad,” 
said Quang Dal. “Is sewenty-five, 
is too late, I think so maybe. Is 
now Ides of March. Would be 
most inconweniencing to spouses- 
to-be if not returning by June. Is 
getting married then,” he explain- 
ed, “and sewening no good with 
only six.” 

“If you’re saying what I think 
you’re saying,” Potsy said, sym- 
pathetically, “you're in a tough 
spot. If you’ve got to wait fifty 
years, it won’t be much of a mar- 
riage.” 

“Yeah,” agreed Flip. “I can 
just see the poor girls waiting for 
their lover to come home, hope- 
fully setting a light in their win- 
dows each night, slowly losing 
hope as the years pass— growing 
lined and gray and bitter with 
the thoughts of what might have 
been.” 



“Is many misconceptions here,” 
said Quang Dal. “In first place, is 
not year question, is month ques- 
tion. In second, is not females on 
Alpha Centauri same kind like 
Earth. Is seven sexes. I am sptan- 
ton, number four kind.” He went 
into a detailed description of re- 
lations and permutations that left 
the two Earthmen confused. 

“If this is what is meant by 
being socialized,” said Potsy fi- 
nally, “I don’t see how Earth will 
ever make it.” 

“l^OTSY,” Flip said, “if our 
friend has to be home by 
June to get married, we’re going 
to see that he makes it. Like he’s 
always saying, all entities are 
siblings under the epidermis.” 
“I’m all for it,” said his part- 
ner, “but how?” 

“We’ve got a ship, haven’t we?” 
“Yeah, but without the galac- 
tic drive, it would take him twen- 
ty years to get back and he’s due 
in June.” 

“He can make it,” said Flip 
confidently. “All he has to do is 
build one of those faster-than- 
light gadgets and install it in the 
ship. Then he could make it back 
in time.” 

“Is not faster than light,” ob- 
jected Quang Dal once more. “Is 
merely conwenience. But if loan- 
ation of ship could be made, 
would be well-wishing with a 
wengeance and impressive sign of

rwiHREE weeks later, the job 
■*- was done. 

"Is all fix and workable fine,"' 
said Quang Dal. “You come down 
and see me off in morning. Is 
needful to express final love and 
gratitude/’ 

“Wouldn’t mjss it for the 
world,” said Flip. 

“I think I go make last-time 
checkup.” 

When he left, Potsy pulled off 
his shoes and stretched on the bed. 

“Looks like we’ll make it/* 

“Just in time, too,” said Flip. 
“In case you’ve forgotten, we’re 
due down at the Justice Depart- 
ment at noon tomorrow for sen- 
tencing.” He shuddered. “Twenty 
years would have been a long 
time!” 

“Not as long as forty,” said 
Potsy. “I think I’ll have a bottle 
sent up. I feel like celebrating.” 

“Excellent idea. Order up five 
women while you’re at it. We owe 
it to our race to see if we can get 
onto this sevening.” 

At eight sharp the next morn- 
ing, the two were standing in the 
control room of their spaceship 
listening to Quang Dal’s last 
grateful good-bys. 

“It’s nothing at all,” said Flip. 
“We’d do the same for any friend. 
How about showing us around 
before you take off?” 



Quang Dal thought for a mo- 
ment and then quivered assent. 

“Would be no real wiolation of 
Galactic Union order. Secret 
things are all behind panels.” 
The control room had been 
considerably altered. In place of 
the complicated banks of con- 
trols that had flanked the pilot’s 
seat, there were two push buttons 
set in a simple black box. 

“This one take care of nawiga- 
tion,” explained Quang Dal. “One 
push, I go home. Start, go, stop — 
whole thing automatical. Could 
not change course if wanted to.” 
“You don’t have to tell us what 
the other one controls,” said Pot- 
sy. “One push and WHOOSH, 
Alpha Centauri in June.” 

“Is not whoosh. Is putt-putt- 
putt. Wery conweniervt, though.” 
“Well, I guess we’re ready,” 
said Potsy. “Do you want to do 
the honors. Flip, or shall I?” 

“Is not understanding,” Quang 
Dal equivalently frowned. 

“Didn’t you tell him?” asked 
Flip. 

“I thought he'd take it for 
granted. After all, somebody has 
to bring the ship back.” 

Quang Dal reared up on. his 
back four legs in an agitated fash- 
ion. 

“Accompaniment cannot be, 
sweet entities. Is not only Gal- 
actic Union law wiolation, but not 
possible for two-legged human 
peoples,”

F LIP produced a large and vi- 
cious-looking gun. 

“Anything bugs can do, we can 
do better. Get aft before I splat- 
ter you against the bulkhead!” 
“Weapon-using is sign of low 
soci a li ration,” said Quang Dal 
with regret and pity. 

“Are you talking or walking?” 
demanded Flip, sighting down 
the barrel of his gun. 

“Is terrible thing you doing,” 
warned the little Centaurian as 
he backed out of the control 
room. “You have no right to do 
this to selves.” 

Potsy walked over to the con- 
trol box. He reached out to press 
the first button and then hesi- 
tated. 

“What if something should 
happen?” he asked worriedly. 

“Couldn’t be worse than twen- 
ty years in a Lunar isolation cell,” 
said Flip. “You can stay behind 
if you want to, but I’m getting 
out of here.” 

Potsy still hesitated. Finally he 
came back and sat down. 

“You push it,” he offered. 

Flip snorted in disgust and 
tossed his gun over to his partner. 
“Go on back and lock our little 
friend up in the aft stateroom. If 
we let him run around loose, he 
might get into mischief. I’ll take 
care of things up here.” • 

When Potsy had left the com- 
partment, Flip took a deep 
breath, walked over to the con- 



trol box, and slowly pushed the 
first button. The results weren’t 
spectacular. There was a hum of 
lifters as the ship rose slowly, and 
then, with a gentle push, they 
were off. Once out of the atmos- 
phere, the ship pointed its nose 
toward Alpha Centauri and began 
to pick up speed. 

Potsy came back into the con- 
trol room and took a quick look 
out the side port to where the 
Moon hung like a great pock- 
marked balloon. The penal col- 
ony itself couldn’t be seen, but 
Lunaport was visible as a small 
glittering splotch. 

He gave a little shiver and 
turned away. 

“Everything under control?” 

“So far. Do you think I ought 
to hit the other stud?” 

Potsy shook his head. “The 
galactic ships never seem to use 
their drives until they are far 
enough away to be out of detec- 
tion range. There must be a rea- 
son for it. Maybe the gadget 
blows up if it’s set off near a 
sun.” 

They waited two days before 
Flip pressed the second button. 
There was a low whine from be- 
neath the deck and then a squeal 
of fright from Potsy as a nerve - 
scraping vibration ran through 
the ship. A strange mistiness cov- 
ered everything, as though the 
matter of which the ship was 
composed were turning to noth-

ingness and then back again a 
thousand times a second. 

With a final shudder, the ship 
returned to normal. 

Potsy gave a sigh of relief and 
mopped his forehead. “Well, we’re 
still in one piece. And I guess 
we’re finally on our way.” 

“Go let Quang Dal out,” said 
Flip. “If these controls are as 
completely automatic as he says, 
he can’t do us any harm now.” 
Potsy came back five minutes 
later, alone. 

“He’s got his door locked from 
the inside. He says that he’s going 
to take a little nap and we should 
wake him come June.” 

Flip shrugged. “If that’s the 
way he wants it.” 

A S the weeks crawled slowly 
by, the two Earthmen found 
themselves growing more and 
more irritable. 

“I think I’d almost prefer the 
Lunar prison colony,” said Potsy. 

“Oh, well,” growled Flip, 
“we’ve only got two weeks left. I 
guess I can stand your ugly face 
that long.” 

Potsy gestured toward Alpha 
Centauri which glimmered palely 
directly ahead. “You’d think it 
would be getting bigger by now.” 
“It’ll Stay like that almost to 
the end,” said Flip. “The way I 
got it figured, we’re going so fast

before it has a chance to get in,

If you want to see the difference, 
go take a look through the rear 
’scope. The Sun should be out of

Potsy trotted obediently to the 
rear and took a look out through 
the aft telescope. A moment later, 
he returned and asked in a timid 
and somewhat frightened voice, 
“If the Sun’s supposed to be so 
far away, how come I can still 
see most of the planets?” 

“Huh? You can?” Flip looked 
nervous as Potsy nodded. “That 
lousy little bug must have given 
us cockeyed instructions, know- 
ing the galactic drive is Greek to 
us.” 

“But why should he?” 

“How do I know? Maybe he 
wants us to break our necks some 
way while he’s safe in his cabin. 
Well, I'll break his if he doesn’t 
.give us the right dope!” 

“Go easy,” Patsy advised anx- 
iously. “Try to con the informa- 
tion out of him first. Then let 
him have it if he won’t talk.” 
After considerable pounding, 
they managed to wake Quang 
Dal. His voice tube poked out 
through the grille at the top of 
his locked door and he asked po- 
litely, “Is June already?” 

“No,” said Flip, “it’s only the 
middle of May. Potsy and I are 
sorry to have to wake you up, but 
something seems to have gone 
wrong with the drive. Would you 
mind coming out and fixing it?" 

127 



“Is nothing wrong,” replied 
Quang Dal. “Can hear with prop- 
emess from here. Sound smooth.” 
“The planetary drive is on, all 
right, but the faster- than-light 
didn’t cut in. After all this time, 
we’re still only a stone’s throw 
from Earth. We should be almost 
to Alpha Centauri by now.” 

T HERE was silence within the 
stateroom for a minute. “Is 
unhappiness to say this,” the lit' 
tie Centauri an said regretfully, 
“but * as I explain past times, 
faster-than-light drive is theo- 
retical impossibility. Galactic 
Union scientists work two, maybe 
three million years now. For all 
this time, nothing, except once in 
a while little conwenience. Is still 
taking twenty years going Earth, 
Alpha Centauri, or wice-wersa.” 
“Then how in hell do you ex- 
pect to get home in three 
months?” 

“Is three months between time, 
not three months pass time. 
Wery different things,” said 
Quang Dal, “Between time is 
from little conwenience I tell you 
before about. With it, can take 
trip maybe two hundred years 
and still not be away from family 
too long. Wery fine conwenience.” 
“Two hundred years!” gasped 
Potsy. 

“Is one other thing which 
you mistake for faster-than-light 
drive. Old galactic peoples like 



Centauri ans live thirty-five, may- 
be forty thousands Earth years. 
Would not be socialized to tell 
poor Earth two-legged stander- 
uppers they live and die same 
thing like I get up and go bed. Is 
not well-wishing to make other 
entities unhappy. Would not tell 
you this, only I think you un- 
happier if I do not explain. So 
sorry.” 

Flip stood rigid, his brain 
freezing as the cold and horrid 
truth began to seep in. 

“Then the second button . 

“Is biggest conwenience. Faster- 
than-light drive impossible, but 
not time travel. Push second but- 
ton, whole ship come back nine- 
teen years, nine months. Could 
make it exactly same time of 
same year we leave Earth when 
we reach Alpha Centauri, but I 
like better awaken at time of 
sewening, so I set controls for 
June ” 

His voice was drowsier. 

“You will wake me in June, 
kindly? Until, I take small nap 
— only twenty years. Apologizing 
that you cannot do likewise.” 

Quang Dal’s voice was almost 
inaudible as he withdrew his 
voice tube from the grille. 

“Is wishing well with a wen- 
geance,” he said, too conditioned 
to politeness to let weariness ex- 
cuse him from the ritual of fare- 
well. “Note, please — I love you.”

T EN minutes after the 
crackup, somebody phoned 
for the Army. That meant 
us. The black smoke of the fire, 
and the oily residues, which were 
later analyzed, proved the pres- 
ence of a probable petroleum de- 
rivative. The oil was heavily 
tainted with radioactivity. Most 
likely it was fuel from the odd, 
conchlike reaction-motors, the ex- 
act principles of which died, as 
far as we were concerned, with 
the crash.

The craft was mainly of alumi- 
num, magnesium and a kind of 
stainless steel, proving that, con- 
fronted with problems similar to 
ones we had encountered, aliens 
might solve them in similar ways. 
From the crumpled -up wreckage 
which we dug out of that Missouri 
hillside, Klein even noticed a 
familiar method of making gird- 
ers and braces lighter. Circular 
holes were punched out of them 
at spaced intervals. 

I kept hunting conviction by 
telling myself that, for the first 
time in all remembered history, 
we were peeking behind the veil 
of another planet. This should be 
the beginning of a new era, one 
of immensely widened horizons, 
and of high romance — but with a 
dark side, too. The sky was no 
lbnger a limit. There were things 
beyond it that would have to be 
reckoned with. And how does un- 
known meet unknown? Suppose 
one has no hand to shake? 

The mass of that wreck reeked 
like a hot cinder- pile and a burn- 
ing garbage dump combined. It 
oozed blackened goo. There were 
crushed pieces of calcined mate- 
rial that looked like cuttlebone. 
The thin plates of charred stuff 
might almost have been pressed 
cardboard. Foot -long tubes of 
thin, tin -coated iron contained 
combined chemicals identifiable 
as proteins, carbohydrates and 
fats. Food, we decided. 



ATURALLY, we figured that 
here was a wonderful clue to 
the plant and animal life of an- 
other world. Take a can of or- 
dinary beef goulash; you can see 
the fibrous muscle and fat struc- 
ture of the meat, and the cellular 
components of the vegetables. 
And here it was true, too, to a 
lesser degree. There were thin 
flakes and small, segmented cylin- 
ders which must have been parts 
of plants. But most was a homo- 
geneous mush like gelatin. 

Evidently there had been three 
occupants of the craft. But the 
crash and the fire had almost 
destroyed their forms. Craig, our 
biologist, made careful slides of 
the remains, tagging this as horny 
epidermis, this as nerve or brain 
tissue, this as skeletal substance, 
and this as muscle from a tactile 
member — the original had been as 
thin as spaghetti, and dark- 
blooded. 

Under the microscope, muscle 
cells proved to be very long and 
thin. Nerve cells were large and 
extremely complex. Yet you could 
say that Nature, starting from 
scratch in another place, and 
working through other and per- 
haps more numerous millions of 
years, had arrived at somewhat 
the same results as it had 
achieved on Earth. 

I wonder how an other-world 
entity, ignorant of humans, would 
explain a shaving-kit pr a lipstick.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Probably for like reasons, much 
of the stuff mashed into that 
wreck had to remain incompre- 
hensible to us. Wrenches and 
screwdrivers, however, we could 
make sense of, even though the 
grips of those tools were not hand- 
grips. We saw screws and bolts, 
too. One device we found had 
been a simple crystal diaphragm 
with metal details — a radio. There 
were also queer rifles. Lord knows 
how many people have wondered 
what the extraterrestrial equiva- 
lents of common human devices 
would look like. Well, here were 
some answers. 

A few of the instruments even 
had dials with pointers. And the" 
numeral 1 used on them was a 
vertical bar, almost like our own. 
But zero was a plus sign. And 
they counted by twelves, not tens. 

But all these parallels with our 
own culture seemed canceled by 
the fact that, even when this ship 
was in its original undamaged 
state, no man could have gotten 
inside it. The difficulty was less a 
matter of human size than of 
shape and physical behavior. The 
craft seemed to have been circu- 
lar, with compartmentation in 
spiral form, like a. chambered 
nautilus. 

^TiHIS complete divergence from 
things we knew sent frost 
imps racing up and down my 
spine. 



And it prompted Blaine to say : 
“I suppose that emotions, drives, 
and purposes among off-Earth 
intelligences must be utterly in- 
conceivable to us." 

We were assembled in the big 
trailer that had been brought out 
for us to live in, while we made a 
preliminary survey of the wreck. 

“Only about halfway, Blaine," 
Miller answered. “Granting that 
the life-chemistry of those intelli- 
gences is the same as ours — the 
need for food creates the drive of 
hunger. Awareness of death is bal- 
anced by the urge to avoid it. 
There you have fear and com- 
bativeness. And is it so hard to 
tack on the drives of curiosity, 
invention, and ambition, especial- 
ly when you know that these be-, 
ings made a spaceship? Cast an 
intelligence in any outward form, 
anywhere, it ought to come out 
much the same. Still, there are 
bound to be wide differences of 
detail — with wide variations of 
viewpoint. They could be horrible 
to us. And most likely it’s mu- 
tual.” 

I felt that Miller was right. The 
duplication of a human race on 
other worlds by another chain of 
evolution was highly improbable. 
And to suppose that we might get 
along with other entities on a hu- 
man basis seemed pitifully naive. 

With all our scientific thor- 
oughness, when it came to ex- 
amining, photographing and re- 



STAMPED CAUTION 



133 



cording everything in the wreck, 
there was no better evidence of 
the clumsy way we were investi- 
gating unknown things than the 
fact that at first we neglected our 
supreme find almost entirely. 

It was a round lump of dried 
red mud, the sire of a soft base- 
ball. When Craig finally did get 
around to X-raying it, indications 
of a less dense interior and feath- 
ery markings suggesting a soft 
bone structure showed up on the 
plate. Not entirely sure that it 
was the right thing to do, he 
opened the shell carefully. 

Think of an artichoke . but 
not a vegetable. Dusky pink, 
with thin, translucent mouth-flaps 
moving feebly. The blood in the 
tiny arteries was very red — rich in 
hemoglobin, for a rare atmos- 
phere. 

As a youngster, I had once 
opened a chicken egg, when it was 
ten days short of hatching. The 
memory came back now. 

“It looks like a growing em- 
bryo of some kind,” Klein stated. 

“Close the lump again, Craig,” 
Miller ordered softly. 

The biologist obeyed. 

“A highly intelligent race of be- 
ings wouldn’t encase their devel- 
oping young in mud, would 
they?” Klein almost whispered. 

“You’re judging by a human 
esthetic standard,” Craig offered. 
“Actually, mud can be as sterile 
as the cleanest surgical gauze.” 



discussion was developing 
unspoken and shadowy rami- 
fications. The thing in the dusty 
red lump — whether the young of 
a dominant species, or merely a 
lower animal — had been born, 
hatched, started in life probably 
during the weeks or months of 
a vast space journey. Nobody 
would know anything about its 
true nature until; and if, it mani- 
fested itself. And we had no idea 
of what that manifestation might 
be. The creature might emerge 
an infant or an adult. Friendly 
or malevolent. Or even deadly. 

Blaine shrugged. Something 
scared and half-savage showed in 
his face. “What’ll we do with the 
thing?” he asked. “Keep it safe 
and see what happens. Yet it 
might be best to get rid of it fast 
— with chloroform, cyanide or the 
back of a shovel.” 

Miller’s smile was very gentle. 
“Could be you’re right. Blaine.” 
I’d never known Miller to pull 
rank on any of the bunch. Only 
deliberate thought would remind 
us that he was a colonel. But he 
wasn’t really a military man; he 
was a scientist whom the Army 
had called in to keep a finger on 
a possibility that they had long 
known might be realized. Yes — 
space travel. And Miller was the 
right guy for the job. He had the 
dream even in the wrinkles 
around his deep-set gray eyes. 
Blaine wasn’t the right guy. He 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was a fine technician, good at 
machinery, radar — anything of 
the sort. And a nice fellow. Maybe 
he’d just blown off steam — uncer- 
tainty, tension. I knew that no 
paper relating to him would be 
marked, “Psychologically unsuit- 
ed for task in hand.” But I knew 
just as surely that he would be 
quietly transferred. In a big thing 
like this, Miller would surround 
himself only with men who saw 
things his way. 

That night we moved every- 
thing to our labs on the outskirts 
of St. Louis. Every particle of 
that extraterrestrial wreck had 
been packed and crated with ut- 
most care. Klein and Craig went 
to work to build a special refuge 
for that mud lump and what was 
in it. They were top men. But 
I had got tied up with Miller 
more or less by chance, and I 
figured I’d be replaced by an ex- 
pert. I can say that I was a col- 
lege man, but that’s nothing. 

I guess you can’t give up par- 
ticipation in high romance with- 
out some regret. Yet I wasn’t too 
sorry. I liked things the way 
they’d always been. My beer. My 
Saturday night dates with Alice. 
On the job, the atmosphere was 
getting a bit too rich and futur- 
istic. 

T ATER that evening, Miller 
^ drew me aside. “You've 
handled carrier pigeons and 

STAMPED CAUTION 



you’ve trained dogs, Nolan,” he 
said. “You were good at both.” 
"Here I go, back to the farm- 
yard.” 

“In a way. But you expand 
your operations, Nolan. You spe- 
cialize as nurse for a piece of off- 
the -Earth animal life.” 

"Look, Miller,” I pointed out. 
"Ten thousand professors are a 
million times better qualified, and 
rarin’ to go.” 

“They’re liable to fhinic they’re 
well qualified, when no man could 
be — yet. That’s bad, Nolan. The 
one who does it has to be humble 
enough to be wary — ready for 
whatever might happen. I think a 
knack with animals might help. 
That’s the best I can do, Nolan.” 
“Thanks, Miller.” I felt proud 
— and a little like a damn fool. 

“I haven’t finished talking yet,” 
Miller said. "We know that real 
contact between our kind and the 
inhabitants of another world can’t 
be far off. Either they’ll send an- 
other ship or we’ll build one on 
Earth. I like the idea, Nolan, but 
it also scares the hell out of me. 
Men have had plenty of trouble 
with other ethnic groups of their 
own species, through prejudice, 
misunderstanding, honest suspi- 
cion. How will it be at the first 
critical meeting of two kinds of 
things that will look like hallu- 
cinations to each other? I suspect 
an awful and inevitable feeling of 
separateness that nothing can

bridge—except maybe an impulse 
to do murder. 

“It could be a real menace. But 
it doesn’t have to be. So we’ve 
got to find out what we’re up 
against, if we can. We’ve got to 
prepare and scheme. Otherwise, 
even if intentions on that other 
world are okay, there’s liable to 
be an incident at that first meet- 
ing that can spoil a contact across 
space for all time, and make in- 
terplanetary travel not the success 
it ought to be, but a constant 
danger. So do you see our main 
objective, Nolan?” 

I told Miller that I under- 
stood. 

That same night, Klein and 
Craig put the lump of mud in a 
small glass case from which two- 
thirds of the air had been ex- 
hausted. The remainder was kept 
dehydrated and chilled. It was 
guess work, backed up by evi- 
dence : The rusty red of that mud; 
the high hemoglobin content of 
the alien blood we had seen; the 
dead-air cells — -resistant to cold — 
in the shreds of rough skin that 
we had examined. And then there 
was the fair proximity of Mars 
and Earth in their orbits at the 
time. 

My job didn’t really begin till 
the following evening, when Craig 
and Klein had completed a much 
larger glass cage, to which my 
outlandish — or, rather, outworld- 
ish — ward was transferred. Miller 



provided me with a wire-braced, 
airtight costume and oxygen hel- 
met, the kind fliers use at extreme 
altitudes. Okay, call it a space - 
suit. He also gave me a small tear- 
gas pistol, an automatic, and a 
knife. 

All there was to pit such arma- 
ment against was a seemingly 
helpless lump of protoplasm, two 
inches in diameter. Still, here was 
an illustration of how cautiously 
you are prompted to treat so un- 
known a quantity. You are un- 
able to gauge its powers, or lack 
of them, for you have nothing on 
which to base a judgment. 

I became like a monk — my 
pressure armor was my robe; the 
chilly semi -vacuum inside that 
glass cage, my cell. Nights out 
with Alice were going to be far 
between. 

/\N the third evening, that lump 
^ of mud, resting in dried-out 
soil similar to itself, split along 
the line where Craig had original- 
ly cut it. Out onto the cage floor 
crept what the records designated 
as E.T.L. — Extra - Terrestrial - 
Life. It was finished with the mud 
shell that had enabled it to sur- 
vive a crash and fire. 

Craig, Klein, Miller and a lot 
of news reporters stared into the 
glass cage from outside. There 
was nothing for me to do just 
then except watch that tiny mon- 
ster, and try to read, in its every 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



clumsy, dragging movement, some 
fragmentary unveiling of many 
riddles. 

Although it might have shrunk 
a bit since I had last seen it, it 
looked more complete. The dusky 
pink of its wrinkled integument 
was darker. It had dozens of short 
tendrils, hardly thicker than 
horsehair, with which it pulled it- 
self along. It had lost some 
leaflike pieces of skin. Laterally, 
two eyes gleamed, clear and 
slit-pupiled. Its jaws, hinged 
on a horizontal plane, opened 
and closed between fleshy flaps. 
Through the thin plastic of my 
oxygen helmet, I heard a queru- 
lous “chip-chip-chip,” which re- 
minded me of the squeaking of an 
infant bat. 

The E.T.L. crept in a small 
looping course on the cage floor, 
back to one half of the mud shell 
that had encased it. It tried to 
mount this, perhaps to gain a 
vantage point for better observa- 
tion. But it fell and turned over. 
Its ventral surface was ceiling- 
ward; its tendrils writhed furi- 
ously as it tried to right itself. I 
thought of a horseshoe crab, 
stranded on its back and kicking 
helplessly. But this thing’s form 
and movement were even more 
alien. 

After a moment, I followed an 
impulse which was part duty to 
my job and part pity. I tipped the 
little horror back on its bottom, 



glad that there was a glove be- 
tween me and it. Then I did the 
same thing I would do with a pet 
puppy or kitten. I set a dish of 
food — chemically prepared to 
duplicate the contents of the' 
tubes we had found in the wreck 
— right down in front of the 
E.T.L. 

It fumbled at the stuff and, 
possibly because of a gravity two- 
and-a-half times as great as it 
was made for, it almost got itself 
stuck in the mess. But it freed 
itself. Its mouth-flaps began to 
make lapping movements as it 
sucked the nourishment. 

I felt prematurely relieved. 
This was no potentially dominant 
wizard in a strange body, I told 
myself. This was pure animal. 

Over my helmet radiophone — 
there was a mike outside the cage, 
so they could communicate with 
me when I was inside — I heard 
Miller say to the reporters : 

“The feeding instinct. They’ve 
got it, too. Now we know for 
sure „ . 

T THINK that the E.T.L. had 
colic from that first meal, 
though, like any half - smart 
puppy trainer, I tried not to let 
it eat too much. It writhed for 
a while, as if in pain. And I was 
on pins. How was I supposed to 
know just what was best to feed 
the thing, so it would survive? 
Everything was guesswork, vary- 



STAMPED CAUTION 



137 



ing formulas cautiously, grop- 
ing. And it wasn’t only the food. 
There was the searching for the 
temperature, the air-pressure and 
the degree of dryness at which 
the E.T.L. seemed most comfort- 
able. And there was also the fid- 
dling around with light-composi- 
tion and intensities, variable in 
the sun lamps, to find what 
seemed best. 

* We seemed to have figured 
things out right — or else the mon- 
ster was just rugged. It shed sev- 
eral skins, thrived and grew ac- 
tive. Its size increased steadily. 
And other things began to grow 
in that cage. Odd, hard-shelled, 
bluish - green weeds; lichenous 
patches, dry as dust; invisible, 
un-Earthly bacteria — all were 
harmless, possibly even beneficial, 
to my charge. 

How did all this stuff come into 
being? Miller and Craig had ex- 
amined the dried clay of the 
E.T.L/’s discarded casing with 
microscopes. They scraped dust 
from every fragment of the wreck 
that hadn’t been blasted too 
much with fire, and made cul- 
tures. They were looking for 
spores and seeds and microbes. 
And it wasn’t long before they 
had classified quite a list of other- 
world biological forms. The most 
common of these they trans- 
planted into the cage. 

Often I even slept inside the 
cage, clad in my armor. That’s 



devotion to a purpose for you. 
In a way, it was like living on a 
little piece of Mars. Often enough 
I was bored stiff. 

But plenty did happen. From 
the start Etl — we began calling 
the thing that — showed an al- 
most electrically intense curiosity 
for everything. Some of the habits 
of its kind were written in its in- 
stincts. It basked in strong light, 
but it liked dark comers, too. At 
night — when we turned the sun 
lamps off, that is — it would bury 
itself in the dusty soil. Protection 
against nocturnal cold might 
have been the reason for that 

W HEN he was a month and 
two days out of his clay 
shell, Etl tried to rear up vertical- 
ly on his tendrils. He kept top- 
pling over. Maybe he was trying 
to “walk.” But there were no 
bones in those tendrils and, of 
course, the strong Earth gravity 
defeated him. 

Lots of times I tried to see what 
he could do. A real scientist 
would call this “making tests.” 
I just called it fooling around. 
I made him climb a stool for his 
food. He seemed to make a care- 
ful survey first, eying each rung; 
then he drew himself up in one 
motion. 

During one of my rare nights in 
town — to get a refresher from out- 
landish stuff in Alice’s company 
— I bought some toys. When I 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



came back to relieve Craig, who 
had taken care of Etl during my 
absence, I said: “Etl, here's a 
rubber ball. Let’s play.” 

He caught it on the second try, 
in those swift, dextrous tendrils. 
There was a savagery in the way 
he did it. I thought of a dog 
snapping a bumblebee out of the 
air. Yet my idea that Etl was just 
an animal had almost vanished 
by then. 

I got into the habit of talking 
to him the way you do to a pup. 
Sort of crooning. “Good fella, Etl. 
Smart. You learn fast, don’t 
you?” 

Stuff like that. And I’d coax 
him to climb up the front of my ' 
spacesuit. There were fine, barb- 
like prongs along the length of 
his many tentacles; 1 could feel 
them pulling in the tough, rub- 
berized fabric, like the claws of 
a climbing kitten. And he would 
make a kind of contented chirp- 
ing that might have had affection 
in it. 

But then there was the time 
when he bit me. I don’t know the 
reason, unless it was that I had 
held onto his ball too long. He 
got my finger, through the glove, 
with his snaggy, chalk-hued man- 
dibles, while he made a thin hiss- 
ing noise. 

Pretty soon my hand swelled 
up to twice its size, and I felt 
sick. Klein had to relieve me in 
the cage for a while. The bite 



turned out to be mildly venom- 
ous. Before that, I’d had a rash 
on my arms. An allergy, prob- 
ably ; maybe some substance from 
those Martian plants had gotten 
inside my spacesuit and rubbed 
onto my skin. Who knows? Per- 
haps Earthly flesh can sense alien 
life, and reddens to fight it off. 
And there you have one of the 
potential disadvantages of con- 
tact with unknown worlds. 

HpHAT poisoned bite was one 
-*■ thing. But Etl’s show of rage 
was another — a sign of the mixed 
nature of all his kind, emerging 
a bit from the shadows of enigma. 
Here revealed was the emotion 
on which things like murder are 
based. These creatures had it, 
just as we did. Maybe it’s neces- 
sary for any kind of thing that 
can progress upward from noth- 
ing. Still, people did not find 
it reassuring when they heard 
about it on the newscast. 

After that, popular opinion in- 
sisted that the cage be constantly 
surrounded by four manned ma- 
chine-guns pointing inward. And 
tanks of cyanogen were so ar- 
ranged that the poison gas could 
be sent gushing into the cage at 
any time. 

Part of my mind felt these pre- 
cautions were completely exag- 
gerated. There is a certain, ever- 
present segment of any public, 
whose jittery imagination is a

constant fuse -cap for panic. Such 
cowardice angered me. 

But the rest of me went along 
with Miller when he said : "We’re 
in the dark, Nolan. For all we 
know, we might be up against 
very swift maturity and inherited 
memory. And we’ve got to go on 
testing Etl . with toys, psycho- 
logical apparatus and tools and 
devices made by his own people. 
Suppose he ‘remembers’ skills 
from his ancestors, and can build 
dangerous new devices, or make 
old ones work again? If his kind 
are bent on being enemies, we'd 
better find it out as soon as pos- 
sible, too, hadn't we? No, I don’t 
truly expect any serious develop- 
ments, Nolan. Still — just for in- 
surance — eh?” 

A YEAR passed without great 
mishap — unless I should 
mention that Alice and I got mar- 
ried. But it didn’t spoil anything, 
and it raised my morale. We got 
a bungalow right on the lab 
grounds. 

A lot had been accomplished, 
otherwise. Once I let Etl play 
with my gun, minus cartridges. 
He was avidly interested; but he 
paid no attention to the Hopalong 
cap pistol that I left in its place 
when I took the gun back. He 
figured out how to grip, simple 
Martian tools, threading his tac- 
tile members through the holes in 
their handles; but complicated 



devices of the same origin seemed 
more of a puzzle to him than to 
the rest of us. So our inherited- 
memory idea faded out. 

Etl liked to work with those 
slender tendrils of his. The dex- 
terity and speed with which he 
soon learned to build many things 
with a construction set seemed to 
prove a race background of per- 
haps ages of such activities. I 
made a tower or a bridge, while 
he watched. Then he was ready to 
try it on his own, using screw- 
drivers that Klein had made with 
special grips. 

Of course we tried dozens of 
intelligence tests on Etl, mostly 
of the puzzle variety, like fitting 
odd-shaped pieces of plastic to- 
gether to form a sphere or a cube. 
He was hard to rate on any com- 
mon human I.Q. scale. Even for 
an Earthian, an I.Q. rating is 
pretty much of a makeshift pro- 
position. There are too many 
scattered factors that can’t be 
touched. 

With Etl, it was even tougher. 
But at the end of that first year 
Miller had him pegged at about 
120, judging him on the same 
basis as a five-year-old child. 
This score scared people a lot, 
because it seemed to hint at a 
race of super-beings. 

But Miller wasn’t jumping to 
conclusions. He pointed out to 
the reporters that Etl's kind 
seemed to grow up very rapidly; 



140 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



120 was only twenty points above 
the norm — not uncommon among 
Earth youngsters, especially those 
from more gifted families. Etl 
seemed to have sprung from cor- 
responding parentage, he said, for 
it seemed clear that they had been 
of the kind that does big things. 
They’d made a pioneering voyage 
across space, hadn’t they? 

TT'TL could make chirps and 
squeaks and weird animal 
cries. Human speech, however, 
was beyond his vocal powers, 
though I knew that he could un- 
derstand simple orders. He had 
a large tympanic membrane or 
"ear” on his ventral surface. Of 
•course we wondered how his kind 
communicated with one another. 
The way he groped at my fingers 
with certain of his tentacles gave 
us a clue. There were tiny, nerve- 
like threads at their extremities. 
Seeing them prompted Miller to 
do something as brave as it was 
foolhardy. 

He called in a surgeon and had 
a nerve in his arm bared. It must 
have hurt like the devil, but he 
let Etl clutch it with those thread- 
like members. 

I was cockeyed enough to fol- 
low Miller’s example and found 
out how much it really hurt. The 
idea was to establish a nerve 
channel, brain to brain, along 
which thoughts might pass. But 
nothing came through except a 



vague and restless questioning, 
mixed with the pain of our experi- 
ment. 

"It doesn’t work with us p 
Nolan,” Miller said regretfully. 
•“Our nervous systems aren’t 
hooked up right for this sort of 
stunt, or Etl’s nerve cells are too 
different from ours.” 

So we had to fall back on 
simpler methods of communica- 
tion with Etl. We tried teaching 
him sign language, but it didn’t 
work too well, because tentacles 
aren’t hands. Klein’s inventive 
ability, plus some pointers from 
me about how Etl used his ten- 
drils, finally solved the problem. 

Klein made a cylindrical ap- 
paratus with a tonal buzzer, op- 
erated by electricity, at one end. 
It had dozens of stops and con- 
trols, their grips in the shape of 
tiny metal rings, along the sides 
of the cylinder. 

First I had to learn a little 
about how to work that instru- 
ment with my big fingers. The 
trick was to mold the sounds of 
the buzzer, as human lips and 
tongue mold and shape tones of 
the vocal cords, so that they be- 
came syllables and words. 

"Hell-oh-g-g-Et-t-l-l . Chee- 
s-s-ee-whad-d I-ee got-t?” 

It was tougher for me than 
learning to play a saxophone is 
for a boy of ten. And the noises 
were almost as bad. 

I turned the apparatus over to 



STAMPED CAUTION 



Ml 



Etl as soon as I could. Let him 
figure out how to use it. I’d just 
give him the words, the ideas. Of 
course he had to get educated, 
learn his cat, dog and rat, and his 
arithmetic, the same as a humah 
kid, even if he was from another 
world. In a way, it was the law. 
You can’t let a youngster, cap- 
able of learning, stay home from 
school. 

And I was Etl’s tutor. I thought 
what a crazy situation we had 
here; an entity from one planet 
being brought up on another, 
without any real knowledge of 
his own folks, and unable to be 
very close to those entities by 
whom he was being reared. It was 
strange and sad and a little 
comic. 

For a while I thought I had a 
stammering parrot on my hands : 
“Hel-l-l-l-o . Hell-oh-g-o . 
N-n-ol-l-an-n-n . Hell-lo-oh.” 

Etl never lost that habit of 
repetition. But he made progress 
in his studies. 

“One, two, free, fo’, fibe, siss 
. One time one ee one. toot time 
one ee two . 

Picture it the way it was — I, 
clad in a spacesuit, crouching be- 
side Etl in the cold, thin air in- 
side that cage, tracing numbers 
and words in the dusty soil on the 
floor, while he read aloud with his 
voice tube or copied my words 
and figures with a sharp stick. 
Outside the transparent cage, the 



television cameras would be 
watching. And I would think that 
maybe in. a way Etl was like 
Tarzan, being raised by apes. 

TT'OUR more years went by. I 
had offspring of my own. 
Patty and Ron. Good-looking, 
lovable brats. But Etl was my 
job — and maybe a little more 
than that. 

At the end of two years, he 
stopped growing. He weighed 
fifty -two pounds and he was the 
ugliest-looking, elongated, gray- 
pink, leathery ovoid that you 
could imagine. But with his voice 
tube clutched in his tendrils, he 
could talk like a man. 

He could take the finest watch 
apart, repair and clean it in jig- 
time — and this was just one skill 
among scores. Toward the end of 
the four years, a Professor Jonas 
was coming in regularly and get- 
ting into a spacesuit to give him 
lessons in physics, chemistry, col- 
lege math, astronomy and biol- 
ogy. Etl was having his troubles 
with calculus. 

And Etl could at least ape the 
outward aspects of the thoughts 
and feelings of men. There were 
things he said to me that were 
characteristic, though they came 
out of apparent sullenness that, 
for all I knew, had seeds of mur- 
der in it: “You’re my pal, Nolan. 
Sort of my uncle. I won’t say my 
father; you wouldn’t like that.” 



142 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Nice, embarrassing sentiment, 
on the surface. Maybe it was just 
cool mimicry — a keen mind add- 
ing up human ways from obser- 
vation of me and my kids, and 
making up something that sound- 
ed the same, without being the 
same at all. Yet somehow I hoped 
that Etl was sincere. 

Almost from the building of the 
cage, of course* we’d kept photo- 
graphs and drawings of Mars in- 
side for Etl to see. 

Hundreds of times I had said 
to him things like: “It’s a ninety- 
nine and ninety-nine hundredths 
per cent probability that your 
race lives on that world, Etl. Be- 
fore the ship that brought you 
crashed on Earth, we weren’t at 
all sure that it was inhabited, and 
it’s still an awful mystery. I guess 
maybe you’ll want to go there. 
Maybe you’ll help us make con- 
tact and establish amicable rela- 
tions with the inhabitants — if 
there’s any way we can do that.’’ 

During those five years, no 
more ships came to Earth from 
space, as far as we knew. I 
guessed that the Martians under- 
stood how supremely hard it 
would be to make friendly con- 
tact between the peoples of two 
worlds that had always been 
separate. There was difference of 
form, and certainly difference of 
esthetic concepts. Of custom, 
nothing could be the . same. We 
didn’t have even an inkling of 



what the Martian civilization 
would be like. 

|"|NE thing happened during the 
” third year of Etl’s existence. 
And his presence on Earth was 
responsible. Enough serious in- 
terest in space travel was built Up 
to overcome the human inertia 
that had counteracted the long- 
standing knowledge that such 
things were possible. A hydro gen - 
fusion reaction motor was built 
into a rocket, which was then 
hurled to the moon. 

Miller went along, ostensibly to 
help establish the first Army ex- 
perimental station there, but 
mostly to acquire the practical 
experience for a far longer leap. 

In a way, I wished I could have 
gone, too: but, after all, the 
shadows in Etl’s background were 
far more intriguing than the dead 
and airless craters and plains of 
the lunar surface. 

Before Miller and the other 
moon - voyagers even returned, 
Detroit was busy forging, casting 
and machining the parts for a 
better, larger and much longer- 
range rocket, to be assembled in 
White Sands, New Mexico. 

When Miller got back, he was 
too eager and busy to say much 
about the moon. For the next 
two and a half years, he was 
mostly out in White Sands. 

But during the first of our now 
infrequent meetings, he said to 



STAMPED CAUTION

Craig and Klein and me: “When 
I go out to Mars, I’d like to keep 
my old bunch as crew. I need 
men I'm used to working with, 
those who understand the prob- 
lems we're up against. I have a 
plan that makes sense. The 
trouble is, to join this expedition, 
a man has to be part damn-fool." 

Klein chuckled. 'Til sell you 
some of mine.” 

I just nodded my way in. I’d 
never thought of backing out. 

Craig grabbed Miller’s hand 
and shook it. 

Miller gave Etl a chance to say 
no. “You can stay on Earth if 
you want to, Etl.” 

But the creature said: “I have 
lived all my life with the idea of 
going, Miller. Thank you.” 

M ILLER briefed us about his 
plan. Then he, Klein, Craig 
and I all took a lot of psych tests 
— trick questioning and so forth 
to reveal defects of conviction 
and control. But we were all 
pretty well indoctrinated and 
steady. Etl had taken so many 
tests already that, if there were 
any flaws still hidden in him, they 
would probably never be found. 

Mars and Earth were ap- 
proaching closer to each other 
again in their orbital positions. A 
month before takeoff time, Craig, 
Klein and I took Etl, in a small 
air-conditioned cage, to White 
Sands. The ship towered there, 



silvery, already completed. We 
knew its structure and the func- 
tion of its machinery intimately 
from study of its blueprints. But 
our acquaintance with it had to 
be actual, too. So we went over it 
again and again, under Miller’s 
tutelage. 

Miller wrote a last message, 
to be handed to the newscast boys 
after our departure : 

“//, by Martian action, we fail 
to return, don’t blame the Mar- 
tians too quickly, because there is 
a difference and a doubt. Contact 
between worlds is worth more 
than the po/son of a grudge ...” 

I said good-by to Alice and the 
kids, who had come out to see 
me off. I felt pretty punk. Maybe 
I was a stinker, going off like that. 
But, on the other hand, that 
wasn’t entirely the right way to 
look at things, because Patty’s 
and Ron’s faces fairly glowed 
with pride for their pa. The 
tough part, then, was for Alice, 
who knew what it was all about. 
Yet she looked proud, too. And 
she didn’t go damp. 

“If it weren’t for the kids, I’d 
be trying to go along, Louie,” she 
told me. “Take care of yourself.” 

She knew that a guy has to do 
what’s in his heart. I think that 
the basic and initial motive of 
exploration is that richest of hu- 
man commodities — high romance.

mercial stuff that get involved

later are only cheap by-products. 
To make the dream of space 
travel a reality was one of our 
purposes. But to try to forestall 
the danger behind it was at least 
as important. \ 

E blasted off in a rush of fire 
that must have knocked 
down some self -operating tele- 
vision cameras. We endured the 
strangling thrust of acceleration, 
and then the weightlessness of 
just coasting on our built-up 
velocity. We saw the stars and the 
black sky of space. We saw the 
Earth dwindle away behind us. 

But the journey .itself, though 
it lasted ninety days, was no real 
adventure — comparatively speak- 
ing. There was nothing unpredict- 
able in it. Space conditions were 
known. We even knew about the 
tension of nostalgia. But we un- 
derstood, too, the mental atti- 
tudes that could lessen the strain. 
Crossing space to another world 
under the tremendous power of 
atomic fusion, and under the pre- 
cise guidance of mathematics and 
piloting devices, reduces the proc- 
ess almost to a formula. If things 
go right, you get where you’re 
going; if not, there isn’t much you 
can do. Anyway, we had the feel- 
ing that the technical side of in- 
terplanetary travel was the sim- 
plest part. 

There is a marking near the 
Martian equator shaped like the 



funnel of a gigantic tornado. It is 
the red planet’s most conspicuous 
feature and it includes probably 
the least arid territory of a cold, 
arid world. Syrtis Major, it is 
called. Astronomers had always 
supposed it to be an ancient sea- 
bottom. That was where our pilot- 
ing devices were set to take us. 

Over it, our retarding fore -jets 
blazed for the last time. Our re- 
tractable wings slid from their 
sockets and took hold of the thin 
atmosphere with a thump and a 
soft rustle. On great rubber -tired 
wheels, our ship — horizontal now, 
like a plane — landed in a broad 
valley that must have been 
cleared of boulders by Martian 
engineers countless ages before. 

Our craft stopped rumbling. 
We peered from the windows of 
our cabin, saw the deep blue of 
the sky and the smaller but bril- 
liant Sun. We saw little dusty 
whirlwinds, carven monoliths 
that were weathering away, 
strange blue - green vegetation, 
some of which we could recognize. 
To the east, a metal tower glinted. 
And a mile beyond it there was 
a tremendous flat structure. An 
expanse of glassy roof shone. 
What might have been a highway 
curved like a white ribbon into 
the distance. 

The scene was quiet, beautiful 
and sad. You could feel that here 
maybe a hundred civilizations 
had risen, and had sunk back into

the dust. Mars was no older than 
the Earth; but it was smaller, 
had cooled faster and must have 
borne life sooner. Perhaps some 
of those earlier cultures had 
achieved space travel. But, if so, 
it had been forgotten until recent 
years. Very soon now its result 
would be tested. The meeting of 
alien entity with alien entity was 
at hand. 

I looked at Etl, still in his air- 
conditioned cage. His stalked eyes 
had a glow and they swayed nerv- 
ously, Here was the home-planet 
that he had never seen. Was he 
eager or frightened, or both? 

His education and experience 
were Earthly. He knew no more 
of Mars than we did. Yet, now 
that he was here and probably at 
home, did difference of physical 
structure and emotion make him 
feel that the rest of us were ene- 
mies, forever too different for 
friendly contact? My hide began 
to pucker. 

TTIGH in the sky, some kind of 
aircraft glistened. On the dis- 
tant turnpike there were the shin- 
ing specks of vehicles that van- 
ished from sight behind a ridge 
shaggy with vegetation. 

Miller had a tight, nervous 
-smile. “Remember, men,” he said. 
“Passivity. Three men can’t af- 
ford to get into a fight with a 
whole planet.” 

We put on spacesuits, which 



we’d need if someone damaged 
our rocket. It had been known 
for years that Martian air was too 
thin and far too poor in oxygen 
for human lungs. Even Etl, in his 
cage, had an oxygen mask that 
Klein had made for him. We had 
provided him with this because 
the Martian atmosphere, drifting 
away through the ages, might be 
even leaner than the mixture we’d 
given Etl on Earth. That had 
been based on spectroscopic anal- 
yses at 40 to 60 million miles’ dis- 
tance, which isn’t close enough 
for any certainty. 

Now all we could do was wait 
and see what would happen. I 
know that some jerks, trying to 
make contact with the inhabitants 
of an unknown world, would just 
barge in and take over. Maybe 
they’d wave a few times and grin. 
If instead of being met like broth- 
ers, they were shot at, they’d be 
inclined to start shooting. If they 
got out alive, their hatred would 
be everlasting. We had more 
sense. 

Yet passivity was a word that 
I didn’t entirely like. It sounded 
spineless. The art of balancing 
naive trust exactly against hard 
cynicism, to try to produce some- 
thing that makes a little sense, 
isn’t always easy. Though we 
knew something of Martians, we 
didn’t know nearly enough. Our 
plan might be wrong; we might 
turn out to be dead idiots in a 



146 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



short time. Still, it was the best 
thing that we could think of. 

The afternoon wore on. With 
the dropping temperature, a cold 
pearly haze began to form around 
the horizon. The landscape 
around us was too quiet. And 
there was plenty of vegetation at 
hand to provide cover. Maybe it 
had been a mistake to land here. 
But we couldn’t see that an arid 
place would be any good either. 
We had needed to come to a re- 
gion that was probably inhabited. 

We saw a Martian only once — 
scampering across an open glade, 
holding himself high on his stiff- 
ened tentacles. Here, where the 
gravity was only thirty -eight per- 
cent of the terrestrial, that was 
possible. It lessened the eeriness 
a lot to know beforehand what 
a Martian looked like. He looked 
like Etl. 

T ATER, something pinged sav- 
" agely against the flank of our 
rocket. So there were trigger- 
happy individuals here, too. But 
I remembered how, on Earth, 
Etl’s cage had been surrounded 
by machine-guns and cyanogen 
tanks, rigged to kill him quickly 
if it became necessary. That 
hadn’t been malice, only sensible 
precaution against the unpredict- 
able. And wasn’t our being sur- 
rounded by weapons here only 
the same thing, from another 
viewpoint? Yet it didn’t feel 



pleasant, sensible or not. 

There were no more shots for 
half an hour. But our tension 
mounted with the waiting. 

Finally Klein said through his 
helmet phone: “Maybe Etl ought 
to go out and scout around now.” 

Etl was naturally the only one 
of us who had much chance for 
success. 

“Go only if you really want to, 
Etl,” Miller said, “It could be 
dangerous even for you.” 

But Etl had already put on his 
oxygen mask. Air hissed into his 
cage from the greater pressure 
outside as he turned a valve. 
Then he unlatched the cage -door. 
He wouldn’t be harmed by the 
brief exposure to atmosphere of 
Earth -density while he moved to 
our rocket’s airlock. Now he was 
getting around high on his ten- 
drils. Like a true Martian. 

He left his specially built pistol 
behind, according to plan. We 
had weapons, but we didn’t mean 
to use them unless everything 
went dead wrong. 

Etl’s tendrils touched the dusty 
surface of Mars. A minute later, 
he disappeared behind some scrub 
growths. Then, for ten minutes, 
the pendant silence was heavy. It 
was broken by the sound of a 
shot, coming back to us thinly 
through the rarefied air. 

“Maybe they got him,” Craig, 
said anxiously. 

Nobody answered. I thought 



STAMPED CAUTION 



147 



of an old story I’d read about 
a boy being brought up by wolves. 
His ways were so like an animal’s 
that hunters had shot him. He 
had come back to civilization 
dead. Perhaps there was no other 
way. 

By sundown, Etl had not re- 
turned. So three things seemed 
possible: He had been murdered. 
He had been captured. Or else he 
had deserted to his own kind. I 
began to wonder. What if we were 
complete fools? What if there 
were more than differences of 
body and background, plus the 
dread of newness, between Earth- 
men and Martians, preventing 
their friendship? 

What if Martians were basic- 
ally malevolent? 

But speculation was useless 
now. We were committed to a line 
of action. We had to follow it 
through. 

We ate a meager supper. The 
brief dusk changed to a night 
blazing with frigid stars. But the 
darkness on the ground remained 
until the jagged lump of light that 
was Phobos, the nearer moon; 
arose out of the west. Then we 
saw two shapes rushing toward 
our ship to find cover closer to it. 
As they hid themselves behind a 
clump of cactiform shrubs, I had 
only the memory of how I had 
seen them for a moment, their 
odd masks and accoutrements 
glinting, their supporting ten- 



drils looking like tattered rags 
come alive in the dim moonlight. 

W E’D turned the light out in 
our cabin, so we couldn’t be 
seen through the windows. But 
now we heard soft, scraping 
sounds against the outer skin of 
our rocket. Probably- they meant 
that the Martians were trying to 
get in. I began to sweat all over, 
because 1 knew what Miller 
meant to do. Here was a situa- 
tion that we had visualized be- 
forehand. 

“We could shut them out till 
dawn. Miller,” I whispered 
hoarsely. “We’d all feel better if 
the meeting took place in day- 
light. And there’d be less chance 
of things going wrong.” 

But Miller said, “We can’t tell 
what they’d be doing in the dark 
meanwhile, Nolan. Maybe fixing 
to blow us up. So we’d better get 
this thing over with now.” 

I knew he was right. Active re- 
sistance to the Martians could 
never save us, if they intended 
to destroy us. We might have 
taken the rocket off the ground 
like a plane, seeking safety in 
the upper air for a while, if we 
could get it launched that way 
from the rough terrain. But using 
our jets might kill some of the 
Martians just outside. They could 
interpret it as a hostile act. 

We didn’t matter much, except 
to ourselves. And our primary

objective was to make friendly 
contact with the beings of this 
planet, without friction, if it 
could be done. If we failed, space 
travel might become a genuine 
menace to Earth. 

At Miller’s order, Craig turned 
on our cabin lights. Miller pressed 
the controls of our ship's air- 
lock. While its outer valve re- 
mained wide, the inner valve un- 
sealed itself and swung slowly to- 
ward us. Our air whooshed out. 

The opening of that inner valve 
meant we were letting horror in. 
We kept out of line of possible 
fire through the open door. 

Our idea was to control our in- 
stinctive reactions to strangeness, 
to remain passive, giving the 
Martians a chance to get over 
their own probable terror of us by 
finding out that we meant no 
harm. Otherwise we might be 
murdering each other. 

The long wait was agony. In 
spite of the dehumidifying unit of 
my spacesuit, I could feel the 
sweat from my body collecting 
in puddles in the bottoms of my 
boots. A dozen times there were 
soft rustles and scrapes at the air- 
lock; then sounds of hurried re- 
treat. 

But at last a mass of gray-pink 
tendrils intruded over the thresh- 
old. And we saw the stalked eyes, 
faintly luminous in the shadowy 
interior of the lock. Grotesquely 
up-ended on its tentacles, the 



monster seemed to flow into the 
cabin. Over its mouth -palps was 
the cup of what must have been 
its oxygen mask. 

What was clearly the muzzle of 
some kind of pistol, smoothly 
machined, was held ready by a 
mass of tendrils that suggested 
Gorgon hair. Behind the first 
monster was a second, similarly 
armed. Behind him was a third. 
After that I lost count, as the 
horde, impelled by fear to grab 
control in one savage rush, spilled 
into the cabin with a dry -leaf 
rustle. 

A LL my instincts urged me to 
yank my automatic out of 
my belt and let go at that flood 
of horror. Yes, that was in me, 
although l*d been in intimate as- 
sociation with Etl for four years. 
Psychologists say that no will 
power could keep a man’s reflexes 
from withdrawing his hand from 
a hot stove for very long. And go- 
ing for my gun seemed almost a 
reflex action. 

There was plenty of sound logic 
to back up the urge to shoot. In 
the presence of the unfathomable, 
how could you replace the tried 
defenses of instinct with intellect- 
ual ideas of good will? 

On the other hand, to shoot 
now would be suicide and ruin 
our hopes, besides. So maybe 
there’d have to be human sacri- 
fices to faith between the planets.

If we succeeded ia following the 
plan, our faith would be proven 
either right or wrong. If we didn’t 
act passively, the failure would 
be partly our fault. In any case, 
if we didn’t get back to Earth, 
hatred and fear of the Martians 
would inevitably arise there, 
whether it had been the Martians’ 
fault or ours. The message that' 
Miller had left for newscast might 
only give people the self-righteous 
attitude that Earthly intentions 
had been good. If another expedi- 
tion ever came to Mars, it might 
shoot any inhabitants on sight, 
and maybe get wiped out itself. 

Still, how could we know that' 
the Martians weren’t preparing 
the kind of invasion of Earth that 
has been imagined so often? It 
was a corny notion, but the basis 
for it remained sound. Mars was 
a dying world. Couldn’t the Mar- 
tians still want a new planet to 
move to? 

All these old thoughts popped 
back into my head during that 
very bad moment. And if I was 
almost going for my pistol, how 
much worse was it for Craig, 
Klein and Miller, who hadn’t 
been as friendly with Etl as I had 
been? Maybe we should have put 
our weapons out of our own reach, 
in preparation for this incident. 
Then there would have been no 
danger of our using them. 

But any freedom of action was 
swiftly wrested from us. The 



Martians rolled over us in a wave. 
Thousands of dark tendrils with 
fine, sawlike spines latched onto 
our bodies. I was glad that I 
wore a spacesuit, as much from 
the revulsion I felt at a direct 
contact as for the small protec- 
tion it gave against injury. 

T AM sure that there was panic 
behind that wild Martian 
rush. To get US pinned down and 
helpless quickly, they drove 
themselves in spite of their own 
fear of the horrid human forms. 
For did I feel a tremor in those 
tendrils, a tendency to recoil from 
me? I was trembling and sweat- 
ing. Still, my impressions were 
vivid. Those monsters held us 
down as if they were Malay beat- 
ers holding down trapped py- 
thons. Maybe they had known 
beforehand what men looked like 
— from previous, secret expedi- 
tions to Earth. Just as we had 
known about Martians from Etl. 
But it wouldn’t have made any 
difference. 

Or perhaps they weren’t even 
aware that we were from the 
neighboring planet. But it would 
be obvious that we were from an- 
other world; nothing from their 
own planet could be so strange. 

Our own reactions to the situa- 
tion differed a little. Craig gasped 
curses through his helmet phones. 
Miller said, “Easy, men! Easy!" 
It was as if he were trying to 



STAMPED CAUTION 



151 



build up his own morale, too. I 
couldn’t utter a sound. 

It wasn’t hard for our captors 
to recognize our weapons. We 
were disarmed. They carried us 
out into the night and around a 
hill. We were piled onto a flat 
metallic surface. A vehicle under 
us began to throb and move; you 
could have called it a truck. The 
nature of its mechanism was 
hinted at only by a small, frosty 
wisp of steam or vapor up front. 
Perhaps it came from a leak. 
The Martians continued to hold 
us down as savagely as ever. Now 
and then a pair of them would, 
join the nerve -ends of tendrils, 
perhaps to converse. Others would 
chirp or hoot for no reason that 
I could understand. 

The highway rolled away be- 
hind us, under the light of Pho- 
bos. Buildings passed, vague as 
buildings along a road usually 
are at night. It was the same with 
the clumps of vegetation. Lights, 
which might have been electrical, 
flashed into my eyes and passed 
by. In a deep valley through 
which we moved in part of our 
short trip, a dense, stratified fog 
arose between the lights and me. 
I noticed with an odd detachment 
that the fog was composed of 
minute ice crystals, which glinted 
in the glow of the strange lamps. 
I tried to remember our course. 
I knew that it was generally east. 
Off in the night there were clang- 



ings and hisses that might have 
been factory noises. 

Once Miller asked, “Is every- 
body okay?” ' 

Klein’s and Craig’s responses 
were gruff and unsteady in the v 
phones. 

“Sure . 

- “More or less — if heart-failure 
doesn’t get me.” 

“I guess our skins are still in- 
tact,” I said. 

We didn’t talk after that. 

A T last we entered a long, 
downward - slanting tunnel, 
full of soft luminescence that 
seemed to come out of the white- 
tiled wails themselves. My atten- 
tion grew a little vague. It could 
be that my mind turned in on 
itself, like* a turtle drawing in its 
head for protection, In that state 
of semiconsciousness, I experi- 
enced a phantasm. I imagined I 
was a helpless grub being dragged 
down into the depths of an ant- 
hill. 

But such a grub belongs in an 
ant-hill a lot more than a man 
belonged where I was going. This 
became plainer when the large 
tunnel ended, and we were 
dragged and carried along wind- 
ing burrows, never more than 
three feet in diameter. Mostly 
they were tiled, but often their 
walls were of bare rock or soil. 
Twice we passed through air- 
locks. 



152 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I couldn’t describe too much of 
what I saw or the noises I heard 
in those warrens. In one place* in- 
candescence glowed and wheels 
turned. In a great low-ceilinged 
chamber full of artificial sun-rayy 
there was a garden with strange 
blooms. The architecture of the 
city was not altogether utilitarian 
and it was not unpleasing. I saw 
a lot more. But my mind was 
somewhat fuzzy, probably from 
shock and fatigue. 

I know we traversed another 
chamber, where trays full of 
round lumps of soil were set in 
frames. A Martian nursery, no 
doubt. 

Some minutes later, my com- 
panions and I were left in a small 
room, high enough so that we 
could stand erect in it. Here 
the Martians let go of us. We 
sprawled on the floor, faces down. 
We’d had a busy day. Our nerve- 
energy was burned out. 

Hopelessness warped all of my 
thoughts. I must have slipped 
into the coma of exhaustion. I 
had jangled dreams about Alice 
and the kids and home, and al- 
most imagined I was there. 

Half awake again, I had a curs- 
ing spree, calling myself fifty 
kinds of a numbskull. Be passive 
before the people of other worlds ! 
Reassure them! How did we ever 
think up that one? We’d been 
crazy. Why didn’t we at least use 
our guns when we’d had the 



chance? It wouldn’t have made 
any difference to be killed right 
away. 

Now we were sacrificial lambs 
on the altar of a featherbrained 
idea that the inhabitants of 
worlds that had always been sep- 
arate from the beginning should 
become friends, learn to swap and 
to benefit from the diverse phases 
of each other’s cultures. How 
could Martians who hatched out 
of lumps of mud be like humans 
at all? 

Klein, Craig, Miller and I were 
alone in that room. There were 
crystal -glazed spy- windows in the 
walls. Perhaps we were still being 
observed. 

VV7HILE I was sleeping, the 
** exit had been sealed with a 
circular piece of glassy stuff. Near 
the floor there were vents through 
which air was being forced into 
the room. Hidden pumps, which 
must have been hastily rigged for 
our reception, throbbed steadily. 

Miller, beside me, had removed 
his oxygen helmet. His grin was 
slightly warped as he said to me : 
“Well, Nolan, here’s another 
parallel with what we’ve known 
before. We had to keep Etl alive 
in a cage. Now the same thing is 
being done to us.” 

This could be regarded as a 
service, a favor. Yet I was more 
inclined to feel that I was like 
something locked up in a zoo. 



STAMPED CAUTION 



153 



Maybe Etl’s case was a little 
different. For the first thing he 
had known in life was his cage. 

I removed my oxygen helmet, 
too, mainly to conserve its air- 
purifier unit, which I hoped I 
might need sometime soon — in an 
escape. 

“Don’t look so glum, Nolan,” 
Miller told me. “Here we have 
just what we need, a chance to 
observe and learn and know the 
Martians better. And it’s the 
same for them in relation to us. 
It’s the best situation possible 
for both worlds.” 

I was thinking mostly — belat- 
edly — of my wife and kids. Right 
then, Miller was a crackpot to 
me, a monomaniac, a guy whose 
philosophical viewpoint went way 
beyond the healthy norm. And I 
soon found that Craig and Klein 
agreed with me now. Something 
in our attitude had shifted. 

I don’t know how long we were 
in that sealed room. A week, per- 
haps. We couldn’t see the day- 
light. Our watches had vanished 
along with our weapons. Some- 
times there were sounds of much 
movement in the tunnels around 
us; sometimes little. But the var- 
iation was too irregular to indi- 
cate a change based on night and 
day. 

Lots of things happened to us. 
The air we breathed had a chem- 
ical smell. And the Martians kept 
changing its composition and 



density constantly — experiment- 
ing, no doubt. Now it would be 
oppressively heavy and humid; 
now it would be so dry and thin 
that we began to feel faint. They 
also varied the temperature, from 
below freezing to Earthly desert 
heat. And I suspected that at 
times there was a drug in the air. 

Food was lowered to us in 
metal containers from a circular 
airlock in the ceiling. It was the 
same kind of gelatinous stuff that 
we had found in the wreck of the 
ship that had brought the infant 
Etl to Earth. We knew that it 
was nourishing. Its bland sweet- 
ishness was not to our teste, but 
we had to eat. 

Various apparatus was also 
lowered to us. There were odd 
mechanical puzzles that made me 
think how grotesquely Earthly 
Martian scientific attitudes were. 
And there was & little globe on a 
wire, the purpose of which we 
never figured out, though Miller 
got an electric shock from it. 

¥ kept looking for Etl among 
the Martians at the spy-win- 
dows, hoping that he'd turn up 
again. I had noticed that Mar- 
tians showed variations of ap- 
pearance, like humans — longer or 
shorter eye-stalks, lighter or dark- 
er tendrils ... I figured I’d recog- 
nize Etl. But I didn’t see him. 

We were none of us quite our- 
selves. Not even Miller, whose 



154 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



scientific interest in the things 
around him sustained him even 
in captivity. Mine had worn out. 
And Klein and Craig were no 
better off. I was desperately 
homesick, and I felt a little ill, 
besides. 

I managed to loosen the metal 
heel-plate from one of my boots, 
and with this, when I thought 
that no Martian was watching, I 
started to dig the gummy cement 
from around the circular glassy 
disc with which the main exit of 
our quarters had been sealed. 
Craig, Klein and I worked at it 
in brief and sporadic shifts. We 
didn’t really hope that we could 
escape. It was just something -to 
do. 

“We’re going to try to get to 
the ship. Miller, if it’s still there,” 
I whispered once. “Probably it 
won’t work. Want to join up with 
the rest of us?” 

I just didn’t think of him as 
being in command now. And he 
seemed to agree, because he didn’t 
protest against my high-handed 
way of talking. Also, he didn’t 
argue against a projected rashness 
that could easily get us killed. 
Apparently he understood that 
our lives weren’t worth much to 
us as things were. 

He smiled a little. “I’ll stick 
around, Nolan. If you do manage 
to get back to Earth, don’t make 
the Martians sound too bad.” 

“I won't,” I answered, troubled 



by an odd sense of regret. 

Loosening that exit disc proved 
in the end to be no special trick. 
Then we just waited for a lull in 
the activity in the tunnels around 
us. We all put on our oxygen 
helmets. Miller included, for the 
air-pressure here in our “cage” 
would drop as soon as the loos- 
ened disc was dislodged. We put 
our shoulders against it and 
pushed. It popped outward. Then 
the three of us, with Miller stay- 
ing behind, scrambled on hands 
and knees through the tunnel that 
lay before us. 

A crazy kind of luck seemed to 
be with us. For one thing, we 
didn’t have to retrace our way 
along the complicated route by 
which we had been brought down 
to our prison. In a minute we 
reached a wide tunnel that slant- 
ed upward. A glassy rotary air- 
lock worked by a simple lever— 
for, of course, most of the city’s 
air would be pressurized to some 
extent for the Martians — led into 
it. 

The main passage wasn’t ex- 
actly deserted, but we traversed 
it in leaps and bounds, taking 
advantage of the weak Martian 
gravity. Shapes scattered before 
us, chirping and squeaking. 

We reached the surface quickly. 
It was frigid night. We stumbled 
away into it, taking cover under 
some lichenous bushes, while we

155 



looked for the highway. It was 
there, plain to see, in the light of 
Phobos. We dashed on toward it, 
across what seemed to be a plant- 
ed field. A white layer of ice- 
crystal mist flowed between and 
over those tough cold -endured 
growths. For a minute, 'just as 
two shots rang out behind us, we 
were concealed by it completely. 

I thought to myself that, to the 
Martians, we were like escaped 
tigers or leopards — only worse. 
For a moment I felt that we had 
jumped from the frying pan into 
the fire. But, as we reached the 
highway, my spirits began to soar. 
Perhaps — only perhaps — I’d see 
my family again before too long. 
There was traffic on the road, 
trains of great soft- tired wagons, 
pulled by powered vehicles ahead. 
I wondered if, like on Earth, 
much freight was moved at night 
to avoid congestion. 




GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



‘‘When I was a college kid, I 
used to hitch-hike sometimes,” 
Craig remarked. 

‘‘I don't guess we had better try 
that here,” Klein said. “What we 
can do is more of a hobo stunt.” 
We found the westerly direc- 
tion we needed easily enough 
from the stars. The constellations 
naturally looked the same as they 
did at home. We hid behind some 
rustling leaves, dry as paper, and 
waited for the next truck train to 
pass. When one came, we used the 
agility which Martian gravity 
gave us and rushed for the tail- 
end wagon and scrambled aboard. 
There we hid ourselves under a 
kind of coarse -fibered tarpaulin. 

Peering past boxes and bales, 
we kept cautious watch of the 
road. We saw strange placques, 
which might have served as high- 
way signs. Again we saw build- 
ings and passing lights. 

We were dopes, of course, ever 
to think that we were going to get 
away with this. Our overwrought 
nerves had urged us to unreason- 
ing rebellion, and we had yielded 
to them. 

O UR last hope was punctured 
when at last we saw the flood- 
lights that bathed our ship. The 
taste on my tongue was suddenly 
bitter. There were roughly three 
things we could do now, and none 
of the choices was especially at- 
tractive. 



We could go back where we 
had come from. We could try to 
keep concealed in the countryside, 
until we were finally hunted 
down, or until our helmet air- 
purifiers wore out and we smoth- 
ered. Or we could proceed to our 
rocket, which was now surround- 
ed by a horde of Martians. 
Whichever one we chose, it look- 
ed as if the end would be the same 
— death. 

“I’m for going on to the ship,' 
Klein said in a harsh whisper. 

“The same with me,” Craig 
agreed. “It’s where we want to 
go. If they’re going to kill or 
capture us, it might as well be 
there.” 

Suddenly, for no good reason, 
I thought of something. No spe- 
cial safeguards had been set up 
around that sealed room in the 
city. 

Escape had been easy. What 
did that mean? 

“Okay,” I said. “Maybe you’ve 
both got the same hunch I just 
got. We walk very slowly toward 
our rocket. We get into the light 
as soon as possible. Does that 
sound right to you? We’d be go- 
ing back to the plan. And, it 
could be, to common sense.” 

“All right,” Klein answered. 

“We’ll give it a whirl,” Craig 
agreed. 

We jumped off that freight 
wagon at the proper moment and 
moved toward the rocket. Noth-

ing that we’d done on Mars — not 
even making out first acquaint- 
ance with the inhabitants — was 
as ticklish an act. 

S TEP after slow step, we ap- 
proached the floodlighted area, 
keeping close together before that 
horde which still looked horrible 
to us. One thing in our favor was 
that the Martians here had prob- 
ably been warned of our escape 
by whatever means of communi- 
cation they used. And they could 
certainly, guess that our first ob- 
jective would be our ship. Hence 
they would not be startled into 
violence by our sudden appear- 
ance. 

One of them fired a shot which 
passed over our heads. But we 
kept on going, making our move- 
ments as unfrightening as we 
could to counteract the dread of 
us that they must have still felt. 

Panic and the instinctive fear 
of the strange were balanced in 
our minds against reason. We got 
to the nose of our ship, then to 
the open doors of its airlock. The 
horde kept moving back before 
us and we clambered inside. Mar- 
tian eyes remained wary, but no 
more action was taken against us. 

Our cabin had been ransacked. 
Most of the loose stuff had been 
removed . even my picture of 
Alice, and our two kids. 

“Who cares about trifles?” 1 
muttered. “Rap on wood, guys — 



I think we’ve won. So have the 
local people.” 

“You’re right,” Klein breathed. 
“What other reason can there be 
for their not jumping us? Miller’s 
passive strategy must’ve worked 
the first time. The story that we 
meant no harm must have gotten 
around. They don’t want to make 
trouble, either. And who, with 
any sense does?” 

I felt good — maybe too good. 
I wondered if the Martians felt 
the same eager fascinatioh for 
the enigmas of space that we felt, 
in spite of the same fear of the 
nameless that we too could feel. 
My guess was that they did. Un- 
doubtedly they also wanted inter- 
planetary relations to be smooth. 
They could control their instinc- 
tive doubts to help attain this 
objective. If they coveted Earth’s 
resources, it was still far away, 
and could defend itself. Besides, 
they were not built to live in 
comfort under the raw conditions 
of its strange environment. Com- 
merce was the only answer. 

Suddenly Mars was no longer 
a hostile region to me, out in the 
reaches of space. Again it was 
full of endless, intriguing myster- 
ies. It was beautiful. And knowl- 
edge of that beauty and mystery 
had been won, in spite of some 
blundering. The scheme that we 
had practiced, and that Miller 
had stuck to, had paid off. It had 
broken down that first inevitable 



158 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



barrier of alienness between 
Earthmen and Martians enough 
so that they now had a chance to 
start looking for the countless 
similarities between us. 

A fraction of our food stores 
aboard the rocket had been taken, 
probably for analysis. But there 
was plenty more. We closed the 
airlock, repressurized the cabin 
from air-tanks, and cooked our- 
selves a meal. Then we slept in 
shifts, one of us always awake as 
guard. 

At dawn, Miller hammered at 
a window. He’d been brought out 
from the city. We weren’t too 
surprised by then. 

'C’TL turned up at noon. He 
came in a kind of plane, 
which landed right beside our 
rocket, making quite a noise. I 
recognized him easily enough; 
I’d know those eye -stalks any- 
where. Besides, as he came out of 
the plane, he was carrying the 
speech-tube that Klein had made 
for him. 

We let him into the cabin. 
“Hello, gang,” he said, manipu- 
lating the tube with his tendrils. 
“I see you passed your tests al- 
most as well as I did on those 
weird things you were always 
making me take on Earth.” 

“So they were tests,” I said. 

“Sure. Otherwise, why do you 
think I didn’t come to you be- 
fore? They said you had to solve 



your own problems.” 

“How did they treat you?” Mil- 
ler wanted to know. 

“Mostly my people were nice 
to me. They took me to a great 
desert city, far away. Sort of the 
capital of Mars, It’s in an ‘oasis’ 
where a network of ‘canals’ join. 
The canals fit an old theory of 
your astronomers. They’re rib- 
bons of irrigated vegetation. But 
the water is piped underground. 
I spoke to my people in the way 
that you once thought I would, 
trying to convince them that you 
were okay. But I guess that you 
did most of the job yourselves.” 
“In spite of a lot of blunders, 
maybe we did, Etl,” I replied 
dryly. “What are your plans? Go- 
ing to stay here now? Or will you 
come back with us?” 

I sensed that he would stay. It 
was natural. Maybe I even sensed 
a remoteness in him, a kind of 
withdrawal. Not unfriendly, but 
... we both knew it was the part- 
ing of the ways. 

“It’s best for what we’re trying 
to accomplish, Nolan,” he said. 
“I can tell my people about Earth; 
you can tell yours about Mars. 
Besides, I like it here. But I’ll be 
back on Earth some time. Just so 
you’ll come here again. Thanks 
to you guys for everything.” 

“I’d like to stay too, Nolan,” 
Miller said, smiling. “If they’ll 
have me. Under Etl’s instructions, 
they might improve my quarters.” 



STAMPED CAUTION

O that much was settled. I felt 
a certain longing myself now. 
But I’m a family man, with home 
still in my blood. Klein and Craig 
weren’t tied as I was, but they 
had a lot to hold them to Earth. 
Besides, somebody had to report 
back. 

We were on Mars two days 
longer, though we didn’t go any 
farther than back to the neigh- 
boring city. We took thousands 
of photographs, We were given 
samples of common Martian ap- 
paratus, pieces of jade that were 
covered with queer, beautiful 
carvings made millions of years 
before, bars of radioactive metal. 

Earth was still near enough in 
its orbit to be reached without 
too much trouble. We jacked our 
rocket into a vertical position, 
from which an interplanetary 



takeoff could best be made. The 
cabin, swinging on its universal 
joints, stayed level. Martians 
watched, interested, but still ob- 
viously not quite ready to cast 
aside their deeper suspicions. Yet, 
when we blasted clear, we knew 
that a ship of theirs, halfway 
around the planet, was doing the 
same and would follow us back 
to Earth. Ambassadors, of course, 
and commercial attaches. 

I’d lost my picture of Alice, 
Patty and Ron to some local sou- 
venir hunter. But I knew that I 
was going to see them . 

The friendly contact between 
Earth and Mars can still be 
queered by somebody’s silly 
blunder, of course. Human or 
Martian. You have to be careful. 
But a beginning has been made.

‘ARISTOCRAT OF SCIENCE FICTION 



★ 

. That's what Life Magazine calls GALAXY! 

It's true of the quality of GALAXY— in format, fiction, 
art, articles— but not its attitude. 

GALAXY is not edited for the nobility by the nobility 
of IQs, though your IQ can't help showing when you read 
the magazine. It's meant for everybody, male and fe- 
male, young and old, adult enough not to run to the 
dictionary whenever a word with more than two syllables 
is encountered, who wants to know what futures humanity 
may face, what the past may have been like, what may 
be found on other worlds . and how people will act 
under those circumstances. 

Could that be why GALAXY Science Fiction is growing 
more rapidly than any other science fiction magazine? 

Read it and you'll see for yourself! Only 35c a copy at 
your favorite newsstand ... or $3.50 a year. (Add $1 per 
year on foreign subscriptions to) Write to .
