nphe other day Hal Clement, 
Willy Ley and the under- 
signed took part in a closed-cir- 
cuit television panel discussion 
before seven thousand teachers 
in convention assembled in New 
York City. What the science 
teachers were interested in was 
finding ways to be more effec- 
tive in teaching their classes; 
what we were interested in was 
showing that science fiction can 
help in this. (Apparently it real- 
ly does. The more scientists we 
meet, the more we become con- 
vinced that early reading of sf 
is one of the greatest spurs to an 
interest in a scientific career.) 

In the course of the conversa- 
tion Hal Clement described What 
he calls The Game — the game, 
known to all science-fiction writ- 
ers and most sf readers, of mak- 
ing accurate deductions from an 
inaccurate statement. That’s 
what science fiction is all about. 
The author is entitled to One 
Big Lie. He can say, for example, 
that faster-than-light travel is 
possible; or that a time machine 



has been invented; or that men 
can read each other’s minds. 
What comes after that may not 
be a lie, however; it must follow 
naturally and inevitably from 
the first premise. 

It seems to us that it is not 
only science-fictionists who play 
The Game, but scientists as well. 
What else is the Scientific Meth- 
od but an application of The 
Game? Einstein invents a theory 
— call it relativity — and from 
that original invention certain 
consequences may be deduced. 
But he cannot call in a new 
theory to explain each of the 
consequences, any more than a 
science-fiction writer can pull 
another rabbit out of his hat to 
get his hero out of trouble when- 
ever he likes. 

Which leads us to the basic 
resemblance between science 
and science fiction. Both are de- 
fined not by their subject matter 
but by their method of handling 
it. Any subject is suitable for 
treatment by either . it’s all 
in the approach! — The Editor

FOR lO DAYS WITHOUT RISK 

SEE AND SHUDDER AT THE MOST SHOCKING SIGHTS 
IVEB HIDDEN FROM AN UNSUSPECTING PUBLIC! At last 
— a book that dares to pierce the “conspiracy of 
silence” and expose the terrifying, age-old rites of 
the Occult — as still practiced today! Astonishing 
1‘UMs-COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS (snapped at 
secret ceremonies with infra-red film) initiate you 
Into the fear-ridden realms of Voodoo and Devil- 
Worship . Witch and Warlock . Werewolf and 
Vampire. It is a world of grotesque cults 
und rituals, alchemy and sorcenr, spells 
nmi incantations. It is a world whose sin- 
ister, ever-growing power is working its 
diabolical will on millions — even in today's 
so-called “scientific age" — and may even 
now be influencing your future. 

Now THE SUPERNATURAL rips the veil 

secrecy from men and women who seem 
“just like you and me” by day — but walk 
with Satan by night. UNMASKED: the 
innocent young secretary, so shy she 
won’t even hold your hand. But at mid- 
night she will feverishly join the naked 
dance round the Phallic Pillar. UN- 
» 1 MASKED: the Voodoo Priest with hun- 
dreds of followers right in mid-Manhattan. He 
instincts his frenried cubists in the arcana of the 
JuJu Doll, Murder Spike,. and “Blood Bucket.” 



Only foots ora “too grown up" to fear the occult 

Nobody intelligent believes in weird supernatural 
talcs, we are told. Yet why does the Church — 
Catholic and Protestant — still regularly performs 
exorcisms to drive out demons and evil spirits? 
Why are mediums no longer being “scientifically 
exposed” in public — is it because the so-called 
“ghost breakers” found that some mediums defy 
scientific exposure ? Why arc leading universities, 
like Duke in North Carolina, quietly spending mil- 
lions of dollars for research into mind-reading, 
fortune telling, telekinesis and other aspects of 
ESP — ia it because they don’t believe? 

Guaranteed to Thrill You or Pay Nothing 
If you tried to duplicate the incredibly rich library 
of satanic lore that comprises THE SUPERNAT- 
URAL. you would have to visit 26 countries and 
Mill not be able to procure all the forbidden texts,

The 

Body Builders 

by KEITH LAUMER 

Illustrated by NOD EL 



Tired of being a 97-pound weakling? 
Just buy yourself the Body Beautiful! 



I 

TT e was a big bruiser in a Gen- 
A dye Mark Seven Sullivan, 
the luxury model with the nine- 
point sensory system, the highest- 
priced Grin-U-Matic facial ex- 
pression attachment on the mar- 
ket and genuine human hair, 
mustache and all. 



He came through the dining 
room entry like Genghis Kahn in- 
vading a Swiss convent. If 
there’d been a door in his way 
he’d have kicked it down. The 
two lads walking behind him — 
an old but tough-looking utility 
model of Liston and a fairly new 
Wayne — kept their hands in 
their pockets and flicked their 



6 



eyes over the room like buggy 
whips. The head waiter popped 
out with a stock of big purple 
menus, but the Sullivan went 
right past him, headed across to- 
ward my table like a field mar- 
shal leading a victory parade. 

Lorena was with me that night, 
looking classy in a flossed-up 
Dietrich that must have set her 
back a month’s salary. She was 
in her usual mood for the usual 
reason: she wanted to give up 
her job at Cent-Prog and sign 
a five-year marriage contract 
with me. The idea left me cold as 
an Eskimo’s tombstone. In the 
first place, at the rate she burn- 
ed creds, I’d have to creak 
around in a second-hand Lionel 
with about thirty per cent sen- 
sory coverage and an undersized 
power core; and in the second, I 
was still carrying the torch for 
Julie. Sure, Julie had nutty 
ideas about Servos. According 
to her, having a nice wardrobe 
of specialized outfits for all oc- 
casions was one step below can- 
nibalism. 

“You and that closet full of 
zombies!” she used to shake her 
finger under my nose. “How 
could a girl possibly marry you 
and never know what face she’d 
see when she woke up in the 
morning!” 

She was exaggerating, but that 
was the way those Organo-Re- 
publicans are. No logic in ’em. 



. After all, doesn’t it make sense 
to keep your organic body on 
file in the Municipal Vaults, safe 
out of the weather, and let a 
comfortable, late-model Servo do 
your walking and talking? Our 
grandparents found out it was 
a lot safer and easier to sit in 
front of the TV screen with feely 
and smelly attachments than to 
be out bumping heads with a 
crowd. It wasn’t long after that 
that they developed the contact 
screens to fit your eyeballs, and 
the plug-in audio, so you be- 
gan to get the real feel of audi- 
ence participation. Then, with 
the big improvements in minia- 
turization and the new tight- 
channel transmitters, you could 
have your own private man-on- 
the-street pickup. It could roam, 
seeing the sights, while you rack- 
ed out on the sofa. 

Of course, with folks spending 
so much time flat on their backs, 
the Public Health boys had to 
come up with gear to keep the 
organic body in shape. For a 
while, people made it with part- 
time exercise and home model 
massage and feeding racks, but 
it wasn’t long before they set 
up the Central File system. 

Heck, the government already 
had everything about you on 
file, from your birth certificate 
to your fingerprints. Why not 
go the whole hog and file the 
body too? 



THE BODY BUILDERS

/"\f course, nobody had expect- 
ed what would happen when 
the quality of the sensory pick- 
ups and playbacks got as good as 
they did. I mean the bit the egg- 
heads call “personality gestalt 
transfer”. But it figured. A guy 
always had the feeling that his 
consciousness was sitting some- 
where back of his eyes; so when 
the lids were linked by direct 
hookup to the Servo, and all the 
other senses tied in — all of a 
sudden, you were there. The 
brain was back in Files, doped 
to the hairline, but you — the 
thing you call a mind — was 
there, inside the Servo, living 
it up. 

And with that kind of identi- 
fication, the old type utilitarian 
models went out of style, fast. 
People wanted Servos that ex- 
pressed the real inner man — the 
guy you should have been. With 
everybody as big and tough as 
they wanted to be, depending on 
the down payment they could 
handle, nobody wanted to take 
any guff off anybody. In the 
old days, a fellow had to settle 
for a little fender-bending; now 
you could hang one on the other 
guy, direct. Law Cent had to 
set up a code to cover the prob- 
lem, and now when some bird 
insulted you or crowded you 
off the Fastwalk, you slugged it 
out with a Monitor watching. 

Julie claimed it was all a 

8 



bunch of nonsense ; that two 
Servos pounding each other 
didn’t prove anything. She could 
never see that with perfect link- 
age, you were the Servo. Like 
now: The waiter had just put a 
plate of Consomme au Beurre 
Blanc in front of me, and with 
my high-priced Yum-gum palate 
accessory, I’d get the same high 
class taste thrills as if the soup 
was being shoved down my Org’s 
mouth in person. It was a spe- 
cial mixture, naturally, that lub- 
ricated my main swivel and sup- 
plied some chemicals to my 
glandular analogs. But the flavor 
was there. 

And meanwhile, the old body 
was doing swell on a nutrient- 
drip into the femoral artery. So 
it’s a little artificial maybe — but 
what about the Orggies, riding 
around in custom-built cars that 
are nothing but substitute per- 
sonalities, wearing padded shoul- 
ders, contact lenses, hearing 
aides, false teeth, cosmetics, ele- 
vator shoes, rugs to cover their 
bald domes. If you’re going to 
wear false eyelashes, why not 
false eyes? Instead of a nose 
bob, why not bob the whole face? 
At least a fellow wearing a Servo 
is honest about it, which is more 
than you can say for an Orggie 
doll in a foam-rubber bra — not 
that Julie needed any help in 
that department. 

I dipped my big silver spoon 

GALAXY 



A SPLIT SECOND IN ETERNITY 

The Ancients Called It COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS 

Must man die to release his inner 
consciousness? Can we experience 
momentary flights of the soul— 
chat is, become one with the uni- 
verse and receive an influx of great 
Understanding? 

The shackles of the body— its 
earthly limitations— can be thrown 
off and man’s mind can be attuned 
to the Infinite Wisdom for a flash 
©f a second. During this brief in- 
terval intuitive knowledge, great 
inspiration, and a new vision of 
our life’s mission are 
had. Some call this 
great experience a 
psychic phenomenon. 

But the ancients knew 
it and taught it as 
Cosmic Consciousness— 
the merging of man’s 
mind with the Uni- 
versal Intelligence. 

Let this 
Free Book Explain 

This is not a religious doctrine, but the application of simple, 
natural laws, which give man an insight into the great Cosmic 
plan. They make possible a source of great joy, strength, and a 
regeneration of man’s personal powers. Write to the Rosicru- 
cians, an age-old brotherhood of understanding, for a free copy 
of the book "The Mastery of Life.” It will tell you how, in the 
privacy of your own home, you may indulge in these mysteries of 
life known to the ancients. Address: Scribe U.A.H.

in and had the first sip just 
under my nose when the Sullivan 
slammed my arm with his hip 
going past. I got the soup square 
in the right eye. While I was 
still clicking the eyelid, trying 
to clear the lens, the Liston jar- 
red my shoulder hard enough to 
rattle my master solenoid. 

Normally, I’m a pretty even- 
tempered guy; it’s my theory 
that the way to keep a neurotron- 
ic system in shape is to hold the 
glandular inputs to a minimum. 
But, what with the big event 
coming up that night, and Lor- 
ena riding me hard on the joys 
of contract life, I’d had a hard 
day. I hopped up, overrode the 
eye-blink reflex, made a long 
reach and hooked a finger in 
the Liston’s collar going away. 

“Hold it right there, stumble- 
bum!” I gave the collar a flick 
to spin him around. 

T T e didn’t spin. Instead, my 
A A elbow joint made a noise like 
a roller skate hitting loose gravel; 
the jerk almost flipped me right 
on my face. 

The Liston did a slow turn, 
like a ten-ton crane rig, looked 
me over with a pair of yellow 
eyes that were as friendly as gun 
barrels. A low rumbling sound 
came out of him. I was a little 
shook but mad enough not to 
let it bother me. 

“Let’s have that license num- 



ber,” I barked at him. “There’ll 
be a bill for the eye and another 
one for a chassis checkup!” 

The Wayne had turned too, 
and was beetling his brows at 
me. The big shot Sullivan push- 
ed between the two of them, 
looked me over like I was some- 
thing he’d found curled up in a 
doorway. 

“Maybe you better kind of 
do a fade, Jasper,” he boomed 
loud enough for everybody in 
the restaurant to hear. “My boys 
got no sense of humor.” 

I had my mouth open for my 
next mistake when Lorena beat 
me to it: 

“Tell the big boob to get lost, 
Barney; he’s interrupting what I 
was saying to you.” 

The Sullivan rolled an eye at 
her, showing off his independent 
suspension. “Shut your yap, sis- 
ter,” he said. 

That did it. I slid my left foot 
forward, led with a straight left 
to the power pack, then uppercut 
him with everything I was able 
to muster. 

My right arm went dead to 
the shoulder. The Sullivan was 
still standing there, looking at 
me. I was staring down at my 
own fist, dangling at my side. 
Then it dawned on me what was 
wrong. 

For the moment, I’d forgotten 
I was wearing a light sport- 
model body.

GALAXY 




z" '' ully Fishbein, my business 
manager, Servo-therapist, 
drinking buddy, arena trainer 
and substitute old-maid aunt had 
warned me I might pull a stunt 
like tfiis some day. He was a 
Single-Servo Socialist himself, 
and in addition to his political 
convictions, he’d put a lot of time 
and effort into building me up 
as the fastest man with a net and ' 
mace in show business. He had 
an investment to protect. 

“I’m warning you, Barney,” he 
used to shove an untrimmed 
hangnail under my nose and yell. 
“One day you’re gonna get your 
reflexes crossed and miss your 



step on the Fastwalk — or gauge 
a close one like you was wearing 
your Astaire and bust the neck of 
that Camera you wasted all that 
jack on. And then where’ll you 
be, hah?” 

“So I lose a hulk,” I’d come 
back. “So what? I’ve got a closet 
full of spares.” 

“Yeah? And what if it’s a total? 
You ever heard what can happen 
to your mind when the connec- 
tion’s busted — and I do mean 
busted — like that?” 

“I wake up back in my Org 
body; so what?” 

“Maybe,” Gully would shake 
his head and look like a guy 
with dangerous secrets. “And 
maybe not . .” 



THE BODY BUILDERS

\X/hile I was thinking all this, 
* ’ the Sullivan was getting his 
money’s worth out of the Grin- 
U-Matic. He nodded and rocked 
back on his heels, taking his time 
with me. The talk had died out 
at the tables around us. Every- 
body was catching an ear full. 

“A wisey,” die Sullivan says, 
loud. “What’s the matter, 
Cheapie, tired of life outside a 
repair depot?” 

“What do you mean, ‘Cheap- 
ie’?” I said, just to give my 
Adam’s apple a workout. “This 
Arcaro cost me plenty . and 
this goon of yours has jarred my 
contacts out of line. Just spring 
for a checkup and I’ll agree to 
forget the whole thing.” 

“Yeah.” He was still showing 
me the expensive grin. “I’ll bet 
you will, pint-size.” He cocked 
an eye at the Wayne. “Now, let’s 
see, Nixie, under the traffic code, 
I got a couple courses of action, 
right?” 

“Cream duh pansy and let’s 
shake a ankle, Boss. I’m hungry.” 
Nixie folded a fist like a forty 
pound stake mallet and moved 
in to demonstrate his idea. 

“Nah.” The Sullivan stopped 
him with the back of his hand 
against his starched shirt-front. 
“The guy pops me first, right? 
He wants action. So I give him 
action. Booney.” He snapped his 
fingers and the Liston thumbed 
a shirt stud. 



“For the record,” the Sullivan 
said in a businesslike voice. “No- 
tice of Demand for Satisfaction, 
with provocation, under Section 
991-b, Granyauck 6-78.” I heard 
the whir and click as the recorder 
built into the Liston’s thorax 
took it down and transmitted it 
to Law Central. 

All of a sudden my mouth was 
dry. 

Sometimes those Servo design- 
ers got a little too realistic. I 
tapped a switch in my lower right 
premolar to cut out the panic- 
reaction circuit. I’d been all set 
for a clip on the jaw, an event 
that wouldn’t be too good for 
the Arcaro, but nothing a little 
claim to LawCent wouldn’t fix 
up. But now it was dawning like 
sunrise over Mandalay that Big 
Boy had eased me into a spot — 
or that I’d jumped into it, mouth 
first. I’d hit him. And the fact 
that he’d put my consomme in 
my eye first wouldn’t count — 
not to LawCent. He had the 
right to call me out — a full-scale 
Servo-to-Servo match — and the 
choice of weapons, ground, time, 
everything was his. 

Ctnpell the manager to clear 
floor number three,” the 
Sullivan rapped out to the 
Wayne. “My favorite ground.” 
He winked at Lorena. “Nine kills 
there, baby. My lucky spot.” 

“Whatever you say,” I felt

myself talking too fast. “I’ll be 
back here in an hour, raring to 
go.” 

“Nix, Cheapie. The time is 
now. Come as you are; I ain’t 
formal.” 

“Why, you can’t do that,” Lor- 
ena announced. Her voice tapes 
were off key, I noticed; she had 
a kind of shrill, whiney tone. 
“Barney’s only wearing that lit- 
tle old Arcaro!” 

“See me after, doll,” the Sulli- 
van cut her off. “I like your 
style.” He jerked his head at the 
Wayne. “I’ll take this clown 
bare-knuck, Mixie, Naples rules.” 
He turned away, flexing the over- 
sized arms that were an optional 
extra with the late-model Gen- 
dyes. Lorena popped to her feet, 
gave me the dirtiest look the 
Dietrich could handle. 

“You and that crummy Ar- 
caro.” She stuck it in me like a 
knife. “I wanted you to get a 
Flynn, with the — ” 

“Spare me the technical specs, 
kid,” I growled. I was getting the 
full picture of what I’d been 
suckered into. The caper with 
the soup hadn’t been any acci- 
dent. The timing was perfect; 
I had an idea the Liston was 
wired a lot better than he look- 
ed. Somebody with heavy credits 
riding on that night’s bout was 
behind it; somebody with enough 
at stake to buy all the muscle- 
Servos he needed to pound me 



into a set of loose nerve ends 
waving around like worms in a 
bait can. Busting the Arcaro into 
a pile of scrap metal and plastic 
wouldn’t hurt my Org physically 
— but the trauma to my person- 
ality, riding the Servo, would 
be for real. It took steel nerve, 
cast-iron confidence, razor-edge 
reflexes and a solid killer’s in- 
stinct to survive in the arena. 
After all, anybody could lay out 
for a Gargantua Servo, if that 
was all it took; the timing, and 
pace, and ringcraft that made me 
a winner couldn’t survive having 
a body pounded to rubble around 
me. I’d be lucky if I ever re- 
covered enough to hold a coffee 
cup one-handed. 

The Floor Manager arrived, 
looking indignant; nobody had 
called him to okay the fracas. 
He looked at me, started to 
wave me off, then did a double 
take. 

“This is the agressor party?” 
The eyebrows on his Menjou 
crawled up into his hairline. 

“That’s right,” I give it to him 
fast and snappy. “The bum in- 
sulted my lady-friend. Besides 
which, I don’t like his soup- 
strainer. After I break his rib 
cage down to chopsticks, I’m 
going to cut half of it off and 
give it to the pup to play with.” 
After all, if I was going to get 
pulverized, I might as well do 
it in style.

“You can talk better than 
that.” I pushed up close to him; 
my nose was on a level with the 
diamond stickpin in his paisley 
foulard. “What’s your name, Big 
Stuff? Let’s have that registra- 
tion.” 

“None of your pidgin, Wisey.” 
He had a finger all ready to poke 
at me, saw the Monitor coming 
up ready to quote rules, used it 
to scratch his ear instead. The 
big square fingernail shredded 
plastic off the lobe; he was a 
little more nervous than he act- 
ed. That cinched it: he knew 
who I was — Barney Ramm, 
light-heavy champ in the armed 
singles. 



U A ssembly and serial num- 
-**-bers, please,” the Monitor 
said. He sounded a little im- 
patient. I could see why he might. 
It was customary for a challenger 
to give with the plate data with- 
out being asked — especially a 
floor-vet like Sullivan. He was 
giving the official a dirty look. 
“Where’s Slickey?” he growled. 
“He doesn’t come on for an- 
other fifteen minutes,” the Mon- 
itor snapped. “Look here — ” 
“You look here, Short-timer,” 
the Sullivan grunted. The Wayne 
moved up to help him give the 
fellow the cold eye. He glared 
back at them — for about two 
seconds. Then he wilted. The 



message had gotten through. The 
fix was in.- 

“Where’s the men’s room?” I 
piped up, trying to sound as fris- 
ky as ever, but at the moment 
my mind felt as easy to read as 
a ninety-foot glare-sign. 

“Eh?” The Monitor cut his 
eyes at me, back at the Sullivan, 
back to me, like a badminton fan 
at a championship match. “No,” 
he said. He pushed out his lips 
and shook his head. “I’m rul- 
ing — 

“Rule my foot.” I jostled him 
going past. “I know my rights.” 
I kept going, marched across the 
dance floor to the discreet door 
back of the phony palm tree. In- 
side, I went into high gear. There 
was a row of coin-operated buff- 
ing and circuit-checking machines 
down one wall, a power core dis- 
penser, a plug-in recharge unit, 
a nice rack of touch-up paints, 
a big bin of burned-out reflex 
coils, and a dispenser full of re- 
placement gaskets with a sign 
reading FOR SAFETY’S SAKE 
—PREVENTS HOT BEAR- 
INGS. 

I skidded past them, dived 
through an archway into the ser- 
vice area. There were half a 
dozen padded racks here, loops 
of power leads, festoons of lube 
conduit leading down from ceil- 
ing-mounted manifolds. A parts 
index covered the far wall. There 
was no back door.

“Kindly take (click) position 
numbered one,” a canned voice 
cackled at me. “Use the console 
provided to indicate required ser- 
vices. Say, fellow, may I recom- 
mend this week’s special, Slid- 
eeze, the underarm lubricant with 
a diff — ” 

I slapped the control plate to 
shut the pitch off. Coming in 
here suddenly didn’t seem as 
cute as it had ten seconds earlier. 
I was cornered — and an accident 
on a lube-rack would save any 
possible slip-up on the floor. A 
little voice about as subtle as 
a jack-hammer was yelling in 
my ear that I had half a minute, 
if I was lucky, before a pair 
of heavies came through the door 
to check me out .... 

It was three quick steps to the 
little stub wall that protected the 
customers from the public eye. 
I flattened myself against the 
wall beside it just as big feet 
clumped outside. The door 
banged open. The Wayne wasn’t 
bothering about being subtle. I 
wasn’t either. I hooked his left 
instep, spun in behind him, 
palmed his back hard. He hit 
face-first with a slam like two 
garbage flats colliding, and start- 
ed looping the loop on the tiled 
floor. Those Waynes always did 
have a glass jaw. I didn’t stick 
around to see if anybody heard 
him pile in; I jumped him, slid 
out through the door. The Lis- 



ton was standing on the other 
side of the palm, not ten feet 
away. I faded to the right, saw 
another door. The glare sign 
above it said LADIES. I thought 
it over for about as long as it 
takes a clock to say ‘tick’ and 
dived through. 

Ill 

E ven under the circumstances 
it was kind of a shock to 
find myself standing there star- 
ing at pink and turquoise service 
racks, gold-plated perfume dis- 
pensers, and a big display rack 
full of strictly feminine spares 
that were enough to make a 
horse blush. 

Then I saw her. She was a 
neat-looking Pickford — the tra- 
ditional models were big just 
then. She had fluffy blonde hair, 
and her chassis covers were off 
to the waist. I gaped at her, sit- 
ting there in front of the mirror, 
then gulped like a seal swallow- 
ing a five-pound salmon. She 
jumped and swiveled my way, 
and I got a load of big blue eyes 
and a rosebud mouth that was 
opening up to scream. 

“Don’t yell, lady!” I averted 
my eyes — an effort like up- 
rooting saplings. “The mob’s af- 
ter me. Just tell me how to get 
out of here!” 

I heard feet outside. So did 
she, I guess.

“You — you can go out 
through the delivery door,” a 
nice little voice said. I flicked 
an eye her way. She was holding 
a lacy little something over her 
chest. It slipped when she point- 
ed and I got an eyeful of some 
of the nicest moulded foam- 
plastic you’d care to see. 

“Thanks, baby; you’re a doll,” 
I choked out and went past her, 
not without a few regrets. The 
door she’d showed me was 
around a corner at the back. 
There was a big carton full of 
refills for the cosmetics vendor 
beside it, with the top open. On 
impulse, I reached in and grabbed 
one going past. 

The door opened into an alley 



about four feet wide, with a sin- 
gle-rail robo-track down the cen- 
ter for service and delivery 
mechs. The wall opposite was 
plain duralith; it went up, a 
sheer rise without a foothold for 
a gnat. In both directions the 
alley was a straight shot for fifty 
feet to a rectangle of hard late- 
afternoon sunlight. I could take 
my choice. 

Something clattered to the 
right. I saw a small custodial 
cart move jerkily out of a door- 
way, swing my way, picking up 
speed. I started to back away; 
the thing was heavy enough to 
flatten my Arcaro without slow- 
ing down. Then a red light blink- 
ed on the front of the thing. It 




made screechy noises and skid- 
ded to a stop. 

“Kindly clear the rail,” a fruity 
voice hooted. “This is your busy 
Sani-mat Service Unit, bringing 
that Sani-mat sparkle to another 
satisfied customer!” 

A kind of idea formed up some- 
where under my hairpiece. 
I eased around to the side of 
the machine, a tight squeeze. It 
was a squatty, boxy job, with a 
bunch of cleaning attachments 
racked in front and a good-sized 
bin behind, half full of what it 
had been collecting. I got the lip 
up, climbed up as it started for- 
ward again, and settled down in 
the cargo. It was lumpy and 
wet, and you could have ham- 
mered the aroma out into horse- 
shoes. I guess the world has 
made a lot of progress in the 
last few decades, but garbage 
still smells like garbage. 

I estimated I’d covered a hun- 
dred feet or less, when the cart 
braked to a sudden stop. I heard 
voices; something clicked and a 
hum started up near my left 
ear. 

“Kindly clear the rail,” the 
tape said. “This is your Sani- 
mat Service Uuwwrrr — ” 

The cart jumped and I got 
another faceful of garbage. Some- 
body — it sounded like the 
Wayne — yelled something. I 
got set, ready to come out swing- 

THE BODY BUILDERS 



ing as soon as the lid went up. 
But the voices faded out, and 
I heard running feet. The cart 
started up, bumped along cluck- 
ing to itself like a chicken look- 
ing for a place to drop an egg. 
I rode it along to its next client’s 
back door, then hopped out, 
legged it to a public screen booth 
and dialled Gully’s number. 

IV 

I caught him in a cab, just drop- 
ping in past a mixed-up view 
of city skyline tilting by in the 
background. His eyes bugged out 
like a Chihuahua when I told 
him — a de luxe feature of the 
four-year-old Cantor he always 
wore. 

“Barney, you nuts?” He had a 
yelp like a Chihuahua too. “The 
biggest bout of your career com- 
ing up tonight, and you’re mix- 
ing in a free brawl!” He stopped 
to gulp and ran his eyes over 
me. “Hey, Barney! You’re wear- 
ing an Arcaro. You didn’t — ” 
“The fracas wasn’t my idea,” 
I got in quick while he was 
fighting the Cantor’s tonsils back 
in line. “Not exactly, anyway. 
I took off out the back way, 
and — ” 

“You did what?” The yelp was 
up into the supersonic now. 

“I beat it. Ducked out. Scram- 
med. What do you think I was 
going to do, stay there and let 



17 



that elbow squad pull the legs 
off me like a fly?” 

“You can’t run out on a regis- 
tered satisfaction, Barney!” Gully 
leaned into his sender until all 
I could see were two eyes like 
bloodshot clams and a pair of 
quivering nostrils. “You, of all 
people! If the Pictonews services 
get hold of this, they’ll murder 
you!” 

“This hit squad will murder 
me quicker — and not just on 
paper!” 

“Paper’s what I’m talking 
about! You’re the aggressor par- 
ty; you poked the schlock! You 
cop a swiftie on this, and you’re 
a fugitive from LawCent! They’ll 
lift your Servo license, and it’ll 
be good-by career! And the 
fines — ” 

“Okay — but I got a few rights 
too! If I can get to another 
Servo before they grab me, it’ll 
become my legal Corpus operan- 
di as soon as I’m in it. Remem- 
ber, that Satisfaction is to me, 
Barney Rum, not to this body 
I’m wearing. You’ve got to get 
me out of here, and back to my 
apartment — ” I felt my mouth 
freeze in the open position. Fif- 
ty feet away across the Fast- 
walk the Liston and a new 
heavy, a big, patched-up Baer, 
had come out of a doorway and 
were standing there, looking over 
the crowd. Those boys were as 
hard to shake loose as gum on 

18 



a shoe sole. I ducked down in 
the booth. 

“Listen, Gully,” I hissed. 
“They’re too close; I’ve got to 
do a fast fade. Try to fix it 
with LawCent to keep their mitts 
off me until I can change. Re- 
member, if they catch me, you 
'can kiss your ten per cent good- 
by.” 

“Barney, where you going? 
Whattaya mean, ten per cent? 
It ain’t the cookies I’m think- 
ing about!” 

“Think about the cookies, Gul- 
ly.” I cut contact and risked a 
peek. The two goons were still 
there, and looking my way. If 
I stepped out, they’d have me. 
And if I stayed where I was, 
sooner or later they’d get around 
to checking the booth .... 

I was still holding something 
in my hand. I looked at it: 
the cosmetics kit I’d grabbed 
on the way out of the ladies’ 
room at the Troc. 

The lid flipped back when I 
touched the little gold button at 
the side. There were nine shades 
of eye shadow, mouth paint, plas- 
tic lens shades in gold, green and 
pink — some dames have got 
screwy ideas about what looks 
attractive — spare eyebrows and 
lashes, a little emergency face 
putty, some thimble-sized hair 
sprays. 

I hated to ruin a hundred cee 

GALAXY 



wig, but I gave it a full shot of 
something called Silver Ghost. 
The pink eyes seemed to go with 
the hair. The spray was all gone, 
so it was too late to bleach out a 
set of eyebrows, so I used a pair 
of high-arched black ones, then 
used a gingery set for a mus- 
tache. I thought about using one 
of the fake spit-curls for a goatee, 
but decided against it. The Ar- 
caro had a nice-sized nose on it, 
so I widened the nostrils a lit- 
tle and added warts. I risked 
another peek. The boys were 
right where I left them. 

My jacket was a nice char- 
treuse job with cerise strips and 
a solid orange lining. I turned it 
inside out, ditched the yellow 
tie, and opened my shirt collar 
so the violet part showed. That 
was about all I could do; I 
opened the door and stepped 
out. 

I’d gone about three steps 
when the Camera looked my 
way. His mouth dropped open 
like a power shovel getting ready 
to take a bit out of a hillside. 
He jammed an elbow into the 
Liston and he turned around and 
his mouth fell open. I got a 
glimpse of some nice white chop- 
pers and a tongue like a pink 
sock. I didn’t wait to catch the 
rest of the reaction: I sprinted 
for the nearest shelter, a pair 
of swinging doors, just opening 
to let a fat Orggie out. 



I dived past him into a cool, 
dark room lit by a couple of 
glowing beer ads above a long 
mirror with a row of bottles. I 
charged past all that, slammed 
through a door at the back, and 
was out in an alley, looking at 
the Wayne. He went into a half- 
crouch and spread his arms. That 
was the kind of mistake an am- 
ateur toughie would make. I 
put my head down and hit him 
square under his vest button. 
It wasn’t the best treatment in 
the world for the Arcaro, but 
it was worse for the Wayne. He 
froze up and made a noise like 
frying fat, with his eyeballs spin- 
ning like Las Vegas cherries. Be- 
tween the fall in the john and 
the butt in the neuro center, he 
was through for the day. 

I got my legs under me and 
started off at a sort of crip- 
ple’s lope toward the end of the 
alley. 

My balance and coordination 
units were clicking like castan- 
ets. I richocheted off a couple 
of walls, made it out into the 
Slowwalk, and jigged along in 
a crabbed semicircle, making 
jerky motions with my good arm 
at a cab that picked then to 
drop a fare a few yards away. 
The hackie reached out, grabbed 
my shoulder and hauled me in- 
side. Those boys may be built 
into their seats and end at the

waist, but they’ve got an arm 
on them, I’ll give ’em that. 

“You look like you got a prob- 
lem there, Mac,” He looked me 
over in the mirror. “What hap- 
pened, you fall off a roof?” 

“Something like that. Just 
take me to the Banshire Build- 
ing, fast.” 

“Whatever you say, Bud. But 
if I was you, I’d get that servo 
to a shop as quick as I could.” 
“Later. Step on it.” 

“I’m doing a max and a half 
now!” 

“Okay, Okay, just don’t waste 
any time.” He muttered to him- 
self then, while I got the bent 
cover off my reset panel and did 
what I could to rebalance my 




circuitry. My double vision 
cleared a little, and the leg co- 
ordination improved enough so 
I managed to climb out unassis- 
ted when he slammed the heli in 
hard on the roof deck. 

“Be five cees,” the cabbie 
grunted. I paid him. “Stick 
around a few minutes,” I said. 
“I’ll be right back.” 

“Do me a favor, Clyde; throw 
your trade to the competition.” 
He flipped the flag up and lift- 
ed off in a cyclone of over-rewed 
rotors. I spat out a mouthful of 
grit and went in through the 
fancy door with the big gold B. 

Gus, the doorman came out 
of his cage with his admiral’s hat 
on crooked; he hooked a thumb 
over his shoulder and got his 
jaw all set for the snappy line. 
I beat him to it. 

“It’s me, Barney Ramm. I’m 
incommunicado to avoid the 
fans.” 

“Geeze, Mr. Ramm? Wow, 
that Arcaro won’t never be the 
same again. Looks like your fans 
must of caught you after all.” 
He showed me a bunch of teeth 
that would have looked at home 
in a mule’s face. I lifted a lip 
at him and went on in.

The Servo stall was the equal 
of anything at Municipal Files. I 
got enough cooperation out of 
my legs to hobble to it, got the 
Arcaro into the rack with the 
neck plate open and the con- 
tacts tight against the transfer 
disk. 

A pull on the locking lever, and 
I was clamped in tight, ready for 
the shift. I picked the Crockett; 
it was rugged enough to handle 
the Sullivan, and didn’t have any 
fancy equipment installed to have 
to look out for. It was a little 
tough coding the number into 
the panel, but I made it, then 
slammed the transfer switch. 

I’ve never gotten used to that 
wild couple of seconds while the 
highspeed scanner is stripping 
the stored data off one control 
matrix and printing it on another 
one linking it in to the Org brain 
back between my real ears in the 
cold files down town. It was like 
diving into an ocean of ice-cold 
darkness, spinning like a Roman 
candle. All kinds of data bits 
flash through the conscious level: 
I was the Arcaro, sitting rigid in 
the chair, and I was also the 
Crockett, clamped to a rack in 
the closet, and at the same time 
I could feel the skull contacts 
and servicing tubes and the cold 
slab under me in the Vault. Then 
it cleared and I was hitting the 
release lever and stepping out 
of tlie closet and beginning to

feel like a million bucks. 

The Arcaro looked pretty bad, 
sagging in the stall, with the 
phoney eyebrows out of line and 
the putty nose squashed, and the 
right shoulder humped up like 
Quasimodo. It was a wonder it 
had gotten me back at all. I 
made myself a promise to give 
it the best overhaul job money 
could buy — that was the least 
I could do. Then I headed for 
the front door. 

The Sullivan would get a little 
surprise when I found him now. 
I gave my coon-skin cap a pat 
as I went by the hall mirror, 
palmed the flush panel open and 
ran smack into four large cops, 
standing there waiting for me. 

21 



I t was a plush jail house, as 
jails go, but I still didn’t like 
it. They shoved me into a nice 
corner cell with a carpet, a tiled 
lube cubicle in the corner, and 
a window with a swell view of 
Granyauck — about 1800 feet 
straight down. There were no 
bars, but the wall was smooth 
enough to discourage any human 
flies from trying it. 

The turnkey looked me over 
and shook his head. He was wear- 
ing the regulation Police Spe- 
cial, a dumb-looking production 
job halfway between a Kildare 
and a Tracy — Spence, that is. 
I guess ' os have to have a uni- 
te' ., out the sight of a couple 
dozen identical twins stand- 
ing around kind of gives a fellow 
a funny feeling — like Servos 
were just some kind of robot, 
or something. 

“So you’re Barney Ramm, 
huh?” the cop shifted his tooth- 
pick to the other corner of his 
mouth. “You shunt of tried to 
handle four cops at once, Buddy. 
Your collision insurance don’t 
cover that kind of damage.” 

“I want my manager!” I yell- 
ed as loud as I could, which 
wasn’t very loud on account of 
a kick in the voice box I got 
following up too close on a cop 
I had tossed on his ear. “You 
can’t do this to me! I’ll get the 
lot of you for false arrest!” 
“Relax, Ramm.” The jailer 



waved his power-billie at me to 
remind me he had it. I shied off; 
a shot from the hot end of that 
would lock my neuro center in 
a hard knot. “You ain’t going 
no place for a while,” the cop 
stated. “Commissioner Malone 
wouldn’t like it.” 

“Malone? The Arena Com- 
missioner? What’s he got — ” I 
stopped in the middle of the 
yell, feeling my silly look freeze 
in place. 

“Yeah,” the cop said. “Also 
the Police Commissioner. Seems 
like Malone don’t like you, 
Ramm.” 

“Hey!” a dirty idea was grow- 
ing. “The satisfaction against 
me: who filed it?” 

The cop went through the 
motions of yawning. “Lessee . 
oh, yeah. A Mr. Malone.” 

“The dirty crook! That’s ille- 
gal! I was framed!” 

“You slugged him first, right?” 
The cop cut me off. 

“Sure, but — ” 

“Ain’t a Police Commissioner 
got as much right as anybody 
else to defend hisself? Any rea- 
son he’s got to take guff off some 
wisenheimer, any more than the 
next guy? You race him at the 
light, he’ll lock bumpers with 
you every time!” 

“I’ve got to get out of here,” 
I shouted him down. “Get Gully 
Fishbein! He’ll post the bond! 
I’ve got a bout at the Garden

in less than four hours! Tell the 
judge! I guess I’ve got a couple 
rights!” 

“You ain’t going to make no 
bout in no four hours.” The cop 
grinned like Sears foreclosing on 
Roebuck. “You’ll be lucky if 
you get out before Christmas 
Holidays start, in September.” 

“If I don’t,” I said, “you can 
start scanning the help-wanted- 
cripple column. That’s what 
you’ll be when me and my twen- 
ty-thousand Cee Charlemagne 
finish with you, you dumb flat- 
foot!” 

He narrowed his eyes down to 
pinpoints — an extra-cost fea- 
ture that the taxpayers had to 
spring for. “Threats, hah?” His 
voice had the old gravel in it 
now. “You run out on a Satis- 
faction, Buster. That’s trouble 
enough for most guys.” 

“I’ll show you trouble,” I 
started, but he wasn’t through 
yet. 

“ For a big tough arena 
fighter, you got kind of a deli- 
cate stomach, I guess. We also 
got you for resisting arrest, dam- 
aging public property, commit- 
ting mayhem on the person of a 
couple honest citizens, Peeping 
Tom and shop lifting from the 
ladies’ john. You’re set for to- 
night, pal — and a lotta other 
nights.” He gave me a mock 
salute and backed out; the glass 
door clinked in my face while 



I was still trying to get my arm 
back for a swing. 

nphe watch set in my left wrist 
-®- was smashed flat, along with 
the knuckles. Those Granyauck 
cops have got hard heads. I 
went over to the window and 
checked the sun. 

It looked like about half past 
four. At eight P.M. the main 
event would go on. If I wasn’t 
there, the challenger would take 
the title by default. He was an 
out-of-town phoney known as 
Mysterious Marvin, the Hooded 
Holocaust; he always fought with 
a flour sack over his ' After 
tonight, he’d be i: ght-liec\y 
champ, bagged he ’ and all — 
and I’d be a busted has-been, 
with my accounts frozen, my 
contract torn up, my Servo tic- 
ket lifted, and about as much 
future as a fifth of Bourbon at 
a Baptist Retreat. It was the 
finish. They had me. Unless . 

I poked my head out and look- 
ed down the wall. It was a sheer 
drop to a concrete loading apron 
that looked about the size of a 
blowout patch from where I 
stood. I felt my autonomies kick 
in; my heart started thumping 
like an out-of-round drive shaft, 
and my throat closed up like a 
crap-shooter’s fist. I never had 
liked heights much. But with my 
Servo locked in a cell — and me 
locked in the Servo —

I took a couple turns up and 
down the cell. It was an idea the 
boys talked about sometimes, 
waiting in the service racks be- 
fore a bout: what would hap- 
pen if the plastic-foam and wire- 
sponge information correlation 
unit where the whole brain pat- 
tern was recorded got smashed 
flat — wiped out — while you 
were in it? 

It would be like dreaming you 
fell — and hit. Would you ever 
wake up? The Org body was safe, 
back in the Vaults, but the shock 
— what would it do to you? 

There were a lot of theories. 
Some of the guys said it would 
be curtains. The end. Some of 
them said your Org would go 
catatonic. I didn’t know, myself. 
If the wheels knew, they weren’t 
spreading it around. 

And there was just the one 
way to find out for sure. 

If I stayed where I was, in- 
communicado, I was finished 
anyway. Better to go out in 
style. Before I could change my 
mind, I whirled, went to the 
window and swung my legs over 
the sill. Behind me, I heard 
somebody yell, “Hey!” I tried 
to swallow, couldn’t, squeezed 
my eyes shut, and jumped. For 
a few seconds, it was like a tor- 
nado blowing straight up into 
my face; then it was like being 
spread-eagled on a big, soft, 
rubbery mattress. And then — 



I was drowning in a sea of ran- 
cid fat. I took a deep breath 
to yell, and the grease in my 
lungs clogged solid. 

I tried to cough, and couldn’t 
•do that either. Little red sky- 
rockets started shooting around 
back of my eyes like a fire in a 
fireworks factory. Then the lights 
ran together and I was staring at 
a long red glare strip set in a 
dark ceiling a few inches above 
my face. I could feel tubes and 
wires dragging at my arms and 
legs, my neck, my eyelids, my 
tongue . 

I was moving, sliding out into 
brighter light. A scared-looking 
face was gaping down at me. I 
made gargly noises and flapped 
my hands — about all I could 
manage under the load of spa- 
ghetti. The guy leaning over me 
jumped like a morgue attendant 
seeing one of his customers sit 
up and ask for a light, whicn 
wasn’t too far off, maybe. My 
bet had paid off. I was awake, 
back in my organic body in slot 
number 99971-Ga8b in the Mun- 
icipal Body Files. 

The next half hour was a lit- 
tle hectic. First they started some 
kind of a pump, and then I 
could breathe — a little. While 
I coughed, twitched, groaned, 
itched, throbbed and ached in 
more places than I knew I had,

the file techs fussed over me like 
midwives delivering a TV baby. 
They pulled things out, stuck 
things in, sprayed me, jabbed 
me, tapped and tested, conferred, 
complained, ran back and forth, 
shone lights in my eyes, hit me 
with little hammers, poked 
things down my throat, held buz- 
zers to my eats, asked questions 
and bitched at each other in 
high, whining voices like blue- 
bottle flies around a honey wag- 
on. I got the general idea. They 
were unhappy that I had upset 
the routine by coming out of a 
stage three storage state unan- 
nounced. 

“There are laws against this 
sort of thing!” a dancey little 
bird in an unhealthy-looking Org 
body kept yelling at me. “You 
might have died! It was sheer 
good fortune that I happened 
to have slipped back in the stacks 
to commune with myself, and 
heard you choking! You fright- 
ened me out of my wits!” 

Somebody else shoved a clip- 
board in front of me. “Sign this,” 
he said. “It’s a release covering 
CentFiles against any malprac- 
tice or damage claims.” 

“And there’ll be an extra ser- 
vice charge on your file for 
emergency reprocessing,” the 
dancey one said. “You’ll have to 
sign that, and also an authoriza- 
tion to transfer you to dead stor- 
age until your next of kin or 



authorized agent brings in the 
Servo data — ” 

I managed to sit up. “Skip 
the reprocessing,” I said. “And 
the dead storage. Just get me on 
my feet and show me the door.” 
“Hows that? You’re going to 
need at least a week’s rest, a 
month’s retraining, and a com- 
plete reorientation course before 
you can be released in Org — ” 
“Get me some clothes,” I said. 
“Then I’ll sign the papers.” 

“This is blackmail!” Dancey 
did a couple of steps. “I won’t 
be held responsible!” 

“Not if you cooperate. Call 
me a cab.” I tried walking. 1 
was shakey, but all things con- 
sidered I didn’t feel too bad — 
for a guy who just committed 
suicide. Files had kept me in 
good condition. 

There was a little more argu- 
ment, but I won. Dancey follow- 
ed me out, wagging his head and 
complaining, but I signed his pa- 
pers and he disappeared — prob- 
ably to finish communing with 
himself. 

I n the cab, I tried to reach 
Gully again. His line was 
busy. I tried Lorena. A canned 
voice told me her line was dis- 
connected. Swell. All my old 
associates were kind of fading 
out of sight, now that I was hav- 
ing troubles with the law. 

But maybe Gully was just 

25 



THE BODY BUILDERS 



busy getting me a postponement. 
In fact, he was probably over at 
the Garden now, straightening 
things out. I gave the hackie 
directions and he dropped me 
by the big stone arch with the 
deep-cut letters that said 
FIGHTERS ENTRANCE. 

The usual crowd of fight fans 
were there, forty deep. None of 
them gave me a look; they had 
their eyes on the big, wide- 
shouldered Tunneys and Louises 
and Marcianos, and the hammed- 
up Herkys and Tarzans in their 
flashy costumes and big smiles, 
with their handlers herding them 
along like tugs nudging liners 
into dock. The gateman put out 
a hand to stop me when I started 
through the turnstile. 

“It’s me, Harley. Barney 
Ramm,” I said. A couple of har- 
ness cops were standing a few 
feet away, looking things over. 
“Let me through; I’m late.” 
“Hah? Barney — ” 

“Keep it quiet; I’m a sur- 
prise.” 

“Where’d you dig up that out- 
fit? On a used-Servo lot?” He 
looked me over like an inspector 
rejecting a wormy side of mut- 
ton. “What is it, a gag?” 

“It’s a long story. I’ll tell it 
to you some time. Right now, 
how’s about loaning me a tem- 
porary tag? I left my ID in my 
other pants.” 

“You pugs,” he muttered, but 



he handed over the pass. I grab- 
bed it. 

“Where’s Lou Mitch, the start- 
er?”! asked him. 

“Try the Registry Office.” 

I shoved through a crowd of 
weigh-in men, service techs and 
arena officials, spotted Lou talk- 
ing to a couple of trainers. I 
went over and grabbed his arm. 

“It’s me, Mitch, Barney Ramm. 
Listen, where’s Gully? I need — ” 

“Ramm, you bum! Where you 
been? Where’d you pick up that 
hulk you got on? Who you think 
you are, missing the press weigh- 
in? Get downstairs on the dou- 
ble and dress out? You got 
twenty minutes, and if you’re 
late, so help me, I’ll see you 
busted out of the fight game!” 

“Wha — who, me? Hold it, 
Lou, I’m not going out there in 
this condition! I just came down 
to — ” 

“Oh, a holdup for more dough, 
huh? Well, you can work that 
one out with the promoter and 
the Commissioner. All I know is, 
you got a contract, and I’ve got 
you billed for nineteen minutes 
from now!” 

I started backing away, shak- 
ing my head. “Wait a minute, 
Lou — ” 

He jerked his head at a couple 
of the trainers that were listen- 
ing in. “Grab him and take him 
down to his stall and get him 
into his gear! Hustle it!”

I put up a brisk resistance, but 
it was all wasted effort. Ten 
minutes later I was standing in 
the chute, strapped into harness 
with knots tied in the straps for 
fit any a copy of the Afternoon 
Late Racing Special padding my 
helmet up off my ears, listening 
to the mob in the stands up 
above, yelling for the next kill. 
Me. 

VII 

nphey can talk all they want 
about how sensitive and re- 
sponsive a good Servo is, but 
there’s nothing like flesh and 
blood for making you know 
you’re in trouble. 



My heart was kicking hard 
enough to jar the championship 
medal on my chest. My mouth 
was as dry as yesterday’s cin- 
namon toast. I thought about 
making a fast getaway over the 
barrier fence, but there was no- 
body outside who’d be glad to 
see me except the cops; besides 
which, I had a mace in my right 
hand and a fighting net in the 
left, and after all, I was Barney 
Ramm, the champ. I’d always 
said it was the man inside the 
Servo, not the equipment that 
counted. Tonight I had a chance 
to prove it — or a kind of a 
chance; an Org up against a 
fighting Servo wasn’t exactly an 
even match. 




But hell, when was it ever 
even? The whole fight game was 
controlled, from top to bottom, 
by a few sharpies like J. J. Ma- 
lone. Nobody had ever slipped 
me the word to take a dive yet, 
but I’d stretched plenty of bouts 
to make ’em look good. After all, 
the fans paid good creds to see 
two fine-tuned fighting machines 
pound each other to scrap under 
the lights. An easy win was 
taboo. Well, they’d get an un- 
expected bonus tonight when I 
got hit and something besides 
hydraulic fluid ran out. 

And then the blast of the 
bugles caught me like a bucket of 
ice water and the gate jumped 
up and I was striding through, 
head up, trying to look as arro- 
gant as a hunting tiger under the 
glare of the polyarcs, but feel- 
ing very small and very break- 
able and wondering why I hadn’t 
stayed in that nice safe jail while 
I had the chance. Out across the 
spread of the arena the bleachers 
rose up dark under the high late- 
evening sky streaked with long 
pink clouds that looked as re- 
mote as fairyland. And under 
the pooled lights, a big husky 
Servo was taking his bows, swirl- 
ing his cloak. 

He was too far away, over 
beyond the raised disk of the 
Circle, for me to be sure, but it 
looked like he was picking a 
heavy duty prod and nothing 

28 



else. Maybe the word had gone 
out that I was in Org; or maybe 
he was good. 

/ T~'hen he tossed the cape to a 
handler and came to meet 
me, sizing me up on the way 
through the slit in his mask. 

Maybe he was wondering what 
I had up my sleeve. If he was 
in on the fix, he’d be surprised 
to see me at all. He’d been ex- 
pecting a last-minute sub, or 
just a straight default. If not, 
he’d have been figuring on me 
wearing my Big Charley, packed 
with all the booster gear the law 
allows. Instead, all he saw was 
an ordinary-looking five foot 
eleven frame with medium-fair 
shoulders and maybe just a shade 
too much padding at the belt 
line. 

The boys back at Files had 
done right by me, I had to ad- 
mit. The old Org was in better 
shape than when I’d filed it, 
over a year ago. I felt strong, 
tough and light on my feet; I 
could feel the old fighting edge 
coming on. Maybe it was just a 
false lift from the stuff the techs 
had loaded me full of, and may- 
be it was just an animal’s com- 
bat instinct, an item they hadn’t 
been able to dream up an ac- 
cessory to imitate. Whatever it 
was, it was nice to have. 

I reached the concrete edge of 
the Fighting Circle and stepped 



GALAXY 



up on it and was looking across 
at the other fellow, only fifty 
feet away and now looking bigger 
than a Bolo Combat Unit. With 
the mask I wasn’t sure, but he 
looked like a modified Norge At- 
las. He was running through a 
fancy twirl routine with the prod, 
and the crowd was eating it up. 

There was no law that said I 
had to wait for him to finish. 
I slid the mace down to rest 
solid in my palm with the thong 
riding tight above my wrist and 
gave the two foot club a couple 
of practice swings. So much for 
the warm-up. I flipped the net 
out into casting position with 
my left hand and moved in on 
him. 

It wasn’t like wearing a Servo; 
I could feel sweat running down 
my face and the air sighing in 
my lungs and the blood pump- 
ing through my muscles and 
veins. It was kind of a strange 
alive feeling — as if there was 
nothing between me and the sky 
and the earth and I was part of 
them and they were part of me. 
A funny feeling. A dangerous, un- 
protected feeling — but some- 
how not entirely a bad feeling. 

Tie finished up the ham act 
when I was ten feet from 
him, swung to face me. He knew 
I was there, all right; he was 
just playing it cool. Swell. While 
he was playing, I’d take him. 



I feinted with the net, then 
dived in, swung the mace, missed 
him by half an inch as he 
back-pedaled. I followed him 
close, working the club, keeping 
the net cocked. He backed, look- 
ing me over. 

“Ramm — is that you in that 
get-up?” he barked. 

“Naw — I couldn’t make it, 
so I sent my cousin Julius.” 

“What happened, you switch 
brands? Looks like you must of 
got cut-rate merchandise.” He 
ducked a straight cut and whip- 
ped the prod around in a jab 
that would have paralyzed my 
neuro center if he’d connected. 

“New secret model a big out- 
fit’s trying out under wraps,” I 
told him . 

He made a fast move, and a 
long, slim rod I hadn’t seen be- 
fore whipped out and slapped 
me under the ribs. For a split 
second I froze. He had me, I 
was finished. A well-handled 
magnetic resonator could de- 
Gauss every micro-tape in a 
Servo — and his placement was 
perfect. 

But nothing happened. There 
was a little tingle, that was all. 

Then I got it. I wasn’t wear- 
ing a Servo — and magnets 
didn’t bother an Org. 

'Tphe Atlas was looking as con- 
fused as I was. He took an 
extra half-second recovering. 



THE BODY BUILDERS 



29 



That was almost enough. I clip- 
ped him across the thigh as he 
almost fell getting back. He tried 
with the switch again, sawed it 
across my chest. I let him; he 
might as well tickle me with a 
grass stem. This time I got the 
net out, snarled his left arm, 
brought the mace around and 
laid a good one across his hip. It 
staggered him, but he managed 
to spin out, flip the net clear. 

“What kind of shielding you 
got anyway, Ramm?” the Atlas 
growled. He held the rod out 
in front of his face, crossed his 
eyes at it, shook it hard and 
made one more try. I let him 
come in under my guard, and 
the shaft slid along my side as 
if he was trying to wipe it clean 
on my shirt. While he was busy 
with that, I dropped the net, 
got a two-handed grip in the 
mace, brought it around in a flat 
arc and laid a solid wallop right 
where it would do him the most 
good — square on the hip joint. 

I heard the socket go. He tried 
to pivot on his good leg, tot- 
tered and just managed to stay 
on his feet, swearing. I came in 
fast and just got a glimpse of 
the electro-pod coming up. Con- 
centrating on the magnetic rod, 
I’d forgotten the other. I tried 
to check and slide off to the 
right, but all of a sudden blind- 
ing blue lights were popping all 
over the sky. Something came 



up and hit me alongside the 
head, and then I was doing slow 
somersaults through pretty pur- 
ple clouds, trying hard to figure 
which side was up. Then the 
pain hit. For a couple of seconds 
I scraped at my chest, reaching 
for circut breakers that weren’t 
there. Then I got mad. 

It was as if all of a sudden, 
nothing could stop me. The Atlas 
was a target, and all I wanted 
was just to reach it. If there 
was a mountain in the way, I’d 
pick it up and throw it over my 
shoulder. A charging elephant 
would be a minor nuisance. I 
could even stand up, unassisted 
— if I tried hard enough. 

I got the feel of something 
solid under my hands, groped 
and found some more of it with 
my feet, pushed hard and blink- 
ed away the fog to see the Atlas 
just making it back onto his good 
leg. I had to rest a while then, 
on all fours. He stooped to twid- 
dle a reset for emergency power 
to the damaged joint, then start- 
ed for me, hopping hard enough 
to shake the ground. A little 
voice told me to wait .... 

He stopped, swung the prod 
up, and I rolled, grabbed his 
good leg, twisted with everything 
I had. It wasn’t enough. He 
hopped, jabbed with the prod, 
missed, and I was on my feet 
now, feeling like I’d been skinned 
and soaked in brine. My breath 



30 



GALAXY 



burned my throat like a blow 
torch, and all round the crowd 
roar was like a tidal wave rolling 
across a sinking continent. 

I backed, and he followed. I 
tried to figure the time until 
the pit stop, but I didn’t know 
how long I’d been out here; I 
didn’t have a timer ticking un- 
der my left ear, keeping me 
posted. And now the Atlas was 
on to what was going on. I knew 
that, when he reached for the 
show-knife strapped to his left 
hip. Against a Servo, that parti- 
cular tool was useless, but he 
could let the cool night air into 
an Org’s gizzard with it, and he 
knew it. 

Then my foot hit the edge of 
the paved circle and I went 
down, flat on my back on the 
sand. 

r T' 1 he Atlas came after me, and 
I scrambled back, got to my 
feet just in time. The knife- 
blade hissed through the air just 
under my chin. 

“You’ve had it, Ramm,” the 
Atlas said, and swung again. I 
tried to get the club up for a 
counter-blow but it was too 
heavy. I let it drop and drag in 
the sand. Through a dust-cloud 
we were making, I saw the Atlas 
fumbling with his control but- 
tons. Tears welled up in his eyes, 
sluiced down over his face. He 
didn’t like the dust any better 



than I did. Maybe not as well . 

I felt an idea pecking at its 
shell; a dirty idea, but better 
than none. 

The mace was dangling by its 
thong. I slipped it free, threw 
it at him; it clanged off his 
knees and I stooped, came up 
with a handful of fine sand and 
as he closed in threw it straight 
into his face. 

The effect was striking. His 
eyes turned to mud pockets. I 
stepped aside, and he went right 
past me, making swipes at the 
air with the big sticker, and I 
swung in behind him and tilted 
another handful down inside his 
neckband. I could hear it grate 
in the articulated rib armor as 
he came around. 

“Ramm, you lousy little — ” 
I took aim and placed a nice 
gob square in his vocabulary. He 
backed off, pumping emergency 
air to clear the pipes, spouting 
dust like Mount Aetna, but I 
knew I had him. The mouth ca- 
vity on just about every Servo 
in the market was a major lube 
duct; he had enough grit in his 
gears to stop a Continental Siege 
Unit. But his mouth was still 
open, so I funneled in another 
double handful. 

He stopped, locked his knee 
joints, and concentrated on his 
problem. That gave me my open- 
ing to reach out and switch his 
main circuit-breaker off. 



THE BODY BUILDERS 



31 



He froze. I waited half a min- 
ute for the dust to clear, while 
the crowd roar died away to a 
kind of confused buzzing, like 
robbed bees. 

Then I reached out, put a 
finger against his chest, and 
shoved — just gently. He leaned 
back, teetered for a second, then 
toppled over stiff as a lamp post. 
You could hear the thud all the 
way to the student bleachers. I 
held on for another ten seconds, 
just to make it look good, then 
kneeled over on top of him. 

VIII 

(, <, T) ut I was too late,” Gully 
Fishbein’s voice was com- 
ing up out of a barrel; a barrel 
full of thick molasses syrup 
somebody had dumped me into. 
I opened my mouth to complain 
and a noise like “glug” came out. 

“He’s awake!” Gully yelped. 
I started to deny it, but the ef- 
fort was too much. 

“Barney, I tried to catch 
you, but you were already out 
there.” Gully sounded indignant. 
“Cripes, kid, you should of 
known I wouldn’t let ’em railroad 
you!” 

“Don’t worry about Ramm,” a 
breezy voice jostled Gully’s 
aside. “Boy, this is the story of 
the decade! You figure to go up 
against a Servo again in Org, 
when you get out of the shop — 

32 



I mean hospital? How did it feel 
to take five thousand volts of 
DC? You know the experts say 
it should have killed you. It 
would have knocked out any 
Servo on the market — ” 

“Nix, Baby!” Gully elbowed 
his way back in again. “My 
boy’s gotta rest. And you can 
tell the world the Combo’s out 
of business. Now anybody can 
afford to fight. Me and Barney 
have put the game back in the 
hands of the people.” 

“Yeah! The sight of that Atlas, 
out on its feet — and Ramm 
here, in Org, yet, with one fin- 
ger . ” 

I unglued an eyelid and blink- 
ed at half a dozen fuzzy faces 
like custard pies floating around 

me. 

“We’ll talk contract with you, 
Fishbein,” somebody said. 

“ . call for some new reg- 
ulations,” somebody said. 

“ . dred thousand cees, 
first network rights.” 

“ . era of the Servo in the 
arena is over ...” 

“ . and maybe not just 
in the arena.” 

“ . hear what Malone says 
about this. Wow!” 

“Malone,” I heard my voice 
say, like a boot coming out of 
mud. “The cr . crook. It was 
him . put the Sullivan . 
up to it . ” 

“Up to nothing, Barney,” Gul- 

GALAXY 



ly was bending over me. “That 
was J. J. hisself in that Servo! 
And here’s the payoff. He regis- 
tered the satisfaction in his own 
name — and of course, every 
fighter in his stable is acting in 
his name, legally. So when you 
met Mysterious Marvin and 
knocked him on his duff you 
satisfied his claim. You’re in the 
clear, kid. You can relax. There’s 
nothing to worry about.” 

“Oh, Barney!” It was a new 
voice, a nice soft little squeal of 
a girl-voice. A neat little Org 
face with a turned-up nose zer- 
oed in on me, with a worried 
look in the big brown eyes. 

“Julie! Where — I mean, 
how . ? ” 

“I was there, Barney. I see 
all your fights, even if — even 
if I don’t approve. And today — 
oh, Barney, you were so brave, 
so marvelous, out there alone, 
against that machine ...” She 
sighed and nestled her head 
against my shoulder. 

“Gully,” I said. “Exactly how 
long have I got to stay in this 
place?” 

“The Servo-tech — I mean 
the doc — says a week anyway.” 

“Set up a wedding for a week 
from today.” 



J ulie jumped and stared at me. 

“Oh, Barney! But you — 
you know what I said . about 
those zombies . ” 

“I know.” 

“But, Barney ...” Gully 
didn’t know whether to cry or 
grin. “You mean . ?” 

“Sell my Servos,” I said. “The 
whole wardrobe. My days of be- 
ing a pair of TV eyes peeking 
out of a walking dummy and 
kidding myself I’m alive are 
over.” 

“Yeah, but Barney — a guy 
with your ideas about what’s fun 
— like skiing, and riding the jet- 
boards, and surfing, and sky-div- 
ing — you can’t take the risks! 
You only got the one Org Body!” 
“I found out a couple of things 
out there tonight, Gully. It takes 
a live appetite to make a meal 
a feast. From now on, whatever 
I do, it’ll be me doing it. Clock- 
ing records is okay, I guess, but 
there’s some things that it takes 
an Org to handle.” 

“Like what?” Gully yelled, 
and went on with a lot more in 
the same vein. I wasn’t listen- 
ing, though. I was too busy sav- 
oring a pair of warm, soft, live 
lips against mine.

HERESIES OF 
THE HUGE GOD 

by BRIAN W. ALDISS 



THE SECRET BOOK 
OF HARAD IV 

I , Harad IV, Chief Scribe, de- 
clare that this my writing 
may be shown only to priests of 
rank vithin the Orthodox Uni- 
versal Sacrificial Church and to 
the Elders Elect of the Council 
of the Orthodox Universal Sacri- 
ficial Church, because here are 
contained matters concerning the 
four Vile Heresies that may not 
be seen or spoken among the 
people. 

F or a Proper Consideration of 
the newest and vilest heresy, 
we must look in perspective over 
the events of history. According- 
ly, let us go back to the First 
Year of our epoch when the 
World Darkness was banished by 
the Huge God, our truest, biggest 



Lord, whom all honor and great- 
ly fear. 

From this present year, 910 
H.G., it is impossible to recall 
what the world was like then. 
But from the few records still 
surviving we can gather some- 
thing of those times and even 
perform the Mental Contortions 
necessary to see how the events 
must have looked to the sin- 
ners then involved in them. 

The world on which the Huge 
God found himself was full of 1 
people and their machines, all 
of them unprepared for his visit. 
There may have been a hundred 
thousand times more people than 
there are now. 

The Huge God landed in what 
is now the Sacred Sea, upon 
which in these days sail some 
of our most beautiful churches 
dedicated to his name. At that 



34 



time, the region was much less 
pleasing, being broken up into 
many states possessed by differ- 
ent nations. This was a system 
of land tenure practiced before 
our present policies of constant 
migration and evacuation were 
formed. 

The rear legs of the Huge God 
stretched far down into Africa — 
which was then not the island 
it now is — almost touching the 
Congo River, at the sacred spot 
marked now by the Sacrificial 
Church of Basoko-Aketi-Ele, and 
at the sacred spot marked now 
by the Temple Church of Aden, 
obliterating the old port of Aden. 

Some of the Huge God’s legs 
stretched above the Sudan and 
across what was then the Libyan 
Kingdom, now part of the Sea of 
Elder Sorrow, while a foot rested 
in a city called Tunis on what 
was then the Tunisian shore. 
These were some of the legs of 
the Huge God on his left side. 

On his right side, his legs 
blessed and pressed the sands of 
Saudi Arabia, now called Life 
Valley, and the foothills of the 
Caucasus, obliterating the Mount 
called Ararat in Asia Minor, 
while the Foremost Leg stretched 
forward to Russian lands, stamp- 
ing out immediately the great 
capital city of Moscow. 

The body of the Huge God, 
resting in repose between his 
mighty legs, settled mainly over 

HERESIES OF THE HUGE GOD 



three ancient seas, if the Old 
Records are to be trusted, called 
the Sea of Mediterranean, the 
Red Sea, and the Nile Sea, all 
of which now form part of the 
Sacred Sea. He eradicated also 
with his Great Bulk part of the 
Black Sea, now called the White 
Sea, Egypt, Athens, Cyprus and 
the Balkan Peninsula as far 
north as Belgrade, now Holy 
Belgrade, for above this town 
towered the neck of the Huge 
God on his First Visit to us 
mortals, just clearing the roofs 
of the houses. 

As for his head, it lifted above 
the region of mountains that 
we call Ittaland, which was then 
named Europe, a populous part 
of the globe, raised so high that 
it might easily be seen on a 
clear day from London, then as 
now the chief town of the land 
of the Anglo-French. 

It was estimated in those first 
days that the length of the Huge 
God was some four and a half 
thousand miles, from rear to nose, 
with the eight legs each about 
nine hundred miles long. Now 
we profess in our Creed that our 
Huge God changes shape and 
length and number of legs ac- 
cording to whether he is Pleased 
or Angry with man. 

In those days, the nature of 
God was unknown. No prepar- 
ation had been made for his 
coming, though some whispers 

35 



of the millenium were circulat- 
ing. Accordingly, the specula- 
tion on his nature was far from 
the truth, and often extremely 
blasphemous. 

IT ere is an extract from the no- 
A A torious Gersheimer Paper, 
which contributed much to the 
events leading up to the First 
Crusade in 271 H.G. We do not 
know who the Black Gersheimer 
was, apart from the meaningless 
fact that he was a Scientific Pro- 
phet at somewhere called Cornell 
or Carnell, evidently a Church 
on the American Continent 
(then a differently shaped terri- 
tory). 

“Aerial surveys suggest that 
this creature — if one can call it 
that — which straddles a line 
along the Red Sea and across 
southeast Europe, is non-living, 
at least as we understand life. It 
may be merely coincidence that 
it somewhat resembles an eight- 
footed lizard, so that we do not 
necessarily have to worry about 
the thing being malignant, as 
some tabloids have suggested.” 

Not all the vile jargon of that 
distant day is now understand- 
able, but we believe “aerial sur- 
veys” to refer to the mechanical 
flying machines which this last 
generation of the Godless pos- 
sessed. Black Gersheimer contin- 
ues: 

“If this thing is not life, it may 



be a piece of galactic debris 
clinging momentarily to the 
globe, perhaps like a leaf clinging 
to a football in the fall. To be- 
lieve this is not necessarily to al- 
ter our scientific concepts of tire 
universe. Whether the thing rep- 
resents life or not, we don’t have 
to go all superstitious. We must 
merely remind ourselves that 
there are many phenomena in 
the universe as we conceive it in 
the light of twentieth-ceitury 
science which remain unknown 
to us. However painful this un- 
wanted visitation may be, it is 
some consolation to think that it 
will bring us new knowledge — 
of ourselves, as well as of the 
world outside our solar system.” 

Although terms like “galactic 
debris” have lost their meaning, 
if they ever had one, tire general 
trend of this passage is offensive- 
ly obvious. An embargo is being 
set up against the worship of the 
Huge God, with a heretical God 
of Science set up in his stead. 
Only one other passage from this 
offensive mishmash need be con- 
sidered, but it is a vital one for 
showing the attitude of mind of 
Gersheimer and presumably 
most of his contemporaries. 

“Naturally enough, the peoples 
of the world, particularly those 
who are still lingering on the 
threshold of civilization, are full 
of fear these days. They see 
something supernatural in the at 



36 



GALAXY 



rival of this thing, and I believe 
that every man, if he is honest, 
will admit to carrying an echo of 
that fear in his heart. We can 
only banish it, and can only meet 
the chaos into which the world 
is now plunged, if we retain a 
galactic picture of our situation 
in our minds. The very hugeness 
of this thing that now lies plas- 
tered loathsomely across our 
world is cause for terror. But im- 
agine it in proportion. A centi- 
pede is sitting on an orange. Or, 
to pick an analogy that sounds 
less repulsive, a little gecko, six 
inches long, is resting momentar- 
ily on a plastic globe of the Earth 
which is two feet in diameter. It 
is up to us, the human race, with 
all the technological forces at our 
disposal, to unite as never before, 
and blow this thing, this large 
and stupid object, into the depths 
of space from whence it came. 
Good night.” 

jV/Ty reasons for repeating this 
1 1 initial blasphemy are these : 

that we can see here in this mes- 
sage from a member of the World 
Darkness traces of that original 
sin which — with all our sacrifices, 
all our hardships, all our cru- 
sades — we have not yet stamped 
out. That is why we are now at 
the greatest Crisis in the history 
of tire Orthodox Universal Sacri- 
ficial Church, and why the time 
has come for a Fourth Crusade. 



The Huge God remained 
where he was, in what we now 
refer to as the Sacred Sea Posi- 
tion, for a number of years, ab- 
solutely unmoving. 

For mankind, this was the great 
formative period of Belief, mark- 
ing the establishment of the Uni- 
versal Church, and characterized 
by many upheavals. The early 
priests and prophets suffered 
much that the Word might go 
round the World, and the blas- 
phemous sects be destroyed, 
though the Underground Book of 
Church Lore suggests that many 
of them were in fact members of 
earlier churches who, seeing the 
light, transferred their allegianc- 
es. 

The mighty figure of the Huge 
God was subjected to many puny 
insults. The Greatest Weapons 
of that distant age, forces of tech- 
nical charlatanry, were called 
Nuclears. These were dropped on 
the Huge God — without having 
any effect, as might be expected. 
Walls of fire burnt against him in 
vain. Our Huge God, whom all 
honor and fear, is immune from 
earthly weakness. His body was 
clothed as it were with Metal — 
here lay the seed of the Second 
Crusade — but it had not the 
weakness of metal. 

His coming to earth met with 
immediate response from na- 
ture. The old winds that pre- 
vailed were turned aside about 



HERESIES OF THE HUGE GOD 



37 



his mighty flanks and blew else- 
where. The effect was to cool the 
center of Africa, so that the trop- 
ical rain forests died and all the 
creatures in them. In the lands 
bordering Caspana (then called 
Persia and Kharkov, say some 
old accounts), hurricanes of snow 
fell in a dozen severe winters, 
blowing far east into India. Else- 
where, all over the world, the 
coming of the Huge God was felt 
in the skies, and in freak rain- 
falls and errant winds, and 
month-long storms. The oceans 
also were disturbed, while the 
great volume of waters displaced 
by his body poured over the near- 
by land, killing many thousands 
of beings and washing away ten 
thousand dead whales. 

The land too joined in the up- 
heaval. While the territory under 
the Huge God’s bulk sank, pre- 
paring to receive what would 
later be the Sacred Sea, the land 
roundabout rose up, forming 
small hills, such as the broken 
and savage Dolomines that now 
guard the southern lands of Itta- 
land. There were earthquakes 
and new volcanoes and geysers 
where water never spurted before 
and plagues of snakes and blaz- 
ing forests and many wonderful 
signs that helped the Early Fath- 
ers of our faith to convert the ig- 
norant. Everywhere they went, 
preaching that only in surrender 
to him lay salvation. 



Many Whole Peoples perished 
at this time of upheaval, such as 
the Bulgarians, the Egyptians, 
the Israelites, Moravians, Kurds, 
Turks, Syrians, Mountain 
‘ Turks, as well as most of the 
South Slavs, Georgians, Croats, 
the sturdy Vlaks, and the Greeks 
and Cypriotic and Cretan races, 
together with others whose sins 
were great and names unrecorded 
in the annals of the church. 

The Huge God departed from 
the world in the year 89, or some 
say 90. (This was the First De- 
parture, and is celebrated as such 
in our Church calendar — though 
the Catholic Universal Church 
calls it First Disappearance 
Day.) 

He returned in 91, great and 
aweing be his name. 

T ittle is known of the period 
^ when he was absent from 
our Earth. We get a glimpse in- 
to the mind of the people then 
when we learn that in the main 
the nations of Earth greatly re- 
joiced. The natural upheavals 
continued, since the oceans 
poured into the great hollow he 
had made, forming our beloved 
and holy Sacred Sea. Great Wars 
broke out across the face of the 
globe. 

His return in 91 halted the 
wars — a sign of the great peace 
his presence has brought to his 
chosen people.

But the inhabitants of the 
world at That Time were not all 
of our religion, though prophets 
moved among them, and many 
were their blasphemies. In the 
Black Museum attached to the 
great basilica of Omar and Yem- 
en is documentary evidence that 
they tried at this period to com- 
municate with the Huge God by 
means of their machines. Of 
course they got no reply — but 
many men reasoned at this time, 
in the darkness of their minds, 
that this was because the God 
was a Thing, as Black Gersheim- 
er had prophesied. 

The Huge God, on this his Sec- 
ond Coming, blessed our Earth 
by settling mainly within the Arc- 
tic Circle, or what was then the 
Arctic Circle, with his body 
straddling from northern Canada, 
as it was, over a large peninsula 
called Alaska, across the Bering 
Sea and into the northern regions 
of the Russian lands as far as the 
River Lena, now the Bay of 
Lcnn. Some of his rear feet broke 
far into the Arctic Ice, while oth- 
ers of his forefeet entered the 
North Pacific Ocean — but truly 
to him we are but sand under his 
feet, and he is indifferent to our 
mountains or our Climatic Varia- 
tions. 

As for his terrible head, it 
could be seen reaching far into 
the stratosphere, gleaming with 
metal sheen, by all the cities 

HERESIES OF THE HUGE GOD 



along the northern part of Amer- 
ica’s seaboard, from such van- 
ished towns as Vancouver, Seat- 
tle, Edmonton, Portland, Blanco, 
Reno, and even San Francisco. 
It was the energetic and sinful 
nation that possessed these cities 
that was now most active against 
the Huge God. The weight of 
their ungodly scientific civiliza- 
tion was turned against him, but 
all they managed to do was blow 
apart their own coastline. 

Meanwhile, other natural 
changes were taking place. The 
mass of the Huge God deflected 
the earth in its daily roll, so that 
seasons changed, and in the pro- 
phetic books we read how the 
great trees brought forth their 
leaves to cover them in the win- 
ter, and lost them in the summer. 
Bats flew in the daytime and 
women bore forth hairy children. 
The melting of the ice caps 
caused great floods, tidal waves 
and poisonous dews, While in one 
night we hear that the waters of 
the Deep were moved, so that the 
tide went out so far from the 
Malayan Uplands (as they now 
are) that the continental penin- 
sula of Blestland was formed in a 
few hours of what had previous- 
ly been separate Continents or 
Islands called Singapore, Suma- 
tra, Indonesia, Java, Sydney, and 
Australia or Austria. 

With these powerful signs, our 
priests could Convert the People, 

39 



and millions of survivors were 
speedily enrolled into the Church. 
This was the First Great Age of 
the Church, when the word 
spread across all the ravaged and 
transformed globe. Our institu- 
tions were formed in the next 
few generations, notably at the 
various Councils of the New 
Church (some of which have 
since proved to be heretical). 

\XTe were not established with- 
’ ' out some difficulty. Many 
people had to be burned before 
the rest could feel the faith Burn- 
ing in Them. But as generations 
passed, the True Name of the 
God emerged over a wider and 
wider area. 

Only the Americans still clung 
largely to their base superstition. 
Fortified by their science, they 
refused Grace. So in the Year 271 
the First Crusade was launched, 
chiefly against them but also 
against the Irish, whose heretical 
views had no benefit of science. 
The Irish were quickly Eradicat- 
ed, almost to a man. The Amer- 
icans were more formidable, but 
this difficulty served only to draw 
the people closer and unite the 
Church further. 

This First Crusade was fought 
over the First Great Heresy of 
the Church, the heresy claiming 
that the Huge God was a Thing 
not a God, as formulated by 
Black Gersheimer. It was suc- 



cessfully concluded when the 
leader of the Americans, Lionel 
Undermeyer, met the Venerable 
World Emperor-Bishop, Jon II, 
and agreed that the messengers 
of the Church should be free to 
preach unmolested in America. 
Possibly a harsher decision could 
have been forced, as some com- 
mentators claim, but by this time 
both sides were suffering severe- 
ly from plague and famine, the 
harvests of the world having 
failed. It was a happy chance 
that the population of the world 
was already cut by more than 
half, or complete starvation 
would have followed the reor- 
ganization of the seasons. 

In the churches of the world, 
the Huge God was asked to give 
a sign that he had witnessed the 
great victory over the American 
unbelievers. All who opposed this 
enlightened act were destroyed. 
He answered the prayers in 297 
by moving swiftly forward only a 
comparatively Small Amount 
and lying Mainly in the Pacific 
Ocean, stretching almost as far 
south as what is now the Antar- 
ter, what was then the The 
Tropic of Capricorn, and what 
had previously been the Equator. 
Some of his left legs covered the 
towns along the west American 
seaboard as far south as Guadal- 
jara (where the impression of his 
foot is still marked by the 
Temple of the Sacred Toe), in- 



40 



GALAXY 



eluding some of the towns such 
as San Francisco already men- 
tioned. We speak of this as the 
First Shift; it was rightly taken 
as a striking proof of the Huge 
God’s contempt for America. 

Hphis feeling became rife in 
America also. Purified by 
famine, plague, gigantic earth 
tremors and other natural disor- 
ders, the population could now 
better accept the words of the 
priests, all becoming converted to 
a man. Mass pilgrimages were 
made to see the great body of 
the Huge God, stretching from 
one end of their nation to the 
other. Bolder pilgrims climbed 
aboard flying airplanes and flew 
over his shoulder, across which 
savage rainstorms played for a 
hundred years Without Cease. 

Those that were converted be- 
came More Extreme than their 
brethren older in the faith across 
the other side of the world. No 
sooner had the American congre- 
gations united with ours than 
they broke away on a point of 
doctrine at the Council of Dead 
Tench (322). This date marks 
the beginning of the Catholic 
Universal Sacrificial Church. We 
of the Orthodox persuasion did 
not enjoy, in those distant days, 
the harmony with our American 
brothers that we do now. 

The doctrinal point on which 
the churches split apart was, as 



is well known, the question of 
whether humanity should wear 
clothes that imitated the metallic 
sheen of the Huge God. It was 
claimed that this was setting up 
man in God’s Image; but it was 
a calculated slur on the Orth- 
odox Universal priests, who wore 
plastic or metal garments in hon- 
or of their maker. 

This developed into the Sec- 
ond Great Heresy. As this long 
and confused period has been 
aptly dealt with elsewhere, we 
may pass over it lightly here, 
mentioning merely that the quar- 
rel reached its climax in the Sec- 
ond Crusade, which the American 
Catholic Universals launched 
against us in 450. Because they 
still had a large preponderance of 
machines they were able to force 
their point, to sack various mon- 
asteries along the edge of the 
Sacred Sea, to defile our women 
and to retire home in glory. 

Since that time, everyone in 
the world has worn only gar- 
ments of wool or fur. All who 
opposed this enlightened act were 
destroyed. 

It would be wrong to empha- 
size too much the struggles of 
the past. All this while, the ma- 
jority of people were peacefully 
about their worship, being sac- 
rificed regularly, and praying 
every sunset and sunrise (when- 
ever they might occur) that the 
Huge God would leave our 



HERESIES OF THE HUGE GOD 



41 



world, since we were not worthy 
of him. 

The Second Crusade left a trail 
of troubles in its wake. The next 
fifty years were, on the whole, 
not happy ones. The American 
armies returned home to find 
that the heavy pressure upon 
their western seaboard had op- 
ened up a number of volcanoes 
along their biggest mountain 
range, the Rockies. Their coun- 
try was covered in fire and lava, 
and their air filled with stink- 
ing ash. 

Rightly, they accepted this as 
a sign that their conduct left 
much to be desired in the eyes 
of the Huge God (for though it 
has never been proved that he 
has eyes, he surely Sees Us). 
Since the rest of the world hacf 
not been Visited with punish- 
ment on quite this scale, they 
correctly divined that their sin 
was that they still clung to tech- 
nology and to the weapons of 
technology which was against the 
wishes of God. 

With their faith strong within 
them, every last instrument of 
science, from the Nuclears to the 
Canopeners, was destroyed, and 
a hundred thousand virgins of 
the persuasion were dropped into 
suitable volcanoes as propitia- 
tion. All who opposed these en- 
lightened acts were destroyed, 
and some were even ceremonial- 
ly eaten. 



ITUe of the Orthodox Universal 
* ' faith applauded our broth- 
ers’ whole-hearted action. Yet 
we could not be sure they had 
purged themselves enough. Now 
that they owned no weapons and 
we still had some, it was clear we 
could help them in their purga- 
tion. Accordingly, a mighty ar- 
mada of one hundred and sixty- 
six wooden ships sailed across to 
America, to help them suffer for 
the faith — and incidentally to 
get back some of our loot. This 
was the Third Crusade of 482, 
under Jon the Chubby. 

While the two opposed armies 
were engaged in battle outside 
New York, the Second Shift took 
place. It lasted only a matter of 
five minutes. 

In that time, the Huge God 
turned to his left flank, crawled 
across the Atlantic as if it were 
a puddle, moved over Africa, 
and came to rest in the south 
Indian Ocean, demolishing Mad- 
agascar with one rear foot. Night 
fell Everywhere on earth. 

When dawn came, there could 
hardly have been a single man 
who did not believe in the power 
and wisdom of the Huge God, to 
whose name belongs all Terror 
and Might. Unhappily, among 
those who were unable to believe 
were the contesting armies who 
were one and all swept under a 
Wave of Earth and Rock as the 
God passed.

GALAXY 



In the ensuing chaos, only one 
note of sanity prevailed — the san- 
ity of the Church. The Church 
established as the Third Great 
Heresy the idea that any ma- 
chines were permissible to man 
against the wishes of God. There 
was some doctrinal squabble as 
to whether books counted as ma- 
chines. It was decided they did, 
just to be on the safe side. From 
then on, all men were free to do 
nothing but labor in the fields 
and worship, and pray to the 
Huge God to remove himself to 
a world more worthy of his 
might. At the same time, the rate 
of sacrifices was stepped up, and 
the Slow-Burning Method was 
introduced (499). 

Now followed the great Peace, 
which lasted till 900. In all this 
time, the Huge God never 
moved ; it has been truly said that 
the centuries are but seconds in 
his sight. Perhaps mankind has 
never known such a long peace, 
four hundred years of it — a peace 
that existed in his heart if not 
outside it, because the world was 
naturally in Some Disorder. The 
great force of tire Huge God’s 
progress halfway across the 
world had altered the progression 
of day and night to a consider- 
able extent. Some legends claim 
that before the Second Shift, the 
sun used to rise in the east and 
set in the west — the opposite of 
today’s natural order. 



Gradually, this peaceful period 
saw some re-establishment of or- 
der to the seasons, and some 
cessation of the floods, showers 
of blood, hailstorms, earth- 
quakes, deluges of icicles, appari- 
tions of comets, volcanic erup- 
tions, miasmic fogs, destructive 
winds, blights, plagues of wolves 
and dragons, tidal waves, year- 
long thunder storms, lashing 
rains and sundry other scourges 
of which the scriptures of this 
period speak so eloquently. The 
Fathers of the Church, retiring 
to the comparative safety of the 
inland seas and sunny meadows 
of Gobiland in Mongolia, estab- 
lished a new orthodoxy well cal- 
culated in its rigor of prayer and 
human burnt-offering to invite 
the Huge God to leave our poor 
wretched world for a better and 
more substantial one. 

So the story comes to the pres- 
ent — to the year 900, only a dec- 
ade past as your scribe writes. 
In that year, the Huge God left 
our earth! 

O ecall, if you will, that the 
^ First Departure in 89 lasted 
only twenty months. Yet the 
Huge God has been gone from 
us already half that number of 
years! We need him Back. We 
cannot live without him, as we 
should have realized Long Ago 
had we not blasphemed in our 
hearts!

On his going, he propelled our 
humble globe on such a course 
that we are doomed to deepest 
winter all the year; the sun is 
far away and shrunken; the seas 
Freeze half the year; icebergs 
march across our fields; at mid- 
day, it is too dark to read with- 
out a rush light; nothing will 
grow. Woe is us! 

Yet we deserve everything we 
get. This is a just punishment, 
for throughout all the centuries 
of our epoch, when our kind was 
so relatively happy and undis- 
turbed, we prayed like fools that 
the Huge God would leave us. 
And now he has. 

I ask all the Elders Elect of 
the Council to brand those pray- 
ers as the Fourth and Greatest 
Heresy, and to declare that 
henceforth all men’s efforts be 
completely devoted to calling on 
the Huge God to return to us at 
once. 

I ask also that the sacrifice 
rate be stepped up again. It is 
useless to skimp things just be- 
cause we are running out of 
women. 

I ask also that a Fourth Cru- 
sade be launched — fast, before 
the air starts to freeze in our nos- 
trils!

B¥ WILLY LEY 



SCHEHERAZADE’S 

ISLAND 

A Sunday afternoon during 
which periods of heavy 
downpour and mere rain chased 
one another through the hours 
until darkness made me resolve 
to straighten out my library. 
This is a recurring but non- 
periodic resolution that invari- 



45 



ably miscarries, though the rea- 
sons are not always the same. 
This time it miscarried because 
I came across a book I had never 
really read : Robert Drury’s Jour- 
nal, “printed for Tho. Won-all, 
at Judge Coke’s Head, near the 
Temple-Exchange Coffee-House 
in Fleet Street, London,” in 
1728. 

Robert Drury, a shipwrecked 
British sailor, had been in Mada- 
gascar as a captive for fifteen 
years, until rescued by Capt. 
William Mackett. His “journal” 
was not really what the name 
implies, because it was written 
by him from memory after his 
return “on eight Quires in Folio, 
each of near an hundred Pages”, 
that had to be “contracted” by 
an editor. 

Madagascar is not “the land of 
the man-eating tree” since there 
is no such thing. But it is the 
home of impressive plants and 
of many very interesting animals, 
and I was curious what an ob- 
viously intelligent but scientific- 
ally illiterate man had to say 
about them. In that respect the 
book was a disappointment, for 
Drury speaks only of cattle, 
sheep, goats and pigs — “eaten 
only be the very Poor” — and 
the only zoological item is a 
statement that the large “ser- 
pent” is without venom. He does 
apologize at one point, saying 
that a “person of Curiosity” 



might have made many observa- 
tions but that he did not, partly 
because he was too young (about 
16 when he got there) and part- 
ly because his status as a slave 
forced him to think of day-to- 
day things most of the time. 

But — and this is what hap- 
pens when you clean up your 
library — I also came across 
another volume, namely No. 17 
of the Memoires de T Academie 
Malgache, printed in 1934 and 
written by Professor C. Larnber- 
ton, dealing with an especially 
interesting aspect of the fauna of 
Madagascar, namely its “sub- 
fossil” animals. The word “sub- 
fossil” is one of those terms that 
is difficult to explain. It refers 
to bones that are not yet old 
enough to have become trye fos- 
sils. But that does not say any- 
thing definite about their age. 
Depending on climate, area and 
circumstances, “sub-fossil” might 
mean as little as 500 years or as 
much as 5000 years and even 
more. In the case of the sub-fos- 
sil bones of Madagascar the age 
limits are probably 500 years at 
one end and 2000 years at the 
other. One important fact should 
be mentioned right now: there 
are no human remains among 
these bones. 

1\ /T adagascar is one of the large 
islands on our globe. It is 
about 1000 miles long with an

average width of 250 miles (360 
miles at the widest point) and 
an area of 227,760 square miles. 

It could have been discovered 
about the year 595 B.C. when a 
party of Phoenicians in the pay 
of the Egyptian ruler Necho 
sailed south along the east coast 
of Africa, rounded the southern 
tip of the continent and reached 
Egypt again by sailing through 
the Pillars of Hercules (Strait 
of Gibraltar) into the Mediter- 
ranean. But the Phoenicians, like 
all the sailors of antiquity, sailed 
within the sight of land if at all. 
possible and therefore passed the 
250-mile wide Mozambique 
Channel that separates Mada- 
gascar from the African continent 
without ever guessing that there 
was land to their left. 

At that time Madagascar was, 
in all probability, still uninhab- 
ited by men. The dates of the 
first discovery and of the first 
settlements are not known. Most 
of the later inhabitants were of 
Malayo-Polynesian stock. And 
there were a few early Arab set- 
tlements; the first Westerner to 
see the island was the Portuguese 
captain Diego Diaz on August 
10, 1500 A.D. 

Whatever was known about 
Madagascar prior to 1500 must 
have come from Arab sources, in- 
cluding the first reference to the 
island in a western book, namely 
the travel book of Marco Polo 



which was written, or rather dic- 
tated, in 1298. He had not been 
been there himself and the de- 
pendence on Arab sources is 
shown by the statement that “the 
inhabitants are Saracens, or fol- 
lowers of the law of Mohammed.” 
The numerous other inhabitants 
are not mentioned at all. While 
the location and the size of the 
island are given correctly, every- 
thing else Marco Polo says about 
Madagascar is wrong. What he 
does say — namely that elephants 
abound, that wild boars, giraffes 
and asses are numerous — applies 
to the African mainland on the 
other side of the channel. Pre- 
sumably his Arabs had told him 
about life on their far southern 
outposts without being too spec- 
ific of what was where. 

As a source for the early his- 
tory of Madagascar, Marco Po- 
lo’s book is without value, but this 
chapter contains the first western 
mention of the “rukh” (the Roc 
of the Arabian Nights ) as a bird 
that flies to Madagascar “from 
the southern regions” at a cer- 
tain season. “Persons who have 
seen this bird assert that when 
the wings are spread, they meas- 
ure sixteen paces in extent, from 
point to point; and that the 
feathers are eight paces in length, 
and thick in proportion.” Marco 
Polo then went on to say that 
the Great Khan, being very cur- 
ious about such a huge bird, sent

messengers to the island under a 
pretext. When the messengers re- 
turned they brought with them a 
feather of the rukh, “positively 
affirmed to have measured 90 
spans, and the quill part to have 
been two palms in circumfer- 
ence.” 

It is now generally believed 
that the “feather” brought to the 
Great Khan was actually the 
frond of a Raphia palm. When 
dry these fronds do look like 
enormous bird feathers, though 
their size is only about half of 
what the report says. The some- 
what surprising point is that 
Marco Polo, a merchant used to 
weights and measures, made no 
effort to reconcile the different 
figures he had heard about. If we 
take a “pace” to be about three 
feet, then the eight paces of the 
first story are about 25 feet, 
while the 90 spans of the “fea- 
ther” are about 60 feet. 

To western readers the Roc is 
known from the tales of Scheher- 
azade only, and it would be nice 
if it were possible to establish a 
date for them. Unfortunately this 
can not be done because they 
were not collected into a whole 
until quite late, during the fif- 
teenth century of our calendar. 
The earliest mention of the ex- 
istence of these tales is in Mea- 
dows of Gold and Mines of Gems 
by Abu-al-Hasan Ali al-Mas’udi 
who died in 956 A.D. The learn- 



ed al-Mas’udi had no use for 
them, he called them the Book 
of the Thousand Khurafas 
(“whoppers”) and just to main- 
tain the reputation of the Arabs 
he said that they were transla- 
tions from the Persian and the 
Greek. It was not so much the 
foreign origin of the tales that 
annoyed al-Mas’udi; as a strict 
Mohammedan he was against 
any kind of fiction. Even now 
some of the stricter sects of the 
Mohammedans are said to con- 
demn all books that are not 
either religious of strictly factual, 
such as medical works. The 
chance mention of the tales is 
even less helpful since nobody 
has the faintest idea of whether 
the tales referred to by al- 
Mas’udi are the ones we know or 
whether he had another set of 
tales in mind. 

In the Arabian Nights the Roc 
appears in Sindbad’s second voy- 
age, and no location is given, ex- 
cept that it was an island in a 
tropical climate. Because of Mar- 
co Polo’s remarks Sinbad’s is- 
land was identified with Mada- 
gascar by later commentators. Of 
course nobody took either Marco 
Polo’s Arab sources or the un- 
known compiler of the tales of 
Sindbad seriously; but why Mad- 
agascar? There was no answer to 
that question. But as time went 
on Madagascar continued to con- 
tribute stories of large birds.

probably the earliest one in 
modern times is a short re- 
mark in the Histoire de la 
Grande Isle de Madagascar, pub- 
lished in 1658 by the French col- 
onizer Admiral Etienne de Fla- 
court, who lived on Madagascar 
for some time and also compiled 
a dictionary of the Malagassy 
language. He just said that there 
was a very large bird living in 
the loneliest places of the island 
and laying eggs like an ostrich 
egg. The natives, he added, call 
this bird vouroupatra, but since 
the native word for bird is voron 
either the admiral or his printer 
misspelled at least one letter. 
Etienne de Flacourt’s remark 
was disregarded. Nobody was too 
much interested in a large bird 
that did not seem to interfere 
with any human activity. 

During the decade from 1830 
to 1840 Europeans travelling to 
the island — most of them French- 
men — suddenly came across en- 
ormous egg shells. One saw a 
half shell being used as a bowl. 
He tried to buy it, but the na- 
tives needed it too badly and 
would not sell. A few years later, 
in 1840, a traveller named Gou- 
dot found remains of large eggs 
and took them with him to Paris. 
At about the same time a French 
merchant named Dumarele saw 
a nearly whole egg. He later told 
the story to the ship’s doctor of 
H.M.S. Geyser, one John Joliffe, 




who entered it in his private 
journal as follows: 

Leven, on the north-west of the 
egg, the production of an un- 
“M. Dumarele casually men- 
tioned . that he saw at Port 
island, the shell of an enormous 
known bird inhabiting the wilds 
of the country, which held the 
almost incredible quantity of 
thirteen wine quart bottles of 
fluid!!!, he having himself care- 
fully measured the quantity. It 
was of the colour and appear- 
ance of an ostrich egg, and the 
substance of the shell was about 
the thickness of a Spanish dol- 
lar, and very hard in texture. It 
was brought on deck by the na- 
tives to be filled with rum, 
having a tolerably large hole at 
one end, through which the 
contents of the egg had been 
extracted, and which served as 
the mouth of the vessel. M. 
Dumarele offered to purchase 
the egg from the natives, but 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



49 



they declined selling it, stating 
that it belonged to their chief, 
and that they could not dispose 
of it without his permission. 
The natives said the egg was 
found in the jungle and ob- 
served that such eggs were 
very very rarely met with, and 
that the bird which produces 
them is still more rarely seen.” 

Thus doctor Joliffe in 1848. 
He did not doubt Dumarele’s 
word and admitted that there 
might be such eggs, but thought 
it equally possible that Dumarele 
had been “imposed upon by the 
roguery of the natives.” 

In London they were less skep- 
tical because in 1839 Sir Richard 
Owen had received a large bone 
from New Zealand which he 
found to be the leg bone of a 
very large ostrich-like bird, the 
first of the moas to become 
known. If New Zealand had 
been inhabited by enormous 
birds, why not Madagascar? Its 
existence became “official” in 
1851 when the French merchant 
Captain Abadie found three eggs 
and some bone fragments on the 
southwest coast of the island and 
brought them to the Adademie 
des Sciences in Paris. The largest 
of the eggs measured about 15)4 
by 12 j /2 inches, indicating a 
capacity equal to half a dozen 
ostrich eggs or nearly 150 hen’s 
eggs. The bones hinted at an os- 
trich-like bird, but larger. In or- 

50 



der to have a handy and interna- 
tional label for the still poorly 
known big bird from Madagas- 
car, the French naturalist Isidore 
Geoffroy St. Hilaire named it 
Aepyornis, from the Greek words 
1 aipys (“high” or “tall”) and ornis 
(“bird”), adding maximus as a 
generic name. This would trans- 
late as “the tallest of the tall 
birds” but this was a mistake. 
Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire as- 
sumed twice the dimensions of 
the living ostrich, making Aepy- 
omis 16 feet tall; actually, as we 
now know, the bird carried its 
head only about ten feet above 
the ground. Some of the New 
Zealand moas were taller (and 
some more recently discovered 
South American and African 
forms may have been taller still), 
but Aepyornis was probably the 
most massive bird that ever 
lived : a full grown specimen may 
have weighed close to 1000 
pounds. 

Ponds and swamps later yield- 
ed bones of Aepyornis in a per- 
fect state of preservation. There 
were three species of Aepyornis. 
Aepyornis hildebrandtii was 
hardly larger than an African os- 
trich, though more massive. The 
second, Aepyornis medius was 
bigger and Aepyornis maximus, 
the largest. 



TTverybody, after the gigantic 
u *-- y eggs of Aepyornis with their 



GALAXY 



2 / gallon capacity had been def- 
initely established, was agreed 
that the egg of the Roc had been 
discovered. They were enormous 
in size and they were found pre- 
cisely where Marco Polo’s Arab 
sources said: namely on Mada- 
gascar. But this identification left 
two questions open. One was the 
more scientific one of when 
Aepyornis became extinct, the 
other wondered about the state- 
ment that the Roc was supposed 
to have looked like an eagle; 
Aepyornis certainly did not look 
that way. 

As regards the time of its ex- 
tinction we can probably accept 
Etienne de Flacourt’s statement 
that they were still alive in 1650, 
even though the admiral had not 
seen them himself. Remember 
that the French merchant Dum- 
arele was also told — in about 
1840 — that the birds could still 
be seen, though very rarely. One 
of the reasons why this does not 
sound incredible is the way Du- 
marele talked about the egg as if 
it had been a fresh egg that had 
been emptied of its natural con- 
tents by the native for the pur- 
pose of making a large jug. It 
is possible, therefore, that the 
last survivors of the Aepyornis 
tribe still existed a little over a 
century ago. Since then the 
swampy forests inhabited by the 
birds seem to have been drained 
or disappeared for natural rea-

sons. At any event the chance of 
still discovering survivors is so 
close to zero that one doesn’t 
have to think about it. 

Now for the other question: if 
the egg of the Roc was the egg of 
Aepyornis, how come the fully 
grown bird was described as hav- 
ing the shape of an eagle, or at 
least a flying bird? The early 
Arabs that had established settle- 
ments or trading posts on Mada- 
gascar must have seen them 
from time to time, though prob- 
ably only from a distance be- 
cause the Arab settlements were 
at the coast while the birds lived 
inland. 

I am not digressing if I speak 
about the feathers for a moment. 

, The surviving types of such 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



51 



birds, from the New Zealand 
kiwi to the South American rhea, 
usually have hair-like feathers. 
The decorative “plumes” of the 
African ostrich are an exception. 
It is very likely, therefore, that 
the large birds of Madagascar al- 
so had hair-like feathers, produc- 
ing an egg-shaped outline of the 
body, with a neck and two legs 
sticking out. Unfortunately we 
don’t know whether the neck was 
naked or covered with feathers. 

At any event the outline of 
Aepyomis, stalking around in a 
shallow lake with its head down 
looking for food might well have 
reminded the Arabs of a chick. 
But if these large birds, not too 
clearly seen, were chicks, then 
the “full grown” bird would have 
to have about the dimensions of 
the Roc with an assumed wing- 
spread of about 50 feet. One did 
not have to actually see the full 
grown bird. The sight of its mon- 
strous “chicks” was enough to 
start the story. 

r T''he fauna of Madagascar must 
have undergone quite consid- 
erable changes during the last 
thousand years. A thousand 
years ago all three species of 
Aepyornis certainly were still 
alive and so was Mullerornis, a 
large flightless bird related to 
the cassowary, of about the same 
dimensions as today’s ostrich. A 
large tortoise, named Testudo 



grandidieri, must have been 
rather common a thousand years 
ago. Its carapace measured more 
than three feet in length and 
since all large land tortoises are 
edible the reason for the disap- 
pearance of this type does not 
need a natural catastrophe to be 
explained. In fact, it may not 
have disappeared completely. 
Every once in a while there is a 
story that is best and most easily 
explained by such a large and 
now rare tortoise. The current 
crocodile is identical with that of 
Africa, though somewhat smaller; 
but a larger form, called Croc- 
odylus robustus, with a skull 2J4 
feet in length, is now extinct. The 
hippopotamus of Madagascar 
does not seem to have been men- 
tioned by anybody — unless it 
went under the. mistaken name 
of giant hog — but sub-fossil 
bones indicate that the animal 
was a good deal smaller than the 
living African version. 

But the typical animals of 
Madagascar are* the lemurs, 
ranging in size from that of a 
rat to a very large cat. They are 
primates like monkeys, apes and 
people, but they are at the bot- 
tom of the primate hierarchy. 
Most are nocturnal, producing 
plaintive moans and cries and 
having large eyes that glow 
weirdly when a beam of light 
strikes them. That they struck 
observers, even professional zo-

ologists, as weird is indicated 
even by their scientific name, for 
“lemurs” is derived from the 
Latin lemures, which meant the 
shades of the dead, or ghosts. 

The size range mentioned ap- 
plies to the living forms only. 
There were others that were larg- 
er, and I feel quite sure that one 
of them provided Scheherazade 
with another ingredient for many 
of her tales: the afreets. 



/Classical writers of the Arab 
^ world have occasionally 
tried to classify the non-material 
beings of their mythology, the 
djinns, ghouls, afreets and so 
forth, the question being whether 
they are of Adam’s seed or not. 
It is all quite unclear. The angels 
are taken to be a special creation 
of Allah; the others are permit- 
ted to exist. But the authors 
seem to have been uncertain not 
only in their ideas but in their 
terminology as well and since 
this is not my field I am going 
to use a sentence often used by 
al-Mas’udi when he was called 
upon to make a decision. He 
would then write: “some say this, 
some say that, God knows best.” 
But in general the djinns seem 
to be personified dust swirls that 
materialize into something 
dreadful. The afreets give the 
impression of being somewhat 
more substantial, “with teeth like 
stones, with eyes like lamps.” 

Of course the afreets were 
pure imagination. There was 
nothing in nature that would 
suggest such a being. There 
wasn’t, that is, until scientists be- 
gan to find sub-fossil bones, 
mainly in the southern part of 
Madagascar. 

Then the Transactions of the 
Royal Society of London re- 
ceived a paper by Forsyth Major 
entitled: “On Megaladapis mad- 
agascariensis, an extinct gigantic

4. Skull of Mcgalttdapis cdwardsi. 

Lemuroid from Madagascar.” 
This was in 1894; ten years later 
there was definite evidence that 
this form had been the smallest 
of three species. The largest, 
called Megaladapis Edwaidsi, 
was first described by Dr. Lud- 
wig Lorenz von Liburnau in the 
publications of the Imperial 
Academy of Science in Vienna 
(1905). 

The age of the large now-ex- 
tinct lemuroids is once more 
“sub-fossil”; they were certain- 
ly still alive at the time Julius 
Caesar reformed the calendar. 

54 



And a passage in Etienne de 
Flacourt’s book, talking about 
an animal with the wonderful 
name of tratratratra — “as big as 
a two -year-old calf, with a round 
head and a man’s face: the fore- 
feet like an ape’s and the hind- 
feet also like an ape’s, with frizzy 
hair and a short tail” — must re- 
fer to one of the large lemuroids, 
though the specific form may 
not be known yet to science. 

Professor Lamberton, who has 
made a tentative reconstruction, 
showed the Megaladapis in a 
four-footed position, but he had 
to say that a good deal of his re- 
construction is hypothetical. One 
of the unknown factors is the 
number of vertebrae in the spinal 
column. The skull is well known, 
as are the hands and feet, but 
there seems to be no specimen 
that was found complete and 
some mistakes are therefore pos- 
sible. But even if (which is not 
certain yet) Megaladapis often 
walked on all fours, a lemuroid is 
likely to straighten out on oc- 
casion, even if it might have had 
to hold on to a tree trunk or 
tree branch to do so. 

In an upright position even the 
smallest species of Megaladapis 
was taller than a man. Admiral 
de Flacourt said that his tratra- 
tratra is as afraid of people as 
people are of it. But its appear- 
ance was not trust-inspiring and 
just imagine the feelings of an 

GALAXY 



Arab (or any other stranger to 
Madagascar) of the year 800, 
say, when he ran into a Megalad- 
apis at night. There it stood, 
vaguely man-like in shape when 
upright, with man-like hands, 
black or at least dark in color, 
with large fangs hanging out of 
its mouth and its eyes gleaming 
in the light of the man’s torch. 

“With teeth like rocks and eyes 
shining like lamps . .” Since 



each was afraid of the other 
there was mutual flight, but one 
cannot blame the man for as- 
suming that he had “escaped”. 
He probably thanked Allah for 
his delivery and then went to his 
fellow traders to tell what he 
had seen — and now the concept 
of the afreet that may have ex- 
isted before acquired a bodily 
shape.

When Jack Vance won his Hugo for The Dragon Masters, it was 
for a story which had originally appeared in Galaxy. Over the years, 
many of Jack's best-loved stories have been in this magazine — most 
recently The Last Castle in our April issue — and it is our pleasure to 
report that the end is not yet in sight. Next issue has his newest novel. 
In it he continues the vendetta of a man bred for vengeance against 
the Demon Princes who rule the outlaw reaches of the Galaxy. It's 
called The Palace of Love — and love, you will see, can be a terribly 
deadly weapon! 

Anne McCaffrey joins us for the first time next issue, too, with 
The Ship Who Killed. Larry Niven has a novelette of Mars (with craters!) 
and the men who will explore it, called How the Heroes Die. And we'll 
have Willy Ley and Algis Budrys, of course, with their regular columns, 
and as many other stories as we can squeeze in. 

One of which will, we hope, be the Arthur C. Clarke A Recursion 
in Metastories which we announced some months ago. To those who 
have been waiting patiently, our apologies — - but you know it isn't 
easy to find a spot for what its author calls the longest story ever writ- 
ten! (In spite of the fact that it actually runs something under a thousand 
words. )

Illustrated by MORROW 



The city was packed with people — 
and if was doomed fo destruction! 



56 






I 

I t was late in the summer of 
2794 that Biond Smith — 
who was and would remain 
chief of the Disaster Plans 
Board until the moment he al- 
lowed a disaster to get away 
from him — called Jothen Kent 
home from an Australian vaca- 
tion by announcing the end of 
the world. 

Jothen, who had been bub- 
bling away contentedly in a 
scuba rig off Triton Reef, had 
waited eight years for that va- 
cation, but as senior water-en- 
gineer of a standby city — one 
that stood empty until some 
threatened part of the world’s 
ten thousand billion people 
had to be decanted into it — he 
knew all along that he was sub- 
ject to recall, by storm, by 
earthquake, by famine or by 



57 



something he had not been 
trained to imagine. On the oth- 
er hand, he did not see what 
good a stand-by city would be 
at the end of the world, so he 
was a little resentful at the in- 
terruption. 

One look at Biond, however, 
and he was worried. World Di- 
rectors, it was axiomatic, never 
sounded scared. But Biond was 
at best nervous and distracted. 
And small wonder. As the story 
came out of him in small blurts 
and pieces of sentences, it be- 
gan to appear to Jothen that he 
did have a real block-buster on 
his hands. 

“Or a planetbuster,” Biond 
agreed. “This is going to be a 
fearful business, Jothen. I sup- 
pose it was inevitable sooner or 
later, but still and all we’ve 
never been really prepared for 
it. We wouldn’t have been . 
Damn, I’d better tell you what 
I’m talking about.” 

“It wouldn’t hurt,” Jothen 
said, watching Biond worriedly. 

“Well, it’s like this. We’re go- 
ing to be hit by a meteor. One 
hell of a meteor — effective di- 
ameter more than a mile.” 

“That doesn’t sound very 
big.” 

“My God Jothen! There’s 
been nothing like it since the 
Siberian meteorite, eight cen- 
turies back, and that was prob- 
ably rather small. Really we’ve 



been very lucky to have gotten 
away without a major hit for so 
long. It’s going to fall in Can- 
ada, and there will be nothing 
left of the Northwest after that. 
Nothing!” 

“From a bolide only a mile 
across? It must be coming in 
fast — but, Biond, I don’t have 
any expertise in this area. What 
do we know about this thing?” 

T>iond picked up a stylus and 
began doodling nervously. 
“A fair question. Its name is 
Flavia, after the wife of the as- 
tronomer who discovered it, 
long ago. It was one of those 
odd little asteroids that used to 
scare people by coming within 
half a million miles of the Earth 
every so often and then got lost 
before anybody’d worked out its 
orbit. Physically, it’s a granite 
tetrahedron about fourteen 
miles along the long axis and 
about eight miles in diameter 
at the waist. We think it’s a 
crustal fragment of Neferetete 
II, the big asteroidal protoplan- 
et of which Ceres was probably 
a moon.” 

Biond threw the stylus down 
and stared belligerantly at 
Jothen. “But not one word of 
this stuff does us any good. We 
might as well not know it at 
all.” 

“I’m not so sure,” Jothen said 
with careful calmness. “You 



58 



GALAXY 



said that it’s a mile across — 
and then, you said it’s eight 
miles across, the short way. Are 
you trying to break it up, 
Biond?” 

“God knows we’re trying to 
break it up,” Biond said, with 
bitter energy. “We thought we 
might bomb it, but when we 
thought about what might hap- 
pen when a radioactive cloud 
three hundred miles in diame- 
ter hit us, we gave up that idea. 
Instead, we have men drilling 
the rock down to the bottom 
and planting charges in it, for a 
start — three of them killed al- 
ready — in the hope of frag- 
menting it, spreading it out. 
And I think we can us lasers on 
one side of it, to boil off some 
of it and deflect it a little by. 
vapor pressure. 

“But when it hits, Jothen, 
when it hits, it’s going to be 
about a mile in diameter all 
the same. And do you know 
what that means, Jothen? Do 
you know what’s going to be- 
come of our history-long effort 
to accommodate all our people? 
It will all come to nothing, 
Jothen. Nothing.” 

“It’ll be bad, I don’t doubt 
that. But why that bad?” 

“I have to exaggerate,” Biond 
admitted, “otherwise I can’t 
hope not to be surprised. Phys- 
ically, only central Canada and 
the Great Lakes area are likely 



to suffer direct shock. But that 
means the destruction of about 
fifty moderate-sized cities and 
maybe ten large ones. I can see 
very little hope of saving the 
Twin Cities complex, for in- 
stance, even though a lot of it 
will probably be left standing; 
communications and supplies 
are going to be knocked out for 
a long time. Sheer structural 
damage is only the beginning of 
the story. That’s why I’m going 
to need your city right away 
and all the other stand-by cities 
in the Middle West.” 

“Obviously,” Jothen said. 
“You’ll have to evacuate the 
Twin Cities, and so on.” 

“Oh, yes, but it’s worse than 
that, Jothen — much worse. 
We’re also going to have to 
evacuate the Chicago group.” 
“It can’t be done!” 

“My sentiments exactly. How- 
ever, there it is. Any impedi- 
ments in your town? Just what 
shape is Gitler in, anyhow?” 
“Loaded,” Jothen said with a 
sudden shock of realization. 
“The Jones Convention is still 
going on there — or should be — 
if nothing’s disbanded it ahead 
of schedule, while I was in Aus- 
tralia.” 

“No, not that I’ve heard,” 
Biond said. “A relatively small 
family convention, I seem to re- 
call, though. That’s to our ad- 
vantage.”

“Yes, I think I can get them 
all out of town in no more than 
three weeks.” 

“One week,” Biond said. 
“Biond, that really is impos- 
sible. Sure it’s a small family — 
but there must be a million of 
them in Gitler, and my staff is 
small." 

“One week,” Biond said ston- 
ily. “Get ’em out. By the end of 
three weeks, I’ll be well started 
moving in refugees from Chi- 
cago. But I don’t want any of 
the Joneses trampled in the 
rush, either. Get on it, Jothen. 
Our friend Flavia is on her way 
— and she won’t wait.” 

A torrent of faces poured 
*■ down the penstock of Gor- 
ing Boulevard distorted with 
roars of almost religious joy and 
capped with funny hats. From 
a glastic-clad overlook just un- 
der the roof of the street, 
Jothen tried to keep his mind 
on his job, but failed miserably. 
He had never before seen so 
many people in all his life, and 
he did not know whether to be 
fascinated or terrified. 

Like most of the world’s 
thousands of small towns, the 
leaf -shaped, half-buried sprawl 
of Gitler, Mo., had been de- 
signed to hold ten million 
people comfortably, but until 
the Jones Convention it had 
never been used. Its echoing, 

60 



dustless emptiness would have 
seemed oppressive to the ordi- 
nary citizen of the pullulating 
world, but to Jothen, who had 
spent his working life in Gitler, 
it was normal. 

The handful of some ten 
thousand technicians who main- 
tained the stand-by city — pend- 
ing disaster — was simply swal- 
lowed up in the general deser- 
tion. They had their own self- 
sufficient village just under the 
city’s flyport, complete and 
static — for children had to leave 
when they came of age, so that 
Gitler would not build up an in- 
digenous population of its own 
— but on duty they almost nev- 
er saw each other in groups of 
more than two or three at a 
time. In the world at large, that 
much privacy, impossible ex- 
cept in one’s own apartment, 
would in fact have been a little 
frightening. 

But Jothen belonged to the 
world’s privileged class; he was 
not used to crowds. 

The Jones Convention went 
by him regardless, like an aval- 
anche. Plump boys plunking 
two-stringed kithera, wild-eyed 
old men charging through the 
air on super-charged auto- 
crutches, fat sterile women par- 
ading squeakily, talking animal- 
dolls with heads like babies and 
twitchingly animated grotesque 
family totems of all kinds — 



GALAXY 



many so tall that their idiot 
heads bumped along the roof of 
the boulevard — went by singing 
old synthetic songs in old for- 
gotten keys or clinging to dan- 
gerous floats blazoned UP 
YOUR JONES! or McDOBIE 
BRANCH FOREVER! and fol- 
lowed by complicated self- 
blowing kites, pennons and bal- 
loons in the shapes of crucifixes, 
germs, ancestors, birds, insects, 
hobbits, automobiles, reprints, 
guardian angels, clotheslines, 
codas, dragons, horses, taxes 
and other mythological mon- 
sters. 

“Funny, aren’t they?” Alva 
McGee said, behind Jothen’s 
back. 

“They scare me, Alva. What 
are we going to do with all these 
madmen?” 

/T cGee looked shrewdly at 
^ Jothen, but had nothing 
more to say for the moment; 
and Jothen realized suddenly 
that McGee was as big a puzzle 
to him as the Joneses. Finding 
the man assigned to him as an 
“administrative assistant” for 
the evacuation of the Joneses 
had been a surprise, and not en- 
tirely a welcome one, particu- 
larly after Jothen discovered 
that McGee’s qualifications for 
the job included the title of 
Mayor but did not include any 
special knowledge of the water 



system or any of the rest of the 
fine structure of Gitler. 

Even his title was baffling. 
No city had had a mayor or 
been otherwise independent of 
the over-riding ecology and ec- 
onomy of the over-ridden world, 
for nearly as many centuries as 
Jothen had fingers. Apparently, 
the presence of McGee repre- 
sented only some last-minute 
notion of Biond Smith’s that 
the stand-by city’s crew would 
need help with their paper 
work. 

It was a notion Jothen some- 
what resented, if it was correct. 
And whatever the answer to 
this puzzle, Jothen did not 
judge McGee capable of much 
help. His specific technical ig- 
norance simply added pedagogy 
to the press of Jothen’s other 
duties. That much, Jothen 
could manage to resent from 
scratch. 

“They’re not as mad as all 
that,” McGee said equably. 
“They’re noisy, but why not? — 
they’re having a good time. 
These family conventions are 
the citizens’ one big chance in 
a lifetime to cut loose and be- 
have almost as anti-socially as 
they could have every day, 
back in the Age of Waste.” 

Jothen groaned inwardly. 
McGee’s occasional fits of his- 
tory were already a cross to 
him. “It amazes me that Prime 



THE PIPER OF DIS 



61 




Center allows them at all — the 
Conventions, I mean,” he said. 

“Therapy, my boy, therapy. 
Besides, they give Transcorp a 
golden opportunity to process 
vacationers in blocs of a million 
or more at once, instead of one 
at a time. All perfectly ration- 
al.” 

Jothen pointed to the dolls 
and banners. “Those are ration- 
al?” 

“No, but they’re helpful,” 
McGee said, “if you know what 
to look for. All those things are 
just rags and tags of quasi-re- 
ligious traditions — a kind of 
Jungian-Gravesian substrate, 
decorated with vague memories 
of lesser cults. They imply all 



sorts of beliefs, not all of them 
quite extinct: reincarnation, 

racial memory, ancestor wor- 
ship, telepathy, historical fatal- 
ism, traditional supernatural- 
ism, momism — ” 

“ Whoa \ ” Jothen said desper- 
ately, quite unaware of the 
totem he was himself calling 
upon. 

“ — but the Joneses don’t 
know any of that. Lucky for us; 
if worse comes to worst, those 
things give us handles to man- 
ipulate them by.” 

“Good. Go manipulate them, 
Alva. I’ve got to check the 
water, the food, the power sup- 
plies from top to bottom and 
help the rest of the city’s oper-

ating crew make Gitler ready 
for occupancy. In the mean- 
time, I want the Joneses gotten 
out, by any form of transporta- 
tion you think convenient — the 
tubes would probably be best, 
but check Transcorp for advice. 
If you need any help, you can 
always call me; I’ll be aloft. All 
clear?” 

“As you command, effendi.” 
McGee made an exaggerated 
bow and started to leave. Then 
he thought better of it. He said, 
“Jothen, have you ever heard of 
a ward-heeler?” 

“No. What is it? Another 
Jones totem?” 

“Not precisely. See you later. 
I won’t call unless I have to.” 

He slipped away, quietly for 
so tubby and talkative a man. 
Below, the torrent of faces 
poured along as noisily as ever. 
Jothen was relieved to be able 
to get away from them both. 

Nevertheless, maybe McGee 
was going to have his uses after 
all. To do him justice, he had 
already eased Jothen’s worries 
a little, by reminding the har- 
ried engineer that some moder- 
ately large proportion of the 
Joneses — perhaps as many as 
twenty-five percent — probably 
did not need to be sent home at 
all. As members of a chiefly 
North American clan, that many 
probably lived within the areas 
due to be affected by the arriv- 



al of Fla via; and there would be 
no sense in shipping them back 
there. Since their specialties 
(those of them who were em- 
ployed) would no longer be 
needed at home, a lot of them 
would simply be exported right 
back to Gitler. It would take a 
little paper-and computer-work 
to identify this sub-group; but 
that was precisely the kind of 
thing that McGee was supposed 
to be good at, while the very 
idea itself had not occurred to 
Jothen. 

It had occurred, however, to 
one Fongavaro Jones. 

II 

I t was, in fact, the main reason 
why Fongavaro was at the 
moment hiding in one of the 
deepest service tunnels of Git- 
ler, feeling like a hunted man. 
He was not exactly hunted, yet, 
though he was looking forward 
to it. Instead, he was stalking a 
Rest Stop, just for the practice, 
since again he did not expect 
that there would be anyone in 
it. Not yet. 

Fongavaro was classified by 
UNOC as a communications 
systems specialist and hence, 
like Jothen, was one of those 
most fortunate of all citizens, a 
man with a job. But there tire 
resemblance ended. He looked 
rather more like an orangutan, 



64 



GALAXY 



a stocky, muscular man with 
long arms and large hands. In 
his native city — Tananarive, in 
Madagascar — he probably 
would have attracted no atten- 
tion; but in these dim, empty 
corridors he was a startling, per- 
haps even a fearsome figure. 

Of this he was well aware. 
Moreover, he was counting on 
it. 

If the usual Jones was as 
crazy as Jothen took them all 
to be — which was doubtful — 
then in this too, Fongavaro was 
a specialist. A great part of his 
life had been spent in the laby- 
rinthine service tunnels between 
the walls and under the floors 
of Tananarive, and he was 
thoroughly suited for it; in an 
earlier age, he might have been 
a spelunker. Beyond the aver- 
age UNOC citizen’s natural 
mild case of agoraphobia, he ac- 
tively enjoyed living at the bot- 
tom of a hole. The pleasure had 
been completely unconscious, 
simply because, until very re- 
cently, nothing had ever sug- 
gested any other way of living 
to him; he had been as adjusted 
as a mole. 

Then had come the journey to 
the Jones Convention — his first 
venture outside his own city, 
his first sight of the whole blue 
void of the sky, his first projec- 
tion into nothingness on a jet 
plane, his first direct encounter 

THE PIPER OF DIS 



with the boundless expanses of 
the sea and of the World For- 
est. Until it happened', he had 
thought of the trip only as a 
sort of longer, duller version of 
a tubeways jaunt from one 
Madagascan village to another. 
He had of course known that he 
would have to fly part of the 
way to Gitler, but he had never 
dreamed that it would be like 
that. 

He spent the whole air trip 
falling, falling helplessly out of 
his chair, desperately nauseat- 
ed, struggling not to look out 
the window, feeling stifled and 
trapped by his harness, fighting 
against the pills and injections 
they tried (successfully once or 
twice) to give him and, above 
all, raging at how his own body, 
his own ignorance, his own gull- 
ibility, his own manhood had 
betrayed him. 

The ordeal had been terrify- 
ing beyond belief — but worse 
than that, it had been humiliat- 
ing . totally humiliating. He 
had no intention of ever facing 
it again. 

The early recall of the Jones- 
es startled him a little, but did 
not dismay him. He had al- 
ready known precisely what he 
was going to do, as soon as he 
found that there was no official 
place in Gitler for him (which 
he had also expected). It was 
simplicity itself to hole up in 



65 



the service tunnels of Gitler, in 
a sector that had never been 
occupied by the Joneses or any- 
one else. The system was not 
identical with that of Tanana- 
rive, but the similarities were 
close enough for his purposes. 

r T''he Rest Stops, here as at 
home, were located at stra- 
tegic points throughout the net- 
work for the convenience of the 
maintainence staff, when they 
were on tours of inspection. Ex- 
cept that they had no windows, 
the Stops differed little from the 
average man’s apartment: eight 
rooms with complete living fa- 
cilities, including autoservers, 
so that staffmen could remain 
on tour for days at a time with- 
out having to return to the 
home technie village under the 
flyport. In a mostly empty 
stand-by city, no keys to the 
Stops were needed. 

As long as Fongavaro could 
stay clear of Gitler’s own crew, 
in short, he had it made. He 
could go underground and stay 
there. 

With the second general an- 
nouncement, however — that 
Gitler was soon to be occupied 
by a still greater horde than the 
Joneses, this time of refugees — 
he was less pleased. As was us- 
ual procedure every day and 
around the clock in any work- 
ing, occupied city, two-and 

66 



three-man teams would now be 
fanning out through the tunnels 
to check the utilities, and the 
Rest Stops would be needed. 
From now on, Fongavaro knew, 
he would have a tough time re- 
maining undiscovered. 

All the same, he was never 
going to go back to Tananarive 
— not for Jothen Kent, nor for 
UNOC, not for White Mother 
Jones herself. To prevent that, 
any alternative was thinkable. 

The next Rest Stop was be- 
fore him at the end of the cor- 
ridor, its closed iris door look- 
ing as cozy as the entrance to 
a burrow. He stopped just 
around the bend and listened. 
No, there was nobody inside — 
the little green telltales showed 
that — but nevertheless he 
thought he had heard a move- 
ment. 

There it was again. Footsteps 
— one set of them. 

Somebody was behind him. 
The steps were confident, un- 
hurried and not at all furtive. 
Fongavaro did not think that 
he was being stalked. It was 
probably just a service man. 
But from here on, the corridor 
was a blind alley. 

All right, let him come on. 
Fongavaro glided silently 
through the Rest Stop door, 
which irised shut as silently 
behind him. The telltale, of 
course, turned yellow; but that

couldn’t be prevented — and be- 
sides, the newcomer would 
probably welcome the idea of 
company. He was going to get 
it. 

Any alternative was think- 
able 

N ot much more than three 
million miles away, Biond 
Smith’s spoilage crew toiled 
clumsily in their vacuum suits, 
chewing steadily in Flavia’s vit- 
als with prolapse drills. They 
had less than two weeks left to 
break up the asteroid, before 
the lasers would focus on her 
remaining mass and turn her in- 
to a lopsided sunlet; but thus 
far, even with the loss of three 
lives, they had not succeeded 
in doing much more to her than 
spoiling her shape. 

An alarm sounded in their 
helmets, and the drilling stop- 
ped. It was time for another 
blast on tire Earthward side of 
the planetoid. Inevitably, some 
of the resulting pieces would 
take off for Earth a good deal 
faster than Flavia herself was 
already travelling, but that 
would just have to be borne, 
since it would concomitantly 
slow as well as lighten the main 
mass. 

There was a thudding jar 
deep in the rock, a soundless 
flash of yellow light, a slowly 
spreading cloud of dust in the 



eternal sunlight. The men went 
back to work. Somehow Flavia 
did not look a single inch small- 
er to them than she had before. 

TTis honeycomb helmet unac- 
A ■*" customedly heavy on his 
head and shoulders, Jothen 
rode up a secondary utility 
stack toward Gitler’s main dis- 
tribution center. The Joneses, 
once out of his sight, were also 
almost out of his mind except 
en masse, as an abstract com- 
plex of technical problems; but 
those were quite complex 
enough to suit him. He would 
let McGee deal with the Jones- 
es as people, as long as possible. 

He stopped at the next way 
station and phoned Piscetti, his 
chief of operations. 

“Everything’s normal on the 
lines,” Piscetti reported. “But 
Jothen, we’ve had a killing. One 
of us — Guivrec Krantz.” 

“My God. Who . where — ” 
“I don’t know who. Where, in 
Rest Stop BB-596, way down in 
the bottom levels, strictly non- 
residential and always were. He 
was strangled. It looks like he 
was taken by surprise, because 
there’s no sign of a struggle.” 
“All the rest of our people ac- 
counted for, I hope?” 

“Yes,” Piscetti said. “I 
checked that right away — none 
of them has been anywhere 
near that area in at least a year. 

67 



THE PIPER OF DIS 



It has to have been one of those 
crazy Joneses, somehow or 
other.” 

“Crazy is the word for it. See 
what else the computer can give 
you. The man may have given 
himself away in some way — a 
minor arrest, a lost ration-card, 
some other such bit of business. 
Anybody who’s got a special 
record of any sort.” 

“I’ll try it,” Piscetti’s voice 
said dubiously. 

“All right. I’d like to stop him 
fast if we can. We’ve got enough 
trouble as it is. I’m going on up 
to Distribution, and I’ll call you 
from there.” 

Nearly in shock — for though 
Guivrec had not been a close 
friend, he had known the man 
casually, and the maintainance 
crew was jealous of its own — 
Jothen resumed his ride up the 
stack. It discharged him at last 
into the throbbing darkness of 
the distribution center, its 
gloom relieved only here and 
there by the little stars of tell- 
tales and safelights. 

It was not a reassuring place 
to be under the circumstances, 
familiar though it was. He felt 
distinctly uneasy, and his eyes 
kept darting off into comers. 
Knotted across the far-away 
ceiling were the complexes of 
pipes which tapped shunts from 
the main overhead supply line. 
That colossal feeder — so large 



in diameter that it could accom- 
modate a six-man personnel 
capsule and now and then ac- 
tually did — served chiefly to 
bring in Gitler’s water supply 
direct from the water table up 
north, but that Was far from all 
that it carried. It also bore food, 
fuels, rock slurries and almost 
every other kind of supplies or 
semi-processed materials which 
could be moved in the form of 
self-contained peristaltic pack- 
ages. Most of this material eith- 
er originated with or had been 
routed through the Municipal 
Services Center in the Kansas 
City complex. The pipeline was 
Gitler’s jugular vein. 

At the moment, there seemed 
to be something wrong with the 
sound that it was making. 

Jothen doubted that he ought 
to be alarmed ... at least as 
yet. Though he knew most of 
its moods as well as a creche- 
mother knows the noises of a 
nursery, it seemed' logical to 
him that the master conduit 
might make a sound new to 
him, when it was approaching 
peak load — as in preparation 
for the refugee influx it was now 
doing for the first time in its 
history. After all, until the 
Joneses had arrived, it had ef- 
fectively just been sitting there 
since Gitler was built, seventy 
years ago; the burden of the 
technie village alone was small. 



68 



GALAXY 



Still, it was second nature in 
him, just as it would have been 
with a creche-mother, to check 
such matters. Climbing through 
the dimness to a cat-walk where 
there was a slave meter-board 
for the Traffic computer, he 
called for a read-out on pres- 
sures, rates of flow and what 
kinds of loads Kansas City said 
it was sending. 

F or an eternal fifteen seconds, 
he found it impossible to 
believe what he saw. Maybe it 
was not, after all, as bad as it 
seemed. As a last precaution, he 
asked for a Chicago manifest 
for the day. 

Then he pushed every red 
button in sight. 

The Joneses — all but one of 
them — heard nothing but the 
continued bawling of the public 
address system, directing them 
to the tubeways and, then, 
Jothen’s voice calling for Mc- 
Gee. But the work areas, the 
machinery decks, the utility 
stacks, the technician’s village 
and homes all jangled and 
squalled with leather-lunged 
alarm. After a while, lights on 
" the slaw board showed that 
Jothen’s emergency staffmen 
were coming onto their posts; 
but it was several minutes 
more, before the phone rang to 
bring in McGee’s voice. 

“What’s the matter, Jothen? 



Everything’s going swimmingly 
down here — or at least it was 
until now.” 

“You may have to swim for it 
in earnest,” Jothen said grimly. 
“Where are you concentrating 
your people?” 

“At the tubeway stations, just 
as you suggested.” 

“Yes, but which ones? The 
main outgoing depots, in the 
sub-basement? . That’s what 
I was afraid of. The thing is, 
there’s a very good chance that 
our prime feeder line up here is 
going to show a major break in 
about ninety minutes.” 

“How come? It’s hardly ever 
been used!” 

“That’s probably the trouble,” 
Jothen said. “Evidently there 
was a small flaw to begin with, 
or else it crystalized out dur- 
ing disuse — and I suppose the 
first strains, after the Joneses 
came in, made it worse. Any- 
how there’s a weak patch where 
a shunt goes off toward the fly- 
port fuel tanks. I still think it’s 
nothing we couldn’t handle nor- 
mally, but Chicago is shipping 
us a big bolus of pre-melted 
gallium as a moderator to start 
our main nuclear pile with, and 
when that hits that bend — ” 

“Why didn’t your computer 
show that shipment long ago?” 
McGee broke in irritably. 

“It hasn’t come onto the Kan- 
sas City block yet; I just picked 



THE PIPER OF DIS 



69 



it up off the dispatcher’s waybill 
from Chicago. Anyhow we’ll get 
nowhere arguing with it; it’s on 
the way.” 

“All right, but it still seems 
like a sloppy way to run a pipe- 
line. What do you want me to 
do?” 

“Get everybody up to the 
roof,” Jothen said. “We’ll have 
to evacuate them from the fly- 
port and from the terraces, too. 
Luckily there’s plenty of roof 
space and no air traffic to speak 
of.” 

“Everybody? A million Jones- 
es — in ninety minutes? Miracles 
aren’t my specialty, Jothen.” 

“We won’t have to evacuate 
them in that time, just get them 
aloft. You may have ten extra 
minutes, even after the main 
breaks. It’ll probably be that 
long before the liquid parts of 
the load cascade down to you. 
I’m hoping some of the gallium 
will solidify fast enough to 
block off some of the semi-hard 
junk in the pipe, but I can’t 
count on it — its melting point is 
around eighty-five, and the 
temperature up here is only fif- 
teen degrees below that right 
now. Better move fast — and 
good luck.” 

“Thanks,” McGee said, with 
more than a hint of irony. 

J othen cut over to another 
line. 



“Piscetti, Jothen here. Any 
chance of our moving a nugget- 
grade coal hopper into the shunt 
room in time to catch — ? . 
Too bad. Okay, in that event 
the first thing I want is a fluted 
baffle over the shunt-room 
drain, so the gallium won’t plug 
it; check storage for something 
light enough to truck in here 
fast. Set it up so that it slants 
the stuff off into the utility stack 
... Yes, but I’d rather have to 
chip spray out of the stack than 
try to free metal chunks from a 
roomful of frozen valves . 

“Damn it, I know we ought 
to drain the aero fuel, but we’ll 
need it up there for the incom- 
ing evacuation ferries — and be- 
sides, where’d you suggest 
draining it to? Do you 
want it stored under a jet of hot 
gallium? . Right. Now — I’m 
closing the living areas in ten 
minutes and putting all public 
stairs and walkways off limits 
to the crew, to give McGee 
queue space; we’ll use the 
stacks only. Also, there’ll be a 
gas alarm in thirty minutes for 
the work areas; whatever that 
stew from the pipes generates 
when it mixes, we dor want to 
breathe it. Got all th .? Timing 
starts in fifteen seconds . 
Mark." 

“Mark,” Piscetti said unemo- 
tionally, and his light went out. 
Overhead, the great pipeline

gave a premonitory groan. 
Jothen yanked the power jack 
out of the slave board, resettled 
the honeycomb helmet and ran 
for cover, hoping that the mas- 
ter computer had eavesdropped 
and understood his timing in- 
structions. 

It took him four minutes plus 
to make the main gallery over- 
looking the pump hall. Fronted 
with polarized, laminated glas- 
tic, the gallery was theoretical- 
ly immune to heat shock, and 
to most mechanical insults. If it 
wasn’t, Jothen would be al- 
lowed only a few seconds of 
life to regret it; he had to stay 
here until the accident arrived, 
since the gallery held the only 
gang board he could have 
hoped to have reached before- 
hand. 

Pulling down his gas mask, 
he checked the timing: yes — the 
computer was clocking both 
deadlines. The hot line from 
Kansas City was producing a 
silent red scream. He snapped it 
open. 

“Gitler, are you aware that a 
capsule of molten gallium — ” 

“Yes,” Jothen said grimly. 
“Why didn’t you stop it, KC?” 

“It had crash priority. What’s 
the matter, can’t you handle 
it?” 

“No — but now we’ve got to 
try. Get off the line, we’ve got 
troubles enough.” 



THE PIPER OF DIS 



h ;m mi- 




“Very well, Gitler. However, 
please record that we’re shunt- 
ing the river around you as of 
now.” 

“What!” Jothen shouted. 
“Listen, get me a senior monitor 
up there — this is no time for 
computer handling. We can’t do 
without the river — ” 

“This is monitor control.” 

“But . how do we drain off 
this mess you sent us, then?” 
“You’ll have to store it,” KC 
said primly. 

“Store it in what?” 

“Your problem, Gitler. We 
can’t allow you to contaminate 
the water table downstream. 
Good luck. Out.” 

“Out upon you, you — ” 

The KC line went dead. 
“Piscetti — Piscetti! . Oh, 
damn . Master computer! 
Give me a radio-active storage 
deadhead!” 

“Radio storage tanks are 
sealed,” Gitler’s computer said. 

“Open them, and reroute all 
drainage channels for receipt of 
sewage.” 

“No access,” the computer 
said. “Radio storage is under 
UNOC seal except for emer- 
gency dumping of nuclear 
wastes.” 

J othen shut the mike off for a 
moment and swore. Obvious- 
ly he could not dump the city’s 
two working power piles; that 



would leave the whole of Gitler 
without electricity. But on the 
other hand, what choice did he 
have? He had to get rid of the 
incoming garbage somehow, and 
the river was closed to him. 

“Dump the technie village pile 
in — let me see — twelve min- 
utes after the mark. Dump the 
city’s stand-by pile three min- 
utes thereafter, barring a coun- 
termanding order from me and 
nobody else. At eighteen minutes, 
shunt all city effluent into the 
radio storage tanks. And give 
me a rate-of-fill estimate for the 
tanks, keyed to radiation hazard 
for personnel in the subbase- 
ments.” 

“Minirads for personnel will 
be reached in fourteen minutes 
after the mark,” the computer 
said, with perfect indifference. 
“Radio storage capacity will fill 
and reseal at two hours aught 
two minutes. Subbasements will 
be uninhabitable for personnel 
thereafter for approximately 
twenty-eight thousand, five hun- 
dred and thirty-nine years, give 
or take four years.” 

“That’s no good. Advise Kan- 
sas City River Control that we 
will overflow hot onto the water 
table after one hour unless they 
let us spill into the river instead 
and give them a complete run- 
down on what isotopes to expect, 
halflives and all. Don’t tell me, 
tell them. Also, tell Radio-Census 



72 



GALAXY 



Washingtongrad we’re going to 
have a long-term hot spot under- 
ground here, same data. Mark 
and move on all orders when I 
switch out.” 

“Ready to mark,” the compu- 
ter said, almost as disinterestedly 
as Piscetti. 

“All right. Out.” 

Another call light lit. It was 
Piscetti back again. 

“Hello, Jothen, glad I located 
you. I’ve been picking up your 
program. But I’ve got something 
else, too. I think we’ve identified 
the murderer.” 

Jothen was astonished to dis- 
cover that he had forgotten all 
about the death of Guivrec. 
“Who is it?” 

“A Madagascan technie named 
Fongavaro Jones. He tried to join 
our maintenance staff a day or 
so after he got here, but Tanan- 
arive — that’s his home town — 
wouldn’t release him. Then he 
disappeared, and there have been 
unexplained small drains on the 
Rest Spots in the murder area 
ever since.” 

“Sounds convincing.” 

“There’s more. The news leak- 
ed out somehow, and the rest of 
the Joneses have been blowing 
up the rumors in the usual way. 
The last version I heard was that 
a homicidal maniac is on the 
loose with a laser metal-cutter. 
They say he’s already killed and 
dismembered fifteen people.” 



“I’m not surprised,” Jothen 
said grimly. 

“No, but it’s still feeding back. 
Fongavaro evidently has been 
listening in from one Rest Stop 
or another, because he now 
seems to have the idea he can 
frighten everybody away — 
maintainence staff included — 
and have the city all to him- 
self. He just tried to broadcast 
a general warning, something 
very grisly about the Stalker 
Who Strikes Unseen — wonder 
what he’s been reading lately? 
Anyhow, the computer intercept- 
ed it, compared the voice with 
the one recorded on the transfer 
application, and there we were. 
It’s Fongavaro, all right.” 

“And psychotic for sure. Put 
a squad after him, but don’t risk 
them unnecessarily — that area’s 
due to be flooded. I’d rather 
have him just kept below than 
captured if there’s no other al- 
ternative.” 

“Will do. Be sure you get out 
yourself.” 

“Right. Out.” 

A sharp hiss from the shunt 
room made him jump, but 
it was only the discharge lock, 
splitting lengthwise to emit a 
capsule whose green cocarde said 
it contained pine-nut flour. It 
lay quiescent on its receiving 
truck for a moment like a fat, 
white worm, its flexible sides 



THE PIPER OF DIS 



73 



still glistening with the water 
that had pushed it into Gitler. 
Then the truck hummed away 
with it along the tracks toward 
the community kitchens. 

The groan he had heard ear- 
lier must have been in response 
to the arrival of that load; evi- 
dently the crystallized spot in 
the main line was in even worse 
shape than he had feared. The 
discharge lock had already clos- 
ed, and at the moment the usual 
torrent of water was rushing 
along the line in its usual silence 
— but that wouldn’t last. 

He glanced at the clocks: only 
three minutes to go! It seemed 
impossible that so much time had 
already passed; yet now that he 
was watching the tumblers and 
sweep-hands, they seemed to 
freeze into immobility. The last 
sixty seconds were the longest 
in his life. Was it never going to 
happen — 

The line groaned once more. 
Then, with a crack like the snap- 
ping of a treebole, the main line 
split. Water jetted out of it. Un- 
der the intense pressure behind 
it, the jet was as smooth and hard 
as a sheet of glass; and it shat- 
tered like glass when it hit the 
baffle over the drain. The air in 
the hall became one solid, ter- 
rible shriek. Were it not for the 
glastic barriers, the sound alone 
would have killed him. 

He looked quickly over his 



shoulder to make sure that the 
one-man lift to the flyport con- 
trol tower was still standing open 
and ready. At that instant, the 
noise stopped. In the aching, in- 
tolerable silence, the crack in the 
main lengthened, and something 
white came swelling out of it 
like an obscene balloon — the 
gallium capsule or a pseudopod 
of it. 

Jothen did not wait for the 
sequel. He was into the little 
drum-shaped lift and shooting 
skyward in six seconds flat. 

Beneath him, the computer 
stolidly continued to watch, film- 
ing a miscalculation it could 
have prevented, had anybody 
had time to ask it esoteric and 
unlikely questions about rare- 
earth chemistry. As the hot spray 
of silvery metal hit the moist air 
of the shunt room, most of the 
trivalent stuff converted to the 
sesquioxide. The air seethed. 
Spitting like dragon’s poison, the 
oxide flakes struck the baffle, 
which was magnesium only 
slightly alloyed to prevent burn- 
ing. As it splashed over the baf- 
fle, the dragon’s spittle reduced 
to metallic gallium again, 
promptly and violently. 

The explosion shook the top 
levels of Gitler like a temblor. 
Jothen’s car, the compressed air 
on which it was riding snatched 
out from under it, slammed to 
a stop halfway to the flyport 



74 



GALAXY 



control tower. Trembling and 
swearing, Jothen began to climb 
the rest of the way. 

Anyhow, he thought so much 
for Fongavaro Jones. 

He had never before had so 
prompt an answer. From some- 
where behind him, a shot pierced 
his temporary deafness and rico- 
cheted, squealing away from the 
riser three inches from his left 
foot, leaving a bright weal in the 
metal. 

Ill 

I t had been easy enough for 
Fongavaro to come by the 
gun. Except for the very small 
and inexperienced police squad 
— half of which was already 
hunting for him — nobody in 
Gitler went armed, of course; 
but here, as in Tananarive and 
in every other city, there was 
a small cache of sidearms in 
every fifth Rest Stop, stored 
there for the technics’ use 
against the possibility of a real- 
ly major riot. Though he had 
never fired a gun and expected 
to continue to prefer strangula- 
tion, Fongavaro had appropriat- 
ed a pistol early on, just in case. 

It would probably have been 
rather more difficult for him to 
say exactly when he had come to 
believe that Jothen Kent was 
the principal agent of all his 
troubles. In one sense, the reali- 



zation had swept over him, when 
he had listened in on the Gitler 
official’s directions for hunting 
him down or allowing him to 
drown. At least, it was then that 
he had realized that killing Joth- 
en Kent would now be only self- 
defense. 

But in another sense, it seem- 
ed to him that he had always 
known it. After all, it must have 
been Kent who had turned down 
his original petition to be trans- 
ferred to Gitler’s working crew; 
surely no computer would have 
been entrusted with an applica- 
tion so important. It was on 
Kent’s order that the Joneses 
were being evacuated, obviously 
a transparent maneuver to ship 
Fongavaro home by force under 
cover of a fake emergency — 
what sane man would believe 
that story about a giant meteor? 
— no matter how many other 
people’s civil rights were violated 
in the process. And surely it 
must have been Kent who had 
cunningly alerted the computer 
to any possible further message 
from the fugitive. Fongavaro 
knew something about computers 
and had carefully and cleverly 
worded his warning to get it 
past any mechanical intelligence 
that lacked the guidance of a 
human enemy. But for Kent, 
it couldn’t have failed. 

In any event, it was now per- 
factly clear that Fongavaro could 



THE PIPER OF DIS 



75 



not hope to have Gitler to him- 
self while Jothen Kent was alive. 
Without Kent the evacuation of 
the Joneses would fall apart — 
this McGee, with whom Kent 
was trying to confuse him, was 
obviously only some sort of min- 
or politician or other flunky — 
and the milling hordes would 
then be easy to panic. In addi- 
tion, the hounding of Fongavaro 
himself would stop, deprived of 
the leadership of the one man 
who was really out to get him. 
It all made perfect sense. 

Avoiding the patrols and get- 
ting out of the subbasements was 
simple. After all, he could hear 
every order that Kent issued, 
even those that didn’t seem to 
bear directly on hunting him 
down. For the same reason, find- 
ing where Kent was working and 
was planning to go next had been 
equally easy. Fongavaro worked 
his way cautiously up the utility 
stack, stalking the stalker. 

The explosion threw him and 
enraged him. He had not ex- 
pected Kent to be ready to 
destroy a part of the city to get 
him. He was almost as surprised 
to see his prey erupt from the 
lift-shaft in mid-air, so to speak, 
and go on up toward the flyport 
on foot. But he was determined 
to let nothing that Kent could do 
rattle him — nothing! 

Regaining his footing, he point- 
ed the gun. 



Of course, he missed and nearly 
lost hold of the little automatic, 
to boot. But it did not look like 
he had missed by much. He took 
aim again, this time using both 
hands. 

“Fongavaro!” 

That was Kent’s voice, echoing 
down the stack. It was bound to 
be a trick. 

“Fongavaro! Cut it out, man! 
Don’t you want to get out of this 
alive?” 

“I’m not getting out,” Fon- 
gavaro said — to his own sur- 
prise, for he had not meant to 
answer at all. “You can’t scare 
me away — ” 

“Then you’re being a damn 
fool. The main feeder line’s 
broken, and the city’s flooding. 
Throw away the gun and come 
on aloft with me. I’ll help you 
if I can. There are planes up 
there, waiting to take you all 
home.” 

At the word “planes,” the 
whole of the stack washed out 
into a red blur, and Fongavaro’s 
ears roared with the pulsing of 
his own blood. Through the 
pounding confusion, he heard the 
gun go off . but when he could 
see again, Jothen Kent had van- 
ished. 

r T''he providential emergency

a section of the city with which 
he was unfamilar — and worse,

GALAXY 



it was empty. It appeared to be 
a residential area, perhaps the 
topmost one under the technie 
village. The air of the street was 
full of settling dust, which con- 
fused him further, since he had 
never seen such a thing before. 
He could only guess that it was 
some aftermath of the explosion 
and was glad his gas mask was 
in place. 

There was of course no way 
to lock the emergency exit, and 
he wasted no time seeking ways 
to jam or block it. His only im- 
pulse was to run. He did not 
like being shot at. 

But run to where? In the dis- 
tance, he heard a compound 
rumble of many voices, some 
of them shouting. That might 
just be the sound of a column 
of Joneses, being led up motor- 
stairs toward the roof. If so, 
there might be one or two of 
his own men there who would 
be armed; or at worst, he ought 
to be able to lose himself in the 
crowd. Panting, he took off. 

There was a blurred yell, 
hardly human, behind him and 
then another shot. How many 
rounds did that gun have in it, 
anyhow? He remembered, not 
too certainly, that the standard 
automatic was a high-velocity 
weapon that bit tiny splinters of 
lead azide off the end of a roll 
of plastic-fill tape; if Fongavaro 
had one of those, it was good 



for a least a hundred tries at 
Jothen before even a dub at 
guns would have to try to re- 
load it or throw it away. Jothen 
promptly tried to run faster, 
but short of free flight he was 
already making better time than 
he would have thought possible 
before. 

He careened around a circle of 
silently watching coupon shops, 
all as empty of merchandise as 
they were of people, and slowed 
down at the main entrance to 
another utility stack. It was 
sealed — by his own order. But 
the crowd noise now seemed 
quite close. Cutting down a de- 
serted avenue, he found himself 
charging now into an exchange 
plaza. 

His heart gave a bound of 
hope. The plaza was full of push- 
ing, flushed, scared figures in 
torn costumes — some carrying 
or tugging at quarreling or squal- 
ling children, others dragging 
baggage they had never had to 
tote before, still others finding 
it difficult to shuffle their own 
two feet. From the midst of the 
mob, two broad spiral escala- 
tors, twined around each other 
like twinned genes, wound up- 
ward through the remote roof, 
packet with restive Joneses. 

He tried to work his way 
through them and was indignant- 
ly shoved back at, until the 
people around him took second 



THE PIPER OF DIS

looks at him and saw the honey- 
comb helmet. Then they gave 
way, but slowly and sullenly. 
The Gitler crew was not, it was 
painfully clear, very popular 
around here at the moment. 

Slow though his progress was, 
Jothen should have been pleas- 
ed with it, for he was surely 
quite buried in this mass of 
flesh now. But instead he felt 
stifled, he himself on the verge 
of panic. Sweating, he went on 
shouldering his way forward, 
trying to pull through the gas 
mask thick, wet air that had no 
odor but completely refused to 
move into his lungs. 

The helmet jolted suddenly on 
his head and shoulders as he 
jammed himself onto the near- 
est escalator: somebody had 

tried to punch him where it us- 
ually counted. Then he was on 
the stairs and being swung up 
and up, around and around, and 
the plaza was fading into a lake 
of bent heads and angry upturn- 
ed faces. Breathing a long sigh 
of relief, he looked back at the 
boulevard by which he had come 
galloping into this press. 

F ongavaro was standing there, 
the street empty behind him, 
his monkey body and ragged 
filth marking him off from the 
other costumes almost as read- 
ily as the neat, viscious little 
gun in his hand. Jothen felt an 



impulse to thumb his nose; but 
at the same moment, the fore- 
shortened Madagascar raised the 
pistol at the end of both long 
arms and fired it squarely at 
Jothen’s head. How could he tell 
which of all these stair-riders — 

The helmet! Even among all 
these unintelligibly costumed 
people, there could be no mistak- 
ing that bulging, functional car- 
apace; it said Gitler to all the 
Joneses, and Jothen to Fongav- 
aro, like a scarlet tattoo. And 
Jothen did not dare take it off, 
even if the spiral swath of bodies 
around him had left any cranny 
in which to hide it; it was now 
his only contact with Piscetti, 
with McGee, with the crew, with 
the world-at-large. 

Where the hell was the armed 
squad? How long was this damn- 
ed go-around motor-stair ride 
going to take? How far up — 

Splat! 

The sound of the automatic 
was only a stitch in the fabric 
of the crowd’s noise, but Jothen 
— and probably Jothen alone — 
could hear it all to well. He 
flinched helplessly inside the 
honeycomb, feeling as though 
the whole front of his helmeted 
head was one enormous target. 

But Fongavaro, amazingly, did 
not seem to think he was getting 
anywhere at all. Jamming the 
still-potent gun somewhere in- 
side his rags, he scuttled almost 



79 



GALAXY 



on his knuckles along the fring- 
es of the mob until he came upon 
a fat and fussy old Jones in a 
Pierrot suit who seemed to be 
trying to load his life’s posses- 
sions into a battered but still 
floating autocrutch. Dumping the 
oldster and the luggage with a 
single brutal sweep of his fore- 
arms, Fongavaro straddled the 
machine and scooted in a long, 
wabbly parabola toward the top 
of the motor-stair tree. 

The hole in the ceiling swallow- 
ed Jothen, before he saw the 
end of that crazy ride. He was 
just as glad, but he knew better 
now than to draw any deep 
breaths; he was still on the run. 

The next level was the floor 
of the technie village, quiet and 
bucolic and familiar ordinarily. 
Now it was a shambles. The 
overflow Joneses — out of sight 
and hence out of mind of Gitler’s 
few and tentative police — were 
making up for the loss of their 
totems and baggage by looting 
the technie’s homes. There was 
nobody around to prevent them 
or even to herd them back to- 
ward the roof; they were spread- 
ing out all through the level, 
giggling, singing and throwing 
bottles at each other. Fuming 
with indignation, Jothen threw 
a leg over the stairs to get back 
down to the floor; somebody had 
to break up this orgy — 

Splat! 



Another poisonous, explosive 
little bullet flew by his helmet 
and drove him back to his main 
interest: flight. Casting franti- 
cally about for the shot’s source, 
Jothen saw Fongavaro rowelling 
his autocrutch, riding tail-up and 
sidewise, out of the mouth of a 
ventilator shaft about half a mile 
away. The Madagascan’s expres- 
sion was unreadable at this dis- 
tance, but his whole posture 
telegraphed black murder in any 
language. 

There had to be some way out 
of this cul-de-sac. It was ri- 
diculous that Fongavaro should 
be able to make better time 
through the pores and doors 
of Gitler than Jothen himself 
could. The technies’ access shaft 
to the flyport control tower had 
to be on this level. If only he 
could bull his way off these 
damn stairs — 

Like a scuba diver, Jothen roll- 
ed over the moving handrail of 
the stairs and dropped to the 
floor of the village. Fongavaro 
banked around the stairs and 
swooped down over the heads of 
his scampering cousins; but he 
was having a hard time with the 
lurching autocrutch, which had 
not been designed for aerobatics. 
He overshot Jothen so fast that 
he nearly rammed into the far 
side of the square. 

While he was still fighting to 
regain control of his clumsy me-

tal broomstick, more than half 
of the lights dimmed and went 
out, to a groan of dismay from 
the Joneses. The computer, re- 
stricted now to battery power, 
was economizing. 

The sudden gloom was just 
what Jothen needed. By the time 
Fongavaro was in condition to 
look for his quarry again, Jothen 
was already in the lift.

Xl. as anybody got a gun?” 

In the control tower, heads 
turned blindly toward Jothen, 
with the tense impatience of men 
distracted from serious work by 



nonsense. Then one of the crew 
recognized him. 

“I think there are some signal 
pistols up here, Mr. Kent. If 
they’re still operative. We don’t 
expect to need them.” 

“Won’t do. I mean a gun I 
can kill somebody with.” 

“Kill somebody — ? No, sir, 
nothing of that sort?” the tower 
man said stiffly, and went back 
to work. Only one other operator 
had been listening to the brief 
exchange with less than half of 
his attention. His expression 
clearly showed that he thought 
he had probably missed a key 
word somewhere. 

Jothen sighed and looked out 
over the flyport. From here he 



80 



GALAXY 





could see no trace of the ex- 
plosion, unless he counted a 
small but rapidly rising column 
of white smoke from a ventilator 
head about a mile away. The rest 
was silence. Beginning right at 
the edge of the flyport, the Mon- 
terrey pines, hybrid poplars, 
bamboo and giant sugar-cane — 
the food of the world — covered 
the whole of Gitler, marching 
solemnly down the terraces and 
Chinese Avails and joining the 
rest of the World Forest so 
smoothly that the city’s edges 
were impossible to define from 
the air. From here, the world 
was in a pastoral sleep. 

Overhead, the autumn dusk 
was deepening, soft and clear. 



There was no moon, but already 
the night gave promise of a 
blaze of stars with, of course, 
no sky-glare to mock them. 
Among one constellation’s scatter 
of suns — he could not tell 
which — Jothen could make out 
several distant moving lights: 
probably the first planes of the 
ferry fleet. Transcorp had moved 
fast, as usual. 

Evidently McGee had also 
moved fast. A growing murmur 
of many voices, like a distant sea, 
told Jothen that a surf of Jone- 
ses was already out on the roof 
of that city. He could see sev- 
eral amoeboid batches of them, 
dim and sad in their drooping 
finery, clumping together like 



THE PIPER OF DIS 



81 



slime-molds on the flyport’s 
staging apron; but most of them 
were invisible, masked by the 
trees. That accounted in part for 
the uneasy edge to the susurrus. 
Ordinarily, nobody was allowed 
in the World Forest but Rangers 
and repairmen of the Pipeline 
Corps, and the Joneses doubtless 
were finding the open air and the 
towering silent woods disquiet- 
ing. 

“Let’s stick together, friends 
and clansmen!” McGee’s voice 
bellowed suddenly. He was using 
a bullhorn, but even so his voice 
was tinny with the distance. 
“Don’t wander, don’t wander! 
There’s grandfathers in them 
trees! Stay by the flyport — don’t 
get left behind!” 

“Up your Jones!” a much tin- 
ier voice shouted. A ragged chor- 
us returned the cheer. 

“That’s it! Up Joneses! Stay 
close!” 

McGee seemed to be mana- 
ging — so far, so good. But what 
had happened to Fongavaro? And 
why was it so dark? The Joneses 
should find it easier to stick close 
to the flyport if they could see 
its lights, but those were steadily 
going out. Even the beacons were 
mostly dead. Jothen pulled his 
cheek-mike into place to reas- 
sume direction of his city and 
found that that, too, was dead. 

The computer’s economy mea- 
sures were becoming drastic. It 

82 



could not be faulted for that; 
battery power does not last very 
long. But the power failure was 
damn dangerous and would com- 
plicate the evacuation; even if 
the motorstairs continued to 
work, for instance, the ferries 
would have to land blind, by 
PPI radar. 

And no wonder McGee was us- 
ing a bullhorn instead of the pub- 
lic address system. The man was 
resourceful, that had to be grant- 
ed. 

I t got slowly darker, despite the 
emerging stars. The Forest 
whimpered, as if remembering 
the ghosts of long-extinct ani- 
mals. Underfoot, something 
thumped — a secondary explo- 
sion? — and the murmuring of 
the Joneses grew louder. They 
were already confused by the 
conflicting orders, angry at hav- 
ing had their fun cut off and 
probably still making everything 
worse with the undertow of ru- 
mor. And now, also, they were 
becoming afraid of the strange 
noises and the deepening night. 

Something like a bat — or what 
Jothen imagined might be like a 
bat — swooped suddenly in front 
of his face. It took him a moment 
to realize that the thing was ac- 
tually some distance away; and 
then, that it was Fongavaro on 
his autocrutch. He was flying 
very badly. That was not surpris- 



GALAXY 



ing, for the fan-driven prosthetic 
machines had never been design- 
ed for the open air; but the wild 
way he was lurching around the 
sky could not be entirely the 
fault of the crutch. He was fight- 
ing not only the machine, but 
himself: terror fugatis. 

Jothen looked away. There was 
nothing he could do now; he had 
gone as far as he could go. He 
switched his headset to the emer- 
gency channel; it responded with 
a gratifying hum. 

“McGee?” 

It would not have surprised 
him had the putative Mayor nev- 
er heard of the emergency chan- 
nel; but McGee responded at 
once. 

“Hello, Jothen — where the hell 
have you been? Never mind, 
noisy down here. Have to talk to 
you later.” 

“Hold on—” 

“Sorry. Got my hands full of 
Joneses. Are the ferries coming?” 

“Yes, on the way. Are you — ” 

“Good. Hold fast. Out.” 

While Jothen spluttered, the 
bullhorn began to sound again. 
Torches began to light, too, some 
of them among the trees. “Fire 
in the Forest?” Jothen bawled 
into his cheek-mike, but there 
was no answer. 

More Joneses poured out onto 
the flyport and into the woods. 
The tower deck rumbled under 
Jothen’s feet. 



Then, there was light. 

First the tops of the trees turn- 
ed silvery. Then, on the roofs, 
the blackness became stippled 
with tiler’s dots, as hundreds of 
thousands of white faces turned 
skyward. A long moan rolled 
through the Joneses like a comb- 
er. Jothen too looked up. 

A falling star, so immense that 
it might have been a falling sun, 
was streaking with preternatural 
slowness over the city, lighting 
the whole landscape with a gar- 
ish blue-white glare. The side of 
a nearby ferry, just settling in 
for a landing, gleamed in the 
glow as though a searchlight were 
playing upon it. 

The light seemed to be what 
Fogavaro had been waiting for. 
Either he had dropped the gun 
or had forgotten it in his fear of 
the open sky and the mechanical 
besom he was a-stride of. In- 
stead, he swerved toward the im- 
mobile giant of the control tower 
and came bulleting directly at the 
broad windows. 

The noise of the meteor’s pas- 
sage had already reached the 
ground, a loud rumbling like the 
thunder of distance artillery. 
Cries of awe and fright rose from 
the Forest to meet it. For a wild 
instant, Jothen wondered if this 
were the monster Flavia herself, 
ahead of schedule and far too 
far to the south; but in the same 
second he realized that it was 



THE PIPER OF DIS

probably only one of the frag- 
ments Biond Smith’s crew had 
chipped off the asteroid — a 
small one, probably no more than 
a hundred tons. 

Two thirds of the way across 
the sky, the meteor exploded, 
blindingly. Fiery streaks rayed 
away, nearly to the horizon. Fon- 
gavaro, almost close enough now 
for Jothen to see his features, 
jerked his craft upward, half- 
rolled, and ran side-on into a 
descending ferry. 

The ferry, only dented, lurched 
and righted itself, but the auto- 
crutch disintegrated. Its bright 
fragments and the sprawling 
black figure of Fongavaro Jones 
rained down from Heaven to- 
gether toward Chaos and Dis, in 
a blast of sound from the ex- 
ploded bolide that made the ex- 
plosion in the shunt room seem 
like it had been only a warning 
slap. 

Fongavaro’s long nightmare of 
falling had come true and now 
was ended. 

nphe cries of the Joneses grew 
louder, edged with hysteria. 
On the flyport apron, a woman’s 
voice was screaming, “The end of 
the world! Grandfather is fallen! 
The end of the world!” 

Jothen, shaking, tried again to 
call McGee and then Piscetti; but 
if either replied, their voices were 
drowned out in an enormous wa- 



terfall that seemed to have got- 
ten started in his earphones. 
When he got his sight back, he 
saw why: the passage of the me- 
teor had left a broad trail of 
glowing white vapor stretched 
across the sky like an infernal 
rainbow. The ionized wake had 
completely wiped out radio re- 
ception, probably all across the 
spectrum. 

Below, the torches began to 
swirl. The crowd noise was rising 
to a roar. The dented ferry, rock- 
ing on its fans, was settling to the 
apron, and another was coming 
in. 

Too late, Jothen thought 
numbly. They're goin§ to panic. 

And there was exactly nothing 
that he could do about it, even 
had he had any idea of how to 
proceed. The shadowy figures of 
the tower stand-by crew, muster- 
ed to replace the out-of-action 
computer, were already bustling 
in the gloom around him, ready 
to assist the ferry landings the 
moment radio contact should be 
established — or perhaps they 
were using FM and had never 
lost contact in the first place. He 
would have to give them what- 
ever helping hand he could — 

Another meteor bloomed in the 
night sky, rumbling like a thun- 
derhead. It was not as big as the 
first, but the Joneses were by 
now in no mood to be discrimi- 
nating. 



84 



GALAXY 



Then Jothen heard McGee’s 
voice cutting across the din, his 
bullhorn turned up to full ampli- 
fication — a gargantuan bellow 
that must have been audible even 
in the still airborne ferries. Aston- 
ishingly, the Mayor was singing. 
Had he gone mad too? 

Raise the totems, Gott soil 
Hue ten, 

Fa-la- fa-de-rol and cordon 

bleu! 

Jericho immune to tootin’, 

Mighty Mothe, we love you! 

Or so Jothen heard it — surely 
these couldn’t really be the 
words. But the Joneses seemed to 
recognize them: a family hymn? 
Scattered voices took up the song, 
and then, many more. 

“That’s it, Joneses! All togeth- 
er now!” 

The second meteor blew up. 
Under the light and noise, and 
that of the ferries’ fans, the sing- 
ing became defiantly louder. 

Hubbard’s husband, Hubba’s 
wife, 

Smith's disaster, Brown’s dis- 
may, 

Guard of Uncle UNOC’s life, 

Faithful shepherd, A-OK! 

Jothen heard himself emit a 
nervous giggle and suppressed it 
angrily. Dammit, that surely 
wasn’t how the words went! He 
tried to pay attention to some- 
thing that mattered. Six or seven 
ferries were on the ground now, 
and Joneses were pouring out of

the Forest toward them, led by 
a tiny, frenetically waving figure. 
McGee seemed to be leading 
some kind of a snake dance onto 
the tarmac. 

A third and a fourth meteor 
arched across the sky together, 
roaring. The crowd howled back 
its challenge. The first ferry was 
loaded and taking off again. Near 
several of the others, Joneses 
about to board were ceremonial- 
ly snuffing out torches in upended 
metal drums that seemed to have 
materialized by magic for just 
this purpose. 

Another ferry buzzed off, then 
another. 

“All right, neighbors! Every- 
body now! Hit it!” 



THE PIPER OF DIS 



85 



The piper’s charges raised their 
voices in a deafening chorus. 
Nothing else in the world could 
have been heard above such a 
choir, not even a major earth- 
quake — by now there must have 
been nearly half a million people 
involved, spread out all over the 
roofs; it was as though Hell itself 
were singing. Distance muddled 
the hymn into a shapeless, tune- 
less thunder, but Jothen could 
still hear McGee; 

Con Ed cons us, UNOC 
bombs us, 

Devils hearstle at our bones — 

Still the jolly heartside chorus : 

Love us all, and up your 
Jones! 

The sky was full of planes. And 
then, suddenly, the flyport lights 
went on. Whether or not Piscetti 
had gotten the floods under con- 
trol, the master computer had 
reached the end of its allotted 
clock-time and had restored 
power to the city. 

The evacuation of the Jones 
Convention would keep right on 
going, for many days — but the 
crisis was over. Useless, tubby 
McGee had piped his rats aboard. 

J othen had stopped shaking by 
the time he had gotten back 
to his office, but he could not 
honestly have described himself 
as unshaken. He was glad — God 
knew — that it was all essentially 



over, but there were still major 
questions that he could not begin 
to answer for himself. He sat 
down at his disordered console 
and thought about them con- 
scientiously, but not to much 
purpose. 

He still had no notion of how 
he was going to cope — both 
practically and emotionally — 
with the Chicago influx, after 
having spent most of his adult 
life virtually alone in so heavily 
populated a world. He had not 
done very well this time; indeed, 
he had damn near gotten himself 
killed, and the city was in ter- 
rible shape. He felt both incom- 
petent and oppressed. 

It seemed that there was no 
such thing as a single crisis. 
Every one was a fall of dominoes. 
It took a lot of footwork just to 
stay abreast of them. 

He noticed with a start that 
the line to Prime Center was 
blinking at him. Numbly, he op- 
ened it. 

“Jothen?” Biond Smith’s voice 
said. 

“Here. Hullo, Biond.” 

“How did it go? KC tells me 
you’re having a terrible scram- 
ble. Did you get the Joneses 
moving?” 

“They’re on their way,” Jothen 
said. He was surprised to hear 
that Biond, too, sounded oppress- 
ed. Evidently World Directors 
also had their troubles. 



86 



GALAXY 



“Good. Was McGee of any 
use? He’s fairly good with paper, 
I’ve found.” 

“He was invaluable,” Jothen 
said. “Especially during the me- 
teor shower.” 

“Meteor shower?” Biond said, 
his voice cracking slightly. “Did 
those fragments come down as far 
south as Gitler? Obviously they 
did. Damn, somebody’s miscalcu- 
lated; I’ll have to get on that. 
And now we get to the meat of 
the matter — Flavia, and the real 
evacuations. You’d better keep 
McGee there, as long as he was 
helpful. He doesn’t know a dyne 



from a dinosaur, of course, but all 
the same these ward-heeler types 
have their uses. I’m one myself. 
Glad you’re all right, Jothen. 
Bye.” 

The line went dead. 

Taking a deep breath, Jothen 
set his face and his soul in order 
and went out to meet his world 
— or his doom. Maybe by now 
there wasn’t any difference. 

But somehow he felt that he 
would be more on top of things, if 
only he could figure out what a 
“ward-heeler” was.

THE PIPER OF DIS 87 



AMONG THE 
HAIRY EARTHMEN 

by R„ A. LAFFERTY 



The Children went to Earth. They 
played some childish games — and 
the Earthmen called them History! 



nphere is one period of our 
World History that has as- 
pects so different from anything 
that went before and after that 
we can only gaze back on those 
several hundred years and ask: 

“Was that ourselves who be- 
haved so?” 

Well, no, as a matter of fact, 
it wasn’t. It was beings of an- 
other sort who visited us briefly 
and who acted so gloriously and 
abominably. 

This is the way it was: 

nphe Children had a Long Af- 
ternoon free. They could go 
to any of a dozen wonderful 
places, but they were already in 
one. 



Seven of them — full to the 
craw of wonderful places — decid- 
ed to go to Eretz. 

“Children are attracted to the 
oddest and most shambling 
things,” said the Mothers. “Why 
should they want to go to 
Eretz?” 

“Let them go,” said the Fath- 
ers. “Let them see — before they 
be gone — one of the few simple 
peoples left. We ourselves have 
become a contrived and com- 
promized people. Let the Chil- 
dren be children for half a day.” 

Eretz was the Planet of the 
Offense, and therefore it was to 
be (perhaps it recently had 
been) the Planet of the Restitu- 
tion also. But in no other way 



88 



was it distinguished. The Chil- 
dren had received the tradition 
of Eretz as children receive all 
traditions — like lightning. 

Hobble, Michael Goodgrind, 
Ralpha, Lonnie, Laurie, Bea and 
Joan they called themselves as 
they came down on Eretz- — for 
these were their idea of Eretzi 
names. But they could have as 
many names as they wished in 
their games. 

An anomalous intrusion of 
great heat and force! The rocks 
ran like water where they came 
down, and there was formed a 
scarp-pebble enclave. 

It was all shanty country and 
shanty towns on Eretz — clumsy 
hills, badly done plains and 
piedmonts, ragged fields, un- 
cleansed rivers, whole weed- 
patches of provinces — not at all 
like Home. And the Towns! 
Firenze, Praha, Venezia, Londra, 
Colonia, Gant, Roma — why, they 
were nothing but towns made out 
of stone and wood! And these 
were the greatest of the towns of 
Eretz, not the meanest. 

The Children exploded into ac- 
tion. Like children of the less 
transcendent races running wild 
on an ocean beach for an after- 
noon, they ran wild over conti- 
nents. They scattered. And they 
took whatever forms first came 
into their minds. 

Hobble — dark and smoldering 
like crippled Vulcan. 



Michael Goodgrind — a broken- 
nosed bull of a man. How they 
all howled when he invented that 
first form! 

Ralpha — like young Mercury. 

And Lonnie — a fall giant with 
a golden beard. 

Laurie was fire, Bea was light, 
Joan was moon-darkness. 

But in these, or in any other 
forms they took, you’d always 
know that they were cousins or 
brethren. 

T onnie went pure Gothic. He 
had come onto it at the 
tail end of the thing and he fell 
in love with it. 

“I am the Emperor!” he told 
the people like giant thunder. He 
pushed the Emperor Wenceslas 
off the throne and became Em- 
peror. 

“I am the true son of Charles, 
and you had thought me dead,” 
he told the people. “I am Sigis- 
mund.” Sigismund was really 
dead, but Lonnie became Sigis- 
mund and reigned, taking the 
wife and all the castles of Wen- 
ceslas. He grabbed off gangling 
old forts and mountain-rooks and 
raised howling Eretzi armies to 
make war. He made new castles. 
He loved the tall sweeping things 
and raised them to a new height. 
Have you never wondered that 
the last of those castles — in the 
late afternoon of the Gothic — 
were the tallest and oddest? 



AMONG THE HAIRY EARTHMEN 



89 



One day the deposed Wences- 
las came back, and he was pos- 
sessed of a new power. 

“Now we will see who is the 
real Emperor!” the new Wences- 
las cried like a rising storm. 

They clashed their two forces 
and broke down each other’s 
bridges and towns and stole the 
high ladies from each other’s 
strongholds. They wrestled like 
boys. But they wrestled with a 
continent. 

Lonnie (who was Sigismund) 
learned that the Wenceslas he 
battled was Michael Goodgrind 
wearing a contrived Emperor 
body. So they fought harder. 

There came a new man out of 
an old royal line. 

“I am Jobst,” the new man 
cried. “I will show you two 
princelings who is the real Em- 
peror!” 

He fought the two of them 
with overwhelming verve. He 
raised fast-striking Eretzi armies, 
and used tricks that only a 
young Mercury would know. He 
was Ralpha, entering the game 
as the third Emperor. But the 
two combined against him and 
broke him at Constance. 

They smashed Germany and 
France and Italy like a clutch of 
eggs. Never had there been such 
spirited conflict. The Eretzi were 
amazed by it all, but they were 
swept into it; it was the Eretzi 
who made up the armies. 



Even today the Eretzi or 
Earthers haven’t the details of 
it right in their histories. When 
the King of Aragon, for an ex- 
ample, mixed into it, they treat- 
ed him as a separate person. 
They did not know that Michael 
Goodgrind was often the King of 
Aragon, just as Lonnie was often 
the Duke of Flanders. But, 
played for itself, the Emperor 
game would be quite a limited 
one. Too limited for the children. 

r T''he girls played their own 
-*■ roles. Laurie claimed to be 
thirteen different queens. She 
was consort of all three Emper- 
ors in every one of their guises, 
and she also dabbled with the 
Eretzi. She was the wanton of 
the group. 

Bea liked the Grande Dame 
part and the Lady Bountiful bit. 
She was very good on Great Re- 
nunciations. In her different 
characters, she beat paths from 
thrones to nunneries and back 
again; and she is now known as 
five different saints. Every time 
you turn to the Common of the 
Mass of Holy Women who are 
Neither Virgins nor Martyrs, 
you are likely to meet her. 

And Joan was the dreamer 
who may have enjoyed the Af- 
ternoon more than any of them. 

Laurie made up a melodrama 
— Lucrezia Borgia and the Poison 
Ring. There is an advantage in 



90 



GALAXY 



doing these little melodramas on 
Eretzi. You can have as many 
characters as you wish — they 
come free. You can have them 
act as extravagantly as you de- 
sire — who is there to object to 
it? Lucrezia was very well done, 
as children’s burlesques go, and 
the bodies were strewn from Nap- 
oli to Vienne. The Eretzi play 
with great eagerness any con- 
vincing part offered them, and 
they go to their deaths quite 
willingly if the part calls for it. 

Lonnie made one up called 
The Pawn-Broker and the Pope. 
It was in the grand manner, all 
about the Medici family, and 
had some very funny episodes 
in the fourth act. Lonnie, who 
was vain of his acting ability, 
played Medici parts in five suc- 
ceeding generations. The drama 
left more corpses than did the 
Lucrezia piece, but the killings 
weren’t so sudden or showy; 
the girls had a better touch at the 
bloody stuff. 

Ralpha did a Think Piece 
called One, Two, Three — Infin- 
ity. In its presentation he put 
all the rest of the Children to 
roast grandly in Hell; he filled 
up Purgatory with Eretzi-type 
people — the dullards; and for the 
Paradise he did a burlesque of 
Home. The Eretzi use a cropped 
version of Ralpha’s piece and 
call it the Divine Comedy, leav- 
ing out a lot of fun. 

AMONG THE HAIRY EARTHMEN 



Bea did a poetic one named 
the Witches’ Bonfire. All the 
Children spent many a happy 
evening with that one, and they 
burnt twenty thousand witches. 
There was something satisfying 
about those Eretzi autumnal twi- 
lights with the scarlet sky and 
the frosty fields and the kine 
lowing in the meadows and the 
evening smell of witches burn- 
ing. Bea’s was really a pastoral 
piece. 

A ll the Children ranged far ex- 
cept Hobble. Hobble (who 
was Vulcan) played with his sick 
toys. He played at Ateliers and 
Smithies, at Furnaces and Car- 
ousels. And often the other Chil- 
dren came and watched his work, 
and joined in for a while. 

They played with the glass 
from the furnaces. They made 
gold-toned goblets, iridescent 
glass poems, figured spheres, 
goblin pitchers, glass music 
boxes, gargoyle heads, dragon 
chargers, princess salieras, fig- 
urines of lovers. So many things 
to make of glass! To make, and 
to smash when made! 

But some of the things they 
exchanged as gifts instead of 
smashing them — glass birds and 
horses, fortune-telling globes that 
showed changing people and 
scenes within, tuned chiming 
balls that rang like bells, glass 
cats that sparked when stroked, 

91 



wolves and bears, witches that 
flew. 

The Eretzi found some of these 
things that the Children discard- 
ed. They studied them and imi- 
tated them. 

And again, in the interludes of 
their other games, the Children 
came back to Hobble’s shops 
where he sometimes worked with 
looms. They made costumes of 
wool and linen and silk. They 
made trains and cloaks and man- 
tles, all the things for their grand 
masquerades. They fabricated 
tapestries and rugs and wove in 
all sorts of scenes : vistas of 
Home and of Eretz, people and 
peacocks, fish and cranes, dingles 
and dromedaries, larks and lov- 
ers. They set their creations in 
the strange ragged scenery of 
Eretz and in the rich contrived 
gardens of Home. A spark went 
from the Children to their weav- 
ing so that none could tell 
where they left off and their 
creations began. 

Then they left poor Hobble 
and went on to their more vital 
games. 

'Tphere were seven of them (six, 
not counting the backward 
Hobble), but they seemed a 
thousand. They built themselves 
Castles in Spain and Gardes in 
Languedoc. The girls played al- 
ways at Intrigue, for the high 
pleasure of it, and to give a caus- 

92 



us for the wars. And the wars 
were the things that the boys 
seldom tired of. It is fun to play 
at armies with live warriors; and 
the Eretzi were live ... in a 
sense. 

The Eretzi had had wars and 
armies and sieges long before 
this, but they had been aimless 
things. Oh, this was one field 
where the Eretzi needed the 
Children. Consider the battles 
that the Children engineered that 
afternoon : 

Gallipoli — how they managed 
the ships in that one! The Fath- 
ers could not have maneuvered 
more intricately in their four- 
dimension chess at Home. 

Adrianople, Kunovitza, Dibra, 
Varna, Hexamilion! It’s fun just 
to call out the bloody names of 
battles. 

Constantinople! That was the 
one where they first used the big 
cannon. But who cast the big 
cannon for the Turks there? In 
their histories the Eretzi say 
that it was a man named Orban 
or Urban, and that he was Dac- 
ian, or he was Hungarian, or he 
was Danish. How many places 
did you tell them that you came 
from, Michael Goodgrind? 

Belgrad, Trebizond, Morat, 
Blackheath, Napoli, Dornach! 

Cupua and Taranto — Ralpha’s 
armies beat Michael’s at both of 
those. 

Carignola — Lonnie foxed both 

GALAXY 



Michael and Ralpha there, and 
nearly foxed himself. ( Y ou didn’t 
intend it all that way, Lonnie. It 
was seven-cornered luck and 
you know it!) 

Garigliano where the sea was 
red with blood and the ships 
were like broken twigs on the 
water! 

Brescia! Ravenna! Who would 
have believed that such things 
could be done with a device 
known as Spanish infantry? 

Villalar, Milan, Pavia! Best of 
all, the sack of Rome! There 
was a dozen different games 
blended into that one. The Eretzi 
discovered new emotions in 
themselves there — a deeper de- 
pravity and a higher heroism. 

Siege of Florence! That one 
called out the Children’s every 
trick. A wonderfully well played 
game! 

Turin, San Quentin, Moncon- 
tour, Mookerhide! 

Lepanto! The great sea-siege 
where the castled ships broke as- 
under and the tall Turk Ochiali 
Pasha perished with all his fleet 
and was drowned forever. But it 
wasn’t so forever as you might 
suppose, for he was Michael 
Goodgrind who had more bodies 
than one. The fish still remember 
Lepanto. Never had there been 
such feastings. 

Alcazar-Quivar! That was the 
last of the excellent ones — the 
end of the litany. The Children 

AMONG THE HAIRY EARTHMEN 



left off the game. They remem- 
bered (but conveniently, and af- 
ter they had worn out the fun 
of it) that they were forbidden 
to play Warfare with live sol- 
diers. The Eretzi, left to them- 
selves again, once more conduct- 
ed their battles as dull and unin- 
spired affairs. 

You can put it to a test, now, 
tonight. Study the conflicts of 
the earlier times, of this high 
period, and of the time the fol- 
lowed. You will see the differ- 
ence. For a short two or three 
centuries you will find really well 
contrived battles. And before and 
after there is only ineptitude. 

^>ften the Children played at 
' ' Jealousies and raised up all 
the black passions in themselves. 
They played at Immoralities, for 
there is an abiding evil in all 
children. 

Maskings and water-tarnivals 
and balls, and forever the emo- 
tional intrigue! 

Ralpha walked down a valley, 
playing a lute and wearing the 
body of somebody else. He luted 
the birds out of the trees and 
worked a charm on the whole 
countryside. 

An old crone followed him and 
called, “Love me when I’m old.” 

“Sempremai, tuttavia," sang 
Ralpha in Eretzi or Earthian. 
“For Ever, For Always.” 

A small girl followed and 

93 



called, “Love me when I’m 
young.” 

“Forever, for always,” sang 
Ralpha. 

The weirdest witch in the 
world followed him and called, 
“Love me when I’m ugly.” 

“For always, forever,” sang 
Ralpha, and pulled her down on 
the grass. He knew that all the 
creatures had been Laurie play- 
ing Bodies. 

But a peculiar thing happened : 
the prelude became more impor- 
tant than the play. Ralph fell in 
love with his own song, and for- 
got Laurie who had inspired it. 
He made all manner of music 
and poem — aubade, madrigal, 
chanson; and he topped it off 
with one hundred sonnets. He 
made them in Eretzi words, Italy 
words, Languedoc words, and 
they were excellent. And the Er- 
etzi still copy them. 

Ralpha discovered there that 
poetry and song are Passion De- 
ferred. But Laurie would rather 
have deferred the song. She was 
long gone away and taking up 
with others before Ralpha had 
finished singing his love for her, 
but he never noticed that she 
had left him. After Hobble, 
Ralpha was the most peculiar of 
them all. 

I n the meanwhile, Michael 
Goodgrind invented another 
game of Bodies. He made them 

94 



of marble — an Eretzi limestone 
that cuts easily without faulting. 
And he painted them on canvas. 
He made the People of Home, 
and the Eretzi. He said that he 
would make angels. 

“But you cannot make angels,” 
said Joan. 

“We know that,” said Michael, 
“but do the Eretzi know that I 
cannot? I will make angels for 
the Eretzi.” 

He made them grotesque, like 
chicken men, like bird men, with 
an impossible duplication of hu- 
meral function. And the Children 
laughed at the carven jokes. 

But Michael had sudden in- 
spiration. He touched his crea- 
tions up and added an element 
of nobility. So an iconography 
was born. 

All the Children did it then, 
and they carried it into other 
mediums. They made the Eretzi, 
and they made themselves. You 
can still see their deep features 
on some of those statues, that 
family look that was on them no 
matter what faces they wore or 
copied. 

Bronze is fun! Bronze horses 
are the best. Big bronze doors 
can be an orgy of delight, or 
bronze bells whose shape is their 
tone. 

The Children went to larger 
things. They played at Realms 
and Constitutions, and Banks 
and Ships and Provinces. Then 



GALAXY 



they came down to smaller things 
again and played at Books, for 
Hobble had just invented the 
printing thing. 

Of them all, Hobble had the 
least imagination. He didn’t 
range wide like the others. He 
didn’t outrage the Eretzi. He 
spent all his time with his sick 
toys as though he were a child of 
much younger years. 

The only new body he acquir- 
ed was another one just like his 
own. Even this he didn’t acquire 
as did the other Children theirs. 
He made it laboriously in his 
shop, and animated it. Hobble 
and the Hobble Creature worked 
together thereafter, and you 
could not tell them apart. One 
was as dull and laboring as the 
other. 

nphe Eretzi had no effect what- 
soever on the Children, but 
the Children had great effect on 
the Eretzi. The Children had the 
faculty of making whatever lit- 
tle things they needed or wanted, 
and the Eretzi began to copy 
them. In this manner the Eretzi 
came onto many tools, processes, 
devices and arts that they had 
never known before. Out of ten 
thousand, there were these: 

The Astrolabe, Equatorium, 
Quadrant, Lathes and Travers- 
ing Tools, Ball-Bearings, Gud- 
geons, Gig-Mills, Barometers, 
Range-Finders, Cantilever Con- 



struction, Machine-Saws, Screw- 
Jacks, Hammer-Forges and 
Drop-Forges, Printing, Steel that 
was more than puddled Iron, 
Logarithms, Hydraulic Rams, 
Screw-Dies, Spanner-Wrenches, 
Flux-Solder, Telescopes, Micro- 
scopes, Mortising Machines, 
Wire-Drawing, Stanches (Navi- 
gation-Locks), Gear Trains, Pa- 
per Making, Magnetic Compass 
and Wind-Rhumb, Portulan 
Charts and Projection Maps, 
Pinnule-Sights, Spirit-Levels, 
Fine Micrometers, Porcelain, 
Fire-Lock Guns, Music Notation 
and Music Printing, Complex 
Pulleys and Snatch-Blocks, the 
Seed-Drill, Playing Cards (the 
Children’s masquerade faces may 
still be seen on them), Tobacco, 
the Violin, Whisky, the Mechan- 
ical Clock. 

They were forbidden, of course, 
to display any second-aspect 
powers or machines, as these 
would disrupt things. But they 
disrupted accidently in build- 
ing, in tooling, in armies and 
navies, in harbors and canals, 
in towns and bridges, in ways 
of thinking and recording. They 
started a thing that couldn’t be 
reversed. It was only the One 
Afternoon they were here, only 
two or three Eretzi Centuries, but 
they set a trend. They over- 
whelmed by the very number of 
their new devices, and it could 
never be simple on Eretz again. 



AMONG THE HAIRY EARTHMEN 



95 



Hphere were many thousands 
of Eretz days and nights in 
that Long Afternoon. The Chil- 
dren had begun to tire of it, and 
the hour was growing late. For 
the last time they wandered off, 
this time all Seven of them to- 
gether. 

In the bodies of Kings and 
their Ladies, they strode down 
a High Road in the Levant. They 
were wondering what last thing 
they could contrive, when they 
found their way blocked by a 
Pilgrim with a staff. 

“Let’s tumble the hairy Eret- 
zi,” shouted Ralpha. “Let him 
not stand in the way of Kings!” 
For Ralpha was King of Bul- 
garia that day. 

But they did not tumble the 
Pilgrim. That man knew how to 
handle his staff, and he laid 
the bunch of them low. It was 
nothing to him that they were 
the high people of the World 
who ordered Nations. He flogged 
them flat. 

“Bleak Children!” that Pil- 
grim cried out as he beat them 
into the ground. “Unfledged lit- 
tle oafs! Is it so that you waste 
your Afternoon on Earth? I’ll 
give you what your Fathers for- 
got.” 

Seven-colored thunder, how he 
could use that staff! He smashed 
the gaudy bodies of the Children 
and broke many of their damn- 
able bones. Did he know that it 



didn’t matter? Did he under- 
stand that the bodies they wore 
were only for an antic? 

“Lay off, old Father!” begged 
Michael Goodgrind, bleeding and 
half beaten into the earth “Stay 
your bloody bludgeon. You do 
not know who we are.” 

“I know you,” maintained the 
Pilgrim mountainously. “You are 
ignorant Children who have 
abused the Afternoon given you 
on Earth. You have marred and 
ruined and warped everything 
you have touched.” 

“No, no,” Ralpha protested — 
as he set in new bones for his 
old damaged ones — “You do 
not understand. We have ad- 
vanced you a thousand of your 
years in one of our afternoons. 
Consider the Centuries we have 
saved you! It’s as though we 
had increased your life by that 
thousand years.” 

“We have all the time there 
is,” said the Pilgrim solidly. “We 
were well and seriously along our 
road, and it was not so crooked 
as the one you have brought us 
over. You have broken our se- 
quence with your meddling. 
You’ve set us back more ways 
than you’ve advanced us. You’ve 
shattered our Unity.” 

“Pigs have unity!” Joan shout- 
ed. “We’ve brought you diversi- 
ty. Think deep. Consider all the 
machines we have showed you, 
the building and the technique. 



96 



GALAXY 



I can name you a thousand 
things we’ve given you. You will 
never be the same again.” 
“True. We will never be the 
same,” said the Pilgrim. “You 
may not be an unmixed curse. 
I’m a plain man and I don’t 
know. Surety is one of the things 
you’ve lost us. But you befouled 
us. You played the game of Im- 
moralities and taught it to us 
earthlings.” 

“You had it already,” Laurie 
insisted. “We only brought ele- 
gance instead of piggishness to 
its practice.” Immoralities was 
Laurie’s own game, and she didn’t 
like to hear it slighted. 

“You have killed many thou- 
sands of us in your battles,” said 
the Pilgrim. You’re a bitter fruit 
— sweet at the first taste only.” 
“You would yourselves have 
killed the same numbers in bat- 
tles, and the battles wouldn’t 
have been so good,” said Mi- 
chael. “Do you not realize that 
we are the higher race? We have 
roots of great antiquity.” 

“We have roots older than an- 
tiquity,” averred the Pilgrim. 
“You are wicked Children with- 
out compassion.” 

“Compassion? For the Eretzi?” 
shouted Lonnie in disbelief. 

“Do you have compassion for 
mice?” demanded Ralpha. 

“Yes. I have compassion for 
mice,” the Pilgrim said softly. 
“I make a guess,” Ralpha shot 

AMONG THE HAIRY EARTHMEN 



in shrewdly after they had all 
repaired their damaged bodies. 
“You travel as a Pilgrim, and 
Pilgrims sometimes come from 
very far away. You are not Eret- 
zi. You are one of the Fathers 
from Home going in the guise of 
an Eretzi Pilgrim. You have this 
routine so that sometimes one of 
you comes to this world — and 
to every world — to see how it 
goes. You may have come to in- 
vestigate an event said to have 
happened on Eretz a day ago.” 

Ralpha did not mean an Eretzi 
day ago, but a day ago at Home. 
The High Road they were on was 
in Coele-Syria not far from 
where the Event was thought to 
have happened, and Ralpha pur- 
sued his point: 

“You are no Eretzi, or you 
would not dare to confront us, 
knowing what we are.” 

“You guess wrong in this and 
in everything,” said the Pilgrim. 
“I am of this Earth, earthy. And 
I will not be intimidated by a 
gangle of children of whatever 
species! You’re a weaker flesh 
than ourselves. You hide in other 
bodies, and' you get earthlings 
to do your slaughter. And you 
cannot stand up to my staff! 

“Go home, you witless wean- 
lings!” and he raised his terrible 
staff again. 

“Our time Is nearly up. We 
will be gone soon,” said Joan 
softly.

r T''he last game they played? 

They played Saints — for 
the Evil they had done in play- 
ing Bodies wrongly, and in play- 
ing Wars with live soldiers. But 
they repented of the things only 
after they had enjoyed them for 
the Long Afternoon. They played 
Saints in hair-shirt and ashes, 
and revived that affair among 
the Eretzi. 

And finally they all assembled 
and took off from the high hill 
between Prato and Firenze in 
Italy. The rocks flowed like water 
where they left, and now there 
would be a double scarp forma- 
tion. 

They were gone, and that was 
the end of them here. 

There is a theory, however, 
that one of the Hobbles re- 
mained and is with us yet. Hob- 
ble and his creature could not 
be told apart and could not fin- 
ally tell themselves apart. They 
flipped an Eretzi coin, Emper- 
ors or Shields, to see which one 
would go and which one would 
stay. One went and one stayed. 
One is still here. 

But, after all, Hobble was only 
concerned with the sick toys, the 
mechanical things, the material 
inventions. Would it have been 
better if Ralpha or Joan stayed 
with us? They’d have burned 



us crisp by now! They were 
damnable and irresponsible chil- 
dren. 

f | 'his short Historical Mono- 
graph was not assembled for 
a distraction or an amusement. 
We consider the evidence that 
Children have spent their short 
vacations here more than once 
and in both hemispheres. We set 
out the theses in ordered parell- 
els and we discover that we have 
begun to tremble unaccountably. 

When last came such visitors 
here? What thing has beset us 
during the last long Eretzi life- 
time? 

We consider a new period — 
and it impinges on the Present — 
with aspects so different from 
anything that went before that 
we can only gasp aghast and gasp 
in sick wonder: 

“Is it ourselves who behave so? 

“Is it beings of another sort, 
or have we become those beings? 

“Are we ourselves? Are these 
our deeds?” 

There are great deep faces 
looking over our shoulder, there 
are cold voices of ancient Chil- 
dren jeering “Compassion? For 
Earthlings?”, there is nasty froz- 
en laughter that does not belong 
to our species.

The Look 

by GEORGE HENRY SMITH 



Do you have trouble understanding 
women's fashions? Here's the key! 



((Ts this the place?” Sam Tay- 
A lor asked, staring at the 
rather undistinguished building 
on a side street in Paris. “It cer- 
tainly doesn’t look like much.” 
“Maybe not,” Jim Harper 
said, “but it’s the salon of the 
world’s leading style designers, 
Raymond and Anton.” 

“And you still think they’re to 
blame?” 

“You’ve seen the birth rate 
statistics,” Jim said. “You know 
what the women who follow their 
styles look like.” 

“Yes, I’ve seen the w- women,” 
Sam almost choked on the word. 



“But I just can’t see all this as 
a plot. Why would they do it?” 
“Do you remember the song 
called ‘Anatole of Paris’ that 
Danny Kaye used to do years 
ago?” Jim asked. “Remember 
how he describes all the horri- 
ble things he has done to women 
in the name of fashion, tells of 
all the incredibly ugly clothes 
he has persuaded them to wear. 
The song ends with a line ex- 
plaining why he does it. ‘I do it,’ 
he says, ‘because I hate women.’ ” 
“But, Jim, you can’t believe 
women would deliberately follow 
such ...” 



99 



“My friend, there is only one 
urge in the human female which 
is stronger than the urge to mar- 
ry and reproduce, and that is 
the urge to look exactly like 
every other woman . the ir- 
resistable impulse to follow 

fashion’s dictates.” 

“You mean like that?” Sam 
asked, nodding toward two ap- 
parently hunchbacked young 
women hobbling by on feet long 
since deformed by their needle- 
pointed shoes. 

“Yes,” Jim said. “Women are 
being led to destruction by let- 
ting themselves be made so hor- 
rible to look at that men can’t 
stand them.” 

Sam shuddered as two more 
monstrosities minced past with 
bulges in all the wrong places. 
“What can we do? We’re just 
a couple of newspaper men. If 
the governments of the world 
are helpless, what can we ex- 
pect to do?” 

“I have an idea,”' Jim said. 
“I’m going to prove to those 
two in there that no matter what 
they do to women, there will al- 
ways be some men who can 
stomach them.” 

Sam gulped. “You don’t . 
you don’t mean us?” 

“Good Lord, no!” Jim said. “I 
swore off when they brought out 
the pinhead look. But I’ve been 
looking around and asking ques- 
tions and I’ve found a guy . 



the sexiest, woman chasingest 
sailor there ever was . and 
we’ve challenged Raymond to a 
test. Jerry will be along in a 
minute and then we’ll go on in.” 

IV/Teanwhile, inside the build- 

' - * - ing, Anton and Raymond 
were in conference. 

“Now, Anton, don’t be any- 
more nasty than you have to,” 
Raymond said. “Things are going 
rather well.” 

“No, they’re not! We’ve fail- 
ed!” Anton wailed, wringing his 
hands. “In March we introduced 
the pinhead effect, and in April 
that delightful rubber lip look, 
but still ...” 

“We’ve made gains. You know 
we have.” Raymond said firm- 
ly. “We know beyond a shadow 
of a doubt that women will wear 
anything or change their physical 
appearance in any way as long 
as it’s the style.” ' 

“But we haven’t succeeded un- 
til .. ” 

“Until right now!” Raymond 
interrupted triumphantly. “Now 
we have THE LOOK. Not the 
New Look or the Sack Look or 
the Chi Chi Look, but THE 
LOOK. It is positively, absolute- 
ly the most devastating, the most 
daring thing any of us has done 
yet.” 

“I know,” Anton pouted, “but 
I can’t help feeling that ...” 

“Even you will be convinced 



100

as soon as those two horrible men 
get here with their friend.’ 
“What horrible men?” 

“Those two reporter things . 
the ones who have been writing 
all those nasty stories about our 
creations.” 

“The Americans?” 

“Yes . and they’re bringing 
a sailor with them.” 

“A sailor? Oh, how lovely!” 
Anton clapped his delicate hands 
together. 

“You behave, you hear? I’ve 
arranged a test and I don’t want 
you lousing it up.” 

“What kind of test?” 
Raymond giggled. “See the 
curtain over there? Our newest 
model is behind it, and I’ve done 
the work on her myself. Need I 
say more?” 

Anton’s eyes widened and then 
he giggled too. “You mean . ?” 
“Yes. They actually think they 
can stop us.” 

J im Harper and Sam Taylor 
entered the salon. Walking 
between them was a tall, curly- 
haired, craggy-faced young man 
in the dress blues of an Ameri- 
can sailor. 

“Here we are . uh . 
gentlemen,” Jim said confidently. 
“This is our champion, Jerry 
Blake.” 

“ Delighted to meet you, Jer- 
ry,” Raymond gushed, extending 
a limp white hand which the 



sailor ignored. 

“His shipmates call him ‘Make 
Out,’ ” Jim explained. “We’ve 
brought him here to save the 
human race from a fate worse 
than death.” 

“Oh really, it’s hardly that 
bad,” Raymond tittered. 

“For us it is,” Jim said, “but 
there are some men who will al- 
ways be able to stand women no 
matter what you do to them.” 

“And Jerry is one of those?” 
Raymond asked. 

“That’s right. Make Out, tell 
them what you think of feminine 
beauty.” 

The tall boy shrugged. “Beau- 
ty? Who needs it? As long as 
dames has got the equipment for 
the main event, who cares? I 
remember one time I met this old 
bag down in Rio, and . well, 
like the fella says, you can al- 
ways throw a flag over her face 
and do it for Old Glory.” 

“Good boy!” Sam grinned, 
slapping him on the back. 

“Is your model ready?” Jim 
asked. 

“Indeed she is,” Raymond 
said. “She’s waiting over there 
behind that curtain to show your 
friend our newest creation . 
THE LOOK.” 

“Go get ’er, Make Out!” Jim 
said. “And remember, the fate 
of mankind may depend on what 
you do now.” 

“Yes, my boy, it’s for more 

101 



THE LOOK 



than Old Glory this time,” Sam 
added. 

The sailor grinned and strode 
nonchalantly across the room and 
disappeared behind the curtain. 
Seconds later there was a chok- 
ing, retching sound and Make 
Out Jerry Blake staggered to- 
ward them, his face ashen and 
contorted with revulsion. 

“What’s the matter?” Jim de- 
manded, the color draining from 
his face. 

Jerry didn’t say a word. He 
just became violently sick on the 
luxurious carpeting of the salon 
before reeling dizzily out of the 
building. 

“I would say THE LOOK has 
everything I predicted for it,” 
Raymond said smugly. 

Jim and Sam looked at each 
other, stricken. “How long,” 
Sam asked, “do you think it 
would take for a man to drink 
himself to death?” 

“I don’t know,” Jim said 
“but let’s go find out.” 

“Oh, come now, boys,” Anton 
simpered as they moved toward 



the door. “There’s always us, you 
know.” 

“Yes, we know,” Sam said. 
“God help the human race!” 

tC"Y^hen door had closed 
behind them, Raymond 
turned to Anton. “Delicious! 
Delightful! Wasn’t that just per- 
fect?” 

“Beautiful!” Anton agreed. 
“We’ve done it! We’ve found the 
way!” 

“And the best part is, they 
still don’t know who we are or 
why we’re doing it,” Raymond 
said as he stripped off his false 
eyelashes and removed the lower 
half of his face. 

“Let’s make the call right 
now,” Anton said, lifting off his 
blonde wig to free his long, green 
tenactles. “Let’s send the alert 
message.” 

“Yes,” Raymond agreed, “Let’s 
inform Alpha Centauri that the 
planet Earth will be depopulated 
and ready for colonization with- 
in the next hundred years!”

CONCLUSION 



Heisenberg's Eyes 

by FRANK HERBERT 

Illustrated by ADKINS 



All the Earth belonged to the Optimen 
— who didn't know what to do with it! 



XVII 

T o Svengaard, raised in the or- 
dered world of the Optimen, 
the idea that they were fallible 
came as heresy. He tried to put 
it out of his mind and his ears. 
To be fallible was to be subject 
to death. Only the lower orders 
suffered thus, not the Optimen. 
How could they be fallible? 



He knew the surgeon sitting 
across from him in the pale dawn 
light that filtered through narrow 
slots in a domed ceiling. The 
man was Toure Igan, one of Cen- 
tral’s surgical elite, a person to 
whom only the most delicate 
genetico-medical problems were 
posed. 

The room they occupied was a 
tight little space stolen between 



103 



What Has Gone Before — 

For more generations than anyone could remember, the world 
had been perfectly stable — because every newborn child was genetically 
tailored to fit a certain standard pattern, so that the people at large 
were made up of replaceable parts, and their rulers, the Optimen, lived 
practically forever. 

But one unborn human embryo, hours old, threatened to destroy 
the whole millenia-old system. It was mortal . but it was also, at 
least in potentiality, a superman as potent as the Optimen themselves. 
If the new life was allowed to be born there was no telling what the 
results would be. Cautious in their immortality, the Opitmen determined 
to destroy if — 

But they could not! Someone had hidden it away! 



the walls of an air-system cap, 
servicing the subterranean war- 
rens of the Cascade Complex. 
Svengaard sat in a comfortable 
chair, but his arms and legs were 
bound. Other people were using 
the space, crowding past the little 
table where Igan sat. The people 
carried oddly shaped packages. 
For the most part they ignored 
Igan and his companion. 

Svengaard studied the dark, 
intense features of the Central 
surgeon. Crease lines in the 
man’s face betrayed the begin- 
nings of enzymic failure. He was 
starting to age. But the eyes 
were the blue of a summer sky 
and still young. 



“You must chose sides,” Igan 
had said. 

Svengaard allowed his atten- 
tion to wander. A man passed 
carrying a golden metallic ball. 
From one of his pockets protrud- 
ed a short silver chain on which 
dangled a breeder fetish in the 
shape of a lingan. 

“You must answer,” Igan said. 

Svengaard looked at the wall 
beside him — plasmeld, the in- 
evitable plasmeld. The space 
stank of disinfectants and the 
ersatz garden effect of air-puri- 
fier perfumes. 

People continued to pass 
through the narrow room. The 
sameness of their garments be- 



104 



GALAXY 



gan to weigh on Svengaard. Who 
were these people? They were 
members of the Underground, 
that was obvious. But who were 
they? 

A woman touched him, crowd- 
ing past. Svengaard looked up in- 
to a white *smile in a black face, 
recognized a Zeek female, a 
face like Potter’s but the skin 
darker ... a surgical mistake. 
She wore a bracelet of human 
hair on her right wrist. It was 
blonde hair. Svengaard stared at 
the bracelet until the woman 
rounded the curve of the room 
out of his sight. 

CCTt’s open battle now,” Igan 

A said. “You must believe me. 
Your own life depends on it.” 

My own life? Svengaard won- 
dered. He tried to think about 
his own life, identify it. He had 
a tertiary wife, little more than 
n playmate, a woman like himself 
whose every request for a breed- 
er permit had been denied. For 
a moment he couldn’t picture 
her face, lost the shape of it in 
memories of previous wives and 
playmates. 

She isn’t my life, he thought. 
Who is my life? 

He was conscious of a fatigue 
that went to the bone, and a 
hangover from the narcotics his 
captors had administered during 
the night. He remembered the 
hands seizing him, that gasping 



look into a wall that could not 
be a door but was, the lighted 
space beyond. And he remem- 
bered awakening here with Igan 
across from him. 

“I’ve held nothing back,” Igan 
said. “I’ve told you everything. 
Potter barely escaped with his 
life. The order’s already out to 
get you. Your computer nurse is 
dead. Many people have died. 
More will die. They have to be 
sure, don’t you understand? They 
can leave nothing to chance.” 
What is my life? Svengaard 
asked himself. And he thought 
now about his comfortable apart- 
ment, the artifacts and enter- 
tainment reels, the reference 
works, his friends, the safely or- 
dinary routine of his position. 
“But where would I go?” 
“A place has been prepared.” 
“No place is safe from them” 
Svengaard said. In saying this, he 
sensed for the first time the 
depth of his own resentment 
against the Optimen. 

“Many places are safe,” Igan 
said. “ They merely pretend to 
supersensual perception. Their 
real powers lie in machines and 
instruments, the secret surveil- 
lance. But machines and instru- 
ments can be twisted to other 
purposes. And the Optimen de- 
pend on Folk to do their vio- 
lence.” 

Svengaard shook his head. 
“This is all nonsense.” 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



105 



“Except for one thing,” Igan 
said, “they are as we — variously 
human. We know this from ex- 
perience.” 

“But why would they do these 
things you accuse them of?” 
Svengaard protested. “It’s not 
sensible. They’re good to us.” 

“Their sole interest is in main- 
taining themselves,” Igan said. 
“They walk a tightrope. As long 
as there’s no significant change 
in their environment, they’ll con- 
tinue living . indefinitely. Let 
significant change creep into 
their lives and they are like us 
— subject to the whims of nature. 
For them, you see, there can be 
no nature — no nature they don’t 
control.” 

“I don’t believe it,” Svengaard 
said. “They’re the ones who love 
us and care for us. Look at all 
they’ve done for us.” 

“I have looked.” Igan shook 
his head. Svengaard was being 
more pig-headed than they’d ex- 
pected. He screened out con- 
trary evidence and stuck to the 
old formulas. 

“You want them to succumb,” 
Svengaard accused. “Why do you 
want this?” 

“Because they’ve deprived us 
of evolution,” Igan said. 

Qvengaard stared at him. 
►3 “What?” 

“They’ve made themselves the 
only free individuals in our 

106 



world,” Igan said. “But individ- 
uals don’t evolve. Populations 
evolve, not individuals. We have 
no population.” 

“But the Folk . .” 

“Yes, the Folk! Who among 
us are allowed to mate?” Igan 
shook his head. “You’re a gene 
surgeon, man! Haven’t you iden- 
tified the pattern yet?” 

“Pattern? What pattern? What 
do you mean?” Svengaard 
pushed himself up in the chair, 
cursed his bindings. His arms and 
legs felt numb. 

“The Optimen hold to one 
cardinal rule of mating,” Igan 
said. “Return to the standard 
average. They allow a random 
interchange with the standard 
average organism to suppress de- 
velopment of unique individuals. 
Such few unique individuals as 
occur are not allowed to breed.” 
Svengaard shook his head. “I 
don’t believe you,” he said. But 
he could feel the beginnings of 
doubt. His own case — no matter 
which mate he Chose, the breed- 
ing permit was denied. He’d ex- 
amined the genetic matchings 
himself, had seen configurations 
he would’ve sworn were viable — 
but the Optimen said no. 

“You do believe me,” Igan 
said. 

“But look at the long lives 
they give us,” Svengaard said. 
“I can expect almost two hun- 
dred years.” 



GALAXY 



“Medicine does that, not the 
Optimen,” Igan said. “Delicate, 
careful refinement of the enzy- 
mic prescription’s the key. That 
plus a prescribed life in which 
emotional upset is held to a 
minimum. Selected exercises and 
a diet chosen for your specific 
needs. It could be done for al- 
most anyone.” 

“Indefinite life?” Svengaard 
whispered. 

“No! But long life, much long- 
er than we get now. I’m going 
on four hundred years, myself — 
as are several of my contempor- 
aries. Almost four hundred love- 
ly years,” he said, remembering 
Calapine’s vicious phrase . 
and Nourse’s chuckle. 

“Four hundred — you?” Sven- 
gaard asked. 

“I agree it’s nothing compared 
to their many thousands,” Igan 
said. But almost anyone could 
have these years, except they 
don’t permit it.” 

“Why?” Svengaard asked. 

“This way they can offer the 
bonus years to the selected few,” 
Igan said, “ — a reward for serv- 
ice. Without this rule they have 
no coin to buy us. You knew 
this! You’ve been trying to sell 
yourself to them for this coin 
all your life.” 

S vengaard looked down at his 
bound hands. Is that my 
life? he wondered. Fettered 



hands? Who will buy my fettered 
hands? 

“And you should hear Nourse 
chuckle at my pitiful four hun- 
dred years,” Igan said. 

“Nourse?” 

“Yes! Nourse of the Tuyere, 
Nourse the Cynic, Nourse of the 
more than forty thousand years!” 

“I’ve seen Nourse,” Igan said. 

“Why do you think Nourse is 
a Cynic?” Igan demanded. 
“There’re older Optimen, much 
older. Most of those aren’t Cyn- 
ics.” 

“I don’t understand,” Sven- 
gaard said. He stared at Igan, 
feeling weak, battered, unable to 
counter the force of these words 
and arguments. 

“I forget you’re not of Cen- 
tral,” Igan said. “They classify 
themselves by the tiny bit of 
emotion they’re permitted. 
They’re Actionists, Emotionals, 
Cynics, Hedonists and Effetes. 
They pass through cynicism on 
their way to hedonism. The Tuy- 
ere already’s well occupied in 
pursuit of personal pleasure. 
There’s a pattern here, too, and 
none of it’s good.” 

Igan studied Svengaard, 
weighing the effect of his words. 
Here was a creature barely above 
the Folk. He was medieval man. 
To him, Central and the Optimen 
were the “Primum Mobile” in 
control of all celestial systems. 
Beyond Central lay only the 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



107 



Empyrean home of the Creator 
. and for the Svengaards of 
the world there was little dis- 
tinction between Optiman and 
Creator. Both were higher than 
the moon and totally without 
fault. 

“Where can we run?” Sven- 
gaard asked. “There’s no place 
to hide. They control the enzy- 
mic prescriptions. The minute 
one of us walks into a pharmacy 
for renewal, that’s the end.” 

“We have our sources,” Igan 
said. 

“But why would you want 
me?” Svengaard asked. He kept 
his eyes on his bindings. 

“Because you’re a unique in- 
dividual,” Igan said. “Because 
Potter wants you. Because you 
know of the Durant embryo.” 

The Durant embryo, Sven- 
gaard thought. What’s the sig- 
nificance of the Durant embryo? 
It all comes back to that embryo. 

He looked up, met Igan’s eyes. 

“You find it difficult to see the 
Optimen in my description of 
them,” Igan said. 

“Yes.” 

“They’re a plague on the face 
of the earth,” Igan said. “They’re 
the earth’s disease!” 

Svengaard recoiled from the 
bitterness of Igan’s voice. 

“Saul has erased his thousands 
and David his ten thousands,” 
Igan said. “But the Optimen 
erase the future.” 

108 



\ blocky hulk of a man 
squeezed past the narrow 
space beside the table, planted 
himself with his back to Sven- 
gaard. 

“Well?” he asked. The voice 
carried a disturbing tone of ur- 
gency, just in that one word. 
Svengaard tried to see the face, 
but couldn’t move far enough to 
the side. There was just that wide 
belted back in a gray jacket. 

“I don’t know,” Igan said. 

“We can spare no more time,” 
the newcomer said. “Potter has 
completed his work.” 

“The result?” Igan asked. 

“He says successful. He used 
enzymic injection for quick re- 
covery. The mother will be ready 
to move soon.” A thick hand 
moved over the shoulder to point 
a thumb at Svengaard. “What do 
we do with him?” 

“Bring him,” Igan said. 
“What’s Central doing?” 

“Ordered arrest and confine- 
ment of every surgeon.” 

“So soon? Did they get Dr. 
Hand?” 

“Yes, but he took the black 
door.” 

“Stopped his heart,” Igan said. 
“The only thing. We can’t let 
them question one of us. How 
many does that leave us?” 
“Seven?” 

“Including Svengaard?” 

“Eight then.” 

“We’ll keep Svengaard re- 

GALAXY 



strained for the time being,” Igan 
said. 

“They’re beginning to pull 
their special people out of Sea- 
tac,” the big man said. 

Svengaard could see only half 
of Igan’s face past the newcom- 
er, but that half showed a deep 
frown of concentration. The one 
visible eye looked at Svengaard, 
disregarded him. 

“It’s obvious,” Igan said. 

“Yes — they’re going to destroy 
the megalopolis.” 

“Not destroy sterilize.” 

“You’ve heard Allgood speak 
of the Folk?” 

“Many times. Vermin in their 
warrens. He’ll step on the entire 
region without a qualm. Is every- 
thing ready to move?” 

“Ready enough.” 

“The driver?” 

“Programmed for the desired 
response.” 

“Give Svengaard a shot to 
keep him quiet, then. We won’t 
have time for him once we’re on 
the road.” 

Svengaard stiffened. 

The bulky back turned. Sven- 
gaard looked up into a pair of 
glistening eyes, gray, measuring, 
devoid of emotion. One of the 
thick hands lifted, carrying a 
springshot ampule. The hand 
touched his neck and there was a 
jolt. 

Svengaard stared up at that 
faceless face while the fuzzy 



clouds closed around his mind. 
His throat felt thick, tongue use- 
less. He willed himself to protest, 
but no sound came. Awareness 
became a tightening globe cen- 
tered on a tiny patch of ceiling 
with slotted openings. The scene 
condensed, smaller and smaller — 
a frantic circle like an eye with 
slotted pupils. 

He sank into a cushioned well 
of darkness. 

XVIII 

T izbeth lay on a bench with 

' Harvey seated beside her, 
steadying her. There were five 
people here in a cubed space no 
bigger than a large packing box. 
The box had been fitted into the 
center of a normal load on an 
overland transporter van. A 
single glowtube in the corner 
above her head illuminated the 
interior with a sickly yellow 
light. She could see Doctors 
Igan and Boumour on a rough 
bench opposite her, their feet 
stretched across the bound, 
gagged and unconscious figure of 
Svengaard on the floor. 

It was already night outside, 
Harvey had said. That must 
mean they’d come a goodly dis- 
tance, she thought. She felt vag- 
uely nauseated and her abdomen 
ached around the stitches. The 
thought of carrying her son with- 
in her carried a strange reassur- 



HEISENBERG'S EYES

ance. There was a sense of ful- 
fillment in it. Potter had said 
she likely could do without her 
regular enzymes while she carried 
the embryo. He’d obviously been 
thinking the embryo would be 
removed into a vat when they 
reached a safe place. But she 
knew she’d resist that. She want- 
ed to carry her son full term. No 
woman had done that for thou- 
sands of years, but she wanted it. 

“We’re picking up speed,” 
Igan said. “We must be out of 
the tubes onto the skyway.” 

“Will there be check points?” 
Boumour asked. 

“Bound to be.” 

Harvey sensed the accuracy of 
Igan’s assessment. Speed? Yes — 
their bodies were compensating 
for heavier pressure on the turns. 
Air was coming in a bit faster 
through the scoop ventilator un- 
der Lizbeth’s bench. There was 
a new hardness to the ground- 
effect suspension, less bounce. 
The turbines echoed loudly in 
the narrow box, and he could 
smell unburned hydrocarbons. 

Check points? Security would 
use every means to see that no 
one escaped Seatac. He wondered 
then what was about to happen 
to the megalopolis. The surgeons 
had spoken of poison gas in the 
ventilators, sonics. Central had 
many weapons, they said. Harvey 
put out an arm to hold Lizbeth 
as they rounded a sharp corner. 



He didn’t know how he felt 
about Lizbeth carrying their son 
within her. It was odd. Not ob- 
scene or disgusting . just odd. 
An instinctive response had come 
to focus within him, and he 
looked around for dangers from 
which he could protect her. But 
there was only this box filled 
with the smell of stale sweat and 
oil. 

“What’s the cargo around us?” 
Boumour asked. 

“Odds and ends,” Igan said. 
“Machinery parts, some old art 
works, inconsequential things. We 
took anything we could pirate to 
make a seemingly normal load.” 

Inconsequentials, Harvey 
thought. He found himself fas- 
cinated by this revelation. Incon- 
sequentials. They carried parts to 
things that might never be built. 

L izbeth’s hand groped out, 
found his. “Harvey?” 

He bent over her. “Yes, dear?” 
“I feel . so . funny.” 
Harvey cast a despairing look 
at the doctors. 

“She’ll be all right,” Igan said. 
“Harvey, I’m afraid,” she said. 
“We’re not going to get through.” 
“That’s no way to talk.” Igan 
said. 

She looked up, found the gene 
surgeon studying her across the 
narrow space of the box. His eyes 
were a pair of glittering instru- 
ments in a slim, supercilious face.

is he a Cyborg,, too? she won- 
dered. The cold way the eyes 
stared at her broke through her 
control. 

“I don’t care about myself!” 
she hissed. “But what about my 
son?” 

“Best calm yourself, madam,” 
Igan said. 

“I can’t,” she said. “We’re not 
going to make it!” 

“That’s no way to act,” Igan 
said. “Our driver is the finest Cy- 
borg available.” 

“He’ll never get us past them,” 
she moaned. 

“You’d best be quiet,” Igan 
said. 

Harvey at last had an object 
from which to protect his wife. 
“Don’t talk to her that way!” he 
barked. 

Igan spoke in a long-suffering 
tone: “Not you too, Durant. 

Keep your voice down. You know 
as well as I do they’ll have listen- 
ing stations along the skyway. 
We shouldn’t be speaking now 
unless it’s absolutely necessary.” 

“Nothing can get past them 
tonight,” Lizbeth whispered. 

“Our driver is little more than 
a shell of flesh around a reflex 
computer,” Igan said. “He’s pro- 
grammed for just this task. He’ll 
get us through if anyone can.” 

“If anyone can,” she whisper- 
ed. She began to sob — wracking, 
convulsive movements that shook 
her whole body. 

112 



“See what you’ve done!” Har- 
vey said. 

Igan sighed, brought up a hand 
containing a capsule, extended 
the capsule to Harvey. “Give her 
this.” 

“What’s that?” Harvey de- 
manded. 

“Just a sedative.” 

“I don’t want a sedative,” she 
sobbed. 

“It’s for your own good, my 
dear,” Igan said. “Really this 
could dislodge the embryo. You 
should remain calm and quiet 
this soon after the operation.” 

“She doesn’t want it,” Harvey 
said. His eyes glared with anger. 

“She has to take it,” Igan said. 

“Not if she doesn’t want it.” 

I gan forced his voice into a rea- 
sonable tone. “Durant, I’m 
only trying to save our lives. 
You’re angry now and you . .” 
“You’re damn right I’m angry! 
I’m tired of being ordered 
around!” 

“If I’ve offended you, I’m 
sorry Durant,” Igan said. “But I 
must caution you that your pres- 
ent reaction is conditioned by 
your gene shaping. You’ve excess 
male protectiveness. Your wife 
will be all right. This sedative is 
harmless. She’s hysterical be- 
cause she has too much maternal 
drive. These are flaws in your 
gene shaping, but you’ll both be 
all right if you remain calm.” 

GALAXY 



“Who says we’re flawed?” 
Harvey demanded. “I’ll bet 
you’re a Sterrie who’s never . 

“That’s quite enough, Durant,” 
the other doctor said. It was a 
rumbling, powerful voice. 

Harvey looked at Boumour, 
noted the pinched-up elfin face 
on the big body. The surgeon 
appeared powerful and danger- 
ous, the face strangely inhuman. 

“We cannot fight among our- 
selves,” Boumour rumbled. “We 
may be getting near the check 
point. They’re sure to have lis- 
tening devices.” 

“We aren’t flawed,” Harvey 
growled. 

“Perhaps you’re right,” Igan 
said. “But you’re both reducing 
our chances of escape. If one of 
you breaks up at that check 
point, that’s the end of us.” He 
shifted his hand, extended the 
capsule to Lizbeth. “Please take 
this, madame. It contains a tran- 
quilizer. Quite harmless, I assure 
you.” 

Hesitantly, Lizbeth took the 
capsule. It felt cold and gelatin- 
ous against her fingers — repul- 
sive. She wanted to hurl the thing 
at Igan, but Harvey touched her 
cheek. 

“Maybe you’d better take it,” 
he said. “For the baby.” 

She brought up her hand, 
popped the capsule against the 
back of her tongue, gulped it. It 
must be all right if Harvey 



agreed. But she didn’t like the 
hurt, baffled look in his eyes. 

“Now relax,” Igan said. “It’s 
fast acting — three or four min- 
utes and you’ll feel quite calm.” 
He sat back, glanced down at 
Svengaard. The trussed figure 
still appeared to be unconscious, 
chest rising and falling in an even 
rhythm. 

TT'or what felt like a long time 
now, Svengaard had been 
increasingly aware of hunger and 
a swooping, turning motion that 
rolled his body against a hard 
surface. There was a sensation of 
swiftness about the motion. He 
smelled human perspiration, 
heard the roar of turbines. The 
sound was beginning to press on 
his consciousness. There was 
light, dim and fuzzy, through un- 
cooperative eyelids. He felt a gag 
biting his lips, bindings on hands 
and feet. 

Svengaard opened his eyes. 

For a moment he failed to 
focus. Then he found himself 
staring up at a low ceiling, a tiny 
glowtube in the corner with a 
speaker grill beneath it bulging 
beside a dull ruby call light. The 
ceiling seemed too close to him, 
and there was a blurred shadow 
shape to his right. A leg stretched 
across him. The single light emit- 
ted a yellow glow that almost 
failed to dispel the darkness. 

The ruby light began winking, 

113 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



red fire flashing on and off. 

“Check point!” Igan hissed. 
“Silence everyone!” 

They sensed the van begin to 
slow. Its air suspension became 
softer and softer. The turbines 
whined downscale. They rocked 
to a stop, and the turbines whis- 
pered into stand-by. 

Svengaard’s gaze darted 
around the enclosure. A rough 
bench above him to his right . 
two figures seated on it. A sharp 
edge of metal protruded from 
the bench support beside his 
cheek. Softly, gently, Svengaard 
moved his head toward the metal 
projection, felt it touch flesh 
through the gag. He gave a gentle 
push of his head upward, and the 
gag pulled down slightly. The 
projection scratched his cheek, 
but he ignored it. Another gentle 
tug and the gag lowered another 
fraction of a millimeter. He 
turned his eyes, checking his sur- 
roundings, saw Lizbeth’s face 
above him to the left, her eyes 
closed, hands in front of her 
mouth. There was a sense of sus- 
pended terror about her. 

Again, Svengaard moved his 
head. 

There were voices somewhere 
in a remote distance — sharp 
sounds of questions, murmurous 
answers. 

Lizbeth’s hands lowered to re- 
veal her mouth. The lips moved 
soundlessly. 



The sound of talking had 
stopped. 

Slowly the van began to move. 
Svengaard twisted his head. 
The binding of his gag broke 
free. He coughed it from his 
mouth, shouted: “Help! Help! 
I’m a prisoner! Help!” 

I gan and Boumour leaped with 
shock. Lizbeth screamed : 
“No! Oh, no!” 

Harvey surged forward, 
crashed a fist into Svengaard’s 
jaw, fell on him with one hand 
over the man’s mouth. They held 
their positions in an agony of 
listening as the van continued to 
gather speed. 

Igan took a trembling breath, 
looked across into the wide star- 
ing eyes of Lizbeth. 

The voice of their driver came 
through the speaker grill: “What 
is the trouble? Can’t you observe 
the simplest precautions?” 

The dispassionate, accusing 
quality of the voice chilled Har- 
vey. He wondered about the 
driver then, why the creature 
took this tone rather than telling 
them if they’d been exposed. 
Svengaard felt limp and uncon- 
scious beneath him, Harvey real- 
ized. He experienced a wild de- 
sire to throttle the surgeon here 
and now, could almost feel his 
hands around the man’s throat. 

“Did they hear us?” Igan whis- 
pered. 



114 



GALAXY 



“Apparently not,” the driver 
rasped. “No sign of pursuit. I 
presume you’ll not permit an- 
other such lapse. Please report 
on what happened.” 

“Svengaard wakened from the 
narcotic sooner than we expect- 
ed.” 

“But he was gagged.” 

“He . managed to get the 
gag off . somehow.” 

“Perhaps you should kill him. 
Obviously he will not take re- 
conditioning.” 

Harvey pushed himself off 
Svengaard. Now that the Cyborg 
had made the suggestion, he no 
longer felt like killing Svengaard. 
Who was it up there in the van’s 
cab? Harvey wondered. Cyborgs 
tended to sound alike, that com- 
puter personality with its altitude 
of logic so far above the human. 
This one, though, came through 
even more remote than usual. 

“We’ll . consider what to 
do,” Igan said. 

“Svengaard is again secure?” 
“He’s been taken care of.” 
“No thanks to you,” Harvey 
said, staring at Igan. “You were 
right over him.” 

Igan’s face paled. He remem- 
bered his frozen immobility after 
that leap of fear. Anger surged 
through him. What right had this 
clod to question a surgeon? He 
spoke stiffly: “I regret that I’m 
not a man of violence.” 

“Something you’d better 



learn,” Harvey said. He felt Liz- 
beth’s hand on his shoulder, al- 
lowed her to guide him back 
onto their bench. “If you have 
more of that knockout stuff, 
maybe you’d better use another 
dose of it on him before he wakes 
up again.” 

Igan suppressed a sharp reply. 

“In the bag under our bench,” 
Boumour said. “A reasonable 
suggestion.” 

Woodenly, Igan groped for a 
slapshot, administered it to Sven- 
gaard. 

A gain the driver’s voice barked 
through the speaker: “At- 
tention! We must not presume 
from the lack of immediate and 
obvious pursuit that they failed 
to hear the outcry. I am execut- 
ing Plan Gamma.” 

“Who is that driver?” Harvey 
whispered. 

“I didn’t see which one they 
programmed,” Boumour said. He 
studied Harvey. That had been 
an appropriate question. The 
driver did sound odd, much more 
so than the usual Cyborg ab- 
normality. They’d said the driver 
would be a programmed reflex 
computer, a machine designed to 
give the surest response to 
achieve their escape. Who did 
they choose for that program? 

“What’s Plan Gamma?” Liz- 
beth whispered. 

“We’re abandoning the pre- 

115 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



pared escape route,” Boumour 
said. He stared at the forward 
wall of their box. Abandoning 
the prepared route . which 
meant they’d be completely de- 
pendent now upon the abilities of 
the Cyborg driver . and which- 
ever scattered cells of the Un- 
derground remained and were 
available. Any one of those cells 
could’ve been compromised, of 
course. Boumour’s usually stolid 
nature began to entertain odd 
wisps of fear. 

“Driver!” Harvey called. 

“Silence,” the driver snapped. 

“Stick to the original plan,” 
Harvey said. “They have the 
medical facilities there if my 
wife . .” 

“Your wife’s safety is not the 
overriding factor,” the driver 
said. “Elements along the pre- 
pared route must not be discov- 
ered. Do not distract me with 
your objections. Plan Gamma is 
being executed.” 

“Easy does it,” Boumour said 
as Harvey surged forward, sup- 
porting himself with a hand on 
the bench. “What can you do, 
Durant?” 

Harvey sagged back onto the 
bench, groped for and found Liz- 
beth’s hand. She squeezed it, sig- 
naled : “Wait. Don’t you read the 
doctors? They’re frightened too 
. and worried.” 

“I’m worried about you,” Har- 
vey signaled. 

116 



So her safety — and presumably 
ours — aren’t the overriding con- 
cern, Boumour thought. What 
then is the overriding concern? 
What program controls our com- 
puter-in-ilesh? 

XIX 

Y Artly Nourse of the Tuyere oc- 
cupied a throne in the Sur- 
vey Globe, his attention on the 
rays, the winking lights and 
gauges, the cascading lumines- 
cences that reported affairs of 
the Folk. A telltale told him it 
was night outside in this hemis- 
phere — darkness that spread 
across the land from Seatac to 
the megalopolis of N’Scotia. He 
saw the physical darkness as a 
sign of frightening events to come 
and wished Schruille and Cala- 
pine would return. 

The visual-report screen came 
alight. Nourse turned to face it 
as Allgood’s features appeared 
there. The Security boss bowed 
to Nourse. 

“What is it?” Nourse asked. 

“Seatac Checkpoint East re- 
ports a van with an odd load of 
containers has just gone through, 
Nourse. Its turbines carried 
masking mutes which we deci- 
phered. The mutes concealed 
sounds of breathing — five per- 
sons hidden in the load. Voices 
cried out from within as the van 
pulled away. Acting on your in- 



GALAXY 



structions, we put a drop mark- 
er onto the van and now have it 
under observation. What are your 
orders?” 

It begins, Nourse thought. 
While I’m alone here it begins. 

Nourse looked to the instru- 
ments covering the checkpoints. 
Seatac East. The van was a mov- 
ing green pinpoint on a screen. 
He read the banked binaries de- 
scribing the incident, compared 
them with a total-plan motiva- 
tional analysis. The probability 
analogues he derived filled him 
with a sense of doom. 

“The voices have been identi- 
fied, Nourse,” Allgood said. “The 
voice prints were . 

“Svengaard and Lizbeth Dur- 
ant,” Nourse said. 

“Where she is, her husband 
cannot be far away,” Allgood 
said. 

Allgood’s logical little an- 
nouncements began to annoy 
Nourse. He contained the emo- 
tion while noting the man had 
overlooked the use of the Opti- 
man’s name-in-address. It was a 
small sign, but significant, es- 
pecially when Allgood appeared 
not to notice his own lapse. 

“Which leaves us two unidenti- 
fied,” Nourse said. 

“We can make an educated 
guess . Nourse.” 

Nourse glanced at his probabil- 
ity analogues, said: “Two of our 
wayward pharmacists.” 



“One may be Potter, Nourse.” 
Nourse shook his head. “Pot- 
ter remains in Seatac.” 

“They may have a portable 
vat, Nourse, and that embryo 
with them,” Allgood said, “but 
we failed to detect appropriate 
machinery.” 

“You would not hear the ma- 
chinery being used,” Nourse said. 
“Or, hearing it, you would not 
identify it.” 

■VTourse looked up to the banks 
^ of scanners — every one of 
them alive — showing the Qpti- 
men observing their Survey 
Globe. Night or day, the watch- 
ing channels were jammed. They 
know what I mean, he thought. 
Are they disgusted, or is this just 
another interesting aspect of 
violence? 

As could have been predicted, 
Allgood said: “I fail to under- 
stand Nourse’s meaning.” 

“No need,” Nourse said. He 
looked at the face in the screen. 
So young it appeared, but 
Nourse had begun to notice a 
thing: There was much young- 
ness in Central, but no youth. 
Even the Sterrie servants be- 
trayed this fact to the unveiled 
eye. He felt himself to be like 
the Sterrie Folk suddenly, watch- 
ing each other for evidence of 
aging, hoping by comparison 
that their own appearance pros- 
pered.

“What are Nourse’s instruc- 
tions?” Allgood asked. 

“Svengaard’s outcry indicates 
he’s a prisoner,” Nourse said. 
“But we must not overlook the 
possibility this is an elaborate 
ruse.” 

“Shall we destroy the van, 
Nourse?” 

“Destroy . Nourse shud- 
dered. “No! Not yet. Keep it 
under surveillance. Put out a gen- 
eral alert. We must discover 
where they’re headed. Every con- 
tact they make must be noted 
and marked down for attention.” 

“If they elude us. Nourse, it 
could . .” 

“You’ve flagtapped the ap- 
propriate enzyme prescriptions?” 

“Yes, Nourse.” 

“Then they cannot run far . 
or long.” 

“As you say, Nourse.” 

“You may go,” Nourse said. 

He watched the screen long af- 
ter it had turned blank. Destroy 
the van? That would be an end- 
ing. He felt then that he did not 
want this game to end — ever. A 
curious feeling of elation crept 
through him. 

T he globe’s entrance segment 
swung below him. Calapine 
entered, followed by Schruille. 
They rode the climbing beam to 
their seats on the triangular dais. 
Neither spoke. They appeared 
withdrawn, oddly calm. Nourse 



thought of a controlled storm as 
he looked at them — the light- 
ning and the thunder contained 
so that it might not harm their 
fellows. 

“Is it not time?” Calapine 
asked. 

A sigh escaped Nourse. 

Schruille activated the sensor 
contact with the scanners in the 
mountains. There was moon- 
light suddenly in the receiving 
screens, the sounds of nightbirds, 
a rustling of dry leaves. Far off 
across moon-frosted hills lay 
lines and patches of lights trac- 
ing the coast and harbors of the 
megalopolis and the multi-level 
skyway networks. 

Calapine stared at the scene, 
thinking of jewels and casual 
baubles, the playthings of idle- 
ness. She’d not had the inclina- 
tion in several centuries to in- 
dulge in such toys. Why should 
I think of them now? she won- 
dered. These are not toys. 

Nourse examined the binary 
pyramids, the action analogues 
showing the course of Folk ac- 
tivity within the megalopolis. 

“All is normal . and in readi- 
ness,” he said. 

“Normal!” Schruille said. 

“Which of us?” Calapine whis- 
pered. 

“I have seen the necessity 
longest,” Schruille said. “I will do 
it.” He rolled a looping ring in 
the arm of his throne. 



118 



GALAXY 



As he moved it, he was appall- 
ed by the simplicity of the action. 
This ring and the powers it con- 
trolled had been at hand for 
eons, an unsensitive linkage of 
machinery. All it took was a sim- 
ple turning motion, a hand and 
the will behind the hand. 

Calapine watched the scene in 
her screens — moonlight on hills, 
the megalopolis beyond, an ani- 
mated toy subject to her whims. 
The last cadre of special person- 
nel had departed, she knew. Ir- 
replaceable objects that might be 
damaged had been removed. All 
was ready and doomed. 

Winking flares began to appear 
through the necklaces of light — 
golden yellow flares. The 
Tuyere’s screens blurred as sonics 
vibrated the distant scanners. 
Lights began going out. Across 
the entire region, the lights went 
out — in groups and one by one. 
A low green fog rolled across the 
scene, filling in the valleys, over- 
running the hills. 

"presently no lights were visible. 
-*• Only the green fog remained. 
It continued to creep out be- 
neath the impersonal moon, mov- 
ing out and across and through 
until it remained and nothing 
more. 

Schruille watched the stacked 
numerical analogues, the unemo- 
tional reporters which merely 
counted, submitted deductions of 



sortings, remainders . zeroes. 
Nothing showed Folk dying in 
the tubes and warrens, in the 
streets ... at their labors ... at 
their play. 

Nourse sat weeping. 

They are dead, all dead, he 
thought. Dead. The word felt 
peculiar in his mind, devoid of 
personal meaning. It was a term 
that could be applied to bacteria 
perhaps ... or to weeds. One 
sterilized an area before bringing 
in lovely flowers. Why do 
I weep? He tried to remember if 
he’d ever wept before. Perhaps 
there was a time when I wept, he 
thought. But it was so long ago. 
Ago . ago . ago . time 
. time . wept . wept. 
They were words suddenly with- 
out meaning. That’s the trouble 
with endless life, he thought. 
With too much repetition, every- 
thing loses meaning. 

Schruille studied the green fog 
in his screens. A few repairs, and 
we’ll be able to send in new 
Folk, he thought. We’ll repopu- 
late with Folk of a safer cut. He 
wondered then where they’d find 
the safer Folk. The globe’s an- 
alysis boards revealed that the 
Seatac problem was only one of 
many such pockets. Symptoms 
were everywhere the same. 

He could see the flaw. It cen- 
tered on the isolation of one 
generation from another. Lack of 
traditions and continuity became 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



119 



an obsession with the Folk . 
because they seemed to com- 
municate no matter what re- 
pressions were tried. Folk sayings 
would crop up to reveal the deep 
current beneath. 

Schruille quoted to himself: 
“When God first created a dis- 
satisfied man, He put that man 
outside Central.” 

But we created these Folk, 
Schruille thought. How did we 
create dissatisfied men? 

He turned then and saw that 
Calapine and Nourse were weep- 
ing. 

“Why do you weep?” Schruille 
demanded. 

But they remained silent.

\ X There the last skyway ended, 
’ ’ the van took the turn away 
from the undermountain tube 
and held to the wide surface 
track on the Lester by-way. It 
led upward through old tunnels 
to the wilderness reserve and 
breeder-leave resorts along an al- 
most deserted air-blasted road- 
bed. There were no slavelights 
up here — only the moon and 
the stabbing cyclops beam of 
the van’s headlight. 

An occasional omnibus passed 
them on the downtrack, the pas- 
senger seats occupied by silent, 
moody couples, their breeder 
leave ended, heading back to the 



megalopolis. If any of them fo- 
cused on the van, it was dis- 
missed as a supply carrier for 
the resorts. 

On a banked curve below the 
Homish Resort Complex, the 
Cyborg driver made a series of 
adjustments to his lift controls. 
Venturis narrowed. Softness went 
out of the ride. Turbines whined 
upward to a near destructive 
keening. The van turned off the 
roadbed. 

Within the narrow box that 
concealed them, Harvey Durant 
clutched the bench with one hand 
and Lizbeth with the other as 
the van lurched and bounced 
across the eroded mounds of an 
ancient railroad right of way, 
crashed through a screen of alders 
and turned onto a game track 
that followed the right of way 
upward through buck brush and 
rhododendrons. 

“What’s happening?” Lizbeth 
wailed. 

The driver’s voice rasped 
through the speaker: “We have 
left the road. There is nothing to 
fear.” 

Nothing to fear, Harvey 
thought. The idea appeared so 
ludicrous he had to suppress a 
chuckle which he realized might 
be near hysteria. 

The driver had turned off all 
exterior lights and was relying 
now on the moon and his infra- 
red vision. 



120 



GALAXY 



The cyborg-boosted vision re- 
vealed the trail as a snail track 
through the brush. The van gulp- 
ed this track for two kilometers, 
leaving a dusty, leaf-whirling 
wake to a point where the game 
trail intersected a forest patrol 
road — a cleared track matted 
with dead salal and bracken from 
the passage of the patrol ve- 
hicles. Here, it turned right like 
a great hissing prehistoric mon- 
ster, labored up a hill, roared 
down the other side and to the 
other side and to the top of 
another hill where it stopped. 

Turbines whined down to 
silence, and the van settled onto 
its skids. The driver emerged, a 
blocky stub-legged figure with 
glittering prosthetic arms at- 
tached for its present needs. A 
side panel was ripped off and 
the Cyborg began unloading car- 
go, tossing it indiscriminately 
down through a stand of hemlock 
into a deep gully. 

XXrithin their compartment, 
Y " Igan lurched to his feet, 
put his mouth near the speaker- 
phone and whispered: “Where 
are we?” 

Silence. 

“That was stupid,” Harvey 
said. “How do you know why 
he’s stopped?” 

Igan ignored the insult. It 
came after all from a semi-edu- 
cated dolt. “You can hear him 



shifting cargo,” Igan said. He 
leaned across Harvey, pounded a 
palm against the compartment’s 
side. “Whats ’going on?” 

“Oh, sit down,” Harvey said. 
He put a hand on Igan’s chest, 
pushed. The surgeon stumbled 
backward onto the opposite 
bench. 

Igan started to bounce back, 
his face dark, eyes glaring. Bou- 
mour restrained him, rumbled : 
“Serenity, friend Igan.” 

Igan settled back. Slowly, a 
look of patience came over his 
features. “It’s odd,” he said, 
“how one’s emotions have a way 
of asserting themselves in spite 
of . .” 

“That will pass,” Boumour 
said. 

Harvey found Lizbeth’s hand, 
clutched it, signaled: “Igan’s 

chest — it’s convex and hard as 
plasmeld. I felt it under his 
jacket.” 

“You think he’s Cyborg?” 
“He breathes normally.” 

“And he has emotions. I read 
fear on him.” 

“Yes ... but . .” 

“We will be careful.” 

Boumour said: “You should 
place more trust in us, Durant. 
Doctor Igan had deduced that 
our driver would not be moving 
cargo unless certain sounds were 
safe.” 

“How do we know who’s mov- 
ing cargo?” Harvey asked. 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



121 



A look of caution fled across 
Boumour’s massive calm. 

Harvey read it, smiled. 

“Harvey!” Lizbeth said. “You 
don’t think the . 

“It’s our driver out there,” 
Harvey reassured her. “I can 
smell the wilderness in the air. 
There’s been no sound of a 
struggle. One doesn’t take a Cy- 
borg without a struggle.” 

“But where are we?” she 
asked. 

“In the mountains, the wilder- 
ness,” Harvey said. “From the 
feel of the ride, we’re well off 
the main by-ways.” 

Abruptly, their compartment 
lurched, slid sideways. The sin- 
gle light was extinguished. 

In the sudden darkness, the 
wall behind Harvey dropped 
away. He clutched Lizbeth, 
Whirled, found himself looking 
out into darkness . moonlight 
. their driver a blocky shadow 
against a distant panorama of the 
megalopolis with its shimmering 
networks of light. The moon 
silvered the tops of trees below 
them, and there was a sharp 
smell of forest duff, resinous, 
dank, churned up by the van and 
not yet- settled. The wilderness 
lay silent as though waiting, an- 
olyzing the intrusion. 

“Out,” the driver said. 

T he Cyborg turned. Harvey 
saw the features suddenly 



illuminated by moonlight, said: 
“Glisson!” 

“Greetings, Durant,” Glisson 
said. 

“Why you?” Harvey asked. 

“Why not?” Glisson asked. 
‘Get out of there now.” 

Harvey said: “But my wife 
isn’t . .” 

“I know about your wife,” 
Durant. “She’s had plenty of 
time since the treatment. She 
can walk if she doesn’t exert her- 
self.” 

Igan spoke at Harvey’s ear: 
“She’ll be quite all right. Sit her 
up gently and help her down.” 

“I . feel all right,” Lizbeth 
said. “Here.” She put an arm 
over Harvey’s shoulder. Together 
they slipped down to the ground. 

Igan followed, asked: “Where 
are we?” 

“We are someplace headed for 
someplace else,” Glisson said. 
“What is the condition of our 
prisoner?” 

Boumour spoke from within 
the compartment: “He’s coming 
around. Help me lift him out.” 

“Why’ve we stopped?” Harvey 
asked. 

“There is steep climbing 
ahead,” Glisson said. “We’re 
dropping the load. A van isn’t 
built for this work.” 

Boumour and Igan shouldered 
past them carrying Svengaard 
and propped him against a 
stump beside the track. 



122 



GALAXY 



“Wait here while I disengage 
the trailer,” Glisson said. “You 
might be considering whether we 
should abandon Svengaard.” 

Hearing his name, Svengaard 
opened his eyes, found himself 
staring out and down at the dis- 
tant lights of the megalopolis. 
His jaw ached where Harvey had 
struck him, and there was a 
throbbing in his head. He felt 
hungry, thirsty. His hands were 
numb beyond the bindings. A 
dry smell of evergreen needles 
filled his nostrils. He sneezed. 

“Perhaps we should get rid of 
Svengaard,” Igan said. 

“I think not,” Bouraour said. 
“He’s a trained man, a possible 
ally. We’re going to need trained 
men.” 

Svengaard looked toward the 
voices. They stood beside the 
van which was a long silvery 
shape behind a stubby double 
cab. A wrenching of metal sound- 
ed there. The trailer slid back- 
ward on its skids almost two 
meters before stopping against a 
mound of dirt. 

Glisson returned, squatted be- 
side Svengaard. “What is our de- 
cision?” the Cyborg asked. “Kill 
him or keep him?” 

Harvey gulped, felt Lizbeth 
clutch his arm. 

“Keep him yet awhile,” Bou- 
mour said. 

“If he causes no more trouble,” 
Igan said. 



“We could always use his 
parts,” Glisson said. “Or grow a 
new Svengaard and retrain it.” 
The Cyborg stood. “Not always 
successful, though. An immedi- 
ate decision isn’t necessary. It is 
a thing to consider.” 

Svengaard remained silent, 
frozen by the emotionless clarity 
of the man’s speech. A hard, 
brutal rrtan, he thought. A tough 
man, prepared for any violence. 
A killer. 

“Into the cab with him then,” 
Glisson said. “Everyone into the 
cab. We must get . .” The Cy- 
borg broke off, stared out toward 
the megalopolis. 

C vengaard turned toward the 
^ strings of blue-white light 
glittering far away and cold. A 
winking golden flare had appear- 
ed amidst the lights on his left. 
Another blazed up beyond it — 
a giant’s bonfire set against the 
background of distant, moon- 
frosted mountains. More yellow 
flares appeared to the right. A 
bone-chilling rattle of sonics 
shook him, jarred a sympathetic 
metal dissonance from the van. 

“What’s happening?” Lizbeth 
hissed. 

“Quiet,” Glisson said. “Quiet 
and observe.” 

“Gods of life,” Lizbeth whis- 
pered, “what is it?” 

“It is the death of a megalo- 
polis,” Boumour said. 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



123 



Again sonics rattled the van. 

“That hurts,” Lizbeth whim- 
pered. 

Harvey pulled her close, 
muttered: “Damn them!” 

“Up here it hurts,’ Igan said, 
his voice chillingly formal. 
“Down there it kills.” 

Green fog began emerging 
from the wilderness some ten 
kilometers below them. It rolled 
out and down like a furious 
downy sea beneath the moon, en- 
gulfing everything — hills, the 
gem-like lights, the yellow flares. 

“Did you think they would use 
the death fog?” Boumour asked. 

“We knew they would use it,” 
Glisson said. 

“I suppose so,” Boumour said. 
“Sterilize the area.” 

“What is it?” Harvey demand- 
ed. 

“It comes from the vents where 
they administered the contracep- 
tive gas,” Boumour said. “One 
drop on your skin is the end for 
you.” 

Igan moved around, stared 
down at Svengaard. “They are 
the ones who love us and care 
for us,” he mocked. 

“What’s happening?” Svenga- 
ard asked. 

“Can you not hear?” Igan 
asked. “Can you not see? Your 
friends the Optimen are steriliz- 
ing Seatac. Did you have friends 
there?” 

“Friends?” There was a 



broken quality to Svengaard’s 
voice. He turned back to stare 
at the green fog. The distant 
lights had all been extinguished. 

Again, sonics chattered through 
them, shook the ground, rattled 
the van. 

“What do you think of them 
now?” Igan asked. 

Ovengaard shook his head, un- 
^ able to speak. He wondered 
why he had no sensory fuse sys- 
tem to shut off this scene. He 
felt chained to awareness through 
sense organs gone abnormal be- 
yond any previous experience . 
a permissive aberration. His 
senses were deceiving him, that 
was it. This was a special case 
of self-deception. 

“Why don’t you answer me?” 
Igan asked. 

“Leave him alone,” Harvey 
said. “We’ve griefs of our own. 
Haven’t you any feelings?” 

“He sees it and does not be- 
lieve,” Igan said. 

“How could they?” Lizbeth 
whispered. 

“Self-preservation,” Boumour 
rumbled. “A trait our friend 
Svengaard doesn’t seem to have. 
Perhaps it was cut out of him.” 

Svengaard stared at the rolling 
green cloud. So silent and steal- 
thy it was! The great reach of 
darkness where once there had 
been light and life filled him with 
a raw awareness of his own mor- 



124 



GALAXY 



tality. He thought of friends 
down there — the hospital staff 
. embroyos ... his playmate- 
wife. 

All destroyed. 

Svengaard felt emptied, incap- 
able of any emotion — not even 
grief. He could only question: 
What was their purpose? 

“Into the cab with him,” Glis- 
son said. “On the floor in the 
rear.” 

Ungentle hands lifted Svenga- 
ard — he identified Boumour 
and Glisson. The driver’s unemo- 
tional quality confused Svenga- 
ard. He had never before en- 
countered quite that abstract de- 
tachment in a human being. 

They pushed him onto the 
floor of the van’s cab. The sharp 
edge of a seat brace dug into his 
side. Feet came in around him. 
Someone put a foot on his 
stomach, recoiled. The turbines 
came alive. A door was slammed. 
They glided into motion. 

Svengaard sank into a kind of 
stupor. 

Lizbeth seated above him 
heaved a deep sigh. Hearing it, 
Svengaard was roused to a feel- 
ing of compassion for her, his first 
emotion since the shock of see- 
ing the megalopolis die. 

Why did they do it? he asked 
himself. Why? 

In the darkness, Lizbeth 
gripped Harvey’s hand. She 
could see in an occasional patch 



of moonglow the outline of Glis- 
son directly ahead of her. The 
Cyborg’s minimal movement, the 
sense of power in every action, 
filled her with growing disquiet. 
The scar of her operation itched. 
She wanted to scratch, but fear- 
ed calling attention to herself. 
The Courier Service had been a 
long time building its own or- 
ganization, deceiving both the 
Cyborgs and the Optimen. 
They’d done it partly through 
self-effacement. Now, in her fear, 
she sank back into that treat- 
ment. 

Through their hands, Harvey 
signaled: “Boumour and Igan, I 
read them now. They’re new Cy- 
borgs. Probably just a first link- 
age with implanted computers. 
They’re just learning the price, 
shedding their normal human 
emotional reactions, learning to 
counterfeit emotion.” 

She absorbed this, seeing them 
through Harvey’s deduction. He 
often read people better than she 
did. She reread what she had 
seen of the two surgeons. 

“Do you read it?” he signaled. 

“You’re right. Yes.” 

“It means a total break with 
Central. They can never go 
back.” 

“That explains Seatac,” she 
signaled. She began to tremble. 

“And we can’t trust them,” 
Harvey said. He pressed her 
close, soothing her.

r T"'he van labored up through 
the foothills, skirting open 
meadows, following ancient 
tracks, an occasional streambed. 
Shortly before dawn, it swerved 
left down a firebreak and into a 
stand of pines and cedars, 
squeezed its way through a nar- 
row lane there with its blowers 
kicking up a heavy cloud of for- 
est duff behind. Glisson pulled to 
a stop behind an old building, 
moss on its sides, small curtained 
windows. Pseudo ducks, with a 
weedy patina and grass-grown 
signs that they hadn’t been ani- 
mated in years, made a short 
file near the building — pale 
moonfigures in the light of a 
single bulb high up under the 
building’s eaves. 

Turbines whined to silence. 
They could hear then the hum 
of machinery and looking toward 
the sound saw the dull silver out- 
line of a ventilator tower among 
the trees. 

A door at the corner of the 
building opened. A heavy-headed 
man with a big jaw, stoop- 
shouldered, emerged blowing his 
nose into a red handkerchief. He 
looked old, his face a mask of 
subservience. 

Glisson said: “It’s the sign. All 
is safe here . for the moment.” 
He slipped out, approached the 
old man, coughed. 

126 




GALAXY 



“A lot of sickness around these 
days,” the old man said. His 
voice was as ancient as his 
face, wheezing, slurring the con- 
sonants. 

“You’re not the only one with 
troubles,” Glisson said. 

The old man straightened, 
shed the stooped look and sub- 
servient manner. “S’pose you’re 
wanting a hidey hole,” he said. 
“Don’t know if it’s safe here. 
Don’t even know if I oughta hide 
you.” 

“I will give the orders here,” 
Glisson said. “You will obey.” 

The old man studied Glisson a 
moment, then a look of anger 
washed over his face. “You damn 
Cyborgs!” he said. 

“Hold your tongue,” Glisson 
said, his voice flat. “We need 
food, a safe place to spend the 
day. I shall require your help in 
hiding this van. You must know 
the surrounding terrain. And you 
will arrange other transportation 
for us.” 

“Best cut it up and bury it,” 
the old man said, his voice surly. 
“Been a hornet’s nest stirred up. 
Guess you know that.” 

“We know,” Glisson said. He 
turned, beckoned to the van. 
“Come along. Bring Svengaard.” 

■presently the others joined him. 

Boumour and Igan support- 
ed Svengaard between them. The 
bindings on Svengaard’s feet had 



been released, but he appeared 
barely able to stand. Lizbeth 
walked with the bent-over care 
that said she wasn’t sure her in- 
cision had healed, despite the 
enzymic speed-up medication. 

“We will lodge here during 
daylight,” Glisson said. “This 
man will direct you to quarters.” 
“What word from Seatac?” 
Igan asked. 

Glisson looked at the old man, 
said : “Answer.” 

The oldster shrugged. “Courier 
through here couple of hours 
ago. Said no survivors.” 

“Any report on a Dr. Potter?” 
Svengaard croaked. 

Glisson stared at Svengaard. 
“Dunno,” the old man said. 
“What route he take?” 

Igan cleared his throat, glanced 
at Glisson, then at the old man. 
“Potter? I believe he was in the 
group coming out by the power 
tubes.” 

The old man flicked a glance 
at the ventilator tower growing 
more distinct among the trees 
by the second as daylight crept 
across the mountains. “Nobody 
come through the tubes,” he said. 
“They shut off the ventilators 
and flooded the tubes with that 
gas first thing.” He looked at 
Igan. “Ventilators been going 
again for about three hours.” 
Glisson studied Svengaard, 
asked: “Why are you interested 
in Potter?” 



128 



GALAXY 



Svengaard remained silent. 

“Answer me!” Glisson ordered. 

Svengaard tried to swallow. 
His throat ached. He felt driven 
into a corner. Glisson’s words 
enraged him. Without warning, 
Svengaard lurched forward, drag- 
ging Igan and Boumour, lashed 
out at Glisson with a foot. 

The Cyborg dodged with a 
blurring movement, caught the 
foot, jerked Svengaard from the 
two surgeons, whirled, swung 
Svengaard wide and released 
him. Svengaard landed on his 
back, skidded across the ground, 
stopped. Before he could move, 
Glisson was standing over him. 
Svengaard lay there sobbing. 

“Why are you interested in 
Potter?” Glisson demanded. 

“Go away, go away, go away,” 
Svengaard sobbed. 

Glisson straightened, looked 
around at Igan and Boumour. 
“You understand this?” 

Igan shrugged. “It’s emotion.” 

“Perhaps a shock reaction,” 
Boumour said. 

Through their hands, Harvey 
signaled Lizbeth: “He’s been in 
shock, but this means he’s com- 
ing out of it. These are medical 
people! Can’t they read any- 
thing?” 

“Glisson reads it,” she answer- 
ed. “He was testing them.” 

Glisson turned around, looked 
squarely at Harvey. The bold un- 
derstanding in the Cyborg’s eyes 

HEISENBERG'S EYES 



shot a pang of fear through Har- 
vey. 

“Careful,” Lizbeth signaled. 
“He’s suspicious of us.” 

“Take Svengaard inside,” Glis- 
son said. 

Svengaard looked up at their 
driver. Glisson, the Durants call- 
ed him. But the old man from 
the building had labeled Glisson 
a Cyborg. Was it possible? Were 
the half-men being revived to 
challenge the Optimen once 
more? Was that the reason for 
Seatac’s death? 

Boumour and Igan lifted him, 
checked the fetters on his hands. 
“Let’s have no more foolishness,” 
Boumour said. 

Are they like Glisson? Sven- 
gaard asked himself. Are they, 
too, part man, part machine? 
And what about the Durants? 

Svengaard could feel the tear- 
dampness in his eyes. Hysteria, 
he thought. Coming out of shock. 
He began to wonder at himself 
then with an odd feeling of guilt. 
Why does Potter’s death strike 
me more deeply than the death 
of an entire megalopolis, the ex- 
tinction of my wife and friends? 
What did Potter symbolize to 
me? 

T> oumour and Igan half carried, 
half walked him into the 
building, down a narrow hall and 
into a poorly lighted, gloomy big 
room with a ceiling that went 



129 



up to bare beams two stories 
above. They dropped him onto 
a dusty couch — bare plastic 
and hydraulic contour shapers 
that adjusted reluctantly. The 
light came from two glowglobes 
high up under the beams. It ex- 
posed oddments of furniture 
scattered around the room and 
mounds of strange shape covered 
by slick, glistening fabric. A table 
to his left, he realized, was 
planks. Wood! A contour cot lay 
beyond it, and an ancient roll- 
top desk with a missing drawer, 
mismatched chairs. A stained, 
soot-blackened fireplace with an 
iron crane reaching across its 
mouth like a gibbet occupied half 
the wall across from him. The 
entire room smelled of damp- 
ness and rot. The floor creaked 
as people moved. Wood flooring! 

Svengaard looked up at tiny 
windows admitting a sparse gray 
daylight that grew brighter by 
the second. Even at its brightest 
he knew it wouldn’t dispel the 
gloom of this place. Here was 
sadness that made him think of 
people without number — dead, 
forgotten. Tears rolled down his 
cheeks. 

What’s wrong with me? he 
wondered. 

There came a sound from the 
yard of the van’s turbines being 
ignited. He heard it lift, leave 
. fade away. Harvey and 
Lizbeth entered the room. 



Lizbeth looked at Svengaard, 
then at Boumour and Igan who 
had taken up vigil on the cot. 
With her crouched, protective 
walk, she crossed to Svengaard, 
touched his shoulder. She saw 
his tears, evidence of humanity, 
and she wished then that he were 
her doctor. Perhaps there was a 
way. She decided to ask Harvey. 

“Please trust us,” she said. 
“We won’t harm you. They are 
the ones who killed your wife 
and friends, not us.” 

Svengaard pulled away. 

How dare she have pity on 
me? he thought. But she had 
reached some chord in him. He 
could feel himself shattering. 

Oppressive silence settled over 
the room. 

Harvey came up, guided his 
wife to a chair at the table. 

“It’s wood,” she said, touching 
the surface, wonder in her voice. 
Then: “Harvey, I’m very hun- 
gry.” 

“They’ll bring food as soon as 
they’ve disposed of the van,” he 
said. 

She clutched his hand, and 
Svengaard watched, fascinated by 
the nervous movement of her 
fingers. 

Glisson and the old man re- 
turned presently, slamming the 
door behind them. The building 
creaked with their movement. 

“We’ll have a forest patrol ve- 
hicle for the next stage,” Glisson 



130 



GALAXY 



said. “Much safer. There’s a 
thing you all should know now.” 
The Cyborg moved a cold, 
weighted stare from face to face. 
“There was a marker on top of 
the van’s load section which we 
abandoned last night.” 
“Marker?” Lizbeth said. 

“A device for tracing us, fol- 
lowing us,” Glisson said. 

“Ohhh!” Lizbeth put a hand 
over her mouth. 

“I do not know how closely 
they were following,” Glisson 
said. “I was altered for this task, 
and certain of my devices were 
left behind. They may know 
where we are right now.” 

Harvey shook his head. “But 
why . .” 

“Why haven’t they moved 
against us?” Glisson asked. “It’s 
obvious. They hope we’ll lead 
them to the vitals of our organi- 
zation.” Something like rage 
came into the Cyborg’s features. 
“It may be we can surprise 
them.” 

XXII 

I n the Survey Room, the great 
globe’s instrumented inner 
walls lay relatively quiescent. 
Calapine and Schruille of the 
Tuyere occupied the triple 
thrones. The dais turned slowly, 
allowing them to scan the en- 
tire surface. Kaleidoscopic colors 
from the instruments played a 



somnolent visible melody across 
Calapine’s features — a wash of 
greens, reds, purples. 

She felt tired, with a definite 
emotion of self pity. There was 
something wrong with the en- 
zymic analyzers. She felt sure 
of it, wondering if the Under- 
ground had somehow com- 
promised the function of the 
pharmacy computers. 

Schruille was no help. He’d 
laughed at the suggestion. 

Allgood’s features appeared on 
a call screen before Calapine. She 
stopped the turning dais as he 
bowed, said: “I call to report, 
Calapine.” She noted the dark 
circles under his eyes, the 
drugged awareness in the way he 
held his head stiffly erect. 

“You have found them?” Cala- 
pine asked. 

“They’re somewhere in the 
wilderness area, Calapine,” All- 
good said. “They have to be in 
there.” 

“Have to be!” she sneered. 
“You’re a foolish optimist, Max.” 

“We know some of the hiding 
places they could’ve chosen, 
Calapine.” 

“For every one you know, 
they’ve nine you don’t know,” 
she said. 

“I have the entire area ringed, 
Calapine. We’re moving in slow- 
ly, checking everywhere as we 
go. They’re there, and we’ll find 
them.”

“He babbles,” she said, glanc- 
ing at Schruille. 

Schruille returned a mirthless 
smile, looked at Allgood through 
the prismatic reflector. “Max, 
have you found the source of 
the substitute embryo?” 

“Not yet, Schruille.” 

He stared up at them, his face 
betraying his obvious confusion 
at the militancy and violence of 
his Optimen. 

“Do you seek in Seatac?” 
Calapine demanded. 

Allgood wet his lips. 

“Out with it!” she snapped. 
Ahhh the fear in his eyes. 

“We’re searching there, Cala- 
pine, but the . .” 

“You think we were too pre- 
cipitate?” she asked. 

He shook his head. 

“You’re acting strangely,” 
Schruille said. “Are you afraid 
of us?” 

He hesitated, then: “Yes, 

Schruille.” 

“Yes, Schruille!” Calapine mi- 
micked. 

Allgood looked at her, the fear 
in his eyes tempered by anger. 
“I’m taking every action I know, 
Calapine.” 

S he marked a sudden precision 
in his manner behind the 
anger. Her eyes went wide with 
wonder. Was it possible? She 
looked at Schruille, wondering if 
he had seen it. 



“Max, why did you call us?” 
Schruille asked. 

“I . to report, Schruille.” 
“You’ve reported nothing.” 
Hesitantly, Calapine brought 
up her instruments for a special 
probe of Allgood, stared at the 
result. Horror mingled with rage 
in her. Cyborg! They had defiled 
Max! Her Max! 

“There’s only need for you to 
obey us,” Schruille said. 

Allgood nodded silently. 
“You!” Calapine hissed. She 
leaned toward the screen. “You 
dared! Why? Why, Max?” 
Schruille said: “What . .” 
But in the shocked instant of 
her questions, Allgood had seen 
that he was discovered. He knew 
it was his end, could see it in 
her eyes. “I saw ... I found the 
doppelgangers,” he stammered. 

An angry twist of her hand 
rolled one of the rings on her 
thome arm. Sonics sent a shock 
wave chattering across Allgood, 
blurred his image. His lips moved 
soundlessly, eyes staring. He col- 
lapsed. 

“Why did you do that?” 
Schruille asked. 

“He was Cyborg!” she grated 
and pointed to the evidence of 
the instruments. 

“Max? Our Max?” He looked 
at the instruments, nodded. 

“My Max,” she said. 

“But he worshipped you, loved 
you.” 



132 



GALAXY 



“He does nothing now,” she 
whispered. She blanked the 
screen, continued to stare at it. 
Already the incident was reced- 
ing from her mind. 

“Do you enjoy direct action?” 
Schruille asked. 

She met his gaze in the reflec- 
tor. Enjoy direct action? There 
was indeed a kind of elation in 
. violence. 

“We have no Max now,” 
Schruille said. 

“We’ll waken another dopple- 
ganger,” she said. “Security can 
function without him for now.” 

“Who’ll waken the doppel- 
ganger?” he asked. “Igan and 
Boumour are no longer with us. 
The Pharmacist, Hand, is gone.” 

“What’s keeping Nourse?” she 
asked. 

“Enzymic trouble,” Schruille 
said, a note of glee in his voice. 
“He said something about a 
necessary realignment of his 
prescription. Bonellia hormone 
derivatives, I believe.” 

“Nourse can awaken the dop- 
pelganger,” she said. She won- 
dered momentarily then why 
they needed the doppelganger. 
Oh, yes. Max was gone. 

C C nphere’s more to it than 
merely awakening Max’s 
duplicate,” Schruille said. 
“They’re not as good as they 
once were, you know. The new 
Max must be educated for his 



role, fitted into it gently. It could 
be weeks . months.” 

“Then one of us can run Se- 
curity,” she said. 

“You think we’re ready for it?” 
Schruille asked. 

“There’s a thrill in this sort of 
decision making,” she said. “I 
don’t mind saying I’ve been 
deeply bored during the past 
several hundred years. But now 
. now I feel alive, vital, alert, 
fascinated.” She looked up at 
the glowing banks of scanner 
eyes, a full band of them, show- 
ing their fellow Optimen watch- 
ing activities in the Survey 
Room. “And I’m not alone in 
this.” 

Schruille glanced up at the 
glittering arctic circle of the 
globe’s inner wall. “Aliveness,” 
he murmured. “But Max ... he 
is dead-” 

“Any Max can be replaced,” 
she said. She looked at Schruille, 
turning her head to stare past 
the prism. “You’re very blunt 
today, Schruille. You’ve spoken 
of death twice that I recall.” 
“Blunt? I?” He shook his 
head. “But I didn’t erase Max.” 
She laughed aloud. “My own 
reactions thrill me, Schruille!” 
“And do you find changes in 
your enzymic demands?” 

“A few. What is that? Times 
change. It’s part of being. Ad- 
justments must be made.” 
“Indeed,” he said. 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



133 



“Where’d they find a substi- 
tute for the Durant embryo?” she 
asked, her mind shooting off at a 
tangent. 

“Perhaps the new Max can 
discover,” Schruille said. 

“He must.” 

“Or you will grow another 
Max,” Schruille said. 

“Don’t mock me, Schruille.” 
“I wouldn’t dare.’ 

Again she looked directly at 
him. 

“What if they produced their 
own embryo for the substitu- 
tion?” Schruille asked. 

She turned away. “In the name 
of all that’s proper, how?” 

“Air can be filtered clean of 
contraceptive gas,” Schruille 
said. 

“You’re disgusting!” 

“Am I? But haven’t you won- 
dered what Potter concealed?” 
“Potter? We know what he 
concealed.” 

“A person devoted to the pre- 
vention of life . such as that 
is,” Schruille said. “What did he 
hide in his mind?” 

“Potter is no more.” 

“But what did he conceal?” 
“You think he knew the source 
of the . outside interference?” 
“Perhaps. And he would know 
where to find an embryo.” 

“Then the record will show 
the source as you have already 
said yourself.” 

“I’ve been reconsidering.” 



S he stared at him in the prism. 
“It’s not possible.” 

“That I could reconsider?” 
“You know what I mean — 
what you’re thinking.” 

“But it is possible.” 

“It isn’t!” 

“You’re being stubborn, Cal. 
A female should be the last per- 
son to deny such a possibility.” 
“Now, you’re being truly dis- 
gusting!” 

“We know Potter found a self- 
viable,” Schruille pressed. “They 
could have many self-viables — 
male and female. We know his- 
torically the capabilities of such 
raw union. It’s part of our nat- 
ural ancestry.” 

“You’re unspeakable,” she 
breathed. 

“You can face the concept of 
death, but not this,” Schruille 
said. “Most interesting.” 
“Disgusting!” she barked. 

“But possible,” Schruille said. 
“The substitute embryo wasn’t 
self-viable!” she pounced. 

“All the more reason they 
might’ve been willing to sacrifice 
it for one that was, eh?” 

“Where would they find the 
vat facilities, the chemicals, the 
enzymes, the . 

“Where they’ve always been.” 
“What?” 

“They’ve put the Durant em- 
bryo back into its mother,” 
Schruille said. “We can be cer- 
tain of this. Would it not be 



134 



GALAXY 



equally logical to leave the em- 
bryo there to begin with — never 
remove it never isolate the 
gametes in a vat at all?” 

Calapine found herself speech- 
less. She sensed a sour taste in 
her mouth, realized with a feel- 
ing of shock that she wanted to 
vomit. Something’s wrong with 
my enzyme balance, she thought. 

She spoke slowly, precisely: “I 
am reporting to pharmacy at 
once, Schruille. I do not feel 
well.” 

‘‘By all means,” Schruille 
said. He glanced up and around 
at the watching scanners: a full 
circle of them. 

Delicately, Calapine eased her- 
self out of her throne, slid down 
the beam to the lock segment. 
Before letting herself out, she 
cast a look up at the dais, faintly 
remembering. Which Max was 
erased? she asked herself. We’ve 
had many of him ... a success- 
ful model for our Security. She 
thought of the others, Max after 
Max after Max, each shunted 
aside when his appearance began 
to annoy his masters. They 
stretched into infinity, images in 
an endless system of mirrors. 

What is erasure to such as 
Max? she wondered. I am an un- 
broken continuity of existence. 
But 'a doppelganger doesn’t re- 
member. A doppelganger breaks 
the continuity. 

Unless the cells remember. 



Memory . cells . embryos. 

She thought of the embryo 
within Lizbeth Durant. Disgust- 
ing, but simple. So beautifully 
simple. Her gorge began to rise. 
Whirling, Calapine dropped 
down to the Hall of Counsel, ran 
for the nearest pharmacy outlet. 
As she ran, she clenched the 
hand that had slain Max and 
helped destroy a magalopolis. 

XXIII 

ttOhe’s sick, I tell you!” 

^Harvey bent over Igan, 
shaking him out of sleep. They 
were in a narrow earth-walled 
room, ceiling of plasmeld beams, 
a dim yellow glowglobe in one 
corner. Sleeping pads were 
spread against the walls, Boum- 
our and Igan on two of them 
foot to foot, the bound form of 
Svengaard on another, two of the 
pads empty. 

“Come quickly!” Harvey 
pleaded. “She’s sick.” 

Igan groaned, sat up. He 
glanced at his watch — almost 
sunset on the surface. They’d 
crawled in here just before day- 
light and after a night of laboring 
on foot up seemingly endless 
woods trails behind a Forest Pa- 
trol guide. Igan still ached from 
the unaccustomed exercise. 

Lizbeth sick? 

She’d had three days since the 
embryo had been placed within 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



135 



her. The others had healed this 
rapidly, but they hadn’t been 
subjected to a night of stumbling 
along the rough forest trails. 

“Please hurry,” Harvey plead- 
ed. 

“I’m coming,” Igan said. And 
he thought: Listen to his tone 
change now that he needs me. 

Boumour sat up opposite him, 
asked: “Shall I join you?” 

“Wait here for Glisson,” Igan 
said. 

“Did Glisson say where he was 
going?” 

“To arrange for another guide. 
It’ll be dark soon.” 

“Doesn’t he ever sleep?” Bou- 
mour asked. 

“Please!” Harvey begged. 

“Yes!” Igan snapped. “What’re 
her symptoms?” 

“Vomiting . incoherent.” 

“Let me get my bag.” Igan re- 
trieved a thick black case from 
the floor near his head, glanced 
across at Svengaard. The man’s 
breathing still showed the even 
rhythm of the narcotic they’d 
administered before collapsing 
into sleep themselves. Something 
had to be done about Svengaard. 
He slowed them down. 

Harvey pulled at Igan’s sleeve. 

“I’m coming! I’m coming!” 
Igan said. He freed his arm, fol- 
lowed Harvey through a low hole 
at the end of the room and into 
a room similar to the one they’d 
just vacated. Lizbeth lay on a 



pad beneath a single glowglobe 
across from them. She groaned. 

Harvey knelt beside her. “I’m 
right here.” 

“Harvey,” she whispered. “Oh, 
Harvey.” 

Igan joined them, lifted a pul- 
monometer - sphagnomometer 
from his bag. He pressed it 
against her neck, read the dial. 
“Where do you hurt?” he asked. 

“Ohhhh,” she moaned. 

“Please,” Harvey said, looking 
at Igan. “Please do something.” 

“Stand out of the way,” Igan 
said. 

Harvey stood up, backed off 
two steps. “What is it?” he whis- 
pered. 

Igan ignored him, taped an en- 
zymic vampire gauge to Liz- 
beth’s left wrist, read the dials. 

“What’s wrong with her?” Har- 
vey demanded. 

I gan unclipped his instruments, 
restored them to his bag. 
“Nothing’s wrong with her.” 
“But she’s . .” 

“She’s perfectly normal. Most 
of the others reacted the same 
way. It’s realignment of her en- 
zymic demand system.” 

“Isn’t there some . .” 

“Calm down!” Igan stood up, 
faced Harvey. “She barely needs 
any prescription material. Pretty 
soon, she can do without alto- 
gether. She’s in better health 
than you are. And she could walk 



136 



GALAXY 



into a pharmacy right now. The 
prescription flag wouldn’t even 
identify her.” 

“Then why’s she . .” 

“It’s the embryo. It compen- 
sates for her needs and protects 
itself. Does it automatically.” 
“But she’s sick!” 

“A bit of glandular maladjust- 
ment, nothing else.” Igan picked 
up his bag. “It’s all part of the 
ancient process. The embryo says 
produce this, produce that. She 
produces. Puts a certain strain on 
her system.” 

“Can’t you do anything for 
her?” 

“Of course I can. She’ll be ex- 
tremely hungry in a little while. 
We’ll give her something to settle 
her stomach and then feed her. 
Provided they can produce some 
food in this hole.” 

Lizbeth groaned : “Harvey?” 
He knelt beside her, clasped 
her hands. “Yes, dear?” 

“I feel terrible.” 

“They’ll give you something 
in a few minutes.” 

“Ohhhh.” 

Harvey turned a fierce scowl 
up at Igan. 

“As soon as we can,” Igan 
said. “Don’t worry. This is nor- 
mal.” He turned, ducked out into 
the other room. 

“What’s wrong?” Lizbeth whis- 
pered. 

“It’s the embryo,” Harvey 
said. “Didn’t you hear?” 

HEISENBERG'S EYES 



“Yes. My head aches.” 

Igan returned with a capsule 
and a cup of water, bent over 
Lizbeth. “Take this. It’ll settle 
your stomach.” 

Harvey helped her sit up, held 
her while she swallowed the cap- 
sule. 

She took a quavering breath, 
returned the cup. “I’m sorry to 
be such a . .” 

“Quite all right,” Igan said. 
He looked at Harvey. “Best 
bring her in the other room. Glis- 
son will return in a few minutes. 
He should have food and a 
guide.” 

Y_ Tarvey helped his wife to her 
feet, supported her as they 
followed Igan into the other 
room. They found Svengaard sit- 
ting up staring at his bound 
hands. 

“Have you been listening?” 
Igan asked. 

Svengaard looked at Lizbeth. 
“Yes.” 

“Have you thought about Sea- 
tac?” 

“I’ve thought.” 

“You’re thinking of releasing 
him?” Harvey asked. 

“He slows us too much,” Igan 
said. “And we cannot release 
him.” 

“Perhaps I should do some- 
thing about him,” Harvey said. 

“What do you suggest, Dur- 
ant?” Boumour asked. 



137 



“He’s a danger to us,” Harvey 

said. 

“Ahh,” Boumour said. “Then 
we leave him to you.” 

“Harvey!” Lizbeth said. She 
wondered if he’d suddenly gone 
mad. Was this his reaction to her 
request that they seek Svengaard 
as her doctor? 

But Harvey was remembering 
Lizbeth’s moans. “If it’s him or 
my son,” he said, “the choice is 
easy.” 

Lizbeth took his hand, sig- 
naled: “What’re you doing? You 
can’t mean this!” 

“What is he, anyway?” Har- 
vey asked, staring at Igan. And 
he signaled Lizbeth: “Wait. 

Watch.” 

She read her husband then, 
pulled away. 

“He’s a gene surgeon,” Harvey 
said. His voice dripped scorn. 
“He’s existed for them. Can he 
justify his existence? He’s a non- 
viable, non-living non-entity. He 
has no future.” 

“Is that your choice?” Bou- 
mour asked. 

Svengaard looked up at Har- 
vey. “Do you talk of murdering 
me?” he asked. The lack of emo- 
tion in his voice surprised Har- 
vey. 

“You don’t protest?” he asked. 

Svengaard tried to swallow. 
His throat felt full of dry cotton. 
He looked at Harvey, measuring 
the bulk of the man, the corded 



muscles. He remembered the ex- 
cessive male protectiveness in 
Harvey’s nature, the gene-error 
that made him a slave to Liz- 
beth’s slightest need. 

“Why should I argue,” Sven- 
gaard asked, “when much of 
what he says is true and when 
he’s already made up his mind?” 

“How will you do it, Durant?” 
Boumour asked. 

“How would you like me to do 
it?” Harvey asked. 

“Strangulation might be inter- 
esting,” Boumour said, and Har- 
vey wondered if Svengaard, too, 
could hear the Cyborg clinical 
detachment in the man’s voice. 

“A simple snap of the neck is 
quicker,” Igan said. “Or an in- 
jection. I could supply several 
from my kit.” 

TT arvey felt Lizbeth trembling 

-*■ against him. He patted her 
arm, disengaged himself. 

“Harvey!” she said. 

He shook his head, advanced 
on Svengaard. 

Igan retreated to Boumour’s 
side, stood watching. 

Harvey knelt behind Sven- 
gaard, placed his fingers around 
the surgeon’s throat, bent close to 
the ear opposite his audience. In 
a whisper audible only to Sven- 
gaard, Harvey said: “They would 
as soon see you dead. They don’t 
care one way or another. How do 
you feel about it?” 



138 



GALAXY 



Svengaard felt the hands on his 
throat. He knew he could reach 
up with his bound hands and try 
to remove those clutching fingers, 
but he knew he’d fail. There was 
no doubting Harvey’s strength. 

“Your own choice?” Harvey 
whispered. 

“Do it, man!” Boumour called. 

Only seconds ago, Svengaard 
realized, he’d been resigned to 
death, wanted death. Suddenly, 
that wish was the farthest thing 
from his desires. 

“I want to live,” he husked. 

“Is that your choice?” Harvey 
whispered. 

“Yes!” 

“Are you talking to him?” 
Boumour asked. 

“Why do you want to live?” 
Harvey asked in a normal voice. 
He relaxed his fingers slightly, a 
subtle communication to Sven- 
gaard. Even an untrained person 
could read this. 

“Because I’ve never been 
alive,” Svengaard said. “I want 
to try it.” 

“But how can you justify your 
existence?” Harvey asked, allow- 
ing his fingers to tighten. 

Svengaard looked at Lizbeth, 
sensing at last the direction of 
Harvey’s thoughts. He glanced at 
Boumour and Igan. 

“You haven’t answered my 
question,” Boumour said. “What 
are you discussing with our pris- 
oner?” 



“Are they both Cyborgs?” 
Svengaard asked. 

“Irretrievably,” Harvey said. 
“Without human feelings — or 
near enough to it that it makes 
no difference.” 

“Then how can you trust them 
with your wife’s care?” 

Harvey’s fingers relaxed. 

“That is a way I could justify 
my existence,” Svengaard said. 

Harvey removed his hands 
from Svengaard’s throat, squeez- 
ed the man’s shoulders. It was 
instant communication, more 
than words, something that went 
from flesh to flesh. Svengaard 
knew he had an ally.

Tjoumour crossed to stand over 
•*- ' them, demanded: “Are you 
going to kill him or aren’t you?” 

“No one here’s going to kill 
him,” Harvey said. 

“What’ve you been doing?” 

“Solving a problem,” Harvey 
said. He kept a hand on Sven- 
gaard’s arm. Svengaard found he 
could understand Harvey’s intent 
just by the pressure of that hand. 
It said: “Wait. Be still. Let me 
handle this.” 

“And what do you intend for 
our prisoner?” Boumour de- 
manded. 

“I intend to free him and put 
my wife in his care,” Harvey 
said.

Boumour glared at him. “And 
if that incurs our displeasure?” 

“What idiocy!” Igan blared. 
“How can you trust him when 
we’re available?” 

“This is a fellow human,” Har- 
vey said. “What he does for my 
wife will be out of humanity and 
not like a mechanic treating her 
as a machine for transporting an 
embryo.” 

“This is nonsense!” Igan snap- 
ped. But he realized then that 
Harvey had recognized their Cy- 
borg nature. 

Boumour raised a hand to 
silence him as Igan made to go 
on. “You have not indicated how 
you will do this if we oppose it,” 
he said. 

“You’re not full Cyborgs,” 
Harvey said. “I see fears in you 
yet and uncertainties. It’s new to 
you, and you’re changing. I sus- 
pect you’re very vulnerable yet.” 

Boumour backed off three 
steps, his eyes measuring Harvey. 
“And Glisson?” Boumour asked. 

“Glisson wants only trust- 
worthy allies,” Harvey said. “I’m 
giving him a trustworthy ally.” 

“How do you know you cah 
trust Svengaard?” Igan demand- 
ed. 

“Because you have to ask, you 
betray your ineffectiveness,” 
Harvey said. He turned, began 
unfastening Svengaard’s fetters. 

“It’s on your head,” Boumour 
said. 

140 



Harvey freed Svengaard’s 
hands, knelt and removed the 
bindings from his feet. 

“I’m going for Glisson,” Igan 
said. He left the room. 

T ¥ arvev stood up, faced Sven- 
gaard. “Do you know about 
my wife’s condition?” he asked. 

“I heard Igan,” Svengaard 
said. “Every surgeon studies his- 
tory and genetic origins. I have 
an academic knowledge of her 
condition.” 

Boumour sniffed. 

“There’s Igan’s medical kit,” 
Harvey said, pointing to the 
black case on the floor. “Tell me 
why my wife was sick.” 

“You’re not satisfied with 
Igan’s explanation?” Boumour 
asked. He appeared outraged by 
the thought. 

“He said it was natural,” Har- 
vey said. “How can sickness be 
natural?” 

“She has received medication,” 
Svengaard said. “Do you know 
what it was?” 

“It had the same markings as 
the pill he gave her in the van,” 
Harvey said. “A tranquilizer he 
called it then.” 

Svengaard approached Lizbeth, 
looked at her eyes, her skin. 
“Bring the kit,” he said, nodding 
to Harvey. He guided Lizbeth to 
an empty pad, finding himself 
fascinated by the idea of this 
examination. Once he had 



GALAXY 



thought of this as disgusting; 
now the idea that Lizbeth car- 
ried an embryo in her in the an- 
cient way held only mystery for 
him, a profound curiosity. 

Lizbeth sent a questioning look 
at Harvey as Svengaard eased 
her back onto the pad. Harvey 
nodded reassuringly. She tried to 
smile, but a strange fear had 
come over her. The fear didn’t 
originate with Svengaard. His 
hands were full of gentle assur- 
ance. But the prospect of being 
examined frightened her. She 
could feel terror warring with the 
drug Igan had given her. 

Svengaard opened the kit, re- 
membering the diagrams and ex- 
planations from the study tapes 
of his school years. They had 
been tire subject of ribald jokes 
then, but even the jokes helped 
him now because they tended to 
fix vital facts in his mind. 

“Cling to the wall, for if you 
fall 

“ You then must learn to do the 
crawl!” 

In his memory, he could hear 
the chant and the uproarious 
burst of laughter. 

Svengaard bent to his examin- 
ation, excluding all else but the 
patient and himself. Blood pres- 
sure . enzymes . hormone 
production . bodily secretions. 

Presently, he frowned. 

“Is something wrong?” Harvey 
asked. 




HEISENBERG'S EYES 



141 





Boumour stood, arms folded, 
behind Harvey. “Yes, do tell us,” 
he said. 

“Menstrual hormone complex 
is much too high,” Svengaard 
said. And he thought: “Cling to 
the wall . 

“The embryo controls these 
changes,” Boumour sneered. 

“Yes,” Svengaard said. “But 
why this shift in hormone pro- 
duction?” 

“From your superior knowl- 
edge, you’ll now tell us,” Bou- 
mour said. 

Ovengaard ignored the mocking 
k -' tone, looked up at Boumour. 
“You’ve done this before. Have 
you had any spontaneous abor- 
tions in your patients?” 

Boumour frowned. 

“Well?” Svengaard said. 

“A few.” He supplied the infor- 
mation grudgingly. 

“I suspect the embryo isn’t 
firmly attached to the endome- 
trium,” Svengaard said. “To the 
wall of the uterus,” he said, rec- 
ognizing Harvey’s need for ex- 
planation. “The embryo must 
cling to the uterus wall, and this 
is prepared for by hormones that 
are present during the menstrual 
cycle.” 

Boumour shrugged. “Well, we 
expect to lose a certain percen- 
tage.” 

“My wife is not a certain per- 
centage,” Harvey growled. He 

142 



turned, focused a glare on Bou- 
mour that sent the man retreat- 
ing three steps. 

“But these things happen,” 
Boumour said. He looked at 
Svengaard, who was preparing a 
slapshot ampule from Igan’s kit. 
“What’re you doing?” 

“Giving her a little enzymic 
stimulation to produce the hor- 
mones she needs,” Svengaard 
said. He glanced at Harvey, see- 
ing the man’s fears and need for 
reassurance. “It’s the best thing 
we can do now, Durant. It should 
work if her system hasn’t been 
too upset by all this.” He waved 
a hand indicating their fright, 
the emotional stress, the exer- 
tion. 

“Do whatever you think you 
should,” Harvey said. 

Svengaard administered the 
shot, patted Lizbeths arm. “Try 
to rest. Relax. Don’t move 
around unless it’s necessary.” 
Lizbeth nodded. She had been 
reading Svengaard, seeing his 
genuine concern for her. His at- 
tempt to reassure Harvey had 
touched her, but there were 
fears she couldn’t suppress. 
“Glisson,” she whispered. 
Svengaard saw the direction of 
her thoughts, said: “I won’t per- 
mit him to move you until I’m 
sure you’re all right He and his 
guide will just have to wait.” 
“You won’t permit!” Boumour 
sneered. 



GALAXY 



As though to punctuate his 
words, the ground around them 
rumbled and shook. Dust puffed 
through the low entrance, and, 
like a magicians trick, Glisson 
materialized there as the con- 
cealing dust settled. 

A t the first sign of disturbance, 
Harvey had dropped to the 
floor beside Lizbeth. He held her 
shoulders, shielded her with his 
body. 

Svengaard still knelt beside the 
medical kit. 

Boumour had whirled to stare 
at Glisson. “Sonics?” Boumour 
hissed. 

“Not sonics,” Glisson said. The 
Cyborg’s usually flat voice car- 
ried a singsong twang. 

“He has no arms,” Harvey 

said. 

They all noticed it then. From 
the shoulders down, where Glis- 
son’s arms had been, now dan- 
gled only the empty linkages for 
Cyborg prosthetic attachments. 

“ They have sealed us in here,” 
Glisson said. Again that singsong 
twang, as though something 
about him had been broken. “As 
you can see, I am disarmed. Do 
you not think that amusing? Do 
you see now why we could never 
fight them openly? When they 
wish it, they can destroy any- 
thing . anyone.” 

“Igan?” Boumour whispered. 

“Igans are easy to destroy,” 



Glisson said. “I have seen it. Ac- 
cept the fact.” 

“But what’ll we do?” Harvey 
demanded. 

“Do?” Glisson looked down at 
him. “We will wait.” 

“One of you could stand off 
an entire Security force to get 
Potter away,” Boumour said. 
“But all you can do now is wait?” 

“Violence is not my function,” 
Glisson said. “You will see.” 

“What’ll they do?” Lizbeth 
hissed. 

“Whatever they wish to do,” 
Glisson said. 

XXV 

tt r T''here, it is done,” Calapine 
said. 

She looked at Schruille and 
Nourse in the reflectors. 

Schruille indicated the kines- 
thetic analogue relays of the Sur- 
vey Globe’s inner wall. “Did you 
obsei've Svengaard’s emotion?” 

“He was properly horrified,” 
Calapine said. 

Schruille pursed his lips, stud- 
ied her reflection. A session with 
the pharmacy had restored her 
composure, but she occupied her 
throne in a subdued mood. The 
kaleidoscopic play of lights from 
the wall gave an unhealthy cast 
to her skin. There was a definite 
flush to her features. 

Nourse glanced up at the ob- 
server lights. The span of arctic 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



143 



wall glowed with a dull red in- 
tensity, every position occupied. 
With hardly an exception, the 
Optiman community watched 
developments. 

“We have a decision to make,” 
Nourse said. 

“You look pale, Nourse,” Cal- 
apine said. “Did you have phar- 
macy trouble?” 

“No more than you.” He spoke 
defensively. “A simple enzymic 
heterodyning. It’s pretty well 
damped out.” 

“I say bring them here now,” 
Schruille said. 

“To what purpose?” Nourse 
asked. “We have the pattern of 
their flight very well fixed. Why 
let them escape again?” 

“I don’t like the thought of un- 
registered self-viables — who 
knows how many? — running 
loose out there,” Schruille said. 

“Are you sure we could take 
them alive?” Calapine asked. 

“The Cyborg admits ineffec- 
tiveness against us,” Schruille 
said. 

“Unless that’s a trick,” Nourse 
said. 

“I don’t think so,” Calapine 
said. “And once we have them 
here we can extract the informa- 
tion we need from their raw 
brains with the utmost pre- 
cision.” 

Nourse turned, stared at her. 
He couldn’t understand what had 
happened to Calapine. She spoke 



with the callous brutality of a 
Folk woman. She was like an 
awakened ghoul, as though vio- 
lence were her rising bell. 

What is her setting bell? he 
wondered. And he was shocked 
at his own thought. 

“If they have means of de- 
stroying themselves?” Nourse 
asked. “I remind you of the com- 
puter nurse and a sad number of 
our own surgeons who appeared 
to be in league with these crim- 
inals. We were powerless to pre- 
vent their self-destruction.” 

(, i T T ow callous you are, 

-*■ Nourse,” Calapine said. 
“Callous? I?” He shook his 
head. “I merely wish to prevent 
further pain. Let us destroy them 
ourselves and go on from here.” 
“Glisson’s a full Cyborg,” 
Schruille said. “Can you imagine 
what his memory banks would 
reveal?” 

“I remember the one who es- 
corted Potter,” Nourse said. “Let 
us take no risk. His quietude 
could be a trick.” 

“A contact narcotic in their 
present cell,” Schruille said. 
“That’s my suggestion.” 

“How do you know it’ll work 
on the Cyborgs?” Nourse asked. 

“Then they could escape once 
more,” Schruille said. He shrug- 
ged. “What matters it?” 

“Into another megalopolis,” 
Nourse said. “Is that it?” 



144 



GALAXY 



“We know the infection’s wide- 
spread,” Schruille said. “Cer- 
tainly, there were cells right here 
in Central. We’ve cleaned out 
those, but the . .” 

“I say stop them now!” Nourse 
snapped. 

“I agree with Schruille,” Cal- 
apine said. “What’s the risk?” 
“The sooner we stop them the 
sooner we can return to our own 
pursuits,” Nourse said. 

“This is our pursuit,” Schruille 
said. 

“You like the idea of steriliz- 
ing another megalopolis, don’t 
you, Schruille?” Nourse sneered. 
“Which one this time? How 
about Loovil?” 

“Once was enough,” Schruille 
said. “But likes and dislikes real- 
ly have nothing to do with it.” 
“Let us put it to a vote then,” 
Calapine said. 

“Because you’re two to one 
against me, eh?” Nourse said. 

“She means a full vote,” 
Schruille said. He looked up at 
the observation lights. “We’ve 
obviously a quorum.” 

Nourse stared at the indicat- 
ors knowing he’d been neatly 
trapped. He dared not protest a 
full vote — any vote. And his two 
companions appeared so sure of 
themselves. “This is our pursuit.” 
“We’ve allowed the Cyborgs to 
interfere,” Nourse said, “because 
they increased the proportion of 
viables in the genetic reserve. 



Did we do this merely to destroy 
the genetic reserve?” 

Schruille indicated a bank of 
binary pyramids on the globe’s 
wall. “If they endanger us, cer- 
tainly. But the issue is unregis- 
tered se/f-viables, their possible 
immunity to the contraceptive 
gas. Where else could they have 
produced the substitute em- 
bryo?” 

“If it comes down to it, we 
don’t need any of them,” Cal- 
apine said. 

“Destroy them all?” Nourse 
asked. “All the Folk?” 

“And raise a new crop of dop- 
pelgangers,” she said. 

“Duplicates don’t always come 
true,” Nourse said. 

“Nothing limits us,” Schruille 
said. 

“Our sun isn’t infinite,” Nourse 
said. 

i C'VT/'e’ll solve that when the 
’ ’ need arises,” Calapine 
said. “What problem can defy 
us? We’re not limited by Time.” 

“Yet we’re sterile,” Nourse 
said. “Our gametes refuse to 
unite.” 

“And well they do,” Schruille 
said. “I’d not have it otherwise.” 

“All we wish now is a simple 
vote,” Calapine said. “A simple 
vote on whether to capture and 
bring in one tiny band of crim- 
inals. Why should that arouse 
major debate?’ 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



145 



Nourse started to speak, 
thought better of it. He shook his 
head, looked from Calapine to 
Schruille. 

“Well?” Schruille asked. 

“I think this little band is the 
real issue,” Nourse said. “One 
Sterrie surgeon, two Cyborgs and 
two viables.” 

“And Durant was ready to kill 
the Sterrie,” Schruille said. 

“No.” It was Calapine. “He 
wasn’t ready to erase anyone.” 
She found herself suddenly inter- 
ested in the train of Nourse’s 
reasoning. It was his logic and 
reason, after all, which had al- 
ways attracted her. 

Schruille, seeing her waver, 
said: “Calapine!” 

“We all saw Durant’s emo- 
tions,” Nourse said. He waved at 
the instrument wall in front of 
him. “He would’ve killed no one. 
He was . educating Svengaard, 
talking to Svengaard with his 
hands.” 

“As they do between them- 
selves, he and his wife,” Calapine 
said. “Certainly!” 

“You say we should raise a 
new crop of doppelgangers,” 
Nourse said. “Which seed shall 
we use? The occupants of Sea- 
tac, perhaps?” 

“We could take the seed cells 
first,” Schruille said, and he won- 
dered how he had been put so 
suddenly on the defensive. “I say 
let’s vote on it. Bring them here 



for full interrogation or destroy 
them.” 

“No need,” Nourse said. “I’ve 
changed my mind. Bring them 
here ... if you can.” 

“Then it’s settled,” Schruille 
said. He rapped the signal into 
his throne arm. “You see, it’s 
really very simple.” 

“Indeed?” Nourse said. “Then 
why do Calapine and I find our- 
selves suddenly reluctant to use 
violence? Why do we long for 
the old ways when Max shielded 
us from ourselves?” 

XXVI 

r T“ , he Hall of Counsel had not 
seen such a gathering since 
the debate over legalizing limited 
Cyborg experiments on their own 
kind some thirty thousand years 
before. The Optimen occupied a 
rainbow splashing of multicol- 
ored cushions on the banks of 
plasmeld benches. Some ap- 
peared nude, but most out of 
awareness of such a gathering’s 
traditional nature came clothed 
in garments of their immediate 
historical whims. There were 
togas, kilts, gowns and ruffs, 
three-cornered hats and derbies, 
G-strings and muumuus, fabrics 
and styles reaching back into 
prehistory. 

Those who could not jam into 
the hall watched through half a 
million scanner eyes that glit- 



146 



GALAXY 



tered around the upper line of 
the walls. 

It was barely daylight over 
Central, but not an Optiman 
slept. 

The Survey Globe had been 
moved aside, and the Tuyere oc- 
cupied a position on the front 
bench center at the end of the 
hall. The prisoners had been 
brought in on a pneumoflot tum- 
bril by acolytes. They sat on the 
tumbril’s flat surface, immobil- 
ized within dull blue plasmeld 
plastrons that permitted only the 
shallowest of breaths. 

As she looked down on them 
from her bench, seeing the five 
figures so rigidly repressed, Cal- 
apine permitted herself a faint 
pity for them. The woman — such 
terror in her eyes. The rage in 
Harvey Durant’s face. The re- 
signed waiting in Glisson and 
Boumour. And Svengaard — a 
look of wary awakening. 

Yet Calapine felt something 
was missing here. She couldn’t 
name the missing thing, felt it 
only as a negative blankness 
within herself. 

Nourse is right, she thought. 
These five are important. 

Some Optiman up near the 
front of the hall had brought a 
tinkle-player, and its little bell 
music could be heard above the 
murmurous whispering of the 
throng in the hall. The sound 
appeared to grow louder as the 



Optimen quieted in anticipation. 
The tinkle-player was stilled in 
mid-melody. 

It grew quieter and quieter in 
the hall. 

Despite her fear, Lizbeth 
stared around her in the growing 
silence. She had never before 
seen an Optiman in the flesh — 
only on the screens of the public 
announcement system. (In her 
lifetime it’d been mostly the 
members of the Tuyere, although 
older Folk mentioned the Kagiss 
trio preceding them.) They 
looked so varied and colorful — 
and so distant. She had the de- 
moralizing feeling that nothing 
of this moment had happened by 
chance, that there was a terrify- 
ing symmetry in being here, now, 
with this company. 

icnphey are completely im- 
mobilized,” Schruille said. 
“There’s nothing to fear.” 

“Yet they are terrified,” 
Nourse said. And he recalled 
suddenly a moment out of his 
youth. He’d been taken to an 
antiquary’s home, one of the hed- 
onists proudly displaying his 
plasmeld copies of lost statues. 
There’d been a giant fish, one 
headless figure on a horse (very 
daring, that), a hooded monk 
and a man and woman clasped 
in a mutual embrace of terror. 
The man and woman, he real- 
ized now, had been recalled by 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



147 



the faces of Lizbeth and Harvey 
Durant. 

They are, in a way, our par- 
ents, Nourse thought. We spring 
from the Folk. 

Calapine realized abruptly 
what it was she missed here. 
There was no Max. He was gone, 
she knew, and she wondered mo- 
mentarily what had happened to 
him. Outgrew his usefulness, she 
decided. The new Max must not 
be ready yet. 

Odd that Max should go just 
like that, she thought. But the 
lives of the Folk were like goss- 
amer. One day you saw them; 
the next day you saw through 
the place where they had been. 
I must ask what happened to 
Max. But she knew she wouldn’t 
ever get around to that. The an- 
swer might require a disgusting 
word, a concept where even eu- 
phemisms would be repellent. 

“Pay particular attention to 
the Cyborg Glisson,” Schruille 
said. “Isn’t it strange that our in- 
struments reflect no emotions 
from him?” 

“Perhaps he has no emotions,” 
Calapine said. 

“Hah!” Schruille barked. 
“Very good.” 

“I don’t trust him,” Nourse 
said. “My grandsir spoke of Cy- 
borg tricks.” 

“He’s virtually a robot,” 
Schruille said. “Programmed to 
respond with the closest precise 



answer to preserve his being. His 
present docility is interesting.” 
“Isn’t it our purpose to inter- 
rogate them?” Nourse asked. 

“In a moment,” Schruille said. 
“We will peel them down to the 
raw brain and open their memo- 
ries to our examination. First, 
it is well to study them.” 

“You’re so callous, Schruille,” 
Calapine said. 

A murmurous agreement 
spread upward through the hall. 

Schruille glanced at her. Cala- 
pine’s voice had sounded so 
strange then. He found himself 
filled with a sudden disquiet. 

Glisson’s Cyborg eyes moved, 
heavy-lidded, coldly probing, 
glistening with their lensed al- 
terations that expanded his spec- 
trum of visibility. 

“Do you see it, Durant?” he 
asked, his voice chopped into 
bits by short breaths. < 

Harvey found his voice. “I . 
can’t . be . lieve . it.” 
“They are talking,” Calapine 
said, her voice bright. She looked 
at the Durant male, surprised 
by a look of loathing and pity 
in his eyes. 

Pity? she wondered. 

A glance at the tiny repeater 
bracelet on her wrist confirmed 
the assessment of the Survey 
Globe. Pity. Pity! How dare he 
pity me! 

“Har . vey,” Lizbeth whis- 
pered. 



148 



GALAXY 



TT'rustrated rage contorted Har- 
vey’s face. He moved his 
eyes, could not quite swing them 
far enough to see her. “Liz,” he 
muttered. “Liz, I love you,” 

“This is a time for hate, not 
love,” Glisson said, his detached 
tone giving the words an air of 
unreality. “Hate and revenge,” 
Glisson said. 

“What are you saying?” Sven- 
gaard asked. He’d listened with 
mounting amazement to their 
words. For a time he’d thought 
of pleading with the Optimen 
that he’d been a prisoner, held 
against his will, but a sixth sense 
told him the attempt would be 
useless. He was nothing to these 
lordly creatures. He was foam 
in the backwash of a wave at a 
cliff base. They were the cliff. 

“Look at them as a doctor,” 
Glisson said. “They are dying.” 

“It’s true,” Harvey said. 

Lizbeth had pressed her eyes 
closed against tears. Now her 
eyes sprang open, and she stared 
up at the people around her, 
seeing them through Harvey’s 
eyes and Glisson’s. 

“They are dying,” she breath- 
ed. 

It was there for the trained 
eyes of an Underground courier 
to read. Mortality on the faces 
of the immortals! Glisson had 
seen it, of course, through his 
Cyborg abilities to see and re- 
spond, read and reflect. 



“The Folk are so disgusting at 
times,” Calapine said. 

“They can’t be,” Svengaard 
said. There was an unreadable 
tone in his voice, and Lizbeth 
wondered at it. The voice lacked 
the despair she could have ex- 
pected. 

“I say they are disgusting!” 
Calapine intoned. “No mere 
pharmacist should contradict 

_ ft 

me. 

Boumour stirred out of a pro- 
found lethargy. The as yet alien 
computer logic within him had 
recorded the conversation, re- 
played it, derived corollary mean- 
ings. He looked up now as a 
new and partial Cyborg, read 
the subtle betrayals in Optiman 
flesh. The thing was there! Some- 
thing had gone wrong with the 
live-forevers. The shock of it left 
Boumour with a half-formed 
feeling of emptiness, as though 
he ought to respond with some 
emotion for which he no longer 
had the capacity. 

“Their words,” Nourse said. “I 
find their conversation mostly 
meaningless. What is it they’re 
saying, Schruille?” 

“Let us ask them now about 
the self-viables,” Calapine said. 
“And the substitute embryo. 
Don’t forget the substitute em- 
bryo.” 

UT ook up there in the top 
J row,” Glisson said. “The

tall one. See the wrinkles on his 
face?” 

“He looks so old,” Lizbeth 
whispered. She felt a curiously 
empty feeling. As long as the 
Optimen were there — unchange- 
able, eternal — her world con- 
tained a foundation that could 
never tremble. Even as she’d op- 
posed them, she’d felt this. Cy- 
borgs died . eventually. The 
Folk died. But Optimen went on 
and on and on . 

“What is it?” Svengaard asked. 
“What’s happening to them?” 

“Second row on the left,” Glis- 
son said. “The woman with red 
hair. See the sunken eyes, the 
stare?” 

Boumour moved his eyes to 
see the woman. Flaws in Opti- 
man flesh leaped out as his gaze 
traversed the short arc permitted 
him. 

“What’re they saying?” Cala- 
pine demanded. “What is this?” 
Her voice sounded querulous 
even to her own ears. She felt 
fretful, annoyed by vague aches. 

A muttering sound of discon- 
tent moved upward through the 
benches. There were little pockets 
of giggling and bursts of peevish 
anger, laughter. 

We’re supposed to interro- 
gate these criminals, Calapine 
thought. When will it start? Must 
I begin it? 

She looked at Schruille. He 
had scrunched down in his seat, 



glaring at Harvey Durant. She 
turned to Nourse, encountered a 
supercilious half-smile on his 
face, a remote look in his eyes. 
There was a throbbing at 
Nourse’s neck she had never no- 
ticed before. A mottled patch of 
red veins stood out on his cheek. 

They leave everything to me, 
she thought. 

XXVII 

XyCTith a fretful movement of 
' ’ her shoulders, she touched 
her bracelet controls. Lambent 
purple light washed over the gi- 
ant globe at the side of the hall. 
A beam of the light spilled out 
from the globe’s top as though 
decanted onto the floor. It reach- 
ed toward the prisoners. 

Schruille watched the play of 
light. Soon the prisoners would 
be raw, shrieking creatures, he 
knew, spilling out all their 
knowledge for the Tuyere’s in- 
struments to analyze. Nothing 
would remain of them except 
nerve fibers along which the 
burning light would spread, 
drinking memories, experiences, 
knowledge. 

“Wait,” Nourse said. 

He studied the light. It had 
stopped its reaching movement 
toward the prisoners at his com- 
mand. He felt they were making 
some gross error known only to 
himself, and he looked around 



150 



GALAXY 



the abruptly silent hall wonder- 
ing if any of the others could 
identify the error or speak it. 
Here was all the secret machinery 
of their government, everything 
planned, ordained. Somehow, the 
inelegant unexpectedness of 
naked Life had entered here. It 
was an error. 

“Why do we wait?” Calapine 
asked. 

Nourse tried to remember. He 
knew he had opposed this action. 
Why? 

Pain ! 

“We must not cause pain,” he 
said. “We must give them the 
chance to speak without duress.” 

“They’ve gone mad,” Lizbeth 
whispered. 

“And we’ve won,” Glisson said. 
“Through my eyes, all my fel- 
lows can see — we’ve won.” 

“They’re going to destroy us,” 
Bourmour said. 

“But we’ve won,” Glisson said. 

“How?” Svengaard asked. And 
louder: “How?” 

“We offered them Potter as 
bait and gave them a taste of 
violence,” Glisson said. “We 
knew they’d look. They had to 
look.” 

“Why?” Svengaard whispered. 

“Because we’ve changed their 
environment,” Glisson said. “Lit- 
tle things, a pressure here, a 
shocking Cyborg there. And we 
gave them a taste for war.” 

“How?” Svengaard asked. 



“Instinct,” Glisson said. The 
word carried a computed finality, 
a sense of inhuman logic from 
which there was no escape. 
“War’s an instinct with humans. 
Battle. Violence. But their sys- 
tems have been maintained in 
delicate balance for so many 
thousands of years. Ah, the price 
they paid — tranquility, detach- 
ment, boredom. Comes now vio- 
lence with its demands, and their 
ability to change has atrophied. 
They’re heterodyning, swaying 
farther and farther from that 
line of perpetual life. Soon 
they’ll die.” 

“War?” Svengaard had heard 
the stories of the violence from 
which the Optimen preserved the 
Folk. Wax. “It can’t be,” he said. 
“There’s some new disease or . .” 

“I have stated the fact as com- 
puted to its ultimate decimal of 
logic,” Glisson said. 

/Calapine screamed: “What’re 
^ J they saying?” 

She could hear the prisoners’ 
words distinctly, but their mean- 
ing eluded her. They were speak- 
ing obscenities. She heard a 
word, registered it, but the next 
word replaced it in her awareness 
without linkage. There was no 
intelligent sequence. Only ob- 
scenities. She rapped Schruille’s 
arm. “What are they saying?” 

“Soon we shall question them 
and discover,” Schruille said. 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



151 



“Yes,” Calapine said. “The 
very thing.” 

“How is it possible?” Sven- 
gaard breathed. He could see 
two couples dancing on the 
benches high up at the back of 
the hall. There were couples em- 
bracing, making love. Two Opti- 
men began shouting at each oth- 
er on his right — nose to nose. 
Svengaard felt that he was 
watching buildings fall, the earth 
open and spew forth flames. 

“Watch them!” Glisson said. 

“Why can’t they just compen- 
sate for this . change?” Sven- 
gaard demanded. 

“Their ability to compensate 
is atrophied,” Glisson said. “And 
you must understand that com- 
pensation itself is a new environ- 
ment. It creates even greater de- 
mands. Look at them! They’re 
oscillating out of control right 
now.” 

“Make them shut up!” Cala- 
pine shouted. She leaped to her 
feet, advanced on the prisoners. 

Harvey watched, fascinated, 
terrified. There was a disjointed 
quality in her movement, in 
every response — except her 
anger. Rage burned at him from 
her eyes. A violent trembling 
swept through his body. 

“You!” Calapine said, point- 
ing at Harvey. “Why do you 
stare at me and mumble? Ans- 
wer!” 

Harvey found himself frozen 



in silence, not by his fear of her 
anger, but by a sudden over- 
whelming awareness of Cala- 
pine’s age. How old was she? 
Thirty thousand years? Forty 
thousand? Was she one of the 
originals — eighty thousand or 
more years old? 

“Speak up and say what you 
will,” Calapine commanded. “I, 
Calapine, order it. Show honor 
now, and perhaps we will be 
lenient.” 

Harvey stared, mute. She 
seemed unaware of the growing 
uproar all around. 

“Durant,” Glisson said. “You 
must remember there are sub- 
terranean things called instincts 
which direct destiny with the 
inexorable flow of a river. This is 
change. See it around us. Change 
is the only constant.” 

“But she’s dying,” Harvey said. 

/Calapine couldn’t make sense of 
his words, but she found 
herself touched by the tone of 
concern for her in his voice. She 
consulted her bracelet linkage 
with the globe. Concern! He was 
worried about her, about Cala- 
pine, not about himself or his 
futile mate! 

She turned into an oddly en- 
folding darkness, collapsed full 
length on the floor with her arms 
outstretched toward the benches. 

A mirthless chuckle escaped 
Glisson’s lips. 



152 



GALAXY 



“We have to do something for 
them,” Harvey said. “They have 
to understand what they’re doing 
to themselves!” 

Schruille stirred suddenly, 
looked up at the opposite wall, 
saw dark patches where scanners 
had been deactivated, aband- 
oned by the Optimen who 
couldn’t jam into the hall. He 
felt an abrupt alarm at the ed- 
dies of movement in the crowd 
all around. Some of the people 
were leaving — swaying, drifting, 
running, laughing, gigging . 

But we came to question the 
prisoners, Schruille thought. 

The hysteria in the hall slow- 
ly impressed itself on Schruille’s 
senses. He looked at Nourse. 

Nourse sat with eyes closed, 
mumbling to himself. “Boiling 
oil,” Nourse said. “But that’s 
too sudden. We need something 
more subtle, more enduring.” 

Schruille leaned forward. “I 
have a question for the man Har- 
vey Durant.” 

“What is it?” Nourse asked. 
He opened his eyes. 

“What did he hope to gain by 
his actions?” Schruille asked. 

“Very good,” Nourse said. 
“Answer the question, Harvey 
Durant.” 

Nourse touched his own brace- 
let. The purple beam of light 
inched closer to the prisoners. 

“I didn’t want you to die,” 
Harvey said. “Not this.” 



“Answer the question!” Schru- 
ille blared. 

Harvey swallowed. “I wanted 
to ... ” 

“We wanted to have a fam- 
ily,” Lizbeth said. She spoke 
clearly, reasonably. “That’s all. 
We wanted to be a family.” Tears 
started in her eyes, and she won- 
dered then what her child would 
have been like. Certainly, none 
of them were going to survive this 
madness. 

“What is this?” Schruille ask- 
ed. “What is this family non- 
sense?” 

“Where did you get the sub- 
stitute embryo?” Nourse asked. 
“Answer, and we may be leni- 
ent.” Again the burning light 
moved toward the prisoners. 

“We have self-viables immune 
to the contraceptive gas,” Glis- 
son said. “Many of them.” 

“You see?” Schruille said. “I 
told you so.” 

“Where are these self-viables?” 
Nourse asked. He felt his right 
hand trembling. 

“Right under your noses,” 
Glisson said. “Scattered through 
the population. And don’t ask 
me to identify them. I don’t know 
them all. No one does.” 

“None will escape us,” Schru- 
ille said. 

“None!” Nourse echoed. 

“If we must,” Schruille said, 
“we’ll sterilize all but Central 
and start over.” 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



153 



C CTTrith what will you start 
’ ’over?” Glisson asked. 
“What?” Schruille screamed the 
word at the Cyborg. 

“Where will you find the gene- 
tic pool from which to start 
over?” Glisson asked. “You are 
sterile — and terminating.” 

“We need but a cell to dupli- 
cate the original,” Schruille said, 
his voice sneering. 

“Then why haven’t you dupli- 
cated yourselves?” Glisson ask- 
ed. 

“You dare question us?” 
Nourse demanded. 

“I will answer for you then,” 
Glisson said. “You’ve not chosen 
duplication because the doppel- 
ganger is unstable. The trend of 
the duplicates is downward — 
extinction.” 

Calapine heard scattered words 
— “Sterile . terminating . 
unstable . extinction . .” 
They were hideous words that 
crept down into the depths where 
she lay watching a string of fat 
sausages parade in glowing order 
before her awareness. They were 
like seeds with a lambent radi- 
ance moving against a back- 
ground of oiled black velvet. 
Sausages. Seeds. She saw them 
then not precisely as seeds, but 
as encapsulated life — walled 
in, shielded, bridging a period 
unfavorable to life. It made the 
idea of seeds less repellent to 
her. They were life. 



“We don’t need the genetic 
pool,” Schruille said. 

Calapine heard his voice clear- 
ly, felt she could read his 
thoughts. Words out of one of 
the glowing sausages forced 
themselves upon her: We have 
our millions in Central. We are 
enough by ourselves. Feeble, 
short-lived Folk are a disgusting 
reminder of our past. They 'are 
pets, and we no longer need pets. 

“I’ve decided what we can do 
to these criminals,” Nourse said. 
He spoke loudly to force his 
voice over the growing hubub 
in the hall. “We will apply nerve 
excitation a micron at a time. 
The pain will be exquisite and 
can be drawn out for centuries.” 

“But you said you didn’t want 
to cause pain,” Schruille shouted. 

“Didn’t I?” Nourse’s voice 
sounded worried. 

7 don’t feel well, Calapine 
thought. 7 need a long session in 
the pharmacy. Pharmacy. The 
word was a switch that turned 
on her consciousness. She felt 
her body stretched out on the 
floor, pain and wetness at her 
nose where it had struck the 
floor in her fall. 

“Your suggestion contains 
some merit, however,” Schruille 
said. “We could restore the 
nerves behind our ministrations 
and carry on the punishment in- 
definitely. Exquisite pain for- 
ever!” 



154 



GALAXY 



“A hell,” Nourse said. “Appro- 
priate.” 

“They’re insane enough to do 
it,” Svengaard rasped. “How can 
we stop them?” 

“Glisson!” Lizbeth said. “Do 
something!” 

But the Cyborg remained si- 
lent. 

CC'TT'his is something you didn’t 
anticipate, isn’t it, Glis- 
son?” Svengaard said. 

Still the Cyborg held to silence. 

“Answer me!” Svengaard grat- 
ed. 

“They were just suppose to 
die,” Glisson said, voice dispas- 
sionate. 

“But now they could sterilize 
all the earth except Central and 
go on in their madness by them- 
selves,” Svengaard said. “And we 
could be tortured forever!” 

“Not forever,” Glisson said. 
“They’re dying.” 

A cheer went up from the Op- 
timen at the rear of the hall. 
None of the prisoners could turn 
to see what had aroused the 
sound, but it added a new dimen- 
sion to the sense of urgency 
around them. 

Calapine lifted herself from the 
floor. Her nose and mouth throb- 
bed with pain. She turned toward 
the tumbril, saw a commotion 
among the Optimen beyond it. 
They were leaping on benches 
to watch some excited activity 

HEISENBERG'S EYES 



hidden in their midst. A naked 
body lifted suddenly above the 
throng, turned over and went 
down again with a sodden thump. 
Again a cheer shook the hall. 

What’ re they doing? Calapine 
wondered. They’re hurting each 
other — themselves ! 

She wiped a hand across her 
nose and mouth, looked at the 
hand. Blood. She could smell it 
now, a tantalizing smell. Her 
own blood. It fascinated her. She 
crossed to the prisoners, showed 
the hand to Harvey Durant. 

“Blood,” she said. She touched 
her nose. Pain! “It hurts,” she 
said. “Why does it hurt, Harvey 
Durant?” She stared into his 
eyes. Such sympathy in his eyes. 
He was human. He cared. 

Harvey looked at her, their 
eyes almost level because of the 
tumbril’s position above the floor. 
He felt a profound compassion 
for her suddenly. She was Liz- 
beth; she was Calapine; she was 
all women. He saw the concen- 
trated intensity of her attention, 

the here-now awareness which 
/ 

excluded everything except her 
need for his words. 

“It hurts me, too, Calapine,” 
he said, “but your death would 
hurt me more.” 

XXVIII 

't'or an instant, Calapine 
^ thought the hall had grown 



155 



still around her. She realized 
then that the noises of the throng 
continued unabated. She could 
hear Nourse chanting: “Good! 
Good!” and Schruille saying: 
“Excellent! Excellent!” 

She realized then that she had 
been the only one to hear Du- 
rant’s hideous words. It was blas- 
phemy. She’d lived thousands of 
years suppressing the very con- 
cept of personal death. It could 
not be said or conceived in the 
mind. But she had heard the 
words! She wanted to turn away, 
to believe those words had never 
happened. But something of the 
attention she had focused on 
Harvey Durant held her chained 
to his meaning. Only minutes ago, 
she had been where the seed of 
life spanned the eons. She had 
felt the wild presence of forces 
that could move within the mito- 
chondrial structures of the cells. 

“Please,” Lizbeth whispered. 
“Free us. You’re a woman. You 
must have some compassion. 
What have we done to harm 
you? Is it wrong to want love 
and life? We didn’t want to harm 
you.” 

Calapine gave no sign that she 
heard. There were only Harvey’s 
words playing over and over in 
her mind: “Your death . your 
death . your death . your 
death . .” 

Odd flickerings of heat and 
chill surged through her body. 



She heard another cheer from 
the crowd in the far benches. She 
felt her own sickness and grow- 
ing awareness of the cul de sac 
in which she had been trapped. 
Anger suffused her. She bent to 
the tumbril’s controls, punched 
a button beneath Glisson. 

The carapaces of the shell 
which held the Cyborg began 
closing. Glisson’s eyes opened 
wide. A rasping moan escaped 
him. Calapine giggled, punched 
another button on the controls. 
The shells snapped to their form- 
er position. Glisson gasped. 

She turned to the controls be- 
neath Harvey, poised a finger 
over the buttons. “Explain your 
disgusting breach of manners!” 

Harvey remained frozen in si- 
lence. She was going to crush 
him! 

Svengaard began to laugh. He 
knew his own position, the first- 
class second-rater. Why had he 
been chosen for this moment — 
to see Glisson and Boumour 
without words, Nourse and 
Schruille babbling on their bench, 
the Optimen in little knots and 
eddies of mad violence, Calapine 
ready to kill her prisoners and 
doubtless forget it ten seconds 
later? His laughter went out of 
control. 

“Stop that laughing!” Calapine 
screamed. 

Svengaard trembled with hys- 
teria. He gasped for breath. The 



156 



GALAXY 



shock of her voice helped him 
gain a measure of control, but it 
still was immensely ludicrous. 

“Fool!” Calapine said. “Ex- 
plain yourself.” 

Svengaard stared at her. He 
could feel only pity now. He re- 
membered the sea from the 
medical resort at Lapush and 
he thought he saw now why the 
Optimen had chosen this place 
so far from any ocean. Instinct. 
The sea produced waves, surf — 
constant reminder that they had 
set themselves against eternity’s 
waves. They could not face that. 

“Answer me,” Calapine said. 
Her hand hovered above his 
shell’s controls. 

O vengaard could only stare at 
^ her and at the Optimen in 
their madness beyond her. They 
stood exposed before him as 
though their bodies had been 
opened to spill twisting entrails 
on the floor. 

They have souls with only one 
scar, Svengaard thought. 

It was carved on them day by 
day, century by century, eon by 
eon — the increment of panic 
that their blessed forevemess 
might be illusion, that it might 
after all have an ending. He had 
never before suspected the price 
the Optimen paid for infinity. 
The more of it they possessed, 
the greater its value. The greater 
the value, the greater the fear of 



losing it. The pressure went up 
and up . forever. 

But there had to be a break- 
ing point. The Cyborgs had seen 
this but had missed the real con- 
sequences. 

The Optimen had themselves 
hemmed in with euphemisms. 
They had pharmacists, not doc- 
tors. Because doctors meant sick- 
ness and injury, and that equall- 
ed the unthinkable. They had 
only their pharmacy and its 
countless outlets never more than 
a few steps from any Optiman. 
They never left Central and its 
elaborate safeguards. They ex- 
isted as perpetual adolescents in 
their nursery prison. 

“So you won’t speak,” Cala- 
pine said. 

“Wait,” Svengaard said as her 
hand moved toward the buttons 
beneath him. “When you’ve kill- 
ed all the viables and only you 
remain, when you see yourselves 
dying one by one, what then?” 

“How dare you?” She said. 
“You think to question an Opti- 
man whose experience of life 
makes yours no more than that!” 
She snapped her fingers. 

He looked at her bruised nose, 
the blood. 

“Optiman,” Svengaard said. 
“A Sterrie whose constitution will 
accept the enzyme adjustment 
for infinite life . until destruc- 
tion comes from within. I think 
you want to die.” 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



157 



Calapine drew herself up, 
glared at him. As she did, she 
became aware of a sudden odd 
silence in the hall. She swept a 
glance around her, saw intent 
watchfulness in every eye fo- 
cused upon her. Realization came 
slowly. They see the blood on 
my face. 

“You had infinite life,” Sven- 
gaard said. “Does that make you 
necessarily more brilliant, more 
intelligent? No. You merely 
lived longer, had more time for 
experience and education. Very 
likely, most of you are educated 
beyond your intelligence, else 
you’d have seen long ago that 
this moment was inevitable — 
the delicate balance destroyed, 
all of you dying.” 

Calapine took a step back- 
ward. His words were like pain- 
ful knives burning into her 
nerves. 

“Look at you!” Svengaard 
said. “All of you sick. What does 
your precious Pharmacy do? I 
knew without being told: it pre- 
scribes wider and wider variant 
prescriptions, more frequent dos- 
ages. It’s trying to check the os- 
cillations because that’s how it’s 
programmed. It’ll go on trying as 
long as you permit it . but it 
won’t save you.” 

S omeone screamed behind her: 
“Silence him!” 

The cry was taken up around 



the hall, a deafening chant, foot 
stamping, hands pounding: “Si- 
lence him! Si-lence him! 

Calapine pressed her hands to 
her ears. She could still feel the 
chant through her skin. And now 
she saw Optimen start down off 
the benches toward the prison- 
ers. She knew bloody violence 
was only a heartbeat away. 

They stopped. 

She couldn’t understand why 
and dropped her hands away 
from her ears. Screams rained 
down on her. The names of half- 
forgotten deities were invoked. 
Eyes stared at something on the 
floor at the head of the hall. 

Calapine whirled, saw Nourse 
writhing there, foamy spittle 
around his mouth. His skin was 
a mottled reddish purple and 
yellow. Clawed hands reached 
out, scraped the floor. 

“Do something!” Svengaard 
shouted. “He’s dying!” Even as 
he shouted, he felt the strange- 
ness of his words. Do something] 
His medical training surfaced 
and spoke no matter what hap- 
pened. 

Calapine backed away, put out 
her hands in a warding gesture 
as old as witchcraft. Sehruille 
leaped up, stood on the bench 
where he’d been sitting. His 
mouth moved soundlessly. 

“Calapine,” Svengaard said- 
“If you won’t help him, release 
me so I can do it.” 



158 



GALAXY 



She leaped to obey, filled with 
gratitude that she could give this 
hideous responsibility to another. 

The restraining shells fell away 
at her touch. Svengaard leaped 
down, almost fell. His legs and 
arms tingled from the long con- 
finement. He limped toward 
Nourse, his eyes and mind work- 
ing as he moved. Mottled yellow 
in the skin — most probably 'an 
immune reaction to pantothenic 
acid and a failure of adrenalin 
suppression. 

The red triangle of a Pharma- 
cy outlet glowed on the wall at 
his left above the benches. 
Svengaard stooped, picked up 
Nourse’s writhing form, began 
climbing toward the symbol. The 
man was a sudden dead weight in 
his arms, no movement except a 
shallow lifting of the breast. 

Optimen fell back from him 
as though he carried plague. 
Abruptly, someone above him 
shouted: “Let me out!” 

The mob turned away. Feet 
pounded on the plasmeld. They 
jammed up at the exits, clawed 
and climbed over one another. 
There were screams, curses, 
hoarse shouts. It was like a cattle 
pen with a predator loose in the 
midst of the animals. 

Part of Svengaard’s awareness 
registered on a woman at his 
right. He passed her. She lay 
stretched across two banks of 
seats, her back at an odd angle, 

HEISENBERG'S EYES 



mouth gaping, eyes staring, blood 
on her arms and neck. There 
was no sign of breath. He climb- 
ed past a man who dragged him- 
self up the tiered benches, one 
leg useless, his eyes intent on an 
exit sign and a doorway which 
appeared to be filled with writh- 
ing shapes. 

Ovengaard’s arms ached from 
^ his load. He stumbled, al- 
most fell up the last two steps 
as he eased Nourse to the floor 
beside the Pharmacy outlet. 

There were voices down behind 
him now — Durant and Boumour 
shouting to be released. 

Later, Svengaard thought. He 
put his hand to the door control 
on the Pharmacy outlet. The 
doors refused to open. Of course, 
he thought. I’m not an Optiman. 
He lifted Nourse, put one of the 
Optiman’s hands to the control. 
The doors slid aside. Behind 
them lay what appeared to be 
the standard presentation of a 
priority rack — pyrimidines, an- 
eurin . 

Aneurin and inositol, he 
thought. Got to counteract the 
immune reaction. 

A familiar flow-analysis board 
occupied the right side, with a 
gap for insertion of an arm and 
the usual vampire needles pro- 
truding from their gauges. Sven- 
gaard tripped the keys on the 
master flow gauge, opened the 



159 



panel . He traced back the aneurin 
and inositol feeders, immobilized 
the others, thrust Nourse’s arm 
beneath the needles. They found 
veins, dipped into flesh. Gauges 
kicked over. 

Svengaard pinched off the re- 
turn line to stop feedback. Again 
the gauges kicked over. 

Gently, Svengaard disengaged 
Nourse’s arm from the needles, 
stretched him on the floor. His 
face was now a uniform pale 
white, but his breathing had 
deepened. His eyelids flickered. 
His flesh felt cold, clammy. 

Shock, Svengaard thought. He 
removed his own jacket, put it 
around Svengaard, began mas- 
saging the arms to restore circu- 
lation. 

Calapine came into view on his 
right, sat down at Nourse’s head. 
Her hands were clasped tightly 
together, knuckles white. There 
was an odd clarity in her face, 
the eyes with a look of staring 
into distances. She felt she had 
come a much farther distance 
than up from the floor of the 
hall, drawn by memories that 
would not be denied. She knew 
she had gone through madness 
into an oddly detached sanity. 

The fed ball of the Survey 
Globe caught her eye, the egg of 
enormous power that did her 
bidding even now. She thought 
about Nourse, her many-times 
playmate. Playmate and toys. 



“Will he die?” she asked. She 
turned to watch Svengaard. 

“Not immediately,” Svengaard 
said. “But that final burst of 
hysteria . he’s done irrepar- 
able damage to his system.” 

He grew aware that there were 
only muted moans and a very 
few controlled commands in the 
hall now. Some of the acolytes 
had rallied to help. 

“I released Boumour and the 
Durants and sent a plea for more 
. medical help,” Calapine 
said. “There are a number of 
. dead . many injured.” 
Dead, she thought. What an 
odd word to apply to an Opti- 
man. Dead . dead . ddad . 

S he felt then how necessity had 
forced her into a new kind 
of living awareness, a new rhy- 
thm. It had happened down 
there in a burst of memories that 
trailed through forty thousand 
years. None of it escaped her — 
not a moment of kindness nor of 
brutality. She remembered all the 
Max Allgoods, Seatac . every 
lover, every toy . Nourse. 

Svengaard glanced around at 
a shuffling sound, saw Boumour 
approaching with a woman limp 
in his arms. There was a blue 
bruise across her cheek and jaw. 
Her arms hung like sticks. 

“Is this Pharmacy outlet avail- 
able?” Boumour asked. His voice 
held that chilled Cyborg quality, 



160 



GALAXY 



but there was shock in his eyes 
and a touch of horror. 

“You’ll have to operate the 
board manually,” Svengaard said. 
“I keyed out the demand sys- 
tem, jammed the feedback.” 
Boumour stepped heavily 
around him with the woman. 
How fragile she looked. A vein 
pulsed thickly at her neck. 

“I must concoct a muscle re- 
laxant until we can get her to a 
hospital,” Boumour said. “She 
broke her own arms — contra- 
muscular strain.” 

Calapine recognized the face, 
remembered they had disputed 
mildly about a man once — 
about a playmate. 

Svengaard moved to Nourse’s 
right arm, continued massaging. 
The move brought the floor of 
the hall into view and the tum- 
bril. Glisson sat impassively arm- 
less in his restraining shell. Liz- 
beth lay at one side with Harvey 
kneeling beside her. 

“Mrs. Durant!” Svengaard 
said, remembering his obligation. 

“She’s all right,” Boumour 
said. “Immobilization for the past 
few hours was the best thing that 
could’ve happened to her.” 

Rest thing! Svengaard thought. 
Durant was right-, these Cyborgs 
are as insensitive (as machines. 

“Si-lonce him,” Nourse whis- 
pered. 

Svengaard looked down at the 
pale face, saw the broken veins 



in the cheeks, the sagging, un- 
responsive flesh. Nourse’s eye- 
lids flickered open. 

“Leave him to me,” Calapine 
said. 

Nourse moved his head, tried 
to look at her. He blinked, hav- 
ing obvious trouble focusing. His 
eyes began to water. 

Calapine lifted his head, slid 
under him until he rested on her 
lap. She began stroking his brow. 

“He used to like this,” she 
said. “Go help the others . 
doctor.” 

“Cal,” Nourse said. “Oh, Cal 
. I . hurt.” 

XXIX 

CC'\X7'hy do you help them?” 
* * Glisson asked. “I don’t 
understand you, Boumour. Your 
actions aren’t logical. What use 
is it to help them?” 

He looked up through the open 
segment of the Survey globe at 
Calapine sitting alone on the dais 
of the Tuyere. The lights of the 
interior played a slow rhythm 
across her face. A glowing pyra- 
mid of projected binaries danced 
on the air in front of her. 

Glisson had been released from 
his shell of restraint, but he still 
sat on the tumbril, his arm con- 
nections dangling empty. A me- 
dicouch had been brought in for 
Lizbeth Durant. She lay on it, 
with Harvey seated beside her. 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



161 



Boumour stood with his back to 
Glisson looking up into the globe. 
His fingers moved nervously, 
clenching, opening. There was a 
streak of dried blood down his 
right sleeve. The elfin face held 
a look of puzzlement. 

Svengaard came in from be- 
hind the globe, a slowly moving 
figure in the red shadows. 
Abruptly, the hall glared with 
light. The main globes had gone 
on automatically as darkness fell 
outside. Svengaard stopped to 
check Lizbeth, patted Harvey’s 
shoulder. “She will be all right. 
She’s strong.” 

Lizbeth’s eyes followed him as 
he moved around to look into 
the Survey Globe. Svengaard’s 
shoulders sagged with fatigue, 
but there was a look of elation 
in his face. He was a man who’d 
found himself. 

“Calapine,” Svengaard said, 
“that was the last of them going 
out to hospitals.” 

“I see it,” she said. She looked 
up at the scanners, every one 
lighted. Something more than 
half of the Optimen were under 
restraint — mad. Thousands had 
died. More thousands lay sorely 
injured. Those who remained 
watched their globe. She sighed, 
wondering at their thoughts, 
wondering how they faced the 
fact that all had fallen from the 
tight wire of immortality. Her 
own emotions confused her. 



There was an odd feeling of re- 
lief in her breast. 

“What of Schruille?’ she ask- 
ed. 

“Crushed at a door,” Sven- 
gaard said. “He’s . dead.” 

She sighed. “And Nourse?” 

“Responding to treatment.” 

UTAon’t you understand 
what’s happened to you?” 
Glisson demanded. His eyes glit- 
tered as he stared up at Calapine. 

Calapine looked down at him, 
spoke clearly: “We’ve undergone 
an emotional stress that has al- 
tered the delicate balance of our 
metabolism.” she said. “You 
tricked us into it. The evidence 
is quite clear — there’s no turn- 
ing back.” 

“Then you understand,” Glis- 
son said. “Any attempt to 
force your systems back into the 
old forms will result in boredom 
and a gradual descent into apa- 
thy.” 

Calapine smiled. “Yes, Glisson. 
We’d not want that. We’ve been 
addicted to a new kind of . 
aliveness that we didn’t know 
existed.” 

“Then you do understand,” 
Glisson said, and there was a 
grudging quality to his voice. 

“We broke the rhythm of life,” 
Calapine said. “All life is im- 
mersed in rhythm, but we got 
out of step. I suppose that was 
the outside interference in those 



162 



GALAXY 



embryos — rhythm asserting it- 
self.” 

“Well then,” Glisson said, “the 
sooner you can turn things over 
to us, the sooner things will set- 
tle down into . .” 

“To you?” Calapine asked 
scornfully. She looked out into 
the quick contrasts of the hall’s 
glaring light. How black and 
white it all was. “I’d sooner con- 
demn us all,” she said. 

“But you’re dying!” 

“So are you,” Calapine said. 

Svengaard swallowed. He 
could see that the old animos- 
ities would not be suppressed 
easily. And he wondered at him- 
self, a second-rate surgeon who 
had suddenly found himself as a 
doctor, ministering to people who 
needed him. Durant had seen 
that — the need to be needed. 

“I may have a plan we could 
accept, Calapine,” Svengaard 
said. 

“To you we will listen,” Cala- 
pine said, and there was affec- 
tion in her voice. She studied 
Svengaard as he searched for 
words, remembering that this 
man had saved the lives of 
Nourse and many others. 

We made no plans for the un- 
thinkable, she thought. Is it pos- 
sible that this nobody who was 
once a target for kindly sneers 
can save us? She dared not let 
herself hope. 

“The Cyborgs have techniques 



for bringing the emotions into 
a more or less manageable 
stasis,” Svengaard said. “Once 
that’s done, I believe I know a 
way to dampen the enzymic os- 
cillations in most of you.” 

/Calapine swallowed. The scan- 
^ ner-eye lights above her be- 
gan to flash as the watchers 
signaled for her to let them into 
the communications channels. 
They had questions, of course. 
She had questions of her own, 
but she didn’t know that she 
could speak them. She caught a 
reflection of her own face in one 
of the prisms, was reminded of 
the look in Lizbeth’s eyes as the 
woman had pleaded from the 
tumbril. 

“I can’t promise infinite life,” 
Svengaard said, “but I believe 
many of you can have many 
more thousands of years.” 

“Why should we agree to help 
them?” Glisson demanded. There 
was a measuring quality in her 
voice, a hint of the querulous. 

“You’re failures, too!” Sven- 
gaard said. “Can’t you see that?” 
He realized he had shouted with 
the full power of his disillusion- 
ment. 

“Don’t shout at me!” Glisson 
snapped. 

So they do have emotions , 
Svengaard thought. Pride , . 
anger . 

“Are you still suffering under 

163 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



the delusion that you’re in con- 
trol of this situation?” Svengaard 
asked. He pointed to Calapine. 
“That one woman up there could 
still exterminate every non-Opti- 
man on earth.” 

“Listen to him, you Cyborg 
fool!” Calapine said. 

“Let’s not be too free with 
that word fool,” Svengaard said. 
He stared up at Calapine. 

“Watch your tongue, Sven- 
gaard,” Calapine said. “Our pati- 
ence is not infinite.” 

“Nor is your gratitude, eh?” 
Svengaard said. 

A bitter smile touched her 
mouth. “We were talking about 
survival,” she said. 

Svengaard sighed. He wonder- 
ed then if the patterns of thought 
conditioned by the illusion of in- 
finite life could ever be truly 
broken. She had spoken there 
like the old Tuyere. But her 
resiliency had surprised him be- 
fore. 

The outburst had touched 
Harvey’s fears for Lizbeth. He 
glared at Svengaard and Glisson, 
tried to control his terror and 
rage. This hall awed him with 
its immensity and its remem- 
bered bedlam. The globe towered 
over, him, a monstrous force that 
could crush them. 

“Survival, then,” Svengaard 
said. 

“Let us understand each oth- 
er,” Calapine said. “There are 

164 



those among us who will say 
that your help was merely our 
due. You are still our captives. 
There are those who’ll demand 
you submit and reveal your en- 
tire Underground to us.” 

“Yes, let us understand each 
other,” Svengaard said. “Who 
are your prisoners? Myself, a per- 
son who was not a member of 
the Underground and knows lit- 
tle about it. You have Glisson, 
who knows more, but assuredly 
not all. You have Boumour, one 
of your escaped pharmacists, 
who knows even less than Glis- 
son. You have the Durants, 
whose knowledge probably goes 
little beyond their own cell 
group. What will you gain even 
if you milk us dry?” 

“Your plan to save us,” Cala- 
pine said. 

“My plan requires cooperation, 
not coercion,” Svengaard said. 

“And it will only give us at 
continuation, not restore us to 
our original condition, is that 
it?” Calapine asked. 

“You should welcome that,” 
Svengaard said. “It would give 
you a chance to mature, become 
useful.” He waved a hand to in- 
dicate their surroundings. “You’ve 
frozen yourselves in immaturity 
here! You’ve played with toys! 
I’m offering you a chance to 
live!” 

Is that it? Calapine wondered. 
Is this new aliveness a bypro- 



GALAXY 



duct of the knowledge that we 
must die? 

“I’m not at all sure we’ll co- 
operate,” Glisson said. 

TTarvey had had enough. He 
^ leaped to his feet, glared at 
Glisson. “You want the human 
race to die, you robot! You! 
You’re another dead end!” 
“Prattle!” Glisson said. 
“Listen,” Calapine said. She 
began sampling the communica- 
tions channels. Bits of sentences 
poured out into the hall — 

“We can restore enzymic bal- 
ance with our own resources!” 
. “Eliminate these creatures!” 
. “What’s his plan? What’s his 
plan?” . “Begin the steriliza- 
tion!” his plan?”... 

“How long do we have if . 

. “There’s no doubt we can . .” 
Calapine silenced the voices 
with a flick of a switch. “It will 
be put to a vote,” she said. “I 
remind you of that.” 

“You will die, and soon, if we 
don’t cooperate,” Glisson said. “I 
want that fully understood.” 
“You know Svengaard’s plan?” 
Calapine asked. 

“His thought patterns are 
transparent,” Glisson said. 

“I think not,” Calapine said. 
“I saw him work on Nourse. He 
manipulated a dispensary to pro- 
duce a dangerous overdose of 
aneurin and inositol. Remember- 
ing that, I ask myself how many 

HEISENBERG'S EYES 



of us will die in the attempt to 
arrest this process we can all 
feel within ourselves. Would I 
have risked such an overdose up- 
on myself? How does this relate 
to the excitement we feel? Will 
any of us, having tasted excite- 
ment, wish to sink back into a 
non-emotional . boredom?” 
She looked at Svengaard. “These 
are some of my questions.” 

“I know his plan,” Glisson 
sneered. “Quell your emotions 
and implant an enzymic dispen- 
sary within each of you. Make 
Cyborgs of you.” A tight grin 
etched a line of teeth in Glisson’s 
face. “It’s your only hope. Ac- 
cepting it, you will have lost to 
us at last!” 

Calapine glared down at him. 

Harvey was caught by the 
carping meanness in Glisson’s 
voice. His own schism from the 
Underground had always known 
the Cyborgs were too calculating 
and narrow-minded to be trusted 
with purely human decisions, but 
he had never before seen the 
fact so clearly demonstrated. 

“Is that your plan, Sven- 
gaard?” Calapine demanded. 

Harvey jumped up. “No! 
That’s not his plan!” 

Svengaard nodded to himself. 
Of course! A fellow human, and 
a father would know. 

“You pretend to know what 
I, a Cyborg, do not know?” Glis- 
son asked. 



165 




Svengaard looked at Harvey 
with raised eyebrows. 

“Embryos,” Harvey said. 

Svengaard nodded, looked up 
at Calapine. “I propose to keep 
you continually implanted with 
living embryos,” he said. “Living 
monitors that will make you ad- 
just to your own needs. You 
will regain your emotions, your 
. zest for life, this excitement 
you prizg . 

“You propose to make of us 
living vats for embryos?” Cala- 
pine asked, wonder in her voice. 

“The gestation process can be 
delayed for hundreds of years,” 
Svengaard said. “With proper 
hormone adjustment, this can be 
applied even to men. Caesarian 



delivery, of course, but it need 
not be painful ... or frequent.” 

XXX 

/Calapine weighed his words, 
wondering why she felt no 
disgust at the suggestion. 

Once she had felt disgust at 
the realization that Lizbeth 
Durant carried an embryo with- 
in her; but Calapine realized now 
her disgust had been compound- 
ed of jealousy. Not all the Opti- 
men would accept this, she knew. 
Some would hope for a return to 
the old ways. She looked up at 
the globe’s telltales. No one had 
escaped the poisoning excite- 
ment, though. They would have 



166 



GALAXY 





to understand that everyone was 
going to die . sooner or later. 
Choice of time was all they had. 

We didn’t have immortality 
after all, she thought, only the 
illusion. We had that, though . 
for eons. 

“Calapine!” Glisson said. 
“You’re not going to accept this 
. this foolish proposal?” 

The mechanical man is out- 
raged at 'a living solution, she 
thought. She said: “Boumour, 
what do you say?” 

“Yes,” Glisson said, “speak up, 
Boumour. Point out the illogic- 
ality of this . proposal.” 
Boumour turned, studied Glis- 
son, glanced at Svengaard and 
the Durants, stared up at Cala- 



pine. There was a look of secret 
wisdom in Boumour’s pinched 
face. “I can still remember . 
how it was,” he said. “I . think 
it was better . before I . 
was changed.” 

“Boumour!” Glisson said. 

Hit him in his pride, Svengaard 
thought. 

Glisson glared up at Calapine 
with mechanical intensity. “It’s 
not yet determined that well 
help you!” 

“Who needs you?” Svengaard 
asked. “You’ve no monopoly on 
your techniques. You’d save a 
little time and trouble, that’s all. 
We can find embryos.” 

Glisson stared from one to the 
other. “But this isn’t the way it 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



167 



was computed You’re not sup- 
posed to help them!” 

The Cyborg fell silent, eyes 
glassy. 

“Doctor Svengaard,” Calapine 
said, “could you give us elite, 
viable embryos such as the Du- 
rant’s? You saw the arginine in 
trusion. Nourse believes this pos- 
sible.” 

“It’s possible,” Svengaard said. 
He considered. “Yes, it’s . 
probable.” 

Calapine looked up at the 
scanners. “If we accept this of- 
fer,” she said, “we go on living. 
You feel it? We’re alive now, but 
we can remember a recent time 
when we weren’t alive.” 

“We’ll help if we must,” Glis- 
son said, and there was that carp- 
ing tone in his voice. 

Only Lizbeth, realizing her 
own bucolic docility in pregnan- 
cy, recognizing the flattening 
tenor of her emotions, suspected 
the logidal fact which had swayed 
the Cyborg. 

Docile people could be con- 
trolled. That’s what Glisson was 
thinking. She could read it in 
him, understanding him fully for 
the first time now that she knew 
he had pride and anger. 

/Calapine, reading on the Sur- 
vey Globe’s wall the mount- 
ing pressure of a single question 
from her Optiman audience, set 
up the analogues for an answer. 



It came swiftly for the scanners 
to see: “This process could pro- 
vide eight to twelve thousand 
years of additional life even for 
the Folk.” 

“Even for the Folk,” Calapine 
whispered. They’d discover this, 
she knew. There could be no 
more Security now. Even the 
Survey Globe had been shown 
to have flaws and limits. Glisson 
knew it. She could tell this, read- 
ing his silent withdrawal down 
there. Svengaard certainly would 
realize it. Possibly even the Du- 
rants. 

She looked at Svengaard, 
knowing what she had to do. It 
would be easy to lose the Folk 
in this moment, lose them com- 
pletely. 

“If it is done,” Calapine said, 
“it will be done for anyone who 
wishes it — Folk or Optiman.” 

This is politics, she thought. 
This is the way the Tuyere 
would do it .. evert Schruille. 
Especially Schruille. Clever Sch- 
ruille. Dead Schruille. She could 
almost hear him chuckling. 

“Can it be done for the Folk?” 
Harvey asked. 

“For anyone,” she said, and 
she smiled at Glisson, letting him 
see how she’d won. "I think we 
can put it to a vote now.” 

Once more, she looked up at 
the scanners, wondering if she’d 
gauged her people correctly. 
Most of them would see what 



168 



GALAXY 



she’d done, of course. But there’d 
be some clinging to the hope they 
could restore complete enzymic 
balance. She knew better. Her 
body knew. But some might 
choose to try that dangerous 
course back to boredom and apa- 
thy. 

“Green for acceptance of Doc- 
tor Svengaard’s proposal,” she 
^aid. “Gold against.” 

Slowly, then with cumulating 
speed, the circle of scanner lights 
changed color — green . green 
. great washes of it with only 
here and there a dot or pocket 
of gold. It was a more over- 
whelming acceptance than she’d 
expected, and this made her ed- 
gy, suspicious. She trusted her 
voting instincts. Overwhelming 
acceptance. She consulted the 
globe’s instruments, read the 
presentation of the answer: “The 
Cyborg can be maneuvered 
through its belief in the omni- 
potence of logic.” 

Calapine nodded to herself, 
thinking of her madness. And 
Life cannot be totally maneuver- 
ed against the interests of living, 
she thought. 

4C'T'he proposal is accepted,” 
she said. 

And she found she did not like 
the sudden pouncing look on 



Glisson’s face. We’ve overlooked 
something, she thought. But we’ll 
find it .. once we’re newly ad- 
justed. 

Svengaard turned to look at 
Harvey Durant .allowed himself 
a broad grin. This was like the 
operating room, he thought. One 
shaped minutia, and the broad 
pattern followed. It could be done 
with precision even as it was 
done down in the cell. 

Harvey weighed Svengaard’s 
grin, read the emotional betray- 
als on the man’s face. All the 
faces around him carried their 
own exposure in this instant, all 
open to be read by a courier 
trained in the Underground. It 
was a standoff between the 
powerful. 

The Folk might yet have a 
chance — thousands of years of 
chance ... if Calapine were to 
be believed — and she believed 
it herself. The genetic environ- 
ment had been shaped into a 
new pattern, and he could see it. 
This was an indefinite pattern, 
full of indeterminancy. Heisen- 
berg would’ve liked this pattern. 
The movers themselves had been 
moved (and changed) by mov- 
ing. 

“When can Lizbeth and I 
leave here?” Harvey asked.

Who is Human? 

by HAYDEN HOWARD 



Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



West was known as the murderer 
of Eskimos — But now one of his 
victims was trying to kill him! 



I 

S tinging snow particles shot 
across the dim igloo. The 
three men and the woman 
blinked at the small bright hole 
which appeared in the snow wall. 
The muffled sound from out- 
side must have come from a 
rifle. 

Dr. West smiled wryly and 
slid off the sleeping-ledge on to 
the icy floor. “I believe we’ve 
finally found Peterluk.” 



A second spray of snow, ac- 
companied by a distant rifle re- 
port, brought Councilor LaRue 
erect in the igloo. “Mon dieu, the 
man is berserk — or has formid- 
able humor.” He heaved his bulk 
toward the low exit tunnel. Head 
and shoulders committed, he 
changed his mind and buttocked 
against Dr. West. “No doubt this 
Peterluk shoots only at stran- 
gers?” 

Both whitemen glanced up at 
their guide. The young Esk, with 



170 



a smile as quizzical as an Eski- 
mo’s, was kneeling on the skin- 
covered ledge, poking his fin- 
ger into the upper bullet hole. 

“Get down here,” Dr. West 
said, and the Esk peered down 
at them, smiled like a Cheshire 
cat in the dimness of the igloo 
and slid down beside them, his 
hand groping. 

The Esk grunted with pleas- 
ure, having discovered an uni- 
dentifiable glob of meat which 
the escaped Peterluk had dis- 
carded. The young Esk’s chewing 
sounds were punctuated by 
Eevvaalik’s tubercular coughing 
from the other sleeping platform. 
Even now while some people 
walked on the Moon, others 
lived like this. 

In the cold stench, Eewaalik 
sat trimming the seal oil lamp as 
intently as if her husband, Peter- 
luk, were not shooting into the 
igloo. 

C 4 'C' ewaalik, a bullet might 
hit you,” Dr. West said. 
“Come down here.” 

With a sliver of bone, Eewaal- 
ik expertly pressed the smoking 
end of the wide cotton-grass wick 
into the oval pool of seal oil, so 
that the smoke faded away and 
the line of flame brightened. 
Such soapstone lamps only could 
be seen in use here in the Cul- 
tural Sanctuary. 

Another shot smashed through 

WHO IS HUMAN? 



the igloo. Eewaalik made no 
move to lie down with the two 
whitemen, Smiling, she turned 
her head away from the two 
whitemen hiding on the floor. 
“Bullets of this person’s hus- 
band have eyes.” 

Councilor LaRue laughed as 
politely as if he were at a ban- 
quet in Montreal. “Madam, this 
Peterluk, I’m sure he is a won- 
derful shot. I want to ask you — ” 
LaRue paused as a spitting 
sound, a fourth rifle bullet, 
passed through the snow- wall. 
Sharp snow particles had struck 
his face. He smiled. 

With the natural ability of the 
born politician, Councilor LaRue 
already spoke modern-Eskimo 
as well as most of the Cultural 
Sanctuary guards. LaRue was 
anti-Sanctuary. Dr. West had 
hoped to spend several weeks if 
necessary showing Councilor La- 
Rue the potential menace of the 
population explosion in the Sanc- 
tuary. Dr. West had hoped to 
convince LaRue that not all of 
these people were Eskimos, that 
few of them were Eskimos. 

“Tell your husband we surren- 
der,” LaRue murmured, brushing 
snow from his face. “That means 
don’t shoot any more. We — 
we whitemen will go away. “We 
will leave at once.” 

The flickering flame-line from 
the lamp reflected on her greasy 
face. She smiled. Her teeth were 



171 



worn to stumps. Dr. West knew 
she was 44 years old. 

“Tell him to stop shooting,” 
LaRue’s voice was repeating. 

“It is not a woman’s place to 
advise her husband.” Eewaalik 
bowed her head, and a fifth shot 
spat through the igloo. 

UTJow many bullets did 
-*• Peterluk take?” Dr. West 
hopefully asked her. “Only the 
bullets in his rifle?” 

“My husband has long eyes. 
When your airplane was smaller 
than a petrel-bird, already my 
husband had packed the sled. His 
big dogs became smaller than 
lemmings.” 

“But he made a circle and 
came back,” Dr. West said, look- 
ing hopefully around the jum- 
bled interior of the igloo. “Did 
he forget his box of bullets?” 
Snow sprayed inward, and a 
new little eye appeared in the 
wall of the igloo. “Number five,” 
muttered LaRue, his count al- 
ready understandably inaccur- 
ate. “He has sufficient bullets.” 
Eewaalik smiled to herself. 
‘ This person wished to travel 
with her husband. But he said 
this person too sick. He said, if 
Dr. West in the airplane, this 
person should bare arm.” 

“An injection for your fever — 
the needle?” 

“Eh-eh,” she laughed in agree- 
ment. “The iron needle.” 



“I will give the injection. I will 
make the sickness go away — if 
you will go outside and wave to 
him to stop Shooting.” 

Eewaalik bowed her head, 
she was too courteous to dis- 
agree but — 

Dr. West wondered what had 
happened to the pilot they’d left 
tying down the ski-plane. No 
matter which way the gale was 
blowing, the Englishman should 
be able to hear the shots. Their 
three rifles were in the plane. 

“Number six,” sighed LaRue, 
as snow sprayed down on Dr. 
West’s face. “Madam, please go 
outside and ask your husband to 
stop the shooting. Tell him we 
only wanted to question him, 
we only wanted to ask him where 
all these new people are coming 
from.” 

They glanced at the Esk. 

The Esk smiled as if he real- 
ized he had become the subject 
of the conversation. 

“My babies,” Eewaalik 
laughed. 

LaRue politely ignored this re- 
mark. “Now if you would go 
outside, Madam, and tell him — 
oh!” This bullet ripped across 
the caribou skin cover on the 
sleeping platform past LaRue’s 
face. 

“Mon dieu! You — ” Councilor 
LaRue’s hand closed around the 
Esk’s arm — “you go out and tell 
him to stop shooting.”

/^'vbediently, the Esk crawled 
^ out through the tunnel to 
the little entry dome where their 
outer parkas were hung, and they 
could hear him struggling into 
his stiff parka. 

“He’s much shorter than we 
are. Peterluk will notice this 
man’s a fellow Eskimo,” the 
Councilor muttered. “After all, 
they know each other.” 

Dully, they heard the ninth 
shot. No hole appeared in the 
igloo. Dr. West scrambled along 
the snow tunnel to the entry and 
blinked at the dark object on 
the snow-glare. He thrust his 
head forward, then retracted it 
as a bullet kicked up snow. 

Whirling inside the entry 
dome, he seized a coiled line with 
a massive bone-splint tied to a 
stone. It was for snagging the 
floating body of a seal. 

As Dr. West yanked the body 
of the Esk toward the entry, the 
body shuddered, and the tenth 
shot echoed against Dr. West’s 
eardrums. Dr. West sank to his 
stomach. 

The eleventh shot splattered 
through the entry wall, leaving a 
pair of holes slightly higher than 
his shoulders. He winced. Eleven 
shots meant Peterluk had more 
than a clip of ammunition, pos- 
sibly a cardboard box of 20, prob- 
ably several boxes; damn, more 
likely a whole wooden case of 
bullets! 



Prone, from his low angle Dr. 
West noticed with swelling anger 
that one of the shots had tom off 
the top of the Esk’s skull. The 
line falling from his hands, Dr. 
West scurried backward along 
the tunnel into the foxhole cen- 
ter of the igloo. “Peterluk killed 
him.” 

The Councilor sprang to his 
feet, grabbed Eewaalik by the 
shoulder, pulled her down on to 
the floor. “Why? Why is your 
husband killing us?” 

“He did not tell this person.” 
“Is he afraid to tell us where 
the Esks came from?” Dr. West 
asked. “Is that why he kept run- 
ning away?” 

“This person — ” Eewaalik 
firmly removed herself from La- 
Rue’s grip and climbed back up 
on the sleeping platform as bul- 
let number twelve spattered wet 
snow across the igloo. Compul- 
sively she trimmed the seal oil 
lamp. “This person’s husband has 
said he does not like so many- 
many people. Too many people 
spoil the hunting.” 

“But we do not come to shoot 
seals,” Councilor LaRue pro- 
tested, and he squirmed on the 
icy floor, suddenly directing his 
anger to Dr. West. “You — if I — 
if my Uncle had not listened to 
you, I would be in my warm of- 
fice. My secretary would be 
bringing me hot coffee et crois- 
sants. Instead I am being fired

upon, frozen, murdered by sav- 
age — by voters. I do not think 
all the maniacs are out there. I 
think the maniac is you!” 

II 

/Councilor LaRue’s uncle was 
Etienne LaRue, grand old 
man of Canadian politics, whose 
political leadership sprang from 
the days when French Separat- 
ists put bombs in mail boxes. 
Solidified by his 84 years, Etien- 
ne LaRue’s hatreds were the 
Conservative Party, the English 
language and the Eskimo Cul- 
tural Sanctuaries which prevent- 
ed Quebec’s exploitation of the 
Far North. 

Old Etienne LaRue’s saurian 
hatred of the Cultural Sanctuar- 
ies was the reason Dr. West had 
turned to him — after Dr. West’s 
warning report had been ignored 
by the Cultural Sanctuary Com- 
missioners. 

When Dr. West had told of 
the frightening significance of 
the population increase in the 
Cultural Sanctuaries, the Com- 
missioners had been more im- 
pressed by his description of the 
hunger, the increasing scarcity 
of warm clothes. To Dr. West’s 
dismay the Commissioners voted 
to temporarily resume the old 
Family Allowances and ordered 
one relief plane to airdrop pack- 
ages and baby clothes. 



One Commissioner twisted an 
evasion into a boast. “While a 
temporary ecological imbalance 
may have appeared on the 
Boothia Peninsula, basically this 
shows the value of the Cultural 
Sanctuaries. It proves that our 
pioneering Far North Eskimos, 
freed from servile dependence on 
industrial civilization, not only 
can survive, but can increase.” 
“But the way they are increas- 
ing is not — human,” Dr. West 
exclaimed. “Even the mutation 
explanation is insufficient.” Dr. 
West then had made the mistake 
of boring busy men with detailed 
observations. When he attempted 
to hypothesize internal differ- 
ences between Eskimos and Esks 
and to retell the Esk’s own views 
as to their origin, he was met by 
raised eyebrows and growing sus- 
picion of his sanity. 

“Dr. West, your so-called 
evidence seems to be Eskimo 
myths and your — intuition.” 

“Yes, I admit there is insuf- 
ficient medical evidence as yet. 
That is why we need a study 
team; an autopsy, dissections 
must be carried out at once.” 
“Dr. West, would you have us 
arrest a Boothia Eskimo so you 
could cheerfully vivisect him like 
a dog,” a Commissioner laughed 
unpleasantly, “because you think 
he is not human?” 

“No!” Df. West now found 
himself accused of being a racist. 



174 



GALAXY 



“Eskimos are just as human as 
I am,” another Commissioner ex- 
claimed in righteous anger. 

“But I’m not talking about 
Eskimos,” Dr. West had shouted. 
“Can’t you understand, I’m talk- 
ing about Esks. Esks and Eski- 
mos are not the same.” 

“Anyone who breeds faster is 
sub-human, is that what you’re 
saying? I move we waste no more 
time with this man,” the Com- 
missioner continued. “Gentle- 
men, a little sidelight on Dr. 
West’s veracity — his sanity. You 
know of Dr. West’s limp, his leg 
injury, his six-month’s hospital- 
ization, which he flamboyantly 
attributes to an attack by a 
Polar Bear. But our Sanctuary 
guard reports the Eskimos con- 
fided to him that Dr. West ac- 
tually was bitten by a sled dog. 
I move we adjourn.” 

S eething with frustration. Dr. 

West had taken the plane to 
Montreal. Dr. West had hobbled 
into the office of Etienne LaRue, 
the powerful politician, so old 
he was now a statesman, who 
hated the Whole Cultural Sanc- 
tuary concept and listened with 
open lips. 

To Dr. West’s surprise, the old 
man was even more willing to 
conclude that the Esks were not 
human than was Dr. West. 

“ Voila , now we get rid of them! 
Those wild Eskimos are no better 



than dogs, their morals — Dogs- 
in-the-manger is what they are.” 
The old man clutched Dr. West’s 
arm. “All that land up there 
locked in Eskimo Sanctuaries — ” 
Dr. West knew the French- 
speaking population of Canada 
had been increasing rapidly. 

“They are not human, those 
Eskimos,” the old man repeated. 
“Look at their faces, like grin- 
ning devils, I dream of them. 
Slant- eyed devils! I wake my- 
self up. They are evil spirits!” 
Whether the old man was 
superstitious, racially prejudiced, 
a senile paranoid, or all three, 
Dr. West was willing to accept 
any assistance which might help 
stem the population explosion in 
the North. Theoretically, its 
consequences might cover the 
World. 

The old man smiled: “My 
nephew will head the investiga- 
tion.” 

Now the portly nephew of 
Etienne LaRue was squirming 
on the icy floor of the igloo. 

u M on dieu, that is the tenth 
J-fl. shot,” Councilor LaRue 
laughed' unhappily. “That savage 
has enough ammunition to drive 
both the English and French 
from Canada! I am cold and I 
do not want to die. Listen, I 
think we should break through 
the opposite wall of the igloo 
and run for it.” 



WHO IS HUMAN? 



175 



“To where?” Dr. West de- 
manded, 

“To the plane. Don’t be cow- 
ardly. Eskimos are all poor 
Shots.” 

“The pilot has tied the plane 
down,” Dr. West retorted. “You 
heard him shout the wind was 
too strong to take off or do any- 
thing. Listen, it’s blowing a gale 
right now. Running all the way 
down there would only attract 
Peterluk’s fire. He would shoot 
into the plane.” 

“Too much logic. We go! A 
brave pilot will taxi and take 
off into the hurricane itself if 
the bullets are chasing him.” La- 
Rue paused. “Where is that 
fool? He said he’d come up here 
to the igloo.” 

“He’s damn cold if he’s still 
inside the plane. I hope he’s still 
alive. I hope Peterluk hasn’t al- 
ready been down to the plane.” 

“My friend,” Councilor LaRue 
blurted, unexpectedly flopping 
his arm around Dr. West’s shoul- 
ders, “so do 1. So do I. This igloo 
is as cold as a crypt. Poof. That 
was bullet number eleven. See, 
it passed completely through the 
snow bench. He is firing lower. 
I do not care; I no longer wish 
this Eskimo’s vote,” LaRue 
laughed nervously. 

On the sleeping platform, 
Eevvaalik coughed and spat 
blood. 

“Doctor, in your fanciful dis- 



tinction,” LaRue said, “is she an 
Eskimo or an Esk?” 

“She is an Eskimo. Of these 
people, only Eevvaalik has had 
T.B., the only one. Esks do not 
appear to be subject to tubercu- 
losis. They don’t even have lice! 
Bacteria and parastic organisms 
may not have had time to ad- 
just to differences between Eski- 
mos and Esk metabolisms.” 

“Fine words and a theory of 
which you admit you have no 
proof. Did you not tell my uncle 
that Esks appear like swallows 
from the mud? Something like 
that. You have confused the old 
man — and me. I saw all of those 
people back in the camp where 
you picked up the guide, rest his 
soul, and they were the cleanest, 
the most helpful Eskimos I have 
seen in my many trips to the 
North. Certainly, they are hu- 
man! Are you insane? Everyone 
in my family knows my uncle is 
insane. I wish I were in my warm 
office.” 

“I wish it were true,” Dr. West 
muttered as bullet number 14 
zipped through the igloo from a 
new angle. 

46 A nyway, I don’t need you to 
tell me Eevvaalik is an 
Eskimo,” LaRue said. “It was 
you who showed me the old cen- 
list, when the government still 
had the compassion to give the 
Family Allowance and let the 



176 



GALAXY 



Far North Eskimos buy modern 
tools. Her fingerprints. Her chest 
x-rays. This Eewaalik and 
Peterluk, they were numbered 
children of those families who 
fled to the Boothia Pennin- 
sula — ” 

“Yes, and where are their fam- 
ilies now?” Dr. West answered. 
“Nearly forty Eskimo adults and 
children who were on the old 
Family Allowance census rolls 
have vanished. Only these two — ” 
LaRue looked up at Eewaalik. 
He smiled winningly. “Eewaalik, 
where are your father and moth- 
er, your sisters and brothers?” 
“All dead. Burned.” 

“Burned?” LaRue turned to 
Dr. West. “Don’t tell me she also 
is referring to the legend of the 
Burned Place we flew over.” 
“Yes. The blackened circle in 
the granite rock, the Burned 
Place.” Dr. West laughed wryly. 
“If you believe the bright newly 
created legends, it is where the 
Grandfather of the Esks ap- 
peared and burned those who 
disobeyed him.” 

Shaking his head, LaRue 
smiled up at Eewaalik. “I think 
you are much wiser than Peter- 
luk. You understand more than 
your husband who runs away. I 
will open a little hole for you in 
the side of the igloo. Then you 
can shout to your husband, ‘Do 
not shoot. These whitemen are 
friends.’ ” 



Eewaalik smiled back. “A 
good husband does not listen to 
his wife when there are others 
nearby to hear them.” 

“Then go out to him! Tell 
him to stop shooting.” 

“This person would obey and 
be shot — if she was one of her 
stupid children from the big 
camp.” Eewaalik wiped her 
mouth with the back of her hand. 
“But she is not. She is Eewaa- 
lik!” 

“And Peterluk also is differ- 
ent,” Dr. West added question- 
ingly, hoping somehow she could 
lead LaRue to realize that Es- 
kimos are not Esks. 

“Eh-eh, my husband also is 
braver than those meek children 
in the camps. Our bellies are 
hungrier. We do not like to be 
told what to do. My husband 
needs big room to hunt.” 

This boasting would convince 
no one there was a difference. 

Dr. West persisted, “why won’t 
Peterluk tell us if these people’s 
night stories are true? Why 
won’t he tell us where they come 
from?” 

“Eh-eh,” Eewaalik laughed. 
“Why do you men always want 
to ask my husband? This is a 
woman’s question, where babies 
come from.” 

“All these people were not 
bom here?” Dr. West asked as 
another leading question. 

“I am the mother!” 



WHO IS HUMAN? 



177 



Ill 

E ven Dr. West stared up at her 
in disbelief, as she laughed. 
“I am grandmother, the great- 
grandmother; I am barren now, 
but they began from me.” 
“Then the legend of the man 
who fell from the sky, whose 
back split open so that he bore a 
son, that is false?” 

“Who can say what is false? 
Peterluk was only a boy-man 
then, and how could he recog- 
nize his Grandfather?” The 
woman shook her head with dis- 
taste. “No, it would have been 
better if a bear was his Grand- 
father. His Grandfather! I was 
but a young girl who had borne 
only one child. Peterluk, how 
obediently he hunted meat to 
feed his Grandfather! Like dog, 
Peterluk dragged the sky iron 
from his Grandfather. His 
Grandfather-creature was so big 
we were afraid to run away.” 
“Then his Grandfather was not 
a man,” Dr. West persisted, fi- 
nally thinking this might lead to 
some evidence of extra-terrestrial 
origin. 

“My husband saw a man. If he 
had wanted to see a bear, the 
thing would have looked like a 
bear. What did I see? One night 
Peterluk loaned me to his Grand- 
father. I lay on the skins looking 
up as his Grandfather moved to- 
ward me. I tried to see a man.” 

178 



Then Eevvaalik laughed in de- 
rision. “No man. He took out 
something. It was not part of 
him. It was made of — glass. It 
looked like — like when you gave 
me the injection but much big- 
ger. Oh, so bad! I was a young 
girl and very frightened.” 

“Artificial insemination!” Dr. 
West exclaimed. 

“Disgusting,” Councilor La 
Rue protested. “Was that fiend a 
scientist? What is going on up 
here in the North?” LaRue rose 
toward Eevvaalik. “I do not ap- 
prove of any tampering with the 
human body. What evil did this 
man do to you?” 

“Eh? I was a surprised girl 
when I became sick in the stom- 
ach only two days later and 
swelled up and had my baby in 
a month!” 

Eevvaalik grinned and ges- 
tured crudely. “That glass tube! 
That one, that Grandfather, eh- 
eh, after that he kept after me. 
I was no more use to Peterluk, 
always I was heavy with babies. 
I was too tired to haul the sled, 
or gather driftwood, or chew 
skins. As a wife for Peterluk I 
was being ruined. Too many chil- 
dren were crying for food. In a 
year I bore more children than 
I have fingers! Peterluk was only 
a boy-man then and slow to 
anger in those days, but one 
night — ” 

She stopped as if the memory 
GALAXY 



frightened her. “It is better to 
believe all these people began 
when his Grandfather’s back was 
split open.” 

Dr. West noticed where she 
was looking. Across the igloo at 
a stone axe. 

“That Eskimo, he has stopped 
shooting,” LaRue ventured. 
“Perhaps Peterluk is going away. 
West, why don’t you carefully 
look out.” 

T 'here was a deafening, rever- 
berating rifle shot from the 
entry. The two men leaped up 
on opposite sleeping platforms 
on either side of the tunnel entry. 
Dr. West grabbed the stone axe. 
“If he comes in, we both jump 
him.” 

Somehow the bullet had passed 
the length of the tunnel and 
across the floor where they had 
been crouching without striking 
either man. 

“My husband,” Eewaalik 
called. “We have two visitors. 
One is waiting on each side above 
the door hole.” 

Peterluk’s hoarse voice entered 
the tunnel. “Tell the whitemen to 
come outside.” 

Dr. West shook his head at 
Eewaalik. 

“They are afraid you will kill 
them,” she called, and carefully 
began trimming the lamp. 

After a while Peterluk shout- 
ed, “Tell them to come out or 



I will break a hole in the side of 
the igloo and shoot them where 
they are lying.” 

Neither whiteman spoke. Dr. 
West clutched the stone axe, hop- 
ing Peterluk would do just that — 
chop his way into the igloo. Then 
Peterluk would have to set his 
rifle down — or hold it with one 
hand and give Dr. West an in- 
stant to counter-attack. 

Finally, Eewaalik called, 
“My husband, you had better do 
it, or go away and not do it.” 
“Woman, close your mouth!” 
Peterluk sounded as if he had 
put his head into the tunnel. 

The three people in the igloo 
sat there waiting. Dr. West im- 
agined he could hear Peterluk’s 
hoarse breathing. 

“Children who grow big as a 
man in five winters are very 
good,” Eewaalik said finally. 
“But too many. Children have 
children so quick, too many. 
Never enough seals. When this 
person was a little girl, my 
mother told me it was a hungry 
winter and I was born, and she 
would have left me out on the 
ice but changed her mind be- 
cause meat was found. Eh-eh, 
customs were wiser in those days, 
less hunger, enough new babies 
were left on the ice. Better not 
too many girls to feed. We need 
more hunters and less hungry 
babies.” 

Neither man commented. 



WHO IS HUMAN? 



179 



/ 




C C'\7'ou better come out,” 
* Peterluk’s voice called. 
“You better hurry. Many people 
coming, and they will kill you. 
You better come out and run 
away.” 

Neither man moved. Simple- 
minded liar, Dr. West thought, 
picturing Peterluk’s wide-cheeked 
visage. No people. 

“Those many people from the 
big camps wouldn’t kill any- 
body,” Eewaalik snorted. “They 



want everyone to like them, but 
there are too many of them.” 
“Come out.” Peterluk called, 
“The people are coming closer. 
Soon it will be too late.” 

Neither man moved or reacted 
to this painfully obvious trap. 

“All these people talk about is 
their Grandfather Bear from the 
sky,” Eewaalik said, and added 
with outrage, “They are not 
Christians!” 

A shot resounded outside the 



180 



GALAXY 




tunnel entrance, but there was no 
sign the bullet passed through 
the igloo. 

“All they talk about,” Eewaa- 
lik sneered, “is — soon so many 
of them that their Grandfather 
will come down from the sky. 
This person thinks he will merely 
eat them. That is what should be 
expected, if he is a bear. These 
people are not Christians.” 

There were three shots in 
quick succession. 



“He must be firing in another 
direction,” LaRue hissed. “Toss 
me the axe.” 

LaRue rose on his knees on the 
sleeping platform. With the 
handle of the axe he began 
knocking a hole in the roof of 
the igloo above his head, high 
enough up so that Peterluk 
would have to scramble up on the 
side of the igloo if he were to 
shoot in at them. 

Two more shots were fired. 



181 



WHO IS HUMAN? 



Then a fusillade of shots. Light 
bursting through the roof as snow 
chunks fell inside. 

Standing up on the sleeping 
platform, LaRue thrust his head 
up through the hole in the igloo. 

“Mon dieu\” like a turtle La- 
Rue ducked his head back inside 
as more shots reverberated. 

“ Mon dieu, hundreds of Es- 
kimos. He is shooting them.” 

Again LaRue poked up his 
head through the hole. “They 
are coming to rescue us I think. 
Ah, so many of them coming, 
like lemmings. He is shooting 
them, but they know no fear.” 

Now, between the shots, Dr. 
West could hear them calling to 
each other. 

“They have him! They have 
seized him. They have taken 
away his rifle.” LaRue pulled 
down his head into the igloo. 
“They have rescued us I hope. 
There are so many of them, we 
might as well go outside in any 
case and congratulate them.” 

IV 

TTCThen Dr. West scrambled 
’ ’ out of the tunnel into the 
blinding snowlight, he recognized 
Peterluk - standing among the 
Esks. None were holding him. 

Peterluk stared at the two 
whitemen from the igloo, whirled 
and began to run. 

“Stop him,” Dr. West shouted. 



A few Esks reached out half- 
heartedly. Peterluk brushed past 
them. They didn’t try to stop 
him. He was escaping. He was 
running wildly in a direction 
midway between plane and ridge. 

Dr. West hobbled after him, 
staggered, his leg cramping, and 
looked back for help. LaRue was 
standing among the Esks shaking 
their hands. LaRue obviously 
wasn’t going to run after Peter- 
luk, and Dr. West definitely did 
not want LaRue to shoot Peter- 
luk, who still might explain the 
origin of the Esks. 

Already gasping for breath, 
Dr. West changed his course to 
the direction from which the orig- 
inal bullets had entered the 
igloo. Since Peterluk’s sled and 
dogs were not visible he thought 
they might be concealed behind 
the ridge. It was probable Peter- 
luk had fired the first shots from 
up there. 

Dr. West’s left thigh muscles 
jerked like a poorly constructed 
android’s. It was true that he had 
been bitten by a polar bear, not 
a dog, and his thigh contained a 
great white square of plastic 
surgery. As he limped through 
the wind, his patched muscles 
warmed and gained rhythm. He 
scrambled up the snow-covered 
ridge. 

The dogs growled at him. 
Closer than the dogs was spread 
a worn caribou skin on which 



182 



GALAXY 



Peterluk must have lain. Fired 
cartridges gleamed. 

Dr. West cursed, wondering if 
the three rifles were still in the 
plane. “Damn!” Everything he 
did seemed to draw him deeper 
into a trap. Undoubtedly Peter- 
luk had shot the pilot. Now 
j* Peterluk probably had turned 
off, ran to the plane to get an- 
other rifle. 

■peering back over the ridge, 
Dr. West could see the plane 
but no Peterluk. What did this 
mean? If Peterluk had sniped 
the pilot from a distance, if 
Peterluk had not entered the 
plane, then he might not realize 
the rifles were in the plane. 
Peterluk probably believed they 
had rifles. The reason Peterluk 
had not broken into the igloo and 
shot them down like mice in a 
nest, Peterluk probably drought 
whitemen would have enough 
sense to have their rifles with 
them. Now Peterluk must be 
running for cover, circling back 
' toward his sled. 

Dr. West ran to the sled with 
virtually no limp, seized the 
w whip, beat back one snarling dog 
with the handle, then freed the 
sled. With the long whiplash, he 
snapped the lazier dogs to their 
feet and was driving the sled for- 
ward. He had the dogs in good 
control when Peterluk appeared 
along the back-side of the ridge. 



Peterluk ran away from the 
pursuing sled until he was ex- 
hausted, falling. He lay face- 
down on the snow. The dogs 
sniffed him, as Dr. West rammed 
his knee on Peterluk’s back and 
tied his hands behind his waist. 
There was no resistance. He tied 
Peterluk’s feet as Peterluk lay 
breathing hoarsely. 

“Why did you shoot at us?” 

“Too many,” Peterluk gasped, 
“too many.” 

When the sled carrying Peter- 
luk reached the igloo, Dr. West 
smiled prematurely at LaRue. 
“Listen to this. Peterluk, tell 
him.” 

“Not real people. Not real 
Eskimos. So it was not bad to 
kill them.” 

“It is bad!” LaRue exploded. 
“Killing is the worst sin. Why 
were you trying to kill us, the 
pilot, a whiteman?” 

“This person dreamed the air- 
plane held the Man-Who-Was- 
Bitten-by-a-Dog.” Peterluk in- 
dicated Dr. West by pointing 
with his stubby nose. “This per- 
son also dreamed guards with 
him!” 

“No guards. Peterluk is afraid 
of Cultural Sanctuary Guards 
because they have police func- 
tions and because — ” Dr. West 
stared down at the bound Es- 
kimo — “last winter on the ice he 
shot three Esks.” 

“On the ice not enough seals,”

Peterluk explained. “A few win- 
ters ago many seals but now 
Peterluk is starving. So many 
people this person can’t even find 
one old breathing hole in the ice; 
there are so few seals left. Too 
many people.” 

“You murderous savage,” La- 
Rue said. “You can’t simply 
point your rifle like God with a 
thunderbolt and reduce the num- 
ber of people.” 

“Eh-eh?” Peterluk laughed, 
confused. “Three young men 
from the big camp, on ice they 
killed a seal. This person’s belly 
told him to take the seal. Eh-eh, 
anyway their families not miss 
them, there are so many. They 
look like us but they are not 
Innuit, not Eskimos.” 

t£T)eterluk, tell what you saw 

•*- fall from the sky,” Dr. 
West insisted, but LaRue, squat- 
ting down, grabbed Peterluk by 
the front of his parka. 

“Savage, I have done you no 
wrong!” LaRue shouted, “Why 
did you shoot at me, a white- 
man?” 

“Nothing from sky. Too many 
people.” Peterluk muttered, de- 
fensively closing his eyes. 

“Yes', too many people,” Dr. 
West insisted to LaRue. “Listen, 
on the ridge Peterluk told me 
that he started to drive his sled 
away, to escape from the white- 
men. He thought we would ar- 



rest him because he’d killed 
three Esks. Then he had a better 
idea,” Dr. West said with irony, 
staring at the Esks all around 
them. “There was an Esk camp 
to the south, so he would shoot 
the whitemen, and the police 
would think the Esks had done 
it, and the police would take 
away the Esks.” 

“Too many,” Peterluk repeat- 
ed. 

“You see,” said Dr. West to 
LaRue. “You have seen the big 
camp. From the plane you have 
seen other camps dotting the 
coast. There are too many.” 

“Too many?” LaRue explod- 
ed. “Eight of them lying dead 
because they tried to save us, be- 
cause they walked forward 
empty-handed like heroes and 
took away this maniac’s gun! 
Too many? There are not enough 
Eskimos! There should be more 
Eskimos. They saved our lives. 
These wonderful people saved 
our lives.” 

“But something must be 
done — ” 

“Are you one of those birth- 
control fiends?” LaRue said. 
“Who are you to decide who lives 
and v/ho is not to be born? These 
people saved my life, and I’ll tell 
my Uncle Etienne. These people 
need food. They need warm 
clothes. You see there aren’t 
enough skins to go around. Look 
at these poor people shivering in 



184 



GALAXY 



the snow, but they saved my 
life. Look at that man lying there 
wounded, but he’s smiling. Don’t 
tell me these Eskimos aren’t hu- 
man, they’re the most human 
people of all.” 

“But they’re not human!” Dr. 
West shouted, “That’s the terri- 
ble part, they’re not human.” 

“Who are you to say who is 
human?” LaRue roared. “These 
people act gooder than you. I’ll 
fly that plane! I’ll report to my 
uncle these people need to be 
freed. You call this a Cultural 
Sanctuary? I say it’s a starvation 
cage!” 

T aRue banged his fist into his 
palm. “It’s an extermina- 
tion cage. If those Cultural 
Sanctuary Commissioners are 
plotting birth control, we’ll put 
a stop to that. My uncle con- 



trols a lot of votes. Mon dieu, 
these people have votes! My un- 
cle will make sure these Eskimos 
have the opportunity to vote.” 
Stunned, Dr. West stared at 
the blinding snow. Bringing a 
politician to the Cultural Sanc- 
tuary had become a terrible mis- 
take. 

The crying of a new baby 
pierced Dr. West’s conscience. 
Even here on the snow another 
Esk woman had given her month- 
ly birth. 

The world’s glacier-huge popu- 
lation problem would become a 
tidal wave. 

His face blank, Dr. West knew 
the Esks were increasing so fast 
they could in one life-time sub- 
merge the human population of 
the world. Dr. West in his utter 
frustration felt like crying too.

npen years have passed, and we 
are at a milestone. Delacorte 
Press, which incidentally is 
Dell’s hardcover arm, has pub- 
lished Judith Merril’s 10th An- 
nual Edition THE YEAR’S 
BEST SF. 

No anthology claiming to be 
the “best” of anything can be 
wholly honest in its title. There 
has been no serious attempt to 
gloss this fact for a number of 
years, now, but it bears my re- 
peating it. This is Judith Merril’s 
choice from an expanding variety 
of sources, as tempered by the 
circumstance of rights and per- 
missions, the wishes of her edi- 
tors and whatever policy judg- 
ment Delacorte has made in re- 
gard to science fiction. These are 



things it would be well to keep 
in mind in going through the 
book, for the most marked fea- 
ture of all in this volume is the 
one that has been showing up for 
many years but never so strong- 
ly — that is, Miss Merril’s ten- 
dency to make the contents ex- 
plain something about the cur- 
rent development of the field. 
(She calls it the emergence of a 
pattern). 

There are approximately 34 
items here. The ones written in 
such a way that one might im- 
mediately expect them to be 
pieces of entertainment are : “Au- 
tomatic Tiger” by Kit Reed, 
Richard Wilson’s “The Carson 
Effect,” “The Shining Ones” by 
Arthur C. Clarke, “Pacifist” by 



186 



Mack Reynolds, “Sonny” by 
Rick Raphael, “The Pirokin Ef- 
fect” by Larry Eisenberg, “The 
Twcrlik” by Jack Sharkey, 
“Problem Child” by Arthur Por- 
ges, Morgan Kent’s “Family Por- 
trait,.” “A Miracle Too Many” 
by Philip H. Smith and Alan E. 
Nourse, “The Last Lonely Man” 
by John Brunner, and Robert 
Rohrer’s “The Man who Found 
Proteus.” 

There are varying degrees of 
quality — none of them stun- 
ningly high, though I am rather 
fond of “The Carson Effect,” 
“The Pirokin Effect,” “A Mir- 
acle Too Many,” and “The Last 
Lonely Man.” The first of these 
is about human behavior the day 
before the world is due to end: 
the second is an ethnic joke about 
signals from Mars and chopped 
liver, and the third is about a 
doctor who really can heal the 
sick. Only the fourth, by the 
way, contains what T take to be 
a genuine honest-to-God science- 
fiction idea of novelty and merit. 
Brunner has thought of a new 
way to confer a sort of immor- 
tality, by personality-transfer- 
ence. He has worked out the 
social consequences of something 
which just may in fact be pos- 
sible, and though he fails to do 
much more than the obvious 
once he has brought it to that 
point, he has nevertheless gotten 
it to the point of logical develop- 



ment, which is more than can be 
said, really, for most of the other 
stories named above. It seems to 
have been a year in which even 
the authors who work in a fairly 
straightforward manner were 
content to exercise varying de- 
grees of charm and talent in 
dressing up the first two-thirds 
of their stories — or what would 
have been considered only the 
first two-thirds of their stories a 
few years ago. 

The book also includes such 
pieces as “The New Encyclopae- 
dist” by Stephen Becker, “Gas 
Mask” by James D. Houston, 
“A Sinister Metamorphosis” by 
Russell Baker, “Descending ” by 
Thomas M. Disch, “Be of Good 
Cheer” by Fritz Leiber, James 
T. Farrell’s “A Benefactor of Hu- 
manity,” “Synchromocracy” by 
Hap Cawood, and a poem called 
“The Search” by Bruce Simonds, 
all of which are not so much 
stories at all as they are tracts, 
usually illustrations of the well- 
known fact that the machines 
are taking over and that many 
people have failed to fit them- 
selves for living with anything 
more complicated than a strike- 
anywhere match. Although some, 
such as “Be of Good Cheer,” are 
written ingratiatingly, and others 
such as “Synchromocracy” and 
“The New Encyclopaedist” are 
extremely good fun, not one is 
anywhere near as much a source

of entertainment and pleasure as 
it is an assertion of the author’s 
view of the world, whether you 
like it or not. This is the group 
of stories among which Bob Dy- 
lan would find the ones he liked, 
if he had time. 

More or less, finally, we have 
some stories which, whether I 
like them or not, hit me hard as 
sheer pieces of systematic and 
powerful imagination. These are 
“The Legend of Joe Lee” by 
John D. MacDonald, “The Last 
Secret Weapon of the Third 
Reich” by Josef Nesvadba, “De- 
cadence” by Romain Gary, “It 
Could be You” by Frank Rob- 
erts, Roger Zelazny’s “A Rose 
For Ecclesiastes,” “The Termi- 
nal Beach” by J. G. Ballard, 
“The Wonderful Dog Suit” by 
Donald Hall, “The Mathenauts” 
by Norman Kagan, “The Red 
Egg” by Jose Maria Gironella, 
“The Power of Positive Think- 
ing” by M. E. White, Robert 
Wallace’s “A Living Doll,” 
“Training Talk” by David R. 
Bunch, and finally “Yachid and 
Yechida” by Isaac Bashevis 
Singer. I don’t know whether all 
of these are stories or not, but 
they are written by people who 
seem qualified to say whatever 
it is that they have chosen to say. 

John D. MacDonald can write 
his way out of any paper bag 
you care to construct, and his 
story of the two kids in their 



hotrod is in some ways the story 
of one kind of kid anywhere, 
and if set in lyrics — well, as a 
matter of fact, MacDonald does 
provide lyrics for the Top 40 
transcription. “Decadence” is 
transformed from a routine story 
about a gangster who gets cul- 
ture by the fact that Gary is one 
of the few people — like the late 
Richard McKenna — who has 
lived a good chunk of hard- 
edged life before uttering judg- 
ment upon it; and while “A Rose 
For Ecclesiastes” is marvelously 
good only by the standards of 
people who think that words 
have an immediate and dramatic 
effect on society, this story of a 
genius human-poet communicat- 
ing with the dying Martian race 
is daring, often moving, and be- 
trays an acquaintance with the 
genuine strength of language, not 
as distinguished from but as con- 
gruent with its beauty. 

“The Terminal Beach” is an- 
other of J. G. Ballard’s evoca- 
tions of desolation and the organ- 
ic power of environment over 
both his protaganist and his 
reader. I will think a good deal 
more of Ballard after he has 
written just one complete story, 
with a beginning, middle and 
end — just to prove he can do it, 
you understand, before he goes 
back to wooing himself — but 
one cannot ignore a writer who 
can make you feel heat and 



188 



GALAXY 



thirst, and then make you dis- 
miss them as trifling compared 
to the real problem (whatever 
that may be). “The Wonderful 
Dog Suit” and “The Power of 
Positive Thinking” as well as “A 
Living Doll,” are pretty slight 
stuff, but they are short, and each 
of them makes its small point 
only once or twice before it stops, 
in which format these points are 
seen to be briefly interesting. 
“Training Talk” brings forth two 
children and a father straight out 
of Theodore Sturgeon, which is 
very good, though one wishes 
Sturgeon had also been studied 
before Bunch chose his ending. 

“The Mathenauts” may or may 
not be comprehensible. The glos- 
sary provided for us by Miss 
Merril and Delacorte is rather 
badly scrambled, but I suspect 
that if one knew the mathemati- 
cal terminology and the abstract 
concepts involved somewhat more 
thoroughly than one does know 
them, this would be both a funny 
and a science-fictional story. 
“The Last Secret Weapon of the 
Third Reich” is a very good piece 
of moralistic science fantasy in 
the tradition of Carel Capek, and 
“Yaehid and Yechida” is the 
kind of scholarly proposition put 
forward as either an intellectual 
tool or toy by scholars of the 
Torah. Of all the stories in this 
book it is the one that I felt 
actually had something uncom- 



mon to say, despite the fact that 
so many others in these pages 
clamor vigorously that they too, 
or if not they, then their authors, 
are important. 

A great many of the stories in 
this Tenth Annual Anthology are 
in the mode of the literary maga- 
zine, bursting with insights of the 
vigor possible only to those who 
have had time to think intensely 
and talk much among themselves, 
and with any luck will establish 
such reputations that they will 
never have to deal with the world 
at all. Miss Merril’s interdictory 
notes between selections assume 
such things as that the RNA 
hypothesis of transmitted learn- 
ing is proven, that it’s a shame 
what they’re doing to krebiozen 
and that the general run of writer 
could be a scientist or a real 
philosopher if he spent but five 
minutes a day increasing his 
wordpower. 

Most of all, however, as noted 
and implied, Miss Merril seems 
to think that the long-awaited 
merger of science fiction into the 
“mainstream” is being signalled 
by the appearance of so much, 
compilable material in the “liter- 
ary” magazines, as if fantasy and 
allegory had just now entered 
that mode. And the touchstone of 
quality — the criterion for the 
“best” when she now discovers 
an example in one of the more 
prosaic sources from which she 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



m 



drew her first collections — now 
seems to be the degree to which 
the candidate work resembles this 
umbilicentric standard. 

Though we have a milestone 
here, I think it marks a place 
more on Miss Merril’s road, and 
less on science fiction’s. 

XTou would have thought there 
was no conceivable new 
switch on the “Universe” story. 
The slower-than-light interstellar 
spaceship, pursuing its way 
through the weary centuries, its 
crew losing touch with all reality 
save the interior of their vessel . 
Well, you know the story, and 
its unhappy downhill round, its 
exciting struggles between the 
barbarian tribes which develop 
in its disparate compartments, 
and then, if the writer is so mind- 
ed, the ultimate flash of hope as 
the good guys win out and pre- 
pare to meet their future on some 
noble, if erroneous basis. 

Many hands have worked at 
improving Heinlein’s impeccable 
statement of this theme. Not one 
of them till now has gotten any- 
where farther. But The Watch 
Below by James White (Ballan- 
tine) does it. It does it by intro- 
ducing another vessel into the 
story; and, as the story switches 
back and forth between the alien 
starship and the closed, mobile 
environment of the Terrestials 
who are equally embarked on an 



immense, imponderable journey, 
White uses the differences and 
the similarities between the two 
to tell a moving, genuinely opti- 
mistic story. 

Perhaps you have been won- 
dering what is meant by the term 
“storyteller” when it appears in 
this column. All right — a story- 
teller is someone with the gift of 
involving his audience closely in 
an adventure with a beginning, 
middle and clear-cut ending 
which logically and satisfactorily 
fulfills the promise of the pre- 
ceding parts. To be a storyteller, 
a writer must be able to not only 
pose a real-sounding problem in- 
volving people or things worth 
saving, he must also be able to 
either solve it or show that there 
is no solution for very good rea- 
sons. 

By the rules played in these 
pages, neatness counts. The 
writer is not allowed to bring in 
moral judgments, what “every- 
one knows” about the condition 
of the world or dogma of any 
sort. His characters may of course 
believe in these things, or they 
would not seem like people; but 
no individual who sets out to 
create a pocket universe is allow- 
ed the luxury of evading his re- 
sponsibilities behind a bunch of 
mere words, no matter how skill- 
fully spoken or how comforting 
their message. He is very definite- 
ly, as you can see, allowed to 



190 



GALAXY 



solve problems, and it is by this 
trait that he is most readily dis- 
tinguishable from some of his 
cousins in the Word game. 

White has been very neat in 
this book. His aliens are actual- 
ly part of a fleet of people and 
livestock fleeing from the de- 
struction of their solar system. 
Passengers and livestock may 
sleep in suspended animation un- 
til a suitable new world is found 
for this water-dwelling race, but 
the crew of the guide spaceship 
cannot. They discover to their 
horror very early in their journey 
that repeated suspensions and re- 
vivals produce mindlessness, and 
so they have no choice but to 
mate, beget and educate children 
and try to keep their purpose 
alive. The solar system toward 
which they are driving is, of 
course, ours. 

Meanwhile, on Earth during 
World War II, a tanker is torpe- 
doed and technically sunk. But 
because of its buoyant compart- 
ments, it sinks only a certain 
distance below the surface and 
then hangs precariously suspend- 
ed, drifting about the oceans of 
the world, written off and for- 
gotten. There are people trapped 
inside, and as the situation 
gradually comes home to them, 
they have no choice but to find 
ways of creating light, food, air 
and buoyancy, and to try to stay 
alive until they are rescued or 



some other unlikely event frees 
them. 

White gives them considerably 
less to work with that Defoe ever 
gave Robinson Crusoe. The 
tanker was running empty and 
is therefore buoyant (White 
justifies this). The tanker does 
contain some snacks of beans, 
welding equipment together with 
oxygen and acetylene tanks, and 
very few other odds and ends. In 
otherwords, he has posed a prob- 
lem just this side of impossibili- 
ty, and the solution worked out 
by the trapped handful of people 
therefore seems both legitimate 
and properly arduous. Like the 
aliens, the Terrestrials must 
breed and educate their children 
if anything worthwhile of them 
is to survive and return once 
more to the main line of its 
destiny. Like the aliens, the Ter- 
restrials have their dissidents, 
their impractical dreamers, their 
engineers both conservative and 
radical who are charged with 
maintaining their environment 
and attempting to modify it 
favorably; and in the end both 
aliens and terrestrials survive and 
take up the other end of the 
thread that broke many years 
earlier. 

But they cannot do it except 
with each other’s help. The 
aliens, landing in the oceans of 
Earth, create a great furor in 
the world. Only because they 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



191 



rescue the descendants of the 

original tanker-trapped Terres- 
trials are they able to find any- 
one who will understand their 
problem and interpret it to the 
rest of the world. You can say 
to yourself all you like that 
nothing good and decent ever 
happens in the world, and that 
we are all going to hell. But you 
cannot read this book and find 
any place where White has lied 
to you in demonstrating that this 
is not necessarily true. You will 
note that he does not say that it 
is easy. 

And, just incidentally, this is 
very nice writing when consider- 
ed simply as prose and as an at- 
tempt to involve the reader’s 
emotions. I had not up to now 
thought of White as a writer 
whose work was worth watching 
for, but we all live and learn. 

JHVan of the Lost Land, by Edi- 
son Marshall has long been 
thought of as a minor classic in 
the field. This short, over-con- 
densed novel of a lost Cro-Mag- 
non race in Antarctica has now 
been issued by Chilton, and some 
of you may be wondering if it is 
worth buying. I quote to you a 
paragraph from page 112: 

“(The Neanderthal) belonged 
to one of the lowest races of hu- 
man kind. Although his intelli- 
gence was far greater than the 
highest apes, he was still far be- 

192 



low such brutish people as the 

African bushman and the New 
Zealand Maori. As yet he had 
never felt the slightest urge to- 
ward beauty — he understood it 
not at all — consequently it had 
never been bred into his face. 
The process of sexual selection 
which, had he desired, would 
have refined his features and 
given him at least the smooth 
comeliness of an African sav- 
age ...” 

From there on, you must guide 
yourself. 

A lien Kim Lang is one of the 
writers who has contributed 
a great many good stories to the 
field without anyone’s taking 
particular notice of him. He has 
been working at it for a long 
time, but he has never piled up 
the frequency of appearance 
which builds fan clubs. The other 
thing it helps to do is to get a 
few books published, and this is 
now being done. Wild and Out- 
side (Chilton) is his first. 

Perhaps because he has been 
writing for such a long time 
(the jacket copy credits him with 
“some two hundred short stor- 
ies”) it reads more like the 
thirtieth minor effort of the man 
who long ago stopped feeling the 
need to prove that he was good. 
Flashes of the old compulsion to 
do more than required can still 
be seen in the work, but the in- 

GALAXY 



vention is flagging and the plot 
is a combination of known sure- 
fire elements put together by rule 
of thumb rather than by visceral 
instinct. The great days are be- 
hind the author, and he reports 
to his typewriter as to a time- 
clock rather than an assignation. 
But, you say, this is a first novel. 
You are quibbling, say I, but you 
do give me hope. 

Wild \ and Outside is a story 
about undercover baseball play- 
ing on an alien planet in order to 
bring about a technological revo- 
lution through the use of atomic 
power and sex. The hero is Eddie 
Keenan, otherwise, when surgical- 
ly disguised, known as Iddilcin- 
nin, the warrior Iron Wrists of 
the barbaric planet Melon. He is 
sent by Earth’s Maieutic Service 
to undermine the despotism of 
the Mysteriarch Mirandagor and 
bring technology and succor to 
Prince Ida of the East. Keenan, 
late of the world champion Mets, 
learns to fight with a stick, cope 
with the proto-feudal society in 
which he finds himself, and, 
journeying through such perils as 
the dread Limbo Marsh and 
fighting off the terrible Pipers, 
he and his team of Rinkydinks 
accomplish their purpose aided 
by My Lady-Eyes-of-Dawn and 
a variety of other people includ- 
ing Old Mule, the Wasp, et ce- 
tera. The mood switches from 
hilarity nearly to tragedy and 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



back again with a fine recollec- 
tion of L. Sprague DeCamp’s 
Viagens series, including a nubile 
Brazilian engineer, and the book 
is good but minor and fleeting 
fun. Not minor league. You can 
tell there is an old pro at work 
here — an old pro much too ex- 
perienced to feel that a first novel 
ought to be more ambitious. 

Maybe he doesn’t care whether 
anyone recognizes Allen Kim 
Lang’s name from one story to 
the next, as long as the stories 
remain enjoyable. What a truly 
alien thought! 

All right, Chilton, now the next 
step is to put together a short 
story collection by this man. You 
can call it Wild Modesty. 

D aniel Keyes’ Flowers For 
Algernon — which won a 
Hugo as a novelette, was a note- 
worthy television play and is now 
being made into a motion pic- 
ture — is being brought out as a 
novel by Harcourt, Brace 85 
World, Inc. It is very good. 

Keyes, a veteran of the New 
York public school teaching rat 
race and presently an English in- 
structor at Wayne State Univer- 
sity, former assistant editor of 
Marvel Science Fiction, peers out 
from his jacket photograph as 
if he expected you to make some 
absolutely flabbergasting propo- 
sition to him. The wary look is 
occasioned by his knowing ahead 

193 



oi time that whoever you are or 
whatever your intentions he will 
not be able to keep from doing 
his best for you at whatever cost. 
A gentle and observant man, 
Keyes has done much with the 
story of Charlie Gordon, the re- 
tarded adult who is brought to 
and beyond full intellectual 
maturity by an experimental 
operation before lapsing back in- 
to the stuporous but gentle world 
whence he came. 

On principle, I don’t believe 
a novelette can be made into a 
novel. But this exception is in- 
structive, because Charlie’s es- 
sentially simple story can be 
used to hold up a mirror to a 
great many features of society 
and of human nature without be- 
coming attenuated. This prob- 
ably means that it is a real story, 
a genuine piece of life freed from 
the stone, various, beautiful and 
not new but even rarer, honest. 

Meanwhile, Keyes shows us 
the social worker, the experimen- 
tal psychologist and the ordinary 
people concerned with Charlie 
and with Algernon, the mouse 
whose apparent favorable re- 
sponse to the same sort of ex- 
perimental procedure led to the 
experiment on Charlie. These are 
all shown as rounded figures. 
There is no one in this story who 
does not display both “good” 
and “bad” exactly as people do 
in getting from one end of this 

194 



world to the other. Charlie’s real 
problem does not become imme- 
diately apparent, nor is his uni- 
verse made smaller than the 
whole world, nor does he solve 
his problem. But neither is it 
better that he failed. He wins, 
and he loses. The world wins and 
loses with him. 

In order to be this kind of 
storyteller — one who at least 
by implication takes the whole 
world for the universe he pro- 
poses to create — you have got 
to know your field inside out, you 
have got to know a great deal 
about people and about the par- 
ticular human situation you pro- 
pose to describe, and you have 
got to have a great deal of func- 
tional faith in yourself. These 
are the qualities which normally 
contribute to the making of a 
writer all of us know is great. 
The only quality Keyes has not 
demonstrated is an ability to re- 
peat this sort of performance 
time and again, with more 
successes and stirring failures 
than dull disappointments. Keyes 
hasn’t published very much at 
all — he has published remark- 
ably little fiction, and there are 
no indications that he is going to 
publish very much in the future. 
If this is a beginning, then what 
a beginning it is, and if it is the 
high point in a very short career, 
then what a career.

Could you write 
for television? 

I $y Max Shulman 

p 

J. rankly, T don’t know. Blit this I do know: 
when I was running the Oobic Ciillis show, 

I often paid $2,500 and more for scripts 
turned out by people who should have been 
arrested for impersonating writers. 

Mow such people got to be high-priced 
TV writeis is not .is mysterious as it seems. 
Television is an insatiable maw into which 
m i i pis must be fed at a rate unprecedented 
in the history of entertainment. It is a grate- 
ful producci indeed who consistently gets 
scripts which have been written with real 
understanding of television’s powers and 
limitations. 

To help train new TV writers, I joined 
with Rod Serling (creator of The Twilight 
Zone, winner of five Emmy Awards) and 
ten other leading authors* to start the 
Famous Writers School. We pooled every- 
thing we had learned in our long years in the 
business to devise four professional writing 
courses that men and women, seriously in- 
terested in writing, could take in their own 
homes in their free time.
