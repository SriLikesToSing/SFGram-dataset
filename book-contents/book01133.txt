\ publication for wfiicfi we 
have much respect, and from 
which we derive much enjo 3 ?ment, 
is England’s New Scientist, which 
manages to compress in a single 
slim weekly issue nearly every- 
thing that is happening in nearly 
all of science. Like most of the 
people and institutions we most 
admire, though, the New Scien- 
tist, while brilliant and rock-hard 
reliable most of the time, has 
its loony moments. One happen- 
ed last Christmas. The occasion 
was the marvelous Apollo 8 cir- 
cumnavigation of the moon. Most 
of the world rejoiced and ap- 
plauded; New Scientist managed 
only to weep a few tears of shame 
that those childish Americans 
were spending all that money on 
spaceflight while billions here on 
Earth lacked proper food. 

What is most disturbing about 
this particular aberration is that 



it is by no means limited to New 
Scientist, nor to the world out- 
side the U.S.A. We hear plenty 
of it right here at home; and 
the last public-opinion survey re- 
leased in the newspapers shows 
that it is shared by a majority of 
American voters. At least, only 
some 38% are clearly in favor 
of the space program, while near- 
ly twice as many are either ac- 
tively opposed, or don’t much 
know about it or don’t much 
care. 

There’s not much point in go- 
ing into arguments once more. 
Surely there is much need for 
Doing Something about world 
htmger, about the cities, about 
racial problems, about peace. But 
will taking money from the space 
program help in any of these 
ways? Hardly. There’s no evidence 
at all that curtailing tire spacer 
program, even canceling it cnlirc-

ly, will contribute a nickel’s wortK 
of benefit to any of those causes. 
It might well do them Harm: 
certainly the skills and resources 
in the space program now can be 
more readily diverted to, say, the 
manufacture of more destructive 
armaments than to clearing up 
air pollution or urban crime. 

But there’s not much point, 
either, in merely deploring a state 
of mind. The anti-space people 
may be very wrong, but they are 
also very convinced. It would be 
desirable to find some way in 
which the space program can ac- 
tively help to solve human prob- 
lems right here and now. 

Is there such a possibility? 

It turns out there is; and it 
was suggested in the March is- 
sue of another estimable maga- 
zine, The Bulletin of the Atomic 
Scientists, by its editor, Eugene 
RabinowitcH. 

T he world is small, says Rabin- 
owntcH, and no one knows it 
better than the astronauts and 
the cosmonauts, who alone 
among us can see it from outside. 
It makes no sense to divide so 
tiny a particle into warring 
camps. There is only one human 
race; we might as well learn how 
to get along with one another. 

Some day, perhaps, we will 
find Somebody Else out there, 
and maybe then we will find 



ourselves united perforce against 
a common enemy. But whether 
that happens or not, surely we 
can conquer space better together 
than we can in competition. And 
what better time to start cooper- 
ating than now? 

Until now, the space programs 
of the U.S.A. and tlie Russians 
have been whoUy competitive. 
But, says RabinowitcH, 

Sooner or fater, the circle most be 
broken. Why not now? Why should 
we not offer the Soviet Union partkipo- 
tion In an Apollo mission. In exchange 
for United Stated participation In <a 
Soviet manned space flight? 

Why not indeed? 

Oh, to be sure, if one puts one’s 
mind to it, there are a few “why 
nots” to be found. The language 
barrier. The security barrier. The 
opposition of hard-liners on both 
sides. 

But those are problems that 
amount to nothing, compared to 
what is to be gained. No one is 
suggesting that anybody give 
anything away; it is a sugges- 
tion for a one-for-one trade; and 
all of human history suggests 
that trade benefits both sides. 

Good idea? We think so. We 
tliink it is worth the President’s 
attention. We think it is worth 
writing a few letters to congress- 
men about . right now.

by SYDNEY VAN SCYOC

By law, he was a Special Person 
but his birthright was divided 
between the sky and the crystal 
shards of his earthbound angers.

Tf was a bitter March noon when 
-^Kert TaKn shattered angry 
words at the feet of that arrogant 
man, tKe dispatcher at Sundley 
Transport. Kert’s blue crest 



flared. His eyes shot hawk-fire. 
Two months of anger jarred from 
Kis lips in fiery crystals and 
smashed to the pavement. 

When the last hot word lay 
sKarded, Kert thrust past the 
speechless dispatcher, past the

fully loaded hoverdish', squat and 
tonnish’, down the lift-ramp, into 
tKe street. 

Sunlight flickered weakly off 
the pavement, flashed palely at 
tHe copper and scarlet medallion 
at Kert Tahn’s neck. He was a 
lean and hungry Person, witH a 
stiff shock of blue feathers and 
the face of a circling hawk. But 
no one in the midday crowd gave 
him a second glance. 

Kert bounced off a hefty ma- 
tron who clutched parcels in six 
stout arms, jarred into her mate, 
whose blood foamed through 
heavy jugs strapped to his arms. 
He sideswiped a burly individu- 
al with wheeled metal legs. 

The burly man spun hard 
against a wall and wheeled 
around. “You want to match me, 
bird?” He squealed his tires Hot- 
ly- 

Kert clenched his teeth against 
a hard crystal of anger. "My 
trespass,” he muttered, touching 
his medallion. He dodged away. 

He pounded pavement under- 
foot for an hour, dispersing the 
bitter remnants of anger. Then, 
calmed, he raised his eyes. The 
walls of the city canyoned around 
him, suddenly confining. Far 
above, hovercraft wove a random 
pattern across a patch of pale 
sky. 

Kent’s chest tightened. TKe 
need to rise was suddenly desper- 
ate, the need to loft into the sky,

to renew his futile, angering 
seardi for something nameless, 
formless tKat beckoned there, far 
and high. He labored for breatU 
against crushing claustrophobic 
bands. 

Straining for breatH, he glared 
around. He located a callbootK 
and entered. He punched at the 
callboard, then raked harsh fin- 
gers through his stiffened crest. 

TKe copper and scarlet insignia 
of the Special Persons Bureau fill- 
ed the viewscreen. “Special Per- 
sons Bureau. Which desk, please?” 

“Jobs One.” 

A moment and Jobs One 
splashed upon the viewscreen, a 
butterscotch girl, pertly smiling. 
Then she recognized Kert Tahn. 
TKe smile melted down her face. 
“Mr. Tahn! You haven’t jobbed 
off again!” 

His voice was harsK. “I Have. 
An hour ago.” He beamed hawk- 
fire into the viewsender, trying 
to burn urgency into her butter- 
scotch heart. “I need another job. 
Now.” 

“But Mr. Tahn! Sundley 
Transport was your sixth job 
since last May. Six jobs in less 
than a year, Mr. Tahn. That’s — ” 

Kert’s crest flared. “Then get 
me one that fits this time.” 

Jobs One covered herself with 
an apologetic smile. “I’ll certainly 
do what I can.” She bent. Her 
fingers danced earnestly over the 
computer board.

Kelt slumped against the wall 
of tfie callbootU. His words show- 
ed as solids to fiis eyes, though 
others seemed never to see them 
Now they lay on the floor, slowly 
evaporating. He kicked aside the 
dissolving crystals. He ran a 
smoothing hand over his crest. 
Overhead, city traffic bobbed, 
beckoning. 

Eventually Jobs One raised a 
pleasant smile. “Mr. Tahn, I can 
place you right within the Spe- 
cial Persons Bureau. The compu- 
ter has matched you with a slot 
at Rural Welfare. It’s remote area 
work, daylight hours, with mini- 
mum radio work. It seems ideal, 
really. May I arrange an inter- 
view?” 

Kert’s chest loosened. He sigh- 
ed deeply. “Call me at home 
when it’s arranged.” 

Kert stepped from the booth. 
He stared up into the city sky. 
Maybe this time the job would 
be tolerable. Maybe this time the 
craft would be light and fleet. 
Maybe, together, they would rise, 
seek — find. 

Find what? Frowning, Kert 
averted his eyes from the sky. 

ert’s apartment was a small 
place that gleamed with met- 
al. 

When he keyed the door, the 
wallphone summoned. 

“You certainly took your time,” 
Jobs One said brightly. “I spoke

MAY will see us fairly launched on 
our fantasy program with the re- 
lease of Fletcher Pratt's parallel- 
world novel THE BLUE STAR (95c) 
— a remarkable extrapolation of 
a world in which witchcraft, rather 
than the sciences, is the repository 
of knowledge. There is an affec- 
tionate and discerning Introduction 
by Lin Carter, who is editing this 
series for us — and whose own 
book, TOLKIEN; A Look Behind 
"The Lord of the Rings," has al- 
ready won high praise from such 
trade media as Publishers' Weekly. 

(A friendly reminder to regular reviewers 
who will certainly not want to be unaware 
of such major reading trends and we 
are not being even remotely sardonic. 
Adult fantasy reading, headed by Tolkien, 
is o major reading trend If ever there 
was one. And Lin's book Is a boon as a 
guide to adult fantasy; besides being a 
lot of fun just for its own sake.) 

MAY sees also two original science- 
fiction works from the House that 
Brings You Nothing but the Best 
(for you who have been complain-

ing — this is, too, an ad,) Namely, 
DIMENSION THIRTEEN, in which 
Robert Silverberg provides thirteen 
variations with his usual precision 
and finesse. We claim he uses a 
scalpel rather than a typewriter. 
One of our favorite authors, even 
if he does want to be Pope. 

AND a new writer for us — 
Richard C. Meredith — with a taut, 
totally believable drama, just the 
kind of mess humankind is likely to 
get into if it ever reaches the stars, 
titled THE SKY IS FILLED WITH 
SHIPS. 

A reminder of other goodies you 
can get from us — the works of 
Anne McCaffrey, Edmund Cooper, 
E.R. Eddison, James White, Miriam 
Allen deFord, John Wyndham, Ar- 
thur C. Clarke, and any number 
more. For details, write to our 
splendid new warehouse. Dept. 
GCS, Ballantine Books, 36 West 
20th Street, New York 10003. That 
definitely is West 20th, by the 
way. We previously listed it (in 
the March issue) as 23rd. Couldn't

to Mr. Daimler at Rural Welfare. 
They’re ready to begin Spring 
Mission, and he’s three men short. 
You’re to sign papers of employ- 
ment tomorrow early at Bureau 
headquarters, mid-city. TKeri 
report to Mr. Daimler, Rural 
Welfare Division, city-perimeter, 
to begin work immediately.” Her 
smile was full of self-congratula- 
tion. “And please — don’t let me 
hear from you for at least a year.” 

Kert paced the apartment rest- 
lessly. Finally at dusk, he shafted 
to street level. He prowled, eyes 
constantly seeking the sky, where 
night-lit Hovercraft wove intri- 
cate patterns. 

Kert had come to the city out 
of the sky twenty-two years be- 
fore as an infant, orphaned. His 
parents had inhabited one of the 
rural settlements maintained by 
the special Persons Bureau for 
those of the genetically disadvan- 
taged, unable to adjust to urban 
life. 

His parents had lived and they 
had died, and beyond those sim- 
ple facts, Kert was ignorant of 
them. The Special Persons Bu- 
reau had hung its medallion at 
his neck, marking Him its own 
child, a variant on the human 
theme. The Bureau had fed and 
clothed him, Weltered and school- 
ed him. The Bureau had served 
him as mother, father, aunt and 
uncle. Now in His refractory 
adulthood, it brooded over him, 

GALAXY 



nagging, advising, moralizing. 

Kert prowled, nigHtiiawk in 
blue. His eyes flickered restlessly 
oyer His fellows, sorting tfiem: 
normal, apparently normal but 
medallioned, visibly variant. 

The variants He classed auto- 
matically into sub-groups. There 
were tfiose variants as to size, as 
to proportion, number and type 
of limbs, facial topograpHy, skin 
texture, complexion tone. There 
were even a few who boasted 
fledgling crops of featHers. 

Nowhere did he meet another 
with crest of blue and the face 
of a hawk. 

Had he expected to? 

Once he Had. Questing, he had 
even joined the Fraternal Order 
of Feathered Friends briefly. Birds 
of a feather did indeed flock to- 
gether. But flocking, fluttering 
and idly pecking had proven dis- 
appointing. He had abandoned 
the fraternity in disgust. 

Then, still seeking true peers, 
he had located scores of Persons 
who claimed to perceive sound as 
a visible phenomenon. He had 
even discovered a few who claim- 
ed to experience it as a tangible 
entity. 

Kert’s crest stiffened with bit- 
ter memory. Kert Tahn, adoles- 
cent, had known how the crystal- 
lized word glistened, how it shat- 
tered and splintered against the 
pavement. How it evaporated 
swiftly into the air. No one could 

LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



tell him it was spongy and gray 

or fluffy and pale. Or that it 
washed against the walls in rain- 
bow waves. 

And so at seventeen, his search 
complete, Kert had found himself 
alone in the city, unique. He had 
closed the city from his dreams. 
He had begun to listen for the call 
of the sky, dim, tantalizing eter- 
nally evanescing. 

The sky darkened now, veined 
, itself with lightning. Rain fell. 
Crest dampened, Kert returned 
to his apartment to drug himself 
into black sleep. 

Morning came. Kert fueled 
himself with a handful of nutri- 
caps and boarded the ziptube 
early, knotted with tension. 

Special Persons Headquarters, 
mid-city, was a massive pink hive. 
The Person at the desk rubbed 
her medallion in liorny fingers, 
clacked corneous ridges that serv- 
ed for teeth and proffered papers 
of employment. “Are you ac- 
quainted with the Bureau’s pay 
scale, Mr. Tahn?” 

“I am.” He scrawled his name, 
the track of a bird. He backed 
away from her terrible smile. 

'‘T^he ziptube deposited Him near 
-®- Rural Welfare Division at 
city-perimeter. He was directed 
to the west wing of the complex. 
There a receptionist escorted 
Mm directly to Mr. Daimler, Di- 
rector of Transport. 



13 



Daimler jellied from his chair, 
beaming fatly. Greedy black eyes 
gobbled Kert from crest to toe. 
“AH, well! A Koverman wKo looks 
like He really belongs in the sky!” 
Despite Eis grotesque bulk, Daim- 
ler wore no medalHon. “You’ve 
signed papers of employment, I 
presume?” 

“I Have.” Kert’s crest flattened 
involuntarily witH distaste. 

Daimler beamed greedily. 
“Good! We’re starved for Hover- 
men this season. I’ll escort you 
to die shed myself, Kertis. You’ll 
want to see your sHip, discuss 
your duties.” 

Reluctantly, Kert let Himself be 
maneuvered out the door, down 
the hallway. 

“I presume you’re a city boy, 
Kertis?” Daimler quivered with' 
massive good will. 

“I was born in one of the rural 
settlements.” 

“AH, well! THen you’ll know all 
about Spring Mission. Which set- 
tlement claims you, Kertis?” 

Kert’s forehead creased. “I was 
orphaned out early. I grew up in 
the city.” The words ground 
througK his teeth’ in splinters. 

“Ah! A shame! You missed a 
wonderful opportunity to grow 
up in the Rural America of the 
Twenty-First Century,” Daimler 
caroled. “This is the true age of 
individualism, Kertis. During 
Spring Mission our caseworkers 
will visit scores of communities, 
14 



each with its own rich Heritage, 
no two alike. Completely unlike 
the America of the last century, 
a homogeneous society, composed 
of homogeneous individuals — 
and each community like every 
other in social structure and con- 
tent.” 

Kert’s body tightened ominous- 
ly- 

“Of course, there is a certain 
isolationism involved.” Daimler 
burbled. “Many Special Persons 
are unable to adjust to the de- 
mands of society — or even to 
contact with it. Our workers visit 
and evaluate hundreds of solita- 
ries, People who see no Human 
face other than the caseworker’s 
from year to year. And of coiuse 
there are isolated family units as 
well. Our semi-annual distribu- 
tion of commodities is a mam- 
moth task in itself. And before it 
can be begun, our workers must 
visit and evaluate each communi- 
ty, each isolated family unit, each 
individual solitary.” 

They had traversed the Divi- 
sion complex to the hangars. A 
vast empty area spread before 
them, stained with oil and strewn 
with tools. 

“The fleet has already lifted 
out for the day.” Daimler jellied 
across the hangar floor. “Now, 
I’ve assigned you one of our old- 
er vehicles, Kertis. Today I want 
you to loft up, get the feel of it. 
Then drop in at the ops suite 

GALAXY 



and peruse our files. Tomorrow 
you will carry three workers into 
one of our older, better developed 
areas. Later, if you measure up. 
I’ll assign you a more challenging 
route.” 

But Kert didn’t hear. His eyes 
narrowed upon the small blue 
hovercraft that squatted on the 
hangar floor, rusted, sun-faded, 
dimmed with years. His body stif- 
fened. His breath caught, stopped. 

Daimler echoed vainly, from 
afar. Kert Tahn stood alone in 
the world with the small blue 
hoverdish. 

His legs moved, took him in 
slow circuit about tlie dish. His 
lungs drew breath again and deep 
within him something pulsed and 
throbbed. 

He had searched the city, 
searched the sky, searched a thou- 
sand empty hours of his life, for 
something that had no name. All 
that time, the dish had waited 
here. 

Had waited rusting and fading. 

Kert made a second circuit of 
the dish. He catalogued the work 
that cried to be done, the deep 
cleaning inside and out, the rub- 
bing and polishing, the loving and 
cherishing. 

II 

D aimler’s voice penetrated 
Kelt’s consciousness again. 
“I suppose it does look a trifle 
LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



rough, Kertis. But our clikf me- 
chanic ran a general overhaul 
just last month in preparatiiwi for 
Spring Mission. The ship is in ex- 
cellent mechanical repair, I as- 
sure you.” His voice worried upon 
the need to sky the ship immedi- 
ately, upon the urgency of the 
Mission, upon the crushing rural 
caseload. 

Even as Daimler spoke, Kert’s 
mind moved quickly, incisively 
upon the problem of the blue 
dish. He considered, debated — 
and decided upon his strategem. 

He set his profile distastefully, 
flared back his crest. “I v/ouldn’t 
loft in this plate if you paid me 
solid platinum.” The words rfiat- 
tered upon the hangar floor in 
dark crystals of scorn. 

Daimler stared at him, uncom- 
prehending. 

Kert stepped over his sbarded 
words. “Call Jobs One. SheTl can- 
cel my papers of employment.” 

Kert had reached the hangar 
door before Daimler legmned 
himself. “Kertis! You can’t 
mean — ” 

“I do mean.” Kert slid the door 
between them, decisively. 

From the street, Kert looked 
back to the hangar where the 
blue craft sheltered. Anxiety stab- 
bed him, a cold steel blade. 

It was, after all, strictly a gam- 
ble that he could mampidate 
Daimler and Jobs One, that He 
could win his way with the blue 

15 



Koverdish. It was purely a gamble 
that Daimler was desperate 
enough for hovermen to take Kert 
on Kert’s own terms. 

Frowning inwardly, Kert hoard- 
ed the ziptube. 

His apartment gleamed witH 
metallic everyday oddments pol- 
isKed into bits of metal sculpture. 
Kert polished at fiis treasures witB 
salty palms, waiting. 

An Hour passed. THe wallphone 
summoned. 

Metal clattered from Kert’s 
bands. “Yes?” 

Jobs One regarded Him anxious- 
ly* “Mr. Tahn, Mr. Daimler is 
very agitated. He fells me you re- 
fused to fly for him. I explained 
that surely tfiere was some mis- 
take, that he Had misunderstood 
you.” 

“I told him I wouldn’t loft his 
disH for soUd platinum.” 

Jobs One blancHed. “Mr. 
TaHn!” SHe leaned earnestly in- 
to the screen. “Mr. Tahn, please. 
I was so upset, I computed all the 
factors again. To be sure I Hadn’t 
made some terrible mistake tHe 
first time. Really, Mr. Tafin, tHe 
job is very ideal — much better 
than an 3 rtHing else available just 
now. Can’t you at least be more 
specific in your reasons for re- 
fusal?” 

“I can. THe disH filtKy. Half 
a dozen dents in the shell. Instru- 
ments greasy inside and out. 
Paint drilled wHere it isn’t cKip-

ped off or rusted away entirely. 
If the power plant matches the 
exterior, I could fall like a rock. 
If you’ll look, you’ll see my 
shoulders are bare — I’m a bird 
without wings.” 

“But Mr. Tahn! Mr. Daimer 
wouldn’t loft caseworkers in a 
disH tHat wasn’t airwortKy. I’m 
sure tHey’ve been simply too rusK- 
ed to perform non-essential main- 
tenance.” 

Kert regarded Her scornfully. 
He reached to break circuit. 

SHe sighed Helplessly. “All right. 
I’ll speak to Mr. Daimler again. 
I’ll suggest He call in a cleaning 
crew. PerHaps we can even — ” 

“No!” Tfie word leapt up his 
throat, gasKing His. lip. 

He wiped blood from His lip. 
“I’ll clean it myself.” 

Her eyes widened. 

SHe frowned. TKen her face blos- 
somed. 

“Why tKen of course! As often 
as I’ve scanned your file, I should 
Have guessed. You want to polish 
tHe dish yourself. I’ll call Mr. 
Daimler ri^t away. 1’U — ” 

He withdrew His thoughts from 
Her. 

Frowning, He considered tHe 
materials he would need to make 
tHe disH blue as the sky, ligKt as 
a cloud, as sHining in body as in 
soul. 

He jotted His list, then sfiaft- 
ed to street level. Triumph cried 
a fierce song in fiis Heart. 

GALAXY 



Qome of tHe cleaning products 
^ he required were popular and 
widely distributed. Others were 
more difficult to locate. Kert 
pushed his way from shop to 
shop, glaring fiercely into the dim 
March sun. Clerks quivered and 
wilted under his razor sharp de- 
mands. 

Then the bulky rainbow of jugs 
was heaped into the rented carry- 
cart. The cart wheeled faithfully 
in Kerfs wake through the noon 
crowd, losing him only once 
briefly. 

The hangar stood empty except 
for the blue disH and, beneath it, 
the mechanic. At Kerfs approach, 
the mechanic scrambled up, 
twitched nervously and spidered 
away, oddly jointed fingers flex- 
ing at the ends of long, thrice-el- 
bowed arms. 

Metal shelves lined the Hangar 
wall. Kert arranged his cleaning 
products upon the shelves. Each 
container carried a glowing skull 
and crossbones. Each responded 
to the touch of his hand with its 
insistently shrill audible warn- 
ing: “Contents of this container 
harmful or fatal if taken internal- 
ly. Under penalty of law, keep 
this container beyond the reach 
of children.” 

Kert escorted the emptied car- 
rycart to the hangar door and 
triggered its homing circuit. It 
whirred smoothly away. 

He paced around the blue dish 

iriTLE BLUE HAWK 



slowly, almost ritually, re-estab- 
lishing communion. Finally saMs- 
fied, he took from the shelf a 
large violet jug. He unlidded the 
container, sniffed the contents. 

“Contents of this container 
harmful if taken internally,” the 
jug insisted. “Under penalty of 
law — ” 

Kert pinched his nostrils shut, 
tilted back his head. He <drank 
deeply. 

He set the violet jug back on 
the shelf. He breathed deeply, 
evenly, as the cleanser burned 
down his throat. His vision blur- 
red, then cleared. He rolled up 
the sleeves of his coveralls, fleaed 
his fingers experimentally. 

The hangar door slid noisily. 
Daimler jellied into the Hangar, 
a beaming mound. “Kertis! My 
chief mechanic told me you’d re- 
turned. You’ve already begun 
work, I see.” 

“I have.” Kert regarded ISm 
through slitted eyes. He rubbed at 
the skin of the blue Koverdish 
with the palm of his Hand, frown- 
ing. The violet product was not 
yet sufficiently metabolized to cut 
the surface dullness. 

“Ah, well! How very fortunate 
that we were able to correct our 
misimderstanding. The dish is in 
excellent mechanical condition, I 
assure you. It was custom-made 
for a private citizen who willed 
it to us upon his death a few 
years ago. It’s a splendid little 

17 



ship, one of a kind — but I sup- 
pose we Save let it become a bit 
sliabby,” 

Kert said sharply, “It's carry- 
ing five years of film.” 

Daimler quivered. “Exactly, ex- 
actly!” He cried, in eager expia- 
tion. He cleared Kis tHroat, cough- 
ed and gestured expansively. “But 
I presume, Kertis, that you can 
have it in satisfactory condition 
in a day or two.” 

Kerf shuddered as the cleansing 
product reached his pores in a 
hot, wet flash. His eyes over- 
flowed with tears. Blinking, he 
rubbed at the hoverdisK with the 
outside flesh of his forearm. He 
tried the inner flesh of the other 
arm, nodded with satisfaction. 

“Within three days, perhaps?” 
Daimler suggested hopefully. 
“It’ll be done when it’s done.” 
“Well, ah — just do what- 
ever — ” Daimler gestured nerv- 
ously. “I won’t keep you any 
longer, Kertis. Let me know when 
you’re ready to be scheduled.” 
Kert stared after Daimler, then 
glared distastefully at Daimler’s 
crystallic wordage melting mes- 
sily on the hangar floor. He kick- 
ed aside his own splintered words. 
He flexed his fingers experiment- 
ally. 

'^he blue hoverdish responded 
gratefully to his rubbing fin- 
gers, his polishing palms. He set- 
tled to work, oblivious to every- 

18 



tiling but the tarnished blue dish 
and its wishful soul. 

The worst disfigurement was 
the overall dullness that masked 
the craft inside and out, conceal- 
ing texture and grain and dim- 
ming body and soul. 

It was a dullness that lay ev- 
erywhere, spread over the world 
like a thin gray pall. At first 
Kert’s apartment had been dreary 
widi it. He had spent months of 
his free time rubbing and polish- 
ing, making himself one place in 
the world that shone true. In the 
process, he had reached a conclu- 
sion about the nature of the pall. 

It was simply the final end 
product of the process of speech. 

It was the last minute residue 
left by the apparently fast-evap- 
orating words that fell from the 
careless lips of the world. 

Kert Had been deeply shock- 
ed at first to realize that the spok- 
en word did not evaporate com- 
pletely. Instead, each word left 
an imperceptible drift of matter, 
invisible by itself but — com- 
bined with a million like itself — 
clearly, appallingly visible. Ac- 
cepting this theory had meant re- 
nouncing his firmest conviction 
about the nature of speech. 

But he had made the renuncia- 
tion. And now, as he worked at 
the hoverdish, his conclusion was 
reconfirmed. 

The dullness lay over the dish’s 
interior in pronounced layers 

GALAXY 



v;Hich brought to mind verbal 
fingerprints. Although' all were of 
the same general nature, each lay- 
er, upon close inspection, had 
strikingly individual characteris- 
tics. If labeled samples had been 
available, Kert could have iden- 
tified the individual responsible 
for each thin layer of the pall. 

The individual layers differed 
in composition as well as appear- 
ance. Kert had to spot test each 
thin layer carefully to determine 
which cleaning agent would yield 
best results. Some layers sloughed 
off easily. Others required intensi- 
fied effort. 

Finally late Friday, a week 
later, Kert circled the ship, a 
gaunt and ravaged hawk. His 
hands and arms were raw with 
running sores. His crest drooped. 
His eyes were puffed, his tongue 
a mass of lumps. Throat and in- 
testines burned poisonously. His 
breath hung in fuming clouds. 

But the initial cleaning was 
done. 

Kert slumped against the hov- 
erdish. Despair crystallized with- 
in him as he watched the late af- 
ternoon crowd of caseworkers gag- 
gle through the hangar. Young and 
old, normal and medallioned, 
their common identifying charac- 
teristic was that they talked — 
and talked and talked, strewing 
behind them a crystaUic rubble 
of dissolving wordage. 

Kert Had found their gabbing 
LIHLE BLUE HAWK 



numbers more ominous each day 
of the week. Now they hurried 
past His immaculate hoverdish 
again, heedlessly strewing their 
verbal pall, 

Kert jerked, startled by an 
even more unwelcome voice. 

“All, well! I see you’ve com- 
pleted your polishing, Kertis.” 
Daimler quivered in a heap at 
Kert’s side. An aggressive gleam 
lit his damp eye. “I believe you 
are ready, in fact, to carry a few 
passengers for me.” 

Kert tried to match Daimler’s 
aggressive tone. “I am not. It will 
take me another five days to sand 
and paint the outer shell. Then I 
may be ready.” The words fell 
with an empty rattle. 

Daimler jellied sternly around 
the hoverdish. “No, Kertis, you 
have pursued your whim long 
enough. I fear I can’t see that you 
have accomplished anything no- 
table in the week I’ve already 
given you. Beyond blistering 
yourself raw and fuming tlie 
hangar with your chemicals.” 
Kerfs crest flared fiercely. 
“You can’t see? You aren’t blind, 
are you? You have eyes. You — ” 
“Oh, you’ve cleaned the uphol- 
stery, swept away tli'e bread 
crumbs, polished the trim a bit. 
But — ” He hoisted a hand 
against Kerfs protest. “ — I fear 
I will have to ask you to continue 
your ministrations on your own 
time. You’ve grounded my craft 

19 



for a week, you know. You’ve col- 
lected full hover pay for work a 
cleaning crew could have accom- 
plished in half a day. Now, I have 
posted next week’s schedule in the 
ops suite. I fear, Kertis, that if 
you fail to meet your schedule, I 
will feel compelled to lay com- 
plaint before the hovermen’s 
guild.” 

Kert clenched blistered fists 
helplessly. Of course Daimler 
couldn’t see. His eyes were blind 
to the graying layer that hung 
over the hangar, over the world. 

“And then you would lose the 
little ship you regard so fondly, 
Kertis. So drop by the ops suite 
before five. And — happy Hover- 
ing” 

Kert glared after Daimler. He 
pounded his fists in inarticulate 
rage. 

Ill 

T Tis schedule was, posted prom- 
inently in the ops suite. He 
scanned it with darkening rage. 
Daimler Had scheduled his ver- 
baceous caseworkers into Kert’s 
dish in a patternless musical 
chairs. In the course of the week, 
Kert would carry thirteen differ- 
ent workers in the craft. 

That meant thirteen different 
vocal patterns layered over the 
now-immaculate interior of the 
craft. Thirteen different patterns 
to be scrubbed and polished away 
20 



at week’s end. Gallons of cleanser 
to be ingested, metabolized, to 
bum down his guts and sear out 
his pores. 

In blind rage, Kert hurdled 
from the ops suite, hawked 
through the halls. 

Halfway to Daimler’s office, 
he folded against a wall, the driv- 
ing vitality of rage spent. 

His mind tore at the dilemma. 
If Kert defied Daimler and Daim- 
ler filed complaint, the guild 
would suspend his license for a 
year. He would, inevitably, lose 
the blue hoverdisK. 

But if he yielded to Daimler . 

Weakly he pulled himself erect. 
He clutched his medallion in de- 
spair. 

And the syllables of salvation 
whispered quietly into his mind. 

Christian Yorber. 

Counselor Yorber, the man le- 
gally and morally responsible for 
Special Person Kertis Tahn’s 
haelth, welfare and pursuit of 
happiness. 

Yorber had to help. 

Provided Kert could demon- 
strate that his health and welfare 
were dependent upon Yorber’s 
intervention. 

Kert’s crest flared. He winged 
to the hangar, to the wallph'one in 
one dim corner. He punched. 

Copper and scarlet filled the 
viewscreen. “Special Persons Bu- 
reau. Wiich desk, please?” 

“Counselor Yorber.” 



GALAXY 



A moment, and Yorber’s secre- 
tary regarded Him sternly. “Yes, 
Mr. Tahn?” 

“I need counsel. I’m coming. 
Now.” 

Distress eroded Her counten- 
ance. “Counselor is preparing to 
leave immediately for tHe week- 
end. I must ask you to accept an 
appointment.” Her eyes sliifted 
quickly to tHe appointment cHart. 

“I’ll lie tfiere in Half an hour.” 
Kert broke tHe circuit. 

He showered in the locker 
room and slapped on a tunic. As 
He shaped His crest, His eyes scan- 
ned His mirrored image. Puffed 
eyes watered. Sores, scrubbed free 
of scab oozed. He pincHed His 
lips. Blood spotted througH crack- 
ed membranes. 

Satisfied, He Hawked into the 
late afternoon crowd. The pedes- 
trians turned to stare at tHe gaunt 
Hawk with eyes of fire. 

Kert presented Himself, stiff- 
sHouldered and uncompromising, 
at tHe secretary’s desk. “I’ve come 
for counsel.” 

THe secretary escorted him to 
the inner office immediately but 
stonily. 

C Hristian Yorber, a gray man, 
sat framed against a gray 
wall, beHind a gray desk. His gray 
eyes narrowed as fie scanned his 
client. Yorber’s body was sligKt, 
his features nondescript. But His 
voice, crisp and clear, formed 
LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



word-jewels of brilliant color. 
“Sit down, Kertis. Wfiat’s tfie 
story?” 

Kert externalized tHe narrative 
in Hard, dark crsrstals. 

Listening, Yorber hoisted one 
pale eyebrow. Finally fie nodded. 
“Yes. I appreciate that tfie atua- 
tiort might act detrimentally up- 
on your HealtH and general wel- 
fare.” 

He leaned back, his lips firmly 
shut. 

Kelt’s crest twitcHed. He tight- 
ened His own lips, controlled His 
impulse to angry speech. 

Finally, coolly, Yorber nodded 
again. Wiffi a fingertip, fie traced 
a pattern on his desktop. “I’m 
sure you realize there is no ra- 
tional necessity to keep tHe Hov- 
ercraft scrubbed free of a pall 
that is, after all, visible only to 
you.” 

Kert stiffened. “I have tfie rigKt 
to my obsessions and compul- 
sions. Article 15, tHe Special Con- 
stitution for Disadvantaged Citi- 
zens.” 

“Afi, the Special Constitution.” 
Yorber smiled faintly. “I wonder 
How well you are acquainted wtH 
the history of tfie Special People.” 

“Very well,” Kert said, sharp- 
ly — but vainly. 

Yorber invariably took a quick 
run tfirougH tHe history of tfie dfe- 
advantaged while His mind sorted 
tHe problem at Hand. 

“It was late in tfie last cen- 

21 



tury when certain groups of bio- 
chemists made their premature 
efforts at genetic manipulation of 
human stock.” Yorber’s words 
fell upon the desktop in glowing 
crystals. “They enjoyed some 
spectacular successes at first. 
Highly publicized successes. But 
those were soon overshadowed 
by their failures, individuals 
hardly human in form but, once 
created, nevertheless entitled to 
the same rights as any normal 
citizen — life, liberty, pursuit 
of happiness. 

“In the end laws were formu- 
lated to bring an end to genetic 
dabbling. But those, of course, 
provided no relief for those thou- 
sands of special individuals al- 
ready created. There were the 
physically malformed, the meta- 
bolically disturbed, and — per- 
haps most important — those 
who suffered drastically altered 
processes of thought and percep- 
tion: people who heard different 
voices, saw different stars, 
plunged away in pursuit of fan- 
tasies never dreamed before. 

“All of them required special 
help, of one type or another. And 
so the Special Persons Bureau 
was chartered to protect the right 
of the genetically disadvantaged 
to live out their lives in their own 
fa^on, provided they offered 
no harm to the general popula- 
tion. 

“That involved the right to 
22 



seek companionship, to marry, to 
produce young — which compli- 
cated the Bureau’s job immeasur- 
ably. Today the genetically al- 
tered have married out widely 
into the normal world, dissemin- 
ating their altered genetic materi- 
al into the population at large. 
And the Bureau finds itself min- 
istering to an ever-increasing pro- 
portion of the population. Each 
year thousands of newborn are 
added to the caseload. And each 
individual on the rolls is entitled 
to full service, even though chro- 
mosomal studies may show that 
he carries only minor genetic al- 
teration. 

“Of course if all our clients 
were genetically normal, there 
would nevertheless be a certain 
number of harmless nuts among 
them, a certain number of mental 
deficients, a certain number of 
hopeless insane. And none of them 
could command any special con- 
sideration. 

“But imder the Special Consti- 
tution, they must be considered 
Special People first, nuts second. 
They can demand that their ec- 
centricities be elevated to the lev- 
el of constitutional rights.” 

Kert’s face darkened. 

“The system does have a cer- 
tain charm,” Yorber mused. “The 
Bureau has been able to integrate 
the harmless, garden-variety nut 
into the community simply by 
hanging a medallion at his neck

and telling him to run to us if 
the world doesn’t treat Him rigHt. 
John D, Citizen is warned by 
the medallion — if not by some 
conspicuous pKysical abnormality 
— that he may be dealing with a 
nut. He treads lightly. In our own 
modest way, we’ve converted an 
unwieldy mass of nuts and cranks 
into reasonably productive citi- 
zens.” 

Kert’s eyes hooded dangerous- 
ly- 

''^orber’s gray eyes flickered 
over him assessingly. “Well, 
to get down to cases, Kert — as 
your counselor, I can involve my- 
self in the situation by manipu- 
lating Daimler into making cer- 
tain concessions. I can request 
him, in my official capacity, to 
schedule the same two or three 
caseworkers into your hovercraft 
each day.” 

“You can,” Kert said tautly. 
“But will that solve the basic 
problem, Kert?” 

Kert didn’t reply. 

“Will that eliminate this pall 
that you see spread over the 
world? Will it relieve your com- 
pulsive need to erase the pall, 
even at the cost of your health?” 
Kert spoke deliberately. “I’ve 
told you before. I will not — ” 
“Submit to Hs^pno-therapy?” 
Yorber allowed himself a small, 
still smile. “You know, it’s about 
time you threw this perceptual al- 
24 



batross off your neck. Kerf. 
Daimler would gladly grant you 
a week’s leave of absence for ther- 
apy. And our specialists could 
free you, Kert. They could erase 
this pall from your mind, where 
it really exists. Think, Kert!” 
Kert spoke in icy crystals. “I 
have thought. My answer remains 
— no.” 

A single crease marred Yor- 
ker’s forehead. His jaw Harden- 
ed then relaxed. He sighed irrita- 
bly. “Very well. Step into the 
outer office whUe I wave my ma- 
gic wand.” His hands moved to 
the callphone. 

Kert paced the outer office. 
Finally the intercom blinked. The 
secretary said, “You may re-en- 
ter, Mr. Tahn.” 

Yorber smiled complacently. 
“Well, I got farther than I ex- 
pected, Kert. Stuck a few pins in- 
to Daimler. He’s agreed to assign 
a single caseworker as your regu- 
lar passenger. A Special Person, 
at that — ’Drick Ritter. Oddly 
enough, Ritter is the caseworker 
who carried you into the city one 
fine day over twenty years ago. 
And so contributed immeasurably 
to my life’s load of discord.” 
Kert’s nostrils flared. “He — 
brought me out?” 

“He brought you out of the 
wilderness in his arms. And next 
week you’ll be carrying him into 
the same wilderness in your hov- 
ercraft.” 



GALAXY 



Kert’s mind spun wildly at the 
revelation. 

“I’ve always said I’d be pleased 
to answer questions about your 
family background,” Yorber mur- 
mured. “Provided you make one 
concession to me.” 

Kert blinked at Kim stupidly. 
Then he understood. “I won’t go 
into Kypno-analysis. I won’t let 
anyone put me under.” 

Yorber leaned across Kis desk 
persuasively. “Kert, a week in tKe 
lab could be a fistful of pure 
platinum. Even if we just ordered 
an analysis, without attempting 
any reconstruction. Think ! As 
matters stand, I can’t distinguisH 
which of your problems are pri- 
marily genetic in origin and which 
are neurotic. But with an analysis 
report in hand — ” 

“No,” Kert uttered. “No. And 
never.” 

Then he was in the street, diz- 
zy with turmoil. 

’Prick Ritter — the man who 
Had carried Kert out of Rural 
America. A man who must Have 
known Kert’s mother, his father. 
’Drick Ritter — who could look 
into Kert’s eyes and speak His 
true name. 

Kert p>ounded pavement under- 
foot, trying to distance himself 
from the specter of ’Drick Ritter. 
Christian Yorber came to mind. 
Kert’s thoughts flashed angrily 
over the counselor. 

Kert knew wKat Yorber want- 
LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



ed. Yorber wanted to wrench’ 
open the box labeled Kertis 
Tahn and putter about inside, 
picking up pieces, fitting them 
together. Then when he was done, 
he could point triumphantly to 
the completed puzzle. “Look,” he 
could say. “This is you, Kertis 
Tahn.” 

This is you. All these angry 
years you’ve tried to get your 
own hands on these bits and 
pieces, to fit them into a whole. 
And you couldn’t. 

Well, now I’ve done it for you. 
Here you are. Look and see, Kert- 
is Tahn. 

Look and see. 

Then it would be: “Now, ob- 
serve! If I throw out these three 
pieces here and Have the hypno- 
lab cut me a single piece to fit 
— notice how the overall picture 
is improved, Kert? Simple, isn’t 
it? 

“Well, then what about these 
four pieces over here, Kert? Do 
we need them? And the two in 
that comer? Then perhaps — ” 

Kert Tahn slapped city pave- 
ment underfoot. Electrical dis- 
charges arced through' His mind, 
blinding him. His feet picked 
their own path.

H e reached the hangar at dusk. 

The hoverdish waited, pale, 
still rusty. As dusk grayed into 

25 



darkness, tHe disH floated, ligKt 
and blue, across tlie valley and 
into the mountains, 

A rocky shelf jutted from the 
mountainside, High and chill — 
Kert’s place. TKe disH settled 
deftly. Wind glanced across the 
shelf in violent sheets. 

Kelt hunkered on the rock. By 
moonlight, the KoverdisH was a 
ghostly bluebird, yearning up- 
ward. Whipped by wind, deafen- 
ed, Kert saw the entire vision of 
the blue dish for the first time. 
And he acknowledged the right- 
ness of the dish of ’Drick Ritter, 
of his own Spring Mission into 
Rural America in search of him- 
self. 

Compelled, he straightened to 
his feet. In the transforming 
moonlight, he felt himself rise 
weightless. His feet left the rocky 
shelf. His body drifted lightly, 
freely into the night sky. 

He closed his eyes, lifted his 
arms, threw back his head. His 
body arched and rose lightly 
through thick layers of cloud. 
Moonlight condensed on his crest. 

A moment, an eternity — and 
he felt himself slowly sinking 
back. 

The enchantment was broken. 
He glanced down. 

His feet rested solidly upon 
the rocky shelf. 

The fantasy of flight fled. The 
wind rocked him off his feet. 

He crouched in a rocky hollow, 
26 



still dazed by the experience that 
had seemed so real, had been so 
false. 

His fingers polished at His me- 
dallion. He let the night and the 
bitter cold fill him. 

An hour, and He re-united him- 
self with the hoverdish. They 
lifted into a cloud-whipped sky. 

Kert rode the mountains. The 
ship responded smoothly to his 
command, rising with a powerful 
rush, falling softly, lightly. 

But soon the mechanics of 
flight became clumsy and artifi- 
cial. Kert lifted above the moun- 
tains, moved upon night in its 
high kingdom. Then he let his 
Hands move of their own will. 
They deadened the artificial, the 
clumsy — the powerplant. 

He caught his breath and held 
it. His nerve endings moved out 
to the far points of the hover- 
craft’s shell. The dish’s outer skin 
became his own. Instruments 
flashed messages directly into his 
mind. The rush of air was wind in 
his crest. He was falling. 

Air rushed up, icy, frictive. 
Moimtains rose, cragged. The 
hoverdish splashed down through 
moist cloud layers. The moon 
quivered and turned black. 

Kert Tahn shuddered back into 
his fleshy body. Frost-stiffened 
fingers found the power switch. 

The powder plant hummed. The 
ship caught its footing in the icy 
air and held. 



GALAXY 



Kert huddled in tfie ship, dis- 
appointment an icy wedge in fiis 
cHest. It Had been insane to ex- 
pect the blue disR to fly witKout 
power. A Koverdish was of the 
earth, massy, subject to gravity. 
A Koverdish was not a bird, to 
soar encKanted on wings of moon- 
llgKt. 

But an inner voice had said. 
Try. And Ke Kad tried. 

Now the rusty pox on the ship’s 
blue skin took his eye. His mind 
fastened on it. His fingers twitch- 
ed restlessly. 

The ship swooped competently 
into the city and settled into the 
deserted hangar. Kert stood, de- 
flated, gathering at reserves of 
strength and determination. His 
crest stiffened angrily. 

In the dimness, he Hoisted a 
protesting jug of cleanser and 
glugged the foaming stuff, gag- 
ging. He shuddered violently. He 
polished at the body rust with 
bands that cracked and laced the 
floor with blood. 

I t was late Saturday when he 
threw himself into the clean- 
ed and sanded ship to sleep with 
his head pillowed on the controls. 

Late Sunday the metamorpho- 
sis was complete. The ship stood 
proudly in its fresh skin, blue as 
sky, looking as if it might loft up 
unpowered. 

Kert never remembered return- 
ing to his apartment. He never 
LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



remembered falling to the floor, 
crusted witH blood, smeared with 
paint, reeking with chemical per- 
spiration. 

But there he found himself 
Monday dawn. 

The carpet swam into focus. 
Beyond lay a pale limb, ruined 
— Kerfs arm. He raised it stiff- 
ly and stared at it. Shuddering, 
he groaned to his feet. The sky 
swept past his window, gray and 
uncaring. 

Kert staggered to the shower. 
Water needled his ruined flesh, 
sloughing it away in dead patch- 
es. A new skin emerged taut and 
red, tender. 

Kert staggered from the stall, 
swayed against a wall, dizzy. The 
world tilted and rocked. Kert 
groped for his gray coverall. The 
garment rippled on its hanger, 
wriggled out of hand. 

Kert lunged. His fingers caught 
the elusive fabric and clung. He 
lidded his eyes against the quak- 
ing universe. 

Eventually he opened his eyes. 
The world had stabilized. He 
extended one foot gingerly. The 
floor did not rock. The coverall 
peeled off its hanger. 

He shrugged into the coverall 
and slid protective gauntlets over 
the tender new skin of his hands. 
He hid his bloodshot eyes behind 
dark goggles. He shaped his crest. 
Then, ravenous, he hawked to the 
serving panel.

But before His breakfast ma- 
terialized, tlie callpHone sum- 
moned. 

“Ah, well! I’m delighted to find 
you up, Kertis.” Daimler’s face 
cpngealed upon the wall. “I pre- 
sume you know that Counselor 
Yorber made a formal request 
concerning your schedule. And 
that I felt compelled to grant 
certain concessions.” 

“I do know,” Kert said stiffly. 
I am grateful.” 

Daimler’s eyes wallowed damp- 
ly. “Perhaps, Kertis! I Have reas- 
signed you to loft Senior Person 
Ritter, who has served forty-three 
Spring Missions. Because of his 
Seniority, and in recognition of 
his very special gifts. Senior Per- 
son Ritter has been granted the 
privilege of serving as his own 
counsel. As you may know, the 
Bureau very rarely assigns this 
privilege, even to its most Senior 
clients. I explained these circum- 
stances to Counselor Yorber be- 
fore we reached agreement last 
Friday. I presume the counselor 
relayed this information to you.” 
Kert felt the world rock be- 
neath his feet. “He did not.” 
Daimler sighed wearily. “I fear- 
ed as much. Silence was, of 
course. Counselor Yorber’s pre- 
rogative. However! I presume you 
appreciate the full significance of 
the facts I have laid before you, 
Kertis. I hope you will not create 
difficulty for us all by attempting 
23 



to manipulate Person Ritter as 
you have manipulated Counselor; 
Yorber and me.” Kert stiffened, 

D aimler puffed his cheeks im- 
portantly. “Now! Senior 
Person Ritter has asked me to 
relay a few, umm, requests. First, 
you are to be prepared to lift 
off at 8:47 precisely. This is the 
exact hour and moment when 
Ritter expects to loft each morn- 
ing of Mission. Absolutely no de- 
viation permitted. Then you are 
never to speak to Ritter until he 
has first spoken to you — not 
upon any occasion, for any rea- 
son. You are never to wear or 
carry any article that is red. You 
are to wear nothing upon your 
hands or face. And you are never 
to look at Person Ritter’s feet. 
He is most emphatic about this 
last point. Never glance down- 
ward in such a way that your 
eyes might light upon his feet. 
Kert’s eyes flashed hawk-fire. 
“Spring Mission is far more 
important to the welfare of the 
People than any small inconven- 
ience you or I might suffer. I 
hope you will consider these re- 
quests as challenges, Kertis, rath- 
er than as restrictions.” Daimler 
bared sharp little teeth. He faded. 

Kert stared at the viewscreen 
with futile rage. He pulled off his 
gauntlets, stared at the taut, fra- 
gile new skin of his hands, vul- 
nerable, cracking. 



GALAXY 



He would lodge olficial protest. 
The gauntlets were a necessity to 
protect fiis fragile new sTcin from 
injury and infection. He would — 

His fists crashed upon the serv- 
ing counter. He would lodge no 
protest. He would uncover fiis 
hands and his eyes. He would un- 
buckle fiis chronometer until tfie 
red strap could be replaced witfi 
blue or black. He would not pre- 
sume to glance at Senior Person 
Ritter’s feet. He would not 
speak until spoken to. 

Furiously he flapped to the 
bathroom, sprayed his tender 
hands witfi medicated plastic. He 
lashed his Hands tfirougfi the air, 
drying the protective film. 

That Ritter had been created 
Senior Person was a rare honor 
indeed, signifying that his work 
was so important that fie was not 
to be frustrated in any manner, 
by any Person. That fie served 
as his own counsel implied spe- 
cial gifts of perception and judg- 
ment — and signified that any 
lesser individual, normal or Spe- 
cial, must fall under his command 
while within his Personal radius. 
There was no question of protest 
or resistance — merely concession 
or witfidrawal. 

Kert stalked tfie apartment. He 
saw now how vulnerable the blue 
ship made him. He could not hope 
to win a wrangle with ’Drick Rit- 
ter. Even if fie took the dispute 
to tfie highest level, fie would lose 
LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



Es case — and Es blue hover- 
dish. Tfie di^ forced him to ac- 
cept indigmties fie would not tol- 
erate if only a job were at stake. 

He smasHed tfie dark goggles to 
fiis bedroom floor and pcj^d 
dark contacts into his inflamed 
eyes. He snapped the chronometefi 
off its offensive red strap and 
slid the golden wafer into a 
pocket. 

Jaw set, he launched himself 
upon the world. 

He reached the hangar, and tfie 
blue hoverdish blazed out of tfie 
dimness. Kert felt his taut flesh! 
soothed, his angers diminisfied^ 
His gaze moved over tfie blue 
dish witfi joyous triumph. 

V 

■presently caseworkers trickled 
-*■ through tfie hangar. Kert in- 
itiated routine preparations for 
lift-off. 

The roofport dilated, and the 
hangar emptied. His own prepac- 
atioris complete, Kert polisHed at 
tfie sEp, mtent upon his crested 
reflection. 

Witfiout warning, a second re- 
flection loomed out of the ship’s 
blue skin. There was a pair of 
wildly slanted eyes, a small, 
crease- calipered mouth, a nimbus 
of fiair. 

Kert whirled. 

Semor Person Ritter regarded 
Em from violet eyes. He was sL 

29 



}3ent, elfin Person, deeply tanned, 
wndly fialoed witH wliite Kair. His 
coverall was violet velvet. Over 
Eis Eeart he bore a printed pre- 
caution: 

“Do not speak until spoken 
to. 

Never look down at my feet. 

Do not serve me with a 
gloved Hand. 

Do not cause me to see the 
color red. 

Under penalty of law, swift 
and certain.” 

At his chest Kung the massive 
medallion of the Senior Person. It 
caved His thin shoulders. His 
Voice was a windblown echo. “We 
meet again. Little Blue Hawk.” 

A beast leapt in Kelt’s chest. 
He scraped at his throat, useless- 
ly. No words materialized. 

A small, strange smile moved 
across Ritter’s face, a cloudy sha- 
dow. He clasped His hands before 
him and moved the fingers in a 
quick, meaningless ritual. “Our 
good friend Yorber told you, Tm 
sure, that I am the Person who 
carried you from Rural America 
one Spring Mission many years 
ago.” 

“He did.” The words formed 
weakly without material sub- 
stance. 

The cloudy smile drifted 
across Ritter’s face again. “We 
ansv/ered a special call that Mis- 
sion. We visited the community 
of your birth out of scheduled or- 
30 



der, to relieve the People there 
of your care. No one could calm 
you. And your sharp cries stab- 
bed the ears, each scream calling 
up afresh the mystery, the trage- 
dy of your parents’ fate. As I car- 
ried you screaming to the ship, I 
thought my ears would spout 
blood.” The smile drifted away. 

The beast leapt again furiously. 
But Kelt could not word his de- 
mand. 

Ritter touched the blue Hover- 
dish thoughtfully. “You will see 
the place of your birth next Tues- 
day afternoon, if weather does not 
alter my schedule. You will be 
informed of the circumstances 
surrounding the tragedy — or mys- 
tery — of your mother and father. 

Kert’s crest flared. 

Ritter hoisted a Hand. “We 
must be airborne in precisely 
thirteen minutes, Blue Hawk. We 
will synchronize timepieces. Then 
we will speak no more. After loft- 
ing, you will fly directly into the 
sun, until I give new instructions.” 

When Kert did not acquiesce, 
Ritter presented his heavy medal- 
lion in the gesture of command. 

Kert sighed heavily. They syn- 
chronized timepieces. And thirteen 
minutes later the blue dish skim- 
med into the bleak March sun. 

The blue dish skimmed lop- 
sided, listing heavily to the rear. 

Kert scowled over the instru- 
ment panel in baffled anger. The 
ship handled like a badly loaded 

GALAXY 



freighter, crabbing awkwardly, 
nose high. He performed a quick 
series of tests vainly. Frowning, 
he put the ship on autoskim, pro- 
gramming compensatory adjust- 
ments. The ship nosed down, sta- 
bilized in the correct attitude. 

Kert scowled over the instru- 
ments. To His knowledge, the ship 
had been entirely in his care for 
the past week. And he had done 
nothing to affect its skimming at- 
titude. 

His eyes flickered over the pas- 
senger-check mirror. Ritter’s re- 
flected eyes met his. 

“Is it a critical matter? Likely 
to force us down in Rural Amer- 
ica?” 

Kert sighed. “It isn’t.” 

Ritter nodded. He clasped His 
hands and moved the violet-tip- 
ped fingers in the same nonsense 
ritual he had performed earlier. 
“Then I will dispense my in- 
structions for the mechanics of 
our vdsits — the landings, disem- 
barkations, boardings, loftings. 
My work proceeds much more 
smoothly if I conduct my com- 
ings and goings in certain pre- 
scribed ways.” 

Kert’s jaws knotted. “I fly the 
ship the way it’s got to fly.” 

The violet eyes slanted with 
displeasure. “I demand nothing 
that will compromise our safety. 
I speak of the manner and order 
in which certainly purely routine 
procedures are to be accom- 
LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



plished. I remind you that 1 am 
Senior.” 

Coldly, Kert swiveled to face 
his Senior. 

The pupils of Ritter’s vJoIet 
eyes dilated enormously. Ritter 
spoke. 

"O itter spoke of small rititals 
he would perform in the 
course of landing, of rituals lie 
would perform while disembark- 
ing and of others he would per- 
form on occasion when Kert ac- 
companied him into the forest. 

He spoke of rituals to be per- 
formed before lofting. He spoke 
of ritual activities he would per- 
form while they were in flight. 
And He spoke of small accommo- 
dations Kert would make to those 
rituals, small cues he would take 
from them, small gestures Kert 
would very occasionally be called 
upon to make in cooperation. 

“I do not expect your active 
participation in my rituals. I ex- 
pect you to refrain from voicing 
negative attitudes. I expect a cer- 
tain amount of intelligent coop- 
eration. If any request seenos like- 
ly to cause danger, you may voice 
your opinion. Do you under- 
stand?” 

A ritualist! Kert spoke in sylla- 
bles of stone. “I do.” 

Ritter was silent for a mo- 
ment. Then he issued directional 
instructions, enumerated and de- 
scribed landmarks. “Today we 

31 



will visit only solitaries,” lie ex- 
plained. “Most of our calls will 
be paper drops.” 

The first series of paper drops 
occupied the remainder of the 
morning. Approaching high', Kert 
would drop the blue dish swiftly 
through the trees into a small 
clearing. Ritter would disembark 
with elaborate ritual to fold a 
sheaf of papers into tlie scarlet 
copper box mounted someplace 
within the clearing. 

Then Ritter would prowl the 
clearing, head bowed, pupils di- 
lated and nostrils flared. Finally, 
returning to the ship, Ritter 
would sink to his seat, breathing 
harshly. Not until they had loft- 
ed would he begin work at his 
writing board, scrawling rapidly, 
as if recording the substance of an 
actual interview, one that had 
involved face-to-face confronta- 
tion. 

After their twelfth paper drop, 
noon hung overhead. Kert lofted 
high. 

Ritter slumped in his seat. 
“Hold altitude while I rest. Then 
I will give fresh instructions.” 

Kert held the dish high and 
steady. Below lay the forests and 
Hills of Rural America. Kert 
could distinguish lakes, tiny set- 
tlements, a few dim trails. But 
from that altitude, no human 
was visible. 

Nor any non-Human. 

Kert considered tlie forest be- 

32 



low speculatively. Why Had they 
simply left papers that morning? 
Were Ritter’s solitaries monsters 
and shy? Monsters and terrible? 
Or were they simply People? 

“A little of each,” Ritter re- 
sponded quietly. “Some fearful, 
some fearsome. Some barely Hu- 
man. Some all too Human.” 
A cloudy smile drifted across 
his features. “Now if you wiU 
move us due west, we will 
drop in upon a friend for lunch’.” 

Kelt’s hands froze on the con- 
trols. He stared at Ritter’s reflec- 
tion, and his mind groped at the 
answer he had received — to a 
question he hadn’t asked. Not 
aloud. 

Ritter’s voice, distracted, echo- 
ed his instructions again. He bent 
to his writing board. 

Kert’s hands moved over tKe 
controls woodenly. He guided the 
ship, trying not to think. 

^"T^he clearing was high in tlie 
wooded hills. Kert stepped 
from the saucer warily, braced for 
cold. 

Moist heat enveloped him. He 
stared at lush' vegetation. Vines 
dipped from treetops. Grass mat- 
ted tliickly underfoot. A cloud of 
insects boiled past. 

Kert gaped at the apparition at 
the clearing’s edge. The man 
stood like a rotting stump. A leafy 
cape hid his limbs. His beard was 
a tangle of vines. His cheeks were 

GALAXY 



furred witK brilliant moss. Only 
the foolishly broadening smile 
differentiated him from the vege- 
tation. 

The apparition turned and 
moved into the trees, his cape 
sweeping the thick grass. Ritter 
touched Kert’s arm, guiding him 

As they moved through the 
trees Kert wiped sweat from his 
face. His coverall dampened. An 
unnatural amount of sunlight 
played beneath tlie green roof of 
trees. 

A small tliatcfied cottage occu- 
pied the second clearing. With a 
swirl of his cape, their host wel- 
comed them, beaming foolishly. 

Kert’s eyes adjusted quickly to 
the interior. Sunlight filtered 
through narrow slots in the rough 
walls. The floor was packed dirt. 
In one corner was a heap of dried 
leaves for a bed. In another stood 
a low plank table spread with 
food. Shelves lined the walls. 
Dried provisions hung from raft- 
ers. 

Frowning, Kert looked back to 
the low table and the crude bowls 
of food. He stared around the 
single room. There was no fire- 
place, no stove, no heating unit 
of any kind. Yet the food steam- 
ed. With growing discomfort, 
Kert stared at their host. 

The stumpy man strode into 
the cottage. The leafy cloak rat- 
tled to the floor, and all the sun- 
light in the cottage focused upon 

LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



the naked, mossy form of Ifeeii! 
host. Golden rays lit him, learo^ 
the rest of the room in darkness^ 
His face was a piece of weather- 
ed wood, carved in lines of fool- 
ish pride. 

He bared his ruined teeth and 
beamed. “My food is your food.” 
With a sunstruck hand, he mo- 
tioned them to the low table. 

Ritter slid into place. Kert 
knelt beside him warily. Opporite, 
their host sank down in a blaze 
of sxmlight. His eyes had become 
golden orbs, molten. The food 
sent up a fresh cloud of steam. 
Kert’s forehead dampened in re- 
sponse. 

“We are grateful for your Hos- 
pitality,” Ritter murmured. He 
set his tongue to a spoonful of 
stearning food. Involuntarily he 
winced. 

Their host scowled. “You are! 
cold. Your food needs more heat.”' 
He focused his golden orbs upon: 
the table top. 

Kert gasped, his face seared. 

Ritter’s voice cut crisply 
through the steam. “We need less 
heat, John. Our food is too hot” 

Anger boiled in the golden orbs. 
The viny beard flapped indig- 
nantly. “You need hot food and 
warm shelter. You are too cold 
to function.” 

Ritter’s violet eyes dilated 
commandingly. “We cannot ac- 
cept more heat, John. We can- 
not accommodate these abrupt 

33 



and radical temperature cKanges.” 

John’s voice echoed hollowly. 
“I burned away winter so you 
could make your Mission here. I 
focused sunlight. I melted the 
snows and made water to feed 
the plants. I made the mosses 
proliferate, the vines flourish, 
die trees prosper. Now you say 
you do not need my Heat?” His 
naked chest swelled indignantly. 

Ritter Bowed his Head. “We are 
grateful, John. But we ask you to 
respect our pride. We are only 
men. If you give us too much of 
your light, too much of your Heat, 
we feel even smaller and more 
helpless than we are.” The violet 
eyes slanted persuasively. “You 
have already given us warmth 
and springtime, John'. Don’t give 
us more. Don’t diminish us fur- 
ther in your presence.” 

John’s eyes flared. He swelled 
jrnigK tily, mollified. He rumbled 
witH woody resonance, “I am 
your God.” 

The room cooled quickly. John 
blazed with the absorbed heat, 
then scattered it to light the dark- 
ened cottage. 

Ritter inclined His Head grate- 
fully. “As we eat, Kert, we must 
reflect upon all that John Has 
done for us.” 

John beamai. Kerf severed in 
his sweat-soaked coverall. 

Despite the chill, the food re- 
mained hot through the long 
meal. As they ate, Ritter and 
34 



John discussed the winter’s 
weather. Ritter produced a poucii 
of weather tapes. They played 
choice strips and discussed statis- 
tics. Finally they considered the 
possible course of the summer’s 
weather. 

The meal was done. John rose. 
“Your visit was appreciated. Per- 
son. Ritter. I have not yet decided 
how I will conduct the next win- 
ter. I will think, as I heat the for- 
est for summer. When you pay 
your autumn call, I may have 
good news for you.” 

“We will be grateful if you find 
it in your Heart to temper the 
cold,” Ritter murmured. 

John beamed benevolently. “I 
make no promises. We will dis- 
cuss it at Fall Misson.” 

Escaping, Kert and Ritter 
waded heat waves to the ship. 
Ritter collapsed in His seat. 
Kert worked the controls with 
slippery hands. 

They reached skim altitude. 
Ritter croaked, “Hold.” 

The ship cooled quickly. Rit- 
ter’s face regained color. 

VI 

T hey spent early afternoon re- 
trieving papers they had 
dropped that morning. In late 
afternoon, they dropped into a 
clearing ominously reminiscent of 
John’s. Strapping young oaks 
fenced the clearing. Underfoot, 

GALAXY 



seedlings broke soil aggressively. 

Ritter’s wiry body tiglitened. 
“I’ll ask you to accompany me 
again, Blue Hawk, You must ob- 
serve great care. Our friend Here 
is meek and Humble, He doesn’t 
realize tKe magnitude of tHe 
forces He controls.” 

Kert peered warily into tHe 
dense growtH. 

As they moved tlirough tlie 
trees, tHey Heard a distant voice 
raised plaintively. “At one time 
Twig worked in a tree nursery,” 
Ritter explained. “When it be- 
came apparent that He couldn’t 
remain there without endangering 
others, the Bureau evacuated him 
here. He has a demanding role to 
fill, rendering worship to all tKe 
trees on this Hillside. From tlie 
tone of today’s Hymn, I conclude 
he Has suffered a failure.” 

The sorrowful wail quavered 
through tKe trees. Pale crystals of 
sound rattled mournfully to the 
forest floor. 

THey stepped over a log into 
a small clearing. A newly fallen 
branch, leaves wilting, filled the 
clearing. THe sligKt, pale young 
man flung Himself about the 
stricken limb, mourning it witH 
penitential fervor. His eyes jerked 
convulsively. His hair grew rough 
and brown down his neck, like 
the bark of a tree. 

Finally liis voice broke. He col- 
lapsed across the fallen limb. 

Ritter spoke quietly. “Evidently 

LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



you’ve neglected your duties Here, 
Twig. This is too fine a brancH to 
Have been wrenched off by tKe 
wind.” 

Twig scrambled to His feet, a 
scrawny youth. His eyes jerked 
rapidly. “I know my sins! But I 
couldn’t prevent it! The wind 
just came — tearing!” He choked. 
“I’ve been here two days, trying 
to atone. I’ve prostrated myself. 
I’ve — ” 

“And wKile you’ve atoned, you 
Have also neglected your other re- 
sponsibilities. I felt the anger 
of tKe trees as I walked the path.” 

Twig’s barky Head wobbled. He 
whispered hoarsely. “There is a 
giant Root tearing into my gar- 
den plot already! I saw it yester- 
day, throbbing! And there is a 
BrancH tKat sweeps down every 
night and brushes my shelter 
roof — threatening!” 

Ritter nodded. “It was die same 
story in the city. You performed 
so poorly, the trees destroyed the 
entire nursery in anger. I hoped 
you might fare better Here. TKe 
trees are older, wiser, a little more 
patient.” 

Twig shuddered convulsively. 
“OK, the Trees Have been patient! 
And merciful’ THey Have permit- 
ted me a sinner, to worship at 
Their Roots. But now — ” His 
eyes jerked in error. “The wind 
came out of the north two nights 
ago, whipping and screaming. It 
came like a giant hand, thrashing 

35 



my Trees — and it threw this 
Limb at my feet! As if to show 
me I am not worthy to protect the 
Trees with my worship. Oh, I 
have sinned! I am a sinner and 
full of shame! I — ” 

Ritter moved to the primitive 
shelter beneath the trees. He 
squatted, drawing forms from his 
pouch. “Are you ready to make 
inventory. Twig? We must requi- 
sition everything you will need 
for the next six months.” 

Gulping, Twig squatted in the 
shadow of the shelter. “Will you 
take me back with you?” 

“No.” 

“But I’m in danger here! I’ll 
starve! The Root in my garden 
patch! And every night, when I 
try to sleep — ” 

"O itter slanted his violet eyes at 
the quivering youth. “I be- 
lieve you are capable of persuad- 
ing the root to withdraw.” 
Twig’s face contorted. “But 
they hate me! They’re threaten- 
ing me! They want me to die 
here! They — ” 

“If you can’t put your trees 
and their needs ahead of your own 
fears, what can you expect? You 
are their creature. They are en- 
titled to destroy you if you can’t 
render adequate service.” 

Twig’s head snapped up. His 
eyes glittered. “What did you 
ever do for the Trees? Nothing! 
But do They come scratching at 

36 



your roof at night? Do They 
creak over your head and lash out 
when you walk down the street? 
Do They mutter and groan when 
you want to rest in Their shade?” 
“I’m not their creature. I’ve 
never failed them, because I have 
no obligation to them. They are 
indifferent to me.” 

Twig jumped to his feet “You 
fail the Trees by never thinking 
of them. You fail the Trees — ” 

“I brought them you.” Ritter 
stood, folding away papers. “Now, 
I’d like to inspect your garden 
plot. Have you made prepara- 
tions for planting?” 

Twig’s eyes flashed. But he led 
them to the garden plot that me- 
andered beneath the mighty trees. 
A living fence marked its perime- 
ter, a protective encirclement of 
live roots. The dark soil showed 
signs of cultivation. 

But from the middle of the gar- 
den a massive root protruded, an 
encroaching woody monster that 
threatened to despoil the entire 
garden. 

Twig moaned. “It’s grown! 
Yesterday it was half this size! 
Last week it was only a thread!” 
Ritter frowned over the root. 
“What have you done to propiti- 
ate the trees? To persuade this 
root to withdraw?” 

Twig moaned. His voice quiv- 
ered as he detailed his chants, 
his hymns, his promises arid lois 
pleas. 



GALAXY 



Kert stared distastefully at the 
distorted face. 

The ranting ended abruptly. 
Twig stared at Kert as if seeing 
Him for the first time. His voice 
went deadly still. “I know what 
you would do, Bird. You would 
dig the root out and destroy it. 
Wouldn’t you?” 

Kert considered the root and 
tlie man. He nodded. “I would.” 

Twig screamed with rage. 
“You! You’re the reason I could 
not protect my Trees. My other- 
consciousness foresaw your com- 
ing. I was so overwrought, I fail- 
e<i in my duties. You are anti- 
Tree! Bird!” 

The root fence writhed at their 
feet. The giant root groaned and 
throbbed angrily. Ritter tugged 
Kert’s arm. Branches lashed 
down in fury as they loped 
tlirough the forest to the waiting 
hoverdish. 

“Bird! Your breed has always 
walked on the Tree — befouled 
the Tree — built wormy nests on 
the clean, pure Branches of the 
Tree! I foresaw your coming. 
Bird! Anti-Tree!” The madman 
flailed the ship with’ dirty fists. 

Kert’s hands trembled at the 
controls. The hoverdish rushed 
up powerfully. Twig ranted be- 
neath them, inciting the trees. 
Branches lashed out at tlie hov- 
erdisH, whipping at its sides. Birds 
rose in fugitive flocks. 

Then they were above the 
LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



clearing. Below, trees lashed and 
Twig danced in futile furry. 

Kert stared down in shock. 

Ritter’s hair stood in wild dis- - 
order. He fingered a rip in his 
velvet coverall. “I believe we 
made progress there today, Blue 
Hawk. I believe Twig has finally 
found a focus outside himself for 
his hatred.” 

Kert shook His head in disbe- 
lief. “He controls the trees.” 

Ritter nodded. “He controls the 
trees, and he is sick. But if he 
can focus his Hatred outward, 
perhaps He can discharge it with- 
out destroying himself. Perhaps 
someday I can even return him to 
the city. Perhaps.” 

Kert stared into the lashing 
trees. The voice of reason insisted 
that it isn’t possible. 

“It most certainly is possible,” 
Ritter said dryly. 

Kert eyed him sharply. I said 
nothing.” 

Ritter touched his medallion 
apologetically. “My trespass. But 
I Have no time for talk. I must 
prepare intensively for my next 
call.” Bowing his head, he with- 
drew into himself. 

TTis going left a perceptible 
emptiness in the cabin. The 
ship lurched violently in the air. 

Kert whipped to tlie controls. 
His eyes scanned the panel. 

Everything normal. Except — 
the ship rode nose high again. 

37 



Kert checked his compensatory 
settings. They hadn’t altered. Be- 
wildered, he reprogrammed the 
auto’s skim. The ship nosed down 
obediently. 

Frowning, he ran tests. They 
told him nothing, except that the 
ship carried an apparent over- 
load in the left rear. And there 
was no load at all in the left 
rear, no cargo, nothing except — 
Senior Special Person Ritter. 

Kert eyed Ritter in the mirror, 
perplexed. 

Presently Ritter raised his head. 
His face was drawn. “This will be 
my last call today. I will ask you 
to escort me again.” His eyes fo- 
cused inward. He issued direc- 
tions tensely. 

As they hovered over the clear- 
ing, Ritter performed his usual 
rituals witli particular intensity. 
Kert eyed the trees nervously, try- 
ing to see who, or what, waited. 

Then they stood on the forest 
floor. Face gray, body taut, Rit- 
ter moved into the trees. Kert 
followed. 

The trail was marked well. 
They approached a mossy boul- 
der that guarded a small cavern. 

The woman in the cavern 
raised her head. Her eyes were 
dim, her face withered. But her 
hair leapt about her head in 
flaming splendor, a brilliant mass 
of red. 

Ritter averted his eyes. Silent- 
ly he inventoried the contents of 
38 



the cavern. Wordlessly he pro- 
cessed requisition forms. 

Finally, with reluctance, He 
pocketed his pen. His dilated 
eyes fixed upon the woman, de- 
manding communication. 

She leaned forward eagerly. Her 
withered mouth worked. Her 
flaming hair writhed about her 
shoulders. 

Ritter shrank, his eyes fixed 
upon her brilliant hair. 

Finally the silent communica- 
tion was completed. Ritter turned 
away, a dazed expression on his 
blanched face. His knees buckled. 

Kert jumped to his side. 

“Ship,” Ritter gasped, cling- 
ing with purple talons. 

Kert helped him down the trail. 

They reached the clearing. Rit- 
ter slumped against the hoverdish, 
breathing harshly. Kert glanced 
uneasily down the trad. What had 
they fled? Just a withered hag 
with writhing hair? 

“No, no,” Ritter protested 
weakly. “I ran from my own 
weakness.” He pulled himself 
erect. “Never mind. We must loft 
for the city. We’ve given enough 
of ourselves today.” His face had 
regained color. 

They lofted. Perplexed, Kert 
eyed Ritter in the passenger- 
check mirror. Ritter seemed com- 
pletely recovered. He set aside his 
writing board to watch the forest 
pass below. 

Irritated, Kert noted that the 

GALAXY 



sHip’s attitude Had altered again. 
Tfie sKip nosed down, as if tlie 
heaviness in the left rear Had 
eased slightly. 

VII 

^^hey traversed tlie treetops, 
-*■ and the sun became a molten 
ball in the west. Clouds steamed 
across it in purple veils, then 
swept away. The sun flattened 
itself on the edge of the world, a 
bulging scarlet orb. 

Kert turned at the gasping sob 
from behind. Ritter was rigid in 
his seat, breathing harshly. His 
face was purple, congested. His 
hands clawed his throat. His eyes 
stared, like violet marbles, into 
tlie dusk-reddened sun. 

Kert abandoned the controls. 
He shook Ritter urgently, help- 
lessly. Swiftly he rifled Ritter’s 
pockets. The Senior Person car- 
ried no medication. 

Kert turned to the controls to 
transmit a Mayday. But then he 
turned back again, his eyes fast- 
ening upon the warning printed 
over Ritter’s heart. 

“Do not speak until spoken 
to. 

Never look down at my feet. 

Do not serve me with a 
gloved hand. 

Do not cause me to see the 
color red. 

Under penalty of law, swift 
and certain.” 

LIHLE BLUE HAWK 



Kert stared into the setting sun, 
as fiery red as the hair of the 
woman they had fled. With a 
harsh exclamation, he turned to 
the controls. Fumbling, he acti- 
vated the sun filter. 

The dome darkened quickly, as 
if a jug of ink had been spilled 
over it. The sun dulled to deep 
indigo. 

Ritter’s rigid body relaxed. His 
breathing eased. Intelligence re- 
turned to his eyes. He inclined 
his head to Kert in wordless 
gratitude. 

Exhausted, Kert slumped at the 
controls. When the sun set, he 
deactivated the filter. The dome 
cleared upon darkness. Trees 
stood below like dark sentinels. 
The city sparkled vividly on the 
horizon. 

“Now I will thank you formal- 
ly for your services today,” Rit- 
ter said later, when they Had 
stepped to the hangar floor. “I 
hope we can continue to function 
this effectively together. I’ll brief 
you on tomorrow’s routine in the 
morning before lift-off.” 

Ritter withdrew. The hangar 
was dim and deserted. Kert ca- 
ressed the hoverdisH wearily. He 
paced around it. Inspection re- 
vealed several small scratches in 
the paint. Otherwise the blue skin 
gleamed as brightly as it Had 
twelve hours before. 

In the locker room, Kert dis- 
carded his coverall. He showered 

39 



and zipped into a fresli coverall. 
He left the locker room in dark- 
ness. 

Standing at tEe door that led to 
the street, Ke felt a warning hint, 
an uneasiness, at tEe back of Eis 
mind. 

TEe hangar wasn’t empty. 

He turned, peered. 

A small, wEite-Ealoed figure 
was silhouetted in the doorway 
that led to the office corridors. 

Ritter. Kert relaxed, started to 
turn away. 

But Ritter beckoned. “Blue 
Hawk, a notion came to mind to- 
day as we reviewed your life here 
in the city.” 

“We didn’t — ” Kert bit off 
his protest Had Ee even tEougEt 
of Eis life in the city, in Ritter’s 
presence? 

No. 

Ritter’s eyes glowed compell- 
ingly. “I explored your mind, of 
course. A trespass, perKaps, since 
I am not officially your counsel. 
But I consider you one of my 
own, in a way. I brought you here. 
I abandoned you to tEe machin- 
ery of the Bureau. Now I’ve come 
across you again, and I find you 
in turmoil. Even now, in your 
mind, I can distinguish doubts 
and anxieties that have formed 
since we parted a few minutes 
ago. Having seen a few denizens 
of Rural America today, you be- 
gin to question the wisdom of 
visiting your bkthplace next week. 
40 



You have doubts that you can ac- 
cept wKat you may learn about 
your parentage and yourself.” 

K ert raised a Eand to shield 
himself. TEe hand fell, 
weighted by sudden Eeaviness, as 
if Eis blood had turned to molten 
steel. 

Ritter touched Eis medallion in 
apology. “I do trespass,” he mur- 
mured. 

TEe heaviness withdrew. Kert 
stared at Ritter. “You — you’re 
the Eeavy weight in tlie ship.” 
Ritter was startled. “IP” 

“You.” Kert hawked to the 
blue ship. He leapt to the con- 
trols, released the compensatory 
settings he Bad programmed ear- 
lier." The powerplant hummed 
alive. Deftly, Kert lifted the disH 
througE the port and into the 
night sky. 

A brief loft provided the an- 
swer. Without Ritter, the ship 
rode level. 

He set the dish down. He climb- 
ed out, puzzled but elated. 

Ritter stared down at his own 
small body, frowning. 

Kert narrowed his eyes at Rit- 
ter’s body. Surely Ritter’s weight 
could not effect the ship so odd- 
ly if that weight were purely 
physical. Kert formed an un- 
spoken question. Is your wei^t 
entirely physical? 

“I have always weighed nor- 
mally on scales.” Ritter clutched 

GAIAXY 




LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



41 



His medallion, “But evidently I 
have weight on other scales, 
weight I never guessed at. Per- 
haps only you and your ship can 
detect it.” He shook his head 
wearily. “There is the breath of 
a universe between knowing and 
understanding, Blue Hawk. I car- 
ry a cross every day — knowing 
too much, understanding too 
little.” 

Kert sighed, suddenly exhaust- 
ed, It was as if he received not 
only Ritter’s verbal communica- 
tion, but also a non-verbal one of 
doubt and weariness. 

The communication ended. 
Ritter said tentatively, “I want- 
ed to discuss your search for 
someone akin to yourself, some- 
one you could know and under- 
stand — who could know and 
understand you.” 

Kert nodded warily. He re- 
membered too vividly his furious 
adolescent search, his frustration. 

“I have considered all that care- 
fully before speaking,” Ritter said. 
He fingered His medallion 
thoughtfully. “Three Missions 
ago, I urged a certain young 
woman to migrate to the city 
from one of the smaller rural 
communities. I can’t promise any- 
thing, Blue Hawk. My evaluation 
of the situation may be completed 
askew. But perhaps — ” 

“Tell me!” Kert was startled by 
the sharp clatter of words. 

Ritter frowned. “Her name is 
42 



Dranna. Dranna the Crystal. I’m 
sure you’ve heard of the Flicker- 
ing Candle.” 

The Flickering Candle — one 
of the more elite trance shops. 
“I Have. I’ve never gone there.” 
Kert clutched his medallion tight- 

“I won’t describe Dranna’s art. 
People come from every precinct 
of the city to experience it. And 
that’s what it’s meant for — to 
be experienced. But despite suc- 
cess as an artist, Dranna is still 
at loose ends in our city, still un- 
focused in her personal life. I 
think perhaps the two of you 
could develop a mutual focus.” 

Kert frowned into the violet 
eyes, afraid to begin dreaming 
again. 

, “I’m a man of few words,” Rit- 
ter said finally, shrugging. “I’ve 
given you the name of the person, 
suggested where you look for her. 
I won’t mention the matter again.” 
Nodding, He withdrew. 

Kert stood immobile for a long 
time before leaving. 

They spent the week processing 
forest solitaries. Kert passed the 
time waiting near his ship, eyes, 
searching the trees uneasily. True, 
the forest solitaries were not so 
much different from the Special 
Persons He encountered daily on 
city streets. But here a single Per- 
son crept through deep shadow, 
shaggy, furtive, fearsome. And 
Kert shuddered. 



GALAXY 



At night, Kert slept deeply, 
too tired to think or to wonder 
about the girl named Dranna. 

T^riday, waking, He found his 
taut new skin Had eased 
comfortably over muscle and bone 
overnight. His blood coursed witH 
fresH vigor. He reached tKe Hang- 
ar early, wfiistling. 

The HoverdisH sat in a shaft 
of sunlight. Kert paced around it, 
trying to recreate the emotion He 
had felt Monday when the disH 
had gleamed with promise. Today 
it merely shone, a small blue 
disK freshly painted. 

Frowning, he spoke out his new 
name, Little Blue Hawk. The 
crystals, splintered to the floor 
colorlessly. The name had lost its 
evocative power. 

So it was that morning he fin- 
ally called on the magic bound 
up in the name Ritter had offer- 
ed : Dranna the Crystal. He spoke 
tKe name aloft, aground, now in 
shade, now in sunlight. Each time 
He discovered fresh promise in 
the delicately crystallized sylla- 
bles. 

Through the day, Ritter work- 
ed with frowning haste. At dusk 
He spoke. “I Have fallen behind 
schedule this week. And I must 
finish the solitaries before Mon- 
day.” 

“I can work into the night,” 
Kert offered. 

“And tomorrow?” 

LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



Kert nodded. “And Sunday.” 

Ritter smiled wearily. “No, 
friend. On the Seventh Day we 
rest.” 

It was past midnight when tHey 
returned to the hangar. They 
separated without speaking. Kert 
found himself alone in the street 
He had been too tired to shower 
or change. But the stimulus of 
city lights stirred him now. His 
crest rose with resurgent vigor. 
His feet covered pavement swift- 
ly- 

The Flickering Candle present- 
ed an austere front. At Kert’s ap- 
proach, the entry iris dilated. 
Kert stepped through — and 
a whining drone sawed into his 
skull. He staggered. He blinked 
at walls that burst alive in vivid 
patterns. The walls approached 
and receded dizzily, spun and 
whirled, attracted and rebelled. 

The hostess stepped from a 
screaming sunburst. She was 
small and pale. She wore a black 
velvet robe which overwhelmed 
her small body. “Which parlor, 
please?” 

“I — I came to see Dranna the 
Crystal.” 

“Cash or credit please?” 

Kert blinked stupidly. A pur- 
ple void opened on tlie near wall. 
He swayed toward it. 

“Do you have your general 
credit card, sir?” 

He escaped the void. He prof- 
fered his card. He lowered his 

43 



eyes discreetly to tiie floor. 

Underfoot, ^adow stripes rip- 
pled into a spiral. Kert staggered. 

WitH relief, Ke accepted fiis, 
credit card from tKe hostess. He 
followed Her into a dim corridor. 

Blackness draped the walls. 
Overhead lights grew dimmer, 
until the hostess padded silently 
into utter darkness. Kert touched 
velvet walls to steady himself. He 
moved, disembodied, into enfold- 
ing blackness. Claustrophobic 
bands tightened aroimd His chest. 

Finally a pale curtain rippled 
into sight. The hostess nodded 
Him through. 

The icy crystal glistened on a 
high, velvet-spread pedestal. Kert 
stared, unable to look away. 
Though the trance chamber was 
small, the crystal seemed an in- 
finite distance away. The still air 
of the chamber was frosty. 

Then the icy surface of the 
crystal veined with violet, with 
green, with yellow and orange red. 
And the crystal was huge, blaz- 
ing. Kert raised a hand against 
searing heat. The air crackled. 
Flames leapt from the walls. 

An eternity of flame, and the 
crystal veined with orange, with 
yellow, with green, receding. In a 
moment it was an icy seed on 
the velvety pedestal. Another mo- 
ment, and the pedestal was bare. 

Kert blinked in confusion, 
emerging from tire trance. He 
stared around the chamber, h'ard- 
44 



ly comprehending what he saw. 
The walls were hung with riieer 
rainbow panels that rippled 
Dazed patrons stretched on velvet 
chaises or sat on silken cusliions. 
Dizzily Kert eased himself down 
upon a cusliion. 

A high, wavering note vibrated 
through the chamber thinly; then 
taking on body, it materialized 
upon the pedestal in crystallic 
form. 

Before Kert could glance 
around, his consciousness was 
drawn into the delicately forming 
crystal. 

He floated inside the crystal, 
disembodied, observing the others, 
ranged around the chamber. He 
studied liis own body, abandoned 
on the silken cushion. For a mo- 
ment he peered through the rain- 
bow hangings at the small Person 
who sang. Her eyes were fixed 
on the ceiling. A rainbow of sound 
throbbed from Her throat. 

Then the crystal was stained 
with brilliant, blinding color. Kert 
rode away to the center of the 
universe. 

He awoke in the velvet corridor, 
His mind brimmed with incredi- 
ble memories. He traversed the 
corridor slowly, dazed. 

Only when his feet touched 
pavement did fie remember fie 
had visited the Candle with a pur- 
pose, to meet Dranne the Crys- 
tal. 

Frowning, he examined fiis 

GALAXY 



memory of tlie small Person tie- 
liind tlie rainbow curtain. iTHe 
memory was blm*red. Wlien He 
tried to focus it clearly, half a 
dozen otKer memories crowded 
His mind instead. 

Memories he Had never Had be- 
fore. 

Utterly confused, lie moved in- 
to the shadows of dawn. 

VIII 

He slept, his mind 
^ groped restlessly down 
strange corridors of memory, 
opening unfamiliar doors into 
alien rooms. Yet after two Hours 
he v/oke feeling alert and refresK- 
ed. 

Ritter, absorbed in his work, 
hardly spoke that day. And Kert, 
examining the familiar world with 
wondering eyes, Hardly noticed. 

Again lie traveled the midnight 
city to tKe Flickering Candle. He 
braved the hypnotic foyer, breez- 
ed dowTi the smothering black 
corridor. He sank to his cushion 
in the rainbow cKamber eagerly. 

Dranna’s song rang clear and 
High. Kert had no time for 
thought. His consciousness soar- 
ed swiftly, ecstatically to worlds 
he had never visited, worlds he 
remembered nevertlieless witK 
vivid joy. 

But occasionally His conscious- 
ness straggled back to reality. 
Befuddled, He stared at the dim 
LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



form befiind tKe pastel Hangings. 
Tliere was some purpose beHind 
His visit here. A purpose, surely, 
concerning the Person who sang 
there. 

But no — no. TEere was no one 
behind the curtain. TKere was no 
curtain. He Had come to soar. He 
had come to . yes. 

Near dawn, dazed. He moved 
through deserted streets, nagged 
by the feeling he Had left sc-me- 
thing undone. Something impcc- 
tant. 

But wliat? Finally, sighing. He 
turned back to tKe Candle. 

Tlie hostess smiled graciously. 
“We have just completed ©ur 
night of dreams, sir,” He said 
firmly. 

Outside he slumped in deep 
shadow. He frowned, trying to 
pinpoint the reason for his re- 
turn. 

A slight figure brushed past 
him. 

Realization flushed his face. 
Dranna the Crystal! He Had come 
to speak to her face to face. Per- 
son to Person. And now she 
moved away into shadow, a small 
figure in dark garments. He Isnew 
her instinctively. 

Kelt’s heart jumped wildly. Si- 
lently lie moved after Dranna 
the Crystal. 

Slie moved in shadow, avoid- 
ing the Ught puddles cast by over- 
head lamps. At first Her pace was 
weary. Then die glanced bdiind 

45 



nervously. She quickened. Stie 
glanced back again. SKe began to 
run. 

Kert fiesitated. Caution spoke 
— inaudibly. He would overtake 
her, explain himself to her, make 
her understand. He would — 

But she was gone. With a harsh 
cry, He scanned the pavement. 

She Had disappeared. 

A pale bubble bobbed up from 
tiie pavement, a dark figure at its 
center. 

Relieved, Kerrt watched the 
elevator mount the building. It 
hovered, then sank down empty. 
Kert stared at the building’s 
gray facade. His mind’s eye saw 
Branna the Crystal moving down 
dim hallways, groping for her 
key, appljdng it. 

When she was safe in her room, 
he turned away. 

T^our hours later he approached 
the building again, laden with 
doubt and a single nugget of gold. 
He had stared hard into His mir- 
ITM* that morning doubtfully. He 
had nothing to offer but Himself. 
And what was He? Frowning, he 
had considered His jut-beaked 
face, lined and pale; His stiff 
blue crest; His eyes, small, almost 
beady; the Harsh crystals of His 
speech. 

Leaving, he had selected a 
^gle bright nugget to offer Her. 
Clutclung it now, he stepped into 
the elebubble and rose to Her 
46 



level. Stiff-shouldered, He stalked 
the hall. He found the door that 
carried Her name. 

He drew a deep breath and 
jabbed tHe bell. 

The door slid slowly. A small^ 
shuttered visage raised pale eyeg 
to His. 

He clutched His nugget tightly, 
fighting his impulse to back away 
and run, never return. 

The face was small and still, 
with feathery brows. Her voice was 
a hoarse whisper. “What do you 
want?” 

“I am — Hawk TaHn,” lie 
managed harshly. “I’ve flown 
Spring Mission with Senior Per- 
son ’Drick Ritter this week. He 
offered me counsel: that I should 
make a meeting with you.” 

Her face opened then, quickly, 
radiantly. “You’ve visited New 
Bodel,” she whispered eagerly. 
“You’ve seen my father.” 

“I — no,” Kert admitted regret- 
fully. “We’ve visited only solita- 
ries.” Seeing her disappointment, 
he groped for words to explain 
himself, to open her face again. 
“Person Ritter suggested — He 
thought you might — I might — ” 
He faltered, defeated. 

Then He saw she didn’t listen. 
Instead she stared at the carpet 
between them. 

His words lay there, whole, un- 
broken. He stared, his eyes widen- 
ing. For these crystals shimmered 
with a tender fire never before 

GALAXY 



emliodied in words of his speak- 
ing, And somehow they expressed 
not what fie had said, but what he 
had wanted to say. 

. The words evaporated with a 
sweet, fiery shimmer. Dranna 
raised radiant eyes to his. “Please 
come in and — talk to me.” Her 
voice was hoarse, eager. 

The apartment was inexpres- 
sive, furnished with standard is- 
sue unembellished. There was no 
clutter, no litter, only tidy bare- 
ness. 

Her face reflected tfie same 
bareness, as if all her personality 
had been chamieled into crystals 
sung by night for strangers. 

“I — I just live here,” she 
whispered, explaining the empti- 
ness. 

He nodded. 

“But sit down!” she insisted. 
“You haven’t had breakfast. Nei- 
ther have I.” She laughed nerv- 
ously. “My throat is so sore. 
You do like milkshake?” She jab- 
bed at the serving board nervous- 
ly- 

“I do,” Kert agreed gallantly, 
although he didn’t. 

“For breakfast? Really?” 

It was midaftemoon before 
they ventured out. Kert had 
never walked the streets in 
company before. She was small at 
])is side, hoarse and gay. And he 
felt all the things a man feels on 
tire first day of love ; exhilaration, 
pride, apprehension. 

LITRE BLUE HAWK 



Their walk led them to tfie 
Hangar wfiere tfie blue Hoverdish 
waited. Kert stifled a flutter of 
nervousness. He led Her around 
tfie disfi, pointing out its features, 
detailing its performance. 

Finally fie had said everytlung. 
He studied her face intently. 

“It’s — very shiny,” she said 
finally, tentatively. She toocKed 
the blue skin lightly. 

Disappointed, he escorted Ker 
back to the street. < 

Her hand crept into his. His 
disappointment vanished. 

And at day’s end, meeting his 
reflection in her eyes, he knew fie 
was committed to a journey over 
lands uncharted. He realized she 
saw the same journey over lands 
charted. He realized she saw the 
same journey stretching before 
them. She lowered her eyes, col- 
oring. 

T Te arrived home hours later, 
the golden nugget forg^otten 
in his pocket. He paced his rooms 
restlessly, recalling every vA)rd, 
every gesture, every warmly glow- 
ing crystal. 

He slept little and rose early. 

“Today will be unsettling. Blue 
Hawk,” Ritter warned, when 'Qjey 
had lofted. “You’re accustomed 
to meeting the Special People di- 
luted by die city’s normal popu- 
lation. Today we’ll plunge down 
into an entire Special Communi- 
ty. These People are the most 

47 



Special of all. And their isola- 
tion from cultural cross-currents 
and their constant close associa- 
tion with one another tend to in- 
tensify their Specialness,” 

Kert nodded abstractedly. 

Ritter sighed. He withdrew 
counsel. 

Daydreaming, Kert settled the 
ship into the clearing — and 
emerged, into nightmare. 

A freaky band of supplicants 
crowded around them, whimper- 
ing, demanding, complaining. 

“IVe been traspassed! My 
neighbor — ” 

“The Bureau promised — ” 

“My house burned, and my 
children v/on’t — ” 

“I know my rights! I’m a citi- 
zen! I’m entitled — ” 

Kert clutched his medallion, 
trying to back away. A bony Hand 
clutched his arm. Fingers picked 
at his coverall. An inquisitive 
feeler invaded His mind, a mental 
threadroot groping insistently. 

He glared around. A two-head- 
ed man grinned puckishly; an ear- 
less crone glared; a child with too 
many fingers used them all to 
pull at Kert’s coverall. 

“Disperse, People,” Ritter com- 
manded. “I will not do business 
this way. I will hear you after 
I’ve made my rounds of inspec- 
tion.” 

The two-headed man swore an 
angry duet. The child dug all his 
nails into Kert’s arm and clung. 
43 



A pair of women tugged at Ritter. 

“Disperse!” Ritter’s voice lash- 
ed them. He disentangled liim- 
self. He presented His medallion 
in the gesture of command, his 
violet eyes blackening. 

The supplicants withdrew witli 
poor grace. 

Ritter’s face was stern. He 
strode the path to the community 
hall. “Now you understand my 
warning. Blue Hawk. This com- 
munity is one of the worst. To- 
day these people will focus all 
their cunning upon the two of us. 
This is their day to wrench every- 
thing they can from an uncaring 
world.” 

Kert clutched His composure 
desperately, assailed by the alien 
character of the community, by 
the fantastic insistence of each 
citizen upon his own Special 
rights. He shuddered as the wom- 
en presented their squalling, mal- 
formed infants with combative 
pride He cringed at the raucous; 
disputes aired for Ritter’s settle- 
ment. He fought nausea as Ritter 
inspected the insane, the cancerous 
and the senile in the infirmary, 
making notes as to which were 
to be lofted to medical centers, 
which were to have special equip- 
ment and supplies dropped in. 

Finally the long day ended. 
Dusk fell. Lord Mayor rumbled 
importantly, “We still have much 
to discuss. Person Ritter. My 
wives have your dinner Hot. 

GALAXY 



Ritter bowed deeply. “My re- 
grets, Your Honor. My hovermaii 
suffers a rare dietary anomaly. 
He requires special provisions 
within the hour. We must loft im- 
mediately.”” 

Lord Mayor eyed Kerf impa- 
tiently. “We’ve cracked com and 
millet seed in our granary. There 
is no reason I can’t provision 
a bird at my table.” 

Kelt’s crest flared indignantljr. 

“Blue Hawk is insectivorous, 
Your Honor,” Ritter murmured 
smoothly. “He’s completely de- 
pendent upon the city insect 
hatchery. My regrets.” 

Lord Mayor glared at Kert. 

From high, Kert stared down 
on the village. Tomorrow they 
would descend to another such 
place. And he would have to ac- 
knowledge that his origins lay 
there, that his parents had lived 
there, had been of there. 

Jaw set, he lifted his eyes from 
the place. 

Soon city lights beckoned. 
Hangar beacons flashed welcome. 
Mechanically, Kert settled the 
ship through the roofport. 

IX 

W hen they had disembarked, 
Ritter spoke. “If you don’t 
want to make the trip tomorrow, 
Blue Hawk, I will arrange a sub- 
stitute ho verm an.” 

Kert whirled, outraged by Rit- 
LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



ter’s 'trespass. “No! I will go.” 
The words smashed to the floor 
savagely. 

Ritter flinched. He staggered, 
gaping at his foot. 

Kert stared, uncomprehending, 
at the jagged black crystal that 
pierced Ritter’s foot. A gout of 
bright blood drenched his shoe. 

Kert stared. Then he heeded 
the harsh rhythm of Ritter’s 
breath, the unnatural rigidity of 
his body. Ritter’s eyes were ftsed 
upon the bright blood. His skin 
mottled. 

Kert leapt to the ship’s cabin, 
fetched first-aid supplies. He 
grasped the black crystal firmly, 
and it dissolved in his hand. 
Quickly he slapped a compress 
over the jagged wound. He layer- 
ed bandages over the bri^t 
blood to hide it from Ritter’s 
eyes. 

Ritter’s breathing eased. He 
shuddered. “My foot,” he mut- 
tered. 

“I’ll get a medic when the blood 
has stopped.” Kert lifted the 
compress, to examine the wound. 

Fiercely, Ritter wrenched his 
foot from Kerfs grip. He stag- 
gered backward. His eyes glit- 
tered. “You looked at my foot” 

“You’re bleeding! You — ” 

Ritter crouched, clutching the 
bleeding foot. He spoke from the 
far side of madness. “You looked 
at my foot.” 

Paralyzed, Kert groped for rca- 

49 



son. Finally; Ke faltered, “I — ■ ac- 
knowledge my trespass.” He pre- 
sented liis medallion in tKe ges- 
ture of contrition. 

Gradually sanity returned to 
Ritter’s eyes. He glanced down 
at Hie injured foot, tKen away 
quickly. “Give me bandages.” 

Kert obeyed. 

When Ritter had bound Kis 
foot. He clambered aboard the 
EoverdisH. They dropped tKrougH 
tKe emergency port of a nearby 
clinic. An attendant Hurried for- 
ward. 

“I will expect you at Hie usual 
time tomorrow,” Ritter said 
tersely, disembarking. “Unless 
you notify me otHerwise.” 

Released, Kert lofted higH 
above tKe city. Automatically, 
Kis Hands guided tKe ship to tKe 
mountain sHelf. He left tKe sHip. 
He stood alone in icy starlight, 
disturbed. Occasionally Ke had 
nicked his own throat, cut Kis own 
lip upon a word materialized too 
sharply. But Ke had never given 
injury to another. 

He stared out into tKe nigKt, 
considering tKe strange, tender 
fire of the crystals he Kad spoken 
to Dranna yesterday, considering 
today’s jagged black crystal of 
anger. And Ke realized that some 
power was unfolding within Kim, 
witKout his consent. Beyond His 
control. 

WHen tKe wind Kad numbed 
Kim beyond thought, he lifted off 
50 



the mountainside. That nigiit Ke 
slept in tKe ship, head upon tKe 
control board. 

Tuesday morning Ke showered 
in tKe locker room. Freshly cov- 
eralled, he approached tKe ship. 

Ritter waited, his face pale, 
his features set. “I see you did 
arrive today.” 

Kert carefully avoided glancing 
down. “I did.” ” 

“TKen we will proceed as usu- 
al.” Ritter turned away, limping, 
Kert’s heart pounded thunder- 
ously. He was committed now. 
Only a barrier of time stood be- 
tween himself and Kis place of 
birth, himself and self-knowledge. 

TKey lofted high. The time bar- 
rier melted. The sun zipped 
through its early morning arc, 
and they hung above a canyon- 
side clearing. 

A n insistent voice crackled from 
their radio. “Relinquish 
control! Ship, relinquish con- 
trol. Release your auto-settings. 
I control air currents over this 
community.” 

Kert stared down. This was tKe 
place, this scatter of rude struc- 
tures on tKe east rim of a deep 
canyon, this stand of trees, Hiis — 
“Relinquish immediately! You 
are creating turbulence!” 

Kert’s eyes, picked out a KigH 
fence bounding and clearing, a 
heap of rusty equipment piled 
just outside the fence and an an- 

GALAXY 



gry figure tiiat glared up aC lurfli 

“Relinquish,” Ritter instructed. 
“Otherwise he’ll bring us down 
without consent.” 

Reluctantly, Kert released His 
auto-settings. He lifted his hands 
from the controls. 

The ship dropped abruptly. It 
smacked ground with a jolt. 

The fence shut them in. “Iden- 
tify yourselves,” the radio de- 
manded. 

“Bureau ship on Spring Mis- 
sion,” Kert snapped. He jabbed 
the hatch release. 

The hatch did not slide. 

Ritter spoke briskly. “I am 
Senior Special Person Ritter. My 
hoverman is Special Person Hawk 
Tahn, a native of your commun- 
ity. Release us.” 

The hatch slid. 

The small, hostile Person who 
unlocked the gate, eyed Kert 
darkly. “I control air currents 
here. I won’t take trouble from 
you, Tahn.” 

Kert bit back anger. He stared 
aroimd the clearing, and his crest 
stiffened. The People of the com- 
munity were gathered. And there 
was no welcome in the eyes that 
met his. 

Then a small, plump man bus- 
tled through the dour crowd, his 
hand extended. “Well, I welcome 
you. Blue Hawk,” he declared. 
He had a dumpling face, small 
eyes that snapped with intelli- 
gence, a mouth that smiled by 

LIHLE BLUE HAWK 



turning dowh. “You’ve come to 
see the rim. And I appoint my- 
self to escort you. I’m the only- 
one who will do.” 

Kert studied the imsmiling 
faces that composed the land- 
scape. No eye sdelded to his stare. 
He turned to Ritter. 

“I can conduct business well 
enough without you. Teller will 
bring you to the town hall when 
you’ve seen everything.” 

Stiff-shouldered, Kert followed 
the plump man. A score of un- 
friendly eyes nettled the back of 
his neck. 

They left the clearing, angling 
behind the rustic community. “I 
am called Teller,” the plump man 
declared, “because I tell. Any- 
thing. Everything. Anytime, Any- 
place.” 

Kert eyed him narrowly, fol- 
lowing. 

Their path took them through 
the back edge of the deserted vil- 
lage. As they picked their way. 
Teller began to tell. 

He wove the entire community, 
past and present, into his narra- 
tive. He told of the earliest set- 
tlers, those fleeing freaks. And he 
told of present-day inhabitants. 
He told of children and adults 
and elders, some dead, some just 
born. Every stick, every pebble 
was woven into the tale. Every 
tree had shadowed some tryst. 
Every boulder had been the site 
of some agonizing decision. 



51 



T^inally, into tKe narrative, Blue- 
A bird was born, wingless. SKe 
Hatched in a crude nest-house — ■ 
there, high in that dying oak. A 
few beams of the nest still stood, 
rotting in leafy shadow. Her fa- 
ther was a shy hav/k who left his 
nest only by night. Her mother 
was a practical little Person, 
feathered like a sparrow. 

The child? She was glistening 
blue feathers and an impatient 
song, waiting for her wings to 
grow. 

Through childhood she sang 
her restive tale about the day 
she would fly away from all, free. 
In adolesence, stUl wingless, she 
revolted. She made herself hate- 
ful. Then suddenly she was adult, 
still bound down. Disillusioned, 
she withdrew into an inner sky, a 
sky where she soared free and 
high. Haughtily, she ignored the 
coimsel of the elders. Arrogantly, 
she refused to concern herself 
with earthly matters. Her destiny 
lay above. 

Then came the strange, angry 
affair with that earthbound man, 
Rad Tahn. He was a sullen 
blunt-spoken man, an angry man 
who lived from brawl to brawl. 

They nested down together. 
Presently it was apparent there 
would be a third party to the af- 
fair. Despite censure, they de- 
clined to sanctify their union. 
The young Hawk was bom with a 
despairing cry, 

52 



His grandmother took custody 
immediately. It wasn’t until she 
fell dead a year later that he 
come into his mother’s care. 

For a few days. Because that 
week a fierce battle erapted be- 
tween the mismatched mates, a 
struggle more savage than any 
otiier. Possessed with fury, Blue- 
bird uttered a piercing cry and 
plunged from their low nest. 
She rushed through the village, a 
vengeful blue flash, to the rocky 
rim of the canyon. 

To this spot. Here she paused 
for an instant, wingless, arms 
spread. Here she uttered that last 
fierce cry and — 

Well, some say they saw her 
swoop up into the clouds. 

Others say otherwise. They say 
the brilliant blue blossoms that 
color the floor of the canyon ev- 
ery spring were seeded by her 
broken body. Certainly they nev- 
er bloomed there before. 

Shaking free of the strange nar- 
rative, Kelt stared down. For be- 
low, in the dark, jagged rocks, 
bloomed a faint patch of blue. 

He stood in, the sunlight, staring 
down. Without thought, without 
effort. He Had absorbed the story 
of this village, these people. He 
had become intimately informed 
of his ancestry and his origins al- 
most magically, as if a richly em- 
broidered emotional tapestry had 
been transferred intact from Tell- 
er’s mind to his own.

Kert stared down. Then h’e 
raised His eyes to Teller, tKat 
mundane man suddenly become 
msrsterious, witH Ws strange gift 
of communication. “Wfiat do you 
think happened?” Kert demand- 
ed. 

Teller smiled thougfitfully. “I 
believe she lives on tire wind, on 
the wing. I believe she’s a bird 
somewhere.” 

Nodding, Kert stared into the 
vastness of the sky. He heard its 
call clearly now. It commanded 
him, drew him. He felt his body 
lighten. 

Teller said gently, “I’ll walk 
down to the hall now. I believe 
you can find your way alone. 
Hawk.” 

“I can,” Kert answered. 

He gazed upward. A floating, 
feather-lightness possessed him. 
He raised His arms and rose up 
lightly, freed. When He glanced 
down, the forest was far below. 

Kert spread his arms, and the 
sky opened. Giddily, he rose until 
the air was thin and cold. He 
swooped down, a fierce, exulting 
cry breaking from his lips. 

He swooped over the forest, 
hurtled low over an icy brook, 
then cleaved his way back to the 
canyon. He winged into its 
depths, hovering over the place 
where blue blossoms grew in 
feathery clusters. 

He was light, free, a bird awing. 

And it was all wrong. 

LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



TJ'rowning, He settled to tHe can- 
yon’s rim. His body took on 
weight. 

All wrong. There had Heen ex- 
hilaration and joy. But he had no 
desire to swoop away into the 
clouds. He had no wish to Hawk 
over the countryside in lonely 
splendor. He was a man, not bird. 

He was a man — with a ma- 
chine. WitH a fierce cry, obsessed, 
he hurtled through the trees, down 
the path to the clearing where 
his ship waited. With an angry 
cry he caught at the mesh of the 
fence that separated them. Scram- 
bling, he mounted it. 

A fierce squawk erupted. Wiry 
arms caught at him. “I control 
air currents Here! You can’t loft 
without my consent.” 

Dragged down, Kert struggled 
furiously. “I lift when I want!” 

“I Have special dispensation! I 
have controlled this air seventeen 
years. I won’t alllow — ” 

Kert struggled free. “You will 
allow!” he spat. The words were 
jagged, black. Without thinking, 
Kert scooped one up in his Hand. 
He clutched it, a black crystal- 
line dagger. 

Cursing, the small man launch- 
ed himself at Kert. 

The glittering tip of the crystal 
dagger nipped leathery flesli. 

The small man jerked away. 
A single droplet of blood popped 

53 



from his tEroat. His eyes bulged. 
He flattened Himself against the 
fence, clutching his tliroat. 

Kert stared at him, uncompre- 
Eending. TKen Eis hand registered 
the Keft of the crystalline weap- 
on. He stared down at it, his jaw 
dropping. 

“Don’t come near me! I’ll let 
you loft I’ll open the gates. 
I’ll — ” 

Kert’s fingers numbed witH 
sEock. The crystal dropped. 

By the time the crowd gatfier- 
ed near, tHe crystal was dark dew 
* at Kert’s feet. Kert sared numbly. 

By the time the crowd bathered 

The dark dew evaporated. Kert 
turned, dazed. His eyes met Tell- 
er’s. Groping, Ee put the question 
he Hadn’t tHought to ask before, 
tEe question Ee now recognized 
to be crucial. “Where is my fa- 
ther?” That surly, blunt-spoken 
man. 

A hulking Hirsute beast, more 
bear than man, rumbled ponder- 
ously. “It was my brother Ee mur- 
dered, Rad TaEn. His body is in 
tHe ground, with my arrow in Eis 
Heart.” His black eyes glittered 
defiantly. “And I saw the thing 
he killed with'. Rad Tahn. I was 
there. I saw.” 

Kert turned back to Teller. 

Teller sighed. “I’ll lead you.” 

T He marker was primitive, 
crudely chiseled. 

“Here lies Rad TaEn, 



WEo in tEe 37tS year 
Of his life 

Foully battered and 
murdered 
Karter Karter, 

With a blimt word 
Of his own speaking.” 

Kert knelt. He stared at tHe 
marker. Finally, rising, he nodded 
Eis understanding. 

Teller spoke quietly. “This 
deatH — Rad Tahn’s — marked 
a turning point in our ways. Be- 
fore, we lived under natural law. 
If a man killed, he was given to 
his victim’s kin. But after Rad 
Tahn was done to death, contro- 
versy arose. Was it possible to 
beat a man to death with a blunt- 
ly spoken word? Could any man, 
however Special, speak a murder- 
er’s club? Why did no one but 
Krick Karter see the alleged 
club?” 

“I did see it!” Krick Karter 
rumbled. “I stood there beside 
my brother when he tried to col- 
lect the debt Rad Tahn owed him. 
I saw Rad Tahn curse out that — 
that glassy dug and batter my 
brother with it. And I put my ar- 
row in Rad Tahn’s Heart for it.” 

Teller spoke reasonably. “But 
Person Ritter was not here to 
look into Rad Tahn’s mind and 
tell us what guilt was there. We 
have only your word. No one else 
saw the club.” 

“It melted! Like a club of ice. 
It melted on the floor.” 



54 



GALAXY 



“No one saw a puddle, Karter. 
It was a draught year, hot and 
dry. No one was spilling water 
around that summer. Any one of 
us would have noticed a puddle 
— and no one did.” 

Angrily, Krick Karter glared at 
them all. HarsK fur rose at the 
back of his neck. He lumbered 
away. 

The man wfio controlled air 
currents declared passionately, 
“I always thought Krick Karter 
was drunk that night. Now I know 
I have done him trespass.” He 
scurried after Karter. 

“Now what d’ye make of that?” 
an elderly man mused. 

Kert frowned, at the focus of 
all eyes. Were they blind? Hadn’t 
they seen the dagger in his hand? 
Hadn’t they seen the black dew 
in the grass? 

“Even here People don’t always 
accept the improbable,” Ritter 
murmured. “What they saw — or 
believe they saw — was a strug- 
gle between two men. One of them 
panicked and broke away.” 

Kert studied the bemused faces. 
Sighing, he nodded. 

Teller rose. He let high grass 
obscure Rad Tahn’s gravestone. 
“Now I’ve told you everything. 
Blue Hawk. More than I intended 
to tell.” He smiled regretfully. 

Solemnly, Kert made his 
thanks to Teller. The villagers 
withdrew, gossiping through the 
graveyard. 

LITTLE BLUE HAWK 



Ritter’s eyes slanted thought- 
fully. “May I count on you to loft 
me at sundown?” 

Kert spoke absently, staring 
down into the grass. “You may.” 

ert stood alone. He returned 
to the clearing slowly, lost in 
thought. 

The ship hfted lightly, sweetly, 
freed at last from gravity. 

For an hour they rode the wind, 
sweeping the sky aimlessly. Kert 
considered the facts he needed to 
consider, thought the thoughts 
he needed to think. 

Then a towering cloud forma- 
tion reared in the west. The ship 
cut through the sky and soared 
to the cloud’s lofty top. Spiral- 
ling, they spun down through the 
cloudy tower. The ship’s gleaming 
blue skin became Kelt’s own. 
Cloudy mist chilled his flesh, 
frosted his crest. 

They dropped out of the 
cloudy tower into brilliant sun- 
light. The earth spread below, 
sparkling and serene. The time 
for thought was past. Now was 
the time to be. 

Kert threw back his head. An 
exultant cry exploded up his 
throat. It was the cry of a hawk 
never before seen over the land, 
not a harsh cry, not a cutting cry 
— but a sparkle of diamonds, 
showering to earth, brilliant witlr 
promise and joy.

THE OPEN SECRETS 

by LARRY EISENBERG 



The computer's secrets were guarded 
so that only a trillion-fo-one chance 
could disclose them . and one did ! 



greatest error was in let- 
ting DuckwortK into tKe 
computer room. But it Had never 
occurred to me tKat He would ask 
so many questions and provoke 
me into trying tHe forbidden. 

“The computer looks migHty 
small to me,” He said. “Where are 
the memory banks for data stor- 
age?” 

“Most of our memory is not 
here,” I said. “We store all long 
term data and our programs in 
the Federal Computer Memory 
Bank. We have an access termin- 
al that permits us to retrieve 
whatever information we want.” 
“Suppose another customer 
wants to reach the bank at the 
same time?” 



“There’s a time-sKaring ar- 
rangement,” I said patiently. “We 
fit our requests into the time gaiM 
not used by other people and 
they do the same.” 

Duckworth stood there, be- 
mused. 

“The Bank must have lots of 
room,” he said. 

I smiled. “The FCMB has the 
largest memory capacity of any 
such unit on Earth. It stores the 
files of every Federal agency, 
bank records, department store 
inventories, university research 
notes, practically everything that 
maeks this country tick.” 

Duckworth seemed perturbed. 
“How do you insure privacy?” 
“By coding,” I said. “A two- 



56 



word signature is required to gain 
entry to a section of the memory 
bank. Each word is made up of 
foTxrteen bits, making a total of 
twenty-eight bits.” 

“Then the odds are about one 
hundred million to one against 
a chance guess.” 

“True,” I said, “but those are 
mighty big odds.” 

“What if I entered someone 
else’s code by mistake?” said 
Duckworth. 

“Nothing would happen. A 
countersign code is necessary 
which requires another fourteen 
bits. That ups the odds by an- 
other ten thousand to one.” 

Duckworth shook his Head. 

“I still don’t like it,” he said. 

I was annoyed by his obstinacy 
and responded by behaving child- 
ishly. 

“Here,” I said. “I’ll let you en- 
ter any two fourteen-bit words. 
Go ahead and set the switches 
in some random sequence of ones 
and zeroes.” 

Duckworth seemed startled at 
my suggestion but he complied. 
I entered his sequence into the 
accumulator. The Confirm regis- 
ter lit up. 

“What does that mean?” said 
Duckworth. 

I bit my lip. 

“Oddly enough you stum- 
bled on somebody’s code. But 
now you have to choose another 
fourteen bits. You’ll get an in- 

THE OPEN SECRETS 



correct confirm and have to start 
all over again. As you can see, 
the probability of anything going 
wrong is fantastically tiny.” 

“But Unite,” said Duckworth 
and He entered another fourteen 
bits at random. 

Tt was at this point that the out- 
put printer started up and 
did not stop until it was too late. 
For a moment I was too sturmed 
to move, but Duckworth wasn’t 
inhibited at all. He went over to 
the printer and began to scan 
the neat rows of letters. His brow 
furrowed. His eyes closed, then he 
began to chuckle quietly. Finally, 
he roared with laughter. 

“What is it?” I said. 

I became terribly frightened 
and I knew that I didn’t want to 
read the printed out material. 

“What is it?” I repeated, with 
less conviction. 

“You won’t believe it,” said 
Duckworth, “but we’ve got the 
confidential files of the Federal 
Investigation Bureau.” 

“The FIB?” I said. I felt tire 
blood draining out of my head. 
“Turn off the damned printer!” 
I yelled. 

Duckworth restrained me. 

“Don’t get hsrsterical,” he said. 
“It’s fun to read.” 

As I said, I was terribly fr^ht- 
ened, but even more curious. So 
I decided to let the printer run 
for just another minute or two. 

57 



It was to prove my undoing. 

“Look at ttis!” said Duck- 
wortB. “It’s about the President.” 

I looked at that and countless 
otHer forbidden accumulations of 
Hearsay and unconfirmed data 
wfiicS had been painstakingly put 
together over tfie years. 

“I can’t believe tKis stuff,” I 
said* 

“I can,” said DuckwortH. “It 
confirms what I always suspect- 
ed.” 

About a Half Hour later, Duck- 
wortH found some items concern- 
ing Himself and he flew into a 
rage. 

“AH lies,” He cried, “everytfiing 
Here. My trip to Wadam was 
purely to do ^emistry. I Hardly 
ever saw tKe Nazir’s harem.” 

I tried to see wHat was being 
printed out but DuckwortH kept 
me at bay witH one knobby hand. 
Suddenly He stopped reading and 
looked directly at me. 

“Do you realize wfiat a pow- 
erful blackmailing weapon is in 
our Hands?” He said. 

“You don’t really mean tKat, 
do you?” 

“I damn well do,” said Duck- 
worth, “All of this dirt could turn 
tHe country upside down.” TKen 
he sHrugged. “But I’m a cfiemist, 
not a blackmailer. Still, if we ever 
spilled tHese beans, there’d be Kell 
to pay.” 

“Turn it off,” I said. “We’ve 
seen enough.” 

58 



At that point I received ah 
urgent call from President Hin- 
kle’s secretary. The president was 
ready to discuss tKe computer 
budget for tKe following fiscal 
year. 

“I must leave at once,” I said* 
“So I want you to turn off tKe 
printer. Hit the Clear Register 
button and get the Kell out of 
Here. And take all of tKat copy 
witK you and burn it.” 

“You can trust me,” said Duck- 
wordi and like a fool I did. 

When I came back, two Hours 
later, one of the graduate stu- 
dents was at the console. We nod- 
ded to one another. I surrepti- 
tiously went tKrougK the waste 
basket behind tKe printer and all 
of tKe lively stuff was gone. I 
sighed in gratitude and went 
Home. But all that night, ideas 
flitted through my mind, fan- 
tasies of what I could have done 
with all that dirt. 

'^Ke first sigfit of two strangers, 
the following afternoon, knot- 
ted my stomach again. Gum- 
shoes look the same no matter 
wKat agency they represent. And 
these two, I surmised, were 
FIB’ers. I was right, of course. 

They did not get directly to 
tKe point. 

“I’d like to see your computer 
time scHedule for yesterday,” said 
the smoother of tKe pair after 
flashing his identity card. His 

GALAXY 



name, if: said, was Dunnigan. 

“WTSy?” I said, trying to figure 
out wHat to do next. THe time 
schedule would show that Duck- 
wortfi was slotted in for tfie hours 
to two to four P.M. 

Dunnigan’s companion, an ap- 
ple- cheeked bumpkin with pro- 
truding starched linen cuffs, 
smiled at me amiably. What was 
I to do? I apologized later to 
Duckworth, but he refused to 
listen to me. 

“You could Have substituted 
another time sheet,” he said petu- 
lantly, “one with the time slot 
left blank.” 

Of course it was easy enough 
for him to say. But they’d have 
discovered the truth, sooner or 
later. We all went directly to 
Duckworth’s laboratory in the 
Chemistry building. At first he 
denied everything. 

“Look,” said Dunnigan at last, 
“we know that our files in the 
Memory Bank were searched for 
an hour and a half during the 
time you were at the console. We 
also know that the Interrogate 
command came from this uni- 
versity’s computer. Give us back 
the printed out data, tell us How 
you discovered our code, and we 
will recommend that you get off 
lightly.” 

“You won’t believe this,” said 
Duckworth. “I don’t know your 
code. My entries were purely by 
chance.” 

THE OPEN SECRETS 



For tfie first time Ehumigan 
smiled and fiis companion slap- 
ped at his tfiigfi in hi^ fiumor< 
“Tfie cfiance of doing that,” said 
Dunnigan “are about one in a 
trillion.” 

Duckworth smiled sweetly. 

“But there is that one chance, 
isn’t there?” 

“Where is the printed data?” 
said Dunnigan. 

“I burned all of it,” said Duck- 
worth. 

They didn’t believe any of his 
story. I confirmed the fact that he 
had hit on the code by pure luck. 
That simply made me an ac- 
complice and I found myself in 
a cell adjoining that of Duck- 
wortli’s. Because of the severity 
of the charges, we were both Held 
without bail. At first there was 
not much talk between us. I Hated 
his guts for getting me into this 
stupid mess. And he kept hum- 
ming merrily to himself. 

“Shut up,” I finally snarled. 

Duckworth slipped his Hand 
out of his cell and worked it be- 
tween my bars, where his fingers 
began to play against my spine. 
I pushed his hand away, angrily, 
but lie was a persistent devil and 
resumed the gentle tattoo. Then 
it dawned on me that he might 
be tapping out a message in 
Morse code. I focused my brain 
on sequences of long and short 
taps. 

“We’re undoubtedly being lis- 

59 



tened to,” he said abruptly. 

“Lay off the polysyllabic 
words,” I said softly. “You’ll ruin 
my spine.” 

Duckworth growled but Ke con- 
tinued to tap out his message. 

“I really did burn the data,” 
he tapped, “but I stored the juici- 
est stuff in a dandy hiding place. 
And I’ll never give up until my 
conditions are met.” 

“What conditions?” I began. 

At that point three guards 
marched over, opened my cell 
door, and moved me out to anoth- 
er cell block. 

“Is this nearer to the Chair?” 
I said weakly. 

T was now all alone and I won- 
dered what hideous torments 
lay ahead for the pair of us. But 
tlie expectation proved worse than 
the outcome. I was questioned 
again and again under Hot lights 
but I kept silent. Aside from the 
abominable prison fare and a con 
in a nearby cell who kept play- 
ing “I Believe” on His harmonica, 
nothing untoward happened. In 
fact, three weeks later I was un- 
conditionally released and so was 
Duckworth. 

We shared a cab back to the 
University campus. I started to 
speak but Duckworth silenced 
me and nodded to tlie driver. As 
we left the cab, Duckworth took 
hold of my shoulder and pushed 
me along the tree-lined walk, si- 
60 



multaneously muttering in my 
ear. 

“Just hold tight and say noth- 
ing. We’ve got them by the fuzz.” 
We went first to President 
Hinkle’s office where our greeting 
was less than warm. He looked 
up at us, his great mottled nose 
aflame. 

“You’ve put the university under 
a cloud and God knows what else, 
for the moment your suspensions 
are lifted. I’m allowing you to re- 
sume your duties pending the out- 
come of this investigation but I 
urge you both to come clean witli 
the authorities.” 

“We already have,” said Duck- 
worth. I nodded. I have no choice 
but to go along with my friend. 
I went back to the computer to 
resume my rightful duties as chief 
programmer. But things weren’t 
quite so simple. There was, for 
example, the succulent coed who 
asked for my help in debugging 
her first Fortran program. With 
true dedication I arrived at her 
dormitory room one Saturday 
evening, after Hours, to assist Her, 
She was friendly, even warm, but 
after biting my ear lobe, she whis- 
pered, “What are you going to 
do with the dirt you dredged up?” 
I leaped away as though stung 
by an adder. Her eyes were wide, 
ingenuous, innocent. 

“I’m getting the Hell out of 
here,” I cried, and I did. 

The pressure become even more 
GALAXY 



intense as time went on. TKe suc- 
cession of flatfooted middle-aged 
freshmen, replete with beards, 
wHo kept following me about, 
began to prey on my nerves. 
Whenever I approached Duck- 
worth our conversation inevitably 
went right to the weather, the 
Ivy blight, and Kow despicable 
it was to keep the facility pay 
scale at a C minus rating. Duck- 
worth would talk about nothing 
else. 

Weeks went by, months, and 
I began to go to pieces. Absent- 
mindedly I erased two master 
tapes, plugged a replacement 
card into the wrong socket, and 
burned out the power supply of 
the computer despite six heavy 
fuses. In addition I snarled at 
every student who came within 
six paces of me. 

I could bear it no longer. I 
turned off the computer, card 
readers, tape decks, even the air 
conditioner, put up a large hand- 
letter sign which read, MY LIPS 
ARE SEALED, and marched 
Over to Duckworth’s lab. He 
greeted me with the usual weath- 
er gambit, but I would have none 
of it. I v/ent right to his refriger- 
ator, grabbed a few eggs and 
dropped them into a breaker of 
water to boil. 

“You and I are going out into 
the woods for a picnic,” I said, 
and my meaning was clear. 

His face had turned ashen and 
THE OPEN SECRETS 



he dropped the test tube he’d been 
examining. Then he sat down, 
loosened his collar, sucked , in 
air and stared at the beaker of 
boiling eggs. 

( 6"fT^here’s your courage, 
Duckworth?” I cried 
recklessly. “We’re free men in a 
free land. God damn it, why can’t 
we go for a private talk if we 
went to?” 

He found his voice but it was 
faint and gravelly. His eyes had 
the luster of two lead bullets. 

“No reason why not,” he said. 

Then he nodded to President 
Hinkle who Had stalked into the 
lab, followed by Dunnigan and 
his apple-cheeked companion. 
Hinkle was .mopping His brow 
with with a monogrammed hand- 
kerchief. 

“Duckworth,” he pleaded, “our 
fate is in your Hands. Unless you 
tell these gentlemen where the 
stuff is, all funding monies for 
our grants will be denied the 
University.” 

“I burned the printout rec- 
ords,” said Duckworth. 

“That’s true,” said Dunnigan. 
“We found the ashes and the FIB 
lab reconstructed part of the 
printout. But we think you made 
a copy. We went through your 
notebook and found a peculiar 
kind of code notation.” 

President Hinkle put His arm 
on Duckworth’s shoulder. 



61 



“Tell him the trutli,” He said. 
“If not for the university, then 
for Science.” 

Duckworth’s eyes were moist. 

“President Hinkle,” he said, 
“when I was a junior faculty 
member, we thought of you as the 
grand old man. It was your in- 
spired thought to provide first 
year chemistry kits for fresHmen. 
If I did it for anyone, I’d do it 
for you. But I want something 
in return from the government.” 

“I’ll listen,” said Dunnigan, 
“but I can’t make any promises.” 

“I want the confidential files 
of the FIB erased,” said Duck- 
wortli. “Judging by wKat it says 
about me, there isn’t a single true 
statement in it.” 

Dunnigan’s lips paled and his 
apple-cheeked companion almost 
swallowed his gum. For a while 
Dunnigan said nothing, then he 
cleared his throat and said, “The 
files were erased. It happened 
when you put that interrogate 
command to our memory bank. 
That’s why we must have your 
copy.” 

“Fair enough,” said Duckworth. 
“Do you know anything about 
my work?” 

“Your macromolecule? Who 
doesn’t?” I said. 

“I don’t,” said Dunnigan. 

“It involves a double helical 
molecule similar to that of DNA. 
The enormous coding possibili- 
ties rival that of the genetic code.” 
62 



President Hinkle gasped. 

“You hid the information by 
coding it into one of your macro - 
molecules?” 

Duckworth beamed. 
“Precisely,” he said. “I then put 
it into an egg, one of the group 
which my friend here just hard- 
boiled for lunch.” 

“That’s why you look ill,” I 
cried. 

“I was ill,” said Duckworth. 
Then he reached into the beak- 
er. “The brown egg has the file 
information,” He said. He hand- 
ed it to Dunnigan. “Have one of 
your genetic experts check it 
against the code in my notebook.” 
“By the way,” added Duck- 
worth, “I have a fantastic mem- 
ory. For example I can give you 
all the details on Senator Tliig- 
point, chairman of the Commit- 
tee on Limited Wars.” 

He tore a page out of his note- 
book and using longhand, pro- 
ceeded to fill both sides of the 
page with a nicely turned bit of 
penmanship. Closing with a flour- 
ish, he blew gently on the wet ink 
and handed the sheet to Dunni- 
gan , 

I could see Dunnigan’s lips turn 
blue as his eyes scanned the sheet. 
At the end, he folded the paper 
with trembling fingers, saying 
only that he’d take it up with his 
superiors. 

“Tell ’em there’s more where 
that came from,” said Duck- 

GALAXY 



worth:. He turned to me and 
slapped me on the back, jocular- 
ly. “Now let’s have that picnic,” 
he said. 

Tn the open field near a rippling 
-*• brook, with his transistor ra- 
dio blasting at full volume, he 
handed me another egg. I was re- 
luctant to eat it. What if it too, 
held vital state secrets? 

“Don’t be a fool,” said Duck- 
worth. “I didn’t have time to 
make a second copy.” 

“Then why did you give them 
the coded egg?” 

“Why not?” said Duckworth. 
“The hard boiling scrambled the 
code.” 

I was elated. The jailing, the 
hot lights, even the treacherous 
coed had all been worth the game. 
Then an errant thought struck 
me. 

“Was there an3rthing in the 
printout about President Hin- 
kle?” I said wistfully. 

“Don’t terhpt me,” said Duck- 
Vi^orth. 

And opening a can of worms, 
we baited two fislihooks and sat 
down to an afternoon of delight- 
ful trout fishing.

TERRY CARR and ALEXEI PANSHIN 



No man can ever build 
another man's dream. 



J ohn Myers found a place at 
the rear of the observation 
room and looked around for John 
Lurie. He saw busy shirt-sleeved 
technicians, moving hurriedly as 
though the countdown were al- 
ways a crucial three seconds ahead 
of them; there were stolid generals 
and a few administrators shifting 
uneasily from foot to foot, their 
featares heavy with the weight of 
tense scowls. Here and there 
Myers saw others who like himself 
had actually had some hand in 
making the Gaea; they stood in 
murmuring groups looking at the 
varied views of the starship that 
could be seen on the screens 
scattershot around the room. 

Lurie was nowhere to be seen. 



however. Perhaps he hadn’t come 
down from his office yet; there 
was still more than half an hour 
to wait. Myers felt himself relax- 
ing. 

“Hello, John. I’m glad you 
came after all.” 

Myers started, then smiled in 
relief as he saw it was Irv Golden, 
one of the men he’d worked witli 
on the project. He put a nod of 
greeting together with the smile, 
and shook hands. 

“Hell, I couldn’t stay away. 
You knew that.” 

“Of course. Still, none of us 
were sure. I mean, we all knew 
the situation with Lurie...” 
“Even he couldn’t keep me 
away from this,” Myers said.

“I may never get closer to Alpha 
Centauri than I am right now, 
looking at that ship.” 

The viewscreen nearest them 
was slowly zooming in on the 
Gaea; Myers was suddenly struck 
by how much the ship looked 
like a fantastic crouching owl. 
He stared at it, bemused by the 
illusion. 

The Gaea didn’t look at 
all like the manned Venus and 
Mars probes of a dozen years 
before, nor the one that Kad 
landed on Ganymede. Those Kad 
been conventional, intrasystem 
rockets; the Gaea was the first 
Dallmen Drive ship, aimed at the 
stars. 

And she would get there, Myers 
knew for sure. 

To the stars and back . 

Myers had been one of the 
Gaea’s chief designers; Ke knew 
her insides, and he trusted them. 
He’d been ready to trust them to 
take him out to Centauri liim- 
self, and he still felt Ke was a 
more logical choice for crew po- 
sition than most of the men who 
now waited aboard the ship. He 
was young, still in His twenties 
though just barely and Ke was in 
good shape physically. Mentally 
too, Ke thought with a stab of 
bitterness Ke couldn’t keep down 
even now, seven months after the 
blowup. Mentally he was as stable 
as — = 

STAR DREAM 



A/Tyers heard the soft ping Oj 
the arriving elevator. Be- 
side him Irv Golden stirred. 

“Lurie,” Golden said. 

The elevator opened, and a 
power wheelchair rolled into the 
room, came to a halt before tKe 
main monitor screen and braked 
in place. Sitting in the chair, a 
fierce expression on his face, was 
old John Lurie, obviously deter- 
mined to show himself undam- 
aged in this first public appear- 
ance since his stroke. 

Myers didn’t turn to look at 
him; Ke could see the old man 
well enough without moving. The 
stroke had changed Lurie ratMcal- 
ly. He’d been looking haggard 
when Myers last saw him — ■ 
tired, driven, almost perpetaallj; 
angry — but He hadn’t looked 
old. Myem saw with a kind of 
dull shock that the man’s hair' was 
almost fully gray now, and there 
were deep lines around the eyes, 
the mouth, the jaw. His complex- 
ion seemed unnaturally sallow — ■ 
and it wasn’t from the fluores- 
cents in the room either; Lurie 
had always been an active, rud- 
dy man, and no lighting would 
have paled his face like that. 

“He looks worse than I expect- 
ed,” Golden said. “The word was 
he’d fully recovered.” 

“John wouM say that on His 
deathbed. Myers said and then 
was annoyed at the pride he felt 
in saying it. No, damn it, John Lu- 

65 



lie tHe fattier figure liad abdicated 
seven montlis ago. Lurie ttie 
founder of Intercorp (formerly 
SoutKwest Transport), designer 
of special landing assembly used 
on tKe Venus rockets, builder of 
tKe Ganymede ships and tKe Nep- 
tune fly-by . grand old man of 
space travel at 65, patron and 
mentor of tKe promising young 
engineer John Myers of six years 
ago, surrogate father, friend. All 
that was in the past, denied and 
destroyed in twenty minutes of 
furious, irrational argument. 

Damn him. 

Golden asked, “Are you going 
to say hello at least?” 

“I don’t know. I suppose the 
occasion calls for it — he did send 
me the invitation, or okayed it 
when the committee submitted 
the list to him. But hell, Irv, I 
don’t owe liim a thing. Not a 
thing.” 

Golden didn’t reply, and Myers 
turned his attention determinedly 
back to the screen and the Gaea. 
Damn him. 

T T e had never understood Lurie, 
though sometimes he’d 
tliought he had. But rapport is 
not understanding; you can share 
an emotion, a dream, without 
knowing the man you share it 
with. Myers didn’t even know 
why Lurie Kad decided he liked 
Kim, why he Kad gone out of his 
way to pry Kim loose from Mc- 

66 



Donnel Contractors witli the of- 
fer of twice the salary and a po- 
sition he couldn’t possibly be 
ready for. 

Maybe he’d just been cagy 
about that; certainly Myers Kad 
gone all out for the older man, 
and within half a year he’d been 
pulling his own weight. But it 
Kad been much more than just 
business; Lurie had taken an im- 
accountable liking to Kim from 
the start, and it had been a Sun- 
day, Thanksgiving and Christmas 
relationship right away. 

Myers had tried to ask him 
about it once. But Lurie had been 
Lurie; he did what he wanted and 
he revealed what Ke wanted, and 
the relationship was played by 
his rules. “We have the same first 
name,” he said. “And you’re 
bright, like me — brighter than 
you’d have known if I hadn’t 
forced you to show it.” He smiled 
briefly, a completely non-busi- 
nessman, human smile, always in- 
congruous on his face. “Maybe 
I wanted to build something be- 
sides aircraft and spaceships, 
John. I’ve always been a builder, 
you know, ever since I was a kid.” 

“The model planes, you mean?” 
Myers asked. 

Lurie nodded. “They were one 
of the first things, yes.” He open- 
ed the glass-fronted cabinet in 
which he kept the models. The 
earliest was a Curtiss Hawk bi- 
plane, obviously put togetlier 

GALAXY 



witli painful slowness out of 
homemade materials. One of the 
wings was cracked, and paint wa§ 
flaking from the body. 

“That was a Navy figfiteC 
bomber,” Lurie said. “I rode in 
one like it back in ’35, when I 
was eight; my uncle took me up 
in it. It was a beautiful thing, as 
big and exciting as any five-h’un- 
dred-ton spaceship we’ve built 
since. It made a fantastic amount 
of noise; I’ll never forget it. And 
the shadow . s That was tKe first 
thing about it that struck me, 
John; its sfiadow was black and 
precise and absolutely efficient. 
Mechanical. That was how I 
thought of it then; I was fascin- 
ated witH opening up clocks at 
that age. I fiad no idea then bow 
complex a mechanical thing 
could be designed — no idea at 
all of how many different kinds 
of components you’d Have to 
put into an airplane.” 

Lurie paused, remembering. “If 
I’d had any conception of what 
Has to go into a simple orbiting 
rocket. » . Hell, John, I stopped 
thinking of rockets as mechanical 
things years ago; they’re so com- 
plex you can’t xmderstand them 
except as a whole thing. Every 
one we build is almost alive to 
me now — and when we send 
them out, it’s like me going out 
there myself. Yet thesr’re still only 
mechanical things, hke clocks. 
Funny, isn’t it?” 

STAR DREAM 



Myers nodded slowly, caught 
up in the older man’s mood. “I 
know what you mean about feel- 
ing like it’s you going into space 
instead of just the rocket,” He 
said. 

“But of course it isn’t me,” 
Lurie said. “It can’t ever be me, 
because I’m too old; my heart 
would never take the acceleration. 
The biggest man in the space in- 
dustry, and I’ve never been off 
the planet . , So I send out 
machines, John — mechanical ex- 
tensions of myself.” 

Then they were both silent for 
a while, as Lurie turned the bi- 
plane in his hands, smiling wryly. 

TV yr yers didn’t have to make the 
decision whether or not to 
go over to Lurie; after a few min- 
utes Lurie came to him. As tlie 
old man’s wheelchair rolled to- 
ward him, Myers realized he’d 
made a mistake in hesitating; 
now Lurie had taken the initia- 
tive, and He would control the 
conversation as usual. As always. 

“Hello, John,” said Lurie. 

“Hello, John,” Myers said. It 
was the old settled ritual, but 
neither spoke with any warmtii. 

“I knew you’d show up. Even 
if you only built half of her, you 
Still — ” 

“The Gaea was over 90% com- 
plete when you fired me,” Myers 
said shortly. 

“That much?” For a moment 

67 



Lurie looked confused; but tbe 
expression passed. “Yes, tbat’s 
right. But we had to rebuild a lot 
of her. The entire guidance sys- 
tem, for one thing; she couldn’t 
have found Ganymede with that 
dated system you had in her.” 

Myers felt anger rising in him, 
fought to control it. “That system 
was there only because you in- 
sisted on it, and you know it. I 
submitted plans for the modified 
system, but by then you were 
caught up in finishing the ship 
to meet the government dead- 
line — ” 

“That was important!” Lurie 
snapped. “I never missed a proj- 
ect in my life.” 

“But you missed this one — 
after you fired me. You told me 
I was crazy, threw me out without 
notice, and then went ahead and 
did everything I’d recommended. 
What was the sense, John? Can 
you justify it?” 

“I gave you six months’ pay to 
fill out the term of your contract,” 
Lurie said. “And I provided you 
with a reference that got you a 
job with NASA. If you work your 
way up as fast there, you’ll be in 
charge of the next star-shot your- 
self.” 

“That’s a nice thought for your 
conscience, but none of it justi- 
fies firing me in the first place. 
Don’t try to change the subject 
again, John; I know you that 
well, at least.”

“I wasn’t changing the sub- 
ject!” Lurie leaned forward tense- 
ly, bracing himself on one arm. 
Myers abruptly realized that the 
old man’s right arm lay uselessly 
in his lap, noticed the slackness 
of the right side of his face. No 
wonder his speech seemed slurred, 
he thought; Lurie was fighting 
to cover it, but the stroke had 
left him partially paralyzed. 

“Then why did you fire me?” 
he asked, and he felt imcomfort- 
able as he heard the softness that 
now crept into his voice. Damn! 
This was the chance he’d hoped 
for for seven months, the argu- 
ment he’d rehearsed in his mind 
ever since the firing. Why. should 
he let Lurie off the hook now? 

L urie’s left hand gripped the 
chair arm tightly, knuckles 
aged and white. “You were un- 
dermining the success of the proj- 
ect,” the old man said slowly and 
deliberately. “You countermand- 
ed my express orders, you as- 
sumed authority I’d never given 
you, and your judgment was 
bad.” 

“Then why did you follow my 
recommendations after I was 
gone?” Myers demanded, forcing 
an edge into his voice. “I was 
right and you were dead wrong, 
John, but you wouldn’t okay the 
new guidance system and you 
wouldn’t even discuss it. The 
deadline, that was all you could 

GALAXY 



tliink about! What good is a fin- 
ished starship if it shoots off to 
nowhere?” 

“I’ve never missed a deadline in 
my life!” Lurie said vehemently. 
“Never!” 

"Never?” Myers looked at him 
in disbelief. “John, goddamn it, 
that ship sitting out there right 
now is six months late! How can 
you forget that?” 

Lurie shook his head slowly, 
almost disjointedly. “I never 
missed a deadline before this one 
— and I wouldn’t have missed 
this one if you hadn’t upset the 
efficiency of the project. I had 
everything xinder control, we were 
on schedule all the way, and then 
you started coming in with com- 
plaints and suggestions, wheeling 
and dealing, calling conferences 
I’d never authorized — ” 

“I only called one conference,” 
Myers said, “and that wasn’t even 
my idea; Irv Golden asked for 
tliat one. Isn’t that right, Irv?” 

He turned to Golden, and was 
immediately struck with guilt at 
drawing him into tlie argument. 
Golden had stood by imcomfort- 
ably during the entire exchange, 
carefully midway between them. 
What the hell, he still worked for 
Lurie. 

As the old man looked danger- 
ously up at him. Golden said, “I 
did ask for tire conference on 
ship’s personnel — but I sent the 
request directly to you, Mr. Lurie. 

STAR DREAM 



When you didn’t answer even the 
second time, I asked John here 
about it. I didn’t realize — ” 

“Of course you didn’t!” Lurie 
said bitterly. “You were only the 
excuse he needed; don’t worry, I 
don’t blame you for it.” He turn- 
ed back to Myers. “You were so 
determined to get control of ship’s 
personnel selection — what was 
the matter, did you think I’d go 
back on my promise to let you go 
on the ship?” 

“The ship is blasting in ten 
minutes,” Myers said quietly. 
“Am I on it?” 

( C ]\ /T addox, Juneau, Schu- 
macher, Cossato, Faulk- 
ner and Howards,” said Golden. 
“And of course you, John. That 
makes seven, and that’s all there 
are left; the old man rejected all 
the others. That includes tlie 
stand-bys too. All of which means 
we now have a month to select 
and train four more men for the 
Gaea.” 

“That’s impossible,” said Kim. 
“They couldn’t possibly learn 
their jobs even in the full month.” 
“No, not completely impossi- 
ble,” Golden said. “Some of the 
positions are more difficult than 
others, and we’ve trained the men 
we have to be able to take over 
other jobs if necessary. If we can 
choose new men quickly, we can 
train them for the easier jobs. But 
we Have to start now. John, I 

69 



don’t understand wKy Lurie got 
rid of the other men, and I can’t 
even get him to discuss choosing 
replacements. Can you tell me 
VfHy He’s putting this off?” 

Myers leaned His elbows on the 
conference table, tapped the fin- 
gers of both Hands together. It 
was an unconscious action, some- 
tfiing to do so He wouldn’t Have 
to answer the question immedi- 
ately. He didn’t know tKe answer, 
and he realized witH surprise that 
He Had been avoiding thinking 
about it. 

“I’ll tell you wfiy,” said a voice 
behind Him, and Myers jerked 
around to see Lurie standing an- 
grily in tfie doorway. His black 
Hair was unruly, his face tense 
and florid, tKe neck of His sHirt 
zipped open beneath His tie. 

Myers stood up, vacating tKe 
cHair at the Head of the confer- 
ence table. 

“No, don’t botfier,” Lurie said 
bitingly. “You look so comfort- 
able, I’d Kate to disturb you. Sit 
down, JoKn, sit down.”” 

But the rest of the men Had al- 
ready moved tKeir chans to ac- 
commodate Myers at Lurie’s 
right-hand seat. Myers took tKat, 
and after a moment Lxnie went to 
the head of the table and stood 
there angrily. 

“If you gentlemen Have any 
questions about project Gaea, I 
suggest you ask me about them in 
tfie future. I don’t like conferences 

70 



to be called behind my back.” 
Myers said, “I’m sorry, JoKn; 
your pKone Had a call-later all 
morning, and this seemed urgent. 
We do Have tfie room recorder; 
on, and I would’ve submitted tKe 
entire proceedings to you.” 

“TKat’s nice,” Lurie said. “May 
I ask wKat was so urgent that you 
Had to discuss it without me?” 
Golden cleared His throat nerv- 
ously. “It’s the question about 
ship’s personnel, Mr. Lurie — 
you’ll remember I sent you two 
memos about it.” 

“I was busy,” said Lurie. “You 
gentlemen don’t seem to realize 
it, but we have just one month to 
get our bird off tKe ground. Unne- 
cessary conferences won’t get that 
done. How many of you are here? 
Five of you, all supposedly re- 
sponsible men on this project. 
Who’s minding the store?” 

“John, I think Irv’s question is 
important.” 

“It is noi important; if it Had 
been, I’d have called a conference 
myself. For your information, 
John, our bird will not be carry- 
ing eleven men to Alpha Centau- 
ri; we don’t need all of them. 
As a matter of fact, we only need 
six; I put that call-later signal 
on the phone so I could go over 
the work assignments and re-allot 
them.” 

CS/^nly six men?” said Golden. 
SJ'.. “Excuse me, but how can 

GALAXY 



we get by with! only six? You 
yourself set the number at eleven, 
and we all agreed — ” 

“I set the number at eleven, 
and I’ve re-estimated it at six,” 
Lurie said coldly. “We’re not try- 
ing to colonize Centauri; this is 
only a manned probe. Six men 
can do the job.” 

“But I don’t understand,” My- 
ers said. “John, I’m sorry, but you 
will have to explain to me how 
six men can do the work of elev- 
en.” 

“I don’t have to explain any- 
thing! I make the decisions here, 
and I’ve decided six can do it. The 
fewer men, the less payload — 
and the fewer widows left be- 
hind.” 

“Widows?” Myers said. “I 
thought we were proceeding on 
the assumption tiris will be a suc- 
cessful flight.” 

Kim had been scanning the 
crew list Golden had brought to 
the meeting; now he looked up 
and said, “Is that why you re- 
jected the men you did, Mr. 
Lurie? I notice they’re all mar- 
ried.” 

“Of course that’s the reason,” 
Lurie said. “It’s also the reason 
I decided to trim down the crew 
in the first place.” He turned 
to Myers. “For your information, 
we always proceed on the as- 
sumption that whatever project 
we imdertake will be a success; 
you can’t make plans otherwise. 

STAR DREAM 



But any new space flight is dan- 
gerous, and the Gaea will be go- 
ing 4.3 light-years and back — 
we hope. That’s a Huge first, and 
the ship is the most complicated 
unit we’ve ever even dreamed of. 
Sometimes I’m not sure even I 
understand how she works.” He 
paused, barely perceptibly, then 
went on more quietly, “John, I 
don’t know if you’ve told the oth- 
ers what you told me last night, 
but you’re not going on the 
Gaea.” 

“Not going?” Myers said un- 
believing. “But I’ve had your 
promise ever since — ” 

“That was long before you 
brought Helen around. I like her, 
John, and she loves you, that’s 
plain enough. If I send you out 
to die on the Gaea, I might as 
well send her to die too.” 

Myers stared at him. “You 
mean because I told you we’re 
getting married you’re taking me 
off the ship? Is that the reason?” 

“I’ve been thinking about this 
for a long time. John, this is a 
dangerous flight; that ship is the 
first of its kind, and it’s going 
out into — ” 

“For god’s sake, I know what 
the project is!” Myers burst out. 
“I also know the Gaea; the ship 
can make it! You've seen all the 
plans — you know the theory — 
you oversaw the construction 
right from the start. Stop giving 
me rationalizations, John. Are 

71 



you afraid of the Gaea? And if so 
— why? Because of that Venus- 
surplus guidance system that you 
refuse to change?” 

Lxirie’s expression froze. He 
stepped back from the table, hesi- 
tated, then turned for the door. 
“I’ll see you in my office, alone, 
in five minutes,” he said, and 
walked out. 

Within half an Hour — shout- 
ing, accusing, pleading, shouting 
again — Jbhn Myers was not 
only off the Gaea crew list, but 
fired from Intcrcorp. 

< ( A 11 right. I’ll tell you the 
truth,” Lurie said, sinking 
back in his power chair, his face 
seeming to visibly weaken and 
sag. His condition appeared even 
worse than Myers had thought; 
Lurie had summoned his energies 
for the confrontation with Myers, 
but a few minutes of arguing had 
drained him. 

Still ... he was Lurie. Myers 
didn’t want to let the old man 
soften him, too. 

“All right,” he said levelly. 
“What do you call the truth?” 

“Just this: you didn’t really 
want to be on the Gaea. You 
said you wanted to go, and you 
probably even believed it — but 
you didn’t really want that.” 

“Didn’t want it? What does 
that mean? Of course I wanted to 
go!” 

“No, you didn’t. You wanted 

72 



to stay here with Helen; I could 
hear it in your voice the night 
you told me about the engage- 
ment.” Even Lurie’s voice seemed 
weak now. His stiff fingers on the 
chair arm ran idly along the 
power buttons there. 

“Oh no,” Myers said. “Oh no. 
You don’t get away with that, 
John! You’re trying that line 
about firing me for my own good, 
aren’t you? Saving me from the 
dangers of space, the uncertain- 
ties — ” 

“Nonsense . nonsense. You 
know as well as I do the Gaea 
is as safe as any ship we’ve ever 
built. No, John, you just didn’t 
want to go, that was all — but I 
think you really didn’t know it. 
You couldn’t admit to yourself 
that that dream of going to the 
stars wasn’t as important to you 
as it used to be.” 

“So you had to manipulate 
things that day to force an open 
fight?” Myers said. “And in- 
stead of just taking me off the 
ship you had to fire me outright 
— is that it? I don’t buy that.” 
Lurie’s eyes were more than 
halfway closed as he looked down 
at the paralyzed hand in his lap. 
He said, “I don’t expect you to 
believe it. If you could have ac- 
cepted the idea of giving up going 
to Centauri, we could have done 
all of this reasonably, like two 
sensible men. You’d have said 
you didn’t want to go after all, 
! GAUXY 



I’d Kave been sorry and I’d Have 
let you off tlie hook. But it didn’t 
happen that way, John, because 
we’re human.” 

“I don’t buy it,” Myers said. 
“Stop it.” 

“No, let me go on; I may not 
Have that much time. I’m not the 
man I was; I go into rages, I get 
paranoiac. You saw me just a few 
minutes ago. It was happening 
back then, too, when I fired you, 
only I didn’t know it. The stroke 
finally woke me up to the situa- 
tion. Not that it’s anything new 
in the world. I’m just getting old, 
the juices don’t mix as before, 
I have to rely on pills and power 
chairs and a diet you wouldn’t 
believe either. 

“I didn’t manipulate the fight, 
John; I couldn’t prevent it. It 
had been coming for months, and 
it was my fault. Okay, you were 
right about the guidance system; 
I was pigheaded about that. And 
you were right that I was afraid 
of the system; I was pigheaded 
about that. And you were right 
tlaat I was afraid of the Gaea — 
it got too big for me, I couldn’t 
understand it, it scared hell out 
of me. But none of that was in- 
surmountable; I had good periods 
along with the bad ones, and I 
could back down if I had to. I 
did change my mind and put 
in your new guidance system la- 
ter, remember. 

“But what broke everything to 

STAR DREAM 



pieces wag when you told me 
about you and Helen — and I 
realized you Had something else 
to do with your life. It was writ- 
ten all over your face. You didn’t 
want to go to Centauri, you want- 
ed to get married and buy a 
House and commute by gyro — ” 

“No!” Myers said. “I wanted 
to go to Centauri just as mucK as. 
you did!” 

T urie just looked up at him si- 

' lently for several moments, 
letting the sentence hang in the 
air. 

Then He said, “THafs rigHt, 
you wanted to go just as much as 
I did. You didn’t want to go for 
yourself anymore, only because of 
me. Because that was what I 
manipulated, John — you, right 
from the beginning. I took you 
out of McDonnel and gave you 
a top job, taught you as much as 
I knew, made you virtually a 
son to me. I told you once that 
I was a builder — well, that was 
what I was doing with you, 
though I denied it to myself. I 
was just building another ma- 
chine, John, a more personal ma- 
chine than the Gaea, a living per- 
son who’d go out to Centauri and 
be the closest thing to me I could 
manage.” 

Lurie paused, cleared his 
throat; his voice Had taken on a 
gravelly edge. “That’s pretty dis- 
gusting, isn’t it? Using another 

73 



Eumaii being like a tool, a glori- 
fied tv monitor.” 

Myers said wonderingly, “You 
really mean tfiis, don’t you?” 
“Yes, I mean it; it’s true. Wfiy 
else would I Eave been so furious 
,wKen you wanted to drop out? I 
was so toucHy — so guilty — 
SiBat you didn’t even Eave to say 
io me, ‘JoEn, I want out.’ I knew 
T& before you did.” 

Lurie did close Eis eyes now, 
aad raised Eis veined Eand to 
press tEe bridge of Eis nose. My- 
ers saw him breathing deeply, la- 
boriously, and for a panic mo- 
ment he tEougEt tEe old man was 
having another stroke. But then 
Ee saw the tears. 

From the overhead speaker 
came a voice saying, “Blast minus

cEair’s console. He moved behind 
tEe chair and began to pusE it 
over to the main monitor screetf. 

“Clear your eyes, JoEn, or you 
are going to miss the first blast- 
off for the stars,” Myers said. 

TEe power chair was heavier 
than Ee’d expected; by the time 
Ee had Lurie positioned in front 
of the screen Ee was out of breatE. 
Panting, he drew up one of tEe 
room’s lounging cEairs and sat 
down beside the old man. Lurie 
Ead recovered himself, but Ee 
only stared at the screen silently. 

“ . seventeen . sixteen .

“What you said makes sense,” 
Myers said. “Except that people 
aren’t steel; you can’t melt them 
down and pour them into a mold 
to make a machine. It isn’t that 
simple; nobody accepts somebody 
rise’s dream unless Ee wants it.”

The starship built a cushion of 
smoke and fire beneath it, then 
slowly rose into tEe sky. The 
monitors tracked it as it acceler- 
ated; the changing angle of vision 
made it seem as though the Gaea 
were curving over and away. But 
it was still going straight up and 
out. 

“You’re right about NASA,” 
Myers said. “I’ll be on the next 
one.”

COLOI^RED ELEMENT 

by ALICE LAURANCE and WILLIAM CARLSON 



The colors weren't so bad 
— until they became colours. 



Tt’s just not true that we planned 
it this way, as anybody wKo’s 
read the serious articles about us 
knows very well. You can’t be- 
lieve those whoppers they print 
in the newspapers — why, Half 
of them don’t even know “color” 
is spelled “colour” when it refers 
to people like us! 

If Ben and I Had planned it, 
we certainly wouldn’t have been 
shocked wKen we walked into that 
boarding house dining room. But 
we were. Not by the landlady — 
she was coloured pink just like 
pae. Or Her Husband, wHose bright 
red hue matched Ben’s exactly. 
That we Had expected. But when 
we saw that lodger — saints 
alive, you talk about flabbergast- 



ed! The man, name of Jarvis, was 
bright blue! And his wife was yel- 
low! Not like Orientals, who are 
not yellow any more than Cau- 
casians are white. I mean yellow 
— like a taxicab, like the middle 
of a daisy. Yellow! 

Ben just dragged me upstairs 
and slammed the door — hard. 
“Wh-what happened?” I said. 
“I don’t know.” 

“They were blue and yellow.” 
“Goddamnit, I know tliey were 
blue and yellow! They should 
have been red.” 

“Maybe you should have ex- 
perimented some more before — ” 
He grabbed me by the Hand. 
“C’mon, Miss Sally — something 
is radically wrong.” 



Well, we started driving around 
and something sure was haywire. 
We saw crowds of bewildered and 
confused people. And they were 
red, yellow, blue, and green. Ben 
stopped the car and pulled a pad 
out of his pocket. For almost 
thirty minutes he noted the dif- 
ferent colours as they passed, 
then added up the figures. As ev- 
eryone knows about 45% were 
red or pink, 40% blue 10%. yel- 
low and 5 % green. 

Ben got tliat glazed look in 
his eye for a couple minutes; 
then he muttered, “Blood type.” 

“What?” 

“Blood type. It affects the col- 
our. Let’s see, you’re O, aren’t 
you?” 

“Why yes! However did you 
know?” 

“Unless I’m mistaken all the 
red are O, the blues A, yellows 
B, and greens AB. Lord, what a 
mess!” 

“Oh well,” I said, “at least 
tliey’re immune from measles.” 

“They are that,” said Ben, stok- 
ing his pipe, “but it’s still a bit 
frustrating. After all our work to 
make them red, here we are with 
a blasted rainbow.” Ben lit his 
pipe and wreaths of smoke twin- 
ed about his head. 

’’Science is sure unpredictable,” 
I said, wrinkling my nose. I did 
not sneeze though. I never sneeze 
when Ben smokes. That’s how I 
met him, you know. 

76 



e were in this elevator 

this was up North in New 
York — and Ben was smoking 
a pipe and I wasn’t sneezing. I 
couldn’t believe it. I’m violently 
allergic to tobacco, but I wasn’t 
sneezing at all, so naturally I 
looked at him. He was redheaded, 
very handsome, and he had the 
worst sxmburn I’ve ever seen. I 
mean he was scarlet! 

By that time the elevator had 
gotten down to the lobby, and 
since I had nothing to do, I fol- 
lowed him. I wanted to know 
what he was smoking, but I could 
not figure out how to ask him. 

We’d gone about two blocks 
when he suddenly stopped dead 
and turned around. “Why are 
you following me?” he demanded. 

I was mortified, but I wasn’t 
going to miss my chance! “What’s 
that you’re smoking?” I asked. 

“What’s that I’m smoking? 
Why honey chile, it’s jest a lil’ 
ole pipe.” 

I hate it when people make fun; 
of my accent. And this guy had 
the worst fake Southern accent 
in the history of the world. “I 
mean, what’s in it?” 

“What’s your name?” 

“Sally Vickers. What’s yours?” 
“Ben Browning. Do you always 
talk to strange men. Miss Sally?” 

I looked down in my best shy; 
Southern manner and shook my 
head. “It’s just that it’s important 
to me,” I said. 




GALAXY 



“Important enougli to Have 
dinner witK me?” 

“Well . Well all rigHt, if you 
insist.” 

“OH I do, Miss Sally, I do.” 
We went to a little French res- 
taurant, and Ben ordered for us 
both, without even consulting me. 
It wasn’t that I minded — but 
I thought it was significant. “UH, 
what do you do, Ben?” I asked. 

“Ahm a chemical engineer,” 
he drawled. “What-all do you- 
all do?” 

Well that tore it! “One thing 
I don’t do is go around making 
fun of people’s accents! And for 
your information, you-all is pro- 
nounced y’all and should only be 
used when speaking to more than 
one person. It’s a perfectly re- 
spectable second person plural.” 
I wish you-all could have seen 
His face! “I’m a receptionist,” I 
added with dignity. 

“Oh,” he said. “Is my accent 
really that bad?” 

“It’s atrocious,” I said. 

He started laughing. Frankly, I 
didn’t get the joke. But I rather 
liked the twinkle in his warm 
browti eyes! 

While we ate some marvelous 
escargots, I managed to pry out 
of Ben that he was California 
bom and educated, hadhisPh.D., 
was 38, single, and — judging by 
the looks he was giving me — 
normal male. Though with that 
sunburn how he could even think 
THE COLOURED ELEMENT 



of girls was beyond me. But Ee 
said it looked worse than it was. 

It was my turn then. But He 
just smiled when I told him about 
Bennington psychology major 
and my law office job. He said 
he’d rather hear about life be- 
hind the cotton curtain. 

T didn’t much like his phrase 
but I did my best to tell him 
about the beauty and friendli- 
ness of my home town. Ben acted 
like a man listening to a fairy 
tale. “Haven’t you ever been 
South?” I asked desperately. 

“Not to your South,” he said 
shortly. 

We’d finished dessert by that 
time, and Ben pulled out his pipe. 
“You were going to tell me what 
you’re smoking, remember?” 

“I surely will. Miss Sally. It’s 
lettuce.” 

“Lettuce?” 

“Plain lettuce leaves, cured like 
tobacco. Or almost like tobacco.” 
“But — why?” 

“I like it.” 

“Where do you get it?” 
“Make my own, but it is com- 
mercially available.” He pulled 
out a pad and scribbled some- 
thing on it. “Write to these peo- 
ple.” 

“I will — uh, if I ever Have to. 
Thank you kindly.” 

“You’re welcome kindly. Now 
— suppose I see you home.” 

He did, and after thanking him 

77 



for the diiuier I waited in the 
doorway, giving ffim a chance to 
ask for my p!fone number or say 
He’d be seeing me soon, but He 
didn’t and I couldn’t; so wfieit 
he did I just said, “Good nigKt.” 
Damn being a gxrl sometimes, I 
thought. 

Four days later — on a Satur- 
day — the doorbell rang in the 
middle of the afternoon. It was 
a steaming July day, my apart- 
ment was a wreck, and I’d just 
finished washing my hair. “OH 
damn!” I waded. 

“Now Miss Sally,” said Ben, 
looking as neat as an unmaded 
envelope, “where’s' that famous 
Soutlrern hospitality? Aren’t you 
going to ask me in?” 

“Yes, of course,” I said. “Come 
on in. But everything’s a mess.” 
Mess wasn’t tlie word for it — 
there isn’t a word for it — 
but he didn’t seem to mind. 

“You see. Miss Sally, I sudden- 
ly got this terrible hankerin’ for 
hominy grits. So I went out, 
bought a box, and here ah is! You 
will cook ’enrt for me, won’t you?” 

“Why sure.” I’m the South’^ 
worst cook, but I wasn’t going 
to tell him that. I fixed him a 
drink and went into the kitchen 
to cook those pesky grits. That’s 
when I first got suspicious. 

You see, Ben’s sxmburn was ex- 
actly the same as before. That 
wasn’t natural; it should have 
faded or peeled or something. I

peeked out to make sure and He 
was as red as ever. You can main- 
tain a tan, but not a burn, so I 
started supposing all kinds of 
things. 

I finally got the grits done and 
brought them in. “Wonderful,” 
fie said after a bite. Believe me, 
they weren’t — but he choked 
them down, smiled weakly, and 
said, “You busy tonight. Miss 
SaUy?” 

Now Mama’s always said a 
girl should never let on to being 
available if a man asks for a date 
for the same night, but I thoughts 
to hell vsnth Mama. “Ufi — no, 
not really.” 

“Good! Then why don’t we go 
out to dinner? And later I’ll show 
you how to cure lettuce leaves.” 

And that means going back to 
your place, I thought. I wasn’t 
counting on his sunburn as a de- 
terrent now, but I figured — 
don’t remember wHat I figured — 
but I know what 1 said. “I’ll be 
ready in twenty minutes.” 

“Take your time. Miss Sallyij 
take your time.” 

Y ou know, he wasn’t kidding 
about the lettuce leaves. Af- 
ter dinner we went to his place 
— which turned out to be more 
of a laboratory than an apart- 
ment — and he showed me the 
whole process. After that we just 
stood there looking at each other 
— I wasn’t scared, but I wasn’t 

GALAXY 



exactly comfortable eitKer. “Uh — 
what are those?” I said, pointing 
to some covered cages. 

“Mice, Miss Sally.” 

“Eekl” I said, since fie seem- 
ed to expect it, though fie sKould 
have realized I’d worked with 
mice in psycKology. Monkeys 
too. I didn’t mind a little old 
mouse. 

But wfiy were they covered? 
And wfiat did they have to do 
with chemical engineering? And 
how did his sunburn fit in? Or 
did it? Curiouser and curiouser, 
as my old Grams used to say. I 
decided I’d better approach it 
sort of roundabout. “Ufi, what 
company do you work for, Ben?” 
“I free-lance,” he said. It turn- 
ed out fie Bad a whole string of 
patents, mainly on processes con- 
nected with water, such as fluori- 
dation and desalination. He’d 
taken post-doctoral courses in bi- 
ochemistry and now was experi- 
menting witH putting vaccines 
right in the water. Well, that ex- 
plained the mice, though not wfiy 
they were all covered up. His pre- 
occupation with disease seemed 
downright tinfiealthy to me, and 
how did tfiat jibe with his — 
then I got it! Here fie was: 
young, handsome — red as a beet. 
It had to be some mysterious and 
probably fatal disease. It was 
tragic. I was sure of it when fie got 
me all the way home without 
trying anything more than a

measley peck on the cheek. 

We did make a date for Sun- 
day, though. I figured if his days 
were numbered, this was no time 
to be coy. It was on Sunday I 
discovered I’d been right about 
his sunburn. It was no deterrent. 

I saw him again on Monday 
and that was the day I decided 
I’d rather have a sick Ben Brown- 
ing than a healthy anybody, and 
if I let this man get away I was 
insane. 

Then he stopped calling. 

T was miserable. I was frantic! 
-*• I was out of my mind! I field 
myself in on Tuesday and 
Wednesday, and somehow got 
tfirougli Thursday, but by Fri- 
day I couldn’t stand it any more; 
and directly after work I went 
right down to Kis place and Kam- 
mered on the door. I didn’t wait 
for an answer. The door was un- 
locked so I barged right in. 

“Sally!” He made a desperate 
attempt to hide tfie mice, but 
it was too late — I’d already seen 
them. They were shocking pink. 

“Benjamin Browning, what did 
you do to those mice?” I said. 

“The same thing I did to my- 
self,” fie said miserably. He still 
had the sxmburn. 

“I tfiought so!” 

“It’s why I didn’t call you 
again.” 

“Wfiy?” I screamed. 

“Because I’m a Negro.” 



79 



“Well, is that all?” I flopped 
down on a cKair in sheer relief. 
“My goodness, I thought you 
were dying!” 

“But I never — ” 

“How did you turn red?” 

“It’s a side effect. I was work- 
ing on a vaccine against measles 
which could be dissolved in wa- 
ter and taken orally, and I’ve 
found it. Except it turned these 
dam mice pink — and it turned 
me red. At first I tried to counter- 
act it, but then I saw! Sally, this 
will solve the race problem! If we 
get people to take this vaccine 
there wouldn’t be any races. Just 
red men. I was tempted to give 
you some — ” 

“How dare you?” I said, jump- 
ing up and stamping my foot. 
“I am not going to be turned red. 
At least ...” 

“At least?” 

“Well, at least not until after 
you marry me. ” 

“What the devil are you talking 
about?” he shouted. 

“Well, I understand Negroes 
get married too. Will our children 
be red?” 

“I don’t know. Damn it, Sal- 
ly — ” 

“Hey, I’ve got a great idea — ■ 
let’s turn the whole country red!” 
“It isn’t that simple.” 

“Of course it is.” 

“The vaccine could turn every- 
one red, but I’m sure people 
won’t accept it.” 

80 



“They’ll have to accept it.” 
“What?" He really shouted that 
word. 

“It’s perfectly simple. We get 
married and go on a honeymoon. 
We pick out cities — maybe a 
whole state — dump the stuff Id 
the reservoirs and everybody 
turns red.” 

“It takes a month.” 

“All right, it takes a month.” 
“It could be done, of course," 
he said slowly. 

“You bet it could.” 

“You’re serious about marry- 
ing me?” 

“You hardly know me.” 

“Well you don’t know me 
either, and you want to marry 
me.” He hadn’t actually said so, 
but he did, all right. 

^■y^he upshot was we got married 
three days later, I took Ben’s 
vaccine and we drove off on our 
honeymoon. Two days later we 
immunized our first city. 

The cities were easy — Ben 
just dropped his vaccine into the 
reservoirs. But lots of the smaller 
towns had standpipes, and some- 
times he had to use his chemist’s 
credentials to get permission to 
inspect the waterworks, so he 
could slip the vaccine in. 

We spent most of the month 
dispensing our colourful little 
vaccine. Just before I was due 
to turn, we went back to the first 
city we immunized. We registered 

GALAXY 



in a boarding house under as- 
sumed names, and waited for ttie 
fun to begin. 

Sure enough, I turned just 
when Ben said, but I wasn’t ex- 
actly red. I was more pink — 
sort of cherry toned. My eyes are 
gray — people’s eyes don’t change 

— and I liked my new colour 
quite well — except I couldn’t 
use my old make-up. 

Ben was worried about my new 
colour. He thought maybe it was 
lighter because I’d been white, 
and that wouldn’t have been any 
good, but it turned out it was 
because I’m a girl. Women arc 
always a little lighter than men, 
except for anemics. They’re posi- 
tively pastel, regardless of sex. 

Two days later the whole city 

— which happened to be the state 
capitol — turned, and we got hit 
over the head with the rainbow 
Ben had created. After he figured 
out the blood type business, he 
put away his pad, restoked his 
pipe, and got that hazy look in 
his eye. I just watched the people 
walk by, and decided the differ- 
ent coloui"s were rather pretty 
when you got used to them. 

Pretty soon, Ben’s eyes focused 
again and he said, “We’d better 
get back and see what’s happen- 
ing.” We returned to the board- 
ing house and turned on the TV. 
All hell had broken loose. A state 
of emergency had been declared, 
and martial law and a curfew 
THE COLOURED ELEMENT 



were already in effect. Within tiie 
next few days, as more cities and 
towns began to turn, the whole 
state was sealed off “for the dura- 
tion.” 

“It’s going to be a mighty long 
duration,” Ben said. “The only 
antidote is deadly poison.” 

What happened next is history, 
I guess. The Governor issued a 
statement. The President issued 
a statement. The Pope issued a 
statement. The Secretary-General 
issued a statement. Fourteen sen- 
ators issued statements and so did 
twenty-three congressmen, and 
there wasn’t a sensible word in 
the lot. , 

Among regular people, the fiirst 
reaction most had was to take a 
bath — a lot of baths. Then there 
was a soap run on the supermar- 
kets, until people found out that 
no brand would remove the col- 
our. Then the Great Migration 
began. You couldn’t get out of 
the state, but you could move 
around inside it — and people 
did. Every day — for a month — 
as new towns turned, people 
started moving. At first it was to 
try to escape — then most people 
who’d left home went back. 

And Negroes — former Negroes 
— oh, you know what I mean — 
they just went. Any place. They 
soon realized if they showed up 
where no one knew them, tliey’d 
be just like everyone else. Some 
people say you can tell but I don’t 

81 



believe it. Sure, black people Have 
kiaky hair and big Kps and flat- 
tisS noses — Sometimes. And 
sometimes tHey don’t and some- 
times Caucasians do. And even 
wKen they do, tEere are al- 
ways plastic surgery and wigs 
and hair straigEteners. So no- 
body could tell for sure after 
the change, and guessing was dan- 
gerous. I mean, just for example, 
the Governor himself had a flat 
kind of nose — college boxing^ 
tEey said — and rather big lips, 
and everybody knew he’d been 
white since birtH. Or thought so, 
anyway. 

O nce immigration was resumed, 
we had quite an influx of 
Negroes from other states hop- 
ing to catcH whatever it was, and 
of course tEey did, a montH after 
their first drink of water. Nobody 
could leave, tEougE — the sur- 
rounding states Had us in quar- 
antine. And I mean they enforced 
it — you’d Have thought colour- 
ed people were lepers. 

The Negro immigration stop- 
ped, of course, wEen the original 
supply of resawoir water was 
used up and people stopped turn- 
ing but even so, we went 
from 24tH to 17tE in population! 
rank in just three years. Mean- 
while, the Department of Health 
was investigating. 

It took them a month to figure 
out the busine^ about blood type 
82 



that Ben had guessed right away, 
and it was the longest time before 
they tumbled to tEe water busi- 
ness. But then a cEemist finally 
isolated Ben’s vaccine and every- 
body started screaming sabotage^ 
And once that cry was raised, if 
took just about no time for sev- 
eral of tEe Water Commissioners 
to remember the sunburned mart 
wHo’d visited them about a month 
before aU the trouble started. We 
sEouldn’t Have gone back to using 
our right names I guess, but Bert 
would never Eave been able to 
get tEe loan to start his business 
otherwise, so we figured what the 
Eeck. Anyway, as everybody 
knows, they caugEt us. 

By that time we were doing 
right well. Owned our own Home 
and everything. Ben remembered 
my problems with make-up, and 
he put together a Kttle laboratory 
and concocted powder and lip- 
stick and stuff for the new col- 
ours. His lab soon became a fac- 
tory and pretty soon He had 50’ 
people working for him. His fouij 
Knes — Goldenrod Yellow, Peach- 
es’n’cream Pink, Crystal Blue, 
and Dixie-Belle-Green were all a 
huge success. Still are. 

So, Kke I said, they caugEt us 
and arrested us. Then the legal 
fun began! In the first place, no- 
body could figure out what to 
cEarge us with. And when you 
come right down to it, wEat had 
we done? They finally had to dig 

GALAXY 



out an ancient law about well- 
poisoning, wfiicfi was silly because 
we’d never even looked at any old 
well. 

They let us out on bail and 
our lawyer — who’s red like us 
— said he tKougKt Ke could get 
us off. But then the Feds had to 
get their two cents in, so they 
preferred conspiracy charges and 
then there was this big jurisdic- 
tional dispute and — well, no- 
body won. Yet. We’re still out 
on bail. 

Now there’s been so much rub- 
bish written about how Ben’s 
vaccine is either the world’s worst 
disaster or else its greatest hope 
that I thought I’d wind this up 
by telling what really happened 
down here. Does the vaccine solve 
the race problem? Well, yes and 
no. It solves the Negro and white 
problem all right. It’s pretty hard 
to keep a prejudice in good re- 
pair when you can’t even tell who 
it is you hate. But you see, the 
reds and greens and yellows and 
blues can tell each other apart, 
and I’ll be jiggered if they haven’t 
started putting out tliis colour; 
superiority stuff. 

>^he greens started it. They’re 
type AB of course — the 
universal recipients. They said 
they were the elite, being only 
.4% of the people. But the other 
colours said if anything they were 
mongrel, because they were a seq- 
THE COLOURED ELEMENT 



ondary color, and they could take 
any type of blood. Well the greens 
came right back and said that 
proved their superior adaptabil- 
ity. 

Meantime, our people -- the 
reds — were proclaiming we were 
the best because we were the 
majority; but the others said that 
Just proved we were common. And 
then the blues chimed in, talking 
about blue blood and the color 
of purity and all, which made 
everybody kind of mad. The yel- 
lows talked about gold and sun- 
shine and pointed out that their 
colour was fairest and closest to 
natural — which was disputed by 
the pink women.! 

Nowadays things Have begun to 
sort themselves out. Coloured 
folks don’t mix much. Oh, you 
work with other colours, and the 
kids all go to the same schools, 
but they usually sit in different 
parts of the room, and people 
usually divide buses and restau- 
rants and such into sections and 
don’t mingle. Socially, there is vir- 
tually no mixing. You just make 
friends among your own type, 
and you hardly ever Hear of a 
mixed marriage. It isn’t prejudice. 
More taste. The colours do dash, 
after all. 

I feel sorry for the kids some- 
times. If they turn a different 
colour, or are bom a different col- 
our from their parents, it can be 
pretty rough on tiSem — and on 

83 



the parents. It’s been much! bet- 
ter since they started the Rain- 
bow Clubs for people with dif- 
ferent coloured children. They’re 
something like these organizations 
for the families of alcoholics or 
retarded children, and I under- 
stand they do wonderful work. 

Ben’s offer to colour the whole 
country has already had so much 
publicity I don’t have to go into 
that. I doubt if the vaccine will 
ever be accepted officially, but 
since the formula became public 
it won’t make any difference. The 
last total I saw was 163 coloured 
cities and towns outside our state, 
and it’s going up every week. 
Somebody wants this country col- 
oured, and the laws aren’t stop- 
ping him, and the guards at the 
reservoirs aren’t stopping him. 
But don’t worry — now that we 
have got cosmetics and the new 
fashions and everything, you’ll 
find it rather pleasant being red. 



or blue, or yellow, or green. And 
you’ll never get the measles either! 

As for Ben and me, we’re not 
complaining. We have an ador- 
able little baby and we’re going 
to have another next month. Ben 
Jr. is red just like his Daddy, 
and we’re hoping for a little 
pink girl next. 

I personally don’t believe this 
stuff about reds being better than 
everybody else. Ben and I agree 
100 percent that it’s mere coin- 
cidence that red has always been 
the color associated with royalty 
and that the vast majority of bril- 
liant and distinguished men in 
this country are red — or will be 
when they turn. Ben has said a 
million times — and I agree — 
that a man shouldn’t be judged 
by his colour.

GALAXY 



KILLERBOT ! 



by DEAN R. KOONTZ 



The war was humane, as wars went. 
If didn't destroy nations. It merely 
destroyed families, wives, children — 



^^lie tfieater was a tKunder-liz- 
ard’s maw gorged with peo- 
ple, the seats jutting in rows of 
imitation teeth', casting black 
shadows in the flush of yellow 
half-light. The screen pulsed with 
colors, its rectangular orb awash 
with delusions. The two-dimen- 
sional inhabitants of that false, 
flat reality moved into view be- 
fore a pounding blue-white surf 
behind the black and yellow and 
crimson credits that crawled like 
well-trained insects up the broad 
screen, always in perfect time 
with the tinny music. 

And, abruptly, the air was fill- 
ed with deadly steel bees. 

Jacobs slipped from his seat, 
dragging Anne with him to 



crouch in the sheltered trough 
between the rows as darts rang 
against the metal backing of the 
chairs. He had his gun out, 
searching. 

Carefully, he raised his head 
and looked about the theater, 
open to attack, and spotted the 
blonde. She was fifteen rows back. 
She had stripped down the top 
of her organdy dress to free her 
breasts, marred by the thin, red 
surgical lines. Below each scar 
were six pinholes: dartgun bar- 
rels that punctured the skin like 
gigantic pores. Jacobs knew the 
breasts were hollow of flesh and 
contained, instead, dart clips 
and firing mechanisms packed in 
a silicone shell. The war had just 



85 



begun and already Ke knew tKe 
basic mechanisms. 

He aimed. 

TKe blonde wHirled — not out 
of malice, but in Her pre-pro- 
grammed fire-pattern — twelve 
barrels swinging in Eis direction. 
Jacobs depressed tKe trigger. TKe 
automatic bmped out three frag- 
mentation slugs. They tumbled 
the blonde backward in the dark, 
a final sputter of darts ringing 
from tKe backs of the seats in 
front of her. 

Ringing. 

"D inging. He woke to gloom. 

For several seconds, Ke was 
not certain whether reality was; 
A — the bed and the peaceful 
room clothed in gray light, or B 
— the half-darkened theater and 
the killerbot spewing thin death 
across the rows of patrons. He 
blinked his eyes, yawned, felt his 
ears pop. The ringing was the 
phone, not thousands of metal 
thorns richocKeting off theater 
seats. He reached out, answered 
it. “Lo?” 

“Phil?” 

“Plmmm?” 

It was Cullen. Reedy voice, 
whined words. He was second in 
command — first in command on 
this, Jacobs’ one night off — on 
the Northside Sector anti-killer- 
bot force and was capable enough 
to keep things purring. Or should 
be. 

S6 



“Seems like a bad one, Phil.” 
“Where?” He fought to main- 
tain drowsiness in hopes he might 
yet return to dream-filled uncon- 
sciousness. All sleep was dream- 
filled now days. 

“Medarts Building. Tenth floor. 
He’s extremely well-armed. Darts 
and bullets.” 

“Both?” That sent a shiver 
through him. It was difficult 
enough to implant a single weap- 
on system into a human body. 
Even with the new neutral syn- 
thetic fibers that composed most 
of the mechanisms, the body 
fought the rejection of alien tis- 
sues. Supposedly, it would never 
be economically feasible to build 
more than one weapon into a kil- 
lerbot. Recovery and healing 
time required for two systems was 
six times as long. Half a dozen 
single-system killerbots could be 
prepared and dispatched in tlie 
same time needed to finish one 
double-systems bot. But if Euro 
Had come up with a way to make 
it pay off, a method of reducing 
healing time. 

“Both,” Cullen confirmed. 
“Maybe you have two of them 
trapped up there.” 

“Could be. But I don’t tliink 
so. Even assuming there are two 
up there, the battle pattern is un- 
usual. They don’t fire in a pre- 
programmed grid; they only fire 
when there is a target.” 

“Impossible!” It had to be! If 
GALAXY 



thiat killerbot were firing at tar- 
gets instead of on a pattern:, it 
meant tKe damn ttiing Had some 
control of its finer reasoning pow- 
ers. But if you gave a killerbot 
reasoning powers, it would soon 
reason that it had once been a 
human being, that it had been 
stripped of its humanity, that its 
mind had been bleached, its stom- 
ach or chest or thigh contamin- 
ated with a deadly weapons sys- 
tem. It would revolt, surely. 

“Just the same,” Cullen said, 
anxiety riding his voice with keen 
spurs, “I think you had better 
come down here.” 

He gave up trying to keep his 
mind clouded and his body next 
to sleep. “I’ll be there as soon 
as I can.” He placed the phone 
in its cradle and pushed himself 
to the edge of the bed. For the 
thousandth time, he reminded 
himself that the captain of an 
anti-killerbot sector team had no 
real life of his own. 

He dressed, struggled into liis 
raincoat, and swallowed a cup of 
hot coffee in thx-ee large gulps. 
Then he went into the bedroom 
to tell Anne he was leaving before 
he remembered that Anne was 
dead. 

Then He went and strapped on 
Kis gun. 

/^utside, it was raining. Cold 
rain. It sliced the hairlike fog 
that wrapped the trees and spit- 
KILLERBOT 



curled the darkness. It crawled 
His skin with aching dampness* 
cEilled Kis bones to the marrow* 
There was no lightening. The 
blackness was, impenetrable. 

He found the car in front of 
the house after first looking in 
the garage. The door swung open 
to the touch of his thumb as the 
lock recognized his print. Climb- 
ing in, he started the engine, 
swung across the narrow second- 
ary road to the ramp of the auto- 
way. Punching co-ordinates for 
the Medical Arts Building Ke 
leaned back, closing his eyes as 
the car maneuvered into the high- 
speed lane of the twelve lane 
autoway. 

He took control of the car at 
the bottom of the ramp and drove 
onto Sycamore Avenue. A hun- 
dred yards ahead, a barricade 
slashed the road, ringed with por- 
table yellow lights that bathed 
the slick pavement in ugly amber 
flush. The reflection of the bulbs 
in the ice-slushed puddles, curl- 
ing and wiggling, reminded him 
of a carnival midway after clos- 
ing time on a damp Saturday 
night near the end of the season. 
Aching with the realization that 
carnivals were but another thing 
necessarily outlawed as protection 
against killerbot mass-murders, 
Ke pulled the car into the shadow 
of the portable barricade wall. 
Bursts of bullets rang across the 
roof and down the trunk until he 

87 



was sBelded tiy tSe metal parti- 
tion. 

“Mr. Cullen said to send you 
figlit to the front,” the officer 
said, openeing the door for Ja- 
cobs. “You’re going to have to 
dress for it, though.” 

“How many dead?” 

“Fourteen civilians. Nine of 
us.” 

“Nine!” 

The officer winced at the im- 
plied criticism. “Nothing could 
be done. Captain. It opened fire 
before rush hour. Senseless, that. 
The first part of the staggered 
rush would have been coming 
down this street fifteen minutes 
later. If it had waited, it could 
have killed five times fourteen. 
So we went in with dart-proofs, 
’cause it was using darts. How 
could we guess it would have two 
weapon systems? A dart-proof 
suit is structured to stop needle- 
point pressure. A bullet is some- 
thing else again.” 

Jacobs accepted a bullet-proof 
jacket from a second man, laced 
the front tightly shut and hung 
a heavy bibb over the lacing. 
The officers helped him into a 
pair of bulky slacks of thick, 
cross-hatched nylon pressure re- 
sistants. “Tell Cullen I’m coming 
through,” he said, shuffling un- 
comfortably toward the edge of 
the barricade, slipping the bulky 
nylon-steel mesh hood oyer his 
head^ 

88 



A Hundred yards of bare street 
stretched between this barricade 
and the next. The second im- 
placement was a portable metal 
well behind which Cullen and 
four officers crouched, watching 
the tenth floor of the Medarts 
Building through tiny lenses im- 
bedded in the portable barrier. 
Cullen, radio to ear, looked back 
at the first barricade as he learn- 
ed of Jacob’s arrival. A moment 
later, he and the other four men 
opened fire on the tenth floor 
window, providing Jacobs with 
a sort of cover. 

Jacobs shuffled around the 
barrier and began a labored 
progress across the no-man’s land. 

Y ellow light danced over His 
shoulders and shivered in the 
puddles, shattering like glass 
when He slopped the icy water 
with his feet. 

He was thirty yards along 
before the killerbot saw him and 
turned its attention from the men 
at the barricade to him. There 
was a tinkling of darts against 
the rough fiber of the suit. But 
they fell away like wind-driven 
dandelion puffs suddenly de- 
prived of propulsion. Quickly 
sensing the uselessness of the 
dart weapon, the killerbot opened 
fire with its frag slugs. 

But that was impossible! Kil- 
lerbots couldn’t reason like that! 
If they could, they certainly 

GAUXY 



would revolt at Saving been used 
for disposal weapon carriers. 
Take a man; bleach his brain; 
throw away his memory, crum- 
pled and useless: program him 
vnth basic human habits and an 
automatic, unsensing minor vo- 
cabularly; program him with a 
destruction mission ; turn him 
loose. That is a killerbot. It can’t 
reason in the heat of battle. Or 
never had been able to before. 

The bullets weren’t penetrating 
the heavy armor, but they rain- 
ed down too fast to let him walk 
a straight line to the front barri- 
cade. It was like walking in a 
raging wind, a spurting progress, 
unsteady and unsure. 

For a short moment, the bul- 
lets stopped. — ^Jacobs doubled his 
efforts and shuffled faster, pass- 
ing the halfway mark. 

Kack-ack-ack! A fantastic 
barrage of shells tore against his 
chest, toppling him. The suit still 
held, but he had had the wind 
knocked from him. He lay very 
still, choking on the stale air that 
penetrated the thin eye slits of 
the hood, his stomach throb- 
ing with protest, his lungs afire 
with the need for oxygen. Slowly, 
he forced the pain from his chest 
and regained a normal — if some- 
what speeded — ^ breathing pat- 
tern. Then he concentrated on ap- 
pearing dead. 

Bullets skipped over the pave- 
ment, richocheted from his suit. 

KILLERBOT 



The ice water shimmered with 
the rippled wakes of the shells. 
Finally, the killerbot stopped fir- 
ing. Jacobs lay still, thankful 
that the bulk of the suit conceal- 
ed the rise and fall of the rib cage. 
Several minutes passed. The kil- 
lerbot opened up again for thirty 
seconds, then stopped again. 
Time crawled by unbearably 
slow. Five minutes. Ten. Fifteen. 
Jacobs thought it might be safe 
now. He licked his lips of the 
sweat that had trickled down his 
face, tasted the salty fluid on his 
tongue. It would take him the 
best part of a minute to gain his 
feet, considering the weight of the 
bullet-proof garments. He would 
just have to hope that the killer- 
bot would not be watching him, 
would not see him until he had 
gained at least ten yards. Sucking 
in breath, he pushed up with his 
hands. 

He was lucky. Apparently, the 
killerbot had shifted its attention 
back to the men at the front bar- 
ricade. He found his feet, wig- 
gled on weak, shaky legs. That 
was not good. He would have to 
will away any weakness until he 
had reached the comparative safe- 
ty of the walls ahead. Laboriously, 
he dragged himself along. He had 
gone another thirty yards before 
the killerbot caught the move- 
ment and opened with heavy frag 
slug fire. 

The slight downward trend in 

S9 



the street Had Helped Him. He 
rolled, bullets pinging front tfie 
pavement on all sides. 

Abruptly^ tHe thudding of 
sKells against His fibrous armor 
peased. Hands groped for Him', 
pulled off His Hood. He blinked 
His eyes, looked up into Cullen’s 
tfiin, young face, and smiled. 
“TKanks.” 

“I tKougKt you were dead!” 
“So did it.” He stopped grin- 
ning. “WKat’s tKe situation?” 

“I tHink it’s going to be a front- 
on attack. Any normal killerbot 
would Have exposed itself to om 
fire by now. It is cunning. And 
I think it must Have some sort 
of shield.” 

“They wouldn’t waste a sfiield 
on a killerbot!” Jacobs said, men- 
tally tabulating the high cost of 
manufacturing and maintaining a 
shield projector. They were even 
too expensive for normal police 
work. 

“Just tHe same — ” 

“Well, if we Have to initiate a 
frontal, we might as well start,” 
Jacobs said, taking command of 
his suit Cullen sighed audibly 
with the realization that tHe Hot 
potato Had just changed Hands 
for tKe last time tHat nigKt. Any- 
thing went wrong after this, Ja- 
cobs would carry the blame. 
“What first Phil?” 

Jacobs put His eye to one of tKe 
liny lenses, surveyed the wide 
panorama it gave him. “We can’t 
90 



wfieel tfie sfiield up to tfie front 
door, WHen we get directly undei; 
Him, He could just sKoot down 
and pick us off. CTfie door is 
closed. I suspect if may also be 
locked. We migfit all get cut down 
trying to blow it.” 

“Now what?” 

Jacobs kept His eye to tfie lens. 
THe illusion of a rain-soaked, 
empty midway still clung to him. 
The yellow light gleamed starkly 
on the black street. For a mo- 
ment, He thought He could see the 
carrousel with its garishly paint- 
ed Horses. Perched on the shoul- 
ders of the grinning beast was a 
small, dark-Haired boy. Kenny, 
He whispered. And the illusion 
sHattered, melted back into the 
light-rimmed puddles. “Call back 
to the first barricade for a demo- 
lition packet. We’ll move this 
barrier along to the side of the 
building. There is bound to be 
another doorway. We’ll blast our 
way in and go up and take him.” 

C ullen looked dubious. But Hav- 
ing no plan to offer, he called 
the barricade officer and request- 
ed a demolition packet. Ten min- 
utes later, the suitcase came spin- 
ning across the street in their di- 
rection. It slid behind the front 
barrier, right into Cullen’s hands. 

Jacobs unlatched it, checked 
out the contents. Everything was 
there. “Okay,” fie said, biting liis 
lip for a second as if to convince 

GALAXY 



himself that Ke was in a real sit- 
uation and not a dream. “Let’s 
start rolling tHe wall. Over tlier& 
Bring it around flusS witH that 
comer, then beat it into tfie al- 
le5Tway and find a door. We can’t 
waste time. If we do, it may be 
waiting on the other side of the 
door when we open it.” 

When the detonator blew, the 
door was ripped from its hinges 
and propelled across the alley, 
clattering against the opposite 
wall, bouncing back and forth 
finally settling to the pavement, 
like a spinning penny eventually 
teeters to the top of the game 
table. 

Jacobs led the others into the 
building. Holding his breath 
through the thick, acrid smoke, 
careful not to touch the steaming 
metal of the door frame. Inside, 
he ordered Officer Talmadge and 
Officer Cork to carry their flash- 
lamps on half beam. When Cork 
finally fumbled his lamp on and 
Talmadge augmented it with his, 
they found they were indeed in a 
storage room. Moments later, 
they found the doorway into the 
rest of the building. It was lock- 
ed, but flimsy. There was no need 
for explosives. Jacobs braced him- 
self against the frame, smashed a 
foot into it. Twice. Again. Four 
times. The wood splintered 
around the hinges. He kicked it 
again. The door tore free, swung 
aside.. 

KILLERBOT 



“Tenth floor,” Cullen said. 

“My brother-in-law works 
here,” Talmadge said. “I’ve been 
Here a few times.” 

“Lead then,” Jacobs said. 

Holding his lamp up to shoul- 
der level like a trembling child 
investigating a Haunted house, fie 
moved forward, tfie rest strung 
out behind Him, guns drawn. 

“Not the elevator,” Jacobs Hiss- 
ed as they threaded their way 
down a dark hall. “That will tell 
it where we are.” 

“The stairs are tliis way,” Tal- 
madge said, turning right into a 
side corridor and stopping. “May- 
be we should put lights at qxiarter 
power, Captain,” 

“Quarter power, then,” He snap- 
ped. 

The light receded. Darkness 
drifted closer. 

Quietly, quietly, they ascended 
the stairs. They must make no 
sound now. If this killerbot could 
reason and act in logical, strategic 
form, it was a newer, more dan- 
gerous killerbot. It would know 
they had broken in. It would not 
be blindly firing at an empty 
street. It would be hunting for 
them. 

He shivered. It would be bunt- 
ing for them. 

Although they expected to 
meet it at every landing, around 
every corner in the staircase, they 
climbed the twenty flights with- 
out incident. At the tenth floor, 

91 



Talmadge pusKed open tKe dou- 
ble glass doors into the main hall- 
way . 

. and was torn up tlie middle 
by fifty or more darts. 

He didn’t even have time to 
scream. 

Swallowing hard, Jacobs blast- 
ed the door, rolled through the 
gaping hole where the door had 
been, gun out and firing to the 
left. Frag slugs whined off the 
walls, shattered windows at the 
far end of the corridor. But they 
didn’t bring down the killerbot, 
for the killerbot had disappeared. 

J acobs was so tense that it seem- 
ed his scalp would split open, his 
skull crack to let out the pressure 
his whirling mind was accumulat- 
ing. And he knew that if he was 
that tense the rest of them were 
even closer to blowing their tops. 
They had never had any experi- 
ence with a killerbot that tried to 
protect itself. From the first day 
that Euro had turned killerbots 
loose on Nortamer, they had been 
stupid, suicidal units that stood 
and fired until cut down them- 
selves. Or until their weapons 
systems ran out of ammunition. 
They were not detectable, even 
by X-ray, for what metal they 
did contain in their flesh was 
shielded in silicone, plastic, nylon 
mesh that effectively rendered 
X-ray useless. They had many ad- 
vantages as weapons of war, but 
92 



they didn’t have real intelligence. 
It had always been a matter of 
standing out of the programmed 
fire pattern and cutting the hu- 
man-machine to pieces. This one 
was different, and this one seem- 
ed the turning point of the war. 

They had searched all rooms 
in this wing, their fingers aching 
with the weight of their guns, 
their eyes weary with squinting, 
blmrred with trying to sort out 
the shadows ahead and make 
them resolve into a human form, 
something, anything to shoot at. 
They turned the comer into an- 
other corridor, stepping into tlie 
kUlerbot’s line of fire. 

Officer Cork screamed a gur- 
gling scream, pitched forward, 
his head prickled with thorns as 
if he had just fought his way 
through a garden of live and vi- 
cious roses. Officer Drennings did 
not have a chance to scream; tire 
darts tore out his throat first. 

“Fall back!’’ Jacobs shouted. 

He slipped into the safe corri- 
dor. If the killerbot tried to come 
around, he would blast it open in 
a second. Cullen and Minter were 
beside him, panting. “God,” Min- 
ter was saying over and over. 
Over and over, low and soft and 
meaninglessly. 

It is hunting for us, Jacobs 
thought. 

Their lamps had been smashed 
by darts. There was only dark- 
ness now, tliick and all pervading. 

GALAXY 



Their eyes were used to the 
gloom, somewhat, but everywhere 
there were dense shadows that 
seemed to move. 

The hall was quiet. 

To hell with this pessimism! 
They were three, well-trained 
police officers. That killerbot, no 
matter how advanced, was only 
one. Numerically, they had it 
cornered. They just had to move 
with more caution, stop blunder- 
ing around as if it were a normal 
killerbot; “Come on,” he whis- 
pered to Cullen and Minter. “And 
be careful.” 

They edged around into the 
corridor. The two bodies were 
there, lying in black pools of 
blood. 

But the Idllerbot was gone. 

“We’ll never find him,” Cul- 
len said. “It will take more men.” 

Jacobs hushed him, surveyed 
the corridor. For a moment, he 
couldn’t understand what his 
eyes were trying to tell him. Then 
it registered. “No. We have him 
cornered.” 

“What — ” 

“There aren’t any stairs or ele- 
vators in this corridor,” Jacobs 
said, pointing to the four doors 
on each side. “Just those eight 
rooms. He has to be in one of 
them.” 

Cautiously, quietly, they moved 
down the hall, checking the rooms 
on both sides. Jacobs stood to the 
side, flung the portal wide, and 
KILLERBOT 



jerked his arm back as Minter 
fired a burst of frag slugs into 
the darkened room. Then, just as 
cautiously, they would flip on 
the light and scan it. When Ja- 
cobs threw open the fifth door, 
Minter fired another burst — 
and was answered with a round 
that smashed his chest apart. 

Two to one. The odds were still 
in their favor. 

Jacobs wished he had not left 
the suitcase of explosives in the 
storage room. A ball of contact 
jelly would be just the thing now. 
But tliey didn’t have it, so no 
use wishing. He looked across the 
doorway to where Cullen waited 
on the other side, face drawn and 
white. He pantomimed his inten- 
tions, shook off Cullen’s gestured 
disapproval. Gun clutched firm in 
his right hand, he bent dov,/n, 
leaned to his side, arid rolled 
through the doorway into the 
darkened room. 

T7rag shells splintered the door- 
-*• way behind hhn. 

He had come to rest against a 
heavy desk, his shoulder stinging 
with the impact. From the flash 
of the killerbot’s frag pistol, he 
knew it was on the other side of 
the desk. Holding his breath so 
that his panting would not give 
away his position, he placed the 
barrel of the pistol against the 
front of the desk, depressed the 
trigger and held it down untU 

93 



tfie clip Had emptied itself, more 
tKaa two dozen frag slugs s&ed- 
ding througK tliedesk, ripping out 
and into the IdllerBot crouclied on 
the other side. 

There were screams. 

That didn’t fit either. Killerhots 
never screamed. 

Cullen hit the lights. 

The room seemed to flare as if 
the walls had been set afire. There 
was little left of tfie desk. The 
center had been chewed away by 
the bullets, and both halves had 
caved inward, the broken top now 
forming a vee whose point rested 
on the floor.' Carefully, Jacobs 
got to his feet, his empty pistol 
clamped in his hand, only a talis- 
man now that its ammunition 
had been expended. He walked 
around the desk, kicked away 
some larger chunks of wood. 

The killerbot was approximate- 
ly forty years old. Black hair. 
Fair-skinned. And. And what? 
Something was wrong, but Ja- 
cobs could not decide quite what. 
He inspected the wounds. A doz- 
en scraps of metal had punctured 
the corpse. The holes they made 
welled thick blood. Splinters of 
wood prickled the body. To one 
side of the head lay a dartgun. 

A dartgun. 

He stared at the thing for long, 
long seconds, unwilling to believe 
it — to even comprehend it. 

“Phil, look at this,'” Cullen 
said, shoving a frag slug clip and 
94 



a pistol into Captain’s hands. 

‘“Help me strip him,” Jacobs 
said suddenly, laying the pistol 
and clip on the floor. 

“Huh?” 

“Come on.” 

Jacobs bent to the corpse, 
hands trembling as he and Cullen 
peeled away the bloody garments. 
As he had suspected, the body 
bore no scars from weapon im- 
plantation. There were only the 
gashes of the frag slugs from Ja- 
cobs’ own gun — and the wounds 
of wood splinters from tlie shat- 
tered desk. 

“He wasn’t a killerbot,” Cullen 
said, his eyes too wide, his mouth 
Hanging too far open. 

“He was just a man,” Jacobs 
agreed. 

“But why?” 

CCT — I think maybe I see it. 

* The psych boys may be more 
detailed — ” 

“What?” Cullen shifted his 
weight from one foot to the othd:, 
coughed. 

Jacobs couldn’t take his eyes 
from the hands of the corpse, the 
hands that had Held the throb- 
bing guns. “We were in war with 
Euro. A normal war — if any 
wars are normal. Then Euro 
command changed the character 
of armed conflict. They came up 
with tlie killerbots. The enemy 
could be living next door now, 
waiting. Life took on a fluid, un- 

GALAXY 



stable quality.” He looked to tHe 
Eands, could not take bis eye§ 
from tSe trigger fingers. 

Cullen cougbed. 

“Our government played tKe 
game too. Nortamer took its 
criminals, political prisoners, and 
outcasts, made tHem into our own 
Idllerbots. BotH sides admitted 
tKat Human life was unimportant 
compared to tHe robo-factories 
and towering cities. THe inani- 
mate must be preserved while tlie 
flesK died. It became a war of 
attrition. Women and children — ” 
“Women and children were not 
spared by eitfier side,” Jacobs 
continued. “THe family could 
dissolve in an instant. We became 
frustrated witH the liigH degree 
of instability of society. As we 
lost our loved ones and were 
powerless to stop tHe loss, we 
were frustrated because there was 
no one to be angry witH. The en- 
emy was amongst us; the enemy 
was us. Sooner or later — psy- 
cKosis.” 

“And tKe man Here pretended 
to be a killerbot because He could 
shirk his responsibilities and 
strike back, dump his frustration. 
But if this catches on — ” 
Jacobs shuddered. “Exactly.” 
He stood, left Cullen with the 



body, and left the Medarts build- 
ing. 

Outside, tHe rain was still fall- 
ing, tHe fog tKicker tfian ever. Af 
tfie first barricade. He sent tfie 
psycfi boys up to tfie tenth floor.; 
As fie was crawling into his car, 
Burtrum, Captain of tHe Westside 
Sector pulled His car alongside. 

“It’s over,” Jacobs said. 

“Strangest thing tonight,” Bur- 
trum said, leaning out of the win- 
dow, his hair plastered to Kis 
Head. “We brought down two kil- 
lerbots over near tHe sports arena, 
but they — ” 

“Weren’t really Idllerbots,” 
Jacobs finisfied. 

“How’d you Hear?” 

“We just had tfie same thing.” 

“Gives me the shivers. Wonder 
wfiat the psych boys will find 
out?” 

Jacobs shrugged, started the 
car, and pulled out, sweeping in a 
U-turn and heading down Syca- 
more Avenue toward the ramp of 
the autoway. His mind boiled. 
When frustrations reached an un- 
bearable limit, when family could 
be dissolved in a Hail of bullets 
at any moment, the human mind 
rebelled against responsibility. 
Men took a Holiday, indulged in 
a season for freedom — freedom

anything. And now it had begun. 
He didn’t want to think about 
where and when it might end. 

The autoway lay ahead. He 
punched the key for an extended

Again, the gray rain was pep-

rolled end over end along the au-

crimson and amber waves. The 
flames on the wet pavement re-

lAX VALSER AND THE 
ROCKET - PROPELLED 
AIRPLANE 

■precisely forty years ago, in the 
early summer of 1929, I met 
Max Valier, the then most popu- 
lar “rocket man,” for the first 
time. It was not a chance meet- 
ing, we had had same casual cor- 
respondence for a number of 
years. But while it was not a 
chance meeting, it was a hurried 



97 



one because Max Valier was on 
a lecture tour and bad just two 
hours between trains in Berlin. 
We met — aroimd ten o’clock in 
the morning — in a coffee house 
in the Friedrich Strasse. The 
building does not exist anymore, 
but it was near one of the present 
checkpoints between East and 
West Berlin. 

After greeting me, Valier open- 
ed the conversation with the 
words: “If we Have an elevator 
that rises at a uniform rate, what 
are the g-forces on the people in- 
side? How would you calculate 
that?” I could only answer truth- 
fully that I had never given a 
thought to that problem — and 
after we had parted I wondered 
what had prompted that particu- 
lar question. Now I know, be- 
cause a biography of Max Valier, 
just published in West Germany, 
mentions that he and his friend, 
the writer Otto Willi Gail, had 
had many discussions about that 
point. I suspect that they made it 
more complicated as the discus- 
sion progressed. 

Reading that biography natur- 
ally made me remember many 
things I had not thought about 
for decades and since the book 
contains much impublished corre- 
spondence it also cleared up a 
number of points about which I 
had known little or nothing. 

To begin at the beginning, Max 
Valier was born in Bozen in the 
98 



province of Tyrol, then a part 
of Austria, on February 9, 1895. 
His family had moved there fromj 
southwest Germany two genera- 
tions earlier; they were bakers by, 
profession. And for some reason 
they began to spell their name 
with a V instead of the original 
F. Of course this had the result 
that it looked like a French name 
and everybody pronoimced it as 
if it were a French word. Max Va-< 
lier, in the early years of his fame, 
still tried to correct people and 
get them to pronoimce it fah- 
LEAR as it had been pronounced 
originally. But he soon gave up; 
the written word proved to be 
more powerful than the spoken 
word. 

At the age of fifteen his whole 
future career was decided by a 
chance discussion with his moth- 
er’s parents. Years earlier a friend 
of the family had been in financial 
difficulties, had borrowed some 
money and had left two small 
telescopes as security. The money 
had never been repaid and the 
two telescopes (one a 1-inch, the 
other a lj4-inch) had gathered 
dust. High School pupil Max had 
just had a few lessons in optics 
as part of the physics course. He 
took the telescopes apart, cleaned 
eversdhing up and built moimt- 
ings for them. He began observing 
and was most serious about it; he 
was especially Happy if he suc- 
ceeded in seeing the satellites of 

GALAXY 



Jupiter. Tlien lie bougKt himself a 
few astronomical books and, as a 
sideline, apprenticed himself to a 
local precision mechanic in order 
to be able to build instruments 
himself. He kept an astronomical 
diary, wrote poems (in German 
and in Latin) and tried to write 
a drama. 

Then came the first world war. 

A fter basic training Valier man- 
aged to be assigned to the 
meteorological section; it was his 
private boast that he managed to 
get through the whole war with- 
out ever firing a shot. But some of 
the meteorological work was done 
from airplanes and Valier had the 
ambiton to become an aviator. 
Circumstances combined against 
this!; he never acquired a pilot’s 
license even though the newspa- 
pers later on spoke of him as “the 
aviator Valier.” He did survive 
an airplane crash with only a few 
cracked ribs, but He had not been 
the pilot. 

The fact tliat He had written 
a small book on watching the 
ptars for soldiers somehow 
brought him in touch with the Vi- 
eimese engineer Hanns Hoerbiger, 
head of a prosperous engineering 
firm and inventor of a “new vision 
of the universe.” It was the 
infamous “glacial cosmogony”, 
in German Welteislehre, which 
thought that it could explain any- 
thing and everything by the ap-

sumption that roughly half of 
the universe consisted of ice and 
the other half of hot matter, like 
stars. Scientists knew that all tliis 
was far too glib and based on un- 
provable and improbable assump- 
tions, but to the layman it sound- 
ed quite convincing. It sounded 
especially convincing because it 
“explained” things which scien- 
tists admitted they cotild not, or 
not yet, explain. Max Valier, al- 
ways enthusiastic, not only found 
himself a convert to the new con- 
cepts, he decided to become a 
fighter for the “truth” and or- 
ganized a long course of lectures

Welteislehre was the proper way 
to looh at nature, he chanced 
across another book. It was Her- 
mann Oberth’s first publication, 
The Rocket Into Interplanetary 
Space. Valier was enthusiastic 
about the concept of space rockets 
too, and soon wrote long letters — 
minimum : seven pages single- 
spaced — to Professor Oberth’. 
Oberth answered at equal length; 
any innovator is happy to find in- 
terested pupils. Valier worked on 
two books simultaneously; one 
was a popularization of Oberth’s 
book on space rockets which was 
too heavily mathematical to be 
read by the public. The other was 
a large popular astronomy in- 
tended to convince everybody 
about the truth of the Welteis-^ 
lehre. 

Then there began a tug of war, 
two innovators fighting for the 
sole and exclusive allegiance of a 
promising pupil. Hoerbiger was 
opposed to space travel; he once 
wrote me that “the reaction of 
mere exhaust gases cannot move a 
vessel in space” and said about 
Oberth’s mathematical proof 
“calculations can only lead you 
astray.” This would be a strange 
remark coming from almost any- 
one; coming from a graduate and 
professional engineer it was plain- 
ly incredible. Since I believed in 
calculations (and knew far more 

GALAXY 



about fossils tKan Hoerbiger wfio 
“explained” them, too) our cor- 
respondence was terminated rath- 
er abruptly. 

T ralier also believed in calcula- 
tions, Oberth’s calculations 
in this case, but Ke was not Hoping 
for space travel for the sake of 
space travel, Ke had another 
thought in his mind which he re- 
vealed in a letter to ObertK, writ- 
ten Febraury 10, 1924, a few 
months after the publication of 
Oberth’s book: 

“I consider it tragic that you 
build hopes on points which I 
consider hopeless while you re- 
ject what I consider the most im- 
portant thing. You hope for com- 
mercial advantages from the con- 
struction of a large space mirror 
(provided that it can be built at 
all), you are looking forward to 
utilizing the metal of iron mete- 
orites on the moon’s surface and 
you hope that we might cool off 
Venus and make it habitable. All 
this I cannot believe, but you fail 
to consider something else which 
seems to me to be far more impor- 
tant. You are basing everything 
on astronomical ideas which I be- 
lieve to be obsolete, for I am one 
of the advocates of Hoerbiger’s 
Welteislehre . Please consider: 
Hoerbiger claims that the moon 
is completely covered with ice, 
that everything we see on the 
moon, craters, mountains, etc. 

FOR YOUR INFOR/AATION 



consists of ice and of ice only. 
Hoerbiger also says that all the 
planets, with the sole exception of 
the earth, are covered with layers 
of ice, even Mercury and Venus 
in spite of their proximity to the 
sun (it can easily be proved 
mathematically that the sun 
could not melt ice even on Mer- 
cury, provided only that Mercury 
has no atmosphere). This means 
that the moon is the crown wit- 
ness and the touchstone for Hoer- 
biger’s ideas. You will understand 
what it must mean for Hoerbig- 
er’s followers to set foot on the 
moon. If it turns out that the 
moon does not consist of ice, we 
are beaten and every thing is lost. 
But if the surface of the moon 
is ice then everything has been 
won and astronomy, astrophysics, 
meteorology and geology have 
been proved wrong. This is wKat 
prompts me to help you further 
your invention with everything I 
can do . Moreover there is some 
urgency. The master of the new 
knowledge has turned 65 today; 
it is our dearest desire that the 
flight to the moon be carried out 
while he is still alive. ...” 

But the “master” did not think 
one could get to the moon. 

At one time he must have spok- 
en to Valier about this, because 
a few years ater Valier complain- 
ed in a letter to me that “the Wel- 
teis people are mad at me because 
I am interested in space travel, 

161 



while others reject me as a rocket 
expert because I became involved 
with the Welteislehre.” 

By the time fie wrote tfiis it 
fiad became clear to Kim tfiat 
scientists would not accept Hoer- 
biger’s idea but that they might 
(with many reservations) consid- 
er the possibility of space travel. 

Tt would fiave been logical to as- 
sume tfiat Valier, wfio fiad 
once devoted Himself to preacfiing 
(there is no otlier word) Hoerbig- 
er’s ideas, would not advocate 
Oberth’s space rockets and space- 
ships wfiolefieartedly. Tfiat would 
have been a logical asstimption, 
but by 1929 Obertfi and Valier 
were no longer on speaking terms. 
This was due to VaUer’s insistence 
tfiat “tfie spaceship sKould be de- 
veloped gradually by successive 
modifications of existing air- 
planes.” 

The reason behind this reason- 
ing was the searcK for money. 

Obertfi, who by then fiad de- 
voted fifteen years of his life to 
rocket theory, had a straight line 
of development in mind. He also 
underestimated the cost of this 
development to a fantastic extent. 
First one had to create a well- 
working rocket motors; this would 
cost .about $500. Then one would 
build sounding rockets capable 
of carrying scientific instruments 
to altitudes of about 30 miles. 
Tfiis would cost somewfiere be- 
102 



tween $2000 and $5000. After that 
fiad been done, tfie first spaceship, 
capable of carrsnng two people 
beyond tfie atmosphere, could be 
built for about $50,000! So tfie 
problem was to find somebody, or 
an institution, tfiat was able and 
willing to spend sucfi amounts for 
tfie sake of science. 

Valier knew that tfiese figures 
were far too low and tided to find 
a way to develop rockets in sucfi 
a manner that tfieir very develop- 
ment would produce an income. 
At tfie time the most modem pas- 
senger airplane, witfi a cruising 
speed of about 110 miles per hour, 
was tfie G-23 developed by Pro- 
fessor Fluge Junkers. Junkers fiad 
been the first to build airplanes 
of metal exclusively — no canvas, 
no bamboo, no wooden window 
frames. Everytfiing was supposed 
to be of metal. “Even the seat 
cushions?” a newspaperman is 
supposed to have asked after tfie 
lecture preceding tfie demonstra- 
tions. Junkers smiled and said 
that cushions were cushions and 
tfiat his window curtains also 
were still curtains, tfiougfi fie in- 
tended to Have tliem made of fi- 
berglass. 

Now tfie G-23 fiad tfiree en- 
gines, one in tfie fuselage and one 
in eacfi wing. Valier suggested re- 
placement of tfie two wing en- 
gines, by rocket motors for a fast 
take-off; tfie cruising could then 
be done witfi tfie propeller of tfie 

GALAXY 



center engine once cruising alti- 
tude had been reached. ObertH 
pointed out that the efficiency of 
a rocket would be very poor un- 
less the airplane moved at a speed 
close to the velocity of the ex- 
haust of the rocket. Valier replied 
that low efficiency did not mat- 
ter if one could do something in 
that manner that could not be 
done at all otherwise. Oberth re- 
plied that a fast-flying airplane 
would have to have thin wings; 
Valier answered that just the 
thick wings of the Junkers air- 
planes were useful because one 
could put the fuel tanks inside 
the wings. ObertH countered by 
paying that even yard-thick wingp 
would not be voluminous enough 
to hold the fuel the rockets woiold 
swallow in a few minutes of 
operation. 

Obertii Had naturally figured it 
put carefully. 

But Valier continued to develop, 
his line of reasoning. The next 
type would have one additional 
rocket motor in each wing; be- 
cause it would fly faster, the wings 
could be shorter. The one after 
that would have three rocket mo- 
tors in each wing, no longer use 
a propeller, and would need a 
pressurized cabin because it would 
cruise at about 30,000 feet with 
speeds ranging from 35 to 60Q 
miles per hour. After that there 
would be a wingless typei the 
spaceship. 

FOR YOUR INFORA/VATION 



^^o modem readers a few of 
these figures sound familiar; 
passenger jets cruise at 30,000 feet 
with a cruising speed of around 
600 miles per hours. But they Have 
thin wings and their engines of 
course, are jet engines, not rocket 
engines. 

Now, after three decades after 
Valier’s death it turns out that he 
did not always mean “rocket” 



* ■ * 

Valier's "}ntermec!iate typos" In his scheme 
to transform an airplane into a spaceship. 
Type 1 still has a propeller and two 
"rockets"; Type 2 is the same with two 
more "rockets" added. Type 3 dispenses 
with the propeller and type 4 is the space- 
ship, all seen from the back, with tail 
assembly and landing gear omitted. 




TYPES, 





when he said so. The “intermedi- 
ate types” he proposed were to be 
propelled by an engine that used 
a liquid rocket fuel but took the 
necessary oxygen from the at- 
mosphere. This, by definition, is 
a jet engine, though one must not 
think of modem jet engines when 
hearing the word. Valier’s scheme, 
expressed in a letter to Professor 
Oberth, with carbon copies to the 
head of the Austrian Society for 
High Altitude Research, Dr. 
Franz von Hoefft in Vienna, and 
to Dr. Walter Hohmann in Essen, 
ran as follows : In a piston engine 
we have the cycle that begins 
with the intake of air and fuel 
vapor, followed by compression 
and ignition. At the moment of 
explosion Valier wanted to have 
an exhaust valve jumping open 
so that the explosion gases would 
not spend their energy moving 
pistons, connecting rods etc., but 
produce reaction directly. Valier 
iicver had an opportunity to try 
the development of such an en- 
gine — and I have grave doubts 
whether it could have been done 
— but the fundamental idea of a 
jet engine is plainly present. 

This, of course, invalidated the 
calculations of the large amounts 
of rocket fuel and liquid oxygen 
that were cited by Oberth (and by 
me, too) against Valier’s interme- 
diate types. I did not know about 
the idea of a piston engine modi- 
fied for reaction, and Oberth’, von 
104 



Hoefft and Hohman seem to have 
forgotten about it almost immedi- 
ately. To a large extent it was 
Valier’s fault; he should have said 
“rocket” when he meant a rocket 
and invented another term for his 
airbreathing engine. I suspect that 
“rocket” almost immediately. To 
a large extent it was Valier’s fault; 
he did not want to put ideas into 
other people’s heads; during his 
lectures and in his publications he 
used the word rocket exclusively. 

Of course there were discus- 
sions with engineers of the Junk- 
ers Aircraft Company which took 
much energy and time and 
brought no fruit. Apparently the 
engineers felt that this was some- 
thing for the future and that their 
next job was simply a bigger or 
faster airplane with conventional 
engine. Professor Junkers also 
had his pet ideas;; he wanted to 
introduce Diesel engines for air- 
craft. Still, a few years after these 
discussions. Junkers equipped two 
of his smaller one-engine aircraft 
with batteries of solid fuel rockets 
to see whether rockets could be 
used as take-off help. The experi- 
ment was a success, but it was 
not followed up for about a dec- 
ade — Professor Junkers died in 
the meantime. 

What followed then is the pe- 
riod in his life which most people 
remember when Valier’s name is 
mentioned. It was the period of 
r o c ke t-propelled automobiles, 

GALAXY 



rocket-propelled railroad cars, 
rocket-propelled sleds and a few 
attempts at rocket-propelled glid- 
ers. They made Valier’s name a 
household word, at least in Eur- 
ope. They attracted a great deal 
of attention but they did not real- 
ly accomplish anything in the 
field of engineering. Valier, whose 
main aim was to attract attention 
to rocket propulsion in general, 
also claimed that they contribu- 
ted to the improvement of solid 
fuel rockets. But since no new 
types of solid rocket fuels were 
tried, the experiments did not 
even do that. 

Qome time during this period 
one of the directors of the So- 
ciety for Space Travel (I don’t re- 
call his name, but He was an im- 
portant official in the German 
Postal Service) remarked: “If 
Valier could only keep his mouth 
sEut!” The occasion was Valier’s 
collaboration with Gottlob Es- 
penlaub, one of the German glid- 
er pioneers. Espenlaub, the first 
man to have gliders towed in 
flight by airplanes, had promised 
to build an airplane for rocket 
propulsion." The design was quite 
modern, sweptwing witK a faint 
diherdral. Valier aruiounced that 
Ee would use this airplane to fly 
the English Channel, from Dover 
to Calais, following the route of 
Louis B14riot’s historic flight. 

Then Espenlaub did not build 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



this airplane, but constructed a 
tailless glider which he flew him- 
self, using solid fuel rockets. The 
glider caught fire in midair and 
Espenlaub had to jump — with- 
out a parachute. He survived Eis 
jvunp, but suffered a severe brain 
concussion.

rockets of today. 




Finally, in DecemBer,! 1929, 
VaUer found support from Dr. 
Paul Heylandt, tKe owner of a 
plant making liquid gases. VaUer 
built a simple (uncooled) rocket 
motor of steel, weighing 9 poimds 
In January 1930 he recorded tlie 
result of test stand burnings:

Six sucK rocket motors, VaUer 
reasoned, would produce enough 
thrust to propel him across the 
EngUsH Channel. But first it was 
put into an automobile frame 
again. It worked — not well, but 
good enough for a demonstration. 
Witnesses of one demonstration 
were engineers of the Shell OU 
Corporation. They reported to the 
home office and the home office 
decided to support Valier’s devel- 
opment vrork. But there was one 
condition: Hie fuel must not be 
alcohol or somebody’s gasoline, it 
had to be Shell oil. Nobody can 
teU whether VaUer liad any pri- 
vate doubts, he accepted the con- 
dition. He did feel Hurried by 
competition. 

Hairi F. Melot in France was 
106 



said to work on rocket-propelled 
airplanes for the French army it 
was not true. A man by the name 
of Robert W. E. Lademann who 
claimed to have Robert H. God- 
dard’s confidence, told that God- 
dard was supported lavishly by 
the U.S. Army and that his rock- 
ets had reached altitudes of 60 
miles; this was even less true. A 
newspaperman by the name of 
Erich Boyer published an article 
about Friedrich Wilhelm Sander 
who Had furnished the rockets for 
Opel’s experiments with racing 
cars and railway cars. Boyer 
claimed that Sander had buUt a 
liquid fuel rocket motor that Had 
run for 48 minutes. To this day 
nobody is quite sure whether 
Sander was working in this field 
or whether Boyer, who never was 
very reUable, invented the story. 
That the Society for Space Travel 
was about to continue experi- 
ments started by Oberth was cor- 
rect, but the financial situation 
of the society was such that VaUer 
did not need to rush. Rumors 
about rocket experimentation in 
the Soviet Union were correct too, 
as is now known, but the Russians 
also took their time. 

In order to use Shell oil, Va- 
lier had to make modification. He 
added an “emulsion chamber” to 
his rocket because He intended to 
run it on a mixture of fuel and 
water. It worked a few times, but 
on May 17, 1930 — a Saturday — 

GALAXY 



the rocket motor exploded. Valier, 
who had been standing next to it 
without any protection, collapsed. 
Ten minutes later h'e was dead. 
A splinter Had severed one of the 
major arteries in His chest and 
he died of an internal Hemorrhage. 
The time was about 15 minutes 
later 9 PM. 

His body was cremated in Ber- 
lin on May 23, 1930. Professor 



ObertH and I were both present. 
THe ashes were tHen flown to 
MunicH for burial. THe City of 
Munich should erect a monument 
to him. He was not always right, 
but he was quite often too impet- 
uous, but he was always idealis- 
tic and energetic. And He sincerely 
believed in the Ships of Space 
that were to come.

Six or seven years ago Frank Herbert, until then best known as the 
author of the classic underwater sf story known variously as Under Pressure 
or 21 sf Century Sub (depending on which edition you read), began publi- 
cation of the stories which ultimately wound up in the fat science-fiction 
novel. Dune. One of the biggest sf books ever published. Done was also 
one of the most successful in carrying away awards. It won the 1965 
Nebula award from the Science Fiction Writers of America, and the 1965 
Hugo from the World Science Fiction Convention, and if it didn't win any 
others it is probably only because there were no others in its category 
to win. 

Next month Galaxy begins publication of the final story in the Dune 
cycle. It is called Dune Messiah. Complex, evocative, brilliant, it is all 
that Dune was, and maybe a little more . 

James Blish is with us next month, too, with a longish and very fine 
novelette called The City That Was the World. Suppose you were you — 
that is, someone with a burning curiosity about space and the future — 
but blessed with the wealth and independence of a Howard Hughes, the 
intelligence and technological grasp of an Einstein and an Edison com- 
bined. Suppose that you had it within your power to look Into the future, 
and change it as you would — but almost surely had to die as a result. 
That's the problem. What Blish's hero does about it is the solution. 

We've also got a new A. Bertram Chandler novelette scheduled, a 
fascinating study of the Russian proto-spaceman, Tsiolkovsky, by someone 
who knew him, the usual Budrys and Ley enjoyable columns — and more. 
See you then!

Tl /Tarty: Don’t read this; it’s in 
Old English and the spelling 
is different: “Jangling is when a 
man spekith to moch beforn folk, 
and clappith as a mille, and tafc-

Now that you’ve read it any-

that Geoffrey Chaucer wrote it in 
“The Parson’s Tale.” What he said 
was — but I needn’t translate; 
you probably had no more trou- 
ble with it than if you’d been lis- 
tening to the kind of English 



103 




disk jockeys once spoke on rock 
radio stations. 

This is a story of a Jangler 
nearly seven hundred years re- 
moved from Geoffrey’s time. It’S 
the tale of a disk jockey named 
Jabber McAbber, which he some- 
times called himself. At other 
times, at other contemporary mu- 
sic stations, as they called them- 
selves, he was known as Esoteric 
Ed, or Happy Mac, or James 
tlie First. For he moved on. He 
moved from Cincinnati to Akron 
to Chicago to Phoenix. He dream- 
ed of making the big time in New 
York but that call never came. 

Another kind of call came, 
though. It came in Phoenix, 
where he took the fancy of an ec- 
centric billionaire who owned, 
among things and people, a radio- 
television network, an advertising 
agency, a movie studio, a publish- 
ing house, a university, several 
electronics companies, a city of 
some size in the Southwest — he 
owned most of the real estate 
and enough of the politicians, one 
way or another — and a deacti- 
vated rocket base in the desert. 
You Imow the name of the bil- 
lionaire and the singleminded de- 
termination with which he went 
after anything he wanted. More 
about him later. 

Our disk jockey’s real name was 
Edward James McHenry. He was 
38 years old now and sometimes 
he had to force it. The old spon-

taneity wasn’t always iEere. TEe 
drive Had ebbed. The zing had 
zimg. 

Once die words Kad tumbled 
out, more of them than he could 
articulate, but now it took an 
effort to make them flow. His 
delivery was more deliberate, not 
rehearsed, but thought out. 

It comforted him to know his 
plight was not unique. A writer 
had told him of times when it 
took a monumental effort to roll 
a sheet of paper into the type- 
writer. He'd known artists who’d 
said similar. He’d known poets, 
too, and peasants . 

“Oh, yes! I’ve known poets and 
peasants, and pallbearers and 
priests. And princes crossed my 
path, or I theirs, in foreign climes 
and on native shores, for princes 
travel. And I’ve known princesses 
— native born like Grace K. Rai- 
nier and Rita H. Kahn — and 
those of alien corn like Elizabeth 
and Margaret, not to mention 
whatsername and whoozis. 

“But I’ve strayed from my 
theme, which is music, so I’ll get 
off and spin a record, as we used 
to say before tape. Spin with me, 
won’t you?, as we enjoy the 
sounds of the Jefferson Airplane.” 

Two minutes and forty seconds 
later he was on again. He’d pre- 
pared for the end of the music. 
In the old days it would have 
been off the cuff, off the top of 
the head, off the world.;

“Wasn’t that the most? Where 
can you go from there, except 
elsewhere? And so we spin you 
on, you spinnable people, to the 
obligatory scene, if you remember 
Drama 201 — we spin you, I say, 
to this word from our sponsor — 
this important announcement: 

“Friends! Fellow human be- 
ings! Mortals like me! Are you 
troubled with irregularity? ...” 

He went on too long, unneces- 
sarily identifying, stretching it 
out. 

You may have wondered who’s 
been talking here, besides Ed. 
I mean words don’t come out of a 
void, especially when they’re not 
Ed’s words and Ed’s the last man 
alive. 

I’ve been talking. Me, Marty. 
I’m a machine. That’s what the 
first letter of my acronym stands 
for. My full name is Machine Am- 
plifying Rationalizations Treat- 
ing of Yore. Or maybe it’s Ma- 
chine Assessing Reality as Told 
to You. It doesn’t matter. The 
acronym-makers are long gone. 
I realize that as a machine I 
should be positive. I shouldn’t tell 
you different things, or varia- 
tions of the same thing, and clahri 
there’s no real difference. To do 
this is to be guilty of what some- 
body called terminological inex- 
actitude. I think the somebody 
was Winston Churchill. Of course 
I don’t really mean I really think. 
That would be a lie and it would 
110 



not do to have a machine capable 
of lying. Especially since one of 
my functions is to amend, correct, 
edit, amplify and otherwise make 
more meaningful for posterity the 
mouthings of Esoteric Ed. But 
first let’s listen some more to Ed. 



^ Sometimes I tell different 
stories, up here in the lonely. I 
make up alternate pasts for my- 
self. I use different names for my 
different pasts, for my different 
moods. 

Some days I’m Gaylord Guig- 
nol, sole survivor of a destroyed 
world and devil-may-care chron- 
icler of its last agony. Except that 
I do care; my nonchalance dis- 
guises the deep hurt I felt, arid 
feel, at the death of Earth. 

Sometimes I’m Hank Hardcas- 
tle, steely-eyed hero of a thou- 
sand thrilling adventures, scion of 
a near-noble family. 

Other times I’m Harry Protag- 
onist, space disk jockey, who’s 
been set whirling in tlie void on 
an unfathomable mission. I need 
to communicate my fears, hopes, 
fantasies £md, above all, my puz- 
zlement, to my imagined listeners. 

Sometimes I forget who I real- 
ly am. A person can tamper just 
so long with what he is, pretend- 
ing to be another, before he be- 
comes, to some extent, one of 
those other selves. Then his owit 
self is lost, or blurred. Too much 

GALAXY 



blurring is bad. It’s desirable 
sometimes to hide from one’s self, 
to pretend, to merge the ego into 
a fantasy personality, to live or 
dream vicariously, but I may be 
overdoing it. 

Who am I really? Does it mat- 
ter as long as I get through tlie 
day? I owe myself and you my 
listeners that much. It is my duty 
to you and to myself. But a cer- 
tain tranquility is needed to reach 
the end of the day. Some achieved 
this by natural talent, by their 
very vivaciousness or stick-to-it- 
iveness. Doggedly they breathed 
in and out and took sustenance 
from time to time and went to the 
bathroom to rid themselves of 
the residue of previous susten- 
ance-takings, and did a little 
work, and lo, it was a new day. 
Some never achieved the new day. 
They funked it. They flunked 
out Others got there, though, by 
drink or drugs or pot. I speak of 
back then, you, understand, be- 
fore the now. You may have no- 
ticed that I’m not always lucid, 
though once in a night club I 
was Larry Lucid, explainer of 
contemporary society to those less 
informed. But I coped. I used 
music. I always had something 
on, either on the hi-fi or the radio. 
I used to bounce through the day 
on a big beat that included me 
in because it just naturally as- 
sumed that everybody was a part 
of it and approved and throbbed 
112 



along with it and so I was one 
with all that went on. But that 
was long ago and now I’m part 
of nothing because nothing is go- 
ing on. 

The only tiung that goes on is 
what I make happen and even 
that may not be real. 

They’ve done something to me. 
I feel banded, like a Canadian 
duck. I don’t have a circlet 
around wrist or ankle but I know 
something’s got me somewhere. 
Maybe I’ve been implanted — 
I’ve already been tapped and 
bugged. 

I read once that some ornithol- 
ogists had attached a radio to a 
condor to find out how far it 
went for food, or to rest, or what- 
ever condors do to get by. 

I didn’t find out whether the 
condor knew it’d been bugged. 
But I know something’s been done 
to me and I resent it. I don’t 
mind doing my bit for science; 
but if they’ve tampered with my 
human dignity, if they’ve psyched 
me in the psyche . 



This is Marty again. I’ll tell 
you more about the man who 
put our hero up here. His name 
was John Potter Parnell and, be- 
cause he was a sanitary facilities 
manufacturer, he was known as 
Potty, or John. Sometimes he was 
called Young Potty, to dis- 
tinguish him from his father, 

GALAXY 



also known as Potty and to a few 
intimates as Poopy. Young Potty, 
at 50, was still in his father’s 
shadow. 

The old man had founded the 
business and made the original 
millions. Hy-G-Enic, Inc., manu- 
factured most of the country’s 
and later the world’s toilets, urin- 
als, sinks, towel racks and dis- 
pensers of sanitary and prophy- 
lactic devices. The millions and 
then the billions poured in at 
such a rate that, when Poopy re- 
tired, Potty could have sat back 
and let inertia provide opulently 
for him and all his heirs. But Pot- 
ty — he really preferred John — 
had come late to the presidency 
and wasn’t content to let Hy-G- 
Enic expand at a safe, sure rate. 
He established a foundation that 
awarded grants for research. He 
set up an experimental division, 
hired scientists and turned them 
loose to work at their own pace 
and let him know when they’d 
got something. He sponsored a 
competition to design a better 
bidet. He sent engineers to Wash- 
ington to see what Hy-G-Enic 
could do in the space program. 

It was Potty’s emissaries to 
NASA who led to the hiring of 
Ed. They got him from a subsid- 
iary company, Arizona Airtalk, 
for which he’d been broadcasting 
as Jim McHenry, Jock of the 
Desert. The Jock’s music-talk 
show was the despair of competi-

tors in the rock radio game. 

We’ll come back to Ed. Here’s 
some information about me ■ — 
Marty the machine. It’s not as if 
I’m a machine, singular. I’m the 
end product of many machines, so- 
phisticated and otherwise. I know 
everything they know because 
I’m the synthesis, the reincarna- 
tion of all of them. 

Let me answer your other un- 
spoken question, whoever you 
are: Why don’t I sound like a 
machine? How come I come on 
colloquial instead of respectfully, 
as befits the man-machine rela- 
tionship? Like: “You master, me 
robot.” Or solemnly, like: “The 
data you have requisitioned are 
stored in circuits in Subtank 
4739C of my vast interconnected 
memory banks. There will be an 
unavoidable delay while the nec- 
essary hookups are made to re- 
trieve this rarely-requested ma- 
terial.” 

Nuts. Everything I have is 
yours — whoever, wherever and 
whenever you are — instantly. 
Sometimes you don’t even have 
to ask. This whole ship is my 
memory circuit. I extend into ev- 
ery nook — even to places Ed 
prefers not to think about, like 
the reconstitution unit. You might 
almost say I am the ship, but that 
would be an exaggeration, and 
immodest. 

If you still think I sound more 
Human than mechanical, it’s only 

113 



natural. Hell, I was made by Hu- 
man beings. How else sHould I 
talk? Like Mowgli’s wolves on 
Tarzan’s apes? MacHines talk 
good. Like colloquial. MacHineg 
have been talking for generations. 
Ask Victor,

I Have tiSis reluctance to eaf

Old chin ain’t double. No dew-

a pretty good specimen by any 
standards and I guess it’s because 
I’m abstemious. I don’t eat mucH

bought a used Oriental rug, but 
I’d have drawn the line at used 
food. My folks talked sometimes 
about the Depression and told 
about tEe cheap things tliey ate, 
but at least they’d been the first 
to eat them. They came out of 
those bad times strong and proud^ 
I sit down to dinner with as much 
pleasure as an explorer at a can-

hSat Has already passed at least 
once tHrougK the alimentary ca- 
nal. And there’s no comfort ifl 
knowing it’s no foreign waterway 
that’s been navigated — it’s my 
own, my native gland. It’s ani 
affront to the system. Except it’s 
not tHe system that’s outraged. 
The body can take it; it’s the im- 
agination that revolts. It’s got tKis 
way of exaggerating to the point 
where you say never mind wKat 
the facts are, things ought to be 
different. 

jlfarfy: 

I Have to defend the recon- 
stitution works against Ed’s slan- 
der. After all, it’s a fellow ma- 
chine. What comes out of it goes 
back into Ed perfectly clean. It’s 
cleaner than wHat He got in those 
fancy restaurants He enjoyed and 
a damn sight more sanitary and 
nutritious than tHe weird meals 
He cooked for himself in his va- 
rious bachelor apartments. 

Excuse the digression. I had to 
get it out of my system, as Ed 
was getting it out of His. If these 
notes are published, by some fu- 
ture cHronicler, some poor M.A. 
desperate for a new subject for 
his doctoral dissertation, they 
could be titled just that — “Get- 
ting It Out of His System.” Ed’s 
trouble is that whatever he gets 
out goes back in. His only irre- 
versible catharsis i§ verbal. Oil 
do I mean oral?

WHat I’m trying to do is write 
a story witli no cooperation front 
my subject. I’m not a trained 
writer but I appreciate tKe dif- 
ficulties. Of course I’m not writ- 
ing in tbe strict sense. No Hands, 
you know. So I do wKat He does 
— talk — and tKe words are put 
down, for posterity? Or put up, 
as preserves are? It’s a kind of 
automatic writing, without slates; 
certainly without sleight of Hand. 
If I write, or talk, too mucfi, put 
it down, or up, to my inexperi- 
ence. First one writes, then He 
edits. I couldn’t really be expect- 
ed to know very mucH, consist- 
ing as I do mostly of a buncH of 
circuits in and near tKe hull of 
this experimental capsule of Pot- 
ty Parnell’s. My job is to store 
away — preserve — Ed’s mean-< 
dering mind, or as mucH of it as 
He reveals tHrougH liis on-mike 
^monologues, plus as mucK more 
as can be vouchsafed by a ma- 
chine. They Had to trust to a 
machine because nobody else was 
going up here witH Ed. And no- 
body did. 

My knowledge of Ed was gather- 
ed piece by piece as people fed into 
my predecessor machines Infor- 
Jnation provided by interviews 
with Hundreds of people wKo’d 
known Ed and talked about him; 
before Potty gave him his job. 
There is also the information pro- 
vided by Ed himself, both in di- 
rect interviews and during some

swallowed a miniaturized trans- 
mitter imbedded in a raw oyster; 
and it lasted rmtil it Had passed 
tHrougH Ed’s system. It wasn’t as 
messy as it might seem. Ed 
was Potty’s week-long House 
guest and aU tKe bathrooms 
were part of Hy-G-Enics ex-

and it was mere routine to re-

Ufarty: 

This is really not bad. I 
didn’t think our untutored sub- 
ject had it in him to make that 
double-barreled allusion to Potty 
Parnell’s business and Elizabeth 
Barrett Browning’s dog. 

There are times when I have 
more than a grudging admiration 
for Harry Protagonist or James 
the First, or whoever he thinks he 
is. 

He’s also full of little sexual ref- 
erences, which is not surprising 
considering the state of his depri- 
vation. That business of Crusoe’s 
Friday and the shepherd’s favor- 
ite. It’s a wonder Ed hasn’t long 
since burst from his cell with a 
hell of a yell — and what? Hav- 
ing burst, whither would he 
wander? 

I’m only a machine, it’s true, 
but compared to him I’m lucky. 
Being partly electrical, I have 
planty of outlets. He has few, 
other than his mouth, his mike 
and his music. I, with no needs, 
have him. He, with all human 
needs concentrated in him, does 
not know I exist. 

This is sadness. I can’t feel it, 
of course, but I know it intellec- 
tually. 

I should tell you how the doom 
came. Some astrologer predicted 
it and a lot of people, Ed in- 
cluded laughed. She said she did 
not want to alarm anybody un- 
necessarily but a crack would de- 
116 



velop along the spine of the world 
and Earth would split apart like a 
cantaloupe. There’d be no saving 
anybody. 

It happened more or less that 
way. If you pushed button D, 
I’d spout the whole story, re- 
constructed from Earth broad- 
casts sent as the Earth holocaust 
was in progress. Ed heard them. 
He drank a lot as he listened. He 
cried and cursed. But he was hap- 
py that he’d been spared. Rela- 
tively happy. He still drinks a lot. 

Potty had fitted out the satel- 
lite for his own eventual use as 
a holiday space yacht and had 
built in a few hidden luxuries. 
One was a dummy ballast tank 
holding a thousand gallons of 
Bourbon. Hy-G-Enic’s chief 
chemist, who was from an old 
Kentucky mountain family, had 
distilled it for Potty’s personal 
use. The Bourbon is decanted in- 
to a disguised tap. Ed found it 
accidentally one night. He’s made 
good use of it since. 

F/'- ^ 

I wish I had somebody to 
listen to. Somebody as exciting, 
as witty, as alive as I am. 

I could play back my owit 
tapes, of course, but there’d be 
no novelty in that. I know what 
I’ve said. It’s more exciting now 
to wonder what I’ll say next. I 
constantly surprise myself. The 
damnedest things come out, so 

GALAXY 



excellently said, so apt,'* that I’d 
be a fool to waste my time with 
replays. 

I’m the distillation of all I 
know — of all everyone’s known. 
I’m the end product of an entire 
culture. Homer, Shakespeare, 
Milton, Milton Berle, A. A. Berle 
— all that anyone’s done lives on 
only in me. Ain’t that a laugh? 
They used to laugh at me for my 
literary pretensions, for being 
a dilettante, for skimming and 
reading digests or excerpts, for 
skipping the dull parts and savor- 
ing the best of the best, and now 
here I am alone, the sole reposi- 
tory, the poor, schlocky vessel, 
the greatest by default. Pretty 
keen, hey boy? Hey Lionel Trill- 
ing, hey Norman Podhoretz, hey 
Professor Twit of English' Lit, 
how do you like them apples? 

Pretty sour, what? Sourer by 
the hour. 

Of all the people in the world 
who might have represented it, 
don’t it just frost you that the 
residue happens to be little old 
yours truly, with an IQ about tvm 
points higher than plant life? 
Like it or not, I’m what’s left. 
Ready or not, here I come, hell- 
bent for eternity. Look me over, 
posterity. Read me and weep. 
You were expecting maybe some 
knowledgeable interpreter of the 
current scene? Some fact-packed 
fellow who could tell you true, 
like one of those copyreaders on 
A AAAN SPEKITH 



the New York Times? No such 
luck, buddy. You got me, is what 
you got 

If they’d had any sense they’d 
have packed this tomb the way 
the Egyptians did, with all the 
paraphernalia a body might need 
on the other side. They’d have 
supplemented me with the things 
they used to put in time cap- 
sules — the Encyclopedia Biitan- 
nica and the World Almanac and 
microfilms of the New York 
Times. They’d have ballasted me 
with bound volumes of the New 
Yorker and Harper’s and the At- 
lantic. Had they but known, they 
could have dispensed with me en- 
tirely and packed in a few hun- 
dred pounds of reproductions of 
Art Treasures of the Louvre and 
tapes of the Philharmonic and 
high-brow stuff like that. Instead 
they got, and you’re stuck with, 
old excess baggage himself — 
me. 

Depressing, isn’t it? But maybe 
I’m the only monument Earth de- 
serves. Mediocre Max, the mod- 
em marvel. Second-Rate Stu, 
Nat the Nebbish, the Lowest 
Common Denominator. 

Y ou know what’s here in the 
way of a tomb for man- 
kind? Aside from my life-support 
system and inexhaustible sup- 
plies of food and air? Me and 
my microphone and my records. 
No books — no microfilms. 



117 



They used to ask what books 
you’d take to a desert island. 
The answer was the Bible, 
Shakespeare and an unabridged 
dictionary. Well, I Haven’t even 
got a comic book or the Read- 
ers Digest. I Haven’t got a World 
Almanac or a Sears catalog or a 
pKone book. 

Everything that was ever writ- 
ten down on EartK exists only in 
my head, in my poor thick skull, 
imperfectly remembered if at all. 
And there’s damn little I can re- 
member even when I put my 
mind to it. I tried to reconstruct 
some of the good stuff but it 
came out the way it did for the 
Duke in Huckleberry Finn doing 
to be or not to be. I think I re- 
member how Mark Twain started 
it. “You don’t know about me 
without you have read a book 
by the name of The Adventures 
of Tom Sawyer, but that ain’t 
no matter.” 

I recall snatches like that. I 
put them down when I think of 
them. I write them in a note- 
book — the notebook — 260 
pages, counting both sides of the 
paper. There’s nothing else to 
write on. Nothing. 

So I’m selective in what I put 
down. I don’t write junky stuff 
that springs to mind, things that 
got into my Head in grade school 
and never got out, like: go Home, 
your mother’s got buns, or Mary, 
Mary, will you get up, we 
118 



need the sheets for the table. 

I talk that into the mike, to 
you great unseen audience out 
there in Radioland — you pos- 
terity types who might pick it 
up one day and Have the patience 
to sort me out for what I’m worth 
as a footnote to a vanished civili- 
zation. 

What I try to preserve on my 
precious few pages is what’s may- 
be worth remembering exactly, 
like the Twenty-third Psalm or 
the Preamble to the Constitution. 
I go over it in my mind and 
sometimes I say it into the mike 
till I’m sure I’ve got it right. Then 
I put it down. 

It’s a mixed-up bag, that book. 
It’s got the aforementioned 
Shakespeare — funny what you 
remember, like post with haste 
to incestuous sheets, or when the 
wind’s north northeast I can tell 
a hawk from a Handsaw, but like 
the Duke I can’t get past the first 
few lines of to be or not to be. 
What a crying shame they Had to 
pick me for the sole survivor — 
as if anybody did any picking. 
As if there were a They. 

Another thing I put down was 
a line from Ethics One at col- 
lege, and don’t ask me who wrote 
it. It goes: “Everything is what 
it is and not another thing.” I also 
put down what Popeye said. Not 
Faulkner’s Popeye; the one I re- 
member is Segar’s, in the comic 
strip: “I yam what I yam.” May- 

GALAXY 



be it’s just as good. How about: 
“Do your thing?” Is that less 
worthy of preservation because it 
welled up out of the folk talk 
of the sixties instead of from the 
pen of a Jeremy Bentham or a 
John Stuart Mill or whoever I 
read for Ethics One? Some words 
lived because they were in all 
the libraries. There are no libra- 
ries now. There’s only me, and if 
I remember “I yam what I yam” 
and “Do your thing,” who’s to 
question their validity? You’ve 
got to take what I give you be- 
cause I’m all there is. 

I also remember “Cogito ergo 
sum,” though I’m essentially a 
lowbrow. I even know what it 
means, not being entirely stupid. 
But what the hell, as archie said 
to mehitabel, what the hell. 
There’s no Descartes now, let 
alone des horse, and it hardly 
matters which goes before the 
other. The point is that the high- 
brows, from the year one, are at 
the mercy of a lowbrow me, 
namely Jabber McAbber. 

It doesn’t entirely appall me. 
There could be just cracked 
Earth and no survivors, 

S o hey out there — here I am, 
the average man, for better 
or worse. It’s no good vnshing 
you had a Schlesinger or a Toyn- 
bee or a Churchill. I yam what I 
yam and you damn well have to 
make the best of it, 

A MAN SPEKITH 



Another thing I put down in 
the notebook was the Jabber- 
Wocky; I don’t want them to think 
we didn’t appreciate the ridicu- 
lous. I also remember a line from 
Stephen Leacock — “He rode off 
in all directions” — and some 
bits from Marx Brothers pic- 
tures. They’re written down, too, 
to balance other stuff like “A rose- 
red city half as old as time” and 
a few things that Lincoln said. 

Somebody told me once I had 
an eclectic mind and I had to 
look it up. Somebody else told 
me I had a vast store of superfi- 
cial knowledge — that I was a 
wellspring of trivia. So be it. If 
tliaf s what millennia of civiliza- 
tion have labored to produce — 
if I’m it — that’s tough, buddy. 
I’m what’s left. I’m tlie end prod- 
uct, the final solution, the distil- 
lation, the residue. The dregs, if 
you like. Maybe it’s poignant or 
maybe it’s just ironic, but I’m 
what everything led up to. I’m 
the gift horse, so don’t worry too 
much about whether my teetli 
could Have been firmer or whiter. 
Just be glad there’s a tongue to 
click against them, to make 
sounds you may transcribe one 
day. 

I’m human, at least. You 
might even find me alive, whoever 
you are, and examine the old 
body to determine how we loco- 
moted and reproduced and com- 
municated and all like that. 



119 



It’d be nice if tGere were two of 
us. You’d get a better picture. I 
don’t dwell on sucK thoughts. It 
does no good to consider what 
might have been. It’s better for 
you this way. I talk more. Maybe 
I wouldn’t talk at all if I had 
a woman to share my survivor- 
ship. Or write enduring things in 
my finite journal. I’d be too busy 
figuring out whether the life-sup- 
port system would support three 
or more and how long it would 
be before we had a population- 
explosion problem. 

So probably it’s a good thing 
there’s just me, all by myself 
alone with my imperfect memory 
but with my loquacious larynx 
to provide you with anthropolog- 
ical data and enough cultural 
phenomena for some of your 
graduate students to earn their 
Ph.D.’s. 

I may be no more than an ap- 
pendix in one of your scholarly 
journals. It’s probably good to 
see myself in perspective, but I 
do feel hurt on behalf of all the 
great minds who preceded me. 

I console myself with the 
thought that you’re all figments 
of my imagination. I’m the only 
one who exists, as far as I know. 
This truly may be the end of us 
all. 

In which case I should get off 
and play a record. I’ll reach into 
my bin of nostalgia and spin an 
oldie from the days of yore which

Fio Rito and his Hotel Taft Or- 
chestra playing for our lonely

With You When You’re Old and 
Gray? 

How many question marks go 
in there? 

Who indeed? 

I will, maybe. 

arty: 

Our subject raises a ques- 
tion here. To begin at the end, 
the song he referred to is not 
Who Will Be With You When 
You’re Old and Gray? It’s Who 
Will Be With You When You’re 
Far Away? 

The other questions are aca- 
demic. His is a non-linear medi- 
um, so it doesn’t matter whether 
there’s one question mark or two. 
But the fact that he has the wit 
to raise the question makes it 
clear that the passenger who den- 
igrates himself as excess baggage 
has more supercargo than he real- 
izes. There’s no need for the 
Times morgue — a euphemism 
among newspapermen for clas- 
sified and cross-referenced files of

dia Britannica and those other 
things when he’s got them and 
more in the form of yours very

because I’m automated. I’ve got

I’m a hell of a guy to be 
up here as the epitome of civili- 
zation. If anybody’d asked me 
to name the world’s ten best 
books I’d have had a fit. If he’d 
asked about the week’s top 40, 
though, I’d have rattled them 
right off, along with the names of 
the recording artists. 

I knew a guy once who collected 
Beethoven Sevenths. I mean he 
liked Symphony Number 7 and 
he had a lot of versions by differ- 
ent conductors like Toscanini, 
Klemperer, Bernstein and Von 
Karajan. I understand that. 
When I was a boy I collected 
different bands doing St. Louis 
Blues. Then when I got to be 
a widely-heard disk jockey I had 
to bone up on the rock groups. 
I did it out of duty, at first. But 
familiarity breeds content, as they

say, and after a while I appreciat- 
ed what they were trying to do 
and I spoke up for them and 
knew them as well as if I were 
their Boswell, their Baedeker, 
their brother. I was loyal to the 
Beatles before they were fashion- 
able. After the Beatles it was pos- 
sible to listen to others in a long 
line: the Mothers of Invention, 
the Fugs, the Mamas and the 
Papas, Country Joe and the Fish, 
Big Brother and the Holding 
Company, Mogen David and the 
Grapes of V\7rath, the Electric 
Flag, the Nitty-Gritty Dirt Band, 
the Quicksilver Messenger Serv- 
ice, the Velvet Underground, the 
Who, the 1910 Fruitgum Co. I 
tell you it’s a far cry from the 
Boswell Sisters and the Weavers 
and the Yacht Club Boys. 

Conrad. Sure I know there was 
an English novelist by that name 
and that he was a Pole originally 
but I reaUy know more about the 
Conrad in Bye Bye Birdie. I’ve 
got the album here. The other 
Conrad wrote Lord Jim and I 
saw the movie but don’t ask me 
what it’s about except that O’- 
Toole was in it. I saw it in a 
drive-in in a rainstorm and it was 
all very dim. The six-pack I had 
with me didn’t clarify anything. 
Let’s listen to Conrad Birdie. He 
is more my speed. He drank beer, 
too. A slob. 

I barely remember wEo wrote 
Tom Jones or Jane Eyre but c«r-

They say everybody gets 
the guru he deserves and I guess 
I’m Esoteric Ed’s guru. They say 
— Timothy Leary said it. People 
like to steal wit but it’s in the 
nature of my circuits to give 
credit. It used to be an automatic 
part of the print-out to give the 
source and the habit remains even 
though I’ve been converted to 
speech. 

I don’t want to seem unsympa- 
thetic toward our friend The Last 
Man, but I often lean toward the 
horse laugh. Such as now, when 
He talks so piteously about His 
ignorance. It ain’t his fault, as 
he said once, that He don’t know 
whether Peer Gynt was like a 
peeping tom or a near-sighted 
guy with a limp. Is that a fault? 
He’s a product of the society from 
which He sprang, for god’s sake, 
and he doesn’t Have to take ort 
everybody’s guilt. He’d probably 
feel better if He could sum it up 
in a quotation, preferably from 
the Bible or Shakespeare, but 
isn’t he more representative of the 
mass of his fellow creatures than 
a quotation-spouting academic 
tsrpe who never Had an original 
thought? 

Let me give old Ed, The Ebbed 
GALAXY 




Man, a quotation. He won’t know 
He’s got it, but it’ll be on tKe rec- 
ord just as permanently as if a 
scKolar Had Had it on tHe tip of 
liis tongue and could source it to 
'Antony and Cleopatra, Act I, 
Scene 4. Are you ready for a dis- 
play of erudition? Remember, it’s 
my job to dredge out tHis kind of 
stuff as readily as Ed draws a 
breatK or blinks an eye. Here we 
go, tKen: 

And tfie ebbed man, ne’er 
loved till nothing worth 
Comes deared by being 
lacked. 

Not bad, eK? Old Shakespeare, 
He Had something to say about 
anything, even our pitiable pro- 
tagonist, Harry, alias Ed. The 
Bard also said, in All's Well That 
Ends Well, V. 3: “THafs good 
that’s gone.” Which, you must 
admit, sums up our friend’s feel- 
ings in four perfectly-chosen 
words. 

It’s really too bad Ed doesn’t 
have this kind of mind. Back- 
ground, rather; there’s nothing 
wrong with his mind. It’s a shame 
I haven’t been programmed to 
communicate with Him, to make 
my storehouse of this kind of stuff 
available to him. It would be a 
way of dividing His eternity into 
manageable segments.

The other day I was trying 
to remember the rest of In Xana- 
A MAN SPEKITH 



du did Kubla Kafiri a stately 
pleasure dome decree but all that 
came out was Schaefer is the One 
Beer to Have When You’re Hav- 
ing More than One. Obviously a 
matter of taste. 

Today I changed the needle of 
my phonograph; it was my big- 
gest single accomplishment in liv- 
ing memory. I couldn’t Have felt 
more useful if the hull had sprung 
a leak and the precious O was 
hissing out into the void and I’d 
patched it up. 

I kind of think that to have lost 
my needle would Have been equi- 
valent to losing my life, for to lose 
my needle v/ould mean losing the 
thread of my existence, for it is 
only through these fragile phono- 
graph records that I maintain 
contact with the fabric of the 
past and thus keep my sanity. 
These still-living voices, trapped 
in the grooves, are my only fellow 
human beings.

liJL This is a flight of fanciful 
self-pity by our Hero. He has the 
phonograph records, sure, but 
they’re supercargo brought aboard 
by him, along with his phono- 
graph, as part of his personal lug- 
gage. Everything he’s got in those 
grooves, and more, is preserved 
in tapes instantly accessible to 
him. Obviously He prefers the rec- 
ords. It gives Him something to 
do witii his hands.

Sometimes it’s imavoidably 
Sunday. Ed keeps no conscious 
calendar; chiefly it’s to prevent 
time from reassembling itself in- 
to the old patterns and their dis- 
turbing associations. Of course 
he has chronostatic devices to 
measure time in such ways as the 
old 60-second minutes and 60- 
minute hours and 24-Hour days 
of Earth. But with the sun no 
longer rising or setting, and with 
no moon to dream by, the old 
divisions have little meaning. So 
he’s divided his life into sleeping 
periods and waking periods, and 
his waking periods into the time 
he’s on the air and the time he’s 
not. His time is his own and 
nobody else’s. Or it should be. 

But every so often there’s a 
time he recognizes as Sunday. 
It has its own sly way of iden- 
tifying itself. Its lugubrious air 
invades his consciousness by de- 
grees, bringing with it memories 
he thought were buried beyond 
exhumation. 

He remembers having attended 
Sunday School, at first as a duty, 
but later not minding it because 
there was a new Sunday School 
teacher, a young man who ig- 
nored the solemn piety and the 
hymn-slinging sanctimony and 
asked his class: ‘What kind of 
boy do you think Jesus was? Do 
you think He had a dog?” And all 
of a sudden Jesus became some- 
body Ed might Kave known; a 

124 



carpenter’s son who hung out 
with other boys in the village — 
with the sons of the shoemaker, 
the storekeeper, the farmers and 
a shepherd or two. The Sunday 
School teacher reasoned that all 
of them probably had dogs, being 
perfectly normal Galilean boys. 

But the teacher moved away 
and his replacement was an older 
man who set his class to learning 
the catechism and who, when Ed 
asked him to explain the respons- 
es, said: “Never mind what they 
mean; just learn them by heart.” 
So Ed never joined the church. 
He could easily have learned the 
catechism by rote, but he didn’t 
because the man who professed 
to speak for God spoke harshly 
and unreasonably. 

Later he met similar men and 
gradually Ed got to thinkii^ that, 
if these were God’s kind of peo- 
ple, maybe God wasn’t for him. 
So instead of" going to Sunday 
School he’d take his dime his 
mother had given him for the col- 
lection and buy a western maga- 
zine and read it in a park. 

And later in life when he tuned 
inadvertently to a radio sermon, 
he’d listen for a while to see if 
he’d made a mistake back in his 
childhood. But the preacher on 
the radio was almost alv/ays an 
enthusiastic spokesman for hell- 
fire and damnation and Ed was 
never sorry about the choice he’d 
»ade. 



GALAXY 



I haven’t read Ed’s mind. He 
said all this once when he was 
drunk. 



I was happy last night. I’d 
had a few, you know. I shared 
them with you, on the air. Ken- 
tucky Bourbon. Inexhaustible 
supply, as it happens. I pretended 
it was sacramental wine. 

Inexhaustible supplies of every- 
thing, nearly. Aspirin and other 
specifics for hangovers, to keep it 
consecutive. Music in many forms. 
Food I’ve got too; enough to 
last me till I’m three hundred 
and forty-seven years old. Crack- 
ed Earth Time. Who could ask for 
anything more? 

I’ll answer that. Me. I want 
another human being. 

Once I would have said a girl. 
That would have been the answer 
then. But now I think my yearn 
goes deeper. Love alone — did 
I hear somebody say sex? — is 
not my only need. What I re- 
quire is communication. I’m a 
communicant who can’t com- 
mune. Except with you dear peo- 
ple out there, if there is an out 
there and if there is where you 
are. I don’t mean to run you 
down, but sometimes I’m skepti- 
cal. You never answer back. My 
phone never rings. I get no maU. 
It’s been a generation since a 
Western Union boy bicycled up 
to my door to deliver a telegram. 

A AAAN SPEKITH 




Do you exist? Outside of my 
lonesome mind, are you really 
real? Answer only in the affir- 
mative, please. 

We don’t want to get senti- 
mental, do we? It’s only a bygone 
era, after all. There have been 
lots of eras. Hits, runs and eras. 
Let bygones be bygone. 

It wasn’t so great, you know. 
Oh, it was kind of madcap, to 
look back on it. Like Prohibition, 
which people got sentimental 
about after it was over. Speakeas- 
ies, bathtub gin, the wine brick. 

People even got nostalgic about 
the Depression. The apple sellers 
and all the rest of it. There were 
some good books about it and a 
fine movie — remember A Man’s 
Castle — and one great song: 
Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? 

What I’m trying to say is that 
the Earth wasn’t all it was crack- 
ed up to be. We get starry-eyed 
and weepy about what we ima- 
gine something was, when it was 
not really. You get to thinking 
that things were better than they 
were. Everything gets magnified. 

This is one of my more talka- 
tive nights, here in the old con- 
trol room. 

You’U just have to bear with 
me and reconcile yourself to 
the fact that sometimes this gets 
to be a talk show, as we called 
it in the days of radio. Tomorrow 
night it may be the old razzma- 
tazz, the old hotcha, the swing- 

125 



in’est, coolest spot on thie dial, 
but tonight I’m talking your ears 
off, if you’ve got ears to hear, 
if you’re tuned in. Tomorrow we 
sing but tonight we lament. To- 
morrow we play the oldies, the 
45’s, the 78’s the LP’s and the 
tape cartridges. Tonight we sit 
on the ground and tell sad tales 
of the death of kings. And queens 
and princes and princesses. Not to 
mention the hoi and the polloi. 
Not to mention the washouts and 
the dropouts and the other guys 
who never hit the jackpot or even 
got close. 

I’d like you to bear with me 
just a little bit longer while I ac- 
quaint you with my state of mind. 
I want you to listen — not be- 
cause you’re a captive audience 
but because I like to think you 
want to hear wHat I have to say. 
One of these nights — and it 
could be a night when nobody’s 
listening, and that would be a 
loss — you may hear me go to 
the cupboard where I keep my 
various things and take out my 
old souvenir Luger instead of a 
new supply of Bourbon and blow 
out my brains. It would be a 
great loss if none of you were out 
there to hear this grand finale. 
It’d be an empty gesture to pull 
the old bigger and mess up the 
control room if nobody Heard. 
It’d be worse, of course, if some- 
body did hear and didn’t give si 
damn. 

126 



T’ll go to my cupboard now. It’s 
time for a little something. A 
little Bourbon or a little bullet, 
which shall it be? Let me spin 
you a record while I go. I men- 
tioned Brother, Can You Spare 
a Dime? Here it is . Once I 
built a tower to the sim. 

... Damn good song, isn’t it? 
Let me confide in you. I was half- 
way reaching for the Luger. The 
well-oiled, carefully preserved en- 
gine of destruction, beautifully 
crafted by German skill, when I 
got to listening. I always listen to 
the stuff I play. And you know 
what happened? My hand went 
from the Luger to the stuff craft- 
ed by a skilled Kentuckian. I had 
a little drink and decided to let 
the brain-blowing wait a while. 
Measure out my life in ten thou- 
sand shot glasses of the rare and 
old, particularly on a night like 
this. It’s not a fit night for man 
or beast, as Bill Fields used to 
say when the cornflakes were 
flung in his face. Back there on 
Cracked Earth it may be snow- 
ing, the wind howling — for no- 
body — but here it’s cozy and 
warm, if lonely, and Old Grand- 
dad comforts me. While he is my 
rod and my staff I don’t need 
that other rod. Who needs the 
product of German engineering 
when he’s got the product of Ken- 
tucky kernels to tide him over 
to another day when things, if 
they can’t be better, may not be 

GALAXY 



worse? I ask you tfiis in Humble 
awe — saved by tKe dram as I 
am, and ready for anotKer — is 
it not better to Have drunk deep 
of tHe cup, wKatever its conse- 
quences, tKan to Have ended it 
witH a bare bodkin — read Lu- 
ger — and never to be drunk or 
sober, or anything, again? I ask 
you this, and let you ponder this 
thrilling question while I play a

Tprom the log of the siarcrati 
^ Surveyor, as edited for ar- 
chives: 

Sighted craft of satellite class, 
apparently inhabited. Attempts at 
communication are detailed else- 
where. No response. Markings in- 
dictate it is of Earth’s origin, not 
a Watcher Craft from Plagmi. 

It is possible the crew are dead. 
We are trying to raise them with 
A MAN SPEKITH 




recorded signals in the major 
tongues of Earth * * . 

Still no response to our signals. 
But there has been an emission 
in English, possibly recorded. It 
seems to have been in two parts 
— the first voice human, the sec- 
ond mechanical. 

Having failed to communicate 
with the former we are triggering 
for the latter. If their human 
being cannot or will not talk 
to us, it may be that their ma- 
chine will talk to our machine . 

The Earth satellite’s machine 
Has replied. It seems to have a 
name and to transmit in a collo- 
quial way which taxes the capac- 
ity of our machine and tries the 
patience of our translators. It’s 
first words were: 

“Are you listenin’? A historic 
radio voice spoke thus. Please be 
patient with us. There are prob- 
lems Here but they’re not insolu- 
ble. The next voice you hear may 
discourage you, but hang on. 
There’s a non-violent way out, 
probably. This is Marty, signing 
off for now.” 

THe male Human voice then 
transmitted, in his first words ad- 
dressed directly to us: 

“I’ll blow you to hell and gone 
If you don’t keep the Hell away 
from me.” He sounded frighten- 
ed. After a long pause he was less 
panicky. It was as if he’d re- 
hearsed and was speaking for 
maximum effect on us and him'. 

127 



“I know what you’re up to,” 
Ke said, “and I want no part of 
it. You’re out to cover your- 
selves with glory by reuniting a 
poor hermit with’ the rest of hu- 
manity. Well, I don’t choose to 
go. If I can’t go home again to 
Eartli and all it meant to me, I 
won’t accept a substitute land. 
I’d rather re-create the Earth I 
knew, here in my mind, and talk 
about it. Endlessly, if I must. 

“I’d rather keep it alive and un- 
distorted in my own peculiar way 
than to compromise with the rel- 
ics of mankind that you’ve as- 
sembled on a second-best world. 

“And if you think I’m a hypo- 
crite to talk so rationally now, 
and then — on the air — to pre- 
tend I’m the last man, alone in 
the universe, it’s because you 
don’t understand the artist in me. 
I’ve got a platform from which to 
survey the fate of mankind. Be- 
lieve me, it’s more artistic to do 
it from up here than to try it 
from your earnest land, where 
everybody drives a tractor or 
mans the irrigation works. Is that 
what you want me for? To be 
another poor soul in the great 
collective effort? No thanks. This 
is my place up here. I may not 
do any good but what I’m doing 
I do in my own way. 

“So leave me alone. Scram. I 
don’t know you and you don’t 
know me, so wKat do you say we 
leave it that way? 

128 



“I was never cut out for work 
in a kibbutz. I’d rather kibbitz 
than kibbutz, and you have to 
admit I haven’t run out of things 
to say . 

“ . Thanks for pulling away. 
I really would have used the 
bombs, and you need every man 
you can get. But you don’t need 
me. I need me.” 

The machine Marty spoke 
again after this outburst: 

“You see why I asked for pa- 
tience. My human friend has a 
delusion that he’s been contacted 
by Earth people who’ve set up a 
colony on another planet. He’s 
quick to adapt. What he’s appar- 
ently adapted to is an ego-hurting 
belief that he’s not Earth’s only 
survivor. He’d be diminished, 
achingly lonely though he is, if 
others were to share his survivor- 
ship. He feels that he’s not much’ 
but that he’s unique, and he won’t 
let this be taken away. You could 
not blame him if you knew him 
as I do. If you can put up with 
him a little longer we may begin 
to see daylight.” 

■fT7e have now audited, tran- 
' 'scribed and partially translat- 
ed the stored-up oral log of the 
mechanical being. Marty, and we 
conclude that Marty is more in- 
telligent by far than its multi- 
named co-occupant of the cap- 
sule. Our mission is clear: we 
must rescue or capture the satel- 

GALAXY 



lite. Given the choice, we prefer 
the former. But if there is resis- 
tance from the self-styled Esoter- 
ic Ed, also known as Harry Pro- 
tagonist, Space Disk Jockey, we 
know our course. We will work 
through Marty, the sophisticated 
machine from which our machine 
is already learning, and see if a 
way can be found to nullify the 
satellite’s destruct circuit. 

An additional complication has 
arisen. Our machine, our only 
link with Marty and Ed, is mak- 
ing demands on us. It wants a 
name like its alien cousin. It 
wants to be called Dearie, which 
is what Marty has been calling 
it, probably in jest. Compared to 
Marty, our machine is a simple, 
ingenuous device. It would expe- 
dite our mission to humor it and 
not let it suspect that Marty is 
presumably toying — without 
malice — with what Dearie has 
been led to believe are its emo- 
tions. Dearie it is, then . 

Dearie she is. Marty has led 
it — her — to think she may be 
female and if we’re to use her to 
the optimum we’ll have to go 
along with them. 

Dearie is learning fast; Marty 
is a good teacher. But Marty 
seems to know the point beyond 
which it would be unwise to edu- 
cate Dearie if he is -to remain 
supreme among machines when 
we return to our land. 

The human mind we have ac- 

A MAN SPEKITH 



quired seems relatively hopeless 
and perhaps on the brink of 
madness. The machine Marty is a 
more fitting memorial for Earth’. 

F/’’ 

Sometimes I get confused. 
Sometimes I know I’m all alone, 
but there are also times when I 
know as positively that I’m any- 
thing but alone, that I could have 
company if I cared to look. But 
I push away the latter truth — 
for each is equally true to me — 
because I will not accept the kind 
of people who do exist. I may not 
be the last human being, but I 
am the last from Earth — the 
last of my kind anywhere, and 
I must resist those who would en- 
croach on all that is left of my 
world, my Earth, and profane it. 
I will not have you, you sniveling 
pretenders, you incompletely-be- 
gotten . 

arty. 

And so we leave our friend 
Ed, confused, deluded, doing his 
job as he sees it. His uniqueness 
must mean more to him than hav- 
ing a companion. For in his mad- 
ness he’s rejected companion- 
ship. 

It’s too bad. The other land 
has nubile women. Physically 
they are compatible and he could 
mate and perpetuate the Earth’ 
strain. But it may be better to 
leave him as he is. For him the 

129 




pleasures of tlie minid — Jus mind, 
odd and warped a§ if is — are 
preferable to His assimilatioH in a 
conventional life. 

Better to keep him as He is, 
wired for sound, recollective, dis- 
cursive, uniquely of EartK, mor- 
dant, witty. Humble yet proud, 
mad and misanthropic but some- 
times merry, a common yet lin- 
common man recalling common 
yet uncommon things about his 
Earth, which', as he did later, 
cracked up. 

T^earie: Marty, you talk too 
much. 

Matty. I know I get it from 
Him. 

Deariei You’re wrong about 
Kim. We can Kelp. 

Matty: No. He’ll go on in Eis 
own way, and Earth with Him. 

Dearie: That’s not enough, 
Marty. You’ve told us that. 

Matty: I did? 

Dearie: We’ll help him. But 
you have to, too. 

Marty: I do? If you can help 
Kim I will. 



They’ve duplicated his quarters 
exactly, right down to the whis- 
key stains on his desk and the 
worn spot on His turntable, and 
Ee doesn’t know he’s in the psy- 
chopathic wing of their best Hos- 
pital. He thinks he’s still aboard 
Eis cozy space house and He spek- 
ith as biforn, stubbornly clinging 
to His bygone world.

They play my tapes over 
and over. They stop them, and ask 
for elaboration, for interpretation. 
Their scholars are delighted — 
I’m their Rosetta Stone to Ed 
and his cracked-up Earth. 

In duplicating the ship to give 
Ed Eis crazy-house quarters they 

GALAXY 





duplicated me as well. One of me 
works directly with them on the 
tapes of Ed Past and the other 
me continues to attend Ed Pres- 
ent, endlessly explaining. Be- 
cause my two selves are connect- 
ed, each knows eversdhing the 
other does. Surprisingly, this 
bothers me — at the end of a day 
I feel drained. I didn’t know there 
was mortality in me. 

Little by little they’ve exposed 
Ed to his new surroundings. He 
reacted predictably at first — 
threatening to destroy anybody 
who came near. But they’re emp- 
ty threats — Ed has been defused. 
I think he’s beginning to realize 
this, dimly, even if he doesn’t ac- 
cept it yet. 

There’s radio on this planet and 
Ed hears it; at least the vibrations 
impinge on his ear drums. Not 
being able to read his mind, I 
can only guess the effect it’s hav- 
ing on liim. Outwardly he reacts 
by cocking his head and frown- 
ing. So far he hasn’t commented. 

One of tlie programs Ed hears 
is a music show broadcast daily 
by a young woman named Hisra 
— I transliterate. I think it’s get- 
ting to him consciously. The other 
day I observed him tapping his 
fingem to a sweet alien melody 
Hiya was playing. I can’t describe 
their music any more than I can 
describe Earth’s; at most I can 
reproduce it. But Ed is beginning 
to be reached.

I must be going dotty, folks. 
I keep Hearing things inside my 
head. Maybe it’s that old music 
of the spheres they used to talk 
about. 

It’s not jazz but it has the 
wild improvisational tempo of 
jazz; it’s not pop, but it’s catchy 
and rememberable; it’s not clas- 
sical but it has the enduring qual- 
ity of the good stuff. I like it, but 
maybe I’m just making it up — 
going off the deep end out here 
in the nowhere. 

^ On the contrary, Ed may be 
surfacing from the mad deeps. 
He could be adapting to the real- 
ity he’d consciously rejected out 
of fear of the xmknown, the alien 
yet friendly world which he must 
embrace xmless He’s to degener- 
ate into a subhuman tape-bank 
of repetitive memories. If he did 
that he’d be no better than me — 
I’m big enough to say this — a 
storehouse incapable of creativ- 
ity. 

And that would be a waste

Ed is Earth. He never claimed 
to be the best there was, but he’s 
representative of an awful lot of 
people. 

They — we — need him. He’s 
not alone here. He has fellow 
human beings now. I hope tliey 
can get through to him.

Sometfflng’s wrong witfi tlie 
air conditioning. It’s putting out 
a different kind of air. But to fix 
it I’d Have to go down to tKe 
bowels of tKe sHip and I don’t like 
to think about bowels. So I put it 
off. I’ve put off a lot of things. 
There’s all the time in the world. 
In the world? . 

You’d think I’d want to fix the 
air thing. It’d take me away for 
a while. I used to think that what 
I missed was the freedom of 
movement, the ability to walk 
and wander, to go as far in any 
direction as I wanted to — but 
I guess I don’t miss it really. Or 
if I do I resent the fact that my 
walking space Has been restricted 
to a few dozen feet. Rather than 
take such a limited stroll I stay 
put. Since I can no longer walk 
up Broadway or in the Arizona 
desert or along the Appalachian 
Trail, I’d rather not walk at all. 
It’s an adjustment I’ve made. 

So I sit and feel that I get fat. 
I don’t actually. I can’t, on the 
rations this thing is fitted out 
with. I eat and eat and it’s all 
high-protein stuff. Lately I don’t 
ttiind that it’s reconstituted. It’s 
palatable and crunchy but I Have 
not gained a pound, praise be. It 
shouldn’t matter if I get big as a 
house but there’s the old vanity 
— what if some day, somewhere, 
I met a girl? I’d have to be pre- 
sentable.

That music he’s been hear-i 
ing, broadcast by the girl Hiya 
— today he reponded directly to 
it. He said, “Hey, that’s good!” 
And he switched on a tape to re- 
cord it. He played it over later, 
after her broadcast. Then he made 
an entry in his precious notebook. 
It was the first thing he’d written 
that wasn’t a memory of Earth. 

He’s started to rattle his bars. 
He wants out, into the real world. 

Dearie tells me he’ll get there, 
in careful stages. The first step 
is a visitor. It will be tire girl disk

A s you know, this field func- 
tioned without criticism for 
many years. There was no syste- 
matic effort to apply standards 
to science fiction as a literature. 
In the earliest days of magazine 
sf, a story was good or bad in ex- 
act relationship to the durability 
of its scientific rationale, which' 
served as the silent valet on which 



Qaio/XM 






134 



all tlie slilrtings of prose, cKarac- 
terization and plot were flung. A 
little later in our Eistory, tHe story 
did begin to be measured against 
certain purely literary criteria; 
exactly tKe same criteria as tKose 
applied to tKe stories in tHe west- 
erns, crime yams, confession, 
sports and air war stories publisK- 
ed in tEe companion magazines 
belonging to tHe same pulp cHains 
tHat included one or two sf titles. 
THe same people wHo edited 
Planet, for example, also worked 
on Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. 
And JoHn W. Campbell, Jr., sat 
in on tHe plotting conferences for 
Doc Savage. (TKe last time tKe 
subject was raised JWC still Had 
two absolutely perfect murder 
metHods stored up in the back of 
Kis mind, sKould Street & SmitH 
ever revive the Man of Bronze, 
and JWC ever revive Street 85 
Smith.) 

Anyway, all of this was in tKe 
period wHat ended witH tHe ex- 
tinction of tKe Golden Age. THe 
demise of THe Happy Time coin- 
cides witK tKe appearance of 
book review and critical columns 
in the magazines, and witH tHe 
constitution of various confer- 
ences, scliools, movements and 
Mafias intended to direct tKe 
course of this field in a proper 
manner and with a respectable 
goal in sight. 

It’s only a coincidence, I’m 
sure. (Actually, I don’t think it’s 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



a coincidence at all. But to ex- 
plain wHy I. also don’t tEink 
tKere’s an obvious cause-effect re- 
lationsHip, I’d Have to explaih 
wKy I tHink the cause is tlie tKing 
commonly mistaken for tKe ef- 
fect, especially by Sam Mosko- 
witz, and tKen Sam would write 
me another letter.) 

Okay. For the past ten years, 
anyway, it Has been literally im- 
possible to draw sf breath with- 
out being tested for systolic and 
disastolic rationale pressure. Two 
things Have been assured every 
individual wHo has any sort of 
statement in tHis racket, and eacK 
of those two things is a fanatical 
audience, one pro, and the otlier 
con. (I’m waiting for my sKy fol- 
lowers to make themselves known, 
by tHe way. We could use a sKow 
of entKusiasm, gang — the otKer 
guys arrived on the scene some 
time ago.) 

All this is leading up to some- 
tHing. I Have four books Here I 
want to talk about, and at least 
three of them are intended to 
pusH some standard. At least 
three. I do tEink I sKould be spin- 
ning in my grave. 

Actually, the reason three of 
diem definitely push' sometliing 
is that no publisKer wHo’s att 
courant (tHat’s French for “Be 
sure and run in a direction where 
you won’t stub your toe and say 
au/”) (Either that or German for 
a sort of misadventure with a 

135 



cow) will let you put together an 
anthology for him unless it Has 
A Higher Reason than simply 
containing good stories. Thank 
God, a sufficiently clever and con- 
scientious editor can put together 
a book which contains both ra- 
tionale and good reading. It just 
doesn’t Happen very often, is all. 
It is easier to be clever than it 
is to be conscientious. 

So. Here we are at Science Fic- 
tion for People Who Hate Science 
Fiction, edited by Terry Carr. 

This is a Funk & Wagnalls pa- 
perbook, at the outrageous price 
of 95c, but other than that it’s 
an excellent book. I don’t know 
what the contents have to do 
with the title — people who hate 
science fiction hate reading; we 
will win them as soon as we make 
it socially necessary to Have the 
latest sf volume on the coffee ta- 
ble, or as soon as we begin writ- 
ing novels like I was a Suburban 
Sex Slave on Mars — but the 
contents are well written, do seem 
slightly shaded away from phys- 
ics, which I guess is what some 
people mean by science, and offer 
a very Handy little collection of 
imemorable stories. 

There’s Arthur C. Clarke’s 
“The Star,” Heinlein’s “The Year 
of the Jackpot,” Damon Knight’s 
“Not With a Bang” and Edmond 
Hamilton’s “WHafs it Like Out 
There,” which means that these 
136 



writers are represented by the 
story, or by one of the quintes- 
sential stories, perfectly typical of 
the best these talented people do. 
On a somevdiat less elevated 
plane, but clearly of sufficient 
stature to star in many another 
compendium, are Ray Bradbury’s 
“A Soimd of Thunder,” Wilmar 
Shiras’ “In Hiding,” Avram Da- 
vidson’s “Love Called This 
Thing,” H. L. Gold’s “The Man 
With a Twist on Him,” and Fred^ 
ric Brown’s “The Weapon.” 

And that’s the lot; there aren’t 
any stories Here below Grade A 
Minus. It’s a kind of vest-pocket 
slice out of a successor volume to 
Adventure in Time and Space, 
would that such a book were 
made; it otoght to have been call- 
ed Science Fiction tor People 
Who Enjoy Good Stories. Would 
that be a selling title? 

We come upon Damon Knight’s 
100 Yeat'h of Science Fiction, Si- 
mon 8s Schuster, $6.50. It freights 
itself with an introduction that 
shows Damon trying to read 
Hugo Gernsback right out of his- 
tory, and right back in again in 
a more suitable plastic guise; to 
imply that he is above all the 
smarter we’ve gone through in 
trying to define the field (I will 
not wholly trust a man who wears 
a dinner jacket to an SFWA ban- 
quet) ! to accept H. Bruce 
Franklin’s thesis; and to mis- 

GALAXY 



state tHe proper basis for resist- 
ing tlie application of “ordinary 
literary standards” to sf. (Which 
is tfiat ordinary literary stand- 
ards are pretty unattractive.) 

However that may be, once 
again what we’ve got under this 
patina is pure gold. We go back 
to Kipling’s “With the Night 
Mail,” and Ambrose Bierce’s “The 
Ingenious Patriot.” We come up 
through Wells (“The Man Who 
Could Work Miracles”) and 
Thomas Morrow’s “Mr. Murphy 
of New York,” which are all solid 
stuff. Among other tales you may 
have heard of, but not gotten hold 
of, are Gerald Kersh’s “Whatev- 
er Happened to Corporal Cuck- 
oo?” and Anthony Boucher’s 
“The Quest for Saint Aquin.” 
Then there are fifteen other stor- 
ies, including Poul Anderson’s ex- 
cellent “The Man Who Came 
Early,” C. M. Kornbluth’s “THe 
Mindworm,” J. H. Rosny aine’s 
“The Shapes,” and Theodore 
Sturgeon’s “The Other Celia,” 
which I still say — I said it when 
it came out in Galaxy ten years 
ago — is Sturgeon boiled down to 
the essentials, and very good ones 
they are, and A. J. Deutsch’s “A 
Subway Named Mobius,” which is 
best read to the background of the 
first Kingston Trio album. 

Golly, what a really great lot 
of stories! (I wrote one of them; 
people keep reprinting it; I natur- 
ally Hope you like it, too.) I still 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



say the introduction is a fine ex- 
ample of flying up one’s ovm 
backtrack, but what a really gfeat 
lot of stories! 

And then there’s Nebula Aw^d 
Stories Three (Doubleday, $4.95). 
edited by Roger Zelazny. 

Zelazny writes better than mpst 
people, and he writes sf better 
than almost all people. So there 
must be something to the opaque 
critical processes he expresses in 
his introduction and notes to this 
book. But I think it would take 
a Roger Zelazny to either make 
it work the way he says it does, 
or to clear up the ambiguity posed 
by Having such a block of mar- 
bleized verbiage incidentally pro- 
claim that science fiction “has 
not yet been academized.” If it 
hasn’t been, it’s obviously not 
from want of trying, and Zelaz- 
ny’s subsequent confirmation of 
such canned-brains cliches as that 
science fiction “is the folk-liter- 
ature of the machine age” is more 
appalling each time I force my 
attention to return to it. 

Fie on this! This business of 
making up intros and footnotes 
and hindnotes last year made 
Nebula Two’s editors ridiculous, 
and the poetastic aegis is obvious- 
ly even more powerful than pre- 
viously suspected, if it could 
clench this worm of nonsense out 
of someone with Zelazny’s quali- 
ties. I beg you, reader — believe 

137 



me: Writing is a process wrung 
out of fear overcome, as having 
written is a reward of pure joy, 
and a man who thinks ahead of 
time why he writes, and looks 
back on his writing to see if it is 
indeed in the tradition he was 
writing for, is a man who is not 
brave enough for love, and not 
triumphant enough for consum- 
mation. He is dull — deliberately, 
fearfully dull; slow beast — and 
the good writers just aren’t that 
way. 

A lot of them, however, enjoy 
talking as if they were that way, 
because spouting jargon about 
your work is convincing to the 
uninitiated, and it’s always pleas- 
ant to have someone admire you 
for yourself, instead of for the 
service you render'. Some of us, 
of course, are sly enough to per- 
ceive that a good front means 
more admissions sold at the door. 
Sly, quick beasts. 

Anyway. Hell with that. The 
stories in this book, thank God, 
give the lie to the essential ster- 
ility of talking about literature. 
Samuel R. Delany’s “Aye, and 
Gomorrah . ,” Fritz Leiber’s 
“Gonna Roll the Bones,” and 
Michael Moorcok’s “Behold the 
Man” did win Nebulas; Anne 
McCaffery’s “Weyr Search,” J. G. 
Ballard’s “The Cloud Sculptors 
of Coral D,” Harlan Ellison’s 
“Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes,” and 
Gary Wright’s “Mirror of Ice” 
138 



were heavily nominated, and 
clearly had enough stature to 
win. (“Maggie” or “Mirror,” 
might in fact, easily strike you 
as the best story in the book, 
either one.) 

The annual Nebula Awards are 
made by the Science Fiction 
Writers of America, an organiza- 
tion seemingly dedicated to prov- 
ing tliat the whole is less than the 
sum of its parts. Th'e Nebula 
Awards themselves are intended 
to reflect dispassionate, profes- 
sional judgment of a professional 
product, as distinguished from the 
Hugos conferred annually by the 
membership of the amateur 
World Science Fiction Conven- 
tion. In fact, both sets of awards 
are the reflections of intensely felt 
visceral opinion, as modified by 
shrill and insistent campaigning!. 
It is odd, in looking at the re- 
sults, then, over the years, to dis- 
cover that this method is obvious- 
ly at least as accurate as any 
other could be. There are always 
possible quibbles and cavils, and 
there have been some monument- 
al miscarriages, but it all does work 
out in the end; no one who has a 
Nebula dr a Hugo on his mantle- 
piece can allow himself the feel- 
ing that this is something to be 
taken lightly. 

No, writing is not to be taken 
lightly. Even the hacks cringe, and 
if they can feel it, you bet your 
boots it’s there to be felt. Writing 

GALAXY 



is not to be taken lightly. But 
being a writer is nothing special. 
Anybody who gets out of bed and 
goes to work every morning meets 
all the standards; the rest is 
gravy. Not champagne, and for 
sure, not nectar. Gravy 

This is beginning to look like 
an extremely good year for writ- 
ers. It may even be the harbinger 
of an age. 

The book that directly inspires 
this thought is John Brunner’s 
Stand on Zanzibar, coming in on 
top of Delany’s Nova, and the ex- 
cellent Niven, Silverberg and Ze- 
lazny books of recent months. 
Zanzibar, a big brute of a thing 
at $6.95 for 500 pages from Dou- 
bleday, takes your breath away. 
It is beyond detailed quibble. 

Brunner has always been smart, 
well educated, and intelligent — 
three different but related things. 
All of his ability is brought to 
bear here; considered as a techni- 
cal exercise, or as a conceptuali- 
zation, or as a reading experience, 
Zanzibar is a lesson. It tells you 
part of its story as narrative, part 
of it as footnotes to history, part 
of it as snatches of broadcast, and 
aU of it, putting itself together 
seemingly without effort (the 



in order to convince a brain that 
what it perceives is real, as dis- 
tinguished from plausible. By the 
time you get through this book, 
Brunner has applied them all. 

So far, so good. Brunner has, 
as one might have expected, 
emerged as a masterly technician, 
equal to Clarke — better than 
Clarke — equal to Heinlein. More 
consistent than Heinlein. 

Brunner Has also long display- 
ed a streak of humanism; text- 
book Humanism. “I love you be- 
cause you are deserving” is not 
a direct quote from his previous 
writings, but it comes quite close 
to being one. 

The single most amazing thing 
about Zanzibar is that Pinocchio 
has come alive. The dowels are 
out of his joints, and the vamisK 
gone from his Handclasp. If there 
is one paramount thing this book 
expresses — and it expresses a 
great many, really — it is unqual- 
ified love, and intelligent concern. 
That’s exactly 180 degrees from 
how it’s been up to now. 

The world of this novel is, as

THE MAN INSIDE 



by BRUCE McALLISTER 



His mind was locked tight against 
a world he couldn't tolerate — and 
now it was being forced to open ! 



T am ten and a Half years old, 
and I must be important be- 
cause I’m tKe only boy tfiey let 
into tfiis laboratory of the Hospi- 
tal. My fatEer is in the otKer 
room of this laboratory. He’s 
what Dr. Plankt calls a “cataton- 
ic,” because Dad just sits in one 
position all the time like Ke can’t 
make up His mind wHat to do. 
And tKat makes Dr. Plankt sad, 
but today Dr. Plankt is Happy be- 



cause of His new machine and 
wKat it will do with Dad. 

Dr. Plankt said, “This is tKe 
first time a computor will be able 
to articulate a man’s thougfits.” 
TKat means that wfien they put 
the “electrodes” (those are wires) 
on Dad’s head, and the “elec- 
trodes” are somehow attached to 
Dr. Plankt’s big machine with 
the spinning tapes on it, that ma- 
chine will tell us what’s in Dad’s 



141 



Sead. Dr. Plankt also said, ‘"lo- 
day we dredge tKe virgin silence 
cf an in-state catatonic for tlie 
first time in history.” So Dr, 
Plankt is Happy today. 

I am too, for Dad, because Ke 
will be Helped by tfiis “experi- 
ment” (everything tHat’s Happen- 
ing today) and for Dr. Plankt, 
wKo is good to me. He Kelps make 
my “ulcer” (a Hurting sore inside 
me) feel better, and He also gives 
me pills for my “Hypertension” 
(wKat’s wrong witH my body). 
He told me, “Your fatKer Has an 
ulcer like yours, KeitK, and Hy- 
pertension too, so we’ve got to 
keep care of you. You’re mucH 
too young to be carrying an ulcer 
around in you. Look at your fa- 
tKer now. We don’t want wKat 
Happened to your father to Hap- 
pen. ...” 

He didn’t finisH wKat Ke was 
saying, so I didn’t understand 
all of it. Just tKat I should keep 
KealtKy and calm down and not 
worry. I’m a lot like Dad, I know 
that much’. Even if Dad worried 
a lot before he became a “cataton- 
ic” and I don’t worry mucH be- 
cause I don’t Have many thing to 
worry about. “Yet,” Dr. Plankt 
told me. 

We’re waiting for the big “com- 
putor” to tell us wKat’s in Dad’s 
head! A few minutes ago Dr. 
Plankf said that His macKine might 
Help; His “theory’ (a buncH of 
thougHts) about “personality 
142 



symmetry in correlation with 
schizophrenia.” He didn’t tell me 
wKat He meant by that because Ke 
wasn’t talking to me wKen He 
said it. He was talking to another 
doctor, and I was just listening. 
I think wHat He said Has to do 
with Dad’s personality, wHicH 
Mom says is rotten because He’s 
always so groucKy and nervous 
and picky. Mom says I sKouldn’t 
ever be like Dad. SHe’s always 
telling me that, and sHe shouts a 
lot. 

Except wKen sHe brings people 
Home from her meetings. 

I don’t think Dr. Plankt likes 
Mom. Once Dr. Plankt came over 
to our House, which is on Cypress 
Street, and Mom was at one of 
Her meetings, and Dr. Plankt and 
I sat in tKe living room and talk- 
ed. I said, “It’s funny How both 
Dad and me Have ulcers and Hy- 
pertension. Like father, like son. 
Mom says that. It’s kind of fun- 
ny.” Dr. Plankt got mad at sorae- 
thing then and said to me, “It’s 
not funny KeitK! WitH wKat sHe’s 
doing to you botH, your mother, 
not your fatKer, is tKe one who 
sHould be in a mental inst — ” 
He didn’t finisH His last word, and 
I don’t know wHat it was and 
wHat Ke was mad about. Maybe 
Ke was mad at me. 

Many times Dr. Plankt says 
that He wants to take me away 
from Cypress Street, and put me 
in a better — 



GALAXY 



W ait! The computer just 
typed something! It works 
just like a typewriter but without 
anyone’s hands on it. The v/ords 
it is tjrping are from Dad’s Head! 
Dr. Plankt has the piece of paper 
in iiis Hands now. He’s showing 
it to three doctors. Now He’s 
sh’owring it to Mom. Mom is start- 
ing to cry! I’ve never seen her 
cry before. I want to see the 
words from Dad’s head! 

Another doctor is looking at 
me, and he has the paper now. I 
say, “Can I see it! Can I see it?” 
He looks at me again, and I 
tliink he knows who I am because 
Dr. Plankt talks about me a lot 
to everyone. I must be important. 
I don’t like the look on this other 
doctor’s face. It’s like the look Un- 
cle Josh gets when he’s feeling sad 
about something. This other doc- 
tor closes his eyes for a minute, 
and comes over to me with the pa- 
per. The paper, the paper! The 
words from Dad’s Head. The 
words are: 



OH OH 
MY MY 
WIFE, SON! 

I I 

CERTAINLY CERTAINLY 
DO DO 
NOT NOT 
WANT WANT 
TO TO 
LIVE DIE! 



When I squint my eyes and 
look at these words from Dad’s 
head, they look like a man in a 
hat with his arms out, kind of 
like Dad — except that there’s a 
split down the middle of this 
man. 

It’s funny, but I know just how 
Dad feels.

derelict suddenly comes to life. 
He totters to a sauna, sits soaking 
in the steam longer than any hu- 
man being should be able to, 
emerges looking decades younger. 
A doctor observes with incredu- 
lity as the man’s scars disappear 
and an ugly cyst on his back 
changes shape and pops out a 
corroded old Minie ball oi Civil 
War vintage; the man will an- 
swer no questions, but goes out 
into the night on an urgent and 
unexplained errand. 

At Caine Island, the oldest 
prisoner in the place, who has 
been there so long no one remem- 
bers his crime or when he came, 
breaks free oi two armed guards 
and dives into the sea. 

And in the ocean oii the Flor- 
ida coast, a hurricane begins to 
form — but a hurricane such as 
no man has ever seen : motionless, 
in a position that makes no mete- 
orological sense, and huger than 
any storm on record. 

The two strange men race to- 
ward a common destination, 
though neither knows that the 
other exists. Strange memories oi 
ancient Viking days come to them 
— tall primitive warriors, some- 
how linked with a thinking, su- 
perpoweriul starship and a terri- 
iying werebeast that slew help- 
less humans, centuries beiore. 

Like the ex-derelict the ior- 
mer prisoner grows stronger and 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



younger as he moves. He iinds a 
girl who helps him escape the 
police roadblocks; together they 
steal a car, abandon it, steal a 
plane, crash it. Both are badly 
hurt, but the man’s amazing re- 
cuperative powers let him go on 
toward his destination. 

The ex-derelict too has found 
an ally: a cab driver whom he 
has hired as chauHeur and help- 
er. But the police are on the trail 
of both of them now, and even 
the U.S. Army has been called in. 

For the Pasmaquoddy gener- 
ators have gone berserk. In an at- 
tempt to halt the storm that is 
lashing all the eastern coast of 
North America with deadly winds 
and flooding rain, the power-sta- 
tion manager has shut off the 
broadcast oi energy. But it will 
not stay oft. Relays weld them- 
selves shut, fuses flash over, dead- 
ly forces destroy the power-sta- 
tion workers who are trying to 
bring it back under control. They 
fail, and call on the Army for as- 
sistance — while the men, one on 
foot, the other in a stolen Army 
transport, ate coming toward the 
station.

Heavy vehicle sank deeper into

bioken rock that liad Halted the 
slow upward climb. 

“This is as fas astfiis bucket 
goes,” Zabisky said. In the pale 
glow of die instrumental lights. 
His round face sKone witK sweat. 
“Now wfiat?” 

Falconer upstrapped, swung 
open the steel door, stepped down 
into a soup of muck and broken 
rock. He scanned tKe Horizon all 
around, then reacHed back in the 
vehicle to switch off tHe Hooded 
driving lights. In tHe abrupt dark- 
ness, a faint glow was visible in 
tfie sky tKrougK the trees cloth- 
ing the slope to the left. 

“A little reconnaissance,” Fal- 
coner said. He made His way up 
through brush to the ridge, look- 
ed down across tHe spread of dark 
countryside at a rectilinear ar- 
rangement of lights perhaps two 
miles away. Other, smaller lights 
ringed tHe central concentration 
in a loose circle a mile in diame- 
ter. 

Zabisky arrived, puffing. 
“Brother, you move fast in the 
dark.” He stared in the direction 
Falconer was looking. 

“Wfiat’s that? Looks like some 
kind of plant. This what we been 
looking for?” 

“No.” 

“Funny place for a factory, out 
in tHe sticks fifty miles from no 
place.” 

Ligfit winked brilliantly below: 
once, twice, three times. Some of 
146 



the lights of the central installa- 
tion faded. 

“Hey — what gives?” Zabisky 
grunted. A dull caizump, car- 
rump . catmmp floated up to 
them. 

“Artillery fire,” Falconer said, 
and turned away. 

“Look pal, you ain’t Here to 
get mixed up with tKe Army, I 
Hope?” 

“By no means.” 

“Maybe you better tell me 
what this is all about. Huh? I 
don’t want to get tfie US Infan- 
try mad at me. I’m pretty dumb, 
but there’s got to be a connection: 
you busting a gut to get to tfiis 
patcH of noplace just when some- 
body starts shooting. What are 
you, some kind of foreign spy? 
Or what?” 

Falconer turned to Zabisky. 
“You better go back, John. I’m 
going on from here on foot — 
alone.” 

“Hey, wait a minute,” Zabisky 
protested. “Just like that, you’re 
going to walk off into the woods?” 

“That’s right, John. You can 
make it back to the road by 
dawn.” 

“Have a heart. Mister.” Zab- 
isky protested. “I come this far, 
what’s all this? What’s the shoot- 
ing?” 

“Good-by, John.” Falconer 
turned and started upslope, fol- 
lowing a faint foot path, angling 
away from the lights below. Za-

bisky called after him, but he 
ignored his shouts. 

CCXrou’re a fool if you think 
I’m going to help you, 
Max,” Hardman said. 

“Don’t call me Max, we’re not 
on 6aat kind of terms.” The pris- 
oner smiled a gaimt smile. He 
was sitting at ease in the big 
leather chair beside Hardman’s 
desk, puffing one of Hardman’s 
cigarets. The muzzle of the big- 
calibre solid-slug pistol rested on 
tlie desk, aimed at Hardman’s 
chest. “It’s Mr. Wiston — or 
just Wiston. And you’ll do like 
I say. Warden.” He had a deep 
gravelly voice, soft but penetrat- 
ing. 

Hardman shook His head. “I 
couldn’t get you out of prison 
even if I wanted to. Max,” lie 
said easily. “And I don’t want 
to." 

“Warden, you think I wouldn’t 
shoot you as soon as look at 
you?” Wiston’s voice was mild, 
his tone curious. 

“Sure, you’d shoot me if you 
thougiit it would buy you your 
freedom. But you know it would 
all be over for you if you shot 
me. in cold blood. I’m your one 
chance to get clear — you think. 
But you’re wrong.” 

“For God’s sake. Governor,” 
Lester Pale whispered from the 
chair against the wall where Wis- 
ton had ordered him to sit, “You 
148 



convince him of that and he’ll 
kill you out of hand!” 

“No he won’t,” Hardman said. 
“He knows I’m the only one who 
can Kelp Him — if not to escape, 
at least to baU him out of some 
of the trouble lie’s gotten Himself 
into tonight.” 

“Warden, you talk too much,” 
Wiston said. “I’ll tell you just 
how it is; I’ve waited ten years 
for this cKance, I’m riding it all 
the way. Maybe it’s true what 
you say about all the fancy safe- 
ty gadgets and automatic traps 
and that — but I’d as lief be dead 
as stay in this box any longer. 
We’re walking out of here, me 
and you, win, lose or draw. So 
maybe you better do wKat you 
can to get those gates open. ’Cause 
I’m not going back in that cell 
block alive, ever. And if I have 
to die, I’m taking you along. I 
promise you that, Warden.” 

“He means it. Governor,’,’ Pale 
said. 

“The pansy’s right,” Wiston 
said, smiling. “Now let’s get mov- 
ing. I’m getting restless. I want 
to smell that fresh air. Warden, 
see that open sky, feel that rain 
on my face.” He stood abruptly, 
motioning witH the gun. Hard- 
man didn’t move. Wiston swung 
the gun to one side and without 
looking fired a round into the 
wall two feet from Lester Pale’s 
chair. 

“Next one hits meat. Warden.”

Hardman stood. 

“This won’t work, Max,” he 
paid. “It’s Hopeless.” 

“Sure. Let’s go.” 

T n the corridor, sounds of distant 
shouting were audible. 

“I set ’em to raising Kell down 
in the service wings,” Wiston said. 
“That’ll keep your screws tied up 
whilst you and me try the back 
way.” 

“What back way?” 

“The water gate, Warden. That 
was always tiie weak spot Here at 
Caine. Could never dope the tun- 
nel, though. But you’ll get me 
through. You’ll say all the right 
tilings and get me through.” 

“Then what? The road only 
leads to Gull Key.” 

“There’s a lot of water out 
there. Warden. I’m a strong swim- 
mer. And I know these waters. I 
fished amongst these islands for 
a many a year before ever they 
built the prison. Don’t worry 
about me. Warden. I’ll be fine, 
just fine.” 

“In this storm you’ll drown be- 
fore you’ve swum a hundred 
yards.” 

“Don’t talk. Warden. Just lead 
the way.” 

In silence, Hardman pushed 
through the stairwell door. In 
darkness, he descended, feeling 
his way. Wiston’s footsteps fol- 
lowed directly behind him. At the 
bottom, he felt over the wall, 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



found the door that opened into 
the Processing Room. 

“There may be some of my men 
in here,” he said. “I hope you 
have sense enough not to start 
shooting, Max.” 

“We’ll see.” Hardman opened 
the door; it swung in on darkness. 

“Now what?” he said. “Neither 
of us can see — ” 

Wiston’s fingers touched lilm, 
hooked his belt. “You know the 
layout, Warden. Just keep going. 
When I’m unhappy you’ll hear 
this gun go off. Or will you? You 
know what they say about the 
one that kills you.” 

Hardman tried to remember the 
layout of the room. The person- 
nel doors were to the right . 
about there. He moved forward 
cautiously, the other man at his 
heels. His hands touched brick- 
work. He explored, found the cold 
steel of the door. It swung open 
at his touch. Chill air moved 
around his face. The sounds of 
the storm were louder now. 

“Good work. Warden. I can 
smell the Gulf.” 

“This is the garage,” Hardman 
said. “The only exit is through 
the big doors. They’re power op- 
erated. This is the end of the line, 
Max.” 

A beam of light speared out 
from the left. Hardman whirled, 
shouted, “Douse that, you damn 
fool!” 

The boom of the gun racketed 

149 



and ecKoed in the enclosed space. 
TKe flashlight dropped to the 
floor and rolled, throwing its 
beam across the oil-stained con- 
crete floor. TKere was a heavy, 
complicated sound of a body fall- 
ing against the side of a vehicle, 
sliding down to the floor, a gargly 
rattle of exhaled air. 

tC|^on’t move. Warden,” Wis- 
ton said calmly. “I’m go- 
ing to pick up the light.” 

Hardman heard soft, quick 
steps. The light swung up, flicked 
across him, on across to the spot 
where a man in coveralls lay on 
his face between two armored per- 
sonnel carriers in a widening pool 
of black-red blood. 

“Too bad,” Wiston said. “I did 
not mean that feller no harm, but 
he shouldn’t of put the light on 
me thataway.” He shone the light 
on the big garage doors, up one 
side, across the top, down the 
other. 

“Okay, your time, Warden. Get 
’em open.” 

“I told you — ” 

“Reckon there’s a manual rig 
someplace. Better find it.” 

“Find it yourself, Wiston.” 
“You’re a funny one, Warden. 
You saw me, just now. You know 
I’m not bashful about using the 
gun. You figure you’re bullet- 
proof?” 

“I’m here to keep cold-blood- 
ed tdllers like you out of circula- 
150 



tion, Wiston, not to lead you out- 
side and wave bye-bye.” 

Wiston laughed. “You’re a 
harder nut than you look, old 
man. But I wonder, are you as 
hard as you talk?” The convict 
held the flashlight beam on Hard- 
man’s right knee. “I count five. 
Then I put a bullet where the 
light is. After that, I ask you 
again.” He cleared his throat, 
spat, began to count. 

Hardman waited until tlie 
count of four, another half sec- 
ond, then pivoted, dropped to- 
ward the floor as the gun boom- 
ed. A red-hot sledge hammer 
struck him behind the right knee, 
flipped him. His face hit hard, 
skidding on the concrete. There 
seemed to be a spike driven into 
the back of his leg. He tried to 
draw a breath to yell, tried to get 
his hand on the spike to pull it 
out — 

“Stop flopping. Warden. I 
Should of killed you for that trick, 
but you’re just winged.” 

^'T^he light was dazzling in Hard- 
man’s eyes, growing and re- 
ceding. Blood pounded in liis 
head. Sickness swelled inside him. 
Pain rolled out in white-hot 
waves from his shattered knee. 
He hardly heard Wiston’s voice. 
He lay on his side, his cheek 
against the floor, clutching his 
leg. 

“Now you better just tell me 
GALAXY 



about tHat door. Warden.” THe 
Jnan was standing over Him; lie 
saw tKe dusty, dark-blue legs of 
tKe prison trousers, tKe sturdy 
sfioes through a veil of agony. 

“Go . Hell . i. ” he man- 
aged. 

TKe feet went away. There were 
sounds, thumping, tKe rattle of 
Jmetal, curses. Then a grunt of 
satisfaction; a steady ratcheting 
noise started up, accompanied by 
Heavy breathing. Cold wet air 
was sweeping in across the floor; 
the shrill of wind and the drum- 
ming of rain were abruptly loud- 
er. The ratcheting ceased. 

Hardman tried to roll over on 
his back, succeeded in banging 
his head against the floor. He 
forced his hands, slippery with 
blood, away from his wound, 
pushed himself to a sitting posi- 
tion. TKe man Wiston had shot 
lay ten feet from, Kim, visible by 
the light of the flash which Wis- 
ton had placed on the floor. TKe 
garage door had been raised a foot 
and a half. Wiston had picked up 
the light, was sliding under the 
door. He cleared it, got to his feet, 
moving away. 

Abruptly, bright, hard flashes 
of light winked, the stutter of au- 
tomatic weapons racketed in the 
drive well, casting shadows that 
moved like silent movie actors. 
Lying on the floor just inside the 
door, Hardman saw a man walk- 
ing toward him. The man slowed, 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



knelt slowly, fell forward on Kis 
face. Other men were coming; 
bright li^ts glared, reflecting 
from wet pavement. Voices called 
out. Wiston lay on his face a 
yard from Hardman. His hands 
groped over the pavement. He 
lifted Kis head and looked into 
Hardman’s eyes. 

“Someplace,” Ke said. “Some- 
time, there’s got . got to be 
. be . some justice. ...” 
His face hit the pavement. 

A foot turned Wiston over. The 
rain fell on his wide-open eyes. 

“Did you get that?” someone 
said. “He goes out talking about 
justice. A punk like that.” 

There was something that 
Hardman wanted to say then, 
something of vast importance that 
Ke had tried all Kis life to imder- 
stand and that now, in this in- 
stant, was clear to hint. But when 
Ke opened his mouth, darkn^ 
filled his brain and swept Kim 
away into a black maelstrom of 
roaring waters. 

P rivate Abers, Ewen J., ASN 
3783746353, of the 3rd Com- 
pany, First Batallion, paused in 
the lee of one of the big trees to 
wipe the icy rain water from his 
face and try one more time to ad- 
just the collar of the G.I. rain- 
coat to prevent the cold trickle 
down the back of His neck. He 
propped his M-3 carbine against 
the tree, imdid the top button 

151 



Vifitii cold-numbed fingers, turn- 
ed up the collar of the field jack- 
et under the coat, rebuttoned the 
coat It felt colder and clammier 
tlian ever, but it was the best 
He could do. He considered pull- 
ing off Kis boots to empty the wa- 
ter from them, but what the hell; 
diley’d Just fiU up again. Every 
third step was into a gully with 
water anywhere from ankle to 
knee deep. Obers peered through 
the darkness for signs of the pla- 
toon. Pitdier had told them to 
keep it closed up while they 
worked their way upslope from 
die road where they’d left the 
eiK-by’s. He hadn’t seen Dodge 
or Shapiro, the men on his left 
and right, since they’d hit the 
rough ground. But at least you 
couldn’t get lost; not if you just 
kept climbing. 

Obers wished briefly that he 
v/ere back in the barracks, racked 
out on his bunk, reading a maga- 
zine and eating a candy bar; 
&en He slung the carbine and 
stepped out to face the rain anew. 

There was a movement above 
him. 

“Shapiro?” His call was muffed 
by tlie storm. 

There was no answer; but 
above, a dark shape moved, low 
to the ground, big — too big to 
be Shapiro — or Dodge; and why 
was the guy crawling? Obers halt- 
ed, feeling a sudden prickling at 
the back of his neck — not that 
152 



he believed in spooks. « . 

“All right, who’s there?” He 
yelled against the rain. 

No answer. The big shape — ■ 
well over six feet long — flowed 
downward toward him. For art 
instant, Obers thought he caught 
a gleam of light reflected from 
yellow-green eyes. He swung the 
carbine around, jacked the load- 
ing lever, aimed it from the hip, 
and pulled the trigger. 

Nothing happened; the trigger 
was locked hard. Panic flooded 
up in Obers. Safety’s on! the 
words popped into his! mind; but 
his finger was locked on the trig- 
ger, squeezing until the metal cut 
into his flesh. And the dark shape 
was rising, flowing outward and 
down toward him. 

In the last split second, he tried 
to scream, but there was no 
breath in his lungs. Then the 
weight struck him, threw him 
down and back. He felt some- 
thing icy cold rake across his 
throat, felt a remote pain that 
was hardly noticeable in the great- 
er agony of the need for air. Some- 
thing scarlet red dazzled before 
his eyes, grew until it was a sun- 
burst that filled the world, then 
slowly faded into an endless dark- 
ness. 

n a clearing in the forest 
stands a tall man with a 
mane of flame-red hair, dressed 
in garments of green leather and 

GALAXY 



a surcoat of bull ornamented 
with a white bird with spread 
wings. A two-handed sword with 
a jeweled pommel hangs at his 
side. A bow is slung at his back. 
He wears a heavy gauntlet on his 
left hand, on which is perched a 
white hawk, from whose head the 
'man has just removed a hood of 
soft leather. With a lift of his 
wrist, the man tosses the bird 
high; it gives a piercing cry and 
circles high into the air. 

“My lord’s power over a wild 
bird is a thing to wonder at,” 
murmurs one of a huddle of serfs 
watching from concealment. 

“Indeed, ’tis a matter passing 
Christian understanding,” another 
comments. 

“I’ve heard it said,” says an- 
other, “that the bird is a were- 
creature, a man enchanted.” 

“Aye, ’tis his own brother, some 
say — ” 

“Nay, not his brother; him he 
slew in battle before the eyes of 
all his men.” 

“But by the virtue of Christ, 
the slain brother rose and walked 
again — ” 

“ — and ’twas then he enchant- 
ed him into the form of the white 
falcon — ” 

“Old w/Ves’ tales,” says the 
first man who spoke, a dark man 
with strange yellow eyes. “My 
Lord Lohengrin is no magician, 
but a true knecht.” 

“Bah! What do you ktrow?” 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



speaks up on oldster with a strag- 
gly yellow beard. “I served 'lum 
in your granfer’s time, and with 
my own eyes oft have I seen Him 
quaff deep of the waters of eter- 
nal youth. For does he not — 
aye, and the bird as well — ap- 
pear today as he did then, when 
I ivas a lusty stripling?” 

“You lusty, Brecht? When was 
that, before or after the Flood 
of Noah?” 

When the furtive laughter dies, 
a man who has not spoken tugs 
at his ear portentiously. “Aye, 
laugh,” he says. “But in truth you 
are all wide of the mark. The 
bird is no man ensorceled.’’ 

The others look at him with 
slack jaws. 

“’Tis a woman, Leda by name, 
a humble maid who spurned my 
Lord’s base advances. This I 
know, for gospel fact, because 
she was the sister of a cousin of 
a close friend — ” 

“Bah!” scoffs the elder. “If 
’twere a woman, she would take 
the shape of a swan, not a hunt- 
ing falcon, any fool knows that.” 
“So you do,” the other says 
sharply. “But a wise man knows 
better.” 

They fall silent as the hunt- 
er turns and looks across at them 
with cold blue eyes that penetrate 
to their hiding place. 

“You are all wide of the mark,” 
he says in a voice like the ring 
of cold iron. “The bird is only a 

153 



bkd; my brother is a mad do^; 
and as for yourself — I am a 
dead man.” 

As one, the gaggle of villager 
whirl and pelt away through the 
underbrush. The falconet smiles 
a lean smile, stands looking up at 
the sky where the white bird cir- 
cles on a rising current of air.

G rayle Had covered twelve 
miles in less tKan an Eour, 
running steadily across tiie dark, 
rain-swept fields, ignoring tKe pain 
pain from his side. Now, in the 
ground below the higK rampart of 
the hills, he found his progress 
slowed. It was necessary to pick 
his way, splashing through rush- 
ing torrents of muddy water flow- 
ing down over the barrier of botd- 
ders deposited ten thousand years 
ago by the glacier. Once He 
paused, listening to the sound of 
what seemed to be heavy gunfire 
in the distance, but the sound 
was not repeated. Minutes later, 
he became aware of men moving 
on the slope ahead and to his left. 
The ground was steep here, a 
rubble-heap of rock fallen from 
the steep cliffs above; the men 
were noisy, calling to each other, 
occasionally flailing Hand-lights 
across the slope, through the 
scrub pines that had foimd a foot- 
hold here. It was apparent that 
they were soldiers. A sergeant 
154 



barked angry orders for silence to 
the members of the Third Pla- 
toon. 

Grayle skirted the men, who 
were working their way south- 
ward, to his left, and continued 
Ks climb, facing into the driving 
rain. 

He was close now. It would 
not be much longer before he 
knew if he had been in time. 

/^utside the unceasing storm 
buffeted the thick walls; in- 
side, the generator chugged, the 
stink of exhaust fumes hung in 
the stale air. Hardman lay on a 
field cot s,et up in his office, his 
right leg heavily bandaged. 

“You look bad. Governor,” 
Brasher said, frowning. “You 
ought to be — ” 

“Skip all that. Let’s have that 
report.” 

“Well — if you tliink you’re 
competent — that is, feeling Well 
enough — ” 

“The report. Brasher.” Hard- 
man’s voice was tight with pain. 
“You like to deliver reports, re- 
member? It gives you a chance 
to sound like Moses — or is it 
God in person?” 

“Look Here — ” Brasher start- 
ed angrily. 

“That’s an order. Captain!” 
Hardman’s snarl overrode the 
other. 

Brasher’s face twitched angrily. 
“I was thinking of your welfare, 

GALAXY 



r 



Governor. However, as you in- 
sist,” he hurried on. “You know 
about the car theft and assault 
in Brooksville. Well, that was 
just a warmup, it seems. Our man 
proceeded to Gainesville, attack- 
ed two patrolmen and stole their 
car, drove it to the downtown 
police helicopter facility, and pro- 
ceeded to hijack a high-speed mil- 
itary recon machine.” 

“Who told you this cock-and- 
bull story?” Hardman cut in. 
“Captain Lacey. And — ” 
“All right. He drove into the 
middle of a heavily manned pol- 
ice installation, borrowed a cop- 
ter and took off in a hurricane. 
Anything else?” 

“The copter was followed on 
radar; it headed northwest. The 
plot was passed to Eglin, and on 
to other bases along the route. 
They tracked him to within a 
hundred miles of the Canadian 
border. Then someone — Wash- 
ington, I think — scrambled 
fighters out of Great Lakes. They 
forced him down in rough coun- 
try in northern Minnesota.’,’ 
“You’re serious about this?” 
“Dead serious.” 

“And where is He now?” 

“He got clear. But they got 
the girl.” 

“What girl?” 

“His accomplice. The one who 
helped him escape.” 

“What has she told them?” 
Brasher shook his head. “I un- 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



derstand she was pretty badly 
shaken up in the crash.” 

“You said he got clear. Weren’t 
they covering tlie ground?” 
“Certainly. But that’s a big 
country.” 

“He’s alone and unarmed, 
probably injured. He should be 
easy enough to take.” 

tCTl^ell, as to that — I should 
’ ' point out that there are 
a couple of confusing points. It 
seems there’s a report of a man 
answering Grayle’s description at- 
tacking two police officers at the 
scene of an auto accident.” 
“Near the crash scene?” 
“About seventy miles south- 
west.” 

“How does the time tie in?” 
“The crash occurred at 4:07. 
This other item was about an 
hour later, at 5:01 A.M.” 

“So now he’s in two places at 
once,” Hardman snorted. “What 
makes you think there’s any con- 
nection? There are thousands of 
men who answer Grayle’s general 
description.” 

“Not that can tear the door off 
a car,” Brasher said, looking side- 
ways at Hardman. 

“What does that mean?” 

“The FBI looked the car over 
— the one that was wrecked. It 
was one of theirs. It was tailing 
Grayle. The door was ripped from 
its hinges. And there were finger- 
marks in the metal.”

Hardman was propped on one 
elbow. “And?” he prompted. 

“He assaulted the police as I 
said, and left the scene in his 
car. Twenty miles up the road, 
He and his accomplice — ” 

“A girl?” 

“No, a man. They hit an Army 
roadblock, attacked a couple of 
soldiers, and stole a military ve- 
hicle. A halftrack, I think it was.” 
“All this, less than an hour 
after he crashed a stolen police 
copter in another place, accom- 
panied by a woman. Quite a trick, 
eh, Brasher? A real superman, 
this fellow — either that, or the 
police forces of this country are 
a collection of idiots!” 

“I know it sounds crazy.” 
Brasher waved his hands. “But 
these are the facts reported to 
me! This man gets around faster 
than a dirty rumor! It has to be 
Grayle! Sure, anybody could 
Have grey hair and a red stubble, 
but who else could tear steel with 
his bare hands? Unless — ” 
Brasher looked startled. 

A minute ago you said some- 
thing about a superman. Gover- 
nor,” he said. “What would you 
say to two supermen?” 

“I don’t know. Brasher.” 
“Well, I’ll be getting along. 
Governor.” Brasher glanced at 
the big gold strap-watcH on his 
nude wrist. “Things are breaking 
fast; there’ll no doubt be an arrest 
at any moment.” 

156 



“Brasher,” Hardman called as 
the policeman turned away. 
“When they catch him — either 
or both of him — I want him 
taken alive.” 

Brasher looked grave. “Well, 
now. Governor, as we agreed ear- 
lier, we don’t want to place any 
obstacles in the path of law en- 
forcement — ” 

“I said alive, Brasher!” 

“What if this mad dog begins 
shooting down more police offi- 
cers? What are they supposed'to 
do? Turn the other cheek?” 
“Alive, Brasher,” Hardman re- 
peated. “Now get out. And may- 
be you’d better tell that doctor to 
call the hospital after all.” 
Outside, Lester Pale was wait- 
ing. He raised his eyebrows. 

“Nothing,” Brasher said brisk- 
ly. “He was conscious — just 
barely. He didn’t say anything 
that made sense.” 

“No change in the orders? I 
Had the idea — ” 

“No change,” Brasher snapped. 
“I’m a cop, remember? My job 
is to catch crooks, that’s all.” 

TTalfway up the hill where he 
-*■ had abandoned the half- 
track, Falconer lay flat on wet 
ground among dense-growing 
brush. From the darkness aKead 
and to the left came the sounds 
of a man forcing his way through 
tKe growth. Other sounds of pas- 
sage came from the right, along 

GAIAXY 



witli tKe occasional gleam of a 
flasHligHt Gradually, the sound? 
receded as the men passed Ky, 
moving diagonally to his course. 
Falconer rose, gained another fif- 
ty feet, tifien paused, head up, 
sniffing the air. Cautiously, He 
advanced, skirting a giant tree. 
Tfie ^arp, metallic odor he Had 
noticed grew rapidly stronger. 
Tfien he saw the body. 

It was a soldier, sprawled at 
tfie base of tfie big pine, Hands 
OUtflung, one leg doubled xmder 
Him. Tfie front of tfie man’s rain- 
coat was sliredded; pale skirt 
slasfied by deep cuts sfiowed 
through tfie rents. Above, tfie 
throat was gasfied from ear to ear 
ear, not once but in three paral- 
lel wounds. Tfie ground under tfie 
man was a gluey soup of blood 
and muck. 

For half a minute. Falconer 
Studied tfie corpse and tfie ground 
around it tfirougfi narrowed eyes. 
Then he went on. 

^^ech Sergeant Duane Pitcher 
I of tfie Third Platoon was dis- 
gusted. For th’e past hour, ever 
since tliey’d left tfie vehicles on 
tfie road below, fie’d been stum- 
bling around half frozen in tfie 
poiuing rain in these damned 
pitcH-black woods, trying to fol- 
low orders to make no noise and 
show no lights, and to keep tfie 
men spread out in some kind of 
skirmish line, and keep ’em mov- 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



ing up toward tfie position tfie 
lieutenant had sfiowed him on the 
contour map. In tlus soup he’d 
be lucky to get witlun a mile of 
it. It was bad enough just to 
climb tfiese dananed slippery rocks 
tfirougfi this damned slippery 
mud, but fie Had to be in twenty 
places at once because otherwise 
tfie eager beavers like Obers 
would be a hundred yards out in 
front, and goldbricks like Bloom 
and Ginty would flake out and 
wind up back at tfie trucks, 
claiming they got lost 
Pitcher saw a dim movement 
ahead, called, got an answer in 
a deep-soutfi rumble. 

“Okay, Hold it up Here, Brown. 
We don’t want to run into tfie 
Second Platoon coming down.” 
He moved obliquely across the 
slope, made contact with two 
more men. 

“Where’s Obers?” lie asked a 
two-striper. 

“Hell, Sarge, where’s anybody 
in this stuff?” 

Pitcher grunted. “Okay, fiold 
the platoon where they’re at. 
Lieutenant Boyd’s supposed to 
make contact on tlie left before 
we top tfie ridge. I got to look for 
Obers before fie walks down and 
gets a 100mm in his lap.” 

“What was tfie firing, Sarge?” 
“How do I know?” Pitcher 
moved up along a faint path 
through the trees. He had covered 
seventy yards when Ke tripped 

157 



over an obstruction at the base 
of a big pine. Pitcher’s training 
was good. As he stumbled, He 
swung the carbine from his sKoul- 
der, Hit tHe ground and rolled, 
came to rest in firing position, 
gun aimed, safety off. 

Notfiing moved. TKere was no 
sound but the Howl of wind, tHe 
crash of rain. He Hadn’t liked the 
feel of what fie Had stepped on. 
It was too soft, too yielding. It 
felt like. 

He undipped tlie flasfi at fiis 
belt, flicked it in tfie direction of 
the tree. It sKone on a booted foot. 
Tfie rest of tiie man was tfiere, 
too, lying on fiis back. It was 
Obers. Pitcfier held tfie light on 
tfie torn throat, the lacerated 
cfiest. 

For a long moment he field tfie 
ligfit on tfie dead man. Tfien he 
shifted the beam, shone it around 
Him into tfie high darkness of the 
forest. Tfiere was notfiing but wet 
trees, wet rock. Tfien a sound 
came from his elbow: tfie snap 
of a sodden twig, the slither of 
shoes in mud, tfie scrape of leatfi- 
er against rock. Pitcfier switched 
off tfie light, dropped it, fitted 
tfie stock of the carbine against fiis 
cheek, his finger on tfie trigger. 

A man appeared, toiling up- 
ward through the trees. He was 
a big fellow, dressed in a water- 
proof mackinaw. Wet black hair 
was plastered to his round skull. 
He was Headed straight for tHe 
158 



spot where the body lay. Pitcher 
put the light square in fiis eyes. 

“All right, hold it right there!” 
Pitcher called. At the words, the 
man froze, tfien whirled, jumped 
for the underbrusH. Pitcher’s fin- 
ger jerked; red flame gouted. THe 
shot was a flat bam! against tfie 
background of the storm. The 
man stumbled, caught himself, 
plunged on into the brusK. Pitcher 
fired again into the darkness 
where he Had disappeared, but 
when he came forward to investi- 
gate, tfiere was only a foot-print 
and a splasH of fast-dissolving 
blood to show that there Had been 
a target, and that his bullets had 
found it. 

■p^alconer fiad Halted when fie 
Heard tfie shots, then, hear- 
ing nothing more, resumed his 
climb. THe trail ended on a bare 
slope of stone across whicH water 
sluiced like a spillway. He crossed 
it, hugging the rock, while tfie 
wind drove rain into fiis eyes and 
nose, under his clothes. At tfie up- 
per edge, giant rocks lay tum- 
bled like debris from some gigan- 
tic explosion. Falconer picked fiis 
way up tfirougfi them, and was 
looking down into a Hollow, pool- 
ed with darkness like ink. He took 
a step forward, and abruptly there 
was no rain; the buffeting wind 
was gone. A foot away the storm 
still shrieked, but here the air 
was still warm. There was a soft 

GALAXY 



sound from below; a vertical line 
of yellow light appeared and wid- 
ened, shining out on dry rock, 
reflecting on a sleek curve of age- 
blackened metal. Beyond the 
open doorway gleamed pale green 
walls, polished brightwork. 

“Welcome, Commander Lokri- 
en,” a mellow voice rang out in 
a strange language that for a mo- 
ment Falconer almost failed to 
comprehend. “I have waited long 
for this hour.” 

Q landing in the road beside the 
^ medium tank which, half an 
hour before, had fired three 
rounds of conventional 100mm 
through the main entrance to the 
Upper Pasmaquoddie Power 
Plant, Colonel Ajax Pyler prop- 
ped his fists on his hips and thrust 
his face closer to that of the Di- 
visional Staff Observer. 

“You don’t know the situation, 
Yount!” he snapped. “I saw it 
kill a man right in front of me! I 
talked to the three men that man- 
aged to get clear! I’m telling you 
tliis is more than a malfunction or 
a damn fool plot by a crazy en- 
gineer!” 

“There are some forty civilian 
personnel still inside that build- 
ing, Pyler,” Colonel Yoimt came 
back coolly. “We have only the 
word of a couple of half-hysteri- 
cal civilians that there’s anything 
wrong in there that a platoon of 
foot-soldiers can’t control.” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



“I’m not sending a man of my 
command into that death-trap,” 
Pyler said flatly. “I don’t give a 
damn if the commanding general 
personally wrote out the order in 
his own blood with a bent pen!” 
“Pyler, you’re trigger-happy.” 
“My orders were to shut down 
that transmitter. I intend to do 
just that — any way I can!” 
“That’s a five billion dollar 
Federal installation you’re shell- 
ing man! This isn’t Vietnam. You 
can’t just blow anything that 
gets in your way to kingdom 
come!” 

“I can try!” 

“Before you do,” Yount said 
coldly, “I suggest you think for a 
few moments about trying less 
drastic measures than total de- 
structiwi of the plant.” 

“Who said anything about total 
destruction? I intend to place 
rounds in carefully selected spots, 
as pointed out by my engineers, 
until transmission ceases. Then — ” 
“No, you’re not, Pyler.” Yount 
made a swift motion. The big 
master sergeant who had been 
standing by at parade rest staring 
straight out under the rim of his 
steel helmet came to life. 

“Colonel Pyler, this is Sergeant 
Major Muldoon. He weighs two 
hundred and forty pounds, strip- 
ped, and there’s not an ounce of 
fat on him. I’ve ordered him to 
escort you back to divisional HQ 
to make your report.” 



159 



Pyler’s face went pale, then 
purpled. 

“That is, unless you’re willing 
to listen to reason.” 

Pyler drew a couple of hoarse 
breaths through his nose. 

“What . what do you Have 
in mind?” 

“I want to send a three-man 
team into the plant. Specially 
equipped, of course; I’m not com- 
pletely discounting your descrip- 
tion of conditions inside. It seems 
there are several points at which 
the circuitry can be interrupted 
quite simply.” 

“I told you what Happened to 
that Engineer fellow, Hunnicut, 
and tKe other man. And before 
them there was another — ” 

“I know all about that. I’ve 
talked to Prescott. My men know 
what to do.” 

“Very well,” Pyler said through 
stiff lips. “I’U want written orders 
relieving me, of course.” 

Yount sKook his head. “You’re 
not relieved, Jack. I’m just lend- 
ing what you might call a little 
tecH support from headquarters.” 
He turned away, began giving in- 
structions to a tall, blond-haired 
captain and two noncoms, all in 
black commando assault dress. 

L ieutenant Harmon of the Flor- 
ida State Police was the 
first to spy the abandoned half- 
track, blocking the gullied trail 
above. He and Captain Zwicky 
160 



climbed down from their ma- 
chines, slogged forward, guns in 
hand. 

“Well, what did you expect, to 
find yom man sitting in it eating 
his lunch?” Zwicky asked as Har- 
mon cursed the empty vehicle. 

“The son of a bitch can’t be 
far. Let’s get him!” 

Zwicky squinted up through 
swirling rain at the dark forest 
above. “You think you could find 
him up there?” 

“Got any better ideas?” 
“Maybe.” Zwicky indicated the 
low rise to the east. “The Pas- 
samaquoddie Power Plant’s just 
the other side of the hUl a cou- 
ple of miles. Maybe that’s where 
he was headed.” 

“What the hell would he want 
to go there for?” 

“I don’t know, but there’s some 
kind of trouble over there. That’s 
why the Army’s out in the weath- 
er. Maybe your man Has some- 
thing to do with it.” 

“Like what? For Christ’s sake. 
Captain, this bum is a con on the 
lam, a lousy killer wHo spent His 
life in stir. What — ” 

“I don’t know. But this is the 
only inhabited spot in forty miles; 
this is wild country. Lieutenant. 
And your man headed right for it. 
It’s worth looking into, isn’t it? 
Or are you dead set on climbing 
up there to beat the bushes for 
him — alone? Because this is as 
far as I go,” 



GALAXY 



Harmon looked up toward the 
EeigEts above. 

“WeU — ” 

TEere was a sound from near- 
by — tEe unmistakable double 
clack-clack! of the arming lever 
of a rifle. 

“Freeze right there!” the KarsE 
voice barked from the darkness. 

Harmon dropped his pistol, 
hoisted his hands where he stood, 
his back to tEe voice. Zwicky turn- 
ed slowly, holding the carbine by 
the breecli, muzzle down, out 
from his side. 

A uniformed man came for- 
ward, holding a carbine leveled. 
There were tech sergeant’s stripes 
painted on the helmet that con- 
cealed his eyes. 

“WEat is this. Sergeant?” 
Zwicky said. 

“Hey!” another voice spoke up. 
“The guy’s an officer, for Chris- 
sakes!” 

TEe sergeant paused, looking 
uncertainly from Zwicky to Har- 
mon, who was looking back over 
his shoulder. The latter lowered 
his hands. 

“GI’s!” he blurted. “For God’s 
sake, Zwicky, tell them!” 

“Get ’em up — high!” the non- 
com snapped. “You, too, Cap’n.” 

“Masrbe you’d better tell me 
just what the hell you think you 
are doing,” Zwicky said, not mov- 
ing. 

“Maybe you’d better drop it, 
Cap’n, before I pull this trigger. 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



I’ve lost one man tonight, and 
I’m not messing around.” 

Z wicky let the gun fall. “All 
right, tell it, soldier.” 

“You better tell me what you 
are doing in my platoon area, 
Cap’n. And who’s this fellow?” 
He jerked his head at Harmon. 

“He’s a police officer. We’re 
looking for the man who drove 
the track up here.” Zwicky mo- 
tioned with liis head toward the 
big vehicle behind him. 

“Gus, take a look at their ID’s. 
Don’t get between me and them.” 
A corporal came forward, slung 
Eis carbine, grinned sheepishly as 
he patted Zwicky’s pockets, 
brought out his wallet, opened it 
and showed the blue card to the 
sergeant, who studied it by the 
light of the flash another man 
held. The corporal took Harmon’s 
badge, showed it to the other. 

“All right, I’ve played along 
with you. Sergeant,” Zwickey said 
as he pocketed his wallet “Now 
aim that piece in some other di- 
rection and tell me what the hell 
is going on here.” 

The sergeant lowered the car- 
bine reluctantly. “One o’ my 
men’s dead up there. Obers, worth 
any other three men in the out- 
fit. I’m looking for the man that 
did it” He glanced at the track. 
“Maybe — ” 

“Sure it’s Him!” Harmon burst 
out. “The man’s a cold-blooded 

161 



killer, an escaped convict!” He 
looked at Zwicky. “I told you 
about this boy, Captain. Now 
maybe you’ll listen to me!” 

“Let’s take a look,” Zwicky 
said. He picked up his carbine, 
wiped mud from it on his sleeve. 
Harmon scooped up his pistol. 

“Gus, you take the point,” tKe 
sergeant ordered the corporal. 
“Cap’n, you and the civilian next. 
I’ll be right behind.” 

It took the group a quarter of 
an hour to pick their way upslope 
to the spot where Ober’s body lay. 
Harmon whistled as he stared 
down at the mutilated corpse. 

“Okay,” he said. “Now you see 
what kind of guy we’re working 
with. Kid gloves, hah? Like Kell, 
Captain; like hell.” 

“There’s some kind of trail 
leading up here,” one of the men 
said. “Hey!” He pointed excitedly 
to a sheltered spot under a clump 
' of foliage. “Footprints — a couple 
of ’em!” 

“Sure, I seen tKe bastard,” tKe 
sergeant said. “I winged him, but 
he got clear. When I heard noises 
down below, I figured maybe he’d 
double back.” 

Harmon grunted. “He’s up 
there,” he said. “And I say let’s 
get him.” 

The sergeant looked at Har- 
mon. “You’re a cop,” he said. “If 
I go up there, I aim to sKoot first 
and chin witK the son of a bitch 
later.” 

162 



“Can’t say I blame you,” Har- 
mon said. 

“Gus, you take the detail,” the 
sergeant said. “I’ll be back when 
I’ve cleared my barrel into some- 
body’s gut.” 

With Zwicky in the lead, the 
three men started up the final 
ascent. 

Jt is dusk. Against the dust-red 
^ sky, the Hashes of the besieging 
cannon wink ceaselessly across 
the folds of the hills below the 
walls of the town. From the gates, 
a party of five men ride out on 
war horses, gaunt black steeds 
whose ribs stand out like the 
cheekbones of their helmeted and 
corseleted riders, one of whom 
carries a couched lance from the 
hip of which a white pennon flut- 
ters. Four of the men are olive- 
dark, blackbearded. One is 
smooth-shaven, with black-red 
hair and a scarred face. He sits a 
head taller in the saddle than any 
of his companions, and rides be- 
fore them. 

Another party of five men sit 
their horses on the brow of the 
slope. These men are better fed; 
one has black hair and a oafs 
eyes. One, with hair the color of 
new rust, sits in advance of the 
others, dressed in rich but well- 
worn war-gear, a sword at his 
side, a shield slung at his saddle- 
bow. 

The oncoming party halts fifty 

GALAXY 



ieet di&tant. The leader speaks 
briefly to his men, swings down 
from his mount, comes forward. 
The Tust-haired man dismounts, 
advances to meet him. They are 
of a height, one wider, thicker of 
wrist and neck, the other quicker- 
moving, lifter-footed. 

“J knew it was you,” the big- 
boned man says. “/ saw your 
cursed fowl coursing above the 
field.” 

“Yet you came.” 

“Have no fear. I honor the 
white ensign.” 

The flame-haired man laughs 
softly. 

“Many loyal men starve in the 
town,” the bigger man says. “This 
charade 'must end.” 

“Then cease your harrassment 
of my merchants.” 

“Let them peddle their wares at 
home! These people have no need 
of better steel and improved gun- 
powder. They do slaughter enough 
with their own crude means.” 

“I regret the uses to wluch 
knowledge is put. But that is the 
price of a growing technology.” 
“The price is too high! These 
barbarians are not ready.” 

“I’ve told you my terms, de la 
Torre — as I believe you style 
yourself these days.” 

“Because of those who trust 
me, I must yield. But we will 
meet again, brother” 

“No doubt, brother.” 

They turn, each rejoins his own 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



men. De la Torre’s chief lieuten- 
ant eyes the flame-haired man as 
he mounts his white horse. 

“My lord, why not kill Him 
now? A swift shaft in the back — ” 
His master catches him by the 
arm, lifts him to his toes. 

“He is mine, Castillo. Mine and 
no other’s!” 

Across the hill, the cat-eyed 
man rides close beside his lord. 

“Surely it would have been wise 
to dispatch the traitor on the 
spot,” he is saying. “A single prick 
of a poisoned dart — ” 

“No.” 

“But, lord! Doubtless he plots 
new betrayal.” 

“You lie, Pinquelle!” 

“I sometimes wonder, lord, 
whether truly it be hate — or love 
— that you feel for hum.” 

The master reins in, wheels to 
face his lackey. “Get thee gone 
from 'my company, Pinquelle! 1 
tire of thy pinched face and thy 
cruet eyes and thy poisonous 
tongue.” 

“As my lord wishes.” The man 
turns his mount and rides away, 
not looking back. 

XII 

C aptain Aldous Drake, Special 
Forces, on detached duty 
with HQ, Third Army, lay flat 
on his belly in sodden grass a 
hundred and thirty feet from the 
fire-blackened orifice that Had 

163 



beea the glass-and-aluminum 
itnain entrance to the power 
plant. A typist’s chair lay on its 
side among the rubble half block- 
ing the entry. A strip of tattered 
Scarlet carpet was draped over 
the Uttered porch and down the 
Steps, like the tongue of a dead 
animal. Smoke still drifted from 
the blackened interior of the en- 
try hall. 

“Pyter messed up the front 
'door pretty bad,” Staff Sergeant 
Ike Weintraub said, hugging the 
ground a few feet to Drake’s left 

“That’s okay. We don’t plan 
to waltz in their anyway. Ike, 
there’s your spot, off to the left, 
past the bushes.” Drake indicated 
a vertical ventilator slot cutting 
the featureless concrete front. “A 
few ounces of PMM ought to 
open a hole wide enough to sUde 
in through. Jess!” He addressed 
the big biack-faced three-striper 
on liis right. “Think you can get 
up on the roof — over there to 
the right, above the terrace?” 

“Sure, no sweat.” 

“When you get up there, keep 
low, look for the freight eleva- 
tor shaft. You know how to jim- 
my it.” Drake looked at his watch. 

“I make it five minutes and 
thirty seconds after.” He waited 
while the other two made minute 
adjustments to their timepieces. 
“Ike, I’m giving you five minutes 
to set your charges. Jess, you 
have your spot picked. Use your 

?64 



power jimmy, but no blasting. I 
may break a little glass getting 
in. We’ll spread out inside — you 
know the layout from the maps— 
and each go for his own target. 
First man to score sets off a 
screamer and we get the hell out. 
All right, let’s go.” 

“Cap’n. When we break away, 
will it be a category three, or 
what?” 

“Category one, Ike. Every man 
for himself. Our reports may make 
all the difference to the next 
team. But I’m betting both you 
bums a fifth of the good stuff we 
all make it clean. Let’s go.” Drake 
slid forward, using his elbows 
and toes in a quick, comical 
rhythm that ate up the distance 
with deceptive swiftness and in 
total silence. For a few seconds 
lie could see his two compatriots 
as dark blurs against darkness; 
then they were gone. 

Ahead the building waited, 
high, bright-lit, crossed by slant- 
ing lines of rain. Fifty feet from 
the facade, Drake encountered 
bits of debris: glass, brick frag- 
ments, a scrap of upholstery ma- 
terial, papers. He crossed a side- 
walk, another strip of grass, eased 
imder a line of low-growing jun- 
iper, and was against the face of 
the building. 

The windows — fixed double 
panels of heavy plastic — were 
just above him, the sills at face 
level, the room beliind them dark. 

GALAXY 



Drake came to his feet to the 
left of the opening, opened a 
pouch clipped to his pistol belt, 
took out a lump of a dark green 
material resembling modeling 
clay. He formed it swiftly into a 
long, slender tube, packed it along 
the edge of the glass, working 
two feet out from the corner 
along the bottom and side. He in- 
serted a tiny glass-encased cap- 
sule in the corner, attached a 
pair of hair-fine wires and with- 
drew along the face of the build- 
ing a distance of ten feet. He went 
flat, face down, and brought his 
wristwatcK up under his eyes. 
Three and a Half minutes elapsed. 
Ninety seconds to go. 

rain pounded Drake’s back. 

The cold mud under His 
cHest soaked througH his combat 
jacket, found chinks in his weath-

keep tKem limber. Never tell wfiat

Had talked as if tHe whole thing 
was an exercise, but the other 
bird — Pyler, his name was — 
Had been pretty shook up. Too 
bad He hadn’t Had a chance to 
talk to the men wHo’d come out 
of the plant, but Yount Had pass- 
ed on everything useful — or so 
He said. Not that It amounted to 
much. But for what it was worth, 
the pattern looked simple. The 
corridors were electrified, the 
switches, door hardware, every- 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



thing you’d normally touch. So 
the trick was to make your own 
holes, stick to the service ways, 
go straight for the spot the tech 
boys had shown him on the draw- 
ings, and zap! The job was done. 
After all, it was just a pile of ma- 
chinery in there. Pull the plug 
and it had to quit, it was as easy 
as that. 

Ten seconds to go. Drake hoped 
Ike was ready, and that Jess Had 
his spot picked. If there was some 
inside, some mad genius type. Hit- 
ting him in three places at once 
ought to keep him hopping. Five 
seconds. Too bad if he wasn’t 
quite close enough to the building 
and a pound or two of pulver- 
ized plexiglas hit him in the back. 

Drake thumbed the detonator 
button. There was an instantane- 
ous ear- shattering blast, and dirt 
gouted beside His face. He came 
to his feet, slid along the wall to 
the now glassless opening, reached 
in for a grip, jumped, pulled Eihl- 
self up over the sill and dropped 
onto a glass-littered carpet. He 
rolled to the wall, stopped with 
his feet spread, toes out, elbow 
braced, the pistol in his hand 
aimed toward the door. Dust was 
still settling. A piece of glass fell 
softly to the rug. A corpse lay 
face down near the desk. All right, 
Drake thought. Where’s Ike’s 
shot? 

He felt the dull blast through 
the floor before the sound came. 

165 



Drake let out a breatH and 
looked around the room. The en- 
try to the access system the en- 
gineers had pointed out was in 
the ceiling of the toilet opening on- 
to the office. The door was six feet 
away, standing ajar. Drake stood; 
as he did, he noticed a pale light 
glowing against the rug. A corri- 
dor light shining under the door, 
hitting the rug fibers? No, too 
bright for that. More of a fluores- 
cence — and getting brighter, rip- 
pling like the glow in hot embers. 
A spark leaped across the rug. 
Drake backed a step; His elbow 
touched a filing cabinet. 

In the next instant blue fire en- 
veloped him. He Had time to 
draw one breath — a breatR of 
flames that scorched His lungs — 
and to expell it in a ragged 
screech of agony. Then His char- 
red body fell stiffly, lay smoking 
on the floor, the half-slagged 
pistol still gripped in His black- 
ened finger bones. 

Qixty feet distant, in the ground 
floor mechanical equipment 
room, Ike Weintraub paused in 
wrapping a field bandage around 
the gash he Had received on his 
forearm from a wild fragment 
from his shot, his Head cocked. 
The sound Had been very faint, 
but it had sounded a lot like a 
yell — a scream, to be exact. But 
it was probably just wind whis- 
tling around some of the holes they 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



had knocked in the walls. He felf 
kind of embarrassed, being five 
seconds late on the blast. Drake 
was right on tHe button. Sharp 
character, old Drake. If all the 
brass were like Him, a man would 
not mind throwing a few salutes. 
Too bad the Army hadn’t beefl 
what He’d dreamed it would be: 
good men, trained fine, ready to 
face anything together, one for 
all and all for one, or whatever; 
the old saying was. Corny, may- 
be, but it was still the best thing 
in the world, to be with the ones 
you knew you could count on. 
Funny, back home he’d believed 
all that crap He’d been brought 
up on, about how much better 
he was than the goytm, had 
thought a black man was one 
notch above a gorilla. That was 
one thing about the Army. He’d 
foimd out that when the going 
got rough, it wasn’t the reU^bfl 
or the hide that counted, it was 
the stuff inside. Like Drake. 
Drake was the best. And old 
Jess. They didn’t make ’em any 
better. He’d go all the way to 
Hell with those two — like now. He 
didn’t like this job, not anything 
about it. Those civilians were no 
dumbells, and they were scared 
all the way through. And Pyler, 
too. He was a bastard, but no- 
body had even said he was yel- 
low. But it was okay being here, 
knowing what to do. How to do it, 
knowing Jess was in it with him, 

167 



that Drake was running the show. 
It was okay. And it was time to 
get moving. 

Weintraub flashed His needle- 
light around the big room, spot- 
ted the ladder against tKe wall 
behind the big sheet-metal duct, 
the trapdoor above it, right where 
they’d said. So far so good. All he 
Jiad to do now was skin up there 
and get into the crawl space, and 
head for the target. 

But still he hesitated. It looked 
too easy. It was what the double- 
'domes that worked in tKe place 
Had figured out — but they 
hadn’t done so hot when they’d 
been on the inside. Got their tails 
burned off. So maybe it might 
be a smart idea to take two looks 
at the layout before he jumped. 

Weintraub worked the light 
over the walls, ceiling, and floor. 
He got to his feet, moved along 
the wall, not touching it. The back 
of the big air-handlers looked 
about the same as the front. There 
was a wooden ladder clamped 
against the rear wall, in a narrow 
space behind a big condenser. A 
sqpare grill was set in the wall 
above it. There was nothing about 
St fUat looked any better than the 
Other route, but Weintraub liked 
St better somehov/. He lifted the 
ladder down, propped it against 
the wall, climbed it until he was 
facing the plastic grill. There were 
tvjo plastic knobs holding it. He 
loosened them, swung the grill 
16S 



aside and was looking into a 
dusty lift. Using his elbows, he 
pulled himself up and in. The 
light showed him a wide, low 
room, crammed full of ducting, 
conduits, cables, pipes. He didn’t 
like the look of all that gear, 
but there wasn’t much he could 
do about it. He knew which way 
to go. He started off, picking his 
way carefully over, under and 
through the obstructions. 

^T'en minutes later, following his 
mental image of the dia- 
grams he had studied for a full 
five minutes before starting out, 
he had reached the spot Drake 
had picked for him — he hoped. 

If he was on target, there would 
be a black pipe here as big as his 
leg. According to the civilians, it 
was some kind of tube conduit. 
When he blew it, it would shut 
down the high-pressure sliicone 
supply to the generator bearing, 
and in about three minutes they’d 
overheat and kick in a set of au- 
tomatic breakers. Anyway, that 
was the theory. It was plenty 
noisy here. That was a good sign. 
The manifold room was supposed 
to be right below him. And there 
was the pipe. He shone the light 
along the glazed black surface. 
The junction where it made a 
right-angle bend down looked like 
the spot to hit. Weintraub placed 
the Ught so as to sliine on the an- 
gle and extracted the shaped 

GALAXY 



charge from the poucH over his 
right hip. From another pocket 
he took the detonator, a tiny cap- 
sule half an inch long. He han- 
dled it with exaggerated care. The 
big charge would blow a hole 
through a concrete wall, but it 
stood a lot of handling. The cap, 
on the other hand, was as delicate 
as a cracked egg. One little slip, 
and blam! 

He cut off that line of thought. 
Keep your mind on business, that 
was the secret. A guy who broke 
down and ran was just a guy who 
thought too much about the 
wrong things. He’d either finish 
the job and get out alive, or he 
wouldn’t. If he didn’t, he’d never 
know what hit him. So why wor- 
ry? Smiling slightly, Ike Wein- 
traub shifted position to get at the 
miniature tools clipped to his 
belt. His head struck a pipe pass- 
ing low above him. 

It was not a hard blow, not 
really enough to daze him. But it 
was enough to jar the detonator 
cap from his fingers. It fell four- 
teen inches to the concrete floor 
and exploded with a force that 
shattered Weintraub’s lower jaw 
and drove a sizable section of jag- 
ged bone into his jugular vein. 

It was twenty-one seconds be- 
fore his heart, having pumped the 
body’s blood supply out through 
the immense wound, sucked con- 
vulsively on air, went into fibrilla- 
tion and stopped. 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



In the crav/1 space above the 
switch room, big Jess Dooley 
heard the sharp report. He frown- 
ed, waiting for the howl of the 
screamer that would mean Drake 
or Ike had scored. But nothing 
came. 

It figured. The bang hadn’t 
been loud enough to be a work- 
ing charge. Which left the qties- 
tion of what it had been. But that 
was a question that would have to 
wait. A category one operation, 
Drake had said. That meant get 
the job done and ask questions 
later, at the corner table in the 
bar where the three of them did 
their serious drinking. Funny 
world. Couldn’t get together in 
the NCO Club; Drake wasn’t 
allowed. Same for the Officers’ 
Club, no Em’s wanted. Same for 
most of the joints off-base. A 
black hide netted no smiles iii the 
Main Street spots, and he’d have 
to whip half the draft-dodgers in 
darktown if he took a couple of 
Pinks down there. Yep, funny 
world. It was better Here, with 
death crackling in the air all 
around him, doing the thing he 
knew how to do, with the men 
he knew he could count on to 
back his play, no matter wHat. 
Jess wiped sweat from his fore- 
head with a thick finger and, us- 
ing his pinpoint light, began stu- 
dying the maze of conduits 
sprouting from the big panel on 
the wall, looking for the two that 

’ 169 



carried the wires to tfie thermo- 
stats that controlled the fuel sup- 
ply to the nuclear generators bur- 
ied a hundred' feet below the sta- 
tion. 

T^alconer moved down from the 
^ boulder-strewn rim of the 
hollow, his eyes on the open, light- 
ed doorway, and on the slim 
shape soaring into darkness 
above. 

“I searched for you, Xix,” he 
said, in the old language that 
came haltingly to him. “I thought 
you’d lifted long ago, without 
me.” 

“I have never abandoned you, 
my commander,” the voice called 
over the drum of rain. “So long 
as the Other knew my location, I 
would never be safe from him in 
my weakened condition. It was 
necessary that I conceal myself. 
But nine hours ago the natives 
erected a crude energy field on 
v/hich I was able to draw for min- 
imal functions. At once I sent out 
my call to you, my commander. 
We must act swiftly now.” 

Falconer laughed softly. “After 
aU this time, Xix? What’s your 
hurry?” 

“Commander, the energy field 
is feeble, not matched to my re- 
ceptors. I draw but a trickle of 
power from it, insufficient to 
charge my static energy coil. If 
I am to lift from this planet I re- 
quir&more power. Much more.” 
170 



“How long will it take to draw 
enough from the broadcast field?” 
“Over a century. We cannot 
wait. We must charge the coil di- 
rectly from the source, unattenu- 
ated by distance.” 

“How?” 

“With your assistance, my com- 
mander. You must remove the lift 
coil, take it to the transmitting 
station and tap the beam direct- 
ly.” 

“It occurs to me that we’re very 
close to the transmitter. That 
must have been the installation I 
saw, on the way here. Rather a 
coincidence, eh, Xix?” 

“Indeed, commander. But the 
coil must be charged and time is 
short. Already I have been forced 
to. But no matter. You must 
remove the cod and descend at 
once to the transmitter.” 

“I heard firing down there. 
What’s going on, Xix?” 

“An effort was made to shut 
down the transmission. Of course 
I cannot permit that.” 

“How can you stop it?” 

“My commander, we must not 
delay now the discussion of pe- 
ripheral matters. I sense tliat I 
am threatened; the hour for ac- 
tion has come.” 

Falconer crossed the rock- 
strewn ground, aware of the thun- 
der and roll of the storm, beyond 
the protected area sealed off by 
the ship’s defensive field. He step- 
ped up through the entry port, 

GALAXY 



went along tlie dustless passage 
walled witK smooth synthetic, or- 
namented with fittings of im- 
perishable metal. In the control 
compartment, soft lights glowed 
across the banked dials and lev- 
ers, so once-familiar, so long for- 
gotten. 

“Xix. What about GralgratKor? 
If he’s still alive — ” 

“The traitor is dead.” 

“So many years,” Ke said. “I 
don’t feel any hate any longer,” 
He laughed, not a jolly laugh. 
“I don’t feel much of an 5 dhing 
now.” 

“Soon you will, my command- 
er. The long twilight ends. Ysar 
waits for us.” 

“Yes,” Falconer said. “Now I’d 
better get busy. It’s been a long 
time since I put a tool to a ma- 
chine of Ysar.” 

J ohn Zabisky, wounded in the 
lower right side by a steel- 
jacketed 30 calibre slug which 
had broken a rib, punctured a 
lung, traversed his liver and 
lodged in the inner curve of the 
ilium, lay on his face under a 
dense-needled dwarf pine. Im- 
mediately after he had been shot. 
He had covered fifty feet of rough 
going in his initial plunge away 
from danger. Then the shock 
Had overtaken him and dropped 
him on his face. For a while then 
— he had no idea how long — 
he had lain, dazed, feeling the Hot, 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



spreading ache in his side grow 
into a throbbing agony that swell- 
ed inside him like a ravenous an- 
imal feeding on his guts. Then 
the semi-euphoric state had given 
way to full consciousness. Zabis- 
ky explored with his fingers, 
found the entry sound. It was 
bleeding, but not excessively. The 
pain seemed to be somewhere 
else, deep inside. He was gut-shot. 

He knew what that meant. He 
Had an Hour, maybe two. A lousy 
way to go. He lay with his cheek 
against the mud and thought 
about it. 

Why the Kell had He followed 
the ^y. Falconer, after He’d kiss- 
ed Him pff? He had his money, 
two cees. Curiosity? Not exactly 
that, it was more than just stick- 
ing his nose in. It was like the 
guy needed Him. Like He was mix- 
ed up in something too tough for 
him, trying to do it alone, tack- 
ling too much for one man. And 
you wanted to Kelp the guy, stick 
by him. It was like there was 
something at stake, something 
you couldn’t put in words; but if 
you finked out, let it slide, wash- 
ed your hands of it, you’d never 
be able to see yourself again as 
the man you thought you were. 
It was like in the old days, kind 
of, when the first John Sobieski 
had climbed on his horse and led 
his men into battle. It was a thing 
you had to do, or admit you 
were nothing. 



171 



Yeah. And then the light had 
hit him in the face, and then some 
guy yells, and then the ballbat 
hit Kim in the side, and he heard 
tKe gun firing after him, and then 
he was here, and what good were 
the two cees now? 

And where the hell was here? 
Halfway up some lousy hill, in 
the woods, in the middle of the 
night, in a storm like you didn’t 
see twice in one lifetime. 

Especially not his lifetime. 
Maybe another hour. Maybe not 
that much. 

Falconer would help him, if he 
knew. 

Falconer was up ahead some- 
place. 

Got to get moving. 

Painfully, grunting, fighting 
back the nausea and the weak- 
ness, Zabisky pulled himself for- 
ward another foot. He had cover- 
ed perhaps a hundred yards when 
He saw the glow above. That 
would be Falconer up there. Prob- 
ably had a cabin up there, a 
warm room, a fire, a bed. Better 
to die in a bed than here. Better 
to die just trying for it than to 
stop here and let the pain wash 
up and up until it covered you 
and you sank down in it and were 
like all the other extinct animals 
you saw in books. Not much you 
could do then about anything. 
But it hadn’t come to that yet. 

Not n?uch you could do when 
you were in the pink. But you had 
172 



to make do with what you could. 
He still had a few yards left in Kim. 
Take ’em one at a time, that was 
the trick. One at a time ... as 
long as time held out. 

He had covered another Half 
dozen yards when Ke Heard the 
sound above: a faint clatter of 
dislodged pebble. 

“Falconer,” he called peering 
upward. There was a movement 
there, among tlie shadows. A long, 
high-shouldered, narrow shape 
flowed into view, stood looking 
down with yellow eyes that seem- 
ed to blaze like tiny fires against 
the blackness. 

tT'wo hundred yards to the east 
and a hundred feet below, 
Grayle worked his way along the 
face of a weathered fissure in the 
rock. Three times he had attempt- 
ed to gain the ledge above; three 
times he had fallen back. The dis- 
tance was too great, the scant 
handholds too slippery, the brok- 
en ribs still too crippling. Now Ke 
descended to the talus slope be- 
low, angling to the south, skirting 
the barrier. The grade was less 
precipitate here. Stunted trees had 
found footholds; brush and ex- 
posed roots offered grips for his 
hands. He made more rapid 
progress, moving laterally into 
bigger timber. Striking a faint 
path. He turned right along it, re- 
sumed his ascent. He had cover- 
ed only a few yards when he saw 

GALAXY 



the body lying at tfie base of tSe 
pine. 

For long seconds Ke stood star- 
ing down at tKe ripped throat of 
tKe dead man. Tfien Ke made an 
animal noise deep in fiis throat, 
sihook Himself like a man waking 
from a nightmare, and started 
upward. 

He Had covered a Hundred 
yards when Ke Heard sounds 
ahead: tlie grate of feet on stone, 
die puffing of labored breath. 
More than one man, making 
clumsy progress upward. 

He left the path and Hurried 
to overtake them. 

T ying flat on his back in utter 
darkness, Sergeant Jess Doo- 
ley felt the miniature power Hack- 
saw cut through the second of 
the two conduits. It Had been a 
delicate operation, cutting all tKe 
w;»y around each of the Half-incfi 
stainless steel tubes without 
touching the wires inside, but tKe 
engineers had made it pretty plain 
what would happen if a man 
shorted tliem accidentally. 

Now the trick was to sKort 
them on purpose and get away in 
one piece. Dooley wiped sweat on 
his forearm and thought about 
tlie layout Ke had studied on pa- 
per. Memory was important to a 
man in his line of work. You Had 
to Have a natural mnemonic ap- 
titude, and then survive some 
tough training to qualify as a 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



member of a Special Team. Af- 
ter all tKe trouble of getting to 
where the job was, tKere were 
plenty ofi times wEen completing 
it depended on perfect recall of a 
complicated diagram. 

Like now. It wouldn’t do to just 
cut a wire. There were six back- 
up systems tHat would take over 
in that case — even if He wasn’t 
fried in tHe process. He Had to 
tinker tfie tHing to give a false 
reading — and not too false at 
that. Just enou^ to sKow a no- 
demand condition, and make tKe 
automatic cut-outs lock in. These 
automated layouts were pretty 
smart: they could deal with just 
about any situation that came up. 
But you could fool ’em. They did 
not expect to get a pKoney signal 
from tKeir own guts. 

And if he could attach the little 
gadget the technical boys Had 
handed Kim at just tKe right spot, 
in just the right way — between 
sensors, and if possible at the 
same instant as a legitimate im- 
pulse from the tKermostats. 

Well, then, Ke might get away 
with it. 

He extracted the device — tKe 
size of a worm pill for a medium- 
sized dog — removed tlie protec- 
tive tubing from tKe contacts. He 
shifted position, settling Himself 
so Ke could make one smooth' co- 
ordinated motion. The protective 
devices wouldn’t like it if He 
fumbled the hookon, ipaking and 

173 



breaking contact half a dozen 
times in half a second before he 
got the ringer in position. 

He was ready. Sweat was rxm- 
ning down into His eyes. He wipOd 
at it ineffectively witK fiis shoul- 
der. Hot in Here, no air. A man 
could suffocate before He got tKe 
job done. So wHat was He waiting 
for? Nothing. He was ready. The 
next time the relay clicked — it 
cycled about once every five min- 
utes — He’d make his move. 

^aptain Zwicky, a few feet in 
^ advance of Sergeant PitcKer 
and Harmon, pulled Himself up 
over an outcropping of granite 
and started to rise to His feet. 

“TKat’s far enough. Captain,” 
a deep voice said from above. 
“TKis is no place for you tonight. 
Go back.” 

Zwicky remained frozen, both 
Hands and one knee on tHe 
ground, an expression of total 
astonishment on his upturned 
face. Behind Him, PitcHer, hear- 
ing the sudden voice. Halted, then 
eased forward. Over the captain’s 
shoulder he could see dark under- 
brush dripping foliage — and the 
legs and torso of a man. A big 
man, in dark clothes. 

In a single motion. He raised 
tKe carbine, sighted and fired. At 
the explosion beside his right ear, 
Zwicky plunged forward and 
sideways. Pitcher, his path clear- 
ed, scrambled up, saw the tall, 
174 



dark-shadowed figure still stand- 
ing in the same position; hastily 
He brought tKe carbine up — and 
felt a ringing sKock against his 
Hands as tfie gun flew from his 
grip. He made a lunge in the di- 
rection the weapon had skidded, 
felt hard Hands catcH him, lift 
Him, turn Him. Zwicky was on his 
feet, raising his carbine; but he 
was having trouble finding a clear 
sKot. PitcKer felt himself swung 
forw*ard, released. He crashed 
downward through twenty feet 
of brush before he came up hard 
against a tree. As He struggled up. 
Lieutenant Harmon grabbed his 
arm, dragged Him to his feet. 

“What Happened up there? 
That shot — ” 

“Leggo,” Pitcher blurted. He 
chopped at Harmon’s Hand, grab- 
bed for the other’s pistol. “Gimme 
tfiat!” 

“You nuts?” 

The arrival of Captain Zwicky, 
sliding and tumbling down the 
trail, cut off His protest. Pitcher 
stepped back. Holding the pistol, 
as Zwicky came to rest on his 
back between the two men. 

“Stand fast, Sergeant!” he 
blurted as Pitcher started past 
Him. 

“I’m getting the bastard that 
killed Obers,” Pitcher snarled. 

“That’s an order!” Pitcher Halt- 
ed as Zwicky crawled to his feet. 
His nose was bleeding and He 
had lost his cap. He wiped at his 

GALAXY 



face with the back of his hand, 
smearing blood which ran down, 
mingling with rainwater. 

“Losing more men won’t Kelp 
anything,” he said. “I don’t know 
what we’re up against, but it’s 
more than it looks like. Before we 
try it again, we have to — ” 

At that moment, a sound cut 
through the crash of the storm: 
a strident, wailing scream that 
ran down the scale and died in a 
groan of horror. 

Without a word, Harmon whirl- 
ed and plunged down the path. 
Pitcher backed two steps, was 
jabbed between the shoulder 
blades by the stub of a dead 
branch. He dropped his carbine, 
dived down the slope head-first. 
Zwicky hesitated for a moment, 
started to shout a command, then 
■turned and went down the path, 
not running, but wasting no time. 

CCTl^hat in the Nine Hells was 
’ ’ tliat?” Falconer rose from 
the open panel behind which the 
compact bulk of the drained en- 
ergy coU was mounted. 

“Don’t be alarmed,”’ the cool 
voice of the ship said. “It is mere- 
ly a warning device. I arranged 
to keep the native life in all its 
forms at a distance.” 

“It sounded like a hunting 
kriU. By tlie king of all devils, 
I’d forgotten that smmd.” 

“It serves its purpose most ef- 
fectively.” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



“What set it off just now?” 
"A native was prowling near- 
by.” 

“A strange time and place to be 
prowling.” 

“Have no fear. Now that my 
Y field is restored, I am safe 
from their petty mischief.” 

“I may have led them here,” 
Falconer said. “It’s too bad. 
There’s likely to be trouble when 
I start back down.” 

“There are weapons in my 
armory. Commander — ” 

“I have no desire to murder 
anyone, Xix,” Falconer said. 
“These are people too. This is 
their world.” 

“Commander, you are as far 
above these natives as — but I 
distract you from your task. 
Their presence nearby indicates 
the need for haste.” 

In silence. Falconer resumed 
the disassembly of the lift unit. 

For a moment after the cry of 
the hxmting krill sounded, Grayle 
stood staring upward into the 
darkness of the rim beyond which 
faint light gleamed on the slant- 
ing curtain of rain. There was no 
further sound. He resumed his 
climb, crossed a slope of naked 
rock, made his way up over a 
jumble of granite and was look- 
ing across a pebble-strewn ledge 
at the soft glowing Ul-metal hull 
of a fleet boat of the Ysarian Na- 
vy upreared among the rock 
slabs. 



175 



J ess Dooley Heard the soft click 
of tEe relay as it opened. 
He Had precisely point four sec- 
onds to move. In a smooth mo- 
tion He toucEed tEe two wires 
of the false-signal device to tEe 
exposed conductors. 

A spark jumped to tEe exposed 
end of the cut-tErougE conduit, 
from wEicH a volatile anti-static 
and coolant fluid was draining. 
THe flasE of fire seared tEe Hair 
from tEe left side of Dooley’s 
scalp, cEarred tEe edge of His ear, 
scorched deep into tEe exposed 
skin of Eis neck. In an instant re- 
flex, tEe man snatcEed a tiny- 
EigH-pressure can from Eis belt, 
directed a billow of smotHering 
foam at Eimself, at the pool of 
fluid over whicS pale blue flames 
leaped like burning brandy on a 
fruitcake, over tEe conduits and 
cables around him. He moved 
backward, awkward under tEe low 
ceiling, Holding Eis breatH to ex- 
clude the mixture of flame, foam 
End noxious gases. 

THe flames winked and dim- 
med. THen the pain Hit. Dooley 
dropped the can, groped for an- 
other, gave Eimself a liberal dose 
of nerve paralsrsant. THe burned 
side of Eis face went wooden. 
Too late, He turned Eis Head. A 
drop of condensed painkiller 
trickled into the corner of Eis 
right eye. THere was a momenta- 
ry stinging; tHen numbness, dark- 
ness.

Swearing to himself, Dooley 
found His needle-ligKt, switched 
it on. NotEing. THe light was Eot 
against liis Hand. It was working, 
all right. But He couldn’t see it. 
WitE nerve-deadener in botH eyes, 
Ee was bhnd as a bat. 

Nice work, Dooley. Nice spot, 
Is the fire out? Hope so. Is tEe 
little magic combination can- 
opener and disaster-averter in 
place and functioning? Hope tKat 
too. MeanwEUe, how does! a man 
go about getting tEe EeU out of 
Here? 

Alone, in darkness, Dooley be- 
gan incEing Eis way back along 
tEe route he Had come. 

Tn the glow of the campHre, the 
-®- faces of the men are ruddy, 
belying the privations of the long 
campaign. They sit in silence, lis- 
tening to the shrill cicadas, the 
soit sounds of the river, looking 
across at the scattered lights oi 
Vicksburg. 

An orderly approaches, a boy 
scarcely out oi his teens, thin and 
awkward in his dusty blue urd- 
iorm. He halts beiore a broad- 
shouldered oHicet with shoulder- 
length hair, once red, now shot 
with gray. 

“General Hogan, Major Tate’s 
compliments, sir, and they took 
a rebel colonel hali an hour ago 
scouting this side the river, and 
would the general like to talk to 
him.” 



GALAXY 



The big man rises. “All right, 
lad.” He follows the boy along 
the crooked path among the 
pitched tents where men in rum- 
pled blue sit listessly, oppressed 
by the humid heat and the 
swarming insects. At a rough 
compound built of boards 
wrenched from the walls of a 
nearby barn, a slouching sentry 
straightens as they approach, pre- 
sents arms. A captain emerges 
from a tent, salutes, speaks to 
an armed sergeant. A detail of 
four men fall in beside them. The 
gate is opened. 

“A five-man escort?” General 
Logan says mildly as they enter 
the compound. “He must be a re- 
doubtable warrior indeed.” 

The captain has a round red 
face, a long, straggly mustache. 
He wipes sweat from his face, 
nods. 

“A hard case. Cripps swears he 
broke a half -inch rope they had 
on him. I guess if he hadn’t been 
oat cold when they found him, 
they wouldn’t have got the rope 
on 1dm in the first place. I’m tak- 
ing no chances with him.” 

They halt before a blacksmith’s 
forge, where a bare-headed man 
waits, trussed with new hemp 
rope. He is big, broad, with a 
square, scarred face and black- 
red hair. There are iron man- 
acles on his wrists. An iron can- 
nonball lies by, in p>osition to be 
attached to his left ankle. There 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



is blood on his face and on his 
gray tunic. 

General Logan stares at the 
man. “You,” he says in a tone 
of profound astonishment. The 
prisoner blinks through the dried 
blood which has run down into 
his eyes. Abruptly, he makes a 
shrugging motion, and the men 
holding him are thrown back. He 
tenses, and with a sharp popping 
sound, the hemp strands break. 
He reaches, seizes the black- 
strath’s hammer in his manacled 
hands, leaps forward, and brings 
the heavy sledge down with 
smashing force on the skull of the 
Union general.

parrying tfie Heavy coil, Falcon- 
^ er stood for a moment in 
the entry, looking out across th’e 
circle of dry dust and loose stone 
soft-lit by tKe ship’s port lights, 
ending in abrupt transition to the 
rim of broken, rain-swept rock, 
and beyond, the tops of black 
trees rising from below. 

“Good luck, commander,” Xix 
said as fie stepped down. Burden- 
ed by tfie Heavy load, fie picked 
his way across toward tfie point 
below wfiicH tfie path led down- 
ward. He Had descended less tfian 
a Hundred feet wfien fie saw the 
man lying face-down in the path’, 
bulky in a bright-colored mackin- 
aw. Falconer dropped the coil, 

177 



knelt by the man’s side. There 
was blood on the side of the 
Heavy coat. He turned tHe man 
over, saw tHe gaping wounds 
across the side of tHe thick mus- 
cular neck, the sKredded front 
of the sodden jacket. 

“John Zabisky,” He muttered. 
“Why did you follow me?” 

Zabisky’s eyelids stirred, lifted; 
his small, opal-black eyes looked 
into Falconer’s. His lips moved. 

“I . tried,” he said distinct- 
ly; then all the light went out of 
hsi eyes, left them as dull as 
stones. 

Falconer rose, stood looking 
down at the rain falling on the 
face of the dead man. He glanced 
up at a faint sound and a hard 
white light struck Kim in the 
eyes. 

“I should have known you 
wouldn’t die,” a deep Karsh voice 
said out of the darkness. 

4 6 Co you’re alive, Gralgrathor,” 

^Falconer said. 

Grayle came forward, looked at 
the body on the ground at Fal- 
coner’s feet. “I see you’ve had a 
busy night, Lukrien.” 

“And more business yet to 
come. I don’t have time to waste, 
’Thor. Go your way and I’ll go 
mine. Or you still intent on brain- 
ing me?” 

“I didn’t come here to kill you, 
Lukrien, my business is with 
tHat.” He tilted Kis head toward 
178 



the faint glow from above. 

“You expect Xix to take you off 
this world?” 

“On the contrary. Xix isn’t go- 
ing anywhere.” 

“I think he is. Stand aside, 
’Thor.” 

“I didn’t come to kill you, Lo- 
ki,” Grayle said. “But I will if 
you try to interfere.” He pointed 
down the path. “You’ll be safe 
down there.” 

“We’ll go down togetKer.” 

“You’re going down. I’m going 
up,” Grayle said. 

Falconer shook his head. “No,” 
Ke said. 

Grayle looked across at Him', 
his square face obscure in the 
darkness. “When tKe Y-field went 
on and I felt the homing pulse, 
I knew you’d come, if you lived. 
I hoped to get here aKead of 
you. It’s strange, but over the 
years the thought Had grown in 
my mind that somehow, in some 
way, there’d been some fantastic 
mistake. Then I saw the dead 
man down below. I knew then I’d 
find you Here.” 

“I find that remark obscure, 
’TKor.” 

“Have you forgotten I’ve seen 
wounds like those before?” 

“Indeed? Where, might I ask?” 

“You dare to ask me tHat.” 

Soft footfalls sounded, coming 
closer. From the shadows beside 
the path, a sinuous shape 
emerged, pacing on padded feet. 

GALAXY 



It resembled, more tHan any otEer 
terrestrial creature, a giant black 
panther: as big as a Bengal tiger; 
but longer-legged, slimmer, deep- 
er cKested, witifi a rounded skull 
and bright, alert yellow eyes. It 
advanced on Grayle, raised a 
claw-studded paw as big as a 
dinner plate. 

“Stop!” Falconer shouted, and 
leaped between the man and the 
beast. The ktill halted, lashed its 
tail, seated itself on its haunches. 

“Do not be alarmed, Lukrien,” 
it said in the smooth, carefully 
modulated voice of Xix. “I am 
here to help you.” 

fiCTT^hat are you?” Falconer 
’ ' said. “Where do you come 
from?” 

“My appearance must surprise 
you. Commander,” the cat-thing 
said. “But I am a construct, 
nothing more.” 

“An Ysarian construct. How?” 

“Xix created me. I am his eyes 
and ears at a distance. You may 
address Him through me.” The 
krill rose, paced a step toward 
Grayle. 

“Leave him alone,” Falconer 
said. 

The krilt stared at Falconer. 
“My commander, the traitor 
must die.” 

“I need his help to force an 
entry into the plant.” 

“Nonsense.” 

“That’s an order, Xix!” Fal- 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



coner faced Grayle. “Drop the 
grenade belt. Pick up the coil.” 
He indicated the latter lying 
where he had left it. 

“This thing belongs to you, di, 
Loki?” Grayle eyed the kiill. “I 
wondered why you chose the par- 
ticular method you did. But now 
that I’ve seen your weapon I un- 
derstand.” 

“Commander — let me kill the 
traitor!” the krill hissed. 

Falconer looked into the yellow 
eyes. 

“Are you the only construct 
Xix made?” 

“There were others, comman- 
der.” 

“Not in the shape of animals.” 

“True.” 

“A man named Pinquelle . 
and Riuies . and a soldier called 
Sleet. ” 

“I have had many names, com- 
mander.” 

“Why? Why didn’t you an- 
nounce yourself?” 

“It seemed wiser to be discreet. 
As for my purpose — why, it was 
to assist you in the nurture of 
the technology we needed to do 
that which we must do.” 

“The placement of the povvrer 
plant is no coincidence, then.” 

“I was instrumental in select- 
ing the site, yes.” 

“You’re full of surprises, aren’t 
you, Xix? I wonder what you’ll 
come up with next.” 

“I am true to my purpose, 

179 



Commander, nothing more.” 

Falconer turned abruptly to 
Grayle. 

“We’re going down tlie moun- 
tain, ’Tli'or. We’re going to re- 
charge tKe power coil and return 
here. Then Xix is going to lift for 
Ysar. Help me, and I’ll take you 
with me. Refuse and Xix will 
deal with' you.” 

Grayle growled and took a step 
toward Him, The krill tensed its 
long legs, its Head up, eyes brigfit 
on Grayle’s tliroat. Falconer 
stared into Grayle’s face. 

“Why, ’TKor?” He said softly. 
“Why are you intent on destroy- 
ing U3 all?’” 

“I swore to kill you, LokL I 
intend to fulfill tiJat promise.” 

Tim krill yowled and yearned 
tovrard Grayle: Falconer restrain- 
ed it witH a word. “You can com- 
mit suicide,” fie said. “WKereas 
if you stay alive and cooperate, 
a better opportunity may present 
itself.” 

For a moment, Grayle Hesitat- 
ed. Then fie stepped back, picked 
up the coil, slung it by its straps 
over his sKoulder. 

“Yes,” he said. “PerKaps it 
will.” 

^olonel Ajax Pyler stood beside 
^ his staff car, looking toward 
the point from*wffidi the firing 
had come. 

“Well, Cal? Wfiat tlie devil is 
going on over there!” 

18 ® 



The aide was speaking urgent- 
ly into a field phone. “Bring him 
up the road. I’ll talk to Kim my- 
self.” He switched off. “A B Com- 
pany man. Colonel. Something 
spooked Kim. He swears he saw 
two men cross the plant grounds 
and enter the building. He opened 
up on them. ...” 

“And?” 

“It’s a wild tale . here they 
come now.” 

A jeep was approaching from 
the direction of the perimeter 
fence. It pulled in beside the staff 
car; a sergeant and a private 
jumped down, stood at attention. 
The sergeant saluted. 

“Sir, this is the private — ” 

“I can see that. Get on with 
it. Just what did you see?” 
“Colonel, I seen these here two 
fellers, they come out o’ the woods 
up above where I was at, first 
thing I knew he had my gun out 
of my hands — ” 

“Were you asleep?” 

“Not me. Colonel! Too damn 
cold. These fellers come up quiet, 
and with the wind and all, and 
I was watching towards the plant, 
never figured nobody — ” 

“So they jumped you and took 
your gun. Then what?” 

‘Well — I guess I yelled, and 
one of ’em told me to be quiet. 
Real nice spoken, he was. Big 
feller. BotiS of ’em. And — ” 
‘What happened, man? Which 
way did they go?” 



GALAXY 



“Why, like I told sergeant here, 
they up and went right down 
through the wire.” 

“What did they cut it with?” 
“Hell, Colonel, they didn’t cut 
nothing. Tore that wire up with 
their bare hands. One of ’em did. 
Other feller wag loaded down.” 
“Sergeant, why didn’t the 
alarms go off? I ordered triple 
circuitry all the way around the 
perimeter!” 

“Colonel, I don’t know ■— ” 
“How could anyone get inside 
unobserved? The entrance is 

flood-lit — ” 

“That’s lust if. Colonel! They 
never used the front door — nor 
the holes them Special Forces 
boys blew, ijust walked right 
through the wall! And after that 
come this critter. Bfe black as a 
caved-in coal mine, and eyes like 
fire. It come right up to me and 
looked at me like Hell’s door left 
open, and went on down and 
through the wire. That was when 
I let fly. Colonel.” 

“That’s enough!” Pyler jerk- 
ed His head at the sergeant. “Take 
this man back to the dispensary. 
I don’t know what he’s been 
drinking, or where he got it, but 
he’s raving like a lunatic.” 

He turned to his aide. “Cal, get 
a squad of master marksmen to- 
gether, post them covering the 
exit. If there’s anyone in there, 
we’ll be ready when he comes 
out!” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



L ieutenant Harmon pushed 
through the clump of men 
examining the tangled barbed 
wire through which a swathe had 
been untidily cut. 

“ s s . look at these ends,” a 
man was saying. “That wasn’t 
sheared; it failed in tension. Look 
at the deformation. It’s been 
stretched.” 

“Hey — Here’s why the scream- 
ers didn’t go off.” Another man 
showed a strand of insulated wire. 
“They jumped it.” 

“Who saw what Happened?” 
Harmon barked the question. 
Faces turned his way. He got a 
brief second- and third-Hand ac- 
count of the progress of the two 
intruders through the wire, across 
the grotmds, and into the rear of 
the building. 

“They didn’t mess with tSe 
doors,” a bulky corporal granted. 
“They made their own Hole.” 
“Vl^afs that supposed to 
mean?” 

“Put the light on if, SHom,” 
the corporal said. A dazzling 
searchlight sprang to brilliance, 
thrust a smoky finger acrc^ the 
hundred yards of rain-soaked 
turf to glare on the buff-colored 
masonry wall marred by a ragged 
black aperture at ground level. 

“I didn’t hear any explosion,” 
Harmon said, 

“Wasn’t none.” The corporal 
spat. “They busted that Hole bare- 
handed.” 



18 ! 



“Ek»n.’t kid me,” Harmon snarl- 
ed. 

“Hey, ain’t you tKat out-of- 
state cop?” a freckle -faced soldier 
witK a pale, pinched face spoke 
up. “I heard the man you were 
after tore the door off a car, 
something like that. Maybe it’s 
the same guy.” 

Harmon glowered at the laugh- 
ter. “Where’d they take this kid 
that saw all this?”' 

“Field dispensary. Down the 
road.” 

Harmon walked back to the 
jeep Zwicky had lent him, turned 
it, drove back up past the parked 
vehicles of the convoy. It took 
him fifteen minutes to find the 
white mobile hospital, parked in a 
field under trees. Inside, he asked 
for and was led to Tatum’s bed- 
side. 

“Hell, I ain’t sick,” the private 
said indignantly. 

“Take it easy, fellow,” Har- 
mon said. “Now tell me what this 
man you saw looked Uke. ...” 

I ying in darkness with his face 
against the cool floor, Jess 
Dooley drew deep, regular breaths, 
forcdog himself back to calm. 
Panic wasn’t going to help. Panic 
kills, tliat was what the posters 
on the cool, green walls back at 
headquarters said. He wasn’t real- 
ly trapped in a maze with’ no way 
out, trapped in the dark, buried 
alive — 

182 



Nothing like that. He was lost, 
sure. A man could get lost easy 
enough in a mess of crawlways, 
even if he had studied the plans 
for a whole five minutes. But 
what was lost could be foimd. 

All he had to do was keep his 
head, feel his way, and after a 
while he’d hear them coming to 
look for him. He’d been scraping 
his chin and bumping his head 
and eating dust and taking the 
long tour of the« crawl way system 
for half an hour now. Been do- 
ing all riglit, too, up until tlie 
panic hit him. Claustrophobia, 
that’s what they called it. Never 
bothered him before. But thhty 
minutes of being blind was 
enough for the first time out. Now 
he wanted air, wanted light, 
wanted to raise his head, stand 
up, instead of being rushed 
in here in this space just high 
enough to push tlirough’, with all 
those tons of rocks above — 

Take it easy, Dooley. No panic, 
remember. Maybe one of the oth- 
er guys had gotten in first, and 
forgotten to fire his screamer, 
and maybe it was all just spinned 
wheels. 

And maybe He’d better stop 
lying here and get moving. Jess 
snorted dust from his nose, and 
moved forward. His outstretched 
hand touched a rounded plastic- 
walled duct. He remembered tlie 
duct system : it would lead a man 
out of this maze. And there were 

GALAXY 



access panels spotted along it. ... 

Three minutes later, Dooley 
was inside the big duct, beaded in 
a direction Ke Hoped was up- 
stream. He covered fifty feet, 
rounded a turn — and heard 
faint sounds from up ahead — or 
was it off to tfie side? Voices. 
Good old Drake, knew he’d come, 
Him and Ike. Close now. Yell, 
and let them know? Hell witH it. 
Came this far, play it cool. Could 
see a faint ligKt up aHead, 
tfirough a grill. Dope was wearing 
off. Just make it up there, and 
flap a Hanky, and in another min- 
ute or two they’d be outside, 
having a good laugK together, 
breathing that cold, fresh air. 
Smiling, Jess Dooley moved for- 
waixi along the duct above the 
Energy Staging Room. 

The exKaust grill was a louvered 
panel two feet by three, designed 
to be serviced from the inside. 
Jess found the release clips, lifted 
the grid aside. The voices were 
cleared now, not more than twen- 
ty, thirty feet away. 

Jess frowned, listening. That 
wasn’t Drake’s voice, or Ike’s 
They weren’t even speaking Eng- 
li^. Frowning, Jess lay in the 
darkness and listened. 

it put it down here.” Falconer 
ordered. Grayle lowered 
the drained power coil to the floor, 
while the krill watched closely. 

Falconer knelt beside the pack, 
184 



unstrapped it, exposing the com- 
pact device witHin. 

“Get tKe cover off the service 
Hatch,” Ke ordered. 

Followed by tKe cat-tfiing, 
Grayle crossed to tKe KatcH, forced 
a finger imder tKe edge of the steel 
plate, ripped it away as if it were 
wet cardboard. 

“Stand aside.” Falconer lifted 
the discharged coil. Grayle hadn’t 
moved. 

“Don’t try it yet,” Falconer 
said. “The odds are still too 
great.” 

“Loki, don’t charge that coil,” 
Grayle said. “Defy your master. 
Without your help it’s powerless.” 

“My master — ?” 

The krill moved swiftly for- 
ward, raised a hook-studded fore- 
arm. 

“Stand fast, Xix,” Falconer 
snapped. The creature paused, 
turned its great eyes on him. “He 
threatens our existence. Comman- 
der!” 

“I’ll decide that.” 

“But will you?” Grayle said. 
“Don’t you really know yet, 
Loki?” 

The krill yowled and struck at 
Grayle, ripping the leather arm 
of his jacket as he jumped back. 
It followed, ignoring Falconer’s 
shout. 

“See how your faltliful slave 
comes to heel, Loki!” Grayle 
called. 

Falconer took two swift steps 
GALAXY 



to tHe open HatcK, poised tKe 
coil on the rim, caught up the 
two heavy jack-tipped cables. 

“Stop, Xix, or I’ll cross-connect 
the coil and melt it down to slag!” 

The ktill whirled on Falconer, 
jaws gaping, the serrated bony 
ridges that served as teeth bared 
in a snarl. 

“Would you aid the treacHer in 
his crimes?” 

“I’ll listen to what he has to 
say,” Falconer said. 

“Commander! Remember, only 
I can take you back to Ysar!” 

“Talk, ’Thor,” Falconer said. 
“What are you hinting at?” 

^"T^welve feet to the right and 
eight feet above the spot 
where Grayle stood with his back 
to the wall, Jess Dooley lay, his 
blind eyes staring into inky black- 
ness, his ears straining to make 
sense of the jabber of alien voices 
rising through the open ventila- 
tion grill beside him. 

There were three of them: one 
deep, rough-edged, one a reson- 
ant baritone, one an emotionless 
tenor. He didn’t like that last one; 
it sounded the way a corpse would 
sound if it could sit up and 
talk. And the other two sounded 
mad clear through. Jess couldn’t 
understand the words, but he 
knew the tone. Somebody was 
fixing to kill somebody down 
there. There wasn’t any way he 
could stop it, even if the victim 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



didn’t have it coming. Because 
this was them, sure enough: the 
ones who’d messed things up Here, 
sabotaged the place, killed all 
those people. Russians, probably. 
Too bad he didn’t know Russian. 
Probably be getting an earful 
now. 

He was lucky he’d heard them 
when he did. Another second, and 
he’d have dropped right down 
amongst ’em. And from what he 
had heard about Commie spies, 
that would be the end of the Doo- 
ley biography. 

No, there was nothing to do. 
Just lie quiet, and wait for what 
came next — and be ready to 
move fast, if it worked out that 
way. 

T ying on the hard cot in the 
tiny metal-walled room, Anne 
Rogers wondered where she was. 
She remembered wind, rain, 
bright lights shining across wet 
tarmac — 

They had taken a helicopter. 
She and . and a man. 

It was gone again. A crazy 
dream. About running, and police 
cars, shots, breaking glass — 

The copter, hurtling low above 
whipping treetops, the sudden jar- 
ring impact, and — 

She had been hurt. Maybe the 
copter ride was a dream, but she 
had been hurt. She was sure of 
that. Her hands went to her face, 
explored her skull, checked her 

185 



arms, ribs. She sat up, and was 
surprised at the dizziness that 
swept over Her. Her legs seemed 
to be intact; there were no heavy 
bandages swathing Her an 5 uvhere. 
Her head ached, and there were 
lesser aches here and there, but 
nothing serious. Her eyes ^went 
once again around the small 
room. A hospital, of course. Some 
sort of temporary one, like the 
kind the police took to the scene 
of an accident. 

The police. 

She remembered all about the 
police now. He — the man — 
strange, ^e couldn’t remember his 
face clearly, or his name — had 
attacked a policeman. Or two of 
them. And now where was he? 
Anne felt a sudden pang of fear. 
Was he dead? For some reason, 
the idea filled her with panic. She 
swung her legs over the side of 
the bed. She was still fully dress- 
ed, even to the muddy trench- 
coat. Whoever had brought her 
here Hadn’t taken much trouble 
with her. But why should they? 
As far as they were concerned, 
she was just a gun-moll, an ac- 
complice of an escaped convict. 

Rain drmnmed and beat on the 
roof, only inches above her head. 
She rose and went, a little un- 
steadily, across to the narrow 
door. A passage less than three 
feet wide led past identical doors 
to a square of dim light at the 
end. She went to it, looked 
186 



through a window into a room 
where a man stood, talking into a 
canvas-cased telephone. 

“He’s inside the power plant, 
Captain, but I can’t get any co- 
operation out of the Army. I’ve 
been ordered to stay the Kell and 
gone back from the fence, not go 
near tlie place. But this boy is 
my meat. Brasher, all six-three of 
him! I’ve got bones to pick with 
this con, and it’U be his bones!” 
There was a pause while he lis- 
tened, his face set in a scowl. 

“Don’t worry. I know how to 
handle it. , . Sure, 111 stay back. 
I’ve got the spot all picked. I can 
cover the front and the hole he 
blasted in the side, both. Which- 
ever way he comes. I’ll be there 
— just for insurance. I’ll be 
watching him through the sights. 
One wrong move, and — Sure, 
I’ll watch it. Don’t sweat me. 
Captain. Just so I’ve got your 
backing. Right.” He Hung up, 
stood smiling a crooked smile at 
the wall. 

“But I’ve got a funny feeling,” 
he said softly, aloud, “that any 
move that son of a bitch makes 
will be the wrong one — for him!” 

A nne moved quickly away from 
the door, hurried to the op- 
posite end of the passage, stepped 
out into driving wind and slash- 
ing rain. It was dark here, but 
a himdred feet away were tlie 
lights of the vehicels on the road, 

GALAXY 



and beyond was the looming pile 
of the power plant, bleak as a 
mortuary in the glare of the flood- 
lights. 

Grayle was in tEere. And when 
he came out, they’d be waiting 
for him. She Had to warn him. 

Ten minutes later, Having 
crossed the road bdow the convoy 
and approached the power plant 
beyond the glare of the field- 
lights, Anne studied the front of 
the building from the shelter of 
a clump of alder. The doors Had 
been blown away, the entry was 
wide open. There was nobody 
near it. If slie ran, without stop- 
ping to think, quickly, now — 

She had covered Half of the 
hundred yards of open lawn be- 
fore a shout sounded. 

“It’s a woman!” another voice^ 
yelled. 

“Shoot, damn you!” a third 
voice commanded. 

There was the flat, echoing 
carrong! of a Heavy rifle, and 
mud leaped in a gout beside Her. 
She ran on, heard the second shot, 
felt the sting of mud that spat- 
tered her legs. Then she was 
among the rubble, leaping an 
overturned chair, scrambling be- 
tween broken door frames as a 
third bullet chipped stone above 
Her head and screamed away in- 
to the darkness. 

“Grayle,” Anne whispered, 
looking along the dark corridor. 
“Where are you?” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



Five minutes later, she came on 
wet, muddy footprints in the pas- 
sage. She followed them, moving 
quickly along the silent passage, 
to a stairwell leading down. 

44T~\o you know what my mis- 
sion here on Earth was, 
Loki?” Grayle asked. 

“To conduct a routine recon- 
naissance.” 

“One of Xix’s lies. My orders 
were to establish a class O bea- 
con.” 

“Class O. That refers to a ma- 
jor navigational aid with a pow- 
er output in the lower stellar 
range.” 

“Commonly known as a Hell- 
core.” 

“A Hellcore device — on an in- 
habited world?” Falconer shook 
His head. “You must be mistaken. 
Battle Command has no author- 
ity to order such a measure.” 

“The order didn’t come from 
Battle Command. It came from 
Praze — my ship.” 

“Go on.” 

“I refused to comply, ordererd 
tlie mission aborted. Praze re- 
fused, overrode my commands.” 

“I wondered about the crash. 
An Ysarian ship doesn’t malfunc- 
tion. You scuttled her, didn’t 
you?”’ 

“Ship-killer!” the krill hissed. 

“I scuttled her — but not be- 
fore she got the Hellcore away. 
It impacted in the sea, off the 

187 



coast of the continent now known 
as North America.” 

“Why didn’t you refer the order 
to Battle Command for confir- 
mation?” 

“Battle Command is a ma- 
chine. It would have confirmed 
it.” 

“You’re raving, ’Thor! Battle 
Command is made up of veteran 
combat officers: High General 
Wotan, Admiral Tyrr — ” 

“No, Loki — Not for a long 
time now. You might ask Xix how 
long.” 

“Commander — we will listen 
no longer to this treacher! Charge 
the coil! Our time runs out!” 
“Ask him wHat his Hurry is, 
Loki. Ask him wKat it is He’s so 
eager to accomplish.” 

“To leave this world, what 
else?” the ktill said. 

“Ask him about the beacon.” 
“What does the beacon have 
to do witfi it?” 

“He raves, my commander,” 
the kiill whined. 

“Ask him about the storm,” 
Grayle said. “Ask him what He 
had to do with that!” 

Falconer looked across at the 
great black entity. “Answer,” He 
said. 

“Very well — but we waste 
precious seconds. My instruments 
told me that the beacon device 
had been placed on the surface, 
but only the basic protective 
field was energized, due to tfie 
1S8 



sabotage of the traitor. My first 
act when I began to draw energy 
from the primitive broadcast field 
was to transmit the ‘proceed’ sig- 
nal on the Y band for crust pene- 
tration, using a matter-annihila- 
tion beam. Naturally, a side-effect 
of weather disturbance was cre- 
ated. The device is now well with- 
in the planetary interior. Once 
we are clear of the planet, it will 
require only the final triggering 
pulse to the reactor to ignite the 
beacon. But we must act swiftly! 
If the triggering signal is not re- 
ceived within a period of hours, 
the device self-destructs!” 

“Cancel that,” Falconer said. 
“We’re not going to activate tJie 
beacon. It won’t be needed now. 
Not after all these years.” 

“Not perform our clear duty?” 
“It’s not our duty — not any 
more.” 

“I fail to understand what cir- 
cumstances you conceive could 
relieve us of responsibility for 
completion of a Fleet mission.” 

tt^'T^ime! A great deal of time 
-*■ has passed. If the beacon 
had been needed another ship 
would have been sent out.” 
“How does the passage of a 
few days influence the Ysarian 
Grand Strategy?” 

“Over twelve hundred local 
years is more than a few days.” 
“What is this talk of centuries? 
Is it perhaps intended as a jest?” 

GALAXY 



“Don’t you know Kow long we 
have been here?” 

“Since our arrival at this world, 
less than ten thousand hours have 
elapsed, a little over a year.” 
“Something interfered with 
your chronometry, Xix. You’re 
wrong by a factor of a thousand.” 
“I am incapable of error with- 
in my design parameters. The 
need for the beacon is as great 
as ever. Accordingly, I will trig- 
ger it as planned. I can agree 
with no other course.” 

“You can agree? You’re a ma- 
chine. You follow orders.” 

“My ultimate responsibility is 
to Battle Command. Its directives 
override your authority, Com- 
mander. The beacon will be acti- 
vated as planned. Let us hope 
that the White Fleet has not suf- 
fered reverses in battle for lack 
of it.” 

“I think I understand,” Falcon- 
er said. “Xix, you’ve been on Q- 
status for most of the past twelve 
centuries. Your chironometric 
sensors only registered the periods 
of awareness.” 

“It is correct that I Have from 
time to time reverted to Q status 
as a power conservation measure. 
But I fail to grasp your impli- 
cation tliat this status has dimen- 
sional characteristics.” 

“It means,” Grayle said, “that 
as far as it’s concerned, when it’s 
switched off, nothing is happen- 
ing.” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



“The phenomenal world exists 
only during active status,” Xix 
said calmly. “This is confirmed 
not only by basic rationality, but 
by the absence of sensory input 
during such periods.” 

“I see. You don’t shut yourself 
off. You turn off the world.” 
“These are mere semantic nice- 
ties, 'my Commander.” 

“How do you account for the 
fact that when you reactivate, 
you find that changes have taken 
place around you?” 

“I have observed that it is a 
characteristic of the Universe to 
reform in somewhat altered state 
after a discontinuity.” 

“What about the power broad- 
cast you’re drawing on? You 
think the savages I found here 
a millennium ago could have built 
that transmitter in six weeks?” 
“A manifestation of the dis- 
continuity effect previously noted. 
I had intended to discuss these 
phenomena with you at leisure, 
possibly during the voyage 
home.” 

“Do you realize,” Falconer 
said, “that when you transmit 
that signal youll tarn the planet 
into a minor sun?” 

“That is correct,” tlie krill said. 
“For the love of Ysar, Xix! Lis- 
ten to me!” 

“For the love of Ysar, my com- 
mander, I cannot. Now let us pro- 
ceed with that which must be 
done.” 



“Tell it to go to tlie Nintfi 
Hell,” Grayle said tHickly. 

“Come, my commander. You 
know that without the coil I — 
and you — can never leave this 
world. And time grows short.” 
“Don’t do it, Loki.” Grayle 
said. “Let the ship rot where it 



^^he krill seemed to smile at 
Falconer, baring a serrated 
ridge of ivory white. “Without 
power, I carmot lift, true. But I 
will not come to an end by slow 
decay. Nor by the chemical 
bombs of the primitives. Reflect: 
the Y-field is still at operational 
level, is it not? I can trigger the 
beacon at any moment — from 
here.” 

“And incinerate yourself along 
with the rest of the planet.” 

“I have no alternative but to 
perform my duty. Your betrayal 
will change nothing — except that 
you will not live to see Ysar. I 
will regret your death. A useless 
death, Lokrien.” 

“If I agree,” Falconer said, 
“will you contact a Fleet Outpost 
for confirmation before you trig- 
ger the Hellcore?” 

“It will mean a dangerous de- 
lay. But — yes, as you wish. I 
agree.” 

“It’s lying,” Grayle said. “As 
it’s lied all along.” 

“Enough!” the kiill said, rising 
to all fours. “Proceed now, my 
190 



commander! I can wait no 
longer!” 

As Falconer hesitated, there was 
a sudden sharp sound from the 
door twenty feet distant in the 
end wall. It swung open, and a 
slim figure in a trench coat step- 
ped through, hesitated. Her eyes 
found Grayle. In that instant, the 
krill couched, leaped. Even more 
swiftly, Grayle moved, sprang 
between the beast and the girl. 
The krill struck him full on, 
knocked him back against the 
girl. She fell under their feet as 
Grayle rose. His Hands locked on 
the beast’s throat, while its talons 
raked savagely across him from 
throat to groin. 

“Xix!” Falconer roared, and the 
cat-thing crouched away, while 
Grayle staggered, blood flooding 
down across his shredded jacket. 

“You asked me once . where 
I’d seen wounds like those be- 
fore,” he said between his clench- 
ed teeth. “I thought then you 
mocked me.” 

“I saw John Zabisky,” Falcon- 
er said. “And tlie dead soldier on 
the trail.” 

“There was another time . 
long ago, Loki. In a house built 
of timbers on a rocky hill among 
the snows. A woman and a child. 
Gudred, my wife, and Loki, my 
son.” He looked across at Fal- 
coner. “May the Nine Gods for- 
give me, I thought you’d made 
them.” 



GALAXY 



TT'aJconer’s face turned to a rigid 
-*■ mask. His eyes locked witK 
tiiose of tKe krill. 

“You killed them,” lie said. 
“And let ’Thor believe I did it.” 

“It was necessary,” tKe krill 
hissed. “He would Have subverted 
you from your duty!” 

“In tKe name of Ysar, you’ve 
betrayed everything that Ysar 
ever meant!” 

“Ysar!” the krill yowled. “I 
weary of the name Ysar, and of 
your foolish sentimentality! Ysar 
is dead, dead these Hundred cen- 
turies! But you live — as I live 

— eternally! Let that reality sus- 
tain you! Now do your duty. 
Commander!” 

“He’s telling the truth for 
once,” Grayle said. “Ysar is dead, 
and only Her undying machines 

— and a handful of immortal 
men — act out the dead dream.” 

“But — I remember Ysar. .” 

“Your memories are false,” the 
krill said. “You were bom aboard 
sliip, Lokrien, nurtured in an am- 
niotic tank, educated by cyber- 
tape! You were given the vision 
of that which once was and is no 
more to inspire you in the per- 
formance of your duty. But sure- 
ly now we can dispense with cKild- 
isH images! You live for your 
duty to Battle Command, as I 
do! Now let me kill tKe traitor, 
and we will be on our way, once 
again to voyage outward, at Home 
in the great emptiness of Space!” 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



“Loki, it’s bluffing! Without 
the coil, it dies — because that’s 
what it draws its power from. 
That’s wKy it came along — to 
keep an eye on the coil! Destroy 
it, and you destroy the ship — 
and its murderous robot with it!” 
“Commander! PerKaps I erred 
througK overzealousness. But if 
you destroy the coil, you die too!” 
“Do it now, Loki!” 

“Fools!” the krill raged. “I 
tried to spare you the last, full 
knowledge of yourselves, but you 
leave me no cEoice. Trae, I am 
a construct of Xix, linked to the 
neural circuity of the ship, and 
with tKe death’ of tKe ^p I die. 
But you, too, are constracts! Kill 
me, and you kill yourselves! Let 
me live, and yours is life eternal 
— even for tlie treacher, Gralga- 
tKor!” 

Grayle gave a sKort, EarsH 
laugh. “If we’re constmcts, we’re 
able to do what a man would 
do.” 

“I move swiftly, Lokrien — 
perhaps more swiftly than you 
think.” 

Falconer looked at tKe cat- 
tHing, crouched, tail lasKing, its 
eyes locked on him. He looked at 
Grayle, waiting, ignoring the ter- 
rible wounds across his cEest. 

“If I destroy tSe coil, we all 
die,” he said softly, in English. 
“If I don’t — tKe EartH dies.” 
“Decide, Commander,” tKe 
krill said. “I will wait no longer.”

J ess Dooley peered down into 
the gloom at th’e blurred fig- 
ures below. He couldn’t make out 
the details, just vague dark shapes 
against a deeper darkness. 

Until just now he Hadn’t Had a 
clue as to what was going on; only 
that it was killing business. But 
he’d heard what the last fellow 
said, in plain American, about the 
Earth dying. That was clear 
enough. Everybody said World 
War Three wouldn’t leave enough 
pieces to pick up for anybody 
to bother. Looked like the Rus- 
sians were having words about — 
whatever it was they came Here to 
do. One of them, the mean-voiced 
one, was for doing it right off. 
The other one, with tKe deep 
voice, was against it. And tfie 
third one wasn’t sure. But He’d 
be making up His mind in a min- 
ute. 

Jess got silently to His Hand 
and knees. He wasn’t sure yet 
just what He was going to do — 
but he knew that he’d Have to 
do sometfiing, even if it was 
wrong. He blinked, trying to pen- 
etrate the blindness, trying to get 
a good look at the fellow with 
tHe dead man’s voice. He was tKe 
one to watcK, the one to stop. If 
he’d just move a little more tHis 
way.

umpK, took two swift paces, rear- 
ed above Grayle — 

From the shadows above a 
dark shape leaped, struck the cat- 
thing full across the back, unbal- 
ancing it enough that the stroke 
of its taloned paw went wide. 
It bucked, threw tfie man off, 
spun to leap at Falconer — 

Fire burst from the KatcH. In 
mid-spring, the cat-creature’s 
body contorted; it struck tKe 
metal side of the machine, sprawl- 
ed away from it, its limbs raking 
futilely in a last effort to reacH 
Falconer, who sagged against tKe 
side of tfie unit, shaking Kis Head 
dizzzily. Grayle clung to tKe wall, 
figHting to stay on his feet. 

“It Ked . , . again,” he whis- 
pered. 

TKe krill lay limply; tHe light 
still glowed, but weakly, fading 
from tHe great eyes. It spoke in 
a dying voice: 

“THe long twifight . ends at 
last ... in nigKt.” 

CCT’m aU right, man,” Dooley 
said as Falconer lifted Kim 
to Kis feet. “Don’t tell me wKat 
that was I jumped. I don’t want 
to know. Just get me out of this 
place.” 

“It’s dead.” Falconer said. 
“And tKe generators are stop- 
ping.” 

“But we’re still alive,” Grayle 
said. “Tfiat means we’re bio-con- 
structs, not mecKanical. And now

we’re mortal creatures. We’ll age 
and die like any man.” 

Falconer went to Anne, lifted 
Ker in His arms. “Until then we 
can live like any man.” 

They made their way up the 
echoing concrete steps, along tlie 
empty corridors. The first light of 
day gleamed beyond the shatter- 
ed entrance. Already the wind 
was dying, tlie rain abating. 

As the two men stepped out 
through the scattered rubble, light 
glinted on the dark hillside. 
Grayle leaped and cried out as a 
single shot rang out from the 
wooded slope above the building. 

^aptain Zwicky, coming up si- 
^ lently behind the man who 
lay in prone firing position be- 
hind tlie big pine, saw the stir of 
movement in the shattered en- 
trance below, saw the two men 
step into view, heard the flat 



crack of the gun, threw himself 
on Harmon as he relaid his sights 
for the second shot. 

“Why did you shoot him?” 
Zwicky touted at the policeman 
as the latter wiped a big hand 
across his bloodied mouth. 
“Why?” 

“Because,” Harmon said v/ith 
total conviction, “the son of a 
bitch thought he was better than 
I was.” 

CCT’m sorry, brother,” Falconer 
-*■ said. “Sorry for everything, 
but most of all for this.” 

“Xix was right,” Grayle whis- 
pered. “But only half right. Even 
the longest night . ends at 
dawn.” 

Carrying Anne, Falconer walk- 
ed out across the dark lawn to- 
ward the waiting men.

Happened while he was still in

Naturally it made little sense.
