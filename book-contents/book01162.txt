STRATEGY & TACTICS is a magazine. It's 
also a lool: a time machine that enables you 
lo replay the crucial events - past, present, 
and future — lhal shape our lives. 

Now. instead ol merely reading about what's 
happening, you can explore and experience 
the allernatives and decision points through 
the technique of Conflict Simulation. 

What la Conflict Simulation? 

Confhcl Simulation is a way of analyzing a 
political or military conflict siiualion A way 
That 'S as intellectually stimulating as a game 
ofchess, and as thorough as a written analysis. 

Through the use of the Conflict Simulation 
(or "game ") format, the conflict situation is 
re-created — so lhal you are in a posihon to 
make ihe vital decisions and, m ihe game at 
least, change the way things were, are, or 
will be 

What you gal 

STRATEGY* TACTICS magazine is publish- 
ed bi-monthly. Each issue contains: 

*A ready-to-play conflict-simulation game 
with a 22 x 28 playing surface, die-cut play- 



ing pieces, and complete rules. 

* An analytical article on (he same subject as 
ihe game m that issue. 

* Other feature articles on historical and 
military subjects. 

* Game and book reviews, commentary on 
existing games, and discussions of subscribers' 
questions 

The magazine is 48 + pages long, and all 
material is handled in a highly organized (and 
easily understandable) graphic formal. 

Games recently published m STRATEGY & 
TACTICS were GRUNT (ground combat in 
V elnam). LOST BATTLES (tactical combat in 
Russia, 1941-44). USN (the war m the Pacific 
1941-43), COMBAT COMMAND (tactical com- 
bat >n Western Europe. >944).

DIRECTIONS 

Directions: 

I've been reading the letters 
published in Directions and seem to de- 
tect a trend toward dealing with science 
fiction as “Literature" or "Art." 
Despite the fact that I’m one of those 
college professors who are ruining the 
field by teaching courses in it. I’m not 
sure I'm entirely happy with this 
development. So much of what we hear 
from individuals like Pierce or Chauvin 
isn't really criticism. 

Science-fiction readers have suddenly 
become terribly conscious of the fact 
that they are no longer living in a 
literary ghetto. We get individuals like 
A. J. Budrys dropping out of active re- 
viewing and P. Schuyler Miller apolo- 
gizing for not being an "intellectual. " 

I'm not saying that we should revert 
to the old lettercols when every other 
word was: "Wow!" " Fantastic !" or 
" Supergalactic !" Criticism is neces- 
sary, particularly if you consider 
the critical act as one which 
demonstrates value where none was 
perceived before. There are, however, 
two types of critical work. One is an 
extremely complicated, technical 
exercise practiced by PhDs in Literary 
Criticism that bears about as much 
relationship to writing as the 
theoretical physicist bears to a TV re- 



pairman putting in a new picture tube. 
One man works with theory: the other 
makes it work. 

Judy Merril, whatever you thought 
about her championing of the New 
Wave and Speculative Tabulation, was 
and is a damn good writer who paid her 
dues grinding out pulp fiction and 
polishing her craft. Her critical works 
are the gut reaction of a sensitive indi- 
vidual who perceives something of 
value and worth in the neglected and 
otherwise unremarked stories that 
came to her attention. Blish and Knight 
are good writers who have given ex- 
cellent technical critiques of the craft. 

Alexei and Cory Panshin are writers 
who have bothered to master the jargon 
and technical tools of literary criticism 
and can speak from both the theoretical 
and practical viewpoint. None of these 
three groups of critics is inherently 
“ better " than the others. All are good 
because they excel in the areas they 
have delineated for themselves. I much 
prefer what Budrys or Miller or Stur- 
geon write in their review columns to 
what a dozen dogmatic pseudo-critics 
churn out. 

The prime idiocy of all this critical 
jousting is the attempt to define sf. 
Science fiction is not a genre but a tech- 
nique. Genre criticism is only one way 
of approaching a work of fiction and, to 
my mind, it’s not the best. If I wish to 
use a Socialist Realism framework in 
my criticism I can easily demonstrate 
that Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is bet- 
ter hardcore sf than Larry Niven’s 
Ringworld. Using a Formalist ap- 
proach I can show that Lord of the 
Rings isn't even a novel and that 25% of 
what is published in the sf magazines 
isn't even fiction.

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

Story opens with undercover agent 
CARLOS DEPEA UX trying to blend 
with southeast Oregon scenery while 
keeping a careful watch on an innoc- 
uous farmhouse through powerful bi- 
noculars. Some distance away his 
fellow agent, a girl named TYMIENA, 
keeps the farm under electronic and 
radar surveillance from a specially 
equipped van camper. Ostensibly 
CARLOS and TYMIENA are nature- 
loving husband and wife on a camper 
vacation — CARLOS is a birdwatcher , 
if anyone should ask. 

He is, however, chilled by a growing 
awareness that he is the only life 
form — other than plants — in the 
vicinity of the farm. There are no birds. 




no animals small or large, not even f 
insects around. Adding to his unease is 
the knowledge that his predecessor, j 

PORTER, vanished without a trace 
while watching this same lack-life 
farm. Carlos knows, of course, that 
the farm's proprietor, NILS 
HELLSTROM, is no farmer, but is 
noted for making documentary films ' 
about insects. He is also suspected of 
being in the process of developing a 
superweapon that would give world do- i 

minion to any nation possessing J 

it — and no one is quite sure of 
HELLSTROM'S loyalties. The 
weapon is described as a "toroidal field 
disruptor," is capable of altering mat- 
ter over great distances and its exis- 
tence has been deduced from specifica- 
tions that a HELLSTROM aide

While the task force, under 
JANVERT, keeps HELLSTROM'S 
farm under discreet surveillance, PE- 
RUGE attempts to find out what has 
happened to CARLOS and 
TYMIENA from local Sheriffs 
Deputy LINCOLN KRAFT. He be- 
comes convinced — and correctly — that 
KRAFT is one of HELLSTROM'S 
people. PERUGE forces KRAFT to 
take him to the farm, where 
HELLSTROM receives him openly, 
takes him on a tour of his movie studio. 
There PERUGE meets lovely FANCY 
KALOTERMI, a HELLSTROM aid, 
whose Hive-conditioned breeding in- 
stincts become aroused. 

That same night, however, young 
FANCY meets PERUGE in his motel 
room in town and, after using a Hive 
“breeding" formula on him, subjects 
him to such vigorous activity that in the 
morning — after warning JANVERT 
by radio — PERUGE collapses and 
dies. Of exhaustion — or from the 
HIVE formula? 

XXII 

The Wisdom of Harl: By the 
stance you take against the 
universe it is possible to destroy 
yourself. 

H ELLSTROM turned left into 
the main gallery outside the 
Security chamber instead of going 
directly to his cell. He swung left 
again down a side ramp and, at the 
ramp’s end, entered the opened gap 
of an express elevator when a car 
appeared. He jumped out of the 
moving car at Level Fifty-one into 
another wide gallery. This one 
showed less activity than the upper 
chambers and conveyed a deep 



sensation of cushioned stillness. 
Workers here moved with a cat- 
footed softness and a sense of silent 
importance. 

Hellstrom made his way among 
them and not until he was actually 
walking through the widely arched 
entrance to the Project 40 lab did he 
begin to review what he would tell 
the specialists. 

Outsiders think this is an 
invention dealing with the making 
and forming of metals such as steel. 
They obtained this impression from 
studying only pages 17 through 41 
of Report TRZ88a. They obviously 
are aware of the heat problem from 
knowing about only this tiny part of 
your work. 

That should do it. Brief enough to 
satisfy the Physical Researchers’ 
characteristic impatience with all 
interruptions, but containing the 
essential information plus his own 
primary observation. 

Hellstrom stopped just inside the 
doorway of the cavernous, domed 
lab to await a break in the activities 
that would allow his interruption. 
One did not intrude here except on 
the most urgent matters. These spe- 
cialists were notoriously short- 
tempered. 

T wenty of them were at work on 
a massive tubular object in the 
brilliantly floodlighted center of the 
lab, each specialist attended by a 
muscular symbiote. These Physical 
Researchers were precious to the 
Hive and so difficult to bring into 
being, so difficult to maintain even 
then. Their gigantic heads — fifteen 
inches from a snowy hairline to the 
bottom of a hairless chin, eleven 
inches across the brow above 
bulging blue eyes that stood out

GALAXY 




with a startling glitter in their black 
skins — told of the caesarian birth 
of each of them. No female had 
ever borne more than three — 
breeding was limited by many 
natural abortions in early preg- 
nancy. Death of the mother at birth 
was common with these prized spe- 
cialists — a price the Hive paid 
willingly. The Researchers had 
proved their worth countless times 
and were a major reason the First 
Colonists had ended their centuries 
of secretive migrations. These spe- 
cialists must be concealed from 
Outsider eyes at all costs. Their 
work must be hidden as well — it 
stamped the Hive-born with 
another kind of strangeness. The 
stunwand, of which Project 40 was 
an outgrowth, was only one of their 
creations. They had given the 
Hive’s electronic instruments a 
marked edge in reliability, subtlety 
and power. They had produced the 
newest refinements in food addi- 
tives. 

The Physical Researchers were 
instantly recognizable as different 
from any other worker. The gene 
line that produced them carried 
characteristics incapable of being 
separated from the sought-after 
specialization and marked them as 
even further differentiated from the 
original wild form. Their legs were 
stunted stumps and each Re- 
searcher required the constant at- 
tendance of a pale, muscular, 
chemically neutered worker bred 
especially for brawn and a pliable 
disposition. Because of the useless 
legs these specialists were wheeled 
about on spidery carts or carried in 
the attendants’ arms. Although the 
Researchers’ arms were not 



stunted, they were spindly and 
weak, with hands that bore long, 
delicate fingers. These specialists 
were also genetically sterile, each 
one a single creation ending in its 
own flesh. Since their driving need 
for full intellect meant they could 
not have their emotions chemically 
tempered, they tended to a touchy 
irascibility in their dealings with all 
other workers: Even their symbiote 
attendants came in for such at- 
tacks. The Researchers were gentle 
and showed a high degree of mutual 
consideration with their fellow spe- 
cialists, however — a characteristic 
the Hive had managed to breed into 
them after a series of conflicts had 
reduced the usefulness of the first of 
the type. 

One of the busily working spe- 
cialists finally stopped, peered 
across the lab at Hellstrom and sig- 
naled in Hive-sign: Don’t delay 
this. In the same movement of hand 
and fingers the specialist pressed 
further symbols upon its forehead: 
Your interruptive presence delays 
my thinking. 

Hellstrom hurried briskly across 
the room. He recognized the Re- 
searcher as one of the elders in this 
breed, a female whose skin bore nu- 
merous ropy scars of experiments 
gone awry. She was attended by a 
pale, bent-shouldered neuter-male 
whose arms and torso bulged with 
muscles. The latter watched in 
cowed diffidence as Hellstrom 
flashed his report in abbreviated 
Hive-sign. 

What do we care what Outsiders 
believe? she demanded. 

They were able to deduce the heat 
problem from just these few pages , 
Hellstrom signaled. 



PROJECT 40

She spoke aloud then, knowing 
that voice could convey more of her 
irritation. “You think Outsiders 
can teach us?” 

“We often learn from their mis- 
takes,” Hellstrom said, refusing to 
respond to her anger. 

“Be still a moment,” she ordered 
and closed her eyes. 

Hellstrom knew those reference 
pages would be flashing before her 
awareness, the data on them being 
correlated with their present work 
and Peruge’s mistaken belief. 

Presently she opened her eyes and 
said, “Go away.” 

“Does this help you?” Hell- 
strom asked. 

“It helps,” she said, emitting the 
admission in a grudging growl and 
adding with a return of her former 
irritability: “Apparently your type 
can learn an occasional thing of 
value — when you have a lucky 
accident.” 

Hellstrom managed to restrain a 
grin until he had turned away and 
was headed back across the lab. 
When he glanced back from the 
doorway he saw several specialists 
clustered into a busily communi- 
cative group, their hands darting 
and flashing in Hive-sign. He 
caught the symbol for heat several 
times, but most of the other 
symbols escaped him. The Re- 
searchers had developed their own 
special language for use among 
themselves, he knew. They would 
have this new data all sorted out 
and introduced into their project in 
a very short time. 



Privately circulated memo to 
the Agency board members: 



DESTROY THIS IMMEDIATELY 

after reading. There is more 
to the Hellstrom File than we 
have been shown. They are 
holding out on us. Our other 
source says the MIT papers 
contained at least three addi- 
tional pages. These indicate 
that Project 40 involves a new 
and far cheaper process of 
manufacturing and forming 
steel and that it is not a weapon 
at all. As 1 have told you all 
time and again, I knew this pair 
would try something like this 
on their own some day. They 
are through as of now! 

Mimeca Tichenum’s report on 
Outside use of Hive stores: 
Within a few seconds after in- 
jection of our breeder formula 
the skin of the Outsider male 
becomes warm to the touch and 
somewhat flushed. This is 
similar to the reaction of Hive 
males, but more pronounced, 
also more rapid. The reaction 
takes no more than five to ten 
seconds. The dissimilarities 
then become quite pronounced. 
The Outsider male sometimes 
displays an initial muscle ri- 
gidity, in actuality a shock 
response, which holds him vir- 
tually immobile until the major 
breeder transformations have 
occurred. Concurrent with 
these the male emits a bitter- 
smelling perspiration which ap- 
pears to be characteristic in all 
cases and which I find 
extremely exciting. It appears 
to accelerate and heighten the 
full spectrum of my female 
breeding responses. This bitter 



10 



GALAXY 




smell may represent a hormone 
in the same class as our XB5 
formula which, you will recall, 
elicits a quite similar female 
response, although one not as 
extreme as what I am 
describing. In general, I would 
say that those elements of the 
usual Hive breeding responses 
which are conscious initially 
among our males tend, with 
Outsider males, to be involun- 
tary when subjects are injected 
with our male breeder hor- 
mones. My own personal 
reaction (in which my sisters 
concur) is to find these Out- 
sider responses tremendously 
more stimulating than the 
usual Hive breeding responses. 

T 'HE hour was twenty minutes 
to twelve and for the past thirty 
minutes Hellstrom had been pacing 
about the farmhouse dining room 
wondering if his preparations were 
adequate. The room had been 
decorated originally as a front 
showpiece, a place to entertain the 
occasional Outsider business con- 
tact. A long Jacobean table with 
ten matching chairs around it was 
the central feature. A polished glass 
chandelier glittered over the table. 
A breakfront china cabinet stacked 
with heavy blue crockery dishes oc- 
cupied almost all of one wall op- 
posite the arch to the living room. 
Bay windows, tall and many-paned, 
faded lace curtains drawn back 
from them, gave a view of willows 
along the creek bank. A swinging 
door with a tiny glass window inset 
near the top opened into the 
kitchen. 

Four places had been set at the 



kitchen end of the large table. 

The closer the hour of Peruge’s 
arrival, the thinner Hellstrom’s ear- 
lier elation had worn — and now Pe- 
ruge was late. 

Mimeca was helping in the 
kitchen. And from time to time 
Hellstrom glimpsed her through the 
glass inset in the door. She was 
enough like Fancy to be a gene- 
sister, but Mimeca was from a 
parallel breeding strain, not the 
FANCY line. The dark hair and 
pale, faintly rosy skin seemed to 
have linked itself genetically to 
other characteristics the Hive 
sought in its breeders — high fer- 
tility, independence of imagination, 
drive to succeed, loyalty and 
intelligence. 

Hellstrom glanced at the old- 
fashioned pendulum clock beside 
the door to the kitchen. A quarter 
to twelve and still no sign of Pe- 
ruge. Why would he be late? What 
if he had decided not to come, but 
to take some other action? Could he 
already have discovered something 
incriminating about that damned 
bicycle? Peruge was perfectly ca- 
pable of showing up with the FBI. 
But with Mimeca playing the role 
of Fancy, the Hive might yet con- 
found the hunters. Fingerprints 
would not match. She had not been 
bred recently and that could be 
proved by medical examination. He 
would insist upon an Outside 
medical examination. That would 
serve the double purpose of getting 
every one of the intruders away 
from here. 

He heard the outer door to the 
front hall open. 

Could that be Peruge at last? 

Hellstrom strode through the 



PROJECT 40 



11 




archway into the living room 
featuring early twentieth-century 
furnishings and carefully main- 
tained musty smells. As quickly as 
he went, he was only half way 
across the room when a stranger 
entered two steps ahead of Saldo. 
The. stranger was a diminutive 
male — an inch or so shorter than 
Saldo — with windblown brown 
hair, a cautiously reserved manner 
behind the eyes. He appeared to be 
only in his early twenties, but 
Hellstrom sometimes had found 
age difficult to determine with 
small Outsiders. The stranger wore 
tan work pants, heavy boots, a 
white turtleneck shirt of some light 
fabric that allowed reddish chest 
hairs to poke through. A brown 
buckram jacket with slash pockets 
had been pulled over the shirt. The 
right-side pocket bulged as though 
it concealed a gun. Pale yellow 
grass seeds could be seen sticking in 
the man’s trouser cuffs. 

He stopped short when he saw 
Hellstrom, then barked: “You are 
Hellstrom?” 

Saldo, two paces behind the 
stranger, flashed a warning signal 
in Hive-sign. 

“Dr. Hellstrom, this is Mr. 
Janvert, an associate of Mr. Pe- 
ruge’s. Mr. Janvert parked his car 
down by the old sawmill turn and 
walked in across the meadow.” 

Walked in? Hellstrom wondered. 
Reference to that route across the 
meadow bothered him. That was 
the path Depeaux had taken. 

Saldo moved to stand on 
Janvert’s right, again flashed a 
warning signal, said, “Mr. Janvert 
has shocking news. He tells me that 
Mr. Peruge is dead.” 



T HE information momentarily 
stunned Hellstrom. He tried to 
assess it, his mind racing. Fancy? 
No, she had said nothing about . 
He saw that some response was ex- 
pected, allowed his surprise to come 
out naturally. 

“Dead? But I was — ” Hellstrom 
gestured toward the dining room — 
“expecting — I mean, we’d made 
another date for — What happened? 
How did he die?” 

“We’re still trying to find out,” 
Janvert said. “Your deputy tried to 
prevent our taking the body, but we 
got a court order from a Federal 
judge in Salem. Peruge’s body is on 
its way to the University of Oregon 
Medical School in Portland.” 
Janvert seemed to be assessing 
Hellstrom’s response. “We’ll have 
an autopsy report very soon.” 
Hellstrom pursed his lips. He 
didn’t like the way Janvert had said 
your deputy . What had Line 
done? Were there more mistakes to 
contend with? 

“If Deputy Kraft interfered, 
that’s regrettable,” Hellstrom said, 
“but that certainly has nothing to 
do with me. He is not our deputy.” 
“Let’s stop the bullshit,” Janvert 
said. “One of your dames spent last 
night with Peruge and she shot him 
full of some kind of dope. There 
was a bruise on his arm as big as a 
dollar. We’re going to find out what 
that was. We’re going to bring in 
the FBI, the Alcohol Tax people — 
they deal with narcotics crimes, you 
know — and we’re going to open 
your farm up like a can of rotten 
worms!” 

“Just a minute now,” Hellstrom 
said, trying to suppress his panic. 
Open up the farm! “What’s this

about someone spending the night 
with Mr. Peruge? Narcotics? What 
are you saying?” 

“A hot little doll from your outfit 
by the name of Fancy,” Janvert 
said. “Fancy Kalotermi, I think her 
full name is. She spent last night 
with Peruge and she shot him full 
of—” 

“This is nonsense,” Hellstrom 
interrupted. “Are you saying one 
of — Fancy? She had some sort of 
sexual liaison with Mr. Peruge, did 
she not?” 

“Did she ever! Peruge told me the 
whole story. She shot him full of 
dope and we’re betting that’s what 
killed him. We’re going to question 
your Miss Kalotermi and the rest 
of your people. We’re going to get 
to the bottom of this.” 

Saldo cleared his throat, trying to 
distract Janvert, give Hellstrom 
time to think. These words pointed 
in profoundly disturbing directions. 
Saldo felt all of his Hive-defense 
reactions coming to full-alarm 
state. He had to restrain himself 
consciously from launching a 
phy sical attack on Janvert. 

Janvert spared only a glance for 
Saldo. “You got something to 
add?” 

Before Saldo could respond 
Hellstrom asked, “Who is this ‘we’ 
you keep referring to, Mr. Janvert? 

I confess I don’t understand this at 
all. I had taken a liking to Mr. Pe- 
ruge and he — ” 

“Don’t spare any of your liking 
for me,” Janvert said. “1 don’t go 
for the way you like people. As for 
your question — it has a simple 
answer. The FBI will be here 
presently and Alcohol Tax officers. 
If we think of any others who want 



to share in this investigation we’ll 
invite them.” 

“But you have no official 
standing, Mr. Janvert — is that 
right?” 

Janvert took a moment to 
reassess Hellstrom. There had been 
an edge to the question he did not 
like. Janvert moved unconsciously 
a pace away from Saldo. 

“Is that correct?” Hellstrom 
insisted. 

Janvert set his jaw belligerently. 
“You’d better be damn careful 
about my official standing, 
Hellstrom. Your Miss Kalotermi 
rode a bicycle to Peruge’ s motel. 
That bicycle was the property of 
one Carlos Depeaux, another of our 
people we suspect you took a liking 
to.” 

Stalling for time to think, 
Hellstrom said; “You’re going too 
fast for me. Who is this — oh, yes, 
the employe Mr. Peruge was 
seeking. I don’t understand about a 
bicycle, but — Are you trying to tell 
me you also work for this fireworks 
company, Mr. Janvert?” 

“You’re going to see more than 
fireworks around here in a bit,” 
Janvert said. “Where is Miss Kalo- 
termi?” 

Hellstrom’s mind was turning 
over possible responses at top 
speed. His first reaction was to be 
thankful he had had the foresight to 
get Fancy out of sight in Gestation 
and substitute Mimeca. The very 
worst had happened — they had 
traced that damned bicycle! Still 
stalling for time, he said, “I’m 
afraid I don’t know exactly where 
Miss — ” 

Mimeca took this moment to 
step through the arch from the 



14 



GALAXY 




dining room. The kitchen door 
could be heard slapping to a closed 
position behind her. She evidently 
assumed Janvert was the expected 
luncheon guest. 

“There you are,” she said. 
“Lunch is getting cold.” 



<< ^/TELL, here she is now,” 
W Hellstrom said, flashing a 
signal for Mimeca to be silent. 
“Fancy, this is Mr. Janvert. He has 
brought us sorrowful news. Mr. Pe- 
ruge is dead under circumstances 
that sound rather mysterious.” 
“How awful!” she exclaimed, 
responding to another signal from 
Hellstrom. 

Hellstrom looked at Janvert, 
wondering if the substitution would 
be accepted. Mimeca Fitted Fancy’s 
description very closely. Even their 
voices were similar. 

Janvert glared at her, demanded, 
“Where the hell did you get that 
bicycle? What kind of dope did you 
use to kill Peruge?” 

Mimeca put a hand to her mouth, 
startled. The anger mixed with fear 
obvious in Janvert, the sharp voice 
and unexpected questions, all 
seemed to confuse her. 

“Just a minute here.” Hellstrom 
signaled in Hivesign for her to 
follow his lead. He faced her 
squarely, a stern look on his face, 
spoke like a demanding parent. 
“Fancy, I want you to tell me the 
truth. Did you spend last night with 
Mr. Peruge at the motel?” 

“With — ” She shook her head 
dumbly from side to side. 
Hellstrom knew his alarm was a 
palpable thing to her and she could 
see Saldo actually trembling. The 



silence in the room became deep 
and charged while she framed her 
answer. “I — of course not!” she 
said. “You both know that. I was 
here in the — ” 

She broke off. Hellstrom guessed 
she had almost said Hive. The 
extreme tensions in this room car- 
ried a deeply disturbing current. He 
signaled her to get herself under 
better control. 

“She was here in the house last 
night,” Saldo said. “I saw her 
myself.” 

“So that’s the way you’re going 
to play it.” Janvert stared at Mi- 
meca. “There’s going to be more 
law swarming over this place in a 
couple of hours than you’ve ever 
seen — they are going to pick her up 
for questioning. Don’t try to hide 
her or sneak her away. Her finger- 
prints were all over that bicycle and 
all over Peruge’s room. She’s going 
to have some mighty interesting 
questions to answer.” 

“That may be so,” Hellstrom 
said, his voice firming as he saw his 
preparations providing the escape 
route he had anticipated. Mimeca’s 
fingerprints were all over nothing. 
“But you, I take it, Mr. Janvert, 
are not the law. Until the law — ” 

“I told you to can the bullshit,” 
Janvert said. 

“I can understand why you’re 
upset,” Hellstrom said, “but 1 do 
not care for your tone or your at- 
titude — or for your choice of lan- 
guage in front of this young 
woman. I am going to have to ask 
you — ” 

“What are you trying to pull 
off?” Janvert demanded. “Choice 
of language in front of this young 
woman? She was bedded with Pe- 



PROJECT 40

ruge last night and she knew more 
tricks than he’d ever heard of. 
Choice of words?” 

“That is really quite enough!” 
Hellstrom exploded. He signaled 
frantically for Mimeca to leave in a 
huff, but she seemed too intent now 
on Jan vert to notice. 

“Bedded?” she demanded, “I 
don’t even know your Mr. Peruge,” 

“That won’t work, sister,” 
Janvert said. “I promise you, it 
won’t work.” 

“You don’t have to answer any 
more of his questions, Fancy,” 
Hellstrom said. 

“That’s right,” Janvert said, 
“shut her up until you get your 
stories straight. But I promise you, 
it won’t work. The physical evi- 
dence — ” 

“Indeed,” Hellstrom interrupted. 
“The physical evidence.” He sighed 
with elaborate sadness. It was going 
perfectly. He faced Mimeca. 
“Fancy, my dear, you don’t have to 
say another thing until the officials 
get here, if they do indeed choose to 
come for such an outrageous — ” 

“Oh, they’ll come,” Janvert said. 
“And when they do 1 expect some 
damned interesting answers based 
on the physical evidence.” 

S ALDO, still trying to suppress 
his Hive-protection condi- 
tioning, gestured to catch 
Hellstrom’s attention, asked, 
“Nils— should I put him off the 
place?” 

“That won’t be necessary,” 
Hellstrom said, gesturing for Saldo 
to control himself. Saldo obviously 
was in no condition to risk physical 
contact with Janvert. There would 
be another killing. 



“You’re damned right it won’t be 
necessary,” Janvert said. He put a 
hand into the bulging pocket of his 
jacket, moved another two paces 
away from Saldo. “Don’t even 
try it, baby, or I’ll fix you 
permanently.” 

“Here! Here!” Hellstrom snap- 
ped. “That’s quite enough of that!” 
He looked squarely at Saldo. 
“What you can do, Saldo, is try to 
get a call through to Deputy Kraft. 
If what Mr. Janvert says is true, I 
don’t understand why Kraft is not 
here already. See if you can contact 
him and ask him to — ” 

“Kraft is very busy on a 
telephone call from his Lakeview 
office,” Janvert said. “Your tame 
deputy is occupied, understand? 
Nobody is going to come here and 
rescue you or interfere in any way 
before the arrival of the FBI.” 

Hellstrom saw a tight smile ap- 
pear on Jan vert’s face, realized 
abruptly that the Outsider was 
playing some kind of calculated 
game. Did Janvert actually possess 
police authority? Was it possible he 
was trying to provoke an incident 
that would allow him to take charge 
here until the others arrived? There 
were many things that had to be 
done to protect the Hive before the 
arrival of Outsider police. Would 
Janvert try to stop anyone from 
leaving this room? 

“Saldo,” Hellstrom said, “as la- 
mentable as this situation is we still 
have deadlines to meet, work to do. 
Delays are costly.” Hellstrom sig- 
naled for Saldo to leave, get about 
sealing up the Hive against an all- 
out investigation. “I suggest you 
get about that work,” Hellstrom 
said. “We’ll wait here with — ” 



16 



GALAXY 




“Nobody leaves,” Janvert snap- 
ped. He took another step away 
from Saldo. “This is a murder 
investigation. If you think you can 
cover — ” 

“l think if this turns out to be 
anything at all it will be 
considerably less than a murder 
investigation,” Hellstrom said. He 
signaled urgently for Saldo to 
leave. “I know for a fact that Fancy 
did not leave the farm last night. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Saldo is vitally im- 
portant to the film we’re making. 
That film represents an investment 
of several hundred thousand dollars 
already and it’s due in Hollywood 
in little more than a month. He ob- 
viously has taken time off from his 
work to greet you and escort you 
to—” 

“1 was taking a walk after the 
lunch break,” Saldo said, picking 
up his cue. He glanced at his 
wristwatch. “My God — I’m late! 
Ed will be clawing the wall!” He 
whirled, strode briskly toward the 
hall and the outer door. 

“Just a minute, you — ” Janvert 
shouted. 

Saldo ignored him. Hellstrom’s 
command in Hive-sign had been ex- 
plicit and brooked no disobedience. 
Janvert obviously carried a 
weapon, but the situation was 
desperate. Would he use it? Saldo 
continued unswerving toward the 
door. The Hive required this of 
him. 

“I’m telling you to stop or else!” 
Janvert yelled. He moved to the 
archway into the hall, tried to keep 
his attention on Saldo’s retreating 
back and the pair in the living room 
at the same time. Saldo had the 
door open. He was going out.

The door closed, 

“Mr. Janvert,” Hellstrom said. 
Janvert turned, glared at 
Hellstrom. 

“Mr. Janvert,” Hellstrom re- 
peated, his tone reasonable, “as 
difficult as this situation is, I 
would appreciate our not adding to 
its complications. We were 
expecting Mr. Peruge for luncheon 
and it would be a shame to waste 
that food. I’m sure all of our 
tempers would improve it we — ” 
“You think I’d eat anything 
here?” Janvert asked. 

Hellstrom shrugged. “Ap- 
parently we must wait for the law to 
arrive and you do not want Fancy 
or me to leave your presence. I am 
proposing a reasonable solution to 
the waiting period. I’m sure there’s 
a simple answer to these disturbing 
matters and I am only trying to — ” 
“Sure you are. And you like 
me!” 

“No, Mr. Janvert, I don’t par- 
ticularly care for you. And I’m sure 
Fancy shares my aversion. My 
concern simply goes to — ” 

“Will you knock off this innocent 
act?” 

J ANVERT felt himself seething 
with rage and frustration. He 
should not have let that other 
character get out of here. He should 
have shot at the guy’s legs, brought 
him down. 

“If you’re worried about our 
food, Mr. Janvert,” Mimeca said, 
“I’d be only too happy to taste 
everything before you eat it.” She 
glanced worriedly at Hellstrom. 
Nils had said he counted on the 
visitor’s eating their food — but this 
was a different visitor. 



“Taste my—” Janvert shook his 
head from side to side. 

Mimeca glanced at Hellstrom, 
seeking a sign of what to do. 

“She’s only trying to make you 
comfortable,” Hellstrom explained 
and, using Hive-sign, told Mimeca: 
Get hint to eat with us! He watched 
Janvert carefully. That had been 
close with Saldo. Janvert had al- 
most used that weapon in his 
pocket. Were these Outsiders really 
that desperate? 

“We’ve already had our sample 
of how Miss Fancy makes men 
comfortable,” Janvert responded. 
“Thanks, but no thanks.” 

“Well, I am going to eat my 
lunch,” Hellstrom said. “You may 
join us or not as you prefer.” He 
crossed to Mimeca, took her arm. 
“Come along, my dear. We’ve done 
our best.” 

Janvert had no choice except to 
follow them into the dining room. 
He noted the four places set at the 
table there, wondered whom the 
fourth place signified? Kraft? 
Saldo? 

Hellstrom seated Mimeca with 
her back to the china cabinet, took 
the chair at the head of the table 
with his back to the kitchen door. 
He indicated the chair opposite Mi- 
meca for Janvert. 

“At least, you can sit down with 
us.” 

Janvert ignored the invitation, 
strode deliberately around the table 
and took the chair beside Mimeca. 

“Wherever you wish,” Hellstrom 
said. 

Janvert glanced at the woman. 
She sat with hands folded in her 
lap, looking down at her plate al- 
most in an attitude of prayer. Look

as innocent as you want, honey! 
Janvert thought. We have you right 
where we want you. And if you try 
to sneak off the way your friend did 
[ really will shoot. We'll worry 
about consequences later. I might 
not even aim for your legs. 

“We’re having baked pork 
chops,” Hellstrom said. “Are you 
sure I can’t order a serving for 
you?” 

“Not on your sweet life or mine,” 
Janvert said. “Especially mine.” 
He glanced up alertly, tension ap- 
pearing in his gun arm, as the 
kitchen door creaked open. An 
older, gray-haired woman with 
dark olive skin and startlingly 
bright blue eyes came through the 
door. Her heavily wrinkled face 
creased into a smile as she peered 
questioningly at Hellstrom. Janvert 
jerked his attention to Hellstrom, 
caught a strange flicker-fingered 
gesture from the man, obviously 
directed at the older woman. At the 
same time a message-loaded look 
passed between Hellstrom and the 
younger woman seated beside him. 

“What are you doing there?” 
Janvert demanded. 

Hellstrom noted Jan vert’s at- 
tention on the hand signal, looked 
up at the ceiling with a weary 
expression. Janvert was going to be 
very difficult unless they got him to 
eat. There were so many things that 
needed doing and Saldo was too 
young to be trusted with all of 
them. He had older advisers to 
consult, but a headstrong character 
was developing in Saldo, one 
Hellstrom knew he had to curb. 
Saldo might not consult the backup 
brains in the Hive. 

“I asked you a question,” Janvert 



pressed, leaning toward Hellstrom. 

“I was trying to enlist my 
associates in helping me to calm 
you down and get you to join us for 
luncheon,” Hellstrom said, his 
voice weary. Would Janvert buy 
that? 

“Fat chance,” Janvert said. He 
looked back at the older woman. 
She still stood expectantly behind 
Hellstrom, one hand holding the 
kitchen door open. Why didn’t the 
old bitch say something? Was she 
just going to wait there until 
someone told her what to do? Ap- 
parently that was just what she was 
going to do. 

A long silence dragged out while 
the odd tableau continued. 

Have I judged him correctly? 
Hellstrom wondered. Should / 
signal for the serving to go ahead as 
ordered? 

What the hell are they waiting 
for? Janvert wondered. He recalled 
a reference by Peruge to “silent 
women.” The excuse had been that 
they were studying a difficult ac- 
cent. The old bitch did not look like 
an actress, though. Her eyes re- 
mained bright and alert, but there 
was pure patience in the set of her 
shoulders, the way she held the 
swinging door open. 

We must risk it, Hellstrom 
thought. 

He broke the silence then. “Mrs. 
Niles, would you bring us two ser- 
vings, please, just for Fancy and 
me. Mr. Janvert is not eating.” At 
the same time, masking the action 
by scratching his head, Hellstrom 
signaled for her to proceed. The 
words would be nonsense sounds to 
“Mrs. Niles,” who was a non- 
fertile worker trained specially for 



PROJECT 40 



19 




this job. She read his hand signs, 
however, nodded and retreated into 
the kitchen. 

J ANVERT grew aware of appe- 
tizing smells from the kitchen, 
began to wonder if he had acted 
foolishly. Would these people dare 
try to poison him here? They were 
weirdos, certainly, but — Yes, they 
might try to poison him. The elabo- 
rate luncheon confused him, 
though. Hellstrom surely must have 
known about Peruge’s death. Who 
else could have ordered that? 
Whom had they been expecting for 
this meal, then — or had they pre- 
pared this luncheon as an elaborate 
sham? That might mean they had 
prepared nothing but straightfor- 
ward, wholesome food. 

He loved pork chops. 

Hellstrom was staring calmly out 
the window at the other end of the 
table, his manner casual, un- 
concerned. “You know, Fancy, I 
always like it when we eat here. We 
should do this more often — instead 
of grabbing a quick lunch on the 
set.” 

“Or missing lunch entirely,” she 
said. “Oh, I’ve noticed how you do 
sometimes.” 

He patted his stomach. “Doesn’t 
hurt to miss an occasional meal. I 
tend to fat anyway.” 

“I’m going to remind you about 
this,” she said. “You’re going to 
ruin your stomach if you go on the 
way you’ve been.” 

“We have been busy,” Hellstrom 
said. 

They were nuts, Janvert thought. 
Chatting, making small talk at a 
time like this. 

Mrs. Niles backed through the 



swinging door, turned to reveal a 
plate in each hand. She hesitated a 
moment beside Hellstrom, then 
served the young woman First. 
When both plates were on the table 
Hellstrom signaled for her to bring 
the drinks. He had ordered vat- 
beer. The Hive made a limited 
amount of it as a reward for supe- 
rior work and as a mask to convey 
some of the adjustment chemicals 
occasionally required for reject-spe- 
cialists who were being sent back to 
dronedorn. 

Janvert glanced at the plate in 
front of the woman beside him. 
Steam was rising from it. The pork 
had been covered with gravy in 
which large mushrooms could be 
seen. Spinach and baked potato 
had been served beside the meat 
course and a stiff, white serving of 
sour cream had been spooned onto 
the potato. The young woman just 
sat there, though, hands still folded, 
eyes downcast. Was she praying, 
for Christ’s sake? 

Hellstrom startled him then by 
placing both hands folded together 
over his own plate and intoning: 
“Dear Lord, for this food we are 
about to eat we give our true and 
heartfelt thanks. May thy divine 
grace visit us in this sharing of the 
substance of life. Amen.” 

The young woman joined him in 
the: “Amen.” 

The wealth of feeling in 
Hellstrom’s voice confused Janvert. 
And this dame, they way she joined 
him at the end. They must do this 
regularly. The ritual shook Janvert 
more than he liked to admit even to 
himself — and he responded with 
anger. More of their damned 
acting!

The aroma from the plate beside 
Janvert added to his frustration. 
She was reaching for her fork, too. 
They were going right ahead with 
the damned meal. 

“Are you sure we cannot serve 
you anything?” Hellstrom asked. 

In sudden angry glee Janvert 
reached past the young woman, 
took Hellstrom’s plate and said, 
“Certainly. Glad you asked.” He 
placed the plate triumphantly in 
front of him, taking special delight 
in the way the captured dish clinked 
against the service plate. Janvert 
thought, There won’t be anything 
wrong with the food Hellstrom was 
going to eat! 

Hellstrom threw his head back 
and laughed, unable to restrain 
himself. He felt that the Hive sud- 
denly had come into a new vitality, 
that it was being expressed in his 



own person and was helping him do 
battle. 

S MILING, Mimeca peered up 
through her long lashes at 
Hellstrom. Janvert was predictable, 
but Outsiders often were. He had 
behaved precisely as Hellstrom had 
signaled he would. She had har- 
bored doubts when Hellstrom had 
flashed the plan in Hive-sign. 
Janvert had the loaded serving in 
front of him, though, and was 
picking up knife and fork to eat it. 
He would be docile enough pretty 
soon. 

Hellstrom wiped laughter tears 
from his eyes with a corner of his 
napkin, called out to the kitchen 
door, “Mrs. Niles! Bring another 
serving.” 

The door opened and the older 
woman peered around its edge.

Hellstrom pointed to the empty 
place in front of him, signaled for 
another serving. She nodded, 
ducked into the kitchen and reap- 
peared almost immediately with 
another heaping plate. Probably 
her own, Hellstrom thought. He 
hoped there was more. The 
neutered workers had such en- 
joyment from an occasional break 
in the common fare of vat gruel. 
Idly he wondered where these chops 
had come from — probably that 
young worker who had been killed 
in the generator room last night. 
They looked tender. He thought as 
he picked up his knife and fork. 
Bless this one who joins the eternal 
flow of life, becoming part of all. 

The meat not only was tender, it 
was juicy. Janvert was displaying 
obvious relish. 

“Eat hearty,” Hellstrom said, 
gesturing with a fork. “We serve 
nothing but the very finest food 
here and Mrs. Niles is a superb 
cook.” 

She was, too, Hellstrom re- 
minded himself as he took another 
savory bite. He hoped again that 
she had saved at least one serving 
for herself. She deserved a reward. 

XXIII 

The words of Trova Hellstrom: 
The model of the Hive’s 
insertion into those patterns of 
other life around us is that of 
the tesseract, a cube projected 
into four dimensions. Our 
tesseract is built of mosaic 
parts which cannot be 
detached, whose boundaries 
blend one into another with 
indissoluble flow. In this way 



this model gives us a habitat 
and a timeline remarkably self- 
contained, but merging into the 
larger system of the planet and 
the universe beyond. Re- 
member always that our 
tesseract merges with other sys- 
tems — and it does this in such 
diverse and complex ways that 
we cannot remain concealed in- 
definitely. Thus we consider the 
physical dimensions of our 
Hive as a habitat for only a 
particular stage of our 
development. We will outgrow 
this stage. It is of the utmost 
concern for the managing spe- 
cialists of the Hive, therefore, 
that we not restrict our genetic 
lines of adaptability. We are 
aimed at other times as well as 
other habitats. 

<‘ # T , HAT sounded like an 
X interesting conversation, 
what I could hear on this end,” 
Clovis Carr said. 

Lincoln Kraft stared across his 
big fiat-top desk at her. He could 
see a corner of Steens Mountain 
through the window behind her 
head. The sounds of afternoon 
shopping were just beginning to 
pick up in the big commercial com- 
plex one floor down. A poster on 
the wall to his left gave detailed 
recommendations on how to 
prevent rustling. Random patrol of 
fences was the third item down and 
his gaze kept returning to that 
number, seeking some magic in it. 
It was almost three p.m. He had 
received three telephone calls from 
the office in Lakeview thus far and 
each time had been told to “sit 
tight.”

GALAXY 




Clovis Carr squirmed her tiny, 
wiry body into a more comfortable 
position on the hard wooden seat of 
her chair. She was a brunette with a 
deceptively young face that tended 
to set into harsh, aging lines when 
she relaxed. She had been with 
Kraft since shortly before 11:00 
a.m. — first at the motel where Pe- 
ruge’s death had been reported by a 
tough-looking runt of a man who 
had identified himself to Kraft only 
as “Janvert.” Kraft had understood 
almost immediately that Janvert 
and this Clovis Carr were 
associates and the pieces had begun 
to fall into place from there. The 
pair belonged to Peruge’s team. 
Kraft had played his hand carefully 
from that point — these two were 
suspicious of him. he soon realized. 
The female stuck to him like a burr 
on a bear. 

That third call from Sheriff 
Lapham in Lakeview had been part 
of a pattern that had Kraft more 
nervous than he had been since the 
summer the Hive had picked up a 
runaway toddler and an entire 
family had fanned out over the 
range around the farm, hunting the 
lost child. That one had been turned 
off by a quickly hatched story that 
a child of the exact description had 
been seen being picked up by a 
couple in an old car only a block 
away from the place where the tod- 
dler last had been seen. 

Lapham’s orders in his final call 
had been explicit. “You wait in 
your office until the FBI gets there, 
you hear, Line? This is a job for 
very delicate professional handling. 
Take my word on it.” 

Kraft had been at a loss how to 
respond to this. He could act 



professionally insulted (and leave a 
political scar the sheriff would 
never forget) — or he could obey like 
a tame public servant. He could act 
dumb and western hick for this 
dame — or knowledgeable and so- 
phisticated. He didn’t know which 
response would give him the best 
leverage to probe and seek a clue 
to help the Hive. One way these 
Outsiders might mistakenly un- 
derestimate him. He rather doubted 
this was possible now. Another way 
he might gain valuable insights 
from what they did not do. 

Such as not leaving him alone. 

Kraft’s long conditioning to 
protect the Hive at all costs left him 
irritated and frustrated now. All his 
fears were sharpened by the sense 
of danger, but the need to maintain 
his cover dominated every response 
that occurred to him. In the end he 
did nothing except obey Sheriff 
Lapham — sit here like a lump 
waiting for the FBI. 

The Carr female annoyed him. 
As long as she stayed there, 
watching, listening, he could not 
call Hellstrom. She knew he was 
nervous, too, and seemed to enjoy 
it. As though he couldn’t see how 
phony she was. Vacationer? That 
one? 

She had an oval face with skin 
badly sunburned, a hard and direct 
stare from cold gray eyes, a firm 
jaw and a thin, unsmiling mouth. 
He suspected she was carrying a 
pistol in that big black canvas 
handbag in her lap. Something 
about her was faintly reminiscent of 
the models on TV commercials — a 
controlled and purposeful way of 
moving, a remoteness of manner no 
amount of surface glibness could 



PROJECT 40 



23 




conceal. She was one of those tiny 
women who would be skinny and 
energetic until the day they died. 
She was all fitted out for her 
western vacation — dungaree slacks, 
matching blouse and brass-button 
jacket. The clothes still had a sheen 
of newness about them and looked 
as though they had been picked by a 
wardrobe mistress according to a 
script adviser’s list. They didn’t suit 
her style. The blue bandanna over 
her long black hair was the final un- 
likely touch. Her left hand held that 
black canvas purse in the casual- 
but-ready manner of a police- 
woman. Every time he looked at 
the purse Kraft felt more certain 
she carried a gun in it. Although she 
had avoided showing Kraft her cre- 
dentials, Sheriff Lapham had 
known her name on his first call 
and had treated it with the kind of 
deference that spoke of official 
clout — and highly potent clout at 
that. 

Kraft had just hung up on 
Lapham’s third call. 

“That was the sheriff again, 
wasn’t it?” she asked after a while 
nodding at the telephone on the 
desk. 



H ER voice carried an un- 
concealed note of scorn, 
Clovis knew, but she had decided 
not to worry about effects. She did 
not like this thick-nosed, beetle- 
browed deputy and the dislike went 
deeper than her suspicions about 
his involvement in the deaths of her 
fellow agents. He was western and 
he showed an evident liking for out- 
door life. Those two items alone 
would have done it. She preferred 



the nightclub circuit, just as Eddie 
Janvert did, and this was a damned 
hick assignment. The skin of her 
cheeks and nose felt tight and 
painful from sunburn, confirming 
her irritation. 

“It was the sheriff,” Kraft admit- 
ted. Why deny it? His answers had 
signaled the questions and those 
questions could have originated 
only with the sheriff. 

No, sir. The FBI hasn’t shown up 
yet. 

Yes, sir — / haven't been out of 
this here office. 

Clovis Carr sniffed. “What have 
they found out about Peruge’s 
murder? Anything yet on the 
autopsy?” 

Kraft studied her for a moment. 
One closing item from the sheriff 
had to be weighed carefully. When 
the special agent in charge of the 
FBI team arrived the sheriff wanted 
Kraft to relay a message. The 
message sounded simple enough. 
The U S. Attorney still was not 
ready to deliver a firm opinion “on 
the legal basis for intervention.” 
Kraft was to tell the FBI, however, 
that the agents could proceed on the 
“presumptive assumption” that 
Hellstrom’s activities in interstate 
commerce would provide such a 
basis. According to the sheriff the 
FBI was due at Fosterville any 
minute and Lapham wanted to 
know the minute they arrived. 
Rented cars had been sent to the 
airport and “Janvert’s people” 
were there to give a briefing. 

Kraft had written “presumptive 
assumption” on the notepad beside 
the telephone. He wondered now if 
it would lull suspicions if he shared 
this message with the Carr female. 



24 



GALAXY 




He knew he would have to deliver it 
intact to the FBI, but that was 
another matter. Could any ad- 
vantage be gained from it now? 

“They haven’t reported on the 
autopsy yet,” Kraft said. 

"You have written'presumptive 
assumption’ on your notepad," she 
said. “Is that about the U.S. At- 
torney’s opinion?” 

Kraft came to a negative decision 
about Carr, said, “I’d better let the 
FBI discuss that with you. Say, you 
never did tell me what your con- 
nection with this is.” 

“No, I didn’t, did I?” she said. 
“You’re a very careful man, Mr. 
Kraft, aren’t you?” 

He nodded. “Yes.” 

What did that mean? 

A malicious smile twitched the 
corners of her mouth. “And you 
don’t like to be kept on the bench 
here.” 

“I don’t like it,” he agreed. He 
wondered at her almost open 
hostility toward him. Was it calcu- 
lated provocation or did it reflect 
something even more disastrous — a 
high-up decision to distrust the 
local deputy? He guessed at the lat- 
ter, wondered how to deal with it. 
Hellstrom and the Security Council 
had discussed with him contingency 
plans for such a problem, but no 
one had assumed a situation as 
complex as this one. 

C LOVIS glanced over her 
shoulder through the window 
behind her chair. The office was hot 
and the hard wooden seat of the 
chair irritated her. She longed for 
an iced drink and a cool, shadowy 
lounge bar with soft chairs, Janvert 
beside her warm and admiring. She 



had been playing the part of 
Janvert’s sister on this stupid 
western vacation for a week now. 
That mask had come off with the 
discovery of Peruge’s death. The 
cover relationship had been touchy 
at times. Janvert had not gone out 
of his way to keep things smooth 
with Nick Myerlie, who had 
fronted as their father. And DT had 
poked his nose in every time she 
and Janvert turned around. Spying 
for the brass — no doubt of it. DT 
was so damned obvious it was 
ridiculous. Tight quarters in the 
damned van and an investigation 
whose pattern none of them liked 
had worn on all of them. There had 
been times when they had chosen 
not to speak rather than risk a 
fight. All that stored-up temper was 
coming out in her now with Kraft 
as its focus. She realized this, but 
didn’t care to suppress it. 

Housewives doing their afternoon 
shopping were beginning to fill the 
parking lot below the window with 
their cars. Clovis scanned the cars, 
hoping to see the FBI team emerge 
from one of them. Nothing. She 
returned her attention to Kraft. 

/ could tell this stupid deputy that 
we’re prepared to put him six feet 
under in the most direct and sani- 
tary way . This was a fantasy 
game she liked to play about people 
she disliked. Kraft would be 
shocked and alarmed, of course. He 
already showed signs of the 
twitches. Nobody was going to 
blast this son of a bitch, of course. 
Hardly likely. But Kraft was in 
trouble. The Chief had pulled 
strings in Washington and these 
had reached out through the State 
Capitol to the sheriff in Lakeview. 



PROJECT 40 



25 




It was like a marionette system. 
Potent federal power was breathing 
down Kraft’s collar and he could 
feel it. He still wanted to see her 
identification, but he hadn’t asked 
straight out to see it in more than 
an hour. Lucky, too — she had only 
her cover identification and ac- 
cording to it she was Clovis Myerlie 
and she had already been in- 
troduced as Clovis Carr. 

“This has been a very unusual 
way to handle a missing-persons 
case,” she said, swinging around to 
stare at the poster on the side wall. 
Cattle rustling, yet, and how to 
prevent same! 

“An even more unusual way to 
handle an unexplained death in a 
motel,” Kraft said. 

“Murder case,” she corrected 
him. 

“I haven’t seen that tied down 
yet,” he said. 

“You will.” 

He kept his gaze on Carr’s 
sunburned face. They both knew 
that nothing about this case was 
usual. The sheriffs words still ran- 
kled in Kraft’s memory. Line, we 
are just the country cousins in this 
case as of now. The governor 
himself is in this act’ This is not 
routine, got that? Not routine. We 
will straighten this out between us 
later, but right now, / want you to 
lay doggo and let the FBI run the 
whole show. They can fight it out 
with the Alcohol Tax boys on who 
has jurisdiction, but our jurisdiction 
stops at the edge of the governor’s 
desk, got me? Don’t tell me we have 
rights and responsibilities. I know 
’em as well as you do. Neither of us 
is going to mention them. Is that all 
clear? 



It had been very clear. 

“Where did you get that 
sunburn?” Kraft asked, staring at 
Carr’s face. 

Sitting out in your goddamned 
western sunshine with a pair of bi- 
noculars, you son of a bitch! You 
know where I got it. She shrugged 
and kept her voice nonchalant. 
“Oh, just hiking around your lovely 
countryside.” 

Hiking around the Hive, Kraft 
thought with a pang of deep dis- 
quiet. He said: “None of this might 
have happened if your Mr. Peruge 
had gone through normal channels. 
He should have gone to the sheriff 
over in Lakeview first instead of 
coming to me or even to the state 
people. Sheriff Lapham’s a 
good — ” 

“A good politician,” she inter- 
rupted. “We thought we’d rather 
deal directly with someone who 
enjoyed a closer relationship with 
Dr. Hellstrom.” 

Kraft licked his lips, his mouth 
suddenly dry. He held himself 
watchfully alert for any more 
revelations that touched on their 
suspicions. He didn’t like the way 
Carr cocked her head to one side to 
return his gaze. 

“I don’t understand,” he said. 
“What have I to — ” 

“You understand,” she said. 

“Damned if I do!” 

“And damned if you don’t,” she 
said. 

Kraft felt himself caught by the 
unleashed power behind her 
hostility. She was deliberately 
trying to provoke him. She really 
didn’t care how she treated him. He 
blurted, “Oh, I know what you are, 
all right. You’re from one of those 



26 



GALAXY 




secret government agencies. CIA, 
I’ll bet. You think you own the—” 
“Thanks for the promotion,” she 
said, but she bent a more watchful 
gaze upon him. The conversation 
had taken an awkward turn she did 
not like at all. Eddie had said the 
Chief wanted them to press the 
deputy, but not to frighten him off. 

Kraft fidgeted in his chair. A 
painful silence settled over the 
room, deep and charged. He started 
casting around for excuses to get 
away to a telephone. He could 
excuse himself to go to the toilet, 
but this female would make sure he 
went to the toilet and there was no 
telephone there. The desire to call 
Hellstrom was losing its appeal, 
too. It could be dangerous to call 
Hellstrom. Every line to the farm 
might carry a tap by now. What 
had caused them to link him with 
Hellstrom? There had been times 
he had been taken sick on Outsider 
foods and been nursed back to 
health at the Hive. The cover was 
that he had been a great good friend 
of old Trova (true) but she was long 
dead and in the vats. Why should 
that make these government people 
suspicious? 

His mind went on this way for a 
time, following the trail of its own 
fears, worrying out bits of the past 
to wonder about. Was that suspi- 
cious, or what about this event, or 
the time he had . 

T HE ringing of the telephone 
startled him out of this nervous 
reverie. He grabbed for the phone, 
knocked it from its cradle, had to 
recover it from a dangling position 
beside the desk. The voice on the 
line was anxious and loud when he 



finally got the receiver to his ear. 
“Hello? Hello?” 

“This is Deputy Kraft,” he said. 
“Is Clovis Carr there? They said 
she’d be there.” 

“She’s here. Who is this?” 

“Just put her on the line.” 

“This is an official phone and 
I’d—” 

“Goddamn it, this is an official 
call. You put her on this line.” 

“Yes, well — ” 

“Do it now!” There was no 
mistaking the long history of ex- 
pected obedience behind that 
barked command. Kraft felt the 
power in the voice as an almost pal- 
pable thing. He handed the phone 
across the desk to Carr. “It’s for 
you.” 

She took the phone from him 
with a puzzled frown, spoke into it. 
“Yes?” 

“Clovis?” 

She recognized that voice — the 
Chief himself. For the love of all 
that was holy, the Chief himself was 
calling here! 

“Clovis here,” she said, her 
mouth dry. 

“Do you know who this is?” 
“Yes.” 

“I have you identified from a 
voiceprint being played this instant. 
I want you to listen very carefully 
and do exactly what I tell you to 
do.” 

“Yes, sir. What is it?” Something 
in the tone told her it was big 
trouble. 

“Can that deputy hear this?” the 
Chief asked. 

“I doubt it.” 

“We’ll have to chance it. Now get 
this: that light aircraft with the FBI 
men and the Alcohol Tax team 



PROJECT 40 



27 




crashed somewhere in the Sisters. 
That’s a mountain north of you. All 
dead. It could have been an acci- 
dent, but we are acting on the 
assumption that it was not. I’ve just 
been on to the director, and he is 
taking the same position, especially 
in view of what 1 could tell him 
about the situation over the 
telephone. A new FBI team is on its 
way from Seattle, but it will be 
some time before they arrive.” 

She gulped, glanced worriedly at 
Kraft. The deputy was leaning 
back, hands behind his head, 
staring at the ceiling. 

“What do you want me to do?” 
she asked. 

“I’ve been in radio contact with 
the other members of your team, all 
except Janvert. Is he still at that 
farm?” 

“As far as I know, sir.” 

“All right— no help for that. It 
might even be a plus. The others are 
coming down from the mountain to 
pick you up. You are to take the 
deputy with you. Use force if 
necessary. Take him with you, got 
that?” 

“I’ve got it.” Her exploring fin- 
gers felt the outline of the revolver 
in her purse. She slipped her hand 
into the bag, took a firm grip on the 
gun. Involuntarily her glance went 
to the big pistol in a holster at 
Kraft’s waist. 

“I’ve instructed DT on what I 
want done,” the Chief said. “You 
are to move onto that farm and 
take over there, subdue any op- 
position. The director concurs. 
Responsibility will be ours, 
however. We have been promised 
extraordinary cooperation by the 
FBI. Do you understand?” 



“I understand.” , 

“I hope you do. You are not to 
take chances. You are to kill that 
deputy if he interferes. And 
anyone else who tries to block you. 
We will work out a sufficient justifi- 
cation for this later. I want that 
farm in our hands within the hour.” 
“Yes, sir. Is DT to be in charge.” 
“No. Until you get to the farm, 
you are in charge.” 

“Me?” 

“You. When you contact Janvert 
he is to take over.” 

Her mouth was dry as dust. God! 
She needed a drink and comforting, 
but she sensed why the Chief was 
putting her in charge until they 
reached Eddie. The Chief knew 
about her and Eddie. The Chief had 
a snake’s mind. He’d say to 
himself: She's the one with the best 
motivation. She'll want to rescue 
her boy friend. G ive her the reins ... 

She sensed something else might 
be on the Chiefs mind, but she 
didn’t know how to ask. Was it 
something to do with Kraft? She 
pressed the phone tightly against 
her ear, pushed her chair back 
toward the window. 

“Is that all?” she asked. 

“No, you’d better know the 
worst. We stumbled onto some- 
thing while talking to the sheriff. 
He gave it to us himself, very casual 
and unconcerned. It seems your 
deputy, whenever he gets sick, is in 
the habit of convalescing at 
Hellstrom’s farm. In our hunt for 
Hellstrom’s Washington connec- 
tions, we found a Congressman 
about whom we can say the same 
thing — and we have our suspicions 
about at least one Senator. Got 
that?” 



28 



GALAXY 




She nodded. “I see.” 

“I think you do. This thing 
spreads wider every time you pry up 
another layer. Take no chances 
with that deputy whatsoever.” 

“I won’t,” she said. “How bad 
was it — I mean, at the Sisters?” 
“The plane burned. It was a twin 
Beech, chartered and recently 
checked out by the FAA. No 
reason for it to go down. We 
haven’t been able to examine the 
wreckage yet, but the fire gave it 
away — started a forest blaze on the 
east slope, they say. Forest service 
boys are there now — and local 
police, FAA. We’ll have a report as 
soon as possible.” 

“What a mess,” she said and 
noted that Kraft was staring at her 
intently now, trying to listen. “Is 
there any chance at all that it was 
an accident?” 

“Possible, but not likely. The 
pilot was former Air America from 
Vietnam, six thousand hours. Draw 
your own conclusions. Oh, tell 
Shorty he has Class G authoriza- 
tion. Do you know what that is?” 
“Yes — yes, sir.” My God! Kill 
and burn if necessary . 

“I’ll get back to you by radio 
after you’ve taken over that farm,” 
the Chief said. “Within the hour. 
Goodbye and be thorough.” 

She heard the receiver click, 
moved her chair across to the desk, 
replaced the phone in its cradle. 
Using the edge of the desk as a 
cover, she slipped her revolver from 
the purse. 

Kraft watched her, trying to 
piece together a version of that con- 
versation from the only end he’d 
heard. His First inkling that things 
had changed for the worse came 



when he saw the silencer of Clovis 
Carr’s pistol rise like a steel snake 
over the far edge of the desk. 

Clovis’s working personality was 
in full charge now and she put aside 
thoughts of Janvert’s arms around 
her or other desirable things. 

“Keep your hands where I can 
see them” she said. “I will kill you 
at the slightest provocation. Do not 
make any sudden movements for 
any reason. Get to your feet care- 
fully, keeping your hands on the 
desk. Use extreme caution in 
everything you do, Mr. Kraft. I 
don’t want to shoot you in this of- 
fice. It would be messy and difficult 
to explain. But I will do it if you 
force me.” 

XXIV 

From the preliminary oral 
report on the autopsy of Dzule 
Peruge : The bruised area on 
the arm gave indications of an 
inept injection with a hypo- 
dermic. We cannot say at this 
time what may have been in- 
jected, but the biopsies are not 
yet completed. Other indica- 
tions on the cadaver indicate 
what we call among ourselves a 
“motel death.” The syndrome 
is rather common with males 
past the age of thirty-five where 
death occurs under the circum- 
stances described here. The im- 
mediate cause of death was 
what you would call a massive 
“heart failure.” We’ll send 
along the technical details 
later. Whether this remains the 
proximate cause depends on 
the biopsies. From the other in- 
dications we can say the subject 



PROJECT 40 



29 




had engaged in sexual inter- 
course at a time very close to 
the time of death — perhaps no 
more than four hours earlier. 
Yes, that’s what we mean. It’s 
a very clear pattern: older man, 
younger woman (presumed 
from your account) and too 
much sex. All the evidence is 
consistent with this diagnosis. 

<«Tky| R . JANVERT, we have 
JXI some things to discuss,” 
Hellstrom said. He leaned toward 
Janvert across the table. 

Jan vert, having finished his 
lunch, sat with his right elbow on 
the table, chin resting on his hand. 
He felt lost in thought, bemused by 
the whole situation — the present 
company, the Agency, the call from 
the Chief, this assignment, his 
former fears. Vaguely he felt that 
he still ought to be alert and 
perhaps concerned about Hellstrom 
and the woman at table with them, 
but this did -not seem worth the ef- 
fort. 

“It’s time we discussed our 
mutual problems,” Hellstrom said. 

Janvert nodded on his supporting 
hand, chuckled as his chin started 
to slip from the hand. 

Discuss problems. Certainly . 

Something about this rustic farm 
setting, the excellent meal, some- 
thing about these people at table 
with him, somewhere in all this was 
good and sufficient reason for the 
transformed mood now upon him, 
Janvert told himself. He had fought 
long enough against liking 
Hellstrom. Perhaps it was still 
unwise to place complete trust in 
Hellstrom, but it was all right to 
like him. There was a difference 



between trust and liking. Hellstrom 
could not be held responsible for 
the trapped life of a nobody named 
Eddie Janvert. 

Watching the transformation, 
Hellstrom thought, He’s taking it 
quite well . The dosages were 
relatively large. Janvert’ s body was 
now processing numerous identifier 
chemicals. Very shortly he would 
be acceptable by any Hive worker 
as belonging to the Hive. The con- 
dition worked two ways — Janvert 
would respond with an acceptance 
of the Hive workers, too — any of 
them. His procreative drive had 
been suppressed, also much of his 
critical ability. If the chemical 
metamorphosis worked he would 
become quite tractable presently. 

Hellstrom signaled to Mimeca to 
observe the changes. 

She smiled. Janvert’s odors were 
becoming quite acceptable, she 
thought. 

It's this farm that’s reaching me, 
Janvert told himself. He moved 
only his eyes to stare through the 
window beyond the foot of the 
table. The golden afternoon ap- 
peared warm and inviting. He and 
Clovis had talked about such a 
place many times. Our own place, 
preferably an old farm. We’ll grow 
a few things, raise some animals. 
Our kids can help with that when 
they're old enough. It was a fantasy 
they sometimes shared before 
making love. The poignancy of the 
exotic and unattainable made the 
present ever more sweet. 

“Are you ready for a little dis- 
cussion?” Hellstrom asked. 

“Sure,” Janvert said. He sounded 
relatively alert, but Hellstrom de- 
tected the changes of tone.

GALAXY 




T HE subtle chemistry of fellow- 
ship was doing its work. It was 
a dangerous thing because Janvert 
might walk openly through any 
area of the Hive now. No worker 
would challenge him and haul him 
summarily off to the nearest vat 
point. But it meant also that 
Janvert would respond candidly to 
Hellstrom or any other Hive Se- 
curity interrogator. 

Provided this technique worked 
well on an Outsider. That remained 
to be tested. 

“Your law is a little late ar- 
riving,” Hellstrom said. “Shouldn’t 
you call and try to find out why?” 
Late? Janvert looked up at the 
clock behind Hellstrom. Almost 
2:00 p.m. Where had the time gone? 
He seemed to recall chatting with 
Hellstrom and the woman — Fancy 
was her name. Sweet little thing. 
But someone was late. 

“Are you sure you haven’t made 
a mistake about the FBI and the 
others?” Hellstrom asked. “Are 
they coming?” 

“I don’t think I’ve made a mis- 
take,” Janvert said. He sounded 
sad. The sadness brought a small 
surge of anger and adrenalin. No- 
body made mistakes in this 
business! God, what a lousy way to 
live. All because he’d stumbled over 
that damned Agency File. No — that 
had been only a single step. The 
trap was far more complex than 
that. 

Eddie Janvert had been condi- 
tioned to accept everything the 
Agency represented. That condi- 
tioning had happened much earlier. 
But without all this he might not 
have met Clovis. Lovely Clovis. 
Much prettier than this little Fancy 



person beside him. He felt that 
there ought to be other com- 
parisons to make between Clovis 
and Fancy, too, but these eluded 
him now. The Agency — Agency — 
Agency — Agency. It was a bad 
business. He could sense the leering 
presence of the hidden oligarchs 
whose influence could be felt all 
through the Agency. That was it — 
the Agency was bad business. 

“I was just thinking,” Hellstrom 
said, “that under other circum- 
stances we might have been very 
close friends.” 

Friends. Janvert nodded and his 
head almost slipped from his sup- 
porting hand. They were friends. 
This Hellstrom was really a very 
nice guy. He served a good meal. 
And it was sweet the way he said 
grace before eating. 

The idea of friendship with 
Hellstrom fanned a tiny core of 
worry in Janvert, though. He began 
to wonder about his reactions. Old 
Peruge had said something im- 
portant way back there somewhere. 
He’d said Hellstrom and friends 
had some kind of — some kind of — 
injection! That was it, an injection. 
It turned a man into a sex-mad 
stud, Peruge had said. Eighteen 
times in one night. Janvert smiled 
happily to himself. When you 
thought about it, that was really 
very friendly. It was much more 
friendly than the damned Agency 
where they watched like cats to find 
out whom you cared for — the way 
he and Clovis cared for each 
other — and then used that against 
you. That’s what the Agency did. 
Friendship with Hellstrom became 
an easily explained thing with a lit- 
tle reflection. The whole blasted 



PROJECT 40 



31 




Agency had finally become too 
much for one Eddie Janvert. Wait 
till he told Clovis about this. 
Eighteen times in one night — that 
was very friendly. 

Mimeca, taking her cue from 
Hellstrom, touched Janvert’s arm. 
She had a nice, friendly little hand. 
“I thought the same thing,” she 
said. “We really should be friends.” 

Janvert straightened jerkily, pat- 
ted her hand. That was the friendly 
thing to do. Again he wondered at 
himself. He felt that he could al- 
most trust this pair. Was that a 
natural thing? Well, why not? They 
couldn’t have put anything in his 
food. That was an odd thought, he 
told himself. He recalled taking 
Hellstrom’s plate. Yes. Hellstrom 
had relinquished his very own plate 
of good food. Now — that was 
friendly. You didn’t hide unfriendly 
things in plain actions. Did you? He 
stared at the woman beside him, 
wondering idly why his mind was 
working at such a crawling pace. 
Peruge! Something in his food was 
out of the question. No injection 
either. He continued to stare at the 
woman, wondering why he did so. 
Sex? He was not lusting after this 
pneumatic little woman with the 
friendly hands and melting eyes. 
Maybe Peruge had been wrong. 
Had Peruge lied? The unfriendly 
bastard was capable of it. 

There could be perfectly natural 
explanations for this whole thing, 
Janvert told himself. What could he 
possibly have against Hellstrom — 
except what the Agency’s position 
here dictated. And he didn’t even 
know what that was! Project 40. 
Yes — something about papers. 

Project 40. But that was 



Hellstrom’s project. It must be 
friendly. It wasn’t like the damned 
Agency. 

Janvert felt a sudden need to 
move around. He pushed back his 
chair, almost fell over backward, 
but the pretty woman helped him 
recover his balance. He patted her 
hand. Windows. He wanted to look 
out. Weaving very little, Janvert 
guided himself down the length of 
the table to the bay windows at the 
end. A short stretch of water with 
no visible flow could be seen in the 
creekbed. The faint afternoon 
breeze swayed the tree shadows on 
the water and provided an illusion 
of movement. The silence in the 
dining room behind him carried a 
similar illusion. Casually he won- 
dered how his senses reported 
reality. It was a very friendly scene, 
friendly place. 

There was movement. 

Why did he have this little nig- 
gling worry way down inside? That 
was the only irritating thing left in 
this whole situation. 

Situation. What situation? 

Janvert shook his head from side 
to side like a wounded animal. 
Everything was so damned con- 
fusing. 

S ITTING back in his chair, 
Hellstrom frowned. Hive 
chemistry was not working on 
Janvert in quite the way it would 
have on one of their own. Hive hu- 
mans remained close enough 
genetically to the Outsiders for in- 
terbreeding. The divergence was 
only about three hundred years old. 
Chemical affinity was not 
surprising. It was to be expected, in 
fact. But Janvert was not 



32 



GALAXY 




responding with full and open 
friendliness. It was as though he 
were fighting a deep inner battle. 
Chemistry was not enough, then. 
That was to be expected, too. The 
human was much more than flesh. 
Some holdout element in Janvert’s 
intellect retained a concept of 
Hellstrom as threat. 

Mimeca had followed Janvert to 
the window, stood now just behind 
him. “We really mean you no 
harm,” she murmured. 

He nodded. Of course they meant 
him no harm. What a thought. 
Janvert put a hand in his jacket 
pocket, felt the gun there. He 
recognized it. A gun was an un- 
friendly thing. 

“Why can’t we be friends?” Mi- 
meca asked. 

Tears began to flow from 
Janvert’s eyes, roll slowly down his 
cheeks. It was so sad. The gun, this 
place, Clovis, the Agency, Peruge, 
everything. So sad. He pulled the 
gun from his pocket, turned to re- 
veal his tear-stained face, handed 
the gun to Mimeca. She accepted it, 
held it awkwardly — one of those 
awful flesh-destroying Outsider 
weapons. 

“Throw it away,” Janvert whis- 
pered. “Please, throw that damned 
thing away.” 

From a news story, 
Washington, DC., dateline: 
. .and it was noted that 
Altman’s death was not the 
first such suicide of a highly 
placed government official. 
Washington observers im- 
mediately recalled the death on 
May 22, 1949, of Defense Sec- 
retary James Forrestal, who 



shocked family and associates 
by leaping from a hospital 
window. 

Altman’s death also revived 
the recurrent Washington 
rumor that he was in fact the 
chief of a secret and highly 
sensitive investigative agency 
operating under the govern- 
ment’s executive arm. One of 
Altman’s senior associates, 
Joseph Merrivale, issued an 
angry denial of the rumor, de- 
manding, “Is that bloody gab- 
ble still going around?” 

ALL in all, it had been a highly 
il successful afternoon in spite 
of the earlier alarms, Hellstrom 
told himself. He stood in the barn 
aerie, staring out the louvered win- 
dows to the north. Vehicles were 
stirring up dust in the distance, but 
he felt no threat from the Outsiders 
at the moment. Reports from 
Washington and the nearby town 
indicated an easing of pressure. 

Janvert had answered all their 
questions with only the most gentle 
form of persuasion. It saddened 
Hellstrom to think about this, com- 
paring it with their previous proce- 
dure. So much pain could have been 
spared the other captives. When 
you thought about it, this technique 
was so obvious. Fancy had done the 
Hive a truly great service. 

Saldo walked to Hellstrom with 
cat-footed grace, said, “Station Six 
says that dust out there is three 
heavy vehicles approaching our 
lower road.” 

“I think J^nvert’s law is almost 
here,” Hellstrom said. “Are we 
ready for them?” 

“As ready as we can be. Mimeca

is down in the farmhouse prepared 
to play Fancy to the hilt. Injured in- 
nocence, the whole thing. She’s 
never even heard of Depeaux, the 
Agency, a bicycle — nothing.” 

“Good. Where did you put 
Jan vert?” 

“In an empty cell on Level Forty- 
two. Everything is on Emergency 
Alert.” 

With renewed misgivings Hell- 
strom thought about what that 
meant. Emergency alert: time lost 
from essential supportive tasks, 
workers detailed to man the system 
that could block off long sections of 
the access galleries with solidifying 
liquid mucilage, masses of hyped- 
up workers arrayed behind secret 
exits, armed with stunwands and 
the few Outsider weapons the Hive 
could muster. 

“They’re coming on very fast,” 
Saldo said, nodding toward the dust 
cloud from the approaching vehi- 
cles. 

“They’re late,” Hellstrom said. 
“Something delayed them and 
they’re trying to make up for lost 
time. Are we all ready to clear out 
this aerie?” 

“I’d better give the word,” Saldo 
said. 

“In a moment,” Hellstrom said. 
“We can delay them at the gate. 
Were you able to reach Line?” 

“Nobody answers his phone. You 
know, when this is over I think we 
should provide him with a better 
Outside cover — a wife, another 
phone at his home tied to the ofFice 
line.” 

“Good idea,” Hellstrom said. He 
pointed toward the window. “Those 
are big campers. Could they be the 
ones that were on the mountain?” 



“They might — Nils, they are 
moving much too fast. They’re al- 
most at the fence. Maybe we 
should — ” 

He broke off in shocked alarm as 
the first of the big vans crashed 
through the north gate and swerved 
aside to block off the flat pillbox of 
the disguised ventilator outlet. Two 
figures leaped from the van as it 
skidded to a stop. One of them car- 
ried what appeared to be a black 
satchel. The other vans roared right 
past the stopped one, coming 
straight on for the house and the 
barn. 

“They’re attacking us!” Saldo 
yelled. 

A shattering explosion at the ven- 
tilator outlet punctuated his 
warning and was followed im- 
mediately by a second, louder ex- 
plosion. The first truck had been 
blown onto its side and was 
burning. 

Our own explosives for removing 
the emergency cover on that venti- 
lator, Hellstrom thought. 

There were other blasts now, 
shots, screams, running people. 
Two of the attackers spilled from a 
moving truck, ran crashing through 
the farmhouse door. 

“Nils! Nils!” Saldo was pulling 
frantically at his arm. “You’ve got 
to get out of here.” 

The Wisdom of Harl: A society 
that cuts across all conduct 
Outsiders accept can exist only 
in a constant state of siege. 

M IMECA/FANCY sat in the 
farmhouse living room 
waiting for the arrival of Janvert’s 
law when the first explosion rocked 



34 



GALAXY 




the building. A piece of metal from 
the first van ripped through the 
north wall of the building a foot 
above her head. It crashed into the 
opposite wall . and stuck there, 
smoking. Shots, screams, explo- 
sions erupted in the yard. 

Ducking low, Mimeca sprinted 
for the kitchen. Mrs. Niles stored a 
stunwand in there. She crashed 
through the swinging door, sur- 
prised Mrs. Niles using a stunwand 
to clear the yard between the farm- 
house and barn. Mimeca gave the 
scene only a passing glance. Her 
own presence to play the part of 
Fancy was vital to the Hive’s sur- 
vival. She had to save herself. A 
door behind Mrs. Niles opened 
onto solidly built old stairs into the 
original root cellar. Mimeca jerked 
the door open, thundered down the 
stairs. 

There was a loud crash overhead, 
shots, breaking glass. She dashed 
for some fake shelves that 
concealed a tunnel to the barn, 
squeezed through. Workers armed 
with stunwands were pouring 
toward her from the other end. Mi- 
meca ran panting past them, 
through the door to the barn 
basement. The tunnel behind her 
was already empty of defenders and 
she could hear the hiss of mucilage 
filling the area, plugging it. 

A short hall stretched in front of 
Mimeca, open at the far end into a 
scene which only the Hive-born 
would recognize as not one of utter 
confusion. She trotted toward the 
area. Workers were dashing 
about — packages were being car- 
ried toward the gallery head. A 
temporary repeater station had 
been installed against a wall on the 



left and guard workers were 
keeping it clear. 

As Mimeca entered this area the 
concealed hatch over the emer- 
gency stairs opened above her. 
Saldo and Hellstrom came dashing 
down, followed by armed workers. 
The opening of the hatch amplified 
the clamor of battle overhead, but 
the noise died abruptly. One more 
explosion came, another shot. She 
heard the brain-resonating hum- 
ming of many stunwands. 

Silence. 

Hellstrom saw Mimeca, signaled 
her to join him, but continued his 
course toward the temporary 
repeater station. 

A senior observer turned and 
recognized him, said, “We’ve ac- 
counted for the ones who got this 
far, but there are still two more 
down by the fence. They’re out of 
stun-range from this distance. Shall 
we get them from behind?” 

“Wait,” Hellstrom said. “Is it 
safe for us to go back to the aerie?” 

“The two by the fence are armed 
with at least one machine-gun.” 

“I will go back upstairs,” Saldo 
said. “You wait here. Don’t risk 
yourself, Nils.” 

“We’ll both go,” Hellstrom said. 
He motioned for Saldo to lead the 
way, spoke to Mimeca. “I’m glad 
you escaped — Fancy.” 

She nodded, beginning to recover 
her breath. 

“Wait here,” Hellstrom told her. 
“We may need you yet.” He 
turned, followed Saldo, who waited 
with armed workers at the stair- 
head. The abruptness and savagery 
of the attack still had Hellstrom in 
a state of shock. They were really 
into the fire now, really into it. 



PROJECT 40

T HE studio area of the bam 
presented a scene of re- 
markably little damage except for a 
hole blasted in the wall to one side 
of the north door. Some equipment 
had been scattered and lay in 
smashed disarray there. Part of the 
broken equipment included a small 
hive of the new guard-bees. The 
survivors were buzzing around an- 
grily, but were not attacking the 
Hive’s workers, which was a re- 
markable test of efficiency in the 
conditioning process. Hellstrom 
made a note to compliment the di- 
rectors of that project and to assign 
additional resources to it. 

The studio’s main boom had not 
been damaged. Saldo already was 
headed for its cage when Hellstrom 
emerged from the stairwell. 
Hellstrom swept his gaze around 
the studio as he followed. Workers’ 
bodies were being removed briskly 
by scavenger crews. Casualties, 
casualties, casualties! Damn those 
bloody murderers! Hellstrom felt 
himself experiencing a pure Hive 
reaction of violent outrage. He 
wanted to wave his arm to summon 
followers and sweep down upon the 
two remaining attackers, tear them 
apart with bare hands no matter 
what the cost. He sensed the 
matching eagerness of adrenalin- 
filled workers all around. They 
would follow him at the slightest 
gesture. They no longer were 
camera crews, actors, technicians, 
specialists in the multiple tasks by 
which the Hive collected Outsider 
energy /money. They were infu- 
riated workers, every last one of 
them. 

Hellstrom forced himself to cross 
calmly to the cage, joining Saldo 



there. He took a deep, trembling 
breath as he hopped into the cage. 
The Hive had never before been 
under such great threat and never 
before had it needed such cool 
thinking from its leader specialists. 

“Get a bullhorn,” Hellstrom told 
Saldo as the boom lifted them 
toward the aerie. “Call to the two 
remaining attackers that they must 
surrender or be killed. Try to take 
them alive.” 

“If they resist?” It was not 
Saldo’s normal voice, but pure 
emotion-charged male, primed for 
attack. 

“You must stop hoping that they 
will resist,” Hellstrom said. “They 
are to be stunned and taken alive if 
at all possible. See if you can get 
under them in the Hive with a stun- 
wand. That might be one way.” 

The cage wafted them gently to 
the edge of the loft. Hellstrom step- 
ped out, Saldo right behind him. 
The aerie baffle was open and ex- 
cited voices could be heard from 
inside. “Tell those workers in there 
to place more reliance on Hive-sign 
during stress periods,” Hellstrom 
ordered. “It keeps down the hub- 
bub and upset.” 

“Yes — yes, of course, Nils.” 
Saldo found himself awed by 
the cool command Hellstrom 
displayed. Here was the true mark 
of a leader specialist — rational 
assessment overpowering the anger 
that simmered underneath. 

Hellstrom stepped through the 
short entry to the aerie, barked, 
“let’s have some order in here! Res- 
tore that baffle. Is our telephone 
still open to the Outside?” 

The noise subsided immediately. 
Workers moved to obey. A security 



36 



GALAXY 




specialist standing at the end of the 
curved bench that had supported 
the repeaters, passed a telephone to 
Hellstrom. 

“Get the equipment back up 
here,” Hellstrom ordered as he 
took the telephone. “And send an 
observer down to Project Forty. 
The observer is not to interfere or 
interrupt in any way, simply ob- 
serve. At the first word of a 
breakthrough this observer is to 
report directly to me. Is that 
understood?” 

“Understood,” Saldo said and 
moved to obey. 

Hellstrom put the telephone to 
his ear, found it dead. He passed it 
back to the worker who’d given it to 
him. “Line’s dead. See about 
restoring it.” 

The worker took the phone, said, 
“It was working just a minute 

ago.” 

“Whom were you going to call. 
Nils?” 

“I was going to call Washington 
and try to find out if the time had 
come to bluff.” 

XXV 

From the diary of Trova 
Hellstrom: A filled life, good 
things in their own time, 
knowledge of constructive ser- 
vice to your fellows and into 
the vats when you die — that is 
the meaning of true fellowship: 
one in life, one in death. 

C LOVIS had assigned herself to 
the first van, overriding 
Myerlie’s objections that it was “no 
place for a woman.” She had told 
him where he could stuff that and 



he had slowly smiled, a knowing 
look behind his eyes. 

Then: “I understand, honey. It 
may be a bloody time at that farm- 
house and you don’t want to see 
your little Shorty-baby get it. If he 
does I’ll come back and tell you 
myself.” 

So he knows! she had thought. 

She had spat in his face, brought 
up her left hand for a chopping 
blow as he made to strike her. 
Others had intervened and DT had 
cried, “My God! This is no time to 
fight among ourselves! What are 
you two doing? Come on — let’s get 
it moving.” 

At the first opportunity they 
stopped the lead van, bound Kraft 
securely, gagged him and dumped 
him onto the bed in the rear. He 
objected that they were “going to 
pay for this — ” but a gesture with 
the gun in Clovis’s hand silenced 
him. He permitted himself to be 
bound then and lay afterward on 
the bed, eyes wide open, studying 
everything he could see. 

Clovis sat beside DT, who drovei 
She watched the passing scenery 
without really seeing it. So this was 
how it all ended. The people at that 
farm would kill Eddie at the first 
sign of attack. She had had time to 
think about it now and felt this as a 
certainty. She would do what any 
good agent would do. You didn’t 
leave danger behind your back. A 
red rage built before her eyes — it 
actually felt as though it were out- 
side her, beckoning her on. She also 
began to see possible other motives 
behind the Chiefs choice of her as 
leader of this attack. He had 
wanted the leader to be in a blind, 
killing rage.

It was after four o’clock before 
they started. A light breeze brushed 
ripples in the tall yellow rangegrass 
beside the dirt road. She saw the 
grass, focused on it, looked ahead 
and realized they had reached the 
last turn before the fence. DT was 
pushing the big van to its limit, 
roaring up the last mile of road. 
“You nervous?” DT asked. 

She glanced at the hard, youthful 
face, still dark with the kind of tan 
he’d developed in Vietnam. DT 
wore a green cap whose translucent 
plastic visor cast dark shadows over 
his eyes, accenting the small white 
scar in the shape of an inverted V at 
the bridge of his nose. 

“That’s a helluva question,” she 
said, raising her voice over the 
motor’s roar. 

“Nothing wrong with being 
nervous before a fight,” he said. “I 
remember one time in Nam — ” 

“I don’t want to hear about your 
stinking brawl!” she cut him off. 

He shrugged, noticed that her 
face was almost gray. She was 
taking this hard. Helluva business 
for a woman. Myerlie had been 
right. No sense getting into that 
scrap, though. If she wanted to be 
the gung-ho Mizz, that was her 
lookout. Just as long as she knew 
how to handle the satchel charge. 
From all reports, she did. 

“What do you do when you’re 
not working?” he asked. 

“What’s it to you. Junior?” 
“Christ, you’re feisty! I was just 
making conversation.” 

“Then make it with yourself.” 

Td rather make it with you, 
baby, he thought. You've got a nice 
body. And he wondered how Shorty 
enjoyed that. Everybody knew 



about those, two, of course. A real 
thing. Bad business in the Agency, 
not like he and Tymiena — good 
clean sex. That was why Clovis was 
taking this so hard, naturally. 
Shorty was sure as hell going to get 
it the minute they opened up. And 
with Shorty dead she’d wind up 
running this show. 

He glanced at her once more out 
of this new assessment. Did the 
Agency really trust this woman to 
run this sort of thing? 

“They’re not expecting us,” he 
said. “This could be a piece of cake. 
We’ll walk right through the place. 
How many people you think they 
have up there? Twenty? Thirty, 
maybe?” 

“It’s going to be a gawdawful 
mess,” she snarled. “Now shut up.” 



K RAFT, listening to them from 
the rear of the van, felt some- 
thing akin to pity. They were going 
to run into a wall of stunwands, 
every one set to maximum. It was 
going to be slaughter. He had 
resigned himself to dying with the 
pair in this van. What would those 
two do if they knew how many 
workers there really were in the 
Hive? What would they say if they 
came back and asked him and he 
told them, Oh, fifty thousand or so, 
give or take a couple of hundred. 

Clovis found herself becoming 
bitterly amused by DT’s spate of 
talk. The nervousness was in him, 
of course. She had gone beyond 
that stage to the killing rage the 
Chief probably wanted. They were 
close enough to the fence now to be 
able to see every exterior detail of 
the squat concrete structure beyond 



38 



GALAXY 




the gate. The afternoon light was 
beginning to draw its long shadows 
within the valley. She could see no 
sign of human activity at the farm- 
house or that portion of the bam 
visible from this vantage. She 
picked up her microphone from the 
radio under the dash to report this 
to the following vans, but the 
instant she hit the transmit button, 
the monitor telltale began to 
squeal. Jammed! Someone was 
jamming their frequency! 

She glanced at DT, whose tense 
side glances at the transmitter told 
her he, too, understood. 

She replaced the microphone on 
its hook, said, “Park the van 
between the farmhouse and the 
pillbox. You take the satchel. We’ll 
both get out your side. Toss the 
satchel along the wall to the east 
side of the pillbox. Get to the other 
side of it and cover me. I’ll set the 
charge. When it’s set we run like 
hell for the edge of that hill beyond 
there.” 

“The blast will wreck the van,” 
he objected. 

“Better it than us. Start revving 
her up. We can get more speed than 
this.” 

“What about our passenger?” 

“He takes his own chances. 1 
hope he gets it good!” She grabbed 
up the little burpgun from the floor, 
prepared to release her safety 
harness. DT wedged an elbow 
against the satchel charge which 
had been jammed between his seat 
and the emergency jump door. “Hit 
it square in the middle!” Clovis 
shouted. “It’s going to — ” 

Whatever she had been about to 
say was drowned in the clattering, 
screeching turmoil of their crash 



through the gate. There was no 
time to say anything more after 
that. 

From the diary of Trova 
Hellstrom: The nature of our 
Hive’s dependence upon the 
whole planet must be kept 
under constant review. This is 
especially true as regards the 
food chain and many of our 
workers do not understand this 
clearly. They think we can feed 
upon ourselves eternally. How 
stupid! Every food chain is 
based ultimately upon plants. 
Our independence hangs upon 
the quality and the quantity of 
our plants. They must always 
remain our plants, grown by us 
and their production balanced 
to the diet that provides us with 
increased health and longevity 
compared with the wild Out- 
siders. 

<< *TpHEY refused to answer our 
A hail,” Saldo said. He 
sounded grimly smug. 

Saldo stood beside Hellstrom in 
the gloomy north end of the aerie 
while workers behind them com- 
pleted restoring the chamber to its 
former efficiency. Only a shadowy 
louver stood between Hellstrom 
and the wrecked van just inside the 
gate. Flames still crackled in the 
van and around it. Its fuel had 
caught fire, blazing up with a roar, 
then exploding to set little spot fires 
in the surrounding grass. There 
would be a holocaust down there 
soon if the workers couldn’t get to 
it. 

“I realize that,” Hellstrom said. 

“What shall be our procedure?” 



PROJECT 40

Saldo asked with an odd formality. 
He was trying too hard to be cool, 
Hellstrom observed. 

“Use our guns. Try a few shots 
around them. See if you can’t herd 
them to the north and away from 
the fires to give us a chance to ex- 
tinguish them. Have you already 
sent the patrols out to watch the 
lower road from town?” 

“Yes. Do you want me to have 
them swing back and take this pair 
from behind?” 

“No. How are we doing at get- 
ting a stunwand below them?” 
“They’re not in a good position 
for that. We might hit some of our 
own people. You know how a hard 
charge bounces in dirt and rocks.” 
“Who’s in charge of the outer 
patrol?” 

“Ed.” 

Hellstrom nodded. Ed was a 
strong personality. He could con- 
trol the workers if anyone could. 
They must not, under any circum- 
stances, kill this pair. He felt this 
with growing certainty. The Hive 
needed a pair of survivors to 
question. He had to find out what 
had prompted this fierce attack. 
Hellstrom asked if this had been 
explained to Ed. 

“Yes. I told him myself.” Saldo 
sounded puzzled. Hellstrom was 
acting with a strange reserve. 

“Get started having that pair 
herded,” Hellstrom said. 

Saldo moved to relay the order, 
returned in moments. ' 

“Never forget,” Hellstrom said, 
“that the Hive is a flyspeck when 
compared to existing Outsider 
forces. We not only need that pair 
out there for their imformation — 
but for possible use in a com- 



promise. Has the telephone been 
restored yet?” 

“No. The break is somewhere 
near town. They must have cut the 
line.” 

“Likely.” 

“Why would they compromise 
with us?” Salao-asked. “If they can 
wipe us out — ” He broke off, shud- 
dered at t,he enormity of this 
thought. He felt a panicky incli- 
nation to disband the Hive, scatter 
the workers, hope for a few sur- 
vivors to restart. Surely all of them 
would perish if they stayed here. 
One atomic bomb— well, ten or 
twelve atomic bombs and. 

Salso began trying to express 
these fearful ideas to Hellstrom. 

“We’re not quite ready for that,” 
Hellstrom said. “I have taken the 
necessary steps if the worst should 
happen. Our records are ready to be 
destroyed quickly if we — ” 

“Our records?” 

“You know it would have to be 
done. I’ve sent the emergency 
signal to those who’ve been our eyes 
and ears Outside. As of now, they 
have been cut away from us. They 
may have to live out their lives now, 
eating mostly Outsider foods, 
obeying Outsider laws, accepting 
brief lives and empty Outsider 
pleasures as the final price of their 
service to us. They’ve always 
known this might happen. But some 
of them can survive. Any of them 
could begin a new Hive. No matter 
what happens here, Saldo, we are 
not completely lost.” 

Saldo closed his eyes, shuddering 
at the thought of such a prospect. 

“Have Janvert restored to a more 
complete awareness,” Hellstrom 
said. “We may need an envoy.” 



40 



GALAXY 




Saldo’s eyes snapped open. 
“Envoy? Jan vert?” 

“Yes — and see why it’s taking so 
long to gather in that last pair. 
They’ve obviously been herded out 
into the range. I can see workers 
beginning to fight the fires.” He 
stared out. “They’d better be quick 
about it, too. If we have too much 
smoke, we could get Outsider fire 
crews in here.” He looked back at 
the observation stations. “Do we 
have a phone connection yet?” 
“No,” one of the observers 
called. 

“Then use radio,” Hellstrom 
said. “Call the District Forest Ser- 
vice office in Lakeview. Tell them 
we’ve had a little grass fire here, but 
our people have it under control. 
We will not need Outside help.” 
Saida turned away to obey his 
instructions and marveled at the 
way all the scattered pieces of Hive 
Security were gathered into 
Hellstrom’s consciousness. Hell- 
strom had thought about the 
danger of Outside firefighters — no 
one else had thought of that. 
Another observer was calling to 
Hellstrom as Saldo let himself out 
of the aerie. 

H ellstrom took the latter 
call himself, recognizing a 
Physical Research specialist on the 
screen. The specialist began talking 
as soon as Hellstrom came into 
range of the pickup. “Get your in- 
terfering observer out of here, 
Nils!” 

“Has the observer caused trouble 
in the lab?” Hellstrom asked. 

“We are no longer in the lab.” 
“Where are you?” 

“We have taken over the main 



gallery at Level Fifty — the entire 
gallery. We must have it cleared for 
our installation. Your observer 
insists you told him to stay here.” 
Hellstrom thought about that 
gallery — more than a mile long. 
“Why do you need the entire 
gallery?” he asked. “We have 
essential support — ” 

“Your stupid workers can use the 
side tunnels,” the specialist snarled. 
“Get this cretin out of here! He is 
delaying us.” 

“The entire gallery,” Hellstrom 
said, “is quite a — ” 

“Your own information made 
this necessary,” the specialist 
explained in a tone of weary 
patience. “The Outsider observa- 
tions which you so kindly brought 
us. The problem is a matter of size. 
We are going to use the entire 
gallery. If your observer interferes 
you will find him in the vats.” 

The connection was broken with 
an angry blap. 

From the Hive Manual: The 
most powerful socializing force 
in the universe is mutual de- 
pendence. The fact that our key 
workers eat an additional diet 
of leader-food should never ob- 
scure from them their interde- 
pendence with those not chosen 
for this privilege. 

C LOVIS lay in deep shade be- 
neath a madrona copse about 
five hundred yards southeast of the 
gate into Hellstrom’s farm. She 
could see swarms of people fighting 
grass fires up by the fence. Some 
obviously had guns, not those mys- 
terious humming weapons she had 
seen knocking some of her team 



PROJECT 40

flat. There had to be five hundred 
people up there fighting those fires! 
Smoke swirled up — she could smell 
its alkali bitterness. 

She held her pistol in her right 
hand, resting it over her left 
forearm to steady it. They would 
come from that direction obviously. 
DT had worked down to the right 
behind her with the burpgun. She 
glanced back, trying to spot him. 
He’d said to give him ten minutes, 
then move back. He would cover 
her. 

She thought about the brief battle 
in the farmyard. She had never ex- 
pected anything even remotely like 
that experience. Gawdawful, yes — 
but not that. Nude men and wom- 
en carrying odd double-tipped 
weapons. She could hear the 
strange crackling hum of the damn 
things even yet. From the way her 
team had fallen under that weird 
barrage she suspected the things 
were lethal. 

A new kind of weapon — that had 
to be the answer to Project 40. She 
had expected weapons, but not 
anything like these. 

Why were the people nude? 

She had not yet allowed herself to 
ask what might have happened to 
Eddie Janvert. Her original guess 
stood. Dead — and probably by one 
of those odd weapons. The things 
had a limited range, however — 
about one hundred yards, she made 
it. Bullets from her pistol had the 
reach on them. The trick was to 
keep the attackers at a distance and 
look out for the few with guns. 

She glanced at her wristwatch — 
three minutes before she could 
move. 

God, it was hot. Dust from the 



grass tickled her nose. She stifled a 
sneeze. Something moved on the 
near slope of the hillside above the 
fence to the left of the gate. She 
snapped off two shots, reloaded, 
heard another shot from behind her 
and a call from DT. He was already 
in place. Good. To hell with waiting 
out the full ten minutes. She got to 
her knees, turned and sprinted out 
of the tree shadows in a running 
crouch, not looking back. To cover 
her was DT’s job. The odd hum- 
ming sound came from the hillside 
behind her, but there was only a 
faint tingling sensation along her 
spine. She wondered if it could be 
imagination, but fear added new 
energy to her muscles and she 
increased her speed. 

A shot sounded from her left and 
ahead — another, another. DT was 
using the burpgun on singleshot to 
slow down pursuers. She shifted 
course slightly to swing her course 
around the place where the shots 
originated. She still couldn’t see 
DT, but there was oak tree down 
there and some cows were running 
away beyond it with awkward, 
bounding gaits. She picked an oak 
to the left of the cows as her target, 
caught the tree with her left arm as 
she came to it, swung behind it. 
Sweat soaked her body and her 
chest ached with each panting 
breath. More shots came from 
DT’s position then, but she still 
couldn’t see him. Six nude figures 
were sprinting down the open 
rangeland from the valley, each 
carrying one of those weird double- 
ended wands. She drew three deep 
breaths to steady herself, rested her 
gun hand against the tree and 
spaced off four aimed shots. Two of 



42 



GALAXY 




the sprinters dropped with that 
jolting sprawl that said they had 
been hit. The others dove into the 
grass. 

DT came into sight abruptly, 
dropping from the other tree. He 
landed cat-footed and running, bore 
to his left, not looking back, not 
looking across at Clovis. A good 
teammate would cover for him and 
he had now accepted Clovis as a 
teammate. 

She reloaded, watching the grass 
move where the four survivors of 
her fusillade had gone to ground. 
They were crawling, obviously 
trying to get within range for their 
weapons. The grass rippled 
ominously, the movement coming 
nearer and nearer. She con- 
centrated on gauging distance. 
At about four hundred feet she 
lifted the magnum and began 
shooting. She took her time, spaced 
the shots carefully. At her third 
shot a figure lurched into view, top- 
pled backward. Three others arose 
from the grass, charged, pointing 
their wands at her. Taking her 
time — each of the remaining three 
shots had to count — she sighted on 
the first figure, a bald woman with 
face contorted into a fierce gri- 
mace. The shot stopped baldie as 
though she had run into a wall. Her 
weapon flew through the air as she 
fell sideways. The others dove for 
the grass. Clovis used her two 
remaining shots, putting them into 
the grass where the attackers had 
dropped. Without waiting to see the 
effect she turned and ran, reloading 
as she went. 

“Over here! Over here!” 

It was DT calling from another 
oak to her left. She changed course 



toward it, guessing he’d called be- 
cause there were no more trees in 
the rangeland beyond. It was open 
grassland down there, cropped 
close by cattle for at least half a 
mile. DT caught her arm to help 
stop her. 

“You know, that’s weird,” he 
said. “See how the cows have eaten 
the pasture down below us, but not 
up toward the farm. It’s almost as 
though the cows avoided that area. 
The ones I scared away from my 
first stand up there were real 
spooky, as though they’d been 
herded up there by something 
below us. I don’t see a sign of 
anyone down there, though.” 

S HE took a moment to catch her 
breath. Then: “You have any 
bright ideas how we’re going to get 
out of this?” 

“Keep on like we are,” he said. 
“We’ve got to get out and report 
what we’ve seen,” she said. 

She looked up at him, but he was 
keeping his attention on their 
backtrail. 

“I think you got another one of 
those creeps that dove into the 
grass,” he said. “Only one of them 
seems to be moving. You ready to 
make another run?” 

“As ready as I’ll ever be. You see 
anything of the one I missed?” 
“He’s still crawling, but he’s 
gonna run outa grass pretty soon. 
Let’s separate now. You bear a bit 
to your left until you hit the road, 
then try to follow it. I’ll hold right. 
The creek should be over there — 
you can see the line of trees off that 
way about a mile. We’ll give ’em 
two targets to chase. If I can reach 
the creek — ” 



PROJECT 40 



43 




DT had been scanning the ground 
toward the farm as he began 
speaking and, still speaking, turned 
to look in the direction they would 
run. Clovis whirled at the startled 
way DT stopped speaking. She let 
out an involuntary gasp. A solid 
line of hairless, nude human figures 
blocked their escape route. The line 
stood about five hundred yards 
below them, beginning far off to 
their left in the scrub oaks of rising 
ground there and reaching into the 
distance at the right, even beyond 
the trees that marked the creek 
bank where DT had expected to 
take cover. 

“Jeeee-sus!” DT said. 

There must be ten thousand of 
them, Clovis thought. 

“I haven’t seen that many gooks 
since Nam,” DT husked. “Jeeeee- 
sus! It’s like we stirred up a whole 
anthill of ’em.” 

Clovis nodded, thinking: That's 
exactly what we’ve done. 

The whole thing fell into place: 
Hellstrom was a front for some 
kind of weirdo cult. She noted the 
pale skins. They must live under- 
ground. The farm was just a caver. 
She stifled a hysterical giggle. No, 
the farm was only a lid] She raised 
her gun, intending to take as many 
of that ominous advancing line as 
possible, but a crackling hum from 
close behind numbed her body and 
mind. She heard one shot as she 
toppled, but could not decide 
whether it was from her gun or 
DT’s. 

XXVI 

From Nils Hellstrom' s diary: 
The concept of a colony 



planted directly in the middle 
of an existing human society is 
not unique to our group. There 
have been many secret groups 
and movements in hufrnan his- 
tory. Gypsies provide a crude 
analog of our way even today. 
No, we are not unique in this. 
But our Hive is as far removed 
from those others as they are 
removed from primitive, cave- 
dwelling humans. We are like 
the colonial protozoan, carche- 
sium, all of us in the Hive at- 
tached to a single, branching 
stem — and that stem concealed 
in the very ground beneath that 
other society, which believes it- 
self to be the meek who will in- 
herit the earth. Meek! That 
word originally meant “ mute 
and silent.” 

I T HAD been a frantic and 
confused flight from Balti- 
more — an hour’s layover at 
O’Hare, then the quick transfer to a 
chartered flight at Portland and the 
noisy discomfort of a single engine 
all the way up the Columbia Gorge. 
And then, as evening came down, 
the long haul diagonally across 
Oregon into the southeastern 
corner. 

Merrivale was in a violent mood 
when the plane set him down in 
Lakeview — and it was a mood am- 
plified by the elation that simmered 
in him. 

When he had least expected it, in 
fact when he had resigned himself 
to a degrading personal defeat, they 
had called on him. They — a board 
whose existence he had known 
about, but never identified — had 
chosen Joseph Merrivale as “our 



44 



GALAXY 




best hope to salvage something 
from this mess.” 

With both Peruge and the Chief 
dead, whom else did they have? The 
thought gave him a sense of per- 
sonal power which, in turn, fed his 
anger. Who was he to be subjected 
to such discomfort? 

The report passed to him quickly 
in Portland did little to mollify him. 
Peruge was exposed as criminally 
careless — spending the night with a 
woman like that. While on a job! 

The small plane landed in 
darkness and there was a gray sta- 
tionwagon with only a driver to 
greet him. The fact that the driver 
introduced himself as Waverly 
Gammel, SAIC (FBI-Special 
Agent In Charge) renewed the wor- 
ries Merrivale had managed to 
keep largely suppressed on the 
flight and this, too, fed his anger. 

They could be throwing me to the 
wolves, he thought as he got into 
the car beside the driver. This 
worry had simmered throughout 
the long trip from Portland. As 
darkness passed over the land he 
had looked down at the occasional 
winking of lights and thought bit- 
terly that people were going about 
their ordinary business down 
there — eating, going to movies, 
watching television, visiting friends. 
A comforting, ordinary life, Mer- 
rivale often fantasied, should have 
been his lot. The other side of his 
fantasy told him, though, that the 
silent pattern of safety below him 
depended largely upon his efforts to 
maintain it. They did not know 
down there what he was doing for 
them, the sacrifices he made. 

Even following one’s orders to 
the letter didn’t help to protect 



one — the sudden promotion had 
not changed this. It was a universal 
law — the Big fed upon the Small 
and there was always a Bigger to 
make one Smaller. 

SAIC Gammel was a man with a 
young mien and iron-gray hair. The 
harshly chiseled planes of his face 
strongly suggested American In- 
dian ancestry. The eyes were deeply 
set and shadowy in the light from 
the car’s dash. His voice was deep 
and revealed a faint twang. Texas? 

“Bring me up to date,” Merrivale 
said as Gammel took the car out of 
the airport parking lot. The FBI 
man drove with an easy competence 
and without concern for extending 
the car’s life. They bounced out on 
a rough track from the airport and 
turned left onto blacktop. 

“You know, of course, that there 
hasn’t been a word from the team 
you sent to the farm,” Gammel 
said. 

“They told me in Portland,” 
Merrivale said, forgetting momen- 
tarily to impose his superior British 
accent, then adding quickly: 
“Bloody lash-up!” 

Gammel stopped for an arterial 
sign, turned left onto a wider 
blacktop, waited for a noisy bus to 
pass him before continuing. “For 
the moment we agree with your 
assessment that the Fosterville 
deputy is untrustworthy and that 
there may be other questionables 
both in the sheriffs office and in the 
community itself. We are trusting 
no locals.” 

“What are you doing about the 
deputy?” 

“He was taken along by your 
people, you know. He hasn’t been 
heard from.” 



PROJECT 40 



45 




“What are you telling the local 
authorities?” 

“Spy stuff — hush-hush.” 

“They’re willing to stand aside?” 
“Not willing, but they’ve let dis- 
cretion overcome their valor. The 
political suggestions we initiated on 
high have the general tone of 
absolute commands at this level.” 
“Quite. Presumably you’ve al- 
ready invested the countryside 
around the farm.” 



/"^MMEL took his eyes off the 
road for a moment. Invested? 
Oh. yes — occupied. He said, “We’ve 
only brought in eleven men. It must 
remain at that for the moment. The 
Oregon highway patrol sent three 
cars and six men, but we haven’t let 
them fully into the picture. We’re 
mounting a limited operation on 
the rebuttable presumption that 
your office’s assessment is correct. 
However, at the slightest sign that 
you’ve misjudged the situation we’ll 
be forced to return to our book of 
rules— understood?” 

Rebuttable presumption, Mer- 
rivale thought. It was his kind of 
phrase and he savored it, tucking it 
away for later personal use in other 
company. He did not, however, like 
the implications behind the phrase 
and he said so. 

“Surely,” Gammel said, “you 
understand that we’re operating 
well outside the conventions. That 
team you sent in there had no legal 
standing whatsoever. That was an 
assault force, pure and simple. You 
guys make up your own rules as 
you go along. We can’t always do 
that. My instructions are clear. I’m 
to do everything in my power to 



help you with a cover story and/ or 
provide reasonable protection for 
your people as I am able, but — and 
this is a mighty large but — these 
instructions hold only for as long as 
your assessment of the situation is 
borne out.” 

Merrivale listened in frozen 
silence. It looked more and more as 
though the board had not promoted 
him, but was throwing him to the 
wolves. He had been an associate of 
two people, now dead, whose 
policies no longer could be de- 
fended. The board had sent him out 
here in the field all alone. You’ll get 
every assistance from the FBI in the 
field. If it is consistent with policy 
other backup will be sent along as 
you request it. 

Gobbledygook! 

He was one clear target if things 
went more sour. As though that 
were possible! He could almost 
hear the reorganization gears 
grinding back in Baltimore and 
Washington. They would say, Well, 
you knew what kind of a business 
this was when you got into it, 
Merrivale. They would appear 
professionally sorrowful while they 
brought up that standard phrase al- 
ways used for such occasions: In 
this business, you take your lumps 
when that’s required of you. 

That was the situation. No doubt 
of it. If it could be salvaged he 
would salvage it — but first he had 
to save himself. “Bloody hell,” he 
muttered and meant every syllable. 
“Let’s have the rest of it. What 
have you managed to learn about 
my people?” 

“Nothing.” 

“Nothing, hey?” Merrivale was 
outraged. He turned, studied Gam- 



46 



GALAXY 




mel’s face in the lights of an on- 
coming car. The FBI man held his 
features immobile, a dark piece of 
stone for all the emotion showing. 

“I would like that ‘nothing’ 
explained — provided you’re able to 
explain it,” Merrivale said, his tone 
distant and acid. 

“As per our instructions,” Gam- 
mel said, “we have been waiting for 
you.” 

Just following orders, Merrivale 
thought. 

He could see the implications. 
There was going to be only one 
responsible target in this situation. 
That was in Gammel’s orders, too. 
No doubt of it. No bloody doubt of 
it. 

“I find this almost incon- 
ceivable,” Merrivale said. He 
turned, looked out at the darkness 
flashing with vague movements on 
his right as the car sped toward 
Fosterville. He could make out that 
they were passing through open 
countryside, the road climbing 
slightly — hills made dim shapes 
ahead in starlight. Few other cars 
shared the road. The dark land- 
scape carried a sense of loneliness 
that rubbed at Merrivale’s feelings 
of abandonment. 

“Let’s not misunderstand each 
other,” Gammel said. “I came out 
here alone to pick you up just so we 
could talk openly.” Gammel 
glanced at Merrivale. The poor sod 
was in the jaws of the vise, no 
mistaking that. Was he just now be- 
coming aware of it? 

“Then why aren’t you talking 
openly?” Merrivale demanded. 

lies more on the attack than the 
situation really requires , Gammel 
thought. Does that mean he has in- 



formation that might throw his 
Agency’s position into doubt? I 
wonder . 

“I’m doing my best within my 
instructions,” Gammel said. “I had 
less than an hour at Fosterville 
before they signaled that you’d be 
coming in at Lakeview. I had to 
rush like hell to get there. They said 
you were coming in at Lakeview be- 
cause it had the nearest field with 
lights. Was that it — or was there 
another reason?” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I’m still wondering about our 
own casualties — up at The Sisters.” 
“Oh — yes, of course. That was in 
the report I had at Portland. 
There’s still nothing conclusive or 
I’d have mentioned it earlier. The 
fire played bloody hob with the 
wreckage. It could have been 
lightning and a fuel explosion. They 
said the pilot should have gone up 
through the Columbia Gorge, but 
he was trying to save time by flying 
direct.” 

“They haven’t ruled out sabo- 
tage?” 

“They have not. High probability 
if you ask me. Damn stupid kind of 
coincidence, don’t you think?” 
“We’re acting on that assump- 
tion,” Gammel said. 

“What’ve you done with your 
eleven men and the highway 
patrol?” Merrivale asked. 

“I’ve dispatched three cars — two 
men each. One of the OHP cars 
with three officers was sent around 
to the south. That’s going to take a 
little time. For part of that trip they 
will be out of range of the radio 
relay equipment.” 

“But what are these three cars 
doing?” 



PROJECT 40 



47 




“We’ve set up a communications 
base in the motel at Fosterville. The 
cars are maintaining contact with 
that base at regular intervals. My 
cars are deployed between 
Fosterville and the farm and 
they — ” 

“Two cars between town and the 
farm?” 

“No, three cars. The OHP car is 
a fourth. My three cars are 
deployed in a wide surveillance pat- 
tern — one on a Forest Service road 
to the east and the other two spaced 
along the actual road to the farm. 
They were instructed to approach 
no closer than two miles.” 

“Two miles?” 

“Correct — and they were told to 
stay in their cars.” 

“But two miles — ” 

“When we’re fairly certain of 
what we’re doing and what we’re up 
against we don’t mind taking 
risks,” Gammel said. “But this case 
appears to be nothing but un- 
certainties.” He spoke in a level 
voice, trying to hold his temper. 
Merrivale’s carping was becoming 
insufferable. Didn’t he realize he 
might be wearing Gammel’s own 
handcuffs before another twenty- 
four hours was out? They might 
have to arrest Merri vale just to save 
the FBI’s neck. What did this bas- 
tard expect? 

“But two—” 

“You’ve lost how many people in 
there?” Gammel demanded, not 
trying to hide his anger now. 
“Twelve? Fourteen? I’m told there 
were nine people in that team you 
sent in today and you lost at least 
one team before that. Do you take 
us for morons?” 

“Fourteen, counting Dzule Pe- 



ruge,” Merrivale said. “Your 
ability to count is unimpaired,” In 
the dim green light of the dash, he 
noted a muscle working along 
Gammel’s jaw, the tense-knuckled 
way the man gripped the wheel as 
he drove. 

“So we have one certainly dead, 
thirteen missing and our own 
planeload down in The Sisters — 
that’s twenty in all. You dare ask 
me why I haven’t sent my people in 
there after yours? If I had my way 
we’d have a regiment of marines on 
hand — but I don’t have my way. 
Why don’t I? Because this whole 
thing smells of a lashup by your 
people. And if it explodes we’re not 
going to get burned in the blast. Is 
that clear enough for you? Is that 
open enough?” 

“Bloody pack of cowards,” Mer- 
rivale muttered. 

G AMMEL suddenly swerved the 
" car off the road, skidded to a 
stop in gravel, set the handbrake 
with an angry rasping of its latch, 
turned off the lights and the motor. 
He whirled on the seat to face Mer- 
rivale. “Look, you! I understand 
the hot seat you’re on — at least I 
have a good idea of the bind you’re 
in. But my agency has not been in 
this from the first, although it 
should have been! Now — if that 
turns out to be a nest of Commies 
up there we’ll mop it up and have 
ail the help we need. If it turns out 
to be an arm of a major industry in 
this country trying to protect a new 
invention from the vultures you 
represent — that is an entirely dif- 
ferent ballgame.” 

“What do you mean? Industry — 
new invention?”

“You know damned well what I 
mean! We didn’t sit around on our 
tails accepting you people as our 
only sources of information.” 
Merrivale wondered. If they have 
the whole story why are they still 
helping us? 

As though he had heard the 
question Gammel said, “Our 
position in this is to try to keep the 
crud from hitting the fan. You rub 
dirt on your outfit and you rub dirt 
on the whole government. If you’ve 
been sent out here as a patsy I can 
sympathize. But there’s no sense in 
our fighting each other. If this 
thing’s ready to blow and you’re 
here to take the rap you’d better 
level with me right now. Are you?” 
Taken aback by Gammel’s sud- 
den stop and attack, Merrivale 
sputtered a moment. Then: “Now, 
see here! If you — ” 

“Are you here to take the rap?” 
“Of course not.” 

“Bull.” Gammel shook his head. 
“You think we don’t have our own 
suspicions about why your boss 
took the short road to hell?” 

“The short road to — ” 

“Jumped out of that damned 
window! Are you their patsy?” 

“I was sent here with the under- 
standing that you would provide 
full cooperation until we could field 
new teams,” Merrivale said, 
speaking stiffly. “I don’t find your 
present attitude cooperative in the 
least.” 

Still not mollified, Gammel said, 
“Tell me, yes or no — do you have 
new information that dramatically 
alters your original assessment?” 
“Of course not.” 

“Nothing new to tell me?” 

“I will not be cross-examined by 



you,” Merrivale protested. “You 
know as much about this situation 
as I do. More. You’ve at least been 
on the scene.” 

“I hope you’re telling the truth,” 
Gammel said. “If you aren’t — I 
personally will supervise whatever 
action we have to take to fry you.” 
He turned, restarted the car, eased 
back onto the highway. He turned 
on his lights as he moved and they 
startled a big black-and-white cow 
that had wandered onto the berm. 
It galloped ahead of them for 
several hundred feet before diving 
into the open grassland beside the 
road. 

Considerably subdued and now 
frightened at the position he might 
be in if he had no cooperation at all 
from the FBI, Merrivale said, “I’m 
truly sorry if I’ve offended you. 
You can imagine I’ve been under 
somewhat of a strain. First the 
Chiefs death and then the orders to 
take over here personally. No sleep 
really since this all started.” 

“Have you eaten?” 

“On the plane from Chicago.” 
“We can get you something at 
our headquarters in the motel.” 
Gammel reached for the small 
microphone under the dash, said, 
“I’ll have them lay on coffee and 
sandwiches. What would you — ” 
“No need for that,” Merrivale 
said, feeling somewhat better. 
Gammel obviously was trying to 
get back on a friendly footing. That 
made sense. Merrivale cleared his 
throat. “What sort of an action 
plan have you devised?” 

“We do only a minimum in the 
dark. We wait for morning and re- 
connoiter in daylight and under 
constant radio contact with base. 



PROJECT 40

That’s clearly indicated until we 
find out what the hell has happened. 
We can’t trust the local law. I’ve 
even been told to play it cool with 
the OHP. Our primary concern is 
to clarify some of this water that’s 
been badly muddied up to now.” 
Muddied by our people, of 
course, Merrivale thought. The FBI 
people were still a bunch of bloody 
snobs. He said, “Nothing more 
tonight?” 

“It didn’t strike me as advisable 
to run any more risks than 
absolutely necessary. We’ll have 
more muscle by morning.” 
Merrivale brightened. “More 
people?” 

“Two marine choppers coming 
up from San Francisco.” 

“You ordered them?” 

“We’re still covering for you,” 
Gammel said. He turned, grinned. 
“They are for surveillance and/or 
transportation only. We stretcned 
our good-will account considerably 
to get them with no better expla- 
nation than we could give at the 
time.” 

“Very well,” Merrivale said. 
“Portland told me you had no 
telephone contact with the farm. Is 
that situation the same?” 

“The line’s out,” Gammel said. 
“Probably cut by your people when 
they went in. We’ll have a repair 
crew out in the morning. Our own 
people, of course.” 

“I see. Then I concur with your 
field decisions, subject, naturally, 
to review when we reach your head- 
quarters. They may have more 
recent information.” 

“They’d have called me,” Gam- 
mel said. He tapped the radio under 
the dash, thinking: They’ve sent a 



stuffed shirt. He’s a patsy for sure 
and the poor bastard may not even 
know it. 

XXVII 

From the Hive Manual: As a 
biological mechanism, human 
reproduction is not terribly ef- 
ficient. When compared to 
insects, humans appear grossly 
inefficient. The insect and all 
the lower life forms are dedi- 
cated to species survival. Sur- 
vival comes through reproduc- 
tion, through mating. Males 
and females of all life forms 
other than man are drawn 
together in the direct and sin- 
gular interest of reproduction. 
For the wild forms of human- 
kind, however, unless the set- 
ting is right, the perfume is 
right, the music is sweet — and 
unless at least one partner feels 
loved (a singularly unstable 
concept) by the other, the re- 
productive act may never oc- 
cur. We of the Hive are dedi- 
cated, therefore, to freeing our 
workers from the concept of 
romance. The act of pro- 
creation must occr as simply, 
as naturally and obliviously as 
eating. Beauty r romance, or 
love must not figure in Hive re- 
production, but only the de- 
mands of survival, 

T HE night-shrouded country- 
side around the farm now 
appeared asleep to Hellstrom as he 
scanned it from the aerie. Darkness 
blotted out the familiar landscape 
and only a distant glimmer of light 
on the dim horizon indicated 



50 



GALAXY 




Fosterville. The Hive beneath him 
had never felt more silent, more 
charged with the tensions of 
waiting. Although the Oral 
Tradition spoke of early confronta- 
tions during which the whole 
Colony Movement (as it was called 
then) faced extinction, the Hive had 
never faced a greater crisis. The 
present events had come about in 
such natural stages that Hcllstrom, 
looking back, experienced a sense 
of the inevitable. The Hive’s popu- 
lation of almost 50,000 workers de- 
pended for their continued exis- 
tence upon decisions he and his 
aides made during the next few 
hours. 

He glanced over his shoulder at 
the swampfire glow of cathodes, the 
screens that watched over the Out- 
siders who had come up from 
Fosterville just after dark. Three 
unmarked cars were parked out 
there in the rangeland now, little 
more than two miles away. A 
fourth car, identified as belonging 
to the highway patrol, had been 
with them at first, but was now la- 
boring its way around to' the south 
of the valley. The only track open 
to it there was the old Thimble 
Mine road and that led no closer to 
the farm than ten miles — from 
there it would have to cross open 
country. Hellstrom suspected the 
vehicle might have four-wheel 
drive, but the character of the land 
to the south was such that the OHP 
car could not get closer than three 
miles from the Hive’s perimeter at 
best. 

The aerie’s workers, sensing the 
weight of decisions on Hellstrom, 
had lowered their voices and moved 
softly. 



Should I use Janvert as a 
mediator? 

But mediation should begin from 
a position of strength and the Hive 
had only a bluff. The secret of the 
stun wand might be something 
valuable to offer. Janvert had seen 
it in action. He would know, too, 
about the Hive’s mastery of human 
chemistry. He had his own reac- 
tions to verify that. But Janvert 
could only become the Hive’s 
enemy if he went out as an envoy. 
He had seen too much of the Hive 
even to consider neutrality. 

Hellstrom glanced at the clock be- 
hind the arc of surveillance instru- 
ments — 11:29 p.m. It was almost 
tomorrow — and the morning was 
certain to bring a showdown. He 
could sense that in many things, 
including the watchful waiting of 
the three cars parked between the 
Hive and Fosterville. Thinking 
about the occupants of those cars 
Hellstrom felt a need to know what 
they were doing now. He returned 
to the observer station, asked a 
coordinating specialist, whose face 
looked deathly pale in the green 
gloom. 

“The men are remaining inside 
the cars,” the specialist said. “Their 
reporting schedules are staggered 
but about ten minutes apart for any 
given car. We are confident now 
that there are no more than two 
Outsiders in each car.” 

Waiting for daylight , Hellstrom 
realized. He said as much. 

“That’s the general opinion 
here,” the specialist said. “That 
middle car is only about twenty-five 
yards from one of the hidden exits, 
the one at the end of the gallery on 
Level Two.” 



PROJECT 40 



51 




“You’re suggesting we try to 
bring in the Outsiders?” 

“It would give us answers to 
some questions.” 

“It also might ignite a general at- 
tack. I think we’ve pushed our luck 
as far as it will go.” Hellstrom rub- 
bed the back of his neck. He felt 
worn out, running on nerve. “What 
about the car that’s going around to 
the south?” 

“It’s stuck about where the old 
mine road starts to cross Muddy 
Bottom, distance about eight miles 
from our perimeter and at least 
twelve miles from the valley.” 

“Thank you.” Hellstrom turned 
away. 

The aerie was quieter now than it 
had been when he had arrived two 
hours before. Groups of Security 
specialists had been passing 
through then, being briefed for 
nightsweep. All had faded away 
into the outside darkness now, were 
nothing but signal points on the 
aerie’s instruments, glowing figures 
on the screens. 

For perhaps the tenth time since 
taking up station in the aerie, 
Hellstrom thought, / should rest. 
I’ll need all my alertness by day- 
light. They will come upon us in the 
morning — / more than anyone 
should be ready for them. Many of 
us probably will die tomorrow. 
Perhaps I can save some if I’m 
alert. 

He thought sadly of Lincoln 
Kraft, whose charred body (hardly 
enough left to bother taking to the 
vats) had been removed from the 
wreckage of one of the attackers’ 
vans. Kraft’s death made the day’s 
loss thirty-one. 

Just a beginning. 



Again Hellstrom thought about 
the three prisoners — it seemed 
strange for the Hive to be holding 
prisoners. Outsider adults seemed 
naturally to belong to the vats. 
Only very small children had been 
considered truly worthy of being 
reshaped for the Hive’s uses. Now 
there were new possibilities. 

J ANVERT, the most puzzling of 
the three, had a background in 
law, Hellstrom had learned through 
careful questioning. Janvert might 
be ridiculously easy to wean from 
Outside ways, provided he could be 
sufficiently tempered to Hive 
chemistry. The female, Clovis Carr, 
was a carrier of aggressive charac- 
teristics the Hive might turn to its 
advantage. The third one, whose 
identification papers said he was 
one Daniel Thomas Alden, carried 
himself like a soldier. There could 
be valuable characteristics in all of 
them — but Janvert remained the 
most interesting. He was small, too, 
which was desirable in the Hive. 

Hellstrom turned back to the 
observer stations, bent low over one 
worker to ask quietly, “What about 
our patrol in the creekbottom? Has 
it anything new to report on the 
conversation from that car under 
surveillance?” 

“The Outsiders are still puzzled, 
Nils. They call this a ‘very strange 
case’ and they refer occasionally to 
someone named Gammel, who ap- 
parently believes the ‘case’ is a 
snafu. What’s a snafu?” 

“A foulup,” Hellstrom trans- 
lated. “It’s military slang: Situation 
Normal All Fouled Up.” 
“Something that has gone wrong, 
then.” 



52 



GALAXY 




“Yes. Tell me if you hear 
anything new.” 

Hellstrom straightened, thought 
of calling Saldo. The younger man 
had been sent to keep a discreet 
observation on Project 40, working 
from one end of the long gallery at 
Level Fifty. It was not a good 
vantage point, because the major 
work was being conducted toward 
the middle of the gallery, at least 
half a mile from the end, but the 
Researchers had shown increasing 
irrascibitity after the earlier inci- 
dent with an ‘inferfering observer.’ 
Hellstrom was counting on Saldo’s 
intelligence to manage the situa- 
tion. It was a matter of desperate 
urgency for him to know instantly if 
the situation in the lab changed. 

We could never get away with a 
bluff against the Outsiders, 
Hellstrom told himself. The Hive 
might gain a little time for itself, 
might be able to parlay the stun- 
wands into a temporary belief in a 
more potent weapon built on the 
same principle. But the Outsiders 
would need a demonstration. And 
there was always Harl’s warning to 
consider. The threat to use an 
absolute weapon put the trigger in 
the hands of an opponent who 
might say, So use it! The weapon 
must be applicable at less than 
absolute energies and that fact must 
be demonstrable, unmistakably 
demonstrable. The Outsiders had a 
saying that fitted the situation 
aptly: Don’t kid the kidders. A 
bluff would not work for long. It 
would be called — and then what? 

The wild Outsiders were truly 
strange. They tended not to believe 
in violence until it was inflicted 
upon them. They had a saying 



about this, too: It can't happen 
here. 

Perhaps this was inevitable in a 
world that based its societies on 
threat, violence and illusions of 
absolute power. How could people 
such as Jan vert be expected to think 
in more malleable terms, to think 
of life dependencies and the inter- 
locked relationships of living sys- 
tems, to think of inserting the 
human species into the great circle 
of life? Such concepts would be gib- 
berish to Outsiders, even those who 
spoke for the new fad known as 
Ecology. 



From Joseph Merrivale’s pri- 
vate notes: As per the instruc- 
tions handed to me at JFK Air- 
port, I arrived late Sunday in 
Lakeview to establish prelimi- 
nary liaison with SAIC-FBI 
Waverly Gammel, who had set 
up a base in Fosterville. He 
took me to Fosterville where 
we arrived at 2318 hours. Gam- 
mel reported having taken no 
action except minimal sur- 
veillance of target area from 
distance of approximately two 
hours and involving only four 
vehicles with nine men. Ac- 
cording to Gammel, this was in 
compliance with his instruc- 
tions, a statement that does not 
accord with what I was led to 
believe at the action briefing. 
Gammel reports no word from 
any of our teams that entered 
the target area earlier. Gammel 
evinces doubts that this case in- 
volves narcotics. He has seen 
the preliminary report on Pe- 
ruge’s autopsy. I must protest 
my dependence upon another 



PROJECT 40 



53 




agency for the manpower to 
prosecute this case. Divided au- 
thority is producing a situation 
fraught with potential embar- 
rassments and inconveniences. 
The loose working agreement 
under which I must perform 
my duties can only exacerbate 
present difficulties. Since many 
actions have already been 
taken in the field on this case 
without my knowledge or 
agreement I must lodge my 
formal protest at the earliest 
opportunity. My capacity in 
the present contratemps bodes 
ill for our responsibilities. 1 
must make it clear that none of 
the conduct in this case has ac- 
corded with my own under- 
standings of the decisions re- 
quired to resolve the situation. 

S AL DO made record time 
coming up from the Hive’s 
5,000-foot level where the Re- 
searchers had moved their opera- 
tions. There were fast elevators 
only in the so-called New Galleries 
below 3,100 feet, but even these be- 
came progressively slower the 
higher he went. The New Galleries 
work delayed him slightly at 3,800 
feet, but he bulled his way through, 
making a note to ask Hellstrom if 
that work could not be put on 
minimum standby during the 
present crisis. 

He had left a young assistant 
seated at the southeast end of the 
long gallery of the relocated lab 
with a secret weapon Saldo had 
commandeered — those binoculars 
once used by the Outsider, De- 
peaux. The binoculars revealed a 
spate of activity by the Re- 



searchers — this Saldo interpreted 
as readiness for a test of the system. 
He dared not approach the spe- 
cialists, though. Hellstrom’s orders 
had been explicit on that score. 
Only Hellstrom might change that 
now and, knowing the urgency, 
Saldo went to argue for a small 
interruption of the lab work. 

It was almost midnight when the 
boom cage deposited him on the 
catwalk outside the aerie. A 
guardworker there passed him with 
only a casual glance of recognition. 
The inner room was dim and oddly 
hushed to him as he passed through 
the baffle. He saw that most of the 
Hive’s leadership cadre had taken 
over the night duty with Hellstrom, 
who stood at the room’s north end, 
a blocky figure against the dark 
outline of the louvered window. 
Saldo found he did not have the 
highest regard for the leadership 
qualities of more of those present, 
excepting Hellstrom — and some- 
times not excepting Hellstrom 
himself. Some of these workers 
should be conserving their strength 
for the morrow. He knew this inner 
reaction reflected a pattern which 
had been bred and conditioned into 
him, but the knowledge subtracted 
little from his assessment of his own 
personal qualifications Hellstrom 
should be resting now — as should at 
least half those present. 

Hellstrom turned as Saldo made 
his way through the green gloom. 
He asked, “Is there something to 
report?” 

Saldo moved close to Hellstrom 
and, speaking in a low voice, 
explained why he had left the lab. 

“Are you sure they’re about to 
test it?” 



54 



GALAXY 




“It looks that way. They’ve been 
stringing the power cables for 
several hours. I noted before that 
they didn’t bother with the power 
cables on the other models until 
they were about to test.” 

“How soon?” 

“That’s difficult to say.” 
Hellstrom moved back and forth 
a few paces restlessly, fatigue 
visible in the controlled precision of 
his actions. He stopped in front of 
Saldo. “I don’t see how they could 
be testing it this soon.” He rubbed 
his chin. “They said the new model 
would have to use the entire 
gallery.” 

“They are using the gallery, all of 
it — and fans. And they are con- 
necting a strange construction of 
pipes down the entire length of the 
gallery. They’re supporting the pipe 
on anything they can collect — 
chairs, benches . It’s a very 
strange thing they’re building. They 
even took a heavy-duty pump from 
Level Forty-Two Hydroponics. 
They just went right in, discon- 
nected it and took it. The Hydro- 
ponics manager was upset, as you 
can imagine, but they merely said 
you had authorized it. Is that true?” 
“In essence,” Hellstrom said. 
“Nils, do you think it likely 
they’d behave this way unless they 
were about to test and were 
reasonably sure of success.” 
Privately Hellstrom agreed with 
Saldo, but there were other 
considerations — and he had not yet 
dared to let himself hope. The spe- 
cialists’ behavior might be a 
reflection of the upset that had 
spread throughout the Hive. 
Hellstrom did not think this likely, 
but it was possible. 



“Shouldn’t you go down and 
make a personal inquiry?” Saldo 
asked. 

Hellstrom sympathized with 
Saldo’s impatience. It was shared 
by many in the Hive. Was anything 
to be served by going down there 
now himself, though? The spe- 
cialists might not tell him anything. 
They were naturally wary of pre- 
dicting the outcome of any project. 
They spoke of probabilities when 
they did speak — or of “possible 
consequences in certain lines of 
development.” This was under- 
standable. Experiments had been 
known to turn upon the experi- 
menters. An earlier test model in 
Project 40 had created an explosive 
plasma bubble that had killed fifty- 
three workers, including four Re- 
searchers, and had spread havoc 
two hundred feet in a side gallery at 
Level Thirty-Nine. 

“What power-drain figures did 
they give Generation?” Hellstrom 
asked. “How much diversion do 
they require?” 

“The Generation specialists 
asked, but were told the com- 
putation is not complete. I’ve 
posted another observer in 
Generation, however. Surely the 
Researchers must at least ask for 
the diversion.” 

“Will Generation make an esti- 
mate based on the size of the power 
cables being used?” 

“As much as five hundred thou- 
sand kilowatts. It could be less, 
though.” 

“That much?” Hellstrom took a 
deep breath. “Researchers are dif- 
ferent from the rest of us in many 
ways, Saldo. They were bred for a 
rather narrow vision, a con- 



p ROJECT 40 



55 




centrated attention of the in- 
tellect. We should be prepared for 
the possibility of a disastrous 
failure.” 

“A dis — ” Saldo fell into stricken 
silence. 

“Prepare to evacuate the area for 
at least three levels around the test 
gallery,” Hellstrom said. “You are 
to post yourself in Generation. Tell 
the managing specialist he is not to 
connect the power cables until I 
have given permission. When the 
Researchers come to make the 
power arrangments, call me. Ask 
them then, if you’re able, what 
range and error factor they are esti- 
mating for the project. Get the 
power figures and — at the same 
time — order the evacuation of the 
galleries to proceed. We will risk no 
more workers than necessary.” 

S ALDO stood in subdued awe. 

He felt depressed, rebounding 
from his former pride. None of 
these precautions had entered his 
mind. He had thought only to argue 
Hellstrom into one particular 
course of action. The stratagem of 
stationing an observer right in 
Generation with the authority to 
delay the power hookup, however, 
filled the demands of Saldo’s own 
plan and did far more. 

“Perhaps you’d better send some- 
body with more imagination and 
ability to Generation,” Saldo said. 
“Maybe Ed—” 

“You are the one I want in 
Generation,” Hellstrom said. “Ed 
is a seasoned specialist with long 
experience Outside. He can think 
like an Outsider, which you cannot. 
He also has had sufficient 
tempering, so that he seldom over- 



estimates his own capabilities — or 
underestimates them. In a word, he 
is balanced. If we are to survive 
these next hours, we require this 
quality above all others. I trust you 
to carry out my orders carefully 
and completely. I know you can 
and will. Now get back to your 
station.” 

Saldo’s shoulders came up and he 
looked at Hellstrom’s fatigue-lined 
features. “Nils, I didn’t think — ” 

Hellstrom interrupted in a softer 
tone. “In part it is my fatigue that 
is being short and severe with you. 
This is something you should have 
taken into consideration. You 
could have called me on the internal 
system without leaving your post. A 
true leader considers many possi- 
bilities before acting. If you were 
ready for leadership you would 
have thought to conserve my 
energies as well as your own. You 
will grow into this ability — and the 
delay time between your required 
consideration of many courses and 
your decision to act correctly will 
grow shorter and shorter.” 

“I’m going back to my post at 
once,” Saldo said. He turned, 
started across the room. As he 
moved voices were raised at the ob- 
server stations. A garble of sound 
could be heard coming over one of 
the communicators. An observer 
could be heard asking, “Who else is 
there to take charge?” Another 
garble of sound erupted from the 
communicators. “One at a time!” 
the observer shouted. Then: “Tell 
them to hold their stations. If too 
many of us are running around 
without coordination we’ll just get 
in each other’s way. We’ll take 
charge of the search from here.”

GALAXY 




The observer, a young female 
subleader-in-training, whose face 
appeared an oval mask of shock in 
the light from her screen, lifted 
herself half out of her chair to peer 
across the bank of instruments at 
Hellstrom. “One of the captives has 
escaped into the Hive!” 

Hellstrom was at her side as soon 
as he could get there. Saldo hesi- 
tated at the door. 

“Which one?” Hellstrom de- 
manded, bending over the observer. 

“The one called Janvert. Shall we 
dispatch workers to — ” 

“No.” 

Saldo spoke from the door. 
“Nils, should I — ” 

“Get to your station!” Hellstrom 
called, not moving his gaze from 
the screen in front of the young ob- 
server. A frightened guardworker 
appeared on her screen, a young 
male with the shoulder mark of 
dronedom. “Which level?” Hell- 
strom demanded. 

“Forty-two,” the worker in the 
screen said, “And he has a stun- 
wand. He killed two workers, the 
ones who said they were sent to — 
to — at your orders to — ” 

“1 understand,” Hellstrom inter- 
rupted. And he thought, The spe- 
cialists I sent down to bring Janvert 
to sufficient alertness for use as an 
envoy. Something had gone wrong 
and Janvert had escaped. Hellstrom 
straightened, swept his gaze over 
the workers around him in the 
aerie. “Awaken your replacements. 
Janvert has been Hive-marked. No 
common worker would recognize 
him as an Outsider. He can move 
anywhere in the Hive without at- 
tracting attention. We have a 
double problem. We must re- 



capture him and we must not upset 
the Hive any more than has already 
been done. Make that clear to every 
searcher. Send your replacements 
after Janvert with a physical 
description. Issue Outsider guns to 
at least one worker in each search 
party as long as the guns last. I 
don’t want stunwands used in the 
Hive under these circumstances." 

“You want him dead and in the 
vats then,” a worker behind 
Hellstrom said. 

“No, I do not.” 

“But you said — ” 

“One gun, one stunwand with 
each party,” Hellstrom said. “The 
gun is to wound him in the legs only 
if nothing else can be done to stop 
him. I want him taken alive. Do 
you all understand that? We need 
this Outsider alive.”

From the Hive Manual: Life 
must take life for the sake of 
life, but no worker should enter 
this great wheel of regeneration 
with any motive other than the 
perpetuation of our species. 
Only in the species are we 
linked to Infinity and this has a 
different meaning for the 
species than it does for the 
mortal cell. 

J ANVERT had taken a long time 
coming to a full realization of 
the strangeness in his position. For 
a while he felt he had become two 
distinctly different people, both of 
whom he remembered clearly. One 
of these people had studied law, 
joined the Agency, loved Clovis 
Carr and felt himself trapped in 



project 40

activities that dehumanized him. 
The other one seemed to have 
awakened as a fully recognizable 
individual while eating a meal with 
Nils Hellstrom and a rather doll- 
like woman named Fancy. This 
other individual had behaved in a 
wildly detached manner. This indi- 
vidual remembered walking meekly 
with Hellstrom into a room where 
people stood around and asked 
questions. As this weird other, 
Janvert recalled, he had answered 
those questions with complete 
candor. He had answered willingly, 
searching out details that might ex- 
pand the answers. He had actually 
worked very hard to make his 
answers understood. 

There were some other strange 
memories, too — big open tanks in a 
tremendous room, some bubbling 
and seething. Another equally large 
room he recalled as crawling with 
toddlers, little children who 
bounced and played in odd silence 
on a screened floor that surged 
under them like a trampoline. The 
smell from that room he recalled as 
acid, but with a sense of cleanliness 
about it. He remembered water 
spurting suddenly from the ceiling 
onto the toddlers as he passed and 
then that other smell, the one he re- 
called from the whole other-Janvert 
experience and had around him 
even now. It was fetid, rank and 
warm in the nostrils. 

The self he thought of as his 
original identity appeared to have 
been dormant all during the other- 
Janvert experience — but it was 
aware now. He recognized where he 
was in both sets of memories. It 
was a windowless room with rough 
gray walls, a depression with a hole 

58 



centered in it in one corner for 
relieving himself, a waist-high shelf 
about one foot by three feet near 
the room’s only door and ap- 
parently made of the same material 
as the walls. A pitcher and glass of 
black plastic occupied the shelf. 
They held warm water. There had 
been a food bowl on the shelf ear- 
lier. He recalled that bowl and the 
blank-faced nude male who had 
brought it — no conversation in that 
one at all. There were no windows 
in the room, just that one door and 
the toilet-depression. He heard 
water rushing under the toilet hole 
occasionally. There were water jets 
around the depression, too — they 
had turned on once, cleaning the 
area. There was no chair, only the 
floor to sit on and he had been 
stripped to the skin. He could see 
nothing in the place that might 
make a weapon. The plastic water 
pitcher and glass wouldn’t break — 
he had tried. 

His memory presented him with 
the images of other visitors, too — a 
pair of older females who had held 
him with remarkable ease while 
they examined him intimately, then 
injected something into his left but- 
tock . The area of the injection stilf 
tingled. The return of his original 
awareness from dormancy had 
begun soon after that injection, 
though. He estimated that had been 
at least three hours ago. They had 
taken his watch and he felt unsurd 
of time, but guessing at it made hint 
feel he was doing somethin! 
positive. s 

I have to escape, he told himself, j 

His weird other self, lapsing intej 
a dormancy of its own now* 
brought up memories of hordes of 

GALAXY 




nude people swarming in the tun- 
nels through which he had been 
brought to this place. It was a 
human ant hill. How could he es- 
cape through that mob?” 

The door opened and a relatively 
young woman entered. He glimpsed 
in the moment she left the door 
open an older, tougher looking fe- 
male outside, carrying one of those 
mysterious weapons that looked 
like a whip with a double end. The 
young woman had a stubble of 
black hair on her head and there 
was none of that moon-faced va- 
cancy in her features or her move- 
ments. She carried in her left hand 
what appeared to be an ordinary 
stethoscope. 

Janvert leaped to his feet as she 
entered, moved around near the 
shelf, his back to the wall. 

She seemed amused. “Relax. I’m 
just here to see how you’re taking 
all this.” She clipped the stetho- 
scope around her neck, took up the 
other end in her left hand. 

Janvert groped for the water 
pitcher without taking his attention 
from her and his hand knocked the 
pitcher from the shelf. 

“Now, look what you’ve done,” 
she said, bending to recover it. 

As she stooped Janvert brought 
his right hand down in a vicious 
chop across her neck. She fell flat 
and didn’t move. 

T HERE still was the older, 
tougher looking guard outside. 
Relax and think, Janvert told 
himself. Cool green light from a 
recessed cove around the ceiling 
washed the room, creating a death 
pallor in the skin of the woman on 
the floor. He bent over her, tried for 



a pulse, felt none. Quickly he 
recovered her stethoscope, listened 
for a heartbeat. Nothing. The 
realization that his one frantic blow 
had killed her filled him with a chill 
sense of his own perilous position. 
Moved by a sudden urgency, he 
dragged the woman’s body out of 
the way to the right of the door, 
looked back to see if he had left any 
sign of struggle. The water pitcher 
still lay there, but Janvert hesitated. 
The hesitation saved him. 

Once more the door opened and 
the older woman poked her head in- 
side. Janvert, leaping from behind 
the door, grabbed her head, yanked 
her into the cell, bringing a knee up 
into her midriff. She grunted, drop- 
ping her weapon and he released 
her, chopped her as he had the first 
one, whirled and slammed the door. 

Now he had one of their 
weapons. He recovered the odd 
whiplike object, examined it. The 
thing was black plastic, similar in 
color and texture to the pitcher and 
water glass. It was about a yard 
long with a stubby handle indented 
for fingers. There was a click- 
notched dial in the handle base and 
a yellow stud under the indentation 
for the index finger. 

Janvert pointed the double end at 
the guard he had just knocked 
down, depressed the stud. The wand 
went hap-hummmm and he 
released the stud. The humming 
stopped. The older woman had 
jerked as the weapon came alive. 
Now, the skin along her exposed 
side began to turn a dark reddish 
purple. He bent, felt for a pulse. 
Nothing. The two women were 
dead. He backed away, looked at 
the door. It opened inward, he 



PROJECT 40 



59 




knew, and there was a cupped in- 
dentation at waist height, which he 
had tried earlier. The door had re- 
fused to open then. He wondered 
now if, in his panic, he had locked 
himself in here? Desperation 
moving him, he tried the door. It 
opened immediately with only a 
faint click and he glimpsed people 
thronging past the door before he 
closed it. 

“I have to think,” he told 
himself, speaking aloud. 

They would expect him to head 
for the surface, of course. Could 
there be other ways of leaving, 
though? What lay below him? He 
knew there must be at least one 
lower level. His captors had led him 
past an open, doorless double- 
elevator shaft with bare-bones cars 
passing upward on one side and 
downward on the other. He held 
one of their weapons and he now 
knew it could kill. Hellstrom’s 
people would search for him. They 
would move room by room through 
their tunnel warren and they ob- 
viously had the manpower to be 
thorough. 

I'll go down. 

He had no idea how far under- 
ground he might be. They had 
brought him on elevators and there 
had been many floors, but his other 
self had not thought to count them. 

They had fed him something to 
make him docile, of course. That 
other self was Hellstrom’s creation. 
It might even be the answer to 
Project 40. The MIT papers could 
just be a description of something 
needed to create the chemicals for 
manipulating humans. 

The searchers wouldn’t expect 
him to go downward, though. 

60 



Keep doing the unexpected, he 
reminded himself. 

He still didn’t feel in complete 
command of himself, but he knew 
he couldn’t wait any longer. He 
held the captive weapon at the 
ready in his right hand, opened the 
door, peered out. There was less 
activity in the tunnel now, but a 
silent file of naked men and woman 
crossed in front of him from left to 
right without a single curious 
glance. Janvert counted nine in the 
group. Another longer line was 
passing in the other direction on the 
far side of the tunnel. They, too, 
ignored him. 

As they passed, Janvert slipped 
out of the cell and fell into step at 
the end of the line going left. He 
dropped back at the first elevator, 
waited for a down-car to appear, 
stepped in quickly, following the 
example of a lean, blank-faced 
male. They both faced the front of 
the car, rode silently downward. 

The smell of the place began to 
repel Janvert more and more as he 
found himself growing increasingly 
alert. The man with him in the 
elevator appeared not to notice it. 
He breathed easily, but Janvert ex- 
perienced a faint nausea every time 
he focused on the smell. Best not to 
think about it then, he warned 
himself. His partner in the elevator 
remained a figure of mysterious * 
menace, but something kept the 
man from taking special notice of 
Janvert. The man's pubic hair had 
been shaved or removed in some* 
other way. His head was shiny in its 
baldness. 

The man leaped out as the 
elevator passed another floor and 
Janvert now had the car to himself. 

GALAXY- 







He counted gray walls and floors, 
got to ten before wondering how 
long he should stay with this car. 
He glanced up at the ceiling. It was 
as featureless as the floor. Some- 
thing glistening and gray was stuck 
to the ceiling near the wall on his 
left. He reached up, touched the 
substance. Some of it clung to his 
finger and he brought it back, snif- 
fed it. The smell was that of the 
gruel in his food bowl. He rubbed it 
off on his thigh. The significance of 
food on the ceiling began to de- 
mand his attention. That ceiling 
might become a floor in the 
elevator’s return phase. The cars 
never seemed to stop. People leaped 
on and off them through the 
doorless openings. Everything 
spoke of an endless chain of cars 
circling through the levels of 
Hellstrom’s ant hill 

A BRUPTL Y the car lurched, tip- 
l ped slightly to his left. It 
lurched again, tilted more. Janvert 
kneeled against the lower edge, 
crouched there as the elevator 
turned flat on its side. Nothing but 
gray wall showed in the door 
opening as he walked the side 
around until the former ceiling be- 
came the floor, confirming his 
guess. The car was now going up. 
He leaped out at the first opening, 
found not another person in sight. 
He was in a tunnel illuminated by 
dim red light, but a brighter yellow 
glow shone at some distance to his 
fight. The tunnel stretched away 
into red gloom beyond that glow. 
He glanced left, found a gentle 
curve to the tunnel’s floor — it bent 
°ut of sight to the right. He decided 
i° head for the glow, held himself to 



a normal walking pace. He had to 
be just another occupant of this 
warren going about his normal 
business. The weapon felt heavy in 
his right hand, slippery through the 
perspiration in his palm. 

He heard the sound of running 
water before he reached the area of 
the glow, but he could see by then 
that the light came from long slits 
parallel to the floor and arched 
ceiling. The slits were at eye height 
and he had only to turn his head as 
he passed to look into a wide, low 
chamber with long tanks spaced 
through it, water running in them, 
people working with a business like 
concentration around the tanks. 
Janvert peered at the nearest tank, 
saw fish in it — little fish about six 
inches long. He saw now that the 
people farther out in the room were 
scooping fish from a tank into a 
wheeled carrier. 

A fish farm, by god! 

Janvert continued past the 
glowing slits and discovered 
another glow ahead of him now, 
this one with a distinctly pink cast. 
The light came from floor-to- 
ceiling doors which revealed a 
chamber even larger than the ear- 
lier one. This area was jammed 
with waist-high benches, lights low 
over them, plants with rich green 
leaves growing lushly from the 
benches. Again, he heard the sound 
of running water, but more faintly. 
Workers wearing dark glasses and 
carrying bags slung from their 
shoulders moved among the 
benches, harvesting red fruit that 
looked like tomatoes. Filled bags 
were being carried toward openings 
in the far wall, dumped through. 

He was encountering more 



project 40 



61 




people in the tunnel now and a 
humming sound ahead grew louder 
as he approached it. He realized he 
had been hearing that sound for 
some time now but had been 
filtering it out of his consciousness. 

So far none of the people he had 
met had paid any special attention 
to him. 

He felt that the tunnel was get- 
ting wanner as he neared that irri- 
tating humming. The sound was al- 
most painful in its intensity. He 
came presently to larger slits in the 
tunnel’s left hand wall, peered 
through them into a gigantic 
chamber. It went down at least two 
stories, up an equal distance, and 
was Filled with tall tubular objects 
that dwarfed workers moving on 
the floor far below him. He esti- 
mated that the things were at least 
fifty feet high and probably a 
hundred feet in diameter. They 
were the obvious source of the hum- 
ming and a noticeable ozone smell 
was coming through the slits into 
the tunnel. 

Electrical generators. 

But it was the biggest generator 
plant he had ever seen. It stretched 
away at least a half mile to his left 
and more than that on his right and 
looked to be at least a half-mile 
wide. He wondered what was 
driving those generators. 

Janvert answered his own 
question as he came to the far end 
of his tunnel. It turned left there 
with a double ramp. One ramp 
went down into the lighted room. 
Another, parallel to and separated 
from the First by a thin wall, slanted 
down into a gloomy area where he 
could discern the oily rush of water 
passing beneath dim lights. 



Water powered the generators. 
Was it also an escape route? 

Janvert turned purposefully 
toward the water, passed another 
File of people without a side glance. 
He emerged onto a black ledge 
beside the water. It was a damned 
river! It stretched away from him in 
the gloom and he could detect 
moving lights on the far side about 
a quarter of a mile away. 

The ledge beside the river 
decreased in width as Janvert 
moved along it below the generator 
room. He could hear the water 
under him, the muted humming on 
his left. 



T HE possible dimensions of this 
underground enterprise began 
to insinuate themselves into 
Janvert’s awareness. It was so large 
he began to suspect the government 
must be involved in it somehow. 
What other answer could there be? 
It was too big to escape notice. 
Or — was it? 

If the government had a hand in 
this, why had the Agency known 
nothing about it? The Chief had 
been privy to some of the touch- 
iest secrets in the land. Even Mer- 
rivale probably would have known 
about something this big. | 

In this questioning reverb 
Janvert almost collided with a gray* 
haired man who stood in his path at 
what appeared to be the end of the 
ledge. A spidery open stairway rose 
beyond the man. The gray-haired 
one lifted his right hand, wiggled 
the fingers oddly in front of 
Janvert’s face. 

Janvert shrugged. 

The man wiggled his Fingers once 



62 



fiALAXV 




more, shook his head from side to 
side. He was obviously puzzled. 

Janvert lifted the weapon, 
pointed it at the man. 

The other stepped backward, 
shock apparent on his face. His 
mouth was open, eyes wide and 
staring, muscles bunched defen- 
sively. Once, more he held up his 
hand, wiggled his fingers. 

“What do you want?” Janvert 
asked. 

It was as though Janvert had 
struck him. The man took another 
step backward, stopped at the edge 
of the spidery stairs. He still didn’t 
answer. 

Janvert glanced around. They ap- 
peared to be alone on this ledge and 
he could feel tension mounting. The 
hand signal obviously was supposed 
to mean something to him. The fact 
that it didn’t present a new danger. 
With abrupt decision Janvert 
flicked the firing stud on his 
weapon, heard a short baphum and 
the gray-haired man crumpled. 

Quickly Janvert dragged the 
body into the gloom at the edge of 
the ledge, hesitated. Should he 
dump the man into the river? There 
might be people downstream to see 
it and come looking for an expla- 
nation. He decided against it, 
ascended the stairs. 

They ended at a platform that an- 
chored a catwalk across the rushing 
water. Janvert struck out boldly 
across the catwalk. He felt no par- 
ticular qualms at having killed 
another denizen of Hellstrom’s 
warren. The oily movement of 
water about thirty feet below him 
and the continuing pressure of that 
fetid odor combined to produce a 
feeling of vertigo, however, and he 



guided himself with his left hand on 
the catwalk’s rail. 

The span entered a short, narrow 
tunnel at the far side of the river. A 
glowing yellow tube lit his way 
from above. A door blocked the in- 
ner end of the short tunnel. He saw 
a wheeled handle at waist height in 
its center and a green-glowing A 
above the wheel with a stylized 
symbol beside it. He took the last 
to represent part of an insect’s 
body, segmented and tapering, but 
without a head. 

Holding the weapon ready, 
Janvert applied pressure to the 
wheel with his left hand. It resisted 
him for a moment, then turned 
freely to an abrupt stop. He heaved 
outward on the wheel. The door 
gave abruptly with a soughing 
sound and he felt a breeze on the 
back of his neck. Faintly glowing 
pink light beyond the door revealed 
another tunnel. The light came 
from widely spaced overhead fix- 
tures — small flat disks. The tunnel 
slanted up at a gentle angle. 

Janvert stepped into it, sealed the 
door behind him with a spin of a 
duplicate handle on the inside. He 
began to climb.

description agrees with that of 
Janvert reported seen on Level 
Forty-eight near Turbine 
Station Six. Although this 
would indicate fugitive is going 
down in the Hive instead of up, 
matter is being investigated. 
Workers who reported the 
sighting say they thought he 



PROJECT 40 



63 




was a Leader specialist because 
of his long hair and possession 
of a stunwand. This would tend 
to confirm the sighting, but it 
still seems unusual that he 
would not try to break through 
immediately to the surface. 

J ANVERT estimated he had 
climbed almost three hundred 
feet in the narrow tunnel before he 
paused for a rest. The tunnel exe- 
cuted a sharp switchback ap- 
proximately every thousand paces 
and he estimated the slope at about 
three per cent. He guessed that the 
tunnel was a ventilator of some 
kind, but he had seen no openings 
thus far and something about the 
stillness of the place and the occa 1 
sional pockets of dust spoke of long 
disuse. Could it be an emergency 
exit? Perhaps it had been dug for 
access while larger tunnels were 
being excavated. Could it possibly 
lead to an emergency exit? He 
didn’t dare let himself hope for that 
yet. The tunnel was just taking him 
upward. 

He resumed his climb presently 
and in five more switchbacks came 
to another door with a wheeled 
handle. He stopped, looked at the 
door. What was on the other side? 
Should he pass it? He had a 
weapon. The weapon carried the 
deciding argument. He worked the 
door handle, put a shoulder to the 
door and thrust it open. Air 
soughed against his face. 

Janvert stepped out of the tunnel 
onto a narrow, railed platform 
about halfway up the wall of an im- 
mense circular and domed room. It 
stretched away from him in bright 
blue-white light for at least two 



hundred yards. The floor of the 
giant room curved slightly down- 
ward to the center and it was alive 
with men and women in a com- 
plexity of couplings. 

Janvert stared at them, frozen in 
blank astonishment. 

Breeding! 

He recalled Peruge’s astonished 
account of the night with Fancy. 
She’d called it breeding. That was 
the only word that really fitted this 
amazing scene. It excited no 
prurient interest in him. It even 
repelled him. The place carried its 
own distinctive odor — a mixture of 
perspiration and mustiness, all of it 
riding on the original stink of this 
whole warren. He noted now that 
the floor was damp and it appeared - 
resilient. Its color was blue-gray 
and it glistened. Through occa- 
sional movement at the center of 
the room he detected a wide circle 
of darker material that appeared to 
be a drain — it was grilled, by god! 
There were marks on some of the : 
flesh to show the grill pattern. 

What could be more efficient? 

Still in a partial state of shock, 
Janvert retreated back into the tun- 
nel, sealed the door, resumed his 
climb. His mind carried the wild- 
image of that room. He didn’t think} 
he would ever forget that scene.} 
Nobody would believe him, though. 
That had to be seen to be believed. 

He knew he was working against 
a background of semihysteria. So 
that's what they mean by “sexual 
congress!" 

He suspected he could have 
climbed down from his platform 
and joined the orgy without anyone 
the wiser. Just another male 
breeder.

Jan vert passed two more wheel- 
handled doors before recovering a 
semblance of mental balance. He 
looked at each door with revulsion, 
trying to imagine what he might 
find on the other side. This was a 
goddamned human hive! He stop- 
ped abruptly, frozen by the full im- 
port of that thought. 

Hive. 

He glanced around at the dimly 
lighted walls of his tunnel, sensed 
the faint humming of machinery, 
the smells, all the signs of teeming 
life around him. 

Hive! 

Jan vert took three deep, shud- 
dering breaths before resuming his 
climb. His thoughts were in tur- 
moil. It was a human hive. They 
lived here the way insects lived. 
How did insects live? They did 
things no human wanted to do — 
some things no human could do. 
They had drones and workers — and 
a queen and — they ate to live. They 
ate things that the human stomach 
would reject if the human con- 
sciousness didn’t reject it first. For 
insects breeding was just — 
breeding. The more he thought 
about it the more the pattern fitted. 
This was no secret government 
project! This was a horror, an 
abomination, a thing that needed to 
be burned out! 

Hive Security Report — 1 6- A 
Janvert: The body of a turbine 
specialist killed by stunwand 
has been found near the center 
of the Primary Watercourse. 
Janvert’s work for sure. Double 
guard has been ordered on all 
turbine inlets and screens, al- 
though no human could survive 



a trip through the power 
system. More likely he’s in the 
old construction access tunnels 
which were converted to emer- 
gency ventilation standby. 
Search concentrating there. 

J ANVERT stopped at the next 
door, pressed an ear to its sur- 
face, listening. He heard faint, 
rhythmic thumpings on the other 
side — some kind of machine, he 
guessed. A hiss accompanied the 
thumps. He released the wheel 
latch, opened the door a crack and 
peered out. The room was much 
smaller than the breeding cham- 
ber, but still big. He guessed it 
to be a hundred feet on a side. The 
ceiling was low. The only light was 
a dim red glow from tubes across 
the ceiling and it revealed stubby 
benches, each of them with a 
transparent maze of glass tubing in 
pillars at both ends. The tubing 
pulsed with fluids in brilliant 
glowing colors gnd this distracted 
him for a moment from what lay 
between the pillars on the bench 
surfaces. 

He stared at the objects, 
unwilling to believe that his eyes 
were reporting accurately. Each 
bench carriedrwhat appeared to be 
the stump of a human body from 
about the waist to the knees. Some 
were grossly male and some female. 
Among the females were a few 
whose abdomens bulged as though 
they were pregnant. Beyond waist 
and knees there was nothing that 
could be thought of as flesh — only 
that tubing with its pulsing colors. 
Could they be real? 

Janvert slipped into the room, 
touched the nearest one, a male 



PROJECT 40 



65 




stump. The flesh was warm! He 
jerked his hand away, felt vomit 
rising in his throat. He backed 
against the door to the tunnel, 
unable to take his gaze from the 
contents of this room. Those were 
live stumps of human flesh. They 
had to be! 

Movement in the room’s far 
corner caught his attention. He saw 
people parading along the benches 
there, bending, studying the 
stumps, examining the tubing. It 
was like a caricature of doctors 
doing their rounds. Janvert slipped 
back into the tunnel before he was 
seen, closed the door and stood 
there with his forehead pressed 
against the smooth, cool surface. 

Those were human reproductive 
sections. He could imagine 
Hellstrom’s hive keeping those 
monstrosities alive for breeding 
purposes. The thought of his own 
flesh subjected to such indignity 
sent shudders coursing through 
him. His back, neck and shoulders 
trembled and his knees felt inca- 
pable of supporting him. Reproduc- 
tive stumps! 

A dull thud sounded somewhere 
below him. He felt a change in the 
tunnel’s air pressure. Bare feet 
could be heard slapping the tunnel 
floor, running. 

They’re in here after me! 

Terror driving him, he jerked 
open the door, slid through the door 
shut behind him. The “medical 
procession” members noticed him 
this time, but could only jerk up- 
right in surprise before the stun- 
wand in Janvert’s hand sent them 
tumbling. He plunged through the 
nightmare room, trying not to look 
at any of the stumps. 



An arched passage went out from 
the room into a large gallery 
thronging with people. Terror still 
hounding him, he whirled left, 
shouldered through the crowd, 
pushing people aside, heedless of 
the disturbance and curiosity he ob- 
viously was arousing. Milling tur- 
moil marked his path. There were 
waving hands behind him, a few 
inarticulate outcries — one oddly 
piercing female voice called after 
him “Say there! Say there!” 

At the first elevator entrance he 
shouldered a man away from the 
opening, leaped into an upbound 
car, stared down at faces filled with 
puzzlement and alarm until the mo- 
tion of the car closed off the 
opening. 

Two women and a man shared 
the car with him. One of the women 
looked like an older version of 
Fancy, but the younger one had a 
full head of blond hair, one of the 
few he’d seen in the depths of 
Hellstrom’s hive. The man was 
completely hairless and had a nar- 
row, foxy face, brightly alert eyes — 
his expression reminded Janvert of 
Merrivale. All three showed ob- 
vious curiosity about him and the 
man bent toward him, sniffing. 
What he inhaled seemed to puzzle 
him because he sniffed again, 
deeper. 

In panic, Janvert turned the cap- 
tured weapon on him, swept its 
beam across the women. They 
slumped to the floor as the car 
passed another opening. A woman 
with heavy breasts and a round, 
blank face tried to enter, but 
Janvert kicked her in the midriff, 
sent her sprawling into people be- 
hind her. The car passed another 



66 



GALAXY 




opening without incident, another. 
Another. He dove out at the fourth 
opening into another throng of 
people, plunged through them 
across the tunnel and into a smaller 
side passage, which had attracted 
him because it was unoccupied. 
Two men he had sent sprawling 
leaped to their feet and started to 
give chase, but he dropped them 
with a burst from his weapon, fled 
again. He skidded around a corner 
to the left, another, and found 
himself back in the main gallery, 
but at least a hundred yards from 
where he had left the elevator. A 
crowd milled there — figures were 
jammed into the side passage and 
more were trying to enter it. 

Janvert turned right, holding the 
weapon upright in front of him to 
conceal it from the people behind, 
forced himself to assume a slow 
walking pace while he tried to bring 
his heaving lungs under control. As 
he moved he listened carefully for 
sounds of pursuit. He heard none. 
The sounds of general disturbance 
faded and presently he dared to 
cross the tunnel to his left, leaving it 
by a smaller right-angle passage 
that slanted steeply upward. This 
one opened within a hundred paces 
into another large cross tunnel with 
an elevator. He wove his way 
without incident through passing 
people, stepped into the first 
upbound car. The car picked up 
speed the instant he entered it. He 
glanced around — he was alone. 
Openings flashed past him. He 
counted nine, wondering if 
Hellstrom had some secret control 
of this car and had speeded it up to 
trap him. He didn’t dare try to 
leave. 



H IS panic increasing, Janvert 
moved to the doorway, 
searching for controls, but there 
were none. At last the car slowed at 
an opening. He jumped out, almost 
collided with two men guiding a 
long cart piled with what appeared 
to be yellow fabric thrown loosely 
into it. They dodged him, grinned 
and waved, their fingers moving in 
the same kind of intricate designs 
he’d seen gray-hair use beside the 
river. Janvert smiled ruefully, 
shrugged, and the pair accepted 
this, continuing to trundle their cart 
down the tunnel. 

Janvert turned away from them, 
saw that the tunnel ended shortly in 
a wide arch. Bright lights and ma- 
chinery were visible in a large room 
beyond the arch — people were 
busily working there. He entered, 
saw metal-shaping machinery on 
floor stands. He recognized a lathe, 
a stamping press of some kind (the 
ceiling had been opened above it to 
take the machine’s upper part) and 
several drill presses with men and 
women bent over them, working 
steadily, ignoring his presence. He 
caught an underlying smell of oil 
and the biting acridity of hot metal. 
The place could have been any large 
machine shop, except for the nudity 
of its personnel. Carts carrying bins 
of metal objects he could not 
identify were being pushed along 
several of the aisles between the 
machines. Janvert tried to appear 
knowledgeably busy, strode as 
directly as he could across the 
room, hoping to find an exit on the 
far side. He noted that people were 
paying a different kind of attention 
to him now and wondered why. One 
woman actually left a lathe and 



PROJECT 40 



67 




came up to sniff at his elbow. 
Janvert tried his universal shrug, 
glanced down to see perspiration 
glistening on his skin. Had his 
sweat attracted her? 

The far wall showed no opening 
and he was beginning to feel trap- 
ped when a wheeled latch in the 
wall alerted him. The door was only 
a faint line in the wall, but it opened 
outward when he worked the latch. 
He moved through the doorway as 
though he had every right there, 
sealed it behind him. The tunnel 
sloped up to his right. He listened 
for sounds to tell him whether 
others shared the tunnel — he heard 
nothing and set off upward. 

His back and legs ached with 
fatigue and he wondered how much 
more of this he could endure. His 
stomach was a region of painful 
hollowness — his mouth and throat 
were dry. Desperation drove him, 
though, and he knew he would press 
himself upward until he dropped. 
He had to escape from this mon- 
strous place.

From the Hive Manual: 
Chemical releasers which can 
evoke an exact predetermined 
response from the individual of 
any animal species must be 
very numerous and may be in- 
finite within the refined 
nuances of variation. The so- 
called “rational mind” in the 
human animal presents no in- 
surmountable obstacle to such 
a releasing process. It may be 
considered only as a threshhoid 
to be overcome. And once con- 
sciousness has been sufficiently 



depressed the releaser is freed 
to do its work. In this area, 
once considered the exclusive 
domain of instinct, we of the 
Hive are sure to develop our 
greatest unifying forces. 

H ELLSTROM stood in the 
aerie beneath a Hive-sign dis- 
play: USE EVERYTHING — WASTE 

nothing. It was past three a.m. and 
he had gone beyond wishing he 
could get a brief sleep. Now he 
prayed for rest of any kind. 

“See those changes in the air 
pressure,” an observer behind him 
said. “He’s into the emergency ven- 
tilator system again. How is he 
doing that? Quick! Send the alarm. 
Where’s the nearest search team?” 
“Why aren’t we blocking off that 
system, level by level, or at least 
every other level?” Hellstrom asked 
resignedly. 

“We only have enough teams to 
keep a ten-level guard on the 
system,” a male voice to his left 
said. 

Hellstrom peered through the 
green gloom of the aerie, trying to 
identify the speaker. Had that been 
Ed? Was he already back from 
checking the Outside patrols? 

Damn that Janvert! The man was 
diabolical in his ingenuity. Dead 
and injured workers, behavior dis- 
ruptions from the disturbance of his 
passage, the growing turmoil left in 
the wake of searchers — everything 
was conspiring to upset the entire 
Hive. Janvert was terrified, of 
course, and the chemistry of his ter- 
ror was spreading through the 
Hive. As more and more workers 
read that subtle signal from a 
human who seemed one of them 



68 



galaxy 




their unease moved like an 
outspreading wave. It alone could 
provoke a crisis. 

It had been a mistake not to 
increase Janvert’s guard as he was 
brought back to normalcy. 

My mistake, Hellstrom told 
himself bitterly. 

The chemistry of fellowship was, 
indeed, a double-edged blade. It cut 
both ways. Those guarding Jan vert 
had been lulled by it. A worker 
never attacked his fellows. 

Hellstrom listened to the ob- 
server stations coordinating this 
new turn in the search. Their hunt 
juices were up and he sensed the ex- 
citement in their voices. It was al- 
most as though they didn’t want to 
catch Janvert too soon. 

Hellstrom sighed. “Get the fe- 
male captive up here.” 

Someone in the gloom said, 
“She’s still unconscious.” 

That was Ed for sure, Hellstrom 
told himself. He said, “Well, revive 
her and get her up here.”

FORCE MANIFESTED IN OUR

AT THE eighth switchback door 
on his upward flight Janvert 
brought himself to a stumbling, 
panting halt, slumped against the 
door. He could feel its coolness 
through his hair as he pressed his 
head against it, looking down at his 
bare feet. God, it was hot in the tun- 



nel! And the stink was worse. He 
felt that he could not move another 
step without a rest. His heart was 
pounding and sweat poured from 
his body. He wondered if he dared 
venture back into the main tunnels 
and search for an elevator. He 
pressed an ear against the door, 
listened, could hear no special 
activity on the other side. This wor- 
ried him. Were they waiting there 
for him to emerge? 

Only faint sounds of machinery 
and an omnipresent sense of human 
movement came to him. An odd 
sense of almost-silence beyond this 
door, though. Again he pressed an 
ear against it, heard nothing he 
could identify as a direct menace. 

But there would be more people 
out there — these weird denizens of 
Hellstrom’s hive. How many were 
there altogether? Ten thousand? 
Not a one of them on the census 
rolls. He knew this. The whole 
place conveyed a secretive sense of 
purpose that cut across everything 
Janvert knew. These people lived by 
rules that denied everything the 
outside society believed. Did they 
have a god in here? He recalled 
Hellstrom saying grace. Sham! 
Pure sham! 

It was a damned crawling, 
revolting hive. 

The last words of Trova 
Hellstrom: The defeat of the 
Outsiders is assured by their ar- 
rogance. They defy powers 
greater than themselves. We in 
the Hive are the true creatures 
of reason. We will wait 
patiently in the manner of the

perhaps no wild Outsider will

ever understand, because the 
insects have taught us that the 
true winner in the race for sur- 
vival is the last to finish that 
race. 

J ANVERT guessed he had 
waited five minutes before fear 
overcame his fatigue. He was not 
really rested, but he had to go on. 
He was breathing more easily, but 
the ache remained in his legs. Pain 
lanced his side when he took a deep 
breath and the arches of his feet felt 
as though knives were cutting them, 
a consequence of running barefoot. 
He knew his body could take little 
more of this driving punishment be- 
fore collapse. He had to go out 
there and find an elevator. He 
straightened, intending to open the 
door and the corner of his left eye 
caught a flicker of movement down 
the tunnel. Pursuers carrying the 
doublewhip weapon rounded the 
bend below him, but their weapons 
were not raised as they climbed and 
they reacted to sighting him with a 
brief moment of shock that saved 
Janvert. His weapon had been held 
across his left arm as he reached for 
the door’s wheel latch and he had 
only to press the stud, which his 
hand did almost of itself. The 
figures below him collapsed as the 
bap-hum filled the tunnel. 

In falling, one of the pursuers 
raised a pistol and fired a shot that 
hit a light fixture and sent a searing 
shard of some shattered material 
into his cheek. His left hand, clap- 
ped reflexively against the wound, 
came away with the glittering shard 
and a bright smear of blood. 

Janvert had no way of knowing if 
the weapon in his hand worked 



through walls, but the deepest panic 
he had known thus far dictated his 
next actions. He lifted the weapon, 
depressed the stud on it and fanned 
it across the door in front of him 
before opening it. 

Six figures lay in a tangled sprawl 
beyond the door as it opened and 
one of them held a nickel-plated .45 
automatic with carved ivory grips. 
Janvert lifted it from relaxed fin- 
gers as he stepped into the room. 
He glanced around, saw what ap- 
peared to be a long, narrow bar- 
racks with triple-tiered bunks 
around the walls. The only oc- 
cupants were the six figures on the 
floor — all males, all nude, all but 
one bald and all of them breathing. 
So the weapon only knocked people 
out when a solid barrier attenuated 
its force. Janvert nodded to himself. 
He had a weapon in each hand now 
and one of them felt reassuringly 
familiar. 

Hive translation from The 
Wisdom of the Wild: The path 
to species extinction begins 
with the proud belief that in 
each individual there is a men-

sonality, spirit, anima, char- 
acter, soul or mind — and that 
this separated incarnation is 
somehow free. 

« M OW he has a gun,” 
J.^1 Hellstrom said. “That’s 
great! That’s just great. Is he a 
superman? Less than half an hour 
ago he was in the Central Breeder 
Section. I was assured we had him 
trapped there and now — now I’m 
told he has knocked out two entire 
search teams eight levels higher!”

Hellstrom sat almost at the mid- 
dle of the aerie’s observation arc, 
directly behind the observer at the 
center position. The chair he occu- 
pied was his one concession to a 
body demanding relief from its 
mounting fatigue. He had been 
active now for most of twenty-six 
hours and the aerie clock showed 
just past four a.m. 

“What are your orders?” the ob- 
server in front of him asked. 

Hellstrom stared at the ob- 
server’s head outlined against the 
glowing screen. My orders? 

“What makes anyone believe my 
orders have changed?” he asked. 
“You are to capture him!” 

“You still want him alive?” 

“More than ever. If he’s really 
this resourceful we need to mingle 
his blood with ours.” 

“He’s obviously out in the main 
tunnels again,” the observer said. 

“Of course. Tell the searchers to 
concentrate on the elevators. He’s 
had a long climb. He’ll be tired. 
Concentrate every search team in 
the upper levels along the elevators. 
Have them scan every car and 
knock out any doubtfuls. I 
know — ” Hellstrom held up a si- 
lencing hand as the observer turned 
in shocked alarm. “It can’t be 
helped.” 

“But our own — ” 

“Better we do it than leave it to 
him. Look at what he’s done. He 
obviously has his stunwand turned 
to maximum and doesn’t know 
much about it. He’s killing workers 
close up with it. I feel the same out- 
rage as all of you over this, but we 
must remember that he is panic- 
stricken and doesn’t know what 
he’s doing.” 



“He knows enough to stay out of 
our hands,” someone behind 
Hellstrom muttered. 

Hellstrom ignored the sign of dis- 
content, asked, “Where is that fe- 
male captive? I ordered her brought 
up here almost an hour ago.” 

“She had to be revived. Nils. 
They’re bringing her.” 

“Well, tell them to hurry.” 

From the Hive Manual: One of 
our strengths lies in the 
recognition of the diversity we 
gain through a unique appli- 
cation of the social behavior of 
insects as opposed to the social 
behavior evolved by the wild 
human animal. With this lesson 
ever before us we are, for the 
first time in the tong history of 
life on this planet, designing 
our own future. 

J ANVERT stood behind two fe- 
males and two males in an 
elevator carrying them upward. 
The quartet had shown disturbance 
at his entry and he had interpreted 
this as growing out of the wound on 
his cheek, A peremptory gesture 
with the gun. however, had quieted 
them, but he was left with the odd 
feeling that only the gesture, not the 
gun, had elicited the response. To 
test this, he tucked the automatic 
under his right arm when one of the 
men turned. Jan vert waved a palm 
at the man. It was as though 
Janvert had said. Turn around and 
leave me alone. The man turned, 
wiggled his fingers at his com- 
panions and all of them ignored 
Janvert from that point. 

He had the hang of the elevators 
now. You stood to the bade in these 



PROJECT 40 



71 




upper-level cars. The act of step- 
ping forward slowed them at a 
passing floor. There was a critical 
area near the doorway that 
operated an invisible sensor. 

One of the women glanced back 
at him presently, nodded at the 
doorway passing a blank gray wall. 
Last stop coming up? The others 
moved forward in a body. Janvert 
readied himself to join them, lifting 
the captured wand in his left hand. 
As he moved, the first thin edge of 
the opening gaped above him. The 
car slowed and he saw a cluster of 
bare legs, two weapons pointing in 
at the elevator car. 

Janvert depressed the stud on his 
own weapon, fanned it across the 
opening as it deepened. He caught 
his fellow passengers as well as 
those outside. He leaped over the 
passengers, spraying his weapon 
right and left in a humming arc of 
destruction, ran down the tunnel to 
the right, partly on the cold floor, 
partly on fallen flesh still warm 
under his feet. 

As he ran he heard a gushing 
crunch behind him, glanced back 
without breaking stride. One of his 
fellow passengers had fallen with 
head across the door opening. The 
upward surging car had left a head 
on the floor rolling in a patch of 
gore. 

Janvert turned away, finding it 
odd that he felt nothing at all about 
this. Nothing at all. That denizen of 
this hive had been dead already, 
killed by one of his own kind’s 
weapons. It made no difference 
what was done to the body after 
that. No difference at all. 

Continuing to depress the firing 
stud for short bursts of humming. 



Janvert trotted down the tunnel, 
clearing a path as he went. In this 
way he rounded a bend, caught 
another group of elevator-watchers. 
They collapsed as he burst upon 
them, but a new group was running 
toward him far down the tunnel 
ahead and Janvert heard the distant 
thrumming of their weapons. Ob- 
viously they were out of range. He 
lifted the automatic, emptied it into 
this group, dodged into the first 
up-car, rode it two floors be- 
fore emerging into another tunnel 
where the opening had been left 
unguarded. 

Janvert dodged hurrying figures 
to cross this tunnel, entered another 
sharply slanted upramp, which he 
abandoned at the first doorway on 
his right. This led into another hy- 
droponics garden full of harvesters. 
He recognized tomatoes and hurled 
the empty automatic at a worker 
who ran toward him, protesting the 
intrusion. He ran, firing the cap- 
tured stunweapon ahead and to 
both sides. Tomatoes splashed on 
the floor from tumbling harvest 
sacks and he spattered their red 
pulp over his feet and legs as he 
skidded through them. His chest 
was one big band of flame, his 
throat dry and painful, his body al- 
most ready to quit. 

A series of small openings be- 
came visible in the far wall of the 
hydroponics room as he ap- 
proached. They were about chest 
height and he could see sacked 
produce whisking upward — then 
baskets, bins. He recognized ber- 
ries, what appeared to be deep 
green cucumbers, stringbeans . 

A dumbwaiter system! 

Shoulders sagging, he came to a 



72 



GALAXY 




halt, stared at the wall. He could- 
see no door along its entire length — 
only these openings with produce 
whipping upward. There were flat 
shelves on a conveyor — some of 
them came past him empty. 
Containers went onto the shelves. 
The openings were about three feet 
square and the moving shelves 
didn’t appear to be much larger. 
Could he get up in there and onto 
one of those shelves? They moved 
upward at a frightening speed. He 
could hear sounds of tumult 
growing in the tunnel behind him. 
What other chance did he have? He 
couldn’t go back. 

Janvert summoned a small 
reserve of strength, backed off 
several steps and watched for an 
empty carrier. When it appeared he 
dove for the opening, rolling 
himself into a ball around the 
weapon clutched in his hands. The 
instant his head entered the 
opening, the carrier slowed and he 
landed hard. The shelf swayed 
under him, but he compressed 
himself into a fetal ball, managed 
to stay aboard. His left shoulder 
rubbed the back wall as the carrier 
gathered speed and he left a trail of 
skin before he could jerk away. He 
peered up and around. 

The dumbwaiter system operated 
in a long slot between gray walls, an 
area illuminated only by light from 
the feeder openings. He could make 
out many carriers moving swiftly 
upward around him and an acrid 
fruit smell overrode all the other 
stenches. He passed more openings, 
glimpsed a startled face at one — a 
woman carrying a basket piled 
high with yellow fruit that looked 
like tiny pumpkins. Janvert peered 



up, trying to find out how the 
system terminated. Did it disgorge 
into chopping machinery? Was 
there a bloody mincer arrange- 
ment up there — or a sorting system, 
conveyors? 

A WIDE line of light was be- 
. coming visible far above him 
and he could hear the increasing 
roar of machinery. It drowned out 
the whistling, clanking, hissing of 
the conveyor he was riding. The line 
of light was nearer . nearer . 
He tensed himself and was caught 
by surprise as a trip system tipped 
his shelf at the top of the lift, 
dumping him into a bin piled high 
with yellow carrots. 

Clutching the bin’s top with his 
left hand, Janvert righted himself, 
clambered over the edge into a 
room of long, waist-high troughs 
flowing with bubbling pulp of many 
colors. Workers moved all through 
the area dumping bins of produce 
into the troughs. 

It was easily six feet to the floor 
and Janvert landed with a slippery 
squishing that sent him lurching 
into a female who had come up to 
the conveyor outlet with an empty 
bin on wheels. Janvert’s momentum 
sent her sprawling. He kept her 
down with a burst from his weapon, 
charged forward, slipping and skid- 
ding. There was pulped tomato on 
his feet and the floor itself carried a 
skimming of multicolored debris 
from the processing, which 
continued all around him. 

He passed another group before 
reaching a doorway, but their food- 
spattered appearance differed little 
from his and they paid no attention 
to him. Janvert plunged through the 



PROJECT 40 



73 




opening, was hit by a cold shock of 
water spraying from overhead noz- 
zles. He gasped, splashing through 
the water, and was almost clean 
when he emerged on the far side 
and through another doorway into 
a wide, dimly lighted tunnel. Water 
was draining off him, off the cap- 
tured weapon in his hand. It 
collected in a puddle under him, but 
he saw similar puddles all around. 

Janvert glanced left — the long 
vista of a tunnel stretched there, but 
he saw few people and none of them 
appeared interested in him. He 
looked to his right, saw a spidery 
stairway similar to the one at the 
underground river. The stairs led up 
into gloom and that had to be his 
direction. Janvert turned, slogged 
toward the stairs,- began climbing, 
drawing himself up by sliding his 
left hand on the rail and pulling. 
His mouth was hanging open with 
fatigue and the aftermath of that 
shocking shower. 

At the fifth rung on the stairs he 
saw legs appear at the top. He fired 
his weapon upward without 
pausing, kept it humming as he 
climbed the remaining steps. Five 
sprawled figures lay on a platform 
where the stairs ended. He limped 
around them, his gaze fastened on a 
door beyond. The door had only a 
bar latch, which he lifted. The 
hinges were on the inside to the 
right. He pulled the bar. The door 
creaked open, revealing a dank 
dirty passage and the upthrusting 
roots of a tree stump which the 
door’s movement had pushed out- 
ward and down. Janvert dragged 
himself past the stump into star- 
lighted darkness, heard the door 
creaking shut behind him. The 



stump tipped back into its con- 
cealing position as he cleared it, 
closing with only a faint thump. 

Janvert stood shivering in cold 
night air. 

It took him a moment to realize 
that he had escaped from 
Hellstrom’s madhouse human hive. 
He peered upward — stars. No 
doubt of it — he was outside. But 
where? The starlight gave him few 
clues to his surroundings. He could 
see a faint suggestion of trees 
directly ahead. He groped for the 
stump that masked the exit. His fin- 
gers encountered a hard surface, 
which a fingernail told him was real 
wood. His eyes were adjusting, 
though, and escape from the tun- 
nels had tapped a source of energy 
he hadn’t known existed. There was 
a faint glow in the sky slightly to his 
left and he guessed that would be 
Fosterville. He tried to recall the 
distance. Ten miles? His over- 
worked body would never make 
that on bare feet. The area in front 
of him appeared to be a grassy 
slope with dark spots in it. 

M OST of the water had dried 
from his body, but he still 
trembled with the cold. He knew he 
couldn’t delay here any longer. 
Those bodies behind him would be 
found. Hellstrom’s people would be 
out here after him all too soon. He 
had to put distance between himself 
and that camouflaged exit. No mat? 
ter how he did it, he had to get back 
to civilization and tell what he had 
seen. r 

Taking the sky glow as his com- 
pass point, Janvert set out down the 
slope. He clutched the captured 
weapon in his right hand. This thing 



74 



galaxy 




was his passport to belief when he 
told his story. A demonstration of 
this weapon on a convenient animal 
would silence all doubt. 

The rough ground hurt his bare 
feet, caught his toes with unseen 
rocks and roots. He stumbled, hob- 
bled, ran full into a low wooden 
fence and fell across it into the dust 
of a narrow road. 

Janvert picked himself up, 
studied what he could see of the 
road in the starlight. It appeared to 
angle down to his left in the general 
direction of the skyglow. He turned 
in that direction, stumbled down 
the dusty track, panting, not trying 
to be quiet. He was too worn out. 
The road dipped into a shallow 
swale and he lost the skyglow for a 
moment, but had it again at the 
next gentle rise. 

The dust kicked up by his feet 
tickled his nose. A breeze like a 
feather touched his right cheek, his 
arm, his bare flank. The track dip- 
ped once more and turned gently to 
the right into a deeper darkness 
which suggested trees. He missed 
part of the turn, stubbed the little 
toe of his left foot against the edge 
of a rut. He hissed a curse, kneeled 
and gripped the injured member 
until the pain eased. As he crouched 
he saw a sudden flickering of light 
in the deepest darkness directly 
ahead. Reflexively he brought up 
the captured weapon, pointed it and 
fired — a single humming burst. 

The light vanished. 

He straightened, groped his way 
forward, his left hand outstretched, 
the weapon held close to his right 
side. The outstretched hand was too 
high to meet the next obstruction 
a nd he fell across a cold metallic 



surface, the weapon scraping it with 
a noisy clatter that froze him for 
the moment it took him to realize 
he was sprawled half across the 
hood of a car. 

A car! 

He eased himself back, skinned 
his elbow on a hood ornament, then 
guided himself with his free hand 
around the left side of the car. At 
the window his fingers explored an 
open crack at the top and he 
smelled tobacco smoke. He tried to 
peer through the glass, but could 
see nothing. A rhythmic wheezing 
came from inside. He groped for 
the door handle, jerked the door 
open with a startling flash of light 
from the automatic switch. The 
light revealed two men in business 
suits, neat white shirts and ties, 
slumped unconscious in the front 
seat. The driver held a cigarette — it 
was smoldering and charring a 
circle in the left leg of his pants. 
Janvert took the cigarette, dropped 
it in the dust by his feet and crushed 
out the burning cloth with one 
hand. 

The man lighting a cigarette — 
that had been the flicker of light at 
which he had fired. This weapon 
didn’t kill from a distance, then. 
Walls and distance made it less 
than fatal — and it obviously had a 
limited range beyond that. 

Janvert shook the driver’s 
shoulder, got only a lolling head for 
response. They were out cold. The 
movement opened the man’s coat, 
though, revealed a shoulder holster 
and a snubnosed magnum pistol. 
Janvert took the gun, saw the radio 
beneath the dash. 

These could not be Hellstrom’s 
people. These were cops.

What the Drone said (Hive 
axiom j: You Outsiders! It’s 
your children we’re after, not 
you! We’ll get them, too, over 
your dead bodies. 

<< TTOW can he be outside?” 
XX Hellstrom demanded, out- 
rage amplifying the sudden surge of 
fear that swept over him. He 
whirled from the dark north end of 
the gloomy aerie, strode across the 
room to the female at the observer 
console who had called out to him. 

“He is,” she said. “See! There!” 
She pointed to the screen glowing 
with green brilliance in front of her. 
The screen showed Janvert’s figure, 
it’s outline shimmering in the scat- 
tered radiation of night-vision pro- 
jection. Janvert was creeping along 
a dusty road. 

“That’s the north perimeter,” 
Hellstrom whispered, recognizing 
the outline of the landscape beyond 
Janvert. “How did he get out 
there?” Reluctant admiration for 
this incredible male warred in 
Hellstrom with a swelling rage. 
Janvert was Outside! 

“We’re getting reports of a 
disturbance at Level Three,” an ob- 
server at Hellstrom’s left called. 

“He’s found one of the hidden 
doors out of Level Three,” 
Hellstrom said. “How did he get 
that far? He’ll be at that car with its 
watchers in seconds! The car’s right 
down in those trees.” He pointed at 
the screen. “Have the watchers 
heard him yet?” 

“We have a pursuit team out 
after him,” an observer on the left 



called. “They’ll be a few minutes, 
though. They were on Five and we 
routed them through the upper 
exits.” 

The observer in front of 
Hellstrom said, “I got an in- 
terference flash just before I saw 
him, as though he’d used his 
weapon. Could he have knocked 
out the watchers in that car?” 

“Or killed them,” Hellstrom 
said. “Poetic justice if he did. 
Who’s observing that car?” 

“The team was pulled back an 
hour ago to help search for the es- 
caped captive,” someone behind 
him said. 

Hellstrom nodded. Of course! 
He’d given the order himself. 

“There hasn’t been any con- 
versation in that car for some 
time,” the observer just to his left 
said. “I have the pickup in the tree 
above the car.” The observer tap- 
ped the shiny ivory plugyin her right 
ear. “I can heap^-Janvert ap- 
proaching — the watchers in the car 
seem to be unconscious. They’re 
wheezing the way Outsiders always 
do when you stun them heavily.” 

“Maybe it’s a break for us at 
last,” Hellstrom said. “How far 
away is the pursuit team?” 

“Five minutes at the most,” 
someone behind him said. 

“Get backup squads out onto the 
rangeland between him and the 
town,” Hellstrom said. “Just in 
case.” 

“What about the other 
watchers?” the observer in front of 
him asked. 

“Tell our workers not to attract 
attention to themselves. Devil take 
that Janvert — the Hive needs 
breeders that resourceful.”

How had the man escaped from 
the Hive? 

The observer on his left said, 
“He’s almost at the car.” 

Another farther down the arc 
called out, "Here’s the report on 
how he got out.” She turned, her 
face in eerie sidelight from the 
screens, told him briefly what the 
cleanup teams had found at Level 
Three. 

He rode a food conveyor! 
Hellstrom thought. 

The Outsider took risks no ordi- 
nary worker would dream of 
taking. The implications in that 
would have to be considered more 
thoroughly — later. 

“The captive female,” Hellstrom 
said. “Has she been shown what 
will happen to her if she fails?” 

Someone behind him spoke with 
obvious distaste, “She’s been 
shown, Nils.” 

Hellstrom nodded. They didn’t 
like this, of course. He didn’t like it 
himself. But it was necessity and all 
of them could see that now. 

“Bring her in here,” Hellstrom 
said. 

They had to drag her into the 
range of the dim lights at the 
observation screens and then hold 
her upright when they stopped. 

Hellstrom suppressed his own re- 
vulsion, spoke slowly and distinctly 
as though to a newly hatched 
child — and all the time he felt that 
he was sacrificing himself for the 
Hive. 

“Clovis Carr,” he said. “That is 
the name you give us. Do you still 
identify with it?” 

She stared through the gloom at 
the greenish death pallor of 
Hellstrom’s skin. This is a 



nightmare, she told herself. I’ll 
wake up and find out it's all been a 
nightmare. 

Hellstrom saw the recognition 
the use of her name aroused. He 
said, “In a moment. Miss Carr, 
your friend Janvert will come 
within range of a remote speaker 
we have out there.” He pointed to 
the screen. “I will attract Mr. 
Janvert’s attention then and it will 
be up to you to get him back here if 
you can. I deeply regret that we 
must cause you this mental an- 
guish, but you can see the necessity. 
Will you try?” 

She nodded, her face a pale mask 
of terror in the green light. Try? 
Sure? Play right along with the 
nightmare. 

“Very good,” Hellstrom said. 
“You must think in a positive way, 
Miss Carr. You must think success. 

I believe you can do this.” 

Again she nodded, but it was as 
though she had no conscious con- 
trol over her muscles. 

From the Hive Manual: The 
society itself must be 
considered as living material. 
The same ethics and morality 
that concern us when we in- 
terfere with the sacred flesh of 
an individual cell must concern 
us equally wheh we intrude into 
the processes of the society. 

J ANVERT was reaching for the 
radio microphone, hardly be- 
lieving he had that token of civiliza- 
tion within his grasp, when a voice 
boomed at him from high over his 
right shoulder. 

“Janvert.” 

He jerked back, slamming the 



PROJECT 40 



77 




door to shut off the car’s dome 
light, dodged to the front of the ve- 
hicle and crouched there, pointing 
his weapon up into the darkness. 

The voice came again: “Jan vert, I 
know you can hear me.” 

It was up there in the trees, but 
they were too dark to show any de- 
tail to Janvert. He found himself 
locked in indecision. He had been a 
fool to let the dome light show. 

“I am speaking to you through a 
remote system, Janvert,” the voice 
said. “There is an electronic device 
in the trees near you. It will pick up 
your answer and transmit it to me. 
You must answer me now.” 

A loudspeaker! 

Janvert still crouched in silence. 
It was a trick. They wanted him to 
speak just to locate him. 

“We have someone here who 
wants to speak to you,” the voice in 
the trees said. “Listen carefully, 
Janvert.” 

At first Janvert failed to recog- 
nize the new voice issuing from the 
speaker. There was a throat- 
strained quality in the words, as 
though each required superhuman 
effort. The voice was a woman’s, 
though, and at last she said, “Ed- 
die! It’s Clovis. Please answer me!” 

Clovis was the only one who 
called him Eddie. The others all 
used that hated Shorty. He stared 
up through the darkness at the hid- 
den speaker. Clovis? 

“Eddie,” she said. “If you don’t 
come back they’re going to take me 
down to a — a place where — where 
they — cut off your legs and the 
rest — ” she was sobbing now — 
“your legs and the rest of your body 
at the waist and . Oh, God! Ed- 
die, I’m so frightened. Eddie! 



Please answer me! Please come 
bade!” 

Janvert recalled that room of 
stumped bodies, the multicolored 
tubes, the hideously accentuated 
sexuality. Abruptly he experienced 
flashing memory — the severed head 
on the tunnel floor, the gore, his 
own feet trampling through red 
fruit, his body spattered with . 

He doubled over, vomited. 

Clovis’s voice went on and on, 
pleading with him. 

“Eddie, please, can you hear me? 
Please! Don’t let them do that to 
me. Oh, God! Why doesn’t he 
answer?” 

I can’t answer her, Janvert 
thought. 

But he had to respond. He had to 
do something. The air was full of 
the nauseating smell of his own 
vomit and his chest ached, but his 
head felt cleared. He straightened, 
supporting himself with a hand on 
the car’s hood. 

“Hellstrom!” he called. 

“Right here.” 

“How can I trust you?” Janvert 
asked. He started working his way 
back to the car’s door. He had to 
get to that radio. 

“We will harm neither you nor 
Miss Carr if you return,” 
Hellstrom said. “We do not lie 
about such things, Mr. Janvert. 
You will be placed under necessary 
restraints, but neither of you will be 
harmed. We will permit the two of 
you to associate and have any rela- 
tionship you wish, but if you do not 
return to us immediately, we will 
carry out our threat. We will do so 
with the deepest regret, but we will 
do it. Our own attitudes toward a 
procreative stump are much dif-

ferent from yours, Mr. Janvert. 
Believe me,” 

“I believe you,” Janvert said. He 
was at the car’s door now, hesi- 
tating. If he opened the door and 
grabbed for the microphone, what 
would they do up there? They must 
have searchers out here by now. 
They had that speaker in the tree. 
They had some way of knowing 
what he was doing. He had to take 
precautions. He lifted the captured 
weapon, intending to spray the area 
around him randomly before 
opening the door. He didn’t allow 
himself to think about Clovis. But 
that room . His finger on the 
firing stud refused to move. That 
room with the stubs of bodies! 
Again he felt nausea clutching him. 

Clovis could still be heard over 
the speaker. She was crying 
somewhere in the bade ground, sob- 
bing and calling his name. “Ed- 
die — Eddie — Eddie — please help 
me. Make it stop — ” 

Janvert closed his eyes. What can 
Ido? 

As the thought pulsed in his mind 
he felt a tingling on his back and 
right side, heard a distant humming 
that followed him all the way down 
to the dusty ground beside the car, 
but he no longer heard it by the 
time he was stretched in the dust.

From the Hive Manual: Pro- 
tective resemblance has always 
been a major key to our sur- 
vival. This is shown by the oral 
tradition as well as the earliest 
written records we have 
preserved. The mimicry our 
ancestors learned from insects 



helps to protect us from the at- 
tacks of the wild Outsiders. 
Observation of insects tells us, 
however, that the survival value 
of this device remains low 
techniques, which we must con- 
bine it with many other tech- 
niques and especially with new 
techniques, which we must con- 
stantly search out. To spur us 
on the way we must think al- 
ways of Outsiders as predators. 
They will attack us if they find 
us. They are sure to find us 
some day and we must prepare 
for this. Our preparation must 
include both defensive and of- 
fensive characteristics. In of- 
fensive weapons let us always 
keep the insect as our model — 
the weapon must condition any 
attacker against repeating acts 
of violence against us. 

T HE vibration of the Hive 
began somewhere far below the 
aerie and reached upward and out- 
ward with shock waves that would 
register on seismic recorders all 
around the planet. When it stopped, 
Hellstrom thought, Earthquake! It 
was a fearful prayer in his mind, 
however, not a recognition. Let it 
be an earthquake and not the 
destruction of Project 40! 

He had just begun to relax from 
the recapture of Janvert not twenty 
minutes ago when the vibration 
began. 

The aerie stopped creaking and a 
moment of abnormal silence 
followed, as though all of the 
workers of the Hive held their 
breath simultaneously. In that 
moment Hellstrom moved through 
the aerie’s gloom, noting that the 



PROJECT 40 



79 




lights still functioned, the screens 
still glowed. 

He said, “Damage reports, 
please. Somebody get me Saldo.” 
The note of calm command in his 
voice surprised himself. 

They had Saldo on a screen at the 
right side of the arc within seconds. 
Hellstrom could see a section of a 
wide gallery behind Saldo, dust set- 
tling there. 

“They held me,” Saldo greeted 
him. The younger man looked 
shocked and just the smallest 
amount cowed. One of the big 
symbiotes who attended the Re- 
searchers moved in behind Saldo 
then, thrust him aside. The scarred, 
ebony features of a Researcher 
filled the screen. A pink palm came 
up in front of the face and the fin- 
gers winked in Hive-sign. 

Hellstrom translated aloud for 
those who could not see the screen. 

We do not appreciate the distrust 
represented by your sending an ob- 
server with orders to delay the 
power connection for our project. 
Let the alarm which we know you 
felt be a small sign of our dis- 
pleasure. We could have warned 
you to expect it, but your behavior 
did not deserve such a warning. Re- 
call the resonance we all felt in the 
Hive and rest assured that the effect 
was of an order many thousands of 
times greater at the locus of our 
projected impulse. Project 40, ex- 
cept for some small refinements, 
which may include damping the 
local feedback, can be judged a 
complete success. 

“Where was the locus of your 
projection?” Hellstrom asked. 

In the Pacific Ocean near the is- 
lands the Outsiders call Japan. 



They will observe a new island there 
shortly. 

The big face moved out of the 
screen’s range to be replaced by 
Saldo. 

“They restrained me,” Saldo 
protested. “They held me and 
ignored my orders. They connected 
the power and wouldn’t let me call 
you. They disobeyed you. Nils!” 

Hellstrom flashed a Calm-your- 
self. sign and, as Saldo fell silent, 
said, “Complete the loose ends of 
your observation, Saldo. Assemble 
a complete fact sheet, including 
development time for the refine- 
ments they mention, then report to 
me personally in full.” He signaled 
to close the communication, turned 
away. 

The Hive had its defensive-of- 
fensive weapon, then, but with it 
came many other problems. The 
crisis disturbance which had spread 
all through the Hive had left its 
mark on the Researchers. Their or- 
dinary irritability had been ampli- 
fied into a form of revolt. There 
was damage to the Hive’s interde- 
pendence system. This might buy 
the Hive time to recover, though. 
Whatever else, it needed long 
periods of undisturbed time most of 
all. The big changes devoured great 
blocs of time. He could see this in 
himself when he compared himself 
to the New Breed. Hellstrom held 
few illusions about himself. He 
really preferred to vocalize and 
Hive-sign always represented a 
strain on him, but for some of the 
New Breed, this pattern was 
reversed. For himself, Hellstrom 
knew he took an unhealthy en- 
joyment in the possession of a dis- 
tinct name and Outsider-like 



80 



GALAXY 




identity, but most of the Hive’s 
workers were free of this bondage. 

I am a transitional form, he told 
himself, and some day I will be 
obsolete. 

From the Hive Manual: 
Freedom represents a concept 
tied inextricably to the dis- 
credited abstract of indi- 
vidualism/ego. We sacrifice 
none of this freedom to gain 
our more efficient, reliable and 
convenient basic human stock. 

ERR1VALE stood on the 
balcony outside his second- 
floor motel room, waiting for day- 
light. The air was cold, but he had 
dressed in a Highlands-made gray 
woolen sweater with a high turtle- 
neck. It was thick enough to protect 
him even when he leaned against 
the iron balustrade. He puffed 
thoughtfully on a cigarette, lis- 
tening to nightsounds. There were 
distant footsteps out in the parking 
lot and a murmur of voices rose 
from a room down the balcony, 
where a light had come on a few 
minutes ago. 

A door below him opened, 
sending yellow light in a great 
splashing fan across the courtyard 
to the blue edge of the swimming 
pool. A man strode out into the 
light, peered upward. 

Merrivale, looking over the rail, 
recognized Gammel and expected 
the FBI man might have a report 
on the earth shock. The quake — a 
distant rumbling that had filled his 
room with primitive fears — had 
awakened Memvale almost forty- 
five minutes earlier. Gammel had 
already been awake and in the 



room downstairs they were using as 
a command post. 

Merrivale had had him on the 
house telephone in a few seconds, 
demanding, “What was that?” 

“Felt like an earthquake. We’re 
checking out whether there was any 
damage. You okay?” 

Merrivale had turned on his 
bedside light. There was power at 
least. After a glance around his 
room: ‘Yes, I’m fine. Doesn’t seem 
to be any damage here at all.” 

Some of the motel’s other tenants 
had been on the balcony and in the 
courtyard when Merrivale went out 
after dressing, but most had 
returned to their rooms by now. 

Gammel, recognizing Merrivale 
on the balcony, motioned for him 
to come down, said, “Hurry it up.” 
Something’s gone wrong, Mer- 
rivale thought. He stubbed out his 
cigarette, crushed it underfoot and 
headed down the balcony toward 
the stairs. There was something 
tensely alarming in Gammel’s 
manner. 

Merrivale made it down to the 
first-floor room in a swift ten 
seconds, taking the stairs two at a 
time, not bothering about noise. He 
plunged through the door Gammel 
was holding open from the inside, 
heard the door slam behind him. 

It wasn’t until he was fully into 
the room and saw the three men 
clustered around a table that held a 
radio transceiver and a telephone 
with the receiver off the hook that 
Merrivale began to get a full sense 
of how truly wrong things had gone. 

A bed stood against the wall be- 
hind the table, its covers thrown off 
and dragged part way into the 
room. An ashtray had fallen off the 




PROJECT 40 



81 




table and lay ignored in its spilled 
contents. One of the men around 
the table still wore pajamas, al- 
though Gammel and the others 
were fully dressed. Light came from 
two floor lamps which had been 
pulled close to the table. All the 
men, including Gammel, were 
focusing in some way on the 
telephone with its receiver off. Two 
were actually staring at the phone. 
The man in pajamas was looking 
from the phone to Merrivale, back 
to the phone, up to Merrivale. 
Gammel was pointing at the 
instrument while he glared at 
Merrivale. 

“Damn it to hell — they knew our 
number!” Gammel blared. 

“What?” Merrivale was taken 
aback by the accusatory tone. 

“We had that phone put in late 
yesterday,” Gammel explained. 
“It’s a private line.” 

“I don’t understand,” Merrivale 
said. He studied Gammel’s rocky 
lace, seeking a clue to this odd 
conversation. 

“It was Hellstrom calling us,” 
Gammel said. “He says he has one 
of your people with him and — do 
you have an Eddie Jan vert?” 

“Shorty? Shorty led the team 
that — ” Gammel put a hand to lips 
to shut him off. 

MeiTivale nodded. 

Gammel said, “Hellstrom tells 
me we’d better listen to your man 
or they will blow this town and half 
the state of Oregon off the planet.” 

“What!” 

“He says that wasn’t an earth- 
quake we all felt. It was some 
weapon he claims can rip the planet 
apart. How trustworthy is your 
man Janvert?” 



Merrivale answered him auto- 
matically, “Completely.” Imme- 
diately he wished he had not said 
that. It had been a thoughtless 
response to a question that de- 
manded he defend the Agency’s ca- 
pabilities. Janvert might not be 
completely trustworthy — or it 
might be necessary to show doubt 
of actual trustworthiness. Too late 
now, though. His answer had trap- 
ped him, reduced the range of 
possible responses. 

“Janvert is on that phone and 
wants to talk to you,” Gammel 
said. “He tells me he can verify 
Hellstrom’s threat and that he can 
explain why one of our cars is 
failing to respond on the radio.” 

Merrivale stalled for time to 
assess the situation. “I thought you 
told me the phone to the farm was 
out of order. Are they calling from 
the farm?” 

“As far as we know. One of my 
men is out right now trying to work 
a trace. Hellstrom apparently had 
the phone fixed himself or it — ” 

“And one of your cars fails to 
respond?” 

“Janvert says our people are 
merely unconscious, but he refused 
to say why or explain. He insisted 
we get you first. I told him you 
might be asleep, but — ” Gammel 
nodded at the telephone. 

Merrivale swallowed in a dry 
throat. Blow up half the state? Pop- 
pycock! He crossed to the phone 
with as much confidence as he 
could muster, picked it up, spoke in 
his best British accent. “Merrivale 
here.” 

Gammel moved to a tape 
recorder spinning away behind the 
transceiver, jacked an earphone 



82 



GALAXY 




into it, listened while nodding for 
Merrivale to continue. 

7 ’HATS old Jolly vale all right, 
Janvert thought as he heard the 
voice. Wonder why they sent him ? 
Clovis stood directly across from 
Janvert, still frightened, but no 
longer sobbing. He found it odd 
that her nudity didn’t excite him. 

Janvert nodded to Hellstrom, 
who stood a pace away in the 
gloomy room above the barn- 
studio. Hellstrom’s face appeared 
deathly pale in the green light which 
came from banks of what appeared 
to Janvert as TV screens. 

“Tel! him,” Hellstrom said. 
Merrivale’s voice was being 
broadcast to the entire aerie room 
from a speaker on the control bank. 

“Hello, Joe,” Janvert said, de- 
liberately using Merrivale’s first 
name for the first time. “This is Ed- 
die Janvert. I’m sure you recognize 
my voice, but I’ll identify myself 
further if you want. I’m the one you 
gave the President’s Signal Corps 
number and code to, remember?” 
Damn him! Merrivale thought, 
resenting that admission as much as 
the familiar tone and use of his first 
name. It was Janvert, though. No 
doubt of it. 

“Tell me what is going on,” Mer- 
rivale said. 

“Unless you want this whole 
planet to become one giant morgue 
you’d better listen carefully to what 
I tell you and you’d better believe 
me,” Janvert said. 

“Now, see here, Shorty,” Mer- 
rivale said. “What’s all this 
nonsense they’ve been telling me 
about blowing up — ” 

“You shut up and listen!” 



Janvert snapped. ‘You hear me? 
Hellstrom has a weapon that makes 
an atom bomb look like a child’s 
popgun. Those guys in the car, 
those FBI agents your buddy was 
worried about— they were knocked 
out by a little hand version of this 
weapon. That hand-held weapon 
can kill people at a distance or just 
knock them out. Believe me, I’ve 
seen it. Now, you — ” 

“Shorty,” Merrivale interrupted, 
“I think you’d better let me come 
up there and — ” 

“Oh, you’ll come up here all 
right,” Janvert said. “But if you 
have any doubts, get rid of them. 
And if you try to attack this place 
again — well, if I even suspect you 
might do that, I’m going to use that 
number and code you gave me and 
I’m going to oil the President to 
give him a full — ” 

“Now, Shorty! Your government 
wouldn’t — ” 

“Screw the government! Hell- 
strom’s weapon is zeroed in right 
now on the Capitol. They’ve al- 
ready demonstrated its effec- 
tiveness. Why don’t you check 
that?” 

“Check what? That little earth- 
quake we — ” 

“The new island off the coast of 
Japan,” Janvert said. “Hellstrom’s 
people have a tap on the Pentagon’s 
satellite teletype relay. They know 
about it and there’s a seismic sea 
wave warning all around the Pacific 
Basin already.” 

“What in the bloody hell are you 
talking about, Shorty?” Merrivale 
demanded. As he spoke Merrivale 
bent over the table, clawed a 
notepad and pencil into position, 
scrawled: Gammel — check that! 



PROJECT 40 



83 




Gammel bent to read the note, nod- 
ded, pointed it out to another agent 
and then whispered an explanation. 

Janvert was talking again, his 
voice coming out clear and precise 
as though he were trying to explain 
something to a disobedient child. “I 
warned you to listen carefully,” 
Janvert said. “Hells trom’s farm is 
just one tiny extrusion from a giant 
complex of tunnels. Those tunnels 
spread out to hell and gone and 
they go down more than five thou- 
sand feet. They are lined with a spe- 
cial concrete which Hellstrom says 
is proof against a fission bomb. I 
believe him. There are some fifty 
thousand people living in these tun- 
nels. Believe me — please believe 
me.” 

Merrivale found his attention 
caught by the spinning reels on 
Gammel’s tape recorder, lifted his 
gaze to meet a look of shock in the 
SAIC’s eyes. 

Merrivale thought: Bloody hell! 
If Shorty’s right this isn't a job for 
us — it’s a job for the military. 
Somehow Shorty was to be 
believed. It just wasn’t possible that 
a statement so shocking could be 
false. Merrivale bent to the 
notepad, wrote: Call Army. 

Glancing at the words, Gammel 
hesitated, then motioned another of 
his aids to read it and obey. The 
aide looked at the pad, stared ques- 
tioningly at Gammel, who nodded 
vigorously to reinforce the com- 
mand, then motioned for the man 
to bend close. Gammel whispered 
for a moment and the aide’s face 
paled. He dashed out of the room. 

“As unbelievable as your story 
sounds,” Merrivale said, “I will 
take your word for it at the 



moment. However, you must know 
what I will have to do in response. 
This is far too big a situation for me 
to—” 

“You son of a bitch! If you at- 
tack, the whole planet’s done for!” 
Merrivale froze in shock, the 
phone pressed against his ear, de- 
tected a glint of shared response in 
Gammel’s eyes. That was not how 
one addressed a superior! 

I N THE Hive aerie, Hellstrom 
leaned close to Janvert, whis- 
pered, “Tell him the Hive wishes to 
negotiate. Temporize. Ask him why 
he hasn’t investigated with the 
Pentagon about the new island. Tell 
him we are quite ready to vaporize 
an area of several hundred square 
miles around Washington, D.C., if 
he needs further demonstrations.” 
Janvert relayed this message. 
“Have you seen this weapon?” 
Merrivale asked. 

‘Yes.” 

“Describe it.” 

“Are you nuts? They won’t let me 
describe it. But I’ve seen it and I’ve 
seen the little hand version of it.” 
The first aide Gammel had sent 
from the room returned, whispered 
hoarsely in the SAIC’s ear. Gam- 
mel scribbled on the notepad: 
Pentagon confirms. They’re 
sending assault team. 

Merrivale said, “Shorty, do you 
really believe they can do this?” 
“I’ve been telling you nothing 
else, damn it! Haven’t you checked 
with the Pentagon yet?” 

“Shorty, I hate to say this, but it 
seems to me that several fission 
bombs, one right on top of the other 
into — ” 

‘You damned idiot! Will you 



84 



GALAXY 




stop making stupid suggestions?” 
Merrivale glared at the base of 
the telephone. “Shorty, I must ask 
that you moderate your tone and 
your passions. This sounds like the 
very kind of subversion we must — ” 
“I’m calling the President,” 
Janvert said. ‘"You know I can do 
it. You gave me the Signal Corps 
number and code yourself. He’ll 
answer, too. You and the Agency 
can go plumb straight to — ” 
“Shorty!” Merrivale was out- 
raged and abruptly fearful. This 
thing was getting completely out of 
hand. Janvert’s fanciful warnings 
might have some substance in 
them — the military would find out 
about that quickly enough — but a 
call to the President would have 
widespread repercussions. Heads 
would roll. 

“Calm yourself. Shorty,” Mer- 
rivale said. “Now listen to me. 
What assurance do I have that 
you’re telling me the truth? You 
describe a pretty desperate situa- 
tion — one I find extremely difficult 
to believe. If it is anything even re- 
motely resembling what you 
describe, however, it clearly calls 
for a military solution and I’ve no 
alternative but to — ” 

Janvert asked, “Haven’t you 
understood a single thing I’ve said? 
There won’t be any world for your 
damned military solution to take 
place on if you make one wrong 
move now! There won’t be 
anything! These people can blow 
the planet apart — or pulverize any 
piece of it they choose. You 
couldn’t break through to them in 
time to prevent that. The planet’s at 
stake — the whole planet, do you 
understand me?” 



Gammel reached out, grabbed 
Merrivale’s telephone arm and 
shook it to demand attention. Mer- 
rivale looked at him. 

Gammel held up a sheet of paper 
on which he had written: Go along 
with him. Ask personal inspection 
visit. Until we’re sure, we cannot 
take chances. 

Merrivale pursed his lips in 
thought. Go along with him? That 
was madness. Blow up the world, 
indeed! He said, “Shorty, I’m sure 
my own profound doubts about 
this—” 



ABRUPTLY Gammel dropped 
J\. his earphones, grabbed the 
telephone out of Merrivale’s hand, 
thrust Merrivale aside and mo- 
tioned for two of his aides to hold 
Merrivale. 

“Janvert,” Gammel said, “this is 
Waverly Gammel. I spoke to you a 
few minutes ago when you first 
called. I’m a senior agent with the 
FBI. I’ve been listening to your 
conversation and I, for one, am 
ready to go along with — ” 

“They’re just stalling!” Mer- 
rivale shouted, struggling with the 
agents who held him. “They’re 
bluffing, you fool! They can’t — ” 

Gammel put a hand over the 
receiver, addressed his men: “Take 
him outside and shut the door.” He 
returned to his conversation with 
Janvert, explained, “That was Mer- 
rivale. I’ve had him forcibly 
removed. Under the circumstances 
I suspect he must be insane. I am 
going to come out to that — that 
hive myself and I am going to look 
at whatever it is you can show me to 
substantiate this weird story. I will 



PROJECT 40

ask that any action from this end be 
delayed until I report back, but 1 
will put a time limit on that. Do you 
understand all of that, Janvert?” 

“You sound like somebody with 
a few smarts, Gammel,” Janvert 
said. “I thank God for that. Just a 
minute.” 

Hellstrom bent close to Janvert, 
spoke in a low voice. 

Janvert said, “Hellstrom says 
you can come out here under those 
terms and will be permitted to 
report bade in person. It’s my 
opinion that you can trust him.” 

“That’s good enough for me,” 
Gammel said. “Tell me exactly 
where I report at that farm.” 

“Just come to the barn,” Janvert 
said. “That’s where it all begins.” 

As Janvert replaced the telephone 
in its cradle, Hellstrom turned 
away, wondering why he no longer 
felt tired. The Hive was going to get 
its big block of time. That seemed 
obvious. There were a few among 
the wild Outsiders who could be 
reasoned with — people such as this . 
Janvert and the agent on the 
telephone, that Gammel person. 
Such people would understand the 
implications of the Hive’s new 
stinger. They would recognize the 
need for change. Things were going 
to change in this world, too. 
Hellstrom knew what his own 
course had to be. He would bargain 
with the Outsider government for 
conditions under which the Hive 
could continue its mimic existence 
unobserved by the wild masses. The 
secrecy could not last indefinitely, 
of course. The Hive itself would see 
to that. They were going to swarm 
before long and there was nothing 
the Outsiders could do to prevent 



that swarming. Swarm would 
follow swarm thereafter and the 
wild ones would be assimilated and 
pushed back into smaller and 
smaller portions of the planet 
they shared now with tomorrow’s 
humans. 

From Joseph M err i vale’s 
report to the Agency Board: As 
you know we are effectively 
blocked from any further active 
participation in this matter, a 
decision whose shortsight- 
edness we all recognize. We 
are consulted on the problem 
from time to time, however, 
and I can give you some idea of 
how things are proceeding in 
Washington. 

My own private guess at the 
moment is that this Hellstrom 
will be permitted to continue 
with his filthy cult at least for 
the time being — and he may 
even be allowed to continue 
making his subversive films. 

The see-saw of the official 
debate is polarized at this 
moment around the following 
two opposing viewpoints: 

1) Blast them out and damn 
the consequences. This is a 
minority viewpoint which I 
share, but which is losing 
adherents. 

2) Stall for time by making 

a secret agreement with 
Hellstrom, thereby keeping 
knowledge of the Hive from the 
public, while at the same time 
we mount a massive research 
program aimed at destruction 
of what is coming to be called 
in most official circles “The 
Hellstrom Horror.” ★

O F LATE there have been pods 
of monographs written by lin- 
guists cum psychiatrists inferring 
that Celia Hammersmith drowned 
herself off Point Fermin because 
she could find no more worlds to 
conquer and/or could never find 
love. Such speculations are un- 
treated ambergris. After pioneering 
the greatest breakthrough in the 
history of linguistics Celia Ham- 
mersmith died inadvertently from 
raptures of the deep. I know be- 
cause I was there, sharing her 
rapture. 

"It is of public record that the 
Celia Hammersmith College of 
Delphinology was opened by 
government grant to exploit the 
talents of the world’s foremost lin- 
guist. Of course there were political 
overtones to the establishment of 
Celia’s Hermosa Beach facility — 
politicians were wooing the 
woman’s vote — but the grant 
reflects accurately the preeminence 
she had at thirty-one achieved in 
her profession. C.H.C.D. was 
founded to train delphinologists 
and to research methods of commu- 
nicating with dolphins. I count it no 
small honor that I was the first dol- 
phin in Celia’s tank. 

Our meeting was inevitable. 
Hermosa Beach is only a few miles 
north of the Marineland of the Pa- 
cific where I was the star of the 
Great Aquatic Burlycue. All dol- 
phins are burlesque artists, Celia 
once told me. I was the hammiest 
of the hams — my act always 



brought down the net. Rising out of 
the water with a plastic top hat 
abaft my beak, I would grasp a 
cane under my right flipper and, 
balancing almost vertically on my 
flukes, thrash half across the tank 
while the band played The Man 
Who Broke the Bank at Monte 
Carlo. 

We dolphins have an affinity for 
human beings. To my natural incli- 
nation add the convivality of a hot- 
blooded Mediterranean dolphin, all 
male and eight feet long. Tank born 
and aquarium bred, to me Homo 
semi-sapiens was as familiar as my 
mother’s milk. Still, until I met 
Celia you all looked alike to me, of 
one sex, upright and bifurcated. 
Your swiveled heads and stuck-out 
ears are your least attractive fea- 
tures. Still, I’m tolerant. Nothing is 
wrong with your head that a 
hearing-aid would not fix, as Celia 
recognized. 

She did not have the ears for our 
frequencies, but she devised an 
acoustic converter attached to an 
underwater listening device and put 
an old dolphin into the tank with 
me. Since he was almost too feeble 
to bounce an echo off a net, I gave 
him a few turning directions, at 
first. An overhead camera revealed 
his responses to my instructions 
and Celia, alone in her office, was 
deciphering the sounds. 

At night the old bull talked of his 
youth in the open ocean, of the 
cows he had led to calving, the 
straight-line swimming, the fights

with sharks. He was a Nebraska 
farmer telling a Tasmanian about 
the delights of com husking. All I 
got from his stories was an attack 
of agoraphobia. The thought of all 
that water outside my tank scared 
the hell out of me. 

So there 1 cowered, at the age of 
seven, nostalgic over my aborted 
career in burlesque while the oldster 
wheezed and clicked. In her office 
Celia Hammersmith was listening 
to the old bull’s tales with far more 
interest than I. 

One night the center net of the 
tank was lowered, trapping me in 
the landward end of the tank and 
the oldster on the seaward side. 
Then the sea gates were opened, 
and the oldster swam out into the 
lagoon wheezing “So long, cousin.” 
For a while I listened to his 
soundings and got him beyond the 
breakwater. The gates closed — the 
net lifted and I was alone in the 
tank. 

B Y INSTINCT and choice, dol- 
phins are gregarious — nothing 
is lonelier than a lonely dolphin. 
Three days and three nights I spent 
without seeing a living being. Meals 
were fed to me from a dump bucket 
on an overhead trolley. 

Celia had put me in solitary. 

On a night of a full moon with no 
sound in the tank but that of my 
own breathing, I heard a splash 
followed by the flop-flop of a 
human swimmer approaching me. 
Then a hand was stroking my flip- 



per, another tweaking my dorsal, as 
my tympans were quivered by a 
gentlymocking vibration. 

“Well met by moonlight, lonely 
cetacean.” 

What would you think, cousin, if 
your house cat looked up to tell you 
it was feeling ill? For a certainty 
you would look for the ventriloquist 
before you went for the catnip. At 
least you would have that al- 
ternative to my complete 
stupefaction. 

“My name is Celia,” the voice 
continued. “You’re called Happy. I 
want to be your friend.” 

Since “friend” is a dangerously 
amorphic word in Delphine, I was 
shocked into deeper silence and had 
to assume it was a “she” who 
spoke. 

“Happy is a good name. It’s the 
sound of leaping and splashing and 
tossing a ball through a hoop. It fits 
you. You were especially chosen by 
me after I saw you in the burlesque 
show. Such verve. Such marvelous 
spontaneity. Such intelligence.” 

Be aware mine is a liberal 
translation. Delphine is communi- 
cated in larger units and faster than 
human speech. It has to be. 
Without that survival device, the 
only dolphin extant would be 
Grampus orca the killer whale. 

“Happy, we’ll never get to know 
each other unless you speak. I’m 
talking to you through a flutter 
diaphragm held to the roof of my 
mouth. My ear plugs are acoustic 
converters. I’ll understand you, so 



THE GIRL AND THE DOLPHIN 



89 




speak to me, Happy. Quit being so 
damned coy!” 

My silence was not coyness. The 
dolphin’s code is a complex cabala 
and my instincts held it sacred. 
Without it we might lose dominion 
over the sea— and despite my lack 
of bigotry I was a little wary of 
man. What sea-dweller would not 
be after Eniwetok and Bikini? 

Celia’s voice had lost its pique 
when she spoke again. “Our species 
have much in common. Happy. 
You are lords of the sea and we are 
lords of the land. We’re both warm- 
blooded, intelligent mammals. My 
hand is a rudimentary flipper.” 

Oh, Celia was smooth — ponder 
her last remark — but I kept silent. 1 
repeat: I like human beings, but 
they are not dolphins. 

“I won’t hurt you, Happy. I’m a 
cow and you’re a bull.” 

Another remark worth pon- 
dering. So humans were not of one 
sex! 

“Don’t you like me a little, 
Happy?” She tweaked my dorsal 
again. “Say something for me — 
and I’ll give you an extra herring 
for breakfast.” 

I would not say anything but I 
gave her an affectionate nudge with 
my flipper. After all, she said she 
was a cow. 

“Well, that’s worth a sardine,” 
she laughed. “But you think it over. 
I’ll keep you in solitary tomorrow 
to give you plenty of time to think, 
and I’ll be back tomorrow night. I 
simply must discover if your verbal 
wit equals the comic mimicry that 



always brought down the net at the 
Great Aquatic Burlycue. So long, 
cousin.” 

The loneliest sound I have ever 
heard was the flip-flop of her with- 
drawing strokes, but a linguistic 
note is in order here. Some African 
dialects employ a click-speech 
similar to the click of a dolphin and 
some Canary Islanders communi- 
cate by whistling. Celia’s back- 
ground in such languages helped 
her to synthesize an almost flawless 
Delphine. 

DELIBERATED until next 
evening, since all 1 could do was 
deliberate. The old bull was the 
code breaker, not me, but my 
reluctance to engage in inter- 
species communication was false 
pride. As Celia had pointed out, 
dolphins and men were co-equal 
lords of sea and land. Fraterniza- 
tion, viewed in this light, became 
nothing more than noblesse oblige. 
Besides, after being in solitary all 
day, by nightfall I was willing to 
whistle back to a whistle-buoy. 

When I heard her splash into the 
tank, I silently sank to the bottom, 
listening to her splashing above me 
and calling, “Happy, where are 
you?” 

I was rising to nudge her with my 
beak and to surface beside her, 
rolling over to reveal my underside. 
As a delphinologist Celia surely 
recognized the signal: “flashing the 
white.” 

She scratched my belly and slap- 



90 



GALAXY 




ped it, asking, “How does that feel, 
Happy?” 

“Like wallowing in a school of 
tuna.” 

My reply was not Lafayette, we 
are here or One short step for a 
man, but it was the first concept de- 
livered to a human being by a dol- 
phin through the fibrillation of a 
blowhole. 

“Now it’s down to business, you 
teaser,” she said, shaking my flip- 
per. “First you must learn human 
metaphors. You should have said, 
‘It’s more fun than a barrel of mon- 
keys.’ ” 

So my beginning association with 
Celia Hammersmith was purely on 
a teacher-student basis. With a con- 
fidence approaching arrogance she 
had readied an English-to-Delphine 
translating machine and began im- 
mediately to pipe lectures into my 
tank. My first week was spent on 
vocabulary exercises and the rudi- 
ments of English grammar, my 
second on a survey of human his- 
tory. From the knowledge gained in 
such fashion, cousins, I gathered 
that you’ve come a long way from 
the day you crawled out of the 
ocean to crack crabs and develop 
your rudimentary flippers. I am not 
sure in which direction you’ve 
come. 

Since sleep is a luxury few sea 
creatures can afford, I listened 
night and day to the lectures. The 
only break in my lessons came 
when Celia paddled out in the 
evenings to review my day’s intake 



in a question-and-answer period. 
When I asked the wrong questions I 
got a “no comment” and was de- 
prived of my belly slap. Celia was 
teaching me manners as well as 
metaphors. 

In my fourth week I taped, via a 
translating machine, the first 
monograph authored by a dolphin, 
Delphinic Idioms and Speech Pat- 
terns. Despite its historical value 
the Institute’s publications de- 
partment refused to publish it be- 
cause it lacked footnotes, this 
despite a paragraph in the 
dissertation explaining the absence 
of the concept “foot” in Delphine. 

N evertheless, Celia ap- 
pointed me instructor in Del- 
phine and assigned me two tank- 
side classes a day. My lectures were 
spoken into a translating machine 
and broadcast to my students in 
English. The students took notes 
but never laughed at my witticisms. 
My humor must have been lost in 
translation. At this stage I would 
have preferred to strut across the 
tank with my top hat and cane 
while the band played The Man 
Who Broke the Bank at Monte 
Carlo. 

In the evenings Celia came to lie 
beside me on an air mattress and 
review my lessons. She began to 
stay longer, often until midnight, 
and to talk more about herself and 
her childhood. Gradually I came to 
detect nuances in her whistles and 
clicks which bespoke her sadness 



THE GIRL AND THE DOLPHIN 



91 




over a life which had found its only 
expression in a driving urge to 
work. In a way I was her psychia- 
trist, but I was also relieved by her 
presence. The squeaks, squeals, 
whistles and clicks of the lectures 
were silenced when she came — and 
frankly I was becoming more 
interested in Celia and what she 
thought of me than I was in the 
Punic Wars. 

Concerned by my students’ indif- 
ference to my verbal wit, I asked 
her one night to give me her evalua- 
tion of me as a conversationalist. 

“Your speech is rhetorical, even 
flamboyant by human standards, 
though for all I know you may be a 
laconic dolphin. Really, there’s no 
way for me to compare your 
standing with other dolphins 
unless. .” 

She paused, silent and pensive. 

“Unless what, Celia?” 

Suddenly she rolled on her side to 
face me, speaking with a pell-mell 
breathlessness as if she had been 
suddenly seized by an exciting 
notion. “Unless I opened the gates 
some night — to let you go out and 
lure some fellow dolphin back into 
the tank with you. You could do it, 
Happy. With your Ramboyant 
rhetoric and fantastic charm, you 
could talk the horn off a narwhal. 
Would you like to try?” 

I considered her request, which 
had as many ramifications as a 
giant squid. I would have preferred 
an electric eel in my tank to a fellow 
dolphin to share Celia’s attention — 



and to get one, as Celia well knew, 1 
would have to bring back the whole 
school and turn my tank into a sar- 
dine can. Besides, if she needed 
another dolphin she could requi- 
sition one at the government’s 
expense. So why had she made such 
a proposal? 

Suddenly I intuited the answer — 
Celia was testing my loyalty to her. 
But an unproved intuition is an idle 
fancy. I had to be sure this one was 
right or become the world’s first 
red-faced, jackass dolphin. 

I heaved a long, sad sigh from my 
blowhole and fibrillated wistfully, 
“It might be fun to cruise out and 
cut some lovely young cow from the 
herd to share my tank and learn my 
tricks.” 

“Oh, no! I’m permitting no 
menage a trois in this tank.” 

Celia did not know it, but she had 
been tossed on my fluke. My in- 
tuition was precisely correct. 

“Well, there goes my contri- 
bution to science,” I said. 

“Science, hah! From that 
smarmy sigh I’d say that hanky- 
panky’s more like it.” 

There had been a shift in our rela- 
tionship and the time for honesty 
had come. I nudged her raft 
contritely. “Celia, I was just 
splashing a little spray in your eyes. 
You’re the only companion I want. 
My wit and my rhetoric are only for 
you.” 

So saying, I emitted a longer, 
smarmier sigh. 

“Oh, bosh! Fiddlesticks!” she 



92 



GALAXY 




said, but she tweaked my dorsal. 

Perhaps it was on that night that 
a channel marker floated past and 
an unseen helmsman changed our 
course. Certain I am that I have 
never felt closer to any mammal, 
cetacean or Homo sapiens, and our 
rapport stirred a curiosity in my 
mind. In a manner I intended to be 
casual but actually was tense, I 
asked, “Celia, would you pipe me a 
course in human anatomy?” 

I F SHE noticed my tension she 
did not let on and piped in the 
course. Soon I was studying the 
students at the tank side who were 
studying me. Females, I noticed, 
carried an extra set of buttocks on 
their chests. Celia told me they 
were mammary protuberances 
which all female mammals had in 
common, she as well as my own 
mother. Looking at Celia’s, I had 
to take her word for it, but for the 
life of me I couldn’t remember 
mama’s. 

She augmented my course in 
human anatomy with evening re- 
marks on comparative anatomy. 

Human mating is a contact sport. 
Dolphin mating is a collision sport 
in which a sonic lure replaces court- 
ship. Buffering the tale with long, 
Latin words, Celia told me of an at- 
tendant in a Florida aquarium who 
sounded in jest a recording of the 
mating call of a female Delphinis 
delphis while submerged. The wag’s 
last memory was of sixteen tor- 
pedo-shaped objects hurtling 



toward him at thirty knots. In 
seconds he was sodomized to 
shreds. 

Anatomy became the next to last 
science that I studied. Celia was 
changing my curriculum to empha- 
size the arts. In order to enrich my 
metaphorical language, I was given 
four hours of poetry every morning, 
fifteen minutes of Shakespeare and 
three hours and forty-five minutes 
of Romantic Poetry. 

Shakespeare’s good but he's a lit- 
tle too rich for my blood. From the 
outset I felt an affinity for Lord 
Byron — which grew stronger as the 
strangely disturbing concepts of ro- 
mance swam within my ken. I 
learned of women wailing for their 
demon lovers and wondered about 
human female preferences. I pon- 
dered such lines as How do / love 
thee? My favorite poem was 
Byron’s To Augusta, and Celia’s 
was Leda and the Swan. She also 
read me certain passages from Jef- 
fers’ Roan Stallion. One poem, at 
the time our mutual favorite, which 
I never wish to hear again, is The 
Forsaken Merman. 

Our discussions about the con- 
cepts of the poems bred an intimacy 
between Celia and me. Although, 
by using Latinate circumlocutions, 
Celia explained the mechanics of 
romance, she was never able to 
define love. 

“One must feel it, Happy. Love 
can’t be defined without first being 
felt. Shelley called it ‘desire of the 
moth for the star, a devotion to 



THE GIRL AND THE DOLPHIN 



93 




something afar from the sphere of 
our sorrow.’ ” 

A sadness in her voice pained me. 
To divert her I asked, “What’s a 
moth?” 

“A fluttering, light-seeking 
insect. Oh, Happy, I must pipe 
you a course in entomology.” 

I had stuck my flipper in my 
blowhole. I needed a course in ento- 
mology like I needed a course in 
home economics, but I had diverted 
Celia. Rather abruptly 1 returned 
to the original subject. 

“Now that we’ve heard about 
love from Shelley, what’s the word 
from Hammersmith?” 

“I confess, Happy, love is one of 
the few areas in which I’m not an 
expert. You see, I’ve never been in 
love. I’m quite tall for a woman. 
Because of my intelligence and my 
height, boys always looked on me 
as an object. On the other hand, I 
feel uncomfortable with a male 
under six feet long with an I.Q. of 
less than a hundred and sixty. Still, 
* I haven’t answered your question, 
have I?” 

A pensive huskiness replaced the 
sadness in her voice. 

“I think love is a rapport between 
a male and a female mammal who 
regard each other with tenderness, 
who sense each other’s moods, who 
delight in each other’s wit and rhet- 
oric. But I’m so busy, Happy. Any 
male I could even consider would 
have to be one involved with me in 
my work.” 

She sighed and continued, “Now 



I suppose I am loved by my 
students, not as an object but as an 
institution, the Celia Hammersmith 
College of Delphinology.” 

“You are uniquely beloved, 
Celia,” I assured her. “Most 
students revere their institution 
only as an abstraction — only the 
students of Hammersmith have 
their alma mater embodied in so 
lovely a package of such infinite va- 
riety.” 

My remark was pure sper- 
mecetti. I was hard put to tell the 
difference between the sexes, much 
less recognize intersex comeliness. 
But my words served their pur- 
pose — which was to cheer her up — 
for suddenly she turned to me. 

“Happy, don’t you ever yearn for 
the free sweep of the open ocean, 
the wind’s song, the whitecaps 
dancing in glee?” 

From the spontaneity of her 
remark, I knew she was voicing a 
well-thought plan, and her wishes 
were not mine. The idea of all that 
ocean out there still scared the hell 
out of me. 

Noncomittally I answered, “The 
old bull spoke of it with longing, 
but I’m afraid of depths. In 
anything over nine fathoms. I’d be 
lost.” Then I added the clincher, I 
thought. “Once I got out there I’d 
never find my way back to you.” 
“I’d be with you, Happy. I’d 
guide you home.” 

Then she told me the legend of 
the boy on the dolphin and whimsi- 
cally suggested that we rewrite the 



94 



GALAXY 




legend as The Girl on the Dolphin. 
So contagious was her enthusiasm 
that within five minutes 1 was 
taking Celia, mounted abaft my 
dorsal, for a spin around the tank. 
Maneuvering was easy enough al- 
though the wool of her bathing suit 
chafed me slightly. 

We planned a shakedown cruise 
on the morrow evening to test the 
strength of my phobia and my 
fatigue factor. Celia promised to 
eliminate the skin irritant by re- 
moving the bathing suit if I kept her 
nudity secret. I told her my name 
was Happy, not Gabby. 

I T WAS no surprise to me, the 
next night, when she arrived at 
the tank with a harness designed to 
my contours which must have taken 
a week to fabricate. In the 
darkness she harnessed me, 
slithered out of her bathing suit, 
opened the sea gates and mounted 
me. 1 moved out at a modest three 
knots to minimize my wake and to 
prevent night strollers on the jetty 
from spotting my naked rider. 

So by stealth and by night we 
slipped the confines of the shore to 
range the shimmering spaceways of 
the sea. My agoraphobia vanished 
beneath the bright beauty of the girl 
with golden, spray-wet hair, who 
met my undulations with her own, 
and so light a burden was never 
borne by dolphin. Celia was a 
natural-born, bare-tailed bareback 
rider. 



Off Portuguese Bend, she found 
she could stay astride me by leg 
pressure alone and tossed the 
harness away. The last artifact of 
man was gone from between us. 
Night and silence claimed us as we 
climbed and descended the heaves 
of the off-shore swells, and the 
wine-dark ocean was less a mystery 
to me than the joys of our passage. 
Finally she guided me home, 
steering me with nudges of her 
kneecaps. In truth I could have 
found my way back to Hermosa 
Beach, via the great circle route, 
from Taiwan, but I didn’t tell Celia. 
I enjoyed the kneecap nudges. 

We got home around one o’clock. 

Thereafter our nights were filled 
with revelry which began when 
Celia whopped my belly with her 
heels and cried, “Away, Happy! 
Westward ho.” 

Oh, they were joys, our nightly 
gambols. With my sonar we 
avoided driftwood. With Celia’s 
eyesight we swam wide of the run- 
ning lights of vessels. In the 
darkness our passing was marked 
only by our phosphorescent wake, 
which I now think of as a symbol of 
our love, so bright yet fading so 
swiftly into eternal darkness. 

My favorite of the games we 
played was “crack the whip.” I 
would try to unseat Celia by quick, 
high-speed turns, thus forcing her 
to grip me tighter with both legs, 
both arms, and all four buttocks. 
Her favorite game was “bucking 
bronco,” in which I tried to toss her 



THE GIRL AND THE DOLPHIN 



95 




from my back with extreme and 
rapid undulations. In this game she 
could only retain her seat by thigh 
pressure and by arching her body to 
maintain her balance. With her 
shrieking, “Ride ’im, cowgirl!” and 
me churning up a few square miles 
of water, there must have been 
some surprised albacore in our 
rodeo grandstands. 

Often when I felt her thighs relax 
I would glide from beneath her and 
listen, from three or four fathoms, 
to her thrashing about on the sur- 
face and calling my name. When 
her breathing grew labored I would 
rise beneath her. It was a way of 
keeping the knee pressure up. 

At times I lolled in the ocean, 
Celia stretched alongside, her head 
resting on my flipper, and We dis- 
cussed the meaning of life, marine 
and terrestrial. One night, with San 
Clemente Island bearing 036° true 
and twenty miles distant, I asked, 
“Celia, what do you think my I. Q. 
is?” 

“It’s incalcuable. An I. Q. 
measures a human average and 
there’s only one Happy known to 
man.” 

“Do you think it’s over a hundred 
and sixty?” 

“Perhaps. You’re the most 
brilliant dolphin I ever talked to.” 

“Thanks.” 

“Why do you ask a stupid 
question like that?” 

“I’m over six feet long. The 
thought came to me that if my I.Q. 
were over a hundred and sixty I 



might qualify as your ideal male 
mammal.” 

She giggled, the one human 
sound any dolphin recognizes, and 
said, “For all the good it does you, 
you are my favorite male mam- 
mal.” 

I KNEW what she meant from 
the supplementary lectures in 
comparative anatomy and simply 
to let her know that I understood 
the meaning of her mirth, I said, 
“Ah, yes. The sonic romantic bar- 
rier.” 

She had been lying with her head 
on my flipper, completely relaxed. 
Suddenly I felt her neck muscles 
tighten. 

“Happy, I’ve forgotten some- 
thing. We must hurry home — 
now.” 

As she spoke, she was swinging 
astride me and the rapport we had 
established told me she was a very 
frightened girl. Calling to her to 
hang tight, I beat shoreward at 
twenty-two knots, and she did not 
relax until we entered the harbor. 
By then I had hypothesized an ex- 
planation for her terror, verifed by 
her remark as she closed the sea 
gates. “Happy, we’ll have to stop 
these nightly rambles. Lack of sleep 
is killing me.” 

As far as it went she spoke the 
truth — we were in early and it was 
2:30 a.m. But my remark had 
alerted her to a danger neither of us 
had considered. If we had been 
thirty miles out to sea and a female 



96 



GALAXY 




dolphin anywhere within a ten-mile 
radius had sounded her love call, 
Celia’s great and loyal friend, 
Happy, would have been off like the 
Flying Dutchman, leaving Celia to 
the loneliness of the long-distance 
swimmer. 

Among male dolphins, the Song 
of the Siren is not a legend but a 
fact. I could not, in all honesty, 
dissuade Celia from her unvoiced 
fear. Except as a racial memory I 
had never heard the siren’s song, 
but 1 was getting eager to hear the 
music. 

So it was back to the air mattress 
in the tank and our evening talks, 
now grown lackadaisical despite the 
affection between us. Lolling in the 
confines of a tank grown op- 
pressive, we shared our unvoiced 
dream of high romance beyond the 
seawall. Celia grew irritable and 
petulant. 1 lost my appetite, even 
for Quinalt salmon. Our inner ten- 
sions grew. We were wasting away 
together. 

Finally Celia could stand it no 
longer. On the tenth night of our 
captivity, she made an an- 
nouncement. 

“Happy, I’m going to Marine- 
land, tomorrow.” 

“Not to get me a fellow tank 
mate, I hope.” 

“Would you be terribly upset if I 
did?” 

“I’d ask for a transfer back to 
burlesque. You could change my 
name to Unhappy. I’d sulk. How 
could I talk to you with some 



beakish female listening to every 
sound?” 

“Of course I’d never share you, 
Happy. No, I’m going to listen to 
some tape recordings and I’m 
giving you a day off from lectures 
and lecturing. I want you well 
rested. And if it will ease your mind 
I’ll pipe in something diverting. 
Would you like Brahms, 
Beethoven, Bach?” 

“No. I’ll take the complete works 
of Byron. Why do you want me 
rested?” 

“We’re going to sea again tomor- 
row night.” 

With that I flipped her air mat- 
tress and went leaping around the 
tank in confined joy. When she 
clambered back atop the mattress I 
was calm enough to listen further. 

“I wish to go to a kelp bed in a 
Catalina cove. I’m writing a paper 
on the nocturnal habits of kelp 
fish.” 

“Kelp fish! When did you strike 
up this romance?” 

“A girl likes to have a few 
secrets, Happy. After we’re there 
you can patrol the inlet to keep out 
sharks.” 

This was one hell of a way for me 
to spend an evening out, patrolling 
the bar while she fondled kelp fish. 
I fell silent. 

“What are you thinking about, 
Happy?” 

“The life of a sea lord — one night 
a bucking bronco, the next a watch 
dog.” 

“Oh, it won’t be all work.” 



THE GIRL AND THE DOLPHIN 



97 




The next night she came, bringing 
an aqua-lung. Without a word of 
greeting she opened the sea gates, 
took off her bathing suit, put on the 
aqua-lung and mounted me. She 
did not give me the customary belly 
whop with her heels. Instead she 
issued me sailing orders in a pecu- 
liarly strained voice, “Head south- 
southwest to the western tip of 
Catalina and follow the northeast 
coast line. Don’t dally — and don’t 
undulate excessively.” 

Nothing more was said as we put 
to sea. Her rigid thighs gnd silence 
told me she was distraught, 
consumed by some inner urgency. 
Keeping to course, I propelled us 
by a rapid flutter of the flukes, 
holding my body to a minimal 
pitch. 

Y ELEVEN-THIRTY I am 
hove to a hundred yards off- 
shore from the kelp beds, keeping a 
sonic lookout for sharks and hoping 
one will appear. I am in the mood 
for splitting a shark’s aorta, 
bursting a liver and sending one of 
those saw-mouthed bastards spi- 
raling down into that bourne from 
which no shark returns. 

My mood is at odds with the 
scene. Inshore I hear Celia working 
among the kelp beds. A full moon is 
rising above Point Fermin. A 
breeze stands fair from Asia. To 
westward along the reaches of the 
headland I hear the long with- 
drawing roar of the surf. 
Then it came, the beginning solo 



of a Delphinis angel, the tremulous, 
quavering, beckoning, flute-like 
opening. 

I wheeled. The sound was coming 
from inshore, flooding the waters of 
the cove. The music changed to the 
tympanic ripple of drums and my 
body quivered, waiting. The First 
notes of an organ rose above the 
drums. 

The organ notes did it. Before the 
bar had gone half a measure I was 
barreling toward the beach at forty 
knots, seeking the source of the 
siren’s song. 

In eight feet of water and an 
aqua-lung I found waiting for me 
on the sandy bottom all the sirens 
of legend: Parthenope, Leucosia, 
Ligea. Waiting for me was the apo- 
theosis of feminine mammalian 
beauty, Earth mother of the sea- 
born, queen among women and 
mistress of aural mimicry — Celia 
Hammersmith. Celia had listened 
well to the recordings at Marine- 
land and learned every note of the 
language of the dolphin’s heart. 

Separated by millennia, the tides 
of our mammalian blood swirled 
together again in an eddy, a vortex, 
a maelstrom. My cousin, my bride, 
returned to the sea, or at least to its 
littoral strand — a problem of 

purchase was solved in the 
shallows — and returned to her 
forsaken merman. 

Together we erased eons and that 
night Celia Hammersmith found 
love. By her own admission, later, 
as we lolled on the sand, I was the 




98 



GALAXY 




most esoteric bit of erotica in the 
history of feminine diversions. 

Had we left well enough alone, 
this treatise need never have been 
recorded to silence the slithering 
sprats of conjecturists who insin- 
uate Celia’s drowning was suicide 
But eons were not enough for one 
night. Who can turn his gaze away 
after glimpsing paradise? 

Coursing homeward, I was dol- 
phin transfigured bearing woman 
transformed. No longer inhibited 
by propriety, we talked of the 
wonder we had shared. Celia 
confessed that 1 had long been her 
ideal male, eight feet long with an 
incalculable I.Q. 

“But 1 love you as much, Happy, 
for your flamboyant rhetoric, your 
irrepressible good humor and your 
wit.” 

“I’ll buy the first two,” I said, 
“but no one laughs at my jokes ex- 
cept you.” 

“The others haven’t grasped the 
subtleties of cetacean humor. But 
give them time. Someday you’ll be 



the world’s most famous lie-down 
comic.” 

In turn I confessed how I had 
long adored her whimsy, her golden 
hair, her downside-up buttocks and 
the pressure of her kneecaps abaft 
my dorsal. “But your singing really 
gets me, Celia.” 

Somewhere over the Santa Bar- 
bara Deeps, Celia grew concerned 
over a lack of reciprocity in our 
love. I had joined with her on the 
littoral strand which made me a 
shallow-water merman. To make 
us co-equals in love, she should join 
with me in this fathomless water 
and become a true mermaid. I 
didn’t question her logic, but I did 
point out the problem of purchase 
we had solved in the shallows. 
Here, the bottom lay furlongs 
below. 

Celia’s clicks and whistles 
conveyed an enigmatic whimsy as 
she told me she could solve the 
problem. She asked, “Are you 
game for a gambol in the deeps, 
Happy?”

Women and dolphins are not 
men. I was willing. 

“Sing it, again, Celia. But skip 
the flutes and drums. Just the organ 
notes.” 

Above me 1 could hear the tempo 
of Celia’s breathing speed up as she 
put on the mask of the aqua-lung. 
She checked the oxygen in the 
cylinder. She was a romantic yet a 
woman, too, at all times practical. 

Sounding the organ notes, she 
slipped beneath me and grasped my 
flippers; my horizontal stabilizers 
were to be her means of gaining 
purchase. So slight was the down- 
ward tilt the weight of the aqua- 
lung gave my body that I failed to 
notice my increasing angle of 
descent as my flukes, with powerful 
strokes, thrust toward a more 
perfect union. Seeking rapture in 
the deeps, we both forgot the rap- 
ture of the dark deep — nitrogen 
narcosis. 

At forty or fifty fathoms Celia 
muttered dreamily, “Happy, 
darling, I could float like this 
forever. But the aqua-lung’s got to 
go. It hampers me.” 

So saying, she took off her aqua- 
lung and threw it aside. O, double- 
edged rapture! Too late 1 realized it 
was not Celia but the nitrogen 
talking. 

Immediately I levered her up- 
ward. We broke surface at an esti- 
mated sixty knots. At the apex of a 
twenty-foot arc we two parted in 
silence and spray. Celia hit the 
water first, spread-eagled on the 



surface. I landed a few feet beyond 
her. 

V AINLY calling her name, I 
swam a circle around her 
thrice. In the moonlight her golden 
hair resembled the petals of a 
white-stalked sea anemone, rising 
and falling, ominously horizontal. 
Then I knew that we would go no 
more a-roving so late into the night. 

In a final act of homage, I 
nudged her body shoreward down 
the shimmering moonpath on the 
sea, carrying her back to the land 
which had given her birth. So Celia 
took one last ride with me, but the 
irrepressible good humor she loved 
was gone forever. Henceforward I 
would be Happy in name only. 
Thus did I mourn. 

But that which shapes us binds all 
nature with similitudes. Out of the 
whale comes ambergris and out of 
the ambergris the perfume. Out of 
my great grief came a melody and 
out of the melody a good humor 
more irrepressible than ever. 

As 1 pushed her body landward, 1 
began to chant, lowly and slowly at 
first, as a Requiem for Celia, the 
man-song I knew best. Im- 
perciptibly my body began to undu- 
late to the rhythm of the Requiem. 
I stepped up the tempo, nudging on 
the up notes, clicking and whistling 
more loudly: For - I’m - the - guy - 
that - married - the - girl - who - 
broke - up - the - home - of - the - 
man - who - broke - the - bank - at - 
Monte - Carlo. ★

"My literary biography is short." says 
John Boyd. And spectacular, add your edi- 
tors. His first work— a mainstream novel 
published in 1968 — was grabbed by the 
movies, a book club, four foreign publishers; 
now a paperback, to date it has sold more 
than 300.000 copies. His second novel, also 
published in 1968, was science fiction: THE 
LAST STARSHIP FROM EARTH. It won 
mainstream reviews, was selected by the 
Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club, has 
been optioned to the movies, was chosen 
one of the best books of the year by the 
American Library Association, has lately 
been reissued by Berkley. 

We quote John Boyd further: "I opted for 
science fiction after two writers I particu- 
larly admire — Arthur C. Clarke and Robert 
A. Heinlein — publicly endorsed Last Star- 
ship, and after I received numerous per- 
ceptive letters from its readers. I became 
convinced that the quality of science-fiction 
readership is exceptionally high. Not then or 
since did I ever consider 'writing down' to a 
reader or underestimating his background or 
intelligence. But I had felt that Last Starship 
would have limited appeal because it was 
addressed primarily to literature students in 
the hope that they might be amused by the 
arcane illusions and free-wheeling language. 
Yet the book was received understanding^ 
by science-fiction readers. Thus did Last 
Starship launch me into s-f as surely as it 
launched its hero to Planet Hell. Inci- 
dentally, the translation of the book's French 
title is THE LAST SHIP TO HELL " 

John adds that to the s-f audience, "... a 
valid social promise can be expressed with 
wit, subtlety, indirection, sadness, in- 
dignation and poetic flights of rhetoric, all in 
one tale, and in the expectation of being 
comprehended." 

While not definite in his mind about the 
difference between science fiction and 
mainstream fiction, he does believe the 
science-fiction reader, more than others, is 



prepared in advance for the "willing 
suspension of disbelief" so essential in 
coping with the world of the imagination. 

His chief aim, John reports, is to tell a 
good story with a valid theme and believable 
characters, particularly the latter. Hence in 
writing The Girl and the Dolphin appearing 
in this issue, all through the bittersweet love 
9tory of Celia and Happy he was careful to 
empathize with both. He tells us, further, 
that he usually deliberately telescopes the 
endings of his novels. "Once the plot-strings 
are knotted, I believe in a quick cut right be- 
hind the knot. Any philosophical implica- 
tions the reader may wish to weigh, he can 
weigh without me." Of course, the practice 
can backfire. "One reviewer in the Los 
Angeles Times. I'm convinced, read my 
ORGAN BANK FARM without discovering 
how the protagonists ultimately defeated 
the behavior computer which could plot all 
their moves in advance. You see. their 
method was disclosed in an off-beat 
strategy conference between two surgeons, 
repeated in the gibberings of a schizoid, and 
retold again in a song composed by an 
aphasiac. Too deep for reviewers, I guess. I 
don't consider reviewers to be among my 
most intelligent readers." 

John was a Naval Reserve officer during 
World War II, enlisting from Atlanta, 
Georgia in 1940. He met his wife-to-be 
while stationed in San Diego, married her in 
Seattle in 1944. After graduation from 
U.S.C. in 1947, he became a graphic arts 
salesman and remained so until 1970, when 
he began to write full time. 

THE I.Q. MERCHANT, recently put out in 
hardcover by Weybright & Talley, is John's 
most recently published book. But he has 
completed another fine novel, THE 
DOOMSDAY GENE. It concerns the Ideal 
Man for a Crowded Planet — because he has 
a genetically inbred "death wish." 

THE DOOMSDAY GENE starts in our 
May issue. It will be a two-parter. Have fun.

« y^OOD afternoon, your 
VJ" honor.” The newsman 
rose as Judge M’bui Darrananga 
swept into his chambers, began 
divesting himself of his robes and 
wig. 

The judge’s handshake was cor- 
dial, firm. “Barry, it’s a pleasure to 
see you again. “Sorry to make you 
wait — my charge to the jury took 
longer than I’d expected.” 

“Don’t give it a thought.” The 
newsman winced as Darrananga’s 
huge hand enveloped his own. “I 
appreciate your fitting me into your 
schedule on such short notice,” he 
said. “I realize that the Lew 
trial — ” 

“Isn’t what you wanted to talk 
about,” interrupted the judge with a 
knowing, good-natured smile. 
“Ethically We shouldn’t discuss it 
until the jury reaches a verdict, you 
know.” 

Darrananga stood six and one- 
half feet tall in his blue-black 
skin — his merry, patient eyes 
tended to miss nothing. Robust in 
his early sixties, he had been born in 
a Nairobi slum, disenfranchised 
and meager of prospect as any 
other black urchin. His climb from 
the gutters of East Africa to doctor 
of jurisprudence had culminated be- 
hind a bench in the United Nations 
High Court. There were those who 
insisted witchcraft had had some- 
thing to do with it. 

“You’re aware, of course, that 
the Lew. trial is only a gesture,” 
continued Darrananga, stuffing a 



calabash pipe with rough-cut to- 
bacco he liked to blend himself. 
“Lew Chao Leung surely is no 
murderer — no more than you or I. 
His family forced the trial to satisfy 
their egos, their pride. The jury will 
weigh the evidence — if it can truly 
be called ‘evidence’ — and rule Dr. 
Lew innocent of murder in the 
second degree. Posthumous trials 
are rarely meaningful, I’m afraid.” 

The reporter’s grin was sheepish. 
“I hoped to learn your views on the 
Dallin incident, your honor.” 

“Certainly you did. Everyone else 
is talking about Richard Dallin — 
why shouldn't we?” Applying a 
match to the bole of his calabash, 
Darrananga lolled in the high- 
backed chair behind his desk, sur- 
rounded by a cloud of bluish 
smoke. “We may never learn what 
really happened out there,” he 
mused aloud. “The affairs’ more 
romantic overtones — aided by 
sensational press coverage — have 
kindled public fancy. We have a 
double homicide among working 
scientists in the field, then the 
otherworldly purpose and remote 
lunar farside base of Project Ozma 
itself — next a third death under 
unusual circumstances and finally a 
vanished astrophysicist whose diary 
records visiting aliens from the 
stars. And an incredible work of 
art — the photoscuplt. By the way, 
have you seen the Smithsonian 
exhibit?” 

“Last month,” said the newsman. 
“Washington was a furnace.” 



103 




Darrananga chuckled. “Ah, 
yes — late summer isn’t the season 
to visit the American capital. But, 
didn’t you sense the nearness of the 
unknown in that skylighted gallery, 
Barry? Music pours from hidden 
speakers, making chills race along 
your spine once you know the 
details of the affair.” 

“Music?” The reporter looked 
wary. “I remember the recorded 
music, yes, but — ” 

“In a moment, Barry — in a 
moment,” fended Darrananga. “I 
stood in the Smithsonian for twenty 
minutes, listening, watching the 
queue wind past. Chattering visi- 
tors would approach the pedestal, 
come face to face with that eight- 
inch plastic brick encapsulating 
diminutive, cameo-perfect human 
figurines and become suddenly 
rooted, held by the sort of rapt at- 
tention one finds at a showing of 
Van Gogh or Modigliani. They 
would stand transfixed until crowd 
pressure forced them on — to ask fu- 
tile questions of the guards before 
wandering off, unsatisfied, toward 
the exit.” ■ 

“1 suppose we’re all — unsatis- 
fied.” 

“We are indeed. Tell me — do 
you like music?” The judge leaned 
forward. 

“I — yes, of course.” 

“Sibelius, Beethoven, the heavier 
orchestral literature? Perhaps the 
Bruckner works?” 

The newsman frowned, shifting 
his weight uneasily. “I’m not well 



acquainted with longhair works. 
Why do you ask?” 

Darrananga reflected for a dozen 
heartbeats in silence. He slowly laid 
aside his pipe. “Richard Dallin 
loved music,” he said. “His was a 
sonorous plea for help, a cry in the 
night that may or may not have 
been answered.” The judge paused. 
“Don’t mistake me. There is no 
hint of deception or hoax in the 
Dallin incident — merely mystery, 
just an unsolved enigma. The 
photosculpt rests on its pedestal, an 
affront to reason and common 
sense, while the diary — ” 

“The diary?” 

Judge Darrananga rubbed his 
chin. “The foreman asked for three 
copies of the diary to take into the 
jury room for study,” he said, 
looking directly into the newsman’s 
eyes. “I’ve decided to let you read 
my personal copy this afternoon, 
Barry.” 

The reporter flinched in surprise, 
sat suddenly straighter. “But isn’t 
the diary still considered evidence?” 

“Technically, yes. When the trial 
concludes Richard Dallin’s cel- 
ebrated diary will at last be 
published in its entirety. 
Witholding the final portion to 
keep prospective jurors unpreju- 
diced was silly, to say the least. I’m 
certain the Lew trial is in its last 
hour.” 

The newsman’s eyes widened. 
“Believe me, I’ll consider per- 
mission to preview the diary a great 
privilege, your honor. “May I ask

bluntly — have you formed an 
opinion about Dallin’s fate?” 

“An opinion? As the Lord is my 
witness, I form a new opinion 
daily.” The judge opened the top 
drawer of his desk. He lifted out a 
thick, unbound stack of fascimiles, 
laying them reverently before the 
newsman. “I’ve earmarked those 
entries which seemed most 
pertinent with tape. Read them 
first. They’ll provide an overview. 
Later, if you wish, you may browse 
through the remainder at your 
leisure.” 

“Thank you, Judge Darrananga. 
Thank you very much.” The 
reporter sounded sincere. 

The judge rose stiffly. He 
stretched, strode briskly to the 
door, standing with one hand on the 
knob. “I’ve some calls to make. I’ll 
be back in an hour, or so.” He 
puffed his cheeks, regarding the 
newsman soberly. “Try to retain an 
open mind, Barry,” he said as if in 
afterthought. “Do try.” 

The ' door eased shut. The 
newsman was alone. He eagerly fin- 
gered the first taped tab, then lifted 
and folded back a thick sheaf of 
early pages. At the top of the facing 
sheet was a heading written in 
precise cursive: 

Site VII, Luna — 26 August, 2026 

Here at last! Writing in cubicle 
after dinner. Years from now 
Geraldine & I will read diary 
together & chuckle. All a silly 
diary’s good for anyhow. 



Glad that hellish wait in 
quarantine & tedious crawler ride 
are behind me. Eighteen months of 
hard work & high bonus and I’ll 
strut back to Gerry & Tommy boy 
with a bundle. Joy! 

Met here by Dr. Lew. “Welcome 
to the forty-oners,” says Lew [have 
no idea what he meant]. We invited 
the crawler crewmen in for coffee, 
then saw them off & Dr. Lew 
showed me around the station. The 
600-meter instrument is the stop- 
per, of course [staff calls it simply 
“The Rig”, but actually it’s the 
Karl G. Jansky Radio Telescope]. 
Be a helluva thrill working with it! 

Discovered Dr. Lew stayed 
awake on presumption my arrival 
imminent [absolutely no communi- 
cation with other lunar sites — a sur- 
prise], Mr. Tcharoff now on 
watch — Dr. Butler quietly sleeping. 
They’ve been short-handed — three 
men on rotating eight-hour shifts 
these past months. I had imagined 
four men on station at all times. 

Turning in now. Lew advises that 
Dr. Butler will wake me & give 
formal orientation when he goes on 
watch. Breaking in to routine 
should be fun. Pleasant dreams! 



28 August 

Too pooped to write yesterday. 
Flopped, slept through sacktime & 
most of recreation time. Last sun- 
light hals left the Soviet Mountains, 
hence solar hash gone from sky & 
The Rig will be at maximum useful-

ness this next semi-lunar. We’re at 
27° south latitude. Site III lies 
about 2,700 km northwest in Mari 
Crisium, while totally unexplored 
region around Sea of Moscow lies 
1,400 km or so due north. Isolated. 
But that’s why I’m here. Most 
lunar satellites are in equatorial or- 
bits, below our short horizon. Far- 
side is kept completely free of radio 
noise. Policy will pay off when [if] 
extra-human contact is made. 

Met everyone save Mr. Tcharoff. 
Will meet him next week when Dr. 
Butler reschedules to include me on 
duty roster. Butler, nominal chief 
astronomer, is nearly fifty, has 
goatee, small gray eyes & a sort of 
pompous manner. He kindly com- 
mented on the photosculpt of Gerry 
& Tommy I brought along [should 
be praiseworthy — squandered a big 
chunk of bonus money on it]. 
Figurines are perfectly lifelike & 
edgelighted to make plastic all but 
invisible. 

Checked out in pressure suit 
today. Temperature in surface dust: 
minus 87° F. & falling. Butler is 
laconic as hell, but very explicit 
when technical explanation is 
needed. Duties: [lunar day] main- 
tain transmitter station; house- 
keeping & galley chores [light, 
thank God!]; meteoroid inspection 
of The Rig & transmitting antenna 
station & emergency power & life 
support systems [including our tiny 
crawler]. Lunar night: likewise on 
all counts save meteoroid in- 
spection. 



Sound ambitious? First tour 
showed that a lone man could easily 
handle things. Electronics are 
modularized — we have spares to 
burn. Our only exotic gear: ultra- 
parametric amplifier in receiving & 
The Rig’s drive computer [moon’s 
goofy axial wobble makes this “re- 
finement” manadatory]. 

One other station: emergency 
communications — a joke! FM 
transmitter & vehicles in line-of- 
sight [within range] required to 
relay any/all messages Earthside. 
Butler says proper conditions have 
“happened” once in past fourteen 
years — during some emergency, 
luckily! Lunar orbital traffic is 
entirely below our horizon. We are 
as cut off from all things human as 
it is possible to be & still live. You 
must be here to appreciate this! 

Questioned Butler about rotating 
to Site III now and then to talk 
home. He smiled, explained 
Ozma’s severe financial straits. 
Such “cheating” [invalidating 
contract] would mean paying own 
Earth passage, forfeiture of bonus 
& allotments, reimbursing NASA 
for whopping insurance premiums, 
et cetera. I’d be in hock to NASA 
till baby Tommy or his sons found 
work! 

Resupply crawler from Crisium 
each & every six months [want to 
check & make sure we aren’t 
loafing]. Will bring goodies & mail. 
I’ll have beaucoup letters for 
Geraldine by then. Oh, hell! Over 
two-one & knew my own mind, so

they say. Next resupply date? Un- 
known. Arrival date a forbidden 
topic by mutual consent. 

Did I mention that Dr. Lew has 
medical background as well as 
physics? Burst appendix would be a 
fearsome prospect out here 
otherwise. 



29 August 

Lone watch today. Butler seemed 
satisfied with my performance. Will 
switch staff to six hours watch, 
eighteen hours rest & recreation — 
much easier on everyone. Lew gave 
monthly physical exam after dinner 
& says I’m A-l. Can’t help liking 
Lew. He’s intelligent, infinitely 
patient, precise in movement & 
speech, with clear oriental skin & 
coal-black eyes. 

Our music room’s a luxury [espe- 
cially for me] — the only com- 
partment in the monastery hut kept 
at decent atmospheric pressure [for 
acoustic purposes since all hate 
wearing headphones]. When asked. 
Lew explained faint odor in music 
room as a combination of soupy air 
plus Mr. Tcharoffs pipe [he 
smokes in defiance of rules & 
Butler looks the other way]. 
Gathered Lew not at all fond of 
Tcharoff, but does admit he’s a 
genuine music nut [sounds like 
someone worth knowing]. 

Also logged my first station entry 
today: transmitting Tau Ceti on 
1,430 mHz band, just off natural 
frequency of neutral hydrogen. Star 



some ten light-years distant. May 
hear from them [?] in twenty years, 
who knows? Watched assembled 
platen on raster monitor: number 
theory, value of pi — graphics in- 
clude schematic representations of 
solar system & bisymmetrical 
human form. The Rig receiving 
likewise [frequency of un-ionized 
hydrogen]. 

Letter to Geraldine, then sack- 
time. Tired tonight. Miss Gerry lots 
& lots. 



30 August 

Returned from watch today & 
heard someone singing snatches 
from Boris’ death scene [pulls sharp 
after every second bar] & knocked 
politely to meet the singer. Gregor 
Tcharoff is straight from bad opera 
bouffe — taller, wider than life, 
sporting an auburn beard nesting 
birds might have built & [supposed] 
Rabelaisian gusto. He’s really just 
a gruff kook who thinks his 
charisma sprouts from loud belches 
& a booming laugh, is easily 
amused [mostly by his own dia- 
logue] & damned generous with ad- 
vice on everything. Some fella! 

It seems Butler had mentioned 
my photosculpt, & Tcharoff de- 
manded to see it. He was 
overwhelmed. Geraldine, it de- 
veloped, was the exact image of a 
lost love goddess whom he’d chased 
in Ankara twenty years ago, while 
Tommy was an absolute ringer for 
his favorite nephew back home in 



INTERFERENCE 



107 




Vladivostok. Gregor has one stan- 
dard joke in his repertory: the lunar 
farside is a sort of rare garden spot 
compared to Vladivostok. God, he 
may be right! 

Over coffee he discoursed on 
Olbers Paradox, numismatics, 
homeopathic medicine, orchids, 
French opera, American baseball 
[about which he knows nothing] & 
a few topics I’ve forgotten. Whew! 

He Finally did explain something 
concrete: who the “Forty-oners” 
are. It seems they’re us numbwitted 
jackasses who’ve agreed to eighteen 
months of living burial here on the 
forty-one per cent of Luna’s waste- 
land never seen by Earth — and 
who, conversely, never see home & 
hearth hanging in the sky like a 
blue-silver Christmas tree bauble as 
it does over Site I & the other 
Earthside bases. 

Tcharoff capped the evening with 
a yawn that exposed his entire 
trachea, gave me a friendly blow on 
the shoulder & ambled off to his 
cage to hibernate. He’ll take 
beaucoup getting used to! 

Watch tonight monotonous, 
lonely — six hours seem twelve or 
fifteen. From the control room The 
Rig’s huge dish is limned in star- 
light above the rolling shoulders of 
the Soviets, but stars never crawl to 
westward as they do at home. The 
moon’s a static, sterile dustball. 
Couldn’t shake the idiotic notion 
that Earth did not exist, that this 
blasphemous place was all there 
ever was or would be. Silly! 



Nothing much to occupy my mind 
on watch. Might have spent more 
time listening to Gerry’s misgivings 
about accepting this damn fool 
contract. Sure, a year and a half out 
here is better than three years 
wearing a uniform, & a conscrip- 
tion waiver went with the NASA 
contract. 

Hell! Money’s pouring in. I’ll 
hang in there and get rich! 



1 1 October 

Skipped a couple of days since 
nothing new. Listened to several 
tapes again today: Sibelius, Offen- 
bach, Prokofiev. Great quadra- 
phonic tape library & excellent 
audio equipment. Friend Tcharoff, 
who pooh-poohs Sibelius as a 
composer of “effects” rather than 
serious music, stirred me to lively 
argument again. Bear’s manner can 
get under anyone’s skin. Watch it! 

Not a helluva lot else to report. 
Tcharoff argued at dinner about 
Richard Strauss, but half-hearted, 
mopey. There seems to be a feud of 
sorts going between him & Lew, 
who’s quiet, capable & self- 
contained, while Tcharoffs noisy, 
more or less capable & contained 
by nothing whatsoever including 
self. Butler remains aloof, which is 
slightly worry-making. 

Dreaded going on watch — 
loneliness! Read for a time, but 
couldn’t concentrate. Here two 
months or thereabouts, & it seems 
ten times that. Meals prepackaged.

deep-frozen — quite good, but some- 
thing is missing. Daydreams filled 
with Geraldine & Tommy. Miss 
Gerry terribly at times. Most times. 
Can’t shake scary feeling some- 
thing dreadful has happened to her. 
Would never know it here. 

Turning in. Hope sleep comes 
easily tonight. 

20 November 

Good old 1,430,000,000 hertz for 
27.321661 days this month. Lis- 
tening same frequency. What else is 
new? 

Thought up harmless rebellion. 
Will horse around with higher fre- 
quencies for a few watches. May 
transmit above 8,000 mHz when no 
one’s looking [till Butler catches 
me] & listen same frequency. What 
fun! 

Boredom supreme, & that 
shouldn’t be. Intrinsic fascination 
with Ozma, really. Virtual certainty 
that modulated RF from “out 
there” is falling on every sub-stellar 
point of moon & planets. But at 
what frequency? That’s the jackpot 
question — where to tune for the 
program from Oz? 

Yesterday Lew & Tcharoff got 
into a blistering debate over why 
Ozma ever set up here in backwash 
of universe. Tcharoff, wild & 
woolly — but with a grain of an in- 
stinct for truth — insisted that ultra- 
parametric receiving equipment in 
any airless environs would have suf- 
ficed. Lew patiently pointed out 



that the original intent of Site VII 
was for an RF lab, that Ozma 
moved here with NASA’s decision 
to fund The Rig’s construction. 

Hadn’t known that, nor had 
Tcharoff, who was piqued-plus. He 
flared at Lew unmercifully, wilder 
than ever. He’d had a few, of 
course. Butler found & dismantled 
his latest vacuum still, but the Bear 
must’ve rigged another. His vodka 
tastes/smells like rancid castor oil, 
but high proof plus low p.s.i.g. oxy- 
helium in the hut turns him into 
a rather foulmouthed abominable 
snowman. What can the old man 
do, fire him? Joke! 

On watch one whole cosmic year 
tonight. Really tough staying 
awake. Back in sack, most times, 
equally tough getting to sleep. Miss 
Geraldine beyond telling. Sit for 
hours staring into photosculpt. Do 
idiotic things — jam face up against 
photosculpt to null plastic & make 
Geraldine seem lifesize. Everything 
about Gerry is right & perfect. She 
could almost step out and . 



19 January, 2027 
Yesterday damned eventful. 
Shaken right out of the sack by a 
major quake [we get a steady diet 
of small tremors]. Tcharoff ooohed 
& aaahed & danced around like 
one round-eyed, scared Russian 
while Butler & Lew crammed selves 
into our tiny crawler to survey 
possible damage to station equip- 
ment. 



INTERFERENCE 



109 




Got a scare call from them in ten 
minutes, suited up post haste with 
extra oxy bottles & survival kits. A 
large bolide had smashed into the 
crust less than 7 km from Site VII. 
New crater issuing gas & Butler 
agitated as an old hen. 

Quick-marched upland beside 
Butler [in crawler] toward foothills, 
found some skimpy shade, watched 
& waited. What the hell for? If old 
Luna had decided to gobble up Site 
VII, we had all bought it. 

A few lesser jolts, later. Gaseous 
issue dwindled, stopped. Trekked 
back, pooped, after fifteen hours in 
p-suits. The instant air spilled into 
inner lock chamber we heard the 
communications howler wailing & 
fell all over each other getting our 
fishbowls off. It was the resupply 
crawler from Site III — like 
Christmas cubed! They had been in 
the quake zone & were worried as 
hell when they couldn’t raise us on 
radio. 

All outside to greet them later. 
Bundles & bags of letters from 
Gerry. I have about one trillion 
carefully chosen words to ship 
home. Bedded down after cele- 
bration. Tcharoff uncorked some of 
his best [Butler smiled paternally & 
even had a snort himself]. Much 
later Tcharoff had to be “helped” 
to his sack after being dragged 
away from poor Lew. Gregor gets 
damned boorish on the sauce, spe- 
cially to Dr. Lew. Very, repeat very 
nasty to Lew — the scene embar- 
rassed the crawler boys. Puzzle. 



Lew does nothing obvious to 
antagonize the Bear. 

Afterward read Gerry’s letters 
thrice [little sheep, but what the 
hell]. Says she’s lonely, otherwise 
fine. God in Heaven, if dear 
Geraldine knew the true meaning of 
loneliness! 

In control room on watch when 
the crawler left. Hardest thing yet 
in this life for me was to see it 
shrink to a glittering speck in the 
pass northwest of station. I will not 
see, hear, nor feel contact with the 
rest of human society for another 
half-year. 

22 February 

Still here, Richard? Is the good 
old monastery hut still smelly as a 
locker room at the Y? A hut by any 
name smells just as sweat. Not bad! 
Pretty good poetry for a budding 
young scientist, huh? Still camped 
on Luna’s backside earning my 
fortune. Backside, hell! There’s a 
simpler word for it! 

Vibrating in & out on twenty-one 
centimeters, if anyone cares 
[damned few do!] & still pouring 
that goddam Tcharoff into his sack 
& pulling him away from Dr. Lew. 
Some day he’ll clobber Lew in one 
of his asinine rages. If he does he’s 
in for some lumps of his own, the 
bastard! Butler’s getting more 
concerned. Brilliant man, but 
damned ineffectual. 

Crawler gone more than a 
month. Won’t last my full hitch &

know it thoroughly & completely. 
Next resupply crawler to Site III 
will have a deadhead aboard — 
Richard C. Dallin, dumb [but 
sane!] husband, father, & incipient 
pauper. 

I’ve also been having grade-A 
nightmares. Wake dripping sweat 
after running for hours in p-suit, 
skirting craters & leaping cra- 
terlets, chasing the crawler. But the 
damned crawler keeps churning 
along just out of reach. 

The other’s much worse. Trium- 
phant homecoming in taxi — dash 
madly up the stairs, ignoring 
apartment-house elevator, & un- 
lock the door. There sits Geraldine, 
just as in photosculpt, holding baby 
Tommy on her lap, smiling her 
sunny smile. 

I can’t get in! Chilling wall of 
plastic between us! Beat & push & 
hammer fists raw, but I can’t get in! 
Gerry & Tommy frozen ten paces 
away, not moving. 

Wake screaming after that one. 
Rugged! Meaning to talk to Lew 
about myself again — headaches, 
lapses when I do nothing but worry. 
Going thru senseless motions here. 
Must get to Site 111 — & home! 

28 February 

Third of hitch gone — two-thirds 
to go. Aimless existence from day 
to day to day. If not for music 
room. I’d be in a real tailspin. Go 
there every rec period & drown in 
sounds. Tapes restore something 
precious as food, sleep, or . No, 



I must not even think about that. 

Read some Shakespeare yes- 
terday — he put it neatly: 

When griping griefs the heart 
doth wound. 

And doleful dumps the mind 
oppress; 

Then music with her silver 
sound, 

With speedy help doth lend 
redress. 

Twenty-one centimeters [both 
ways] & Tcharoff badgering Lew 
constantly. I’d like to help Lew. 
But, how? 

3 March 

Sick — gawdawful headaches and 
drowsiness. No watches during past 
two days. Lew gave me onceover. 
Thinks problem psychosomatic & 
gives therapy in form of en- 
couragement — how he supposedly 
felt likewise the first few months. 
Gallant lie, but Lew’s a great guy. 

Don’t understand it — four of us 
all healthy. Can’t infect each other 
with something exotic way out here 
[moon’s controlled indoor envi- 
ronment notoriously low in bacteria 
count, perhaps the healthiest place 
of all human habitation]. Crawler’s 
been gone too long for incubation 
of anything infectious from 
crewmen. 

Better straighten self out! 

15 March 

Tragedy— Gregor Tcharoff is 
dead! 



INTERFERENCE 



111 




Happened while 1 was in sack, 
Butler on watch. Lew & Gregor ob- 
viously had violent argument 
leading to blowoff in dining room. 
Butler came into hut for coffee, 
found Tcharoff with carving-knife 
wound in abdomen. Still breathing, 
but blood, blood everywhere. Lew 
unconscious on floor. Overturned 
table, chairs. Room wrecked. 

Wakened by Butler immediately. 
The old man’s beside himself. Lew 
still unconscious [we were afraid to 
move him], TcharofPs breathing 
stopped at 1950 hours GMT. Had 
disinfected wound, controlled 
bleeding & administered plasma 
from Lew’s infirmary. All we could 
do, I suppose. But not enough. 

Butler fed emergency distress 
tape to FM link, but chance of 
spacecraft in line-of-sight [within 
range] vanishingly small. I don’t 
like Lew’s look — comatose, 
breathing shallow, pulse weak & ir- 
regular. Lack of knowledge how to 
help is killing him. Butler believes 
basal skull fracture from blow, 
possibly fall. Clot also possible. 
What to do? 

17 March 

I am alone! 

Lew’s pulse, respiration faltered 
0415. Tried external heart massage 
& resuscitation. No response. 

Butler left for automated 
Earthside radio relay station in the 
Sea of Smyth at 1500 hours after 
we placed bodies in service shed & 



evacuated air. Horrible thought! 

Small crawler will need lots of 
luck to make it. Butler’s been over 
lunarscape to Site III dozens of 
times, but never to Sea of Smyth. 
He should cover 1,800 km in ten 
days or so — the absolute range 
limit of our little crawler. If he 
makes it there’ll be a ballistic shut- 
tle from Site 1 on the ground here 
within hours. 

If he doesn’t .

Nightmares — afraid to sleep. 
Wandered around, looked behind 
all doors. No one else is here. 
Butler gone long time. Cried, 
Haven’t cried since childhood. 
Couldn’t stop. 

Tcharoff & poor Lew in service

All TcharofPs fault because .

All of them gone & I’m alone!

God help me! Woke trembling

Filthy, unshaven for days — weeks. 
Trouble remembering things & 
scared! 

Also hallucinations, or cruelest 
imaginable joke. Cleaned self up & 
inspected station by way of ap- 
plying nature’s therapy. Thoughts 
that Butler had maybe gotten 
through were reviving & refreshing. 
Tremendously stimulated by hopes 
of rescue.

Checked tapes in receiving & 
heart damned near quit. The Rig

Don’t trust my own judgement

receiving discrete source approxi- 
mate line Gamma Ceti on 8,200 
mHz. Checked, verified tapes. Line 
feed 16452 installed [don’t recall

Went through log for

Didn’t think there would be any, 
but sure enough — 8,200 mHz for a 
few watches when Butler’s back 
turned. If there’s a research vessel 
out there it’s way to hell-and- 
beyond anything I’ve heard about. 
But any hope’s better than none. 
They’ll tune my distress call, crank

J UDGE DARRANANGA threw 
open the door to find the 
newsman standing at the window, 
soberly contemplating the flow of 
water traffic far below in the East 
River. “I have only a minute,” said 
the judge. “The jury is balloting 
now. Tell me truthfully — were you 
impressed?” 

“Beyond words!” The newsman’s 
eyes were hollow. “There are 
several matters — I remember 
reading that Dr. Butler’s body was 
later recovered.” 

The judge leaned on the back of a 
chair, rocking gently. “Heavy- 
handed irony,” he said. “Dr. 
Butler’s tiny crawler almost made 
it. It had tumbled down a talus 
slope bordering the Sea of Smyth 
just eighty-five kilometers from his 
objective. It was discovered by a 
returning selenographical team he 
had passed well within radio range 
when outbound. Dr. Butler rests 
near the lonely outpost that had 
been his charge for so many many 
years.” 

The reporter’s nod was somber. 
“And Richard Dallin? What hap- 
pened to him?” 

Darrananga smiled thinly. “How 
casually you ask the question of 
questions, Barry. The facts are 
these: every automatic service 

device in the monastery hut was 
operating as usual when the resup- 
ply crawler from Site III made its 
routine call, though none of 
quadraphonic audio tapes normally 
stored in the music room, nor the 



114 



GALAXY 




radio telescope’s monitoring tapes, 
could be found. Nothing else 
seemed disturbed. Every pressure 
suit was accounted for by serial 
number, while the pocked, eternally 
silent wilderness around and about 
the station has been scoured and 
searched time and time again.” 

The newsman grunted. He said 
nothing. 

“Which leaves us to dwell upon 
the true enigma — the photosculpt,” 
pursued Darrananga. “The diary 
itself, plus sworn testimony 
furnished by Geraldine Dallin and 
by the California company, Barron 
& Sons, Photosculptors, establish 
beyond reasonable doubt that only 
Mrs. Dallin and her infant son 
posed for the photosculpt on the 
day in question.” 

The newsman nodded. 

“If so,” said Darrananga in a 
solemn tone, “we are confronted 
with paradox. You have seen 
the photosculpt. Imprisoned in 
seamless, rock-hard acrylic resin, 
the six-inch figurine of Geraldine 
Dallin is seated in a cane-backed 
chair, smiling pleasantly, holding 
baby Tommy on her lap.” 

Scowling, Darrananga folded his 
arms across his deep chest. “And 
hunched behind them,” he said, 
“one casual arm resting on his 
wife’s shoulder, crouches the 
emaciated, soul-wrenching figurine 
of Richard Charles Dallin.” 

“I’ve seen,” said the newsman, 
“but—” 

“More concretely,” said the 
judge relentlessly, “microscopic 



examination shows that individual 
skin pores, retinal eye patterns, 
each single strand of the subject’s 
hair and beard are exquisitely 
detailed in a manner totally be- 
yond present day photosculpture 
techniques.” 

“Penalty — most severe!” said the 
newsman hoarsely. 

Darrananga became intent. 
“Was that really the case? Don’t 
leap to conclusions, Barry. Was 
indeed the ‘penalty most severe’ — 
or does compassion take forms as 
yet undiscovered? Either way, 
Richard Dallin is, in a sense, where 
he longed so desperately to be.” 

A light tap on the door caused the 
judge to lift his eyes expectantly. 
“Come in.” 

A bailiff poked his head in long 
enough to say, “Jury’s back in the 
courtroom, your honor. The 
foreman says they’ve reached a 
verdict.” 

“Thank you, Carl.” Darrananga 
donned his robes, his manner 
preoccupied. He spent a moment or 
two adjusting the parliamentary 
wig, then asked, “Did you hear 
him? ‘The jury’s reached a verdict,’ 
he said. I wish to God it were that 
simple!” 

“Amen,” the newsman said. 

Darrananga sighed. “I think 
Richard Dallin’s jury will be out for 
some time. Quite some time.” He 
made ready to leave, turning at the 
door with a curious light in his eyes. 
“Perhaps until the music from 
those missing tapes comes back to 
us from the stars.” ★

path rose steeply to the crest of 
a bank. Beyond the rise the huge 
red segment of the setting sun 
painted the leaves a golden red and 
made even the dancing gnats glow 
with a brazen fire. Droplets from 
earlier rains still glistened on the 
ferns and freshened the air. 

The birds in the nearby trees were 
gathering for the night. Their songs 



fell sharp and melodious on the still 
air. Topping the ridge, the girl 
turned her face toward the sun’s 
last warmth, her eyes nearly closed 
as she savored this moment of al- 
most perfect communion with 
nature. Impulsively she kicked the 
sand in the path, sending it spurting 
ahead of her, the grains glowing as 
they were caught by the golden 
light. 

The man let her pass a few yards. 
He had judged his position to a 



116 



GALAXY 



nicety. The bushy niche in which he 
hid was already covered by the 
evening shade. So careful was his 
step as he came up behind the girl 
that his movements were virtually 
noiseless. The girl herself knew 
nothing of his presence until the 
short axe descended on the side of 
her slim, white neck. She had no 
time even to scream. 

Abruptly the half-orb of the sun 
assumed a more sinister sym- 
bolism. Caught in the grip of blood- 
lust, the man struck again and 
again, following his victim to the 
ground while continuing to strike at 
her with the short axe. The sight 
and the feel of the first blows he had 
struck seemed to excited him 
further. He appeared seized by a 
terrible passion which took a long 
time to find fulfillment. 

Finally the passion was spent. He 
stepped back and examined the 
butchered mess, seeming only now 
to realize that this dead and horri- 
fying thing on the path had scant 
moments earlier been a living, 
breathing, human being. Somehow 
a blood-wet axe was in his hand — 
he stared at it — and his arms were 
shiny and sticky with gore. 

A DISTANT sound carried on 
the still air seemed to make 
him wary. Other people were about 
on this part of the heath and might 
be coming this way. He tore hand- 
fuls of grass off the adjacent bank 
and wiped away the worst of the 
blood from his arms. The axe he 



threw strongly but carelessly into a 
clump of trees to the left of the 
path. He watched it spin away, 
looking relieved. Thousands of 
people had axes like that. He no 
longer possessed one. 

Another sound, nearer this time, 
made him start. He searched 
around accusingly, as if suspecting 
that he was being watched. He 
located no one, but a premonition 
seemed to him that he would be 
unwise to stay. The sun had nearly 
set and his choice of path through a 
line of trees behind the bank threw 
him immediately into a region of 
dimness. The path was twisting and 
winding, but the soft ground under- 
foot left few footmarks and 
returned no noise as he ran. Only 
the little plank bridge across a ditch 
made a sound, but this was lost 
under the great canopy of leaves 
above. 

Emerging on a main path he 
slowed to a walk so as not to attract 
attention. Fortunately the dusk was 
now well advanced and the path 
was empty. Across a short stretch 
of open ground a car was waiting, 
hidden behind the bushes and out of 
sight of the road. He reached the 
car with open relief, took a back 
route winding away through the 
country lanes. He only emerged 
into street-lit areas when passing 
through a town. Knowing that his 
bloodstained clothes and arms 
would not stand close inspection, he 
was careful to avoid any action that 
might have involved the interest of 



CRIMESCAN 



117 




others. Finally he reached an 
expressway and drove fast toward 
home and safety. 

Safely indoors finally, in a small 
suburban house far from the scene 
of the crime, he seemed arrested by 
the sight of himself in the mirror. A 
sick face peered back at him. 

Tseudi 

B EFORE her the narrow sandy 
path rose steeply to the crest of 
a bank. Beyond the rise the huge 
red segment of the setting sun 
painted the leaves a golden red and 
made even the dancing gnats glow 
with a brazen fire. 

“Camera on.” 

Droplets from the earlier rains 
still glistened on the ferns and 
freshened the air, emphasizing the 
sweet scents of the vegetation. 

“Hold that in normal time, 
Tseudi. We’re just coming to the 
critical point.” 

The birds in the nearby trees were 
gathering for the night. Their songs 
fell sharp and melodious on the still 
air. Topping the ridge, the girl 
turned her face toward the sun’s 
last warmth, her eyes nearly closed 
as she savored this moment of al- 
most perfect communion with 
nature. 

“Can you move the lens in closer, 
Tseudi? We need all the detail we 
can get.” 

Impulsively the girl kicked the 
sand in the path, sending it spurting 
ahead of her, watching the grains 



glow in the twilight’s golden light. 

“You won’t get a much better 
view than that,” said Tseudi. 

The prowler let the girl pass a few 
yards. He had judged his position to 
a nicety. The bushy niche in which 
he hid was already covered by the 
evening shade. So carefully did he 
step as he came up behind the girl 
that his movements were virtually 
noiseless. The girl herself knew 
nothing of his presence until the 
short axe descended on the side of 
her slim, white neck. She had no 
time even to scream. 

Abruptly the red half-orb of the 
sun assumed a more sinister sym- 
bolism. Again and again the 
madman lunged, following his 
victim to the ground while con- 
tinuing to strike at her with the axe. 
The horrible blows he had first 
struck seemed to induce into him a 
passion that took a long time to 
find fulfillment. Methodically he all 
but dismembered the body, ap- 
parently relishing the free flow of 
the blood and the sight of mutilated 
flesh and the feel of the axe against 
bone. 

In the Eidochron control room 
the only sound was that of one of 
the technicians being sick. 

When his passion was spent the 
madman stood back and inspected 
the butchery, seeing it as though for 
the first time. The axe in his hand 
and the blood glistening on his bare 
arms became objects of curiosity. 
From somewhere inside him a 
second personality seemed to have 



118 



GALAXY 




emerged and was staring with 
dawning fright and abhorrence at 
the atrocity before him. Yet the 
expression was entirely intro- 
spective — it held no concern or pity 
for the young girl hacked and muti- 
lated on the path. The presence of 
the corpse seemed somehow an of- 
fense against the attacker — had it 
not been there, he would not have 
been at the scene, sweating and 
bloodied and very much afraid of 
being caught and blamed. 

Tseudi’s expression was one of 
fierce concentration as she fought 
with the complexities of the con- 
trols. Under such pressures, her 
own emotions had little time to sur- 
face. For this she was glad. She 
hated to faint in public. 

For the madman escape became 
a predominant motive. A distant 
sound carried on the still air raised 
him to the instant alertness of a 
hunted animal. He tore handfuls of 
grass from the adjacent bank and 
wiped away the worst of the blood 
on his arms. The axe he threw 
strongly but carelessly into the 
clump of trees and bushes to the left 
of the path. He watched it spin 
away thankfully, as though its 
going materially lessened the 
chances of his being connected with 
the act of murder. 

T HE observers also watched the 
flight of the axe. Tseudi swung 
the whole field of vision so ac- 
curately that it covered the entire 
flight path of the weapon up to the 



time it disappeared into the trees. 

“Run it back, Tseudi, and try to 
follow it in,” said Coyne’s voice. 
“That chopper was never found.” 

The screen blurred momentarily 
and the axe returned to the 
madman’s hand. This time he threw 
it with the measured precision of 
slow motion. The axe moved in a 
leisurely arc, the view field 
following it at an apparent distance 
of a few meters. The field of vision 
rose high into the air, tracking the 
weapon over the bushes and down 
into the green cavity beyond. 
Abruptly the axe disappeared. 

Coyne muttered something inau- 
dible and Tseudi again stepped 
back the image and caught the axe 
in midflight to follow it down at 
only a tenth of normal-time rate. 
Soon the answer became apparent. 
In some past mishap or act of van- 
dalism the top of a tall, slim, tree 
had been broken off completely. 
The living trunk had sprouted a 
cluster of new branches near the 
broken crown, but within these the 
main trunk was deeply split. By 
sheer accident the axe had entered 
and lodged within the crevice. 
The protruding handle was indistin- 
guishable from the small branches 
from a half-meter’s distance and its 
height was a good five meters from 
the ground. 

“Good work, Tseudi. The chop- 
per’s probably still up there. No 
one could ever have found it except 
by the purest chance.” Coyne’s en- 
thusiasm somehow never ruffled his 



CRIMESCAN 



119 




persistent calm. “Let’s go back and 
see what happens to our friend.” 

There was another step-back of 
slightly longer duration. The 
madman again watched the axe 
spin away. Sound again caused him 
to start and he glared fearfully 
around the clumps of bushes as 
though he suspected the presence of 
somebody close by. His gaze finally 
came to rest accusingly in the di- 
rection of the Eidochron quasi-lens, 
though he could not possibly have 
seen it. This was a common ex- 
perience for the Eidochron team 
and appeared to relate to some 
latent sixth-sense in some human 
brains for which there was, as yet, 
no scientific explanation. 

Then the fellow began to run. His 
direction took him along a twisting, 
wooded path already shaded under 
the last splash of the dying sun. 
Tseudi’s nimble fingers deftly 
turned the field of view to the new 
direction and tried to follow his 
progress at normal-time rate. Such 
were the technical and manipulative 
difficulties of this maneuver that 
nobody blamed her at all when the 
sortie was halted with the field of 
view showing only a leafy treetop 
caught in the final instants of 
sunset. 

Tseudi tried to relocate her 
quarry from this vantage point by 
scanning down through the 
branches, but either the madman 
had changed his course or his run- 
ning figure could not be resolved by 
the Eidochron lens in the low level 



of available light. Resignedly she 
stepped back the time scan to a 
point where he had been fully in 
view, then tracked him in extended 
time around a serpentine series of 
bends, across a plank bridge and fi- 
nally to where his path was inter- 
cepted by a second track. As she 
had guessed, he had indeed changed 
his course and was now making in 
the direction of the main road. In a 
couple of minutes he was out of the 
woodland and crossing the open 
heath. Tseudi’s job here became 
easier, because she could let him 
walk well ahead, then catch him up 
with a straight sortie, which the 
computers could handle without her 
intervention. 

Soon she could see the car toward 
which the man was heading. It was 
parked behind a hedge, clear of 
observation from the road. Tseudi 
ran the quasi-lens ahead and circled 
the vehicle so that Coyne could ac- 
quire all the photographs and 
details he needed for identification. 
As the madman reached the car she 
froze his image in order to confirm 
that he was indeed the girl’s at- 
tacker. The blood on his arms and 
clothes and the weird expression in 
his eyes left no doubt that he was 
the same man. They now had his 
likeness, the whereabouts of the 
elusive weapon and some details 
about his vehicle. They still needed 
his address and his name. 

H IS driving was fast and erratic, 
but not sufficiently to arouse 



120 



GALAXY 




the attention of other road users or 
the police. As darkness fell, Tseudi 
had virtually nothing to guide her 
other than the dim tail-lights of the 
car as it raced along the park lanes. 
Frequently she had to resort to a 
closeup of the vehicle time-frozen 
into stillness in order to ascertain 
that she was still following the right 
one. As they reached a town the 
street lights made identification 
easier and it was possible to follow 
the car by sight alone despite the 
increase in traffic. Beyond the town 
they met a limited-access 
expressway, again unlit for its 
major portion. Here, among the 
weaving pattern of taillights 
moving from the slower to the fast 
lanes and back, Tseudi lost her 
quarry completely. 

Again and again she stepped 
back in time to where the vehicle 
had entered the expressway and 
tried to follow it through. The com- 
plexity of the traffic pattern 
continued to baffle her and she 
finished following some wrong ve- 
hicle. Coyne, however, was equal to 
the situation. By careful calculation 
he stepped the Eidochron forward 
in time while Tseudi stationed the 
view field at each exit ramp in turn 
to cover the period when their 
quarry was most likely to emerge if 
that was the route he had chosen. 
At the fifth attempt their vigil was 
rewarded. Clearly identified, the 
murderer’s car left the highway at 
the point they were watching and 
Tseudi easily swung the field to 



follow it as it slowed for the side 
roads. 

Then followed a jumble of 
suburban streets, which the driver 
obviously knew well. Occasionally 
Coyne would ask for the tracking to 
be suspended while he searched for 
roadnames and marked out the 
route on his maps. Finally they 
followed the car into a small 
outhouse garage where the 
murderer, now looking tired and 
sick, left it and walked to an ad- 
jacent house. 

The insubstantial quasi-lens 
followed inquisitively through the 
wall. The house was old and poorly 
decorated inside, but it was tidy 
enough and its order showed 
strongly the touch of a feminine 
hand. It was obvious, however, that 
at this moment the murderer was 
its sole occupant. He stopped in 
front of the tall mirror in the foyer 
and examined his appearance with 
horror, apparently haunted by the 
anguished eyes staring back at him 
from the blood-speckled pallor of 
his face. 

Uttering a low moan, he began 
work to repair his appearance. His 
first action was to strip and take a 
bath. Then, wearing fresh clothing, 
he picked up his soiled garments 
and dumped them in a bath of 
warm water with an overdose de- 
tergent. His shoes could not be 
similarly cleaned — these he opted 
to drop into the solid-fuel burner in 
the kitchen. Having progressed this 
far, he went out again into the 



CRIMESCAN 



121 




darkness with several buckets of 
warm water which he poured over 
the plastics cover of the driving seat 
on the car. Apparently satisfied 
that he had removed all traces of 
the crime, he returned to the lounge 
and sat leafing abstractedly 
through a pile of magazines for 
some thirty minutes before he went 
to bed. 

“Now we have the where,” said 
Coyne. “All we need now is the 
name.” 

Tseudi deftly time-stepped 
through to the next morning and 
focused on the doormat. Finally 
some letters were delivered through 
the letterbox. Fortuitously both of 
these fell faceup. One was ad- 
dressed to Mrs. Edith Pennal, the 
second to Roger Pennal, Esq. The 
first was set aside on the shelf when 
the murderer came down in the 
morning. The second one he 
opened. 

“Need any more?” asked Tseudi 
Hyde. Her usually trim brow was 
deeply furrowed. The strain of the 
precise and prolonged operation 
had left her limp. 

Coyne turned up the lights and 
shook his head. “No, I think that’s 
all we need. That was a very good 
run, Tseudi.” 

S HE closed down the control 
panel in front of her and the 
image of Pennal’s doormat faded 
from the screen. At her side Coyne 
was still watching the fading image, 
his calm face full of intelligence and 



comprehension. Tseudi turned. 

“Would you mind if I handled 
the police contact on this one, 
Michael?” 

“Of course not. You know the 
routine. But you’ll do it tomorrow, 
not tonight.” 

“Why not tonight?” The con- 
dition surprised her. 

“Because you’re tired and could 
easily give too much away. And be- 
cause you’ve become emotionally 
involved. You identified with the 
victim and that colored your reac- 
tions throughout the rest of the 
operation.” 

“I thought you said it was a good 
run.” 

“One of the best ever — that’s 
how I know how involved you were. 
You weren’t working to establish 
the truth, Tseudi — you were 
working for revenge. You achieved 
a four-dimensional fix on a target 
moving at a fast transit rate and 
you did so with the ease other 
people drive a car. It wasn’t the Ei- 
dochron that followed Pennal back 
to his house — it was Tseudi Hyde 
making like an avenging angel.” 

His quiet humor brought a tired 
smile from her, soon overlaid by a 
sober consideration. 

“What will happen to Pennal? 
Life imprisonment?” 

“At a guess — he’ll be found unfit 
to plead. But if he does stand trial 
the police may find the case dif- 
ficult to prove. The crime took 
place a month ago remember. The 
blood on the axe handle was wet 



122

and may not have retained prints. 
He burned his shoes, so the foot- 
print casts won’t match anything 
they’ll still be able to find — and 
there weren’t any witnesses. If he 
managed to clean the car properly 
or has since disposed of it, the evi- 
dence will be dangerously thin. 
Unless his conscience gives him 
away it could be that the police 
won’t get a conviction.” 

Tseudi was horrified. “But we 
saw him do it.” 

“Eidochron evidence would never 
be admissible in a court — and even 
if it were I couldn’t make it 
available.” 

“Not even to put a monster like 
that behind bars?” 

“Not even then, Tseudi. You 
know that. When we run the Ei- 
dochron we’re uniquely privileged 
observers of the human scene. We 
also acquire a unique responsibility. 
The more you consider the ethics of 
Eidochron operation, the more ter- 
rible the responsibility becomes.” 

“Terrible?” 

“Certainly. It can go back and 
see things hopefully forgotten. It 
can peer through walls into all the 
private moments of life. It can 
examine in detail all those things 
you never intended other eyes 
should see. The voyeur, the 
blackmailer, the jealous wife, the 
market-research man, the tax in- 
spector and the ambitious politician 
would all use it if they could. That’s 
why they mustn’t ever have access 
to it.” 



“You’re looking only at the debit 
side. Wouldn’t justice be better 
served by having eyewitness access 
to the crime?” 

“Justice, perhaps, but not hu- 
manity. Those controls under your 
fingers contain everything needed 
to support the most horrifying 
tyranny in history. Tales of Big 
Brother pale into insignificance 
compared with the researches an 
Eidochron could do on your life. 
Could you live, could you even 
think, never knowing whose eyes 
were watching, what notes they 
were taking, what conclusions, 
right or wrong, were being drawn?” 

She looked at him steadfastly for 
a long moment, then smiled 
wearily. 

“No,” she said. “You’re right, 
Michael. You always are.” 

“Then you appreciate why I 
won’t let you use the results out of a 
spirit of revenge. Used only for es- 
tablishing the truth, the Ei- 
dochron’s a dangerous toy. Used as 
an instrument for profit or ven- 
geance, it’s a terrifying weapon. Go 
home and sleep on it, Tseudi. Call 
the police only when you feel able 
to give them a dispassionate ac- 
count of the facts. The rest is up to 
them. We daren’t get more involved 
than that.”

HERE’S a girl on the line,

message direct from Crimescan.” 

“Put her through immediately. 
Hullo? Chief Inspector Grattan 
speaking. Who is this please?” 

“The name’s not important, but 
the message is,” said Tseudi. “I’ve 
Crimescan information concerning 
the Kingswood murder case.” 

“I’m afraid I must ask your 
name and address, madam.” 

“And I’m afraid you won’t get it. 
What’s got into you this morning? 
Do you want the information or 
not?” 

“Certainly I want it. But if we 
need any verification it would be 
useful if we knew how to contact 
you.” 

“Forget it. Sorry if I’ve wasted 
your time.” 

“Don’t hang up.” Grattan’s voice 
carried a note of genuine alarm. “If 
you feel you must remain anony- 
mous I’ll accept that. But give me 
the message.” 

“Keep her talking,” said Spier’s 
voice in his other ear. “Promise her 
anything you like, but keep her 
talking long enough for me to trace 
that call.” 

“You don’t have any choice.” 
Tseudi’s voice returned again, 
slightly doubtful. “The information 
concerns the assailant of Patricia 
Wellman, the girl who was hacked 
to death near Kingswood. The 
name of her attacker is Roger 
Pellan.” 

“Hold for a second while I get 
another pencil. That’s better — how 
do you spell it?” 



“P-e-l-l-a-n. And his address 

is. .” 

Grattan took notes in immacu- 
late shorthand, scowling disap- 
provingly at the recording and 
monitoring equipment that clut- 
tered his office and at Spier, whom 
he disliked. Spier was busy at- 
tempting to trace the call. 

“I’ve got that, Miss — er — ” 

“Stop fishing. Chief. I’ve no time 
for games. Listen carefully. The 
murder weapon was a short axe. 
Pellan threw it away at the scene of 
the crime. By accident it became 
lodged in the top of a broken tree, 
the chances are that it’s still there.” 

“If it’s there we’ll find it. 
Anything else?” 

“He wiped his arms on some 
grass from the bank, but the blood 
was the girl’s, not his. There’s a 
path through the trees right near 
the spot. He ran down it, then 
walked left along the major foot- 
path, which is marked on the 
Ordnance Survey map. He had a 
car parked behind the hedge near 
the main road and he used it to 
drive himself home. As far as we 
know he encountered nobody who 
might be able to identify him.” 

“Except you?” 

“Had I been there. Chief, you’d 
have heard about it as soon as I’d 
made the nearest phone — not a 
month later.” 

“I appreciate, your point. Please 
continue.” 

“I’ll give you details of the car. 
Registration number — ”

As he made the notes, Grattan 
turned to see how Spier was 
progressing. The latter was engaged 
in earnest conversation over his 
radio-telephone link. From his 
agitation it was obvious that he was 
nearing his goal but had not at- 
tained it. 

Tseudi’s voice continued. “The 
inside of the car received a lot of 
traces of the girl’s blood from Pen- 
nal’s hands and clothes. He went 
out again later and poured buckets 
of water over the seat. He soaked 
all his own clothes in biological de- 
tergent except for his shoes, which 
he burned in the kitchen stove. 
That’s about all I can tell you.” 

“And you say there were no wit- 
nesses?” 

“None who might have had cause 
to mark the occasion — and none 
who came near enough to make an 
identification likely. Someone 
named Edith Pennal also seems to 
be living at the house, but she was 
definitely not present on the night 
in question.” 

“Would you mind telling me how 
you know all this, Miss — ” 

“Sorry, but that’s all the in- 
formation I have to give. This con- 
versation is ended.” 

A S THE line went dead Grattan 
.. stared speculatively at the 
receiver. Whoever you may be, 
lady, take care of yourself. A lot of 
real mean people are after whatever 
it is you’ve got. 

Spier finished on the radio- 



telephone and came back with a 
sour look on his face. 

“She got away, damn it. She was 
using a public phone in at the rail- 
road station. The railroad police 
managed to get a man there within 
seconds of the call’s ending, but she 
had vanished. We’ve sealed off the 
phone in case she left some finger- 
prints, but we’ve really not much to 
go on.” 

“Do you expect me to say I’m 
sorry?” asked Grattan critically. 
“Whatever Crimescan is, it does a 
real public service — it’s given us in- 
valuable leads on a number of 
tough cases. I don’t see why you 
want to persecute the lady. It’s not 
against the law to give information 
to the police, you know.” 

Spier scowled. “Was she one of 
your regular Crimescan contacts?” 
“One of them, yes.” 

“Then why the hell did you go 
through that business of demanding 
her name? You must have known 
you wouldn’t get it.” 

“It’s standard police procedure,” 
said Grattan obtusely. 

“A warning, more likely. Some- 
thing to make her wary.” 

“You’d find that difficult to 
prove.” 

“Look, you’re not being very 
helpful. Your instructions were to 
give me the fullest cooperation. All 
I get from you is antagonism.” 

“I may have to cooperate,” said 
Grattan. “But that doesn’t mean I 
also have to like what you’re doing. 
I don’t know what you security 



CRIMESCAN

people are up to and I don’t think 
I’d care to know. In my book 
you’re a lot of black bastards who 
seem to think they’re above the law. 
But when one of your boyscout 
charades threatens to foul up the 
most valuable source of in- 
formation I’ve got I definitely begin 
to see red.” 

“That’s your bad luck!” said 
Spier, unimpressed. “I’ve got a job 
to do and not you nor anybody else 
is going to get in the way. Try 
another funny trick like that and 
I’ll break you, Grattan. Now let’s 
play back the recording of that call 
and see if we can get more ideas.” 
“What sort of ideas?” 

“Ideas like who this girl and her 
friends are, where they operate 
from and exactly what it is they use 
to get information that isn’t 
possible to get.” 

“I still don’t see what Crimescan 
has to do with security.” 

“You’re being remarkably thick. 
Chief. Take this case alone — the 
girl says that Pennal went home 
and washed his clothes in biological 
detergent. Was she actually there? 
Doubtful, because girls don’t 
usually associate with a man who’s 
just chopped up one of them. So 
how the hell could she have known 
what type of detergent he used?” 

“I honestly don’t know.” 

“Then I’ll tell you. They’ve got 
something that gives them the 
ability to see through walls. Think 
of the fun you could have with a 
gadget like that in offices or around 



a government security es- 
tablishment. Think of the profit 
you could make. What price would 
you put on official secrets?” 

“Have you any reason to believe 
Crimescan has been used in that 
way?” 

“No. But would you care to bet it 
won’t be? Not knowing what it is or 
who controls it?” 

“I’d be most unhappy right 
now — if I were in power and had 
something to hide. Alternatively I 
might decide that duplicity in 
government had become outmoded 
and root for the formation of the 
first truly honest administration of 
law and order in history. I always 
did have the feeling that 
government secrecy is directed 
more against the people than 
against a possible enemy.” 

Spier’s reply was preluded by a 
look of sheer malice. 

“There’s also a second impli- 
cation. They couldn’t have known 
the murder was going to happen. 
They must have started from the 
murder as an existing fact and 
viewed it retrospectively. In short, 
they can locate a point in time as 
well as space. They can not only see 
what a man’s doing, but also 
everything he’s done. For all I 
know they may be able to see into 
the future as well.” 

“Clean living is the only safe- 
guard,” Grattan said, a hint of 
mischief about his lips. “But there’s 
nothing new about it. The gypsies 
have been playing around with the 



126 



GALAXY 




past, present and the future since 
time began.” 

“This is different. I suspect a 
technological approach, one that 
obviously works.” 

“Then would it be automated 
fortune-telling you’re trying to sell 
me?” 

“Grattan, if you needle me any 
more I’ll crucify you! I’m trying to 
get it through your thick skull that 
these people, whoever they are, are 
a damn sight too clever. There isn’t 
a secret in the country they couldn’t 
find if they wished. And that’s far 
too dangerous a power to leave 
floating around in the hands of 
nameless private citizens, no matter 
how well intentioned.” 

“Meaning that if you government 
people acquire it, it’s perfectly right 
for you to use it to inspect the lives 
of the populace — but if there’s the 
remotest chance that a taxpayer 
might use it on you we have a na- 
tional disaster?” 

“You’re beginning to get the 
point, chum.” 

“And you’re beginning to make 
my stomach crawl. Patricia 
Wellman was hacked to pieces by a 
maniac. It was senseless brutality 
without even rape as a motive. Un- 
fortunately we’ve never been able to 
trace her assailant. He’s free to 
strike down somebody else at any 
time. Now that Crimescan has 
given us his name we can see that 
doesn’t happen.” 

“You make my heart bleed. So a 
girl was chopped up — you’re 



talking about the death of an indi- 
vidual. I’m talking about the se- 
curity of the whole damn country.” 
“You’re dealing in abstractions, 
Spier. My concern is with the facts 
of a murder that’s been commit- 
ted — and the possible prevention of 
another. Crimescan is helping to 
uphold the law and making the 
world a safer place to live in. For 
those of you who work above the 
law I’ve neither time nor sympathy. 
God help the lot of us if things ever 
start going all your way.” 

Spier 

R ATHER than risk a distur- 
- bance of the evidence, it was 
decided to cut the top off the tree. 
Spier’s face had been peculiarly im- 
passive as he watched the cradle of 
the hydraulic hoist swing the saw 
into position. Now, as the broken 
treecrown was carefully lowered to 
the ground and the axe itself be- 
came visible, even he could not sup- 
press a marked reaction. Grattan’s 
photographs of the atrocity had 
made their point. 

Soon the police departed with 
their trophy. Major Spier re- 
mained, walking thoughtfully 
through the area, trying to analyze 
the nature of the device for which 
he was looking. It required vision 
without presence — vision with 
retrospective ability. Neither 
seemed conceptually impossible. 
High-definition electronic-scan ra- 
dar could produce a reasonable 



CRIMESCAN 



127 




image from a moderate distance 
and any form of recording held the 
potential for retrospective replay. 
The ingenious part of Crimescan 
would be the focusing and the 
method of regressing the focal point 
back through time without the ne- 
cessity of having recorded 
everything beforehand. 

Spier shrugged and went back to 
his car. The things being done with 
lasers and electron optics in ad- 
vanced research laboratories never 
ceased to amaze him, even though 
he had an advanced degree in 
physics as a necessary part of his 
qualifications for technical security 
projects. He knew instinctively that 
his analysis of the mechanism of 
Crimescan was naive and im- 
precise, but a fundamental tenet 
clung in his mind. Data trans- 
mission required power — and the 
greater the number of “bits” of in- 
formation transmitted and the 
greater the distance, the greater the 
power requirement had to be. Fur- 
thermore, if the data were acquired 
by the process of interrogating a 
passive element and reading the 
reflection, then the primary 
transmitter would need to radiate a 
very significant amount of energy. 

With this in mind he began a 
search that took him through doors 
only his high security standing 
could open — into various electronic 
research and communications labo- 
ratories, monitoring stations and 
radar establishments. Using as a 
starting point the dates of several 



major crimes that had been the sub- 
ject of Crimescan activities, he was 
looking for records of significant 
transmissions of energy at times 
corresponding to those of the crime 
or at times slightly preceding 
Crimescan’s reports to the police. 
He drew a blank. If such trans- 
missions had existed they occupied 
parts of the radio spectrum not nor- 
mally being monitored. Most of his 
contacts, however, were of the 
opinion that it would be possible to 
detect such transmissions if it were 
known when they were likely to 
occur. 

Spier was not a man who believed 
in chance. He laid his plans with the 
greatest care. The weak link was 
Chief Inspector Grattan and Spier 
set out in person to convert him to 
the cause. Grattan had already been 
advised to offer the fullest 
cooperation — word had come down 
to him from the highest levels. 

Grattan greeted Spier dourly and 
listened to his proposals without 
enthusiasm. 

“Now let me get this straight, 
Major Spier. If I understand you 
correctly you want me to set up all 
the trappings of a major investi- 
gation of a murder that didn’t 
actually happen.” 

“I didn’t say it won’t happen. I’m 
merely saying that what you will 
see will be something that has been 
staged. We’ll present you with an 
apparent case that will meet the re- 
quirements for headlines — the 
victim, the murder weapon and 



128 



GALAXY 




everything needed to make it look 
authentic. All you have to do is fail 
to solve it. We want Crimescan to 
have a go at it. And when they do 
we’ll have our detectors waiting for 
them.” 

“But I’ve already solved it,” said 
Grattan testily. “You’re respon- 
sible — and I can think of 
nothing I’d enjoy more than getting 
you put away for life.” 

“I need hardly tell you the case 
would never get to court.” 

“Where would you get this — 
ah — victim?” 

“That’s my worry, not yours. All 
we need from you is the touch of 
realism that will bring Crimescan 
into action.” 

“You mean to tell me you’d 
actually take a life in order to trap a 
public benefactor?” Grattan was 
incredulous. 

“You know how highly security 
rates possession of Crimescan. We 
have to get hold of it somehow. It’s 
nothing to you where the body 
comes from or where it goes.” 

“That’s where you’re wrong. I 
care very much where it comes 
from. I wouldn’t be a good po- 
liceman if I didn’t. If you’ve got the 
sort of immunity that places you 
above moral law as well as above 
the law of the land I suggest that 
you appeal to the Almighty for 
help — not me.” 

“Don’t try to fight me, ” said 
Spier. “You’re going to help me — 
and you know damned well why.” 

“Oh, that? The resignation bit? 



Well I’ve certainly no intention of 
resigning just to suit your con- 
venience. If I’m disciplined for dis- 
regarding ‘friendly’ advice from up- 
stairs — that’s a different matter. 
Other people, too, will then have 
their consciences to examine.” 
“Then you won’t cooperate?” 

“I’ll treat a murder case as a 
murder case. If I can solve it, I will. 
If I run out of luck — then I’ll hope 
that Crimescan will step in with 
some answers. I’ll go no farther 
than that.” 

“That’s not good enough,” said 
Spier. “I’ll have to work with some- 
body more amenable. You’ll find 
your duties have been reorganized, 
Chief. I advise you to take the hint 
and resign. Otherwise you might 
find the going rather tough.” 

“I’ll see you in hell first,” said 
Grattan. 

Coyne 

F JIETR LAZLO, unshaven for 
three days and sought for his 
gambling debts for ten times 
longer, reacted to the knock on his 
door as a man with less on his mind 
might react to the finding of a poi- 
sonous snake in his bed. Instantly 
alert and trembling violently, he 
searched around for a makeshift 
weapon or an avenue of escape. He 
found neither. 

“Open up, Lazio. We know 
you’re there.” 

“No!” Lazio’s voice came out as 
a hysterical squeak. “I need more

time. Maxine promised me.” 

“Maxine’s given you all the time 
you’re going to get, Lazio. Now she 
wants blood. Are you going to open 
this door or do we have to kick it 
down?” 

“For God’s sake — I’ll get the 
money! I promise I’ll get the 
money.” 

“Where from?” 

A blow on the door splintered the 
wood around the lock. Wildly 
Lazio scanned the room for any 
conceivable means of defense. An 
ancient marble-topped washstand 
seemed to offer the only chance. 
Fortunately the marble was no 
longer secured to the wood and the 
heavy slab came away easily in his 
frantic hands. He stationed himself 
behind the door, the slab raised 
above his head. 

The door flew open with a crash. 
There was a blur of somebody 
following it rapidly into the room 
and Lazio struck with all his 
strength. The descending slab 
caught the intruder squarely on the 
head and crushed his skull, killing 
him instantly. As he fell to the 
ground a gun clattered across the 
floor. Lazio dived low and followed 
the gun, recoiled like a cobra, the 
weapon in his hands. 

Somebody shouted a hoarse 
warning. As Lazio turned to fire, 
two bullets from outside the door 
dropped him even as he pulled the 
trigger. His shot went wide and 
buried itself in the wall. A brief 
buzz of argument became audible 



outside the apartment, was 
followed by the sound of a panicky 
exodus. From a lower stair landing 
came the discernible words: “It was 
self-defense — him or me. Maxine 
shouldn’t have let that gunhappy 
bastard come along. It had to cause 
trouble — ” The slam of the front 
door returned the house to silence. 

Tseudi froze the action at that 
point and looked at Coyne for 
guidance. Coyne was leafing 
through a file of newspaper clip- 
pings with a frown of mystification. 

“I wonder what’s going on, 
Tseudi. We know Pietr Lazio was 
shot, but there’s no mention in the 
press of the man who had his head 
crushed. There’s been some sup- 
pression of information here. 

“A D-notice?” asked Tseudi, re- 
ferring to the news-media censor- 
ship document. 

“Possibly. Though I don’t see 
any political or security implica- 
tions here. I suppose it could be 
that the authorities knew who the 
other dead man was and had 
reasons for not wishing him impli- 
cated. But why suppress only half 
the story and not all of it? Back 
track on him, Tseudi, and let’s see 
where he came from. It could be 
you were right — that Grattan was 
trying to warn us.” 

“Right.” With nimble fingers she 
reversed the time sense, and after 
an appropriate delay the body 
sprang back from the floor, the 
marble slab was lifted away from 
his repairing skull. He blurred 



130 



GALAXY 




backward and out. The door closed 
and repaired its splintered wood- 
work. Tseudi swung the Eidochron 
lens through the door and surveyed 
the faces of the men on the landing. 

C OYNE held up his finger for a 
momentary halt. Tseudi froze 
the image and moved in for a close 
up of the man who had never been 
reported dead. 

“Mean anything?” she asked. 
“The face is vaguely familiar, but 
I can’t place him. Certainly he had 
nothing to do with gambling. I’d 
swear I’ve brushed shoulders with 
him at technical conferences — but I 
don’t see how he comes to be in this 
sort of company.” 

Tseudi concentrated then, intent 
on the difficult manipulation of 
following three men down the stairs 
through all the three physical di- 
mensions while still holding 
reversed normal-time congruency. 
Outside the house, where the men 
drove off backward in a car, she 
had to slow the image considerably 
in order not to lose track of them in 
the traffic. Fortunately this time 
she was able to track the car by 
daylight. 

up near a small drinking and 
gaming club and all three men went 
in backward. Tseudi was just about 
to make the quasi-lens follow when 
their particular quarry came out 
alone, entered the car again and 
backed down the street. His retreat 
took him not home, as Tseudi had 
anticipated, but finally into the 



gates of an electronics research 
establishment. 

This was the first time Tseudi had 
ever heard Coyne swear. 

“What does it all mean?” 1 ■ . ^ 

“It’s a trap, Tseudi. And we’reln 
it. I’ve just remembered who our 
mysterious body is. He’s Major 
Spier — a scientific security man. 
He’s usually behind the scenes at 
international conferences and he’s 
made it possible for a number of 
scientists to defect from behind the 
Iron Curtain.” 

“Then what’s he doing in this 
instance?” 

“Provoking a murder incident — 
with a top electronics radiation lab 
primed to locate our Eidochron 
transmissions. A curious touch of 
poetic justice that — he got himself 
killed in the process.” 

“Hence the D-notice,” said 
Tseudi. “But that was a month ago. 
If they had been able to locate us 
they would surely have been here 
long ago.” 

Coyne shook his great, gray 
head. “No. At that time they would 
have been able to detect only the 
eido-refringent lens response — and 
that would have given a signal at 
the scene of the crime and 
everywhere we’ve traveled this 
morning. They could have been 
certain that Crimescan would 
investigate, but they couldn’t have 
located us until now. Our danger is 
the interrogation transmission 
we’re putting out at this moment. 
How long have we been on the air?” 



CRIMESCAN 



131 




“Ninety-six minutes all told.” 
“More than enough time for 
them to have gotten a fix on us. I’m 
sorry, Tseudi, but this is the end of 
Crimescan. The game’s over.” 

H IS face registered no par- 
ticular emotion as he reached 
past Tseudi’s shoulder to press the 
button marked destruct. What- 
ever bitterness he might have 
felt was swamped by the generous 
tide of his own maturity. 

“It’s a pity it had to come to this. 
Twenty minutes, Tseudi, to get 
clear. There won’t be much damage 
outside the building, but inside 
there’ll be very little left.” 

Tseudi began to close down the 
control panel, but Coyne stopped 
her gently. 

“Let it run. It can make no dif- 
ference now.” 

He slipped into the control seat 
and began resetting the controls for 
a forward scan of their own lo- 
cation only an hour away in future 
time. Tseudi seized her handbag, 
gathered her coat and made ready 
to depart with the other techni- 
cians. Then, on seeing Coyne still 
seated at the controls, she came 
back to him. 

“Aren’t you coming, Michael?” 
“I’ll be leaving shortly,” said 
Coyne. “First I have to make sure 
that there’ll be nothing left after 
destruct that would enable the Ei- 
dochron ever to be rebuilt. It’s a 
terrible toy we’ve been playing 
with, you and I. Something I can’t 



let fall into the hands of less 
responsible people. You run 
along, Tseudi — and thanks for 
everything!” 

Finally alone, Coyne carefully 
scanned the charred and blasted 
wreckage of the equipment rooms 
after destruct, nodding with ap- 
proval as he saw the destruction 
had been as absolute as he had 
planned. The twin elements of his 
genius, the eidorefringent lens pro- 
jectors and the time-scanning grids, 
were smashed beyond the possi- 
bility of recovery or analysis of 
their function. Apart from con- 
firming that the device once had 
existed, the ruins of the Eidochron 
would contribute nothing to anyone 
wishing to recreate the process. 
Even the microfilmed drawings and 
documents had been vaporized by 
the aluminothermic fuses built into 
the storecase and the cabinet itself 
was reduced to a block of metallic 
slag. 

One possibility remained — one 
factor that even yet held all the in- 
formation necessary to rebuild the 
Eidochron from first principles. 
For a long while Coyne could not 
locate what he was looking for. He 
gave a sigh of relief when he found 
it — the image of his own body dead 
among the ruins of the control 
room. He sat back in the chair and 
waited quietly for the installation 
around him to disintegrate. He 
found some consolation in the fact 
that even in death his image had 
still been softly smiling. *

THE LAST HUNT 



A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 



I 

G RIMES stood at the wide 
window of his office, which 
overlooked the Port Forlorn 
berthing apron, watched the star- 
ship New Bedford coming in. She 
was a stranger to the Rim Worlds. 
According to Lloyd’s Register she 
was owned by the Hummel Foun- 
dation of Earth. The Foundation, 
Grimes knew, had been set up 
for the intensive study of xeno- 
biology — its Interstellar Zoo, 
covering hundreds of square miles 
of Australia’s Central Desert, was 
famous throughout the galaxy. Al- 
most equally famous was New Bed- 
ford’s master, Captain Haab. He 
was both master astronaut and big 
game hunter — an unlikely com- 
bination, but a highly successful 
one. 

And what was Captain Haab 
doing out on the Rim? 

Grimes could guess. 

Slowly New Bedford dropped 
down from the clear sky — her ar- 
rival had coincided with one of Port 
Forlorn’s rare fine days. She 
gleamed dazzlingly in the bright 
morning sunlight. As she gradually 
lost altitude the beat of her inertial 
drive rose from an irritable mut- 
tering to a noisy, unrhythmic drum- 
ming, frightening the snowbirds — 
which at this time of the year in- 
fested the spaceport — into glit- 
tering, clattering flight. 

The commodore picked up bi- 
noculars, studied the descending 



ship. He already knew that she was 
modified Epsilon Class, but was 
interested in the extent of the modi- 
fications. She looked more like a 
warship than a merchantman, the 
otherwise sleek lines of her hull 
broken by turrets and sponsons. 
Most of these seemed to be recent 
additions. She must have been spe- 
cially fitted out for this expedition. 

No doubt, Grimes thought. Cap- 
tain Haab would be visiting him as 
soon as the arrival formalities were 
over and done with — it would be 
more of a business than a courtesy 
call. But everything was ready. The 
files of reports were still in Grimes’ 
office, the spools of film, the three- 
dimensional charts with their plot- 
ted sightings and destructions. If 
Haab wanted information — which 
he almost certainly would — he 
should have it. 

New Bedford was almost down 
now, dropping neatly into the 
center of the triangle marked by the 
brightly flashing red beacons. Al- 
ready the beetlelike ground cars of 
the spaceport officials — port cap- 
tain, port health officer, customs — 
had ventured on to the apron, were 
waiting to close in. But Haab, with 
all the resources of the Hummel 
Foundation behind him, would 
have no trouble in obtaining inward 
clearance. 

New Bedford was down at last. 
Her inertial drive complained for 
the last time, then lapsed into 
silence. A telescopic mast extended 
from high on her hull, at control

room level, and from it broke out a 
flag that fluttered in the light 
breeze. It was not, Grimes realized, 
the houseflag of the Hummel Foun- 
dation, a stylized red dragon on a 
green field. This standard was white 
''"1 ndjblue 

NmsWalton, Grimes’ secretary, 
had come to stand with him at the 
window. “What a funny ensign — 
what is it supposed to be? It looks 
like an airship, a blimp in a blue 
sky — ” 

The commodore laughed. “I 
think that the blue is supposed to 
represent sea, not sky. And that’s 
jiot a blimp — ” 

“What is it, then, Commodore?” 

“It could be a white whale,” 
Grimes told her.

APTAIN HAAB to see 
you, sir,” announced Miss 



Walton. 

Grimes looked up from his desk 
where he had been blue-penciling 
the stores requisition sent in by the 
chief officer of Rim Percheron. 
“Show him in,” he told his sec- 
retary. 

The girl returned to the office 
followed by Haab. The master of 
New Bedford was a tall man, thin, 
towering over the little blonde. 
There was an oddly archaic cut to 
his tightly fitting black suit, to his 
stiff, white linen and black stock. 
His face was gaunt and deeply tan- 
ned between his closely cropped 
black hair and black chin beard. 
His eyes were a startlingly pale 



blue. He walked with a peculiarly 
jerky motion and from his right leg 
came a strange faint clicking noise. 

Grimes rose to his feet, extended 
his right hand. “Welcome to Port 
Forlorn, Captain.” 

Haab took the commodore’s 
hand in his own almost skeletal 
claw. “Thank you, sir.” 

“Sit down. Captain. Tea? 
Coffee?” 

“Coffee if I may, Commodore. 
Black.” 

“Will you attend to it, please, 
Miss Walton? Black coffee for two. 
And did you have a good voyage 
out, Captain?” 

“A quiet voyage.” 

“First time I’ve seen anybody 
from the Hummel Foundation out 
here. Of course, we haven’t much in 
the way of exotic fauna on the Rim. 
Not on the man-colonized planets, 
that is. Most of our animals were 
raised from Terran stock.” 

“I’m not concerned with any of 
the life forms actually on the 
planets, Commodore.” 

A grin softened Grimes’ craggy 
face. “I can guess what you’ve 
come for, Captain — ” Miss Walton 
brought in the coffee tray, set it on 
the desk. Grimes said to the girl, 
“Would you mind having the pro- 
jection room ready? You know the 
films we shall want — those that the 
admiralty lent me.” 

“The ones shot on the Lorn- 
Llanith route, sir?” 

“Of course.” 

“Very good, sir. Oh, would you 



136 



GALAXY 




mind if I asked Captain Haab a 
question?” 

“Go ahead. Miss Walton.” 

The girl addressed herself to New 
Bedford’s master. “I’m interested 
in flags, sir. What is the one that 
you have flying from your ship?” 
Haab smiled thinly. “It’s my own 
personal broad pennant. The Foun- 
dation allows me to wear it.” 

“But what is it, Captain?” 

“A white whale,” replied Haab. 
“As I’ve already told you,” 
grunted Grimes. “And now will you 
get those films ready?” 

“And could you fill me in while 
we’re waiting?” Haab asked 
Grimes. 

“Of course, Captain. I’ll start at 
the beginning.” 

<< AS YOU KNOW,” said 
-tl Grimes, “we operate light- 
jammers on the run between the 
Rim Worlds and the Llanithi 
Consortium. The lightjammers are 
the only ships that can have their 
atomic charges reversed so that 
they can land on the anti-matter 
worlds without blowing them- 
selves — and anybody else within 
ten thousand miles — to glory. The 
lightjammers had been running into 
trouble — a strange vessel kept ap- 
pearing on a collision course, 
shoving them away to hell and gone 
off trajectory — ” 

Haab smiled. “You’ll probably 
be hearing from the Rhine Institute 
about that. But the Hummel Foun- 
dation is concerned with living 



beings, not ghosts, not even such fa- 
mous ghosts as the Flying 
Dutchman.” 

“Just as well. Since the navy 
started cleaning up the shipping 
lanes old Vanderdecken has been 
conspicuous by his absence. Maybe 
he’s found a home on Atlantia. 
They still go in for sail in a big way 
there. 

“Well, after the first reports 
came in I decided I’d better see for 
myself, so my wife and I took 
passage from Lorn to Llanith in 
Pamir. At that time it was thought 
that the Flying Dutchman was 
another lightjammer, a foreign ship 
snooping on our trade routes. But 
we had with us the Reverend 
Madam Swithin of the United 
Primitive Spiritualist Church, 
going out to Llanith as a 
missionary. Thanks to her we found 
out what the Flying Dutchman was 
and that Vanderdecken was 
warning us about something. 

“So I grounded the lightjammers 
and sent a report to Admiral 
Kravitz, urging him to make a full- 
scale investigation. He did. Luckily 
our fleet was out on maneuvers at 
the time so it all fitted in with the 
war games that were being played. 
Instead of the usual Redland versus 
Blueland it was the armed might of 
the Confederacy versus the Menace 
from Intergalactic Space. Mphm.” 

Haab registered strong disap- 
proval. “Not a hunt,” he growled, 
“but a military operation — ” 

“Of course. If one of our light- 



THE LAST HUNT 



137 




jammers had run into a herd of 
those things — or even a single 
one — there would have been a 
shocking mess. Don’t forget that 
the Erikson Drive ships, unlike the 
Mannschenn Drive jobs, remain in 
normal space-time while accel- 
erating to the velocity of light and 
return to NST when decelerating. 
The energy eaters — ” 

“Is that what you call them?” 
“What else? The energy eaters 
were a menace to navigation and 
they were dealt with as such.” 

“I still don’t like it.” 

“You’re not master of a lightjam- 
mer, Captain. Oh, all right, all 
right, you’re a big game hunter as 
well as being a shipmaster. But the 
EEs don’t have nice, horned heads 
that you can hang on the wall. They 
don’t have pretty pelts that can be 
made into fireside rugs.” 

“I want a living specimen.” 

“I doubt if your marvelous zoo in 
Central Australia would be able to 
accommodate it.” 

“A zoo need not be on a 
planetary surface. Commodore. 
The plans for an orbital zoo have 
been drawn up, with lines of mag- 
netic force among a grouping of 
small artificial satellites forming 
the bars of a cage. If I capture' a 
specimen the Foundation will have 
everything ready for its reception 
when I get it back to Earth.” 

"If you capture a specimen. The 
navy’s doing a good job.” 

Haab inhaled deeply from the 
villainous black cigar that he was 



smoking as a counter measure to 
Grimes’ foul pipe. He withdrew the 
thing from his mouth and his right 
hand, holding it, rested on his knee. 
Grimes sneezed. There was more 
than tobacco smoke in those acrid 
fumes. 

He said hastily, “You’re setting 
yourself on fire, Captain.” 

The other man looked down at 
the little, charred circle in the cloth 
of his trousers, beat out the embers 
with his left hand. 

Grimes said, “You must feel 
deeply on the subject. You didn’t 
notice that you were burning 
yourself.” 

“I do feel deeply, Commodore. 
But this leg’s prosthetic. I lost the 
original on Tanganore when a har- 
pooned spurzil took retaliatory 
action. The Tanganorans fitted me 
out with this tin leg and, by the time 
I got back to Earth where I could 
have had a new fiesh-and-blood one 
grown, I’d gotten used to it. In any 
case — I couldn’t spare the time for 
a regeneration job.” 

“Tanganore? That’s in the 

Cepheid Sector, isn’t it? And what 
is a spurzil?" 

“A sort of big armor-protected 
whale. White.” 

“And now you’re hunting 

Moebius Dick himself.” 

“Moebius Dick, Commodore?” 

“I thought that your private flag 
was supposed to represent the 
original Moby Dick.” 

“No. It represents the spurzil 
that took a piece of me. It’s a re- 



138 



GALAXY 




minder to myself to be careful. But 
Moebius Dick?” 

“Wait until you’ve seen the films, 
Captain Haab.” 

G RIMES sat with Haab in the 
darkened projection room 
and Miss Walton started the pro- 
jector. Slowly the screen came alive 
and in it glowed words: operation 

RIMHUNT. FOR EXHIBITION TO AU- 
THORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. 

The credit titles were succeeded 
by a spoken account of what was 
happening, by some quite good 
shots of lightjammers arriving at 
and departing from Port Erikson, 
by an excellent shot of Herzogin 
Cecile making sail. The voice of the 
commentator said, “But these 
ships, the pride of our merchant 
navy and the first vessels success- 
fully to trade with the anti-matter 
Llanithi Consortium, discovered 
that all was not plain sailing.” 
Grimes contrived to wince audibly. 
“A new menace appeared on the 
trade routes and only by taking vio- 
lent evasive action were the light- 
jammers able to escape certain 
destruction.” 

“No mention of Vanderdecken,” 
commented Haab. 

“Our navy refuses to believe in 
ghosts,” Grimes told him. “Their 
psychologists have a marvelous 
theory that the Flying Dutchman 
was no more than a projection of 
our own precognitive fears, a visual 
presentation of a hunch.” 

The commentator went on: 



“Commodore John Grimes of the 
Rim Worlds naval reserve — also 
astronautical superintendent of 
Rim Runners — was a passenger 
aboard the lightjammer Pamir. He 
was in her control room when the 
master, acting upon a hunch, trim- 
med his sails in order to make a 
large alteration of course to 
port — ” 

“I like that!” snorted Grimes. “I 
had to bully the stubborn bastard 
into making that alteration.” 

“ — deciding that there must have 
been some unseen danger ahead of 
the ship, Commodore Grimes made 
a report to Admiral Kravitz, 
recommending that a thorough 
survey be made of the trade routes 
between Lorn and Llanith. At the 
time the fleet was out on maneuvers 
off Eblis and the frigates Rim Cul- 
verin and Rim Carronade were 
"detached to carry out investigations 
in the neighborhood of Llanith.” 

The last shot of a lightjammer 
under sail faded from the screen, 
was replaced by one of a conven- 
tional warship proceeding under 
Mannschenn Drive, obviously 
taken from a sister ship. In the 
background glowed the warped, 
convoluted Galactic Lens, an oval 
of luminescence twisted through 
and into an infinity of dimensions. 
The outline of Rim Culverin herself 
was hard and clear. 

“Arriving at the position in 
which, according to Commodore 
Grimes’ report, the danger was 
thought to exist, Rim Culverin and 



THE LAST HUNT 



139 




Rim Carronade reduced to cruising 
speed and initiated a search pat- 
tern. Both vessels, of course, had 
their mass proximity indicators 
tuned to maximum sensitivity. 
Eventually a target was seen in the 
screens, the indications being that it 
was something extremely small, 
with barely sufficient mass to 
register. It must be pointed out, 
however, that collision with a 
dust mote at a speed close to that 
of light could have serious 
consequences — ” 

“How do your lightjammers 
guard against that?” asked Haab. 

“We don’t. Cosmic dust is some- 
thing that we don’t have any of out 
on the Rim.” 

“What about hydrogen atoms? 
Wouldn’t they be as bad?” 

“We don’t have any of those 
either — or the operation of light- 
jammers would be impossible. But 
look!” 

“ — inertial drive only, Rim Cul- 
verin and Rim Carronade ap- 
proached the target with caution. 
Radar had been put into operation 
when the ships made their reentry 
into normal space-time and proved 
more effective than the mass 
proximity indicator had been. The 
original target was resolved into a 
cluster of targets, each presenting 
an echo in the screen equivalent to 
that given by a small ship, such as a 
scout. Furthermore, as the range 
decreased to a hundred kilometers 
and less, the targets could be seen 
visually.” 



In the screen was what looked 
like a star cluster, bright against the 
intergalactic nothingness. 

“The cautious approach was 
continued — ” 

The effect now was more like a 
swarm of fireflies than a star 
cluster. The points of light were in 
rapid motion, weaving about each 
other in an intricate dance. The ship 
from which the film had been taken 
was approaching the shimmering 
display — probably magnification 

was being stepped up at the same 
time. If it were not — then the ap- 
proach was far from cautious. 

Each of the dancing lights 
possessed a definite shape. 

“Haloes,” murmured Haab. 

“Not haloes,” Grimes told him. 
“Look more closely. Captain.” 

Nonetheless, haloes they could 
have been, living annuli of 
iridescence — but twisted haloes. As 
they rotated about their centers 
they flared fitfully, seemed to 
vanish, flared again. 

“What do they remind you of?” 
asked Grimes. 

“The antenna of a Carlotti 
beacon or transceiver,” replied 
Haab after a moment’s thought. 
“But circular, instead of elliptical — 
that’s what I thought when I saw 
the stills that the Survey Service 
passed on to the Foundation. It’s 
more obvious when you see the 
things in motion.” 

“In other words,” said Grimes, 
“a Moebius Strip. But watch.” 

The voice of the commentator 



140 



GALAXY 




came up again. " Rim Culverin dis- 
patched a drone to make a closer 
investigation — ” 

There was a shot of the little 
craft — a spaceship in miniature, 
bristling with a complex array of 
scanners and antennae — pulling out 
and clear from the parent ship. Rim 
Carronade s camera tracked her 
until she was too distant for details 
to be distinguished. Then this pic- 
ture was replaced by the one seen 
by the probe’s electronic eyes. The 
small unmanned craft was making 
a close approach to ohe of the 
whirling rings of light. The enig- 
matic thing was almost featureless, 
although flecks of greater lu- 
minosity on its surface were indic- 
ative of its rotation. It was a 
Moebius Strip made from a wide, 
radiant ribbon. It flared and dim- 
med like an isophase beacon with a 
period synchronized with that of its 
revolution. It could have been a 
machine — yet it gave the im- 
pression that it was alive. It filled 
the screen, spinning, pulsing — and 
then there was blackness. 

The commentator said in a mat- 
ter of fact voice, “The drone went 
dead. It had not been destroyed, 
however. Powerful telescopes and 
radar aboard both ships could still 
pick it up. But it was obvious that 
all its electronic equipment had 
suddenly ceased to function. 

“It was obvious, too, that the 
cluster of mysterious entities was 
approaching the frigates at high ve- 
locity. Captain Laverton, aboard 



Rim Carronade, ordered a 
withdrawal from the scene. Rim 
Carronade and Rim Culverin 
proceeded west, first at normal 
cruising speed, then increasing to 
maximum inertial drive ac- 
celeration. But the hostile beings 
steadily decreased the range. Rim 
Carronade and Rim Culverin were 
obliged to open fire with their stern- 
mounted laser cannon — ” 

II 

T HE screen showed the false 
star cluster again, but its indi- 
vidual components were no longer 
dancing about each other, main- 
taining a globular formation — 
they were holding a steady trajec- 
tory. They were no longer al- 
ternating between light and 
darkness. Every now and again they 
would flare into increased 
brilliance, which did not diminish. 

“Realizing that laser was an en- 
couragement rather than a deter- 
rent,” the commentator went on, 
“Captain Laverton decided to take 
evasive action and ordered the 
starting of the Mannschenn Drive 
units aboard his ship and Rim Cul- 
verin, reasoning that once the frig- 
ates were out of synchronization 
with normal space-time the hostile 
entities would be unable to press 
home their attack. At first -it 
seemed that these tactics would be 
successful, but after a lapse of no 
more than fifteen seconds the things 
reappeared at even closer range 



THE LAST HUNT 



141 




than before, obviously matching 
temporal precession rates. Captain 
Laverton returned to normal space- 
time briefly — and in the few 
seconds before he restarted his 
Mannschenn Drive, just as the 
entities reappeared off Rim Car- 
ronade's quarter, launched a tor- 
pedo with a fission warhead fused 
for almost instant detonation. This 
defensive action was successful.” 

The screen displayed a fireball of 
incandescent plasma, expanding 
and thinning, the obvious aftermath 
of an atomic explosion in deep 
space. Through the cloud of 
glowing gases could be seen only a 
mere half dozen of the entities — 
earlier there had been at least fifty 
of the things. 

“Returning to NST, Captain 
Laverton observed that the ma- 
jority of the creatures had been 
destroyed and that the few sur- 
vivors were sluggish and — he 
thought erroneously — badly in- 
jured. Two were dispatched by laser 
fire. The remaining four retreated 
rapidly, eluding the frigates. 

“The first phase of Operation 
Rimhunt was over.” 

“The next spool, sir?” asked Miss 
Walton. 

“Not just yet, if you don’t mind,” 
replied Haab. Then: “1 beg your 
pardon. Commodore. But I’d like 
to talk about what we’ve just seen 
first.” 

“Talk away, Captain.” Grimes 
refilled and lit his pipe. “Talk 
away.” 



“As you know, Commodore, I’ve 
seen the stills and read the reports 
that your navy passed on to the 
Federation Survey Service, that the 
Survey Service, in its turn, passed 
on to the Foundation. I was present 
at most of the conferences of the 
Foundation’s boffins. I didn’t 
understand all they were saying, but 
I caught the general drift. The 
energy eaters, as they dubbed them, 
are just that. Their peculiar 
Moebius Strip configuration 
ensures that their entire surface is 
exposed to any source of radiation. 
According to our mathematicians 
they must be susceptible to mag- 
netic fields — so the cage that our 
people are designing should work. 
The creatures are also susceptible 
to beamed Carlotti transmissions, 
which could be used to prevent a 
caged entity from escaping by 
desynchronizing with normal 
space-time.” 

Grimes grunted affirmatively. 

“And as we have just seen — they 
can be killed. Killed by kindness.” 
Haab chuckled dryly. “Throw the 
energy of a nuclear blast on to their 
plates and they’re like a compulsive 
eater digging his grave with a knife 
and fork.” 

“Mphm.” 

“But I don’t want to kill them. I 
want to capture one, or more than 
one, to take back to Earth. I want 
to save a specimen of this unique 
life form, probably not a native of 
this galaxy, before the species is 
hunted to extinction.” 



142 



GALAXY 




“Then you had better get 
cracking,” Grimes told him without 
much sympathy. To him a menace 
to navigation was just that. “At last 
report there’s probably only one of 
the things left.” 

“Moebius Dick,” murmured 
Haab. 

T HEY watched the remainder 
of the films of Operation Rim- 
hunt, which could as well have been 
called Operation Search and 
Destroy. The use of fission 
weapons, stumbled upon by Cap- 
tain Laverton, remained effective, 
but it had to be improved upon. The 
energy eaters were intelligent— just 
how intelligent no one knew, 
probably no one ever would know. 
After the almost complete wiping 
out of that first cluster they tended 
to run from the Confederacy’s 
warships. Magnetic fields, set up by 
two or more vessels, were an in- 
visible net from which not all of the 
entities escaped — and those that did 
so made their getaway by desyn- 
chronization. Time-space twisting 
Carlotti beams were employed by 
the hunters and this technique 
seemed to inhibit temporal pre- 
cession. 

“Butchers,” muttered Haab at 
last. “Butchers.” 

“ Exterminators, ” corrected 
Grimes. “But both butchers and ex- 
terminators are essential to civiliza- 
tion. What about all the animals 
you have killed in your profession? 
Can you afford to talk?” 



“I can. Commodore. In the first 
place. I’ve gone after living speci- 
mens far more than I have dead 
ones. In the second place, the odds 
have never been stacked against the 
quarry in my hunts — as they have 
been in this operation of yours.” 
Grimes grunted. “I’m not a 
hunter. If I really wanted a dinner 
of grilled trout I’d be quite capable 
of tossing a hand grenade into the 
stream. If I have an infestation of 
rats or mice I go out and buy the 
most effective poison on the 
market.” 

“I seem to recall,” said Haab, 
“that you once used a fusion bomb 
to destroy a rat-infested ship.” 

“Yes. I did. It was necessary.” 
"Necessity,” murmured Haab, 
“what sins are committed in thy 
name? But let’s agree to shelve our 
differences. Do you think I could 
see the charts of sightings and — 
ah — victorious naval actions?” 
“Let’s have them, please, Miss 
Walton,” said Grimes. 

G RIMES later entertained Haab 
in his home. After the captain 
had returned to his ship Grimes’ 
wife, Sonya, said “So that’s the 
great hunter.” 

“I hope you were impressed,” 
said Grimes. 

“Impressed? Oh, I suppose I was 
in a way. But the man’s a mono- 
maniac. Hunting is his whole life.” 
“But you can say in his favor that 
he’s more concerned with capturing 
than killing.” 



THE LAST HUNT 



143 




“Is that so much better?” she de- 
manded. “Have you ever seen the 
Hummel Foundation’s zoo?” 

Grimes had seen it many years 
ago when he had been a very junior 
officer in the Survey Service. He 
had thought at the time that those 
animals from Earth-type planets 
had been comparatively lucky, they 
had been allowed a limited freedom 
in the open air. The beings from 
worlds utterly unlike Earth had 
been confined in transparent 
domes, inside which the conditions 
of their natural habitats had been 
faithfully reproduced in all respects 
but one — room to run, fly or 
slither. 

He said, “I think I know what 
you mean.” 

“I should hope you do,” she re- 
plied. “I’d sooner be dead than in a 
cage.” 

“Haah’s only doing his job.” 

“But he needn’t enjoy it so 
much.” 

“Are we so much better?” he 
queried. “Here are these creatures, 
drifting in from the Odd Gods of 
the Galaxy know where. They may 
be intelligent — but have we tried to 
find out? Oh, no — not us. All we 
did find out is how to destroy 
them.” 

“Don’t come over all virtuous, 
John. You were the first to start 
screaming about menaces to navi- 
gation on the Lorn-Llanith route. 
Now your precious lightjammers 
can come and go as they please. 
And that’s what you wanted.” 



T HE following morning he 
received a call from Admiral 
Kravitz. “I’m putting you back on 
the active list, Grimes.” 

“Again, sir? My paper work piled 
up when I made the voyage in 
Pamir and I’m still trying to shovel 
my way through the worst of the 
drifts.” 

“I want one of our people along 
in New Bedford as an observer. 
You are the obvious choice for the 
assignment.” 

“Why me?” 

“Why not you? You were keen 
enough to make a voyage in Pamir 
when it suited you. Now you can 
make a voyage in Haab’s ship when 
it suits me.” 

“Does Captain Haab know I’ll be 
along?” 

“He has been told that he will 
have to have a representative of our 
navy aboard when he lifts from 
Port Forlorn. He has only one 
spare cabin in his ship — a dogbox — 
so you’ll not be able to have Sonya 
along. Still, it should be an 
interesting trip.” 

“I hope so,” said Grimes. 

“With you among those present, 
it will be.” The admiral chuckled. 
“But I have to ring off. I’ll leave 
you to fix everything up with Haab. 
Let me know later what’s been ar- 
ranged. Over and out.” 

Grimes rose from his desk. “Miss 
Walton,” he said to his secretary, 
“I shall be aboard New Bedford if 
anybody wants me. Meanwhile, 
you can call Captain Macindoe at 



144 



GALAXY 




his home — he’s due back from 
leave, as you know — and ask him to 
come in to see me after lunch. He’ll 
be acting superintendent in my 
absence.” 

“Not B — Not Commander 
Williams again?” asked the girl 
disappointedly. 

“No. Billy Williams, as you al- 
most called him, is better at looking 
after his precious Rim Malemute 
than keeping my chair warm. What 
the pair of you were doing when I 
was away in Pamir and on Llanith 1 
hate to think.” 

He grinned, then made his way 
out of the office. 

He looked with fresh interest at 
New Bedford as he walked briskly 
across the apron. His earlier 
curiosity about her had been 
academic rather than otherwise, 
but now that he would be shipping 
out in her he was beginning to feel 
almost a proprietorial concern. 

He stared up at the dully 
gleaming tower that was her hull, at 
the sponsons and turrets that 
housed her weaponry, at the anten- 
nae indicative of sophisticated 
electronic equipment of a nature 
usually found only in warships and 
survey ships. But she was both, of 
course. Her normal employment 
could be classed as warfare of a sort 
and as survey work — also of a sort. 

Grimes marched up the ramp to 
the after airlock. His way into the 
compartment was barred by an of- 
ficer who asked curtly, “Your 
business, sir?” 



Grimes’ prominent ears started 
to redden. Surely everybody in Port 
Forlorn knew who he was. But this 
ship, of course, was not a regular 
visitor and her personnel were not 
Rimworlders. 

He said gruffly, “Commodore 
Grimes to see Captain Haab,” 

The young man went to a 
telephone. “Fourth mate here, Cap- 
tain. A Commodore Grimes to see 
you. Yes, sir. Right away.” Then 
to Grimes: “Follow me, sir.” 

The elevator carried them swiftly 
up the axial shaft. Haab’s quarters 
were just below and abaft the con- 
trol room. The master rose from his 
desk as Grimes was ushered into his 
day cabin. “Welcome aboard, 
Commodore. Thank you, Mr. 
Timon, you may carry on.” When 
the officer had left Haab asked, 
“And what can I do for you. Com- 
modore Grimes?” 

“I believe, Captain, that you’ve 
already heard from our admiralty.” 
“Indeed I have. They’re insisting 
that 1 canry some snot-nosed ensign 
or junior lieutenant with me as an 
observer — ” 

“Not an ensign or a lieutenant, 
Captain.” 

“Who, then?” 

Grimes grinned. “Me.” 

Haab did not grin in return. “But 
you’re not — ” 

“But 1 am. I’m a reserve officer 
back on the active list as and from 
this morning.” 

“Oh?” Haab managed a frosty 
smile. “I’m afraid I can’t offer you 



THE LAST HUNT 



145 




much in the way of accommo- 
dation, Commodore. This is a 
working ship. There’s a spare cabin 
the mate has been using as a 
storeroom — he’s getting it cleaned 
out now.” 

“As long as there’s a bunk — ” 
“There is — but not much else.” 
Haab’s grin was a little warmer. 
“But I am neglecting my duties as a 
host.” He walked to the little bar 
that stood against the bulkhead 
under the mounted head of some 
horrendously horned and tusked 
beast Grimes could not identify. 
“Perhaps you will join me in a sip 
of mayrenroth ?' 

“It will be my pleasure.” Haab 
filled small glasses with viscous, 
dark-brown fluid and Grimes ac- 
cepted his, raised it. “Your very 
good health, sir.” 

“And yours, Commodore.” 

The drink was potent, although 
Grimes did not much care for its 
flavor. He said, “This is an 
unusual — ah — spirit.” 

“Yes. I laid in a supply when I 
was on Pinkenbah. The natives 
ferment it from the blood of the 
mayren. a big, carnivorous lizard.” 
“Fascinating,” said Grimes, 
swallowing manfully. “I suppose 
your ship is well stocked with all 
manner of foods and drinks.” 

“She is,” Haab told him. 

Ill 

EW BEDFORD lifted from 
Port Forlorn on a cold, driz- 



zly morning, driving into and 
through the gray overcast. Grimes 
was a guest in her control room 
and, he was made to feel, a very 
unwelcome guest. Haab was coldly 
courteous, but his officers managed 
to convey the impression that they 
resented the presence of the out- 
sider and were demanding silently 
of each other. What is this old bas- 
tard doing here ? 

New Bedford went upstairs in a 
hurry. Word had come through to 
Port Forlorn that Rim Arquebus 
was not only tracking what was 
believed to be the last of the energy 
eaters but had already made two 
unsuccessful attempts to destroy 
the creature. Haab had protested 
and had been told this sector of 
space was under the jurisdiction of 
the Rim Worlds Confederacy and 
that he, his ship and his people were 
only there on sufferance. The at- 
titude adopted by his government 
did not make things any more 
pleasant for Grimes. 

Haab wasted little time setting 
trajectory once he was clear of 
Lorn’s Van Aliens. He lined his 
ship up on an invisible point in 
space some light-years in from the 
Llanith sun, then put his inertial 
drive on maximum acceleration, 
with his Mannschenn Drive 
developing a temporal precession 
rate that Grimes considered fool- 
hardy. Foolhardy or not, the dis- 
comfort was extreme — the crusing 
weight of three gravities ac- 
celeration combined with the eerie 




146 



GALAXY 




sensation of always being almost at 
the point of living backward. 

Apart from these discomforts she 
was not a happy ship. Her people, 
from the master down, were too 
dedicated. They lived hunting, 
talked hunting, thought hunting 
and, presumably, dreamed hunting. 
Grimes was allowed into a con- 
versation only when it was assumed 
that he would make some 
contribution to the success of the 
expedition — and this was not often. 

One night, at dinner, Haab did 
ask him for his views on the energy 
eaters. 

“How intelligent do you think 
they are, Commodore?” 

Grimes put down the fork with 
which he had been eating some 
vaguely fish-tasting mess, about 
which he had not dared to inquire. 
The implement clattered loudly on 
the surface of the plate — the high 
acceleration took some getting used 
to. He said, “You’ve seen all the 
reports, Captain Haab.” 

“Yes, Commodore Grimes. But 
you must have formed an opinion. 
After all, the energy eaters are in 
your back garden.” 

Grimes decided that he might as 
well talk as eat — he would not be 
missing much. “I don’t suppose I 
need to tell you about the Terran 
shark, Captain. He has, however, 
been described as a mobile appetite. 
He just eats and eats without dis- 
crimination, often to his own un- 
doing. He just hasn’t the sense to 
consider the consequences. Right?” 



Haab looked to Dr. Wayne, his 
biologist. Wayne grinned and said, 
“The Commodore hasn’t put it in 
very scientific language, but he’s 
not far off the beam.” 

“Then,” Grimes went on, “we 
have human beings who are com- 
pulsive eaters. They often are far 
from being unintelligent — yet they 
cannot control themselves, even 
though they know that they are dig- 
ging their graves with knives and 
forks. The energy eaters are more 
intelligent than sharks. They may 
be as intelligent as we are but we 
don’t know. Intelligent or not, they 
are handicapped.” 

“Handicapped? Just how?” de- 
manded Haab. 

“Unlike human compulsive 
eaters they have no control over 
their intake. If there is raw energy 
around they absorb it, whether they 
want to or not. They know, 1 think, 
that the absorption of the energy 
generated by a nuclear explosion 
will be fatal — but if they are in the 
vicinity of such a blast they cannot 
help themselves. Sorry — they can 
help themselves, but only by 
exercizing their power of temporal 
precession. And by the time they 
found this out they were almost 
extinct.” 

“Then Moebius Dick will give us 
a good fight," commented the 
mate. “He has survived in spite of 
everything that the navy has thrown 
at him.” 

“The commodore isn’t very 
interested in fighting fish,” said 



THE LAST HUNT 



147 




Haab. “He told me that he fishes 
for trout with hand grenades.” 

“I believe in getting results,” said 
Grimes, conscious that the officers 
and specialists around the table 
were looking at him coldly. 

EW BEDFORD sped through 
the warped continuum, 
homing on the continuous Carlotti 
signal that Grimes had persuaded 
the captain of Rim Arquebus to 
transmit. The warship was 

remaining in the vicinity of the last 
sighting of Moebius Dick and had 
received orders from the admiralty 
to cooperate with Haab. Coded 
signals had been made to Grimes 
and, reading them, he had gained 
the impression that Captain 

Welldean of the Arquebus was far 
from happy. But Grimes’ heart did 
not bleed for Welldean. Welldean 
was in his own ship with his own 
people as shipmates and his own 
cook turning out meals to his own 
taste. No doubt his feelings had 
been hurt when he had been ordered 
to abandon his own hunt and to put 
himself under the command of a 
reserve officer. But he was not an 
unwelcome guest aboard somebody 
else’s vessel. 

At last the tiny spark that was 
Rim Arquebus showed up just in- 
side the screen of the mass 
proximity indicator. Speed was 
reduced and eventually both drive 
units were shut down. Rim 
Arquebus hung there, five ki- 



lometers from New Bedford, a 
minor but bright constellation in 
the blackness. 

Welldean’s fat, surly face looked 
out from the screen of the NST 
transceiver at Grimes and the 
others in New Bedford’s control 
room. 

Have you any further in- 
formation, Captain?” asked Haab. 

Welldean replied in a flat voice, 
“The EE emerges into NST at 
regular half hourly intervals, 
remaining for ten minutes each 
time, presumably to feed on the 
radiation emitted by my ship. Pur- 
suant to instructions — ” he seemed 
to be glaring directly at Grimes — 
“I have made no hostile moves. 
Would the Commodore have any 
further orders for me?” 

“None at the moment. Captain,” 
Grimes told him. “Just stand by.” 
“Rim Arquebus standing by,” ac- 
knowledged Welldean sulkily. 

“When will Moebius Dick — ” 
Haab was interrupted by a shout 
from his mate. 

“There she blows!” 

The energy eater had appeared 
midway between the two ships. It 
was huge, brilliantly luminous, la- 
zily rotating. Grimes paraphrased 
wryly, He who eats and runs away 
will live to eat some other day . 
This thing had eaten and run away, 
eaten and run away and it had 
grown, was a vortex of forces all of 
a kilometer across. It would never 
fit into New Bedford’s capacious 
hold, a compartment designed for 




148 



GALAXY 




the carriage of alien life forms, 
some of them gigantic. But this did 
not matter. The cage of beams and 
fields would be set up outside the 
ship, but still within the temporal 
precession field of the Mannschenn 
Drive. 

Grimes, a mere observer aboard 
a vessel that was not his own, felt 
superfluous, useless, as Haab and 
his officers went into the drill that 
had been worked out to the last de- 
tail. The mate, Murgatroyd, would 
remain on board in charge of the 
ship — and Haab, with the second, 
third and fourth mates, would go 
out in the one-man chasers. Haab 
was already in his spacesuit — the 
small craft were no more than 
flying framework, unpressurized — 
and his prosthetic leg, through 
some freak of sound conductivity, 
clicked loudly as he moved. In his 
armor, with that mechanical noise 
accompanying every motion of his 
legs, he was more like a robot than 
a man, even though his chin beard 
was jutting through the open face- 
plate of his helmet. 

“Good hunting, Captain,” said 
Grimes. 

“Thank you, Commodore.” 
Haab turned to his mate. “You’re 
in charge of the ship, Mr. Murga- 
troyd. Don’t interfere with the 
hunt.” Then, to Grimes; “Will you 
tell Captain Welldean to keep his 
guns and torpedoes to himself?” 
Welldean’ s heavy face scowled at 
them from the screen of the NST 
transceiver. 



“Moebius Dick has gone,” an- 
nounced Murgatroyd. 

“When he surfaces again, we 
shall be in position,” Haab told him 
as he left the control room. 

Murgatroyd looked at Grimes. 
There’s nobody else to talk to, he 
seemed to be thinking, so / may as 
well pass the time of day with you. 
He said, “The Old Man always 
brings ’em back.” 

“Alive?” queried Grimes. 

“When he wants to,” replied the 
mate. 

Then he laughed. “He hasn’t 
much choice as far as that thing’s 
concerned. If it’s dead it’s — 
nothing.” Even in free fall he 
contrived to give the impression of 
being slumped in his seat. An in- 
congruous wistfulness softened the 
rough, scarred, big-featured face 
under the coarse, yellow hair. 

“You wish you were out in one of 
the chasers,” Grimes stated rather 
than asked. 

“I do. But somebody has to mind 
the shop — and it always seems to be 
me. There they go, Commodore.” 
Four bright sparks darted into 
the emptiness between New Bed- 
ford and Rim Arquebus. As they 
reached a predetermined position 
they slowed, stopped, then slid into 
a square formation. Moebius Dick 
should reappear at the center of the 
quadrangle and then, at Haab’s 
signal, each of the little crafts 
would become a fantastically 
powerful electromagnet and each 
would emit the beamed Carlotti 



THE LAST HUNT 



149 




transmissions, effectively netting 
the energy eater in time and space. 

Murgatroyd and Grimes stared 
into the screen of the mass 
proximity indicator. Four little 
points of light marked the positions 
of the chasers, a much fainter one 
denoting the presence of the energy 
eater. 

“Master to New Bedford 
crackled from the speaker. “Check 
position, please.” 

" New Bedford to master,” re- 
plied Murgatroyd. “You are 
exactly in position. Over.” 

“Rim Arquebus to Commodore 
Grimes,” put in Welldean. “Do you 
wish me to take any action when 
the EE surfaces?” 

“Haab to Grimes. You are only 
an observer. And that goes for your 
navy, too. Over.” 

“The old man gets tensed up,” re- 
marked Murgatroyd, with the 
faintest hint of apology in his 
voice.” 

" Rim Arquebus to Commodore 
Grimes. My weaponry is manned 
and ready,” persisted Welldean. 

“So is mine.” Murgatroyd 
chuckled, waving a big hand over 
his fire-control console. 

The minutes, the seconds, ticked 
by. Grimes watched the sweep 
second hand of the clock. He had 
noted the time of Moebius Dick’s 
disappearance. The half-hour was 
almost up. When that red pointer 
came around to 37. 

“Now!” yelled the Mate. 

Moebius Dick was back. The 



enormous circle of gyrating 
luminescence had reappeared in the 
center of the square formed by the 
chasers. From the NST speaker 
came the low-pitched buzz and 
crackle of interference as the so- 
lenoids were energized. The energy 
eater hung there, quivering, 
seeming to shrink within itself. 
Then it moved, tilting like a pro- 
cessing gyroscope. 

Haab’s voice could be heard 
giving orders: “Increase to six 
hundred thousand gausses. To six- 
fifty — seven hundred — ”. 

From one of the chasers came a 
bright, brief flare and from the 
speaker a cry of alarm: “Captain, 
my coil has blown!” 

“Master to second and fourth 
mates — triangular formation.” 

Moebius Dick was spinning 
about a diametric axis, no longer a 
circle of light but a hazy sphere of 
radiance. The energy eater was 
rolling through the emptiness, 
directly toward one of the throe 
still-functioning chasers. The small 
craft turned to run. Rim Arquebus 
stabbed out with a barrage of laser 
beams. In New Bedford's control 
room Murgatroyd swore, added his 
fire to that from the frigate. It was 
ineffective — or highly effective in 
the wrong way. The monster 
glowed ever more brightly as it 
absorbed the energy directed at it, 
moved ever faster. The chaser 
turned and twisted desperately, 
hopelessly. The other chasers could 
not pursue for fear of running into 



150 



GALAXY 




the fire from the ships. There was 
nothing that they could have done, 
in any case. 

“The old man’s boat — ” mut- 
tered Murgatroyd. “I guess it’s the 
way he wanted to go — ” His hand 
fell away from the firing stud. 
Moebius Dick was rolling over 
Haab’s small and fragile craft. 

Grimes, on the NST VHF, was 
ordering, “Hold your fire, Rim 
Arquebus! Hold your fire!” 

Welldean’s voice came back: 
“What the hell do you think I’m 
doing?” Adding, as a grudging 
afterthought: “Sir.” 

The lights of the chaser flared 
briefly through the luminous, 
swirling haze that enveloped them, 
flared and died. But something, 
somebody, broke through the living 
radiance. It was the spacesuited 
Haab, using his personal propul- 
sion unit to drive him back to his 
ship. 

He broke through and broke 
away and for a second or so it 
seemed that he would succeed. 
Then Moebius Dick was after him, 
overtaking him, enveloping him. 
From the NST speaker came a 
short, dreadful scream. The globe 
of flame that was the energy eater 
seemed to swell, was swelling, 
visibly and rapidly, assuming the 
appearance of a gigantic, spherical 
fire opal. The three surviving 
chasers retreated rapidly. 

Dark streaks suddenly marred 
the iridescent beauty of the sphere, 
spread, rapidly covering the entire 



surface. Where Moebius Dick had 
been there was only nothingness. 

No, not nothingness. 

Floating in the darkness, 
illumined by the searchlights of the 
three small craft, was the lifeless, 
armored figure of Captain Haab. 

“They’ll bring him in,” muttered 
Murgatroyd. “I’ll take him back to 
Earth for burial. Those were his 
wishes.” 

"Rim Arquebus to New Bed- 
ford," came Welldean’s voice. “Do 
you require medical assistance? 
Shall I send a boat with my 
surgeon — ” 

“We’ve a quack of our own,” 
snarled Murgatroyd, “and a good 
one. But even he won’t be able to do 
anything. The old man is dead.”

THE LAST HUNT 



151 





«TT WAS his leg that saved 
A him,” said Grimes to Sonya 
when, back at Port Forlorn, he was 
telling her the story of the hunt. 
“How do you make that out?” 
“Well, perhaps it wasn’t his leg, 
but all of us came to the conclusion 
that it was, as it were, the last straw 
that broke the camel’s back.” 
“Make your mind up, John. I’d 
gotten used to the idea that 
Moebius Dick was a sort of latter- 
day white whale — and now you 
refer to him as a camel!” 

“You know what I mean — I’m 
talking about the item that finally 
made him lose control. Moebius 
Dick had been feeding well over a 
period of quite some weeks. Every 
time Rim Arquebus heaved a tor- 
pedo at him he’d skim the cream off 
the fireball and then vanish, being 
too intelligent to overeat. But all 
life forms tend to act unintelligently 
when infuriated and he was no ex- 
ception. When he broke out of 
Haab’s electromagnetic net he was 
no more than a dangerous, vicious 
animal. He was being pumped full 
of photons by the concentrated 
laser fire from the two ships — and it 
meant as little to him as a stream of 
bullets means to a charging carni- 
vore. He ‘killed’ Haab’s chaser, 
gulping all the energy from its ma- 
chinery. He would have killed Haab 
himself — Haab was in a state of 
complete paralysis when he was 
brought on board — if he hadn’t 
started his meal on the Captain’s 
leg. 



“You know that the Tan- 
ganoran’s are famous for their 
powered prosthetic limbs, don’t 
you? Haab’s right leg was a beau- 
tiful machine with its own, built-in 
power plant — cells with a working 
life of a least twenty standard years 
after installation, a slow, rigidly 
controlled fission process. Moebius 
Dick got that twenty years’ worth 
of energy in one bite.” 

“Critical mass or critical 
charge — or whatever?” murmured 
Sonya. “But Haab’s anagramatic 
namesake wasn’t as lucky with his 
peg leg.” 

“What the hell are you talking 
about?” 

“Or was he more than just a 
namesake?” 

“I still don’t get you.” 

“You must remember that talk 
we had with the Reverend Madam 
Swithin about reincarnation. How 
she told us that — according to the 
tenets of her Church — some souls 
have to wait around for centuries 
until the shuffling of chromosomes 
and genes produces just the right 
body, with just the right brain and 
psychological make-up, for their 
next embodiment. “It makes an 
odd sort of sense, doesn’t it? Cap- 
tain Ahab, the whaler — Captain 
Haab, the hunter — ” 

“But Ahab was only a fictional 
character!” Grimes, protested to 
his wife. 

“Aren’t we all finally?” she asked 
reasonably. “Those of us who de- 
serve being made into legends?” *

* < \Y/ ONDER of wonder of 
W wonders,” said the chair- 
lady, after my speech at a Book 
Fair in Cape Cod a dozen or so 
years ago. “Here’s an author who 
speaks for an hour about a new 
young writer, and never once men- 
tions the title of his own new 
book!” She was describing my 
response to the first Brian Aldiss 
story that reached its fist up from 
the printed page to punch me in the 
mouth. Another recollection. At 
one of the earliest Milford 
Conferences, Damon Knight and 
Jim Blish came up with the 
interesting notion that a writer has 
a thing he says and he tends to say 
it over and over again — not by any 
means repetitiously, but the- 
matically or in his selection of 
image and relevant metaphor. 
What Brian Aldiss says over and 
over is, “1 am concerned about 
what’s happening to us,” and 
“what’s happening” and “us” are 



projected in the widest and deepest 
possible ways. There are plenty of 
writers, especially in sf, who are 
aware and alert and who try their 
best to be relevant, but I know of no 
other, with the possible exception of 
Frank Herbert, who warns us so 
consistently that we are, as a 
species, horror-bound. He warns us 
because he loves us, really thinks 
we have something worth saving. 
This emerges from Brian’s come- 
dies (he can be very funny) and his 
tragedies and in his short tense sus- 
pense pieces. His new retrospective 
from DAW, The Book of Brian 
Aldiss , composed of stories which 
first appeared in British and U.S. 
magazines from 1957 until this 
year, bears out this notion, and the 
long-awaited paperback ap- 
pearance of his novel Barefoot in 
the Head brings it to a high peak. 
Barefoot is truly an experience and, 
you must be warned, it isn’t an easy 
one. He begins singing his melody 



153 



in single notes and is soon singing 
harmony with himself, like Joni 
Mitchell recording a second voice 
track. At length he begins to play in 
chords, using a whole boxful of 
tricks and devices— puns, double- 
entendres, metaphors, neologisms. 
Ultimately he arrives at verse — be- 
cause, one feels, he has used up 
everything else. 

Barefoot in the Head therefore is 
without question, an assault, and it 
follows that comparison with 
James Joyce is inevitable (Joyce 
used to write on huge cardboard 
sheets with many colors of crayon, 
doing the same phrase in three or 
four or even five ways as a first 
draft, and then fusing them into the 
final one) and whether Aldiss has 
done less than Joyce — or something 
different from Joyce — is for the 
assessment of a far more profound 
Joycian than the undersigned. Do 
not take this book lightly — and do 
not forget it. 



ANOTHER writer who is not to 
be taken lightly is Frank 
Herbert, whose The God Makers is 
quite another kind of experience. 
Herbert writes fables of a high 
order. By fables 1 mean narratives 
in which the basic statement — 
“moral”, if you like — transcends 
the story line and is useful 
elsewhere. There is, 1 think, a rising 



tide of profound religious and 
philosophical thinking in the specu- 
lative field just now and in these 
complex and puzzling and im- 
mensely fruitful areas Frank 
Herbert seems quite at home. Long 
before Dune he had shown his 
ability to establish a scene — plant, 
culture, star-system, what-have- 
you — by a strict set of rules and 
adhere to it. And so he does in this 
new novel despite its meld of space 
and psi, of science and miracle. The 
story of Lewis Orne and his quest 
for the nature of godhood produces 
many a parallel, many an analogy, 
many a flash of recognition of 
things the reader knows, or almost 
knows, about the nature of his own 
devils and, possibly, his own 
powers. Unlike the Aldiss, this 
book can be read, if you like, purely 
for the excitement of its narrative 
line, the way an eight-year-old can 
read Gulliver. But if you want 
layers and levels this is one of those 
books that will give you back 
whatever you’re capable of carrying 
to it. 

S OME sf addicts profess, in fury 
or disgust or even in terror, that 
the beloved field is being diluted by 
the mainstream, and that gone 
forever are the days of hard science 
and high adventure. Fear not. Not 
while Ben Bova is around and doing 
such things as his As On a Darkling 



154 



GALAXY 




Plain. Taking off from the reliable 
old idea of truly alien artifacts 
found on a body — in this case, 
Titan — Bova gives us a neatly inter- 
woven tale of a man’s obsessive bat- 
tle to unearth their secrets and of 
the personal, physical — and par- 
ticularly the bureaucratic obstacles 
in his way. From the “biological 
blizzard” which is Jupiter to the 
subsidiary adventures of the explo- 
ration missions and finally to the 
advanced hard science of the “ma- 
chines on Titan” I liked it — I 
believed it. 

O NE thing I like and believe 
only the hard way, uphill and 
very seldom, is sword-and-sorcery. 
Many a murrain has been called 
down upon me for this and I’m 
sorry, but I can’t lie to you about it. 
What entranced me early about it 
was the magic of Arthur 
(Ourouboros) Eddison and C.L. 
Moore — to say nothing of my 
childhood infatuation with Bur- 
roughs’ John Carter, and of course 
Tolkien. I find, however, that the 
vast bulk of s&s has the same 
defect, the same permanent pro- 
hibition from becoming great and 
lasting literature, that TV series 
have. The genre’s very nature 
dictates that the sword-swinging 
protagonist must be the same 
person at the end of the story as he 
is at the beginning. No matter how 



well written or superbly cast, no 
matter how horrific the monsters 
and the hordes or how far-out the 
magic land, evanescence and 
triviality do prevail — and true sus- 
pense is impossible for me if the 
central character cannot develop, 
age, fail, die, or (as is too often the 
case) even learn. Some writers 
know how to avoid this — le Guin 
for one — and now and again there 
arrives a book so colorful, whose 
language is so cadenced and precise 
and whose characters (for all their 
basic changelessness) are so dimen- 
sional that you have to love them 
anyhow. Such a novel is Zelazny’s 
The Guns of Avalon — mostly be- 
cause such is Zelazny, whose very 
laundry lists, 1 swear, could be set 
to music like a lyric. Avalon is 
another in the series about the nine 
princes in Amber and will voyage 
you well. 

E VER since, at the behest of the 
late great John Campbell, 
writers began wrestling with the 
logic of magic, the notion has af- 
fixed itself to sf as well as fantasy. 
Witchcraft has its own rigid and 
rigorous disciplines and time and 
again has been the storage 
warehouse for ideas, substances, 
chemicals and processes used ulti- 
mately by formal science. With the 
new and deeper preoccupation with 
“inner space” witchy ideas chime 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



155 




more and more harmoniously with 
“psi” concepts and present in- 
triguing alternatives to established 
physical laws and principles. That’s 
fair enough, too — the idea of close- 
up photographs of Mars would 
have been called witchcraft not long 
ago, so why not grab the other end 
of the broom and have witchcraft 
circumvent the light barrier? 
Gordon Dickson’s The Pritcher 
Mass gives us a most intriguing 
witch and some interesting insights 
into the craft, embodied in a 
genuinely original tale of a psychic 
or paranormal “mass” in construc- 
tion out beyond Pluto, which will be 
used to scan deep space for planets 
desperately needed by the sealed-in 
population of a poisoned Earth. 
Dickson, like Aldiss, exhibits a 
concern for the environment and 
sounds a grim warning; this time 
it’s in the area of pollution-induced 
plant mutation, which has a 
frightening logic to it. A good 
book. 

AMON KNIGHT is two 
kinds of editor, both good. 
His “theme” anthologies are in- 
variably well-conceived and well- 
balanced and his originals — the Or- 
bits — remain one of the most 
potent proving grounds for new 
writers and for new concepts and 
approaches for established ones. 
Perchance to Dream is a good 



example of the first. The stories are 
about dreams and surely you’ll 
have read some of them before. 
But — do you have a‘ copy of Am- 
brose Bierce’s Incident at Owl 
Creek Bridge around the house? 
Aiken’s Mr. Arcularisl Here are 
dream stories by Maugham, 
Dostoevsky, Collier, Borges and 
others, treasures all. Funny dreams, 
frightening dreams, puzzling and 
thought-provoking and awesome 
dreams. Not a dud in the lot — a 
real jewelbox of a book. 

Orbit 11 is up to Knight’s high 
standards. Some very well prac- 
ticed hands are here — Gene Wolfe, 
Fred Pohl, Edward Wellen, Charles 
Platt. Some new lights, already 
bright: Effinger, Thurston, Dozois. 
And some new discoveries. Knight 
is one editor who can surf on the 
“new wave” without losing sight of 
the beach. 

ASIDE from Farmer’s Lord 
X*. Tyger, which is totally unique, 
the most unusual book of the year 
is Norman Spinrad’s The Iron 
Dream. It was written in six weeks 
by a commercial pulp writer. It is 
basically a hack sword-and-sorcery 
job, whose occasional passages of 
raw power are probably due more 
to the author’s psychopathology 
than to consciously controlled 
literary craftsmanship. So, at least, 
claims the critic Homer Whipple in

a penetrating criticism appended to 
the book. The novel was written by 
one Adolf Hitler. A short biog- 
raphy precedes the original title 
page, which is not The Iron Dream 
at all, but Lord of the Swastika. It 
is absolutely apalling. It contains 
enough gore to close every blood- 
bank in the country for a year. It’s 
a terrible book. And brilliant, a 
Class Plus A-One tour de force by 
Norman Spinrad. A high-priority 
must.

I 

T 1 HE three-year quarantine was 
practically over. His eager 
imagination conjuring blue skies, 
green fields, laughing children and 
the other ingredients of a life 
literally of another world, George 
Hender stood beside his bed in his 
quarters below the Luna crater 
Eratosthenes and began to pack his 
few personal belongings. Human- 
like he did not think of the ugliness 
of poverty and pollution, of the fact 
men still slew each other on that 
cloud-dappled planet high in the 
Luna sky. 

He first packed all the vials 
containing the samples he had been 
allowed to retain for his own use. 
Three were carefully banded 
together — one vial containing the 
corpse of an insectlike creature 
with ten legs, the second a bright 
purple ball of fluff, the third a tiny 
plant with grayish leaves and a 
fleshy stalk. Not much to the unin- 
formed eye perhaps, but Hender 
knew these were three stages in the 
development of the same life form. 
Next came the water sample he had 
collected in the mist below the 
Great Cliff. Again not much to 
look at. But it was a reminder of the 
glittering cascade that poured 
uninterrupted for three thousand 
meters down the side of that fan- 
tastic geological fault. Then there 
were microscope slides of various 
organisms — plant, animal and a 
few in between. A slender piece of 



vine with a tensile strength ap- 
proaching that of steel. A chunk of 
wood that, when heated to one 
hundred and eighty degrees, could 
be molded like soft putty. 

The samples were followed by his 
two miniature cameras. Spools of 
film totaling he did not know how 
many exposures. Not as extensive, 
of course, as the official records of 
the expedition. But a man needed to 
do work of his own on a mission of 
such long duration. Schekart, for 
instance, had taken to painting. 
And Hender had little doubt those 
gloomy landscapes would hang in 
many of Earth’s major galleries. 

His instrument and sample belt. 
He coiled it carefully despite the 
fact it was scarred and frayed as if 
it had been forcibly dragged 
through tightly wound barbed wire. 
That had happened when his lift- 
pack failed over one of the thorn 
forests — his body still bore the 
marks inflicted by those vicious six- 
inch barbs. But the belt had 
continued its usefulness on every 
field trip he made on Alpha Five, a 
proud record considering it had 
outlasted several sets of armorcloth 
coveralls. 

Hender considered the belt care- 
fully. Then he uncoiled it, held it 
upside down ami shook it. Particles 
of dirt, some dust, and finally a few 
shreds of vegetable matter fell out. 
Nothing of interest, except. 

H E PICKED up the brittle 
sliver of faded green and held 



159 




it up to the light. It was just a blade 
of grass. But it was a blade of grass 
from a lawn most of the expedition 
members had said could not be 
grown. Young Brian McEvoy, 
however, was merely an electronics 
specialist. He knew nothing about 
botany, ecology, or indeed any of 
the life sciences. He only knew he 
had not brought five pounds of 
grass seed all the way from Earth 
for nothing. So he had consulted 
the ship’s library, prepared the 
proper chemical nutrients, even im- 
provised a sprinkler and pump to 
water his few square meters from a 
nearby stream. He had fussed, wor- 
ried, made a thorough fool of 
himself — and after a few months 
created the lushest lawn on the 
planet. Actually the only lawn, 
Hender thought with a reminiscent 
smile. But it was fortunate its sur- 
vival had depended upon such 
loving care. Otherwise the next 
expedition to Alpha Five would 
find its ecology drowned under an 
ocean of waving green. 

More oddments went into the 
bag. A few items of clothing, a 
small abstract carved by John Ling 
just before the geologist lost the use 
of his right arm in a rock fall. And 
finally the few letters Hender had 
received only hours before Golden 
Hind moved out of Earth orbit and 
began its voyage to the Centauri 
system. He looked them over one 
by one. A polite farewell from 
Ronald, typed on office stationery. 
They had not seen each other for 



years anyway, so Ron could hardly 
be expected to gush over a brother 
he hardly knew. A couple from 
friends in the Astronaut Corps. He 
had largely lost contact with them, 
too, especially after he transferred 
to the Interstellar Project. And here 
was Anne’s last letter. More per- 
sonal of course, expressing senti- 
ments deep and genuine. Would he 
have married her if he had not been 
on the Project? Probably. She had 
been a wonderful girl — he would 
have been a fool not to. But then 
again he had only met her because 
she happened to be one of the 
Project’s technicians, so the 
question was hypothetical in any 
case. One of life’s little ironies, he 
supposed. 

The last letter was on cheap note- 
paper, so he handled it very care- 
fully. But the dearly loved childish 
scrawl was still legible and he read 
it again, his memories of her little 
face as clear as they had been — how 
many hundred readings ago? 

Darling daddy, she had written. 
Please do not go away too long. 
Auntie Sue has told me you are 
going to a star, not like mommy but 
in a spaceship. She also said we 
cannot see the star from America, 
so I hope she and Uncle Jack will 
take me where / can see it some 
time. Come back soon and please 
bring me a star teddy . Love Wendy. 

Hender wished he knew what a 
star teddy was, but it had been too 
late to find out. Instead he hoped 
the painstaking model he had 



160 



GALAXY 




created from local materials and 
imagination would be an acceptable 
substitute. She was older now, but 
surely she would remember and 
understand. 

Damn the blasted quarantine! 

It was not so much the three 
years’ confinement in this secret 
base that bothered him — at least 
not as much as the fact no outside 
contact had been permitted either 
way. People on Earth had not even 
been told Golden Hind was back — 
indeed, most of them thought the 
expedition had perished long ago on 
the fifth planet of Alpha Centauri! 

Of course the reasons for the se- 
crecy were logical enough. Doctor 
Fielden had expressed them very 
clearly just after the six returnees 
arrived in Eratosthenes. 

“Medical science has advanced a 
great deal in the last few years,” he 
told them. “To the extent, in fact, 
that no known disease is now be- 
yond cure. Unfortunately popular 
opinion has misinterpreted this into 
the dangerous notion that no 
disease is beyond cure.” 

He had smiled wearily. 

“Gentlemen, you know we risk 
the future of four billion human 
beings if we let you return home be- 
fore we are sure you carry no in- 
fection of an alien nature. Some of 
my colleagues are so concerned 
with this problem that they have at- 
tempted — unsuccessfully 1 might 
add — to have the quarantine 
extended to five years. And you 
know what that might do to your 



health! Suffice to say it was 
eventually decided to keep your 
return secret until the previously 
agreed upon three years are over. 
That way there can be no pressure 
to force us to reduce this already 
minimum margin of safety. 

“It was also agreed that during 
your stay here in Eratosthenes you 
will receive no news of a personal 
nature. Your quarantine will be dif- 
ficult enough without your being 
faced with problems about which 
you can do nothing without 
breaking security.” 

The news had been unpleasant to 
say the least and the starmen had 
wasted no time voicing their objec- 
tions. They were listened to, of 
course. Even the sophisticated spe- 
cialists who shared their exile 
looked on the men who had been to 
Alpha Five with definite respect if 
not outright awe. But these deci- 
sions had been made long before 
the starship arrived off Titan 
Station — and were irrevocable. The 
six astronauts had had to be content 
with the luxuries provided for them, 
with the censored telecasts beamed 
directly from Earth and with the 
companionship of their fellow 
exiles. It was, incidentally, no acci- 
dent that nineteen of the thirty- 
eight people who lived at the base 
were women. Eight couples were al- 
ready married when the thirty-two 
specialists came to Eratosthenes 
and by the end of the first year four 
more couples signed contracts. The 
astronauts, however, had kept their 



SIX MEN FROM ALPHA 



161 




single status, though only one — the 
monkish Howard Schekart — chose 
not to form an “attachment.” 

H ENDER closed the bag care- 
fully and pressed one of his 
identification labels to its side. He 
wondered if he would see much of 
Marguerite after they landed on 
Earth — if he had made a mistake 
when he told her he would enter no 
permanent union until he became 
fully adjusted to the new life. He 
was certain her feelings toward him 
were far stronger than she had 
admitted, but he also knew her 
pride would never let her accept the 
implication: You'll do if no one else 
turns up . 

The P. A. cleared its throat and 
announced: “The final briefing will 
be held in the Common Room in 
fifteen minutes. Unless you are on 
essential duty, please attend.” 
“Oh?” Hender asked the air. He 
put the bag on the floor beside his 
bed, then went into the corridor and 
tapped on the door across from his. 

“George,” he said. “Can I come 
in?” 

“It’s open,” she called. 

He went in. She also was 
packing, but she looked up with an 
immediate smile. 

“One to go,” she said, referring 
to their own private countdown. 
“Nervous?” 

He grimaced. “Frankly, I’m 
scared to death.” He went over and 
kissed the nape of her neck. “You’ll 
keep holding my hand, I hope?” 



His voice was jocular, but 
Marguerite’s discerning ear sensed 
it was only a veneer. He’s uptight, 
she thought. Terribly so. And then, 
rationalizing: But so are we all. 

For the thousandth time she 
wished she were not so emotionally 
involved with this man and again 
firmed her resolve to leave him as 
soon as the worst was over. But 
Marguerite Walsh was too good a 
psychologist to upset the delicate 
edge he was treading and too good 
a woman to want to. 

So she smiled again, touched his 
face and said gently, “I’ll be with 
you every step, dear.” 

She put a filmy thing into the 
case and snapped it shut. Guess / 
won't see that again, Hender 
thought wistfully, but immediately 
submerged the unbidden eroticism 
by asking, “What do you think 
Fielden is up to? I understood no 
more briefings would be 
necessary.” 

“So did I.” She frowned. “Of 
course, he could have been hooked 
by our father image of him.” 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“If you were the head of a large 
family that was about to split up, 
wouldn’t you at least want to wish 
them well?” 

He looked slightly startled. 
“Well, put that way — ” Abruptly 
Hender’s rather homely features 
creased into a broad grin. “So you 
figure we’re in for a little paternal 
advice, huh?” 

“That’s my guess. We have all 



162 



GALAXY 




been away from home a long time, 
so it could be he wants to make sure 
he’s not about to unload a bunch of 
anachronistic misfits. Anyway, let’s 
go see, shall we?” 

II 

T HE Eratosthenes base was a 
sprawling complex of chambers 
originally constructed to house the 
deep-space research unit of the 
International Science Academy. 
Economics had subsequently 
dictated its passing to the control of 
the Space Agency and minimal 
maintenance during long periods of 
idleness. When the first signals 
were detected from the returning 
starship, it was only necessary to 
make minor adjustments within its 
regular hudget for the Agency to 
ready the base for immediate 
habitation. And then economies 
were continued. Maintainance of 
the base and its life-support systems 
became the responsibility of 
everyone — including crews under 
quarantine — especially the hydro- 
ponic gardens from which came the 
dual necessities of food and oxygen. 
The base was hardly the most de- 
sirable substitute for home for 
Earth-starved astronauts. 

But all of this was behind them 
now — or nearly so — and as Hender 
and the brunette psychologist 
joined the others in the Common 
Room they found a puzzled air of 
expectancy, which more or less 
matched their own. 



Marguerite clutched Hender’s 
arm. “Isn’t it strange?” she whis- 
pered. “Suddenly I don’t feel like a 
person about to go home. More like 
someone about to leave it.” 

He looked down at her, his face 
intent. “Yes,” he said. And meant 
it. 

They sat together on a couch at 
the back of the room as a small 
man with lined features and unruly 
white hair faced the crowd and 
muttered a quick count of those 
present. Finally he nodded and 
waved for silence. 

“With the exception of Mort and 
Peter who are on duty in Control,” 
Dr. Marcus Fieldon announced, “I 
think we are all here.” 

“But not for long,” retorted a 
voice from the audience. 

The white head nodded. “No, 
Weldon, not for long. Which is one 
of the reasons for this final 
gathering. I must be sure we are all 
ready for our — ah — rebirth into the 
complexities of human society.” 
“Oh, come off it, Marcus.” 
Weldon Gill, the commander of the 
Alpha Five expedition, squinted at 
the scientist from eyes injured when 
a lovely blue-gold flower had re- 
plied to his charmed curiosity with 
a squirt of acid. Though not com- 
pletely blind — he had, for instance, 
functioned reasonably well during 
the remaining six weeks on the 
planet — Gill nevertheless chafed 
under his affliction with an almost 
bursting impatience. And because 
he knew a complete cure was 



SIX MEN FROM ALPHA 



163 




available in any one of Earth’s bet- 
ter hospitals his belligerence was 
understandable when he demanded, 
“You’re not thinking of delaying 
our return, are you?” He glared 
pugnaciously. “Because if you are, 
forget it!” 

“Actually I am considering no 
such thing,” Fielden said mildly. “1 
am merely wondering whether or 
not we should continue the indoctri- 
nation sessions after we return 
home. Now will you please permit 
me to continue?” 

The scientist looked around at his 
audience. They appeared a normal 
collection of people, male and fe- 
male, young and middle-aged. They 
were also a highly intelligent group, 
which in a sense was his main 
problem. Intelligence went with 
sensitivity and because of that he 
knew many adjustments would be 
difficult. So he chose his words with 
care. 

“I need hardly remind you that 
human beings suffer psychological 
deterioration if they remain away 
from their home planet for any pe- 
riod longer than three years. 
Though the reasons for this are not 
yet entirely clear, it is thought some 
kind of subtle relationship exists 
between man’s physical envi- 
ronment and his mind — a link, if 
you will, which permits norma! 
thought processes only when his 
senses indicate that gravity, air, 
light, etcetera are all Earth normal. 
We are fortunate, of course — those 
first three years can be tolerated 



with no noticeable ill effect. But 
after that the symptoms appear 
quite rapidly. Irritability, tiredness, 
inability to concentrate and so on — 
you know what they are. 

“Questions. How long can a 
person remain away from Earth 
without suffering a complete break- 
down? Does the deterioration 
process continue to an inevitable 
end or does it stop after a time, 
leaving the individual psychologi- 
cally depleted but still functional? 
Or is there a reversal, an eventual 
return to normalcy? I am sure you 
understand the importance of 
these — especially with respect to 
future interstellar colonization.” 

Well here we are, Hender 
thought. Gill, Ling, McEvoy, 
Roberts, Schekart and Hender. Six 
answers giving you the stars on a 
plate. And you have known it for 
three years, so why bring it up now ? 
He listened with increasing irri- 
tation as Fielden continued. 

“Three other expeditions have 
since been sent to other star sys- 
tems. Enterprise to Barnard’s Star, 
Columbus to Lalande 21185 and 
Deep Traveler farthest of all — to 
Epsilon Eridani. We do not know 
what their crews may or may not 
find — or even that they will ever 
return. But the success of Golden 
Hind does at least hold out a slight 
hope that man has a future among 
the stars.” 

“Only a slight hope?” queried 
someone. “Why the doubts. 
Doctor?” 



164 



GALAXY 




Fielden peered toward the ques- 
tioner and recognized Len Roberts, 
Alpha Five’s geographer. “Why? 
Well let me ask you a question, Mr. 
Roberts. Why haven’t you and your 
five colleagues suffered the same 
deterioration I was discussing a few 
moments ago? After all, you have 
been away from Earth for 
considerably more than your allot- 
ted three years.” 

Roberts, a large man with a luxu- 
rious black beard, stared back in- 
credulously. “Are you pulling my 
leg? You know better than any of 
us — the time in hypothermia 
doesn’t count. And neither do the 
two years we spent on Alpha Five. 
Our longest period of activity has 
been this last three years in 
Eratosthenes. So unless everything 
I have been told is crazy, that puts 
the six of us in exactly the same 
boat as the rest of you.” 

“Based on the assumption that 
hypothermia somehow restores the 
psychological balance? That those 
periods of activity between periods 
in hypothermia are not cumulative? 
Is that the basis of your reasoning, 
Mr. Roberts?” 

“Not my reasoning damn it.” the 
geographer shot back testily. “It 
was the reasoning of the people who 
organized our expedition — and you 
know that, too. They would hardly 
have sent us to the Centauri system 
if there was a chance we would wind 
up as raving lunatics.” 

“Of course not.” Fielden paused 
a moment, then went on quietly: 



“Unfortunately, we now know their 
reasoning was in error.” 

H ENDER jerked upright in his 
seat. What in blazes is he 
talking about? He looked at the girl 
at his side and saw that she was 
equally surprised. And so, ap- 
parantly, was everyone else in the 
room. Or so it seemed from the 
barrage of excited questions 
coming from all sides. 

Marcus Fielden waved his hands 
for silence, 

“I am going to show you the 
results of an experiment actually 
concluded some years ago. 
However, it was done in such se- 
crecy that even 1 and my colleagues 
were not told of it — you will under- 
stand why when you see this tape. 
Anyway, it seems someone in the 
Agency’s bureaucracy finally had 
the good sense to realize that we in 
Eratosthenes should have this 
knowledge. In his enlightenment he 
had it transmitted here” Fielden 
smiled sadly — “yesterday.” 

The obvious sarcasm was greeted 
with nervous laughter which 
reflected his audience's confusion 
and puzzled curiosity. 

Hender knew he echoed 
everyone’s feelings as he muttered, 
“1 wish he’d shut up and get on with 
it.” 

Marguerite laid a hand on his 
arm. “Hush.” 

The lights dimmed and the Com- 
mon Room’s screen illuminated to 
show a large spacecraft settling 



SIX MEN FROM ALPHA 



165 




down toward the surface of the 
moon. As dust flared out beneath 
the ship’s braking jets, a service 
crawler trundled into view, its 
boarding tube already extended. 
Two space-suited figures rode in the 
tube’s open end, a dangerous proce- 
dure that clearly indicated 
someone’s urgency to get on board. 

As his audience watched the un- 
gainly surface vehicle approach its 
target Fielden said, “A com- 
mentary comes with this tape, but 
to save time I will give an abbre- 
viated version. First let me remind 
you that the so-called ‘remission’ 
aspect of hypothermia was assumed 
on the basis of the work of several 
research people who independently 
corroborated each other’s findings. 
Hypothermia, of course, had al- 
ready made it possible for man to 
survive an interstellar journey, 
though there was little point to such 
an endeavor as long as the sub- 
sequent three-year quarantine left 
little or no time for planetary explo- 
ration. But now we knew — or 
thought we knew — that periods of 
activity between periods in 
hypothermia were not cumulative 
and it seemed we could dust off our 
interstellar plans and go ahead with 
the first flight. And so the Alpha 
Centauri mission was conceived 
and launched. And later, at regular 
intervals, we launched three other 
flights to more distant star systems. 

“But after Deep Traveler had de- 
parted for Epsilon Eridani someone 
came to the belated realization that 



the remission aspect of hypoth- 
ermia had never been proven by 
actual test. So plans for further 
missions were immediately can- 
celed pending production of such 
proof. Which, ladies and 
gentlemen, is what this tape is all 
about.” 

The scene on the screen cut to 
within the crawler’s boarding tube. 
The tube had been mated to the 
collar around the ship’s airlock and 
the two men in space suits were 
opening the lock preparatory to en- 
tering the ship. 

As the camera followed their 
activities, Dr. Fielden continued: 
“After working a standard three- 
year tour here on the moon four 
volunteers were placed in 
hypothermia aboard this ship — ap- 
propriately named The Four Com- 
panions — which under computer 
control was sent out to an orbit be- 
yond Pluto. One year later the 
present automatics roused the men 
for what was to be their second con- 
secutive tour away from Earth. 
They were isolated, of course, as 
few human beings had been before. 
But they had ample supplies, 
facilities for recreation and enough 
research work to keep them occu- 
pied all the time. In theory they 
would end the experiment in no 
worse shape than they had been at 
the end of their Luna tour. In 
practice, however — ” 

The dim figure beside the screen 
shrugged. “I supposed it was for- 
tunate the vital control and life-sup- 



166 



GALAXY 




port systems of The Four Com- 
panions were safe behind armored 
bulkheads.” 

T HE reasons for the doctor’s 
last remark were immediately 
apparent in the next scene. A 
shocked indrawing of breath be- 
came audible as the lens of the 
camera peered at the unbelievable 
shambles within the spaceship. 
Furnishings were smashed to kin- 
dling — experimental apparatus was 
wrecked beyond recognition — the 
walls had been battered as if hit 
blindly and repeatedly by a 
madman with a club. Worst of all 
was a partly decayed corpse 
sprawled in the foreground, its 
broken skull centered on a huge 
stain which was obviously long 
dried. 

“He was not the only one.” 
Fielden’s voice was dry and care- 
fully devoid of emotion. “Another 
was found in the storage deck with 
a knife in his back, a third in the 
emergency airlock. That one ap- 
parantly died when he opened the 
outer door without the protection 
of a suit — in fact, as naked as the 
day he was born.” 

There was movement on the 
screen and the two men from the 
crawler reappeared supporting 
between them a shambling thing 
which at first seemed only partly 
human. But beneath the dirt and 
hair was the sick, blank-eyed face 
of what had once been a man. 
Doctor Fielden touched a control 



and the screen blanked. As the 
lights flared high, he looked at his 
stunned audience and said quietly, 
“That man has since been cured, 
though I understand he has never 
made a full comeback. Small re- 
compense I think, for the fact he 
and his friends broke completely 
under conditions we had assumed 
were perfectly safe.” 

Hender had had enough. As a 
catharsis for his anger he abruptly 
rose to his feet and snapped, “I 
don’t know what all this is leading 
to, but it’s pretty damn obvious the 
six of us here have contradicted the 
results of that so-called ex- 
periment.” He took a deep breath. 
“How do you explain that?” 

Hender sat down amid several 
shouts of approval. He looked at 
Marguerite and felt comforted by 
her reassuring gaze. 

Fielden rubbed a hand over his 
eyes. He was tired and looked it. 
“Well, Mr. Hender, let me put it 
this way. We gambled when we sent 
you to Alpha Centauri. Though we 
knew the star had planets, there 
was no way of telling if any of the 
planets were habitable by man. In 
fact, we would have considered 
ourselves lucky if you had found 
even a world where you could live 
after a fashion under a pressure 
dome. What did happen, of course, 
was the last thing anyone ex- 
pected — Alpha Five. With a 
breathable atmosphere, tolerable 
gravity, food sources compatible 
with human needs — the planet was

so Earthlike, your physiological 
systems were fooled into believing 
it was Earth. Hence your con- 
tinuing rationality even after three 
more years here in Erathosthenes.” 
In a stage whisper everyone could 
plainly hear, the irrepressible Brian 
McEvoy commented, “Now ain’t 
that nice. We got no hangups!” 
Marcus Fielden smilingly shook 
his head. “Not necessarily. Please 
don’t forget you must still face rein- 
troduction into Earth society — a 
process you may find more than a 
little difficult. But I believe we have 
prepared you well enough for that 
particular adjustment. And you 
will always be able to remind your- 
self that if it were not for Alpha 
Five — ” 

Sidetracked by an obviously un- 
pleasant train of thought, the 
scientist’s face darkened. After a 
moment he continued: “On the 
basis of what common sense tells 
me is the extreme scarcity of Earth- 
like worlds in the galaxy, plus the 
results of what Mr. Hender named 
‘that so-called experiment,’ I rather 
hope I will not be around when 
Enterprise returns from Barnard’s 
Star.” 

Extract from report by 
Marcus R. Fielden to the 
Executive Council of the World 
Space Agency: Though the 
results of the Four Com- 
panions experiment proved the 
fallacy of our previous conclu- 
sions about hypothermia, the 



success is nevertheless heart- 
ening. Of course this unex- 
pected bonus only partially 
offsets the unpleasant fact 
that landings on non-Earth 
type planets must henceforth 
be limited to quick ‘look-ins’ if 
we are to avoid the unpleasant 
consequences demonstrated by 
the experiment. I suppose the 
necessity for quarantine could 
be avoided if we restricted 
future crews to close-orbit re- 
search, though such limited 
missions would hardly justify 
their enormous expense. 

Regarding the ether three 
missions, I must remind you of 
the astronomical odds against 
their finding another Alpha 
Five. So, to avoid repeats of the 
Four Companions tragedy, I 
suggest the members of each 
crew be again placed under 
hypothermia as soon as they 
return and kept on ice until an 
answer is found. Some future 
generation will then have to act 
according to its own ethics, 
though God knows I do not 
envy them such a decision if no 
answer is possible. 

One final point. As you 
know, I was concerned about 
how the Golden Hind crew 
would adjust to human society 
after an absence of half a 
century. After all, much has 
changed during that time. Es- 
pecially delicate was the 
problem of immediate rela-

tives, and George Header’s is a 
classic case. When I had his 
daughter notified of his im- 
pending arrival . 

T HE shuttles were larger and 
more luxurious than the more 
primitive models he remembered 
and, because of powered reentry, 
subjected their passengers to a 
much gentler ride. But as Hender 
rode down from orbit he paid little 
attention to these refinements. 
Instead he spent almost the whole 
trip staring with agonized intensity 
at the entertainment screen. 
Marguerite Walsh knew this was 
one battle he would have to fight 
alone, so she sensibly kept quiet 
and watched him. She had seen the 
picture of his daughter as he once 
had known her and she understood 
the terrible sense of loss he must 
have felt when viewphone contact 
had been made from Orbital 
Station Eight. 

Wendoline Reed (nee Hender) 
was now a middle-aged widow with 
four grandchildren. She had lived 
most of her life while her father 
spent forty-four of the past forty- 
nine years in frozen suspension 
between the stars. Hender had al- 
ways known, of course, the change 
that must occur in his daughter 
over those years. But that had been 
a conscious awareness, based on his 
knowledge that the calendars of 
Earth had still turned as the crew of 
Golden Hind remained in their 
hypothermia vaults. But his body, 



his glands, his instincts were only 
five years older — they knew the 
child of his flesh must only be 
thirteen; a gawky, preadolescent 
version of the merry eight-year-old 
who asked for a star teddy. 
Hender’s conflict with himself was 
serious, and Marguerite had seen 
his shock when the graying lady 
with the maternal figure and the 
kind smile had appeared on the 
screen. 

“My God,” he had whispered. 
“She looks like my mother!” 

But despite her own undoubted 
conflict, Mrs. Reed had acquitted 
herself nobly, welcoming her father 
with the gay and surprised chatter 
of someone meeting an old friend. 
Hender on the other hand had said 
very little, and as the shuttle knifed 
down through the stratosphere 
toward touchdown, Marguerite 
wondered if the trauma of society 
reentry would be merely tempo- 
rary. Hender might very well need 
her professional — and womanly — 
services longer than either had sup- 
posed. And it was with only a slight 
twinge of guilt that she realized she 
did not mind at all. 

The welcoming ceremonies were 
fortunately brief — the Agency had 
planned them so under advisement 
from Marcus Fielden. But the 
overwhelming presence of tens of 
thousands of people behind the se- 
curity barriers had a noticeably dis- 
concerting effect upon the six as- 
tronauts. They lined up nervously 
as the president of the World Union 



SIX MEN FROM ALPHA

shook their hands and presented 
each with the W. U. award for 
meritorious service. And the thun- 
derous roar of approval as they 
entered the presidential plane 
caused them to scramble up the 
ramp like shy animals heading for 
cover. 

Marguerite accompanied Hender 
to a cabin at the rear of the aircraft 
where Mrs. Reed was waiting to 
greet her father in person. The 
younger woman watched a little un- 
comfortably as two strangers, con- 
nected by the closest ties of blood 
yet separated by nearly half a 
century, tried toact toward each 
other as society would expect. 

After a quick embrace Hender 
presented his painstaking version of 
a star teddy. It was gray and blue 
and fluffy and had a sharp little 
snout, above which was a single 
multi-faceted eye. Though a 
creation out of his imagination, it 
had charming plausibility. 

“Do you remember you asked for 
this?” Hender asked awkwardly. 
“Well, here’s your star teddy.” 

To Marguerite’s astonishment, 
Mrs. Reed was delighted. She held 
up the doll by its forelimbs and ex- 
claimed happily, “Of course I re- 
member! I even remember no one 
could convince me you weren’t 
going to bring it to me before that 
Christmas. Wait till I tell my 
grandchildren about this!” 

The muscles in Hender’ s face 
tightened convulsively. “So I’m a 
great-grandfather.” 



Mrs. Reed look at him with sur- 
prise. “Didn’t they tell you?” 

“Oh, yes. It’s just that it’s all 
so — ” Hender floundered help- 
lessly — “difficult.” 

Marguerite’s heart ached. He is 
so alone. I wonder if he will ever be 
able to look that dear lady in the 
face and call her Wendy? Or 
'daughter?' Their relationship 
seems ludicrous and / suppose they 
both know it. And it is her problem, 
too. How can she possibly think of 
that young man as her father? 

But the problem did not arise. As 
if by unspoken agreement Hender 
and Mrs. Reed adopted the simple 
expedient of talking to each other 
without the use of either name or 
title, though to third parties they 
seemed willing to refer to “my 
father” or “my daughter.” 
Otherwise the unaccustomed 
pressures upon all the astronauts 
remained — within hours after the 
plane delivered the president and 
his guests to the World Union com- 
plex in Geneva, they were obliged 
to attend a banquet given by the 
House of Assembly. 

I T WAS a strained and rather 
strange affair, during which the 
guests of honor merely toyed with 
their food and — as the proceedings 
dragged on — began to display 
various signs of irritability. Though 
seated between Marguerite and 
Mrs. Reed, Hender seemed disin- 
clined to talk to either and spent 
most of the time drawing nervous

circles on the tablecloth with edge 
of a fork. He smiled sardonically 
when Weldon Gill was persuaded to 
say a few terse words, but lost 
interest again when Marcus Fielden 
began the main address on behalf of 
the six men from Alpha Five. 

As Fielden spoke no one paid 
much attention to the marine who 
cat-footed behind the head table 
and whispered into the ear of 
Senator Wu Pao Wong, the distin- 
guished Chinese seated on Brian 
McEvoy’s left. It concerned, as it 
turned out later, a matter whose 
importance had been inflated by an 
overly zealous aide. But the marine 
had his instructions and, as he 
obeyed them, he leaned between the 
Senator and the astronaut to de- 
liver his top-secret message. 
Inadvertently he knocked over a 
carafe of water which spilled its 
contents into McEvoy’s lap. Before 
the embarrassed marine had a 
chance to apologize McEvoy jab- 
bed his elbow into the leaning 
man’s midriff and shouted, “You 
clumsy bastard!” Then he leaped 
out of his scat and flung himself on 
the gasping marine with maniacal 
rage. 

Shocked out of his moody intros- 
pection by the sudden fracas, 
Hender stared astonished as 
someone yelled, “Grab him!” Two 
burly guards sprinted from their 
stations at the back of the hall, 
hauled the yelling astronaut off his 
victim and hustled him through a 
side door. 



Got to help him. Hender thought 
automatically, hardly aware he had 
already pushed back his chair and 
risen to his feet. Marguerite called 
something to him, but he did not 
hear her in the mounting confusion 
as he joined Fielden and Gill and 
the others and hurried after the 
guards. 

A fast moving medic had already 
gotten to McEvoy by the time they 
caught up with him in the adjoining 
lobby. Reacting to the drug the 
medic had just pumped into his 
system, the youngest of the as- 
tronauts barely had enough 
strength to lift his head and 
mumble, “Sorry — ” before he sag- 
ged limply in the arms of his 
expressionless captors. 

Fieldon pointed. “Put him on 
that couch, please.” To the medic. 
“What did you give him?” 

“Kirul B.” The medic snapped 
his case shut, looked up and added 
reassuringly. “It’s harmless. He’ll 
be out of it in about four hours.” 
“He had better be,” Fielden said. 
He briefly examined the uncon- 
scious man, stood errect and asked, 
“How is the fellow he attacked?” 
“I’m all right sir,” called a 
slightly hoarse voice. The marine 
pushed his way to the front of the 
gathering crowd, his face anxious. 
“But how is Mr. McEvoy?” 

Fielden patted the man’s 
uniformed arm. “Considering what 
he almost did to you, young man, I 
appreciate your concern. Anyway 
we’ll let you know.”

The scientist turned back to the banquet, Weldon Gill killed 
medic. “Have McEvoy taken up to himself. The circumstances were 
my suite please. I’ll be up directly.” described in a further report from 
“Yes, sir.” Marcus Fielden to the Executive 

As the medic led the two guards Council of the W.S. A.: 



and their unconscious burden 
towards the elevators, Gill asked, 
“What about the rest of us, 
Marcus? Something tells me we 
need a conference.” 

“Agreed.” Fielden’s grim gaze 
picked out the remaining five as- 
tronauts from the several dozen 
people who had crowded out of the. 
banquet hall. “Gentlemen, I want 
to see you upstairs in half an hour. 
Subject for discussion — ” he 
scowled angrily — “your future!” 
Hender watched the little 
scientist hurry away. Then a warm 
presence pressed close to him and a 
familiar voice said, “Honey, you 
don’t look well.” 

“My head aches.” 

“Otherwise?” 

He looked away. “Otherwise I 
feel lousy.” 

She frowned worriedly. “That’s 
what I thought. George, you’re all 
suffering from — something.” 
Something? Well, that was one 
way of putting it, he supposed bit- 
terly. Someone began to laugh — 
the sound was harsh and without 
humor. But it was only when 
Marguerite looked at him with 
pained surprise, he realized the 
laugh was his own. 

ALITTLE less than two months 
II. after the incident at the 



... so it obvious an even 
further factor had entered the 
picture. For the second time in 
almost as many days I again 
had to revise my thinking about 
the future of the interstellar 
program. There is still a price 
to pay, of course, and Gill was 
the first to pay it. But I am con- 
vinced that in the long run 
intersellar man will evolve to 
heights unheard of on this 
small planet. It is as if Nature 
herself had a hand in this when 
she gave man this intersellar 
trigger which can only be 
released once — but which, once 
released, forces him to become 
a creature of the cosmos. 

You know by now, of course, 
that Gill chose to remain on 
Earth because of his desire to 
have full vision restored. He 
was aware of the risk he was 
taking and agreed to become a 
test subject for our team of 
psychologists. But as I watched 
the accelerating deterioration 
of this strong personality it be- 
came almost impossible to 
maintain my scientific ob- 
jectivity. Even the success of 
the eye transplants had little ef- 
fect on his downward slide and 
his suicide was inevitable. 



172 



GALAXY 




The total desperation of his 
condition is best illustrated by 
the fact he knew the operation 
was a success and knew that 
within a month the healing 
process would be sufficiently 
advanced to enable him to join 
the others on Luna. However 
his private hell had become too 
intolerable to be borne even a 
moment longer, so he took 
what seemed the only logical 
way out. 

The work on Golden Hind II 
is right on schedule and she will 
shortly be moved to Luna orbit 
from where she will begin the 
return voyage to Alpha Five. 
The colonists are in good 
spirits and have voiced no ob- 
jections to their cramped 
quarters aboard the ship. Un- 
fortunately hypothermia equip- 
ment for four extra persons 
takes up a lot of space, so the 
crowding is necessary. 

Regarding the selection of 
personnel for the Amazon 
Project, I am fully aware that 
suitable female candidates do 
not, as it were, “grow on 
trees.” So I suggest that steps 
be taken to organize an 
intensive selection and training 
program that will . 

Golden Hind II was ready to 
leave. 

Captain George Hender and his 
wife — and the other four male 
members of the second Centauri 



expedition and their wives — sat be- 
fore a large video screen in a lounge 
of the Clavius Luna Complex. On 
the screen the image of Dr. Marcus 
Fielden loomed twice as large as 
life. 

“I had wanted to be on Luna 
when this moment came,” the 
scientist said regretfully, “but I am 
afraid the Agency ruled otherwise.” 

“A ruling based on your own rec- 
ommendations,” Hender pointed 
out. “After all, Marcus, you have 
served your three years. Now you 
have to be satisfied with terra 
firma.” 

Fielden smiled. “True. But at 
least I know where I belong. You 
people, on the other hand, are going 
to be like kids in a candy store. 
With the whole universe to choose 
from, which goody do you go to 
next?” 

Which indeed? As more ships be- 
came available, Hender knew that 
Alpha Five would not hold him for 
long. Earthlike or alien, with or 
without pressure domes, all worlds 
were now grist for the starman’s 
mill. 

All except one. 

Marguerite stirred beside him. 
“Strange,” she said. 

The image on the screen cocked a 
quizical eyebrow. “Strange?” 

“Knowing I can never return to 
Earth again.” She twisted her 
hands together nervously. 

“It isn’t too late, you know,” 
Fielden said. Across a quarter of a 
million miles of space and through 



SIX MEN FROM ALPHA

the screen it seemed the huge eyes 
looked directly at her husband. 
“Well, George?” 

Hender accepted the hint. 
Turning to his bride of less than a 
week, he took one of her hands in 
his. 

Then, gently: “You heard the 
man. What do you want to do?” 

She forced a smile. “Sorry dear. 
You’re not going to get rid of me 
that easily.” 

From his office in one of Earth’s 
great universities, Fielden nodded 
approvingly. “Marguerite, do you 
feel any — ah — symptoms?” 

She grimaced. “I feel tired.” 
“Nothing else?” 

“I don’t think so.” 

The man on Earth looked 
relieved. “I’m glad to hear that. 
For a three-year-plus you are not 
doing badly at all. And you will be 
in hypothermia in a few hours, so 
you can look forward to sleeping 
the years away until you get to 
Alpha Five.” 

“Gill’s World,” corrected Brian 
McEvoy. 

Fielden blinked. “I beg your 
pardon?” 

The young astronaut grinned. Re- 
laxed and completely recovered 
from his bout with Terran 
Madness, he repeated, “Gill’s 
World. We agreed that should be 
the name for the planet.” He added 
earnestly: “I hope you can talk the 
Agency into making it official — ” 
“Gill’s World, eh?” The scientist 
was clearly pleased by the sug- 



gestion. “A fine tribute to a good 
man.” 

McEvoy hugged the blond girl at 
his side. “Not that it matters — 
unless you want to reach us. If you 
do, that’s the address.” 

Suddenly feeling his years, 
Marcus Fielden slumped back into 
his chair and stared at the five men 
on his screen. They were the first 
representatives of a new breed. It 
would be a long time before science 
knew how they had got that way — 
what mysterious mechanism had 
caused Earth to reject them. Some- 
thing peculiar in the air and ecology 
of Gill’s World? The possibility was 
one of the reasons two of the 
women trained biochemists. If an 
answer were found, it was certain 
Marguerite Hender and her four fe- 
male companions would have as 
much a part in the finding as their 
men. They were determined young 
persons who would surely redefine 
the role of their sex — and why not? 
The archaic social customs of Earth 
would have little meaning on a 
world that made men aliens on their 
home planet. 

In fact, Fielden told himself rue- 
fully, I doubt their descendants of 
ten thousand years hence will have 
even heard of Earth. 

T HE crew of Enterprise had not 
found any habitable planets 
around Barnard’s Star. But one 
world’s strange life forms, existing 
in near vacuum, had occupied them 
in fascinated study for twenty-three 



174 



GALAXY 




months. Then they had reentered 
hypothermia aboard their starship, 
expecting eventual revival amid the 
familiar worlds of Sol. They did not 
know of the high-energy signal 
speeding toward them at the ve- 
locity of light. Similar signals from 
even more powerful transmitters 
were on their way towards Lalande 
21185 and Epsilon Eridani. 

Enterprise was still more than 
five light-years from Earth when its 
detectors picked up the First pulse. 
Like a huge metal flower its high- 
gain immediately deployed one 
hundred meter fine-mesh petals to 
gather in the complex code that 
followed. The message was 
received and recorded and ac- 
knowledged in approximately one 
hundred and three seconds. The 
ship’s computer control then 
withdrew the high-gain back into its 
folded position, rolled and turned 
the vessel until its command 
module was pointed on another but 



equally precise heading. 

Another two hundred and 
eighteen seconds went by as circuits 
were checked and verified. 

Finally electronic instructions 
were channeled through the control 
core, past the landing module 
housing and fuel tanks to a slave 
computer within the drive module. 
The slave responded. Banked 
nuclear fires within the drive’s 
shielded core gradually returned to 
life, pumping megawatts of power 
into huge control coils. A trail of 
faint luminescence appeared 
between the coils as charged nuc- 
lear particles were hurled away 
from the ship at fractionally less 
than the speed of light. 

Enterprise was on its way toward 
Alpha Centauri. 

At about the same time another 
starship, Amazon I, lifted from 
Earth toward deep space. 

To be the problem of the men 
from Alpha. ★
