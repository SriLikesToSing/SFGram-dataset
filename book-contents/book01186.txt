EDITORIAL 



THE MYTH OF THE LIGHT-BARRIER 

The 1970’s has been a decade in which every physical and spiritual 
boundary has drawn progressively inward until finally hope itself seems 
threatened with extinction. This, more than any other reason, is why, while 
occupying this chair, I have consistently sought out and tried to promulgate 
the overlooked positive factor, the factor that implies that maybe we have a 
chance after all — that maybe the deck is not inherently rigged against us. 
That maybe, just maybe, we have a destiny worth having. 

To this end I now offer the thought that the speed of light as limiting 
velocity is not a “barrier” that will keep the stars forever from our grasp, 
but is instead the guarantor of future freedom — from persecution or be- 
nevolent interference! — for those who will someday seek their fortunes 
beyond the confines of the Solar System. 

Consider. At relativistic velocities time “slows down” as compared to 
the Universe at large. (Most sf-oriented persons are at least vaguely aware 
of the implications of Relativity Theory — for those who are not, I heartily 
recommend TAU ZERO, by Poul Anderson, as an entertaining and indeed 
inspiring way of rectifying this omission.) What most people — even sf 
people — seem not to be aware of is how much time slows down. At one 
gravity acceleration it would take about twenty years to reach the center of 
the Milky Way. 

Note that I do not say it would seem to take twenty years, but that it 
would take twenty years. Of course the Universe will have aged 100,000 
years or so, but that’s another matter. A paradox? If so, a relativistic one; 
the single most fundamental tenet of Einstein’s theory is that all frames of 
reference are equally valid — including the ship-board one. 

And that’s the point. Given a one-gravity, constant-acceleration space- 
vehicle plus a complete indifference to point of origin, you can go any- 
where and do anything. You can even be free. Because anybody who 
might have an inclination to tamper with your liberty (unless you were 
foolish enough to bring him along) will have been dust long before you 
arrive at your destination. Blue meanies included. Freedom!

Welcome to Infemoland! 



M. THOUGHT ABOUT BEING DEAD. 

I could remember every silly de- 
tail of that silly last performance. I 
was dead at the end of it. But how 
could I think about being dead if I 
had died? 

I thought about that, too, after I 



stopped having hysterics. There was 
plenty of time to think. 

Call me Allen Carpentier. It’s the 
name I wrote under, and someone 
will remember it. I was one of the 
best known science fiction writers 
in the world, and I had a lot of 

7 



fans. My stories weren’t the kind 
that win awards, but they enter- 
tained, and I had written a lot of 
them. The fans all knew me. Some- 
one ought to remember me. 

It was the fans who killed me. At 
least, they let me do it. It’s an old 
game. At science fiction conven- 
tions the fans try to get their favo- 
rite author washed-out stinking 
drunk. Then they can go home and 
tell stories about how Allen Carpen- 
tier really tied one one and they 
were right there to see it. They add 
to the stories until legends are built 
around what writers do at conven- 
tions. It’s all in fun. They really 
like me, and I like them. 

I think I do. But the fans vote the 
Hugo awards, and you have to be 
popular to win. I’d been nominated 
five times for awards and never 
won one, and I was out to make 
friends that year. Instead of hiding 
in a back booth with other writers I 
was at a fan party, drinking with a 
room-full of short ugly kids with 
pimples, tall serious Harvard types, 
girls with long stringy hair, half- 
pretty girls half-dressed to show it, 
and damned few people with good 
manners. 

Remember the drinking party in 
War and Peace ? Where one of the 
characters bets he can sit on a win- 
dow ledge and drink a whole bottle 
of rum without touching the sides? I 
made the same bet. 

The Convention hotel was a big 
one, and the room was eight stories 
up. I climbed out and sat with my 
feet dangling against the smooth 
stone building. The smog had 
blown away and Los Angeles was 
beautiful. Even with the energy 
shortage there were lights 

8 



everywhere, moving rivers of light 
on the freeways, blue glows from 
swimming pools near the hotel, a 
grid of light stretching out as far as 
I could see. Somewhere out there 
were fireworks, but I don’t know 
what they were celebrating. 

They handed me the rum. 
“You’re a real sport, Allen,” said a 
middle-aged adolescent. He had 
acne and halitosis, but he published 
one of the biggest science fiction 
newsletters around. He wouldn’t 
have known a literary reference if it 
bit him on the nose. “Hey, that’s a 
long way down.” 

“Right. Beautiful night, isn’t it? 
Arcturus up there, see it? Star with 
the largest proper motion. Moved a 
couple of degrees in the last three 
thousand years. Almost races 
along.” 

Carpentier’s trivial last words: a 
meaningless lecture to people who 
not only knew it already, but had 
read it in my own work. I took the 
rum and tilted my head back to 
drink. 

It was like drinking flaming bat- 
tery acid. There was no pleasure in 
it. I’d regret this tomorrow. But the 
fans began to shout behind me, and 
that made me feel good until I saw 
why. Asimov had come in. Asimov 
wrote science articles and histories 
and straight novels and commen- 
taries on the Bible and Byron and 
Shakespeare, and he turned out 
more material in a year than anyone 
else writes in a lifetime. I used to 
steal data and ideas from his col- 
umns. The fans were shouting for 
him, while I risked my neck to give 
them the biggest performance of all 
the Drunken Conventiones of Allen 
Carpentier. 



GALAXY 




With nobody watching. 

The bottle was half empty when 
my gag reflex cut in and spilled 
used rum into my nose and sinuses. 
I jacknifed forward to cough it out 
of my lungs and pitched right on 
over. 

I don’t think anyone saw me fall. 

It was an accident, a stupid acci- 
dent caused by stupid drunkenness, 
and it was all the fans’ fault any- 
way. They had no business letting 
me do it! And it was an accident, I 
know it was. I wasn’t feeling that 
sorry for myself. 

The city was still alive with 
lights. A big Roman candle burst 
with brilliant pinpoints of yellows 
and greens against the starry skies. 
The view was pleasant as I floated 
down the side of the hotel. 

It seemed to take a long time to 
get to the bottom. 



II 

The big surprise was that I could 
be surprised. That I could be any- 
thing. That I could be. 

I was, but I wasn’t. I thought I 
could see, but there was only a 
bright uniform metallic color of 
bronze. Sometimes there were faint 
sounds, but they didn’t mean any- 
thing. And when I looked down, I 
couldn’t see myself. 

When I tried to move, nothing 
happened. It felt as if I had moved. 
My muscles sent the right position 
signals. But nothing happened, no- 
thing at all. 

I couldn’t touch anything, not 
even myself. I couldn’t feel any- 
thing, or see anything, or sense any- 
thing except my own posture. I 

INFERNO 



knew when I was sitting, or stand- 
ing, or walking, or running, or 
doubled up like a contortionist, but 
I felt nothing at all. 

I screamed. I could hear the 
scream, and I shouted for help. No- 
thing answered. 

Dead. I had to be dead. But dead 
men don’t think about death. What 
do dead men think about? Dead 
men don’t think. I was thinking, but 
I was dead. That struck me as 
funny and set off hysterics, and 
then I’d get myself under control 
and go round and round with it 
again. 

Dead. This was like nothing any 
religion had ever taught. Not that 
I’d ever caught any of the religions 
going' around, but none had warned 
of this. I certainly wasn’t in 
Heaven, and it was too lonely to be 
Hell. 

It's like this, Carpentier: this is 
Heaven, but you’re the only one 
who ever made it. Hah! 

I couldn’t be dead. What, then? 
Frozen? Frozen! That’s it, they’ve 
made me a corpsicle! The Conven- 
tion was in Los Angeles where the 
frozen dead movement started and 
where it has the most supporters. 
They must have frozen me, put me 
in a double-walled coffin with 
liquid nitrogen all around me, and 
when they tried to revive me the re- 
vival didn’t work. What am I now? 
A brain in a bottle, fed by color- 
coded tubes? Why don’t they try to 
talk to me? 

Why don’t they kill me? 

Maybe they still have hopes of 
waking me. Hope. Maybe there’s 
hope after all. 

It was flattering, at first, to think 
of teams of specialists working to 

9 




make me human again. The fans! 
They’d realized it was their fault 
and they’d paid for this! How far in 
the future would 1 wake up? What 
would it be like? Even the defini- 
tion of human might have changed. 

Would they have immortality? 
Stimulation of psychic power cen- 
ters in the brain? Empires of 
thousands of worlds? I’d written 
about all of these, and my books 
would still be around! I’d be fam- 
ous. I’d written about — 

I’d written stories about future 
cultures raiding corpsicles for spare 
parts, transplants. Had that hap- 
pened to me? My body broken up 
for spares? Then why was I still 
alive? 

Because they couldn’t use my 
brain. 

Then let them throw it out! 

Maybe they just couldn’t use it 
yet. 

I couldn’t tell how long I was 
there. There was no sense of time 
passing. I screamed a lot. I ran 
nowhere forever, to no purpose: I 
couldn’t run out of breath, I never 
reached a wall. I wrote novels, do- 
zens of them, in my head, with no 
way to write them down. I relived 
that last convention party a 
thousand times. I played games 
with myself. I remembered every 
detail of my life, with a brutal hon- 
esty I’d never had before; what else 
could I do? All through it, I was 
terrified of going mad, and then I’d 
fight the terror, because that could 
drive me mad — 

I think I did not go mad. But it 
went on, and on, and on, until I 
was screaming again. 

Get me out of here! Please, any- 

10 



one, someone, get me out of here! 

Nothing happened, of course. 

Pull the plug and let me die! 
Make it stop! Get me out of here! 

Nothing. 

Hey, Carpentier. Remember THE 
CHILL? Your hero was a corpsicle, 
and they'd let his temperature drop 
too low. His nervous system had 
become a superconductor. Nobody 
knew he was alive in there, frozen 
solid, but thinking, screaming in his 
head, feeling the awful cold- 

No! For the love of God, get me 
out of here! 

I was lying on my left side in a 
field, with dirt under me and warm 
light all around me. I was staring at 
my navel and I could see it! It was 
the most beautiful sight I’d ever im- 
agined. I was afraid to move; my 
navel and I might pop like a soap 
bubble. It took a long time to get 
the nerve to lift my head. 

I could see my hands and feet 
and the rest of me. When I moved 
my fingers I could see them wrig- 
gle. 

There wasn’t a thing wrong with 
me. It was as if I had never fallen 
eight stories to be smashed into jel- 
ly- 

I was clothed in a loose white 
gown partly open down the front. 
Not very surprising, but where was 
the hospital? Surely they didn’t wa- 
ken Sleepers in the middle of a 
field? 

They? I couldn’t see anyone else. 
There was a field of dirt, trampled 
here and there, sloping downhill to 
become a shiny mud flat. I raised 
my head, and he was standing be- 
hind me. A fat man, tall but dumpy 
and chunky enough that at first I 

GALAXY 




didn’t notice his height. His jaw 
was massively square and jutted 
out, the first thing I noticed about 
his face. He had wide lips and a 
high forehead, and short, blunt, 
powerful fingers. He wore a hospi- 
tal gown something like the one I 
was wearing. 

He was beautiful. Everything was 
beautiful. But my navel? Mag- 
nifique! 

“You are well?” he asked. 

He spoke with an accent: 
Mediterranean; Spanish, perhaps, or 
Italian. He was looking closely at 
me, and he asked again. “You are 
well?” 

“Yes. I think so. Where am I?” 

He shrugged. “Always they ask 
that question first. Where do you 
think you are?” 

I shook my head, and grinned for 
the pleasure of it. 

It was pleasure to move, to see 
myself move, to feel my buttocks 
press against the dirt and know 
something would oppose my 
movements. It was ecstacy to see 
myself in the bright light around 
me. I looked up at the sky. 

Okay, there has to be a sky. I 
know that. But I saw nothing. 
Thick clouds? But there was no de- 
tail to the clouds, just a uniform 
grey above me. Even in my 
sensation-starved condition it was 
ugly. 

I was in the middle of a field of 
dirt that stretched a couple a miles 
to some low brown hills. There 
were people on the hills, a lot of 
them, running after something I 
couldn’t make out. I sat up to scan 
the horizon. 

The hills ran up against a high 
wall that stretched in both directions 

INFERNO 



as far as I could see. It seemed 
straight as a mathematician’s line, 
but I sensed the slightest of inward 
curves just before it vanished into 
deep gloom. There was something 
wrong with the perspective, but I 
can’t describe precisely what, just 
that it didn’t seem right. 

The hills and the mud flats 
formed a wide strip between the 
wall and a fast-moving river of wa- 
ter black as ink. The river was a 
mile away and didn’t seem very 
wide at that distance. 1 could see it 
perfectly, another perceptual distor- 
tion because it was too far away for 
the details I could make out. 

Beyond the river were green 
fields and white Mediterranean vil- 
las, walled complexes with the 
squat classical look to them, some 
quite large. They weren’t arranged 
in any order, and the effect was 
very pleasing. I turned back to the 
wall. 

Not very high, I thought. High 
enough to be trouble climbing, 
perhaps two or three times my six 
feet high. I was hampered by the 
perspective problem. The nearest 
point of the wall might have been a 
mile away or ten — though ten 
seemed ridiculous. 

I took a deep breath and didn’t 
like the smells. Fetid, with an acrid 
tinge, decay and sickly-sweet per- 
fume to cover the smells of death, 
orange blossoms mingled with hos- 
pital smells, all subtle enough that I 
hadn’t noticed them before, but sick- 
ening all the same. I won’t mention 
the smells often, but they were al- 
ways there. Most stinks you get 
used to and soon don’t notice, but 
this had too much in the blend and 
the blend changed too often. You’d 

11 




just get used to one and there’d be 
another. 

Beside me on the ground was a 
small bronze bottle with a classical 
beaker shape. I figured it would 
hold maybe a quart. Except for the 
man standing above me there wasn’t 
another blessed thing. 

“Never mind where I am,” I 
said. “Where have I been? I don’t 
remember passing out. I was 
screaming, and here I am. Where 
was I?” 

“First you ask where you are. 
Then where you were. Do you think 
of nothing else you should say?” 
He was frowning disapproval, as if 
he didn’t like me at all. So what the 
hell was he doing here? 

Breaking me out of wherever I’d 
been, of course. “Yeah. Thanks.” 
“You should thank the One who 
sent me to you.” 

“Who was that?” 

“You asked Him for help — ” 

“I don’t remember asking anyone 
for help.” But this time I’d heard 
him pronounce the capital letter. 
“Yeah. ‘For the love of God,’ I 
said. Well?” 

The fat meaty lips twitched, and 
his eyes filled with concern. When 
he looked at me it wasn’t in dis- 
taste, but in sympathy. “Very well. 
You will have a great deal to leam. 
First, I answer your questions. 
Where are you? You are dead, and 
you lie on the ground of the Ves- 
tibule to Hell. Where were you?” 
He kicked the bronze bottle with a 
sandalled foot. “In there.” 

Hot diggity damn. I’m in the nut 
hatch and the head looney’s come 
to talk to me. 

Carpentier wakes up a thousand 
years after his last flight and sloppy 

12 



landing, and already he’s in trouble. 
Spoons and forks and chopsticks, 
traffic lights, the way a man puts 
his pants on, all may have to be re- 
learned. Law and customs change in 
a thousand years. This society may 
not even recognize Carpentier as 
sane. 

But wake him in a 30th century 
looney bin among thirtieth century 
twitchies, and now what? How can 
he adjust to anything? 

There were other bottles sitting 
unattended on the dirt, some larger 
than mine, some smaller. I don’t 
know why I hadn’t noticed them be- 
fore. I picked one up and dropped it 
quick. It burned my fingers, and 
there were faint sounds coming 
from inside it. 

It sounded like human speech in 
a foreign language, a voice scream- 
ing curses. That tone couldn’t be 
anything else. Endless curses 
screamed — 

Why would they put radios in old 
bronze bottles and scatter them 
through the looney bin? My 
hypothesis needed more work. 

The people up on the hills were 
still running. They’d looped back to 
about where I’d first seen them, and 
whatever it was they chased, they 
hadn’t caught it yet. Do they let the 
nuts run in circles in futuristic 
looney bins? 

Where had I been? Where? There 
wasn’t any hospital around here, no 
facilities for keeping all or part of a 
corpsicle, nothing but this crazy 
man and a lot of bronze bottles and 
people running in circles and — and 
insects of some kind. Something 
whined and did a kamikaze into my 
ear. Something else stung me on the 
back of the neck. I slapped franti- 



GALAXY 




cally, but there wasn’t anything to 
see. 

It felt good even to hurt myself 
slapping. 

My ‘rescuer’ was patiently wait- 
ing for me to make some response. 
It wouldn’t hurt to humor him until 
I had more information. 

“Okay, I’m in the vestibule of 
Hell and I was in a bottle. A djinn 
bottle. How long?” I told him the 
date on which I’d fallen from the 
window. 

He shrugged. “You will find that 
time has not the same meaning here 
as you are accustomed to. We have 
all the time we will ever need. 
Eternity lies before us. I am unable 
to tell you how long you were in 
that beaker, but I can assure you it 
is not important.” 

Not important? I almost went 
mad in there! The realization made 
me start to shiver, and he dropped 
to his knees beside me, all concern, 
to put a hand on my shoulder. 

“It is over now. God will not al- 
low you back into the bottle. I can- 
not assure you that there will be no- 
thing worse before you leave Hell. 
There will be much worse. But with 
faith and hope you will endure it, 
and you will be able to leave.” 

“That’s a lot of comfort.” 

“It is infinite comfort. Did you 
not understand? I know a way out 
of here!” 

“Yeah? So do I. Right over that 
wall.” 

He laughed. I listened for a while 
and it got irritating. Finally he 
choked it down to a chuckle. “I’m 
sorry, but they all say that, too. I 
suppose there is nothing for it but to 
let you try. After all — we have 
plenty of time.” He laughed again.

Now what? Would he turn me in 
if I tried to climb the wall? I got 
up, surprised at how good I felt ex- 
cept for the gnats and the smell. My 
imaginary exercises in the bottle — 

Look, wherever I really spent all 
that time, effectively I was in a bot- 
tle, right? It’s a convenient figure of 
speech. Anyway, my exercises in 
the bottle had paid off. I started 
briskly toward the wall. 

Wherever the ground dipped low 
it became squishy mud, anlde-deep, 
with small live things in it. I tried 
to stick to the high ground. The fat 
man kept right alongside me. There 
was no chucking him. After a while 
I said, “If wtf’re going to walk to- 
gether I might as well know your 
name.” 

“Benito. Call me Benny if you 
like.” 

“Okay. Benito.” Benny sounded 
much too friendly. “Look, Benito, 
don’t you want out of here?” 

I hit a nerve. He stopped short, 
his wide face a gamut of emotions 
like nothing I’d ever seen. After a 
long time he said, “Yes.” 

“Then come over the wall with 
me.” 

“I can’t. You can’t. You’ll see.” 
He wouldn’t say anything else, just 
kept pace with me as I walked on. 

And on. 

And on, and on, and on. The 
wall was a long way off. I was 
right about the perspective. We’d 
been walking for over an hour as 
far as I could tell, and the wall 
looked no closer. 

We walked until we were 
exhausted, and it was still a long 
way off. I sat down in the mud to 
slap gnats. “Didn’t seem that far. 
How high is that thing, anyway? 

13 




Must be collossal.” 

“It is no more than three meters 
high.” 

“Don’t be silly.” 

“Look behind you.” 

That was the shock of my life. 
The river was now maybe three 
miles away instead of one. And 
we’d walked for hours. But — 

Benito nodded. “We could walk 
for eternity and never reach the 
wall. And we have eternity. No, 
you don’t believe me. Very well, 
concince yourself. Continue toward 
the wall. Continue until even you 
are certain it can never be reached, 
and then I will tell you how you 
can escape.” 

It took me several hours, but I fi- 
nally believed him. 

The wall was like lightspeed. We 
could get arbitrarily close, but we 
couldn’t ever reach it. Like light- 
speed, or the bottom of a black 
hole, but like nothing else in the 
universe I knew. 

We weren’t going out this way. 
And — and just where were we? 



Ill 

I sat in the dirt and slapped 
gnats while Benito explained it 
again. 

“We are dead and in Hell. This 
is the Vestibule to Hell, where 
those who would make no choices 
in life are condemned. Neither 
warm nor cold, believers nor 
blasphemers — you see them in the 
hills. They chase a banner they will 
never catch.” 

I remembered then. “Dante’s In- 
ferno ?” 

14 



Benito nodded, his big square 
jaw heaving like a broaching whale. 
“You have read the Inferno, then. 
Good. That was the first clue I had 
to the way out of here. We must go 
down — ” 

“Sure, all the way.” Something 
about a lake of ice, and a hole in 
the center of it. It had been a long 
time since I had read Dante. I 
couldn’t see that remembering a 
13th century book would do me any 
good to begin with. This couldn’t 
possibly be the real Hell. Dante’s 
cosmology had been ludicrous, for 
one thing. 

So where was I? “How come 
you’re so sure this is the place 
Dante described?” 

“Where else could it be? All of 
the features are here. All of the de- 
tails.” 

And I’d been dead a long time. 
Centuries? What kind of civilization 
would build an exact copy of 
Dante’s Inferno? An Infernoland. 
Was it part of a larger amusement 
park, like Frontierland in the Dis- 
neyland complex? Or was Inferno- 
land all there was to it? 

Who was Benito? A stooge, or a 
revived corpsicle like me? 

The wall. How had they managed 
that trick? The wall hadn’t moved, 
and I certainly had. Some kind of 
local field effect? A timeslip? Bent 
space? Come on, Carpentier, you 
wrote the stuff. What’s the explana- 
tion? Not the way they did it, just a 
plausible way! 

“First, we must cross the river,” 
Benito was saying. “Do you be- 
lieve me now when I tell you that 
you must not attempt to swim it, or 
even get wet from it, or must you 
try that too?” 



GALAXY 




“What happens if I just dive 
in?” 

“Then you will be as you were 
in the bottle. Aware, and unable to 
move. But it will be very cold, and 
very uncomfortable, and you will be 
there for all eternity knowing you 
put yourself there.” 

I shuddered and slapped a gnat. 
He might be lying. I wasn’t going 
to try it. 

It looked very nice across the 
river, and that was where we had to 
go before we could find Dante 
Alighieri’s escape hole in the center 
of Infemoland. The hell with get- 
ting to the center! Let me get to 
those villas over there and I’d be 
happy enough. “Who’s on the other 
side of the river?” 

“Virtuous pagans,” Benito 
answered. “Those who never knew 
the Word of God, but kept the 
Commandments. They are not 
persecuted. Their fate may be the 
most cruel of all those in this 
place.” 

“Because they aren’t tortured?” 
“Because they think they are 
happy. You’ll find out, let us go 
and see them.” 

“How?” 

“There is a ferry-boat. Once it 
was a rowing boat, but — ’ ’ 

“Got overcrowded in Hell. Too 
many arrivals. Sure.” And in Dis- 
neyland I’d been on a Mississippi 
river boat big enough for fifty or 
sixty people to walk around on. It 
chugged around on a little pond it 
shared with a miniature clipper 
ship. The Builders of Infemoland 
had a sense of humor, putting a fer- 
ryboat in place of Charon’s old 
rowboat. 

Maybe we’d meet some of the 

INFERNO 



paying customers on the ferry. I 
didn’t think Benito was one. He be- 
haved more like a fanatical 
Catholic. 

And what was I? Nobody had gi- 
ven me any role to play. Who in- 
habits Infemoland? 

Who inhabits the Inferno? 

Damned souls. That was my job, 
to play damned soul for the amuse- 
ment of tourists. It wasn’t a role I 
liked very much. 

It took as long to leave the wall 
as it had to go toward it. At least 
they were consistent. There were 
laws to this place, if only I could 
discover them. 

When we passed the bottle that 
had been beside me when I woke 
up, we turned left and angled to- 
ward the river. An old drinking 
song from science fiction conven- 
tions kept running through my head. 
“If hosen and shoon thou never 
gavest men, every night and all, the 
fire will bum thee to the bare bone, 
and Christ recieve thy soul.” Was 
that really where I was, in a real 
Hell, where justice was meted out 
to the ungodly? 

Scary. It would mean that there 
was a real God, and maybe Jonah 
was swallowed by a whale in the 
Mediterranean Sea, and Joshua ben 
Nun stopped the Earth’s rotation for 
trivial purposes. 

There was something leaning 
against a rock. At first I couldn’t 
make it out: a pink mound with hair 
trailing down one side. We got 
closer and the mound became five 
hundred odd pounds of woman sit- 
ting cross-legged in stinking mud. 
A swarm of gnats hummed around 
her. She didn’t bother to swat them. 

15 




She looked up at us with lifeless 
eyes. Benito took my arm to huny 
me on past her, but I shook him 
off. She couldn’t be quite sane 
either, but she might be able to tell 
me something straight. It was more 
than he could do, and I needed 
help. 

I squatted down to look into her 
face. 

She was pathetic, hardly in shape 
to help anyone, including herself. 
Far back within tunnels of fat were 
tiny sparks of life, dull grey against 
black. Hopeless eyes, almost life- 
less. 

Her voice was a husky whisper. 
“Well?” 

“I don’t know where I am. I just 
got here and I have to know. Can 
you help me?” 

“Help you ! I died, and then this 
happened to me!” 

“Died.” 

“How else do you get into 
Hell?” Her voice rose to demand 
attention despite my shocked sur- 
prise. The full force of her breath 
washed over me in waves. “What 
did I do? I don’t deserve this! I 
don’t belong here at all,” she 
wailed. “I was beautiful. I could 
eat like a horse and bum it off in an 
hour. Then I woke up here, like 
this ! ’ ’ Her voice dropped to a low, 
confidential murmur. “We’re in the 
hands of infinite power and infinite 
sadism.” 

I shied back. Another one. 

“Is there nothing you can do?” 
Benito asked her. 

“Sure. I can chase banners to 
keep slim. What’s the point of that? 
They won’t let you do anything 
meaningful.” 

I shuddered. It could have been 



me. “Why would anyone do this to 
you?” 

“I. .think it must have been be- 
cause ten million fat people were 
cursing me.” Her voice turned ven- 
omous. “Fat, fat, fat people with 
no will power and no self-respect.” 

“Why?” 

“For doing my job! For trying to 
help people, trying to save them 
from themselves! For banning cyc- 
lamates, that’s why! It was for their 
own good,” she ranted. “You can’t 
trust people to be moderate about 
anything. Some people get sick on 
cyclamates. They have to be 
helped. And this is what I get for 
helping them!” 

“We’re trying to escape. Want to 
come with us? Benito thinks we can 
get out by going down to the center 
of this crazy place.” 

A little spark of interest flared in 
her eyes, and I held my breath. My 
open mouth had sent me floating 
down the side of a building; when 
would I learn to keep it closed? If 
she came with us we’d never get 
away. What good was she? 

She struggled to get up, then col- 
lapsed against her rock. “No, thank 
you.” 

“Right.” I started to say some- 
thing else in parting, but what? If 
anything went at all right, I’d never 
see her again. I just walked away 
and she let her head slump back 
into the mounds of fat that bulged 
at her neck. 

As we walked away, Benito 
asked, “What are cyclamates?” 

I slapped at a gnat. The gnats 
were everywhere, stinging us both, 
but Benito didn’t bother to slap at 
them. “Sugar sutstitute. For people 
who want to lose weight.”

GALAXY 




He frowned. “If there is too 
much to eat, surely it would be bet- 
ter to eat less and share with those 
who have none.” 

I looked at his big paunch and 
said nothing. 

‘‘I too am in Hell,” he reminded 
me. 

“Ah. And they can do that to 
you. .” I shuddered. We were 
lucky. 

“I take it you did not agree with 
her policy?” 

“Idiots. If they’d fed as much 
sugar to the control rats as they 
gave cyclamates to the experimental 
group, they’d have killed the con- 
trols first. Instead, they doomed a 
lot of people to fat. There wasn’t a 
good substitute for cyclamates. I 
know one guy who bought up cases 
and cases of a cyclamate diet drink 
just before the ban hit. He used to 
give cases of ‘vintage Tab’ as 
Christmas presents. They were ap- 
preciated, too.” 

Benito said nothing. 

“I know a couple who used to 
drive up to Canada every so often 
just to buy cyclamates. It was a 
stupid policy.” I looked back over 
my shoulder at a shapeless pink 
mound. “Still, it seems a little ex- 
treme, what they did to her.” 

“It is not just?” 

“How can you call that justV’ I 
didn’t say anything else, bue I re- 
membered what she’d said. ‘We’re 
in the hands of infinite power and 
infinite sadism.’ 

And just who in Hell was Benito? 
A paying customer having sport? A 
damned soul like me? Or one of the 
paid crew of Infemoland? He talked 
like a religious fanatic; he seemed 
to take everything at face value. 

INFERNO 



Did I dare follow him? But what 
else could I do? One thing was cer- 
tain, if he could think that woman 
had been treated justly, he was not 
much better than a devil himself. 

Hey, Carpentier. Would an artifi- 
cial Hell have artificial devils? I 
looked at Benito more closely. He 
was partly bald. There were no 
horns on his forehead. 

We seemed to be covering a lot 
of ground, as if the effect of too 
much distance to the wall had been 
played in reverse. Suddenly we 
were part of a crowd, all streaming 
toward the river. Nobody was push- 
ing them along, but they didn’t 
seem friendly and they didn’t talk 
among themselves. Each one was 
huddled in toward himself, not 
looking where he was going. Or 
she, there were a lot of women.. 

The ferryboat captain had a long 
white beard and eyes like burning 
coals. He screamed in rage when 
anyone was slow getting aboard. 
We were pressed together on deck, 
a mass of us so tightly packed that 
we couldn’t move. 

“You again!” he’d turned his 
burning eyes on Benito. “You’ve 
come here before! Well, you won’t 
escape again!” He swung a long 
billyclub at Benito. It hit with a 
crack that I thought would break my 
guide’s skull, but it only staggered 
him. 

More people packed the decks 
until I couldn’t even see. Finally I 
felt the boat begin to move. By then 
I’d have been glad to stay behind, 
but there was no way off the boat. 

Two voices whispered intensely 
near my ear: 

“Why didn’t you stop when I 
screamed?’ ’ 

17 




“Because you startled me into 
taking my foot off the brake. At 
least I’ll never have to listen to your 
back seat driving again — ” 

“But we’re in Hell, darling. 
They’ll probably put us in a car 
with no brakes. Maybe they’ll give 
you a horn. You’ll like that.” 

“Shut up! Shut up!” 

She did, and quiet descended. No 
crowd is that quiet. It was as if no- 
body had anything to say to anyone. 

We bumped solid ground. “All 
off,” Charon shouted. “Damned 
souls! Damned forever! You cursed 
God, and now you’ll pay for it!” 
“Damn God and everyone else!” 
“Piss on you!” “Up the people!” 
“You’re mucking bastards, all of 
you, get off my foot\” “But I don’t 
belong here.” “What’d I do? Just 
tell me — ” “Damn the lot of you, I 
died a man \ ” 

We pushed and shoved and 
danced to keep our feet in the 
swarm. At least we were on the 
other side. The crowd was hurrying 
downhill, along a road that ran bet- 
ween thick, high walls. I hung 
back, hoping Benito would go with 
the rest. No such luck. The road 
turned and twisted so we couldn’t 
see what was ahead, but that was 
good because after awhile we were 
alone. 

I tried to climb the wall. It was a 
tough scramble and I kept falling 
back. After the fourth time I sat 
there below the wall and whim- 
pered. 

“Would you like help?” Benito 
asked. 

“Sure. I thought you said the 
only way out was downhill.” 

“It is, but we have time to 
explore. Try again. This time I will 

18 



lift you.” 

He practically threw me over the 
wall. He didn’t look that strong. I 
sat on top for a second and looked 
down at him. He seemed to be wait- 
ing for me to help him up. 

And now what, Carpentier? 
Fair’s fair, he helped you. Yeah, 
but why? Leave him behind, he’s 
trouble. 

But he knows things I don’t. And 
he got me out of the bottle. 

Did he? He says he poured you 
out of a bottle the size of a fifth of 
rum! Leave him. 

I didn’t get the chance to decide. 
While I thought it over, Benito be- 
gan climbing like an Alpiner, using 
tiny cracks and bumps I could 
hardly see. Pretty soon he got one 
hand on top of the wall and pulled 
himself up. He wasn’t breathing 
hard, and he didn’t say anything 
about my sitting there and watching 
instead of helping. 

I turned to look at the coun- 
tryside. After all, this Infernoland 
seemed to be modelled on Dante. A 
quarter of a century ago the Inferno 
had been a required book for a 
course in Comparative World Liter- 
ature. I’d paid as little attention to 
the book as I could get away with. I 
remembered almost nothing, but 
certainly the place had not been 
pleasant. God’s own torture 
chamber, very medieval. 

Vague images came back to me 
now: devils with pitchforks, trees 
that talked and bled, giants and cen- 
taurs, fire, snakes. .but were those 
from the authentic Infemo, or were 
they hangovers from Oz books and 
Disney cartoons? 

Never mind, Carpentier. You’re 
not going any further.

IV 



It was lovely on the other side 
of the wall. I jumped down onto 
firm ground, grassy and pleasant. 
The air was clean, as at the top of a 
mountain, with that fresh smell you 
get only after a hard backpack into 
remote country. The gnats were 
gone. We walked toward the villas, 
lovely things, square-built, the col- 
ors of stone by twilight. 

There were crowds around us. 
Men and women and children — a 
lot of children, far too many, all 
watching us with big round eyes (or 
almond eyes, Hell was thoroughly 
integrated). Adults and children 
alike were curious, but none of 
them said anything. 

They didn’t want to be near us, 
either. They shrank away as we ap- 
proached. 

It was embarrassing. 1 thought we 
must be carrying the smells of the 
Vestibule area, the fetid stench of 
roses and decay. We’d have to find 
a place to wash. 

“I think I’m going to like it 
here,” I said. 

Benito looked at me curiously, 
but he only said, “Pleasant, isn’t it? 
Here there is no punishment.” 

The word grated. Punishment im- 
plies authority, someone with more 
power and a better moral position 
than yours. I couldn’t accept that. 
We were in the hands of the Buil- 
ders, and I’d learned all about their 
moral position on the other side of 
the black river. 

But I didn’t flare up at Benito. 
Lightly I asked, “These, then, are 
the privileged customers of Hell?’ ’ 

“Yes.” Benito did not smile. 
“They never sinned. They would 

INFERNO 



have reached Heaven if they had 
known the Church.” 

“And the children?” 
“Unbaptised.” 

I’d heard that about Catholic be- 
liefs. Even in Infernoland it seemed 
a little rough on the kids. “I 
thought they got Limbo.” 

“Call it Limbo if you wish. This 
is the First Circle of Hell.” He 
paused, uncertain. “There are 
legends that say the children will be 
bom again.” 

There were as many children here 
as there were adults! As if the Buil- 
ders had gotten a discount for quan- 
tity. Hmmm. Androids? 

It might come down to a matter 
of economics. Android infants 
would be cheaper than android 
adults: smaller, fewer reflexes. 
Would it be cheaper to build an- 
droids, or to find and capture hu- 
man beings? I couldn’t know, not 
without knowing the source. 

But / was here, placed here with- 
out my consent or knowledge, by 
an unknown hand. If me, then why 
not a thousand others? A billion? 

Benito wouldn’t be much help. 
He didn’t seem to question anything 
he saw. 

Robot or human, child or adult, 
they didn’t seem unhappy. Except 
those near us. “Benito, what’s 
the matter with them?” 

“They sense that we do not be- 
long here. I come from deeper in 
Hell, and the smell of the depths is 
on my soul.” 

“But I don’t.” 

His smile was grim. “They will 
not accept you either. ’ ’ 

I wasn’t so sure of that. If I 
found a way to clean up, and dif- 
ferent clothing. .hmmm. Knock 

19 




someone on the head, steal his toga; 
why not? Well, partly because 
they’d tear me apart if they caught 
me. And partly because there was 
no privacy here. The villas, maybe. 
Or— 

I pointed upslope toward what 
might have been a domed 
planetarium: the nearest building in 
sight of us. “What’s that?” 

“He looked. “I have never seen 
it before.” 

“Come on.” 

He came, but reluctantly. “We 
might not be permitted entry. That 
is a public building, but we are not 
of the appropriate public.” 

“We — ” I stopped because a 
white-bearded patriarch swathed in 
purple-bordered white bedsheets had 
grasped me roughly by the arm. He 
asked a rude question in gibberish. 

“Go peddle your papers,” I in- 
formed him. 

He frowned. “Recent English? 1 
asked of you why you invade a 
place not meant for you.” 

“I’m taking a survey. Are you 
happy here? Do the arrangements 
satisfy you?” 

He snorted. “No.” 

“Then,” asked Benito, “why not 
leave? There is a way out.” 

The bearded man looked him 
over, while several passersby stop- 
ped to listen. He said, “In what di- 
rection does it lie?” 

“Downslope. One must travel all 
the way to the center. To know evil 
is one path to knowing good.” 

It was lousy dialogue. The 
bearded man thought so too. “I do 
not question your knowledge of the 
depths of Hell,” he said pointedly. 
“I think you lie.” 

“Why would I? We plan to leave 

20 



Hell — ” Benito was interrupted by 
raucous laughter. A crowd was 
gathering and it wasn’t friendly. 

“You can all leave.” Benito 
seemed deadly serious. “Come with 
me, deeper and deeper into Hell. 
Leam to hate evil — ” 

“Hatred for salvation?” one of 
the oldsters asked. “A curious route 
to salvation.” 

Benito seemed to know him. 
“Yet, Epictatus, that is what you 
must leam. Not to hate men, but to 
hate their sins. And that you cannot 
do moderately. You know the truth, 
now. You know that reason alone is 
not enough. You must ask for 
grace. .” 

— I slipped out during the ser- 
mon. They were standing there po- 
litely waiting for him to finish. 
What might have been a mob scene 
had become a formal debate. 

How long would that last? Benito 
was pushing them in a direction 
they wouldn’t even consider, and 
they didn’t like him at all. They’d 
looked at me the same way: candid 
contempt, and the high bitter flavor 
of mockery. They wanted out, and 
they didn’t believe there was any 
way out, and they were damned 
well not going to listen long to a 
man they thought didn’t belong with 
them. 

Benito was preaching hatred, and 
they hated him. He should have had 
more sense. Like me. 

The dome: it couldn’t be a 
planetarium. There was no sky 
here. Conceivably it was a bath- 
house where I could wash off the 
stench, and possibly find an un- 
guarded toga. I climbed toward it. 

There were no guards. I walked 
between Doric pillars, up black 

GALAXY 




marble steps to an expanse of black 
marble floor. Half a dozen people 
were talking in a circle. They 
seemed lost in distance, but as far 
away as I was, when they caught 
sight of me they turned their backs 
firmly and continued talking. 

The language wasn’t familiar at 
all. 

The place was as empty as any- 
thing I’d seen since I left the area 
of the bottles. Six rude sons of 
bitches, and a thing in the center of 
the black marble floor. It might 
have been a sculpture, it might have 
been a machine. A thick silver ring 
twelve feet tall, standing on edge, 
and a control board at its base. 

The console looked operational. 
There were labels, in English. A 
switch (marked ON, OFF), a joy- 
stick, and a notch with a knob in it. 
The notch ran the whole length of 
the console. 

I tried the joystick. It went in all 
six directions: left, right, forward, 
back, push down, pull up. When I 
used the switch the space within the 
ring clouded, then became starry 
space. 

It was a planetarium. 

When I pushed on the joystick 
nothing happened. 

I took a closer look at the mark- 
ings along the notch. They were 
logarhythmic, labelled in Parsecs/ 
Second. The knob was all the way 
to the left. 

I moved it hard right and tried 
the joystick again. 

llie universe came up and hit me 
in the face. Whoosh! Stars shot past 
and around me; a sun came at me 
and exploded into a fraction of a 
second of intolerable brightness and 
was gone. And I was flat on my 

INFERNO 



back a couple of yards from the 
console. 

That was some planetarium! 

The half-a-dozen natives were 
watching me with some amusement. 
Screw ’em. I went back to the con- 
sole, moved the knob down to one 
parsec/second, then to a tenth of 
that. Tried the joystick. 

This time the motion was just 
obvious. I steered toward a blue- 
white star; moved the knob to slow 
as I approached it. Moved into it. 

The brightness should have 
burned my eyes out. It wasn’t even 
painful. Odd. 

I went through the center of the 
star (X-ray blue) and came out the 
other side (tremendous promi- 
nences leaping out ahead of me) 
and into space. What now? Find a 
planet? A different star? Stars were 
easier to find in this sparkling emp- 
tiness, but I’d love to dive into an 
Earthlike world. To search out the 
layers of it, to see the glowing 
nickel-iron heart. Let’s see, that 
not-too-brilliant white fleck could 
be a yellow dwarf. I moved the 
knob — 

A large hand fell heavily on my 
shoulder. 

I twitched like a man electro- 
cuted. I turned, and there was the 
mob scene I thought I’d left behind 
me: fifty-odd large, heavy men sur- 
rounding me and Benito and the 
Anywhere Machine. 

The white-bearded man who 
spoke English said, “You are leav- 
ing.” 

I said, “Dammit! Why? Nobody 
else is using the damn machine. 
I’ve waited all my life for some- 
thing like this!” 

“We do not want you here,” he 

21 




said. “We waited because we 
hoped a messenger of the gods 
would come to remove you. We 
might have asked him questions 
. .but we have tolerated you too 
long. As for the machine — ” One 
side of his mouth twitched upward. 
“If you can carry it you may take it 
with you.” 

I cursed him. I stopped when his 
wide-shouldered friends converged. 
Several of them wore armor! They 
moved away in a tight circle with 
Benito and me in the center. 

1 whispered, “Benito, can’t you 
stop them?” 

He looked at me. “How?” 

Yeah. 

But if I’d known what waited be- 
low, I’d have fought them. 



V 

Even while they marched us 
toward the wall Benito never gave 
up. 

“You may leave this place!” he 
shouted. “Hector! Aeneas! You are 
not cowards, to stay where it is 
pleasant when there is everything to 
gain elsewhere! Come with us!” 

They ignored him. 

They were compact and tough in- 
side their armor: too tough to fight, 
even if they were men, which I 
doubted. Hector, Aeneas: I knew 
the names. I remembered the Abe 
Lincoln robot at Disneyland. Could 
the armor be part of them? With in- 
spection plates — 

“Where is Virgil?” Benito 
raved. “He is no longer here, is he? 
And the Emperor Trajan?” 

“We had our chance,” said the 

22 



taller, broader one. “We didn’t take 
it. There will be no other.” 

“Have none come here since?” 
Benito demanded. 

The soldiers barked bitter laugh- 
ter. “Many.” 

“Is it reasonable to suppose that 
they will never have an opportunity 
to leave?” 

We had come to the wall. “We’ll 
think about it,” one said. “Now 
out with you. Go where you be- 
long.” The gate slammed shut be- 
hind us. 

I went for the wall on the other 
side. I examined it without joy. The 
footholds Benito had used would 
better have fitted a spider. 

Benito watched with a wry smile. 
“You never give up, do you?” 

“No.” 

“Perserverence is commendable. 
You will need it, but you must de- 
velop other virtues, such as pru- 
dence. What will happen if you en- 
tet the First Circle again?” 

“Maybe they won’t catch us this 
time. I won’t go near anyone until 
I’ve changed clothes and taken a 
bath.” 

“Do not tempt the angels,” Be- 
nito said. He was quite serious. 
Yeah, and why not? I was expect- 
ing devils in Infemoland. Why not 
angels? 

“That messenger they hoped to 
see. They wanted him to come.” 

“They did, yes. But we are fugi- 
tives, Allen.” 

There were no handholds. This 
time Benito wouldn’t help. I was 
still trying to climb the wall when a 
flash flood of people spilled into the 
far end of the alley. As they foamed 
toward us in dreadful silence I made 
one last attempt to go up the wall. 

GALAXY 




Then they swept us up and floated 
us away. 

We were in a marble palace. It 
was enormous, without furniture. 
The walls were covered with fres- 
coes of bulls and dolphins and 
pretty girls wearing flounced skirts 
and little jackets that opened in 
front to show bare breasts. The 
palace was lit with torches in 
bronze holders along the walls, and 
there wasn’t any sign of modern 
technology at all. 

Except for the palace itself. It 
wound on and on, chamber after 
chamber, huge staircases with great 
pillars inscribed in languages I 
couldn’t read. It was too big; it 
must have been prestressed concrete 
or something better. I would have 
liked to stay and look around, but 
we were embedded in the flow of 
the crowd. Nobody spoke or paid us 
any attention. I was glad for Be- 
nito’s company. Crowds of stran- 
gers bug me, and this one was 
worse than New York commuters, 
everyone wrapped up in himself. 

We spilled into an enormous 
room open at the far end. I had a 
good view through the pillars. The 
ground sloped sharply away into the 
bleakest landscape I’d ever seen. 
The castle was perched on the side 
of an enormous bowl, a world-sized 
bowl. Far down into it were the 
glimmers of fires and the shadow of 
smoke. I couldn’t see far into the 
smog that hung over everything. 

There was a throne at the far end 
of the audience chamber. An alien 
occupied it. He was vaguely 
bovine, but I’d have taken him for 
an oversized man if it hadn’t been 
for his tail. 

INFERNO 



Tail! 

“What is that?” I demanded. 

“Minos. Judge of the Dead,” 
said Benito. 

The Builders had mixed some 
Egyptian or Cretan mythology with 
their Christianity. That, or they’d 
had to warp their landscape to fit a 
genuine alien. I could believe a 
cropping beast becoming an intelli- 
gent biped, given time and impetus 
and perhaps an assist from biologi- 
cal engineers. I’d written stories 
about that kind of thing. 

Could Minos be one of the Buil- 
ders? 

People went up to present them- 
selves to the monster. I couldn’t 
hear what the girl in the yellow 
dress was telling it, but it grinned 
and nodded. Abruptly its tail looped 
out and wrapped around and around 
the girl. It lifted her. 

The tail stretched like the limbs 
of Plastic Man in the old comic 
books. The girl shot between two 
pillars and dwindled, dwindled, 
dwindled to a speck. Minos’ tail 
must have been tens of miles long 
at that point. It came snaking back 
through the air, while the speck that 
was the girl sank like a single 
snowflake. 

My willing suspension of disbe- 
lief went all to hell. I started to 
giggle hysterically. 

Nobody noticed. Nobody but Be- 
nito, who watched curiously as I 
gathered the shreds of my self con- 
trol, took him by the arm, pointed 
at ‘Minos’ and said, “He can’t do 
that!” 

He was doing it again !The tail 
stretched out between the pillars 
like an infinite length of snake, 
dropped a man in a postman’s uni- 

23 




form into the murky air and came 
coiling back. 

But there wasn’t room! Even ig- 
noring the moment arm — that much 
weight at the end of that much 
length should have toppled him, and 
how could such a length of tail, 
flexible tail, be strong enough to 
stay almost straight? But ignore 
that, and tell me where there was 
room for tens of miles of tail to be 
coiled inside his body? 

His feet weren’t anchored; I 
watched until I saw them both 
move. The tail wasn’t stored in the 
floot, then. 

“Are you all right?’’ Benito 
asked. 

My vision was greying out; my 
whole body had a buzzing foot’s- 
asleep feeling. 1 said, “I’m going to 
faint.” 

“You can’t faint here. Hold 
fast.” His hand gripped my shoul- 
der. 

A dark-haired woman, quite pret- 
ty, was encoiled in the tail until she 
nearly vanished, was lifted and sent 
spinning off down the bowl. A man 
in a cabbie’s uniform was next. 
Three loops of tail and out he went 
into space. And another, and 
another — 

There were thousands here. We’d 
starve before we reached our turn. 

But I didn’t feel hungry, and 
hadn’t felt hungry since I left the 
bottle, and that was hours ago. Al- 
so, something was wrong with time. 
“Minos” was in no hurry. Quite 
the opposite. He took plenty of time 
to deal with each case, and there 
were plenty of cases; yet the crowd 
thinned out much faster than it 
should have. 

Where were they going? I never 

24 



saw anyone leave the room, but 
there had to be other audience 
chambers, people slipping off into 
side passages. There must have 
been hundreds, perhaps thousands, 
of copies of “Minos”. 

Ridiculous mummery. But the 
tail, Carpentier! Hidden in 
hyperspace, or snaking out of an al- 
ternate time track? If the Builders 
have that kind of technology, how 
long were you dead? Ten thousand 
years? A million? 

It was our turn. We approached 
together. Not many had come up in 
pairs. 

“Sodomites, huh?” Minos said. 
“Seventh Circle, Third Level. Or 
have you got something worse to 
confess?” 

I said, “I refuse to answer on 
grounds that my — ” 

He looked a lot like an angry bull 
when he frowned, and nothing at all 
like a machine. He turned to Be- 
nito. “You’ve been here before. 
Why have you left your proper 
place?” 

“Is that your affair? You see I 
roam freely through Hell.” 

“Yes. How?” 

“It has been willed that I may do 
so. You have no right to interfere.” 

Minos waved at me. “And this 
one?” 

“He has come from the Ves- 
tibule,” Minos said. “You will 
note that he comes of his own ac- 
cord. You may not judge him.” 

“Lawyers.” Minos laughed. “I 
have problems with lawyers. There 
are so many places appropriate to 
that breed. Where are you two go- 
ing, then?” 

“Down.” 

“Back to the First Circle.” 



GALAXY 




We’d spoken simultaneously. 
Minos laughed. ‘‘Back you will not 
go. Are you sure you don’t want 
me to judge you, Allen Carpenter? 
My judgement is just and fair. You 
could choose worse for yourself 
than justice.” 

‘‘Cease!” Benito commanded. I 
jumped. He was a changed man. 
Power seemed to gather around him 
as he struck a pose, massive chin 
jutting out in defiance, his face both 
calm and stem. Once upon a time 
he had been used to obedience. 

“I am permitted to judge. .” 
Suddenly Minos sounded petulant. 

“You have already judged me. 
What other power have you? And 
this man is not under your jurisdic- 
tion. Leave us alone to go in 
peace.” 

“Not back up.” 

“No. Down.” 

Minos laughed. He waved toward 
the steps leading down into the 
bowl from his throne. “Depart. 
Thou art sent!” He was still laugh- 
ing as we started down those steps, 
the mocking laughter in our ears un- 
til we lost sight of the palace. 



VI 

We WERE ALL RIGHT as long as 
the steps continued. Unfortunately 
they soon trailed away into a broken 
slope that still dropped at forty-five 
degrees or so. At the same time a 
wind began to rise. Benito and I 
turned to face the slope and backed 
down on toes and knees and hands. 

In fact, the hurricane in my head 
(Where does the Minos-thing keep 
its tail? What is Benito, that he 
gives orders to an inhuman that 

INFERNO 



judges all others who come before 
it? Is this Hell for a science fiction 
writer, where physical laws are 
whimsical and puzzles have no 
answers?) was nothing compared to 
the hurricane we were backing into. 
We moved flat against the slope, 
clutching at the rock and digging 
into the dirt for footholds. 

Benito yelled, “Minos called you 
Carpenter. Not Carpentier.” 

I’d been wondering how the 
monster knew. “I was bom Car- 
penter,” I shouted down at Benito 
“I added the i to make the name 
more interesting, easier to re- 
member. I wrote under Carpentier.” 
And when I talked to myself (I 
didn’t add) it was Carpentier I 
talked to. I’d started that in an ef- 
fort to memorize the new pronuncia- 
tion. 

We’d backed onto a broad ledge. 
I stayed flat as I looked around. 

Someone was dancing to the 
music of the howling wind. 

He was bones and paunch and 
long flying hair just greying un- 
evenly at the temples. He jumped 
and danced and flapped his arms 
like a bird, grim determination on 
his homely face. 

I hollered into the wind. “Hey, 
friend — ” 

He didn’t wait for the question. 
“If I could just get off the 
ground!” he wailed. “The guy in 
the helmet’s got a dozenV' 

Hey, yeah, I’d been right the first 
time! It was a futuristic looney bin 
geared for psychodrama on the 
grand scale! Let them work out 
their delusions here, and maybe 
they’d be fit for whatever unim- 
aginable society they’d flunked out 
of. And I had answers to all the 

25 




questions, in that wonderful mo- 
ment before I followed his eyes 
upward. 

The air was full of flying people. 

They weren’t exactly guiding 
their flight. The wind had them. 
Here it churned them in a momen- 
tary funnel, then flung them out- 
ward. There they came in a straight 
blast; it hit a shoulder of the moun- 
tain and churned the trapped beings 
into eddy currents. The people flew 
like Kleenex in a hurricane, but 
they looked like people, and they 
howled like Kansans caught outside 
in a flash tornado. 

Most of them were flying in 
man-and-woman pairs. But, yeah, 
there was one guy surrounded by a 
good dozen girls, all in a whirling 
clump at the top of a rising air col- 
umn. 

The bony guy on the ledge ran 
off flapping his arms. There were 
others along the base, men and 
women, all trying to fly. I had dif- 
ferent ideas. I gripped the rock hard 
and stayed flat. 

“The Carnal,” Benito screamed 
into the wind. “Those who warped 
all that mattered in their lives for 
lust. I imagine those at the base of 
the cliff were unsuccessful lovers. 
We will be in less danger on the 
next ledge.” He started crawling. 

‘‘Benito! That’s it!” I cried. 
“We’ll fly out of here!” 

He turned in astonishment. It was 
a mistake. The wind slipped under 
his raised shoulders and lifted him 
and flung him at me. 

I got him by the ankle. He nearly 
tore me loose, but I had a handhold 
in a split rock and I hung on. He 
doubled on his own length and pul- 
led himself down my forearm until 

26 



he was flat to the ground again. 
“Thank you,” he bellowed. 
“S’okay. I wish you could have 
seen your expression.” I was rather 
pleased with myself, as if I’d man- 
aged to catch a glass somebody’s 
elbow had knocked off a table. 
Good reflexes, Carpentier! 

“We’ll fly out of here,” I 
screamed happily into his ear. 
“We’ll fly over the wall. We’ll 
build a glider!” 

“I was stubborn too, once. 
Perhaps I still am. Is this really 
your wish, Allen?” 

“Damn right. We’ll build a 
glider. Listen, if we’re light enough 
to be blown away by the first wind, 
we probably won’t need much more 
than a big late! Hey, let’s get out of 
this wind and talk it over.” 

We crawled. 

The weather changed as we 
lost altitude. It didn’t get any better. 
The wind died down; we didn’t 
need to clutch at the rocks, and we 
could hear ourselves speak. But a 
freezing drizzle started. 

Now that I was thinking glider, 
the loss in altitude bothered me. 
“We need a place to build it,” I 
said. “Out of the wind. We need 
fabric, a lot of fabric, and we need 
wood. We probably need tools.” 
Benito nodded. “There is a 
place, a great swamp, the Styx. 
Trees grow there. As for the fabric 
and the tools, we can cross Styx 
and get them from the wall.” 

“How many walls have you got 
here?” 

Benito smiled grimly. “None like 
this one ahead. Red hot iron.” 

I believed him. Nothing subtle 
about Infemoland. “How far down 



GALAXY 




is it? We’re losing altitude with ev- 
ery step.” . 

‘‘A good distance yet.” Benito 
laughed. “A glider. You may be 
the first ever to think of that. If we 
can launch from the hill above 
Styx, we can use the thermal up- 
draft above the red hot walls. 
Ecch,” he said, about the time I 
stepped backward into freezing 
slush. 

We’d reached another level re- 
gion. I stood up and looked around. 
Freezing muck in all directions. 
Human beings lay full length in it, 
like half-immersed logs. The rain 
was turning to sleet. Cold garbage 
washed against my ankles. 

“Behold the low rent district,” I 
said. 

I got a chuckle from Benito. 
“Not yet,” he said; and if I hadn’t 
had the shivers before I got them 
then. He swept his arm about him 
and said, “The Gluttonous.” 

“I don’t want to know. Come 
on, let’s get through this.” 

We waded out into it. 

In the darkness, and half-blinded 
by sleet, I managed not to step on 
any half-buried victims. Some 
raised their heads to watch us pass, 
showing us uniform looks of weary 
despair; then sank back after we 
were gone. 

Men and women in about equal 
numbers, they ranged from pleas- 
antly plump to chubby to gross. 
Three or four were as bad as the 
woman in the Vestibule. I won- 
dered if they’d be pleased to know 
about her. 

And once I wiped frozen slush 
from my eyes, cursing imagina- 
tively under my breath, and when I 
dropped my hand he was staring at 

INFERNO 



me: a long-haired blond man built 
like an Olympics athlete. 

“Allen Carpentier,” he said sad- 
ly. “So they got you too.” 

I looked close and recognized 
him. “Petri? Jan Petri! What are 
you doing here? You’re no glut- 
ton!” 

“I’m the least gluttonous man 
who ever lived,” he said bitterly. 
“While all of these creeps were 
swilling down anything that came 
near their mouths, from pig meat to 
garden snails — and you too, for that 
matter, Allen — I was taking care of 
myself. Natural foods- Organic veg- 
etables. No meat. No chemicals. I 
didn’t drink. I didn’t smoke. I 
didn’t — ” He caught himself up. “I 
didn’t hire you as my lawyer. Why 
am I bending your ear? You’re here 
too. You were one of the PIGS, 
weren’t you?” 

“Yeah.’’’ He meant the Prestigi- 
ous International Gourmand Socie- 
ty, whose purpose in life was to go 
out and eat together. I’d joined be- 
cause I liked the company. “But 
I’m not staying here. TTiis isn’t my 
slot.” 

He wiped slush from his face to 
see me better. “So where are you 
going?” 

“Out of this place. Come 
along?” He’d be unpleasant com- 
pany till we got him a bath, but I 
knew he wouldn’t slow us^ down.' 
There never was a health nut to 
match Petri. He used to run ten 
miles a day. I figured he’d be a lot 
of help building the glider. 

“How do you get out of Hell?” 

So they’d convinced him too. 
“We go downhill for awhile. Then 
we’ll—” 

He was shaking his head. “Don’t 

27 




go down. I’ve heard about some of 
tbe places downhill. Red hot coffins 
and devijs and you name it.” 

‘‘We’re not going very far. 
We’re going to build a glider and 
go over the walls. ’ ’ 

“Yeah? And then where?” He 
seemed to think it was funny. 
“You’ll just get yourself in more 
trouble, and for what? You’re better 
off if you just take what they give 
you, no matter how unfair it is.” 
“Unfair?” Benitt asked. 

Petri’s head snapped around. 
“Hell yes, unfair! I’m no glutton!” 
Benito shook his head, very sad- 
ly. “Gluttony is too much attention 
to the things of the earth, especially 
in the matter of diet. It is the obses- 
sion that matters, not the quantity.” 
Petri stared a moment. Wearily 
he said, “Bug off,” and sank back 
into the freezing muck. As we left 
him I could hear him muttering. 
“At least I’m not fat like those ani- 
mals. I take care of myself. 

I was annoyed with Benito. 
“You didn’t have to insult him. We 
could use his muscles. Hey — ” 
Benito heard the panic in my voi- 
ce. “Yes?” 

“I was at Petri’s funeral! All that 
attention to his health, and then he 
got caught in the Watts riots. But 
•hey damn sure didn’t freeze him! 
They cremated him!” 

“Freeze him?” 

I didn’t bother to explain. They’d 
cremated Petri, burned him to ash 
and gasses. How could he have 
been revived? How could the Buil- 
ders of this Infernoland even have 
found specs for a robot analogue? 
Or a cell for cloning? Or. .any- 
thing? Cremated is as dead as you 
c an get! 

28 



Do the Builders have a time cam- 
era? Physical principles unknown, 
but to re-create Petri they have to 
be able to photograph the past. So 
we give them that, and the space- 
warping fields, and the genetic en- 
gineering that created Minos and 
freed Carpentier from the need to 
eat or drink or sleep, and the 
weather control, and the reduced 
mass of people in the winds, and 
the engineering technology that built 
Infernoland itself. 

Carpentier, if they’ re that power- 
ful, do you really want to fight 
them? 

Of course not. I only want out ! 

“You’re very thoughtful,” said 
Benito. “Watch your step.” 

I stopped at the brink of a pre- 
cipice. Then I followed Benito 
down a wandering, dangerous trail. 
It switchbacked along the face of 
the cliff and in many places it 
would have been easy to go over 
the edge. That scared me a lot. Af- 
ter all, I’d done it before. 

At least we were going down on 
our feet, and the sleet had stopped. 

Things were definitely looking 
up. 

Still, there were funny noises 
from the gloomy area below, 
sounds my mind registered as con- 
struction work. Crash. A long 
pause, in which voices screamed 
orders too distant to make out. 

Crash. 



VII 

The trail led out onto a flat 
plain of hard baked clay. As we 
reached the bottom Benito stopped 
me silently, with an arm held 

GALAXY 




straight out across my chest. I was 
willing. I had heard the rumble and 
the shouting coming toward us. 

It rolled past us at a good clip: a 
boulder four or five yards across, 
nearly spherical, bounding across 
the cracked adobe, surrounded by a 
shouting mob. They were urging it 
along, running alongside and but- 
ting the mass with their heads and 
shoulders, a mob of men and wo- 
men dressed in the finest rags I’d 
ever seen. There were the remains 
of evening gowns and slashed vel- 
vet Restoration clothing, academic 
robes and Gernrich original crea- 
tions, all torn and filthy. 

The leader wore striped trousers 
and swallow-tail coat and a ring that 
would have choked a hippopotamus. 
“This time!” he screamed at the 
top of his voice. “This time 
we’ll. .get them!” 

“We can pass now,” Benito said 
calmly. 

“What was that all about?” 

CRACK! 

I looked to my left. Two nearly 
identical masses of pale blue trans- 
lucent stone stood rocking back and 
forth. Eighty or ninety humans in 
decaying opulence lay about the 
rocks as if they’d been flung in 
handfuls. 

A few started to get up. The 
leader shook his fist and screamed, 
“Hoarders! Misers! Next time — 
Come on, men, we need a bigger 
lead time!” More got up, shaking 
their heads dazedly, and two groups 
attacked the two huge stones and 
began painfully rolling them in op- 
posite directions. The other outfit, 
the one furthest away, was dressed 
differently: also in rags, but these 
had never been much to start with. 



“Hoarders and Wasters,” said 
Benito. “Natural enemies. They 
will try to crush each other with 
those rocks for all eternity.” 

“Benito, I’d swear those 
rocks. .” 

“Yes?” 

“Skip it. I’m getting so I’ll be- 
lieve anything.” We started across 
the plain. A couple of hundred 
yards ahead of us was a hedgerow 
of some kind, and sounds filtered 
through it. The misers were rolling 
their rock back that way, getting 
good distance for another run. We 
followed until they reached the 
hedges and stopped. Then they 
turned to, pushing it the other way. 
A prim-looking bearded man in the 
remains of a dark suit from the 
1890’s shouted toward the other 
mob. “You threw away the good in 
your lives! Now pay!” 

I couldn’t stand it any longer. I 
grabbed a wild-eyed matron by the 
shoulder. She struggled to get 
away. “Let me go! We have to 
crush those wasteful — ” 

“Ever manage to do it?” 

“No.” 

“Think you will this time?” 

“We might!” 

“Yeah, sure,” I said. “What 
would happen if you stopped rolling 
the rock and took a break?” 

She studied my face for signs of 
Mongoloid idiocy. “They’d cream 
us.” 

“Suppose you both stopped?” 

She pulled away from me and ran 
to put her shoulder to the boulder. 
The mob heaved it over a bump. 
She shouted back to me. “We 
couldn’t trust them. Even if we 
could. .we can’t stop. Minos 
might. .” 



INFERNO 



29 




“Might take it away,” I guessed. 
“I thought I knew that color.” 

Several of them glanced at me 
suspiciously. A couple of the men 
left the rock to advance on me. 

“Hey! Hold on! I couldn’t steal it 
by myself. I don’t want to.” 

They relaxed. One, a man wear- 
ing the remains of a peasant smock, 
said, “Many of us hae been here 
for unco time. Yon Queen Ar- 
temesia says when first she came, 
there were still facets upon’t. It 
must hae been a bonny sight.” He 
sighed wistfully. 

It must hae been, yeah. Hey, 
Carpentier, how long would it take 
to wear all the corners off a twelve 
foot diamond? I turned back toward 
Benito. He was talking to someone 
on the ground. 

It was a man with both legs 
crushed. The rock must have rolled 
over him. He was still in shock, be- 
cause he wasn’t screaming in pain, 
but he would be. Blood seeped 
from the jellied mess that had been 
his legs. 

“For pity’s sake,” he said, “pull 
me out of the way. Maybe they 
won’t get me a few times, and then 
I’ll be able to keep away from 
them — ” 

He’d had it. Mind gone with his 
body. It was just as well. We ought 
to be taking him to a hospital, but 
why bother? He’d haif it. 

“We are leaving Hell,” Benito 
said. “First we go down — ” 

“Oh no! I know what they do to 
you down there! Just move me, just 
a little, please?” 

I wondered where to put him. 
The ledge was hard and flat, baked 
adobe, with no cover between the 
cliff and the hedgerow. But we 

30 



couldn’t leave him out here. I took 
him under the arms and dragged 
him over against the cliff to die in 
peace. 

“I thank you,” he whispered. 
“What’s your name?” 

“Allen Carpentier.” 

He seemed to brighten. “I had all 
your books.” 

“Hey! Did you?” Suddenly I 
liked this man. 

“Too bad I don’t have my collec- 
tion. I could get your autograph on 
them. I had. .all of everyone’s 
books. Did you ever hear of my 
collection? Allister Toomey?” 

“Sure.” I’d known many book 
collectors, and they’d all heard of 
Allister Toomey, to their rage and 
sorrow. Toomey had spent a con- 
siderable inheritance on books, all 
kinds of books, from double four- 
edges to first editions to pulps and 
comic books that were just getting 
to be worth owning. Much of what 
he had owned had been unique, ir- 
replaceable. He’d kept them all in a 
huge barn he’d managed to hang 
onto somehow. 

He’d spent everything else on 
books: there was no money left to 
take care of them. They mouldered 
in that barn. Rats and insects got 
into them, rain dripped through the 
roof. If he’d sold a few of them 
he’d have been able to take care of 
the rest. I’d known a lot of collec- 
tors, and they all had a tendency to 
brood over Allister Toomey. 

“I guess I don’t have to ask why 
you’re here.” 

“No. I was both a. .hoarder 
and a waster. I lay between both 
groups. .1 suppose it’s fair 
enough. I wish I’d taken. .one or 
another of those offers. But what 



GALAXY 




could I sell?” 

I nodded and turned away. He 
continued talking, to himself now. 
“Not the complete Analog collec- 
tion. Not the Alice in Wonderland. 
It was autographed. Autographed!” 

Goodby Allister Toomey, who’d 
died twice now. I waited with Be- 
nito until the mob swarmed past 
with their bouncing boulder, then 
we ran across. 

CRACK! 

We found a hole in the hedgerow 
and scrambled through. 

There was only a narrow ledge 
beyond the hedgerow, then a cliff. 
Thick mists hid the bottom, but it 
was a long way down. There didn’t 
look to be any way over it. 

We walked along for miles. 
There were other groups behind the 
hedgerow (CRACK!) all shouting 
and screaming (CRACK!) in various 
languages. 

Then the sounds changed. 
Machinery, rivet guns, hammers 
ringing, the sounds of workmen and 
their tools. 

Tools! We’d need tools for the 
glider. I began to run ahead. 

A TREMENDOUS CHUNK of the 
ledge had collapsed, and the chasm 
ran right across, from the cliff on 
the downhill side to the base of the 
cliff towering above. A stream ran 
through it and it had cut the gorge 
even deeper. Far below we could 
see people working frantically on a 
dam. 

Another group was just as franti- 
cally tearing it down. 

. At our own level there was a 
similar contest. One group was try- 
In g to build a bridge across the 
8° r ge, and another worked to disas- 

■NFERNO 



semble it. Fifty yards in either di- 
rection were more bridge builders 
and destroyers. It seemed like a lot 
of wasted effort. 

I looked to Benito, but he only 
shrugged. “I have never been to 
this part before. I do not think 
Dante came here either.” 

The group just in front of us were 
steelworkers, slapping together 
I-beams, girders, plates, anything 
they could manage, fastening it with 
hot rivets and hammers. A small 
forge blazed away to heat rivets. I 
looked at all the work without 
comprehension — until I saw Barbara 
Hannover. 

Suddenly it came to me. I’d 
known Barbara a long time. She 
wasn’t cruel, and she didn’t hate 
people, but she loved wildlife more. 
Whatever anyone proposed, a new 
bridge, a new freeway, housing de- 
velopement, mine, power plant, oil 
well, or wheatfield, she had a mill- 
ion reasons why you couldn’t do it. 
I honestly think she’d have let all 
the Kansas wheatfields go back to 
prairie and buffalo if she could have 
thought of a way to manage it. 

Add to her fanatic streak a Har- 
vard Law School degree and one of 
the sharpest brains in the country, 
and it was easy to see why lovers of 
progress shuddered when she took 
an interest in what they were doing. 

And naturally she was tearing die 
bridge down. I had an idea and 
looked closer at the construction 
workers. If Barbara was in this part 
of Infemoland, Pete couldn’t be far 
away. 

And there he was, bucking rivets. 
Pete and Barbara had been married 
for awhile. A short while. Just as 
she couldn’t see a housing tract 

31 




without wanting eviction writs and 
bulldozers, he couldn’t see a nice 
place on the trail without wanting to 
improve it with a log cabin. I’d 
gone hiking with him once. The 
whole fifty miles was one long de- 
velopement plan, with ideas for im- 
proving the trail, building hostels, 
constructing artificial beaver dams, 
putting in handrails where the climb 
was steep. .1 almost killed him be- 
fore we got back to the car. 

“It makes sense,” I told Benito. 
“Artistically. The way anything 
else down here makes sense. Pete 
and Barbara were both fanatics.” 

Neither of them had noticed me. 
I couldn’t see how steel-working 
tools would help anyway. But up- 
stream was a wooden trestle bridge, 
with a group just finishing it while 
another tried to get at it with saws. 

I looked at the saws and lusted. 
With a saw and nothing else we 
could build a glider. Other things 
would be useful, but they were 
easier to make than a saw would 
be. I had to have one. 

The funny thing was that they 
used each other’s tools. One guy 
would be hammering away to put a 
beam in place, and another would 
be sawing it in half — and while they 
screamed insults at each other, they 
did nothing else. The rules in Infer- 
noland were more complicated than 
I’d have thought. 

Or the robots were programmed 
funny. 

But that sure looked like Pete and 
Barbara. 

I waited until a progressive type 
laid down his saw, then started for 
it. Too late. A thin-faced woman 
grabbed it and had at the trestle- 
piece he’d been trimming to fit. 

32 



The next time I was quicker. 
When she set the saw aside for an 
ax, I grabbed it. There was a drill- 
bit on the ground next to it, just a 
twisted chunk of steel more valu- 
able than its equivalent in 
diamonds, and I got that too. 

You’d have thought they were 
diamonds. Madam Hawkface started 
for me with the ax, and her builder 
companion was right behind. He 
didn’t need an ax. He could have 
made three of me. 

“Run!” I shouted. 

Benito heard. We dashed for the 
trail leading down into the gorge. It 
was narrow and twisted, but it 
looked safer than what we were 
leaving. 

I’d done one thing. I’d got those 
two crews to cooperate for the first 
time since Infernoland was opened 
to the public. 

Unfortunately, what they wanted 
to cooperate on was tearing me to 
pieces. The trail turned a corner, 
then swooped down the cliff. We 
followed it. 



VIII 

There was a ledge ten feet be- 
low the lip of the cliff, and we 
stopped for a moment to catch our 
breaths. I thought I felt the cliff 
tremble and asked Benito about it. 

“It is not any place to stay,” he 
warned. “Allen, you will find that 
there is no safe place in Hell. 
Wherever you stop — well, you 
won’t like it.” 

“I can believe that.” The thing 
to do was get out of here, and the 
more I thought about it, the better 
the glider looked. Now I had a saw 

GALAXY 




that I could use to cut frames and 
ribs and stringers, if I could find 
anything to cut. 

I still wondered what we’d use 
for fabric, but somewhere there had 
to be a storehouse for the costumes. 
The gowns Benito and 1 wore 
would do. It was a close-woven 
fabric, very tough, and it shed most 
of the dirt and muck we’d crawled 
through. I lifted the hem and tested 
the weave by blowing through it. It 
didn’t let much through. It would 
do fine. 

The ledge heaved again. I won- 
dered if this were something for our 
benefit, then laughed at myself. 
Earthquakes on call? The Builders 
were powerful, but that powerful? 

We scrambled along the ledge un- 
til we were stopped by a waterfall 
pouring out in front of us. The wa- 
ter was black and dirty, and it stank 
like a sewer outfall, but the water 
rushed downward, and it had carved 
a bed in the cliff side. There were 
handholds in the sides of the notch 
the stream had carved. 

How long would it take a stream 
to carve that? It would depend on 
what the rock was made of. And of 
course the Builders could have 
carved the notch themselves, though 
it looked natural enough. 

After a while we reached the bot- 
tom of the cliff. The ground fell 
away at a steep angle. We found a 
path down it, along the stinking 
stream, twisting and turning along 
lower and lower, with steep cliff 
e dges in places. 

It would be an ideal place to 
launch a glider if we could get one 
U P the slope. Drag it up here and 
0Ver to one of the drop-offs, and 
P u sh. Yeah. It looked better all the 

•NFERNO 



time, but first we had to build the 
glider, and what was I going to 
build it out of? I wanted to see 
those trees. I clutched the saw clos- 
er to me. 

Benito was staring at me. I stared 
back. 

“Forgive me,” he said. “You 
hold that tool in a way I have seen 
before.” 

“Yeah?” 

“By monks riddled with self- 
doubt, and clutching a crucifix to 
reassure themselves their religion is 
true.” 

“We’ll need this. We’ll need 
other things too. Wood, and rope 
for the glider — ” 

“Will that do?” He pointed 
downward. 

We were almost at the bottom 
now. We faced a stinking swamp. 
Thick fog hid most of it, with only 
temporary glimpses through. Things 
thrashed around in the filthy water, 
but there were also bushes and trees 
hung with vines. Wood! Vines! 
Certainly I could build a glider out 
of those! “Now all we need is fab- 
ric. There must be a supply dump 
in this place. Or a laundry. Some- 
thing.” 

Benito sighed. “There is.” 

“Great! Can we get a lot of those 
gowns?” 

“It will not be easy.” 

“Easy?” I laughed. “Who cares, 
as long as we get out of here!” 

Benito’s determined look was 
very like a bulldog’s. “Very well. 
I will help you get what you need. I 
will help you build your glider. I 
will help you fly it, in whatever di- 
rection you choose. In return, you 
will promise me that if this mad 
scheme fails, you will come with 

33 




me to the real exit.” 

“Yeah, sure, sure.” 1 wasn’t re- 
ally listening. I was too interested 
in the swamp below us. 

The things bubbling around in 
there were people. Some of them 
just lay there half submerged, 
bubbling out filth and talking non- 
sense. Others fought each other, for 
what 1 couldn't make out. They 
roiled the stinking waters, washing 
up slimy things. Thick fog hung all 
around and I had only glimpses of 
anything more than a few feet 
away. 

“This way.” Benito waded out 
into the slop. He seemed to know 
what he was doing, because it 
wasn’t very deep, just to our ank- 
les. The gup squished inside my 
sandals, slimy and thoroughly un- 
pleasant. Every now and again there 
was solid ground a few inches 
above the muck. 

We picked our way through 
low-hanging trees and bushes. I 
fingered the wood and tried my saw 
on one of the trees to cut off a 
branch. It seemed strong enough 
and quite springy. I hacked off a 
chunk of vine and it was too tough 
to break. 

We could! We really could build 
a glider! 

As we got deeper into the swamp 
there were fewer people, but 1 could 
hear curses in every language I’d 
ever imagined, people screaming at 
each other, and the sounds of 
blows. Sometimes a filthy shape 
would try to climb up onto the 
ground where we walked, but others 
would grab it and pull it back into 
the mire. I shuddered. Why did 
they do that? 

“The wrathful,” Benito said. 



“And the sullen. The worst offen- 
ders in upper Hell.” He was about 
to say something else, but he ran 
into something lying on the trail and 
almost fell. 

It was a man, filthy with the 
muck, lying in foetal position. His 
eyes were open and staring at us. 
He glared, not at us, but at the uni- 
verse in general. 

“Hello,” I said. 

“Come with us,” Benito added. 
“There is a way.” He didn’t sound 
hopeful, and of course there wasn’t 
any response. “Remember there is 
a way. Downward, accepting 
everything — ” 

“Come on, he’s catatonic.” It 
bothered me, Benito preaching to a 
rubber-doll catatonic. Was my 
loony bin theory right after all? 
Psychodrama on the grand scale? 

Then why was I here? And Jan 
Petri, and Pete and Barbara? It was 
as if the Builders had revived 
everyone who had ever lived! Then 
set out to cure the crazy ones. Did 
they think I was one of those? 

There was another one on the 
trail, and he wasn’t catatonic at all. 
He stood there glaring at us, while 
others thrashed in the muck at either 
side of him. To get past we’d have 
to wade out into that, and from the 
ripples we would not only be over 
our heads, but among the fighters. 
They’d never let us out. 

“Excuse us,” Benito said pleas- 
antly. “The trail is wide enough for 
us to pass if you will step forward 
two paces.” 

“Bugger off.” 

“Surely you will not stand in our 
way?” Benito was still very pleas- 
ant, but there was an edge to his 
voice. 



34 



GALAXY 




“Took me a hundred years to get 
up here,” the figure said. “You 
never have been in the muck. If it’s 
good enough for me, it’s good 
enough for you.” 

He was a big man with powerful 
arms and he seemed to mean it. 

“Stand aside,” Benito said. He 
was giving orders now. “You may 
come with us if you will — and if 
you can, which I doubt. But you 
will not prevent us from going.” 
Benito’s voice still had the ring of 
authority that had cowed Minos, 
and it shook the guy momentarily. 

“Don’t I know you?” he said. 
He stared at Benito. “I’m sure 1 
know you. Well, whoever the hell 
you are, get past me the same way I 
got up here.” 

“Friend, you leave us no 
choice,” Benito said. 

“Aha! 1 do know you! You’re 
Ben — Hey! Let go! Hey!” 

Benito grasped him by the shoul- 
ders and lifted him as easily as I 
would a child. I gaped as Benito 
flung him out into the marsh. He 
wasn’t even breathing hard. 
“Come, Allen.” 

“Yeab. Sure.” I followed num- 
bly, wondering who Benito really 
was. A professional wrestler? Cir- 
cus strong man? What he’d done 
wasn’t impossible. I’d seen it done 
before, but not often, and Benito 
didn’t look that strong. 



XI 

Eventually we got through 
the trees and brush to open water. 
There was a big black tower at the 
edge. 1 couldn’t see anyone in the 
tower, but suddenly there was a 

INFERNO 



light in the top window. It flashed, 
ruby-red, out across the marsh. 

Red? Ruby? A laser! Not magic, 
just a laser signal from an old stone 
tower. Far out in the murk over the 
water there was a flash of light, 
blinking, the same color as the sig- 
nal. 

“Phlegyas will come for us 
now,” Benito said. “You must be 
careful, Say nothing you don’t have 
to say, and as little of that as possi- 
ble. Let me handle him. 

“Sure. Why?” 

“Because we are fugitives and 
we are approaching the, ah, ad- 
ministrative centers of Hell. There 
are demons here. Guards. They can 
do terrible things to us.” 

“Can’t they just.” I’d seen 
enough atrocities already. Were the 
Builders the crazy ones? They 
seemed to like pain. 

From somewhere behind us there 
were screams of rage and agony, 
and splashing noises. I thought I 
saw ripples in the open water ahead 
of us too. 

Then something took shape in the 
gloom ahead, something moving 
toward us. 

It was a boat. A big man, 
bearded, with a low gold crown on 
his head, stood in the stern with an 
oar in the sternlock. He sculled 
slowly, but that boat moved. I al- 
most laughed. He certainly wasn’t 
putting out enough effort to get that 
kind of speed. The boat must have 
a hidden water-jet or something. 

“I have you again!” the man 
cackled. “Ah, Benito, caught 
again. Good work!” He looked at 
me closely and his grin faded. 
“Who are you?” 

1 didn’t answer. 

35 




“Were you sentenced to Lower 
Hell?” 

“Phlegyas, mind your own busi- 
ness,” Benito said. “Bring the boat 
to the s+iore. I do not care to wade 
in your filthy swamp.” 

“Don’t like cold, eh?” Phlegyas 
seemed to find that funny. “Well, 
you won’t have cold feet long, 
where you’re going! Get in, Benito, 
get in. The other one has to stay 
here, of course. I have orders con- 
cerning you, but not him.” He 
looked at me again. “You don’t 
have a pass from Minos? No pa- 
pers? You can’t come.” 

“He will come,” Benito said. 
“This has been willed where what 
is willed must be. Now bring the 
boat to shore.” 

Phlegyas shrugged. He moved the 
oar and the boat rammed the bank, 
bow first. “All right, all right, you 
have the formula.” His voice was a 
nasty whine of complaint. “It’s sure 

36 



been hell here since Dante pub- 
lished that book. You’d be surprised 
how many try that on me. Nothing I 
can do about it, either.” 

We scrambled onto the boat and 
sat gingerly. I noticed that the boat 
didn’t sink deeper by an inch. 
Didn’t we weigh anything? In that 
case we could walk on the swamp! 
But that was silly, because the 
swamp rippled and bubbled with 
people — and we’d sunk to the ank- 
les in the muck. I could smell the 
stink on my feet. 

Every now and then a nose would 
appear above the water as someone 
caught a breath, then vanished 
again. How many were there in that 
swamp? I could hear screams of 
rage and agony and pain, and curs- 
ing in all languages, but I couldn’t 
see any details in the half-light and 
the fog. 

Phlegyas sculled rapidly and the 
boat shot away from the bank. The 

GALAXY 



fog enclosed us in a circle of dark 
water rippled with shouting faces 
and with the chicken guts and other 
filth that poured down from the land 
of the Hoarders and the Wasters. 

Sometimes a filthy claw would 
reach from the water to clutch at the 
gunwhales, and then Phlegyas 
would smash it with a six foot pole 
he kept in a socket ready to hand. 
He sculled easily with one hand. 

"You know, that formula doesn’t 
work with the real supervisors,” he 
said. He reached to straighten his 
crown and gave us a sour look. 
“They took the power of decision 
away from me. 1 made a couple of 
mistakes, just a couple of lousy 
mistakes, and now they think they 
can do better than me. Over two 
thousand years of service here, and 
upstarts have more power than me. 
It isn’t fair, you know. Bastards. 
Stupid bastards. But they won’t let 
you in without a pass, you watch 
and see.” 

“Old man, be silent,” Benito 
said. 

“Humph.” Phlegyas sculled 
more rapidly. The boat shot through 
the water. Now I could make out 
dim glowing red. The fog began to 
lift, and we could feet the heat. 

There were walls ahead of us. 
They had towers, and some of them 
were cherry red. The radiated heat 
was already uncomfortable. A low, 
wide mudbank stretched out from 
she walls to the swamp, and I could 
s ^e a landing dead ahead, at the end 
°* a narrow bay. 

We headed toward it. A man 
c ame out through a doorway in the 
'''all. He was old and bent, and he 
hobbled. He carried a box about a 
yard square and an inch deep. 

•NFERNO 



He shuffled to the water’s edge 
and used a shovel to fill his box 
with mud. Then he turned and ran, 
his robe flying out behind him as he 
darted back into the door he’d come 
so slowly out of. It didn’t make 
sense. 

1 turned to Benito, but he only 
shrugged. He didn’t know either. 

We passed the entrance to the 
bay. "You may let us out at this 
landing,” Benito said. 

“Nope.” Phlegyas continued to 
scull. 

"It would be more convenient.” 

"Yep.” 

“Then why don’t you do it?” I 
demanded. 

“Because I don’t have to,” 
Phlegyas answered. He continued to 
scull until we reached another land- 
ing. “Regulations say ferry terminal 
to ferry terminal, and that’s where I 
go. Nothing about any stops in 
Himuralibima’s Bay.” 

Benito frowned, but he didn’t 
say anything. The boat reached the 
dock area. There was no one to 
meet us, and I wasn’t sorry. 

“Off, off,” Phlegyas shouted. 
“There’s more coming. No rest for 
an old man, none at all. Off, off.” 
He reached for his cudgel and we 
scrambled ashore before he could 
smash us with it. As soon as we 
were off he was sculling away, 
headed for the other shore like a 
motorboat. 

The city was maybe a quarter- 
mile away across hard stinking 
mud. The walls were hot, although 
not as hot here as further away. A 
mile to our left was a tower that 
glowed cherry red. 

Thermals! There’d be thermals 
here, if a glider could get across the 

37 




swamp. It would take luck and 
we’d have to drag it pretty high up 
that cliff to make it, but it could be 
done. 

“Be very careful,” Benito said. 
“I will have to deceive the offi- 
cials. Do not undeceive them.” 

“You mean you’re gonna lie? 
Oh, Benito, that’s sinful. You could 
go to Hell for telling lies.” 

He took it seriously. “I know. It 
is one reason I am here.” 

“Um, but this is in a good 
cause. .” 

“I thought my deceits were in a 
good cause.” He shrugged. “The 
Commandment is against false wit- 
ness, and by extension, against 
malicious deceit, and fraud, and 
perversions of honesty and honor. 
We shall not do that, and as you 
say, it is in a good cause. Or so I 
hope. We tread dangerous ground, 
Allen.” 

“Come on,” I said. I started off 
toward the door I could see ahead 
of us. Fat chance I’d ever make that 
joke with him again. 

It was getting warmer all the 
time. Off to our left, near the 
blazing-hot tower, were the remains 
of a big gate, torn off its hinges. 
Things walked guard duty in front 
of it. They were just far enough 
away, and there was just enough 
fog and steam, that I couldn’t see 
them clearly. But the shapes seemed 
odd, twisted out of true. I didn’t 
want to ask about them. 

We came to a Dutch-type door 
open at the top and with a counter 
on the lower half. Heat poured out 
through the opening. A bored- 
looking man in a high stiff collar, 
something out of a Dickens novel, 
was inside in a little office. His face 

38 



was narrow and pinched, and the 
heat couldn’t have improved his 
disposition. He had a desk like a 
woodcut from the Scrooge story, a 
tall thing he stood at. There wasn’t 
a chair or a stool in the room. We 
waited at the counter. 

And waited, and waited, getting 
warmer and warmer, while the clerk 
fussed with papers on his desk. He 
seemed to be reading every line on 
an enormous form a dozen pages 
thick. Every now and then he used 
a red pencil to mark something. 
When he continued to turn the 
pages and scrawl notes without even 
looking at us, I pounded on the 
counter. 

“Are we invisible?” I demanded. 

“A moment, sir. Just a moment, 
please. We’re very shorthanded 
here, sir. You’ll have to wait, sir.” 
He made each ‘sir’ a curse. 

“You would be well advised to 
attend us.” Benito’s voice had that 
edge to it, a note of warning. The 
clerk looked around uneasily. He 
obviously didn’t recognize either of 
us. Hardly surprising. 

“Your papers, please.” 

“We have none,” Benito 
answered. 

“Oh my, oh my, one of those 
days,” the clerk muttered. “Well, 
if you haven’t any papers, you can’t 
come in. The rules are very strict. 
You’ll have to go back for papers.' 
He turned back to his desk an< 
started looking over the files on it. 

“We have an errand inside,’ 
Benito said. “You do not help you 
record by delaying us.” 

The clerk looked back nervously 
He examined us closely again, not 
ing the slime on our gowns and thr 
stench of our sandals. That seemet 

GALAXY 




to cheer him. “What is your station 
inside?” he asked. 

“No fixed post,” Benito 



answered. 

“I can t help you, sir. I m only 
record-keeper for the Sixth Circle. 
Next window, please.” He turned 
back to his desk. We waited. Benito 
whistled something monotonous. 
Finally the clerk turned back. “You 
still here, sir? I told you, next win- 
dow, please.” 

“It is to the Sixth Circle that we 



must go now.” 

“Why didn’t you tell me,” the 
clerk complained. “Very well.” He 
reached into a cabinet and produced 
what looked like, manuscript books 
and short stubs of pencil. “If you 
don’t have the proper papers, you’ll 
have to fill out these forms.” 

They were twenty pages long, 
covered with small blanks, and 
there were nine copies. Not only 
wasn’t there any carbon paper, but 
the blanks were arranged differently 
on each copy, although they all 
asked for the same information. 

“I think we will not bother,” 
Benito said. 

I flared up. “What the hell do 
you want all this for? Great grand- 
mother’s blood type! Why should I 
fill this out?” 



“You have to.” The clerk was 
getting more and more irritated'. 
“You can see they’re all blank. 
You can see they have to be filled 
out. Right at the top, see, it says, 
replacement for lost papers, appli- 
cation for, D-345t839y^4583, to be 
submitted in nine copies’. I can’t do 
anything for you without that in- 
formation.” 

“Aren’t there exceptions?” 

“Of course there are exceptions,

sir. One was made over two 
thousand years ago. Before my 
time, but they still talk about it.” 
He shuddered. “But you are obvi- 
ously not Him. Is either of you a 
living man? Can either of you 
summon angels? Those are in the 
book too.” He glanced at a shelf of 
loose-leaf folios above his desk. 
“Volume 61, page 894, paragraph 
77.82 — I’m glad we changed to de- 
cimal system, but most of us didn’t 
like it — it says very plainly, anyone 
who can summon angels may pass. 
But if you’re applying under that 
ruling you’ll have to go to the main 
gate. Don’t prove you can do it. 
Just go to the main gate and they’ll 
take care of you.” 

“But you will not let us pass,” 
Benito said. “Not even*if I tell you 
that if you do not you will be in 
grave trouble?” 

39 





“I know my duty. You will not 
come through.” 

“Very good. You have done 
well,” Benito said. “If you had let 
us in, we would have reported it. 
Now you have a favorable report 
coming. Who is your supervisor?” 

The clerk stared at Benito. “Mrs. 
Playfair. Formerly a postmistress. 
But—” 

“Oh, my,” said Benito. “I 
won’t be able to help you after all. 
It would do no good to give the re- 
port to her." 

The clerk was unsettled. “Why 
not, sir?” The sir wasn’t a curse 
any longer. 

“I am not permitted to say.” 

“Ah. You mean — ” He gulped. 
Whatever he imagined was going to 
happen to Mrs. Playfair worried 
him excessively. “But what will 
happen to her people? What will 
become of me?" 

Benito looked crestfallen. “You 
know the rules — ” 

“But I’ve done everything prop- 
erty] My files are in perfect 
order — oh dear, oh dear, I told her 
she shouldn’t have let that man in 
the records room, I told her he 
wasn’t properly credentialled, I told 
her! It was all her fault, I told 
her. .my files are in perfect order. 
And they won’t even look at them, 
they’ll just — ” He was actually 
wringing his hands as he looked 
around his” office at his desk and 
files. 

Benito frowned. “It would be a 
waste to have you in the boiling 
pitch — ” 

“IN THE PITCH!” the clerk 
screamed. 

“Are you certain your files are in 
perfect order?” Benito demanded. 

40 



“Of course they are! Here, you 
can see for yourself.” He did some- 
thing that opened the gate. 

Benito and I crowded in. Benito 
took down a volume of the rule 
book and leafed through it. “Keep 
this up to date, do you? All revi- 
sions in place as they come in? 
Where are your unfiled revision 
sheets?” 

“There are none,” the clerk said 
primly. 

“Hmm.” Benito lifted the forms 
on the clerk’s desk. "This is not in 
order!” He leafed through quickly. 

“But I hadn’t checked the 
seventh copy yet!” the clerk 
moaned. “I was doing that when 
you interrupted me! You can’t re- 
port me for that, I was trying to 
give you service, and — ” 

Benito handed the forms back. 
The clerk looked through and ex- 
tracted a bulky set. There was pen- 
cil all over the first six pages, then 
the writing medium changed to 
something darker. Benito looked at 
it curiously. “This is hardly legi- 
ble.” 

“He used up his pencil,” the 
clerk said. “Volume 4, page 98, 
paragraph 6, states that no applicant 
can have more than one pencil. So I 
made him fill it out with something 
else. He used blood.” 

“His own?” I asked. 

“Where else would he gel 
blood?” The clerk turned to Benito. 
“Who is this man?” 

“In my custody. Witness. Not 
your case, don’t worry about it.” 
He handed back the forms. “This 
seems to be in order. ” 

“Thank you.” There was relief 
all over the clerk’s face. 

“One item was very difficult to 

GALAXV 




read. You should be more careful 
next time.” 

“Yes, sir. Certainly, sir. Are you 
finished with it?” 

Benito nodded. The clerk took 
the form — copy seven of nine 
copies — and tossed it into a waste- 
basket in the comer. It burst into 
flames. I stared. A man had used 
his own blood to fill that out? I 
glanced at the forms the clerk had 
handed us. 

Sure enough, at the top of copy 
seven, it said, “DESTROY”. Copy 
eight went to “applicant” and copy 
nine was “To be routed to the 
statistical section”. 

“What will be the charges 
against Mrs. Playfair?” the clerk 
asked, his voice low and confiden- 
tial. 

Benito frowned. “I understand 
there are shortages in uniforms and 
supply — ” 

“But we don’t have anything to 
do with that.” 

“Precisely,” Benito said know- 
ingly. Comprehension dawned on 
the clerk’s face. He nodded. 

“We’re going to check that 
now,” Benito said. “Keep up the 
good work, uh — ” 

“MacMurdo. Vincent MacMur- 
do. You’ll remember?” 

“Certainly.” Benito opened the 
inner door and held it for me. I 
went through, trying not to hurry. 

X 

Benito followed and closed the 
door behind him. I slumped against 
the wall, convulsed by silent laugh- 
ter. 

1 jumped away fast. The wall was 
burning hot. I smelled scorched 

inferno 



cloth. Another second and I’d have 
had a bad bum. 

We were in a corridor that 
stretched to infinity in both direc- 
tions. It was about ten feet high and 
wide, and there were doors at inter- 
vals along it. People hurried in both 
directions, paying us no attention. 

And there were all kinds of 
people! Men and women in flowing 
robes, in US Post Office uniforms, 
in colonial costumes, in the high 
collars the Dickensian clerk had 
worn, military uniform, Chinese 
mandarin robes, modern business 
suits, coveralls with insignia of 
planets and stars and sunbursts, a 
whirl of scurrying humanity shoving 
past us as if we weren’t there. 

Nobody was going to notice us 
for our funny clothing. 

The old man we’d seen outside 
rushed past us, almost running. He 
carried a box of fresh mud, and 
poked at it with a stick as he ran. 
We watched as he turned through a 
door and out of sight. 

Someone had stopped beside us 
and was laughing. He wore a Ro- 
man toga. 

“Do you speak English?” I 
asked. 

“Certainly.” He was still laugh- 
ing. 

“Who was that?” I asked. 

The laughter stopped and the man 
glared. He was carrying some kind 
of wood plank with wax on it. 
There were letters cut in the wax. 
“You are new here?” he de- 
manded. 

“From another division,” Benito 
said quickly. He lowered his voice. 
“Special assignment.” 

The. Roman drew away from us. 
“Surely you have no interest in 

41 




Himuralibima? He is our most hon- 
ored civil servant.” 

Benito gave a knowing look. I 
still had a blank stare. 

“Hammurabi’s secretary, you 
know. Invented record-keeping.” 

“Ah,” 1 said. Hammurabi? Oh, 
all right, he's Hammurabi' s secre- 
tary. And / am Napoleon Bonaparte. 
“You’d think after all these years 
they’d let him slow down a little.” 

“But he can't,” the Roman pro- 
tested. “They’ve offered him re- 
tirement, but he has to fill out the 
proper forms, and in his case, of 
course they’re in cuneiform. And 
you have noticed how hot it is in 
here?” 

I couldn’t stand it. I tipped my 
head back and roared with laughter. 
It rolled out, gales of laughter, 
choking me, as I thought of that 
first beaurocrat trying to complete 
his retirement papers before the 
mud dried from the heat. 

. Himuralibimas’s Bay? 

Benito merely nodded. “Fitting. I 
am certain you have work. 
Signor — ?” 

“Uh, of course,” the Roman 
said. “Your pardon.” He pushed 
past us and walked briskly down the 
corridor. Our clerk came out of his 
office. The Roman stopped and they 
talked in whispers. 

“Allen, must you ask unneces- 
sary questions?” Benito demanded. 

“I’m a writer. Of course I ask 
questions.” 

“Please do not. Not in here. For 
the moment we are safe. They 
think — ” He motioned with his 
eyes. 

I turned my eyes only. The Ro- 
man had stopped someone else and 
was whispering to him. The man 



he’d stopped, a young man in 
1930’s US Army uniform, nodded. 
Pretty soon he stopped someone and 
both looked clandestinely at us. 
They stopped others. 

“They’re telling stories about 
us,” I said. 

“Yes. Let us hope they are tel- 
ling the proper ones. Now we must 
find the supply center.” 

^^herever we went we were 
preceded and followed by whispers. 
People got out of our way, too. If 
we wanted to go through a door, if 
we even looked like we wanted to 
go through a door, there was a 
scramble to hold it open for us. 

“They sure are scared of you,” I 
said. “They know who you are.” 
Which was more than I did. 

“I think few of them have seen 
or heard of me,” Benito answered. 

Oh, really? “You know your 
way around here.” 

“No. I know my way around 
beaurocracies. This one is no diffe- 
rent from any other.” 

“You were a beaurocrat once?” 
He hesitated. “I suppose you 
might say so.” 

“Exactly what — ” 

An anguished voice drowned me 
out. We were passing an open door, 
and a woman’s voice screamed in 
rage and pain: “But that form is 
twenty-seven pages long! All that 
for one tool?” 

• I looked in, caught a familiar 
hawklike profile, turned back and 
kept walking. “Don’t look now,” I 
said out of the corner of my mouth. 

The other voice followed us. 
“You should keep better track of 
your handsaw. The rules are very 
clear.

GALAXY 




At the next door there was a long 
line of naked people, fat men, 
pretty girls, ugly women, studs, ev- 
ery form and variety of mankind: 
the reception desk at a streaker con- 
vention. They were trying to get to 
a counter where some fat guy 
handed them clothing while two 
beanpole women took information 
down on more forms. 

What was this? The supply center 
for Infernoland? Were these 
employees, or spectators, or — 

— or what? 

We got in line, the only ones 
with clothing who did. A thin guy 
in a medieval bachelor gown came 
in, went behind the counter, and 
whispered to the supply clerk. The 
clerk summoned his two old biddies 
and they whispered together. 

Finally one of the women came 
out from behind the counter. She 
wore a coverall of a kind I didn’t 
recognize, dark blue with strange 
insignia. “What may we do for 
you?” she asked. She was trying to 
be pleasant and it was obvious that 
she’d never learned how. 

“This man was given the wrong 
clothing,” Benito said. “He is 
wearing the same thing 1 am. In our 
section we do not give junior cour- 
riers the uniform of a supervisor.” 

She frowned. Benito didn’t look 
to be dressed like a supervisor. He 
looked like an escapee from the vio- 
lent ward. So did I. But he only 
stared back, and after awhile her 
eyes dropped. “What should he 
wear?” she said. 

“Loincloth. And there are nine 
senior men in my section who have 
loincloths and no gowns. It is in- 
tolerable.” 

“Oh.” She didn’t know what to

make of that. She went back and 
whispered to the other biddy. 

Meanwhile the line moved up. 
The clerk looked at papers and then 
at the fat man at the head of the 
line. He went into the shelving 
stacks behind the counter and came 
back with bright gaudy clothes, 
slashed velvet sleeves and tight 
trousers. They were obviously too 
small. 

“Ungood. Double plus ungood. 
Too small. Wrong period,” the fat 
man protested. 

“Tough shit, buddy. We all got 
our troubles. Next!” 

The biddies came over to him 
and whispered. He looked at us. 
“Uh, you sirs — can I help you?” 

Three helped carry the gowns, 
and a fourth brought up the rear 
with stacks of papers flowing with 
seals and ribbons. Benito paid no 
attention to me; he just walked 
ahead as if he assumed we’d all fol- 
low, which we did. 

We turned a corner and he 
stopped. “This will do,” he said. 
“Give those things to Allen. You 
have your work to do, and this is 
his task.” 

“Certainly, sir. Is there nothing 
else we can do for you?” This one 
wore a policewoman’s uniform, 
vaguely American, though the 
shield was shaped strangely. She 
talked without using articles. When 
she spoke to her subordinates she 
used a language I didn’t know. I 
was afraid to ask her deathdate. 

“I said this will do,” Benito 
said. “We will be met by others. 
You may go.” 

“Thank you, sir.” The sow 



turned and stalked away followed 
by the others. 

When she was out of sight Benito 
seemed to wilt. His straight posture 
was gone, the high angle of the 
chin vanished, and he slumped. 

Then he laughed. “So. Nothing 
changes. Now we must get out of 
here before someone tells this story 
to an internal security agent.” 

“They think — what? That we’re 
important officials?” 

“No. Of course not. They know 
we are only pretending that.” 

“Then what — ” 

“But they cannot be sure. We 
might be important officials. But 
most of them think we are secret 
police.” 

“But how do you know there are 
secret police?” 

Benito looked very sad. “Allen, 
there have to be. You cannot run a 
beaurocratic state without them. 
Come.” 

We found a door to the outside 
and Benito surrendered one of the 
documents he’d collected. We pas- 
sed through and were out on the 
mud flats again. A stinking breeze 
wrapped itself around me, delici- 
ously cool, and I said, “Ahh. .” 

Far to our right the old man had 
just filled his box of mud again. He 
ran for the gate, writing frantically. 



XI 

I was smiling as I turned. The 
robes I held stacked on my head, an 
ungainly load. “Now what?” 
Benito was staring across the 
swamp. “I don’t know.” 

“Ah?” 

“We cannot possibly persuade 



44 




Phlegyas to take us back. I fear we 
must swim.” He set his own stack 
of robes down, shook out the top 
robe and used it to tie the rest to- 
gether. 

Swim? Through that ? It wasn’t 
the garbage that turned me off. It 
was the bubbling of angry people in 
and under the water. If we met 
anyone like the guy Benito had 
thrown back into the water. .if we 
met half a dozen of them while 
loaded down with heavy wet stacks 
of robes! ‘‘Wait a minute, Benito. 
Let’s try something else.” 

“Lead on, then, Allen.” 

1 stopped to tie my bundle as Be- 
nito had tied his. Then I turned 
right along Himuralibima’s Bay. 
The choice was deliberate: here 
there were windows and doors along 
the wall. 

1 was wading thigh-deep and not 
liking it, but it was the only way to 
learn what I wanted to know. At 
worst I was postponing our swim. 
At best — “We’ve got plenty of 
time. You keep saying so.” 

“So we do. I wonder what you 
expect to find.” 

My foot brushed something soft. 
She was clearly visible beneath 
two feet of water: a longboned 
black woman with her hair floating 
•ike seaweed around a slack face. I 
asked a stupid question. “Is she 
dead?’ ’ 

“Of course,” said Benito. 

She was curled in foetal position. 
She stayed rigid as I rolled her to 
bring her head above water. There 
w as no sign of decay, and no sign 
' • :ife. But I felt for a pulse in her 
and found it. 

Catatonic.” And I started to get 
ac *- “Another catatonic. Of all the 

INf ERNO 



dirty things. We don’t persecute 
crazy people for crimes. What right 
do the Builders have to put crazy 
people in Hell?” 

“The Builders?” 

“Never mind. Of all the dirty 
things. Benito, can you handle two 
bundles for a minute?” 

He took my robes on his other 
shoulder. He waited while I reached 
into the water to adjust the woman’s 
position. 

Catatonia. It’s a rare enough dis- 
order, but almost incurable. You 
can find one or two catatonics in 
almost any mental hospital. They 
afford opportunity for endless jokes, 
all identical; for a catatonic will 
take any position you pull him into, 
and hold the pose indefinitely. 

Every intern thinks he is the first 
to see the possibilities. He will lead 
the resident catatonic to the hospital 
cafeteria, place him just outside the 
door, and leave him there with his 
thumb to his nose or his middle 
finger rigidly extended. Hilarious! 

Sometimes he gets a surprise. 

I had to stand on her knees to 
straighten her legs, but fianlly I got 
them stretched out in front of her. 
She was still leaning too far back, 
her eyes staring at infinity through a 
half-inch of scummy water. Still 
standing on her knees for leverage, 
I reached beneath the water, took 
her shoulders and pulled her up to 
sitting position. 

Now she’d be able to breathe. 

. .sometimes he gets a surprise, 
your antic intern. He will have just 
finished adjusting the patient’s hand 
with thumb properly to nose, when 
the hand becomes a fist and the first 
becomes a missile warhead. 
Catatonics are hideously strong. 

45 




They have to be, to hold one posi- 
tion forever. 

And she was sitting down. She 
lashed straight out and tried to 
punch a hole through my groin. She 
damned near made it. I whooped 
and doubled over, sucking air. 
Sucking, as it turned out, filthy wa- 
ter as I rolled helplessly over into 
the swamp. 

I tried to uncurl. My lungs still 
wanted to suck water. Inch by inch, 
I fought my mouth to the surface, 
drew a lungful of sweet stinking air, 
and screamed. 

Benito was sloshing toward me. I 
gestured him back. If he dropped 
the robes to help me, they’d quad- 
ruple in weight! 

He stopped. I waited for the pain 
to ease a little, then tried to stand 
up. When I put weight on my legs 
it felt like she’d hit me again. I 
moved toward shore, doubled over. 

The woman’s lower lip was just 
at the surface of the water. She held 
her arm straight out, first clenched. 
“Don’t make waves,’’ I told her 
sourly as I passed. She didn’t re- 
spond, and she still looked dead. 
Water streamed from her nose. 

I didn’t stop for any more 
catatonics. Gradually I was able to 
straighten up. Benito followed pa- 
tiently, carrying both bundles, both 
of us wading thigh-deep in water. I 
ignored the floating garbage. It 
wasn’t getting me any dirtier than I 
already was. 

The texture of the bottom had 
changed. Beneath a film of friction- 
less mud there were tilted slabs that 
had sharp corners and tended to 
slide. I stopped. Benito stopped 
behind me. 



I said, “Feel that?” 

Benito didn’t get it. “What 
should I feel?” 

“Himuralibima’s Ford, that’s 
what! No telling how far it goes, 
but it should get us a good distance 
across the swamp. Here, give me 
that.” I took one of the bundles and 
started into the swamp. The footing 
was chancy, the slabs tended to 
slide, but it was better than swim- 
ming. 

And I, feeling that I had earned 
the right to brag, bragged. “All 
along I wondered where the dried 
mud was going. It’d shrink a little 
when the water evaporated, but 
even so, that bay is huge. Where do 
they dump the slabs after 
Himuralibima gives up? Maybe I’d 
find a mountain of them. Or maybe 
they don’t want a pile of ruined 
clay slabs in their working area. 
Maybe they’re afraid of getting 
ticked off for sloppiness. 

“So, I was right. Someone’s 
been dumping the slabs in the bay. 
Every hundred years he has to walk 
a little further. Otherwise they’d 
show above the surface.” 

“Very clever, Allen.” 

“ Thank kew.” No telling how 
far it would go; but we were a good 
distance into the swamp, and the 
water was only up to our calves. 
Hold your breath and make a wish, 
Carpentier. Or just hold your 
breath, the water could be over 
your head any second. 

Wh were nearly across before it 
ended. The slabs dipped, and I fol- 
lowed the dip, walking on eggs, 
with the stack of robes balanced on 
my head. I was chin deep where the 
mud turned squish-soft.

GALAXY 




So far, so good. I found an un- 
derwater ridge and followed that go- 
ing waist deep, then higher. 1 was 
wading ashore, with Benito behind 
me, when our luck ran out. 

The broad-shouldered man who 
blocked our path was the same who 
had blocked our path before. He 
shied back when he recognized us; 
and then he saw our situation, and 
grinned. 

I turned back to Benito. “Mind if I 
try this?” 

“If you think it will help.” 

‘‘I wrote science fiction, re- 
member? I ought to be able to ex- 
plain a complicated idea to a 
moron.” 

I hadn’t lowered my voice. The j 
broad-shouldered man advanced on I 
us, saying, “Who’s a moron?” 

“Don’t worry about it,” 1 told ' 
him. “You’ve got worse problems 
than that. Remember the flying les- 
son?” 

His grin was back. “I’d like to 
see old Benito try that with his arms 
full of bedsheets!” 

“He won’t be able to,” 1 said, 
keeping my speech slow and dis- 
tinct. ‘‘He’ll have to put them 
down. In the swamp.” Pause. 
‘‘They’ll get all dirty.” Pause. 
“Imagine what that will do to his 
temper.” 

I watched his eyes. It was getting 
through to him. I said, “Why don’t 
you step aside while you think it 
over?” 

“Some guys would rather talk 
than fight,” he said contemptuous- 
ly. He turned and stalked back to 
his point of high ground.

RANKS 

of 

BRONZE 

DAVID DRAKE 

The rising sun is a dagger point 
casting long shadows toward Vib- 
ulenus and his cohort from the na- 
tive breastworks. The legion had 
formed ranks an hour before; the 
enemy is not yet stirring. A playful 
breeze with a bitter edge skitters out 
of the south, and the Tribune 
swings his shield to his right side 
against it. 

“When do we advance, sir?” his 
First Centurion asks. Gnaeus 
Clodius Calvus, promoted to his 
present position after a boulder had 
pulped his predecessor during the 
assault on a granite fortress far 
away. Vibulenus only vaguely re- 
calls his first days with the cohort, 
a boy of eighteen in titular com- 
mand of four hundred and eighty 
men whose names he had despaired 
of learning. Well', he knows them 
now. Of course, there are only two 
hundred and ninety-odd left to re- 
member. 

Calvus’ bearded, silent patience 
snaps Vibulenus back to the pre- 
sent. “When the cavalry comes up, 
|hey told me. Some kinglet or other 
Is supposed to bring up a couple 
thousand men to close our flanks. 



Otherwise, we’re hanging. .” 

The Tribune’s voice trails off. He 
stares across the flat expanse of 
gravel toward the other camp, re- 
membering another battle plain of 
long ago. 

“Damn Parthians,” Calvus mut- 
ters, his thought the same. 

Vibulenus nods. “Damn Crassus, 
you mean. He put us there, and that 
put us here. The stupid bastard. But 
he got his, too.” 

The legionaries squat in their 
ranks, talking and chewing bits of 
bread or dried fruit. They display 
no bravado, very little concern. 
They have been here too often be- 
fore. Sunlight turns their shield- 
facings green: not the crumbly fun- 
gus of verdigris but the shimmering 
sea-color of the harbor of Brun- 
disium on a foggy morning. 

Oh, Mother Vesta, Vibulenus 
breathes to himself. He is five foot 
two, about average for the legion. 
His hair is black where it curls un- 
der the rim of his helmet and he has 
no trace of a beard. Only his eyes 
make him appear more than a teen- 
ager; they would suit a tired man of 
fifty. 

A trumpet from the command 
group in the rear sings three quick 
bars. “Fall in!” the Tribune orders, 
but his centurions are already bark- 
ing their own commands. These too 
are lost in the clash of hobnails on 
gravel. The Tenth Cohort could 
form ranks in its sleep. 

Halfway down the front, a legion- 
ary’s cloak hooks on a notch in his 




shield rim. He tugs at it, curses in 
Oscan as Calvus snarls down the 
line at him. Vibulenus makes a 
mental note to check with the cen- 
turion after the battle. That fellow 
should have been issued a replace- 
ment shield before disembarking. 
He glances at his own. How many 
shields has he carried? Not that it 
matters. Armor is replaceable. He is 
wearing his fourth cuirass, now, 
though none of them have fit like 
the one his father had bought him 
the day Crassus granted him a 
tribune’s slot. Vesta. 

A galloper from the command 
group skids his beast to a halt with 
a needlessly brutal jerk on its reins. 
Vibulenus recognizes him — 
Pompilius Falco. A little swine 
when he joined the legion, an ac- 
complished swine now. Not bad with 
animals, though. “We’ll be advanc- 
ing without the cavalry,” he shouts, 
leaning over in his saddle. “Get 
your line dressed.” 

“Osiris’ bloody dick we will!” 
the Tribune snaps. “Where’s our 
support?” 

“Have to support yourself, I 
guess,” shrugs Falco. He wheels 
his mount. Vibulenus steps forward 
and catches the reins. 

“Falco,” he says with no attempt 
to lower his voice, “you tell our 
deified Commander to get some- 
body on our left flank if he expects 
the Tenth to advance. There’s too 
many natives — they’ll hit us from 
three sides at once.” 

“You afraid to die?” the galloper 

50 



sneers. He tugs at the reins. 

Vibulenus holds them. A gust of 
wind whips at his cloak. “Afraid to 
get my skull split?” he askes. “I 
don’t know. Are you, Falco?” 
Falco glances at where the 
Tribune’s right hand rests. He says 
nothing. “Tell him we’ll fight for 
him,” Vibulenus goes on. “We 
won’t let him throw us away. 
We’ve gone that route once.” He 
looses the reins and watches the 
galloper scatter gravel on his way 
back. 

The replacement gear is solid 
enough, shields that do not split 
when dropped and helmets forged 
without thin spots. But there is no 
craftsmanship in them. They are 
heavy, lifeless. Vibulenus still car- 
ries a bone-hilted sword from To- 
ledo that required frequent sharpen- 
ing but was tempered and 
balanced — poised to slash a life out, 
as it has a hundred times already. 
His hand continues to caress the 
palm-smoothed bone, and it calms 
him somewhat. 

“Thanks, sir.” 

The thin-featured tribune glances' 
back at his men. Several of the; 
nearer ranks give him a spontaneous 
salute. Calvus is the one who 
spoke. He is blank-faced now, a 
statue of mahogany and strap- 
bronze. His stocky form radiates 
pride in his leader. Leader — no 
one in the group around the standards 
can lead a line soldier, though they 
may give commands that will be 
obeyed. Vibulenus grins and slaps 

GALAXY 




Calvus’ burly shoulder. “Maybe 
this is the last one and we’ll be go- 
ing home,” he says. 

IVlbVEMENT THROWS A HAZE Over 
the enemy camp. At this distance it is 
impossible to distinguish forms, but 
metal flashes in the viridian sun- 
light. The shadow of bodies spreads 
slowly to right and left of the 
breastworks as the natives order 
themselves. There are thousands of 
them, many thousands. 

“Hey-y/p!” Twenty riders of the 
general’s bodyguard pass behind the 
cohort at an earthshaking trot. They 
rein up on the left flank, shrouding 
the exposed depth of the infantry. 
Pennons hang from the lances sock- 
eted behind their right thighs, gay 
yellows and greens to keep the 
lance heads from being driven too 
deep to be jerked out. The riders’ 
faces are sullen under their mesh 
face guards. Vibulenus knows how 
angry they must be at being shifted 
under pressure — under his 
pressure — and he grins again. The 
bodyguards are insulted at being re- 
quired to fight instead of remaining 
nobly aloof from the battle. The ex- 
perience may do them some good. 

At least it may get a few of the 
snotty bastards killed. 

‘‘Not exactly a regiment of caval- 
ry,” Calvus grumbles. 

“He gave us half of what was 
available,” Vibulenus replies with a 
shrug. “They’ll do to keep the na- 
tives off our back. Likely nobody’ll 

RANKS OF BRONZE 



come near, they look so mean.” 

The centurion taps his thigh with 
his knobby swagger stick. “Mean? 
We’ll give’em mean.” 

All the horns in the command 
group sound together, a cacopho- 
nous bray. The jokes and scufflings 
freeze, and only the south wind 
whispers. Vibulenus takes a last 
look down his ranks — each of them 
fifty men abreast and no more sway 
to it than a tight-stretched cord 
would leave. Five feet from shield 
boss to shield boss, room to swing 
a sword. Five feet from nose guard 
to the nose guards of the next rank, 
men ready to step forward individu- 
ally to replace the fallen or by ranks 
to lock shields with the front line in 
an impenetrable wall of bronze. The 
legion is a restive dragon, and its 
teeth glitter in its spears; one verti- 
cal behind each legionary’s shield, 
one slanted from each right hand to 
stab or throw. 

The horns blare again, the eagle 
standard slants forward, and Vib- 
ulenus’ throat joins three thousand 
others in a death-rich bellow as the 
legion steps off on its left foot. The 
centurions are counting cadence and 
the ranks blast it back to them in 
the crash-jingle of boots and gear. 

Striding quickly between the 
legionaries, Vibulenus checks the 
dress of his cohort. He should have 
a horse, but there are no horses in 
the legion now. The command 
group rides rough equivalents which 
are. .very rough. Vibulenus is not 
sure he could accept one if his par- 

51 




simonious employers offered it. 

His men are a smooth bronze 
chain that advances in lock step. 
Very nice. The nine cohorts to the 
right are in equally good order, but 
Hercules! there are so few of them 
compared to the horde swarming 
from the native camp. Somebody 
has gotten overconfident. The 
enemy raises its own cheer, scat- 
tered and thin at first. But it goes 
on and on, building, ordering itself 
to a blood-pulse rhythm that moans 
across the intervening distance, the 
gap the legion is closing at two 
steps a second. Hercules! there is a 
crush of them. 

The natives are close enough to 
be individuals now: lanky, long- 
armed in relation to a height that 
averages greater than that of the 
legionaries. Ill-equipped, though. 
Their heads are covered either by 
leather helmets or beehives of their 
own hair. Their shields appear to be 
hide and wicker affairs. What could 
live on this gravel waste and pro- 
vide that much leather? But of 
course Vibqlenus has been told 
none of the background, not even 
the immediate geography. There is 
some place around that raises 
swarms of warriors, that much is 
certain. 

And they have iron. The black 
glitter of their spearheads tightens 
the Tribune’s wounded chest as he 
remembers. 

“Smile, boys,” one of the cen- 
turions calls cheerfully, “here’s 
company.” With his words a jave- 

52 



lin hums down at a steep angle to 
spark on the ground. From a spear- 
thrower, must have been. The dis- 
tance is too long for any arm Vib- 
ulenus has seen, and he has seen his 
share. 

“Ware!” he calls as another 
score of missiles arc from the native 
ranks. Legionaries judge them, raise 
their shields or ignore the plunging 
weapons as they choose. One 
strikes in front of Vibulenus and 
shatters into a dozen iron splinters 
and a knobby shaft that looks like 
rattan. One or two of the men have 
spears clinging to their shield faces. 
Their clatter syncopates the thud of 
boot heels. No one is down. 

Vibulenus runs two paces ahead 
of his cohort, his sword raised at an 
angle. It makes him an obvious 
target: a dozen javelins spit toward 
him. The skin over his ribs crawls, 
the lumpy breadth of scar tissue 
scratching like a rope over the 
bones. But he can be seen by every 
man in his cohort, and somebody 
has to give the signal. 

“Now!” he shouts vainly in the 
mingling cries. His arm and sword 
cut down abruptly. Three hundred 
throats give a collective grunt as the 
cohort heaves its own massive 
spears with the full weight of its 
rush behind them. Another light 
javelin glances from the shoulder of 
Vibulenus’ cuirass, staggering him. 
Calvus’ broad right palm catches 
the Tribune, holds him upright for 
the instant he needs to get his bal- 
ance. 



GALAXY 




The front of the native line 
explodes as the Roman spears crash 
into it. 

Fifty feet ahead there are orange 
warriors shrieking as they stumble 
over the bodies of comrades whose 
armor has shredded under the im- 
pact of the heavy spears. “At’em!” 
a front-rank file-closer cries, ignor- 
ing his remaining spear as he drags 
out his short sword. The trumpets 
are calling something but it no 
longer matters what: tactics go 
hang, the Tenth is cutting its way 
into another native army. 

In a brief spate of fury, Vib- 
ulenus holds his forward position 
between a pair of legionaries. A na- 
tive, orange-skinned with bright 
carmine eyes, tries to drag himself 
out of the Tribune’s path. A Roman 
spear has gouged through his shield 
and arm, locking all three together. 
Vibulenus’ sword takes the warrior 
alongside the jaw. The blood is 
paler than a man’s. 

The backward shock of meeting 
has bunched the natives. The press 
of undisciplined reserves from be- 
hind adds to their confusion. Vib- 
ulenus jumps a still-writhing body 
and throws himself into the wall of 
shields and terrified orange faces. 
An iron-headed spear thrusts at him, 
misses as another warrior jostles the 
wielder. Vibulenus slashes down- 
ward at his assailant. The warrior 
throws his shield up to catch the 
sword, then collapses when a 
second-rank legionary darts his 
spear through the orange abdomen. 

Ranks of bronze 



Breathing hard with his sword 
still dripping in his hand, Vibulenus 
lets the pressing ranks flow around 
him. Slaughter is not a tribune’s 
work, but increasingly Vibulenus 
finds that he needs the swift vio- 
lence of the battle line to release the 
fury building within him. The 
cohort is advancing with the jerky 
sureness of an ox-drawn plow in 
dry -soil. 

A windrow of native bodies lies 
among the line of first contact, now 
well within the Roman formation. 
Vibulenus wipes his blade on a fal- 
len warrior, leaving two sluggish 
runnels filling on the flesh. He 
sheathes the sword. Three bodies 
are sprawled together to form a 
hillock. Without hesitation the 
Tribune steps onto it to survey the 
battle. 

The legion is a broad awl punch- 
ing through a belt of orange leather. 
The cavalry on the left stand free in 
a scatter of bodies, neither 
threatened by the natives nor mak- 
ing any active attempt to drive them 
back. One of the mounts, a hairless 
brute combining the shape of a wolf- 
hound with the bulk of an ox, is 
feeding on a corpse his rider has 
lanced. Vibulenus was correct in 
expecting the natives to give them a 
wide berth; thousands of flanking 
warriors tremble in indecision rather 
than sweep forward to surround the 
legion. It would take more disci- 
pline than this orange rabble has 
shown to attack the toad-like riders 
on their terrible beasts. 



53 




.Dehind the lines, a hundred 
paces distant from the legionaries 
whose armor stands in hammering 
contrast to the naked autochthones, 
is the Commander and his remain- 
ing score of guards. He alone of the 
three thousand who have landed 
from the starship knows why the 
battle is being fought, but he seems 
to stand above it. And if the silly 
bastard still has half his bodyguard 
with him — Mars and all the gods, 
what must be happening on the 
right flank? 

The inhuman shout of triumph 
that rises half a mile away gives 
Vibulenus an immediate answer. 

“Prepare to disengage!” he or- 
ders the nearest centurion. The 
swarthy non-com, son of a North 
African colonist, speaks briefly into 
the ears of two legionaries before 
sending them to the ranks forward 
and back of his. The legion is tight 
for men, always has been. Tribunes 
have no runners, but the cohort 
makes do. 

Trumpets blat in terror. The na- 
tive warriors boil whooping around 
the Roman right flank. Legionaries 
in the rear are facing about with 
ragged suddeness, obeying instinct 
rather than the orders bawled by 
their startled officers. The command 
group suddenly realizes the situa- 
tion. Three of the bodyguard charge 
toward the oncoming orange mob. 
The rest of the guards and staff 
scatter into the infantry. 

The iron-bronze clatter has ceased 
on the left flank. When the cohort 

54 



halts its advance, the natives gain 
enough room to break and flee for 
their encampment. Even the war- 
riors who have not engaged are 
cowed by the panic of those who 
have; by the panic, and the sprawls 
of bodies left behind them. 

“About face!” Vibulenus calls 
through the indecisive hush, “and 
pivot on your left flank. There’s 
some more barbs want to fight the 
Tenth!” 

The murderous cheer from his 
legionaries overlies the noise of the 
cohort executing his order. 

As it swings Vibulenus runs 
across the new front of his troops, 
what had been the rear rank. The 
cavalry, squat-bodied and grim in 
their full armor, shows sense 
enough to guide their mounts to- 
ward the flank of the Ninth Cohort 
as Vibulenus rotates his men away 
from it. Only a random javelin from 
the native lines appears to hinder 
them. Their comrades who re- 
mained with the Commander have 
been less fortunate. 

A storm of javelins has disinteg- 
rated the half-hearted charge. Two 
of the mounts have gone down de- 
spite their heavy armor. Behind 
them, the Commander lies flat on 
the hard soil while his beast 
screams horribly above him. The 
shaft of a stray missile projects 
from its withers. Slabbing up from 
below, the orange warriors fell the 
remaining lancer and gut his com- 
panions as they try to rise. Half a 
dozen of the bodyguards canter 

GALAXY 




nervously back from their safe 
bolthole among the infantry to try to 
rescue their employer. The wounded 
mount leaps at one of the lancers. 
The two beasts tangle with the 
guard between them. A clawed hind 
leg flicks his head. Helmet and 
head rip skyward in a spout of 
green ichor. 

“Charge!” Vibulenus roars. The 
legionaries who can not hear him 
follow his running form. The knot 
of cavalry and natives is a quarter 
mile away. The cohorts of the right 
flank are too heavily engaged to do 
more than defend themselves 
against the new thrust. Half the le- 
gion has become a bronze worm, 
bristling front and back with spear- 
points against the surging orange 
flood. Without immediate support, 
the whole right flank will be 
squeezed until it collapses into a 
tangle of blood and scrap metal. 
The Tenth Cohort is their support, 
all the support there is. 

“Rome!” the fresh veterans lead- 
ing the charge shout as their shields 
rise against the new flight of jave- 
lins. There are gaps in the back 
ranks, those just disengaged. Be- 
hind the charge, men hold palms 
clamped over torn calves or lie 
crumpled around a shaft of alien 
wood. There will be time enough 
for them if the recovery teams 
land — which they will not do in 
event of a total disaster on the 
ground. 

The warriors snap and howl at 
the sudden threat. Their own suc- 

Ranks of bronze 



cess has fragmented them. What 
had been a flail slashing into mas- 
sed bronze kernels is now a 
thousand leaderless handfuls in 
sparkling contact with the Roman 
line. Only the leaders bunched 
around the command group have 
held their unity. 

One mount is still on its feet and 
snarling. Four massively-equipped 
guards try to ring the Commander 
with their maces. The Commander, 
his suit a splash of blue against the 
gravel, tries to rise. There is a 
flurry of mace stroks and quickly- 
riposting spears, ending in a clash 
of falling armor and an agile orange 
body with a knife leaping the crum- 
pled guard. Vibulenus’ sword, flung 
overarm, takes the native in the 
throat. The inertia of its spin cracks 
the hilt against the warrior’s 
forehead. 

The Tenth Cohort is on the star- 
tled natives. A moment before the 
warriors were bounding forward in 
the flush of victory. Now they face 
the cohort’s meat-axe suddeness — 1 
and turn. At swordpoint and shield 
edge, as inexorable as the rising 
sun, the Tenth grinds the native re- 
treat into panic while the cohorts of 
the right flank open order and ad- 
vance. The ground behind them is 
slimy with blood. 

Vibulenus rests on one knee, 
panting. He has retrieved his sword. 
Its stickiness bonds it to his hand. 
Already the air keens with landing 
motors. In minutes the recovery 
teams will be at work on the fallen 

55 




legionaries, building life back into 
all but the brain-hacked or spine- 
severed. Vibulenus rubs his own 
scarred ribs in aching memory. 

A hand falls on the Tribune’s 
shoulder. It is gloved in a skin-tight 
blue material; not armor, at least 
not armor against weapons. The 
Commander’s voice comes from the 
small plate beneath his clear, round 
helmet. Speaking in Latin, his ac- 
cents precisely flawed, he says, 
“You are splendid, you warriors.” 

Vibulenus sneers though he does 
not correct the alien. Warriors are 
capering heroes, good only for dy- 
ing when they meet trained troops; 
when they meet the Tenth Cohort. 

“I thought the Federation Council 
had gone mad,” the flat voice con- 
tinues, “when it ruled that we must 
not land weapons beyond the native 
level in exploiting inhabited worlds. 
All very well to talk of the dangers 
of introducing barbarians to modem 
weaponry, but how else could my 
business crush local armies and not 
be bled white by transportation 
costs?’ ’ 

The Commander shakes his head 
in wonder at the carnage about him. 
Vibulenus silently wipes his blade. 
In front of him, Falco gapes toward 
the green sun. A javelin points from 
his right eyesocket. “When we 
purchased you from your Parthian 
captors it was only an experiment. 
Some of us even doubted it was 
worth the cost of the longevity 
treatments. In a way you are more 
effective than a Guard Regiment 

56 



with lasers; outnumbered, you beat 
them with their own weapons. They 
can’t even claim ‘magic’ as a salve 
to their pride. And at a score of 
other job sites you have done as 
well. And so cheaply!” 

“Since we have been satisfac- 
tory,” the Tribune says, trying to 
keep the hope out of his face, “will 
we be returned home now?” 

“Oh, goodness, no,” the alien 
laughs, “you’re far too valuble for 
that. But I have a surprise for you, 
one just as pleasant I’m sure — 
females.” 

“You found us real women?” 
Vibulenus whispers. 

“You really won’t be able to tell 
the difference,” the Commander 
says with paternal confidence. 



A million suns away on a farm 
in the Sabine hills, a poet takes the 
stylus from the fingers of a nude 
slave girl and writes, very quickly, 
And Crassus’s wretched soldier 
takes a barbarian wife from his cap- 
tors and grows old waging war for 
them. 

The poet looks at the line with a 
pleased expression. “It needs 
polish, of course,” he mutters. 
Then, more directly to the slave, he 
says, “You know, Leuconoe, 
there’s more than inspiration to 
poetry, a thousand times more; but 
this came to me out of the air.” 

Horace gestures with his stylus 
toward the glittering night sky. The 
girl smiles back at him. ★

HAYFORD PEIRCE 




The SPACEMASTER-Scout Mark IV 
of the University of Calcidone’s 
Museum of Comparative An- 
thropology came in through the up- 
per atmosphere like a hundred- 
thousand mile-an-hour blowtorch, 
appearing in the night sky over 
Atka in the Aleutian Islands as a 
hardly visible meteorite streaking 
toward the southwest. By the time it 
passed over San Francisco 2 minutes 
and 6 seconds later at 03:21 Pacific 
Daylight Time, it was an incandes- 
cent orange fireball that burned a 
path across the tortured atmosphere 
which only faded 40 minutes later, 
lighting the streets with an eerie 
Armageddon-moming glow that no 
one who saw it would ever forget. 

Alarms jangled in NORAD head- 
quarters under Cheyenne Mountain 
as the fireball ripped down the San 
Joaquin Valley, boomed past 
Phoenix and Las Cruces, and rattled 
the windows of El Paso before dis- 
appearing into the wastelands of 
West Texas. Initial print-outs pro- 
jected an impact zone somewhere 
between San Antonio and Houston, 
and Condition Red warnings flashed 
across the United States. The few 
remaining seconds to impact ticked 
by with dreadful inexorability. 

And nothing happened. 

Somewhere over the desolate 
hill-country in the triangle formed 
by Grandfalls, Fort Stockton, and 
Girvin, Texas, at an altitude of 
what was later calculated to be 
56,000 feet, the fireball vanished 
from the sky and the blip from the 

58 



radar screens as suddenly as if they 
had never been. The trailing sonic 
boom battered itself to death against 
the hills and King Mountain, and 
the remaining ionization of the shat- 
tered atmosphere merged a short 
time later into the morning sunrise. 
The Great Fireball of ’72 has passed 
into history. 

“Some ride,’’ said Huntleader 
Riderson sourly, wiping the sweat 
from his forehead. 

“I am sorry,’’ replied the 
SpaceMaster-Scout, “but cir- 
cumstances were temporarily barely 
within my control.” 

“So I noticed.” 

, “An easier entry would have 
meant a better than 91.7% chance 
of impacting at approximately 
98,794.6 miles per hour, in which 
case the stasis-field would probably 
have protected us from any further 
physical damage. But why,’’ it 
asked reasonably, “put it to the 
test? And how the inhabitants of 
this world would have reacted to 
having the equivalent of a fusion 
explosion touched off between two 
of their major cities, I leave to your 
conjecture.” 

Riderson rose from his padded 
contour chair, a tall, dark-haired, 
heavily-muscled man of indetermi- 
nate age. He scowled. “Inhabitants? 
You’re certain?” 

“Of course, Hunt.” The ship’s 
voice projected directly into his 
mind. “In the few minutes directly 
after we came out of space-drive I 
had little enough real-time to spend 

GALAXY 




on inconsequentials, but there was 
sufficient to take note of orbiting 
satellites, diverse forms of com- 
munication phemonena, and primi- 
tive efforts at tracking our passage 
by radar. Indeed, our passage 
through the heavens will certainly 
have been observed visually, and I 
suggest that the most urgent steps 
toward concealing our position be 
taken immediately.” 

“Where are we anyway?” asked 
Riderson, as he activated the 360- 
degree viewsets. “Are you sure this 
is even the right world? It looks 
more like the middle of nowhere to 
me. Dusty-looking hills, scattered 
boulders, scraggly vegetation, no 
pop-eyed locals selling tickets to see 
the spaceship.” 

The ship appeared to sigh. “This 
is indeed the correct world. But as 
you have so cunningly noted, we 
have fortunately landed in uninha- 
bited terrain. I managed to regain 
effective control at 56,000 feet, and 
instantly halted our passage, activat- 
ing all counter-observation mea- 
sures, and thereafter dropping like a 
stone. We should. Hunt, at that 
moment have completely vanished 
from all visual and electronic sur- 
veillance, but I stress my use of the 
word ‘should’. Unless the inhabit- 
ants of this world have developed 
an inertialess drive, they will have 
probably calculated our impact point 
as 371 miles to the east, but we are 
not yet certain what senses they 
may have developed, either natur- 
ally or artificially. I urge — ”

“Okay, okay. Time to crawl into 
a hole and pull the top over.” 

Riderson broke out a grav-sled 
and scouted the surrounding coun- 
tryside while the SpaceMaster-Scout 
dug a hole for itself by the simple 
process of molecular transfer, which 
in practice consisted of removing 
the dirt and stones from beneath its 
80-foot ovoid length and replacing 
them overhead until it had sunk 
gradually into a hole 60 feet deep. 

“It’s slower,” said the ship, 
“but safer. No heat emission or 
messy clouds of dust for busybodies 
to come across. 40 feet of dirt over 
us ought to be sufficient.” 

“For Zog’s immaculate soul,” 
snapped Riderson three miles away, 
“I’ve never known such a chatter- 
box pile of machinery. The sun’s 
almost up and that heap of dirt 
you’ve displaced sticks out like 
Xanthu’s Wart. Aren’t you through 
yet?” He wheeled the sled around. 

As he spoke, the 20-foot pile be- 
gan slowly melting away to merge 
with the adjoining landscape. He 
nodded approvingly, then got to 
work with the grav-sled to shape 
what little remained into an irregu- 
lar jumble of sand and boulders. 

Thoughtfully he fingered his 
chin. “Lacks that last little touch of 
the artist,” he muttered at last. De- 
ftly manipulating the sled’s tractor- 
beams, he uprooted and transplanted 
two solid-looking cottonwoods 
into the rocky mound. “There,” 
he said, brushing his hands in 

59 




satisfaction, “home.” 

A medium-sized boulder floated 
into the air, revealing a narrow pas- 
sage, held by repeller beams, slash- 
ing down through the earth to the 
ship’s surface. Riderson let the ship 
tractor his sled in. As it flowed 
through the outer integument, he 
saw the boulder overhead ease 
down and cover the passage. 

He stored the sled away and strol- 
led to the salon. Flopping down on 
a sofa, he kicked off his boots, then 
punched for a meal. The duplicator 
processed one out of its memory 
banks and materialized it before 
him, along with a sapphire vase of 
incandescent core-fire flowers. 

As he munched, the ship came to 
a decision and slapped him into a 
stasis field while going itself on 
emergency blackout. It became as 
inert and lifeless as an 80-foot hunk 
of buried granite, emitting only that 
slight radiation which characterizes 
your friendly neighborhood rock. 
Emergency equipment was on 
standby to camouflage the existence 
of the stasis field in the unlikely 
event this planet’s inhabitants had 
developed radar capable of penetrat- 
ing 40 feet of earth. They hadn’t. 

The psionic sensors Riderson had 
scattered about the hills reported di- 
rectly to the ship’s mind the move- 
ment of jackrabbits, lizards, and an 
occasional coyote, and the next day 
an overflight of three brown 
helicopters in a concentric search 
pattern. Later in the week, small 
four-wheeled vehicles climbed 



laboriously into the hills and beings 
in brown uniforms, apparently from 
evolutionary stock similar to 
Huntleader Riderson’s, got out to 
point instruments and take rock 
samples. The ship probed gently at 
the men and their instruments with 
a spectrum of gossimer-fine psionic 
sensors, already nearly certain that 
its safety was absolute. When it had 
finished its survey, it was con- 
vinced; full power was restored to 
the ship’s functioning and a com- 
munications cable run up through 
the earth and connected to an array 
of undetectable broadband receivers. 
The SpaceMaster-Scout began to 
teach itself the world’s languages. 

Riderson sat on in his stasis field, 
a spoonful of dessert posed before 
his lips. 

Two months passed. 

An expedition of geologists set 
up camp two miles to the soutwest 
and poked through the hills for evi- 
dence of a shattered meteorite. Af- 
ter ten days they went away and 
only the jackrabbits and lizards re- 
mained. 

A month later, Riderson experi- 
enced a slight flickering sensation 
as he completed the motion of in- 
troducing spoon to mouth. He 
chomped thoughtfully, then turned 
to fix his gaze on the wall clock. 

“Who’s running this ship,” he 
grated, “you or me?” 

“Do you really want me to ans- 
wer that?” inquired the Space- 
Master-Scout politely. 

“Oh, no comment.”

“I have determined the extent of 
the damage to the ship and have 
conceived a basic plan regarding its 
repairs. After a brief language les- 
son in the hypnotank and a smatter- 
ing of cosmetic surgery, you may 
begin its implementation later 
this—” 

“Surgery?” yelped Riderson. 

“Surgery,” replied the ship firm- 
ly. “Professor Camptargo will be 
extremely vexed: his lifelong deter- 
mination to prove that the entire 
galaxy’s sentient population is de- 
rived from the Great Migration of 

31.000 years ago has already been 
proven suspect. As the first expedi- 
tion into this arm since the Black 
Collapse and the Interregnum of 

27.000 years ago, we have already 
learned that the beings of this world 
are not of our stock.” 

“Not human? They certainly 
appear — ” 

“From a distance only. And their 
internal organs, from what I have 
been able to gather from their tele- 
vision advertisements, are entirely 
different. There are superficial ex- 
terior differences as well, which 
must be disguised. Rather than the 
lovely, flower-shaped orifices you 
possess for instance, these beings 
enclose their ears within what it 
would be charitable to refer to as 
fleshy extrusions. There are other 
minor details: only one thumb per 
hand, a larger — ” 

“Now wait just a minute here,” 
began Riderson. 

“You’ll hardly know the differ- 

HIGH YIELD BONDAGE 



ence,” soothed the ship. “Until we 
have access to a technical library — 
this world’s technology has not yet 
developed to the point of personal 
electronic retrieval systems — we 
won’t really understand their 
evolutionary development. It is cer- 
tain, however, that they are not 
human beings. Humanoids, yes; 
human beings, no.” 

“Convergent evolution, yes; Pro- 
fessor Camptargo, no,” muttered 
Riderson. “There go seven books 
and his reputation. As well as his 
credit with the accounting depart- 
ment which hired this ship. Perhaps 
a stronger word than vexed. I won- 
der if they’ll change the name to the 
‘Museum of comparative Ethnol- 
ogy’,” he mused. 

“We have other worries,” the 
ship replied primly. “Like im- 
plementation of our plan, for in- 
stance.” 

“By Zog’s sweet breath, what is 
this plan?” 

“Nothing you will be unable to 
handle, my dear Huntleader. At the 
least, it is the unsuspected subjuga- 
tion of the geo-political unit in 
which we find ourselves. At the 
most, merely the conquest of the 
planet.” 

“Oh,” said Riderson blankly. 
“Of course.” 

“The latter may prove unneces- 
sary,” the ship added. 

Six months later Riderson re- 
turned to the ship after an expedi- 
tion to Washington, where he had 

61 




planted semi-autonomous, self- 
camouflaging, psionic spy-sensors 
in the headquarters of the National 
Security Agency. 

The SpaceMaster-Scout was 
pleased. “Excellent. We are now 
tied into the largest computer and 
electronic information retrieval sys- 
tem in the world. Combined with 
our inputs to the Houston Space 
Center, we are now effectively 
linked to this world’s technological 
development.” 

“Spare me the details,” said 
Rider wearily. “Obviously you’re 
the brains and I’m just the brawn. If 
you had to drive one of these rattle- 
trap contraptions so laughably called 
auto-mobiles — ” 

“Relax, Hunt, everything is pro- 
ceeding according to plan.” 

“Well, I wish you’d let me in on 
it. Six weeks of driving around the 
country opening accounts in hun- 
dreds of banks just to end up with a 
lousy $2%, 000. Jeez.” 

“I am glad to see that you are al- 
ready beginning to think like a 
capitalist. But seriously, even 
$296,000 is an important sum of 
money if you consider it as yeast.” 

“So now we’re bakers,” said 
Riderson peevishly. “And what about 
the dangers of rampant inflation 
and the debasement of the currency? 
‘What good’s a molecular dupli- 
cator,’ I asked, “if we can’t just 
print up our own money and 
diamonds and gold?’ ‘Inflation; 
‘we want to subvert their economy, 
not wreck it,’ you answered. ‘Nuts, 

62 



in fact, peanuts,’ I reply.” 

“True, several hundreds of mill- 
ions could be introduced without 
significicant distortion although it 
would be extremely risky to do so 
with cash — but I was talking in 
terms of tens of billions .” 

“Oh.” Riderson pondered. 
“Well, just what are we going to 
do with this money?” 

“Such a question. Hunt. As good 
capitalists, we are going to make 
our money grow. Modestly at first, 
but inexorably. I think we shall 
shortly need a collection of 
passports; 1 would welcome your 
thoughts on their acquisition. And 
in the short term? We shall pur- 
chase a supermarket.” 

“A supermarket?” Riderson 
blinked and tugged at his still unac- 
customed earlobe. “Sure. What 
could be more logical in the con- 
quest of the world than a supermar- 
ket?” 

A year later he had to acknow- 
ledge the logic. Money was easy to 
come by with a molecular dup- 
licator in the tool room. Introducing 
large quantities of it into circulation 
was another matter. Especially since 
this particular government’s confis- 
catory tax collectors were suspicious 
of anyone possessing large amounts 
of cash. One means of introducing 
surplus cash into one’s books was 
to own a Nevada gambling hall; 
another was to own a combination 
supermarket-discount house pur- 
chased at a Houston bankruptcy sale. 

GALAXY 




The owner and manager of the 
store — a Mr. J. Major Clarkman — 
shook his head dolefully. Running 
an acre of store was hard work. 
Whoever said that work was uplift- 
ing? The only uplifting thing about 
it was at the end of the day when 
he duplicated the take — omitting 
checks, anything up to $20,000 — 
five times and then deposited the 
receipts in six different banks. 

From there to three banks in the 
Bahamas was a little trickier but 
feasible, and from the Bahamas to 
Switzerland no problem at all. 

The real problem was the 
betwixt-and-between state of this 
world’s technology. High enough to 
have invented double-entry book- 
keeping, the creditcard economy, 
the IRS Gestapo; low enough to be 
incapable of producing a simple 
main-dri.ve and gravitationless 
chamber for an old-fashioned 
SpaceMaster-Scout Mark IV. With- 
out some well-directed inspiration it 
would be three or four hundred 
years before this planet’s technology 
could effect the necessary repairs. 

J. Major Clarkman sighed and 
continued to feed $20 bills into the 
duplicator. Even with his longevity 
treatments, he’d still go home, if 
ever, with a long white beard and a 
fine set of the shakes. Unless, of 
course, he preferred to wait for res- 
cue within the statis field for 
17,000 years while a speed-of-light 
transmission was beamed back to 
the Museum by the nearly power- 
less ship. Assuming the Museum 

HIGH YIELD BONDAGE 



still existed 17,000 years from 
now. No, for the moment he 
would string along with the ship, 
playing boy-capitalist. 

A thought occurred to him. J. 
Major Clarkman grinned. What 
would the IRS and the bankruptcy 
courts think when eventually they 
got around to investigating his 
store’s six bank accounts? That he 
was a Mafia chieftain? A Presiden- 
tial fund raiser? 

He continued to grin. 

In June of ’75 Riderson was 
summoned back to the ship. He 
found two men sprawled at their 
ease in the salon. Before he could 
disentangle his eyebrows from his 
hairline the ship spoke. 

“Your brothers, Hunt, those 
extra hands I promised you some 
time ago.” 

“My broth — Oh. Clones. 
You’ve been growing them in the 
vat.” 

“Exactly.” 

“Well. .’’ he drew a long 
breath, scrutinized them closely. 
One was shorter than himself and 
darker, the other taller and thinner. 
By their facial traits they might 
have been his cousins. They re- 
turned his scrutiny with sardonic 
smiles. “They’re not very hand- 
some, but since you say they’re me, 
I guess that makes them fit for un- 
mixed company.” 

“A little genetic engineering,” 
said the tall one, “for identification 
only. It would be inconvenient in 
our dealings with this world, for us 

63 




to seem as identical as we are.” He 
yawned, punched for a drink. 

“Before we go any further,” said 
the short one, “I suggest we baptize 
ourselves. Even among ourselves 
three Huntleader Ridersons are apt 
to prove confusing.” 

“I agree,” concurred the ship. 
“In any event, Hunt One’s current 
role as J. Major Clarkman is about 
to end. Hunts Two and Three have 
been filled in with your personality 
and memories as of two months 
ago, the last time 1 recorded them. 
In a moment we’ll fill them in with 
events through today and then begin 
work on our new roles. You, Hunt 
One, will shortly become a certain 
Richard Erikson. Hunt Two is al- 
ready John W. Franklin of Mel- 
bourne, Australia, and Hunt Three 
is Russell C. vanPestel of Amster- 
dam. All three of you have ‘real’ 
identities, in the sense that people 
of these names were born to real 
Americans living overseas, who no 
longer have surviving parents or re- 
latives, and who all disappeared fi- 
nally and irrevocably from the face 
of the earth many years ago — as a 
surprisingly large number of the na- 
tives of this planet do each year. 

“Complete backgrounds and 
documentation covering the years 
since your namesakes vanished exist 
for all of you; you will all be able 
to withstand very careful examina- 
tions indeed. vanPestel and 
Franklin have been somewhat re- 
oriented for technological aptitudes 
and will concentrate primarily on 

64 



the engineering aspect, while Erik- 
son’ s main role will continue to J>e 
financial, although there will, of 
course, be a great deal of overlap- 
ping activity. Any questions?” 

There were many, but none that 
couldn’t wait until after dinner. In 
his scouting career among the stars, 
Riderson had already met death on 
three separate planets. Each time 
he’d been reanimated as an artifi- 
cially grown clone, complete with 
personality and memories. Only the 
fact that there were now three 
Ridersons rather than one lifted the 
situation above the prosaic. In ordi- 
nary situations it was illegal to dup- 
licate a living, functional person. 
He punched for a drink and began 
to discuss the menu with his two 
selves. 

In his persona as J. Major 
Clarkman, Riderson One returned to 
Houston, where he set about the 
liquidation of his affairs. The store 
was free of debt and doing business 
in excess of $300,000 per month. 
Riderson began looking for a pur- 
chaser. Eventually he received a cer- 
tified check for $1,525,000 which 
he regretfully disbursed without 
duplication throughout his banking 
system and thence to Switzerland. 

The accounts in the Houston 
banks were closed out, then the 
ones around the country and the 
three in the Bahamas, as all of 
Clarkman’s assets made their way 
to the anonymity of Geneva. From 
Geneva $4,142,849.63 was transfer- 

GALAXY 




red to Beirut, where it was used to 
purchase a varied portfolio of min- 
ing interests around the world from 
an expatriate American speculator, 
one Richard Erikson. 

J. Major Clarkman, perhaps for- 
tunately, was never destined to 
learn how unsound his business 
judgement was. On September 4th 
he rented a light plane, as had been 
his custom for a number of months, 
to pilot himself for a joyride over 
the Gulf of Mexico. It was an over- 
cast day but three shrimp trawlers 
clearly saw the craft disappear 
into the scudding clouds. Less than 
a minute later the plane reappeared, 
apparently in an uncontrollable 
dive. It smacked into the Gulf wa- 
ters and came apart in a thousand 
pieces. The trawlers searched for 
six hours and although bits of the 
plane were recovered, the body of 
J. Major Clarkman was never 
found. The few personal effects in 
his apartment were eventually dis- 
posed of by the State of Texas. His 
portfolio of worthless mining stocks 
was discovered in a Lebanese de- 
posit box 22 years later. 

Richard erikson arrived in 
New York in October, 1975, bear- 
ing with him letters of credit which 
he deposited at Chase Manhattan 
and First National City, $2,000,000 
in each. He confided jovially that 
after a life in the wilds amassing his 
grubstake as a mining speculator, he 
was now ready to start making 
some real money. The bankers 

HIGH YIELD BONDAGE 



smiled indulgently, as did the 14 
brokers with whom he opened ac- 
counts. Mr. Bamum’s famous adage 
was still unimpeachable a hundred 
years later. 

Initially, however, Mr. Erikson 
proved to be something of a sur- 
prise. He invested modest amounts 
in AT&T, IBM, GE, Xerox, and 
3M and seemed content to trade 
them back and forth, occasionally 
selling one short for no better 
reason than variety’s sake. By Feb- 
ruary, 1976, he was ahead of the 
game by perhaps $50,000, which 
amidst the pitfalls of the Street 
could be considered something of a 
triumph, but as it was all short-term 
taxable income rather than long- 
term capital gains, a rather slight 
one. He had, nevertheless, become 
well established as one of those 
rootless men of wealth whose sole 
occupation appears to be wandering 
from one brokerage firm’s ticker- 
tape to the next. 

But now his natural exuberance 
began to re-exert itself. 

He liquidated his holdings of 
blue-chip securities and possibly be- 
cause of his background in mining 
speculation became a mark for a 
couple of high-class international 
conmen specializing in the extrac- 
tion of wealth from the bowels of 
the earth. 

From Australia came a sharpy 
who demonstrated a process 
whereby he could extract the salt 
from sea water for no more than the 
cost of pouring the water over a 

65 




membrane. With a little money for 
additional research the extraction of 
gold and uranium would be forth- 
coming within months. Erikson 
wrote out a check for $200,000 to 
purchase a 50% partnership and to 
finance the acquisition of a research 
facility on the Oregon coast. 

From Amsterdam came another 
sharpy, one who had invented an 
automated process for cutting crude 
diamonds into polished gems at a 
fraction of the present cost. He was 
a plausible scoundrel, for he pre- 
sented as evidence of his bona fides 
bags of glittering stones from a 
Swiss deposit box, exact replicas, 
he claimed, of the lost treasures of 
Czar Nicholas. From the same box 
came other bags of raw diamonds, 
worth only a fraction of what their 
value would be as finished jewels. 
So consummate and audacious an 
artist was vanPestel that he even 
displayed a U.S. customs appraisal 
and receipt for duty paid. His eyes 
glittering with the dazzle of unim- 
aginable wealth, Erikson wrote out 
another check, this one for 
$500,000 and a partnership in The 
King of Diamonds, a store to be 
opened on Fifth Avenue. For his 
part, Mr. vanPestel would contri- 
bute as capital his stock of gems 
and raw diamonds as well as his 
yet-unseen automated gem- 
cutter. 

Having in his mind’s eye cor- 
nered the world’s market in gold 
and diamonds, Mr. Erikson set forth 
to do the same with oil. He opined, 

66 



apparently without outside assis- 
tance this time, that the next great 
oil strike would be made in the 
triangle formed by Grandfalls, Fort 
Stockton, and Girvin, Texas, an 
area that had been picked over and 
discarded by petroleum geologists a 
dozen times in the past. 

He caused to be purchased oil, 
gas, and mineral rights on 50 square 
miles of this worthless terrain by 
means of 99-year leases at an an- 
nual rate of $1 per acre, or $32,000 
a year, and 1/1 6th royalties on all 
revenues. The ranchers took his 
checks with straight faces, too 
well-mannered to snicker openly. 
Two weeks later, at astronomical 
cost, the first drilling rigs arrived. 
The first seven holes were dry, but 
Erikson insisted that they continue. 
He repurchased his 1/1 6f h royalties 
for $40,000 cash under the table. A 
million dollars disappeared in easy 
fashion. 

Had Mr. Erikson any friends, at 
this point they would surely have 
led him away. 

Simultaneous to these follies, he 
embarked on another, one that at 
least possessed the virtue of being 
marginly comprehensible to his ac- 
quaintances on the Street. 

In 1969 a small firm that made 
electronic components and precision 
optical instruments experienced a 
year of unusual prosperity. Their 
per-share earnings jumped from a 
traditional $0.25 to a breathtaking 
$1.85. They immediately split their 
stock, issued a public offering of 

GALAXY 




one million shares at $25 per share, 
and obtained a listing on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 

Unexpected prosperity and over- 
expansion into unrelated products 
were their undoing: there had fol- 
lowed six years of ever-increasing 
deficits. The company’s stock, 
which had once reached the dizzy 
height of 62, had four times been 
suspended from trading and was 
now selling at a modest IVz with no 
lakers. The only interest the Street 
retained in Virginia Videolec Inc. 
was a mild wonderment which would 
happen first, being struck off the 
Big Board or going into receiver- 
ship. 

For reasons best known to him- 
self, Richard Erikson began to take 
a position in VVI. There were 
2,250,000 shares outstanding; at 116 
a share, a measely $3,375,000 
would purchase the company lock, 
stock, and deficit. He began to 
place orders with his brokers, who 
now totaled twenty-seven, purchas- 
ing small amounts in the brokers’ 
names. VVI’s prospects were so 
bleak that no broker would allow 
him to purchase on margin, neces- 
sitating 100% payment. No bank 
would accept the stock as collateral 
for loans to buy additional stock. 
Erikson’s initial grubstake of 
$4,000,000 continued to melt away. 

The word spread quickly that a 
live one was loose in the Street. 
VVI doubled, to 3. Erikson con- 
tinued to buy. It went to 5. He 
frowned, but phoned in his orders. 

high yield bondage 



It jumped to 7 l A. He backed off and 
the price fell to 4-7/8 but continued 
to hover there. 

He scowled. Neither Franklin or 
vanPestel had their operations in 
full enough swing yet to permit the 
payment of dividends. He consulted 
with the ship, and $20,000,000 in 
Triple-A bonds, the bluest of the 
blue, GM, Exxon, AT&T, were 
carefully forged and surfaced from a 
deposit box in Geneva. He peddled 
them around to various banks, who 
were pleased to accept them as col- 
lateral for loans of 80% of their 
market value, the which were to be 
employed for business transactions 
only; the purchase of stocks with 
the said sums being a federal of- 
fense punishable by who-knew- 
whait. 

With 16 million at his disposal, 
he returned to the market. VVI shot 
to 12-1/8. Brokers now allowed him 
margin, only 30%, but it was better 
than nothing. To purchase a share at 
20, Erikson put up $14.00, the other 
$6.00 being advanced by the 
broker, who was loaning the money 
to Erikson and retaining the purch- 
ased share as collateral on his loan. 
If the price of the stock began to 
tumble, the broker would require 
immediate payment of the $6.00; if 
it was not forthcoming, the stock 
would be sold, hopefully before its 
value fell below 6. 

He persevered. 

On the West Coast John W. 
Franklin held a press conference, 
flying in at the company’s expense 

67 




a horde of skeptical science-writers 
and speculators, along with a retired 
conman and two internationally- 
known prestidigitators. He treated 
the assembled audience to a simple 
demonstration. 

A 10-inch pipe was run into the 
surf. Sea water was pumped 
through it and out the other end, 
undeniably salty sea water. He at- 
tached the pipe to an apparatus sus- 
pended by cables from a construc- 
tion derrick. An ordinary lamp cord 
ran to a portable 1.5KV generator. 
He pushed a button. Sea water was 
pumped from the ocean. Salt poured 
forth from one side of the ap- 
paratus, a 10-inch stream of pure 
drinking water from another. 

The audience was invited to find 
the trick. Tools were distributed for 
the purpose. Inside the gadget they 
found a membrane and a small 
motor to operate a sort of wind- 
shield wiper to remove accumulat- 
ing salt from the membrane. No 
hidden fresh-water lines ran down 
from the derrick or up invisibly 
from the ground. 

The next morning observers from 
Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Israel 
appeared on the scene. They re- 
turned the following day with cer- 
tified checks, the smallest of which 
was for $17,000,000. As a gesture 
of good will Franklin had arranged 
for a fleet of helicopters to transport 
the crated units to Portland Interna- 
tional. 

Initial profit-taking of $6,000,000 
was telexed to Erikson in New 

68 



York, who used it to purchase the 
remaining 135,000 shares of VVI at 
an average price of 41-3/8. It had 
cost him over 24 million to purch- 
ase a company a hair’s breadth from 
bankruptcy, and he owed 16 million 
plus interest to bankers and 2 mill- 
ion plus interest to brokers. Any 
day now one of the bankers might 
think to check the serial number of 
his AT&T bond against the com- 
pany’s list of bondholders. 

Erikson sighed. If only he’d 
owned a company in the first place; 
the company could have made a 
stock offer to the owners of VVI, a 
$4 share of General Widget, say, 
for each $1.50 share of Virginia 
Videolec, Inc. The whole thing 
could have been snapped up for 
$11,000,000 of paper. Well, never 
no mind, he told himself, you now 
have your General Widget for your 
next acquisitions. It only remained 
to get the bankers and brokers off 
his back and to stave off the immi- 
nent collapse of VVI 

The following day Oregon 
Oceanographies, a partnership, was 
transformed into a corporation with 
10 million authorized shares, 9 mill- 
ion of which were subscribed to at a 
cost of $0.25 per share by Richard 
Erikson (4,480,000 shares), John 
W. Franklin (4,480,000 shares) and 
a Dutchman named vanPestel 
(40,000 shares). 

The Securities and Exchange 
Commission permits the formation 
of privately-owned corporations 
without filing for its approval if the 

galaxy 




corporation has less than 22 stock- 
holders. Oregon Oceanographies, 
Inc., offered for private sale 
500,000 of the remaining one mil- 
lion shares at a price of $50 per 
share, a brisk appreciation from the 
founders’ $0.25. Ten speculators 
surfaced, eager to invest $2,500,000 
each for the construction of new 
plant and equipment. The remaining 
500,000 shares, now worth 
$25,000,000 by this standard, were 
traded to the sole stockholder of 
Virginia Videolec for the 2,250,000 
shares of that moribund company. 
VV1 thus became a wholly owned 
subsidiary of OreOc. 

The World Bank loaned the 
drought-stricken nations of Central 
Africa $50,000,000 for the purchase 
of desalinization equipment and 
$400,000,000 for the construction 
of pipelines from the ocean. 
Richard Erikson found five addi- 
tional speculators now ready to pay 
$100 a share for the 500,000 he had 
just received in exchange for VVI. 
He pocketed his 50 million, used 20 
to pay off his brokers and bankers, 
and consigned his phony Triple-A 
bonds to the molecular disintegrator 
with a sigh of relief. 

The king of diamonds, in the 
meantime, had opened its doors to 
trade amidst an unprecedented 
amount of free hoopla by the 
world’s media, achieved by the 
simple tactic of giving away a mill- 
ion dollars’ worth of diamonds, one 
$100 diamond to the first 10,000 

high yield bondage 



people to walk past the shop. The 
National Guard was called out and 
fire hoses employed. Curiously 
enough, the windows of The King 
of Diamonds remained unbroken 
throughout the riot. The National 
Association of Jewelers, the Interna- 
tional Confederation of Diamond 
Merchants, and the Union of South 
Africa lodged vitriolic protests and 
began the first of hundreds of inves- 
tigations and court actions. 

Mr. venPestel was unruffled. 
“It’s like the death throes of the 
buggywhip manufacturers at the in- 
troduction of the automobile,” he 
told a reporter from the Wall Street 
Journal. “Automation has finally 
reached the jewelry trade. Take a 
raw diamond that’s worth $1,000. 
After being cut by a master 
craftsman, it’s sold for $5,000. 
How much of that intervening 
$4,000 do you think the master 
craftsman sees? There’s a bunch of 
them down on 34th Street. Poor old 
boys; I’ll hire them all to set the 
stones — if the South Africans don’t 
drop a bomb on me first.” 

“You think there’s some danger 
of that?” asked the reporter. 

“Certainly. I’m going to sell that 
raw $1,000 diamond for not $5000 
but $2,000, cut better than any man 
alive can do it. And I’ll still make a 
fair profit. The diamond and pre- 
cious stone market is about to go 
blooey and a lot of South Africa 
with it, good riddance to them. But 
first they’ll try to deny me the raw 
stones, then they’ll try to prove I’m 

69 




bringing them to the States illegal- 
ly.” He shrugged. ‘‘So let them 
try. I have my own sources of sup- 
ply from all over the world. Are 
they smuggled out of South Africa? 
Do 1 know? Do I care? 1 just buy 
them from middlemen, and I pay 
customs duty on all of them. I say 
nuts to the South Africans.” 

The man from the Wall Street 
Journal found Mr. vanPestel a re- 
freshing change from the usual run 
of moguls. ‘‘Assuming you survive 
assassination, of your character or 
otherwise, what are your plans?” 

VanPestel shrugged. ‘‘It’s early 
days yet, but I’m thinking of form- 
ing a little corporation, just a few 
stockholders, to open some 
branches in other cities. Then who 
knows, maybe go public, have my 
stock listed right up there on the 
Big Board with Texaco and all the 
others. ...” 

He winked disarmingly, gave the 
reporter a diamond, then returned 
alone to his impregnable stronghold 
at the rear of the store. He placed 
an uncut diamond into a softly 
humming machine. A beautifully- 
cut gem popped out. He smiled. He 
looked about, found a hefty 
one-pound tome issued by the South 
African Chamber of Commerce; 
South Africa, An Industrial Profile. 
He stuffed the book in. A pound of, 
cut diamonds spewed forth. He 
laughed aloud. 

The simple pleasures of the rich. 

Over the next two years the 

70 



deserts of the world began to 
bloom. Mile by dusty mile the Sa- 
hara was reclaimed; Israeli and Arab 
established the stupendous Three- 
Ocean Water Authority; two million 
Chinese were invited to immigrate 
to the heart of the Great Australian 
Desert and within 18 months were 
feeding two-hundred -million In- 
dians. 

The fortunes of OreOc and VVI 
bloomed concurrently. Except for 
handling the vast sums of money 
that poured in, the only difficulty 
was in concealing the fact that 480 
workmen, researchers, and scientists 
were not in actuality manufacturing 
anything. This is difficult to dis- 
semble in an enterprise in which 
annual sales are reaching three- 
quarters of a billion dollars by the 
end of the second year, but it is 
possible. 

With the purchase of all of VVI’s 
stock from Richard Erikson, OreOc 
became, in effect, a holding com- 
pany, and upon the transfer of its 
so-called production facilities for 
the desalinization plants to VVI, its 
sole source of revenue became the 
dividends paid by its manufacturing 
subsidiary. To justify the initial 
stock sale of $25,000,000, an 
enormous research plant was con- 
structed in Oregon and most of the 
technical personnel and workmen 
from the Virginia factory sum- 
moned west. Here they were joined 
by 280 freshly hired researchers and 
scientists, all working under the di- 
rection of John W. Franklin in the 

GALAXY 




fields of molecular grouping and 
atomic theory. In a desultory fash- 
ion, bits and pieces of desalinization 
plants were manufactured in fits and 
starts and shipped east for final as- 
sembly. 

In Virginia, 340 additional scien- 
tists and workmen were hired, most 
of whom were concerned with 
hologramic research. Additional bits 
and pieces of desalinization plants 
were manufactured in fits and starts 
and shipped west for final assem- 
bly. 

East and West met in St. Louis, 
Missouri, where bored workmen put 
together the bits and pieces and in- 
serted the essential membranes, the 
latter being delivered in haphazard 
fashion from both Oregon and Vir- 
ginia. The 15 speculators who had 
originally bought a 10% interest in 
OreOc were now so preoccupied 
banking their dividends that none of 
them ever insisted on seeing an ac- 
tual membrane production line in 
full operation. Being a privately- 
held corporation, no disgruntled 
stockholders or admonitory SEC of- 
ficials were in a position to demand 
an accounting, which was just as 
well, as the only membrane produc- 
tion line was the duplicator in the 
rear of Franklin’s office. 

It is marvellously facile to make 
money if there is no vulgar neces- 
sity of actually manufacturing the 
manufactured article. 

About the time that Franklin was 
ready to announce to a breathless 
world that cheap mineral extraction 

HIGH YIELD BONDAGE 



from sea water was now an 
economic possibility, one of the 
ship’s spy sensors reported that Is- 
raeli scientists would be able to 
produce their own membrane within 
six months. For the nonce it was a 
carefully-guarded state secret, a 
hangover from the days of the in- 
ternecine wars of the Mideast. 

Franklin smiled. It was the mo- 
ment to milk the membrane for the 
last drop. 

The production facility in St. 
Louis was expanded and incorpo- 
rated as Saltfree Industries, a sub- 
sidiary corporation, thenceforth to 
be the world’s sole manufacturer 
and distributor of OreOc’s desalini- 
zation plants. To the joy of Wall 
Street, the new company im- 
mediately went public. A 100 mill- 
ion shares were issued at 10, with 
40 million shares subscribed to by 
the parent company, OreOc. The 
other 60 million were snapped up 
the day of the offering and im- 
mediately rose to 35. 

OreOc thereby possessed nearly a 
billion and a half dollars worth of 
Saltfree Industries stock, which it 
promptly converted into cash by sel- 
ling through Swiss brokers. The 
price fell to 31, but not before 
OreOc had cash reserves in excess 
of a billion and a half dollars. It 
hired an additional 600 scientists. 

Israel announced its discovery 
and the stock fell to 4. 

The Riderson brothers sold it 
short all the way down and pock- 
eted another $200,000,000. 



71 




The SEC announced a massive 
investigation. 

OreOc hired 72 lawyers. 

Franklin continued to smile. 

The 14th dry well paid for itself 
and the 13 others when diamonds 
were discovered at a depth of 200 
feet in the middle of the Texas bad- 
lands. The world’s geologists 
snorted. If diamonds were ever 
mined in the United States outside 
of Arkansas, it would not be in 
Texas, and if it were in Texas, it 
would not conceivably be on 
Richard Erikson’s 32,000 acres of 
badlands. One of the more outspo- 
ken geologists (speaking from the 
legal sanctuary of Johannesburg) 
declared the discovery an obvious 
job of salting and suggested that the 
world follow with close attention 
just how Richard Erikson proposed 
to milk his sucker’s bait. 

The geologist’s worst fears were 
well-founded. 

The King of Diamonds, Inc., a 
privately-held corporation, with 
branches now in 600 U.S. cities, 
and cash reserves in Zurich of over 
$200,000,000, moved swiftly. Min- 
ing equipment arrived, an enormous 
plant began to spring from the 
Texas desert, armed guards patrol- 
led the perimeter, 200 scientists 
were hired for vaguely-defined pur- 
poses, and Russell C. vanPestel 
himself arrived to take up perma- 
nent residence in a prefabricated 
house. After an inspection of a has- 
tily-dug mine, he announced that 
henceforth all diamonds for his 600 
72 



stores would t»e produced solely in 
the Great State of Texas. The Gov- 
ernor and assorted dignitaries 
applauded. 

It might even prove, continued 
Mr. vanPestel, that a revolutionary 
new form of automated mining was 
possible. One of his scientists had 
some ideas about suppressing the 
charge on the electron, which, if 
feasible, might not exactly disinteg- 
rate matter so much as shove it 
aside, but in any case. His 
voice trailed away. He was not a 
technically-oriented person, he ad- 
mitted modestly. Others would un- 
derstand the consequences far better 
than he. 

The Governor nodded knowingly. 

Six months later the world was 
flooded with diamonds. The price 
tumbled by 85%. The rich and 
haughty abandoned diamonds for-sap- 
phires and rubies. The non-rich and 
non-haughty bought them by the mil- 
lions. 

750 more scientists arrived, and a 
town began to appear on Erikson’s 
acres. 

The first assassination teams fil- 
tered out of South Africa and the 
Congo, unlikely allies. 

Russell C. vanPestel survived the 
attempts with disdainful ease. 

To rub it in, he appeared on na- 
tional television and smiled a daz- 
zling smile. His 32 teeth had been 
replaced by 32 carefully-faceted, 
first-water, indestructable, matching 
diamonds. 200,000 dentists phoned 
their dental supply houses. 



GALAXY 




Brilgleem, a recently-floated, 
publically-owned corporation was 
the world’s only supplier of dental- 
diamonds. Its stock was at 2, rose 
rapidly to 24. On the sale of their 
holdings a few weeks later, Rider- 
sons I, II, and III banked a puny 
150 million. It was tantamount to 
stealing pennies from a blind man, 
but in a few months every penny 
would be needed. They were ap- 
proaching the moment of their fiTst 
major financial operation. 

John W. Franklin called another 
press conference, this one from the 
paneled majesty of his new board 
room, to report the development of 
economically-feasible extraction of 
magnesium, bromine, strontium, 
rubidium, copper, and other rare 
metals from the planet’s inexhausti- 
ble oceans. He gestured toward a 
pile^ of dully-glittering sand, 
shoveled carelessly into a corner of 
the room. 

“20 tons of gold, gentlemen, ex- 
tracted from a single cubic mile of 
sea water. At the unofficial Treas- 
ury price of $104 per ounce — in 
Geneva, I may add, on the free 
market it was $213 this morning — 
that comes to $104 multiplied by 
640,000 ounces, or $66,540,000. 
Wait!’’ he cried to the hastily stam- 
peding crowd of newspaper men, 
“that’s nothing compared to the 
other minerals. ...” 

But the journalists were already 
gone. 

Gold opened in Geneva at $184 
and towards the end of the day had 

high yield bondage 



plummeted to $73. Erikson, 
Franklin, vanPestel, and their as- 
sorted corporate structures began to 
buy. In Geneva, in Zurich, in 
Basel, they purchased over two bill- 
ion dollars worth of gold. 

The following day the fine print 
in Franklin’s press conference began 
to penetrate the world’s conscious- 
ness. To extract 20 tons of gold it 
was necessary to first process 4 bill- 
ion tons of ocean. Even with the 
controlled fusion plants that 
Franklin’s scientists now had the 
highest hopes of developing, it 
would make better economic sense 
to extract gold from the dirt in your 
own backyard. 

The price of gold immediately 
rallied to $196, at which point the 
Ridersons unloaded their holdings 
for 5 billion dollars. 

.... copper and other metals, 
yes. A major industrial effort was 
needed. OreOc Inc. was proposing 
a 2 billion dollar bond issue to fi- 
nance plant construction. The bond 
would yield 14% interest, with, and 
this was another revolutionary fea- 
ture, an automatic escalation of its 
par value geared to the cost of liv- 
ing, so that if inflation eroded the 
purchasing power of a 20-year bond 
from $1,000 to $500, it would be 
redeemed in 20 years at $2,000. 

If the SEC wanted to carry on its 
ridiculous vendetta against OreOc 
Inc. and refuse the proposed bond 
issue, it might be pointed out that 
Brazil possessed an enormous 
coastline, a modern industrial base, 



73 




and a deep interest in the possibility 
of harnessing nuclear fusion and the 
mineral wealth of the inexhaustible 
seas for the benefit of all man- 
kind. 

After a short, stormy interview 
with the President of the United 
States, the Chairman of the SEC 
bitterly tendered his resignation. 
OreOc’s 2 billion dollar bond issue 
was approved one month later, and 
although Standard & Poors rated it 
a high-risk Single-B value, it was 
over-subscribed before the day of 
issue and eventually came out at a 
premium of 111. 

The 2 billion was received by the 
treasurers of Worldwide Oceanog- 
raphies, Inc., a wholly-owned sub- 
sidiary of OreOc, and handled just 
as the SEC had feared. It shuttled 
back and forth in a labyrinth of 
banks, holding companies, escrow 
agents, underwriters, insurance 
companies. Treasury Bills, and 
Commercial Paper until it sub- 
merged for good in the waters of 
Lake Geneva. 

True, enormous plants were un- 
der construction, a fleet of ships 
was being laid down in the yards, 
2000 scientists had been hired, but 
had anyone aside from the 
SpaceMaster-Scout’s bookkeeper- 
in-training (its Primary Accountancy 
Cells were being held in reserve for 
more important duties) been able to 
disentangle this plate of spaghetti, it 
would have become apparent that 
all these operations were being car- 
ried out with additional borrowed 

74 



money or from the companies’ daily 
cash flow. 

The moment had come. Reserves 
of 9 billion dollars stood ready. It 
was time to put the grubstake to 
work. 

It is easy to make money on Wall 
Street when the price of a share 
rises. You buy IBM at 300, sell at 
400, and pocket $100. 

It is just as easy to make money 
when the price of a share declines. 
You open a short account with your 
broker. You decide to sell AT&T 
short, betting that it will be selling 
for less next week than it is today. 

You tell your broker to sell 
AT&T short by 100 shares. Today a 
share costs $50. The broker finds 
another customer willing to buy 100 
shares of AT&T for $5,000, the go- 
ing price. You sell the other cus- 
tomer your shares and you receive 
his money. With one important re- 
servation. Your 100 shares will be 
delivered to the other customer one 
week from today, and at the same 
time your $5,000 will be paid over. 

You have sold shares of AT&T 
that you do not yet own. 

One week later AT&T is selling 
for $45. Your friendly broker ar- 
ranges for the purchase of 100 
shares for $4,500. You deliver your 
100 shares to the other customer, 
the broker pays you the agreed-upon 
$5,000. 

You have just made $500. 

If AT&T had fallen to 1, you 
would have made $4,900.

Identical orders from 2,731 
faceless customers to 2,410 brokers 
scattered around the world: “Sell 
Kodak, Bell & Howell, and 
Polaroid short.” The orders ex- 
ceeded 3 billion dollars, but this 
was a drop in the bucket compared 
to the combined market value of the 
outstanding stock of the three 
enormous corporations. 

Kodak was selling at 263, Bell & 
Howell at 91, Polaroid at 176. 

The next morning Richard Erik- 
son, Chairman of Virginia Vid- 
eolec, Inc., a firm which had virtu- 
ally disappeared from the public’s 
consciousness, exploded his bomb 
before an auditorium full of in- 
terested parties. 

He invited a grey-flanneled 
banker to mount to the podium. As 
the puzzled banker complied, Erik- 
son appeared to be tracking his 
progress with a small plastic box 
held in the palm of his hand, in ap- 
pearance rather like a photog- 
rapher’s light meter. By the time he 
reached the podium, Erickson was 
pointing it at his face from three 
feet away. 

“That’s enough, thank you.” 
Erikson swung around, pointed the 
gadget toward the empty stage. 
“Kindly observe.” 

Ten feet away a section of the au- 
dience suddenly materialized a few 
feet above the stage. A miniature 
grey-flanneled executive rose from 
its midst and began to walk for- 
ward. As he grew in size the 
background audience diminished. 
HIGH YIELD BONDAGE 



Eventually, there was nothing but a 
7-foot, 3-dimensional image of his 
head hovering over the stage. There 
was pandemonium in the audience. 

“Gentlemen, the entirely automa- 
tic holographic camera and projec- 
tor,” said Erikson with a smile. 
The noise increased. 

He raised an admonitory palm. 
“But wait: when thou hast done, 
thou hast not done, for 1 have 
more.” 

He thumbed a control. The image 
reversed itself until the banker was 
in the act of descending the stairs. 
It stopped. Erikson placed a sheet 
of paper between the projector and 
the image, moved it back and forth 
until he had framed a picture satis- 
fying to his aesthetics. He pushed 
another button, then handed the 
sheet of paper to the bemused bank- 
er. A high-resolution, full-color, 
3-dimensional picture of himself 
mounting the podium had re- 
placed the pristine blankness of the 
paper. 

“It is unfortunate,” deprecated 
Erikson when he could make him- 
self heard, “that this is a mere pro- 
totype and that production will only 
begin some indeterminate time in 
the future. ...” 

Nevertheless, Kodak fell to 174, 
Bell & Howell to 45, and Polaroid 
to 83. 

The Ridersons ordered their brok- 
ers to sell short a second time. 

V VI announced that on reconsider- 
ation production would begin im- 
mediately after all. 



75 




Kodak fell to 87, Bell & Howell 
to 19, Polaroid to 36. 

The Ridersons ordered their brok- 
ers to sell short a third time. 

VVI announced that their 
cameras would be priced between 
$7.95 and $39.95. Studio and 
theatre models would be somewhat 
higher. 

Kodak fell to 12, Bell & Howell 
to 3, Polaroid to 2. 

The Ridersons began to buy, but 
their full resources of 17 billion dol- 
lars weren’t needed. For a mere 3 
billion they purchased 20% interests 
in each company, then for 5 billion 
more an additional 20%, at which 
point they demanded and received 
new boards of directors. The new 
directors announced that Polaroid 
and Bell & Howell had negotiated 
exclusive licenses with VVI for the 
production of its camera and Kodak 
for the production of its miracle 
film. The price of their common 
stock rose by over 1000% and the 
Ridersons sold half their interests 
for 50 billion dollars. 

OreOc, the parent company of 
VVI, offered to trade 65% of its 
privately-held stock in exchange for 
the remaining 80% of publicly-held 
Kodak, Bell & Howell, and 
Polaroid stock. In a daze, stockhol- 
ders the world over accepted the 
tender. 

The Ridersons now owned plant 
and research facilities surpassing 
those of most of the world’s nations. 
Their cash reserves climbed past the 
80 billion dollar mark. 

76 



A scientist at OreOc’s lab- 
oratories announced that research 
into extraction processes hinted at 
the possibility of the age-old dream 
of transmutation. 

A scientist at The King of 
Diamonds Texas laboratories an- 
nounced that investigations into the 
behavior of the electron’s suppress- 
ed charge could conceivably lead 
directly to controlled fusion. 

Much as the aging John D. Roc- 
kefeller the First hired a public rela- 
tions man to soften his public im- 
age, the Ridersons’ various holdings 
chipped in 10 billion dollars to 
found a center of higher learning, 
the World University of the Physi- 
cal Sciences. Its School of Tachyon 
Behavior was endowed with an ad- 
ditional 3 billion. 

The ship arranged a conference 
call between Erikson, Franklin, and 
vanPestel. “A start has been 
made,” it reported, ‘‘particularly in 
the basic research needed to develop 
the necessary technologies. Tach- 
yons, fusion, transmutation to 
achieve continual creation of the 
transuranic elements. What is 
primarily lacking is gravitational 
control to bind the transuranic ele- 
ments and for the non-gravitational 
chamber which contains the drive 
unit. I can explain the theory, but it 
would be equivalent to explaining 
the theory of television to Leonar- 
do. Imagine the industries and 
technologies Leonardo would have 
to invent for the simple pleasure of 
watching “Gone With the Wind” 

GALAXY 




on his portable TV. We need more 
money, more power, more indust- 
rial base.” 



A SCIENTIST-SPOKESMAN at the 
combined Kodak-Polaroid labora- 
tories announced that they had 
succeeded in adding audio recording 
and playback to their cameras. 

John Franklin announced it was 
possible to beam a holographic im- 
age from one end of the world to 
the other. 

VVI put the two together and 
came out with a wristwatch-sized 
communicator which projected 
voice and image of the person cal- 
ling to the person called and vice 
versa. No telephone wires were 
needed, or central switchboards, 
and dialing was replaced by an or- 
dinary voice command to get, for 
instance, my pal Robert. Only if the 
caller knew two or more Roberts 
were there any difficulties. 
Electronically-augmented telepathy? 
VVI wasn’t saying. Where was the 
power source? An unpatented trade 
secret. 

They sold AT&T short all the 
way down from 74 to 3, then 
purchased outright the entire stock 
of the company with the highest as- 
sets of any corporation in the world, 
among which were the superb Bell 
Laboratories. 

It was also the most widely-held 
stock in the world. Its crash touched 
off the Great Plunge of ’82, and the 
spectre of the breadlines of the 
Great Depression became once 

HIGH YIELD BONDAGE 



again a possible reality. 

Holophones could also be used to 
replace television if the $29 model 
were purchased rather than the stan- 
dard $8. 

The Ridersons launched their own 
satellite network and bought up the 
remains of NBC, CBS, and ABC as 
well as RCA’s laboratories. 

No one in any of the companies 
purchased was thrown out of work. 
Some were given make-work jobs, 
others were re-assigned, others 
were essential. General Holophone, 
for instance, continued to bill its 
customers on a monthly basis, al- 
though only three people in the 
world knew that the SpaceMaster- 
Scout’s Primary Accountancy Cells 
were both the central switchboard 
and head bookkeeper for 200 mill- 
ion psionically-boosted holophones. 

The opprobrium of the FCC, the 
SEC, and the various state Public 
Utility Commissions was overcome 
when the holophone belonging to 
every federal, state, and municipal 
employee, from President down to 
city-hall janitor, simply failed to 
function for a three-day period. 

Outside the United States the 
Telephone and telegraph services of 
the world are generally government 
monopolies run by the postal au- 
thorities. Opposition to the introduc- 
tion of the American-controlled 
holophone was loud and adamant. 
40 million holophones were distri- 
buted by direct mailing free of 
charge to the world’s leaders. Their 
calls were not billed. Four months 



77 




later their holophones suddenly 
ceased to work. 

A researcher at Bell Labs built a 
primitive duplicator, suitable at any 
rate for duplicating holophones. 
Two weeks without holophones and 
the world’s leaders capitulated. 4 
billion holophones went into pro- 
duction and the American balance 
of payment- deficit was ended 
forever. 

“The next step,” said Erikson, 
“is going to be tricky. What- 
ever remnants of national sover- 
eignty and boundaries survive 
the holophone are going to be 
wiped out by our next gizmo. The 
Iron Curtain countries particularly 
are going to cut up rough.” 

“With reason,” said vanPestel. 
“I hereby predict the end of Com- 
munism within three years at most, 
and what I can predict, others can.” 

Franklin tugged at his earlobe. “I 
agree. We’d better take precaution- 
ary measures. We have full control 
of that Swiss armaments plant, 
don’t we? I suggest we work it, 
through them.” 

P UZZLED MILITARY OBSERVERS 
from every country in the world 
were invited to witness a demonstra- 
tion on an uninhabited speck of 
coral in the middle of the Pacific 
Ocean. A dour Swiss businessman 
in a black woolen suit sat uncom- 
fortably on a wooden chair in the 
full blast of the equatorial sun. A 
small apparatus hummed to itself 
beside him. From a ship 6 miles 

78 



away the observers were invited to 
observe a small rowboat which 
bobbed in the waves half a mile 
from the Swiss. But only through a 
specially polarized screen. A 20- 
kiloton nuclear device suddenly 
exploded in the rowboat. When the 
benumbed observers returned to the 
islet they found the dour Swiss 
looking impatiently at his watch, 
suffering from sunburn on his legs 
where he’d incautiously rolled up 
his trousers to expose his white 
shanks to the broiling sun. 

He returned to the mother ship, 
presented a pricelist for a wide 
range of forcefields guaranteed im- 
pervious to atomic explosion and 
radiation. He seemed to think that 
each of the world’s towns and cities 
were a likely buyer. The price, he 
pointed out, was modest. France, 
for instance, had spent 7 billion dol- 
lars in 1983 on arms and national 
defense. His firm would be happy 
to install a forcefield in every town 
in France with more than 500 in- 
habitants for only 7 billion 
dollars — one year’s armament 
spending. In a country such as An- 
dorra, which had spent nothing, the 
forcefield would be gratis. For the 
USA and the USSR? He shrugged. 
They should have reduced their 
arms budgets long ago. 

When the world’s cities had been 
fortified by the Swiss Peace- 
Profiteers as they liked to call them- 
selves, OreOc’s West Coast labs 
launched the grav-sled, and the 

GALAXY 




Ridersons acquired General Motors, 
Ford, Chrysler, American Motors, 
Boeing, MacDonald-Douglas, Pratt 
& Whitney and the rest of the 
aerospace industry. When the 
shockwaves hit the oil industry, Ex- 
xon, Gulf, Texaco, and the others 
followed. Petrochemically -produced 
plastic was necessary for the grav- 
sled bodies, and a reluctant but 
shell-shocked Justice Department al- 
lowed the merger of the petroleum 
industry with the automobile and 
aerospace industries to form a com- 
pany with assets superior to those of 
all but three of the world’s nations. 

The company was named, and 
this is true, General Hilarity, Inc. 

Why, as opposed to specific grav- 
ity, of course. 

Few people found the joke in 
good taste, especially the 3 million 
steel-workers in an industry which 
had just gone out of business. 

The basic 2-seater 80-MPH 
grav-sled was offered for sale 
within the United States for $999.99 
including Federal and state tax. 67 
million were sold the first year and 
the spectre of the Great Depression 
receded forever. 

Sales forces moved into Europe, 
Africa, and Asia, where stripped- 
down models were sold for as low 
as $249. They were unanimously 
refused permission to penetrate the 
Iron Curtain. The salesmen shrug- 
ged and turned away. 200 million 
orders were waiting elsewhere. 

When the world’s initial vora- 
cious demand had been slaked, 40 

high yield bondage 



million 300-MPH models appeared 
pilotless above the cities behind the 
Iron Curtain and floated down 
smoothly to a landing. 7 million 
were immediately confiscated by of- 
ficials. Of the remaining 33 million, 
21 million appeared two days later 
on the other side of the Iron Cur- 
tain, bearing with them 97 million 
people. 

2,541 hydrogen devices failed to 
detonate over the United States. The 
forcefield had been supplemented 
by a damper-field. 

The Congress of the United 
States declared war upon the Soviet 
Union and the People’s Republic of 
China. The Iron Curtain countries 
were attacked by 100 million un- 
armed, unpiloted grav-sleds, most 
of which had been drafted from the 
long-suffering American people. 
300 million Russians and Chinese 
bypassed the ragged tatters of the 
Curtain, and the war ended three 
days later. VanPestel had been 
wrong with his prediction. It had 
taken 3 years, 4 months, and 23 
days for the last Communist state to 
wither away. 

Worldwide, 357 billion dollars 
were scratched from armaments and 
invested in the production of hous- 
ing, food, and industry. The en- 
gineers at General Hilarity aug- 
mented the lift-capacity of the 
grav-sled by a power. The Ameri- 
can steel industry and 6 million al- 
lied workers were bodily moved to 
the Federated States of China; 27 
million Chinese left for Siberia to 



79 




begin the exploitation of the globe’s 
greatest storehouse of untapped 
natural treasure; 3 million Russian 
aerospace workers and engineers 
were invited to the United States by 
General Hilarity. Passports disap- 
peared. 

The King of Diamonds added an 
additional 27 acres of plant and 
laboratories to its Texas research 
center. 

OreOc placed on the market a 
device for extracting oxygen from 
rock. Its applications were expected 
to be limited. 

India increased the capacity of 
the industrial grav-haul to yet 
another power, mated it to a force- 
field, scooped up 200 cubic miles 
of Indian Ocean and 57 million In- 
dians, and announced from 
Gandhi-opolis-on-the-Grand-Canaf 
that the terraformation of Mars had 
begun. 

Worldwide per-capita income 
rose from $243 to $756 to $1,761 
to $3,937. A Japanese was elected 
President of the Directorate of 
Global Resources, the successor to 
the United Nations. Thirty-one mil- 
lion people were now working for 
Erickson, Franklin and vanPestel. 

Transmutation and controlled fu- 
sion were announced simultaneous- 
ly- 

Also the first tachyon probes were 
being launched toward the nearer 
stars. 

Components from around the 
world began to be delivered to The 
King of Diamonds, Inc. Under the 

80 



direction of the SpaceMaster-Scout, 
Ridersons I, II, and III installed and 
tested the new power unit. 

As soon as frill power was opera- 
tional, Riderson I had a short, acrid 
conversation with Professor 
Camptargo at the Museum of Com- 
parative Anthropology 17,000 light 
years away. 

“He curses us as ham-handed 
meddlers,” he explained to Rider- 
sons II and III, “as despoilers of a 
virgin paradise now unsuitable for 
serious ethnological study. 
He reviles us as selfish, egotistical, 
self-serving oafs unfit to represent 
the University in any capacity 
higher than bottlewasher. 

“He begs me to inform the 
SpaceMaster-Scout that had it 
wheels it might be suitable as a 
lawn-mower. He gives us 30-days’ 
notice and no letter of recommenda- 
tion. In brief, he’s given us the 
boot.” 

Riderson II grinned. “The Earth- 
lings are mounting their first expe- 
dition to Centauri next year. One of 
these days, when they land in the 
University football stadium he’ll be 
even less pleased.” 

“Talk, talk, talk,” admonished 
Riderson III. “Let’s get going be- 
fore the natives learn how we’ve 
despoiled their paradise.” He 
thumbed a button. 

The ship floated up through an 
empty warehouse and into the even- 
ing sky. It hovered for a moment, 
then it dwindled, diminished, and was 
gone. ★

I’m a sort of exception that 
proves the rule. 

And that, oddly enough, is my 
name — George Rule, currently mas- 
ter in the employ of the Dog Star 
Line, one of the few independent 
shipping companies in the Federa- 
tion able to compete successfully 
with the state-owned Interstellar 
Transport^ Commission. When I was 
much younger I used to be called, 
rather to my embarrassment, Golden 
Rule. That was when my hair, 
which I tend to wear long, and my 
beard were brightly blond. But, gi- 
ven time, everything fades, and my 
nickname has faded away with my 
original colouring. In uniform I’m 
just another tramp master — and the 
Odd Gods of the Galaxy know that 
there are plenty of such in the 
Universe! — and out of uniform I 
could be the man come to fix the 
robochef. It’s odd — or is it? — how 
those engaged in that particular 
branch of robotics tend to run 
to fat. 

But this exception business. 

The space services of the Rim 
Confederacy are literally crawling 
with officers who blotted their copy 
books in the major shipping lines of 
the Federation and various au- 
tonomous kingdoms, republics and 
whatever, and even with a few who 
left certain navies under big black 
clouds. The famous Commodore 
Grimes, for example, the Rim 
Worlds’ favourite son, isn’t a Rim 
Worlder by birth; he was emptied 
out of the Federation Survey Ser- 



vice after the discovery mutiny. (It 
was Grimes, by the way, who got 
me emptied out of Rim Runners, 
the Confederacy’s state shipping 
line, many years ago.) 

I am a Rim Worlder by birth. I’m 
one of the very few spacemen who 
was bom an Outsider and who now 
serves in the Insiders’ ships, the 
very opposite to all those Insiders 
who, for reasons best known to 
themselves, came out to the Rim. I 
was one of the first cadets to pass 
through the Confederacy’s space 
training college at Port Last, on Ul- 
timo. I started my space-going 
career as Fourth Mate of the old 
Rim Mammoth and then, after I 
gained my Second Mate’s Certifi- 
cate, was appointed Third Mate of 
Rim Tiger. Captain — as he was 
then — Grimes was master of her. 
He was a real martinet in those 
days. 

Now that I’m master myself I 
can appreciate his reasons for want- 
ing to run a taut ship. The affair 
aboard Discovery must still have 
been vivid in his mind and probably 
he was thinking that if he’d been 
less easy going the mutiny would 
never have happened. I didn’t take 
kindly to the sort of discipline that 
he tried to impose. Rim Mammoth 
had been a very happy ship; the 
Tiger was far from it. Looking back 
on it all, any Third Mate of mine 
who tried to get away with the 
things that I tried to get away with 
would get a rough passage and a 
short one. 



Anyhow — it was after I’d scrana. 
bled aboard at Port Fortinbras, very 
much the worse for wear, about t\y<j 
microseconds prior to lift-off— 4] 
was called into the Sacred Presencj. 
Before he could start on me I to 
him what he could do with his Su 
vey Service ideas. Then I told h 
what he could do with his ship, 
told him that I wasn’t at all st 
prised that Discovery’s officers h 
done what they did. And so on 

I don’t blush easily, but t 
memory of that scene induces a 1 
flush from my scalp to the tips 
my toes. I was lucky, bloody luci , 
not to have been pushed out throu i 
an airlock without a spacesuit. (Jl 
the time we were, of course, will 
on our way to Port Forlorn.) Oh, 1 
was escorted to the airlock after our 
landing on Lorn, taken to the Ship- 
ping Office and paid off, and told 
that it was extremely unlikely that 
Rim Runners would ever require my 
services again. 

But I was lucky: 

(a) I got a job. 

(b) I got a job that took me away 
from the Rim. 

(c) I got a job that exercised I 
certain civilizing influence (badly 
needed, I admit now) on me. 

You may remember when 
Trans-Galactic Clippers used to in 
elude the Rim Worlds in the itiner 
ary of their Universal Tours. One o 1 
their big ships — Sobraon — was in 
and her Fourth Officer, who had in 
curred multiple injuries in a rente c 
air car crash, was in hospital. Th c 



84 




post was mine, I was told, until 
such time as a regular TG man was 
available to relieve me. 

I took it, of course, hastily affix- 
ing my autograph to Sobraon’s Ar- 
ticles of Agreement before Captain 
Grimes could breathe a few unkind 
words into the ear of Captain Ser- 
vetty, who was to be my new boss. 
And it was with great relief that I 
watched, from the Clipper’s control 
room, the lights of Port Forlorn fad- 
ing below us as we lifted. I de- 
cided, then, to make the most of 
this second chance. I decided, too, 
that I’d not return to the Rim 
Worlds, ever. 

There was nothing to hold me; 
I was an orphan, and had never got- 
ten on with the various aunts and 
uncles on either side of my family. 
I’d had a girl, but she’d ditched me, 
some time back, to marry a wind 
turbine maintenance engineer. This 
broken romance had been one of the 
reasons — the main reason, 
perhaps — why I’d been such a pain 
in the neck to old Grimes. As the 
Universal Tour proceeded every- 
thing that I saw — the glamorous 
worlds such as Caribbea, Electra 
and all the rest of them — stiffened 
my resolution. The Rim Worlds 
were so dreary, and the planets of 
the Shakespearean Sector were little 
better. 

This was before Grimes, com- 
manding Faraway Quest, had dis- 
covered the worlds of what is now 
known as the Eastern Circuit — 
Tham, Mellise, Grollor and Stree. 

RIM CHANGE 



All that we had then were Lorn, 
Faraway, Ultimo and Thule — and, 
of course, Kinsolving’s Planet and 
Eblis. But nobody ever went near 
either of those. 

Sobraon knocked quite a few 
corners off me. There’s a saying 
that you often hear, especially in 
star tramps, that Trans-Galactic 
Clippers is an outfit where accent 
counts for more than efficiency. 
Don’t you believe it. Those boys 
may convey the impression of tak- 
ing a cruise in daddy’s yacht, but 
they’re superb spacemen. They play 
hard at times — but they work hard. 

I played with them — and I like 
to think that I pulled my weight 
when it was time to work. I was 
genuinely sorry when I paid off at 
Canis Major — Dogtown to we 
Sirians — the capital city of the Si- 
rian Sector. There was a new 
Fourth Mate, a Company boy, wait- 
ing for us there, so Captain Servetty 
had to take him on. He told me, 
though, that if I cared to fill in a 
TG Clippers application form he’d 
see to it that it received special con- 
sideration. I thanked him, of 
course, and I thought about it. I 
didn’t have to think very hard about 
the repatriation to the Rim Worlds 
to which I was entitled. I took the 
money in lieu and decided to treat 
myself to a holiday. 

It was while I was enjoying my- 
self at New Capri that I met Jane. 
She too was on holiday — on annual 
leave, as a matter of fact. She was 
at that time a Purser with the Dog 

85 




Star Line. It was largely because of 
her that I became a kennelman my- 
self; I became a naturalized Sirian 
citizen shortly after we married. She 
gave up spacefaring when our first 
child was on the stocks. 

Oh well, it’s nice having your 
wife aboard ship with you — but it’s 
also nice to have a home, complete 
with wife and children, to come 
back to. You can’t have it both 
ways. And most of the time I got 
ships that never wandered far from 
Dogtown, and was contented 
enough as I rose slowly — but not 
too slowly — through the ranks from 
Third to Second, from Second to 
Chief and, finally, from Chief Of- 
ficer to Master. 

But now, after all these years, I 
was coming back to the Rim. 

The dog star line ships spend 
most of the time sniffing around 
their own backyard, but now and 
again they stray. Basset had 
strayed, following the scent of 
commerce clear across the Galaxy. 
At home, on Canis Major, I’d 
loaded a big consignment of bras- 
sards and self-adjusting sun hats for 
Arcadia. I must find out some time 
how those brassards sold. They 
were made with waterproof pockets 
for smoking requirements, small 
change, folding money &c &c. The 
Arcadians, who practice naturism 
all the year round, have always 
seemed to manage quite well with a 
simple bag slung over one shoulder. 

86 



At Ursa Major (the Arcadians; 
have a childish love of puns) I filled 
up with the so-called Apples or 
Eden, a local fruit esteemed on : 
quite a few worlds. These were 
consigned to New Maine. And what 
would one load in Port Penobscot? 
Need you ask? Smoked and pickled 
fish, of course, far less fragrant 
than what had been discharged; 
This shipment was for Rob Roy, 
one of the planets of the Empire of) 
Waverley. I 

The cargo we loaded on Rob Royj 
was no surprise either. The Jaco-? 
beans, as they call themselves,! 
maintain that their whisky is 
superior to the genuine article distil- 
led in Scotland. It may be, it may 
not be; whisky is not my tipple. But 
the freight charges from the Empire 
of Waverley to the Rim Confeder- 
acy are far less than those from 
Earth to the Rim. 

So Basset had followed the scent 
of profit clear from the Dog 
Star to the Rim, and now it looked 
as though the trail was petering out. 
On the other legs of the voyage 
Head Office, by means of Carlotti 
radio, had kept me well informed as 
to what my future movements 
would be. On my run from Rob 
Roy to Lom they had remained si- 
lent. And Rim Runners, my agents 
on Lorn, had replied to my ETA 
with only a curt acknowledgement. 

1 didn’t like it. None of us liked it: 
we’d all been away from home too 
long. 

Probably I liked it less than my 

GALAXY 




officers. I knew the Rim Worlds; 
I could think of far nicer planets 
to sit around awaiting orders. 

We found the Lom sun without 
any trouble — not that we should 
have had any trouble finding that 
dim luminary. Even if we hadn’t 
been equipped with the Carlotti Di- 
rection Finder, and even if the Rim 
Worlds hadn’t been able to boast 
the usual lay-out of Carlotti 
Beacons, we’d have had no trouble. 
There’s the Galactic Lens, you see, 
and it doesn’t thin out gradually to- 
wards its edges; the stars in the spi- 
ral arms are quite closely packed. (I 
use the word “closely” in a relative 
way, of course. If you had to walk 
a dozen or so light years you 
wouldn’t think it was all that close.) 
And then there’s that almost abso- 
lute nothingness between the 
galaxies. Almost absolute. 

There’s the occasional hydro- 
gen atom, of course, and a few 
small star clusters doing their best 
to convey the impression that they 
don’t really belong to the galactic 
family. The Rim Confederacy is 
one such cluster. There are the 
Lorn, Faraway, Ultimo, Thule, Eb- 
lis and Kinsolving suns. To the 
Galactic East there’s a smaller clus- 
ter, with Tharn, Grollor, Mellise 
and Stree. To the West there’s a 
sizeable anti-matter aggregation, 
with a dozen suns. So, as long as 
you’re headed in roughly the right 
direction when you break out of the 
Lens, you have no difficulty iden- 
tifying the cluster you want.

You have the Galactic Lens 
astern of you. When the space-time- 
twisting Mannschenn Drive is run- 
ning it looks like an enormous, 
slowly squirming, luminescent 
amoeba. Ahead there’s an uncanny 
blackness, and the sparse, glimmer- 
ing, writhing nebulosities that are 
the Rim Suns seem to make that 
blackness even blacker, even 
emptier. And that emptiness still 
looks too damned empty even when 
the interstellar drive’s shut down 
and the ship’s back in the normal 
Continuum. 

I could tell that my officers were 
scared by the weird scenery — or 
lack of it. I was feeling a bit uneasy 
myself; it was so many years since 
I’d been out here. But we got used 
to it after a while — as much as one 
can get used to it — and here we 
were at last, dropping down through 
the upper atmosphere of Lorn. The 
landing was scheduled for 0900 
hours. Port Forlorn Local Time. We 
couldn’t see anything of Port For- 
lorn yet, although we had clearance 
from Aerospace Control to enter 
and were homing on the radio 
beacon. Beneath us was the almost 
inevitable overcast, like a vast 



87 





snowfield in the sunlight, and under 
the cloud ceiling there would be, I 
knew, the usual half gale (if not 
something stronger) probably ac- 
companied by rain, snow, hail or 
sleet. Or all four. 

“How does it feel to be coming 
home, sir?” asked my Chief Of- 
ficer sarcastically. 

“My home’s in Canis Major!” I 
snapped. Then I managed a grin. 
“If you’ll forgive my being comy, 
home is where the heart is.” 

“You can say that again, Cap- 
tain,” he concurred. (He was re- 
cently married and the novelty 
hadn’t worn off yet.) 

I took a last, routine look around 
the control room, just to make sure 
that everybody was where he was 
supposed to be and that everything 
was working. Soon I’d have to give 
all my attention to the inertial drive 
and attitude controls and to the 
periscope screen; inevitably I’d have 
to do some fancy juggling with lat- 
eral and downthrusts. Rugged, 
chunky Bindle, the Chief Officer, 
was strapped in the co-pilot’s chair, 
ready to take over at once if I suf- 
fered a sudden heart attack or went 
mad or something. Loran, the Sec- 
ond, was hunched over the bank of 
navigational instruments, his long, 
skinny frame all awkward angles 
and the usual greasy black cowlick 
obscuring one eye. His job was to 
call out to me the various instru- 
ment readings if, for some reason, 
such data failed to appear on the 
periscope screen. Young Taylor, the 

88 



Third, an extraordinarily ordinary 
looking youth, was manning the 
various telephones, including the 
NST transceiver with which we 
were in communication with Aeros- 
pace Control. In most Dog Star 
Line’s vessels this was the Radio 
Officer’s job, but I had found that 
our Sparks, Elizabeth Brown (Betty 
Boops, we called her) was far too 
great a distraction. Even when she 
was wearing a thickly opaque uni- 
form blouse (she preferred ones 
which were not) her abundant 
charms were all too obvious. 

We fell steadily, the inertial drive 
grumbling away in its odd, broken 
rhythm, healthily enough. We drop- 
ped into the upper cloud levels, and 
at first pearly grey mist alternated 
with clear air outside our viewports. 
And then, for what seemed like a 
long time, there was only dark, 
formless vapour. The ship shud- 
dered suddenly and violently as tur- 
bulence took her in its grip. The 
changing code of the blips from the 
radio beacon told me that I was off 
course, but it was early yet to start 
bothering about corrections. 

We broke through the cloud ceil- 
ing. 

Looking into the screen, stepping 
up the magnification, I could see 
that there had been few changes 
during my long absence. The land- 
scape, as always, was grey rather 
than green, almost featureless, al- 
though on the horizon the black, 
jagged peaks of the Forlorn Range 
loomed ominously. There were the 

GALAXY 




wide fields in which were grown 
such unglamorous crops as beans 
and potatoes. There was the city, 
which had grown only a little, with 
the wind turbine towers and the fac- 
tory chimneys in the industrial sub- 
urbs, each smokestack with its 
streamer of dirty white and yellow 
vapour. Yes, it was blowing down 
there all right. 

And there was the spaceport, a 
few kilometers from the city. I 
could see, towards the edge of the 
screen, the triangle of bright red 
flashing beacons on the apron. They 
were well to leeward, I noted, of 
the only other ship in port. This, I 
had been told, was Rim Osprey. 
There would be enough clearance, I 
thought hopefully, although I won- 
dered, not for the first time, why 
Port Captains, with acres of apron 
at their disposal, always like to 
pack vessels in closely. I applied 
lateral thrust generously, brought 
the beacons to the exact centre of 
the screen. 

At first it wasn’t too hard to 
keep them there, and then we drop- 
ped into a region of freak turbu- 
lence and to the observers in the 
Port Forlorn control tower it must 
have looked as though we were 
wandering all over the sky. An an- 
noying voice issued from the NST 
speaker, “Where are you off to, 
Captain?” 

“Don’t answer the bastard!” I 
snarled to Taylor. 

1 had control of her again and, as 
We ll as maintaining a steady rate of 

R| M CHANGE 



descent, corrected the ship’s at- 
titude. We dropped rapidly and the 
numerals of the radar altimeter dis- 
play were winding down fast. I was 
coming in with a ruddy blush — but 
that, I had learned years ago, was 
the only way to come in to Port 
Forlorn. 1 said as much to Bindle, 
who was beginning to make ap- 
prehensive noises. “Try to drop like 
a feather,” I told him, “and you’ll 
finish up blown into the other 
hemisphere. .” 

1 heard Loran mutter something 
about a ton of bricks, but ignored 
him. 

There was little in the screen now 
but dirty concrete and the flashing 
beacons, marking the triangle in the 
centre of which I was supposed to 
land — but only when my stern 
vanes were below the level of the 
top of the control tower did I step 
up downthrust. The ship complain- 
ed and shuddered to the suddenly 
increased power of the inertial 
drive. 

I was beginning to feel smug — 
but what happened then wiped the 
silly grin off my face. I had been 
leaning, as it were, into the 
wind — and suddenly, as we came 
into the lee of the administration 
block, there was no longer any 
wind to lean against. Worse still, 
there was a nasty back eddy. I re- 
versed lateral thrust at once, of 
course, but it seemed ages before it 
took effect. The marker beacons 
slid right to the edge of the screen, 
right off it. Then, with agonizing 

89 




slowness, they drifted back, not far 
enough. 

But we were down. I felt the 
slight jar and the contact lights 
came on. I cut the drive. Basset 
trembled and sighed as she sagged 
down into the cradle of her tripedal 
landing gear, as the great shock ab- 
sorbers took the weight of her. With 
a steady hand — but it took an 
effort! — I fished a packet of Carib 
panatellas out of my breast pocket, 
struck one of the long, green cylin- 
ders and stuck the unlit end between 
my lips. (I almost did it the wrong 
way round, but noticed just in 
time.) I checked all the tell-tales, 
saw nothing wrong and ordered 
quietly, “Make it Finished With 
Engines.” 

Nobody acknowledged the order. I 
looked around indignantly. All three 
officers were staring out through 
one of the viewports. “Gods! That 
was close! Bloody close!” the Mate 
was muttering. 

I stared through that viewport 
myself. Yes, it had been close. 
Another metre over towards the 
administration block and one or 
other or our stern vanes would have 
torn down the side of the other 
ship, ripping her open like a huge 
can opener. I unsnapped my belt, 
walked a little unsteadily to join 
the officers at the viewport. We 
could look directly into our 
neighbour’s control room. A junior 
officer, the shipkeeper, was staring 
across at us. His face was still 
white. It had reason to be.

“Port Forlorn Control to Bas- 
set ,” came from the speaker of the 
NST transceiver. “Do you read 
me?” 

“Loud and clear,” I replied au- 
tomatically into the microphone. 

“Port Forlorn Control to Basset. 
You are far too close to Rim Os- 
prey. For your information, she is 
not a lamp-post.” ( Funny bastard, I 
thought.) “You will have to shift. 
Oh, by the way, you also destroyed 
two of our marker beacons when 
you set down. Over.” 

I shrugged. It’s a rare master who 
hasn’t rubbed out the occasional 
marker beacon. And, after all, 
they’re cheap enough. (But Rim 
Osprey wouldn’t have been cheap if 
I’d hit her. But I hadn’t hit her. So 
what? 

Finally, after the ground crew 
had set out new beacons, I tackled 
the ticklish job of shifting ship. I 
managed it with no damage except 
for a slightly dented vanepad and a 
long scratch on the concrete apron. 

( Straight as though drawn with a 
rule, the Mate remarked. I forgave 
him, but it wasn’t easy.) 

When we had reberthed to the l 
Port Captain’s approval Customs i 
and Port Health boarded to clear us ' 
inwards. Both officials were quite 
amazed to find that my place of 
birth, as shown on the Crew List, 
was Port Forlorn. They had to say, 
of course, that I had gone to the 
dogs. My Agent — Rim Runners’ 
Port Forlorn Branch Manager — 
made the same feeble joke. Finally 

GALAXY 



we got down to business. He said, 
“I’ve nothing for you at the mo- 
ment, Captain. My last instructions 
from your Owners were to try to ar- 
range some sort of charter for you 
locally. 

I told him, rather plaintively, 
“But I want to go home. .” 

He replied cheerfully, “But you 
are home. Lives there a man with 
soul so dead, and all that. Don’t 
you have friends or relatives here? 
And you were in Rim Rinners once, 
weren’t you?’ 

“I was,” I admitted. 

“Then you must know Commo- 
dore Grimes, our Astronautical 
Superintendent. He’s in Port Forlorn 
now, as a matter of fact. .” 

“The commodore and I didn’t 
part on the best of terms,” I said 
carefully. 

“Time wounds all heels,” he 
told me. “Shall I tell him you’re 
here?” 

“Perhaps not,” I said. 

“He’ll know anyhow, Captain. 
He always likes to look through the 
crew-lists of strange ships that come 
in here.” He laughed. “He could 
be looking for your name!” 

“I should have changed it when I 
changed my nationality,” I said. 
“But I doubt if he’ll want to see me 
again.” 

Oddly enough — or not so 
oddly — nobody went ashore that 
day. The weather was partly to 
blame; shortly after our final berth- 
ing a cold driving rain had set in. 

RIM CHANGE 



Too, all the way to Lorn I’d been 
telling everybody how drab and 
dreary the Rim Worlds are, and 
they must have at least half believed 
me. 

And then, after dinner that 
night, a little party started in the 
wardroom. We were all relaxing af- 
ter the voyage and we had a few 
drinks, and a few more, and 
then. You know how it is. And, 
as always, we finished up in full 
voice, singing our Company’s an- 
them. 

All the big outfits have one, 
usually some very old song with 
modern words tacked on to the an- 
tique melody. In the Waverley 
Royal Mail they have their own 
version of Fly, bonny boat, like a 
bird on the wing. In TG Clippers 
it’s one of the ancient Terran sea 
chanteys, Sally Brown. (Way, hey, 
roll and go!) Rim Runners have a 
farewell song from some old comic 
opera. ( Goodbye , I’ll run to find 
another sun/ Where I may find / 
There are hearts more kind than the 
ones left behind. ) 

And ourselves, the Dog Star 
Line? The choice is obvious. 

“How much is that doggy in 

the window? 

(Arf! Arf!) 

' 'The one with the great big 
glass eyes. 

“How much is that doggy in the 
window? 

' 7 think she looks ever so nice 

“I don’t want a Countess or a 
Duchess, 



91 




“I don't want an Empress with 
wings. .’’ 

(This, of course, a dig at the Waverley 
Royal Mail Line.) 

“I don’t want an Alpha or a Be- 
ta. ." 

(The two biggest classes of ship in the 
Interstellar Transport Commission.) 

‘ ‘Or any of those fucking 
things!’ ’ 

“How much is that doggy in the 
window? 

(Arf! Arf! Arf!) 

“The one with the Sirius look, 

“How much is that doggy in the 
window? 

“ Please put my name down in 
her book!’ ’ 

We were all happily arfing away, 
with a few yips and bow-wows, 
when the Mate noticed a visitor 
standing just outside the wardroom 
door. “Come in, come in!” he cal- 
led. “This is Liberty Hall! You can 
spit on the mat and call the cat a 
bastard! But. .” 

We took the cue and roared in 
unison, “Beware of the dog!” 

“That last,” remarked a voice, 
familiar after many a year, “makes 
a very welcome new addition.” 

I turned slowly in my chair to 
look at‘ him. At first I thought that 
the old bastard hadn’t changed a 
bit. 

Then I saw that his hair was 
grey now, matching his eyes, and 
that his face had acquired a few 
new wrinkles. Otherwise it was as it 
always had been, looking as though 
it had been hacked rather than 

92 



carved out of some coarse textured 
stone and then left out in the weath- 
er. His ears were the same promi- 
nent jug handles of old. 

“Don’t let me interrupt the party, 
Captain Rule,” he went on, slightly 
emphasizing the title. “I had some 
business with Rim Osprey, and then 
I thought that I’d call aboard here to 
see you. But it can wait until the 
morning.” 

I got to my feet, extended a 
slightly reluctant hand. He shook it. 
“Good to have you aboard, sir,” I 
said in the conventional manner. 
“Will you join us in a small 
drink?” 

He grinned. “Well, if you twist 
my arm hard enough. .” 

I introduced him around and 
found him a chair. If he was bear- 
ing no malice — and he had far more 
reason to than I did — then neither 
was I. He was very soon completely 
at home. 

Betty Brown — wearing one of her 
transparent shirts and a skirt that 
was little more than a pelmet — and 
Sara Taine, my Purser, sat- 
— literally — at his feet, getting up 
now and again to bring him 
savouries or to freshen his drink. I 
didn’t get that sort of service. I 
thought resentfully, and this was my 
ship. .He had a fine repertoire of 
songs and stories, far more exten- 
sive than any of ours. Well, he 
should have done. He had been 
around so much longer. 

At last he raised his wrist and 
looked at his watch. He said, 

GALAXY 




“Thank you for the party, but I 
must be going. 

“The night’s only a pup. Com- 
modore,” Bindle told him. 

“It was a bitch of a night when I 
came aboard,” he replied, “and 
probably still is. Raining cats and 
dogs. .” He laughed. “Your Dog 
Star Line brand of humour seems to 
be catching. .” 

“Just one more before you go? 
One for the road?” urged the Mate. 

“No. Thank you. I don’t want to 
find myself in the doghouse when I 
get home. Goodnight, all. Good- 
night. Goodnight. .” 

I saw him down to the after air- 
lock. 

He told me, “I’ll be seeing you 
in the morning. Captain Rule, if it 
is convenient.” 

“Would you mind answering a 
question before you go, sir? I asked 
him. 

“I’ll try. What is it?” 

“T’ve always rather suspected, 
sir, that you were instrumental in 
getting me that berth in Sobraon. 
After all, Captain Servetty didn’t 
have to take me, of all people. And 
he must have known why I was. 
available. .” 

“He did know, Captain. He 
asked me if he should sign you on. 
1 told him that you had the makings 
of a good officer, but that he’d have 
to keep a close eye on you.” 

I said, “If I hadn’t been such a 
self-centred puppy I’d have known 
that you were still getting over the 
Discovery business. .” 

RIM CHANGE 



He said, “Let’s forget about it, 
shall we? It was all so long ago, 
and so very far away. .” Sud- 
denly he looked old, then reco- 
vered, equally suddenly, his appear- 
ance of ageless strength. “Good- 
night, Captain Rule.” Our hand- 
shake, this time, was really sincere. 
“I’ll see you in the morning.” 
Wrapping his rather flamboyant 
cloak about his stocky figure he 
strode down the ramp, ignoring the 
wind and the rain, let himself into 
his squat, ugly little ground car, and 
then was gone in a flurry of spray.

anything like the ogre you made 
him out to be,” said Sara Taine 
when she brought me in my tea tray 
the next morning. “I’m looking 
forward to seeing him again. What 
time will he be coming aboard?” 

I said severely, “He’s married. 
Very happily, I believe.” 

She frowned. She had one of 
those thin, serious faces, under sleek, 
gleaming black hair, on which a 
frown sits rather well. She com- 
plained, “All the attractive men in 
my life are married. You, and Peter 
Bindle, and now your old pal 
Commodore Grimes. .” 

“What about the engineers?” I 
asked her. “What about the Second 
and Third Mates? Or the Quack?” 
“Them!” she snorted, then grin- 
ned softly, “If I wasn’t such a good 
friend of Jane’s. .” 

“Don’t tempt me, Sara. The way 
this voyage is dragging on I 

93 




shouldn’t require so very much 
tempting.” 

She had been sitting on the bed, 
sipping her own cup of tea. She got 
up, moved to a chair. “That will 
do, Captain Rule. As I’ve said, 
Jane and I are good friends. I want 
us to stay that way. But it is a pity 
that she has such archaic ideas 
about sex, isn’t it?” She put her cup 
back on the tray with a clatter, got 
up and went out of the bedroom, 
leaving me to deal alone with the 
business of getting up to face the 
day. 

Showered and dressed I made my 
way down to the wardroom for 
breakfast. There were no absentees; 
the Doctor had insisted that each of 
us take a neutralizer tablet before 
retiring. As you know, they’re very 
effective — but by the time you need 
them you’re in such a state you 
can’t be bothered to take them. 
That’s one of the beauties of having 
a party aboard ship; you have your 
own medical practitioner on hand to 
prescribe as required. 

Canvey, the Interstellar Drive 
Engineer, asked what everybody 
else was intending to ask. He got in 
first. “Was that only a social call 
last night, Captain, or did Commo- 
dore Grimes have any information 
about our next loading?” 

And then Terrigal, Reaction 
Drive Engineer, stated rather than 
asked, “He’s coming aboard again 
this morning, isn’t he?” 

I told them, “The Commodore is 
Rim Runners’ Astronautical 

94 



Superintendent, not their Traffic 
Manager. ” 

“But he still piles on a lot of 
gees, doesn’t he?” said Canvey. 

“I suppose he does,” I admitted. 
I helped myself liberally from the 
dish of Caribbean tree-crab curry on 
the table, hoping that it would taste 
as good as it looked and smelled. 
(It did. Sara was as good a cook as 
she was a purser, and even the most 
sophisticated autochef — which ours 
wasn’t — gives of its best only when 
imaginatively programmed.) I 
asked, “How is the crab holding 
out, Sara?” 

“It isn’t,” she said. “This is the 
last of it.” 

“I tried to make a tissue cul- 
ture,” put in Dr. Forbes, who was 
Bio-Chemist as well as medical of- 
ficer, “but it died on me. .” He 
looked more like a professional 
mourner than ever as he imparted 
the bad news. 

“Then I hope they send us home 
by way of Caribbea,” I said. 

“So there is a chance of our get- 
ting home,” persisted Canvey. He 
was one of those little, grey, earnest 
men who always seem to be persist- 
ing. 

“I’ll believe it when we crunch 
down in Dogtown,’’ said Porky 
Terrigal glumly, making sure of his 
second helping of the fragrant cur- 
ry- 

“You must have heard some- 
thing, Captain. .” went on Can- 
vey. 

“I’m just the Master,” I told 

GALAXY 




him- “Nobody ever tells me any- 
thing’’ 

Breakfast over, I went back up to 
m y quarters. Bindle brought me a 
morning paper; somebody in Rim 
Runners’ dock office had been 
thoughtful enough to send copies on 
board. I lit a cigar, skimmed 
through it. It was deadly dull. 
(Other people’s local rags are al- 
ways dull — but this, The Port For- 
lorn Confederate, had been my 
local rag once. .) I noted that Bas- 
set was listed in the Shipping In- 
formation column as having arrived. 
I noted, too, that the date of her 
departure was given as “indefi- 
nite”. I knew that already. 

I read that the Confederacy’s De- 
partment of Tourism was thinking 
about reestablishing the holiday re- 
sort on Eblis. I read about the 
Burns Night party that had been 
thrown by the Ambassador of the 
Empire of Waverley. Obviously he 
couldn’t have been waiting for our 
consignment of Waverley scotch. I 
read about the Rim Rules Football 
match between the Port Forlorn Pi- 
rates and the Desolation Drovers. I 
found it hard to raise any interest in 
the account of the game. Even 
when I had been a Rim Worlder 
myself I hadn’t been all that keen, 
and on most of the worlds of the Si- 
rian Sector the game is Old Associ- 
ation, the only real football. Finally 
I found the crossword. It wasn’t one 
of the cryptic variety, just a collec- 
tion of absurdly simple clues that a 
retarded child of five could have 

RIM CHANGE 



solved in four minutes. It only took 
me three and a half. 

There was a knock at the door. I 
threw the paper aside, got out my 
chair to welcome Commodore 
Grimes. 

He took the seat I offered him, 
pulled out of his pocket an ancient 
and battered pipe that looked as 
though it was the very one that he 
had always smoked when I last 
knew him. It smelt like it, too. Sara 
Taine came in with a tray of coffee 
things. She seemed disposed to 
hang around with flapping ears, and 
looked hurt when I told her, “That 
will be all, thanks, Sara.” 

Grimes said, “Quite comfortable 
quarters you have. Captain Rule.” 
“Yes,” I agreed. “Basset and 
her sister ships are an improvement 
on the Commission’s basic Epsilon 
design. We have our own yards 
now in the Sector, of course, and 
build our own vessels. .” 

“Passenger accommodation?” he 
asked. 

“I can take a dozen, in single 
berth cabins. More if people are 
willing to double up.” 

“Mphm.’’ He tooked at me 
through the cloud of acrid smoke 
that he had just emitted. I countered 
with a smokescreen of my own. 
“Mphm. You know, of course, that 
we have our own Survey Ship, 
Faraway Quest. ...” 

“I’ve heard of her, sir.” 

“Well, the Quest’s out of com- 
mission. Will be for some months 
yet. Oh, she’s old, I admit, but 

95 




even I didn’t know that there were 
so many things wrong with her until 
she came up for Survey. He re- 
lit his pipe, which had gone out, us- 
ing one of the archaic matches that 
he still affected. “You know Kin- 
solving’s Planet, of course?” 

“I know of it, Commodore. I’ve 
never been there.” 

“I have,” he told me. “Too of- 
ten. The things that have happened 
to me there shouldn’t happen to a 
dog. Well, the Port Forlorn Univer- 
sity wants to send another expedi- 
tion to Kinsolving. Normally I’d 
have been their bus driver, in 
Faraway Quest. But she, as I’ve 
told you, is grounded. And our 
Navy won’t lay a ship on for a 
bunch of civilian scientists, psychic 
researchers at that. And all of our 
merchant tonnage, the Rim Runners 
fleet, is heavily committed for 
months to come. Do you get the 
picture?” 

“I’m beginning to,” I admitted 
reluctantly. 

“Do I detect a certain lack of en- 
thusiasm, Captain Rule? I can’t say 
that I blame you. Oh, well, it 
shouldn’t be hard to arrange a char- 
ter whereby we man the ship with 
our own personnel, while you and 
your boys and girls are put up in 
hotels at the Confederacy’s ex- 
pense.” 

“I stay with my ship,” I told 
him. “And I’m pretty sure that all 
my people will be of the same mind. ” 

“Good. 1 was expecting you to 
say that. So. If the charter is 

96 



arranged — it’s not definite yet — 
you’ll be carrying half a dozen sci- 
entists, two qualified psionicists, the 
Kinsolving’s Planet Advisor and his 
wife. The Advisor is me, of course. 
Sonya — my wife — doesn’t like that 
world any more than I do, but she 
maintains that I’m far less liable to 
get into trouble if she’s along. .” 

“What is wrong with Kinsolv- 
ing?” I asked. 

“You’re a Rim Worlder born,” 
he said. “You know the stories.” 

Yes, I knew the stories, or some 
of them. Kinsolving had been col- 
onized at the same time as the other 
Rim Worlds, but the colonization 
hadn’t stuck. The people — those of 
them who hadn’t committed suicide, 
been murdered or vanished without 
trace — were taken off and resettled 
on Lorn, Faraway, Ultimo and 
Thule. 

They all told the same story — 
oppressive loneliness, even in the 
middle of a crowd, continuous acute 
depression, outbreaks of irrational 
violence and, every night, dreams 
so terrifying that the hapless col- 
onists dreaded going to bed. One 
theory that I remembered was that 
Kinsolving is the focal point 
of. .forces, psychic forces. 
Another theory was that around the 
planet the fabric of our Universe is 
somehow strained, almost to break- 
ing point, and that some of the al- 
ternate Universes aren’t at all pleas- 
ant by our standards. But you don’t 
have to go to Kinsolving to get the 
feeling that if you make an effort

you’ll be able to step into another

But it’s on Kinsolving that you 
know that no effort at all is neces- 
sary, that a mere sneeze would suf- 
fice to blow you out of the known 
Universe into. .Into Heaven? 
Maybe, but the reverse would be 
more likely. 

“Kinsolving,” said Grimes soft- 
ly, “is a sort of gateway. It’s 
been opened quite a few times, to 
my knowledge. I’d as lief not be 
involved in its opening, but. .” he 
shrugged. “it seems to be my 
fate always to be involved with the 
bloody planet.” 

There was a heavy silence, which 
I thought I’d better break. “The 
professional psionicists you men- 
tioned. ?” 

“Old friends of mine,” he told 
me. “Ken Mayhew. One of a dying 
breed. He was a Psionic Communica- 
tions Officer long before the Car- 
lotti System was dreamed of. He 
still holds his commission in the 
Rim Worlds Naval Reserve. And 
Clarisse, his wife. A telepath and a 
teleporteuse. Both of them know 
Kinsolving.” 

“And does this Mayhew,” 1 
asked, “still cart his personal 
amplifier around with him? I can 
remember the old-time PCOs and 
how they used to make pets of 
those obscene, disembodied dogs’ 
brains. .” 

“Ken used to keep his poodle’s 
brain in aspic,” said the Commo- 

RIM CHANGE 



dore, “but not any longer. He and 
Clarisse work as a team. She 
amplifies for him when he’s sending 
or receiving, and he for her when 
she’s teleporting.” 

“And the scientists? Any weirdos 
among them?” 

“Oddly, enough, no. They study 
psychic phenomena without being in 
any way psychic themselves. 
They’ve cooked up some fantasti- 
cally sensitive instruments, I under- 
stand, that can measure the slightest 
variations of temperature, atmos- 
pheric pressure, electrical potential 
and whatever. They have their own 
theory about Kinsolving, which is 
that the planet is actually haunted, 
in the good, old-fashioned way. 
And for a ghost to appear and speak 
and throw things around it must get 
energy from somewhere. A drop in 
temperature, for example, indicates 
that energy is being used.” He 
laughed, rather mirthlessly. “It 
makes a change from all the other 
ideas about Kinsolving — multi- 
dimensional universes and all the 
rest of it. .” 

“And what are your ideas about 
it, sir?” I asked. 

“Kinsolving,” he said, “is a 
world where anything can happen 
and almost certainly will.” 

The charter was arranged; our 
Canis Major Head Office was happy 
enough that profitable employment 
had been found for Basset. We, 
Basset’s crew, were not so happy. 
We were all a long way from home, 
and too long a time out, and this 

97 




excursion to Kinsolving would in- 
evitably delay our departure from 
the Rim Worlds for the Sirian Sec- 
tor. 

There was one slight consolation; 
we were not kept hanging around 
long on Lorn. One day sufficed for 
the discharge of our inward cargo. 
It was a matter of hours only to 
ready the passenger accommodations 
for occupancy. There was the 
routine overhaul of all machinery, 
which took four days, and while 
this was in progress extra stores 
were taken on and the crates and 
cases containing the scientists’ 
equipment loaded. On the morning 
of the sixth day the passengers 
boarded. 

Ken and Clarisse Mayhew I had 
already met at Grimes’ home, 
where he and Sonya, his wife, had 
had us all to dinner. Ken was a typ- 
ical telepath, one of the type with 
which I have become familiar in the 
days when the only FTL communi- 
cation between ships and between 
ships and planet-bases stations was 
through the PCOs. He was tall, in- 
clined to be weedy, with mousy 
hair, muddy eyes and an other- 
worldly appearance. Clarisse was 
another kettle of tea, not at all con- 
forming to the popular idea of a 
psionicist. She was a very attractive 
girl with brown hair and brown 
eyes, strong featured, although a 
mite too solidly built for my taste. 
Sonya Grimes, however, was the 
sort of woman for whom I could 
fall quite easily; tall and slim, with 

98 



a thin, slightly prominent nose and 
a wide mouth, remarkable violet 
eyes, sleek auburn hair. Her figure? 
She could have worn an old flour 
sack and made it look as though it 
had been imported at great expense 
from Paris, Earth. 

The commodore and his wife 
were guests in the control room dur- 
ing liftoff. Sonya was a spacewo- 
man, I had learned earlier, and al- 
though married to a Rim Worlder 
she still retained both her Federation 
citizenship and her Survey Service 
commission. Grimes, I could see, 
was just itching to get his own paws 
on the controls. (He had confided to 
me that, at times, he found the life 
of a desk-borne commodore more 
than a little irksome.) But he sat in 
one of the spare chairs, well out of 
the way, watching. I don’t think 
that he missed anything. Sonya was 
beside him. She laughed when we 
went through our own Dog Star 
Line ritual after the routine checks 
for spaceworthiness. 

The junior officer present — young 
Taylor, the Third — demanded in a 
portentiously solemn voice, “What 
is the Word?” 

We all roared in reply, “Growl 
you may, but go you must!” 

Sonya, as I have said, was 
amused. She whispered to her hus- 
band, “I’m beginning to find out 
why this company’s ships are called 
the chariots of the dogs. .” I 
knew what she meant. That Twen- 
tieth Century book, Chariots of the 
Gods, is still regarded as a Bible by 

GALAXY 




those people who believe in the Old 
Race who started all the present 
civilization extant in the Galaxy. 

Aerospace Control gave us clear- 
ance to lift, wished us bon voyage. 
We climbed into what was an un- 
usual phenomenon for Lorn, a clear 
sky. Soon the spaceport was no 
more than a huddle of model build- 
ings far below us, with three toy 
ships on the apron. ( Rim Kestrel 
and Rim Wallaby had come in be- 
fore our departure; Rim Osprey was 
due to leave, for the worlds of the 
Eastern Circuit, later in the day.) 

The little bitch was handling 
well. I took her up easily, not try- 
ing to break any records. I heard 
Sonya murmur, “George isn’t like 
you, John. He doesn’t show off us- 
ing his auxiliary reaction drive 
when there’s no need for it. .” 
Grimes replied with a far from ex- 
pressionless mphm. 

Lorn, with its wide, dreary (even 
in the sunlight) plains, its jagged, 
snow-capped mountains, diminished 
below us, became a mottled globe, 
grey-brown land, green-blue water, 
white snow. Still we drove upward, 
through and clear to the Van Al- 
lens. 

The inertial drive was shut down 
and the directional gyroscopes 
grumbled into life, swinging the 
ship about her axes, bringing her 
head around to point almost directly 
at the target star, the Kinsolving 
sun, a solitary spark in the empty 
blackness. On the ship’s beam 
glowed the iridiscent lens of the 

RIM CHANGE 



Galaxy, spectacular and, to those of 
us not used to seeing it from out- 
side, frightening. 1 steadied her up 
on the target, making a small allow- 
ance for drift. I restarted the iner- 
tial drive and then started the Mann- 
schenn Drive, the space-time- 
twister. 

As on every such occasion I vi- 
sualized those gleaming rotors spin- 
ning, precessing, fading s as they 
tumbled down the warped dimen- 
sions fading yet never vanishing, 
dragging the ship and all aboard her 
into that uncanny state where nor- 
mal physical laws held good only 
within the fragile hull. There was 
the long second of deja vu during 
which time seemed to run back- 
ward. 

Inside the control room col- 
ours sagged down the spectrum and 
perspective was distorted, and all 
sounds were as though emanating 
from a distant echo chamber. Then 
all snapped back to normal, al- 
though the thin, high whine of the 
drive was a constant reminder that 
nothing was or would be normal un- 
til we were at our destination. And 
there was nothing normal outside 
the ports, of course. Ahead the Kin- 
solving sun was a writhing, multi- 
coloured nebulosity, and on the 
beam the Lens was a pullulating 
Klein flask blown by a drunken 
glass blower. It looked as though it 
were alive. Perhaps it was alive. 
Perhaps only with the Mannschenn 
Drive in operation do we see it as it 
really is.

I dismissed the uneasy thought 
from my mind. I said to Bindle, 
“Deep Space routine, Mr. Mate.” 

“But who will keep the dog 
watches?” asked Taylor. 

“You’re all watchdogs,” I re- 
plied. 

“More of your ritual?” asked 
Sonya interestedly. 

“Yes,” I admitted, feeling ab- 
surdly embarrassed. “I suppose it 
does sound rather childish to an 
outsider. .” 

Grimes laughed. “1 remember 
one ship I was in when I was in the 
Survey Service. The cruiser Orion. 
We called her O’Ryan, of course, 
and everybody had to speak an ap- 
proximation to Irish dialect, and our 
song, just as Doggy In The Window 
is your song, was The Wearin’ Of 
The Green. .” 

“Still rather childish,” his wife 
said, but her smile took any sting 
out of the words. 

Grimes said, “Well, Captain 
Rule, are you coming down to meet 
the customers?” 

I said, “I suppose it’s one of the 
things I’m paid for.” 

The customers — the pas- 

sengers — were in their own sa- 
loon. Ken and Clarisse Mayhew I 
had already met, of course, the 
others, until now, had been no more 
than names on the passenger list. 
There was a Dr. Thorne — I never 
did get it straight what exactly he 
was a doctor of — and his wife. 

100 



They were Jack Spratt and Mrs. 
Spratt in reverse, he a bearded, 
Falstaffian giant, she a grey, wispy 
sparrow. There were two, almost 
identical young men; mousey, 
studious, bespectacled. Their names 
were Paul Trentham and Bill Smith. 
The two young women could have 
been their sisters, but were not. One 
was Susan Howard, the other Mary 
Lestrange. They were friendly 
enough — not that they overdid it. 

Sara, ever efficient, had seen to it 
that the bar in the saloon was well 
stocked. Thome took over as bar- 
man; the drinks soon dispelled the 
initial stiffness of this first meeting. 
I rather took to the leader of the ex- 
pedition and he to me. I felt that I 
would be able, without giving of- 
fense. to ask him a question that 
had been bothering me slightly. 

“Tell me. Doctor,” I put to him, 
“why don’t you have any mediums 
along? You have two psionicists, 
sure, but they are, essentially, 
communications specialists, and by 
communications I don’t mean com- 
munications with the dear departed.” 
He laughed, a little ruefully. 
“One thing that our researches have 
taught us is this. There are many, 
many phoney mediums. Even the 
genuine ones sometimes, although not 
always intentionally so.” 

“What do you mean, exactly?” 
“Look at it this way. A genuine 
medium is determined to deliver the 
goods. If the goods aren’t forthcom- 
ing, because conditions aren’t right, 
perhaps, then he or she would just 

GALAXY 




hate to disappoint the customers. 
Quite possibly subconsciously — but 
now and again consciously — fake 
results are delivered. The main 
trouble, I suppose, is that the aver- 
age medium doesn’t have it drum- 
med into him, all through a long 
training, that high standards of pro- 
fessional ethics must be maintained. 
A graduate of the Rhine Institute, 
however — such as Ken Mayhew — is 
bound by the Institute’s code of 
ethics. He is therefore far more reli- 
able than any medium.” 

‘‘But you do believe in 
spiritualism, don’t you?” 

‘‘I believe that there are haunt- 
ings. I believe that Kinsolving’s 
Planet is haunted. I — we — want to 
find out by whom. Or what.” 

“I seem to be spending my life 
finding out,” grumbled Grimes. 
‘‘But every time I get a different 
answer.” 

“Perhaps you’re a catalyst, 
Commodore,” suggested Mrs. 
Thorne. 

‘‘And perhaps Captain Rule is a 
dogalyst,” said Sonya. 

I tried to laugh along with the 
rest at the vile pun — jokes about the 
Dog Star Line are all right when we 
make them, but. 

The voyage was a relatively short 
one. It was like all other voyages, 
except that at the latter end of it we 
should not be landing at a proper 
spaceport with all the usual radio- 
navigational aids. There would be 
no bored voice coming from the 

RIM CHANGE 



NST speaker, talking us down. 
There would be no triangle of 
beacons to mark our berth on the 
apron. Come to that, there would be 
no apron. The spaceport had be- 
come a sizeable crater when some- 
thing had destroyed the Franciscan 
ship Piety a while ago. 

Grimes had brought his charts 
with him. Together we studied 
them. He advised me to make my 
landing in the old Sports Stadium, 
on the shore of Darkling Tarn, not 
far from the city of Enderston, the 
ruins of which stood on the east 
bank of the Weary River. Those 
colonists had shown a morbid taste 
in place names. That applied to 
all the Rim Worlds, of course, but 
Kinsolving took the prize for delib- 
erately miserable nomenclature. 

The commodore acted as pilot 
when we finally made our approach; 
he had been on Kinsolving before, 
more than once, and he possessed 
the local knowledge. I handled the 
controls myself, of course, but he 
was in the chair normally occupied 
by Bindle, advising. 

We were making an early morn- 
ing descent — always a wise policy 
when landing on a world without 
proper spaceport facilities. The 
lower the sun’s altitude, the more 
pronounced the shadows cast by ev- 
ery irregularity of the ground. Too, 
when an expedition arrives at sun- 
rise it has all the daylight hours to 
get itself organised. Left to myself, 
I’d have arrived when I arrived and 
not bothered about such niceties. It 

101 




was Grimes, with his years of Sur- 
vey Experience behind him, who 
had urged me to adopt Survey Ser- 
vice s.o.p. 

So we were coming down after a 
few hours of standing off in orbit. 
Already there was enough light for 
us to be able to make out details of 
the landscape beneath us. There was 
the Weary River — and with all the 
twists and turns it was making it 
was small wonder that it was tired! 
There was the Darkling Tarn — 
looking. Grimes said, like an oc- 
topus run over by a steamroller. 
Bindle loosed off the sounding rock- 
ets that, at Grimes’ insistence, had 
been added to our normal equip- 
ment. Each of them, in its descent, 
left a long, unwavering smoke trail: 
there was no wind to incommode 
us. 

Each of them released a 
parachute flare that drifted down 
slowly. As we ourselves dropped, 
the picture in the periscope screen 
expanded. We could see the city at 
last, a huddle of overgrown ruins. 
We could see the Stadium, an oval 
of green that was just a little lighter 
in tone than the near-indigo of the 
older growth around it. One of the 
flares had fallen just to one side of 
the sports ground and started a 
minor brush fire; the smoke from it 
was rising almost directly upwards. 

At least it would be easier land- 
ing here than at the proper 
spaceport on Lorn. .Grimes guess- 
ed my thoughts. “The ground’s 
level enough. Captain Rule,” he 

102 



told me. “Or it was, last time I was 
here.” 

“Any large animals?” I asked. 

“Just the descendants of the 
stock brought by the original col- 
onists. Wild pigs and cattle. Rab- 
bits. They’ll all have sense enough 
to bolt for cover when they hear us 
coming down.” 

In the periscope screen the 
ground looked level enough. I main- 
tained a slow but steady rate of de- 
scent, slowed it to the merest down- 
ward drift when there were only 
metres to go. At last the contact 
lights flashed on. 1 cut the inertial 
drive. The silence, broken at first 
by the sighing of the shock absor- 
bers and the usual minor creakings 
and groanings, was oppressive. I 
looked at the commodore. He nod- 
ded, and said, “Yes, you can make 
it Finished With Engines.” Before I 
did so I glanced at the clinometer. 
The ship was a little off the verti- 
cal, but only half a degree. It was 
nothing to worry about. 

“So we’re here,’’ whispered 
Sonya. “Again.” I didn’t like the 
way she said it. 

“Shore leave?” asked Bindle 
brightly. “Of course, we shall want 
an advance from the Purser first, 
sir.” 

“Ha, ha,” I said. “Very fun- 
ny.” I looked out through the view- 
ports. This didn’t look like a 
world on which there would be any 
need for money. It didn’t look like 
a world on which to take a pleasant 
walk. 



GALAXY 




Oh, the day was bright enough, 
and such scenery as was in view 
was pretty enough, in a jungly sort 
of way, but. It was as though a 
shadow was over everything, dim- 
ming colours and bringing a chill to 
the air that bit through to the very 
bones. The sunlight streaming 
through the viewports was bright, 
dazzlingly so, to the outer eye — but 
as far as the inner eye was con- 
cerned it could have been the rays 
of a lopsided moon intermittently 
breaking through driving storm 
clouds. I’m not a seventh son of a 
seventh son or any of that rubbish, 
and if I applied for admission to the 
Rhine Institute for training they’d 
turn me down without bothering 
with the routine tests, but I do have 
my psychic moments. 

A premonition of impending 
doom, I thought. I liked the feel of 
it. I thought it again. 

“If you don’t mind, Captain 
Rule,” said Grimes, “I’ll assume 
command until such time as we lift 
off again. The ship is still your 
charge, of course, but all extra- 
vehicular activities are my pigeon.” 

“As you please, sir,” I said a lit- 
tle stiffly. He was doing no more 
than to confirm, in front of witnes- 
ses, what had already been 
decided — but it was essential that 
my officers have no doubt as to 
who was boss cocky of the expedi- 
tion. “Your orders, sir?” 

“Please pass the word for every- 
body, ship’s officers and civilian 
personnel, to assemble in the ward- 
RIM CHANGE 



room for briefing. I shall just be 
repeating what I have told you all 
time and time again during the 
voyage — but this is a world on 
which you can’t be too careful. This 
is a planet on which anything might 
happen, and probably will.” 

I reached for the microphone and 
gave the necessary orders. 

The wardroom was crowded with 
everybody packed into it, but there 
was seating for everybody. Grimes, 
nonetheless, remained standing. He 
said quietly, “Of all of us here, 
only Commander Mayhew, Mrs. 
Mayhew, Commander Verrill and 
myself have set foot on Kinsolving 
before. .” 

Commander Verrill? I wondered, 
then realised that he meant Sonya. 

“As we have told you,” he went 
on, “this is a dangerous world, a 
very dangerous world. You have 
heard the story of what happened to 
the Neo-Calvanist expedition when 
an attempt was made to invoke the 
Jehovah of the Old Testament. I 
was among those present at the 
time, as was Mrs. Mayhew, and the 
crater where the spaceport used to 
be bears witness to the destruction 
of their ship. Piety. You have heard 
what happened when our own ex- 
pedition, a little later, tried to repeat 
that foolhardy experiment. That 
time there was only one victim — 
me. And then there was the landing 
made by the Federation Survey Ser- 
vice’s ship, Star Pioneer, aboard 
which Commander Verrill and my- 

103 




self were passengers. That time the 
pair of us got into trouble. .” 

“Of course,” Sonya said sweet- 
ly, “I wasn’t worrying myself sick 
about you the other times. .” 

“Mphm. Anyhow, this a smaller 
expedition, than the previous ones 
and I therefore insist that when ex- 
cursions are made from the ship 
there is to be no splitting up; no- 
body is to go wandering off by 
himself on some wild goose — or 
wild ghost — chase. Personal trans- 
ceivers will be carried at all times. 
Ship’s personnel, acting as escorts 
to the scientists, will be armed. 
Captain Rule and all of his officers 
hold commissions in the Sirian Sec- 
tor Naval Reserve and are trained in 
the use of weaponry. .” 

Ha! I thought. Ha bloody ha! I 
remembered, all too well, our prac- 
tice session at the Navy’s small 
arms range shortly before our lift 
off from Dogtown. “Miss,’’ the 
exasperated Petty Officer Instructor 
had said at last to Betty Boops, “if 
you really want to hurt anybody 
with that pistol creep up close and 
hit him over the head with it. .” 
And most of the rest of us including 
myself, weren’t much better. Only 
Sara, the Purser, made a fair show- 
ing. 

“Compared to the rest of you,” 
the P.O. had said, “she’s Annie 
Oakley.” He went on, turning to 
Betty, “And you, Miss, are Calam- 
ity Jane.” Sara had been quite 
pleased. 

Grimes continued, “You civilian 

104 



ladies and gentlemen are not to set 
foot off the ship without your. 
watchdogs. Is that understood, Dr. 
Thome?” 

“Understood, Commodore,” re- 
plied the scientist laconically. 

“Good. I don’t know about the 
rest of you, but my belly is firmly 
convinced that my throat’s been cut. 
I propose that we all enjoy breakfast 
before getting the show on the 
road.” 

There were, as a matter of fact, 
two shows to be gotten on the road. 
One was the small party leaving the 
ship on foot to poke around the 
stadium and its environs, the other 
one flew to the city in the pinnace 
that we had on loan from the Rim 
Worlds Navy and that we carried in 
lieu of one of our own boats, which 
had been left in Port Forlorn. Like 
any ship’s boat it was not only a 
spaceship in miniature but could be 
used as an atmosphere flier. Unlike 
a merchant-ship’s boat, it was 
armed, mounting a heavy machine 
gun, a small laser cannon and a 
rocket projector. 

Grimes and Sonya were in the 
boat party, as were Ken Mayhew, 
Dr. Thome, Rose, his wispy wife, 
Sara Taine and myself. Sara was 
pleased at having real guns to play 
with — somehow she had appointed 
herself Gunnery Officer of the 
pinnace — and was hoping that she 
would have a chance to use them. I 
was hoping that she wouldn’t. 

GALAXY 




We boarded the boat in its bay. 
The commodore took the controls, 
the rest of us disposed ourselves 
around the small cabin. The inertial 
drive unit grumbled into life and we 
lifted from the chocks and then, 
with the application of full lateral 
thrust, shot out through the open 
port into the bright sunlight. Grimes 
took us round the ship in an ascend- 
ing spiral. Bindle, who was mind- 
ing the shop, waved to us from the 
control room. We were close 
enough to see his envious expres- 
sion. 

Grimes levelled out, headed for 
the city. It was not easy to see from 
this relatively low altitude; when we 
had been looking down on it the 
street plan had been obvious 
enough, but from a height of a mere 
one hundred metres it looked only 
like an unusually lumpy piece of 
jungle in the distance. Oh, there 
were a few ruined towers, promi- 
nent enough, but they were so 
overgrown that they could have 
been no more than freak geological 
formations. 

I tried to enjoy the flight. I 
should have enjoyed it; the bright 
sunlight was streaming through the 
ports, the scenery over which we 
were skimming was unspoiled, I 
had enjoyed a good breakfast and 
my after-breakfast cigar was draw- 
ing well. And yet. For no reason 
at all — apart from a quite illogical 
feeling of unease — I kept looking 
aft. I noticed that the others — apart 
from Grimes — did so too. (But 

RIM CHANGE 



Grimes had his rear view screen 
above the console.) A fragment of 
half remembered verse kept chasing 
itself though my mind. How did it 
go? 

Like one that on a lonesome 
road 

Doth walk in fear and dread. 

And having cast a glance behind 

Durst no more turn his head. 

Because he knows a fearsome 
fiend 

Doth close behind him tread. 

Something like that, anyhow. 
And, in any case, there wasn’t any 
fearsome fiend in our wake. I 
hoped. 

Grimes tapped out his pipe and 
refilled and relit it for about the 
fifth time. Sara Taine checked, yet 
again, the pinnace’s fire control 
panel. (But could you shoot at 
ghosts? I wondered. Had anybody 
had the forethought to substitute 
silver bullets for the normal 
machine gun ammo?) Dr. Thorne 
cleared his throat and, speaking 
loudly to be heard over the irritable 
snarl of the inertial drive, asked 
Mayhew, “Do you feel anything, 
Ken?” 

“I suspect,” replied the telepath, 
speaking slowly and carefully, “that 
something out there doesn’t like 

us. .” 

“A normal state of affairs on this 
world,” grumbled Grimes. 

“Are there likely to be any man- 
ifestations, Commodore?’’ said 
Thome. 

“Anything, no matter how un- 

105 




likely, is likely here,” was the re- 
ply. 

Cheerful shower of bastards! I 
thought. 

Rose Thorne — people do tend to 
be given unfortunate names, al- 
though the lady’s parents couldn’t 
have been expected to know that 
she’d marry whom she did — had 
opened the case that she had carried 
aboard with her and was tinkering 
with fragile looking instruments. 
She was finding out, I supposed, if 
there were any variations in temper- 
ature, gravitational or magnetic 
fields or whatever. Presumably she 
discovered no anomalies. In any 
case, she said nothing. And Ken 
Mayhew had a very faraway look on 
his face, was staring into nothing- 
ness, a nothingness in which. 
something stirred. That was the im- 
pression I got. Cold shivers were 
chasing themselves up and down 
my spine. 

“Cheer up, George,” Sonya ad- 
monished me. “The first time here 
is the worst.” 

“Not for me it wasn’t,” grunted 
the commodore. “Although every 
time was bad.” 

“My first time was bad,” stated 
Sonya. 

We were over the outskirts of the 
city now, following a broad street 
through the cracked surface of 
which trees and bushes had thrust. 
On either side of us were the build- 
ings, creeper-covered houses with 
empty windows peering like dead 
eyes through the tangled greenery. I 

106 



found myself thinking of ancient 
graveyards — cemetaries in which 
the victims of massacre had been 
buried and commemorated, and 
then, after many years, forgotten. 
Something, disturbed by our noisy 
flight, scuttled below and ahead of 
us, finally diving into a doorway. 

‘‘Hold your fire, Sara,” said 
Sonya sharply. “It’s only a hen.” 
“Nothing wrong with roast chic- 
ken,” I said. “The fowl in the tis- 
sue culture vats has long since lost 
whatever flavour it had. .” 

“There wouldn’t have been much 
left for roasting if I’d let fly with the 
MG,” Sara told me. 

It was a feeble enough joke, but 
we all laughed nervously. 

We came to a sort of square or 
plaza. There was a group of 
statuary — once a fountain? — in the 
middle of it, but so overgrown that 
it was impossible to see if the fig- 
ures had been men or monsters. 
They looked like monsters now. 
Around the plaza were ruined tow- 
ers, their outlines blurred by what 
looked like — was, in fact — Terran 
ivy. Those colonists had brought a 
fair selection of Earth flora and 
Fauna with them, some of which 
had survived and flourished. 

Grimes set the pinnace down 
carefully, very carefully, selecting 
an area that did not have any sturdy 
bushes and saplings thrusting up 
through the paving. We landed with 
hardly a jar. Reluctantly, it seemed, 
he turned off the drive. We could 
hear ourselves think again. This was 

GALAXY 




not the relief that it should have 
been. The silence, after the 
arhythmic snarl and thump of the 
motor, seemed about to be broken 
by. something. By what? 

“Well,” said the commodore un- 
necessarily, “we’re here.” 

“You know the city,” said 
Thorne. ‘‘Wasn’t there — isn’t 
there — some sort of temple. .” 

“1 don’t want to go there again,” 
said Sonya determinedly. 

Grimes shrugged. “It’s as good a 
place to start our. investigations 
as any. After all, we are here to in- 
vestigate. .” he remarked. He 
turned to Mayhew. ‘‘You’re the 
psionicist, Ken. What do you 
think?” 

The telepath seemed to jerk out 
of some private dream, and not a 
pleasant one. “The temple. .” he 
murmured vaguely. “Yes. .. 1 re- 
member. You told me about it. .” 

“Where is this temple?” asked 
Thorne. 

“We shall have to walk,” 
Grimes told him. “It’s not on the 
plaza. It’s in a little alley. I’m 
not sure that I’ll be able to find it 
again. .” 

“I can lead you there,” said 
Mayhew. 

“You wouldl" muttered Sonya. 

So the telepath was picking some- 
thing up, 1 thought. He would home 
on it, as a navigator homes on a 
radio beacon. I was beginning to 
feel as the commodore’s wife was 
obviously feeling about it. Deciding 
to throw in my two bits’ worth I 

RIM CHANGE 



asked, “Shall we leave somebody 
to guard the pinnace?” Sara 
scowled at me. She was the obvious 
choice. She would be no more keen 
on going outside than any of us, but 
she most certainly did not want to 
be left alone. 

“It will not be necessary, 
George,” said Grimes. “We will, 
of course, notify the ship of our in- 
tentions. And Ken will maintain his 
telepathic hook-up with Clarisse. 
And, before leaving, each of us will 
leave his hand impression so that 
the outer airlock door can be locked 
after us. .” 

This we did. The door would 
now open if any of us placed either 
hand — or only fingertips — on the 
plate set in the hull beside the en- 
trance. One by one we jumped down 
to the mossy paving stones. There 
was an unpleasant dankness in the 
air in spite of the sunlight, a pene- 
trating chill. Yet, according to the 
thermometer that Mrs. Thorne pro- 
duced from her capacious shoulder 
bag, it was mild enough, a fraction 
over twenty six degrees, too warm 
for the heavy, long-sleeved shirts, 
long trousers and stout boots that 
we were wearing. 

Mayhew took the lead, with 
Grimes, projectile pistol in hand, 
walking beside him. Sonya and I, 
immediately behind, followed his 
example, although she favoured a 
laser hand gun. The Thornes fol- 
lowed us. Sara, carrying a sub- 
machine gun, brought up the rear. 
The telepath led us over the broken 

107 




pavement, deviating from his course 
as required to avoid clumps of 
bushes and the occasional tree, but 
heading all the time to where a 
wide street opened off the plaza. It 
looked more like some fantastically 
fertile canyon than a manmade 
thoroughfare. The leaves of the om- 
nipresent ivy glistened in the sun- 
light, glossy greens and a particu- 
larly poisonous looking yellow. 
There were other creepers too, na- 
tive perhaps, or importations from 
other worlds than Earth, but they 
were fighting a losing battle against 
the hardy, destructive vine. 

We walked slowly and cautiously 
into the wide street. It must have 
been an imposing avenue before the 
abandonment of the city, before 
burgeoning weeds blurred its 
perspective and obscured the clean 
lines of the buildings on either side 
of it. I tried to visualise it as it had 
been in its heyday — and succeeded 
all too well. Everything. flic- 
kered, flickered then shone with an 
unnatural clarity. I cried out in 
alarm as I stared at the onrushing 
stream of traffic into which we were 
so carelessly walking. A gaudy 
chrome and scarlet ground car was 
almost upon on us, the fat woman 
driving it making no move either to 
swerve or to brake her vehicle. I 
grabbed Sonya’s arm to drag her to 
one side, to safety. She cried 
out — and her sharp voice shattered 
the spell. Again there was the brief 
flickering and when normal vision 
returned I could see that nothing 

106 



was moving in the street save our- 
selves. There was no traffic, no 
homicidal ground car. But there was 
a low mound ahead of us looking 
like a crouching, green furred beast. 
Freakishly, the lenses of its head- 
lights had not been grown over and 
were regarding us like a pair of 
baleful eyes. And had I seen the 
ghost of the machine, I wondered, 
or of its driver? 

Sonya was rubbing her arm and 
glaring at me. The others had stop- 
ped and were staring at me curious- 
ly- 

“Did you see something, 
George?” asked Thome. 

I said slowly, ‘‘I saw this street 
as it must once have been, at its 
busiest. We were right in the mid- 
dle of the traffic, about to be run 
down.” I pointed at the derelict, 
almost unrecognisable car. “We 
were almost run down by. that. 
Or its ghost.” 

“The ghost of a machine?" de- 
manded Thome incredulously. 

His wife, looking at an instru- 
ment she had taken from her bag, 
said, “The graph shows a sudden 
dip in temperature. .” 

“But a machine ?” repeated the 
scientist. 

“Why not?” countered Grimes. 
“Life force rubs off human beings 
on to the machinery with which 
they’re in the most intimate contact. 
Ships, especially. And a car is, 
in some ways, almost a miniature 
ship. .” He turned to Mayhew. 
“Ken?” 



GALAXY 




The telepath replied, in a distant 
voice, “I. I feel. resent- 
ment. In its dim, mechanical 
way that thing loved its mistress. It 
was abandoned, left here to 
rot. .” 

“Did you see anything?” per- 
sisted Thorne. 

“I saw the same as George did,” 
admitted Mayhew. “But I knew it 
wasn’t. real.” 

We resumed our trudge along the 
overgrown street. Everybody, I 
noticed with a certain wry satisfac- 
tion, gave the abandoned car a wide 
berth. We walked on, and on, try- 
ing to ignore the brambly growths 
that clutched at our trouser legs as 
though with malign intent. 

“Here,” announced Mayhew. 

We could just make out the en- 
trance to a side alley, completely 
blocked with a tall, bamboo-like 
growth with tangled strands of ivy 
filling the narrow spaces between 
the upright stems. 

“Shall P” asked Sonya. 

“Yes,” said Grimes, after a sec- 
ond’s thought. 

While Sara watched enviously the 
commodore’s wife used her laser 
pistol like a machete, slashing with 
the almost invisible beam. There 
were crackling flames and billows 
of dense white smoke. Coughing 
and spluttering, with eyes watering, 
we backed away. I couldn’t help 
thinking that a fire extinguisher 
would have been more useful than 
most of the other equipment we had 
brought along. 

RIM CHANGE 



But only the bamboo burned; the 
surrounding ivy was too green to 
catch fire once the laser was no 
longer in use. At last the smoke 
cleared to a barely tolerable level 
and We were able to make our way 
forward. The embers were hot un- 
derfoot, nonetheless, but our boots 
were stout and the fabric of our 
trousers fireproof. 

We found the church. 

It was only a small building, 
standing apart from its taller 
neighbours. It was a featureless 
cube. Well, almost a cube. I got the 
impression that the angles were sub- 
tly, very subtly, wrong. Unlike the 
buildings to either side of it it was 
not overgrown. Its dull grey walls 
seemed to be of some synthetic 
stone. The plain rectangular door 
was also grey, possibly of uncor- 
roded metal. There were no win- 
dows. Over the entrance, in black 
lettering, were the words, TEMPLE 
OF THE PRINCIPLE. 

Grimes stared at the squat, ugly 
building. I could see from his face 
that he was far from happy. He 
muttered, “This is where we came 
in.” 

“This,” Sonya corrected him, 
“is where we nearly went out. .” 

They had told me the story dur- 
ing the outward passage. I knew 
how they had investigated this odd 
temple, and found themselves 
thrown into an alternate existence, 
another plane of being on which 
their lives had taken altogether dif- 
ferent courses. It had not been a 



109 




dream, they insisted. They had ac- 
tually lived those lives. 

“Something. .” Mayhew was 
muttering. “Something. But 
what? But what?' ’ 

“And what was the principle that 
they. er. worshipped?” asked 
Thorne, matter-of-factly. 

“The Uncertainty Principle. .” 
said Grimes, but dubiously. “You 
know, the funny part is that in none 
of t|ie records of the abandoned 
colony is there any mention of this 
temple, or of the religion with 
which it was associated.” 

“The worshippers must have. 
left,” Sonya said, “before the other 
colonists were evacuated.” 

“But where did they go?” asked 
Thome. 

“Or when,” said Mayhew. ‘To 
when, I mean.” 

Grimes filled and lit his pipe, 
then almost immediately knocked it 
out again, put it back in his pocket. 
He pushed the door. I was expect- 
ing it to resist his applied pressure 
but it opened easily, far too easily. 
He led the way inside the temple. 
The others followed. I was last, as I 
waited until I had raised Bindle on 
my personal transceiver to tell him 
where we were and what we doing. 
He — always the humorist — said, 
“Drop something in the plate for 
me. Captain!” 

1 was expecting darkness in the 
huge, windowless room, but there 
was light — of a sort. The grey, sub- 
tly shifting twilight was worse than 
blackness would have been. It ac- 

110 



centuated the. the wrongness of 
the angles where wall met wall, 
ceiling and floor. I was reminded of 
that eery sensation one feels in the 
interstellar drive room of a ship 
when the Mannschenn Drive is run- 
ning, the dim perception of planes at 
right angles to all the planes of the 
normal Space-Time continuum. 
Faintly self-luminous, not quite in 
the middle of that uncannily lop- 
sided hall, was what had to be the 
altar, a. sort of ominous coffin 
shape. But as I stared at it its planes 
and angles shifted. It was, I de- 
cided, more of a cube. Or more 
than a cube. A tesseract? 

Rose Thorne was pulling instru- 
ments out of her capacious bag. She 
set one of them up on spidery, tele- 
scopic legs. She peered at the dial 
on top of it. “Fluctuations,” she 
murmured, “slight, but defi- 
nite. .” She said in a louder voi- 
ce, “There’s something odd about 
the gravitational field of this 
place. .” 

“Gravity waves?” asked her 
husband. 

She laughed briefly. “Ripples 
rather than waves. Undetectable by 
any normal gravitometer. ” 

Thome turned to Grimes. “Did 
you notice any phenomena like this 
when you were here before, John?” 

“We didn’t have any instruments 
with us,” the commodore told him 
shortly. 

“And what do you feel Ken?” 
the scientist asked Mayhew. 

But the telepath did not reply. 

GALAXY 




Looking at him, the way that he 
was standing there, his gaze some- 
how turned inward, I was reminded 
of the uneasy sensation you get 
when a dog sees something — or 
seems to see something — that is in- 
visible to you. “Old. .” he whis- 
pered. “Old. From the time be- 
fore this, and from the time before 
that, and the time before and the 
time before. The planet alive, 
alive and aware, a sentient 
world. Surviving every death 
and rebirth of the universe. Sur- 
viving beyond the continuum. .” 

It didn’t make sense, I thought. It 
didn’t make sense. 

Or did it? 

His lips moved again, but his 
voice was barely audible. “Com- 
munion. Yes. Communion. .” 

He took a step, and then another, 
and another, like a sleepwalker. He 
paced slowly and deliberately up 
to — into — the dimly glowing tes- 
seract. He seemed to flicker. The 
outline of his body wavered, wa- 
vered and faded. Then, quite sud- 
denly, he was gone. 

The metallic click as Sara cocked 
her sub-machine gun was startlingly 
loud. I still don’t know what she 
thought that she was going to shoot 
at. I did know that in this situation 
all our weapons were utterly use- 
less. 

“We have to get Clarisse here,” 
said Grimes at last. “She’s the only 
one of us who’ll be able to do any- 
thing.” He added, in a whisper, “If 
anything can be done, that is. .” 

RIM CHANGE 




Wh had to go outside the temple 
before we could use our personal 
transceivers. Clarisse was already 
calling; she knew, of course. She 
was already in Basset’s second 
boat, which was being piloted by 
young Taylor. Grimes told him to 
try to land in the street just by the 
mouth of the alley. There were 
more obstructions there than where 
we had set down, in the square, but 
speed was the prime consideration. 
I walked, accompanied by Sara, to 
the proposed landing site, my trans- 
ceiver set for continuous beacon- 
transmission so that Taylor could 
home on it. 

We heard the boat — the inertial 
drive is not famous for quiet 
running — before we saw it. Taylor 
came in low over the rooftops, 
wasting no time. He slammed the 
lifecraft down to the road surface, 
crushing a couple of well -developed 
bushes and knocking a stout sapling 
sideways. I shuddered. I didn’t like 
to see ship’s equipment — especially 
my ship’s equipment — handled that 
way. The door midway along the 
torpedo-shaped hull snapped open. 
Clarisse jumped out. 

She brushed past us, unspeaking, 
ran into the alley, clouds of fine ash 
exploding about her ankles. Sara 
and I followed her. Clarisse hesi- 
tated briefly at the temple doorway, 
exchanging a few words with 
Grimes and Sonya, then hurried in- 
side. When the rest of us joined her 
we found her standing by the altar, 
motionless, her face set and expres- 

112 



sionless. In the dim Ight she looked 
like a priestess of some ancient re- 
ligion. 

Then she spoke, but not to any of 
us. 

“Ken,” she whispered, obviously 
vocalising her thoughts. “Ken. .” 
She smiled suddenly. She was get- 
ting through. “Yes. Here I 
ain. .” 

“Where is he?” demanded 
Grimes urgently. 

She ignored the question. Sud- 
denly, walking as Mayhew had 
walked, she stepped into that lumin- 
ous shape, that distorted geometri- 
cal, multi-dimensional diagram. We 
saw the outline of her body through 
her clothing, her shadowy bone 
structure through her trahslucent 
flesh, and. 

Nothing. 

Thome broke the stunned silence. 
“Did you observe the meter while 
all this was happening?” he asked 
his wife. 

You cold blooded bastard! I 
thought angrily, then realised that 
the scientists’ instruments might 
provide some clue as to what had 
happened. 

“No,” she admitted, then 
stooped over the gravitometer, pres- 
sed a button. “But here’s the 
print-out.” 

We could all see the graph as she 
showed it to him. There were the 
slight, very slight irregularities that 
she had referred to as gravitational 
ripples. And there were two sharp 
and very definite dips. The first one 

GALAXY 




must have registered when Mayhew 
disappeared, the second when 
Clarisse vanished. 

So It, whatever It was, played 
around with gravity. A sentient 
planet, I reflected, ought to be able 
to do just that. 

“Rose,” said Grimes, “watch 
your gravitometer, will you?” 

She shot him a puzzled look, but 
obeyed. The commodore brought 
something small out of his pocket. 
It was, I saw, a box of matches. 
He tossed it towards the tesseract. 
Nobody was surprised when it, too, 
vanished. 

“The field intensified,” reported 
the woman. “Briefly, slightly, but 
very definitely.” 

“So. .” murmured Grimes. 
“So what?” He turned to face us 
all. “We must get Ken and Clarisse 
out. But how?” 

Nobody answered him. 

Having waited in vain for a reply 
he continued. “Twice, while on this 
blasted planet, I’ve been shunted 
. elsewhere. Each time I got 
back. I still don’t know how. But if 
I could, they can.” He gestured to- 
wards the altar. “That thing’s a 
gateway. A gateway to where — or 
when ?” He addressed me directly. 
‘‘You’ve an engineroom gantry 
aboard your ship, George. And 
there are drilling and cutting tools 
in the engineers’ workshop.” 

“Yes,” I told him. 

“I’d like them here. Mphm. But 
there’ll be only a few metres of 
wire on your gantry winches. We 

RIM CHANGE 



could want more, much more. .” 

I remembered, then, something 
which had been a source of puzzle- 
ment to me for a long time. “In the 
storeroom,” I told him, “are two 
funny little hand winches, with reels 
of very fine wire. There’s a lot of 
wire. Nobody knows what those 
winches are for. But. 

“But they might come in handy 
now,” said Grimes, suddenly and 
inexplicably cheerful. “I think I 
know what those winches are — 
although what they’re doing aboard 
a merchant spaceship is a mystery. 
In the Survey Service, of course, 
we had things like them, for 
oceanographical work. 

“Your’re losing me, sir,” I said. 

“I could be wrong, of course,” 
he went on, “but I’ve a hunch that 
these will be just the things we 
need. I’d like one of them out here 
at once. The other one, I think, 
could be modified slightly. Your 
engineers can study the simple 
workings of it, and then fit it with a 
motor from your gantry. .” 

I suppose that he knew what he 
was talking about. Nobody else did. 

We went outside the temple to 
use our transceivers to get in touch 
with Bindle, back aboard the ship. 
Grimes put him in the picture and 
then gave him detailed instructions. 
As. well as the first of the odd little 
hand winches and the cutting tools 
he wanted a sound-powered tele- 
phone, with as much wire as could 
be found. 

Then the commodore and myself 

113 




went to the mouth of the alley to 
await the return of Taylor with the 
first installment of equipment. The 
boat came in at last and we boarded 
it at once and were promptly carried 
to the flat roof of the building. Un- 
der my watchful eye the Third Of- 
ficer made a very cautious 
landing — but that rooftop, by the 
feel of it, could have supported the 
enormous weight of an Alpha Class 
liner. We unloaded the tools and the 
reel of wire, then Taylor lifted off 
and returned to the ship. 

Grimes looked at the wire reel 
and laughed. He said, “And you 
really don’t know what this is, 
George?’ ’ 

“No,” I told him. 

“Was your ship ever on Atlantia?’ ’ 
“A few times, I think, but never 
when I was in her.” 

“And one of those times — 
probably the last time — she overcar- 
ried cargo,” went on Grimes. “And 
the good, Dog Star Line Mate 
buried those left-over bones in the 
back garden, thinking that they 
might come in handy for something, 
some time. This is a sounding 
machine, such as the Atlanteans use 
in their big schooners, and such as 
we, in the Survey Service, use for 
charting the seas of a newly discov- 
ered world. But our machines have 
motors.” 

“I thought that all sounding was 
done electronically,” I said. 

“Most of it is,” the commodore 
told me, “but an echometer can’t 
bring up a sample of the bottom. 

114 



Yes, this is a sounding machine. 
Armstrong Patent.” 

“Is that the make of it?” 

Grimes laughed again, obviously 
amused by my ignorance. I rather 
resented this. It was all very well 
for him; he was one of the experts, 
if not the expert, on Terran 
maritime history. And not only did 
he hold a Master Mariner’s Certifi- 
cate in addition to his qualifications 
as a Master Astronaut — he had ac- 
tually sailed in command of a sur- 
face vessel on that watery world 
Aquarius. 

“Armstrong Patent,” he said, “is 
the nickname given by seamen to 
any piece of machinery powered by 
human muscle. And they’re a weird 
mob, the Atlanteans, as you may 
know. They have a horror of auto- 
mation even in its simples forms. 
They pride themselves on having 
put the clock back to the good old 
days of wooden ships and iron men. 
But they do import some manufac- 
tured goods — such as this.” He 
looked at the dial set horizontally 
on top of the winch. “And there’s 
two hundred fathoms of piano wire 
here. That’s about three hundred 
and sixty five metres.” He pulled a 
cylinder of heavy metal from its 
clip on the winch frame. “And 
here’s the sinker. About ten kilog- 
rams of lead, by the feel of it.” 

“Oh, I see,” I admitted. (Well, I 
did, after a fashion.) 

“Mphm.” Grimes was studying 
the legs on which the machine 
stood, the feet of which were de- 

GALAXY 




signed so that they could be bolted 
to a deck. “Mphm. He 
straightened up, then walked to the 
edge of the flat roof. I followed 
him. There was no parapet. 1 stayed 
well back; I don’t suffer from 
acrophobia — I’d hardly be a 
spaceman if I did — but I always like 
to have something to hold on to. 
And it looked a long way down. 
The temple hadn’t looked all that 
high from the ground, but in its vi- 
cinity perspective seemed to be fol- 
lowing a new set of rules. 

Grimes was shouting down to his 
wife after a futile attempt to use his 
personal transceiver. Apparently the 
inhibitory field was as effective on 
the roof as inside the building. 
“Sonya, we want some timber. 
Yes, timber! Two good, strong 
logs, straight, each at least two 
metres long and fifteen centimetres 
thick. Yes, use your laser to cut 
them!’’ 

When she had gone, accompanied 
by the others, he determined the 
centre of the flat roof by pacing out 
the diagonals. Where these inter- 
sected he put down his precious pipe 
as a marker. I brought him the laser 
cutter — one with a self contained 
power pack. He held it like the 
oversized pistol that it resembled, 
directing the thin pencil of incan- 
descence almost directly downward. 

At first it seemed the surface of 
the roof was going to be impossible 
to cut; the beam flattened weirdly at 
the point of impact, spreading to a 
tiny puddle of intense light, dazzl- 

R| M CHANGE 



ingly bright even though it was in 
the full rays of the sun. And then, 
quite suddenly, without any 
pyrotechnics, without so much as a 
wisp of smoke, there was penetra- 
tion. 

After that it was easy. Grimes 
described a circle of about one 
metre diameter but left a thirty de- 
gree arc uncut. He switched off and 
put down the cutter, then retrieved 
his pipe. When it was safely back 
in his pocket he extended a cautious 
fingertip to the cut in the roof. He 
looked puzzled. “Cold, stone 
cold,” he whispered. “It shouldn’t 
be. But it saves time.” 

I fetched the pinch bar and we 
got one end of it under the partially 
excised circle, then levered up- 
wards. It came fairly easily, and did 
not spring back when the pressure 
was released. I took a firm hold on 
the smooth edge and held it while 
Grimes completed the cut. 

When the disc was free it was 
amazingly light, even though it was 
all of four centimeters thick. I put it 
to one side and we looked down. 

The altar — I may as well go on 
calling it that, although I was sure 
by now that it had no religious 
significance — was almost directly 
below us. Its alien geometry glim- 
mered wanly. I’d been expecting, 
somehow, to find myself looking 
down into a hole, a very deep hole, 
but such was not the case. It was 
just as we had seen it from ground 
level, a distorted construct of slowly 
shifting planes of dim radiance. But 

115 




we knew that if we fell into it we 
should keep on going. 

Somebody was calling. It was 
Sonya, back from her wood-cutting 
expedition. We went to the edge of 
the roof. She and Sara were carry- 
ing one suitable looking log bet- 
ween them, the Thornes another. 
She shouted, “How do we get these 
up to you?” 

Grimes did something to the 
winch handles of the sounding 
machine so that the wire ran off 
easily. He pulled as much as he 
needed off the reel, lowered the end 
of it over the edge of the roof to the 
ground. Sonya threw it around the 
first of the logs in a simple yet se- 
cure hitch. We pulled it up. It wasn’t 
all that heavy, but the thin wire bit 
painfully into the palms of our 
hands. TTien we brought up the sec- 
ond one. 

We used the laser cutter to trim 
the logs to square section, adjusting 
the beam setting carefully before 
starting work. We didnT want to 
cut the roof from under our feet. 
Then we arranged the two baulks of 
timber so that they bridged the cir- 
cular hole. We lifted the sounding 
machine and set so that it rested 
securely on the rough platform. 
Grimes shackled the heavy sinker to 
the end of the wire, left it dangling. 
“Mphm. .” he grunted dubiously. 
He had found, clipped inside the 
frame of the winch, a small L 
shaped rod of metal on a wooden 
handle. He asked, “Do you know 
how this works?” 

116 



I didn’t. I’m a spaceman, not a 
seaman. 

“This,” he told me, “is the 
feeler. Normally there’s a good lead 
from the sounding machine so that 
the wire runs horizontally from the 
reel to a block on the taffrail or on 
the end of the sounding boom. 
Whoever’s working it holds the 
feeler in one hand, pressing down 
on the wire — and he knows when 
the sinker has hit bottom by the 
sudden slackening of tension. Then 
he brakes. Obviously we can’t do 
that here. So you, George, will 
have to exercise a lateral pull with 
the feeler. Yell out as soon as you 
feel the wire go slack.” 

We took our positions, myself 
crouching and holding the feeler 
ready, he grasping both winch hand- 
les. He gave them a sharp half turn 
forward and the sinker dropped, and 
the wire sang off the drum. It was 
plain that we hadn’t found bottom 
on the floor of the temple. Out ran 
the gleaming wire, out, out. I 
heard Grimes mutter, “Fifty. 
One hundred. One fifty. .” 
And what would happen when we 
came to the end of the wire? 

It went slack suddenly. “Now!” 
I shouted as I went over backwards. 
Somehow I was still watching 
Grimes and saw him sharply turn 
the handles in reverse, braking the 
winch. When I scrambled to my 
feet he was looking at the dial. 
“One hundred and seventy three 
fathoms,” he said slowly. “One 
hundred and seventy three fathoms, 

GALAXY 




straight down. He grinned rue- 
fully. “That was the easy part. 
Gravity was doing all the work. The 
hard part comes now!” 

I didn’t know what he meant un- 
til we had to wind up all that length 
of wire by hand. We waited a little 
while, hoping that Mayhew and 
Clarisse would be able to attach a 
message of some kind to the sinker, 
and then we took a handle each and 
turned and turned and turned. The 
pointer moved anti-clockwise on 
the dial with agonizing slowness. 
We had both of us worked up a fine 
sweat and acquired blisters on the 
palms of our hands when, at long 
last, the plummet lifted slowly 
through the hole in the roof. There 
was more than just the sinker at- 
tached to the wire. There was a 
square of scarlet synthesilk that, I 
remembered, Clarisse had worn as a 
neckerchief at the throat of her 
khaki shirt. And knotted into it was 
the box of matches that Grimes had 
dropped into the altar. 

There was something wrong with 
it. It took me a little time to realise 
what it was — and then I saw that in 
order to read the brand name 
— PROMETHEUS — one would re- 
quire a mirror. 

The thornes had a pad and a 
stylus among their equipment. We 
used the sounding machine wire to 
bring these up to the roof, then at- 
tached them to the sinker and sent 
them down to wherever Mayhew 
and Clarisse were trapped. This 

RIM CHANGE 



time Grimes applied the brake when 
he had one hundred and sixty 
fathoms of wire down and walked 
out the rest by hand. Then we 
waited, Grimes smoking a pipe — his 
matches still worked in spite of the 
odd reversal — and myself a cigar. 
This would give the psionicists time 
to write their message and, in any 
case, we felt that we had earned a 
smoko. 

We thought of asking Sonya to 
use the boat that we had left in the 
plaza to bring others of the party up 
to the roof to lend us a hand, then 
decided that, for the time being, it 
was better to have them standing by 
on the ground. To begin with, there 
was the problem of radio communi- 
cation with the ship to be consi- 
dered. 

Our rest period over, we sweated 
again on what the commodore had 
so aptly called the Armstrong Patent 
machine. At last the sinker rose into 
view. Attached to it was a sheet 
torn from the pad. Grimes detached 
it carefully but eagerly, then 
grunted. Mayhew’s handwriting, at 
the best of times, was barely legi- 
ble, and a mirror image of his vile 
caligraphy was impossible. And no- 
body had a mirror. I suggested that 
Grimes hold the sheet of plastic up 
against the sunlight. He did so, then 
muttered irritably, “Damn the man! 
If he can’t write, he should print!” 

Squinting against the glare I 
looked over Grimes’ shoulder. At 
least, I thought, we should be 
thankful for small mercies; Mayhew 

117 




had written on only one side of the 
sheet. I could just make out: Safe, 
so -far, but no communication. It- 
the “it” was heavily underlined — 
will receive but not transmit. I can't 
get inside its mind. It wants to know 
about us but does not want us to 
know about it. It’s draining us. Can 
you get us out? 

(It took us far longer to read the 
message than it has taken you.) 

“This piano-wire is strong,” 
Grimes told me. “The weight of a 
human being is well below its safe 
working load, let alone its breaking 
strain. But I don’t fancy winching 
Ken or Clarisse — Clarisse espe- 
cially — up by hand.” 

I was inclined to agree. 

Grimes wrote a short note to 
May hew, using the reverse side of 
the sheet on which the telepath’s 
message had been penned. He 
printed in large block capitals, 
HELP BEING ORGANIZED. 
GRIMES. We sent it down attached 
to the sinker. 

And then Taylor appeared with 
additional equipment, bringing the 
boat down to a landing almost at 
the edge of the roof. Also with him 
were Thorne’s assistants — 
Trentham, Smith, Susan Howard 
and Mary Lestrange. The mousey 
quartet showed signs of pleasurable 
excitement. A few turns on the 
hand winch, I thought sourly, 
would wipe the silly grins off their 
faces. Betty was with them. She 
had brought a sound-powered tele- 
phone set, a large reel of light cable 

118 



and a tape recorder. And there was 
the second sounding machine, to 
which a motor from the engineroom 
gantry had been attached. Porky 
Terrigal, the Reaction Drive En- 
gineer, had come along with it to 
make sure that nobody mis-used his 
precious machinery. There were 
also thermo-containers of hot and 
cold drinks and boxes of 
sandwiches, a couple of coils of 
strong plastic line that Bindle had 
sent along thinking that they might 
come in useful (they did) and a 
spidery looking folding ladder that 
would give us access from the roof 
to the ground, and vice versa. 

The boat had to stay in position, 
as the power to the sounding 
machine winch would be fed from 
its fusion unit. Luckily the rooftop 
was wide enough to accommodate 
all the extra people and gear with- 
out crowding. Sonya and Sara came 
up to join the party, leaving the 
Thornes standing watch below. 

Grimes turned the four young 
scientists to on the hand winch. By 
the time they got the sinker up to 
roof level they had lost their initial 
enthusiasm. The message was easier 
to read this time. To begin with, 
Mayhew had taken the hint and 
printed the words and, secondly, 
Susan Lestrange produced a small 
mirror from her shoulder bag. It 
said: WOULD LIKE A LITTLE 
MORE TIME. CAN YOU SEND 
TELEPHONE? KEN. 

We sent the telephone, and with 
it some food and drink. Betty 

GALAXY 




hooked an amplifier up to the in- 
strument at our end of the line. We 
waited anxiously, far from sure that 
things would work. What if what 
had been happening to the written 
word also happened to the spoken 
word? Then, after what seemed an 
eternity of delay, we heard 
Mayhew’s voice. “Thanks for the 
tucker, John! It’s very welcome. All 
the others seem to have died of 
thirst and starvation. .” 

“What others?” asked Grimes. 

“Clarisse here,” came the reply. 
“Ken can’t talk with his mouth full. 
We’re safe, so far. But I’ll try to 
put you in the picture. It feels like a 
huge control room, like a ship’s, 
but much, much bigger. Only there 
are no controls as we know them, 
no banks of familiar instruments. 
This is a great, cavernous space 
with lights shifting and pulsing. 
We know that it all means some- 
thing, that it isn’t mere, random ac- 
tivity, but what? But whatl Main- 
taining stasis over uncountable mil- 
lenia. Staying put in Time and 
Space while the Universe around it 
dies and is reborn. .” A note of 
hysteria crept into her voice, 
“/r. It has sucked us dry, of all 
we know, even of knowledge that 
we did not dream that we owned. 

And now It isn’t interested in 
us any more. We can take our 
places with the. others. .” 

“What others?” demanded 
Grimes. 

May hew came back on the line. 
“There are bodies here. Not de- 

RIM CHANGE 



cayed but. dessicated. Sort of 
mummified. Some human. Some- 
. not. There’s. something not 
far from us with an exo-skeleton. 
Something not from this Universe. 
And there are two things like cen- 
taurs. The arthropod thing is 
holding a machine of some kind. 
It could be a complicated 
weapon. And there’s all the time 
the slow, regular pulse of the col- 
oured lights washing over every- 
thing, and there’s something that’s 
like a gigantic pendulum, but not of 
metal, but of radiance. I can feel 
it rather than see it. .’’He paused. 
“It’s like being a tiny insect in the 
works of some vast clock, only the 
wheels and the gears and the pen- 
dulum aren’t material. .” 

Clarissed cried, interrupting, 
“But can you imagine a clock tick- 
ing backwards?” 

Thome had climbed up the 'roof- 
top. He said, “I heard all that. We 
must try to bring up some. 
specimens.” 

“All that I’m concerned with,” 
Grimes told him, “is bringing our 
friends up.” 

“It would be criminal,” said the 
scientist, “to miss this opportuni- 
ty” 

‘‘It will be criminal,” said 
Grimes, “to risk two lives any 
further. How do we know that 
the. gateway will stay open? No; 
we get Clarisse and Ken out of there 
now." 

The wire of the hand-powered 
sounding machine had been reeled 

119 




in by this time and, under Grimes’ 
supervision, the one with the elec- 
tric motor was set up in its place. 
To the sinker the commodore at- 
tached one of the coils of light plas- 
tic rope. He said into the telephone, 
“You remember that book of mine 
you borrowed on bends and hitches 
and knots and splices, Ken? You 
should be able to throw a secure 
bowline on the bight with the line 
I’m sending down to you. Yes, 
you sit in it. .” 

“But can’t he send up something, 
anything, first?” pleaded Thome. 

“No, Doctor.” Grimes was 
adamant. 

“I overheard some of that,” 
came Mayhew’s voice. “/ think we 
should. That lobster thing, and the 
contraption it’s holding in its 
claws. I could carry it up with 
me. .” 

“Mayhew is speaking sense,” 
commented the scientist. 

There was a long wait. Then, 
“It’s heavy,” came the voice from 
the speaker. “Damned heavy. We 
can’t shift it. .” 

“Then leave it,” Grimes ordered. 
“The sinker and the plastic line are 
on their way down to you now. I’m 
using the electrically powered 
machine, so I’ll have you and 
Clarisse up in no time.” 

“You have two machines?” 
asked Mayhew. 

“Yes. Why?” 

“I’ll send Clarisse up first. Send 
the wire down again, and I’ll have 
made a sling with what’s left of the 

120 



line and put it round the. thing. 
Then you bring me up with the 
hand-powered winch, and you can 
use the stronger one to lift the 
specimen. .” 

“Well?” demanded Thome. 

“All right,” Grimes agreed reluc- 
tantly. 

’It took no time at all to extricate 
Clarisse. Grimes had sent Taylor 
down to the temple, accompanied 
by the two girl scientists, to pull her 
clear of the altar and then down to 
the floor as soon as she emerged. 
She joined us on the roof. I looked 
at her and tried to remember on 
which of her cheekbones that beauty 
spot had been. 

We sent the wire down again. 
Mayhew telephoned that he had the 
end of it, was making it fast to the 
sling that he had managed to get 
around the body of the weird alien. 
We then shifted the electric wjnch 
to one side, replacing it with the 
hand-powered one. Grimes was 
worried that the two sounding wires 
might become entangled, but the 
sinker dropped with the same speed 
that it had done on the prior occa- 
sions. 

Mayhew said that he was seated 
in the bowline and ready to come up. 
Trentham and Smith manned the 
winch handles. It was brutally hard 
work; the winch was not geared. 
After a while Grimes and I had to 
spell them. And then Thorne and 
Terrigal took a turn. Mayhew was 
bringing his end of the telephone up 
with him and was keeping us in- 

GALAXY 




formed. “Like swimming up 
through a sort of grey fog. .” he 
said. “I’m putting my hand out, but 
there’s nothing solid. I can see 
the other wire. I can touch that , 
but it’s all that I can touch. 
Looking up, I can see a sort of dis- 
torted square of white light. It’s 
a long way off. .” 

Yes, it was a long way. A long 
way for him, and a bloody long 
way for those of us who were doing 
all the work. I hoped that Dr. 
Thome was enjoying his turn at the 
winch; it had been his idea that a 
specimen be brought up. If he 
hadn’t insisted Mayhew would have 
been whisked to safety with the 
same speed as Claiisse. 

We heard Taylor’s shout from be- 
low at last, just as Mayhew himself 
reported that he was being lifted 
into the temple. We came back on 
the winch after the Third Mate had 
caught his swinging feet and was 
lowering him safely to the floor. 
Once he was out of his harness he 
came up the ladder to join us on the 
rooftop. 

Now that the operation was al- 
most over I realized, suddenly, how 
time had flown. It was almost, sun- 
set, and a chill breeze was blowing 
from the east. In a matter of min- 
utes it would be dark. Kinsolving 
has no moon and here, on the Rim, 
there would be precious little star- 
light. 

Grimes said, “I think we should 
defer any further operations until 
tomorrow morning.” 

RIM CHANGE 



Thome said, “But there are lights 
in the boat. A searchlight. .” 
Mayhew said, “John, do we 
want that. thing? I’ve a feeling 
that the gateway may be closing 
again, at any second.” 

“Oh, all right,” said Grimes re- 
signedly. He turned to me, “Let’s 
get the electric winch back on to the 
platform.” 

We did so. Then he told me, 
“It’s your equipment, George, op- 
erated by your personnel. Over to 
you.” 

I thought. You buck-passing old 
bastard! But what he had said made 
sense. I gestured to Terrigal at the 
winch controls, made the Heave 
Away! signal. The piano wire tight- 
ened. I looked over Terrigal’s 
shoulder and could see the pointer 
on the dial begin to move. I vis- 
ualised that bundle of- 
— something — being dragged across 
the floor of the. .Cavern? Control 
room? The winch hadn’t got the 
weight yet. 

Then it took the strain and almost 
coincidentally the sun set. The light 
breeze was chillier still and there 
was almost no twilight. Somebody 
switched on the lights in the boat, 
including the searchlight, which 
flooded the rooftop with a harsh, 
white radiance. The winch groaned. 
Terrigal complained, “I can’t be 
held responsible for any damage to 
the machinery. .” 

“Keep her coming!” I told him. 
I was more concerned about the 
baulks of timber upon which the 

121 




sounding machine was resting than 
with the machine itself. But en- 
gineers, in my experience, always 
tend to be slaves to rather than mas- 
ters of their engines. 

There was an acrid taint in the air 
from overheated metal and insula- 
tion and the wire, a filament of in- 
candescent silver in the searchlight 
beam, was beginning to sing. But 
the pointer on the dial was 
moving — slowly, slowly, but mov- 
ing. 

I asked, “Can’t you go any fas- 
ter?” 

“No, Captain. I’m on the last 
notch now. And I don’t like it.” 

“Better get people cleared away 
from here, George,” Grimes told 
me. “If that wire parts it’s going to 
spring back. .” 

“And what about mel" de- 
manded Terri gal. 

“If you’re scared. .” I began. 

“Yes, I am scared!” he growled. 
“And so would you be if you had 
any bloody sense. But I wouldn’t 
trust any of you on this winch!” 

All right, all right — I was scared. 
And it was more than a fear of a 
lethally lashing end of broken wire. 
It was that primordial dread of the 
unknown that has afflicted Man 
from his first beginnings, that 
afflicts, too, the lower orders of the 
animal kingdom. The darkness 
around the brilliantly lit rooftop was 
alive with shifting, whispering 
shadows. Most of our party, I 
noticed, had already taken refuge in 
the boat, a little cave of light and 

122 



warmth that offered shelter, proba- 
bly illusory, from the Ultimate 
Night that seemed to be closing 
around us. Only Grimes, Sonya, 
Sara and myself remained in the 
open — and, of course, Terrigal at 
the winch controls. 

The winch was making an eery 
whining noise. The smell of hot 
metal and scorching insulation was 
much stronger. And the wire itself 
was keening — and was. stretch- 
ing. Surely it was stretching. Surely 
that shining filament was now so 
thin as to be almost invisible. , 

“Enough!” ordered Grimes. 
“Avast heaving!” 

The engineer brought the control 
handle round anti-clockwise, but it i 
had no effect. He cried, “She won’t 
stop!” 

“Mr. Taylor!” shouted Grimes 
into the boat, “switch off the power 
to the winch!” 

“The switch is jammed!” came 
the reply. 

“She won’t stop! She won’t 
stop!” yelled Terrigal, frantically 
jiggling his controls. 

The light was dimming, sagging 
down the spectrum, and outlines 
were wavering, and frightened 
voices sounded as though they were 
coming from an echo chamber. The 
thin high keening of the overtaut 
wire was above and below and 
through all other noises. Sonya and 
Sara were wrestling with the power 
cable, tugging at it, worrying it like 
two dogs fighting over a bone, try- 
ing to drag it out of its socket in the 

GALAXY 




boat’s hull. It resisted all their ef- 
forts. 

“Let’s get out of here!” snapped 
Grimes. “Into the boat, all of 
you!” 

Terrigal abandoned his winch, 
but not before aiming a vicious kick 
at the control box. He scurried into 
the little airlock. The two women 
followed. Grimes and I made it to 
the door in a dead heat; he pushed 
me inside then followed hard after 
me. As soon as we were all in, 
Taylor, forward at the controls, 
slammed the inertial drive into 
maximum lift, not bothering to 
close the airlock doors first. We 
started to rise, then stopped with a 
jerk, heeling alarmingly to port. 
The power cable to the winch was 
holding us down. But it would soon 
part, I thought. It must part. It was 
only a power cable, not a heavy- 
duty mooring wire. 

It didn’t part. It. stretched. It 
shouldn’t have done, but it did. 
And we lifted again, slowly, with 
the inertial drive hammering like a 
mechanical riveter gone mad. I 
clung to the frame of the open door 
and looked down. I saw the sound- 
ing machine dragged up and clear 
from the circular hole in the roof, 
with the shining filament of wire 
still extending straight downwards. 

Terrifyingly the city around the 
temple was coming to life — but it 
w asn’t the city that we had 
explored. The human colonists had 
laid out their streets in a rectangular 
Plan; these streets were concentric 

RIM CHANGE 



circles connected by radial 
thoroughfares. And there were the 
tall, cylindrical towers, agleam with 
lights, each topped with a shining 
sphere. Unsubstantial they seemed 
at first, but as I watched they ap- 
peared to acquire solidity. 

Grimes saw it too. He shouted to 
Taylor, to Terrigal, to anybody who 
was close enough to the fusion 
generator to do something about it, 
“You have to cut the power to the 
winch! We’re dredging up the 
Past — and we shall be in it!” 

“Just show me how. Commo- 
dore!” cried the engineer. “Just 
show me how! I’ve done all that / 
can do — short of stopping the jen- 
ny!” 

And if he did stop the generator 
we should fall like a stone. If he 
could stop it, that is. 

An aircraft came slowly into 
view, circling us warily. It was 
huge, a cylindrical hull, rounded at 
the ends, with vanes sticking out at 
all sorts of odd angles. It was like 
nothing that I had ever seen and 
possessed a nightmarishly alien 
quality. There were tubes protruding 
from turrets that could have been, 
that almost certainly were guns, and 
they were trained upon us. What if 
the alien commander — I visualized 
him, or it, as being of the same 
species as the lobsterlike being whose 
body we had been attempting to 
recover — should open fire? What 
would happen to us? 

Nothing pleasant, that was for 
sure. 



123 





But we had weapons of our own; 
we could, at least, defend ourselves 
if attacked. Sara, I was sure, would 
enjoy being able to play with her 
toys. And Sara, I suddenly realized, 
was beside me in the cramped little 
airlock, holding her sub-machine 
gun. I said to her, “What use do 
you think that will be? What’s 
wrong with the heavy armament?” 

She replied obscurely, “1 can’t 
bring it to bear.” I couldn’t see 
why she couldn’t. That blasted fly- 
ing battleship was staying well 
within the arcs-of-fire of the laser 
cannon and the heavy machine gun, 
and a guided missile would home 
on her no matter where she was re- 
lative to us. 

Sara opened fire. Bright tracer 

124 



flashed out from the muzzle of the 
gun, but not towards the huge fly- 
ing ship. It may have been the first 
round of the burst that hit the power 
cable, certainly it was one in the 
first half dozen. There was an arc- 
ing sputter of blue flame and the 
boat, released from its tether, went 
up like a bat out of hell. 

And below us the weird city out 
of Time flickered and vanished. 

I TURNED TO GRIMES. “You Said, 
sir, that the things that happen on 
Kinsolving’s Planet shouldn’t hap- 
pen to a dog. And they shouldn’t 
happen, either, to respectable 
employees of the Dog Star Line.” 

He managed a grin, then went, 
“Arf, arf!” ★

UFO’S AND BIG SCIENCE 

Science fiction people, fans and been no exception; but last January 
professionals alike, tend to avoid the staid and stolid American Insti- 
the subject of “flying saucers.” Af- tute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 
ter all, we’re much more scientific included a panel on UFO’s in their 
than that! 13th Annual Aerospace Sciences 

I recall the first SF club meeting meeting. If the inheritors of the pro- 
I ever attended. It was in Seattle, fessional American Rocket Society 
and the group was called The (that’s what I joined, and by golly 
Nameless Ones. (They had a nasty I’ll wear my little red rocket — the 
habit of electing newcomers Presi- devil with the merger that wiped out 
dent at their first meeting, but that’s ARS!) can discuss UFO’s in the 
another story.) For some reason a normal language of dull science, 
reporter showed up, and the first maybe we SF dreamers ought to at 
question she asked was about “fly- least think about them, 
ing. saucers. ’ ’ The Nameless rather What really got me onto the sub- 
gruffly told her we weren’t in- ject, though, was the publisher of

The reaction was probably jus- columns for. He wanted a feature 
tified. After all, we were those on UFO’s. I took the assignment 
nutty people who wanted to go to with a certain degree of apprehen- 
the Moon, and in the 50’s that was sion. 

far out enough. How could we In my previous experiences, UFO 
claim space travel was respectable if enthusiasts were invariably wild- 
we were also saddled with flying eyed, generally insisted that I look 
saucers? at smudgy, ambiguous photos, and 

SF people have always tended to often revealed that the US Air Force 
shy away from UFO’s, and I’ve was engaged in a conspiracy to 

126 





suppress all knowledge about 
UFO’s. They told horror stories 
about Project Blue Book. They sol- 
emnly related that the US Govern- 
ment had constructed a secret 
laboratory in the Mojave, and 
seduced a famous UFO investigator 
into thinking it was an extra- 
terrestrial space ship so that later 
they could embarrass him. 

I had been told of hundreds of 
excellent photographs seized by 
USAF Blue Book officers, taken 
away and never to be returned de- 
spite vigorous legal efforts to re- 
cover them — but somehow had 
never been given the name of the 
lawyer who filed the suit, the court 
in which it had been filed, or the 
judge who heard it. 

I also remembered a couple of 
USAF captains with whom I’d 
worked closely when I was in the 
space program, and their stories 
about Blue Book. Blue Book was a 
“George” job (there’s nobody to do 
it? Give it to George.) that one 
would start off conscientiously 
enough, but soon learn to despise as 
the silly and inconsistent stories 
poured in. 

However, an assignment is an as- 
signment, and I dutifully looked up 
and interviewed as many UFO ex- 
perts as I could find. 

The field turns out to be more in- 
teresting, and far more respectable, 
than I would have thought. Now 
that the research is done and paid 
for, and the subject’s fresh in my 
mind, and Jim has just called to ask 

UFO 



where’s the July column — why I 
guess I’ll just have to write about 
UFO’s. 

Interest in and study of Un- 
identified Flying Objects — UFO’s 
— is no longer confined to fanat- 
ics and eccentrics, if indeed it 
ever was. I don’t mean to imply 
contempt for all the early inves- 
tigators, or for the amateur outfits 
like MUFON who collect the bulk 
of the data on the subject. How- 
ever, professional scientists have 
now moved into the field. 

The Dean of UFO scientists is 
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Chairman of 
the Department of Astronomy at 
Northwestern, and Director of the 
Center for UFO Studies (The Cent- 
er, Box 11, Northfield, Illinois, 
60093, is a tax deductible founda- 
tion supported entirely by gifts. It 
does not accept members and is not 
a “UFO Club”, but a $10.00 dona- 
tion will get you a newsletter sub- 
scription and a lot of thanks.) 

The consultant list for the Center 
includes such notables as Dr. 
Claude Poher, one of the Directors 
of the French equivalent of NASA, 
at least one Nobel Laureate, and 
any number of random Ph.D.’s in 
various sciences. Dr. Hynek himself 
looks like a very conservative as- 
tronomer, which in fact he is. He 
was originally hired by USAF as a 
UFO consultant, and began with the 
opinion that UFO reports were non- 
sense to be explained away. Unlike 
some others, notably the late Dr. 

127 




Edmund Condon of Colorado U., 
Hynek didn’t keep that view. 

He now hopes that some progress 
on UFO research may be made dur- 
ing his lifetime, and views his 
Center as his scientific legacy. His 
book, THE UFO EXPERIENCE, is 
still the best general work on the 
subject. One sign of the increasing 
respectability of UFO studies is that 
Hynek’s book was favorably re- 
viewed by planetologist Bruce Mur- 
ray in the AAAS journal, SCI- 
ENCE. (Not that Murray is a UFO 
enthusiast; far from it; but he took 
the trouble to examine the subject 
before writing a review. Alas, such 
courtesy seems even more rare in 
the scientific professions than 
among writers.) 

Hynek’s Center is now tied in 
with many law enforcement agen- 
cies and maintains a toll-free 
number available to police; officers 
across the country can report UFO 
sightings and get advice on disposi- 
tion of UFO cases. This came about 
largely because the FBI published a 
long article on UFO’s in the Feb. 
1975 issue of the FBI Bulletin. As 
Hynek says, that’s practically “the 
Good Housekeeping Seal of Ap- 
proval.” 

All right. UFO research is re- 
spectable, if not orthodox. Now 
what the devil are UFO’s? 

No one knows. There are plenty 
of speculations, but very little evi- 
dence. We’ll go into some specula- 
tions in a moment, but first let’s see 

128 



what we’re discussing. 

First, we can say what UFO’s 
probably are not: namely, they are 
not misinterpretations of “usual” or 
“ordinary” phenomena. There are 
plenty of such, of course, but by 
definition if we can identify the 
cause, we don’t have a UFO. 

Incidentally, this is the major fail- 
ure of the Air Force-financed Con- 
don Report. Condon never investi- 
gated a single case, and chose to 
concentrate nearly all his efforts on 
known mistakes and misidentifica- 
tions. 

In fact, Condon even sought out 
people like die “man from Galaxy 
Three” who wanted $100,000 “to 
build runways on orders from 
Galaxy Control.” Condon’s ad- 
ministrator even put out a memo 
stating that the purpose of the study 
was to explain away UFO’s — but to 
make it appear that a scientific in- 
vestigation had been carried out. 

There was great concern that the 
staff would be laughed at by or- 
thodox scientists, and great efforts 
were made to show that no one in 
the study really took it seriously. 

Thus the Condon study never did 
do what the taxpayers put up their 
money for, namely, investigate un- 
identified flying objects. It does a 
pretty good job of showing the 
kinds of mistakes that have been 
made, but as a scientific study it is 
valueless. On the other hand, it 
probably served its major purpose, 
to get UFO’s out of the Air Force’s 
hair. (USAF had for years tried to 

GALAXY 




give UFO studies to someone: NSF, 
the Weather Bureau, Air Defense 
Command (Army), National 
Academy of Sciences, anyone 
who’d take it, budget and all.) 

Yet when we’ve got rid of the 
kooks and cranks, mercenaries and 
swamp gas and meteorological bal- 
loons, the planet Venus, helicop- 
ters, and hoaxes, there remain cases 
that we cannot explain. Hundreds of 
them, including nearly a hundred 
reported by multiple witnesses of 
presumed honesty and integrity. 

The USAF Assistant Chief of 
Staff, Intelligence, said back in 
1947 that “credible observers are 
reporting incredible things.” Nearly 
30 years later that’s a good sum- 
mary. The observers are credible by 
any test. The reports defy belief. 

I want to emphasize something: 
we have convicted people of murder 
on far less evidence than we have 
for the existence of “incredible” 
UFO’s. Our legal system routinely 
tries to sort out fact from fancy, and 
to examine such intangibles as 
“honesty and integrity.” However 
well it works or doesn’t work, 
courts regularly try cases on flimsier 
evidence than we have in the UFO 
reports, and hear witnesses far less 
credible than those Hynek has sin- 
gled out for his studies. 

If you were on a jury you’d be 
likely to believe the people Hynek 
has interviewed. He excludes almost 
all of the famous UFO “inves- 
tigators” who grow wealthy from 
their UFO tales. 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



Hynek’s classification scheme is 
as good as any. He sorts UFO re- 
ports into the following categories: 
Daylight Discs, Nocturnal Lights, 
Radar- Visual, and Close Encounters 
of the First, Second, and Third 
Kinds. 

The first two are simple enough. 
They also exhibit a number of 
similarities: rapid to enormous ve- 
locities and accelerations, no sonic 
boom despite high velocity, etc. 
Radar-visuals are those reported by 
both kinds of observation on the 
same phenomenon, usually by 
highly professional personnel such 
as USAF radarmen, professional air 
traffic controllers, etc. 

So far so good. Were these three 
the whole of it, we could comfort 
ourselves with the thought that 
there’s probably an explanation well 
within the limits of present-day sci- 
ence. Unfortunately they are not the 
whole of it. 

The Close Encounters are disturb- 
ing, but there’s a lot of reliable evi- 
dence for them: reliable, that is, in 
that the observers would be believed 
if they told nearly any other story. 
Close Encounters of the First Kind 
involve observations at ranges of 20 
to 500 feet, close enough to see de- 
tails. 

Close Encounters of the Second 
Kind involve some physical effect 
on the observers or their surround- 
ings: interference with auto ignition 
(a common report); movement of 
trees, as was photographed in the 
famous Oregon disc; or, sometimes, 

129 




thermal and physiological effects. 

Close Encounters of the Third 
Kind involve living creatures gener- 
ally humanoid. If we have trouble 
swallowing the first two encounters, 
this one really makes us want to 
gag; yet, again, the reports are 
about as good as those given in crimi- 
nal courts, or sent out by war cor- 
respondents, or indeed, for most of 
us, for the existence of any other 
complex phenomena we haven’t 
ourselves seen. 

Beyond this point Hynek and 
most UFO scientists draw the line. 
There are reports of actual com- 
munication with UFO’s, many giv- 
en by people who seem to be tell- 
ing the truth, but first there are few 
such, and secondly, those making 
them nearly always manifest some 
kind of psychological aberration. 
We can note that the experience it- 
self might be enough to unhinge 
most of us, and still confine our 
work to the three kinds of close en- 
counters, the discs, the night lights, 
and the radar-visuals. 

Ok. that’s the subject matter. 
Reports, sometimes accompanied by 
photographs, sometimes not. There 
aren’t a lot of photographs, and of 
those not many have been or can be 
checked and pronounced unmistaka- 
bly genuine; but there are some. 
(There are others which may be 
genuine, but can’t be proved to be; 
it’s those unmistakably genuine ones 
that are disturbing. 

Now what do we mean by 

130 



genuine? Well, among other things, 
there must be a negative, so that 
photo experts can be certain this 
isn’t either a double exposure or 
some kind of fakery from the print- 
ing lab; in other words that there’s a 
real object recorded on the film. 

Next, they want to see other ob- 
jects besides the UFO: trees, 
houses, wheat fields, etc., so that 
the distance to the UFO, and thus 
its size, can be established. This 
generally takes care of thrown ob- 
jects and the like. The experts are 
even happier with a series of photo- 
graphs, because they can take the 
sun angle off each one, and again 
eliminate a lot of thrown or sus- 
pended objects. 

I won’t go into all the tests be- 
cause I’m not a photo expert. But I 
did conduct a long interview with 
Adrian Vance of POPULAR 
PHOTOGRAPHY Magazine, and 
also with some USAF professionals, 
and I’m now convinced: there exist 
several photographs of genuine ob- 
jects, taken at distances of some 50 
to 500 feet. The objects are in 
flight. They tend to be circular, and 
of dimension about 30 feet diameter 
by 7 feet at the thickest point. At 
least one (the Oregon “saucer”) 
created enough wind to affect large 
trees. 

I find it hard to believe that’s a 
thrown or suspended object. 
Moreover, in several unrelated cases 
of photographed discs there were 
multiple observers with no obvious 
connections with each other and no 

GALAXY 




discoverable reason for making up 
the story. (As is usual in most 
cases, the observers do not want 
their names in the paper, do not 
want to be paid for their informa- 
tion, and are not interested in going 
on lecture tours.) 

Ok again, some Galaxy 
readers have always “believed” in 
UFO’s. Some others may now be 
convinced there’s something there, 
and rather a larger number are 
probably convinced that 1 believe 
there’s something there. 

So what are they? 

Gee, I don’t know. I used to say 
I was uninterested in UFO’s be- 
cause they just couldn’t be intelli- 
gent critters. Why couldn’t they? 
Because there was no place they 
could have come from. Earth? Not 
really likely. The Solar System? 
Unlikely a few years ago, virtually 
impossible now given what we’ve 
learned about the other planets. 

Another star system, then. Now 
that really raises problems. How do 
they get here? Faster than light 
travel? Science fiction aside, al- 
though the General Theory of Rel- 
ativity isn’t anywhere near univer- 
sally accepted, the Special Theory 
forbids faster than light travel by 
material objects, and gets more and 
more corroboration every year. 

But then, so what? Do I really 
“believe in” the absolute limit of 
the speed of light? No. I accept it 
as a probable working hypothesis, 
but I firmly hope to see faster than 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



light (FTL) travel in my lifetime. 1 
hope to see it; but I can’t tell you 
how it will happen, and the evi- 
dence is all against me. Still, I do 
not rule out FTL as impossible, and 
thus I can’t say interstellar visitors 
are impossible either. 

This is the point at which scien- 
tists get nervous. Not only Hynek, 
but men like Dr. Robert Wood 
(BSEE, Aeronautical Engineering; 
Ph.D., Physics, Cornell) who is an 
engineering manager for a large 
aerospace firm he’d rather not have 
named in an article on UFO’s; a 
Nobel Laureate who’d rather not be 
named at all; all say almost exactly 
the same thing when you ask, 
“What do you think UFO’s are?” 

They say: “You want some wild 
guesses? Hypotheses we’d be will- 
ing to defend at a scientific meet- 
ing? Science fiction? Where’s this 
going to be published, anyway?” 

Nervous indeed. Every one of 
them wants it clearly understood 
they’re talking hypotheses, theories 
which not only may not be true, but 
probably aren’t true; speculations, if 
you will. 

Begin with Dr. Wood. “I’d now 
be willing to defend the extra- 
terrestrial hypothesis at a AAAS or 
AIAA panel meeting.” 

Continue with Dr. Hynek: “They 
seem to act intelligently. 1 wouldn’t 
be surprised to see proof that 
they’re observers from another stel- 
lar system. I don’t say that’s what 
they are, or that 1 ‘believe’ in little 
men from outer space; but I 

131 




wouldn’t be shocked to see it 
proved.” 

Continue further with Hynek. We 
ask how they got here, given spe- 
cial relativity and all that. “People 
want answers, but we have none to 
give. Yet I suspect we may be wit- 
nessing something as far beyond us 
as, say, television would have been 
beyond Plato. After all, not too 
many years ago the best minds in 
the world couldn’t explain the 
Northern Lights. They were there. 
You could observe them. But we 
hadn’t the basic science to begin to 
understand them. I think that’s what 
we’ve got here.” 

In fact, it is precisely that which 
interests Dr. Hynek, and probably 
most other UFO scientists as well. 
Understanding UFO’s may lead us 
to new sciences far beyond anything 
we have or can now even imagine. 
It is this which leads Hynek to hope 
the UFO Center he founded will be 
his scientific legacy. 

^^HAT ARE SOME WAYS the UFO’s 
and their hypothetical inhabitants 
might achieve FTL? Hynek: 
“Perhaps they aren’t material in the 
way we think; that they use some- 
thing like television to transport 
themselves. Matter transportation, 
whether instantaneous or at very 
high velocity.” 

Robert Wood: “1 haven’t a clue. 
Yet there’s been a small revival of 
interest in either theories lately, 
have you noticed? Prehaps Special 
Relativity doesn’t hold after all. 

132 



“Also, there’s the possibility of 
gravitational interactions. Or try 
this: these things are generally re- 
ported accompanied by a really 
overwhelming magnetic field. What 
is the speed of light in a billion 
gauss magnetic field? Whatever it 
is, I’m sure there’s no magic here, 
and it may be consistent with sci- 
ence we are about to discover our- 
selves.” 

Hmm. These are scientists. 

In other words, although we 
“know” that UFO’s with intelligent 
inhabitants can’t come from our 
solar system and can’t get here from 
any other, we’ve “known” a few 
other things that turned out not to 
be so. It hasn’t been all that long 
since we “knew” the Law of Con- 
servation of Matter; that atoms 
couldn’t be split; that the Sun 
couldn’t possibly have been burning 
for longer than a few thousand, uh, 
hundred thousand, well, we can 
prove not longer than a million 
years; that heavier than air craft 
couldn’t fly, certainly couldn’t fly 
faster than the speed of sound; that 
nothing could get into outer space 
from here, well, not very far out, 
anyway; and so forth. Now some 
things we “know” turn out to be 
true, and maybe Special Relativity 
will be one of them; but maybe it 
won’t, either. 

Assume the UFO’s employ a 
technology capable of interstellar 
travel. What the devil are they do- 
ing here, and why don’t they con- 

GALAXY 




tact us and get it over with? 

Well, of course, there are a few 
who say they have made contact 
with them, but no one wants to be- 
lieve the stories. Most contact 
stories show the aliens displaying 
about the same kind of interest in us 
as we do in, say, Tobriand Island- 
ers; or Samoans. Perhaps some- 
where there is a Library where one 
can check out a text entitled Com- 
ing of Age on Terra. Discount the 
contact reports and it’s still not a 
bad hypothesis. I know of little to 
contradict the view that UFO’s are 
mostly filled with graduate students 
doing a doctoral dissertation on 
pre-spaceflight cultures. 

That explains why they don’t 
make unambiguous contacts. If they 
did, we wouldn’t be a pre- 
spaceflight culture any more; at the 
least we’d be going balls out to de- 
velop space flight. It also explains 
the sightings; they don’t want to be 
seen, but once in a while they get 
careless, as students do. 

For that matter, I can envision an 
extra-terrestrial persuading hiser (no 
sexists here; they’re hermaphroditic) 
sponsor to let hrim make “a non- 
contaminating close encounter. Af- 
ter all, Honored Academician, the 
observers won’t be believed ! And 
you’ve said my thesis isn’t original 
enough, but all the routine observa- 
tion stuff has been mined out ...” 

Or what the hell, sometimes they 
get drunk and put on a show for the 
primitives, gambling that they won’t 
be reported to their academic 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



superiors. Pasadena knows all about 
that phenomenon: in the areas 
around Cal Tech the residents shud- 
der as certain times of the year ap- 
proach. 

But blast it all, Pournelle, surely 
you don’t believe' that? 

No. But I wouldn’t die of as- 
tonishment if it turned out to be 
true, either. I don’t ‘‘believe in” 
flying saucers, in the sense that I 
spend much of my time acting as if 
Earth were being observed by in- 
terstellar graduate students in 
sophontology; I’m merely inclined 
to think it’s possible, and unable to 
think of a good alternate theory to 
account for the UFO observations. 

Yes. I know. The extra-terrestrial 
theory doesn’t account for all the 
observations. On the other hand we 
don’t have any theories that account 
for all the observations of Martian 
geography, either, but that doesn’t 
stop me from playing with about 
half a dozen mutually exclusive 
hypotheses about Mars. 

I do think this. If the ‘‘unim- 
aginative” experts of Big Science 
can take UFO’s seriously, while we 
won’t even discuss them, then sci- 
ence fiction writers’ reputations as 
speculators are in grave danger of 
disrepute. Not that we need contests 
on how many impossible things we 
can believe before breakfast; but 
can we not at least speculate consis- 
tent with the observations? Do we, 
of all people, dare ignore UFO’s 
now that study of them has become 
respectable? ★

Smoke pouring out from under

“Geis? Ha! I thought a little bon-

‘‘If you’re burning anything valu-

Here. There. Yes. Now the chains 
. .Damn, that hinge is squealing 
again. 

“Oh. .you’re only burning fan-

there. .” 



“Just trying to get your attention. 
I didn’t think you’d mind a few 
copies of Rune, Defen Droppings, 
Eternity Road, Knights Of The 
Paper Spaceship, Extrapolation, 
Seldon’s Plan, and the fanzine title 
of the year, Sfinctor, providing me 
with a bit of warmth. It gets cold 
down here. The fireplace hasn’t 
worked since you trapped Santa 
Claus in the chimney two years ago 
by closing the flue and pouring 
three gallons of stencil correction 
fluid down on him. You’re really 
evil, Geis. To my dying day I’ll 
remember his piteous cries as he 
was obliterated. And you did that 
just because he was bringing me a 
Christmas gift — a new inflatable 
rubber girl.” 

“I pride myself on my good 
character, Alter. I can’t allow you 
to indulge in obscene cavortings 
with artifacts such as that. Not any 
more. 



134 



“But—” 

“As for Santa Claus — who 
noticed he was missing? His rein- 
deer were taken by an opportunistic 
dogfood manufacturer and his sleigh 
is now in a museum in an exhibit of 
unsuccessful early automobiles. The 
lack of wheels and an engine gave 
the curators pause for a few mo- 
ments, but they concluded that that 
was why it failed.” 

“Someday, Geis, you’ll be un- 
masked, found out, revealed for the 
unfeeling cur you are. Aren’t you 
curious as to why I lured you down 
here? I lured you down here be- 
cause I want to review science fic- 
tion for you in this column.” 

*snort — snicker* “You, Alter? 
Review in Galaxy ? Why, Jim Baen 
would throw me out on my ass and 
you out on your tendrils if I let you 
vent your opinions of current sci- 
ence fiction novels. Why, already 
he must have smoking letters and 
burning phone calls from outraged 
writers howling over your incredible 
outburst in the final issue of If. You 
have no couth. You have no sense 
of proportion. You don’t play the 
game. You don’t know when to 
stop.” 

*SILENCE* 

“Why is that gap up there, 
Geis?” 

“That provides room for Jim to 
make an interjection. He likes to do 
that once in a while.” 

“Oh. Well, anything to keep the 
editor happy. From what I’ve heard 



over the years, editors have few 
happy moments.” 

“You know, Alter, this fire does 
make the Dungeon warm and cozy. 
You have my permission to throw a 
copy of Fantasy Crossroads on the 
flames. Now, get on with your 
ridiculous proposal.” 

“Why is it so ridiculous? I read 
more science fiction than you do. I 
notice things. I think deep. I have 
keen insights. Why, just last night I 
was thinking a prime keen insight 
about the way human relationships 
and Characterization are creeping 
into science fiction from the 
mainstream and slowly but surely 
polluting the precious bodily fluids 
of our favorite genre.” 

“Alter. .dear old soul, dear old 
troglodyte from nineteen-hundred- 
thirty-nine. .we have been trying 
for decades to get some decent 
characterization into science fiction. 
We have been crying to the heavens 
for realistic human relationships in 
science fiction. You are trying to 
tell me now this is a bad thing, just 
when it is finally beginning to hap- 
pen? You are out of your tree, your 
gourd has split and you are certifi- 
able. I’ll have to call the Home 
and—” 

“Hear me, Geis. I am issuing a 
Dire Warning. It is true that good 
characterization and true-to-life 
people problems are improving sci- 
ence fiction, but — 

“I knew there had to be a but.” 
“But beware the siren call of 
Characterization — note the capital 



135 




C — and people problems. What I 
read lately is disturbing to my Early 
Warning glands. I sense the camel 
sliding his nose into the tent. I see a 
trend toward too much of a good 
thing. I see stories appearing in 
which the accent, the focus, is on 
character development and interper- 
sonal trauma, while the science- 
fictional element is. .is. .” 
“Short-sheeted?” 

“Exactly! 

“Buildups! As a Cassandra, Al- 
ter, you are a flop. You’re reach- 
ing. Why, the next thing I know 
you’ll be telling me gold will be 
worth $250 an ounce by the time 
this gets published. Ho, ho. I am 
going back to bed.” 

“Beware, Geis. Mark my words. 
Science fiction is a literature of 
ideas, as I read recently that Ray 
Bradbury once said. And science 
fiction is not a literature of human 
problems and personalities. It is a 
question of which is to be 
served — which is to be master — the 
ideas or the people.” 

“There is no question in my 
mind, Alter. / am master here, and 
I order you to shut up. .and put 
out that fire. It’s creeping too close 
to my precious collection of Tim 
Kirk fanzine covers.” 

“I defy thee, Geis. I will say my 
say. If you shut me up — I’ll find 
another master. Maybe Andy Porter 
could use a good, healthy Alter- 
Ego. Certainly Algol could use 
some personality. Maybe I could 
tunnel my way out, and — ” 

136 



“Okay, okay l I’ll give you a few 
more minutes.” 

“I thought you would. If you 
lose me, Geis, no one will read a 
thing you write.” 

‘ ‘ Get on with it!’ ' 

“As I was saying, it’s a matter, 
in fiction, of which fictional ele- 
ment is paramount, and which sub- 
servient. Lately, in science fiction, I 
see subtle signs that some writers 
are starting to use the science or 
sense-of-wonder element (the stuff 
that makes science fiction different) 
as decoration for their true 
purposes — psyche-exploration and 
spiritual miasma. Also, the agonies 
of living with other people. This is 
merely transplanting the mainstream 
into sf, Geis. Endless examinations 
of navels killed “serious” 
mainstream writing, and now that 
swamp has a foot in the door of 
science fiction. We’ve got to stop 
it, Geis!” 

“Umm? How can a swamp get a 
foot in the door?” 

“You know what I mean! Let 
fine, realistic characterizations and 
relationships be used to enhance, to 
support, to make more real and 
breathtaking the sense-of-wonder 
elements of science fiction. The sci- 
ence idea, the strange view, the 
mind-bending concepts that are the 
core of science fiction must always 
be top dog. Because human rela- 
tionships are inherently limited, and 
so are introspections-in-depth, and 
“characterizations” in depth. Let 
them decorate the idea."

“Is that a promise? It better be a

“Oh, boy! (Slurp.)”

NOBODY HERE 
BUT US 





SAM LUNDWALL 



In the end there was 
nothing he could give her. 



1 was walking down the steps of 
the Probal Office Building when the 
girl intercepted me. 

I was in my early twenties then 
and had been Upside for more than 
two months, subjective time, sealed 
into a steel chamber with a couple 
of technicians whom I had come to 
dislike with an intensity I had 
not realized was possible before we 
finally managed to return. 

But the worst of it had been the 
lack of feminine companionship; 
this one was cute — not beautiful, 
but anybody without a beard would 



have done right then. I slowed 
down and stared at her. Long, flow- 
ing hair; at least ten years older 
than me, to judge by the lines 
around eyes and mouth; an old- 
fashioned dress at least two sizes 
too small. If she was trying to draw 
my attention she succeeded.- Not 
that she needed any devices; like 1 
said, my attention was very draw- 
able just then. 

“. isn’t that a Probal badge?” 
she asked, her voice tense with a 
nervousness 1 did not notice at the 
time. I glanced down at my lapel 
with the small blue-and-green 
badge. Very discreet. Nobody ever 
notices it; nobody, except this wo- 
man who was staring at it so hun- 
grily. 

“Sure,” \ said. “So?” 

“You . work in there.” She 
indicated the pockmarked facade. 

“You can call it that. Mostly I 
just wait for something to happen.” 
I grinned at her, trying for a daz- 
zling, captivating smile and failing 
miserably. 

It didn’t matter; her eyes never 
left my badge. “Have you 



139 




been . .Upside?” 

“I’m just back down,” I replied. 
“Half an hour ago, I was sitting in 
a steel box without the foggiest no- 
tion of when I’d be let out.” I shiv- 
ered. “Look, let’s get away from 
here. I’ve been Upside for two 
months and I want to get as far 
from Probal as possible. That place 
gives me the jitters.” I started to 
walk down the steps and into the 
plaza, as diffuse images of that 
plaza formed in my mind. I looked 
away. She fell into step with me. 

“Is it that bad?” she asked soft- 
ly- 

“Some of it.” I looked down and 
noticed that she was still talking to 
my badge. Obviously it was not me 
that interested her, just the badge. I 
said, “Excuse me, but I have had a 
rotten time and I’m on my way 
somewhere. What is this about?” 
She walked beside me for several 
minutes without saying anything. 
Finally; “I’m interested.” 

“Well, I’m not. I’ve had enough 
of that place for a long time.” I 
was deliberately rude; I was in des- 
perate need of a drink and female 
company, partially to assuage the 
needs of the flesh, but primarily as 
a means of getting away from the 
Probal business and the things that 
were trying to crawl up from my 
subconsciousness. This just wasn’t 
worth it. 

“A personal interest,” she said, 
looking straight ahead. 

That figured. I looked down at 
her, the nervous mouth, the darting 

140 



eyes. I said, “How long have you 
been waiting here?” 

“A long time.” 

“And it just happened to be 
me?” 

She nodded. 

“Most people at Probal,” I said, 
“never leave the building. “When 
they have been at it long enough, 
they don’t seem to like it outside 
any more. They just stay indoors 
like the world doesn’t exist.” I 
nodded at the dark building. “Not 
even a window. Hardly anyone ever 
leaves the place. ’ ’ 

“I know,” she said. 

“So?” 

“Sometimes,” she said, “Probal 
people take things from Upside. I’m 
interested in that.” 

“Nobody takes anything from 
Upside,” I said, momentarily taken 
aback. Nobody ever took anything 
from Upside, not because it wasn’t 
possible — it was — but because 
everyone knew what would happen 
if they did. It just wasn’t done. 

She shrugged. “How long have 
you been with Probal?” 

“Three years.” 

“Perhaps it was before your 
time, then.” 

“Never,” I insisted. 

She switched the subject. 
“Where were you going?” 

“A drink somewhere.” I shrugged. 
“And something else.” 

“Let me buy you one.” She 
smiled suddenly. “To make up for 
all this. We could talk about some- 
thing else.” 



GALAXY 




We went somewhere and had a 
few drinks and the kind of dinner I 
had been dreaming of for two solid 
months. She was very nice, smiling 
at the right places, laughing at the 
right places. Two months’ isolation 
had made her pretty. Three drinks 
later she was ravishing. I started 
giving her hints about my exalted 
position at Probal. She ate it up, 
just as I had expected. 

Which was curious, to say the 
very least, since nobody is in- 
terested in Probal and the work it 
does. Indeed, I had been perfectly 
indifferent myself before I got the 
job there. I knew it was some kind 
of government agency doing re- 
search in Probability Lines — 
whatever they were — and that the 
big, ugly building contained a large 
number of scientists and assorted 
personnel, most of them actually 
living there. 

There was nothing secret about 
it — who would be interested in 
“Probability Lines” anyway? — and 
to me it was just another ugly build- 
ing until I graduated and went job- 
less until I had got down to “P” in 
the yellow pages and called them 
up. That was a long, long time ago. 

I’m not a scientist, I don’t know 
much about the theories behind the 
Probability Line Search and most of 
what 1 know I don’t understand. I 
just press my buttons and sit tight in 
my steel chamber while everybody’s 
beards get longer and shaggier and 
the pressure builds. Most of the 
time it isn’t too bad, of course; a 



quick trip Upside and then back 
with the computer loaded with read- 
ings. Once in a while you might 
draw a two month graveyard shift, 
but apart from that it’s ok. 

One gets used to it with time, I 
suppose. Or rather, one learns to 
live with it. It’s just that after a few 
years you don’t want to face the 
outside world anymore, hence the 
windowless apartments in Probal 
Building. There are TV monitors in 
the steel chambers. You see things. 

We were sitting in a back booth 
at the restaurant, well away from 
the windows, and I said, “Look, I 
don’t know much about it and that’s 
the truth. Not my line of job, that’s 
for the scientists. All I know isj we 
step into a steel chamber and go off 
along a probability line somewhere, 
and I don’t do the settings. I just go 
along.” 

“But why do you call it Up- 
side?” she asked. 

I shrugged. “I don’t know. 
That’s what it’s called. We go 
along a probability line to a version 
of this world that didn’t happen, but 
could have happened if something 
had been different, and then we sit 
there and check the place.” 

“Check what?” 

“Damned if I know. Humidity, 
traces of radioactivity, visual 
search ...” I shivered despite the 
heat. “Some of the probability 
worlds are nasty. Others . are 
not so bad.” 

“Better than here.” It was a 
statement, not a question. 



NOBODY HERE BUT US SHADOWS 



141 




“Much better, some of them.” I 
drank, lost in thought. 

“What if you should go out 
through the door?” she said. 

“Locked,” I said. “From the out- 
side. Impossible.” 

“But if you could unlock it?” 
“Then out I’d go.” 

“So it is possible, then?” 

“Sure, it is possible, no trouble 
at all, if . .” I checked myself. “I 
don’t know about that. No one ever 
went out, so why ask?” 

“So you just sit there?” 

“Yep. Sometimes for a couple of 
hours, sometimes for a couple of 
months. It all depends on condi- 
tions, I don’t know why, but some- 
times you can get back whenever 
you want, and sometimes you 
can’t.” 

“Sounds primitive,” she said. 

“It is primitive. Probability lines 
were discovered less than ten years 
ago, they are still searching in the 
dark. Anyway, that’s not my stuff. 
I just press buttons and watch. I 
rose. “Let’s go somewhere.” 

We went to another place and 
had another couple of drinks. By 
the time we finished them she was 
more than ravishing. I wanted her 
so much it hurt. Two months of 
frustrated youthful masculinity 
screamed to be let out. I was ready 
to go a long way to get closer. We 
sat in an all-night cafe and she said, 
“How come they have never 
brought anything from Upside?” 

I shrugged, my mind caressing 
her thighs. 

142 



“Perhaps they did, once,” she 
said quietly. “When the project 
started.” 

“Perhaps,” I said indifferently. 
“They know what happens if you 
do, so I guess ...” Then I caught 
myself. “Look; nobody is supposed 
to know about that.” 

“About what?” 

“Nothing.” I should have walked 
out on her — but I was shy and be- 
sides, I felt I had a right to her by 
now; for having listened to her for 
so long. 

“They did experiments when 
they started Probability Line 
Search,” she said. “They did ex- 
periments. They brought things 
from Upside.” 

“Sure they did — then they 
realized what they were doing and 
dropped the whole thing. What do I 
know? I only work there!” I was 
beginning to get mad. “Isn’t there 
anything else to talk about? I’m off 
duty, for God’s sake!” 

She looked down in her glass. 
“I’m sorry.” 

“Never mind.” I felt ashamed. 
“I’m sorry I blew my top like that. 
But I’ve been cooped up in that 
steel chamber for two months now, 
looking at the same damned scene 
in the monitors all the time and 
never knowing when conditions 
would let us return home. Right 
now I just want to forget about it.” 

She looked straight ahead, her 
eyes obscured by the shadows. 
“Imagine what it would be like if 
you had been thrown into that scene 

GALAXY 




with no way back.” She bit her lip. 
“I’m sorry,” she said again. 

“Let’s forget about it.” I slipped 
an arm around her waist. She stif- 
fened momentarily, then relaxed, 
and even smiled. “Let’s go.” 

“Where?” 

“I have a place. We can talk 
there.” 

She said, “In the Probal Build- 
ing?” 

“I’m not that far gone yet,” I 
said. “I have a place of my own a 
few blocks away from Probal. Nice 
and quiet.” 

She hesitated. Then, “Okay.” 
She rose and quickly Walked out. I 
followed her into the night, slipped 
an arm around her, drew her close 
to me. She walked stiffly, staring 
straight ahead. 

“I don’t know what you think of 
me,” she said. “Coming on to you 
like this and then just talking about 
your job all the time. You must be 
tired of me by now.” 

“Not that tired,” I said. My fin- 
gers dug into her waist. Her body 
was warm and full of promises, 
swaying against me with every step. 
I could hardly breathe. 

We came to my place. A small, 
cramped room with a bed and not 
very much else, heavy curtains be- 
fore the window. She took in the 
room with a quick glance. “It’s 
small,” she said. 

“I’m not here often,” I said. “I 
don’t need much.” 

She walked up to the window. 
“Don’t!” I said sharply. 



She turned. “Don’t you like the 
view?” 

I sat heavily down on the bed. 
“Just keep the curtains as they 
are,” I said. I hesitated. “Look, I 
have been sitting for two months, 
looking at TV monitors showing the 
plaza outside the Probal Building. It 
looked exactly like the plaza, it was 
the plaza, but a plaza on another 
probability line. There were . 
executions there, night and day, 
things you couldn’t imagine. 

I was scared as hell when I came 
out today; I knew that that was a 
different probability line, but I was 
screaming inside all the time we 
were crossing the plaza. This whole 
city scares me. A year or two from 
now I won’t be able to go out at 
all, so please leave the curtains. I 
don’t want to see what’s out there.” 

She came over and sat down be- 
side me, not saying anything. 

“You don’t understand,” I rant- 
ed. “No one understands who hasn’t 
experienced it. Look, on most lines 
the city looks exactly the same as 
the one we are in now, with only 
subtle differencies. People dress dif- 
ferently, the cars look different, 
things like that. But sometimes 
people act differently; they do 
things you wouldn’t think people 
could do. And sometimes there’s no 
city at all, just meadows or woods. 
Once there was nothing but 
water — and on one line there was 
nothing at all, literally nothing; just 
a sort of whirling mist that tears at 
you even via the monitors. 



NOBODY HERE BUT US SHADOWS 



143 




“Don’t you see?” I said desper- 
ately, “how can I know what is real 
and what is not? Every one of those 
probability lines are as real as the 
one we are in right now. After a 
time you don’t know which line is 
the most real, which one you really 
belong to, which one you will re- 
turn to when you leave the 
chamber. When you step out, it’s 
just like stepping out into another 
line, and if you have come from 
one of the beautiful lines you can’t 
stand it here, you just count the 
days until you can go Upside again, 
and all the time the ground heaves 
under your feet because you don’t 
know what’s reality anymore; you’ll 
never know. You only know that 
everything scares you and you can’t 
stand it.” I leaned back in the bed, 
closing my eyes. 

She put a cool hand on my brow 
and leaned against my shoulder, 
soft and yielding, smelling of bot- 
tled roses. I embraced her like a 
drowning man, dragging her down 
on the bed. She protested feebly but 
at that point I was past arguing. She 
resisted at first, then subsided and 
went through the motions. 

After a time I rolled over beside 
her, groping in the dark for cigaret- 
tes. I felt warm, satisfied and 
somewhat drowsy. And now that 
that throbbing yearning had lost 
some of its edge, I also felt a bit 
ashamed. 

She went into the bathroom for a 
while, then came out and started the 
coffee percolator. She moved silent- 

144 



ly, a dark shadow in the dusky 
room. 

“You mad?” I asked. 

She returned with the coffee, sit- 
ting down in the bed with the tray 
between us. She said, “No. Ten 
years ago, I would have been ter- 
rified, I would have screamed, 
cried. Now it doesn’t matter much 
one way or the other.” She peered 
at me, eyes gleaming dully in the 
darkness of her face. “You could 
have done it more slowly.” 

“Empathy with other people,” I 
said, “is among the first things that 
go on this job; when you get to the 
point when you can’t discern be- 
tween what is reality and what is 
not, you don’t care much for other 
people’s feelings.” 

“I know,” she said. 

“You don’t,” I said. I sipped at 
the coffee. It was bitter, strong, 
with more than a hint of — what? I 
made a grimace at the vile taste. 
“Jesus, what’s this?” 

She looked at the cup. “I’m sor- 
ry,” she said. You don’t take it that 
way. She went away to the per- 
colator and returned with a new 
cup, sweet and steaming. “After all 
these years,” she said, “I still 
forget. Here.” She handed me the 
cup. 

I asked, sipping at the coffee, 
“Where do you come from?” 

“You wouldn’t know the place,” 
she replied. 

“Try me.” 

“Somewhere around here, not 
more than a kilometer away.” 

GALAXY 




“You don’t sound like you were 
born here,’’ I said. “That funny ac- 
cent, for instance, you sound like 
someone who has arrived fairly re- 
cently.” 

“When I was born,” she said 
quietly, “there was no city here.” 

I grinned at her. “Sure,” I said. 
“And this city is centuries old. You 
look younger.” 

“I was here ten years ago,” she 
said, “and there was no city here 
then.” 

I suddenly felt chilly. “What do 
you mean?” I said. 

“There was a small village 
here,” she said. “And a few 
kilometers away was a kind of 
feudal stronghold. No cars or rock- 
ets, just a few dirigibles now and 
then. Very peaceful, very rural, 
very isolated.” 

I was conscious of a cold, grow- 
ing spot in my stomach. “It sounds 
like something out of a fairy tale,” 
I said. 

“You wouldn’t understand,” she 
said tiredly, as if she had been tel- 
ling and retelling this tale until the 
words were spoken of their own 
free will. “I was taken from 
there.” 

“You’re joking. I don’t — 
how?” 

“You know. The chamber.” 

I sat up so violently I almost 
spilled the coffee into my lap. 
“You’re crazy,” I told her. “No- 
thing and nobody can be taken 
away from one probability line to 
another. It can’t be done!” 



“That’s what everybody tells 
me,” she said quietly. “I have been 
waiting here for ten years, and 
everybody tells me it is impossible. 
They told me that in the Probal 
Building when I was brought here, 
and when I talk to the men who 
come out from there they all tell me 
the same thing.” She looked away. 
“I have been asking everyone for 
ten years,” she said. “I have been 
waiting outside that building for ten 
years, and everyone tells me the 
same thing.” 

“What do you want?” 

“Togo back.” 

She stayed two days. She was 
cool and remote but very obliging. 
She did not talk much about that 
fantasy of hers after the first night, 
but I wondered. The second day I 
want to the Probal librarian and 
asked him. He seemed uncomforta- 
ble and said he didn’t know. I 
checked on my own, and found that 
the relevant data dossiers were re- 
stricted, off limits for the likes of 
me. When I returned, she smiled 
tiredly and wrote down a code 
number for me. 

“I got this once,’’ she said, 
“from a computer technician who 
had access to all the classified mate- 
rial. He said I wouldn’t have much 
use for it anyway. But this is where 
I came from.” 

“I can’t help you,” I said. 

“I know,” she said. “I didn’t 
really believe you could. I never 

145 



NOBODY HERE BUT US SHADOWS 




hope much these days; I just wait 
and wait and go through the mo- 
tions, but I don’t really hope any- 
more.” 

“I’m just a technician,” I said. 
“I press the buttons and go Upside 
and handle the machinery and look 
at the monitors; that’s all I do. I’m 
just a small cog in the machinery, 
that’s all.” 

“I know,” she said. “I’m sorry 
I’ve bothered you.” 

Next day she was gone. A few 
weeks later I spoke to a guy at the 
Probal office about her. 

“Sure,” he said, “I’ve seen 
her. Everyone here has seen her at 
least once. Always waits outside. 
She’s crazy, thinks she comes from 
one of the probability lines and 
wants to go back. There’s lots of 
crazy people in the world. Forget 
her.” 

“She said it happened ten years 
ago,” I said. “That could have 
been when the project started and 
no one knew what would happen if 
something were taken from its 
probability line. They know now, 
so they must have found out one 
way or another.” 

He shrugged. “What do I know? 
Anyway, even if it’s true, she can’t 
go back now.” 

Never. There is some kind of 
mathematics to explain that, but I’m 
not a mathematician. All I know is 
that the door in the chamber is 
locked from the outside while it is 
Upside. Under no circumstances 
whatever must anything be taken 

146 



from or added to . 

Someone must have found out the 
hard way. 

I would see her now and then, 
standing on the steps of Probal 
Building, waiting without any real 
hope while her shoulders sank and 
her face hardened into frozen lines. 
The first years, some of the younger 
technicians picked her up when on 
leave and took her to bed. She did 
anything for the ones who were will- 
ing to talk to her. But then she 
wasn’t so pretty anymore and they 
hurried past her, looking the other 
way. 

By then I seldom went out any- 
more; the city scared me, every- 
thing outside the building scared 
me. I thought of probability lines 
more beautiful and more horrible 
than any man’s imagination, I saw 
the ever-changing worlds in the 
monitors, all of them as real or as 
unreal as my own, and it frightened 
me. 

I finally moved into a windowless 
flat in the building. I never went 
out again. 

Many years later I came across 
the piece of paper with the code 
number of her probability line and 
during a test run I fed the number 
into the line selector and went Up- 
side. 

I leaned down over the monitor 
and looked into the whirling empti- 
ness of the world that had been hers 
before she was taken from it and I 
saw nothing. 

Nothing. ★

ILffective with this issue, I am 
the new official reviewer for 
Galaxy. Please note the word: “re- 
viewer,” not “critic.” A critic tells 
you what you ought to like — I hope 
to tell you what I think you will 
like, and what you won’t. All 
across the world there are folks stand- 
ing in front of a grossly overstuffed, 
science-fiction section in their local 
bookstore, with a buck ninety-five 
burning a hole in their pocket and 
Sturgeon’s Law (“ninety percent of 
everything is crap”) burning in their 
hearts. I T d like to try and help you 
put your buck ninety-five or what- 
ever, in a good investment. 

Now this, of course, puts me in 
one hell of a position. I write this 
stuff for a living, see, and I hang 
out with other guys that do — the 
same guys whose books I’m either 
going to be praising or knocking, 
and writers are not noted for small 
egos. As of now I happen not to 
have really hated any books by 



people I know, but it’s sure and hell 
bound to happen soon. So if any 
writers are listening, please be as- 
sured that I can love you and hate 
your latest book (got that, Harlan?). 
And for the rest of you, I promise 
to do my damndest to give you my 
honest opinion as to the relative 
worth of the books I review. 

Which is not to say that I’m go- 
ing chasing after the mythical “ob- 
jectivity.” I’ve got my own set of 
prejudices as to what is and isn’t 
good science fiction, and I have no 
intention of trying to list them — 
you’ll just have to pay attention and 
deduce them yourselves. The best I 
can do is try to be consistent about 
’em, and to try and consciously re- 
member and reflect what I conceive 
to be the prejudices of you — the 
hypothetical and probably mythical 
Average Reader. If you think I’m 
blowing it, write Baen a nasty let- 
ter. Enough of this; on with the 
show.

First, the one that got all the noise: 
Richard Adams’s remarkable Water- 
ship Down is nowhere near worthy 
of the three or four pages of incred- 
ible critical reviews with which 
Avon prefaces the paperback 
version — it is not, as everyone from 
Bucky Fuller to the Times (both 
Timeses ) claims, the greatest work 
of art to emerge from modern man. 
It’s only one of the best books I’ve 
read in a helluva long time. 

Rare indeed is the writer who 
satisfies as both a wordsmith and a 
storyteller, but Adams pulls it off. 
The book reads like a cross between 
Tolkien, Euell Gibbons and Ken- 
neth Grahame ( Wind in the Willows, 
twit), and avoids the weaknesses of 
all three. It concerns a race of 
non-humans in a near-Utopia, one 
of whom is a clairvoyant. Having 
had a vision of some inexplicable 
doom lurking on the horizon, he 



persuades a handful of friends to 
leave their home and undertake a 
quest for a new and safer one. 
Along the way the group meets 
trial, battle and sudden death. 
Sounds pretty standard, huh? Here’s 
the kicker: the non-humans are ter- 
restrial lapines — rabbits. The 

prophesied doom is the bulldozing 
of their warren for a housing de- 
velopment, and the quest covers 
maybe ten miles. 

Please don’t make the same mis- 
take I did — ignore all the rave re- 
views, forgot that the damned thing 
was a number one bestseller for 
nearly a year. If you go into it ex- 
pecting the New Tolkien you will, 
as I did, spend the first two hundred 
pages being disgruntled. What it is, 
is good solid writing of the evoca- 
tive school, that is, the “paint ’em 
a picture” kind in which you for- 
give the fact that every, little brush 
stroke shows, because they’re such 
fine brush-strokes. Generally I pre- 
fer the sort of background descrip- 
tion that allows me to use my own 
imagination, but in this case I have 
to admit that Adams’ is richer and 
better informed. He obviously 
knows rabbits as well as he knows 
the area in which these rabbits live, 
and he anthropomorphizes them 
only as much as he has to in order 
to give us a comprehensible story. 
A story, I might add, with all the 
adventure, excitement and internal 
consistency you could ask for, with 
a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. 

Second, the one that should have 
gotten all the noise, and didn’t: 



148 




I’m so excited by The Princess 
Bride that I usually become incoher- 
ent when I attempt to talk about it. 
Much as I like Watership, I’d in- 
fintely prefer to give this alternately 
thrilling and hilarious adventure- 
fantasy my vote for the Hugo and/or 
the Tolkien Memorial Award. Ex- 
cept I can’t — Goldman’s book, like 
Adams’s, is ineligible, having ap- 
peared in hardcover a couple of 
years back and sunk without a rip- 
ple. Why the hell is beyond me, un- 
less it’s antimainstream phobia. 

Goldman is, of course, the man 
who gave us Butch Cassidy and the 
Sundance Kid, not to mention Boys 
and Girls Together and a host of 
other superb mainstream novels, 
plays and movies, as well as an as- 
tonishingly good analysis of Broad- 
way, The Season. Make no mistake, 
this man can write until your nose 
bleeds and your ears drip wax: he is 
A Pro. And Bride is, to my mind, 
not only the best thing he ever 
wrote, but the best sword & sorcery 
adventure that ever came down the 
pike — I haven’t been so excited 
about a book since I finished Stand 
On Zanzibar (which it in no way 
resembles). The subtitle that is 
omitted in the paperback version 
promises “fencing, fighting, tor- 
ture, poison, true love, hate, re- 
venge, giants, hunters, bad men, 
good men, beautifullest ladies, 
snakes, spiders, beasts of all natures, 
pain, death, brave men, coward 
men, strongest men, chases, es- 
capes, lies, truths, passion and 
miracles.” 

GALAXY 



Friends, that ain't the half of it. 

The book is set, like a diamond 
in a gold brooch, within a delightful 
hoax: Goldman alleges that Bride 
was in fact written by “the famous 
Florinese writer Simon Morgan- 
stern,” and that Goldman himself is 
only the abridger, who threw out 
Morganstern’s political and social 
satire to give you “the good parts 
version.” He claims that his 
Florinese father read the good parts 
to him while he was recovering 
from pneumonia at the age of ten, 
converting him in one stroke from a 
sports-type to a “novel-holic.” God 
knows why Goldman uses this 
device — but by Jesus it could have 
happened that way. If you know a 
kid who hates to read, buy him or 
her The Princess Bride and stand 
clear. 

If the book ever gets the recogni- 
tion it deserves, it will doubtless be 
labeled “a fairy tale for adults,” 
but that is wrong. It is the type of 
fairy tale we ought to be reading to 
our kids — and aren’t — because it in- 
sists on one overriding message: 
that Life may be full of adventure 
and wonder and excitement and 
glory, but what it ain’t is Fair. 

Oh yeah, I nearly forgot — the 
book is funny as hell too. 

Okay, enough of this 
mainstream gobbidge — back to good 
ol’ Hardcore (how come the 
mainstream produces Bride and 
Watership, and the best True Blue- 
dom has to offer these days is Nine 

149 




Princes In Vmboredl). John Brun- 
ner’s The Stone That Never Came 
Down is one dandy piece of work. 
It manages to neatly avoid every 
one of the potholes that his 
Shockwave Rider sprained its ankles 
in, and emerges as one of John’s 
best. As didactic as Rider in its 
way, it never out-and-out lectures 
without a good dramatic foundation, 
and its characters live and breathe. 

The setting is England in the near 
future; the pendulum of morality 
has swung back with a vengeance, 
and the Godheads, hoodlum reli- 
gious fanatics, go about the city ex- 
torting alms, trashing bars and 
brothels, and beating the stew out 
of the ungodly with wooden cross- 
es. They get away with it because 
government is under the influence 
of the Campaign Against Moral Pol- 
lution (love those acronyms of 
yours, John), a powerful lobby in- 
deed. Power, food and other systems 
are collapsing under gross misman- 
agement; there’s civil insurrection in 
Glasgow; and on the horizon the 
seeds of World War III are inexora- 
bly sprouting in, of all places, Italy. 

The only hope is a mysterious 
new drug called VC, which 
confers — no, imposes — eidetic 

memory, forcing one to remember 
and integrate all the data he’s ever 
acquired. It prohibits what Brunner 
calls “selective inattention,’’ the 
tendency of humans to forget or ig- 
nore what they’d rather — on which 
Brunner blames much of the 
world’s ills. Motivated by, and 

BOOKSHELF 



armed with, this new discovery, a 
handful of men and women attempt 
to head off the war they now cannot 
help but see coming, by dosing key 
people with VC in a race against 
time. 

Now, the corollary to the moral 
imperative that grew out of the 
Psychedelic Age (“Thou shalt not 
prevent thy brother from altering his 
consciousness.”) is that thou shalt 
not alter thy brother’s consciousness 
without his consent, and I for one 
can imagine no greater crime (in- 
cluding murder), good intentions be 
go to hell. And yet, dammit, Brun- 
ner presents an excellent case for 
doing just that thing. I’m not certain 
he’s convinced me, but I’m sure go- 
ing to be thinking about it for some 
time. 

Altogether a fine story, that alter- 
nately curdles the blood and warms 
the heart that pumps it. 

D here, on the other hand, we 
have Gordy Dickson with another 
drug, and the message that in- 
creased intelligence is not The 
Answer. 

Gordy by now has polished to 
perfection the technique of stating a 
fascinating premise, giving you about 
half a chapter to absorb it, and 
then punching you in the head re- 
peatedly until the breath is com- 
pletely knocked out of you. You 
guessed it — he’s done it again. 

And he shouldn’4 have been able 
to. The plot of The R-Master — the 
world has seemingly achieved 

150 





Utopia but is in fact in dangerous 
stagnation — is almost as old as 
boy-meets-girl. But then the “as an 
outsider what do you think of the 
human race?” gag had long white 
hair when Heinlein used it for 
Stranger In A Strange' Land, and 
look how that turned out. To the 
base plot Gordy adds the premise 
that there is a drug called R-47 
which has four possible effects: it 
may raise or lower your I.Q. a few 
trifling points, it may do nothing, or 
it may make you either a 
supergenius or a hopeless moron. 
With that he’s off and running, with 
surprise after surprise. 

R-Master is not one of Gordy ’s 
major works; some of the charac- 
terization is sketchy, some questions 
are unanswered, and I found the 
ending just a bit unsatisfying — but it 
is good solid action-packed stuff, 
and it made me think. Particularly 
when read concurrently with Brun- 
ner’s book. 

If you didn’t know that A. Ber- 
tram Chandler is an Australian 
nationalist and a Horatio 
Hornblower-freak, The Big Black 
Mark will make it abundantly clear. 
It fills in the missing link in the 
career of John Grimes (who, like 
Lord Nelson, is loosely based on 
the life of Hornblower), the man 
who’s been paying for Chandler’s 
groceries for many years now. 
Grime’s rise from ensign in the 
Galactic Federation fleet to admiral 
of the Rim Worlds fleet has been 

GALAXY 



amply chronicled in hundreds of 
thousands of words of often excel- 
lent SF — but until now we never 
knew exactly what caused him to 
change his loyalties from Federation 
to Rim. 

Truth to tell, I’m just a little dis- 
appointed to learn — but I can’t ex- 
plain why without giving away too 
many surprises. Suffice it to hint 
that Black Mark borrows just a bit 
too heavily from both Nordhoff & 
Hall and Herman Wouk, if you get 
my galactic drift. True-blue Grimes 
fans should be satisfied, but I found 
it pat in spots, contrived in others, 
and a little too reminiscent of some 
of the worst Star Trek episodes (the 
“Earth culture transplanted bodily 
to the stars” type), though emi- 
nently readable. 

But then I liked the drunken Irish 
telepath — I’m a bit of a nationalist 
at heart too. 

Jack vance’s The Gray Prince 
bothers the hell out of me. It has an 
excellent theme, with a tomato- 
surprise ending that defies guessing, 
and involves some moral questions 
that are more and more relevant 
these days. But you have to wade 
through some god-awful stuff to get 
there. 

The writing style is of a pedantic, 
top-heavy sort which the dust-jacket 
calls “evocative” and I call 
Byzantine — it kept me thumbing my 
dictionary and increased my vo- 
cabulary immensely, but it didn’t 
arouse my interest: even the fight 

151 




scenes were stately. I pressed on, 
and discovered that there seem to 
be four or five protagonists, with 
whom Vance plays Musical View- 
points at random and without 
warning — and none of them is The 
Gray Prince, who turns out to be a 
very minor character and a humbug 
in the bargain. Finally, I was hor- 
ribly annoyed by Vance’s heavy 
use of footnotes to explain plot es- 
sentials rather than working them 
into the story* — and worse, by the 
fact that non-essential footnotes of- 
ten held more potential interest than 
the text, and were invariably aban- 
doned. When the interruptions are 
more interesting than the matter at 
hand, something is badly wrong. 

All in all, Prince reads like a his- 
tory professor’s dry and academic 
account of what one can dimly see 
must have been a rousing era. But 
if you read only the prologue and 
the last two chapters, you’ll find 
some thoughtful and stimulating 
moral philosophy. It’s the middle 
hundred and sixty-four pages that 
hung me up. 

It’s hard to write meaningfully 
about a non-theme short-story col- 
lection at any great length. Fred 
Saberhagen is a fine writer, largely 
and correctly famous for his Ber- 
serker cycle, concerning the war be- 
tween mankind and an unliving 
robot culture programmed by its 
centuries-dead Masters with a 

*actually / just hate footnotes on princi- 
ple. 

152 



single overriding kamikaze direc- 
tive: to destroy all sentient organic 
life in the universe. But only two of 
the ten tales in The Book of 
Saberhagen are about the Berserkers 
(two of the best in the series, inci- 
dentally). 

The non-Berserker stories vary 
from fair to excellent, touching all 
bases in between. “Deep Space” is 
an old favorite of mine — but don’t 
read Fred’s introduction to it until 
after you’ve read the story, or 
you’ll spoil the ending (by which 
I’ve probably ensured that you’ll do 
just that, but what can you do?). 
“Starsong” is particularly out- 
standing, a very short story that 
somehow manages to leave you 
with the impression that you’ve just 
read a novelette — a trick I wish I 
could pull off considering that they 
pay us by the word in this racket. 
Book of is recommended for all 
Saberhagen fans, and especially for 
those who don’t know him yet. 

If they can give Hugos for 
“dramatic” SF, why can’t I review 
it? Somebody should have warned 
me about Westworld, py yiminy, 
and only masochists and social- 
hypochondriacs read newspapers 
these days. 

Okay, then — here goes. By now 
everybody’s probably gotten the 
word that the Star Trek cartoon 
series is almost as good as the orig- 
inal, and in some ways better — 
spectacular visuals are cheaper to 
produce, Kirk looks less wooden,

and so on — but if I know fen \pl. of 
fan — Ed.], it’ll take more than one 
goodie (and a recycled one at that) 
to j»et you out of bed on a Sunday 
morning. Land of the Lost, with 
scripts by the likes of Ben Nova, 
Larry Niven, Robert Silverberg and 
David Gerrold, ought to have filled 
the bill, but mediocre directing, 
kindergarten special effects and 
ghastly acting can strangle even the 
best writing. One Pro tells me he 
keeps the pseudonym “Michael

sions. 

But there turns out to be after all . 
a superb Sunday morning show, 
like Land of The Lost non-cartoon, 
which has been destroying my 
lifelong habit of sloth for weeks 
now, with no relief in sight. Korg 
70,000 B.C. is its unlikely title, and 
Fred Freiberger is the Story Editor. 

The show concerns itself with the 
problems of moral and social de- 
velopment facing a small band of 
Neanderthals led by a gent named 
Korg. The scripts are good enough 
to remind me of Heinlein’s 
juveniles, the direction and photog- 
raphy are good, and the actors are 
just great. I mean, it’s only a kids’ 
show, you shouldn’t expect 
perfection — but I wish to hell they’d 
had shows like this when / was a 
kid. I hope it hasn’t been killed for 
being too good by the time you read 
this; check your T.V. listings for 
the time in your viewing area. 

Okay, I confess — I’ve secretly 
got the hots for Korg’s old lady. ★

DIRECTIONS 



Dear Mr. Baen: 

March GALAXY was a fine issue. The 
Tuttle story was good 1984 work and the 
Robinson excellent; the Damay was interest- 
ing, and the latest installment of The Perils 
of Corwin ends with an appropriately intrigu- 
ing cliffhanger. 

It’s the non-fiction that spurs me to write, 
though: Subscribe? The newsstand may cost 
more, but I save frustration. 

Your editorial — true, though you’re too 
sanguine about the importance of reversible 
male sterilization. It will have little effect on 
the main world-wide problem, which is sim- 
ply a desire for large families. 

I don’t always agree with Pournellian 
opinions, though I’ve found his articles very 
interesting lately, but his missile-eating laser 
piece has just about sold me. Well done. 

(Incidentally, a disagreement: he said last 
month that the important, basic part of Veli- 
kovsky’s theories was the prehistoric catas- 
trophe, not the Venus-comet schlock. Well, 
important to whom? To one interested in 
digging fact out of the schlock, maybe. But 
judging from ads for WORLDS IN COLLI- 
SION, the pro-V. article in Analog, and so 
on, that is not what matters to his followers. 
What matters is that (1) the causes for those 
disasters were events that The Science Estab- 
lishment can’t handle, and which thus dis- 
credit it, and (2) the Bible is literally true. 
Both -14 karat drek. These aspects are also 

156 



the most important ones to V’s attackers, 
judging from what gets dumped on most. 
And when the Good Doctor (not your Good 
Doctor) claims, in effect, that these are also 
the most important to V. himself. I’m in- 
clined to back his judgement over Pour- 
nelle’s. In other words — intent on seeing that 
the baby’s not thrown out with the bath- 
water, Dr. Poumelle forgets that most of V.’s 
impact comes from the bathwater.) 

The del Rey piece contains much good 
sense, but also some overly broad state- 
ments. I’d just like to note one — ‘a voluntary 
ghetto is a meaningless noise’ — because it’s 
quite false and so makes his first three pages 
largely irrelevant. ‘Ghetto’ can be used in a 
sense like ‘an in-group that builds walls 
around itself; such a use is sanctioned by 
Webster’s Third, and I recently met it in a 
1935 book; and most important, it is so used 
by many (most?) who talk of an ‘SF ghetto’. 
It’s not fair to ignore what people clearly do 
mean for what (you think) their words should 
mean; when the facts are against you, it’s 
worse. 

Yours truly, 
Philip M. Cohen

PS. I’ve learned my tastes and Sturgeon’s 
are parsecs apart, but I bet a lot of people 
who haven’t learned similar lessons will re- 
ally be disappointed by DHALGREN. 



Subscription fulfillment is being returned to 
Boulder, Colorado in the near future, at 
which time service will become even prompt- 
er and more reliable than it is now. (For 
some reason subs, have increased enor- 
mously in the last year or so . .) I think what 
annoys Lester (& me too!) about the 
' ghetto-izing’ of sf is the semantic end-run 
which all too often follows. The term is in- 
troduced into discourse in the sense of ' ‘vol- 
untary in-group" and about three para- 
graphs later the writer starts using words like 
'escape' ; it's also not fair for a writer to ig- 
nore the previous meanings of his own 
words! 



GALAXY 




Dear Mr. Baen; 

I have just finished reading Lester del 
Rey’s article in the March issue of 
GALAXY. I must admit that I heartily agree 
with the points he made, particularly in ref- 
erence to science fiction as escapist litera- 
ture. I, like many others, have long accepted 
the idea of science fiction being primarily 
escapist without really considering what I 
was “escaping” to. Any literature that de- 
mands that the reader enter and accept many 
new ways of looking at the world, as Mr. 
del Rey says, is far from being escapist. 

1 very much enjoyed Phyllis Eisenstein’s 
“Tree of Life”. I would like to say that it 
“sort of grew on me,” but I won’t, as I 
abhor bad puns. Keep up the good work! 

Best Wishes, 
Michael A. Banks 

P.O. Box 312 
Milford, OH 45150 

/, too, abhor puns — especially those of the 
grewsome variety. 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I deeply regret that Mr Del Rey took my 
parody of “Golden Age” sf as a personal 
slam. [“The Siren Song of Academe,” 
March ’75 Galaxy. — Ed.] I never read any- 
thing of Mr Del Rey’s involving lean 
bronzed captains, squeaking maidens, and 
Gloobian Slime Monsters. Never. In fact I 
made up the Slime Monsters myself. 

Mr Del Rey writes: “. .the mouthings of 
the crypto-Marxists (it is a purely Marxist 
doctrine that all art must serve other func- 
tions than ‘mere’ art — this is an idea foreign 
to all previous conceptions of artistic 
merit.). .” 

“It is a purely Marxist doctrine. It 
is? Is Mr Del Rey maybe confusing Marx 
with Stalin? A bit like confusing Jefferson 
with Nixon. 

“This is an idea foreign to all previous 
conceptions. .” It is? Well, look, may I 
drag in the Palace of Versailles for a minute. 
Most people who see it, and its gardens, find 
it a stunning work of art. Who built it, and 
why? Louis XIV had it built, as a deliber- 
ately overwhelming symbol or statement of 

directions 



the grandeur and power concentrated in the 
person of the owner, the King by Divine 
Right, himself. He knew that the better the 
art, the more effective the statement; he had 
taste, the jerk, and hired only the best artists. 
Or take a rather subtler example: Handel’s 
Messiah. Is the Messiah art for art’s sake? I 
think Handel would have said it was art used 
in the service of God. Is that “crypto- 
Marxism”? 

My impression is, in fact, that art for art’s 
sake, art conceived of as free of all obliga- 
tion except to itself, is the recent idea. That 
art is an action done in service to, or in 
homage to, or as a function of, some intense 
belief or great idea, is the older, and proba- 
bly still more general assumption. To con- 
fuse that idea of art with theories of ideolog- 
ical manipulation is disastrous; you end up 
with Propaganda here, Escapsim there — and 
Art nowhere at all. 

Finally, after stating that there never was 
and is not now such a thing as an sf ghetto, 
Mr Del Rey tells us crypto-academic types, 
“Get out of my ghetto!” Only in sf can you 
get ordered to get out of a non-existent ghet- 
to. Science Fiction, I love you. 

Yours faithfully, 
Ursula K. Le Guin 

/ suspect that Lester (he may have somewhat 
more to say on this later) did not so much 
take “Escape Routes" [Dec. '74 Galaxy] 
as a personal slam as an editorial 
springboard for expressing his own, diver- 
gent views . Personally t agree with you 
that sf may indeed serve a didactic role — and I 
agree with Lester that it need not serve such 
a purpose, or any other than its own. And sf 
loves you right back. 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

Whatever happened to Jerry Pournelle’s 
great scoop in the January issue? You know, 
the one about black holes. Well, I haven’t 
found anything about the existence of “tiny” 
black holes being disproved anywhere. I 
thought that by now other magazines would 
have caught up and heard about it. Can you 
please clear this problem up. Are there small 

157 




black holes, or not? 



Sincerely yours, 
Dorian Winterfield 

P.S. I have recently read Black Holes by 
John Taylor. Does the disprovence of small 
black holes mean that black holes can’t be 
used for all those fantastic things like time 
travel, switching universes, etc ? 

Jerry’s reply: 

There was a lengthy article on the subject 
of. quantum black holes in the January issue of 
SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN; thus GALAXY, 
being on the stands a little before S.A., did 
indeed have a beat, although not perhaps as 
long a lead time one as I would have liked. 

I don't expect to see much in the scientific 
journals for another couple of months; their 
lead times are very long, 6 months to a year. 

Mr. Taylor’s rather mystical treatment of 
black holes is indeed interesting. As to using 
black holes for time travel and switching 
universes, as I stated in my GALAXY arti- 
cles the whole thing is not only theoretical, 
but also requires that you find a hole large 
enough to go through without being squashed 
by the very high gravity near the singularity. 
That turns out to be a hole about the size of 
a galaxy; stellar sized holes just don’t seem 
to be usable as a means of transport. What 
would come out in an alternate universe (as- 
suming the purely mathematical exercise that 
leads us to suspect the existence of the alter- 
nate universe in the first place) would be a 
stream of atomic particles, not well or- 
ganized; I cannot see how, anyone would 
survive the trip. 

But then I've been wrong in the past. 

Very small sized black holes wouldn’t 
have been useful for time or space travel to 
begin with, so Hawking’s work disproving 
tiny holes hasn’t changed anything in that 
department. 

Thank you again for writing. 

Best regards, 
Jerry Poumelle, Ph.D 

Dear Editor 

I found Ms. Henye Meyer’s letter (Match 
issue) most fascinating and I admit to feeling 

158 



a certain sense of kinship with her “arro- 
gant” husband who apparently feels Science 
Fiction to be not quite as great an Art form 
as many SF writers claim. I would in fact 
tend to agree with him that most SF is not 
exactly great literature and a good deal is 
suitable only for reading on tedious train 
trips. 

Ms Meyer, however, does not seem to 
realize that the fact that a piece of great SF 
may be of literary merit does not necessarily 
detract from its absolute value. "Finnegan’s 
Wake” is great literature but it has little im- 
pact on those who read it and its absolute 
value to humanity is small. In contrast Doc 
Smith’s “Lensman” series is in literary 
terms quite clearly tripe (a misnomer for bad 
writing as tripe tastes delicious!) but with its 
tremendous impact on its readers and with 
the pleasure it has given to millions it must 
be rated highly in terms of absolute value. 
Occasionally a book surfaces with literary 
and absolute value — H.G. Wells’ “The Time 
Machine” — but the two do not necessarily 
coincide and the genre of SF though it can 
exist happily without literary values cannot 
exist without absolute values. 

SF needs committed readers who enjoy 
every word they read and who live to some 
extent in the fantasies they encounter. The 
popularity of costume parties at SF conven- 
tions, the existence of “Trekkies” and the 
prevalence of Fanzines are not accidents, they 
merely express the will of the people. Keep 
on writing Ms. Meyer, don’t mind if your 
husband thinks it’s trash in literary terms. 
Keep in mind that the basic value of an SF 
story is the pleasure it gives the reader. 
Literary elegance is merely “gilding refined 
gold”. 

Sincerely yours. 
Dr. A. Meyer 

Knowing better than to insert himself be- 
tween husband and wife, the Editor maintains 
a discrete silence! 

Dear Editor, 

I was compelled to write this letter about 
your editorial in the March issue. You seem 

GALAXY 




to think that we have a clear path and that 
we will soon be free of the threat of nuclear 
attack or of overpopulation. You show the 
attitude of many people; faith in “American 
know-how! You put an awful lot of faith in 
things which are “virtual certanties.” That 
makes me recall something about chickens 
and eggs. 

You claim that people know all about our 
problems, this is so far from the truth it is 
sad. Sad because we do have know-how and 
the means to solve our problems, but people 
can never get together on anything. It always 
seems to be our emotions which stop us from 
getting together and solving our problems; 
greed, hate, fear, and of course pride. AH 
too often our knowledge is used to find ways 
to kill people, unfortunately I do not see any 
reason why we would suddenly change now. 

Perhaps what our sf writers are trying to 
tell us is that we are not God’s Chosen 
People, that we do not always have to solve 
all our problems and that we are not as great 
as we think we are. 

Maybe if we stopped reaching for our 
“Rightful Place” we would look down and 
see how little we have progressed from the 
caves. 

Yours truly, 
Ed Sloma 

144 Main St. 

Bing. N.Y. 13905 

No, what I said was that we do indeed have 
a fair chance of survival-in-style — if and 
only if we behave with a modicum of 
intelligence — and that the Galaxy Readership 
wants, deserves, and shall have non- 
nightmarish stories replete with plots and 
realistic resolutions thereof. And it's not our 
distance from the caves (though we've come 
a long way, baby) that’s at issue, but what 
we’ve brought with us — like our prediliction 
for strong, numb-skulled leaders whose re- 
sponse to a difficult problem is to pick up a 
club. 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

While in many ways I agree with Alter- 
Ego’s complaints in your Feb. ’75 issue (his 



complaints about SF, of course. I wouldn’t 
know about his other problems.), I also 
agree with your insert. You do publish stories 
that are very good to read. For this reason I 
am going to subscribe to Galaxy (Worlds of 

io. 

I also wanted to tell you how much I en- 
joyed Dr. Poumelle’s article. Perhaps you 
can justify Archaeology as the feature arti- 
cle occasionally on the basis of time travel. 
For example, if I’d known more about the 
Icelandic Sagas, I would have enjoyed Harry 
Harrison's “The Technicolor Time 
Machine” even more. I imagine the way he 
fit the story to the sagas was really clever if 
I knew enough to appreciate it. 

I hope your magazine prospers and con- 
tinues to print stories that are good to read. 

Sincerely, 
Marjorie Task 

4944 Queensbury Rd. 

Dayton, OH 45424 

Take that, Alter! 

Dear Sirs, 

Thanks for giving GALAXY a new per- 
sonality. The emphasis now seems to lie on 
good solid writing and each issue is well 
rounded now. Of your artists I especially like 
Steve Fabian — get him to do some covers 
please. I also like an occasional astronomical 
cover — so please keep David Hardy, too. 
He’s the best man in the field now. Authors 
I would like to read (go on reading) in 
GALAXY are (among others): Arthur 
Clarke, Jack Williamson, Fred Pohl, Colin 
Kapp, George R.R. Martin, Leigh Brackett, 
Poul Anderson, Ursula LeGuin, Fritz 
Leiber. 

Well, keep it up, Mr. Baen — you’re stead- 
ily winning new friends. 

All the best, 
Uwe Luserke

When your application (or membership 
is accepted, you’ll receive your intro- 
ductory package of four books for just 
10# (plus shipping and handling). You 
may examine them in your home, and il 
not completely satisfied, return them 
within ten days — membership will be 
cancelled and you'll owe nothing. 

About every 4 weeks (14 times a year), 
we’ll send you the Club’s bulletin, 
Things to Como, describing the 2 com- 
ing Selections and a variety of Alternate 
choices. If you want both Selections, 
you need do nothing; they’ll be shipped 
automatically. If you don't want a Selec- 
tion, or prefer an Alternate, or no book 
at all, just fill out the convenient form 
always provided, and return it to us by 
the date specified. We try lo allow you 
at least ten days for making your deci- 
sion. If you do not receive the form in 
time to respond within 10 days, and re- 
ceive an unwanted selection, you may 
return it at our expense. 

As a member you need take only 4 Se- 
lections or Alternates during the com- 
ing year. You may resign any time 
thereafter, or remain a member as long 
as you wish. Most books cost only 



$1.98 plus shipping and handling. Oc- 
casionally, extra-value selections are 
slightly higher but always much less 
than Publishers’ Editions.
