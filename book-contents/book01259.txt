To paraphrase Alice in Wonder- 
land: “The science fiction writing 
business gets curiouser and curi- 
ouser.” We’ve often been entranced 
by the professions which writers 
pursue for their livelihood. Beside 
professional writers of television 
and movie scripts, we have doctors, 
engineers, university professors who 
teach everything from biophysics to 
ancients languages, anthropologists, 
insurance investigators, advertising 
men, lawyers, chemists and news- 
papermen. However, two writers 
who are new to IP’s pages are 
unique even in such distinguished 
company. Lloyd Biggie, Jr. (who 
wrote Silence is Deadly for this is- 
sue; and is also responsible for The 
Tunesmiths and On The Dotted 
Line) is the only writer we know 
of who has a PhD in music. He 
claims the longest epic he ever 
wrote was a 450 page thesis on 
Antonius Brumel the 15th century 
composer. However, he doesn’t feel 
that this is exactly a direct ap- 
proach to becoming a science fic- 
tion writer! Harry Lorayne, who 



wrote what we think is a nice sa- 
tiric little comment on our TV- 
ridden lives (The Poors), was un- 
til a few years ago considered one 
of the top card manipulating ma- 
gicians in the country. Now mem- 
ory is his business. He spends most 
of his time traveling around the 
country doing lecture demonstra- 
tions on what can be done with a 
trained memory. This, incidentally, 
includes remembering the names 
and faces of his entire audience 
after meeting them only once; 
memorizing the order of an entire 
deck of cards which has been shuf- 
fled by a volunteer; memorizing 
the entire issue of any chosen cur- 
rent magazine, etc. He’s so good 
at it that he’s been featured in 
Ripley’s Believe It Or Not column! 

Collecting such oddities about our 
authors brings another thought to 
mind, one which most editors won- 
der about — What about our read- 
ers? What do they do? Why do 
they read science fiction? What 
makes you, the reader, pluck IF 
from the newsstands? We’d really 
like to compile a list of statistics 
concerning you. Too many people 
still suffer from “shame” about 
needing to defend science fiction 
as their favorite reading matter; 
and we’d like to print some rebut- 
tals to help both science fiction and 
them. Drop us a note, tell us what 
you do, what hobbies you pursue, 
what you like in science fiction and 
what makes you buy IF. Is it writ- 
ers whose yarns you know you’ll 
like? Is it covers? (That, of course, 
brings up the point about just what 
sort of illustrations you do like on 



2 




your covers.) How would you feel 
about no illustrations at all? How 
about featured articles like the re- 
cent Face of Mars by Dr. Richard- 
son or the one about Why Guided 
Missiles Can Not Be Controlled? 
We’ll print statistics as they come 
in — bet you’ll be suqDrised to find 
what distinguished company you 
keep when you read IF. As an 
added incentive to make you take 
pen, pencil, crayon or quill in 
hand, we’ll send a first edition of 
IF to the first one hundred letter 
writers. 

We\e had so many favorable com- 
ments on our FIRST WORLD OF 
IF anthology (reader comments, 
newspaper and magazine reviews) 
that we’re planning another one 
real soon — a “second world.” This 
time, we plan to reprint novelettes 
from our first six years. Some of 
our readers have already sent in 
suggestions about which ones they’d 
like to see. 

Frank Riley, who’s been absent 
from IF’s pages for far too long 
(busy as a beaver with TV and 
movie assignments) has sent us an 
unusual story for the December is- 
sue. A Computer Named Eddie is 
the title, and Eddie and his inventor 
are something really unique in de- 
tective teams. A missing X-15 
guided missile and plenty of red 
tape and security problems all 
promise something exciting and 
new in the realm of science fiction. 
So don’t miss A Computer Named 
Eddie! 

Bob Silverberg (the man with the 



13 by-lines and more than 170 
stories to his credit) is also pound- 
ing away on a new short novel for 
IF. Incidentally, Bob, who writes 
full time himself, has as a spouse 
one of the few female electronics 
engineers extant in the United 
States. 

If you're planning to be in New 
York City at all within the next 
month or two, make it a sp>ecial 
p>oint to see A Visit to a Small 
Planet at the Booth Theater. You 
may have seen it on TV, but for a 
science fiction fan the expanded 
version is a must. It’s a smash hit 
even on hard-bitten Broadway. 
Take Aunt Matilda too, because 
even the most determined anti sci- 
ence-fictioneer will be delighted 
with Cyril Ritchard and Eddie 
Mayehoff. After the black eye 
science fiction got with Night of 
the Auk a recent Broadway flop, 
this play with its delightful whimsy 
and humor may take the curse off 
for a good many years to come. 
Let’s hope that Hollywood picks 
this one up (including Ritchard 
and Mayehoff) and gives everyone 
a chance to see what good enter- 
tainment science fiction can be. 

Our June cover has started what 
seems to be an interesting little 
controversy in several quarters. The 
picture was titled “Kodachrome 
from the Files of the First Mars 
Expedition,” and showed theoreti- 
cal ships about to make a landing 
on the red planet. So far we’ve had 
several letters in which people want 
to know why the government has

What was the secret weapon of this primitive planet where 
people lived in mute terror? No earthman had ever seen 
it, and there was but one way to find out . 




DEADLY 



BY LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



I T WAS AN inter-galactic crisis, 
with border clashes between 
the Federation and the menacing 
Haarvian Empire strewing space 
with searing debris and threatening 
to erupt into total war. The War 
Department of the Federation pin- 
pointed the critical area, pinpointed 
the critical planet, and requested 
permission to act. The politicians 



refused. And while the admirals 
chaffed angrily and the politicians 
fussed helplessly, Space Intelligence 
went to work with its usual quiet 
efficiency. 

Space Intelligence sent in agents, 
one at a time, and in twos and 
threes — specialists and non-special- 
ists, bold youngsters and wily vet- 
erans, professionals and uniquely- 



5 




qualified amateurs. And one at a 
time, and by twos and threes they 
disappeared without a trace. Space 
Intelligence lost seventeen men in 
two months, and then it called in 
Bran Hilford. 

“You’ll have to go native,” he 
was told. “It’ll require some sur- 
gery.” 

Hilford grinned happily. In his 
forty years with Space Intelligence, 
he’d had his body reshaped in more 
ways than he cared to remember. 
He’d had ears, nose and mouth 
altered and re-altered. His head 
had been egg-shaped, balloon- 
shaped, and square. The irises of 
his eyes had been tinted a dozen 
different colors. As a veteran of 
missions on two hundred worlds, 
he knew that anything was com- 
monplace under at least one sun. 
“Go ahead,” he said, “and butcher 
me up.” 

And they did. 

During the curious convales- 
cence that followed, Hilford became 
increasingly puzzled about his new 
assignment. He asked for details, 
and got nothing. “No one here is 
qualified to indoctrinate you,” he 
was told. “We have an expert 
coming, and you’ll go back with 
him. He’ll give you as much as he 
can in space. It won’t be enough, 
and you’ll probably get killed, but 
there’s a crisis . .” 

Hilford shrugged patiently. He 
lounged about with hands and 
head swathed in bandages. He 
could hear only with a communica- 
tor clapped tightly against his 
head, the volume turned up to what 
should have been an ear-shattering 
level. He could not account for the 

6 



peculiar feeling in his hands. Be- 
cause there was nothing else for 
him to do, he waited and said 
nothing, and eventually the day 
came when his bandages could be 
removed. 

Hilford sat stiffly on the edge of 
his bed, hands extended in front 
of him. A pretty young nurse deft- 
ly peeled the bandages from his 
hands. A second nurse, not so 

pretty, shot curious glances at him 
as she unrolled yards of bandage 
from his head. The doctor hovered 
nearby, his round face puckered 
anxiously. Hilford saw his lips 

move, and heard nothing. 

He had confidently assumed that 
his hearing would improve as the 
bandages came off. It did not. 

Silence enveloped and stifled him. 
A pair of surgical scissors slipped 
from nervous fingers, and fell with 
noiseless impact. The doctor, danc- 
ing about apprehensively, over- 
turned a chair, and Hilford’s eyes 
followed it as it crashed soundlessly. 
He coughed, and let the word, 
“Damn!” explode from his lips. 

He heard neither. 

The last of the bandages dropped 
away, and the nurses stepped back. 
The doctor bounded forward, 
gripped Hilford’s head firmly, and 
studied it critically. Hilford waited 
submissively, felt the doctor’s skill- 
ful fingers prodding his head, felt 
his own hands caught up for a 
rapid examination. 

Suddenly the doctor backed 
away, grinning. The nurses grinned. 
The three of them stood together, 
lips moving excitedly, hands gestur- 
ing. Hilford moved his hands, as 
though to push aside the void of 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




silence that surrounded him. 

His hands. Left hand, thumb and 
five fingers. Right hand, thumb and 
five fingers. He examined the extra 
fingers with studious bewilderment, 
tried to move them, and gaped at 
the stiff response. 

A nurse thrust a mirror in front 
of him. The reflection stared back 
at him — his face, but not his face. 
“Damn!” he bellowed, and the 
word dropped into nothingness. 
His face stretched smooth and un- 
broken from the point of his chin 
to the taut dome of his bald head. 
His ears were gone. 

Hilford lurched to his feet and 
advanced angrily. The doctor 
dropped his arms and stood help- 
lessly before him, pink face wrinkled 
with merriment. The nurses 
clutched their sides as laughter 
shook their trim bodies. Hilford 
watched them, strained against 
the noiseless impact of their laugh- 
ter, and finally slumped dejectedly 
back onto his bed. 

Ernst Wilkes, the Sector Chief 
of Intelligence, moved his bulky 
figure into the room, stood for a 
moment regarding Hilford, and 
dismissed the doctor and nurses 
with a gesture. He tossed Hilford 
a communicator, and tested a chair 
apprehensively before he settled his 
weight upon it. 

“Where are my ears?” Hilford 
demanded. 

Wilkes’ wheezy voice floated 
faintly, far away. “Deep freeze. You 
can have them back when you 
finish this assignment. If you finish 
it. If you want them back, that 
is. You’ll be two pounds lighter 
without those atmosphere flaps, 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



and you might find — I just got in. 
Sorry I had to be away when you 
reported here. Know anything 
about Kamm?” 

Hilford started. “The silent 
planet. So that’s why I lost my 
ears!” 

“Right. Sense of hearing is 
atrophied in all life forms. They’ve 
even lost the external vestiges of 
any hearing apparatus.” 

Hilford searched his memory. 
“Kamm — never been in that sector. 
The natives have some kind of odd 
religious cult, haven’t they? Rep- 
tiles?” 

“Birds. Wish I could tell you 
about it, but I can’t. There aren’t 
many experts on Kamm, and we’ve 
just lost some of our best men. 
You’ll get as much as there is time 
for on the ship. Zorrel just got in, 
and he’s to go back with you. He’s 
waiting now. Ready to leave?” 
“Ready as I’ll ever be.” 

Wilkes grunted, and struggled to 
his feet. “I’m giving you six 
months leave when you finish this. 
But you’ll probably get killed.” 

At the space port, Wilkes intro- 
duced Hilford to Mark Zorrel, 
who was young, six-fingered, and 
earless. “He’s in charge of you 
until you reach Kamm. The main 
problem will be language, and he’ll 
see that you get that, and as much 
else as there’s time for. Once you 
land, you’re in full charge. Zorrel 
will act as your assistant.” 
Hilford shook the communicator 
gently, and returned it to his head. 
“Give me that again. Who’s in 
charge of what?” 

“Oh, hell,” Wilkes said. “We 

7 




have a base on a Kamm moon. 
You’ll get your orders there. Get 
aboard, now, and — luck.” He 
waddled away. 

“Take good care of my ears,” 
Hilford called after him. He 
turned to Zorrel. “Let’s get on 
with it.” 

Zorrel shook his head, and 
grinned. He spread his hands in 
front of Hilford, and the twelve 
fingers flashed bewilderingly. Final- 
ly he spoke, in the harsh, expression- 
less tones of an unused voice. 

“The language of Kamm. Gom- 
mimicators are much too uncer- 
tain, and too inconvenient, if those, 
doctors did any job at all on your 
ears. I’ll tell you as much as I can 
when you’ve learned how to talk.” 

Hilford followed Zorrel up the 
ramp, stiffly and doubtfully ex- 
ercising his two newly-acquired 
fingers. 



T hey landed on Kamm at 
night, in a rolling meadow 
near the sea, and dawn found them 
toiling along a rough, winding 
coastal road. They plodded beside 
a clumsy wooden peddler’s cart, 
drawn by a shaggy, stupid, ox-like 
animal that Hilford’s mind called 
an ox because he knew no verbal 
equivalent for the Kammian sign 
language. They wore baggy trou- 
sers and short capes, so startlingly 
colored that Hilford’s hands had 
been too paralyzed to comment on 
them when he first saw them. They 
wore the squat, scarlet hats ^at 
were the Kammian badge of their 
profession. 

They were itinerant peddlers, 



one of the two Kammian classes — 
outside of the nobility and the 
wealthiest merchants — that could 
travel about freely. Seamen made 
up the other class, but an intelli- 
gence agent disguised as a seaman 
worked under a decided handicap. 
He was bound to attract attention 
if he got very far inland. 

As soon as it was light enough 
to see each other’s hands, they 
began to tdk. “Damned barbarous 
civilization,” Hilford signaled, 
“when you can’t talk in the dark.” 

He found this sign language the 
worst thing he’d encountered in all 
of his intelligence service. It had 
grammar, even an uncomfortably 
rigid syntax. Some words — names, 
places, important artifacts — had a 
single sign or gesture. Others were 
literally spelled out. Hilford floun- 
dered at every turn because he had 
to keep thinking of verbal equiva- 
lents for what he was talking about. 

And what should he call this 
Province? The Flat Province, from 
the Kammian gesture; but it was 
rolling country, and even moun- 
tainous farther inland. And what 
should he call its ruler? The sign 
for ruler he interpreted as “Duke”, 
and the erect second and sixth 
fingers on the right hand made the 
ruler of the Flat Province the Duke 
Two Fingers. It was screwy, but it 
was the only way he could keep 
things straight. 

Zorrel’s young face, good-look- 
ing despite its lack of ears, was 
frowning critically. His hands 
moved slowly, with a sarcastic 
flourish. “You’re still talking with 
one hell of a foreign accent. Don’t 
bend your sixth finger like that. 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



8 




It puts the whole thing in a kind 
of familiar tense, and that’s a rank 
insult when you talk with a 
stranger.” 

Hilford straightened the offend- 
ing finger. “I was wondering if 
this stuff could be derived from 
a spoken language.” 

^rrel’s hands spoke peevishly. 
“Scholars have been arguing about 
that for years. Me, I let them 
argue.” 

Hilford exercised his fingers 
thoughtfully. The idea that he 
could be tripped up on such a 
minor matter as a bent finger — 
that any Kammian peasant might 
spot him instantly as an alien — 
was highly disturbing. He would 
have to let Zorrel run things for a 
few days, until he became wiser 
in the ways of Kamn. He would 
have to stay in the background — 
and keep his hands shut. 

“Let’s get back to geography,” 
Zorrel’s fingers signaled. “Show me 
the capital cities of the twelve 
provinces. And watch that accent.” 
They talked busily, reviewing 
names and places. 

At mid-morning they topped a 
steep hill and looked down on the 
great and prosperous city of 00. 
It was market day, and half of the 
ten thousand population seemed to 
be thronging the market place that 
sprawled along the harbor. Zorrel’s 
remarks changed abruptly to the 
brisk chatter of peddlers as they 
met their first passers-by, and they 
moved on into the market place. 

They backed their cart into place 
at the end of a long row of peddlers’ 
carts, and Zorrel, with a wink and 
a shrug, began to display his mer- 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



chandise to the people who had al- 
ready gathered to see what the new 
cart had brought. Hilford stood 
nearby, pushed his scarlet peddler’s 
hat farther back on his b^d head, 
and struggled heroically to keep 
from gaping at the scene spread out 
before him. 

He was surrounded by a riot of 
color. Bold, iridescent patterns or- 
namented each woman’s billowing 
skirt and contrasted with the rich, 
dark tones of the loose-fitting 
bodices. The men’s clothing, from 
the baggy, full-length trousers to the 
short capes, was a startling maze 
of lurid, irregular stripes and 
jagged, multicolored lines. Children 
followed along sedately, amusing 
miniatures of their parents. 

Each man wore the brightly- 
colored, distinctive headdress of 
his trade. The woman of 00 wore 
no hat, but her long, flowing hair 
was a bewildering rainbow stirring 
gently in the tangy sea air. Hilford 
reminded himself for the hundredth 
time not to stare, and stared again, 
wondering if the women dyed each 
hair individually. 

The peddlers’ carts, the stalls, 
the stubby, rectangular sails that 
were barely visible above the low- 
lying, barge-like ships in the har- 
bor beyond the market place, the 
houses and shops of 00 that could 
be seen in the distance, even the 
cobblestones underfoot — all were 
a tumult of color, some loud and 
gaudy, some exquisitely patterned 
masterpieces of sensitive shading 
and contrast. 

The faces of the people were 
solemn, almost sullen, among the 
gay surroundings. Hilford watched 

9 




for a long time before he grasped 
an answer, and then he saw the 
explanation in every gesture, in 
every hesitant purchase, in every 
pale face. These people were 
frightened. Even the children were 
frightened. 

Most awesome of all was the 
silence. Hilford found himself 
straining to hear the hum of the 
crowd, the shouts, the piercing 
cries of the hawkers, the murmuring 
conversation — and he heard noth- 
ing. Wooden shoes clapped noise- 
lessly on the cobblestones. Women 
and peddlers haggled with sound- 
less gestures. Itinerant musicians, 
such a prominent feature of market 
places on many worlds, were not 
to be found. Instead, there were 
shabby performers shaping whirl- 
ing discs of color into exotic pat- 
terns for small groups of towns- 
people who watched intently, but 
did not applaud. 

Kamm, the silent planet. Silence 
hung heavily about Hilford. So 
fantastic did it seem as he watched 
the slow-moving crowds, watched 
the triangular-shaped metal coins 
fall noiselessly onto the hawkers’ 
trays, watched a battered hand cart 
being wheeled past without a single 
creak or rattle, watched insects 
buzzing in furious silence over a 
soggy pile of sea mollusks, that he 
felt compelled to cry out himself. 

But he knew the sound would 
drop from his lips unheard. 

The sight of a black cape 
startled Hilford into alertness. 
Soldier, policeman — they were one 
and the same on Kamm, and their 
black clothing and black, fur- 

10 



trimmed hats made them stand out 
sharply among the brightly-ap- 
pareled populace. This Black-Cape 
walked slowly past, whirled sud- 
denly to stare curiously, and then 
stopped a short distance away with 
his eyes fixed intently upon Hilford. 

“Well, now,” HilJFord told him- 
self. “A peddler on market day 
who stands around gaping and does 
not peddle is not behaving normal- 
ly, and Blackie spotted that with 
one glance. It may be a primitive 
planet, but the police aren’t 
stupid!” 

He glanced at Zorrel, who was 
working with enthusiasm but not 
much success to sell hand-carved 
figurines of the hideous Kanunian 
Holy Bird to the passers-by. Hilford 
caught Zorrel’s eye, winked, and 
sauntered out to lose himself in 
the crowd. He carried with him 
Zorrel’s warning frown. 

“It wouldn’t do for me to try to 
peddle,” he mused, “but there’s 
nothing wrong with my looking 
over the wares of my competitors. 
All the peddlers are doing that.” 

He moved with the crowd, mak- 
ing an enormous circle of the 
market place, and began to work 
in towards the center. The sun 
was high overhead, and his pangs 
of hunger prodded him into action. 
He stopped to buy some pastry, 
and after due hesitation also had 
a mess of seaweed measured out 
for him. It was one of the penalties 
of his profession. To masquerade 
as a native, he had to eat — and ap- 
parently enjoy — native food. Tuck- 
ing his purchases under his arm, 
he walked on towards the center of 
the market place, where the fab- 

LLOYD biggie; JR. 




nlous Karamian Holy Bird floated 
life-like at the top of a thirty-foot 
pillar. 

Metal or stone, it was — Hilford 
could not decide, because it was 
painted in dazzling colors. It was 
the most vicious bird of prey Hil- 
ford had seen on any of his two 
hundred worlds. Its wings spanned 
a good ten feet from tip to tip, its 
eyes gleamed wickedly, its knife- 
like talons were poised to clutch 
and tear, and the huge, tapering 
beak was drawn back to strike. 

Hilford stared at it, and shud- 
dered. According to legend, he 
knew, such birds were once the 
rulers of Kamm. According to leg- 
end, they still existed somewhere 
on Kamm’s single continent. But 
Space Intelligence agents had never 
seen one, nor found a citizen of 
Kamm who had seen one. The 
bird’s heavy shadow seemed sym- 
bolic, in that market place of the 
Flat Province, where the citizens 
lived in mute, brightly-colored ter- 
ror. 

Glancing back, Hilford saw the 
Black-Gape again, this time moving 
towards him purposefully. Hilford 
uneasily threaded his way through 
the crowd, and tried to move fast- 
er. “It’s this peddler’s hat,” he told 
himself. “They could spot a ped- 
dler a mile away.” But there was 
compensation. He could also spot 
a Black-Gape from a good distance. 
He pushed his way forward, and 
when he looked back again the 
Black-Gap>e had given up the chase 
and was standing respectfully at 
attention. At the same time the 
crowd began to draw back in alarm. 

A luxurious, gaudy carriage 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



moved slowly across the market 
place, pulled by two of the ox-like 
creatures. Behind it staggered a 
man of Kamm, his nude body 
painted gruesomely, and behind 
him marched ranks of the black- 
caped police, solemnly swinging 
their sabers. 

Hilford had to give way with 
the crowd and humbly avert his 
eyes, but he had time to survey the 
scene before him and mentally 
photograph the occupants of the 
carriage. 

One was the notorious Duke 
Two Fingers, who lounged in re- 
splendent black robes and kept his 
bloated, evil face staring disdain- 
fully straight ahead. The appear- 
ance of the other occupant brought 
Hilford up short in amazement and 
forced him to risk another glance 
at the carriage. He was a huge, 
rough-looking man in native dress, 
but he had one physical attribute 
which stamped him unmistakably 
as alien to the planet of Kamm. He 
had ears. 

The police strapped their victim 
to the pillar, and their ranks filed 
past him in orderly manner, each 
man swinging his saber. The vic- 
tim writhed in soundless agony as 
blood dripped from a multitude of 
slashing cuts in his back. The Duke 
Two Fingers and his companion 
watched impassively, but the citi- 
zens began to edge cautiously away. 
The market place thinned out, and 
Hilford could see crowds of peo- 
ple moving up the narrow streets of 
00, towards home. 

Hilford moved on, and another 
glance over his shoulder showed 
him that Black-Gape was following 

n 




him again. His hands seemed to be 
si^aling somethin?. Was Hilford 
being ordered to halt? Other Black- 
Gapes were closing in on the mar- 
ket place, questioning the citizens, 
questioning the peddlers, scowling 
suspiciously at everyone. Hilford 
made his way towards the far side 
of the market place, along the har- 
bor, where the Black-Capes seemed 
fewer. 

A Kammian directly ahead of 
him staggered suddenly, spun 
around, and clutched his arm, pain 
mingling with astonishment in his 
face. A dull red began to obliter- 
ate the gay colors of his shirt sleeve, 
and a brightly plumed dart pro- 
truded from his arm. 

With reflexes long trained to 
alertness, Hilford was running be- 
fore his mind had completely 
grasped what was happening. A 
man’s purple hat fell to the ground 
in front of him, a dart embedded 
in it. Hilford ran at a crouch to 
make himself a smaller target, and 
his mind thundered angrily, “The 
dogs! Shoot in a crowded market 
place with women and children 
about!” 

Darts were whizzing past from 
several directions when he reached 
the last line of peddlers’ carts. The 
peddlers gaped, and frantically 
dove for cover. A dart caught m 
Hilford’s cape as he slipped be- 
tween two carts. He hurdled a low 
stone wall, and found himself on 
the narrow quay, barren except for 
an occasional, weather-worn stor- 
age shack. It was a dead end, a 
natural trap. There was no hiding 
place. 

Hilford did not hesitate. He 



ducked into the sheltering shadow 
of a storage shack, crossed the quay 
in three leaping strides, dove to the 
deck of a ship, and crept quickly 
behind the stubby cabin. 

He plucked the dart from his 
sleeve and tossed it overboard. 
From the lining of his cape he pro- 
duced a green seaman’s hat. The 
peddler’s hat was quickly concealed 
in the cape. He had lost the sea- 
weed somewhere along the way, but 
he still clutched the pastry. He set- 
tled himself on a bench in the stem 
of the ship, a piece of pastry in each 
hand, and munched calmly as he 
watched the choppy waves come 
rippling across the bay towards him. 

The ship was evidently a fishing 
boat, and its stench was overpow- 
ering. The silence was nerve- 
wracking. When they came — ^and 
he was certain they would come — 
there would be no warning foot- 
step, no shouted inquiry. Should 
he face the shore, and answer ques- 
tions from a distance? He gambled 
on boldness — ^boldness, and confi- 
dent innocence, and indignation. 

He was leaning back with one 
foot on the low wooden railing, 
completely relaxed, when rough 
hands seized him and jerked him 
erect. Hilford reacted instantane- 
ously, with a rage what w^ not 
feigned. He whirled and charged 
into Black-Cape, shoving him back. 
Then, apparently recognizing the 
costume for the first time, he halted 
and stood his ground, glowering. 

“Where is the peddler?” 

Hilford leered insultingly, and 
spoke as well as he could with the 
pastry clutched in his hands. “A 
sea-going peddler?” 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR.

Black-Cape controlled his anger 
with difficulty. “Have you seen a 
peddler?” 

“Over there,” Hilford said, ges- 
turing towards the market place, “I 
saw a thousand. Here there arc 
none.” 

Black-Gape spun around and 
strode towards the tiny cabin. He 
was out again an instant later, 
hurrying away without another 
glance at Hilford. Hilford returned 
to his bench, leaned back restfully, 
and munched on the pastry. He was 
hungry. 

For two hours Black-Capes 
prowled the quay. Hilford stole un- 
easy glances at them. What had 
gone wrong? He looked like a Kam- 
mian, as far as he knew he acted 
like a Kammian, and yet — one 
glance, and the Black-Cape had 
been after him. It boded no good 
for his mission. 

He muttered a fervent prayer of 
thanks for Zorrel. The extra hat 
had been Zorrel’s idea. The figurine 
of the Kammian Holy Bird that 
Hilford wore around his neck was 
also Zorrel’s idea. Concealed in its 
gaping beak was a miniature stun- 
gun. Clearly Zorrel was a bright 
young agent who could take care 
of himself. And he knew Kamm. 

Black-Gapes were still standing 
watchfully at intervals along the 
quay when Hilford left the ship. 
He did not want to risk explain- 
ing his presence to a returning sea- 
man, and he wanted to reassure 
Zorrel of his safety. If the young 
agent thought Hilford had been 
t^en, he might proceed according 
to some plan of his own, and they 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



would become separated. 

Hilford avoided the Black-Capes, 
exchanged the traditional crossed- 
thumb greeting with a passing sea- 
man, and turned into the market 
place through a break in the stone 
wall. He moved through the first 
row of peddlers’ carts, glanced 
about quickly, and whirled to in- 
terest himself in an innocuous pile 
of ornamental wooden daggers. 

There were more Black-Capes 
than civilians in the market place, 
and thirty feet from Hilford they 
swarmed about Zorrers cart, while 
Zorrel himself was being led pro- 
testingly away. Stealing sidewise 
glances, Hilford saw the Black- 
Gapes kick the ox into position, and 
get the cart started after Zorrel. 
With them, concealed in the cart, 
went the transmitter that was Hil- 
ford’s only means of communica- 
tion with the Space Intelligence 
Base on Kamm’s largest moon. 

He turned his back on the plead- 
ing peddler, and walked towards 
the quay. Ten hours after his ar- 
rival he was alone and helpless on 
this most weird of all weird worlds. 
Staying alive was a secondary mat- 
ter. He had a mission, and he 
scarcely knew how to begin. He sat 
down on the edge of the quay, not 
twenty feet from a stony-faced 
Black-Cape, dangled his feet over 
the water, and searched his mind 
for a plan of action. 

T he FEDERATION’S prob- 
lem on Kanun was a simple 
one — it was trapped in its own 
ethics. No world had ever been co- 
erced into joining the Federation, 

13 




or even into trading with it. When 
the first Federation ships landed on 
Kamm, they were greeted coldly 
and invited to leave. They left 
promptly. 

The Federation continued to 
send periodic missions, and even- 
tually established tenuous trade re- 
lationships. After a hundred and 
seventy-five years, the relationships 
were still tenuous. The Federation 
landed one trading ship each 
month, with a small assortment of 
simple luxury goods for the wealthy 
and the noble. The Federation re- 
ceived in return an assortment of 
hand-manufactured claptrap that 
was promptly jettisoned in space. 
The gesture of friendship was con- 
sidered worth the expense. 

In the meantime, the Federation 
pushed well beyond Kamm, and 
eventually ran headlong into the 
expanding Haarvian Empire. Sud- 
denly it found itself facing a pow- 
erful enemy, and menaced from 
within its boundaries by a strategi- 
cally located hostile and independ- 
ent world. If the Haarvian Empire 
formed an alliance with Kamm, the 
results could be acutely embar- 
rassing — perhaps even disastrous. 

Kamm was a primitive world, 
militarily weak, and the obvious so- 
lution was a fast, ruthless conquest. 
But the very structure of the Fed- 
eration rested upon an abhorrence 
of force. Time might have resolved 
the dilemma, but now the Federa- 
tion had no time. 

Six months before Kamm had 
committed an act of deliberate, 
brutal violence. A Federation trad- 
ing commission, making a routine 
courtesy call upon the most power- 



ful Kammian nobleman, had failed 
to return to its ship. The following 
morning the members of the com- 
mission were found in the streets of 
00 — gruesomely murdered. 

“Unfortunate,” the Duke Two 
Fingers had said. “The^ bandits 
will ...” 

But the Federation disregarded 
the bandits. The murdered men 
were not robbed, and their deaths 
could only have been caused by an 
advanced type of weapon complete- 
ly unknown to the Federation. The 
five members of the commission 
had died simultaneously, and from 
the same cause — a severe cranial 
hemorrhage, with profuse bleeding 
from the nose, mouth and ears. 
There was no sign of external in- 
jury. A painstaking pathological 
examination ruled out poison or 
bacteria. And the use of an un- 
known weapon pointed directly at 
the Haarvian Empire. 

The Federation established a 
base on the largest Kammian moon, 
for Space Intelligence and the 
654th Fleet. A detector screen was 
set up around the planet, and the 
fleet began to make an alarming 
catch of Haarvian reconnaissance 
ships. Space Intelligence had al- 
ways kept a few agents on Kamm, 
for training and study purposes. 
These were ordered into the Flat 
Province, and they promptly disap- 
peared. Space Intelligence sent in 
more agents, and lost them. 

Kamm’s single continent was di- 
vided into twelve provinces, and in 
theory the twelve rulers were 
equals. In fact, one duke complete- 
ly dominated the others through his 
control of a planet-wide police 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



14 




force. His power evidently derived 
from the religion of Kamm, since 
he held the title, Keeper of the 
Bird, and the pwlice — or soldiers — 
of the Bird swore fealty not to the 
man, but to the title. 

The Keeper of the Bird was 
chosen, Space Intelligence believed, 
in some kind of lottery. He held 
that honor for a period roughly five 
years long, determined by the com- 
plicated interaction of Kamm’s 
three moons, and at the end of that 
time, at a place and time shrouded 
in secrecy, the dukes met to choose 
a new Keeper of the Bird. 

The constant shifting of the focal 
p>oint of p>ower had kept peace on 
Kamm for centuries, and preserved 
the independence of the twelve 
provinces. In all of Kamm’s re- 
corded history no duke had ever 
served two consecutive terms as 
Keeper of the Bird — until the Duke 
Two Fingers had received his first 
fifteen years before. He was now 
finishing his third consecutive term, 
and the opinion advanced by Space 
Intelligence was a mere phrasing of 
the obvious. If the Keeper of the 
Bird was actually chosen by lot, the 
Duke Two Fingers had a system. 

Of the twelve dukes, only the 
Duke Two Fingers was openly hos- 
tile to the Federation. It was he 
who was suspected of dealing with 
the Haarvian Empire. It was in his 
Flat Province that the trade com- 
missioners had been murdered and 
the best agents Space Intelligence 
could supply were inexplicably dis- 
appearing. And as Keeper of the 
Bird he could dominate the other 
dukes, and force them to oppose 
the Federation. 



This was the basis for the orders 
that Space Intelligence handed to 
Bran Hilford. Find out when and 
where the dukes meet to choose 
their next Keeper of the Bird. Find 
out how the choice is made. If pos- 
sible, see that the choice does not 
fall to the Duke Two Fingers for a 
fourth consecutive time. Above all 
else, track down the secret weapon 
that the Haarvian Empire has given 
to Kamm. 

“It’s the weapon that bothers us,” 
scholarly-looking Admiral Lantz 
had told Hilford. There were deep 
furrows of worry in his face. 
“Kamm couldn’t trouble us with 
its own resources. We could seal it 
off, and let the diplomats work 
things out. But we don’t dare wait. 
Haarn may have given that weap>on 
to Kamm just to see if we have a 
defence against it. If we don’t come 
up with a solution — quickly — ^we’ll 
have to attack Kamm.” 

“That could be disastrous,” Hil- 
ford said. 

“The government would prob- 
ably fall,” the admiral admitted. 
“And it would label the Federation 
as a militant aggressor, which is 
something we’ve avoided for cen- 
turies. But we have no choice. That 
weapon must work on an electronic 
wave principle, and its range might 
be measured in light years. It could 
wipe out the entire population of a 
planet. It could kill every man in 
an entire fleet before our ships 
could get within striking distance. 
We simply do not dare let the 
Haarvians see that we fear that 
weapon. We know the next Keeper 
of the Bird will be chosen soon. I’m 
giving you just thirty days. If you 



SILENCE IS DEADLY 



15 




can’t supply us with the answers 
we want in that time, we’ll have to 
risk an attack, and hope that sur- 
prise will outweigh the advantage 
of that weapon.” 

“I’ll do my best,” Hilford said. 

“You know about the way our 
agents have been disappearing?” 

“Yes,” Hilford said. “I know 
about that.” 

The admiral nodded, and said 
solenmly, in a tone of voice that 
clearly implied that he never ex- 
pected to see Hilford again, “Good 
luck.” 

Hilford sat watching the waves 
ripple across the harbor, and won- 
dered what had gone wrong. In 
the market place, the Black-Gape 
had taken one glance at him and 
recognized him as an alien. He 
was certain of that. But then — on 
the fishing boat he had been taken 
for a Kammian seaman. Certainly 
changing his hat hadn’t made the 
difference. 

And Zorrel — Zorrel had had two 
years of experience in the rural 
areas of Kamm, and he was a 
bright young agent. And he had 
been snapped up like a novice on 
his first day in 00. 

Looking up suddenly, Hilford 
saw a ship approaching, clumsily 
tacking across the broad bay to- 
wards the quay. He watched it idly, 
thinking to pick up a few seafaring 
points, and then lost interest. When 
he looked again the ship was hover- 
ing fifteen feet from the quay, and 
its captain stood atop the low cabin 
gesturing at him wildly. 

“Look away, you sniveling dirt 
digger! On your lazy feet, you de- 

16 



praved son of a sway-backed ox! 
Look away!” 

Startled, Hilford struggled to his 
feet. A deck hand swung deftly, 
and a thick rope shot at Hilford. 
He ducked out of the way, stum- 
bled, and fell on his back on the 
muddy cobblestones. Momentarily 
stunned, he lay there with the 
heavy rope across his chest. Two 
passing seamen seized the rope and 
hauled lustily. They were joined by 
others, and the ship was slowly 
drawn towards the quay. 

Hilford got to his feet, shook his 
head confusedly, and started un- 
certainly to walk away. The ship’s 
captain whirled about, took a long 
leap from the top of the cabin to 
the quay, seized Hilford’s shoulders, 
and spun him around. He towered 
over Hilford, a huge, brawny, red- 
faced man, and his hands shook 
with anger as he flashed them un- 
der Hilford’s nose. 

“Dirt digger! Sniveling dirt dig- 
ger! When does a seaman refuse to 
look away? Don’t think I won’t re- 
port this. I’ll have you back digging 
before your ship sails.” He gave Hil- 
ford a long, hard look. “I’ve never 
seen you before. You’re too old to 
be an apprentice. Who are you, 
anyway? Let’s see your credentials.” 

Hilford tried to be indignant, 
and managed it badly. “Who do 
you think you are?” 

“Who do I think I am? Why, 
you sniveling dirt digger. I’ll show 
you . .” 

His hands clamped vice-like on 
Hilford’s throat. Seamen were 
gathering around them, and Hil- 
ford’s bleary eyes saw a multitude 
of Black-Capes coming on the run. 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




The hands relaxed suddenly. The 
captain backed away and stood 
with his hands silent, looking al- 
most respectful. A hand gripped 
Hilford’s arm firmly, turned him 
around, and led him along the 
quay. He glanced at the man be- 
side him, expecting to see the omi- 
nous black cape, and saw instead 
a flash of color and the high- 
peaked, green hat of a sea captain. 
Ahead of them, two Black-Capes 
halted, and respectfully kept their 
distance. 

Hilford meekly allowed himself 
to be led to the far end of the quay, 
aboard a large ship, and into the 
cabin. The captain barred the door, 
pointed at a chair, and seated him- 
self across the table. He poured a 
sparkling liquid into two glasses, 
and shoved one at Hilford. 

His hands spoke bluntly. “I am 
Captain Fist. Your name?” 

He was a slim, almost fragile- 
looking man, small for a Kammian, 
but Hilford sensed the hardness his 
slight frame concealed, and re- 
spected him. His bronze face was 
calm and confident, his dark eyes 
alert and penetrating. It W2is, Hil- 
ford thought, an honest face. This 
captain was intelligent, rather than 
cunning. He would outmaneuver a 
man, but he would not deceive him. 
He was obviously someone of im- 
portance, and he had saved Hil- 
ford, there on the quay — but why? 
Hilford raised his glass, to stall for 
time. 

The captain’s fingers moved 
slowly. ‘T understand that your real 
name would have no meaning on 
Kamm. But surely the Federation 
gave you a Kammian name. You 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



are from the Federation, aren’t 
you?” 

Hilford choked, sputtered into 
his glass, and dropp^ it. It shat- 
tered, and the liquor collected in a 
shimmering puddle on the table 
top. Captain Fist nonchalantly pro- 
duced a rag, cleaned up the mess, 
and sat back to look inquiringly at 
Hilford. 

Hilford made his comment a 
weak question. “Federation?” 

The captain smiled. “My last 
trip to 00. That will be sixty days 
ago — sixty-five. The Mother Moon 
was full.” He paused to fill another 
glass for Hilford. “One night I 
found a man on the beach. He 
wore a peddler’s hat, and there 
were five darts in his body. He was 
dead.” 

“Describe him,” Hilford said. 

“He was a small man, middle- 
aged. His hair was reddish, like 
that of many people of the Round 
Province. He looked like a native 
of Kamm. His hands had six fin- 
gers. But when we examined his 
body, seeking to identify him, we 
found his feet had only five toes.” 

Hilford nodded thoughtfully. Six 
fingers, six toes. Naturally. Space 
Intelligence had been careless 
there, which wasn’t normal. But 
then — the Black-Gapes didn’t have 
X-ray vision. It wasn’t his toes that 
had given him away. 

“Was the man your friend?” the 
captain asked. 

Hilford made a quick decision 
that was no decision at all. He had 
to trust this man. “No,” he an- 
swered. “But I knew of him.” 

The captain gestured his under- 
standing. “The following night, the 

17 




Black-Capes were chasing another 
man, outside of 00, along the 
shore. They trapped him on the 
beach, and he was wounded, but 
he ran into the water and swam 
out to sea. I went with two of my 
men in a small boat, and we found 
him — alive. I took 1dm to the home 
of the wife I have in 00, and I 
found that he, too, had six fingers 
on each hand, but only five toes on 
each foot. He trusted me, and from 
him I learned of the Federation.” 

“The Federation,” Hilford said, 
“has been in contact with Kamm 
for nearly two hundred years. 
There has been a trading ship each 
month . .” 

“I learned of the Federation 
from the peddler I plucked from 
the sea. The great dukes do not 
honor the people of Kamm with 
dangerous knowledge. The League 
has long attempted to learn about 
the ships from the sky — without 
success, until I found the peddler.” 

“What happened to the ped- 
dler?” 

“I left him in 00 with my wife. 
He ignored my advice and went to 
the market place. He never re- 
turned.” 

“The Federation has sent many 
such men to the Flat Province in 
the last six months. All have disap- 
peared.” 

“Of course,” the captain said. 

Hilford did not understand his 
matter-of-fact attitude. “They have 
been good men — ^men as accus- 
tomed to live on strange worlds as 
you are accustomed to travel the 
sea. They have been carefully 
trained in the language and ways 
of Kamm. And still they disap- 

18 



peared. Why?” 

“I guessed who you were,” the 
captain said, “because you wore 
the seaman’s hat and did not know 
the ways of seamen. Once you were 
inside this cabin I was certain. If 
you were to walk over to the mar- 
ket place, the first Black-Cape you 
passed would arrest you.” 

“Why?” 

The captain poured another 
drink for himself, and downed it 
quickly. He looked at Hilford in 
amusement, but his hands moved 
almost apologetically. “By your 
smell,” he said. 

Hilford sank back, and struggled 
to control his amazement. Kamm, 
the silent planet. Kamm, where the 
natives had lost their hearing, and 
gained in its place super-sensitive 
senses of sight and smell. Some of 
the manifestations were obvious — 
the astonishing use of color, this 
captain thinking nothing of put- 
ting to sea in the dark to look for 
a solitary swimmer, even — if he 
hadn’t been such a dunce as to 
overlook it — the incredible number 
of peddlers in the market place who 
dealt in perfumes. 

Suddenly he understood the mir- 
acle of his escape. Not even the 
Kammian nose could cope with 
the odors that blended along the 
quay — fresh and decaying fish, a 
variety of imported foodstuffs, pun- 
gent stacks of drying seaweed. On 
the fishing boat, the Black-Cape’s 
sense of smell had been completely 
frustrated, and he was reduced to 
simply looking for a peddler. 

And the sudden disappearance of 
the other Intelligence Agents — once 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




they invaded the market place of 
00, it would only be a matter of 
time before the Black-Gapes no- 
ticed the distinctive odor of the 
alien. Perhaps it was already fa- 
miliar to them, from the men of 
the trading missions. And once they 
understood, they needed only to 
stroll about, sniffing deeply. The 
agents, with their clumsy olfactory 
equipment, could have no inkling 
of how they were betraying them- 
selves. No wonder Space Intelli- 
gence had been losing agents! 

‘T know,” the captain signaled, 
“that the Federation wants nothing 
that would not be good for the peo- 
ple of Kamm. I pledge you the full 
support of the League.” 

“The League?” 

“The Seamen’s League, of which 
I am also captain.” 

“I’ll need your assistance,” Hil- 
ford said. 

The clasped hands, right to left 
and left to right, bending their 
wrists until their forearms touched. 

“Now,” the captain said, “I’ll 
take you home. You’ll carry a bas- 
ket of overripe fish, just in case. 
You must not be careless, like the 
peddler I plucked from the sea.” 

HE CAPTAIN did not live in 
00 proper, but in a small sea- 
men’s village a short distance to the 
east of the metropolis, along the 
shore. Hilford carried a basket of 
fish, which were fully as overripe as 
the captain had promised. The 
captain’s hands spoke busily as 
they walked, and Hilford had to 
strain to follow them in the gather- 
ing darkness. 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



“The League,” the captain said, 
“is independent of any duke. The 
Duke Two Fingers likes us no bet- 
ter than we like him. Years ago, 
when he was first chosen Keeper 
of the Bird, he tried to rule the 
League. The League defied him, 
and he arrested all the seamen who 
were in 00.” He grinned, his white 
teeth flashing disdainfully. “It 
lasted for sixty days. No more 
ships came to the Flat Province. 
The duke placed his Black-Gapes 
on ships of the League, and told 
them to be seamen. Most of them 
were lost in the first storm. In the 
end, the duke paid the League for 
the ships and for the affront to the 
seamen. Since then he has not mo- 
lested the League, and though we 
do not bow down to him, we avoid 
giving him cause for anger.” 

Hilford nodded. 

“You must not move your head,” 
the captain said, looking at him 
sharply. “You move your hand — 
so. 

Hilford repeated the gesture, and 
the captain grinned approvingly. 
“We will make a good Kammian 
of you. The Duke Two Fingers 
himself will not be able to tell you 
from a native of the Flat Province 
— as long as you carry the fish!” 

Hilford did not find it amusing. 
He knew there were times when a 
basket of fish could be a definite 
handicap to a Space Intelligence 
Agent. 

In the captain’s modest but 
brightly-painted house Hilford 
joined the captain and his wife for 
their evening meal. Kammian eti- 
quette wisely prohibited conversa- 
tion when the hands had better 




19 




things to do, and they ate without 
exchanging a word. As soon as they 
had finished, the wife cleared the 
table and discreetly vanished. The 
captain sat staring at the table, ab- 
sently chewing on a piece of sea- 
weed. Hilford was suddenly seized 
by weariness. He had been under 
constant activity and nervous strain 
for eighteen hours. He shook his 
head resolutely, and straightened 
up. He’d had a blazing piece of 
good fortune, but he had actually 
accomplished nothing. 

The captain looked up quickly, 
and echo^ his thought. “There is 
much to be done. Some officers of 
the League are coming — those that 
are in port. They will be here soon.” 

“Their help will be welcome,” 
Hilford said. 

The captain busied himself with 
the arrangements. He brought in 
chairs until the small room was 
crowded. On the arm of each chair 
he hung an oil lamp and lit it. The 
light was focused through a slot to 
fall across the hands of the person 
occupying the chair — a Kammian 
device to aid night conversation. 

Hilford’s mind began to shape 
plans. The cart was the most im- 
portant thing. He must find the 
cart, and repossess the transmitter. 
He could then let Base know he was 
still operating, and ask for a post- 
ponement of the deadline. With the 
help of the League, he should even- 
tually be successful — if only he 
could have time . 

He awakened suddenly, catching 
himself as his body pitched for- 
ward. The room was full of men, 
all sitting calmly at attention, all 
waiting patiently for him to awake. 



He experienced a momentary con- 
sternation at having fallen asleep. 
He turned apologetically to his 
host, and the captain began his 
introduction as if nothing had hap- 
pened. 

“Our guest is of the men who 
send the ships from the sky. They 
call themselves the Federation. We 
discussed this at our last meeting. 
This man is here to help the peo- 
ple of Kamm. The League will give 
him every assistance within its 
power, and all of us will guard his 
presence here with our lives.” 

All eyes were on Hilford. “There 
was a peddler,” he said slowly, 
“who was taken in the market place 
today by the Black-Capes. He was 
my assistant. I must know what has 
been done with him. I must know 
what has been done with his cart.” 

“We will learn what we can,” the 
captain replied. 

“The cart is important. I must 
have the cart.” 

The captain glanced about the 
room, and his hands formed a 
Kammian name. A young man at 
the rear stood up and extinguished 
his lamp. “I understand,” he sig- 
naled, and turned and went out. 

“I saw a man in the duke’s car- 
riage today,” Hilford said. “He was 
not of this planet.” 

“The man with the holes in his 
head,” the captain said. “Evil meets 
with evil in the duke’s carriage.” 

“Do you know where he comes 
from?” 

The circle of hands remained 
motionless. “Two such men have 
been seen with the duke,” the cap- 
tain said finally. “We know no 
more than that.”

“Six months ago,” Hilford said, 
“men of the Federation called on 
the Duke Two Fingers. Their call 
was a gesture of friendship, which 
is made each year. The next morn- 
ing the men were found in the 
streets of 00, murdered.” 

“It is the duke’s way of doing 
things,” the captain said simply. 

“Anything I could learn of this 
crime would be of value.” 

He followed the captain’s gaze as 
it swept quickly about the room. No 
hand moved. The captain’s fingers 
shaped another name, and a sea- 
man extinguished his lamp and 
went out. Attention returned to 
Hilford. 

“There are matters which I must 
attend to in person,” Hilford said. 
“What can be done to make me 
smell like a Kammian? I cannot 
carry fish everywhere I go.” There 
was no reply. “Would it be fitting 
for me to use a perfume that would 
hide the odor?” 

Smiles flickered on the seamen’s 
faces. “A male does not use per- 
fume,” the captain said bluntly. 
“And yet — there is a perfume mak- 
er in 00. He is a good man. He 
might make you a perfume that 
would cancel your odor, and no 
more. Perhaps tomorrow . 

“Why not tonight?” 

“It would be dangerous for the 
perfume maker. We seamen can 
frequent the drinking places at 
night and wander about undis- 
turbed. That is expected of seamen. 
But the citizens of 00 must be in 
their homes two hours after sun- 
down. It can mean death if the 
Black-Gapes find them on the 
streets.” 



“Then let your perfume maker 
be a seaman,” Hilford said. 

Puzzled faces stared at Hilford, 
and there was the confused move- 
ment of shifting feet and fingered 
protests. “I do not understand,” the 
captain said. “He is a perfume 
maker . .” 

Hilford fumbled in the lining of 
his cape, and donned his scarlet 
peddler’s hat. “Look — I’m a ped- 
dler.” 

The captain’s face wore a star- 
tled expression. “Of course!” He 
dispatched a young seaman, with 
an extra seaman’s hat concealed 
under his cape. 

“When is the next Keeper of the 
Bird to be chosen?” Hilford asked. 

“Only the dukes know.” 

“Where is the choice made?” 

“Somewhere in the mountains, it 
is said. Only the dukes know. And 
perhaps the most trusted Black- 
Capes.” 

“Do all the dukes attend?” 

“Yes. The southern dukes jour- 
ney by sea to 00, and the northern 
dukes journey by sea to the Tri- 
angular Province. Where they meet, 
only the dukes know.” 

Hilford did a quick review of his 
geography. The mountain range 
ran along the center of Kamm’s 
long, narrow continent. So the 
dukes would travel the northern or 
southern seas to the center of the 
continent and journey inland, to 
meet in the mountains. It would 
not be difficult for them to keep 
their meeting place a secret. Kam- 
mian commerce moved by sea. 
Roads were few in the interior, and 
probably few people ever ventured 
to cross the mountains. 



SILENCE IS DEADLY 



21 




Hilford felt encouraged. This 
was more than Space Intelligence 
had learned in the previous two 
centuries. “Here is our objective,” 
he said. “The liberation of the peo- 
ple of Kamm must proceed slowly. 
We wish to avoid violence. The first 
step must be to secure the appoint- 
ment of another duke as Keeper of 
the 

The captain gestured sadly. 
“That is impossible.” 

“We of the Federation often find 
ourselves called upon to do the 
impossible.” 

“That is impossible,” the captain 
said again. “The duke’s younger 
brother is High Priest of the Bird.” 
Hilford’s response was unneces- 
sarily and futilely vocal. “Ah!” he 
exclaimed. So that was the basis for 
the duke’s system in the lottery. 

One seaman leaned forward. It 
was the brawny, red-faced captain 
who had nearly throttled Hilford 
that afternoon. “I sail tomorrow 
for the Round Province,” he said. 
“When I return, I bring the Duke 
One Thumb to 00.” 

“He comes to take part in the 
choice of a new Keeper of the 
Birdr 

“The Duke One Thumb does not 
visit the Flat Province out of love 
for its duke.” 

“Is the Duke One Thumb a 
friend of the League?” 

“Not openly. But seamen feel 
welcome in the Round Province.” 
“Would it be possible for me to 
talk with the Duke One Thumb?” 
“It might be arranged.” 

The door swung open, and the 
perfume maker entered — a tall, 
gangling man who looked ludicrous 



in a seaman’s hat much too large 
for him. He carried a heavy box, 
and the situation had evidently 
been explained to him. He looked 
about the room, sniffed, made his 
way directly to Hilford, sniffed 
again, and grimaced distastefully. 
His long face had an almost com- 
ically mournful expression. 

He set down the box, and his 
delicate fingers moved concisely, 
gracefully. He would have, Hil- 
ford thought, a beautiful Kammian 
accent. “It may be difficult,” he 
said, “but I shall work at it.” 
“Work in the next room,” the 
captain said. 

The door swung open and a 
seaman charged in, fingers moving 
frantically. “Black-Capes coming!” 
The captain pushed Hilford’s 
chair aside, knelt with a knife in 
his hand, and pried up a small 
square of flooring. He signaled to 
Hilford. “Quickly!” 

Hilford lowered himself down. 
The space under the floor was 
shallow, and he stood with his head 
and shoulders above the floor of the 
room. “The perfume maker?” he 
asked. 

“Quickly!” 

He ducked under, and the trap 
closed over him. The darkness was 
absolute — not so much as a crack 
of light entered around the trap. 
He edged forward until his fingers 
touched damp earth. He found 
himself in a scoop>ed-out area per- 
haps three strides square. In one 
corner there was a box, and he sat 
down. The waiting began. 

On a normal planet he would 
have heard the police making a 
noisy entry, heard their bullying

22 




questions, and had some idea of 
how things were going. On Kamm 
he heard nothing — and when the 
trap opened, he would not know 
if it meant safety or capture. 

But he was a veteran intelligence 
agent, and he did not waste energy 
in worrying about a situation that 
he could not control. He relaxed 
in the darkness, leaned back against 
the damp wall of his hiding place, 
and dozed off. 

Light was falling dimly through 
the opened trap when he awoke, 
and the captain was shaking him. 
They climbed out, closed the trap, 
and took their seats. The seamen 
faced him calmly, as if nothing 
had happened. 

“All that trouble for nothing?” 
Hilford asked. 

Captain Fist looked gloomy. “I 
do not like this. Not for years have 
there been so many Black-Gapes in 
our village. They inquired after the 
seaman I brought home with me.” 
“That means . .” 

“It means a seaman, or a mem- 
ber of his family, is in the pay of 
the Black-Capes. We must proceed 
cautiously. By tomorrow they will 
have compared reports with the 
Black-Capes that were on the quay 
today. They will want to know 
what I did with the seaman who 
behaved so awkwardly.” 

“What did you tell them about 
the seaman you brought home?” 
“I brought no seaman home,” 
the captain said. “I brought the 
perfume maker. Of course in the 
dusk some fool may have mistaken 
the color of his hat.” He smiled 
slyly. “The perfume maker is con- 
ferring with the League about some 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



perfume which he wishes to ex- 
port. He will be my guest until 
morning. And early tomorrow the 
awkward seaman will ship on a 
boat bound for the Round Province. 
He will be seen going aboard by a 
Black-Gape who will recognize him 
— ^we shall see to that. And I have 
already sent out a small boat to 
meet him down the coast and bring 
him back after dark tomorrow. We 
should hear no more of the mat- 
ter.” 

“It is well arranged,” Hilford 
said. 

The perfume maker came in 
from the next room, and dabbed 
Hilford in unlikely places with a 
pungent, colorless liquid. The as- 
sembled seamen sniffed carefully, 
and Captain Fist delivered the 
verdict. 

“No,” he said. “You have 
blended one evil scent with another. 
It hides nothing.” He turned quick- 
ly to Hilford. “Apologies, but . .” 

“Quite all right,” Hilford said. 

The perfume maker turned away 
sadly. “It is difficult,” his graceful 
fingers signaled. “But I shall work 
at it.” 

Hilford briefed the seamen care- 
fully on the Federation point-of- 
view, and found them vaguely dis- 
appointed. They had expected, per- 
haps, armed assistance against the 
Duke Two Fingers, and they had to 
resign themselves to a more subtle 
kind of revolution. Four times the 
perfume maker tiptoed in to test a 
new concoction, and registered four 
more failures. The meeting lasted 
until dawn, and Hilford was given 
a hearty breakfast and sent on his 
way. 

23 




He walked to the quay closely 
surrounded by a dozen seamen. 
Several carried baskets that were 
awesomely tainted with the odor 
of the previous day’s fish. The 
brawny captain left Hilford stand- 
ing on board his ship in full view 
of the passers-by, and walked away. 
He returned a few minutes later, in 
jocular conversation with a Black- 
Cape. The Black-Cape went his 
way, laughing heartily. 

‘T asked him,” the captain told 
Hilford, “if he remembered the 
spectacle you made of yourself yes- 
terday. He did. I told him that you 
men from the north are all igno- 
ramuses, but by the time I got you 
back from the Round Province 
you’d either be dead, or a seaman. 
It won’t surprise me if you jump 
ship before the return trip.” He 
landed a hearty slap on Hilford’s 
back and nearly sent him over the 
railing. 

Well down the coast and out of 
sight of land, Hilford transferred to 
a small fishing boat. The boat re- 
turned after dark, and landed him 
near the seamen’s village. Captain 
Fist met him on the beach, and led 
him to a nearby shack. 

“The Black-Capes have been to 
the village twice today,” he said. “I 
don’t like it. I’m afraid this place is 
not safe for you. I’ve arranged for 
you to stay in 00.” 

“I place full trust in your judg- 
ment,” Hilford said. 

“The second time they came 
they discovered the trap in the floor. 
Nothing there, of course, but it 
definitely means that I have a 
traitor in the League. I went pCT- 
sonally to complain to the Captain 



of the Black-Capes. He gave me 
profound apologies. These are un- 
settled times, he said, and the police 
take no action that is not neces- 
sary. I told him that if the seamen 
are molested further I’ll move 
League Headquarters to another 
province and keep the seamen out 
of 00 until the times are less unset- 
tled. They’re suspicious about some- 
thing, and they don’t know quite 
what it is.” 

“Did you learn anything about 
my friend, the peddler?” 

“Nothing. We continue to try. 
But I’m afraid you will not see him 
again. He has probably been taken 
away.” 

“Away? Where?” 

“To the mountains. No prisoners 
return from the mountains.” 

“What happens to them?” 

“The Duke Two Fingers is reviv- 
ing the old ways. No one knows for 
certain, but we guess. In the past, a 
bloodthirsty duke used animals. 
The Duke Two Fingers uses men.” 
Hilford was staggered. Human 
sacrifice? 

Captain Fist’s eyes blazed. “I 
have revered the Holy Bird all my 
life, as a man of Kamm should. But 
holiness that demands the life of a 
man is not holiness. It is evil. Now 
— ^we go to 00.” 



H ilford was installed in an 
inn, next door to his friend the 
perfume maker. His quarters were 
a secret room on the third — and 
top — floor. Its dimensions were 
seven feet by five feet, and he re- 
measured it a dozen times the first 
day. He entered, a panel closed be-

hind him, and he was both hidden 
and trapped. 

Captain Fist dutifully visited him 
once each day, and twice he 
brought news. A witness had seen 
the duke’s Black-Capes dumping 
the bodies of the murdered trade 
commissioners from carts in the 
dingy alley where they were found 
the next morning. A group of pris- 
oners had been seen leaving for the 
mountains. Zorrel was probably 
among them — if he was not already 
dead. 

The days passed. Once the 
Black-Capes raided the inn. They 
found nothing, but Hilford’s un- 
easiness was heightened, and the 
captain did not disguise his worry 
about the traitor in his organiza- 
tion. 

“It is not one of my officers,” he 
said. “He suspects that I meet you 
here at the inn, but he does not 
know of the secret room. When I 
find him I shall feed him to the 
fish.” 

The perfume maker regularly 
sent over new mixtures for Hilford 
to try. And each time a seaman 
would take one studious sniff and 
inform Hilford that he still smelled 
obnoxious. 

The days passed, and on the fifth 
day in the inn Hilford decided that 
he could wait no longer. He brought 
up the subject of Zorrel’s cart. The 
captain had discovered nothing. 
There was no indication that the 
duke’s agents had disposed of it, 
so it was assumed that the duke 
had converted it to his own use. 

“I must find that cart,” Hilford 
said. “It will take me two minutes 
to remove the hidden equipment, 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



and I must have it.” 

That evening there was a crowd- 
ed meeting in Hilford’s secret 
chamber, and an expedition was 
organized. The duke’s carts and 
wagons were parked in a meadow 
near his walled estate. There were 
two sentries who circled the area, 
keeping its perimeter constantly in 
view. The sentries were more a 
matter of form than necessity. No 
resident of 00 would steal from 
the Duke Two Fingers. 

“I will deal wiffi the sentries,” 
Hilford said. “I need only to get 
within fifteen paces of them.” 

“No Black-Cape sentry would 
allow a seaman to get that close,” 
the captain said. “You’d have three 
darts in you before you got within 
twenty paces.” 

“I won’t be a seaman,” Hilford 
said, a bit jauntily. “I’ll be another 
Black-Gape.” 

The seamen gazed at him in 
open-mouthed admiration. Clearly, 
these men from the Federation 
were brilliant fellows. 

Hilford felt that the captain’s 
plans were overly elaborate, but 
his protests were silenced. The ex- 
pedition set out the following night, 
as soon as it was dark, wearing black 
capes and hats borrowed from the 
duke’s official tailor. Other seamen 
were stationed at intervals from 
the wood near the duke’s estate to 
the market place on the other side 
of 00. And in the market place sea- 
men were ready to start a roaring 
fire if a diversion was necessary. A 
fire in 00 was a serious matter, and 
would take priority over any cart 
theft. 



25 




Hilford moved out of the 
shadows of the wood and strode 
towards the sentry, giving him the 
stiff-armed Black-Cape salute. At 
ten paces he triggered a focused 
beam from his stun-gun, and the 
sentry folded up into a paralyzed 
heap. He was dragged into the 
shadows, and a black-caped seaman 
took his place. The other sentry was 
quickly dealt with. Black-caped sea- 
men stationed themselves at inter- 
vals among the carts, and one 
accompanied Hilford — not to assist 
him, but to keep watch and let 
him know if trouble came. There 
were no shouts of warning on 
Kamm. 

Hilford turned his attention to 
the carts, and was startled by the 
number of them — dozens, lined up 
in precise rows. Did the Duke Two 
Fingers have some passion for col- 
lecting ox carts? But no — these 
would be intended as military trans- 
port. The duke was planning the 
conquest of Kamm! 

He moved quickly from cart to 
cart. Some he could dismiss with 
a glance, but many were the same 
type as Zorrel’s cart, and he had to 
probe the interior for the concealed 
panel that hid the transmitter. 

He moved as quickly as possible, 
and his escort lurked behind him 
and signaled, “Haste!” every time 
Hilford looked at him. They 
reached the end of the first long 
row and started on the second, and 
suddenly the escort gripped Hil- 
ford’s arm. They ran together, 
dodging among the carts, and in 
the soft light of Kamm’s three 
moons Hilford saw waves of Black- 
Capes racing down on them from 

26 



all directions. As he ran, he cursed 
himself for allowing such elaborate 
preparations. Too many seamen 
had known of the raid, and the 
League’s traitor had struck again. 

Hilford wielded his stun-gun at 
medium power, and bowled over 
ranks of Black-Capes. They darted 
through the break in the encircling 
lines, and raced for the woods. In 
the dim light Hilford could not 
tell friend from foe, but evidently 
the seaman could. He directed Hil- 
ford’s attention to shadows leaping 
towards them, and turned him 
away from others. Hilford sprayed 
at long range with his stun-gun. He 
could do no more than momentari- 
ly daze the pursuers, but seconds 
were what they needed. 

The black-caped seamen passed 
them, running for the woods, and 
Hilford held his ground to fight a 
delaying action. “Two missing,” 
his escort signaled. “Can’t wait.” 
Darts were flashing past them. Hil- 
ford pointed the stun-gun as he 
ran, and sprayed again at long 
range. A dart stabbed into his arm, 
and he scarcely felt it. In the direc- 
tion of 00 flames were leaping high 
into the air, and the pursuing 
Black-Capes seemed not to notice 
them. Hilford wondered if the 
diversion was coming too late. 

They had just reached the edge 
of the trees when a dart struck 
Hilford squarely in the back. He 
stumbled, crashed headlong into a 
tree, and lost consciousness. 

He came to, and opened his eyes 
to see a Black-Cape bending over 
him. He closed his eyes quickly, 
and weakly raised his hand to his 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




throat. They had not taken the Holy 
Bird. He still had his stun-gun, 
which meant he had a chance to 
escape. But he felt horribly weak. 
He would need strength. 

He opened his eyes again, and 
saw the Black-Gape grinning at 
him. It was his seaman escort. He 
lay on the narrow cot in his 
cramped secret room. 

“We carried you,” the seaman 
signaled. “The Black-Capes left us 
for the fire.” 

Hilford’s fingers moved feebly. 
“Your captain is a wise man.” 

“The captain has been arrested,” 
the seaman said. “So have the 
other officers — all the Black-Gapes 
could find. You’ve been unconscious 
for six hours.” 

“What happens now?” 

“We have given the duke one 
day to release the seamen. If he 
does not, we will leave 00, and no 
more ships will come to the Flat 
Province.” 

“The duke will not care, now,” 
Hilford said. “He has traitors 
among the seamen, and they will 
train men to sail the duke’s ships. 
The duke will need his own ships 
to conquer Kamm, because he 
knows the men of the League would 
not help him.” 

“Men do not lesu'n in a day to 
sail the seas of Kamm.” 

“The duke has plenty of time. 
Or he thinks he has, if he is chosen 
again to be the Keeper of the 
Bird/’ 

The seaman looked worried. Hil- 
ford was frantic with worry. It 
would be morning, now, and he had 
just twenty- two days before the 
Federation would strike. He did not 



dare tell that to the seamen. If a 
traitor took word of the attack to 
the duke, the Haarns would know, 
and what was planned as a quick 
conquest would turn into bloody, 
all-out war. 

He gave way to his weakness, 
and slept. 

When he awoke Captain Fist 
was there, with a doctor. There was 
grim sympathy in the captain’s 
face. “It grieved me to hear of 
your wounds,” he said. “It was 
noble of you to sacrifice yourself 
for my seamen, but you are the 
important one. You should have 
saved yourself.” 

“It grieved me to hear of your 
imprisonment,” Hilford said. “Es- 
pecially so since I was responsible.” 

“You were not responsible. The 
duke has never loved the League, 
and he is quick to blame us for 
any of his troubles.” 

“Have you found your traitor?” 

The captain’s fingers formed 
words that were strange to Hilford 
— rousing, seaman profanity. “I 
shall find him. And he will be lost 
at sea on his next voyage.” 

“Perhaps there is more than 
one,” Hilford suggested. 

“It is possible. The Duke Two 
Fingers has a large purse. But the 
duke is not yet ready to fight the 
League. Later, perhaps, but not 
now.” 

“We risked much for no gain,” 
Hilford said. “I heard that two 
men were lost.” 

“They were captured. They were 
wearing black capes, so there was 
nothing to identify them as sea- 
men. But they were also released. 
That I do not understand.” 



SILENCE IS DEADLY 



27 




“The duke is crafty. He would 
like to know what we were seeking 
among his carts. He hopes to find 
out, so he turned everyone loose, 
expecting us to try again. But we 
won’t try again. It would be use- 
less.” 

“You are not strong, now,” the 
captain said. “You have lost blood, 
and you need rest. When you have 
recovered, we will make new plans.” 

“Yes,” Hilford said. “When I 
have recovered.” He saw his dead- 
line marching relentlessly towards 
him, one day at each stride. Now 
there were twenty-one. 

Hilford spent three days in the 
grip of a blazing fever, while the 
worried Kammian doctor minis- 
tered to him clumsily. The captain 
made his daily visits. The perfume 
maker came with new mixtures, 
and Hilford indifferently sub- 
mitted to his dabbings. More fail- 
ures. He slept and woke, and some- 
times someone was there — the 
captain, or the perfume maker, or 
the doctor, or another seaman. 
Sometimes he was alone. It did not 
seem to matter. 

On the fourth day he awoke and 
found a stranger in the room — 
a short, rotund man whose flaming 
red hair was offset by the black 
of his flowing robes. He was watch- 
ing Hilford curiously. “I am the 
Duke One Thumb,” he said. Hil- 
ford stirred weakly, and struggled 
to sit up. “No,” the duke’s chubby 
fingers told him. “You need rest. 
I have a great admiration for a 
man who braves the imjjossible.” 

“Nothing is impossible,” Hilford 
said. 

28 



The duke bowed respectfully. 
“The captain has informed me of 
your wish to see me. How may I 
serve you?” 

“I would like to make you the 
next Keeper of the Bird,” Hilford 
said, and knew immediately that 
it sounded ridiculous, coming from 
a sick man, from a helpless fugitive. 

The duke answered matter-of- 
factly, “Impossible.” 

“Do not all dukes have an equal 
chance?” 

The duke hesitated. “Yes. All 
dukes have an equal chance. The 
Duke Two Fingers and his brother, 
who is the High Priest of the Bird, 
have made certain changes in the 
way the choice is made, but the 
changes are not new. The same 
procedures were in use at the time 
of my grandfather’s grandfather. 
So all dukes should have an equal 
chance, but the Duke Two Fingers 
will be chosen.” 

“How is the choice made?” 

“I cannot tell you. Only the 
dukes and the Priests of the Bird 
are privileged to know.” 

“Do you approve of the giving 
of lives of men to the Bird?” 

The duke paled. “You know 
that? But . .” He was thought- 
ful. “I know there have been 
rumors. No, I do not approve. It is 
a terrible thing. A sickening thing. 
But I cannot change it.” 

“You would do things differently 
if you were Keeper of the Bird?” 
“There are many things I would 
do differently.” 

“You won’t tell me how the 
choice is made? For Kamm?” 

“I have sworn my oath. I cannot 
tell.” 



LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




“Did you know that the Duke 
Two Fingers plans to rule all of 
Kamm?” 

“I have guessed.” 

“But you still cannot tell me 
how the choice is made?” 

The duke said nothing, but he 
met Hilford’s gaze firmly. He was 
not, Hilford thought, the irresolute 
weakling he had expected. He 
would be a good man. Firm, but 
honest. The Federation could deal 
with such a man. 

“You know that I am of the 
Federation?” he asked. 

“Yes. The Federation has al- 
ways been just in its dealings with 
Kamm.” 

“You know that the Duke Two 
Fingers has guests from the sky 
who are not of the Federation?” 
He grimaced, and answered dis- 
gustedly, “Yes. They are evil men. 
Fit companions for the Duke Two 
Fingers.” 

“Have they given the duke 
weapons?” 

“No. They have refused to give 
the duke weapons.” He smiled at 
Hilford’s surprise. “I have my own 
sources of information,” he said. 

“Did you know that the men of 
the Federation’s trade commission 
were murdered by some strange 
and powerful weapon?” 

“I heard of the deaths, I do not 
understand them, but I do not 
think the Duke Two Fingers has 
such a weapon.” 

“Perhaps his evil guests used it.” 
“That is possible. Yes, it must 
have happened that way.” 

Hilford felt that he had reached 
an impasse. The duke was the one 
man he was likely to meet who 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



could tell him everything he needed 
to know. And the duke had sworn 
an oath, and he was a man who 
would honor his oath. 

“The chosen duke is called 
Keeper of the Bird” Hilford said 
suddenly. “Why?” 

The duke looked at him curious- 
ly. “Because he is the Keeper of 
the Bird,” 

“A real Bird? A live Bird?” 
“Of course.” 

‘T did not know such Birds 
actually existed.” 

“Many of them exist. One is 
chosen at the same time that the 
duke is chosen, and entrusted to 
his care for the term of his office.” 
“Entrusted to his care,” Hilford 
mused. “He is responsible for it, 
then. Supposing the duke is negli- 
gent?” 

The Duke One Thumb smiled. 
“He will not be negligent. It is 
always a young and healthy Bird, 
and the Keeper of the Bird lavishes 
tender care upon it. He would 
guard it with his life. If it were to 
die, he would lose his office im- 
mediately, and he could never hold 
the office again.” 

“I understand. And the Keeper 
of the Bird rules all the Black- 
Gapes on Kamm.” 

“Yes. But he can send them into 
another province only when a duke 
requests them. And the other dukes 
can have no armed men outside 
of their personal guard, unless they 
request them of the Keeper of the 
Bird, My personal guard is large, 
and there are few Black-Gapes in 
the Round Province.” 

A neat arrangement for an am- 
bitious Keeper of the Bird, Hilford 

29 




thought. By controlling the Black- 
Capes, he alone, of all the dukes, 
could raise a standing army. When 
his army was large enough, he could 
take over all of Kamm. 

But he would have to have a 
powerful army, because the other 
eleven dukes would unite against 
him if he attacked one. With 
Kamm’s scanty resources it would 
take time to plan a full-scale con- 
quest. It would take more than 
a five-year term as Keeper of the 
Bird. 

A lottery which shifted the power 
from duke to duke at regular in- 
tervals had been a sound system. 
But once a duke rigged the lottery 
and got himself chosen for several 
consecutive terms, the entire bal- 
ance of power on the planet was up- 
set. The Duke Two Fingers was 
finishing his third term. A fourth 
would enable him to conquer 
Kamm. 

“When is the next Keeper of 
the Bird to be chosen?” Hilford 
asked. 

“I cannot tell you that.” 

“It must be soon, or you would 
not be here.” 

“That much you know. I cannot 
tell you more.” 

Hilford struggled weakly, and 
pushed himself into a sitting posi- 
tion. “I will be present when the 
choice is made. I will make you the 
next Keeper of the Bird.^^ 

The duke clasped Hilford’s 
hands, and bent forward until 
their forearms touched. “You are 
a brave man. Unfortunately, it is 
impossible. It would mean your 
death, and it would be a terrible 
death.” He slid open the panel, 

30 



and turned again before he stepped 
through. “Your life would be given 
to the Birds.” 



HE PERFUME maker had 
been respectfully waiting for 
the duke to leave. He stepped 
through the panel, solemn as usual, 
and l^ded Hilford a small bottle. 
“Mixture number thirty-one,” he 
said sadly. 

“Fm afraid your task is even 
more impossible than mine,” Hil- 
ford said. 

“I shall succeed. I have had 
worse tasks. The Duke Two Fingers 
himself once gave me a worse task, 
and I accomplished it.” 

“What need did the duke have 
for perfume?” 

“He wanted a scent that the 
Birds would not like.” 

“The Holy Birds?” Hilford 
straightened up attentively. 

“Yes. They are most repulsive 
creatures. I worked for weeks. I 
would drench a rodent with scent 
and put him in their cage, and 
they would eat him. My two 
hundred and sixty-third mixture 
was a success. The rodent was per- 
fectly safe with them — ^until the 
scent wore off. Then they tore 
him to pieces. It was not pleasant, 
seeing those Birds every day. I did 
not sleep well for weeks after- 
wards.” 

“You saw them at the duke’s 
palace?” 

“Yes.” 

“I thought the Keeper of the 
Bird kept only one bird.” 

“These were brought by the 
duke’s brother, who is a Priest of 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 





the Bird. I think the priests wanted 
something to protect themselves 
from the Birds, and I do not blame 
them. Anyway, that was years ago 
— long before the Duke Two 
Fingers became Keeper of the 
Bird. Perhaps he uses it himself, 
now, with a Bird in his palace. I 
mixed him a new batch only a 
month ago.” 

“You are the first person I’ve 
met, outside of the Duke One 
Thumb, who has ever seen a live 
Bird.” 

“The Duke Two Fingers pledged 
me to secrecy. You are the first I 
have ever told.” 

“I shall respect your confidence,” 
Hilford said. “And I shall give 
your mixture thirty-one the usual 
critical test.” 

The perfume maker smiled wist- 
fully. “I shall commence mixture 
thii^-two, just in case.” 

Captain Fist came in the eve- 
ning, and sat for a long time with 
his fingers silent, looking weary 
and troubled. “I must leave you,” 
he said finally. “I have rarely 
stayed in 00 for so long, and the 
Black-Capes are suspicious. Now 
they follow me everywhere. So I 
must make a short voyage. I’ll be 
back in ten days, and less if the 
winds favor me. You will be well 
looked after — I promise that.” 

“Thank you,” Hilford said. He 
had never felt more helpless. He 
was too weak to leave his hiding 
place, and if he did the first Black- 
Cape that happened along would 
arrest him. And he could no longer 
fully trust the League. 

“I will see you as soon as I 
return,” the captain said. He arose 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



to go, stepped towards the panel, 
and suddenly whirled about and 
stared incredulously. Twice he 
raised his hands to speak, and 
dropped them. 

“What’s the matter?” Hilford 
asked anxiously. 

“I just noticed. I no longer 
smell you!” 

“Mixture thirty-one,” Hilford 
said gleefully. “Tell the perfume 
maker to send up a large bottle.” 

After the captain had gone, he 
made his plans. He would have to 
get out of 00. Whatever else he 
might learn in the capital city of 
the Duke Two Fingers, he could 
not finish his assignment there. 
And if he stayed longer, the 
League’s traitor might learn of his 
hiding place. 

He left only a note of thanks for 
the seamen, and carrying the large 
bottle of scent that the jubilant per- 
fume maker had delivered, he 
slipped out of the inn into the dark 
streets of 00. 

He wore his seaman’s hat until 
he was clear of the town. Once a 
Black-Cape stopped him, and as 
Hilford gripped his stun-gun the 
policeman noticed his hat and 
passed him by with a nod. Outside 
of 00 Hilford changed to the 
peddler’s hat, and struck out along 
the grassy ruts of the cart path that 
led northwards towards the moun- 
tains. 

He tired quickly, but he dogged- 
ly kept a firm pace and pushed 
himself onwards. The sun rose, 
and slowly added its brisk warmth 
to his feverish discomfort. Soon 
each staggering stride became a 

31 




matter of forced concentration. 

He pushed his weakened body 
forward until mid-moming, and 
he collapsed in a scant patch of 
shade on a hilltop, with the build- 
ings of 00 still visible on the south- 
ern horizon. He could go no 
farther. 

To the north, he saw a small 
village of scattered, colorful houses, 
a peddler with ox and cart plodding 
up the hill towards him — and, in 
the hazy distance, the beckoning, 
snow-covered mountains. He strug- 
gled to his feet, and stopped the 
peddler. In five minutes of oblique 
negotiations he purchased ox, cart 
and merchandise at a price that 
roughly equaled their sound value 
times ten. In the village he dis- 
posed of half the merchandise to 
a wily old shopkeeper at a ruinous 
loss, and stocked up on food. Once 
clear of the village, he climbed 
into the half-empty cart and fash- 
ioned a cramped resting place for 
himself. 

A swat across its hindquarters 
started the ox. It lurched dumbly 
forward along the path it had 
followed less than an hour before, 
having no apparent interest either 
in where it was going or where it 
had been. Hilford watched anxious- 
ly to see if it would follow the path 
'without supervision. When it did, 
he lay down and fought the agony 
that stabbed his wounds as the cart 
rocked and bumped over the ruts. 
Finally his exhaustion triumphed, 
and he slept. 

It was dark when he awoke. The 
northward track lay ahead of him 
in the dim moonlight, and the ox 
was plodding along indifferently. 



He got out and staggered beside it 
for a time, attempting to exercise 
his cramped muscles, but the effort 
proved too much for him. He led 
the ox off the main track and into 
the shelter of some trees to rest. 

He did not know when the dukes 
would leave 00, or how fast they 
could travel. His only hope lay in 
reaching the mountains ahead of 
them. If he could do that, he might 
have a chance. 

And the attack would come in 
sixteen days. 

The following day he suffered a 
relapse. He lay in his cart, burning 
with fever, while the ox moved 
patiently onwards. Day blurred in- 
to night and became day again, 
and he lost track of time. Perhaps 
the ox rested when it grew tired, 
or perhaps not. Perhaps his cart 
met travelers along the way, or 
perhaps not. He did not know. 

He was able, finally, to get out of 
the cart and walk beside the ox. 
He knew that five days had passed, 
and perhaps it was six or seven. 
He walked, and rested, and his 
strength began to return to him. 
The next morning, from the side 
of a mountain slope, he looked 
down on the scraggly forested, roll- 
ing plain, and saw a long, bright- 
ly colored caravan creeping towards 
him — animals, carts, attendants and 
the royal personages of the six 
southern dukes. He moved on, and 
his ox panted and strained as it 
hauled the cart up a steep moun- 
tain pass. 

Kamm’s belt of conical moun- 
tains appeared to be of volcanic 
origin, and the peaks on the south- 
ern fringe were arranged confusedly 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR.

— now humped closely upon one 
another, now widely spaced. The 
rough cart path went its winding 
way among the lofty trees, passing 
between two mountains with scarce- 
ly a ripple in elevation, then point- 
ing its way steeply upwards a 
thousand feet for the next pass. 

Hilford pushed forward, dis- 
daining food and sleep, until ex- 
haustion had overcome him again, 
and the skin of the toiling, perspir- 
ing ox hung in flabby folds. On 
the morning of his third day in 
the mountains he came upon a 
broad, wooded valley. He lashed 
the ox furiously, forcing it into a 
stumbling run. He must cross the 
valley before the dukes’ party came 
out of the pass. He must not be 
seen. 

By noon he had crossed the 
valley and gained the refuge of the 
tree-covered slope on the opposite 
side. He rested, and the ox collapsed 
in its harness. He could safely go 
no farther, he thought. Now he 
must wait until the dukes had 
passed him, and follow them. 

The long caravan descended into 
the valley in mid-afternoon, crossed 
it, and set up camp on the north 
side. As darkness came on, Hilford 
looked down on the bright fires 
with satisfaction. Everything had 
gone according to plan. In the 
morning, he would let them pass 
him, and then follow. But he must 
not oversleep. 

He awoke with the first light of 
dawn in his face, and hurried to 
look down on the sprawling camp. 
There was little sign of activity. 
He returned to his cart, ate, and 
relaxed while the ox grazed con- 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



tentedly on the forest bushes. At 
noon, cooking fires dotted the camp. 
The attendants finished their meal, 
and retired to their tents. Oxen 
were tethered out to pasture. Carts 
were parked neatly around the 
perimeter of the camp. The dukes 
were evidently in no hurry. 

Puzzled, Hilford turned away 
and walked to the top of the pass. 
He looked down into the valley 
to the north, and to his amazement 
he saw another camp site — the 
oxen, the carts, the colorful tents. 

Understanding came suddenly, 
and crushed him. This was the 
camp of the northern dukes. Only 
the dukes could enter the Temple 
of the Bird, and they had left 
their retinues and gone on alone, 
and he had lost them. His exhaust- 
ing journey had been wasted. 

But he still had a few days— five, 
perhaps — and the dukes would not 
undertake a long journey by them- 
selves. The Temple of the Bird 
should be within a day’s walk of 
the camps. There should be some 
kind of path or road leading to it. 
The Temple would need supplies. 

A movement through the trees 
to his left startled him. He leaped 
to his feet, gripping his stun-gun, 
and saw that his ox had pulled loose 
and was wandering about seeking 
choice leaves to munch. With a 
grin, he turned and hurried away 
through the trees. He was a peddler, 
seeking his strayed ox. 

He found the path just as dark- 
ness was falling, a meandering 
foot path that led up out of the 
valley. He quickly lost it in the 
darkness, but he knew its general 

33 




direction, which was up, and he 
kept moving. An hour later he saw 
a flash of light on the mountain 
slope, far above him. 

But he found nothing — no im- 
posing Temple with brightly- 
painted facade, no buildings, no 
signs that humans had passed that 
way. He wandered on in the dark- 
ness, feeling the deep chill of the 
mountain air, feeling the weakness 
that he had been unable to shake 
off in his relentless struggle to 
reach the mountains. 

A cloud choked ofT the last feeble 
glimmer of the smallest Kammian 
moon. He slowed his pace, and 
peered uncertainly ahead of him. 
Suddenly his foot found emptiness, 
and he struggled for balance, lost 
it, and tumbled downwards. 

He landed on a metal framework 
ten feet below the surface, and 
found himself in a caged airshaft, 
about six feet in diameter. Before 
he could collect his confused senses 
pain stabbed at his arm, and he 
jerked away and stood in the center 
of the cage while the giant, hideous- 
ly colored Holy Birds of Kamm 
fluttered greedily about him. One 
swooped up from below and 
slashed at his ankle. The bars 
formed a perfect ladder, and he 
made a rush to climb out and 
was forced back by tearing talons 
and ripping beaks. He experienced 
a wave of dizziness, with a throb- 
bing, pounding sensation in his 
head. While he stood there in be- 
wilderment, he saw in the dim 
light far below a black-hooded 
Priest of the Bird staring up at him. 
The priest whirled suddenly, and 
ran. 



I T WAS A small, barren room 
hewn out of rock. Three black- 
hooded priests filed in, paused to 
sniff Hilford carefully, and took 
their seats. He sniffed them in turn, 
and caught a powerful, pungent 
odor that seemed at the same time 
agreeable and repulsive. He found 
an element of humor in the situa- 
tion. He might have said, “We 
have something in common, gentle- 
men. We patronize the same per- 
fume maker.” But the grim-looking 
priests would not have appreciated 
the joke. 

He stood before them, tottering 
weakly, blood flowing from his 
arm and ankle, and told his story. 
The elder priest leaned forward as 
he finished, and Hilford found the 
haughty nose and cruel features 
vaguely familiar. This would be 
the younger brother of the Duke 
Two Fingers. 

He moved his fingers languidly, 
bored to have such a trifle brought 
to his attention. “A stray ox was 
found this evening,” he said. “Your 
story may be true. If so, that is 
unfortunate. You have had the 
high honor of seeing the Holy Birds 
of Kamm. You have entered the 
forbidden Temple. Your life is 
forfeited to the Birds.” 

The two younger priests led Hil- 
ford away. They passed through a 
labyrinth of corridors, straight, 
curving, ascending, descending, 
branching off. They passed through 
a barred door, and another, and 
Hilford was shoved forward into 
a long room that was nothing more 
than a wide, barren corridor. Bars 
closed silently behind him. 

At the far end were more bars. 



34 



LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




and half a hundred men of Kamm 
stood about, or squatted, or 
stretched out on the damp rock 
floor. Sobs shook one man’s huge 
frame— the only evidence of his 
silent weeping. Hilford’s searching 
gaze photographed the faces, and 
suddenly found one that was fa- 
miliar. Zorrel! 

The young agent walked towards 
him, grinning happily. They stood 
close together, so their fingers could 
have some privacy. “Now there are 
five of us,” Zorrel said. 

“Three other agents here?” 

“Such as they are. Their morale 
isn’t exactly good. They’ve been 
treated badly, and they’ve had the 
misfortune to see what happened 
to some other agents.” He stopped 
suddenly, and fingered Hilford’s 
blood-soaked sleeve. 

“My introduction to the Birds,” 
Hilford told him. 

“Then I don’t need to explain.” 

“About the birds, no. About this 
layout, yes.” 

“Gome,” Zorrel said. He led Hil- 
ford to the far end of the room, and 
they stood looking out through the 
bars upon an enormous, domed, 
circular arena. At intervals around 
the sides there were pairs of barred 
openings about the size of a large 
door — one at floor level, and one 
directly above it. In the center of 
the arena was a cage — just big 
enough, Hilford thought grimly, to 
hold a man. 

“This is the lottery where the 
Keeper of the Bird is chosen, and 
other important matters are de- 
cided,” Zorrel said. “Each duke has 
his own royal box — the upper 
openings. There are twelve of them. 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



When the great moment comes, 
the arena is filled with birds, and 
the victim is placed in the cage. 
The lower doors are opened, and 
the cage is hoisted up to the dome. 
All the victim has to do is get from 
the center of the arena over to one 
of the lower doors before the birds 
tear him to pieces. The first few 
don’t get very far, but eventually 
the birds have their hunger satis- 
fied, and they lose interest. The 
victims get farther and farther, 
and finally one makes it. And what- 
ever door he escapes through, that 
duke is the next Keeper of the 
Bird. Pleasant little game, isn’t it?” 

Hilford shuddered. He’d had his 
share of experience with barbarism 
and violence and human sacrifice, 
but only with the most primitive 
civilizations. It had seemed natural, 
there. Here it was only gruesome. 

“Generations ago, they stopped 
using humans and changed to ani- 
mals,” Zorrel went on. “But the 
Duke Two Fingers is reviving the 
old customs. It’s a nice thing for 
the victim that finally makes it. He 
receives high honors, and he might 
even marry a daughter of a duke, if 
one is available. For the ones that 
don’t make it, it isn’t so nice.” 

“When is the lottery to take 
place?” 

Zorrel laughed sardonically. “Any 
minute, now. We — ” his gesture 
swept the bare room “ — are the 
victims. Wonder if the Birds think 
old men are tougher eating than 
young men. You might stand a 
better chance than a young, tender 
morsel like me.” 

Hilford stood looking thought- 
fully out at the arena. 

35 




“There’s no escape that way,” 
Zorrel said. “And you know what’s 
at the other end — two barred 
doors, and a couple of squads of 
priestly guards. Once the festivities 
start, they’re going to be more in- 
terested in watching the arena than 
us.” He patted his stun-gun. “That 
would be a good time to take over 
this place.” 

“I’ve picked up a fair amount of 
information myself,” Hilford said. 
“I think I have most of the picture, 
now. The question is, what do we 
do with it?” 

“The question is, how do we get 
out of here?” 

“We’re intelligence agents,” Hil- 
ford said. “We have an assign- 
ment.” 

“All right — I’m with you. Better 
not count too much on the others. 
And I’ll tell you one thing.” He 
patted the stun-gun again. “If they 
put me in that arena, the Birds are 
going to regret it. A full charge 
would kill a Bird.” 

“That wouldn’t solve anything. 
It wouldn’t even get you out alive. 
The priests would tear you apart 
if the Birds didn’t. Your gun’s 
charge won’t last forever, and mine 
is pretty well gone now.” 

“So what do we do?” 

“I want to snoop around, and 
talk to our fellow victims.” 

He moved back up the room, 
passed by one man who was gripj>ed 
in a coma of trembling fear, and 
stopped beside a small, wizened 
oldster who grinned at him cheer- 
fully. 

“Don’t get discouraged,” he said 
to Hilford. “Maybe you’ll be lucky, 
like me.” 



“Lucky in what way?” 

“My number doesn’t come up. 
Been here four years, and — ^here I 
am. They don’t call my number. 
Food is good, quarters aren’t bad, 
and they don’t give you much work 
to do. It isn’t a bad life if you 
don’t mind being herded down 
here on Holy Days and the like.” 
Hilford jerked a thumb at the 
arena. “You enjoy what goes on 
there?” 

“I don’t let it^bother me. Sure 
— I tell myself it might be me, in 
there. But it isn’t, and I’ll die of 
old age before they get to me.” 
“You’ve been here four years,” 
Hilford said. “How many lives have 
you seen given to the Birds?” 
“Don’t know. Couple of hundred, 
maybe. Of course, on Holy Days 
it’s only one. I never saw a Choice. 
They say they use a lot of us for a 
Choice.” 

Hilford walked on. He found the 
three intelligence agents, talked 
with them briefly, and left them. 
They had been badly mistreated. 
Marks on their hands suggested 
torture. They had been starved, 
and they were almost too weak to 
walk. He’d have to get them out, 
of course, if he could. But he 
couldn’t count on them for assist- 
ance. 

Suddenly a familiar odor caught 
his attention, bitter and pungent, 
vaguely irritating, vaguely pleasant. 
He turned towards it and saw a 
lean, bronze young man of unmis- 
takable physical hardness. He 
studied his face carefully. He had 
seen him somewhere — in a crowd, 
perhaps, where the face had been 
only one of many. 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



36 




But only one group of Kammians 
achieved that physical condition. 
He was a seaman. And he was 
generously anointed with the scent 
of the Priests of the Bird. 

“That’s a potent perfume you 
wear,” Hilford said. 

The seaman glanced at him 
sullenly, and said nothing. 

“The League will be pleased to 
know who their traitor is.” 

The seaman started. He smiled 
slowly. “They were bound to get 
you, sooner or later. And the 
League will never learn from you.” 
“Give my regards to the Duke 
Two Fingers,” Hilford said. 

He turned, and walked back to 
Zorrel. Odd, he thought, how sud- 
denly the inexplicable is unraveled. 
He knew who the League’s traitor 
was — or one of the traitors. And 
he knew how the Duke Two Fingers 
rigged the lottery. 

He explained to Zorrel, who 
scoffed, at first, and then displayed 
a refined mastery of Kammian pro- 
fanity. “Then the whole thing is 
a farce,” he said. “They call some 
numbers to put on a good show for 
the other dukes, and then they send 
this fellow in. And the birds won’t 
touch him. And he walks through 
the Duke Two Fingers* door, and 
the show is over.” 

“For another five years.” 

“We can arrange an accident for 
this seaman. At least the lottery 
would be genuine.” 

“Too many witnesses,” Hilford 
said. “And it wouldn’t help the 
situation. All the priests would have 
to do is douse another prisoner with 
scent, and show him where the 
Duke Two Fingers’ door is.” 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



“So what do we do about it?” 

“Nothing. I checked that door, 
and it can only be opened from 
the other side. There’s no way out 
of here. We’ll have to wait until 
they take us somewhere else.” 

“What if they try to feed us to 
the Birds?” 

“Let me know if you figure out 
something.” 

They sat down along the wall, 
and waited. Hilford glanced again 
at the arena. There were caged 
air vents in the ceiling, but the one 
that had trapped him opened into 
a smaller room. Enormous natural 
caves, he decided, altered by gen- 
erations of priests to suit their 
purposes. The religion of Kamm 
would provide fascinating study 
material for some young Federation 
ethnologist — if he were lucky 
enough to survive to collect it. 

A door opened, and the black- 
robed, black-hooded priests 
marched in. The prisoners were 
summarily lined up against the 
wall, and a young priest moved 
down the line painting red num- 
bers on their foreheads. 

“The paint rubs off easily,” he 
said. “Any man found with a bare 
forehead will be given to the Birds 
immediately.” 

Perspiration trickled down many 
foreheads, but Hilford noticed that 
no one brushed it away. 

There was movement in the 
arena. A Bird dove hungrily at 
their barred door, and swooped up- 
wards. Momentary panic followed, 
as pale prisoners milled back 
away from the arena and the 
priests angrily sought to restore 
order. Four priests entered the 

37 




arena, and calmly walked towards 
the cage in the center. The air 
was suddenly filled with enormous, 
flapping wings as the birds de- 
scended voraciously, and then 
veered away. The priests pushed 
the cage towards the door where 
the victims were waiting. The 
Choice was about to be made. 

The High Priest himself strode 
the length of the room with a ret- 
inue of priests trailing behind him. 
He stood for a moment looking 
out at the arena. Apparently satis- 
fied that all was in order, he turned, 
and a metal jar was passed to him. 
He shook it sideways, then upright, 
until a disc dropped out of a slot 
in the bottom. He looked down, 
signaled indifferently, “Thirty- 
seven,” and kicked it away. A young 
priest retrieved it, and number 
thirty-seven, a giant of a man, 
brushed Hilford’s arm as he top- 
pled to the floor in a dead faint. 

Priests stripped off his clothing, 
the door swung back, and he was 
shoved into the cage. The priests 
slowly pushed it to the center of 
the arena, and left it. A signal, 
and the cage jerked upwards. 

Those in the room watched with 
a compulsion born of horror. 
Grouching, number thirty-seven 
bolted for the side of the arena as 
soon as the cage was clear of him. 
The first Bird plummeted down- 
wards, raked his back, and sent 
him sprawling. He rolled onto 
his back, lashing out with arms and 
legs. Somehow he clutched a Bird 
by the wing, and there was a 
momentary stir of alarm among the 
priests. 

But another Bird found his eyes, 
38 



and another his throat. Then the 
struggle was over and the feast 
began. The cage was lowered, and 
the priests, ignored by the Birds 
who fought over thirty-seven’s re- 
mains, returned the cage to the 
doorway. 

The High Priest shook the jar 
again. “Number forty-two.” 

The priests dragged him for- 
ward, and four years of luck ran 
out on the wizened little man who 
thought to die of old age. Fear 
paralyzed his legs, and the priests 
load to support his body while they 
stripped off his clothes. They rudely 
stuffed him into the cage. 

When the cage went up, he 
slumped to a kneeling position, 
covering his face with his hands. 
For a terrible moment the Birds 
took no notice of him. Then one 
circled slowly, and landed on his 
back. Pain goaded him into a 
furious struggle, but he had waited 
too long. He never did regain his 
feet. 

The High Priest raised his jar, 
and the bloody game continued. 
The fifth victim called was the 
bronze young seaman. He strode 
forward manfully, but once in the 
arena he acted the part of a 
terrified victim. He ducked and 
dodged, stumbled and fell, struggled 
to his feet lashing out at the Birds. 
But he remained untouched, and 
he worked his way to one side of 
the arena, and suddenly darted 
through an open door. 

The door swung shut. All the 
lights in the royal boxes save one 
were extinguish^. The Duke Two 
Fingers was chosen Keeper of the 
Bird for another five years.

“The end of a mission,” Zorrel 
said. 

Hilford shrugged. “Or the begin- 
ning of a mission.” 

Tension in the room relaxed im- 
mediately. The High Priest strutted 
out, the prisoners wiped the num- 
bers from their foreheads, and the 
priests organized the group into a 
double column and marched it 
away. Hilford and Zorrel held back, 
and were last in line. 

“Prisoners are kept ten in a 
room,” Zorrel said. “The rooms 
are a long way from the exit — at 
least from where I came in. These 
corridors wind all over the place. 
I’m not sure I could find my way 
out.” 

Hilford glanced around. “We’ll 
have to be careful. Those darts 
they shoot can be painful.” 

The procession moved on 
through the network of corridors. 
They took a last turn, and came to 
a row of barred doors. A priest 
counted off ten prisoners, slammed 
the door on them, and barred it. 

“Look up ahead,” Hilford said. 
“The corridor branches off. Where 
does it go?” 

“I don’t know.” 

Hilford moved to conceal his 
fingers from the priests. “When our 
turn comes, we’ll make a dash for 
it. If we can get around the cor- 
ner, we’ll be safe from the darts, 
and we can knock them off a 
couple at a time as they come after 
us. We might be lucky.” 

“I’ll be right beside you.” 

The fourth group of ten was 
counted off, and there were six 
men left. A priest jerked the next 
door open, and stood blocking the 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



corridor. When Hilford’s turn came, 
he leaped and struck once, and 
shoved the priest’s crumpled body 
aside as he raced for the fork in 
the corridor. He sensed Zorrel’s 
presence close behind him. They 
reached the fork and made the turn 
before the first darts flashed past. 
The startled priests had been slow 
to react. 

They were in a short passageway 
that branched off in three direc- 
tions. An oil lamp overhead cast 
eerie reflections. They whirled and 
stood with stun-guns ready. 

“Full power,” Hilford signaled. 
It wouldn’t do to have the men 
come to in a few minutes and de- 
scribe what had happened. 

The first priests came charging 
around the turn. In a matter of 
seconds a dozen bodies lay on the 
corridor floor. They stripped two 
of the men, dragged their bodies 
into an empty room, and donned 
their black robes and hoods. They 
strolled calmly back the way they 
had come. No one questioned them, 
but it took them all of half an 
hour to find the exit. 

They moved down the mountain 
path in the cold air of early dawn, 
ignoring the priests on sentry duty. 
As soon as they reached the protec- 
tion of the trees, Hilford stopped. 

“Head straight west until you 
find the cart track that leads north 
through the mountains,” he said. 
“Follow the track to the top of the 
pass. My cart is hidden in the trees 
maybe fifty feet to the west. In the 
cart you’ll find a large bottle of 
perfume that smells like nothing 
you’ve ever smelled before. Take a 
quick bath in it, and it’ll make you 

39 




smell like a man of Kamm.” 
Zorrel started. “So that’s it!” 
“That is it. Once you are smell- 
ing properly, get down into the 
camp in the south valley, and 
snoop around among the carts to 
see if the Duke Two Fingers acci- 
dentally used ours for his trip north. 
I don’t think anyone will question 
what a priest does. If you find the 
transmitter, tell Headquarters to 
call the whole thing off. We’ll fill 
them in later.” 

“What are you going to do?” 
“Finish our assignment. And 
you’d better trade stun-guns with 
me. Mine is low.” 

Zorrel slipped the cord over his 
head, and handed the hand-carved 
Holy Bird to Hilford. “If you’re 
going back in there, you’ll ne^ it.” 
He took Hilford’s gun, and disap- 
peared into the trees. 

Hilford chose his position care- 
fully. He had to be invisible, and 
yet have a clear field of vision 
himself. He searched along the 
path, and finally settled down in 
a cluster of bushes ten feet from 
the trail. He did not know how 
long he would have to wait. He 
was thirsty and hungry, and weary 
from lack of sleep. He hoped he 
could hold out. 

An hour went by, and two hours. 
He fought to keep awake in the 
dreary silence. Suddenly he saw a 
flash of movement. A file of black- 
robed priests came into view. The 
Duke Two Fingers walked haughti- 
ly across his field of vision. Hilford 
knelt and trained his stun-gun on 
the path. The procession was mov- 
ing rapidly, and he would only have 



a fraction of a second. 

More priests passed, and sudden- 
ly Hilford saw the thing he was 
waiting for. A cage, towering gro- 
tesquely on the mountain path. It 
was all of eight feet tall, and black 
cloth was draped inside the bars, 
with a foot of air sp>ace left at top 
and bottom. Two black-robed 
priests strained under its weight at 
each comer. 

As Hilford took in these details 
his finger closed instinctively on the 
trigger. A focused beam at full 
power, from a distance of ten feet, 
would kill or permanently disable 
a man. It would certainly kill a 
bird. 

And as the cage passed from his 
view there was a convulsive flutter, 
and a Holy Bird of Kamm tum- 
bled to the floor of the cage. 

Consternation followed. The 
priests set down the cage, opened 
it, and tenderly lifted out the Bird. 
Terror and uncertainty gripped 
their faces. The Duke Two Fingers 
came charging back up the trail. 
Other black-robed dukes came for- 
ward, pushing their way through 
the excited crowd of priests. Hil- 
ford sensed that a furious argument 
was under way, but the fluttering 
fingers were concealed from him. 
The High Priest strode anxiously 
down the trail, and disappeared 
into the crowd. 

Hilford held his position, and 
waited. The procession finally 
turned, assumed a semblance of 
order, and marched back up the 
mountain towards the Temple of 
the Bird. 

Hilford followed at a safe dis- 
tance, and accosted one of the sen- 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



40 




tries at the entrance to the Temple. 
“What was all the excitement 
about?” 

The sentry wore a dazed expres- 
sion. “The Bird is dead! The 
Keeper of the Bird is deposed!” 

Hilford confidently reentered the 
Temple, and moved through the 
corridors at as fast a pace as was 
consistent with the dignity of his 
black robes. He found the corridor 
where the prisoners were confined, 
and opened the fifth door. 

There were only four men in the 
room, since Hilford and Zorrel 
had escaped. They sprang to their 
feet and stood humbly at attention. 

“Which one of you would like to 
escape?” Hilford demanded. 

They stared at him dumbly. 

He picked the youngest one, 
pulled the bright cape from his 
shoulders, and clothed him in the 
stolen black garments. “Bar the 
door as you go out,” he said. “If 
you wander around long enough, 
you should find the exit. Good 
luck!” 

The amazed man darted out, 
and they saw him shove the bar 
into place. 

One of the other prisoners sud- 
denly recognized Hilford. “You 
killed the priests!” he said, his fin- 
gers trembling with excitement. 

Hilford dropped onto a straw- 
padded bunk. “Aren’t you grate- 
ful?” he asked. He was thoroughly 
exhausted. He twisted uncomfort- 
ably, and drifted off to sleep. 



H e was awakened abruptly, 
and herded into the corridor 
with the other prisoners. The two 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



lines were formed, and they 
marched back along the winding 
passageways, to the room that 
opened into the arena. The scene 
was much the same as it had been 
before, but with a significant differ- 
ence. The royal box of the Duke 
Two Fingers was dark. The door 
under his box remained closed. He 
had allowed a Holy Bii'd to die, and 
he was disqualified. 

The bewildered prisoners were 
backed against the wall for num- 
bering. The High Priest entered 
stormily, and seized the metal jar. 
At that moment a prisoner from 
Hilford’s room stepped forward, 
and pointed at Hilford. 

“Him — he’s the one that killed 
the Holy Priests!” 

The High Priest whirled on Hil- 
ford, stepped close, sniffed doubt- 
fully. 

“No,” he signaled. 

The prisoner gestured excitedly. 
“He escaped, and then he came 
back wearing a black robe.” 

The High Priest stared, coldly at 
Hilford. “Take off his shoes,” he 
said finally. The High Priest studied 
his five-toed feet incredulously. 
“Take him first,” he said. The in- 
formant grinned broadly, and froze 
in terror a moment later when the 
High Priest gave him his reward by 
adding, “And take him second.” 
Hilford was quickly stripped. 
Hands clutched at his carving of 
the Holy Bird, and he clasp>ed it to 
him protectingly. The High Priest 
stepped forward, saw what it was, 
and sneered. “Let him have it!” 
Hilford was shoved into the cage, 
and priests began pushing it into 
the arena. 

41 




Birds flapped excitedly far above, 
and several dove on the priests and 
veered off. Hilford waited calmly 
in the center of the arena while the 
priests hurried away. He set his 
stun-gun at low intensity, with the 
broadest beam the small gun could 
supply. It might be fatal to kill a 
Bird, he knew; and it would cer- 
tainly be fatal if he did not keep 
them away. If his first setting was 
not the right one, he might not 
have a chance to adjust it. 

The cage jerked upwards. 

He stood in the center of the 
arena, pivoting slowly, with both 
hands extended above his head. 
One hand grasped the stun-gun. 
His posture was that of one invok- 
ing the gods. His audience was 
about to witness a miracle, and it 
would be best for Hilford if some- 
how it got the idea that it was a 
Holy Miracle. 

The first Bird plummeted down- 
wards, struck the gun’s beam, and 
fluttered comically away. Another 
came close enough to receive a 
vague shock, and circled warily. 
Then there was a sudden rush, and 
the air above him was filled with 
beating wings. 

He continued to pivot, and a sud- 
den wave of dizziness came over 
him. His head throbbed painfully. 
He staggered, nearly fell, and be- 
gan to edge towards the side of the 
arena. A Bird came at him from the 
rear at arm level, underneath the 
beam. Hilford’s blurring vision 
caught it just in time. He tilted the 
gun, and the Bird dropped to the 
floor of the arena, shuddered, and 
waddled away with its wings trail- 
ing helplessly. Hilford resumed his 



wavering pivot, and saw it flap into 
the air again. 

He was twenty feet from the wall 
of the arena, close enough to see 
the face of a duke who looked 
down on him hopefully. But it was 
not the duke he wanted. Another 
bird came at him at arm level, but 
circled back before he could aim 
the gun. The Birds were becoming 
cautious, and their rushes broke 
off farther and farther above him. 
But his head was a pounding, tear- 
ing agony, and he sensed that he 
was losing consciousness. He stag- 
gered on, arms still extended over 
his head, passing one duke’s box 
after another searching for a fa- 
miliar face. 

Suddenly he saw a flash of red 
hair. He summoned his last, failing 
strength, dashed for the open door, 
and collapsed as a priest swung it 
shut behind him. 

He was pulled to his feet, draped 
in black robes, and led up a flight 
of stone steps. The Duke C5ne 
Thumb stepped forward to greet 
him, stared at his face in open- 
mouthed astonishment. 

“I have kept my promise,” Hil- 
ford told him, and collapsed again. 

The duke helped him onto a 
cushioned dais, and knelt beside 
him. His hands trembled with ex- 
citement. “It is a miracle!” 

Hilford sank back weakly. “We 
must be cautious,” he said. “I do 
not trust the Duke Two Fingers.” 

“There’s nothing he can do now, 
I must reward you. All my daugh- 
ters are married, but perhaps . 

“Later,” Hilford said. “The 
Duke Two Fingers . .” 

Suddenly solemn, the Duke One

Thumb got to his feet. “We will 
go to the High Priest. He must 
give me my credentials and my 
Bird.” 

Priests made up a respectful es- 
cort. They entered the sumptuous 
quarters of the High Priest, where 
the walls were draped with black 
cloth and the furniture was plushly 
upholstered in black. The High 
Priest was there, with a dozen lesser 
priests. The Duke Two Fingers 
faced him arguing fiercely. 

“The Bird was sickly.” 

“The Bird was young, and in 
good health.” 

“Surely I cannot be guilty of neg- 
ligence if it dies before it reaches 
00 — before it is even out of the 
mountains!” 

Hilford understood the turmoil 
taking place behind the frosty 
countenance of the High Priest. He 
might circumvent custom by sub- 
terfuge, by drenching a prisoner 
with a repellent scent, but he could 
not do it openly without tearing 
asunder the entire religious struc- 
ture and undermining his own po- 
sition. The priests knew the High 
Priest was the brother of the Duke 
Two Fingers, and they were watch- 
ing alertly. Would he dare to dis- 
regard the venerable tradition they 
were all sworn to uphold? 

“The Bird was given into your 
position,” he said. “The law speaks 
plainly.” 

The Duke Two Fingers suddenly 
noticed the Duke One Thumb and 
his party, and he whirled angrily. 
“Yom' choice was not in order. It 
was made by an alien. Aliens are 
not permitted in the Temple.” He 
turned on the High Priest. “The 

SILENCE IS DEADLY 



law speaks plainly on that. You 
have brought aliens into the Tem- 
ple.” 

“I have offered their lives to the 
Birds, as is proper. The Birds alone 
have decided the outcome.” 

Hilford’s glance swept over the 
black-hooded men standing by the 
Duke Two Fingers, and he praised 
space for his photographic mem- 
ory. One face he had seen, his first 
day on Kamm, in the duke’s car- 
riage. And that face had had ears. 

He turned to the Duke One 
Thumb. “The Duke Two Fingers 
has brought aliens into the Tem- 
ple,” he said. “The priest on his 
right — remove his hood and you 
will see the signs.” 

The little duke moved decisively. 
He strode forward, jerked the hood 
from the man’s head, and stood 
staring. Ears! 

No one moved. The High Priest’s 
face was icily calm. “All present 
will remove their hoods,” he said. 

Glittering weapons flashed sud- 
denly, but a wave of priests over- 
whelmed the men. Hoods were 
ripped from the heads of the Duke 
Two Fingers’ escort. Two more 
pairs of ears were revealed to the 
startled priests. 

The High Priest turned slowly, 
and faced his brother. The long 
struggle for power between the two 
men blazed hatefully in the looks 
they exchanged. Each man had at- 
tempted to use the other, and each 
had failed. And Hilford guessed 
that when the Duke Two Fingers 
had commenced his dealings with 
the men of Haarn, he had not taken 
his brother into his confidence. 

Now the brother had his revenge. 

43 




He stepped back, and his fingers 
slowly spelled out his verdict. “The 
law speaks plainly. The life of an 
outsider in the Temple belongs to 
the Birds. And be he duke or com- 
moner, the life of one who willfully 
brings an outsider into the Tem- 
ple . 

The little Duke One Thumb 
raised both hands. “Only the dukes 
pass judgment on the life of a 
duke.” 

The High Priest lost his calm- 
ness. He rushed at the Duke One 
Thmnb, his fingers screaming his 
rage. “In the Temple of the Bird 
I am the master!” 

“The law of Kamm does not stop 
at the door of the Temple,” the lit- 
tle duke said. 

Hilford watched tensely. The 
High Priest poured out threats and 
invective. The Duke One Thumb 
tossed his red head scornfully, and 
kept his cahn gaze on the High 
Priest until he turned away un- 
easily. “When will the dukes sit in 
judgment?” he asked. 

“Immediately,” the little duke 
said. 

The High Priest gestured at the 
Duke Two Fingers. “Take him 
away.” 

TTxe duke sprang back, and ap- 
pealed to the priests. “I am the 
Keeper of the Bird, Your oath is 
sworn to me. I command you . .” 

The priests swarmed over him, 
and led him away. The High Priest 
pointed scornfully at the men of 
Haam. “Give them to the Birds.” 

Somehow Hilford felt no desire 
to see the Duke Two Fingers come 
to judgment. He was not certain 
that he would be admitted, so he 



followed along after the men of 
Haarn. They were thrust into the 
arena without ceremony. They were 
not even stripped. For a few min- 
utes they milled about confusedly, 
looking vainly at the closed doors 
that ringed the arena. As the first 
Birds descended upon them one 
slipped out of his robes and 
whipped them through the air. The 
action startled the Birds, and they 
circled warily. 

They quickly regained their con- 
fidence, and as they circled closer 
strange things happened to the men 
of Haarn. They collapsed and 
groveled on the bare rock floor. 
Their hands tore futilely at the 
smooth surface. Blood spurted from 
their ears, and their arms and 1^ 
flailed weakly and were still. Hfl- 
ford wearily turned away from the 
sickening ripping of talons. His as- 
signment was completed. He had 
identified the KLammian secret 
weapon. 



A t the Federation Base on 
L Kanun’s largest moon, Hil- 
ford was finishing his report. “Fol- 
lowing the execution of the Duke 
Two Fingers, his nephew was in- 
stalled as ruler of the Flat Prov- 
ince. He is an intelligent and con- 
scientious young man, and he 
should make an excellent duke. No 
more agents of Haam have been 
discovered, and we doubt that there 
are more. Men with ears would 
find it difficult to hide on Kamm. 
The new Keeper of the Bird is an 
honest and courageous man with 
an instinct for leadership. He has 
the complete support of the Sea- 



44 



LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




men’s League, and he will welcome 
advisors from the Federation. The 
next five years should see a dra- 
matic change of direction in the 
history of Kamm.” 

Hilford seated himself, and in- 
dulged in a fit of coughing. The 
unaccustomed vocal exercise had 
sadly irritated his throat. He leaned 
back and studied the faces before 
him — the military brass, the diplo- 
matic brass, the intelligence brass. 

The diplomatic brass spoke first, 
and Hilford fumbled for a com- 
municator, turned up the volume, 
and listened. 

“I move that we commend Spe- 
cial Agent Hilford for an excellent 
piece of work.” 

An agitated Admiral Lantz 
leaped to his feet, his scholarly face 
flushed with excitement. “The se- 
cret weapon! You didn’t mention 
the secret weapon!” 

“That calls for a special report,” 
Hilford said. “Zorrel?” 

The young agent hurried out, 
and returned with some scientific 
apparatus which the distinguished 
audience eyed suspiciously. 

“I’ve recorded some bird talk 
from the Kammian Holy Bird,” 
Hilford said. “Would you like to 
hear it?” 

The muttered assent did not 
reach him through the communi- 
cator. He asked again, and Admiral 
Lantz bellowed, “Yes!” 

“I’ll let you hear it for exactly 
five seconds. And please note — this 
is an oscillograph. It gives us a pic- 
ture of sound waves. You can listen 
to this sound and watch it at the 
same time.” 

He stood with a stop watch in 
SILENCE IS DEADLY 



his hand, and Zorrel turned off the 
machine when he signaled. 

“I didn’t hear a thing,” the ad- 
miral called. “And that line never 
moved. There’s nothing there but 
silence.” 

“Ah! Remember — Kamm is the 
silent planet. This is silent bird 
talk.” 

The admiral got to his feet with 
the air of one about to stomp out, 
and was hauled back into place by 
another admiral. Ernst Wilkes 
called to Hilford, “Go on, please.” 
The Sector Chief of Intelligence 
looked amused. 

“I promise you, gentlemen,” Hil- 
ford said politely, “that this is the 
deadliest silence in the universe. 
We’ll wait five minutes, and then 
I’ll give you step two.” 

While they waited, Zorrel ad- 
justed the oscillograph. He darted 
to the door and led in a giant griff 
hound, conveniently borrowed from 
a sentry. 

“In the first test,” Hilford said, 
“the oscillograph was set to register 
sounds within the normal range of 
human hearing — roughly up to 
25,000 cycles. Now I’ll move the 
upper limit as far as it will go. 
Watch again, for five seconds.” 

The line on the oscillograph sud- 
denly twisted convulsively. At the 
same time Hilford was flung to the 
floor as the dog dashed against him 
in a frantic effort to escape. iZorrel 
leaped to switch off the machine, 
and the dog crept under a table 
and howled mournfully. 

“You see, gentlemen,” Hilford 
said, “how deadly that silence is. 
The dog can hear it — or part of it. 
You can’t hear a thing, but all the 

45 




same you are being bombarded 
with a peculiarly oscillating sound 
wave of a murderous intensity. 
With that machine at normal vol- 
ume, every person in this room 
would be dead within a minute — 
except Zorrel and I, because we 
have no ears at the moment. And 
we’d be acutely uncomfortable. 

“The Holy Bird is a legendary 
monster on Kamm, for good rea- 
son. Folklore claims that the birds 
once ruled the planet, and it may 
be right. Somewhere back in the 
dim mists of antiquity those birds 
began to develop a peculiar method 
of catching their prey, and as their 
power developed it had a tremen- 
dous impact on the entire course of 
evolution on Kamm. Their prey 
had to evolve also, or become ex- 
tinct. That was the course of Kam- 
mian evolution. The birds devel- 
oped more power, their prey de- 
veloped more immunity. Finally 
the birds became all-powerful, and 
their prey became completely im- 
mune. Man adapted to the birds by 
losing his hearing, and eventually, 
his ears. And when his hearing was 
gone and he became the ruling 
species on the planet, he continued 
to fear the birds. He captured 
them, and worshipped them.” 
There was a long silence, inter- 
rupted by Wilkes. “What happened 
to the trade commissioners?” 

“We can only guess. By accident 
or on purpose, the Ehike Two 
Fingers exposed them to his private 



bird. He was probably shocked him- 
self, at what happened, and be- 
cause he feared the Federation he 
had the bodies dumped into the 
street. And now, if no one wants to 
hear it again, 2^rrel will erase the 
bird talk. We don’t want an inno- 
cent technician committing suicide 
by accident. When does my leave 
start?” 

“Immediately,” Wilkes said. 
“Two months.” 

“You promised me six months.” 
“I can’t spare you for six months. 
Where do you want to go? Some 
nice quiet resort?” 

“I want my ears back,” Hilford 
said. “And then I’m going to spend 
ail six months in the aft cabin of a 
space tug, listening to the engines.” 
A diplomat waved his arm anx- 
iously. “What about the future of 
Kanm?” 

Hilford was suddenly serious. 
“The Kammians don’t realize it, 
but normal men could never in- 
vade Kamm. One Holy Bird, 
turned loose in an enemy camp at 
night, could wipe out an army. 
Even if an invader attempted to kill 
all the birds, he could never be 
certain that there wasn’t one left, 
and one would be enough. Aliens 
will live on Kamm only with the 
gracious permission of the natives. 
The future of Kamm is definitely 
for Kammians. Or, to put it an- 
other way — he grinned broadly 
“ — that planet is for the birds!”

T he hunters were necessary y of 



course — but there was the 



other side of the picture too. 



The first of the morons, as they 
were popularly called, though they 
were totally lacking in intelligence, 
were horn in 1971, eleven years 
after the Mutual Retaliation phase 
of the big war-that-no-one-started, 
the majority of them near the big, 
bombed-out cities. By 1973, with 
the aid of the electron microscope, 
the scientists had learned all about 
it. Parents and offspring were steri-

lized and the offspring placed in 
state institutions. By 1983 there 
were too many of them. A new 
solution to the impossible situation 
was tried, large isolated areas in the 
south where the climate was mild 
were made into preserves for them. 
In the wilds the morons handed 
into small herds that showed no in- 
clination to roam. By 1985 no more 
of the morons were being horn. 



thanks to the sterilization of all 
parents carrying the contaminated 
gene. It was thought the problem 
was permanently solved, through 
perfect cooperation between sci- 
ence, the government, and the pub- 
lic. If the contamination had not 
been weeded out of the race one 
fourth of every generation for all 
the future would have been with- 
out any intelligence whatever. 



PRESERVE 




But here and there had been 
natural births, unattended by a doc- 
tor; and parental love coupled 
with fear of being sterilized and 
thus denied further parenthood had 
brought into existence a few thou- 
sand unsterilized morons, hidden 
away in attic rooms or in base- 
ments. And to these parents the 
Preserves offered the logical solu- 
tion too — drive into the nearest 
Preserve and turn the child loose 
with its kind. Thus, a new genera- 
tion came into being in the scat- 
tered herds, and by 2010 A.D, a 
new problem had come into being. 
Thanks to impurities in the moron 
strain or to wandering renegades — 
or both — a few normally intelligent 
offspring were appearing in the 
herds. There was danger of these 
recontaminating the race, if they 
left the herds, learned to speak, 
wear clothes . , 

In 2010 the government at- 
tempted a mass sterilization of the 
herds but the herds were too wild 
by now, and the males too danger- 
ous, so the sterilization program 
was abandoned and a new plan 
substituted. The government Hunt- 
ers came into being, small patrol 
groups whose job was to pick off 
the renegades and any members of 
the herds that were intelligent. 



66TJI.HI.HI!” Big One shouted, 

JLl and heaved erect with the 
front end of It. 

“Hi-hi-hi,” Fat One and the 
dozen others echoed more mildly, 
lifting wherever they could get a 
hold on It. 

It was lifted and borne forward 
50 



in a half crouching trot. 

“Hi-hi hi-hi-hihihi,” Elf chanted, 
running and skipping alongside tljie 
panting men and their massive 
burden. 

It was carried forward through 
the lush grass for perhaps fifty feet. 

“Ah-ah-ah,” Big One sighed 
loudly, slowly letting the front end 
of It down until it dug into the soft 
black soil. 

“Ahhh,” Fat One and the others 
sighed, letting go and standing up, 
stretching aching back muscles, 
rubbing cramped hands. 

“Ah-ah-ah-^-ah-ah,” Elf sang, 
running around and in between 
the resting men. He came too close 
to Big One and was sent sprawling 
by a quick, good humored push. 

Everyone laughed. Big One 
laughing the loudest. Then Big One 
lifted Elf to his feet and patted 
him on the back affectionately, a 
broad grin forming a toothy gap 
at the top of his bushy black beard. 

Elf answered the grin with one 
of his own, and at that moment his 
ever present yearning to grow up to 
be the biggest and the strongest 
like Big One flowed through him 
with new strength. 

Abruptly Big One leaped to the 
front end of It, shouting “Hi-hi- 
HI!” 

“Hi-hi-hi,” the others echoed, 
scrambling to their places. Once 
again It was borne forward for 
fifty feet — and again and again, 
across the broad meadowland. 

A vast matting of blackberry 
brambles came into view off to one 
side. Big One veered his course to- 
ward it. The going was uphill now, 
so the forward surges shortened to 

ROG PHILLIPS 




forty feet, then thirty. By the time 
they reached the blackberries they 
were wet and glossy with sweat. 

It was a healthy patch, loaded 
with large ripe berries. The men 
ate hungrily at first, then more 
leisurely, pointing to one another’s 
stained beards and laughing. As 
they denuded one area they leaped 
to It, carried it another ten feet, 
and started stripping another sec- 
tion, never getting more than a few 
feet from It. 

Elf picked his blackberries with 
first one then another of the men. 
When his hunger was satisfied he 
became mischievous, picking a 
handful of berries and squashing 
them against the back or the chest 
of the nearest man and running 
away, laughing. It was dangerous 
sport, he knew, because if one of 
them caught him he would be 
tossed into the brambles. 

Eventually they all had their fill, 
and thanks to Elf looked as though 
they were oozing blackberry juice 
from every pore. The sun was in 
its mid-aftemoon position. In the 
distance a line of white-barked 
trees could be seen — evidence of a 
stream. 

“Hi-hi-hi!” Big One shouted. 

The journey toward the trees be- 
gan. It was mostly downhill, so the 
forward spurts were often as much 
as a hundred feet. 

Before they could hear the water 
they could smell it. They grunted 
their delight at the smell, a rich 
fish odor betokening plenty of food. 
Intermingled with this odor was 
the spicy scent of eucalyptus. 

They pushed forward with re- 
newed zeal so that the sweat ran 



down their skins, dissolving the 
berry juices and making rivulets 
that looked like purple blood. 

When less than a hundred yards 
from the stream, which was still 
hidden beyond the tall grasses and 
the trees lining its bank, they heard 
the sound of voices, high pitched — 
women’s voices. They became un- 
easy and nervous. Their surges for- 
ward shortened to ten feet, their 
rest periods became longer, they 
searched worriedly for signs of mo- 
tion through the trees. 

They changed their course to 
arrive a hundred yards down- 
stream from the source of the wom- 
en’s voices. Soon they reached the 
edge of the tree belt. It was more 
difficult to carry It through the 
scatterings of bushes. Too, they 
would get part way through the 
trees and run into trees too close 
together to get It past them, and 
have to back out and try another 
place. It took almost two hours 
to work through the trees to the 
bank of the stream. 

Only Elf recognized the place 
they finally broke through as the 
place they had left more than two 
days before. In that respect he 
knew he was different, not only 
from Big One and other grownups, 
but also all other Elfs except one, 
a girl Elf. He had known it as 
long as he could remember. He 
had learned it from many little 
things. For example, he had rec- 
ognized the place when they 
reached it. Big One and the others 
never remembered anything for 
long. In getting It through the 
trees they blundered as they al- 
ways had, and got through by trial 



GAME PRESERVE 



51 




and error with no memory of past 
blunderings. 

Elf was different in another way, 
too. He could make more sounds 
than the others. Sometimes he 
would keep a little It with him un- 
til it gave him a feeling of security 
almost as strong as the big It, then 
wander off alone with It and play 
with making sounds. “Bz-bz. Walla- 
walla-walla-rue-rue-la-lo-hi. Da !” 
and all kinds of sounds. It excited 
him to be able to make different 
sounds and put them together so 
that they pleased his hearing, but 
such sounds made the others avoid 
him and look at him from a safe 
distance, with worried expressions, 
so he had learned not to make 
different sounds within earshot of 
the others. 

The women and Elfs were up- 
stream a hundred yards, where 
they always remained. From the 
way they were milling around and 
acting alarmed it was evident to 
Elf they could no more remember 
the men having been here a few 
days before than the men could 
remember it themselves. It would 
be two or three days before they 
slowly lost their fear of one an- 
other; It would be the women and 
their Elfs who would cautiously ap- 
proach, holding their portable Its 
clutched for security, until, finally 
losing all fear, they would join into 
one big group for a while. 

Big One and the others carried 
It right to the water’s edge so they 
could get into the water without 
ever being far from It. They shiv- 
ered and shouted excitedly as they 
bathed. Fat One screamed with de- 

52 



light as he held a squirming fish 
up for the others to see. He bit 
into it with strong white teeth, wa- 
ter dripping from his heavy brown 
beard. Renewed hunger possessed 
him. He gobbled the fish and be- 
gan searching for another. He al- 
ways caught two fish for any other 
man’s one, which was why he was 
fat. 

Elf himself caught a fish. After 
eating it he lay on the grassy bank 
looking up at the white billowing 
clouds in the blue sky. The sun 
was now near the horizon, half hid- 
den behind a cloud, sending diver- 
gent ramps of light downward. The 
clouds on the western horizon were 
slowly taking on color until red, 
orange, and green separated into 
definite areas. The soft murmur of 
the stream formed a lazy back- 
ground to the excited voices of the 
men. From upstream, faintly, drift- 
ed the woman and Elf sounds. 

Here, close to the ground, the 
rich earthy smell was stronger than 
that of the stream. After a time a 
slight breeze sprang up, bringing 
with it other odors, that of distant 
pines, the pungent eucalyptus, a 
musky animal scent. 

Big One and the others were out 
of the water, finally. Half asleep. 
Elf watched them move It up to 
dry ground. As though that were 
what the sun had been waiting for, 
it sank rapidly below the horizon. 

The clouds where the sun had 
been seemed now to blaze for a 
time with a smoldering redness that 
cooled to black. The stars came 
out, one by one. 

A multitude of snorings erupted 
into the night. Elf crept among the 

ROG PHILLIPS 




sleeping forms until he found Big 
One, and settled down for the 
night, his head against Big One’s 
chest, his right hand resting against 
the cool smooth metal of It. 



E lf awoke with the bright 
morning sun directly in his 
eyes. Big One was gone, already 
wading in the stream after fish. 
Some of the others were with him. 
A few were still sleeping. 

Elf leaped to his feet, paused to 
stretch elaborately, then splashed 
into the stream. As soon as he 
caught a fish he climbed out onto 
the bank and ate it. Then he turned 
to his search for a little It. There 
were many lying around, all exactly 
alike. He studied several, not touch- 
ing some, touching and even nudg- 
ing others. Since they all looked 
alike it was more a matter of feel 
than any real difference that he 
looked for. One and only one 
seemed to be the It. Elf returned 
his attention to it several times. 

Finally he picked it up and car- 
ried it over to the big It, and hid it 
underneath. Big One, with shouts 
of sheer exuberance, climbed up 
onto the bank dripping water. He 
grinned at Elf. 

Elf looked in the direction of the 
women and other Elfs. Some of 
them were wandering in his direc- 
tion, each carrying an It of some 
sort, many of them similar to the 
one he had chosen. 

In sudden alaim at the thought 
that someone might steal his new 
It, Elf rescued it from its hiding 
place. He tiied to hide it behind 
him when any of the men looked 

GAME PRESERVE 



his way. They scorned an individu- 
al It and, as men, preferred an It 
too heavy for one person. 

As the day advanced, women 
and Elfs approached nearer, pre- 
tending to be unaware at times that 
the men were here, at other times 
openly fleeing back, overcome by 
p^nic. 

The men never went farther than 
twenty feet from the big It. But as 
the women came closer the men 
grew surly toward one another. By 
noon two of them were trying to 
pick a fight with anyone who would 
stand up to them. 

Elf clutched his little It closely 
and moved cautiously downstream 
until he was twenty feet from the 
big It. Tentatively he went another 
few feet — farther than any of the 
men dared go from the big It. 
At first he felt secure, then panic 
overcame him and he ran back, 
dropping the little It. He touched 
the big It until the panic was gone. 
After a while he went to the little 
It and picked it up. He walked 
around, carrying it, until he felt 
secure with it again. Finally he 
went downstream again, twenty 
feet, twenty-five feet, thirty . 
He felt panic finally, but not over- 
whelmingly. When it became al- 
most unendurable he calmly turned 
around and walked back. 

Confidence came to him. An 
hour later he went downstream 
until he was out of sight of the big 
It and the men. Security seemed to 
flow warmly from the little It. 

Excitement possessed Elf. He ran 
here and there, clutching It closely 
so as not to drop it and lose it. He 
felt free. 



53 




“BdlboOj” he said aloud, experi- 
mentally. He liked the sounds. 
“Bdlboo-bdlboo-bdlboo.” He saw a 
berry bush ahead and ran to it to 
munch on the delicious fruit. “Rid- 
dle piddle biddle,” he said. It 
sounded nice. 

He ran on, and after a time he 
found a soft grassy spot and 
stretched out on his back, holding 
It carelessly in one hand. He looked 
up and up, at a layer of clouds go- 
ing in one direction and another 
layer above it going in another di- 
rection. 

Suddenly he heard voices. 

At first he thought the wind must 
have changed so that it was carry- 
ing the voices of the men to him. 
He lay there listening. Slowly he 
realized these voices were different. 
They were putting sounds together 
like those he made himself. 

A sense of wonder possessed him. 
How could there be anyone besides 
himself who could do that? 

Unafraid, yet filled with caution, 
he clutched It closely to his chest 
and stole in the direction of the 
sounds. 

After going a hundred yards he 
saw signs of movement through the 
trees. He dropped to the ground 
and lay still for a moment, then 
gained courage to rise cautiously, 
ready to run. Stooping low, he stole 
forward until he could see several 
moving figures. Darting from tree 
to tree he moved closer to them, 
listening with greater excitement 
than he had ever known to the 
smoothly flowing variety of beauti- 
ful sounds they were making. 

This was something new, a sort 
of game they must be playing. One 

54 



voice would make a string of sounds 
then stop, another would make a 
string of different sounds and stop, 
a third would take it up. They 
were good at it, too. 

But the closer he got to them the 
more puzzled he became. They were 
shaped somewhat like people, they 
carried Its, they had hands and 
faces like people. That’s as far as 
the similarity went. Their feet were 
solid, their arms, legs, and body 
were not skin at all but strangely 
colored and unliving in appear- 
ance. Their faces were smooth like 
women’s, their hair short like 
babies’, their voices deep like men’s. 

And the Its they carried were 
unlike any Elf had ever seen. Not 
only that, each of them carried 
more than one. 

T hat was an idea! Elf became so 
excited he almost forgot to keep 
hidden. If you had more than one 
It, then if something happened to 
one you would still feel secure! 

He resisted the urge to return to 
the stream and search for another 
little It to give him extra security. 
If he did that he might never again 
find these creatures that were so 
like men and yet so different. So 
instead, he filed the idea away to 
use at the earliest opportunity and 
followed the strange creatures, 
keeping well hidden from them. 

Soon Elf could hear the shouts 
of the men in the distance. From 
the behavior of the creatures ahead, 
they had heard those shouts too. 
They changed their direction so as 
to reach the stream a hundred 
yards or more downstream at about 
the spot where Elf had left. They 

ROG PHILLIPS 




made no voice sounds now that Elf 
could hear. They clutched their 
strangely shaped long Its before 
them tensely as though feeling 
greater security that way, their 
heads turning this way and that as 
they searched for any movement 
ahead. 

They moved purposefully. An 
overwhelming sense of kinship 
brought tears to Elfs eyes. These 
creatures were his kind. Their dif- 
ferences from him were physical 
and therefore superficial, and even 
if those differences were greater it 
wouldn’t have mattered. 

He wanted, suddenly, to run to 
them. But the thought of it sent 
fear through him. Also they might 
run in panic from him if he sud- 
denly revealed himself. 

It would have to be a mutual 
aproach, he felt. He was used to 
seeing them now. In due time he 
would reveal himself for a brief 
moment to them. Later he would 
stay in the open and watch them, 
making no move to approach until 
they got used to him being around. 
It might take days, but eventually, 
he felt sure, he could join them 
without causing them to panic. 

After all, there had been the 
time when he absented himself 
from the men for three whole days 
and when he returned they had 
forgotten him, and his sudden ap- 
pearance in their midst had sent 
even Big One into spasms of fear. 
Unable to flee from the security of 
the big It, and unable to bear his 
presence among them without be- 
ing used to him, they had all fallen 
on the ground in a fit. He had had 
to retreat and wait until they re- 

GAME PRESERVE 



covered. Then, slowly, he had let 
them get used to his being in sight 
before approaching again. It had 
taken two full days to get to the 
point where they would accept him 
once more. 

That experience. Elf felt, would 
be valuable to remember now. He 
wouldn’t want to plunge these 
creatures into fits or see them scat- 
ter and run away. 

Also, he was too afraid right now 
to reveal himself even though every 
atom of his being called for their 
companionship. 

Suddenly he made another im- 
jxDrtant discovery. Some of the Its 
these creatures carried had some- 
thing like pliable vines attached to 
them so they could be hung about 
the neck! The thought was so stag- 
gering that Elf stopped and exam- 
ined his It to see if that could be 
done to it. It was twice as long as 
his hand and round one way, taper- 
ing to a small end that opened to 
the hollow inside. It was too smooth 
to hold with a pliable vine unless — 
He visualized pliable vines woven 
together to hold It. He wasn’t sure 
how it could be done, but maybe it 
could. 

He set the idea aside for the fu- 
ture and caught up with the crea- 
tures again, looking at them with a 
new emotion, awe. The ideas he 
got just from watching them were 
so staggering he was getting dizzy! 

Anoffier new thought hit him. 
He rejected it at once as being too 
fantastic. It returned. Leaves are 
thin and pliable and can be 
wrapped around small objects like 
pebbles. Gould it be that these 
creatures were really men of some 

55 




sort, with bodies like men, covered 
with something thin like leaves are 
thin? It was a new and dizzy height 
in portable securities, and hardly 
likely. No. He rejected the idea 
with finality and turned his mind 
to other things. 

He knew now where they could 
reach the stream. He decided to 
circle them and get ahead of them. 
For the next few minutes this oc- 
cupied his full attention, leaving 
no room for crazy thoughts. 

He reached the stream and hid 
behind some bushes where he 
would have a quick line of re- 
treat if necessary. He clutched It 
tightly and waited. In a few mo- 
ments he saw the first of the 
creatures emerge a hundred feet 
away. The others soon joined the 
first. Elf stole forward from con- 
cealment to concealment until he 
was only fifteen feet from them. 
His heart was pounding with a 
mixture of fear and excitement. 
His knuckles were white from 
clutching It. 

The creatures were still carry- 
ing on their game of making sounds, 
but now in an amazing new way 
that made them barely audible. 
Elf listened to the incredibly 
varied sounds, enraptured. 

“This colony seems to have re- 
mained pure.” 

“You never can tell.” 

“No, you never can tell. Get 
out the binoculars and look, Joe.” 
“Not just yet, Harold. I’m look- 
ing to see if I can spot one whose 
behavior shows intelligence.” 

Elf ached to imitate some of the 
beautiful combinations of sounds. 
He wanted to experiment and see 

56 



if he could make the softly muted 
voices. He had an idea how it 
might be done, not make a noise 
in your throat but breathe out and 
form the sounds with your mouth 
just like you were uttering them 
aloud. 

One of the creatures fumbled at 
an It hanging around his neck. 
The top of it hinged back. He 
reached in and brought out a 
gleaming It and held it so that it 
covered his eyes. He was facing 
toward the men upstream and 
stood up slowly. 

“See something, Joe?” 

Suddenly Elf was afraid. Was this 
some kind of magic? He had often 
puzzled over the problem of 
whether things were there when he 
didn’t look at them. He had ex- 
perimented, closing his eyes then 
opening them suddenly to see if 
things were still there, and they 
always were; but maybe this was 
magic to make the men not be 
there. Elf waited, watching up- 
stream, but Big One and the others 
did not vanish. 

The one called Joe chuckled. 
“The toy the adult males have 
would be a museum piece if it 
were intact. A 1960 Ford, I think. 
Only one wheel on it, right front.” 

Elf’s attention jerked back. One 
of the creatures was reaching over 
his shoulder, lifting on the large 
It fastened there. The top of the 
It pulled back. He reached inside, 
bringing out something that made 
Elf almost exclaim aloud. It was 
shaped exactly like the little It 
Elf was carrying, but it glistened in 
the sunlight and its interior was 
filled with a richly brown fluid. 

ROG PHILLIPS 




“Anyone else want a coke?” 

“This used to be a picnic area,” 
the one called Joe said, not taking 
his eyes from the binoculars. “I 
can see a lot of pop bottles lying 
around in the general area of that 
wreck of a Ford.” 

While Elf watched, breathless, 
the creature reached inside the 
skin of his hip and brought out a 
very small It and did something to 
the small end of the hollow It. 
Putting the very small It back under 
the skin of his hip, he put the hol- 
low It to his lips and tilted it. 
Elf watched the brown liquid drain 
out. Here was magic. Such an It 
— the very one he carried — could 
be filled with water from the 
stream and carried around to drink 
any time! 

When the It held no more liquid 
the creature dropped it to the 
ground. Elf could not take his 
eyes from it. He wanted it more 
than he had ever wanted anything. 
They might forget it. Sometimes 
the women dropped their Its and 
forgot them, picking up another 
one instead, and these creatures 
had beardless faces like women. Be- 
sides, each of them carried so many 
Its that they would feel just as 
secure without this one. 

So many Its! One of the crea- 
tures held a flat white It in one 
hand and a very slim It shaped like 
a straight section of a bush stem, 
pointed at one end, with which he 
scratched on the white It at times, 
leaving black designs. 

“There’ re fourteen males,” the 
one called Joe whispered. The other 
wrote it down. 

The way these creatures did 
GAME PRESERVE 



things. Elf decided, was very similar 
to the way Big One and the other 
men went at moving the big It. 
They were very much like men in 
their actions, these creatures. 

“Eighty-five or six females.” 

“See any signs of intelligent 
action yet?” 

“No. A couple of the males are 
fighting. Probably going to be a 
mating free-for-all tomorrow or 
next day. There’s one! Just a 
minute, 1 want to make sure. It’s 
a little girl, maybe eight or nine 
years old. Good forehead. Her 
eyes definitely lack that large 
marble-like quality of the sub- 
moron parent species. She’s in- 
telligent all right. She’s drawing 
something in the sand with a stick. 
Give me your rifle, Bill, it’s got a 
better telescope sight on it than 
mine, and I don’t want her to 
suffer.” 

That little It, abandoned on the 
ground. Elf wanted it. One of the 
creatures would be sure to pick it 
up. Elf worried. He would never 
get it then. If only the creatures 
would go, or not notice him. If 
only — 

The creature with the thing over 
his eyes put it back where he had 
gotten it out of the thing hang- 
ing from his shoulder. He had 
taken one of the long slim things 
from another of the creatures and 
placed the thick end against his 
shoulder, the small end pointed up- 
stream. The others were standing, 
their backs to Elf, all of them look- 
ing upstream. If they would re- 
main that way, maybe he could 
dart out and get the little It. In 
another moment they might lose 

57 




interest in whatever they were 
watching. 

Elf darted out from his conceal- 
ment and grabbed the It off the 
ground, and in the same instant 
an ear shattering sound erupted 
from the long slim thing against 
the creature’s shoulder. 

“Got her!” the creature said. 

Paralyzed with fright, Elf stood 
motionless. One of the creatures 
started to turn his way. At the 
last instant Elf darted back to his 
place of concealment. His heart 
was pounding so loudly he felt 
sure they would hear it. 

“You sure, Joe?” 

“Right through the head. She 
never knew what happened.” 

Elf held the new It close to him, 
ready to run if he were discovered. 
He didn’t dare look at it yet. It 
wouldn’t notice if he just held it 
and felt it without looking at it. It 
was cold at first, colder than the 
water in the stream. Slowly it 
warmed. He dared to steal a quick 
glance it it. It gleamed at him as 
though possessed of inner life. A 
new feeling of security grew with- 
in him, greater than he had ever 
known. The other It, the one half 
filled with dried mud, and deeply 
scratched from the violent rush of 
water over it when the stream went 
over its banks, lay forgotten at his 
feet. 

“Well, that finishes the survey 
trip for this time.” 

Elf paid little attention to the 
voice whispers now, too wrapped up 
in his new feelings. 

“Yes, and quite a haul. Twenty- 
two colonies — three more than ten 

58 



years ago. Fourteen of them uncon- 
taminated, seven with only one or 
two intelligent offspring to kill, 
only one colony so contaminated we 
had to wipe it out altogether. And 
one renegade.” 

“The renegades are growing 
scarcer every time. Another ten or 
twenty years and they’ll be extinct.” 

“Then there won’t be any more 
intelligent offspring in these colo- 
nies.” 

“Let’s get going. It’ll be dark in 
another hour or so.” 

The creatures were hiding some 
of their Its under their skin, in their 
carrying cases. There was a feeling 
about them of departure. Elf waited 
until they were on the move, back 
the way they had come, then he 
followed at a safe distance. 

He debated whether to show him- 
self now or wait. The sun was going 
down in the sky now. It wouldn’t 
be long until it went down for the 
night. Should he wait until in the 
morning to let them get their first 
glimpse of him? 

He smiled to himself. He had 
plenty of time. Tomorrow and to- 
morrow. He would never return to 
Big One and the other men. Men 
or creatures, he would join with 
these new and wonderful creatures. 
They were his kind. 

He thought of the girl Elf. They 
were her kind, too. If he could 
only get her to come with him. 

On sudden impulse he decided 
to try. These creatures were going 
back the same way they had come. 
If he ran, and if she came right 
with him, they could catch up with 
the creatures before they went so 
far they would lose them. 

ROG PHILLIPS 




He turned back, going carefully 
until he could no longer see the 
creatures, then he ran. He headed 
directly toward the place where 
the women and Elfs stayed. They 
would not be so easily alarmed as 
the men because there were so 
many of them they couldn’t re- 
member one another, and one more 
or less of the Elfs went unnoticed. 

When he reached the clearing 
he slowed to a walk, looking for 
her. Ordinarily he didn’t have to 
look much. She would see him and 
come to him, smiling in recognition 
of the fact that he was the only one 
like her. 

He became a little angry. Was 
she hiding? Then he saw her. He 
went to her. She was on her 
stomach, motionless as though 
asleep, but something was dif- 
ferent. There was a hole in one 
side of her head, and on the op- 
posite side it was tom open, r^ 
and grayish white, with — He knelt 
down and touched her. She had 
the same inert feel to her that 
others had had who never again 
moved. 

He studied her head curiously. 
He had never seen anything like 
this. He shook her. She remained 
limp. He sighed. He knew what 
would happen now. It was already 
happening. The odor was very 
faint yet, but she would not move 
again, and day after day the odor 
would get stronger. No one liked 
it. 

He would have to hurry or he 
would lose the creatures. He turned 
and ran, never looking back. Once 
he started to cry, then stopped in 

GAME PRESERVE 



surprise. Why had he seen crying, 
he wondered. He hadn’t hurt him- 
self. 

He caught up with the crea- 
tures. They were hurrying now, 
their long slender Its balanced on 
one shoulder, the big end resting 
in the palm of the hand. They no 
longer moved cautiously. Shortly 
it was new country. Elf had never 
been this far from the stream. Big 
One more or less led the men, and 
always more or less followed the 
same route in cross country trips. 

The creatures didn’t spend hours 
stumbling along impossible paths. 
They looked ahead of them and 
selected a way, and took it. Also 
they didn’t have a heavy It to 
transport, fifty feet at a time. Elf 
began to sense they bad a destina- 
tion in mind. Probably the place 
they lived. 



J UST AHEAD WAS a steep 
bank, higher than a man, run- 
ning in a long line. The creatures 
climbed the bank and vanished on 
the other side. Cautiously Elf fol- 
lowed them, heading toward a large 
stone with It qualities at the top 
of the bank from whose conceal- 
ment he could see where they had 
gone without being seen. He 
reached it and cautiously peeked 
around it. Just below him were 
the creatures, but what amazed Elf 
was the sight of the big It. 

It was very much like the big It 
the men had, except that there 
were differences in shape, and in- 
stead of one round thing at one 
comer, it had one at each corner 
and rested on them so that it was 



59 




held off the ground. It glistened in- 
stead of being dull. It had a strange 
odor that was quite strong. 

The creatures were putting some 
of their Its into it, two of them had 
actually climbed into it — something 
neither Elf nor the men had ever 
dared to do with their own big It. 

Elf took his eyes off of it for a 
moment to marvel at the ground. 
It seemed made of stone, but such 
stone as he had never before seen. 
It was an even width with edges 
going in straight lines that para- 
lelled the long narrow hill on 
which he stood, and on the other 
side was a similar hill, extending 
as far as the eye could see. 

He returned his attention to the 
creatures and their big It. The 
creatures had all climbed into it 
now. Possibly they were settling 
down for the night, though it was 
still early for that . 

No matter. There was plenty of 
time. Tomorrow and tomorrow. 
Elf would show himself in the 
morning, then run away. He would 
come back again after a while and 
show himself a little longer, giv- 
ing them time to get used to him 
so they wouldn’t panic. 

They were playing their game 
of making voice sounds to one 
another again. It seemed their 
major preoccupation. Elf thought 
how much fun it would be to be 
one of them, making voice sounds 
to his heart’s content. 

“I don’t see why the govern- 
ment doesn’t wipe out the whole 
lot,” one of them was saying. “It’s 
hopeless to keep them alive. Feeble- 
mindedness is dominant in them. 
They can’t be absorbed into the 

60 



race again, and any intelligent off- 
spring they get from mating with 
a renegade would start a long line 
of descendents, at least one fourth 
of whom would be mindless idiots.” 

“Well,” another of them said, 
“It’s one of those things where 
there is no answer. Wipe them out, 
and next year it would be all the 
blond haired people to be wiped 
out to keep the race of dark haired 
people pure, or something. Probab- 
ly in another hundred years nature 
will take care of the problem by 
wiping them out for us. Meanwhile 
we game wardens must make the 
rounds every two years and weed 
out any of them we can find that 
have intelligence.” He looked up 
the embankment but did not notice 
Elf’s head, concealed partially by 
the grass around the concrete 
marker. “It’s an easy job. Any of 
them we missed seeing this time, 
we’ll probably get next time. In 
the six or eight visits we make be- 
fore the intelligent ones can become 
adults and mate we always find 
them.” 

“What I hate is when they see 
us, those intelligent ones,” a third 
voice said. “When they walk right 
up to us and want to be friends 
with us it’s too much like plain 
murder, except that they can’t 
talk, and only make moronic sounds 
like ‘Bdl-bdl-bdl.’ Even so, it gets 
me when we kill them.” The others 
laughed. 

Suddenly Elf heard a new sound 
from the big It. It was not a voice 
sound, or if it was it was one that 
Elf felt he could not possibly match 
exactly. It was a growling, “RRrr- 
RRrrRRrr.” Suddenly it was re- 

ROG PHILLIPS 




placed by still a different sound, a 
“p-p-p-p-p” going very rapidly. 
Perhaps it was the way these crea- 
tures snored. It was not unpleasant. 
Elf cocked his head to one side, 
listening to the sound, smiling. 
How exciting it would be when he 
could join with these creatures! He 
wanted to so much. 

The big It began to move. In 
the first brief second Elf could not 
believe his senses. How could it 
move without being carried? But 
it was moving, and the creatures 
didn’t seem to be aware of it! Or 
perhaps they were too overcome by 
fear to leap out! 

Already the big It was moving 
faster than a walk, and was mov- 
ing faster with every heartbeat. 
How could they remain unaware 
of it and not leap to safety? 

Belatedly Elf abandoned caution 
and leaped down the embankment 
to the flat ribbon of rock, shouting. 
But already the big It was over a 
hundred yards away, and moving 
faster now than birds in flight! 

He shouted, but the creatures 
didn’t hear him — or perhaps they 
were so overcome with fright that 



they were frozen. Yes, that must 
be it. 

Elf ran after the big It. If he 
could only catch up with it he 
would gladly join the creatures in 
their fate. Better to die with them 
than to lose them! 

He ran and ran, refusing to be- 
lieve he could never overtake the 
big It, even when it disappeared 
from view, going faster than the 
wind. He ran and ran until his legs 
could lift no more. 

Blinded by tears, he tripped and 
sprawled full length on the wide 
ribbon of stone. His nose bled from 
hitting the hard surface. His knees 
were scraped and bleeding. He was 
unaware of this. 

He was aware only that the 
creatures were gone, to what un- 
imaginable fate he could not guess, 
but lost to him, perhaps forever. 

Sobs welled up within him, 
spilled out, shaking his small naked 
body. He cried as he hadn’t cried 
since he was a baby. 

And the empty Coca Cola bottle 
clutched forgotten in his hand 
glistened with the rays of the 
setting sun ... END

Maybe he was sick. No, that He looks deader than Einstein.” 
wasn’t it. Another muted cry of “I said grab his legs.”

A door shut. I went to the win- 
dow. I was shivering in the morning 
chill. A black car moved away 
down the broken pavement. It 
swerved to miss a large mudhole 
in the middle of the street and 
an old woman with burlap wrapped 
around her feet didn’t move fast 
enough. She flew across the side- 
walk like a ragged dummy and lay 
in a heap. 

Goodbye, Donnicker. I had seen 
the black car before. Donnicker 
was dead. But it didn’t bother me. 
I never had anything to do with 
neighbors, anybody I didn’t know 
had a top clearance. I was clear 
and intended to stay that way. 

You just never knew. Donnicker 
had seemed like a true patriot. My 
carefully distant and casual ob- 
servations of him had led me to 
believe he was as happily stupid 
as I was. But he had been hiding 
something. 

I turned from the window and 
started the day’s routine that had 
been the same for as long as I 
could remember. I warmed up 
some mush on the gas burner. At 
seven, as always, the Tevee warmed 
up, and Miss Info with the lac- 
quered lips smiled at me. “. and 
so don’t worry, citizens. The past 
is dead. The future is assured, and 
tomorrow will only be another to- 
day. And today we are safe and 
care-free.” 

Amen. She said it every morn- 
ing, but it was nice hearing it again. 
Then the news came on. There was 
a pile of junked tractors, trucks 
and harvesting machines, smashed 
and rusting. Then a line of farmers 
working with hoes and hand- 

64 



guided ploughs drawn by horses. 

“Machines took away sacred 
routine work from citizens. Egg- 
heads built the machines to 
rupt and spread the disease of 
reason. We are now replacing 
machines at the rate of a million 
a week. Soon, all of us will again 
be united in the happy harmonious 
brotherhood of labor. And when 
you see a rusting machine, what 
you are seeing is another captured 
Egghead, frothing and fuming in 
its cage . 

At a quarter to eight I walked 
ten blocks to work. There were the 
usual hectic early morning traffic 
jams. Wagon-loads of produce and 
half-starv^ horses blocking the 
streets. The same man was bating 
a nag with a board. A wagon piled 
with fruit and vegetables was stuck 
in a pot hole in the pavement. Two 
men were carrying a spinning wheel 
into the front of an apartment 
building. A peddler was selling oil 
lanterns, wicks and kerosene out 
of a barrel. The same women and 
boys in dirty sheepskin jackets were 
hauling rickshaws. 

I really didn’t see anyone or 
speak to anyone. I didn’t know any- 
one. I knew I was safe and had 
nothing to worry about. Once a 
week I used up my GI liquor chit 
at a bar with a Security seal on the 
window. Twice a week, I slept over 
at a GI brothel, where every girl 
had a Security clearance number 
tattoed on her thigh. 

I had nothing to worry about. 

I was passed through three gates 
by guards and went to my little 
cage inside Pentagon Circle, local 
headquarters of the Department of 

BRYCE WALTON 




Internal Security. 

Until that Tuesday morning I 
couldn’t remember ever having 
done anything but sort colored 
cards. My chief qualification for 
my job: I wasn’t color blind. When 
a green card with figures on it 
meaning nothing to me came out 
of a slot in the wall, I pushed it into 
a green slot that led somewhere into 
a filing department. When a red 
card came out, I pushed it into a 
red slot, and so forth. There were 
cards of fifteen colors. 

Another qualification: my un- 
conscious efficiency. I never had 
even a hint of an abstract thought. 
I never remembered yesterday, let 
alone the day before. And until 
that Tuesday morning I never made 
even a tiny mistake. 

I had no idea what I was doing. 
Nor was I at all curious. Curiosity 
was highly suspect. Curiosity was 
dangerous in the best of all possible 
worlds. It was ridiculous in a state 
where people had never had it so 
good. 

Cards sped from my hands al- 
ways into correct slots. Care-free 
hours slipped painlessly by into the 
dead past. I was sure I was safe 
and not thinking at all. I was a 
blessed blank. And then all at 
once — 

"'The eyes are the windows of 
the souV^ 

The thought meant nothing to 
me, except it was wrong, it didn’t 
belong in the routine. The routine 
flew to pieces. My efficiency blew 
up. I felt like a shiny bottle in a 
row of bottles with a sudden crack 
running down the middle. Red 
cards hit blue slots. Green cards 



hit yellow slots. Cards piled up, 
spilled over the floor. The more I 
tried to return to my efficiency, the 
worse everything was. 

My suit was wet with sweat. I 
thought of Mr. Donnicker. If a 
man’s routine broke, it could only 
be because some inner guilt was 
disrupting his harmony. A happy 
person is an efficient person. In- 
efficiency is the symptom of a guilty 
conscience. 

“Mr. Fredricks,” a voice whis- 
pered. “You’re replaced here.” 

A cold paralysis gripped me. 

“Get up, Fred.” 

I jumped out of my chair. A 
thin, stooped little man in a cheap 
gray suit and dull eyes took my 
place. In no tiipe at all he had 
straightened out my mess. Cards 
were blurs moving into the right 
slots. 

A wide, fattish man in a wrinkled 
dark suit was watching me out of 
curiously shining eyes. He carried 
a black briefcase. I had seen the 
black briefcases before. Special 
Police Agent. 

He opened the door of my cage 
and motioned for me to go out 
ahead of him. “Say goodbye to 
all this, Fred.” 

I felt the smile on my wet face 
as I nodded and tried to feel grate- 
ful while at the same time trying 
to suppress the flood of fear com- 
ing up through me and turning to 
sickness in my throat. 

I simply couldn’t be afraid. I 
had nothing to hide. And if I was 
hiding something inside me I didn’t 
know about, I should feel glad to 
have it detected and get it all 
cleaned out.

“My name is John Mesner,” he 
said as we walked down the cor- 
ridor. I couldn’t say anything. I 
felt like a string someone was be- 
ginning to saw on with a rusty 
knife. 

Mesner’s office somewhere up- 
stairs was a dingy room with a dusty 
desk and a couple of chairs. The 
walls were made of cracked con- 
crete lined with dusty filing cabi- 
nets. The window was so soiled I 
could barely see the shadows of 
bars through the panes. 

Mesner sat down, put his feet 
on the desk. He took an apple out 
of his desk drawer and started peel- 
ing it slowly with a small penknife. 

“You scared, Fred?” 

“Of course not.” 

He smiled, held out a long rib- 
bon of apple peel and dropped it 
on the floor. “You’re scared, Fred.” 

I put my Personology Card on 
his desk right in front of him. “I 
just had a quarterly brain-check a 
week ago. There it is.” 

I stopped myself somehow from 
yelling out wildly as he stabbed 
the card with his penknife, then 
tore it in little pieces and dropped 
them on the floor. 

“You’ve got nothing to be afraid 
of, Fred. But it’ll probably take 
you a while to realize it.” He went 
on peeling the apple. He had thick 
hands, stubby fingers, and the nails 
were dirty. He had a round pale 
face, a receding chin, thinning hair, 
and an absurd little red cupid 
bow mouth. 

I tried not to hear the moaning 
sound that seemed to come from the 
other side of a door to Mesner’s 
right. He got up, went to the door, 

66 



opened it. “Shut that guy up,” he 
said. He shut the door and sat 
down again. He sliced off a bite of 
apple and pushed it into his mouth. 

“To make it short, Fred. I’ve in- 
vestigated you thoroughly. And I 
can use you here in SPA. You’re 
being transferred.” 

My throat was constricted. I 
leaned against the desk. “I don’t 
understand, sir. I don’t know any- 
thing about Police Work. I’m only 
a clerk, a card-sorter. I don’t have 
any qualifications. And you can see 
— my card.” 

“A couple of field-trips with me, 
Fred, and you’ll be a veteran.” 
“But why me?” 

“You’re already in the Security 
Department for one thing. That 
makes it convenient. Also, your In- 
telligence Quotient.” 

“It’s a low eighty,” I said. “That’s 
the average. I’m well below nor- 
mal, and this brain-check showed 
I was lower this time than the last. 
So how could my IQ make any dif- 
ference?” 

“Curiosity killed the cat, Fred.” 
I managed to sit down before 
I fell down. It was impossible that 
I should really become an agent in 
the SP, the most powerful and 
feared organization in the state. 
What then w^as Mesner really up 
to? One work error shouldn’t have 
snagged me. I’d never been guilty 
of thinking above a rudimentary 
and socially acceptable level. My 
IQ was unquestionably low. I was 
little more than a moron. So why 
was I frightened. Why did I feel 
guilty? Why was Mesner interested? 

Mesner stood up and dropped 
the apple core on the floor. 



BRYCE WALTON 




“We’re going on a field-trip now, 
Fred. Your indoctrination as an 
SPA man is beginning.” 

Mesner piloted the heliocar. 
Mesner said the only heliocars left 
in operation belonged to SPA. He 
dropped it on a plot of dried grass 
on the side of a forested hill in the 
Tennessee Mountains. Until we 
got out of the heliocar, I didn’t 
know Mesner had a gun. I couldn’t 
remember having heard of a gun 
or seen one before, but Mesner told 
me all about guns. He slid the 
rifle out of a canvas case, checked 
it, called it his favorite little field 
piece. Then he handed me his black 
briefcase. 

He led the way down a narrow 
path. It was a quiet sunny day. 
Squirrels ran between the trees. 
Birds hopped and sang up in the 
leaves. 

In front of a gray, dilapidated 
shack was a rickety wagon. Two 
men were lifting a sack out of the 
rear of the wagon. They wore rag- 
ged overalls and no shirts and they 
were both barefoot. 

Mesner yelled. “You. Dirksons! 
This is a security check.” 

The shorter one started to run. 
Mesner shot him in the back of 
the head. The tall man grabbed 
up a piece of iron with a hooked 
end and started yelling as he ran 
toward us. 

“Open the briefcase,” Mesner 
said oilmly. 

I opened it. Mesner leaned the 
rifle against a tree. He knelt down, 
brought a metal disc out of the 
briefcase attached to a wire. He 
turned a dial on a bank of controls 



inside the case. I heard a whirring 
hum. The tall hillbilly screamed. 
He stretched up on his toes, 
strained his arms and neck at the 
sky, then fell twitching on his face. 

Mesner walked toward the hill- 
billy and I stumbled after him. I 
was going to be sick, very sick. The 
sun worked like pins in my eye- 
balls. 

Mesner drew a round metal cap 
which he called a stroboscope from 
the case, fitted it on the hillbilly’s 
head. The metal strip had a disc 
hanging down in front of the hill- 
billy’s eyes and about two inches 
away. 

Mesner worked the dials and the 
flicker began blinking off and on, 
faster and faster, then slower, then 
faster again as the hillbilly’s eyes 
stared into it unblinkingly. His 
muscles began to twitch. He beat 
the ground with his flat hands. 
Grasshoppers jumped across his 
face. 

Mesner pointed out to me that 
I was watching an on-the-spot 
brain-probe. The brain-prober, or 
bipper, as Mesner called it, was so 
effective he hardly ever had to use 
the other items in the case such as 
the psychopharmaceuticals, drugs, 
brain shock gadgets, extractors, 
nerve stretchers and the like. 

Mesner sat on his haunches, 
worked the flicker and lit a ciga- 
rette. “These brain-wave flickers 
correspond to any desired brain- 
wave rhythm. You play around and 
you’ll get the one you want. They 
talk. What they don’t say comes 
out later from the recorder. With 
this bipper you can get anything 
out of anyone, almost. If you don’t

get the info you want it’s only be- 
cause they don’t have it. It bums 
them out considerably in the proc- 
ess, but that’s all to the good. 
They’re erased, and won’t do any 
meddlesome thinking again.” 

The hillbilly wasn’t moving now 
as the flicker worked on his eyes 
and activated desired mental re- 
sponses. 

“Dirkson,” Mesner said. “What 
happened to your sister, Elsa?” 
“Don’t know. She runned away.” 
“She was blind wasn’t she? 
Wasn’t she bom blind?” 

I felt an icy twist in my stomach. 
“That’s right. Homed blind as 
a bat.” 

“What happened to her?” 
“Runned away with some river 
rat.” 

“You’ve hidden her somewhere, 
Dirkson. Where?” 

“I ain’t hid her nowhere.” 
Mesner turned a dial. The hill- 
billy screamed. His body bent up- 
ward. Blood ran out of his mouth. 
He was chewing his tongue, Mesner 
stood up and frowned. “Guess he 
didn’t know. If he knew he’d have 
told us. He’s no disguised Egghead. 
Just a damn collaborating, bottle- 
headed jerk.” 

I went over behind some bmsh 
and was sick. The hillbilly would 
never answer any more questions, 
I knew that much. Now he was 
laughing and babbling and crawl- 
ing around on his hands and knees. 

“It’s rough at first, Fred. No 
matter how patriotic you are, and 
how much you hate Eggheads, it’s 
always rough at first. But you 
should get used to it.” 

“What — I mean why — ?” 

68 



“The Dirksons didn’t show for 
their quarterly brain-check. You 
assume they’re hiding something. 
It turns out they’re not, then you 
haven’t lost an^^hing. Of course 
you have to bum them out a little 
to question them. But better to 
bum one innocent bottlehead than 
let one double-dome slip away.” 
Mesner turned and lookrf at me. 
“Isn’t that right, Fred?” 

“Of course it’s right,” I said 
quickly. Mesner smiled at me. 

N THE WAY back to Wash- 
ington, Mesner piloted the 
heliocar casually. He leaned back, 
smoking cigarettes, the ashes 
streaming down the front of his 
soiled lapels. 

“I think you’ll work out fine in 
SPA, Fred.” 

I was still sick. I had a throbbing 
ache in my head and sweat kept 
stinging in my eyes. I nodded 
numbed agreement with Mesner. 

“I appreciate your trying to make 
an SPA man out of me,” I finally 
managed to say. “But could you 
have made some mistake? Gotten 
the wrong file or something?” 

“No. Your IQ is a nice low 
eighty, Fred. But you’re just not 
aware that you have what is techni- 
cally known as a quiescent IQ.” 

“What’s that?” 

“You’re a true patriot, Fred. We 
both know that. So don’t be scared. 
You know the sick and evil danger 
of a high IQ and so you’ve put an 
unconscious damf>er on your own 
intelligence. You’re not really so 
dumb, Fred.” 

“But I am,” I said quickly. 

BRYCE WALTON 





“No, Fred. You think you are, 
and you look and act normally 
stupid and believe me, Fred, I 
admire your patriotic suppression 
of your intelligence, even from your- 
self. But a fact is a fact, and you’re 
not so dumb.” 

“I’m not pretending. I’m not a 
a subversive — 

“Easy now,” Mesner said. 
“You’re not a subversive, that’s 
right. A real subversive knows he’s 
smart, is proud of it and conscious- 
ly tries to hide it from others. But 
you loathe your own inherent 
mental ability, and you’ve been 
able to freeze its operation, conceal 
it even from yourself. Now realize 
this, Fred. The only place we can 
allow intelligence to operate is in- 
side the Government. The Govern- 
ment must have a slightly superior 
thinking capacity in order to run 
things — for the present anyway.” 

“But any IQ above eighty is sub- 
versive. It says in the — ” 

“That’s an ideal, a goal for the 
future, Fred. When the transition’s 
been made, when the last Egg- 
head is captured and put away, 
then all of us will be normal. We’ll 
get ourselves bipped, and bum our 
excessive intelligence down to the 
eighty mark. But until that time, 
Fred, some of us — especially the 
SPA — have to keep our wits about 
us. An unfortunate necessity that 
we pray will soon be ended.” 

I gazed numbly out through the 
plastic canopy at the white clouds 
streaming past. He was trying to 
get some admission out of me, I 
thought. That was the only ex- 
planation. Working some subtle 
game with me. But that was absurd 

DARK WINDOWS 



on its face, because I was way below 
normal. 

“My IQ’s no good for you then,” 
I said. “I just don’t see — ” 

Mesner interrupted with an im- 
patient laugh. “You’re a hell of a 
lot brighter than you let yourself 
admit that you are, Fred. That’s 
all I’m saying. You know it’s a 
terrible thing to be smart, so you 
keep it under wraps. But now you 
know there’s nothing to be afraid 
of. You know it’s legal for a while 
longer to be smart as long as you’re 
in SPA. Now you can start open- 
ing up, releasing your mental capac- 
ity. Believe me, Fred, it’s for the 
good of the state. I know it sounds 
like a paradox, but that’s how it is.” 

“How can it be good when it’s 
such an evil thing?” 

“Because right now it’s a neces- 
sary evil. SPA has problems, Fred. 
There are still a lot of Eggheads 
mnning loose, causing trouble. 
And the doubledomes still loose 
are the toughest ones to catch, and 
that’s our job. We’ve got to track 
down the old maniac physicists, 
chemists, engineers, professors, 
psyche-boys and the like who are 
still working underground. Until 
they’re all caught Fred, we’ve got 
to live with our own filthy brains. 
Because you see it takes brains to 
catch brains.” 

“But I have hardly any brains at 
all,” I insisted. 

“You’ll see, Fred. You’ll see.” 

Before I left his office that eve- 
ning he gave me an SPA identity 
card. My name and face were on 
it. Suddenly it seemed impossibly 
official. All at once, I was one of 

69 




the most feared and powerful men 
in the State. Only I knew that the 
only one I really feared was me. 

That card supposedly gave me 
a free hand. It could take me any- 
where, even into top-secret de- 
partments in Security. With it, I 
was immune to curfew laws, to all 
social restrictions and regulations. 
But when I went for a walk that 
evening, I knew I was being fol- 
lowed. Wherever I went, eyes 
watched me constantly. Shadows 
moved in and out of gray doorways 
and dissolved around comers. 

After nine, after the curfew 
sirens howled down the emptied 
streets, I walked fast toward the 
ancient rooming house in which I 
thought I had always lived. Hun- 
dreds of silent gray women and 
children came out onto the streets 
and began cleaning them with 
brooms. One by one, the gas lights 
along the rubbled streets went out. 
I started to run through shadows, 
and footsteps moved behind me. 

A dmnken man came out of an 
alley and staggered down the 
broken pavement where weeds 
grew. A black car whisked him 
away. But no black car stopped for 
me. I saw no one with a black 
briefcase either. I saw only shadows, 
and felt unseen eyes watcliing me. 

The old woman who had been 
run down by a black car still lay 
there on the sidewalk. No one dared 
approach that corpse to get it off 
the streets. No one knew who it 
was, or why it was dead. No one 
would take any chances. One was 
just as suspect from associating 
with a guilty corpse as a living 
neighbor named Donnicker. 

70 



Upstairs, I saw a splotch of blood 
on the hall floor. This time I knew 
it was Donnicker’s. It reminded me 
of the Dirksons now. And of who 
could say how many others? 

I lay down and took all three of 
tomorrow’s tranquitabs. We were 
allotted a month’s supply of tran- 
quitabs at a time, and we were 
all compelled by law to take three 
a day. They knocked out worry and 
anxiety usually. But now they didn’t 
seem to do me much good. I 
couldn’t seem to go to sleep. This 
had never happened to me before. 

Maybe Mesner was right. May- 
be I did have a high IQ but 
wasn’t consciously aware of it. This 
being true, then I had to be in 
SPA. SPA was the only place a 
high IQ could be tolerated. 

What really bothered me the 
most, of course, was why I should 
be worried about anything. If my 
IQ was useful, I ought to be glad 
of it. A true patriot should be glad 
also to have unconscious subversive 
elements detected. A true patriot 
would be grateful for whatever 
treatment could cleanse him. What 
was the matter with me? Didn’t 
I want to be purified, cleansed? 
Didn’t I want to be bipped a little? 

I didn’t trust Mesner. I didn’t 
believe he really wanted me to help 
him track down Eggheads. But 
so what? If he was trying to find 
out something about me, I ought 
to be glad to cooperate. 

Only I wasn’t. 

I had bad dreams. I dreamed of 
Dirkson babbling and crawling and 
smiling at me with his bloody 
mouth. He kept smiling and whis- 
pering to me: “I never did know 

BRYCE WALTON 




nothing, and now I’m just all 
burned out.” 

I dreamed of old man Donnicker 
being dragged down the stairs. 

Then I dreamed that Mesner 
came in and looked down at me 
sleeping. A light bulb came down 
from the ceiling. It turned bright, 
then dull, then bright, then dull. 

Mesner smiled as he lit a ciga- 
rette. “That really bothered you 
didn’t it, Fred. Bipping the Dirk- 
son boy.” 

“It made me sick.” 

I wanted to wake up. I tried my 
best to wake up because I felt that 
if I didn’t wake up now, I never 
would. I would die in my sleep. 

“Let’s talk about it, Fred. I’m 
uneasy about it myself sometimes. 
I’ve bipped so many of them, may- 
be my conscience bothers me. You 
think it might bother a man’s 
conscience, Fred?” 

“What do you mean, con- 
science?” 

“Maybe you think there’s some- 
thing immoral about bipping a 
man.” 

“If the State does it, it’s right,” 
I said. “If it helps bring about the 
Era of Normalcy and absolute and 
permanent stability, then any 
method is right.” 

Was that the correct answer? 
I was beginning to feel confused. 
Thoughts, words all jumbling up. 
There was an orthodox thought 
and an orthodox answer for every- 
thing. I’d learned them all. But 
had I answered this one correctly? 

“That’s right, Fred. But the old 
crackpot Egghead moralists used to 
say that the end doesn’t necessarily 
justify the means. They would 

DARK WINDOWS 



claim that bipping a man was 
wrong, and that no good results 
could ever come from it. They 
would say that a destructive means 
would always create a destructive 
end. Violence, they said, could only 
create more violence. What do you 
think of that, Fred?” 

“That’s wrong,” I said. “That’s 
confusing, double-dome stuff.” 

“I know. But we’ve got to iden- 
tify with Egghead thinking if we 
can. No matter how repulsive it is, 
we’ve got to understand how they 
think rf we’re going to track them 
down and put them away. Now 
think hard, Fred. Have you ever 
heard a man say, ‘Better that the 
whole world should die than that 
one man’s brain should be invaded 
against his will.’ ” 

“No, no, that’s subversive,” I 
screamed. 

There was more dream, more 
questions, more and more confused 
answers. I woke up in a cold sweat. 
I found several electronic spyeyes 
concealed about the room. Just out- 
side my door I saw one of Mesner’s 
cigarette butts. It was yellowed with 
spittle, twisted and pinched in the 
way his always were. 

I didn’t know if all of that night, 
or only part of it had been a dream. 
I didn’t know if Mesner had actu- 
ally been questioning me in my 
sleep or not. The spy-eyes could do 
that. But I knew Mesner had been 
outside my door. Probably he had 
been questioning my dreams. 



T hat day was worse than the 
night. Mesner had said to wait 
until I heard from him, but there 

71 




' was no word from him that day. I 
tried more tranquitabs. The hell 
with tomorrow’s supply. They 
didn’t help me. A blinding head- 
ache hit me at regular intervals. 

What was Mesner using me for? 
What did he want from me? What 
was I supposed to know? 

The Educational Tevee came on 
also at regular intervals. 

“. so if you might think, 
Citizens, that a machine could do 
your simple work better, just re- 
member what a terrible thing the 
machines did to us during the 
cataclysmic age of reason. As you 
know, the machines were invented 
to replace human labor by Egg- 
heads who have always tried to 
destroy normal, comfortable and 
simple ways of life. The disease of 
free-thought was only possible after 
the machines replaced human 
beings, gave us the time to develop 
excessive and self-destructive think- 
ing ...” 

I watched the light outside my 
window turn a duller gray then 
black, and after that an edge of 
white moon slid partly across the 
pane. 

Why should I care what Mesner 
was trying to get out of me? If it 
was subversive then I should be 
glad to get rid of it. If I was clear 
and clean, then I had nothing to 
worry about. Why wasn’t I simply 
hipped like Donnicker and Dirkson 
had been? Why should a true pa- 
triot care? 

I shivered and stared into the 
darkness. Something horrible had 
happened to me. For the first time 
I realized I was entertaining un- 
patriotic thoughts. I didn’t want to 

72 



be hipped. And I knew that when 
Mesner finished with me, I would 
be hipped. When he found out 
whatever I was supposed to know, 
I’d join Dirkson and the rest of 
them. It had been all right, going 
along with the routines, as long as 1 
actually hadn’t seen what hap- 
pened to a man if he didn’t. 

I didn’t want to be erased. 
Whatever I was, I suddenly wanted 
to stay me, guilty or not. Maybe 
this attitude was all that Mesner 
wanted to be sure of. But I doubted 
it. Because a simple hipping would 
have determined that. 

I didn’t think I could stomach 
any more of Mesner’s field-trips. 
On the other hand I had to go 
along. It all seemed to boil down to 
whether I wanted to get bipped 
now or later. 

“Bipping isn’t bad at all,” Mes- 
ner had said yesterday. “After 
you’re bipped, you can do routine 
work like everyone else, never 
worry again about worrying. That 
guy who replaced you, for example. 
He was bipp>ed. He’s never made a 
mistake for 20 years. He never 
will.” 

I closed ihy eyes. I thought of 
all the happy bottleheads walking 
the streets, out on the farms, doing 
their routine work, happy and care- 
free as long as they didn’t worry. 
Human vegetables, the erased ones, 
and the terrified ones who didn’t 
know they were even scared. Cities 
full of dull-eyed ciphers, and now 
that I was outside it a little, I 
could see them with an awful clar- 
ity. 

And I thought — how many are 
as dumb as they appear to be? 



BRYCE WALTON 




How many were just too frightened 
and numbed to think? How many 
would stay frightened and numb so 
long that they would never be able 
to think even if they sometime de- 
cided to try? 

It was easy enough to assume that 
too much intelligence was an evil, 
a virus to be burned out. Was it 
better to have too little and be- 
come like the hillbilly? 

Oh, Mesner had set my so-called 
quiescent IQ going all right. But 
how far would it go before it had 
gone far enough for his purpose? 

HAT NIGHT I had another 
bad dream. Only it didn’t really 
seem so bad as it should have been. 
A blind man was talking to me. 
Then I dreamed that a blind girl 
with a seeing-eye dog was looking 
at me. She was about fifteen, may- 
be younger, dressed in a plain 
flowered dress tied in back with a 
ribbon. She had a soft round face 
and her eyes were wide and opaque. 
The girl and dog seemed to come 
out of a mist and they whispered 
to me. It was frightening, but im- 
portant, and I didn’t remember 
what it was. 

I woke up shivering. I seemed to 
smell wet hair, and the window 
was open. I couldn’t remember 
whether I had shut the window be- 
fore I went to sleep or not. 

Mesner called me early the next 
morning. 

He looked the same in his 
wrinkled suit with the food stains 
on the lapels, and peeling an apple. 

“Fred, have you ever heard a 
phrase sounding like . and the 

DARK WINDOWS 



blind shall lead them?’ ” 

I appeared to be trying to think 
about it, then said I had never 
heard anything like that. 

“You’re jx)sitive about that?” 
“I don’t remember it.” 

“You mean you might have, but 
you just can’t remember it.” 

“I didn’t say that. I doubt if I 
ever heard such a phrase.” 

“What about this one, . and 
the blind shall see again,’ ” 

“No, I said. 

“You’re sure?” 

I looked directly at him and he 
stopped peeling the apple. “If I’m 
supposed to have such a damn 
high quiescent IQ, why not let me 
in on a few things?” 

“What few things?” 

“These references to the blind. 
The Dirksons. Some blind girl 
named Elsa. What are you try- 
ing to find out?” 

“I thought maybe you remem- 
bered something, that’s all. I’m 
pretty much in the dark myself. 
All I have are a few clues and 
theories.” 

“Clues, theories, about what?” 
“Eggheads. Sabotage. What the 
crackpots could build, they can 
best destroy. They’re blowing up 
factories, manufacturing and power 
plants, machines, production.” 
“That’s sabotage? I thought the 
whole idea in bringing about the 
Era of Normalcy was to do away 
with all mechanization. Do every- 
thing with the hands, like in the 
good old days.” 

“That’s an ultimate goal, Fred. 
Drudges don’t think. They’re hap- 
pier. But the transition has to be 
more gradual. The Eggheads want 

73 





to take away all mechanization at 
once, create chaos and anarchy. 
They figure that will cause the bot- 
tleheads to revolt against the 
Government. We can’t catch the 
saboteurs. The saboteurs inside a 
blown-up factory, for example, we 
never know who they are. We bip 
every worker, not a sign of a sabo- 
teur. So whoever does the dirty 
work is a mindless tool of the Egg- 
head underground, having no mem- 
ory of having committed sabotage. 
Who are the couriers, the ones 
who make vital contact between 
the Egghead underground and the 
saboteurs? The dumb saboteur 
has to get his highly complex di- 
rectives from the Eggheads. Who 
are the couriers?” 

“Why ask me?” 

“I know this much, Fred. Blind 
people are used as couriers.” 

My knees felt weak. I couldn’t 
say anything. All I could think 
about was my dreams. 

“I want to show you something, 
Fred.” Mesner led me through the 
other door. A bleak concrete cu- 
bicle, no windows, a damp walled 
gray cell. Two naked men lay on 
slabs. Stroboscopes on their h^ds. 
Behind them, styluses recorded 
brain-wave p>atterns on moving 
white strips. One of the men, the 
one on the left, was blind. His eyes 
staring up into the flicker were 
opaque. 

“Look at those brain-wave re- 
cordings, Fred. They’re getting the 
same stimulus. We can give a 
thousand bottleheads this stimulus 
with the flicker, and get identical 
responses. But not the blind boys. 
We can’t successfully bip a blind 



boy. The brain-waves are radically 
different and we’ve never figured 
out a way of codifying them. A 
blind bastard’s never seen any- 
thing. The seeing eyes are trackers, 
like radar. But a blind boy takes 
in reality and records it and keeps 
it in a different way. We can’t get 
at the code easily. But I’m getting 
it. I’ve bipped plenty of blind boys 
and I’m getting it, Fred. The blind 
are used for couriers. I know that 
much. For the simple reason that 
we can’t bip meaningful info out 
of their scrambled think-tanks.” 

The naked men on the slabs 
moaned. One of them opened his 
mouth and a bloody foam spread 
over his chin. 

“What I’m looking for now is a 
known courier who is also blind. 
Then I can bip him, and check 
the info with the code I’ve worked 
out.” 

He unbuttoned his coat and took 
a black hand-gun out of a holster 
strapped beneath his arm. “Mean- 
while, Fred, these bottleheads have 
had it. They’re burned out.” 

I heard the two sharp echoing 
reports as Mesner shot them in the 
head. One of them beat his heels 
on the slab. Mesner pointed the 
smoking revolver. “Even dead, the 
blind brain records differently. See 
there?” 

I leaned against the wall. 
Through a crumbled hole down in 
the corner of damp concrete, I 
saw two red eyes and heard the 
rat squealing. 

“Let’s go, Fred. We’ve got some 
important field-trips on today’s 
schedule. And you still have a lot 
to learn.” 



74 



BRYCE WALTON 




We went to Chicago. We set up 
some hidden electronic spy-eyes in 
a big apartment building. They 
were to be checked later for evi- 
dence of someone there who was 
hiding an IQ of over a hundred. 

And that afternoon we ran 
down a renegade bio-chemist hid- 
ing in a tenement. He had disguised 
himself for a number of years as 
a plumber. Mesner bipped him, 
and an official Security heliocar 
came down from Washington to 
take him away. 

When Mesner finished with the 
old man he was hopping around 
like a monkey, making grotesque 
faces, giggling and yelling. Tevee 
cameramen were on hand. A re- 
porter was commenting on the 
capture of another, “. insane 
crackpot who has been living here 
under an assumed name while 
plotting and planning and building 
some diabolical machine with which 
to blow up the city. Our depart- 
ment of Internal Security excer- 
cising its eternal vigilance, cap- 
tured him in time . .” 

Mesner and I took the heliocar 
back up into a clear blue sky and 
headed for Sauk City. 

“Do you wonder, Fred, why we 
just don’t kill them after they’re 
bipped?” 

“What could it matter?” 

“It doesn’t to them, but to us it 
matters. Public likes their scape- 
goats alive. More satisfying to hate 
live people. Public likes to see their 
dragons behind bars, humiliated, 
treated like crackpots. Makes a 
bottlehead feel ^d to see an Egg- 
head dancing like a monkey. Also 
prevents martyrs. Living men are 

DARK WINDOWS 



never martyrs.” ‘ 

“So why are we going to Sauk 
City?” I asked. I wanted to change 
the subject. 

Mesner had information that an 
ex-professor from some long-ex- 
tinct University had been conceal- 
ing a high IQ after having sup- 
posedly purged himself of it years 
before. He was supposed to have 
been caught by a brain-probing 
spy-eye and was reported to have 
an IQ of over 160. 

Mesner talked of such an IQ as 
though it was a living time-bomb 
that might go off any minute and 
blow Sauk City and the entire 
State to hell. He shot the heliocar 
along at 500 miles an hour. He held 
the T-Bar in one hand and lit cig- 
arettes with the other. 

“What upset you so much, Fred? 
I mean that morning when I in- 
terrupted you sorting cards?” 

I felt a warning click in my head. 
I remembered it. The eyes are the 
windows of the soul. 

Mesner, I thought, couldn’t look 
into the windows of a blind man. 
Could I? 

It hadn’t been my own thought 
that had disrupted my idyllic, care- 
free life sorting cards. Mesner had 
said it to me. 

“Just the unexpected break in 
the routine,” I said. “You’ve al- 
ready explained it. My quiescent 
IQ is just too high to be a suc- 
cessful card-sorter.” 

“It wasn’t what I said?” 

“What did you say? I’ve for- 
gotten.” 

“The eyes are the windows of the 
soul. But I was only quoting, Fred. 
Some crackpot said that long ago.” 

75 




“Why probe me about blind 
people? I never knew any.” 

“Ninety percent of a human 
being’s mental activity is under- 
ground, like most of an iceberg is 
under water. How much of your 
past can you remember, Fred?” 
“Very little. The past is dead. 
Why should I remember it?” 
“Because a good intelligence de- 
pends on the past. Memory is a part 
of it. Without a past, you don’t 
have a brain. And we’ve got to re- 
lease our brains, Fred, for awhile. 
Until we can catch saboteurs and 
Eggheads.” 

“I guess I’ve just been a patriot 
too long,” I said. 

“Remember attending Drake 
University ten years ago, Fred?” 
“Sure,” I said, fast, as though it 
was unimportant. I was really be- 
ginning to sweat. “I can remember 
if you keep prodding me. Sure, I 
can. So what? I purged myself. I 
forgot it. Schools weren’t illegal 
then.” 

“But we’ve got to reawaken all 
those past memories, Fred. Make 
our brains work better, even if a 
lot of doubledome stuff comes up. 
You remember a psyche prof named 
O’Hara?” 

I felt suddenly dizzy, sick. A 
wavering wheel started turning in 
my head. I managed to stop it from 
turning so fast. “I don’t remem- 
ber that at all,” I said. 

“Then of course you wouldn’t 
remember that he was blind?” 

In the darkness behind closed 
lids I could see patterns of light 
begin to flicker and threatening 
whispers dug at a fogging curtain. 
“Don’t push it, Fred. It’ll come. 

76 



I’m patient. If I weren’t, then by 
this time I would be bipped myself 
and safely put away.” 

He would get it all right, I 
knew. Sooner or later he would tap 
it. First I would tap it, then Mes- 
ner would tap it. And after that I 
never would worry again. I’d 
never worry about remembering or 
forgetting anything. I wouldn’t 
even be me. A body with a bipped 
brain would walk around doing 
routine work, and looking like me. 
But I’d be dead. I didn’t want to 
die that way. Genuine physical 
death would be all right. But not 
that, not that hipping treatment. 

Mesner turned quickly and 
caught me staring at the outline of 
the handgun under his coat. He 
smiled. “You want one of these, 
Fred?” 

“Not yet,” I said. “I don’t re- 
member enough yet. I’m not smart 
enough yet.” 

“Tell me when you’re ready.” 

By the time we closed in on the 
professor in an old deserted house 
on the outskirts of Sauk City, he 
had managed to hang himself to a 
waterpipe in the basement. He 
wore a pair of ragged pants. He 
was terribly thin and his hair was 
white, and his toothless mouth 
gaped open and his jaws sucked in. 
I had never seen anyone appear so 
pitiful and so harmless as that old 
man hanging there. 

We untied the rope and the body 
fell to the floor. Mesner took a 
small disc from his case and put it 
over the dead man’s heart, then 
stood up. “He’s too dead. We 
should have gotten here a few min- 

BRYCE WALTON 




utes earlier.” 

He seemed tired as he sat down 
on a soggy box. His hands were 
dirty with coal dust and a smudge 
of it was on his face. 

This is it, I thought. Now was as 
good a time for it as any, because 
there wasn’t any good time for it. 
He had all the advantage. And the 
longer it went on, the greater ad- 
vantage he would have. It was only 
a question of time anyway, and I 
couldn’t stand waiting. 

I lunged at him. I heard the 
faint whining sound, saw the flash 
and the glint of the disc coming out 
of his pocket. A sudden, painless 
paralysis hit me and I was helpless 
on my knees looking at Mesner. He 
just stared at me morosely, tired, 
irritated a little. 

“You should know better, Fred. 
You’re smart.” 

“Go to hell,” I said. 

He shook his head. “Not now, 
Fred. Nor you either. It isn’t me 
you want to get, Fred. You just 
don’t want to get hipped. You 
ought to trust me. I don’t want to 
bip you, now or ever. I mean it. We 
need brains to catch Eggheads and 
that’s my job. You’re valuable. 
Everybody getting hipped, it isn’t 
easy to get smart people these days.” 
“Bip me now then, you bastard. 
Get it over with.” 

“You’d better trust me. I’m be- 
ing honest. Some of these other 
oi&odox jerks in Security, they 
wouldn’t fool with you. They 
would bip you sooner than look at 
you.” 

“Why don’t you?” 

“I’ve told you, for God’s sake. 
You’re a bright guy, and I’m 

DARK WINDOWS 



eager to learn. And I don’t want to 
burn up any important info.” 

Then I got it. Then I knew why 
he was keeping the bipper off me. 

I thought about it all the way 
back to Washington while Mesner 
fed himself apples. I was supposed 
to have valuable unconscious info. 
Mesner wanted it. But the old 
crackpots were right. The means 
not only created the ends, but could 
destroy the ends if the means were 
bad enough. You probe and pry 
into a man’s brain deep and hard 
enough and you come up with 
nothing. Your methods have de- 
stroyed the end. You’ve burned out 
the truth you’re trying to get. 

Mesner was trying to get info 
from me without burning it up. 

The bastard was trying to have 
his bloody cake and eat it. But the 
insight didn’t make my position any 
easier. He was going to get it some 
way. His talking and hinting and 
probing was designed to awaken 
vital memory in me, get it up into 
total consciousness where he could 
get at it with his instruments with- 
out the danger of burning it up. 

Soon as he got what he wanted 
he would bip me. I couldn’t keep 
him from getting it because I didn’t 
know what it was. I couldn’t keep 
on suppressing something if I 
didn’t know what it was, and I 
knew that no one can consciously 
suppress knowledge in himself in 
any case. 



F or two more days I didn’t 

hear from Mesner. I indulged 
in feverish and ridiculous escape 
fantasies. There could be no escape 

77 




for me. The educational voices 
from the Tevee drifted in and out. 

. the greatest threat to man’s 
happy survival is reason. Man was 
never intended to go above a cer- 
tain mental level and become there- 
by a victim of his own imagination 
and complex fears. This disease of 
reason has been carried to its final 
suicidal limit by Eggheads . .” 

No mention of sabotage. The 
care-free public must not hear of 
such disquieting things. All the 
public heard 24 hours a day was a 
voice telling them about the evils 
of reason. The destructiveness of 
overly-developed brains, and the 
vicious criminality of Eggheads. 

After listening to that long 
enough, and having all subversive 
level IQs purged, who could be- 
lieve otherwise? How many be- 
lieved otherwise now? Did I? What 
in hell did Mesner want to dig out 
of me? Who, what, why was I? 

I was still a bottle. But now 
there were countless cracks appear- 
ing in it. 

Then Mesner called, said we 
were going on another field-trip 
that next afternoon. All right, I 
said. Someway or other, I knew, 
I would make this my last trip with 
Mesner. 

He had located a blind man, he 
said, who he knew had been a 
courier, a blind man definitely 
linked up with a recent sabotaging 
of a motor parts plant somewhere 
in Illinois. 

Mesner looked down on the 
shanty town from a high bluff 
above the river. The river rats’ 
shanties were built half in, half out 



of the water, some of them on 
stilts, some of them actually con- 
sisting of dilapidated houseboats. 

Mesner said river rats were 
worse rebs even than hillbillies. 
They drifted up and down the 
rivers. You staged a raid and they 
dissolved away into the river like 
rodents. Many of them skipped 
quarterly brain-checks, but no one 
knew how many. Birth and death 
records weren’t kept by river rats. 

I walked ahead of Mesner down 
a winding gravel path into rotting 
reeds by the river, then we fol- 
lowed another muddy path toward 
the shanties. Frogs and insects 
hummed. A path of moonlight 
moved across the water. A ribby 
hound dog slunk away from me. A 
ragged kid looking wilder than the 
hound, ran across the path and 
slipped soundlessly into the muddy 
water. 

Mesner pointed out the blind 
man’s shack. Then he looked at 
me and smiled with that absurd 
little cupid bow mouth. “This isn’t 
the time either, Fred. If you think 
we’re not covered, you’re wrong. 
You couldn’t run fifty feet before 
they burned you down.” 

We walked nearer the loosely 
boarded and sagging shack. 

“You take the back, Fred. Just 
remember, better later than now. 
And be careful. When these river 
rats get stirred up, they can cause 
a hell of a row. The entire goon 
squad would have to move in and 
there would be a mass hipping 
spree.” 

Mesner crept nearer, then whis- 
pered. “No light. You can’t even 
tell if one of them’s at home after 



78 



BRYCE WALTON 




dark. Why do they need a light? 
Go on, watch the back door, Fred. 
And don’t let this one slip by.” 

I heard the front door crash in- 
ward. A man wearing only tattered 
pants ran out. He was thin and 
ribby like the dog, and I could see 
the moonlight shining on the 
opaque whiteness of his eyes. 

He ran directly at me. And I 
knew I wasn’t going to try to stop 
him. But I didn’t know why. Then 
Mesner came out and fired a small 
gun, smaller than the one under 
his coat. It wasn’t the same. This 
was a nerve-gun and it curled the 
synaptic connections between neu- 
rons. 

The blind man collapsed and lay 
like a corpse at my feet. I knelt 
down and felt of him. Mesner whis- 
pered for me to drag the old man 
inside. I hooked my hands under 
his shoulders and pulled him into 
the shack. It didn’t matter to me 
now, nor to the blind man, I 
thought. 

He hardly weighed anything. His 
eyes were fixed in a white silence as 
Mesner shone a small flashlight into 
them. Then Mesner shut both 
doors and pulled a ragged cloth 
across the single window. 

He opened his case. He put the 
stroboscope on the blind man’s 
head. The bluish light began to 
flicker over the staring opaque eyes. 
I saw the nerve-gun lying on the 
floor beside Mesner’s hand. 

“You’re too late,” I said. “He’s 
dead. I wouldn’t have dragged him 
in here if I hadn’t known he was 
dead.” 

Mesner was breathing thickly. 
His fat round face was pale and 



shiny with sweat. “I know he’s 
dead. He must have gulped a fast- 
action poison soon as I came in the 
door. Maybe even the blind boys 
are deciding things are getting too 
hot.” 

Mesner worked the stroboscope. 

“But he’s dead,” I said. 

“Brain cells are the last to die,” 
Mesner said. “Maybe I can pick 
up a little info yet.” 

It burst out of me then as from 
an abscess. The bottle cracked into 
a thousand fragments. I lunged at 
Mesner. He seemed to roll away 
from me, and then he squatted 
there in the flickering light. He 
leveled the gun at me. 

“So you’re beginning to wake up, 
Fred!” 

Probing a dead man. Question- 
ing the dead. Even a corpse was 
sacred no longer. The vile and hor- 
rible bastards, all of them. 

“I don’t care what happens to 
me,” I said. 

“That’s noble of you.” 

“I’m going to kill you.” 

“Why?” 

“You wouldn’t understand.” 

“Maybe I wouldn’t agree, but I’ll 
understand, Fred. I know what 
you’re thinking. What I’m doing 
now is just too much. Right? The 
final indignity one human being 
could inflict on another, right? A 
human mind should be sacred, even 
if it’s dumb. Even if it’s dead. Es- 
pecially if it’s dead. Right, Fred?” 

I started around the rickety table 
toward him. 

“Now it’s set off, Fred. You’re 
fired up now. That’s what I’ve 
been waiting for. You were planted 
to sabotage Security itself, Fred, 



DARK WINDOWS 



79 




and I always knew that. Now 
we’re going to find out all the rest 
of it. Now it’s squeezing out of your 
unconscious, and we can drain it, 
empty it all out. They put a lid on 
your mind, Fred, and I’ve taken it 
off. Put on the ethical pressure, put 
it heavy on your idealistic Egghead 
morality, steam it up hot, blow the 
lid off. It’s working, Fred.” 

“Is it?” I said. “I don’t remem- 
ber anything that would do you 
any good. I just know that it’s 
wrong, the final horrible fraud. It 
isn’t intelligence you guys want to 
wipe out, Mesner. Not your own, 
not the big wheels in power. It’s 
only certain kinds of thinking, un- 
desirable thoughts, attitudes you 
don’t like. Those are what you have 
to purge.” 

“Right, Fred. Only the wrong 
kind of Eggheads. Me, hell I’m an 
Egghead too. Remember the prize 
pupil in your psych class at Drake 
University, Fred?” Mesner laughed. 
“That was me.” 

“You can kill people,” I said. 
“You can’t burn a sense of what’s 
right or wrong out of people. That 
old dead blind man there has pre- 
served something you can’t touch.” 

“Too bad you won’t be around 
to see how wrong you are, Fred. 
We can make people whatever we 
damn well want them to be. Your 
old ethical pals worked out the 
methods. We’re using it for a dif- 
ferent end.” 

The front door squeaked. I felt 
a moist draft on my face, and a 
whisper in my brain. A few words. 
I don’t remember what they were. 
But they were a key that opened 
floodgates of self-understanding 

80 



and awareness. I remembered a lot 
then, a lot of things and feelings 
that warmed me. I had a wonder- 
ful sense of wholeness and I was 
no longer afraid of being bipped, 
or afraid to die. 

There was an expression of com- 
plete triumph on Mesner’s face, 
and he knew what had happened 
to me and he wanted it, all of it, 
sucked away into his briefcase. Just 
the same, the whisper from the 
doorway distracted his attention 
and I went for him. 

In that second of time, I saw 
the little blind girl who had whis- 
pered that triggering phrase for my 
release, and behind her, the seeing- 
eye dog. She was utterly unafraid 
and smiling at me. Courage she 
was saying. And I could share it 
with her. 

She had sealed her own death in 
order to make me whole again. 

I smashed the flashlight off the 
table into the wall and my weight 
drove Mesner onto the floor. I man- 
aged to grab his arm and we lay 
there in the dark straining for the 
nerve-gun. I began to hear the 
whir of heliocars. I twisted Mes- 
ner’s arm up and around and re- 
leased the nerve-gun’s full charge 
directly into his face. A stammer- 
ing scream came out of him. It was 
the scream of something not hu- 
man. A full charge of that into the 
brain, it must have curled up the 
intricate connections and short cir- 
cuited his brain into an irreparable 
hash. 

I took the blind girl’s hand and 
we ran toward the river. The sky 
was crossed with search beams. 
And in the deep darkness by the 

BRYCE WALTON 




river I was suddenly as blind as 
the girl who held my hand. We 
kept running and stumbling 
through the reeds. I felt her hand 
slip from mine. Then something hit 
me. 

It wasn’t a localized impact, but 
something seemed to have hit me 
all over and moved through me as 
though my blood suddenly turned 
to lead. 

I tried to find the girl. I tried to 
crawl to the river, into the river. 
And near me I heard the girl say 
softly, “Goodbye now, Mr. Fred- 
ricks. Don’t worry, because you’ll 
be brave.” 

“Thanks,” I said. “Little girl, 
what’s your name?” 

She didn’t answer. I tried to call 
out to her again in the darkness, 
but I couldn’t move my lips. Paral- 
ysis gripped me, and after that 
blackness, with the lights some- 
time later beginning to flicker 
against my tearing eyes, and then 
the horror. 



T he inquisition ended 

sooner than I thought it would. 
After the awful intrusion, there 
isn’t any farther awareness of time. 
After you are thoroughly invaded, 
after your private soul, every 
naked cell of your brain is peeled 
open, exposed to the raw glaring 
light, after that you no longer 
care. What is you has been ob- 
literated the way a shadow is eaten 
by the burn of cold light. 

Your identity is gone. They take 
it. You are theirs, all of you be- 
longs to them. You feel them pour- 
ing out your mind down to the 

DARK WINDOWS 



pitiful dregs as though they are 
p>ouring cups of coffee. 

The pain is a shredding, ripping, 
raveling horror. After that there is 
no feeling at all, and this is worse. 

I told them everything I knew. 
What I couldn’t tell, they tapped, 
tearing chunks out the way you 
would rip pages and chapters out 
of a book. 

The responsible humanists, scien- 
tists, intellectuals had known what 
was coming. They prepared for it, 
and set up the plan before the last 
days of the Egghead purge. They 
set up the future saboteurs by a 
long intricate process of psychody- 
namic conditioning. They did it in 
the Universities before the schools 
were purged. Promising students 
were selected, worked on. 

Fredricks, a psychology student, 
was subjected to repeat^ hypnotic 
experiments. A blind Professor 
named O’Hara did most of it. It 
was all there finally in Fredrick’s 
head, but then it was all suppressed 
and finally Fredricks himself for- 
got that he knew. A delayed hyp- 
notic response pattern, an analogue, 
is set up. Later it will be triggered 
off by a phrase, a word, a series of 
words repeated at conditioned re- 
sponse intervals. 

Ten years later he was working 
inside, inside Security itself. When 
circumstances were right, a blind 
courier was to have triggered off 
Fredrick’s suppressed knowledge 
allowing him to sabotage the entire 
Department of Records and Sci- 
entific Method. So many scientists 
and intellectuals had already been 
purged that few remained among 
the available personnel of Security 

81 




who could have repaired a simple 
gasoline motor without a step-by- 
step chart taken from the Depart- 
ment of Records. 

It would have been a master 
coup for the underground. 

But Mesner had traced Fred- 
rick’s identity back to Drake Uni- 
versity, back to O’Hara. He had 
gotten suspicious, and removed 
Fredricks from Security. 

The blind girl had whispered 
the key phrase just the same, in 
order that Fredricks might face the 
ordeal of the inquisition with as 
much pride, strength, and courage 
as possible. 

“Only a free man, a man who 
fully respects himself as an indi- 
vidual and a human being,” Fred- 
ricks told his inquisitors, “only a 
man who has learned why he is liv- 
ing, can die like a man.” 

Then they killed me. 

They tried to get more out of 
me, but what they wanted to know, 
I knew nothing whatever about. I 
knew nothing about the under- 
ground, or the headquarters of the 
Eggheads. 

But by then I was dead, and 
what they did was of no impor- 
tance. I was no longer me. There 
was no awareness of being me. I 
had joined Dirkson and the rene- 
gade biochemist and all the others. 

I was hopping up and down in a 
cage before the Tevee cameras, and 
a reporter was talking to millions 
of smiling, care-free citizens and 
telling them how another vicious 
crackpot had been captured just in 
time to avert some terrible disaster 
which would have disturbed the 
status quo. 

82 



Then I was taken away. 

“Are you awake now, Mr. Fred- 
ricks?” 

I opened my eyes. I was in a 
clean white room lying near a 
barred window. An attractive nurse 
smiled at me. She was holding a 
clipboard and making notations on 
a report pad. 

“How do you feel now, Fred?” 
Painfully, I turned and saw several 
ghosts standing and sitting on the 
other side of the bed. I could see a 
door behind them, partly opened 
onto a softly lit corridor. 

There was Dr. Malden, a famous 
anthropologist whom I had last 
seen in a newspaper headline dur- 
ing the purge. And Dr. Marquand, 
Nobel Prize winner in electrobiolo- 
gy. And Dr. Martinson, one time 
head of the UN Research Founda- 
tion. Dr. Rothberg, social psycholo- 
gist. All dead, all purged, hipped 
and confined years ago. All ghosts. 

Only they were there. And they 
were alive, and they seemed glad 
to see me. All I knew was that I 
was alive again. I was aware of be- 
ing me. And somehow I knew that 
these forgotten names were also 
alive again. 

Rothberg handed me a cigarette 
and the nurse lit it for me. I re- 
membered that once I had liked 
cigarettes. 

“So what’s happened,” I said. 
My voice was weak. My insides 
felt as though they were filled with 
grinding pieces of broken razor 

“You’re in Zany-Ward No. 104,” 
Dr. Rothberg said. 

“I don’t believe I quite under- 
stand,” 1 said carefully. 

DARK WINDOWS 




“You will,” Dr. Rothberg said. 
“Let’s just say for a starter that 
when a man is hipped and brought 
here, we try to put him back to- 
gether again. It’s a long painful 
process. Sometimes he’s not quite 
the same, but we’ve done pretty 
good work. We rebuild burned-out 
circuits. We have to know exactly 
what you were before you were 
hipped, and we try to duplicate the 
pattern. Regeneration is slow and 
rough. You’ll be all right.” 

"I'hey shook hands with me and 
smiled down at me and went out. 
The pretty nurse gave me a pill 
and I lay back and thought about 
it. It was logical enough, and I 
started to laugh. During the months 
after that while the slow process of 
re-learning and regeneration con- 
tinued, I learned more about the 
Zany- Wards. Serious as it was, and 



as much as there was yet to be 
done, it was always amusing. 

As Eggheads were apprehended 
and confined, they were rehabili- 
tated, put back together again, in a 
way you could say fissioned. The 
Eggheads are the inmates. They, 
run the Zany- Wards which are 
used also as bases of operation in 
a continuing attempt to disrupt the 
Era of Normalcy. Great scientific 
labs are concealed underground. 

When Security inspection com- 
mittees appear on the scene, we all 
put on our acts. We dance, make 
faces, act like monkeys and giggle. 

Doctor Rothberg told me yester- 
day that if our sabotage work 
doesn’t soon cause people to rebel 
against the Era of Normalcy, it 
won’t be long before we’ll be the 
only sane people left in the world.

The tenth son of a tenth son was very sick, but it was written 



that he would never die. Of course, it was up to 
the Earth doctor to see that he didn’t! 



T hey didn’t realize they were in trouble until 
it was too late to stop it. The call from Morua 
II came in quite innocently, relayed to the ship 
from HQ in Standard GPP Contract code for 
crash priority, which meant Top Grade Planetstry 
Emergency, and don’t argue about it, fellows, just 
get there, fast. Red Doctor Sam Jenkins took one 
look at the flashing blinker and slammed the con- 
trols into automatic ; gyros hummed, bearings were 
computed and checked, and the General Practice 




BY ALAN E. NOURSE 





Illustrated by Ed Emsh 



Patrol ship Lancet spun in its tracks, so to speak, 
and began homing on the call-source like a hound 
on a fox. The fact that Morua II was a Class VI 
planet didn’t quite register with anybody, just then. 

Ten minutes later the Red Doctor reached for 
the results of the Initial Information Survey on 
Morua II, and let out a howl of alarm. A single 
card sat in the slot with a wide black stripe across 
it. 

Jenkins snapped on the intercom. “Wally,” he 
yelped. “Better get up here fast.” 



85 



“Trouble?” said the squawk-box^ 
sleepily. 

“Oh, brother,” said Jenkins. 
“Somebody’s cracked the Contract 
Code or something.” 

A moment later a tall sleepy man 
in green undershorts appeared at 
the control room, rubbing his eyes. 
“What happened?” he said. 
“We’ve changed course.” 

“Yeah. Ever hear of Morua II?” 

Green Doctor Wally Stone 
frowned and scratched his whisk- 
ered chin. “Sounds familiar, but I 
can’t quite tune in. Crash call?” 
His eye caught the black-striped 
card. “Class VI planet ... a plague 
spot! How can we get a crash-call 
from this?"^ 

“You tell me,” said Jenkins. 

“Wait a minute. Seems to me 
there was some sort of nasty busi- 
ness — ” 

Jenkins nodded heavily. “There 
sure was. Five successive attempts 
to establish a Contract with them, 
and five times we got thrown out 
bodily. The last time an Earth ship 
landed there half the crew was 
summarily shot and the others 
came home with their ears cut off. 
Seems the folks on Morua II didn’t 
want a Contract with Hospital 
Earth. And they’re still in the jun- 
gle, as far as their medicine goes. 
Witch doctors and spells.” He 
tossed the Info-card down the 
chute with a growl. “So now we 
have an emergency call from them 
in a Contract code they couldn’t 
p>ossibly know.” 

The surgeon in the green under- 
shorts chewed his lip. “Looks like 
somebody in that last crew spilled 
the beans before they shot him.” 



“Obviously.” 

“Well, what arc we doing on 
automatics? We’re not going there, 
are we?” 

“What else? You know the law. 
Instantaneous response to any 
crash-priority call, regardless of cir- 
cumstances — ” 

“Law be damned,” Stone cried. 
“File a protest with HQ. Cancel 
the course bearings and thumb our 
noses at them!” 

“And spend the next twenty 
years scrubbing test tubes.” Jenkins 
shook his head “Sorry, it took me 
too long to get aboard one of these 
tubs. We don’t do that in the Gen- 
eral Practice Patrol, remember? I 
don’t know how Morua II got the 
code, but they got it, and that’s all 
the farther we’re supposed to think. 
We answer the call, and beef about 
it later. If we still happen to be 
around later, that is.” 

It had always been that way. 
Since the first formal Medical Serv- 
ice Contract had been signed with 
Deneb III centuries before. Hos- 
pital Earth had laboriously built its 
reputation on that single founda- 
tion stone: immediate medical as- 
sistance, without question or hesi- 
tation, whenever and wherever it 
was required, on any planet bound 
by Contract. That was the law, for 
Hospital Earth could not afford to 
jeopardize a Contract. 

In the early days of galactic ex- 
ploration, of course. Medical Serv- 
ices was only a minor factor in an 
expanding commercial network 
that drew multitudes of planets into 
social and economic interdepend- 
ence; but in any growing civiliza-

tion division of labor inevitably oc- 
curs. Other planets outstripped 
Earth in technology, in communica- 
tions, in transport, and in produc- 
tion techniques — ^but Earth stood 
unrivaled in its development of the 
biological sciences. Wherever an 
Earth ship landed, the crew was 
soon rendering Medical Services of 
one sort or another, whether they 
had planned it that way or not. On 
Deneb III the Medical Service 
Contract was formalized, and Hos- 
pital Earth came into being. Into 
all known corners of the galaxy 
ships of the General Practice Patrol 
were dispatched — “Galactic Pill 
Peddlers” forging a chain of Con- 
tracts from Aldebaran to Zam, ac- 
cepting calls, diagnosing ills, ar- 
ranging for proper disposition of 
whatever medical problems they 
came across. Serious problems were 
shuttled back to Hospital Earth 
without delay; more frequently the 
GPP crews — doctors of the Red 
and Green services, representing 
the ancient Earthly arts of medicine 
and surgery — were able to handle 
the problems on the spot and by 
themselves. 

It was a rugged service for a sin- 
gle planet to provide, and it was 
costly. Many planets studied the 
terms of Contract and declined, 
pleasantly but firmly — and were as- 
sured nevertheless that GPP ships 
would answer an emergency call if 
one was received. There would be 
a fee, of course, but the call would 
be answered. And then there were 
other planets — places such as 

Morua II .

ugly fighter ships which had 
swarmed up like hornets to greet 
her. They triangled her in, ^ap- 
pled her, and dropped her with a 
bone- jarring crash into a landing 
slot on the edge of the city. As 
Sam Jenkins and Wally Stone 
picked themselves off the bulk- 
heads, trying to rearrange the scar- 
let and green uniforms of their 
respective services, the main en- 
trance lock burst open with a 
squeal of tortured metal. At least 
a dozen Moruans poured into the 
control room — huge bearlike crea- 
tures with heavy grey fur ruffing 
out around their faces like thick 
hairy dog collars. The one in com- 
mand strode forward arrogantly, 
one huge paw leveling a placer- 
gun with a distinct air of business 
about it. “Well, you took long 
enough!” he roared, baring a set 
of yellow fangs that sent shivers 
up Jenkins spine. “Fourteen hours! 
Do you call that speed?” 

Jenkins twisted down the volume 
on his Translator with a grimace. 
“You’re lucky we came at all,” he 
said peevishly. “Where’s your Con- 
tract? Where did you get the 
Code?” 

“Bother the Contract,” the 
Moruan snarled. “You’re supposed 
to be physicians, eh?” He eyed 
them up and down as though he 
disapproved of everything that he 
saw. “You make sick people well?” 
“That’s the general idea.” 

“All right.” He poked a hairy 
finger at a shuttle car perched 
outside. “In there.” 

They were herded into the car 
with three guards in front and 
three behind. A tunnel gulped them 



87 




into darkness as the car careened 
madly into the city. For an endless 
period they pitched and churned 
through blackness — then suddenly 
emerged into a high, gilded hall 
with pale sunlight filtering down. 
From the number of decorated 
guards, and the scraping and grov- 
eling that went on as they were 
hurried through embattled corri- 
dors, it seemed likely they were 
nearing the seat of government. 
Finally a pair of steel doors opened 
to admit them to a long, arched 
hallway. Their leader, who was 
called Aguar by his flunkies, halted 
them with a snarl and walked 
across to the tall figure guarding 
the far door. The guard did not 
seem pleased; he wore a long pur- 
ple cap with a gold ball on the 
end which twitched wildly as their 
whispered conference devolved into 
growling and snarling. Finally 
Aguar motioned them to follow, 
and they entered the far chamber, 
with Purple-Hat glaring at them 
malignantly as they passed. 

Aguar halted them at the door- 
way. “His Eminence will see you,” 
he growled. 

“Who is His Eminence?” Jen- 
kins asked. 

“The Lord High Emperor of All 
Morua and Creator of the Galax- 
ies,” Aguar rumbled. “He is the 
Tenth Son of a Tenth Son, and it 
is written that he can never die. 
When you enter, bow,” he added. 

The Tenth Son of a Tenth Son 
couldn’t have cared less whether 
they bowed or not. The room was 
dark and rank with the smell of 
sickness. On a pallet in the center 
lay a huge Moruan, panting and 

88 



groaning. He was wrapped like a 
mummy in bedclothes of scarlet in- 
terwoven with gold; on either side 
of the bed braziers flickered with 
sickly greenish light. 

His Eminence looked up at 
them from bloodshot eyes and 
greeted them with a groan of an- 
guish that seemed to roll up from 
the soles of his feet. “Go away,” he 
moaned, closing his eyes again and 
rolling over with his back toward 
them. 

The Red Doctor blinked at his 
companion, then turned to Aguar. 
“What illness is this?” he whis- 
pered. 

“He is afflicted with a Pox, as 
any fool can see. All others it kills 
— ^but His Eminence is the Tenth 
Son of a Tenth Son, and it is writ- 
ten—” 

“Yes, yes, I know. He can never 
die.” Sam gave Wally a sour look. 
“What happens, though, if he just 
up and does?” 

Aguar’s paw came down with a 
clatter on the hilt of his sword. 
"'He does not die. We have you 
here now. You are doctors, you say. 
Cure him.” 

They walked to the bedside and 
lifted back the covers. Jenkins took 
a limp paw in his hand. He finally 
found a palpable pulse just below 
the second elbow joint. It was fast 
and thready. The creature’s skin 
bagged loosely from his arm. 

“Looks like His Eminence can’t 
read,” Wally muttered. “He’s going 
fast. Doc.” 

Jenkins nodded grimly. “What 
does it look like to you?” 

“How should I know? I’ve never 
seen a healthy Moruan before, to 

ALAN E. NOURSE 




say nothing of a sick one. It looks 
like a pox all right.” 

“Probably a viremia of some 
sort.” Jenkins went over the great 
groaning hulk with inquiring fin- 
gers. 

“If it’s a viremia, we’re cooked,” 
Stone whispered. “None of the 
drugs cross over — and we won’t 
have time to culture the stuff and 
grow any new ones — ” 

Jenkins turned to Aguar. “How 
long has this gone on?” 

“For days,” the Moruan growled. 
“He can’t speak. He grows hot and 
cannot eat. He moans until the 
Palace trembles.” 

“What about your own doctors?” 
Aguar spat angrily on the floor. 
“They are jealous as cats until 
trouble comes. Then they hide in 
the caves like chickens. See the 
green flames? Death flames. They 
leave him here to die. But now that 
is all over. We have heard about 
you wizards from Hospital Earth. 
You cure all, the stories say. You 
are very wise, they say. You bal- 
ance the humors and drive forth 
the spirits of the Pox like devils.” 
He gave them a terrible grin and 
tightened his hand on the gold-en- 
crusted sword. “Now we see.” 

“We can’t promise,” Jenkins be- 
gan. “Sometimes we’re called too 
late — but perhaps not in this case,” 
he added hastily when he saw the 
Moruan’s face. “Tenth Son and 
all that. But you’ll have to give 
us freedom to work.” 

“What kind of freedom?” 

“We’ll need supplies and infor- 
mation from our ship. We’ll have to 
consult your physicians. We’ll need 
healthy Moruans to examine — ” 

RX 



“But you will cure him,” Aguar 
said. 

Jenkins took a deep breath and 
gripped his red tunic around his 
throat tightly. “Sure, sure,” he said 
weakly. “You just watch us.” 

^^OUT WHAT DO you think 
we’re going to do?” the sur- 
geon wailed, back in the control 
room of the Lancet, “Sam, we can’t 
touch him. If he didn’t die natural- 
ly we’d kill him for sure! We can’t 
go near him without a Bio-survey — 
look what happened on Baron 
when they tried it! Half the plane- 
tary population wiped out before 
they realized that the antibiotic 
was more deadly to the race than 
the virus was . .” 

“Might not be such a bad idea 
for Morua,” the Red Doctor mut- 
tered grimly. “Well, what did you 
expect me to do — politely refuse? 
And have our throats slit right on 
the spot?” He grabbed a pad and 
began scribbling. “We’ve got to do 
something just to keep alive for a 
while.” 

“Yeah,” said Wally. “What, for 
instance?” 

“Well, we’ve got a little to go on 
just from looking at them. They’re 
oxygen-breathers, which means 
they manage internal combustion 
of carbohydrates, somehow. From 
the grey skin color I’d guess at a 
cuprous or stannous heme-protein 
carrying system. They’re carnivores, 
but god knows what their protein 
metabolism is like — Let’s get going 
on some of these specimens Aguar 
has rounded up for us.” 

They dug in frantically. Under 



89 




normal conditions a GPP ship 
would send in a full crew of tech- 
nicians to a newly-Contracted 
planet to make the initial Bio-sur- 
vey of the indigenous races. Bio- 
chemists, physiologists, anatomists, 
microbiologists, radiologists — survey 
workers from every Service would 
examine and study the new clients, 
take them apart cell by cell to see 
what made them tick. 

Certain basic principles were al- 
ways the same, a fact which accel- 
erated the program considerably. 
Humanoid or not, all forms of life 
had basic qualities in common. 
Biochemical reactions were bio- 
chemical reactions, whether they 
happened to occur in a wing-crea- 
ture of Wolf IV or a doctor from 
Sol III. Anatomy was a broad de- 
terminant: a jelly-blob from Deneb 
I with its fine skein of pulsating 
nerve fibrils was still just a jelly- 
blob, and would never rise above 
the level of amoeboid yes-no re- 
sponse because of its utter lack of 
organization. But a creature with 
an organized central nervous sys- 
tem and a functional division of 
work among organ systems could 
be categorized, tested, studied, and 
compared, and the information 
used in combating native disease. 
Given no major setbacks, and full 
cooperation of the natives, the job 
only took about six months to do — 

For the crew of the Lancet six 
hours was seven hours too long. 
They herded cringing Moruan 
“volunteers” into the little ship’s 
lab. Jenkins handled external ex- 
aminations and blood and tissue 
chemistries; Stone ran the X-ray 
and pan-endoscopic examinations.

After four grueling hours the Red 
Doctor groaned and scowled at the 
growing pile of data. “Okay. It 
seems that they’re vaguely human- 
oid. And that’s about all we can 
say for sure. I think we’re wasting 
time. What say we tackle the Wiz- 
ards for a while?” 

Aguar’s guards urged the tall 
Moruan with the purple cap into 
the control room at gunpoint, along 
with a couple of minor medical 
potentates. Purple-hat’s name was 
Kiz, and it seemed that he wasn’t 
having any that day. 

“Look,” said Jenkins intensely. 
“You’ve seen this illness before. We 
haven’t. So you can at least get us 
started. What kind of course does 
it run?” 

Silence. 

“All right then, what causes it? 
Do you know? Bacteria? Virus? 
Degeneration?” 

Silence. 

Jenkins’ face was pale. “Look, 
boys — ^your Boss out there is going 
to cool before long if something 
doesn’t happen fast — ” His eyes 
narrowed on Kiz. “Of course, that 
might be right up your alley — 
how about that? His Eminence 
bows out, somebody has to bow in, 
right? Maybe you, huh?” 

Kiz began sputtering indignant- 
ly; the Red Doctor cut him off. “It 
adds up,” he said heatedly. “You’ve 
got the power, you’ve got your 
magic and all. Maybe you were the 
boys that turned thumbs down so 
violently on the idea of a Hospital 
Earth Contract, eh? Couldn’t risk 
having outsiders cutting in on your 
trade.” Jenkins rubbed his chin 
thoughtfully. “But somehow it 

ALAN E. NOURSE 




seems to me you’d have a whale of 
a lot more power if you learned 
how to control this Pox.” 

Kiz stopped sputtering quite ab- 
ruptly. He blinked at his confed- 
erates for a long moment. Then: 
“You’re an idiot. It can’t be done.” 
“Suppose it could.” 

“The Spirit of the Pox is too 
strong. Our most powerful spells 
make him laugh. He eats our pow- 
ders and drinks our potions. Even 
the Iron Circle won’t drive him 
out.” 

“Won’t it, now! Well, we have 
iron needles and potions that eat 
the bottoms out of their jars. Sup- 
pose they drive him out?” 

The Moruan was visibly shaken. 
He held a whispered conference 
with his henchmen. “You’ll show 
us these things?” he asked suspi- 
ciously. 

“I’ll make a bargain,” said Jen- 
kins. “You give us a Contract, we 
give you the power — ^fair enough?” 
More whispers. Wally Stone 
tugged at Sam’s sleeve. “What do 
you think you’re doing?” he 
choked. “These boys will cut your 
throat quicker than Aguar will — ” 
“Maybe not,” said Sam. “Look, 
I’ve got an idea — risky, but it 
might work if you’ll play along. 
We can’t lose much.” 

The whispers stopped and Kiz 
nodded to the Red Doctor. “All 
right, we bargain,” he said. After 
you show us.” 

“Now or never.” Jenkins threw 
open the door and nodded to the 
guards. “I’ll be in the sickroom in a 
very short while. If you’re with me. 
I’ll see you there. If not — ” He fin- 
gered his throat suggestively.

As soon as they had gone Jenkins 
dived into the storeroom and began 
throwing flasks and bottles into a 
black bag. Wally Stone watched 
him in bewilderment. “You’re 
going to kill him,” he moaned. 
“Prayers, promises, pills and post- 
mortems. That’s the Medical serv- 
ice for you.” 

Sam grinned. “Maybe you should 
operate on him. That would open 
their eyes all right.” 

“No thanks, not me. This is a 
medical case and it’s all yours. 
What do you want me to do?” 
“Stay here and try your damned- 
est to get through to HQ,” said 
Sam grimly. “Tell them to send 
an armada, because we’re liable to 
need one in the next few hours — ” 



I F THE TENTH Son of a Tenth 
Son had looked bad before, 
three hours had witnessed no im- 
provement. The potentate’s skin 
had turned from grey to a pasty 
green as he lay panting on the bed. 
He seemed to have lost strength 
enough even to groan, and his 
eyes were glazed. 

Outside the royal chambers Jen- 
kins found a group of green-clad 
mourners, wailing like banshees 
and tearing out their fur in great 
grey chunks. They stood about a 
flaming brazier; as Jenkins entered 
the sickroom the wails rose ten 
decibels and took on a howUng-dog 
quality. 

Aguar met him at the door. “He’s 
dying,” he roared angrily. “Why 
don’t you do something? Every hour 
he sinks more rapidly, and aJl you 
do is poke holes in the healthy 



91 




ones! And then you send in this 
bag of bones again — ” He glowered 
at the tall purple-capped figure 
bending over the bed. 

Jenkins looked sharply at Kiz, 
and the wizard nodded his head 
slowly. “Try being quiet for a 
while,” Jenkins said to Aguar. 
“We’re going to cure the Boss 
here.” Solemnly he slipped off his 
scarlet tunic and cap and laid them 
on a bench, then set his black bag 
carefully on the floor and threw it 
open. “First off, get rid of those 
things.” He pointed to the braziers 
at the bedside. “They’re enough to 
give anybody a headache. And tell 
those people outside to stop the 
racket. How can they expect the 
Spirit of the Pox to come out of 
His Eminence when they’re raising 
a din like that?” 

Aguar’s eyes widened for a 
moment as he hesitated; then he 
threw open the door and screamed 
a command. The wailing stopped 
as though a switch had been 
thrown. As a couple of cowering 
guards crept in to remove the 
braziers. Red Doctor Jenkins drew 
the wizard aside. 

“Tell me what spells you’ve al- 
ready used.” 

Hurriedly, Kiz began enumerat- 
ing, ticking off items on hairy 
fingers. As he talked Jenkins dug 
into the black bag and started as- 
sembling a liter flask, tubing and 
needles. 

“First we brewed witches’ root for 
seven hours and poured it over his 
belly. When the Pox appeared in 
spite of this we lit three red candles 
at the foot of the bed and beat His 
Eminence steadily for one hour 

92 



out of four, with new rawhide. 
When His Eminence protested 
this, we were certain the Spirit had 
possessed him, so we beat him one 
hour out of two — ” 

Jenkins winced as the account- 
ing of cabalistic clap-trap con- 
tinued. His Eminence, he reflected, 
must have had the constitution of 
an ox. He glanced over at the pant- 
ing figure on the bed. “But doesn’t 
anybody ever recover from this?” 

“Oh, yes — if the Spirit that af- 
flicts them is very small. Those are 
the fortunate ones. They grow hot 
and sick, but they still can eat and 
drink — ” The wizard broke off to 
stare at the bottle-and-tube ar- 
rangement Jenkins had prepared. 
“What’s that?” 

“I told you about the iron 
needles, didn’t I? Hold this a mo- 
ment.” Jenkins handed him the 
liter flask. “Hold it high.” He 
began searching for a vein on the 
patient’s baggy arm. The Moruan 
equivalent of blood flowed back 
greenishly in the tube for an in- 
stant as he placed the needle; then 
the flask began to drip slowly. 

Aguar let out a horrified scream 
and raced from the room; in a mo- 
ment he was back with a detach- 
ment of guards, all armed to the 
teeth, and three other Moruan 
physicians with their retinues of 
apprentices. Sam Jenkins held up 
lus hand for silence. He allowed 
the first intravenous flask to pour 
in rapidly; the second he adjusted 
to a steady drip-drip-drip. 

Next he pulled two large bunsen 
burners and a gas tank from the 
bag. These he set up at the foot 
of the bed, adjusting ^e blue flames 

ALAN E. NOURSE 




to high spear- tips. On the bedside 
table he set up a third with a flask 
above it; into this he poured some 
water and a few crystals from a 
dark bottle. In a moment the fluid 
in the flask was churning and boil- 
ing, an ominous purple color. 

Kiz watched goggle-eyed. 

“Now!” said Jenkins, pulling out 
a long thin rubber tube. “This 
should annoy the Spirit of the Pox 
something fierce.” He popped the 
tube into the patient’s mouth. His 
Eminence rose up with a gasp, 
choking and fighting, but the tube 
went down. The Red Doctor 
ground three white pills into 
powder, mixed in some water, and 
poured it down the tube. 

Then he stepped back to view 
the scene, wiping cold perspiration 
from his forehead. He motioned 
to Kiz. “You see what I’m doing, 
of course?” he said loudly enough 
for Aguar and the guards to hear. 

“Oh, yes — yes! Indeed, indeed,” 
said Kiz. 

“Fine. Now this is most im- 
portant.” Jenkins searched in the 
bag until he found a large mortar 
which he set down on the floor. 
Squatting behind it, he began tap- 
ping it slowly with the pestle, in 
perfect rhythm with the intravenous 
drip . and waited. 

The room was deathly still ex- 
cept for a heavy snuffling sound 
from His Eminence and the plink- 
plink of the pestle on the mortar. 
The flask of purple stuff gurgled 
quietly. An hour passed, and an- 
other. Suddenly Jenkins motioned 
to Kiz. “His pulse— quickly!” 

Kiz scampered gratefully over 
to the bedside. “A hundred and 



eighty,” he whispered. 

Jenkins’ face darkened. He 
p>eered at the sick man intently. 
“It’s a bad sign,” he said. “The 
Spirit is furious at the intrusion of 
an outsider.” He motioned toward 
the mortar. “Can you do this?” 

Without breaking the rhythm 
he transferred the plinking-job to 
Kiz. He changed the dwindling 
intravenous bottle. “Gall me when 
the bottle is empty — or if there is 
any change. Whatever you do, 
don^t touch anything.^^ 

With that he tiptoed from the 
room. Four murderous-looking 
guards caught Aguar’s eye and fol- 
lowed him out, swords bared. Jen- 
kins sank down on a bench in the 
hall and fell asleep in an instant. 

They woke him once, hours later, 
to change the intravenous solution, 
and he found Kiz still intently 
pounding on the mortar. Jenkins 
administered more of the white 
powder in water down the tube, 
and went back to his bench. He 
had barely fallen asleep again when 
they were rousing him with fright- 
ened voices. “Quickly!” Aguar 
cried. “There’s been a terrible 
change!” 

In the sickroom His Eminence 
was drenched with sweat, his face 
glistening in the light of the bun- 
sen burners. He rolled from side 
to side, groaning hoarsely. ^^Faster!'' 
Jenkins shouted to Kiz at the mor- 
tar, and began stripping off the 
sodden bedclothes. “Blankets, no\v 
— plenty of them.” 

The plink-plink rose to a frantic 
staccato as Jenkins checked the 
patient’s vital signs, wiped more 



RX 



93 




sweat from his furJ7 brow. Quite 
suddenly His Eminence opened 
bleary eyes, stared about him, let 
out a monumental groan and buried 
his head in the blankets. In two 
minutes he was snoring softly. His 
face was cool now, his heart-beat 
slow and regular. 

Jenkins snatched the mortar 
from Kiz, and with a wild flourish 
smashed it on the stone floor. Then 
he grabbed the wizard’s paw, rais- 
ing it high. “You’ve done well!” 
he cried to the bewildered phy- 
sician. “It’s over now — the Spirit 
has departed. His Eminence will 
recover.” 



T hey escorted him in tri- 
umphal procession back to the 
Lancet, where Wally Stone stared 
in disbelief as Jenkins and Kiz 
bowed and hugged each other like 
long-lost brothers at a sad fare- 
well. “I finally got through to 
somebody at HQ,” he said as the 
Red Doctor climbed aboard. “It’ll 
take them twenty days at least, to 
get help, considering that Morua 
is not a Contract planet and we’re 
not supposed to be here in the first 
place, but that’s the best they can 
do . , 

“Tell them to forget the armada,” 
said Jenkins, grinning. “And any- 
way, they’ve got things all wrong 
back at HQ.” He brandished a huge 
roll of parchment, stricken through 
with the colors of the seven Medi- 
cal Services of Hospital Earth. 
“Take a look, my boy — the juiciest 
Medical Services Contract that’s 
been written in three centuries — ” 
He tossed the Contract in the dry- 

94 



storage locker with a sigh. “Old 
Kiz just finished his first lesson, and 
he’s still wondering what went 
on — ” 

“So am I,” said the Green 
Doctor suspiciously. 

“It was simple. We cured His 
Eminence of the Pox.” 

“With what? Incantations?” 

“Oh, the incantations were for 
the doctors/" said Jenkins. “They 
expected them, obviously, since 
that was the only level of medicine 
they could understand. And inci- 
dentally, the only level that could 
possibly get us a Contract. Anyway, 
I couldn’t do very much else, 
under the circumstances, except 
for a little supportive therapy. Witn- 
out a Bio-survey we were ham- 
strung. But whatever the Pox is, 
it obviously involves fever, starva- 
tion and dehydration. I knew that 
His Eminence could assimilate 
carbohydrates, and I took a long 
gamble that an antipyretic wouldn’t 
hurt him too much — ” 

Wally Stone’s jaw sagged. “So 
you treated him with sugar-water 
and aspirin,” he said weakly. “And 
on that you risked our necks.” 

“Not quite,” said the Red Doc- 
tor. “You’re forgetting that I had 
one other prescription to use — the 
oldest, most trustworthy healer-of- 
all-ills known to medicine, just as 
potent now as it was a thousand 
years ago. Without it. Hospital 
Earth might just as well pack up 
her little black bag and go home.” 
He smiled into the mirror as he 
adjusted the scarlet band of the 
Red Service across his shoulders. 
“We call it Tincture of Time,” he 
said. END

THE POORS 

BY HARRY LORAYNE 



Illustrated by Paul Orban 



T he world newspapers had 
heralded the event for months. 
^‘The First Personal Visit from 
Outer Space” was the most im- 
portant headline of the decade. 
Now there were perhaps sixty 
thousand people crowding behind 



95 




ropes and guards at the Earth In- 
terspace Airport, waiting patiently 
for Mr. Kramvit of Planet Six. 

Fourth Vice President Vincent 
J. Carrowick had been selected to 
be Mr. Kramvit’s guide for the 
length of his visit. He was waiting 
now, with Secretary Gordon, in 
the airport’s executive office. 

Carrowick spoke first, “Well, 
this is it. I’ve spoken to Kramvit at 
least eight times on the Vidcope 
phone, but I’m as nervous as a 
contestant right now.” 

Gordon eyed the screen which 
was noting the ship’s approach. “I 
don’t see why you should be. You 
know what he’s like basically. Their 
bodies and physical capabilities are 
the same as ours, and most of the 
people of Six speak English almost 
as well as we do, by now.” 

He looked at Carrowick, “Are 
their Vidcopes going to stay on 
Kramvit during his entire visit?” 

Carrowick spoke slowly, “Yes. 
At least they’re going to try; on 
all six of the Planets. Kramvit’s 
going to carry a pin microphone 
on his person all the time. So they 
should see and hear us no matter 
where we are.” 

“How long do you intend to be 
out of the country with him?” 
asked Gordon. 

“Well, most of his time will be 
spent here, visiting all fifty-three 
states. We’ll take one cruise to pay 
token visits to the heads of all 
countries first, then back here until 
he goes home. Hey! He’s landing, 
let’s go!” 

. After over an hour of wel- 
coming speeches, photographs and 
newspaper reporters, Marryl Kram- 

96 



vit was alone in the executive of- 
fice with Vice President Carrowick 
and Secretary Gordon. 

“If we didn’t know you were 
from Six, we would certainly take 
you for an Earthman,” Carrowick 
was saying, “Why, your clothes, 
your coloring, ever^hing about 
you is just the same!” 

Kramvit smiled and said, “Well, 
thank you. Physically, of course, we 
are the same. The clothes — ^well, 
ours are quite a bit different, as 
you know. I had these made by a 
superb tailor who copied them 
from our Vidcope screens. 

“Many of our females,” Kramvit 
continued, “have already started to 
wear some of your ladies’ styles, 
and quite becoming they are.” 
Carrowick put on his cloak, and 
said, “Well, let’s be on our way. 
You’re to meet our President for 
lunch, and then we start our tour, 
if that’s all right with you.” 

“Why, of course, that’s why I’m 
here, and I’m anxious to see your 
world. Particularly America.” 

The trip around the world had 
gone as smoothly as could be ex- 
pected. Were it not for the multi- 
tudes that gathered at each air- 
port in order to catch a glimpse of 
Kramvit, it would have been just 
perfect. Kramvit, however, was as 
cordial to the throngs as he was to 
the heads of their respective coun- 
tries. He was a fine good will am- 
bassador. A little flicker of dis- 
appointment was usually evident 
when the people saw for themselves 
that this man from another world 
looked and acted just as they did. 
All in all, Carrowick was quite 

HARRY LORAYNE 




pleased, and he and Kramvit were 
now in the Vincent and Marryl 
stage, except in public. 

“Well, you’ve been in most of 
the countries of the Earth,” said 
Carrowick, as they relaxed in the 
private plane, “and visited forty of 
our States of America. What do 
you think, Marryl?” 

“I’m pleased, of course.” an- 
swered Kramvit. “You’re aware, 
I’m sure, Vincent, that Six and the 
other five planets of the Orb are 
a bit farther advanced than Earth. 
But, I don’t think it will be very 
long before you’re up to us. 

“I’ve been able to understand al- 
most everything I’ve seen,” he con- 
tinued, “and I’ve made notes of 
what I couldn’t understand; one 
thing y Vincent, you haven’t ex- 
plained to me at all.” 

“What’s that?” 

“Well, so far as I can see, there 
are only two economic classes here 
on Earth. I’ve seen what appear to 
me to be only very wealthy people 
and very, very poor people. I’ve 
also noticed,” here Kramvit smiled, 
“that you have sort of avoided these 
poor people, and what I assume to 
be their dwellings. I’ve seen 
glimpses of the squalor and terribly 
poor sections in each of your states 
so far.” 

Carrowick seemed a bit shocked, 
but Kramvit continued. “Also, you 
have addressed almost all of the 
working people with whom we’ve 
been in contact as Poor Mr. Jones 
and Poor Miss Smith, and so on. 
While those of the wealthy class, 
you simply addressed as Mr. or 
Mrs. Why?” 

Carrowick was shocked. “Didn’t 



you know? No, I see you really 
didn’t. I’m terribly sony, Marryl, 
we here on Earth take it so much 
for granted, and I assumed it was 
the same all over the Orb.” 

“No, I don’t know what you 
mean,” said Kramvit, “on Six and 
the others, we have our quota of 
poor people. We also have a middle 
class, (in which I think I would 
belong) and some very wealthy 
people. But the definite dividing 
line here, I don’t understand. 

“I know some of your ancient 
history, but I’ve noticed complete 
integration wherever I’ve been. I’ve 
seen absolutely no discrimination as 
far as color, faith or religion is 
concerned. I saw no caste system 
at all, even in India, and inter- 
marriage, it seems, has become com- 
pletely acceptable.” 

“That is so,” interrupted Car- 
rowick. “We’ve had no such preju- 
dice at all as long as I’ve been 
alive. It has avoided a lot of 
trouble. Nobody has been able to 
think up a reason for a war, since.” 
“Then why,” asked Kramvit, 
“have I seen these Poors, as you 
call them, sitting only in the rear 
of busses? Why have I not seen one 
of these unfortunate looking people 
in any of the restaurants in which 
we’ve eaten, or for that matter, in 
most any public place?” 

“The reason for them not being 
in any of the restaurants is simple. 
They can’t afford the prices. 
Haven’t you noticed all the Vid- 
cope, or V.C. centers here?” 

“Yes, I have.” 

“You’ve seen some of the V.C. 
shows, haven’t you?” 

“I didn’t pay much attention to 



THE POORS 



97 




them,” answered Kramvit. “Fm 
not much for V.C. Incidentally, we 
call it T.V., for television, at home. 
Many of our people have become 
quite addicted to it in the last 
few years. I can take it or leave 
it alone. Usually the latter, Fm 
airaid.” 

Carrowick asked, “Aren’t all your 
shows Qua shows?” 

“Fm sorry, what is a Qua show?” 
“You’re jesting, of course,” 
laughed Carrowi^. “They were 
once called Quiz shows. Now, 
they’re Quas, for question and 
answer, I guess.” 

“Oh, yes,” said Kramvit, “we 
do have many of those.” 

“Why, that’s all we have here, 
on commercial V.C.” exclaimed 
Carrowick. “And, there’s the ob- 
vious answer to your original ques- 
tion!” 

“The answer? Fm sorry, I don’t 
see what you mean.” 

“It’s simple,” said Carrowick. 
“The Poors are people who have 
never been a contestant on a Qua 
show! The wealthy are those who 
either have been winners, or whose 
ancestors were.” 

It was Kramvit’s turn to be 
shocked. “I don’t believe it.” 

“Oh, yes, it’s true,” said Car- 
rowick. “Of course, some of the 
Poors have been contestants, but 
didn’t win.” 

Kramvit was staring at Car- 
rowick. “You are quite serious, 
aren’t you?” 

“Of course,” answered Carro- 
wick, “the situation has been so, for 
perhaps two hundred years — ^we’ve 
come to take it for what it is.” 
“I’ll wager that the Poors don’t 



take it quite as calmly as you do. 
Don’t tell me that they’re satis- 
fied with their position.” 

“I wouldn’t say they were satis- 
fied,” was the answer, “but they 
know no other way of life, and 
don’t have much choice in the 
matter.” 

Kramvit was finding it difficult 
to picture the situation. “Well, as 
I’ve told you,” he said, “we have 
T.V. on Six, but we’ve been stress- 
ing variety and drama shows. Don’t 
you have any big V.C. stars, like 
comedians or singers here?” 

“No, we don’t. I’ve never seen 
any variety or drama shows on 
V.C.” 

“I’m surprised. You see, we have 
been using all the air time, or most 
of it, for entertainment purposes. 
Commercially, T.V. is just a baby 
with us. We’ve been using it much 
longer than you have, technically, 
but not commercially. I’d say that 
we’ve had sponsored shows for 
about fourteen years.” 

“Oh, then it is a comparatively 
new thing with you,” said Carr- 
owick. “We’ve had commercial Vid- 
cope for over five hundred years.” 
Kramvit shook his head. “I still 
can’t see why your Poors have to 
live in such poverty. Don’t they 
get paid on their jobs?” 

“Why, sure they do,” answered 
Carrowick, “but their rate of pay 
is not particularly high. You see, 
only the Poors do all the menial 
and service work; aside from high 
service positions like government 
work, of course. There are so many 
Poors and so few jobs for them, 
that those that work are little 
better off than those that don’t.”

HARRY LORAYNE 




“I see,” said Kramvit, “and is 
there no protection for these un- 
employed? I mean Social Security 
or unemplyment insurance, which 
I know you did have a long time 
ago. 

“No, there isn’t. We had to stop 
that because if we kept it up we’d 
have no workers at all.” replied 
Carrowick. “Believe me, Marryl, I 
don’t particularly like the situation. 
We’ve tried integration in one or 
two sections, but only riots resulted. 
I think that eventually we’ll eli- 
minate some of the prejudices, but 
it can’t be pushed or hurried. It’ll 
take many years to do it. I’m sure 
I won’t live to see it gone com- 
pletely.” 

“And,” asked Kramvit, “have 
you been a winner on a Qua show?” 
“Oh, no. I’m not one of those 
nouveau riche; my great grand- 
father won eight million dollars, 
tax free, when he was just a boy. 
That took care of us, and will take 
care of us from here on in.” 

“I see,” said Kramvit. “Vincent, 
I want to visit some of these people 
in their homes. Will you take me?” 
Carrowick was shocked again. “I 
don’t think you’ll enjoy it, Marryl. 
Do you really feel it’s necessary?” 
“Please don’t refuse me, Vincent. 
I do feel it’s important. I’ve under- 
stood almost everything I’ve seen 
here on Earth. Either because we’ve 
been faced with it ourselves on 
Six, or I’ve read about it. But this 
is entirely new to me.” 

“All right” " agreed Carrowick 
reluctantly. “I’m supposed to show 
you anything you want to see, but 
you won’t like it.” 

“Let me be the judge of that.” 



HEY HAD RIDDEN to Ae 
end of the upper level moving 
street in comfortable armchairs. All 
of Carrowick’s arguments couldn’t 
swerve Kramvit from his idea of 
visiting some Poors. Kramvit was 
just about through with his ex- 
planation of how all the automo- 
biles on Six drove underground, and 
didn’t have to use the lower street 
level, as they did here; when they 
came to the end of the moving 
street. 

Now they were both walking 
through the filthy, garbage laden 
streets of the Poors’ village. The 
smell wrinkled Carrowick’s nose, 
and he was not displeased to see 
that Kramvit wasn’t quite enjoy- 
ing it, either. 

“Doesn’t the sanitation depart- 
ment know about this?” asked 
Kramvit. “Don’t they ever remove 
this dirt?” 

“No,” answered Carrowick, “the 
Poors have to carry it to appointed 
garbage dumps themselves. They 
let it pile up until even they can’t 
stand it, then they usually get rid 
of some of it.” 

He went on to explain that in 
all the cities, except in Poor villages, 
all garbage recepticles led to giant 
imderground incinerators. Here the 
fires burned continually. But in the 
hot weather, the heat from these 
fires was used as power to run an 
underground air conditioner, so 
that all the streets were cooled. In 
the wintertime, of course, these 
same fires warmed the cities and 
highways. 

As they walked, they were both 
aware of the many Poors scrounging 
and searching in the debris. They 




THE PCX)RS 



99 




were also aware of the silence that 
fell as they neared groups of people. 
The Poors just stared at them, and 
talked excitedly when they were 
out of earshot. 

“They’re not used to seeing any 
of us in their villages,” remarked 
Carrowick. 

Kramvit smiled, somewhat bit- 
terly, it seemed to Carrowick, “No, 
I shouldn’t think they would be.” 
As they rounded a corner, Kram- 
vit pointed to a car parked about a 
hundred feet away. It was almost 
leaning against a broken down 
shack, and was so dirty that it was 
impossible to make out its color. 

“How did that get here, Vincent? 
Surely, nobody here can afford a 
car.” 

Carrowick laughed, “No, they 
can’t. That happens to be this 
year’s Sputzmobile, one of our most 
expensive cars. Although you 
wouldn’t know it from the looks 
of that one. They are given as 
consolation prizes to losers on al- 
most all the larger Qua shows.” 

“I see. Why don’t those people 
sell the cars? It seems to me they 
could use the money.” 

“I guess they could,” answered 
Carrowick. “But to whom could 
they sell it? Very few of us ever 
buy a second hand car. We all 
change our cars as soon as the new 
ones appear. Anyway, most of the 
losers want to keep them ; they 
consider it a mark of distinction.” 
He frowned, and continued, 
“They drive them around the vil- 
lages whenever they can beg, bor- 
row or steal some regular grade 
atomic pellets. And, whenever they 
can maneuver through these streets. 

100 



Those that own them sort of look 
down their noses at the other 
Poors. They consider themselves 
aristocrats of their village, because 
they, at least, have been called to 
appear on a Qua. Actually, they’re 
to be pitied, they’re worse off than 
the others.” 

“Why is that?” asked Kramvit. 

“Well, once they’ve appeared on 
a Qua show, and lost, they’ll usual- 
ly never be asked again. That’s 
the worst of it, since they have noth- 
ing more to look forward to. Also, 
I believe that most of the Poors 
leave whatever jobs they may have, 
as soon as they get the call. They 
feel it’s beneath their dignity some- 
how. No Poor that gets on a Qua 
ever expects to lose. Of course, 
once they do lose, they can’t get 
their jobs back. Because when they 
leave it’s like creating a vacuum — 
all the Poors in the vicinity flock 
to apply for his position.” 

They were just adjacent to one 
of the Poors’ houses at the moment, 
and Kramvit asked if he could visit 
the people that lived there. Car- 
rowick said he could, but he 
doubted if they’d find anyone home. 
It was after four o’clock, and the 
large network Quas had already be- 
gun. All the Poors that could navi- 
gate would be at the large open 
air V.G. centers, which were usual- 
ly located near the garbage dumps. 

These centers were sometimes 
miles away from many of the Poors, 
but that’s where they were, no 
matter what the weather, from 
four in the afternoon to eleven at 
night, when the Quas finished and 
the news flashes began. 

These centers consisted of a large 

HARRY LORAYNE 




empty lot, many of which got the 
overflow from the adjacent garbage 
dumps, with two scopes seemingly 
suspended about six feet off the 
ground in the middle. They were 
rectangular; about five feet long, 
and four feet wide. Only a little 
over an inch thick, the pictures ap- 
peared on both sides of each scope. 
They were at right angles to each 
other, so that the picture could 
be seen from any part of the lot. 

Carrowick knocked on the old 
wooden door. There was no answer, 
and they were about to turn away, 
when the door opened creakily to 
display an elderly man. He was 
clean, except for the dirty rags 
that were tied around his throat. 

Carrowick explained who they 
were, and the elderly gentleman 
invited them in. 

“Come in, come in. I’m honored 
by your visit,” he said in a hoarse 
voice. “Well, now I’m almost glad 
that I have this bad throat, other- 
wise I would be at the center, and 
I’d have missed your visit. By the 
way, my name is Poor Mr. Alex 
Smith.” 

The shack consisted of two 
rooms, one of which was obviously 
a bedroom. Obviously, because 
there were a number of flattish 
mounds of rags, straw and excel- 
sior on the floor, which could serve 
no other purpose than for sleeping. 
It was completely devoid of any 
furniture. The room they were in 
was the combination living-room, 
dining room and kitchen. A few 
old chairs, some crates and a wob- 
bly card table on a bare floor just 
about filled the room. 

Carrowick and Kramvit intro- 



duced themselves, and Kramvit 
started to ask Poor Mr. Smith 
questions. These were all answered 
eagerly, and Kramvit was almost 
convinced that the Poors didn’t 
mind their situation too much ; 
they were all quite used to it. 

Poor Mr. Smith asked some 
questions of Kramvit too, and was 
answered good naturedly. He 
showed particular interest in the 
pin microphone Kramvit wore, and 
seemed awed when he was told that 
he was probably being seen and 
heard by people on Six at this very 
moment. 

While Carrowick showed signs 
of impatience over the length of 
the visit, Kramvit asked Smith, 
“Tell me, my friend, wouldn’t you 
like to see some entertainment on 
V.C.? Comedians or singers, or 
dancers, perhaps?” 

Poor Mr. Smith laughed, “Why 
no. Comedians and singers? Who 
wants to see them when we can 
watch some lucky souls winning 
anywhere from one to sixty-four 
million dollars, or more. I remem- 
ber about forty years ago, Mr. 
Krackel, our largest food pill manu- 
facturer at that time, tried some- 
thing like that.” 

“Oh, did he?” 

“Yes. He had the biggest two 
hour Qua show on the scopes. His 
daughter liked to sing, and she 
talked him into devoting the first 
fifteen minutes to singing. Well,” 
Smith laughed, “that was the last 
time he tried that. I read that the 
ratings for the show that evening 
went down to zero. The studio 
was swamped with angry letters. 
Everyone wanted to know why 

101 



THE POORS 




fifteen minutes of a good Qua show 
was wasted with such nonsense.” 

Kramvit smiled and said, “Yes, 
I can understand that. Tell me. 
Poor Mr. Smith, what would you 
do if you won on a Qua?” 

“I’d try to help my people, of 
course. Perhaps like Legislator 
Brown. He’s an ex-Poor, you know, 
but he worked himself up the hard 
way. Won a Qua, then studied and 
studied, and finally made the Leg- 
islature. He’s the one that pass^ 
the law to give us our V.G. centers. 
He’s a great man.” 

“That’s a worthy ambition,” said 
Kramvit. 

“Do you people on Six have Qua 
shows, too?” asked Poor Mr. Smith. 

“Yes. But not as many as you 
do.” 

“And do you have Poors like me 
on your planet?” 

Kramvit said that they didn’t, 
and went on to explain a little of 
the situation of Six and the other 
five planets. 

Poor Mr. Smith was amazed. He 
couldn’t believe that there was any 
place that didn’t have Poors. 

“Well, don’t let it happen, then,” 
he said. “Don’t do it. Don’t let 
those Qua shows take over.” His 
voice seemed to be getting stronger, 
or was it just louder, now. 

He leaned closer to Kramvit, 
his head only a foot away from the 
pin microphone, and almost 
shouted, “Do you hear me? Don’t 
let it happen to you.” He was near 
to sobbing now. “Be smart, stay 
happy — stop those Quas. They’ll 
only . 

Garrowick practically pulled 
Kramvit out the door, and started 

102 



to hurry away. 

“Well,” said Kramvit, “you told 
me that they didn’t mind their 
situation too much ; Poor Mr. 
Smith almost had me believeing 
the same thing, but he sure didn’t 
convince me.” 

“He’s just a sick, old man,” was 
Garrowick’s answer. 



RAMVIT HAD insisted on 
visiting another Poor village 
the next day. Earlier, this time, so 
that they’d find most of the people 
home. After five or six visits, 
Kramvit was persuaded to leave by 
Garrowick, who reminded him that 
he was to appear on Earth’s larg- 
est Qua show himself that very 
evening. Kramvit didn’t want to 
appear, but Garrowick convinced 
him that all preparations had been 
made. This was Earth’s way of 
honoring him, and he simply 
mustn’t and couldn’t refuse. Also, 
his own people would be watching 
for him on the show. Kramvit had 
to agree to do it. 

When they had arrived at the 
studio, Kramvit was amazed at the 
hustle and bustle that went on 
aroimd them. The usual investiga- 
tions, interviews and testing that 
contestants went through were 
eliminated for Kramvit, since 
he was an honored guest. 

Air time approached rapidly, and 
Kramvit couldn’t help feeling a bit 
apprehensive. He wasn’t used to ap- 
pearing before multitudes of this 
size, and it all made him feel un- 
comfortable. Garrowick assured 
him that there was nothing to fear; 
this was simply a good will ap- 

HARRY LORAYNE 





pearance. The questions he would 
have to answer would all be in the 
science category, and he should 
have no trouble with them. 

Finally, Kramvit found himself 
standing in the wings of the vast 
stage. The previous contestant 
was just answering his last ten part 
question. He answered all the parts 
correctly, and left the stage to loud 
applause. Now the Master of 
Ceremonies asked who was to be 
the next guest. A booming voice 
whose body was nowhere to be 
seen, went through a flowery in- 
troduction of Marryl Kramvit. Two 
beautiful young ladies, dressed in 
almost nothing, appeared on each 
side of him. As the voice finished 
the introduction, the girls all but 
dragged him into camera range. 

Kramvit jumped with fright as 
eight young men, each over six 
feet tall, heralded his entrance 
with long, loud trumpets. He 
shook hands with the Master of 
Ceremonies, chatted for a while, 
and finally was told to get ready for 
his questions. 

The first group of queries per- 
tained to his particular field, and 
he answered them correctly and 
easily. It took about ten minutes to 
arrive at the $10,000 question. 
Kramvit knew that if and when he 
reached a million dollars, he would 
be asked to come back in a week, 
which of course he couldn’t do, 
to tell if he would go for two mil- 
lion or keep the one he had. He 
made a mental note to ask Carro- 
wick as to the fate of those who 
stopped at one or two million. He 
wondered if they were looked down 
upon too. 

THE POORS 



Right now, the M.C. was telling 
him that he would have to enter 
the sound proof booth for the 
$10,000 question. The booth ap- 
peared from nowhere, and he was 
escorted into it by the two lovely, 
almost nude, young ladies, who 
didn’t seem to hear the trumpet 
blasts from the eight young men. 

When the door of the booth 
clicked shut, the booth moved out 
and over the studio audience, and 
finally came to a stop in mid-air. 
There were no wires or cables to 
be seen attached to the booth, but 
this didn’t bother Kramvit, since 
he knew the principles involved. 
He did feel quite ridiculous, hang- 
ing suspended, with hundreds of 
faces upturned to watch him. 

It seemed to him that they must 
be awfully uncomfortable with 
their necks craned like that. But 
he knew that the producers of the 
show were only interested in the 
effect on the home viewers. 

Kramvit lost count of the ques- 
tions he answered, but he was now 
being told that he was going for 
$500,000. A half million dollars! 
That was the largest amount of 
money given away on the biggest 
quiz show on Six; here it was just 
the beginning. 

The question consisted of sixteen 
parts, and he answered them with- 
out interruption until the fourteenth 
part. After he gave his answer to 
this one, the M.C. asked him to 
repeat it. He did, hesitantly, and 
saw the M.C. look nervously to- 
wards the control booth. 

“I’m sorry, Mr. Kramvit, that’s 
not the correct answer.”

B randon was looking at his desk again. 

An artificial grin spread across the narrow face of the 
Secretary of Interior who was watching him closely. The 
Secretary’s pencil-thin fingers continued to toy with the small,

Year after year they came back, despite his 
constant refusals. And still Brandon couldn^t 
figure out why he was so important . 



wood figure he was holding. 
“Brandon,” he tried to lie grace- 
fully, “You’re a card. A real card,” 

Brandon shifted his position, 
brought his attention back to the 
thin man with the receding hair- 
line. He couldn’t, for the life of 
of him, remember anything hu- 
morous he had said or done. He 
was too tired to be jovial. The past 
few days had sapped his strength. 
He was exhausted and there were 
still two more interviews scheduled. 

Good Lord, he thought. Two 
more! He found his eyes wander- 
ing back to his desk. He would 
never finish the papers in time. 
That would mean a severe penalty. 

“Come now, Brandon. Admit it. 
You know you want to work for 
us in Interior.” 

“Right now I don’t know any- 
thing,” Brandon said wearily. “My 
head is tired and clouded. I can’t 
think straight.” He rubbed his hand 
across his forehead, wondering how 
much longer he would be able to 
continue to say no to their requests. 
He had almost found himself agree- 
ing with the thin man a few mo- 
ments ago. That wasn’t good. 

Brandon leaned back in the con- 
tour chair and let some of the 



strength seep back into his out- 
stretched legs. Each year at this 
time they would begin to wander 
in with their strange, outlandish 
offers of positions with the govern- 
ment. It was perplexing. 

“Why me?” he asked suddenly. 
“Why in Interior? I know nothing 
about such work?” 

The thin man leaned foreward, 
“Because you are a good man, Bran- 
don. And we need good men these 
days. Government is big business 
and we want the top positions 
filled with the best men we can 
get. Besides,” the Secretary laughed 
softly, “you’re wasting your time 
playing with dolls.” 

“They aren’t dolls!” Brandon 
said indignantly. 

“So they aren’t dolls,” 

“There is a difference,” Brandon 
insisted. “You make is sound as if 
I’m in my second childhood.” 

“All right. Puppets!” The thin 
man shifted in his chair. He ran 
his lean fingers over the hand- 
painted figure he was holding in 
one hand. “But you can see my 
point.” 

Brandon shook his head. That 
was it. He couldn’t see the point. 
His puppets were becoming world 



105 




famous, the result of reviving the 
almost lost art of hand carving. He 
was earning a fair living at it. He 
could see no reason for a change. 

“Think of the prestige if you 
come with us. You will be heading 
a department of your own,” the 
Secretary said. 

Brandon wrinkled his brow, 
thinking of how his name was al- 
ready associated with his puppets. 
If only they would leave him alone, 
if only there wasn’t so much paper 
work waiting for him on his desk, 
he would be able to spread out, 
expand, really have a going busi- 
ness. But they had to keep pes- 
tering him with worthless offers that 
they knew he couldn’t handle, 
wasting his time, especially now 
when time was of the essence. The 
paper work on his desk had to be 
completed by midnight. He would 
never finish it now. 

Brandon felt the beginning of a 
headache. Because of the paper 
work he hadn’t had time to touch a 
new puppet in months. Now these 
damn interviews were keeping him 
from the desk work. It was a vicious 
circle leading to ruin. 

“You will be serving your Coun- 
try, Brandon,” the Secretary said 
strongly. “Not fiddling with dolls.” 

“I told you ...” 

The Secretary held up his hand. 
“I know. Puppets.” 

Brandon got up and walked to 
the window and looked out at the 
setting sun. It was hard to define; 
there were some things words 
couldn’t explain. All the offers had 
been good ones. But a man had to 
have some rule, some yardstick to 



guide him. Brandon had his. He 
wanted to be useful, that wasn’t too 
much to ask. Life was too short to 
waste laboring in a position he 
wasn’t fitted for. If he took In- 
terior’s offer all that would be 
ended. He would be caught in a 
web which allowed no escape. 

Brandon turned. “I’m afraid, Mr. 
Secretary^, that you don’t under- 
stand my position. It isn’t that I feel 
above being employed by the Presi- 
dent. I have all the resp>ect in the 
world for him and his office. I have 
nothing but respect for you ...” 
“Then what is it, Brandon?” 

“I don’t think I would be happy 
taking orders from some one else.” 
“We all have a boss, Brandon.” 
“I haven’t.” 

The Secretary grinned. “You can 
head your own department. The 
President and myself will be the 
only ones you will have to answer 
to, I promise.” 

“That’s what I mean,” Brandon 
answered softly. 

The Secretary felt his face flush. 
“You are insinuating that you are 
above working for the President, 
Mr. Brandon!” he said stiffly. 

“You’re twisting words.” Bran- 
don’s voice was determined. “It’s 
just that I like to work alone. I like 
to put my hat on and go, whenever, 
and wherever I please.” 

The Secretary shook his head 
“Brandon! I happen to know that 
you haven’t been off this estate, 
this property of yours, in the past 
five years.” 

“That doesn’t alter a thing. I can 
go, anytime I please. I have no 
reason to leave now. But when I do, 
I won’t feel obligated, I won’t have

106 




to ask permission.” 

The Secretary relaxed. “You can 
do that in the department any^e 
you wish. Visit the conservations, 
then, when you are tired of traips- 
ing around, you can come back and 
write up a report or two.” The Sec- 
retary cleared his throat. “Just for 
the records, of course.” 

Brandon sighed. “Of course. Just 
for the records.” He brushed back 
his thick, black hair and sat down. 
Damn it. Why couldn’t they leave 
him alone? That was all he wanted, 
to be left alone. He was sick of all 
this. They knew he wasn’t fitted to 
be a clerk in any of the depart- 
ments. Yet they wasted his time 
offering him important positions, 
as if the title would persuade him. 
Why? 

“We could outlaw your doll- 
making.” the Secretary said casu- 
ally. 

Brandon shrugged his shoulders. 
“Harmonics did that with my music 
writing, remember! I didn’t always 
do hand-carving.” 

The Secretary remembered. He 
had had an indirect hand in that.. 
It had been thought that if Bran- 
don was suddenly without income 
he might easily be persuaded to 
accept a position. They hadn’t 
counted on Brandon’s resourceful- 
ness, nor his stubborness. 

The thin man leaned back in his 
chair, looked again at the doll thing 
resting in one hand. The man was 
clever; there was a life-like quality 
to the doll. Brandon was an artist 
and it would be a shame to take 
him out of circulation. Yet what 
could he do? The President had 
insisted on the visit again this year, 

PUPPET GOVERNMENT 



knowing full well that Brandon 
would turn down the offer. 

Suddenly, the Secretary felt 
sorry for Brandon. The man was 
breaking down and didn’t realize 
it. His face was drawn and pale. 
He looked dog-tired. 

“Won’t you change your mind, 
Brandon?” the Secretary asked 
softly. “With Interior you will have 
an opportunity to get out into the 
sunlight. It will be a healthy life 
visiting the many conservations we 
have situated around the country; 
it will agree with you, I’m sure.” 

Brandon sighed. “I’m afraid, Mr. 
Secretary, that we are both wasting 
our time. I have a tremendous 
amount of paper work to finish be- 
fore midnight tonight and I am 
tired. I also have a few more in- 
terviews before I can get at it.” 
Brandon got up, “So if you don’t 
mind — ” 

The thin man looked at Bran- 
don searchingly. “Won’t you re- 
consider?” 

“I’m afraid not,” Brandon 
answered. 

The Secretary paused at the door. 
“See you next year, then!” 

“Next year,” Brandon answered 
flatly. 



T he secretary of interior 

hardly spoke to the young man 
waiting by his vehicle. He wanted 
to get away from there as soon as 
possible. These yearly visits to Bran- 
don always upset him, made him 
feel like a cad. It would be days be- 
fore he shook the unwanted feel- 
ing. 

“How did it go?” the young 

107 




man asked eagerly. 

The Secretary took in the young- 
ish face, the confidence flowing 
from the eyes. Evans always man- 
aged to give that youthful im- 
pression, yet he wasn’t really a 
young man. In a way the thin man 
envied Evans . with one ex- 
ception, of course. This would be 
Evan’s first visit to Brandon. Some 
of the confidence would be gone 
when he walked out of Brandon’s 
house. 

‘T said how did it go?” Evans 
repeated. 

The Secretary shrugged his thin 
shoulders. “As usual. He refused.” 

Evans showed white, even teeth. 
“Is he tired?” 

“Very.” 

“Excellent,” Evans said “And the 
paper work. Is it worrying him?” 

The thin man studied Evans. 
No, he didn’t envy the man any 
longer. Evans had no feelings; it 
was written on his face. “The paper 
work is worrying him to death.” 
he heard himself say. 

“Wonderful!” 

The Secretary became conscious 
of the small figure he was holding in 
his hand. He had walked out with 
one of Brandon’s creations! Sud- 
denly, he slammed it to the ground. 
The paint chipped and cracked. 
The small head rolled loosely across 
the lawn. Evans looked at him 
queerly. 

“I think you need a rest,” the 
young man said softly, unsmiling. 

“Brandon is a good man. I hate 
to see him broken. He has a lot of 
talent. But not for the work we’re 
offering him. It isn’t right, grinding 
him into the dirt the way we are.” 

108 



Evans leaned over, picked up the 
broken puppet. One arm was 
twisted at an odd angle, the clown 
suit was tom and dirty. Evans 
tried to fit the head back on the 
small body. Finally he succeeded. 

He looked at the Secretary of 
Interior. His eyes seemed different. 
“I have a position he can fill and 
do a good job. He won’t refuse. 
I’m sure.” Evans walked away, to- 
ward Brandon’s house, still holding 
the broken figure. 

Brandon stood on the veranda 
looking across his small estate, in 
the direction of the city. The site of 
the government was located there. 
Perhaps that was why he was so 
reluctant; he lived too close to it, 
had it around him day in and 
day out. The Government was 
ubiquitous, omnipresent and omni- 
potent. It dominated every con- 
versation, every business, every life 
from birth to death. Lately 
it even seemed that every one he 
came in contact with held a posi- 
tion with some agency connected 
with the government. 

“Mr. Brandon!” 

“I know,” he answered without 
turning. “You’re from Labor.” 
“We’ve never met!” 

Brandon turned and took in the 
lean individual who called him- 
self Evans. Quite different from 
the one who had called last year. 
That one had been old and grumpy. 
Brandon’s lips parted: “I assumed. 
All the other departments have 
been here except Revenue. I 
didn’t see Wilson standing out- 
side; I’ve heard he’s out of the 
country. That leaves you.” 

GEORGE REVELLE 




“You could have been wrong, 
you know.” Evans said. 

“How?’ Brandon asked without 
fully caring. 

“Revenue has been split. There 
are two departments now. Revenue 
and Taxation. Taxation handles 
income from taxpayers only.” 

“Big deal,” Brandons said 
harshly, remembering his desk 
piled high with papers. 

“They say you are a stubborn 
man, Brandon.” 

“Stubborn?” 

“Quite.” 

“Let’s say I’m content with my 
lot.” 

“Are you really, Brandon?” 

Brandon took in the young man’s 
wide shoulders, the face that was 
almost too young for such a re- 
sponsible position. For just an in- 
stant he had felt that this man 
would be different, that there might 
be a challenge here. He could see 
he was wrong. The man was going 
to offer him a position. 

“Let’s get to the point,” he said 
hurriedly. “I’m happy making pup- 
pets and I feel no need for a 
change.” 

“Fm glad you are happy, Mr. 
Brandon.” 

“Good. Then there is no need to 
continue. I refuse your offer.” 
Brandon was getting irritated. He 
didn’t wait for an answer, he 
walked past Evans, into the house. 

He stood by his desk. The pile of 
papers was still resting there, wait- 
ing for him. He had hoped, in some 
magical way, that they might have 
vanished. A foolish thought, he 
knew. 

“Income tax?” he heard Evans 



say from his shoulder. 

Brandon nodded wearily. Evans 
reached over and picked up a form. 
He frowned. “Complicated!” 
“Each year it gets worse,” Bran- 
don said listlessly. 

“I’ve never had to file one,” 
Evans said. 

Brandon lifted one eyebrow. 
“Government employees never 
do. We are paid a flat sum and our 
subsistance is taken care of. Cal- 
culators and computers adjust our 
salary each year in proportion to 
the expense of the government. We 
have been operating out of the red 
that way for years. It works out 
fine.” 

Brandon ran his hands through 
the papers and forms. Why then 
did he have to wade through this 
mess each year when it could be 
made so simple? He had been stag- 
gering under the load. 

“You’re an independent, Bran- 
don,” Evans said. “You stay in 
business for yourself because you 
dislike working for someone else. 
Isn’t that right?” 

“You might say that.” 

Evans dangled a handful of 
papers in front of Brandons’ brown 
eyes. “You are working for some- 
one else now. The tax department.” 
“Not exactly. I don’t have to 
answer to anyone.” 

Evans snorted. “Not even the tax 
collector?” 

“Not unless I make an error,” 
Brandon said stubbornly. ‘^And I 
won’t. I’m becoming an expert on 
this. When a man spends one hun- 
dred days a year working on these 
damn things he learns quite a bit. 
There will be no errors.” 



PUPPET GOVERNMENT 



109 




“One hundred days!” Evans 
laughed. “Soon it’ll be every day of 
the year. Then where will you be?” 
He looked directly into Brandon’s 
eyes. “Can’t you see? You’re in the 
web already, working a third of the 
year without compensation.” 

Evans pulled from his pocket the 
the broken puppet he had picked 
up from the driveway outside Bran- 
don’s house. He laid it in front of 
Brandon on the pile of income tax 
blanks. “Soon you’ll be without in- 
come; your business will deteriorate 
from lack of attention.” 

Brandon said nothing. 

Evans moved to the contour 
chair and sat down. He closed his 
eyes. “You’ve been out of circu- 
lation a long time, Brandon. The 
world is changing. Government is 
big business, one of the largest, and 
it’s expanding. We need more men, 
good men.” 

Evans opened his eyes and looked 
at the ceiling. “You said you’ve 
become an expert on forms. Would 
you consider taking a position as 
head of the tax department?” he 
asked abruptly. 

Brandon lifted his gaze from the 
desk. “I thought you were with 
labor?” 

“I could arrange it.” Evans 
closed his eyes again. 

“But • . 

“Think, Brandon. As chief of 
the bureau, you won’t have to 
answer to anyone, not even the 
President. You’ve seen the mess 
the forms have become. You can 
straighten it out.” 

“I don’t think . .” 

“I’ll have it put in writing that 
no one wiU bother you.” 

no 



Brandon stared at the papers on 
his desk. For the first time they 
were offering him a position he 
understood, one he could handle. It 
would be a challenge. He would be 
in a position to eliminate three- 
quarters of that damn paperwork. 
God knew how many like him- 
self were gradually getting snowed 
under each year. 

Brandon played with the puppet. 
The silly face stared back at him 
with a fixed, smiling expression. 
“Tell me, Evans,” he asked idly. 
“Why so much effort to locate me 
in a government position? I’ve 
had no special training; this is the 
first offer I’m even qualified 
enough to accept.” He lifted the 
puppet face high, gazed at its face. 
“For ten years I’ve been pestered.” 

Evans laughed as he pulled a 
sheet of paper from his pocket. 
“You have determination and will 
power. We need that type of nature 
th^e days more than ever.” Evans’ 
smile became wide “And you will 
be one less taxpayer we will have 
to worry about now. You’ll be on 
our side.” 

Evans pushed all the forms from 
Brandon’s desk with a sweep of his 
tanned hand. “Forget all of that, 
Brandon, forever. No more taxes 
for you. This is the last form you 
will have to sign. It appoints you 
Secretary of Taxation, carte 
blanche.” 

“You had all this prepared?” 
Brandon said in amazement. 

Evans’ smile grew wider. “We 
knew you couldn’t refuse an intel- 
ligent offer, one where you would 
be useful.” 

“We!” 



GEORGE REVELLE 




“The cabinet and myself.” 

Brandon picked up the pen, 
twisted it between his fingers. 
Evans was right, of course. He 
would be useful. Half those damn 
forms were filled with worthless 
nonsense that could easily be elimi- 
nated. Deductions should be 
higher; small, independent business 
should be given a break. And he 
could handle the job — that was 
important. 

“Just sign on the bottom line,” 
Evans said smoothly, pushing the 
broken puppet out of the way. 

The puppet fell to the floor and 
the head came off again. “Forget 
it,” Evans said quickly. 

Brandon studied the other man’s 
face before he reached over and 
picked up the little figure. It was 
a funny creature with a large, silly- 
looking balloon nose. Brandon han- 
dled it tenderly, looking at it 
thoughtfully. Finally he said: “My 
puppets. What happens to them?” 

“I don’t understand?” 

“Children enjoy them,” Brandon 
answered. 

“I’m afraid you don’t under- 
stand, Brandon,” Evans shook his 
head. “I’m offering you a full time 
position. You can make them — as 
a hobby of course — give them 
away, but you can’t sell them. 
That would give you an income 
again, mean more tax forms.” 

“But I couldn’t hope to pro- 
duce them for nothing,” Brandon 
insisted. “Not on a large scale, not 
on the fixed salary that you men- 
tioned!” 

“They aren’t important, Bran- 
don.” 

Brandon’s lips became a firm, 
PUPPET GOVERNMENT 



straight line. For the first time it 
was clear to him why he had been 
so reluctant to give up his work. 
His music had pleased people, just 
as his puppets were doing now. He 
was getting satisfaction out of his 
work. He was giving people some- 
thing no one else seemed to be 
able to give them. Accepting a po- 
sition he couldn’t handle, workmg 
for someone else had nothing to do 
with it . , . 

“I’ve changed my mind,” he said 
quietly. 

“Changed your mind?” Evans 
stared at the pen Brandon had 
carefully laid down on the desk; 
disbelief disfiguring his face. “You 
intend fighting that each year?” he 
pointed at the mad array of papers 
he had strewn at Brandon’s feet. 
“You’re willing to risk not having 
any time at all to work on your 
puppets against security and a life 
of ease?” 

“I’m willing,” Brandon an- 
swered. “Now I think you’d better 
leave Mr. , . 

“Evans!” 

“Mr. Evans. I might be able to 
finish these damn things before the 
midnight deadline.” 

Evans opened bis mouth but 
Brandon was already showing him 
the way to the door, shoving some- 
thing in his hand. 



VANS CLIMBED into his car 
and slumped down on the seat 
beside the President. He looked at 
the new puppet Brandon had 
forced into his hand before he 
could refuse. 

“Is Brandon Secretary of Taxa- 

111 





tion?” the President asked hope- 
fully. 

Evans shook his head from side 
to side. What had gone wrong? 
They had known Brandon was a 
stubborn man, that was why 
things were done as they were. The 
offering of worthless positions had 
been a feint. He should have 
grabbed at something he could 
handle. And the tax forms! That 
was supposed to be the last straw. 
They had been loaded, prepared 
just for Brandon, to break his re- 
sistence. Yet they had failed. Why? 

“Did he suspect?” The President 
eyed Evans. 

“I don’t think so. Sir.” Evans 
said. “I had the pen in his hand. 
He was ready to sign. Then some- 
thing went wrong. I can’t under- 
stand it!” 

The President looked the other 
way, found his eyes fastened on 
his own reflection on the window. 
The cabinet had been wrong think- 
ing it was a job for a psychologist 
like Evans. Brandon was an indi- 
vidual, a decided rarity in this day 
and age. 

“I’m glad,” the President said 
softly to the glass. 

“What was that. Sir?” 

The President turned. “I said, 
I’m glad he didn’t sign.” 

“You can’t mean that. Sir!” 

“But I do.” 

“Do you realize what this means? 
Brandon was the last taxpayer. 
We’ve been forced to operate an 
entire bureau just to process his 
forms. It’s the only department 
operating in the red. He’s the only 
person not employed by the gov- 
ernment, the only one still operat- 



ing a private business!” 

Evans found himself clenching 
the puppet tightly in his fist. “We 
will break him. I know we wiU. 
Next year it will take him 365 days 
to compute his tax. I promise.” 
“Next year,” the President said 
firmly, “Brandon will get a short 
form. One that he can complete in 
ten minutes. Do you understand, 
Evans?” 

Evans’ forehead creased. “I’m 
afraid — ” 

The President looked back at his 
reflection on the glass. “We don’t 
want to make the boss angry now, 
do we Evans?” 

“The boss, Sir?” 

“Brandon, of course,” the Presi- 
dent smiled. “After all, the govern- 
ment works for the taxpayers, 
Evans — and Brandon is the last 
taxpayer. He’s our boss, son. The 
only boss we have left.” 

“Mr. President. If I might — ” 
The President returned his gaze 
to Evans. “I think we’ve forgotten 
something over these past years, 
Evans. Something very important.” 
“What is that, Sir?” 

The President removed the pup- 
pet from Evans’ limp fingers. “If 
the sole puipose of the government 
is to serve the taxpayers — and there 
were no more — how could we justi- 
fy our existence in office?” 

The President ran his finger un- 
der the chin of the little puppet, 
“Do you mind if I keep this, 
Evans?” he asked softly. “I’d like 
to take it home to my granddaugh- 
ter. She’s never seen a puppet, I’m 
sure she’ll love it.” 

The tiny figure seemed to smile 
approvingly. END

A revolution in astronomy, second 
only to the invention of the tele- 
scope itself, is foreseen in electronic 
devices called image converters. 
These tubes, now being tested by 
the Farnsworth Electronic Cor- 
poration and R.C.A., promise to 
increase ten-fold the power of in- 
struments in present use. They will 
also boost by an equivalent amount 
the light-gathering use of all tele- 
scopes to which they are attached. 
Image converters change light to 
electrons, greatly multiply the num- 
ber of electrons, then change the 
tiny negative particles back into 
light again; the light, much intensi- 
fied, falls on a photographic plate. 
Routine use of these converters for 
photographing the heavens may 
bring discoveries which will require 
Mankind to reconsider the universe, 
as Einstein’s theory once did. 

A ^'five-year plan"' for a manned 
rocket ship which will cross half 
the continent in 20 minutes is now 
in the drawing board stage. Dubbed 
the Griffon, &e ship would carry a 
light-weight pilot, not over 150 
pounds, weigh more than 65,000 
pounds at take-off, and shoot 75 
miles up into space in about five 
seconds. Then it would level off, 
reenter the atmosphere, and glide 



the rest of the way to its destina- 
tion. The Griffon would have pro- 
visions for control either by the 
pilot or by ground stations. If the 
pilot lost consciousness at any time 
during flight, small auto-control 
systems would take over until he 
recovered. These could be similar 
to the units developed for V-2 
rockets. The motor would use a 
combination of gasoline and liquid 
oxygen for fuel; and since the liquid 
oxygen would be kept at 300 de- 
grees below zero Fahrenheit, some 
of it could be used to keep the ship 
cool. The ship would be able to 
land at present day airports and 
would have a landing speed of 
about 150 miles per hour. 

Middle East oil may be towed to its 
buyers in giant “sausage skins” 
holding 9,000 tons when the gov- 
ernment-backed experiments of two 
Cambridge University engineers 
are completed. The hope of the 
developers is that the nylon oil 
barges, nicknamed Nobs, will solve 
the current oil tanker shortage. 
The plan is to make an inner con- 
tainer of nylon, covered by a plas- 
tic skin, one-quarter to one-half an 
inch thick. The completed “sau- 
sage skin” tanker, 60 feet long and 
weighing 20 tons empty, could then 
be flown or shipped to the oil port 
and rolled around a drum. When 
full of crude oil, the Nob would 
be four-fifths submerged and could 
be towed by a loaded tanker or tug 
at 10 to 15 knots in normal weather 
conditions. With a tug at each end, 
it might be possible to guide one 
through the Suez Canal. The in- 
ventors are confident that the bul- 




let-proof Nob would just bounce 
off if it were to hit a rock or dock 
wall at the suggested speeds. 

In the near future you may be go- 
ing to the doctor to get a periodic 
fever for immunization against in- 
fluenza-type diseases. Recent studies 
have shown that the danger factor 
is only a small element in the virus 
and it can emerge only through a 
tiny “escape hatch” in the lining 
that surrounds the virus. Armed 
with this knowledge of the struc- 
ture of the virus, biophysicists think 
it will be possible to alter the dis- 
ease carriers and so render them 
harmless. This in turn could lead 
to radically difTerent methods of 
immunization, such as using dia- 
thermal machines to create arti- 
ficial fevers in people that will 
leave them immune to diseases 
caused by viruses. 

A space ship that can be made 
cheaply with the know-how and 
materials on hand was described 
at a recent Rocket Society meeting. 
Called the “Snooper” by the de- 
signers, the ship is a non-return, 
robot rocket propelled by ions, 
armed with television, radar, com- 
munications equipment and auxil- 
liary power supply systems. Since 
the propulsion system obtains its 
thrust by the electrical acceleration 
of ionized gases to extremely high 
velocities (657,000 feet per second), 
a nuclear reactor is used to pro- 
duce the electrical field necessary 
to accelerate the ions. The reactor 
would also supply power for the 
three-quarters of a ton of instru- 
ments to be carried by the vehicle. 

114 



The Snooper would look somewhat 
like a giant moth with wings 
spreading out for 66 feet from the 
back end. The wings would dissi- 
pate the excess heat generated by 
the nuclear reactor. The designers 
propose lifting the ion rocket into 
an orbit around the earth by 
chemical fuels similar to those 
suggested for an intercontinental 
ballistics missile. After Snooper 
reaches the orbit, the wings are 
spread and the instrument section 
is extended far forward of the re- 
actor to avoid radiation damage. 

An ultrahigh speed camera that 
can take pictures at a rate of 
4,000,000 per second has been per- 
fected by Precision Technology, 
Inc., Livermore, California. An 
especially designed electronic tube 
called an image converter is the 
heart of the camera. The tube 
picks up light images by means of a 
photosensitive cathode at one end. 
These images are then transferred 
electronically to a viewing screen 
at the other end, where the picture 
is recorded on film. By using ex- 
tremely short electrical pulses, 
the tube can be turned on and off 
again almost instantaneously. The 
tube and the accompanying elec- 
tronic circuits act both as the cam- 
era’s shutter and as its means for 
moving images across the face of 
the stationary recording film. As 
many as five exposures can be 
made on a single plate of film with 
exposure times as short as 20 milli- 
microseconds or less than one-fif- 
tieth of a millionth of a second. 

Army recruits may soon be receiv-

ing their shots from a spray gun 
instead of a hypodermic needle. 
The automatic jet injection syringe 
uses a high-spe^ spray that takes 
less than a second to penetrate the 
tissue beneath the skin. The hand- 
held gun is powered by a small 
hydraulic pump, connected to it by 
a rubber hose, and can be fired 
continuously until the vaccine bot- 
tle sitting at the back of the gun is 
empty. The gun can be cocked and 
reloaded in a matter of six seconds 
and no sterilization is needed be- 
tween injections, since the tip of 
the injector nozzle does not actual- 
ly touch the skin. The jet velocity 
of the vaccine is 700 feet per sec- 
ond when it comes out of the noz- 
zle and, though not always pain- 
less, it causes less discomfort than 
hypodermic needles. 

Jet plones moy soon be given a 
100-mile-per-hour boost through 
the use of an alloy that would in- 
crease operating temperatures in 
jet engines about 100 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Developed by the West- 
inghouse Electric Corporation, the 
metal, an alloy of iron, nickel, 
chromium, molybdenum, titanium 
and boron was designed to help 
push back what is called the “sec- 
ond heat barrier” being met by 
supersonic planes. This heating oc- 
curs in the engine, where white-hot 
gases from the burning fuel push 
against turbine blades. Since a jet 
engine gets its operating energy by 
increasing the temperature of the 
air passing through it, the greater 
the air temperature increase the 
more thrust a given engine will 
produce and the faster the plane 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 



will fly. The alloy is intended as a 
structural material for use in the 
jet’s turbine section, and will en- 
able the operation of jet engines to 
be increased to temperatures much 
higher than are now possible. 

Window panes and lenses of metal 
have been developed by the Ray- 
thoen Manufacturing Company 
which allows invisible heat rays 
from sub-zero targets to reach a 
supersensitive infrared detector. 
Made of a silicon material, these 
new optical parts may make it pos- 
sible to detect enemy ships, planes 
and missiles from longer distances 
in total darkness without revealing 
the observer’s position. By “seeing” 
colder objects, a plane equipped 
with an infrared detector could 
sense the relatively “cold” parts of 
a target craft like the nose and the 
wing sections, as well as the warm 
parts such as the engines. Such sys- 
tems would be silent and would not 
broadcast signals revealing their 
positions. 

The Army's packoge power reactor 
has recently begun operation. It 
is the first of a new bre^ of atomic 
power plants that can be trans- 
ported by air to remote sites, there 
to operate reliably for long periods 
without new fuel. The present 
pioneer plant can generate approxi- 
mately 2,000 kilowatts of electricity. 
Installed in isolated bases in the 
Arctic and Antarctic, such plants 
will also be able to supply steam 
for heating as a by-product. The 
power package reactor is expected 
to be as important to land outposts 
as the atomic submarine.

Sirs: 

In nearly every science fiction 
story I have ever read, in If and 
other magazines, there is one great 
glaring anachronism : Man. 

The century may be the 25th or 
the 30th. Earth is either blooming 
like a garden spot, and out exploit- 
ing all the other planets; or Earth 
is withering away, a victim of 
atomic wars or simply too many 
hydrogen bomb tests. But has Man 
changed since the 20th century? 
Not a whit. 

If science is going to save the 
world from itself, the saucers, the 
inter-galaxy border disputes, and if 
we are all going to work a ten hour 
week and the Welfare departments 
are going to take care of us all, it 
seems inevitable that Man is going 
to change a great deal in the proc- 
ess. Not only will he grow fatter, 
taller, blonder, cleaner and con- 
ceivably dumber, he is going to 



have an entirely different batch of 
pressures and react in totally dif- 
ferent ways. But does this happen 
in science fiction stories? No! 

Among the sciences, that of 
gadgetry is the only one, and while 
its present-day advance is more ob- 
vious (and more frightful) than 
others, the social sciences are gain- 
ing too, and it is certain that the 
children growing up are a different 
breed of cats than their still de- 
pression-and-war-haunted parents. 
And their children are going to be 
even more strange, unless there are 
more depressions and wars to re- 
condition them to attitudes resem- 
bling those of present-day adults. 

If Man is going to triumph over 
his environment. Mars and the 
saucers, he will probably lose what 
is presently one of his few endear- 
ing traits: his humility. If a man 
with humility and all its attendant 
virtues survives (to be the hero of 
a science fiction story) his back- 
ground will need to be utterly un- 
usual. But this is never pointed out 
in a science fiction story: the boy 
scout hero who knocks out the bad 
guy is a '‘normal” man for his cen- 
tury. And for that matter, how did 
the bad guy get there? Because the 
homogeneity presently considered so 
desirable will prevent his develop- 
ment too. If the sociologists get 
their way, the world of tomorrow is 
going to be one sans hero or villain, 
in which everybody works for a pa- 
ternal government or corporation, 
and looks and thinks and talks just 
like everybody else. 

Something on which nearly all 
the writers of the genre agree is 
that tomorrow is going to be singu- 

HUE AND CRY 



116 




buiy humorless. All joke-crackers 
are, per se, suspect and looked 
upon as a 20th century anacluro- 
nism. Presently, it is true, a joke 
teller is barred from serious office- 
holding, but must we look upon 
this as an irreversible trend? Must 
we assume that we will never have 
another Mencken, and that the 
gathering clouds of grimness are 
never going to be cleared away? 
Man’s laughter — and Man has 
been in some pretty tough spots — 
echoes down through the centuries; 
I think that science fiction writers 
condemn humor forever on too lit- 
tle evidence. 

But then let us consider the 
stories in which Man has lost. He 
has polluted his own planet with 
radioactivity, and little Noah-like 
figures are seen departing in rattle- 
trap rockets. But he still hasn’t 
changed at all. With a stiff upper 
lip and a 20th century dignity, he 
blasts off to another planet, there, 
we may assume, to carry on just as 
before. 

Here I think the writers err on 
the side of optimism. If Man is 
content to let his planet be de- 
stroyed, and by nobody but him- 
self, we may feel safe in concluding 
that he will then be so lethargic, 
so corrupted and possibly so plain 
disinterested, that an end to every- 
thing will be the only solution. 
Perhfip he will even retain a little 
humihty in this case, and realize 
that so cantankerous a beast as 
Man has no business destroying 
more than one planet. 

The writers also seem to be un- 
inventive in the matter of govern- 
mental forms. They seem to believe 

HUE AND CRY 



that there is no choice except pres- 
ent-day democracy or one or an- 
other form of dictatorship ; but 
both of these are fairly recent in- 
ventions and it doesn’t seem pos- 
sible that Man, who so dearly loves 
to invent things, isn’t going to 
come up with more variations on 
the theme. It’s interesting to note 
that the higher forms oi govern- 
ment that the aliens always talk 
about so evasively are possible only 
because the aliens are so highly de- 
veloped that they don’t need any 
governing. But no matter how far 
mto tomorrow a writer looks, he 
never seems to think that such 
things can develope here. Man with 
all his foibles, so prone to err, and 
consequently so lovable, is always 
let off because of a sentimental 
pang on the part of the visiting 
aliens; for even the aliens have 
20th century humanoid weaknesses. 

As Thurber says, “The proper 
study of Mankind is Man, says 
Man.”

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

Having just finished James 
Gunn’s GREEN THUMB in the 
April issue, I find that I cannot 
agree with his contention that 
“chance rules the universe”. While 
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle 
does set an “unsuspected limit on 
the accuracy with which we can de- 
scribe physical situations” does this 
not apply solely on the subatomic 
level? My own reading and think- 
ing (as a sociologist) on the subject 
has led me to accept Korzybski’s 

117 




conclusion that the uncertainty 
principle does not abolish determin- 
ism, but rather it “requires the 
transforming of the two-valued 
Aristotelian logic into the infinity- 
valued semantics of probability”. 

In other words, “free will” is still 
a legal, moral and cultural fiction 
(whether useful or otherwise) and 
science has not yet reached the end 
of the road, simply because inde- 
terminism on the subatomic level 
does not necessitate indeterminism 
oVany other level. I would have 
liked to see the story end with 
Gunn’s “universal genius”, who 
should have known better, straight- 
ening out the overspecialized physi- 
cist on the full implications and 
limitations of the Heisenberg prin- 
ciple. 

Sincerely, 

— Edd Doerr

Sirs: 

An invasion of Earth by Mar- 
tians used as a plot for a radio 
play once threw thousands of peo- 
ple into a panic. They tuned in 
after the play had started and mis- 
took fiction for fact. The police 
were inundated with phone calls 
from all parts of the state from 
terrified people supposedly in the 
path of the advancing men from 
Mars. 

The idea was not new. Holly- 
wood producers and writers of 
space fiction have often used the 
same format. In fiction, the Earth 
peoples have always been the vic- 
tims of the grotesque, super-scien- 
tific beings with vast ant-like heads 

118 



and antenna-like limbs who in- 
vaded the Earth with the intention* 
of conquering and enslaving its 
people. 

The truth could be just the re- 
verse. If Martians and Venusians 
exist, and modern astronomy sug- 
gests there may be millions of in- 
habitable planets, then THEY will 
be contemplating our well advanced 
plans for moon flight and explora- 
tion with a sense of impending 
catastrophe. If and when we master 
the mysteries and hazards of space 
travel, and begin to wander through 
the trackless vastnesses of galactic 
space in our space ships and rock- 
ets, what would be the result? 

We named Mai's the Planet of 
War for no other reason than the 
fact that it was red. Its redness was 
innocent enough. It is only the re- 
sult of great swirling clouds of dust 
that constantly sweep over its arid 
plains and deserts. If Earth were 
called the Planet of War it could 
be so named with far more signifi- 
cance. If peace loving peoples exist 
on other worlds than our own, how 
would Earth history read to them? 
They would not need to go back 
500 years, or even 50; five years or 
even five months would be enough. 
What would they think of the 
butchery of Budapest? Of the cries 
of the ill-fated Jews of Brodnow as 
the open box-cars of the death 
freights rumbles through the freez- 
ing night toward Siberia? Or of 
Belsen and Dachau? What of the 
horror and mortal agonies of Lon- 
don and Coventry as they were 
reduced to shambles in World War 
II? 

In World War I, the scarlet 
HUE AND CRY 




Flanders Poppies spread a carpet 
of crimson loveliness over the 
gashes and scars of war; but in 
World War II, the sons of those 
quietly sleeping beneath the ground 
had to drive their lumbering tanks 
over the same battlefields and tear 
them open again. 

What of the seven little Viet- 
namese boys fleeing from the Com- 
munists, who, led by their tongue- 
less teacher, came staggering out 
of the forest with chopsticks 
which had been driven through 
their eardrums still protruding 
from their heads? If there are 
dwellers on mighty Betelgeuse, 
what would their reaction be to the 
hungry children prowling like tim- 
ber wolves among the ruins of 
bombed cities in the tragic after- 
math of war? 

In the not-too-distant future we 
expect to be able to project some 
kind of missile onto the lunar sur- 
face. We may be ready scientifically 
for the great adventure into space; 
but are we ready morally? 

Maybe the blinding glares of our 
atomic explosions flashed a warn- 
ing understood by distant watching 
eyes, like the glowing campfires in 
the vanguard of an invader. The 
deepest apprehension would fill the 



hearts of any intelligent beings at 
the prospect of being indoctrinated 
into Earth practices in this 20th 
century. The Kefauver Committee 
indicates that drug addicts from 12 
to 20 years old will pay more than 
one billion dollars for marijuana, 
heroin and other life-wrecking 
drugs this year. In the same period, 
to raise this huge fortune thou- 
sands of major crimes will be com- 
mitted ranging from armed rob- 
bery to murder. 

Man stands at the most awe- 
inspiring moment in his arduous 
climb from stone age to science. At 
long last he has raised his sights to 
the stars. Now is the time for Homo 
Sapiens to pause, take stock, clean 
house. He knows the Golden Rule, 
now is the time for him to apply 
its medication to the open sores 
of the world’s wounds. 

Let him learn to beat his swords 
into ploughshares and his spears 
into pruning hooks, then instead 
of spreading consternation from 
Rigel to the one trillion galaxies in 
the bowl of the Big Dipper, he will 
come as a welcome ambassador 
bringing tidings of peace.

Kramvit felt himself being 
lowered towards the stage. He was 
helped out of the booth by the 
young ladies, and escorted to the 
M.C. No trumpets, now. The audi- 
ence was silent as the M.C. thanked 
Kramvit, and told him how 
honored he was to be the first to 
welcome the first visitor from an- 
other planet on V.C. He also told 
him how sorry he was that Kram- 
vit had lost. 

Kramvit walked off stage while 
the audience applauded. 

. “The funny thing is, I 
really knew the answer,” Kramvit 



was saying to Carrowick, with a 
sheepish grin. “I was just so nerv- 
ous. I’m not accustomed to this 
at all.” 

“Well,” said Carrowick, “it’s 
nothing to worry about. As I said, 
it was just a good wiU appear- 
ance.” 

They were leaving the studio, 
when a young man in uniform 
approached Kramvit. 

“Excuse me, sir, a Phonogram 
for you.” 

Kramvit looked at the envelope 
and saw that it was from the High 
Council of Six. He turned the 
envelope over and read the name. 

It was addressed to, “Poor Mr.
