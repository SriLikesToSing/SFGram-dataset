Directions: 

Re: Directions in the May '73 is- 
sue — this man , Dave Wise, must 
look upon rhinestones with shud- 
dering disaste, wondering in his 
high-falutin heart of hearts how 
come they come to be, since 
nothing less than diamonds have 
any right to be. 

I am simply weary up to my 
cerebral cortex of pseudo- intellect- 
ualism as practiced by people who 
put on a posture of denying ordi- 
nariness, which is the state in which 
most of us exist. 

We are not moronic because our 
depths are seldom plumbed by 
eight hours a day of earning our 
living at desks covered with paper, 
at machines making other ma- 
chines, at cash registers, typewrit- 
ers or gas pumps, in trucks, taxis 
and bulldozers, and so on. The 
depths are there, to be called on 
when the occasion warrants, and 
most of us in this country are well 
enough educated to understand the 
truly great works of social signifi- 
cance, but we are not so constituted 
as to seek surcease from our daily 
treadmills in the unrelieved perusal 
of tales of intolerance, inhumanity, 



greed, revenge, irresponsibility in 
high places and all the other moral 
shortcomings of man. We know 
only too well that they exist. 

Rhinestones are very pretty on 
the gal who works all day, for 
instance, as a grocery checker. She 
may also enjoy reading Gordon 
Dickson' s Dorsai stories, Andre 
Norton's witch series, E. C. Tubbs' 
Dumerest stories, Anne McCaf- 
frey's dragon tales, et al. She is 
happy with one- dimensional char- 
acterizations as long as they are 
larger than life in nobility and de- 
termination to change a world ( or 
even a universe) situation for the 
better. She is grateful for the 
imagination and ability of the 
authors who entertain her. She 
knows about Dickens, Joyce and 
Melville, but a few pages of Dic- 
kens, Joyce or Melville are not 
conducive to relaxation after eight 
hours on her feet slinging groceries 
around. Intolerance and insensi- 
tivity glare at her all day; she does 
not want them in her dreams. 

Science fiction need not aspire to 
be a creative field in parallel signifi- 
cance to the works of Dostoievsky, 
Plato, Chekov, Mann, Dante and 
the aforementioned Dickens, Joyce 
and Melville. Science fiction is 
doing a tremendous service as is, 
and it will be beloved by more and 
more thousands of ordinary daily- 
bread people, though they may not 
be articulate about it. 

Rhinestones and science fiction 
are a hell of a combination to make 
life bearable at ninety bucks a week 
and contact with the daily news.

INVERTED WORLD 

CHRISTOPHER PRIEST

I 

I HAD reached the age of six hun- 
dred and fifty miles. Beyond the 
door the guildsmen were assembling 
for the ceremony in which I would 
be admitted as a guild apprentice. It 
was a moment of excitement and 
apprehension, a concentration into a 
few minutes of all that my life had 
been until then. 

My father was a guildsman and I 
had always seen his life from a 
certain remove. I regarded it as an 
enthralling existence, charged with 
purpose, ceremony and responsi- 
bility— he told me nothing of his life 
or work, but his uniform, his vague 
manner and his frequent absences 
from the city hinted at a preoccupa- 
tion with matters of utmost impor- 
tance. 

Within a few minutes the way 
would be open for me to join that 
life. It was an honor and a donning 
of responsibility and no boy who had 
grown up inside the confining walls 
of the creche could fail to respond to 
the thrill of this major step. 

The creche itself was a small build- 
ing at the very south of the city. It 
was almost totally enclosed— a 
warren of corridors, rooms and halls. 
There was no access to the rest of the 
city, except by way of a door that 
was normally locked, and the only 
opportunities for exercise existed in 
the small gymnasium and a tiny open 
space, bounded on all four sides by 
high walls. 

Like the other children I had been 



placed in the charge of the creche 
administrators soon after my birth 
and knew no other world. I had no 
memories of my mother— she had left 
the city soon after my birth. 

It had been a dull but not un- 
happy experience. I had made some 
good friends and one of them— a boy 
a few miles older than I called 
Gelman Jase— had become an appren- 
tice guildsman a short time before 
me. I was looking forward to seeing 
Jase again. I had seen him once since 
his coming of age, when he returned 
briefly to the creche, and already he 
had adopted the slightly preoccupied 
manner of the guildsmen and I had 
learned nothing from him. Now that 
I, too, was about to become an 
apprentice I felt that he would have 
much to tell me. 

The administrator returned to the 
anteroom where I was standing. 

“They’re ready,” he said. “Can 
you remember what you have to 
do?” 

“Yes.” 

“Good luck.” 

I discovered that I was trembling 
and the palms of my hands were 
moist. The administrator, who had 
brought me from the creche that 
morning, grinned at me in sympathy. 
He thought he understood the ordeal 
I was suffering, but he knew, lit- 
erally, only half of it. 

After the guild ceremony more 
was in store for me. My father had 
told me that he had arranged a 
marriage for me. I had taken the 
news calmly because I knew that 



8 



GALAXY 




guildsmen were expected to marry 
early and I already knew the chosen 
girl. She was Victoria Lerouex and 
she and I had grown up together in 
the creche. I had not had much to do 
with her— there were not many girls 
in the creche and they tended to 
keep together in a tight-knit group— 
but we were less than strangers. Even 
so, the notion of being married was a 
new one and I had not had much 
time to prepare myself mentally for 
it. 

The administrator glanced up at 
the clock. 

“Okay, Helward. It’s time.” 

We shook hands briefly and he 
opened the door. He walked into the 
hall, leaving the door open. Through 
it I could see several of the guildsmen 
standing on the main floor. The 
ceiling lights were on. 

The administrator stopped just be- 
yond the door and turned to address 
the platform. 

“My Lord Navigator. I seek 
audience.” 

“Identify yourself.” A distant 
voice. From where I was standing in 
the anteroom I could not see the 
speaker. 

“I am Domestic Administrator 
Bruch. At the command of my chief 
administrator I have summoned one 
Helward Mann, who seeks appren- 
ticeship in a guild of the first order.” 

“I recognize you, Bruch. You may 
admit the apprentice.” 

Bruch turned and faced me and, as 
he had earlier rehearsed me, I 
stepped forward into the hall. In the 



center of the floor a small podium 
had been placed and I walked over 
and took up position behind it. 

I faced the platform. 

I N THE concentrated brilliance of 
the spotlights sat an elderly man 
in a high-backed chair. He was wear- 
ing a black cloak decorated with a 
circle of white stitched on the breast. 
On each side of him stood three men, 
all wearing cloaks, but each of these 
was decorated with a sash of a 
different color. Gathered on the 
main floor of the hall, in front of the 
platform, were several other men and 
a few women. My father was among 
them. 

Everyone was looking at me and I 
felt my nervousness increase. My 
mind went blank and all Bruch’s 
careful rehearsals were forgotten. 

In the silence that followed my 
entrance I stared straight ahead at 
the man sitting at the center of the 
platform. This was the first time I 
had even seen— let alone been in the 
company of— a Navigator. In my im- 
mediate background of the creche 
such men had sometimes been 
spoken of in a deferential way, some- 
times— by the more disrespectful— in 
a derisive way, but always with 
undertones of awe for the almost 
legendary figures. That one was here 
at all only underlined the importance 
of this ceremony. My immediate 
thought was that what a story this 
would be to tell the others— and then 
I remembered that from this day 
nothing would be the same again.

Bruch had stepped forward to face 
me. 

“Are you Helward Mann, sir?” 
“Yes, I am.” 

“What age have you attained, sir?” 
“Six hundred and fifty miles.” 
“Are you aware of the significance 
of this age?” 

“I assume the responsibilities of an 
adult.” 

“How best can you assume those 
responsibilities, sir?” 

“I wish to enter apprenticeship 
with a first-order guild of my 
choice.” 

“Have you made that choice, sir?” 
“Yes, I have.” 

Bruch turned and addressed the 
platform. He repeated the content of 
my answers to the men assembled 
there, though it seemed to me that 
they must have been able to hear my 
answers as I gave them. 

“Does anyone wish to question 
the apprentice?” said the Navigator 
to the other men on the platform. 

No one replied. 

“Very well.” The Navigator stood 
up. “Come forward, Helward Mann, 
and stand where I can see you.” 
Bruch stepped to one side. I left 
the podium and walked forward to 
where a small white plastic circle had 
been inlaid into the carpet. I stopped 
with my feet in the center of it. For 
several seconds I was regarded in 
silence. 

The Navigator turned to one of 
the men at his side. 

“Do we have the proposers here?” 
“Yes, My Lord.” 



“Very well. As this is a guild 
matter we must exclude all others.” 
The Navigator sat down and the 
man immediately to his right stepped 
forward. 

“Is there any man here who does 
not rank with the first order? If so, 
he will grace us with his absence.” 
Slightly behind me, and to one 
side of me, I noticed Bruch make a 
slight bow toward the platform. 
Then he left the hall. He was not 
alone. Of the group of people on the 
main floor of the hall, about a half 
left the room by one or other of the 
exits. Those remaining turned to face 
me. 

66 T\0 WE recognize strangers?” 
X-Jsaid the man on the platform. 
There was silence. “Apprentice Hel- 
ward Mann, you are now in the 
exclusive company of first-order 
guildsmen. A gathering such as this is 
not common in the city and you 
should treat it with appropriate so- 
lemnity. It is in your honor. When 
you have passed through your ap- 
prenticeship these people will be 
your peers and you will be bound, 
just as they are, by guild rules. Is that 
understood?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“You have selected the guild you 
wish to enter. Please name it for all 
to hear.” 

“I wish to become a Future Sur- 
veyor,” I said. 

“Very well, that is acceptable. I 
am Future Surveyor Clausewitz and I 
am your chief guildsman. Standing 



10 



GALAXY 




around you are other Future Sur- 
veyors, as well as representatives 
from other first-order guilds. Here on 
the platform are the other chief 
guildsmen of the first order. In the 
center, we are honored by the pres- 
ence of Lord Navigator Olsson.” 

As Bruch had earlier rehearsed me 
I made a deep bow toward the 
Navigator. The bow was all I now 
remembered of his instructions— he 
had told me that he knew nothing of 
the details of this part of the cere- 
mony, only that I should display 
appropriate respect toward the Navi- 
gator when formally introduced to 
him. 

“Do we have a proposer for the 
apprentice?” 

“Sire, I wish to propose him.” It 
was my father who spoke. 

“Future Surveyor Mann has pro- 
posed. Do we have a seconder?” 

“Sir, I will second the proposal.” 
“Bridge-builder Lerouex has sec- 
onded. Do we hear any dissent?” 
There was a long silence. Twice 
more Clausewitz called for dissent, 
but no one raised any objection to 
me. 

“That is as it should be,” said 
Clausewitz. “Helward Mann, I now 
offer you the oath of a first-order 
guild. You may— even at this late 
stage— decline to take it. If, however, 
you do swear to the oath you will be 
bound to it for the whole of the rest 
of your life in the city. The penalty 
for breaching the oath is summary 
execution. Is that absolutely clear in 
your mind?” 



I was stunned by this. Nothing 
anyone had said— my father, Jase or 
even Bruch— had warned me of it. 
Perhaps Bruch had not known . 
but surely my father would have told 
me? 

“Well?” 

“Do I have to decide now, sir?” 

“Yes.” 

It was quite clear that I would not 
be allowed to know the oath before 
deciding. Its content was no doubt 
absolutely vital to the secrecy. I felt 
that I had very little alternative. I 
had come this far and already I could 
feel the pressures of the system 
about me. To proceed as far as 
this— proposal and acceptance— and 
then to decline the oath was im- 
possible, or so it seemed to me at 
that moment. 

“I will take the oath, sir.” 

Clausewitz stepped down from the 
platform, walked over to me and 
handed me a piece of white card. 

“Read this clearly and loudly,” he 
told me. “You may read it through 
to yourself first if you wish, but if 
you do so you will be immediately 
bound by it.” 

I nodded to show my understand- 
ing of this and he returned to the 
stage. The Navigator stood up. I read 
the oath silently, familiarizing myself 
with its phrases. 

I faced the platform, aware of the 
attention of the others on me, not 
least that of my father. 

“I, Helward Mann, being a respon- 
sible adult and a citizen of Earth do 
solemnly swear: 



INVERTED WORLD 



11 




“That as an apprentice to the guild 
of Future Surveyors I shall discharge 
whatever tasks I am given with the 
utmost effort; 

“That I shall place the security of 
the city of Earth above all other 
concerns; 

“That I shall discuss the affairs of 
my guild and other first-order guilds 
with no one who is not himself an 
accredited and sworn apprentice or a 
first-order guildsman; 

“That whatsoever I shall experi- 
ence or see of the world beyond the 
city of Earth will be considered a 
matter of guild security; 

“That on acceptance as a full 
guildsman I shall apprise myself of 
the contents of the document known 
as Destaine’s Directive, and that I 
shall make it my duty to obey its 
instructions, and that further I shall 
pass on the knowledge obtained from 
it to future generations of guildsmen; 

“That the swearing of this oath 
shall be considered a matter of guild 
security. 

“All this is sworn in the full 
knowledge that a betrayal of any one 
of these conditions shall lead to my 
summary death at the hands of my 
fellow guildsmen.” 

I LOOKED up at Clausewitz as I 
finished speaking. The very act of 
reading those words had filled me 
with an excitement I could hardly 
contain. Beyond the city . That 
meant I would leave the city, venture 
as an apprentice into the very regions 
which had been forbidden to me and 



were even yet forbidden to most of 
those in the city. The creche was full 
of rumors about what lay outside the 
city and already I had any number of 
wild imaginings about it. I was sen- 
sible enough to realize that the real- 
ity could never equal those rumors 
for inventiveness, but even so the 
prospect was one that dazzled and 
appalled me. The cloak of secrecy 
that the guildsmen placed around it 
seemed to imply that something 
dreadful was beyond the walls of the 
city— so dreadful that a penalty of 
death was the price paid for revealing 
its nature. 

Clausewitz said: “Step up to the 
platform, Apprentice Mann.” 

I walked forward, climbing the 
four steps that led up to the stage. 
Clausewitz greeted me, shaking me 
by the hand and taking away from 
me the card with the oath. I was 
introduced first to the Navigator, 
who spoke a few amiable words to 
me, and then to the other chief 
guildsmen. Clausewitz told me not 
only their names but also their titles, 
some of which were new to me. I was 
beginning to feel overwhelmed by all 
the information. I was learning 
in a few moments as much as I had 
learned inside the creche in all my 
life to date. 

There were six first-order guilds. 
In addition to Clausewitz’s Future 
Surveyors guild there was a guild 
responsible for Traction, another for 
Track -laying and another for Bridge- 
building. I was told that these were 
the guilds primarily responsible for 



12 



GALAXY 




the administration of the city’s con- 
tinued existence. In support of these 
were two further guilds: Militia and 
Barter. All this was new to me, but 
now I recalled that my father had 
sometimes referred in passing to men 
who bore as titles the names of their 
guilds. I had heard of the Bridge- 
builders, for instance, but until this 
ceremony I had had no conception 
that the building of a bridge was an 
event surrounded by an aura of ritual 
and secrecy. How was a bridge funda- 
mental to the city’s survival? Why 
was a militia necessary? 

Indeed, what was the future? 

I WAS taken by Clausewitz to meet 
the Future guildsmen, among 
them of course my father. Only 
three were present— the rest, I was 
told, were away from the city. With 
these introductions finished I spoke 
to the other guildsmen, there being 
at least one representative from each 
of the first-order guilds. I was gaining 
the impression that the work of a 
guildsman outside the city was a 
major occupier of time and re- 
sources. On several occasions one or 
another of the guildsmen would apol- 
ogize for there being no more of 
their number at the ceremony. They 
were away from the city. 

During these conversations one un- 
usual fact struck me. It was some- 
thing that I had noticed earlier, but 
had not registered consciously. This 
was that my father and the other 
Future guildsmen appeared to be

piece STAND ON ZANZIBAR. 
A smash hit in its high-priced 
hardcover edition and a selection 
of the Science Fiction Book Club, 
THE SHEEP LOOK UP is sure to 
be a sell-out as a Ballantine 
paperback. In a brilliant and 
savage attack on our suicidal 
complacency in the face of an 
undeniable truth— we are killing 
our planet— Brunner tells of the 
people who live on the Earth and 
their attempts to come to terms 
with their environment. This is the 
book the whole sf world is sure to 
be talking about. 

Philip Jose Farmer is one of the 
most imaginative practitioners of 
the craft around today. No one 
ever knows quite what to expect 
when picking up a new Farmer 
title. But everyone knows one is 
about to read something differ- 
ent — and fun! TRAITOR TO THE 
LIVING is Farmer’s bright new 
book for us. Here the medium isn’t 
the message; MEDIUM is a ma- 
chine— a machine designed to 
provide a connection with the 
dead. At a price, of course! That 
is, if it works. And what if the 
messages picked up are not from 
the dead but from aliens? An 
interesting political problem de- 
velops, pulling us along on Farm- 
er’s crazy adventure. BB 



considerably older than the others. 
Clausewitz himself was strongly built 
and he stood magnificent in his 
cloak, but the thinness of his hair 
and his lined face betrayed a consid- 
erable age -I estimated him to be at 
least two thousand five hundred 
miles old. My father, too, now I 
could see him in the company of his 
contemporaries, seemed remarkably 
old. He was of an age similar to 
Clausewitz and yet logic denied this. 
It would mean that my father would 
have been about eighteen hundred 
miles at the time I was born and I 
already knew that it was the custom 
in the city to produce children as 
soon after reaching maturity as 
possible. 

The other guildsmen were consid- 
erably younger. Some were evidently 
only a few miles older than myself— a 
fact that gave me some encourage- 
ment. Now that I had entered the 
adult world I wished to be finished 
with the apprenticeship at the 
earliest opportunity. The implication 
was that the apprenticeship had no 
fixed term and if, as Bruch had said, 
status in the city was a result of 
ability, then with application I could 
become a full guildsman within a 
relatively short period of time. 

There was one person missing 
whom I would have liked to see 
there. That was Jase. 

Speaking to one of the Traction 
guildsmen, I asked after him. 

“Gelman Jase?” he said. “I think 
he’s away from the city.” 

“Couldn’t he have come back for 



14 



GALAXY 




this?” I said. “We shared a cabin in 
the creche.” 

“Jase will be away for many miles 
to come.” 

“Where is he?” 

The guildsman only smiled at this, 
infuriating me— for surely, now I had 
taken the oath, I could be told? 

Later I noticed that no other 
apprentices were present. Were they 
all away from the city? If so, that 
probably meant that very soon I, 
too, could leave. 

After a few minutes of talking to 
the guildsmen Clausewitz called for 
attention. 

“I propose to recall the adminis- 
trators,” he said. “Are there any 
objections?” 

A sound of general approval came 
from the guildsmen. 

“In which case,” Clausewitz con- 
tinued, “I would remind the appren- 
tice that this is the first occasion of 
many on which he is bound by his 
oath.” 

C LAUSEWITZ moved down from 
the platform and two or three 
of the guildsmen opened the doors of 
the hall. Slowly the other people 
returned to the ceremony. Now the 
atmosphere lightened considerably. 
As the hall filled up I heard laughter 
and in the background I noticed that 
a long table was being set up. There 
seemed to be no rancor from the 
administrators about their exclusion 
from the ceremony that had just 
taken place. I assumed that the event 
was common enough to be taken as a 



matter of course, but it crossed my 
mind to wonder how much they 
were able to surmise. When secrecy 
takes place in the open, as it were, it 
lays itself open to speculation. Surely 
no security could be so tight that 
merely dismissing them from a room 
while an oath-taking ceremony took 
place would keep people in the dark 
as to what was happening? As far as I 
could tell, there had been no guards 
at the door— what would have pre- 
vented someone from eavesdropping 
while I spoke the oath? 

I had little time to consider this, 
for the room was filled with activity. 
People spoke together in an animated 
way and there was much noise as the 
long table was laid with large plates 
of food and many different kinds of 
drink. I was led from one group of 
people to another by my father and 
was introduced to so many people 
that I was soon unable to remember 
names or titles. 

“Shouldn’t you introduce me to 
Victoria’s parents?” I asked, seeing 
Bridge-builder Lerouex standing to 
one side with a woman administrator 
whom I assumed to be his wife. 

“No— that comes later.” He led me 
on and soon I was shaking hands 
with yet another group of people. 

1 was wondering where Victoria 
was, for surely now that the guild 
ceremony was out of the way our 
engagement should be announced. 
By now I was looking forward to 
seeing her, partly from curiosity, but 
also because she was someone I 
already knew. I felt outnumbered by 



INVERTED WORLD 



15 




people both older and more experi- 
enced than I and Victoria was a 
contemporary. She, too, was of the 
creche; she had known the same 
people as I and was of a similar age. 
In this room full of guildsmen she 
would have been a welcome reminder 
of what was now behind me. I had 
taken the major step into adulthood 
and that was enough for one day. 

Time passed. I had not eaten since 
Bruch had woken me and the sight of 
the food reminded me of how 
hungry I was. My attention was 
drifting away from the more social 
aspects of the ceremony— it was all 
too much at once. For another half- 
hour I followed my father around, 
talking without much interest to the 
people to whom I was introduced, 
but what I would really have wel- 
comed at that moment was some 
time to myself so that I could eat— 
and think over all that I had learned. 

Eventually my father left me talk- 
ing to a group of people from the 
synthetics administration (the group 
which, I learned, was responsible for 
the production of all the various 
synthetic foods and organic materials 
used in the city) and moved over to 
where Lerouex was standing. I saw 
them speak together briefly and Le- 
rouex nodded. 

In a moment my father returned 
and took me to one side. 

“Wait here, Helward,” he said. 
“I’m going to announce your engage- 
ment. When Victoria comes into the 
room, come over to me.” 

He hurried away and spoke to 



Clause witz. The Navigator returned 
to his seat on the platform. 

“Guildsmen and administrators!” 
Clausewitz called over the noise of 
the conversations. “We have a further 
celebration to announce. The new 
apprentice is to be engaged to the 
daughter of Bridge-builder Lerouex. 
Future Surveyor Mann, would you 
care to speak?” 

My father walked to the front of 
the hall and stood before the plat- 
form. Speaking too quickly, he made 
a short speech about me. On top of 
everything else that had happened 
that morning this came as a new 
embarrassment. Uneasy together, my 
father and I had never been as close 
as he made out by his words. I 
wanted to stop him, wanted to leave 
the room until he had finished, but it 
was clear I was still the center of 
interest. I wondered if the guildsmen 
had any idea of how they were 
alienating me from their sense of 
ceremony and occasion. 

My father finished, but stayed in 
front of the platform. From another 
part of the hall Lerouex said that he 
wished to present his daughter. A 
door opened and Victoria came in, 
led by her mother. 

As my father had instructed I 
walked over and joined him. He 
shook me by the hand. Lerouex 
kissed Victoria. My father kissed her 
and presented her with a finger ring. 
Another speech was made. Eventu- 
ally, I was introduced to her. We had 
no chance to speak together. 

The festivities continued.

I WAS given a key to the creche, 
told that I might continue to use 
my cabin until accommodation could 
be found in guild quarters and re- 
minded once more of my oath. I 
went straight to sleep. 

I was awakened early by one of 
the guildsmen I had met the previous 
day. His name was Future Denton. 
He waited while I dressed myself in 
my new apprentice’s uniform and 
then led me out of the creche. We 
did not take the same route as that 
along which Bruch had led me the 
day before, but climbed a series of 
stairs. The city was quiet. Passing a 
clock I saw that the time was still 
very early indeed, just after three- 
thirty in the morning. The corridors 
were empty of people and most of 
the ceiling lights were dimmed. 

We came eventually to a spiral 
staircase, at the top of which was a 
heavy steel door. Future Denton 
took a flashlight from his pocket and 
switched it on. There were two locks 
to the door and as he opened it he 
indicated that I should step through 
before him. 

I emerged into cold and darkness, 
such extremes of both that they 
came as a physical shock. Denton 
closed the door behind him and 
locked it again. As he shone his 
flashlight around I saw that we were 
standing on a small platform, en- 
closed by a handrail about three feet 
high. We walked over and stood at 
the rail. Denton switched off his light

and the darkness was complete. 

“Where are we?” I asked. 

“Don’t talk. Wait— and keep 
watching.” 

1 could see absolutely nothing. My 
eyes, still adjusted to the compara- 
tive brightness of the corridors, 
tricked my senses into detecting 
colored shapes moving about me, but 
in a moment these stilled. The dark- 
ness was not the major preoccupa- 
tion— already the movement of the 
cold air across my body had chilled 
me and I was trembling. I could feel 
the steel of the rail in my grip like a 
spear of ice and moved my hands, 
trying to minimize the discomfort. It 
was not possible to let go, though. In 
that absolute dark the rail was my 
only hold on the familiar. I had never 
before been so isolated from what I 
knew, never before been confronted 
with such an impact of things un- 
known. My whole body was tense, as 
if bracing itself against some sudden 
detonation or physical shock, but 
none came. All about me was cold 
and dark and overwhelmingly silent, 
barring the sound of the wind in my 
ears. 

As the minutes passed— and my 
eyes became better able to adjust— I 
discovered I could make out vague 
shapes about me. I could see Future 
Denton beside me, a tall black figure 
in his cloak, outlined against the 
lesser darkness of what was above 
him. Beneath the platform on which 
we stood I could detect a huge, 
irregularly shaped structure, black 
and black on black. 



Around all this was impenetrable 
darkness. I had no point of reference, 
nothing against which I could make 
distinctions of form or outline. It 
was frightening, but in a way that 
struck emotionally, not in such a 
way that I felt at all threatened 
physically. Sometimes I had dreamed 
of such a place and then had awaken- 
ed, still experiencing the after-images 
of an impression such as this. This 
was no dream— the bitter cold could 
not be imagined, nor could the star- 
tling clarity of the new sensations of 
space and dimension. I knew only 
that this was my first venture outside 
the city— for this was all it could 
be— and that it was nothing like I had 
ever anticipated. 

When I fully appreciated that fact 
the effect of the cold and dark on 
my orientation became of subsidiary 
importance. I was outside. This was 
what I had been waiting for! 

There was no further need for 
Denton’s admonition to silence. I 
could say nothing and had I tried the 
words would have died in my throat 
or been lost on the wind. It was all I 
could do to look— and in looking I 
saw nothing but a deep, mysterious 
endlessness shrouded by the clouded 
night. 



A NEW sensation affected me: I 
. could smell the soil! It was 
unlike anything I had ever smelled in 
the city and my mind conjured a 
spurious image of many square miles 



18 



GALAXY 




of rich brown soil, moist in the night, 
I had no way of telling what it was I 
was actually smelling— it Was probably 
not soil at all— but this image of rich, 
fertile ground had been one that 
endured for me from one of the 
books I had read in the creche. It was 
enough to imagine it and once more 
my spirits rose as I sensed the 
cleansing effect of the wild, unex- 
plored land beyond the city. There 
was so much to see and do— and even 
yet, standing on the platform, every- 
thing remained for these few pre- 
cious moments the exclusive domain 
of the imagination. I needed to see 
nothing— the simple impact of this 
fundamental step beyond the city’s 
confines was enough to spark my 
underdeveloped imagination into 
realms which until that moment had 
been fed only by the writings of the 
authors I had read. 

Slowly the blackness became less 
dense, until the sky above me was a 
dark gray. In the far distance I could 
see where the clouds met the horizon 
and even as I watched I saw a line of 
the faintest red begin to etch the 
shape of one small cloud. As if the 
impact of the light were propelling it 
this cloud and all the others were 
moving slowly above us, borne on 
the wind away from the direction of 
the glow. The redness spread, touch- 
ing the clouds for a few moments as 
they moved away, leaving behind a 
large area of clear sky, which was 
itself colored a deep orange. My 
whole attention was riveted on this 
sight, for it was quite simply the 



most beautiful thing I had experi- 
enced in my whole life. Almost 
imperceptibly the orange was spread- 
ing and lightening— still the clouds 
were singed with red, but at the very 
point at which the horizon met the 
sky there was an intensity of light 
that grew brighter by the minute. 

The orange was dying. Far more 
quickly than I would have ever 
guessed, it thinned away as the 
source of light brightened. The sky 
now was a blue so pale and brilliant 
that it was almost white. In the 
center of it, as if growing up from 
the horizon, was a spear of white 
light, leaning slightly to one side like 
a toppling church steeple. As it grew 
it thickened and brightened, be- 
coming as the seconds passed so 
brilliant and incandescent that it was 
not possible to stare directly at it. 

Future Denton suddenly gripped 
my arm. 

“Look!” he said, pointing to the 
left of the center of brilliance. 

A formation of birds, spread out 
in a delicate vee, was flapping slowly 
from left to right across our vision. 
After a few moments, the birds 
crossed directly in front of the grow- 
ing column of light, and for a few 
seconds they could not be seen. 

“What are they?” I said, my voice 
sounding coarse and harsh. 

“Just geese.” 

They were visible again now, fly- 
ing slowly on, blue sky behind them. 
After a minute or so they became 
lost to sight beyond rising ground 
some distance away. 



INVERTED WORLD

I looked again at the rising sun. In 
the short time I had been looking at 
the birds it had been transformed. 
Now the bulk of its body had 
appeared above the horizon and it 
hung in sight, a long, saucer-shape of 
light, spiked above and below with 
two perpendicular spires of incandes- 
cence. I could feel the touch of its 
warmth on my face. The wind was 
dropping. 

I stood with Denton on that small 
platform, looking out across the 
land. I saw the city, or what part of 
it was visible from the platform, and 
I saw the last of the clouds disappear- 
ing across the horizon farthest from 
the sun. It shone down on us from a 
cloudless sky and Denton removed 
his cloak. 

He nodded to me and showed me 
how we could climb down from the 
platform, by way of a series of metal 
ladders, to the land below. He went 
first. As I stepped down and stood 
for the first time on natural ground I 
heard the birds that had nested in the 
upper crannies of the city begin their 
morning song. 

Ill 



F UTURE DENTON walked with 
me once around the periphery of 
the city, then took me out across the 
ground towards a small cluster of 
temporary buildings which had been 
erected about five hundred yards 
from the city. Here he introduced me 



to Track Malchuskin, then returned 
to the city. 

The Track was a short, hairy man, 
still half asleep. He didn’t seem to 
resent the intrusion and treated me 
with some politeness. 

“Apprentice Future, are you?” 

I nodded. “I’ve just come from the 
city.” 

“First time out?” 

“Yes.” 

“Had any breakfast?” 

“No. The Future got me out of 
bed and brought me more or less 
straight here.” 

“Come inside. I’ll make some 
coffee.” 

The interior of the hut was rough 
and untidy, in contrast to what I had 
seen within the city. There cleanli- 
ness and tidiness seemed to be of 
great importance, but Malchuskin ’s 
hut was littered with dirty pieces of 
clothing, unwashed pots and pans 
and half-eaten meals. In one corner 
was a large pile of metal tools and 
instruments and against one wall was 
a bunk, the covers thrown back in a 
heap! There was a background smell 
of old food. 

Malchuskin filled a pan with 
water, and placed it on a cooking 
ring. He found two mugs somewhere, 
rinsed them in the butt and shook 
them to remove the surplus water. 
He put a measure of synthetic coffee 
into a jug and when the water boiled 
filled it up. 

There was only one chair in the 
hut. Malchuskin removed some heavy 
steel tools from the table and moved 



20 



GALAXY 




it over to the bunk. He sat down and 
indicated that I should pull up the 
chair. We sat in silence for a while, 
sipping the coffee. It was made in 
exactly the same way as it was in the 
city, yet it seemed to taste different. 

“Haven’t had too many appren- 
tices lately.” 

“Why’s that?” I asked. 

“Can’t say. Not many of them 
coming up. Who are you?” 

“Helward Mann. My father is—” 
“Yeah, I know. Good man. We 
were in the creche together.” 

I frowned at that. Surely he and 
my father were not of the same age? 
Malchuskin saw my expression. 

“Don’t let it bother you,” he said. 
“You’ll understand one day. You’ll 
find out the hard way, just like 
everything else in this goddam guild 
system makes you learn. It’s a 
strange life in the Future guild. It 
wasn’t for me, but I guess you’ll 
make out.” 

“Why didn’t you want to be a 
Future?” 

“I didn’t say I didn’t want it— I 
meant it wasn’t my lot. My own 
father was a Tracksman. The guild 
system again. But you want it hard, 
they’ve put you in the right hands. 
Done much manual work?” 

“No-” 

He laughed loudly. “The appren- 
tices never have. You’ll get used to 
it.” He stood up. “It’s time we 
started. It’s early, but now you’ve 
got me out of bed there’s no point 
being idle. They’re a lazy lot of 
bastards.” 



He left the hut. I finished the rest 
of my coffee in a hurry, scalding my 
tongue, and went after him. He was 
walking toward the other two build- 
ings. I caught up with him. 

With a metal wrench he had 
taken from the hut he banged loudly 
on the door of each of the other two 
buildings, bawling at whoever was 
inside to get up. I saw from the 
marks on the doors that he probably 
always hit them with a piece of 
metal. 

We heard movement inside. 

Malchuskin went back to his hut 
and began sorting through some of 
the tools. 

“Don’t have too much to do with 
these men,” he warned me. “They’re 
not from the city. There’s one of 
them— I’ve put him in charge. Rafael. 
He speaks a little English and acts as 
interpreter. If you want anything 
speak to him. Better still, come to 
me. There’s not likely to be trouble, 
but if there is— call me. Okay?” 

“What kind of trouble?” 

“They don’t do what you or I tell 
them. They’re being paid and they 
get paid to do what we want. It’s 
trouble if they don’t. But the only 
thing wrong with this lot is that 
they’re too lazy for their own good. 
That’s why we start early. It get^hot 
later on and then we might as well 
not bother.” 

The day was already warm. The 
sun had risen high while I had been 
with Malchuskin and my eyes were 
beginning to water. They weren’t 
accustomed to such bright light. I 



INVERTED WORLD 



21 




had tried to glance at the sun again, 
but it was impossible to look directly 
at it. 

“Take these.” Malchuskin passed 
me a large armful of steel wrenches 
and I staggered under the weight, 
dropping two or three. He watched 
in silence as I picked them up, 
ashamed at my ineptitude. 

“Where to?” 

“The city, of course. Don’t they 
teach you anything there?” 

I headed away from the hut, to- 
ward the city. Malchuskin watched 
from the door of his hut. 

“South side—” he shouted after 
me. I stopped and looked round 
helplessly. Malchuskin came over to 
me. 

“There.” He pointed. “The tracks 
at the south of the city. Okay?” 

“Okay.” I walked in that direc- 
tion, dropping only one more wrench 
on the way. 

AFTER an hour or two I began to 
xm see what Malchuskin had meant 
about the men who worked with us. 
They stopped at the slightest excuse 
and only Malchuskin ’s bawling or 
Rafael’s sullen instructions kept 
them at it. 

“Who are they?” I asked Mal- 
chuskin when we stopped for a fif- 
teen-minute break. 

“Local men.” 

“Couldn’t we hire better ones?” 

“They’re all the same around 
here.” 

I sympathized with them to a 



certain degree. Out in the open, with 
no shade at all, the work was vigo- 
rous and hot. Although I was deter- 
mined not to slacken, the physical 
strain was more than I could bear. 
Certainly it was more strenuous than 
anything I had ever experienced. 

The tracks at the south of the 
city ran for about half a mile, ending 
in no particular place. There were 
four tracks, each consisting of two 
metal rails supported on timber 
sleepers, which were in turn resting 
on sunken concrete foundations. 
Two of the tracks had already been 
considerably shortened by Mal- 
chuskin and his crew and we were 
working on the longest one still 
extant, the one laid as right outer. 

Malchuskin explained that if I 
assumed the city was to the front of 
us, the four tracks were identified by 
left and right, outer and inner in each 
case. 

Little thought was involved. What 
had to be done was routine, but 
heavy work. 

In the first place the tie-bars con- 
necting the rail to the sleepers had to 
be released for the whole length of 
the section of rail. This was then laid 
to one side and the other rail simi- 
larly released. Next we tackled the 
sleepers. These were attached to the 
concrete foundations by two clamps, 
each of which had to be slackened 
and removed manually. When the 
sleeper came free it was stacked on a 
bogie waiting on the next section of 
track. The concrete foundation, 
which I discovered was prefabricated 



22 



GALAXY 




and reusable, then had to be dug out 
of its soil emplacement and similarly 
placed on the bogie. When all this 
was done the two steel rails were 
placed on special racks along the side 
of the bogie. 

Malchuskin or I would then drive 
the battery-powered bogie up to the 
next section of track and the process 
would be repeated. When the bogie 
was fully loaded the entire track 
crew would ride on it up to the rear 
of the city. Here it would be parked 
and the battery recharged from an 
electrical point fitted to the wall of 
the city for this purpose. 

It took us most of the morning to 
load the bogie and take it up to the 
city. My arms felt as if they had been 
stretched from their sockets. My 
back was aching. I was filthy dirty 
and covered with sweat. Malchuskin, 
who had done no less work than any 
of the others— probably more- 
grinned at me. 

“Now we unload and start again,” 
he said. 

I looked over at the laborers. They 
looked like I felt, although I sus- 
pected I, too, had done more than 
they, considering I was new to it and 
hadn’t yet learned the art of using 
my muscles economically. Most of 
them were lying back in what little 
shadow was afforded by the bulk of 
the city. 

“Okay,” I said. 

“No— I was joking. You think that 
lot would do any more without a 
bellyful of food?” 

“No.” 



“Right, then— we eat.” 

He spoke to Rafael, then walked 
toward his hut. I went with him and 
we shared some of the heated-up 
synthetic food that was all he could 
offer. 

T HE afternoon started with the 
unloading. The sleepers, founda- 
tions and rails were loaded on to 
another battery-powered vehicle— 
this one traveled on four large bal- 
loon tires. When the transfer was 
completed, we took the bogie down 
to the end of the track and began 
again. The afternoon was hot and the 
men worked slowly. Even Mal- 
chuskin had eased up and after the 
bogie had been refilled with its next 
load he called a halt. 

“Like to have got another load in 
today,” he said and took a long 
draught from a bottle of water. 

“I’m ready,” I said. 

“Maybe. You want to do it on 
your own?” 

“Look— I’m willing, ” I said, not 
wanting to reveal the exhaustion I 
was feeling. 

“As it is you’ll be useless to- 
morrow. No, we get this bogie un- 
loaded, run it down to the track-end 
and that’s it.” 

That wasn’t quite it, as things 
turned out. When we returned the 
bogie to the track-end, Malchuskin 
started the men filling in the last 
section of the track with as much 
loose soil and dirt as we could find. 
This rubble was laid for twenty 
yards.

I asked Malchuskin its purpose. 

He nodded toward the nearest 
long track, the left inner. At its end 
was a massive concrete buttress, 
stayed firmly into the ground. 

“You’d rather put up one of those 
instead?” he said. 

“What is it?” 

“A buffer. Suppose the cables all 
broke at once— the city would run 
backward off the rails. As it is, the 
buffers wouldn’t put up much resis- 
tance, but it’s all we can do.” 

“Has the city ever run back?” 
“Once.” 

M alchuskin offered me the 

choice of returning to my 
cabin in the city or remaining with 
him in his hut. The way he put it 
didn’t leave me much choice. He 
obviously had low regard for the 
people inside the city, told me he 
rarely went inside. 

“It’s a cozy existence,” he said. 
“Half the people in the city don’t 
know what’s going on out here. And 
I don’t suppose they’d care if they 
did know.” » 

“Why should they have to know? 
After all, if we can keep working 
smoothly it’s not their problem.” 

“I know, I know. But I wouldn’t 
have to use these damned local men 
if more city people came out here.” 
In the nearby dormitory huts the 
hired men were talking noisily. Some 
were singing. 

“Don’t you have anything at all to 
do with them?” 

“I just use them. They’re the 



Barter people’s pigeon. If they get 
too lousy I lay them off and get the 
Barters to find me some more. Never 
difficult. Work’s . in short supply 
around here.” 

“Where is this?” 

“Don’t ask me— that’s up to your 
father and his guild. I just dig up old 
tracks.” 

I sensed that Malchuskin was less 
alienated from the city than he made 
out. I supposed his relatively isolated 
existence gave him some contempt 
for those within the city, but as far 
as I could see he didn’t have to stay 
out here in the hut. Lazy the workers 
might be, and just now noisy, but 
they seemed to act in an orderly 
manner. Malchuskin made no at- 
tempt to supervise them when there 
was no work to be done, so he could 
have stayed in the city if he chose. 

“Your first day out, isn’t it?” he 
reminded himself. 

“That’s right.” 

“You want to watch the sunset?” 

“No-why?” 

“The apprentices usually do.” 

“Okay.” 

Almost as if it were to please him I 
went out of the hut and looked past 
the bulk of the city toward the 
sky. Malchuskin came up behind me. 
hind me. 

The sun was near the horizon and 
already I could feel the wind cold on 
my back. The clouds of the previous 
night had not returned and the sky 
was clear and blue. I watched the 
sun, able to look at it without 
hurting my eyes now that its rays 



24 



GALAXY 




were diffused by the thickness of the 
atmosphere. It had the shape of a 
broad orange disk, slightly tilted 
down toward us. Above and below, 
tall spires of light rose from the 
center of the disk. As we watched it 
sank slowly beneath the horizon, the 
upper point of light being the last to 
vanish. 

“You sleep in the city, you don’t 
get to see that,” Malchuskin said. 

“It’s very beautiful,” I said. 

“You see the sunrise this morn- 
ing?” 

“Yes.” 

Malchuskin nodded. “That’s what 
they do. Once a kid’s made it to a 
guild, they throw him in at the deep 
end. No explanation, right? Out in 
the dark, until up comes the sun.” 
“Why do they do that?” 

“Guild system. They believe it’s 
the quickest way to get an apprentice 
to understand that the sun isn’t the 
same as he’s been taught.” 

“Isn’t it?” I said. 

“What were you taught?” 

“That the sun is spherical.” 

“So they still teach that. Well, 
now you’ve seen that the sun isn’t. 
Make anything of it?” 

“No.” 

“Think about it. Let’s go and eat.” 
We returned to the hut and Mal- 
chuskin directed me to start heating 
up some food while he bolted an- 
other bunk frame on top of the 
vertical supports around his own. He 
found some bedding in a cupboard 
and dumped it on the bunk. 

“You sleep here,” he said, indi- 



cating the upper bunk. “You restless 
at night?” 

“I don’t think so.” 

“We’ll try it for one night. If you 
keep moving around we’ll change 
over. I don’t like being disturbed.” 

I thought there was little chance I 
would disturb him. I could have slept 
on the side of a cliff that night, I was 
so tired. We ate the tasteless food 
together and afterwards Malchuskin 
talked about his work on the tracks. 
I paid him scant attention and a few 
minutes later I laid on my bunk, 
pretending to listen to him. I fell 
asleep almost at once. 

IV 

I WAS awakened the next morning 
by Malchuskin moving about the 
hut, clattering the dishes from the 
previous evening’s meal. I made to 
get out of the bunk as soon as I was 
fully conscious, but at once I was 
paralyzed by a stab of pain in my 
back. I gasped. 

Malchuskin looked up at me, 
grinning. 

“Stiff?” 

I rolled onto my side and tried to 
draw my legs up. These too were stiff 
and painful, but with a considerable 
effort I managed to get myself into a 
sitting position. I sat still for a 
moment, hoping that the pain was 
cramp and that it would pass. 

“Always the same with you kids 
from the city,” Malchuskin said, but 
without malice. “You come out here 
keen I’ll grant you. A day’s work and 



INVERTED WORLD 



25 




you’re so stiff you become useless. 
Don’t you get any exercise in the 
city?” 

“Only in the gymnasium.” 

“Okay, get down here and have 
some breakfast. After that you’d 
better go back to the city. Have a hot 
bath and see if you can find someone 
to give you a massage. Then report 
back here.” 

I nodded gratefully and clambered 
down from the bunk. This was no 
easier and no less painful than any- 
thing else I’d attempted so far. I 
discovered that my arms, neck and 
shoulders were as stiff as the rest of 
me. 

I left the hut thirty minutes later, 
just as Malchuskin was bawling at the 
men to get started. I headed back 
toward the city, limping slowly. 

It was the first time I had been left 
to my own devices away from the 
city. When in the company of others 
one never sees as much as when 
alone. The city was five hundred 
yards from Malchuskin ’s hut, and 
that was an adequate distance to be 
able to get some impression of its 
overall size and appearance. Yet dur- 
ing, the whole of the previous day I 
had been able to afford it only the 
barest of glances. It was simply a 
large gray bulk dominating the land- 
scape. 

Now, hobbling alone across the 
ground toward it I could inspect it in 
more detail. 

From the limited experience I had 
had of the interior of the city, I had 
never given much thought to what it 



might look like from outside. I had 
always conceived of it as being large, 
but the reality was that the city was 
rather smaller than I had imagined. 
At its highest point, on the northern 
side, it was approximately two hun- 
dred feet high, but the rest of it was 
a jumble of rectangles and cubes, 
fitted into what seemed to be a 
patternless arrangement of varying 
elevations. It was a dull brown and 
gray color, made as far as I could tell 
from many different kinds of timber. 
There seemed to be very little use of 
concrete or metals and nothing was 
painted. This external appearance 
contrasted sharply with the in- 
terior— or at least, those few areas I 
had seen— which were clean and 
brightly decorated. As Malchuskin’s 
hut was directly to the west of the 
city, it was impossible for me to 
estimate the width as I walked to- 
ward it, though I estimated its length 
to be about fifteen hundred feet. I 
was surprised at how ugly it was and 
how old it appeared to be. There was 
much activity about, particularly to 
the north. 

As I neared the city it occurred to 
me that I had no idea how I could 
enter it. Yesterday Future Denton 
had taken me around the exterior of 
the city, but my mind had been so 
swamped with new impressions that I 
had absorbed few of the details 
pointed out to me. It had looked so 
different then. 

My only clear memory was that 
there was a door behind the platform 
from which we had observed the 



26 



GALAXY 




sunrise and I decided to head for 
that. Tills was not as easy as 1 had 
imagined. 

I went to the south of the city, 
stepping over the tracks I had been 
working on the previous day, and 
moved around to the east side, where 
I felt sure Denton and I had des- 
cended by way of a series of metal 
ladders. After a long search I found 
such an access and began to climb. I 
went wrong several times and only 
after a long period of clambering 
painfully along catwalks and climb- 
ing gingerly up ladders did I locate 
the platform. I found that the door 
was locked. 

I had no alternative but to ask. I 
climbed down to the ground, and 
walked once more to the south of 
the city where Malchuskin and the 
gang of men had started work again 
on dismantling the track. 

With an air of aggrieved patience 
Malchuskin left Rafael in charge and 
showed me what to do. He led me up 
the narrow space between the two 
inner tracks, directly beneath the lip 
of the city’s edge. Underneath the 
city it was dark and cool. 

We stopped by a metal staircase. 

“At the top of that there’s an 
elevator,” he said. “You know what 
that is?” 

“Yes.” 

“You’ve got a guild key?” 

I fumbled in a pocket and pro- 
duced an irregularly shaped piece of 
metal that Clausewitz had given me. 
It opened the lock on the creche 
door. “Is this it?” 



“Yes. There’s a lock on the ele- 
vator, Go to the fourth level, find an 
administrator and ask if you can use 
the bathroom.” 

Feeling stupid, I did as he di- 
rected. I heard Malchuskin laughing 
as he walked back toward the day- 
light. I found the elevator without 
difficulty, but the doors would not 
open when I turned the key. I 
Waited. A few moments later the 
doors opened abruptly and two 
guildsmen came out. They took no 
notice of me and went down the 
steps to the ground. 

Suddenly the doors began to close 
of their own accord and I hurried 
inside. Before I could find any way 
of controlling the elevator, it began 
to move upward. I saw a row of 
keyed buttons placed on the wall 
near the door, numbered from one to 
seven. I jabbed my key into number 
four, but ineptly, making poor con- 
tact. The elevator seemed to be mov- 
ing for a long time, but then it halted 
abruptly. The doors opened and I 
stepped forward. As 1 came out into 
the passageway, three more guilds- 
men stepped into the car. 

I caught a glimpse of a painted 
sign on the wall opposite the car- 
seventh level. I had come too far. 
Just as the doors were closing I 
hurried inside again. 

“Where are you going, appren- 
tice?” one of the guildsmen asked. 

“Fourth level.” 

“All right, relax.” 

He used his own key on number 
four, and this time when the car 



INVERTED WORLD 



27 




stopped it was on the right level. I 
mumbled my thanks to the guilds- 
man who had spoken to me and 
stepped out. 

In my various preoccupations I 
had been able to overlook the dis- 
comforts in my body for the last few 
minutes, but now I felt tired and ill 
once more. In this part of the city 
there seemed to be much activity- 
many people moving about the cor- 
ridors, conversations going on, doors 
opening and closing. It was different 
from outside the city, for there was a 
timeless quality to the still country- 
side and although people moved and 
worked out there the atmosphere 
was more leisurely. The labors of 
men like Malchuskin and his gang 
had an elemental purpose but here, 
in the heart of the upper levels which 
had for so long been forbidden to 
me, all was mysterious and compli- 
cated. 

I remembered Malchuskin’s in- 
structions and, choosing a door at 
random, I opened it and went in. 
There were two women inside— they 
were amused but helpful when I told 
them what I wanted. 

A few minutes later I lowered my 
aching body into a bathful of hot 
water and closed my eyes. 

I T HAD taken me so much time 
and effort to get my bath that I 
had wondered whether I would bene- 
fit by it at all— the fact was that 
when I had toweled myself dry and 
dressed again the stiffness was not 
nearly as bad. There were still traces 



but the fatigue had gone. 

My early return to the city had 
inevitably brought Victoria to mind. 
The glimpse I had had of her at the 
ceremony had heightened my curi- 
osity. The thought of returning im- 
mediately to dig old sleepers out of 
the ground paled somewhat— al- 
though I felt I shouldn’t stay away 
from Malchuskin for too long— and I 
decided to see if I could find her. 

I left the bathroom and hurried 
back to the elevator. It was not in 
use, but I had to summon it to the 
floor I was on. When it arrived I was 
able to study its controls in rather 
more detail. I decided to experiment. 

I traveled first to the seventh level, 
but from a brief excursion into its 
corridors I could see no immediately 
obvious difference from the level I 
had just left. The same was true for 
most of the other levels, though 
there was more apparent activity on 
the third, fourth and fifth. The first 
level was the dark tunnel actually 
beneath the city itself. 

I rode up and down a couple of 
times, discovering that there was a 
surprisingly long distance between 
the first and second levels. All other 
distances were very short. I left the 
elevator at the second level, feeling 
intuitively that this would be where I 
would find the creche and that if I 
turned out to be wrong I would go in 
search of it on foot. 

Opposite the elevator entrance on 
the second level a flight of steps 
descended to a transverse corridor. I 
had a vague recollection of this from 



28 



GALAXY 




when Bruch had taken me up to the 
ceremony and soon I came across the 
door leading into the creche. 

Once inside, I locked the door 
with the guild key. It was all so 
familiar. I realized that until the 
moment I shut the door my move- 
ments had been guarded and cau- 
tious, but now I felt at home. I 
hurried down the steps and walked 
along the short corridor of the area I 
knew so well. It looked different 
from the rest of the city and it 
smelled different. I saw the familiar 
scratches on the walls, where genera- 
tions of children before me had 
inscribed their names, saw the old 
brown paint, the worn coverings on 
the floors, the unlockable doors to 
the cabins. Out of long habit I 
headed straight for my cabin, and 
went in. Everything here was un- 
touched. The bed had been made up 
and the cabin was tidier than it had 
ever been when I was using it regu- 
larly, but my few possessions were 
still in place. So, too, were Jase’s, 
though there was no sign of him, 

I looked around once more, then 
returned to the corridor. 

I headed on down the corridor 
toward the various rooms where we 
had been given lessons. Muted noises 
came through the closed doors. I 
peered through the circular glass 
peepholes and saw the classes in 
progress. A few days earlier I had 
been in there. In one room I saw my 
erstwhile contemporaries— some of 
them, like me, no doubt headed for 
an apprenticeship with one of the 



first-order guilds, most of them des- 
tined for administrative jobs in the 
city. I was tempted to go in and take 
their questions in my stride, main- 
taining a mysterious silence. 

There was no segregation of the 
sexes in the creche and in each room 
I peered into I searched vainly for a 
sight of Victoria. When I had 
checked all the classrooms I went 
down to the general area: the dining- 
hall (here there was background 
noise of the midday meal being 
prepared), the gymnasium (empty) 
and the tiny open space, which gave 
access only of sight to the blue sky 
above. I went to the common-room, 
that one place in the whole extent of 
the creche that could be used for 
general recreation. Here there were 
several boys, some of whom I had 
been working with only a few days 
before. They were talking idly, but as 
soon as they noticed me I became 
the center of attention. It was the 
situation I had just now resisted. 

They wanted to know which guild 
I had joined, what I was doing, what 
I had seen. What happened when I 
came of age? What was outside the 
creche? 

Curiously, I wouldn’t have been 
able to answer many of their ques- 
tions, even if I had been able to 
break the oath. Although I had done 
many things in the space of a couple 
of days, I was still a stranger to all 
that I was seeing. 

I found myself resorting-as in- 
deed Jase had done— to concealing 
what little I knew behind a barrier of 



INVERTED WORLD 



29 




crypticism and humor. I clearly dis- 
appointed the boys and, although 
their interest did not diminish, the 
questions soon stopped. 

I left the creche as soon as I could, 
since Victoria was evidently no long- 
er there. 

Descending by way of the ele- 
vator, I returned to the dark area 
beneath the bulk of the city and 
walked out between the tracks to the 
sunlight. Malchuskin was exhorting 
his unwilling laborers to unload the 
bogie of its rails and sleepers and he 
hardly noticed that I had returned. 

V 

T HE days passed slowly and I 
made no more return visits to 
the city. 

I had learned the error of my ways 
by throwing myself too enthusiasti- 
cally into the physical side of the 
track work. I decided to follow 
Malchuskin’s lead and confined 
myself in the main to supervising the 
hired laborers. Only occasionally 
would he and I pitch in and help. 
Even so, the work was arduous and 
long and I felt my body responding 
to the new labors. I soon felt fitter 
than ever before in my life— my skin 
was reddening under the rays of the 
sun and soon the physical work 
became less of a strain. 

My only real complaint was with 
the unvarying diet of synthesized 
food and Malchuskin’s inability to 
talk interestingly about the contribu- 
tion we were making to the city’s 



security. We would work late into 
the evenings and after a rough meal 
we would sleep. 

Our work on the tracks to the 
south of the city was nearly com- 
plete. The task was to remove all the 
track and erect four buffers at a 
uniform distance from the city. The 
track we removed was carried around 
to the north of the city where it was 
being relaid. 

One evening Malchuskin asked me, 
“How long have you been out here?” 

“I’m not sure.” 

“In days.” 

“Oh— seven.” 

I had been trying to estimate it in 
terms of miles. 

“In three days’ time you get some 
leave. You have two days inside the 
city, then you come back here for 
another mile.” 

I asked him how he reckoned the 
passage of time in terms of both days 
and distance. 

“It takes the city about ten days 
to cover a mile,” he said. “And in a 
year it will cover about thirty -six and 
a half.” 

“But the city isn’t moving.” 

“Not at the moment. It will be 
soon. Anyway, we don’t take ac- 
count of how much the city has 
actually moved, so much as how 
much it should have moved. It’s 
based on the position of the opti- 
mum.” 

I shook my head. “What does that 
mean?” 

“The optimum is the ideal posi- 
tion for the city to be. To maintain 



30 



GALAXY 




that it would have to move approxi- 
mately a tenth of a mile every day. 
That’s obviously out of the question, 
so we move the city toward optimum 
whenever we can.” 

“Has the city ever reached opti- 
mum?” 

“Not as long as I can remember.” 
“Where’s the optimum now?” 
“About three miles ahead of us. 
That’s average. My father was out 
here on the tracks before me and he 
told me once that they were then 
about ten miles from optimum. 
That’s the most I’ve ever heard.” 

“But what would happen if we 
ever reached optimum?” 

Malchuskin grinned. “We’d go on 
digging up old tracks.” 

“Why?” 

“Because the optimum’s always 
moving. But we’re not likely to reach 
optimum and it doesn’t matter that 
much. Anywhere within a few miles 
of it is okay. Put it this way— if we 
could get ahead of optimum for a bit 
we could all have a good long rest.” 
“Is that possible?” 

“I guess so. Look at it this way. 
Where we are at the moment the 
ground is fairly high. To get up here 
we had to go through a long stretch 
of rising country. That was when my 
father was out here. It’s harder work 
to climb, so it took longer and we 
got behind optimum. If we ever 
come to some lower country we can 
coast down the slope.” 

“What are the prospects of that?” 
“You’d better ask your guild that. 
Not my concern.” 



“But what’s the countryside like 
here?” 

“I’ll show you tomorrow.” 

Though I hadn’t followed much of 
what Malchuskin said, at least one 
thing had become clear, and that was 
how time was measured. I was six 
hundred and fifty miles old? that did 
not mean that the city had moved 
that distance during my lifetime, but 
that the optimum had. 

Whatever the optimum was. 

T HE next day Malchuskin kept 
his promise. While the hired 
laborers took one of their customary 
rests in the deep shadow of the city 
Malchuskin walked with me to a low 
rise of land some distance to the east. 
Standing there we could see almost 
the whole of the city’s immediate 
environment. 

It was at present standing in the 
center of a broad valley, bounded 
north and south by two relatively 
high ridges of ground. To the south I 
could see clearly the traces of the 
track that had been taken up, 
marked by four parallel rows of scars 
where the sleepers and their founda- 
tions had been laid. 

To the north of the city the tracks 
ran smoothly up the slope of the 
ridge. There was not much activity 
here, though I could see one of the 
battery-driven bogies rolling slowly 
up the slope with its load of rail and 
sleepers and its attendant crew. On 
the crest of the ridge itself there was 
a considerable degree of activity, 



INVERTED WORLD 



31 




although from the distance it was not 
possible to determine exactly what 
was going on. 

“Good country this,” Malchuskin 
said, but then immediately qualified 
it. “For a trackman, that is.” 

“Why?” 

“It’s smooth. We can take ridges 
and valleys in our stride. What gets 
me bothered is broken ground: 
rocks, rivers or even forests. That’s 
one of the advantages of being high 
at the moment. This is all very old 
rock around here, and it’s been 
smoothed out by the elements. But 
don’t talk to me about rivers. Then I 
get agitated.” 

“What’s wrong with rivers?” 

“I said don’t talk about them!” He 
slapped me good-humoredly on the 
shoulders and we started our walk 
back toward the city. “Rivers have to 
be crossed. That means a bridge has 
to be built unless there’s one already 
there, which there never is. We have 
to wait around while the bridge is 
made ready and that causes a delay. 
Usually it’s the Track guild that gets 
the blame for delays. But that’s life. 
The trouble with rivers is that every- 
one’s got mixed feelings about them. 
The one thing the city’s permanently 
short of is water and if we come 
across a river that solves one problem 
for the time being. But we still have 
to build a bridge and that gets 
everyone nervous.” 

The hired laborers did not look 
exactly pleased to see us when we 
returned, but Rafael moved them 
and work soon recommenced. The 



last of the tracks had now been taken 
up, and all we had left to do was 
build the last buffer. This was a steel 
erection, mounted above and across 
the last section of track and utilizing 
three of the concrete sleeper founda- 
tions. Each of the four tracks had a 
buffer and these were placed in such 
a way that if the city were to roll 
backward it would be supported. The 
buffers were not in a line, owing to 
the irregular shape of the southern 
side of the city, and Malchuskin did 
not pretend they were an adequate 
safeguard. 

“I shouldn’t like them to have to 
be used,” he said, “but if the city did 
roll, they would slow it even if they 
failed to stop it.” 

With the completion of the buffer 
our work was finished. 

“What now?” I asked. 

Malchuskin glanced up at the sun. 
“We ought to move house. I’d like to 
get my hut up across the ridge and 
there are the dormitories for the 
workers. It’s getting late, though. I’m 
not sure that we could get it done 
before nightfall.” 

“We could do it tomorrow.” 
“That’s what I’m thinking. It’ll 
give the lazy bastards a few hours 
off. They’d like that.” 

He spoke to Rafael, who consulted 
the other men. There was little doubt 
about the decision. Almost before 
Rafael had finished speaking some of 
them started to walk off. 

“Where are they, going?” 

“Back to their village, I expect,” 
said Malchuskin. “It’s just over' 



32 



GALAXY 




there.” He pointed toward the south- 
east, over beyond the southern ridge 
of high ground. “They’ll be back, 
though. They don’t like the work but 
there’ll be pressure in the village, 
because we give them what they 
want.” 

“What’s that?” 

“The benefits of civilization,” he 
said, grinning cynically. “To wit, the 
synthetic food you’re always griping 
about.” 

“They like that stuff?” 

“No more than you do. But it’s 
better than an empty belly, which is 
what most of them had before we 
happened along here.” 

“I don’t think I’d do all that work 
for that gruel. It’s tasteless, it’s got 
no substance and—” 

“How many meals a day did you 
eat in the city?” 

“Three.” 

“And how many were synthetic?” 
“Only two,” I said. 

“Well, people like those poor sods 
work their skins off just so you can 
eat one genuine meal a day. And 
from what I hear, what they do for 
me is the least of it.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“You’ll find out.” 

Later that evening, as we sat in his 
hut, Malchuskin spoke more on this 
subject. I discovered that he wasn’t 
as ill-informed as he tried to make 
out. He blamed it all on the guild 
system, as ever. It had been a long- 
established practice that the ways of 
the city were passed down from one 
generation to the next, not by tui- 



tion but on heuristic principles. An 
apprentice would value the traditions 
of the guilds far more by understand- 
ing at first hand the facts of exis- 
tence on which they were based than 
by being trained in a theoretical 
manner. In practice, it meant that I 
would have to discover for myself 
how the men came to work on the 
tracks, what other tasks they per- 
formed and in fact all other matters 
concerning the continued existence 
of the city. 

“When I was an apprentice,” Mal- 
chuskin said, “I built bridges and I 
dug up tracks. I worked with the 
Traction guild and rode with men 
like your father. I know myself how 
the city continues to exist and 
through that I know the value of my 
own job. I dig up tracks and lay 
them, not because I enjoy the work 
but because I know why it has to be 
done. I’ve been out with the Barter 
guild and seen how they get the local 
people to work for us so I under- 
stand the pressures that are on the 
men who work under me now. It’s all 
cryptic and obscure— that’s the way 
you see it now. But you’ll find out 
that it all has to do with survival— 
and you’ll learn just how precarious 
that survival is.” 

“I don’t mind working with you,” 
I said. 

“I didn’t mean that. You’ve 
worked okay with me. All I’m saying 
is that all the things you’ve probably 
wondered about— the oath, for in- 
stance— have a purpose and, by God, 
it’s a sensible purpose!”

“So the men will be back in the 
morning.” 

“Probably. And they’ll complain, 
and they’ll slacken off as soon as you 
or I turn our backs— but even that’s 
in the nature of things. Sometimes, 
though, I wonder—” 

I waited for him to finish his 
sentence, but he said nothing more. 
It was an uncharacteristic sentiment, 
for Malchuskin did not seem in any 
way a pensive man. As we sat to- 
gether he fell into a long silence, 
broken only when 1 got up to go 
outside to use the latrine. Then he 
yawned and stretched and kidded me 
about my weak bladder. 

R AFAEL returned in the morning 
with most of the men who had 
been with us before. A few were 
missing, though the numbers had 
been brought up to strength by 
replacements. Malchuskin greeted 
them without apparent surprise and 
at once began supervising the demoli- 
tion of the three temporary build- 
ings. 

First all the contents were moved 
out and placed in a large pile to one 
side. Then the buildings themselves 
were dismantled— not as difficult a 
task as I’d imagined, as they had 
evidently been designed to be taken 
down and put up again easily. Each 
of the walls was joined to the next 
by a series of bolts. The floors broke 
down into a series of flat wooden 
slats and the roofs were similarly 
bolted into place. Fittings such as 
doors and windows were part of the 



frames in which they sat. It took 
only an hour to demolish each cabin 
and by midday everything was done. 
Well before then Malchuskin had 
gone off by himself, returning a 
half-hour later in a battery-powered 
truck. We took a short break and ate 
a meal, then loaded the truck with as 
much of the material as it would 
hold and set off toward the ridge, 
Malchuskin driving. Rafael and a few 
of the workers clung to the sides of 
the truck. 

It was some way to the ridge. 
Malchuskin steered a course that 
brought us diagonally toward the 
nearest part of the track and we 
drove the rest of the way alongside 
it. There was a shallow dip in the 
breast of the ridge and it was through 
this that the four pairs of rails had 
been laid. There were many men 
working this part of the track, some 
hacking manually at the ground to 
each side of the track— presumably to 
widen the dip sufficiently to take the 
bulk of the city as it passed through. 
Others toiled with mechanical drills, 
trying to erect five metal frames, 
each bearing a large wheel. Only one 
had been so far securely laid and it 
stood between the two inner tracks, 
a gaunt, geometric design with no 
apparent function. 

As we passed through the dip 
Malchuskin slowed the truck, looking 
with interest at how the work was 
proceeding. He waved to one of the 
guildsmen supervising the work, then 
accelerated again as we passed over 
the summit of the ridge. From here a 



34 



GALAXY 




shallow downhill slope ran to a broad 
plain. To east and west, and on the 
far side of the plain I could see hills 
that were much higher. 

To my surprise the tracks ended 
only a short distance beyond the 
ridge. The left outer track had been 
built for about a mile, but the other 
three were barely a hundred yards 
long. Two teams were already at 
work on these tracks, but it was 
immediately clear that progress was 
slow. 

Malchuskin stared around. On our 
side of the tracks that is, on the 
western side— stood a small cluster of 
huts, presumably the living quarters 
for the track teams already here. He 
headed the truck in that direction, 
but drove some way past before 
stopping. 

“This’ll do,” he said. “We want 
the buildings up by nightfall.” 

I asked “Why don’t we put them 
up by the others?” 

“It’s my policy not to. 1 have 
trouble enough with these men as it 
is. If they have too much contact 
with the others they drink more and 
work less. We can’t stop them from 
mixing when they’re not working, 
but there’s no point in clustering 
them together.” 

“But surely they have a right to do 
what they want.” 

“They’re being bought for their 
labor. That’s all.” 

He clambered down from the 
cabin of the truck and began to 
shout at Rafael to start the work on 
the huts. 



The truck was soon unloaded and, 
leaving me in charge of the rebuild- 
ing, Malchuskin drove the truck back 
over the ridge to collect the rest of 
the men and the materials. 

AS NIGHTFALL approached, the 
/V rebuilding was nearly com- 
pleted. My last task of the day was to 
return the truck to the city and 
connect it to one of the battery 
recharging points. I drove off, con- 
tent to be alone again for a while. 

As I drove over the ridge the work 
on the raised wheels had finished for 
the day and the site was abandoned 
but for two militiamen standing 
guard, their crossbows slung over 
their shoulders. They paid no atten- 
tion to me. Leaving them behind, I 
drove down the other side toward 
the city. I was surprised to see how 
few lights were showing and how, 
with the approach of night, the 
daytime activities ceased. 

Where Malchuskin had told me I 
would find recharging points I dis- 
covered that other vehicles were al- 
ready connected up and no other 
places were available. I guessed that 
mine was the last truck to be re- 
turned that evening and that I would 
have to look around for more points. 
In the end I found a spare point on 
the south side of the city. 

It was now dark and after I had 
attended to the truck I was faced 
with the long walk back alone. I was 
tempted not to return, but to stay 
the night inside the city. After all, it 
would take only a few minutes to get 



INVERTED WORLD 



35 




back to my cabin in the creche— but 
then I thought of Malchuskin and the 
reaction I would get from him in the 
morning. 

Reluctantly I walked around the 
perimeter of the city, found the 
tracks leading northward and fol- 
lowed them up to the ridge. Being 
alone on the plain at night was a 
rather disconcerting experience. It 
was already cold and a strong breeze 
was blowing from the east, chilling 
me through my thin uniform. Ahead 
of me I could see the dark bulk of 
the ridge, set against the dull radi- 
ance of the clouded sky. In the dip, 
the angular shapes of the wheel 
structures stood on the skyline and, 
pacing to and fro in their lonely vigil, 
were the two militiamen. As I walked 
up to them I was challenged. 

“Stop right there.” Both men had 
come to a halt and, though I could 
not see for sure, I had a feeling that 
the crossbows were pointing in my 
direction. “Identify yourself.” 
“Apprentice Helward Mann.” 
“What are you doing outside the 
city?” 

“I’m working with guildsman Mal- 
chuskin. On the tracks. I passed you 
just now in the truck.” 

“Oh, yes. Come forward.” 

I walked up to them. 

“I don’t know you,” one of them 
said. “Have you just started?” 
“Yes-about a mile ago.” 

“Which guild are you in?” 

“The Futures.” 

The one who had spoken laughed. 
“Rather you than me.” 



“Why?” 

“I like a long life.” 

“He’s young, though,” the other 
said. 

“What are you talking about?” I 
said. 

“Been up future yet?” 

“No.” 

“Been down past yet?” 

“No. I only started a few days 
ago.” 

A thought occurred to me. Al- 
though I could not see their faces in 
the dark I could tell by the sound of 
their voices that they w'ere not much 
older than I. Perhaps seven hundred 
miles, not much more. But if that 
were so, then surely I should know 
them, for they would have been in 
the creche with me? 

“What’s your name?” I asked one 
of them. 

“Conwell Sturner. Crossbowman 
Sturner to you.” 

“Were you in the creche?” 

“Yes. Don’t remember you, 
though. But then, you’re just a kid.” 
“I’ve just left the creche. You 
weren’t there.” 

They both laughed again and I felt 
my temper weakening. “We’ve been 
down past, son.” 

“What does that mean?” 

“It means we’re men.” 

“You ought to be in bed, son. It’s 
dangerous out here at night.” 

“There’s no one around,” I said. 
“Not now. But while the softies in 
the city get their sleep, we save ’em 
from the tooks.” 

“What are they?” 



36 



GALAXY 




“The tooks? The local thugs who 
jump out of shadows on young ap- 
prentices.” 

I moved past them. I wished I’d 
gone into the city and hadn’t come 
this way. Nevertheless my curiosity 
was aroused. 

“Really— what do you mean?” I 
said. 

“There’s tooks out there who 
don’t like the city. If we didn’t 
watch them, they’d damage the 
track. See these pulleys? They’d have 
them down if we weren’t here.” 

“But it was the— tooks who helped 
put them up.” 

“Those as work for us. But there’s 
a lot as doesn’t.” 

“Get to bed, son. Leave the tooks 
to us.” 

“Just the two of you?” 

“Aye, just us— and a dozen more 
all over the ridge. You hurry on 
down to bed, sou, and watch you 
don’t get a quarrel between the 
eyes.” 

I turned my back on them and 
walked away. I was seething with 
anger and had I stayed a moment 
longer I felt sure I would have gone 
for one or the other of them. I hated 
their manly patronizing of me and 
yet I knew I had needled them. Two 
young men armed with crossbows 
would be no defense against a deter- 
mined attack and they knew it, too. 
But it was important for their self- 
esteem to belittle me and attach false 
prestige to themselves. 

When I judged I was out of their 
earshot I broke into a run and almost 



at once stumbled over a sleeper. I 
moved away from the track and ran 
on. Malchuskin was waiting in the 
hut, and together we ate another 
meal of the synthetic food. 

VI 

AFTER two more days’ work with 
Malchuskin the time came for 
my period of leave. In those two 
days Malchuskin spurred the laborers 
on to more work than I had ever 
seen them do and we made good 
progress. Although laying track was 
harder work than digging it up, there 
was the subtle benefit of seeing the 
positive results. The extra work took 
the form of having to dig the founda- 
tion pits for the concrete blocks 
before actually laying the sleepers 
and rail. As there were now three 
track crews working to the north of 
the city and each of the tracks was 
approximately the same length, there 
was the additional stimulus of com- 
petition among the crews. I was 
surprised to see how the men re- 
sponded to this competition and as 
the work proceeded there was a 
certain amount of good-natured ban- 
ter among them as they toiled. 

“Two days,” Malchuskin said just 
before I left for the city. “Don’t take 
any longer. They’ll be winching soon 
and we need every man available.” 
“Am I to come back to you?” 

“It’s up to your guild— but yes. 
The next two miles will be with me. 
After that you transfer to another 



INVERTED WORLD 



37 




guild and do three miles with them.” 

“Who will it be?” I said. 

“I don’t know. Your guild will 
decide that.” 

As we finished work late on the 
last night l slept in the hut. I had 
another reason, too— I had no wish to 
walk back to the city after dark and 
pass through the gap guarded by the 
militiamen. During the days there 
was little or no sign of the militia, 
but after my first experience of them 
Malchuskin had told me that a guard 
was mounted every night and during 
the period immediately prior to a 
winching operation the track was the 
most heavily guarded area. 

The next morning I walked back 
along the track to the city. 



I T WAS not difficult to locate Vic- 
toria now that I was authorized 
to be in the city. Before, I had been 
hesitant in looking for her, for at the 
back of my mind there had been the 
thought that I should have been 
getting back to Malchuskin as soon as 
I could. Now I had two whole days 
of leave and was relieved of the sense 
of evading my duties. 

Even so, I still had no way of 
knowing how to find her and had to 
resort to the expedient of asking. 
After a few misroutings I was di- 
rected to a room on the fourth level. 
Here Victoria and several other 
young people were working under 
the supervision of one of the women 
administrators. As soon as Victoria 
saw me standing at the door, she 



spoke to the administrator, then 
came over to me. We walked out to 
the corridor. 

“Hello, Helward,” she said, shut- 
ting the door behind her. 

“Hello. Look-if you’re working I 
can see you later.” 

“It’s all right. You’re on leave, 
aren’t you?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then I’m on leave, too. Come 
on.” 

She led the way down the cor- 
ridor, turned into a side passage, then 
walked down a short flight of steps. 
At the bottom was another corridor, 
lined on both sides by doors. She 
opened one of them and we went in. 

The room beyond was much larger 
than any private room 1 had so far 
seen inside the city. The largest single 
piece of furniture was a bed placed 
against one of the walls, but the 
room was also well and comfortably 
furnished with a quite surprising 
amount of floor space. Against one 
wall were a washbasin and a small 
cooker. I saw a table and two chairs, 
a cupboard to keep clothes in and 
two easy chairs. Most unexpected of 
all, there was a window. 

I went to it immediately and 
looked out. There was an area of 
open space beyond, bounded on the 
opposite side by another wall with 
many windows. The space extended 
to left and right, but the window was 
small and I could not see what lay at 
the sides of the space. 

“Like it?” Victoria said. 

“It’s large. Is it all yours?” 



38 



GALAXY 




“In a sense. Ours, once we’re 
married.” 

“Oh, yes. Someone said I’d have 
quarters to myself.” 

‘This is probably what they 
meant,” said Victoria. “Where are 
you living at the moment?” 

“I’m still in the creche. But I 
haven’t stayed there since the cere- 
mony.” 

“Are you outside already?” 

I wasn’t sure what to say. Outside. 
What could I tell Victoria, bound as I 
was to the oath? 

“I know you go outside the city,” 
said Victoria. “It’s not such a 
secret.” 

“What else do you know?” 

“Several things. But look, I’ve 
hardly spoken to you! Can I make 
you some tea?” 

“Synthetic?” I immediately re- 
gretted the question— I did not wish 
to seem ungracious. 

“I’m afraid so. But I’m going to be 
working with the synthetics team 
soon, so I might be able to find some 
way of improving it. 

The atmosphere relaxed slowly. 
For the first hour or two we ad- 
dressed each other coolly and almost 
formally, politely curious about one 
another, but soon we were able to 
take more things for granted. Vic- 
toria and I were not such strangers, I 
realized. 

The subject of conversation turned 
to our life in the creche and this 
immediately brought a new doubt to 
the surface. Until I had actually left 



the city, I had had no clear idea of 
what I would find. The teaching in 
the creche had seemed to me— and to 
most of the others— dry, abstract and 
irrelevant. There were few printed 
books, and most of those were fic- 
tional works dealing with life on 
Earth planet, so the teachers had 
relied mainly on texts written by 
themselves. We knew, or thought we 
knew, much about everyday life on 
Earth planet, but we were told that 
this was not what we would find on 
this world. A child’s natural curiosity 
immediately demanded to know the 
alternative, but on this the teachers 
had kept their silence. So there- was 
always this frustrating gap in our 
knowledge between what, by read- 
ing, we learned of life on a world 
that was not this one and what, by 
surmise, we were left to imagine of 
the ways of the city. 

This situation led to much discon- 
tent, evidenced by a surplus of un- 
spent physical energy. But where, in 
the creche, was the outlet? Only the 
corridors and the gymnasium gave 
space enough to move, and then with 
severe limitations. The need was 
manifest in unrest: in the younger 
children emotional outbursts and dis- 
obedience, in older children fighting 
and passionate devotion to what few 
sports could be played in the tiny 
gymnasium— and in those in their last 
few miles before coming of age a 
premature carnal awareness. 

There were token efforts at con- 
trol by the creche administrators, but 
perhaps they understood these activi- 



INVERTED WORLD 



39 




ties for what they were. In any event, 
I had grown up in the creche and I 
no less than anyone else had taken 
part in these occasional outbursts. In 
the last twenty miles or so before 
coming of age I had indulged myself 
in sexual relationships with some of 
the girls-Victoria not among them- 
and it had not seemed to matter. 
Now she and I were to marry, and 
suddenly what had gone before did 
matter. 

P ERVERSELY, the more we 
talked the more I found that I 
was wishing we could lay this ghost 
from the past. I wondered if I should 
detail my various experiences, ex- 
plain myself. Victoria, however, 
seemed to be in control of the 
conversation, directing it along chan- 
nels of mutual acceptability. Perhaps 
she, too, had her ghosts. She told me 
something of life in the city and I 
was, of course, interested to hear 
this. 

She said that as a woman she was 
not automatically granted a respons- 
ible position and only her engage- 
ment to me had made her present 
work possible. Had she become en- 
gaged to a non-guildsman she would 
have been expected to produce chil- 
dren as often as possible, and spend 
her time on routine domestic chores 
in the kitchens, or making clothes or 
whatever other menial tasks came 
along. Instead, she was now able to 
have some control over her future 
and could probably rise to the posi- 
tion of a senior administrator. She 



was currently involved in a training 
procedure similar in structure to 
mine. The only difference was that 
there appeared to be less emphasis on 
experience and more on theoretical 
education. Consequently she had al- 
ready learned far more about the city 
and how it was run internally than I 
had. 

I didn’t feel free to speak of my 
work outside, so I listened to what 
she said with a great deal of interest. 

She said that she had been told 
that there were two great shortages 
in the city: one was water— which I 
knew from what Malchuskin had 
said— and the other was population. 

“But there are plenty of people in 
the city,” I said. 

“Yes— but the rate of live births 
has always been low and it’s getting 
worse. What makes this even more 
serious is that there is a predomi- 
nance in the live births of male 
babies. No one is really sure why.” 

“It’s the synthetic food,” I said 
sardonically. 

“It might be.” She had missed the 
point. “Until I left the creche, I had 
only vague notions of what the rest 
of the city might be like— but I had 
always assumed that everyone in it 
had been born here.” 

“Isn’t that so?” 

“No. A lot of women are brought 
into the city in an effort to boost the 
population. Or, more specifically, in 
the hope they’ll produce female 
babies.” 

I said, “My mother came from 
outside the city.”

GALAXY 




“Did she?” For the first time since 
we had met Victoria looked ill at 
ease. “I didn’t know that.” 

“It doesn’t matter,” I said. 

Abruptly Victoria fell silent. It 
really wasn’t of much concern to me 
and I regretted having mentioned it. 

“Tell me more about this,” I said. 

“No— there’s not much more. 
What about you? What’s your guild 
like?” 

Quite apart from the fact that the 
oath forbade me to speak about it, I 
felt no inclination to talk. In that 
abrupt silence from Victoria I had 
gained a distinct impression that 
there had been more to say, but that 
some discretion prevented her from 
doing so. For the whole of my 
life— or at least as much of it as I 
could remember— the absence of my 
mother had been treated as a matter 
of fact. My father, whenever we 
spoke of it, talked factually about it, 
and there seemed to be no stigma 
attached. Indeed, many of the boys 
in the creche had been in the same 
situation as I and, what is more, most 
of the girls. Until the subject had 
provoked this reaction in Victoria I’d 
never thought about it. 

“You’re something of an oddity,” 
I said, hoping to get her to return to 
the subject by approaching it from a 
different direction. “Your mother is 
still in the city.” 

“Yes,” she said. 

So that was to be the end of it. I 
decided to let it drop. In any event, I 
hadn’t especially wanted to discuss 
matters outside ourselves. I had come 



to the city to spend my time getting 
to know Victoria, not to talk about 
genealogy. 

But the feeling persisted. The con- 
versation had died. 

“What’s out there?” I said, indicat- 
ing the window. “Can we go there?” 

“If you like. I’ll show you.” 

I followed her out of the room 
and along the corridor to where a 
door led to the outside. There was 
not much to see— the open space was 
no more than an alley running be- 
tween the two parts of the residential 
block. At one end of it there was a 
raised section, reached by a wooden 
staircase. We walked first to the 
opposite end, where another door led 
back into the city. Returning, we 
climbed the steps and came out on a 
small platform, where several 
wooden seats were placed and where 
there was room to move with some 
freedom. On two sides the platform 
was bounded by higher walls, pre- 
sumably containing other parts of 
the city’s interior and the side by 
which access was gained looked 
down over the roofs of the residen- 
tial blocks and along the alleyway. 
But on the fourth side the view was 
uninterrupted and it was possible to 
see out into the surrounding country- 
side. This was a revelation to me— the 
terms of the oath had implied that 
no one but guildsmen should ever see 
outside the city. 

“What do you think?” Victoria 
asked, sitting down on one of the 
seats which looked out across the 
view. 



INVERTED WORLD

I sat next to her. “I like it.” 

“Have you been out there?” 

“Yes.” It was difficult— already I 
was finding myself in conflict with 
the terms of the oath. How could I 
talk to Victoria about my work 
without breaking my word? 

“We’re not allowed up here very 
often. It’s locked at night and only 
open a few hours of the day. Some- 
times it’s locked for several days on 
end.” 

“Do you know why?” 

“Do you?” she asked. 

“It’s probably— something to do 
with the work out there.” 

“Which you’re not going to talk 
about.” 

“No,” I said. 

“Why not?” 

“I can’t.” 

She glanced at me. “You’re very 
tanned. Do you work in the sun?” 
“Some of the time.” 

“This place is locked when the 
sun’s overhead. All I’ve ever seen of 
it is the rays touching the higher 
parts of the buildings.” 

“There’s nothing to see,” I said. 
“It’s very bright and you can’t stare 
at it.” 

“I’d like to find that out for 
myself.” 



I ASKED, “What are you doing at 
the moment? In your work, I 
mean?” 

“Nutrition.” 

“What’s that?” 

“It’s determining how to work out 



a balanced diet. We have to make 
sure that the synthetic food contains 
enough protein and that people get 
the right amount of vitamins.” She 
paused, her voice having reflected a 
general lack of interest in the subject. 
“Sunlight generates vitamins, you 
know.” 

“Does it?” 

“Vitamin D. It’s produced in the 
body by the action of sunlight on the 
skin. That’s worth knowing if you 
ever see the sun.” 

“But it can be synthesized,” I said. 

“Yes— and it is. Shall we go back 
to the room and have some more 
tea?” 

I said nothing to this. I don’t 
know what I had expected from 
Victoria, but I had not anticipated 
this. Illusions of some romantic 
ideal had tempted me during my 
days of working with Malchuskin, 
and from time to time these had 
been tempered by a feeling that 
perhaps she and I might have to 
adapt to each other. In any event, it 
had never occurred to me that there 
would be an undercurrent of 
resentment between us. I had seen us 
working together toward realizing 
the intimate relationship planned, for 
us by our parents and somehow 
shaping it in such a way that it would 
become a realistic and perhaps even 
loving relationship. What I had not 
foreseen was that Victoria had seen 
us both in larger terms: that I would 
be forever enjoying the advantages of 
a way of life forbidden to her. 

We stayed on the platform. Vic-

toria’s remark about returning to the 
room had been an irony and, I was 
sensitive enough to identify it. Any- 
how, I felt that for different reasons 
we would both prefer to stay on the 
platform -I because my work outside 
had given me a taste for fresh air, and 
Victoria because this platform was as 
near as she could come to leaving the 
city. Even so, the undulating coun- 
tryside to the east of the city served 
as a reminder of the newly dis- 
covered difference that separated us. 

“You could apply to transfer to a 
guild,” I said in a moment. “I’m 
sure—” 

“I’m the wrong sex,” she said 
abruptly. “It’s men only, or didn’t 
you realize that?” 

“No.” 

“It hasn’t taken me long to work 
out a few things,” she went on, 
speaking quickly and barely suppress- 
ing her bitterness. “I’d seen it all my 
life and never recognized it: my 
father always away from the city, my 
mother working in her job, organiz- 
ing all those things we took for 
granted, like food and heating and 
disposal of sewage. Now I have recog- 
nized it. Women are too valuable to 
risk outside. They’re needed here in 
the city because they breed and they 
can be made to breed again and 
again. If they’re not lucky enough to 
be born in the city, they can be 
bought from outside and sent away 
when they’ve served their purpose.” 
The sensitive subject again, but this 
time she didn’t falter. “I know that 
the work outside the city has to be 



done and whatever it is it’s done at 
risk— but I’ve been given no option. 
Just because I’m a woman I have no 
choice but to be kept inside this 
damned place and learn fascinating 
things about food production, and 
whenever l can I have to give birth.” 
I asked, “Do you not want to 
marry me?” 

“There’s no alternative.” 

“Thanks.” 

S HE stood up, walked angrily 
toward the steps. I followed her 
down and walked behind her as she 
returned to her room. I waited in the 
doorway, watching her as she stood 
with her back to me, looking out of 
the window at the narrow alleyway 
between the buildings. 

“Do you want me to go?” I said. 
“No— come in and close the door.” 
She didn’t move. 

“I’ll make some more tea,” I said. 
“All right.” She entered reluctantly. 
The water in the pan was still 
warm and it took only a minute or so 
to bring it back to boiling. 

“We don’t have to marry,” I said. 
“If it’s not you it’ll be someone 
else.” She turned and sat beside me, 
taking her cup of the synthetic brew. 
“I’ve nothing against you, Helward. 
You should know that. Whether we 
like it or not, my life and yours are 
dominated by the guild system. We 
can’t do anything about that.” 

“Why not? Systems can be 
changed.” 

“Not this one. It’s too firmly 
entrenched. The guilds have the city 



INVERTED WORLD 



43 




sewn up, for reasons I don’t suppose 
I’ll ever know. Only the guilds can 
change the system and they never 
will.” 

“You sound very sure.” 

“I am,” she said. “And for the 
good reason that the system that 
runs my,. life is itself dominated by 
what goes on outside the city. As I 
can never take part in that I can 
never do anything to determine my 
own life.” 

“But you could— through me.” 
“You won’t even talk about it.” 

“I can’t,” I said. 

“Why not?” 

“I can’t even tell you that.” 

“Guild secrecy,” 

“If you like,” I said. 

“And even as you’re sitting here 
now, you’re subscribing to it.” 

“I have to,” I said simply. “I was 
made to swear—” 

Then I remembered: the oath it- 
self was one of the terms of the oath. 
I had breached it and so easily and 
naturally that it had been done be- 
fore I’d thought. 

To my surprise, Victoria reacted 
not at all. 

“So the guild system is ratified,” 
she said. “It makes sense.” 

I finished my tea. “I think I’d 
better go.” 

“Are you angry with me?” she 
asked. 

“No. It’s just-” 

“Don’t go. I’m sorry I lost my 
temper with you— it’s not your fault. 
Something you said just now- 
through you I could determine my 



own life. What did you mean?” 

“I’m not sure. I think I meant that 
as the wife of a guildsman, which I’ll 
be one day, you’d have more of a 
chance of—” 

“Of what?” 

“Well— seeing through me what- 
ever sense there is in the system.” 
“And you’re sworn not to tell 
me.” 

“I— yes.” 

“So first-order guildsmen have it 
all worked out. The system demands 
secrecy.” 

She leaned back and closed her 
eyes. 

I was confused and angry with 
myself. I had been an apprentice for 
ten days and already I was techni- 
cally under sentence of death. It was 
too bizarre to take seriously, but my 
memory of the oath was that the 
threat had been a convincing one at 
the time. The confusion arose be- 
cause unwittingly Victoria had in- 
volved the tentative emotional com- 
mitment we had made to each other. 
I could see the conflict, but could do 
nothing about it. I knew from my 
own life inside the creche the subtle 
frustrations that arose through being 
allowed no access to the other parts 
of the city. If that were extended to 
a larger scale— if one were allowed a 
small part in the running of the city, 
but had been given a point beyond 
which no actions were possible— the 
frustration would continue. But 
surely this was no new problem in 
the city? Victoria and I were not the 
first to be married in this way. 



44 



GALAXY 




Before us there must have been 
others who had encountered the 
same rift. Had they simply taken the 
system as it appeared to them? 

Victoria didn’t move as I left the 
room and strode toward the creche. 

AWAY from her, away from the 
xm inescapable syndrome of re- 
action and counterreaction, I became 
more worried about my own situa- 
tion. If the oath were to be taken at 
all seriously I could be killed should 
word reach one of the guildsmen. 
Could breaching the oath be that 
dreadful a thing? 

Would Victoria tell anyone else 
what I had said? On thinking this my 
first impulse was to go back to see 
her and plead for her silence— but 
that would have made both the 
breach and her own resentment more 
serious. 

I wasted the rest of the day, lying 
on my bunk and fretting about the 
situation. Later I ate in one of the 
dining rooms of the city and was 
thankful not to see Victoria. 

I N THE middle of the night, Vic- 
toria came to my cabin. My first 
awareness was of the sound of the 
door closing and as I opened my eyes 
1 saw her as a tall shape standing 
beside the bed. 

“Wha-” 

“Ssh. It’s me.” 

“What do you want?” I reached 
out to find the light switch, but her 
hand came across and took my wrist. 
“Don’t turn on the light.” 



She sat down on the edge of the 
bed and I sat up. 

“I’m sorry, Hel ward . That’s all I’ve 
come to say.” 

“Okay.” 

She laughed. “You’re still asleep, 
aren’t you?” 

“Not sure. Might be.” 

She leaned forward and I felt her 
hands press lightly against my chest 
and then move up until they were 
behind my neck. She kissed me. 

“Don’t say anything,” she said. 
“I’m just very sorry.” 

We kissed again and her hands 
moved until her arms were tight 
around me. 

“You wear a nightshirt in bed.” 
“What else?” 

“Take it off.” 

She stood up suddenly and I heard 
her undoing the coat she was wear- 
ing. When she sat down again, much 
closer, she was naked. I fumbled with 
my nightshirt, getting it caught as it 
came over my head. Victoria pulled 
back the covers and squeezed in 
beside me. 

“You came down here like that?” 
I asked. 

“There’s no one about.” Her face 
was very close to mine. We kissed 
again and as I pulled away my head 
banged against the cabin wall. Vic- 
toria cuddled up close to me, press- 
ing her body against mine. Suddenly 
she laughed loudly. 

“Great guilds! Shut up!” 

“Why?” 

“Someone will hear.” 

“They’re all asleep.” 



INVERTED WORLD 



45 




“They won’t be if you keep laugh- 
ing.” 

“I said, don’t talk.” She kissed me 
again. 

In spite of the fact that my body 
was already responding eagerly to her 
I was stricken with alarm. We were 
making too much noise. The walls in 
the creche were thin and I knew 
from long experience that sounds 
transmitted readily. With her laugh- 
ter and our voices, the fact that of 
necessity we were squeezed in the 
bunk against the walls, I was certain 
we’d awaken the whole creche. I 
pushed her away and told her this. 

“It doesn’t matter,” she said. 

“It does.” 

I flung back the bedcovers and 
scrambled over her. I turned on the 
light. Victoria shielded her eyes 
against the glare and I tossed her coat 
to her. 

“Come on. We’ll go to your 
room.” 

“No.” 

“Yes.” I was pulling on my uni- 
form. 

“Don’t put that on,” she said. “It 
smells.” 

“Does it?” 

“Abominably.” 

She sat up and as she did so I 
stared at her, admiring the neatness 
of her naked body. She pulled the 
coat around her shoulders, then got 
out of the bed. 

“Okay,” she said. “But let’s be 
quick.” 

We left my cabin and let ourselves 
out of the creche. We hurried along 



the corridors. As Victoria had said, 
this late at night no one was about 
and the corridor lights were dimmed. 
In a few minutes we had reached her 
room. I closed the door and bolted 
it. Victoria sat down on the bed, 
holding her coat around her. 

I took off my uniform and 
climbed into the bed. 

“Come on, Victoria.” 

“I don’t feel like it now.” 

“Guilds! Why not?” 

“We should have stayed where we 
were,” she said. 

“Do you want to go back?” 

“Of course not.” 

“Get in with me,” I said. “Don’t 
sit there.” 

“Okay.” 

She undid her coat and dropped it 
on the floor, then climbed in beside 
me. We put our arms around each 
other and kissed for a moment, but I 
knew what she meant. The desire had 
left me as rapidly as it had come. 
After a while we just lay there in 
silence. The sensation of being in bed 
with her was pleasant, but although I 
was aware of the sensuality of it 
nothing happened. 

Eventually, I said, “Why did you 
come .to see me?” 

“I told you.” 

“Was that all— that you were 
sorry?” 

“I think so.” 

“I nearly came to see you,” I said. 
“I’ve done something I shouldn’t. 
I’m frightened,” 

“What was it?” 

“I told you— I told you I had been 



46 



GALAXY 




made to swear something. You were 
right, the guilds impose secrecy on 
their members. When I became an 
apprentice I had to take an oath and 
part of it was that I had to swear I 
would not reveal the existence of the 
oath. I broke it by telling you.” 

“Does it matter?” 

“The penalty is death.” 

“But why should they ever find 
out?” 

“If-” 

Victoria said, “If I say anything, 
you mean. Why should I?” 

“Pm not sure. But the way you 
were talking today— your resentment 
at not being allowed to lead your 
own life— I felt sure you would use it 
against me.” 

“Until just now it meant nothing 
to me. I wouldn’t use it. Anyway, 
why should a wife betray her hus- 
band?” 

“You still want to marry me?” 
“Yes.” 

“Even though it was arranged for 
us?” 

“It’s a good arrangement,” she 
said and held me tighter for a few 
moments. “Don’t you feel the 
same?” 

“Yes.” 

A FEW minutes later Victoria said, 
. “Will you tell me what goes on 
outside the city?” 

“I can’t.” 

“Because of the oath?” 

“Yes.” 

“But you’re already in breach of 
it. What could matter now?” 



“There’s nothing to tell anyway,” 
I said. “I’ve spent ten days doing a 
lot of physical work and I’m not sure 
why.” 

“What kind of physical work?” 

“Victoria— don’t question me 
about it.” 

“Well, tell me about the sun. Why 
is no one in the city allowed to see 
it?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Is there something wrong with 
it?” 

“I don’t think so—” 

Victoria was asking me questions I 
should have asked myself, but 
hadn’t. In the welter of new experi- 
ences, there had been hardly time to 
register the meaning of anything I’d 
seen, let alone query it. Confronted 
with these questions— quite aside 
from whether or not I should answer 
them— I found myself demanding 
answers. Was there indeed something 
wrong with the sun that could endan- 
ger the city? Should this be kept 
secret, if so? But I had seen the sun 
and . 

“There’s nothing wrong with it,” I 
said. “But it doesn’t look the same 
shape as I’d thought.” 

“It’s a sphere.” 

“No it’s not. Or at least it doesn’t 
look like one.” 

“Well?” 

“I shouldn’t tell you, I’m sure.” 

“You can’t leave it like that,” she 
said. 

“I don’t think it’s important.” 

“I do.” 

“Okay.” I had already said too 



INVERTED WORLD

much, but what could I do? “You 
can’t see it properly during the day, 
because it’s so bright. But at sunrise 
or sunset you can see it for a few 
minutes. I think it’s disk -shaped. But 
it’s more than that and I don’t know 
the words to describe it. In the 
center of the disk, top and bottom, 
there’s a kind of shaft.” 

“Part of the sun?” 

“Yes. A bit like a spinning top. 
But it’s difficult to see clearly be- 
cause it’s so bright even at those 
times. The other night I was outside 
and the sky was clear. There’s a 
moon and that’s the same shape. But 
I couldn’t see that clearly either, 
because it was in the wrong phase.” 
“Are you sure of this?” 

“It’s what I’ve seen.” 

“But it’s not what we were 
taught.” 

“I know,” I said. “But that’s how 
it is.” 

I said no more. Victoria asked 
more questions but 1 pushed them 
aside, pleading that I did not know 
the answers. She tried to draw me 
out further on the work I was doing, 
but somehow I managed to keep my 
silence. Instead I asked her questions 
about herself and soon we had 
moved away from what was for me a 
dangerous subject. It could not be 
buried forever, but I needed time to 
think. Some time later we made love 
and shortly afterward we fell asleep. 

I N THE morning Victoria made 
some breakfast, then left me sit- 
ting naked in her room while she 



took my uniform to be laundered. 
While she was away I washed and 
shaved, then lay on the bed until she 
returned. 

I put my uniform on again. It felt 
crisp and fresh, not at all like the 
rather stiff and odorous second skin 
it had become as a result of my 
labors outside. 

We spent the rest of the day 
together. Victoria took me around to 
show me the interior of the city. It 
was far more complex than I had 
ever realized. Most of what l had 
seen until then was the residential 
and administrative section, but there 
was more to it than this. At first I 
wondered how I should ever find my 
way around until Victoria pointed 
out that in several places plans of the 
layout had been attached to the 
walls. 

I noted that the plans had been 
altered many times and one in parti- 
cular caught my attention. We were 
in one of the lower levels, and beside 
a recently drawn revised plan was a 
much older one, preserved behind a 
sheet of transparent plastic. I looked 
at this with great interest, noting that 
its directions were printed in several 
languages. Of these I could recognize 
only the French and English. 

“What are these others?” I asked 
her. 

“That’s German and the others are 
Russian and Italian. And this—” she 
pointed to an ornate, ideographic 
script— “is Chinese.” 

I looked more closely at the plan, 
comparing it with the recent one 



48 



GALAXY 




VII 



next to it. The similarity could be 
seen, but it was clear that much 
alteration work had been carried out 
inside the city between the compiling 
of the two plans. 

“Why were there so many lan- 
guages?” 

“We’re descended from a group of 
mixed nationals. I believe English has 
been the standard language for many 
thousands of miles, but that’s not 
always been the case. My own family 
is descended from the French.” 

“Oh, yes,” I said. 

On this same level Victoria showed 
me the synthetics plant. It was here 
that the protein-substitutes and other 
organic surrogates were synthesized 
from timber and vegetable products. 
The smell was terribly strong and I 
noticed that all the people who 
worked here were wearing masks. 
Victoria and I passed quickly into 
the next area, where research was 
carried out to improve texture and 
flavor. It was here, Victoria told me, 
sire would soon be working. 

Later Victoria expressed more of 
her frustrations, her fears for the 
future. This time I was more pre- 
pared and was able' to reassure her. I 
told her to look at her own mother, 
who led a fulfilled and useful life. I 
promised her— under persuasion— that 
I would tell her more of my own life 
and said that I would do what I 
could, when I became a full guilds- 
man, to make the system more open, 
more liberal. My promise seemed to 
quiet her a little and together we 
passed a relaxed evening and night. 



"▼7 ICTORIA and I agreed that we 
▼should marry as soon as possible. 
She told me that during the next 
mile she would find out what formal- 
ities we had to undergo and that if it 
were possible we would marry during 
my next period of leave or during the 
one after. In the meantime I had to 
return to my duties outside. 

As soon as I came out from 
underneath the city it was obvious 
that much progress had been made. 
The immediate environment of the 
city had been cleared of most of the 
impedimenta of the work. No tempo- 
rary buildings were in sight and no 
battery-operated vehicles stood 
against the recharging points— all, 
presumably, were in use beyond the 
ridge. A more fundamental differ- 
ence was that leading out from the 
northern edge of the city were five 
cables, which lay on the ground 
beside the tracks and disappeared 
from view over the hump of the 
ridge. On guard beside the track 
were several militiamen. 

Suspecting that Malchuskin would 
be busy I walked quickly toward the 
ridge. When I reached the summit my 
suspicions were confirmed. In the 
distance, where the tracks ended, a 
flurry of activity concentrated 
around the right inner track. More 
crews were working on some metal 
structures beyond, but from this 
distance it was impossible to deter- 
mine their function. I hastened 
down. 



INVERTED WORLD 



49 




The walk took me longer than I. 
had anticipated, as the longest sec- 
tion of track was now more than a 
mile and a half in length. Already the 
sun was high and by the time I found 
Malchuskin and his crew I was hot 
and sweaty. 

Malchuskin barely acknowledged 
me and I took off the jacket of my 
uniform and joined in the work. 

The crews were laboring to get this 
section of track extended to a length 
equal to the others, but the compli- 
cation was that a patch of ground 
with a rock-hard subsoil had been 
encountered. Although this meant 
that the concrete foundations were 
not necessary, the pits for the 
sleepers could only be dug with the 
greatest difficulty. 

1 found a pickaxe on a nearby 
truck and started to work. Soon the 
more sophisticated problems I had 
encountered inside the city seemed 
very remote indeed. 

In the periods of rest I ‘gathered 
from Malchuskin that apart from this 
section of track all was nearly ready 
for the winching operation. The 
cables had been extended and the 
stays were dug. He took me out to 
the stay-emplacements and showed 
me how the steel girders were buried 
deep into the ground to provide a 
sufficiently strong anchor for the 
cables. Three of the stays were com- 
pleted and the cables were con- 
nected. One more stay was in the 
process oh completion, and the fifth 
was being erected now. 

There was a general air of anxiety 



among the guildsmen working on the 
site and I asked Malchuskin the cause 
of this. 

“They’re fretting about time,” he 
said. “It’s taken us twenty-three days 
since the last winching to lay the 
tracks this far. On present estimates 
we’ll be able to winch the city 
tomorrow if nothing goes wrong. 
That’s twenty -four days. Right? The 
most we can winch the city this time 
is just under two miles-but in the 
time we’ve taken to do that the 
optimum has moved forward two 
and a half miles. So even when we’ve 
done this we’ll still be half a mile 
farther behind optimum than we 
were at the last winching.” 

“Can we make that up?” 

“On the next winching, perhaps. I 
was talking to some of the Traction 
men last night. They reckon we can 
do a short winch next time— and then 
two long ones. They’re worried 
about those hills.” He waved vaguely 
in a northern direction. 

“Can’t we go around them?” I 
said, noting that a long way to the 
northeast the hills appeared to be 
slightly lower. 

“We could— but the shortest route 
toward optimum is due north. Any 
angular deflection away from that 
just adds distance to be covered.” 

I didn’t fully understand every- 
thing he told me, but the sense of 
urgency came across clearly. 

“There’s one good thing,” Mal- 
chuskin went on. “We’re dropping 
this crowd of tooks after this. Future 
has found a bigger settlement some-

GALAXY 




where up north and the people there 
are desperate for work. That’s how I 
like them. The hungrier they' are the 
harder they’ll work— for a time at 
least.” 

The work continued. That evening 
we didn’t finish until after sunset, 
Malchuskin and the other Track 
guildsmen driving laborers with big- 
ger and better curses. I had no time 
to react one way or another, for the 
guildsmen themselves— and I— worked 
no less hard. By the time we returned 
to the hut for the night I was 
exhausted. 

I N THE morning Malchuskin left 
the hut early, instructing me to 
bring Rafael and the laborers to the 
site as soon as possible. When I 
arrived he and three other Track 
guildsmen were in argument with the 
guildsmen preparing the cables. I set 
Rafael and the men to work on the 
track, but I was curious about the 
dispute. When Malchuskin eventually 
came over to us he said nothing 
about it but threw himself into the 
work, shouting angrily at Rafael. 

Some time later, when we took a 
short break, I asked him about the 
trouble. 

“The Traction men,” he said, 
“want to start winching now, before 
the track’s finished.” 

“Can they do that?” 

“Yes. They say it’ll take some 
time to get the city up to the ridge 
and we could finish off here while 
that’s going on. We won’t allow it.” 
“Why not? It sounds reasonable.” 



“Because it would mean working 
under the cables. There’s a lot of 
strain on the cables, particularly 
when the city’s being winched up a 
slope, like the one before the ridge. 
You’ve never seen a cable break, have 
you?” It was a rhetorical question. I 
hadn’t known before this that cables 
were even used. “You’d be cut in 
half before you heard the bang,” 
Malchuskin finished sourly. 

“So what was agreed?” 

“We’ve got an hour to finish. Then 
they start winching.” 

There were still three sections of 
rail to lay. We gave the men a few 
more minutes’ rest and then the 
work started again. As there were 
now four guildsmen and their teams 
concentrated in one area we moved 
quickly, but even so it took most of 
the hour to complete the track. 

With some satisfaction Malchuskin 
signaled to the Traction men that we 
were ready. We collected our tools 
and carried them to one side. 

“What now?” I asked Malchuskin. 
“We wait. I’m going back to the 
city for a rest. Tomorrow we start 
again.” 

“What shall I do?” 

“I’d watch if I were you. You’ll 
find it interesting. Anyway, we ought 
to pay off these men. I’ll send a 
Barter guildsman out to you later 
today. Keep them here until he 
arrives. I’ll be back in the morning.” 
“Okay,” I said. “Anything else?” 
“Not really. While the winching is 
taking place the Traction men are in 
charge out here, so if they tell you to 



INVERTED WORLD 



51 




jump, jump. They might need some- 
thing done to the tracks, so you’d 
better be alert. But I think the tracks 
are all right. They’ve already been 
checked.” 

He walked away from me, toward 
his hut. He looked very tired. The 
hired men also went to their huts and 
soon I was left to my own devices. 
Malchuskin’s remark about the dan- 
ger of a breaking cable had alarmed 
me, so I sat down on the ground at 
what I considered a safe distance 
from the site. 

There was not much activity in the 
region of the stay emplacements. All 
five of the cables had been hooked 
up, and now ran slackly from the 
stays across the ground parallel to 
the tracks. Two Traction guildsmen 
were by the emplacements, carrying 
out what 1 presumed was a final 
check on the connections. 

From the region of the ridge a 
group of men appeared and walked 
in two orderly files toward us. From 
this distance it was not possible to 
see who they were, but I noticed that 
one of their number left the file at 
approximately hundred-yard inter- 
vals and took up a position at the 
side of the track. As the men ap- 
proached I saw that they were 
militiamen, each equipped with a 
crossbow. By the time the group 
reached the stay emplacements only 
eight of them were left and these 
took up a defensive formation. After 
a few minutes one of the militiamen 
walked over to me. 

“Who are you?” 



“Apprentice Helward Mann.” 
“What are you doing?” 

“I’ve been told to watch the 
winching.” 

“All right. Keep your distance. 
How many tooks are there here?” 
“I’m not sure,” I said. “About 
sixty, I think.” 

“They been working on the 
track?” 

“Yes.” 

He grinned. “Too bloody tired to 
do any harm. That’s okay. Let me 
know if they cause any trouble.” 

He wandered away and joined the 
other militiamen. What kind of 
trouble the laborers would cause 
wasn’t clear to me, but the attitude 
of the militia toward them seemed to 
be curious. I could only presume that 
at some time in the past the tooks 
had caused some kind of damage to 
the tracks or the cables, but l 
couldn’t see any of the men with 
whom we’d been working presenting 
a threat to us. 

T HE militiamen on guard beside 
the tracks seemed to me to be 
dangerously near the cables, but they 
showed no sign of any awareness of 
this. They marched patiently to and 
fro, pacing their allotted sections of 
the track. 

I noticed that the two Traction 
men at the emplacements had taken 
up a position behind metal shields, 
just beyond the stays. One of them 
had a large red flag and was looking 
through binoculars toward the ridge. 
There, beside the five wheel pulleys, 



52 



GALAXY 




I could just make out another man. 
As all attention seemed to be on this 
man I watched him curiously. He had 
his back toward us, as far as I could 
make out at this distance. 

Suddenly he turned and swung his 
flag to attract the attention of the 
two men at the stays. He waved it in 
a wide semicircle below his waist, to 
and fro. Immediately the man at the 
stays with the flag came out from 
behind his shield and confirmed the 
signal by repeating the movement 
with his own flag. 

A few moments later 1 noticed 
that the cables were sliding slowly 
across the ground toward the city. 
On the ridge I could see the pulley 
wheels turning as the slack was taken 
up. One by one the cables stopped 
moving, although the major part of 
their length still lay flat on the 
ground— I presumed because of the 
weight of the cables themselves, for 
in the region of the stays and the 
pulleys the cables were well clear of 
the ground. 

“Give them the clear,” shouted 
one of the men at the stays and at 
once his colleague waved his flag over 
his head. The man on the ridge 
repeated the signal, then moved 
quickly to one side and was lost to 
view. 

I waited, curious to see what was 
next— although from all I could see 
nothing was happening. The militia- 
men paced to and fro— the cables 
stayed taut. I decided to walk over to 
the Traction men and find out what 
was going on. 



No sooner was I on my feet and 
walking in their direction than the 
man who had been signaling waved 
his arms at me frantically. 

“Keep clear!” he shouted. 

“What’s wrong?” 

“The cables are under maximum 
strain!” 

1 moved back. 

The minutes passed and there was 
no evident progress. Then I realized 
that the cables had been slowly 
tightening until they were clear of 
the ground for most of their length. 

I stared southward at the dip in 
the ridge: the city had come into 
sight. From where I was sitting I 
could just see the top corner of one 
of the forward towers bulking up 
over the soil and rocks of the ridge. 
More of the city came into view even 
as I watched. 

I moved in a broad arc, still 
maintaining a healthy distance from 
the cables, and stood behind the 
stays, looking along the tracks to- 
ward the city. With painful slowness 
it winched itself up the farther slope 
until it was only a few feet away 
from the five wheel pulleys which 
carried the cables over the crest of 
the ridge. Here it stopped and the 
Traction men began their signaling 
once more. 

There followed a long and com- 
plicated operation in which each of 
the cables was slackened off in turn, 
while the wheel pulley was dis- 
mantled. I watched the first pulley 
removed in this way, then grew 
bored. I realized I was hungry and, 



INVERTED WORLD

suspecting that I was unlikely to miss 
anything of interest, I went back to 
the hut and heated a meal for myself. 

There was no sign of Malchuskin, 
although nearly all his possessions 
were still in the hut. 

1 took my time over the meal, 
knowing that at least another two 
hours would elapse before the winch- 
ing could be resumed. 1 enjoyed the 
solitude and the change from the 
strenuous work of the past day. 

When I left the hut I remembered 
the militiaman’s warning about po- 
tential trouble from the laborers and 
walked over to their dormitory. Most 
of them were outside, sitting on the 
ground, watching the work on the 
pulleys. A few were talking, arguing 
loudly and gesticulating, but I de- 
cided the militia saw threats where 
none existed. I walked back toward 
the track. 



I GLANCED at the sun-it was not 
long to nightfall. I reasoned that 
the rest of the winching should not 
take long once the pulleys were out 
of the way, for it was clear that now 
the tracks led along a downhill grad- 
ient. 

In due course the final pulley was 
removed and all five cables were once 
again taut. There was a short wait 
until, at a signal from the Traction 
man at the stays, the slow progress of 
the city continued— down the slope 
toward us. Contrary to what I had 
imagined, the city did not run 
smoothly of its own accord on the 



advantageous gradient. By the evi- 
dence of what I saw the cables were 
still taut— the city was still having to 
pull itself. As it came closer I de- 
tected a slackening of tension in the 
manner of the two Traction men, but 
their vigilance didn’t alter. Through- 
out the operation they concentrated 
their whole attention on the oncom- 
ing city. 

Finally, when the huge construc- 
tion was no more than about ten 
yards from the end of the tracks, the 
signaler raised his red flag and held it 
over his head. A large window ran 
across the face of the forward tower 
and here one of the many men who 
stood in view raised a similar flag. 
Seconds later the city halted. 

There was a pause of about two 
minutes. Then a man came through a 
doorway in the tower and stood on a 
small platform overlooking us. 

“Okay— brakes secured,” he called 
down. “We’re slackening off now.” 

The two Traction men came out 
from behind their metal shelters and 
stretched their limbs exaggeratedly. 
Undoubtedly they had been under 
considerable mental strain for several 
hours. One of them walked straight 
over to the edge of the city and 
urinated against its side. He grinned 
back at the other, then hauled him- 
self up onto a ledge and clambered 
up the superstructure of the city 
itself until he reached the platform. 
The other man walked down past the 
cables— which were now visibly slack- 
er-and disappeared under the lip of 
the city itself. The militiamen were 



54 



GALAXY 




still deployed in their defensive for- 
mation, but even they seemed to be 
more relaxed now. 

The show was over. Seeing the city 
so near I was tempted to go inside 
myself, but I wasn’t sure whether I 
should. There was only Victoria to 
see, and she would be occupied with 
her work. Besides, Malchuskin had 
told me to stay with the men and I 
thought I ought not disobey him. 

As I was walking toward the hut a 
man came to me from the direction 
of the city. 

“Are you Apprentice Mann?” 
“Yes.” 

“Jaime Codings, from the Barter 
guild. Track Malchuskin said there 
were some hired men here who were 
to be paid off.” 

“That’s right.” 

“How many?” said Codings. 

“In our crew, fifteen. But there 
are several more.” 

“Any complaints?” 

“What do you mean?” I said. 
“Complaints— any trouble, refusal 
to work.” 

“They were a bit slow, and Mal- 
chuskin was always shouting at 
them.” 

“Did they ever refuse to work?” 
“No.” 

“A11 right. Do you know who their 
squad leader was?” 

“There was one called Rafael, who 
spoke English.” 

“He’ll do.” 

T OGETHER we walked over to 
the huts and we found the men. 



At their sight of Codings, silence fed 
abruptly. 

I pointed out Rafael. Codings and 
he spoke together in Rafael’s lan- 
guage and almost at once one of the 
others shouted out angrily. Rafael 
ignored him and spoke to Codings, 
but it was clear that there was a lot 
of animosity. Once again someone 
shouted and soon many of the others 
had joined in. A crowd gathered 
around Codings and Rafael, some of 
the men reaching through the packed 
bodies and jabbing at Codings. 

“Do you need any help?” I 
shouted over the row at him, but he 
didn’t hear. I moved closer and 
shouted the question again. 

“Get four of the militia,” he called 
out in English. “Ted them to keep it 
low.” 

I stared at the arguing men for a 
moment, then hurried away. There 
was still a small group of the militia 
in the area of the cable stays and I 
went in that direction. They had 
evidently heard the noise of the 
argument and were already looking 
toward the crowd of men. When they 
saw me running over to them six of 
the men started out. 

“He wants four militiamen,” I 
said, gasping from my running. 

“Not enough. Leave that to me, 
sonny.” 

The man who had spoken, who 
was evidently in charge, whistled 
loudly and beckoned toward some 
more of his men. Four more militia- 
men left their position near the city 
and ran over. The group of ten 



INVERTED WORLD 



55 




soldiers now ran toward the scene of 
the argument. I tailed them. 

Without waiting to consult Col- 
lings, who was still in the center of 
the melee, the militiamen charged 
into the group of men, swinging their 
crossbows as clubs. Codings turned 
around suddenly, shouted at the 
militiamen, but was seized from be- 
hind by one of the workers. He was 
dragged to the ground and the men 
moved in, kicking at him. 

The militiamen were obviously 
trained for this kind of fighting, for 
they moved expertly and quickly, 
swinging their improvised clubs with 
great precision and accuracy. I 
watched for a moment, then joined 
the struggle, trying to reach Codings. 
One of the hired men grabbed at my 
face, his fingers closing over my eyes. 
I tried to snatch my head away, but 
he had helpers. Suddenly I was 
free— and saw two men who had 
attacked me fad. The militiamen who 
had rescued me made no sign of 
recognition, but carried on with their 
brutal clubbing. 

The crowd was swelling now, as 
other locals came to give assistance. I 
paid no heed to this and turned back 
into the thick of it, still trying to 
reach Codings. A narrow back was 
directly in front of me, clad in a thin 
white shirt sticking wetly to the skin. 
Unthinkingly I slammed my arm 
around the man’s throat, pulled his 
head back and punched him roughly 
in the ear. He dropped. Another man 
was beyond him and I tried the same 
tactic, but this time before I could 



land a blow I was kicked roughly and 
went down. 

Through the mass of legs I saw 
Codings ’s body on the ground, still 
being kicked. He was lying face 
down, his arms defensively over his 
head. I tried to push my way across 
to him, but then I too was being 
kicked. Another foot slammed 
against the side of my head, and for a 
moment I blacked out. A second 
later I was conscious again and, like 
Codings, I covered my head with my 
arms but pushed myself forward in 
the direction I had last seen him. 

Everything around me seemed to 
be a surging forest of legs and bodies 
and everywhere there was the roar of 
raised voices. Lifting my head for a 
moment I saw that I was only inches 
from Codings and pushed my way 
through until I was crouched on the 
ground beside him. I tried to stand, 
but was immediately felled by 
another kick. 

Much to my surprise I realized 
Codings was still conscous. As I fed 
against him I felt his arm go over my 
shoulders. 

“When I say,” he bawled in my 
ear, “stand up!” 

A moment passed and I felt his 
arm grip my shoulder more tightly. 

“Now!” 

With a massive effort we pushed 
ourselves upward and at once he 
released me, swinging his fist around 
and catching a man full in the face. I 
did not have his height and the best I 
could manage was an elbow-jab into 
someone’s stomach. For my trouble I 



56 



GALAXY 




was punched in the neck and once 
more fell. Someone grabbed me and 
hauled me to my feet.' It was Col- 
lings. 

“Hold it!” He put both his arms 
around me and pulled me erect. “It’s 
okay,” he said. “Hold on.” 

Gradually the jostling around us 
eased, then stopped. The men moved 
back. 

I was dazed and through a red mist 
building up in my sight I caught a 
glimpse of a circle of militiamen, 
their armed crossbows raised and 
aimed. The hired men were moving 
away. I passed out. 

I CAME around about a minute 
later. I was lying on the ground 
and one of the militiamen was stand- 
ing over me. 

“He’s okay,” he shouted and 
moved away. 

I rolled painfully onto my side and 
saw that a short distance away Col- 
lings and the leader of the militia 
were arguing angrily. About fifty 
yards from me the hired men were 
standing in a group, surrounded by 
the militiamen. 

I tried to stand up and managed it 
on my second attempt. Dazedly, I 
stood and watched while Codings 
continued to argue. In a moment the 
militia officer walked toward the 
group of prisoners and Codings came 
over to me. 

“How do you feel?” he said. 

I tried to grin, but my face was 
swollen and painful. All I could do 



was stare at him. He had a huge red 
bruise up one side of his face and his 
eye was beginning to close. I noticed 
that he held one arm around his 
waist. 

“I’m okay,” I said. 

“You’re bleeding.” 

“Where?” I raised my hand to my 
neck— which was hurting abomi- 
nably— and felt warm liquid. ColUngs 
moved over and looked at it. 

“It’s just a bad graze,” he said. 
“Do you want to go back to the city 
and have treatment?” 

“No.” I said. “What the hell hap- 
pened?” 

“The militia over-reacted. I 
thought I told you to bring four.” 
“They wouldn’t listen.” 

“I know— they’re like that.” 

“But what was it all about?” I 
said. “I’ve worked with those men 
for a long time and they’ve never 
attacked us before.” 

“There’s a lot of built-up resent- 
ment,” said Codings. “Specifically, in 
this case the problem was that three 
of the men have wives in the city. 
They weren’t going to leave without 
them.” 

“Those men are from the city?” I 
asked, not sure I had heard properly. 

“No-I said that their wives are 
there. These men are all locals, hired 
from a nearby village.” 

“That was what I thought. But 
what are their wives doing in the 
city?” 

“We bought them.”

C ARSON walked over to the side- 
port and looked out. There was 
nothing to see, but he looked any- 
way. He was thinking that it had 
finally come and that he was no 
more ready for it now than he had 
ever been. The thing old spacers 
feared but never talked about was 
happening to him. He was lost in the 
void with no chance of getting home 
and with a terrified commander who 
was getting ready to flip his lid. 

“It’s time we got out of here,” he 
said. 

“Get out where?” said Moore. His 
voice cracked and his eyelids 
fluttered up and down like little pale 
blinds that were out of control. 

“There’s a planet down there and 
we have a landing boat.” 

“No, we’ve got to stay here and 
wait. Someone will come along.” 

“We didn’t just run out of gas on a 
highway somewhere,” said Carson. 

The eyelids fluttered faster. 
“Don’t talk to me like that.” 

Carson started to say something 
but his mind went blank and he 
forgot the words. It didn’t matter. 
They couldn’t have been important. 
Once again he stared through the 
sideport at the empty black space 
that stretched in every direction. 
Now his mind was absolutely clear. 
Twenty minutes earlier he had been 
outside the ship, floating in that 
black space. He had gone out to 
hand-set a marking buoy. 

Right after he and Moore had 
spotted the planet they had checked 
for it on the map. It wasn’t there, so 



they had done what they were paid 
to do— prepared a buoy and Carson 
had gone out to send it on its way to 
orbit around the planet. The buoy 
emitted an FTL radio signal so the 
planet could be located whenever 
someone wanted to find it. 

Their small ship was like an infant 
kangaroo that was lost outside its 
mother’s pouch. Somewhere out in 
the void were the remains of the 
mother craft. Captain Larsen, fifty 
crewmen and the big, modern space- 
cruiser were dead. One minute the 
intercom had been chattering 
busily-the next had brought only 
silence. Like an umbilicus, the inter- 
com fed comfort and security to the 
small ship, assured its crew that when 
the work day was over they could 
return to the protection of the 
mother craft. 

When the intercom stopped signal- 
ing, Moore and Carson made re- 
peated attempts to reestablish com- 
munication. They failed and this 
meant only one thing. Something 
had happened to the big ship. The 
umbilicus was severed and the infant 
drifted helplessly. 

C ARSON turned away from the 
sideport and looked at the 
young man who was going to be his 
companion in death. Moore was his 
superior. No, Moore had been his 
superior. Now neither was top man. 
They were both subordinate to fate, 
Lady Luck, lousy circumstance. They 
had a landing boat and a few days’ 



59 




rations of food and water and they 
had an impassable stretch of distance 
between them and Earth. 

“You realize what this means,” he 
said. “There’s just you and me and 
what’s outside that window.” 

Moore jammed his eyes shut. 
“Shut up. Don’t talk.” 

Carson walked away. He began 
packing equipment and putting it 
into the little auxiliary boat. Moore 
followed him, dogged every footstep 
he took. 

“I’m not giving up.” 

“Who said anything about giving 
up?” said Carson. “We’re still alive.” 

“For what? What do you call 
being alive?” 

“Just plain breathing, if that’s all 
there is left to me. Somewhere you 
have to draw a line between what 
you want and what you’ll settle for.” 

“You don’t know what’s down 
there. Maybe there’s no air, maybe 
it’s too hot or all frozen. We may 
crash.” 

“Maybe,” said Carson. 

“We can’t risk it. Not until we’re 
sure. I don’t want to go down there. 
This is insanity. You’re insane. You 
should have been retired ten years 
ago. Why did they put me with an 
old man who’s lived his life? I’m 
twenty-three. I haven’t had any life 
at all.” 

“Get in the boat,” said Carson. He 
wondered what he would do if 
Moore refused. 

Emitting whimpers of despair, 
Moore climbed inside. Carson 
strapped himself into the pilot’s seat 



and released the auxiliary from the 
larger craft. They floated free and 
drifted away. 

He didn’t have much fuel. At 
exactly the same instant the instru- 
ments signaled a mass ahead he 
turned on the jets and took the boat 
into the planet’s atmosphere. 

It looked worse than bad. Where 
was the sun? There was nothing but 
fog, nothing but gray mist prowling 
ahead of them, ugly and impossible 
to see through. No sunlight, no trees 
or flowers or vegetables, probably no 
animal life. 

He stiffened as Moore made a little 
gasping sound. Quickly he examined 
the screen, and then he saw it. 

“An ocean,” said Moore. 

It looked like no ocean Carson had 
ever seen. It seemed endless. From 
the looks of it, they were coming 
down during a seasonal storm or this 
world was one big hurricane. Colossal 
waves rose and smashed together, 
formed snowy fringes that erupted 
into the sky and sprayed the boat 
with hard jets of water. 

“We’re nearly out of fuel,” said 
Moore. 

Through the fog Carson saw a 
dead-white shadow that looked like a 
stretch of beach. He gave the brake 
rockets a blast and prepared for a 
landing. Moore suddenly yelled and 
grabbed his arm. He dropped faster 
than he had intended. 

He tried to avoid the dune that 
leaped up in front of the screen, but 
he was too late. The boat’s bottom 
scraped several yards of sandy rock 



60 



GALAXY 




off the dune and gave up a sizable 
section of her hull. 

It turned out to be a fortunate 
accident. If they hadn’t hit the dune, 
they would have plowed into the 
bordering ocean that began a mile 
from where the first one ended. 
Their impetus was slowed by the 
partial collision and Carson was able 
to land short of a row of angry 
waves. 

It took him a shaky minute to 
realize they were down. His hands 
dropped from the controls and he sat 
frozen in his seat and listened to the 
whistling sound of air escaping from 
the chamber. 

Cautiously, he took a sniff. “I 
smell sulfur.” He looked at Moore. 
“It’s all right. The air is good. 
Doesn’t smell so sweet, but it’s good. 
I think.” 

The lights in the ceiling flickered 
and grew dim. 

“You work on the power box 
while I take a look at the hull,” 
Carson said. 

Moore lay inert, his eyes fixed on 
the screen. 

“Get up. Do as 1 say!” 

While the younger man fumbled 
his way out of his seat, Carson 
shifted supplies to cover the hole in 
the hull. Most of the damage was in 
the rear. Two cases of food tins had 
dropped out when they hit the sand. 

Wherever they were now, they 
were gone, along with the flashlights, 
flares and mattresses. 

He scratched his stubbled cheeks 
and thought about what was outside. 



“There isn’t more than a mile of 
beach between those oceans,” he 
said. “It must be no more than a 
sand bar. We’ll be able to take a look 
outside at dawn.” He lay down on 
his seat and stared at the screen. His 
stomach complained. There was one 
carton of rations between them. 

T HE medical belt strapped around 
his waist pinched him and he 
shifted position. While he watched 
for any movement on the beach, he 
thought about the belt. Back on a 
planet called Earth a man named 
Stanton had fastened the belt on 
Carson’s body and had said a few 
things as he did so. 

“Don’t ever take it off. No matter 
what happens, wear it.” 

“Sounds important,” Carson had 
said. 

“Call it the Physician. It’s minia- 
ture but mighty. It knows every alien 
bug we’ve ever picked up. Nothing 
can kill you.” 

“Barring death?” 

Stanton hadn’t smiled. “We don’t 
know the Physician’s limitations. 
You aren’t feeling any pricks but it’s 
putting monitor wires into every 
essential part of your body. It carries 
more cures than you ever heard of. It 
can think, diagnose, prescribe and 
deal out the medicine.” 

“Sounds like a miracle worker.” 
“It’s the Physician.” 

“The master of my body?” said 
Carson. 

“Maybe more than that,” said 
Stanton. 



UNBIASED GOD 



61 




“You mean my soul, too?” 

“Make jokes. The Physician exists 
to keep you alive. Your suit is 
supposed to protect you from alien 
environments. What happens if the 
suit springs a leak? Pressure, heat, 
gas, chemicals-the Physician can 
prep your body to resist them if you 
aren’t exposed to them too quickly.” 

“What about something that kills 
me slowly?” 

“It won’t,” said Stanton. 

“You’re sure you aren’t dream- 
ing?” 

“I know what went into this thing. 
What I don’t know is exactly how 
good it is. But it was made to keep 
you alive and it will do its job come 
hell or . .” 

The last thought made Carson jerk 
upright in his seat. Damn Stanton 
and the medical belt. There were no 
problems of pressure or heat here, 
only the big ones of certain starva- 
tion and probably more alien bugs 
than a computer could count. 

He looked at his watch and rea- 
lized he must have dozed. It was 
growing lighter outside and he could 
make out the waves thundering onto 
the beach. Moore was doing exercises 
in the space between the seats. 

Carson got up, went to the rear of 
the cabin and opened the food case. 
There had been eighteen tins the last 
time he checked. Now there were six. 
All the beef was gone. He turned and 
looked at Moore. 

The younger man’s breath sent 
puffs of vapor into the air as he did 
knee bends. Strain and desperation 

62 



were on his face. He tried to finish a 
bend and get upright again. At the 
last moment he grabbed one of the 
seats and threw himself across it. 

A wave of dizziness hit Carson. He 
swayed. “I expect you to share those 
cans of beef with me.” 

Moore lay on the seat with his 
head buried in his arms. “I need 
more food than you.” 

“We’re going to share it— right 
down to the last bite.” 

Moore only buried his head deeper 
in his arms. 

Carson opened two tins of fruit 
and ate. After that he pulled his hat 
down over his ears, stepped out of 
the cabin and pressed the steel door 
shut behind him. 



H E WASN’T prepared for the 
wind. It was full of hard rain 
that found its way into every open- 
ing in his clothing. The sound of it 
was worse. Its screech, as it hurtled 
across the beach at him, entered his 
head like a million knives. He stag- 
gered away from the boat and at the 
same time tore pieces from his hand- 
kerchief and stuffed them in his ears. 
This muffled the sound a bit so that 
instead of tearing his head apart it 
rumbled up and down every nerve in 
his spine. 

His feet made holes in the sand as 
he walked along the saturated beach. 
Behind him stretched a line of 
puddles. The ocean was a heaving 
mass. Whitecaps rose in the air and 
ran toward him. He gave up trying to 



GALAXY 




protect his face from the spray. 
There was no defense against such a 
planet. There had to be germs in his 
body, old and new, and the Physician 
must be working overtime right now. 
It was all a waste of time. There were 
no cures for hunger and fear. 

The beach was dotted with dunes 
and he sat on one and thought for a 
long while. What about a raft? A 
useless idea. Even if there was any- 
thing on this world besides oceans 
and sandbars he and Moore would 
drown before they got a hundred 
yards from shore. 

His legs grew numb with cold and 
he realized water had soaked through 
his pants. It poured into his boots as 
he stood up. Sick and miserable, he 
dropped his chin to his chest and 
shut his eyes. There was no way out. 
This little wet patch was going to be 
his grave. 

He shuffled back to the boat and 
knocked on the hatch. The sound 
was absorbed by the wind and he 
knocked harder. He sensed move- 
ment on the other side of the panel, 
knew Moore was standing there with 
his face touching the cold steel, 
listening to him. He thundered on 
the hull with his fist. 

“Go away,” yelled Moore. 

“Open up.” 

“No.” 

Carson swayed. The wind knocked 
him off his feet into a puddle. He 
scrambled up and threw himself at 
the boat. “Let me in.” 

“Pay me first,” cried Moore. 

Carson bent down and a quart of 



water flushed from his coat collar. 
Placing his hands on the hull, he 
pushed and kicked. 

Fog licked at his neck. The 
wind at his back became hands that 
tried to pull him down to the sand 
where it could lash him to shreds; the 
howling gale became a single shriek 
that threatened to shatter his brain. 
His fear built shapes that stalked him 
through the mist. They took hold of 
him with inhuman fingers, drew him 
away from the boat. He heard a 
sniffling sound. Pushing his face into 
the storm, he opened his eyes wide. 
He found himself crouched on the 
sand with his body turned to the 
water, and he realized that his legs 
were making weak movements for- 
ward. He screamed and leaped at the 
boat. 

“Let me in!” 

“Two cans of food,” said Moore. 

Again he smashed at the panel. 

“The food should be mine,” said 
Moore. 

His fists were bruised and bleed- 
ing. “Two cans,” he gasped. 

“No, by God, I want it all!” 

“You can have it all.” 

The door swung open. A heavy 
boot caught him in the face as he fell 
forward. 



I T SEEMED that a long time 
passed before he came to con- 
sciousness. When he opened his eyes 
he found Moore on his knees beside 
him, staring intently down at him. 
There was a gun in Moore’s hand and 



UNBIASED GOD 



63 




there was fear in his eyes. 

“You stopped breathing for about 
five minutes. I knew you were alive, 
but you weren’t breathing.” 

“Get away from me.” 

“How could you do it? How could 
you live without breathing?” Moore 
began to make gagging sounds. 
Putting his hand over his mouth, he 
started to heave. 

Carson grabbed the gun and 
climbed to his feet. He threw the gun 
at the wall, fell onto his seat and held 
his aching head. 

“I’m sick,” Moore gasped. 

Carson closed his eyes. His head 
hurt, his stomach ached and he 
couldn’t seem to get enough air into 
his lungs. 

Staggering to his seat, Moore 
dropped into it like a limp bundle, 
“You were so worried about the 
food. You needn’t have been. It 
makes you sick to eat.” 

“We can’t be sick,” said Carson. 
“We’re wearing the medical belts. 
We’re just in a state of shock.” 

“This whole planet is in a state of 
shock. It doesn’t like human beings.” 
“It’s just another planet.” 

Moore leaned over, stared at him. 
“How do you feel? Inside, I mean.” 
“Cold, hungry, thirsty, miserable.” 
“I feel like a balloon that’s about 
ready to pop. The pressure is all 
through me, in my legs, my arms, my 
chest and head. I keep thinking the 
next breath will finally do it, open 
that hole in the top of my skull and 
everything inside will go up like a 
firecracker. I start to pick up some- 



thing and suddenly my fingers don’t 
work— or I start to scratch myself 
and I find the itch is in my fingers or 
my arms— or it’s inside my brain 
where I can’t get at it—” 

“Shut up,” said Carson. 

“You feel it. You’re scared, like 
me. If it hadn’t been for you I 
wouldn’t be here, but I can’t kill you 
because I don’t want to be left 
alone.” 

“We’re both scared. If you’d get 
hold of yourself we might be able to 
figure something out.” 

“We don’t have a prayer. There 
isn’t anything on this planet but 
water.” 

“Go to sleep,” said Carson. He 
closed his eyes, made himself lie flat 
on the seat. Exhaustion swarmed 
over him and he felt himself slipping 
down a dark slope toward sleep. He 
forced himself awake long enough 
to take a look at Moore. The other 
man lay on his back, his eyes shut. 
He looked dead. His chest was still. 
He wasn’t breathing. But Carson 
knew he was alive. 

Once he sat up, torn from a sound 
sleep, to find Moore fumbling at him. 
“Did you hear it?” 

“What?” said Carson. 

“Someone called me.” 

“I was talking in my sleep.” 

“It wasn’t you.” 

Carson dreamed he was lost in a 
black cloud, his weightless body 
drowned in fog. Stretching his legs, 
he felt his foot touch something. 
Frantically he groped for it. His 
fingers reached out, his body ex-

tended. He got out of his seat and 
stood up. 

“Where are you going?” said 
Moore, his voice frightened. 

“Home.” 

“I am awake.” 

He opened the door. Moore leaped 
from his seat and gave him a violent 
shove. 

“Go, damn you! Whatever is out 
there can have you, but it won’t get 



C ARSON pitched forward to the 
sand. Water filled his mouth. 
Wind swooped into his ears. Spray 
lashed his face. He awoke with a 
scream. Staggering to his feet, he 
walked toward the ocean. His foot 
touched the roiling surf. He took one 
last breath before going into the 
waves. Water closed over his head 
and the tide grabbed his legs and 
drew him down into a dark universe 
of suffocating pain. As he opened his 
mouth to inhale and put an end to 
the pain, something encircled his 
waist and began to take him upward 
and away from the grave. He 
struggled, but the arm was too 
strong. 

Abruptly he felt the wind on his 
face. He was still fighting as he was 
taken from the sea and carried 
ashore. There came a steady pressure 
on his back and then he forgot 
everything in his struggle to keep 
from choking to death. 

At last he rolled onto his back and 
looked up. There were two of them, 



and their brown, scaly skins shone in 
the dim light. The scales shifted as 
they moved. Each stood six feet tall 
on two legs that ended in broad, 
web-toed feet. Each hand had three 
webbed digits. The heads were large. 
The eyes protruded. There were 
double indentations for nostrils. 
They had wide mouths and jutting 
chins. Long slits opened and closed 
where their ears would have been, 
had they been human, and similar 
slits moved on their sides. 

“Fish,” said a hoarse, insane voice. 
Moore came swiftly across the sand, 
the gun in one hand up and aimed 
and before Carson could cry out, the 
shot sounded. One of the aliens 
dropped to the sand without making 
a sound. Its companion stepped back 
but made no attempt to escape. 

“Goddamn you, you killed it,” 
cried Carson. 

“What did you think I meant to 
do?” Moore asked as he scrambled 
on over the sand. “Keep your eye on 
that other one.” He grabbed a knife 
from his pocket, lunged onto the 
fallen creature and carved a deep line 
in its leg. Hacking off a chunk of 
flesh, he raised it to his nose and 
sniffed. With a curse, he hurled it 
away. “Stinking animal,” he yelled 
and drove his knife into the carcass. 

The other creature sprang at him 
and wrapped its fingers around his 
throat. Moore sank the knife into its 
shoulder as he fell. Yanking it free, 
he raised it to stab again. Carson 
hurtled forward, hit him with a fist 
and knocked him onto his back. The 



UNBIASED GOD 



65 




creature tried to reach Moore’s 
throat and Carson took it by the leg 
and hauled it away a few yards. He 
turned just as Moore rushed him. 
This time he punched with all his 
strength. 

Moore lay on his side, blood gush- 
ing from his nose. For an instant he 
looked as if he were going to attack 
again. Instead he turned onto his 
stomach and crawled away toward 
the boat. 

Carson knelt beside the wounded 
creature. The inner sheath of its 
double-lidded eyes slid up and down 
as it watched him. He shivered and 
tried to shield his face from the wind 
with his coat collar. As he reached to 
touch the scaly body a sudden pain 
ripped through his chest. He 
coughed, vomited. Clawing at his 
throat, he fell across the creature and 
blacked out. 

Two alien hands were kneading his 
back and neck when he regained 
consciousness. He rolled over. The 
alien stayed beside him, blinking its 
double-lidded eyes and gently blow- 
ing water from its gill-ears. It 
watched him with quiet interest. 

“Get out of here,” Carson said 
weakly. “That crazy Moore will kill 
you just for fun.” 

The alien blew water and kept its 
eyes on his face. 

“You’re in the wrong place to 
have that big head,” Carson whis- 
pered. “Who ever heard of a fish with 
brains?” He drew his knees to his 
chest to relieve the pain in his stom- 
ach. Spray slapped his bare head. 



He hunched against a dune and 
tried to wish he were dead, but 
within him a spark of insanity flared 
and he knew he wanted to live. He 
kept seeing fields of Earth shimmer- 
ing in heat waves, deserts scorched 
from the sun, pots boiling over open 
fires. 

He hated to let go. There were still 
things he had to think about, ques- 
tions he wanted to find answers to, 
places he wanted to go. 

“I don’t need you,” he said to the 
alien. He pointed to the ocean. “Go 
on, get out of here. Go home.” The 
creature obeyed. With fluid motions 
it turned and entered the water. 



C ARSON lay back, careless of the 
fact that the wind and spray 
battered his unprotected face. It 
made no difference. He was too old, 
too human, too fragile to meet this 
planet on its own terms and survive. 

He thought of Stanton, spoke 
aloud to a man millions of light years 
away. “What now, mister miracle 
worker? There’s no cure for the 
incurable, you know. Why did you 
waste your breath? But it’s funny. 
Even at this stage of the game, I can’t 
help wondering. A machine, being a 
narrow-minded idiot, doesn’t know 
when to quit. What does it do when 
its primary function turns out to be 
impossible? Does it have a nervous 
breakdown? I wonder . .” 

He must have slept, for when he 
opened his eyes the faint light in the 
sky was nearly gone. He was aston- 



66 



GALAXY 




ished that he was still alive. A cau- 
tious inventory of what he was feel- 
ing inside made him sit up in be- 
wildered alarm. It wasn’t possible 
that he could feel so well. He ought 
to be burning up with fever, ought to 
be lying in the mud and hacking out 
his lungs. 

He started to get up and felt the 
seat of his pants rip. Carefully, he 
stood up straight. For a moment he 
swayed with vertigo and then a warm 
glow began to radiate inside him. 
New energy flowed through his back 
and legs. It scared him. It wasn’t 
normal. He liked it, but it was wrong. 
He should be dead, stretched out in 
t he puddles like a wet sock. 

“What the hell?” he said. 
“What’s—” 

Something happened to his voice. 
He opened his mouth to yell, but he 
couldn’t make a sound. His jacket 
gripped him across the chest like a 
vise and he took a few stumbling 
steps, tried to curse. He tore off the 
jacket and threw it to the ground. 
Before he had time to tell himself 
(hat he had lost his mind his feet 
began to hurt. The boots were crush- 
ing them. 

Hopping in awkward circles, he rid 
himself of his confining clothes. 
When the wind swooped upon him 
he snarled at his insanity and tried to 
put the boots back on. All at once he 
stood .still. He trembled with shock. 
His heart pounded. 

Alter a long look at the foot he 
had been trying to ram into his boot 
he sat on the sand with his arms 



wrapped across his chest. Finally he 
had another look. His foot was turn- 
ing a dark brown color. Between the 
thickening toes a sheath of skin was 
beginning to form. 

He fell face down in the sand and 
covered his head with his arms. He 
wanted to crawl inside the planet, 
conceal himself in it, hide from the 
atmosphere, the light, his own 
horror. He dug in with his toes and 
felt the sand grate against the new 
skin growing there. He had a disease 
the Physician couldn’t combat. Not 
once had he believed the machine 
was a miracle worker— and he had 
been right. 

He raised his head and looked into 
the dim light and the planet closed 
about him like a living thing. Death 
moved up close and he squeezed his 
eyes shut and waited for the terror 
that would come. 

Narrow-minded machine— give it 
several orders but make one the most 
important: keep this mortal package 
alive. Put all the elements you could 
think of at its disposal; narrow- 
minded machine would naturally 
play God. 

Master of my body, master of my 
soul. I have only one being. Not two. 
A master of one is the master of the 
other. Have I got that correct? Have I 
forgotten something? 

I N THE chill gray light of the 
reality around him he abandoned 
Earth and all it had meant to him. 
There would be no escape from this 



UNBIASED GOD 



67 




world. Earth was another dimension 
that would never come his way again. 
They no longer belonged to one 
another. 

His body lengthened and filled 
out. The pores of his flesh opened 
and grew new tissue, a tough and 
durable material that cut the wind’s 
brutality and accepted it like a balmy 
breeze. 

He stood on his feet, naked but 
rapidly becoming clothed with the 
exterior that he needed in order to 
survive. Death fled away from him 
and he laughed without sound. 

He looked at the boat and the 
thought came to him that he had to 
go to Moore, tell him what was 
happening, make him understand 
that this was what Carson had meant 
when he said that somewhere a man 
had to draw a line between what he 
wanted and what he would settle for. 

Effortlessly he ran across the sand 
toward the boat, raised a hand to rap 
against the panel. His hand froze in 
the air. Sorrow billowed in him as he 
stared through the open door at the 
figure stretched out on the cabin 
floor. The gun still in his fist, Moore 
had a little bloody hole between his 
eyes. 

Taking the gun from the limp 
fingers, Carson laid it aside and 
examined Moore’s hand. He saw the 
telltale broadening of the palm, the 
web that had begun to form by the 
thumb, the darkening of the skin. 

He left the boat and swung the 
door shut behind him for the last 
time. For long minutes he stood 



looking at the craft that had brought 
him and the dead boy so far from the 
mother ship. Moore had believed that 
being a conformist was more impor- 
tant than being alive. 

The spray washed over him with 
exhilarating touches, the wind 
cooled his body while he waited on 
the sand. The muted sounds of the 
planet were music to his mind. He 
waited, breathing softly at first and 
then not breathing at all. When it was 
finished, he knew, and he looked 
down at himself. What he saw 
pleased him well enough. It was a 
good body and not unhandsome to 
his eyes. 

The medical belt felt a little tight. 
With a flick of a finger, he loosened 
it a notch. He stared up at the fog. 
Somewhere out there in the void 
spun a small green planet. The people 
on it didn’t know the exact meaning 
of life and for the first time in their 
existence they hadn’t insisted that 
they did. They created a thinking 
machine that owned an open-ended 
philosophy. The Physician had no 
prejudices. 

Had Stanton known? Maybe he 
had guessed. If the Physician would 
not allow a man to die . but this 
sounded like such a preposterous 
boast. Yet, suppose it were fact. 

What if ? 

Carson walked toward the ocean 
with an eager step. The sky was dark, 
and the spray lashed the barren 
beach as the newly born being sank 
into the depths of his new world.

BOOKSHELF 




T HE most surprising writer I’ve 
run across in years is Angela 
Carter. One might also say “colorful” 
and “unusual” and a good number of 
other things, including just plain 
“good.” But “surprising” is exactly 
the right word, all through Heroes 
and Villains (Pocket Books, 95c). 
When people speak in her work, you 
don’t know what they’re going to 
say; when they act, you will be 
surprised at what they do. There are 
many other good things about Ms. 
Carter’s attack on narrative -her vivid 
color, her familiarity with her scene, 
the unexpectedness of her characters 
and plot development— but it is the 
recurrent surprise that is her hall- 
mark. This book was published three 
years ago in hard covers and well 
over a year ago in paperback and I 
did not see it at the time of either 



release, but damned if I’ll withhold a 
review of it for that reason— it’s too 
good a book and you deserve it. The 
publishers list three other books by 
Angela Carter; I must assume that 
they are mainstream— whatever that 
really means— but this one, (surpris- 
ingly) called on the cover “a gothic 
fantasy of the future,” deals with a 
post-holocaust situation in which a 
few neat stockaded villages have been 
organized by Professors— anachron- 
istic research scientists and educators 
with their own militia— and an out- 
side world of raiding barbarians and 
certain others— mutated, sick, rotten, 
horrible. The story is Marianne’s. She 
grew up, daughter of a Professor, in 
one of the villages and was a witness, 
more than once, to raids, until one 
day, not quite against her will, she 
rode off with the raiders . and not

one more word do you get from me 
about the story. About the wander- 
ing-across-the-line of mainstream 
writers, however— and the wandering 
goes both ways— I have nothing but 
applause. Personally I have always 
felt uneasy with the hardline, stone- 
wall definitions of sf, a field toward 
which I was drawn originally because 
it seemed to have no horizons, no 
limits at all, like poetry. I’ll have 
more to say about that later, but for 
the moment the surprising Ms. Carter 
gives us an excellent reason for dis- 
solving barriers. Heroes and Villains 
leaves me parched for more Carter, 
and lo on her flyleaf are the names of 
three more works: Honeybuzzard, 
The Magic Toyshop, and Several Per- 
ceptions. I shall cross that barrier, if 
indeed there be one, to find and read 
these books, and may denizens of the 
deeps of the mainstream, baited by 
something we have done, be led to 
paddle over here. We’ll all benefit. 

ANOTHER fine delineator of char- 
il acter is Robert Wells, whose 
Right-handed Wilderness (Ballantine, 
$1.25) is a real find. Meet Shroud, 
aging, loving doctor, and the urgent, 
earnest macho investigator Bart Reve 
(“Don’t call me Mister Reve. I am 
not half a man; don’t use half my 
name.”). And above all, Selinda, 
whose love for and with Shroud is 
something to wonder at and wish for 
(let the prepositions fall where they 
may). The closely woven strands of 
his intricate plot leave no loose 
ends— overall, it makes no preten- 



sions beyond melodrama and it is 
that of the highest order. The science 
aspect is ingenious, unusual, reason- 
able and provocative. It’s the kind of 
book that makes a buck and a 
quarter worthwhile outlay— you pay 
more for a lousy movie. 

I N A peculiar and doubtless unjust 
way I am getting a little bugged at 
Roger Elwood. He has so many 
contracts going with so many pub- 
lishers that he threatens to corner the 
anthology market, driving out other 
anthologists with other approaches. I 
would hate to see him, at his very 
best, threatening my access to Silver- 
berg, Disch, Knight, Carr, or Harri- 
son/ Aldiss, just to blurt out an in- 
complete list. Yet it must be said on 
the hardworking Mr. E’s behalf that 
he has been able to bug certain 
publishers, some of them small, re- 
mote and unknown to most of us, to 
enter the sf area, to their benefit and 
certainly, by expansion of the 
market, to the benefit of the writers. 
And an argument bridging both 
points of view, pro and con: does the 
proliferation of anthologies make the 
cream at the top creamier— or dilute 
it? Do the anthos make it tougher for 
the magazines, or are they better 
because so much of the slush-pile is 
drawn off to the books? Well— 
wherever the argument goes, what- 
ever the fate of either outlet, boom, 
bubble or bust, the fact remains that 
when Elwood comes up with a good 
one it’s very good indeed viz .Future 
City (Trident Press, $7.95). Will you

look at this cast of characters: Fore- 
word by Simak, afterword by Pohl, 
and in between, original stories and 
poems by Disch, Bova, Offutt, Jani- 
fer (a welcome rarity, Janifer), Malz- 
berg and O’Donnell (how about 
that?!), Lafferty, Bill Nolan, Koontz, 
D. M. Price, the Bilkers, Virginia 
Kidd (where you been?), Scortia (a 
harsh hard heavy one, this), Frank 
Herbert, Zebrowski, Silverberg, Hens- 
ley, Robin Schaeffer (a fine tiny 
sharp little thing), Thomas F. Monte- 
leone and Harlan Ellison. So many of 
these stories are downbeat, some 
speak of hopelessness— and yet for 
most of them there’s an underlying 
regard for the city and what it 
means, has meant to all of us. More 
than one of these authors say the 
city stands, the people die . but 
they say it with respect. Some say 
the city dies, the people die, too. 
Some say the city dies but the people 
live. Reading all the way through to 
Pohl’s beautifully written afterword 
is quite an experience . and let no 
one, at any stage of argument, say 
Elwood can’t put together a big one. 

T ERRY CARR certainly ranks as 
one of the most proficient 
editors in the business. What he looks 
for— further, what he gets by finding, 
by persuasion, by demonstration and 
sometimes, I think, by an almost 
unholy luck— is a kind of literate and 
thought-provoking story bearing a 
special texture. He cares about 
science and about fiction and about 
science-fiction; his parameters for the

latter are rather more broad and 
inclusive than many of his col- 
leagues’, which is, I think, a good 
thing. In any case, his personal stamp 
on an anthology is as distinctive as a 
fingerprint and, after having read two 
of them, you could spot a third with 
the titles worn off. Universe 3 (Ran- 
dom House $5.95) demonstrates the 
point brilliantly. A long novelette by 
Gene Wolf is a triumph of the unex- 
pected, full of disturbing disorienta- 
tions, both for characters and the 
reader— and yet is flawlessly consis- 
tent. It’s called The Death of Doctor 
Island and will surely be in the 
running at award-time. In addition 
there are stories by Effinger, Silver-

fable by Ross Rocklynne (who was 
writing sf before most of his readers 
were born), a brand-new Pangborn— 
always something to celebrate— writ- 
ing about the possibility, some time 
after the “Davy” period, that the 
world may be round. Then there’s Ed 
Bryant and Gordon Eklund, each 
with a fantastic female, each with her 
special passions and compassions. All 
original, of course, and when I say 
original I mean just that. 

D ID you ever hear of a book 
called A Wrinkle in Time'} 1 
happen to know a little of the 
back-story on that, and tell it some- 
times when I teach writing and some- 
times to zap beginning writers who 
are sulky after a rejection. Madeleine 
L’Engel wrote it, after selling one 
mainstream novel which was what’s 
called a “critical success,” which 
means nobody made any money, but 
at least the writer is now an Author. 
Miss L’Engle then wrote Wrinkle— 
not for any special market or genre, 
but just writing well a story she cared 
about. She submitted it and it 
bounced. It bounced again and still 
again— it was rejected successively by 
28 publishers. No misprint that— I 
said two dozen plus four. Her hus- 
band was— is— an actor, and things at 
that time were not so dewy in show 
biz either, so they both said the hell 
with it, writing and acting both and, 
scraping up every available sou, they 
opened a crossroads general store in 
the wilds of Connecticut. Nine years 
later something moved Miss L’ to 



resubmit the book and it hit. It also 
won the Newbery Medal as the best 
children’s book of the year, which 
says something about book awards 
and I suppose about the contempo- 
rary child as well. It wasn’t written 
to be a children’s book; what it is is 
science fiction of the finest kind, 
where the science is intriguing and 
the people in it real and care-able 
about. Anyway it was followed by 
The Arm of the Starfish and now by 
A Wind in the Door (Farrar, Straus & 
Giroux, $4.95) and I urge you to get 
these books and read them. It’s high 
time and past time that this truly 
beautiful writer gets the recognition 
in our field which she deserves. 

A CONCENTRATION of Robert 
l Silverberg is a heady experience 
indeed. He is completely a liberated 
writer, by which I mean . Well, 
let’s put it this way. I carry with me 
at all times a silver symbol, the letter 
Q with an arrow through it, the name 
of which is “Ask the next question.” 
It means that no matter how good a 
situation may be in which you find 
yourself, there is some significant 
question that may be asked— and 
you’d better ask it, because if you 
don’t, or if you can’t find it, you’re 
dead. And if you ever reason yourself 
through to an answer and you can’t 
or won’t ask the next question, you 
have ceased to be alive. It means 
what Charles Fort meant when he 
wrote, “Any answer is not neces- 
sarily the only answer.” The symbol 
is that of all that is ongoing, mutable, 



72 



GALAXY 




life-oriented and fearlessly curious, 
beyond prejudice or preconception. 
So: Robert Silverberg’s mind seems 
to have been branded with this 
symbol and it glows through every- 
thing he has written recently. It 
certainly illuminates the contents of 
Unfamiliar Territory (Scribner’s, 
$5.95), a collection of 13 of his 
previously published stories. (The 
galleys I have do not indicate if any 
of these are original; but some are 
new to me.) Some, like the cele- 
brated Good News from the Vatican, 
you may know well; one, In 
Entropy’s Jaws, is quite the most 
fascinating exposition of the nature 
of time that I have ever read. There 
isn’t a bad story in the lot; Silverberg 
can, I think, do anything he wants to 
do except that. 

A RECENT conversation I had with 
L our new Managing Editor dealt 
partly with my basic view of sf— what 
it is I look for in the books and 
stories I read; or, when you come 
right down to it, what my definition 
of science fiction is. Well, I think you 
have a right to know. 

I wrote an essay for the New York 
Times Book Review a while back, the 
thrust of which was that no defini- 
tion to date fails to leak, and that the 
nature of the beast is that it can’t be 
defined. On the strength of this I was 
asked by the Encyclopedia Ameri- 
cana to write an article for them 
defining it. Well, I tried my best, and 
essentially what I wrote was this: 
that if you go to the dictionary for 



the definition of the word fiction, 
you’ll get fairly satisfactory answers, 
but if you look up science you will 
get (as in the big Random House 
Dictionary) six definitions which 
deal with systems and systematics, 
with the arrangement and methodol- 
ogy of data. I found this profoundly 
unsatisfactory; I can think of a long 
list of truly great sf which does not 
immediately concern itself with these 
strictures. So I went further and 
looked into the etymology of the 
word “science” and found that it 
derives from the Latin scientia, 
which means, not “method” nor 
“system” but knowledge. The con- 
cept of sf as “Knowledge Fiction” 
satisfies me completely. It permits 
the inclusion, for example, of Lord 
of the Flies in the sf category be- 
cause of its profound investigation of 
the origins of religion and secular 
power in a human society; it even 
puts Kurt Vonnegut where (dammit) 
he belongs. 

I have this addendum, one of 
those vague but poignant definitions 
like “Love is when . .”: If you have 
a story and yank out the science 
(knowledge) aspects, and the story 
falls apart, it was sf. If you have a 
story and yank out the science 
(knowledge) aspects and a story still 
exists, then you have that cowboy 
story that occurs on Mars instead of 
in Texas. 

All of which I have said before 
elsewhere, but perhaps it’s worth 
repeating here. See you next month.

SWEET SISTER, 
GREEN BROTHER 




This struggle for survival had all 
the beauty of love. Would encroaching 
man upset the delicate balance? 



SYDNEY J. VAN SCYOC 



In one arm of the universe 
the sylvan globe of Narr spins 
in the gravity web of a small 
red sun. This realm, which is at 
once environment and being, 
home and inhabitant, is a 
planet cloaked largely in close- 
lying broad-leafed vegetation 
that hugs the moist soil, pro- 
tecting it from the thirsty 
breezes and drying winds that 
skirmish Narr’s surface. There 
are trees here, too, that loop 
and scallop across the face of 
the planet in long unbroken 



77 




bands. These bands intercon- 
nect, so that nowhere do they 
have beginning or end. 

The trees grow thick, shel- 
tering broad channels that 
carry water. And if one posses- 
ses a certain awareness, step- 
ping beneath the trees one will 
perceive that these waters offer 
a murmurous refrain as they 
pass. Shelter me, green brother, 
they say. I bathe your roots in 
moisture. I receive your life’s 
fluid when the sky kingdom 
Fliiyr threatens. So spread 
strong limbs to shield my vul- 
nerable body. I am your flow- 
ing sister. 

And if one brings awareness, 
one will perceive that the trees 
answer, Flow, sweet sister. 
Bring me the moisture I crave. 
When Fliiyr rumbles, receive 
my precious essence and carry 
it safely in your arms. See how 
I defend you? I am your green 
brother. 

This is the communion that 
passes from trees to waters and 
back again, a murmurous re- 
frain that has comforted and 
reassured through the ages. But 
today’s green brother’s sentinel 
leaves send down intelligence. 
There is a change in the air. 
Light lessens. Fliiyr’s restless 
breezes draw back into still- 
ness. And there are other, more 
subtle and ominous indica- 
tions. 

Storm threatens. The trees 



know immediately. Their capil- 
laries contract. The precious 
fluids of life are expressed, 
boiling out into the soil, from 
there quickly joining sweet sis- 
ter in her channel. Receive, 
sister, the trees plead with 
woody urgency. Cherish these 
fluids in safety until I can 
drink them back. Storm is 
near. 

The waters swell and thick- 
en, becoming dark. I cherish, 
brother.. Protect me . 

The sky rumbles. The air 
darkens. The voices of Fliiyr 
bellow across the land, crack- 
ling, damning. Jagged white 
fingers reach down. Winds ap- 
pear, howling from dry throats. 

Fluid safely discharged, the 
trees hunch stolidly between 
sweet sister and the skvborne 
menace. There is no inter- 
change between brother and 
sister now. There is only fear. 
Storm stalks and hunts across 
Narr. 

I 

B ARRETT paced settlement 
grounds. Her party had stepped 
asoil six hours ago to greet its new 
surroundings with tense-lipped 
silence. Now, at midafternoon, indi- 
vidual members continued to dart 
uneasy glances at the sky. Barrett 
looked up. The sun was a rose-red 
egglet in a pale violet sky. The 
ground where they erected the first 



78 



GALAXY 




domes was flat, densely carpeted 
with unremarkable vegetation. A line 
of trees grew in the near distance. 
Deep beneath the trees flowed the 
stream from which they already drew 
drinking water. Certainly there was 
nothing here to stimulate anxiety. 

Conversely everything was here. 
There was the jarring unfamiliarity of 
open space, of harsh sunlight that 
lanced the eyes, of drinking water 
that carried no expected chemical 
taint. And there was the emptiness of 
an uninhabited world, the terrible 
barren stillness that dissolved every 
uttered word, purging it from exis- 
tence. 

Cham Diallo, slight, his head 
shaven except for a single long braid, 
approached, prayer robe on his arm. 
He offered: “I am ready to inspect 
the fields, Headsw’an.” 

Deliberately Barrett relaxed taut 
facial muscles. “Good.” She un- 
moored the hoverscooter. Lofting, 
she held the scooter briefly above 
settlement grounds. The headsman’s 
dome was already fully assembled. 
Three of the twelve dorms would be 
up before dark. Satisfied, she took 
the scooter planet-north. 

Native vegetation had been burned 
back from the edges of the pre- 
plowed acreage. Landing, Barrett 
paced across the scorched apron. As 
she bent to study the exposed soil 
she was keenly aware of responsibil- 
ity. The settlers had been provided 
with food, materials and supplies 
sufficient to insure survival for five 
years. Within those five years, they 



must prove they could survive here 
indefinitely by their own efforts. 
Otherwise they would be returned to 
the warrens of CityAmerica and to 
the bottom of the planet-party list, 
those of them who chose to try 
again. 

Barrett stood. We’ll make this 
world produce, she vowed. She 
turned. Diallo, prayer robe on his 
shoulders, was kneeling. 

When he rose she spoke briskly. 
“We’ll hike the agtechs out tomor- 
row. Offhand I don’t foresee any 
amendment to Klass’s cultivation 
schedule.” 

They had already lofted again 
when Diallo drew her attention to 
the sky behind them. Minutes before 
it had been pale violet. Now it was 
purple with cloud. As they hung, 
watching, darkness folded arms 
around the sun. 

“Storm.” Quickly Barrett skim- 
med toward the settlement. “I want 
everyone in the headsman’s dome, 
Second. We don’t have rods on the 
dorms yet.” 

When the scooter touched down 
wind fingered Barrett’s hair and a 
sulky darkness claimed half the sky. 
A few of the party stood slackly, 
cloud-darkness in their eyes. Others 
scurried. Juvenile Director Laer tod- 
dled a clutch of children past. 

Quickly the wind ceased to finger 
and began to whip. At a distance a 
bright slash of white briefly united 
cloud and soil. The sky grumbled and 
spat moisture into Barrett’s eyes. 

She maintained calm as she saw 



SWEET SISTER, GREEN BROTHER 



79 




the last of her people into the big 
dome, “No cause for alarm. The 
grounded rods will protect us from 
electrical discharges.” 

They secured dome doors and the 
sky turned black, offering dramatic 
contrast for the lightning that lit the 
horizon. A black-bellied beast, the 
storm strode toward them on flicker- 
ing legs. Isolated flurries of moisture 
spattered clearplas panes but were 
quickly sucked back into the air. 

Barrett turned. Her people had 
been briefed. They knew what it was 
that prowled outside, knew that al- 
though it was more severe than any 
storm they had ever experienced at 
the bottom of City America’s con- 
crete canyons, its flashing tongue 
could not reach them in the dome. 
But facts were of the mind, fear of 
the blood. Barrett paced through the 
gathering, offering assurance. Diallo’s 
Order of Confluence had claimed the 
largest storeroom. The mystics knelt 
in a bright-robed circle, bowed heads 
making them one. Their twenty 
voices, combined, created an airy 
whisper. 

A summons from the hallway: 
“Headsw’an! Disturbance in the 
second conference room.” 

Reaching the room, Barrett was 
greeted by a dozen frozen faces. Keef 
Zinc spun, narrow features fierce. 
“Head! Sparling sent my girl for 
water!” 

“I detailed Vella and Carlo Hegg 
to fetch more water before anyone 
saw the storm coming,” the little 
woman defended herself quickly. “I 



didn’t realize they were still out 
when we were ordered to take cover. 
I-” 

Barrett turned back to Zinc. 
“You’ve checked the entire dome for 
them, citizen?” 

“You think 1 wouldn’t know if my 
girl was inside? She’d be with Laer, 
wouldn’t she? Carlo, too.” 

Barrett glanced around. Diallo was 
beside her. “Get Laer.” 

Diallo bobbed away and returned 
with the burly young juvenile direc- 
tor. “I haven’t seen them since they 
went on water detail,” he contended. 
“But I briefed them on storm safety 
before I released them. And Carlo’s 
got sense for two.” 

“Then we can assume they’re 
safe,” Barrett assured Zinc. “They’ve 
probably taken cover under the trees. 
I’ll loft out to locate them as soon as 
the storm passes.” 

Z INC was not easily placated and 
now Barrett moved through her 
people, disturbed. True, Vella Zinc 
was fifteen, presumably mature 
enough to manage her own survival. 
And Carlo Hegg was an aggressively 
capable seventeen. But beyond the 
dome lightning probed and clawed. 
Wind bawled. If the rains that fol- 
lowed were extensive it might be 
hours before Barrett could loft in 
search. 

However no rains attended this 
storm. For another quarter-hour 
clearplas was alternately spattered 
and sucked dry. Then the storm 



80 



GALAXY 




stalked away across the horizon. The 
sun, a luminous Easter egg, reap- 
peared. 

When the main door opened Zinc 
was among the first to push outside. 
Barrett stepped after him. “Zinc. 
Which is your work crew?” 

Zinc’s narrow face petrified. 
“Work crew can suck a rock up its 
lube! I’m going out there.” 

“No. I can’t offer scooter passage. 
I’ll need the space if anyone is 
injured. And you haven’t been ex- 
cused from duty. But if you’ll name 
your crew leader I’ll have Vella re- 
port to you when I return her.” 

The urge to physical disputation 
was apparent in Zinc’s bunching 
arms. Barrett met his belligerent 
glare. Zinc deflated. “Dailey’s crew. 
Unloading the second capsule.” 
“Good. I’ll loft immediately.” But 
she did not move until Zinc rejoined 
his crew. Then she swung low across 
the land. As she neared the trees she 
noted that, despite the severity of 
I he storm, neither wind nor lightning 
had inflicted major damage. 

She had almost reached the trees 
when Vella Zinc and Carlo Hegg 
struggled out of a shallow hollow in 
the ground. Barrett swung and set- 
tled near. Neither juvenile seemed to 
comprehend her sudden appearance. 
Their faces were twin masks, stiff, 
stark. 

Barrett dismounted. “Hegg. Why 
didn’t you take shelter under the 
trees? Didn’t you see the storm 
approach?” 

Carlo nodded numbly, a square 



boy with a hard, aggressive face. 
“We— saw it.” 

“We-” 

“Yes?” Barrett directed full atten- 
tion to the girl. Vella was tall but 
slight, her thin face seldom animated 
by spirit. 

“We saw the storm when we 
started back with the pails,” Carlo 
interrupted, suddenly determined to 
speak. “We ran back to take shelter 
in the trees. It was closer than the 
settlement. Then we decided it 
would be better out here. So we— 
came out.” 

Barrett sensed evasion in his 
answer. She decided not to press the 
matter immediately. “Well, load the 
pails in the rear bay. I’ll lift you 
back.” 

“Sure.” Carlo shot an evaluating 
glance at the girl. “But I better warn 
you, Head— the water’s gone funny.” 
Quickly he lugged a pail near and 
unlidded it. 

Barrett glanced into the container, 
then pulled back involuntarily. A 
heavy odor emanated from the pail. 
“Let’s pour a sample into the lid.” 

They did so and examined it dis- 
tastefully. Water from the stream 
that had been clear and sweet earlier 
was gray now, clouded, repellent. 
“Anyone want to taste it?” Carlo 
suggested. 

“No. And we won’t draw water 
again until the stream has cleared. 
There’s evidently been heavy storm 
runoff.” 

“But it didn’t rain, did it?” Carlo 
demanded immediately. “And any- 



SWEET SISTER, GREEN BROTHER 



81 




way, we drew this water before the 
storm actually came. Because we 
didn’t see the storm till we came out 
of the trees and headed back.” 

“But the water was dirty when we 
went under the trees, Head,” Vella 
interposed. “We noticed the smell 
then. I didn’t want— and we noticed 
it was different under the trees then 
too. We-” 

Carlo’s gesture was rejective. “You 
noticed it was different. I didn’t see 
anything.” 

“1 didn’t see anything either. I 
noticed it was different.” She 
glanced from Carlo to Barrett. “It 
was.” 

Barrett nodded. “There are defi- 
nite atmospheric changes associated 
with the approach of storm, Vella. 
Possibly they were intensified in the 
enclosed area under the trees. And 
although we didn’t have rain here, 
obviously there was heavy fall some- 
where upstream. That accounts for 
the clouding of the water.” 

“That’s right.” Carlo’s tone was 
aggressive. 

Vella’s eyes fell. 

Barrett sighed. “Carlo, empty the 
pails before you load them. I want to 
have a look at the stream.” 

The trees were giants, at once tall, 
massive and dense with foliage. Their 
lower branches created a sheltering 
arch. Barrett stooped to enter. The 
air beneath the trees was heavy with 
the repellent odor she had detected 
in the water in Carlo’s pail. She 
peered up and around with a disturb- 
ing sense of having entered a new 



environment. Leaves moved on the 
lower branches of the trees. The 
sound of water was a throaty mur- 
mur. The air itself was still, haunting- 
ly so, as if there were some unper- 
ceived presence here. 

Straightening, Barrett approached 
the streambed. Six hours ago the 
water had flowed low in the channel. 
Now it was high. Barrett stooped and 
filled her cupped palm. She flicked 
the water away immediately, dis- 
tastefully. 

Storm runoff. She stood and 
glanced around, uneasy victim of the 
sensation that tongues spoke under 
these trees, tongues whose language 
she could not comprehend. The still 
air was not disturbed by their mur- 
murous appeal. But she was. Briskly 
she removed herself from the 
haunted stillness. 

Vella and Carlo waited beside the 
scooter. They lofted back in silence. 

Time passed its slow hand 
across the face of Narr. From 
the high kingdom Fliiyr di- 
rected down assassins, wind 
and storm. But low-growing 
vegetation shielded Narr from 
assault. Dense-limbed trees pro- 
tected her running waters. 
Brother and sister, trees and 
water faced the aggressor, flow- 
ing, protecting, always resum- 
ing their murmurous refrain 
when crisis passed. 

Then brother and sister be- 
came aware of a new factor. It 
was one neither could compre- 



82 



GALAXY 




hend. It was not of Narr. Nor 
was it of Fliiyr. It intruded 
upon their age-old communion, 
adding a disruptive refrain of 
its own. 

But to understand it in the 
singular was misleading. It was 
not singular. Even when the 
voice it employed was only 
one, that voice carried dispa- 
rate messages. Fight, the mes- 
sages said. Yield, Seek, Win. 
Die. Seize. Give. Be. Some- 
times the voice denied the 
truth-reality of their being. At 
other times it tried, however 
tentatively, to merge its voice 
with theirs. 

It was a phenomenon diffi- 
cult to assimilate, particularly 
when consciousness was amor- 
phous and channeled largely 



into the murmurous refrain of 
being and surviving. 

Flow, sister-protect, 
brother . 

Then the sun climbed up 
Fliiyr’s pale shoulder again and 
there came an incursion that 
was many voices at once. Like 
a wedge, it pushed beneath the 
trees. It was chaos. 

Fortunately it did not re- 
main chaos. Instead the new 
incursion found the rhythm 
and flow of being and joined 
its multiple voices to the mur- 
murous refrain. The invading 
voices became one, first with 
one another, then with brother 
and sister. The combined voice 
made itself welcome, a com- 
forting part of the reassurance 
that passed from trees to

waters and back again. It made 
itself a part of time, the time 
that stretched beneath the 
trees, the time that flowed in 
the waters. 

But while brother and sister 
accepted and tried to under- 
stand, old Fliiyr stalked si- 
lently and pounced. Distracted, 
the trees’ sentinel branches 
failed to give alert until sud- 
denly bitter-dry winds chewed 
their tender leaves. 

Storm! The trees shrieked 
and a spike of fear gained 
physical being. Storm comes! 
Capillaries squeezed. Fluid was 
expressed and boiled through 
the soil, seeking safety. 

I receive ! sweet sister bab- 
bled, swelling, darkening. 
Shield me, brother! I flow with 
your life ’s blood . 

It was as if the agents of 
Fliiyr knew brother and sister 
were caught unaware. The 
winds were fierce. Bright-white 
fingers reached down, ripping 
and slashing. But the trees had 
discharged their fluid. Their 
flesh was dense and fibrous. 
Those few limbs that took fire 
quickly sputtered out. When 
finally storm passed, brother 
and sister bore no mortal 
ravage. There were only fallen 
branches, a single deep slash 
wound, and the tailings of fear. 

And the incursion that had 
distracted them was gone. 
There was no alien voice, single 



or multiple. Gratefully green 
brother sucked his life’s blood 
back. Sweet sister retired deep 
into her channel, clearing. 
Green brother renewed the re- 
frain: Flow, sweet sister. Bring 
me the moisture I crave . 

I flow, green brother. 

No other voice joined theirs. 
They were content to be alone. 

II 

B ARRETT stood at her window 
at dusk. The settlement was de- 
veloping satisfactorily. All twelve 
dorms were occupied. Auxiliary 
sheds and shelters were in place. The 
fields were seeded. New confidence 
lit almost every face. 

But when Cham Diallo spoke from 
the doorway Barrett’s face hardened. 
“Take a seat, Second.” 

The mystic entered and sat. Before 
Barrett could initiate discussion her 
doorway was occupied again. Despite 
disparity of age, physique and fea- 
ture, Keef Zinc and Carlo Hegg were 
one in attitude— combative. 

Barrett’s frown deepened. “Yes?” 
“We want Vella pulled off water 
detail,” Zinc informed her, his nar- 
row face knotted. 

Barrett did not feign receptivity. 
“I see. Have you discussed the matter 
with Sparling?” 

“I have,” Carlo asserted. “I re- 
ported Vella to Sparling two weeks 
ago for not doing her share on water 
detail.” 

Barrett’s frown deepened. “Then 



GALAXY 




I’m sure Sparling explained that a 
younger, less muscular individual’s 
quota-” 

“The only reason Vella’s meeting 
tier quota at all is because I’m doing 
my work and hers,” Carlo asserted, 
his square cheeks turning to block. 
“The first day we went out, she 
worked. Until the storm. The water 
spooked her. After that I was the 
only one to go under the trees. She 
waited outside until I came back 
with the pails. I got tired of that. I 
told her she had to go to the stream, 
too. Never mind her—” He glared 
belligerently. “Never mind. Well, 
now she goes in. And she sits around 
under the trees while I fill the pails 
and haul them out. She wouldn’t 
even carry her quota back to the 
settlement if I didn’t make her.” 
“Excuse me, Headsw’an,” Diallo 
said. “I received Sparling’s report 
yesterday. It is in the day file.” 

“Get it then.” When he returned 
Barrett studied the document. Carlo 
had spoken to Sparling two weeks 
ago. Sparling had discussed the mat- 
ter with Vella twice. She had queried 
Carlo yesterday and he had refused 
to withdraw his complaint. Barrett 
frowned. “Well, Carlo, it appears the 
next step is to call a conference of—” 
“It appears the next step is to take 
Vella off water detail,” Carlo inter- 
rupted harshly. “You call people 
together, you talk for two weeks 
more, you— I’m tired of doing Vella’s 
work while she sits out there getting 
queer about the trees.” 

Barrett glanced at him sharply. 



“Queer? Can you clarify that?” 

Carlo’s hard young face flushed. 
Apparently he had said more than he 
had intended. 

“I’ll clarify it,” Keef Zinc said. 
“These shavepates have been hanging 
around under the trees after work 
hours.” He glared at Diallo. “I know 
what they’re trying to do. They’re 
trying to get my kid into the Order. 
They’re-” 

Barrett’s voice sharpened. 
“Second! Has there been an attempt 
on the part of the Order to prosely- 
tize any young person?” 

Diallo’s impassive features de- 
flected the accusation harmlessly. 
“The Order has respected the 
pledge.” 

Barrett nodded. “I’m sure you 
realize, Citizen Zinc, that before we 
left City America, both organized re- 
ligious groups pledged not to attempt 
to convert any minor, committed or 
uncommitted.” 

“And you think the shavepates 
can’t snake around that? My kid was 
there this morning when they had 
their feast. Are you going to tell me 
they didn’t offer her food? Right off 
their spread?” 

“But how can any member of the 
community ‘offer’ food to any other 
member?” Diallo asked. “Our feast 
was drawn from communal stores. 
Any item belonged equally to each 
member of the community.” 

“She watched their ceremonies, 
too,” Carlo chimed in. “They were 
under the trees when we went on 
detail. I went downstream to draw

water, but Vella stayed. The whole 
time. I know because when the water 
changed, I ran back to—” 

Barrett cut short hostilities. 
“Carlo, Citizen Zinc— I will speak to 
Sparling and Laer tomorrow. They 
will meet with Vella and report back 
to me. If we don’t have rain soon, 
we’ll necessarily expand the water 
detail to support irrigation. The pres- 
ence of adults should prod Vella to 
take her leisure at a more appropriate 
time.” 

Z INC and Carlo departed unsatis- 
fied. Barrett turned to Diatlo. 
“Now, Second, I have reports that 
your group left the shelter of the 
trees during this morning’s storm and 
exposed themselves on open 
ground.” More specifically, her infor- 
mants had stated that the robed 
mystics had burst from the trees in 
stark fear, most promptly throwing 
themselves flat, but two running all 
the way back to settlement bounds. 
“Your group certainly had the right 
to convene and to hold religious 
observances on the day selected for 
them. But once you went beyond 
settlement bounds it was your re- 
sponsibility to enforce storm safety 
rules, Diallo.” 

Diallo’s eyes flickered away. “Yet 
there is no authority in confluence, 
Headsw’an. Can a single expression 
of the Unity wield authority over 
those who are already himself?” 

“Yes. Very easily if he is also 
second in command of this party. 
There wasn’t one member of our 



community who didn’t experience 
panic this morning. If we allow our 
people to stampede in the face of 
fear we may never survive to meet 
evaluation, Diallo.” Perhaps she exag- 
gerated. Perhaps not. She had studied 
planet party histories. Many groups 
had survived catastrophes. Others 
had shattered at minor blows— and 
perished. 

Diallo bowed his head. “This 
morning— when the water changed I 
could control no one. I could not 
even control myself. The fear we 
experienced negated rationality.” 
Barrett’s brows arched. The admis- 
sion surprised her. “Then I suggest 
the Order conduct future religious 
ceremonies within the bounds of the 
settlement, where you can reach shel- 
ter immediately.” 

Diallo’s eyes flickered up again, 
briefly dark with expression. “No. 
The trees best serve our purposes. 
And today, before the storm, we 
formally consecrated our temple of 
the waters, from which we will con- 
duct ourselves into the spiritual flow 
of this world.” 

“That may be. But community 
survival takes first priority. If there 
are further lapses I will restrict the 
Order. Citizen Zinc’s outburst sug- 
gests another matter. In the future I 
want no underage individual to ob- 
serve the Order’s services.” 

Diallo withdrew, promising. 

AND Barrett was alone again— and 
x \ restless. She approached the 
window. Poled lamps created d.is- 



86 



GALAXY 




tinctly edged pools of light along the 
settlement’s main footpaths. As she 
watched, two bright-robed mystics 
rustled from a dorm and disappeared 
into darkness. The starfield overhead 
was vivid and close. So close. 

And Earth so far. Barrett did not 
yearn for today’s Earth. But upon 
occasion she longed for the Earth 
that had existed before the skies had 
closed with photochemical pall, be- 
fore the hills had been leveled and 
the meadows paved, before water 
had ceased to run in boulder-studded 
streams, tumbling clear and cold to 
the sea. 

Water. She left the window. This 
morning the Order had fled when the 
waters darkened and rose. According 
to Carlo, Vella Zinc had been reluc- 
tant to step under the trees again 
after seeing the stream in storm 
stage. And Barrett remembered 
clearly the revulsion the stenchy gray 
waters had raised in her. 

Everyone knew the stream exhib- 
ited storm change. But few realized 
the degree of that change. Absently 
Barrett flipped through the weather 
diary. She was troubled by the fre- 
quency with which the storm code 
recurred, particularly during the last 
two weeks. She drew down the ex- 
ploration party’s microreport and 
loaded it. 

It told her little. The survey team 
had observed electrical storms. No- 
thing specific was said of their fre- 
quency or seasonality. Their inten- 
sity was measured as greater than 
that experienced on Earth. But the 



fact that the planet had been recom- 
mended for settlement suggested the 
storms hadn’t been considered a 
major negative factor. 

Barrett flicked off the viewer. 
EarthAuthority hadn’t resources in 
ships or trained personnel to conduct 
more than superficial study of any 
prospective planet. There were many 
hundreds potentially compatible to 
human life. Their air was breathable. 
Water was available. Growing condi- 
tions roughly suitable for human 
crops prevailed. 

On the other side of the equation 
were hundreds of thousands of hu- 
mans desperately eager to escape 
City America and its European and 
Asian equivalents. Confronted with a 
shortage of certain resources, a sur- 
plus of others, EarthAuthority em- 
ployed volunteer settlers to deter- 
mine the ultimate habitability of 
selected worlds. Colonists were 
shipped and landed. If they survived 
and made the assigned world yield 
within five years, that world was 
habitable. If they died— or if a world 
refused to support them— the world 
was not habitable. 

And the loss of human lives, the 
devastation of human hopes, did not 
enter the equation. 

Barrett framed herself again in the 
window, inner eye intent upon 
planet features shrouded now by 
darkness: green fields, stalwart trees, 
clear waters, rosy sun. Certainly this 
world gave every outward sign of 
being habitable. 

Yet there had been five severe 



SWEET SISTER, GREEN BROTHER 



87 




electrical storms in their first two 
weeks, seven in the last two. Another 
fact, equally disturbing, was that 
none of those storms had been 
accompanied locally by measurable 
precipitation. Native vegetation re- 
mained green, its thick foliage shel- 
tering soil that was moist and loose. 
But settlement fields, exposed to the 
air, were dry. 

If no rain fell during the next 
week or so, irrigation would become 
necessary. But if the storms became 
much more frequent the settlers 
could be forced to use water that was 
redolent of storm runoff, both in 
the fields and in the settlement. 
Barrett returned to her chart counter 
and reactivated the viewer. She 
flicked quickly through available pla- 
netary data, finding nothing new. 
Perhaps they had arrived at storm 
season. Perhaps every season was 
equally stormy. Or perhaps storm 
season was yet to come. There was 
only one way to learn. 

That was to endure. 

She frowned. Although they were 
equipped with nothing as sophisti- 
cated as water pumps or piping, 
capsule three was convertible to a 
water tank. Perhaps she should assign 
personnel to haul emergency water 
stores. 

That tentative decision reached, 
Barrett was still not satisfied. The 
relation between electric storm and 
stream disturbed her. Why, if it 
rained hard enough upstream to 
cause marked clouding, did it never 
rain here? 



She found no satisfactory answer 
in sleep. 

She lofted early the next morning, 
when the sun was an egg hatching on 
a purple-gray horizon. The main 
dome glowed in the rosy rays. Be- 
yond, in the settlement fields, the 
first crops tentatively greened the 
dry soil. The line of trees curved 
gently, embracing the land, a long 
unbroken band that crossed the hori- 
zon in either direction. 

Barrett left the scooter near the 
trees. Beneath arching limbs, morn- 
ing was as old as time. Air was moist. 
The stream spoke with a gentle 
tongue. Barrett approached the bank. 
The water was clear today, low in its 
channel. How long, she wondered, 
had it required to clear after yester- 
day’s storm? 

She paced the stream bank 
thoughtfully, finding brief respite 
from her concerns. Her taut shoul- 
ders relaxed. Her effectiveness might 
actually be enhanced, she reflected, 
if she granted herself a free day, if 
she brought lunch and sleeping pad 
to the streamside and let herself 
become attuned to this environment, 
serene and calm. 

She dismissed the prospect impa- 
tiently. Briskly she glanced around, 
seeking sign of the Order’s waterside 
temple. But possibly Diallo had not 
referred to a specific plot of soil. 

She left the trees and took to the 
morning sky. The settlers were not 
completely helpless, she realized. 
They had been issued a store of basic 
chemicals. It might be possible to 



88 



GALAXY 




find a compound that would clear or 
deodorize storm water. Certainly no 
former City American would balk at 
drinking water that tasted of chemi- 
cal. 

They were not helpless. But when 
Barrett set down at field’s edge and 
saw a storm gathering on the horizon 
again, a finger of fear touched her, 
however lightly, however briefly. 

D IALLQ was charting supply de- 
pletions when word came across 
the lawn. 

“Storm!” 

Jumping to the window, he saw 
the warning darkness and fear struck 
him, a slashing blade. But his course 
of action was predecided. Diallo 
seized the supply log and returned it 
to his cubicle. From a drawer he 
drew a length of strong cord. Tying it 
around his waist, he pattered from 
the dome. 

Settlers already converged on shel- 
ter. Diallo circumvented them, ran 
down the pathway and emerged at 
the edge of the settlement. Wind 
picked at his worksuit and slapped 
his shaven foreskull. As he loped 
across open ground toward the trees 
he glanced up. Storm had already 
swallowed the sun. Now it consumed 
the sky. Somewhere lightning licked 
air hungrily. The sharp crack of 
thunder announced its appetite. 

Diallo ran. By the time he reached 
the trees their upper branches whip- 
ped. Darkness swelled about him like 
some overwhelming force. 

In the broad archway under the 



trees fear was a live thing. It walked, 
it cried. Its voice pierced the mind 
and seared the spinal cord, rendering 
the feet useless, the legs numb. Yes- 
terday it had taken Diallo unpre- 
pared. Today he was ready for it. 

He reached stream’s edge and 
snapped the cord from his waist. 
Throwing himself down— the waters 
were high, the waters were dark: 
protect me, green brother— he, se- 
cured his ankles with a series of 
complex knots. He could never re- 
lease them without concentrated ef- 
fort. At this moment, his mind pos- 
sessed, his fingers numb, he could 
barely tie them. 

That done, he crawled back until 
he encountered tree. He pressed his 
spinal column against its stout trunk, 
braced his head, flung his arms back 
to grasp bark with frantic fingertips. 

Fear had no words, only voice, 
and that voice was piercing agony. 
Diallo’s fingers dug into the bark. His 
body convulsed briefly. Then he sur- 
rendered himself. His glassy eyes 
fixed on nothing. 

Storm bellowed. Wind snarled and 
tore. Then gradually, dimly, Diallo 
became aware that the storm had 
walked away. Fear faded. The dark 
waters seemed not so much to writhe 
as to run again. 

Diallo hunched forward weakly. 
He sucked blood from lacerated 
fingertips. Painfully he loosened the 
cord from his ankles, stood and 
groped toward daylight. In the dis- 
tance the storm retreated. And his 
suspicion was confirmed. The fear he 



SWEET SISTER, GREEN BROTHER 



89 




had felt under the trees yesterday 
had not been his own at all. It had 
been external— not a cry he uttered 
but one he heard. 

He stared back at the trees. He was 
not ready to accept what struck him 
as obvious. Humans and other ani- 
mals experienced fear. But the trees? 

Diallo trudged back toward the 
settlement. Reaching the dome, he 
took his shredded fingertips to the 
first-aid closet. They were physical 
proof of what he had experienced. 
No illusions had convulsed his body 
or shredded his flesh on the bark of a 
tree. Nor had the fear been hallucina- 
tory. The entire Order had experi- 
enced it yesterday. Evidently Vella 
Zinc had experienced it, too. 

In his cubicle Diallo hunched on 
his stool, unable to resume work. 
Afternoon became night. Diallo 
stood at the window and stared at 
the stars. He was of the universe, the 
universe of him. Today he was sen- 
tient and self-willed. He commanded 
intelligence and mobility. Tomorrow 
perhaps he would be without those 
gifts. He would be soil, he would be 
dust. Or he would be microbe, lamb, 
cabbage, tree. 

Head bowed, he sat again. He was 
already tree. He and tree shared the 
basic unity of all matter and energy. 
He was already water, rock, star, sun. 

It gave him no comfort. Once— a 
boy— he had viewed the universe 
from another perspective. The sun at 
the top of the canyon had been a 
wondrous separate world inviting ex- 
ploration. The water that trickled 



from the ration faucet had been a 
miraculous substance, each drop a 
separate cloudy mystery. His own 
fingernail parings had held urgent 
questions to be answered. 

Now he had to revive dormant 
boyhood curiosity. It still lived some- 
where in him. It had to. 

Barrett was in her office. When 
Diallo entered he was aware of her 
speculative glance at his injured 
fingers and bruised head. 
“Headsw’an, I would like to check 
out microviewer and texts.” 

Barrett did not answer immedi- 
ately. “Second, I understand you left 
the settlement this afternoon when 
storm warnings were out.” 

“I took shelter in the trees,” he 
admitted. “It was necessary.” 

Again she did not respond immedi- 
ately. “And this time you were able 
to maintain control?” 

“I— was,” he affirmed, not sure the 
statement was true. 

Barrett elected not to pursue the 
matter. She reached across her chart 
counter and handed him the micro- 
viewer. “Help yourself from the li- 
brary. Second. It’s all there.” 

“Thank you.” Later, perhaps, he 
would discuss with her what he had 
learned today. Later, if he could find 
authoritative support for the validity 
of his experience. 

And if he could not? 

Diallo returned to his cubicle with 
his selection of microtexts. 

Two hours later he flicked off the 
viewer and cradled his eyes in his 
hands, discouraged. Finally he raised 



90

his head and reactivated the viewer. 
Lips moving, he continued to read. 

Ill 

T HREE days later Nellis appeared 
at Barrett’s door, carrybin in 
hand. “Nell— let’s see what you 
have.” 

He removed sample jars silently 
from the carrier. “I followed instruc- 
tions, Head— as well as I could.” 
Barrett glanced at him sharply. 
“You took samples each half-hour 
until signs of clouding, then each 
quarter hour until the water had 
cleared?” Today’s storm— the settle- 
ment had enjoyed two days’ res- 
pite-had descended in early after- 
noon. It was near supper now. 

“As far as I could, I did.” His tone 
was trenchant. The muscles in his 
forearms were knotting. 

Barrett examined the numbered 
bottles and frowned. The morning 
samples were clear. Pronounced 
clouding appeared shortly after 
noon. But the jars that should have 
contained the five subsequent sam- 
ples were empty, although Nellis had 
numbered them and put down the 
appropriate collection times. The 
sixth jar— drawn, she calculated, 
shortly after the storm passed— con- 
tained dark water. Thereafter sam- 
ples were drawn at the requested 
intervals again. They showed a grad- 
ual clearing over a three-hour period. 

Barrett glanced up, disturbed. A 
loner, Nellis exhibited stubborn pride 
of endurance that made him one of 

SWEET SISTER GREEN BROTHER 



her most reliable workers. Today 
pride obviously had not driven him 
to collect water samples during the 
height of storm. “Can you tell me 
why you didn’t conduct the test as 
requested, Nell?” 

“I did what you told me— as far as 
I could,” Nellis insisted stubbornly. 
His fists clenched. “That’s all, 
Headsw’an.” 

Barrett sighed. “Ail right, Nell. 
Drop these by Klass’s shed. It’s his 
turn now.” 

Nellis sighed with relief. He with- 
drew. 

Barrett slumped on her stool. So 
storm water appeared at least half an 
hour before storm reached the im- 
mediate area and required three 
hours to clear. Only if storm fre- 
quency stepped up beyond twice 
daily would there be a definite water 
problem. But could she afford to 
gamble that that would not happen? 

She could not. Capsule three had 
been converted for water storage 
yesterday. Tomorrow she must sche- 
dule a crew to fill it. 

Decision reached, she remained 
uneasy. She ate, then returned to the 
dome. Light showed beneath Diallo’s 
door. Barrett knocked on impulse. 

T HE mystic’s face seemed older, 
drawn. His cubicle was austerely 
ordered except for the work counter. 
There the microviewer sat in a welter 
of microtext capsules. 

“Research?” Barrett asked. 

Diallo’s slight shoulders tensed. 
“Yes. There are several matters of 

91 




biological science that I— I have felt 
compelled to study.” 

“You haven’t by chance touched 
on meteorology?” she asked. 

“I— no.” 

“Well, I’m puzzled— and dis- 
turbed— by our storms, Second. I was 
led to believe they^ould be accom- 
panied by rain. Not by any specific 
rain figures quoted in the explor- 
ation crew’s report— they give 
none— but on the general principle 
that electrical storms are accom- 
panied by precipitation. Now appa- 
rently they are, somewhere up- 
stream. But not on our land. And our 
crops weren’t bred for drought.” 

“Yet native vegetation shows no 
sign of parching,” he pointed out 
promptly. 

That was true. “Perhaps it’s 
adapted to a lower level of mois- 
ture.” She frowned. “But it’s not 
functioning at a lower level, Second. 
I examined the uncultivated area 
near our fields this morning. The 
ground there is still quite moist, even 
though there has been no rain in the 
month-plus since landfall. It’s only 
our land that is dry.” 

He darted a glance at the micro- 
viewer. “Plant roots hold moisture,” 
he reminded her quickly. “And fo- 
liage shields the soil from heat and 
wind. So stripped land dries and 
erodes while covered land is pro- 
tected.” 

“Ag unit one: erosion,” she con- 
curred. “But that same foliage should 
be passing soil moisture out through 
its leaves continuously, Diallo. Tran- 



spiration: ag unit four.” She 

frowned, Diallo, after all, had taken 
ag only through unit two, then had 
specialized in stores management. 
“But that fact aside, tell me how the 
soil got to be moist in the first place 
if the storms aren’t accompanied by 
rain here? And why aren’t they? And 
if it doesn’t rain upstream either, 
why do we have runoff in the stream 
preceding, during and following 
every storm?” 

“It—” Diallo’s eyes flickered away, 
troubled. “I had not thought of that 
aspect of matters. “I—” Turning, he 
selected a microtext and dropped it 
into the viewer. “Headsw’an, did you 
know that plants experience emo- 
tion?” 

Barrett was totally unprepared for 
the switch of topic. “Plants? Like 
our crops?” 

“I was referring to the trees. The 
texts tell me plant emotion was first 
demonstrated in Earth laboratories 
over a century and a half ago. Certain 
individuals were shown to promote 
plant growth just through some qua- 
lity of their presence. And human 
experimenters were also able to com- 
municate threat to laboratory plants 
and measure fright-reaction. The ex- 
periments are reported here.” 

Baffled, Barrett studied the indi- 
cated passages. She nodded slowly. 
“I suppose I’ve heard about the 
effect. But of course those experi- 
ments were done with Earth -variety 
garden plants. Not with anything 
resembling the trees down by the 
stream.” 



92 



GALAXY 




“But do you not think that the 
principle could be applicable to the 
trees?” Diallo insisted. ‘'And that 
they could experience fear?” 

“I suppose they could,” she ad- 
mitted. “But-” 

“Of storm?” 

“Well-yes.” 

Suddenly the mystic’s forehead 
was beaded with sweat from brow to 
braid. “And do you not think it 
possible for the communication of 
emotion to occur in the opposite 
direction too? For the trees to com- 
municate their fear of storm to hu- 
mans who happen to be near?” 

It took Barrett some moments to 
grasp what he proposed. “You 
think—” Despite the incredibility of 
the suggestion, her mind was already 
marshaling support data: Vella’s and 
Carlo’s odd behavior after the first 
storm; Carlo’s report of Vella’s subse- 
quent attitude: Diallo’s admission 
that the entire Order had fled the 
trees during the storm; the unfilled 
sample jars Nellis had turned in. 
“Second, you stayed under the trees 
throughout Wednesday’s storm.” 

The mystic examined bandaged 
fingertips. “Only by the device of 
securing my ankles and clinging to a 
tree trunk. There was intense fear 
under the trees throughout the 
storm. But it was not mine, Head. It 
came from without. It came from the 
trees. There was no other possible 
source.” 

Barrett nodded reluctantly. “Yes. 
There have been other incidents, 
Second.” Quickly she reviewed them. 



Diallo’s head bobbed eagerly. 
“And the girl’s present behavior- 
when the trees are at peace, 
Headsw’an, they communicate that 
too. I have felt it. Any sensitive 
person would, I think, if only half- 
consciously. That, I suppose, is why 
the Order selected the waterside for 
consecration. There is serenity there. 
A feeling of timelessness.” 

“I felt relaxed there myself.” Bar- 
rett smiled wryly. “I managed to 
overcome it.” 

“But apparently the girl does not 
care to.” 

Barrett nodded thoughtfully. Was 
it so incredible? If, as the texts 
clearly indicated, a plant could react 
to a human’s emotional state, why 
not a human to a plant’s? “Diallo, 
have you discussed this with any- 
one?” 

He was emphatic. “No one.” 

“Good. I want to question Laer. 
I’ve asked him to draw the Zinc girl 
out. He may be able to confirm this 
hypothesis.” 

Diallo agreed with patent relief. 

Normally Barrett would not have 
summoned Laer until morning. 

However the occasion was not 
normal. 

unr INC? I think we’re growing 

M- J our first nut case,” the burly 
juvenile director informed Barrett an 
hour later. “She’s in communication 
with the trees and the water. She’s 
vague on the exact content of the 
interchange, but the general trend is 
that they care about her— care a lot.” 



SWEET SISTER, GREEN BROTHER 



93 




Sparl proposes we pull her off 
water detail. Better, we’d both like 
to amputate her from Carlo and her 
father, give her a chance to grow.” 
He shrugged loosely. “How, I don’t 
know. She shouldn’t even be here— 
she’s not pioneer material.” 

Barrett nodded agreement. But 
there was little point in decrying the 
inadequate screening process now. 
Laer’s testimony confirmed Diallo’s 
hypothesis— and there were decisions 
to be made. She snapped her jotter 
against her palm. “Tomorrow I plan 
to schedule an adult crew to fetch 
water for emergency stores. We’ll 
reassign Carlo to field duty then, 
Laer, and Vella can take settlement 
work. And for the time being I want 
you to restrict Vella from the trees 
entirely. But make it clear that it 
isn’t a punitive restriction. We have 
reason.” Reason she was reluctant to 
broach now. 

Laer’s beard parted in a grin. 
“Good enough for me.” He departed 
with cheer. 

Bleakly Barrett wished she could 
share that cheer. Storms that weren’t 
accompanied by rainfall, ground that 
remained moist in the absence of 
precipitation, trees that communi- 
cated fear— Barrett felt suddenly 
plunged into a sea of anomaly. The 
fact that she had been forewarned 
that such anomalies might exist 
yielded scant comfort. 

She approached the window. Viv- 
idly she remembered today’s storm. 
Could she in good conscience dis- 
patch a water crew tomorrow with- 



out warning them that in case of 
storm the trees would communicate 
disorganizing fear to at least the 
more susceptible of them? 

She could not. 

Neither could she imagine now 
how she was going to present that 
warning when morning came. And 
the matters of rainfall, storm runoff 
and soil moisture unresolved, too . 

D IALLO hung above the land, 
troubled. He had followed the 
line of trees upstream for three days, 
seeking rain. Now another storm 
moved down upon them, straddling 
the band of trees. Tensely he took 
the scooter to the surface, rolled it 
beneath the trees and secured it. The 
stench of fear was already thick in 
the shadows. Diallo ran from the 
trees and threw himself to the 
ground. 

As he huddled there, storm began 
to lick and taste at the land on either 
side of him. Diallo could feel its hot 
breath on his shaven skull. He shud- 
dered. Last night, restless, he had 
seen storm in dream. It had walked 
his private night, green-eyed, supple, 
and he had wakened with the truth 
suddenly clear in his mind— storm 
was a panther. And its prey? The 
trees. Storm stalked the trees merci- 
lessly across the land, baring light- 
ning fangs, howling from its black 
throat. 

Diallo quivered as his head was 
briefly spattered with moisture and 
licked dry. Lightning and wind— 
claws of the beast. How was he to 



94 



GALAXY 




tell Barrett that what they con- 
fronted here was a skyborne preda- 
tor? 

Facts: he had followed the line of 
trees upstream for three days with- 
out once encountering a break in 
their solid wall; nor had he encoun- 
tered rain, although he had met 
storm frequently and had always 
found the stream swollen and dark at 
those times; and never once had he 
seen storm focused anywhere but 
upon the line of trees. 

These were facts. Barrett was a 
person of facts. But Diallo’s facts 
were scanty and did not add up to 
his conclusion. His conclusion had 
come from other sources, by night. 

Yet his conclusion was valid. The 
more rational parts of his mind re- 
jected it, but as an intuitional person 
he not only accepted its truth but 
embraced it. Storm was a preying 
beast. The trees cried with fear at its 
coming. 

Diallo cringed against the soil until 
the winds swept away. Then he rose, 
darted to the trees and released the 
hoverscooter. Lofting, he followed 
the winds downstream. He had failed 
in his mission to find rain. He did not 
believe now that there was rain, not 
anywhere on this world. There was 
only stream and trees, lightning and 
wind, prey and predator. 

How did the fact that there were 
now humans, too, affect the equa- 
tion? Diallo didn’t know. But his 
unease was great, his heart troubled, 
as he headed back toward the settle- 
ment. 



TORM! Her mind shrieked and 
Vella woke rooted in fear. Wind 
clawed her branches, lightning stung 
her hair. Protect me, shield me, save 
me! her mind babbled. Storm! Elec- 
trified, Vella tried to spring up from 
the dirt. But her legs would not have 
her. Instead her lips parted and her 
own voice rent the air. 

Save me! I flow into your arms. 
Carry me, protect me, fire reaches 
down, wind tatters and tears! Shield 
me, protect me, flow, protect, carry, 
shield . 

Then Vella gained her knees, 
pounding ears with palms. No, no! 
She hadn’t meant to lose herself in 
the dark. She hadn’t meant to sleep 
the night under the trees. She hadn’t 
meant anyone to ever know she had 
slipped away after lights out. She 
hadn’t meant . 

Save me! Vella screamed again, a 
cry torn from her to join the other 
cries, to join the piercing fear, the 
possessing fear, the driving fear. 

And it drove her. Stumbling to her 
feet, she plunged through the trees. / 
flow into your arms. Cherish me, 
carry me, save me! She ran hard 
against a tree and her nose smashed 
and ran down her face. Her eyes were 
blind, her mind a bubbling geyser of 
fear. Then her feet found purchase 
on nothing and she flowed. There 
were arms wet and cold. They closed 
around her. She tried to shriek again 
but water bubbled in her mouth. It 
was thick, it was terrible, it was 
black. 

It was death.

B ARRETT was at her chart 
counter when the cry came 
across the lawn. She hurried through 
the dome. Search parties had been 
combing the trees and adjoining 
fields since noon yesterday for the 
missing girl. When Barrett reached 
the lawn, however, the cry resolved 
into, “Hover’s coming!” Barrett 
glanced up and Second Diallo rode 
the sky, an insect against a backdrop 
of afternoon violet. His bright robe 
fluttered. Barrett hurried across the 
lawn. 

The craft touched ground and 
hands rushed to moor it. Diallo 
scrambled down uncoordinatedly. 
Catching uncertain balance, he 
glanced behind him, fear on his face. 
“Head— storm upstream. Ten min- 
utes, fifteen.” 

Barrett peered down the line of 
trees. Barely perceptible darkness 
touched the sky. “L’Abbott, I want 
the searchers clear of the trees before 
the storm arrives,” she instructed 
quickly. 

Nodding, L’Abbott loped away. 
Barrett turned back to Diallo. He 
was breathing shallowly, his features 
gaunt, his eyes too bright. “Come to 
my office, Second.” 

From behind her closed door, they 
could hear the community taking 
storm haven. Barrett gestured Diallo 
to a seat. She spoke sharply to 
penetrate his obvious agitation. 
“Have you eaten?” 

“I’ve eaten. I’ve—” 

“Then report, Second. Did you 
find rain?” Her hand touched Klass’s 



final report. She knew, grimly, what 
Diallo’s answer had to be. There was 
no other possibility. 

His eyes flickered past her, then 
returned and settled. He tongued his 
lips. “No. There is no rain, Head. 
Nowhere. It’s all in the sky— all the 
excess water vapor. The storm will 
never release it.” 

Barrett rocked back, brows arch- 
ing. The information was as she had 
anticipated. The delivery was not. 
“Well, I’ve had almost a week now to 
gather and consider new informa- 
tion,” she said slowly. “And it does 
appear that we’re dealing with the 
uncomfortable reality of an aberrant 
moisture distribution system.” She 
glanced down at the Klass data on 
Nellis’s storm-water samples. “Evi- 
dently what we’re finding in the 
stream isn’t runoff at all. I don’t see 
how it could be. And Klass and I 
arranged some rather primitive exper- 
iments that demonstrated that local 
vegetation doesn’t return moisture to 
the air by transpiration. So apparent- 
ly moisture is distributed through 
some underground network we 
haven’t had time to study yet. Those 
facts, coupled with the fact that we 
haven’t observed rain—” 

“Because a panther doesn’t shed 
his fangs,” Diallo hissed, leaning for- 
ward. “That is why the trees are 
afraid, Head— panthers.” He tried to 
impress his point with glittery-bright 
eyes. “I am not irrational, Head. I’ve 
found the truth. The storms are 
predators. They stalk the trees. They 
use what water vapor they have to 



96 



GALAXY 




create lightning. They— why do they 
always move along the trees, if they 
aren’t predatory? Why haven’t we 
seen a storm focused anywhere else, 
Head?” 

Barrett frowned. The repetitious 
path of storm travel was another 
loose fact that troubled her. “There 
may be a meteorological explanation, 
Diallo,” she offered slowly. “The 
landscape is flat and unbroken ex- 
cept for the bands of trees, ours and 
the others that lace the temperate 
zones. I haven’t had opportunity yet 
to really study the meteorological 
texts, but—” 

Diallo shook his head emphati- 
cally. “No. Meteorological conditions 
may make it possible for the preda- 
tor to stalk. But he would not stalk if 
he were not a predator.” 

“Second—” Barrett murmured, 
buying time. “Second, if the storms 
are predators, they don’t seem to be 
particularly effective ones, do they? 
On Earth wind often uprooted large 
trees. Lightning sometimes set fires 
that destroyed whole forests. But 
here, where we’ve already seen al- 
most two dozen severe storms, we’ve 
seen almost no actual damage. A few 
limbs broken, a few leaves scat- 
tered-” 

“A house cat, Head. A house cat 
could never fell a deer,” Diallo coun- 
tered vehemently. “But a house cat is 
a predator just the same. It is a 
matter of disproportion of size and 
strength. To us the storm seems 
severe. To the trees, who are 
strong—” 



“Yet you’re the one who first 
pointed out that the trees fear storm. 
Intensely.” 

Diallo’s eyes were briefly frozen, 
disconcerted. His lips moved. 

“No, I appreciate the analogy, 
Second,” Barrett went on quickly. 
“But we have to deal more realisti- 
cally. We’re faced with a number of 
anomalies we simply couldn’t have 
anticipated.” Quickly she indicated 
Klass’ report. “What I thought was 
storm runoff into the stream, for 
instance, is an oily substance instead. 
It’s—” Her head spun at the clatter of 
footsteps. Her door rattled urgently. 

It was L’Abbott, his broad face 
strained. “Head—” 

“Are the search crews out of the 
trees?” 

“No. They’ve found the girl’s 
body. The water came up. She’s 
floating. They’re casting ropes for 
her. They’re-” 

Barrett’s voice rose sharply. “You 
didn’t get those people out of the 
trees?” 

“I couldn’t. They won’t leave!” 

B ARRETT glanced urgently to 
the window, then hurried from 
her office through the dome. Reach- 
ing the lawn, she stared up into the 
black face of the storm. She peered 
toward the trees. Any activity there 
was effectively screened from sight. 
And there wasn’t time to send 
L’Abbott back or to take the hover- 
scooter out herself. Wind was already 
slapping and howling. 



SWEET SISTER, GREEN BROTHER

Diallo reached her side. “Head?” 
Quickly she explained. “So we 
have thirty or forty people under 
those trees,” she concluded. “But if 
they aren’t panicking now, with the 
storm already so near—” 

“They were briefed?” 

She nodded. “But if they don’t 
have the same overdeveloped sensiti- 
vity members of the Order have, or 
perhaps if they’re distracted or no 
more affected than Carlo Hegg evi- 
dently was—” 

“Or if the peak of fear has not yet 
been reached,” Diallo interjected. 

Barrett nodded, turning. “Well, 
we’d better get inside, Second. It’s 
out of our hands.” 

Inside L’ Abbott’s news had 
reached everyone. Faces were pasty, 
voices low. Then their words were 
drowned by the growl of the beast 
and he was upon them— black belly, 
flickering fingers. Clearplas was first 
spattered, then voraciously licked 
dry. 

Barrett strode through the dome. 
Laer was in the first conference 
room. “The girl— accident or sui- 
cide?” she demanded. 

For once the burly young juvenile 
director was somber. “Head, I don’t 
think she had enough stuff to take 
herself out for drowning.” 

Barrett agreed. “She had devel- 
oped dependence on the trees. She 
probably slipped out of the dorm, 
intending to return before dawn. 
Instead she was caught under the 
trees when we had that night storm.” 
“Sure. Scared and confused, run- 



ning the wrong way in the dark- 
splash!” 

“Well, she’d been warned, along 
with everyone else.” Barrett hadn’t 
much sympathy to spare. 

Before she left Laer, L’Abbott 
found her again. “Head— the 
searchers are running! In the open!” 

Grimly Barrett hurried to the 
front of the dome. The windows 
were massed. She pushed to the 
nearest. Half a dozen members of the 
search party ran wild. Three raced 
toward settlement bounds. Three 
others scattered along the line of 
trees. 

She pushed back from the win- 
dow. “Milario! L’Abbott! I want 
every entrance guarded. Don’t let 
anyone out! If any of those runners 
make it this far, open to them!” 

Any. The word rang heavily in 
Barrett’s mind. The settlers couldn’t 
afford to lose workers. Their crops 
would have to be hand-irrigated 
through summer and early fall. After 
harvest they intended to move into 
new fields, pursuing a different 
scheme of cultivation. They needed 
every hand. 

Milario and L’Abbott assigned per- 
sonnel to the doors. Barrett pushed 
grimly to the window again. 

Two of the runners had regained 
control and had thrown themselves 
flat. It became apparent that a third 
was not running in panic but pursu- 
ing a fourth. As they neared settle- 
ment bounds he launched himself, 
bringing the other man down. Barrett 
could feel tension lessen around her. 



98 



GALAXY 




Only two people were exposed now, 
one plunging back in the direction of 
the trees, stumbling, regaining her 
feet, falling again. And the other— 

“It’s Orth!” 

His blue worksuit appeared self- 
animated as he pounded past the two 
struggling men on the ground and 
flung himself across the lawn. His 
face was contorted, his neck corded. 

The jagged white finger that 
reached to impale him fused him 
briefly into its own blinding column. 
His face was momentarily lost in 
light as every detail of the world was 
vividly overexposed. Then the fiery 
finger split and spat at the two 
nearest dorms, rending air. The world 
shook. 

Reality returned. Light was gone. 
All that remained was two men 
pressed against the ground. Orth 
sprawled supine with head twisted 
and eyes vacant, and the terrible 
silence. 

Barrett pushed from the window 
again. She fought to the main door. 
Quickly she chose her men. “Whip- 
per, Danakil— crawl out there and 
drag that man in. Don’t raise so 
much as a hand above the ground. 
Heads down too.” 

The door was opened and the two 
plunged out. 

“Down!” Barrett shrieked, her 
face fierce. 

They threw themselves flat and 
wriggled away. “Back from the 
doors,” Barrett cried. “Everyone 
along the walls. If we get that man 
in, we’ll need room.” 



Whipper and Danakil got him in. 
Laer, one of the handful who had 
taken med units, was summoned. 
Barrett and Jones spelled him work- 
ing over the lax body. Despite their 
efforts, the body remained just that. 
When Barrett finally stood her voice 
was hollow. “We’ve lost two people.” 
the words held no reality. She met 
Diallo’s eyes. Her jaw set. Today the 
storm had proven a successful preda- 
tor after all. 

Time passed and there was 
still another incursion upon the 
union of trees and waters. And 
though consciousness was 
tenuous, channeled largely into 
the murmurous refrain that de- 
fined their joint existence, 
both brother and sister sensed 
the content of the incursion 
and were uneasy. For although 
the voices were chaotic in ex- 
pression— kill, save, destroy, 
live, conquer, own,— they were 
united in intent. And that in- 
tent was somehow, in some 
incomprehensible way, threat- 
ening. 

Uneasily green brother’s 
lower leaves rippled. He had 
defended himself and sweet sis- 
ter against old Fliiyr’s winds 
and fiery fingers since the be- 
ginning of time. But this incur- 
sion was not storm. And so it 
did not stimulate his usual re- 
sponses. His sentinel leaves did 
not stir. His capillaries did not 
compress. His fluids did not 



SWEET SISTER, GREEN BROTHER 



99 




flow. He did not know how to 
defend against what he felt on 
the air today. He had been 
provided with no mechanism. 

Sweet sister was equally 
helpless in her disturbance. 
Green brother did not cry, did 
not plead. And she did not 
swell and darken. Yet there 
was danger, dimly appre- 
hended, not at all understood. 

Then green brother became 
aware of assault to his lower 
trunk. He did not feel pain 
because he did not have capa- 
city for that. He did feel a 
certain helpless dread. For 
soon his bark was penetrated, 
his woody fibers slashed. Even 
as he stood there, life’s fluid 
began to leak from the wound. 
And then, at first haltingly, his 
sentinel leaves signaled their 
own movement through the 
air. 

Their flight was brief. There 
was a jarring of the soil and 
green brother was fallen, his 
sentinel leaves brushing near 
the ground. His life’s blood 
drained upon the soil and bled 
away. Consciousness lessened. 

Green brother was fallen, 
yet he did not die. Because he 
was not one. Nor was he many. 
He was one-who-was-many and 
as yet only a very small portion 
of that union died. Sweet sister 
was disturbed nevertheless. Be- 
cause when earth jarred, her 
own body was suddenly ex- 



posed. The rays of the sun 
reached in to touch her, only 
in one small zone to be sure, 
but the sensation was acutely 
unpleasant. It was not right. 
Never in all time had it hap- 
pened. She quivered, suffered 
vulnerability and the violation 
of order. But she flowed on, 
even though she could voice no 
more than a plaintive, I flow, 
green brother . 

The answer came. Flow, sis- 
ter, and bring me your sweet 
moisture. I defend . 

But green brother’s voice 
lacked assurance. For now he 
felt his bark penetrated again, 
felt his woody fibers slashed 
and chopped again, felt his 
life’s fluid begin to leak from 
still another wound. His leaves 
shivered. Green brother experi- 
enced the beginning of a new 
and terrible dread. 

IV 

D IALLO was completing weekly 
inventory on food stores when 
the felling crew returned to the 
settlement. Disturbed by the word 
that accompanied their return, he 
closed inventory, returned the books 
to their shelf and logged off duty. 

Diallo appreciated the expediency 
of clearing a stretch of the stream- 
side. Irrigation crews would necessa- 
rily draw stream water daily for the 
next few months. And Vella’s death 
and Orth’s had bred an atmosphere 



100 



GALAXY 




of vengeful hysteria concerning the 
trees. So the settlers had voted not 
just to clear passage to the water but 
to assert mastery over this world and 
its forces. Nevertheless as Diallo set 
across the field toward the line of 
trees, he was disturbed. 

He hadn’t walked far when the 
hoverscooter fluttered near. Barrett 
leaned out. “Ride, Second?” 

Her face reflected his own distur- 
bance. Agtech Klass was impassive in 
the passenger’s seat. Diallo scrambled 
into the cargo hold. 

Reaching the streamside, they 
hung over the scene briefly. Only 
three trees had been felled today. 
But they were giants. They sprawled 
across the land, limbs crushed, life’s 
blood oozing across the bare soil to 
spill into the stream. Diallo peered 
down. An unmistakable stench filled 
the air. 

Barrett took the scooter down and 
they disembarked. They were 
dwarfed by the fallen giants. Diallo 
glanced at Barrett’s set face. “The 
odor, Head—” 

She nodded tightly. “It was re- 
ported accurately. It’s the storm 
odor.” 

It was, repellent and thick. 

Klass paced the length of the 
nearest tree, took a thin plastic blade 
from his tool belt, and dipped it into 
the gray substance that drained from 
the tree. He squinted at his sample, 
sniffed it. “No need to take it back 
to the shed for comparison, Head. 
It’s the same stuff I strained out of 
those storm water samples. That 



smell— has to be. Surprised the cut- 
ters stuck it out in this stench.” 

Barrett stared at the woody base 
of the tree. “So here’s our pollutant, 
Klass.” Her words fell flat. 

Diallo studied them, aware that 
they shared information of which he 
was ignorant. “This substance has 
already undergone analysis, 
Headsw’an?” 

“It has.” Barrett’s face was sud- 
denly older. “I intended to share 
the report with you the day you 
returned from upstream, Second. But 
we were interrupted. And in the 
subsequent hysteria Klass and I de- 
cided to withhold the information 
from discussion for the time being.” 
She hesitated. “The substance in the 
storm-water samples I had Nellis 
take— and evidently it comes from 
the trees— is by every indication quite 
poisonous. Possibly lethal to humans. 
And we suspect that if we irrigated 
with uncleaned water it would kill 
the crops too.” 

Diallo peered at the substance on 
Klass’s blade, stunned. “Then each 
time it rains, the stream becomes 
poisonous?” His question seemed un- 
real. 

“For three hours or longer,” Bar- 
rett confirmed. 

“The pollutant is an oily com- 
pound, Second,” Klass clarified. 
“Doesn’t ride the top of the water 
as you’d expect. Intermixes? Maybe 
colloid’s the word I’m hunting. May- 
be not. I only follow the procedures 
in the text, so don’t expect me to 
talk like a chemmer. But I was able 



SWEET SISTER, GREEN BROTHER 



101 




to strain a little of it out. The 
rest— well, who knows what happens 
to it when the water clears? I haven’t 
been drinking a lot lately, that’s one 
fact I give you without fear of 
contradiction.” 

“But if the substance comes from 
the trees, isn’t it reasonable to hypo- 
thesize that it returns to the same 
place?” Barrett suggested. 

To the trees. Diailo did not re- 
spond. Intensely troubled, he turned 
and paced to the stream’s edge. Each 
new finding was freshly disturbing. 
When storm stalked the trees, they 
not only experienced— and communi- 
cated— fear, they also discharged 
their life’s blood into the stream. At 
his feet, the fallen tree’s sap oozed 
thickly down the steep bank, graying 
the water. 

“Makes sense they’d absorb it 
back,” Klass affirmed. “Now if you 
want to try storing this stuff for fuel 
purposes, Head, we could probably 
tap it out of the other trees before 
felling them. Take a little rigging—” 
Barrett joined Diailo at stream’s 
eage, shaking her head. “No. We 
don’t have the technology for remov- 
ing the stench, now, Klass. We’ll keep 
it in mind for future development.” 
Her features did not express the 
degree of optimism her words 
seemed to indicate. 

Diailo stared at hej, new informa- 
tion slowly taking possession of his 
thoughts. “This substance, the tree 
sap— it’s inflammable, Head?” 

She nodded briskly. “Highly.” 

He continued to stare at her, 



further question forming in his mind, 
unwelcome, unwanted. It had to be 
expressed. “But then why doesn’t 
lightning set fire to the trees, 
Headsw’an? If the sap is highly in- 
flammable, the entire line of trees 
should burn when lightning scores a 
direct hit upon any single tree.” 
They had all seen lightning touch the 
trees harmlessly many times. 

Eyes met. No one wanted to ans- 
wer. “Because,” Diailo supplied fi- 
nally, “when storm approaches, the 
trees discharge their -inflammable- 
sap into the stream.” 

Klass’ lips seemed numb. “But 
then the water itself could be ignited, 
Second. Because the proportion of 
oily stuff in some of those sam- 
ples-” 

“But the stream is protected from 
lightning by the trees,” Diailo said 
softly. 

Three glances turned upon the 
stream. Sunlight glinted from its 
freshly exposed surface. “The water 
is protected by the trees,” Barrett 
said softly. “And in a way the water 
protects the trees too, by carrying 
the sap until danger of lightning 
passes.” 

No one wanted to say more. The 
stream lay before them, three of its 
guardians slain. It was Diailo who 
finally spoke again. “Head, does it 
seem to you that the water is rising?” 
Barrett nodded numbly. “It is.” 

T HEY rode air back toward the 
settlement. “Head, I could be 
wrong,” Klass asserted. “The samples 



102 



GALAXY 




I burned in the shed didn’t have 
water content to extinguish them. 
But the stream— that a lot of water, 
Head. I’ve never seen water burn.” 

“However it is possible that light- 
ning itself could produce some signif- 
icant change in the electrical orienta- 
tion of the substances in the stream,” 
Diallo pointed out, groping helplessly 
through his dimly grasped under- 
standing of chemical reactions. “That 
could contribute to and support in- 
flammability.” 

They reached the mooring hook 
and scrambled from the hovercraft. 
Settlers hurried to shelter. Diallo 
turned to face the darkening sky and 
fear touched them. Here they had 
stumbled upon a survival system that 
had probably existed through most 
of eternity. Today they had dis- 
turbed that system. Perhaps they had 
seriously weakened it. And now the 
panther strode down the line of 
trees, thrusting his black face near, 
teeth bared. 

Diallo entered the dome. The 
breath of the beast misted clearplas 
panes, then sucked them dry. Then 
the sky shattered with fiery dis- 
charges. Thunder snarled. The beast 
prowled the trees, licking, tasting, 
seeking. 

He found vulnerability. He leapt 
suddenly astride the exposed stretch 
of stream. His quivering bolts struck 
down to the water’s surface, the 
fulfillment of the hunt. 

Diallo heard a scream behind him. 
“The water’s burning!” He did not 
turn. Hands flattened against the 



pane, he watched flame rip down the 
surface of the stream, watched steam 
boil up, watched the trees’ dis- 
charged sap flung back upon them in 
a cloud, watched as the trees ex- 
ploded into flame. Diallo did not 
move, did not cry, but he felt the 
pain of the trees, the agony of the 
waters and the fierce exultation of 
the beast. Then the fire moved both 
upstream and down and the scene 
was lost in billows of steam and 
smoke. 

And the fire that destroyed trees 
and stream was to destroy Diallo. 
Not today, perhaps not tomorrow. 
But one day soon. He knew it. 

44Q EE you at noon rest, Head,” 
kJ»Laer promised as he lofted 
his four youngest charges and 
scudded to the head of the column. 
Barrett watched him establish course 
directly planet-east before she turned 
for a last look at the stripped settle- 
ment. Six of the twelve dorms and a 
number of sheds had been disas- 
sembled for transport across the 
plain. Settlers who didn’t have a 
hand in their transport carried seeds 
and supplies on their backs, personal 
possessions in their hands. Barrett 
regretted the necessity of abandoning 
the headman’s dome. “Maybe the 
evaluation ship will lift it over for us 
if we don’t get back for it.” 

Diallo made no response. He 
stared toward the burned-out trees, 
devastation in his eyes. 

Barrett frowned. The hike planet- 
east would require a week, perhaps 



SWEET SISTER, GREEN BROTHER 



103 




longer. Then they would reach a 
tree-shaded stream running parallel 
to this one. Milario had located it by 
scooter. This time, when they estab- 
lished their settlement, they would 
act upon solid knowledge of planet 
conditions. They would not clear 
broad fields for planting, for in- 
stance. Instead they would remove 
native vegetation from narrow bands 
of soil, cultivating only shallowly. It 
might prove necessary to irrigate, but 
there was hope to the east. 

There was no hope in Diallo’s 
eyes. “Head, the streams intercon- 
nect. The survey report clearly states 
it. With each storm, damage to the 
trees will extend farther, until even- 
tually it reaches us again. Until even- 
tually the sky has consumed all the 
water.” 

Barrett’s face tightened. "You just 
have a theory, Diallo. You won’t 
destroy everything by expounding it 
to the party, will you?” 

Diallo’s eyes moved along the 
horizon. “I won’t. It makes no dif- 
ference now.” 

“Good.” The party was in posses- 
sion of the facts as Barrett saw them. 
To present them with Diallo’s poetic 
interpretations of apocalyptic visions 
could serve no purpose. 

They turned and walked after the 
others. They had not gone far before 
Diallo touched Barrett’s arm. He 
pointed back toward the trees. 

Silently another giant wind funnel 
had formed over the exposed stream. 
It dipped into the water and spun 
moisture up into the thirsty reaches 



of the sky, diffusing it quickly into 
cloud. “The wind has come again.” 

It had, the wind that had slain 
their fledgling crops. Barrett’s shoul- 
ders tensed painfully. They were 
fleeing not just the morale-shattering 
devastation of the trees, the ever 
more vicious electrical storms, but 
also the destructive winds that had 
moved into the area like scavengers 
gathering around an unguarded kill. 

Fortunately Diallo said nothing. 
He did not tell Barrett again that the 
sky was a predator intent upon strip- 
ping the land of water, that it had 
fattened and strengthened on its first 
meal, that now it would return and 
feed again until it had consumed 
every morsel. He said none of those 
things again. 

Because he had promised not to 
say them again. 

The spout dissipated, sending 
vicious winds whipping over the land. 
Determined, Barrett turned and fol- 
lowed the column, her eyes set upon 
the eastern sky. There the sun was a 
rosy red egglet, the sky a clear violet 
expanse. When the air that enveloped 
this planet had taken enough mois- 
ture, it had to release some of it 
again in the form of rain. There were 
certain natural laws that governed 
any world. 

Even this one? Barrett did not 
permit' herself to dwell on that half- 
articulated question. There were 
trees and waters and fields ahead. 
And her people strode like pioneers. 

So would she, as long as Diallo 
remained silent. *

Y OU can’t neck in a spacesuit. 

The best thing Sonya and I 
could do was sit down on a flat rock 
about fifty meters upslope from the 
instrument pack, hold hands and try 
to read each other’s impressions 
through the helmet visors. This time, 
though, we were mostly getting a last 
look at the Martian landscape. 

It was a landscape only a geologist 
could love. And Sonya loved it. It 
had everything I had seen on the 
moon— pockmarks of craters and big 
gashed rills, hummocks and fissures 
and blowholes and scattered rocks 
from pebble to house size. There 
were some geologic differences and 
those made Sonya love it more. Also, 
you were heavier. And there were 
wind and duststonns. 

Sonya thought it was beautiful. If 
we’d had a year on Mars instead of 
only two months she might have 
talked me into thinking the same 



way. She could talk me into damned 
near anything when she tried hard. 

That last day we made our pickup 
on the instrument pack’s sampling 
capsules, climbed up to the rock we 
called the “loveseat” and got as close 
to each other as we could. That was 
one of the nice things about the new 
spacesuits, the skin-tight long-john 
variety. You couldn’t get as comfort- 
able in them as you could in shirt- 
sleeves, but at least you didn’t look 
and move like a drunken teddybear. 
In fact, Sonya was so small (and I’m 
only about a hundred-seventy centi- 
meters) that she could have sat on 
my lap if the life-support pack on her 
back hadn’t always been getting in 
the way. 

We had been up there about five 
minutes when Sonya said, “I want to 
come back here some day.” 

“You mean right here where we’re 
sitting? And put up a plaque reading: 
‘Here sat Lieutenant-Colonel Henry 
Jacobs and Sonya Gorchakova, the 
first interplanetary romance—’ ” 

“No, silly.” She patted my shoul- 
der. “To Mars. To this whole planet. 
It’s a real world, not like the moon. 
Some day we could give it more air 
and water and millions of people 
could live here.” 

She must have noticed the skepti- 
cal way I looked out at the land- 
scape, because die giggled and said, 
“All right, I forget. You test pilots 
have no soul. But I love you anyway. 
I sometimes wonder why.” 

I wasn’t going to try to answer 
that, not with Colonel Harvey maybe 



listening in on our conversation. I 
just said, “You’ve got funny tastes in 
scenery.” 

“Remember, I am Russian. I like 
emptiness. Sometimes when I am up 
here and you are somewhere else I 
can imagine that I am here alone, 
with the whole planet to myself.” 

I grinned and shook my head. 
Then an old quote came back to me 
and I said, “The grave’s a fine and 
private place/But none I think do 
there embrace. ” 

“Quite right,” said a voice in our 
earphones and we both jumped. “I 
think you two lovebirds had better 
haul ass back to the ship. We’re 
cutting things pretty fine on the 
Oh-Two, so I want everybody back 
here before I even think of cutting 
out the primary LSS.” 

I sighed. “We’re coming, boss.” 

Of course he was right. The ascent 
module of the Grissom had a secon- 
dary life-support system for use dur- 
ing the trip up to our orbital rendez- 
vous with the transport ship, 
Gagarin. The primary LSS was in the 
descent module and would be discon- 
nected and left on Mars, so that we 
wouldn’t have the problem of haul- 
ing its considerable weight back up 
into orbit. However, the secondary 
LSS was a short-duration affair— if 
we didn’t rendezvous and dock with- 
in thirty-six hours after cutting out 
the primary LSS, we’d be having a 
lot of trouble breathing. 

I T HAD been five months from 
Earth out to Mars orbit. The 



106 



GALAXY 




landing ship, the Grissom, rode on a 
one-way robot propulsion module, 
while the Gagarin, the orbit-to-orbit 
ship that would take is all back 
home, slid along about a thousand 
meters away. Every three days two 
of us would EVA over from the 
Gagarin to the Grissom and supple- 
ment the telemetry readings by an 
eyeball check of major systems. 

Sonya and I made the first check 
three days after Mars Orbit Injection 
burn, when we were already farther 
out than anybody had gone before. 
It got to Sonya— well, it got to me 
too, being out there, even though 
space itself doesn’t look any differ- 
ent. It doesn’t show' any footprints 
or tracks even in close-Earth orbit, 
where we’ve been dumping garbage 
for thirty years. And out that far- 
well, I know I caught myself looking 
back over my shoulder suddenly, 
trying to surprise whatever or who- 
ever was watching me. It might have 
got to be a bad problem for me 
without Sonya. 

We could talk privately over our 
suit radios when we were out of 
line-of-sight from the Gagarin and we 
could always talk by touching hel- 
mets. And talk was all we could do. 
We were both single. We could (and 
by the time we were halfway to Mars 
we knew we would) get married 
when we got home and make up for 
lost time. But this pairing-off we 
were doing was exactly what the 
psych boys had worried about when 
they discussed a mixed crew for the 
expedition. If we had gone any 



farther than we did, either Novikov 
or Harvey or both might have felt 
they had to break us up. That might 
have led to the first space mutiny, 
but fortunately we never had to find 
out. 

They let us talk, so we talked all 
across two hundred million kilo- 
meters of space. We traded bits of 
personal impressions, which were get- 
ting more personal as time went on, 
memories and, from the halfway 
point on, plans for our future. No 
politics. Either we didn’t disagree, or 
neither of us cared enough about 
them to make a fight where we did. 
And of course there was the big 
point of the indoctrination they had 
hammered into all twelve of us: No 
Political Arguments. The joint ex- 
pedition was a high-level experiment, 
so that bit at least made more sense 
than most of the rest of the in- 
doctrination. 

That was where matters stood 
with us when we slid into Mars orbit. 
We stayed up there for a month, 
photomapping, picking our landing 
spot and running all the tests in the 
Mission Profile and a few more we 
improvised on the spot. On Circum- 
Mars + 27 we started checking out 
the Grissom. 

The Grissom had two parts, like to 
old Apollo LEM’s— an ascent module 
and a descent module. But she was 
much bigger and fancier. She was a 
cone fifteen meters in diameter 
across the heat shield on the base and 
twenty-two meters tall. She weighed 
over a hundred tons ready for injec- 



HER FINE AND PRIVATE PLANET 



107 




tion into her landing orbit. Her 
powerplant was a lightweight Nimrod 
reactor heating Monopropellant B 
that gave her higher performance 
levels and a much bigger margin for 
error than the Apollonauts ever had. 

The descent module carried most 
of the fuel, the heat shield, the four 
articulated landing legs, the primary 
LSS, the storage compartment and 
all the gear holding the two modules 
together. The ascent module carried 
the reactor and its supporting sys- 
tems, the crew compartment, the 
computers and nav-com gear, the 
samples storage compartment, the 
secondary LSS and enough fuel to 
get the whole thing off Mars and into 
a rendezvous orbit with the Gagarin. 

Between them the two modules 
were supposed to get five people 
down on Mars with two months’ of 
supplies and the equipment for ex- 
ploring out to about a fifty-kilometer 
radius from the landing site. This 
meant an electric tractor, two inflat- 
able shelters with their own life- 
support systems, sounding rockets, 
explosive charges, drills, centrifuges, 
sterile sample boxes, thermal cover- 
alls, clean socks, band-aids, and all the 
rest. When they had explored, the 
five would climb back into the ascent 
module and ascend. 

The touchdown went off well. The 
big ring of solid-fuel rockets around 
the Grissom’s base retro-fired for 
about eighty seconds, then separated 
and we slid into landing orbit. We got 
a little help from the Martian atmos- 
phere on the way down (that’s why 



the heat shield), then about fifty 
kilometers up we jettisoned the 
shield, cut in the main engine, and 
sailed along for another two hundred 
kilometers to a perfect four-point 
landing. We waited about ten min- 
utes for the ground to cool off. Then 
we suited up, climbed down to the 
surface of Mars, planted the UN, US, 
USSR, British, Swedish, French, Jap- 
anese, National Geographic Society 
and Royal Interplanetary Society 
flags, unloaded the storage compart- 
ment, set up the shelters (one lab, 
one living quarters) and went to 
work. 

What we found is in all the reports 
and isn’t all that interesting anyway. 
Most of it simply confirms what our 
orbital observations and the Mariner 
and Voyager unmanned probes back 
in the 70’s and 60’s had already 
suggested. Mars is apparently lifeless, 
although our one trip wasn’t enough 
to prove that. It is pretty short on air 
and water and there is much more 
seismic activity than on the moon. 
There is a little less impact cratering, 
but some of the craters are real 
monsters. Mars, after all, is closer to 
the asteroid belt. 

The canals do exist, but beyond 
that we didn’t do much to solve the 
mystery. Our tractor broke down 
before we could drive over to the 
nearest major canal system, so all we 
brought back was a lot of photo- 
graphs from orbit. They look like 
pictures of parallel bands of fractures 
and faults. Obviously number-one 
priority for the next expedition had 



108 



GALAXY 




better be a canal survey and they’d 
better bring mountain-climbing gear 
for it. Some of those fractures are 
canyons two kilometers deep. 

Not getting to the canals was 
frustrating, but in spite of that we 
picked up well over a ton of supplies, 
ran ourselves and our equipment 
ragged and were usually so busy we 
forgot we were engaged in a great 
heroic pioneering enterprise. That 
shouldn’t be any surprise. If you let 
yourself do the kind of thinking 
about what you’re doing that makes 
for good reading in the popular 
magazines, you have to be more 
concerned with your own thoughts 
than with the job at hand. And if 
you let yourself go that far in space 
very often, you don’t live to write 
about it anywhere. 

Sonya and I again managed to get 
teamed up fairly often, and we soon 
discovered that flat rock well up the 
crater wall that the gave the best 
view of any place within walking 
distance of the camp. Quite a lot of 
the planned work had to be scrubbed 
after the tractor gave out, so in these 
last three weeks we had plenty of 
chances to sit down by ourselves and 
talk for a few minutes. 

We didn’t talk about ourselves as 
much as before. I think we both felt 
we knew each other‘s minds well 
enough for the time being. We de- 
cided one personal matter— we would 
live in the U.S. But mostly we talked 
about developing a Martian colony, 
then maybe, if the planet could be 
terra-formed somehow— with enough 



time and energy, a Martian civiliza- 
tion. Eventually she had me believing 
it. 

AFTER Colonel Harvey signed off 
X V we sat silent for a moment. 
Then we stood up, brushed the grit 
off our suits and headed down- 
slope toward the path back to the 
Grissom. The marker poles with then- 
reflectors were still sticking in the 
rock. We would leave them there and 
maybe some day somebody would 
have the time and shipping space to 
spare to go around and pick them up 
for museums. 

We reached the camp and passed 
the deflated shelters. The dead trac- 
tor was out of sight behind a spur of 
rock. The instruments we were 
leaving behind had all been dis- 
tributed to their various stations. A 
lot of discarded gear was lying 
around and the whole camp was a 
pretty depressing sight. 

The Grissom stood about two hun- 
dred yards beyond the camp, squat- 
ting over the patch of cinders and 
glass her landing flare had made. 
They must have seen us coming, 
because they ran the little trolley 
down its tracks on the ship’s side 
even before we reached the base and 
pressed, the call button. Sonya went 
up first, so while I wasn’t the first 
man on Mars (that was Harvey’s 
privilege), I was the last one off it. 
Then the trolley came down again. I 
got on, and they winched me in. I 
climbed in through the hatch— it 
closed behind me and the compart- 



HER FINE AND PRIVATE PLANET 



109 




ment repressurized. I stripped off my 
suit and stuck it in die ejection 
compartment with all the other extra 
gear that would be dumped just 
before we lifted off. Two minutes 
later I was in the upper chamber of 
the crew cabin and slipping into my 
couch. 

The three crew couches— Harvey’s, 
mine, and Viktor Shrebnin’s, the 
systems engineer’s— were arranged in 
a half-circle on the upper level, with 
instrument and computer and radar 
consoles over and under and around 
them in the usual claustrophobic 
way. Down below, Sonya and Cesar 
Vaubois, the biochemist, shared the 
floor space with food, personal gear, 
sample lockers and the pressure 
hatch to the airlock level and space- 
suit storage. 

If they ever build a spaceship that 
doesn’t require a thorough manual 
systems check before liftoff, I’ll 
stand amazed and as far away from 
her as possible. I believe in com- 
puters, but I also believe in visual 
displays and the Mark I Model A 
eyeball. We used both aboard the 
Grissom. It took us over an hour 
before Harvey turned to me. 

He said, “Hank, ring up the 
general and tell him we’re about 
ready to take off our skirt.” 

I got on the radio and started 
calling, “ Gagarin , Grissom calling,” 
and I went on until Novikov came 
back with, “Roger, Grissom, we read 
you.” 

“All ascent module systems acti- 
vated. Primary LSS disconnected. We 



are go for stage disconnect.” 

“Taking off our skirt,” or “stage 
disconnect” (Novikov was a stickler 
for proper terminology) meant firing 
the explosive bolts and then trigger- 
ing the spring-loaded latches that 
held the ascent module locked in its 
cradle inside the descent module. 
Our name for it came from the fact 
that the ascent module lifting off and 
climbing out of the cradle looked 
like a woman climbing out of a 
particularly broad, stiff skirt. 

I punched the arming button on 
the explosive bolts, waited thirty 
seconds after the light flashed red, 
then punched the firing button. 
Eight sets of bolts fired with a rolling 
whant - and the ship quivered slightly. 

I looked up at the status lights for 
the eight latches. Four at the base of 
the cradle, four up around the neck 
at the top of the descent module’s 
cone. All eight lights showed green 
for “latches engaged.” There was a 
single switch for unlocking all eight. I 
pulled open its cover plate and flick- 
ed it across. 

Clang, clunk, clung, skunk! It 
sounded beautiful. I looked up at the 
status lights. Seven had gone red, 
seven latches had disengaged. Num- 
ber eight was still green. I frowned. 
Harvey looked at me, looked at the 
status lights and said disgustedly, 
“Shit.” 

Silence. I flicked the switch gently 
two or three more times. The light 
stayed green. Viktor let out a long 
breath. 

Novikov’s voice came through the 



110 



GALAXY 




hiss and crackle on the radio. “Ga- 
garin to Grissom. Are you having a 
difficulty?” 

Harvey replied: 

“Grissom here. Status lights indi- 
cate number three upper latch did 
not disconnect on upper three latch. 
We are canceling initiation of the 
countdown until we find out what’s 
wrong.”' 

Throat-clearing noises on the cir- 
cuit, then: “Very good, Grissom. 
LOS on this pass in about five 
minutes. We will check back with 
you when we reacquire. Good luck.” 
“Thanks,” said Harvey. Then, 
more to himself: “We may need it.” 

W E SETTLED down to finding 
out what was wrong. First, was 
the latch still in place? We knew that 
status lights had given wrong readings 
too many times for us to rule out the 
possibility that the latch had tripped 
just as it was supposed to and we 
were sitting and staring at a defective 
light. It would be pretty damned 
embarrassing if we went and did 
something drastic while the latch was 
all the time snugly retracted. 

But if it wasn’t retracted, we were 
going to have to do something dras- 
tic. We couldn’t lift off with the four 
tons of the empty descent module 
still fastened to our tail and have any 
hope of reaching orbit. If it didn’t 
hold on, it might break loose some- 
where along the trajectory and 
tumble us out of control. We might 
wind up crashing back to Mars at full 
speed or charging wildly off into 



space, so that if by some chance we 
did reach orbit we could never ren- 
dezvous with the Gagarin before our 
oxygen ran out. Except that we were 
going to be out of oxygen anyway 
within thirty-six hours whether we 
tried to lift off or just sat on Mars 
contemplating our inputs and out- 
puts. 

Since all the things we might have 
to do were not only drastic but 
dangerous, the first thing we did was 
to pull off the status-light panel and 
check the accessible parts of the 
circuitry for malfunction. That was 
ticklish enough and doing it carefully 
enough to avoid causing damage took 
us nearly two hours. Halfway 
through our work Novikov came 
back on the radio. He got a progress 
report, then wisely shut up and let us 
work. 

By the time he came around again 
we could tell him that if there were 
any circuit defect it wasn’t anywhere 
we could get at it. Therefore we 
would have to assume the latch was 
still engaged. Novikov didn’t like that 
at all. 

“Possibility,” he said. “Could you 
test for engagement by blasting with 
the main engines and watching the 
stress gauges?” 

“If we did it very carefully, yes,” 
said Harvey. “But it would cut into 
our fuel reserves. Can the Gargarin 
maneuver to compensate if we take a 
piece out of our rendezvous capa- 
bility?” 

A moment of silence, with voices 
off. 



HER FINE AND PRIVATE PLANET 



111 




Then: “Yes. We are at one hun- 
dred and twelve percent of our fuel 
reserves for docking and rendezvous 
maneuver. We can fill in for you.” 

“All right. We’ll blast at the abso- 
lute minimum thrust needed to regis- 
ter engagement. We can’t risk dis- 
torting the latch if it’s still engaged.” 
Viktor nodded enthusiastically at 
that. 

So Novikov signed off again and 
we sat down to arrange things. Just 
in case the latch had tripped and we 
started climbing freely as thrust built 
up, we decided to wait until the next 
window for a reasonably fast— six 
hours or less— rendezvous with the 
Gagarin. That meant about a forty - 
minute wait, so I unstrapped and 
climbed down into the lower level to 
talk to Sonya and Cesar Vaubois. 

Passengers in a spaceship have one 
advantage. The ship is so small and 
they are so thoroughly briefed on its 
workings that they usually have a 
fairly clear idea of the situation when 
something goes wrong. They don’t 
have to sit in their cabins or their 
seats and bite their nails while some- 
where off in the dim dark distance 
the captain or the pilot is sitting and 
biting his nails while the instruments 
tell him the sad story. So the two 
scientists were in no worse spirits 
than the three of us upstairs. 

Vaubois grinned at me as I came 
down. “It is at hard times like 
these,” he said, “I could wish myself 
back in the days of Pasteur. A 
chemist could then make his dis- 
coveries sitting comfortably in his 



laboratory, not on some unbelievable 
planet in the middle of too-compli- 
cated machinery.” 

Sonya spread her hands in despair. 
“This hairy Luddite— he is always 
complaining about the machinery, 
the machinery. What would Pasteur 
have given for a chance to be here?” 
Vaubois shrugged and grinned again. 
There was nothing wrong with mo- 
rale downstairs, so I climbed back up 
and sat down to wait for blast time. 

Harvey did the whole thing manu- 
ally, starting the thrust at four per 
cent and slowly pushing it up to 
seven, ten, twelve, fourteen, eigh- 
teen— 

—and the strain gauges lit up, 
bright red faces showing quivering 
needles slowly swinging up across the 
dials, and a warning horn blatted in 
our ears. Harvey’s big black hand 
clutched the throttle as if he wanted 
to tear it out by the roots and 
banged it hard down against the 
stops. There were clanks and clunks 
and pinging noises as we settled back 
into the cradle and loud curses in 
English, French, Russian, and Ar- 
menian. 

N OVIKOV was even unhappier 
than before when the Gagarin 
radioed us and we were still stuck. 
There wasn’t much he could do. 
however, except have a running ren- 
dezvous set up on the main com- 
puter, so they could blast to meet us 
any time we sprang ourselves loose. 
Also, wish us good luck, again, which 
was nice of him. 



112 



GALAXY 




We knew we were going to have to 
either trip the latch or cut it or break 
it somehow. Blasting with' the main 
engines at a higher thrust level wasn’t 
the way to do it— too much fuel 
expenditure, too much risk of dis- 
torting the latch, even the risk of 
ripping open the hull of the ascent 
module. It looked as though some- 
body was going to have to climb into 
the upper equipment bay of the 
descent module, get at the latch 
mechanism and cut it or hit it or 
something until it came free. And 
that somebody was now going to 
have to do it soon enough for us to 
rendezvous and dock with the Ga- 
garin in thirty-one hours. 

So we got out the drawings and 
started looking at our problem area. 
The hardware for the upper ring of 
latches was in the upper equipment 
bay of the descent module, along 
with lots of other miscellaneous ma- 
chinery. The engineers had used it as 
a sort of dumping ground for every- 
thing they couldn’t fasten on or plug 
in somewhere else. The bay itself ran 
around the top of the descent mod- 
ule and was roughly the shape of a 
French-fried onion ring. There was 
one access hatch in the outer hull, so 
we didn’t see any big problem getting 
into the bay. 

Moving around inside it to the 
defective latch (on the opposite side 
of the ship from the hatch) was going 
to be another matter. To save space 
and weight, the designers had arrang- 
ed things so that the retracted latches 
simply snapped back into what little 



open space there was in the bay. The 
inside of that bay was a mess any- 
way, but with those retracted latches 
squatting in the path of whoever 
went inside to work on the jammed 
one, it was going to be next thing to 
impossible to move around in it. 

Viktor, as an engineer, was pretty 
angry over this lapse from “belt and 
suspenders” by his colleagues. But 
they were all back on Earth. He went 
on being angry in several languages 
for several minutes, then picked up 
the drawings and went down into the 
lower level, spread them out on one 
of the couches and began doing 
things with calipers and a slide rule 
over them. 

His tone was still angry when he 
climbed back up, followed by Sonya 
and Vaubois. He was also worried 
and that showed up in both his face 
and his voice. 

“I have reached a conclusion.” He 
looked ominously at the rest of us. 

“Can the melodrama, Viktor,” 
snapped the colonel. 

“All right. Someone can climb 
into the bay and release our trouble- 
some latch. But that bay is very tight 
quarters, with bends around equip- 
ment, sharp edges and little space. So 
the person climbing in there must be 
very small.” In spite of what Harvey 
had just said about melodrama Vik- 
tor paused for a few seconds. Maybe 
it was just to catch his breath, maybe 
to listen for the wheels turning. 

They were certainly turning in my 
head. Sonya was— by a good fifteen 
centimeters— the shortest of us all 



HER FINE AND PRIVATE PLANET 



113 




and slender besides. After the mo- 
ment it took me to remember this I 
slowly turned around and looked at 
her. So did everybody else. 

Viktor waited until everybody was 
staring at her and then, just as she 
was opening her mouth to speak, he 
went on: “Yes. Also, she cannot 
wear her life-support pack.” 

This time he got his effect right 
away. Everybody said “What?” or 
something like that, except for 
Sonya, who just looked at him. He 
ploughed on. 

“Yes. If you will see here—” we 
bent over the drawings— “there are 
two sharp bends here and here, 
around the emergency transponder 
power pack and the number-two 
sensor housing, where even Sonya 
would not be able to wriggle through 
if she were wearing the backpack. It 
would catch somewhere and she 
might be trapped. She might possibly 
be able to make it, but she cannot 
really do much wriggling in there if 
she does not wish to rip her suit.” 
That was a hard point to argue. 

All this put the ball in my court. I 
was the crew’s EVA equipment spe- 
cialist. I sat there for a bit, making 
up a mental list of the tilings I 
needed to check, then started check- 
ing them. 

EVA consumables at fourteen 
man-hours— we had plenty, since 
Sonya’s consumption was less than 
the mean figure. All five EVA suits 
were in the ejection compartment— 
but they could easily be pulled out, 
checked over and brought back on 



line. This would take more time than 
we really wanted to spend, but not 
dangerously much. Even recharging 
the backpacks was only going to add 
an extra half hour. 

Hoses. There were the headaches. 
The way Viktor described the ar- 
rangement we would have to use, 
Sonya would be like an old-fashioned 
helmet diver. She would be inside the 
bay, her backpack with its oxygen 
supply would be out by the access 
hatch and connecting her with it 
would be two five-meter hoses. 

That length was the big part of the 
problem. It was barely enough to 
allow her to get in there and have 
some slack for working, but it was 
every bit of the flexible metal hose 
we had. And to get that much we 
would have to fasten all the 60 -milli- 
meter lengths together with airtight 
seals and that would take more time. 
We could have solved the length 
problem by using the rubber labora- 
tory tubing, but it was too small and 
too likely to get brittle and then 
rupture. The temperature out there 
after sunset would be down to 
around minus eighty Celsius, which 
does funny things to rubber. 

I outlined all this and nobody said 
anything, until Harvey looked at the 
clock and said, “We’ll be coming up 
on the eighteen-hour mark by the 
time we’ve got the suits ready.” The 
eighteen-hour limit for continuous 
work dates back to the Apollo lunar 
flights and it’s not a bad idea— you 
get tired and you start doing things 
you can’t afford. Except that right

now we couldn’t really afford to put 
off the critical EVA for another sleep 
cycle. That would bring us down to 
about twenty-two hours of oxygen, 
which might not be enough if any- 
thing more went wrong. 

But if Sonya went out there are 
started working in that cramped 
equipment bay when she was tired, 
she might slip and then something 
would go wrong. Unless she thought 
she could sleep by herself while the 
other four of us banged around both 
compartments rigging the suits and 
the hoses. 

Harvey put the question to her. 

She nodded slowly and said, “I 
think— if I lie down and rest for the 
hours while you are working on the 
suits I will be ready for the work 
even if I do not sleep.” 

“Would you like a pill?” 

“The rules.” 

“Screw the rules.” 

She held up a hand. “No. For me, 
the pills make me sleepy for hours 
after I wake up. I will work better 
tired.” 

Harvey nodded sharply. “All right. 
Go park yourself in one of the 
control couches. Hank, pressurize the 
ejection compartment and let’s get to 
work on those suits.” 

The suits turned out to be an easy 
job and even the long hoses weren’t 
difficult— just time-consuming. If we 
hadn’t been working with one eye on 
the clock we’d have been in good 
shape. 

We gasketed the hoses with putty, 
then wrapped the gaskets several 



layers thick in epoxy tape. This 
didn’t improve their flexibility, but 
they didn’t have much to begin with. 
When we shot pressure through the 
hoses to test the new seals, there was 
still a very slight leakage at each 
joint, but not a critical one. In fact, 
the new seals tested out stronger 
than the built-in ones on the helmet 
and backpack. 

It was nagging, finicky work, and 
we were all feeling tired and cranky 
when we finished. Viktor took pho- 
tos of the whole arrangement, while 
Harvey sat and muttered, “Stupidest 
damn do-it-yourself project I ever 
saw.” Then he and Viktor climbed 
down to brief Sonya while I sat 
down and ran another set of tests on 
the hose connections. They didn’t 
really need it. I think I was doing it 
mostly to put off the moment when 
Sonya would have to go out there 
and take her chances on our 
cobbled-together arrangements. I 
suppose Harvey noticed this, but he 
didn’t say anything about it. I 
thanked him for that later. He didn’t 
say anything about my volunteering 
to go out with Sonya, either-maybe 
he thought the EVA expert was the 
logical man anyway. I suppose I 
ought to thank him for that, too. 

W HEN SONYA and I finally 
climbed out of the airlock the 
sun was almost down. There isn’t 
enough air on Mars to give much 
sunset effect unless the sun happens 
to set through a duststorm. We saw 
that a couple of times and it makes 



HER FINE AND PRIVATE PLANET 



115 




an absolutely beautiful blood-orange 
glow on the horizon. Without the 
dust the sun just drops until it 
reaches the horizon line. And then 
there’s a little gold patch on the 
horizon line for a couple of minutes 
while the sky purples and soon turns 
black very fast. Then the patch fades, 
the stars all come out, and it starts 
getting cold. And meanwhile ther- 
mals run past at maybe twenty 
meters per second, increasing the 
heat loss of anybody working out- 
side. That was why Sonya went out 
there with two pairs of thermal 
coveralls over her basic pressure suit. 
It made her bulkier, but still nothing 
like the old-style suits. We wouldn’t 
have had a hope in hell of getting 
anybody wearing one of those into 
the bay. 

Harvey turned on the external 
lights. We tied our safety lines on to 
the first attachment point outside 
the hatch. I got a good grip on the 
line and started my slow walk around 
the upper part of the cone to a point 
just below the access hatch to the 
equipment bay. It was like walking 
across the face of a glacier and that 
wind didn’t make it any easier. If I 
slipped, I might knock Sonya off. I 
certainly would break my helmet or 
my hose connections or something 
important when I hit the ground 
twenty meters below. 

I reached the hatch. Then, while 
Sonya made her trip, I kept one eye 
on her and the other on the hatch as 
I reached up and tripped the external 
latch. It opened, but the external 



lights didn’t show much inside. I 
transferred my lines and, when Son- 
ya reached me, pulled the flashlight 
off my belt and shone it inside the 
bay. 

It looked just as bad now as it had 
on the drawings. Sonya slid as close 
to me as the space would allow and 
stuck her head in. I saw her Ups move 
as she recited to herself the sequence 
of components she would have to 
crawl around. Then she braced her- 
self against the open hatch cover, one 
leg hooked over the rim of the 
opening, and began unbuckling her 
life-support backpack. 

When she had finished, she crouch- 
ed in the opening while I carefully 
picked up the pack and tied it firmly 
to the hatch mechanisms. While I was 
doing this Sonya was checking the 
tools on her belt. We didn’t know 
exactly what was causing the jam, so 
we had hooked everything we 
thought she might possibly need on 
the belt, including one of the laser 
torches with enough power to cut 
right through the latch if necessary. 
With everything that was hanging 
from it the belt weighed nearly half 
as much as she did. 

1 was getting edgier by the minute 
as she checked each tool. I wasn’t 
going to blame her— but was she 
getting cold feet? Maybe literally, 
since it must have been passing sixty 
below already? Finally she turned 
and nodded to me. I cut off my suit 
radio and leaned over to touch hel- 
mets with her, in case she had any- 
thing private she wanted to say to 



116 



GALAXY 




me. But the expression on her face 
was all business. I don’t think she 
even noticed I had switched’ off the 
radio. 

She just said, “Watch the hose for 
me,” kneeled, flicked on her own 
flashlight, and crawled forward into 
the bay. 

I watched her disappear bit by 
bit— head, shoulders, torso, hips, 
legs— until she was entirely out of 
sight. Then there was only the vibra- 
tion coming faintly through the 
metal of the ship, the jerking of the 
hose and the sudden darknesses and 
sudden glares of light as her flashlight 
shone down behind equipment or up 
against the low roof of the bay. I 
stuck my head in as far as I could 
without losing my grip on the out- 
side handholds and tried to follow 
her course as well as I could . 

She went in about three meters, as 
far as I could tell from the length of 
hose left, then stopped. Both the 
hose and the light stayed steady for a 
couple of minutes and I couldn’t feel 
any more vibration. I could hear her 
breathing getting heavier and once or 
twice something like half-audible 
Russian curses. Finally came a 
moment of total silence— then, just 
before I started getting really fright- 
ened, she said quietly, “I’m coming 
out.” I reached down and began 
taking in the slack on the hoses as 
they began jerking and twisting 
again. 

Sonya backed out of the bay, 
reappearing the same gradual way she 
had disappeared. When she was com- 



pletely out in the open I took a good 
look at her. The thermal coveralls 
were ripped in a couple of places and 
I fingered the tears lightly to make 
sure they didn’t cut into the basic 
suit underneath. 

She pushed my hand back gently 
and said, “Bad news, everybody. I 
can get through, all right, but these 
coveralls— they keep bunching up at 
the waist and catching. I think I must 
try taking them off.” 

Harvey came in with: “Are you 
sure you won’t get too cold?” 

“1 don’t think so.” Through her 
helmet faceplate I could see her 
drawing her lower lip back from her 
teeth, her normal gesture when she 
was getting impatient. 

Before I could say anything Har- 
vey went on: “All right. Go ahead. 
But if you start getting cold—” 

Sonya was already unbuckling her 
tool belt. I took it from her, laid it 
down on the deck and braced myself 
against my lines and the hatch cover 
to help her off with the coveralls. 
With both of us working on them 
they came off quickly. I rolled them 
up carefully and stowed them in a 
comer of the hatchway. 

With those shapeless coveralls off, 
Sonya had enough figure to show 
through the suit. I didn’t try to keep 
from looking at her. What bothered 
me was how everything was so clear- 
ly visible, as if I had a couple of extra 
senses. It bothered me particularly 
because this was how I sometimes 
started feeling just before an attack 
of vertigo and I couldn’t afford 



HER FINE AND PRIVATE PLANET 



117 




vertigo perched up out here in the 
cold and the wind, twenty meters up 
and Sonya needing my help. 

I finally looked at her so long and 
hard, trying to clear my head, that 
she noticed it. She didn’t mind being 
looked at most of the time, but I was 
afraid she might be bothered by my 
doing it now. Instead, she looked 
right back at me— the same kind of 
look I was giving her— reached out 
and squeezed my shoulders. Then she 
buckled the tool belt back on and 
began her crawl back into the bay. 

Tills time the hose kept moving. I 
finally saw the light stay steady and 
heard her say, “I am there. The latch 
is still in place. I am going to try the 
hammer first.” 1 heard her breathing 
as she twisted around to pull the 
hammer out of her belt, then I felt a 
faint shiver through the ship’s hull as 
she began tapping on the latch. 

It went on for five minutes as she 
pounded away, harder and harder. 

Then: “Nothing is happening. I am 
going to try the laser cutter.” 

There was a throat-clearing noise 
on the circuit from Viktor. “Sonya, I 
think it might go faster if you got at 
the retraction mechanism itself. Can 
you get at the access plate from 
where you are?” 

There was a little bit of silence, 
with a background of faster breath- 
ing. Then came scraping and clunking 
noises as Sonya shifted her position. 

“Yes.” Two sharp bumps. “I have 
released the fasteners. I am taking off 
the plate now.” 

“Be careful. If one of the bolts 



hasn’t fired, a sharp jar might set it 
off.” If one of the bolts hadn’t fired, 
the explosive might have become 
unstable through months of low. tem- 
peratures with the heat generated by 
landing creating a problem on top of 
that. 

Sonya was careful enough. I didn’t 
hear a thing for nearly a minute. 

Then there was a little click and: 
“Hatch is off. Both bolts fired but 
the spring didn’t operate. I am going 
to examine the spring housing.” 

I wasn’t keeping track of time so 
well now. I was getting nervous and I 
was beginning to get uncomfortably 
cold, although the wind was drop- 
ping. I reminded myself that Sonya 
must be getting cold even faster and 
listened. 

Finally I heard her say: “I cannot 
see all the way into the housing. But 
I think the spring has fractured. Yes, 
this end is loose and there are little 
shards of metal lying around.” 

“I’ll be damned,” came through 
from Harvey. 

“Sonya, is the laser torch work- 
ing?” 

“Yes.” 

“Put it on a medium setting and 
cut along a line about eight centi- 
meters below the base of the latch.” 

“The latch?” 

“Yes. Once you cut through the 
plating there, you can stick some sort 
of a lever through it and pry the 
latch free. Be careful-don’t heat up 
or damage the retaining bar of the 
latch— or we’ll never get it free!” 

“Why not have her put the laser 



118 



GALAXY 




directly on the latch and slice it in 
two?” 

“It might fracture if we heat it up. 
Or we might fuse a piece from the 
spring. Either way it might end up 
jammed for good. It’s too risky.” 

“All right, Viktor.” 

The silence went on and on this 
time— until both Harvey and I got on 
the circuit with a “Sonya, are you all 
right?” 

For the first time there was a real 
note of strain in her voice. “Yes. 
Now stop bothering me.” Harvey 
reacted before I did, using the 
senior-officer voice he only used 
when he wanted to shock something 
out of one of us. 

“Miss Gorchakova, report your 
condition!” 

She was silent for a few seconds, 
then said quietly, “My feet are get- 
ting cold. I am having a little trouble 
getting into position.” 

“Sonya, I think you’d better try 
putting the torch directly on the 
latch. Shut up, Viktor!” Harvey’s 
mind must have been working along 
the same lines as mine. If she lost the 
use of her feet, it might be impos- 
sible for her to crawl back out again. 

“Colonel Harvey.” She took a 
deep breath. “Viktor is the engineer. 
And I am in here. You are not. Let 
me work.” 

She shut off her radio with a sharp 
click. Harvey swore a bit, then shut 
up. I was too edgy to say anything. I 
hunched down, ready to move if 
Sonya called, and waited. I was 
imagining her in there, struggling 



with tools she had trouble lifting on 
Earth, while her body heat flowed 
rapidly out through the suit into the 
minus-eighty temperature now sur- 
rounding her. At least she was out of 
what was left of the wind. 

After about two minutes we heard 
a clanking noise as she picked up 
something, and then a series of 
smaller clanks, clicks, thumps and 
bangs that went on and on and 
seemed to be ready to go on for 
three hours. But it was really only 
about four minutes later when there 
was a single sharp thunk! that jolted 
the whole ship. 

She came back on the circuit with: 
“Latch cleared.” 

As if we needed telling. It sounded 
like more than three people cheering 
from inside. When the noise died 
down, Harvey said: “Okay, Sonya, 
Hank. Get your asses inside and we’ll 
call up Novokov as soon as we have 
AOS and tell him we’re ready to 
initiate countdown. And Sonya— 
thanks.” 

“Nichevo, ” she replied. Maybe it 
really was nothing to her. “My legs 
are a little— stiff. I will have to come 
out slowly, using my hands.” I shift- 
ed position to stretch out my arms as 
far as the space would let me towards 
where she would crawl out of the 
bay. I saw her light begin to jerk and 
waver again as she reversed her posi- 
tion and the hose started twisting. 

She was having a bad time of it. I 
could feel the vibration as she drag- 
ged herself around equipment, the 
lower part of her body a useless 



HER FINE AND PRIVATE PLANET 



119 




weight thumping down hard on each 
move. But it was her breathing that 
really scared me. It was rasping and 
half-choked. She sounded on the 
edge of collapse. 

Suddenly I saw her helmet sil- 
houetted against the light reflected 
from the ceiling. I wriggled forward 
and stretched out my arms until I 
thought they would pop out of their 
sockets. Sonya saw me moving and 
raised her head. 

“Hello, Hank.” 

I giggled softly with relief. Her 
voice had sounded quite normal. 
Then I noticed that her hose had 
become looped around a telemetry 
housing, just a few inches below the 
top. I mentioned it to her and saw 
her nod. She pulled herself around 
and reached out toward it, her back 
arched and her arms at full stretch. 

As she reached out she half-rose 
off one knee. The numb lower leg 
buckled. Overbalancing, she toppled 
forwards. Her head struck the hull 
with a jar I felt clearly and for a split 
second all her weight came down on 
the hoses. The helmet seals had 
become brittle in the cold, like the 
spring. They gave. 

I saw the white cloud as the air 
puffed out of her helmet and yelled 
something incoherent. Sonya tried to 
clasp her hands over the open hole, 
but the air was gone before she could 
do it. I heard her gasp. Then she 
twisted at the waist and fell over on 
her back. Her head smashed down on 
the deck and I saw the faceplate seals 
of her helmet crack. I jammed myself 



as far toward her as I could. It wasn’t 
far enough. Not too much farther 
and possibly I might have grabbed 
her and possibly rigged some sort of 
cross-connection between our hel- 
mets. Two “possibles,” neither of 
them a “probable.” And in any case I 
couldn’t reach her. I didn’t look at 
her face, either— at least not until 
quite a while after she had stopped 
rnoving. 

I stayed fairly calm for the ten 
minutes it took for me to do what I 
wanted to do and climb back 
through the airlock. I didn’t get the 
shakes until I was back in the crew 
compartment . 

. and I didn’t get over them 
until we had broken out of Mars 
orbit and started home. Harvey took 
the Grissom up by himself and made 
rendezvous only three and a half 
hours after liftoff. Dr. Petrova sent 
me to my cabin and it wasn’t until 
we were two hundred thousand kilo- 
meters out that they sat me down 
and asked for the story. Harvey 
argued Novikov out of doing it 
sooner. 

I know they couldn’t understand 
why I did what I did before coming 
inside. After Sonya stopped moving, 
I waited for about three minutes, 
then picked her up and propped her 
in a sitting position, looking out 
through the hatch. It seemed the way 
she ought to be, because until the 
next expedition she does have Mars 
all to herself. Her fine and private 
planet. ★

Poor Sam— he faced the oldest weapon of all! 



A BETTER RAT-TRAP 



CHARLES HOEQUIST and ROBERT PHILLIPS 




S AM 47 crouched low, trying to 
blend his shape into the dune 
curves. 

In the faraway control blockhouse 
Sam’s operator looked at the moni- 
tor screen showing the image relayed 
by the camera in Sam’s left eye- 
socket. She swore softly. 

The cat drifted over the dunes, 
shoulders working smoothly under 
orange-and-white fur. Well-trained, 
alert and deadly, it was a species- 
specific weapon. Sam was the target. 

Sam remained unmoving, awaiting 
orders to move. The controller sat 
very still, perhaps trying to augment 
Sam’s frozen stance. 

Then the cat stopped and both 
Sam and the controller knew that 
Sam had been spotted. 

The controller was good at her 
task, but there were many good 
controllers. She was a better con- 
troller because she knew when to let 
the weapon act on its own. This was 
a typical occasion. 

Slowly the cat turned, crouched, 
tail whipping the salt air. 

The controller shut down the com- 
mand frequencies, leaving only the 
monitoring amplifying system in con- 
tact. 

The cat aligned himself to face 



121 



Sam— a sleek tom bred and trained 
all his life for this eventuality. As 
much as instinct and training could 
induce him to, he hated Sam. He 
existed primarily to kill any rat he 
found. No ordinary rat had a chance 
against him. 

Sam was not an ordinary rat, 
though. Sam 47 was an incredibly 
complex animal-machine gestalt. His 
skeleton had been strengthened with 
aluminum; he was controlled by 
millions of microelectrodes; his every 
bodily function was monitored, as 
was every current in his brain. In 
addition the computer took every 
muscle impulse from the brain and 
amplified it, splitting it into iden- 
tical pulse-orders, one going to the 
muscles and the other going to the 
microcables that multiplied Sam’s 
strength and agility several times 
over. Sam’s stomach had just a few 
hours earlier been replaced by two 
things: a protein sac to keep Sam 
alive long enough to fulfill his 
mission, and a tiny powerful bomb. 

The cat leaped at Sam, hot in- 
stinctive hunting desire augmented 
by artificially induced killer lust. 
But quick as the cat was, Sam was 
infinitely quicker. 

Sam jerked up to his full nine-inch 
height, surveyed the oncoming death 
for an instant, then sprang sideways 
to safety, slashing at the murderous 
feline at the same time. Aluminum 
claws dug thin, shallow slits into the 
cat’s side. The precise arc of the 
feline body disappeared as the star- 
tled cat flailed into the sand with a 



scream of surprise and rage— no in- 
tended victim had ever reacted as had 
Sam. 

Before the cat had any chance to 
reorient himself Sam was streaking 
the offensive. With his capabilities, 
he could have met the enemy head- 
on and won; but every scratch re- 
ceived, no matter how small, was a 
drain on energy and efficiency. It 
was better to use finesse. At this 
point, the controller could only hope 
that Sam’s injury-aversive condition- 
ing would hold. 

S AM rifled directly at the feline. 

At an instant that seemed much 
too late to avoid raking claws he 
swerved, zigzagging out to the cat’s 
side in a spray of sand— then in under 
the white-furred belly. Sam’s op- 
ponent had good reflexes, excellent 
reflexes, but against the equipment 
that, through radio communications, 
formed a vital part of Sam’s volun- 
tary muscular control any other set 
of reactions in the animal kingdom 
were pitifully slow and inadequate. 
The cat was only just realizing that 
this strange new rat had changed 
direction when Sam unleashed a 
burst of aluminum fury of one hind 
leg, then scurried out of range of the 
frantically thrashing cat. When he 
had gone several meters, Sam whirled 
about to face an enemy that now 
regarded him from a shaky three- 
legged stance. 

At this point, the cat was, in his 
own fuzzy cat-way, frightened and 



122 



GALAXY 




confused. He was confused because 
of the strange little hated target that 
was everywhere at once. ‘He was 
frightened because he had been hurt. 
Badly hurt. More than ever he 
wanted to rip Sam apart. He also 
realized that the feat was not within 
his abilities. So, planning in an indis- 
tinct way to catch Sam off-guard 
later, he started slowly, cautiously, 
to move away. It was a serious error. 

The instant Sam sensed his foe’s 
attempt to break off, the betrayal of 
weakness, he moved in. The cat 
barely had time to recognize the fact 
of Sam’s renewed attack before Sam 
changed tactics. 

Sam jumped. A short, high arc, 
giving the cat ample time to look up 
and try to rise on both hind legs 
to fight. The damaged leg gave way 
immediately, dropping the cat on the 
sand, belly-up. 

Sam’s controller realized what 
Sam was doing— it took a conscious 
effort on her part to keep from 
forcing Sam to break off the fight. 
She had allowed Sam free rein and he 
was undoubtedly going to sustain 
some injuries in this close combat. If 
she tried to pull him away now— 
against his powerful fighting instinct, 
the conflict would probably only 
confuse Sam, jumble his coordi- 
nation and give his enemy the 
upper hand. 

Sam had lost all contact with 
reality— his universe was centered on 
a point precisely under his claws and 
he raked at that point, tore at it, 
ripped it with aluminum fangs, 



mangled fur and flesh, ignoring other 
claws that scored his back. 

But the controller couldn’t ignore 
those claws. The monitors indicated 
a certain loss of efficiency due to 
wounds already received— the damage 
was not yet critical, but that was no 
reason to take chances. 

The controller waited a fraction of 
a second, making sure that the cat 
was too panicked and weakened to 
counterattack when Sam broke off. 
Then she resumed command of the 
frenzied rat. 

Sam jerked up, then sprang away 
from his victim, contorting wildly, 
trying to get at the pain racing along 
his back and sides as the amplifying 
systems forced awareness of pain 
into his brain. 

Nervously the controller studied 
the systems indicators; Sam’s blind 
rage was breaking up, slowly fading 
away from the cat and recentering on 
the heightened pain sense. She 
shifted temporary command to the 
computer— it had been programed for 
this contingency. With a thorough 
knowledge of Sam’s reactions and 
psychology, it progressively de-ampli- 
fied the pain signals, and then began 
to blank them out of Sam’s brain, 
calming him down. The end result 
was a placid Sam, unaware of his 
injuries, squatting on the sand and 
watching the cat feebly try to paw its 
entrails back into a mangled ab- 
dominal cavity. 

The controller stared at the screen 
for several seconds. She owned a 
cat of her own . 



A BETTER RAT-TRAP 



123 




S TERNLY she broke off the com- 
puter command circuit and re- 
sumed personal control. Sam began 
trotting across the sand, swinging his 
head slowly from side to side to relay 
a better view of the terrain. 

The controller was monitoring 
Sam with an intensity reserved only 
for this stage of the mission— she 
controlled Sam’s behavior with fan- 
tastic precision for the same reason. 
Now Sam was entering a zone in 
which the danger was not from other 
animals— they were something Sam 
could deal with-but from a thick 
blanket of electronic detect-and- 
destroy devices, set up by the Ameri- 
cans when they realized the danger 
from Sam’s predecessors. 

Suddenly a thought struck the 
controller and she queried the com- 
puter: what was Sam’s present op- 
erating efficiency and projected in- 
dex at the point of the mission’s final 
state— assuming no further interrup- 
tions? 

The computer mulled over the 
question and answered it in less than 
measurable time: present efficiency 
overall, 79 % of highest possible 
physical capabilities, assuming all fac- 
tors totally favorable at time of 
standard measurement; projected ef- 
ficiency overall at final stage, 70% of 
etc. The controller glanced at the 
tape, tossed it aside and forgot about 
it. Better not to worry about 
something that was not critical — 
there were plenty of problems that 
might become so. 

A dog patrolling the dunes came 



upon the cat’s body. Carefully, he 
clamped it in his jaws and carried it 
to his master’s lookout post. 

Sam and the controller now 
worked virtually as a single entity— 
the controller’s mind in Sam’s body. 
A faint smile of relief played over her 
features as she guided Sam through 
mine fields, low-profile scanning 
units, sound analyzers— so far, the 
data gathered by the previous ani- 
mals in the Sam series seemed to be 
adequate. Apparently the Americans 
had nothing new. 

The controller had to curb her 
impatience as Sam progressed— it was 
a great temptation to abandon cau- 
tion, to send Sam racing through the 
Americans’ defenses. It irked her 
slightly that she could not yet see 
Sam’s objective, due to the limited 
focusing ability of the microlens in 
Sam’s eyesocket. With every step 
Sam took she relaxed a bit. Sam was 
sure to succeed— he couldn’t fail this 
far into the mission. 

Sam suddenly began to limp— a leg 
damaged in the fight was beginning 
to give under the demands put on it. 
The controller lowered the pain-in- 
hibition in Sam’s brain, causing him 
to favor the leg, saving it from 
further injury. The controller 
checked with the computer again on 
Sam’s Efficiency : present, 77%; pro- 
jected at final state, still 70%. 

At Security headquarters, the cat’s 
corpse was studied closely. Grim 
officers checked the electronic 
killers, rechecked, checked their 
monitors. By simply refusing to be 



124 



GALAXY 




found, Sam was unconsciously wag- 
ing a war of nerves on the Ameri- 
cans. 

Occasionally Sam would lift his 
eyes. The lens in his left socket 
would slowly screw out, as the con- 
troller again tried to see the purpose 
for Sam’s existence. It was still too 
far away. Sam lowered his head again 
and continued across the dunes. 

Security jeeps sprinted across the 
concrete plain, erupting out of their 
low blockhouses -An each the passen- 
ger was holding tightly to a weapon. 
The weapon stank. 

Sam peered at the far horizon 
once again. The controller looked at 
the screen and a sunrise of content- 
ment rose into her face. 

There it was. The rocket. 

As yet, the camera could just 
barely focus on it— it was a thin 
finger, pointing up from the bottom 
of the meter-wide screen. But it was 
there. Destroy it and the Americans 
would be set back crucial weeks. Sam 
could do it and by doing so prove the 
value of the project that had 
spawned him. 

Sam’s controller increased his pace 
slightly; he looked ahead more fre- 
quently now, and the rocket’s image 
grew from a finger’s height on the 
monitor to twice that, and twice 
that. 

Slowly, in careful stages, the con- 
troller began to relax. Soon it would 
be over. Once she finished maneu- 
vering Sam out of the danger zone, 
his training could take over. The 
operation was to be successful, 



then— well and good. She had known 
it would be. She knew Sam, knew his 
capacities. Certainly he could be 
hindered— after all, he was only a 
rat— but stopped? 

No. 

Sam stopped. 

T O THE controller the halt came 
almost as a physical jolt. Sam 
simply froze, without any orders. 
Slowly she ran checks over all of 
Sam’s sensory monitors, concen- 
trating hard to fight back an odd 
feeling of disorientation in her mind, 
which she recognized as a prelude to 
panic. 

Sight: nothing dangerous. Smell: 
again a negative. Tactile . 

A wire. Sam could feel it, a 
sharply delineated pressure on his 
chest. Then came the sound. 

Now hyperalert, the controller 
seized on the auditory response in- 
stantly and investigated it. Obviously 
it was nothing deadly or Sam would 
have acted on his own— but then, did 
Sam know every noise that could 
mean danger? 

Sam angled his head left, to look 
at whatever made the hissings, the 
scrapings. Dogs? Cats? Men? 

Sam looked with one eye and the 
controller looked with the other. 
Guns looked back at them, muzzles 
instead of eyes, looking at Sam. 

For an instant the controller 
stared at the screen, puzzled. Then 
Sam’s predicament crashed into her 
awareness. Her flash of insight was 
followed immediately by a rush of 



A BETTER RAT-TRAP 



125 




panic. Sam couldn’t be stopped now! 
Her life was dependent on his at this 
point— Sam’s death prior to mission 
fulfillment would seal her own fate. 
Sam must survive, must escape, must 
complete his assignment. 

She felt linked to Sam as never 
before. Slowly her panic drained 
away— but it left a stain of despera- 
tion on her thoughts, slowing down 
her mind, clogging up idea channels. 

For years the controller had suc- 
cessfully practiced rigid emotional 
control— she had, in fact, succeeded 
so well that a part of her was totally 
amazed when she began crying. 

The jeeps had dispersed around 
the rocket, Sam s target. Each jeep 's 
passenger took the weapon he held 
and placed it on the concrete. All the 
jeeps departed, leaving the stinking 
weapons around the rocket. 

Trapped, the controller’s mind ran 
in tight circles, over and over, me- 
chanically, reviewing again and again 
what she had realized in that cruel 
burst of insight. 

The Americans had been clever. 
Considering the pitifully small 
amount of data they had on the Sam 
animals, to have stopped Sam 47 was 
a fantastic achievement. And Sam 
was very thoroughly halted. When his 
body had pressed against the trip 
wire, weaponry had been alerted to 
Sam’s location. A normal animal 
would have stepped over the wire, 
releasing the pressure— and quite 
probably activating the guns. Sam, 
of course, stopped, held prisoner, to 
be found, perhaps even captured. 



From habit, the controller 
checked Sam’s operating capacity 
again: present, 76%; projected, 68%. 
Unless she accomplished something 
soon, it would be too late. 

The Americans ’ electronic devices 
noted that something had been acti- 
vating a section of wire entirely too 
long. It passed the information on to 
its masters. 

W ITH agonizing slowness Sam’s 
controller forced herself to 
think. The problem was quite well 
defined and she held as axiomatic 
that the existence of a problem 
proved the existence of the prob- 
lem’s solution— it was just a matter of 
finding that solution. Grimly the 
controller began the search. 

First, directly ahead were only 
sand, grass, concrete and the rocket. 

Next, to the right lay sand, scrub, 
asphalt, the Americans’ anti-Sam net. 
To the left-more of the same. 
Carefully, keeping pressure on the 
wire, Sam turned to look back: 
again, the same. But something was 
nagging at the controller. There had 
to be an answer somewhere in all 
this. She began studying every piece 
of defensive armament on the moni- 
tor screen. 

The soldiers, with their dogs, were 
starting their search along the wire, 
but there was a lot of wire and only 
only one Sam. 

Cautiously the controller began 
tracing patterns from her observa- 
tions, searching alertly for something 
to aid Sam. Then, building up in her 



126 



GALAXY 




consciousness, came the data she 
needed: the guns. 

After looking at as many as she 
could see, the controller reached the 
firm conclusion that only those with- 
in a definite radius of Sam had 
moved to sight on the rodent. In 
addition, the guns were not all aimed 
precisely at Sam— as far as she could 
tell, the intention was to saturate a 
certain area. And if there were boun- 
daries to such areas, then it followed 
that there had to be a differentiation 
between sections of wire. 

With new purpose, the controller 
directed Sam to begin looking to 
each side again. The controller 
studied the monitor intensely, and 
soon found what she sought: to 
Sam’s left, a black post approxi- 
mately a meter tall served no obvious 
function except to hold up the wire, 
which probably ran directly into the 
post, though the wire was too thin 
and the camera’s resolution inade- 
quate to tell. 

This, then, might be the solution. 
Assuming that the post indeed con- 
trolled the actions of the guns, it 
would be by direct connection— the 
guns weren’t equipped for radio re- 
ception by the looks of them. 
Assume next that the control cables 
were close to the surface, where Sam 
could get at them without leaving the 
wire. And finally— and here was the 
weakest link— assume that Sam had 
cut off a flow of current and that a 
resumption of that current would 
fire the guns. This last point was pure 
conjecture. 



Leaning against the wire, Sam 
made his way to the black post and 
began digging around the base. For a 
minute, sand spewed in a gritty cloud 
from his claws. Suddenly he stopped. 
His head twitched up, giving the 
controller a view of whatever it was 
that Sam had heard. She gave a 
moment to fuming about bioengi- 
neers who couldn’t fit both a camera 
and a mike into Sam, leaving her 
with only the means of knowing that 
Sam had heard something, with no 
way of finding out what it was, short 
of seeing it. 

Sam saw it. From the bad picture 
on the monitor the controller judged 
the moving figures, man and dog, to 
be at least four hundred meters 
away. Then Sam went back to his 
digging, more hurriedly now and 
without spraying so much sand— the 
controller kept him working when 
liis instinct told him to flee. 

ANOTHER minute of digging and 
the controller began to worry 
about her hypothesis. She directed 
Sam to dig in one spot only, hoping 
that the Americans had run a line to 
the guns over the shortest distance 
possible. Now, more and more, she 
was operating on guesswork. She 
didn’t know how fast the soldier and 
the patrol dog were coming— or even 
if they were continuing in Sam’s 
direction. There was little logical 
reason to believe that the control 
cable would be buried within Sam’s 
reach. Her worst uncertainty was: 



A BETTER RAT-TRAP 



127 




were the guns signaled by a current 
or no-current? 

Hearing what the controller diag- 
nosed as barking, Sam snapped up his 
furry head to look again at the 
soldier and the dog. The controller 
turned Sam’s attention back to his 
digging. She could see that the pair 
had closed to three hundred meters, 
perhaps a bit less— time became a 
vital factor at this point. 

Automatically the controller 
checked Sam’s index: present, 70%; 
projected, 61%. She was mulling over 
these low figures when Sam found 
the cable. 

His claws had raked across the 
sheathing and Sam stopped, his ob- 
jective discovered. But the discovery 
brought with it a tricky problem : the 
sheathing remained unmarked— 
obviously Sam couldn’t snap the 
cable with his claws and it was too 
far away to reach with his teeth. 

The controller was not about to be 
stopped. She and Sam were, for all 
purposes, one entity again, as the 
controller lifted Sam’s left hind leg 
to shove against the wire while Sam 
inched a bit farther forward— for- 
ward— forward . 

Sam’s nose reached the cable, ad-/ 
vanced farther, to bring the jaws to 
bear. Sam’s auditory monitor picked 
up sharp impulses— barking again. 
The controller forced herself not to 
think of the consequences of chance 
going against her. 

Sam’s incisors bit into the cable, 
nibbled, gnawed— and snapped the 
cable. 



No reaction. Sam wasn’t ripped 
apart by high-velocity bullets. The 
gamble had succeeded. 

Sam shot over the wire at full 
speed, racing toward the rocket, vic- 
torious. He was but three hundred 
meters from his target, oblivious to 
everything but the rocket, his objec- 
tive. Outside Sam’s universe the 
guard dog went wild on his leash and 
was released to streak across the 
concrete after Sam, but it was hope- 
less. Even with an injured leg Sam 
was faster. 

Tension and fear ebbed away from 
the controller as Sam approached to 
within two hundred meters of the 
rocket. There was no way to hold 
Sam back now. Within seconds he 
would be scurrying up the gantry 
tower, attacking vital wiring, ruining 
certain delicate and acessible com- 
ponents and finally positioning him- 
self in a strategic position to be 
detonated. 

Sam was one hundred fifty meters 
away from the rocket’s base and 
starting to slow down. 

After releasing his dog, the soldier 
had radioed Security. Now a swarm 
of vehicles raced across the concrete, 
toward Sam, the rocket and the 
stinking weapons. 

With a jolt, the controller noted 
Sam’s slackening pace and was im- 
mediately alert; was Sam’s hurt leg 
finally giving out? No, the only 
unusual reading was on the olfactory 
monitor, but it was powerful and was 
affecting Sam oddly. His instinctive 
areas were in great agitation— the 



128 



GALAXY 




cerebral command area was being 
suppressed. The controller stepped 
up the power on the command fre- 
quency as much as possible without 
damaging the relay satellite’s cir- 
cuitry; but Sam did not increase his 
speed. It baffled the controller com- 
pletely. 

Suddenly it was over. Ignoring the 
commands ringing in his tiny brain, 
Sam changed direction as the stink- 
ing weapons took effect. The con- 
troller did everything in her power to 
make him head around to the rocket, 
but to no avail. Under her electronic 
battering Sam reeled, staggered, 
jerked and leaped, but kept on 
doggedly toward his goal. 

It was with another flash of pain- 
ful insight that the controller realized 
that the situation had become hope- 
less. Everything she had done so far, 
all the agonizing, the joy— all was 
meaningless, all for nothing. 

She felt no bitterness— the time 
was past for that. Her fate was very 
close. 

With precise motions she armed 
Sam and detonated him. Then she sat 
back, released, to think of pleasant 
things, to remember good days, until 
her arrest and execution. 

S AM’S death shattered concrete 
and made a sound heard more 
than a mile away, scattering the 
rat over a five-meter radius. 

In seconds the cars were there, the 
jeeps and the trucks. This was not 
Security’s moment and the agents 
stayed back. Now the technicians 



came, antiseptic men to scrape Sam 
off the concrete. 

A limousine rolled up to the scene, 
disgorging a general and two more 
antiseptics. All three walked to the 
scorched patch that signaled blast 
center. They stood looking at the 
seared concrete for a moment. Then 
a whitecoat reached down to the 
steaming film of homogenized rat 
and picked up a skull fragment. An 
aluminum tooth still dangled loosely 
from it. 

“I don’t believe it,” he said, star- 
ing at the bone chunk. “This thing is 
supposed to be back on the perim- 
eter wire, according to our de- 
tectors.” 

The other tech shrugged. “It’s 
beaten all our defenses. Looks like 
another modified rat. A damn good 
one, too, to get through everything 
we put out.” 

“But it didn’t get through,” the 
general pointed out. “Your people 
stopped it.” 

“We were lucky,” answered the 
first whitecoat, dropping the skull 
fragment. “I’m not sure that we can 
do it again.” 

“Fantastically clever, though, to 
appeal to the thing’s most basic 
urge— say, let’s get out of here. That 
smell’s giving me a headache.” 

The three men departed, as the 
Security guards moved in. They be- 
gan collecting the weapons that had 
stopped Sam 47, super-rat: caged 
female rats in heat induced by 
synthetic harmones— and reeking of 
artificially fortified musk. *

JAMES WHITE 



WHA T HAS GONE BEFORE 

JOHN DEVLIN is awakened from 
cold sleep by ship’s computerized 
system and told he’s seventy-five 
years into mission: man’s first at- 
tempt to colonize a star system other 
than his own. He is computer-in- 
structed to check ship’s systems, 
then his own voluntary /involuntary 
bodily functions, circulation, senso- 
rium, speech organ and memory. His 
period of awakening is for one hour. 
During this time he is to speak, 
exercise and try to remember his 
cold-sleep dream. In his dream he 
was a primitive, ocean-dwelling life 
form, inordinately hungry -and was 
himself eaten by a carnivorous cepha- 
lopod while eating a trilobite. 

His second awakening comes 282 
years into mission. His instructions 
are as before, but in addition he’s 
told to go to the ship ’s control center 
to evaluate target system three. The 
ship’s computer had bypassed the 
first two target star systems as un- 
suitable for human colonization. 



Number 3 is a perfect, Earth-type 
planet, unpolluted and verdant-but 
is entering Roche’s limit and will 
soon break up to become a ring 
system around its primary . DEVLIN 
rules no landing, obediently remem- 
bers last cold-sleep dream: in it he 
was an enormous brontosaurus and 
was killed by a small, carnivorous 
allosaurus. 

On his next awakening-323 years 
into mission-he is told to check a 
malfunction in Blue 31, a colonist 
cubicle, and discovers Colonist 
YVONNE CALDWELL, 18 biologi- 
cal years old, improperly frozen and 
dying. At the end of her last waking 
period she had tried to communicate 
with her boy friend, also a colonist, 
and had not made it to her cold-sleep 
casket in time. DEVLIN makes her 
death as comfortable as he can. 
Before returning to cold sleep he is 
required to remember a complete 
day in his life prior to starting on 
mission. 

He had been a physician and re- 
members three instances of violence 
he had attended on an Earth made 
uninhabitable by its inhabitants: 1) a 
young man wounded as a bystander 
in a duel between his father and 
father-in-law; 2) a lovely young girl, 
PATRICIA MORLEY, who had dis- 
figured her face to discourage mur- 
derous duels between her suitors; 3) 
a dead boy, victim of a chance bullet 
fired during riot in another part of 
town. During the same day he also 
meets a rather mysterious man 
known as BROTHER HOWARD. 

DEVLIN’s fourth awakening is for 
the purpose of evaluating another 
possibly habitable star system. The 
system is already inhabited -by 



131 




technologically advanced aliens who 
have polluted it and send spacecraft 
to destroy DEVLIN’s ship. He per- 
forms evasive action. 

Before being permitted to return 
to cold sleep DEVLIN is instructed 
to remember another episode of past 
life. He chooses his first date with 
PATRICIA MORLEY, which 
BROTHER HOWARD intercepted to 
recruit both DEVLIN and PAT- 
RICIA as starship crew. They pass 
psychiatric testing by HOWARD’S 
associate, psychologist Dr. MARTIN. 
Cooldown follows and this time 
DEVLIN dreams he’s a medieval 
prince who grows up to be king and 
wage successful war on a neighbor 
kingdom. He marries his vanquished 
foe’s daughter, who detests him and, 
after giving him two sons, causes him 
to be assassinated. 

DEVLIN’S next awakening is 603 
years into mission. He’s told to re- 
member pre-launch instruction and 
dreams, is startled at the totality of 
his recall of every thing -including 
terrifying cold-sleep nightmares. He 
also discovers another dead colonist, 
identifies him as THOMAS PURDY. 
The discovery delays his return to 
sleep casket and computer wakes 
PATRICIA MORLEY to see what 
the trouble is. 

DEVLIN and PATRICIA decide 
that PURDY had in effect commit- 
ted suicide to escape cold-sleep 
dreams-they also experience despe- 
rate fatigue, decide to override com- 
puter and try natural sleep to re- 
cover. Results are so gratifying that 
they program computer to instruct 
all those on board to try normal 
sleep breaks to lick cold-sleep night- 
mares. 



Before returning to cold sleep 
DEVLIN recalls the moment when 
he had discovered, during training for 
this mission, that BROTHER HO- 
WARD had once been a stellar astro- 
naut, one of the first to experiment 
with hibernation anesthesia in 
space -a legendary figure. 

XXII 

T HE dream began very badly with 
a long and rapid succession of 
deaths. Like an endless deck of play- 
ing cards dealt face upward, they 
were presented briefly and with all 
the details clear before being re- 
placed by another face of death with 
a greater or smaller value of fear, 
violence or pain. 

There was a card for the bronto- 
saurus and the trilobite and the 
cave-dweller and the old king and 
many, many others he had not ex- 
perienced before. There was the in- 
stant barbecue of the old school- 
teacher, the drunken agony of the 
salesman spitted on his car’s steering 
column, the frantic coughing of the 
soldier drowning in the blood from 
his throat wound and the airliner 
pilot who had his third cervical ver- 
tebra and a large section of his lower 
jaw blasted away by a hijacker’s 
bullet. 

Some of the deaths were much 
worse than the others and a few were 
almost pleasant. These were the slow, 
comfortable deaths from wasting 
diseases or exposure when the break- 
down of circulation brought drowsi- 
ness and a feeling of warmth. But 
even those cards, although free of the 
symbols of violence and pain, were 
often stamped with the dark and 



132 



GALAXY 




dreadful markings of fear of death 
itself and of what might come after. 

Only gradually did he become 
aware that he was able to make 
comparisons between these terrible 
or merely unpleasant deaths and, 
much later, that he was an individual 
called Devlin who suffered it all but 
was at the same time detached from 
everything that was happening to 
him. 

Devlin did not know how long it 
was and how often he died before he 
discovered that he could exercise a 
small measure of control over the 
process. 

He began by trying to hold on to 
the less unpleasant dyings for as long 
as possible— those comparatively 
painless or those that had pain asso- 
ciated with them but where the fear 
of death was absent or of secondary 
importance because of anxiety for or 
pleasant memories of loved ones. 
Then he learned how to push away 
from the death instants, to go farther 
and farther back in time into the 
period preceding the continual and 
fearfully detailed dyings. 

The deaths were not banished or 
forgotten— they were still the most 
intense and painful episodes in the 
dream lives. But now he could be 
selective, he could tune for the less 
savage and painful experiences lead- 
ing up to death in the hope of going 
even farther back to times when he 
had known only life and pleasure 
instead of death and pain. 

A few of the cards Devlin had 
already seen, but very briefly . 

He was a good salesman and 
always had been since he had 
joined the organization at the age 

THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



of twenty-two. Section heads, 
supervisors and sales directors of 
increasing seniority had com- 
mended him for his youthful en- 
thusiasm and complete faith in 
the product of the moment. He 
had always given every sales pitch 
everything he had, and he had had 
a lot to give. 

Offers of promotion had come 
early, but less and less often. 
Customers were so much wax in 
his hands, but for some reason he 
was unable to inspire fellow sales- 
men to anything like his own 
enthusiasm. They were a cynical 
bunch, in general, who refused to 
share in his act of faith in the 
company and its product. So he 
was given selling assignments of 
increasing importance because, it 
was said, his talents should not be 
wasted on a purely supervisory 
job, and his commissions and ex- 
pense accounts were the envy of 
all except his mother. 

She did not like the way he 
worried about his work at night— 
that was in the early days, of 
course, when he spent most of his 
spare time at home. She was also 
fond of telling him that he did not 
have to be successful at everything 
to be happy, that she had stopped 
being taken in by his sales pitch 
shortly after his tenth birthday 
and that if his father had been 
alive he would have told him to 
change his job. 

Talk about his father always 
made him uncomfortable because 
her voice reminded him, just a 
little, of the tone he used while 
referring to his merchandise. 
When his father had died he had 

133 




been too young to feel any sense 
of loss or grief, and the pictures 
he had seen of his parent had 
shown a pretty average person— 
the kind who could be talked into 
buying anything. 

But somehow this colorless in- 
dividual had sold himself to his 
mother so successfully that, even 
twenty years after his death, she 
remained faithful to the original 
product to such an extent that 
talking about him made her al- 
most happy. He had never been 
able to understand how his father 
had been able to achieve this 
effect, but the reason was proba- 
bly that he himself had been 
unwilling to spend the time and 
effort necessary for such a long- 
term sales project as marriage. 

But then a good salesman did 
not need to be married to get a 
girl. 

Nowadays he could not get girls 
so easily and sometimes not at all. 
His boyish enthusiasm did not sit 
well on a face whose red-veined 
nose and deep etched wrinkles 
were anything but boyish . He had 
almost lost today’s client despite 
the half bottle he had killed at 
breakfast to fortify himself for 
the fray. 

It has been a tough fight at 
that, lasting most of the morning 
and through a three-hour working 
lunch, and he had won it by sheer, 
dogged persistence that had been 
close to desperation. Having won 
he had celebrated, mostly because 
he liked celebrating and to dismiss 
any lingering self-doubts troubling 
him. His desperation had not, he 
was sure, been apparent to the 



client, and the sale had not been 
won because the client had felt 
sorry for him. He would continue 
the celebration as soon as he got 
back to his hotel. 

He was into the parked truck 
with its muddied rear lights so 
suddenly that he had only time to 
desperately swerve his steering. 

A fast, relaxed and accurate 
driver, he was fond of telling 
people, had no need of a safety 
belt. Instead of burrowing under 
the truck’s overhang and hitting 
the differential he ran into the 
tires of the enormous double 
wheels, and he did not bounce 
because he was stuck fast on the 
steering column . 

And another familiar card came 
u P : 

The large, cold drops of rain 
slapped at the canvas cover with a 
sound like distant gunfire and the 
vehicle’s slow lurching progress 
along the dark street made his 
head roll from side to side and 
allowed the droplets running 
down his face to collect inside his 
collar. Facing forward, his elbows 
hooked over the support rail and, 
his weapon at the ready, all he 
could see was a stretch of shining 
black road surface pitted and 
wrinkled by past petrol bombs 
and carpeted with half-bricks, 
broken bottles and pieces of 
smashed pavement. The houses on 
each side of him moved past, their 
downstairs windows glowing or 
flickering as interior lights or a TV 
screen’s glow tried to fight its way 
through the heavy drapes, while 



134 



GALAXY 




the dripping hedges and front 
garden, some shaggy and some 
neat, could have been hiding any- 
thing. 

He felt too cold and wet and 
miserable, he realized suddenly, to 
have any room left for fear. No 
terrorist, he was sure, would risk 
pneumonia by setting up an am- 
bush under these conditions. They 
would probably be watching tele- 
vision like normal people— 
especially the news coverage of 
their shootings and bombings or 
the mouthings of the pundits dis- 
cussing the possible political rami- 
fications of the latest blast. Or 
they might be plotting around the 
fireside or up in a bedroom with 
their wives or girl friends, engaged 
in seduction rather than sedition. 
Which made him wonder if the 
women concerned were bothered 
by the fact that the hands caress- 
ing them had, a few hours or days 
earlier, been responsible for killing 
one of his mates or an uncom- 
mitted civilian with a bomb or a 
rifle or a rocket launcher. He 
wondered if— sometime during 
this tour of duty— he killed some- 
one he would be foolish enough 
to tell her about it. The circum- 
stances were completely different, 
of course, but when he got on to 
this particularly uncomfortable 
line of thought he sometimes 
wondered if he had the wrong job. 

Tonight he was so cold and 
miserable he knew he was in the 
wrong job. 

The unlighted or heavily cur- 
tained windows paraded past. 
Sometimes he imagined that the 
curtains moved or that the vene- 

THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



tian blinds twitched. Possibly 
there was a gunman drawing a 
bead on him, or a terrorist sympa- 
thizer keeping him under observa- 
tion— or he was being watched by 
a curious youngster who couldn’t 
sleep. The rain was beginning to 
trickle down his back. 

He was rounding a curve in the 
street and passing under a lamp- 
post when the firing started— a 
couple of rifles, it sounded like, 
and a Thompson to make him 
keep his head down while the 
sharpshooters tried to pick him 
off. He was out of the vehicle and 
flat on the ground with the others 
before he actually thought about 
doing anything— a reaction, the 
corporal was fond of saying, that 
demonstrated the trained reflexes 
of the professional soldier— while 
the bullets whanged off the body- 
work or punched holes through it. 
He rolled through a shallow 
puddle until he was partly under a 
garden hedge. The noise made it 
hard to think. Despite the heavy 
terrorist fire he could not spot 
any of the flashes from his posi- 
tion. Suddenly his foot was 
gripped and shaken roughly. 

“Get that damned light!” said 
the corporal. “We’ll cover you.” 

He rolled away from the hedge 
and onto his back, took careful 
aim at the center of the fluore- 
scent lamp and did as he had been 
told, losing what remained of his 
night vision in the process. He 
blinked rain out of his eyes and 
returned to the shelter of the 
hedge again as the shooting be- 
came less accurate and began to 
die away. He could hear the whine 

135 




of a couple of heavy APCs tearing 
along the street which paralleled 
this one, trying to cut off the 
gunmen’s retreat. Beside him 
someone loosed off a shot, but all 
he could see were the floating 
green blotches left by the street 
lamp. 

The hedge was not an effective 
shelter. Not only did it allow 
bullets to whip past unimpeded, 
its leaves saved up the rain and 
dropped it on him in small, irregu- 
lar torrents. But the dripping 
hedge reminded him of another 
wet evening many years ago and 
he decided that he could tell Jean 
about this evening because she 
would enjoy the joke. 

Long before they had been 
married there had been another 
hedge in a-very secluded spot near 
the road where Jean lived. The 
first couple of times he had been 
out with her they had not stopped 
at the place, but on the third 
occasion it had been Jean’s birth- 
day and he had put a lot of 
thought and effort into showing 
her a good time and they had 
stopped. A few minutes later the 
great granddaddy of all cloud- 
bursts not only dampened their 
ardor but washed out his main 
plan of attack. 

There had been other secluded 
spots and hedges when his stra- 
tegy had gone very well and the 
final assaults had met only token 
resistance. And after every one of 
them they had always remem- 
bered and laughed over that first 
wet hedge. Now David was four 
years old and there was a boy or a 
girl at minus two months, and 



they could not make up their 
minds which they really wanted. 
It was a very permissive society, 
these days, and it seemed to be 
getting sick and violent with its 
freedoms. He had enjoyed the 
permissiveness, but for a girl-child 
growing up his world might not be 
so good. Parents of girls had a lot 
to worry about. 

The bullet ricocheted off the 
curb and tore a large uneven hole 
through his neck, rupturing the 
left carotid and opening a passage 
into the trachea. The sudden, 
burning pain made him want to 
scream, but when he drew in his 
breath a thick, bloody froth 
flooded into his lungs, strangling 
him. He grabbed at his throat with 
both hands, coughing to clear the 
obstruction, and felt air and warm 
bubbles squeezing between his 
fingers from the entrance and exit 
wounds, but when he tried to 
breathe in there was no air, only 
the warm spurting wetness. 

Very soon he was dead. But not 
nearly soon enough . 

Another life card. 

“Airfield Two. This is Golf 
Alpha November Mike Zulu,” he 
said in quiet fury. “I am ap- 
proaching the coast on a bearing 
of two-eight-seven at flight level 
seven-five-zero. Landing instruc- 
tions, please.” 

“Mike Zulu, Airfield Two. Re- 
main on present heading. Reduce 
to flight level six zero. You have 
twenty-eight miles to run to 
touchdown. Visibility is ten miles. 
Wind gusting to twenty knots. 



136 



GALAXY 




Request aircraft type and passen- 
ger details. ” 

The voice was devoid of emo- 
tion, the diction was good and 
there was no indication that the 
man was gloating. 

“Nimbus Five Transonic,” he 
said. “Seventy-five per cent load. 
Six hundred and twelve adults, 
fifteen children plus crew.” 

A Nimbus yet! The only suit- 
able runway is zero four. It is 
barely long enough and a bit 
rough and you will have an eighty 
degree crosswind port side . We 
suggest you divert. ” 

Before he couid reply the edge 
of a very hard hand was rubbed 
painfully along the side of his 
neck, and the man standing be- 
hind him said, “No.” 

“I have been requested to land 
at Two,” he said. 

“Understood. But remind your 
friends that we have a profit-shar- 
ing arrangement with the other 
two airfields , and if you crash that 
aircraft there will be nothing or 
nobody to ransom. ” 

The hand rubbed his neck even 
harder. 

“My friends are impatient as 
well as greedy,” he said. “A diver- 
sion is not possible.” 

“Your funeral. Reduce flight 
level to five zero. Maintain present 
heading. ” 

“Five zero on present heading,” 
he said, then furiously to the man 
behind him: “I don’t give a damn 
if you commit suicide, but there 
are others involved.” 

The man behind him laughed 
softly, then asked, “Can your 
copilot land this thing?” 

THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



He wanted to say, No, because 
it was the truth and his second 
officer knew that as well as he 
did— but being young and inexper- 
ienced was something that hap- 
pened to everyone at some stage. 
Instead he said quietly, “In these 
conditions we will both be re- 
quired to land this thing. You 
must understand that these super- 
sonic jobs have to put down an 
awful lot of flap to slow us 
sufficiently for a landing. And 
during the last half-minute we will 
be holding on to the sky with our 
fingernails in an attitude that is 
dangerous if the wind velocity and 
direction are not right. With gust- 
ing conditions and maximum flap 
we could fall out of the sky or the 
ground effect could—” 

The edge of the hijacker’s hand 
struck the side of his head just 
above the ear. It was not a hard 
blow, not painful, but it was a 
conversation stopper. 

For the next few minutes he 
maintained an angry and helpless 
silence. This had been no ordinary 
hijack operation or the security 
guards— traveling incognito even 
to the crew, and numbering one 
to every fifty passengers— would 
have been able to stamp on it. The 
disguised guards had picked up 
their weapons inside the aircraft 
and the loading tube detection 
system would have ensured that 
nobody else carried a weapon on 
board. He was still not sure of 
what had happened exactly, but 
his senior hostess had been able to 
reach the flight deck and tell him 
something about it during the 
minute or so before the man 

137 




behind him had arrived and 
broken her back. 

Apparently the hijackers had 
staged an incident during which 
one of their number caused a 
near-panic in his immediate area 
by producing a shaver with a 
black plastic casing that looked 
like a weapon. This has caused 
two of the guards in the vicinity 
to break cover and several others 
to tense up sufficiently for them, 
also, to be spotted. During the 
milling around that followed, hi- 
jackers had disarmed these guards 
using killer-karate. Not all of them 
had been successful, but enough 
of them had been able to get 
weapons to shoot it out with the 
remaining guards who had, of 
course, been hampered through 
trying to avoid hitting innocent 
passengers. 

During the ten-minute gun 
battle the great tubular barn that 
was the main passenger cabin had 
suffered a sharp pressure drop. 
But as all of the guards, four 
hijackers and seventeen others had 
died the remaining passengers 
thought themselves lucky to have 
only bleeding noses and earache. 
He still did not know why his 
senior hostess had had to die 
simply for giving him a situation 
report. 

He liked to understand people 
even if he did not agree with their 
point of view, and he knew some 
of the reasons why this intelligent, 
highly -trained and resourceful 
team of hijackers had taken his 
aircraft. But the senseless display 
of violence in killing Nancy, a 
completely unnecessary murder 



performed with an utter lack of 
feeling, made him so angry that he 
felt physically ill. 

‘ ‘Ma i n tain presen t h eading, 
Mike Zulu. Reduce to flight level 
four five zero. Twenty-three miles 
to run. ” 

“Mike Zulu,” he acknowledged, 
then tried again. 

“One of these days,” he went 
on quietly, “the governments are 
going to stop paying ransom 
money for hijacked aircraft and 
passengers and then you will be 
out of a job. And this green and 
pleasant land below us, with its 
thriving pirate economy, will feel 
the pinch. No government wants 
to be the first to throw three or 
four aircraft and a couple of 
thousand passengers to the 
wolves, of course, but there are a 
couple of administrations on the 
point of doing just that. It will 
take just one to make the decision 
and the rest will follow. 

“When that happens you, and 
the people below, will not have 
the benefit of consumer goods 
smuggled in at top prices,” he 
continued, “because you will have 
no money. You will have no 
money because your currency will 
be declared valueless and any you 
may have salted away on the 
continent will be frozen— the mea- 
sures are already being planned. 
You, assuming that you are the 
brain behind this hijack, should be 
intelligent enough to realize that 
you can’t possibly continue to—” 

He broke off as one of the 
hostesses, looking pale but with 
her voice steady enough, excused 
herself and asked for instructions. 



138 



GALAXY 




“We shall be landing on a run- 
way that is a rather tight fit,” he 
replied easily and smiled at her. 
“This means that I shall be mak- 
ing a steep approach, shoving on 
reverse thrust a few seconds after 
touchdown and stepping hard on 
the brakes. Make sure that their 
straps are tight and check the 
tables for loose objects. Right?” 

“If the runway is short, sir, 
how will we get off again?” 

He smiled reassuringly, thinking 
that the girl was too intelligent for 
her own peace of mind, and said, 
“This has happened to me before. 
The ransom covers the passengers, 
aircraft and crew but not the 
baggage and freight. We will be 
much lighter at takeoff.” 

“Yes, indeed,” said the man 
standing behind him. Perhaps he 
was irritated at being left out of 
the conversation, in which case he 
had displayed his first human feel- 
ing. 

When the girl had gone Devlin’s 
dream identify went on, “I am 
not probing for information use- 
ful to our security people and it 
doesn’t matter to me whether you 
are free-lance or employed by the 
government of this country. The 
people down there do not offi- 
cially boost their own hijack trade 
and you would never admit that 
you had been smuggled out as 
refugees to set up this operation. 

“And you could be telling the 
truth,” he continued, “because if 
you had come from this country 
you would do as Airfield Two 
suggests and divert. So you must 
be a free-lance group hoping to set 
yourselves up here with your 



share of the ransom. Fair enough 
—but there will be no ransom for 
anyone if we flop over and burn 
on Two’s runway, will there? And 
I hate to say anything complimen- 
tary about an operation that 
places so many people in jeo- 
pardy, but this job showed plan- 
ning of a high order and consider- 
able intelligence. Surely the same 
degree of intelligence and fore- 
thought will tell you that—” 

“Turn three degrees on to a 
heading of three-zero-one, Mike 
Zulu. Descend to flight level three 
zero. Eight miles to run. Have you 
the airfield in sight?” 

“Mike Zulu. Descend to three 
zero on three-zero-one. I see you, 
Two.” 

Behind him the man changed 
his captured gun from one hand 
to the other, but made no attempt 
to answer any of the questions. 

Angrily Devlin’s dream identity 
said, “This is the most beautiful, 
unpolluted and underpopulated 
country in the world. It has al- 
ways been beautiful, of course, 
and in the past it was very popular 
with tourists. But it is free of 
pollution because there is virtually 
no industry and its technical skills 
have gone with its people— those 
who were lucky enough to get 
away before immigration was for- 
bidden. Now there is no one who 
wants to come here except people 
like yourself. The lower orders of 
farmer and laborer are also trying 
to leave, many of them dying in 
the attempt. The country imports 
everything except a small propor- 
tion of its food and exports no- 
thing at all— and this beautiful and 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



139 




dangerously unstable country is 
where you want to spend the rest 
of your lives. Can’t you see how 
stupid that is?” 

The man sighed faintly but did 
not speak. 

Ahead of the plane the airfield 
was a tiny, flattened plus sign, 
pale gray against the hazy green 
patchwork of the surrounding 
fields. He made a last desperate 
appeal to the hijacker’s humanity 
as well as his reason. 

“You are not trying to right a 
political wrong or serving the 
cause of any minority group by 
coming here,” the dream -Devlin 
said. “You come to this place 
only if you are in this for the 
money. Fair enough— greed I can 
understand. But why gamble on 
losing so much when a twenty- 
minute diversion would give 
you a certain win? Or is it a 
feeling of power you need? The 
feeling that you are so much more 
vital and important than the ma- 
jority of poor, hardworking, dull 
sheep that their suffering is too 
small a matter to affect you? Or 
maybe this time you want to 
share their feelings! Are you, 
then, so terribly bored with life 
that you want to know what it 
feels like to be broken and torn 
apart and breathe in the fire of 
burning fuel—” 

He broke off, then added 
coldly: “I’m going to be very busy 
for a few minutes. Your answers 
can wait until after we land.” 

Two’s main runway was open- 
ing out below him like a gray 
isoceles triangle, spotty with 
clumps of weeds and cow drop- 



pings. The grass had not been 
trimmed for many years and the 
wind sent broad, green ripples 
hurrying across it. With maximum 
flap and barely enough power to 
stay in the air he aimed at putting 
down on the runway short of the 
threshold markings, because for 
this landing every yard would 
count. 

As well as catching the fully-ex- 
tended flaps like a sail and push- 
ing up the port wing, the cross- 
wind necessitated a crabwise ap- 
proach that would have to be 
corrected at the latest possible 
instant before touchdown if he 
weren’t to smash all the tires and 
probably rip off the undercarriage 
bogeys. He rounded out over a 
patch of swamp about a quarter- 
mile from threshold, with his stall 
warning having hysterics and his 
wings dipping first to one side and 
then the other as he compensated 
and overcompensated for the gust- 
ing. During the last few seconds 
before touchdown he found that 
he could anticipate the gust ef- 
fects by watching approaching 
wind ripples in the grass and as 
she began to sink he brought the 
nose on to the centerline of the 
runway. 

He felt two tires go and 
checked a slew to starboard while 
he dumped lift by running out the 
spoilers and calling up full reverse 
thrust. He would stick to the 
ground now, but the other end of 
the runway was rushing toward 
him at an incredible rate. He 
applied the brakes much harder 
than recommended for the pre- 
sent ground speed, then harder 



140 



GALAXY 




still. He felt another tire go, then 
three in rapid succession. Between 
them the landing bogeys had 
thirty -six tires and if the bursts 
were fairly evenly distributed 
among the three bogeys he might 
be all right. But apparently they 
weren’t and she began a slow, 
inexorable yaw to port. 

He was sure that the port 
wheels were about to go off the 
runway by the time he checked 
the yaw, and he had a glimpse of a 
man writhing about in the grass 
with his hands pressed against his 
ears and a noise-maddened cow 
running across the verge, but he 
did not feel the aircraft hit either. 
For an instant he thought cyni- 
cally that a pirate airfield with a 
too-short runway did not deserve a 
minimum noise approach and 
landing, and that in any case they 
would probably add the broken 
windows and curdled milk to the 
ransom amount, just as they 
would insist on an extra ransom 
for the aircraft and maintenance 
crew needed to fly in and fit the 
spare wheels to this brute before 
she could take off again. 

Another tire blew as the for- 
ward bogey stopped within a few 
yards of the boundary fence. He 
shut down everything except the 
auxiliary power unit serving the 
flight deck and cabin systems and 
settled back in his seat. 

“A very nice landing, Mike 
Zulu. ” 

“Thank you, Two.” 

Behind him the hijacker 
laughed softly and said, “I don’t 
think that a highly -trained, hard- 
working sheep like you will appre- 



ciate it, but this is the only answer 
I’ve got.” 

Something crashed through his 
head so fast that neither the pain 
nor the sound of the shot had 
time to register before a terrible 
darkness swallowed everything. 

B UT the darkness was not perma- 
nent. It became an infinite area 
of black velvet on which cards were 
displayed briefly before being re- 
placed or covered with other cards. 
Some of the cards were closely 
linked, such as the one for the 
co-pilot whose skipper had been 
killed before his eyes and who had 
crashed one of the world’s largest jets 
on takeoff— or the one of the hijack 
team-leader, whose action in killing 
the aircraft’s captain had led to the 
death of all the passengers and crew a 
few days later and in turn precipi- 
tated a crisis that wrecked the pirate 
economy of his adopted country. 

That hijacker, too, suffered briefly 
but intensely before he died. But his 
life-card was difficult to scan, the 
lines of cause and effect were tangled 
and his emotions and drives needed 
too much effort to understand, if 
they could be understood at all. 
There were not many lives like his — 
the majority, although painful in 
places, were easy to understand. 
Some of them were surprisingly rich 
and pleasant and many of these 
belonged to people whose lives, mea- 
sured against the yardstick of Dev- 
lin’s now vast and varied experience, 
should have been utterly miserable 
from the moment they had been 
born. 

Devlin had learned how to hold a 
life long enough to examine part of 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM

it, usually the last part, in detail . 

Lit by the last light of sunset, 
the great cranes of the long-aban- 
doned docks and shipyard stood 
out against the darkening sky like 
a sketch executed in blood. In 
more than fifty years of disuse 
they had rusted but they had not 
fallen down, just as the ships 
along the dockside had rusted and 
sunk at their moorings but had 
not gone away. They had, instead, 
grown outward as their hulls silted 
up and provided greenery for nest- 
ing swans and seabirds. One of the 
swans, deep pink in the fading 
light, drifted in mid-river as if it 
had nowhere to go. 

Like all the rest of us, he 
thought. 

Aloud he said, ‘This kind of 
approach has been made to me 
before. I don’t want to listen to 
you naming names in high places, 
or to your plans for overthrowing 
the Council, or to you extolling 
the virtues of the cause that is 
driving you to do these things. I 
am utterly disinterested in any- 
thing you want to say or do. I 
have heard it all before.” 

“Yes,” said the young man, 
“and you’ve done it all before.” 

He leaned his elbows on the 
parapet of the bridge and sighed, 
unable to make a negative answer. 

“You are going to listen be- 
cause this will interest you,” the 
other said fiercely. “We know you 
were a master tactician once, that 
you planned and carried through 
one of the neatest coups in recent 
history and that you could have 
had a high place in the Council if 



you hadn’t dropped out of sight 
and become a schoolteacher.” 

“That,” he said dryly, “was a 
tactic of survival. Considering the 
number of times that the Council 
has been replaced since then—” 

“They’ll be replaced again— and 
soon if—” 

“I’m not interested in listening 
to treason either,” he said tiredly. 

He could almost feel the inten- 
sity of the young man’s gaze on 
the side of his face as he contin- 
ued to watch the swan. Then the 
other said, “I agree— you are the 
survivor type. But there are times 
when one must take risks to go on 
surviving and right now we want 
you to take a very small risk. 
What we need is your advice— the 
benefit of your early studies and 
experience— for a small and not 
very bloody revolution.” 

“I’ve had my revolution and 
seen the results,” he replied, still 
without turning. “No.” 

The young man gripped his 
shoulder and pulled him around 
until they were face to face. He 
said, “Listen to me, you soft old 
man! This country is dying on its 
feet, the Council members are 
growing fat in their keeps and the 
local commanders in their forti- 
fied farms are not much better. 
Even the sheep have ceased to 
care that we are drifting into a 
feudal economy, even though one 
of the most technically advanced 
countries in the world can be seen 
from where we’re standing on a 
clear day. You once had the good 
of your country at heart. You had 
ideals you were willing to die 
for— but you did not die. Your 



142 



GALAXY 




wife did— and you ran away from 
everything and ended up teaching 
children— sheep children at that. 
You were good, the best— but not 
intelligent enough to realize that 
people must suffer and die for 
every advance.” 

What advance? he asked sardo- 
nically. But he asked it silently 
because he was, after all, still 
trying to survive. 

“Naturally we will handle the 
execution of the present Council 
and any local commanders unwill- 
ing to support us,” the young man 
went on. “But there are a lot of 
important people who want to 
play safe and who will not back us 
unless they think the takeover has 
popular support. This is where 
you come in. Specifically, we 
need your expertise in setting up a 
popular rebellion situation. Some- 
thing that will wake up the sheep, 
make martyrs of as many as them 
as seems necessary and get them 
personally involved in—” 

“The sheep won’t get involved 
any more,” he said and looked at 
the other’s hand on his shoulder 
until it was taken away. Then he 
went on: “The less sheepish ones 
have either left the country or 
become lower-grade supporters of 
the Council. The rest are patient, 
long-suffering and cynical.” 

The young man shook his head 
angrily and said, “We really are 
trying to better conditions for 
everybody this time— even the 
sheep. We have ideas for resuming 
trade with the mainland— legiti- 
mate trade that will enable us to 
build up some foreign credit. In- 
stead of a subsistence level eco- 



nomy we’ll be able to afford a few 
comforts again, and we’ll be able 
to rise once more to become—” 
“What exactly will you trade?” 
“I see you’re becoming less 
disinterested, old man,” said the 
other, smiling. “We trade some- 
thing that those soft, bored, over- 
crowded and polluted foreigners 
do not have— space, clean air, 
scenic grandeur and, most of all, 
excitement. We invite parties to 
join safaris into what used to be 
the most dangerous country in the 
world. We will take them to the 
historic places where it all hap- 
pened fifty years ago, and we’ll 
put on a show for them with 
bombings, ambushes and the rest 
of it. Some of them may even get 
hurt from time to time, but not 
badly. They will probably want to 
bring their own medics with them 
and pay us well for the privilege. 
But right now we need two things 
and one of them is you. 

“We need you because you 
have done this before, and very 
successfully,” the young man 
went on excitedly. “We are willing 
to pay a high price because we 
want it to be obvious that this is 
not simply another change of 
Council faces, but something dif- 
ferent and much better. Instead of 
a Council composed entirely of 
people in their twenties and late 
teens, we’ll have a new one led by 
an older and wiser head, someone 
with intelligence and judgment 
and experience, someone the for- 
eigners will be inclined to trust. 
Now get interested, old man— 
because we are offering you the 
top job!” 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM

He was silent for a moment, 
thinking about his experience and 
qualifications— because of one ex- 
perience his qualifications were 
gone. 

In those days he had been 
young, self-confident, idealistic 
and able effectively to compart- 
mentalize his mind so that the 
necessarily evil acts-which he 
planned and others carried out- 
did not trouble him. He and 
everyone had known that a 
greater good would come of them. 
He had been sorry, in a clinical 
fashion, for the innocent sheep 
who died or were maimed, but he 
had thought of them as statistics 
and had always tried hard to keep 
their number as low as possible. 
His wife had been, of course, far 
too sympathetic in her nature to 
be told of the work he had been 
doing, even if he had been allowed 
to tell her of it. But then one 
sunny afternoon outside a super- 
market she had become a statistic. 

He remembered her beauty and 
warmth and the concern she had 
felt for everything and everyone 
who suffered, the peace he had 
known in being with her, just 
watching her movements and ex- 
pression and the incredible pas- 
sion, so slow to kindle, with 
which she had loved him. For 
many years he had forced to the 
back of his mind and locked up in 
its compartment the picture of 
the torn and dismembered thing 
he had had to identify, but now 
the door was open again. 

He swallowed and said, “The 
top job, eh? But you mentioned 
needing two things.” 



“The other is money,” said the 
young man. “Money for arms and 
to pay off the local commanders 
whose estates will be used during 
the initial safaris. But the money 
is coming in nicely as a result of 
some minor-key hijacking of pri- 
vate aircraft—” 

“That is insane!” he burst out. 
“We were warned what would 
happen if we ever tried that 
again!” 

“Bluff,” said the other, laugh- 
ing. “Sheer bluff. Too many gov- 
ernments would like to move in 
here and we can play them off 
against each other. They need this 
underpopulated piece of real es- 
tate— they each need it so badly 
that none of them will let another 
take it. So relax. All but one of 
the aircraft were small, they were 
brought down in ordinary Fields 
closed to our supporters’ keeps, 
and the ransoms were ridiculously 
low by former standards. The 
reason for that was that we were 
also testing the hostages— they 
were private plane owners and 
their rich friends, remember— with 
the safari idea, and they all 
seemed keen. There was nothing 
in the foreign newspapers or TV 
about the incidents, so obviously 
everyone is keeping quiet and 
playing ball. And with the latest 
job, a two-hundred seat VTOL, 
they paid up promptly and with 
even less fuss than before. 

“This idea is going to work, old 
man,” he ended, with great cer- 
tainty in his voice. “We have 
something to sell, something they 
want badly enough to ignore a 
petty irritation like a few hijack- 



144 



GALAXY 




ings which will, in any case, stop 
as soon as the safari trade gets 
going. Well, what do you think?” 
All at once he felt deathly tired 
and, surprisingly, not at all afraid. 
He said, “We have sold, or at least 
exported, ideas and methods that 
have wrecked cities and countries 
all over the world. For that we 
have been isolated like a sociologi- 
cal disease. Now you have deve- 
loped a mutated strain that might 
possibly allow the disease to 
spread once again. Haven’t you 
considered the possibility— no, the 
virtual certainty, dammit! -that if 
one of them can’t have us they 
will make sure nobody will.” 

He turned once again to face 
the river mouth and the sea. A 
few minutes ago he had opened a 
frightful compartment in his 
mind, but there were many other 
compartments in which his wife 
was alive and beautiful and loving, 
and he wanted to open all of them 
while there was still time. The 
light had almost gone, so that the 
swan drifted in the black water 
like a graceful ghost and one 
bright star— or perhaps it was Jupi- 
ter— lit the darkened sky. 

And then she came homeward, 
With one star awake, 

As the swan in the evening. 
Moves over the lake. 

“What?” asked the young man 
irritably, making him realize that 
he had been thinking aloud. 

“I was remembering an old 
song that my wife liked to sing.” 
“That’s sheep thinking!” the 
other said angrily. “We’re.offering 
you the number-one spot and all 
you can think of is—” He broke 



off and swung around to stare 
across the city and beyond. 

The sky had lightened again in 
the west and suns were rising in all 
the wrong places. But before he 
could even feel afraid and long 
before the sound of the nuclear 
explosions reached him, the sun 
aimed at this particular city burst 
above his head with a flash of 
impossibly bright light that was 
followed by absolute darkness. 

XVIII 

T HEIR lives pressed in to fill the 
darkness— lives in uncountable 
numbers and all clamoring, it seemed 
to Devlin, to be remembered. Most 
of them were ordinary lives at first 
feel, but even the mundane ones had 
their moments of glory which made 
them unique and, in the majority of 
cases, the equals of the brilliant, 
hyper-sensitive individuals who some- 
times created without control, who 
sought power without responsibility 
and who were flawed without ever 
having tried to correct their flaws. 

Some of the flaws he observed 
were minor and easily overcome. 
Others were major and overcome 
with extreme difficulty and many 
were impossible to overcome no 
matter how hard the individual tried. 
The flaws ranged from petty dis- 
honesty, selfishness, minor-key de- 
structiveness and character assassina- 
tion in otherwise normal individuals 
up to the bright, fuzzy, helpless 
struggles of a short-lived mongoloid 
and the perverted intensity of feeling 
experienced by men deeply and emo- 
tionally involved with other homo- 
sexuals. 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



145 




Viewing all with complete know- 
ledge, Devlin could no longer be sure 
what, if anything, was a perversion— 
to understand all was to forgive 
almost everything. But he still felt 
repulsed by some aspects of life, 
principally the perversions which de- 
pended for their pleasure on the 
sufferings of others. To him it 
seemed basically wrong that one per- 
son’s pleasure should cost others 
pain. As a result these lives as a 
whole were highly unpleasant to re- 
call— save only for a few youthful 
incidents-so that they hung in the 
dark outer fringes of his memory like 
books in a corner of a library that 
was rarely visited. 

Death, suffering and sex left the 
strongest impressions in every life — 
this was probably the reason Devlin 
had almost been driven to suicide by 
the earlier cold dreams. But now he 
could be selective in his choice of 
individuals and incidents and he was 
beginning to enjoy the process when 
a gradual diminution of sensation 
made him realize that he was coming 
out of cold sleep. 

He tried to fight it for as long as 
possible by holding on to his most 
recent selection, an incident follow- 
ing a domestic quarrel when both 
parties were pretending that it had 
never happened but had not reached 
the stage of kissing and making up. 
The period was contemporary, or 
perhaps a decade or two in Devlin’s 
Earth past, and the rather one-sided 
discussion was taking a philosophical 
turn which gave it applicability to 
the present . 

Their house had always been 

too small and the area of the tiny 



back garden was further reduced 
by the thickness of the tall hedge 
on three sides which gave privacy 
and a feeling— only a feeling-of 
security. Caught in that suntrap 
and sandwiched between the hot, 
dry grass and the nuclear-powered 
heater in the sky, he felt himself 
begin to relax enough to start 
apologizing. 

“You’re right, dear,” he said, 
staring sunward through the 
bright redness of his closed' eye 
lids. “This place is no longer safe. 
It is also becoming too expensive. 
I was hoping that it wouldn’t be 
and was trying to keep it going, 
which is why I accused you of 
being ungrateful and never satisi- 
fied . Well, anyway, living in a 
Block will be much less expensive 
and, even though the sunshine will 
be artificial, the place will have 
effective group security and we 
won’t have to worry about—” 

“I know what you said about 
the statistical element is true,” she 
broke in. “There are far too many 
people like ourselves for us— for 
this house— to stand much chance 
of being hit. But yesterday was 
the first time I actually saw 
Maxers in action. She— she was a 
shoplifter the store detective had 
caught outside the main entrance. 
The Maxers pushed him away and 
cut off her hand. They enjoyed 
doing it-.” 

Her hand crept into his and he 
squeezed it reassuringly as he said, 
“Maximum Response looked liked 
the answer a few years ago. The 
soft approach of the psychologists 
and sociologists wasn’t working 
and society brought back corporal

punishment administered, if ne- 
cessary, by citizens on the spot. 
But now was have so-called citi- 
zens going around searching for 
crimes to punish, and the idea of 
maximum response to minimum 
offenses, while it sorted out our 
crime problem in short order, has 
been twisted out of shape like all 
the other good ideas. Now we’re 
getting Maxer gangs setting up 
minor incidents for them to react 
to, or even delivering a maximum 
and downright murderous re- 
sponse to a mere rumor of an 
offense -and they start the ru- 
mor.” 

“It isn’t just the Maxers,” she 
said, moving so that her sun- 
warmed arm and leg were pressing 
against his. “I read last week that 
four hundred violent deaths per 
day— that includes night, too, of 
course— is now considered to be 
an acceptable figure for a med- 
ium-sized city like ours. What is 
the matter with people? We have 
enough to eat. There is plenty of 
entertainment— lots of interesting 
things to do with one’s spare 
time— and there would be no sick- 
ness if the hospitals weren’t so 
overcrowded with nuts who tried 
unsuccessfully to carve each other 
up or botched the job on an 
innocent bystander. Scientifically 
and culturally we should be living 
in a golden age— so why are so 
many bored and angry and vio- 
lent? 

“I’m not really asking ques- 
tions,” she went on before he 
could speak. “Just complaining. I 
know you would say that differ* 
ent and often unlikable people 



have always been responsible for 
the world’s advances in art and 
science— they prod us ahead more 
quickly, like dogs snapping at the 
heels of cattle. Maybe that’s what 
is wrong. The cattle should have 
been allowed to wander forward 
at their own pace, getting where 
they were supposed to go with 
herdsmen leading them instead of 
dogs and wolves driving them. I 
grant you, that we have a few 
responsible people trying to push 
us in the right direction. But their 
attitude of mind is never to con- 
sider individuals, only the big pic- 
ture, and to consider females as 
mere statistics and unworthy of 
serious male attention once they 
pass the age of thirty. It is no 
coincidence that the proportion 
of female suicides in this age 
group is-” 

“You,” he broke in firmly, 
“will always have my serious at- 
tention, even when you are old 
and gray and your statistics have 
changed out of all recognition.” 

“In ten years,” she said more 
quietly, “I wonder if you will still 
say that.” 

Reassurance given too often 
loses its effect, he thought and 
tried to move the conversation on 
to a less sensitive area. 

“Of course I will,” he said. 
“But to go back to something you 
said earlier about boredom and 
violence coupled with high tech- 
nology and culture— I’ve been try- 
ing to make sense out of the 
present situation, too. It seems 
purposeless and stupid and I cer- 
tainly don’t approve of it, but 
suppose there is, in fact, a reason 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



147 




behind it— perhaps an evolution- 
ary process that went wrong. Sup- 
pose the wolves were intended to 
inherit the Earth, and do some- 
thing constructive with it— but 
they were hampered by too many 
sheep getting underfoot and prac- 
tically begging to be eaten or 
beaten or enslaved or used in 
some other fashion. So, instead of 
having to fight against something 
hard and dangerous that would 
have kept them in top condition, 
they’ve been reduced to punching 
at pillows and feeling frustrated.” 

“I’m sorry for them,” she said 
with obvious insincerity. 

“Seriously,” he went on, “let us 
assume that the present mess the 
world is in presages the next step 
up the evolutionary ladder. The 
cultural level is sufficiently high, 
as is the technical ability, and 
there is certainly enough popula- 
tion pressure to force people off 
the planet. Evolutionary changes 
are never pleasant and the next 
one could be the most unpleasant 
of all, because it might take us to 
the stars—” 

“It might take them to the 
stars,” she broke in laughing. 
“And good riddance.” 

“Every time I started by saying 
‘seriously’ you end by laughing,” 
he said, shaking his head. “I sim- 
ply wanted to discuss the idea 
that, if and when the human race 
gets out among the stars, it might 
not meet benevolent bug-eyed 
monsters belonging to beautiful 
and benign cultures, but instead 
will be faced with beings so 
vicious that, by comparison, an 
Earth tiger would look like a 



sheep. And if the race managed to 
survive that contact— perhaps even 
win— there might be something 
even more terrible waiting for us 
on the next rung. In short, I’m 
suggesting that the universe might 
not be a pleasant place and that 
we— the pacifists— by insisting that 
it should be, are seducing the race 
from its rightful path and destroy- 
ing its chance of future— ” 

“But surely,” she broke in, 
“the race couldn’t have reached 
the level of technology necessary 
to leave Earth if we hadn’t gone in 
for cooperation instead of con- 
flict. Too many people only want 
to destroy things and hurt 
others.” 

“Only because they are frus- 
trated by having too many sheep 
telling them they are wrong,” he 
replied. “You must try to think of 
a pure, highly moral, violent type 
with the power to use the world’s 
sheep effectively—” 

“Power corrupts and abso- 
lute—” she began. 

“Highly moral and incorrup- 
tible, then,” he said. “A sublime, 
violent type.” 

“Causing sublime and charac- 
ter-building suffering, no doubt.” 
she said witheringly. “That is ridi- 
culous and you know it— and you 
know I know you know it. You 
were always pulling that trick at 
university— starting a major debate 
to effect a minor change of sub- 
ject— and you’re still doing it.” 
She laughed suddenly and went 
on: “It worked then when I got 
too involved in something unpleas- 
ant— and it still seems to be work- 
ing. But before we leave the 



148 



GALAXY 




Maxers— I’ve heard that their lat- 
est excuse for turning loose with 
everything is in defense of a lady’s 
honor. They feel quite noble 
about defending the honor of a 
helpless woman to the death— the 
other person’s death, of course, 
even if the poor man happens to 
be a slightly impolite husband.” 

“As 1 remember,” he said, “you 
were pretty good at defending 
your own honor. But I’ll be care- 
ful not to insult you in public.” 

She was silent for a moment, 
then she let go of his hand and he 
heard her roll on to her side and 
prop herself up on one elbow. Her 
other hand rested lightly on his 
chest, then more heavily as she 
leaned across him. The movement 
of her head shadowed his face 
from the sun and he opened his 
eyes. 

He said, “I’ll try not to insult 
you in private either -or have any 
more stupid fights. But let’s 
change the subject, eh?” 

The pressure of her hand be- 
came lighter until its touch be- 
came the beginning of a caress and 
her face moved closer to his. She 
shook her head and said softly, 
“Not yet, dear. Let’s find out if 
you are capable of a— a maximum 
response.” 

It became a very pleasant 
dream after that, even though the 
sensations became rapidly less in- 
tense as the process of resuscita- 
tion was completed. But he was 
glad rather than sorry about that 
because, considering the depraved 
period in which he had spent his 
formative years his upbringing had 
been fairly strict and the increas- 



ingly ecstatic face above him was 
familiar. 

It was much more youthful and 
beautiful and relaxed than he had 
ever remembered it, but there 
could be no doubt that it was his 
mother . 

GOOD MORNING DEVLIN 

H E SIGNALED that he was fully 
awake and in possession of all 
Iris faculties by looking around his 
cubicle, putting one hand on the 
edge of the open casket and saying, 
“Good morning, ship.” 

Devlin was feeling relieved and a 
bit light-hearted because this time he 
had been warmed without feeling 
that the cold dreams had driven him 
to the vergeness of madness or sui- 
cide. He wondered if Patricia and the 
others had been equally fortunate.

After more than nine centuries, he

was looking forward too eagerly to 
comparing mental notes with Patricia

of worry it deserved.

advice and instructions programed 
into it what seemed like only a few 
hours ago. It was still good advice 
and he ought to take it, ought to 
show a little self-control by forcing 
himself to sleep normally before 
rushing out to see Patricia. With luck, 
she might grow impatient and come 
in and wake him .

was not being very informative.

He hurried through the post-awak- 
ening exercises and into the corridor, 
where he met Patricia coming out of 
her cubicle. There was no need for 
them to rush to the control center, 
but they did. The main display was 
more forthcoming.

speed— they were, after all, supposed 
to study it carefully. But as the 
minutes and the bright, sharp data 
presentations unrolled before them 
they saw nothing to make either of 
them feel any better. 

The personnel status display gave 
them the first shock. They had been 
expecting the telltales of the cubicles 
containing Yvonne Caldwell and 
Thomas Purdy to be dark, but not 
the twenty-three others. The people 
concerned were not actually dead 
because they were still safely in cold 
sleep. But the cubicles concerned 
were flagging mechanical and/or 
power malfunctions which would 
make it impossible for them to be 
revived. 

Patricia looked as sick as Devlin 
felt. 

He was suddenly aware that the 
bright, clean control center with its 
gleaming instrumentation, spotless 
trim and virtually unused upholstery 
was no longer new, even though it 
appeared unchanged from the first 
time he had seen it— less than two 
weeks or over nine hundred years 
ago. Despite the surface cosmetics of 
rustless metal and bright plastic the 
control center and the ship built 
around it was old. 

Devlin shrugged involuntarily as 
the sheer wonder of it tightened the 
skin at the back of his scalp. For nine 
centuries the ship had been picking 
its way among the stars, a fragile 
metal pod protecting its human seed- 
lings. The men and women who had 
designed and built the ship, the 
programers who had given it the 
ability to follow its complex instruc- 
tions while maintaining the lives of 
its utterly vulnerable charges and the 



countless other people who had 
helped unknowingly or unwillingly 
or who had not helped at all, were 
long since gone. Even though he 
could still remember them and the 
society to which they belonged as if 
it were last week, they, and probably 
it, were dead. 

The realization so frightened him 
that he tried hard to be optimistic. 
But the very most he could hope for 
was that a sick but surviving remnant 
of humanity was still living in the 
polluted wreckage of a once-great 
culture, on a world so impoverished 
in material resources that its domi- 
nant life form would never be able to 
pull itself up and into space again. 
Nor would it ever again be capable of 
expelling another seed pod among 
the stars. 

Even the pod it had expelled— and 
perhaps it had managed to shoot out 
two or three— was beginning to 
weaken, lose its initial impetus and 
suffer from a withered casing. Very 
soon it had to find fallow ground. 

Or any ground. 

Devlin gestured toward the status 
board and said, “Do you want to go 
over it again?” 

“I’ve got a good memory,” she 
replied. She added: “Now.” 

H E NODDED and began tapping 
for a rundown on the ship 
systems, insisting on a slow playback. 
His memory, like Patricia’s, was near- 
ly perfect— but he was not a super- 
man. He still felt like himself even 
though he could remember every 
single thing that had ever happened 
to him and to a countless number of 
other people. He still felt afraid and 
stupid and baffled by the complexity 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



151 




of the data being presented on the 
screen. 

Or was he? 

“I have the feeling,” he said, “that 
I understand what is going on a little 
better.” 

“Yes,” said Patricia. “I have the 
same feeling. That instructor— the 
small, blond one, remember? -knew 
a lot about the ship’s computer even 
though she didn’t tell us anything 
more than which buttons to push. 
I’m remembering some of the things 
she knew.” 

“I see,” said Devlin. “During the 
attack from Target Five I had a 
funny feeling that I knew more 
about the ship’s control and guidance 
systems than I’d ever been taught. I 
take it that you dreamed about this 
girl’s lifetime. 

“No,” said Patricia firmly. “I did 
not dream about her, but I’m getting 
her memories anyway. She must have 
spent a lot of time in here, so maybe 
she is haunting the place.” She shook 
her head in irritation. Then: “That 
last cold sleep wasn’t as bad as the 
one before, but I seemed to be every 
woman who was ever born— with the 
exception of a few twisted and hor- 
rible ones that were too difficult or 
unpleasant to remember. But what is 
happening to us? And why do I 
always dream of being a woman?” 

“I’m always a man,” said Devlin. 
“Or at least a male. I don’t know 
what is happening to us either.” He 
stopped as a clear, sharp picture of 
Brother Howard was thrown on his 
mental display screen. It was the 
picture in which the Brother looked 
concerned and spoke without sound. 
Feeling afraid for some reason he 
could not understand, he said, “But 



let’s not get sidetracked into a philo- 
sophical debate. At least— not just 
yet.” 

“I need a philosophical debate,” 
said Patricia seriously, “before I go 
mad. I need some answers.” 

“Me, too. But right now let’s 
concentrate on the patient— I mean 
the ship.” 

She smiled and said dryly, “Was 
one of your dream lifetimes a man- 
called Freud?” 

As the displays presented their 
data it became apparent that the 
patient was in good physical and 
mental condition, considering its ad- 
vanced age. The heart was sound- 
power was available for the decades- 
long deceleration and just enough 
fuel for a landing— and capable of at 
least one burst of sustained activity 
without failure, provided the effort 
were called for before the patient 
became much older. Peripheral circu- 
lation and sensitivity were not good, 
but, again, adequate for a few 
decades to come. The ship’s long- 
and close-range sensors had suffered 
from multiple component failures, 
but it could still see and hear in a 
shortsighted and dull fashion, which 
was the reason why they had not 
been awakened until the ship was 
passing within the orbit of the outer- 
most planet of the system. The 
patient needed to hold things close 
to his eyes. 

Not sick, Devlin thought, just 
senility rearing its toothless, graying 
head. What he needed now was an 
accurate prognosis before the brain, 
too, began to succumb to the aging 
processes. 

He did not realize that he had 
been thinking aloud until Patricia, 



152 



GALAXY 




with her newfound expertise, called 
up the required data. 

ACCORDING to the display, if the 
/V system they were entering were 
bypassed the chances of reaching the 
next target sun were ninety-three per 
cent. The power needed to decelerate 
and return to Target Ten would be 
available. Data gathering systems 
would be less than sixty per cent 
operational. Life-support and resusci- 
tation systems had a predicted failure 
of thirty-seven per cent. Personnel 
consumables would remain adequate 
due to the projected death rate 
caused by life-support and resuscita- 
tion system failures.

EXTERIOR SENSORS SIXTY-FIVE

“That’s enough,” said Devlin ang- 
rily, hitting the Cancel button. To go 
on would be virtual suicide. More 
quietly he added: “We don’t have 
much choice, so let’s have a look at 
our new home.” 

The pictures from the orbiting 
probe showed a world that appeared 
to be two-thirds ocean and whose 
continental outlines were obscured 
by dazzling weather systems and a 
thick atmospheric haze. On the ad- 
jacent display appeared the figures 
for the atmospheric pressure and 
spectro-analysis, gravity, analyses of 



suspended water vapor and surface 
liquid from the ocean and inland 
lakes, measurements of radio and 
nuclear radiation, pollution levels in 
areas around the few small cities and 
towns. 

“We’ll be able to live there,” said 
Devlin quietly. “It won’t be easy at 
first. We’ll have trouble with strained 
backs and varicose veins. But in a 
couple of generations we’ll grow the 
muscles to cope and if the natives are 
friendly—” He broke off, his mind 
racing too fast for coherent verbaliza- 
tion. Then: “A planet like this 
should have a much larger popula- 
tion. Considering the level of tech- 
nology here it should be densely 
populated, in fact. I wonder—” 

He halted the playback on the 
gray cross-hatching of a small coastal 
town and stepped up the magnifica- 
tion. Distortion caused by the turbu- 
lent but very clean air made it 
difficult to resolve fine details, but 
he could see a number of parks, the 
largest containing a silvery domelike 
structure, an airfield and a river that 
bisected the town. There was no 
evidence of railways or large ocean- 
going ships or dockyard facilities. 
For a town the place looked cur- 
iously fresh and clean. 

“You wonder what?” said Patricia 
when the silence had begun to drag. 

“I wonder why there are no large 
ships, railheads or major road 
systems linking those towns. They’re 
so widely separated that air-travel is 
probably the only convenient way of 
getting around— but is it enough? I 
also wonder why the place looks so 
self-sufficient and why, on the long 
road up to a nuclear technology, it 
didn’t pick up a few industrial ruins 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



153 




and sooty factory chimneys. In 
short, I wonder if we are the first 
ship to come along— and if we are not 
looking at an established colony.” 
“Yes, of course!” said Patricia 
excitedly, then, “But would they 
send two ships like this on exactly 
the same course? And surely the 
computer would have told us if the 
radio signals were intelligible?” 
Devlin’s elation faded. She was 
right. The world below, he was still 
sure, was a colony fairly recently set 
up— say five or six generations ago at 
most. But it was not a human 
colony. 

Patricia was already calling up the 
data from the soft-landed probe. 

B Y A process of electronic analy- 
sis, chemical and biochemical ex- 
amination and the sampling of plant 
and animal life in the vicinity, the 
probe was turning a remote-con- 
trolled microscope on one tiny piece 
of the world, and from its observa- 
tions it was deducing the makeup of 
the planet as a whole. For the most 
part the results reported were nega- 
tive. % 

There was no evidence of harmful 
organisms. There was a wide range of 
plant and animal life, but the sizes of 
individual specimens were relatively 
small due to the greater gravity and, 
while there were strong indications 
that some of the larger animals were 
carnivorous, most varieties of animal 
and plant tissues were suitable for 
human consumption and would aug- 
ment or eventually replace the Earth 
grains they had brought along. There 
was nothing in the report to fright- 
en— or even seriously worry— any 
would-be colonist. 



“Let’s have the visuals,” said Dev- 
lin. 

On the main screen appeared an 
unsteady picture of the planetary 
surface from an altitude of fifty 
thousand feet. The probe’s vision 
pickup was directed forward, so that 
the picture showed half-black and 
half the dazzling white of the cloud 
carpet. 

The vehicle was shedding height 
rapidly and the cloud layer began to 
show graduations of light and shade 
and to take on a three-dimensional 
aspect. Individual clouds were sliding 
over the horizon and whipping past 
the probe and suddenly it was 
through and over the sea at three 
thousand feet and approaching the 
largest coastal town. Devlin had a 
glimpse of buildings and a park be- 
low rushing past— then the probe was 
close to the ground and crossing 
above a road with a moving vehicle in 
it. He saw small animals running, 
vegetation beautifully formed and 
colored and hugging the ground for 
protection against the high winds— 
and the screen went blank.

ING. MAJOR MALFUNCTION IN VI-

W ITHOUT being asked, Patricia 
tapped for a slow playback of 
the sequence covering the flight over 
the town and the close approach to 
the ground. As the images were 
crawling slowly across the screen she 
gave an uncomfortable laugh and 
said, “I know how this thing works- 



154 



GALAXY 




I could almost build it. That instruc- 
tor’s knowledge is in my mind. Is 
there such a thing as. retroactive 
telepathy?” 

“Maybe,” said Devlin dryly, “she 
is haunting the place.” 

“Maybe,” Patricia replied with a 
shiver, “she is haunting me. Is it 
possible that—” 

Devlin said firmly, “Concentrate 
on the display and freeze the picture 
if you see something you think is 
important. Look, we’re above the 
town now and crossing the park—” 

The streets were broad, well- 
planned and pleasantly decorated 
with vegetation. Architecture tended 
to be functional, squat and with a 
firm grip on the ground— nothing 
seemed to rise higher than four 
stories and the small, shutter-fitted 
windows and curved roofing were 
protection against high winds. In the 
center of the park the object Devlin 
earlier had imagined to be a silvery 
dome was now revealed as a gigantic 
sphere, tarnished by time and 
weather and the heat-discoloration of 
re-entry. Devlin wondered if the de- 
scendants of the Earth colonists 
would put a park around their ship in 
memory of where they had come 
from, if things worked out right and 
they were able to take root here. 

Even with maximum magnifi- 
cation he could not resolve the 
images of the beings in the streets. 

“It’s a nice place,” said Patricia as 
the probe dropped lower above the 
wooded country beyond the town. 
“We could do much worse. And we 
can always land well away from the 
other colonists’ towns. The planet is 
almost empty, and by the time they 
discover us we may have discovered a 



way of making friends with them.” 

“That’s true,” said Devlin. “Unless 
they find the probe and deduce its 
purpose and organize some kind of 
defense. We’ll need a long time to 
decelerate and return here, remem- 
ber— seventy, maybe, eighty years— 
and they’ll have plenty of time to 
prepare and to fill some of the empty 
spaces with their kind.” 

“Defense? But we’re not attack- 
ing.” 

“They don’t know that.” 

She was silent for a moment, her 
expression troubled. Then: “Maybe 
they won’t find the probe. But I’m 
worried about the driver of the 
vehicle it passed over . Here it is 
now.” 

The road was a gray diagonal 
bisecting the screen with the wheeled 
vehicle hurrying along it and away 
from the probe, which was overtak- 
ing but increasing its lateral distance 
as it dropped lower. Their view 
moved from the three-quarters rear 
aspect to almost a side elevation 
before intervening trees threatened 
to hide the vehicle from sight. Simul- 
taneously their fingers stabbed to- 
ward the Hold button and collided 
above it. They began to laugh and 
Devlin tapped for full magnification. 

They stopped laughing. 

The image was quite sharp. It 
showed a sturdy four-wheeled vehicle 
with a transparent canopy with three 
beings— two adults and a child - 
inside. More than enough of their 
bodies was visible to make identifica- 
tion positive. 

They belonged to the same species 
which, during Pass Five, had made 
three attempts to blow the Earth 
ship out of the sky.

66 T KNOW enough— at least I re- 

X member enough— to be sure 
that we won’t survive at all if we 
go on,” said Patricia angrily. 
“We’ve got no guarantee that Tar- 
get Ten’s system will even be habi- 
table, and by the time we get to 
Eleven— if we ever get to Eleven— 
the ship will be three-quarters dead 
so will half the people in it. I do 
know enough,” she raged on, “to 
know that I don’t know enough to 
carry out effective repairs on any- 
thing but the simplest systems. 
That girl was a programer, not a 
team of technicians!” 

She was angry because they had 
spent several hours arguing in circles 
and now they were going around the 
same old circuit yet again. 

“I still think this is too important 
a decision for two people to take,” 
said Devlin stubbornly. 

Shaking her head impatiently she 
said, “I’ve already explained why 
they shouldn’t be. If we choose to 
make this decision by democratic 
process we will have to wake every- 
one whose cold sleep resuscitation 
systems are still operational, explain 
everything to them, then wait while 
everyone tries to make up his/her 
mind. It is hard enough getting two 
people to make up their minds. Well, 
isn’t it?” Devlin did not reply and 
she rushed on: “As things are now 
we have two choices. To go for 
Target Ten or decelerate for a return 
here. We have a pretty good chance 
of making a successful landing here, 
and a much poorer chance of landing 
at Ten— if it even has a suitable 
planet. But if we wake everybody 
now— think of the power demand, 



the increased chances of system fail- 
ure, the drain on consumables while 
everyone is arguing and trying to 
reach a decision. If we wake every- 
one there won’t be a choice, because 
the power drain caused by a general 
warming up— something that’s only 
supposed to happen once during the 
voyage, during the pre-landing or- 
bit— we won’t be able to make it to 
Ten.” She gestured toward the main 
display and added: “We’ve seen the 
figures and we know what will hap- 
pen. At least / know.” 

Patricia was convinced that she 
was right, Devlin thought angrily, 
and he already had proof of how far 
she would go once her mind had 
been made up about something— the 
wound in her cheek, six weeks or 
nine centuries old, was only begin- 
ning to form scar tissue. But his own 
anger, he realized suddenly, was 
chiefly due to the fact that he 
himself knew that she was right. 

“At least,” he said, “let’s sleep on 
it.” 

“And have the same decision to 
make when we wake,” she said, with 
a note of desperation creeping into 
her voice. “I don’t think I could 
stand that. We won’t be any better 
informed than we are now. I think 
that we have no choice at all but to 
decelerate and return for a landing 
here and you know it!” 

“I know it,” said Devlin. “I always 
have.” 

But his strongest feeling as he 
depressed the big red Mission Ter- 
mination button was not of anger at 
being bested in an argument or fear 
of the consequences-it was simply 
one of relief followed by a feeling of 
complete anticlimax.

GALAXY 




P OSSIBLY the highly complex 
brain of the ship was aware of 
the drama of the situation.. Perhaps 
that inhuman mind and cold, metal- 
lic and aging body knew a sense of 
exhilaration that her journey’s end 
was a relatively short time away. But 
the sole outward indications she gave 
were the constantly changing data 
displays on the main screen, telling 
of new systems being checked out, 
predictions regarding power con- 
sumption during the decades of de- 
celeration that stretched ahead. 
Gradually Patricia’s and Devlin’s eyes 
and minds grew tired of watching 
displays and began to wander toward 
each other. 

“I’m sorry for being nasty to you 
back there,” Patricia said after a long 
and obviously worried silence. “It 
was just that you seemed to be so—” 
“Stupid?” asked Devlin, smiling. 
“Don’t worry about it. If you had 
been the one who was dithering I 
would probably have hit you with 
the same arguments. It’s just that I’m 
the worrying type. I like to be as sure 
of things as possible. For instance— 
right now I’m thinking about the 
cold sleep cubicles and the number 
of exercise-only awakenings sche- 
duled before we arrive back here. I’m 
especially concerned about the 
power drain and the increased proba- 
bility of casualties through compo- 
nent failure that even a small and 
periodic power demand could cause. 
We’re now pretty sure that no physi- 
ological or memory damage will oc- 
cur during an extended period of 
cold sleep, so I was wondering if it 
were possible for you to program us 
for just one more awakening— the 
final one.” 



She nodded and smiled, yet some- 
how managed to look even more 
miserable. Devlin released his straps 
and moved to the edge of her couch. 

He asked, “What’s really bothering 
you?” 

She gripped his hands tightly, but 
refused to meet his eyes as she said, 
“My— my memories are bothering 
me— and I’m also afraid of what will 
happen after we land. But right now 
the problem is my memories. I can 
remember being some very bad peo- 
ple and being in a lot of bad situa- 
tions. I’m afraid that I may have 
experienced too much— that I’ll be all 
used up emotionally and that no- 
thing will be new anymore—” 

She stopped and Devlin had the 
impression she was at a loss for 
words to express all she felt and was 
going to cry. 

He said, “You experienced no- 
thing during cold sleep— and your 
memories in biological time are your 
own business. What you have are 
simply memories. I have some pretty 
hectic memories myself, but I think 
we’ve established that they’re the 
product of an intensive education 
program. Our mental notebooks are 
full to bursting. We are hot on theory 
and in a very short time, say four 
hours’ normal sleep and a couple of 
days in pre-landing orbit, we will be 
able to get together and compare 
notes.” 

Gently he lifted her hands and put 
them behind his neck, then forced 
her to look at him. He added, “We 
are exactly the same people we al- 
ways were— perhaps more so.” 

H E THOUGHT of Brother Ho- 
ward and the things both he and 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



157 




Patricia had been told about the 
colonization project and about the 
things he must have been told but 
could not now remember. The dream 
of the Brother talking seriously to 
him— without making a sound— that, 
surely, had been his subconscious 
trying to break a post-hypnotic com- 
mand not to remember when he 
awoke. 

But the command had not forbid- 
den him to remember the incident 
when he was asleep and now Devlin 
had developed a highly retentive 
memory regarding his dreams . 

He said abruptly, “When next we 
take our riormsd sleep, I don’t think 
we should meet again before cool- 
down. I want to concentrate all of 
my thinking on the Brother, because 
we still have an awful lot of ques- 
tions and that way 1 may be able to 
dream the answers. Do you remem- 
ber how he talked— in broad, philo- 
sophical terms— about seeding the 
stars?” he went on. “Could it be that 
the reason you remember only fem- 
inine dreams and I the masculine is 
to make sure that when we arrive the 
seeds will germinate properly?” 

As she nodded he remembered 
something else the Brother had told 
him— an old parable about seeds, 
some of which had fallen on stony 
ground, others among thorns and the 
rest on fallow soil. In that parable 
there had been three options, but 
here he could see only the stony and 
perhaps nonexistent ground of Tar- 
gets Ten and Eleven, which they 
might never reach— and the thorns of 
Nine. Among the thorns they might 
at least take root for a while before 
being choked off. Among the thorns 
they stood a fighting chance— if 



sheep could fight. The ship’s person- 
nel, he remembered had been care- 
fully chosen from among Earth’s 
sheep— not the wolves. 

She must have read his thoughts 
from his expression because her 
fingers curled gently around the back 
of his neck and she began caressing 
the area behind his ears. “Don’t 
worry about it,” she murmured. 
“We’ve taken the decision and now 
there is no point in worrying.” 
Slowly but firmly she pulled his face 
closer to hers. “I’m trying to reach 
another decision about whether or 
not to break a very strict ship’s 
regulation . .” 

They took a long time considering 
that regulation, which they seriously 
bent but did not actually break. 
When they finally forced themselves 
apart the main screen had ceased its 
continuous data presentations and 
was displaying one message only.

Deliberately they did not discuss 
the data or say anything at all until 
they parted at Patricia’s cubicle and 
then they simply kissed and wished 
each other good night.

focus all of his mind on Brother

Howard while he composed himself 
for sleep. Even when his fitful dozing 
gave way to the shallows -preceding 
deep slumber, the wish-fulfillment 
dreams with the image and sound 
and feel of Patricia in them kept 
getting in the way as she demonstra- 
ted various delightful ways of break- 
ing that ship’s-regulation. In spite of 
these interruptions he finally did 
begin to dream about the Brother, 
then about Patricia and himself in a 
room with the Brother, who was 
seated beside the old psychologist’s 
wheelchair, facing them. 

The psychologist was also talking 
to them silently, but suddenly the 
sound came through . 

“. You will be given a strong, 
drug-reinforced post-hypnotic 
command to forget everything 
that you will be told during this 
session,” said the frail old man in 
his tremendously deep voice. 
“Whether the command will hold 
over the time-scale we will be 
dealing with is another matter. We 
sincerely hope that it will hold 
long enough, at least, to protect 
you from serious mental disorien- 
tation, because tied to this com- 
mand is an even more important 
one designed to force you to 
recall your cold sleep dreams in 
chronological order. You will have 
enough to contend with, psycho- 
logically speaking, without having 
to handle an intensely vivid dream 
life which is apparently running 
backward. 

“But before the Brother tries to 
explain what is likely to happen 
to you, let me assure you that the 
hypno-conditioning is not in- 



tended merely to hide the truth 
from you. We are trying to pro- 
tect your minds from we are not 
sure what and prepare them for 
the same thing. Perhaps there is 
no need to do this. Perhaps the 
thing will happen to us naturally, 
when the time comes, as repro- 
duction. Perhaps we are wasting 
our time by trying to teach cater- 
pillars to think like butterflies. 
The truth is that we just are not 
sure what the truth is, and we are 
trying to hedge our bets. 

“Too much talking tires me.” 
The old man was tapping the 
control studs on his wheelchair 
and moving toward the door as he 
added: “The Brother will try to 
explain it all to you— without 
becoming too philosophical or re- 
ligious, I hope. When he is fin- 
ished I shall return to reinforce 
the hypnotic commands and, of 
course, to wish you good luck.” 

When Brother Howard began to 
speak it seemed as if he were 
simply going to repeat their first 
project orientation lecture. Still 
without telling them whether it 
was the first, forty-second or only 
interstellar colonization vessel, he 
briefly described the ship and its 
systems, its capabilities and its 
projected course. It would be 
powered by a low-thrust drive 
which would accelerate it over the 
space of several decades to a 
velocity roughly one-quarter that 
of light. The more powerful reac- 
tion engines would be used only 
once— to land on the target world. 
Maximum safe duration for the 
voyage would be one thousand 
years, so that their effective range 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



159 




was approximately two hundred 
and fifty light-years . 

It was a dream, Devlin knew, but 
he could not stop himself from 
dreaming again the shiver of awe 
and wonder he had felt then and his 
feeling of sympathy for the Brother, 
who, for some reason not yet plain, 
was unable to accompany them, 

. , Their course, according to 
the Brother, had been selected so 
as to make a close pass of ten 
target stars which were approxi- 
mately in a straight line within 
their two hundred and fifty light- 
year range. The majority of the 
solar systems concerned were 
thought to contain habitable 
planets, but the optical range was 
extreme and only a few might do 
so. Should the ship approach an 
unsuitable solar system it would 
use the gravity of the system’s sun 
to warp its course so as to direct it 
toward the next target system 
with no wastage of fuel. When a 
system with a suitable planet was 
found, the mission termination 
button would be pressed tind the 
ship’s computer would take them 
into pre-landing orbit and ulti- 
mately touchdown. 

It was at that point that 
Brother Howard diverged sharply 
from the early and more familiar 
lectures . 

XX 

“I have described, not for the 
first time, how you will go,” 
Brother Howard said briskly. 
“The reason why you are going is 
not so simple— and the reason why 



you people in particular are going 
is the most complicated of all. 

“To you the reason for leaving 
this place must seem obvious,” he 
went on, dividing his attention 
between Patricia and Devlin. 
“This is a rotten, violent and 
overcrowded place and no sane 
person with a choice would want 
to live in it. The not so obvious 
reason is that you and all the rest 
of us are being acted on by 
steadily increasing sociological, 
cultural, moral and economic 
pressures— you name it and I can 
tell you exactly how you are 
being squeezed. It is therefore 
probable that you are leaving be- 
cause you have no choice!” 

His voice had risen steadily in 
volume and his eyes, Devlin 
thought, seemed to reflect a mix- 
ture of anger and confusion. The 
Brother had never looked or 
sounded as wild as this before and 
Devlin reminded himself that not 
all of the city’s madmen were 
Maxers or teenage citizens. 

“Let us go back to your ana- 
logy of the fruit-bearing planet,” 
Brother Howard continued in a 
quieter voice. “The analogy is not 
perfect, as you know, because this 
planet-sized rotten fruit has no- 
where to fall in order to germinate 
and restart the growth cycle. In- 
stead it is being compressed on 
one side by rapidly diminishing 
resources and an exploding popu- 
lation on the other. The result will 
be that the seed contained within 
it will be expelled like a stone 
from a rotten plum— and the pur- 
pose of this project is to direct the 
seed toward fallow ground.”

He took a deep breath, then 
went on quietly, “Naturally we 
are making a big effort to ensure 
the success of our project. But we 
can never be sure of whether the 
effort and sacrifices are necessary 
or whether, if our particular group 
of talented people had stayed at 
home and enjoyed the various 
pleasures of our society, the pro- 
ject would have been launched by 
a completely different set of peo- 
ple using entirely different meth- 
ods. However, I am fully con- 
vinced that if something is des- 
tined to happen, then happen it 
will. Seeding must occur, and 
soon— I have special knowledge, 
you see, which makes me abso- 
lutely sure of this. I am also 
convinced, as are most of the 
others connected with the project, 
that God or Fate or the evolution- 
ary process helps those who help 
themselves. 

“Our main worry,” he added, 
and the worry was evident in his 
voice as well as in his expression, 
“is that we cannot know for sure 
whether we are helping or hinder- 
ing.” 

Devlin looked at Patricia, but 
all of her attention was on the 
Brother and there was no way of 
telling what she thought about 
this peculiar confession. 

“I wouldn’t dream of confusing 
and frightening you like this,” he 
continued, “if you were intended 
to remember this interview. How- 
ever, there is no need to be afraid 
for your physical well-being. The 
danger, the real suffering and con- 
fusion, will be mental rather than 
physical, and there is little we 

THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



have been able to do to prepare 
you for it. 

“But before 1 go into the de- 
tails of what we have done, and 
why, I shall try to dispel some of 
your present confusion by telling 
you how I became involved.” 

According to the Brother the 
project had its real beginning 
about a century and a half earlier 
when mankind, having slammed 
the door into space some forty 
years previously, was beginning to 
open it again and look outside. 
Scientific advances in the interim 
had provided methods of space 
travel that were much more eco- 
nomical than those of the first 
space age, as well as opening up 
the possibility of interstellar flight 
through the development of hiber- 
nation anesthesia techniques. 

One of the projects initiated at 
that time was aimed at sending a 
low-impulse drive ship containing 
a volunteer astronaut in cold sleep 
on a cometary orbit that would 
return it to the vicinity of Earth 
in one hundred and three years. 

But once again the public lost 
interest in space flight and in 
hibernation anesthesia, because 
even then the future promised to 
be an unpleasantly crowded and 
polluted and vicious place. Sensi- 
ble people preferred to live out 
their lives in the present rather 
than transferring a large portion 
of them into this rather frighten- 
ing future. But the volunteer 
astronaut, like most people who 
volunteered, was not very sensible 
and did not really think about the 
kind of Earth he would be return- 
ing to. Nor did he realize that, 

161 




while his physical condition upon 
resuscitation would be perfect, his 
mind would never be the same 
again. 

. A lot of time and effort 
and money had gone into the 
project, however,” Brother Ho- 
ward went on cynically, “and one 
of the project psychologists, 
Doctor Martin, was so interested 
that he undertook a longevity 
treatment in order to be around 
to see the end result. The treat- 
ment, although still experimental, 
was effective in that it conferred 
long life but not eternal youth. 

“Because Doctor Martin was 
not a normal person,” the Brother 
continued, “and because he was 
brilliant, dedicated and incredibly 
patient, he did not give up on the 
only cold sleeper to return after 
an extended period in space and 
gradually he coaxed him back to 
sanity. It required many, many 
years of constant attention be- 
cause the returned astronaut, by 
the generally accepted standards 
of the day, was hopelessly insane. 
In the long process of effecting a 
cure Doctor Martin discovered 
what exactly had been going on in 
the man’s mind while all of his 
bodily processes— except those of 
mentation, obviously— had been 
halted, and together with his 
patient they formulated theories 
to explain it. 

“But my return to sanity was 
not one hundred per cent com- 
plete,” the Brother added dryly. 
“As a result of those cold sleep 
experiences I became convinced 
that I had had my nose rubbed 
very firmly in a form of afterlife, 



and I’m afraid that I caught a 
severe dose of religion.” 

He looked from Patricia to Dev- 
lin, studying their expressions. 
Then he said, “Relax, I’m still not 
trying to convert you. But I must 
give you some idea of what to 
expect, so listen carefully . .” 

The Brother’s experience in 
cold sleep had been frightening, 
painful, stimulating and confus- 
ing, with confusion predomina- 
ting. He had been assured that 
nothing at all would happen dur- 
ing cold sleep and that he would 
be awakened without any appa- 
rent passage of time. Neither he 
nor the project medics had ex- 
pected him to dream, continu- 
ously and vividly, throughout his 
century -long voyage. 

Even the pleasant dreams had 
been frightening because of the 
confusion and disorientation 
caused by their apparently run- 
ning backward. Incidents were ex- 
perienced normally, but when he 
dreamed a person’s lifetime the 
incidents were not in chronolo- 
gical order. He would dream a 
person’s entire life-history, com- 
plete in every thought and detail 
and feeling and then, without 
warning, find himself the same 
person’s infant father an instant- 
after the aged son had died. 

He kept dreaming farther and 
farther back in time, of people 
and places about which he could 
not possibly have had knowledge. 
The dream lives became shorter 
and more violent. Some of them 
did not even involve human be- 
ings. And when he was resusci- 
tated his mind was filled with the 



162 



GALAXY 




pains, pleasures and confusion of 
countless lifetimes and he was 
incapable of forgetting • any of 
them. 

All of the lives and, more im- 
portant, all of the deaths were 
there as fresh in his memory as if 
they had happened only a few 
minutes earlier. 

It was a miracle that old Dr. 
Martin, who had been young Dr. 
Martin when Howard had been 
cooled for the trip, had been able 
to return him to any semblance of 
sanity. But the psychologist had 
managed it, in part, by providing 
an explanation for what had hap- 
pened to him. 

Martin had suggested that when 
a man— or men and/or women— 
were removed from their home 
planet for extended periods of 
time while being subjected to re- 
duced temperatures a process oc- 
curred which had the effect of 
making them seeds— or potential 
seeds of their race. The process 
was psycho-philosophical rather 
than physical. 

Like certain plant seeds and 
bacteria which were capable of 
surviving for extended periods in 
Arctic conditions and then of 
reproducing themselves, the hu- 
man equivalents were perfectly 
preserved in cold sleep, with none 
of their functions impaired. A 
major difference was that the hu- 
man seedlings possessed minds 
and these, apparently, were even 
more important and deserving of 
preservation. But it was not sim- 
ply the minds of the individuals 
concerned that were preserved, 
the process triggered off by time 



and reduced temperature had the 
effect of stimulating what 
amounted to the racial memory. 

The cold sleepers became the 
seeds of humanity-all of its 
knowledge, experience and 
achievements since its earliest be- 
ginnings. 

“In effect,” the Brother went 
on, unable to hide the wonder and 
excitement he was feeling, “each 
man arid woman has available to 
himself/herself the memories— 
that is the total knowledge and 
experience— of every ancestor of 
the same sex, and this would in- 
clude experiences these ancestors 
shared with contemporaries with 
whom they came into contact as 
far back as prehistoric times. Such 
memories could not be passed 
from male parent to male off- 
spring, or female to female as the 
case might be. The dream material 
made available during cold sleep 
comprises complete lifetimes. If 
racial memories were inherited 
from the parents they would be- 
gin at conception but no memory 
belonging to a parent would be- 
come similarly available to descen- 
dants after the birth of the final 
offspring. 

“Obviously there is a sex link- 
otherwise why couldn’t males ex- 
perience female dreams and vice 
versa? But according to the doctor 
there is another and much more 
important process at work. This is 
the release of information re- 
corded and stored in the large 
unused portion of the human 
brain, which is the mental com- 
ponent of the human seedling. 
Since the brain is the only organ 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



163 




in the human body that grows 
without regenerating itself, this 
explains why complete lifetimes 
can be remembered. 

“The reason for dreaming 
about people who could not pos- 
sibly be ancestors is more difficult 
to explain, but Dr. Martin has 
covered even that ...” 

One of the psychologist’s pet 
theories as a young man had dealt 
with ghosts and similar nonma- 
terial sound-sight-touch manifesta- 
tions. He had become convinced 
that ghosts did not exist, but he 
did believe that when an event 
involved considerable amounts of 
human pain, pleasure, fear or any 
other strong emotion, the asso- 
ciated mental radiation was ab- 
sorbed by material in the area 
—which would later become the 
scene of the so-called hauntings— 
and would be made available to 
anyone who visited the place later 
and who was sufficiently sensitive 
to be a receiver for the playback. 

When the Brother had reported 
on his dream lives experienced 
during a century of cold sleep, Dr. 
Martin had extended and modi- 
fied his theory. 

According to the psychologist, 
mental radiation was absorbed 
and recorded by all forms of 
organic life and the recording 
equipment increased its sensitivity 
and efficiency as the organic life 
in question developed intelligence. 
No thought or sensory impression, 
no matter how faint or distant in 
time was ever completely lost. It 
was stored, not in the crude, 
electro-chemical fashion used by 
the conscious mind, but on a 



sub-molecular level which enabled 
it to accommodate the vast quan- 
tity of material necessary for the 
retention of a racial memory. 

Martin held that any given per- 
son was composed of atoms or 
molecules— the organic building 
blocks-which in the recent or 
distant past had belonged to the 
structure of another person or had 
been briefly in contact with 
another person’s organic material 
through ingestion or assimilation 
into the tissues. The transfer of 
information to the hyper-sensitive 
recorder in the brain might even 
have occurred through inhalation 
of impurities while sharing public 
transport, possibly even through 
communal proximity. 

Martin had been unable to esta- 
blish either the degree of sensiti- 
vity or the range of the racial 
memory recording units in 
Brother Howard’s brain, but he 
had concluded it was not limitless. 

“To express it as simply as 
possible,” the Brother concluded, 
“no single person is carrying all of 
mankind’s history in his after- 
brain. But the ship will contain 
two hundred long-term cold- 
sleepers and the doctor is con- 
vinced that half that number, con- 
sidering the present-day mixing of 
racial types, would among them 
take away a record of every 
thought, emotion or sensation 
ever experienced by thinking crea- 
tures on this planet.” 

A long, uneasy silence fell after 
the Brother finished speaking. 
DevUn felt excited and impressed 
by the scope of the psychologist’s 
concept, but he still thought it 



164 



GALAXY 




incredible. Patricia must have 
been thinking along the same 
lines. 

“I can’t believe— all that,” she 
said apologetically but firmly. 

“Not now, naturally,” said the 
Brother. His voice held a tinge of 
compassion. “After your third or 
fourth awakening you will believe, 
except that our conditioning will 
keep you from remembering this 
particular session. By now you are 
realizing that if you were allowed 
to remember this you, and all the 
other colonists, would resign from 
the project.” 

Devlin laughed politely. He 
said, “In a project as important as 
this, one with so many philo- 
sophical implications, I still don’t 
know how you can be sure that 
you’re picking the right seeds for 
your pod.” 

“The simple answer,” replied 
the Brother, “is that we are not 
sure.” 

“Oh,” said Devlin. 

Brother Howard shook his 
head. “We are caterpillars trying 
to think like butterflies. The proc- 
ess of seeding may be as natural 
an event as the sun’s coming up, 
but in this case it is still an event 
that requires the combined know- 
ledge of all the hard and soft 
sciences. Doctor Martin and my- 
self are responsible for selecting 
the seed. A lot of time and effort 
has gone into the design and 
construction of your ship and we 
know it will work— but the busi- 
ness of seed selection is scaring us 
sick. 

“A seed should be capable of 
survival,” he went on. “Fine. But 



do we select our most aggressive, 
adaptable seedlings who will esta- 
blish a bridgehead and hold it 
against all comers? Or will we 
export our philosopher and artist 
seeds who between them may be 
incapable of growing a potato? Or 
a mixture of both which might 
result in the seeds destroying each 
other? All this is an over-simplifi- 
cation, you realize, but you can 
appreciate our dilemma. Finally 
we decided to take the easy— and 
perhaps cowardly— way out. We 
felt that if the seeding were truly 
to become an event as natural as 
childbearing the seeds themselves 
should be aware of the process. So 
we began to look around for 
personality types who were trying 
to expel themselves or who 
wanted to be expelled. We found 
that the strong-minded, aggressive, 
highly intelligent and resourceful 
men and women, the kind who to 
our minds would have made the 
best colonists, had adapted to 
present-day society and, under 
deep probing, were not really in- 
terested in going. 

“The group who really hated 
Earth and who desperately 
wanted to escape comprised more 
than ninety per cent of the 
world’s population,” he con- 
cluded. “That’s right— the sheep! 
We didn’t even have to go outside 
the city to find enough candi- 
dates.” 

After a moment’s silence 
Patricia said quietly, “That sounds 
like the right choice. Ordinary, 
average, peace-loving people are in 
the majority. They always have 
been.” 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



165 




“Yes,” replied the Brother. 
“The highly intelligent and aggres- 
sive types are responsible for 
much progress, but it has been 
progress without stability. The 
sheep will move ahead more 
slowly and evenly— as long as they 
don’t land among wolves.” 

“I see,” said Devlin, then 
added: “Don’t worry. I, too, 
think you made the right choice.” 

“Kind of you to say so,” said 
the Brother dryly. “Another 
worry has been how you people as 
individuals will react to becoming 
the repositories of this store of 
racial experience. From first-hand 
knowledge I can assure you that 
the process is anything but plea- 
sant, and we have tried to devise 
ways of cushioning the psychic 
shock involved. 

“Perhaps,” he said, going off on 
a tangent, “a voyage on a genera- 
tion-ship, with the original person- 
nel and their descendants living 
out their lives naturally during the 
trip and sleeping normally instead 
of going cold, would be easier on 
all concerned. Maybe that is the 
way seeding is supposed to hap- 
pen. But we can’t be sure— and 
anyway, we haven’t technical 
ability or the psychological con- 
trol capability to produce that 
kind of seed pod. All we can do is 
to try and make the cold dreams a 
little easier for you to take. 

“During the training sessions 
that you will be allowed to re- 
member we have told you lies, 
half-truths and generally planted 
impressions that are nothing but 
red herrings. Four periodic 
awakenings to reinforce and exer- 



cise the mind and body, for in- 
stance, are a case in point— re- 
membering will never be a prob- 
lem where you are concerned. 
Hints dropped about the necessity 
of dreaming, when you will not be 
able to stop doing it are another 
—as are oblique references to the 
use of new psycho-drugs that will 
make you suspect that the whole 
business is simply an elaborate 
simulation. All this lying and mis- 
direction has been to enable you 
to assimilate the sharp and intense 
and extremely confusing race 
memory data without its driving 
you insane.” 

Devlin nodded. He no longer 
thought the Brother a religious 
fanatic, but neither did he feel 
particularly reassured. He said, 
“Surely there are drugs available 
that would cushion these shocks. 
They could be injected immedi- 
ately preceding the awakening and 
they would dull the initial sensa- 
tions so that—” 

“No!” said the Brother sharply. 
“The seed pod is a product of the 
race’s technological achieve- 
ments— but the seeds themselves 
we are afraid to touch in case we 
adversely affect them. Drugs 
might deteriorate over such a 
lengthy period or have a damaging 
effect on the recall process. So 
you are going out untouched, 
medically speaking. The condi- 
tioning process, which we will 
begin shortly, is psychological and 
aimed at controlling your dream 
recall by non-material means. It is 
being done so that you will re- 
member, or dream, the earliest 
episodes first and so that the 



166 



GALAXY 




racial memory material will be 
presented more slowly and in 
chronological order. We .hope that 
the conditioning will prevent all 
of your racial memories’ being 
made available during your first 
cooldown— and that it will enable 
you to retain your sanity after the 
later awakenings. But we can’t, of 
course, be sure of anything.” 

Another long silence was again 
broken by Patricia, who said, “We 
both knew that there would be 
risks.” 

“Yes,” said Devlin, wishing that 
he could feel as calm as she 
sounded. “You had us worried for 
a while— we thought we’d fallen 
among religious fanatics. I realize 
now that while this thing has all 
sorts of philosophical implications 
it has nothing to do with religion 
or the afterlife.” 

“No?” 

“Not for me— not now,” replied 
Devlin. “Of course, I may not 
have thought deeply enough 
about it.” 

“You haven’t,” said the 
Brother, “and I’ll admit that in 
the objective sense I may not have 
undergone a religious experience. 
Much depends on your point of 
view and on how your parents 
brought you up to regard such 
things. I found that my after-brain 
recorder had been switched on 
and its return to Earth gravity and 
temperature did not seem to be 
switching it off. I kept assimi- 
lating impressions from everyone 
around me. So I became very 
understanding. 

“Mostly, though, I kept remem-' 
bering the lives of people who had 



died long ago. They were a pretty 
varied bunch, with good qualities 
and bad qualities in combinations 
that made their lives quite recall- 
able. They are all here, complete 
in every thought and feeling.” He 
tapped the side of his head, added 
seriously: “Everybody suffers— 

but nobody dies.” 

“But surely,” protested Devlin, 
“they are only the memories of 
people, not the people them- 
selves.” 

The Brother shook his head. He 
said, “Think of it in this way. 
When you go to sleep at night 
your life is switched off— you die. 
When you wake in the morning 
you may clearly remember your 
life of yesterday, but it is only a 
memory. You will better under- 
stand what I’m talking about 
when you have experienced your 
first few cold sleep memories. My 
point is that everyone who was 
ever alive will still be living in the 
minds of you colonists— and as for 
the religious implications—” He 
paused for a moment as the door 
opened and Dr. Martin came in. 
Then Howard went on: “I have a 
purely personal view regarding the 
meaning of my racial memories, 
you understand, and it’s one 
Doctor Martin does not agree 
with. The vast majority of these 
lives are recallable because there is 
much in them that is interesting 
and valuable. But there are other 
lives which are so twisted, so 
violent and unpleasant in one re- 
spect or another, that nobody 
would want to recall them even in 
part. So there is this mass of 
material that will rarely, if ever, 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



167 




be recalled. It belongs to people 
condemned— by their own acts, 
you will say, and not by any 
higher authority— to the outer 
darkness of the forgotten— to 
Limbo. As far as I am concerned 
the religious implications are 
clear.” 

Dr. Martin rolled his chair be- 
hind the desk, and the Brother 
stood up and solemnly shook 
hands with Patricia and Devlin. He 
smiled and said, “The doctor here 
describes me as a lapsed atheist, 
whatever that means. However, 
now I have to tell you that, 
following this conditioning ses- 
sion, you will be cooled and 
stored to await transfer to the 
ship. We will not meet again— and 
I want to wish both of you good 
luck and a safe landing.” 

As he turned to leave, Devlin 
said, “Wait, Brother. I’m still too 
confused by all this to say thank 
you and really mean it. But I still 
think it unfair that you people, 
who have done all the real work, 
have no chance of getting away. 
Surely we could make room, or 
do something to—” 

Brother Howard held up his 
hand. 

“With the problems you are 
shortly going to face, Doctor,” he 
said dryly, “trust you to worry 
about us! But there is one thing, 
just one, you can do: remember 
us in your dreams.” 

XXI 

T HERE were no colonist or crew 
awakenings while the ship killed 
its tremendous cruising velocity and 



began the return to Target Nine, so 
there was plenty of time to remem- 
ber and dream. The dreams were as 
vivid and complete as before, but 
now Devlin was aware of what was 
happening and was able to integrate 
them with his own memories and no 
longer felt helplessly imprisoned by 
them, as in a nightmare. 

He became more and more unse- 
lective regarding the material avail- 
able to him. He learned that pain as 
well as pleasure were a part of every 
worthwhile life and recalled people 
who were truly great to everyone but 
themselves and others whose great- 
ness was known only to a few close 
friends, or perhaps to only one other 
person. He also learned that very few 
lives were uninteresting or unworthy 
of remembrance and even fewer com- 
pletely valueless. 

To understand all was to forgive 
almost all, and Devlin’s understand- 
ing— or his education, as the Brother 
had described it at a time when he 
did not know what was involved— 
was complete. 

He brought back people he had 
met in his own lifetime— colleagues at 
Sanator Five, young Tommy Bennett 
and his father, Patricia’s father, Dr. 
Martin and Brother Howard. He had 
met them briefly or for extended 
periods of time, but everything they 
had thought and felt until that point 
in their lifetimes had made an im- 
pression on his after-brain and was 
available for replay. Each of them 
lived again in his memory, their 
beings so sharp and vivid and utterly 
complete that they lived, period. 

He could understand the Brother’s 
point of view about an afterlife, as 
well as many other things.

GALAXY 




Devlin was Brother Howard as an 
infant, a toddler, a young man rebell- 
ing against the constraints of highly 
moral parents who in their turn were 
overreacting against the increasing 
permissiveness of their society. He 
was Howard as a test pilot and an 
astronaut under training; as Howard 
had walked the awful emptiness of 
Mars; as a helpless cold sleeper reliv- 
ing, in savage and confusing detail, 
some of the lives that made up the 
race’s memory. 

He was Brother Howard when 
they had first met in the house of 
Bennett, a project worker and when 
Howard had decided that the doctor 
and probably his girl friend, would 
qualify for the mission. As Howard, 
Devlin had decided that all of the 
others would qualify, because he 
alone on Earth had the ability to 
know a man completely. He had 
been responsible for the selection of 
all the male project personnel and 
colonists while Dr. Martin, using 
more mundane methods, had been 
responsible for the screening of 
females. 

As Brother Howard, Devlin was 
aware of seeing himself as another 
had seen him and of the peculiar 
mental double-image that was his 
own recollection of his past life 
superimposed on the one detected by 
the Brother. 

But the subjects for Devlin’s recall 
included Howard’s contacts on the 
project, men who knew the workings 
of the ship inside out and from 
preliminary design sketch to finished 
and tested hardware. Devlin knew he 
was only a seed in a fantastically 
sophisticated metal pod and that the 
pod was beginning to deteriorate 



seriously. He thought that it should 
be possible for the seeds to help 
sustain their own aging and withering 
pod . 

He was still investigating that pos- 
sibility when he was awakened. 

GOOD MORNING DEVLIN. SHIP 
STATUS ONE THOUSAND AND THREE 
YEARS INTO MISSION. SYSTEMS 
AND/OR BACKUP SYSTEMS FUNC- 
TIONING AT LEVELS ADEQUATE FOR 
INSERTION INTO PRE-LANDING 
ORBIT. SHIP PERSONNEL CUR- 
RENTLY AWAKE-TWO. IDENTITIES 
PATRICIA MORLEY AND JOHN DEV- 
LIN. 

T HERE were no further messages 
on the display, Devlin noted as 
he began exercising. Patricia had said 
that she would erase the useless 
reminders about exercising and re- 
membering as a means of saving 
ship’s power. But the single message 
had told him enough, and his im- 
patience made him complete the 
exercises while on the way to the 
control center. Patricia, who must 
have been fractionally less impatient, 
arrived there a few seconds later. 

With fast, expert movements they 
called for the situation report and 
read that the ship was closing the 
target planet and estimated just 
under five days to pre-landing orbit 
insertion. All four of the mission 
termination probes, the most highly 
sensitive and complex the ship had 
available, had already been launched. 
One had taken up a surveillance orbit 
and was transmitting data on all 
channels. Another had developed a 
control malfunction while attempt- 
ing a soft landing and had gone down

hard. The other two had been too 
sick to leave the launching tubes. 

The ship itself was not sick, just 
very, very tired. Even so it declared 
itself capable of landing them safely 
on their new home. 

“Not an ideal home,” said Patricia, 
following his train of thought, “even 
if we don’t fall into a clump of 
thorns.” She gestured toward the 
surveillance probe’s display and 
asked, “Shall I look for a few less 
thorny spots?” 

Devlin shook his head. “Not yet, if 
you don’t mind. Will you help me 
with the ship’s personnel status 
board? At last report there were 
twenty-three cold-sleepers in mal- 
functioning cubicles which, while 
capable of preserving them, were no 
longer able to complete resuscitation 
procedure. I’ve been thinking about 
that problem and dreaming some of 
the people who might have been able 
to solve it.” 

“Me, too,” said Patricia. “Some of 
the engineers were brilliant girls, but 
they would have needed a lot of 
skilled help, special equipment and a 
lot longer than five days to put it 
right-” 

She broke off as the display an- 
nounced that seventy-eight of the 
two hundred-odd remaining sleepers 
were likely to stay in that condition 
permanently. 

D EVLIN stared disbelievingly at 
the figures, his mind reacting to 
the disaster they represented. 

He asked pleadingly, “Is there no 
chance of repairing the faulty resusci- 
tation equipment? No chance at ail?” 
“We know what to do,” said 
Patricia gently, “and perhaps if we 



resuscitated enough of the other 
sleepers, they might have dreamed 
enough about the project personnel 
to recall what must be done. But 
they were not aware of the problem, 
remember, and would only dream 
about the project by sheer luck. Too, 
we don’t have the time or the special 
equipment needed for the job. You 
know that, don’t you?” 

“I know it,” said Devlin. “I was 
just hoping you would come up with 
an idea.” 

In a kind of agony he thought of 
the people who would die as soon as 
the ship landed and the slow, uncon- 
trolled warmth of the planetary at- 
mosphere began to seep into the 
ship’s space-cold interior. At present 
they were in cold sleep, not techni- 
cally alive but still dreaming lifetimes 
and experiences not their own— so 
neither were they dead. Was it right 
that he should condemn them to 
death— and lose so much of his race’s 
memory and experience— by landing 
on this world? Would it not be better 
to use the last of the ship’s pro- 
pulsive power to shoot it out again 
into interstellar space, where the cold 
would ultimately allow everyone to 
dream forever about all the people 
who individually had made up the 
race of man? 

Would it not be better to be a seed 
that was complete and perfect and 
never fell to ground, then one that 
was weakened, incomplete and prob- 
ably destined to die before germina- 
tion? 

“No,” said Patricia firmly. “Before 
you could take that decision you 
would have to resuscitate everyone 
and ask for a vote. You would have 
to do that.” 



170 



GALAXY 




Devlin had not been aware that he 
had been thinking aloud. He said 
angrily, “We won’t be able to count 
seventy-eight of the votes— remem- 
ber? What would you have me do 
about that?” 

“I don’t know,” she replied fur- 
iously, “any better than you do. But 
you could put two of them in the 
cubicles belonging to Miss Caldwell 
and Purdy. Those cubicles were 
switched off to conserve power, re- 
member. They weren’t mal- 
functions-” 

She broke off to stare at him while 
he stared just as wildly at her. 

They had the answer. v 

Cautiously, Devlin said, “Do you 
think we can manage it in just five 
days? There are seventy-eight of 
them, after all.” 

“But we’ll have help,” Patricia 
replied excitedly. “If necessary we 
can warm as many of the others as 
we need to help with the transfers. It 
will be very congested towards the 
end and the voyage-only consum- 
ables will probably run out, but it 
should work.” 

“Yes,” said Devlin. 

He watched her excitement fade as 
she, too, realized that they had 
solved just one— the least impor- 
tant— of their two problems. With the 
exception of Yvonne Caldwell and 
Thomas Purdy their metal pod would 
arrive with its full complement of 
seedlings. But they still had to decide 
on a landing site; which particular 
area was least densely overgrown 
with thorns. 

The picture from the surveillance 
probe, which was capable of virtually 
unlimited magnification, filled the 
main display screen. 



“Let’s deal with one problem at a 
time,” he said. Then, seeing her 
disapproving expression, he added 
apologetically: “Despite my exten- 
sive education and everything, I 
haven’t changed very much— I still 
try to put off things.” 

“Yes,” she said and smiled. “And I 
still seem to be a nag.” 

F OR the next two days they were 
kept busy resuscitating cold 
sleepers, explaining the situation to 
them and helping them move the 
people in malfunctioning caskets into 
those that were still working and 
lately vacated by other colonists. The 
solution had been simple and perhaps 
obvious. By warming up the occu- 
pants of functioning caskets, then 
initiating a cooldown with the casket 
empty, the people who had been 
cooled with no hope of resuscitation 
could then be moved to functioning 
caskets and warmed in the ordinary 
way. Care had to be taken to make 
sure that a partial, and lethal, warm- 
up did not take place during the 
transfer and even more care was 
needed to avoid injury to their ultra- 
frigid and brittle bodies. But once 
the steadily increasing number of 
helpers understood what was re- 
quired there was little for Patricia 
and Devlin to do except stay in the 
control center and prepare for the 
landing. 

“The latest estimate is that every- 
one will be warm at re-entry minus 
six hours,” said Patricia. “The drain 
on consumables will be considerable, 
so we can all expect to be very 
hungry— but not enough to weaken 
us physically. All ship’s personnel, 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM

with the exception of ourselves, will 
take landing deceleration in their 
caskets, and their displays will keep 
them informed of what is going on 
here. People in malfunctioning cubi- 
cles will be in the dark, in both 
senses of the word, and very cold— 
they will have to borrow a couple of 
sets of coveralls each if the cubicle 
heaters are also out. The post-landing 
food supply and food synthesizers, 
seeds, livestock breeders, agricultural 
and construction machinery have 
been checked. The automatic unlock- 
ing systems are functioning and will 
open these supplies to us as soon as 
we touch down. 

“I wonder,” she ended worriedly, 
‘‘if we will be given the chance to eat 
a hearty meal before—” 

“Several, I should think,” said 
Devlin reassuringly. “Especially if we 
land in the middle of nowhere.” 

Patricia smiled and said, “Let’s try 
to find nowhere.” 



T HE post-landing food supply and 
equipment, designed to enable 
them to survive for at least two 
months while they established a base 
and set up the tissue and plant 
synthesizers, which would further 
extend their reserves until the first 
crops came in, had been locked away 
during the voyage for obvious rea- 
sons. He wondered, remembering his 
first experience with the pallid, pear- 
shaped, spindly and highly aggressive 
aliens, whether a self-guiding nuclear 
weed-killer would put an abrupt stop 
to their first celebration dinner on 
the new world. 

They were here first, he thought 
despairingly, and we would not tres- 



pass if we had any other choice. But 
could the aliens believe that? Was 
there any chance of communicating 
with them and making them under- 
stand? 

There was not enough time to do 
it from orbit and by the time they 
were down the natives would already 
have made their decision. There was 
nothing to do but set down in one of 
the least densely populated areas and 
hope that they would not be noticed 
until they were able to work out 
some method of communication or, 
he thought bitterly, a few of the 
sheep grew fangs. 

He was remembering Hawn and 
the young King and the millions of 
others who had learned how to sur- 
vive amid violence and whose know- 
ledge was instantly available should 
the colonists need it. But were they 
capable of using such knowledge? 
And if they did use it, would they 
ever again be able to think of them- 
selves as sheep? 

Would the meek, he wondered 
bitterly, ever inherit anything? 

In silence they called up the re- 
cordings of their original fly-by, com- 
paring them with current views of 
the same planetary area. It was im- 
mediately obvious that the world had 
an awful lot of usable empty space, 
that there had been no major build- 
ing or expansion programs and that 
the colony had suffered something 
less than a population explosion. 
Radiation sensor data comparisons 
still showed minor emission, chiefly 
on the communication frequencies, 
from the widely scattered housing, 
and unmistakable evidence of nuclear 
technology in the towns, which were 
obviously the manufacturing centers 



172

for the colony world. 

“It isn’t exactly an expanding 
colony,” said Devlin, .rubbing his 
eyes. They had been staring at dis- 
plays for nearly three hours. He 
added, “I wonder if the planet is 
only marginally suited to their form 
of life— as it is to ours. Maybe there 
are trace elements in the atmosphere 
that are toxic to them or the heavier 
gravity makes it difficult to have 
children—” 

“Then we must look for nurseries 
and schools,” she said quickly. “Any 
place likely to contain children. Even 
with a totally strange life form you 
should be able to tell if the children 
are healthy.” 

“Yes, indeed,” said Devlin and 
tapped for maximum magnification 
from the probe’s visual sensors. To- 
gether they concentrated on holding 
the images steady, swearing when 
heat eddies distorted the pictures or 
the guidance went slightly off to 
leave them staring at an uninteresting 
expanse of roofing. They saw many 
natives, foreshortened except when 
they were lying down, of all sizes. 
They were unable to find any struc- 
ture remotely resembling a school— at 
least, they could not recognize it as 
such if they did see one. There 
seemed to be young ones in the 
streets with parents, playing on the 
beaches. All of them appeared to be 
healthy and very active. 

“There isn’t anything wrong with 
that lot.” Patricia was frowning. 
“But I wouldn’t say the same for 
their parents— they are, well, negli- 
gent! Some of those children are very 
small, little more than infants, and 
they are playing unattended on a 
dangerous stretch of beach. There 



should be an adult there to tell them 
that . .” 

“Maybe,” said Devlin, laughing 
suddenly, “they don’t need to be 
told.” 

All at once he was feeling great, 
better than he could remember feel- 
ing in any of his lives. He still was 
not sure that every tiling was going to 
be all right. 

“What’s the matter with you—” 
began Patricia, giving him a frighten- 
ed look. Before he could reassure 
her regarding his sanity, a red light 
began winking for attention and the 
image they had been studying 
blanked out and was replaced by a 
printed message. 

FLY-BY NINE ORIGINAL SOFT- 
LANDED PROBE MALFUNCTION COR- 
RECTED, PROBE SENSORS REACTI- 
VATED. TRANSMITTING. 

D EVLIN said quietly, “They 
found the first damaged probe 
and repaired it. I thought that it 
would be impossible to communicate 
with them from space, considering 
the difficulty of matching fre- 
quencies and the other technical 
problems. But they took the easy 
way out. They studied, repaired and 
used our own equipment and I’m 
betting that they were able to build a 
receiver as well as repair our trans- 
mitter. But now we need a fix on 
their incoming signal,” he added, “if 
we’re going to send as well as re- 
ceive.” 

Patricia nodded and began tapping 
instructions, still looking confused 
and worried. Devlin called up the 
data arriving from the repaired probe 
and angled a vision pickup to cover 
both their couches. 



THE DREAM MILLENNIUM 



173 




The picture showed a large room 
with two windows. It was dark out- 
side. The walls of the room were 
covered with large charts and simple 
line drawings, display screens and 
associated equipment at least as 
sophisticated as that in the control 
center. Three adult aliens were 
watching the probe’s vision pickup 
and the displays, and two of the 
screens lit suddenly with a picture of 
Patricia and himself lying in their 
control couches. The excitement in 
the room was plain to see. 

This is the first time they have 
seen human beings, thought Devlin. 
He had seen their species during the 
near-catastrophic fly-by of Target 
Five, but at that time the progenitors 
of the beings on this world must 
already have left their home system. 

“The transmission is coming from 
an area on the night side,” said 
Patricia, who had been dividing her 
attention between the main and a 
side display. “I’ve called up the 
visuals recorded during a daylight 
pass and magnified them. The area is 
several hundred miles from the near- 
est town, a clearing in a well-wooded 
valley, with a few small buildings and 
a large, steerable dish antenna in it. 
The interior of the dish is highly 
reflective. There are surface power 
lines, apparently, radiating from the 
installation, and one of them goes to 
a similar dish about twelve miles 
distant—” 

“Look at this,” said Devlin. 

The vision pickup on the surface 
was being directed toward a large and 
simplified drawing of Five’s solar 
system, with a smaller drawing of an 
alien placed above the home planet. 
The pickup lingered for a few min- 



utes on that drawing before moving 
to another, which showed a spherical 
ship, also with a picture of an alien 
close to it, leaving the home system 
and passing several representations of 
stars before arriving at system Nine. 

“Those charts and that whole in- 
stallation,” said Patricia worriedly, 
“were not put together overnight. 
They have been expecting us. At 
least, they must have decided that 
there was a strong chance that we 
would be back and— and— ” 

“Yes,” said Devlin, readying the 
white plastic boards and stylus which 
were available for just this contin- 
gency. “But they don’t know any- 
thing about us. I wish I could draw.” 



N evertheless he produced a 

recognizable if crudely executed 
sketch of the Earth’s solar system 
with a stylized man above the third 
planet, and presented it to the con- 
trol center pickup. On the surface 
there were more signs of excitement 
and he followed with a sketch of his 
ship leaving Earth’s system and com- 
ing to Nine, the only difference 
between it and the aliens’ drawing 
being the human figure above the 
ship and the number of intervening 
stars. The excitement below became 
intense, then suddenly they all be- 
came very still as the surface pickup 
was directed at another drawing. 

It showed a stylized alien lying 
recumbent and slightly off-center on 
an otherwise blank sheet. 

Eagerly Devlin began to sketch 
again. He copied as best he could the 
picture of the recumbent and off- 
center alien, then added a stylized 
and recumbent man beside it and 



174 



GALAXY 




presented the drawing for viewing. 

Their reaction beggared descrip- 
tion. It was just possible that the 
aliens were waving their double- 
handed arms at him in anger, but he 
did not think so. 

He said, “I think that was the right 
answer.” 

“But what was it?” asked Patricia. 
“A representation of the lion lying 
down with the lamb?” 

“You’re partly right,” said Devlin 
seriously. “What they were asking, 
and what I hope I told them, was 
that we, too, experienced a lot while 
we were on our way here. That we 
are not afraid to lie down unpro- 
tected beside them and exchange, if 
such a process is possible, our respec- 
tive racial memories while we are 
asleep. Most of all I think I was 
telling them that we, too, are sheep.” 

D URING the fly-by of Five the 
aliens’ reaction had frightened 
him so much that he had not been 
able to use his brain properly. They 
had been so aggressive, so wildly and 
violently antagonistic, that he had 
only briefly considered the possibi- 
lity that there might have been peo- 
ple on that world like Brother Ho- 
ward, Dr. Martin and the other dedi- 
cated members of the project. Per- 
haps an alien vessel passing too close 
to Sol a few decades after the colo- 
nists had left would have found the 
humans degenerated even further 
than in his own day, become even 
more violent, and reacting in exactly 
the same fashion as had the people 
on Five’s planet. But now he had 
begun to think. 

He thought about the absence of 



schools and of what it would be like 
to have children educated, from a 
very early age, by dreams which 
stretched beyond their race’s earliest 
recorded history. He thought of a 
non-human race sharing a world with 
his own people, perhaps sharing their 
racial dreams, and of what they 
might ultimately achieve together. 
They were unlikely to do anything 
violently or in a hurry, because the 
evidence was that the aliens had 
made no attempt to grab territory or 
cover the planet with their offspring. 
But sometime in the distant future it 
would be seeding time again, and he 
was thinking like a caterpillar. In- 
stead he should be thinking like a 
sheep or, more accurately, a shep- 
herd. 

“Any time now,” he said confi- 
dently, “they should produce 
another sketch or make some kind of 
signal that they understand and 
are—” 

“They have,” said Patricia, point- 
ing to the other display. 

On the half of the world that was 
in darkness there was a tiny brilliant 
circle of lights that burned steadily 
while a larger beacon at the center 
winked on and off. The scaling grid 
showed that the circle of beacons 
was over twenty miles in diameter 
and that the aliens’ communications 
post was at its center. 

Devlin nodded. He said, “We will 
have to explain the situation to our 
people in the unpowered cubicles, 
which will take some time, so you 
may as well call up the landing 
program before we tell them the 
good news. 

“Put us down,” he added, “in the 
middle of the welcome mat.” *
