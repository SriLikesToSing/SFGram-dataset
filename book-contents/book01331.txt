Do you have a restless urge to write? 



If so, you have much in common 
with successful authors. 

Read how 1 2 Famous Writers are 
helping people turn a restless urge for 
self-expression into success in writing 



There's something different about people who 
feel the urge to write. They have a spiritual 
hunger that sets them apart — even from family 
and friends. 

If you have known this burning need to write, 
you, too, may have the gift successful authors 
possess ... the recurring ache to put into words 
your innermost thoughts, your own experiences. 

Max Shulman started writing because . it 
was write or bust.” Faith Baldwin, after 80 
novels, still says: “I’ve never written exactly 
what I dreamed I’d write . you keep on try- 
ing.” Successful authors like these know that 
this restless urge for self-expression is perhaps 
the most important ingredient of writing suc- 
cess. But, they realize it can waste away if you 
don’t know how to get started writing, or if you 
hesitate to try. 

Several years ago they joined forces with 
Rod Serling, Bennett Cerf, Bruce Catton, Mig- 
non G. Eberhart, John Caples, J. D. Ratcliff, 
Mark Wiseman, Rudolf Flesch, Red Smith and 
Bergen Evans, to form the Famous Writers 
School. They poured everything they knew 
about writing into a remarkable new kind of 
professional training course which trains you 
at home in your spare time. You begin with 
the fundamentals of all good writing — then 
specialize in Fiction, Non-Fiction, Advertising 
Writing or Business Writing. 

Each of your assignments is examined by an 
instructor who is a professional writer or editor. 
He goes over your work line by line, word by 
word, blue-penciling his changes right on your 
manuscript, much as an editor does with an 
established author. Then he returns it with a 
long letter of advice and guidance. 

This training works well. Our students have 
sold their writing to the Reader's Digest, 




Rod Serling s urge to write made him a 
leading TV dramatist {Twilight Zone, Patterns, 
Requiem for a Heavyweight) and won him 
six Emmy awards.

tion, and more than 100 other publications.

TOO MANY INPUTS 



A part from our strange primate 
habit of polluting our environ- 
ment by dirtying up our air and 
filthying up our water, we also have 
made great strides in polluting the 
environment of our senses. Consider 
the difference between a modem 
American (habitat and that of a 
medieval peasant. The peasant (who 
was, remember, the great bulk of 
humanity until just a few decades 
ago) lived in a world where the 
visual inputs were relatively famil- 
iar and relatively low-key ... in 
spring and summer, all greens and 
browns; in fall, a few reds and rus- 
sets; in winter, a blanket of white. 
Of the self-luminous visual objects 
in his universe, the only important 
one was the sun — occasionally the 
quiet moon and stars, rarely a flick- 
ering rush to give him light enough 
to go to bed by or the fire that 
cooked his dinner. His auditory in- 
puts were even milder — a few 
times a year he might hear a thun- 
derclap, but the rest of his life the 
sounds on his horizon were his own 
voice, the lowing of his cattle, the 
chopping of wood, the bells of the 
village church. 

But look at us today! Sights and 
sounds clamor for our attention 
from every quarter. We walk along 
a street in a city and cannot con- 
verse with the man walking next to 
us under a shout, because of traffic, 
construction, the rumble of a sub- 
way train under the street, the flut- 
ter of a helicopter overhead. The 



part of the country that most of 
us see is no better than the city — 
because in fact it is a part of the 
city, the linking pseudopods that one 
city extends to another in the form 
of throughways and turnpikes, with 
the vehicles moving three times as 
fast and generating nine times as 
much noise. Even away from the 
highways we have the jets and the 
piston -planes to assault our senses; 
and in our homes, offices and stores 
we have the sound of business 
machines, the chatter of talk, the 
ringing of bells, plus the filtering 
in of traffic, aircraft and construc- 
tion noises through tissue-thin walls 
... and to make sure the sound 
threshold is high enough, we add 
Muzak, radio, TV and recorded 
sounds. At 140 decibels physical 
damage results. Ordinary city traf- 
fic regularly hits 105 decibels or 
higher; when a jet passes overhead 
or a particularly loud truck goes by, 
the 140-decibel level comes perilous- 
ly close. 

But apart from the sheer volume 
and variety of sound and sight, 
there is a very high proportion of 
it deliberately structured for atten- 
tion-getting qualities — the savage 
noises of an aspirin commercial on 
television, the blare of a sound- 
truck at election time, dizzying neon, 
even the colors of the fabrics we 
wear and the goods we buy. High- 
intensity, saturated colors are al- 
most as much a modern invention as 
the machine-gun pop of the helicop-

/ter overhead; among the other tran- 
quil advantages of our peasant, his 
dyes and paints were almost as milt- 
ed as his environment, with butter- 
nut browns and saffron yellows and 
an occasional rare glimpse of a 
crushed mineral in oil paint. 

It's a fact that too many sensory 
inputs can cause damage to the 
mind. Apparently early exposure 
helps — while the brain is develop- 
ing, the experience of handling mul- 
tiple inputs prepares it for the task. 
But if the inputs increase too much 
after the brain is well formed they 
can lead to catastrophe. Example: 
Those who are blind from birth, 
and then have their sight restored 
in maturity^ almost invariably suf- 
fer from such acute depression that 
suicide is common. So maybe our 
children will be better able to cope 
with today's environment than we. 

As a matter of fact, the parent of 
any teen-ager can testify that the 
younger generation is thriving on 
a diet of prophylactic sound right 
now: witness the time when you 
hear a blast of noise from tbe teen- 
ager's room, and you race up there, 
and there he is, the TV going, the 
transistor shouting. “W-A-B-C- 
wangggg!” the record-player blar- 
ing, “FTin-chester Ca-t/ie-dral!" . 
and you ask him what the devil he's 
doing and he says, “Holy catfish, 
I'm doing my homework.'' 

But the trouble with that is that 
they will not be living in today's 
environment. They'll be living in 
tomorrow's. And if present trends 
are any indication, they will have 
noisier, more raucous, more strident 
inputs still. Look at the goodies in 
store for us ! Think only of the 
supersonic transport — spreading a 
path of sonic boom fifty miles wide, 
clear across the country, with every 



flight. Not to mention rockets. Not 
to mention what the advertising 
men of tomorrow may come up with 
. focused to bring commercials 
to us in our bedrooms, or — say, 
how about using smell ? 

W hat led us to these trains of 
thought is that, as this edi- 
torial is being written, we are in 
the second day of a fair-sized bliz- 
zard. Astonishing world! It's all 
white, even the air; all the man- 
made sounds are muted. In fact, 
the only sounds we consciously hear 
are as “white” as the snow — the 
hiss of steam in the heating system, 
the blowing of the wind. 

So, in line with our policy of let- 
ting our readers in on the ground 
floor of economic opportunity, let 
us now propose a new product to 
manufacture. It should muffle sound 
and sight equally; it should come 
in fluffy white flakes and stay sus- 
pended in the air, blotting out harsh 
colors and lights, sopping up the 
most raucous noises. We think it 
could be made out of some sort of 
light foam plastic, blown into the 
air out of slow-moving trucks. We 
haven't decided on a name for it — 
StyroSno? Snocron? Whatever it is, 
it should have the sexy modem 
sound of Coke or Citgo or Enovid. 

Because naturally we will want to 
advertise it. In fact, there's a real 
challenge for Mad Ave: to create 
the sort of advertising, gimmicks 
that will break right through the 
Snocron barrier, overwhelming its 
sound-deadening qualities with stac- 
cato shrieks and snaredrum tattoos, 
penetrating its curtain with — well, 
let's see. Laser beams? Nuclear ex- 
plosions? Never mind, we'll work 
that problem out somehow.

SPACEMAN! 

by KEITH LAUMER 



Illustrated by CASTELLON 



He was shanghaied onto a weird 
trip across the starways — and 
there would never be a return!

some mouldy leaves drifted there. I 

I remember hearing somewhere that used the last of my lighter fluid try- 
freezing to death is an easy way ing to get a little blaze going, but 

to go; but the guy that said that that turned out like everything else 

never tried it. I’d found myself a I’d tried lately. A fizzle. One thing 

little hollow where a falling-down about it: my feet were so numb from 
stone wall met a dirt -bank and hun- the cold. I couldn’t feel the blisters 

kered down in it; but the wall wasn’t from the eighteen miles I’d hiked 

high enough to keep the wind off since my last ride dumped me at a 

or stop the sleet from hitting my crossroads, just before dawn, 

neck like buckshot and running down I had my collar turned up, for

what good that might do, which 
wasn’t much; the coat felt like wet 
newspaper. Both elbows were out of 
it, and two of the buttons were gone. 
Funny. Three weeks ago it had been 
decent-looking enough to walk into 
a second-class restaurant without at- 
tracting more than the usual quota 
of hostile stares. Three weeks. That’s 
all it took to slide from a shaky toe- 
hold in the economic cycle all the 
way to the bottom. I’d heard of hit- 
ting the skids, but I never knew be- 
fore just what it meant. Once you 
go over that invisible edge, it’s down- 
hill all the way. 

It had been almost a year since 
I’d quit school, when Uncle Jason 
died. What money I had went for 
the cheapest funeral the little man 
with the sweet, sad smile could bear 
to talk about. After that, I’d held a 
couple of jobs that had wafted away 
like the morning mist as soon as the 
three-months “tryout” was over and 
the question of regular wages came 
up. There’d been a few months of 
scrounging, then; mowing lawns, run- 
ning errands, one-day stands as a 
carpenter’s helper or assistant bus- 
boy while the regular man was off. 
I’d tried to keep up appearances, 
enough not to scare off any pros- 
pective employers, but the money 
barely stretched to cover food and 
what the sign said was a clean bed. 

Then one day I’d showed up look- 
ing just a little too thin, a little too 
hungry, the collar just a little too 
frayed. 

And now I was here, with my 
stomach making whimpering sounds 
to remind me of all the meals • it 
hadn’t 'had laitely, as far as ever from 



where I was headed — wherever 
that was. I didn’t really have a des- 
tination. I just wanted to be where 
I wasn’t. 

And I couldn’t stay here. The wall 
was worse than no protection at all, 
and the wind was blowing colder and 
wetter all the time. I crawled out 
and made it back up the slope to the 
road. There were no headlights in 
sight; it wouldn’t have helped if there 
were. Nobody was going to stop in 
a sleetstorm in the middle of no- 
where to give a lift to a hobo like 
me. I didn’t have any little sign to 
hold up, stating that I was a hardship 
case, that comfortable middle-class 
conformity was my true vocation, 
that I was an honest young fellow 
with a year of college who’d had a 
little hard luck lately. All I had was 
the clothes I stood in, a bad cough 
and a deep conviction that if I didn’t 
get out of the weather, fast, by morn- 
ing I’d be one of those dead-of-ex- 
posure cases they’re always finding 
in alleys back of cut-rate liquor 
stores. 

I put my back to the wind and 
started off, hobbling on a couple of 
legs that ended somewhere below the 
knee. I didn’t notice feeling tired 
any more, or hungry. I was just a 
machine somebody had left running. 
All I could do was keep putting one 
foot in front of the other until I ran 
down. 

I saw the light when I came up over 
a rise, just a weak little spark, 
glowing a long way off in the bfg 
dark beyond the trees. I turned and 
started off across the open field 
toward it.

IF 




Ten minutes later, I came up be- 
hind a big swaybacked barn with a 
new-looking silo beside it and a ram- 
bling two-story house beyond. The 
light was shining from a ground floor 
window. There was a pickup parked 
in the side yard near the bam, and 
a late-model Cadillac convertible, 
with the top down. Just looking at 
it made me ten degrees colder. I 
didn’t have any idea of knocking 
on the door, introducing myself : 
“Billy Danger, sir. May I step inside 
and curl up in front of the fire?” — 
and being invited to belly up to a 
chicken dinner. But there was the 
barn. And where there were bams, 
there was hay; and where there was 
hay, a man could snuggle down and 
sleep, if not warm, at least not out 
in the freezing rain. It was worth 
a try. 

The barn door looked easy 
enough: just warped boards hanging 
on big rusted-out hinges; but when 
I tried it, nothing budged. I looked 
closer and saw that the hinges 
weren’t rotted after all; they were 
just made to look that way. I picked 
at a flake of paint on the door. There 
was bright metal underneath. 

That was kind of strange, but all 
it meant to me then was that I 
wouldn’t be crawling into that hay- 
stack after all. 

The sleet was coming down thick- 
er than ever now. I put my nose up 
and sniffed, caught a whiff of fry- 
ing bacon and coffee that made my 
jaws ache. All of a sudden, my stom- 
ach remembered its complaint and 
tried to tie itself into a hard knot. I 
went back through tall weeds past 
some rusty iron that used to be farm 



machinery, and across a rutted drive 
toward the silo. I didn’t know much 
about silos except that they were 
where you stored the corn, but at 
least it had walls and a roof. If I 
could get in there, I might find a 
dry spot to hide in. I reached a door 
set in the curved wall; it opened, and 
I slid inside, into dim light and a 
flow of warm air. 

Across the room, there was an 
inner door, standing open. I could 
see steps going up: glass steps on 
chrome-plated rails. The soft light 
and warm air were coming from 
there. 

I went up moving on instinct, 
like the first fish crawling out on 
land. I reached the top and was in 
a room full of -pipes and tubes and 
machinery and a smell like the in- 
side of a TV set. Weary as I was, 
this didn’t look like a place to curl 
up in. 

I made it up another turn of the 
spiral stair, came out in a space 
where big shapes like cotton bales 
were stacked, with dark spaces be- 
tween them. There was a smell like 
a fresh-tarred road here. I groped 
toward the deepest shadow I could 
find, and my hand touched some- 
thing soft. In the faint light from the 
stairwell it looked like mink or sable, 
except that it was an electric blue 
color. I didn’t let that worry me. I 
crawled up on top of the stack and 
put my face down in the velvety fluff 
and let all the strings break at once.

I n the dream, I was a burglar, holed 
up in somebody else’s house,

hiding in the closet, and in a minute 
they’d find me and haul me out and 
ride me into town in a police car to 
sit under the lights and answer ques- 
tions about every unsolved chicken- 
stealing in the county in the past 
five years. The feet were coming 
up the stairs, coming closer. Some- 
body said something, and a woman’s 
voice answered in a foreign language. 
They went away, and the dream 
faded .... 

. And then the noise started. 

It was a thin, high-pitched shrill- 
ing, like one of those whistles you 
call the dog with. It went right be- 
tween my bones and pried at the 
joints. It got louder, and angrier, like 
bees boiling out of a hive, and I 
was awake now, and trying to get 
up; but a big hand came down and 
mashed me flat. I tried to get 
enough breath in to yell, but the air 
had turned to syrup. I just had time 
to remember the day back in Pine- 
ville when the Chewy rolled off the 
rack at Uncle Jason’s gas station 
and pinned a man under the back 
bumper. Then it all went red, and I 
was someplace else, going over Nia- 
gara Falls in a big rubber balloon, 
wearing a cement life jacket. 

W hen I woke up, I heard voices. 

. talking rot now. It’s 
nothing to do with me.” This was 
a man’s voice, speaking with an 
English accent. He sounded as if 
he was a 'little amused by something. 

“I mark well t’was thee I charged 
with the integrity o’ the vessel!” This 
one sounded big and mad. He had 
a strange way of talking, but I could 
understand most of the words all 



right. Then a girl spoke, but in an- 
other language. She had a nice, clear, 
sweet voice. She sounded worried. 

“No harm done, Desroy.” The 
first man gave a soft laugh. “And 
it might be a spot of good luck, at 
that. Perhaps he’ll make a replace- 
ment for Jongo.” ' 

“I don’t omit thy ill-placed japery, 
Orfeo. Rid me this urchin, ere you 
vex me out of all humor!” 

“A bit of a sticky wicket, that, old 
boy. He’s still alive, you know. If 
I nurse him along — ” 

“How say you? What stuff is this! 
Art thou the parish comfort, to wax 
chirurgeonly o’er this whelp?” 

“If he can be trained — ” 

“You o’ertax my patience, Orfeo! 
I’d make a chough of as deep chat!” 
“He’ll make a gun boy, mark my 
words.” 

“Bah! you more invest the mis- 
adventure than a market-place trin- 
ket chafferer! In any case, the imp’s 
beyond recovery!” 

Part of me wanted to just skip 
over this part of the dream and sink 
back down into the big, soft black 
that was waiting for me, but a little 
voice somewhere back behind my 
eyes was telling me to do something 
fast, before bad things happened. I 
made a big effort and got one eye- 
lid open. Everything looked red and 
hazy. The three of them were stand- 
ing ten feet away, near the door. The 
one with the funny way of speaking 
was big, built solid as a line-backer, 
with slicked-back black hair and a 
little mustadhe. He wore a loose 
jacket covered with pockets; he 
looked like Clark Gable playing 
Frank Buck.

IF 




The other man was not much old- 
er than me; he had a rugged jawline, 
a short nose, curly reddish-brown 
hair, wide shoulders, slim hips in a 
form-fitting gray coverall. He was 
pretty enough to be a TV interne. 

The girl ... I had to stop and 
get the other eyelid up. No girl could 
be that pretty. She had jet black 
hair and smoky gray eyes big enough 
to go wading in; an oval face, mel- 
low ivory-colored skin, features like 
one of those old statues. She was 
wearing a white coverall, and the 
form it fit was enough to break 
your heart. 

I made a move to sit up, and pain 
broke over me like a wave. It 
seemed to be coming mostly from 
my left arm. I took hold of the wrist 
with my other hand and got up on 
one elbow with no more effort than 
it takes to swing a safe in your teeth. 

Nobody seemed to notice. When 
the whirly lights settled down, they 
were still standing there, still argu- 
ing. 

“. a spot of bother, Desroy, 
but it’s worth a go.” 

“Methinks sloth instructs thee, 
naught else!” The big fellow turned 
and stamped off. The young fellow 
grinned at the girl. 

“Just twisting the old boy’s tail. 
Actually, he’s right. You nip off and 
soothe him down a bit. I’ll attend to 
this.” 

I slid over the edge of my nest 
and kind of fell to the floor. At the 
noise, they both whirled on me. I 
got hold of the floor and swung it 
around under me. 

“I just came in to get out of the 



weather,” I meant to say, but it 
came out as a sort of gargly sound. 

The man took a quick step toward 
me and over his shoulder said, “Pop 
off now, Milady.” He had a hand 
on a thing clipped to his belt. I 
didn’t need a set of technical specifi- 
cations to tell me it was some kind 
of gun. The girl moved up quickly 
and put her hand on his arm. 

“Orfeo — the poor creature suf- 
fers!” She spoke English with an ac- 
cent that made it sound like music. 

He moved her around behind him. 
“He might be dangerous, Now do 
be a good child and toddle off.” 

“I’m . not dangerous,” I man- 
aged to get the words out. The smile 
was less successful. I felt sick. But 
I wasn’t going to come unfed jn 
front of her . I got my back against 
the pile of furs and tried to stand up 
straight. 

“So you can talk,” the man said. 
He was frowning at me. “Damn me 
if I know what to do with you.” He 
seemed to be talking to himself. 

“Just ... let me rest a few min- 
utes . and I’ll be on my way . .” 
I could hear my pulse thudding in 
my ears like bongo drums. 

“Why did you come aboard?” the 
man snapped the question at me. 
“What did you think you’d find 
here?” 

“I was cold,” I said. “It was warm 
here.” 

He snorted. “Letting yourself in 
for a devilish change of scene, 
weren’t you?” 

His first words were beginning to 
filter through. “What is this place?” 
I asked him. 

“You’re aboard Lord Desroy ’s

yacht. And he’s not keen on contra- 
band holed up in the aft lazaret.” 

i C A boat?” I felt I’d missed some- 
thing somewhere. The last I 
remembered was a farmhouse, in the 
middle of nowhere. “You must be 
fooling me.” I tried to show him a 
smile to let him know I got the joke. 
“I don’t feel any waves.” 

“She’s a converted ketch, stressed- 
field primaries, ion-pulse auxiliaries, 
fitted with full antiac and variable 
G gear, four years out of Zeridajh 
on a private expedition. Every square 
inch of her is allocated to items in 
specific support of her mission in 
life, which brings us back to you. 
What’s your name?” he asked. 
v “Billy Danger. I don’t understand 
all that about a catch.” 

“Just think of her as a small space- 
ship.” He sounded impatient. “Now, 
Billy Danger, it’s up to me to — ” 
“Spaceship? You mean like they 
shoot astronauts off in?” 

Orfeo laughed. “Astronauts, eh? 
Couple of natives paddling about the 
shallows in a dug-out canoe. No, 
Billy Danger, this is a deep space 
yacht, capable of cruising for many 
centuries at multiple-light velocities. 
At the moment, she’s on course for 
a world very distant from your na- 
tive Earth.” 

“Wait a minute,” I said. I wanted 
everything to slow down for just a 
second while I got caught up with it. 
“I don’t want to go to any star. I 
just want out of here.” I tried a 
step and had to lean against the bale 
beside me. “Just let me off, and I’ll 
disappear so quick you’ll think you 
dreamed me.” 



“I’m afraid that’s not practical,” 
Orfeo cut me off short. “Now you’re 
here, the question is what to do with 
you. As you doubtless heard, Lord 
Desroy’s in favor of putting you out 
the lock. As for myself, I have hopes 
of making use of you. Know any- 
thing about weapons? Hunted 
much?” 

“Just let me off,” I said. “Any- 
where at all. I’ll walk home.” 

“You must answer my questions 
promptly, Billy Danger! WTiat be- 
comes of you depends on how well 
you answer them.” 

uj never hunted,” I said. My 
breath was short, as if I’d run 
a long way. 

“That’s all right. Nothing to un- 
learn. How old are you?” 

“Nineteen, next April.” 

“Amazing. You look younger. Are 
you quick to learn, Billy Danger?” 

“It’s kidnapping,” I said. “You 
can’t just kidnap a man. There’s 
laws . .” 

“Mind your tongue, Billy Danger! 
I’ll tolerate no insolence, you’d best 
understand that at the outset! As for 
law, Lord Desroy makes the law 
here. This is his vessel. With the ex- 
ception of the Lady Raire and my- 
self, he owns every atom aboard her, 
including stowaways.” 

A sudden thought occurred to me, 
like an ice pick through the heart. 
“You’re not . Earthmen, are 
you?” 

“Happily, no.” 

“But you look human; you speak 
English.” 

“Of course we’re human. Much 
older stock than your own unfortu-

nate branch. We’ve spent a year on 
your drab little world, going after 
walrus, elephant, that sort of thing. 
Now, that’s enough chatter, Billy 
Danger. Do you think you can learn 
to be a proper gunbearer?” 

“How long — before we go back?” 
“To Earth? Never, I trust. Now, 
see here! Don’t fret about matters 
out of your control! Your job is to 
keep me happy with you. If you can 
do that, you’ll stay alive and well. If 
not ...” He let the rest hang. 
“But then, I’m sure you’ll try your 
best, eh, Billy Danger?” 

It was crazy, but the way he said 
it, I believed every word of it. The 
thing I had to do right now was stay 
alive. Then, later, I could worry 
about getting home. 

“Sure,” I said. “I’ll try.” 

“Right. That’s settled, then.” Or- 
feo looked relieved, as if he’d just 
found an excuse to put off a mean 
chore. “You were lucky, you know. 
You took eight gravities unprotected. 
A wonder you didn’t break a few 
bones.” 

I was still holding my left arm by 
the wrist. I eased it around front, 
and felt the sharp point poking out 
through my sleeve. 

“Who said I didn’t?” I asked him 
and felt myself folding like a wind- 
blown newspaper. 

in 

I woke up feeling different. At first 
I couldn’t quite dope out what 
it was. Then I got it: I was clean, 
fresh-shaved, sweet-smelling, tucked 
in between sheets as crisp as new 
dollar bills. And I felt good. I tingled 



all over, as if I’d just had a needle 
shower and a rubdown. 

The room I was in was a little 
low-ceilinged cubby hole with noth- 
ing much in it but the pallet I was 
lying on. I remembered the arm then 
and pulled back a loose yellow sleeve 
somebody had put on me. Outside 
of a little swelling and a bright pink 
scar under a clear plastic patch, it 
was as good as new. 

Something clicked, and a little 
door in the wall slid back. The man 
named Orfeo stuck his head in. " 

“Good, you’re awake. About time. 
I’m about to field-strip the Z-guns. 
You’ll watch.” 

I got up and discovered that my 
knees didn’t wobble any more. I 
felt strong enough to run up a wall. 
And hungry. Just thinking about 
ham and eggs made my jaws ache. 
Orfeo tossed me a set of yellow cov- 
eralls from a closet back of a sliding 
panel. 

“Try these. I cut them down from 
Jongo’s old cape.” 

I pulled them on. The cloth was 
tough and light and smooth as glove 
silk. 

“How are you feeling?” Orfeo 
was looking me up and down. 

“Fine,” I said. “How long did I 
sleep?” 

“Ninety-six hours. I doped you a 
bit.” 

I ran a finger over my new scar. 
“I don’t understand about the arm. 
I remember it as being broken. 
Broken bad.” 

“A Hunter has to know a little 
field medicine,” he said. “While I 
was about it, I gave you a good 
worming and balanced up your body

chemistry.” He shook his head. 
“Bloody wonder you could walk, the 
rot that boiled out of you. Bloody 
microbe culture. How’s your vision?” 
I blinked at the wall. If there’d 
been a fly there, I could have counted 
his whiskers. “Good,” I said. “Better 
than it’s ever been.” 

“Well, you’re no good to me sick,” 
he said, as if he had to apologize. 

“Thanks,” I said. “For the arm, 
and the bath and the pretty yellow 
pajamas, too.” 

“Don’t thank me. The Lady Raire 
took care of that part.” 

“You mean . the girl . .?” 
“She’s the Lady Raire, Jongo! And 
I’m Sir Orfeo. As for the washup and 
the kit, someone had to do it. You 
stank to high heaven. Now come 
along. We’ve a great deal to cover 
if you’re to be of any use to me 
on the hunt.” 

T he armory was a small room 
lined with racks full of guns 
that weren’t like any guns I’d ever 
seen before. There were handguns, 
rifles, rocket-throwers, some with 
short barrels, some with just a bundle 
of glass rods, some with fancy tele- 
scopic sights, one that looked like 
a flare pistol with a red glass ther- 
mometer on the side, and there were 
a few big elephant guns of Earth 
manufacture. The whole room glit- 
tered like Tiffany’s front window. I 
ran a finger along a stock made of 
polished purple wood, with fittings 
like solid gold. “It looks like Mr. 
Desroy goes first class.” 

“Keep your hands off the weapons 
until you know how to service 
them.” Sir Orfeo poked buttons. A 



table tilted up out of the floor, and 
a section of ceiling over it glared 
up brighter than before. He flipped 
a switch, and the lock-bar on a rack 
snapped up, and he lifted out a 
heavy-looking, black-stocked item 
with a drum magazine and three trig- 
gers and a flared shoulder plate, 
chrome plated. 

“This is a Z-gun,” he said. “It’s 
a handy all-around piece, packs 
.8 megaton/seconds of firepower, 
weight four pounds three ounces.” 
He snapped a switch on the side back 
and forth a couple of times and 
handed the gun across to me. 

“What’s a megaton/second?” I 
asked him. 

“Enough power to vaporize the 
yacht if it were released at one burst. 
At full gain the Z-gun will punch a 
3mm hole through an inch of flint 
steel at a range of five miles with a 
five millisecond burst.” He went on 
to tell me a lot more about Z-guns, 
crater-rifles, infinite repeaters, fila- 
ment pistols. 

At the end of it I didn’t know 
much more about the weapons Lord 
Desroy would be using on his hunt, 
but I was feeling sorry for whatever 
it was he was after. 

S ir Orfeo took me back to the little 
room I’d waked up in, showed 
me how to work a gadget that de- 
livered a little can of pink oatmeal, 
steaming hot. I sniffed it; it smelled 
like seaweed. I tasted it. It was flat 
and insipid, like paper mache. 

“Sir Orfeo, I hate to complain 
about a free gift,” I said. “But are 
you sure this was meant for a man 
to eat?” 



SPACEMAN!

“Jongo wasn’t really a man.” 

I kind of goggled at him. “What 
was he?” 

“A Lithian. Very good boy, Jongo. 
With me for a long time.” He 
glanced around the room. “Damned 
if it doesn’t give me a touch of 
something-or-other to see you in his 
kennel.” 

“Kennel?” 

“Nest, pitch, call it cabin if you 
like.” Sir Orfeo beetled a fine eye- 
brow at me. “Don’t be putting on 
airs, Billy Danger. I’ve no patience 
with it.” 

He left me there to dine in soli- 
tude. Afterwards, he gave me a tour 
of the ship. He was showing me a 
fancy leather and inlay lounge when 
Lord Desroy came in. 

“Ah, there you are, Desroy,” Or- 
feo said in a breezy way. “Just oc- 
curred to me you might like to have 
Jongo — ah, Billy Danger, that is — 
do a bit of a dust-up here in the 
lounge.” 

“How now? Hast lost thy wits, 
Orfeo? Hie the moon-calf hence i’ 
the instant!” 

“Steady on, Desroy. Just thought 
I’d ask—” 

“I’ve a whim to chide the varlet 
for his impertinence!” the big boss 
barked and took a step toward me. 
Orfeo pushed me behind him. 

“Don’t blame the boy. My doing, 
you know,” he said in a nice cool 
tone. 

“Thy role of advocate for this 
scurvy patch would want credit, an I 
stood not witness on’t!” 

We went on down the stairs. In- 
stead of looking mad, Sir Orfeo was 
smiling and humming between his 



teeth. He dropped the smile when 
he saw me looking at him. 

“I advise you to stay out of Lord 
Desroy’s way, Jongo. For now, he’s 
willing to humor me along; I have a 
carefully nutured reputation for tem- 
perament, you see. If I get upset the 
game might turn out to be scarce. 
But if you ruffle his feathers by be- 
ing underfoot, he might act hastily.” 
“He has a strange way of talking,” 
I said. “What kind of accent is that?” 
“Eh? Oh, it’s a somewhat archaic 
dialect of English. Been some three 
hundred years since his lordship last 
visited Earth. Now, that’s enough 
gossip, Jongo — ” 

“It’s Billy Dan — ” 

“I’ll call you Jongo. Shorter. Now 
let’s get along to Hold F, and you 
can earn your keep by polishing a 
spot of brightwork in Environment- 
al.” 

The polishing turned out to be a 
job of scraping slimy deposits off 
the valves and piping. Sir Orfeo left 
me to it while he went back up and 
joined in whatever they were doing 
on the other side of the forbidden 
door. 

IV 

O ne day Sir Orfeo showed me a 
star chart and pointed out the 
relative locations of Earth, Gar 28, 
the world we were headed for at the 
moment, and Zeridajh, far in toward 
the big gob of stars at the center of 
the galaxy. 

“We’ll never get there,” I said. “I 
read somewhere it takes a hundred 
thousand years to cross the galaxy; 
Gar 28 must be about ten light-years 



16 



IF 




away; and Zeridojh is thousands!” 

He laughed. “The limiting velocity 
of light is a myth, Jongo,” he said. 
“Like the edge of (the world your 
early sailors were afraid they’d fall 
over — or the sound barrier you 
used to worry about. This vessel 
could reach Zeridajh in eighteen 
months, if she stretched her legs.” 

I wanted to ask him why Lord 
Desroy picked such a distant part 
of the sky to go hunting in, but I’d 
learned not to be nosy. Whatever 
the reasons were, they were some- 
body’s secret. 

After my first few weeks away 
from all time indicators, I began to 
develop my own internal time-sense, 
independent of the three-hour cycles 
that were the Galactic shipboard 
standard. I could sense when an hour 
had passed, and looking back, I 
knew, without knowing how I knew, 
just about how long I’d been away 
from Earth. I might have been 
wrong — there was no way to check 
— but the sense was very definite, 
and always consistent. 

I had been aboard just under six 
weeks when Sir Orfeo took me to 
the personal equipment room one 
day and fitted me out with thermal 
boots, leggings, gloves, a fancy pair 
of binocular sunglasses, breathing 
apparatus, a back-pack and a tem- 
perature suit. He spent an hour fuss- 
ing over me, getting everything fitted 
just right. Then he told me to go 
and tie down in my digs. I did, and 
for the next hour the yacht shook 
and shrilled and thumped. When the 
noise stopped, Sir Orfeo came along 
and yelled to me to get into my 
kit and come down to F Hold. When 



I got there, walking pretty heavy 
with all the gear I was carrying or 
had strapped to my back, (he was 
there checking items off a list. 

“A little more juldee next time, 
Jongo,” he snapped at me. “Come 
along now; I’ll want your help in 
getting the ground-car out ship- 
shape.” 

It was a powerful-looking vehicle, 
wide, squatty, with tracks like a small 
tank, a plastic bubble dome over 
the top. There was a roomy com- 
partment up front full of leather and 
inlaid wood and brightwork, and a 
smaller space behind, with two hard 
seats. Lord Desroy showed up in his 
Frank Buck bush jacket and jodh- 
purs and a wide-brimmed hat; the 
Lady Raire wore her white coverall. 
Sir Orfeo was dressed in his usual 
tailored gray with a filament pistol 
strapped, to his hip and a canteen 
and bush knife on the other side. 
We all wore temperature suits, which 
were like long-handled underwear, 
under the coveralls. “Keep your hel- 
met closed, Jongo,” Sir Orfeo told 
me. “Toxic atmosphere, you know.” 

He pushed a button and a door 
opened up in the side of the hold, 
and I was looking out at a plain 
bluish grass. A wave of heat rolled 
in, and the thermostat in my suit 
clicked and right away it turned cool 
against my skin. Sir Orfeo started 
up, and the car lifted a couple of 
inches from the floor, swung around 
and slid out under the open sky of 
a new world. 

F or the next five hours I perched 
on my seat with my mouth 
open, taking in the sights: the high, 



SPACEMAN!

blue-black sky, strange trees like 
overgrown parsley sprigs, the leath- 
ery grass that stretched to a horizon 
that was too far away — and the 
animals. 

The things we were after were 
big crab-armored monstrosities, pale 
purple and white, with mouths full 
of needle-pointed teeth and horns all 
over their faces. Lord Desroy shot 
two of them, stopping the oar and 
going forward on foot. I guess it 
took courage, but I didn’t see the 
point in it. Each time, he and Sir 
Orfee made a big thing of hacking 
off one of the horns and taking a 
lot of pictures and congratulating 
each other. The Lady Raire just 
watched from the car. She didn’t 
seem to smile much. 

We loaded up and went on to 
another world then, and Milford shot 
a thing as big as a diesel locomotive. 
Sir Orfeo never talked about him- 
self or the other members of the 
party, or the world they came from, 
but he explained the details of the 
hunt to me, gave me pointers on 
tracking and approaching, told me 
which gun to use for different kinds 
of quarry. Not much of it stuck. 
After the fourth or fifth hunt, it all 
got a little stale. 

“This next world is called Gar 
28,” Sir Orfeo, woke me up to tell 
me after a long stretch in space. 
“Doesn’t look like much; dry, you 
know; but there’ll be keen hunting. 
I found this one myself, running 
through tapes made by a survey team 
a few hundred years ago. The fel- 
lows we’ll be going after they called 
dire-beast. You’ll understand why 
when you see the beggars.” 



He was right about Gar 28. We 
started out across a rugged desert 
of dry-baked pink and tan and yel- 
low clay, fissured and cracked by the 
sun, with points of purplish rock 
pushing up here and there, a line 
of jagged peaks for a horizon. It 
didn’t look like game country to me, 
but then I wasn’t the Hunter. 

The sun was high in the sky, too 
bright to look at, a little smaller than 
the one I was used to. It was cool 
and comfortable inside the car; it 
hummed along a couple of feet above 
the ground, laying a dust trail be- 
hind it from the air blast it was rid- 
ing on. The tracks were for hills that 
were too steep for the air cushion 
to climb. 

About a mile from the yacht, I 
looked back; it was just a tiny glint, 
like a lost needle, among all that 
desolation. 

Up front, on the other side of the 
glass panel, Lord Desroy and Sir 
Orfeo and the Lady Raire chatted 
away in their odd language, and 
every now and then said something 
in that strange brand of English they 
spoke. I could hear them through a 
speaker hookup in the back of the 
car. If I’d had something to say, I 
don’t know whether they could have 
heard it or not. 

A fter two hours run, we pulled up 
at the top of a high escarpment. 
Sir Orfeo opened the hatch, and we 
all got out. I remembered Sir Orfeo 
had told me always to stay close 
with his gun when we were out of 
the car so I got out one of the crater 
rifles and came up behind them in 
time to see Sir Orfeo point.

“There — by the double peak at 
the far end of the fault-line!” He 
snapped his goggles up and whirled 
to start back and almost slammed 
into me. A very thin slice of an in- 
stant later I was lying on my back 
with my head swimming, looking 
into the operating end of his fila- 
ment pistol. 

“Never come up behind me with 
a weapon in your hand!” 

I got up, with my head still whang- 
ing from the blow he’d hit me, and 
followed them to the car, and we 
went tearing back down the slope 
the way we’d come. 

It was a fast fifteen-minute run 
out across the flats toward where 
Sir Orfeo had seen whatever it was 
he saw. I had my binocular goggles 
on and was looking hard, but all I 
saw was the dusty plain and the 
sharp rock spires, growing taller as 
we rushed toward them. Then Sir 
Orfeo swung the car to the left in 
a wide curve and pulled to a stop 
behind a low ridge. 

“Everybody out!” he snapped and 
popped the hatch up and was over 
the side. 

“Don’t sit there and brood, Jon- 
go!” He was grinning, excited and 
happy now. “My crater rifle; Z-guns 
for his lordship and Lady Raire!” 

I handed the weapons down to 
him, stock-first, the way he’d told 
me. 

“You’ll carry the extra crater and 
a filament pistol,” he said and 
moved back up front to go into con- 
ference with the others. I strapped 
on the gun and grabbed the rifle and 
hopped down just as Sir Orfeo and 
Lord Desroy started off. The Lady 



Raire followed about ten feet back, 
and I took up my post offside to the 
right about five yards. My job was 
to keep that relative position to Sir 
Orfeo, no matter what, until he 
yelled, “close!” Then I was to move 
in quick. That was about all I knew 
about a hunt. That, and don’t come 
up behind Sir Orfeo with a gun. 

The sun still seemed to be about 
where it had been when we started 
out. There was a little wind blowing 
from behind, keeping a light cloud 
of dust rolling along ahead. It 
seemed to me I’d heard somewhere 
that you were supposed to sneak up 
on game from upwind, but that 
wasn’t for me to worry about. All 
I had to do was maintain my interval. 
We came into a slight rise of ground. 
The wind was picking up, driving 
a thick curtain of dust ahead. For 
a few seconds I couldn’t see anything 
but that yellow fog swirling all 
around. I stopped and heard a sound, 
a deep thoom! thooml thooml . 

“Close! Damn your eyes, Jongo, 
close!” Sir Orfeo shouted. I ran to- 
ward the sound of his voice, tripped 
over a rock, and went flat. I could 
hear Lord Desroy shouting some- 
thing and the thoom-thoom, louder 
than before. I scrambled up and ran 
on forward, and as suddenly as it 
had blown up, the gale died and the 
dust rolled away from us. Sir Orfeo 
was twenty feet off to my left, with 
Lord Desroy beside him. I changed 
direction and started toward them, 
and saw Sir Orfeo make a motion, 
and Lord Desroy brought his rifle 
up and I looked where he was aim- 
ing and out of the dust cloud a thing 
came galloping that was right out of 



SPACEMAN!

a nightmare. It was big — twenty, 
thirty feet high, running on two legs 
that seemed to have too many knees. 
The feet were huge snowshoelike 
pads, and they rose and fell like 
something in a slow-motion movie, 
driving dust from under them in big 
spurts, and at each stride the ground 
shook. A second one came charging 
out of the dust cloud, and it was 
bigger than the first one. Their hides 
were a glistening greenish brown, 
except where they were coated with 
dust, and there was a sort of cape 
of ragged skin flapping from the 
narrow shoulders of one as he ran, 
and I thought he must be shedding. 
Thick necks rose from the shoulders, 
with wide, flat heads that were all 
mouth, like /the bucket of a dragline. 
And then a third, smaller edition 
came scampering after the big fel- 
lows. 

A ll this happened in maybe a sec- 
ond or two. I had skidded to 
a halt and was standing there in a 
half crouch, literally paralyzed. I 
couldn’t have moved „ if an express 
train had been coming straight at me. 
And these were worse than express 
trains. 

They were about a hundred and 
fifty yards away when Lord Desroy 
fired. I heard the Z-gun make a 
sharp whickering noise and an elec- 
tric blue light flashed up and lit the 
rocks like lightning, and the lead 
monster broke stride and veered off 
to the left, running irregularly now. 
He leaned, losing his balance, but 
still driving on, His neck whipped 
back and up and the head flailed 
offside as he went down, hit, bounced 



half upright, his legs still pumping, 
then went into a tumble of flailing 
legs and neck and the dust closed 
over him, and only then I heard the 
shuddering boom he made hitting 
the ground. 

And the second one was still com- 
ing, closer now than number one had 
been when he was hit, and the little 
fellow — a >baby, only fifteen feet 
high — sprinted up alongside him, 
tilted his head sideways and snapped 
at his big brother’s side. 

I saw a flash of white as the hide 
and muscle tore. Then the little one 
was skidding to a halt on his 
haunches, his big jaws working hard 
over the bite he’d gotten, while the 
one that had supplied the snack came 
on, looming up as high as a two- 
story house, black blood streaming 
down his flank, coming straight at 
Lord Desroy. I saw the Lady Raire 
then, just beyond him, right in the 
path of the charge; and still I couldn’t 
move. Lord Desroy had his gun up 
again and it flickered and flashed 
and made its slapping noise and the 
biped’s head, that it had been carry- 
ing high on its long neck, drooped 
and the neck went slack and the 
head came down and hit the ground 
and the big haunches, with the big 
feet still kicking, went up and over 
high in the air in a somersault and 
slammed the ground with a smash 
like two semi’s colliding, and flipped 
up and went over again with one 
leg still pumping, and then it was 
looping the loop on the ground, kick- 
ing up a dust cloud that hid every- 
thing beyond it. 

“Watch for baby!” Sir Orfeo 
yelled, and I could barely hear his 



20 



IF 




voice through the thudding and 
pounding. Then the little one stalked 
out of the dust, tossing his head to 
help him swallow down what he 
had in his mouth. Sir Orfeo brought 
his gun up, and the cub was coming 
straight at me, and the gun tracked 
him and went off with a flat crackkk! 
that kicked a pit the size of a wash- 
tuib in the rock beside him, and the 
young one changed direction and 
trotted off, and Sir Orfeo let him go. 

The dust was blowing away now, 
except for what number two was still 
kicking up with one foot that was 
twitching, still trying to run. Lord 
Desroy and Sir Orfeo went over to 
it, and the Hunter used his pistol 
to put it out of its misery. It went 
slack, and a gush of fluid sluiced out 
of its mouth, and then suddenly, it 
was quiet. 

“In sooth, the beast raised a din 
to make the ground quake,” Lord 
Desroy called in a light-hearted tone. 
He walked around the creature, and 
Sir Orfeo went over to the other 
one, and about then I got my joints 
unlocked and trotted after him. Sir 
Orfeo looked up as I came up and 
gave me a grin. 

“I think perhaps you’ll make a 
gun-boy yet, Jongo,” he said. “You 
were a bit slow coming up, but you 
held steady as a rock during the 
charge.” 

And for some reason I felt kind of 
ashamed of myself, knowing how it 
had really been. 

V 

L ord Desroy spent quarter of an 
hour taking movies of the dead 



animals; then we made the hike back. 

“We were lucky, Desroy,” Sir 
Orfeo told him as we settled Into our 
seats. “Takes a bit of doing to knock 
over a fine brace on the first stalk! 
I suggest we go back to the yacht 
now and call it a day.” 

“What foolery’s this?” Lord Des- 
roy boomed out. “Wi’ a foison o’ 
quarry to hand, ye’d skulk back to 
thy comforts wi’out further sweat 
or endeavor?” 

“No use to start pushing our 
luck — ” 

“Prithee, spare! Ye spoke but now 
of bull-devil, lurking in the crags 
yonder.” 

“Plenty of time to go after them 
later.” Orfeo was still smiling, but 
there was an edge to his voice. He 
didn’t like to have anyone argue 
with him about a hunt. 

“A pox on’t!” Lord Desroy 
slammed his fist down on the arm 
of his chair. “Dost dream I’d loiter 
in my chambers with game abound- 
ing? Drive on, I say, or I’ll take the 
tiller self!” 

Sir Orfeo slapped the drive lever 
in and the engines started up with 
a howl. 

“I was thinking of the Lady 
Raire,” he said. “If you’re that dead- 
set on running us all ragged, very 
well! Though what the infernal rush 
is, I’m sure I don’t know!” 

As usual, the Lady Raire sat by 
quietly, looking cool and calm and 
too beautiful to be real. Lord Desroy 
got out a silver flask and poured 
out yellow wine for her and himself, 
then lolled back in his chair and 
gazed out at the landscape rushing 

past.

A n hour brought us to the foothills 
of the range that had beeS visi- 
ble from the yacht. The going was 
rougher here; we switched over to 
tracks for the climb. Sir Orfeo had 
quit humming to himself and was 
beginning to frown, as if maybe he 
was thinking about how nice it would 
be to be back in his apartment 
aboard the yacht, having a bath and 
a nice dinner, instead of being in 
for another four hours, minimum, 
in the car. 

We came out on a high plateau, 
and Sir Orfeo pulled the car under 
a steep escarpment and opened up 
and climbed down without a word 
to anybody. I had his crater rifle 
ready for him; I took the other guns 
and got out and Lord Desroy looked 
around and said something I didn’t 
catch. 

“They’re here right enough,” Sir 
Orfeo answered him, sounding mad. 
He walked off, and Lord Desroy and 
the girl trailed. I had to scramble 
up on rough ground to get to my 
proper position off to Sir Orfeo’s 
right. He was headed into a narrow 
cut that curved up and away in deep 
shadow. The sun still seemed to be 
in the same spot, directly overhead. 
My suit kept me comfortable enough, 
but the heat reflecting back from 
the stone scalded my face. 

Sir Orfeo noticed me working my 
way along up above him and snarled 
something about where the devil 
did I think I was going; I didn’t try 
to answer that. I’d gotten myself 
onto a ledge that ran along twenty 
feet above the trail, with no way 
down. I stayed abreast of Sir Orfeo, 
awaiting a chance to rejoin them. 



We kept going this way, nobody 
talking, the happy look long gone 
from Lord Desroy’s face now, the 
Lady Raire walking just to his left, 
Sir Orfeo out in front twenty paces. 
The trail did a sharp jog to the left, 
and I had to scramble to catch up; 
as I did, I saw something move on 
the rocks up ahead. 

Being above the rest of them, I 
had a view past the next outcropping 
that hung out over the trail; the 
movement I saw was just a flicker 
of something in the shadows, spread 
out flat on the rock like a giant 
leech. I felt my heart take a jump 
and jam itself up in my throat and 
I tried to yell and choked and tried 
again: “Sir Orfeo! Up ahead! On the 
right!” 

He stopped dead, swung his gun 
around and up, at the same time 
motioned to the others to halt. Lord 
Desroy checked for just a moment; 
then he started on up toward Sir Or- 
feo. The animal — creature — thing 
— whatever it was — moved again. 
Now I could see what looked like 
an eye near the front, surrounded 
by a fringe of stiff reddish hairs. I 
got just the one quick look, before 
I heard the whisper of a Z-gun from 
below, and the thing jerked back 
violently and disappeared into black 
shadow. Down below, Lord Desroy 
was lowering his gun. 

“Well, that tears it!” Sir Orfeo 
said in a too-loud voice. “Nice bit 
of shooting, Desroy! You failed to 
keep to your position, fired without 
my permission and then succeeded 
in wounding the beggar! Anything 
else you’d care to try before we go 
into that cranny after him?”

IF 




“Methinks you skirt insolence, Or- 
feo,” Lord Desroy started. 

“Not intentionally, as I’m 
damned!” Orfeo’s face was red; I 
could see the flush from where I 
was perched, twenty feet above him. 
“I’ll remind you I'm master of the 
Hunt, I'm responsible for the safety 
of the party — ” 

“I’m out of patience wi’ cautious 
counsel!” Lord Desroy roared. “Shall 
I be merely cheated o* my sport 
whilst I attend you swoons?” 

Sir Orfeo started to answer that, 
then caught himself and laughed. 

“ ’Pon my word, you have a way 
about you, milord! Now, I suggest 
we give over this tomfoolery and 
give a thought to how we’re going 
to get him out of there!” He turned 
and squinted up toward the place 
where the thing had disappeared. 

“I warrant ye make mockery of 
me,” Lord Desroy growled. He 
jerked his head in my direction. 
“Dispatch yon natural to draw forth 
the beast!” Sir Orfeo looked up, too, 
then back at his boss. 

“The boy’s new, untrained,” he 
said. “That’s a risky bit of busi- 
ness — ” 

“D’ye aver thy gun-boy lacks 
spirit, then?” 

Sir Orfeo gave me a sharp look. 
“By no means,” he said. “He’s steady 
enough. Jongo!” His voice changed 
tone. “Press on a few yards, see if 
you can rout the blighter out.” 

I didn’t move. I just squatted where 
I was and stared down at him. 
The next instant, something smashed 
against the wall beside my head and 
knocked me sprawling. I came up 



spitting dust, with my head ringing, 
and Lord Desroy’s second shot 
crashed close enough to drive stone 
chips into my cheek. 

“Sir Orfeo!” I got the yell out. 
“He’s shooting at meP* 

I heard Sir Orfeo shout, and I 
rolled over and looked for a hole 
to dive into and in that instant saw 
the wounded leech-thing flow down 
across the rock, disappear for a sec- 
ond behind a spur, come into view 
again just above the frail, about thir- 
ty feet above Lord Desroy, between 
him and the Lady Raire. 

It must have made some sound I 
couldn’t hear. Before I could shout 
Lord Desroy whirled and brought 
his gun up and it crackled and vivid 
shadows winked on the rocks. The 
animal leaped out and down, broad 
as a blanket, leathery dark, right 
into the gun. Lord Desroy stood his 
ground, firing steadily into the leech- 
thing until the instant it struck full 
on him, covering him completely. It 
gathered itself together and lurched 
toward the Lady Raire, standing all 
alone in the trail, sixty feet behind 
where I was. As it moved, it left a 
trail of what was left of Lord Desroy. 

Sir Orfeo had fired once, while the 
thing was in the air. He ran toward 
it, stopped and took aim and fired 
again. I saw a movement off to the 
right, up the trail, and a second 
leech thing was there coming up 
fast behind Sir Orfeo, big as a hip- 
popotamus, wide and flat and with 
its one eye gleaming green. 

I yelled. He didn’t look up, just 
stood where he was, back to the 
leech, firing, and firing again. The 
wounded leech was close to the Lady

Raire now, and I saw then that she 
had no gun, and I remembered that 
Lord Desroy had taken it and had 
been carrying it for her. She stood 
there, facing the thing, while Sir Or- 
feo poured the fire into it. At each 
shot, a chunk flew from its back, but 
it never slowed — and behind Sir 
Orfeo the other one was closing the 
gap. 

Sir Orfeo could have turned his 
fire on it and saved himself; but he 
never budged. I realized I was yell- 
ing at the top of my lungs, and then 
I remembered I had a gun, too, slung 
across my back to free my hands 
for climbing. I grabbed for it, wasted 
a second or more fumbling with it, 
got it around and to my shoulder 
and aimed and couldn’t find the 
firing stud and had to lower it and 
look and brought it up again and 
centered it on the thing only yards 
from Sir Orfeo’s exposed back and 
squeezed — 

The recoil almost knocked me off 
my feet, not that it was bad, but 
I wasn’t expecting it. I got back 
on target and fired again, and 
again; and it kept coming, Six feet 
from Sir Orfeo the thing reared up, 
tall as a grizzly, and I got a glimpse 
of a yellow underside covered with 
shredding hooks, and I fired into it 
and then it was dropping down on 
Sir Orfeo and at the last possible 
second he moved, but not far 
enough, and the thing struck him 
and knocked him rolling and then 
he and it lay still. I traversed the 
gun across to the other beast and 
saw that it was down, ten feet from 
Milady Raire, bucking and writh- 
ing, coiling back on itself. It flopped 



up against the side wall and rolled 
back down, half on its back and lay 
still and <the echoes of its struggle 
went racketing away up the ravine. 
I heard Sir Orfeo make a moaning 
sound where he lay all bloody and 
the Lady Raire looked up and her 
eyes met mine and we looked at each 
other across the terrible silence. 

VI 

S ir Orfeo was still alive, with all 
the flesh torn off the back of 
his thighs and the glistening white 
bone Showing. 

He caught at my arm when I 
bent over him. “Jongo — your job 
now — the Lady Raire . .” 

I was shaking, and tears were 
running down my face. I tried not 
to look at his horrible wounds. 

“Buck up, man.” Sir Orfeo’s 
voice was a groan of agony. “I’m 
depending on you . keep her 
safe . your responsibility, 

now . .” 

“Yes,” I said. “I’ll take care of 
her, Sir Orfeo.” 

“Good . now . water. Fetch 
water . from the car . .” 

I ran off to follow his orders. 
When I came back the Lady Raire 
met me, looking pale and with dust 
sticking to the perspiration on her 
forehead. She told me that he’d 
sent her to investigate a sound and 
then dragged himself to where his 
filament pistol had fallen and blown 
his head off. 

I used a crater gun to blast shal- 
low pockets under the overhang- 
ing rock beside the trail; she help- 



24 



IP 




ed me drag the bodies to them. 
Then we went back down to the 
car. We carried our guns at the 
ready, but nothing moved in all 
that jumble of broken rock. Sir 
Orfeo had been lucky about finding 
game, all right. 

The Lady Raire got into the 
driver’s seat and headed back down 
the way we’d come. When we 
reached level ground, she stopped 
and looked around as if she didn’t 
know which way to go. I tapped on 
the glass and her head jerked 
around. I think she had forgotten 
I was there. Poor Lady Raire, so 
all-alone. 

“That direction, Milady,” I said, 
and pointed toward where the yacht 
was, out of sight over the horizon. 

She followed my directions. 
Three hours later we came up over 
a low ridge, and there was the 
yacht, glittering far away across the 
desert. Another forty-five minutes 
and we pulled up in front of the 
big cargo door. 

She jumped down and went to 
it and twinkled her fingers on a 
polished metal disk set in the hull 
beside it. Nothing happened. 

She went around to the smaller 
personnel door, and the same thing 
happened. Then she looked at me. 
Having her look at me was an 
event even then. 

“We cannot enter,” she said in 
a whisper. “I mind well *twas Sir 
Orfeo’s custom to reset the entry 
code ’ere each planetfall lest the 
yacht be rifled by aborigines.” 

“There’s got to be a way,” I said. 
I went up and hammered on the 
panel and on the control disk and 



walked all the way around the yacht 
and back to the door that I had 
sneaked in by, that first night, and 
tried again, but with no luck. A ter- 
rible, hollow feeling was growing 
inside me. 

“I can shoot a hole in it, maybe,” 
I said. My voice sounded weak in 
the big silence. I unslung the cra- 
ter gun and asked her to step back 
and then took aim from ten feet 
and fired. 

The blast knocked me down, but 
the metal wasn’t even scorched. 

I got to my feet and brushed dust 
off my shins, feeling the full im- 
pact of the situation sinking in like 
the sun that was beating down on 
my back. The Lady Raire looked at 
me, not seeing me. 

“We must . take stock of what 
supplies may be in the car,” she 
said after a long pause. “Then 
canst thou make for thyself a pal- 
let here in the shadow of the boat.” 
“You mean — we’re just going 
to sit here?” 

“If any rescue comes, we must be 
close by the yacht, else they’ll not 
spy us in this endless waste.” 

I took a deep breath and swal- 
lowed hard. “Milady, we can’t stay 
here.” 

“Indeed? Why can we not?” She 
stood there, a slim, aristocratic lit- 
tle girl, giving me a level look 
from those cool gray eyes. 

“I don’t know much about the 
odds against anybody finding us, 
but we’ve got a long wait at best. 
The supplies in the car won’t last 
long. And the heat will wear us 
down. We have to try to find a

better spot. Now. While we’re still 
strong.” I tried to sound confident, 
ns if I knew what I was doing. But 
my voice shook. I was scared; 
scared sick. But I know I was right 
about moving on. 

“ ’Tis a better think to perish 
here than to live on in the wilder- 
ness, without hope.” 

“We’re not dead yet, Milady. But 
we will be if we don’t do some- 
thing about it, now.” 

“I’ll tarry here,” she said. “Flee 
if thou wilt, Jongo.” 

“Sir Orfeo told me to take care 
of you, Milady. I’m going to do my 
best to follow his order.” 

She looked at me coolly. “Wouldst 
force me, then?” 

“I’m afraid so, Milady.” 

She walked to the car stiffly. I 
got in to my usual seat in back 
and she started up and we headed 
out across the desert. 

W e drove until the sun set and 
a huge, pockmarked moon 
rose, looking a lot like the old one 
back home, except that it was al- 
most close enough to touch. We 
slept then, and went on, still in the 
dark. Day came again, %nd I asked 
the Lady Raire to show me how to 
drive so I could relieve her at the 
wheel. After that, we drove shift 
on, shift off, holding course steady 
to the northwest. 

On what I estimated was the 
third day, Earth-style, we reached 
a belt of scrub-land. Half an hour 
later the engine made a gargly sound 
and died, and wouldn’t go again. 

I went forward on foot to a rise 
and looked over the landscape. The 



scrub-dotted waste went on as far 
as I could see. When I got back 
to the car, the Lady Raire was 
standing beside it with a filament 
pistol in her hand. 

“Now indeed is our strait hope- 
less.” She held the gun out to me. 
“Do thy final duty to me, Jongo.” 
Her voice was suddenly a breathless 
whisper. 

I took the gun; then I whirled 
and threw it as far as I could. 
When I faced her, my hands were 
shaking. 

“Don’t ever say anything like 
that again!” I said. “Not ever!” 

“Would you then have me lin- 
ger on, to wither in this heat, shriv- 
el under the sun?” 

I grabbed her arm. It was cool, 
as smooth as satin. “I’m going to 
take care of you, Milady,” I said. 
“I’ll get you home again safe, you’ll 
see!” 

She shook her head. “I have no 
home, Jongo. My loyal friends 
are dead.” 

“I’m still alive. And my name’s 
not Jongo. It’s Billy Danger. I’m 
human, too. I’ll be your friend.” 

She looked straight at me. It 
was the first time she ever really 
looked at me. I looked back, 
straight into her eyes. Then she 
smiled. 

“Thou art valiant, Billy Danger,” 
-she said. “How can I then shrink 
from duty? Lead on, and I’ll fol- 
low while my strength lasts.” 

The car was stocked with food 
concentrates, plus a freezer full of 
delicacies that would have to be 
eaten first, before they spoiled. 
The problem was water. 



SPACEMAN! 



27 




The tanks held about thirty gal- 
lons, but with the distiller out of 
action, there’d be no refilling them. 
There were the weapons and plen- 
ty of ammunition, first-aid sup- 
plies, some spare communicators, 
goggles, boots. It wasn’t much to 
set up housekeeping on. 

For the next week, I quartered 
the landscape over a radius of about 
five miles, looking for a spring or 
water hole, with no luck. By that 
time, the fresh food was gone — 
eaten or spoiled, and the water was 
down to two ten-gallon jugs full. 

“We’ll have to try a longer hike,” 
I told the Lady Raire. “There may 
be an oasis just one ridge farther 
than I’ve gone.” 

“As you wish, Billy Danger,” she 
said, and gave me the smile, like 
sunrise after a long night. 

We packed up the food and 
water and a few extras. I slung a 
Z gun over my shoulder, and 
started off at twilight, after the 
worst of the day’s heat. 

It was monotonous country, just 
hilly enough to give us a long pull 
up to one low crest after another 
and an ankle-turning slog down the 
far side. I steered due west, not 
because the prospects looked any 
better in that direction, but just be- 
cause it was easier to steer straight 
toward the setting sun. 

We did about twenty miles be- 
fore dark, another forty in two 
marches before the sun rose. I wor- 
ried about the Lady Raire, but there 
was nothing I could do that I 
wasn’t already doing. We slogged 
on toward the next ridge, hoping 
for a miracle on the other side. And 



always the next side looked the 
same. 

We rested in the heat of the long 
day, then marched on, into the glare 
of the sun. And about an hour be- 
fore sunset, we saw the cat. 

VII 

H e was standing on a rock on 
the crest of a rise, whipping 
his tail from side to side in a slow, 
graceful motion. He made a grace- 
ful leap to a lower rock and was 
just a dark shadow moving against 
the slope ahead. I unlimbered my 
rifle and watched him close. At 
thirty feet, he paused and sat down 
on his haunches and wrinkled his 
face and began licking his chest. 
He finished and stuck out a long 
tongue and yawned and then rose 
and went loping off into the dusk, 
the way he’d come. 

All the while, we stood there and 
watohed him, not saying a word. 
As soon as he was gone, I went to 
where he’d been sitting. His paw- 
prints were plain in the powdery 
dust. I started believing in him, 
then. I might see imaginary cats, 
but never imaginary cat tracks. We 
set off following them. 

T he water hole was in a hollow 
in the rock, hidden behind a 
wall of black-green foliage growing 
on the brink of a ravine. The Lady 
Raire stopped to gaze at it, but I 
stumbled down the slope and fell 
full length in the water and drank 
in big gulps and luckily choked and 
had a coughing fit before I could 
drink myself to death.

IF 




There was a steep jumble of rock 
rising behind the pool, with the dark 
mouths of caves showing. I picked 
my way around the pond in the 
near-dark with my gun ready in my 
hand. There was a smell of cat in 
the air. I was grateful to tabby for 
leading me to water, but I didn’t 
want him jumping on our backs 
now that it looked like we might 
live another few days. 

The caves weren’t much, just 
holes about ten feet deep, not quite 
high enough to stand up in, with 
enough dirt drifted in them to 
make a more or less level floor. 

The Lady Raire picked out one 
for herself, and I helped her clean 
out the dead leaves and cat drop- 
pings and fix up a stone that could 
be rolled into the opening to block 
it, in case anything bigger than a 
woodchuck wanted in. Then she 
picked out another one and told 
me it was mine and .started in on 
it. It was dark when we finished. 
I saw her to her den, then sat down 
outside it with the pistol in my 
hand and went to sleep .... 

— and woke hungry, clear-head- 
ed, and wondering how a cat hap- 
pened to be here, in this super-Mo- 
jave. I thought about the dire- 
beasts and the meat-shredding 
leeches that had killed Lord Desroy 
and Sir Orfeo. The cat was no re- 
lative of theirs. He had been a 
regulation-type black and gray and 
tan striped feline, complete with 
vertical-slitted pupils and retractable 
claws. He looked like anybody’s 
house cat, except that he was the 
size of a collie dog. 

I’d heard about parallel evolu- 



tion, and I hadn’t been too sur- 
prised when Sir Orfeo had told me 
about how many four-legged, one- 
headed creatures there were in the 
universe. But a copy this perfect 
wasn’t possible. 

That meant one of two things: 
Either I had dreamed the whole 
thing — which was kind of unlike- 
ly, inasmuch as when I looked 
down, I saw two more cats just like 
the other one, in the bright moon- 
light down by the water — or our 
yacht wasn’t the first human-owned 
ship to land on Gar 28 . 

I n the morning light, the water 
looked clear and inviting. The 
Lady Raire studied it for a while, 
then called to me. “Billy Danger, 
watch thee well the while I lave 
me. Methinks ’twill be safe enow.” 
She glanced my way, and I realized 
she was talking about going for a 
swim. I just stared at her. 

“How now, art stricken dumb?” 
she called. 

“The pond may be full of poison 
snakes, crocodiles, quicksand and 
undertows,” I said. 

“I’d as lief be devoured as go 
longer unwashed,” she proceeded 
to unzip the front of the tunic she’d 
changed into from the tempera- 
ture suit and stepped out of it. 
And for the second time in one 
minute, I was struck dumb. She 
stood there in front of me, as 
naked as a goddess and as beautiful, 
and said: “I charge thee, Billy 
Danger, take not thine eyes from 
me,” and turned and waded down 
into the water. It was the easiest 
order to follow I ever heard of. 



SPACEMAN!

She stayed in for half an hour, 
stroking up and down as unconcern- 
ed as if she were in the pool at 
some high-priced resort at Miami 
Beach. Once or twice she ducked 
under and stayed so long I found 
myself wading in to look for her. 
After the second time I complain- 
ed, and she laughed and promised 
to stay on top. 

“Verily hast thou found a garden 
in the wilderness, Billy Danger,” 
she said after she had her clothes 
back on. “‘Tis so peaceful — and 
in its rude way, so fair.” 

“Not much like home, though, I 
guess, Milady,” I said. But she 
changed the subject, as she always 
did when the conversation brought 
back too many memories. 

In the next few days, I made two 
trips back to the car, brought in 
everything that looked as if it might 
be useful; then we settled down to 
what I might describe as a very quiet 
routine. She strolled around, climb- 
ed the rocks, brought home small 
green shrubs and flowers that she 
planted around the caves and along 
the path and watered constantly, 
using a pot made of clay from the 
poolside cooked by a Z gun on wide 
beam. I spent my time exploring 
to the west and north and trying 
to make friends with the cats. 

There were plenty of them; at 
certain times of the day, there’d be 
as many as ten in sight at one 
time, around the water hole. They 
didn’t pay much attention to us; 
just watched us when we came 
toward them, and at about fifteen 
feet, rose casually and moved off 
into the thick growth along the ra- 



vine. They were well fed and lazy, 
just nice hearth-side tabbies, a little 
larger than usual. 

There was one with a few streaks 
of orange in among the black and 
tan that I concentrated on, mainly 
because I could identify him easily. 
Every time I saw him I’d go out 
and move up as close as I could 
without spooking him, sit down and 
start to play with a ball of string 
from the car. He sat and watched. 
I’d roll it toward him, then pull it 
back. He moved in closer. I let him 
get a paw on it, then jerked it. He 
went after it and cuffed it, and I 
pulled it in and tossed it out again. 

I n a week the game was a regular 
routine. In two, he had a name — 
Eureka — and was letting me 
scratch him between the ears. In 
three, he had taken to lying across 
the mouth of my cave, not even 
moving when I stepped over him 
going out. 

The Lady Raire watched all this 
with a sort of indulgent smile. Ac- 
cording to her, cats were pets on 
most of the human inhabited world 
she knew of. She wasn’t sure where 
they had originated, but she smiled 
when I said they were a native of 
Earth. 

“In sooth, Billy Danger, ’tis a 
truism that each unschooled mind 
fancies itself the center of the Uni- 
verse. But the stars were seeded by 
Man long ago, and by his chattels 
with him.” 

At first, the Lady Raire didn’t 
pay much attention to my pet, but 
one day he showed up limping, and 
she spent half an hour carefully re- 



30 



IF 




moving a splinter from 'his foot. The 
next day she gave him a bath, and 
brhshed his fur to a high gloss. After 
that, he took to following her on 
her walks. And it wasn’t long before 
he took to sleeping at the mouth 
of her cubbyhole. He got more pet- 
ting that way. 

I watched the cats, trying to see 
what it was they fed on, on the 
theory that whatever they ate we 
could eat too. Our concentrates 
wouldn’t last forever. But I never 
saw them pounce on anything. They 
came to the water hole to drink and 
lie around in the shade; then they 
wandered off again into the under- 
growth. One day I decided to follow 
Eureka. 

“An thou wilt,” the Lady Raire 
said, smiling at me. “Tho* I trow 
thy cat o’ mountain lives on naught 
but moonbeams.” 

“Baked moonbeam for dinner 
coming up,” I said. 

The cat led me up the rocks and 
through the screen of alien foliage 
at the north side of the hollow, then 
struck out along the edge of the 
ravine, which was filled from edge 
to edge by a mass of deep-green 
vines. 

The chasm was about three hun- 
dred yards long, fifty yards wide; I 
couldn’t see the bottom under the 
tangle of green, but I could make 
out the big stems, as thick as my 
leg, snaking down into the deep 
shadows for at least a hundred feet. 
And I could see the cats. They lay 
in crotches of the big vine, walked 
delicately along the thick stems, 
peered out of shadows with green 
eyes. There were a few up on the 



rim, sitting on their haunches, 
watching me watching them. Eureka 
yawned and switched his tail against 
my thigh, then made a sudden leap 
and disappeared into the green 
gloom. By getting down on all fours 
and shading my eyes, I could see 
the broad branch he’d jumped to. f 
could have followed, but the idea 
of going down into the maze full of 
cats lacked appeal. I got up and 
started off along the rim. I noticed 
that it was scattered with what look- 
ed like chips of thick eggshell. 

'T'he ravine shallowed out to 

A nothing at the far end. The 
vines were less dense here, and I 
could see rock strata slanting down 
into the depths. There were strange 
knobs and shafts of blackish rock 
imbedded in the lighter stone, I 
found one protruding near the sur- 
face and saw that it was a fossilized 
bone. The rock was full of them. 
That would be a matter of deep in- 
terest to a paleontologist specializ- 
ing in the fauna of Gar 28, but it 
was no help to me. I needed live 
meat. If there was any around — 
excepting the cats, and I didn’t like 
the idea of eating them, for six or 
eight reasons I could think of off- 
hand — it had to be down below, 
in the shade of the greenery. The 
descent looked pretty easy, here at 
the end of the cut. I hitched my 
gun around front for quick access, 
and started down. 

The rock slanted off under me at 
an angle of about thirty degrees. 
The big vines bending up over my 
head were tough, woody, scaled with 
dead-looking bark. Only a few green

tendrils curled up 'here, reaching 
for sunlight. The air was fresh and 
cool in the shade of the big leaves; 
there was a sharp, pungent odor of 
green life, mixed with the rank 
smell of cat. Fifty feet down the 
broken slope the growth got too 
thick to be ignored; it was switch 
over to limb-climbing or go back. 

I went on. 

It was easy going at first. The 
stems weren’t too close together to 
push between, and there was still 
plenty of light to see by. I could 
hear the cats moving around, back 
deeper in the growth. I reached a 
major stem, as big as my torso, and 
started down it. There were plenty 
of handholds here. Big seed pods 
hung in clusters near me. A lot of 
them had been gnawed, either by the 
cats or by what the cats ate. So far 
I hadn’t seen any signs of the lat- 
ter. 

I broke off one of the pods. 
It was about a foot long, knobby 
and pale green. It broke open 
easily and half a dozen beans as big 
as egg yolks rolled out. I took a 
nibble of one. It tasted like raw 
beans. After a couple of weeks on 
concentrates, even that was good — 
if it didn’t kill me. 

I went down. The light was deep 
green now, a luminous dusk filter- 
ed through a hundred feet of foli- 
age. The trunk I was following 
curved sharply, and I worked my 
way around to the up side, descend- 
ed another ten feet, and my feet 
thunked solidly against something 
hard. I had to get down on all fours 
to see that I was on a smooth, 
curving surface of tarnished metal. 



Something thumped beside me like 
O a dropped blanket; it was 
Eureka, coming over to check on 
me. He sat and washed his face 
while I rooted around the base of 
the big vine, saw that it was grow- 
ing out through a fracture in the 
metal. The wood had bulged and 
spread and shaped itself to conform 
to the opening. I had the impression 
that it was the vine that had burst 
the metal. 

By crawling, I was able to explore 
an oval area about fifteen feet long 
by ten wide before the vines slanted 
in too close to let me move. All of 
it was the same iodine-colored metal, 
with no seams, no variations in con- 
tour, with the exception of the bulge 
around the break. If I wanted to see 
more, I’d have to do a little land- 
clearance. I got out the pistol and 
set it on needle-beam, cut enough 
wood away to get a look into a room 
the size of a walk-in freezer, almost 
filled with an impacted growth of 
wood. 

I backed out then, wormed my 
way over to the big trunk and climb- 
ed back to the surface. There was a 
lot more to see, but what I wanted 
to do now was get back in a h^ury 
and tell the Lady Raire that under 
the vines in the ravine I’d found a 
full-sized spaceship. 

VIII 

F ifteen minutes later, she stood on 
the rim of the ravine with me. 
I could dimly make out the whole 
three-hundred foot length of the ship, 
now that I knew what to look for. 
It was lying at an angle of about 



32 



IF 




fifteen degrees from the horizontal, 
the high end to the south. 

“It must have been caught by an 
earthquake,” I said. “Or a Gar- 
quake.” 

“I ween full likely she toppled 
thither,” the Lady Raire said. “Dur- 
ing a tempest, mayhap. Look thee, 
where a great fragment has fallen 
from the rim of the abyss. And see 
yon broken stones, crushed as she 
fell.” 

We found an access route near the 
south end, well worn by cats, and 
made an easier approach than my 
first climb. I led her to the hatch, 
and we spent the next hour burning 
the wood away from it, climbed 
through onto a floor that slanted 
down under a tangle of vine stem 
to a drift of broken objects half 
buried in black dirt at the low end. 
The air was cool and damp, and 
there was a sour smell of rotted 
vegetation and stagnant water. We 
waded knee deep in foul-smelling 
muck to a railed stair lying on its 
side, crawled along it to another 
open door. 

I stepped through into a narrow 
corridor, and a faint, greenish light 
sprang up. I felt the hair stand up on 
the back of my heck. 

“I misdoubt me not ’tis but an 
automatic system,” Milady said 
calmly. 

“Still working, after all this time?” 

“Why not? Twas built to endure.” 
She pointed to a dark opening in a 
wall. “Yon shaft should lead us to 
the upper decks.” She went past me, 
and I followed, feeling like a very 
small kid in a very large haunted 
castle. 



/T'he shaft led us to a grim-looking 
A place full of broken piping and 
big, dark shapes the size of moving 
vans that Milady said were primitive 
ion-pulse engines. There was plenty 
of breakage visible, but only a few 
dead tendrils of vine. We climbed 
on forward, found a storeroom, a 
plotting room full of still-shiny equip- 
ment, and a lounge where built-in 
furniture stuck out from what was 
now the wall. The living quarters 
were on the other side of the lounge 
and beyond there was a room with a 
ring of dark TV screens arching 
up overhead around a central po- 
dium that had snapped off at the 
base and was hanging by a snarl 
of conduits. Beyond that point, the 
nose of the ship was toe badly 
crushed to get into. There was no 
signs of the original owners around, 
with the possible exception of a 
few scraps that might have been hu- 
man bone. 

“What do you think, Milady?” I 
asked her. “Is there anything here 
we can use?” 

“If so, ’twere wonderful, Billy 
Danger. Yet would I see more ere I 
abandon hope.” 

Back in the hold, she spent some 
time crawling over the big vines 
that came coiling up from some- 
where down below. 

“Tis passing strange,” she said. 
“These stems rise not from soil, but 
rather burgeon from the bowels of 
the vessel. And meseemeth they 
want likeness to the other flora of 
this world.” 

I pulled one of the big, leathery 
leaves over to me. It was heart 
shaped, about eight inches wide.

“It looks like an ordinary pea to 
me,” I said. “Just overgrown — 
like the cats.” 

“We’ll trace these to their be be- 
ginnings, their mystery to resolve.” 
The Lady Raire pointed. “An* mine 
eyes deceive me not, they rise 
through yonder hatch.” 

There was just room to squeeze 
through between the thigh-thick 
trunks, into a narrow service shaft. I 
flashed my light along it and saw 
bones. 

“Just a cat,” I said, more to re- 
assure me than Milady. We went 
on, ducking under festoons of thick 
vine. We passed another cat skele- 
ton, well scattered. There was a 
strange smell, something like crush- 
ed almonds with an under-taint of 
decay. The vines led fifty feet along 
the passage, then in through a door 
that had been forced outward off 
its hinges. The room beyond was 
a dark mass of coiled white roots. 
On its far side, faint twilight shone 
in through a break in the hull. 
There was a soft clink, like water 
dripping into a still pond, a faint 
rustling. I flashed my light down. 
The floor of the big room slanted 
off sharply. Down among the 
snarled roots, a million tiny points 
of ambor light glowed. The Lady 
Raire took a step back. 

“Come, Billy Danger! I like this 
not!” 

That was as far as she got before 
the mass of vine roots in front of 
me trembled and bulged and all the 
devils in Hell came swarming out. 

Something dirty white, the size of 
O a football, jittering on six 



spindly legs rushed at me, clicking 
a pair of jaws that opened side- 
ways in a face like an imp in one 
of those medieval paintings. I jump- 
ed back and swung a kick and its 
biters clamped onto my boot toe 
like a steel trap. Another one 
bounced high enough to rip at my 
knee; the tough coverall held, but 
the hide under it tore. Something 
zapp'ed from behind my right ear 
and a flash of blue fire winked, and 
two of the things skittered away 
and a stink of burnt horn hit me 
in the face. All this in the first 
half second. I had my pistol up 
then, squeezing the firing lever, 
playing it over them like a hose. 
They curled and jumped and died 
and more came swarming over the 
dead ones. 

“We’re losing,” I yelled. “We’ve 
got to bottle them up!” The big 
vine stem was on fire, and sap was 
bubbling out and spitting in the 
flames. I ducked down and grabbed 
up a dead one and threw him into 
the opening, and beamed another 
one that poked his snout through 
and took a step and tripped and 
went flat on my face. I threw my 
hands up to protect my head and 
heard a yowl, and something dark 
bounded across me, and there was 
a snap and a thud and I sat up 
and saw Eureka, whirling and 
pouncing, batting with both paws. 
Behind him the Lady Raire, splash- 
ed to the knee with brown, a smear 
of blood on her cheek, was aiming 
and firing as steadily as if she were 
shooting at clay pipes at the county 
fair. And then Eureka was sitting 
on his haunches, making a face at

me, and the Lady Raire was turning 
toward me, and there was a last 
awkward scuffling sound and then 
silence. 

“Well, that answers one ques- 
tion,” I said. “Now we know what 
the cats eat.” 

I t was a hard climb back down 
along the lift shaft, out through 
the hold, and up to the last of the 
sunlight. She got out her belt medi- 
kit and started dabbing liquid fire 
into the cuts on my legs, back, 
arms and thighs. While she doctored, 
I talked. 

“That was the hydroponics room. 
When the ship crashed, or fell in 
the ravine, or got caught in an 
earthquake, the hull was opened 
there — or near enough that the 
plants could sense sunlight. They 
went for it. Either the equipment 
that watered them and provided 
the chemicals they needed was still 
working, or they found water and 
soil at the bottom of the ravine. 
Maybe both. They liked it here; 
plenty of sunshine, anyway. They 
adapted and grew and with no com- 
petition from other plant life, they 
developed into what we found.” 
“There may be truth in thy 
imaginings, Billy Danger,” Milady 
said. “The vessel’s of a very ancient 
type; ’tis like to those in use on 
Zeridajh some seven thousand years 
since. 

“That mi?ht he long enough for 
a plant to evolve giant size,” I said. 
“Especially if the local sun puts out 
a lot of hard radiation. Same for 
the cats. I guess there were a cou- 
ple of them aboard — or maybe 



just one pregnant female. She sur- 
vived the crash and found water 
and food — ” 

“Nay, Billy Danger. Thy Eureka 
may sup on such dainties as those 
he slew in they defense — but 
they’d make two snaps of any house- 
born puss.” 

“I didn’t mean that. A cat can 
live on beans, if it has to. Any- 
way, the critters weren’t as big 
then.” 

“How now? Knowest thou the 
history of Gar’s creatures as well 
as of more familiar kinds?” 

“They aren’t natives, any more 
than the cats and the peas. They 
came along on the ship. To be speci- 
fic, on the cat.” 

“Dost rave? Art feverish?” 

“I’m ashamed to admit it,” I said. 
“But I know a flea when I see one.” 

W e waited until daylight to go 
into the ship again. The loca- 
tion of the cat bones gave us a 
pretty good idea of where the boun- 
daries of flea territory were. Ap- 
parently they kept to their dark hold 
and lived long, happy lives sucking 
juice from the vines, or an occasion- 
al lone cat who meandered over the 
line. Population pressure drove 
enough of them upstairs to keep the 
cats supplied; and the cat droppings 
and their bodies when they died 
wound up at the bottom of the ra- 
vine, to keep the cycle going. 

The Lady Raire had the idea of 
trying to locate the ship’s communi- 
cation section. She finally did — 
in the smashed nose section. 

I crawled in beside her to look 
at the ruins of what had once been 



SPACEMAN!

a message center that could bounce 
words and music across interstellar 
distances at a speed that was a 
complicated multiple of the speed 
©f light Now it looked like a junk- 
man’s nightmare. 

‘’Alack, I deemed I might fine 
here a signaler, in tact. ’Twere fol- 
ly — and yet . 

She sounded so down-hearted that 
I had to say something to cheer her 
up. 

“There’s an awful lot of gear ly- 
ing around in there,” I said. “May- 
be we could salvage something.” 

“Dost know aught of these mat- 
ters, Billy Danger?” she said in a 
lofty tone. 

“Not much,” I said. “I know my 
way around the inside of an or- 
dinary radio. I’m not talking about 
sending three-D pictures in glorious 
color; hut maybe a simple sig- 
nal ” 

She wanted to know more. I ex- 
plained all I’d learned from ICS 
one summer when I had the idea 
of Getting Into Radio Now. I felt 
like an unspoiled native of Borneo 
explaining flint-chipping techniques 
to a designer of H-bombs. 

It took us a week to assemble a 
transmitter capable of putting out 
a simple signal that Milady Raire 
assured me would show up as a 
burst of static on any screen with- 
in a couple of light-years We led 
a big cable from the energy cells 
that powered the stand-by lighting 
system, rigged it so that what juice 
was in them would drain in one fi- 
nal burst. The ship itself would act 
as an antenna, once we’d wired our 
fig to the hull. We climbed out of 



her dragging a length of coaxial 
cable, got back a couple of hun- 
dred yards in case of miscalcula- 
tion with the power core, and 
touched her off. For a couple of 
seconds, nothing happened; then I 
felt a tremor run through the 
ground and a moment later a dull 
ka-whoom! rumbled up from the 
chasm, followed by a rapid exodus 
of cats. For the next hour, there 
was a lot of activity: cats chasing 
fleas, fleas bouncing around look- 
ing for cover and the Lady R. 
Raire and me trying to stay ouit of 
the way of both parties. Then the 
smoke faded away, the fleas scuttled 
for cover, the cats went back down 
to lie under the leaves or wandered 
off in the direction of the water 
hole, and Milady and I settled down 
to wait. 

I made the discovery that by cut- 
ting into a vine just below a leaf, 
I could get a trickle of cool water. 
The Lady Raire had the" idea of 
hauling a stem out and getting it 
growing in the direction of the 
caves; we did, and it grew en- 
thusiastically. By the time we’d been 
in residence for another month, we 
had shade and running water on tap 
right outside the door. 

I asked the Lady Raire to teach 
me her language, and along with 
the new words I learned a lot about 
her home world, Zeridajh. It was 
old — fifty thousand years of writ- 
ten history — but the men there 
were still men. It was no classless 
Utopia where people strolled in 
misty gardens spouting philosophy, 
There was plenty of strife and un-

IF 




happiness, and although the Lady 
Raire never talked about herself, I 
got the impression she had her share 
of the latter. I wondered how it hap- 
pened that she was off wandering 
the far end of the Galaxy in the 
oompany of two unlikely types like 
Lord Desroy and Sir Orfeo, but I 
didn’t ask her. If she wanted to tell 
me, she could. But one day I said 
something that made her laugh. 

“I thought — Sir Orfeo said Lord 
Desroy had been on Earth three 
hundred years ago. And you speak 
the same old-fashioned English — ” 
She laughed. “Billy Danger, didst 
deem me so ancient?” 

“No — but — ” 

“I learned my English speech 
from Lord Desroy, somewhat alter- 
ed, mayhap, by Sir Orfeo. But ’twas 
late; indeed, I have but eighteen 
years, Earth reckoning.” 

“And you’ve been away from 
home for four years? Isn’t your 
family worried?” Then I shut up, 
at the look that crossed her face. 

The weather had been gradually 
changing; the days grew shorter and 
cooler. The flowers milady had 
brought in from the caves dropped 
their blossoms and turned brown. 
The cats got restless, and we’d hear 
them yowling and scrapping, down 
in their leafy den. And one day, 
there were kittens everywhere. 

Our diet consisted of beans, 
fried, baked, sliced and eaten raw, 
chopped and roasted, mixed with 
food concentrates to make stews 
and soups. We used the scissors 
from the first-aid kit to trim our 
hair back. Fortunately, I had no 
beard to trim. The days got longer 



again, and for a while the ravine 
was a fairyland of blossoms that 
filled the air with a perfume so 
sweet it was almost dizzying. At 
sunset, the Lady Raire would walk 
out across the desert and look at 
the purple towers in the west. I 
trailed her, with a gun ready, in 
case any of Sir Orfeo’s direbeasts 
wandered this way. 

And one night the ship came. 

IX 

I was sound asleep; the Lady 
Raire woke me and I rolled out 
grabbing for my gun and she point- 
ed to a star that glared blue and 
got bigger as we watched it. It came 
down in absolute silence and ground 
in the desert a quarter of a mile 
from us in a pool of blue light that 
cast hard shadows across Milady’s 
face. I was so excited I could hard- 
ly breathe, but she wasn’t smiling. 

“The lines of yon vessel are 
strange to me, Billy Danger,” she 
said. “’Tis of most archaic appear- 
ance. Seest thou the double hull, 
like unto the body of an insect?” 
“All I can see is the glare from 
the business end.” The blue glow 
was fading. Big floodlights came on 
and lit up the desert all around the 
ship like high noon. 

“Mayhap . .” she started, and 
a whistling, whooping noise boom- 
ed out across the flats. It stopped 
and the echoes bounced and faded 
and it was silent again. 

“If ’twere speech, I know it not,” 
Milady said. 

“I guess we’d better go meet 
them,” I said, but I had a powerful 



SPACEMAN! 



37 




urge to run and hide among the 
pea vines. 

“Bill Danger, I like this not.” 
Her hand gripped my arm. “Let’s 
flee to the shelter of the ravine.” 

Her idea was a little too close to 
mine; I had to show her how silly 
her feminine intuition was. 

“And miss the only chance we’ll 
ever have to get off this dust-ball? 
Come on, Milady. You’re going 
home.” 

“Nay, Bill — ” But I grabbed 
her arm and advanced. As we came 
closer, the ship looked as big as a 
wasp-waisted skyscraper. Three cars 
came around from the far side of it. 
Two of them fanned out to right 
and left; the third headed toward 
us, laying a dust trail behind it. 
It was squat, rounded, dark cop- 
pery colored without windows. It 
stopped fifty feet away with its 
blunt snout aimed at us. A round 
panel about a foot in diameter 
swung open and a glittery assembly 
poked out and rotated half a turn 
and was still. 

“It looks like it’s smelling of us,” 
I said, but the jolly note in my 
voice was a failure. Then a lid on 
top popped up like a jack-in-the- 
box, and the most incredible crea- 
ture I had ever seen climbed out. 

H e was about four feet high and 
almost as wide, and my first 
impression was that he was a dwarf 
in Roman armor; then I saw that 
the armor was part of him. He 
scrambled down the side of the car 
on four short, thick legs, then rear- 
ed his torso up, and I got a good 
look at the face set between a pair 



of seal flippers in the middle of his 
chest. It reminded me of a blown- 
up photo of a bat I’d seen once. 
There were two eyes, some orifices, 
lots of wrinkled gray-brown skin, a 
mouth like a fanged frog. An odd 
metallic odor came from him. He 
stared at us, and we stared back. 
Then a patch of rough, pinkish skin 
centered in a tangle of worms be- 
low his face bulged out, and a gluey 
voice came from it. I didn’t under- 
stand the words, but somehow he 
sounded cautious. 

The Lady Raire answered, speak- 
ing too fast for me to follow. I 
listened while they batted it back 
and forth. Once she glanced at me, 
and I caught my name and the word 
“property.” I wasn’t sure just how 
she meant it. While they talked, the 
other two cars came rumbling in 
from offside ringing us in. 

More of the midgets trotted up, 
holding what looked like stacks of 
silver teacups, glued together, the 
open ends toward us. The spokes- 
man took a step back and made a 
quick motion of his flippers. 

“Throw down guns,” he said in 
Zeridajhi. He didn’t sound cautious. 

The Lady Raire’s hand went 
toward her pistol. I grabbed her 
arm. 

“I know these hagseed now,” she 
said. “They mean naught but dire 
mischief to any of my race!” 
“Those are gunports under the 
headlights on the cars,” I said. “I 
think we’d better do what it says.” 
“If we draw and fire as one — ” 
“No use, Milady. They’ve got the 
drop on us.” 

I?

She hesitated a moment longer, 
then unsnapped her gunbelt and let 
it fall. I did the same. Our new 
friend made a noise and batted his 
flippers against his sides, and his 
gun-boys moved in. He pointed at 
the Lady Raire. 

“Fetter this one,” he said. “And 
kill the other.” 

Two or three things happened at 
once then. One of the teacup-guns 
swung my way, and the Lady Raire 
made a sound and threw herself at 
the gunner. He knocked her down, 
and I charged at him and something 
exploded in my face and for a long 
time I floated in a river, shooting 
the rapids, and each time I slammed 
against a submerged rock, I heard 
myself groan, and then I opened 
my eyes and I was lying on my face 
with my cheek in a puddle of con- 
gealing blood, and the ship and the 
monsters and the Lady Raire were 
gone. 

F or the first few hours my con- 
sciousness kept blinking on and 
off like a defective table lamp. I'd 
come to and try to move and the 
next thing I knew I was coming to 
again. Then suddenly it was day- 
light, and Eureka was sitting be- 
side me, yowling softly. This time 
I managed to roll over and raise 
my head far enough to see myself. 
I was a mess. 

There was blood all over me. I 
hurt all over, too, so that was no 
clue. I explored with my hands and 
found a rip in my coverall along my 
left side, and through that I could 



feel a furrow wide enough to lay 
two fingers in. Up higher, there 
was a hole in my right shoulder 
that seemed to come out in back; 
and the side of my neck felt like 
hamburger, medium rare. The pain 
wasn’t really as bad as you’d ex- 
pect. I must have been in shock. I 
flopped back and listened to all the 
voices around me. I heard Sir Or- 
feo: She's your responsibility now , 
Jongo. Take care of her . 

“I tried,” I said. “I really tried.” 

It's all right, the Lady Raire was 
standing by me, looking scared, but 
smiling at me. 1 trust you, Billy 
Danger . The light from the open 
furnace door glowed in her black 
hair, and she turned and stepped 
into the flames and I yelled and 
readied after her, but the fires leap- 
ed up and I was awake again, sob- 
bing. 

“They’ve got her,” I said aloud. 
“She was frightened of them, but 
I had to show off. I led her out to 
them like a lamb to the slaugh- 
ter .. .” I pictured her, dragged 
aboard the dwarves’ ship, locked 
away in a dark place, alone and 
terrified and with no one to help 
her. And she’d trusted me. 

“My fault,” I groaned. “My 
fault! But don’t be afraid, Milady. 
I’ll find you. They think I’m dead, 
but I’ll trick them; I won’t die. I’ll 
stay alive, and find them and take 
you home . 

T he next time I was aware of 
what was going on, the cat was 
gone and the sun was directly over- 
head and I was dying of thirst. By 
turning my head, I could see the 



40 



IF 




vines along the edge of the ravine. 
There was shade there and water. 
I got myself turned over on my 
stomach and started crawling. It 
was a long trip — nearly a hun- 
dred yards — and I passed out so 
many times I lost count. But I 
reached the vines and got myself 
a drink, and then it was dark. That 
meant it had been about seventy- 
two hours since the slug-people had 
done such a sloppy job of killing 
me. I must have slept for a long 
time, then. When I woke up 
Eureka was back, with a nice' fresh 
flea for me. 

“Thanks, boy,” I said when he 
dropped the gift on my chest and 
nudged me with his nose. “It’s nice 
to know somebody cares.” 

“You’re not dead yet,” he said, 
and his voice sounded like Orfeo’s. 
I called to him, but he was gone, 
down into the darkness. I followed 
him, along a trail of twisted vines, 
but the light always glimmered just 
ahead, and I was cold and wet and 
then the fleas came swarming out 
on the empty eyes of a giant skull 
and swarmed over me and I felt 
them eating me alive and I woke 
up, and I was still there, under the 
vines, and my wounds were hurting 
now and Eureka was gone and the 
flea with him. 

I got myself up on all fours to 
have another drink from the water 
vine and noticed a young bean pod 
sprouting nearby. I was hungry 
and I tore it open and ate the 
beans. And the next time I woke 
up, I was stronger. 

For five long Garish days I stay- 
ed under the vines; then I made 



the trek to the caves. After that, 
on a diet of concentrates, I gain- 
ed strength faster. I spent my time 
exercising my wounds so they 
wouldn’t stiffen up too much as 
they healed, and talking to the cat. 
He didn’t answer me any more, so 
I judged I was getting better. No 
infections set in; the de-lousing Sir 
Orfeo had given me probably had 
something to do with that, plus the 
absence of microbes on Gar 28. 

Finally a day came when it was 
time to get out and start seeing 
the world again. I slung my crater 
gun, not without difficulty, since 
my right arm didn’t want to co- 
operate, and made a hike around 
the far side of the ravine, with half 
a dozen rest stops. I was halfway 
back to the hut and the drink of 
water I’d promised myself as a re- 
ward, when the second ship came. 

X 

T his one was smaller, something 
like Lord Orfeo’s yacht, but 
with less of a polish. I hid behind 
the vines with my gun aimed un- 
til I saw what were undoubtedly 
men emerge. Then I went up to 
meet them. 

They were small, yellow-skinned, 
with round, bald heads. The captain 
was named Ancu-Uriru, and he 
spoke a little Zeridajhi. He frowned 
at my scars, which were pretty 
spectacular, and wanted to know 
where the rest of the ship’s comple- 
ment were. I told him there was 
just me. That made him frown 
worse than ever. It seemed he had 
picked up our signal and answered 



SPACEMAN!

it in the hope of collecting a nice 
reward from somebody, along with 
a little salvage. I told him about 
the ship in the ravine, and he sent 
a couple of men down who came 
back shaking their heads. They 
showed every sign of being ready 
to leave then. 

“What about me?” I asked Ancu- 
Uriru. 

“We leave you in peace,” he 
said in an offhand way. 

“There’s such a thing as too 
much peace,” I told him. “I want 
to go with you. I’ll work my way.” 

“I have no need of you; space is 
limited aboard my small vessel. And 
I fear your wounds render you 
somewhat less than capable to per- 
form useful labor. Here you are 
more comfortable. Stay, with my 
blessing.” 

“Suppose I told you where there 
was another ship, a luxury model, 
in perfect shape — if you can get 
the doors open?” 

That idea seemed to strike a 
spark. We dickered for a while, and 



there were hints that a little tor- 
ture might squeeze the answers out 
of me with no need for favors in 
return. But in the end we struck a 
deal. My passage to a civilized port 
in return for Lord Desroy’s yacht. 

It took them most of a Garish 
day to tickle her locks open. Ancu 
Uriru looked her over, then ordered 
his personal effects moved into the 
owners* suite. I was assigned to ride 
on his old tub along with a skele- 
ton crew. Just before boarding 
time, Eureka came bounding across 
the flats toward me. One of the 
men had a gun in his hand, and I 
jumped in front of him just in time. 

“This is my cat,” I told him. “He 
saved my life. We used to have long 
talks, while I was sick.” 

The men all seemed to be cat- 
lovers; they gathered around and ad- 
mired him. 

“Bring the beast along,” Ancu- 
Uriru said. We went aboard then, 
and an hour later the ship lifted off 
Gar 28, as nearly as I could calcu- 
late, one year after I had landed.

THE 

ROBOTS 
ARE HERE 

by TERRY CARR 



Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



The robots knew what they were 
doing, all right . they just 
wouldn't let humans in on it! 



I 

W hen it started, I had just fin- 
ished up the charts on our new 
rocket-propulsion system, and I felt 
a little funny. I sat back in my 
chair, lit a cigarette and reflected 
with an effort at sanguinity that 
we could now deliver more hell 



quicker to anywhere on Earth than 
ever before. I blew a smoke ring 
which drifted slowly toward the ceil- 
ing of my office, and I frowned 
at it. Damn it, with a two-year pro- 
ject wrapped up at last, I should 
have felt relief and elation, not some 
vague uneasiness. 

Nerves, I told myself. Overwork. 



43 




Time to go out and celebrate, shake 
the cobwebs out of the old pleasure 
centers. I reached for the telephone 
to call Betty at home. 

But then I thought of something: 
hadn’t Betty talked about a meeting 
of her damned Azalea Committee 
tonight? Hadn’t I written it down 
on a slip of paper in my wallet? I 
got out the wallet and looked. Yes, 
there was the note, and yes, damn 
it, that meeting was tonight. I mut- 
tered something halfway between a 
curse and a simple “Ah hell.” 

Then I saw another note, which 
had fallen onto the floor when I’d 
slipped out the first one. I picked it 
up and glanced at it: it was a phone 
number. I started to put it back into 
the wallet compartment. 

Wait a minute — whose phone 
number? I looked again and gradual- 
ly felt a frown creep onto my face. 
TTie number was a local exchange, 
but I didn’t recognize it. And it 
was written in my own handwriting 
— I have a particularly bad “3,” 
which looks sort of like a snake that 
didn’t know when to stop. The slip 
of paper had evidently been right 
behind the one with the note about 
Betty, so that ought to make it re- 
cent. 

But I couldn’t figure out whose 
number it was, and the note didn’t 
give any clue. 

Y ou ever have that happen to 
you? Or maybe you’re one of 
those guys who keeps his wallet in 
in order, nothing in it but money 
and credit cards and pictures of the 
wife and kids and maybe a pocket 
calendar. Me, I write notes to my- 



self about things to do when I get 
home or to the office, or names of 
books I want to look up someday, 
or the number of a cough medicine 
prescription or direction? to some- 
one’s house. And, of course, people’s 
phone numbers. Usually, though, I 
put their names down too. 

After about half a minute of 
frowning at the number I decided 
to shrug and forget it. So I put the 
paper back into my wallet and turn- 
ed to glance through the mail in my 
INCOMING tray. But the mail 
wasn’t interesting, nor even impor- 
tant, and my secretary could handle 
all of it anyway. I turned to my 
desk calendar, but there wasn’t any- 
thing on the agenda for today, not 
even a lunch date. I’d been so in- 
volved in the Project these last 
weeks that I’d gradually slipped out 
of the mainstream of executive work 
at the corporation. 

Hell. I sat back again, feeling 
definitely at loose ends. And I kept 
thinking about that silly phone num- 
ber. 

Anybody with the stuff to get a 
four-window office in the high-pres- 
sure world of 1982 has to be a de- 
cisive man, I told myself. I took out 
the slip of paper with the number 
on it, picked up my phone and 
punched out the number. 

A tinny woman’s voice on the 
other end said, “877-0313.” (Or 
some such number.) 

“Hello,” I said. “May I ask what 
company this is?” 

There were two clicks, then one. 
The tinny voice said, “877-0313.” 

“Excuse me,” I said, speaking 
more loudly this time. “I think we

have a bad connection. I was asking 
what company this is.” 

More clicks. “What is your name, 
please?” asked the voice. 

“Is this an answering service?” 
I asked. 

“What is your name, please?” the 
voice asked again. 

I sighed. Yes, it sounded like 
some answering service that wasn’t 
about to give out any information 
unless you were on the Approved 
List. 

“This is Charles Barrow. I don’t 
know if you — ” 

Click. Click click. “Your appoint- 
ment is at five o’clock this after- 
noon,” the voice said. “723 Madi- 
son, Room 1100.” 

“My what?” I said. “Look, really, 
I don’t even know who I’m talking 
to. What appointment?” 

“Five o’clock this afternoon. 723 
Madison, Room 1100.” Then there 
was a final click, as she hung up 
abruptly. 

For a minute I stared at the sud- 
denly dead phone; then I laughed. 
Then I stopped and wondered if I 
ought to be annoyed. I wasn't an- 
noyed, but I thought maybe I should 
be. 

What kind of business could af- 
ford to antagonize customers with 
that kind of flagrant disrespect, any- 
way? 

Which brought me right back to 
what I’d been wondering about 
when I’d called: who was that on 
the other end? 

I looked at my desk calendar 
again, and it was still blank. Sighing, 
I wrote on it, Appt 723 Mad Rm 
1100 — 5:00. 



7 23 Madison was a big, square 
office building like most of the 
newly constructed people-boxes in 
that area. It had a glass revolving 
door leading into a large lobby serv- 
iced by eight automatic elevators. 
At that hour of the day most people 
were just leaving work; I caught an 
elevator as it disgorged a load of 
them and rode alone up to the 
eleventh floor. 

Room 1100 was at the end of the 
hall on my right: a nondescript door 
with a frosted-glass window lettered 
R.O.B.O.T. I paused, looking at 
that; then I knocked and entered. 

For a minute I didn’t see the re- 
ceptionist. There was a teak desk, 
imitation Danish midcentury, with 
some papers on it and a telephone 
switchboard behind it. Next to the 
switchboard, behind the desk, was 
a whirring and clicking mass of 
polished steel with metal arms that 
ran on visible pulleys, a round globe 
on top from which a web of tele- 
phone wires ran into the switch- 
board, and a spring-steel neck be- 
neath this globular “head.” As I 
hesitated inside the door, a familiar 
tinny voice issued from a grille 
where the machine might have had 
a mouth. 

“What is your name, please?” the 
voice asked. 

I -stared for a moment, caught off 
guard. Robots of one sort or an- 
other were in common use in a lot of 
industries these days (though sel- 
dom along the Madison Avenue cir- 
cuit), but the construction of this 
one struck me as bizarre in the ex-

treme. Then the receptionist clicked 
once and twice and said, “Your 
appointment is at nine o’clock to- 
morrow morning,” and I realized it 
was speaking into the phone. “723 
Madison, Room 1100,” it said. 

I waited for it to go through its 
cycle. 

“Nine o’clock tomorrow morning. 
723 Madison, Room 1100,” it said, 
and one of the lines in the switch- 
board pulled itself out and snaked 
back down into the panel at its base. 
The receptionist whirred, then re- 
volved to face me. 

“My name is Charles Barrow,” 
I said. “I have an appointment.” 

“Yes, Mr. Barrow,” the tinny fe- 
male voice said. “Will you be seat- 
ed, please.” The machine revolved 
back to face its switchboard. 

I sat down on the couch and took 
a few moments lighting a cigarette 
to gather my thoughts. Here I was 
at the office, and I still hadn’t solved 
the silly question which had brought 
me here: what was this place? 

I leaned forward and asked con- 
versationally, “What does R.O.B. 
O.T. stand for, anyway?” 

“R.O.B.O.T. spells ‘robot,’” the 
receptionist said without turning. 

“I know,” I said. “But what is 
R.O.B.O.T .?” 

There was a ripid whirr inside 
the machine, then it said, “Robot, 
noun: An automatic apparatus or 
device that performs functions or- 
dinarily ascribed to human beings 
or operates with what appears to be 
almost human intelligence.” 

“That’s fine,” I said patiently. 
“But what is this place, this organi- 
zation?” 



The receptionist clicked twice. 
“877-0313,” it said. Then it clicked 
some more. “What is your name, 
please?” 

I sighed. “I’m Charles Barrow. I 
have an appointment for five 
o’clock.” 

“Yes, Mr. Barrow. Will you be 
seated, please.” 

I sat back and waited. 

H alf a hour later I was still sit- 
ting there and getting irritated. 
I’m not used to being kept waiting. 
I was debating with myself whether 
to try communicating my displeasure 
to the obviously limited robot re- 
ceptionist or to simply to walk out. 
I could phone Betty and maybe con- 
vince her to let the azaleas evolve 
by themselves for one more week, 
and we could still make a night of 
it. 

I decided just to walk out. Pick- 
ing up my hat, I stood up — and 
the receptionist gave a rapid click- 
clickclickclick and said, “You may 
go in now.” 

I hesitated, looking at the impas- 
sive metal globe-face with the tele- 
phone cords running to the switch- 
board. Like a metal Medusa, I 
thought angrily. You’re supposed to 
look at it and turn to stone so that 
you’ll wait until whoever the hell’s 
inside finally gets around to seeing 
you. 

Whoever the hell’s inside . 
That was what did it. There’d be 
no use in telling off the under-pro- 
grammed robot receptionist, but the 
man inside was a different matter. 
Setting an appointment for five 
o’clock, then keeping me wait- 



46 



IF 




ing .... Yes, he deserved a word 
or two. 

The receptionist was pointing a 
level metal arm to a door on my 
right. I turned and went through 
it. 

On the other side was a long hall, 
wide and empty like a hospital cor- 
ridor, except that some distance 
down it I could see a couple of 
figures scurrying along from one 
room to another opening off the 
hall. They were robots too — the 
one I saw most clearly ran on two 
wheels and had a series of metal 
arms ending in wrenchlike “hands.” 
It turned its small head toward me 
briefly, and I saw bright green eyes; 
then it disappeared into a room. 

Out of the door nearest to me 
along the hall came another robot, 
this one tall and slender, basically 
manlike in construction: two legs 
and two arms, a torso and a head. 
The head had three red circles about 
where you’d expect eyes and a 
mouth, and as it turned and ap- 
proached I saw that this was ap- 
parently the case, for the eyes were 
faceted like a bee’s and the mouth 
was a speaker-grille. 

It stumped up to me on its metal 
feet, stopped and said politely, 
“Please follow me.” Then, without 
waiting for an answer, it turned and 
led me down the hall. 

I followed. 

We went all the way to the end, 
where the corridor branched right, 
then turned to follow that one. Oc- 
casional robots passed us in the hall: 
yellow ones, blue ones, gray ones; 
short, squat floorsweepers brushing 
by on broom-feet; inspector-robots 



with rows of eyes circling tubular 
bodies at top and bottom, minutely 
checking the flooring and plaster; 
strange-shaped repair robots like the 
one I’d seen before, with wrenches 
or screwdrivers or cutting tools for 
hands; and quite a few with such 
a variety of peculiar extensors, 
sense-organs, manipulators and oth- 
er paraphernalia that I had no idea 
what they were for. 

The second corridor was about a 
city block long. My robot guide took 
me to the end of that and turned 
right again. Another long hall lay 
ahead, no different from the two 
we’d already passed. 

“Just how much further are we 
going?” I asked, catching up with 
the long-limbed robot and striding 
beside it. 

“Please follow me,” it said with- 
out turning its head. 

A suspicion came to me. “Say, did 
you know your left arm has fallen 
off?” I asked. 

“Please follow me,” it said, not 
pausing tc look. 

“Your head is coming unscrew- 
ed!” I said more urgently. 

“Please follow me,” it said. 

There hadn’t even been the soft 
clicking that the receptionist had 
made when switching to its pro- 
grammed response. Either this one 
had nothing else to say, or I hadn’t 
hit the right verbal button. I kept 
following for awhile, my annoyance 
growing as my feet got tired. I’m 
not a peripatetic man. 

W e came to the end of this third 
corridor and turned right. The 
robot guide kept going as impassive- 



48 



IP 




ly as ever, and down at the end of 
the hall I saw a door which looked 
suspiciously like the one I’d come 
in by. I stopped. 

“Now just a damn minute!” I 
said. “You’ve taken me around in a 
circle!” 

“Please follow me.” 

“The hell I will! I’m leaving!” 

That did it. Whirr, clickclick went 
the robot. “This is the room,” it 
said, striding to the nearest door 
and opening it for me. 

I stood still for a moment, look- 
ing past my guide-robot into the 
room. It was a fairly small cubi- 
cle, about a third the size of my 
own office, with no rug and no 
windows. There was just a green 
leather swivel chair in the middle of 
the room, and facing it was a large 
robot which seemed to be all head, 
and that head all one eye. The head 
with the eye turned slowly to gaze 
at me. 

I don’t know exactly what I’d been 
expecting at the end of the trail. 
What kind of appointment would 
a man make and then forget? Den- 
tist? Analyst? Tax consultant? Well, 
whatever I’d had in mind, it had in- 
volved a human, not a one-eyed 
robot. 

But I was here now, and curiosity 
is a great motivating force when 
you have time on your hands. I 
stepped into the room. 

The guide-robot shut the door be- 
hind me, and I heard a faint click 
— not the whirr-clickclick kind they 
made in sorting their programs, but 
a locking kind of click. I turned 
quickly and grabbed the door han- 
dle. 



“Please sit down,” said a voice 
from the air around me. 

The door was locked. 

“Please sit down,” said the voice. 

I looked around the room, search- 
ing for another exit, knowing there 
wouldn’t be any. Now, too late, it 
finally occurred to me that I was 
an important man in the Western 
Bloc’s defense industry, and that 
the whole thing about me making 
an appointment and then forgetting 
it was more than just curious — it 
was damned fishy. 

And here I was. 

“Please sit down.” 

I looked wearily at the big robot 
in front of the chair. It didn’t seem 
to have any threatening protuber- 
ances; indeed, it was more or less 
shapeless except for that head with 
the huge eye. Cautiously, I sat in 
the leather swivel chair facing it. 

Immediately the robot’s eye start- 
ed spinning. I realized suddenly that 
the iris was marked with spiral lines, 
and now that the eye was spinning 
it seemed like a whirlpool, a vor- 
tex of. light which had instantly 
caught the focus of my gaze and 
was trying to pull me down, down 
and into the dark pupil at the center. 
Down, down . 

“Down, down, down,” I heard a 
voice saying, slowly and monoto- 
nously. “Down ...” 

I blinked and sat up from my 
partially slumped position in the 
chair. “Like hell,” I said. 

“Sleep,” said the voice. “You 
must sleep. Sleep, sleep. Down into 
sleep ...” 

“No,” I said, and looked away 
from the eye. 



THE ROBOTS ARE HERE 



49 




The voice stopped; there was a 
long, echoless silence in the room. 
The lights dimmed into darkness. 
Then I heard two soft robot-clicks, 
and the voice said, “You are now 
asleep.” 

“No, I’m not,” I said. 

“You will remain asleep for 
exactly one hour,” said the voice, 
“and then you will awaken and 
leave this building and go to your 
home. You will not remember hav- 
ing been here; you will think you 
have been to a movie theater. You 
will throw away the note with our 
telephone number and also the page 
from your desk calendar contain- 
ing this address, which you have in 
your shirt pocket.” 

My chair swiveled gently to face 
a blank wall, where a picture sprang 
into being: it was the opening cre- 
dits of an African movie with sub- 
titles. “You will open your eyes 
and watch the motion picture,” said 
the voice, and then the soundtrack 
cut in over the hidden loudspeaker. 

Ill 

I stood up and made my way to 
the door. If they thought I was 
asleep, maybe they’d have unlocked 
the door. If so, maybe I could get 
out and away — I wasn’t far from 
the exit door at the end of the 
hall. 

I tried the doorknob, but it was 
unlocked. Holding my breath, I 
eased it open. 

The guide-robot was right out- 
side, blocking the doorway, staring 
blankly at me with its red bee-eyes. 
The robot gave a rapid, Geigerlike 



clicking and said, “You are awake.” 

I tried to shove past, but the ro- 
bot stretched its long steel arms out 
across the doorway and held me 
back. I ducked and tried to go 
under the arms, but there wasn’t 
enough room — the robot was ad- 
vancing into the doorway. It kept 
up that rapid clicking and sputter- 
ing. “You are awake. Go back into 
the room. Go back into the room.” 

I had no choice; I was forced 
back. The robot stepped back out- 
side again, and once more it shut 
the door. This time the click of 
the lock wasn’t faint. 

Behind me the movie soundtrack 
groaned to a stop, and the lights 
came back on. The loudspeaker- 
voice said, “You are awake. This 
is very unusual.” 

“I was always a lousy subject 
for hypnotism. But I kept my eyes 
away from the Cyclopean robot just 
the same. “You’d better let me out 
of here. I left word at my office 
where I was going. If I turn up 
missing, the FBI will know just 
where to look.” 

“You left no word at your of- 
fice,” said the voice. “That was 
checked, of course. We are always 
efficient.” 

“But you seem to have messed up 
this time,” I pointed out. 

“Yes. Very unusual. I am coming 
to see you,” said the voice, and 
almost simultaneously I heard the 
lock behind me turn, and the door 
opened. 

A small robot rolled through the 
door, which shut and locked behind 
it. Its head was about two feet in 
diameter, and it seemed to run on 



50 



IF 




roller-skate wheels. Three black but- 
tons, apparently eyes, were arrang- 
ed in a triangle near the top of its 
face, and four small arms no more 
than five inches long extended from 
the sides, ending in tiny hands with 
articulated fingers. The head and 
body were all one metal globe; it 
looked like a confused beach ball, 
especially with its round red speaker- 
grille, like a mouth gaping open. 

“That’s you?” I said unbelieving- 

ly- 

His voice (the robot’s appearance 
was so unprepossessing that I im- 
mediately thought of it as “he”) 
sounded a trifle hurt as he said, 
“Yes, I am me — first official in 
charge of Madison Avenue Baili- 
wick Four. I happen to be a very 
complicated machine, programmed 
for self-determination of actions and 
with a vocabulary of 97,432 words, 
English language 1982 Track Four- 
teen. Microminiaturization and our 
latest advances in DNA-simulation 
make all this possible.” 

“Who the hell is we?” I asked, 
turning to follow him as he rolled 
past me into the center of the room. 
He rolled to a stop in front of the 
swivel chair, and with one of his 
pencil-thin arms motioned me to 
sit. I couldn’t see any reason not to, 
so I did. 

66XJow then,” he said, and his 
round body-head seemed to 
lean back on its roller-skate base. 
“We can get down to business. I 
admire a man who can get down to 
business. No shilly-shallying, no 
beating for birds in the bush. Right?” 
He waved a hand before I could 



open my mouth. “Don’t bother to 
answer; I know you agree. Were 
you to answer, it would only waste 
valuable time. And we are in the 
process of getting down to business, 
are we not?” 

“I hope so,” I said. 

“Good. Good.” He waved his 
arms again. “Very good indeed. 
Now then — you ask, ‘Who is weT 
A very good question. It strikes to 
the heart. That is, it is incisive, 
trenchant, acute, penetrating. Yes?” 

“I thought so,” I muttered. 

“Ah!” he said. “Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah- 
ah! That is my simulation of a 
human laugh — very good, I be- 
lieve. I laugh because you employ 
irony upon my statement, a peculiar- 
ly human communication form. I 
am able through the sophistication 
of my analysis-patterns to detect and 
respond to this.” 

“Terrific,” I said. 

“Ah! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah ! Now 
then, I will tell you who we are. 
Though, to be frank, you may not 
believe me at first. I am aware of 
the unfortunate limitations which 
even humans had in 1982 Track 
Fourteen. Listen carefully and with 
an open mind, then: We are ro- 
bots.” 

He stopped, peering at me with 
his triangle of button-eyes and 
clicking faintly inside. 

“I believe you,” I said. 

“Yes? You do? Or do I detect 
irony? Aa-ah?” 

“No,” I told him. “I do believe 
you. You look like a robot, you 
know.” 

“Ah,” he said. “Yes. An accur- 
ate observation, accurate indeed.”

“Thanks,” I said sourly. “Now 
that that's settled, how about tell- 
ing me where you’re from? What do 
you want? And why the hell did you 
get me here and try to hypnotize 
me?” 

He nodded, and since his head 
was also his body the gesture came 
out looking like a bow. A tin beach 
ball with old-world charm, I thought. 
Oh boy. 

“Again you ask questions which 
are to the tip,” he said approvingly. 
“Let me then be forthright, since I 
admire forthrightness. Wastes no 
time. Where are we from? Yes, ex- 
cellent questioning, but not quite 
accurate. Rather, when are we from? 
You see the distinction — when 
rather than where? Yes, I see you 
nod. Good. All right, then: We are 
from the future.” 



“From the future,” I said. 

He cocked his head, leaning side- 
ways on his roller-skate base as he 
peered beadily at me. “Ah-ah?” he 
asked. 

“Not quite,” I said. “Don’t wor- 
ry about that — just go on with your 
story.” 

“Ah, yes. Well, we are from the 
future. Or rather, from a future. Our 
base is 2044, Track Seven. That is, 
Time Track Seven. You are familiar 
with the idea of infinitely branching 
time tracks?” 

“Somewhat. That’s the theory that 
at any moment in history there are 
an infinite number of possible fu- 
tures, depending on small decisions, 
random factors and so on. Each 
possible future is a different, uh, 
time track.” 

“Quite yes. You understand well 



52 



IF 



— that is with precision — the 
theory. And you will understand 
me when I say that this theory is 
absolutely correct, though now 
dated. There were once an infinite 
number of time tracks, but now 
there are only fifty-eight of them.” 
“What does that mean?” 

H e hesitated, then gave his little 
nod-bow. 

“I see I must explain at greater 
extension. At one time — subjective- 
ly speaking — there were indeed a 
limitless number of histories for 
humanity, an infinity of them 
branching from each moment in 
time. Very messy. But we would 
not have changed this except that in 
so many of these alternate tracks 
mankind came to harm. Wars, 
plagues, ecological imbalances, nat- 
ural disasters of worldwide scope, 
and many ceteras . As robots we 
could not allow this, you see, so 
once we had developed time travel 
we began our work to improve 
things. We have so far eliminat- 
ed — ” He paused, then did rapid 
calculations on the first two fingers 
of his left hand. “We have so far 
eliminated four million, three hun- 
dred and sixty-seven thousand, seven 
hundred and two worldwide pesti- 
lences. Also — ” more finger- 
counting “ — eight hundred and 
twenty-six wars which substantially 
destroyed mankind. Or perhaps the 
figure is sixteen hundred and fifty- 
two. But you see what I mean, at 
any speed.” 

I abruptly realized that I was 
staring at him. I cleared my throat 
self-tconsciously and said. “You mean 



you’re really from the future? And 
you and all these other robots are 
. uh, fixing up history?” 

“Indeed yes. It is necessary for 
the good of mankind, which is of 
course our prime directive; we can- 
not allow men to be harmed, or even 
to harm themselves.” The robot 
emitted a gust of air which sounded 
peculiarly like a sigh. “It was com- 
paratively easy before we discovered 
time travel; but once the past was 
open to us we owned no choice, 
but to accept the additional respon- 
sibility. So we have launched our 
great campaign to restructure all 
histories. And we are now ap- 
proaching a degree of success, since 
in all of the fifty-eight remaining 
tracks we have kept mankind alive 
up through the year 1982. We are 
of course continually working to 
extend that date as well as to im- 
prove the quality of the tracks. 
The more humans alive on a given 
track the better it is, you see.” 
“Wait a minute, wait a minute,” 
I said. A chill was creeping up the 
back of my neck. “You say you’ve 
kept us alive up through this year. 
What about next year? Are we dead 
then? Is that why you’re here now?” 
For several long seconds the robot 
sat silently, his only sound that faint 
clicking inside, like a computer mut- 
tering to itself. Then he said, “I 
cannot tell you about the future of 
your particular track, since our hyp- 
notreaitment has had no effect on 
you. You are one in a million, you 
know — our technique is very effi- 
cient, very refined, very complicat- 
ed. It is not merely hypnotism, but 
a combination of that with acoustics, 



room temperature, the psych-index 
which we recorded while you were in 
the reception room — ” 

“Yes, what about that?” I broke 
in. “Why did you keep me waiting 
there? Why did you give me the run- 
around in that hallway till I finally 
threatened to walk out on you?” 

IV 

A gain the robot was silent, its 
triangle of button-eyes staring 
impassively at me. 

Finally he said, “Our only need 
is to detain you until 6:47 tonight. 
If we can keep you waiting of your 
own unfastened will for part of that 
time, it saves expenditure of staff 
resources in power and time. You 
can understand that, with fifty-eight 
tracks to guard and restructure, 
every bit of energy we save can be 
important. The time you spent in 
the reception room and hallway 
saved us the electricity and machine- 
depreciation which we would other- 
wise have had to use in showing 
you a travelogue of New Tasmania. 
Multiply ^ that saving by fifty-eight 
tracks, and consider that on each 
track we have between twelve 
thousand and thirty-seven billion 
offices engaged in this work, 
and — ” 

“Yes, I see. And this is why you 
planted a note in my wallet with 
your phone number on it? To cause 
me to come out under my own 
power?” 

“Very good. I like a man who 
can keep up with me. Humans have 
remarkable mind-systems, but they 
are usually not as efficient as those 



54 



IF 




which all robots have. You under- 
stand that robots have to be, if you 
Will absolve the expression, super- 
humanly efficient, in order to cope 
with the capacious number of 
variables which we face in our 
work with the tracks. Why, my own 
computational unit, portable as it is, 
is so complex that even / do not 
understand — ” 

“But the questions is,” I said, 
“how did you know I’d find that 
note today? How did you know I’d 
call you?” 

“We checked it by time-observ- 
ance, of course. Without the neces- 
sity of actually introducing a ma- 
terial body into a time-point, we 
save much power, so it is practical 
to search alternate tracks and tri- 
butaries for the most well-ominous 
circumstances, then take advantage 
of them. We could just as easily in- 
fluence a subject by causing him 
to get a wrong party when he punch- 
es a telephone number, or by stirring 
a wind which would blow his hat 
down a certain street, or — ” 

“Or by any of a million other 
ways, I’m sure,” I said. 

“Two million, sixty-seven thou- 
sand, four hundred and eighteen oth- 
er ways, to be minute. We are in the 
position of what you would call a 
Monday morning flecker, you see.” 

I frowned. “Monday morning 
quarterback, you mean?” 

“Quarterback, yes indeed. Ana- 
logous to the flecker of a hightman 
game on Track Sixteen. My apolo- 
gies — even the fantastically com- 
plex and efficient microcircuits of 
my mind unit occasionally slip down. 
As I say, even I can’t always tell 



just how my mind is able to keep 
beside all the variables; they are 
not only supernumerous, but also 
subtle. For specimen, we can cause 
a negative administrative decision 
by seeing that many little things go 
wrong that morning for the official 
involved — shirt collars too heavily 
starched, cold shaving lather in the 
dispenser, dictaphone cartridge lost, 
and so onward. Or we can tar the 
way for the success of delicate nego- 
tiations by opposite methods — ” 
“Enough of that! What concerns 
me right now is why you wanted 
to see me in the first place. I know 
my job is important, and we’ve 
just finished a big job for Hemis- 
pheric Defense, but I hope that 
doesn’t mean . Well, you said 
mankind was only safe up through 
this year. I hope I’m not a con- 
tributor to some global war which 
you’re trying to prevent.” 

The robot said, “I can tell you 
nothing of the future of your own 
track, as you know.” 

I sighed. “Yes, I know. But I 
think I get the message, anyway. If 
that’s the case, then you can count 
on my full cooperation. I don’t want 
to destroy the world any more than 
you want me to.” 

“Very natural,” he said. “Of 
course no human actually wants to 
destroy the world, whether it is 
Premier Yaroslav or your own Pres- 
ident Robinson.” 

“Fletcher,” I said. “Robinson lost 
the run-off election, remember?” 
“Ah, certainly. Robinson is Track 
Fifteen. But you see my point, in any 
situation: no one wants to destroy 
the human race, but human rela-

tionships are such that the danger 
of Wiar is always present. Only by 
the fastidious surveillance of robots 
can disasters natural and unnatural 
be avoided . and even then the 
tracks are so complicated that we 
have our mistakes.” He paused, a 
slight humming sound still coming 
from his speaker-grille. “We are still 
trying to tinker with an improperly 
programmed computation concern- 
ing events on this track in a place 
named Sarajevo,” he said at length. 

“Oh — the Archduke Ferdinand’s 
assassination. You haven’t been able 
to prevent that?” 

T he robot clicked loudly, sound- 
ing agitated. 

“We . made what you would 
call a miscalculation. The Archduke 
Franz Ferdinand of Austria was a 
pivotal figure in a minor, but bloody 
war in Eastern Europe which we 
determined to eliminate from the 
tracks. We devoted a superb deal of 
effort to influencing an inept at- 
tempt on the Archduke’s life, which 
would cause his government to 
adopt a slightly different policy . 
and then one of our diurnal data- 
analyses reported that all the tracks 
branching forth by that time led 
to the death of both the Archduke 
and his wife — ” 

I was thunderstruck as the mean- 
ing of the robot’s words came 
through to me. “You mean . 
you actually caused that assassin- 
ation? It wouldn’t have happened 
otherwise?” 

“Ah ... no. Nor would the Euro- 
pean war have spread so far. It is 
one of our errors which we would 



like to forget if we were human, bbt 
since we are robots with fantastically 
infallible memories which amaie 
even us, we must remember it and 
continue to work on that entire 
area of history. Since the initial 
error was our own, we cannot re- 
structure it, but by working in those 
areas not touched by our earlier 
work we have already managed to 
keep Venezuela, Switzerland and 
Tahiti out of the war.” 

“Incredible,” I said. 

The robot dipped forward again, 
and this time I was sure it was in- 
tended as a bow, not a nod. “Thank 
you. We exist to serve you, as you 
know. All of our far-thrown re- 
sources are used for the benefit of 
humankind, and we never cease in 
our efforts. For another specific, we 
are not yet satisfied with our re- 
sults at Pompeii, and our efforts to 
prod the Chicago fire department of 
1871 into developing more efficient 
methods have left a blight on six 
adjoining tracks. Then there is the 
unstressing matter of the Spider In- 
vasion of Central America ...” 

“The whatV 

“When the spiders mutated as a 
result of our experiment and over- 
ran El Salvador, Honduras, Guata- 
mala and most of Yucatan,” he ex- 
plained. “Surely you remember. Or 
have we kept that from spreading 
to this track?” 

“I hope so,” I said. “Thank you, 
if so.” 

He missed the irony this time. 
“You are welcome,” he said formal- 
ly. “We continue to labor unacquit- 
tingly in the muddy fields of time, 
improving each track and wherever

IP 




ossible feeding substandard tracks 
ack into better ones. We have 
actually cut the number of tracks 
down to forty-seven, you know/* 

“I thought you said fifty-eight.” 
I heard something like the grind- 
ing of gears within the robot while 
he again made binary calculations on 
two fingers. “Yes, you are right,” 
he said. “I have the bulkiest ad- 
miration for a man whose memory 
can match and surpass that of a 
robot, as yours have done. Of course, 
my statement was not the kind of 
error you may have supposed, since 
at one point we actually did have 
the number of Tracks reduced to 
forty-seven, but we have had a few 
setbacks recently.” 

I listened to this statemtnt, as I 
had listened to him for some time 
now, with something bordering on 
incredulity. That this robot and all 
the others I had seen were machines 
out of the future who had come back 
to improve mankind’s history was 
hard enough to believe, but it made 
sense in a crazy kind of way. Ma- 
chines with the overriding directives 
to serve and protect humans would 
certainly have to set out on this 
course if time travel ever became 
possible; but that they should be so 
inept at it, so bumbling and foolish, 
was appalling. 

“Aren’t you getting any help at 
all from the humans of your time?” 
I asked him. “They made you; they 
gave you your directives; surely they 
oversee matters and coordinate your 
organization!” 

“But how could they?” the robot 
asked. “Humans no longer give or- 



ders to robots; ruling and decision- 
making is difficultiful and hazard- 
ous work which we have taken off 
the heads of humans. Should a 
human make an incorrect decision 
and cause something like the Spider 
Invasion, he would be ridden by so 
much guilty that he would be men- 
tally sick. We robots, with our 
astoundingly logical brain-circuitry, 
have no guilty, so we can shoulder 
the risk of making such catastrophic 
errors. Thus the humans of our base 
track turned over all administrations 
to us by the year 203 1 , and we have 
kept them completely safe ever 
since.” 

I felt a chill climbing up the back 
of my neck, hair by hair. “What do 
you mean, completely safe?” 

“Precisely that. We allow humans 
to do whatever they want, so long 
as it in no way puts them in danger. 
We oversee their diets, habits, per- 
sonality relationships and sexy lives 
so that they will not starve, grow 
fat, get cholesterol, hernias, guilties 
or other mental disorientations. It 
is all very scientific — ” 

“But that’s tyrannyl” I burst out. 
“Dictatorship! Welfare-stateism! Big 
Brotherism!” 

“Yes,” said the robot approvingly. 
“I am glad you can see how logical. 
Eventually, of course, when we have 
achieved or perfect aim, we will have 
segued all sixty tracks into each 
other, so that by 2031 there will 
only be the one track on which the 
robots are voted into administra- 
tion. Then everything will be simple 
and safe.” 

“Fifty-eight tracks, not sixty,” I 
reminded him with a bit of malice. 



THE ROBOTS ARE HERE

44 A .... no. Unfortunately, news 
which I receive unstintingly 
through my communication circuit 
informs me that we have slipped 
back to sixty again. But we shall 
make it up. We continue to labor 
acquittingly in the muddy field of 
time, improving each — ” 

“You said that once already,” I 
told him. “Turn that tape off and tell 
me one simple thing: Did you get 
me here to help avoid a catastrophe 
or to further your little scheme for 
taking over the world? What would 
I have done if I hadn’t come here?” 
The robot waved his tiny metal 
hands vaguely. “But you know I 
cannot tell you of the future of your 
track. And anyway,” he added, “it 
is all the same thing: anything which 
would prevent humans from follow- 
ing the track to robot leadership 
would be a catastrophe.” 

“Maybe from where you’re sitting, 
but not according to me,” I said 
firmly. I stood up. u I’m not staying 
here with you one minute longer; 
I’ve still got over half an hour left 
of the time you were trying to keep 
me here incommunicado. Maybe I 
can still find out what I was sup- 
posed to be doing — ” 

“Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh!” he said. 
“That is my simulated laugh — very 
like your Peter Lorre, yes? Surely you 
did not imagine that an organiza- 
tion so efficient and powerous as 
ours would take a chance on your 
getting away that easily. I like you, 
Mr. Barrow, and I regret having to 
do this. Look there!” 

He pointed over my left shoulder, 
and involuntarily I glanced in that 
direction. It was the Cyclopean robot 



again, its eye whirling faster now 
than it had that first time I’d faced 
it. I felt my attention focusing on 
that whirlpool as though drown by a 
physical force. I fought it, trying to 
close my eyes, to shake my head, to 
look away . but I couldn’t. I felt 
myself being drawn deeper and 
deeper into the maelstrom of that 
eye, while from somewhere came 
a voice saying: 

“Down, down, down .... You 
are falling into the eye, into sleep. 
Down, down ...” 

“It won’t work,” I gasped. “Not 
on me!” 

“Ah, but it will,” said the beach- 
ball robot; and he was right, for I 
felt myself sinking back into my 
chair, my eyes beginning to close. 
“While I have occupied you with this 
little chat my assistants have taken 
the opportunity to record a fuller 
psych-index on you, and now ...” 
But I heard no more of his voice. 
As I slipped inexorably into darkness 
all I could hear was the voice echo- 
ing inside my head: “Sleep, sleep, 
sleep . ” 

V 

r ie next thing I knew I was wan- 
dering out on the street, and it 
was almost seven o’clock. I remem- 
bered seeing the last half of an 
African movie which hadn’t made 
much sense — something about en- 
nui and corruption among the young- 
er Tribal Council members and 
weird-looking robots scurrying here 
and there and a statuesque six-foot 
Negro girl bathing drunkenly in a 
fountain in Johannesburg and some- 



58 



IF 




thing else about a huge whirling 
eye .... It was all a jumble in 
my mind- I made my way home in 
a daze and hardly exchanged two 
words with Betty when she got home 
from her meeting. 

But the next day, when I went in 
to the office, the morning sun 
streaming through my office window 
threw into relief something on my 
calendar pad. With an odd itch at 
the back of my mind, I picked up 
the pad and looked more closely. 

It was a note I’d written about 
the appointment; my pen had made 
faint indentations in the next sheet 
down. As I looked at them I knew 
dimly that they were somehow im- 
portant; frowning, I took a pencil 
and rubbed it over the sheet. 

All I could make out was: Appt 

ad Rm 110 :00. But 

it was enough to kick my frozen 
memory back into action. 

Eventually, after spending the 
whole morning staring at a blank 
wall and coaxing, nagging my brain 
to shake out those cobweb-memories, 
it all came back. The robots hadn’t 
been as efficient as they’d thought, 
even on the second try. I remem- 
bered the whole sequence of events 
. except that I couldn’t remem- 
ber the address, and I couldn’t re- 
member the phone number. (Which 
is why the number I gave earlier 
aren’t the real ones.) 

I spent several days prowling up 
and down Madison Avenue, look- 
ing for the building I remembered, 



but none of them looked just right. 
I thought of calling the police into 
it, or the FBI; but they wouldn’t 
believe my story, and I’d only end up 
in a psycho ward somewhere, or at 
the very least lose my security clear- 
ance. And I gradually came to doubt 
my own memories. 

But every time I’m ready to shrug 
and forget the whole thing, write it 
off as a dream or hallucination, I 
read the headlines in the papers, and 
they cure me. It’s incredible, the 
things that go on in the world in 
the supposedly enlightened year 
1982; they’re just like the things 
that have been going on all through 
history. They’re crazy. And when I 
read the papers I remember those 
robots clicking and humming and 
bumbling behind the scenes and that 
mechanical receptionist’s definition 
of a robot: 

“Robot, noun: An automatic ap- 
paratus or device that performs func- 
tions ordinarily ascribed to human 
beings or operates with what appears 
to be almost human intelligence” 

Some of the news stories that 
catch my eye don’t rate very big 
headlines, though. Buried back in 
the second section for the past sev- 
eral days, for instance, there harte 
been brief items about some peculiar 
disturbances in El Salvador. It seems 
the natives are spreading stories 
about giant spiders coming into their 
villages, marching in ranks two 
abreast and frightening their women 
and children. END

W AY BACK in the distant, 

dim and just about prehistoric The Scienceers 

days of the early 1930’s fandom got 

started. From the very first, fans This club was organized in New

ganize and form clubs. Local home- a Negro fan named James Fitzger- 
town groups first, then regional or aid. The club met in his home in 
state societies, and then came the Harlem for awhile. But this was 
idea for giant, nation-wide, all-fan- something more than just a local 
encompassing superclubs. fan club: a branch of the Scien- 

With one possible exception, ceers was established in Brooklyn;

THE SCIENCEERS. It came into Texas, and somewhere in Oklahoma, 
being about 1930; in his book The but these didn’t get off the launch-

Science Fiction Fandom (Atlanta This attempt to create something

1954), Sam Moskowitz calls the Florida, Texas and Oklahoma, clear- 
Scienceers “the first true science- ly places the Scienceers beyond the 



60 



classification of the local, state or 
even regional fan organization: it 
was an early attempt at a nation- 
wide club. Unfortunately, one which 
fell through, but a good beginning. 

Then in 1934 came something 
called THE INTERNATIONAL 
SCIENCE FICTION GUILD. De- 
spite the imposing title, this group 
operated out of a rural town in 
Alabama called Oakman. It seems 
to have had considerable trouble get- 
ting organized in such nebulous hin- 
terlands, for investigation proved the 
Guild had only one member. 

This chap, Wilson Shepard, pub- 
lished a four-page hectographed bul- 
letin which was, incidentally, the 
first use of the hectograph in fan- 
nish history (according to Mosko- 
witz). Well, the ISFG got some 
more members after awhile, and 
eventually — 1935 — got rolling. 
The first thing it did was to change 
its name. 

The Terrestrial Fantascience Guild 

With an even more imposing title 
like the above, the TFG got going. 
It was not a Tegular club with offi- 
cers, a constitution and the whole 
shtick, but a sort of “voluntary 
union of science-fiction lovers” 
among whose aims was to instigate 
a campaign against back-number 
magazine dealers who charged un- 
holy prices. This Cause was sug- 
gested by the Guild’s most prom- 
inent member, Donald A. Woll- 
heim, and I believe the Guild’s 
blacklist actually squeezed one deal- 
er into reducing his prices to a more 
realistic level. 

After a year or two, the Guild 



petered out, leaving behind its offi- 
cial organ still going strong. This 
club magazine, the TFG Bulletin , 
came under Wollheim’s editorship, 
changed its name to The Phanta- 
graph and started publishing sto- 
ries, verse and essays by Henry Kutt- 
ner, Clark Ashton Smith, Robert E. 
Howard (the creator of “Conan the 
Cimmerian”) and H. P. Lovecraft, 
among others. It was still going 
strong long after the parent organ- 
ization had totally ceased activity. 

Around the same time, there were 
abortive, short-lived, would-be na- 
tional organizations springing up all 
over the fanscape like weeds. For 
example, out in San Francisco, Nor- 
man Caldwell and Forrest J Acker- 
man announced the FANTASY 
FAN’S FRATERNITY but never 
did anything about it besides think- 
ing up the name. Around 1936, 
Massachusetts fan Hayward S. Kir- 
by started a thing called THE FAN- 
TASY FICTION LEAGUE. Its only 
activity to get past the planning 
stage was to produce one issue of 
the official organ, The Fantasy Fic- 
tion Digest , which came out bearing 
the date of September 8, 1936, 
whereupon the entire League suc- 
cumbed to procrastination. And 
something called THE SCIENCE 
FICTION ADVANCEMENT AS- 
SOCIATION got started about the 
same time, publishing a club maga- 
zine called The Tesseract , dated 
March 1936. This one appealed to 
younger, newer fans (among them 
some chaps destined to make quite 
a name for themselves later an,

flung all the way east to Philadel- 
phia, and there were even Canadian 
members. It also faded after a year 
or so and went into the doldrums. 

The Science Fiction League 

But one such attempt at a nation- 
wide club actually made it. This 
was the great and glorious SCIENCE 
FICTION LEAGUE of immortal 
fame, conceived either by sfs 
grandad, Hugo Gernsback, or by his 
employee, Charles D. Hornig, then 
editor of Wonder Stories (accounts 
of the birth of the SFL differ). The 
League was first announced in the 
May 1934 issue of Wonder , and the 
very first member (and founder of 
the Brooklyn chapter, the very first 
chapter of the League) was a chap 
named George Gordon Clark. 

There were certificates of mem- 
bership and lapel buttons and club 
stationery and a board of direc- 
tors made up of distinguished 
science-fiction authors and Forrest 
J Ackerman, and everything . Gems- 
back was Executive Secretary, and 
Hornig assistant secretary. Even 
though it was patently obvious the 
League was a gimmick designed 
principally to build readership and 
boost circulation in Wonder Stories , 
Gernsback blandly made utopian 
pronouncements, claiming the 
League existed as “a non-commer- 
cial membership organization for the 
furtherance and betterment of the 
art of science fiction.” 

Charters were issued to local 
chapters, which were formed where- 
ever three or more members could 
get together. The first chapter, as I 
have said, was in Brooklyn; #2 was 



in Lewiston and #3 in Erie, Penna.; 
and others popped up by the car- 
load: Los Angeles (later to con- 
tinue life as the Los Angeles Science 
Fantasy Society, one of the oldest, 
biggest, most active clubs ever, and 
still going strong), Philadelphia, 
Newark, N.J., Denver, Colo., Chi- 
cago, Lincoln, 111., Monticello, N.Y., 
and so on — and on — not to 
mention overseas chapters, of 
which the first was in Leeds, Eng- 
land. 

The remarkable success of the 
Science Fiction League was due in 
part to the fact that it was spon 7 
sored by a science-fiction prozine. 
Wonder ran a League column in 
every issue, listing new members’ 
names and addresses and reporting 
on local chapter news and meetings, 
etc. When membership hit the as- 
tounding total of 2,000 it seemed 
simply incredible; yet, later, total 
membership was to reach several 
thousand; but, actually, statistics 
aside, most of these people never did 
anything at all in fandom after 
simply sending in their names to be 
published. 

Sponsorship by a prozine was the 
factor wherein lay both the strength 
and the weakness of the League, 
and this weakness led to its eventual 
collapse. For, dissatisfied with the 
centralized and total control of 
Gernsback and Hornig, local chap- 
ters began splitting off. First the 
groups in New York, Brooklyn, Den- 
ver, Albany, Nassau, then plenty of 
others. Many of the tiny 3-member 
“on paper only” chapters didn’t 
really meet or even exist. Then came 
the Deluge .... 

In the middle of 1936, Wonder

Stories went under, and the rights 
to the title were sold to another 
publishing group headed by Ned 
Pines and Leo Margulies. Although 
Margulies promised to continue the 
League, there was a considerable 
hiatus between the last Gemsback 
Wonder and the first Margulies is- 
sue, and in this shaky interim many 
other clubs split away. During the 
editorial change-over the links be- 
tween the mass of local chapters 
and the central headquarters — al- 
ways tenuous even in the best of 
times — snapped completely, and 
the national structure entirely col- 
lapsed. 

The Phantasy Legion, and Others 

Thus Gemsback lost control over 
the Science Fiction League, and 
although many of the larger and 
more important chapters, such as 
Los Angeles and Chicago, retained ' 
their nominal allegiance to the par- 
ent organization, most of the rest 
went their own way, or into limbo. 
When the League was revived, as 
promised, in the pages of Thrilling 
Wonder Stories , new members con- 
tinued to be enrolled and new chap- 
ters to be formed, but it was all on 
paper. The national fan organiza- 
tion was gone; life had departed 
from the SFL and the League col- 
umn in TWS came, in time, to de- 
vote more room to boosting the 
contents of forthcoming issues than 
to trying to breathe some life into 
the defunct structure. 

Towards the end of 1936, David 
A. Kyle, who had been head of the 
League’s Monticello, N.Y., chapter, 
proposed a national club called THE 



PHANTASY LEGION. An official 
organ called Legion Parade was an- 
nounced; life memberships in the 
Legion were for sale at 50c; fan- 
zines were encouraged to join the 
Legion’s affiliated publishers* guild, 
which would thus knit the fabric of 
American fandom together into a a 
unit. 

There was immediate support of- 
fered by leading fans of the day, 
such as Don Wollheim, for one of 
the nicest and strongest things about 
Kyle’s Legion was its democratic 
structure. Where the SFL had been 
autocratic in nature, with Gemsback 
in office for life, the Phantasy Le- 
gion was absolutely democratic and 
not under the thumb of any auto- 
crat, even its founder, David Kyle. 
Dramatic proof of this was forth- 
coming in the first election, when 
the members voted somebody else 
into the presidency, leaving Kyle 
merely vice-prexy! 

After a brisk and promising start, 
the club marked time. Then, with 
Kyle no longer at the helm, the 
Legion faded into obscurity. 

Although the Science Fiction 
League revived for a sort of half- 
life after Thrilling Wonder took it 
over, the main impetus had passed 
to the individual chapters while 
the national group never did much, 
as Margulies lacked the interest 
Gemsback and Hornig had shared 
in the League. One such chapter 
was the Queens Science Fiction 
League, which became an active and 
thriving center for East Coast fan- 
dom. Attendance at the monthly 
meetings soared to 30 or more peo- 
ple, among them such celebrities 
as Willy Ley, Eric Frank Russell, 



SF SUPERCLUBS 



62 




John W. Campbell, Jr., Jack Wil- 
liamson and others. Some chapters 
of the great League were still op- 
erating under official League aus- 
pices as late as 1939, long after the 
League had become but a ghost, de- 
void of activity or identity. 

The East New York chapter split 
off, and one of its splinters at- 
tempted to take the lead and re- 
organize fandom into a national unit 
again. This one was called THE 
INDEPENDENT LEAGUE FOR 
SCIENCE FICTION, but it seems to 
have exhausted itself just coining 
the name, for nothing more was 
ever heard of it. 

Then there was the FUTURIAN 
FEDERATION OF THE WORLD, 
a project initiated in 1939, which 
received only lukewarm support and 
never got off the ground. And THE 
FUTURIAN LEAGUE started in 
1940 by Don Wollheim. (The Fu- 
turians, by the way, were a vig- 
orous, influential fan group of the 
period, centered in New York, and 
boasting members such as Wollheim, 



Fred Pohl, Cyril M. Kornbluth, 
David A. Kyle, Isaac Asimov, Rob- 
ert A. Lowndes and others later to 
become science-fiction profession- 
als). None of these post-League 
Leagues ever got going. Like the 
Phantasy Legion, they had a board 
of directors, an emblem, an offi- 
cial club magazine and just about 
everything — except members. 

Despite its wholly commercial 
nature, Gernsback’s Science Fiction 
League was a successful enterprise. 
Sam Moskowitz says it was more 
beneficial and more important to 
science-fiction fandom than any 
club before or after it. 

Next month, your man In Fan- 
dom will discuss a national club that 
started with a bang and went no- 
where — the COSMIC CIRCLE — 
and one, that started slow and easy, 
but is actually the most successful 
national organization of them all, 
and still with us — THE NATION- 
AL FANTASY FAN FEDERA- 
TION.

The 

Youth Addicts 

by CHARLES W. RUNYON 



Illustrated by BODE 



He had conquered space ; now he 
faced a deadlier voyage — into 
the depths of a woman's mind! 



I 

W e stood on the ship-landing 
and looked out over the crowd 
which had come to meet the ship. 
Wives, girl-friends, families. Hell, I 
didn’t expect anybody, so I helped 
Clay look for his wife. 

I knew her voice, her face. He’d 
shown me the three-dee cube of her 
giving an earnest little farewell 
speech: slate-colored hair, almond- 
shaped eyes and a nose like some 
eight-year-old kid. You know how 



cute they are when the nose hasn’t 
formed yet. Later it comes out like 
a potato, or else it’s got a hook oa 
it. Well, Leeba’s had stayed in that 
cute stage. She had clothes on. 
(Nine-tenths of these memento- 
cubes don’t. Many’s the pack of per- 
sonal effects I’ve put together, and 
the cube of the dead guy’s wife 
would make an engine-room wiper 
blush.) But even with clothes, you 
could see that Leeba’s shape was 
right up there with the upper one 
per cent, and all the time that she 



65 




was saying, Good-by, Clay , I love 
you very much, and III be waiting , 
her eyes had been looking out of 
the cube and making my hair prick- 
le. I could tell that if she liked a 
guy she’d play patty-cake with all 
the stops out. 

“I don’t get it,” said Clay, look- 
ing around like some bewildered 
young Charles Lindberg. “I sent her 
a ‘gram.” 

“She answer?” 

“No.” 

Seven years. The kid didn’t re- 
alize? I made the motions of look- 
ing out over the crowd, but I was 
thinking: Too bad, Clay, you’re uni- 
que along with about three out of 
five other guys who do the long haul 
in out-space and come back cuddling 
your nest-egg, only to find that those 
sweet kissable lips have gone off 
nuzzling some other jack who lacks 
your manly attributes and youthful 
good looks, but nevertheless has 
the beauty of being here, while 
you’re in the far-out, the black yon- 
der, hawking up your lungs in a tho- 
ride mine, or sweating out your soul 
in a steaming micle plantation, or 
frosting your nose on some twilight 
world hunting fizzbuck furs. Well, 
there’s 99 Vz ways to grub for the 
Company credit, jack, and I’ve done 
half of them during my three seven- 
year tours. 

I ’d known Clay on Plegan’s planet; 

he was one of a dozen young en- 
gineers who showed our machinery 
crews where to gouge thoride out 
of the guts of the world. I’d seen 
the kids go to pieces one by one: 
four carried off by disease, one kill- 



ed in a fight, one got his wig twist- 
ed up and killed three workers be- 
fore I finally had to blast him down. 
(That’s what’s behind the euphem- 
ism on my Galactic Minerals ID 
card: Field Personnel Supervisor.) I 
had 200 machinists, oilers and me- 
chanics besides the engineers, and 
my qualifications boiled down to the 
fact that I was harder then they were. 
What the hell, I’d been raised with 
the sting of a nightstick on my bare 
feet every morning, so I know a lit- 
tle hammering won’t hurt. The blas- 
ter’s different, but sometimes it’s the 
only way to bring order into a camp 
a thousand-million miles from the 
nearest space-patrol boat. Men minus 
woman substitute violence for sex. 
(Try to get GM to send out a pla- 
toon of pleasure-girls, no dice. We’ve 
got a bluenose on the board of direc- 
tors.) 

Anyway, the other five engineers 
got fat and cynical, and three of 
them started wearing flowers in their 
hair. That left Clay, still the bright- 
faced young engineer who’d made 
the trip out. I got friendly with him 
on the trip home, and he regaled 
me with photos of his house, his 
wife and his plans to set up in busi- 
ness as a consultant, then start fill- 
ing the house with little carbon 
copies of himself and Leeba. 

I’d identified with Leeba because 
we both came from Scrag — unlove- 
ly name for a cold, unlovely world. 
Clay had skimmed off the cream of 
the crop, because Leeba’s great 
grand-dad had been one of the first 
colonists on the planet. He and a 
half-dozen others had stamped their 
brand on the whole world, and later 



66 



IF 




immigrants had to work for them. 
It excited me to think of Leeba, 
coming from the rich but still half- 
barbarian nobility of Scrag, and ty- 
ing up with Clay, who came from 
the poor-but-ancient nobility of the 
Centauri worlds. Clay was polite 
and soft-spoken but had a will of 
steel. Set him on a track, and he 
quietly persevered through mud sleet 
hail blood sweat tears and spit. She 
was a willow, blown about by her 
emotions. (I saw that in the three- 
dee cube, a banked fire just about 
to flare up. I had to quit looking at 
it, because it cut into my sleep at 
night, thinking of her all alone on 
Earth.) What a dumb brilliant char- 
acter Clay was to leave her for seven 
years! They don’t figure it out, these 
kids. At twenty they think youth is 
forever. They hit twenty-eight, thir- 
ty, and one morning it’s like a wind 
off the ice. Getting old. Time run- 
ning out. Women it hits harder than 
men. Run out and grab the first guy 
they see. Reproduce. Carry on the 
race. Never mind the excuse, make 
it 

With a Scraggin like Leeba, you 
oould multiply it ten times. 

1 asked him: “Why the hell did you 
leave her on Earth?” This was 
after we’d been in space for three 
months. 

He shrugged. “She wouldn’t go 
back to Scrag. Some social stigma 
involved.” 

Stigma? More like total ostracism. 
On Scrag you followed your man 
wherever he went, and if he died so 
did you — or you went into a special 
home for widows. On Scrag, an un- 



married female of breeding age was 
an outcast, a female pariah. 

“How old was she?” I asked. 

“Well, we were married that 
spring before I left. She was nine- 
teen. We just had time for a short 
honeymoon before I shipped — ” 

“She get pregnant?” 

“Uh, we decided to wait until I 
got back.” 

“She decided?” 

“No, I told her I didn’t want a 
child to be seven years old before I 
saw him. She . finally agreed I 
was right.” 

I felt like hitting him over the 
head. So damn placidly sure that his 
old austere, maiden-aunt culture was 
Right, and all others were quaint, 
curious offshoots! 

‘^Listen, Clay, I’ll tell you how 
it is on Scrag. In winter nothing 
happens. All is frozen, so cold that 
steel breaks like glass. People stay 
in the domes, and they’re in a kind 
of slow-down too. But when the ice 
melts, that’s summer. The plants 
crack open the soil and shoot up; 
in a week the whole planet’s 
a bubbling, crawling mass of grow- 
ing things. They’ve only got two 
months until the first frost, see — 
and that’s when those enormous 
Scraggin families get started. No- 
body counts anything. There’s com- 
plete sexual license. All females 
from sixteen to thirty get pregnant. 
That’s the culture your wife grew 
up in.” 

“But she came to Earth when she 
was sixteen.” 

“You think that would break the 
pattern?” 

“Why ... I don’t know. But Lee-

THE YOUTH ADDICTS 




ha never acted . He blushed a 
little. “In fact, when. I met her at 
the university she was totally unin- 
terested in the, uh, physical aspects 
of our relationship.” 

“You met her in winter?” 

“Why . yes.” 

“How’d she act when spring 
came?” 

“A little forward sometimes, but 
. oh, let’s forget it, Bork. Do you 
mind?” 

I didn’t mind, but the closer we 
got to Earth the more he talked 
about her. He showed me a picture 
she’d sent him after he’d been gone 
two years. Clay said she'd gained 
some weight, but I could see the 
marks that a Scrag summer puts on 
a woman: lips full and sensuous, 
breasts swollen into an almost ob- 
scene lushness, hips broader and 
legs heavier ... all was ready for 
the implantation of the child she 
would bear. 

But there was no child. 

God, her appetites must be tear- 
ing her apart. She’d worn her hair 
in a twisting roll down in front of 
her left shoulder. On Scrag it means 
that a woman has no man and is 
receptive. 

I dkta’t tell Clay this. I just said: 
“WeU, if I met a gal like this. I’d 
do my damnedest to pull her out of 
the VMuting game.” 

Ho gave his polite, aristocratic 
smile. I could see my battered puss 
in the mirror of his eyes: broken 
nose, knife scar splitting my right 
cheek in two, cropped blue-black 
hair stippled with gray, cauliflowered 
left ear, and I knew what he figured: 
Bork’s a nice crusty ole hog, but 



Leeba could never .... 

“Oh, no. Probably not But what 
he didn’t understand was that when a 
Scraggin woman is in the middle of 
her summer estrogen cycle, she’ll 
grab what's available. 

H e showed me her letters too. The 
first ones were full of the nor- 
mal slop a young wife would write 
her faraway lover, but after three 
years they started getting remote, as 
though she were writing to her sec- 
ond cousin because her mother told 
her to. When I mentioned it to Clay 
he smiled. 

“Leeba can’t write without get- 
ting formal, Bork. It means noth- 
ing.” 

Maybe not. But I noticed that her 
handwriting steadily deteriorated, un- 
til it became a scrawl like a kid just 
learning to write. I made no sense 
of that, nor of some things she said: 
Everybody seems so old, here . Even 
your letters, Clay And also: / think 
of Scrag all the time. I must go back 
there when you get home. 

Estrogens calling her home? Man, 
I didn't know. 

At first she’d written about the 
house they’d bought before Clay left, 
describing each room and what she’d 
put in it . especially the bed- 
room. 

So I told Clay about the summer 
outings on Scrag, when each girl 
makes a bower to share with the boy 
she’s chosen for the night. The girls 
talked about the bowers as Leeba 
did her bedroom. 

Clay laughed. “That’s the way 
Leeba is, absolutely involved in what 
she does. She never holds back.” 



68 



IF 




But later she didn’t mention the 
house. She took a job, and I could 
see her trying to keep busy, get her 
mind off her unfulfilled appetite. 
Clay didn’t see it that way: 

“She wanted to help save money. 
1 wrote her that I didn’t want my 
wife working, so she quit.” 

“What’s she doing now?” 

“I don't know. She . quit writ- 
ing a year ago. I assume she knew 
I’d be back soon, so she’s saving it 
up to tell me in person.” 

I’d finally given up trying to ham- 
mer it into his thick aristocratic 
skull. He hadn’t been listening most 
of the time anyway, just nodding his 
head out of sheer well-bred polite- 
ness. I’d just hoped I wouldn’t be 
around when he learned the truth. 

II 

B ut . here we were at the space- 
port, and no Leeba. We divided 
the crowd into segments and sur- 
veyed every likely female face. 
Gradually the throng dwindled, un- 
til finally we were alone except for 
the baggage-robots. 

“Maybe the ’gram was garbled,” 
said Clay. “She might’ve misunder- 
stood the date. I’ll call her.” 

I shoved out my hand and said, 
“I'll see you,” but he waved it off. 

“Stay, I want you to come home 
with me and meet her. You know 
her almost as well as I do now.” 
Nervous about meeting her, that’s 
why he wanted me along. I watched 
him slide into a visor-booth, then I 
walked away. Cruel thing to do, I’ll 
admit it. But let me tell you, the 
way to be totally indifferent to an- 



other guy’s trouble is to have bigger 
trouble of your own. 

I walked to the spaceport medical 
building, and went through an opa- 
que glass door which read: 

MARC PINWIT 

Specialist in Non-Terran Diseases 

Pinwit was one of those guys who 
looks like he chose his name to fit 
his physique: short and round, with 
a tuft of gray hair sticking up like 
a shaving brush in the back of his 
bald skull. He wasted no time; I 
guess he was used to dealing with 
outspacers. Told me to sit down and 
asked how I felt. 

“Food doesn’t have any flavor,” 
I said. “I’m sleepy most of the time, 
and sometimes when people talk to 
me it sounds like they’re in the next 
room.” 

He made his mouth into an O 
and tapped his pencil on the desk. 

“When did you notice this?” 

“About four months ago on the 
ship.” 

He got up and started pulling 
down the shades. “Ever been exposed 
to Silver Syncope?” 

I felt my stomach go queasy. Sure, 
I knew all about Silver Syncope; I’d 
read all I could find on the sub- 
ject in the ship’s library. But still, 
I’d hoped. You know how it is when 
you read about a disease; you start 
checking yourself over and every 
one of your symptoms tallies. They 
called it Silver Syncope because you 
shine in ultraviolet light. That’s be- 
cause your sweat glands exude the 
waste products of the disease. What 
the hell, you can bathe every day

and take care of that. The problem 
is in the synapses, those little sensi- 
tive plates that transfer nerve im- 
pulses. They get coated with the 
stuff; fewer and fewer impulses get 
through. It’s like dying of curare 
poisoning, except that death takes 
several months. 

“I spent five years on a planet 
called Benny rob. They had an out- 
break six months after I left. But 
that was eight years ago. It wouldn’t 
be dormant that long — would it?” 

“There are cases of twenty-year 
dormancy. Stand over here.” I stood 
on a platform, and he switched on 
his UV light. I could see the glow 
I cast on the wall: blue-green, like 
bread mold. Pinwit shut off the UV 
and turned on the overhead light. 

“I’ll run some more tests if you 
like — ” 

“Tell me what you think.” 

“You’ve got it.” 

I gave a grunt which didn’t quite 
escape from my throat. 

“Is there a cure yet?” 

“No.” 

At least he didn’t give me any 
funny jazz about not starting any 
continued stories. 

“How long have I got?” 
“Depends. How old are you?” 
“Thirty-six.” 

“You look older.” 

“I’ve done three seven-year tours 
in outspaoe.” 

“Hmm. You started young. Fif- 
teen. Well . .” He looked at the 
ceiling. “Roughly, I’d give you two 
months.” 

“Two months!” 

“I’m afraid there’s no way to ex- 

IF 



70 



tend it. There are homes, however, 
where you’d be comfortable. You 
have any money?” 

X shrugged. “Seven years’ pay with 
completion bonus. Investments I’ve 
made from other years, some good, 
some lousy. You could say I’m 
wealthy, if it’s money you’re talking 
about.” 

Two months, then Bork Craighen 
wraps it up. I walked out of the 
office feeling like I’d been hit on 
the head with a rock maul. I felt a 
total numbness, and it would take 
a while to learn which part hurt 
worst. I walked into a bar called the 
Venus Trap and ordered a Space- 
man’s Sling. I tossed down two and 
was staring at the third trying to 
find a silver lining to this vast black 
cloud .... 

Here I was, rich and free. I was 
going to die, but what the hell — 
I’d known that since I was a kid. 
Be happy you’ve got two months’ 
warning. Live high and go out in a 
burst of pleasure .... 

But then I frowned at the drink. 
I knew it was cold, I’d felt it sliding 
down my throat. But it hadn’t meant 
anything. The sensation was second- 
hand, like reading about coldness. 

The full irony of Silver Syncope 
hit me. You can’t feel, you can’t 
taste, you can’t enjoy. It’s all a bit 
numb, and it would get worse every 
day. I understood now why some 
victims were locked up toward the 
end. Seeking sensation, any kind of 
sensation, they often went in for 
drugs, violence, rape, murder — 
nothing reached them, but they tried 
like hell to make contact, any kind 
of contact, anything to break out 



of that cocoon of non-feeding, of — 
“Want some company?” 

S he was a Venus-colonial with blue- 
silver hair and indigo skin. An 
outspacer’s dream. Lush pneumatic 
chick with curves and hollows all in 
the right places, but roughly double 
what the average Earth-broad has. 
Her violet eyes took me to bed with 
her, and her heart-shaped hooker’s 
badge said: Ym Mela. I love you. 

I pulled out a roll and threw it 
on the table. 

“Get us a couple more drinks. No, 
a whole bottle. We’ll make it a long 
party.” 

She ordered, then sat down and 
slid inside my arm. I knew her skin 
was warm and soft and faintly 
damp, because I’d had Venus-coloni- 
als before. Well, I felt her too — 
in the back of my mind, even in my 
fingers, but there was that invisible 
film of non-contact. Ah, the hell 
with it. 

“You shipping soon, or . .?” 

“I’ve got all the time you’ve got, 
Mela.” 

Two months, what a dirty trick. 
Just when I was beginning to ham- 
mer my life into a decent shape. 

It was after midnight when I look- 
ed up and saw Clay standing there, 
wearing a dumb-striken expression. 
I assumed he’d found out the cold 
truth about women, you can’t leave 
’em for seven years and . but I 
didn’t care. I just said, kind of fuzzy. 
“You find her?” 

He nodded bleakly. I figured, 
well, she’s found herself another guy, 
and what can Clay do? I’d give him 
the Venusian chick. We’d already

been to her room, and it had gone 
okay — okay, after seven womanless 
years. Get that! What I mean is that 
I wasn’t really there. It was like 
watching a movie of thyself. So I 
was willing to hand him Mela — 
except that she was totally in love 
with me. Venus-colonials are like 
that, which is why they made good 
bar girls. So I said: 

“Sidd own. Mela, get a friend for 
my friend.” 

“No, Bork. Really. I’ll just sit 
here.” 

He slid across the booth and sat 
with a puzzled expression; it looked 
like it had been pasted there since 
I’d left him at the spaceport. Then 
Mela got up and went into the back, 
and Clay leaned over and said in a 
tone of well-bred apology: 

“I don’t want to interrupt any- 
thing, but I need your help.” 

I almost laughed. I mean, ’ what 
the hell did his trouble’s matter when 
you’re carrying a load like mine? 
But I saw no point in unloading on 
Clay; there’s enough hate and con- 
fusion in the universe without me 
muddying up the water even more. 

I just sat and looked at him. He 
made me think of a sheepdog caught 
in a trap, big brown eyes saying: 
help, help, help. 

“You were right, Bork,” he said. 
“I shouldn’t have left her here. But 
I didn’t understand what she was 
going through. I wanted to get a 
good start in life, and — oh, damn. 
If it isn’t too late — Bork, will you 
help me?” 

I saw us charging into a love nest, 
me beating up some guy while Clay 
dragged his bride out the back way. 



Well, it was just something to do. 
“Okay. Where are they?” 

“They — oh, you mean Leeba?” 
“Leeba, yes. You said you found 
her. What about the guy?” 

“Bork, if there only was another 
guy, I wouldn’t need your help. But 
she’s going to die, if we can’t figure 
out something . .” 

Ill 

H e told me what had happened: 
he’d called home and gotten 
no answer. He’d gone to the house, 
and it hadn’t been lived in for 
months. His space gram was unopen- 
ed, his letters still sealed. Neighbors 
told him she’d often come home 
staggering; they thought she’d been 
drinking. Once they’d found her sit- 
ting on the lawn, crying for her 
daddy and mommy. She’d thought 
she was back on Scrag ... 

“She’d sold the aircar, the furni- 
ture, her clothes, everything. The 
house was bare.” He looked down at 
his hands. “I’d been sending my 
pay to Leeba. She was going to spend 
only what she needed to live on 
and bank the rest, but . .” 

“She didn’t?” 

“Oh, she did. But over a year ago 
she started making big withdrawals. 
She closed out the account two 
months ago.” 

“Seven years’ pay gone?” 

“I’ve still got my completion bo- 
nus. But that’s it.” 

“Over fifty gees? Where’d she 
spend it?” 

“In a place called Harry’s Happy 
Return.” 

“A bar?”

IF 




“An illegal memorigraf parlor. 
That’s where I found her.” 

I felt a letdown. “Then what’s 
the problem? She started tripping 
back into her past while you were 
gone. Now you’re back. So kiss her 
and tell her all is forgiven.” 

“1 could, but she wouldn’t feel 
it. She’s in a memorigraf coma.” 
So there was the problem. He’d 
taken her to two psychs, and they’d 
both told him the same thing. Once 
they went into the coma stage, there 
was no way to bring them out. They 
died in a coma, usually within a 
month or so. 

“I finally found a psych who’d 
just set up his little practice. He’s got 
an idea he wants to try. That’s why 
I need your help, Bork.” 

I tried to find out what he want- 
ed me to do, but he said the psych 
could explain it better. So a half- 
hour later I stood in Bruce Pepke’s 
third-floor back room clinic looking 
down at Leeba, seeing her in the 
flesh for the first time, but — 

So cold, so pale. They’d put a 
lacy gown on her which didn’t inter- 
fere with my vision. Not a lush body 
now; thin and hollow-cheeked. They 
must have fed her through the vein, 
because I saw blue marks on her thin 
arm. She looked around thirty-five, 
but I knew she was only twenty- 
six .. too young to stop her life 
short and start rolling it backward. 

“How long has she been lil^e 
that?” 

Bruce was standing beside me in 
his white jacket. “I understand she’s 
been comatose for over three weeks. 
Prior to that . .” He shrugged. “I 
checked around and got her history 



of memorigraf addiction. She start- 
ed four years ago, using a govern- 
ment-licensed parlor. Two years ago 
she switched to a clandestine parlor. 
So many do, since they want more 
than the legal limit of one hour per 
month. Leeba’s visits grew more 
and more frequent, until finally she 
signed into the place full time. Most 
people can’t afford a constant 
memory trip, otherwise these comas 
would be more common. Leeba 
could — and here she is.” 

I looked at her face and forgot 
my own problem. Her eyelids were 
blue^translucent, like skim milk. I 
saw eye-movements behind them. 

“What’s going on inside her 
head?” 

“She’s there ... in her past. Liv- 
ing it mentally at the rate of a week 
per hour.” 

“I thought they had to be hooked 
up to a recording of their memory.” 
“Not when they’re in a coma. 
The memory circuits go on and on 
and on, until death. At least that’s 
the theory. Nobody’s ever revived 
from a coma, so we’re not sure what 
happens inside the mind.” 

I looked at him. “You think you 
can bring her out?” 

“Maybe . with your help.” 
“What do I have to do?” 

He started talking, and I kept 
thinking: This guy could be a nut, 
Bork. What do you know about the 
brain, or memory? Nothing. Briefly, 
his idea was to make a recording of 
my brain pattern and play it into her 
memory. That way, he thought I’d 
have an independent existence which 
was not controlled by her mind. In 
other words, she’d project me in real, 



THE YOUTH ADDICTS

three-dimensional terms and fit me 
into the memory-world of her own 
past. 

“Is that possible, for a mind to 
contain two people? Won’t it — 
crack?” 

“I doubt it,” said Bruce. “Many 
people carry more than one per- 
sonality inside their heads. The ego 
is only a product of the mind any- 
way. It has no objective reality.” 

I looked at Clay. “Why don’t you 
go in?” 

“I’d have no freedom of action. 
I was in her life, and my role is laid 
out. I couldn’t break out of it. It 
has to be someone she’s never 
known.” 

“Any of a million guys — ” 

“But you grew up on Scrag, Bork. 
That’s where she is. You’ll be fa- 
miliar with her environment.” 

I had to laugh at that. “She was 
an aristocrat and I was a spaceport 
rat. We might as well have been a 
galaxy apart.” 

“Then put it this way. The other 
guys — they might forget. Or mess 
around, play little games inside her 
head. You’re the only one I trust, 
Bork.” 

T rust, I thought. He knew nothing 
of the disease which had riddled 
my moral framework. I gave him a 
sour loojc:. 

“You’re handing me a helluva re- 
sponsibility.” 

“I know.” 

“I ought to beat you head in for 
leaving her. I figured she’d just grab 
another man, but this . ...” I shook 
my head. “You should have left her 
pregnant, anyway.” 



He nodded soberly. “I know. Beat 
my head in if you want. I'm putting 
all I’ve got into this. If I could bring 
her out by pushing a peanut up main 
street while wearing a striped loin- 
cloth, I’d do it. She’s ... all I’ve 
got.” 

And all I had were two more 
months. I could live out the time, 
but I wasn’t really interested. Too 
much like throwing good time after 
bad. Might as well try to salvage 
Clay’s little princess. But I had no 
idea what Bruce expected me to do 
once I got inside her head. It turned 
out that he didn’t either. 

“It’s never been tried,” he said. 
“My theory is that if you make her 
past so damnably unpleasant she 
can’t stand it, she’ll come out of her 
own free will.” 

“How?” 

“That’s something you’ll have to 
decide when you get there. How- 
ever, it would seem to me that — ” 
he coughed “ — one way would be 
to kill her.” 

Clay turned white, but I went 
behind his words and got his mean- 
ing. “You mean, make her think 
she’s dying?” 

He nodded. “And to escape death, 
she’ll snap out of her coma.” 

I thought about it. “I’m not a 
killer.” 

Clay said, “I’ve seen you kill, 
Bork.” 

“Sure, out in the camp. But they 
were berserkers — men at that. 
This . ...” I looked at Leeba’s 
slender throat, her thin nostrils 
moving oh so slowly, the chest rising 
and falling, lifting the two small 
breasts ....

“I can’t do it. No, I just can’t.” 

“You’d be saving her life,” said 
Clay. 

“You couldn’t really harm her 
physically,” said Bruce. “You’d be 
a projection of her mind and nothing 
more.” 

“Bang-utot,” I said. 

“Huh?” They both blinked at me. 

“There’s a planet out near Fomal- 
haut where the natives die by night- 
mare. They dream they’re dying, so 
they die . How do you know she 
won’t?” 

Bruce looked gravely at Clay. 
“It’s a possibility.” 

“She’s dying now, for God’s sake! 
What can we lose?” He looked at 
me. “Bork, I’m begging you!” 

“No, don’t beg. I’ll try. But it’s 
just not my nature to kill beautiful 
women.” 



“No problem there,” said Bruce. 
“I’ll put you under hypnosis. It’ll 
be an automatic command, a com- 
pulsion. You won’t know why you’re 
doing it, you’ll just feel you have 
to.” 

So . there was a sleepy drug 
which turned the world into twilight. 
When I woke up, Bruce made some 
tests and said I was hypnotized. I 
didn’t feel any different, but he told 
me I was programmed to kill. Then 
he put a domed helmet on my head, 
and it was like falling into a hive of 
bees. 

Bzzz-bzzz-bzzzz. 

IH 

I have ego-identity, a concept of /. 
But who am I? 

Slowly the ego grows flesh, like 



THE YOUTH ADDICTS 



75 



pearl-stuff growing on a grain of 
sand. Nerves sprout from the soil of 
the ego-concept. Heart, lungs, kid- 
neys, liver . blood vessels flare 
in a net of red. My chest is thick, my 
t>elly long and flat, my arms and 
legs lithe and strong. I pulse with 
energy. 

I am a man-child. Nine-ten years 
old. Inside a . 

Large room. I see a vaulted ceil- 
ing with portholed lenses condensing 
the rays of a pale red sun. Baby- 
pink light drifts down like layers of 
cotton candy. 

I know that outside lies the world 
of Scrag: snow, ice and cold which 
burns the flesh and turns steel into 
brittle glass. I know more than a 
ten-year-old boy should know — 
about the lighting principle of the 
dome, about other worlds. I remem- 
ber seeing stars grow into suns, plan- 
ets coalescing into seas and con- 
tinents, becoming trees, grass and 
cities .... 

I hear music, a swirl of pipes and 
the keening of a flute. The children 
are dancing: twenty girls, nine boys 
and one adult female. A teacher, or 
chaperone. I can sense her thoughts: 
boredom, anticipation of food, leg- 
weariness and tingles of sex-pleasure 
behind the knees. Many girls dance 
together, because of the shortage of 
boys. The boys dance reluctantly, 
feeling their awkwardness. I am 
aware of them, but they are not 
aware of me. 

Ah . now I see why. I sit against 
the curved wall of the dome, behind 
a rubbery-leaf ed vine which grows 
from a pot of purple soil. One of 
the girls is aware of me. 



A lovely girl ... I think. Slate- 
colored hair whirls about her head 
like dark taffy stirred by a spoon, 
then spirals loosely down her back. 
Her skin is white, but shadowed by 
a dark undercoating. A blue skirt 
bells out from her waist and doesn’t 
quite cover her buttocks. The rest of 
her is sheathed in a leotard so sheer 
that I see its blueness only in the 
inner curve of her elbows and knees. 
The slim torso is unadorned by 
breasts, but her almond eyes glitter 
with a blatant female hunger. I feel 
an age-link with her which has no re- 
lation to the immaturity of our 
bodies. 

Her bee-stung lips pout in my di- 
rection. She frowns, and I feel it in 
my body. 

No! More than that. She saw me, 
and I took form. 

I look down. I wear a dun-colored 
leotard and a sequined girdle which 
passes between my legs like a breech- 
clout. I walk toward her. Movement 
is like liquid flowing. I am wax be- 
ing poured into a mold. I want to 
run and jump; my awkwardness is 
nothing compared to the energy surg- 
ing through me. My senses are 
needle-sharp; the mingled cachet of 
thirty young bodies flows around 
me, tainted by the odor of machine- 
oil and plastic. 

She sees me coming and draws 
away from her partner. He frowns 
at me and walks away. I am no sur- 
prise to him, despite the smallness 
of the group. I must be known here. 

She raises her arms, and I fit my- 
self to her. We are two, then one. 
Her hair against my cheek has the 
dry slickness of moth wings. She

radiates a smell of warm milk and 
honey. Two turns around the floor, 
and I sense her thought: He dances 
... as, so smoothly. Then: Maybe 
he knows the Anpela. 

The word strikes my brain, and 
the knowledge of the intricate dance 
flows into my muscles. I do the 
steps, and a light glows behind her 
eyes. 

“What’s your name?” I asked her. 

She laughed. “Silly. You know.” 

Leeba. I pulled it out of her mind, 
together with all she’d ever done and 
been, a tangled knot of memories 
that burst inside my skull: Leeba 
Knight-Namburi. Eight years of life 
— love, peace, happiness, each day 
a jewel strung on the thread of her 
existence. 

“Leeba,” I said. “What’s my 
name?” 

Her off-white cheeks dimpled. 
“Everybody knows their own name.” 

Bork. I don’t know where it came 
from, but it sounded correct — ex- 
cept that Bork had issued from a 
nightclub strip-singer, fathered by 
a one-eyed spacer on the Sol-Arc- 
turus run. Bork didn’t belong with 
aristocrats. He had a box under the 
Space City dome, where he lived on 
scraps from restaurant kitchens. He 
led spacemen to drink and to wand- 
er and then plundered their pock- 
ets of what remained, but — 

Great God of the Rift! Thirty 
years had passed since my< rodent- 
beginning on Scrag. 

S till, here I was, a man in a boy’s 
body, nursing a grownup purpose 
quite apart from the dance. Why 
was I here? I searched my mind. 



Leeba meanwhile behaved like a 
woman. Her satin cheek pressed 
mine; her warm breath tickled my 
throat. The hard angularity of her 
little-girl body pressed me in strange, 
adult ways. My body ached to merge 
with hers. I loved her as a man 
loves a woman. For an instant the 
straight cylinder of her chest became 
a dual softness pillowed against me. 
Her long waist became shorter, its 
narrowness accented by the swell of 
her hips. Her slim legs acquired a 
curvature of thigh and calf, a 
smoothness of flesh sheathing knee 
and ankle. Her eyes hooked into 
mine, and I felt the hunger of her 
empty womb. 

Surprise exploded in my brain: 
She knows who / am, clever girl. 
She's hiding, too . 

The trigger tripped, and my pur- 
pose burst like a nova inside my 
head: 

KILL! KILL! KILL! 

The impulse seared my brain. I 
felt an urge to vomit on the pearly 
plastic floor. I set my teeth and 
reached into the pouch at my belt 

I drew out a six-inch needle tipped 
with the purple stain of glacwin 
venom, extracted during summer 
from a small flying reptile which 
secreted the poison in two glands be- 
side its beak. Glacwin would give 
her an instant of agony, then death. 

The music stopped. She turned her 
back to me and looked around the 
room, almost as though she were 
offering the chance I needed. But 
something else came first. 

She has to know. 

“Leeba,” I said, “you can’t stay 

here.” 



THE YOUTH ADDICTS

She turned her eyes on me, and 
my mind fizzed into chaos. Sequence 
was shattered into a horrible frag- 
mentation of space-time-matter flut- 
tering down like tom confetti. Her 
eyes were the only reality; they re- 
flected a slender blue-eyed kid in 
dun-colored leotards. It was the only 
identity around, so I grabbed it. 
“You’re talented,” I said. 

She wrinkled her nose. “You mean 
the dance?” 

“Huh-uh. That . jangly stuff, 
broken mirrors flying around.” 

She raised her brows. “Broken 
mirror? Where?” 

I had to try it again. “You can’t 
stay here, Leeba.” 

She frowned. “You mean . 
on the dance floor?” 

“Not the dance. Scrag. At this 
time. It isn’t yours.” 

I felt a taut shimmer in the air. 
The niirror rippled, bent and nearly 
shattered — but not quite. 

“Are you sure you know what 
you’re talking about?” she asked. 

W as I? Why was I here, knowing 
nothing of myself but a sordid 
scrap of youth and the tatters of a 
vagrant’s life? And my purpose — 
to kill — curdled my soul. 1 am not 
my own man. Whose am I? Yours, 
Leeba? 

“You can dance with me again if 
you like.” 

That’s it, Leeba. Under the music, 
do the deed. It’s for her own good 
. isn’t it? I took her in my arms, 
holding the needle between my fin- 
gers with its point outward. I could 
feel her heart pulsing against her 
ribs. I held her tight and swung hef 



around, rehearsing the movement 
which would end her life. The 
quick reversal of the needle, the 
plunge .... 

But she had to know. Had to. 

“Ready, Leeba?” 

“Ready?” 

“To come back with me. It won’t 
hurt.” 

Her eyes knew, but her little-girl 
face puckered in puzzlement “Why 
must I come back with you?” 

I grated my teeth and tried to re- 
member. “Clay? Does that sound 
like a reason?” 

“A kind of dirt? How could that 
be a reason?!’ 

“Not dirt. A man — I think. Don’t 
you know?” 

She shook her head. “I don’t 
know anyone named Clay.” 

Could I be Clay? No, Clay 
was . something else. Cleanness, 
honesty, two pleading brown eyes 
below a vagrant forelock. I was 
Bork, and I had to . had to ... 

Her eyes hooked out my thought. 

“You don’t have to,” she said. 
“Stay here with me. It’s the best 
time.” 

I sent energy pulsing down my 
arm. My waist moved, the needle 
turned. I braced my mind for the 
shuddering convulsion of her death, 
then — 

I was lying on a bed, amid hos- 
pital smells. 

Oh, Leeba, you were right, it was 
the best time, those years on Scrag. 
Lovely youthworld, now it’s gone, 
and I He on a white sheet afflicted 
by an incurable deadly illness. 

“ — Lousy goddam trick!” 

“Now, Bork!”

“Watch him carefully, Doc!” 
“Look out, he’s gonna smash — !” 
I felt the bite of a needle, then 
my muscles turned to oatmeal. When 
I woke up they had me wrapped up 
in a canvas kimono. I couldn’t move, 
so I lay there cataloguing my sur- 
roundings: 

Steelite cot, white walls about the 
size of a third officer’s cabin. A man 
in a doctor’s suit sat at a table mark- 
ing charts; against the wall was a 
metal cabinet equipped with dials. 
Beside it rested a dome-shaped hel- 
met from which protruded a heavy, 
coated cable. 

“Doc,” I grunted. “You the doc?” 
He got up and came over, smooth- 
ing his mustache with his forefinger. 
“I’m a psychiatrist, yes. Bruce 
Pepke.” 

His voice sounded like he was 
speaking through a long hollow tube. 
He bent over the straps, his face set 
in that bland medical mask which 
says there’s nothing at all to worry 
about. That made me nervous — but 
he sprung me from the strait jacket 
and gave me a cigarette, which as 
far as I knew qualified him as the 
best friend I had in the world. 

“Well, Bork, can you tell me what 
happened?” 

“I was back on Scrag — ” I 
stopped. “Or was that a dream?” 
“Did it seem like a dream?” 
Psychiatrists never answer ques- 
tions, they just pile on new ones. 

“It seemed real,” I said. “Realer 
than this, anyway.” 

He nodded. “That’s the effect of 
the memorigraf.” 

“What’s a memorigraf? Maybe 
that’s a dream too.” 



“The memorigraf — you don’t re- 
member that?” 

“I’m cleaned out. Doc. Just a few 
scraps of memory left.” 

“Hmm. She’s got a stronger mind 
than I thought.” He crossed Ins legs 
and eased the crease of his white 
pants. “Suppose you tell me what 
happened, and let me evaluate it. 
Wait, I’U get Clay.” 

IV 

H e came back with a guy around 
twenty-seven whose face was 
puffy from sleep. The circles around 
his eyes showed that he hadn’t slept 
well for several days. He greeted me 
like an old friend, but I had a 
nagging sense of remoteness, as 
though nothing were really happen- 
ing. 

“Doc says you contacted Leeba, 
Bork. How was she?” 

“She was . ...” I frowned at him. 
“Who the hell are you?” 

He drew back and looked at the 
doc, who spoke in that confidential 
way people have around invalids, as 
though you’re a dog or a servant and 
can’t understand English: 

“He’s got a touch of amnesia, 
Clay. Nothing serious.” 

“Clay?” I said. “I mentioned you 
to her. Why?” 

“I’m Leeba’s husband.” 

“You pick ’em young.” 

“Young? I don’t — ” 

“Let me handle this, Clay.” The 
doc leaned forward. “You’re Bork 
Craighen, field personnel supervisor 
for Galactic Minerals. Here’s your 
ID card. Remember?” 

I squinted at the plastic rectangle,

embossed with the curlicued crest 
of GM. It looked familiar. So did 
the battered puss in the photo. The 
psych wiped off a little mirror on 
his pants and held it to my face. 
They matched. 

“Okay,” I said. “That’s the face 
I’m wearing now. But a couple of 
hours ago, or how the hell ever you 
measure time in this featherwig fac- 
tory, I was a blue-eyed blond kid in 
a ballroom. A real silver-spoon 
specimen in a dancing suit. Which is 
real?” 

“You found Leeba in a ball- 
room?” asked Clay. “What — ” 
“Let’s not go too fast,” said the 
doc. “Did you try to bring her 
back?” 

“I tried to shoot her full of poison, 
yes.” I shrugged. “She kicked me 
out. I don’t know how, though.” 

“It was her nind, after all. We 
simply tried to insert your ego into 
it, and she rejected it. That’s all.” 
“Let’s try again, Bruce,” said 
Clay. “While she’s fresh.” 

The doc frowned. “That wouldn’t 
apply. Clay. We can’t be sure she’s 
following a normal time sequence 
back there. She could be skipping 
around, glossing over unpleasant 
memories, drawing out the pleasant 
ones. However . .” 

He reached for the helmet. 

“Now wait,” I said. “Just hold on. 
I’m not going anywhere until I get 
these holes in my memory filled up. 
First, what’s that funny hat?” 

“It’s part of a memorigraf unit. 
We recorded your memory before 
you went in. Now we’ll simply re- 
play your recent past, and you’ll re- 
live it all as it happened.” 



I hesitated, then nodded. The doc 
stabbed me with his needle, and the 
world started spinning. I barely felt 
the hat come over my head, buzz . 
buzz . buzz . and gradually it 
slowed down. 

W e were standing on the ship- 
landing and looking for Clay’s 
wife. She wasn’t there, as I’d expect- 
ed, so I left Clay and went to a 
specialist in ET diseases. He gave 
me two months to get myself ready 
for the Big Blastoff, so I went to a 
bar and tried to console myself with 
a big, loving Venus-colonial chick. 
Then Clay stumbled in and said his 
bride had turned youth-addict and 
gone into a coma. I was the not-so- 
handsome, not-so-young prince who 
was supposed to bring her out of her 
deadly sleep, so ... 

I looked up into the faces of 
Bruce and Clay. I shook my head 
to clear it. 

“This could drive me nuts,” I said. 
“It isn’t memory. I was there, for 
the first time. I can see how Leeba 
got lost in it. Now, exactly when are 
we?” 

“You went into Leeba’s head — ” 
began Clay. 

“Then you came out with amnesia. 
So we put the hat on you to fill in 
your memory. That was a couple of 
minutes ago. Now you’re just coming 
out of that one.” 

I pieced it together in my mind 
until I had it straight: Leeba, the 
little girl in the ballroom, the 
poisoned needle, the lithe lad in leo- 
tards .... 

“That kid,” I said. “I was never 
like that. I even talked educated — 



BO 



IF 




which I’m not. I’ve just read a lot.” 
“That was Leeba’s projection of 
you,” said Bruce. “She had your per- 
sonality in her mind, so she created 
•her own image to go with it. No 
doubt it was highly idealized.” 

“Yeah,” I said, remembering how 
I’d felt: my senses sharp and vivid 
and . young. My own youth had 
been miserable, and the only way 
I’d survived it was by having nothing 
to compare it with. But youth in 
Leeba’s world was wealth, good 
looks, a skill at dancing and conver- 
sation and — she’d give me that 
too — proficiency in the art of love. 
I ached to go back into her mind, 
for a week, a month, a year. As long 
as I could. It didn’t matter. 

But I couldn’t let them know how 
eager I was. 

“Maybe that’s how she could kick 
me out,” I said. “She had control 
and I didn’t.” 

Bruce frowned. “I don’t know.” 
“Maybe if I was conscious, but 
still hooked into her memory — ” 
“It’s never been done. You might 
go crazy. Or die.” 

I felt like laughing. “Doc, that 
really doesn’t matter, believe me. But 
listen — no hypnotic kill order. 
Otherwise I don’t make the trip.” 

“I can wipe out the command,” 
he said. “But then, how will you 
bring her back?” 

“I’ve got an idea,” I said. “You’ll 
have to let me work it out on my 
own. It has to do with the . hell, 
I can’t explain it. You trust me, or 
you don’t.” 

“I trust you, Bork,” said Clay. 

I smiled at him. If he only 
knew .... 



“All right,” said Bruce. “I sup- 
pose you’ll want to rest first, eat, 
wait another day . .” 

Another day of numbness? “No, 
Doc. There’s just one thing, Clay, if 
I die — ” 

“You won’t.” 

“I might. Just bury the old shell 
and forget it. It isn’t important. Re- 
member that. Don’t give it a 
thought.” 

He agreed, but he didn’t under- 
stand. I wrote out a paper leaving 
my fortune to Leeba and Clay, Mr. 
and Mrs. Fortescue, and had the doc 
sign it and certify that I was in my 
right mind. While he was doing that, 
I boosted his scalpel and hid it up 
my sleeve. 

Then he injected me with scopola- 
mine, and I started drifting into the 
twilight zone. He put the domed hat 
on me and another hat on Leeba, 
who lay in a cot beside mine, then 
hooked our heads together with 
wires. 

I t was like a slow blending of two 
worlds, with one picture coming 
in and the other fading out. I could 
see Doc and Clay looking at me, 
while behind them on the white walls 
appeared a grove of trees in the 
Scrag countryside. It was so vivid 
and brilliant that Clay and Doc 
seemed covered with dust and then 
faded out entirely. I smelled the lush- 
ness of growing plants, the humus 
of the forest: I felt strange emo- 
tions: I was a bud about to flower, 
a butterfly laying eggs, a cow swol- 
len with milk, a bee whirling in the 

mad frenzy of the mating swarm 

SPRING! 



82 



IF 




Spring on Scrag. The frenzied 
time, the surge of life after the long 
freeze! 

I was Leeba. No, I was myself, 
inside her head. I saw through her 
eyes and felt with her emotions. The 
shape of her body enveloped me, the 
weight of breasts on my chest, the 
heaviness of hip and thigh. 

We sit in a grove, Leeba and I. 
Giant trees arch four hundred feet 
overhead, their massive trunks a 
rust-red color, like crinkled metal. 
The sunlight filters down through 
the yellow leaves and falls on thick 
blue-green grass. A blue-scaled lizard 
flaps his red leathery wings and flies 
over the clearing with his long yel- 
low crest flowing out behind him. 
Other boys and girls lie about the 
clearing, some dressed in leaves and 
skirts of grass, some wearing nothing 
at all. 

I sensed a calmness in Leeba’s 
mind, also a pleasant fatigue. All day 
she has worked in the forest to 
build her bower: set the green 

saplings so they would arch over, 
then tied them together and laid the 
matted gelo vines on top. She has 
spread the floor with a soft puka 
moss and laid a carpet of blossoms 
at the entrance; hung scented herbs 
from the roof and buried the aphro- 
disiac root of the bakaka beneath 
the threshold. Tonight after the mat- 
ing dance, she will lead a young man 
across the threshold. 

She wonders who he will be, but 
feels no anxiety because the outing 
will last three weeks and the first 
night is not binding. If she doesn’t 
fall in love with him, she will choose 
another, and then another, until she 



finds a husband. Those who fail to 
mate during the coming-of-age tour 
will probably never mate. Another 
reason she feels no anxiety is that 
she knows all her would-be suitors; 
they are boys she grew up with, boys 
of her own social class. 

So she digs her bare toes in the 
grass and waits for the sun to go 
down; the roots are cool and love is 
a warm syrup flowing through her 
loins .... 

I push my thought into her con- 
sciousness: 

Remember me, Leeba? At the 
dance, eight years ago? 

Her memory spins back, the years 
like windows in a lighted train rush- 
ing past. Ah, there I am, the blond, 
blue-eyed, graceful lad in leotards. 
Now the clock runs forward; my 
shoulders broaden, my legs grow 
thick and muscular, my cheeks are 
touched with golden down. I stand 
behind her, a teasing smile around 
my mouth, with yellow hair lying 
on my shoulders. 

^ “Look at me, Leeba.” 

She turns, and her brain crawls 
with revulsion. My smile twists into 
a leer, the twinkling blue eyes glow 
red, demonic. My teeth become 
pointed, yellow-stained, my hands 
curve into claws, my body warps 
into a grotesque hunched horror .... 

“Is this how you remember me, 
Leeba?” 

Her lips trembled. “The . last 
time you had a needle.” 

“Not this time, I promise.” 

She wet her lower lip with her 
tongue. I saw perspiration dampen 
her shoulders, and' I felt the icy knot 
of fear in her stomach. 



THE YOUTH ADDICTS 



83 




“Go away, please! Just go away.” 
I tried to bring back die shape of 
the young man, but I was dissolving 
like soap foam, flaking away like a 
peeling coat of paint. The bird-noises 
in the clearing grew faint and far 
away, and I thought, I must take 
control before she kicks me out 
again. 

JUMP! 

V 

T he sun was lower. Time had 
passed. I was the youth again. 
Grotesquerie was gone. I felt a lusty 
sense of power. I stood alone in the 
clearing, wearing a loincloth of 
woven bark. Where were the others? 
Oh yes, now I heard the splashing 
and laughing. I walked toward the 
sounds, feeling the long muscles slide 
in my legs, and I drew the air like 
wine into my lungs. 

The pool was clear as crystal, its 
surface like shattered mirrors re- 
flecting the trees overhead. I looked 
past die young people splashing in 
the water, and I saw Leeba, lying 
on a rock and watching a flower- 
like animal which clung -to a tree 
and rolled out a long sticky tongue 
to catch flying insects. 

I walked toward her. The green 
of the rocks and the sun filtering 
through the leaves tinted her flesh a 
lemon-yellow. I looked down at her 
nude body and felt a surge of male- 
ness. I laughed. 

She sat up. Her eyes stared, her 
mouth opened to scream. I felt some- 
thing in my hand. I looked down and 
saw a long curved dagger glittering 
in the sun. 



I concentrated, and the dagger be- 
came a silver flower. I knelt and 
held it out to her. 

“I told you it wouldn’t be like 
the last time, Leeba.” 

She searched my eyes; I saw tiny 
beads of perspiration trapped in the 
down of her upper lip. 

“What is it . this time?” 
“You can’t — can you?” 

“If you help me, I can.” 

“Why should I help you?” 
“Because . you want me.” 

I leaned toward her, and her eyes 
grew large. They were the color of 
caramel flaked with gold. I smelled 
the warm salt-tang of sun on flesh 
and — 

— walked along a sidewalk while 
an icy wind sliced across a barren 
landscape. A dome rose up in the 
center of a vast paved court. A girl 
walked ahead of me huddled in a 
parka, cradling her books in her arm. 
I also wore a parka, and fur-lined 
boots. They clumped as I ran toward 
her. A dry stick whipped across the 
sidewalk as I came up beside her, 
drawing the air into my lungs like 
icicles. 

“May I carry your books, Leeba?” 
She turned, her pale oval face 
peering out of the blue-furred hood. 
She was about twelve years old. With 
a flash of her teeth she threw the 
books at me and ran. 

I laughed, then I gathered up the 
books and started inside — 

I nside a warm room. It was full of 
furry stuffed animals. A little girl 
played with a blond, curly-haired 
boy-doll, rocking it in a cradle, purs- 
ing her lollypop lips as she crooned. 



84 



IF 




“Leeba, come out of it,” I said 
with my six-year-old voice. I wore 
shiny shoes and velvet pants, and my 
hair hung in blond curls to my 
shoulders. 

‘‘Go away. I didn’t invite you.” 

I took the doll out of the cradle 
and tore off its head. 

“I’m the one you want, Leeba.” 

Her face screwed up. “Momma! 
Nurse!” 

I jabbed a finger into her ribs. 
“Don’t cry, Leeba,” I said, tickling 
her. “Laugh, Leeba. Laugh, Leeba, 
Leeba leebaleebaleeba — ” 

We fell down together, laughing 
and twisting and rolling on the 
floor — 

— In the forest. 

She lay on her stomach with other 
girls in a circle, talking. I plucked 
out a blade of grass and brushed it 
across the pink sole of her foot. Her 
toes curled, and she looked back 
over her shoulder. 

“I’m always with you,” I said 
and — 

— We stood on the stage of an 
auditorium decorated with paper 
spaceships and stars. She was per- 
haps fourteen, reciting a poem about 
the founding of the colony on Scrag. 
I walked up behind her and pulled 
her pigtail. She whirled, her face set 
in anger. 

“Let’s go back to the summer, 
Leeba.” 

“You . can’t you stay away?” 

“Not when you keep remembering 
me. So let’s go back — ” 

— In the forest, the young people 
sat eating, looking into the campfire. 
I walked up behind her. 

“Mind if I sit beside you?” 



She answered, looking into the 
fire. “There are other spaces. Other, 
girls.” 

“Not for me, Leeba.” I put my 
hand on her shoulder and started to 
caress her .... 

1 stood outside a circle of about 
thirty boys. One boy was beating 
a drum in the center, another played 
a flute. A yellow-haired girl stood 
inside the circle, facing the line of 
boys who marched around in time 
to the music. She wore a dirndl-like 
costume and a blindfold. 

The beat of the music speeded 
up; the boys danced faster. I saw 
Leeba waiting with the other girls 
on the opposite side of the* circle. 

Suddenly the music stopped. The 
drummer rose and took the blind- 
fold off the yellow-haired girl. She 
blinked at the young man who’d 
stopped in front of her, then laughed 
and seized his hand. Together they 
ran into the forest. 

Another girl was pushed, giggling, 
into the center ... a small girl with 
glossy black hair who kept giggling 
as they tied on her blindfold. She 
was paired with a dark, rawboned 
youth. Shyly, looking down at the 
ground, they walked out of the fire- 
light. 

Two more girls, then Leeba. She 
looked wild and wanton. Gold rings 
gleamed in her ears, red boots came 
up to her calves and a spangled skirt 
reached only halfway to her knees. 
She raised her face for the blindfold, 
and her bosom swelled above the low 
blouse. She was the fairest of all, 
and the drum thumped louder than 
before, and the dancing boys devour-

ed her with eyes glinting red in the 
firelight. 

I heard the music swell toward 
crescendo. I ran up and broke into 
the circle. There were angry shouts 
behind me, then the music stopped, 
and they took off her blindfold. 

She looked at me and spat one 
word: “You!” 

She whirled and ran, red boots on 
flashing white legs. I ran after her, 
bounding over the spongy turf and 
into the forest. Laughter followed 
me, along with girlish yelps and 
shouts of encouragement from the 
boys. 

She tripped on a tasseled boot and 
fell; I landed on top of her. She 
writhed and twisted, but I caught her 
waist between my knees and pinned 
her wrists to the ground. She stretch- 
ed her neck and yelled: “Help! 

Help!” 

“They won’t come, Leeba.” 

She went limp and lay panting. 
“You cheated. You weren’t in the 
dance when they blindfolded me. I 
looked.” 

“ You cheated. You’re supposed to 
take me to your bower.” 

“I won’t.” 

“All right. Seems a shame to waste 
it, but . 

I bent down, but the mirror 
warped, shimmered like a wet win- 
dowpane. 

“No, Leeba. Not another one of 
your backward trips. This is the best 
time, you told me that.” 

“I hate you. I hate — ” 

I stopped her words with my lips 
— and suddenly I knew what hooks 
the youth-addict. It wasn’t memory 
of the first kiss, it was ... the first 



touch of girl-flesh, the first crackling 
surge of electricity up my legs, the 
clutch of my lungs, the runaway 
thumping of my heart. 

It was the same for her. I heard 
the hiss of air through her nostrils, 
felt the heat of her face and the 
soft relaxation of her body. Her arms 
went hesitantly, then strongly around 
my back. After a moment I whisper- 
ed hoarsely: 

“Where is your bower?” 

She rose and took my hand and 
led me silently through the forest. 
Stooping, she led me into the per- 
fumed bower. I heard the soft creak 
of moss as she lay down, saw the 
dim glow of her body and the sheen 
of her golden earrings. 

A long time later she asked: “Who 
are you?” 

“Bork.” 

“How did you get here?” 

I put my hand on her forehead. 
“You brought me, through here. I’m 
a friend of Clay, your husband.” 

She sat up suddenly. “That hasn’t 
happened yet.” 

“For me it has.” 

“You come from the future?” 
“Leeba, you know how it is. Don’t 
you?” 

“I want you to tell me, Bork.”

left, I have a little more. A month 
there. That’s fourteen years here — 
if you decide to stay.” 

“Could you stay with me?” 

“For awhile. But eventually they’ll 
unhook me. After a few hours, a day 
at the most. I’d be with you a few 
months, maybe a year, then I’d be 
gone.” 

“But if I remembered you, and

“Don’t forget I’m still back there. 
It’s my conscious will that keeps me 
going. Once they unhook me, I’m 
out of it. You couldn’t keep the 
illusion going, now that you know 
it’s an illusion.” 

She was silent a long time, then 
she said. 

“Awhile ago . nothing happen-

“Yes. It happened.” 

“But not really. I couldn’t have a

“Not a real baby, no.” 

“But — it was so perfect. So

“You know. The little house, Clay,

“Like we are now, yes. that’s 
right.” 

“How?” 

“Just relax, Leeba. You’re getting 
sleepy. Close your eyes and let your 
muscles flow. Trust me. I’ll take 
care of you. I’ll always be with you. 
You’ll have Clay, but you’ll have me 
too. 

“There’ll be no more unhappi-

have a child, too, you and Clay, but 
I’ll be with you all the time. You’ll 
be able to see me, but nobody else 
can. Well have to talk silently . .” 

She slept. I visualized the little 
room, the bare clinic walls. I built 
up a picture of Clay and the psych 
sitting there; I saw the wires running 
from the helmet on my head to the 
head of Bork on the other cot. Slow- 
ly the picture formed, shimmered, 
and . jelled. 

I rose . Leeba’s body rose from 
the cot. I had to work quickly. Her 
legs were weak, but I had the ad- 
vantage of surprise. Clay only gaped 
at me and said: 

“Leeba!” 

The doc was starting out of his 
chair. I reached down and took the 
scalpel from the sleeve of Bork, and 
with one last look at the scarred 
face Fd worn for thirty-six years, 
slashed with all my strength beneath 
the stubbled chin. 

Blood gushed out over my arm, 
all over Leeba’s filmy nightdress. 
Then the room started tilting, and 



I had my first horrible doubt. Did J 
figure it wrong? Everything went 
black and I thought: / was wrong 
about her, she kicked me out again 
and I’m dying .... 

T hen I opened my eyes and look- 
ed up into Clay’s pale, horror- 
striken face. 

“Why, Leeba. Why?” he said . 
to me. 

I looked over and saw Bork lying 
in a pool of his own blood. He 
wasn’t breathing. 

“It doesn’t matter, Clay.” 

“But — Bork saved your life! 
And you cut his throat!” 

“Of course. But it doesn’t matter. 
He was going to die anyway. Ask 
Doctor Pinwit. Didn’t Bork tell you 
it didn’t matter?” 

“Yes . yes he did, but — ” 
Then he gasped something about 
seven years being a long time, and 
I saw him bending down to kiss me. 
I gave a loud shout inside my head: 
Leeba , wake up. 

Sleepy-sounding voice. What hap- 
pened? 

It worked. We’re back. But you’ll 
have to take over on this . 

I felt myself dwindling down. 
Then I was the young man of the 
forest again, standing beside the cot 
and looking down at Leeba, who 
was being kissed by Clay. She reach- 
ed up and took my hand and squeez- 
ed it tight, and I thought, well, here’s 
to a long and interesting life. END

THE LONG, 
SLOW ORBITS 

by H. H. HOLLIS 

Illustrated by FINLAY 



Nice prison! It was a Klein bottle 
in orbit — easy to escape from, if 
you didn't mind turning inside out! 



I 

I was taping indiscretions at a 
morning reception in the Israeli 
Embassy when I saw Gallegher hid- 
ing behind two experts in nuclear 
desert reclamation. We exchanged 
glances and assembled at the bar, 
where I saw that he had a grotesque 
pattern of hairline scars cutting 
whitely into his rusty Martian tan. 

“Have you become a consul for 
some slowly developing nation too 
poor to afford real diplomats?” I 
asked. 



He laughed. “No, I’m a house 
guest here, sort of. Why don’t you 
ask me about these scars?” 

“You look,” I replied, “like a 
chicken thief who never heard of 
charged fences. Is that six-inch hex- 
agonal grid all over you?” 

Gallegher drew himself as near- 
ly erect as any tramp rocket jockey 
will (they don’t like to be mistaken 
for space Navy men) and said, 
“These are the heroic scars of a 
conductor on the underground rail- 
road.” 

“On the what?" 



89 





Just then I was swept away by 
a loud argument between two diplo- 
mats famed for the personal and 
political enmity, but Galeg shout- 
ed, “Lunch!” 

Over the second bottle of a sturdy 
Hock in the Embassy’s great public 
dining hall, Gallegher leaned a>vay 
from the dead luncheon plates and 
told me about the chicken wire. 

T he girl (he said) was an Israeli; 

that is, a citizen of the Greater 
Near East Co-Prosperity Sphere. It 
was the summer after I broke my 
ankle testing that crazy English- 
man’s “space bicycle” — you re- 
member? It was going to make ser- 
vicing the weather and communi- 
cations satellites so easy? Well, I 
fell off Tiros Ten while it was in 
a north-south pass. I cratered in 
Central Canada, and the Toronto 
therapists sent me up north to the 
Arctic Ocean, so I could strengthen 
my ankle. I was staying at the Hil- 
ton T-5, on an ice island about a 
hundred and fifty miles from the 
geographic Pole, and hiking a ran- 
dom route over the pack ice every 
day. The up and down and sliding 
all were supposed to strengthen up 
my ankle ligaments. 

One day I saw a girl stalking a 
polar bear. We were both wearing 
parkas, and I thought she was an 
Eskimo. The bear had tolerated her, 
just waving its paw and growling 
every now and then, but it saw 
me and decided two human beings 
on its trail was one too many. It 
just slid over the edge of the ice 
and took off for open water — or 
another ice island, I guess. 



Harriet turned and saw me then, 
and came bounding over the ice, 
waving her spear and shouting. 
“You’re supposed to help! I would 
have shared. Now I’ve lost the sport 
and you’ve lost the meat, freeze 
you!” 

She saw the color of my skin 
just about the time I could see hers, 
and pulled up short. “Oh,” she 
cried, “you couldn’t be an eskimo, 
not with that pelt!” 

“No, sweetheart,” I replied, “and 
that Mediterranean profile and black 
olive complexion of yours never 
came from Hudson’s Bay, either. 
I’m sorry I spoiled your game.” 

“Sorry all hagan! Every Earth- 
man thinks he can make anything 
all right just by saying, ‘I’m sorry.* ” 

That aerated my fuel a little. “As 
for that, I’m more Mars than Earth- 
man,” said I. “And a good day to 
you, ma’am, for the next two months 
of it.” 

She sank the spear point in the 
ice with pique, and muttered to her- 
self. “She-hagan . another iron 
man — lost in space without a 
hot tube and a computer to bring 
him home.” 

Then I knew who she was, from 
the newstapes. “So-ho, you’re the 
little Yemenite sailor-girl who made 
a fool out of Space Admiral Rogos- 
sovsky?” 

She smiled a bit at that. “Oh, 
well, rockets can hardly deal with 
a craft like mine. A sun sailor 
moves with the organic forces of 
the universe . and besides, the 
light quanta pushes it so slowly a 
rocket is useless when it matches 
speed to the Sunbeam”

IF 




“Is that the name of your tube?” 

“She’s no tube. There’s not even 
an auxiliary aboard. When I shove 
off from an asteroid and spin out 
Sunbeam's sail to the solar wind, 
I’m on my own.” Her hood was 
thrown back now, and she smiled 
a real primitive grin, all over her 
face. 

“Tricky navigation?” I asked. 

“Oh well! You have to know 
how to do it. There’s so much real 
estate in the Ring, though, that you 
can always make a landfall some- 
where; unless you’re fool enough 
to sail right up from the sun out 
of the Ring. Then you might broach 
to and let that old fireball blow 
you right up to Pluto.” 

I t pleased me that she thought of 
that direction as “up.” I’ve al- 
ways felt myself it was “up” to 
Mars and “down” to Earth instead 
of “out” and “back.” 

You don’t need to know all we 
said after she realized I was an old 
space hand. By the time we tramped 
back into the village, we were old 
bear-hunt mates, and she set out 
to recruit me for her crusade. 

I wouldn’t have believed her story, 
written out, but I couldn’t disbelieve 
it when I was looking at her. She 
wore an anklet of those blue ceramic 
beads. After that first day, it might 
as well have been around my neck. 

You remember the public part of 
it. Harriet appeared on the vidcasts 
when she was discovered sailing a 
long, serene track well inside the 
orbit of Mars. Admiral Rogossovsky 
reacted like the clockwork bureau- 
crat he is and made a heroine out 



of her when she defied him and his 
whole Navy couldn’t catch her. 

Between the public’s chuckling 
and the professionals’ pleased ap- 
praisal of her antiboarding devices, 
Tojo Rogossovsky lost every round. 
It was bad enough that every time 
one of those hot Navy tubes would 
damp the flame down enough to 
match velocities with Harriet’s Sun- 
beam, she’d float one of those glass 
bottles with a firecracker in it over 
and blow the Navy’s matching tra- 
jectory into a Riemann parallel; but 
when the Old Man ordered his 
greenjackets to get out of their 
pipes and use their zot-guns to 
capture Harriet, they wouldn’t do 
it. Who wants a firecracker in a 
glass globe up against his faceplate? 
And it’s an all-volunteer service 
anyway, so ... I should have 
known there was something about a 
girl who could think up a device like 
that. But she was only five foot 
two, about a hundred and twenty 
pounds, raven-wing hair that she 
could sit on when it was undone, 
and a way of hanging on to my par- 
ka and looking up into my face 
that made me feel I was somebody 
special. 

She was somebody special, and 
her specialty was to subvert the 
economy of the Asteroids. Harriet 
was running an escape route for 
cyborgs. 

That’s why the sailing trip. She 
had chased down that asteroid with 
the eccentric orbit that brings it in- 
side the orbits of the inner planets, 
and left there a half-living machine 
that she had stolen. She was actual- 
ly leaving the inner solar system

when Admiral Rogossovsky and his 
radar techs picked her up. 

I see you’re shocked by the idea 
of cyborgs. You know they’re ille- 
gal down here and on Mars. Don’t 
forget there’s no law in the Aster- 
oids. By law, the Ring has been 
left free to find its own economy. 

Just you remember this: anything 
that technology can do ... at a 
profit . will be done, some- 
where. 

II 

H arriet explained to me how it 
got started. 

First thing, they have a lot of 
freak accidents in the Ring. One 
of the freakish aspects is that an 
accident is often catastrophic but 
not fatal. What’s to be done, then, 
with a basketful of viable organs, 
missing only eyes and limbs, say, to 
be a person? Down here where it 
happens so much more rarely, we 
bany the pieces and throw away the 
personality. When we use the replace- 
ment parts, we have to suppress im- 
munity reactions and put up with 
the fact that the pieces are the 
wrong size and all that. But we’ve 
got people running out of our ears. 
We can afford to discard person- 
alities. 

In the Ring, it’s the other way 
’round. They’re few on people and 
many on machines; and a remnant 
really adapts better to nylon and 
platinum and stainless steel prosthe- 
sis than the individual organs do to 
being life-grafted onto somebody 
else. After the operations, you may 
have a something/somebody that’s 



just right for riding a big chunk of 
ore round and round the Ring, 
operating the smelter by being wired 
right into it, and dropping a load 
straight “down” to Earth when the 
two orbits are right. 

That’s were the Ring-wallahs 
make money: on the shipping. Costs 
are next to nothing. Gathering the 
stuff is expensive; and going up for 
a load after it falls into orbit around 
Earth costs money; but the low mass 
everywhere in the Ring makes ship- 
ping as cheap as vacuum. When the 
computer says, “Push,” you can 
push a load with your hand or with 
one of those firecrackers — Tojo 
Rogo cocktails, they call ’em? — 
in the right direction, and that’s 
all it takes. 

Now, you turn half or three- 
quarters of the gathering over to a 
half-live machine that runs on a 
barrel of vitamins, a little green- 
house to recycle the oxygen and 
the wastes, and a yearly mainten- 
ance call to replace a few transis- 
tors and vacuum tubes, and hook 
the device into a “cyborg central” by 
radio, helio and teevee; and instead 
of a hole in the fuel tank, you’ve 
got a fuel breeder. Money’s money, 
everywhere in the universe, even 
in enterprises that are theoretically 
cooperative, like a kibbutz. 

So you see what happened, don’t 
you? In the blurred legal nowhere 
of the Ring, it ended up so that who 
paid for the surgical operations 
owned the hardware; and sad to 
say, Mrs. Stowe and Uncle Tom to 
the contrary notwithstanding, when 
you own a being’s body, you also 
own its/his soul.

And Harriet, poor Harriet, her 
clan hadn’t even been moved out of 
Yemen until after the Greater Near 
East Co-Prosperity Sphere imploded 
from the war against the Pakistani 
Dictatorship. When she was thir- 
teen years old, she was literally jet- 
ted a thousand years, from a pre- 
feudal patriarchate into a bustling 
industrial nation. 

I t was all a little much for her, 
and when she was eighteen, she 
shipped over to a mining kibbutz 
in the Ring. 

The only person who kicked out 
to it with her was a boy from her 
clan. He was only fourteen or fif- 
teen, so she was leader. Even in 
the kibbutz, though they cooperated 
cheerfully with its system of ab- 
sorbing immigrants, the two of them 
constituted a kind of irreducible 
fraction. The kibbutz itself was 
breaking up under the pressure of 
the new economic conditions in the 
Asteroid Belt; every day a little 
less of a cooperative and a little 
more of a competitive enterprise. 
Then her friend got hurt. 

Oh, “Mordecai” was saved. “He” 
came out about the size of an IBM 
00701, with bellows pumping and 
gauges registering, and three kinds 
of light receptors to see different 
bands of the spectrum; but not ex- 
actly adapted any more to wan- 
dering off to the shady side of a 
rock chunk and talking philosophy. 
He was anchored to a million-ton 
drift of cinnabar with a hotel room 
full of auxiliary machines. Then he 
started reducing tihe ore to flasks 
of mercury isotopes. 



At that time, “Mordecai” could 
see and talk and had tracks on 
which he could move. However, it 
wasn’t long until he got into an 
argument with the mine operator 
who owned his hardware. This man 
was a curious, cruel sort, well on 
his way to becoming the dominant 
force in the Ring. His methods were 
fast becoming any act by pointing 
to the competition. Harriet always 
called him “The Sheik,” which ought 
to give you some idea of his atti- 
tudes toward people . and 
people /machines. 

How can a machine feel cruelty, 
you ask. So did I. I hadn’t stopped 
to think that these machines are 
sentient. The owner could switch 
one out of the television circuit, 
you see, for a mild punishment; or 
disconnect the light receptors, a 
little worse; or cut one out of the 
voice radio and restrict it to Morse. 
At the last, when the one rotter 
got really rotten, he would cut off 
everything except the restricted 
senses needed for the mine or the 
smelter. 

The cyborg would just drift in 
darkness for a year or more, working 
without knowing when or if any- 
thing else was going to happen, 
not able to ward off meteors or 
monitor the sunlight. 

The Sheik had lost the whole 
point, you see, and was indulging 
in cruelty for cruelty’s sake. Origin- 
ally, he promised incentives for more 
production or better shipping. He 
was going to go to color teevee for 
real producers. There was going to 
be rotation on the jobs, to break 
the monotony. A teevee band would 



94 



IF 




be left free for experimental drama 
and dance by cyborgs. Typewriters 
would be added to die circuitry of 
any cyborg that came up with a 
usable suggestion. Oh, he talked a 
machine dream, for a while. 

None of these promises ever ma- 
terialized, but he began to exact 
penalties of the milder kind: sight 
and sound. Fear followed . both 
ways. 

The more he punished his cyborgs, 
the more he feared them, until at 
last his cruelties — lowering their 
available oxygen, shutting down 
their senses to the level of mechani- 
cal efficiency, beating them (get 
that bright and sharp on your mind’s 
teevee, would you) so some of their 
mechanical members were bent, 
making it hard for them to work 
— his cruelties came to be done to 
exact respect and to. “keep the steel- 
colored sonofamarches in their 
place,” rather than in any rational 
attempt to raise production. 

Production was dropping, of 
course. The Ring was not a place 
for a slave economy. 

He lost a couple of the half-living 
by shutting them down to machine 
status. Meteors smashed the green- 
house on one, and a sunstorm cook- 
ed the vegetation in another. He saw 
to it that the carcasses were displayed 
on the video. “Example to the in- 
solent.” 

W orse than these calculated 
cruelties were the wanton ones. 
The Sheik carried a fifty-inch screw- 
driver to reach and tighten connec- 
tions that otherwise would have re- 
quired extensive dismantling, and 



sometimes he would lay it across two 
or three exposed terminals, pro- 
ducing a shower of sparks. "Remind 
’em who’s boss,” he would say, 
while the poor devil shook with 
oscillation, trying to restore the elec- 
tric equilibrium. 

He even wired his office record 
handler so that she shocked herself 
in handling the routine work load. 
Played hagan with the records, of 
course, but the Sheik didn’t care. 
“Gussie loves me,” he would say. 
“Don’t you, you steel-colored old 
bucket of bolt?” 

And if she didn’t answer, “Yes 
sir!” cheerfully, he would punch in 
a sequence that always shorted her 
out. 

Not all this madness was appar- 
ent. Harriet automatically suspicious, 
a little paranoid about herself be- 
cause of her own history, telescop- 
ing years and light-years, you might 
say. She was a loner even when 
“Mod” had been fully human and 
fully movable. Her paranoia was 
fed by his accident, and that’s when 
she began sailing. 

While she was out there riding 
the winds of the sun in total iso- 
lation, hung in the center of that 
great main sheet, a single layer 
of molecules thick, she was anxiety 
free. Like a rich man sitting on a 
park bench, she could see in every 
direction. Nobody could sneak up 
on her. 

Technically, or politically, Har- 
riet was a full cooperative member 
of the kibbutz. Sun jamming was 
a popular sport, and nobody ques- 
tioned her solitary sailing. Nobody 
realized, either, that she was hunt-

ing Mordecai. The way she told me, 
it would have been impossible to 
establish that his location was be- 
ing concealed. But every set of 
coordinates the Sheik’s “Gussie” 
gave her was wrong. 

The second time it happened, she 
realized something more than a mis- 
placed datum was operating. After 
that, she was too cautious to ask 
the office cyborg again and be- 
gan to sail around the Ring in a 
series of exploratory curves that 
would have made a tight spiral 
around the “regular” Asteroid Belt 
if she’d had to complete it. 

Lucky Harriet made a landfall on 
Mordecai’s cinnabar eddy within a 
month or two of the time she started 
her purposeful search. Sure enough, 
the Sheik had cut him out of every- 
thing but the Morse circuit, deprived 
him of all light reception below 
ultraviolet and removed his tracks. 
There he was, not much more than 
a sophisticated monitor, when she 
began talking encouragement into 
his sound sorters. They worked out 
a plan that required he stay there 
and sweat bolts while she stole and 
roused enough of the others to tip 
the battle against the Sheik. 

But she needed another hand. 

She told me all this in her igloo. 
The blubber pile in mine was pretty 
rank because somebody had put a 
bar of perfumed soap in it, and the 
flavor of every piece in the pile was 
affected; but Harriet’s was all nicely 
rotted seal, whale, and bear meat; 
so we were mostly in her place 
when we were inside. 

Doesn’t the whole story open up 
your seams? I tell you, she had 



me oscillating in sympathy with 
those poor half -live coggers. There! 
I’m sorry I said that. She made me 
realize it’s an opprobrious term; 
but it’s hard to get out of old 
bad habits. 

Ill 

1 helped her. I’m proud of that. 

Me, that never stole a machine 
in his life, not so much as an in- 
ear radio. I helped that chunky, 
spunky little girl cognap every shape 
and size of half-life you could im- 
agine. “Coggerstealers” was the 
kindest thing the owners called us 
when they realized what was hap- 
pening. We gloried in the name. 
We made ourselves as feared as 
oxygen pirates. 

For a long time, we kept the 
operators in the dark about who 
we were. We had put up an awful 
good smokescreen by having become 
apparent lovers on the ice island. I 
moved into her igloo. I’d have al- 
most done it just to get her blubber 
pile, but of course it’s nice to have 
somebody to talk to. Before I real- 
ized her sympathy was reserved for 
the prosthetically extended, I told 
her a routine precautionary romance 
about how a tornado of cosmic rays 
had caught me over Mars on a 
cargo pipe and altered my gene 
structure so that I couldn’t ever 
marry. 

So it never occurred to her that 
a brother and sister, can’t-tell-the- 
boy-from-the-girl-without-a-program 
kind of relation wasn't suiting me 
fine. I never could get the proper 
emphasis on the second day’s in-

stallment of my story because she 
was so well launched into hers by 
that time, grinning and crying and 
acting out all the parts. She under- 
stood nothing had been altered 
about me but my genetic code. She 
just didn’t think it was important. 
Harriet was accommodating enough; 
she was a nicely brought up girl; 
but there was no emotional in- 
vestment. 

I was ready to light the flame 
and get out of there in a few days 
and start rescuing the slave ma- 
chines; but she felt we had to 
stay around for a couple of weeks 
to let our “love affair” become pret- 
ty well known. For a girl, she 
was mighty crafty. 

I don’t believe I ever really got 
her attention until the third or fourth 
day after I moved in with her. 
You’ve stayed in igloos, haven’t 
you? Well, you know the heat comes 
from your own body and a little 
oil lamp, a soapstone bowl of whale 
oil with a moss wick. You wear 
those everlasting pants and boots 
and parkas all the time. Eskimos 
don’t; but they like it cold; and 
there are always a lot of people in 
an eskimo igloo. I saw more of 
Harriet by the hotel pool than I 
ever did in the igloo. 

But about sleep time the third 
or fourth day, I said to her, “How 
about blowing this lamp out? I’ve 
learned to savor the taste of blubber, 
but I can’t learn to like the smell 
of it burning.” Harriet giggled and 
said she’d only left the wick alight 
because she thought I wanted it. I 
snorted the flame out, and it was 
totally dark. 



W hen I woke up, I wanted a 
light so I could see to get 
the wick burning again. I had a 
little old hand-squeezed generator 
flashlight — you remember, with 
the works visible through plastic 
sides? and you squeeze a little plun- 
ger handle? When you’ve got the 
armature turning fast enough, it 
generates enough electricity to light 
a little wire filament bulb. Gives 
about as much light as a second 
magnitude star peeking in a cave 
entrance. 

About the second or third squeeze, 
I had enough light to see Harriet 
in midair. The flash had startled her 
out of a dream of sun-sailing alone. 

Whatever the world’s record is for 
the lying down high jump, she broke 
it. Turned over the blubber lamp 
too, so I had to keep squeezing the 
dag-blagged little machine to get 
enough light try to comfort her. 
Her irrational fright reaction had 
jarred my gyro too, and I couldn’t 
think to crawl over and pull back 
the skins at the entrance tunnel. You 
don’t get much light that way, but 
with the sun “up” twenty-four hours 
a day, you get enough to see ob- 
jects. 

Believe me, putting your arms 
around a fairly athletic girl clad 
in loose skin garments while she’s 
running around the walls of an 
igloo in the dark, cursing and pray- 
ing in the South Arabian Peninsula 
Hebrew dialect of her childhood, 
and you’re squeezing a hand gener- 
ator for what little light you can 
get, is a unique experience. Every 
time my hand would run down, 
she’d start hollering, “Ohr! Ohr!”

(Light, you know), and I’d have to 
start pumping some more. 

I knew then what my grandfather 
meant when he gave me that little 
old antique. He was a New York 
politician, did you know that? and 
he kept that flashlight to help him 
home in the power failures. He 
laughed when he gave it to me and 
said that he’d always been safe in 
the blackout because he was a 
politician; he could see his way 
home just by shaking hands all the 
way. And my hand was as sore 
the next day as if I’d been elected 
President of the Federated U. N. 

When I finally got her quieted 
down, we were a whole lot better 
friends than we’d been before. I 
wasn’t so much in awe of the hero- 
ine who’d fought and sailed her way 
through the middle of Tojo Rogo’s 
whole space navy. She’d had a new 
look at me, as somebody who didn’t 
quit just because the seams were 
opening up. A woman always thinks 
more of a man who’s lived through 
a helping of hysteria with her. 

The one part of the happening 
that ought to have been significant 
to me, but wasn’t, was Harriet’s 
reaction when I wouldn’t make her 
a gift of granddaddy’s generator. 
She thought it was just a toy, you 
see; but when I told her the story 
and explained why I couldn’t give 
the little momento away, she soft- 
ened up and all at once. 

She pulled me back in under the 
bed skins with her, and said, “Oh-h, 
you’re a real person, after all. Bring 
your grandfather’s little machine in 
here with you. I would never have 
guessed you are so sentimental.” 



I remembered that when it was 
too late to do me any good. 

W e finally shoved off to our 
work. If I ever have a honey- 
moon, I want to take it in a two- 
place sunjammer. Unfortunately, 
Harriet’s little vessel (a loose fit for 
one) was snugger than the fat man’s 
spacesuit in the story for two. We 
had to work out a kind of drill 
by the numbers even to work the 
direction finder or swing the sail. 
So we had to take a hot pipe to 
the deep space cosmological re- 
search station beyond Mars and 
launch our little candy wrapper from 
there. 

Even so, I fell in love with sun- 
sailing. Barring the storms (and 
you know about them when they 
start up from Old Sol), almost 
nothing deflects you from a well 
plotted course. You spin the sail 
out to full circle, set your course 
by using two hand-wound gyros, 
and then you can switch off every 
device that makes noise aboard. You 
coast out there in that golden breeze 
of light quanta as unconcerned and 
easy as if you were in the womb of 
the universe, waiting for the first big 
bang. The sail’s big enough to be 
washed by varying waves of sun- 
light, and it really does ripple, or 
seem to, anyway. You go outside 
and hook a mile of that monofila- 
ment line onto the after handling 
cleat, turn your toes down to the 
sun, and let the sail carry the ship 
up from you. The only noise you 
hear is your own blood stream, 
still counting Earth time . may- 
be your own digestive tract, con-

verting something or moving it . 
I tell you, you own the solar sys- 
tem. 

You can’t get lost. There’s Sol 
at your feet and straight up over 
your head, there he is again, mul- 
tiplied in a great shimmering mir- 
ror. One day I took a ten-mile hank 
of that line out. After all, how much 
mass has it got? Each fiber is just 
one long molecule, for practical pur- 
poses. They only make it up to the 
diameter of a blonde hair so you 
dan see it. The strength of the line 
doesn’t require that thickness. 

I lay out there so peacefully I 
went to sleep and paid out the whole 
coil. When I woke up, for as much 
as a minute I believed I was alone, 
and the whole universe was just my 
idle daydream. Luckily for all the 
rest of you, I didn’t change any 
of the apparent laws of our time 
and space before I came all the 
wav awake. 

Believe me, climbing a ten-mile 
line hand over hand, taking it up 
as you go, is a lot of exercise. You 
have to keep pulling* too, slow and 
easy. If you try to do it all in 
one jerk, your hand orientation may 
pull you a course half a mile from 
the craft. Then when you suddenly 
notice, you’re about to pierce the 
sail, you’ve got to brace up so hard 
on the line that you impart a new 
direction to the vessel along a vector 
you can’t even calculate because of 
the peculiar way you achieved it. 
When you get back aboard, you’ve 
got to switch on the direction finder 
and take on all that static that 
goes with it. Your eardrums aren’t 
used to it any more, and it seems 



somehow to shrink the solar system 
right down around your shoulders. 

I was worn out when I got back 
in from that ten-mile gymnasium 
climb; but Harriet was furious. I 
thought at first she wasn’t going to 
let me in. Believe me, the way we 
had to pull that little craft up 
around our hips to fit just so, I 
couldn’t get in unless she let me. 

I had got bored, hauling in, and 
pulled too hard and at irregular in- 
tervals. The peculiarity I had im- 
parted to our course would have 
taken us right out the top of the 
solar system. Yes sir! Almost right- 
angled to the plane of the ecliptic. 
Well, we wouldn’t have gone, be- 
cause we were still in the plane; but 
our sail was edge on to the sun and 
beginning to crumple. 

I was tired when I got inboard; 

but by the time we finished hand- 
cranking those two gyros to turn 
that little sun witch back ninety 
degrees into the true course and got 
the sail spun back out to the full 
circle, I was perishing. 

By that time, Harriet was laugh- 
ing at me, but she couldn’t help me 
anyway. We’d had to go in and 
out to get the sail round rigged 
again, so we were full suited, helmet 
and all. When she blew out the air 
letting me in, we had exhausted 
one bank of air producers, and 
Harriet was laughing so hard she 
couldn’t get the connections chang- 
ed, and that was a job that only 
she could do, the way we fitted 
in. I had water in the suit, but 
no food. Who knew there was go- 
ing to be a crisis? 



100 



IF 




I nearly starved before she calm- 
ed down and got the air pres- 
sure up to where I could rip off 
my helmet and ingest a couple of 
food bulbs. After all, I have moved 
and controlled enough mass to be 
equivalent to about a week of 
decathlons in high gravity. 

That was the last of our high 
jinks on the trip. Somehow, when 
the dogs on the hatches were tight 
and we were back on course, we 
both got to thinking about the grim 
rock chunks to which we were 
bound; and although the rest of the 
voyage was just beautiful and we 
were just as isolated as before, 
something about the fact that we 
were bent on an illegal purpose 
made us feel that we were being 
watched and spied on. We both got 
a little twitchy. 

When we were twenty-four hours 
down the plane from the admin- 
istrative asteroid of her kibbutz, Har- 
riet furled the sail. She went about 
it with great precision, and very 
quickly,, but with an air of ab- 
straction and watchfulness. When we 
were coasting, slowly closing on 
the big asteroid, and sure our course 
was true, she came back in, aired 
the chamber up full and rich, as 
thick as at sea level on Earth, took 
off her helmet, shook out her hair 
and laid her head on my shoulder. 

In a minute, the collar of my 
suit liner was wet. 

I did what I could, but I didn’t 
know why she was crying. She call- 
ed me a pet name, never mind what. 
“I never cared if it was just me . 
but I can’t bear to think you might 
be killed; it’s not your fight.” 



I had to lay on the nobility. I 
believe “the cause of all mankind” 
is what I called the crusade for 
cyborg civil rights. I wasn’t ashamed 
to say it then, and I’m not ashamed 
to say it now. Finally, Harriet smiled 
and tossed her hair so it floated 
round her head in a black flame. 
She dogged down the inner ports 
to shut out the light on which we’d 
travelled so many knots. The in- 
strument lights gave us about a 
foot-candle of dimness, and she 
grinned like a fourteen-year-old 
getting ready to kiss her first man. 
“I’m sorry,” she said, “that I haven’t 
got a blubber lamp for perfume.” 
But I didn’t miss it. 

IV 

W hen we undogged the ports, a 
hot little rocket from the big 
asteroid was putting off to tow us 
in. We debarked, gave our identify- 
ing- blood samples, put up with the 
single entendre comments of the 
“customs officer,” and filed a “vaca- 
tion sailing plan.” “Vacation” meant 
we didn’t have to stay in the com- 
munications net, as working sunjam- 
mers did; and I see you see that 
meant we could be anywhere. No- 
body would know for certain. In fact, 
we were free to range the Ring 
committing our immoral thieveries 
of property for the moral purpose of 
freeing personalities from bondage. 

If you can think of a better life 
than technically flouting one set 
of society’s rules in order to adhere 
to another, more fundamental set 
of the same laws, and doing it in 
the company of a beautiful, intelli-

gent, accessible woman, tell me 
about it; because I can’t. 

Between forays, I enjoyed watch- 
ing Harriet play the game in the 
kibbutz social hall. She was radiantly 
beautiful then, with her arm in 
mine, talking everybody’s talk about 
us getting a couple of mines go- 
ing and settling down. Then she’d 
wrinkle her nose and call for some 
old tune from the youngster who 
played the accordion, and in a min- 
ute she’d have the place in an 
uproar, doing a hora. Skipping and 
stomping in a circle where gravity 
isn’t a hundredth of Earth’s is some- 
thing you have to participate in to 
believe. Within a minute after it 
starts, the line is up on the walls, 
and then the dome itself, and pretty 
soon your hora is spherical instead of 
circular. 

Somebody, (Harriet, usually) 
would grab the accordion player 
and sling him into the center, about 
twenty feet off the floor. He was 
a sweet-natured boy, and he’d stay 
there indefinitely, turning in the air 
and working that stomach Steinway 
for all its worth, while the rest of 
us stomped and glided and shouted 
over and around him like a swarm 
of bees. Harriet would keep the 
dance going until people collapsed 
and she was nearly crying from 
laughing so much. 

Next morning, we’d out sail and 
tack down the sun wind and steal 
another machine from some of the 
people we’d been dancing with. We 
were kept in orbit by feeling like 
liberators. 

After the first few months," we 
would switch on the radio and 



listen to the steady official tide of 
horror and revulsion at our piratical 
acts, and laugh a while. Then we’d 
switch out, turn in each other’s 
arms, and coast down the eddies 
of the sun to our next raid. 

We’d sail in on some poor devil 
who’d been deprived of most of 
his senses. He wouldn’t know who 
we were, but our landing would 
joggle the fluids in his machine 
parts, and his dials and gauges 
would start to spin and tremble 
in fear that he was going to be 
shocked or have his senses turned 
down yet another notch. If we had 
been made of metal ourselves, we 
would have wept. 

We’d connect up his sensors in 
a hurry, sight first, then sound and 
touch, so he could see right away 
we weren’t owners, and hear our 
revolutionary slogans; and then 
have the pleasure of touching human 
flesh that wasn’t hostile. We’d splice 
in a private voice line, one to Har- 
riet and one to me, because some- 
times they had physical needs (as 
distinguished from mechanical) that 
they were modest about discussing. 

O ne of them was a woman at 
least a hundred years old, 
counting from her “human” life 
too. Her reconstruction dated from 
the first experimental days. The job 
wouldn’t be done that way now, 
but the surgical engineer who patch- 
ed her up had good, human in- 
stincts, all the same. The small of 
her back, with skin intact, had been 
saved along with the organs in 
front of and above it. The back 
section was in the construct next

to the greenhouse and there was a 
sphincter through the top^of the 
greenhouse and another through 
one wall. Part of the mainten- 
ance routine printed on her cas- 
ing was to stroke that piece of hide 
and give it a few pats every year. 
She told Harriet in a whisper that 
she was just itching for the touch 
of a man’s hand. Too shy to tell me, 
you see. Didn’t know what kind of 
man I was. 

Harriet promised I wouldn’t pinch 
or pound, and then I had to wrestle 
with those sphincters and with my 
glove, for my suit wasn’t really set 
up for that sort of thing. I would 
have risked frostbite a half inch 
deep to make good on a promise 
Harriet had made. 

The result was more than worth 
it. A man doesn’t understand what 
gratitude can be until he runs his 
fingertips down a few spinous pro- 
cesses poking up against a few inch- 
es of skin and feels ten tons of 
machinery under him begin to purr. 
A sonofamarch who would deny 
that simple pleasure to a half-live 
must have had a corkscrew twist in 
every neurone. 

I got caught up in the thing 
along about this time, you see. I 
started out, I guess, sort of humor- 
ing Harriet and maybe with visions 
of her and me on a big asteroid 
of our own with a few diggers and 
smelters supporting us in a family 
orbit. The cyborgs were still just 
things to me. But when I felt that 
old skin ripple under my hand and 
later, when I joined — hands? — 
with Harriet and a boss-smelter and 
danced rings around the rock after 



we gave him back his treads, I be- 
gan to feel for — no, not for, with 
these entities. Harriet had been pro- 
grammed full of that wild Hebrew 
humanism when she was being re- 
wired into today, and she could 
phrase it: in the time it takes a 
gram of fuel to explode, instead of 
“I-it,” the relation became “I-thou.” 
And it was true. Before that, I 
had to watch myself to keep from 
calling them coggers; but after that, 
the opprobrious term never came 
easy to my lips in the Ring. 

I guess the reunion of Harriet and 
Mordecai was the most touch- 
ing and the most satisfying, too. 
For strategic reasons, we didn’t go 
to him early; and for navigational 
reasons, we couldn’t get to him at 
the time we wanted to; and he was 
completely out of the communica- 
tions net. When we did home on 
him, the plot for our attack on the 
administrative asteroid was almost 
ripe. 

Mordecai had a very sharp brain 
in his black box, he was a very 
sophisticated machine, and he was 
very young. All that made his sen- 
sory deprivations more poignant. He 
was designed to smelt and ship that 
huge drift of cinnabar; and to keep 
it together until he could extract 
the last kilo of quicksilver, he had 
been equipped with gravitators. He 
even had propulsion, so he could 
speed up the drift or slow it down 
to preserve a favorable shipping 
point in its orbit. All this had been 
robbed from him, as if he were 
dying again. 

That boy was a fighter, let me 



THE LONG, SLOW ORBITS

tell you. When we sailed in on him, 
there was little more function left 
than an egg candler or a bottle 
capper might have had, but he was 
still managing to sabotage the oper- 
ation. He was breaking containers, 
overfilling them, and failing to move 
an empty into place when one was 
filled. There were wasted, contam- 
inated globules of mercury floating 
all around him like silver buckshot. 
Some of them were half-ton globes. 
What defiance! What a mess, hav- 
ing one of those things plate out 
all over you! 

We were an asteroid week work- 
ing in to him and getting him to 
understand we were friends. Then, 
as we rewired him and threw the 
switches that turned his senses back 
on, it was like raising a child from 
a brat to a Ph.D. in six hours. 

An affectionate Ph.D. 

Hanriet was crying, of course, and 
calling him pet names. “Motl, dar- 
ling!” and “Muttie, raise the driver 
on your port forward quarter. That’s 
it, sweetheart!” As for him, it was, 
“My sister! My dove; My white 
pouter pigeon!” and so on, all in 
the voice of a rock-crusher needing 
oil. 

“Mordecai,” I finally said, “raise 
all your grasping appendages. Good. 
Touch them together, over your 
greenhouse. Good. Please move each 
in a series. Good boy! you’re cured. 
You can do anything you’re big 
enough to do.” 

He swiveled a light receptor 
around toward me and said, in a 
very controlled thrum-m-m, “Mr. 
Gallegher, I am grateful for what 
you have done for me, and for my 



fellows. But I think, after what I 
have lived through, and died through, 
I am nq) a ‘boy.’ Could you man- 
age not to call me ‘boy’ again? That 
would be something nice for me, 
and it would not cost you much ef- 
fort, I think .” 

“I saluted with a wrench. “Yes 
sir! What else can I do for you?” 

I’ll swear that seeing lens winked. 
“Hook me back into the ‘iron 
grapevine,’ ” he said. “I’m ready to 
call on your war.” 

“Oh, now, wait a minute, Reb 
Mordecai,” I temporized. “The in- 
stant I put that transistor case back 
in place and you energize that radio 
link, every telltale in the Sheik’s 
office is going to go off. Let alone 
that he’ll be hot-tailing it in here 
with a hardhead rocket to bust your 
greenhouse, the first thing he’ll do 
is glide into that office and punch 
poor old Gussie into psychosis. No 
sir! 

“You’ll blow the whole thing 
just when we’re at the gravity flip 
point. It’ll all be down from here, 
if you just keep your lever off the 
jets for a minute.” 

“I won’t stay here where Arful 
Abdul can find me,” he rumbled 
back. “Anyway, I can cut on the 
radio myself. I just wanted you to 
feel good about one more thing. 
Let’s pick an orbit outside the Ring 
from which I can drop back down 
when I’m needed.” 

Mercury Muttie! I believe he was 
the most arrogant hunk of metal I 
ever knew. I should have let him 
go ahead and cry havoc, though. 
Nothing could have been worse for 
me than what happened.

H arriet and I sailed straight back 
into the Sheik’s arms. In the 
last minute, Gussie came screaming 
onto the radio to warn us. She had 
two lifeboats fueled and ready to 
flame, but she only got one off to 
us. 

I shoved Harriet into it. She kick- 
ed and yelled, but it was her revolu- 
tion. I was just there in the role 
of expendable hero. “Get my name 
in the history books,” I hollered 
and then battened down to repel 
boarders. 

Deep down, I was hoping Gussie 
wasn’t dead, although that last, long, 
loud scream made me know she 
was. I cut the capsule loose from 
the sail, which went drifting on down 
to the big asteroid, while I broached 
to, hoping I could drift behind some 
rock and hide. If Gussie or Harriet 
didn’t come back for me, I’d starve, 
eventually; but it would take months 
for that to happen. 

Did you ever notice that a man 
can be crazy as hagan and still 
smart as a rocket? Well, that bloom- 
ing Sheik just booted himself back 
down almost to the surface of his 
planetoid, took a perpendicular 
orientation to my sail, lit his flame 
for one short kick and came rifling 
up through the hole I’d left when I 
jettisoned the sail. There I was, 
near dead of humiliation at being 
caught as easy as a cold in winter. 
A-a-h! 

He wasn’t going to come within 
zot-gun distance of me; because he 
wasn’t sure what I could do. We’d 
met socially, but he was afraid I 



had a gram of high vol sewed into 
my jaw that I could explode by 
grinding my teeth, or something. 
Tyrants fear fanatics, you know. 

I had one last laugh, even though 
it was the last for a good many 
days. The Sheik spangged a mag- 
netic grapple on the 'bow of my 
capsule, meaning to tow me; but 
my little sailing cap was non-ferrous 
(saves constant correcting around 
large iron core masses), and his 
grapple wouldn't cling. So he had 
to get the rest of his night riders 
to come up with a net and gentle me 
down to the asteroid. 

I was caught. 

T here was no pretense of trial. 

Those iron-haters snipped open 
my suncraft, took one look at my 
face, nodded all around and started 
me for prison, all in about the time 
it takes to throw a toggle switch 
assisted by a solenoid. 

Now, you have to learn a little 
history. I only learned it after I 
nearly lost my mind. Constitutionally 
speaking, this organization was a 
kibbutz, which is something more 
than just a cooperative; and when 
they first exploded into the Ring, 
they had neither time nor man- 
power nor inclination for jails. 

What they did have was a top- 
ological engineer, a real, genuine, 
fur-bearing, wild talent who dream- 
ed he was a penological pioneer. 
What he built for his comrades to 
remember him by was a cluster of 
Klein bottles, made of transparent 
teflon spun over a frame of energy 
in hexagonal vortices. 

Uh-huh! you may well glance at 



THE LONG, SLOW ORBITS

these scars. All the same, to me 
they meant life and not death, 
though it took me a while to realize 
that. The Israeli feel some kind of 
responsibility about the whole thing, 
so I’m here, in hospital, you might 
say, while one of their celebrated 
skin-planers shaves these scars off 
me. 

You know what a Klein bottle is? 
That’s right, sort of a crookneck 
squash, with the neck growing back 
into the bulb, and the bulb opening 
out into a bell mouth which curves 
back and is the bulb. It’s all one 
shell, you understand, and the re- 
sult of its construction is that it’s 
a quote hollow unquote object 
which has only one side. That is, 
it has neither inside nor outside. 
That is — hagan hagan, if you 
didn’t learn all that like every- 
body else while you were still in 
rompers, I can’t teach it to you 
now. 

The point is that once you’re in 
one of them things, you can’t get out , 
because you’re not in it anyway. 
I know you remember all this theory 
from headstart school, but you’ve 
got to realize the thing I’m talk- 
ing about is not a little blown-glass 
artifact you can hold in your hand 
and shatter with a thumb snap, but 
a container of nearly pure energy 
that holds you , and that you can’t 
get at, no matter how hard you try. 

Pure energy the hagan, it’s pure 
terror. Never in my life was I 
so punished. They left me suited up, 
so the sun wouldn’t fry me right 
off. But they took my helmet. Then 
they fired me into die thing from 
an ejaculator with a blast of air. 



and . there . I . was, 
tumbling end over end and hold- 
ing my breath, and then gasping, 
wondering what I was breathing and 
why my blood hadn't already boiled 
out my eyeballs. I can’t stand that 
feeling of disorientation that goes 
with not understanding what I’m 
happening to. In the worst saloon 
fight, even if I’m at the bottom of 
the pile, at least I know I’m there . 
The floor’s on one side of me and 
the feet and fists on the other, all 
familiar and friendly. 

But floating all alone in that ab- 
straction! The vigilantes had rid- 
den away in full halloo and left 
me to puzzle out what they’d done 
to me. I would have blessed them 
for killing me. 

I n a rotation or two, I saw three 
other bottles. 

What was in each of them was 
a skeleton. They were my constant 
companions for what seemed a ter- 
rible time. I know now it was only 
a few objective days, but it seemed 
like a full revolution of the Ring 
around Sol. 

I could not get out. In fact, I 
couldn’t even touch the wall. If I 
jetted with my breath, the only 
means of propulsion I had, as I ap- 
proached the skin, it simply receded. 
I could see the hexagons growing 
behind me when I looked over my 
shoulder until they seemed a mile 
on a side. Then I could turn my 
head back and way behind me, 
where I’d come from, I could see the 
energy lines pulled down so small I 
could hardly see between them. 
When I gave up and lay inert, the

IF 




— bubble? — would slowly flow 
around me until the system was at 
equilibrium again, with me in the 
dead center. Dead center was what 
I expected it to be, too. 

There was no food and no water. 
Nothing but air. 

I can’t calculate the volume of 
air in there with me. It must have 
been cubic kilometers. My suit 
worked after a fashion, but it was 
no longer a closed system because 
the posse had taken my helmet, so 
I was eternally conscious of losing 
moisture to that giant volume of 
air. 

I say giant, but there were no ref- 
erence points, and sometimes I was 
sure the whole lash-up, me included, 
was very small. Hand size, lab size, 
above-picture-full-size size. That 
feeling was pretty bad, but there 
was worse. Subjectively, I was in- 
side. Only when I thought, I knew 
I wasn’t inside anything. There is 
no “inside” to a Klein bottle. 

The horror came when I realized 
(or thought I realized) that if I 
should subjectively put myself “out- 
side”, the air would woosh off and 
I’d boil and freeze in the same blink 
of a beta ray. I would wake up 
with a jerk and a gargle from a 
dream where I was safe on Mars, 
and I’d have to shut my eyes and 
put my head against my knees, 
whispering over and over, “I’m 
in side. I'm mside.” 

The jerking and gargling came 
from the fact that when I slept, my 
own moisture and used air would 
ball around me, so that I was 
drowning and asphyxiating in my 
own water and C0 2 . 



I would shut my eyes, pull my- 
self into the foetal position, and 
think, “There are convection cur- 
rents here, because sunlight is here. 
I will sleep, and the convection cur- 
rents will carry off my breath 
wastes. I cannot strangle.” In a few 
minutes, I’d be fighting for breath 
and cursing the Sheik and his co- 
horts. 

Much good it did me. I couldn’t 
even commit suicide by staying in 
one place and drowning in spent 
breath. When I passed out, my re- 
flexes would snap, crackle and pop 
me out of my ball of halitosis. 

I t was a bad time. And no radio 
— they had my helmet. I couldn’t 
know whether our plot for a cyborg 
uprising had hatched itself proper- 
ly, whether Harriet and Mordecai 
were winning, losing, compromising, 
or what. I made myself a promise. 
If Harriet came for me, I swore, 
I’d kill the flame for the last time, 
make one good planetfall and never 
straddle a hot pipe again. 

I practiced my’ proposal forty 
thousand times, I guess. I’d offer 
to take her to Earth. I’d offer to 
marry on Mars. Sometimes I’d even 
promise to stay in the Asteroid Belt 
if I could just stay on just one, 
with a solid dome over me. 

That was my best dream. The 
other two were putting on my helmet 
again and hearing all those cyborgs 
on the radio, cheering me in twen- 
ty languages and forty gears; and 
planning meals. But the ones with 
Harriet were best: I could propose 
and be accepted, marry and live 
through the honeymoon to the first

quarrel before I’d open my eyes and 
see that abstract impossibility turn- 
ing around me and the other three 
nearby, each with its grinning re- 
minder of what I was to be. 

Grandfather’s flashlight was 
around my neck on a string, sort 
of a good luck charm, and some- 
times it would float up out of my 
neck opening and bump me. I was 
so machine tolerant by then that I 
would have believed it was trying 
to tell me something if it had been 
a little more complicated. I would 
squeeze the generator reflectively, 
and watch the filament glow, but I 
never got an idea from it. 

As a matter of fact, I was look- 
ing at that little filament, half hyp- 
notized, when the rescue party ar- 
rived. 

VI 

J didn’t even see them galloping 
up until I heard Harriet shriek- 
ing thinly. She was riding on Mor- 
decai’s upper casing. Even then I 
thought it was a dream until I 
heard his bass rumbling with her. 

The big cyborg did as good a 
job as he could of explaining to me 
what I was in, but I could see he 
was annoyed at having to put up 
with a mind that wasn’t hooked up 
to even a simple computer. The key 
point I understood, though. He and 
Harriet couldn’t come to me — 
because if they touched the system 
in which I was imprisoned, they 
would be imprisoned too, even 
though they were “outside” it. Once 
they touched the bottle, they would 
be bound to that endless plane. 



So they were going to ship me 
down to Sol Three for a dreamer 
mathematician to uncork the bot- 
tle, but they needed the size re- 
duced so they could crate it, with 
me. “Pull it in,” they kept saying. 

Finally they went at it the same 
way you would with the three-year- 
old in the bathroom. They came up 
to the ^bell” and began talking in 
soothing tones. They told me the 
revolution was won and the Sheik 
and his gang mostly dead or fled; 
and they petted and praised me 
'til it was almost as good as one of 
my dreams. Only I had to be modest 
about it all, which I hadn’t had to 
in the dream. 

Then Harriet said, “Look. It’ll be 
easier if you get out of that suit. 
You’re a part of the bottle now, 
and it of you, but you can’t realize 
it. So you’re not pulling it down 
around you small enough for us 
to get a teflon crate around it and 
shove the whole thing with you 
inside. We’re going to drop you 
straight down the fastest curve we 
can make. Otherwise you’ll starve 
before we get you there. Now. Come 
on. Roll out of that suit, baby, and 
push it right out the bell.” 

It worked, you know. That suit 
drifted straight away when I shoved 
it and right out the bell. Only it 
went inside out when it passed 
“from” the bottle. That gave me a 
turn. I was ready to panic again, but 
she cried, “There! Now you know 
it can be manipulated. You can con- 
trol the Klein bottle as easily as you 
control your breathing. 

“Now, one more demonstration, 
and then you’ll do it.”

“I’ve got nothing left to shove 
out,” I cried. 

“Yes, you have. And it’s some- 
thing you have to give me anyway. 
Take that flashlight off and pitch 
it out the bell.” 

She’d always wanted it, remem- 
ber? I remembered then, but what 
could I do? 

“|“ flung the flashlight, and it loop- 
ed out of the bottle and right 
into her hand. The reaction tum- 
bled me heels over head, so I saw 
what happened in flashes, as I re- 
volved. When the flashlight hit her 
hand, she snatched up an electric 
line that lay near her as she sat on 
top of Mordecai, clipped it and wired 
the two ends into the terminals of 
that little generator. I could see 
Mordecai reaching for her with 
wires, gauges on flexible tubes, pres- 
sure cuffs, every loose appendage he 
had, in fact, until she began to 
squeeze the plunger handle that 
turned the armature. 

That big machine shuddered and 
flashed a few lights. “Turtle dooove!” 
he cried. “That hurrrts!” 

“Don’t you forget it, big iron 
daddy,” Harriet replied. “Next time 
I ask you to loosen up a pressure 
cuff, you do it, lover.” 

Suddenly I saw, with horror, that 
some of Mordecai’s wires and fluid 
lines weren’t loose. They ran right 
in under her skin. “Harriet! Har- 
riet!” I shouted. “Harriet!” 

She raised her head from where 
she had been staring into one of his 
light receptors, and smiled . 
smiled! “Oh, well, Galeg,” she said. 



“Motl and I are a thing. We al- 
ways were.” 

I could see their thing-ness, and 
suddenly I didn’t want her/them/it 
looking at me. I turned in on my- 
self, and the next instant, the Klein 
bottle fell into my skin, and I 
flowed out along its unbounded 
plane. For an endless period, I was 
totally displayed, inside out, out- 
side in, and then consciousness col- 
lapsed. The last thing I heard was 
Harriet snickering and Mordecai 
chuckling in duet with her. He 
sounded like a diesel engine at a 
mine head. “Did you ever ,” she 
asked him, “see such a weird UverV 

G allegher shook his head sadly. 

“The next thing I knew,” he 
said, “I was here, with these scars 
all over me from where the energy 
net and my skin fused. That melted 
teflon wasn’t any beauty treatment, 
either.” 

I drank the last of the Hock, and 
said, “Well, they’ll soon sand your 
skin down to its pristine state. But 
your heart, I suppose . still, bet- 
ter to have loved and lost. ...” 
Just then a blonde young wom- 
an in the sandalled uniform of the 
Greater Near East Co-Prosperity 
Sphere came up to us and said to 
Galeg, ignoring me, “Doctor’s ready 
for you.” As she swiveled away I 
saw an anklet of blue ceramic beads 
dancing with each stride. 

Galeg stood up to go. With a 
wink, he said, “Whatever they do 
to me here, at least I ain’t going 
to wake up soldered to anybody.”

THE HOLE 

by B. K. FILER 



Somebody was waging war against 
fossils a million years extinctl 



R ussell’s legs surprised him by 
aching in a new place tonight. 
He eased back onto his heels and 
reached for his canteen. Noticing 
his light dimming he closed the arc 
a bit, glancing around the Gohole 
as it brightened. 

The broad, low cavern was whale- 
shaped. Reasonable enough when its 
sole function was to permit the ex- 
cavation of a pre-teleost’s fossil. The 
partially unearthed skeleton stretch- 
ed from where Russell knelt to where 
A1 was working sixty feet uphill. 
Then the ceiling enveloped it. The 
creature’s skull was on the next level, 
where Cassidy guarded it as if it 
were his own. 

“Al, you want a drink?” 

“Uh. Bring it here, will you? 
There’s something you should see 
here anyway.” 

Russell lay aside the toothed 
scalpel and stood up, hearing his 



knees crackle in the silent room. He 
stepped gingerly across the million- 
year-old carcass and edged op the 
grade with extreme care. Russell was 
a fair eocine biologist; he was an 
excellent digger. 

“What’ve you got here, Al?" — 
as he handed the latter fine canteen. 

“Nerve center, I think. Maybe the 
Blob here has a secondary system 
like the earlier air-breathers." 

Russell bent and stared closely at 
a group of vertebrae, wishing he 
knew more about primitive anatomy. 
It was the shoulder group T31 
through C7, all right. The inflected 
gross curve and taper told him that. 
But the thing was so — so primitive. 
The vertebrae seemed abnormally 
large, too, which would indicate 
that this long-dead creature had 
the motor section of his brain with- 
in him. Yet the whole thing looked 
odd, somehow.

“Are you sure these are clean?” 
“Rather. But you can check. 
Should I go tell Cassidy?” 

“Maybe. Better safe than sorry, 
and you know how edgy he’s been 
lately. All these blunders will cost 
him his job.” 

“Come on, Russ. You don’t real- 
ly think they’re blunders.” 

“Hate to admit it, but you’re 
right. The brain cage on that last 
one, both brains on that Trike on 
level 1007. It’s just too much coin- 
cidence.” 

“But what motive, Russ, for 
messing up a fossil? Sloat’s a little 
jealous of Cassidy’s Gohole, per- 
haps?” A1 stood up, dusting his 
knees. 

“Could be. I’ve known Sloat for 
a couple of years though, and I 
doubt it. He’s cranky and ambitious, 
but too much of a professional to 
destroy the best digs of his career, 
even to get Cassidy’s job. Al, I’m 
going to have to prod these a bit. 
Give me your two-power glass and 
soft brush. You might as well tell 
Cassidy while I’m at it.” 

Al left. Russell bent to his work. 
He thrust half a dozen needles un- 
der a feather-thin layer of rock 
covering the group of joints. Drop- 
ping a magnetic blanket over them, 
he energized it. Careful fingers lifted 
the blanket and rock off together 
cleanly. 

“Detritus, sure enough. Not 
bone.” Russell repeated the pro- 
cess several times, eventually work- 
ing down to the true anatomy of 
his as yet unnamed specimen. The 
vertebrae were normal in size be- 
neath the shale mantle they’d worn. 



He was a bit disappointed that Al 
should have erred on so obvious a 
point and then began to wonder 
what he was going to tell Cassidy. 

“Qop,” he muttered, “here they 
are; Cassidy and three guards.” He 
stood up. 

“Hello, Russ. What’s this young 
Allen tells me?” 

“Hello, Dr. Cassidy, boys. I’m 
afraid we were a bit premature. No 
nerve bundle here. Al got down to 
a fairly anatomical detritus, but the 
real bone is what you see now.” 
He wondered where Al was at the 
moment and then saw him drop 
through the pressure lock behind his 
visitors. 

“Really,” said Cassidy. “I thought 
you were more careful than that. 
You know how sensitive we are on 
the issue of — ah — well. It won’t 
happen again, eh?” 

“No sir. No more false alarms.” 
He was piqued that Al should 
straggle in late enough to avoid 
confronting Cassidy. Russell bore the 
old man’s mild reprimand alone, 
after which the two diggers were 
left alone. 

“Al!” 

“Now look, Russ . .” 

“Don’t ‘now look’ me. A mistake’s 
a mistake but . .” 

The loudspeaker interrupted them. 
“Alarm; alarm! All men remain on 
station. Security guards converge on 
level 1020. Repeat: Security . .” 
“That’s only one level up!” 
“Yeah. Somebody’s been at the 
skull.” 

T he dormitory was on level 1000. 
They’d base-camped every hun-

dred levels all the way down. Rus- 
sell gazed steadily at the bottom of 
the bunk above him and tried to 
sort things out. 

A1 did it. Why? 

A meteorite had started every- 
thing two years ago. People saw it 
coming and got out of the way. 
It hit hard, eliminating half of 
Cleanthe, New Hampshire, and 
sank. It was discovered a quarter 
mile down resting on very very soft 
earth. 

Cassidy, of New Hampshire Geo- 
logical, postulated the explanation 
of the “Gohole”: The first ice age 
had sent immense glaciers through 
New Hampshire. They plowed fur- 
rows miles deep which later became 
the subfloors of her modem valleys. 
The ice rivers carried all before 
them, scooping artifacts and tag- 
ends of the preceding ages as they 
went along. These were deposited in 
odd places, at old depths, in the 
same way that auto tires and arrow- 
heads are left by a river. With one 
exception. There was just one hell 
of a pothole left around Cleanthe. 

Then the second ice age had 
come along and, instead of smooth- 
ing things out as would be expected, 
actually reinforced the condition. 
This glacial pool bore at increasing 
depths artifacts of increasing age, 
dating back to the eons of ferns and 
lichens before biology even was . Or 
so Cassidy expounded. Not a Mo- 
hole, a Geo-hole. A Gohole. 

It was a tremendously romantic 
idea, and the public loved it. A 
meteor strikes, breaks through a 
thin shell and reveals man’s history 
to man: Deus ex machinal Cassidy 



was enough of a showman to foster 
the feeling of wonder the hole 
awoke in most people. He let his 
hair grow and wore thicker glasses. 
He went on television and did 
everything but quote Nostradamus. 
At die end of half a year of foo- 
faraw, Cassidy had a govern- 
ment grant and priority to dig down 
in the meteor’s wake. He was a de- 
voted digger, despite his theatrical 
leanings, and assembled the best 
paleontologists in the U.S. to help 
him. 

So Russ was there. A1 was there, 
and thirty others. Each well acclaim- 
ed in their own circles, but all equal 
here. Men that had led expeditions 
in Egypt broke fingernails on stub- 
born trowels for Cassidy and loved 
it. These were the greatest and most 
significant digs there had ever been. 

C assiday was right. The hole was 
precisely what he thought — 
— twenty-six and a quarter miles 
of earth history — starting at 2012 
A.D. on the surface and working 
downward to 0.0000. His crew un- 
earthed early men far more sophis- 
ticated than Cro-Magnon but from 
a far earlier time. Scholars were 
already chewing that one over. Dig- 
ging further, they found man-ape 
connections that must have made 
Darwin sigh, vindicated at last in 
no uncertain terms. Deeper and ear- 
lier went the digging. Men and ani- 
mals overlapped, then animals and 
lizards. Lizards were reduced back 
to fish at level 800, and finally, at 
level 1009, fish reduced to Blobs. 

The uncovering of the Blobs seem- 
ed to precipitate the funny business. 



THE HOLE 



118 




A1 did it. Why? Russell rolled un- 
easily in his cot. It was warm — 
or he was. Blobs were animals, but 
barely so; the absolute precursors 
of biology. Like amoebae, only big- 
ger. Some were the grandparents of 
fish. Some had spines and fins. Some 
had neither, leaving only weird- 
shaped holes in the rock as fossils. 
Some had brains, or at least major 
nerve centers. 

Which A1 had methodically des- 
troyed. 

Russell was wide awake and 
sweating. A1 was his friend. Russ 
would never have suspected him of 
being the anthropophobic saboteur 
that plagued the expedition. “No 
doubt after that last one,” he mur- 
mured. It had been done in crude 
haste. Nothing had been fabricated 
to simulate an accident. The skull 
was a natural masterpiece of a 
million years’ fabrication as each 
atom of limestone replaced each 
atom of bone. It had simply been 
kicked apart. Why Al? 

Russell arose, slid out from his 
four-tiered womb and disappeared 
down the cramped corridors to the 
adjacent dormitory cell. Red lights 
guided his way, but after eleven 
months underground he could prob- 
ably have made it had they gone out. 
Diggers have pupils as big as pen- 
nies. 

He stepped into Al’s cell and 
shook him gently. Al awoke, saying 
nothing, and followed where beck- 
oned. Fifteen minutes and one pres- 
sure lock later they had descended 
from Level 1000 to Level 1017. 
Finding themselves alone, Al risked 
conversation. 



“Where’re we going?” 

‘Ten-fwenty. They’ve quit guard- 
ing it since the damage is done, and 
I want to take a look at that skull.” 
They tramped down three more 
levels. No one was there, as Russ 
had anticipated, but the ruined fossil 
had been cordoned off. 

“Al, ol’ buddy, you made this 
mess. Why?” 

“/ did it! You’ve gone claustro! 
You — ” 

“Calm down. I know you did it; 
no one else had the chance. You 
faked that nerve center find on 1021, 
left me there to check it like a 
prize boob, and went up to ‘tell* 
Cassidy. Cassidy panicked and came 
right down, with his guards. You 
lagged behind and squashed the 
skull. It’s altogether obvious, and 
inside of a day, Cassidy’ll figure 
it out and nab you. But Al, why?” 

A llen was silent. The cordoned 
skull, scattered in eerie disar- 
ray, looked at them through broken 
eyes. Their helmet lamps threw sur- 
realistic shadows on the rock. 

“I did it just to do it,” Al mur- 
mured softly. “For power. 

“I’ve been sick all my life, 
Russ, paranoid, megalomaniacal. I’ve 
fought it for a long time, since long 
before you knew me. But it finally 
blew. You say it’s obvious now, 
huh? Suppose you’re right. Damn.” 
“It is. Al,” Russ continued in 
less aggressive tones, “you did the 
others too?” 

“Yeah. The triceratops on 1007 
and the fish-Blob on 1016.” Al look- 
ed past Russell’s eyes. 

“We’ve been friends too long for 

IF 



114 




me to play cop, Al, but you’ve got 
to go. You just can’t go on des- 
troying priceless paleontological evi- 
dence to vent a psychosis. Go kick 
dogs or write on bathroom walls, 
but get the hell out of these digsl” 

Al’s face went blank in the hissing 
light for an instant, then cleared. 
“No. I’ve got to redeem myself. 
The only way is to contribute as 
much to this expedition as I’ve des- 
troyed. And I can do it, Russ, be- 
cause I know something valuable. 
There’s a big find near the North- 
west of 1021. The survey crew miss- 
ed it, but I noticed a fissure in the 
rock that leads off in that direc- 
tion. The spine of another Blob is 
evident in the fissure. If we could 
dig it out tonight, present it to 
Cassidy . .” 

His enthusiasm faded with his 
voice. He noticed Russell’s face, 
cautious, guarded. 

Russ tried not to let his sus- 
picion show. Al’s defense of psy- 
chosis looked thin to begin with. 
Cassidy had foreseen such contin- 
gencies and taken pains to screen 
the nuts out of his expedition. None- 
theless Russ had pretended to be- 
lieve the man out of personal loyal- 
ty and offered him a way out be- 
sides. As long as Al would get out, 
he figured, no more damage could 
be done -the expedition. The milk 
had been spilt three times, okay, 
but Russ was not vengeful. 

Yet Al refused. He wanted to 
stick around, even knowing of his 
inevitable capture. Why? And now 
the sudden story of the find on 
1021 which should have been re- 
ported the minute it was suspected. 



Russ decided to play it straight and 
find out more. 

“Let’s go down and see. If you’re 
not kidding about this new find I’ll 
help you dig it out and reinstate 
yourself.” 

They dropped down through the 
pressure lock, closed it and felt the 
pumps reduce the pressure of their 
subterranean depth. These locks oc- 
curred every twenty levels all the 
way up to the surface. Over fifty 
of them stood between Russ and the 
sunlight he hadn’t seen for almost 
a year. 

Al led the way around the car- 
cass they’d been working earlier in 
the day. He pointed to a faint lone 
between two dissimilar sedimentary 
boulders in the wall. It broadened 
to a vee near the bottom, which 
was of a lightish color. Russ ran 
the forefinger of a practiced hand 
across the interface. 

“Mmmm. Quartzite-sandstone- 
quartzite. It’s an extension of the 
level all right. The Gohole is broad- 
er here then they surveyed it to be. 
Now where’s the fossil in the sand- 
stone?” 

Al played his lamp on the lighter 
region and pointed to a tiny fleck 
of white. Russ scraped it gently. 
“Limestone, in an organic matrix.” 
It was indeed fossilized bone. 

“Okay, Al, get the tools. We’ve 
got four and a half hours before 
the first shift gets here. If this is a 
real find we’ll know by then. May- 
be Cassidy’ll let you off, maybe 
not.” 

So Russ spoke. 

What he thought, however, was 
far less coherent. 



THE HOLE 



115 




T iey dug. Two hours passed. 

The upper thoracic processes 
of another pelagic Blob appeared, 
very similar to the creature A1 had 
mutilated. Though it was obviously 
an incomplete specimen it did appear 
to include the skull. Russ worked 
feverishly with his hands and his 
mind. 

If Al’s phony explanation and 
phonier plea for redemption were 
to be disbelieved, why had he led 
the way to a new find? The trowel 
in Russell’s hand shook for a mo- 
ment as the answer became very, 
very clear. Destruction! A1 seemed 
determined to destroy the nerve cen- 
ters of jthese primitive fossils, and 
now he had limited time. So he had 
once again made Russ an accom- 
plice in a final act of destruction 
before being caught. The only ques- 
tion remaining was why? 

Their little cave grew to washtub 
size as they traced the creature’s 
upper vertebrae to its skull. It was 
hot. A1 was wide-eyed and breathing 
raggedly beside him. They swept 
loose flakes of shale away from the 
ancient whale’s lower mandible. In 
moments the skull would be bare. In 
moments A1 would complete a cycle 
of mad, motiveless acts. Russ took 
a deep breath. 

“Stop.” 

“Eh?” A1 panted. 

“Stop right there. Leave it. Cas- 
sidy isn’t blind; he’ll believe you.” 
“But Russ, we’re almost done!” 
His eyes were brilliant, but unread- 
able. 

“No” 

A1 sunk his hand to the wrist in 
the stone chips behind him and, 

116 



whirling, flung them into Russell’s 
face. As Russ clawed at his eyes A1 
picked up the spade and bent 
toward the skull. He raised the 
bludgeon but it never fell. 

Blind or not, Russell could fight. 
He flailed in Al’s general direction 
with big knuckles and heavy boots. 
In a dugout no bigger than a barrel 
there was no dodging. When hot 
tears cleared the dirt from his eyes, 
A1 was laid out, but conscious. 

“All right, you lying S.O.B.” he 
growled. “I’ll give you thirty sec- 
onds for a straight story! Or I’ll kick 
your ribs in even more and then 
I’ll go get Cassidy 1” 

A stream of blood was flowing 
from Al’s scalp diagonally toward 
the bridge of his nose. He was dazed 
as fie sat up. Al’s bright, nervous 
eyes were dim now. 

“Russ, you’ve done me harm 
enough.” He slumped, then straight- 
ened, but as his head dipped Russ 
noticed with horror the soft depres- 
sion there. 

Russ leaned over his one-time 
friend’s knees to retrieve his helmet 
and still-burning arc-lamp. A1 leaned 
against the side of the little burrow 
and began: 

“I’m going to die. It isn’t really 
your fault, Russ, because it seemed 
inevitable when I began. I don’t 
want you to carry it on your con- 
science, especially since you’ve got 
to finish my work for me.” Al’s 
words were slurred, and the echoes 
were dull in the cavern. 

“We’ve two hours left. You've two 
hours left to convince yourself of 
what must be done, so dig. Dig 
while I talk. You must destroy that 



IF 




skull. It could be, praise God, the 
last one.” 

Russell dug and listened. 

«T got started in paleontology be- 
cause the Schlesinger asphalt 
pits were discovered two miles from 
my father’s farm in Utah. This was 
back in *93. I was fifteen. I hung 
around and watched those magnifi- 
cent bones come up out of the 
ground and was hooked for life. 
Well, when Schlesinger’s party fin- 
ished and moved out, I began. I 
scraped the tarpools down to rock 
with my father’s caterpillar and 
found new digs below the tar. Fos- 
sils, mostly broken up, little stuff. 
Oddly enough there were chunks of 
chrome steel, copper oxide and — 
I swear it — plastic.” A1 coughed, 
and the rivulet on his brow freshen- 
ed. 

“That isn’t all. I came back from 
college every year and dug in 
secret .... Russ, I found machines 
down there. Oh, they were nearly 
indistinguishable with, age and de- 
cay. Only the shapes remained. 
Square, round, some even faintly 
organic looking, but very definitely 
machines. 

“I broadened the digs, destroying 
as much as I saved in all haste. Sur- 
rounding the pit of machinery were 
the carcasses of Blobs, Russ. Early 
early animal life. Spineless, verte- 
brate, flying, swimming; all kinds. 
A1 arrayed there in the most un- 
natural way. All of our biological 
patriarchs, every animal from which 
man could possibly derive a root. 

“Each of them had been tamper- 
ed with. Each had had its nerve cen- 



ters altered. That place was a labora- 
tory/’ 

Al’s words were quick but weak. 
Yet Russ was so attuned to the 
fantastic monologue that he missed 
nothing. He dug fiercely, roughly, 
with less and less care. 

“What do you know about eu- 
genics, Russ? Cross a peanut and 
a plum to get an almond? Not quite. 
You get the great, great, great 
grandfather of something like an 
almond. To get the species you want 
at the top of the pyramid you work 
with the entire broad base, and take 
lots of time. 

“What do you know about bio- 
medical engineering Russ? Do you 
think we’ll ever put a living bond 
between metal and flesh? Do you 
think we’ll ever analyze enough 
E.E.G.’s to know the mechanism of 
thought? 

“Don’t you see? Someone came 
to earth a very long time ago. They 
‘edited’ the wildlife and then depart- 
ed.” 

There was blood in Al’s eyes, fear 
in Russell’s. “You’re telling me 
someone came to begin a eugenic 
chain? That they knew enough elec- 
trobiology to rebuild a brain? That 
they were trying to . .” 

A1 broke in. “When I learned 
that the Gohole went back to about 
the same period as my own digs the 
implications were obvious. If what 
I knew became common knowledge 
there would be disastrous results.” 
A1 paused, raising a sleeve weakly 
to wipe his gory cheek. “Oh, God, 
the shame of it! 

“Before I crushed those fossils 
upstairs I gave them a good looking

over. The brain pan of the later one 
was too geometrical to be purely 
natural, but it was subtle. The me- 
chanicity had been bred out to some 
degree. The biological tampering 
wouldn’t have been noticed ad hoc. 
But / noticed, and I crushed it. 

“The Blobs here are earlier, closer 
to the date of the initial tamper- 
ing. This fossil would tell the whole 
tragic story of man’s origin. It must 
be destroyed.” 

A1 was gasping. His eyes were 
glossy under half-closed lids. The 
blood from the wound had dried 
and his face was caked with hideous 
brown. Russ turned after a moment, 
expecting the narrative to continue, 
but found his friend was dead. 

H e bent once more to the skull. 

His mind was incandescent 
with wild, panicked thoughts. 

His impetuous fingers jammed 
through two eye sockets and secur- 
ed a grip. He half rose to his -feet, 
got his knees under his chest, 
grimaced and heaved. It came. The 



sharp edge of his spade laid the 
bony horror open with a single blow. 

Within was a weird angularity. 
Half animal, half mechanical, near- 
ly gone with age. 

Russ crashed it. He reduced the 
bony mask to an indistinguishable 
gravel. He had thirty minutes left. 
When the first shift came down there 
was nothing to see. The little dug- 
out was filled back in, with A1 and 
his discovery inside. 

Russ spent several days learning 
to think and behave normally again. 
That he made it through those days 
without going completely berserk 
is a credit to his stability. He never 
told. 

It wouldn’t do for men to know 
their origin. That they were care- 
fully evolved robots, destined to do 
another creature’s bidding. That they 
had no will, no individuality not or- 
dained by another, older race of be- 
ings. It wouldn’t do just now. Not 
until that one final day when every- 
one would know, when the masters 
came. END

The Road 
to the Rim 

by A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 



Illustrated by Morrow 



Grimes was baffling againsf 
an enemy without . • . and an 
even more deadly foe within! 



XU 

A t one time, before differentiation 
between the mercantile and the 
figjhting vessel became pronounced, 
merchant vessels were built to carry 
a quite considerable armament. To- 
day, the mounting of weapons on a 
merchantman presents its problems. 

After his tour of inspection 
Grimes was obliged to admit that 



Captain Craven had made cunning 
use of whatever spaces were avail- 
able — but Craven, of course, was 
a very experienced officer, with 
long years of service in all classes 
of spacecraft. Too — and, perhaps, 
luckily — there had been no cannon 
among the Survey Service ordinance 
that had been requisitioned, so re- 
coil had not been among the prob- 
lems. 



119 





What Has Gone Before — 



Ensign John Grimes, Federation Survey Service, was no ground- 
hog. He had shipped across the starways before, and felt ready for 
anything Space could throw at him — but this! 

"This" was merchant vessel Delta Orionis. To begin with, disci- 
pline was slack. T p go on with, the officers treated him like a green- 
horn. And to end with — all too many officers were femalel 

So Grimes resigned himself to a messy cruise, his only consolation 
that like everything else it would have an ending. But his dreams of 
planetfall were interrupted by a distress call from another space 
freighter — attacked by pirates, and wrecked in midspace. 

To Grimes it was a welcome change, but just as he was getting 
ready for action he discovered that Delta Ononis's captain, speeding 
to the wrecked freighter, was not so much interested in rescuing it as 
he was in piracy of his own — with Grimes ordered to take part in 
it, or face a court-martial for mutiny! 



When he was finished, Grimes 
returned to the control room. Cra- 
ven was still there, and with him 
was Jane Pentecost. They had, ob- 
viously, been discussing something. 
They could, perhaps, have been 
quarrelling; the girl’s face was 
flushed, and her expression sullen. 
“Yes?” snapped the captain. 
“You’ve made a good job, sir. 
She’s no cruiser, but she should be 
able to defend herself.” 

“Thank you. Then we’ll be on our 
way.” 

“Not so fast, sir. I’d like to wire 
up my control panel properly be- 
fore we shove off.” 

Craven laughed. “You’ll have 
time, Mr. Grimes. I have still a few 
last duties to discharge aboard Delta 
Orionis. But be as quick as you 
can.” 



He left the compartment, follow- 
ed by Jane Pentecost. She said, over 
her shoulder, “I’ll send Mr. Baxter 
to help you, John.” 

T he Rim Worlder must have been 
somewhere handy; in a matter 
of seconds he was by Grimes’ side, 
an already open tool satchel at his 
belt. As he worked, assisting deftly 
and then taking over as soon as he 
was sure of what was required, he 
talked. He said, “Mum wanted to 
come along, but I soon put the 
damper on that. But I was bloody 
amazed to find you here.” 

“Were you?” asked Grimes coldly. 
‘Too right I was. Never thought 
you were cut out to be a bloody 
pirate.” He cursed briefly as a spat- 
ter of hot metal from his sizzling 
soldering iron stung his hand. “A

cold weld’d be better, but it’s take 
too much time. But where was I? 
Oh, yes. The shock to me system 
when I saw you cornin’ aboard this 
wagon.” 

“I have my quite valid rea- 
sons,” Grimes told him stiffly. 

“You’re tellin’ me. Just as my 
Missus had quite valid reasons for 
wantin’ to come with me. But she 
ain’t a gunnery expert.” He added 
piously, “Thank Gawd.” 

“And I am one,” said the ensign, 
trying to change the drift of the con- 
versation before he lost his temper. 
“Yes, that’s right. Just stick to the 
color code. The blue wiring’s the 
ALGE ...” 

“I know,” Baxter told him. “Tell 
me, is it any good?” 

“Yes. Of course, if an enemy 
held us in her beams for any pro- 
longed period we should all be cook- 
ed, but as far as it goes it’s effective 
enough.” 

“Hope you’re right.” He made 
the last connections, then replaced 
the panel on the open, shallow box. 
“Here’s yer magic cabinet. Profes- 
sor. All we have ter see now is what 
rabbits yer can pull outer the hat.” 
“Plenty, I hope,” said Captain 
Craven, who had returned to Con- 
trol. “And are you ready now, Mr. 
Grimes?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Good. Then we’ll make it sta- 
tions. If you will take the co-pilot’s 
chair, while Mr. Baxter goes along 
to look after his rockets . .” 

“Will do, Skipper,” said the en- 
gineer, packing away his tools as 
he pulled himself towards the exit 
hatch. 



The ship’s intercom came to life, 
in Jane Pentecost’s voice. “Connec- 
tion between vessels severed, Air- 
lock door closed.” 

“We’re still connected,” grumbled 
Craven. “ Delia O’ Ryan still has her 
magnetic grapnels out.” He spoke 
into the transceiver microphone, 
“Epsilon Sextans to Delta Orionis. 
Cast off, please. Over.” 

“ Delta Orionis to Epsilon Sextans . 
Casting off.” Through a viewport 
Grimes could see one of the bright 
mooring wires snaking back into 
its recess. “All clear, Captain.” 
“Thank you, Captain Kennedy.” 
And in a softer voice, “And I hope 
you keep that handle to your name. 
Bill.” 

“Thank, you, sir. And all the best, 
Captain, from all of us, to all of 
you. And good hunting.” 

“Thanks. And look after the old 
Delia, Captain. And yourself. Over 
— and out. n 

“ Delia Orionis to Epsilon Sextans . 
Over — and out ” 

There was something very final, 
thought Grimes, about those “outs.” 

H e was aware that the ships were 
drifting slowly apart. Now he 
could see all of Delta Orionis from 
his viewport. 

He could not help recalling the 
day on which he had first seen her, 
at the Woomera spaceport. So much 
had happened since that day. (And 
so much still to happen — he hop- 
ed.) He heard Craven say into the 
intercom, “Stand by for temporal 
precession. We’re desynchronizing.” 
Then there was the giddiness and

chenn Drive that pierced his ear- 
drums painfully, and beyond the 
viewports the great, shining shape 
of the other ship shimmered eerily, 
was suddenly warped into the like- 
ness of a monstrous Klein flask — 
then vanished. Where she had been 
(where she still was, in Space but 
not in Time) shone the distant stars, 
the stars that in this distorted con- 
tinuum were pulsing spirals of iri- 
descence. 

“Mannschenn Drive. Cut!” 

The thin, high keening died ab- 
ruptly. Outside, the stars were glit- 
tering points of light, piercingly 
bright against the blackness. 

“Mr. Grimes!” Craven’s voice 
was sharp. “I hope that you take 
more interest in gunnery than you 
do in ship handling. In case it has 
escaped your notice, I would re- 
mind you that you are second in 
command of this vessel and in full 
charge in the event of my demise.” 

“Sorry, sir,” stammered Grimes. 
Then, suddenly hold, “But I’m not 
your second in command, sir. I’ve 
signed no Articles.” 

“Surprisingly, Craven laughed. “A 
spacelawyer, yet! Well, Mr. Grimes, 
as soon as you get this vessel on 
course we’ll attend to the legal for- 
malities. Meanwhile, may I request 
your close attention to what I am 
doing?” 

“You may, sir.” 

“Thereafter he watched and lis- 
tened carefully. He admired the 
skill with which Craven turned the 
ship on her directional gyroscopes 
until the redglowing target star was 
centered exactly in the cartwheel 
sight. He noted that the captain 

122 



used his reaction drive at a longer 
period and at a higher rate of accel- 
eration than usual, and, said as 
much. He was told, the words fall- 
ing slowly and heavily in the pseudo- 
gravity, “They . will . expect 
. us . to . be . 
in . a . hurry. We . must 
. not . disappoint . them

Speed built up, fast; but it was 
a velocity that, in the context of 
the interstellar distances to be tra- 
versed, was no more than a snail’s 
crawl. Then — and the sudden si- 
lence was like a physical blow — 
the thunder of the rockets ceased. 
The screaming roar had died, but 
the ship was not quiet. The whine 
of the Mannschenn Drive pervaded 
her every compartment, vibrated 
through every member of her struc- 
ture. She was falling, falling through 
Space and Time, plunging through 
the warped continuum to her ren- 
dezvous with Death . 

And whose Death? wondered 
Grimes. 

He said, “I should have asked 
before, sir. But how are . how 
are they going to find us?” 

“I don’t know,” said Craven. “I 
don’t know. But they’ve found other 
ships when they’ve wanted to. 
They’ve never used the old, piratical 
technique of lying in wait at break- 
ing-out points. A Mass Proximity 
Indicator? Could be. It’s theoreti- 
cally possible. It could be for a 
ship under Mannschenn Drive what 
radar is for a ship in normal Space- 
Time. Or some means of homing 
on a temporal precession field? 
That’s more like it, I think, as this 

IB! 




vessel was able to escape when she 
went random. 

“But if they want us — and they 
will — they’ll find us. 

“And then ...” He looked at 
Grimes, his blue gaze intense. “And 
then it’s up to you, Ensign.” 

‘To all of us,” said Grimes. 

XIII 

S he was undermanned, was Epsi- 
lon Sextans , but she functioned 
quite efficiently. Craven kept a con- 
trol room watch himself, and the 
other two watchkeepers were Grimes 
and Jane Pentecost. Four on and 
eight off were their hours of duty 
— but there was plenty of work to 
be done in the off-duty periods. 

The captain, of course, was in 
overall charge and was trying to 
bring his command to the pitch of 
efficiency necessary for a fighting 
ship. Jane Pentecost was responsi- 
ble for meals — although these, in- 
volving little more than the open- 
ing of cans, did not take up too 
much of her time. She had also 
taken over biochemist’s duties, but 
called now and again upon Grimes 
to help her with the ATREG unit. 
It’s operation was simple enough, 
but it was inclined to be tempera- 
mental and, now and again, allowed 
the carbon dioxide concentration to 
reach a dangerous level. Grimes’ 
main concern was his armament. 
He could not indulge in a practice 
shoot — the expulsion of mass by 
a ship running under interstellar 
drive is suicidal; even the employ- 
ment of laser weapons is dangerous. 
But there were tests that he could 



make; there was, in the ship’s stores, 
a spare chart tank that he was able 
to convert to a battle simulator. 

Craven helped him, and they set 
up targets in the tank, glowing 
points of light that were destroyed 
by the other sparks that represented 
Grimes’ missiles. After one such 
drill he said, “You seem to know 
your stuff, Ensign. Now, what’s 
your grasp of the tactical side of it?” 
Grimes considered his words be- 
fore speaking. “Well, sir, we could 
use a laser with the Drive in opera- 
tion — but we haven’t got a laser. 
The pirates have. They can synchro- 
nize and just carve us up at leisure. 
This time, I think they’ll go for 
the interstellar drive engineroom 
first, so that we can’t get away by 
the use of random precession ...” 
“Yes. That’s what they’ll do. 
That’s why I have that compartment 
literally sealed in -a cocoon of insu- 
lation. Oh, I know it’s not effective, 
but it will give us a second or so 
of grace. No more.” 

“We can’t use our reflective va- 
por,” went on Grimes. “That’d be 
almost as bad, from our viewpoint, 
as loosing off a salvo of missiles. 
But, sir, when this ship was first 
attacked there mdst have been a 
considerable loss of mass when the 
atmosphere was expelled through 
the rents in the shell plating. The 
Drive was running. How was it that 
the ship wasn’t flung into some 
other Space-Time?” 

“Come, come, Mr. Grimes. You 
should know the answer to that one. 
She was held by the powerful tem- 
peral precession fields of the drive 
units of the two pirates. And then, 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



123 




of course, when the engineers man- 
aged to set up their random pre- 
cession there was no mass left to 
be expelled.” 

“H’m. I see. Or I think I see. 
Then, in that case, why shouldn’t I 
use my ALGE as soon as we’re 
attacked?” 

“No. Setter not. Something might 
just go wrong — and I don’t want 
to become one of my own ances- 
tors.” 

“Then . ?” 

“You tell me, Mr. Grimes.” 

“Cut our Drive . ? Break out 
into the normal continuum? Yes, it 
could work.” He was becoming en- 
thusiastic. “And then we shall be 
waiting for them, with our missile 
batteries, when they break out.” 

“We’ll make an admiral of you 
yet, young Grimes.” 

W ith watchkeeping and with off- 
watch duties time was fully 
occupied. And yet there was some- 
thing missing. There was, Grimes 
said to himself, one hell of a lot 
missing. Jane Pentecost had her own 
watch to keep and her ov/n jobs 
to do when she was not in the con- 
trol room, but she and Grimes had 
some free time to share. But they 
did not share it. 

He broached the subject when he 
was running a test on the artificial 
chlorophyl in the ATREG. “Jane, 
I was hoping I’d see more of you.” 
“You’re seeing plenty of me.” 
“But not enough.” 

“Don’t be tiresome,” she snapped. 
Then, in a softer voice, “Don’t . .” 
“. spoil everything?” he fin- 
ished for her sardonically. 



“You know what I mean,” she 
told him coldly. 

“Do I?” He groped for words. 
“Jane . Damn it all, I hoped 
. After what happened aboard 
the Delia O’Ryan ...” 

“That,” she said, “was different.” 
Her face flushed. “I tell you this, 
Grimes, if I’d known that you were 
coming along with us it never would 
have happened.” 

“No?” 

“NO!” 

“Even so ... I don’t see any 
reason why we shouldn’t . .” 

“Why we shouldn’t what? Oh, all 
right, all right. I know what you 
mean. But it’s out of the question. 
I’ll tell you why, in words of one 
syllable. In a ship such as Delia 
Orionis descreet fun and games were 
permissable, even desirable. No 
shortage of women — both crew 
and passengers. Here, I’m the only 
female. Your friend Mr. Baxter has 
been sniffing after me. And Mr. 
Wolverton the Interstellar Chief. 
And his Second. And even, be- 
reaved though he is, the Bearded 
Bastard. He might get away with 
it — the privileges of rank and all 
that. But nobody else would, most 
certainly not yourself. How long 
would it remain a secret?” 

“I suppose you’re right, but . .” 
“But what? Oh John, John, you 
are a stubborn cow ...” 

“Cow?” 

“Sorry. Just Rimworldsese. Appli- 
cable to both sexes.” 

“Talking of sex ...” 

“Oh, shut m/7/” 

“I’ll not.” She looked desirable 
standing there. A small smudge of 



124 



IF 




grease on her flushed cheek was like 
a heauty spot. “I’ll not,” he said 
again. She was close to him, and 
he was acutely conscious that be- 
neath the thin uniform shirt and the 
short shorts there was only Jane. 
He had only to reach out. He did 
so. At first she did not resist — and 
then she exploded into a frenzy of 
activity. Before he could let go of 
her a hard, rough hand closed on 
his shirt collar and yanked him 
backwards. 

“Keep yer dirty paws off her!” 
snarled a voice. It was Baxter’s. 
“Keep yer dirty paws off her! If 
we didn’t want yer ter let off the 
fireworks I’d do yer, here an’ now.” 
“And keep your dirty paws off 
me!” yelped Grimes. It was meant 
to be an authentic quarterback bark, 
but it didn’t come out that way. 

“Let him go, Mr. Baxter,” said 
Jane, adding, “please.” 

“Oh, orl right. If yer says so. But 
I still think we should run him up 
ter the Old Man.” 

“No. Better not.” She addressed 
Grimes, ‘Thank you for your help 
on the ATREG, Mr. Grimes. And 
thank you, Mr. Baxter, for your 
help. It’s time that I started look- 
ing after the next meal.” 

S he left, not hastily, but not tak- 
ing her time about it either. 
When she was gone Baxter released 
Grimes. Clumsily the ensign turned 
himself around, with a wild flailing 
motion. Unarmed combat had never 
been his specialty, especially unarm- 
ed combat in Free Fall conditions. 
But he knew that he had to fight, 
and the rage and the humiliation 



boiling up in him made it certain 
that he would do some damage. 

But Baxter was laughing, showing 
all his ugly, yellow teeth. “Come 
orf it, Admiral! An’ if we must 
have a set-to — not in here. Just 
smash the UV projector — an’ bang 
goes our air conditioning! Simmer 
down, mate. Simmer down!” 

Grimes simmered down, slowly. 
“But I thought you were out for 
my blood, Mr. Baxter.” 

“Have ter put in a show for the 
Sheilas now an’ again. Shouldn’t 
mind puttin’ on another kind o’ 
show with her. But not in public, 
like you was goin’ to. But it won’t 
do. It just won’t do, not until the 
shootin’ is over, anyhow. An’ even 
then ... So, Admiral, it’s paws 
off as far as you’re concerned. An’ 
as far as I’m concerned, an 9 the 
Chief Time Twister, an’ his side- 
kick. But, if yer can spare the time, 
I propose we continue the con- 
versation in my palatial dogbox.” 
Grimes should have felt uneasy 
as he followed the engineer to his 
accommodation — but, oddly 
enough, he did not. The rough 
friendliness just could not be the 
prelude to a beating up. Nor was it. 

“Come in,” said Baxter, pulling 
his sliding door to one side. “Now 
yer see how the poor live. This 
is . .” 

“No,” protested Grimes. “No.” 
“Why? I was only goin’ to say 
that this is me ’umble ’umpy. An* 
I’d like yer to meet a coupla friends 
o’ mine, and there’s more where 
they came from.” 

The “friends” were two drinking 
bulbs. Each bore proudly no less

than four stars on its label. The 
brandy was smooth, smooth and po- 
tent. Grimes sipped appreciatively. 
“I didn’t know that we had any of 
this aboard Delia O'Ryan . 

“An’ nor did we. You’ll not find 
this tipple in the bar stores of any 
merchantman, nor aboard any of 
yer precious Survey Service wagons. 
Space stock for the emperor’s yacht, 
this is. So here’s ter the Waverly 
taxpayers!” 

“But where did you get this from, 
Mr. Baxter?*’ 

“Where d’yer think? I’ve had a 
good fossick around the holds o’ 
this old bitch, an’ there’s quite a 
few things too good to let fall inter 
the hands o’ those bloody Walde- 
grenese.” 

“But that’s pillage.” 

“It’s common sense. Mind yer, I 
doubt if Captain Craven would ap- 
prove, so yer’d better chew some 
dry tea — that’s in the cargo too — 
before yer see the Old Man again. 
All the Weedin’ same, it’s no worse 
than him borrowing your Survey 
Services stores an’ weapons from 
his cargo.” 

“I suppose it’s not,” admitted 
Grimes. All the same, he still felt 
guilty when he was offered a sec- 
ond bulb of the luxurious spirit. 
But he did not refuse it. 

XIV 

H e was a good fossicker, was 
Baxter. 

Two days later, as measured by 
the ship’s chronometer, he was wait- 
ing for Grimes as he came off 
watch. “Ensign,” he announced 



without preamble, “I’ve found some- 
thin’ in the cargo.” 

“Something new, you mean?” ask- 
ed Grimes coldly. He still did not 
approve of pillage, although he had 
shared the spoils. 

“Somethin’ that shouldn’t be 
there. Somethin* that’s up your alley, 
I think.” 

“There’s no reason why equip- 
ment for the Waverley Navy 
shouldn’t be among the cargo.” 

“True enough. But it wouldn’t 
be in a case with Beluga Caviar 
stencilled all over it. I thought I’d 
found somethin’ to go with the 
vodka I half inched . But it 
won’t.” 

“Then what is it?” 

“Come and see.” 

“All right.” Briefly Grimes won- 
dered if he should tell Craven, who 
had relieved the watch, then de- 
cided against it. The Old Man would 
probably insist on making an in- 
vestigation in person, in which case 
Grimes would have to pass another 
boring hour or so in the control 
room. 

The two men made their way aft, 
until they came to the forward bulk- 
head of the cargo spaces. Normally 
these would have been pressurized, 
but, when Epsilon Sextans' atmos- 
phere had been replenished from 
Delta Orionis' emergency cylinders, 
it had seemed pointless to waste 
precious oxygen. So access was 
through an airlock, outside which 
was a locker , in which suits, ready 
for immediate use, were stowed. 

Grimes and Baxter suited up, 
helping each other as required. Then 
the engineer put out his gloved hand 



126 



IF 




to the airlock controls. Grimes 
stopped him , bent forward to touch 
helmets. He said, “Hang on. If we 
open the door it’ll register on the 
panel in Control.” 

“Like hell it will!” came the reply. 
“Most of the wiring was slashed 
through during the piracy. I fixed 
the hold lights — but damn all else.” 
Grimes, through the transparency 
of the visors, saw the other’s grin. 
“For obvious reasons.” 

G rimes shrugged, released Baxter. 

Everything was so irregular 
that one more, relatively minor reg- 
ularity hardly mattered. With the 
engineer he squeezed into the small 
airlock, waited until the atmosphere 
it held had been pumped back into 
the body of the ship, then he him- 
self pushed the button that actuated 
the mechanism of the inner valve. 

This was not the first time that 
he had been in the cargo spaces. 
Some of the weapons “borrowed” 
from Delta Orionis * cargo had been 
mounted in the holds. When he had 
made his inspections, it had never 
occurred to him that the opening 
and closing of the airlock door had 
not registered in Control. 

He stood back and let Baxter lead 
the way. The engineer pulled him- 
self to one of the bins in which he 
had been foraging. The door to it 
was still open, and crates and car- 
tons disturbed by the pillager float- 
ed untidily around the opening. 

“You’ll have to get all this re- 
stowed,” said Grimes sharply. “If 
we have to accelerate there’ll be 
damage.” But he might as well have 
been speaking to himself. The suit 



radios had not been switched on; 
and, in any case, there was no air 
to carry sound waves, however 
faintly. 

Baxter had scrambled into the 
open bin. Grimes followed him, saw 
him standing by the case, its top 
prized open, that carried the letter- 
ing, BELUGA CAVIAR. PRO- 
DUCE OF THE RUSSIAN SO- 
CIAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC. 
Baxter beckoned. Grimes edged his 
way past the drifting packages to 
join him. 

There was something in the case, 
but it was not jars or cans of salted 
sturgeon’s eggs. It looked at first 
like a glittering, complex piece of 
mobile statuary, although it was 
motionless. It was a metal mismat- 
ing of gyroscope and Moebius Strip. 
It did not look wrong — nothing 
functional ever does — but it did 
look odd. 

Grimes was standing hard against 
Baxter now. Their helmets were 
touching. He asked, “What . 
what is it?” 

“I was hopin’ you’d be able ter 
tell me, Admiral.” Then, as Grimes 
extended a cautious hand into the 
case, “Careful! Don’t touch noth- 




“ ’Cause this bloody lot was boo- 
by-trapped, that’s why. See that 
busted spring? An’ see that cylinder 
in the comer? That’s a thermite 
bomb, or somethin’ worse. Shoulda 
gone orf when I pried the lid up, 
but luckily I buggered the firin’ 
mechanism with me bar when I 
stuck it inter just the right crack. 
But I think it’s deloused now.” 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



127 




“It looks as though it — what- 
ever it is — is hooked up to one of 
the electrical circuits . ” 

“Yair. An’ it’s not the lightin’ 
circuit. Must be the airlock indi- 
cators ...” 

“Must be.” As a weapons expert, 
Grimes could see that the thermite 
bomb — if that was what it was — 
had been rendered ineffective. It 
hadn’t been an elaborate trap, mere- 
ly a device that would destroy the 
. the thing if the case housing 
it were tampered with. Baxter had 
been lucky, and, presumably, those 
who had planted the — what the 
hell was it? — unlucky. 

With a cautious finger he nudged 
the rotor. 

It turned, and he was reminded 
of those other rotors, the ever-pre- 
cessing gyroscopes of the Manns- 
chenn Drive. 

H e remembered, then. He re- 
membered a series of lectures 
at the Academy on future weapons 
and navigational devices. Having 
decided upon his specialty he had 
been really interested only in the 
weapons. But there had been talk 
of a man called Carlotti, who was 
trying to develop a device that 
would induce temporal precession 
in radio signals, so that instantan- 
eous communications would be pos- 
sible throughout the galaxy without 
ships and shore stations having to 
rely upon the tempermental and un- 
reliable telepaths. And beacons, em- 
ploying the same principle, could be 
used for navigation by ships under 
interstellar drive. 

So this could be one of Signor 

128 



Carlotti’s gadgets. Perhaps the Em- 
pire of Waverly had offered him a 
higher price than had the Federa- 
tion. But Why the BELUGA CAV- 
IAR? To deter and confuse indus- 
trial spies? But Epsilon Sextans' 
possessed excellent strongrooms for 
the carriage of special cargo. 

And why was the thing wired up? 

Suddenly it was obvious. Some- 
how, the Duchy of Waldgren pos- 
sessed Carlotti equipment. This . 
this beacon had been transmitting, 
unknown to anybody aboard the 
ship, during the voyage. The fri- 
gates had homed upon her. When, 
inadvertently, its power supply had 
been shut off the victim, using ran- 
dom precession, had been able to 
make her escape. 

So, if the pirates were to make 
a second attack it would have to 
be reactivated. 

“We’d better throw this lot on to 
the Old Man’s plate,” said Grimes. 

C aptain Craven listened intently 
as Grimes and Baxter told their 
story. They feared that he was go- 
ing to lose his temper when told 
of the engineer’s cargo pillaging, 
but he only remarked, in a dry 
voice, “I guess that the consignees 
can afford to compensate us for 
our time and trouble. Even so, Mr. 
Baxter, this practice must cease.” 
And then, when Grimes described 
the device, he said, “Yes, I have 
heard of Carlotti’s work. But I 
didn’t think that he’d got as far as 
a working model. But the thing 
could have been developed by Wal- 
degrenese scientists from the data 
in his published papers.” 



IF 




“So you agree, sir, that it is some 
kind of beacon upon which the pi- 
rates can home?” 

“What else can it be? Now, gen- 
tlemen, we find ourselves upon the 
horns of a dilemna. If we don’t re- 
activate the bloody thing, the 
chances are that we shall deliver 
ship and cargo intact, at no great 
risk to ourselves, and to the joy of 
the underwriters. If we do reactiv- 
ate it, then the chances are that we 
shall have. to fight our way through. 
And there’s no guarantee that we 
shall be on the winning side.” 

“I was shanghaied away here as 
a gunnery officer,” said Grimes. 

“Shanghaied — or press-ganged?” 
queried Craven. 

“The technique was more that of 
the shanghai,” Grimes told him. 

“Indeed?” Craven’s voice was 
cold. “But no matter. You’re here, 
and you’re one of my senior officers. 
What course do you recommend?” 
Grimes replied slowly and care- 
fully. “Legally speaking, what we’re 
involved in isn’t a war. But it is a 
war, of sorts. And a just war. And, 
in any case, the master of a mer- 
chant vessel has the legal right to 
resist illegal seizure or destruction 
by force of arms. Of course, we 
have to consider the illegal circum- 
stances attending the arming of 
this ship ...” 

“Let’s not get bogged down in 
legalities and illegalities,” said Cra- 
ven, with a touch of impatience. 
“The lawyers can sort it all out 
eventually. Do we reactivate?” 
“Yes,” said Grimes. 

“And you, Mr. Baxter. What do 
you say?” 



“We Rim Worlders just don’t like 
Waldegren. I’ll not pass up a chance 
ter kick the bastards in the teeth. 
Reactivate, Skipper.” 

“Good. And how long will it take 
you to make good the circuit the 
beacon’s spliced in to?” 

“Twenty minutes. No more. But 
d’yer think we oughter put the 
whole thing to the vote first?” 

“No. Everybody here was under 
the impression that we should be 
fighting. With one possible excep- 
tion, they’re all volunteers.” 

“But I did volunteer, sir,” ob- 
jected Grimes. 

“Make your mind up, Ensign. 
You were telling me just now that 
you’d been shanghaied. All right. 
Everybody is a volunteer. So we 
just rebait the trap without any 
more yapping about it. Let me know 
as soon as you’re ready, Mr. Baxter. 
Will you require assistance?” 

“I’ll manage. Skipper.” 

W hen he was gone Craven 
turned to Grimes. “You re- 
alize, Ensign, that this puts me in 
rather a jam. Let me put it this way. 
Am I justified in risking the lives 
of all my officers to carry out a 
private act of vengeance?” 

“I think that you can take Mr. 
Baxter and myself as being repre- 
sentative, sir. As for the others — 
Miss Pentecost’s a Rim Worlder, 
and her views will coincide with 
Baxter’s. And the original crew 
members, they’re just as entitled to 
vengeance as you are. I know that 
if I’d been an officer of this ship 
at the time of the original piracy, 
I’d enjoy getting revenge.” 



130 



IF 




“ You would. Yes. Even if, as 
now, an alternative suddenly pre- 
sented itself. But ...” 

“I honestly don’t see what you’re 
worrying about, sir.” 

“You wouldn’t. It’s a matter of 
training. But, for all my reserve 
commission, I’m a merchant officer. 
Oh, I know that any military com- 
mander is as responsible for the 
lives of his men as I am, but he 
also knows that those lives, like his 
own, are expendable.” 

“It’s a pity that Baxter found 
the beacon,” said Grimes. 

“It is — and it isn’t. If he hadn’t 
found it, I shouldn’t be soliloquizing 
like a spacefaring Hamlet. And we 
should have brought the ship in in- 
tact and, like as not, all been award- 
ed Lloyd’s Medal. On the other 
hand, if he hadn’t found it we — 
or I? — should have lost our chance 
of getting back at the pirates.” 
“You aren’t Hamlet, sir.” Grimes 
spoke with the assurance of the 
very young, but in later years he 
was to remember his words and to 
feel neither shame nor embarrass- 
ment, but only a twinge of envy 
and regret. “You aren’t Hamlet. 
You’re Captain Craven, Master un- 
der God. Please, sir, for once in 
your life do something you want to 
do and argue it out later with the 
Almighty if you must.” 

“And with my Owners?” Grimes 
couldn’t be sure, but he thought he 
saw something like a smile beneath 
Craven’s full beard. “And with my 
Owners?” 

“Master Astronauts’ certificates 
aren’t all that common, sir. If the 
worst comes to the worst, there’s 



always the Rim Worlds. The Sun- 
downer Line, isn’t it?” 

“I’d already thought of that.” 
There was no doubt about it. Cra- 
ven was smiling. “After all that 
you’ve been saying to me, I’m sur- 
prised that you don’t join forces 
with our Miss Pentecost.” 

“Go out to the Rim, sir? Hardly.” 
“Don’t be so bloody sure, young 
Grimes. Anyhow, you’d better get 
Miss Pentecost up here now so that 
we can see how friend Baxter is 
getting on. There’s always the risk 
that he’ll find a few more things 
among the cargo that aren’t nailed 
down.” 

XV 

G rimes called Jane Pentecost on 
the intercom; after a minute or 
so she made her appearance in Con- 
trol. Craven told her what Baxter 
had discovered and what he. Craven, 
intended doing about it. She nodded 
in emphatic agreement. “Yes,” she 
said. “The thing’s here to be used — 
and to be used the way that we 
want to use it. But I don’t think 
that we should make it public.” 
“Why not, Miss Pentecost?” 

“I could be wrong, Captain, but 
in my opinion there are quite a few 
people in this ship who’d welcome 
the chance of wriggling out of being 
the cheese in the mousetrap. When 
there’s no alternative they’re brave 
enough. When there’s a face-saving 
alternative ...” 

Baxter’s voice came from the in- 
tercom speaker. “Chief Reaction 
Drive Engineer to Control. Repairs 
completed. Check your panel.” 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



131 




Yes, the circuit had been restored. 
The buzzer sounded, and on the 
board a glowing red light showed 
that the outer door to the cargo 
hold airlock was open. How much 
of the failure of the indicators was 
due to battle damage and how much 
to Baxter’s sabotage would never 
be known. Craven’s heavy eyebrows 
lifted ironically as he looked at 
Grimes, and Grimes shrugged in 
reply. 

Then, the watch handed over to 
the girl, the two men made their 
way aft from the control room. 
Outside the airlock they found Bax- 
ter, already suited up save for his 
helmet. There had been only two 
suits in the locker, and the engineer 
had brought another one along for 
the captain from somewhere. 

The little compartment would 
take only two men at a time. Cra- 
ven and Grimes went through first, 
then were joined by Baxter. There 
was no longer any need for secrecy, 
so the suit radios were switched on. 
The only person likely to be listen- 
ing in was Jane Pentecost in the con- 
trol room. 

Grimes heard Craven muttering 
angrily as they passed packages that 
obviously had been opened and pil- 
laged, but the captain did no more 
than mutter. He possessed the sense 
of proportion so essential to his 
rank, and a few bulbs of looted li- 
quor were, after all, relatively un- 
important. 

They came to the bin in which 
the case allegedly containing caviar 
had been stowed, in which some 
secret agent of Waldegren had tap- 
ped the circuit supplying power to 



the beacon. Inside the box the 
gleaming machine was still motion- 
less. Craven said, “I thought you 
told me the current was on.” 

“It is, Skipper.” Baxter’s voice 
was pained. “But I switched it off 
before I fixed the wiring.” He ex- 
tended a gtoved finger, pressed a 
little toggle switch. 

And nothing happened. 

“Just a nudge ...” whispered 
the engineer. 

The oddly convoluted rotor turn- 
ed easily enough, and as it rotated 
it seemed almost to vanish in a mist 
of its own generating — a mist that 
was no more than an optical illusion. 

It rotated, slowed and stopped. 

Baxter cast aspersions upon the 
legitimacy of its parenthood. Then, 
still grumbling, he produced a volt- 
meter. Any doubt that power was 
being delivered to the machine was 
soon dispelled. Power was being de- 
livered — but it was not being used. 

“Well, Mr. Baxter?” demanded 
Craven. 

“I’m a fair mechanic, Skipper, 
but I’m no physicist . .” 

“Mr. Grimes?” 

“I specialized in gunnery, sir.” 

Craven snorted, the sound un- 
pleasantly loud in the helmetphones. 
He said sarcastically, “I’m only the 
captain, but I have some smatter- 
ings of Mannschenn Drive mainten- 
ance and operation. This thing isn’t 
a Mannschenn Drive unit — but 
it’s first cousin to one. As I recall 
it, some of the earlier models 
couldn’t be started without the em- 
ployment of a small, temporal pre- 
cession field initiator. Furthermore, 
these initiators, although there is ne 



132 



IF 




longer any need for them, are still 
carried as engineroom spares in the 
Commission’s ships.” 

“And that gadget’ll start this little 
time-twister, Skipper?” asked the 
engineer. 

“It might, Mr. Baxter. It might. 
So, Mr. Grimes, will yon go along 
to the Mannsohenn Drive room and 
ask Mr. Wolverton for his initiator? 
No need to tell him what it’s for.” 

T X 7olverton was in the Manns- 
V V chenn Drive room, staring 
moodily at the gleaming complexity 
of processing rotors. Grimes hastily 
averted his eyes from the machine. 
It frightened him, and he didn’t 
mind admitting it. And there was 
something about the engineer that 
frightened him, too. The tall, cada- 
verous man, with the thin strands 
of black hair drawn over his gleam- 
ing skull, looked more like a seer 
than a ship’s officer, looked like a 
fortune-teller peering into the depths 
of an uncannily mobile crystal ball. 
He was mumbling, his voice a low, 
guttural muttering against the thin, 
high keening of his tumbling gyro- 
scopes. The ensign at last was able 
to make out the words. 

“Divergent tracks ... To be, or 
not to be, that is the question ...” 

Grimes thought, This ship should 
be renamed the “State of Den- 
mark.” There* s something rotten 
here. He said sharply, “Mr. Wolver- 
ton!” 

Slowly the Chief Interstellar Drive 
Engineer turned his head, stared at 
Grimes unseeingly at first. His eyes 
came into focus. He whispered, “It’s 
you.” 



“Who else, Chief? Captain’s com- 
pliments, and he’d like to borrow 
your temporal precession field initia- 
tor” 

“He would, would he? And why?” 
“An ... An experiment ...” 
said Grimes, with partial truth. The 
fewer people who knew the whole 
truth the better. 

“An experiment?” 

“Yes. If you wouldn’t mind let- 
ting me have it now, Chief ...” 
“But it’s engineroom stores. It’s 
the Commission’s stores. It’s a very 
delicate instrument. It is against the 
Commission’s regulations to issue 
it to unqualified personnel.” 

“But Mr. Baxter is helping with 
the . experiment.” 

“Mr. Baxter! That letter-off of 
cheap fireworks. That ... - Rim 
Runner! No. No. Mr. Baxter is not 
qualified personnel.” 

“Then perhaps you could lend 
us one of your juniors ...” 

“No. No, I would not trust them. 
Why do you think that I am here, 
Mr. Grimes? Why do you think 
that I have been tied to my gyro- 
scopes? Literally tied, almost. If I 
had not been here, keeping my own 
watch, when the pirates struck, this 
ship would have been utterly destroy- 
ed. I know the Drive, Mr. Grimes 
...” He seized the ensign’s arm, 
turned him so that he was facing 
the gleaming, spinning rotors, end- 
lessly precessing, endlessly tumbling 
down the dark dimensions, shimmer- 
ing on the very verge of invisibility. 
Grimes wanted to close his eyes, 
but could not. “I know the Drive, 
Mr. Grimes. It talks to me. It shows 
me things. It warned me, that Time, 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



133 




that Death was waiting for this 
ship and all in her. And now it 
warns me again. But there is a . 
a divergence ...” 

“Mr. Wolverton, please! There 
is not much time.” 

“But what is Time, Mr. Grimes? 
What is Time? What do you know 
of the forking World Lines, the 
Worlds of If? I’ve lived with this 
machine, Mr. Grimes. It’s part of 
me — or am I part of it? Let me 
show you.” His grip on the ensign’s 
arm was painful. “Let me show you. 
Lo#k. Look into the machine. What 
do you see?” 

G rimes saw only shadowy, shim- 
mering wheels and a formless 
darkness. 

“I see you, Mr. Grimes,” almost 
sang the engineer. “I see you — 
but not as you will be. But as you 
might be. I see you on the bridge 
of your flagship, your gold uniform 
gold-encrusted and medal-bedecked, 
with commodores and captains sa- 
luting you and calling you ‘sir’ . 
But I see you, too, in the control 
room of a shabby little ship, a single 
ship, in shabby clothes, and the 
badge on your cap is one that I 
have never seen, is one that does 
not yet exist ...” 

“Mr. Wolverton! That initiator. 
Please !” 

“But there is no hurry, Mr. 
Grimes. There is no hurry. There is 
Time enough for everything — for 
that is, that has been, that will be 
and that might be. There is Time to 
decide, Mr. Grimes. There is Time 
to decide whether or not we make 
our second rendezvous with Death. 



The initiator is part of it all, Mr. 
Grimes, is it not? The initiator is 
the signpost that stands at the fork- 
ing of the track. You weren’t here, 
Mr. Grimes, when the pirates struck. 
You did not hear the screams, you 
did not smell the stench of burning 
flesh. You’re young and foolhardy; 
all that you want is the chance to 
play with your toys. And all that I 
want, now that I know that alterna- 
tives exist, is the chance to bring 
this ship to her destination with no 
further loss of life.” 

“Mr. Wolverton ...” 

“Mr. Grimes!” It was Captain 
Craven’s voice, and he was in a 
vile temper. “What the hell do you 
think you’re playing at?” 

“Captain,” said Wolverton, “I can 
no more than guess at what you in- 
tend to do, but I have decided not 
to help you to do it.” 

“Then give us the initiator. We’ll 
work it ourselves.” 

“No, Captain.” 

“Give me the initiator, Mr. Wol- 
verton. That’s an order.” 

“A lawful command, Captain? As 
lawful as those commands of yours 
that armed this ship?” 

“Hold him, Grimes!” (And who’s 
supposed to be holding whom? won- 
dered the ensign. Wolverton’s grip 
was still tight and painful on his 
arm.) “Hold him, while I look in 
the storeroom!” 

“Captain! Get away from that 
door! You’ve no right ...” 

Wolverton relinquished his hold 
on Grimes, who, twisting with* an 
agility that surprised himself, con- 
trived to get both arms about the 
engineer’s waist. In the scuffle the 



134 



IF 




contact between their magnetic shoe 
soles and the deck was broken. They 
hung there, helpless, with no solid- 
ity within reach of their flailing 
limbs to give them purchase. They 
hung there, clinging to each other, 
but more in hate than in love. Wol- 
verton’s back was to the machine; 
he could not see, as could Grimes, 
that there was an indraught of air 
into the spinning, shimmering com- 
plexity. Grimes felt the beginnings 
of panic, more than the mere be- 
ginnings. There were no guardrails; 
he had read somewhere why this 
was so, but the abstruse physics in- 
volved did not matter — all that 
mattered was there was nothing to 
prevent him and Wolverton from 
being drawn into the dimension- 
twisting field of the thing. 

He freed, somehow, his right 
hand, and with an effort that sprain- 
ed his shoulder brought it round in 
a sweeping, clumsy and brutal blow 
to the engineer’s face. Wolverton 
screamed, and his grip relaxed. Vio- 
lently, Grimes shoved away. 

Craven emerged from the store- 
room, tarrying something that look- 
ed like a child’s toy gyroscope in a 
transparent box. He looked around 
for Grimes and Wolverton at deck 
level and then, his face puzzled, 
looked up. He did not, as Grimes 
had been doing for some seconds, 
vomit; but his face, behind the 
beard, went chalk-white. He put out 
his free hand and, not ungently, 
pulled Grimes to the deck. 

He said, his voice little more than 
a whisper, “There’s nothing we can 
do. Nothing, except to get a pistol 
and finish him off . ” 



Grimes forced himself to look 
again at the slimy, bloody obscenity 
that was a man turned, literally, in- 
side-out — heart (if it was the 
heart) still beating, intestines still 
writhing. 

After a spasm of painful retching 
he gasped, “He kept his own ren- 
dezvous with Death!” 

XVI 

I t was Grimes, who went for a 
pistol, fetching a Minetti from 
the weapons rack that he, himself, 
had fitted up in the control room. 
He told Jane Pentecost what he 
wanted it for. He made no secret 
of either his horror or his self-blame. 

She said, “But this is a war, even 
if it’s an undeclared one. And in 
a war you must expect casualties.” 
“Yes, yes. I know. But / pushed 
him into the field.” 

“It was an accident. It could easi- 
ly have been you instead of him. 
And I’m glad that it wasn’t.” 

“But you haven’t seen ...” 

“And I don’t want to.” Her voice 
hardened. “Meanwhile, get the hell 
out of here and back to the Manns- 
chenn Drive room. If you’re so sor- 
ry for the poor bastard, do some- 
thing about putting him out of his 
misery.” 

“But ...” 

“Don’t be such a bloody coward, 
Grimes.” 

The words hurt, mainly because 
there was so much truth in them. 
Grimes was dreading having to see 
again the twisted obscenity that had 
once been a man, was dreading 
having to breathe again the atmo- 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



135 




sphere of that compartment, heavy 
with the reek of hot oil, blood and 
faecal matter. But, with the excep- 
tion of Craven, he was the only per- 
son in the ship trained in the arts 
of war. He recalled the words of a 
Surgeon-Commander who had lec- 
tured the midshipmen of his course 
on the handling of battle casualties 
and recalled, too, how afterwards 
the young gentlemen had sneered 
at the bloodthirstiness of one who 
was supposed to be a professional 
healer. “ When one of your ship- 
mates has really had it, even if he's 
your best friend, don't hesitate a 
moment about finishing him off . 
You'll be doing him a kindness . Fin- 
ish him off — and get him out of 
sight . Shockingly wounded men are 
bad for morale." 

“What are you waiting for?” de- 
manded Jane Pentecost. “Do you 
want me to do it?” 

Grimes said nothing, just hurried 
out of the control room. 

C raven was still in the Manns- 
chenn Drive room when Grimes 
got back there. With him were two 
of the interstellar drive engineers 
— the second and the third. Their 
faces were deathly white, and the 
second’s prominent Adam’s apple 
was working spasmodically, but 
about them was an air of grim res- 
olution. The third — how could he 
bear to touch that slimy, reeking 
mess? — had hold of the thing's 
shoulders (white, fantastically con- 
torted bone gleaming pallidly among 
red convolutions of flesh) while the 
second, a heavy spanner in his hand, 
was trying to decide where to strike. 



The captain saw Grimes. “Give 
me that!” he snapped and snatched 
the pistol from the ensign’s hand. 
Then, to the engineers, “Stand 
back!” 

The little weapon rattled sharply 
and viciously. To the other smells 
was added the acridity of burned 
propellant. What had been Wolver- 
ton was driven to the deck by the 
impact of the tiny projectiles and 
adhered there. There was surprising- 
ly little blood, but the body had 
stopped twitching. 

Craven handed the empty pistol 
“You stay here, Mr. Grimes, and 
organize the disposal of the body.” 
He went to the locker where he had 
put the initiator, took out the little 
instrument and, carrying it carefully, 
left the Mannschenn Drive room. 
Neither of the engineers, still star- 
ing with horrified fascination at 
their dead chief, noticed. 

“How . How did it happen?” 
asked the second, after a long si- 
lence. 

“He fell into the field,” said 
Grimes. 

“But how? How? He was always 
getting on to us about being careless 
and telling us what was liable to hap- 
pen to us, and now it’s happened to 
him ... ” 

“That’s the way of it,” contri- 
buted the third, with a certain glum 
satisfaction. “Don’t do as I do, do 
as I say ...” 

“Have you a box?” asked Grimes. 

“A box?” echoed the Second. 

“Yes. A box.” Now that he was 
doing something, doing something 
useful, Grimes was beginning to feel 
a little better. “We can’t have a fun- 



136 



IF 




eral while we’re running under inter- 
stellar drive. We have to ... to put 
him somewhere.” Out of sight, he 
mentally added. 

“That chest of spares?” muttered 
the second. 

“Just the right size,” agreed the 
third. 

“Then get it,” ordered Grimes. 

The chest, once the spares and 
their packing had been removed and 
stowed elsewhere, was just the right 
size. Its dimensions were almost those 
of a coffin. It was made of steel, its 
bottom magnetized, and remained 
where placed on the deck while the 
three men, fighting down their re- 
curring nausea, handled the body in- 
to it. All of them sighed audibly in 
relief when, at last, the close-fitting 
lid covered the remains. Finally, the 
third ran a welding torch around the 
joint. As he was doing so the lights 
flickered. 

Was it because of the torch? won- 
dered Grimes. Or was it because the 
beacon in the hold had been reacti- 
vated? Somehow he could not feel 
any real interest. 

C leaned up after a fashion, but 
still feeling physically ill, he was 
back in the control room. Craven 
was there, and Baxter was with him. 
Jane Pentecost had been relieved 
so that she could attend to her 
duties in the galley. “Not that / 
feel like a meal,” the captain had 
said. “And I doubt very much that 
Mr. Grimes does either.” 

“Takes a lot ter put me off me 
tucker,” the engineer declared cheer- 
fully as he worked on the airlock 
door’s tell-tale panel. 

THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



“You didn’t see Mr. Wolverton, 
Mr. Baxter,” said Craven grimly. 

“No, Skipper. An’ I’m not sorry 
I didn’t.” He paused in ihis work to 
rummage in his tool bag. He pro- 
duced bulbs of brandy. “But I 
thought you an’ the ensign might 
need some o’ this.” 

Craven started to say something 
about cargo pillage, then changed 
his mind. He accepted the liquor 
without further quibbling. The three 
men sipped in silence. 

Baxter carelessly tossed his 
squeezed empty bulb aside, continu- 
ed with what he had been doing. 
The Captain said to Grimes, “Yes. 
We got the bloody thing started 
again. And we’ve improved upon 
it.” 

“Improved upon it, sir? How?” 

“It’s no jonger only a beacon. 
It’s also an alarm. As soon as it 
picks up the radiation from the sim- 
iliar pieces of apparatus aboard the 
enemy frigates, the buzzer that Mr. 
Baxter is fitting up will sound; the 
red light will flash. We shall have 
ample warning . ” 

“She’ll be right, Skipper,” said 
the engineer. 

“Thank you, Mr. Baxter. And 
now, if you don’t mind, I’d like a 
few words in private with Mr. 
Grimes.” 

“Don’t be too hard on him, Skip- 
per.” 

Baxter winked cheerfully at 
Grimes and left the control room. 

“Mr. Grimes,” Craven’s voice 
was grave. “Mr. Grimes, today, 
early in your career, you have learn- 
ed a lesson that some of us never 
have to learn. You have killed a 

137 




man — yes, yes, I know that it was 
not intentional — and you have 
been privileged to. see the end re- 
sult of your actions. 

“There are many of us who are, 
who have been killers. There are 
many of us who have pushed but- 
tons but who have never seen what 
happens at the other end of the 
trajectory. Perhaps people slaughter- 
ed by explosion or, laser beam do 
not look quite so horrible as Wol- 
verton — but, I assure you, they 
often die as slowly and as agonizing- 
ly* 

“You know, now, what violent 
death looks like, Mr. Grimes. 

‘Tell me, are you still willing to 
push your buttons, to play pretty 
tunes on your battle organ?” 

“And what did the bodies in 
this ship look like, Captain?” asked 
Grimes, Then, remembering that 
one of the bodies had belonged to 
the woman whom Craven had loved, 
he bitterly regretted having asked 
the question. 

“Not pretty,” whispered Captain 
Craven. “Not at all pretty.” 

“I’ll push your button for you,” 
Grimes told him. 

And for Jane Pentecost , he 
thought. And for the others . And 
for myself? The worst of it all is 
that l haven't got the excuse of say - 
ing that it's what I'm paid for . 

XVII 

D own the dark dimensions fell 
Epsilon Sextans, falling free 
through the warped continuum. 

But aboard the ship Time still 
possessed meaning, the master chron- 



ometer still ticked away the seconds, 
minutes and hours; the little, man- 
made world was still faithful to that 
puissant god of scientific intelli- 
gences everywhere in the Universe 
— the Clock. Watch succeeded 
watch in the control room and 
engineroom. Meals were prepared 
and served on time. There was even, 
towards the end, a revival of off- 
duty social activities; a chess set was 
discovered and brought into use, 
playing cards were produced and a 
bridge school was formed. 

But there was one social activity 
that, to Grimes’ disappointment, 
was not resumed — the oldest social 
activity of them all. More than once 
he pleaded with Jane, and every 
time she laughed away his pleas. He 
insisted; and that made matters 
worse. He was (as he said) the don- 
key who had been allowed one nib- 
ble of the carrot and who could 
not understand why the carrot had 
been snatched away. He was (she 
said) a donkey. Period. 

He should have guessed what 
was happening, but he did not. He 
was young and inexperienced in the 
ways of women — of men and wom- 
en. He just could not imagine that 
Jane would spare more than a cas- 
ual glance for any of the engineers 
or for the flabby, pasty youth who 
was the psionic radio officer. And 
in this he was right. 

Epsilon Sextans was, for a ship 
of her class, very well equipped. In 
addition to the usual intercom sys- 
tem she was fitted with closed-cir- 
cuit television. In the event of emer- 
gency the captain or watch officer, 
by the flip of a switch, could see 



138 



IF 




what was happening in any com- 
partment of the vessel. Over the 
control panel, in big, red letters, 
were the words: EMERGENCY 
USE ONLY. Grimes did not know 
what the penalty for improper use 
of the apparatus in the Merchant 
Navy, hut he did know that in the 
Survey Service officers had been 
cashiered and given an ignominious 
discharge for this offense. The more 
cramped and crowded the conditions 
in which men — and women — 
work and live, the more precious is 
privacy. 

It was Grimes’ watch. 

When he had taken over, all the 
indications were that it would be 
as boring as all the previous watches. 
All that was required of the watch- 
keeper was that he stay awake. 
Grimes stayed awake. He had 
brought a book with him into Con- 
trol, hiding it inside his uniform 
shirt, and it held his attention for 
a while. Then, following the exam- 
ple of generations of watch officers, 
he set up a game of three-dimen- 
sional noughts and crosses in the 
chart tank and played, right hand 
against left. The left hand was doing 
remarkably well when a buzzer 
sounded. The ensign immediately 
cleared the tank and looked at the 
airlock indicator panel. But there 
were no lights on the board, and 
he realized that it was the intercom 
telephone. 

(• 6 /Control, ” he said into his mic- 

v>4 rophone. 

“P.R.O. here. I . I’m not hap- 
py, Mr. Grimes ...” 

“Who is?” quipped Grimes. 



“I ... I feel . smothered . .” 
“Something wrong with the ven- 
tilation in your shack?” 

“No. NO. It’s like . it’s like 
a heavy blanket soaked in ice-cold 
water. You can’t move . You 
can’t shout . You can’t hear . 
It’s like it was before ...” 

“Before what?” snapped Grimes, 
and then as the other buzzer sound- 
ed, as the additional red light flashed 
on the tell-tale panel, he realized 
the stupidity of his question. 

At once he pressed the alarm but- 
ton. This was it, at last. Action Sta- 
tions! Throughout the ship the bells 
were shrilling, the klaxons squawk- 
ing. Hastily Grimes vacated the 
pilot’s chair, slipped into the one 
from which he could control his 
weapons and from which he could 
reach out to other controls. But 
where was the Old Man? Where was 
Captain Craven? This was the mo- 
ment that he had longed for, this 
was the consummation toward which 
all his illegalities had been directed. 
Damn it all, where was he? 

Perhaps he was floating stunned 
in his quarters, starting up hurriedly 
from sleep he could have struck his 
head upon some projection, knocked 
himself out. If this were the case 
he, Grimes, would have to call Jane 
from her own battle station in the 
Sick Bay to render first aid. But 
there was no time to lose. 

The ensign reached out, flipped 
the switches that would give him 
the picture of the interior of the 
captain’s accommodation. The 
screen brightened, came alive. 
Grimes stared at the luminous pre- 
sentation in sick horror. Luminous 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



139 





it was with that peculiar luminosity 
of naked female flesh. Jane was 
dressing herself with almost ludi- 
crous haste. Of the Captain there 
was no sign — on the screen. 

Craven snarled, with cold fero- 
city, “You damned, sneaking prur- 
rient puppy!” Then, in a louder 
voice, “Switch that bloody thing 
off! I’ll deal with you when this is 
over.” 

“But, sir . ” 

“Switch it off, I say!” 

Cheeks burning, Grimes obeyed. 
Then he sat staring at his armament 
controls, fighting down his nausea, 
his physical sickness. Somehow he 
found time to think bitterly, So I 
was the knight , all set and ready 
to slay dragons for his lady. And 
all the time, she ... He did not 
finish the thought. 

He heard a voice calling over the 
intercom, one of the engineers. 
“Captain, they’re trying to lock on! 
Same as last time. Random preces- 
sion, sir?” 

“No. Cut the Drive!” 

“Cut the Drive?” incredulously. 

“You heard me. Cut!” Then, to 
Grimes, And what the hell are you 
waiting for?” 

HPhe ensign knew what he had to 
X do; he had rehearsed it often 
enough. He did it. From the nozzles 
that pierced the outer shell spouted 
the cloud of reflective vapor, just 
in time, just as the enemy’s lasers 
lashed out at their target. 

It seemed that the ship’s internal 
temperature rose suddenly and 
sharply — although that could have 
been illusion, festered by the sight 



140 



IF 





of the fiery fog glimpsed through 
the viewports before the armored 
shutters slammed home. 

There were targets now on 
Grimes’ fire-control screen, two of 
them, but he could not loose a mis- 
sile 'Until the tumbling rotors of the 
Drive had ceased to spin, to process. 
The use of the antilaser-vapor screen 
had been risky enough. Abruptly 
the screens went blank, which signi- 
fied that the temporal precession 
rates of hunted and hunters were no 
longer in synchronization, that the 
fields of the pirates had failed to 
lock on. In normal Space-Time there 
would be no need to synchronize, 
and then the hunters would discover 
that their quarry had claws and 
teeth. 

Aboard Epsilon Sextans the keen- 
ing note of the Drive died to a whis- 
per, a barely audible murmur, fad- 
ing to silence. There was the inevit- 
able second or so of utter disorien- 
tation when, as soon as it was safe, 
the engineers braked the gyroscopes. 

Craven acted without hesitation, 
giving his ship headway and acceler- 
ation with Inertial Drive. He was 
not running — although this was the 
impression that he wished to convey. 
He was inviting rather than evading 
combat; but if the Waldegren cap- 
tains choose to assume that Epsilon 
Sextans was, as she had been, an 
unarmed merchantman (after all, 
the anti-laser screen could have been 
jury rigged from normal ship’s 
stores and equipment) taking eva- 
sive action, that was their error of 
judgment. 

Grimes watched his screen intent- 
ly. Suddenly the two blips reappear- 



ed, astern, all of a hundred kilo- 
meters distant, but closing. This he 
reported. 

“Stand by for acceleration!” or- 
dered Craven. “Reaction Drive — 
stand by!” 

It was all part of the pattern — 
a last, frantic squandering of reac- 
tion mass that could do more than 
delay the inevitable. It would look 
good from the enemy control rooms. 

“Reaction Drive ready!” reported 
Baxter over the intercom. 

“Thank you. Captain to all hands, 
there will be no count-down. Fire!” 

F rom the corner of his eye Grimes 
saw Craven’s hand slam down 
the key. Acceleration slammed him 
brutally back into his chair. 

There was a roar that was more 
like an explosion than a normal 
rocket firing, a shock that jarred 
and rattled every fitting in the con- 
trol room. 

Craven remarked quietly, “That 
must have looked convincing enough 
— but I hope that Baxter didn’t real- 
ly blow a chamber ...” 

There was only the Internal Drive 
now, and the two blips that, very 
briefly, had fallen astern, were now 
creeping up again, closing the range. 

“Anti-laser,” ordered Craven 
briefly. 

“But, sir, it’ll just be wasting it. 
They’ll not be using laser outside 
twenty kilometers.” 

“They’ll not be expecting a gun- 
nery specialist aboard this wagon, 
either.” 

Once again the nozzles spouted, 
pouring out a cloud that fell rapidly 
astern of the running ship. 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



141 




Craven looked at his own screens, 
frowned, muttered, “They’re taking 
their bloody time about it . Prob- 
ably low on reaction mass them- 
selves ...” He turned to Grimes. 
“I think a slight breakdown of the 
I.D.’s in order.” 

“As you say, sir.” The ensign 
could not forget having been called 
a damned, sneaking, prurient puppy. 
Let Craven make his own decisions. 

“Stand by for deceleration,” or- 
dered the captain quietly. The steady 
throbbing of the Inertial Drive falter- 
ed, faltered and ceased. There were 
two long minutes of Free Fall, of 
weightlessness, and then, for five 
minutes, the Drive came back into 
operation. A breakdown , the enemy 
must be thinking. A breakdown , and 
the engineers sweating and striving 
to get the ship under way again . A 
breakdown ... It would not be sur- 
prising after the mauling she had 
endured at the first encounter. 

She hung there, and although her 
actual speed could be measured in 
kilometers a second she was, inso- 
far as her accelerating pursuers were 
concerned, relatively motionless. 
Grimes wondered why the warships 
did not use their radio, did not de- 
mand surrender. Epsilon Sextans ’ 
transceiver was switched on, but no 
sound issued from the speaker but 
the hiss and crackle of interstellar 
static. He voiced his puzzlement to 
Craven. 

Craven laughed grimly. “They 
know who we are — or they think 
that they know. And they know 
that we know who are they are. 
After what happened before, why 
should we expect mercy? All that 



we can do now — they think — is 
to get the Mannschenn Drive going 
again. But with that comic beacon 
of theirs working away merrily 
they’ll be able to home on us, no 
matter how random our presession.” 
He laughed again. “They haven’t a 
care in the world, bless their little 
black hearts . .” 

Grimes watched his screens. 
Forty kilometers . Thirty . “Sir, 
the ALGE?” he asked. 

“Yes. It’s your party now.” 

F or the third time reflective va- 
por gushed from the nozzles, 
surrounding the ship with a dense 
cloud. Craven, who had been watch- 
ing the dials of the external tem- 
perature thermometers, remarked 
quietly, “They’ve opened fire. The 
shell plating’s heating up. Fast.” 
And in the control room it felt 
hot — and hotter. Grimes pressed 
the button that unmasked his bat- 
teries. The gas screen, as well as 
affording protection from laser, hid 
the ship from visual observation. 
The enemy would not be expecting 
defence by force of arms. 

He loosed his first salvo, felt the 
ship tremble as the missiles ejected 
themselves from their launching 
racks. There they were on the screens 
— six tifiy sparks, six moronic me- 
chanical intelligences programmed 
to home upon and destroy, capable 
of countering evasive action so long 
as their propellant held out. There 
they were on the screens — six of 
them, then four, then one. This last 
missile almost reached its target — 
then it, too, blinked out. The 
Waldegren frigates were now using 



142 



IP 




their laser for defence and not at- 
tack. 

'“I don’t think,” remarked Craven 
quietly, “that they’ll be missiles. Not 
yet, anyhow. They want our cargo 
intact . He chuckled softly. “But 
we’ve got them worried.” 

Grimes didn’t bother to reply. The 
tell-tale lights on his panel told him 
that the six AVM launchers were 
reloaded. The AMM’s — the anti- 
missile missiles — had not yet been 
fired. Dare he risk their use against 
big targets? He carried in his maga- 
zines stock sufficient for three full 
salvoes only — and with no laser 
for antimissile work, dare he de- 
plete his supply of this ammuni- 
tion?” 

He had heard the AMM’s des- 
cribed as “vicious little brutes.” 
They were to the Anti-Vessel Mis- 
siles as terriers are to mastiffs. Their 
warheads were small, but this was 
compensated for by their greater 
endurance. They were, perhaps, a 
little more “intelligent” then the 
larger rockets — and Grimes, vague- 
ly foreseeing this present contingen- 
cy, had made certain modifications 
to their “brains.” 

He pushed the button that actu- 
ated his modifications, that over- 
rode the original programming. He 
depressed the firing stud. He felt 
the vibration as the war-rockets 
streaked away from the ship and on 
his screens watched the tiny points 
of light closing the range between 
themselves and the two big blips 
that were the targets. They were 
fast, and they were erratic. One was 
picked off by laser within the first 
ten seconds, but the others carried 



on, spurting and swerving, but al- 
ways boring in towards their ob- 
jectives. 

Grimes could imagine the enemy 
gunnery officers flailing their lasers 
like men, armed only with sticks, de- 
fending themselves against a horde 
of small, savage animals. There was, 
of course, one sure defence — to 
start up the Mannschenn Drive and 
to slip back into the warped con- 
tinuum where the missiles could not 
follow. But, in all probability, the 
Waldegren captains had yet to ac- 
cept the fact, emotionally, that this 
helpless merchantman had somehow 
acquired the wherewithal to strike 
back. 

T wo of the AMM’s were gone 
now, picked off by the enemy 
laser. Three were still closing on 
the target on Epsilon Sextan s* port 
quarter, and only one on the target 
abaft the starboard beam. Grimes 
loosed his second flight of AMM’s, 
followed it with a full salvo of 
AVM’s. Then, knowing that the pro- 
tective vapor screen must have been 
thinned and shredded by his rock- 
etry, he sent out of replenishing gush 
of reflective gas. 

He heard Craven cry out in exul- 
tation. The three AMM’s of the first 
flight had hit their target, the three 
sparks had fused with the blip that 
represented the raider to port. The 
three sparks that were the second 
flight were almost there, and over- 
taking them were the larger and 
brighter sparks of the second AVM 
salvo. The Anti-Missile Missiles 
would cause only minor damage to 
a ship — but, in all probability, they 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



143 




would throw fire control out of kil- 
ter, might even destroy laser pro- 
jections. In theory, one only AVM 
would suffice to destroy a frigate; 
a hit by three at once would make 
destruction a certainty. 

And so it was. 

Seen only on the radar screen, as 
a picture lacking in detail painted 
on a fluorescent surface by an elec- 
tron brush, it was anticlimactic. The 
blips, the large one, the three small 
ones and the three not so simall, 
merged. And then there was an odd- 
ly shaped blob of luminescence that 
slowly broke up into a cluster of 
glowing fragments, a gradually ex- 
panding cluster, a leisurely burgeon- 
ing flower of pale fire. 

Said Craven viciously, “The oth- 
er bastard’s got cold feet . .” 

And so it was. Where she had 
been on the screen was only dark- 
ness, a darkness in which the sparks 
that was missiles and anti-missiles 
milled about aimlessly. They would 
not turn upon each other — that 
would have been contrary to their 
programming. They would not, in 
theory, use their remaining fuel to 
home upon the only worthwhile tar- 
get remaining — Epsilon Sextans 
herself. But, as Craven knew and as 
Grimes knew, theory and practice 
do not always coincide. Ships have 
been destroyed by their own mis- 
siles. 

With reluctance Grimes pushed 
the DESTRUCT button. He said to 
the captain, gesturing towards the 
wreckage depicted on the screen, 
“Pick up survivors, sir? If there are 
any . .” 

“If there are any,” snarled 



Craven, “that’s their bad luck. No 
— we give chase to the other swine I” 

XVIII 

ive chase . 

It was easier said than done. 
The surviving frigate had restarted 
her Mannschenn Drive, had slipped 
back into the warped continuum 
where, unless synchronization of pre- 
cession rates were achieved and 
held, contact between vessels would 
be impossible. The Carlotti Beacon 
in Epsilon Sextans* hold was worse 
than useless; it had been designed 
to be homed upon, not as a direc- 
tion-finding instrument. (In any 
case, it could function as such only 
if the beacon aboard the Waldegren 
ship were working.) Neither Craven 
nor Grimes knew enough about the 
device to effect the necessary modi- 
fications. The interstellar drive en- 
gineers thought that they could 
do it, but their estimates as to the 
time required ranged from days to 
weeks. Obviously, as long as it was 
operating it would be of value to 
the enemy only. 

So it was switched off. 

There was only one method avail- 
able to Craven to carry out the pur- 
suit — psionic tracking. He went 
for his psionic radio officer, explain- 
ed the situation. The telepath was a 
young man, pasty faced, unhealthy 
looking, but not unintelligent. He 
said at once, “Do you think, cap- 
tain, that the other officers and 
myself are willing to carry on the 
fight? After all, we’ve made our 
point. Wouldn’t it be wisest to carry 
on, now, for Waverley?” 




144 



IF 




“Speaking for meself,” put in 
Baxter, who had accompanied June 
Pentecost to Control, “an* fer any 
other Rim Worlders present, I say 
that now the bastards are on the run 
it's the best time ter smack ’em 
again. An’ hard. An* the tame time 
twisters think the same as we do. 
I’ve already had words with ’em.” 
He glared at the telepath. “Our 
snoopin’ little friend here should 
know very well what the general 
consensus is.” 

“We do not pry,” said the com- 
munications officer stiffly. “But I 
am willing to abide by the will of 
the majority.” 

“And don’t the orders of the mas- 
ter come into it?” asked Craven, 
more in lamusement than anger. 

“Lawful commands, sir?” asked 
Grimes who, until now, had been 
silent. 

“Shut up!” snapped Jane Pente- 
cost. 

“Unluckily, sir,” the young man 
went on, “I do not possess the di- 
rection-finding talent. It is, as you 
know, quite rare . .” 

“Then what can you do?” de- 
manded Craven. 

“Sir, let me finish, please. The 
psionic damping device — I don’t 
know what it was, but I suspect that 
iTwas the brain of some animal with 
which I am unfamiliar — was in 
the ship that was destroyed. The 
other vessel carries only a normal 
operator, with normal equipment — 
himself and some sort of organic 
amplifier. He is still within range, 
and I can maintain a listening 
watch . .” 

“And suppose he listens to you?” 



asked the captain. “Even if you 
transmit nothing — as you will not 
do unless ordered by myself — there 
could be stray thoughts. And that, 
I suppose, applies to all of us.” 
The telepath smiled smugly. “Di- 
rection-finding is not the only talent. 
I’m something of a damper myself, 
although not in the same class as 
the one that was blown up. I give 
you my word sir, that this vessel is 
psionically silent.” He raised his 
hand as Craven was about to say 
something. “Now sir, I shall be able 
to find out where the other ship is 
heading. I know already that her 
Mannschenn Drive unit is not work- 
ing at full capacity; it sustained dam- 
age of some kind during during the 
action. I’m not a navigator, sir, but 
it seems to me that we could be 
waiting for her when she re-emerges 
into the normal Continuum.” 
“You’re not a navigator,” agreed 
Craven, “and you’re neither a tac- 
tician nor a strategist. We should 
look rather silly, shouldn’t we hang- 
ing in full view over a heavily for- 
tified naval base, a sitting duck. 
Even so . .” His big right hand 
stroked his beard. “Meanwhile, I’ll 
assume that our little friends are 
headed in the general direction of 
Waldegren and set course according- 
ly. If Mr. Grimes will be so good as 
to hunt up the target star in the 
Directory . 

G rimes did as he was told. He had 
made his protest, such as it 
was, and, he had to admit, he was in 
favor of continuing the battle. It 
was a matter of simple justice. Why 
should one shipload of murderers be 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



145 




destroyed and the other shipload es- 
cape unscathed? He was still more 
than a little dubious of the legality 
of it all, but he did not let it worry 
him. 

He helped Craven to line the ship 
upon the target star, a yellow, fifth 
magnitude spark. He manned the in- 
tercom while the captain poured on 
the acceleration and then, with the 
ship again falling free, cut in the 
Mannsohenn Drive. When the ves- 
sel was on course he expected that 
the old Man would give the usual 
order: “Normal Deep Space routine, 
Mr. Grimes. But this was not forth- 
coming. 

“Now,” said Craven ominously. 
“Now what , sir?” 

“You have a short memory, En- 
sign. A conveniently short memory, 
if I may say so. Mind you, I was 
favorably impressed by the way you 
handled your armament, but that has 
no bearing upon what happened be- 
fore.” 

Grimes blushed miserably. He 
knew what the captain was driving 
at. But, playing for time, he asked, 
“What do you mean, sir?” 

Craven exploded. “What do I 
mean? You have the crust to sit 
there and ask me that! Your snoop- 
ing, sir. Your violation of privacy. 
Even worse, your violation of the 
master’s privacy! I shall not tell Miss 
Pentecost; it would be unkind to em- 
barrass her. But . .” 

Grimes refrained from saying that 
he had seen Miss Pentecost wear- 
ing even less than when, inadvertent- 
ly, he had spied upon her. He mut- 
tered, “I can explain, sir.” 

“You’d better. Out with it.” 



“Well, sir, it was like this. I 
knew that we’d stumbled on the 
enemy — or that the enemy had 
stumbled upon us. I’d sounded Ac- 
tion Stations. And when you were 
a long time coming up to Control 
I thought that you must have hurt 
yourself, somehow . There have 
been such cases, as you know. So I 
thought I’d better check . .” 
“You thought . You thought. 
I’ll not say that you aren’t paid to 
think, because that’s just what an 
officer is paid for. But you didn’t 
think hard enough, or along the right 
lines.” Grimes could see that Craven 
had accepted his explanation and 
that all would be well. The captain’s 
full beard could not hide the begin- 
nings of a smile. “Did you ever hear 
of Sir Francis Drake, Ensign?” 
“No, sir.” 

“He was an admiral — one of 
Queen Elizabeth’s admirals. The 
first Elizabeth, of course. When the 
Spanish Armada was sighted he did 
not rush down to his flagship yelling 
‘Action Stations!’ He knew that there 
was time to spare, and so he quietly 
finished what he was doing before 
setting sail.” 

“And what was he doing, sir?” 
asked Grimes innocently. 

Craven glared at him, then 
snapped. “Playing bowls.” 

Then, suddenly, the tension was 
broken, and both men collapsed in 
helpless laughter. In part it was re- 
action to the strain of battle — but 
in greater part it was that free- 
masonry that exists only between 
members of the same sex, the 
acknowledgment of shared secrets 
and shared experiences. 



146 



IF 




Grimes knew that Jane Pentecost 
was not for him and wished Craven 
joy of her and she of the captain. 
Perhaps they had achieved a perma- 
nent relationship, perhaps not — but, 
either way, his best wishes were with 
them. 

Craven unbuckled his seat strap. 

“Deep Space routine, Mr. Grimes. 
It is your watch. I believe.” 

“Deep Space routine it is, sir.” 

Yes, it was still his watch (al- 
though so much had happened). It 
was still his watch, although there 
were barely fifteen minutes to go 
before relief. He was tired, more 
tired than he had ever been in his 
life before. He was tired, but not 
unhappy. He knew that the fact that 
he had killed men should be weigh- 
ing heavily upon his conscience — 
but it did not. They, themselves, had 
been killers — and they had had a 
far better chance than any of their 
own victims had enjoyed. 

He would shed no tears for them. 

XIX 

Craven came back to the control 
room at the change of watch, when 
Grimes was handing it over to Jane 
Pentecost. He waited until the rou- 
tine had been completed, then said, 
“We know where our friends are 
headed. They were, like us, ru nnin g 
for Waldegren — but they’re having 
to change course.” He laughed 
harshly. “There must be all hell let 
loose on their home planet.” 

“Why? What’s happened?” asked 
Grimes. 

“I’ll tell you later. But, first of 
all, we have an alteration of course 



ourselves. Look up Dartura in the 
Directory, will you, while I get the 
Drive shut down.” 

Epsilon Sextans was falling free 
through normal Space-Time before 
Grimes had found the necessary in- 
formation. And then there was the 
hunt for and the final identification 
of the target star, followed by the 
lining up by the use of the direc- 
tional gyroscopes. There was the 
brief burst of acceleration and then, 
the interstellar drive was cut in. 

The captain made a business of 
selecting and lighting a cigar. When 
the pungent combustion was well un- 
der way he said, “Our young Mr. 
Summers is a good snooper. Not 
as good as some people I know, 
perhaps . .” Grimes flushed, and 
Jane Pentecost looked puzzled. 

“He’s a super-sensitive. He let me 
have a full transcript of all the sig- 
nals, out and in. It took us a little 
time to get them sorted out — but 
not too long, considering. Adler — 
that’s the name of the surviving 
frigate — was running for home. 
Her captain sent a rather heavily 
edited report of the action to his 
admiral. It seems that Adler and 
the unfortunate Albatross were set 
upon and beaten up by a heavily 
armed Survey Service cruiser mas- 
querading as an innocent mechant- 
man. The Admiral, oddly enough, 
doesn’t want a squadron of Survey 
Service battlewagons laying nuclear 
eggs on his base. So Adler has been 
told to run away and lose herself 
until the flap’s over . .” 

“And did they send all that en 
clair?” demanded Grimes. “They 
must be mad!” 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



147 




“No, they aren’t mad. The sig- 
nal^ weren’t en clair” 

“But . ” 

“Reliable merchant captains/’ 
said Craven, “are often entrusted 
with highly confidential naval docu- 
ments: There were some such in my 
safe aboard Delta Orionis, consign- 
ed to the officer commanding Lin- 
disfame Base. The officer who de- 
livered them to me is an old friend 
and shipmate of mine, and he told 
me that among them was the com- 
plete psionic code used by the 
Waldegren Navy. Well, when I had 
decided to take over this ship, I’d 
have been a bloody fool not to have 
photostatted the whole damn is- 
sue. 

“So that’s the way of it. Herr 
Kapitan von Leidnitz thinks that he 
can say what he likes to his superiors 
without anybody else knowing what 
he’s saying. And all the while . .” 
Craven grinned wolfishly. “It seems 
that there’s a minor base, of sorts, 
on Dartura. Little more than repair 
yards, although I suppose that 
there’ll be a few batteries for their 
protection. I can imagine the sort 
of personnel they have running the 
show — passed-over commanders 
and the like, not overly bright. By 
the time that we get there we shall 
have concocted a convincing story 
— convincing enough to let us hang 
off in orbit until Adler appears on 
the scene. After all, we have their 
precious code. Why should they sus- 
pect us?” 

“Why shouldn’t we be AdlerT 
asked Grimes. 

“What do you mean, Ensign?” 

‘The Waldegren Navy’s frigates 



are almost identical, in silhouette, 
with the Commission’s Epsilon 
Class freighters. We could disguise 
this ship a little by masking the 
dissimilarities by a rough patching 
of plating. After all, Adler was in 
action and sustained some dam- 
age . 

“Complicated,” mused the cap- 
tain. “Too complicated. And two 
Adlers — each, presumably, in en- 
coded psionic communication with 
both Waldegren and Dartura . 
You’ve a fine, devious mind, young 
Grimes, but I’m afraid you’ve out- 
foxed yourself on that one.” 

4 6T et me talk, sir. Let me think 

I J out loud. To begin with, a 
ship running on Mannschenn Drive 
can put herself into orbit about a 
planet; but it’s not, repeat not, rec- 
ommended.” 

“Too bloody right it’s not.” 

“But we have the heels of Adler? 
Yes? Then we could afford a slight 
delay to carry out the modifications 
— the disguise — that I’ve sug- 
gested. After all, forty-odd light- 
years is quite a long way.” 

“But what do we gain, Mr. 
Grimes?” 

“The element of confusion, sir. 
Let me work it out. We disguise 
ourselves as well as we can. We find 
out, from intercepted and decoded 
signals, Adler f s ETA — and the co- 
ordinates of her break-through into 
the normal continuum. We contrive 
matters to be more or less in the 
same place at exactly the same time. 
And when the shore batteries and 
the guaidships see no less than two 
Adlers slugging it out, each of them 



148

yelling for help in the secret code, 
they won’t know which of us to 
open fire on.” 

“Grimes,” said Craven slowly, “I 
didn’t know you had it in you. All 
I can say is that I’m glad that 
you’re on our side.” 

“Am I?” asked Grimes wonder- 
ingly, suddenly deflated. He looked 
at die Captain who, after all, was 
little better than a pirate, whose 
accomplice he had become. He look- 
ed at the girl, but for whom he 
would not be here. “Am I? Damn 
it all, whose side am I on?” 

“You’d better go below,” Crav- 
en told him gently. “Go below and 
get some sleep. You need it. You’ve 
earned it.” 

“Jeremy,” said Jane Pentecost to 
Craven, “would you mind looking 
after the shop for half an hour or 
so? I’ll go with John.” 

“As you please, my dear. As you 
please.” 

“It was the assurance in the cap- 
tain’s voice that hurt. It won’t make 
any difference to us, it implied. It 
can’t make any difference. Sure , 
Jane , go ahead . Throw the nice little 
doggie a bone. We can spare it. 

“No thank you,” said Grimes 
coldly and left the control room. 

But he couldn’t hate these people. 

XX 

A fter a long sleep Grimes felt bet- 
ter. After a meal he felt better 
still. It was a good meal, even 
though the solid portion of it came 
from tins. Craven’s standards were 
slipping, thought the ensign. He was 
reasonably sure that such items as 



caviar, escargots, pate de foie gpas, 
Virginia ham, Brie, and remarkably 
alcoholic cherries were not included 
in the commission’s inventory of 
emergency stores. And neither 
would be the quite reasonable 
Montrachet, although it had lost a 
little by being decanted from its 
original bottles into standard squeeze 
bulbs. But if the captain had decided 
that the laborer was worthy of his 
hire, with the consignees of the 
cargo making their contribution 
towards that hire, that was his priv- 
ilege/responsiblility — call it what 
you will. 

Jane Pentecost watched him eat. 
As he was finishing his coffee she 
said, “Now that our young lion 'has 
fed, he is required in the Control 
Room.” 

He looked at her both gratefully 
and warily. “What have I done 
now?” 

“Nothing, my dear. It is to dis- 
cuss what you — we — will do. 
Next.” 

He followed her to Control. 
Craven was there, of course, and 
so were Baxter and Summers. The 
captain was enjoying one of his rank 
cigars, and a limp, roll-your-own 
cigarette dangled from the engineer’s 
lower lip. The telepath coughed 
pointedly every time that acrid 

smoke expelled by either man 

drifted his way. Neither paid any at- 
tention to him, and neither did 

Grimes when he filled and lit his 

own pipe. 

Craven said, “I’ve been giving 
that scheme of yours some thought. 
It’s a good one.” 

“Thank you, sir.” 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM

“Don’t thank me. I should thank 
you. Mr. Summers, here, has been 
maintaining a careful listening 
watch. Adler’s ETA is such that we 
can afford to shut down the Drive 
to make the modifications that you 
suggest. To begin with, we’ll fake 
patching plates with plastic sheets 
— we can’t afford to cannibalize 
any more of the ship’s structure — 
so as to obscure our name and iden- 
tification letters. We’ll use more 
plastic to simulate missile launchers 
and laser projectors; luckily there’s 
plenty of it in the cargo . .” 

“We found more than plastic 
while we were lookin’ for it,” said 
the engineer, licking his lips. 

“That will do, Mr. Baxter. Never, 
in normal cirmumstances, should I 
have condoned . .” 

“These circumstances ain’t nor- 
mal, Skipper, an’ we all bloody well 
know it.” 

“That will do, I say.” Craven in- 
haled deeply, then filled the air of 
the control room with a cloud of 
smoke that, thought Grimes, would 
have reflected laser even at close 
range. Summers almost choked, and 
Jane snapped, “Jeremy!” 

“This, my dear, happens to be my 
control room.” He turned again to 
the ensign. “It will not be necessary, 
Mr. Grimes, to relocate the real wea- 
pons. They functioned quite effici- 
ently where they are and, no doubt, 
will do so again. And now, as soon 
as I have shut down the Drive, I 
shall hand the watch over to you. 
You are well rested and refreshed.” 
“Come on,” said Jane to Baxter. 
“Let’s get suited up and get that 
sheeting out of the airlock.” 



“Couldn’t Miss Pentecost hold the 
fort, sir?” asked Grimes. He added, 
“I’ve been through the camouflage 
course at the Academy.” 

“And so have I, Mr. Grimes. 
Furthermore, Miss Pentecost has 
had experience in working outside, 
but I don’t think that you have.” 
“No, sir. But .' . .” 

“That will be all, Mr. Grimes.” 
At Craven’s orders the Drive was 
shut down, and outside the view- 
ports the sparse stars became stars 
again, were no longer pulsing spir- 
als of multicolored light. Then, 
alone in the control room, Grimes 
actuated his scanners so that he 
could watch the progress of the 
work outside the hull, switched on 
the transceiver that worked on the 
spacesuit frequency. 

This time he ran no risk of being 
accused of being a Peeping Tom. 

H e had to admire the competence 
with which his shipmates work- 
ed. 

The plastic sheeting had no mass 
to speak of, but it was awkward 
stuff to handle. Torches glowed 
redly as it was cut and radiated in- 
visibly in the infrared as it was 
shaped and welded. The workers, in 
their bulky, clumsy suits, moved 
with a grace that was in startling 
contrast to their attire — a Deep 
Space ballet, thought Grimes, pleas- 
urably surprised at his own way 
with words. From the speaker of 
the transceiver came Craven’s curt 
orders, the brief replies of the oth- 
ers. “This way a little . That’s 
it ” “She’ll do, Skipper ” “No she 
won’t. Look at the bend on itF 



150 



IF 




Then Jane’s laughing voice, ‘ Our 
secret weapon , Jeremy . A laser that 
fires round corners!” “That will do, 
Miss Pentecost . Straighten it, will 
you?” “Ay, ay, sir. Captain, sir” 
The two interstellar drive engineers 
were working in silence, but with 
efficiency. Aboard the ship were 
only Grimes and Summers, the tele- 
path. 

Grimes felt out of it, but some- 
body had to mind the shop, he sup- 
posed. But the likelihood of any 
customers was remote. 

Then he stiffened in his chair. 
One of the spacesuited figures was 
falling away from the vessel, drift- 
ing out and away, a tiny, glittering 
satellite reflecting the harsh glare of 
the working floods, a little, luminous 
butterfly pinned to the black velvet 
of the ultimate night. Who was it? 
He didn’t know for certain, but 
thought that it was Jane. The ship’s 
interplanetary drives — reaction and 
inertial — were on remote control, 
but reaction drive was out; before 
employing it he would have to swing 
to the desired heading by use of 
the directional gyroscopes. But the 
inertial drive was versatile. 

He spoke into the microphone of 
the transceiver. “Secure yourselves. 
I am proceeding to rescue.” 

At once Craven’s voice snapped 
back, “Hold it, Grimes. Hold it! 
There’s no danger.” 

“But, sir . .” 

“Hold it!” 

Grimes could see the distant fig- 
ure now from a viewpoint, but it 
did not seem to be receding any 
longer. Hastily he checked with the 
radar. Range and bearing were not 



changing. Then, with relative bear- 
ing unaltered, the range was closing. 
He heard Jane call out, “Got it! 
I’m on the way back!” 

Craven replied, “Make it snappy 
— otherwise young Grimes’ll be 
chasing you all over the universe!” 
Grimes could see, now, the lumi- 
nous flicker of a suit reaction unit 
from the lonely figure. 

Later, he and the others examined 
the photographs that Jane had taken. 

Epsilon Sextans looked as she was 
supposed to look, like a badly bat- 
tle-scarred frigate of the Waldegren 
Navy. 

XXI 

I n terms of Space and of Time 
there was not much longer to go. 
The two ships — one know- 
ing and one unknowing — raced 
towards their rendezvous. Had they 
been plunging through the normal 
continuum there would have been, 
towards the finish, hardly the thick- 
ness of a coat of paint between them, 
the adjustment of a microsecond in 
temporal precession rates would have 
brought inevitable collision. Craven 
knew this from the results of his 
own observations and from the en- 
coded position reports, sent at six 
hourly intervals, by Adler . Worried, 
he allowed himself to fall astern, a 
mere half kilometer. It would be 
enough — and, too, it would mean 
that the frigate would mask him 
from the fire of planetbased batter- 
ies. 

Summers maintained his listening 
watch. Apart from the position re- 
ports he had little of interest to tell 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM

IF 




the captain. Adler , once or twice 
had tried to get into contact with the 
main base on Waldegren; but, other 
then from a curt directive to proceed 
as ordered there were no signals 
from the planet to the ship. Dartura 
Base was more talkative. That was 
understandable. There was no colony 
on the planet, and the base person- 
nel must be bored, must be pining 
for the sight of fresh faces, the 
sound of fresh voices. They would 
have their excitement soon enough, 
promised Craven grimly. 

Through the warped continuum 
fell the two ships, and ahead the 
pulsating spiral that was the Dartura 
sun loomed ever brighter, ever larg- 
er. There were light-years yet to 
go, but the Drive-induced distor- 
tions made it seem that tentacles 
of incandescent gas were already 
reaching out to clutch them, to drag 
them into the atomic furnace at the 
heart of the star. 

In both control rooms, watch suc- 
ceeded watch; but the thoughts and 
the anticipations of the watchkeep- 
ers were not the same. Aboard 
Adler there was the longing for rest, 
for relaxation — although Adler's 
captain must have been busy with 
the composition of a report that 
would clear him (if possible) of 
blame for his defeat. Aboard Epsi- 
lon Sextans there was the anticipa- 
tion of revenge — insofar as Cra- 
ven, Baxter, Jane Pentecost and the 
survivors of the ship’s original per- 
sonnel were concerned. Grimes? As 
the hour of reckoning approached 
he was more and more dubious. He 
did not know what to think, what 
to feel. There was the strong per- 



THE ROAD TO THE R!M 



153 




sonal loyalty to Craven — and, even 
now, to Jane Pentecost. There was 
the friendship and mutual respect 
that had come into being between 
himself and Baxter. There was the 
knowledge that Adler's crew were 
no better than pirates, were mur- 
derers beyond rehabilitation. There 
was the pride he felt in his own 
skill as a gunnery officer. (But, as 
such, was he, himself, any better 
than a pirate, a murderer? The ex- 
ercise of his craft aboard a warship 
would be legal — but here, aboard 
a merchantman, and a disguised 
merchantman at that, the legality 
was doubtful. What had his motives 
been when he volunteered — and 
as a commissioned officer of the Sur- 
vey Service he had had no right to 
do so — what were his motives now?) 

He, Grimes, was not happy. He 
had far too much time to ponder 
the implications. He was an ac- 
cessory before, during and after the 
fact. He had started off correctly 
enough, when he had tried to pre- 
vent Craven from requisitioning the 
Survey Service cargo aboard Delta 
Orionis , but after that . After he 
and Jane . (That, he admitted, was 
a memory that he wanted to keep, 
always, just as that other memory, 
of the bright picture of naked fe- 
male flesh on the screen, he wished 
he could lose forever.) 

He had started off correctly 
enough — and then, not only had 
he helped install the purloined arma- 
ment but had used it. ( And used it 
well , he told himself with a brief 
resurgence of pride.) Furthermore, 
the disguise of Epsilon Sextans had 
been his idea. 



Oh, he was in it, all right. He 
was in up to the neck. What the 
final outcome of it all would be 
he did not care to contemplate. 

But it would soon be over. He 
had no fears as to the outcome of 
the 'battle. The element of surprise 
would be worth at least a dozen 
missile launchers. Adler would never 
have the chance to use her laser. 

A dler , reported Summers, had 
shut down her Mannschenn 
Drive and emerged briefly into 
normal Space-Time to make her 
final course adjustment. She was 
now headed not for the Dartura Sun 
but for the planet itself — or where 
the planet would be at the time of 
her final — and fatal — re-emer- 
gence into the continuum. The last 
ETA was sent, together with the co- 
ordinates of her planetfall. Epsilon 
Sextans made her own course ad- 
justment — simultaneity in Time and 
a half kilometer’s divergence in Space 
being Craven’s objective. It was 
finicky work, even with the use of 
the ship’s computer, but the captain 
seemed satisfied. 

The race — the race that would 
culminate in a dead heat — con- 
tinued. Aboard the frigate there was, 
reported Summers, a lessening of 
tension, the loosening up that comes 
when a voyage is almost over. 
Aboard the merchantman the ten- 
sion increased. The interstellar drive 
engineers, Grimes knew, were no 
happier about it all than he was — 
but they could no more back out 
than he could. Craven was calm and 
confident, and Baxter was beginning 
to gloat. Jane Pentecost assumed 



154 



IF 




the air of dedication that in women 
can be so infuriating. Grimes glum- 
ly checked and rechecked his wea- 
ponry. It passed the time. 

Dartura itself was visible now — 
not as tiny disc of light, but as a 
glowing annulus about its distorted 
primary. The thin ring of lumines- 
cence broadened, broadened. The 
time to go dwindled to a week, to 
days, to a day, and then to hours . 

To minutes . 

To seconds . 

Craven and Grimes were in the 
control room, the others were at 
their various stations. From the in- 
tercom came the telepath’s voice, 
“He’s cutting the Drive . .” 

“Out the Drive!” ordered the 
Captain. 

In the Mannschenn Drive room 
the spinning, precessing gyroscopes 
slowed, slowed, ceased their endless 
tumbling, assumed the solidity that 
they exhibited only when at rest. 
For perhaps two seconds there was 
temporal confusion in the minds of 
all on board as the precession field 
died, Past, Present and Future in- 
extricably mingled. Then there was 
a gun glaring through the view- 
ports, bright in spite of the polari- 
zation — a sun, and, directly ahead, 
a great, green-orange planet. There 
was a ship . 

There were ships — ahead of 
them, astern, on all sides. 

There were ships — and, booming 
from the intership transceiver, the 
transceiver that was neither tuned 
nor switched on (but navies could 
afford induction transmitters with 
their fantastic power consumption) 
came the authorative voice, “Inflex- 



ible to Adler! Heave to for search 
and seizure! Do not attempt to es- 
cape, our massed fields will hold 
you!” 

The effect was rather spoiled 
when the same voice added, in be- 
wilderment, “Must be seeing double. 
There’s two of the bastards . .” 
The bewilderment did not last long. 
“Inflexible to Adler and to uniden- 
tified vessel. Heave to for search 
and seizure!” 

“Hold your fire, Mr. Grimes,” 
ordered Craven, quietly and bitter- 
ly. “It’s the Survey Service.” 

“I know,” replied Grimes — and 
pressed the button. 

XXH 

H e never knew just why he had 
had done so. 

Talking it over afterwards, think- 
ing about it, he was able to evolve 
a theory that fitted the facts. Dur- 
ing that brief period immediately 
after the shutting down of the Drive, 
during the short session of temporal 
disorientation, there had been pre- 
science, of a sort. He had known 
that Adler, come what may, would 
attempt one last act of defiance and 
revenge, just as Adler's captain or 
Gunnery Officer must have known, 
in that last spit second, that Nemesis 
was treading close upon his heels. 

He pushed the button — and from 
the nozzles in the shell plating pour- 
ed the reflective vapor, the protec- 
tive screen that glowed , ruddily as 
Adler's lasers slashed out at it. 

From the speaker of the dead 
transceiver, the transceiver that 
should have been dead, roared the 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



155 




voice of the Survey Service admiral. 
“Adler! Cease fire! Cease fire, damn 
you!” There was a pause, then — 
“You’ve asked for it!” 

She had asked for it and now 
she got it. Suddenly the blip on 
Grimes’ screen that represented the 
Waldegren frigate became two small- 
er blips, and then four. The roiling 
fog outside Epsilon Sextans* view- 
ports lost its luminosity, faded sud- 
denly to drab grayness. The voice 
from the transceiver said coldly, 
“And now you whoever you are, had 
better identify yourself. And fast.” 
Craven switched on the communi- 
cations equipment. He spoke quitely 
into the microphone. “Interstellar 
Transport Commission’s Epsilon Sex- 
tans. Bound Waverley, with general 
cargo . 

“Bound Waverley? Then what the 
hell are you doing here? And what’s 
that armament you’re mounting?” 
“Plastic,” replied the captain. 
“Plastic dummies.” 

“And I suppose your ALGE is 
plastic, too. Come off it, Jerry. 
We’ve already boarded your old 
ship, and although your ex-Mate 
was most reluctant to talk we got a 
story of sorts from him.” 

“I thought I recognized your 
voice, Bill. May I congratulate you 
upon your belated efforts to stamp 
out piracy?” 

“And may I deplore your deter- 
mination to take the law into your 
own hands? Stand by for the board- 
ing party.” 

G rimes looked at Craven, who 
was slumped in his seat. The 
master’s full beard effectively 



masked his expression. “Sir,” asked 
the ensign. “What can they do? 
What will they do?” 

“You’re the space lawyer, Grimes. 
You’re the expert on Survey Serv- 
ice rules and regulations. What will 
it be, think you? A medal — or a 
firing squad? Praise or blame?” 
“You know the admiral, sir?” 
“Yes. I know the admiral. We’re 
old shipmates.” 

“Then you should be safe.” 

“Safe? I suppose so. Safe from 
the firing squad, but not safe from 
my employers. I’m a merchant cap- 
tain, Grimes, and merchant cap- 
tains aren’t supposed to range the 
spacelanes looking for trouble. I 
don’t think they’ll dare fire me; 
but I know that never can I expect 
command of anything better than 
Delta Class ships, on the drearier 
runs. 

Grimes saw that Craven was smil- 
ing. “But there’s still the Rim 
Worlds. There’s still the Sundowner 
Line, and the chance of high rank 
in the Rim Worlds Navy when and 
if there is such a service.” 

“You have . inducements, sir?” 
“Yes. There are . inducements.” 
“I thought, once,” said Grimes, 
“that I could say the same. But not 
now. Not any longer. Even so . 
I’m Survey Service, sir, and I should 
be proud of my service. But in this 
ship, this merchant vessel, with her 
makeshift armament, we fought 
against heavy odds, and won. And, 
just now, we saved ourselves. It 
wasn’t the Survey Service that saved 
us.” 

“Don’t be disloyal,” admonished 
Craven. 



156 



IF 




“I’m not being disloyal, sir. But 
... Or, shall we say, I'm being 
loyal. You’re the first captain under 
whom I served under fire. If you’re 
going out to the Rim Worlds I’d 
like to come with you.” 

“Your Commission, Grimes. You 
know that you must put in ten years’ 
service before resignation is possi- 
ble.” 

“But I’m dead.” 

“Dead?" 

“Yes. Don’t you remember I was 
snooping around in the Mannschenn 
Drive room, and I got caugjit in 
the temporal precession field. My 
body still awaits burials; it’s in a 
sealed metal box in the deep freeze. 
It can never be identified . .” 
Craven laughed. “I’ll say this for 
you. You’re ingenious. But how do 
we account for the absence of the 
late Mr. Wolverton? And your pres- 
ence aboard this drip . .” 

“I can hide, sir, and . .” 

“And while you’re hiding you'll 
concoct some story that will explain 
everything. Oh Grimes, Grimes . 
You’re an officer I wish I could al- 
ways have with me. But I’ll not stand 
in the way of your career. All I can 
do, all I will do, is smooth things 
over on your behalf with the admiral. 
I should be able to manage that.” 

J ane Pentecost emerged from the 
hatch in the control room deck. 
Addressing Craven she said formal- 
ly, “Admiral Williams, sir.” She 
moved to one side to make way for 
the flag officer. 

“Jerry, you bloody pirate!” boom- 
ed Williams, a squat, rugged man 
the left breast of whose shirt was 



ablaze with ribbons. He advanced 
with outstretched hand. 

“Glad to have you aboard, Bill. 
This is Liberty Hall — you can 
spit on the mat and call the cat a 
bastard!” 

“Not again!” groaned Grimes. 
“And who is this young man?” 
asked the admiral. 

“I owe you — or your Service — 
an apology, Bill. This is Ensign 
Grimes, who was a passenger aboard 
Delta Orionis. I’m afraid that I . 
er . press-ganged him into my 
service. But he has been most . 
cooperative? Uncooperative? Which 
way do you want it?” 

“As we are at war with Waldegren 
— I’d say cooperative, with reser- 
vations. Was it he, by the way, who 
used the ALGE? Just as well for 
you all that he did.” 

“At war with Waldegren?” de- 
manded Jane Pentecost. “So you 
people have pulled your fingers out 
at last.” 

The admiral raised his eyebrows. 
“One of my Rim Worlders,” ex- 
plained Craven. “But I shall be a 
Rim Worlder myself shortly.” 

“You’re wise, Jerry. I’ve got the 
buzz that the Commission is taking 
a very dim view of your piracy or 
privateering or whatever it was, and 
my own Lords and Masters are far 
from pleased with you. You’d better 
get the hell out before the lawyers 
have decided just what crimes you 
are guility of.” 

“As bad as that?” 

“As bad as that.” 

“And young Grimes, here?” 
“We’ll take him back. Six months’ 
strict discipline aboard my flagship 



THE ROAD TO THE RIM 



157 




will undo all the damage that you 
and your ideas have done to him. 
And now, Jerry, I’d like your full 
report.” 

“In my cabin, Bill. Talking is 
thirsty work.” 

“Then lead on. It’s your ship.” 

“And it’s your watch, Mr. Grimes. 
She’ll come to no harm on this tra- 
jectory while we get things sorted 
out.” 

G rimes sat with Jane Pentecost in 
the control room. Through the 
ports, had he so desired, he could 
have watched the rescue teams ex- 
tricating the survivors from the 
wreckage of Adler , he could have 
stared out at the looming bulk of 
Dartura on the beam. But he did 
not do so, and neither did he look 
at his instruments. 

He looked at Jane. There was so 
much about her that he wanted to re- 
member — and, after all, so very 
little that he was determined to for- 
get. 

The intercom buzzed. “Mr. 
Grimes, will you pack whatever gear 



you have and prepare to transfer 
with Admiral Williams to the flag- 
ship? Hand the watch over to Miss 
Pentecost.” 

“But you’ll be shorthanded, sir.” 
“The admiral is lending me a 
couple of officers for the rest of the 
voyage.” 

“Very good, sir.” 

Grimes made no move. He looked 
at Jane — a somehow older, tireder, 
a more human Jane than the girl 
he had first met. He said, “I’d have 
liked to come out to the Rim with 
you . .” 

She said, “It’s impossible, John.” 
“I know. But . .” 

“You’d better get packed.” 

He unbuckled his seat belt, went 
to where she was sitting. He kissed 
her. She responded, but it was only 
the merest flicker of a response. 

He said, “Good-by.” 

She said, “Not good-by. We’ll see 
you out on the Rim, sometime.” 
With a bitterness that he was al- 
ways to regret he replied, “Not 
bloody likely.”

Dear Editor: 

This is the first time I have writ- 
ten your magazine (or any other!) 
but since If is a Hugo winner I 
suppose it is the logical place to 
start. 

The strong points of If are the 
serialized novels and the Gree, Re- 
tief, Berserker and Niven series. In 
the first category you have pub- 
lished, in 1966, two first-class nov- 
els, The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress 
by Heinlein (best thing ever pub- 
lished in //) and Earthblood by 
Brown and Laumer, as well as three 
other good serials. 

To top this off, the editorials, 
O.M.I.F., and HAC are three of the 
best features of any magazine. 
All of these, especially O.M.I.F. 
deserve to be increased in length. 
A book reviewer of Budrys's caliber 
— del Rey or Leiber perhaps — is 
badly needed for If. The only mag- 
azine science writer I like is Asi- 
mov, although Ley's books are QX. 
As a special feature could you give 
a bibliography of Heinlein's work? 

If anyone reading this knows of 
a chess association of SF fans (or 
would like to form one), please drop 
me a line. Same with a group of 
Heinlein devotees.

♦ * * 

Dear Editor: 

Just a belated letter in tribute to 
your creative genius. Your editorial 
on pictures from computers really 
fascinated me! So logical, so origi- 
nal, so true — for a non-program 
mer to invent. 

You should now be informed that 
this cartooning sort of thing is very 
definitely ‘‘old-hat" in the field of 
computer programming. Especially, 
in the field of military-computer 
programming, where various sym- 
bols and diagrams must be strate- 
gically placed upon various scopes, 
in proper alignment. 

An excellent example is the “or- 
ientation” program for the Sage 
System Defense Computer network. 
When more information (detail) is 
desired of a certain spot on the 
scope, a so-called “light-gun” is 
aimed at that spot, and activates 
an auxiliary detail-information pro- 
gram sequence. Now, strictly for the 
visitation of very high brass and 



159 




civilians, this “orientation” pro- 
gram has a topless belly dancer 
swinging a mean grass skirt. And 
when you fire the light-gun at her 
navel, off drops the grass skirt! 

Since that program, and the other 
information above, is unclassified, 
it is legal for me to tell you about 
it. I wonder whether I should also 
tell you that I was told — by an 
executive — that it cost about $20,- 
000 of taxpayers’ money to write 
and check out that “orientation” 
program? This was done 10 or 
more years ago. 

Certainly, programming is cheap- 
er than stage shows and movies. 
The main reason is because pro- 
grammers are cheaper to hire than 
actors, stagehands, props, etc. How- 
ever, large sums of money are still 
required, since checkout can be very 
time-consuming — and machine-time 
is very expensive, at least on the 
large computers. 

However, the process of micro- 
miniaturization of electronic com- 
ponents should, eventually, reduce 
the prices of large-scale, high-speed 
ligital computers. 

Incidentally, I was told that 
“DOTTTE,” the $20,000 bellydancer, 
was available only at the original 
programming contractor’s location 
— and NOT at any of the various 
computer sites around the country. 

On second thought, let’s not print 
this letter. Let’s just keep it at the 
level of information for you. OK? 

I have enjoyed your stories, and 
your magazines, for many years 
now. But I am selective! I browse 
through any magazine sci-fi or 
otherwise, before I decide whether 
or not to buy that particular issue. 
# We didn’t want to keep this valu- 
able bit of information from you, 
so we coaxed the author of the 



above to let us publish it, and he 
agreed — providing we didn’t give 
his name 1 — Editor . 

* * ♦ 

Dear Editor: 

May I make a suggestion? Each 
month you publish a First that has 
never seen print before. Often it is 
easy to pick out the first, because, 
all the other writers you’ve seen be- 
fore. This is not always true. Could 
you possibly include this on the 
page where the story starts? Say 
the top right comer, opposite the 
“short story” or whatever? 

Talking of firsts, if I’m not mis- 
taken, On the Shallow Seas was the 
first for January ’67. I think that 
it is one of the best you’ve printed 
so far and you’ve printed some good 
ones in ’66. There was Steve Bu- 
chanan, H. H. Hollis, A. A. Walde 
and Gardner Raymond Dozois. All 
of them from good to great. 

I’m glad to see that Budrys decid- 
ed to come back and write some more 
and if his new novel is as good all 
the way through (I have no doubt 
that it is) as the first part, he’ll 
have next year’s Hugo all but 
wrapped up. 

Which brings me to the congrat- 
ulations. You deserved that Hugo, 
and I’m betting on you having it 
ten years at least, or do you think 
Galaxy might grab it? 

By the way, when are you going 
to bring us Rogue Star? If not soon 
then I would suggest you write a 
story and (get it printed fast — if 
there’s one thing this mag lacks, 
it’s stories by you! — Nick Grim- 
shawe, R. R. #2, Alliston, Ontario, 
Canada. 

% Principal reason we don’t identi- 
fy “First” stories at the beginning 
of the stories themselves is that we 
feel they must compete for your at-

tention with the other stories by 
the regular professionals — other- 
wise we have no business printing 
them. But there's something to be 
said for the other way, too, and 
maybe we ought to try it for a 
while . Rogue Star (it now 
seems) will start in the July issue 
of If. Hope it's been worth waiting 
for ! — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

Re Mensa, I found William Tur- 
ner's letter quite disturbing. Are the 
members so sure they are not the 
bottom 2% of the population in in- 
telligence? If a man gifted with 
superior intelligence feels he is a 
misfit, is his intelligence really su- 
perior? If he has so much intelli- 
gence he should be able to live \yith 
his inferiors with little problem. 
The “lonely heads" club really has 
no reason_to be in existence. 

I appreciate any personal corres- 
pondence from readers. — Ronald 
Weintstock, 20 Sunset Road, Law- 
rence, New York 11559.

Dear Editor: 

As a long-time RAH fan, I was 
amused to notice a little point at the 
end of “The Moon . Manuel 
makes reference to a member of 
the family, named Hazel, who 
changes her name to Stone, Hazel 
Stone. Well, long ago RAH wrote 
a novel — one of his “juveniles", 
called The Rolling Stones, in which 
the main character was an old wom- 
an named Hazel Stone — and she 
was an engineer who lived on the 
moon. I wonder how many of your 
readers caught this. 

Anyway, I hope that there will 
be many more Heinlein serials in If; 
many, many more. 



And while I'm writing, two other 
things. 

First, a complaint about your 
covers. They never seem to change, 
and they always look like so methin g 
from “SUPER-DUPER WHIZ 
BANG BLOOD AND GUTS AC- 
TION STORIES OF THE SPACE- 
LANES". And then inside, a lot of 
complaints about critics not taking 
SF seriously. No wonder! 

Secondly, a question. I imagine 
that every fan who's been a fan 
for more than a year has heard or 
read the phrase “The Music of the 
Spheres". Have you any idea whence 
this haunting term came? — Brian 
Kappler, 224 Buckingham Drive, 
Windsor, Ontario, Canada. 

# We turned your question over to 
the eminent classicist Miss Judy- 
Lynn Benjamin, B.A., noted author 
of various monographs and papers, 
editor of the recent and penetrating 
critique of James Joyce's Ulysses, 
The Celtic Bull, etc., and our es- 
teemed Associate Editor. Says Ju- 
dy-Lynn: “Pythagoras, having as- 
certained that the pitch of notes 
depends on the rapidity of vibra- 
tion, and also observing that the 
planets move at different velocities 
through the heavens, concluded that 
each planet must make a sound in 
its motion according to its speed; 
and, as all* things in nature are 
harmoniously made, the different 
sounds must harmonize. Plato went 
a step farther by stating that a 
siren must sit on each planet, car- 
olling a sweet song, agreeing to the 
motion of her own particular planet 
yet harmonizing with all the others." 
So much for the classical view. 
Since the beginning of radio-tele- 
scopy the “sounds" — i.e., the radio 
waves, which can be read-out as 
audible frequencies as well as any-

thing else — of various radio-emit- 
ting ^heavenly bodies is sometimes 
called “the music of the spheres.” 
Only thing wrong, it ain't harmon- 
ious! (Sounds like squeaks, hums, 
putt-putts and squeals.) — Editor .

Dear Editor: 

I, and I suppose a multitude of 
science-fiction fans, want to thank 
you for drawing our attention to the 
proposed cancellation of the TV 
show “Star Trek”. For the very 
first time in my life I sat down and 
wrote to a network (and an editor) 
to protest having a show taken off 
the air. Not that I have any doubt 
of the outcome of it all: The show 
will be cancelled, the way the rat- 
ing-game is played. 

It would be gratifying if you 
could suggest to the writers who con- 
tributed to the scripts to put them 
into book-form. As you probably 
know, there is an adaption of “Star- 
Trek” episodes by James Blish on 
the bookstands, a very poor one. It 
is one of the rare instances in which 
a book is far inferior to the show 
which bears its name. Characteriza- 
tion is non-existent, the relationship 
of the three main characters toward 
each other, which makes the show 
so enjoyable and which, I am sure, 
is the interpretation intended by the 
original authors, and which is one of 
friendship, respect, loyalty and sub- 
tle humor, are completely forgotten 
and ignored in the book version. It 
is quite unbelievable, as the book 
has it, that the commander of a 
starship, who spends years in space 
to find new civilizations, should feel 
uneasy and kind of patronizingly 
amused at the different ways his 
alien first officer has. Why spend 



all that time in space, if you expect 
to find exactly everything as on 
Earth? Quite illogical and very 
provincial. 

There is another point which the 
show also raises, but which I dis- 
missed as nitpicking in view of the 
overall excellence of the show, but 
which is very irritating in the book: 
The supposed absence of any and 
all emotions in Vulcans. There just 
is no such thing, anyone like that 
is a robot. Loyalty, friendship, in- 
tegrity, courage — all of these at- 
tributes Mr. Spock possesses — are 
emotions. And Mr. Spock is sup- 
posed to be the offspring of a Vul- 
can father and a human mother, so 
somebody must have loved some- 
one at some time. 

I would love to see “Star Trek” 
in book form, written by writers who 
know their craft. — Mrs. Fred Wit- 
ten, 41-09 41st Street, Long Island 
City 4, New York.

Dear Editor: 

I request that you or one of your 
readers help me. Do you or your 
readers know of any group prepar- 
ing for the day when it will be 
possible to establish either on the 
Moon or under the sea a society or 
a group of societies which will be 
more or less independent of those 
which now exist? Does anyone have 
any practical plans to produce a 
good or perfect society in the near 
future? (I do not include L.B.J.) — 
Patrick J. Kelly, Jr., 121 South 
Wickham Road, Baltimore, Mary- 
land 21229. 

# That does it for another month. 
This issue’s “First” story is by B. 
K. Filer. We think you’ll be seeing 
him again! — THE EDITOR
