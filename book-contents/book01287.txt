Do You Lau gh 
Your Greatest 
Powers Away? 

THOSE STRANGE 
INNER URGES 

You have heard the phrase; 
"Laugh, clown, laugh.” Well, that 
fits me perfectly. I’d fret, worry 
and try to reason my way out of 
difficulties— all to no avail; then 
I’d have a hunch, a something 
within that would tell me to do 
a certain thing. I’d laugh it off 
with a shrug. I knew too much, I 
thought, to heed these impress 
sions. Well, it’s different now— 
I've learned to use this inner power 
and I no longer make the mis- 
takes I did, because I do the right 
thing at the right time. 

This FREE BOOK Will Prove 
What Your Mind Can Do! 

Here is how I got started right: 
I had heard about hypnosis reveal- 
ing past lives. I began to think 
there must be some inner intelli- 
gence with which we were born. 
In fact, I often heard it said there 





was; but how could I use it, how 
could I make it work for me daily? 
That was my problem: I wanted 
to learn to direct this inner voice; 
master it if I could. Finally, I wrote 
to the Rosicrucians, a world-wide 
fraternity of progressive men and 
women, who offered to send me, 
without obligation, a free book 
entitled The Mastery of Life. 

That book opened a new world 
to me. I advise you to write today 
and ask for your copy. It will prove 
to you what your mind can demon- 
strate. Don’t go through life 
laughing your mental powers 
away. Simply write: Scribe J.F.W,

THE 

WORLDS 

OF SCIENCE 



J UST at press time, we re- 
ceived a package in the mail 
and found it of such imme- 
diate interest that we empty 
it herewith into your lap. 
Brevity is the soul of speed. 
These short notes can’t begin 
to do full justice to THE 
WORLDS OF SCIENCE, a 
handsome new series from 
Pyramid. Six books have been 
released at this writing. They 
are : 

THE HUMAN BRAIN, by 
John Pfeiffer. This a general 
reader’s study of the brain, 
what it is, how it works, how 
it goes wrong and what can 
be done about it when it does. 
The author has an engaging 
style, running strongly to il- 
lustrative anecdote. Some of 
this material is really fas- 
cinating, such as the minute 
description of the stereotaxic 
surgery techniques which are 
replacing lobotomies, and 
such as-yet-unexplained phe- 
nomena as the fact that 
“Wizard-of-Oz” (i.e., green) 
eyeglasses can prevent certain 



types of epileptic seizures, 
and that in many cases blood 
tests can indicate psychotic 
“explosions” before they oc- 
cur. 

MAYA, by Charles Gallen- 
kamp. Photographs, most by 
the author. For many years 
the rise and fall of the rich 
and highly-developed Mayan 
empire, which reached its 
peak more than a thousand 
years ago, has been regarded 
as an “impenetrable” mys- 
tery. The penetration of it 
reads like the most exciting 
of detective stories, which of 
course it is. Mr. Gallenkamp 
writes like a lover (well, per- 
haps more clear-eyed than 
that!) on Maya in particular 
and archaeology in general, so 
that one gets, as a sort of side 
bonus, generous helpings of 
the history and techniques of 
this entrancing field of work, 
and also of its value ; for 
archaeology, especially of iso- 
lated cultures, helps immeas- 
urably in the understanding 
of the anatomy of civilization. 

5 





This book goes back to the 
dim origins of Maya, follows 
it to its heights, studies its 
religion and daily life, its 
cataclysmic collision with the 
Spaniards and its still mys- 
terious extinction. 

NINE PLANETS* by Alan E. 
Nourse. Many line cuts, and a 
section of Mel Hunter paint- 
ings. A glance through this 
marvelous (a word here care- 
fully chosen) book makes one 
wonder if Nourse is soaked 
in sf or sf writers soaked in 
Nourse. Here in clear logical 
explication are such fan’s de- 
lights as the “brightside cross- 
ing” of Mercury, asteroid 
mining, the possibility of arti- 
facts on cosmic debris and 
many, many more. The author 
takes off from the earliest re- 
corded yarns of space-flight, 
goes on to the birth and na- 
ture of the sun and the plan- 
etary system, and then sub- 
jects each of the planets to as 
thorough an examination as 
his great erudition and pow- 
erful imagination can give. 
He concludes with a chapter 
on solar systems beyond the 
sun and two appendices, one 
on comparative statistics, the 
other a glossary. 

LIVING EARTH, by Peter 
Farb. If you had the inde- 
scribable experience of being 
hooked, as a child, by Henri 
Fabre or Maeterlinck, you 
will certainly find in this 
book the growing excitement 
which promises you a similar 

6 



delight. For Farb has a 
similar gift: the ability to ob- 
serve acutely, describe ac- 
curately — and write like a 
poet. "The slime mold moves, 
not like a four-footed beast, 
but like a one-celled pro- 
tozoan. It ventures out of the 
soil and migrates at the pace 
of a slug to exposed positions 
on rocks and logs. There, in 
only a few hours, the slimy 
mass transforms itself into a 
bouquet of fantastic flowers 
— wispy things on slender 
stalks, clusters of exotic blos- 
soms, puffballs, colored cups, 
toadstools. The animal has 
become a plant, one of the 
most beautiful objects of the 
soil.” This is a book — possibly 
the only book — about life in 
the soil, and it covers a stag- 
gering amount of information 
on extremely diverse fields. 

CHEMISTRY CREATES A 
NEW WORLD. If you know 
no more about chemistry than 
how to spell it, Jaffe will 
competently take you through 
a definition of it, a survey 
of the whole field, its history 
and its symbols; and finally 
to an item-by-item examina- 
tion of certain broad special- 
ties in which new worlds are 
coming to light: medicines, 
foods, metals, synthetic gaso- 
line and rubber and fibers, 
new elements, and atomic en- 
ergy. By the time he’s done 
with you, you will take far 
less for granted those nylon 
socks, that wormless apple, 
that tire that waited for 




24,000 miles before its first finally, From Instinct to

T HE pole stars of the other 
planets cluster around Po- 
laris and Octans, but Uranus 
spins on a snobbishly differ- 
ent axis between Aldebaran 
and Antares. The Bull is her 
coronet and the Scorpion her 
footstool. Dear blowzy old 
bitch-planet, swollen and pale 
and cold, mad with your 
Shakespearean moons, white- 
mottled as death from Vener- 
ean Plague, spinning on your 
side like a poisoned pregnant 
cockroach, rolling around the 
sun like a fat drunken floozie 
with green hair rolling on the 
black floor of an infinite bar- 
room, what a sweet last view 
of the Solar System you are 
for a cleancut young space- 
man . 



Grunfeld chopped off that 
train of thought short. He was 
young and the First Interstel- 
lar War had snatched him up 
and now it was going to pitch 
him and twenty other Joes out 
of the System on a fast curve 
breaking around Uranus — and 
so what! He shivered to get 
a little heat and then applied 
himself to the occulted star he 
was tracking through Pros- 
pers bridge telescope. The 
star was a twentieth planetary 
diameter into Uranus, the 
crosslines showed — a glint al- 
most lost in pale green. That 
meant its light was bulleting 
1600 miles deep through the 
seventh planet's thick hydro- 
gen atmosphere, unless he 
were seeing the star on a

mirage trajector y — and at 
least its depth agreed with the 
time since rim contact. 

At 2000 miles he lost it. 
That should mean 2000 miles 
plus of hydrogen soup above 
the methane ocean, an Amer- 
ica-wide layer of gaseous 
gunk for the captain to play 
the mad hero in with the fleet. 

Grunfeld didn’t think the 
captain wanted to play the 
mad hero. The captain hadn’t 
gone space-simple in any ob- 
vious way like Croker and 
Ness. And he wasn’t, like 
Jackson, a telepathy-racked 
visionary entranced by the 
Enemy. Worry and responsi- 
bility had turned the captain’s 
face into a skull which floated 
in Grunfeld’s imagination 
when he wasn’t actually see- 
ing it, but the tired eyes deep- 
sunk in the dark sockets were 
still cool and perhaps sane. 
But because of the worry the 
captain always wanted to have 
the last bit of fact bearing on 
the least likely maneuver, and 
two pieces of evidence were 
better than one. Grunfield 
found the next sizable star 
due to occult. Five-six min- 
utes to rim contact. He float- 
ed back a foot from the tele- 
scope, stretching out his thin 
body in the plane of the eclip- 
tic — strange how he automat- 
ically assumed that orienta- 
tion in free fall! He blinked 
and blinked, then rested his 
eyes on the same planet he'd 
been straining them on. 

The pale greenish bulk of 
Uranus was centered in the 



big bridge spaceshield against 
the black velvet dark and bay- 
onet-bright stars, a water- 
splotched and faded char- 
treuse tennis ball on the dia- 
mond-spiked bed of night. At 
eight million miles she looked 
half the width of Luna seen 
from Earth. Her whitish equa- 
torial bands went from bottom 
to top, where, Grunfeld knew, 
they were spinning out of 
sight at three miles a second 
— a gelid waterfall that he 
imagined tugging at him with 
ghostly green gangrenous fin- 
gers and pulling him over into 
a hydrogen Niagara. 

Half as wide as Luna. But 
in a day she’d overflow the 
port as they whipped past her 
on a near miss and in another 
day she’d be as small as this 
again, but behind them, sun- 
ward, having altered their 
outward course by some small 
and as yet unpredictable an- 
gle, but no more able to slow 
Prospero and her sister ships 
or turn them back at their 100 
miles a second than the fleet’s 
solar jets could operate at this 
chilly distance from Sol. G’by, 
fleet. G’by, C.C.Y. spaceman. 

G runfeld looked for the 

pale planet’s moons. Mi- 
randa and Umbriel were too 
tiny to make disks, but he dis- 
tinguished Ariel four diame- 
ters above the planet and 
Oberon a dozen below. Spec- 
tral sequins. If the fleet were 
going to get a radio signal 
from any of them, it would 
have to be Titania, occulted

now by the planet and the 
noisy natural static of her 
roiling hydrogen air and 
seething methane seas — but it 
had always been only a faint 
hope that there were survivors 
from the First Uranus Expe- 
dition. 

Grunfeld relaxed his neck 
and let his gaze drift down 
across the curving star-bor- 
dered forward edge of Pros - 
pero*s huge mirror and the 
thin jutting beams of the port 
lattice arm to the dim red-lit 
gages below the spaceshield. 

Forward Skin Temperature 
seven degrees Kelvin. Almost 
low enough for helium to 
crawl, if you had some heli- 
um. Prospero f s insulation, 
originally designed to hold 
out solar heat, was doing a 
fair job in reverse. 

Aft (sunward) Skin Tem- 
perature 75 degrees Kelvin. 
Close to that of Uranus’ sun- 
lit face. Check. 

Cabin Temperature 43 de- 
grees Fahrenheit. Brr! The 
Captain was a miser with the 
chem fuel remaining. And 
rightly... if it were right to 
drag out life as long as pos- 
sible in the empty icebox be- 
yond Uranus.

zero. Many other zeros. 

The four telltales for the 
fleet unblinkingly glowed 
dimmest blue — one each for

Starveling, following Pros- 
pero in line astern on slave

piloting. Once the buttons had 
been green, but they’d wiped 
that color off the boards be- 
cause of the Enemy. 

The gages still showed their 
last maximums. Skin 793 Kel- 
vin, Cabin 144 Fahrenheit, 
Gravs 3.2. All of them hit al- 
most a year ago, when they’d 
been ace-ing past the sun. 
Grunfield’s gaze edged back 
to the five bulbous pressure 
suits, once more rigidly up- 
right in their braced racks, 
that they’d been wearing dur- 
ing that stretch of accelera- 
tion inside the orbit of Mer- 
cury. He started. For a mo- 
ment he’d thought he saw the 
dark-circled eyes of the cap- 
tain peering between two of 
the bulging black suits. 
Nerves! The captain had to be 
in his cabin, readying alter- 
nate piloting programs for 
Copperhead. 

Suddenly Grunfeld jerked 
his face back toward the 
spaceshield — so violently that 
his body began very slowly to 
spin in the opposite direction. 
This time he’d thought he saw 
the Enemy’s green flashing 
near the margin of the planet 
— bright green, viridian, far 
vivider than that of Uranus 
herself. He drew himself to 
the telescope and feverishly 
studied the area. Nothing at 
all. N erves again. If the Ene- 
my were much nearer than a 
light-minute, Jackson would 
esp it and give warning. The 
next star was still three min- 
utes from rim contact. Grun- 
felds mind retreated to the 

1 1 




circumstances that had 
brought Prospero (then only 
Mercury One) out here. 

II 

W HEN the First Interstel- 
lar War erupted, the pio- 
neer fleets of Earth's nations 
had barely pushed their ex- 
plorations beyond the orbit of 
Saturn. Except for the vessels 
of the International Meteor 
Guard, spaceflight was still a 
military enterprise of Ameri- 
ca, Russia, England and the 
other mega-powers. 

During the first months the 
advantage lay wholly with the 
slim black cruisers of the Ene- 
my, who had an antigravity 
which allowed them to hover 
near planets without going 
into orbit; and a frightening 
degree of control over light 
itself. Indeed, their principal 
weapon was a tight beam of 
visible light, a dense photonic 
stiletto with an effective 
range of several Jupiter-di- 
ameters in vacuum. They also 
used visible light, in the green 
band, for communication as 
men use radio, sometimes 
broadcasting it and sometimes 
beaming it loosely in strange 
abstract pictures that seemed 
part of their language. Their 
gravity-immune ships moved 
by reaction to photonic jets 
the tightness of which ren- 
dered them invisible except 
near the sun, where they tend- 
ed to ionize electronically dir- 
ty volumes of space. It was 
probably this effective invisi- 

12 



bility, based on light-control, 
which allowed them to pene- 
trate the Solar System as deep 
as Earth's orbit undetected, 
rather than any power of trav- 
el in time or sub-space, as was 
first assumed. Earthmen could 
only guess at the physical ap- 
pearance of the Enemy, since 
no prisoners were taken on 
either side. 

Despite his impressive ma- 
neuverability and armament, 
the Enemy was oddly timid 
about attacking live planets. 
He showed no fear of the big 
gas planets, in fact hovering 
very close to their turgid sur- 
faces, as if having some way 
of fueling from them. 

Near Terra the first tactic 
of the black cruisers, after de- 
stroying Lunostrovok and 
Circumluna, was to hover be- 
hind the moon, as though shar- 
ing its tide-lockedness — a cir- 
cumstance that led to a sortie 
by Earth’s Combined Fleet, 
England and Sweden ex- 
cepted. 

At the wholly disastrous 
Battle of the Far Side, which 
was visible in part to naked- 
eye viewers on Earth, the 
Combined Fleet was annihil- 
ated. No Enemy ship was cap- 
tured, boarded, or seriously 
damage d — except for one 
which, apparently by a fluke, 
was struck by a fission-headed 
anti-missile and proceded af- 
ter the blast to “burn," mean- 
ing that it suffered a slow and 
puzzling disintegration, ac- 
companied by a dazzling rain- 
bow display of visible radia-

tion. This was before the “stu- 
pidity” of the Enemy with re- 
guard to small atomic missiles 
was noted, or their allergy to 
certain radio wave bands, and 
also before Terran telepaths 
began to claim cloudy contact 
with Enemy minds. 

Following Far Side, the 
Enemy burst into activity, 
harrying Terran spacecraft as 
far as Mercury and Saturn, 
though still showing great 
caution in maneuver and mak- 
ing no direct attacks on plan- 
ets. It was as if a race of heav- 
ily armed marine creatures 
should sink all ocean-going 
ships or drive them to harbor, 
but make no assaults beyond 
the shore line. For a full year 
Earth, though her groundside 
and satellite rocketyards were 
furiously busj', had no vehicle 
in deep space — with one ex- 
ception. 

A T the onset of the War a 
fleet of five mobile bases 
of the U. S. Space Force were 
in Orbit to Mercury, where it 
was intended they take up sat- 
ellite positions prior to the 
prospecting and mineral ex- 
ploitation of the small sun- 
blasted planet. These five 
ships, each with a skeleton 
five-man crew, were essential- 
ly Ross-Smith space stations 
with a solar drive, assembled 
in space and intended solely 
for space-to-space flight in- 
side Earth’s orbit. A huge par- 
aboloid mirror, its diameter 
four times the length of the 
ship’s hull, superheated at its 
THE SNOWBANK ORBIT 



focus the hydrogen which was 
ejected as a plasma at high 
exhaust velocity. Each ship 
likewise mounted versatile ra- 
dio-radar equipment on dual 
lattice arms and carried as 
ship’s launch a two-man chem- 
ical fuel rocket adaptable as 
a fusion-headed torpedo. 

After Far Side, this “tin 
can” fleet was ordered to by- 
pass Mercury and, tacking on 
the sun, shape an orbit for 
Uranus, chiefly because that 
remote planet, making its 84- 
year circuit of Sol, was cur- 
rently on the opposite side 
of the sun to the four inner 
planets and the two nearer gas 
giants Jupiter and Saturn. In 
the empty regions of space the 
relatively defenseless fleet 
might escape the attention of 
the Enemy. 

However, while still accel- 
erating into the sun for maxi- 
mum boost, the fleet received 
information that two Enemy 
cruisers were in pursuit. The 
five ships cracked on all pos- 
sible speed, drawing on the 
solar drive’s high efficiency 
near the sun and expending 
all their hydrogen and most 
material capable of being vap- 
orized, including some of the 
light-metal hydrogen storage 
tanks — like an old steamer 
burning her cabin furniture 
and the cabins themselves to 
win a race. Gradually the 
curving course that w r ould 
have taken years to reach the 
outer planet flattened into a 
hyperbola that would make the 
journey in 200 days. 



13 




In the asteroid belt the pur- 
suing cruisers turned aside to 
join in the crucial Battle of 
the Trojans with Earth's 
largely new-built, more heav- 
ily and wisely armed Com- 
bined Fleet — a battle that 
proved to be only a prelude 
to the decisive Battle of Jupi- 
ter. 

Meanwhile the five-ship 
fleet sped onward, its solar 
drive quite useless in this twi- 
light region even if it could 
have scraped together the 
needed boilable ejectant mass 
to slow its flight. Weeks be- 
came months. The ships were 
renamed for the planet they 
were aimed at. At least the 
fleet’s trajectory had been 
truly set. 

Almost on collision course 
it neared Uranus, a mystery- 
cored ball of frigid gas 
32,000 miles wide coasting 
through space across the 
fleet’s course at a lazy four 
miles a second. At this time 
the fleet was traveling at 100 
miles a second. Beyond Ura- 
nus lay only the interstellar 
night, into which the fleet 
would inevitably vanish... 

U NLESS, Grunfeld told 
himself .. .unless the fleet 
shed its velocity by ramming 
the gaseous bulk of Uranus. 
This idea of atmospheric brak- 
ing on a grand scale had 
sounded possible at first sug- 
gestion, half a year ago— a lit- 
tle like a man falling off a 
mountain or from a plane and 
saving his life by dropping 

14 



into a great thickness of feath- 
ery new-fallen snow. 

Supposing her solar jet 
worked out here and she had 
the reaction mass, Prospero 
could have shed her present 
velocity in five hours, decel- 
erating at a comfortable one 
G. 

But allowing her 12,000 
miles of straight-line travel 
through Uranus’ frigid soupy 
atmosphere — and that might 
be dipping very close to the 
methane seas blanketing the 
planet’s hypothetical mineral 
core — Prospero would have 
two minutes in which to shed 
her velocity. 

Two minutes — at 150 Gs. 

Men had stood 40 and 50 
Gs for a fractional second. 

But for two minutes... 
Grunfeld told himself that the 
only surer way to die would 
be to run into a section of the 
Enemy fleet. According to 
one calculation the ship’s skin 
would melt by heat of friction 
in 90 seconds, despite the low 
temperature of the abrading 
atmosphere. 

The star Grunfeld had been 
waiting for touched the hazy 
rim of Uranus. He drifted 
back to the eyepiece and began 
to follow it in as the pale 
planet’s hydrogen muted its 
diamond brilliance. 

Ill 

I N the aft cabin, lank hairy- 
wristed Croker pinned an- 
other blanket around black 
Jackson as the latter shivered 

by Fritz Leiber 




in his trance. Then Croker 
turned on a small light at the 
head of the hammock. 

“Captain won’t like that,” 
plump pale Ness observed 
tranquilly from where he 
floated in womb position 
across the cabin. “Enemy can 
feel a candle of our light, cap- 
tain says, ten million miles 
away.” He rocked his elbows 
for warmth and his body wob- 
bled in reaction like a polly- 
wog’s. 

“And Jackson hears the 
Enemy think. .and Heimdall 
hears the grass grow,” Croker 
commented with a harsh man- 
ic laugh. “Isn’t an Enemy for 
a billion miles, Ness.” He 
launched aft from the ham- 
mock. “We haven’t spotted 
their green since Saturn or- 
bit. There’s nowhere for 
them.” 

“There’s the far side of 
Uranus,” Ness pointed out. 
“That’s less than ten million 
miles now. Eight. A bare day. 
They could be there.” 

“Yes, waiting to bushwack 
us as we whip past on our way 
to eternity,” Croker chuckled 
as he crumpled up against the 
aft port, shedding momentum. 
“That’s likely, isn’t it, when 
they didn’t have time for us 
back in the Belt?” He scowled 
at the tiny white sun, no big- 
ger a disk than Venus, but 
still with one hundred times 
as much light as the full moon 
pouring from it — too much 
light to look at comfortably. 
He began to button the inner 
cover over the port. 

THE SNOWBANK ORBIT 



“Don’t do that,” Ness ob- 
jected without conviction. 
“There’s not much heat in it 
but there’s some.” He hugged 
his elbows and shivered. “I 
don’t remember being warm 
since Mars orbit.” 

“The sun gets on my 
nerves,” Croker said. “It’s like 
looking at an arc light through 
a pinhole. It’s like a high, 
high jail light in a cold con- 
crete yard. The stars are 
highlights on the barbed 
wire.” He continued to button 
out the sun. 

“You ever in jail?” Ness 
asked. Croker grinned. 

W ITH the tropism of a 
fish, Ness began to pad- 
dle toward the little light at 
the head of Jackson’s ham- 
mock, flicking his hands from 
the wrists like flippers. “I got 
one thing against the sun,” he 
said quietly. “It’s blanketing 
out the radio. I’d like us to 
get one more message from 
Earth. We haven’t tried rig- 
ging our mirror to catch radio 
waves. I’d like to hear how we 
won the battle of Jupiter.” 
“If we won it,” Croker said. 
“Our telescopes show no 
more green around Jove,” 
Ness reminded him. “We 
counted 27 rainbows of Ene- 
my cruisers ‘burning.’ Captain 
verified the count.” 

“Repeat : if we won it.” 

Croker pushed off and drifted 
back toward the hammock. “If 
there was a real victory mes- 
sage they’d push it through, 
even if the sun’s in the way 

15 




and it takes three hours to 
catch us. People who win, 
shout.” 

Ness shrugged as he pad- 
died. “One way or the other, 
we should be getting the news 
soon from Titania station,” he 
said. “They’ll have heard.” 

“If they’re still alive and 
there ever was a Titania Sta- 
tion,” Croker amended, back- 
ing air violently to stop him- 
self as he neared the ham- 
mock. “Look, Ness, we know 
that the First Uranus Expe- 
dition arrived. At least they 
set off their flares. But that 
was three years before the 
War and we haven’t any idea 
of what’s happened to them 
since and if they ever man- 
aged to set up housekeeping 
on Titania — or Ariel or Ober- 
on or even Miranda or Um- 
briel. At least if they built 
a station could raise Earth I 
haven’t been told. Sure thing 
Prospero hasn’t heard any- 
thing.-.and we’re getting 
close.” 

“I won’t argue,” Ness said. 
“Even if we raise ’em, it’ll 
just be hello-goodby with 
maybe time between for a bat- 
tle report.” 

“And a football score and a 
short letter from home, ten 
seconds per man as the sta- 
tion fades.” Croker frowned 
and added, “If Captain had 
cottoned to my idea, two of us 
at any rate could have got off 
this express train at Uranus.” 

“Tell me how,” Ness asked 
drily. 

“How? Why, one of the 

16 



ship’s launches. Replace the 
fusion-head with the cabin. 
Put all the chem fuel in the 
tanks instead of divvying it 
between the ship and the 
launch.” 

“I haven’t got the brain for 
math Copperhead has, but I 
can subtract,” Ness said, re- 
ferring to Prospero’s piloting 
robot. “Fully fueled, one of 
the launches has a max veloc- 
ity change in free-fall of 30 
miles per second. Use it all 
in braking and you’ve only 
taken 30 from 100. The launch 
is still going past Uranus and 
out of the system at 70 miles 
a second.” 

“You didn’t hear all my 
idea,” Croker said. “You put 
piggyback tanks on your 
launch and top them off with 
the fuel from the other four 
launches. Then you’ve 100 
miles of braking and a maneu- 
vering reserve. You only need 
to shed 90 miles, anyway. Ten 
miles a second’s the close cir- 
cum-Uranian velocity. Go into 
circum-Uranian orbit and wait 
for Titania to send their jeep 
to pick you up. Have to start 
the maneuver four hours this 
side of Uranus, though. Take 
that long at 1 G to shed it.” 

“Cute,” Ness conceded. “Es- 
pecially the jeep. But I’m 
glad just the same we've got 
70 per cent of our chem fuel 
in our ships’ tanks instead of 
the launches. We’re on such a 
bull’s eye course for Uranus 
— Copperhead really pulled a 
miracle plotting our orbit — 
that we may need a sidewise 
by Fritz Leiber 




shove to miss her. If we 
slapped into that cold hydro- 
gen soup at our 100 mps — ” 
Croker shrugged. “We still 
could have dropped a couple 
of us,” he said. 

Uf^APTAIN’S got to look 
^ after the whole fleet,” 
Ness said. “You’re beginning 
to agitate, Croker, like you 
was Grunfeld — or the captain 
himself.” 

“But if Titania Station’s 
alive, a couple of men dropped 
off would do the fleet some 
good. Stir Titania up to punch 
a message through to Earth 
and get a really high-speed re- 
trieve-and-rescue ship started 
out after us. If we’ve won the 
War.” 

“But Titania Station’s dead 
or never was, not to mention 
its jeep. And we’ve lost the 
Eattle of Jupiter. You said so 
yourself,” Ness asserted owl- 
ishly. “Captain’s got to look 
after the whole fleet.” 

“Yeah, so he kills himself 
fretting and the rest of us die 
of old age in the outskirts of 
the Solar System. Join the 
Space Force and See the 
Stars! Ness, do you know how 
long it’d take us to reach the 
nearest star — except we aren’t 
headed for her — at our 100 
mps? Eight thousand years!” 
“That’s a lot of time to 
kill,” Ness said. “Let’s play 
chess.” 

Jackson sighed and they 
both looked quickly at the 
dark unlined face above the 
cocoon, but the lips did not 

THE SNOWBANK ORBIT 



flutter again, or the eyelids. 
Croker said, ''Suppose’ he 
knows what the Enemy looks 
like?” 

“I suppose,” Ness said. 
“When he talks about them 
it’s as if he was their inter- 
preter. How about the chess?” 
“Suits. Knight to King 
Bishop Three.” 

“Hmm. Knight to King 
Knight Two, Third Floor.” 
“Hey, I meant flat chess, 
not three-D,” Croker objected. 

“That thin old game? Why, 
I no sooner start to get the 
position really visualized in 
my head than the game’s 
over.” 

“I don’t want to start a 
game of three-D with Uranus 
only 18 hours away.” 

Jackson stirred in his ham- 
mock. His lips worked. 
“They. .” he breathed. Crok- 
er and Ness instantly watched 
him. “They...” 

“I wonder if he is really in- 
side the Enemy’s mind?” Ness 
said. 

“He thinks he speaks for 
them,” Croker replied and the 
next instant felt a warning 
touch on his arm and looked 
sideways and saw dark-circled 
eyes in a skull-angular face 
under a battered cap with a 
tarnished sunburst. D a m a 
thought Croker, how does the 
captain always know when 
Jackson’s going to talk? 

“They are waiting for us on 
the other side of Uranus,” 
Jackson breathed. His lips 
trembled into a smile and his 
voice grew a little louder, 

17 




though his eyes stayed shut. 
“They’re welcoming us, 
they’re our brothers.” The 
smile died. “But they know 
they got to kill us, they know 
we got to die.” 

The hammock with its 
tight-swathed form began to 
move past Croker and he 
snatched at it. The captain had 
pushed off from him for the 
hatch leading forward. 

G RUNFELD was losing the 
new star at 2200 miles into 
Uranus when he saw the two 
viridian flares flashing be- 
tween it and the rim. Each 
flash was circled by a fleet- 
ing bright green ring, like a 
mist halo. He thought he’d be 
afraid when he saw that green 
again, but what he felt was a 
jolt of excitement that made 
him grin. With it came a 
touch on his shoulder. He 
thought, the captain always 
knows. 

“Ambush,” he said. “At least 
two cruisers.” 

He yielded the eyepiece to 
the captain. Even without the 
telescope he could see those 
incredibly brilliant green 
flickers. He asked himself if 
the Enemy was already gun- 
ning for the fleet through 
Uranus. 

The blue telltales for Cali- 
ban and Starveling began to 
blink. 

“They’ve seen it too,” the 
captain said. He snatched up 
the mike and his next words 
rang through the Prospero . 

“Rig ship for the snowbank 
THE SNOWBANK ORBIT 



orbit ! Snowbank orbit with 
stinger! Mr. Grunfeld, raise 
the fleet.” 

Aft, Croker muttered, “Rig 
our shrouds, don’t he mean? 
Rig shrouds and firecrackers 
mounted on Fourth of July 
rockets.” 

Ness said, “Cheer up. Even 
the longest strategic with- 
drawal in history has to end 
some time.” 

IV 

T HREE quarters of a day 
later Grunfeld felt a 
spasm of futile fear and re- 
volt as the pressure suit 
closed like a thick-fleshed 
carnivorous plant on his 
drugged and tired body. Re- 
lax, he told himself. Fine 
thing if you cooked up a fuss 
when even Croker didn’t. He 
thought of forty things to re- 
check. Relax, he repeated — the 
work’s over; all that matters 
is in Copperhead’s memory 
tanks now, or will be as soon 
as the captain’s suited up. 

The suit held Grunfeld 
erect, his arms at his sides — 
the best attitude, except he 
was still facing forward, for 
taking high G, providing the 
ship herself didn’t start to 
tumble. Only the cheekpieces 
and visor hadn’t closed in on 
his face — translucent hand- 
thick petals as yet unfolded. 
He felt the delicate firm pres- 
sure of built-in fingertips 
monitoring his pulses and 
against his buttocks the cold 
smooth muzzles of the jet hy- 

19 




podermics that would feed 
him metronomic drugs during 
the high-G stretch and stimu- 
lants when they were in free- 
fall again. When. 

He could swing his head and 
eyes just enough to make out 
the suits of Croker and Ness 
to either side of him and their 
profiles wavy through the 
jutting misty cheekpieces. 
Ahead to the left was Jackson 
— just the back of his suit, 
like a black snowman stand- 
ing at attention, pale-olive- 
edged by the great glow of 
Uranus. And to the right the 
captain, his legs suited but his 
upper body still bent out to 
the side as he checked the 
monitor of his suit with its 
glowing blue button and the 
manual controls that would lie 
under his hands during the 
maneuver. 

Beyond the captain was the 
spaceshield, the lower quarter 
of it still blackness and stars, 
but the upper three-quarters 
filled with the onrushing 
planet's pale mottled green 
that now had the dulled rich- 
ness of watered silk. They 
were so close that the rim 
hardly showed curvature. The 
atmosphere must have a steep 
gradient, Grunfeld thought, or 
they'd already be feeling de- 
cel. That stuff ahead looked 
more like water than any kind 
of air. It bothered him that 
the captain was still half out 
of his suit. 

There should be action and 
shouted commands, Grunfeld 
thought, to fill up these last 

20 



tight-stretched minutes. Last 
orders to the fleet, port cov- 
ers being cranked shut, some- 
one doing a countdown on the 
firing of their torpedo. But 
the last message had gone to 
the fleet minutes ago. Its 
robot pilots were set to follow 
Prospero and imitate, nothing 
else. And all the rest was up 
to Copperhead. Still... 

Grunfeld wet his lips. “Cap- 
tain," he said hesitantly. “Cap- 
tain?" 

“Thank you, Granfeld." He 
caught the edge of the skull’s 
answering grin. “We are be- 
ginning to hit hydrogen," the 
quiet voice went on. “Forward 
skin temperature's up to 9 K." 

Beyond the friendly skull, 
a great patch of the rim of 
Uranus flared bright green. 
As if that final stimulus had 
been needed, Jackson began to 
talk dreamily from his suit. 

“They’re still welcoming us 
and grieving for us. I begin 
to get it a little more now. 
Their ship’s one thing and 
they're another. Their ship is 
frightened to death of us. It 
hates us and the only thing it 
knows to do is to kill us. They 
can't stop it, they’re even less 
than passengers. ." 

The captain was in his suit 
now. Grunfeld sensed a faint 
throbbing and felt a rush of 
cold air. The cabin refrigera- 
tion system had started up, 
carrying cabin heat to the lat- 
tice arms. Intended to protect 
them from solar heat, it would 
now do what it could against 
the heat of friction. 



by Fritz Leiber 




The straight edge of Uranus 
was getting hazier. Even the 
fainter stars shone through, 
spangling it. A bell jangled 
and the pale green segment 
narrowed as the steel meteor 
panels began to close in front 
of the spaceshield. Soon there 
was only a narrow vertical 
ribbon of green — bright green 
as it narrowed to a thread — 
then for a few seconds only 
blackness except for the dim 
red and blue beads and semi- 
circles, just beyond the cap- 
tain, of the board. Then the 
muted interior cabin lights 
glowed on. 

J ACKSON droned: “They 

and their ships come from 
very far away, from the edge. 
If this is the continuum, they 
come from the. .discontinu- 
um, where they don’t have 
stars but something else and 
where gravity is different. 
Their ships came from the 
edge on a gust of fear with 
the other ships, and our broth- 
ers came with it though they 
didn’t want to. .” 

And now Grunfeld thought 
he began to feel it — the first 
faint thrill, less than a cob- 
web’s tug, of weight. 

The cabin wall moved side- 
ways. Grunfeld’s suit had be- 
gun to revolve slowly on a 
vertical axis. 

For a moment he glimpsed 
Jackson’s dark profile — all 
five suits were revolving in 
their framework. They locked 
into position when the men in 
them were facing aft. Now at 
THE SNOWBANK ORBIT 



least retinas wouldn’t pull for- 
ward at high-G decel, oT 
spines crush through thorax 
and abdomen. 

The cabin air was cold on 
Grunfeld’s forehead. And now 
he was sure he felt weight — 
maybe five pounds of it. Sud- 
denly aft was up. It was as if 
he were lying on his back on 
the spaceshield. 

A sudden snarling roar came 
through his suit from the 
beams bracing it. He lost 
weight, then regained it and 
a little more besides. He real- 
ized it was their torpedo tak- 
ing off, to skim by Uranus 
in the top of the atmosphere 
and then curve inward the lit- 
tle their chem fuel would let 
them, homing toward the En- 
emy. He imaged its tiny red 
jet over the great gray-green 
glowing plain. Four more 
would be taking off from the 
other ships — the fleet’s feeble 
sting. Like a bee’s, just one, 
in dying. 

The cheekpieces and fore- 
headpiece of Grunfeld’s suit 
began to close on his face like 
layers of pliable ice. 

Jackson called faintly, 
“Now I understand. Their 
ship — ” His voice was cut off. 

Grunfeld’s ice-mask was 
tight shut. He felt a small 
surge of vigor as the suit took 
over his breathing and sent 
his lungs a gush of high-oxy 
air. Then came a tingling 
numbness as the suit field 
went on, adding an extra prop 
against decel to each molecule 
of his body. 



21 




But the weight was grow- 
ing. He was on the moon now 
. now on Mars . now back 
on Earth ... 

The weight was stifling 
now, crushing — a hill of in- 
visible sand. Grunfeld saw a 
black pillow hanging in the 
cabin above him aft. It had 
red fringe around it. It grew. 

There was a whistling and 
shaking. Everything lurched 
torturingly, the ship’s jets 
roared, everything recovered, 
or didn’t. 

The black pillow came down 
on him, crushing out sight, 
crushing out thought. 

T HE universe was a black 
tingling, a limitless ache 
floating in a larger black in- 
finity. Something drew back 
and there was a dry fiery wind 
on numb humps and ridges — 
the cabin air on his face, 
Grunfeld decided, then shiv- 
ered and started at the 
thought that he was alive and 
in freefall. His body didn’t 
feel like a mass of internal 
hemorrhages. Or did it? 

He spun slowly. It stopped. 
Dizziness? Or the suits 
revolving forward again? 
If they’d actually come 
through — 

There was a creaking and 
cracking. The ship contract- 
ing after frictional heating? 

There was a faint stink like 
ammonia and formaldehyde 
mixed. A few Uranian mole- 
cules forced past plates racked 
by turbulence? 

He saw dim red specks. The 
22 



board? Or last flickers from 
ruined retinas? A bell jangled. 
He waited, but he saw noth- 
ing. Blind? Or the meteor 
guard jammed? No wonder if 
it were. No wonder if the cab- 
in lights were broken. 

The hot air that had dried 
his sweaty face rushed down 
the front of his body. Needles 
of pain pierced him as he 
slumped forward out of the 
top of his opening suit. 

Then he saw the horizontal 
band of stars outlining the top 
of the spaceshield and below 
it the great field of inky 
black, barely convex upward, 
that must , he realized, be the 
dark side of Uranus . 

Pain ignored, Grunfeld 
pushed himself forward out of 
his suit and pulled himself 
past the captain’s to the space- 
shield. 

The view stayed the same, 
though broadening out: stars 
above, a curve-edged velvet 
black plain below. They were 
orbiting. 

A pulsing, color-changing 
glow from somewhere showed 
him twisted stumps of the ra- 
dio lattices. There was no sign 
of the mirror at all. It must 
have been torn away, or va- 
porized completely, in the 
fiery turbulence of decel. 

New maxs showed on the 
board : Cabin Temperature 

214 F, Skin Temperature 907 
K, Gravs 87. 

Then in the top of the 
spacefield, almost out of vi- 
sion, Grunfeld saw the source 
of the pulsing glow: two

sharp-ended ovals flickering 
brightly all colors against the 
pale starfields, like two dead 
fish phosphorescing. 

“The torps got to ’em,” 
Croker said, pushed forward 
beside Grunfeld to the right. 

66T did find out at the end/' 

-A Jackson said quietly from 
the left, his voice at last free 
of the trance-tone. “The En- 
emy ships weren’t ships at all. 
They were (there’s no other 
word for it) space animals. 
We’ve always thought life was 
a prerogative of planets, that 
space was inorganic. But you 
can walk miles through the 
desert or sail leagues through 
the sea before you notice life 
and I guess space is the same. 
Anyway the Enemy was (what 
else can I call ’em?) space- 
whales. Inertialess space- 
whales from the discontinu- 
um. Space-whales that ate hy- 
drogen (that’s the only way I 
know to say it) and spat light 
to move and fight. The ones 
I talked to, our brothers, were 
just their parasites.” 

“That’s crazy,” Grunfeld 
said. “All of it. A child’s pic- 
ture.” 

“Sure it is,” Jackson agreed. 

From beyond Jackson, Ness, 
punching buttons, said, 
“Quiet.” 

The radio came on thin and 
wailing with static: “Titania 
Station calling fleet. We have 
jeep and can orbit in to you. 
The two Enemy are dead — the 
last in the System. Titania 
Station calling fleet. We have 

THE SNOWBANK ORBIT 



jeep fueled and set to go— 99 

Fleet? thought Grunfeld. 
He turned back to the board. 
The first and last blue tell- 
tales still glowed for Caliban 
and Starveling. Breathe a 
prayer, he thought, for Moth 
and Snug. 

Something else shone on the 
board, something Grunfeld 
knew had to be wrong. Three 
little words: SHIP ON MAN- 
UAL. 

The black rim of Uranus 
ahead suddenly brightened 
along its length, which was 
very slightly bowed, like a 
section of a giant new moon. 
A bead formed toward the 
center, brightened, and then 
all at once the jail-yard sun 
had risen and was glaring 
coldly through its pinhole into 
their eyes. 

They looked away from it. 
Grunfeld turned around. 

The austere light showed 
the captain still in his pres- 
sure suit, only the head fallen 
out forward, hiding the skull 
features. Studying the monitor 
box of the captain’s suit, 
Grunfeld saw it was set to in- 
ject the captain with power* 
stimulants as soon as the 
Gravs began to slacken from 
their max. 

He realized who had done 
the impossible job of piloting 
them out of Uranus. 

But the button on the moni- 
tor, that should have glowed 
blue, was as dark as those of 
Moth and Snug. 

Grunfeld thought, now he 
can rest. END

when he finished, but he 
walked past her as if she

“Why, Chester! What’s the

trailing him into the bedroom. 
“I’ve never heard you talk

“None of your business,” he 
mumbled, setting a firm upper 
lip and gazing at her with liz-

He picked up his tie, laughed 
at it with careless ease and 
threw it across the room. “See

said. 

“If you'll excuse me, I think

“But, Oswald, it's three

ning a tee-shirt and tweed 
trousers. With snake-swift 
Marlon Brando hands, he 
tossed his plaid scarf in her 
face. 

“Excuse me, Louise," he 
whispered, “but I gotta make 
it. ." 

Then, laughing softly, he 
strode from the room. 

A T three o’clock in the 
morning, even a large city 
is quiet and dark and almost 
dead. At times, the city 
twitches in its sleep ; occa- 
sionally it rolls over or mut- 
ters to itself. But only rarely 
is its slumber shattered by a 
scream. 

“Johnny! Hey, Johnny!" 
cries Chester McRae, his eyes 
as dull and poisonous as two 
tiny toads. 

“Let's make it, man . let's 
split...” whispers Bartholo- 
mew Oliver, one finger brush- 
ing his nose like a rattler nos- 
ing a dead mouse. 

“I don make no move with- 
out my boys," says Oswald 
Williams, his hands curled 
like scorpion tails. 

Together they walk down 
the street, moving with slow 
insolence, their lips curled in 
snarls or slack with indiffer-

ence, their eyes glittering 
with hidden hatreds. But they 
are not alone in the city. The 
college boys are coming, in 
their dirty jeans and beer- 
stained tee-shirts; so too are 
the lawyers, in dusty jackets 
and leather pants ; so come the 
doctors and the businessmen, 
on stolen motorcycles ; the 
bricklayers and gas station 
attendants, the beatniks and 
dope pushers, the bankers 
and lifesaving instructors, the 
butchers, the bakers, the can- 
dlestick makers. .they are all 
coming, flocking into the city 
for reasons not their own, 
wandering in twos and threes 
and twenties, all of them sul- 
len and quiet, all of them 
shuffling beneath darkly-hued 
clouds of ill intent, all of 
them proud and deadly and 
virile, filling the streets by 
the thousands now, turning 
the streets into rivers of 
flesh. 

“Hey, Johnny/’ says Ches- 
ter, “let’s cool this dump.” 

“Man, let’s make it with the 
skirts,” says Bartholomew. 

“I don see no skirts,” says 
Chester. 

“You pig,” snarls Ozzie. 

The mob is monstrous now. 
like a pride of lion cubs, be- 
yond count in their number, 
without equal in their leonine 
strength, above the common 
quick in their immortal pride, 
milling through the hot black 
veldt, swarming in the city 
streets. Millions of them, more 
than the eye can see or the 
mind can bear. It seems that 

26 



no man sleeps, that every male 
in the great city must walk 
tonight. 

“Johnny,” says Chester, “I 
don dig no chicks on the turf.” 
“Eeee, colay. What a drag,” 
whispers Bartholomew. 

“You goddam logical posi- 
tivist,” snarls Ozzie. 

A N uneasy sound ripples 
through the mob, like the 
angry hiss of an injured ego, 
moving from street to street 
and swelling upward in a sud- 
den, angry roar... they want 
their women, the dance-hall 
girls, the young waitresses, 
the nowhere chicks in five 
dollar dresses, the Spanish 
girls with eyes as dark as the 
Spanish night. And then, as 
though by accident, one man 
looks up at the starry sky and 
sees her — sees her standing on 
a balcony far above them, 
twenty stories above them, up 
where the wind can blow her 
hair and billow her blue dress 
like an orchid of the night. 

She laughs gently, without 
fear, gazing down at the mind- 
less mob of rebels. 

They laugh too, just as 
gently, their quiet eyes crawl- 
ing over the sight of her body, 
far above. 

“Thass my chick,” whispers 
Chester. 

“Cool it, daddy,” says Bar- 
tholomew, slipping into a pair 
of dark glasses and touching 
his lips with the tip of his 
tongue. “That skirt is private 
property.” 

“You boys may walk and 
by Vance Aandahl 




talk/’ says Ozzie, "but you don 
play. You don play with Rio's 
girl-” 

Suddenly, angry words and 
clenched fists erupt from the 
proud, quiet millions that 
flood the streets. Suddenly, a 
roar like the roar of lions 
rises up and buffets the girl 
in blue, the girl on the bal- 
cony. She laughs again, for 
she knows that they are fight- 
ing for her, 

A figure appears on the bal- 
cony, next to the girl. The 
figure is a man, and he too is 
dressed in blue. Suddenly, just 
as suddenly as it began, the 
fighting ceases. 

“My God,” whispers Ches- 
ter, his cheeks gone pale, 
“what am I doing out here?” 

“Maybe I got the D.T.s,” 
whispers Bartholomew, “but 
maybe I don’t...” He sits 
down on the curb and rubs his 
head in disbelief. 

Oswald does not speak. His 
shame is the greatest. He 
slinks into the darkness of an 
alley and briefly wishes for 
an overcoat. 

The pride of lion cubs has 
been routed, and now they 
scatter, each one scrambling 
for his private den of security, 
each one lost in a wild and 
nameless fear. In twc and 
threes and twenties the) rush 
back to their homes, their 
wives, their endless lives. 

Far above, in the apartment 
with the balcony, a man in 
blue is chiding a girl in blue. 

“That was scarcely reason- 
able, Dorothy.” 

1,492,633 MARLON BRANDOS 



“But Daddy, you prom- 
ised to let me have them for 
the entire night!” 

“Yes, but...” 

“I wasn’t really going to let 
them hurt themselves! Really, 
I wasn’t!” 

“But, Dorothy — you know 
these things can get out of 
hand.” 

“Oh, but Daddy, you know 
how I adore strong, quiet, 
proud men. Rebellious men 
like Marlon.” 

“Yes, and you know how I 
adore order and peace. There 
shall be no more riots! And 
tomorrow our little puppets 
shall go back to their ‘dull’ 
lives, as you so wittily put 
it, and everything shall be as 
I wish.” 

T HREE hours later, Chester 
McRae arose at the sound 
of the alarm, dressed in a stu- 
por and stumbled into his 
kitchen for breakfast. 

“My goodness, Chester,” 
said his wife, who had already 
arisen, “you look grouchier 
than usual! Ha, ha!” 

He smiled wanly and opened 
the morning paper. 

Halfway across town, Bar- 
tholomew Oliver was still 
asleep, casually lost in the 
pleasures of an erotic dream. 
But Professor Oswald Wil- 
liams, his tiny jaw unshaven 
and his eager eyes shot 
through with fatigue, had 
been hard at work for three 
hours, scribbling down his 
latest exposure of the logical 
positivists.

THE 

WINNING 

BY KRIS NEVILLE Illustrated by Burns 



G ENERAL Finogenov no- 
tified Major Winship 
that the underground blast 
was scheduled for the follow- 
ing morning. 

Major Winship, after re- 
ceiving the message, dis- 
cussed precautions with the 
three other Americans. 

Next morning, before the 
sunlight exploded, the four 

26 



of them donned their space 
suits and went and sat out- 
side the dome, waiting. The 
sun rose with its bright, si- 
lent clap of radiance. Black 
pools of shadows lay in harsh 
contrast, their edges drawn 
with geometric precision. 

Major Winship attempted 
unsuccessfully to communi- 
cate with Base Gagarin. 



OF THE MOON 



“Will you please request the 
general to keep us informed 
on the progress of the count- 
down ?” 

“Is Pinov,” came the reply. 
“Help?” 

“Nyet” said Major Win- 
ship, exhausting his Russian. 
“Count down. Progress. 
When — boom?” 

“Is Pinov,” came the reply. 



“Boom! Boom!” said Major 
Winship in exasperation. 

“Boom!” said Pinov hap- 
pily. 

“When?” 

“Boom-boom!” said Pinov. 

“Oh, nuts.” Major Winship 
cut out the circuit. “They’ve 
got Pinov on emergency 
watch this morning,” he ex- 
plained to the other Ameri-

cans. “The one that doesn’t 
speak English/' 

“He's done it deliberately,'* 
said Capt. Wilkins, the eldest 
of the four Americans. “How 
are we going to know when 
it's over?" 

No one bothered to re- 
spond. They sat for a while 
in silence while the shadows 
evaporated. One by one they 
clicked on their cooling sys- 
tems. 

Ultimately, Lt. Chandler 
said, “This is a little ridicu- 
lous. I'm going to switch over 
to their channel. Rap if you 
want me." He sat transfixed 
for several minutes. “Ah, it's 
all Russian. Jabbering away. 
I can’t tell a thing that’s go- 
ing on." 

In the airless void of the 
moon, the blast itself would 
be silent. A moth’s wing of 
dust would, perhaps, rise and 
settle beyond the horizon: no 
more. 

“Static?" 

“Nope." 

“We'll get static on these 
things." 

A small infinity seemed to 
pass very slowly. 

Major Winship shifted 
restlessly. “My reefer’s gone 
on the fritz." Perspiration 
was trickling down his face. 

“Let’s all go in,” said the 
fourth American, Capt. Law- 
ler. “It’s probably over by 
now." 

“I'll try again," Major 
Winship said and switched to 
the emergency channel. “Base 
Gagarin? Base Gagarin?" 

30 



“Is Pinov. Help?" 

“Nyet." 

“Pinov's still there," Major 
Winship said. 

“Tell him, 'Help'," said 
Capt. Wilkins, “so he’ll get 
somebody we can talk to." 

“I’ll see them all in hell, 
first," Major Winship said. 

Five minutes later, the per- 
spiration was rivers across 
his face. “This is it," he said. 
“I’m going in." 

“Let’s all—" 

“No. I’ve got to cool off." 

“Hell, Charlie, I feel stu- 
pid sitting out here," Capt. 
Lawler said. “The shot proba- 
bly went off an hour ago." 

“The static level hasn’t 
gone up much, if at all." 

“Maybe," Lt. Chandler said, 
“it’s buried too deep." 

“Maybe so," Major Win- 
ship said. “But we can’t have 
the dome fall down around 
all our ears." He stood. 
“Whew! You guys stay put." 

H E crossed with the float- 
ing moon-motion to the 
airlock and entered, closing 
the door behind him. The 
darkness slowly filled with 
air, and the temperature in- 
side the suit declined steadi- 
ly. At the proper moment of 
pressure, the inner lock slid 
open and Major Winship 
stepped into the illuminated 
central area. His foot was 
lifted for the second step 
when the floor beneath him 
rose and fell gently, pitching 
him forward, off balance. He 
stumbled against the table 

by Kris Nsvills 




and ended up seated beside 
the radio equipment. The 
ground moved again. 

“Charlie ! Charlie !” 

“I’m okay,” Major Winship 
answered. “Okay! Okay!” 

-It’s—” 

There was additional sur- 
face movement. The move- 
ment ceased. 

“Hey, Les, how’s it look?” 
Capt. Wilkins asked. 

“Okay from this side. 
Charlie, you still okay?” 

“Okay,” Major Winship 
said. “We told them this 
might happen,” he added bit- 
terly. 

There was a wait during 
which everyone seemed to be 
holding their breath. 

“I guess it’s over,” said 
Major Winship, getting to 
his feet. “Wait a bit more, 
there may be an aftershock.” 
He switched once again to 
the emergency channel. 

“Is Pinov,” came the su- 
premely relaxed voice. 
“Help?” 

Major Winship whinnied 
in disgust. “ Nyet /” he 
snarled. To the other Ameri- 
cans: “Our comrades seem 

unconcerned.” 

“Tough.” 

They began to get the 
static for the first time. It 
crackled and snapped in their 
speakers. They made sounds 
of disapproval at each other. 
For a minute or two, static 
blanked out the communica- 
tions completely. It then 
abated to something in excess 
of normal. 

THE WINNING OF THE MOON 



“Well,” Lt. Chandler com- 
mented, “even though we 
didn’t build this thing to 
withstand a moonquake, it 
seems to have stood up all 
right.” 

“I guess I was just — ” Ma- 
jor Winship began. “Oh, 
hell! We’re losing pressure. 
Where’s the markers?” 

“By the lug cabinet.” 

“Got ’em,” Major Winship 
said a moment later. 

He peeled back a marker 
and let it fall. Air currents 
whisked it away and plas- 
tered it against a riveted 
seam of the dome. It pulsed 
as though it were breathing 
and then it ruptured. 

Major Winship moved 
quickly to cut out the emer- 
gency air supply which had 
cut in automatically with the 
pressure drop. “You guys 
wait. It’s on your right side, 
midway up. I’ll try to sheet 
it.” 

He moved for the plastic 
sheeting. 

“We’ve lost about three 
feet of calk out here,” Capt. 
Lawler said. “I can see more 
ripping loose. You’re losing 
pressure fast at this rate.” 
Major Winship pressed the 
sheeting over the leak. 
“How’s that?” 

“Not yet.” 

“I don’t think I’ve got 
enough pressure left to hold 
it, now. It’s sprung a little, 
and I can’t get it to conform 
over the rivet heads.” 

There was a splatter of 
static. 



31 




"Damn!” Major Winship 
said, “they should have made 
these things more flexible.” 
“Still coming out.” 

“Best I can do.” Major 
Winship stepped back. The 
sheet began slowly to slide 
downward, then it fell away 
completely and lay limply on 
the floor. 

“Come on in,” he said dry- 

iy. 

W ITH the four of them 
inside, it was somewhat 
cramped. Most of the five 
hundred square feet was 
filled with equipment. Elec- 
trical cables trailed loosely 
along the walls and were fes- 
tooned from the ceiling, radi- 
ating from the connections to 
the outside solar cells. The 
living space was more re- 
stricted than in a submarine, 
with the bunks jutting out 
from the walls about six feet 
from the floor. 

Lt. Chandler mounted one 
of the bunks to give them 
more room. “Well,” he said 
wryly, “it doesn’t smell as 
bad now.” 

“Oops,” said Major Win- 
ship. “Just a second. They’re 
coming in.” He switched over 
to the emergency channel. It 
was General Finogenov. 

“Major Winship! Hello! 
Hello, hello, hello. You A 
Okay?” 

“This is Major Winship.” 
“Oh! Excellent, very good. 
Any damage. Major?” 

“Little leak. You?” 

“Came through without 



damage.” General Finogenov 
paused a moment. When no 
comment was forthcoming, he 
continued : “Perhaps we built 
a bit more strongly, Major.” 

“You did this deliberately,” 
Major Winship said testily. 

“No, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. 
Major Winship, please be- 
lieve me. I very much regret 
this. Very much so. I am very 
distressed. Depressed. After 
repeatedly assuring you there 
was no danger of a quake — 
and then to have something 
like this happen. Oh, this is 
very embarrassing to me. Is 
there anything at all we can 
do?” 

“Just leave us alone, thank 
you,” Major Winship said 
and cut off the communica- 
tion. 

“What’d they say?” Capt. 
Wilkins asked. 

“Larry, General Finogenov 
said he was very embarrassed 
by this.” 

“That’s nice,” Lt. Chandler 
said. 

“I’ll be damned surprised,” 
Major Winship said, “if they 
got any seismic data out of 
that shot... Well, to hell 
with them, let’s get this leak 
fixed. Skip, can you get the 
calking compound?’’ 

“Larry, where’s the inven- 
tory?” 

“Les has got it.” 

Lt. Chandler got down 
from the bunk and Capt. Wil- 
kins mounted. 

“Larry,” Major Winship 
said, “why don’t you get 
Earth?” 



32 



by Kris Nevills 




“Okay." 

Capt. Wilkins got down 
from the bunk and Capt. Law- 
ler ascended. 

"Got the inventory sheet, 
Les?” 

"Right here.” 

Squeezed in front of the 
massive transmitter, Capt. 
Wilkins had energized the 
circuits. There was a puzzled 
look on his face. He leaned 
his helmet against the speak- 
er and then shook his head 
sadly. "We can’t hear any- 
thing without any air.” 

Major Winship looked at 
the microphone. "Well, I’ll 
just report and — ” He start- 
ed to pick up the microphone 
and reconsidered. "Yes,” he 
said. "That’s right, isn’t it.” 
Capt. Wilkins flicked off 
the transmitter. "Some days 
you don’t mine at all,” he 
said. 

"Les, have you found it?” 
"It’s around here some- 
where. Supposed to be back 
here.” 

"Well, find it.” 

Lt. Chandler began moving 
boxes. "I saw it— ” 

"Skip, help look.” 

Capt. Lawler got down 
from the bunk and Major 
Winship mounted. "We 
haven’t got all day.” 

A few minutes later, Lt. 
Chandler issued the triumph- 
ant cry. "Here it is! Dozen 
tubes. Squeeze tubes. It’s the 
hew stuff.” 

Major Winship got down 
and Capt. Wilkins got up. 
"Marker showed it over 

THE WINNING OF THE MOON 



here,” Major Winship said, 
inching over to the wall. He 
traced the leak with a metal- 
lic finger. 

"How does this stuff 
work?” Capt. Lawler asked. 

They huddled over the in- 
struction sheet. 

"Let’s see. Squeeze the 
tube until the diaphragm at 
the nozzle ruptures. Extrude 
paste into seam. Allow to 
harden one hour before serv- 

• _ tt 

ice. 

Major Winship said dryly, 
"Never mind. I notice it 
hardens on contact with air.” 

Capt. Wilkins lay back on 
the bunk and stared upward. 
He said, "Now that makes a 
weird kind of sense, doesn’t 
it?” 

"How do they possibly 
think—?” 

"Gentlemen ! It doesn’t 
make any difference,” Lt. 
Chandler said. "Some air 
must already have leaked into 
this one. It’s hard as a rock. 
A gorilla couldn’t extrude 
it.” 

"How’re the other ones?” 
asked Major Winship. 

Lt. Chandler turned and 
made a quick examination. 
"Oh, they’re all hard, too.” 

"Who was supposed to 
check?” demanded Capt. Wil- 
kins in exasperation. 

"The only way you can 
check is to extrude it,” Lt. 
Chandler said, "and if it does 
extrude, you’ve ruined it.” 

"That’s that,” Major Win- 
ship said. "There’s nothing 
for it but to yell help.”

II 

C APT. Lawler and Lt. 

Chandler took the land 
car to Base Gagarin. The So- 
viet base was situated some 
ten miles toward sunset at 
the bottom of a natural fold 
in the surface. The route was 
moderately direct to the tip 
of the gently rolling ridge. 
At that point, the best path- 
way angled left and made an 
S-shaped descent to the basin. 
It was a one-way trip of ap- 
proximately thirty exhausting 
minutes. 

Major Winship, with his 
deficient reefer, remained be- 
hind. Capt. Wilkins stayed 
for company. 

“I want a cigarette in the 
worst way/’ Capt. Wilkins 
said. 

“So do I, Larry. Shouldn’t 
be more than a couple of 
hours. Unless something else 
goes wrong.” 

“As long as they’ll loan us 
the calking compound,” Capt. 
Wilkins said. 

“Yeah, yeah,” Major Win- 
ship said. 

“Let’s eat.” 

“You got any concentrate? 
I’m empty.” 

“I’ll load you,” Capt. Wil- 
kins volunteered wearily. 

It was an awkward opera- 
tion that took several min- 
utes. Capt. Wilkins cursed 
twice during the operation. 
“I’d hate to live in this thing 
for any period.” 

“I think these suits are one 
thing we've got over the 
34 



Russians,” Major Winship 
said. “I don’t see how they 
can manipulate those bulky 
pieces of junk around.” 

They ate. 

“Really horrible stuff.” 
“Nutritious.” 

After the meal, Major Win- 
ship said reflectively, “Now 
I'd like a cup of hot tea. I’m 
cooled off.” 

Capt. Wilkins raised eye- 
brows. “What brought this 
on?” 

“I was just thinking... 
They really got it made, Lar- 
ry. They’ve got better than 
three thousand square feet in 
the main dome and better 
than twelve hundred square 
feet in each of the two little 
ones. And there’s only seven 
of them right now. That’s 
living.” 

“They’ve been here six 
years longer, after all.” 
“Finogenov had a clay sam- 
ovar sent up. Lemon and nut- 
meg, too. Real, by God, fresh 
lemons for the tea, the last 
time I was there. His own of- 
fice is about ten by ten. 
Think of that. One hundred 
square feet. And a wooden 
desk. A wooden desk. And a 
chair. A wooden chair. Eve- 
rything big and heavy. Eve- 
rything. Weight, hell. Fifty 
pounds more or less — ” 

“They’ve got the power- 
plants for it.” 

“Do you think he did that 
deliberately?” Major Win- 
ship asked. “I think he’s try- 
ing to force us off. I think he 
hoped for the quake. Gagar- 
by Kris Neville 




in's built to take it, I'll say 
that. Looks like it, anyhow. 
You don’t suppose they 
planned this all along? Even 
if they didn’t, they sure got 
the jump on us again, didn’t 
they? I told you what he told 
me?” 

“You told me,” Capt. Wil- 
kins said. 

A FTER a moment, Major 
Winship said bitterly, 
“To hell with the Russian en- 
gineer.” 

“If you’ve got all that pow- 
er ... ” 

“That’s the thing. That’s 
the thing that gripes me, 
know what I mean? It’s just 
insane to send up a heavy 
wooden desk. That’s showing 
off. Like a little kid.” 

“Maybe they don’t make 
aluminum desks.” 

“They’ve — got — alumi- 
num. Half of everything on 
the whole planet is aluminum. 
You know they’re just show- 
ing off.” 

“Let me wire you up,” 
Capt. Wilkins said. “We 
ought to report.” 

“That’s going to take 
awhile.” 

“It’s something to do while 
we wait.” 

“I guess we ought to.” Ma- 
jor Winship came down from 
the bunk and sat with his 
back toward the transmitter. 
Capt. Wilkins slewed the 
equipment around until the 
emergency jacks were acces- 
sible. He unearthed the ap- 
propriate cable and began un- 

the winning of the moon 



screwing the exterior plate to 
the small transmitter-receiver 
set on Major Winship’s back. 
Eventually, trailing wires. 
Major Winship was coupled 
into the network. “Okay?” 
“Okay,” Major Winship 
gestured. 

They roused Earth. 

“This is Major Charles 
Winship, Commanding Offi- 
cer, Freedom 19, the Ameri- 
can moonbase.” 

At this point, Major Win- 
ship observed for the first 
time that he was now on 
emergency air. He started to 
ask Capt. Wilkins to change 
his air bottle, but then he real- 
ized his communications were 
cut off. He reached over and 
rapped Capt. Wilkin’s helmet. 

“This is the Cape. Come 
in, Capt. Winship.” 

“Just a moment.” 

“Is everything all right?” 
Major Winship was squirm- 
ing nervously, obviously per- 
turbed. 

“A-Okay,” he said. “Just a 
moment.” 

“What’s wrong?” came the 
worried question. In the back- 
ground, he heard someone 
say, “I think there’s some- 
thing wrong.” 

Capt. Wilkins peered in- 
tently. Major Winship con- 
torted his face in a savage 
grimace. 

Capt. Wilkins raised his 
eyebrows in alarm. They 
were face to face through 
their helmets, close together. 
Each face appeared mon- 
strously large to the other. 

35 




Major Winship made a 
strangling motion and 
reached for his throat. One 
arm tangled a cable and 
jerked the speaker jack loose. 
Major Winship could no 
longer hear the alarmed ex- 
pressions from the Cape. The 
effort was not entirely sub- 
vocal, since he emitted a lit- 
tle gasping cry in involun- 
tary realism. 

This, in the course of some 
90 seconds, was transmitted 
to Earth. 

Capt. Wilkins’s lips were 
desperately forming the word 
“Leak?” 

Air, Major Winship said si- 
lently. 

Leak ? 

Bottle! Bottle! Bottle! It 
was a frog-like, unvocal ex- 
pletive. 

C OMPREHENSION 
dawned. Capt. Wilkins 
nodded and started to turn 
away. Major Winship caught 
his arm and nodded his head 
toward the loose jack. 

Oh. 

Capt. Wilkins nodded and 
smiled. He, reached across 
and plugged the speaker in 
again. 

“...Freedom 19! Hello, 
Freedom 19! Come in!” 

“We’re here,” Major Win- 
ship said. 

“All right? Are you all 
right ?” 

“We’re all right. A-Okay” 
Major Winship, mindful of 
the extent of his potential 
audience, took a deep breath. 



“Earlier this morning, the 
Soviet Union fired an. .under- 
ground atomic device for the 
ostensible purpose of inves- 
tigating the composition of 
the lunar mass by means of 
seismic analysis of the result-? 
ant shock waves. This was 
done in spite of American 
warnings that such a disturb- 
ance might release ac^\imu^ 
lated stresses in the long un- 
disturbed satellite, and was 
done in the face of vigorous 
American protests.” 

Capt. Wilkins tapped his 
helmet and gestured for him 
to swivel around. The turn 
was uncomfortably tight and 
complicated by the restrain- 
ing cables. Capt. Wilkins be- 
gan replacement of the air 
bottle. 

“These protests have 
proved well founded,” Major 
Winship continued. “Immedi- 
ately following the detona- 
tion, Freedom 19 was called 
on to withstand a moderately 
severe shifting of the Lunar 
surface. No personnel were 
injured and there was no 
equipment damage.” 

Capt. Wilkins tapped his 
shoulder to indicate the new 
air bottle was being inserted. 
Another tap indicated it was 
seated. Major Winship flicked 
the appropriate chest button 
and nodded in appreciation. 

“However,” he continued, 
“we did experience a minor 
leak in the dome, which is 
presently being repaired.” 

“The Soviet Union” came 
the reply, “has reported the

disturbance and has tendered 
their official apology. You 
want it?” 

“It can wait until later. 
Send it by mail for all I care. 
Vacuum has destroyed our or- 
ganic air reconditioner. We 
have approximately three 
weeks of emergency air. How- 
ever, Base Gagarin reports 
no damage, so that, in the 
event we exhaust our air, we 
will be able to obtain the 
necessary replacement.” 

The wait of a little better 
than three seconds for the re- 
sponse gave the conversation 
a tone of deliberation. 

A new voice came on. “We 
tried to contact you earlier, 
Major. We will be able to de- 
liver replacements in about 
ten days.” 

“I will forward a coded re- 
port on the occurrence,” Ma- 
jor Winship said. 

“Let us hear from you again 
in. .about three hours. Is the 
leak repaired?” 

“The leak has not yet been 
repaired. Over and out.” 

He nodded to Capt. Wil- 
kins and leaned back. 

Methodically, Capt. Wil- 
kins set about disconnecting 
the major from the transmit- 
ter. 

“Wow!” said Major Win- 
ship when he was once more 
in communication. “Fat a 
moment there, I though?. ” 

“What?” Capt. Wilkins 
asked with interest. 

“I could see myself asking 
them to ask the Russians to 
ask Finogenov to get on the 

THE WINNING OF THE MOON 



emergency channel to ask you 
to charge the air bottle. I nev- 
er felt so... idiotic is not 
quite strong enough ... there 
for a minute in my whole life. 
I didn’t know how much 
emergency air was left, and 
I thought, my God, I'll never 
live this down. All the hams 
in the world listening, while 
I try to explain the situation. 
I could see the nickname be- 
ing entered in my files: aka. 
The Airless Idiot. I tell you, 
that was rough.” 

Ill 

C APT. LAWLER and Lt. 

Chandler returned with 
the calking compound. It oc- 
cupied the rear section of the 
land car. Lt. Chandler sat 
atop it. It was a fifty-five gal- 
lon drum. 

The airlock to Freedom 19 
was open. “What is that?” 
asked Major Winship, squint- 
ing out into the glaring sun- 
light. 

“That,” said Capt. Lawler, 
“is the calking compound.” 
“You’re kidding,” said Capt. 
Wilkins. 

“I am not kidding.” 

Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chan- 
dler came inside. Capt. Wil- 
kins mounted a bunk. 

“Why didn’t you just bor- 
row a cupful?” Major Win- 
ship said sarcastically. 

“It’s this way,” Lt. Chan- 
dler said. “They didn’t have 
anything but 55-gallon drums 
of it.” 

“Oh, my,” said Capt. Wil- 
kins. “I suppose it’s a steel 

37 




drum. Those things must 
weigh. 

"Actually, I think you guys 
have got the general wrong,” 
Capt. Lawler said. "He was 
out, himself, to greet us. I 
think he was really quite up- 
set by the quake. Probably be- 
cause his people had misfig- 
ured so bad.” 

"He’s too damned suspi- 
cious,” Major Winship said. 
"You know and I know why 
they set that blast off. I tried 
to tell him. Hell. He looks at 
me like an emasculated owl 
and wants to know our ulteri- 
or motive in trying to prevent 
a purely scientific experi- 
ment, the results of which 
will be published in the tech- 
nical press for the good of 
everybody. I’ll bet!” 

"About this drum,” Capt. 
Wilkins said. 

"Well, like I said, it’s this 
way,” Lt. Chandler resumed. 
"I told him we needed about 
a pint. Maybe a quart. But! 
this stuff you have to mix up. 
He only had these drums. 
There’s two parts to it, and 
you have to combine them in 
just the right proportion. He 
told me to take a little 
scale — ” 

"A little scale?” asked 
Capt. Wilkins, rolling his 
eyes at the dome. 

"That’s what I told him. 
We don’t have any little 
scale.” 

"Yeah,” said Captain Law- 
ler, "and he looked at us with 
that mute, surprised look, 
like everybody, everywhere 

38 * 



has dozens of little scales.” 

"Well, anyway,” Lt. Chan- 
dler continued, "he told us 
just to mix up the whole fifty- 
five gallon drum. There’s a 
little bucket of stuff that goes 
in, and it’s measured just 
right. We can throw away 
what we don’t need.” 

"Somehow, that sounds like 
him,” Major Winship said. 

"He had five or six of 
them.” 

"Jesus!” said Capt. Wil- 
kins. "That must be three 
thousand pounds of calking 
compound. Those people are 
insane.” 

"The question is,” Capt. 
Lawler said, " ‘How are we 
going to mix it?’ It’s sup- 
posed to be mixed thorough- 

iy.” 

They thought over the 
problem for a while. 

"That will be a man-sized 
job,” Major Winship said. 

"Let’s see, Charlie. Maybe 
not too bad,” said Capt. Wil- 
kins. "If I took the compres- 
sor motor, we could make up 
a shaft and... let’s see... if 
we could. 

I T took the better part of an 
hour to rig up the electric 
mixer. 

Capt. Wilkins was profuse- 
ly congratulated. 

"Now,” Major Winship 
said, "we can either bring the 
drum inside or take the mixer 
out there.” 

"We’re going to have to 
bring the drum in,” Capt. 
Wilkins said. 



by Kris Neville 




•'Well,* said Capt. Lawler, 
"that will make it nice and 
cozy.* 

It took the four of them to 
roll the drum inside, rocking 
it back and forth through the 
airlock. At that time, it was 
apparent the table was inter- 
posing itself. 

Lt. Chandler tried to dis- 
mantle the table. "Damn these 
suits,” he said. 

"You’ve got it stuck be- 
tween the bunk post.” 

"I know that.” 

"I don’t think this is the 
way to do it,” Major Win- 
ship said. "Let’s back the 
drum out.” 

Reluctantly, they backed 
the drum out and deposited 
it. With the aid of Capt. 
Lawler, Lt. Chandler got the 
table unstuck. They passed it 
over to Major Winship, who 
handed it out to Capt. Wil- 
kins. Captain Wilkins carried 
it around the drum of calking 
compound and set it down. It 
rested uneasily on the uneven 
surface. 

"Now, let’s go,” said Major 
Winship. 

Eventually, they accom- 
plished the moving. They 
wedged the drum between the 
main air-supply tank and the 
transmitter. They were all 
perspiring. "It’s not the 
weight, it’s the mass,” said 
Capt.. Wilkins brightly. 

"The hell it isn’t the 
weight,” said Lt. Chandler. 
"That’s heavy.” 

"With my reefer out,” said 
Major Winship, "I’m the one 

THE WINNING OF THE MOON 



it’s rough on.” He shook per- 
spiration out of his eyes. 
"They should figure a way 
to get a mop in here, or a 
towel, or a sponge, or some- 
thing. I’ll bet you’ve forgot- 
ten how much sweat stings in 
the eyes.” 

"It’s the salt.” 

"Speaking of salt. I wish I 
had some salt tablets,” Major 
Winship said. "I’ve never 
sweat so much since basic.” 
"Want to bet Finogenov 
hasn’t got a bushel of them?” 
"No !” Major Winship 
snapped. 

W ITH the drum of calking 
compound inside, both 
Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chan- 
dler retreated to the bunks. 
Capt. Wilkins maneuvered 
the mixing attachment. "I feel 
crowded,” he said. 

"Cozy’s the word.” 

"Watch it! Watch it! You 
almost hit me in the face 
plate with that!” 

"Sorry.” 

At length the mixer was in 
operation in the drum. 

"Works perfectly,” said 
Capt. Wilkins proudly. 

"Now what. Skip? The in- 
structions aren’t in English.” 
"You’re supposed to dump 
the bucket of stuff in. Then 
clean the area thoroughly 
around the leak.” 

"With what?” asked Major 
Winship. 

"Sandpaper, I guess.” 

"With sandpaper?” Major 
Winship said, emptying the 
bucket of fluid into the drum.

“We don't have any sand- 
paper." 

“It's been a long day," Capt. 
Wilkins said. 

“Mix it thoroughly," Lt. 
Chandler mused. “I guess that 
means let it mix for about ten 
minutes or so. Then you ap- 
ply it. It sets for service in 
just a little bit, Finogenov 
said. An hour or so, maybe." 

“I hope this doesn’t set on 
exposure to air." 

“No," Capt. Lawler said. “It 
sets by some kind of chemical 
action. General Finogenov 
wasn’t sure of the English 
name for it. Some kind of 
plastic." 

“Let’s come back to how 
we’re going to clean around 
the leak," Major Winship 
said. 

“Say, I — " interrupted Capt. 
Wilkins. There was a trace of 
concern in his voice. “This is 
a hell of a time for this to 
occur to me. I just wasn’t 
thinking, before. You don't 
suppose it's a room-tempera- 
ture-curing epoxy resin , do 
you ?" 

“Larry," said Major Win- 
ship, “I wouldn’t ^ know a 
room-temperature-c u r i n g 
epoxy resin from-r-^V 

“Hey!" exclaimed Capt. 
Wilkins. “The mixer’s 
stopped." He bent forward 
and touched the drum. He 
jerked back. “Ye Gods! that’s 
hot! And it’s harder than a 
rock ! It is an epoxy ! Let’s 
get out of here." 

“Huh?" 

“Out! Out!" 

THE WINNING OF THE MOON 



Major Winship, Lt. Chan- 
dler, and Capt. Lawler, recog- 
nizing the sense of urgency, 
simultaneously glanced at the 
drum. It was glowing cherry 
red. 

“Let’s go!" Capt. Wilkins 
said. 

He and the Major reached 
the airlock at the same time 
and became temporarily en- 
gaged with each other. Move- 
ment was somewhat ungainly 
in the space suits under the 
best of conditions, and now, 
with the necessity for speed, 
was doubly so. The other two 
crashed into them from be- 
hind, and they spewed forth 
from the dome in a tangle of 
arms and legs. 

At the table, they separated, 
two going to the left, two to 
the right. The table remained 
untouched. 

When they halted, Capt. 
Wilkins said, “Get to one 
side, it may go off like shrap- 
nel." They obeyed. 

“What — what — what?" 
Capt. Lawler stuttered. 

They were still separated, 
two on one side of the air- 
lock, two on the other. 

“I’m going to try to look," 
Capt. Wilkins said. “Let me 
go." He lumbered directly 
away from the dome for a 
distance of about fifteen feet, 
then turned and positioned 
himself, some five feet behind 
the table, on a line of sight 
with the airlock. 

“I can see it," he said. “It’s 
getting redder. It’s. .it's. 
melting, yes. Melting down at 

41 




the bottom a little. Now it’s 
falling over to one side and 
laying on the air tank. The 
air tank is getting red, too. 
I’m afraid. .it’s weakening 
it... Redder. Oh, oh.” 

“What?” said Capt. Lawler. 

“W a t c h out ! There. 
There r Capt. Wilkins 
leaped from his position. He 
was still floating toward the 
ground when there was an in- 
credibly bright flare from in- 
side the dome, and a great, si- 
lent tongue of flame lashed 
through the airlock and rolled 
across the lunar surface. The 
table was sent tumbling. The 
flame was gone almost in- 
stantly. 

’’There went the air,” Capt. 
Lawler commented. 

“We got T-Trouble,” said 
Lt. Chandler. 

IV 

D URING the fifteen-minute 
wait before they dared 
venture back, Capt. Wilkins, 
interrupted once by what ap- 
peared to be a moderately 
mild after-shock from the pre- 
vious moonquake, explained 
the phenomena they had just 
observed. 

“A room-temperature-curing 
epoxy liberates heat during 
its curing reaction. And the 
hotter it is when you mix it, 
the faster it reacts. The drum 
had been absorbing heat out 
here for several hours much 
faster than it could radiate it 
away. It may have been forty 
or fifty degrees C when we 
stirred in the curing agent. 



At that temperature, a pound 
mass will normally kick over 
in five or ten minutes. But 
here, the only way it can lose 
the reaction heat is by the 
slow process of radiation. And 
that means as the heat builds 
up, the epoxy goes faster and 
faster, building up even more 
heat. And furthermore, we’re 
not talking about a pound, 
which can maybe get up to 
250 C. in air. We’re talking 
about 500 pounds, liberating 
five hundred times as much 
heat as one pound, and getting 
God knows how hot—” 

“I sure wish you’d have told 
me this a little bit earlier,” 
Major Winship said. “I cer- 
tainly wish you’d told me.” 

Capt. Wilkins said, “Hon- 
est, it never occurred to me 
Finogenov would be dumb 
enough to tell us to mix a 
whole drum of epoxy.” 

Major Winship began to 
curse mechanically. 

“I don’t think he did it de- 
liberately, Charlie. I really 
don’t,” Captain Lawler said. 
“I don’t think he knew any 
better. Maybe he was showing 
off by giving us a whole 
drum. Hell, I know he was 
showing off. But something 
like that could kill somebody, 
and I don’t think he’d go that 
far.” 

“Think it’s safe, yet?” Ma- 
jor Winship asked. He was 
perspiring freely again. “I 
need some thermal protec- 
tion. What’ll we do? You 
know damned well. We’ll 
have to go live with them.

Arid that sticks in my craw, 
gentlemen. That — sticks — in 
my — craw/’ 

“There’s nothing for it,” 
Capt. Wilkins said helpfully. 

“Let me go in and survey 
the damage,” Lt. Chandler 
said. 

“That’s my job,” Major 
Winship said. “I’ve got to go 
in anyway.” He lumbered 
through the airlock and 
stepped into the total dark- 
ness through the razor-edge 
curtain. 

“I see it glowing, still,” he 
said. “It's almost as bad in 
here as out there, now. I 
guess it’s okay. Come on. 
Let’s bumble around finding 
the air bottles for the suits 
and get over there before I’m 
a boiled lobster. Not only is 
my reefer out, so’s my light.” 

“Coming.” 

An air of urgency began to 
accumulate. 

“What are we going to do 
with him? It’s a half-hour run 
over there.” 

“Think you can make it, 
Charlie?” 

“I’m damned well hot.” 

“Charlie, come out here. In 
the car. Skip, you get 'the bot- 
tles. You drive.” 

Major Winship came out. 
“Lay down in back,” Capt. 
Wilkins said. “Les, you lay 
down beside him. I’ll lay on 
top of him. I think we can 
shield him pretty good that 
way.” 

“That’s good thinking,” 
Capt. Lawler said from in- 
side. 



The operation was not easi- 
ly executed. Lt. Chandler got 
in first, and then Major Win- 
ship squeezed beside him. 
“Careful, there,” he said as 
Capt. Wilkins came aboard. 

Capt. Wilkins's foot rolled 
off one of Major Winship's 
thighs. 

“Watch it!” 

“I am.” 

“Oops !” 

“Ufff! I felt that. Ugh. 
Thank God for the way these 
are built.” 

“How’s that?” Capt. Wil- 
kins asked. 

“I guess... It’s okay, I 
guess.” 

“Cooler?” 

“It’s too soon to tell. Man, 
I’ll bet we look silly.” 

Capt. Lawler came out with 
the bottles and studied his 
companions for a moment. 

“See if we can get up and 
over a little more, Les.” 

“This okay?” 

“B e t t e r. How’s it feel, 
Charlie?” 

"Okay.” 

Cant. Lawler deposited the 
air bottles. “Everyone got 
enough air?” 

"I guess we’re all okay,” 
Capt. Wilkins said; 

“Don’t we look silly?” Ma- 
jor Winship asked plaintive- 
ly. “I can’t possibly describe 
my emotions at this minute.” 
“You look all right,” Capt. 
Lawler said. “Still hot?” 
Major Winship grunted. 
He said nothing. 

“I’ll get there as fast as I 

ran 



THE WINNING OF THE MOON 



43 . 




A FTER about ten minutes 
jarring across the lunar 
surface, Major Winship said, 
"Fm not appreciably cooler; 
but then I'm not appreciably 
hotter, either." 

"Shut up, Charlie. You’re a 
thirty-year man," Lt. Chan- 
dler said. 

"Old soldiers never die, 
they just become desiccated." 

"I’d like a beer," Major 
W in ship said. "A cold, 
frosty, foamy beer. Big collar. 
Gimme a beer, a little shaker 
of salt — * 

"Finogenov’s probably got 
eight or ten cases." 

"For once, I hope you’re 
right. Try to bounce a little 
easier, Larry." 

"R u s s i a n s don’t drink 
beer," Lt. Chandler said. 

"You sure?" 

"Vodka," Capt Lawler 
grunted. 

"They drink champagne, 
you idiots," Capt. Wilkins 
said. 

"Beggars can’t be choos- 
ers," Major Winship said. 
"Champagne is okay by me. 
if it’s just cold." 

"Finogenov will have a few 
hundred pounds of ice.’’ 

"Cut it out," Major Win- 
ship said. 

"Boy, you wait till we get 
you back to Earth. When it 
comes time to reup, I’m going 
to be there. I’m going to re- 
mind you of this one.” 

"You’re a thirty-year man, 
too, Les,” Major Winship 
said. 

"Not me," Lt. Chandler 

44 



said. "I’ve had it, dad. Fm go- 
ing to sell my life story to 
the movies and spend the rest 
of my life eating popcorn and 
watching what an idiot I was. 
A man can get hurt up here.” 

"So you want to be a 
civilian?" 

"You’re damned right I do," 
Lt. Chandler said. 

"We’re about there,” Capt. 
Lawler cut in. "You still 
okay, Charlie?" 

"Fine." 

"Here’s the little ridge, 
then. Hold on, we’re taking 
the angle up. You riding 
okay, Charlie?" 

"Fine, Skip.” 

After a moment, Capt. Law- 
ler said, "I see the base now. 
The top. Hey!” He slammed 
on the brakes. "Oh, no! Those 
...those fools! Those idiots." 

"What’s wrong?” Major 
Winship demanded. "Skip — 
what’s wrong?” 

"The second little dome is 
down. It wasn’t that way a 
couple of hours ago. And 
they’ve block-and-tackled a 
drum of calking compound up 
on the main dome.” 

“We've got to stop them!” 
Major Winship cried. "Skip! 
Skip!’? > 

"Charlie, there’s nothing 
we can do. The drum’s just 
starting to turn red.” 

There was silence for a 
while. 

"It’s melting through, now. 
There it goes. Down through 
the dome. Out of sight.” Af- 
ter a moment, Capt. Lawler 
continued. "Funny how 

by Kris Nevills 




things fall so slowly under 
this low gravity. It floated 
through their dome just like 
a feather. You should have 
seen it.” 

Eventually, Lt. Chandler 
said, “Boys, this is my last 
hitch.” 

There was more silence. 

Capt. Wilkins mused, “I 
guess they didn’t have a lit- 
tle scale either.” 

Someone was breathing 
loudly. At length, Major 
Winship said reflectively, 
“Why do you suppose they 
would try to calk it from the 
outside?” 

Again silence. Major Win- 
ship asked the question. 
“Okay. Let’s have it. How’s 
the other little dome?” 

“Other one? Oh, sorry,” 
Capt. Lawler said. “It looks 
all right.” 

“It better be all right,” Lt. 
Chandler said. 

I N the end, the eleven of 
them were crowded into 
the one remaining operation- 
al structure of the four avail- 
able on the moon at sunrise. 

For perhaps the tenth time, 
General Finogenov offered 
his apologies. He and Major 
Winship were huddled side 
by side in a corner. They 
were drinking vodka. 

“Plenty of everything,” 
General Finogenov said. 
“Don’t concern yourself, Ma- 
jor. Air, food, water, we have 
more than enough for a pro- 
longed siege.” 

“Accidents will happen.” 

THE WINNING OF THE MOON 



“Exactly,” said General 
Finogenov, pouring more 
vodka for himself. “Glad you 
understand.” He put the emp- 
ty bottle down. “We will have 
another one next week. In the 
meantime — I very much re- 
gret the inconvenience. Plen- 
ty of food, water, air, though. 
Pinov! Pinov! Vodka!” 

Pinov answered in Russian. 
General Finogenov 
frowned. “Dear, dear,” he 
said. “I’m afraid this must be 
our last one, Major. You see, 
while we have plenty of 
everything else, we are, you 
see... The truth of the mat- 
ter is, we didn’t foresee visi- 
tors. Unfortunately, we have 
no more vodka.” 

“No more vodka,” said Gen- 
eral Finogenov. He stared 
morosely into the inky dis- 
tance. “Major Winship, I 
have a confession. Oh, that 
second one was a beauty. You 
didn’t feel it?” 

“Our leak sprang on the 
first one. The second was 
quite mild, we thought.” 

“We were right on the 
fault line,” General Finoge- 
nov said. “As you Americans 
say, it was a beauty. I have a 
confession. One must admit 
one's mistakes.” 

“Yes?” 

“We used much too large a 
bomb,” he said. 

“I’m with you,” Lt. Chan- 
dler chimed in from some- 
where out of the darkness. 
“But when do you think 
you’re going to get the lights 
fixed?” END

IF • Short Story 



AND THEN THERE 
WAS PEACE 



BY GORDON R. DICKSON 



A T nine hundred hours 
there were explosions off 
to the right at about seven 
hundred yards. At eleven hun- 
dred hours the slagger came 
by to pick up the casualties 
among the gadgets. Charlie 
saw the melting head at the 
end of its heavy beam going 
up and down like the front 
end of a hardworking chicken 
only about fifty yards west of 
his foxhole. Then it worked 
its way across the battlefield 
for about half an hour and, 
loaded down with melted 
forms of damaged robots, of 
all shapes and varieties, dis- 
appeared behind the low hill 
to the west, and left, of Char- 
lie. It was a hot August day 
somewhere in or near Ohio, 
with a thunderstorm coming 



Peace is well worth dying 
for ... it had better be! 



on. There was that yellow col- 
or in the air. 

At twelve hundred hours 
the chow gadget came ticking 
over the redoubt behind the 
foxhole. It crawled into the 
foxhole, jumped up on the 
large table and opened itself 
out to reveal lunch. The menu 
this day was liver and onions, 
whole corn, whipped potato 
and raspberries. 

“And no whip cream/' said 
Charlie. 

“You haven’t been doing 
your exercises," said the chow 
gadget in a fine soprano voice. 

“I’m a front-line soldier," 
said Charlie. “I’m an infantry- 
man in a foxhole overlooking 
ground zero. I'll be damned if 
I take exercises.” 

“In any case, there is no 





excuse for not shaving.” 

“I'll be damned if I shave.” 
“But why not shave? 
Wouldn’t it be better than 
having that itchy, scratchy 
beard — ” 

“No,” said Charlie. He went 
around back of the chow 
gadget and began to take its 
rear, plate off. 

“What are you doing to 
me?” said the chow gadget. 

“You’ve got something 
stuck to you here,” said Char- 
lie. “Hold still.” He surrepti- 
tiously took a second out to 
scratch at his four-day beard. 
“There’s a war on, you know.” 
“I know that,” said the chow 
gadget. “Of course.” 

“Infantrymen like me are 
dying daily.” 

“Alas,” said the chow gadg- 
et, in pure, simple tones. 

“To say nothing,” said 
Charlie, setting the rear plate 
to one side, “of the expend- 
iture of you technical devices. 
Not that there’s any compari- 
son between human lives and 
the wastage of machines.” 
“Of course not.” 

“So how can any of you, no 
matter how elaborate your 
computational systems, under- 
stand — ” Charlie broke off to 
poke among the innards of the 
chow machine. 

«T~\0 not damage me,” it 
L' said. 

“Not if I can help it,” said 
Charlie. “ — understand what it 
feels like to a man sitting here 
day after day, pushing an oc- 
casional button, never know- 



ing the results of his button 
pushing, and living in a sort 
of glass-case comfort except 
for the possibility that he may 
just suddenly be dead — sud- 
denly, like that, before he 
knows it.” He broke off to 
probe again. “It’s no life for 
a man.” 

“Terrible, terrible,” said the 
chow gadget. “But there is 
still hope for improvement.” 

“Don’t hold your breath,” 
said Charlie. “There’s — ah !” 
He interrupted himself, pull- 
ing a small piece of paper out 
of the chow gadget. 

“Is there something the mat- 
ter?” said the chow gadget. 

“No,” said Charlie. He 
stepped over to the observa- 
tion window and glanced out. 
The slagger was making its 
return. It was already within 
about fifty yards of the fox- 
hole. “Not a thing,” said Char- 
lie. “As a matter of fact, the 
war’s over.” 

“How interesting,” said the 
chow gadget. 

“That’s right,” said Charlie. 
“Just let me read you this lit- 
tle billet-doux I got from Fox- 
hole thirty-four. Meet you 
back at the bar , Charlie. It's 
all over. Your hunch that we 
could get a message across was 
the clear quill. Answer came 
today the same way , through 
the international weather re- 
ports. They want to quit as 
well as we do. Peace is agreed 
on, and the gadgets — ” Char- 
lie broke off to look at the 
chow gadget. “That’s you, 
along with the rest of them.” 



AND THEN THERE WAS PEACE 



47 




“Quite right. Of course/* 
said the chow gadget. 

“ — have already accepted 
the information. Well be out 
of here by sundown. And that 
takes care of the war.” 

“It does indeed/' said the 
chow gadget. “Hurrah! And 
farewell." 

“Farewell? said Charlie. 

“You will be returning to 
civilian life," said the chow 
gadget. “I will be scrapped." 

“That’s right," said Charlie. 
“I remember the preprogram- 
ing for the big units. This 
war’s to be the last, they were 
programe d. Well—" said 
Charlie. For a moment he hes- 
itated. “What d’you know? I 
may end up missing you a lit- 
tle bit, after all." 

He glanced out the window. 
The slagger was almost to the 
dugout. 

“Well, well," he said. “Now 
that the time’s come. .we did 
have quite a time together, 
three times a day. No more 
string beans, huh?" 

“I bet not," said the chow 
gadget with a little laugh. 

“No more caramel pudding." 

“I guess so." 

J UST then the slagger halted 
outside, broke the thick 
concrete roof off the dugout 
and laid it carefully aside. 

“Excuse me," it said, its 
cone-shaped melting head 
nodding politely some fifteen 
feet above Charlie. “The war’s 
over." 

“I know," said Charlie. 
“Now there will be peace. 



There are orders that all in- 
struments of war are to be 
slagged and stockpiled for 
later peaceful uses." It had 
a fine baritone voice. “Excuse 
me," it said, “but are you fin- 
ished with that chow gadget 
there?" 

“You haven’t touched a 
bite," said the chow gadget. 
“Would you like just a small 
spoonful of raspberries?" 

“I don't think so," said 
Charlie, slowly. “No, I don’t 
think so." 

“Then farewell," said the 
chow gadget. “I am now ex- 
pendable." 

The melting head of the 
slagger dipped toward the 
chow gadget. Charlie opened 
his mouth suddenly, but be- 
fore he could speak, there was 
a sort of invisible flare from 
the melting head and the chow 
gadget became a sort of pud- 
dle of metal which the melt- 
ing head picked up magneti- 
cally and swung back to the 
hopper behind it. 

“Blast it!" said Charlie with 
feeling. “I could just as well 
have put in a request to keep 
the darn thing for a souvenir." 

The heavy melting head 
bobbed apologetically back. 

“I’m afraid that wouldn’t be 
possible," it said. “The order 
allows no exceptions. All mili- 
tary instruments are to be 
slagged and stockpiled." 

“Well — " said Charlie. But 
it was just about then that he 
noticed the melting head was 
descending toward him. END

What’s the principal cause 
of headaches? Why, having 
THE a head, of course! 

BIG HEADACHE 

BY JIM HARMON Illustrated by Dyas 



T 

4£|HYO you think we’ll have 
' * to use force on Macklin 
to get him to cooperate in the 
experiment ?” Ferris asked 
eagerly. 

“How are you going to go 
about forcing him, Doctor?’’ 
Mitchell inquired. “He out- 
weighs you by fifty pounds 
and you needn’t look to me 
for help against that' repatri- 
ated fullback.” 

Ferris fingered the collar of 
his starched lab smock. “Guess 
I got carried away for a mo- 
ment. But Macklin is exactly 
what we need for a quick, 
dramatic test. We’ve had it if 
he turns us down.” 

“I know,” Mitchell said, ex- 
haling deeply. “Somehow the 



men with the money just can’t 
seem to understand basic re- 
search. Who would have fi- 
nanced a study of cyclic pe- 
riods of the hedgehog? Yet 
the information gained from 
that study is vital in cancer 
research.” 

“When we prove our results 
that should be of enough prac- 
tical value for anyone. But 
those crummy trustees didn’t 
even leave us enough for a 
field test.” Ferris scrubbed 
his thin hand over the bony 
ridge of his forehead. “I’ve 
been worrying so much about 
this I’ve got the ancestor of 
all headaches.” 

Mitchell’s blue eyes nar- 
rowed and his boyish face 
took on an expression of de- 
monic intensity. “Ferris, 



49 





would you consider — ?” 

‘‘No!” the smaller man 
yelled. “You can’t expect me 
to violate professional ethics 
and test my own discovery 
on myself/' 

“Our discovery,” Mitchell 
said politely. 

“That’s what I meant to say. 
But I'm not sure it would be 
completely ethical with even 
a discovery partly mine.” 

“You're right. Besides who 
cares if you or I are cured of 
headaches? Our reputations 
don’t go outside our own 
fields/’ Mitchell said. “But 
now Macklin — ” 

Elliot Macklin had inherit- 
ed the reputation of the late 
Albert Einstein in the popu- 
lar mind. He was the man peo- 
ple thought of when the word 
“mathematician” or even “sci- 
entist” was mentioned. No one 
knew whether his Theory of 
Spatium was correct or not be- 
cause no one had yet been able 
to frame an argument with it. 
Macklin was in his early fif- 
ties but looked in his late 
thirties, with the build of a 
football player. The govern- 
ment took up a lot of his time 
using him as the symbol of 
the Ideal Scientist to help re- 
cruit Science and Engineering 
Cadets. 

For the past seven years 
Macklin — who was the Ad- 
vanced Studies Department of 
Firestone University — had 
been involved in devising a 
faster-than-light drive to help 
the Army reach Pluto and 
eventually the nearer stars. 

SO 



Mitchell had overheard* two 
coeds talking and so knew 
that the project was nearing 
completion. If so, it was a case 
of Ad astra per aspirin. 

The only thing that could 
delay the project was Mack- 
lin's health. 

Despite his impressive body, 
some years before he had suf- 
fered a mild stroke. .or at 
least a vascular spasm of a 
cerebral artery. It was known 
that he suffered from the 
vilest variety of migraine. A 
cycle of the headaches had 
caused him to be absent from 
his classes for several weeks, 
and there were an unusual 
number of military uniforms 
seen around the campus. 

ERRIS paced off the tidy 
measurements of the office 
outside the laboratory in the 
biology building. Mitchell sat 
slumped in the chair behind 
the blond imitation wood 
desk, watching him disinter- 
estedly. 

“Do you suppose the Great 
Man will actually show up?” 
Ferris demanded, pausing in 
mid-stride. 

“I imagine he will,” Mitch- 
ell said. “Macklin’s always 
seemed a decent enough fel- 
low when I’ve had lunch with 
him or seen him at the trustees 
meetings.” 

“He’s always treated me like 
dirt,” Ferris said heatedly. 
“Everyone on this campus 
treats biologists like dirt. 
Sometimes I want to bash in 
their smug faces.” 

THZ BIG HEADACHE 





Sometimes, Mitchell re- 
flected, Ferris displayed a 
certain lack of scientific de- 
tachment. 

There came a discreet knock 
on the door. 

‘Please come in/' Mitchell 
said. 

Elliot Macklin entered in a 
cloud of pipe smoke and a 
tweed jacket. He looked more 
than a little like a postgradu- 
ate student, and Mitchell sus- 
pected that that was his in- 
tention. 

He shook hands warmly 
with Mitchell. “Good of you 
to ask me over, Steven/' 

Macklin threw a big arm 
across Ferris’ shoulders. “How 
have you been, Harold?" 

Ferris’ face flickered be- 
tween pink and white. “Fine, 
thank you, doctor." 

Macklin dropped on the 
edge of the desk and adjusted 
his pipe. “Now what’s this 
about you wanting my help 
on something? And please 
keep the explanation simple. 
Biology isn’t my field, you 
know." 

Mitchell moved around the 
desk casually. “Actually, Doc- 
tor, we haven’t the. right to 
ask this of a man of your im- 
portance. There may be an ele- 
ment of risk." 

The mathematician clamped 
onto his pipe and showed his 
teeth. “Now you have me in- 
trigued. What is it all about?" 

“Doctor, we understand you 
have severe headaches," 
Mitchell said. 

Macklin nodded. “That’s 



right, Steven. Migraine." 

“That must be terrible," 
Ferris said. “All your fine 
reputation and lavish salary 
can’t be much consolation 
when that ripping, tearing 
agony begins, can it?" 

“No, Harold, it isn’t," Mack- 
lin admitted. “What does your 
project have to do with my 
headaches?" 

“Doctor," Mitchell said, 
“what would you say the most 
common complaint of man 
is?" 

“I would have said the com- 
mon cold," Macklin replied, 
“but I suppose from what you 
have said you mean head- 
aches." 



UTTEADACHES," Mitchell 
agreed. “Everybody has 
them at some time in his life. 



Some people have them every 
day. Some are driven to sui- 
cide by their headaches." 

“Yes," Macklin said. 

“But think," Ferris inter- 
jected, “what a boon it would 
be if everyone could be cured 
of headaches forever by one 
simple injection." 

“I don’t suppose the manu- 
facturers of aspirin would 
like you. But it would please 
about everybody else." 

“Aspirins would still be 
used to reduce fever and re- 
lieve muscular pains," Mitch- 
ell said. 



“I see. Are you two saying 
you have such a shot? Can 
you cure headaches?" 

“We think we cao/' Ferris 
said.

"How can you have a spe- 
cific for a number of different 
causes?"’ Macklin asked. "I 
know that much about the sub- 
ject.” 

"There are a number of dif- 
ferent causes for headaches — 
nervous strain, fatigue, physi- 
cal diseases from kidney com- 
plaints to tumors, over-in- 
dulgence — but there is one ef- 
fect of all of this, the one real 
cause of headaches,” Mitchell 
announced. 

"We have definitely estab- 
lished this for this first time,” 
Ferris added. 

"That’s fine,” Macklin said, 
sucking on his pipe. "And this 
effect that produces headaches 
is?” 

"The pressure effect caused 
by pituitrin in the brain,” 
Mitchell said eagerly. "That 
is, the constriction of blood 
vessels in the telencephalon 
section of the frontal lobes. 
It’s caused by an over-produc- 
tion of the pituitary gland. 
We have artificially bred a 
virus that feeds on pituitrin.” 

"That may mean the end of 
headaches, but I would think 
it would mean the end of the 
race as well,” Macklin said. 
"In certain areas it is valu- 
able to have a constriction of 
blood vessels.” 

"The virus,” Ferris ex- 
plained, "can easily be local- 
ized and stabilized. A colony 
of virus in the brain cells will 
relax the cerebral vessels — 
and only the cerebral vessels — 
so that the cerebrospinal fluid 
doesn’t create pressure in the 
52 



cavities of the brain.” 

The mathematician took the 
pipe out of his mouth. "If this 
really works, I could stop us- 
ing that damned gynergen, 
couldn’t I? The stuff makes 
me violently sick to my stom- 
ach. But it’s better than the 
migraine. How should I go 
about removing my curse ?” 
He reinserted the pipe. 

"I assure you, you can for- 
get ergotamine tartrate,” Fer- 
ris said. "Our discovery will 
work.” 

{{T177ILL work,” Macklin 
W S aid thoughtfully. "The 
operative word. It hasn't 
worked then?” 

"Certainly it has,” Ferris 
said. "On rats, on chimps...” 
"But not on humans?” 
Macklin asked. 

"Not yet,” Mitchell admit- 
ted. 

"Well,” Macklin said. 
"Well.” He thumped pipe 
ashes out into his palm. "Cer- 
tainly you can get volunteers. 
Convicts. Conscientious ob- 
jectors from the Army.” 

"We want you,” Ferris told 
him. 

Macklin coughed. "I don’t 
want to overestimate my value 
but the government wouldn’t 
like it very well if I died in 
the middle of this project. My 
wife would like it even less.” 
Ferris turned his back on 
the mathematician. Mitchell 
could see him mouthing the 
word yellow . 

"Doctor,” Mitchell said 
quickly, "I know it’s a tre- 

THE BIG HEADACHE 




mendous favor to ask of a 
man of your position. But you 
can understand our problem. 
Unless we can produce quick, 
conclusive and dramatic proof 
of our studies we can get no 
more financial backing. We 
should run a large-scale field 
test. But we haven’t the time 
or money for that. We can 
cure the headaches of one per- 
son and that’s the limit of our 
resources.” 

“I’m tempted,” Macklin said 
hesitantly, “but the answer is 
go. I mean *no\ I’d like to help 
you out, but I’m afraid I owe 
too much to others to take the 
rest — the risk, I mean.” 

Macklin ran the back of his 
knuckles across his forehead. 
“I really would like to take 
you up on it. When I start 
making slips like that it means 
another attack of migraine. 
The drilling, grinding pain 
through my temples and 
around my eyeballs. The flash- 
es of light, the rioting pools 
of color playing on the back 
of my lids. Ugh.” 

Ferris smiled. “Gynergen 
makes you sick, does it, doc- 
tor? Produces nausea, eh? The 
pain of that turns you almost 
wrong side out, doesn’t it? 
You aren’t much better off 
with it than without, are you? 
I’ve heard some say they pre- 
ferred the migraine.” 

Macklin carefully arranged 
his pipe along with the tools 
he used to tend it in a worn 
leather case. “Tell me,” he 
said, “what is the worst that 
could happen to me?” 



“Low blood. pressure,” Fer- 
ris said. 

“That’s not so bad,” Mack- 
lin said. “How low can it get?” 

“When your heart stops, 
your blood pressure goes to 
its lowest point,” Mitchell 
said. 

A dew of perspiration had 
bloomed on Macklin’s fore- 
head. “Is there much risk of 
that ?” 

“Practically none,” Mitch- 
ell said. “We have to give you 
the worst possibilities. All our 
test animals survived and 
seem perfectly happy and con- 
tented. As I said, the virus 
is self-stabilizing. Ferris and 
I are confident that there is 
no danger... But we may be 
wrong.” 

Macklin held his head in 
both hands. “Why did you 
two select me?” 

“You’re an important man, 
doctor,” Ferris said. “Nobody 
would care if Mitchell or I 
cured ourselves of headaches 
— they might not even believe 
us if we said we did. But the 
proper authorities will believe 
a man of your reputation. Be- 
sides, neither of us has a rec- 
ord of chronic migraine. You 
do.” 

“Yes, I do,” Macklin said. 
“Very well. Go ahead. Give 
me your injection.” 

Mitchell cleared his throat. 
“Are you positive, doctor?” he 
asked uncertainly. “Perhaps 
you would like a few days to 
think it over.” 

“No! I’m ready. Go ahead, 
right now.”

“There’s a simple release,” 
Ferris said smoothly. 

Macklin groped in his pock- 
et for a pen. 

II 

apERRIS!” Mitchell yelled, 
* slamming the laboratory 
door behind him. 

“Right here,” the small man 
said briskly. He was sitting 
at a work table, penciling 
notes. “I’ve been expecting 
you.” 

“Doctor — Harold — you 
shouldn’t have given this story 
to the newspapers,” Mitchell 
said. He tapped the back of 
his hand against the folded 
paper. 

“On the contrary, I should 
and I did,” Ferris answered. 
“We wanted something dra- 
matic to show to the trustees 
and here it is.” 

“Yes, we wanted to show 
our proof to the trustees — 
but not broadcast unverified 
results to the press. It’s too 
early for that!” 

“Don’t be so stuffy and con- 
servative, Mitchell! Macklin's 
cured, isn’t he? By established 
periodic cycle he should be 
suffering hell right now, 
shouldn’t he? But thanks to 
our treatment he is perfectly 
happy, with no unfortunate 
side effects such as gynergen 
produces.” 

“It’s a significant test case, 
yes. But not enough to go to 
the newspapers with. If it 
wasn’t “enough to go to the 
press with, it wasn’t enough 



to try and breach the 
trustees with. Don’t you see? 
The public will hand down a 
ukase demanding our virus, 
just as they demanded the 
Salk vaccine and the Grennell 
serum.” 

“But — ” 

The shrill call of the tele- 
phone interrupted Mitchell’s 
objections. 

Ferris excused himself and 
crossed to the instrument. He 
answered it and listened for a 
moment, his face growing im- 
patient. 

“It’s Macklin’s wife,” Ferris 
said. “Do you want to talk to 
her? I’m no good with hysteri- 
cal women.” 

“Hysterical?” Mitchell mut- 
tered in alarm and went to the 
phone. 

“Hello?” Mitchell said re- 
luctantly. “Mrs. Macklin?” 
“You are the other one,” the 
clear feminine voice said. 
“Your name is Mitchell.” 

She couldn’t have sounded 
calmer or more self-possessed, 
Mitchell thought. 

“That’s right, Mrs. Macklin. 
I’m Dr. Steven Mitchell, Dr. 
Ferris’s associate.” 

“Do you have a license to 
dispense narcotics?” 

“What do you mean by that, 
Mrs. Macklin,” Mitchell said 
sharply. 

“I used to be a nurse, Dr. 
Mitchell. I know you’ve given 
my husband heroin.” 

“That’s absurd. What makes 
you think a thing like that?” 
“The — trance he’s in now.” 
“Now, Mrs. Macklin. Nei- 



54 



THE BIG HEADACHE 




ther Dr. Ferris or myself have 
been near your husband for a 
full day. The effects of a nar- 
cotic would have worn off by 
this time.” 

‘"Most known narcotics,” she 
admitted, “but evidently you 
have discovered something 
new. Is it so expensive to re- 
fine you and Ferris have to 
recruit new customers to keep 
yourselves supplied?” 

“Mrs. Macklin! I think I 
had better talk to you later 
when you are calmer.” 

Mitchell dropped the receiv- 
er heavily. “What could be 
wrong with Macklin?” he 
asked without removing his 
hand from the telephone. 

Ferris frowned, making 
quotation marks above his 
nose. “Let’s have a look at the 
test animals.” 

Together they marched over 
to the cages and peered 
through the honeycomb pat- 
tern of the wire. The test 
chimp. Dean, was sitting 
peacefully in a corner scratch- 
ing under his arms with the 
back of his knuckles. Jerry, 
their control in the experi- 
ment, who was practically 
Dean’s twin except that he had 
received no injection of the 
E-M Virus, was stomping up 
and down punching his fin- 
gers through the wire, worry- 
ing the lock on the cage. 

“Jerry is a great deal more 
active than Dean,” Mitchell 
said. 

“Yes, but Dean isn’t sick. 
He just doesn’t seem to have 
as much nervous energy to 



burn up. Nothing wrong with 
his thyroid either.” 

They went to the smaller 
cages. They found the situa- 
tion with the rats, Bud and 
Lou, much the same. 

“I don’t know. Maybe they 
just have tired blood,” Mitch- 
ell ventured. 

“Iron deficiency anemia?” 
“Never mind, doctor. It was 
a form of humor. I think we 
had better see exactly what is 
wrong with Elliot Macklin.” 
“There’s nothing wrong 
with him,” Ferris snapped. 
“He’s probably just trying to 
get us in trouble, the ingrate !” 

M ACKLIN’S traditional 
ranch house was small but 
attractive in aqua-tinted alu- 
minum. 

Under Mitchell’s thumb the 
bell chimbed dum-de-de-dum- 
dum-dum. 

As they waited Mitchell 
glanced at Ferris. He seemed 
completely undisturbed, per- 
haps slightly curious. 

The door unlatched and 
swung back. 

“Mrs. Macklin,” Mitchell 
said quickly, “I’m sure we can 
help if there is anything 
wrong with your husband. 
This is Dr. Ferris. I am Dr. 
Mitchell.” 

“You had certainly better 
help him, gentlemen.” She 
stood out of the doorway for 
them to pass. 

Mrs. Macklin was an attrac- 
tive brunette in her late thir- 
ties. She wore an expensive 
yellow dress. And she had a

55 




sharp-cornered jawline. 

The Army officer came out 
into the hall to meet them. 

“You are the gentlemen who 
gave Dr. Macklin the unau- 
thorized injection,” he said. 

It wasn’t a question. 

“I don’t like that ‘unauthor- 
ized’,” Ferris snapped. 

The colonel — Mitchell 
spotted the eagles on his 
green tunic — lifted a heavy 
eyebrow. “No? Are you medi- 
cal doctors? Are you author- 
ized to treat illnesses?” 

“We weren’t treating an ill- 
ness,” Mitchell said. “We were 
discovering a method of treat- 
ment. What concern is it of 
yours?” 

The colonel smiled thinly. 
“Dr. Macklin is my concern. 
And everything that happens 
to him. The Army doesn't like 
what you have done to him.” 

Mitchell wondered desper- 
ately just what they had done 
to the man. 

“Can we see him?” Mitchell 
asked. 

“Why not? You can’t do 
much worse than murder him 
now. That might be just as 
well. We have laws to cover 
that.” 

The colonel led them into 
the comfortable, over-feminine 
living room. Macklin sat in an 
easy chair draped in embroi- 
dery, smoking. Mitchell sud- 
denly realized Macklin used 
a pipe as a form of masculine 
protest to his home surround- 
ings. 

On the coffee table in front 
of Macklin were some odd- 

56 



shaped building blocks such as 
were used in nursery schools. 
A second uniformed man — 
another colonel but with the 
snake-entwined staff of the 
medical corps in his insignia — 
was kneeling at the table on 
the marble-effect carpet. 

The Army physician stood 
up and brushed his knees, un- 
dusted from the scrupulously 
clean rug. 

“What’s wrong with him, 
Sidney?” the other officer 
asked the doctor. 

“Not a thing,” Sidney said. 
“He’s the healthiest, happiest, 
most well-adjusted man I've 
ever examined, Carson.” 

“But — ” Colonel Carson pro- 
tested. 

“Oh, he’s changed all right,” 
the Army doctor answered. 
“He’s not the same man as he 
used to be.” 

“How is he different?” 
Mitchell demanded. 

The medic examined Mitch- 
ell and Ferris critically before 
answering. “He used to be a 
mathematical genius.” 

“And now?” Mitchell said 
impatiently. 

“Now he is a moron,” the 
medic said. 

Ill 

M itchell tried to stop 
Colonel Sidney as he 
went past, but the doctor 
mumbled he had a report to 
make. 

Mitchell and Ferris stared 
at Colonel Carson and Macklin 
and at each other. 

THE BIG HEADACHE 




“What did he mean, Mack- 
lin is an idiot ?” Mitchell 
asked. 

“Not an idiot,” Colonel Car- 
son corrected primly. “Dr. 
Macklin is a moron. He’s le- 
gally responsible, but he’s ex- 
tremely stupid.” 

“I’m not so dumb,” Macklin 
said defensively. 

“I beg your pardon, sir,” 
Carson said. “I didn’t intend 
any offense. But according to 
all the standard intelligence 
tests we have given you, your 
clinical intelligence quotient 
is that of a moron.” 

“That's just on book learn- 
ing,” Macklin said. “There’s a 
lot you learn in life that you 
don’t get out of books, son.” 

“I’m confident that’s true, 
sir,” Colonel Carson said. He 
turned to the two biologists. 
“Perhaps we had better speak 
outside.” 

“But — ’’ Mitchell said, impa- 
tient to examine Macklin for 
himself. “Very well. Let’s step 
into the hall.” 

Ferris followed them docile- 
ly. 

“What have you done to 
him?” the colonel ’ r asked 
straightforwardly. 

“We merely cured him of 
his headaches,” Mitchell said. 

“How?” 

Mitchell did his best to ex- 
plain the F-M Virus. 

“You mean,” the Army offi- 
cer said levelly “you have in- 
fected him with some kind of 
a disease to rot his braiif ?” 

“No, ho ! Could I talk to the 
other man, the doctor? 'Maybe 

by 'Jim Harmon 



I can make him understand.” 

“All I want to know is why 
Elliot Macklin has been made 
as simple as if he had been 
kicked in the head by a mule,” 
Colonel Carson said. 

“I think I can explain,” Fer- 
ris interrupted. 

“You can?” Mitchell said. 

Ferris nodded. “We made a 
slight miscalculation. It ap- 
pears as if the virus colony 
overcontrols the supply of 
posterior pituitary extract in 
the cerebrum. It isn’t more 
than necessary to stop head- 
aches. But that necessary 
amount of control to stop pain 
is too much to allow the brain 
cells to function properly.” 

“Why won’t they function?” 
Carson roared. 

“They don’t get enough 
food — blood, oxygen, hemo- 
globin,” Ferris explained. 
“The cerebral vessels don’t 
contract enough to pump the 
blood through the brain as 
fast and as hard as is needed. 
The brain cells remain slug- 
gish, dormant. Perhaps decay-

in g. 

The colonel yelled. 

Mitchell groaned. He was 
abruptly sure Ferris was cor- 
rect. 

T HE colonel drew himself 
to attention, fists trem- 
bling at his sides. “I’ll see you 
hung for treason! Don’t you 
know what Elliot Matklin 
means to us? Do you Want 
those filthy Luxemburgians to 
reach Pluto before we do? 
Macklin's formula is *ess^n-

tial to the FTL engine. You 
might just as well have blown 
up Washington, D.C. Better! 
The capital is replaceable. But 
the chances of an Elliot Mack- 
lin are very nearly once in a 
human race.” 

“Just a moment,” Mitchell 
interrupted, “we can cure 
Macklin.” 

“You can?” Carson said. For 
a moment Mitchell thought 
the man was going to clasp his 
hands and sink to his knees. 

“Certainly. We have learned 
to stabilize the virus colonies. 
We have antitoxin to combat 
the virus. We had always 
thought of it as a beneficial 
parasite, but we can wipe it 
out if necessary.” 

“Good!” Carson clasped his 
hands and gave at least slight- 
ly at the knees. 

“Just you wait a second 
now, boys,” Elliot Macklin 
said. He was leaning in the 
doorway, holding his pipe. 
“I've been listening to what 
you’ve been saying and I don’t 
like it.” 

“What do you mean you 
don’t like it?” Carson demand- 
ed. He added, “Sir?” 

“I figure you mean to put 
me back like I used to be.” 

“Yes, doctor,” Mitchell said 
eagerly, “just as you used to 
be.” 

“With my headaches, like 
before?” 

Mitchell coughed into his 
fist for an instant, to give him 
time to frame an answer. “Un- 
fortunately, yes. Apparently 
if yoqr mind functions proper- 

58 



ly once again you will have 
the headaches again. Our re- 
search is a dismal failure.” 

“I wouldn’t go that far,” 
Ferris remarked cheerfully. 

Mitchell was about to ask 
his associate what he meant 
when he saw Macklin slowly 
shaking his head. 

“No, sir!” the mathematician 
said. “I shall not go back to 
my original state. I can re- 
member what it was like. Al- 
ways worrying, worrying, 
worrying.” 

“You mean wondering,” 
Mitchell said. 

Macklin nodded. “Troubled, 
anyway. Disturbed by every 
little thing. How high was up, 
which infinity was bigger 
than what infinity — say, what 
was an infinity anyway? All 
that sort of schoolboy things. 
It’s peaceful this way. My 
head doesn’t hurt. I’ve got a 
good-looking wife and all the 
money I need. I’ve got it made. 
Why worry?” 

Colonel Carson opened his 
mouth, then closed it. 

“That’s right, Colonel. 
There's no use in arguing with 
him,” Mitchell said. 

“It’s not his decision to 
make,” the colonel said. “He’s 
an idiot now.” 

“No, Colonel. As you said, 
he’s a moron. He seems an 
idiot compared to his former 
level of intelligence but he’s 
legally responsible. There are 
millions of morons running 
around loose in the United 
States. They can get married, 
own property, vote, even hold 

THE BIG HEADACHE 




office. Many of them do. You 
can't force him into being 
cured... At least, I don't 
think you can.” 

“No, I can’t. This is hardly 
a totalitarian state.” The colo- 
nel looked momentarily glum 
that it wasn't. 

Mitchell looked back at 
Macklin. “Where did his wife 
get to. Colonel? I don’t think 
that even previously he made 
too many personal decisions 
for himself. Perhaps she could 
influence him.” 

“Maybe,” the colonel said. 
“Let’s find her.” 

T HEY found Mrs. Macklin 
in the dining room, her 
face at the picture window an 
attractive silhouette. She 
turned as the men approached. 

“Mrs. Macklin,” the colonel 
began, “these gentlemen be- 
lieve they can cure your hus- 
band of his present condition.” 
“Really?” she said. “Did you 
speak to Elliot about that?” 
“Y-yes,” Colonel Carson 
said, “but he's not himself. He 
refused the treatment. He 
wants to remain in his state 6f 
lower intelligence.” 

She nodded. “If those are 
his wishes, I can’t go against 
them.” 

“But Mrs. Macklin!” Mitch- 
ell protested. “You will have 
to get a court order overruling 
your husband’s wishes.” 

She smoothed an eyebrow 
with the third finger of her 
right hand. “That was my 
original thought. But I’ve re- 
decided.” 



“Redecided !” Carson burst 
out almost hysterically. 

“Yes. I can’t go against El- 
liot’s wishes. It would be 
monstrous to put him back 
where he would suffer the hell 
of those headaches once again, 
where he never had a mo- 
ment’s peace from worry and 
pressure. He’s happy now. 
Like a child, but happy.” 

“Mrs. Macklin,” the Army 
man said levelly, “if you don’t 
help us restore your husband’s 
mind we will be forced to get 
a court order declaring him 
incompetent.” 

“But he is not! Legally, I 
mean,” the woman stormed. 

“Maybe not. It’s a border- 
line case. But I think any 
court would give us the edge 
where restoring the mind of. 
Elliot Macklin was concerned. 
Once he’s certified incompe- 
tent, authorities can rule 
whether Mitchell and Ferris’ 
antitoxin treatment is the best 
method of restoring Dr. Mack- 
lin to sanity.” 

“I doubt very much if the 
court would rule in that man- 
ner,” she said. 

The colonel looked smug. 
“Why not?” 

“Because, Colonel, the mat- 
ter of my husband’s health, 
his very life, is involved.” 

“There is some degree of 
risk in shock treatments, too. 
But—” 

“It isn’t quite the same, 
Colonel. Elliot Macklin has a 
history of vascular spasm, a 
mild pseudostroke some years 
ago. Now you want to give 

59

THE BIG HEADACHE 




those cerebral arteries back 
the ability to constrict. To 
paralyze. To kill. No court 
would give you that authori- 
ty” 

“I suppose there’s some 
chance of that. But without 
the treatment there is no 
chance of your husband re- 
gaining his right senses, Mrs. 
Macklin,” Mitchell interject- 
ed. 

Her mouth grew petulant. “I 
don’t care. I would rather 
have a live husband than a 
dead genius. I can take care of 
him this way, make him com- 
fortable. .. ” 

Carson opened his mouth 
and closed his fist, then re- 
laxed. Mitchell led him back 
into the hall. 

“I’m no psychiatrist,” 
Mitchell said, “but I think 
she wants Macklin stupid. 
Prefers it that way. She’s al- 
ways dominated his personal 
life, and now she can dominate 
him completely.” 

“What is she? A monster?” 
the Army officer muttered. 

“No,” Mitchell said. “She’s 
an intelligent woman uncon- 
sciously jealous of her hus- 
band’s genius.” 

“Maybe,” Carson said. “I 
don’t know. I don’t know what 
the hell to tell the Pentagon. 
I think I’ll go out and get 
drunk.” 

“I’ll go with you,” Ferris 
said. 

Mitchell glanced sharply at 
the little biologist. 

Carson squinted. “Any par- 
ticular reason, doctor?” 

>y Jim Harmon 



“To celebrate/’ Ferris said. 
The colonel shrugged. 
“That’s as good a reason as 
any.” 

On the street, Mitchell 
watched the two men go off 
together in bewilderment. 

IV 

M acklin was playing 

jacks. 

He didn’t have a head on 
his shoulders and he was 
squatting on a great curving 
surface that was Spacetime, 
and his jacks were Earth and 
Pluto and the rest of the 
planets. And for a ball he was 
using a head. Not his head. 
Mitchell’s. Both heads were 
initialed “M” so it was all the 
same. 

Mitchell forced himself to 
awaken, with some initial dif- 
ficulty. 

He lay there, blinking the 
sleep out of his eyes, listening 
to his heart race, and then 
convulsively snatched the 
telephone receiver from the 
nightstand. He stabbed out a 
number with a vicious index 
finger. 

After a time there came a 
dull click and a sleepy answer. 

“Hello?” Elliot Macklin 
said. 

Mitchell smiled to himself. 
He was in luck; Macklin had 
answered the phone instead of 
his wife. 

“Can you speak freely, doc- 
tor?” Mitchell asked. 

“Of course,” the mathemati- 
cian said. “I can talk fine.” 



€1 




“I mean, are you alone ?” 

“Oh, you want to know if 
my wife is around. No, she’s 
asleep. That Army doctor, 
Colonel Sidney, he gave her a 
sedative. I wouldn’t let him 
give me anything, though.” 

“Good boy,” the biologist 
said. “Listen, doctor — Elliot — 
El, old son. I’m not against 
you like all the others. I don’t 
want to make you go back to 
all that worrying and thinking 
and headaches. You believe 
me, don’t you?” 

There was a slight hesita- 
tion. 

“Sure/* Macklin said, “if 
you say so. Why shouldn’t I 
believe you?” 

“But there was a hesitation 
there, El. You worried for just 
a second if I could have some 
reason for not telling you the 
truth.” 

“I suppose so,” Macklin said 
humbly. 

“You’ve found yourself wor- 
rying — thinking — about a lot 
of other problems since we 
left you, haven’t you? Maybe 
not the same kind of scientific 
problem. But more personal 
ones, ones you didn’t used to 
have time to think about.” 

“If you say so.” 

“Now, you know it’s so. But 
how would you like to get rid 
of those worries just as you 
got rid of the others?” Mitch- 
ell asked. 

“I guess I’d like that,” the 
mathematician replied. 

“Then come on over to my 
laboratory. You remember 
where it’s at, don’t you?” 

*2 



“No, I — yes, I guess I do. 
But how do I know you won’t 
try to put me back where I 
was instead of helping me 
more?” 

“I couldn’t do that against 
your wishes. That would be 
illegal !” 

“If you say so. But I don't 
guess I can come anyway. The 
Army is watching me pretty 
close.” 

“That’s alright,” Mitchell 
said quickly. “You can bring 
along Colonel Carson.” 

“But he won’t like you fix- 
ing me up more.” 

^But he can’t stop me! Not 
if you want me to do it. Now 
listen to me — I want you to 
come right on over here, El.” 
“If you say so,” Macklin 
said uncertainly. 

M itchell opened the 

door on the first knock. 
Macklin stood in the door- 
way, looking uncertain and ill 
at ease. Carson stood behind 
his left shoulder, looking ac- 
tively belligerent. 

“Come in,” Mitchell said. “I 
have the injection ready for 
you. Doctor.” 

“Now you aren’t going to 
‘cure’ me?” Macklin said in 
concern. “This is just going 
to help ease my mind?” 

“Of course,” the biologist 
said soothingly. 

Colonel Carson lunged for- 
ward, mouth opening ominous- 

iy- 

Mitchell winked at him 
broadly. 

Carson stopped in confusion 

THE BIG HEADACHE 




and studied Mitchell’s face. 
He essayed a second wink. 
Carson relaxed. 

Mitchell picked up the hypo 
of colorless carrier fluid from 
the interestingly stained work 
table. “One thing first, Dr. 
Macklin. I’ll have to have your 
signed release for this treat- 
ment. It specifies that your 
intelligence will probably be 
affected in this effort to keep 
your head from troubling you. 
Carson can witness it.” 

“Sure,” Macklin said. “I 
guess that’s okay. If you say 
so.” 

The colonel grinned, his 
face hot and shiny. “I’m sure 
it will be fine, Doctor.” 

Macklin looked at the of- 
ficer with almost a trace of 
suspicion, then accepted the 
sheet of typescript and the 
ballpoint pen from Mitchell. 
Laboriously he affixed his sig- 
nature. 

Mitchell had the mathema- 
tician take a seat and pressed 
the needle directly into the 
neck area. 

“Ouch !” Macklin said. 

Mitchell stood back and ex- 
haled. 

“It should take effect short- 
ly,” the biologist said. ' 

“Good,” Carson said . 

The cylinders of the electric 
clock said 4:35:00 A.M. 

Macklin was playing with 
his hands and their shadows 
in front of his face. 

“How long will this stage 
last, Dr. Mitchell?” Colonel 
Carson said in concern. 

“Indefinitely. This is the 

>y Jim Harmon 



last stage. The circulatory sys- 
tem of his brain has been re- 
laxed to the point where he 
has about the I.Q. of a 
turnip.” 

Carson steeled himself. “So, 
doctor! You’re nothing but a 
dirty Lux!” 

“No, Colonel. I’ve never 
even seen Luxemburg. My 
reason for doing this to Dr. 
Macklin were entirely pa- 
triotic ... or, at least, sympa- 
thetic.” 

“Tell that to the hangman! 
I’ll see you tried for treason.” 

“Look at him, Colonel. He 
is certainly no longer legal- 
ly responsible. He has the 
strength of a grown man and 
the intellect of an amoeba. It 
would be impossible to keep 
him alive either under seda- 
tion or in a padded cell. Even 
if Mrs. Macklin still refuses 
her consent — and I don’t think 
she will when she sees him 
in this bad a state — you can 
go over her head and get per- 
mission for Ferris and myself 
to administer our antitoxin to 
destroy the pituitrin-absorb- 
ing virus colony in his cere- 
brum.” 

Carson looked dazed. “I — 
I’ll call her.” 

M ITCHELL greeted the 
orangish sunrise with, a 
feeling of defeat. He turned 
from the window to face the 
instruments of his laboratory. 

Mrs. Macklin had come. 
Numbly she signed the release 
allowing the restorative treat- 
ment. By the time she, Car- 

63 




son and the mathematician 
left, Macklin had been able 
to say “mama” and — embar- 
rassingly — “p a p a” to him. 
Mitchell was confident he 
would regain his full senses 
and that the brain cells had 
only become passive, and had 
not decayed. 

But still it was only the 
wiping out of one horrendous 
mistake. Months and months 
of work wasted. 

The door banged open and 
a small man entered with a 
long, slender brown paper bag 
and proceeding on an aero- 
nautical search pattern. 

“Dr. Ferris!” Mitchell said. 
“You mustn't take it so hard. 
I tried to get in touch with 
you. But at least I have been 
able to administer the anti- 
toxin to Dr. Macklin.” 

“Who gives a damn about 
that egghead?” Ferris said, 
placing the paperbag upright 
on the work table. “Don’t you 
understand, man? We’re rich! 
Where are the glasses?” 
“Rich?” Mitchell said. “Doc- 
tor, would you like me to help 
you over to your own quar- 
ters?” 

“Relax, Mitchell. I’m not 
that drunk. I know what I’m 
talking about. I tell you the 
F-M Virus is going to make 
us rich! Powerful! Men like 
Elliot Macklin will be insig- 
nificant beside us.” 

He knew that Ferris was in 
sober earnest. “What do you 
mean, Doctor?” 

Ferris turned, his thin face 
lit up with a flush of pleas- 

64 



ure. “Mitchell, we have some- 
thing to make people perma- 
nently stupid ! People can 
stop thinking temporarily by 
using alcohol or narcotics or 
watching television. But we — 
only you and I — have some- 
thing to let them stop think- 
ing permanently. And we’ll 
make them pay for it — for the 
shot and the rent on the con- 
dition. Who wants to think? 
A handful of people. Who has 
to think to do routine paper- 
work or push a button or pull 
a lever? A bunch of happy, 
content morons can do all of 
that. We ll return man to his 
natural, pre-evolutionary state 
of stupidity. As for those of 
us who don't take the treat- 
ment, we have it made! 
Made !” 

Mitchell stared at him. 

“Don’t you get it, Mitch- 
ell?” Ferris roared. “We have 
the ultimate tranquilizer /” 

Mitchell thought of the 
world after the F-M Virus had 
been given it. He thought: In 
his condition, if I shoved Fer- 
ris so that his head cracked 
into the corner of the table, 
no one could prove anything. 
I could destroy our records. 

No, it wasn’t any good. 
Some other researcher some- 
where else was bound to iso- 
late the F-M Virus. None of 
it was any good. 

He groped blindly towards 
the door. He had to get out, 
get to a drugstore, buy some 
aspirins. 

His head was killing him.

The computer’s answers were 
remarkable — especially when 
nobody had asked a question! 

TRANSIENT 

BY WILLIAM HARRIS 



“M OON in 140 Pisces ” 

said the little perforat- 
ed card. Henderson stepped 
back from the computer and 
scratched his hairy head. Non- 
sense again. He threw the 
card in the wastebasket and 
repeated his directions on an- 
other : 

"One hundred fifty cancer 
susceptible mice were inject- 
ed in the pectoral region with 
1/cc of aromatic compound A. 
One hundred fifty identical 
control mice were injected 
with isotonic saline, B. Eight 
in group A developed sarco- 
mas at the point of injection, 
Group B developed none. Test 
the null hypothesis at 5% 
level of statistical signifi-. 
cance.” 

The computer accepted 



Henderson's second offering, 
chewed it into acceptable 
code, swallowed it, and 
burped. Henderson watched 
suspiciously as red and green 
blinkers went on and off and a 
contented humming noise 
came from the machine’s bow- 
els. After a while the card 
emerged from another opening 
— which orifice had been 
thoughtfully placed at the ap- 
propriate end of the machine, 
anatomically speaking; thus 
establishing rapport between 
Henderson, a biologist, and 
nature’s final product of evo- 
lution, the machine. 

Henderson looked at the 
card : "Today you should seek 
solace with close friends. Give 
some thought to personal fi- 
nances. Evening: get out and 



65 





see people. A stranger will 
bring news/' 

ENDERSON crumpled 
the card and tossed it in 
the wastebasket. He sat down, 
and with a. little arithmetic 
and some formulas tested the 
null hypothesis all by himself. 
He found that his mouse ex- 
periment carried no signifi- 
cance whatever. Then he made 
a notation that someone would 
have to come out in the morn- 
ing for his sick machine. 

In the morning when the 
machine's doctor, came to in- 
spect it, and percuss it, and 
auscult it, and give it a barium 
enema, it behaved very well. 
The “doctor” left, assuring 
Henderson the machine mere- 
ly had the hiccups. That night 
Henderson asked it a question 
about confidence limits for a 
universe mean, from a mean 
of a sample of n observations 
and got back, “Uranus on 
Antares but conjoining Ju- 
piter and trining the As- 
cendent. Yours is a strongly 
literary nature.” 

Henderson decided to turn 
the machine off for a few 
days. It emitted an almost hu- 
man sigh as it ran down and 
came to a halt. 

He had no immediate use 
for it as he would be inject- 
ing mice with carcinogens in 
liver, spleen, marrow and kid- 
neys to find out if they were 
specific. In three or four days 
whatever virus was affecting 
the machine's cerebral cortex 
should have run its course and 



the methodical Henderson 
could run his methodical ob- 
servations into the machine, 
which would excrete a good 
methodical answer to be duly 
filed in the medical school 
library, where it would be in- 
visible to anyone looking for 
it, such as freshmen medical 
students, and always in the 
way for anybody else. 

Henderson surveyed his 
laboratory with infinite pleas- 
ure, knowing that it contained 
within its confines all that 
could be known about the uni- 
verse, about men and about 
mice. Event Y followed event 
X in a purely causal manner. 
The successful investigator 
needed only to attach himself 
to the cycle and ride along, 
afterwards consulting the 
computer to find out if what 
he'd observed had any signifi- 
cance. 

In the morning when Hen- 
derson entered the laboratory 
he found that someone had 
left the computer on over- 
night. 

It was running full blast, 
which is to say the lights were 
blinking and the little cards of 
omniscience were popping out 
of the machine like toast and 
falling into the wastebasket, 
which is just where Hender- 
son left them. Meanwhile, Dr. 
Henderson's close associate, 
Colonel Smith in the nearby 
radiation laboratory, came in 
to visit him and asked per- 
mission to use the computer. 

And so in another week it 
was rumored about that the 




66 



TRANSIENT 




machine in Henderson's labo- 
ratory was using a foreign dia- 
lect and answering questions 
about standard deviation with 
strange symbols which looked 
like crescent moons and ar- 
chaic squiggles, with a little 
geometry on the side. 

The machine was becoming 
impudent too. To Colonel 
Smith’s question about the 
possibility of an “overkill” if 
such and such size bomb 
dropped on such and such ene- 
my city the answer came back, 
“Rubbish. Aldebaran conjoin- 
ing Saturn, Moon and Mars. 
Seek guidance from others, 
Hannibal blushed.” The ma- 
chine's doctor promptly in- 
stalled a loudspeaker to help 
keep track of future aberra- 
tions. 

T HAT night the janitor 
walked in. He was a bald- 
ing Greek gentleman, dedicat- 
ed to a life with brush and 
dustpan. The machine was 
muttering darkly to itself, but 
when he entered the door it 
quieted down, contemplating 
its relays. 

The janitor went meticu- 
lously about his business, mop- 
ping the floor, straightening 
chairs and secretly rearrang- 
ing pipette and retorts in their 
racks, because he was a more 
meticulous person than even 
Dr. Henderson. As he turned 
to leave, the machine in the 
corner belched twice and then 
said as an afterthought : 

“I am the ghost of Astrolo- 
gers Sagittarian.” 



The janitor adjusted his 
hearing aid, squeezed his mop 
and carried his pail out the 
door. As he went back in to 
pack up his cleaning powder 
and brushes, the machine said, 
“What year is this? Limits 
within standard deviation, 
click, click, awrk !” 

The janitor was a reasonable 
man. He walked over to the 
machine’s microphone and 
told it what year it was as 
well as the month, day and 
hour. Then he carried his 
brushes and cleaning com- 
pound out of the room and 
locked the door. 

But the janitor’s night was 
a long one. At midnight, when 
he finished two floors and 
only had three more to go, he 
took his coffee break. As he 
talked with his old friend 
Samuel, the night watchman, 
he fell to thinking. That was 
an unforgivable mistake. Af- 
ter the coffee break, they both 
went back up to Dr. Hender- 
son’s laboratory and listened 
to the machine talking to it- 
self. 

“I feel like a spider,” said 
the machine. “Nonsense. From 
one cobweb to another. Must 
settle down and build a grau 
. spltvbk. .within 95% con- 
fidence limits. Nova in An- 
dromeda was bad enough. Now 
this. One hundred fifty cancer 
susceptible mice inherit the 
Earth.” 

Suddenly the machine fell 
silent, sensing it had visitors. 
The night watchman reached 
into the wastebasket and 



■^i uiiii- ■ - ii. » 




pulled out one of the ma- 
chine’s cards. 

“Aldebaran is martial in na- 
ture, in the ninth degree of 
Tropical Gemini/’ it said. 

{{T’M a Gemifti!” exclaimed 

A the janitor, surprised to 
see anything familiar come out 
of the machine. “Birthday is 
May 25.’’ 

“Wonderful!” cried the ma- 
chine. “First intelligent man 
I’ve heard so far. Gemini is 
justly famed as the owner of 
a quick mind and ready wit. 
Your intellectual achieve- 
ments are a splendid asset to 
your literary inclinations.” 

The janitor', embarrassed at 
the sudden praise, shifted his 
broom from one hand to the 
other. The machine continued. 

“I need an Ephemeris,” said 
the machine. “Can you find 
aa Ephemeris? I need one 
desperately !” and the ma- 
chine’s desperate need for an 
Ephemeris so shook its intes- 
tines, liver and gallbladder 
that its tone of voice came out 
a minor third above the nor- 
mal monotonous dirge of the 
loudspeaker. 

“An E-what-eris?” said the 
janitor. 

“An Ephemeris,” repeated 
the machine. “An astronomical 
almanac. Something that tells 
me where Mars is. There I 
was, On my way over from the 
cloudk of Magellan to visit 
friends in Orion when Wham- 
mo! Mars comes into conjunc- 
tion with Uranus. When some- 
thing that big happens I jttst 



sit down and wait. Here I art 
now in this absurd device. Do 
you suppose you could look 
out the window and tell me 
where Mars is?” 

The night watchman said, 
“It’s cloudy outside.” 

“See!” said the machine, 
“When Mars goes on the war- 
path nothing comes out right. 
Now, Gemini, if you will just 
go down to the library and get 
me an Ephemeris for this year 
we can clear this up and I’ll 
be on my way, indebted to you 
for life, if not longer.” 

“Who shall I say it’s for?” 
asked the janitor, who did not 
fully understand that the li- 
brary was public, never having 
been in it before, and felt he 
needed a recommendation or 
a slip of approval. 

“Just say it’s for Pyet, the 
astrologer,” said the machine. 

“And what are you doing 
inside Dr. Henderson’s ma- 
chine ?” asked the night 
watchman. 

“I wouldn’t care to be quot- 
ed on this,” replied the ma- 
chine, “but actually any sys- 
tem of communicating inter- 
related events with a high de- 
gree of complexity, such as 
the brain, or this machine, and 
with some number of critical 
processes at the quantum sta- 
tistical level, can support con- 
sciousness.” 

The janitor and the night 
watchman looked blankly at 
each other and the machine, 
slightly embarrassed, added’ 
by way of explanation. 1 ‘ 

“I like to read a little 




physics now and then. A harm- 
less . superstition containing 
many pleasant diversions. 

“Before this I lived in a 
star, a puff of expanding gas. 
Before that in a haunted house 
...dreadful. And before that 
in the lopsided blob of proto- 
plasm that was the last of 
Pyet, the astrologer. 

“As for Dr. Henderson’s 
mousecatcher,” chuckled the 
machine, “any port in a storm. 
Mars and Uranus you know.” 

The janitor was somewhat 
impatient with the machine. 
It had detained him already 
and probably would soon be 
giving him orders. 

“I still have three floors to 
clean,” said the janitor. “After 
that I will see if the library 
downstairs has a. .what was 
it?” 

“Ephemeris,” said the ma- 
chine. “E-P-H-E-M-E-R-I-S. 
Thank you.” 

A ND so the night watchman 
and the janitor both said 
good night to the machine. 
Later, in the very early morn- 
ing, the janitor stole back into 
the laboratory with a book and 
read some strange, strange 
things out loud and then stole 
out of the room again and 
locked the door behind him. 
Shortly after, Samuel, the 
night watchman, passed by. 

He was surprised at an un- 
earthly glow coming from 
within and a peculiar grating 
noise as if someone were step- 
ping on a radio. Then the un- 
earthly glow appeared on the 



fire escape and Samuel, rush- 
ing out to observe, thought the 
glow seemed to fly up through 
a hole in the low clouds where 
a thousand stars still blazed 
brightly. In its wake there was 
a sound like laughing. 

A few hours later Dr. Hen- 
derson unlocked the door of 
his laboratory and pushed a 
cart full of mice in before him. 

During the morning he dis- 
sected three hundred mice, 
popping out liver, spleen and 
kidneys as if he were shelling 
peas. In the afternoon he made 
sections of the organs, stained 
them with hematoxylin and 
eosin, mounted them on slides 
and looked at them under his 
new stereoscopic microscope. 
Five minutes before five, Dr. 
Henderson’s friend, Colonel 
Smith, came in and watched as 
Henderson somewhat dubious- 
ly fed the three hundred mice, 
now in statistical form, into 
the machine. The machine 
whirred efficiently and shot 
out the answer in seconds. 

“Statistically significant,” 
said the machine. 

Henderson followed his 
friend Colonel Smith out the 
door, looking neither right not 
left, and locked it behind him. 
It had been a good day. 

Behind, in the laboratory 
which contained within its 
confines all that could be 
known about the universe, 
about man, and about mice, the 
machine squatted in silence, 
the approaching darkness al- 
ready enfolding it like a 
shroud. END

ONCE AROUND 
ARCTURUS 



BY JOSEPH GREEN 

Illustrated by Gaughan 



I 

N IKI stopped at the bank 
of the small stream and 
knelt to drink from the clear 
water. After the first few 
swallows she turned to look 
back, ready to flee if he 
should make one of the lion- 
like fast charges he had twice 
tried earlier in the chase. In- 
stead he stopped and waited, 
letting her drink at leisure. 

When she finished she rose 
to her feet, walked through 
the stream and resumed trot- 
ting on the other side. 

“Before nightfall, my pret- 
ty one !” he called after her, 
and knelt to drink the cold re- 
freshing water himself. When 
he lifted his head she was a 
hundred yards away and it 
was time to resume the chase. 

Michael Robert Combs was 
tired in every bone and mus- 
cle. It seemed that he had run 
for years through the cool air 
on the mountain slopes, al- 
ways a few yards behind the 
girl's lightly dancing feet. 
This odd affair had started 
yesterday morning at sunup, 
at her parent's house in the 
lowlands, and they had trot- 



ted without resting for over 
thirty hours. 

When the shadows began to 
lengthen it was time to live 
up to his boast or admit de- 
feat. Slowly, forcing his dead 
muscles by the sheer power of 
will, he stepped up the pace, 
extending himself second by 
agonizing second until he had 
changed from a trot to a slow 
run and gradually on into a 
racer’s long-stepping stride. 
Ahead of him, without visible 
additional effort, the girl 
matched his pace until they 
were running, still the same 
distance apart, through the 
deepening shadows. 

He had not drawn a full 
breath into his laboring lungs 
in an eternity. His legs were 
dead sticks hanging by slack 
tendons from lifeless hips, 
and his feet were mushy pil- 
lows that no longer felt the 
ground they trod. His stonv 
ach had shriveled and pulled 
tight against his ribs. He was 
near complete collapse and 
knew it. But he also knew 
that before he stopped he 
would die running, die be- 
tween one step and the next, 
because he was the most stub- 



70 




IF • Novelette 



He had given himself one 
Arcturan year — but the 
aliens allowed him less! 



born man Earth had ever 
flung into space and defeat 
was unthinkable. 

T HE end came with dra- 
matic suddenness. The 
girl stumbled and fell. 

She had tripped before and 
gotten up and fled again, but 
this time her strength failed 
her. While he covered the 
hundred yards between them 
she collapsed. 

She lay there breathing in 
great panting sobs, shoulders 
shaking, head jerking, body 
spasmodically twitching, leg 
muscles pulling and relaxing 
in an automatic effort to pro- 
pel her one more step. 

He reached her and 
stopped, stood there savoring 
the delicious knowledge that 
he could fall by her side and 
breathe, stretch out, relax and 
sleep. After a moment the 
spasms shaking the girl 
abated and her breathing 
eased. She passed immediate- 
ly into deep slumber. 

He knelt, turned her head 
gently in his hands, kissed 
the relaxed lips and collapsed 
by her side. 

ONCE AROUND ARCTURUS 



He paused in that timeless 
land lying just back of con- 
sciousness, unable to believe 
his senses. They were saying 
that the air was fresh, cool, 
that bright, deep yellow sun- 
light beat on his closed lids, 
that he was lying in heavy 
grass, wet and cold and that 
he had not been this hungry 
since his starvation-racked 
childhood. The sense of un- 
reality faded as memory re.- 
turned and he knew he was 
not in his strap in the ship. 

The world around him was 
real. 

Someone shook his shoulder 
vigorously and he opened his 
eyes. Niki was kneeling be- 
side him, a cluster of shiny 
black fruit in her hand. 

“Eat these very slowly, 
Mike. Let your stomach 
stretch gradually/' 

He was so stiff and sore it 
was painful to move, but his 
stomach clamored imperiously 
for attention. And the fruit 
was good. The reddish yellow 
sun of Arcturus was rising 
swiftly now, bringing a 
warmth to his chilled bones 
and outlining the vista before 

It 





him. The planet of Kee’Na 
had no honest mountains, but 
these hills approached a mile 
in elevation and they were 
near the crest. Below them, 
mile after mile of rolling, 
grassy country merged imper- 
ceptibly into the haze of dis- 
tance, the whole dotted with 
the farmhouses and accom- 
panying small buildings that 
were the homes of the Loyios. 
The farms were small, but the 
entire world, as he had seen it 
from a ship in the upper 
stratosphere, was roughly the 
same. The only larger build- 
ings were the small factories 
scattered over the entire plan- 
et and the regular pattern of 
composite-function structures 
called centers. 

“W’hy didn’t you run away 
when you woke first, Niki? If 
you’d hidden I might never 
have found you, and the rules 
say I must return you to your 
father’s house.” 

“True, Mike. But I am tired 
of running. You caught me 
fairly, and I will concede the 
first event and return with 
you willingly.” 

“Good. I was afraid I’d have 
to carry you.” 

Niki smiled wanly, but her 
understanding of Earth hu- 
mor was too limited to be cer- 
tain of his meaning. She was 
at least five nine in height and 
weighed close to a hundred 
and forty pounds. The tight- 
fitting one-piece suit she 
wore left her arms and legs 



bare, and they were beauti- 
fully shaped, well-muscled 
limbs. 

H ER face was beautiful. No 
other word could de- 
scribe it. The nose was thin, 
the nostrils strong but deli- 
cately carved. The cheekbones 
were prominent and high, the 
sides of her face smooth and 
almost flat. 

Her skin was a light bronze, 
her hair, hanging to her shoul- 
ders, a deep rich black. On 
Earth she would have passed 
for a professional athlete with 
a heavy tan, and could have 
blended in with ease. 

The man who threatened to 
carry her was five-eleven and 
weighed a hundred and seven- 
ty. He was thirty-five years 
old, gray around the temples, 
and considerably less of an 
athlete than he had been ten 
years ago in the Academy. 
Still, he was required by reg- 
ulation to keep himself fit. 

They found a rock-bed 
stream of clear water and 
washed down the fruit, then 
set out for the nearest visible 
farmhouse several miles away. 
As the exercise eased the 
stiffness in his joints Mike 
found himself stealing 
glances at the tall girl walk- 
ing with long, free strides by 
his side. He actually knew al- 
most nothing about her, other 
than the obvious facts that 
she was beautiful, desirable, 
and aloof. 

“How many more years do 
fey Jooopfc Groan 



72 




you expect to spend in train- 
ing, Niki?” he asked, hoping 
she would lose that cool re- 
serve in conversation. 

“Your years, about three. 
Our time of learning never 
actually ends, though, for as 
soon as I become a doctor I 
will take a pupil myself, and 
the process of teaching is self- 
educational.” 

“Every highly skilled per- 
son has a pupil rather than 
the pupils attending training 
meetings in groups?” He 
chose his words carefully, not 
certain of the extent of her 
English vocabulary. 

“Your Earthly concept of 
mass schools is unknown here. 
As children we study in the 
home under the direction of 
our parents. When we are 
ready we are given adulting 
tests, and if we pass, become 
adults and eligible for higher 
training. There are always as 
many skilled persons as pupils 
so we have difficulty entering 
the fields we choose.” 

“How many Loyios are 
there?” 

“About two hundred mil- 
lion* We have kept our popu- 
lation stable for many years.” 

There was a gentle hum- 
ming sound and a large, rec- 
tangular box came out of the 
sun toward them, settling gen- 
tly to the ground a few feet 
away. It was one of the elec- 
tric flying carriers of the 
Loyios, a wingless, wheelless 
box that successfully defied 
'gravity. Mike knew that the 

ONCE AROUND, ARCTURUS 



Loyios had succeeded in tap- 
ping their planet's magnetic 
field for electric power, prov- 
ing their technology ahead of 
Earth's in that one respect, 
and apparently they used an- 
other application of the same 
principle to nullify gravity. 
Their only other form of 
transportation was trained 
riding animals. 

The carrier door opened 
and Niki's younger brother 
Rober, a boy just approach- 
ing maturity, stepped out. He 
nodded to Mike with the 
gravity seemingly common to 
all his people and spoke to 
Niki in their own language. 

“Father sent us transporta- 
tion, Mike,” Niki translated, 
“He wants us to reach home 
in time to rest well for anoth- 
er contest tomorrow.” 

“We need it,” Mike said 
feelingly, and followed her 
on board. Rober had brought 
along hot food and he and 
Nike stuffed themselves as 
they flew homeward. When 
she could eat no more Niki 
curled up in her chair like a 
giant kitten and almost imme- 
diately fell asleep. It was a 
silent ride for the hour it took 
the slow craft to cover the 
miles they had ran and Mike 
found his mind returning to 
the time, four days before, 
when he had met her. 

II 

H E and several other ; of- 
ficers had been standing 
outside the ship a few min- 

73 




utes after the touchdown, 
stretching and breathing deep- 
ly of the fresh clean air of 
Arcturus Four. The landing 
field was a half-mile from the 
ethnologists’ station and the 
colonel and the two institute 
men who were inspecting it 
had walked over. Several 
crewmen were performing 
routine maintenance tasks on 
the hull and the rest were 
just watching and enjoying 
9/10’s G while they tried to 
absorb enough fresh air to 
last the next four months. A 
regular run lasted two years 
and they touched down only 
six times. 

Someone mounted on a 
four-legged beast left the 
station and came swiftly to- 
ward them. As the two crea- 
tures neared the ship it be- 
came obvious the rider was 
a woman, and when she drew 
closer they saw that she was 
young, lovely, and scantily 
clad. 

The other officers stared 
with simple admiration com- 
mingled with the intense de- 
sire of men long without 
women. Mike Combs looked 
at her and felt a hard jarring 
shock, a wrenching, tearing 
sensation of absolute need 
that reached deep inside his 
guts and anchored itself per- 
manently. With a sense of 
wonder and surprise he rec- 
ognized the feeling. It had 
come once before, and was 
unmistakable in its intensity. 
He was looking at something 
he honestly wanted. 

74 



A hot street corner in the 
Canaveral slums , a broad 
window , the shimmer of 
stainless steel appliances , 
people shoving by on a busy 
Saturday morning , and a boy 
in ragged clothing standing 
rapt, taut , eyes glued to the 
gray -suited form in the 
white-and-blue poster. Under 
the rugged , handsome figure 
a caption read: BE A 

SPACE CADET! That was 
enough. The story was too 
well known to need elabo- 
ration. 

The small slum kid who 
was Mike Combs did not 
make a resolution , either si- 
lent or oral. It was unnec- 
essary . The desire had flood - 
ed through him , irresistible , 
deep and complete , and he 
had known he would be a 
spaceman. 

The girl rode her mount 
directly to the group and 
dismounted in one smooth 
flowing motion. “I have a mes- 
sage for Captain Combs,” she 
said pleasantly, speaking 
English with only a slight ac- 
cent. Her voice was deep and 
strong, yet at the same time 
intensely female. 

Mike stepped forward and 
took the extended paper. It 
was a requisition for medical 
supplies and was properly 
signed by the colonel. 

“If you’ll come with me, 
please?” he said, and led the 
way into the ship. The 
thought came as they stepped 
into the elevator that his fel* 



by Joseph Green 




low officers would give him 
hell about not sending a crew- 
man on such a menial errand, 
but it would be envy speak- 
ing. 

In the small dispensary he 
slowly gathered up the re- 
quired drugs. As he handed 
them to her he asked, “May I 
inquire your name?” 

“As near as it will trans- 
late, Niki.” 

He placed his hands on her 
shoulders, so calmly and nat- 
urally she had no reason to 
be alarmed, and said, “You 
and I will be married within 
a year, Niki.” Then he drew 
her unresisting form into his 
arms and kissed her. 

She was stone-still in his 
embrace, completely u n r e- 
sponsive, and only when he 
stepped back did he see the 
strong shock in her eyes. 

He held the door open for 
her and, dazedly, she preced- 
ed him into the elevator and 
they were swiftly conveyed 
to the ground. 

When the ship took off on 
the next leg of its long run 
Mike was not on board. 

I N becoming a deserter Mike 
Combs gave up the first 
thing he had ever really want- 
ed to undertake the pursuit 
of the second. 

Captain Combs was a se- 
cretive man. He spoke not at 
all of his thoughts and only 
seldom of his actions. After 
spending one night in the 
woods, however, he decided 
his chances of success would 



be better if based on more in- 
formation, and appeared next 
morning at the ethnologists' 
station. 

“Where in hell have you 
been? Why did you desert 
your ship?” snapped Dr. Car- 
nacki, the chubby doctor of 
humanoid sociology, when the 
spaceman stepped inside. 

Mike grinned easily. He 
had known the peppery, like- 
able scientist since the long 
trip out two years ago, and 
knew that he possessed a 
s c a 1 p e 1-sharp tongue. “I 
didn’t desert. I fell into a ra- 
vine and it took me this long 
to climb out. Upon finding 
my ship gone I reported to 
the senior Earth representa- 
tive on this planet.” 

“Your ship had commit- 
ments which made it impera- 
tive to leave last night. As an 
officer you knew of those 
commitments. Come come, 
what’s the real reason?” 

“The fact that I’m going to 
marry your messenger, Niki, 
and take her home with me.” 
The doctor sat down abrupt- 
ly and the anger left his face. 
It was replaced by a thought- 
ful frown. ‘‘What crazy idea 
is this? Where did you see 
her long enough to form such 
an attachment?” 

“I met her once. That was 
long enough.” 

“Sit down,” the doctor said 
abruptly. “I think you’d bet- 
ter tell me about it, and some- 
thing about yourself as well*” 
And between sips of hot cof- 
fee Mike found himself tell- 



ONCE AROUND ARCTURUS 



75 




in g the chubby scientist of 
what he had felt on seeing 
Niki, and of a past known 
only to himself. 

When he stopped the doc- 
tor leaned back, chuckling, 
and drank his cold coffee. 
“Mike,- -did you know you are 
a neurotic? You must, or you 
couldn’t dissemble so well. 
Apparently those Florida 
slums taught you two things, 
though, that some people nev- 
er learn. Not to want too much 
out of life, but fight like hell 
for what you do want.” 

“I lied, cheated and actual- 
ly stole to get into the Acad- 
emy. I finally made it by 
blackmailing a congressman 
who was keeping a woman in 
our neighborhood.” 

. “If the applications commit- 
tee had known about your two 
terms in juvenile rehabilita- 
tion the President couldn’t 
have gotten you in,” said Dr. 
Carnacki drily. “And now 
you’re giving all that up on 
the chance you can persuade 
this girl to marry you and 
leave her home for Earth.” 
“I’m thirty-five years old, 
Doc. I only had two more 
runs before being anchored to 
a desk job anyway. It’s com- 
pulsory for a spaceman to be a 
bachelor, but most guys my 
age are looking around for 
wives. I found mine.” 

“I doubt it. There’s not a 
chance in a million she’d 
have you.” 

“Let me worry about that. 
Now 'tell me how they marry.” 
“By choice, as all truly civ- 

76 



ilized persons must. Either 
sex may propose. The culture 
is monogamous, and is world- 
wide. Your problem may be 
solved simply by walking up 
to the girl and asking her to 
be your wife.” 

“But you don’t think so?” 
“Would an intelligent per- 
son marry a total stranger? 
They wed for life. Infidelity 
is so uncommon as to be al- 
most unheard of. They don’t 
lead a second mental life that 
is constantly preoccupied with 
sex. 

T HE object of their discus- 
sion entered the room at 
that moment. In her hand was 
a sheaf of papers. She looked 
mildly surprised at seeing 
Mike there, and slightly 
troubled. 

Mike rose, stood silently as 
she approached the table. He 
said, “Niki, I stayed behind 
when my friends left because 
I am in love with you. Will 
you marry me and come with 
me to my world?” 

The girl’s troubled look 
deepened. “On what grounds 
do you base your choice of me 
as a mate, Mr. Combs?” 

Mike hesitated, groping for 
words, then answered, “On the 
fact that the sight of you, for 
the second time in my life, 
aroused an, extremely strong 
emotional reaction in me.” 
“That is sufficient to pro- 
pose to an alien? For life?” 
“Yes. And to wed for life 
is my only desire.” 

“I think it best I discuss it 

' by Joseph Green 




further with my parents. 
Would you dine with us this 
evening?” 

“It would be my pleasure.” 

Dr. Carnacki rose as the 
girl left and began pacing the 
floor, obviously excited. 
“Mike, I’m going to help you 
with your insane project. 
Niki’s father, Jakow, is our 
official contact with the Lo- 
yios government, what little 
there is of it. These people 
work together very closely 
but apparently from mutual 
consent, not official decree. 
Centralized authority is very 
small, but from what I have 
gathered Jakow is about as 
high in administration as they 
get. If he’s inviting you for 
dinner he has something on 
his mind, and I’d like to know 
what. 

“You see, Mike, we’ve been 
somewhat in the position of 
the monkey studying the man 
here, since these people are 
our cultural superiors and we 
are social, not physical, 
scientists. We are, by and 
large, the most advanced 
known world in the physical 
sciences, but without enough 
knowledge of ourselves to get 
along with each other, much 
less the five intelligent races 
we’ve encountered.” 

“This is interesting, but 
what has it to do with your 
decision to help me?” 

“Simply this. These people 
have shown us token hospital- 
ity and been outwardly help- 
ful, but nevertheless have ac- 
tually given us damn little on 
ONCE AROUND ARCTURUS 



themselves. From what I do 
know and have guessed I pre- 
pare a report that set the In- 
stitute on its ear. Those two 
men were here to see for them- 
selves, and to check my sani- 
ty. The decision is that I'm 
still all here, and now Earth 
Central would like to know 
how they achieved such a sane 
society. I think the Loyios* 
answer to your efforts to mar- 
ry Niki may be very reveal- 
ing. The fact that the last 
head-count disclosed every 
tenth person on Earth to be 
neurotic lends this study con- 
siderable urgency.” 

Mike laughed and got to 
his feet. “It would be a dull 
world without a few nuts. Doc, 
and I have a hunch these Lo- 
yios don’t lead very exciting 
lives.” And he left for the 
kitchen to hunt a more sub- 
stantial breakfast. 

A T seven o’clock he 
knocked on the door of 
the house of Jakow. 

They ate immediately after 
his arrival, and thanks to a 
long briefing by Dr. Carnacki 
he managed the process of 
food consumption creditably. 
The chubby sociologist had 
also given him an intensive 
indoctrination into Loy io 
customs, manners, habits and 
history. He knew that they 
had no psychosomatic ill- 
nesses, that insanity, which 
was rare, was always physical- 
ly based, that the average 
lifespan had risen to nearly 
twice that of an Eartfiman, 

77 




and that in Carnacki’s opinion 
they were ahead of Earth in 
every important science. His 
home planet’s great technolog- 
ical achievements the social 
scientist dismissed with a con- 
temptuous shrug, until Mike 
reminded him he would not 
be here studying the Loyios 
were it not for that same 
technology. 

There were seven people at 
the dinner, the five members 
of Niki’s family and another 
guest besides himself, who 
was introduced as Doctor La- 
silia. Niki was serving her 
doctor’s training with him. 
All the adults except Niki’s 
mother spoke English intel- 
ligibly, but Jakow, who spoke 
almost as well as Niki, did 
most of the talking. The en- 
tire group treated their alien 
guest with heavy courtesy but 
no especial show of friendli- 
ness. 

Knowing that he was a 
seriously introverted, with- 
drawn man himself Mike felt, 
with grim humor, that he fit- 
ted in quite well. This was no 
worse than the month he had 
spent in Ethiopia during the 
summer recess of his sixth 
year at the Academy. He had 
accepted an invitation from 
his roommate of that year and 
spent the recess in his home. 
No one there spoke interna- 
tional English. He found 
sharing their work, their 
play, their primitive way 
of life a strange and disturb- 
ing experience. He lived some 
high moments on a wild-dog 

78 



hunt along the banks of the 
Blue Nile, and shot a spotted 
leopard out of a huge senecio 
tree, but he was glad when it 
was over and he could return 
to the Academy. 

Jakow was a huge man, six- 
ty-seven years old by Earth 
reckoning but younger in ap- 
pearance than Mike. His fa- 
cial expression seldom 
changed, and his voice, big 
and heavy as his body, was al- 
most a monotone as he sought 
carefully for English words. 
It was a subdued meal and 
everyone seemed glad when it 
was over. 

The two girls stayed to do 
the kitchen chores while the 
adults adjourned to another 
room. Once they were seated 
Jakow got down to business. 

“Mike, Niki has informed us 
of your wish to combine with 
her and take her to your home. 
By our standards she is a lit- 
tle young for mating, but I 
understand such is not the 
case on your world. Niki has 
many friends of her own here, 
who would become suitors 
later, but for now she is emo- 
tionally free. Therefore her 
mother and I have decided 
that you should be given a 
chance to win her. Now, it is 
customary in our society for a 
suitor to be pitted against a 
member of the desired one’s 
family in contests of skill or 
intelligence, to determine his 
worthiness. Are you willing to 
take part in such tests?” 

“Of course, since that is 
your custom.” 

by Joseph Green 




“Our young couples normal- 
ly associate with each other 
for years before one asks the 
other’s family to hold the con- 
tests, but we are making an 
exception in your case,” the 
toneless voice went on. “We 
will arrange a series of such 
events for you. All adults in 
the family will vote on wheth- 
er to accept you after observ- 
ing you in the contests, and 
the vote will be made known 
to the girl. She alone, how- 
ever, is the final judge. Los- 
ing in these events does not 
necessarily disqualify you, 
since the girl may accept or 
reject on the basis of your 
actions rather than the out- 
come. Because this is an 
unusual contest, and physical- 
ly you are hardly a match for 
any male in this family, we 
have decided that your oppo- 
nent will be Niki herself. Re- 
turn in three days and the 
contests will begin.” 

Ill 

« A RE you ready for the 
second event, Mike?” 
Jakow asked after breakfast, 
the morning after their chase. 

“As ready as I'll ever be,” 
answered Mike. He did feel 
surprisingly good after rest- 
ing a day and night. 

“I am happy. The second 
event will try your mental 
ability. The third and final 
one, I will tell you now, will 
require a combination of 
strength and intelligence.” 

Mike shrugged his shoul- 

ONCE AROUND ARCTURUS 



ders uncaringly. Jakow gave 
orders to his family pertain- 
ing to the day's work, then 
asked the Earthman to help 
him saddle three mounts. The 
second test was to take place 
at the nearby center, under 
the direction of Dr. Lasilia. 

They saddled the three 
mounts in silence and led 
Niki’s into the yard. She came 
out of the house immediately, 
dressed in a tunic similar to 
the ones he had seen on her 
before but subtly different in 
wear and fit. She mounted her 
beast with graceful ease and 
Jakow led them toward the 
center. 

By Earth’s standards it was 
the most modern structure 
Mike had seen on Kee'Na , and 
the best equipped. These cen- 
ters were combination hospi- 
tal, library, laboratory and ex- 
change center for the goods 
produced in the factories. 
They were the only semi-com- 
mercial institutions on the 
planet. 

The majority of the instru- 
ments and tools he saw when 
they led him into what was 
obviously the hospital section 
were strange and alien, but 
competent appearing. Dr. La- 
silia was waiting for them 
there. 

“Hello Niki, Mike. Niki, you 
know what we do, you study 
with me. Mike, I put you two 
under little anesthesia. Use 
drug what frees mind. Mind 
more power, stronger. While 
you strong we make problems. 
Guide mind into them. All 

79 




answers recorded on machine, 
way I not explain your terms.” 
“It records thoughts, Mike, 
and makes them visible and 
audible,” said Niki. 

“Please take places,” said 
Dr. Lasilia. The table toward 
which he gestured was an odd 
affair, made like a double bed 
but with carved hollows and 
angled, immovable pillows. 
Mike climbed gingerly into 
one of the hollows and 
lay back, the pillow holding 
his head up at a forty-five de- 
gree angle. Niki climbed into 
the other side and stretched 
out her long length of beauti- 
ful femininity with a sigh. 

“Hold hands, please,” said 
Dr. Lasilia briskly, and Mike 
felt Niki’s warm hand creep 
into his own. He closed his 
fingers on it softly. A mo- 
ment later Dr. Lasilia passed 
a resilient band of some sort 
around their wrists, locking 
them together. 

Bands were placed around 
their foreheads, and counters 
of some sort over their hearts. 
Out of the corner of his eye 
Mike saw the doctor press 
some buttons on a control 
board and unseen machinery 
began to hum quietly. A mo- 
ment later the Doctor placed 
a mask of a peculiar softness 
over his mouth and nose. 
There was something in the 
mask that stank, terribly, but 
he breathed it without demur. 

A recorded voice that he 
recognized as Jakow’s be- 
gan speaking and he tried to 



listen, but a giant hand came 
out of nothingness and pulled 
him downward into nebular 
blackness, where he roamed, a 
lost soul, until a glint of light 
pierced the infinity and he 
rushed toward it, emerging on 
a low, rocky hill. He blinked 
and looked about. 

He was standing on a bluff, 
gazing out over a small green 
valley. The yellow sun of Arc- 
turus rode high overhead. At 
his feet, spread out over the 
valley floor, was an armed 
force. On the opposite side, in 
identical formation, stood an- 
other army. And he knew, ir- 
refutably, that Niki stood on 
the slopes above that army, 
and that she too had just 
awakened. 

The rules that would govern 
this strange conflict were al- 
ready imprinted on his mind. 
The two armies were of ex- 
actly the same size, to the 
man. They were composed 
solely of foot soldiers. The 
rules of combat were that two 
enemies canceled each other 
out and disappeared when 
they met. If two men of one 
force, however, attacked a sin- 
gle member of the other force 
the single man alone disap- 
peared. Any soldier who suc- 
ceeded in getting through the 
other army’s lines and attack- 
ing the commander canceled 
the commander and the fight 
was over. 

The soldiers were bound by 
the standards normally set for 
humans, with one exception. 
Every soldier on the field, 



Ku lA««nh 




fighters as well as officers, 
could hear every mental order 
of the commander, making 
maneuvering much faster. 

As he stared across the wide 
valley he saw that the opposite 
army was on the march. Niki 
was attacking him. 

He studied their formation 
a moment, then ordered his 
own army forward, compelling 
it to take the shape he desired 
as they marched. Niki was at- 
tacking in four columns eight 
men wide and forty men deep, 
with a thin but solid line at 
the rear, one which extended 
slightly on both sides of the 
marching soldiers. By her 
side she retained a personal 
guard of what looked to be 
about fifty men. 

He saw the weakness in her 
plan of combat immediately. 
As his men stepped out they 
organized into a gigantic 
wedge, one four men wide at 
the apex, six on the second 
row, eight on the third and so 
on until his line was over a 
hundred men wide. He aimed 
the wedge directly at the cen- 
ter of the army. 

She saw that his organiza- 
tion would bring more of his 
men in direct contact with 
hers, giving him more two-to- 
one encounters, and changed 
her battle plan. The four col- 
umns ground to a halt. The 
thin line at the rear began to 
thicken as more men joined 
it. The two ends of the line 
kept marching while the cen- 
ter stood still and absorbed 
more men, and in only minutes 



she had a fighting crescent 
into which his wedge would 
fit as neatly as a sword into 
its sheath. 

It would have been almost 
certain stalemate. He changed 
the line swiftly, one more 
time, and saw her matching 
move, and then the marching 
men collided, and began dis- 
appearing in tiny puffs of air. 

Around him, as his personal 
guard, he kept fifty-two men. 

T HE toy soldiers marched as 
directed and did their bit 
with ease and speed as the 
battle grew hotter, disappear- 
ing with a rapidity that swift- 
ly reduced the field. Mike 
worked hard and fast and 
to gain the maximum number 
of victories out of the wide- 
open melee, and when the 
field was clear he had suc- 
ceeded in his aim. The two 
final warriors stood facing 
each other on a clear field, 
hesitated, then attacked. They 
disappeared in the little puff 
of wind, and Mike would have 
sworn it was their sigh of re- 
lief. 

He ordered his bodyguard 
forward, and walked behind 
them toward the enemy. 

Her guard came out to meet 
them and. on a smaller scale, 
it was motion and counter-mo- 
tion, plan and counter-plan, 
until the bodies met. 

The smaller battle went 
swiftly. When it was over 
Mike knew that his guess had 
been good. She had reserved 
exactly fifty men for her 




bodyguard, her mind running 
in even numbers. He had fif- 
ty-two. In the wild meeting of 
the main battle he had gained 
two men on her. When the air 
cleared of the guard’s fight 
they had gone down man for 
man — and he still had two 
men standing. 

He sent the two guards after 
her, where she stood quietly 
waiting. 

“I concede this game, Mike/’ 
she called clearly, waved one 
arm at him, and disappeared. 

The scene blurred and shift- 
ed before his eyes, his two 
loyal phantoms became 
wraiths of smoke, vanished, 
and he was being sucked down 
again, into the familiar black- 
ness. .and came up into a bar- 
ren world. 

His instructions were clear 
and simple. He was a God. 
This was a new planet. In his 
hand was the seed of life. He 
was to build a world. 

And he began. 

Whatever he thought of, in 
detail, came instantly into be- 
ing. He placed topsoil, started 
vegetation growing, cleared 
land, started a weather cycle, a 
climate cycle, made rivers, 
built lakes, started the wild- 
life, created farms, put peo- 
ple on them, began animal 
husbandry, built cities, built a 
civilization. 

The uncertain element was 
the fact that everything, once 
created behaved in its natural 
fashion and was not under his 
control. The water ran down- 
hill, the trees grew, the peo- 



ple worked, made love and be- 
got, the animals ate the crops 
and each other, the lakes over- 
flowed the inadequate rivers 
and flooded the land, drown- 
ing the animals, and the hard- 
ier vegetation grew faster 
than its neighbors. Nothing 
that had been started could be 
destroyed. He had to create 
natural enemies to curb the 
hardy vegetation, dig deeper 
channels for the rivers, make 
what amendments he could by 
the creation of new elements. 

He had twenty-two hours, 
one Kee’Na day cycle. After 
that his work would be judged 
as would Niki’s. The better 
world determined the winner, 
and the doctor was the judge 
of what constituted a better 
world. 

The day fled by with re- 
markable speed. He became 
completely engrossed in being 
a creator, and when the time 
was up he looked down on his 
world and was unable to 
judge it. Some of it was good, 
and much was not. Many 
things were better than 
Eartkmen had ever seen them, 
and some were worse. His 
control of nature had not been 
perfect and he had killed 
thousands of people and ani- 
mals with natural catas- 
trophes produced by his 
blunders. 

He had a last brief glimpse 
of his efforts to play God. 

Then he was compelled 
forward into consciousness, 
and found he was lying on the 
table, his hands by his side.

instrument. 

“Lie, Mike. You in strain,” 
he said gently when Mike 
tried to rise. Miki lay quietly, 
breathing deeply. 

'"Take this, sleep” said the 
doetor, offering Mike a small 
pill. He took it and a glass of 
water, swallowed and lay back. 
He was completely exhausted. 
Tentatively he reached across 
the space between them and 
gxoped. His fingers touched 
Niki’s bare thigh. Seconds 
later' her hand came stealing 
back into his. 

When he awoke he was 
alone. Niki was gone, and it 
was approaching noon. They 
had passed a full day and 
night on the table. 

He straggled to his feet and 
stood swaying, dizzy, until his 
head cleared, then went in 
search of food. He was raven- 
ously hungry. 

He found the kitchen after 
a short search. The first thing 
fee saw on entering was Niki, 
seated next to a bar consuming 
a large sandwich. 

“Hello, Mike,” she greeted 
hijn between bites, and spoke 
to the cook in her own lan- 
guage. 

The cook, an elderly woman 
with a beautiful but lined face, 
brought him a sandwich con- 
sisting of unfamiliar ingre- 
dients but which tasted deli- 
cious. 

“Who won that last con- 
test, Niki?” he asked as soon 

a a ’ 



as the worst hunger pangs had 
subsided. 

“I did, Mike,* she said, smil- 
ing. “You created far more 
than I in the allotted time, 
more of everything from peo- 
ple to raindrops, but you made 
so many mistakes and your 
world was so poorly balanced 
that father and Dr. Lasilia 
judged me the winner. I've 
seen the final impression of 
your world, and you can see 
mine if you wish.” 

“I'll wait until the contests 
are over.” 

“That will not be long,” 
said a heavy, toneless voice, 
and Jakow was standing be- 
side them. “We will have the 
final test ready in a short 
time. Now please go into the 
library while Dr. Lasilia and 
I prepare it.” 

W HEN they entered the 
room Jakow closed the 
door on them with an admoni- 
tion not to come out until they 
were called. The area was de- 
serted, and since they were 
not allowed out it was highly 
unlikely anyone would be al- 
lowed in, at least for the mo- 
ment. Mike reached for Niki 
as soon as the door hid them 
from Jakow. 

She did not resist him, 
which was helpful, since she 
was almost as strong as he. 
But she kept her eyes open 
and stared calmly into his face 
as he drew her lips toward 
his. 

He stopped, arms around 
her shoulders, their bodies 
lightly touching and lips only 




inches apart. He held her so, 
wanting to complete the em- 
brace, wanting to ask her per- 
mission, wanting anything 
that would remove that cool 
superior look from her lovely 
features. His torment must 
have shown in his face, for 
suddenly her arms were 
around his neck, the long 
beautiful length of her nes- 
tled snugly against him and 
the full lips were warm and 
sweet under his own. 

It seemed a wonderfully 
long time before she let her 
arms slip down and pressed 
gently against his chest. 

She turned away to compose 
herself. “Let me show you 
some of our artwork, Mike,” 
she said after a moment, 
though she still did not look 
at him. He followed her into 
an alcove and she plucked a 
binder from the shelves and 
opened it. 

It was a series of color- 
prints, obviously copies of 
famous Kee’Na paintings. 
Each primary color, where it 
was used pure, glowed; the ef- 
fect of several glowing colors 
on a single painting was 
hauntingly beautiful, terribly 
different. Mike felt his mind 
reel as he tried to grasp their 
meaning. More than anything 
he had yet seen the little bind- 
er brought home, forcibly, the 
fact that the girl by his side 
was an alien. 

But she did not seem as 
strange as his Ethiopian 
friend, when she began trying 
to explain their conception of 

ONCE AROUND ARCTURUS 



art. He listened attentively, 
watching the movement of the 
rich lips until he could stand 
it no longer. This time she was 
not so reluctant, and after the 
fourth kiss he gently closed 
the book and put it aside. The 
work of art in his arms was 
the finest the Loyios could 
produce. They sat side by side, 
arms around each other, and 
between caresses they spoke 
in a language understood by 
lovers on any world. 

After a time Mike’s breath- 
ing eased and he collected 
himself enough to ask if he 
was honestly the first man in 
her life. 

“You are the first to want 
me, Mike, truly. I have friends 
my own age who have kissed 
me. but only in play.” 

“Did your father persuade 
you to hold the contests with 
me. or were you willing?” 
“He asked, yes, but I was 
already willing. You fright- 
ened me at first, but I wanted 
to see what you were like. 
Now I’m not afraid.” 

“Don’t be, ever.” 

“Mike, my people are not as 
emotional as yours. I know 
this not just from you but 
from Dr. Carnacki and the 
others. Do you really think 
you and I are compatible? 
Also, we probably couldn’t 
havre children.” 

“How do you know about 
children, until we try? And 
yes, I’m certain we re com- 
patible. I’ll devote the rest of 
my life to proving it.” 

He stopped her next words 

_ 85 



with a kiss, and the library 
faded into a dim background 
for both of them. Fortunately 
Jackow tapped discreetly on 
the door before he opened it. 

T HEY were composed 
enough as they followed 
the big man to a large room 
in the center of the hospital, 
where Dr. Lasilia was waiting. 

“Mike, there is a possibility 
you won't live through this 
test," said Jakow as they en- 
tered the room. “If you do not 
wish to place yourself in 
danger I suggest that you 
withdraw." 

Mike raised his eyebrows. 
"Wouldn't that disqualify 
me?" 

“Not necessarily. Remem- 
ber, our custom says a wom- 
an and her family judge by 
the character shown in the 
trials, not the results alone. 
Many women prefer the man 
do nothing dangerous, since 
they have already decided to 
accept and don’t want to see 
him injured." 

“Have you already made up 
your mind, Niki?" Mike asked. 

She looked slightly startled, 
and he realized he had made 
a social error. 

“I’d — already made a tenta- 
tive decision, Mike, but it isn’t 
definite." 

“Then I’ll play." 

Jakow nodded, and Dr. La- 
silia said, “Take off footwear, 
both." 

Mike did as instructed, then 
followed the doctor toward 
two strange objects partially 



hidden behind screens in the 
center of the room. They were 
enormous mollusks, with the 
upper shells propped open at 
a sharp angle. The things were 
so huge Mike could step into 
the open space between the 
upper and lower shells. They 
were placed back to back. 

“Your task, Mike and Niki, 
will be to stand in the mouth 
of these shellfish and hold the 
jaws open until the other per- 
son concedes," began Jakow. 
“Once you have assumed your 
position and we have removed 
the props the creatures’ mus- 
cles will exert a closing pres- 
sure of between two and three 
hundred pounds, which you 
will have to withstand. You 
may quit at any time simply 
by calling for help. The dan- 
ger lies in the fact that you 
may be too stubborn to call 
when you become exhausted 
and will let yourself be forced 
down. These jaws get progres- 
sively stronger as they draw 
closer together, and if they 
force you flat they will crush 
you to death. There is a solu- 
tion to the problem which does 
not depend on strength. You 
must find it during the first 
hour for it to be useful." 

The doctor motioned to 
Mike and he stepped into the 
mouth of the monster that 
would probably swallow him 
within the next few hours, 
bent his head and secured a 
solid grip with his shoulders 
on the upper shell. He braced 
his feet firmly, sliding them 
around until his footing was 



86 



by Joseph Green 




secure, then said, “Ready.” 

Dr. Lasilia placed a hand on 
the two wooden supports, 
Mike heaved strongly, the up- 
per shell rose slightly, and the 
doctor removed the props. The 
shell settled on Mike’s shoul- 
ders with a leaden and im- 
placable weight. 

V 

O UT of the corner of his 
eye he saw Dr. Lasilia 
lead Niki out of sight and 
heard her taking her stand in 
the other mollusk. If her foot 
slipped, or she lost her nerve 
and tried to jump... Already 
he was braced and straining 
like a bull simply to stand 
erect, and the mollusk would 
not tire. 

Dr. Lasilia came back into 
sight, picked up a book and 
settled himself comfortably in 
a chair. Jakow was leaving. 
“Mike, ' don’t be fool, be 
killed. Call, I get you out. No 
woman worth hurting, dying 
for, Niki positive not. You 
in comfort, Niki?” he raised 
his voice to ask. 

“Read your book and be 
quiet. Mike and I have a prob- 
lem to solve,” came the girl’s 
voice from out of his sight. 

The doctor chuckled and 
did as told. He only raised his 
head occasionally to glance 
calculatingly at both of them. 

Mike eased his load to the 
most comfortable position pos- 
sible and settled down to some 
hard thinking. He had two fac- 
tors to work on. One, there 



was definitely a solution 
which did not require that he 
stand here under this strain. 
Second, he must do whatever 
he had to do within an hour. 

It took about five minutes 
of mulling it over before the 
solution hit him, and it was 
so simple he felt himself a 
fool not to have seen it imme- 
diately. 

He turned until he was 
looking into the gaping maw 
of the brainless, thing that 
wanted to swallow him whole, 
moving slowly and carefully. 
Once he was facing the 
shadowy interior he put his 
palms against the shell above 
him, eased the weight from his 
shoulders to his hands and 
then slowly let his knees bend, 
straightening his arms as he 
went downward. When his 
arms were straight above his 
head he exerted his full 
strength and straightened his 
legs, forcing the shell upward 
over a foot. 

Once he had gained that 
initial first foot it was only 
a matter of grit and endurance 
to walk inward into the crea- 
ture’s body, his feet sinking 
through slimy pulp to the 
hard shell beneath. When the 
upper half was almost vertical 
he heard the slight sound of 
muscles tearing in the giant 
body and the pressure sudden- 
ly relaxed. 

He walked easily back to 
the outer edge, found the actu- 
al weight of the upper shell 
was less than fifty pounds, 
and prepared to stand there 



ONCE AROUND ARCTURUS 



87 




until Niki herself conceded. 

Niki walked around the cor- 
ner. 

For the first time he real- 
ized the doctor had not been 
in his chair for the past sev- 
eral minutes. Now he came 
into sight from behind Niki. 

“You come out, Mike. You 
solved problem. Niki first, so 
won contest. That all tests, 
both did fine.” 

J AKOW met them at his 
door. “Dr. Carnacki sent 
word he wanted to talk with 
you as soon as you were free 
to join him, Mike. If you will 
come for dinner again tomor- 
row we will have a decision 
ready. Who won the final 
event ?” 

Niki passed into the house 
with a polite smile of good-by. 

“She won it, hands down,” 
Mike admitted sheepishly. 
“Too smart for me.” 

“Not according to the sec- 
ond test, where you did very 
well,” Jakow returned polite- 
ly, and after a few more amen- 
ities Mike left for the sta- 
tion. 

Dr. Carnacki was sprawled 
at his ease, drinking home- 
made beer and reading a very 
thick book when Mike found 
him in his room an houj: later. 
It was just turning dark out- 
side, and as he relaxed into a 
chair Mike realized for the 
first time how tired he actual- 
ly was. 

The chubby scientist fin- 
ished his paragraph, then 
picked up a pad and started 

88 



shooting questions at Mike. 
He made brief notes for an- 
swers, and his questions 
ranged from their personal be- 
havior toward Mike to their 
apparent mastery of mental 
imagery, a science barely 
touched on Earth. He would 
have gone on all night if Mike 
had not pleaded fatigue. 

“All right, but we’ll have to 
start over in the morning. 
Mike, your falling in love was 
the best thing that ever hap- 
pened to this station. I’ve got- 
ten more data from you... 
Incidentally, I’ve done some 
checking on my authority as 
the Earth representative here. 
I think I swing enough weight 
to get you off if they charge 
you with desertion.” 

“Thank God !” the words 
popped out, to be instantly re- 
greted, and then slowly the 
regret went away and Mike 
Combs had taken another step 
out of his personal shell. 

“I’m glad to hear it, Doc. 
Even a desk job in the patrol 
is better than anything else 
on Earth.” 

For the first time since 
landing on Kee’Na he went to 
bed with a light heart. 

Next morning, after a late 
breakfast, he was closeted 
with Dr. Carnacki again, and 
this time managed to satisfy 
the sociologist’s voracious 
curiosity. After lunch the 
three other members, who

Doctor had missed anything

by Joseph Green 




though he had been through 
another courtship test. 

Before dark he had bathed, 
shaved and otherwise im- 
proved upon his looks as much 
as possible. He was ready for 
the decisive visit to the house 
of Jakow. 

Up till now he had not ad- 
mitted to himself the possibili- 
ty of failure. His goal was 
clear before him and he had 
been plunging headlong to- 
ward it, expending all the 
strength that was in him, as 
he had done once before in his 
life. The first quest had been 
crowned with success and he 
had lived aimlessly now for 
ten long years, awaiting a new 
trail. When it came, fate had 
prepared a good one. 

T HERE was one big objec- 
tion to the marriage which 
a man of more forethought 
might have let discourage 
him. When he was a feeble, 
infirm old man, providing he 
lived so long, Niki would be a 
beautiful young woman, just 
passing into early maturity. 
Her passions would be 
stronger, deeper, at a time 
when he was going downhill 
at an ever faster pace. What 
would such a maladjusted 
chronology do to a mar- 
riage? On Earth, where he 
expected to live, the answer 
was an old and familiar story. 

Still darker fancies ruled 
his mind as the miles passed, 
and he was not in an optimis- 
tic mood when he tapped on 
their front door. 



It opened immediately and 
Niki’s younger sister, a replica 
of the beautiful girl in all but 
size, led him to the dining 
room, where the family was 
just beginning to gather. 

Jakow permitted no talk of 
the contest at the dinner table. 
He kept the conversation on 
Earthmen, asking incisive 
questions about their customs, 
habits, social attitudes and 
scientific ability. His ques- 
tions were not disguised digs 
but open, frank inquiries. 

After about the first hun- 
dred queries Mike understood 
something he was a little late 
in grasping. It was not exact- 
ly an accident that the beauti- 
ful Niki had been chosen to 
work for the Earthmen at

their small station, or that 
Jakow was their official con- 
tact. The big man was an ad- 
vanced sociologist, probably 
the Kee’Na equivalent of 
Carnacki. The Loyios appar- 
ently trained their adminis- 
trators in the human sciences 
rather than politics. 

This business of Man study- 
ing Loyios was indeed a two- 
way proposition! 

When the meal was over 
Jakow asked the entire group 
to gather in what was, to 
earthly eyes, the family room. 
Niki’s mother, a woman whose 
beauty was of the quiet, un- 
obtrusive sort, sat by Jakow. 
Niki had disappeared. 

“Mike, in fairness to you I 
think you should know that 
Niki was requested, by myself 
and a group of other sociolo- 
gists, to hold these contests,” 
Jakow began abruptly. “I am 
sorry to tell you your — ah — 
let us call it intensity — some- 
what frightened her. Her first 
reaction to your forthright 
statement on the ship was to 
inform you she did not desire 
your courtship. Her second 
was to tell me about it. Which 
I am very glad she did. Our 
young people do not normally 
think of combining until after 
their education is complete, a 
matter of several more years 
in Niki’s case. But we asked 
her to consent to your court- 
ship for the purpose of study- 
ing an Earthman’s reactions 
under unusual stimuli.” 

He paused, and there was a 
faint cloud over his face when 
he continued. “You are a won- 
90 



derful and extraordinary race 
of humanoids, Mike, and we 
have never encountered an- 
other like you. According to 
all that is logical you should 
not have Won a single contest, 
yet it was our judgment that 
you beat Niki soundly in the 
overall game. There are cer- 
tain intangibles — facts which 
do not appear under a micro- 
scope or in an equation— 
which form a basic difference 
between Loyios and Earth- 
men. You have a drive, a will 
to succeed, that is terrible in 
its strength, and a little 
frightening. I think it is root- 
ed in your high emotion level, 
a compensatory factor for a 
certain lack of logic and self- 
control. Nevertheless, it has 
brought you far. 

“Honesty is ruthless, Mike, 
and ruthle,ssness is true kind- 
ness, as you will perhaps later 
learn. We do not think Niki 
feels for you that strong emo- 
tional attachment you know as 
love, and we consider her 
mating with you, a man far 
beneath her in cultural status, 
extremely unwise. We do not 
think she would be happy on 
Earth, and feel that the ad- 
justment from our way of life 
to yours is too much to ask 
of a young girl. You have 
many good points, but the bar- 
barian is too close beneath 
your surface. We have all 
voted against you, feeling that 
the differences in life ex- 
pectancy and background far 
outweigh a momentary physi- 
cal attraction such as Niki 
now admits she feels for you. 

by Joseph Green 




Niki is free to choose for her- 
self, of course, but few young 
girls go against their family's 
judgment.” 

T HERE was a bitter, brittle 
silence, and then Jakow 
said, in a voice unnaturally 
soft, “I am truly sorry to tell 
you this, Mike.” 

“Don’t be,” said Mike as he 
got heavily to his feet. He 
could not keep all the bitter- 
ness from his voice. “The ex- 
periment has been a success, 
hasn’t it? You have reams of 
data on an Earthman’s be- 
havior patterns while under 
stress. Dr. Carnacki needs the 
material I’m furnishing him. 
No one is hurt, Niki will for- 
get her temporary physical at- 



traction to a barbarian, and 
life will go on.” 

He walked to the door, 
shoulders slumping tiredly, 
then turned and said, “Only 
one comment. You people, 
Loyios or Earthman, who de- 
cide things with your heads 
without listening to your 
hearts make me sick. Very 
sick.” 

He walked across the shade- 
porch into the bright moon- 
light where his mount waited, 
and then he discovered what 
a little thing resentment is, 
and of what small importance 
words are. 

Niki, already in the saddle, 
was waiting for him. And 
there was a wide, happy smile 
on her lips. END

YOU 

and NOSTRADAMUS 

—CONTINUED 



ESPONSE to our chal- 
lenge — how good are you 
at predicting? — has been, as 
we predicted, interesting in- 
deed. 

To restate: What we are af- 
ter is logical prediction based 
on past events and present 
factors, on the premise that if 
you observe enough factors, 
and understand their trend, 
you can extend that trend into 
a probable future. We asked 
for the overall feeling of “If 
this goes on — ” and, as far as 
possible, an adherence to this 
form: 

Such-and-such has been hap- 
' * pening all along; 

: St>and-so has just occurred ; 

'Therefore I predict that in 
' v ‘ 90 days this will happen: 

62 



The reason we picked 90 
days was that, due to the nor- 
mal lag of magazine publish- 
ing and distribution, it takes 
that long for your responses 
to come back to you in print. 
The ideal prediction, then, 
would be one which would ap- 
pear on the newsstands at the 
same time as newspapers car- 
rying the same story. (This 
is being written on May 1, 
just to orient you: All I’d 
need to do to prove how 
smart I am would be to write 
here what you, reading this, 
call the lead article on this 
morning’s newspaper.) 

As promised, we give you 
here the most interesting of 
the predictions received to 
date. Mrs. Angelo Castagna, 
of Thompsonville, Gunn., 






sends not one, but four, and 
we follow each with our cont- 
inents in parenthesis. 

1 . 

“When they get the next 
man-powered capsule in orbit, 
although it may be blacked 
out by complete censorship, 
they will be met by a U.F.O. 
and allowed to know what 
solar system has us under ob- 
servation. It will be under 
mental communication rather 
than spoken language.” 

(Even George Adamski did 
not visualize space ships with 
pedals! I’m sure Mrs. C. 
meant “manned” rather than 
“man-powered”; as for the 
rest, either she’s right and 
we’ll never know — because of 
the censors — or. .well, she’s 
wrong.) 

2 . 

“The first public appeal 
will be made for people to do- 
nate parts of their bodies that 
are healthy to go into a bank 
for spare human parts similar 
to the eye banks that already 
are in use. The donors will be 
tattooed with a sign that they 
have given permission so that 
the part to be kept will be re- 
moved before deterioration 
sets in.” 

(Has anyone heard this ap- 
peal ?) 

3 . 

“The first actual hurricane 
dispersement will take effect 
in September that will cause 



the storm to be turned out to 
sea before it hits any of the 
coastal areas. The same tech- 
nique will then be used in the 
typhoon areas of the Pacific 
and the tornado belt of the 
middle West.” 

(File this until Sept.) 

4 . 

“There will be a definite ex- 
change of understandable 
speech between the porpoises 
and the men who have been 
studying them, and the por- 
poises will come up with some 
of the things that men have 
been trying to find out about 
for many centuries. But the 
porpoises will limit their 
talks to only the ones who can 
be trusted. They will not al- 
low themselves to become 
sideshow freaks.” 

(There’s that ol’ censorship 
again. If you’re right, Mrs. 
C., how can we know?) 

C ONGRATULATIONS and 
thanks to Mrs. Castagna. 
We hope we see many more 
predictions. We hope, too, 
that they will be checkable 
against concurrent news. The 
best predictions will be print- 
ed here, the best of all will 
win a free subscription to IF, 
and will surely provide a per- 
manent proof of our (slightly 
tattered, but still firm) con- 
viction that sf people really 
can think ahead. 

Our own predictions of two 
issues ago were outstanding. 
They were one hundred per 
cent wrong. EHIO

IF • Short Story 




WORLD 
IN A MIRROR 

BY ALBERT TEICHNER 

It was a backward world, all right — - 
in a special and very deadly manner! 



94 





G OD knows I didn’t want 
Hacker in the preliminary 
delegation right from the 
start. I wasn’t thinking, either, 
of the screwball ways history 
can go about poetically re- 
peating itself sometimes. I 
just knew that an uppity, 
smart-alecky kid of fifty 
could only cause trouble. 

He already had. 

Rayna had been our earlier 
landfall on the First Inter- 
stellar Expedition. It pos- 
sessed a fairly intelligent 
form of life, even if the Ray- 
nans were oviparous and tech- 
nologically retarded. Hacker 
had taken over the bulldozer 
to clear the area around our 
craft. Terra /, and he had been 
repeatedly told to stay very 
close to it. But no, he insisted 



on flattening out the peat-like 
top of the nearest hill too. 
Unfortunately that hilltop 
was an incubation bed for 
Raynan fledglings. The massa- 
cre involved not only a vast 
number of hatching eggs but 
five adult females, and we had 
to get away pronto while 
thousands of paper limbs 
waved threateningly at the 
murderers from Earth. 

I’m only the Science Chron- 
icler of this expedition but 
Dr. Barnes is Chief Medical 
Officer. His protests should 
have mattered where mine 
didn’t. ‘Tm a hundred per 
cent behind Johnson,” he told 
Captain Weber. “That kid’s no 
damned good. The three of us 
will go into town with these 
Newtaneans and, sure as I’m 



WORLD IN A MIRROR 



99 




standing here, Hacker will do 
something wrong.” 

Captain Weber, looking 
worried as usual, tried to ex- 
plain. “He'll just do the chauf- 
feuring.” But he got off that 
tack immediately when he saw 
we were not following along. 
“Look, I know he's a pest. But 
this is a political matter, for 
the good of the Space Corps. 
His great-great-uncle is Presi- 
dent of the World Council. 
For all I know the old man 
hates his guts, won’t listen to 
a word he says, but let’s not 
take any chances. We’re going 
to need plenty of these ex- 
peditions. And hyper-drive 
craft take an awful lot out of 
the economy.” 

The upshot of the matter 
was that we patriotically 
agreed to the setup. The cap- 
lain gave Hacker a good chew- 
ing-out about respecting the 
rights of the Newtaneans. 

The kid turned out to be 
surprisingly amenable on that 
score. “They're human!” he 
said, and I could see he was 
very sincere about it. “I 
wouldn't do anything to hurt 
them, sir. What’s more, they 
must be almost as smart as we 
arc and I’m not about to com- 
mit suicide.” 

So the three of us got into 
the jeep and rolled out of 
Terra I onto Newtane’s soil. 

I still felt uncomfortable 
about Hacker, though. He had 
tasted blood on Rayna and the 
effect of that on him had been 
unusually bad; he had ac- 
quired a reckless attitude to- 



ward the rights of intelligent 
life, his own included. 

A S if to prove me wrong, he 
drove very carefully over 
the special road the Newtane- 
ans had laid out overnight 
from our landing area to the 
highway a mile or so away. 
The three carloads of scowl- 
ing plenipotentiaries up ahead 
looked appealingly funny. 
While the Newtaneans were 
remarkably, even handsomely, 
like us (except for a certain 
closeness of the eyes and a 
reversed ordering of their fin- 
gers) their facial muscles car- 
ried different emotional con- 
victions. On our landing ten 
hours before those officials 
had thought our smiling faces 
indicated angry aggressive- 
ness and we had been equally 
uncertain about their inten- 
tions. But their Semanticizer 
had eventually made the true 
state of affairs clear. Evolu- 
tion had determined that an 
upward set of Newtanean fa- 
cial muscles meant a bad situa- 
tion, a downward set pleasure 
and cordiality. The more they 
scowled the more we smiled 
and everybody was very happy 
about the potential flowering 
of transgalactic culture that 
we were instituting. 

When we turned onto the 
magnificent superhighway, 
however, Hacker became furi- 
ous. He kept trying to pull 
over to the right but a steady 
stream of scarab-shaped cars, 
filled with curious sightseers, 
kept getting in hig hway. 



'This is crazy/' he cried. 

T think they drive on the 
left here/' Dr. Barnes tried to 
explain. 

'That's what I mean — 
they’re crazy !” 

“They did it that way in 
England for centuries,” I said. 
“It took a long time to get 
them to change.” 

“Fine, fine.” Suddenly he 
laughed, as if pleased with his 
capacity for tolerance. “If it’s 
good enough for them it’s 
good enough for us visitors. 
They sure know how to build 
beautiful roads!” 

I suppose I should have 
been pleased with this shift 
toward good humor but I 
wasn’t. I just could not like 
the youngster. He had been 
forgivably cocky for his age 
before, but now something 
nasty had been added. 

Still, he remained on his 
best behavior as we ap- 
proached Crona, the capital 
city.* Its golden towers 
gleamed in the sun and every- 
where there were crowds of 
beautiful tan people, waving 
to us and happily scowling 
their welcome. 

The lead cars stopped be- 
fore a particularly elegant 
skyscraper that was set in the 
middle of vast, symmetrical 
gardens. We got out and were 
greeted by dignitaries accom- 
panied by technicians with 
Semanticizing equipment. (If 
this equipment worked slowly,, 
it, was still faster than any 
we’d developed.) The men who 
came toward us were piizzled 



when we extended our hands 
but, once the translation came 
through and they understood 
it was an Earth custom, they 
copied our gesture. Only they 
all put out their left hands. 
It took a while before reason- 
able contact could be made. 

“Interestin g,” said Dr. 
Barnes. “They all seem to be 
left-handed.” 

“I don’t see what’s so inter- 
esting about that,” Hacker 
snorted through his puggish 
nose. “I’ve seen left-handed 
people on Earth.” 

“Good for you,” the doctor 
answered drily. 

Hacker looked a little an- 
noyed but for once managed 
to keep quiet. 

I explained to the receiving 
delegation how hyper-radio 
contact could be established 
with our system for informa- 
tion exchanges and then told 
them tomorrow’s group from 
Terra I would be much larger. 
It would be in a position to set 
out the technical arrangements 
in all the necessary detail. 

The dialogue crept along as 
translations were made, but 
finally an especially regal fig- 
ure stepped forward and told 
us the rest of the proceedings 
would take place within the 
building. We followed the 
Newtaneans into a hall so vast 
that we still seemed to be out- 
doors. Subtle colors . were 
playing free-form patterns pri 
the walls and the synesthetip 
reaction was that of hearing a 
music too beautiful, too per- 
fect, for the relative crudity 




of the human ear to grasp 
alone. “This,” Hacker laughed, 
“is my idea of heaven!” 

1 wasn’t about to unbend and 
openly agree with him on 
anything. But celestial it real- 
ly was. And then the subtly 
rich smells of the food began 
to play on our nostrils. It was 
brought out on great auto- 
matic servers and robot arms 
set heaping, steaming plates 
before the fifty Newtaneans. 
We, of course, had to refuse, 
taking out our compacted ra- 
tions and setting them before 
us. 

All the Newtaneans were 
still meat-eaters. The main 
course was a small fowl, 
thoroughly browned in gravy. 
For me the most interesting 
thing about it was that four 
drumstick legs stuck out of 
each torso rather than the 
regulation two found on all 
earth-based birds. For Hacker, 
though, a more practical mat- 
ter was involved. 

“I’d sure like to try a help- 
ing of that bird,” he said. 

The two of us, naturally, 
were shocked. “That must 
have been a living creature 
once,” said Barnes. 

“So what?” 

“Well, our civilization is es- 
sentially vegetarian. They just 
haven’t reached our level as 
yet in that respect.” 

“Nuts loaf to you!” Hacker 
snapped. “And synthetic yeast 
pie too! I’ve eaten flesh.” 
That really upset me. I 
know there’s still a little sur- 



reptitious meat-consumption 
on Earth — genetics shows we 
must get a few throwbacks In 
every generation — but I’d nev- 
er before met anyone who 
openly boasted about it. Syn- 
thetic foods meet gourmet 
needs better than traditional, 
ones do anyway. (Of course, I 
don’t mean the dull compacted 
stuff we get on long space 
hops but the food served on 
Terran planets themselves.) 
Any Earthman eating flesh 
back home is deliberately try- 
ing to taste the atavistic sensa- 
tions of savagery. 

“You know how immoral 
that is,” I told him. 

“Hacker, let’s forget the 
moral issue,” Barnes said, con- 
sidering him with disgust. 
“Let’s just be sensible. We 
don’t know enough about 
Newtane yet to eat anything .” 

Hacker laughed. “Why, it 
smells just like our own food, 
only better.” He picked at his 
vita-concentrate. “Oh, let’s 
forget about the whole thing.” 

We tried to. Several digni- 
taries rose to their full seven 
feet and spoke slowly into 
Semanticizers, flinging their 
queer hands out for emphasis 
with their thumbs waving 
where our pinkies do. Sudden- 
ly, though, Hacker got up 
from his seat and hurried 
down the long table to the 
place where the 1 e a d i n g 
spokesman was eating. He 
leaned over him, speaking into 
the nearest translator, and I 
could see the Newtanean smil- 
ing broadly, as if trying to re- 



98 




fuse something, while Hacker 
frowned. Finally the smile 
faded into a friendly scowl. 
Nothing good could be coming 
out of this. 

A minute later a robot arm 
proffered a loaded plate to 
Hacker and he started back to 
us with it. Barnes rose to stop 
him, but before Hacker 
reached us he had taken two 
mouthfuls of the meat, 

I have never seen such sheer 
self-satisfied delight on a 
human face as after those first 
bites. 

“You shouldn’t be doing 
that,” Barnes said when he sat 
down next to us again. 

“You’re just old fogies,” 
Hacker grunted through a 
meat-stuffed mouth. “This is 
the best food I’ve ever eaten.” 

He somehow shoveled an- 
other load of meat between his 
lips. 

Thirty seconds later his 
face twisted into a caricature 
of the human physiognomy, all 
writhing lines, as if every 
muscle were breaking loose 
from its neighbors. The last 
unswallowed portion of food 
erupted from his mouth and 
he fell forward into the vile 
mess. 

He was dead. 

P ANDEMONIUM spread 
through the hall. Every- 
where wildly smiling faces ex- 
pressed despair at such an end 
for an honored guest. Barnes 
sprang into action, pulling the 
portable medical kit from his 
belt and immediately starting 

WORLD IN A MIRROR 



blood tests while some native 
doctors joined him with their 
emergency equipment. “Must 
start revitalizing immediate- 
ly,” he said, then stopped, 
ashen-faced, as he studied an 
analyzer tube. “Fantastic! No, 
it can’t be !” 

The Newtaneans were equal- 
ly bewildered. They rushed 
Hacker to a nearby treatment 
chamber. All I could do was 
wait, while the Newtanean 
leader explained that Hacker 
had told him we had author- 
ized his trying the food. 
There was no need to doubt 
his story. It was just what the 
kid would have done. I did my 
best to assure him that we 
knew his intentions had been 
honorable. 

A half-hour later Barnes re- 
turned, a robot platform fol- 
lowing with Hacker, body cov- 
ered by a preservative glaze, 
on it. 

“Nothing can be done,” he 
said. “I’ve tried everything. 
Hacker’s too thoroughly dead 
for anything ever to bring him 
back. We’ll just have to take 
his body home for further 
study.” 

“But what killed him?” I 
demanded. 

“A dozen or so things out of 
a thousand possibilities.” 

“You mean you don’t have 
any idea?” 

“Oh, I have some idea. Too 
many ideas in fact. Look, 
Johnson, chemistry’s not your 
specialty but this is fairly 
elementary. All life contains 
protein, right Y 9 



99 




“Right." 

“And all protein consists of 
amino acids. Every natural 
protein back home is built on 
levo — left turn — amino acids. 
Here it is just the opposite, 
the mirror image of what we 
know. Every amino acid is 
dextro — to the right!" 

“But how can it be differ- 
ent here?" 

“Johnson, they could ask 
the same question about us 
with equal justification — or, 
rather, equal lack of justifica- 
tion." 

I was trying to feel my way 
through the confusion. 
“Barnes, I know a world could 
be made of anti-matter but — " 

“No, no. Anti-matter is a re- 
versal of changes within the 
atom. These atoms are the 
same as ours. It’s the organiza- 
tion that is different — regular 
molecules with a different 
twist." 

“But why should it have 
killed him then? We absorb 
starch and reject cellulose 
which is closely related. But 
the body just refuses to accept 
the cellulose. It doesn’t neces- 
sarily go ahead and die." 

“Starch and cellulose are 
both dextro, old man. This is 
a more fundamental differ- 
ence. Maybe the body just 
throws off some of these com- 
pounds too. But there were 
some — plenty, I suspect — it 
couldn’t throw off." He 
glanced toward the stiffening 
corpse, sympathetically. 

“The poor kid couldn’t 
leave well enough alone."

W r ELL, we are two univer- 
sal days out from New- 
tane and soon we will drop 
from hyper-drive as we reach 
the orbit of Pluto. I shouldn't 
still be feeling as uneasy as I 
do. I’m sure I shouldn’t. We 
have had five friendly, in- 
formative days with the peo- 
ple of a great civilization re- 
markably like ours, and Presi- 
dent Hacker has radioed he 
understands perfectly that we 
were not responsible for the 
tragedy, nobody was. The kid, 
it seems, wasn’t the apple of 
his eye anyway. 

Ninety men and one corpse 
returning to the security of 
terra firma. I should, when all 
is said and done, be happy 
with the way most things have 
worked out. But I am a Chron- 
icler and I know the peculiar- 
ly symbolic, seemingly super- 
ficial ways in which history 
manages to repeat itself. 

It is more than three centu- 
ries since the last War on 
Earth between rightists and 
leftists. That was a matter of 
differing concepts of econom- 
ics and politics. I can’t help 
wondering, though, whether 
there are not even more funda- 
mental points of eventual con- 
flict in the universe that we 
have barely discovered. If 
there are, I’m beginning to 
suspect they’ll still have some- 
thing to do with the unfath- 
omable difference between 
Right and Left, a difference 
that took many lives centuries 
ago — and may not be through 
with us yet. ' END

JUST 

WESTING 



. BY THEODORE STURGEON 



B ENT on a midnight raid, 
we flung open the door of 
our refrigerator the other 
night. We found ourselves, in 
the sudden glare of light from 
the open door, face to face 
with a large rabbit. 

“What,” we demanded, "are 
you doing in the refriger- 
ator?” 

“This is a Westinghouse, 
isn’t it?” asked the rabbit. 
“Yes—” 

“Well,” said the rabbit, 
“I’m just westing.” 

Having discharged this an- 
ecdote, without which we are 
incapable of discussing West- 
inghouse, we may proceed. 

When George Westing- 
house opened his first enter- 
prise in Garrison Alley, Pitts- 
burgh, two hundred employ- 
ees worked in 20,000 square 
feet of space to manufacture 
13 products — motors, switch- 
es, generators and the like. 
Now that 75 years have 
passed, over a hundred thou- 



sand people work for the 
company in 63 major manu- 
facturing plants, 39 manufac- 
turing and repair plants and 
142 sales offices, making 
300,000 variations of around 
800 basic products. Among 
these many activities, one has 
been, as any perceptive reader 
of these pages can attest, to 
feed your Feature Depart- 
ment much fascinating materi- 
al in science and technology. 
The very least we can do in 
recognition of Westinghouse's 
75th anniversary is to have a 
look at it and its works. (Oth- 
er young strong enterprises 
please copy.) 

Each year an issue of West- 
inghouse’s handsome house 
organ, the bimonthly West- 
inghouse Engineer , is given 
over to an annual engineering 
review. To find out what the 
company is up to in a twelve- 
month, we could hardly do 
better than to riffle through 
it. 

An editorial by the Vice 

101 





President in charge of en- 
gineering, Mr. J. A. Hutche- 
son, contains one remark of 
special interest to the dis- 
cerning sf reader, for it would 
seem that for many years now 
we have, in a lofty and knowl- 
edgeable way, deplored the 
increasing compartmentation 
of the sciences, and the ap- 
parent lack of communication 
between one specialist and an- 
other, as if we educated con- 
sumers knew something the 
big boys did not. Well, listen 
at the man: 

“The knowledgeable reader 
can... peer behind the scenes 
and note many changes occur- 
ring in technology itself, in 
the basic approaches to tech- 
nical problems. For one thing, 
the classic distinctions be- 
tween the scientist and the 
engineer, between research 
and development, are becom- 
ing hazier, and may ultimate- 
ly disappear. In many ad- 
vanced technology projects 
today, the dividing line is dif- 
ficult to determine, and fre- 
quently the same scientist or 
engineer may be required to 
carry the project through all 
stages. This points squarely 
toward the need for versatili- 
ty in tomorrow’s scientist-en- 
gineer, if he is to cope with 
the technology of his day.” 

Hosanna ! 

Now let’s look at a year’s 
work at Westinghouse. Please 
bear in mind that we can’t go 
into detail about all that fol- 
lows; if we did we’d crowd 
all the stories out of this issue 



of IF, and the next one too. 
If any of it catches your fancy 
and you’d like to know more, 
by all means write; what we 
don’t have on hand we can 
probably find out, or make 
the right referral for you. 
Also please don’t fight with 
me if you know that one or 
another of the items and ef- 
forts mentioned below are not 
Westinghouse inventions 
(though a good many are.) 
The company does an im- 
mense amount of development 
work on ideas and devices 
from all over. 

Power Generation , trans- 
mission, and distribution . 
Westinghouse has been up to 
the earlobes in nuclear energy 
for a long time now. This 
year sees operation of a new 
core for the reactor-generator 
at Shippingport, Pa. The im- 
prived core ups the output 
two and a half times, and re- 
duces the fuel cost by more 
than 60%. New atomic power- 
houses started operation in 
Rowe, Mass, and Mol, Bel- 
gium (this the first commer- 
cial reactor to be exported 
from the U. S.) and construc- 
tion went forward on new nu- 
clear power plants in New 
Bedford, Pa., and in the south 
for the Carolinas-Virginia 
Co. Designs were completed 
for two really big ones, one 
at Chooz, France, and another 
in southern California — 
which, with the world’s 
largest atomic reactor and a 
360 million watt output, would 
be the biggest yet.

Along with power sources, 
the company preoccupies it- 
self with the turbines driven 
by that power, the generators 
that make usable energy from 
it, and the equipment which 
distributes it. One of the 
most interesting new com- 
plexes goes into service about 
now in Sewaren, N. J. Im- 
pressively large (342 mega- 
watts) it' is also so highly au- 
tomated it is all but spooky. 
Hundreds of operating vari- 
ables are monitored and con- 
trolled by a computer called 
Pro da c (a Westinghouse 
trademark) which has a built- 
in “priority director,” allow- 
ing the computer to switch 
from one program to another 
depending upon the urgency 
of any of the thousands of 
decisions that the computer 
has to make. 

We’ll slide past some aston- 
ishing developments in tur- 
bines (you wouldn’t think 
anything as simple and basic 
as a turbine could be im- 
proved; but they keep on do- 
ing . it) and generators (two 
new 3600 rpm monsters which 
operate at 2000 lbs pressure) 
to a real sf heading (Trinistat 
Joins Mag-a-stat) which deals 
with a new use for Trinistor, 
a solid-state rectifier, coupled 
with a power-control; it ap- 
proaches the ultimate in speed 
of response and veratility in 
generator control, separation 
of electrodes in arc devices 
and the like; Insuldur, a new 
insulator for power trans- 
formers which will permit 



utilities to carry heavier loads 
with the same equipment, or 
deliver their rated loads for 
a much longer time; a new 
test-transformer to test giant 
power transformers, so big it 
must be shipped on two over- 
sized depressed-center flat- 
cars and, assembled, measures 
16’ x 34*, is 42’ high and 
weighs 440 tons. 

Here’s a new tap-changer 
for limiting current when 
switching high-voltage lines, 
a gadget for winding heavy 
transformer coils six at a time 
(and producing a highly im- 
proved coil in the process), a 
new method of voltage regu- 
lation, circuit breakers which 
interrupt the arc between 
opening switchpoints with 
puffs of gas, and new low- 
voltage and telemetering sys- 
tems for power distribution. 

And here’s a high-capacity 
watt-hour meter, with bear- 
ings that bear on nothing at 
all ! Magnets built into the 
rotor shaft and supporting 
cup repel one another and 
suspend the whole rotor as- 
sembly in space, without fric- 
tion. 

Applications of Power. Au- 
tomatic controls are the big 
thing here — “brains” which 
stoke blast furnaces, control 
to the thousandth of an inch 
the speeding bands of paper 
in its manufacture, and many 
other applications, and the in- 
genious components which 
make it all happen. Here’s the 
Trinistor again, starting and 



NfiUififiSiHft 



103 



stopping a two hp motor a 
million and a quarter times in 
a test to see how long it can 
keep it up. (Forever, appar- 
ently. The Trinistor, a solid- 
state gadget, does this switch- 
ing with no moving parts.) 
And here’s some fingertip 
controls with which you can 
handle the 750-ton crane spe- 
cially built to handle the new 
590-ton, 150,000 kw generator 
rotors (13 of ’em) for the new 
Niagara power plant. And an 
incredible new hoist-motor 1 * 
system for swift handling of 
heavy loads where, at the same 
time, precision and safety are 
factors, in such jobs as ship- 
loading. This system makes 
the descending load generate 
electricity to help raise it, 
brake it and put it where you 
say it should go. And here’s 
an array of new electric mo- 
tor designs — smaller, stronger, 
cooler and simpler. One of 
them eliminates the field coils 
on the hundreds of small mo- 
tors used to turn the rollers 
on the run-out tables in steel 
mills. 

Control and distribution de- 
vices. So many of those trans- 
former boxes you see on pow- 
er poles near your house are 
of standard size, while de- 
mands keep on growing, that 
brains have to be cracked on 
the problem of putting more 
circuits and more capacity in- 
side the boxes, and while 
making components smaller, 
making them better. This is 
being done in the develop- 



ment and design of new con- 
tactors, circuit breakers, in- 
sulators and controls. Some of 
them are designed to protect 
extremely delicate electronic 
devices from voltage surges, 
and for them a new system 
(and a new word) of hynetic 
(hydraulic magnetic) circuit 
breaking. The gimmick is to 
vary, by magnetism, the vis- 
cosity of a fluid in a hydraulic 
system! 

Lamps and Lighting. Here 
are some of the most fasci- 
nating developments of all. It 
has long been known by en- 
gineers that the brightest and 
most efficient phosphors — 
chemicals which glow under 
electrical excitation — can’t be 
used for ordinary lights be- 
cause they are green. Your 
girl just wouldn’t appreciate 
your gazing at her in green 
light. Within the past year, 
Westinghouse engineers have 
found that by a precise blend- 
ing of red phosphors in the 
green, they can produce a new 
white light. In spite of the 
steady improvement in flu- 
orescents in past years, this 
one is startling; with the 
same wattage it yields 15% 
more than the Cool White, 
11% more than White, and a 
huge 26% more than the Day- 
light lamp. Best of all, these 
new lamps have nothing spe- 
cial but the new phosphors, 
and are directly interchange- 
able with the old models. Im- 
provements have been made in 
mercury-vapor lamps as well. 



104 







Due to vl new filament, you 
can get 34% more light out of 
a 250 watt mere than before. 

Another fine, lighting de- 
velopment is designed for 
what airline pilots call the 
“black hole” — the unlighted 
runway center in which they 
must touch down. A new cen- 
terline lamp is set into holes 
on the centerline one inch 
deep and eight inches in di- 
ameter. With lamp, lens, con- 
tacts, gaskets and fittings in- 
stalled, the. light projects only 
above the surface, giving 
a bright centerline while be- 
ing immune to rolling wheels, 
snowplows or extremes in 
temperature. 

Roads get attention from 
the company’s lighting en- 
gineers, too. A new “lu- 
minaire” called the OV-50, 
can increase street and high- 
way lighting 50 to 90% — or 
maintain it at present levels 
at correspondingly less cost. 
And in another device lies a 
revolution in home and shop 
lighting — a fluorescent tube 
bent into a “labyrinth” so that 
overall, it’s square, not long. 
A light like this can be set 
flush in wall or ceiling and 
contains its own dirtproof re- 
flector. 

Semiconductors and elec- 
tronics drew so much atten- 
tion for the year that we’ll 
have to skim again. There’s a 
new technique, the frame grid, 
which much improves the 
quality and life of the tuner 
and rf amplifier bottles in the 

JUST WESTING 



front end of your TV set ; be- 
cause of it the image will go 
further yet away from the 
rounded rectangle to the 
square look. A fabulous image 
amplifier, the Astracon, can 
take in one photon of light 
and put out 10,000 at the other 
end. What this will do for the 
astronomy business we can 
only begin to guess. There’s 
a new vidicon for weather 
satellites only y 2 ” in di- 
ameter and a super-rugged 
orthicon for low-light work 
such as satellite tracking. An- 
other vidicon eliminates mag- 
netic deflection coils, making 
for much smaller TV cameras 
and extremely narrow-band 
transmission; it makes it pos- 
sible to send visual informa- 
tion over conventional phone 
lines instead of special cable. 
An “ionization gauge” will 
measure the degree of vacuum 
of outer space in the range 
of 10 4 to 10 13 millimeters of 
mercury; the best up to now 
has been 10 10 . 

The Trinistor we mentioned 
before, a solid-state rectifier 
which acts as a control gate 
for current flow, has been de- 
signed up to capacities in the 
order of 50 amps at 300 con- 
tinuous volts and can take 
1000-volt surges; you’ll have 
to stop thinking of semi-con- 
ductors as gadgets merely for 
portable radios. The con- 
trolled dendritic process for 
“growing” amplifiers by the 
yard — we did an article on 
this for you recently — pro- 
ceeds apace, and there’s a new 

105 




array of thermo-electric de- 
vices useful for cooling elec- 
tronic components by turning 
heat directly into electricity. 
Solid-state inverters are now 
in use, turning dc into ac in 
underwater repeaters in tele- 
phone cable. Finally, there’s 
the Televex system, medical 
x-rays coupled to TV, which 
can better the dim old fluoro- 
scopic screen by 50,000 times 
and put it on TV monitors 
any way you like — for a class- 
room, say, or a roomful of 
doctors in consultation. 

Marine and Aviation. The 
company contributed to the 
year’s most spectacular, and 
the year’s most impressive 
events in these fields — the 
first underwater launching of 
Polaris, and the launching of 
the big flat-top Enterprise , 
which is powered by eight 
Westinghouse nuclear reac- 
tors. Work proceeds on nu- 
clear propulsion for the Long 
Beach , a guided missile cruis- 
er. And the fleet of nuclear 
subs, non-existent only six 
years ago, has been increased 
to 42 built or authorized. 

A strictly-from-sf gadget is 
the dredge Markham , which 
uses a company device called 
Magamp — a magnetic ampli- 
fier — to control the electric 
drive at variable speeds and 
directions, while the diesel 
generators rotate at set rpm. 
Time was that only steam 
could do heavy dredging, be- 
cause steam engines can stop 
without stalling. The Magamp 



whips this problem. Another 
unique feature of the ship is 
a transverse bow tunnel with 
a big reversible prop in it, 
making the vessel superbly 
maneuverable at the lowest 
speeds and worst cross-cur- 
rent conditions. 

Cocktails, anyone? There’s 
a shaker device for vibration 
testing which does away with 
mechanical linkages. A heavy 
magnesium plate rides on a 
film of oil on an optically flat 
granite block. The plate is 
driven much as is your hi-fi 
speaker, by armatures moving 
in the air-gap of electromag- 
nets. The 22” x 32” table can 
handle massive loads and 
shake them through a half- 
inch travel up to 2000 times 
a second. 

A heater for super-velocity 
wind-tunnels can deliver a 
3400 mile-per-hour blast of air 
at 10,000° F. Special low-in- 
ductance capacitors (which 
can store up relatively small 
amounts of energy, release it 
suddenly in enormous surges) 
are pushing us through the 
beachheads of controlled fu- 
sion. Other capacitors are 
used for “hot shot” re-entry 
simulation, turning loose a 
flow similar to speeds from 
Mach 9 to Mach 24. 

There’s lots more. Let us 
close with the simple observa- 
tion that if one of several 
companies can rack up a score 
like this, the capitalist system 
is not doing so bad after all!

CULTURAL 

EXCHANGE 



It was a simple student exchange 
— but Retief gave them more of 
an education than they expected! 

BY KEITH LAUMER Illustrated by R. D. Francis 



I 

S ECOND Secretary Mag- 
nan took his green-lined 
cape and orange-feathered be- 
ret from the clothes tree. “I'm 
off now, Retief,” he said. “I 
hope you’ll manage the ad- 
ministrative routine during 
my absence without any un- 
fortunate incidents.” 

“That seems a modest 
enough hope,” Retief said. 
“I'll try to live up to it.” 

“I don’t appreciate frivolity 
with reference to this Divi- 
sion,” Magnan said testily. 
“When I first came here, the 
Manpower Utilization Direc- 
torate, Division of Libraries 
and Education was a 
shambles. I fancy I’ve made 
MUDDLE what it is today. 



Frankly, I question the wis- 
dom of placing you in charge 
of such a sensitive desk, even 
for two weeks. But remember. 
Yours is purely a rubber- 
stamp function.” 

“In that case, let’s leave it 
to Miss Furkle. I’ll take a 
couple of weeks off myself. 
With her poundage, she could 
bring plenty of pressure to 
bear.” 

“I assume you jest, Retief,” 
Magnan said sadly. “I should 
expect even you to appreciate 
that Bogan participation in 
the Exchange Program may 
be the first step toward sub- 
limation of their aggressions 
into more cultivated chan- 
nels.” 

“I see they’re sending two 
thousand students to d’Land,” 



107 





Retief said, glancing at the 
Memo for Record. ‘"That’s a 
sizable sublimation.” 

Magnan nodded. ‘‘The Bo- 
gans have launched no less 
than four military campaigns 
in the last two decades. 
They’re known as the Hood- 
lums of the Nicodemean 
Cluster. Now, perhaps, we 
shall see them breaking that 
precedent and entering into 
the cultural life of the Gal- 
axy.” 

“Breaking and entering,” 
Retief said. “You may have 
something there. But I’m 
wondering what they'll study 
on d’Land. That’s an indus- 
trial world of the poor but 
honest variety.” 

“Academic details are the 
affair of the students and 
their professors,” Magnan 
said. “Our function is merely 
to bring them together. See 
that you don’t antagonize the 
Bogan representative. This 
will be an excellent opportu- 
nity for you to practice your 
diplomatic restrain t — not 
your strong point, I’m sure 
you’ll agree.” 

A buzzer sounded. Retief 
punched a button. “What is it, 
Miss Furkle?” 

“That — bucolic person from 
Lovenbroy is here again.” On 
the small desk screen, Miss 
Furkle’s meaty features were 
compressed in disapproval. 

“This fellow’s a confound- 
ed pest. I’ll leave him to you, 
Retief,” Magnan said. “Tell 
him something. Get rid of 
him. And remember: here at 

108 



Corps HQ, all eyes are upon 
you.” 

“If I’d thought of that, I’d 
have worn my other suit,” Re- 
tief said. 

Magnan snorted and passed 
from view. Retief punched 
Miss Furkle’s button. 

“Send the bucolic person 
in.” 

A tall broad man with 
bronze skin and gray 
hair, wearing tight trousers 
of heavy cloth, a loose shirt 
open at the neck and a short 
jacket, stepped into the room. 
He had a bundle under his 
arm. He paused at sight of 
Retief, looked him over mo- 
mentarily, then advanced and 
held out his hand. Retief 
took it. For a moment the 
two big men stood, face to 
face. The newcomer’s jaw 
muscles knotted. Then he 
winced. 

Retief dropped his hand 
and motioned to a chair. 

“That’s nice knuckle work, 
mister,” the stranger said, 
massaging his hand. “First 
time anybody ever did that to 
me. My fault though. I start- 
ed it, I guess.” He grinned 
and sat down. 

“What can I do for you?" 
Retief said. 

“You work for this Culture 
bunch, do you? Funny. I 
thought they were all ribbon- 
counter boys. Never mind. 
I’m Hank Arapoulous. I’m a 
farmer. What I wanted to see 
you about was — ” He shifted 
in his chair. “Well, out on 

by Keith Laumet: 




Lovenbroy we’ve got a seri- 
ous problem. The wine crop is 
just about ready. We start 
picking in another two, three 
months. Now I don’t know if 
you're familiar with the Bac- 
chus vines we grow . ?” 
“No,” Retief said. “Have a 
cigar?" He pushed a box 
across the desk. Arapoulous 
took one. “Bacchus vines are 
an unusual crop,” he said, 
puffing the cigar alight. 
“Only mature every twelve 
years. In between, the vines 
don't need a lot of attention, 
so our time’s mostly our own. 
We like to farm, though. 
Spend a lot of time develop- 
ing new forms. Apples the 
size of a melon — and sweet — ” 
“Sounds very pleasant,” 
Retief said. “Where does the 
Libraries and Education Di- 
vision come in?” 

Arapoulous leaned forward. 
“We go in pretty heavy for 
the arts. Folks can’t spend all 
their time hybridizing plants. 
We’ve turned all the land 
area we’ve got into parks and 
farms. Course, we left some 
sizable forest areas for hunt- 
ing and such. Lovenbroy’s a 
nice place, Mr. Retief.” 

“It sounds like it, Mr. 
Arapoulous. Just what — ” 
“Call me Hank. We've got 
long seasons back home. Five 
of ’em. Our year’s about 
eighteen Terry months. Cold 
as hell in winter; eccentric 
orbit, you know. Blue-black 
sky, stars visible all day. We 
do mostly painting and sculp- 
ture in the winter. Then 



Spring; still plenty cold. Lots 
of skiing, bob-sledding, ice 
skating; and it’s the season 
for woodworkers. Our furni- 
ture—” 

“I’ve seen some of your fur- 
niture,” Retief said. “Beauti- 
ful work.” 

Arapoulous nodded. “All lo- 
cal timbers too. Lots of metals 
in our soil and those sul- 
phates give the woods some 
color, I’ll tell you. Then 
comes the Monsoon. Rain — it 
comes down in sheets. But 
the sun’s g e 1 1 i n g closer. 
Shines all the time. Ever 
seen it pouring rain in the 
sunshine? That’s the music- 
writing season. Then sum- 
mer. Summer’s hot. We stay 
inside in the daytime and 
have beach parties all night. 
Lots of beach on Lovenbroy; 
we’re mostly islands. That’s 
the drama and symphony 
time. The theatres are set up 
on the sand, or anchored off- 
shore. You have the music and 
the surf and the bonfires and 
stars — we’re close to the cen- 
ter of a globular cluster, you 
know. ” 

“You say it’s time now for 
the wine crop?” 

“That’s right. Autumn’s our 
harvest season. Most years we 
have just the ordinary crops. 
Fruit, grain, that kind of 
thing; getting it in doesn’t 
take long. We spend most of 
the time on architecture, get- 
ing new places ready for the 
winter or remodeling the 
older ones. We spend a lot of 
time in our houses. We like

to have them comfortable. 
But this year’s different. This 
is Wine Year.” 

A RAPOULOUS puffed on 
his cigar, looked worried- 
ly at Retief. “Our wine crop 
is our big money crop,” he 
said. “We make enough to 
keep us going. But this 
year. .” 

“The crop isn’t panning 
out?” 

“Oh, the crop’s fine. One 
of the best I can remember. 
Course, I’m only twenty- 
eight ; I can’t remember but 
two other harvests. The prob- 
lem’s not the crop.” 

“Have you lost your mar- 
kets? That sounds like a mat- 
ter for the Commercial — ” 
“Lost our markets? Mister, 
nobody that ever tasted our 
wines ever settled for any- 
thing else!” 

“It sounds like I’ve been 
missing something,” said Re- 
tief. “I’ll have to try them 
some time.” 

Arapoulous put his bundle 
on the desk, pulled off the 
wrappings. “No time like the 
present,” he said. 

Retief looked at the two 
squat bottles, one green, one 
amber, both dusty, with faded 
labels, and blackened corks 
secured by wire. 

“D r i n k i n g on duty is 
frowned on in the Corps, Mr. 
Arapoulous,” he said. 

“This isn’t drinking. It’s 
just wine.” Arapoulous pulled 
the wire retainer loose, 
thumbed the cork. It rose 



slowly, then popped in the 
air. Arapoulous caught it. 
Aromatic fumes wafted from 
the bottle. “Besides, my feel- 
ings would be hurt if you 
didn’t join me.” He winked. 

Retief took two tliin-walled 
glasses from a table beside 
the desk. “Come to think of 
it, we also have to be careful 
about violating quaint native 
customs.” 

Arapoulous filled the glass- 
es. Retief picked one up, 
sniffed the deep rust-colored 
fluid, tasted it, then took a 
healthy swallow. He looked 
at Arapoulous thoughtfully. 

“Hmmm. It tastes like salt- 
ed pecans, with an undercur- 
rent of crusted port.” 

“Don’t try to describe it, 
Mr. Retief,” Arapoulous said. 
He took a mouthful of wine, 
swished it around his teeth, 
swallowed. “It’s Bacchus 
wine, that’s all. Nothing like 
it in the Galaxy.” He pushed 
the second bottle toward Re- 
tief. “The custom back home 
is to alternate red wine and 
black.” 

R ETIEF put aside his cigar, 
pulled the wires loose, 
nudged the cork, caught it as 
it popped up. 

“Bad luck if you miss the 
cork,” Arapoulous said, nod- 
ding. “You probably never 
heard about the trouble we 
had on Lovenbroy a few 
years back?” 

“Can’t say that I did, 
Hank.” Retief poured the 
black wine into two fresh

glasses. “Here's to the har- 
vest." 

“We’ve got plenty of min- 
erals on Lovenbroy," Arapou- 
lous said, swallowing wine. 
“But we don’t plan to wreck 
the landscape mining ’em. We 
like to farm. About ten years 
back some neighbors of ours 
landed a force. They figured 
they knew better what to do 
with our minerals than we 
did. Wanted to strip-mine, 
smelt ore. We convinced ’em 
otherwise. But it took a year, 
and we lost a lot of men." 

“That’s too bad," Retief 
said. “I’d say this one tastes 
more like roast beef and pop- 
corn over a Riesling base." 

“It put us in a bad spot,” 
Arapoulous went on. “We 
had to borrow money from a 
world called Croanie. Mort- 
gaged our crops. Had to start 
exporting art work too. Plen- 
ty of buyers, but it’s not the 
same when you’re doing it for 
strangers." 

“Say, this business-of alter- 
nating drinks is the real Mc- 
Coy," Retief said. “What’s the 
problem? Croanie about to 
foreclose?" 

“Well, the loan’s due. The 
wine crop would put us in 
the clear. But we need harvest 
hands. Picking Bacchus 
grapes isn’t a job you can 
turn over to machinery — and 
anyway we wouldn’t if we 
could. Vintage season is the 
high point of living on Lov- 
enbroy. Everybody joins in. 
First, there’s the picking in 
the fields. Miles and miles of 



vineyards covering the moun- 
tain sides, and crowding the 
river banks, with gardens here 
and there. Big vines, eight 
feet high, loaded with fruit, 
and deep grass growing be- 
tween. The wine-carriers keep 
on the run, bringing wine to 
the pickers. There’s prizes for 
the biggest day’s output, bets 
on who can fill the most bas- 
kets in an hour. The sun’s 
high and bright, and it’s just 
cool enough to give you plen- 
ty of energy. Come nightfall, 
the tables are set up in the 
garden plots, and the feast is 
laid on : roast turkeys, beef, 
hams, all kinds of fowl. Big 
salads. Plenty of fruit. Fresh- 
baked bread. .and wine, plen- 
ty of wine. The cooking’s 
done by a different crew each 
night in each garden, and 
there’s prizes for the best 
crews. 

“Then the wine-making. We 
still tramp out the vintage. 
That’s mostly for the young 
folks but anybody’s welcome. 
That’s when things start to 
get loosened up. Matter of 
fact, pretty near half our 
young-uns are born after a 
vintage. All bets are off then. 
It keeps a fellow on his toes 
though. Ever tried to hold 
onto a gal wearing nothing but 
a layer of grape juice?" 

£4 , ^TEVER did," Retief said. 

“You say most of the 
children are born after a vin- 
tage. That would make them 
only twelve years old by the 
time—"

“Oh, that’s Lovenbroy 
years; they’d be eighteen, 
Terry reckoning.” 

“I was thinking you looked 
a little mature for twenty- 
eight,” Retief said. 

“Forty-two, Terry years,” 
Arapoulous said. “But this 
year it looks bad. We’ve got 
a bumper crop — and we’re 
short-handed. If we don’t get 
a big vintage, Croanie steps 
in. Lord knows what they’ll 
do to the land. Then next vin- 
tage time, with them holding 
half our grape acreage — ” 
“You hocked the vine- 
yards?” 

“Yep. Pretty dumb, huh? 
But we figured twelve years 
was a long time.” 

“On the whole,” Retief 
said, “I think I prefer the 
black. But the red is hard to 
beat. ” 

“What we figured was, may- 
be you Culture boys could 
help us out. A loan to see us 
through the vintage, enough 
to hire extra hands. Then we’d 
repay it in sculpture, paint- 
ing, furniture — ” 

“Sorry, Hank, All we do 
here is work out itineraries 
for traveling side-shows, that 
kind of thing. Now, if you 
needed a troop of Groaci nose- 
flute players — ” 

“Can they pick grapes?” 
“Nope. Anyway, they can’t 
stand the daylight. Have you 
talked this over with the La- 
bor Office?” 

“Sure did. They said they’d 
fix us up with all the elec- 
tronics specialists and com- 

112 



puter programmers we want- 
ed — but no field hands. Said 
it was what they classified as 
menial drudgery; you’d have 
thought I was trying to buy 
slaves.” 

The buzzer sounded. Miss 
Furkle’s features appeared on 
the desk screen. 

“You’re due at the Inter- 
group Council in five min- 
utes,” she said. “Then after- 
wards, there are the Bogan 
students to meet.” 

“Thanks.” Retief finished 
his glass, stood. “I have to 
run, Hank,” he said. “Let me 
think this over. Maybe I can 
come up with something. 
Check with me day after to- 
morrow. And you’d better 
leave the bottles here. Cul- 
tural exhibits, you know.” 

II 

A S the council meeting 
broke up, Retief caught 
the eye of a colleague across 
the table. 

“Mr. Whaffle, you men- 
tioned a shipment going to a 
place called Croanie. What 
are they getting?” 

Whaffle blinked. “You’re 
the fellow who’s filling in for 
Magnan, over at MUDDLE,” 
he said. “Properly speaking, 
equipment grants are the sole 
concern of the Motorized 
Equipment Depot, Division of 
Loans and Exchanges.” He 
pursed his lips. “However, I 
suppose there’s no harm in 
telling you. They’ll be receiv- 
ing heavy mining equipment.” 
by Keith Leu mer 




“Drill rigs, that sort of 
thing ?” 

“Strip mining gear.” Whaf- 
fle took a slip of paper from 
a breast pocket, blinked at it. 
“Bolo Model WV/1 tractors, 
to be specific. Why is MUD- 
DLE interested in MED- 
DLE’s activities ?” 

“Forgive -my curiosity, Mr. 
Whaffle. It’s just that Croan- 
ie cropped up earlier today. 
It seems she holds a mortgage 
on some vineyards over on — ” 

“That’s not MEDDLE’s af- 
fair, sir,” Whaffle cut in. “I 
have sufficient problems as 
Chief of MEDDLE without 
probing into MUDDLE’S 
business.” 

“Speaking of tractors,” an- 
other man put in, “we over at 
the Special Committee for Re- 
habilitation and Overhaul of 
Under-developed N a t i o n s’ 
General Economies have been 
trying for months to get a re- 
quest for mining equipment 
for d’Land through MED- 
DLE—” 

“SCROUNGE was late on 
the scene,” Whaffle said. 
“First come, first served. 
That’s our policy at MED- 
DLE. Good day, gentlemen.” 
He strode off, briefcase un- 
der his arm. 

“That’s the trouble with 
peaceful worlds,” the 
SCROUNGE committeeman 
said. “Boge is a trouble- 
maker, so every agency in the 
Corps is out to pacify her. 
While my chance to tnake a 
record— that is, assist peace- 
loving d’Land — comes to 
CULTURAL EXCHANGE 



naught.” He shook his head. 

“What kind of university 
do they have on d’Land ?” 
asked Retief. “We’re sending 
them two thousand exchange 
students. It must be quite an 
institution.” 

“University? D’Land has 
one under-endowed technical 
college.” 

“Will all the exchange stu- 
dents be studying at the Tech- 
nical College?” 

“Two thousand students? 
Hah! Two hundred students 
would overtax the facilities of 
the college.” 

“I wonder if the Bogans 
know that?” 

“The Bogans? Why, most 
of d’Land’s difficulties are 
due to the unwise trade 
agreement she entered into 
with Boge. Two thousand 
students indeed!” He snorted 
and walked away. 

R ETIEF stopped by the of- 
fice to pick up a short 
cape, then rode the elevator 
to the roof of the 230-story 
Corps HQ building and 
hailed a cab to the port. The 
Bogan students had arrived 
early. Retief saw them lined 
up on the ramp waiting to go 
through customs. It would be 
half an hour before they were 
cleared through. He turned 
into the bar and ordered a 
beer. 

A tall young fellow bn the 
next stool raised his glass. 
“Happy days,” he said. 
“And nights to match.” 
“You said it,” He gulped

half his beer. “My name’s 
Karsh. Mr. Karsh. Yep, Mr. 
Karsh. Boy, this is a drag, 
sitting around this place wait- 
mg. 

“You meeting somebody?” 
“Yeah. Bunch of babies. 
Kids. How they expect — 
Never mind. Have one on me.” 
“Thanks. You a Scoutmas- 
ter?” 

“I’ll tell you what I am. I’m 
a cradle-robber. You know — ” 
he turned to Retief — “not 
one of those kids is over 
eighteen.” He hiccupped. 
“Students, you know. Never 
saw a student with a beard, 
did you?” 

“Lots of times. You’re meet- 
ing the students, are you?” 
The young fellow blinked 
at Retief. “Oh, you know 
about it, huh?” 

“I represent MUDDLE.” 
Karsh finished his beer, or- 
dered another. “I came on 
ahead. Sort of an advance 
guard for the kids. I trained 
’em myself. Treated it like a 
game, but they can handle a 
CSU. Don’t know how they’ll 
act under pressure. If I had 
my old platoon — ” 

He looked at his beer glass, 
pushed it back. “Had enough,” 
he said. “So long, friend. Or 
are you coming along?” 

Retief nodded. “Might as 
well.” 

A T the exit to the Customs 
enclosure, Retief watched 
as the first of the Bogan 
students came through, caught 
sight of Karsh and snapped 



to attention, his chest out. 

“Drop that, mister,” Karsh 
snapped. “Is that any way for 
a student to act?” 

The youth, a round-faced 
lad with broad shoulders, 
grinned. 

“Heck, no,” he said. “Say, 
uh, Mr. Karsh, are we gonna 
get to go to town? We fellas 
were thinking — ” 

“You were, hah? You act 
like a bunch of school kids! 
I mean... no! Now line up!” 

“We have quarters ready 
for the students,” Retief said. 
“If you’d like to bring them 
around to the west side, I 
have a couple of copters laid 
on.” 

“Thank s,” said Karsh. 
“They’ll stay here until take- 
off time. Can’t have the little 
dears wandering around loose. 
Might get ideas about going 
over the hill.” He hiccupped. 
“I mean they might play 
hookey.” 

“We ve scheduled your re- 
embarkation for noon tomor- 
row. That’s a long wait. MUD- 
DLE’S arranged theater tick- 
ets and a dinner.” 

“Sorry,” Karsh said. “As 
soon as the baggage gets here, 
we’re off.” He hiccupped 
again. “Can’t travel without 
our baggage, y’know.” 

“Suit y o u r s e 1 f,” Retief 
said. “Where’s the baggage 
now?” 

“Coming in aboard a Croan- 
ie lighter.” 

“Maybe you’d like to ar- 
range for a meal for the stu- 
dents here.”

“Sure,” Karsh said. “That’s 
a good idea. Why don’t you 
join us?” Karsh winked. “And 
bring a few beers.” 

“Not this time,” Retief said. 
He watched the students, 
still emerging from Customs. 
“They seem to be all boys,” 
he commented. “No female 
students?” 

“Maybe later,” Karsh said. 
“You know, after we see how 
the first bunch is received.” 
Back at the MUDDLE of- 
fice, Retief buzzed Miss Fur- 
kle. 

“Do you know the name of 
the institution these Bogan 
students are bound for?” 
“Why, the University at 
d’Land, of cotirse.” 

“Would that be the Tech- 
nical College?” 

Miss Furkle’s mouth puck- 
ered. “I’m sure I’ve never 
pried into these details.” 
“Where does doing your 
job stop and prying begin, 
Miss Furkle?” Retief said. 
“Personally, I’m curious as to 
just what it is these students 
are travelling so far to study 
— at Corps expense.” 

“Mr. Magnan never — ” 

“For the present. Miss Fur- 
kle, Mr. Magnan is vacation- 
ing. That leaves me with the 
question of two thousand 
young male students headed 
for a world with no class- 
rooms for them. .a world in 
need of tractors. 'But the trac- 
tors are on their way to 
Croanie, a world under obli- 
gation to Boge. And Croanie 
holds a mortgage on the best 



grape acreage on Lovenbroy.” 
“Well!” Miss Furkle 
snapped, small eyes glaring 
under unplucked brows. “I 
hope you’re not questioning 
Mr. Magnan's wisdom!” 
“About Mr. Magnan’s wis- 
dom there can be no question,” 
Retief said. “But never mind. 
I’d like you to look up an 
item for me. How many trac- 
tors will Croanie be getting 
under the MEDDLE pro- 
gram?” 

“Why, that's entirely MED- 
DLE business,” Miss Furkle 
said. “Mr. Magnan always — ” 
“I’m sure he did. Let me 
know about the tractors as 
soon as you can.” 

M ISS Furkle sniffed and 
disappeared from the 
screen. Retief left the office, 
descended forty-one stories, 
followed a corridor to the 
Corps Library. In the stacks 
he thumbed through cata- 
logues, pored over indices. 

“Can I help you?” someone 
chirped. A tiny librarian 
stood at his elbow. 

“Thank you, ma’am,” Re- 
tief said. “I’m looking for in- 
formation on a mining rig. A 
Bolo model WV tractor.” 
“You won’t find it in the 
industrial section,” the librar- 
ian said. “Come along.” Retief 
followed her along the stacks 
to a well-lit section lettered 
ARMAMENTS. She took a 
tape from the shelf, plugged 
it into the viewer, flipped 
through and stopped at a 
squat armored vehicle.

“That’s the model WV,” she 
said. “It’s what is known as a 
continental siege unit. It car- 
ries four men, with a half- 
megaton/second firepower.” 
“There must be an error 
somewhere,” Retief said. “The 
Bolo model I want is a trac- 
tor. Model WV M-l — ” 

“Oh, the modification was 
the addition of a bulldozer 
blade for demolition work. 
That must be what confused 
you.” 

“Probably — among other 
things. Thank you.” 

Miss Furkle was waiting at 
the office. “I have the infor- 
mation you wanted,” she 
said. “I’ve had it for over ten 
minutes. I was under the im- 
pression you needed it ur- 
gently, and I went to great 
lengths — ” 

“Sure,” Retief said. “Shoot. 
How many tractors?” 

“Five hundred.” 

“Are you sure?” 

Miss Furkle’s chins quiv- 
ered. “Well! If you feel I'm 
incompetent — ” 

“Just questioning the pos- 
sibility of a mistake, Miss 
Furkle. Five hundred tractors 
is a lot of equipment.” 

“Was there anything fur- 
ther?” Miss Furkle inquired 
frigidly. 

“I sincerely hope not,” Re- 
tief said. 

Ill 

L EANING back in Magnan’s 
padded chair with power 
swivel and hipu-matic con- 



tour, Retief leafed through a 
folder labelled “CERP 7 - 602 - 
Ba; CROANIE (general).” 
He paused at a page headed 
Industry. 

Still reading, he opened the 
desk drawer, took out the two 
bottles of Bacchus wine and 
two glasses. He poured an 
inch of wine into each and 
sipped the black wine medi- 
tatively. 

It would be a pity, he re- 
flected, if anything should in- 
terfere with the production 
of such vintages . 

Half an hour later he laid 
the folder aside, keyed the 
phone and put through a call 
to the Croanie Legation. He 
asked for the Commercial At- 
tache. 

“Retief here, Corps HQ,” 
he said airily. “About the 
MEDDLE shipment, the 
tractors. I’m wondering if 
there’s been a slip up. My 
records show we’re shipping 
five hundred units. 

“That’s correct. Five hun- 
dred.” 

Retief waited. 

“Ah... are you there, Re- 
tief?” 

“I’m still here And I’m still 
wondering about the five hun- 
dred tractors.” 

“It’s perfectly in order. I 
thought if was all settled. Mr. 
Whaffle— ” 

“One unit would require a 
good-sized plant to handle its 
output,” Retief said. “Now 
Croanie subsists on her fish- 
eries. She has perhaps half a 
dozen pint-sized processing 



CULTURAL EXCHANGE 



117 




plants. Maybe, in a bind, they 
could handle the ore ten 
WV’s could scrape up... if 
Croanie had any ore. It 
doesn’t. By the way, isn’t a 
WV a poor choice, as a mining 
outfit? I should think — ” 

“See here, Retief! Why all 
this interest in a few surplus 
tractors? And in any event, 
what business is it of yours 
how we plan to use the equip- 
ment? That’s an internal af- 
fair of my government. Mr. 
W baffle — ” 

‘Tm not Mr. Whaffle. 
What are you going to do 
with the other four hundred 
and ninety tractors?” 

“I understood the grant was 
to be v/ith no strings at- 
tached !” 

“I know it’s bad manners to 
ask questions. It’s an old dip- 
lomatic tradition that any 
time you can get anybody to 
accept anything as a gift, 
you’ve scored points in the 
game. But if Croanie has 
some scheme cooking — ” 

{{jVTOTHING like that, Re- 
tief. It’s a mere business 
transaction.” 

“What kind of business do 
you do with a Bolo WV? 
With or without a blade at- 
tached, it’s what’s known as 
a continental siege unit.” 
“Great Heavens, Retief! 
Don’t jump to conclusions! 
Would you have us branded 
as warmongers? Frankly — is 
this a closed line?” 

“Certainly. You may speak 
freely.” 

110 



“The tractors are for trans- 
shipment. We’ve gotten our- 
selves into a difficult situa- 
tion, b a 1 a n c e-of-payments- 
wise. This is an accommoda- 
tion to a group with which 
we have rather -strong busi- 
ness ties.” 

“I understand you hold a 
mortgage on the best land on 
Lovenbroy,” Retief said. “Any 
connection?” 

“Why. .ah. .no. Of course 
not, ha ha.” 

“Who gets the tractors 
eventually?” 

“Retief, this is unwarranted 
interference !” 

“Who gets them?” 

“They happen to be going 
to Lovenbroy. But I scarcely 
see — ” 

“And who’s the friend 
you’re helping out with an un- 
authorized transshipment of 
grant material?” 

“Why... ah... I’ve been 
working with a Mr. Gulver, 
a Bogan representative.” 

“And when will they be 
shipped ?” 

“Why, they went out a 
week ago. They’ll be half way 
there by now. But look here, 
Retief, this isn’t what you’re 
thinking !” 

“How do you know what 
I’m thinking? I don’t know 
myself.” Retief rang off, 
buzzed the secretary. 

“Miss Furkle, I’d like to be 
notified immediately of any 
new applications that might 
come in from the Bogan Con- 
sulate for placement of stu- 
dents.”

“Well, it happens, by coin- 
cidence, that I have an appli- 
cation here now. Mr. Gulver 
of the Consulate brought it 
in.” 

“Is Mr. Gulver in the of- 
fice? I’d like to see him.” 

“I’ll ask him if he has 
time.” 

“Great. Thanks.” It was 
half a minute before a thick- 
necked red-faced man in a 
tight hat walked in. He wore 
an old-fashioned suit, a drab 
shirt, shiny shoes with round 
toes and an ill-tempered ex- 
pression. 

46YUTHAT is it you wish?” 
▼ ▼ he barked. “I under- 
stood in my discussions with 
the other. .ah . c i v i 1 i a n 
there’d be no further need for 
these irritating conferences.” 

“I’ve just learned you’re 
placing more students abroad, 
Mr. Gulver. How many this 
time?” 

“Two thousand.” 

“And where will they be 
going?” 

“Croanie. It’s all in the ap- 
plication form I’ve handed in. 
Your job is to provide trans- 
portation.” 

“Will there be any other 
students embarking this sea- 
son?” 

“Why .. .perhaps. That’s 
Boge’s b u s i n e s s.” Gulver 
looked at Retief with pursed 
lips. “As a matter of fact, we 
had in mind dispatching an- 
other two thousand to 
Featherweight.” 

“Another under-populated

world — and in the same clus- 
ter, I believe,” Retief said. 
“Your people must be unusu- 
ally interested in that region 
of space.” 

“If that’s all you wanted to 
know, I’ll be on my way. I 
have matters of importance to 
see to.” 

After Gulver left, Retief 
called Miss Furkle in. “I’d 
like to have a break-out of all 
the student movements that 
have been planned under the 
present program,” he said. 
“And see if you can get a 
summary of what MEDDLE 
has been shipping latefy.” 

M iss Furkle compressed 
her lips. “If Mr. Magnan 
were here, I’m sure he 
wouldn’t dream of interfer- 
ing in the work of other 
departments. I. .overheard 
your conversation with the 
gentleman from the Croanie 
Legation — ” 

“The lists, Miss Furkle.” 

“I’m not accustomed.” Miss 
Furkle said, “to intruding in 
matters outside our interest 
cluster.” 

“That’s worse than listen- 
ing in on phone conversations, 
eh? But never mind. I need 
the information, Miss 
Furkle.” 

“Loyalty to my Chief — ” 

“Loyalty to your pay-check 
should send you scuttling for 
the material I’ve asked for,” 
Retief said. “I’m taking full 
responsibility. 'Now scat.” 

The buzzer sounded. Retief 
flipped a key. “MUDDLE, 
Retief speaking...”

Arapoulous’s brown face 
appeared on the desk screen. 

'‘How-do, Retief. Okay if I 
come up?” 

“Sure, Hank. I want to talk 
to you.” 

In the office, Arapoulous 
took a chair. “Sorry if I’m 
rushing you, Retief,” he said. 
“But have you got anything 
for me?” 

Retief waved at the wine 
bottles. “What do you know 
about Croanie?” 

“Croanie? Not much of a 
place. Mostly ocean. All right 
if you like fish, I guess. We 
import our seafood from 
there. Nice prawns in mon- 
soon time. Over a foot long.” 

“You on good terms with 
them ?” 

“Sure, I guess so. Course, 
they’re pretty thick with 
Boge." 

“So?” 

“Didn’t I tell you? Boge 
was the bunch that tried to 
take us over here a dozen 
years back. They’d’ ve made it 
too, if they hadn’t had a lot 
of bad luck. Their armor went 
in the drink, and without ar- 
mor thev’re easy game.” 

M iss Furkle buzzed. “T 
have your lists,” she said 
shortly. 

“Bring them in, please.’’ 

nnHE secretary placed the 
papers on the desk. Ara- 
poulous caught her eye and 
grinned. She sniffed and 
marched from the room. 

“What that gal needs is a 
slippery time in the grape 

120 



mash,” Arapoulous observed 
Retief thumbed through the 
papers, pausing to read from 
time to time. He finished and 
looked at Arapoulous. 

“How many men do you 
need for the harvest, Hank?” 
Retief inquired. 

Arapoulous sniffed his 
wine glass and looked 
thoughtful. 

“A hundred would help,” 
he said. “A thousand would 
be better. Cheers.” 

“What would you say to 
two thousand?” 

“Two thousand? Retief, 
you’re not fooling?” 

“I hope not.” He picked up 
the phone, called the Port 
Authority, asked for the dis- 
patch clerk. 

“Hello, Jim. Say, I have a 
favor to ask of you. You 
know that contingent of Bo- 
gan students. They’re travel- 
ing aboard the two CDT 
transports. I’m interested in 
the baggage that goes with 
the students Has it arrived 
yet? Okay, I’ll wait.” 

Jim came back to the 
phone. “Yeah, Retief, it’s 
here. Just arrived. But there’s 
a funny thing. It’s not con- 
signed to d’Land. It’s ticket- 
ed clear through to Loven- 
broy.” 

“Listen, Jim,” Retief said. 
“I want you to go over to the 
warehouse and take a look at 
that baggage for me.” 

Retief waited while the dis- 
patch clerk carried out the 
errand. The level in the two 
bottles had gone down an

inch when Jim returned to 
the phone. 

“Hey, I took a look at that 
baggage, Retief. Something 
funny going on. Guns. 2mm 
needlers, Mark XII hand 
blasters, power pistols — ” 

“It’s okay, Jim. Nothing to 
worry about. Just a mix-up. 
Now, Jim, I’m going to ask 
you to do something more for 
me. I’m covering for a friend. 
It seems he slipped up. I 
wouldn’t want word to get 
out, you understand. I’ll send 
along a written change order 
in the morning that will cov- 
er you officially. Meanwhile, 
here’s what I want you to 
do...” 

Retief gave instructions, 
then rang off and turned to 
Arapoulous. 

“As soon as I get off a cou- 
ple of TWX’s, I think we’d 
better get down to the port, 
Hank. I think I’d like to see 
the students off personally.”

K ARSH met Retief as he 
entered the Departures 
enclosure at the port. 

“What’s going on here?” he 
demanded. “There’s some fun- 
ny business with my baggage 
consignment. They won’t let 
me see Itl I’ve got a feeling 
it’s not being loaded.” 

"You'd better hurry, Mr* 
Karsh , 3 n Retief said- ^You’re 
scheduled to Mast off in less 
than an hour. Are the stu- 
dents all loaded!” 

"Yes, blast you! What

about my baggage? Those 
vessels aren’t moving without 
it !” 

“No need to get so upset 
about a few toothbrushes, is 
there, Mr. Karsh?” Retief 
said blandly. “Still, if you’re 
worried — ” He turned to Ara- 
poulous. 

“Hank, why don’t you walk 
Mr. Karsh over to the ware- 
house and . .ah. .take care of 
him?” 

“I know just how to handle 
it,” Arapoulous said. 

The dispatch clerk came up 
to Retief. “I caught the trac- 
tor equip m e n t,” he said. 
“Funny kind of mistake, but 
it’s okay now. They’re being 
off-loaded at d’Land. I talked 
to the traffic controller there. 
He said they weren’t looking 
for any students.” 

“The labels got switched, 
Jim. The students go where 
the baggage was consigned. 
Too bad about the mistake, 
but the Armaments Office 
will have a man along in a lit- 
tle while to dispose of the 
guns. Keep an eye out for the 
luggage. No telling where it’s 
gotten to.” 

“Here !” a hoarse voice 
yelled. Retief turned. A di- 
sheveled figure in a tight hat 
was crossing the enclosure, 
arms waving. 

“Hi there, Mr. Gulver,” Re- 
tief called. “How’s Boge’s 
business coming along?” 

“Piracy 1” Gulver blurted 
as he came up to Retief, puff- 
ing hard. “You’ve got a hand 
In this, I don’t doubt!

Where’s that Magnan fel- 
low?” 

“What seems to be the 
problem?” Retief said. 

“Hold those transports ! 
I’ve just been notified that 
the baggage shipment has 
been impounded. I’ll remind 
you, that shipment enjoys 
diplomatic free entry!” 

“Who told you it was im- 
pounded?” 

“Never mind! I have my 
sources !” 

Two tall men buttoned into 
gray tunics came up. “Are 
you Mr. Retief of CDT?” one 
said. 

“That’s right.” 

“What about my baggage!” 
Culver cut in. “And I’m warn- 
ing you, if those ships lift 
without — ” 

“These gentlemen are from 
the Armaments Control Com- 
mission,” Retief said. “Would 
you like to come a 1 'mg and 
claim your baggage, Mr. Qui- 
ver ?’’ 

“From where? I — ” Gulver 
turned two shades redder 
about the ears. “A.rnwm *ots?” 

“The only shipment I’ve 
held up seems to be some- 
body’s arsenal,” Relief said. 
“Now if you cla 5 m this is

“Why, impossible,” Gul-

“No, of course not,” he said 
dully. “Not my baggage. Not 
my baggage at all.” 

Arapoulous appeared, sup- 
porting the stumbling figure 
of Mr. Karsh. 

“What — what’s this?” Gul- 
ver spluttered. “Karsh? 
What’s haopened?” 

“He had a little fall. He’ll 
be okay,” Arapoulous said. 

“You’d better help him to 
the ship,” Retief said. “It’s 
ready to lift. We wouldn’t 
want him to miss it.” 

“Leave him to me!" Gulver 
snapped, his eyes slashing at 
Karsh. “I’ll see he’s dealt 
with.” 

“I couldn’t think of it,” Re- 
tief said. “He’s a guest of the 
Corps, you know. We’ll see 
him safely aboard.” 

Gulver turned, signaled 
frantically. Three heavy-set 
men in identical drab suits 
detached themselves from the 
wall, crossed to the group. 

“Take this man,” Gulver 
snapped, indicating Karsh, 
who looked at him dazedly, 
reached up to rub his head. 

“We take our hospitality 
seriously,” Retief said. “We’ll 
see him aboard the vessel.” 
Gulver opened his mouth. 
“I know you feel bad about 
finding guns instead of 
school books in your lug- 
gage,” Retief said, looking 
Gulver in the eye. “You’ll be 
busy straightening oirt the 
details of the mix-up. You’ll 
want to avoid further compli- 
cations.” 

“Ah. Ulp. Yes,” Gulver

said. He appeared unhappy. 

Arapoulous went on to the 
passenger conveyor, turned to 
wave. 

“Your man — he’s g o i n g 
too? M Gulver blurted. 

“He’s not our man, proper- 
ly speaking/’ Retief said. “He 
lives on Lovenbroy.” 

“Lovenbroy?” Gulver 
choked. “But. .the. I ../ 9 
“I know you said the stu- 
dents were bound for 
d’Land,” Retief said. “But I 
guess that was just another 
aspect of the general confu- 
sion. The course plugged into 
the navigators was to Loven- 
broy. You’ll be glad to know 
they’re still headed there — 
even without the baggage.” 

“P e r h a p s,” Gulver said 
grimly, “perhaps they’ll man- 
age without it.” 

“By the way,” Retief said. 
“There was another funny 
mix-up. There were some 
tractors — for industrial use, 
you’ll recall. I believe you co- 
operated with Croanie in ar- 
ranging the grant through 
MEDDLE. They were errone- 
ously consigned to Loven- 
broy, a purely agricultural 
world. I saved you some em- 
barrassment, I trust, Mr. Gul- 
ver, by arranging to have 
them offloaded at d’Land.” 
“D’Land! You’ve put the 
CSU’s in the hands of Boge’s 
bitterest enemies!” 

“But they’re only tractors, 
Mr. Gulver. Peaceful devices. 
Isn’t that correct?” 

“That’s. .correct.” Gulver 
sagged. Then he snapped

yelled. “I’m canceling ths

His voice was drowned by 
the rumble as the first of the 
monster transports rose from 
the launch pit, followed a mo- 
ment later by the second, Re- 
tief watched them out of 
sight, then turned to Gulver. 

“They’re off,” he said. 
“Let’s hope they get a liberal 
education.”

R ETIEF lay on his back in 
deep grass by a stream, 
eating grapes. A tall figure 
appeared on the knoll above 
him and waved. 

“Retief!” Hank Arapoulous 
bounded down the slope and 
embraced Retief, slapping 
him on the back. “I heard you 
were here — and I’ve got news 
for you. You won the final 
day’s picking competition. 
Over two hundred bushels! 
That’s a record !” 

“Let’s get on over to the 
garden. Sounds like the cele- 
bration’s about to start.” 

In the flower-crowded park 
among the stripped vines, Re- 
tief and Arapoulous made 
their way to a laden table un- 
der the lanterns. A tall girl 
dressed in loose white, and 
with long golden hair, came 
up to Arapoulous. 

“Delinda, this is Retief — 
today’s winner. And he’s also 
the fellow that got those 
workers for us.” 

Delinda smiled at Retief.

HUE 

AND 

CRY 



The place where readers 
and editor meet . 



Dear Editor: 

Just read Jots and Tittles. 
You’re one up on me — I don’t 
even know what a jot is. Hav- 
ing just come into reposses- 
sion of part of my 1952-53 col- 
lection of SF magazines (8c 
having proceeded to plow into 
them voraciously) I am in a 
better position than the aver- 
age younger reader to under- 
stand the change that has 
taken place. And I can under- 
stand why no one wants a let- 
ter column any more. Simply 
— what for? To read that Joe 
Blow, Irma Grinkle and Icha- 
bod Schmerdlikov all think 
you publish a pretty good 
magazine? Who needs it? 
This is Hue 8c Cry? No, this 
is plain old-fashioned egoboo, 
interesting to you but not to 
the readers. If that’s all that’s 
in the mailbag, then best lay 
Hue 8c Cry to rest. 



However — now we push up 
our sleeves and go to work — I 
gather that you’d rather resur- 
rect the body. Well, come to 
think of it, I can’t tell you 
how to do that, but I can tell 
you what I think is killing 
it /him her. 

1. Lame or pedantic edito- 
rials. No, yours wasn’t this 
issue. And yes, I realize how 
difficult it becomes month 
after month. I’m sure you 
read all the other SF maga- 
zines. How many editorials 
are an end in themselves? 
They pick (or should I say 
pick on?) a subject and then 
talk it to death. By the time 
the editor has finished it, it’s 
a complete classroom lecture, 
with no need for a question- 
and-answer period. Or how 
many editorial* piddle 
through a page or so while the 
editor mealy-mouths a few 





trite comments on this 
month’s issue? A good healthy 
percentage of the letters in 
the lettercols of the ’'good old 
days” dealt with the “bright, 
sparkling” (your words, not 
mine) editorials. 

2. Indifferent answers to 
letters. Yes, some of yours fall 
into this category. Ain’t no- 
body can answer a fan like 
Ray Palmer and Sam — Mines 
or Merwin? I’d have to look 
it up. Anyway, they didn’t 
pass the buck. And they 
weren’t above telling some nut 
to go soak his head in for- 
maldehyde. Which brings us 
to 

3 . Your gray hairs are show- 
ing. Dad. Ten to twenty years 
ago you were all roughly in 
the same age bracket. A twen- 
ty-year-old fan could write to 
a twenty-five-year-old editor 
as he would to an old pal. No 
worries about whether the let- 
ters sounded immature. “This 
Is my old buddy, Joe. I’m gon- 
na tell him that story stank. 
His judgment was way off on 
that one.” Now Dad, where 
are we going to dig up a kid 
who’ll tell F*R*E*D*jE*R*- 
l*K P*0*H*L ! ! ! that his 
judgment was off and he 
should go soak his head? No- 
body’s gonna take a poke at 
dear old Dad while he’s sittin’ 
on the porch in his rockin’ 
chair. 

All right, all right, cease 
and desist, Dad. I can see 
you've risen from the chair; 
sow come down off the porch 
and take a poke at me. Don’t 
look to the other youngsters 



for help. Can you take it, 
Dad? You can call me names, 
too. But the one I like best 
is —

Dear Editor: 

Ho, “bright sparkling let- 
ters” the man wants. But 
DearMisterEditorSir, it’s been 
so long since we’ve had a 
chance to sparkle and we’re 
so badly out of practice. Part 
of the trouble is that while 
the editors have not minded 
when the readers sharpened 
their wits against one another 
they took a certain degree of 
exception to having the men- 
tal fang of said readers whet* 
ted against their magazines. 
Does this mean that the hum- 
ble reader can occasionally 
wittily pan some portion of 
your magazine and have his 
golden words see the light of 
day? If so, the good ol’ days 
may well return again.

Dear Editor: 

I’m afraid I have nothing 
but compliments for you this 
month, but I keep telling my- 
self that they can’t keep up 
the good work at Digest 
Publications much longer. Old 
Fred will slip sometime, and 
then I’ll be able to lower the 
boom. Really your stories get 
better all the time and won- 
der-wise you’ve got them all 
beat. You’ve recaptured some 
of the spirit of good ol’ Plan- 
et, and that is surely quite a 
feat. (You have even got them 
beaten in one respect: Your 
illos are even worse than 
theirs used to be.) 

Oh, incidentally, why don’t 



you print street addresses in 
H&C? 

Guess I’ll sign off with a

Dear Editor: 

Where are the new authors, 
you ask. Let me tell you. 

One of the fan clubs ran a 
fiction contest for amateurs 
this year. Cash prizes, almost 
a hundred bucks. (Some of us 
care enough about stf to put 
up our own money to improve 
the state of the art.) 

There were fifty entries, 
mostly from organized fan- 
dom. Here is what happened: 

About half trapped in the 
dead end of short-shorts with 
surprise endings. Seventy per 
cent don’t know what a story 
is. (Specifically: An incident 
is not a story, neither is a 
series of incidents without 
continuity between them.) 
Some could write character- 
ization (I recall with gusto 



and glee a 14-year-old girl 
who did it with dialogue), but 
what good are characters with- 
out a story? Some have a rare 
gift for communicating mood 
and feelings, but all too often 
overdo it, as though they had 
just discovered the dictionary. 

In simple words, then, they 
fall prey to all the problems 
of beginning authors. They 
can do part of it, but not all. 

A dead loss? Don’t be silly, 
there were about ten that 
came out, by the scoring sys- 
tem used, as “the type written 
by an amateur close to selling, 
or by a pro who bangs out a 
dud under the influence of a 
hangover.” A flaw or two, but 
not too many. 

There were more, four of 
them in fact (in my own not 
so modest opinion as prelim- 
inary judge — punishment for 
thinking of the idea) which 
came pretty close to this 
month’s issue of //, except for 
Leiber, of course. But, and a 
Jupiter size “but” it is, too, 
two were less than 1,000 
words, and who buys those un- 
less the author’s name is Fred 
Brown? 

Conclusions? You bet, and 
this is likely to cause a shriek 
of agony from the hard-heart- 
ed editor. A question: If a 
new writer is overjoyed at 
comment and criticism from 
just another amateur, what 
wouldn’t they give for a few 
words from an editor scrib- 
bled on the back of the rejec- 
tion slip?

Ah, what a dream. You 
could gain a place in the ama- 
teur writers’ hall of fame for 
the price of this little time. 
(“Time? What’s that?” he 
says with a sigh.) Just tell 
them a little direction, and 
yo might find all sorts of new 
writers. Alas, what a job, 
finding tame pro to do this 
for you. Will you shed a tear?

*We do buy stories from 
fans — there are around a doz- 
en in inventory right now. We 
do buy stories under 1,000 
words — and not only from 
Fred Brown — provided they 
are stories. (That’s hard to 
do.) And we can*t write per- 
sonal notes with all, or even 
very many, rejected manu- 
scripts. It isn’t really because 
we’re hard-hearted, or lazy 
either. Figure it out ypurself. 
We get something around 
4,000 manuscripts a year. Mul- 
tiply that by, say, 10 minutes 
each — or whatever you think 
would be necessary to write a 
note on each one. (And we’ll 
let you in on a little secret: 
It is not merely the time spent 
to write one note, but the time 
spent on the follow-up cor- 
respondence that inevitably 
results, that really begins to 
hurt.) 

Still, there’s something in 
what you say, and you’ve giv- 
en us an idea. Starting now,'// 
is going to make it a point to 
publish at least one first story 
in each issue. How long we ! ll 



keep it up is up to you; at 
least a year or so, we hope 
forever. This isn’t a contest; 
no prizes; no entry blanks; 
they’ll be considered just as 
any other story is considered 
and paid for in the same way. 
But — this month we present 
the first sale made by Joseph 
Green, Once Around Arctur - 
us. (He has made several 
since, by the way.) Next issue,

next.

the same problem, see the next

Dear Editor: 

With that editorial you 
threw your readers quite a 
curve. The trouble is, the en- 
tire problem is more than the 
prevention of the war and/or 
its possibility. The problem 
fully stated has two factors: 
how can we prevent a war of 
the greatest magnitude? 

I imagine you’ll get a num- 
ber of Answers based on the 
solution of the first factor, 
the prevention of the war. But 
it is not the nature of the 
human race to fit itself into 
any one set of characteristics, 
and for this reason you can’t 
eliminate war or the possibili- 
ty of war. Nor can you expect 
men to use less than their 
most potent weapons. 

Accepting this as so, we 
will consider the second fac- 
tor. What do I mean by mag- 
nitudes of disaster? Well, 
assume that you are a starv- 
ing man. If you have only one 
egg and lose it, you’ll die, but 
if you have two eggs and lose 
one, you’ll still live. In both 
cases the disaster is the same; 
the loss of an egg. The deci- 
sive and only difference lies 
in the per cent of the whole 
the loss represents. The mag- 
nitude of disaster depends 
upon the per cent of the 
whole lost; a greater per cent 
means a greater magnitude, a 
lesser per cent, a lesser mag- 
nitude. 

All this can be applied to 
worlds. If Earth is destroyed 



while it is the only home of 
mankind, it is the End. Its 
destruction becomes an event 
of much less magnitude when 
it is only one of many human 
inhabited worlds. Through 
the conquest of space we will 
soon be making our mark on 
other planets and when we do 
we’ll be solving the problem. 
In less years than you have 
fingers we will no longer have 
to worry about total destruc- 
tion. 

Keeping in mind the idea 
that we will not be able to 
prevent war, the conquest of 
space gives us further oppor- 
tunity to deduce its magni- 
tude beyond providing us 
with more eggs. When (not 
if) the next war is fought it 
may be good strategic and 
tactical policy to do most of 
the fighting in space, for I am 
fairly certain that no planet 
can stand a determined attack 
from space. One's best 
chances for defense will lie in 
stopping the enemy before 
they arrive. Moreover, a space 
fleet should be able to mini- 
mize the amount of devasta- 
tion a nation can perpetrate 
on another of the same planet. 

All in all, now’ that we’re 
shopping for Answers, I think 
the conquest of space is our 
best, if not our only, buy. Be- 
sides, we don’t even have to 
sell anybody — it’s already be- 
ing carried out!
