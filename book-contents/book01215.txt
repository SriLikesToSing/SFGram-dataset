ABOUT OUR CONTRIBUTORS 



A. E. Van Vogt is no stranger to long-time science fiction fans. The 
author of such classics as The World of Null A, Sian and Voyage of the 
Space Beagle, Van Vogt’s interest in 21st Century psychologies and 
philosophies is legendary. His new novel from Pocket Books (a portion of 
which is previewed in this issue as Femworld: Before the Revolution) 
touches on zoological observations of the behavior of “rogue males’’ in 
society and how they might react with some of the more extreme elements 
of the women’s liberation movement who see male aggression as the root 
cause of most of history’s evils. 

Jane Gallion, author of this month’s headliner, Beneath the Bermuda 
Triangle, has a distinguished literary reputation outside the Held for such 
works as Stoned and The Woman As Nigger, but cut her teeth on science 
fiction. Her only published SF novel to date. Biker, is a collector’s item 
selling for $50 and more at conventions. 

Jesse Peel’s first sale was to GALAXY. Since then he has gone on to 
become a major contributor to our sister magazine lASFM. Known for a 
more serious, philosophical approach, his Star Warriors marks a radical 
departure for him and a return to the kind of fast-paced, super-charged, 
high-voltage science fiction entertairunent readers have been asking for. A 
Kung-fu instructor and former medical technician, Mr. Peel lives in Ore- 
gon, where he devotes his full time to writing and is currently working on 
his fu'st SF novel. 

Peter Martin is no new-comer either. His first SF story appeared all the 
way back in the old Vertex magazine. Once a member of the infamous 
West Coast Science Fiction Writer crowd, he now resides in the quieter 
reaches of West Virginia. The Psychic, his debut in GALAXY, begins 
a series of novelettes that will be appearing here over the next few issues. 

David Bunch’s “Moderan’’ stories have been appearing off and on in 
science fiction magazines for over a decade and a half. In that time 
they’ve developed a cult following like the stories of Professor Cordwainer 
Smith. Like his, they deal with a single continuing backdrop against which 
exotic activities happen. 

Frederik Pohl, of course, needs no introduction to these pages. A former 
editor of this magazine, he was also one of its earliest and most brilliant 
contributors. It is fitting that Jew, perhaps his greatest book, should be 
serialized here. A prolific and unusually well-informed SF writer, his 
career has spanned the whole history of modem science fiction. The author 
of The Space Merchants (a classic satire on the advertising controlled 
world of the future). Drunkard's Walk, and Stargate, his current autobiog- 
raphy, On The Way To The Future, is a runaway best seller. 

Ed Ludwig’s subtle blend of SF has been appearing in magazines like 
Amazing, F&SF, IF and GALAXY for over 20 years.

GALAXY 





Hank Stine 

EDITORIAL 



If you’re a new reader, welcome 
aboard! 

If you’re an old reader, welcome 
back! 

I mention the foregoing because 
with this issue GALAXY, one of 
the longest established science fic- 
tion magazines, begins to make ag- 
gressive new editorial and format 
changes in an attempt to reach the 
large market of readers, now in- 
terested in SF, who do not normally 
purchase magazines. 

At the same time, in response to 
letters from loyal followers who 
have been with GALAXY through- 
out the years, we are making 
equally aggressive changes designed 
to bring back the “golden days’’ of 
GALAXY artwork and story. 



Many of my ideas of what both 
kinds of readers want were picked 
up at the World Science Fiction 
Convention in Phoenix, from which 
I recently returned. 

It was a spectacular, week-long 
affair, and every bit up to one’s vi- 
sions of what a World Science Fic- 
tion Convention ought to be. 

Held in an utterly futuristic 
environment, in the deserted 
downtown of a modernistic city, it 
was a gathering of fans and pros 
that brought everyone together as 
equals in their love of science fic- 
tion for talk, discussion and, occas- 
sionally, mutual rancor. 

And speaking of the latter, yes, 
Harlan Ellison was there. 

For those of you who might not 
know, Harlan, one of our greatest 
living science fiction writers, found 
himself in what he felt was a dif- 
ficult position over his Guest of 
Honorship at the WorldCon. 

A man of conscience who came 
to support the ERA after much 
soul-searching, Harlan had agreed 
to GoH prior to the ERA economic 
boycott of Arizona (a state which 
has not yet ratified the ERA 
amendment). 

Wishing neither to break the 
boycott nor shortchange the conven- 
tion, Harlan took a difficult step 
which placed the burden directly on 
himself. 

Rather than spend, or have the 
convention spend in his name, 
money inside Arizona, Harlan 
stayed in a camper in 115 degree 
(continued on pg. 80)

VARRIORT 

By Jesse Peele 





I 

The fabric of reality shivered 
and shimmered blackly, as the 
silver-blue-and-gleaming disc that 
was the starship Starbird warped 
back into normal space from 
hyperdrive. Inside the ship. Dal 
Hamsun touched a heat-sensitive 
control tab, and the viewer screens 
blossomed into electronic life. 

Under full magnification, the 
green-and-blue world of Cynthia 

STAR WARRIORS 



Dianne misted quickly into focus, 
only a few million kilometers away. 

“Nice and peaceful looking, isn’t 
it?” Dal said to Lincheni, who was 
seated next to him. 

Lincheni the Demi-Whelf started 
to nod his funy head, wolf-like 
jowls flapping in agreement, when 
the screens flared into blinding- 
white light and went black! 

“Son-of-a-bitch!” Dal roared. 
All he could see was blue; two 
throbbing after-images left by the 

7 




strobed-out screens. Suddenly he 
heard a sharp crackle from the con- 
trol board, and then he smelled the 
acrid tang of burned insulation. 

“Damn! What the hell — ?” 

“We’re under attack!” Lincheni 
said. “AiTd we just blew one of the 
tertiary reactor circuits!” 

The human’s vision began to 
clear just as Lincheni managed to 
kick in the secondary back-up view- 
ing system — but there was nothing 
out there except the planet! 

“Tulak! What’s on the detec- 
tors?” 

From deep in the ship, a series of 
musical tones thrummed up and 
down the scale as Tulak, the giant 
Trogian robot sang his reply into 
the com. 

“Tulak says — ” Lincheni began. 

“I heard, I heard! Don’t just sit 
there! Have the computer put the 
ceepees onto the bastard and bum 
his ass. ” 

“You mean ‘them’. I’ve got the 
attackers on visual.” 

Dal looked at the screen, and felt 
the sweat running down the crease 
in his muscular spine. Six, seven, 
nine — no — twelve ships! The 
burned smell seemed to grow 
stronger — or was that his own fear? 
He slipped his fingers into the giant 
half-gloves that were the pilot’s 
controls, and began tapping various 
fingers lightly upon the surfaces. 
The sensitive plastic felt cold and 
unyielding, but he knew the ship 
was responding. He put her into a 
bone-wrenching turn, and started to 
stroke the computer in for evasive 
running — 

Then the damned gravity began 
to fade! Dal could feel himself 
growing lighter, and he began to 

8 



float away from the controls. His 
mouth became very, very dry. 
Twelve ships! They’d never be able 
to make it into hyper in time — ! 

“Tulak. Do something.’’ 

Another series of musical notes 
bleeped over the com. Good! The 
robot had the gravity working 
again. Dal could feel himself start 
to drift back toward the controls. 
Next time, he’d keep himself strap- 
ped in! 

“The shit’s hit it now, gang!” 
Dal yelled. “Tulak, what’s the best 
way out of this mess?” 

Lincheni ’s hairy paws were busy 
running over his own controls, but 
his Trogian was better than Dal’s. 
“Tulak says there isn’t any — !” 

“I heard!” Dal looked at the 
screens again. Twelve fucking ships. 
Why? This was a neutral world — 
out of the way — they weren’t even 
wanted in this sector! 

Lincheni had finally gotten the 
charged-particle cannons — the 

ceepees — operating. The computer 
did the actual aiming and firing, 
being much faster and more accu- 
rate, but it took a formal command 
to initiate the sequence. 

“Lin, how are we doing?” 

Lincheni turned for a second to 
stare at Dal with hooded yellow 
eyes. “Against twelve ships? We’ve 
got less chance than a snowball in a 
supernova!” 

“Tulak, you iron birdbrain! Can 
we outrun — ?” 

“Deedle dum.” Uh uh. No. 
Negative. 

Cal’s mind whirled. The sweat 
had spread from his back to his face 
and hands. He could not only smell 
the burned insulation, but the sour 
perspiration of the demi-whelf sit- 

GALAXY 




ting next to him. There were twelve 
ships latched onto his tail; they 
couldn’t outrun ’em and couldn’t 
outfight ’em. There was only one 
thing to do. 

“Stand by! I’m going to bring 
her about! We’ll head for the 
planet!’’ 

“You’re crazy!’’ Lincheni 
rasped. 

“You two got any better ideas?’’ 

“Uh ....’’ Lincheni began. 

“Negative,” Tulak intoned. 

“Listen! We’ll go for an end run, 
then cut back through the middle of 
the formation! Tulak, give us all the 
juice you can — hit the red line if 
you have to! If we can get into the 
middle of ’em, they won’t be able 
to shoot without hitting each 
other!” 

Lincheni muttered something 
about the insanity of terrans, but his 
six-fmgered paws kept flying over 
his controls. 

Deep in the hub of the control 
center, Tulak the robot said nothing; 
he merely carried out his functions 
with mechanical precision, his mas- 
sive limbs moving impossibly fast 
for such a large being. 

The pit of Dal’s stomach seemed 
to be full of something alive and 
roiling around, and his sweat cov- 
ered him like a tepid bath. He was 
both hot and cold, and there was a 
bitter, metallic taste on his tongue. 
As he watched, the dots of the 
enemy ships on the screen grew 
larger. He began praying to every 
god he’d ever heard of in his brief 
twenty-three years. He alternated 
between that and cursing, in every 
language he’d picked up on thirty- 
five worlds. 

The ship shook, with a slapping, 



gonging noise, as the enemy ships 
found the Starbird with their parti- 
cle cannons. So far, the shields had 
held — but Dal didn’t know how 
many more shots they could take. 
The air was growing warmer, a bad 
sign, and the smell of death- 
impending was thick in his nostrils. 

He remembered what it had been 
like during his first battle, during 
the bloody and terrible war, be- 
tween the mighty Omicron and 
Delta Systems. Of course, that had 
been nearly six years ago, a long 
time — he’d only been seventeen! 
But it was all coming back in too- 
vivid detail, now. He’d only been a 
gunnery crewman, then, not running 
his own ship, but the feeling was 
the same! The trapped feeling of 
doom. 

“Tulak! It’s yours! Put us into a 
hard parabola straight at the center 
ship in the formation. Lin, put all 
the ceepees onto that ship. And 
hang on!” 

Dal felt the gravity increase, and 
the centrifugal force pull his body 
hard, harder, incredibly harder into 
the seat as Tulak took control and 
brought the ship around. His body 
sagged, his cheeks drooped, his 
lower teeth seemed to stick out in a 
grimace, and his arms felt bonded 
to the couch. It was up to Tulak, 
now. Only the giant robot had the 
strength to run the controls — both 
Dal and Lincheni were too mashed 
down to move. 

Suddenly the center ship flared 
on the screen in an angry, red- 
orange flash that sent the vessel 
bursting in all directions. The Star- 
bird’s deadly green streauns of 
charged-particles had done it! 

“A . hit!” Dal moaned 



STAR WARRIORS

through his thick tongue and 
stretched lips! 

“Eleven vessels remain,” came 
Tulak’s sing-song over the com into 
Dal’s pressure-stretched ears. 

“Thanks . a . lot!” he 
groaned, jaw sagging with the effort 
of speech. • 

“Go ... for ... the .. hole. 
He was on the edge of blacking out. 

“Affirmative,” Tulak sang. 

The ships expanded, to fill the 
screen, until Dal could see the iden- 
tification numbers gleaming at him, 
until nothing else but ships, ev- 
erywhere ships! were visible — 

And they were through! 

The pressure began to ease as the 
curved path straightened somewhat. 
The acceleration couch hummed and 
massaged at Dal’s aching muscles, 
and he found he could breathe and 
even move his bone-weary arms. 

“Haha ha! We made it! Figure 
out an orbit that will slingshot us 
around the planet, and I’ll get us 
into hyper as soon as we clear!” 

Dal glanced up at his comp- 
screen digital read-out. “Those 
elbow-suckers will be eating hydro- 
gen exhaust in a few minutes!” 

“Maybe.” Lincheni said. He 
nodded toward one of the rear view 
screens, pointing with his long, 
black nose. 

One of the attacking ships had 
managed to pull away, somehow, 
and was pulling a narrow loop 
around to follow the Starbird. 

“One lousy ship!” Dal said, 
sneering. “A Henry-Class cruiser. 
We can chop that dung-eater up into 
a million — ” 

“And give the others time to 
catch up?” 

Dal glared at Lin. “You’re a pain 



sometimes, you know?” He ground 
his teeth together so hard he could 
not only feel the pressure, he could 
hear the permaplastic fillings 
squeak. And the metallic taste 
hadn’t gone away yet, either. 
“Crap, crap, crap!” 

He tongued the comswitch. 
“Tulak, can we outrun that bas- 
tard?” 

“Possibly. ” 

“Possibly? What the hell does 
that mean?” 

“The ship itself is only slightly 
faster,” he sang, “so in theory, we 
can outrun it. ” 

The air-conditioners seemed to be 
working again, and Dal felt a 
breeze begin to chill him where it 
touched his face and neck. “Go on, 
what’s the rest of it?” 

“We will, however, come within 
range of the pursuing ship’s 
weaponry before we achieve orbit, 
should he decide to fire upon us. ” 
Should he decide to. ? Dal 
knew damned well he’d decide to 
fire! 

“How can we slow him down?” 
“The only practical method for 
slowing the pursuer would be to 
seed proximity mines.” 

“Well, don’t just sit there, Lin, 
you heard Tulak — ! ’ ’ 

“Uh, Dal, we . uh used the 
last of the mines while running 
from the cyfy’con ships near 
Rizonuh last month.” 

“Damn!” Damn, damn, damn! 
“Well, I suppose we’ll just have 
to — ^^! ’ ’ 

liiere was a thundering roar, and 
the Starbird shook, as if swatted by 
a giant hand. Blue and red sparks 
jumped from the control panels, and 
Dal felt an electric shock from the 



10 



GALAXY 




glove controls. He jerked his hands 
away, and the control pit filled sud- 
denly with acrid, blue-gray smoke, 
swirling up from the mined controls 
in a vile-smelling fog. Emergency 
sirens howled, and automatic fire- 
fighting units were triggered. The 
hiss of foam as it squeezed from 
cracks in the micro-circuit boards 
joined the other babble of sound. 

“Tulak!” 

“We’ve taken a direct hit on the 
main drive unit,” the robot chimed, 
as if talking of the weather. “The 
hyper shifters are gone, most of the 
normal space engines are destroyed, 
and the ship is now on emergency 
back-up system Three.” 

“Three?” 

“Three.” 

Oh shit! Dai’s gut wanted to 
erupt, his heart seemed to be trying 
to knock a hole in his ribs! Three 
was the last back up system — it had 
barely enough power to do any- 
thing! 

His tongue scrabbled for the 
comswitch. “Can you get us 
down — to planet-side?” 

There was a pause, only a few 
seconds, but it seemed forever. 
“Tulak!” 

“I am unable to calculate that 
with any reasonable degree of — ” 

“Never mind! Try” 

“Affirmative. ” 

The ship skewed crazily, and Dal 
waved his hands uselessly in front 
of his face, trying to clear the cloak 
of choking, blinding smoke. Next to 
him, he could hear Lincheni curs- 
ing, mostly in fluent demi-whelf. 
but throwing in Interspeak and 
Saxlo occasionally for emphasis. 

They began a spiral toward the 
planet, a lurching, bouncing. 




stomach-turning path. There weren’t 
any more explosions, and Dal didn't 
wonder why — the cmiser expected 
them to go up like a meteorite when 
they hit the atmosphere! 

The Starhird began to pick up the 
outer edges of the planet’s air, and 
Dal could hear the screams of the 
heat-shields. The control pit began 
to get hot, until breathing burned 
his nostrils, dried his lungs. 

The smoke had cleared some- 
what, and he could see the forward 
viewers were still working — 
something of a minor miracle! Only 
he didn't like what he saw. The sur- 
face of the planet was coming up 
fast, much tix) fast! Even if the 
shields held, they’d probably hit the 
ground so fast they’d dig a hole a 
couple of kilometers deep. Or be 
splattered over ten kilometers in a 
large number of very small pieces!

It was up to Tulak! He’d pulled 
them out of some hairy situations 
before. 

The centrifugal force built up, as 
somehow, Tul^ managed a ragged 
curve, using the dying engines to 
their fullest. 3ut the pressure was 
too much for Dal, and he didn’t 
even have time to tell his friends 
good-bye before he blacked 
out. 

II 

Dal didn’t exactly wake' up — he 
sort of fell up. The ship was tilted 
at a crazy angle, and he’d been 
crammed against a bent bulkhead. 
He was still belted into the pilot’s 
couch, but the unit had tom loose 
from the ship and was jammed 
against several pieces of wreckage. 
When he tried to move, to relieve 
the one, big ache he’d become, he 
shifted the precarious balance, and 
the couch tipped over and fell — 
toward the ceiling. That’s how he 
knew the ship was upside-down. 

“Lin? Hey, Lin! Where are you? 
Are you okay — ?’’ 

“Rss on everybody!’’ came a 
muffled growl; 

Dal managed to unbuckle himself 
and stand on unsteady feet. He 
looked around for the Demi-Whelf, 
but couldn’t spot him. 

A hairy, six-fingered paw burst 
suddenly from a tluck pile of elec- 
tronic wreckage. It was Joined 
quickly by a second paw, which 
began throwing junk in all direc- 
tions. Muffled curses continued to 
filter up through the pile of smashed 
circuitry. Dal moved to help his 
co-pilot. 

“Hey, are you — ?’’ 



“I’m fine!’’ He stood, and dusted 
debris from his thick, brown pelt. 
He sneezed once, and shook his 
head., “Bastards!” Then, “Tulak?” 

Dal grabbed a com headset, but it 
was dead. He threw it down. 
“Come on! We’d better go see 
if — ” 

Smash! The wall separating the 
control pit from the galley burst 
open, as if it was nothing more than 
thin paper! The vast, three-meter- 
high bulk of Tulak suddenly filled 
one end of the room. 

“Are you injured?” he sang. 

★ 

Outside, the three surveyed the 
ruin of the once-proud Starbird. 
The hull was breached in at least 
fifty places, the drives smashed, the 
ship a total loss. It would never fly 
the heavens again. 

“Dammit,” Dal hissed softly. 
“Dammit.” 

The area around the crash site was 
apparently some kind of tropical 
rain forest. There seemed to be a 
large variety of very tall and very 
green trees, some reaching heights 
of fifty meters, and lush vines and 
lower foliage sprouted all over. A 
hundred kinds of flowers dotted the 
area, in shades of red and orange 
and purple and white. The air was 
thick with the smell of plants and 
pollen, and heavy with humidity. 
Dal felt the heat of the sun burning 
down upon him. 

“Wfell,” he said, “it looks as if 
we’ve got a slight problem.” 

“More than one,” Tulak intoned. 

Both Dal and Lincheni turned to 
look at the robot. Tulak was half- 
again Dal’s height, a seamless.

GALAXY 




shining, silver figure, with no 
breaks in his smooth facade — except 
for a thin slit across the middle of 
his otherwise-blank face. Sometimes 
if he looked carefully. Dal could 
see a thin, bluish light behind that 
slit. And the sound with which the 
Trogian Engineers had programmed 
Tul^ to speak also came from 
there — just as it had for nearly 
twelve thousand solar years. Tulak 
was very old — and he had been 
around. 

The robot continued singing. 
“The insignia and numbering sys- 
tem on the ships which attacked us 
have been previously recorded in 
my memory.” 

“And. ?” Dal and Lin asked 
together. 

“They belong to the ships of 
Lord Kreeg Hookthom.” 

“Damn!” 

“But he’s dead!” Lin said. “His 
fleet was wiped out!” 

“His body was never found,” 
Tulak continued. “And depending 
on whose figures were correct, 
anywhere from five to five thousand 
ships were unaccounted for after the 
final battle in the Omicron-Delta 
war.” 

“Oh, shit!” Lin said. 

Yeah, thought Dal. Hookthom! 
Alive! If that was true, they weren’t 
the only ones in trouble! If Hook- 
thom was somehow alive and holed 
up on this backwater planet, re- 
building his navy, the galaxy could 
be in for a big, nasty surprise! 

Another thought occured to Dal, 
but Lin voiced it first. “If it was 
one of Hookthom ’s patrols who 
blasted us, you can bet your last 
cred they are looking for us!” The 
short, squat Demi-Whelf looked up 



at Dal from his stumpy meter-and- 
a-half, and scratched at an insect 
which had landed on his hairy 
shoulder. “And you can tape what 
they’ll do to us if they find us!” 

Yeah. Hookthom wasn’t noted 
for his loving nature. 

“We’d better get out of here.” 
Dal said. 

There wasn’t a lot to be salvaged 
from the dead ship. Only two of the 
skimcycles were still operational — 
one would barely support Tulak ’s 
weight, so Dal and Lin would have 
to tide double on the other. Most of 
the food and water had mptured 
from its containers, and the smell of 
it permeated the cmshed ship. The 
whole thing was a mess! Dal gritted 
his teeth in anger! He’d spent a 
year working the dangerous 

firejewel lode on Cyntax to earn 
enough to buy the Starbird. He’d 
nearly died fifty times! And now, 
only two years later, she 

was ... He shook his head and 
squared his shoulders. 

Somebody was going to pay for 
this! 

But first things first — they had to 
get away from here. 

And, there was yet another prob- 
lem: just where was this? Where 
could they go — especially if Hook- 
thom did have control of this 
world? 

As they gathered what supplies 
they could. Dal asked Tulak what 
he knew about the planet called 
Cynthia Dianne. 

“Planet number 436-70-5395, 
named ‘Cynthia Dianne’ after its 
discoverer, has been colonized by 
humans for three hundred solar 
years. It is the fourth planet in this 
six-planet system, approximately

one-hundred-and-forty-million 
kilometers from its G-type primary 
star. Gravity is point nine terran 
standard. Climate ranges from 
tropical/sub-tropical over most of 
the equatorial and surrounding 
zones, to moderate in the northern 
and southern latitudes. There are 
two polar ice caps, ranging in size 
from — ” 

“Skip all that! What about the 
people? The government? Native in- 
telligence?” 

“Any dangerous animals?” Lin- 
cheni added, looking around at the 
thick jungle. 

“My last input indicates a demo- 
cratic monarchy as the prevailing 
form of government. There is one 
intelligent local life form, the 
Culebrath, a snake-like being which 
rates point seven on the terran 
Raadspin Scale. This creature is re- 
sponsible for one of the planet’s 
main exports of precious metals — ” 

“Something’s out there.” Lin 
hissed, pulling his ceepee from its 
holster. 

Dal Jerked his own particle spitter 
from its black plastic holster. 
“Tulak?” 

The robot turned its face-slit 
toward the thick stand of brush Lin 
was pointing toward. 

“There is a large quadruped hid- 
den in the vegetation,” he said. “I 
am unable to determine if it is 
carnivorous — ” 

There was a splintering of break- 
ing branches, a creaking of larger 
shrubs and trees, and — 

Something broke into the clear- 
ing. It looked something like a 
rhino Dal had seen a picture of 
once, only larger. It was covered 
with a thick plating, a natural ar- 

14 



mor, and from the size and shape of 
its needle-pointed teeth. Dal knew it 
wasn’t a leaf-eater. The wind gUsted 
in their direction, and Lin wrinkled 
his nose. Dal also caught the fetid 
smell — rotting meat, probably trap- 
ped in the teeth of the moster. 

“Uh oh!” Dal said. The thing 
looked tough. Maybe the two spit- 
ters would stop it, maybe not. 
Tulak wasn’t armed with anything 
except his own considerable 
strength — his makers had pro- 
grammed into him an injunction 
against the use of any weapons. 

The situation didn’t look particu- 
larly appealing. 

“Lin! Can you — ?” 

The short Demi-Whelf nodded. 
“I’m trying! It’s mind is strange, 
but dull. ” 

The huge, purple-green creature 
padded heavily forward, its stumpy 
tail twitching, cat-like. 

Dal’s skin crawled. His finger 
wanted to start firing the spitter, but 
he held off. If he didn’t hit it right, 
the wounded beast might kill them. 

“Lin!” The thing was only ten 
meters away now, and still advanc- 
ing purposefully. 

“I think I’ve got it!” Lincheni 
said. And with that, the little 
Demi-Whelf began to change ! 

Lin’s outlines seemed to blur and 
dissolve, to grow and expand! 
Though he’d seen it before. Dal 
was still fascinated. Lincheni ’s form 
shifted, faded, and suddenly — 

It became a replica of the crea- 
ture from the jungle. Only it was 
larger and fiercer looking than the 
original! 

It was the Demi-Whelf’s most po- 
tent defense -^he gift of mimicry. 
The Whelves were empathic in 



GALAXY 




times of danger, and like ultimate 
chameleons, they could appear to 
become like the thing which 
threatened them. They could take 
on the size, shape, color — even the 
smell — because they existed in the 
mind’s eye; they were a splinter of 
imagination. 

Dal didn’t know what the crea- 
ture thought, but he was certain the 
projection was working — the mon- 
ster stopped,. suddenly puzzled. 

Quickly, Dal moved at right 
angles to the beast; it didn’t seem to 
notice him. 

Three meters away, and the rot- 
ten smell was almost overpowering. 
He was almost behind it, and it 
seemed to be a solid-looking mass 
of over-lapping plate. Damn! No, 
wait! There — behind the neck, at 
the base of the huge oval skull. 

A break in the plating! 

The beast still seemed to be puz- 
zled, but it was beginning to sway 
from side-to-side — a sign of attack, 
maybe. It was now or never! 

Dal brought the particle spitter up 
and held it steady in a two-handed 
grip. He aimed at the bare spot. 
Slowly, slowly, don’t jerk, 
dammit — he squeezed the firing 
stud. 

The weapon hummed, the thin 
green stream of charged-and-deadly 
particles burst forth and lanced at 
the creature. The giant roared with 
a sound which shook the leaves in 
the trees. It jumped forward, incred- 
ibly fast for such a large being. 

Tulak spun and pivoted to one 
side as the monster charged by, and 
brought one of his alloy fists down 
onto the thing’s massive head with 
a squishy thump! 

Lincheni jumped to the other 



side, and a stream of ceepee fire 
flared from the too-real looking re- 
plica. Lin’s blast struck the armored 
side of the thing, burned a section 
of hide, then glanced off, without 
any real damage! 

It didn’t matter. The thing lay 
dead, a large, smoking wound in its 
neck. 

The Demi-Whelf began to shim- 
mer and change, and in a moment, 
the short, canine-like figure was 
back to normal. The three of them 
looked down at the fallen animal. 
Dal noted a concave section of 
smashed-and-depressed skull — the 

spot where Tulak had hit in passing. 

“Whew!” 

“Yeah,” Lin added. 

“It would appear my input re- 
garding this world is incomplete. I 
have no record of any such ani- 
mal,” Tulak sang. “It might be 
wise to proceed somewhat cau- 
tiously in the future.” 

Dal and Lin looked up at the im- 
passive face of the robot. 

“Brother!” Dal said. Tulak was 
always the master of understate- 
ment. 

“Let’s finish loading the skimcy- 
cles and proceed cautiously out of 
here.” 

The only problem was, where 
were they going? 

And what were they going to do 
when they got there?” 

Ill 

The skimcycle was crowded, hav- 
ing been designed for only one 
passenger. With Lin and the extra 
supplies, it was a wonder it could 
fly at all. Basically, it was a sim- 
ple, flat platform with a seat, a 



STAR WARRIORS 



15 




too-low plastic windshield, and a 
control panel full of idiot lights. 
The whole thing sat on a repellor 
motor which could be inclined to 
speed up, slow down or stop. It was 
a short-range vehicle, only good for 
a couple thousand kilometers on a 
single charge, and capable of speeds 
no faster than a hundred kilometers 
per hour. 

Among other things. Dal wished 
the damned windshield was higher; 
various insects had been splattering 
their smelly bodies onto his head 
and upper body all morning. The 
bug-spattered plastic only reached 
halfway up Dal’s muscular chest. 
Every now and then, after a particu- 
larly large bug would whap into 
him. Dal would glare down at Lin- 
cheni, who would sit and grin his 
whelf-grin. Since Lin was shorter, 
he wasn’t getting hit nearly as of- 
ten. 

They were flitting just above the 
tops of the tallest trees, Tulak’s 
cycle slightly ahead. The small and 
cheap transceivers on the cycles 
only had a short range — a few 
kilometers — but they occasionally 
picked up some static-ridden signals 
from some distant transmitter. The 
signals seemed to be the strongest 
in the direction of the sunrise, so 
Dal had decided to head in that di- 
rection. 

It was a pretty world, lush rain- 
forest, but Dal was having trouble 
appreciating it. The panorama of 
jungle, the ice-blue sky, the distant 
boom of a far-off thunderstorm 
were all distractions he didn’t want. 
His ship was dead, and somebody 
on this stinking planet had killed 
her! 

He planned to look up whoever 



was responsible. ! 

Suddenly, Tulak’s musical tones 
sang out over the transceiver. 

“Observe to our right. ’’ 

Dal and Lin looked. 

The jungle had given way 
to . something strange. Where 
there was green, thick foliage and 
flowers before, suddenly there was 
a large area of gray-black that 
looked like, of all things, 
a — wheatfield! Even stranger, the 
hot wind which stirred the trees 
below didn’t seem to be affecting 
the strange area! Odd. Very odd. 

“Veer over that way,” Dal 
called to Tulak. “Let’s see what 
that is.” 

The two skimcycles made the 
turn gradually, and began to drop 
lower. 

“Looks like some kind 
of . grass,” Lin said. 

“Yeah, if grass came made in 
long, skinny, gray-iron rods!” 

“There’s a clearing, there, near 
the edge,” Lin said. 

“Good, We need a rest stop 
anyway,” Dal said, wiping a greasy 
bug carcass from his neck. 

“The area seems to be several 
kilometers in area,” Tulak sang 
out. 

“Um.” 

The stuff was taller than it ap- 
peared from the air. Dal guessed its 
height at five meters. It didn’t seem 
to fiiin out at the edge of the clear- 
ing. One spot, there was nothing; 
then, zap, the stuff, in a nice, even 
line. 

They dismounted from the cycles 
and looked carefully around. After 
the episode with the rhino-monster. 
Dal was planning on being very 
cautious. Both he and Lin drew 



16 



GALAXY 




their spitters. Tulak stood im- 
passively by the cycles, turning his 
head slowly to scan the terrain. 

Dal still wondered sometimes 
why Tulak had joined his crew. The 
big robot had been programmed by 
a race which had left the galaxy 
thousands of years ago, and nobody 
was quite sure what his motivations 
were. 

There had been nearly a thousand 
of the blank-faced robots discovered 
at one time or another by several of 
the intelligent races. They seemed 
helpful; they were useful, and they 
signed on with whom they chose. 
Tulak had walked up to Dal one 
day and offered his services. Dal 
had quickly accepted. Aside from 
the fact they were known to be 
good crew, they also had another 
big advantage; they worked for free. 

Lin had moved clo.ser to the 
funny-looking stalks, and Dal pulled 
his mind back to the present and 
followed him. 

Up close, it looked like a section 
of extruded steel rod, diamond- 
shaped, with each piece as big 
around as Dal’s little finger. The 
base of each rod was about eight or 
ten centimeters from the next. He 
was reaching out to touch one when 
Lincheni screamed! 

“Mother of Thity! Spawn of a 
Greff!” 

Dal spun toward Lin, his spitter 
extended and seeking a target. 
There was nothing there, except 
Lin. Slowly he raised from his de- 
fensive crouch: Lin was hopping 
around, slinging one of his paws up 
and down rapidly. 

“What—?” 

“I cut one of my pulating fingers 
on the goddammed rods!” 




Dal inspected the injured digit. 
There was a little of the whelf's 
purple blood, but not much damage. 
He laughed. “Didn’t your mother 
ever tell you not to touch 
strange — 7 ’ ’ 

“Laugh! It’d be different if it 
was your finger!” 

Suddenly, there was a metallic 
ringing, a clanging, as if 
someone — or something — was bang- 
ing into the rods. 

The sound was coming from in- 
side the field! Dal looked at Lin. 
Whatever the rods were, plant or 
mineral, they were hard and sharp, 
sharp enough to cut flesh at a 
touch! If something was in there, 
moving around without being cut to 
tatters . 

“Suddenly this stuff doesn’t seem 
all that interesting,” Dal said quick- 
ly. 



STAR WARRIORS

“I agree!” 

In twenty seconds, the three were 
airborne again, heading away from 
the strange rods. 

★ 

They had been in transit for 
nearly eight hours. Tulak had in- 
formed them that the planet had a 
twenty-one hour cycle, so there was 
only a little daylight remaining. 

They had begun looking for a 
clearing for camp when Tulak spot- 
ted the structure. 

“There is a small building about 
a kilometer to our left,” he said, in 
his off-hand sing-song. “It appears 
to be of humanoid construction.” 

They put the cycles into a tight 
turn, and dropped lower to utilize 
the cover of the trees. It might not 
be civilization, but it was a sign 
they were getting there. So far. Dal 
hadn’t worried about what to do 
when they reached it, but he sup- 
posed it was time to start thinking 
about it. 

The sun was mostly gone, but the 
heat and dampness lingered, and he 
felt clammy. The smell of smashed 
insects reminded him of rotten fruit. 

Dal wished he was in space, in 
his ship, in the clean vacuum he 
loved. True, he’d been something 
of a disreputable citizen; a 
privateer, a gun-runner, a charter- 
for-pay, no-questions-asked captain 
of a ship which sometimes barely 
kept going. But it was his choice of 
life — and far better than being a 
ground-pounder. 

Like he was now. In this god- 
forsaken hole at the end of the 
Galaxy! 

Well. They were going to leave 



this world. If there were ships 
which could shoot him down, there 
were ships to be had. One way or 
another! They owed him one, and 
by all the gods and stars, he was 
going to get one! «r 

They put the cycles down half a 
klick from the building and its small 
clearing. They started toward it, 
weapons at the ready. 

The “building” was little more 
than a crude hut. It was made from 
rough wood, lashed together with 
some kind of vine; the roof was 
thatched with a type of broad, 
blue-green leaf. Except for some 
crude, wooden furniture and a 
mouldy animal skin rug, the hut 
seemed empty. There were no signs 
of life around it. 

“What now?” Lin whispered. 

“See if you can find somebody,” 
Dal said. “Don’t let them see 
you.” 

They turned to look at Tulak. 
Even in the gathering dusk, he was 
highly visible. “Tulak, maybe you 
ought to stay back in the trees!” 

They split up, and Dal started to 
work his way around the edge of 
the clearing. The insects which had 
been splattering him all day seemed 
to abound here — the air seemed 
alive with the damned things, buzz- 
ing everywhere. The heavy air 
brought smells of jungle; rotting 
plants mixed with the odor of pol- 
len. When he was nearly halfway 
round the clearing, he passed a 
large tree, and there was the old 
man. 

It was hard to determine the 
man’s age or race. He was human, 
but could have been seventy or a 
hundred. His skin was leathery 
brown, but that could have been 



18 



GALAXY 




from the sun. He was bald, his head 
was thrown back, and he was star- 
ing into the sky. He sat in a knotted 
cross-legged fashion, his arms 
folded across his chest, and his 
thim muscular body was naked, ex- 
ce* for a pendant on a leather 
thong around his neck. 

Nothing very unusual — except the 
old man was sitting ten centimeters 
off the ground! 

Dal looked for devices — motors, 
wires, this was absurd! — but 
couldn’t see anything! The man 
was — WHS— floating! In the damp 
air, without support! That was im- 
possible! 

As he watched, the old man 
brought his head down, until he was 
looking straight ahead. Dal slipped 
back behind the tree, so that only 
his face was uncovered. In the 
shadows, he’d be hidden — 

The bald man turned his eyes, 
then his head, to look directly to- 
ward Dal. He knew he couldn’t be 
seen, still — 

“Greetings,” the man said, in a 
strong voice. “Welcome to my 
home.” Perfect Interspeak too! 

Dal’s mind stalled. He’d seen a 
lot of strange sights on a lot of dif- 
ferent worlds — this had to be a 
trick! 

“You can come out,” the old 
man continued. “Call your friends, 
too. I won’t hurt you.” 

Well, shit! Dal moved from be- 
hind the tree, his already clammy 
skin gone suddenly wetter with 
nervous sweat. The spitter’s plastic 
handle felt slippery in his hand, de- 
spite the sharp checkering on the 
grips. He pointed the weapon at the 
old man, still hovering in the air. 

“Don’t make any sudden 



moves!” he said. Oh, boy, was that 
a stupid thing to say! There was a 
dry-bitter taste in 'his mouth. 

“Why not?” The old man 
seemed amused. 

Dal waved the spitter. “Because 
I’ve got this!” 

“Oh, that? You can’t hurt any- 
thing with that — it doesn’t work.” 

Involuntarily, Dal glanced down 
at the weapon. “Oh? We’ll see how 
it works!” He pointed the ceepee 
pistol at a tree branch on the ground 
near — no, under — the old man, and 
pulled the firing stud. A little heat 
would show the old bastard — 

Nothing happened! Dal’s stomach 
flip- flopped, and the dry-bitter taste 
in his mouth turned into pure dust 
and quinidex! He tried again. Noth- 
ing! 

“Lin!” As he yelled, Dal saw 
the old man begin to settle slowly 
to the ground. By the time Lincheni 
arrived at a dead-run, the naked fig- 
ure was seated on the earth, smil- 
ing broadly. 

“Lin, shoot that tree.” He 
pointed with his own useless pistol. 

The Demi-Whelf never hesitated. 
He fired, and a ninny, burned-black 
spot appeared on the trunk. There 
was the smell of cooked wood and 
boiled sap. 

Dal stared at his own spitter. He 
jerked it up and pointed it at the 
same tree. Another burned spot 
erupted sap! The smell grew 
stronger. 

“How — ? — Lin, this old man, 
he — ” 

“What old man? What are you 
talking about?” 

Dal spun. The old man was gone! 
But — 

“There was an old man, there! 

19 



STAR WARRIORS 




You ran right past him. I saw him 
floating in the air — ” he stopped. 
Lin was looking at him funny. 
“Hey, look, I swear — ! Come on, 
he was there \ Let’s get back to that 
hut. ’’ 

At the hut, they found Tulak 
regarding the door. Dal glaneed at 
Lin, then said, “Tulak, did you see 
an old man — ?’’ 

“Inside,” Tulak sang. 

Thank the gods I’m not crazy! 
Dal thought. Aloud, he said, 
“Come on!” He and Lin started to 
move for the door. Suddenly, one 
of Tulak *s massive arms came up to 
stop them. 

“Tulak— what— ?” 

“Wait.” 

“Wait? Tulak, move\ 

“Wait.” 

What the hell was going on here? 
Tulak was blocking the door. But 
nobody could control the big robot. 
Just what — ? 

Suddenly the door opened. A 
faint smell of some fragrant smoke 
wafted out, and the old man ap- 
peared in the doorway. 

He was dressed now, in snug 
leather breeches and a pull-over silk 
shirt. He wore high-topped boots, 
and had a large, wicked-looking 
knife in a clear plastic sheath strap- 
ped to the front of his right thigh. 
His bald head gleamed dully in the 
dimming light. 

“Thank you, Tulak,” he sang, in 
the tongue-twisting Trogian song- 
language. 

“You — you speak Trogian? But 
how — ?” Dal was at a loss, con- 
fused. Understanding the language 
was hard. For a human to speak it 
was almost unheard of. 

“I haven’t always lived on this 

20 



planet,” the old man said. “But if 
you will come inside, I will be 
happy to answer your questions. 

Dal looked at Lin and Tulak. 
Numbly, he nodded. 

IV 

Inside the rude hut. Dal got 
another shock. 

Under the crudely tanned skin rug 
on the rough floor, there was a 
massive wooden trap-door. Under 
that, a set of descending stairs. 
They followed the stairs down, 
through a damp smelling stone cor- 
ridor which twisted several times, 
and finally — 

Gods! There was a huge room, at 
least thirty meters on a side. And it 
was filled with furniture, books, 
holo equipment, machines. 

Just what the hell was going on? 

“I expected you sooner,” the old 
man said. “I didn’t think you’d 
stop at the weed patch.” 

Lin and Dal glanced at each 
other, then at Tulak. Whoever this 
person was, he was damned well in- 
formed. Too well informed. 

“Have a seat,” the old man said. 
“I’ll get some refreshments.” He 
whistled, and a short and stubby 
servobot appieared, carrying a tray 
of plastic juicebulbs. 

Dal looked down at his weapon, 
still clutched tightly in his hand. Si- 
lently, he bolstered the spitter. This 
whole thing was crazy, but the old 
man didn’t seem dangerous. Be- 
sides, he had already shown he 
could make the ceepee pistol mal- 
function. Dal sat on a nearby 
form-chair. Lincheni did the same, 
although his eyes kept darting 
around the perimeter of their furry

sockets, watching for anything un- 
usual. 

Hell, it was all unusual! 

“1 neglected to introduce myself. 
I am Lao Emba, student of Ch’an, 
and owner of this place. May I ask 
your names?” 

Reluctantly, Dal told him. ‘‘I’m 
Dal Hamsun, captain — uh, former 
captain of the ship Starbird. This is 
Lincheni, my first, and Tulak — 
whom it seems you’ve already 
met. ” 

Emba grinned, showing even and 
white teeth. ‘‘Ah, Tulak. How long 
has it been? Twenty years?” 

‘‘Twenty-two terran standards,” 
Tulak sang. 

Dal did a double-take. So they 
had met before! 

The servobot passed, and without 
thinking. Dal took a container of 
juice. It had a pleasant, musky 
taste. 

‘‘How did you do that — float in 
the air like that?” Dal asked. 

‘‘A simple re-routing of gravita- 
tional attraction — not unlike the re- 
pellor motors on your own cycles.” 

‘‘But howl 1 couldn’t see any 
machines.” 

‘‘Oh, there weren’t any. It’s a 
mental device, one of the Ch’an 
exercises — a toy, really. A simple 
application of attaching one’s Flow 
to the Universal Flow.” 

Uh. Yeah, sure, whatever that 
meant. ‘‘You say you and Tulak 
know each other?” 

‘‘We did once. A long time ago 
in a place far away. ” 

Dal couldn’t believe this. Here he 
was, in some underground palace 
on a strange planet, talking to a 
man who could float in the air! And 
a man who knew his robot! 



‘‘This . Ch’an you speak of, 
it’s some kind of religious belief?” 

“In a way.” 

Dal looked dubious, and Emba 
laughed. 

“Did you think religious men 
wore old robes and long beards and 
lived in huts like that one above 
here?” 

Dal shmgged uncomfortably . 
“Something like that.” 

Emba laughed again. “Don’t be- 
lieve everything you hear, boy. 
There are anti-esthetics like that — 
but it’s not necessary to go that far. 
Those who want to suffer for their 
beliefs don’t play with full decks. 
True,” he waved his hand, “all this 
isn’t needed or required. But as 
long as it’s available, why shouldn’t 
I enjoy it?” 

Dal found an interesting spot on 
his boot and studied it. 

“How did you know we were 
coming?” Lincheni demanded sud- 
denly. 

“I tracked your ship down on 
radar after Hookthom’s boys blasted 
you. ” 

Dal jerked his head up. “You 
know Hookthom?” 

“Not personally. I know he 
brought four thousand ships here a 
year ago and took over the plane- 
tary government.” 

“Son-of-a-bitch! Then he is 
building a new navy!” 

‘ ‘Seems that way . ’ ’ 

“What’s the local populace doing 
about it?” 

“Nothing. Hookthom wiped out 
the local token armed forces when 
he came in. These people are 
peaceful — farmers and miners, 
mostly. There’s about fifty million 
of them here. They’re tough indi- 



22 



GALAXY 




viduals, but not soldiers. They don’t 
know how to fight.” 

‘‘Yeah, well, we can — at least 
well enough to get the ship they 
owe us!” 

‘‘I have no doubt of that.” He 
sighed. ‘‘Do you know what will 
happen if Hookthom can assemble 
any kind of fighting force before the 
Confederation finds him? He’ll 
jump some world and start another 
galaxy-wide war!” 

‘‘Yeah, probably.” 

“And once they discover that this 
is his home base, the idiots that run 
the Confederation will no doubt try 
to blast it out of the sky! All these 
innocent people will die!” 

Dal studied his boot again. “Too 
bad.” 

‘‘And most likely they’ll ruin my 
home, as well! Even if they don’t, 
who wants to live on a burned out 
cinder?” 

Dal looked up. Here was a twist! 
‘‘I can’t let that happen.” 

“Oh?” Dal looked at Lin, who 
seemed to shrink into the massaging 
form-chair. ‘‘Just what do you plan 
to do about it?” 

‘‘We’ll have to stop him.” 

•We?” 

‘‘Yes. The four of us.” 

Dal jumped to his feet. ‘‘You’re 
crazy! You expect /our of us to go 
against Hookthom? If he’s got four 
thousand ships, that means he’s got 
probably fifty thousand troops!” 
‘‘More or less,” Emba said, the 
grin on his face never wayering. 

‘‘Sorry, old man, you can count 
us out. We’ll just rip off a ship and 
be gone. Maybe we’ll drop the 
Confeds a note telling them where 
Hookthom is stashed; other than 
that, sorry. We have places to go. 



I’m afraid we can’t help you.” 

Emba didn’t move. ‘‘Oh, but you 
will!” 

Dal suddenly felt himself grow 
sleepy. His vision swam and blur- 
red. He looked at the juice con- 
tainer, then up at Emba’s face. 
‘‘Dmgs! You drugged us!” 

‘‘Don’t be ridiculous,” Emba 
said. “Why would 1 go to all that 
trouble? It’s just a touch of the 
Flow to your sleep center. While 
you’re resting. Tulak and I will 
catch up on old times.” 

Dal reached for his spitter, but he 
knew he’d never make it in time. 

He didn't. 

V 

He was in some rickety kind of 
aircraft, flying over a slaughtered, 
desolate world! Beneath him lay the 
ruins of a civilization — burned out, 
blasted, destroyed — and still smok- 
ing. He was close enough to see the 
bodies of people — gods, thousands 
upon thousands of them! They were 
twisted into hoirible shapes, some 
frozen in flight, some burned into 
crisp statues by the effects of terri-' 
ble radiation — 

The aircraft turned, a right-angle, 
dizzying turn, and another, vaster 
killed area swam into view. The 
walls around him seemed to dis- 
solve, vanish; and now he could not 
only see the dead, he could smell 
them, could smell the cooked flesh! 
He wanted to vomit, and the sour, 
reflux taste filled his throat, but 
could not seem to come up — 

He could hear them! Somehow, 
some of the poor bastards had lived 
through the destruction! They were 
calling, crying out for hel —

He wasn’t in the ship anymore! 
He was on the ground, walking 
through the victims! He could feel 
them brush against his legs as he 
walked. Clutching, bony hands 
touched his feet! Horrible things 
crackled under his boots, things 
which had once been human — 

★ 

His eyes popped op>en, and Dal 
was suddenly awake. Sweat rolled 
from him, despite the coolness of 
the room’s air conditioners, and he 
found his fists were so tightly 
clenched the nails had cut into his 
palms. He glanced at his chrono. It 
was morning. 

Across from him, Lao Emba sat, 
staring over the tops of his tented 
fingers. 

“1 trust you had pleasant 
dreams?” 

“It was . .” Bat shook his 
head. “It — I — wait! It was only a 
dream, wasn’t it?” 

“Yes. But one which could come 
true. ” 

Lin began stirring in his chair. As 
Dal watched, the Demi-Whelf blur- 
red around the edges, as he did 
when he changed during periods of 
danger. Dal looked back at Emba. 
“All those dead people. ...” 

“You could help stop it,” the old 
man said. 

“How? What could four of us do 
against Hookthom’s army? 

“There are ways.” 

Lin seemed to be waking up, and 
he looked as bad as Dal felt. “You 
okay?” 

The Demi-Whelf nodded, but he 
was shaky. 

Dal sighed, and looked at Emba. 



The images of the dead and dying 
floated in his mind. The smell, the 
sound, they’d been so real! “All 
right. I’ll do what you want.” 

“And 1,” Lin added. 

“Lin, you don’t have to!” Dal 
knew Lincheni had only signed on 
originally for the chance at big 
money. It took a lot of creds to buy 
breeding rights on his world — there 
weren’t enough female whelves. He 
couldn’t ask Lin to join this — this 
suicide plan! 

“1 saw those people,” Lin said. 
“My people. 1 will do what I can!” 

Dal nodded. “You seem to know 
Tulak better than we do, so it looks 
like you’ve got yourself a crew.” 

“Good! I knew you were reason- 
able! I’m glad 1 didn’t have to do 
anything drastic to get your atten- 
tion!” 

“Drastic?” Crap! What could be 
more drastic? 

“The dream you had — it could 
have been made permanent.” 

Dal shuddered, and Lin swore 
softly under his breath. 

“So what now?” Dal asked. 

“We’ll have to go to Ste’nel, this 
world’s largest city. There are 
people there who will be ready to 
help. 1 have an old friend who is a 
senator — he’ll know who can be 
trusted.” 

“And then?” 

“One step at a time, boy, one 
step at a time.” 

★ 

Incredibly, there were other 
rooms hidden under the ground, 
some larger than the first one they’d 
seen! In one of these, a vast cave 
hollowed from damp, gray rock.

GALAXY 




was a ten-passenger flitter, fully- 
rigged for atmosphere running! 

“It seems our hermit friend is a 
man of means,’’ Lin said. His voice 
echoed in the huge chamber. 

“Yeah. It seems.’’ So far, every- 
thing about this Emba was impres- 
sive. Dal was interested in finding 
out more about this mysterious 
Ch’an — he had the idea that floating 
in the air and bad dreams were only 
the tip of the iceberg. 

“They will have found your ship 
by now, and noted the lack of 
bodies,’’ Emba said. “We’ll have 
to be careful. Hookthorn will have 
tightened security.’’ 

“Maybe not. There were . 
things in the jungle which could 
have easily disposed of our 
corpses.’’ 

“And eaten two skimcycles, as 
well?’’ 

Dal shrugged. No, Hookthorn 's 
trackers wouldn’t be careless. When 
he’d been a gunner on the Go 
Placid during the war, he’d seen 
just how careful the enemy was. 
After their ship had been hit and 
disabled, a number of the men had 
abandoned her, in lifecraft or deep- 
suits. Hookthorn ’s men had tracked 
each one down and blasted them! 
No prisoners! The only reason he 
and a few others had survived was 
because a big section of the Con- 
federation’s fleet had arrived before 
the crippled ship could be totally 
destroyed. 

No, Hookthorn ’s men wouldn’t 
be careless — or merciful. 

Lord Kreeg Hookthorn. And his 
wife, the Lady Ursula — the Lady 
with Smoke Eyes — he had reason to 
hate them! They’d cost him friends 
and relatives! But that had been the 




war, and it was always 
impersonal — he’d never seen Hook- 
thorn, only his ships. When the war 
was over — everybody thought 

Hookthorn was dead — Dal had 
buried his memories, and gone to 
work to get his own ship. 

Only now, it was much more 
personal! They’d killed the Star- 
bird\ When he’d been seventeen, it 
had all been a big game, not real. 
Now, he was nearly twenty-three, 
and he knew more about life. The 
bastards had cut him off from space 
with no more thought than squash- 
ing a bug. Ah, to be left alone with 
the man responsible for just two 
minutes. 

Emba cut into his thoughts. 
“We’re three hundred kilometers 
from the city. It will take half an 
hour to get there and I want to get 
moving. Load up.’’ 



STAR WARRIORS

Once aloft, Dal asked Emba a 
question. “Something’s been 
bothering me. Granted, you could 
track our ship down on radar — how 
did you know about our stop at the 
patch of gray-rods'? Your radar 
couldn’t have followed us at tree- 
top level — not that far away.’’ 

Emba .set the autopilot and turned 
to face Dal. “I could say it was be- 
cause the weed was in your path — 
that 1 figured you’d head for the 
strongest radio transmissions, that 
you'd be curious and stop. ’’ 

“You could. But you knewl It 
wasn't a guess!’’ 

“True,” he said, with a chuckle. 
“Actually, Snegala told me.” 
Snegala? Dal glanced at Lin. Had 
they been watched? 

“He’s one of the Culebrath. That 
was his patch you stopped at.” 
Culebrath. Where had he heard 
that — ? Oh. Tulak had mentioned 
something about a local intelligent 
life-form. 

“The ‘rods’ you saw are actually 
a sort of crystal-plant. Biologically 
speaking, they are quite unique — a 
variant form of fungus. The rods 
are all part of a common 
mycelium — all part of one plant — in 
that patch, at least. The stalks are 
composed primarily of iron, with 
smaller amounts of copper, lead and 
gold. Don’t ask me how it can 
exist — it simply does.” 

He paused a few seconds, then 
added, “The Culebrath eat it.” 

“Eat it? Those sticks are as sharp 
as vibro — . ” 

“The Culebrath are very tough. 
They crawl around through the 
stalks — they look something like 
snakes, with fins — and snip the 
stems at the base. Then they swal- 

26 



low the cut pieces along the 
length.” 

“Pourn’s balls!” Lin said. 

Emba continued. “They utilize 
most of the mineral and fiber, and 
excrete the rest — precious metals 
mostly.” 

Dal started to speak, but Lin beat 
him to it. “They shit gold?” 

Emba laughed. “Yes, if you want 
to put it that way. ” 

Wait. Dal remembered something 
else Tulak had said earlier. Some- 
thing about the export of precious 
metals . Hmm. Put that together 
with Emba's comment about most 
of the people on this planet being 
farmers or miners. 

Aloud, Dal said, “You mean the 
people here make a living collecting 
snake turds? Gold snake turds?” 

Emba laughed louder. “It’s a 
fairly big part of the industry here.” 

“Well I’ll be damned!” 

“As will I!” Lin added. 

“You’ll get a chance to meet 
some of the Culebrath,” Emba said. 
“We’ll need their help against 
Hookthom.” 

Oh, yeah. That. For a moment. 
Dal had forgotten their suicide mis- 
sion. Gods, if the folks on Niven- 
raad could see him now. Going to 
fight fifty thousand troops, with a 
crazy old man, a whelf, a giant 
robot, and some gold-crapping 
snakes! Nobody would believe it. 

Dal didn’t believe it! 

VI 

From the outskirts, Ste’nel looked 
just like any other fairly large fron- 
tier town. The jungle had been 
cleared away and kept down, and 
the bulk of the town squatted in the 



GALAXY 




center of the cleared space. The 
streets were laid out in long, 
straight rows. It was hard to see 
much in the just-breaking dawn, but 
in the distance, there was what 
looked like a military base. 

There didn’t seem to be much 
traffic in the streets or the air, and 
Dal said as much. 

“Hookthom has the entire planet 
under martial law. You need a good 
reason to be out. ” 

“Oh? And what’s our reason?” 
Dal glanced back at Tulak and Lin. 
“How do you explain us if we’re 
stopped?” 

“We won’t be stopped.” 

“You seem awfully sure!” 

“I understand the whelves have a 
trick, whereby they can appear to 
be something other than what they 
are. ” 

Dal nodded. 

“To any who view us closely, 
we appiear to be a command flitter, 
bearing the insignia of an Under- 
General. We won’t be stopped.” 

“Yeah, well that’s fine for line 
of sight. What about the local air 
traffic controller? Do we sound like 
an Under-General to the ATC, 
too?” 

Emba regarded him as one might 
a child asking a naive question. 
“Of course.” 

Dal looked at Lin. The Demi- 
Whelf shrugged. “Of course. You 
heard the man!” 

There was a sudden lurch, and 
Dal’s seat-harness cut into his mus- 
cles! The ship seemed to bounce 
crookedly through the air! 

“What—?” 

Emba’s hands were busy at the 
controls, putting the flitter into a 
power dive. “It’s one of the 



damned clone-drones! 1 didn’t fig- 
ure on them being out. ” 

Dal jerked his head around to- 
ward Tulak. “What’s a clone- 
drone?” 

“A drone-fighter, run by the 
extracted brain of an intelligent be- 
ing’s clone. ” 

“Why didn’t your voodoo trick 
fool him, Emba?” 

The ship bucked, and dropped 
with a stomach-twisting free-fall. 

“Because the damned clone brain 
doesn’t see with eyes. It uses elec- 
tronic cameras and sensors, then 
checks them. ” 

Ah! So this magical Ch’an did 
have limits! Dal was almost glad — 
until he realized those limits might 
get them all killed! 

“I’ll get the weapons system go- 
ing.” he yelled. 

“1 doubt it,” Lin said. “There 
doesn’t seem to be one.” 

“What? Emba—?” 

“He’s right. “I’ve never needed 
one. The Ch’an — ” 

“Is going to get us blown out of 
the sky!” 

“We’ll have to land,” Emba 
said. “The clone ship will have 
called for manned back-up. I think 1 
can handle them on the ground, but 
it’ll be tricky!” 

The ship jumped sideways, as if 
struck by a pounding wave. 

“Tulak can stay with me, but 1 
don’t want to try too much. Dal, 
you and Lin will have to get to 
Senator Hanshi’s — I’ll meet you 
there!” 

“How? I don’t know where it 
is — ” 

“Be still!” 

With that. Dal suddenly had an 
image of the senator’s house, the 



STAR WARRIORS 



27 




streets around it, and even what the 
senator looked like! 

“How did — ?” 

“A memory impress. It’s been 
five years since I’ve been there, but 
things won’t .have changed that 
much. You’ll have to make do. I’m 
going to be busy trying to convince 
a squad of troops that what they are 
seeing is more accurate than the 
tape on a drone’s memory!’’ 

The flitter slewed into a ragged 
landing on a cleared field. Dal’s 
head thunked against the inner hull. 

“Go! Get out of here before the 
soldiers arrive!’’ 

Dal and Lin scrambled from the 
flitter and ran quickly away. If any- 
thing, the city was hotter than the 
jungle. Probably due to the output 
of air conditioners and all the heat 
retaining stone and plastcrete. 

They made it to the shadow of a 
big storage house, and rested briefly 
next to the pre-cast green plastic 
wall. There was an oily smell in the 
air, and the distant hum of machin- 
ery. Ground-bound civilization. 
Bah! 

“Let’s get moving,” Dal said. 
“When people start waking up, we 
don’t want to be wangling 
around. ” 

★ 

Senator Hanshi’s house appeared 
quiet. It was a large wooden struc- 
ture, a split-level, dorsi-style unit, 
set back into a group of cloaking 
trees and bushes. The foliage was 
thicker than Dal “remembered”. 
Although it was still early morning, 
the nearest residence was close 
enough to see anyone entering or 
leaving by the front portal. 

28 



“We’d better go around back,” 
Dal said. “I’m not sure the senator 
would want his neighbors to know 
we ’ve come to call . ’ ’ 

They made their way through the 
brush to the rear of the house. 
There was a tall, wooden fence 
around the back, with a single gate 
at one end. It was, naturally, 
locked. 

“Over the top. ” Dal hissed. He 
boosted Lincheni up, then caught 
the edge of the two-and-a-half meter 
high fence himself. The wood had a 
pleasant, evergreen smell, but the 
top was rough, and he felt the jab 
of several splinters as they dug into 
his palms. He pulled himself up and 
over — it wasn ’t too bad — and 

fell — and landed square on top of a 
prickly bush! 

“Ouch! Mother—!” 

“Shhh!” Lin hissed. “Somebody 
might get the wrong idea.” 

The back portal was a single, 
thick sheet of plastiglass. It was 
locked. 

Dal knocked. No answer. He 
tried again. Still nothing. 

“Now what?” Lin said, looking 
around nervously. “Nobody’s 
home.” 

“Let’s try a window.” 

But all the windows on ground 
level were opaque-polarized and 
locked. 

They moved back to the door, 
and D^ drew his spitter. 

“Hey, you gonna bum the door? 
I don’t know — ” 

“I’ll buy him a new one. If one 
of those clone-drones just happens 
to flit by and see us . ” 

“Ye^, okay, I get your point.” 
Dal directed a short burst of 
ceepee at the lock. The green blow 



GALAXY 




of the charged particles was soon 
joined by the white-hot gleam of the 
lock melting. The plastic vaporized 
with a smell like burned boot-sole. 

They slid the door open, and 
found themselves in a kitchen. Dal 
kept the spitter out, and they moved 
down a short hallway into a large 
room. 

“The senator has nice taste,” Lin 
said, picking up a small, metal 
sculpture of a nude woman. 

Dal grinned. “How would you 
know? Your women all look like 
dogs to me — ” 

“Shhh! I heard something!” 

“What? I don’t—” 

“Make one move and you’ll both 
be dead!” said a woman’s voice 
from behind them. 

Dal froze. 

“Drop your weapons — very 

carefully — and turn around.” 

The two spitters fell lightly to the 
thick rug, and Dal and Lin turned 
slowly. 

“Oh, wow!” Dal said. The 
woman standing on the stairs looked 
to be about nineteen. She was tall 
and slender, and absolutely beauti- 
ful! Her short, dark hair covered her 
head like a loose cap, and the thin 
fabric of her sleeping gown failed to 
hide the heavy curve of high breasts 
and the slender, perfectly shaped 
legs, and — the poisoned dartslinger 
pointed rock-steady at his stomach! 

The girl moved down the stairs 
until she was two meters away from 
them. 

“What are you doing here?” she 
demanded. 

It was then Dal knew he’d been 
in space too long. Here was one of 
the most gorgeous women he’d ever 
seen, and all he could say was, 



“Uh, we — uh, that is — well, we — 
uh. ...” 

“Very bright. Come on! Who 
are — ?” 

And Lincheni began to change. 

The girl swung the dartslinger 
toward him. “What are you — ?” 

And then there were two women, 
both identical to Dal’s eyes! 

The real girl seemed startled for a 
second, and Dal sprang at her, arms 
outstretched. He caught her shoul- 
ders, and for a second, he had time 
to feel the imprint of her breasts on 
his chest, time to smell her exotic 
perfume, time to feel the firm, slim 
muscles of her body against him. 

Then, abruptly, he was sailing 
through the air, twisting, awkwardly 
off-b^ance. He slammed into a 
wall. The wind was knocked from 
his lungs. He slid to the carpet, 
stunned, and — the girl had them 
covered again! 

“I don’t know how you did that, 
fur-face, but it won’t work!” 

Lin shimmered, and changed 
back to his normal form. Dal 
grinned stupidly from the floor, still 
remembering the feel of her body. 
Then he felt the ache in his shoul- 
der where he’d hit. Slowly, he got 
to his feet. This lady knew some- 
thing about how to protect herself. 

“Hey, look, we’re trying to find 
Senator Hanshi,” he finally man- 
aged. 

“Is that the way you normally 
look for someone? Break into his 
house and attack his daughter?” 

“It’s a long story,” Dal said, 
feeling sheepish. 

“Fine,” she said, gesturing to- 
ward a couch with the slinger. 
“Why don’t you tell me all about 
'it.” 



STAR WARRIORS 



29 




★ 

“That’s incredible,” she said, 
still pointing the slinger at them. 

“But true,” Lin added. 

“How do I know Lao really sent 
you?” 

“Like I said, he is supposed to 
meet us here.” Dal was feeling a 
little more comfortable. At least she 
hadn't started shooting yet. “And 
where is the Senator, anyway?” 

The girl’s expression masked; her 
eyes flicked down, then quickly 
back up. “He’s . dead. Hook- 
thorn had him killed for resisting 
the take-over. The government’s 
been disbanded.” 

“I’m sorry.” 

“We’re going to wait and see if 
Lao Emba comes here, as you 
said.” 

“And if he doesn’t. ?” 

‘ ‘Then you ’re either criminals or 
Hookthom’s men — which is the 
same thing, as far as I’m con- 
cerned. Either way. ...” she 
trailed off. 

Dal glanced at Lin, then back at 
the girl. 

Somehow, that didn’t sound at all 
good. 

VII 

“Tanya!” Emba came in, fol- 
lowed by Tulak. 

“Uncle Lao!” 

Uncle Lao? How could anybody 
call him ‘uncle’? 

Emba looked at Dal and Lin, and 
at the dartspitter. “Well, Tanya, I 
see you’ve already met two of the 
leaders of our future liberation 
army.” 

“Them?” 



“Them. They . uh, volun- 
teered, after their ship was 
blasted.” 

The girl dropped her gun into the 
chair carelessly. “If these are lead- 
ers, we’re in trouble!” 

Emba sighed. “It’s been a long 
year, but they’ll do. Where’s your 
father?” 

She told him, and the old man 
seemed to age further and collapse. 
He dropped heavily into a chair, 
sudden exhaustion drawing lines 
on his face. “Forgive me — I — the 
strain of keeping up the facade for 
the robot and myself was great. 
And now — your father. ...” 

She touched his gnarled hands 
with her own smooth fingers. 

Dal stood up. “Lin and I need 
some water. We’ll . uh, be in 
the kitchen. Anything we can get 
you?” 

Emba shook his head. 

“Uncle Lao, there’s so much to 
tell you. So much has happened in 
the last six months!” 

Lin followed Dal to the kitchen. 
“What’s this about? You know I 
don’t drink plain water. ” 

“I’ll tell you what — I’m tired of 
being somebody’s puppet.” Since 
we broke hyperspace, we’ve been 
running around like smerps with our 
heads amputated!” 

“So? What options — ?” 

“I’m going to make some op>- 
tions. The old man painted us a 
dreary picture of bodies littering the 
landscape — but I’m kind of fond of 
my own body. ” 

“I don’t — ” 

“Okay, look, we committed our- 
selves to help — but I’m no martyr! 
After we met Emba, I started thi^- 
ing about our chances of stealing a

GALAXY 




ship and sneaking off-planet. You 
saw what twelve ships did to us — 
imagine what four thousand could 
do — if there really are four 
thousand. ” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I mean, how do we know just 
what the hell is going on? So far. 
I’ve been willing to stick with the 
old man, but 1 don’t trust anybody 
where my ass is on the line. There 
are things he isn’t telling us!” 

“Such as?” 

“Such as that comment about it 
being a ‘long year’! Such as that 
remark the girl made about so much 
going on in the last six months. He 
says he hasn’t been here in five 
years — but it sounds like the girl 
saw him more recently than that. I 
think he’s had something cooking 
for some time, and I don’t know 
where we fit into it ail.” 

“So what are you going to do?” 
“A little exploring.” 

Dal slipped the empty holster 
from his belt and pulled his tunic 
out to cover his waist. “See if you 
can slip back while they’re busy 
talking and get my spitter.” 

When Lin returned with the 
weapon. Dal tucked it inside his 
pants and covered it with the loose 
tunic. 

“What’ll 1 tell the old man?” 
“Tell him I went for a walk. I’ll 
be back by dark. ” 

“Take it easy, huh?” 

Dal grinned. “You kidding? 
Don’t worry. ”

generators squatting on the bare 
ground, and the electronic spy-eyes 
which triggered them sunk into the 
shiny-steel fence po.sts. 

Anybody who tried to climb that 
fence would become just that — a 
body — and probably well-done, at 
that! He’d have to get in at one of 
the gates. 

Another problem. There were 
guards at the gates. He couldn’t just 
walk in — that would likely get him 
as dead as trying to climb the fence. 

Obviously, the only way into the 
base would be in a vehicle the 
guards wouldn’t stop. It wasn’t 
likely a general would stop for 
hitchhikers, either. 

An old memory glimmered in the 
back of his mind. When he’d been 
a kid, he’d joined a club which had 
required its members to sneak into a 



We’re

The perimeter fence around the 
camp didn’t seem to be guarded. 
Then Dal saw the automatic laser 



STAR WARRIORS 



31 





guarded spaceport. 

He grinned as he remembered the 
details of that escapade when he 
was twelve. Sure! That kind of 
transport would come and go freely, 
even on a military base. There was 
a wooded area back on the road. A 
fair-sized tree branch on the 
plastcrete would slow his ride down 
enough, 

★ 

It was a lot worse than he’d re- 
membered. Even though the truck 
was only lightly loaded going in, it 
still wasn’t any fun being buried 
under a layer of garbage, ^e feel 
of it was both gritty and slimy, and 
the smell of it in the hot tropical 
morning sun was enough to make 
him wish he didn’t have to breathe. 
He wondered how he could have 
forgotten the odor of rotten vegeta- 
bles and rancid meat scraps. 

He jumped from the truck at the 
first stop, and quickly hid between 
two of the dozens of plastic porta- 
dump bins. 

Well, genius, you’re inside the 
base. Now what? Planning ahead 
had never been one of his strong 
points. It was one of the reasons he 
was such a lousy chess player. He 
preferred to play things by feel, and 
improvise as needed. Sometimes it 
worked. Other times. 

Okay, okay. You obviously can’t 
walk around like this. Aside from 
the fact you stink, your clothes are 
wrong. Hmmm. 

He let four men dump plastic 
bags into the poita-dumps b^ause 
they were too big or too small. The 
fifth man looked just about right. 

He stood up. “Excuse me, can 

32 



you tell me the way to the latrine?’’ 

“Huh?’’ Clonk! 

He used smelly strips from his 
clothes to bind and gag the uncon- 
scious soldier and tossed him into 
the nearest bin. He carefully cov- 
ered the man with enough trash so 
he couldn’t be seen. Dal didn’t 
know how long the trooper would 
be out, but he wasn’t going to do 
much moving when he did wake 
up. 

So far, so good! He’d gotten into 
the camp, obtained a uniform, and 
was now anonymous. 

Time to start looking around. 

★ 

Three hours later. Dal was con- 
vinced Emba hadn’t been lying. 
Even if this was the only base 
Hookthom had — and he doubted 
that — ^there were at least two 
thousand ships, along with all the 
support equipment and personnel 
needed to keep the small navy oper- 
ational. He’d only had one close 
call — when an officer stopped him 
and told him to get a bath — 
apparently some of the garbage’s 
odor had remained with him. 

He worked his way toward the 
center of the complex. Everything 
had the look of newness and mili- 
tary drab about it. The pre-fab plas- 
tic buildings glinted dully in the 
harsh sunlight. Another few min- 
utes, and he’d have the place pretty 
well scoped out. He plann^ to 
swi^ something movable then and 
hop the fence — that was much more 
appealing than burrowing into the 
gunk again and waiting for the trash 
carrier. 

He walked nonchalantly through 
GALAXY 




the area, between the neutral gray 
walls. There weren’t any trees or 
bushes or color to break the bare 
ground. The hot walls gave off a 
waxy smell, and the traces of gar- 
bage he’d missed in changing 
clothes grew ranker in the afternoon 
sun. 

This was almost boring. He 
rounded a sharp comer, and — would 
you look at that! In the middle of 
all that military starkness, there was 
a — house! And not just a house, but 
a deep-red stained house. It had a 
high, peaked roof, with massive 
beams edging it, with what ap- 
peared to be split wooden shakes 
for shingles. There were several 
thin windows of heavy plastiglass 
mnning from the ground nearly to 
the roof, and a heavy, close-grained 
hardwood door near one end of the 
structure. There were bushes around 
the house, and even a ten-meter tall 
tree nearby. 

Well, well. I wonder who lives 
there? 

Slowly, Dal edged closer to the 
house. It had to be Hookthom’s. If 
he could just get a good look. 

An alarm horn blared so loudly it 
sent him jumping half a meter into 
the air. He twisted his head side- 
ways, and saw the round tube of a 
spy-eye — protruding from the bole 
of the fem-like tree. 

Damn! 

He turned and began to run. Out 
of the comer of his eye, he caught a 
glimpse of that heavy door opening. 
He kept moving, but looked back. 

His kidneys and bowels screamed 
at his brain, and he expected to see 
an armed trooper start blasting — . 

What he saw was a very tall 
woman framed in the doorway — and 



gods, what a woman! She had long, 
red hair, and was draped. in a flow- 
ing, see-through robe of emerald 
green. As if in slow-motion. Dal 
saw the middle of the gauzy mate- 
rial part, blown by some stray, hot 
breeze, to reveal the slim belly and 
legs of the woman — totally nude 
underneath! In that suddenly long 
second, he saw a thatch of thick 
and red pubic hair. 

God damn! 

Not now a tiny voice echoed in- 
side his head. Another alamn began 
screaming somewhere, and Dal 
knew he was in big trouble! 

He headed for an alley. 

And suddenly he saw the harsh, 
red lines of laser beams flare, form- 
ing a fence between the two build- 
ings. 

Why hadn’t he noticed those be- 
fore? 

He skidded to a stop just short of 
the deadly bars of light! They were 
too high to jump, too low to crawl 
under. 

He spun a quarter turn, and ran. 

He rounded a comer, and almost 
ran into a trooper. Dal dropped and 
rolled, and came up holding his 
ceepee spitter in both sweaty hands. 
He fired, and the stream speared the 
trooper. The man fell, his own 
weapon discharging harmlessly into 
the ground. 

Back! Go back, around the 
house! 

As he ran by, he saw the woman, 
still standing in the doorway. She 
was smiling, her too-red lips glow- 
ing wetly in the hot sunlight. 

Dal circled the house quickly — 
and found himself facing two more 
troopers. 

They fired, and his jump was a 

33 



STAR WARRIORS 




fraction of a second too slow. He 
felt the bum of an energy beam 
along his left shoulder. Then he was 
rolling and shooting wildly. He got 
off four short bursts — one took a 
trooper in the groin, another the 
second man in the chest. 

Up! Up! Move, dammit! 

Another building. Maybe he 
could — no. More lasers! 

He turned back. Where — ?” 

“WE HAVE THE PERIMETER 
SECURED!’’ roared an amplified 
voice from a hidden loudspeaker. 
“THE INTRUDER IS STILL IN- 
SIDE. WE HAVE THREE MEN 
DOWN.’’ 

Trapped! Dal’s mind scrabbled 
over itself, trying to think and not 
panic. 

The house! It was his only 
chance. The red-head, she had to be 
the Lady Ursula. If he could take her 
hostage—. 

But the door was shut, now. 
Frantically, Dal fired his spitter at 
the wood. It would bum — . 

Too late, he realized the thick 
wood was backed with metal — 
probably hull-steel — and so, imper- 
vious to his particle weapon — ! 

The windows were too narrow, 
even if he could bum through in 
time. 

There wasn’t any cover, no place 
to hide — ! 

“ALL PERSONNEL VACATE 
THE ENCLOSURE! CLONE- 
DRONE APPROACHING ! ’ ’ 

Oh, shit! 

Dal heard the high-pitched whine 
of the aircraft, there to his right. 
He crouched, and point-shot the 
spitter. The thin green stream 
looked frail as it lanced out and 
touched the drone. 



He gulped and dived to his left, 
hitting the burned shoulder. 

The drone’s laser roasted the 
ground where he’d just been — he 
could smell the cooked earth. 

He rolled and fired again, holding 
the stud down, playing the 
charged-particles over the armor of 
the small, saucer-shaped craft. 

The drone’s laser flashed redly 
again, barely missing. As he 
dodged, he could feel the heat. 

llie drone pulled away in a lazy 
half-circle, and started back down. 

He centered the sights of his spit- 
ter on the shining metal hull and 
held the stud, held it, held it. 

And his pistol blinked out, dry, 
empty! 

He was doomed, a dead man! He 
stood up and screamed, “Fuck 
you!’’ and threw the useless spitter 
at the drone. 

And at the last second, the drone 
pulled out of its bullet-like power 
dive, and instead of a burning laser, 
a small missile erupted from its 
belly. It hit five meters away from 
Dal and exploded with a roar. 

The force kicked Dal in the face 
like a giant boot, and the world 
blossomed red and faded away.

THE-SUPER-DUPER- 

MAKE-YOUR-OWN-BABY- 

IN-A-TEST-TUBE-GANG 



The problem of test-tube babies 
is nothing compared to the problem 
of test-tube mothers . ! 



By GUYANNE KUCERA 

The grant came through on 
^ril 5th and Dr. Fitzsimmons 
immediately chose the project's 
working team: Dr. Barrows, a 
longtime colleague (fussy but pre- 
cise); Drew Adams, her lab as- 
sistant (a bit abrasive but with 
intuitive solutions); Cassie Page, 
a prorriising university student; 
and Clive Dieter, good at theory 
and a genuine talent for smooth- 
ing troubles. 

The donors, all interns or stu- 
dents, had already contributed 
sperm and egg to the experi- 
ment, but before the actual im- 
plantation and viability started, 
the first thing on the agenda was 
the simple matter of a container. 

“How about a glass test tube, 
only larger?” was the first 
suggestion. 

This comment was met with 



shivers and negative headshakes 
as nuances of Brave New 
Worlds were hoped to be 
avoided. 

“Too hard.” 

“Too cold and inflexible.” 
“Doesn’t block light.” 

Dr. Fitzsimmon’s voice cut 
through the turmoil, “One of the 
new stretch polymers should do 
nicely. The opacity would limit 
the light.” 

Clive agreed, “If we pack the 
inner bundle in a bed of foam 
there would be just the right 
amount of pressure surrounding 
the fetus and it should also help 
regulate the temperature.” 

“And pray tell how are we 
going to see into this' dark and 
tepid atmosphere?” This from the 
fastidtous Dr. Barrows, whose 
voice conjured an amazingly ac- 



35 




curate vision of a nattily dressed 
little man forever straightening 
his bow tie. 

"We could use one of the new 
heat emission cameras. It’d pick 
up the warm areas of the body 
and give us a fairly reliable visual 
picture. Along with the EKG 
monitoring system, we should be 
immediately alerted to anything if 
it went wrong.” 

“And what if someone runs 
into the bloody thing?” 

Everyone but Dr. Fitzsimmons, 
who was aware of the seeming- 
ness of Adams casual attitude, 
was horrified. The bloody thing 
indeed. Clive broke the awkward 
silence; “Adams is right. We'll 
have to create something around 
the whole works for protection.” 

They all nodded, their minds 
diverted from Adams back to the 
problem at hand. 

“How about a plastic cast? It 
could be in the same shape as a 
human pelvis and be sectional to 
facilitate delivery.” 

At these last words a small 
smile flickered from person to 
person, except for Adams, who 
was silently measuring the hips 
of Cassie Page. 

★ 

Having decided fhis would be 
the best artificial environment 
possible, they spent the next few 
weeks working out the kinks. The 
end result ended up looking a lot 
like a huge sponge with myriad 
tubes ana wires leading into it; If 
it was the closest approximation 
of a womb man could devise, it 
was in no way visually comparable. 

36 



So the solutions were mixed, 
the container filled, the wires 
hooked up, the temperatures 
obtained, and the beautiful ex- 
periment began. 

The five of them stood looking 
at the strange apparatus in the 
middle of the room. Besides the 
heat emissions of the visual 
screen, they had hooked up an 
ewnplifier so they could hear the 
fetal heartbeat. 

Cassie listened to the sound. 
“You know, I just thought of 
something. If we can hear it, it 
must also be able to hear.” 

Adams was quick to reply, 
“With all that stuffing around it? 
Hardly.’ 

She glared at him. “I mean, it 
can hear it’s mother’s heartbeat. 
Probably can even feel vibration 
at this stage.” 

“She’s right,” Clive assured 
them. “An infant can detect it’s 
mother’s heartbeat at a very 
early age. It may even have 
something to do with the regula- 
tion of their own heart rhythms. 
Or it may be a security producing 
support system.” 

“Well”, Barrows said. “What 
should we do?” 

Adams glanced around, bored. 
“Why not just throw a clock in 
the hatch?” 

Again he was met with general 
pandemonium. 

Or. Fitzsimmons quieted the 
group. “Adams may have a 
point. We could feed in a re- 
cording. As the fetus develops, it 
will be conditioned to an actual 
adult heart beat. 

“Now”, she surveyed the 
group “Whose heartbeat shall we 



GALAXY 




record?” 

Cassie muttered, "Not Adams, 
his only goes dick-whirr.” 

“No,’’ Dr. Fitzsimmons agreed. 
"It probably should be a female. 
I’m past child-bearing age, so I 
guess you'd be more ideal.” 
Cassie smiled and nodded. “I’d 
be glad to make a recording.” 
Clive objected, “Not just a re- 
cording. Cassie, an endless 
tape.” 

They all looked at him 
questioningly. 

“A recording would be a repe- 
tition of the same beat. You all 
know heartbeats change through- 
out the day with stress, excitement 
or exertion. Cassie should record 
one day, then start a new tape 
the next day as the first one is 
fed into the life support system.” 
Barrows was becoming ex- 
cited. “Of course. The baby will 
be receiving the real reactions of 
human heartbeats going through 
an actual day.” 

“Well, Cassie,” Dr. Fitzsim- 
mons glanced at her. “Are you 
still game?” 

Cassie looked a little doubtful 
but nodded. “Should I take it off 
at night?” 

“No.” Barrows maintained. 
“Expectant mother's hearts beat 
in bed too. We must have an 
authentic recording in every way. 
That means we should have ev- 
erything, even the heartbeat 
slowing down for sleep.” 

“Or speeding up,” Adams in- 
jected, looking at Cassie’s rather 
full figure, “Expectant mothers 
are known for doing other things 
in bed besides sleeping.” 

With this, the group was 



thrown into discord and dis- 
missed for the evening. Dr. Fitz- 
simmons set about wiring Cassie 
to give her fairly complete free- 
dom, yet make the equipment 
readily accessible. 

★ 

During the following months, 
the tapes were switched each 
morning and fed into the fetal 
bath with only one mishap, when 
Adams accidentally (?) mixed up 
the tape and fed iri a cassette of 
“Early Katies Hits”. 

Clive, while monitoring the fetal 
heartbeat, noticed his foot tap- 
ping and finally recognized the 
tune. 

"You’ve probably blown his ear 
drums.” 

“Aw, just getting him into the 
swing of things.” 

Dr. Fitzsimmons briskly changed 
the tapes and shook her headf. “I 
hate to admit it, but in a way 
Adams is right again. Even an 
unborn child is influenced by his 
surroundings. We’ve provided 
nourishment, and rhythm but no 
movement. A pregnant woman, 
even confined to bed, would 
have some movement. 

Clive looked doubtfully at the 
huge container and all the sur- 
rounding paraphernalia. “Maybe 
we could arrange a sling from 
the ceiling and lift it off the floor 
enough to swing it back and 
forth.” 

“Better yet,” Adams injected, 
“put springs on the bottom and 
we could all get on top and pogo 
the little bugger all over the 
room.” 



37 




“That does it.” Barrows re- 
moved his lab coat, carefully 
folded it and placed it on a chair. 

Clive stepped between them, 
helping Barrows put his jacket 
back on. "Let’s sleep on it for to- 
niaht.” 

"^‘That won’t do anything but 
flatten its little head,’’ Adams 
muttered. 

This time Clive nearly yanked 
the coat off Barrows. 

Once again Dr. Fitzsimmons 
stepped in. “One problem at a 
time, please. We’ll want move- 
ment in all directions.” 

Barrows agreed, “And a 
motorized propulsion system.” 

“We could even take it out- 
side,” Cassie added. “Perhaps to 
the park across the street.” 

■’We’d need an elevator sys- 
tem. Maybe retractable ramps for 
getting up and down curbs,” 
Clive add^. 

It was quiet for a second as 
they all looked at Adams expec- 
tantly. 

“And one hell of an extension 
cord.” 

Four pairs of eyes flew sky- 
ward. 

★ 

The next few days were spent 
reinforcing the outer shell, adding 
an elevator system, shelves for 
the monitoring equipment and a 
portable generator. By now the 
structure had grown to encom- 
pass half of the room and to get 
’baby’ out for his walk, the door 
and part of the wall had to be 
removed. 

In the following weeks, the 



people in the park nervously an- 
ticipated the sight of a huge box 
exiting from the science building 
across the way followed by five 
people in lab coats: a small 
white-haired woman who led the 
group; a skinny long-haired lad 
who, with another mustached 
man, ran about checking dials 
and wires; a dark girl wearing a 
warm smile, and a tall fair lad 
with his arm around her, whis- 
pering to her and tapping on 
what appeared to be a mike 
taped on her neck. 

Finally the day came when Dr. 
Fitzsimmons summoned them all 
to meet for the last time. “Our 
experiment has come to its con- 
clusion. I would like to thank 
each and every one of you for 
your cooperation, your ideas and 
your time. You have all proved 
invaluable to this project. The 
fetus is full term and will now be 
transferred to the hospital for 
birth.” 

Cassie’s long face looked 
close to tears. “We should have 
the birth here.” 

"No Cassie.” It was one of the 
few times Dr. Fitzsimmons voice 
lost its professional touch. “We 
don’t have the facilities or 
equipment in case something 
should go wrong. You know that, 
dear.” 

“But it’s our child.” 

The voice regained its firm- 
ness, “It was our project Cassie, 
but never our child. If we kept 
him, he would be a curiosity with 
five parents.” 

“He’d be a hit at father and 
son banquets.” 

Fitzsimmons ignored Adams 



38 



GALAXY 




and continued. "This way he will 
be adopted by parents who know 
nothing of his gestation. He will 
be just another ordinary child.” 

They all nodded agreement. 

“But I wanted a baby.” Cassie 
murmured. 

Adams poked her gently in the 
ribs, “Stick with me kid. I know 
how to go about it.” 

Cassie looked at him and then 
started to laugh. The others fol- 
lowed suit, tremendously pleased 
at their accomplishment; a team 
at last. 

★ 

Dr. ntzsimmons sat alone, 
putting the final touches on her 
notes and slowly surveying her 
surroundings. She had lost a 
promising student, who had quit 
to have a child. 

The same student had married 



and mellowed a prize lab assis- 
tant, so he would probably lose 
his abrasiveness and be useless 
in future projects; half a wall of 
the lab was gone and the rest 
was cluttered with wires, tubing, 
sheet metal, plastic and machin- 
ery; a year had passed as if by 
magic; the people in the park 
had organize and were picket- 
ing the lab for scaring them out 
of their wits; and to top it all, she 
had post-partum blues. 

She glanced down at the title 
on the report before her: 
“Feasibility Studies On The 
Perfect Environment For The 
Gestation Of A Fetus.” 

She picked up a red pen, 
turned to the last page and be- 
side the heading of Suggestions, 
scribbled in large capital letters:

FEMWORLD; 

before the revolution 
A. E. VAN VOGT 



A great writer’s nightmare 
vision of Women’s lib gone mad! 



Peter Grayson, Ph.D., physi- 
cist, vice-president of Haskett Man- 
ufacturing Laboratories, Inc., heard 
the peculiar tiny clicking sound 
twice in rapid order. 

Ping . ping. 

The print he was reading blurred. 

Grayson shook his head impa- 
tiently and drew the contract closer 
to his glasses. Spots danced over 
the page. He sighed and closed his 
eyes. When he opened them again, 
he saw the problem. 

In each lens of his spectacles, 
there was a crack horizontally 
across the “glass” exactly at pupil 
level. 

He was startled. Both lenses bro- 
ken within a half-second of each 
other. Being statistically oriented, 
he considered the probability of si- 
multaneous breakage. The figures 
that leaped to his mind were as- 
tronomical, and of course impossi- 



ble. He gave it up. 

Silently, now, he removed the 
derelict spectacles, and laid them on 
the desk. Next, he searched in one 
of the drawers, and found a spool 
of hansparent tape — naturally, man- 
ufactured by Haskett Laboratories. 
Obviously, he would use it only 
until he could obtain a new pair. 

He replaced the tape in the desk, 
the glassess on his nose — as the 
door opened and Miss Haskett 
walked in. 

It was her usual vital entrance. 
She smiled, and said, “Do you 
have a moment. Doctor Grayson?” 
Her repertoire gone, she sank onto a 
chair and waited with an air of 
death. 

Grayson studied the owner of the 
Haskett Laboratories from behind 
his glasses and an astonishing 
thought passed through his mind. 
He ought to feel guilty about Miss 



40 



GALAXY 




Haskett. Her lonely life cried out 
wordlessly for love and affection. 
And who should answer that call 
but the man she had confirmed as 
chief scientist when she had inher- 
ited the business from her late aunt? 
Theirs was an office relationship. 
But it had involved most of her 
adult life. 

Grayson cleared his throat, un- 
easy at the thoughts he was having. 
He was so intent on that he didn’t 
notice the incongruity of what he 
did next. 

He said, “Uh, Miss Haskett.” 

What he did not realize was the 
assertiveness of his tone. As if he 
were the employer, and she the em- 
ployee. And she was evidently not 
thinking either, or was daydream- 
ing. For she said in an absent tone; 
‘‘Yes, Doctor?” 

‘‘What’s the name of the eye 
specialist we use for our m^e 
, staff?” 

“Burr. Doctor Burr.” 

His thought shifted back ^o Miss 
Haskett. “What do you do in your 
spare time?” he asked. 

‘‘Oh — various things.” She 

seemed alert, suddenly. 

‘‘Do you read?” 

‘‘Sometimes. ” 

‘‘Go to the movies?” 

‘‘Occasionally. ” 

Grayson hesitated. An awareness 
was coming about what he was do- 
ing: Asking personal questions of 
his employer. He had not done that 
in all their previous association. He 
was startled. 

Inside him, the withdrawal pro- 
cess was beginning. 

At this point the woman volun- 
teered, ‘‘I live in a condominium 
complex.” 



Grayson was startled by the im- 
port of the information. “Alone?” 
he asked. 

Color came into her cheeks. She 
straightened. Then: “Alone,” she 
said firmly. And did not look at 
him. 

Grayson was silent. She had de- 
liberately roused herself out of 
thirty-eight years of shyness to tell 
him that she had the facilities for an 
affair. 

Grayson sighed. He was married, 
however drably. And he couldn’t 
take the risk of his analysis being 
wrong. It would be ridiculous if he 
lost his job or got his face slapped, 
or — worst of all — was hauled before 
an Utt commissioner. 

Thinking of that, shaken by that, 
he said urgently; “Miss Haskett, I 
seem to have damaged my specta- 
cles. And I’m sure I don’t have to 
tell you that for a male nothing is 
more important. So if you’ll just 
hold what you were going to tell 
me — ” 

Haskett stood up. “It can wait.” 
Suddenly brisk, vital again, she 
added, “Why don’t I have Miss 
Broman call Dr. Burr, and make an 
appointment?” 

“Uh, thank you.” He spoke 
absent-mindedly because he was 
watching Miss Haskett as she went 
to the door. It occurred to him for 
the first time in their long business 
life that she had an excellent figure. 

As the door closed, he realized 
that he had a forbidden male-type 
feeling; and that he should be ex- 
periencing strong guilt reactions. 

But what he actually felt was a 
fear of being found out. 

Trembling, he sat there in his 
private office in the scientific ad- 



FEMWORLD 



41 




ministrative section of Haskett 
Laboratories and began to feel bet- 
ter, because he decided that he was 
not really in danger. The dialogue 
of Miss Haskett and himself was 
gone into that voiceless universe 
of all the forgotten — because un- 
recorded — conversations between 

people. 

She lives alone with her servants, 
he thought. So she will never men- 
tion it. 

And I won’t. 

His anxiety began to fade. 

His momentary lapse was behind 
him, receding further into the past 
with each instant. 

He suspected what had happened 
had to do with the cracked lens of 
his spectacles. 

The possibility was genuinely 
amazing to Grayson. Could it be 
that the Utt females were 
right? . On their arrival on earth 
forty years before, the matriarchal 
Utt had surveyed the human condi- 
tion, and had diagnosed that the 
problems of mankind were all trace- 
able to the male. 

From the height of total superior- 
ity, their female rulers decreed that 
every male must take a certain drug 
at puberty. This drug rendered the 
male nearsighted. 

Whereupon, qualified profession- 
als, following Utt specifications, fit- 
ted men with spectacles. Something 
must have been in them. Because 
the lens, it was said, barred tiny 
portions of the visible spectrum 
from stimulating the male optic 
nerve. 

Aside from requiring that all 
property be owned by women, plus 
certain transport limitations, and 
that women were not allowed to 



take scientific training — an unex- 
plained restriction — that was the 
only direct Utt female interference 
in human affairs. 

What bothered Grayson was that 
he had secretly dismissed the Utt 
analysis. He rejected, in short, the 
Utt concept that men were the vil- 
lains of earth’s tormented history. It 
all seemed far-fetched — made up. 

Suddenly, he wasn’t so sure. 

He was still thinking about it 
when Miss Haskett knocked and en- 
tered. An unfortunate thing occur- 
red. She gave him information 
about his appointment. But Grayson 
heard only the sound, none of the 
words. 

He was intently observing the 
fact she was a good-looking wom- 
an. Absorbed, he watched her leav- 
ing the room. It was only after she 
was gone that he wondered, what 
did she say? 

He was alarmed. The situation 
which he had thought solved, had 
had an unsuspected aftereffect. It 
could — it seemed — repeat with each 
visual contact. 

It occurred to Grayson there was 
a simple solution. He must avoid 
seeing, particularly Miss Haskett, 
X but possibly all women — until he 
had his new lenses. 

Satisfied, he clicked on the inter- 
com. “Miss Broman, will you re- 
peat that about my appointment 
with Dr. Burr?’’ The appointment 
was for the next day. Miss Broman 
added quickly, “And Dr. 
Grayson — ’’ 

“Yes?” 

“Miss Haskett asked me to tell 
you that the address of her con- 
dominium is 1818 Mendelian 
Drive. ’’

ONE LITTLE PLANET 



R. M. Meluch 



In a universe where Earthmen and Uelsons battled for control 
of galaxies, what chance did Arana have for survival? But not 
only was this seemingly backward planet a fuel stop for space 
warriors — it harbored a new race of men, and the key to the 
ultimate struggle between mankind and man’s most hated 
enemy.

Long pause. Finally: “Uh, Miss 
Broman, cancel my appointments 
for the day,” Grayson croaked. 
“And tell Miss Haskett I’m going 
home this afternoon. I don’t feel 
well. I’ll go t>y the rear exit.” 

After a while, he was pleased to 
realize that he had kept his wits 
about him. First, deciding so 
promptly to go home, and, second, 
going out the sidedoor, he would 
evade passing Miss Haskett’s office. 

On the bus — one of the Utt trans- 
port limitations was men were not 
allowed to drive; an automobile was 
considered by the Utt females to be 
a violence potential instrument — he 
realized that his situation was not 
good at all. In his mind’s ear, he 
kept hearing the seductive female 
sweetness in Miss Broman ’s voice. 

One hope remained. After the 
lenses were repaired, his ability to 
hear the female voice with such re- 
sponsive sensitivity would diminish 
again. 

In short, he would cease to be 
vulnerable to the unsuspected mad- 
ness which, he realized, had been 
lurking inside his skin exactly as the 
Utt females had unerringly observed 
in human males at the time of their 
arrival on earth. 

★ 

Mila, his wife, was not in when 
Grayson entered the house. Which 
surprised him vaguely. He’d always 
had the impression that she never 
went anywhere during the day. 

Probably out shopping, he 
thought. Satisfied, he put considera- 
tion of his wife out of his mind. 

He went straight to his bedroom, 
placed his glasses away in his night 

44 



table, and lay down. Utt law re- 
quired a man. to wear eyeglasses 
even while in bed — but, obviously, 
to do so with broken lenses would 
be tempting further damage to 
them, so ... 

He slept. And awakened to a dis- 
tant door opening and shutting. 
Mila, he presumed. There was si- 
lence. He pictured her looking at 
his hat and cane in the hall, aware 
that he was home. He visualized her 
instant unpleasant reaction. 

But it was an hour before the 
door opened, and the rather tall, but 
slightly stooped woman who had 
been his wife for over thirty long 
years, came in and stood over him. 

“And what is it now?" she said 
in her attacking tone. 

It was eight years since his last 
illness and twenty-two years back to 
the time he had stayed home after 
hurting his hip in a severe fall — and 
in each instance he had remained in 
bed exactly one day. Yet he per- 
ceived that in her mind the interven- 
ing years were nothing compared to 
the mental anguish of his unwanted 
presence during those two twenty- 
four hour periods. 

For the ftrst time he had a glim- 
mer of the enormous effect the Utt 
had had on wives. When man had 
been named as the Earth’s 
trouble-maker, every woman be- 
came Ms. Unchallengeable. 

Hastily, Grayson described his 
glasses breaking — then became 
aware of a strong chemical odor. 
He wrinkled his nose in distaste. 

Atr amazing thing happened. His 
wife’s shadowy figure, which had 
towered above him, sank down. 
Though it was difficult to see, 
Grayson had the impression that his 



GALAXY 




wife was on her knees beside the 
bed. 

And the odor was — if (jossible — 
even stronger. 

Grayson sat up. “Mila! What’s 
the matter?” 

“Don’t hurt me!” It was a whis- 
per. 

What stopped all immediate re- 
sponse by Grayson — his impulse to 
leap out of bed, his confusion, his 
feeling he must instantly go to her 
aid for some reason that wasn’t 
clear — was the realization that the 
odor was a human body smell. 

Mila’s! 

Memory wafted a startling expla- 
nation from his early laboratory ex- 
periments with animals. A female 
animal in heat had several times af- 
fected him unpleasantly. So much 
so that, finally, realizing that glan- 
dular exudations were actually too 
much for his sensitive nose, he had 
abandoned his primary interest in 
biology, and had gone over to the 
objective world of physics. 

This smell now was like that 
animal smell then. 

A woman in a profound state of 
sexual stimulation — 

He lay back . She sees I'm not 
wearing the glasses that keep a man 
tamed, he thought. 

Because his brain worked rapidly, 
he waited, curious. If he told her 
after such a delay, there was no 
knowing what berserk state she 
would go into. 

Then, he recalled the theory of 
such matters. A few minutes after a 
man took off his glasses, their ef- 
fect wore off. His experience with 
Miss Haskett had certainly proved 
that. 

He was assuming, of course, that 



broken lenses were the equivalent of 
no-glasses — 

A male without glasses, said the 
legend, became progressively more 
aggressive, unreasoning, capable of 
violence. 

To Mila, after an afternoon of no 
glasses, he must seem to be in some 
final stage of male insanity. 

For Grayson, it was startling — he 
realized how strongly women of the 
old days must have responded to 
their men. 

The woman beside the bed spoke 
again, in a whisper. "What do you 
want? I’ll do anything you say. 
Don’t hurt me.” 

“Take a bath,” said Grayson, 
wrinkling his nose again, “and of 
course you won’t be hurt as long 
as — ” he hesitated, startled by his 
own temerity, but the words came 
involuntarily — “as long as you do 
what I say.” 

The woman came to her feet with 
alacrity. Her walk was not steady. 
There was the somewhat prolonged 
moment when she opened the door 
itself. Then the door closed. 

Her bedroom was on the far side 
of the house, a choice of location 
she had made long ago. He as- 
sumed that she would now have 
time to recover her good sense. He 
recalled, uneasily, that a woman 
who felt herself threatened by a 
man could ask for instant help. 

Yet when the door to his room 
opened again, he wasn’t sure what 
state she was in. She wore her robe; 
that he was able to detect even with 
his weak vision. But — what else 
was not clear. 

She came over to the bed, took 
off her robe, and lay down naked 
beside him. For long moments the 



FEMWORLD 



45 




surprise of that was a blankness. 
Then he felt himself automatically 
resisting. 

For this woman, there was no re- 
sponse in him. Thirty years of 
abuse tightened his heart, and put a 
cold lump in ^is gut — Grayson was 
surprised at the intensity of his re- 
sistance. Normally, he didn’t feel 
this strongly. He recognized that he 
was aware for the first time of his 
true feeling. 

I could probably strangle this 
woman, he bought. 

That shocked him. Male violence 
really does exist, he admitted to 
himself. 

He fleetingly recalled their sexual 
past. Several times each year, Mila 
would go out with some female 
companions, and they would all get 
drunk. About two A.M. she would 
show up, an obscene creature with a 
tendency to throw-up, and demand 
that he engage in sex. 

Naturally, and anxiously, he had 
always come through while she 
laughed, belched, and on occassion 
spat in his face. 

In the morning, she showed no 
apparent memory of the event. 

— But he didn’t want her at such 
times, and he didn’t want her now. 

‘ ‘Has Rosie said when dinner will 
be ready?” Grayson asked stiffly. 

“She said we could eat any time 
we wanted,” came a small voice 
from the bed. 

“Oh!” said Grayson. He lay for 
a long moment, bracing himself. 
Then he got off the bed, turned on 
the light, went around to the night 
table drawer, got his glasses, put 
them on, and walked to the door. 

There he paused, turned. “Better 
get dressed,” he said gruffly, “and 

46 



let’s eat.” 

He went out into the hall. 

★ 

By the time they sat down at the 
table, his wife’s sallow face was 
red. She stared at her plate and did 
not look at him. That was disap- 
pointing. He was — he had to admit 
it — curious. 

The truth was, he realized, he 
was ignorant and distrustful of Utt 
judgments, and craved information 
on which to form his own conclu- 
sions. 

On the surface, it looked like men 
had caused all the problems. Be- 
cause, after the Utt came, women 
changed. 

A married woman, unpursued by 
her husband, was . normal- 
ly .. not interested in sex. There 
were reports (from certain salesmen) 
of exceptions. But the ordinary situ- 
ation was drab. Usually a wife 
would have a child or two — no 
more. Since only women were al- 
lowed to own projDerty, married 
women lived confidently. Grayson 
brought home a good salary from 
his job, all of which he handed over 
by law. She had household help. 
Her clothes and house were always 
neat, clean, and she herself 
wellgroomed. Sane, healthy, stable, 
she was the embodiment of a high 
standard of human being. 

Except for one thing: the average 
wife was as easily angered after the 
Utt came as before. Only now she 
really felt free to express it. It was 
the one disturbing factor in a world 
where men were hard-working, 
peaceful, and kept sexually apathet- 
ic by a physiological method that 



GALAXY 




was the law of the planet. For an 
unknown reason men in such a con- 
dition were never angry — 

There was a sound at the other 
end of the table. Grayson’s mind 
jumped out of its reverie. Mila was 
glaring at him. She spoke sharply, 
“Why weren’t you wearing your 
glasses in the bedroom?’’ 

He explained about not wanting 
to damage the cracked lens. “But 
of course, I kept my eyes closed. I 
was very careful not to upset the 
internal balance.” 

“Oh!” Some of the color faded 
from her cheeks and her lips com- 
pressed. The old signal of an immi- 
nent flare-up. He spoke hastily, try- 
ing to head off the explosion. 

“What you did,” he said, “tells 
us a great deal about pre-Utt rela- 
tions.” 

There was a noticeable relaxing 
of anger as she said, “How do you 
mean?” 

“Evidently, women offered sex 
to men out of fear. ’ ’ 

“What are you talking about?” 
The sharpness was back. 

That startled him. Was she pre- 
tending? Or was it possible she 
didn’t remember? 

Forgetfulness. Blankness. Her old 
pattern. As if it hadn’t happened? 
That could be it. 

But he was still curious, he re- 
alized, therefore frustrated. 

“Has the fear faded?” he asked. 
She had the expression of some- 
one who intended to deny it. Then; 
“It was strange,” she said, a fara- 
way look in her eyes. “I suppose I 
should go to see the doctor.” 

Terror could have a profound 
physiological effect, Grayson pre- 
sumed, correlat&d with shock. 



“There I was,” his wife con- 
tinued, “suddenly faint and half- 
hallucinating.” She added a ridicul- 
ing laugh. “I actually fantasized 
myself taking off my clothes, then 
coming into your bed, naked.” She 
laughed again, and made an angry 
gesture with one shoulder. “A re- 
gression to my child-bearing state. 
We’ve had our children and our re- 
ason for copulating is twenty-five 
years behind us.” 

So it was going to be forgetful- 
ness and denial, Grayson thought. 

How amazing! In their courtship 
days, she had pursued him like a 
sex demon. The vitality she offered 
promised his enforced apathy would 
be completely overwhelmed by her 
inexhaustible need. Before mar- 
riage, she forced sex as often as 
three times a day. Afterwards — 
Two days after the ceremony 
that, by Utt law, bound them to- 
gether forever, Mila let him know 
that marriage was for com- 
panionship and bearing children. 

Probably, gentler women like 
Miss Haskett lost out in the struggle 
for marriage because they were in- 
capable of the insane premarital in- 
tensity which absolutely over- 
whelmed males subjected to it. 

— Too soon to decide anything 
about that. Yet he felt a hardening 
inside him, which was a decision of 
sorts, barring Mila from his life. 

After dinner Grayson went back 
to bed, and in his fantasies vis- 
ualized Miss Haskett in various exot- 
ic maneuvers. There was a thought 
in his mind that said there was no 
danger now of being found out. 

He could stand it no longer. He 
dressed and went out. His wife was 
sitting, knitting another of the in- 



FEMWORLD 



47 




terminable sweaters which she sent 
Mart, who was at college. 

“Uh,” said Grayson. 

She did not look up, which was 
par. She had ignored him most of 
their married life and she was ob- 
viously not about to change. 

“I’m going for a walk,” said 
Grayson, “perhaps you’d like to 
come?” 

That was his final hope of defeat- 
ing the urge that moved him to 
what was obviously a forbidden ad- 
venture. 

Something must have penetrated; 
she looked up, showed surprise. 
“Where are you going?” 

“For a walk,” he said. 

“Oh!” Then: “No, thank you.” 

It seemed to satisfy her, for she 
settled back to the sweater. The last 
picture he had of her was of her sit- 
ting in the chair rocking back and 
forth. 

Outside, the air was fresh, and he 
walked along with gathering confi- 
dence. A bus pulled up at the 
comer, and because he knew where 
he wanted to go, he climbed aboard 
without really considering the fu- 
ture. 

He phoned Miss Haskett from a 
drugstore. “I happened to be in the 
neighborhood,” he said, “and 
wondered if you’d care for coffee.” 

She sounded breathless. “Why, 
yes, Mr. Grayson. I — ” She broke 
off. “Why don’t you come up to 
my place?” She said, suddenly. 
“I’ll have Joanne put the coffee on. 
No, I’ll put it on.” 

When he got there he had no 
problem. Large trees, dim lights. 
An ideal place. From where 
Grayson stood on the porch, he 
could not see the entrances of the

adjoining apartments. 

A single buzz was answered in- 
stantly. A vision in white stood in 
the doon\ ay. 

‘it’s nice of you to drop by, Mr. 
Grayson,” she said. 

Grayson blinked. It seemed to 
him she had made a quick change 
since his call. Or else he had mis- 
judged this whole situation. “Were 
you on the way out?” he asked. 

“Oh, no, I always dress up for 
myself at night,” said Miss Has- 
kett. 

She held the door wider. Grayson 
walked in. 

They drank coffee. Silence fell. 
She sat, empty cup in hand, on the 
couch. The long skirt of her dress 
was drawn up primly against the 
leg nearest him. Grayson placed his 
own cup and saucer on the coffee 
table, and took a deep breath. It 
was either time to go or time to do. 

His heart pounded, his eyes blur- 
red behind the mended glasses. He 
found himself reluctantly agreeing; 
men really were the villains. He 
was clearly in a state of raging de- 
sire. 

Abruptly that shamed him. Un- 
steadily, he came to his feet. 
“Uh,” he said, “uh. Miss Haskett, 
1 want to thank you for this 
delightful — ” 

At that point, she set her cup 
down so quickly it hit the table and 
fell forcefully on its side in the 
saucer. 

The sound was startlingly loud in 
what had been intense silence. Both 
the man and the woman involuntar- 
ily leaned forward to straighten the 
cup. His head brushed lightly 
against her hair. It was not red 
physical contact, but in his whole 



adult life, Grayson had only 
touched one other woman. And she 
had made that such misery — and so 
rare, that he no longer wanted to 
touch her. 

It was several decades since he 
had been close to a desirable wom- 
an. His hand reached for hers, al- 
most knocked the cup over 
again — but got hold of her fingers. 
Then he tugged her along from be- 
hind the coffee table. 

It was a long coffee table and by 
the time he had her, his 
consciousness — conscience — surfaced 
He let go. 

“Very delightful,” he muttered 
gloomily, stepping back, “but I 
imagine I’d better — ” 

^£ss Haskett caught his sleeve. 
“You must see the rest of my 
home.” 

Grayson stiffened inside, he was 
a supremely analytical person and 
he saw this as a gesture goodwill 
on her part. They toured the fluffy, 
very feminine makeup room. She 
explained things ateut it that 
Grayson did not hear because he 
was bracing himself. She took him 
into a huge bathroom. Special fea- 
tures required Miss Haskett to con- 
tinue chattering. He did not hear 
what those special features were. 
Something about an unusual method 
of maintaining the bath water 
exactly at blood heat . got 
through to him. 

And that one he promptly forgot 
as they came to a closed door. 
Grayson never remembered af- 
terwards who opened that door. Did 
he leap forward or was he frozen in 
his singletrack thought — feeling — 
intent? 

Whichever — the door was 



FEMWORLD 



49 




opened. The bedroom, large and 
expensive. Fluffy feminine atmo- 
sphere. A queen-size bed he couldn't 
help noticing. 

Then they were standing beside 
it. Her voice, which had been virtu- 
ally unceasing — ceased. 

“Where’s the light switch?” 
Grayson asked into the sudden si- 
lence. 

“Over there.” She pointed. 

“Do you mind?” asked Grayson. 

“Over there,” she said, voice 
coming up in pitch, a stricken 
sound in it. 

★ 

In the darkness, Grayson encoun- 
tered the nude form of Miss Has- 
kett, enthralled. Moments glided 
by. Body touched body. Lip pressed 
lip. Moments lengthened to sec- 
onds, seconds to minutes. Grayson 
told himself that Miss Haskett was 
in a class by herself. Most impor- 
tant, she was accepting him without 
any apparent reservation. Which, he 
had to admit, was pretty tolerant. 

After all, she was offering him a 
nubile, slender, well-formed, good- 
looking body. In return, she was 
having imposed upon her a spare, 
gaunt male type with an aging face 
which fortunately was hidden in the 
darkness. Still, she must know what 
it looked like, and had made her 
peace with it. 

He decided to tell her how grate- 
ful he was for her goodwill. He re- 
moved his lips from hers, intending 
to make the non-kissing extremely 
brief, just long enough to say a few 
kind words that would fit the occa- 
sion. 

Momentarily, he paused. And, 



because he was always careful in 
his use of English, the moment 
grew long. And, abruptly, the awful 
realization that his gratitude had 
diverted him and he was in serious 
danger of losing his abiliry to per- 
form the act. Instantly desperate, he 
fought to save the situation. There 
was no question about that either. It 
was a fi^t. 

“What’s the matter?” Miss Has- 
kett whispered. 

What could he say? He had virtu- 
ally wrecked the moment by letting 
his mind wander to an unfortunate 
reality: he was no longer a young 
man. 

As he had that despairing realiza- 
tion, he made a final, desperate ef- 
fort to salvage the affair. And in a 
limp fashion, at first, succeeded fi- 
nally to his satisfaction with one so 
comely — and to his own surprise, 
apparently to hers. 

★ 

It was 11:32 as Grayson climbed 
aboard the bus that would take him 
home. At first, as he settled into his 
seat, the exhilaration and frustration 
of the evening alternately pulled 
him up and pushed him down. 

But somewhere during the jour- 
ney came his moment of confronta- 
tion: 

He had taken an irrevocable step. 

He waited for the shock of disas- 
ter to move through him. 

But what he felt in its place was 
irritation. He was a grown man, 
who didn’t need advice from a Utt 
female or any other living person. 

The hostile reaction stayed with 
him all the rest of the way to his 
stop.

GALAXY 




The emotion had faded a little by 
the time he entered his house. Yet 
the prospect of running into his wife 
did not really shake him. And that 
was awesome indeed. A new 
thought. The idea of a man standing 
up to a woman’s anger with anger 
of his own was . well . there 
was no clear reaction that he could 
produce. 

But he had seen her on her 
knees. No matter what happened, he 
would never forget the implications 
of that. 

Despite his strong attitude, he 
moved silently. And as he came to 
the final stretch, where there was no 
carpet, he took time to remove his 
shoes. 

After all, he argued with himself, 
why force problems where none 
need exist? 

In his bedroom, with its door 
shut, he undressed hastily and slip- 
ped into bed. As he lay there, then, 
reviewing the night’s events, he re- 
alized that he was having still 
another and different kind of 
thought. 

Part of his mind was busy 
plotting. 

He was remembering what he had 
once read in one of those “awful 
example” stories, so common in the 
magazines in the days after the Utt 
females came. 

This story had depicted a fifty- 
year-old managerial type much like 
himself. In the pre-Utt era — the 
story had stated — such a man would 
have had half a dozen mistresses by 
his age. 

Grayson found himself feeling 
blank. The story (after his near dis- 
aster) seemed untrue. Miss Haskett, 
all by herself, almost had been too 



much for him. 

Would he ever again, now that he 
knew he might fail, dare take a 
chance of disgracing himself? 

With that . moral . 
thought, he must have slept. 

★ 

The following morning Grayson 
ate breakfast alone as usual. The 
maid served him his usual meal and 
he ate hastily, worried his wife 
might get up and ask questions. 

I’m not afraid, he told himself. 
Let’s just not have problems. 

Because he’d gulped his meal, he 
could catch his regular bus with 
time to spare. 

The bus stop had its average scat- 
tering of sad looking males. Ev- 
erywhere Grayson looked reflected 
light from spectacles glinted back. 
Eyes appeared distended behind 
thick lenses. It was very shocking 
to him now, for s ome reason. 

As Grayson walked into the 
lackluster group, an automobile — 
starting from the curb fifty feet 
away pulled up opposite Grayson. 
The large, middle-aged woman in- 
side leaned through the open win- 
dow and said, “Miss Haskett sent 
me to pick you up. Dr. Grayson.” 

With unusual strength for a wom- 
an, she leaned all the way from the 
driver’s side and pushed open the 
passenger door from inside. 

Grayson was taken by surprise. 
“Miss Haskett — oh!” 

He was appalled by his em- 
ployer’s indiscretion. Many of the 
men waiting here for buses were 
neighbors. He hoped they hadn’t 
heard what the muffled voice from 
inside the car had said. As he 



FEAAWORLD 



51 




scrambled in, his one thought was 
to get on their way before another 
word was spoken. 

“Well, that was easy,” said the 
driver. Only now he spoke in a 
man’s baritone. “Welcome to the 
revolution, doctor!" 

The car moved rapidly through 
traffic, which was light at this hour, 
consisting essentially of unmarried 
women going to work. 

Grayson’s shock at realizing he 
was in the presence of a male dis- 
guised as a female — subsided. And 
he began gaining data that would 
enable him to assess his situation. 

“How long have you been driv- 
ing a car in this disguise?” he 
asked. 

“Long enough,” was the reply. 

“Never stopped for a traffic vio- 
lation?” 

“Once.” The big “woman” 
shrugged. “Had to shoot the 
officer. Too bad — ” The speaker 
broke off. “Which reminds me. 
That will be your first assignment. 
Getting yourself a pistol.” 

Grayson scarcely heard. He had 
realized that he was asking the 
wrong questions. And that, in fact, 
he had somehow been avoiding the 
crux of the matter. 

He said now, boldly, “What is 
Miss Haskett’s role in this?” 

The large, pasty face with its arti- 
ficial cosmetic coloring — to give it 
a womanly look — grinned. “You 
were at her place last night, right? 
We’ve been keeping an eye on you 
ever since we cracked your glasses 
with that high-frequency — well, 

never mind.” Again the grin. “You 
made it with her, too, didn’t you? 
That’s what I meant — welcome to 
the revolution, doctor. When a po- 

52 



tential recruit goes after a mistress 
within forty-eight hours — and has 
the gumption to carry it through — 
that’s good enough. You’re in, and 
there’s no escape. ” 

A pause. Mostly blankness. Striv- 
ing to grasp the cruel implication. 

It was painfully obvious that the 
other’s hearty, jovial way of speak- 
ing concealed a chilling determina- 
tion, which Grayson found himself 
automatically resisting. 

He drew a deep breath, after all 
he had a certain inner power. He 
was a PH.D., and a working scien- 
tist. He said, “Let’s not be too 
hasty. If you want my goodwill I 
suggest you try persuasiveness, 
and reason, and an end to threats.” 
Having spoken, he considered 
what he had said, and found it 
good. “That’s my statement,” he 
concluded. 

The driver shook his middle- 
aged, womanly head, “Sorry, Doc, 
if you’ll think about it, you’ll see 
that we can’t operate that way.” 
“You’re already talking better,” 
urged Grayson quickly. 

The man ignored his interruption, 
“We can’t operate that way because 
we’d have people who’d try to 
suck-up to the Utts. So I have to 
tell you. If we lose confidence, we 
kill you.” He added quickly, “I 
don’t have any feeling yet that we 
can’t trust you. Doc. So don’t be 
alarmed. But,” gently — “We don’t 
take chances. >^en in doubt — ” 
He made a quick gesture across his 
throat with his finger. “You see 
how that has to be, don’t you? 
You’re a logical man.” 

And still Grayson resisted. He 
was like a man who had accidently 
walked into a thieves’ hideaway. 



GALAXY 




and as they very reasonably pointed 
out, they would have to kill him 
because they couldn ’t afford to have 
an outsider know. The logic was 
perfect. He just didn’t wish to be a 
victim, or — in this instance — 

involved. 

His reverie ended abruptly as, be- 
side him, the man held out a card, 
and said, “Any time you want to 
reach us, here’s how.’’ When 
Grayson hesitated, the man shoved 
the card into his coat pocket. 

Moments after that, the car drew 
up at the curb. “There’s the Haskett 
f^tory. Okay, doc — out!’’ 

Grayson climbed out, then 
turned, and said protestingly 
“Look!—’’ 

The automobile gave a lurch. The 
“woman” leaned across the seat, 
pulled the door shut; and, as the 
machine picked up speed, waved — 

In the course of the morning, the 
receptionist put seven calls through 
to Grayson. “Dr. Pudget on the 
phone — ” she would say. Or, “The 
factory superintendant on the 
line — ” “Can you speak to the 



buyer for Reid, Leigh, and 
Ufflegay? — ’’ And of course he al- 
ways could. Because the woman 
knew very well who he talked to 
and who could be, or should be, re- 
ferred elsewhere. 

He handled each call by making 
an initial effort to calm himself, and 
each time spoke in his usual practi- 
cal fashion. 

He began to feel a lot better. 

He was aware of a hardening of 
his resolve. The truth was, he had 
been shown a way out from under 
Utt control, from under female con- 
trol. And he had experienced the 
willing feminine body of one who 
seemed to welcome his attentions. 

And both of these he would never 
forget. 

Women and Utts had oppressed 
men too long. 

Now it could be man’s turn 
again. 

There were grievances to be paid 
for; wrongs for them to atone. 

So he was a member of the rev- 
olution after all!

HOLLYWOOD — In October John Landis started THE INCREDIBLE 
SHRINKING WOMAN. This stars Lily Tomlin in the diminishing lead 
and is a very loose remake of the famous 1950s film which was 
based on Richard Matheson’s novel. The Landis-Tomlin film is a 
comedy, however, and John reports that the script is actually very 
good. Landis also directed SCHLOCK, THE KENTUCKY FRIED 
MOVIE and NATIONAL LAMPOON’S ANIMAL HOUSE. In 
SCHLOCK, he played the title role as well: a love-besmitten ape 
man. The monkey suit for that film was built by Rick Baker, who later 
built and wore the suit used throughout the remake of KING KONG; 
in THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN Rick plays a gorilla 
again. He’s determined to make this ape suit the Ultimate Gorilla 
Costume, and when last heard from, was working out with weights to 
get a more gorilla-like physique. (An in-joke that Landis wants to pull 
off; his script has a scene requiring several scientists, and he wants 
them to be played by George Pal, Gene Roddenberry, George Lucas 
and Steven Spielberg. At last report, Spielberg said he’d do it, if 
Lucas would.) 

As for Steven Spielberg, he recently visited the home of Forry 
Ackerman, who says the young director was in seventh heaven. Spiel- 
berg has a complete set of Famous Monsters of Filmland and joined 
the Monster Club when he was but a wee tyke. He told Forry that as 
of September 1st, he owned the screen rights to Ray Bradbury’s 
“Something Wicked This Way Comes.” That film has come very near 
to being made several times, most recently first by Sam Peckinpah, 
and later by Jack Clayton. Spielberg and George Lucas are planning

NEW YORK — According to the October 1 978 issue of Penthouse, last 
year readers spent over forty-five million dollars on SF books and 
magazines. That’s opposed to $1.5 million ten years ago. The total 
figure goes over two BILLION dollars, if you include movies, movie 
posters etc. These figures don't include lunch pails, dolls, blankets, 
and a host of other items with SF themes. Science Fiction is sud- 
denly big business. SF visuals have been discovered by Madison 
Avenue and are being used to sell everything from pens to panty- 
hose. 

The meaning of this to the SF consumer is clear. With 1979 loom- 
ing as SF’s most productive year to date with over 1000 new titles in 
the works, it’s becoming clear that the SF boom is here at last, as 
this month’s column amply demonstrates.

to make a m^or science fiction film together, but haven’t let anyone 
in on what it is. I suppose it's possible that it’s the Bradbury property. 
Spielberg is also working on the script of the sequel to CLOSE EN- 
COUNTERS, but is being cagey about the subject matter. Piecing 
together what clues I have, I wouldn’t be surprised if it had some- 
thing like the structure of GODFATHER II — some scenes in the past, 
in which Lacombe has his first close encounter, plus some scenes in 
the present following the further adventures of Roy Neary on his 
voyage with the extraterrestrials. Then again, I may be way off-base. 

I’m definitely not off-base in saying I know a good deal of the plot 
of the STAR WARS sequel, cumently being called THE EMPIRE 
STRIKES BACK! Since I came by accurate information legitimately, 
yet respect the wishes of Lucas et aJ not to let the plot out too soon, 
I’m torn. I will say; Princess Leia falls in love with one of our heroes: 
Luke gets a new teacher — of sorts; C3PO has an accident; there will 
be relatively few scenes in space; and if you like the stop-motion 
animation monsters of Ray Harryhausen, the first third will appeal to 
you very much. 

Speeiking of Ray Harryhausen, his next film was to be about Per- 
seus, from commissioned paintings by Cathy Hill, but his American 
financiers seem to want him to make another Sinbad film. After the 
last one, SINBAD AND THE EYE OF THE TIGER, which wasn’t 
much of a movie. I’m really sad to see Harryhausen squander his tal- 
ents oi> old stuff like that. 

John Milius (THE WIND AND THE LION) may be directing the 
CONAN film, to steu" Arnold Schwarzenegger. The script at this point 
is, as far as I’m concerned, unsatisfactory. Milius is also planning to 
include a few vague fantasy elements (mythical or prehistoric beasts 
glimpsed in the distance) in his proposed film on mountain man 
Jedediah Smith. Milius original script for JEREMIAH JOHNSON was 
quite different from what he has proposed for Jedediah Smith (who 
founded my home town)— which he describes as a Frank Frazetta 
Western, as opposed to the usual Frederic Remington Western.

lou can’t pussy-foot around 
dollars-and-cents facts, McBride!” 
T. J. Fawcett waddled in a half- 
circle in the center of the office. 
Ohio River Power’s administrative 
VP was throwing a snit, waving his 
arms and shouting, sagging face and 
jowls trembling. “The facts say that 
we can’t pay four times as much to 
clear filth because a handful of 
back-hollow dirt fanners make a 
fuss. Grow up! It’s cheaper to pay 
damages, allowing for the increased 
PR required, than to go back to 
clearing rights-of-way by hand. 
When are you going to learn not to 
let nobodies do your thinking?” 

Fawcett sat down, turning an unc- 
tuous half smile on old Davidson, 
ORP’s president and still nominal 
general manager. 

Wondering how such a colossal 
old shit ever got so far as a vice 
presidency. Cliff McBride gathered 
wits and patience for another try at 
making sense for Davidson. “Gary, 
there’s more at stake than just the 
money, or clearing these rights-of- 
way. The people know the stuff is 
dangerous, and that goes for more 
than the few farmers who have lost 
trees or even orchards. Another PR 
campaign isn’t going to bring back 
those crops, neither is paying dam- 
ages. Some farmers have been 
wiped out by Weedex. We could 
save that PR money and more, if 
we could cooperate with the farmers 
who have trees or watershed to their 
trees on these line and cable routes. ” 

“We’ve got trouble enough with 
environmentalists over this 2,4,5-T 
without adding more campaigners to 
their ranks. Let’s clear a few riskier 
routes by hand if that’s what it 
takes, and get people back on our 

58 



side for a change.” Cliff wiped a 
hand across his wide brow, gave 
old Davidson his appealing, 
perplexed look. But Fawcett was on 
his feet. 

“Dammit, boy, public relations 
isn’t your responsibility. Your re- 
sponsibility is to follow your in- 
structions and get those rights-of- 
way sprayed so we can get on with 
building a power plant.” The 
bloated administrator turned to the 
president with a pained expression 
on his face. “PR is administrative 
responsibility. Operations wants out 
of the inconvenience of dealing with 
a few snivelling hillbilly fanners 
and a crew of lazy pilots who’d 
rather bitch than fly!” 

To the president’s credit was the 
transparent, bony hand he raised, 
warding off Fawcett like a predator. 

“Siddown, T. J. McBride, can’t 
you get your boys back to work? 
This stopping work for every little 
complaint — ah-hemm. 

The . mmm . policy is al- 
ready established. This stuff you’re 
spraying hasn ’t been proved destruc- 
tive to their trees. It’s the spray all 
the other companies use, and we’ve 
got a right to treat our line and 
cable routes. Why make an expen- 
sive change the Board won’t be 
happy with? One we’ve paid 
thousands to avoid?” The hollow- 
cheeked old man looked up at Cliff 
for the first time since he came into 
the office an hour before. “Get ’em 
back in the air, son. Any way you 
can, himm? You can handle it.” 

“What do I tell the media, the 
farmers and the environmental ac- 
tion people who are going to storm 
my office the minute we get one 
chopper in the air?” Now Cliff was 



GALAXY 




on his feet, jaw jutting. 

“Nothing,” snapped Fawcett. 
“Just do your job without dragging 
Mr. Davidson into your petty 
problems — and stay the hell out of 
public relations!” 

★ 

The farther from Davidson’s 
office Cliff McBride got, the mad- 
der he got. How could he let that 
grotesque old buzzard call him boyl 
It was like the go-arounds with 
Katherine before the divorce; by the 
time his feelings caught up with his 
head, the opportunity ' was past, and 
he wound up with a dozen things to 
say and no one to say them to. By 
the time he got to Operations, he 
was fuming at himself. He pushed 
the door to the suite open forcefully 
and stormed through reception, ig- 
noring Sally’s greeting and smile. 

Beth Burkhammer, Cliff’s secre- 
tary, saw his face and rose with a 
quizzical look. “Fawcett? Or the 
farmers?” 

“Both,” he said with a sudden 
release of tension. He wished he 
knew how she got him to relax just 
by understanding things without ex- 
planation. He’d come to think of 
Beth as his girl Monday years ago 
when he was a plant super and she 
ran his office. Now he was glad she 
was in the operations office, with 
her understanding and efficiency. 
She had on coral wool, perfect for 
her tallish figure and April weather. 
Her brown-blonde hair fell forward 
over her knotted brow, pointing out 
her look of concern. 

“Idiots,” she said, following him 
to his door. “Fred Dutton is waiting 
with final printouts on Clay 



Ridge.” 

“Beth, can you get Bob Hen- 
dricks up here? One way or 
another, we’ve got to get that clear- 
ing done up on Yellow Creek. ” 

“Right. ” She turned to her desk. 

Fred Dutton was asleep in Cliff’s 
chair, feet on the desk. Cliff picked 
up the sheaf of printouts and sat in 
the other chair, scanning the data. 
Finding it was going to take more 
study, he dropped it on the desk 
with a thud. 

”Huh? Hi, Cliff. How’s it go- 
ing?” 

“Don’t ask. Fawcett pitched a fit 
about using hand labor up on Yel- 
low Creek, but he’s full of it.” 

The wiry little data processing 
whiz who was ORP’s chief accoun- 
tant since computerization stretched 
and got to his feet. “You go over 
the printouts. I’ll talk to you about 
budgeting. New estimates for the 
Board; they don’t like surprises. 
Hell, PR alone is over by something 
like 300%, since the high sulphur 
exemptions came through for Clay 
Ridge.” 

“PR,” spat Cliff. “What crap. 
Fawcett thinks it’s the answer to 
everything. Try to get a few bucks 
for hand-clearing so the farmers 
don’t lose what trees they’ve got 
left and he acts like it’s out of his 
own pocket. But not P-stinking-R! 
Spend the world trying to convince 
the public we’re doing them a favor 
filling the air with sulphur dioxide 
and the ground with 2,4, 5-T. It’s 
backwards, Freddie!” 

The buzzer sounded on his desk 
and Cliff pressed the tab. “Yes?” 
Fred circled the desk, making room 
for Cliff. 

It was Sally in reception. “Hen- 

59 



THE PSYCHIC 




dricks is here, sir.” 

“Send him in.” Cliff sat down, 
wondering if there was going to be 
a solution to anything. Fred 
stopped, the door open, and asked, 
“Tennis after?” 

“Sure.” The two had been regu- 
lars at the indoor courts all winter, 
since the demands of the new coal- 
fired plant at Clay Ridge made it 
obvious they weren’t going to get 
any skiing. 

Bob Henderson came in as Fred 
stepped out, and Cliff gave another 
sigh and wished he’d never heard of 
Weedex. 

★ 

The Spartan was not Sparta, 
Ohio’s most exclusive or expensive 
club, but it had an admirable dining 
room and was the only one with a 
bar and an indoor tennis court. Dut- 
ton and McBride made a fair match 
for beginners. Had the two been 
less enthusiastic they would never 
have attempted the second set. But 
no one was waiting, and they were 
having an intense, if frustrating, 
savage kind of fun. 

Fred had a rolling, pitch-faced 
serve that had good speed and in- 
credible topspin, so that Cliff had to 
scramble. Cliff compensated by 
leaning back and getting arm and 
shoulder into powerful forehand re- 
turns, keeping the base-line play 
hot. By the middle of the second 
set, they were streaming sweat into 
sodden whites and panting, growing 
a bit wild. 

It was on an exchange of charges 
to the net that Cliff fell. He lofted a 
ponderous backhand over Fred to 
pull him off the net, and charged to 



cut off the return. When Dutton saw 
that, he hit a little blooper short into 
the comer that just cleared the net. 
They figured it was a little pool of 
sweat that made Cliff slip, and fly 
headlong into the steel post that 
held the net. 

Fred leaped the net and turned 
Cliff over, frantically fingering the 
carotid for a pulse. It was fluttery, 
and he had to probe for it. 

★ 

Continuity crept back to Cliff 
McBride’s consciousness through 
the blinding, clear white sight-sound 
confusion of limitless awareness. 
Long before he came to himself, he 
came to perception. He perceived 
feeling below him, knowing above. 
Seeing, hearing, and understanding 
were all in between, and he per- 
ceived a flow between them all, 
colored streams of light with 
globules of contrasting color in 
diem, coursing like blood cells in 
an off-color fantastic journey. With 
perception of light and color came 
the lightshow. 

Vivid discs of colored light, fiery 
orange, then deeper red, oscillated 
and alternated with deepest green. 
Green deepened to gold that whirled 
and glowed with the light of a mil- 
lion suns, then faded to a silvery 
pinpoint surrounded by a blue 
sparking effervescence that ex- 
panded and intensified and shaded 
to rose-yellow, sweeping bars which 
spun in dazzling display. 

Then gleaming white faded to 
meaninglessness and pervaded 
Cliff’s consciousness totally, con- 
tracting to a central ball of white 
with twelve spinning gold bars sur- 



60 



GALAXY 




rounded by a thousand rays of dif- 
ferent colored, radiant light. The 
thousand-rayed sun spun, shooting 
contrasting sparks in all directions, 
an indescribable, achingly and cap- 
tivatingly beautiful mandala. 

Then he reached for or was at- 
tracted to the sun, and, somehow, 
he was soaring up towards it, 
through it, and then was where he 
could see connected starlets of light, 
seven tiny constellations gathered 
around him, each connected by 
glowing globules streaming from 
star to star. He floated above these 
star clusters, each different, yet 
each had a bottom star, fiery orange 
to muddy brown, each a top that 
was a giant rainbow chromatoscope 
with a white center whirling with 
yellow-gold spokes. 

Slowly, he settled toward a brighter, 
more vivid constellation that lay 
horizontal beneath the others. He 
entered the horizontal' starself at the 
sunbright six-rayed third star from 
the bottom and instantly rose-hued 
electric streams shot through him. 
Orange and red arcs with purple 
striations flowed downward, bring- 
ing awareness of lower limbs and 
organs. Oval globlets surged up- 
ward in a yellow stream to his heart 
and he felt it beating, pumping the 
vitality outward. 

Then one of the blue electric 
streams touched the redhued star at 
his solar plexus. Twin rays, one of 
clearest blue and the other lustrous 
violet, arched outward and upward 
from it, to a star at his throat, and 
rose in indigo irrevocability toward 
his head. 

White, undifferentiated sound 
welled up within him again, the 
all-in-all of randomness raised to in- 



finite power. Then slowly, so 
slowly, it faded into the babble of 
all the voices of all time, telling it 
all together in one ageless time of 
speaking. 

Smells and pungent tastes and a 
vague, abstract sensation of heavi- 
ness impinged, and coalesced into a 
red-black hammering, a pulsating 
pressure, sightsoundsense, that 
pounded in rhythmic inevitability in 
the astonished and bedazzled brain 
of Clifford Jackson McBride. 

He was himself, and he had all 
the headaches of his life crammed 
into one blinding, thud-whanuning 
killer pulsation of the cranium. 
With each heartbeat a pulse of bril- 
liant, pure lightsound perception 
burst within his stunned conscious- 
ness with the size and intensity of a 
star. He retched, gagged, and soon 
hands were turning, raising his body 
and he was aware of sickening mo- 
tion through the thunder in his 
skull. Cliff opened his eyes, 

Fred’s face, close and wide-eyed 
with shock, radiated violet-blue in 
all directions, and Cliff squeezed 
his eyes quickly shut again. A 
hundred-rayed burst of light shone 
where Fred’s head had been. The 
star divided horizontally, rose and 
yellow above the center, blue and 
purple below. As Cliff watched, 
stunned, the dividing interface 
curved slowly into an S-shape and 
began to rotate. Unbelieving, he 
opened his eyes, and there, above 
him, was Fred’s very worried face, 
still surrounded by its silver-blue 
aurora. 

Cliff blinked, but the illusion re- 
mained. Fear, sharp and compell- 
ing, made him close his eyes 
again, only to restore the whirling 



THE PSYCHIC 



61 




yellow-purple star. He opened them 
again, near panic, and the star dis- 
appeared, but the deep blue halo 
still surrounded Fred’s face. 

Stirring, Cliff tried to speak, but 
the sound was a dry croak in his 
throat. He moved a hand in front of 
his face, it o”bscured Fred’s head 
and was familiar. But it too was 
surrounded with bluish light. He 
studied the hand, and saw that the 
light began a half-inch from his 
skin. 

He stared at its now near-violet 
corruscations, wondering what 
could be wrong with his eyes. Then 
the throbbing returned, and a red 
shift overcame all other color in his 
sight and he sagged heavily, all 
perception focused involuntarily on 
the excruciating throb of his head. 

★ 

The nurse was glad to find Cliff 
awake in the dim hospital room, but 
impatient to be done with him. Her 
glow was reddish all over with sex- 
ual excitement. How can / know 
that? Her rounds were nearly done 
and she would meet him in the 
laundry room. But this is crazy. Not 
only is my vision messed up, but 
now I’m having thought- 
hallucinations. The overhearing was 
so effortless he hadn’t for a few 
moments realized it was her 
thoughts in his mind. 

Cliff looked carefully at her ruby 
sheen as she leaned over with the 
blood pressure cuff. She was 
thrumming with sexual anticipation. 
A nude, tanned young man substan- 
tially endowed appeared in his vis- 
ion and was gone. Now that’s 
ridiculous! / must be whacko from 

62 



banging my head. 

The thought brought the reality 
throbbing back to life and he tenta- 
tively felt the top of his head. There 
was a good-sized lump, but no 

bandage. It was painful to the 

touch, but the throbbing was now 
bearable. A dull ache filled his 

head. He looked at the nurse who 
was busy with his arm. 

“How . how long have I been 
here?’’ he asked. 

“One nineteen over seventy- 

four.” She made a note on some- 
thing and removed the cuff, taking 
his wrist and looking at her watch. 
“About four hours. I’m counting.” 
She finished and made another note, 
stood and turned to go. 

Unable to resist. Cliff said, 
“What’s his name?” 

“Lance. And he’s . oh, you 
go to hell.” Her flush matched her 
reddish aura. She left. 

So she did have a man on her 
mind. So what did that prove? Did 
it explain the red light beaming 
from every inch of her body? Did it 
explain how he saw the man as she 
must have seen him? Was this 
whole thing some kind of delusion 
caused by the blow? Cliff lay back 
against the pillow, turning these 
thoughts over and over in his mind. 

★ 

The doctor’s aura was green. He 
was glad to see Cliff conscious, 
though Cliff would have debated the 
issue if he hadn’t been fascinated 
and more than a little alarmed by 
the emerald glow around the man’s 
youthful, unkempt body. He was 
thinking about concussion, cerebral 
hemorrhage, and deep muscle

suturing techniques, the latter for 
this morning’s lecture. There it is 
again! Am I dreaming this, or 
what? 

“Doctor . why am I seeing 
colors?” 

“Colors?” There was interest in 
the unshaven face. 

“Well, I . .I’m seeing colors 
around everybody. You are green, 
or at least there’s green shimmering 
around your body. The nurse’s body 
was surrounded by red. Could con- 
cussion do that?” 

“Could, I suppose, though. 
Describe the lights.” 

“They’re . well, they start 
just a little way from your skin and 
radiate outward about this far, then 
thin out at the edges. The color’s 
very vivid and it seems . elec- 
tric. ” 

“Hmmm.” The doctor tipped 
Cliff’s head up for a close look. His 
pencil flash shone into first one eye, 
then the other. “We have seen 
some visual phenomena associated 
with hemeralopia, or day blind- 
ness,” he said. “And, I suppose it 
could be a temporary effect of the 
injury. I wouldn’t worry about it. 
You have a mild concussion, but I 
don’t see any real danger signals. If 
there are no changes, you can go on 
home in the morning.” 

He stood, thinking about finish- 
ing his rounds and his suturing 
notes for the morning class. “I 
would,” he said, “definitely avoid 
tennis or any other strenuous activ- 
ity for a few days. Can you sleep 
without medication? It’s really bet- 
ter with recent concussion, espe- 
cially with unusual symptoms.” 

“I think so.” The scruffy young 
doctor withdrew. 



★ 

Fred was fringed with purple and 
green when he came into the room. 
Worry and good will emanated from 
him so tangibly Cliff could feel 
their warmth physically, as though 
absorbing them through his skin. 
Beth came behind, wearing a print 
dress obviously chosen for its cheer- 
iness. Cliff wondered why he saw 
no aura around Beth. Fred’s con- 
cerned, guilt-laden thoughts were 
clear to him, but he had no idea 
what Beth was thinking. She stood 
there trying to smile. Fred broke the 
awkward silence. 

“So how you feeling?” He 
grinned, masking his fear and guilt 
with effusiveness. He sat on the end 
of the bed, but Beth hovered, stand- 
ing. 

“I’m okay. Doctor said not to 
worry. I’ve got a funny thing with 
my eyes, but he said it would go 
away. Concussion. Doesn’t much 
hurt now. How did it happen?” 
“Cracked your noggin on the net 
post. Scared the shit out of me. 
Your eyes looked funny, rolled up. 
Sure you’re okay?” 

“Yeah, except for. ...” 

“Well / think you’re both fools!” 
Beth was red in the face, a bright 
contrast to her green eyes. “Playing 
so hard you knock yourselves out at 
a game that’s too strenuous for men 
your age. Think about your heart, 
let alone getting hurt. You should 
have more sense.” 

Cliff tried to probe her thoughts. 
Nothing. Why should she be so 
worried? Sure, they had been 
friends through their long associa- 
tion at the power company, but this 
was the first time she had ever

acted like this. He wished he could 
tell what was going on in her mind. 

Quickly, Cliff changed the sub- 
ject. “Henderson have any trouble 
getting the choppers back in the 
air?” He pulled himself up on one 
elbow, then sat erect to show he 
wasn’t really hurt. A lie. 

“For about twenty minutes,” 
Fred said. “According to Bob, they 
came back to the field saying if he 
was so goddamned hot to get that 
spraying done, he could do it him- 
self. They weren’t going to get shot 
at for anybody.” 

“Shot at?” 

“Farmers,” said Beth quietly. 
“Deer rifles and shotguns. Bob 
didn’t know what to do. The pilots 
were scared silly. ” 

“Anybody hurt? What about the 
equipment?” 

“No, no injuries and no damage. 
Just bluffing, I suppose.” 

Cliff turned back the cover, put 
his feet on the floor and remem- 
bered he hadn’t a great deal on. 
“Let’s get down there,” he said. 
“Fred, get somebody to check me 
out and bring me my clothes. Beth, 
call Bob and tell him to meet us at 
the maintenance yard. Tell him to 
bring all the laborers he can round 
up without delay, and — ” 

“Whoa!” Fred pushed him 
gently but firmly back onto the bed. 
“You aren’t going anywhere until 
the doctors say it’s okay. I’ll check 
with them, and Beth can make the 
call. But someone else can meet 
Henderson. Relax.” 

★ 

They worked out the details when 
the two came back to his room.

GALAXY 





Henderson could send crews in to 
cut the YeUow Creek right-of-way 
by hand, and Fred could route the 
expenses through emergency 
maintenance. Land subsidence, they 
decided, with enough exposed cable 
to require extensive hand labor. 
They could get the pilots back to 
spraying, but in another area. Being 
able to overhear much of Fred’s 
thought made the planning go 
quickly, often leaving Beth lost in 
the leap from notion to second or 
third level ramification. At last they 
agreed, and the pair went off to 
enact the plan themselves, insisting 
that he should rest. 

★ 

Rest was slow in coming. Cliff 
struggled with the implications of 
his hallucinations and his eaves- 
dropping on minds. When he closed 
his eyes, a waterfall, wide and 
frothy, poured over the blackness of 
his vision. He blinked it away, 
wondering what the hell, and it was 
replaced by a truck, a monster 
semi, roaring past the brickyards. 
The sight of the truck filled him 
with terror and hatred, and he 
opened his eyes, trying to will the 
image to disappear. It persisted 
even with his eyes open, drawing 
closer and closer, lumbering down 
upon him. When it finally roared 
past, he collapsed back into the bed 
with a sigh. 

New images filled his mind. A 
fluffy dog, crying; two women 
whispering dark secrets he could not 
understand; knives and chairs and 
filing cabinets and data display 
screens and doors behind doors be- 
hind doors, each seeming to contain 



wisdom but opening on another 
door. He sat up again, batting at the 
images with his hands. He was 
about to ring for the nurse and ask 
for something to help him sleep 
when he heard the scream. 

High-pitched and achingly in- 
tense, it was the scream of a wom- 
an’s sheer terror. Could all this be 
some kind of delusion — starbodies 
and color tricks and mindreading 
and visions like flights of birds 
around my head, and the scream- 
ing? Rattled. I'm addled by the 

concussion, and the 

hemeralowhatever. 

With introspective came respite. 
The scream was gone and the 

images with it. Exhausted, he was 
asleep almost immediately. 

★ 

The second scream awoke Cliff 
McBride before dawn, spine- 

chilling in its urgency, and so long 
that he was sitting upright, hands 
clapped to ears before it subsided. A 
dream, he thought. It has to be. Noth- 
ing so bizarre could be real. 

Bits of sentences came in his 
mind then. Secrets half-whispered 
in a dozen voices, some with faces 
in varying focus, some without. The 
starbody vision faded in and out of 
sight, giving the broken urgencies of 
thought a transitory, dreamlike qual- 
ity. Cliff thrashed in the bed, play- 
ing over and again the fears and an- 
guish, the shattered hopes, the hor- 
rors and humiliations of a hundred 
desperate lives. 

At light he awoke to another 
scream, head pounding, pulse rac- 
ing, bed soaked with sweat. It felt 
to Cliff as if his mind had tom with 



THE PSYCHIC 



65 




the screaming, and through the gap 
came visions to shame his dreams. 
Silent, raging faces, scenes of 
which he had no memory, voices 
crying, mumbling, shouting and 
speaking all at once. 

With the desperate fury of his 
rage against the fate that had cast 
him in this role, a fury not equalled 
since the death-throes of his mar- 
riage to Katherine, Operations Man- 
ager Clifford Jackson McBride held 
his head in his hands and wept — he 
had not since childhood. 

★ 

Beth drove him to the office 
around ten. She’d wanted to take 
him to his apartment, but there was 
far too much nothing there for 
safety. He wanted activity, people, 
usefulness to fill his confusing time. 
The halo phenomenon continued, on 
nearly everyone but Beth. She was 
opaque and solid, a steady image in 
a world gone unstable. She coddled 
him, anticipated his needs, and kept 
the routines moving in the office 
and the department. The tale of the 
bump on the head had to be re- 
peated for others who stopped by 
for a chat. He studied the modifica- 
tions analysis and procedural 
schedules for Clay Ridge. He still 
had the impression of sensing what 
was going on in others’ minds, but 
he avoided thinking about it, throw- 
ing himself into work as an escape. 
To an extent, it worked. 

Henderson came in at four-thirty 
with a progress report on Yellow 
Creek. It was half-finished and they 
could be out by Saturday. But word 
had leaked to Fawcett, and the VP 
wanted to see Cliff right away. 



Fawcett, damn his eyes! A 
foreboding tingle came to Cliff’s 
mind, but he thrust it off with his 
hatred. 

★ 

The office above Cliff’s was 
nearly as opulent as that of the pres- 
ident. Fawcett’s desk was neat as a 
pin and behind it he sat, scowling 
as Cliff came in and took a chair. 

Cliff could see the reddish 
brown, murky aura, and behind the 
baggy, limpid eyes, a glittering, 
spinning vortex of images. He 
stared, slackjawed in disbelief, at 
the flickering thought images of the 
vice president. 

“You had to do it, didn’t you?” 
The pendulous dewlaps shook with 
anger. “Get yourself a nice quiet 
little hand crew up on Yellow 
Creek, against Davidson’s 
orders — not to mention my own. 
Who the hell do you think you 
are? ... No answer? I thought not. 
It won’t wash, McBride. Insubordi- 
nation, even at management level, 
is a dismissal, and I intend to see 
that Mr. Davidson and the board get 
a full report of . this preposter- 
ous effrontery. What are you 
staring at?” 

Cliff managed a smile. “Your 
thoughts, T. J. Your petty, super- 
cilious, self-aggrandizing, avari- 
cious and cynical old man’s thoughts. 
They’re disgusting.” 

“You must be out of your mind. 
Thoughts! I’d think you would take 
this seriously, boy. Now you listen 
to me — ” But Cliff was on his feet, 
fists clenched, jaw set. 

“I don’t give a lineman’s fart! 
You stick public relations and pur- 



66 



GALAXY 




chasing and your petty power plays 
right up your administrative ass, 
and let me get the work done. What 
the hell is it to you, anyway?” 
Fawcett’s mental images came 
suddenly clear. Cliff saw a small 
man in a sharkskin suit handing 
rolls of cash to Fawcett. He saw 
purchase vouchers and invoices and 
delivery receipts all arranged in 
careful order, and every one of 
them fraudulent. Bills for goods and 
services never delivered. Checks to 
a dozen different companies, each 
cashed at a different local bank by 
the same man with a mole beside 
his nose. And he saw the scheme. 

Simons was the man’s name and 
he had carefully compiled a dossier 
on Fawcett and others. Cliff saw 
bedroom scenes in polaroid squal- 
lor, each featuring Fawcett and a 
different woman. The postures of 
the Polaroid couples were pretty 
kinky. Simons’ investigation had 
started out as a divorce case, and 
had wound up more profitable than 
expected. He was pumping Fawcett, 
and who knew how many others. 

“Everything in this company is 
my business, McBride. And imper- 
tinence is going to cost you. You 
don’t know the first thing about 
administrative work, and it’s begin- 
ning to look like you can’t handle 
operations either. Now get out of 
here and get that crew recalled — ” 
“How much is he into you for, 
T.J.? And how much of it have you 
chalked up to Reddy Kilowatt?” 

‘ ‘What? What are you talking 
about? Get out of here and get those 
crews back where they belong.” 
“Right. Sure. Go fuck yourself. 
On camera.” 

“GET OUT!” Cliff got. 



★ 

“Thanks for coming over, Fred; I 
know it’s late. Chair. Coffee? Beth, 
if you will, and you take a chair 
too, huh?” Fred was puzzled, his 
bluish aura subdued. He had come 
right up when Cliff had called a lit- 
tle after five. 

When coffee had been served. 
Cliff wiped a hand across his brow. 

“Two things. One makes no 
sense at all, the other only too 
much.” 

Fred shifted, glowing to Cliff’s 
eyes with now clear blue light. His 
mind was calm, clear, intent. 

Beth, still the exception to his 
new-found abilities, sat primly, 
hands clasped in her lap. 

“It’s . it’s crazy. I ... I 
can . well, at least it seems to 
me that I can read some people’s 
thoughts, feel their feelings.” 

“You mean like telepathy?” Beth 
asked calmly. 

“Read minds?" Fred was agog. 
“You mean like those experiments 
at Duke?” 

“Well . sort of. Ever since 
that thump on the head yesterday, 
I ’ve been seeing and hearing the 
strangest things. You, Fred, you 
have a blue halo around your body 
that completely mystifies me.” 

“Aura?” Beth again. “As in as- 
tral body? As in Madame 
Blavatsky? Cliff, that’s marvellous. 
I’ve been fascinated by psychic 
phenomena for years! What does it 
look like?” 

“It doesn’t seem to work with 
everyone. Just sometimes, and al- 
most always with some people, like 
Fred.” 

“Look,” Fred suggested. “If this 

67 



THE PSYCHIC 




is true, we can test it. What am I 
thinking right now?” 

Cliff stared at him, searching for 
the flickering display of thought- 
images, but couldn’t see it. The 
blue glow was sustained, but 
nowhere in it could he find Fred’s 
thoughts. 

“I can’t. Maybe it has to do with 
pressure, or feeling or something. 
But when it happens, I know it. 
The nurse in the hospital was ... I 
could read her perfectly. And the 
doctor, I could hear him making 
mental notes on a lecture he was 
going to give. Don’t think I’m imag- 
ining all this. I have trouble with 
that myself as it is. I about decided 
I was losing my mind, or had brain 
damage from the concussion.” 

“TTie human aura,” Beth put in, 
“is a testable, demonstrable biolec- 
tric phenomenon. Kerlian took pic- 
tures of it, and everybody from 
Kilner and his glass screens, to 
Wilhelm Reich with his orgone, 
claim it's for real. It isn’t imagina- 
tion. Annie Besant said it was like 
drawing a picture or singing. Ev- 
erybody can do it, but it t^es talent 
to do it well no matter how hard 
you work at it.” 

“Any of these people report any- 
thing about mindreading?” 

“Sure, and didn’t Peter Hurkos 
get his talent by falling off a house 
on his head?” Neither man knew. 
But it was clear that Beth, at least, 
accepted what he said, believed it 
true. His relief was tangible. Fred 
said nothing. 

“Well. There it is, whatever it is. 
I don’t pretend to understand; god, 
it scares the piss out of me. But it 
gave me something that may shake 
up Ohio River Power where it’ll do 

68 



the most good. ” 

“Fawcett is embezzling. I don’t 
have details — that’s what I need you 
for, Fred. Is it possible there could 
be phony invoices, false delivery 
slips and so on? Would our com- 
puter catch something like that?” 
“Possible? Hell, some corpora- 
tions take a certain amount of it for 
granted. Sure, it can be done. Pur- 
chasing kickbacks, the whole rebate 
scheme, some of it legal, some 
not — that stuff is all around us. 
Good paperwork is hard to spot, 
especially if it has the right hash- 
marks, entry stamps and ^1. But it 
is possible.” He sat back and slap- 
ped his knee. “Fawcett! I’ll 
damned. How do you know? Some- 
body squeal, not getting a big 
enough slice of the pie?” 

“Well, no. I ... I picked it out 
of T. J.’s corroded, disgusting old 
mind. Somebody named Simons is 
threatening to expose his sex life to 
his wife and maybe even the com- 
pany. Damned if 1 know what dif- 
ference it would make. He’s the one 
who’s scared. The details weren’t 
clear, but dammit, I saw it in his 
mind! I’m sure Simons is doing it, I 
just don’t know how. Could you tell 
anything by the accounts?” 

“Sure. Let’s go down and see.” 
Fred rose, and Beth stood also. 

“I hope you catch that sleazy old 
man. He’s got a reputation as a 
lecher that spans three departments 
and five elevators. If you need me. 
I’ll be at home, reading up on 
psychic phenomena. Good night. 
And Cliff, get some rest. You don’t 
look very good.” 

“Night,” said Cliff, “And, 
Beth — thanks, huh?” 

She turned in the middle of the 

GALAXY 




room, looking suddenly vulnerable. 
“You’re welcome. I never really 
knew a psychic before. Maybe one 
of these days you’ll read my mind.’’ 
Flushing, she fled. 

“Well, come on,” said Fred Dut- 
ton, eager. “Time’s wasting, and 
neither one of us has had any sup- 
per.” 

★ 

It was there, most of it in PR’s 
expenditures. Though not obvious, 
it could be detected in comparisons 
with the previous fiscal year expen- 
ditures for the same goods and ser- 
vices. PR was up 287% over last 
year. Alone in the data processing 
center in the accounting department, 
the two studied the display screen, 
comparing and contrasting. Dutton’s 
audit Showed a heavy weighting of 
expenses for PR materials, services 
and supplies in favor of one 
company — Simons-Bertram Com- 

munications. Over thirty-six 
thousand dollars in seven months. 

Cliff gave a low whistle. Fred 
said, “And who can tell how much 
more, in other expense categories, 
veiled by complex administrative 
expense accounting? He pushed 
away from the console, and tapped 
the display screen. It showed the 
vendor record file, and under his 
finger was the entry:

Fred punched “replace file” on 
the keyboard, and then 
“execute” — the screen went blank. 

“Okay. I believe you. I don’t 
care if you read it in the entrails of 
a shmoo. Tomorrow we dig in, get 
paperwork together and hang our- 
selves a senior executive. But to- 
night we are going to eat steak — on 
me — and then you are going to rest. 
You are going to ne^ your 
strength, and you do not look 
exactly terrific.” 

Fred was standing with his hand 
on the light switch when a fat little 
man in lime slacks and yellow shirt 
pushed a cart through the door. 

“I’ll get that, Mr. Dutton. I 
thought you’d be through in here.” 

“Oh, Johnson. What keeps you 
so late?” 

‘ ‘Sub-routine procedure updates 
for key-punch. Don’t worry. I’ll 
shut off the lights and lock up.” 

“Okay. Good night.” The two 
men watched the little clerk waddle 
behind his cart to the input stations. 
He wore white shoes, and his aura 
was subdued lavender. 

Fred and Cliff went out to dinner. 
It was over an hour before the lights 
went out in data processing. 

★ 

The screams woke Cliff in the 
predawn hours again. Grumbling, 
he trudged to the bathroom and took 
a pill. 

In bed he tried, in those minutes 

69 



THE PSYCHIC 




before the pill took effect, to sort 
out the mechanics of mental eaves- 
dropping. It was obvious that prox- 
imity made a difference. Why? 
Was it actual brain wave radiation 
he was pickipg up? And another 
thing: why were there no trivialities, 
no grocery-list-and-gas-the-car type 
thoughts. Inconsequential thoughts 
didn’t get through. Why? The one 
constant factor was that every in- 
coming thought had emotional sig- 
nificance. Why? What gave these 
thoughts the power — power? 

Maybe it worked like radio. Why 
not? Emotion would be the carrier 
wave that provided the power of the 
broadcast; and the thoughts, the pic- 
tures and voices, were the modula- 
tion that gave the signal pattern. 
You would have field strength, 
modulation percentage, and fre- 
quency. the emotions of human 
beings different frequencies? Do 
they radiate? If so, you’d have 
standing and delta wave tuning, or 
something analogous, as well as 
ground effect (or would it be line- 
of-sight?), diffusion, refraction, 
band- width, and whether it would 
be frequency or amplitude mod- 
ulated. And what about ambient 
RF — or should it be EF, for em- 
pathic frequency as opposed to 
radio frequency — you would have to 
filter that out somehow, for just as 
there are lots of random sources of 
radio waves creating static all the 
time, so there are lots and lots of 
people (and why not other animals?) 
creating random empathic signals. 
And no federal agency regulating 
frequencies and transmitter loca- 
tions, public service value or signal 
strength. Strength. 

It all comes back to power. As- 

70 



suming that the brain or something 
could function as a natural or acci- 
dental empathic heterodyne, receiv- 
ing telepathic transmissions the way 
a filling will with radio, you still 
haven’t established that the emo- 
tions create a radiant signal. He 
thought about the star bodies and 
wondered for the hundredth time 
just what those person-sized constel- 
lations really were. And wouldn’t 
all those people transmitting all the 
time create a lot of interference? 

That’s why it stops when / get 
upset. He thought. Tm creating an 
interfering signal inside myself. He 
didn’t know and admitted it. 
Couldn’t know, and couldn’t prove 
it if he did — but he could test it as a 
hypothesis. If it turned out to be 
true, could you learn to tune in vi- 
brations you wanted, and tune out 
the undesirable ones? He hoped so. 
As the sleeping pill began to drag at 
him, he recalled the old tube-type 
Philco receiver when he was a lad. 
It would squeal and howl at times, 
but the reception and reproduction 
quality was excellent. 

And what did you do when it 
didn’t work? Whomp it a good one! 
The thought made his head hurt. 

★ 

The telephone woke Cliff with a 
start. 

“Yes?” 

“Mr. McBride?” It was Sally in 
reception. His watch said 9:40. 

“Yes?” 

“Is Mr. Dutton there with you?” 
There was fear in her voice. 

“No ... no Fred’s not here. 
What’s up?” 

“Well, sir. Maybe nothing, but 
GALAXY 




when Brenda came with the mail, 
she asked if I’d found Mr. Dutton 
yet because sometimes he comes to 
your office, and she knew Cindy ’d 
told me because she had donuts 
with her on break and she said she 
didn’t know — ” 

“Sally.” Cliff sat up, yawning. 

“ — whether I’d heard anything 
yet or if — ” 

"Miss Horgdorn, please!" 

“Sir?” 

“Start at the beginning. Is Mr. 
Dutton not in his office?” Cliff 
managed to stand, dragging the 
phone after him toward the bath- 
room. 

“Oh, no sir. We looked.” 

“I should have known.” 

“Sir?” 

“Sally, just tell me what this is 
about.” 

“Mr. Dutton didn’t come in this 
morning. Nobody thought anything 
about it, because sometimes — ” 

“I know. Go on.” He reached 
the bathroom and started in with the 
Norelco. 

“Well, Mr. Dutton’s secretary 
asked Mr. Finch’s receptionist to 
call me and ask if he had been here 
this morning, but the mail girl was 
coming over here anyway and she 
said she’d ask me. Well — ” 

“Miss Horgdom. Sally. Is Beth 
— here?” 

“Oh, no sir. That’s why I called. 
I wouldn’t dream of disturbing you 
at home, except Beth came out of 
the office while Brenda was here 
and said she’d give Mr. Dutton’s 
residence a call and see if he was 
there and if he knew whether you 
were coming in, since she didn’t 
want to disturb you if you didn’t 
feel well. She went back in her 



office and I saw the button light up 
on the phone and then she just came 
running out of the office and went 
right out the door and down the 
hall! She hasn’t come back and I 
didn’t know what to do, so I called 
you. ” 

“Of course,” he said drily, 
working the shaver into the 
almost^mpled point of his chin. 
“Did she say anything when she 
left?” 

“No sir. She just went running 
right past me and out — Oh, yes! ’ ’ 

“What did she say?” 

“No calls.” 

“I should have known.” 

“Sir?” 

“Never mind. Just try Mr. Dut- 
ton’s home every few minutes. I’ll 
stop by on my way to the office.” 

“Yes sir. I’m sorry to disturb 
you at home like this, Mr. 
McBride. ” 

Cliff banged the receiver down 
with a start and nearly toppled onto 
the sink. The scream that erupted 
inside his head was louder than 
ever. He stared at nothing, beads of 
sweat forming on face and arms. 
Why didn’t Fred answer his phone 
if he wasn’t in the office? He 
wanted to get those bogus invoices 
first thing this morning. He was 
ashamed to have overslept, himself. 
And where had Beth gone in such a 
hurry? He punched Fred’s number 
into the phone. 

“I’m sorry, but the number you 
have reached is not in service. 
Please be sure you — ” Again Cliff 
banged the phone on its rest, then 
lifted it and dialed zero. He was 
nearly through dressing — brown tie, 
light brown hounds-tooth — by the 
time the operator gave up. There 



THE PSYCHIC 



71 




was something wrong with the 
number. No tone, no ring, nothing. 
Open line. “I’m sorry, sir, but that 
number seems to be out of order. 
Shall I connect you with — It was 
McBride’s day for slamming down 
phones. He tied his shoes and hus- 
tled out to his car. 

As the motor hummed to life, the 
scream overwhelmed him again. He 
lay his head forward on the wheel. 
As the scream subsided, an image 
came like a three-dimensional pro- 
jection. A kitchen, with a wrought- 
iron dinette in the foreground. 
Fred’s kitchen! What the-? A 
sharp blow struck him on the left 
cheek. He raised his head and 
looked around in confusion. The 
scream followed instantly and 
seemed in his throat as well as his 
mind, and he realized that he was 
experiencing someone else’s subjec- 
tivity. 

He gave a jerk backward against 
the headrest and his head throbbed. 
The illusion was gone and he was 
back in the Buick, sweat burning 
his eyes and soaking his sportcoat. 
He wijjed his face on his sleeve, 
found the shift lever and flung the 
Buick into the traffic of Forty-ninth 
Street. 

It was nearly two miles across 
town to Fred’s house on Birch 
Court, and as Cliff threaded his way 
through the station wagons and de- 
livery trucks, the fear crept back 
into his mind. The slap was so viv- 
idly real he was sure his face was 
red where it struck. An image of 
Fred’s bedroom came into his mind, 
blending with his actual vision so 
that it appeared to float above the 
road ahead. 

Cliff tensed, afraid he would 



smash the car, with the bed and the 
dresser and the big man with the 
mustache hovering superimposed on 
a miniwagon. With his rising fear, 
the bedroom faded, and his ap- 
prehension continued to grow till he 
rounded the comer into Birch Court 
and dodged a dark green Chrysler to 
screech to a halt behind Fred’s Dat- 
sun. 

Heart pounding and head throb- 
bing, Cliff dashed to the door, 
yelling “Fred!’’ and trying the 
doorknob. It was locked. He 
sprinted around the back. It was 
locked, too, but he charged with his 
slotback’s shoulder and it sprung 
open. 

There was the wrought-iron di- 
nette and the rest of the kitchen, but 
no Fred. He called his name and 
quickstepped to the living room and 
up the hall to the front bedroom. He 
burst in and there was Fred in the 
bed, peaceful and oblivious. But 
then, if he’s here asleep, why didn’t 
he answer the phone? And where is 
Beth? Catching his breath, he tried 
to think. He suddenly felt foolish. 
But, dammit — what about the 
phone, and what about Beth? 

He lifted the phone from the 
nightstand. Dead. It wasn’t until he 
put the receiver down again that he 
saw the note. In a scrawly, uneven 
parody of the accountant’s precise 
hand, it read; 

' 7 thought no one would find 
out. I’ve been a fool. Tell Clifford I 
couldn’t stand for him to know.” 

Cliff .stuffed the note in his 
pocket and looked at the silent form 
on the bed. No aura! Looking 
closer he saw the long, slow swell 
of chest and prayed it wasn’t too 
late. He snatched back the covers

and turned the terribly limp body 
over, lifting an eyelid to show only 
white. He checked the left wrist for 
pulse, found none, tried the carotid. 
Faint. Slow. He debated what to 
do. As he tried to force his mind to 
analyze, to reach a decision, he 
spotted the empty prescription bottle 
in the wastebasket. 

Deciding, he ran out the door and 
through the front, fumbling with the 
latch, out and across two driveways 
and pounded on the front door of 
the next house. 

The grayhaired lady with the pur- 
ple luminescence let him in to use 
the phone. The fire dispatcher asked 
him if he knew what kind of pills 
and how many. He said seconal, 
but he didn’t Imow how many. The 
dispatcher told him to get his friend 
up and moving and try to make him 
vomit. They would send an ambu- 
lance. 

Back in the room he got the life- 
less Fred out of the bed and tried 
dragging him around the floor, try- 
ing to make him walk. It was no 
use. Cold- sweat made Cliff’s hands 
slippery and he lugged the limp 
body into the bathroom. Running 
the water into the tub, he splashed 
some on the pale face. Too pale, 
too still. What if it’s too late, and 
he’s dying right here in my arms? 
Oh god, no, please no. 

Aching with grief and fear, tears 
streaming down his broad cheeks, 
small sounds escaping his throat, he 
held his friend on his knees and 
hung his head over the tub. Afraid 
he would choke him in his uncon- 
scious state and equally afraid he 
would never, never puke. Cliff 
wriggled his index finger down the 
unresponsive throat again and again. 



He was still trying when the ambu- 
lance arrived. 

The squad of three were profes- 
sional, efficient. One took the slack 
form from Cliff’s arms, another 
helped lay him down on a stretcher 
and the third drew Cliff aside and 
sat him down on the bed, waving a 
pungent ampoule at him. 

“Lie down and put your feet up. 
Any idea what he took or how 
many?’’ Cliff reached the empty 
bottle from the wastebasket. The 
hand that accepted it had a greenish 
dark glow. “Any idea how long 
ago?’’ He shook his head and 
wished he hadn’t. 

Cliff looked at the stretcher and 
the other two attendants had Fred’s 
floppy head tipped back, inserting a 
tube in his mouth. He looked away. 
The paramedics all had auras, but 
not Fred Dutton. 

“Leave a note?” Cliff considered 
the question. There was something 
about the note ... it didn’t look 
right, and Fred had never called 
him Clifford. Always Cliff, or 
McBride. “No,” he said, “no 
note.” Was the use of his full first 
name a clue? If those words were 
meant to indicate that Fred had been 
involved in something, like Faw- 
cett’s ripoff, then they were 
bullshit. “No, none.” 

The attendant was saying some- 
thing about relaxing a minute when 
the scream dashed over Cliff’s con- 
sciousness, rocking him where he 
sat, blurring his vision and making 
his head pound. He shut his eyes 
and a scene of traffic and the green 
interior of a car came into his vis- 
ion. It was as though he, terrified, 
were driving the car. He could see 
the green hood, the traffic, yes, it

was route 7 from the look of the 
buildings. The hands turned the 
wheel and he knew them. Beth! 

He watched in shock as her/his 
vision left the road and glanced at 
the pistol in the knuckly fist on the 
lap of the large man with the mus- 
tache. He strained to hear as vision 
returned to the road. They were 
passing the mall, thick traffic slow- 
ing their progress. Fear rose in him, 
black and chilling. 

“Buddy? Hey, buddy! You 
okay?” The ampoule smell came 
again. He gasped and opened his 
eyes on the attendant, who bore him 
down on the bed and pulled a blan- 
ket over him. “Look, you don’t 
look too great. Better rest awhile, 
and come on down to the hospital 
when you feel steady, okay?” 

“Um . which hospital?” 

“Sparta United. Just come to 
Emergency and they’ll direct you. 
Better let your head clear first, 
though. We gotta take your friend, 
but 1 think he’ll be all right.” 

In seconds the three were gone, 
and Cliff threw back the cover and 
waited till he saw them drive off 
before running unsteadily to the 
Buick. 

He urged the Buick down River- 
view, parallel to route 7. They were 
headed north past the mall, so he 
could stay on Riverview and make 
up some time. But how far were 
they going? He didn’t know, then 
suddenly he did. He’d seen it. The 
brickyards! Tension gripped him 
again, as the memory of a truck 
roared through his mind. He 
mashed the accelerator and fought 
for a clear memory of the cross- 
streets north of the mall — the nearer 
the brickyards the better. In less 



than five minutes he was over the 
Coal Creek bridge and around a 
comer onto Seventy-second Street. 
But traffic clogged up and he had to 
duck a block farther north, and 
made the access road that ran be- 
hind the tracks and the brickyards in 
under two minutes. 

Suddenly there, he didn’t know 
what to do. He crept toward the in- 
tersection of 7 and could see no 
green Chrysler, or any other car 
closer than the crowded parking lot 
way up the road ncathward, and noth- 
ing stirred there. He backed into a 
gated rear entryway and was pulling 
out when he saw the car. It was be- 
tween two freightcars and the tall 
man was yanking Beth from the 
drivers’ door. They were maybe six 
hundred feet away. As he watched, 
the mustached man propelled her 
forcibly by one arm across the short 
open space and into the narrow 
alley between two buildings. 

Cliff ran, not daring to think, to 
the mouth of the dleyway and 
looked around the comer. He could 
see nothing but the occasional zip 
of a vehicle past the narrow end of 
the alley. He had started up the al- 
leyway when the scream knocked 
him to his knees with its clenching, 
blinding ferocity. 

Behind closed eyes he saw the 
mustached man for a second, then 
felt his arms pinned behind him, 
clamped in an iron grip. 

Wrong mind! Wrong mind, 
stupid! Pull back. Breathe deep and 
calm down and pull out of her 
mind! With an effort and a few 
deep breaths it began to work. He 
could feel the sensation of her- 
ness blur and then slip from him. 
Then he was above and behind the

two and could feel the dark brood- 
ing mind of the man. 

He reached toward the man with 
his will, seeing his darkling halo 
and tuning on its umber glow. As 
he sought for the right level, the 
right frequency, the glow reddened 
and brightened with anticipation, 
then subsided. A car whipped by 
southbound. 

Straining, forcing calm on his tor- 
tured nerves, the psychic reached 
into the hooded horribleness of that 
twisted mind. No glimmering here, 
no star of vitality. Just a green- 
brown knot of seething lust for 
death. Lust for the blood that would 
splatter off the grille of the truck 
and the broken ragdoll flight of the 
mangled body that would be dead 
before it landed. 

The hungering, slavering evil 
aroused disgust and revulsion so 
elemental in Cliff that he nearly lost 
the contact with the killer’s mind. 
“!!!” went the mind in a quicken- 
ing of anticipation. A truck’s low 
rumble began in the distance. 

No screamed Cliff’s mind as the 
sound grew. A hatred rose and 
threatened his tuning on the sick 
man’s mind. In desperation, he 
pushed the hatred and the fear and 
the revulsion away from himself, 
pushed it toward the truck, piled it 
on the red and white tractor and 
away from the mind he needed. He 
thrust and shoved his swelling, 
loathing rage at the truck with dl 
his emotional might, holding the 
sniggering deathlust in focus. When 
the eyes of the man fed him the 
sight of the truck, small but rapidly 
growing in the distance. Cliff seized 
the vision. Frantically he called to 
his own emotive power, now vested 



in the barreling, rocking die.sd. pull- 
ing it toward him, elongating and 
stretching the image of the truck, 
nearer and nearer. 

With an emphatic ejaculation of 
pent-up ten.sion, the man jerked the 
woman upright and, timing care- 
fully, propelled her into the path of 
the truck. 

Cliff recognized her paralyzing 
scream of terror and his soul ached 

Incredibly, the image of the truck 
in the man’s mind passed through 
her, and she took a stumbling step 
and began to run with all her might. 

In a reflex as ancient as lizards 
and insects, as cats and mice, the 
burly, mustached man scrambled 
after her. The truck driver later 
swore in testimony he had seen the 
lady run across the road, but not the 
man whose heavy body stove in his 
Kenworth emblem and flew eighty- 
three feet. 

★ 

They sat on Fred’s hospital bed 
and told it all, Beth leaning back 
into Cliff’s embrace and turning for 
the occasional kiss. Fred’s aura was 
bright as ever and his lean brow 
knit in the recounting of Beth’s in- 
terruption of his inquisition. 

Beth, hugging Cliff’s arms round 
her body, told of the drive to the 
brickyards and the hysterical fear, 
and the amazing escape, but could 
not retell the horrible death of the 
man Bertram. 

Cliff tried to explain his psychic 
experience, but Fr^ didn’t seem to 
understand. Beth was understanding 
and interested, using words like 
prana and chakram and astral. But 
she didn’t understand either, as his

probing of her mind revealed. The 
probing revealed other things, too: 
years of affection and growing de- 
votion through the divorce and fi- 
nally a helpless, longing love, so 
disturbing she. had shielded all her 
feelings carefully, even from her- 
self. 

And they filled Fred in on the 
embezzlement. Fawcett was in cus- 
tody, as were two of the three 
others — a junkie from the receiving 
dock named Bender, and the re- 
cords clerk Dalby Johnson, a com- 
pulsive pederast on whom Simons 
had an extensive file. He had con- 
fessed, blubbering. 

Simons himself was gone. In a 
rundown storefront at 7040 River- 
view police found a printing press 
and layout table and twenty differ- 
ent styles of paper and envelopes, 
none of them printed. Printed sam- 
ples they had from the files at Ohio 
River Power, plus they had 
Johnson’s confession. But not Si- 



mons. They had a good description 
of him, and the evidence to convict 
him of fraud, but that was all they 
had. 

'iVhen the Saturday sun was long 
gone. Cliff stood and stretched, 
watching the dance of lights in 
Beth’s aura. Feeling his gaze and 
taking his hint, she stood too, and 
gave him a long hug. He dragged 
his mind from her hungry thoughts 
and said goodnight to his friend. 

“We’d better let you get some 
rest, Freddie. This has been a lot of 
excitement, and they tell me you’re 
still a little weak.” 

“Oh, I’ll be back on the old 
solid-state treadmill Monday.” But 
Cliff could tell he was weary. He 
took Beth’s hand and it was warm, 
with a soft orange glow. Fred slip- 
ped down in the bed and gave a 
tired little wave. 

Together, they left the room.

AN END TO CRIME 



by Ed Ludwig 



It’s something everybody wants don’t 

they? 



It was a small saucer-shaped 
valley in California’s wine coun- 
try, lined with neat green rows of 
grape vines and basking in warm 
afternoon sunlight on this 12th 
day of September. In its center 
were a bright buff-colored farm- 
house and a winery and barn. 

Beneath the sign reading CE- 
LESTIAL SWISS VINEYARDS, 
Jeff Reed wiped perspiration 
from his forehead and gray stub- 
ble and paused at the side of the 
road. “Whew,” he said aloud in, 
at once, relief, exhaustion and 
anticipation. He looked down. 

The vineyard was quiet. In the 
distance a tractor moved, driven 
by a bearded man and spurting 
forth trails of dust. Someone, a 
woman, moved through the front 
yard of the house. 



A quiet house. Lonely. Inside, 
food, fresh clothing, money, 
wine. What a contrast to the cold 
streets of San Francisco, the 
smog of Los Angeles. And Jeff, 
he told himself, was an honest 
thief. He took only what he really 
needed. He really did not steal. 

He was sober after that 
week-long romp on the Embar- 
cadero. His mind was reasonably 
clear, his hands steadier than 
they’d been for months. 

“Yep, you did right coming 
here,” he murmured, “ — away 
from twenty years in bars and 
Good Will handouts and Salva- 
tion Army lectures. And don’t 
forget— they was talkin’ about a 
war in Frisco. Bombs and gas 
and all that.” 

He scuffled down from the 

77 




highway. Through a side of his 
vision flashed the figure of a boy 
leading a small brown horse 
throughout the yard. 

It might be well to enter the 
winery first, he thought. The 
building was -old, huge and par- 
tially concealed by oak trees. 

He found access: a small 
ground-level window in solid 
stone wall. Sweating, he inserted 
a stick in a corner of the window 
frame, pried it outward. The 
grating made him wince. It wasn't 
much of a window. It must be 
only for ventilation. 

He slipped in. Black coolness 
soothed him. Damn! It was dark 
in here. He lit a match and saw 
walls that must be two feet thick. 
And barrels of wine and hun- 
dreds of rows of bottles. Expen- 
sive wine— not rot-gut! 

But this was no time to think of 
wine. The world was still razor- 
sharp real, and there could be a 
war. He must get to the farm- 
house, find clean clothes and 
money. 

The match flicked out. He lit 
another. His hand began to 
shake. His shoulders twitched. 
He blinked furiously. 

Maybe a drink would help. Just 
one to warm his insides. He’d be 
able to work better, he knew. 

He used the little bottle-opener 
attachment of his pocket knife 
and managed to open a bottle. 

He drank. 

It became warm. He remem- 
bered hot days in Florida, a 
blonde from— where? And that 
park in San Jose, by the Post 
Office. 

He lit more matches, uncorked 
78 



another bottle of wine. The 
ground shook. Far away there 
was a great rumbling, a deep 
thunder. 

The shelved bottles shook. 
Some cracked and splattered to 
the stone floor. “Hey!” he said. “I 
didn’t do that. I’m not that drunk.” 
He drank. 

★ 



He awoke, eyes hot and tired, 
head throbbing. He still had 
matches and he found his way to 
a light switch and a flight of 
stairs. 

Abruptly he was outside. Sun- 
light stung his eyes. A realization 
came to his clouded senses. It 
was quiet. It was like floating on 
the bottom of a sea. There were 
only the soundless caress of a 
breeze, the movement of a 
trembling leaf. 

Then, a whinny. In the front- 
yard of the farmhouse lay the lit- 
tle horse he’d glimpsed yester- 
day. Its dark brown eyes were 
wild, its legs spread-eagled, its 
tail thrashing, all as if in a futile 
struggle to rise. Rivulets of blood 
trickled from its nostrils. 

“Little girl, what happened? 
God, what happened?” 

Jeff saw, in the distance, the 
tractor motionless in the fields, its 
bearded driver slumped over the 
wheel. He moved to the house, 
found .the woman on the porch. 
Inside, a man and a small boy. 
All very white and very dead. 

“God, I need a drink.” 

No, the TV first. Jeff flicked on 
the knob. The tube burst into 
light: there was no picture, no 



GALAXY 




sound. 

He remembered. The war. And 
yet no bombs, no real explo- 
sions? 

He stumbled outside to a Ford 
pickup. He turned on the car 
radio. Static, finally a voice, 
cracked and far-away: 

“...only people and living 
creatures . neutron bombs . 
West Coast, East, South- 
. structures still in- 
tact . Idaho and South Dakota 
sending help . end to hostil- 
ity . .” 

He remembered. This was re- 
ally why he’d left Frisco. 

“Well, Jeffy-boy,’’— His mother 
had called him that — “what do 
you do now?” 

He took a deep breath and an- 
swered himself. “You go on. 
Nothing, for you, has changed. 
You’ve been alone for twenty 
years. You take the pickup, food, 
money. You go to where people 
are, to Idaho.” 

Then the horse whinnied. 

She was still thrashing and 
struggling. She was caked in her 
own excrement. 

“Damn, I always hated 
horses.” 

He thought for a long moment. 
“Okay, I’ll help you before I go.” 

He found a bucket, filled it with 
water. The horse drank. He lo- 
cated hay in the barn and fed 
her. He tried to clean the dirty 
portions of her body. Her eyes 
were no longer wild. 

“Strange you made it,” he told 
her. “Nobody except you and 
me. With me it must have been 
the wine cellar, with you, ’cause 
you’re strong.” 



It wasn’t easy going back in- 
side the Ho.use of the Dead. But, 
he told himself, there would be 
many more Houses of Death. 

It was a beautiful home: clean 
carpets, shiny bright walls, soft 
chairs, a stereo, TV, a bicycle. 
He felt no sense of loss, for it 
seemed a place where the Other 
People lived. 

He found money and jewelry 
neatly stacked in a bureau 
drawer and a small wall safe. 
The challenge of the safe held 
no fascination. And the thrill of 
seeing the money and jewelry no 
longer existed. To hell with them. 

He did find canned food — stew 
and vegetables— which he be- 
lieved was still good. A rifle, an 
automatic .22, could be of use, 
although he’d always hated guns. 
He filled all empty canteens and 
jugs with water, for no matter 
where he was, he would still 
have to drink. 

Drink? 

Before starting his trip he’d 
better take a few bottles of wine, 
maybe a cask. Idaho was many 
miles away. 

In the wine cellar he found a 
hammer and chisel and a dozen 
empty bottles. The wine flowed 
easily and like cold blood. His 
hands began to shake. He 
sipped. The last time, he thought, 
the last time before Idaho. 

★ 

The next day the horse whin- 
nied. Jeff blinked in bright sun- 
light which was blotted away 
every second or two by wisps of 
dark clouds. 



79 




The horse remained sprawled, 
and Jeff brought her fresh water. 
She seemed to be trying to rise. 

But what if she never rose 
again? A cloud scudded across 
the sky. What if winter rains beat 
down upon the land, the farm, 
the horse? 

As Jeff thought, he found eggs 
inside the house, fried three and 
began to eat. Maybe he should 
build a shelter for the horse be- 
fore he left. Maybe, if he waited, 
he could help the horse into the 
barn. 

The eggs gagged him. In the 
next room and on the porch and 
in the tractor, were the farm 
people. He couldn’t take their 
food, their pickup, their wine 
while they lay in open air. 

He worked until the sky was 
dark — both with clouds and ap- 
proaching night. But the farm 
people were buried. 

It was time for a drink. 

★ 

The next day he started work 
on the shelter. The sky was 
overcast. Fresh corn was in the 
little garden behind the house, 
and it must be picked. 

He watered the horse and cur- 
ried her, and her brown eyes 
seemed to sparkle. Her legs 
moved more easily. 

Jeff muttered, “I think you're 
smiling at me. I think you might 
start to walk again pretty soon.^’ 

He was suddenly tired. “I got 
to go. Brown Eyes. Sorry. It’s a 
big world, and there are still 
people out there. I got to try to 
find ’em.” 



He turned away. 

Brown Eyes whinnied. 

Angrily, Jeff turned back scowl- 
ing. “Damn you, I can’t spend my 
life with a crippled horse and a 
wine cellar. I got to get movin’ 
on.” 

But first there was another 
cask of wine, and a watering of 
the horse, and a day passed, 
and two and three, and then a 
week. 

And it was a great many years 
before he moved on.

Things were hotting up on Jem — 
everybody wanted a piece of the 
pie . and there wasn’t enough pie 
to go around! 



JEM 

Synopsis 

At the Tenth General Assembly of 
the World Conference on Exobiol- 
ogy in Sofia, Bulgaria, DANNY 
DALEHOUSE hears for the first 
time of the semi-stellar object N-OA 
Bes-Bes Geminorum 8426 — 
sometimes called Kung’s Star — or 
Klong ... or JEM. Jem is inhabit- 
ed! Not with Just one intelligent 
species, but three: a race of sentient 
hydrogen-filled balloons, weasel- 
like burrowers and hardshelled ar- 
thropods. They are the first sentient 
life discovered anywhere in the uni- 
verse off Earth — and three of them . 

The race to explore Jem is on. 
All three of the great power blocs of 
terrestrial nations prepare expedi- 
tions: the Food countries, like the 
U.S.A. and the Soviet Union; the 
oil-rich Fuel bloc of Venezuela, En- 
gland and the Arab states; the 
People’s Republics, headed by 
China. 

In Sofia Dalehouse has met and 
had a brief affair with CAPTAIN 
MARJORIE MENNINGER, a young 
American Army officer with 
shadowy family connections into the 
mysterious high levels of govern- 
ment and intelligence. The two of 
them get into a scrape with the 
police and are rescued by ANA 
DIMITROVA, a translator for the 
Conference. Ana is Bulgarian, and 



therefore also a member of the 
Food Bloc, but she is in love with 
AHMED DULLA, the Pakistani who 
presented the report on Jem, who 
is a Peep. Marge Menninger prom- 
ises to see that a Food Bloc expedi- 
tion will go to Jem, and that 
Dalehouse will be on it. She keeps 
her promise, but the Peeps are 
quicker. Dulla’s expedition is the 
first to land. 

Arriving first is not all advan- 
tageous, however. Jem is full of 
perils. The chemistry of its biota is 
hostile to Terrestrial life, and most 
of the Peeps become quick casual- 
ties with severe allergic reactions. 
Some die. Dulla attempts to estab- 
lish contact with Krinpit, the ar- 
mored, crab-like creatures. The al- 
lergic process works both ways. 
Dulla becomes ill and helpless in 
the Krinpit village, and so do many 
of the Krinpit. Some of them die, 
including the male of the Krinpit 
name Sharn-igon. 

When Dalehouse' s expedition ar- 
rives on . Jem, its leaders have 
learned some lessons from the 
disasters that befell the Peeps. But 
the planet still has surprises. 
Dalehouse and his friend, the Rus- 
sian pilot KAPPELYUSHNIKOV, at- 
tempt to establish contact with the 
airborne race of balloonists. They 



82 



GALAXY 




have some success, and decide to 
build balloons of their own to join 
them in the sky. They even observe 
the balloonists spawning over their 
camp. Scientifically, this is a 
triumph. But as they breed, the bal- 
loonists secrete a spray which is 
both hallucinogenic and aph- 
rodisiac. It is the finest high on 
two worlds — and the whole Food 
Camp trips out. It isn’t a 
catastrophe — they survive it, if a lit- 
tle bedraggled— but it complicates 
relationships with the balloonists. 
Nevertheless, Dalehouse gets his 
balloon working and Joins the air- 
borne race in the sky. He meets the 
balloonist he names “CHARLIE" — 
an immense, hydrogen-fijlled sac 
bearing a tiny, insect-like body, but 
with a language, a social position 
as the leader of his flock and a 
capacity for friendship. 

The Fuel Bloc — the ‘ “Greasies’ ’ — 
have finally landed their expedition 
on Jem, and typically have all sorts 
of power machinery, even aircraft. 
Dalehouse goes with a helicopter 
pilot from the Greasies, BOYNE, to 
rescue Dulla and return him to his 
own base; at the same time, they 
transport the Krinpit, Sharn-igon, 
to the Greasy camp for study. But 
Sharn-igon is not willing to he 
studied. He kills his human guards 
and escapes to a nearby Krinpit vil- 
lage, rousing them to fight against 
the poisonous creatures from 
Earth. 

Meanwhile, on Earth the uneasy 
truce among the great power blocs 
is being stressed by quarrels over 
Jem. Marge Menninger gets the 
U.S.S.U. Eood Bloc expedition 
reinforced through her father, 
GODEREY MENNINGER, the 



shadowy head of American In- 
telligence. But the cost is immense — 
in money, in fuel, in raw materials 
and in political complications. 
Marge starts a program of develop- 
ing "trade goods” for the Jemman 
creatures. Most of the products are 
weapons. On the other side of the 
fence, God Menninger’ s opposite 
'number in the Greasy bloc, SIR 
TAM GULSMIT, throws obstacles 
in their way; and Marge Menninger 
decides to take more direct action. 
She bribes a defector from the 
Peoples’ Republics space program 
to plant a bomb to delay their rein- 
forcement of their Jemman colony. 
It succeeds better than she had 
planned. Their tachyon-transmission 
satellite is destroyed, and all their 
crews in transit are killed.

What Ana Dimitrova had seen of 
the United States was what she had 
seen of most of the world: airports, 
hotel rooms, meeting halls, city 
streets. So at first she looked 
around with lively interest as the 
electrobus whined along an eight- 
lane superhighway toward the place 
she had been ordered to report to. 
So much open space, not even 
farmed! And contrarily, so many 
places lined up one after another as 
they passed through communities, 
places to eat, places to sleep, places 
to drink, places to buy gas; what 
prodigious devourers these Ameri- 
cans must be, to keep them all 
flourishing! 

She touched the tiny microfiche 
from Ahmed, at the bottom of her 
blouse pocket. She had no reader 
for it, but she needed none. As al- 



JEM 



83 




ways it was formal, not very re- 
warding and extremely short: 

My dear Ana, 

1 appreciate the letters you 
have been sending and think of 
you often. 

With great affection, 
Dulla 

He could have spent a few P$ 
more, she thought resentfully, and 
then, as always, brought herself up 
sharply. Ahmed was from a poor 
country. Even- fiched and faxed, the 
cost per square centimeter of a letter 
from Kungson to Earth was very 
high. (But in her own letters she 
had poured money out like water. 
(But she could not judge him; she 
had not had the life experience of 
measuring every penny. (But it was 
not just the economy of space and 
money — how much more he could 
have said, if he had chosen, in even 
fewer words! — it was the economy 
of emotion that she begrudged.))) 
Three deep in parentheses, she took 
her mind off Dulla and resolved to 
think about more profitable subjects, 
and then realized the bus had 
stopped. 

Three uniformed Americans had 
entered by the driver’s seat. One of 
them gestured for silence and said, 
to the bus at large, “You people are 
welcome, and let’s see some l.D.” 
Craning her neck. Nan could see 
a barricade with two other soldiers 
standing by it. They were not at at- 
tention, but they were watching the 
bus quite carefully, and she ob- 
served that what had looked like a 
well-clipped hedge stretching away 
on both sides of the barrier had 



barbed wire inside it. How curious. 
They were treating this place as 
though it were some sort of military 
installation, rather than a center for 
preparing scientists and support per- 
sonnel for a peaceful expedition to 
Kungson. Big-power customs were 
so strange to her. When the MPs 
came to her she handed her passport 
over, and smiled at the tall black 
one who was studying it. He re- 
turned her look impassively. 
“Name?” 

Of course, it was right there, next 
to his thumb. “Ana Elena Dimi- 
trova.” 

“Place of birth?” 

“My place of birth? It is Marek, 
Bulgaria. That is a city south of 
Sofia, not far from the Yugoslavian 
border. ” 

“Put your thumb here, please.” 
She pressed against the little pad he 
extended to her and then on a 
square white card, which he tucked 
into her passport. “Your papers will 
be returned to you later,” he said, 
and then unbent. “You like to 
dance? There’s a nice group at the 
club tonight? Ask for me if you 
don’t see me. Name’s Leroy.” 

“Thank you, Leroy.” 

“See you later, honey.” He 
winked and moved along. Ana 
found a tissue and wiped the ink off 
her thumb wonderingly. These 
Americans were worse even than 
Sir Tam — not just the Americans, 
she corrected herself, thinking of 
the Vietnamese colonel and his 
agile tiny hands. Would it be like 
this always? Would it not be even 
worse, when she was part of the 
small colony on Kungson and they 
were all living in each other’s pock- 
ets anyway?

But at least then Ahmed would 
be somewhere near! In the wrong 
encampment, yes. But she would 
find a way to see him. Let her get 
just on the same planet with him 
again, and they would be together! 
It made the whole ordeal seem 
worthwhile. 

★ 

By the next day, not even that 
made it seem altogether attractive. 
She could not have attended Leroy’s 
dance that night if she wanted to. 
There was no time. Issue of new 
clothing: “You will wear these here 
fatigues at all times, except when 
instructed by your instructors.” As- 
signment to quarters: “You will 
maintain cleanliness at all times. At 
all times all personal possessions 
are to be kept in yolir footlockers. ” 
Preliminary briefing: “You will fall 
out at oh six hundred hours for 
breakfast. From oh seven hdndred 
to eleven hundred you will partici- 
pate in your individual refresher 
courses of instruction in the applica- 
tion of your sp>ecialized skills on 
Klong. From twelve hundred to six- 
teen thirty you will complete your 
survival course to teach you your 
survival skills for surviving in the 
environment of Klong. From eigh- 
teen hundred to lights out at 
twenty-two hundred you will con- 
duct your personal affairs except 
when required to participate in addi- 
tional refresher courses or survival 
instruction. Weekends? Who’s the 
guy who wants to know about 
weekends? Oh, you. Well, there 
aren’t any weekends here.” By the 
time all that was finished it was 
nearly midnight, and then Ana 



dragged her suitcase to the tiny, 
bare room that had been assigned to 
her, coldly furnished, like the 
showcase cell in a county jail, to 
find out that her roommate was the 
Vietnamese colonel. Even here rank 
had its privilege. But Ana was hav- 
ing none of it, and so it was back to 
the billeting office and a good deal 
of argument, and by the time she 
was able to get to sleep in a new 
room with a female roommate it 
was nearly two. 

Breakfast was discouragingly 
huge, eggs and sausage and cereal 
and breads with jams and mar- 
malades and peanut butter in opened 
liter cans on every table, and for 
dessert they spent an hour receiving 
inoculations. None of them were 
painful, but from the grins and 
jokes of the medics Ana knew that 
they would be later on. And then 
she lined up with the other two 
dozen of her detachment in a wet, 
cold wind, and they were marched 
off to their various refresher courses 
of instruction in the application of 
thier specialized skills. Ana's tiny 
group included the Canadian woman 
and two men unknown to her, and 
they wound through the camp 
streets, past a baseball field and a 
bowling alley, between barracks and 
anonymous buildings with armed 
guards patrolling before them, out 
into an open field half a kilometer 
square. In the center of it was a sort 
of tethered balloon shaped like a 
sausage, fifty meters long, with 
guards around the perimeter and 
three of them grouped before the 
entrance. There was a fence sur- 
rounding the whole thing, and more 
guards at the gate in the fence; and 
before any of them were permitted 



JEM 



85 




inside they had to go through the 
same tedious, business of checking 
I.D.’s one more time. 

Off to one side there was a tall 
chimney, eoupled to the main tent 
by a flexible .plastic tube. The 
chimney roared. Though there was 
no smoke, the shimmering at the 
top of it showed some very hot 
gases boiling high into the air out of 
it. It did not seem to serve any 
function that Ana could guess. But 
then neither did the weapons that all 
the permanent party personnel car- 
ried. Who were they meant to be 
used against? What pxissible enemy 
threatened a training base for a sci- 
entific expedition which, after all, 
was in a sense the propierty of the 
entire world? 

When she finally got through the 
gates and the guards she found her- 
self in a long open shed, covered 
with the opaque white plastic of the 
bubble. The atmosphere was damp 
and heavy, filled with strange 
smells, and the lighting was sultry- 
red. At first she could see very lit- 
tle, but she was aware that people 
were moving about between rows of 
what seemed to be smaller, transpar- 
ent bubbles. The lighting came 
from a bank of gas-glow tubes, all 
red, and there was not very much of 
it. 

And then she saw the balloonist. 

She recognized it at once; there 
could not be another creature as 
strange as that anywhere in the 
universe! But it look^ — damaged. It 
was tethered inside a cage. Its great 
bubble was throbbing but almost 
limp, sagging against the ground. 
She stared, fascinated, and saw that 
a flexible plastic coupling had been 
taped neatly to a hole in the gasbag. 

86 



and the plastic line went to a cylin- 
der of gas. A woman with a tape 
recorder was crouched by the cylin- 
der, adjusting the gas valve as she 
listened to the balloonist’s plaintive 
song. 

No wonder the voice sounded so 
faint! He was operating at a fraction 
of normal pressure, far too little to 
let him fly, only enough to let him 
gasp a sobbing sort of song. The 
woman looked up and said, 
“You’re Dimitrova? I’m Julia Ar- 
den, and this — ’’ pointing at the 
balloonist — “is Shirley. She’s sing- 
ing about her childhood right now.’’ 

Ana shook hands courteously, 
staring at the sad, wrinkled little 
creature. Those sounds did not seem 
like language! She could not imag- 
ine understanding them, much 
less translating them, no matter how 
many times they halved her brain! 
She- said doubtfiilly, “I will do my 
best. Mis Arden, but do you think 
you really can teach me to talk to 
that?” 

“Me? Maybe not. I’ll help, and 
so will the computers, but the one 
who’s going to teach you is Shirley 
herself. She loves to sing to us. 
Poor thing. She doesn’t have 
much else to do with her time, does 
she?” 

Nan looked at the creature for a 
moment and then burst out, “No, 
but what a shame, really! Can you 
not see she is in pain?” 

The other woman shrugged. 
“What do you want me to do about 
it?” Her tone was less hostile than 
defensive. “I don’t suppose Shirley 
vounteered for this duty, but then 
neither did I. Your job is learning 
her language, Dimitrova, and let’s 
get on with it.” 



GALAXY 




“But to see a creature in pain — ” 

Julia Arden laughed, and then 
shook her head. “Sweetie, you only 
got here last night. Wait a day or 
two. Then you can talk to me about 
pain.” 

★ 

From 0700 to 1100 Ana Dimi- 
trova stretched the muscles of her 
mind until she thought she would die 
of it, and from 1200 to 1630 she 
balanced the diet by doing the same 
to her body. Julia Arden had been 
right. Within forty-eight hours Ana 
was an expert on pain. She woke up 
each morning with a hazy overcast 
of brightness that she knew was the 
foretaste of migraine. She went to 
bed each night with so many aches, 
throbs, and bruises that it took all 
the will she had to refrain from 
swallowing the pills they had given 
her. She could not afford pills; she 
needed her mind alert. Even while 
she slept, because sleeping was only 
another kind of study for Ana, with 
the taped calls of the balloonists 
murmuring under her pillow all 
night long. 

The headaches, all right, they 
were something she was used to. 
Worse than that, the shots were 
producing their effect. Her skin was 
covered with little blisters and 
bumps, some that itched, some that 
were tender, some downright pain- 
ful every moment of time. Not just 
pain. She wheezed and coughed. 
Her eyes ran uninterruptedly, and so 
did her nose. She was not alone; 
everyone in her group was having 
the same reaction to the allergy 
shots. If this was the prophylaxis, 
what could the illness itself be 



like? And then she saw the holos of 
the unfortunate Peeps who had died 
of their reactions, before the coun- 
termeasures had been developed, 
and they defined for her the dif- 
ference between prophylaxis and re- 
ality. It was not comforting to her. 
It was terrifying. How had Ahmed 
fared in all this? He had said noth- 
ing in his letters, but perhaps he 
was only being brave. 

And every afternoon, feel well, 
feel ill, no matter, there she was out 
on the exercise field. Pushups and 
five hundred meter runs, obstacle 
courses and rope climbing. Her 
hands were raw, then blistered, then 
calloused. Even through the cov- 
eralls her knees were scraped 
bloody. Everywhere on arms and 
legs where there was not a pimple 
or blister there was a bruise. 

To be sure, she scolded herself, 
for all of this there was a clear pur- 
pose! Kungson was no picnic dell, 
it was a place of strange and 
perhaps lethal dangers. These mea- 
sures, however brutal, were only to 
help her meet those dangers and 
conquer them. If she had not volun- 
teered for the job, she had also not 
refused it when offered. 

And, finally, the most potent ar- 
gument of all. It was the way to 
Ahmed. So she did her best, all the 
time, and was secretly proud of the 
fact that some of the others were 
doing less well than she. The tiny 
Vietnamese colonel, Nguyen Dao 
Tree, fell in a heap from the knot- 
ted ropes one afternoon and was 
taken to hospital. (But he was back 
the next day, limping but game.) 
One woman, an older one, perhaps 
almost forty, fell flat on her face 
halfway up a rocky hill; she was 



JEM 



87 




taken away too, and she did not re- 
turn. 

As days became weeks the 
fatigue lessened, the bruises healed, 
the reactions to the antiallergens di- 
minished. The headaches stayed the 
same, but Ana was used to them, 
and she learned to take part in the 
friendly chatter in the messhall. 
Always there were such stories! 
They were going to Kungson on a 
one-way trip and were expected to 
breed there and raise a new race of 
humans. They were not going to 
Kungson at all, but to a new planet, 
not yet announced or even named. 
They were not going into space at 
all. They were going to be 
parachuted onto the Scottish coast 
to commandeer the oil refineries. 
They were going to Antarctica, 
which was going to become a new 
Food Bloc colony since a process 
had been discovered for melting the 
ice cap. At first Ana was frightened 
by such stories. Then amused, then 
bored; she began making up stories 
of her own, and found them as 
quickly passed along as any other. 
But some of the stories seemed 
true. Even some terrible ones, an 
unexplained accident in space that 
had destroyed the Peeps’ resupply 
ships and even their tachyon-transit 
satellite itself. She let herself be late 
for dinner that night, to listen to the 
evening news; sure enough, it was 
official. How terrifying! What 
would it mean to Ahmed? But then 
the news went on to say that the 
expeditions of the Fuel and Food 
Blocs had offered help to the expedi- 
tion of the Peoples’ Republics, 
and, with her heart full. Ana hur- 
ried to the dining room, demanded 
attention and proposed thay they 

88 



all sign a letter of sympathy and 
good wishes to their colleagues of 
the Peoples’ Bloc. The faces all 
turned to her, then whispered 
among themselves, half embar- 
rassed, but in the long run they let her 
write the letter and they all signed. 
The next afternoon her training 
supervisor even excused her early to 
carry the document to the office of 
the camp commandant. He listened 
to her blankly, read the document 
three times and then promised to 
send it through channels. At dinner 
that night she reported glowingly 
what had happened, but her news 
was drowned in other news. There 
were three new stories. First, that 
they were to receive a large ship- 
ment of new trainees the next day. 
Second, that a date had been set for 
their flight to Kungson, less than 
three weeks in the future. And 
third, contradictorily, that the whole 
project was about to be canceled. 

Such stories! Ana stood up an- 
grily, rapping her fork against her 
thick chinaware cup. “How can 
you all believe this nonsense?’’ she 
demanded. “How can all of these 
be true at once?’’ But not many of 
the others were paying attention, 
and she felt a tug at her elbow. 

It was the colonel, who had, as 
he often did, squeezed in between 
Ana and her roommate at the table 
in order to try his fortunes one more 
time. “Sweet, beautiful Ana,’’ he 
said, “don’t make a fool of your- 
self. 1 know something of these 
stories, -and they are all true.’’ 

★ 

That one of them was true was 
proved the next morning. Sixty-five 



GALAXY 




more persons arrived at the base, 
and Ana knew one of them! It was 
the blonde woman who was 
Godfrey Menninger’s daughter. 

Of course, everything was turned 
topsy-turvy. All of the billeting ac- 
comodations were changed to make 
room for the new arrivals — no, not 
for that reason alone. Ana realized, 
because most of the new ones, and 
quite a few of the old ones, were 
housed in another barracks half a 
kilometer away. Ana lost her WAC 
corporal roommate, and feared at 
once she would get Colonel Nguyen 
hack again. But that did not hap- 
pen. He went to the other barracks, 
and Ana was moved in with the 
Canadian woman whose specialty 
seemed to be growing food crops in 
ufiusual circumstances. Marge Men- 
ninger eaught sight of Ana in the 
crowd and waved to her. But they 
had no chance to speak — not that 
Ana had any particular reason to 
want to speak to the American, 
anyway — and, in all the confusion, 
she was nearly an hour late arriving 
at her morning session with the 
female balloonist. 

The creature was no longer a 
sjjecimen to Ana. She was a friend. 
Into the cognitive half of Ana’s 
brain the songs of the balloonists 
had poured. In the first day she had 
learned to understand a few simple 
phrases, in a week to communicate 
abstract thoughts; now she was al- 
most fluent. Ana had never thought 
of herself as having any kind of a 
singing voice, but the balloonist 
was not critical. They sang to each 
other for hours on end, and more 
and more Shirley’s songs were sad, 
and despairing, and sometimes even 
disconnected. She was, she told 



Ana, the last survivor of the dozen 
or more of the species who had 
been wrenched from Kungson and 
hurled to this inhospitable place. 
She did not expect to live much 
longer. She sang to Ana of the 
sweetness of warm pollen in a damp 
cloud, of the hot singing sadness of 
egg-spraying, of the communal joy 
of the flock in chorus. She told Ana 
that she would never sing in the 
flock again. She was thrice right. 
She would not have dared sing, 
with her voice so pitifully harsh and 
weak, as the gas-pump gave her 
only faltering tones. She had no 
chance of being returned to 
Kungson. And she knew death was 
near; and two days later she was 
dead. Ana arrived at the zoo to find 
her cage empty, and Julia Arden 
supervising the sterilization of its 
parts. “Don’t take on,’’ she advised 
gruffly. “You’ve learned all you 
need to know.’’ 

“It is not for the learning that I 
weep. It is because I have lost 
someone dear. ’’ 

“Christ. Get out of here, Dimi- 
trova. How did they let a Jerk like 
you into this project in the first 
place? Crying over a dead fartbag 
and sending love-letters to the 
Peeps — you’re really out of it!’’ 

Ana marched back to the bar- 
racks, threw herself down on her 
cot and allowed herself to weep as 
she had not done in months — for 
Shirley, for Ahmed, for the world 
and for herself. “Out of it,’’ de- 
scribed her feelings exactly. How 
had everything become so hideous 
and complex? 

That afternoon in the exercise 
field was an ordeal. The physical 
strain was no longer a real problem. 



JEM 



89 




but for some days now the “exer- 
cises” had taken a new turn. All of 
them, her own original detachment 
as well as the new arrivals, had 
been working less to strengthen 
their muscles and reflexes than to 
learn to handle unfamiliar 
equipment — unfamiliar to Ana, at 
least; she observed that all of the 
new people, and some of the old, 
had obviously had experience with 
it already. Such equipment! Heavy 
hoses like water-cannon, 
backpacked tanks and nozzles like 
flame-throwers, lasers, even 
grenade-launchers. For what 
grotesque purpose was all this in- 
tended? Tight-lippped, Ana did as 
she was told. Repeatedly she found 
herself in difficulties and had to be 
bailed out by one of the others. The 
colonel sav^ her from incinerating 
herself with a flame-thrower, and 
Sergeant Sweggert had to rescue her 
when the recoil of her water-cannon 
knocked her off her feet. “Please 
do not concern yourself,” she 
gasped furiously, pulling herself 
erect and reaching once more for 
the hose. “I am quite all right.” 
“Hell you are,” he said amiably. 
“Lean into it more, honey, you 
hear? It doesn’t take muscle, just a 
little brains.” 

“I do not agree.” 

He shook his head. “Why do you 
get so uptight, Annie?” 

“1 do not like being trained in 
the use of weapons!” 

“What weapons?” He grinned at 
her. “Don’t you know this stuff is 
only to use against vermin? Colonel 
Menninger spelled it all out for us. 
We don’t want to kill any sentients, 
that’s against the law, and besides 
we’ll all get our asses in a crack. 

90 



But all the intelligent ones got little 
like cousins, crab-rats and air-sharks 
and things that dig around in the 
dirt and come out and chew your 
ass off. Those are what we’re going 
to use this stuff for.” 

“In any event,” said Ana, “I do 
not require assistance from you. 
Sergeant. Even if I believed you, or 
your Colonel Menninger, which I 
do not.” 

Sweggert looked past her and 
pursed his lips. “Hello, there, Col- 
onel, ” he said. “We was just talk- 
ing about you.” 

“So I noticed,” said Margie 
Menninger ’s voice. Ana turned 
slowly, and there she was. Looking, 
Ana observed without regret, quite 
poorly. The shots were having their 
way with her, and her face was 
broken out in cerise blotches, her 
eyes were red and running and her 
hair had dark roots. “Get on with 
it. Sergeant,” she said. “Dimi- 
trova, see me in my room after 
chow.” 

She turned away, and raised her 
voice. “All right, all of you,” she 
cried. “Get your asses down! Let’s 
see how you crawl!” 

Rebelliously Ana dropped to the 
ground and practiced the way of 
worming herself across an open 
field that she had learned the day 
before. These were infantry tactics! 
What nonsense, for a scientific ex- 
pedition! She conserved her anger 
carefully, and it lasted her the rest 
of the afternoon, through dinner and 
right up' to the moment she knocked 
on Menninger’s door in that other 
barracks halfway across the base. 

“Come in.” Lt. Col. Menninger 
was sitting at a desk in a white, 
fluffy dressing gown, rimless 



GALAXY 




granny-glasses on her nose, a half- 
eaten dinner tray pushed to one 
side. She looked up from some pa- 
pers and said, “T^e a seat, Ana. 
Do you smoke? Would you like a 
drink?” 

The angry fires inside Ana 
banked themselves. But they were 
still ready to blaze out. ‘‘No, thank 
you,” she said, in general, to all. 

Margie stood up and poured her- 
self a scant shot of whiskey. She 
would have preferred marijuana, but 
she did not care to share a Joint 
with this Bulgarian. She sipped a 
centimeter off the top of the drink 
and said, “Personal question. What 
have you got against Sweggert?” 

“I have nothing against Sergeant 
Sweggert. I simply do not care to 
make love with him.” 

“What are you, Dimitrova, some 
maximum women ’s-libber? You 
don’t have to ball him on the parade 
ground. Just let him give you a 
hand when he wants to.” 

“Colonel Menninger, ” Ana said 
precisely, “are you ordering me to 
encourage his sexual overtures so 
that 1 can complete the obstacle 
course more readily?” 

“I am not ordering you to do 
diddly-shit, Dimitrova. What is it 
with you? Sweggert comes on to 
everything with a hole in it. It’s his 
nature. He comes on to me, too. I 
could put the son of a bitch in 
Leavenworth for the places his 
hands have been on the drill field. 
But I won’t, because he’s a good 
sol — because he’s essentially a good 
person. He’ll help you if you let 
him. You can always tell him to 
fuck off later on. ” 

“This 1 consider immoral. Col- 
onel Menninger.” 



Margie finished her drink and 
poured half of another. “You’re not 
too happy here, are you. Ana?” 
“That is correct. Mis Menninger. 
I did not ask for this assignment.” 
“1 did.” 

“Yes, no doubt, perhaps you did, 
but I — ” 

“No, that’s not what 1 mean. I 
asked for it for myself, but I also 
asked for you, too. I picked you out 
by name. Ana, and it took hell’s 
own convincing to make the Bulga- 
rians turn you loose. They think 
you’re pretty great at translating.” 
She tossed down the rest of the 
drink and took off her glasses. 
“Look, Ana, I need you. This pro- 
ject is important to me. It should be 
important to you, too, if you have a 
spark of patriotism in your body.” 

‘ 'Patriotism ? ’ ’ 

“Loyalty, then,” said Margie 
impatiently. “Loyalty to our bloc. I 
know we come from different coun- 
tries, but we stand for the same 
thing. ” 

Ana found herself more puzzled 
than angry by this strange Ameri- 
can. She tried to sort her feelings 
out and express them exactly. 
“Bulgaria is my home,” she began. 
“I love my home. The Food 
Bloc— that is a much more abstract 
thing. Mis Menninger. I understand 
that in a world of two hundred na- 
tions there must be alliances, and 
that one owes one’s allies some sort 
of allegiance. Or at least courtesy. 
But I cannot say 1 feel loyalty. Not 
to the Food Bloc.” 

“To the whole human race then, 
honey,” said Margie. “Don’t you 
see it? You just said it for yourself, 
a world of two hundred nations. But 
Klong can be a world of one nation!

No Hghting. No spies. No cloak- 
and-dagger shit. Who colonized 
America?” 

“What?” It took Ana a moment 
to realize she was supposed to an- 
swer the question. “Why — the En- 
glish? Before them, the Dutch.” 

“And before them maybe the Ital- 
ians, with Columbus, and maybe, 
for Christ’s sake, anybody you 
like — the Vikings, the Polynesians, 
the Chinese. Who knows? But the 
people who live in America now 
ire the Americans. And that’s 
who’s going to living on Klong in 
another generation or two. The 
Klongans. Or whatever they call 
themselves. A single race of human 
beings. Never mind where they 
come from here! They’ll be all the 
same, all part of the same 
wonderful — well, dream. 1 don’t 
mind calling it a dream. But you 
and I can make it come true. Ana. 
We can leam how to live on Klong. 
We can build a world without na- 
tional barriers, and without the kind 
of senseless competition and rapac- 
ity that has ruined this one. Do you 
know what it means to have a 
whole new world to start over on?” 

Ana was silent. “I — I have had 
some thoughts of that sort myself,” 
she admitted. 

“Of course you have. And I want 
to make it happen. I want to lay the 
foundations for a world society that 
understands planning and conversa- 
,tion and cooperation. Do you know 
how much we’re putting into this? 
Four ships. Nearly ninety people. 
Thirty-five tons of equipment. The 
invasion of Europe cost less than this 
one launch, and, believe me, ev- 
erybody involved is screaming. It 
costs too much. It upsets the Peeps. 

92 



The Greasies will raise their prices. 
We need the resources to solve the 
problems of the cities. Half the 
Congress would like to call if off 
tomorrow — ” 

“One has heard rumors,” Ana 
said cautiously, “that the launch 
may be canceled. ” 

Margie hesitated and a shadow 
crossed her face. “No,” she cor- 
rected. “that will not happen, be- 
cause it is too important. But that is 
why 1 asked for you. Ana. If we 
can send ninety people, they must 
be the best ninety people there are. 
And you are the best translator 1 
could find.” She reached out and 
touched Ana’s sleeve. “Do you un- 
derstand?” 

Ana drew away as soon as she 
could without giving offense, her 
thoughts uncertain. “Y-yes,” she 
said unwillingly, and then: “But, 
on the other hand, no. What you 
say is most persuasive, Mis Men- 
ninger, but what has it to do with 
the use of flame-throwers and other 
weapons? Are we to build this fine 
monolithic world by destroying ev- 
eryone else?” 

“Of course not, Ana!” cried 
Margie, with as much shock and 
revulsion in her voice as she knew 
how to put there. “1 give you my 
word!” 

There was silence. “1 see,” said 
Ana at last. “You give me your 
word . ’ ’ 

“What else would you have me 
do?” • 

Ana said thoughtfully, “One has 
so little contact with the rest of the 
world here. 1 would like very much 
an opportunity to discuss this with 
others. Perhaps with my own dele- 
gation at the United Nations?” 



GALAXY 




“Why not?” exclaimed Margie. 
She looked thoughtful for a moment, 
and then nodded. “I’ll tell you 
what. As soon as training’s over, 
we’re all going to get three days 
off. I’m going to New York myself. 
Come with me. We’ll eat some de- 
cent food, go to a few parties. And 
you can talk it over with anyone 
you like. Agreed?” 

Ana hesitated. At last, unwill- 
ingly, she said, “All right. Miss 
Menninger. That sounds attractive.” 
It did not, for many reasons, but as 
a Just person Ana had to concede 
that it sounded at least fair. 

“Fine, honey. Now, if you don’t 
mind. I’m overdue for a long, hot 
bath.” 

Margie locked the door behind 
the Bulgarian woman and ran her- 
self a tub with some satisfaction. 
What the stupid prunt didn’t know 
was that she was leaving Camp De- 
trick directly for the launch pad. The 
next chance she would have to talk 
anything over with anybody would 
be on Klong, and there let her say 
whatever she liked. 

★ 

Ana Dimitrova sat with her eyes 
closed in a broad, low room, el- 
bows on a ring-shaped table, head 
in her hands, earphones on her 
head. Her lips were moving. Her 
head twitched from side to side as 
she tried to match the rhythms of 
the taped balloonist song that was 
coming over the headset. It was 
very difficult, in large part because 
it was not a balloonist’s voice mak- 
ing the sounds. It was a krinpit’s. 
The tape had been made several 
weeks before, when Detrick’s last 



surviving krinpit had had no one 
left to talk to but Shirley, the one 
surviving balloonist. 

But her name had not been Shir- 
ley. Her name, rather beautifully, 
had been mo’ahi' i ba alu i, which 
meant something like Sweetly 
Golden Cloud-Bearer. Krinpit rasps 
and tympani did not easily form the 
balloonist sounds. But Shirley had 
understood him — no. Ana corrected 
herself, Mo’ahi’i Ba’alu’i had un- 
derstood him. Ana was determined 
to do the same, and so she played 
and replayed sections of the tape: 

Ma’iya’a hi’i — these creatures un- 
like us — hu’u ha’iye’i — are vicious 
animals. 

And Cloud-Bearer’s response; 
Ni'u'a main na’a hu'iha. They 
have killed my song. 

Ana pushed the headphones off 
her ears and allowed herself to rub 
her eyes. The headaches were very 
bad tonight. And this awful room! 
Twenty headsets and tape-control 
panels before twenty identical 
hard-backed chairs, all around the 
ring. So bleak! So unsympathetic! 

Unsympathetic? Ana clucked her 
lips at herself. That was one of the 
English language ’s booby-trap 
words: Sympathetic, simpatico. 

They, sounded so much alike. But 
they did not mean the same thing, 
and it was embarrassing to a trans- 
lator of Ana’s skills to fall into the 
blunder of confusing them. It 
proved she was too tired to work any 
more this night, and so decisively 
she switched off the tape, hung the 
earphones on their hook and stood 
up to go. She intended to wish a 
courteous good night to those few 
other eager project personnel who 
had shared her desire to put in over- 



JEM

time at the tape ring. But there 
weren’t any. They had all left while 
she was concentrating. 

★ 

It was nearly eleven o’clock! In 
six hours she would have to be get- 
ting out of bed! 

Hurrying down the empty com- 
pany street toward her room. Ana 
paused halfway, changed course and 
entered the day room. Really, these 
headaches were too bad! But there 
was a dispensing machine in the 
day room, and sometimes one of the 
American soft drinks containing caf- 
feine would constrict the blood ves- 
sels and reduce the thumping, tump- 
ing throb long enough for her to get 
to sleep. 

But as she dropped a dollar into 
the machine and waited for the cup 
to fill, it seemed to her that coming 
here had been a mistake, after all. 
Such an ear-drubbing of noise! A 
dozen couples were dancing fren- 
ziedly to a stereo at one end of the 
room. At the other a young Oriental 
man had a guitar, and a group was 
singing with him, quite at cross- 
purposes to the music on the stereo. 
Quite uncaring. And even more 
noise came from the television al- 
cove: a babble of excited voices, 
laughter, what could they be watch- 
ing? She drifted closer to peer at the 
screen. Someone was lifting a pil- 
lowcase out of a sonic washer and 
exclaiming rapturously over its pris- 
tine shine. Were these people ex- 
cited over a commercial? 

“Oh, Ana,’’ cried her room- 
mate, elbowing toward her. “You 
missed it. She was wonderful. ’’ 

“What? What did I miss? Who 



was wonderful?’’ 

“Lieutenant-Colonel Menninger. 
It was really super. You know,” 
confided the woman, “I never re- 
ally liked her. But tonight she was 
just beautiful. She was on the six 
o’clock news. It was just a little 
person-to-pierson interview, like a 
follow-up to a story about Jem. I 
don’t know why they picked her. 
But I’m glad they did! She said 
such wonderful things! She said 
Jem gave hope to all the unhappy 
people of the world. She said it was 
a planet where all the old hatreds 
could be forgotten. A place 
where — what did she say? — yes, a 
place where each child could elect a 
morality and an idea, and have the 
space and the freedom to live his 
life by it!” 

Ana coughed Coca-Cola in a fine 
spray into her cupped hand. “Col- 
onel Menninger said that?” she 
gasped. 

“Yes, yes. Ana, and she said it 
beautifully. We were all touched. 
Even people like Stud Sweggert and 
Nguyen the Tryin’ were really 
moved. I mean, they even kept their 
hands to themselves. And the news- 
caster said something about sending 
troops to Jem, and Colonel Men- 
hinger said, T’m a soldier myself. 
Every country has soldiers like me, 
and every one of us prays we’ll 
never have anything to do. But on 
Jem we can do something useful! 
Something for peace, not for de- 
struction, Please let us do it.’ — 
What?” 

Ana had been marveling to her- 
self in Bulgarian. “No, no, please 
go on,” she said. 

“Well. And just now they re- 
peated parts of it on the late report. 



94 



GALAXY 




and they said the public response 
has been incredible. Telegrams, 
phone calls. To the White House, 
and the U.N., and the networks — I 
don ’t know where all . ” 

Ana forgot her headache. 
“Perhaps I have been doing Colonel 
Menninger an injustice. Truly, I am 
amazed.” 

“Well, I am too! But she made 
me feel really good about what 
we’re doing, and everyone’s talking 
about it!” 

And they were. Not only in the 
barracks dayroom. Senator Lenz’s 
phones were ringing, and it was 
constituents urging him to make sure 
the heroes on Jem got support. 
Newsrooms around the country 
were watching the electronic tally of 
calls from the public; Jem, Jem! 
Spot pollsters were reporting great 
and growing public concern. God 
Menninger ’s phone rang only once, 
but the person on the other end was 
the President of the United States. 
When he hung up Menninger ’s face 
was tense and stem, but then it re- 
laxed and he broke into a smile. 
“Honey,” he said to empty space, 
“damn your black heart, you do 
your old man proud. ” 

XIll 

For twenty kilometers Charley 
and his flock tried to follow the lit- 
tle biplane as it chugged and 
bounced through the sky of Jem. 
No use. The balloonists soared 
high, swooped low, found winds 
that carried them toward the heat 
pole, but never fast enough to keep 
up. Charlie sang a mournful 
farewell song into his radio as they 
turned away, and the sound pene- 



trated even the noisy rattle of the lit- 
tle engine inside the plane. “Too 
much noise,” shouted Kap- 
pelyushnikov cheerfully into Danny 
Dalehouse’s ear. “Turn off, 
please?” 

“Let me say good-bye first.” 
Dalehouse sang into the tiny radio, 
then switched it off. Far behind, 
and half a kilometer overhead, the 
flock bobbed acknowledgment. 
Dalehouse craned his neck to see 
forward, but the camp of the 
Greasies was of course nowhere yet 
in sight. They were flying almost di- 
rectly toward the Heat Pole — 
“southeast” by the convention of 
considering the poles of rotation 
north and south, however irrelevant 
that was to compasses and 
sextants — and it was uphill almost 
all the way. How foolish of the 
Greasies to locate their camp in the 
least hospitable part of the planet! 
But who could figure why the 
Greasies did things? 

Kappelyushnikov leaned over and 
slapped him on the shoulder. “You 
wish to puke?” he called encourag- 
ingly, pointing over the side of the 
cockpit. Dalehouse shook his head. 
“Is all right, you know,” Cappy 
went on. “Is little rough, yes. We 
are fighting winds, not making love 
to them like in balloon. But you 
have truly outstanding aircraft tech- 
nician in charge!” 

“I’m not complaining.” And in 
fact, he had no reason to complain. 
The biplane was a technological 
marvel on Klong — on Jem, he re- 
minded himself, as they were sup- 
posed to call it now. At least they 
were flying! The Greasy camp was 
hard to reach any other way. There 
were no cars on Jem, because no 



JEM 



95 




roads. Only a tracked vehicle could 
go very far, and even the Greasies 
did not have them to spare. Be- 
cause, in their pigheaded way, the 
Greasies had camped ten kilometers 
from the nearest usable water, boats 
were out. You could fly there for 
this semi-summit meeting that was 
supposed to make everyone on Jem 
friends again. Or you could walk. 
And Dalehouse spared a thought of 
compassion for the poor, proud, 
pedestrian Peeps, who were no 
doubt doing just that somewhere 
below. 

So just to be flying was a 
triumph, although he wished Gappy 
had not brought up the subject of 
airsickness. It was not the motion 
that was bothering him as much as 
the food they had been eating. With 
twenty-two more mouths to feed, 
the old catch-as-catch-can meal 
style was down the drain. Unfortu- 
nately, the new people had brought 
their appetites, but they had forgot- 
ten to pack a chef to satisfy them. 
The food was unbearable. No one 
dared complain. The person who 
bitched would be the next cook. 

Still, the community was grow- 
ing. The third resupply ship had 
brought a great deal. This sputtering 
little two-winged airplane, folded 
and stacked and foolish-looking, but 
demonstrably workable, because it 
was working. The little plutonium- 
powered machines and instruments 
that had given Morrissey sensors to 
study the Creepies in their tunpels 
under ground and Dalehouse him- 
self radios to pass on to Charlie. A 
new Argus orbiter to photograph 
clouds and help them predict the 
weather. Or at least to guess at it a 
little more accurately. 



It had even helped them in their 
attempts to make contact with sen- 
tients. Sort of. Charlie was de- 
lighted with his crossbow and his 
radio. Jim Morrissey had taken 
another tack. He had used the new 
power auger to make three widely 
spaced holes along a Creepy burrow. 
The end holes held soft charges of 
explosives, the center one a hose 
connected to the exhaust of the au- 
ger’s little gasoline putt-putt. When 
Morrissey blew the charges he sealed 
both ends of that section of the tun- 
nel, and the carbon monoxide 
caught four burrowers before they 
could dig away. By then they were 
no good for Dalehouse ’s purposes 
any more, of course, but they were 
a joy to Morrissey. 

Even further marvels were on 
their, way. The third resupply had 
brought eight metric tons of equip- 
ment, but according to the tachtran 
messages the next would bring 
nearly fifty, plus maybe a hundred 
additional personnel. It would be a 
city! The summons to the meeting 
at the Fuel camp had not only been 
a welcome tour of Jem, it had been 
a reprieve from the tedium of erect- 
ing tents to receive the reinforce- 
ments. 

What the tachtran had failed to 
say was just what the reinforce- 
ments would be used for. They cer- 
tainly needed any number of 
specialists they didn’t have. A 
cook. A dentist. Some better- 
looking women. A better 
translator — Reminded, Dalehouse 
leaned back to see how Harriet was 
faring behind him. 

The translator was most uncom- 
fortably curled up in a space no 
more than a meter square, and stud- 



96 



GAIAXY 




ded, at that, with bolts and levers 
that must have been tattooing Har- 
riet’s hips and ribs indelibly. If she 
had been anyone else Dalehouse 
would have thought of some 
friendly, commiserating remark. For 
Harriet he could find none. Her 
eyes were closed. Her expression 
registered resignation to the palpa- 
ble injustice of being the smallest 
of the three of them, and thus the 
one to be squeezed into the tiny 
rear compartment. 

“Getting close,” Kappelyush- 
nikov bawled in his ear. 

Dalehouse leaned forward, rub- 
bing at the glass as though the 
Jemman murk were on the inside, 
rather than all around. There was 
nothing but maroon cloud — 

Then the stark white rim of the 
Heat Pole glittered through a break. 
And something else. The clouds 
themselves were clearly bright. As 
the biplane tunneled out of the last 
of the cloud bank they were leav- 
ing, Dalehouse saw the cause before 
him. 

“Jesus Christ!” cried Kap- 
pelyushnikov. “Have they no 
shame?” 

The light was the Oily c^p. It 
stood out on the horizon like a bon- 
fire, penetrating Jem’s dour maroon 
murk with beacons, lighted win- 
dows, my God, Dalehouse mar- 
veled, even street lamps! It was no 
longer an expeditionary camp. It 
looked like a small town. 

The vertical beacon began to sweep 
across the biplane to acknowledge 
their approach — then courteously 
away, so that they were not daz- 
zled. Kappelyushnikov muttered in- 
audibly into his radio mouthpiece, 
listened for a moment and then 



began to circle. “What’s the mat- 
ter?” Dalehouse demanded. 

“Is nothing the matter, only we 
are no longer in hurry,” said the 
pilot. “Peeps will be unavoidably 
one hour detained, so let us study 
this miracle before landing on it. ” 

A miracle it very nearly was. 
There were only about forty people 
in the Greasy camp, but they 
seemed to have almost that many 
buildings. Buildings. Not tents or 
plastic huts; what had they made 
them out of? And what buildings! 
Some were barracks, some seemed 
individual bungalows. One looked 
more like a tenth-size copy of the 
Eiffel Tower than any structure one 
could live or work in. Another was 
a good twenty-five meters in length. 
And — what was that curious shal- 
low round pietaled cone on the far 
side of the camp? It seemed to be 
constructed of bent strips of shiny 
metal arrayed around a central black 
cylinder. Could it be a solar 
generator? If so, it was almost 
megawatt size! And — that stubby 
tower with the horizontally rotating 
fan. Wasn’t that the exhaust from an 
air condiiionerl 

it 

Over the rattles and groans that 
came from his Krinpit escort, 
Ahmed EHilla heard a sputtering dis- 
tant sound. “Put me down. Wait. 
Try to be quiet,” he called 
peevishly in the mixture of Urdu 
and their own language that made 
communication possible between 
them. Or sometimes did. He low- 
ered himself from the litter in which 
they had been carrying him and 
climbed onto a knee of a many-tree, 
pushing aside the pinkly glowing 



JEM 



97 




fronds to stare around the sky. A 
tiny two-winged aircraft was chut- 
tering along just below cloud level. 
“So. Another triumph of technol- 
ogy arrives,” he said. 

The Krinpit, Joim-fteet, rearer' 
back to study. him more carefully, 
its stubby claws waving. “Your 
meaning is not loud,” it rattled. 

“No matter. Let us move on.' 
Dulla was in no mood for a nice 
chat with grossly hypertrophied 
bugs, however useful they were 
being to him. “Go, carry the litter 
and my bag, I will walk,” he or- 
dered. “It is too steep here for rid- 
ing.” They were climbing from the 
shallow valley of the river now, up 
through the last of the forested 
slopes onto the dry highlands. The 
vegetation began to change from 
many-trees and ferns to things like 
succulents, stubby barrels with 
glowing bright-red luminous but- 
tons. Dulla looked at them all with 
distaste. Study the plants, find new 
products, it is in this way that my 
fathers became independent of the 
machines of the outside world. So 
Feng Hua-tse had advised before he 
left; but Dulla was an astrophysi- 
cist, not a herbal healer, and he had 
no intention of following the fool’s 
instructions. 

There was no overhang between 
him and the sky now and he could 
see the little biplane circling, far off 
toward the bright white line of the 
Heat Pole. So. The Greasies had 
their helicopter, the Fats now had a 
plane, and what did the representa- 
tive of the People’s Republic have 
to take him to his meeting? A litter, 
carried by animals that looked like 
squashed crustaceans. Dulla fumed. 
If Feng had listened to him, they 

98 



would have insisted that the three- 
party meeting be held at their own 
camp. So they would have been 
spared this humiliation of arriving 
on a plastic frame carried by crea- 
tures out of some children’s non- 
sense fable — if not the humiliation 
of exposing to the Fats and the 
Oilies the meanness of their en- 
campment. What a disaster! And all 
Feng’s fault. Or Heir-of-Mao’s; the 
expedition should have been prop- 
erly supplied and reinforced in the 
first place, but leave it to the 
Chinamen to hoard coppers to the 
ruination of the project. 

Without warning the Krinpit 
stopped and Dulla, lost in his 
thoughts, almost tripped over them. 
“What, what?” he complained. 
“Why are you standing here?” 

“A very loud thing moves quick- 
ly,” rattled Jorm-fteet. 

“I do not hear anything.” But 
now that he was awakened from his 
reverie he did see something, a 
swell of dust behind the hills. As he 
watched, a machine topped the rise, 
coming toward him. It was still a 
kilometer away, but it looked like a 
halftrack. 

“Another triumph of conspicuous 
waste,” sneered Dulla. “How dare 
they come for me, as though I 
could not make the journey by my- 
self?” The Krinpit rattled inquir- 
ingly, and he added, “Never mind. 
Put down the litter, I will carry my 
knapsack myself now. Hide your- 
selves. I do not want the Greasies to 
see you.” 

But the words conveyed no mean- 
ing to the Krinpit. A Krinpit could 
never hide from another Krinpit as 
long as they were close enough to 
hear each other. Dulla struggled to 

GALAXY 




explain: “Go back to the place be- 
hind the hill. The Fats will not hear 
you there. I will return in the space 
it took us to come up from the 
river.” He was not sure they under- 
stood that, either. The Krinpit had a 
clear sense of time, but the vo- 
cabulary of terms to mark its units 
did not map well from one lan- 
guage, based on a diurnal cycle, to 
another which had evolved on a 
planet without easy temporal refer- 
ence points. But they lurched away 
obediently and Dulla walked stead- 
ily toward the approaching 
halftrack. 

The driver was a Kuwaiti, appar- 
ently a translator, because he 
greeted Dulla in flawless Urdu. 
“Would you like a lift?” he called. 
“Jump in!” 

“You are very courteous,” 
smiled Dulla. “Indeed, it is a little 
warm for strolling today.” But it 
was not courtesy at all, he fumed 
internally, it was only more of their 
darhnable arrogance! Ahmed Dulla 
was quite sure that he was the only 
person on Jem whose native lan- 
guage was Urdu, and here the 
Greasies had made sure they had 
someone who could speak to him! 
As though he himself were not al- 
ready proficient in four other lan- 
guages! 

The time would come, he prom- 
ised himself, when he would hum- 
ble their swinish ostentation. So he 
rode up over the gullied hills toward 
the Greasy camp, chatting amiably 
with the Kuwaiti, remarking politely 
on the fine appearance of their 
camp, his face smiling and his heart 
swelling with rage. 

★ 



The official host for the meeting 
was named Chesley Pontrefact, 
London-born but not of native roots 
that went many generations back. 
His skin was purplish-brown and his 
hair white wool. Coded tachtran 
messages had given Dulla a good 
deal of background - on every 
member of the Greasy expeditions, 
as well as the Fats, and he knew 
that Pontrefact was an Air Vice 
Marshal and nominal commander of 
the Greasy expedition. But he also 
knew that real power belonged to 
one of the civilians from Saudi 
Arabia. Pontrefact bustled about the 
long conference table (wood! ship- 
ped all the way from Earth!), offer- 
ing drinks and smokes. “Brandy do 
you. Dr. Dalehouse?” he inquired 
solicitously. “And perhaps a 
Coca-Cola for you, sir?” I’m afraid 
we don’t have orange juice, but at 
least there’s ice. ” 

“Nothing, please, ” said Dulla, 
seething. Ice! “1 suggest we begin 
our meeting, if that is convenient.” 
“Certainly, Dr. Dulla.” Pon- 
trefact sat down heavily at the head 
of the table and glanced inquiringly 
around. “Mind if I take the chair. 
Just for form’s sake?” 

Dulla watched to see if anyone 
from the Fats was going to object, 
and spoke a split-second before they 
did. “Not at all. Marshal Pon- 
trefact.” he said warmly. “We are 
your guests.” But one should show 
courtesy to guests, and what was 
this seating arrangment but a delib- 
erate insult? Pontrefact at the head, 
two of his associates at the foot, the 
Kuwaiti translator and a woman 
who could be no one but the Saudi 
civilian who was the Greasies’ 
decision-maker. On one side of the 



JEM

table were all three of the Fats, 
Dalehouse, their Russian pilot and 
their own translator; and on the 
other — only himself. How much 
more deliberately could they point 
out that he was alone and insignifi- 
cant? He added diffidently, “Since 
we are all conversant, I believe, 
with English, perhaps we can dis- 
pense with the translators. It is an 
old saying of my people that the 
success of a conference is inversely 
proportional to the square of the 
number of participants.” 

Quickly, “I shall stay," said the 
Fats translator. Pontrefact raised his 
white-caterpillar eyebrows but said 
nothing; Dulla shrugged politely and 
gazed toward the chair, waiting for 
the proceedings to begin. 

The Saudi whispered to the in- 
terpreter at some length. Across the 
table, Dalehouse hesitated, then got 
up to reach across the table. “Good 
to see you looking fit, Ahmed,” he 
said. 

Dulla touched his hand mini- 
mally. “Thank you.” And, grudg- 
ingly, “And thank you for assisting 
in returning me to my own camp. I 
have not had a chance to express 
my gratitude since.” 

“Glad to help. Anyway, it’s 
good to see someone from your 
expedition — we don’t see many of 
you, you know.” 

Dulla glared. Then, stiffly, “I 
have come a long way for this 
meeting. Can we not begin?” 

“Oh, hell,” said Pontrefact from 
the head of the table. “Look, mates. 
The whole reason for this meeting 
is to try to work together better. We 
know what a balls-up our masters 
have made of Home. Shall we see 
if we can do a bit better here?” 



Dulla said happily, “Please limit 
your observations to your own 
people.” It was as he had sus- 
pected, the Greasies were going to 
insult everyone but themselves. Let 
this West Indian whose grandfather 
was a ticket-collector on the London 
Underground make a fool of him- 
self, if he chose. Not of the 
People’s Republics. 

“But I’m in dead earnest. Dr. 
Dulla. We invited you here because 
it’s clear we are all working at cross 
purposes. Your own camp is in 
serious trouble, and we all know it. 
The Food people and our own lot 
are a bit better off, yes. But you 
don’t have a proper doctor, do you. 
Dr. Dalehouse? Not to mention a 
few other things. And we can’t be 
expected — That is, we don’t have 
limitless resources eithet. Under the 
U.N. resolution we are ail supposed 
to cooperate and divide the respon- 
sibilities. Particularly the science. 
We undertook the geology, and you 
can't say we haven’t played fair 
about that. We’ve done a great 
deal . ’ ’ 

“Indeed so,” put in Kap- 
pelyushnikov blandly. “Is pure 
coincidence that most is in personal 
vicinity and relates primarily to fis- 
sionables and to salt domes.” 

“That is, to petroleum,” Dulla 
agreed. “Yes, I think we are all 
aware of tharr’Marshal Pontrefact.” 
How thoughtful of the Fats and the 
Greasies to begin quarreling among 
themselves so soon! 

“Be that as it may,” the chair- 
man went on doggedly. “There’s a 
hell of a lot to be done here and we 
can’t do it all. Astronomy, for in- 
stance. We did orbit a satellite ob- 
servatory, but as I am sure you 



100 



GALAXY 




know — it ran into malfunctions. Let 
me show you something.” He got 
up and moved to a likris screen on 
the wall. When he had fiddled with 
it for a moment the crystals sprang 
into vari-colpred light showing 
some sort of graph. “You’ve seen 
our solar generator. This shows the 
solar input for our power-plant. As 
you see, there are spikes in the 
curve. This may not seem important 
to you, but our generator is a preci- 
sion instrument. It isn’t going to do 
its job properly if the solar constant 
isn’t, well, constant.” 

Dulla stared in black envy at the 
graph. That was what he was here 
for, aftef all, because he was a 
specialist in stellar studies! He 
hardly noticed when Dalehouse put 
in, “If Kung is acting up, it may 
mean more to us than a few wiggles 
in your power supply.” 

Pontrefact nodded. “Of course it 
may. We notified this to 
Herstmonceux-Greenwich with a 
copy of the tape. They’re quite 
upset about it. Kung may be a vari- 
able star. ’ ’ 

“Hardly,” sneered Dulla. “It is 
known that a few flares are possi- 
ble. ” 

“But it is not known how many, 
or how big; and that’s exactly what 
we need to know. What, if I may 
say, we confidently expected to 
know from the astronomical re- 
searches that were meant to be 
conducted by your expedition. Dr. 
Dulla.” 

Dulla exploded, “But this is too 
much! How can one practice as- 
-trophysics when one is hungry? And 
whose fault is that?” 

“Certainly not ours, old chap,” 
Pontrefact said indignantly. 



“But someone blew up our ships, 
old chap. Someone killed thirty-four 
citizens of the People’s Republics, 
old chap!” 

“But that was — ” Pontrefact 
stopped the sentence in mid-syllable. 
He made a visible effort to control 
his temper. “Be that as it may,” he 
got out again, “the plain fact is the 
work’s got to be done and some- 
one’s got to do it. You have the in- 
struments, and we don’t, at least 
not until proper telescopes arrive 
from Earth. We have the man- 
power, and you evidently don’t.” 

“I beg your pardon. Allow me to 
inform you of my academic stand- 
ing. I am director of the Planetol- 
ogy Institute at Zulkifar Ali Bhutto 
University and have graduate de- 
grees in astrophysics from — ” 

“But no one’s disputing your de- 
grees, dear, man, only your fitness 
to function. Let us send our own as- 
tronomer over. Better still, let 
Boyne airlift your equipment here, 
where there’s better seeing — ” 
“Certainly not! Not either!” 

“I really don’t think that’s quite 
fair, do you? We’ve certainly coop- 
erated in providing food, for 
instance — ” 

“Such food! For your people, 
not for ours; all flour, hardly any 
rice. ” 

Dalehouse said placatingly, 
“We’ll turn up some rice for you, 
if that’s what you like.” 

“How gracious of you!” Dulla 
sneered. 

“Now, wait a minute, Dulla. 
We’ve done our best for you — and 
we have a couple of complaints of 
our own, if you want to know. Like 
shooting at me!” 

Dulla grimaced. “That was only 

101 



JEM 




Hua-tse’s foolishness with fire- 
works. The People’s Republics have 
already expressed their regrets.” 

“To whom? The dead bal- 
loonists?” 

“Yes,” sneered Dulla, with ex- 
aggerated hurnility, “of course, it is 
so, we do apologize to your close 
friends, the comic gasbags. And to 
' yours too, sir, the vermin that dig 
in the earth whom you find so use- 
ful!” 

“If you mean the Creeps,” said 
Pontrefact, his control of his temper 
wearing thin, “at least we don’t use 
them as litter bearers.” 

“No! You use them to help 
exploit the mineral riches! Is it not 
true that there has been radiation 
disease among them?” 

“No, it isn’t! At least, not here. 
We did use a few to dig samples for 
us in other areas, and, yes, they did 
encounter some radiation, but I 
must say that I resent the imputation 
that we are exploiting the natives.” 
“Oh, I am sure you would not do 
that. Marshal Pontrefact, especially 
as your own ancestors must have 
experienced so much of that from 
the other side, as it were.” 

“Now, look here, Dulla!” But 
Pontrefact was interrupted by the 
Saudi woman, who said: 

“1 think we should recess for 
lunch. We have much to discuss, 
and shouting at each other will not 
help. Let’s resolve to try to do bet- 
ter in the afternoon.” 

★ 

Thirty meters below the airstrip, 
Mother dr’Shee woke with the smell 
of cyanide in her splayed nose, too 
faint to be dangerous, too strong to 



ignore. The Shelled Devils were at 
it again. 

She yipped peremptorily for the 
brood-member on duty. It turned 
out to be t’Weechr, the runt of the 
litter and the one the others saddled 
with the least attractive jobs — 
including, she realized justly, at- 
tending to the wants of the Mother 
when she first woke up. There were 
only seven in this present brood of 
hers, and all of them male, and 
none of them the size, or the 
strength, or the wit of their father. 
It was a loose and unsettling time, 
and it spoiled her temper. “Food,” 
she ordered harshly. “And drink. 
And someone to groom me while I 
am waiting. ” 

t’Weechr said humbly, “There is 
no one but me. Brood Mother. I 
will be quick with the food, and 
groom you while you eat.” 

“And why is there no one?” 

“The New Devils are teaching. 
Brood Mother. All are commanded 
to be present. ” 

“Tssheee.” If dr’Shee had been 
’ a human, the sound would have 
been a grunt, written “Humph” for 
convenience’s sake. But .she was 
not actually displeased, merely fret- 
ful; and when t'Weechr returned it 
was not only with tubers, and a shell 
of water, but there were even some 
fresh leaves and fruits from Above. 
“Taken or given?” She demanded, 
sniffing them suspiciously. 

“These were gifts of the New 
Devils, Brood Mother,” the youth 
apologized. 

“Tssheee.” They were, however, 
tasty, and she was hungry. She def- 
ecated neatly into the shell when 
she was finished, and t'Weechr 
folded it closed. 



102 



GALAXY 




“Is there any other service, 
Brood Mother?” he asked, licking a 
final strand of her fur into neatness. 

“No. Be gone.” He touched 
noses and wriggled away to deliver 
the package to the rotting rooms. 
The next brood would mix it with 
the planting mud, and plaster it into 
The ceilings of the farm tunnels 
when they prepared the next crops. 
By then it would be well aged, and 
of great value in growing the tu- 
bers. Runt or not, t’Weechr was a 
good child. She would miss him 
when the litter matured and scat- 
tered. And that time was not far 
off. At every awakening now her 
dugs had been smaller and harder. 
The breeding males knew it, and 
every time she left her nest they 
wriggled close to touch her, nose- 
to-anus, testing to see how near she 
was to courtship. Only yesterday 
the male with the scarred leg had 
said, half jesting, “What would you 
like next time, dr‘Shee? Krinpit 
shell? A live Flying Devil? The 
Head of a New Devil?” 

“Your own head,” she had said, 
half irritated, half flirtatious. He 
had snorted laughter through the 
spreading folds of his nose and 
crept away, but he would be back. 
It was not an unpleasing thought. 
dr’Shee’s brood-sister had mated 
with that one, two litters ago. A 
fine brood, three females! And the 
sister had said he was indefatigable 
at rut. Well. A proper courtship was 
a proper courtship, but she could 
not help hoping that he might turn 
out to be the male with the finest 
gift to lay before her. 

Faint and distant vibrations in the 
earth set her whiskers to quivering. 
That was the New Devils, too. 



Time was when such tremors had 
meant only a particularly violent 
thunderstorm Above, or perhaps the 
crash of a falling many-tree. Now 
the New Devils scraped and shoved 
hillocks and boulders around at 
will, and the earth was no longer 
easy to her senses. As she moved 
around her chamber, sniffing and 
touching to make sure everything 
was in its place, it was touch and 
smell and taste that principally 
guided her. Sometimes her males 
had plastered bits of fungus and 
vegetation into the walls, along with 
the secretions that made their tunnel 
walls hard and water-proof, and 
from the plant decay there was 
some faint glow. dr’Shee ap- 
preciated the light, but did not need 
it. For her people eyes were almost 
a handicap, especially on their in- 
frequent dashes to the surface, when 
only the densest of cloud and worst 
of storms dimmed Kung’s radiance 
enough for them to bear. 

“Greeting, dr’Shee.” 

She sniffed in startlement, and 
then recognized the female at the 
entrance to her chamber. “How are 
you, qr’Tshew? Come in, come 
in.” 

The other female entered, and 
dr’Shee said at once, “I will send 
for food. ” 

“I have eaten,” said qrTshew 
politely. “What lovely courtship 
gifts.” She fondled dr’Tshee’s col- 
lection. Six breedings, six fine gifts: 
a hard thing stolen f^rom the New 
Devils that no one understood, the 
leg of a crabrat — that had been her 
first gift, and the least worthy, but 
in some way the most satisfying of 
her courtship gifts. Even the claws 
of a balloonist. Every one had been 



JEM 



103 




stolen from the Surface itself, at 
great risk, and delivered to her at a 
cost. Few males survived more than 
two or three mad, half-blinded 
dashes to the Surface to steal court- 
ship gifts. The enemies were ev- 
erywhere. 

Manners satisfied, qrTshew 
came to the point. “The father of 
my last brood has died of a bad 
breathing,” she said. “Also three 
young of other mothers. ” 

“What a pity,” said dr’Shee. She 
was not referring to the male, of 
course, once a male had achieved 
breeding he was done, for that 
female. But to have young die of 
the cyanide gas! 

“I fear for our way of life,” said 
qrTshew primly. “Since the New 
Devils came, our litters have not 
been the same.” 

“I have had the same thought,” 
dr’Shee admitted. “I have spoken 
of it to my sisters. ” 

“And I to mine, and I and my 
sisters have thought something we 
wish to share. Our young are being 
taught things by the New Devils. 
dr’Shee, shouldn’t we mothers learn 
what the litters are learning?” 

“But they are learning ways of 
bringing death! You and 1 are 
mothers qrTshew!” dr’Shee was 
shocked. 

“The Krinpit bring death to us, 
do they not? The broods in the 
upper galleries have blocked off the 
tunnels where the bad air came 
from, but Is it not certain that the 
Shelled Devils will break through 
again and more bad air will come?” 
“I cannot bring death, except of 
course for food.” 

“Then let us eat them, shells and 
all,” said qrTshew grimly. “Touch 



closely, dr’Shee. There is a 
story — ” She hesitated. “I do not 
know how true it is. It came from a 
Krinpit, and might as well have 
come from a Flying Devil.” That 
was an old saying to indicate dubi- 
ousness, but in this case, dr’Shee 
realized, it was actually true. “This 
Shelled Devil taunted one of my sis- 
ter’s brood by saying that New Dev- 
ils had destroyed an entire city of 
our race. He said the New Devils 
thought of us as vermin, and would 
not rest until we are all gone. That 
is why they have given the Krinpit 
the bad air.” 

“But the New Devils are teach- 
ing our litters how to destroy Krin- 
pit.” 

“The next part of the story is 
puzzling, but I think it is so. The 
Shelled Devil says that there are 
three kinds of New Devils. One 
kind destroyed the city. Another 
kind gave them the bad air with 
which they harm us here. And the 
kind that teaches our litters is a 
third kind. They have destroyed 
Flying Devils and Krinpit, as well 
as persons of the two other kinds of 
their own race. But they do not de- 
stroy us. ” 

dr’Shee thrashed her long, supple 
body in agitation. “But that is not 
true!” she cried. “They have taken 
several litters from their classes to 
some other place, and only a few 
have returned. And they have been 
weak and slow, and speak of their 
brood-mates dying!” 

“My sisters and I have heard this 
also,” agreed qr’Tshew. 

“Tsshee!” The petaled folds of 
dr’Shee ’s nose were rippling furi- 
ously. “It feels,” she said at 
length, “as though the teaching of 



104 



GALAXY 




bringing death is not a bad thing. If 
we bring death to the Krinpit, then 
they will not be able to bring more 
bad air to us. If we help our New 
Devils to bring death to the others, 
then they will not be able to aid the 
Krinpit or the Flying Devils against 
us. ” 

“1 have had this same thought, 
dr’Shee.” 

“I have a further thought, 
qrTshew. Once we have brought 
death to these others, perhaps we 
can then bring death to our own 
New Devils.” 

‘‘And then our litters will be ours 
again, dr’Shee!” 

‘‘And our burrows will be safe 
and dark. Yes! Do not go away, 
qrTshew. I will summon t’Weechr 
and he will begin to teach us these 
lessons!”

Even in Jem’s favorable condi- 
tions, air denser, gravity less than 
Earth, there was a peremptory equa- 
tion of lift. Danny Dalehouse could 
carry what he could carry, and there 
•was an end to it. To carry any of 
Dalehouse’s gifts meant sacrificing 
ballast and therefore mobility. To 
carry them all was impossible. 
When Dalehouse scolded him for 
giving the crossbow to a 
flockmate— at a time when the 
ha ’aye ’ i seemed everywhere ! — 
Charley sang placatingly, ‘‘But I 
must keep the speaker-to-air! I can- 
not have both, cannot have both.” 

‘‘And if you are killed by a 
ha ’aye 'i, what good will the radio 
do you?” But Charley didn’t even 
seem to understand the question. He 
and the flock were singing a sort of 



rhapsody about the speaker-to-air 
and how it enriched their chorus, 
and Dalehouse abandoned the ef- 
fort. Charley’s possession of the 
radio wasn’t all good. It meant that 
Dalehouse could really keep in con- 
tact with the flock from the ground, 
as long as they stayed in line of 
sight or somewhere near it, and that 
fact had not escaped Major San- 
tangelo, the new camp comman- 
dant. It was getting harder to escape 
into the air. At the same time, it 
was getting less attractive to stay in 
the camp. Santangelo had estab- 
lished command at once. He had 
proved it by sending Harriet and 
Alex Woodring off to try to make 
contact with a distant tribe of bur- 
rowers, uncontaminated, they 
hoped, by contact with the 
Greasies. And the camp was being 
run on increasingly strict military 
lines. 

Dalehouse broke through the 
flock’s song. ‘‘I must return. Four 
more flocks of our people are join- 
ing us and I wish to be there when 
they arrive.” 

‘‘We will come with you, we 
will come with you — ” 

‘‘No, you won’t,” he contra- 
dicted. “Too many ha ’aye ’i near the 
camp.” That was the truth, and 
that, too, was a consequence of the 
“gifts” he had given them. Since 
the Oilies had found out that San- 
tangelo ’s “scientific instruments” 
were being used by the balloonists 
to keep tabs on what was going on 
in their camp they had taken to 
shooting down every balloonist that 
came within a kilometer of them. 
So balloonists were growing locally 
scarce, and the predators were get- 
ting hungry. “Fly by the Wet Val- 



JEM 



105 




leys,” he commanded. ‘‘Leam if 
our people are well there.” 

“No need,” sang Charley. “See 
the wings of your friend Ha’y com- 
ing from there even now!” And 
back behind the shoreline there it 
was, Cappy’s little biplane coming 
back from visiting the outpost, cir- 
cling in for a landing. 

“Then good-bye,” sang 
Dalehouse, and expertly vented 
hydrogen until he came down to the 
level of the on-shore winds that car- 
ried him back to the camp. 

He was getting really good at bal- 
looning, and he was smiling as he 
drifted down over the comman- 
dant’s pet project, the little mud fort 
on the shore, and dropped to earth 
on the first bluff. He gathered up 
the deflated balloons, slung their 
loose netted bulk over his shoulder 
and walked happily enough up to 
the hydrogen shed. 

That was the end of happiness. 
Half the camp was gathered around 
Kappelyushnikov and Santangelo, 
farther up the hill. Jim Morrissey 
and a half dozen others were com- 
ing toward him, their faces grim. 
Dalehouse caught Morrissey’s arm 
as he passed. “What’s the matter?” 
he demanded. 

Morrissey paused. “Trouble, 
Danny. Something’s happened to 
the out-camp. Harriet, Woodring, 
Dugarchenko — they’re missing. 

Cappy says the camps ’s been ripped 
apart, and they’re gone.” 

“Harriet?” 

“All of them, damn it! And 
there’s blood and Krinpit tracks all 
over the place. Let go, we’ve got to 
get down to Castle Santangelo — in 
case they invade by sea, 1 guess. 
Anyway, you’d better get up there 



and see what your orders are.” 

Orders! How like an Army 
officer to over-react and start issu- 
ing orders in all directions! 
Dalehouse let them go past and 
walked belligerently up to the group 
around Santangelo and the pilot. 
Someone was saying, “ — 1 didn’t 
know there were any Krinpit in the 
Wet Valleys. ” 

“If you were in Beverly Hills 
you wouldn’t know there were any 
rattlesnakes in California, either, 
but if you wandered around Hol- 
lywood Hills they’d bite your ass 
off. That’s enough for arguing,” 
the major said. “Those of you with 
assigned defense posts, get to them. 
We’ve got four ships coming in in 
the next twenty hours. It’d be a 
good time for anybody to catch us 
off guard, and we’re not going to 
be caught. Move it!” 

Dalehouse, who had been given 
no assigned defense p>ost, was not 
anxious to get one. He moved away 
briskly with the others as the group 
broke up, circling around the out- 
skirts to approach the communica- 
tions shack. 

Inside, the comm team on duty 
was watching a continually shifting 
display of moving symbols against a 
green grid of coordinate lines: the 
four resupply ships, already in orbit 
around Jem, were making their final 
course corrections before dropping 
down to the surface. Dalehouse had 
expected Kappelyushnikov to show 
up there and he did, moments after 
Daleliouse himself. 

“Ah, Danny,” he said dismally, 
“you have good taste for finding 
nice place to fuck off. Wait one 
while I see if asshole traffic control- 
ler has accidentally got ships in 



106 



GALAXY 




right orbit.” He peered into the 
screen, grumbled at the crew on 
duty, then shrugged and returned to 
Dalehouse. ‘‘Is on course,” he re- 
ported. ‘‘Now question is, is course 
right? We find out. Poor Gasha!” 
‘'Are you sure she’s dead?” 

‘‘Have not seen corpus delicti, 
no. But, Danny, there was very 
much blood, two liters at least.” 
‘‘But you didn’t see the bodies.” 
‘.‘No, Danny, did not. Saw 
blood. Saw tents chopjjed up to fine 
Venetian lace, clothes all over, 
food, radio smashed, little scratchy 
bug-tracks everywhere I looked. No" 
twdies. So I yelled some, listened, 
poked into bushes. Then came 
home. So poor Gasha, not to men- 
tion poor Alexei and poor Gregor. ’ ’ 
Danny shook his head wonder- 
ingly. ‘‘The Krinpit are damn noisy 
beasts. 1 don’t see, how they could 
catch the camp by surprise, and if 
they weren’t surprised they 
should’ve been able to take care of 
themselves. Santangelo made them 
carry guns. ” 

Kappelyushnikov shrugged. 

‘‘You want to, I fly you there and 
you study scene of crime for your- 
self. Right now, excuse. First ship 
is about to come out of orbit and I 
must keep controller up to personal 
high standard of accuracy.” 

★ 



Half the personnel in the first 
ship were a combat team — a fact 
which would have come as a dis- 
tinctly unpleasant shock to 
Dalehouse at one time, but now 
seemed less so. While still in orbit, 
the Vietnamese colonel command- 



ing them had been briefed by radio; 
the squad formed up outside the 
ship as they debarked, and im- 
mediately drew weapons and trotted 
to reinforce the perimeter guards. 
The second ship was also mostly 
military, but among them was a 
face Dalehouse recognized. It took 
him a mopient to make the connec- 
tion, but then it was clear; the Bul- 
garian girl who had interceded for 
him and Marge Menninger in Sofia. 
He called to her and waved; she 
looked startled, then smiled, rather 
attractively, he thought, and called 
a greeting. That was as far as it 
went just then. By then the new 
colonel had conferred with Major 
Santangelo, and the whole camp 
was mobilized. The Vietnamese — 
his name was Tree— s:ommandeered 
Kappelyushnikov and the airplane, 
and they were gone for more than 
two hours, orbiting the camp in 
widening circles, first at high al- 
titude, then nearly brushing the tops 
of the trees. All the tents had to 
come down. By the time the third 
rocket landed the tents were up 
again, now lined up six to a row, 
four rows paralleling each other, in 
what had become a company street. 
At each comer of the encampment 
pits were dug, and out of the third 
ship came machine-guns and 

flamethrowers to go into them, 
while the few rankless non- 

specialists who had not been tapped 
for unloading, tent detail or pit dig- 
ging had been set to pounding steel 
stakes into the ground ten meters 
outside the limits of the camp. 

Among the third ship’s cargo was 

two huge reels of barbed wire, and 
by the time the last ship began its 
drop they had been strung along the 



JEM 



107 




stakes. 



★ 

For once the Jemman skies were 
almost clear as the fourth ship came 
into sight, high over the far horizon 
of the ocean-like. First there was a 
broad, bright meteoritic splash of 
light as the ablative entry shields 
soaked up the worst of the excess 
energy and spilled it away in incan- 
descent shards. Then the ship itself 
was in naked-eye vision, falling free 
for a moment. A quick blue-white 
jet flare made a course correction. 
Then the trigger parachute came free, 
pulling the three main chutes after 
it. The ship seemed to hang almost 
motionless in the ruddy air, but 
slowly, slowly it grew larger until it 
was almost overhead, two hundred 
meters up. Then the chutes were jet- 
tisoned and the ship lowered itself 
on its blinding, ear-destroying rock- 
ets to the beach. 

Dalehouse had seen, he counted, 
five of those landings now, not 
counting the one he himself had 
been in. They were all almost mi- 
raculous to watch. And they were 
all different. The ships themselves 
were different. Of the new four, 
only one was the tall, silver shape 
of his own ship. The other three 
were squat double cones, ten meters 
from rounded top to rounded bottom 
as they crouched on their landing 
struts, nearly twenty meters across 
at their widest. 

The first person out of the ship 
was Marge Menninger. 

It was not a surprise. The surpris- 
ing part was that she hadn’t come 
earlier. Dalehouse realized he had 
been half expecting her on every 

108 



ship that landed. She looked tired, 
disheveled, and harried, and ob- 
viously she had been sleeping in her 
olive-drab fatigues for all of the 
transit-time week. But she also 
looked pretty good to Dalehouse. 
The female members of the Food 
Bloc party had not been chosen for 
their sexuality. Apart from a rare 
occasional grapple with someone he 
didn’t really like very much — 
sometimes impelled by tickling one 
of the balloonists into parting with a 
few sprays of joy-juice, sometimes 
by nothing more than boredom — 
Dalehouse ’s sex life had been 
sparse, joyless and dull. Margie re- 
minded him of better times. 

Margie had also come up in the 
world since Sofia; the insignia on 
her collar tabs were no longer cap- 
tain’s bars but full colonel’s eagles, 
and as she moved aside to let the 
rest of the troops debark. Colonel 
Tree and Major Santangelo were al- 
ready beginning to report to her. 
She listened attentively, while her 
eyes were taking inventory of the 
camp, the defense perimeter and the 
progress of the debarkation. Then 
she began speaking in short, quick 
sentences. Dalehouse was not close 
enough to hear the words, but there 
was no doubt that the sentences 
were orders. Tree argued about 
something. Good-humoredly, 

Margie slipped her arm around his 
shoulder while she answered, then 
patted his bottom as he moved off, 
scowling, to do as he was told. She 
and Santangelo moved up toward 
the command center, still talking; 
and Dalehouse began to revise his 
notions of what to expect from see- 
ing Margie Menninger again. 

But as they approached where he 

GALAXY 





was standing she caught sight of 
him and threw out her arms. “Hey, 
Dan! Beautiful to see you!” She 
kissed him enthusiastically. 
“You're looking real fine, you 
know? Or as close to fine as you 
can in this light.” 

“You, too,” he said. “And con- 
gratulations.” 

"On what, being here? Oh, you 
mean the eagles. Well, they had to 
give me that to handle Guy Tree. 
Dimitrova ought to be around 
somewhere, have you seen her? 
Now if we could only get the Pak 
to come for a visit we could all 
have a nice time talking over good 
old days in the Bulgarian slam- 
mer.” 

“Colonel Menninger — ” 

“All right. Major, I'm coming. 
Stay loose. Dan. We’ve got catch- 
ing up to do. ” 

He stared after her. In the old 
Rotsy days in college, before he 
had dropped out as it became clear 
that nobody would ever need to 
fight wars any more, colonels had 
seemed quite different. It wasn’t 
Just that she was female. And pret- 
ty. And young. Colonels seemed 
to have more on their minds than 
Margie Menninger did — especially 
colonels coming into a situation 
where the panic button had been so 
-recently pressed. 

★ 

“Hello, Dr. Dalehouse,” came 
Ana Dimitrova’s voice. “Mr. Kap- 
pelyushnikov said you’d be here. 
Rappelyushnikov said you’d be. 
But I must confess I was not sure 
he was in earnest.” 

Dalehouse opened his eyes and 

JEM 



109 



sat up as Cappy and the girl stooped 
through the entrance to the shed. 
The pilot’s expression made it clear 
that, whatever he had told the girl, 
he had hoped there would be no one 
there, but he rallied and said, “Ah, 
Anyushka, you must learn to trust 
me. Here is old friend to see you, 
Danny. ’’ 

Dalehouse accepted the formal 
handshake she offered. She had a 
nice smile, he observed. In fact, if 
she had not chosen to wear her hair 
pulled severely back and avoid the 
use of makeup she could have been 
quite attractive. “I was hoping to 
get a chance to talk to you. Miss 
Dimitrova. ’’ 

“Heavens, Ana, please. Old 
cell-mates must not be formal with 
each other.” 

“But on the other hand,” said 
the pilot, “must not impose on dear 
Danny, who is no doubt hungry and 
must get to mess-hall at once or risk 
missing excellent dog-meat-and- 
slime meal.” 

“Nice try, Cappy,” Dalehouse 
acknowledged. “No, I’m not hun- 
gry. How are things on Earth, Ana? 
I’ve just been hearing some bad 
stories.” 

Her expression clouded. “If the 
stories you have heard have been 
violence and disaster, then, yes. 
that is how things are. Just before 
we left, television news spoke of 
martial law in the city of Los 
Angeles, and also in several cities 
of Europ)e. And there was some 
sinking of an Australian naval ves- 
sel off the coast of Peru.” 

“Dear God. ” 

“Oh, there is much more than 
that. Dr. Dalehouse — Dan. But we 
have brought all the recent news- 



papers, as well as tapes of televi- 
sion programs — it is really quite an 
extensive library, I understand. I be- 
lieve there are more than twenty 
thousand books in microfiche, at 
Colonel Menninger’s express or- 
ders.” 

‘ ’T wenty thousand books ? ’ ’ 

Dalehouse shook his head. “You 
know, I never thought of her as a 
reader. ’ ’ 

Ana smiled and sat eross-legged 
on the floor before him. “Please, 
let us be comfortable. I too am 
sometimes astonished at Colonel 
Menninger. ” She hesitated, then 
said, “She is not, however, always 
to be relied on. I had expected 
some time to consult with my 
government before coming here, on 
her promise. But it did not happen. 
None of us were allowed to leave 
the camp until we were flown to the 
launching point. Perhaps it was be- 
cause she did not want to risk ex- 
posing us to the unstable conditions 
we might have found.” 

“As bad as that?” 

“Worse,” growled Kap- 
pelyushnikov. “You see, Danny? 
We should be grateful to be here on 
safe tropical-paradise planet like 
Jem, where only once in a while 
isolated party gets wiped out by 
giant cockroaches.” 

“That’s another thing,” said 
Danny. “Marge Menninger doesn’t 
seem particularly worried, after the 
flap yesterday. ” 

“No reason to worry, dear 
Danny. I and little Vietnamese col- 
onel have scoured every centimeter 
from ten klicks in all directions, 
using magnetometer, I-R scanners 
and good piloting eyes. Is no metal 
thing bigger than breadbasket any- 



110 



GALAXY 




where around, I promise, and not 
more than three, maybe six, crea- 
tures larger than crab-rat. So sleep 
safely tonight, Danny. In own 
bed,” he added pointedly, and did 
not need to add “soon.” 

Nan was quicker than he. “That 
is good advice, Cappy,” she said, 
standing up. “I think I will take it 
for myself. ’ ’ 

“I will escort you,” rumbled 
Kappelyushnikov. “No, do not dis- 
turb self, Danny, I see you are quite 
tired.” 

Ana sighed. “Gospodin 
Kappelyushnikov,” she scolded, 
“apart from the fact that I am tired 
and quite disoriented from all these 
new experiences, you and 1 have 
barely met. 1 do hope that we will 
be friends. Please don’t make that 
difficult by behaving like some 
Cossack with a peasant maid.” 

Cappy looked abashed, then an- 
gry. Then he grinned. “Anyushka, 
you are fine Slavic girl. Yes, we 
will be friends at once. Later on, 
perhaps more — but,” he added hast- 
ily, “only in proper Soviet style, 
no premature touching, all right? 
Now let us all three stroll through 
pleasant Jemman murk to your 
tent. ” 

Ana laughed and slapped him on 
the shoulder. “Russian bear! Come, 
then.” She led the way outside and 
stood for a moment, glancing 
around at the quieting camp. The 
floodlights that marked official 
“day” were out, but Kung was 
clear and ruddy in the sky over- 
head. “I do not know if 1 can get 
used to a world where it is never 
night,” she complained. 

“Is severe handicap for certain 
purposes, yes,” Kappelyushikov 



agreed. They climbed the bluff and 
walked along it toward the female 
tent area. At the very edge, sur- 
rounded by a border of rounded 
stones in lieu of a lawn, was a 
larger tent then the others. It al- 
ready had a flat rock before it sten- 
ciled Col. M. Menninger, Com- 
manding . 

“Margie’s doing herself well,” 
Dalehouse commented. 

“Is privilege of rank,” said Kap- 
pelyushnikov, but he was staring 
down the beach at the four new 
ships, one tall and slim, three squat, 
resting on their landing struts. 

“That’s strange, isn’t it?” 
Dalehouse said. “Those three are 
quite unlike the others.” 

Cappy glanced at him. “You are 
truly observant, Danny.” But his 
tone was strange. 

“All right, Cappy. What’s the 
secret?” 

“Secret? Simple pilot is not told 
secrets. But I have eyes, and 1 can 
make conjectures.” 

“Come on, Cappy. You’re going 
to tell us your conjecture sooner or 
later, why not do it now?” 

“Two conjectures,” he corrected. 
“First, observe shape of three new 
spacecraft. Imagine sliced in half, 
forming two little cones each. Then 
imagine all six cones set on base 
around perimeter of camp and those 
long, narrow ports that are so un- 
necessary for navigation of space 
removed. What have we then?” 
“Upside-down cones with long 
narrow parts,” Dalehouse guessed. 

“Yes, exactly. Only when in- 
stalled on defense perimeter we 
have other name for them. We call 
them ‘machine-gun emplace- 
ments.’ ” He sighed. “I think is 



JEM 



111 




triumph of two-faced engineering 
design, not accident, that this is 
so. ” 

“But one can scarcely believe 
that,” objected Ana. “This is, after 
all, a peaceable exploration party, 
not an invac^ing army!” 

“Yes, also exactly. Is only coin- 
cidence that so many members of 
peaceable exploration party are also 
soldiers.” 

Both Dalehouse and the girl were 
silent, studying the landed space- 
ships. “I would like not to believe 
you,” said Ana at last. “But 
perhaps — ” 

“Wait a minute!” Dalehouse in- 
terrupted. “Those three ships — they 
don’t have any return stage! That’s 
why they’re so short!” 

Kappelyushnikov nodded. “And 
that is second conjecture,” he 
added heavily. “Only is not really 
conjecture. Library of twenty 
thousand books is not light reading 
for weekend. Space-craft that come 
apart to make forts are not for 
round trip. Vessels without return 
capsule capability are not accident. 
Total of sum is clear. For many of 
us, is not intended we ever go back 
to dear old planet Earth.” 

★ 

Getting into the Jemman sky 
again the next day was a victory for 
Dalehouse, and he did not know 
how many more of those victories 
he would have. The day had begun 
unpromisingly. As soon as the 
“morning” lights were on he found 
a mini-memo on the bench inside 
his tent door to let him know that, 
as from 0800 hours that standard 
day, he was to consider himself 



under military discipline with the 
assimilated rank of captain. On the 
way to breakfast he had passed an 
orderly carrying two covered trays 
into Margie’s tent. An orderly! Not 
even the late Harriet Santori had 
gone that far. And on the way back 
past the tent, the Vietnamese col- 
onel had been coming out. 

Who Marge Menninger kept in 
her bed was no concern of his, and 
all this other military Mickey- 
Mouse was irrelevant to his purpose 
on Jem. All the same, Dalehouse 
was not enjoying his flight as much 
as usual that day. 

For one thing, Charlie and his 
flock were nowhere around — partly 
because Major Santangelo had in- 
sisted they overfly some of the 
other parts of Jem to bring back in- 
telligence. Mostly because 
Dalehouse himself was reluctant to 
have them there, with so many 
ha ’aye ’i waiting in the clouds to 
prey on them. At least he had in- 
sisted they stay a full two kilome- 
ters away from the Greasy camp; 
maybe that was enough for safety. 
Meanwhile, Dalehouse had his 
lightweight carbine with him, and 
he was hoping to take out at least a 
couple of the ha ’aye ’i before Char- 
lie drifted back. TTiere was already 
one balloonist in the camp as a sort 
of combination convalescent and 
pet, waiting for his ha’aye’i-ripped 
gasbag to mend enough for flight. 
Dalehouse didn’t want Charlie to 
join him. 

Trying to look appetizing, he 
drifted under the base of a low 
cumulus-humilis. It was exactly the 
sort of place the air-sharks chose for 
hiding. But if there was one in the 
cloud it wasn’t hungry just then. 



112 



GALAXY 




He vented gas and dropped away 
from the cloud as the updraft began 
to suck him toward it; if there were 
ha ’aye ’i, he wanted to meet them in 
clear air, not where they could be 
upon him before he could shoot. A 
return flow carried him back toward 
the camp, and he looked down from 
half a kilometer on a busy scene. 
About twenty people were still un- 
loading the new ships. Others were 
clearing brush and forest to widen 
the perimeter around the camp, and 
up past the camp, toward the hills, 
in a natural meadow of thorn- 
bearing ground vines, a tiny tractor 
was plowing furrows. That was 
new! The tractor must have come 
out of one of the ships, and the fur- 
rows looked exactly as though 
someone was planning to farm. 

That was reasonable enough, and 
even good news — certainly they 
could use fresh vegetables, and if 
the Greasies could grow them so 
could the Fats. But something about 
it troubled Dalehouse. He couldn’t 
put his finger on it; something about 
using soldiers to farm? Forced labor 
on land? 

He dismissed the thought; he was 
getting too low. 

He vented some ballast, and the 
water sluiced down on the newly 
plowed land like a toy-scaled rain 
shower. The thing that was tickling 
his memory was beginning to be 
annoying. For some reason, it re- 
minded him of his undergraduate 
anthropology professor, a gentle and 
undemanding man a lot like Alex 
Woodring — 

Like Alex Woodring, who was 
dead. Along with Gasha and the 
Bulgarian corporal he had never re- 
ally come to know. 



He was having nothing but depress- 
ing thoughts. His reserves of hy- 
drogen and ballast were getting a lit- 
tle low, and evidently the ha’aye’i 
had learned to distinguish between a 
balloonist and a human being 
swinging from a netted cluster of bags . 
They were not tricked this day. Re- 
luctantly he swung back over the 
beach, vented gas and dropped to 
the pebbly sand. 

By the time he had picked up and 
stowed the deflated balloons, Mar- 
gie Menninger was approaching, 
along with the woman sergeant who 
was her orderly. “Nice flying, 
Danny,” she said. “Looks like fun. 
Will you take me up with you 
sometime?” 

He stood regarding her for a 
moment. She really looked very 
pretty, even in the maroon Kung- 
light that darkened her lips and hid 
the gold of her hair. Her fatigues 
were new and sharply pressed and 
her short hair-do flopped becom- 
ingly as she moved. “Any time you 
say. Marge. Or is it ‘colonel’?” 

She laughed. “All you brand-new 
officers are the same, very rank 
conscious. We’re off duty right 
now, Danny, so it’s Marge. You’ll 
learn.” 

“I’m not sure I want to leant 
how to be a soldier.” 

“Oh, you’ll catch on,” she 
promised. “Tinka, take the point. 
Let’s go for a walk, shall we?” 

The sergeant moved out ahead of 
them, trotting to the barbed-wire 
enclosure. The troops in the pit at 
the comer lifted a section of the 
wire aside so the three of them 
could pass through; the sergeant in 
charge gave Margie a soft salute 
and she nodded pleasantly back. “If 



JEM 



113 




a person went swimming in this wa- 
ter,” she said, “would she find 
herself being eaten up by some- 
thing?” 

“Not so far. We do it all the 
time.” 

“Lxioks pretty tempting. Care to 
join me.?” 

Dalehouse shook his head, not in 
negation but in wonder. “Margie, 
you’re something. I thought col- 
onels had to keep busy, esp>ecially 
when they think their troops need 
armed guards and barbed-wire 
fences day and night.” 

“Dear Danny,” she said good- 
naturedly, “I haven’t been a colonel 
very long, but 1 taught the Theory 
of it to a couple thousand plebes at 
the Point. 1 think 1 have a pretty 
good grasp of the basic principles. 
A colonel doesn’t have to do much, 
she just has to see that everybody 
else gets everything done. 1 already 
put in four hours of pretty solid 
work this morning.” 

“Yes, 1 saw Colonel Tree com- 
ing out of your tent.” 

She looked at him thoughtfully. 
She didn’t comment, but went on, 
“As to your other point, the 
perimeter watch is s.o.p. from now 
on, but there are patrols in the 
woods, and aerial reconnaissance 
every hour, and besides, Tinka’s a 
qualified expert with all hand 
weapons. I think you’ll be all 
right.” 

“1 wasn’t worried about my per- 
sonal safety.” 

“No, you weren’t. You were 
worried about the troops under my 
command, and on their behalf I 
thank you for your concern.” She 
grinned and patted his arm. “Hold 
on a minute.” She fished a 



cigarette case out of her pocket, 
ducked behind him to get out of the 
wind and expertly lit up. She in- 
haled deeply and held it, passing 
him the joint. When she exhaled, 
she called to the sergeant, “Tinka!” 

“Yes’m. ” 

“Next batch of dope you clean 
for us, save the seeds. Let’s see if 
we can grow the little buggers 
here.” 

“Yes’m. ” 

Danny took a long hit, beginning 
to relax. Being with Margie Men- 
ninger was never dull, at least. As he 
slowly exhaled he looked over in 
some admiration. She had adjusted 
at once to the heat; the disconcert- 
ingly low gravity, the thick air that 
had troubled theiri all for weeks. 
She was some kind of woman. 

By the time they had finished 
passing the joint back and forth, 
they were out of sight of the 
perimeter guard, where the beach 
widened under a high, bare bluff. 
Margie stopped, looking around. 
“Seems as good as any,” she 
commented. “Tinka, take your posi- 
tion. ” 

“Yes’m.” The sergeant scram- 
bled agilely up the side of the bluff 
to the top and Margie shucked her 
fatigues. She wore nothing under- 
neath. “If you’re coming, come. If 
not, stay and help Tinka keep 
watch.” And she splashed into the 
water. 

Dope, company or whatever, 
Dalehouse was feeling better than 
he had all day. He laughed out 
loud, then skinned out of his own 
clothes and joined her.

And Having Writ by Donald R. Benson. Bobbs-Merrill, $8.95. 

Don Benson has been an editor for a long time. In spite of that he writes 
well, and shows a kindhearted soul in this altemate-Earth novel. 

An alien explorer spaceship, the Wanderer, enters Earth’s atmosphere 
too fast and seems certain to explode. As a last resort, one of the human- 
like crew activates a Probability Displacer and the ship enters an alternate 
time-stream in which the ship enters the atmosphere safely, though crip- 
pled. 

They enter an Earth time-frame of the early 1900’s and are faced with 
the problem of either stimulating this Earth’s- science enough to make pos- 
sible complicated repairs to their spacer, or of being marooned. 

Benson has fun with their encounters with Teddy Roosevelt, William 
Howard Taft, Thomas Edison, the Kaiser, the Czar. This Earth’s al- 
ternate history becomes skewed in unexpected ways by the aliens’ “inter- 
ference” and good-intentions.

GALAXY 



This is a pleasant book, a mild sf adventure, written with good humor 
and competence. 

Heat by Arthur Herzog Signet, $1.95 

I didn’t think much of his previous novel. The Swarm, but in this one 
Herzog caught me and held me — sometimes against my will. He had sense 
enough to keep the personal problems and the man-woman romance in the 
background. The overpowering interest is in the gathering but uncertain 
evidence that excess CO 2 in the atmosphere is no longer being absorbed by 
the oceans. In fact, in the tropical Atlantic the ocean is giving it back. 

First the weather goes crazy. Then the heat. 

There is a terrible danger that a runaway greenhouse effect will be 
started and that Earth may end up like Venus. Humanity is on the verge of 
doom. 

The novel spends almost all its time in the build-up. The actual 
consequences — heat — and saving mankind from the oven are raced through 
in the final twenty pages. 

I suspect the book was structured and aimed for the movies. That’s good 
commercial sense, but it warps the novel. 

Dawn Of The Dead by George Romers and Susanna Sparrow, St. Martin’s, 

$7.95. 

You have to be terminally credulous to get past the ‘living dead’ premise 
of this horror novel. But if you can lock up your disbelief for a few hours, 
this novelization of a forthcoming major horror film (sequel to Night Of The 
Living Dead ... a so-called classic) will keep yoii turning pages avidly. 

On the other hand, if the concept of the recent dead coming “alive” to 
attack and eat the living and their own warm dead for food, and the ruth- 
less killing by the living of these zombies is a turn-off, don’t go near this 
book — or the movie. 

If the book is an accurate reflection of the film, the movie will be the 
bloodiest, most sickening ever made. 

These zombies are permanently killed by shooting them in the brain, or 
otherwise disconnecting the brain from the body . decapitation, smash- 
ing. ... 

No credible explanation is given for the sudden reanimation of hundreds, 
then thousands, then millions of the newly dead. They can take any kind 
of damage to the body and still keep coming (or try to come). Yet they 
make sounds — a moaning cry, and they breath and bleed, which means 
their hearts must beat to keep the brain going. ... So why wouldn’t a 
stopped heart kill them? Why wouldn’t they bleed to death? 

No explanation. This is run-run-shoot-shoot-run-fear-scream- 
Arrnrggggh! with no rationality. The three men and women we follow 
through this book are almost all given to stupidity and panic so that the 
authors can menace them again and again with the zombies. 

The novel sucks. But in its way it is exciting and gripping.

Star Rigger's Way by Jeffrey A. Carver Dell, $1.75 

The wonder of this book — a novel of character-change, maturation, 
abandonment of illusions and discovering-of-self — is the hyper-space drive 
that is called the Net and which is powered somehow by spaceship 
generators. In order to travel in the Flux — the hyperspace continuum — the 
ship’s pilots, called Riggers, must control the net with their minds — 
working as a team — and guide the ship through the dangers of hyperspace. 

The problem is that their minds impose (necessarily) an understandable 
vision of what is going on around them. They can appear to be sailing 
through an ocean ... a snowstorm ... a dangerous cavern ... a seething, 
vari-colored mist. ... a serene forest ... a deadly, rocky labyrinth 
.... and they can be wrong. 

Riggers are dijferent people, blessed and cursed with a peculiar psi talent 
that permits them to pilot ships in this manner. It is dangerous, exciting 
work. 

The novel begins when Gev Carlyle, a young Rigger, finds himself 
alone on a space ffighter, accidentally alive after an unexplained disaster in 
the Flux killed the three other Riggers who were flying the ship at the 
time. 

He has almost no chance of making it to safety, since he hasn’t the 
mind-power to pilot the huge ship. 

Then he picks up a distress beacon and is able to rescue an alien catlike 
creature — a Cephean — who is able to help fly the ship but who is self- 
destructive, a victim of his cultural conditioning. 

Yet Gev manages to link minds with the being and attempt to fly the 
deadly Flume — the only way to safety. 

Gev is haunted by his desire to reunite with three companions/Riggers 
whom he loved. The book is his fight to trace them and bring them to- 
gether again — to recreate his “family.” 

As he pursues his goal he becomes a different person, grows, matures 
. and doesn’t realize it until a final crisis forces. ... 

I had trouble with the “subjective sea” of the Flux and the ability of the 
mind to fly huge spaceships in this psi-powered hyperspace. But what^ 
thehell, it’s an engaging science fantasy and the novel will leave you say- 
ing to yourself, “Yeah!” 

Trample Down An Empire by Mack Reynolds Leisure Books, $1.50 

Three men, bored, living off Guaranteed Annual Income, as a joke and 
as a way to get some extra money, start the Subversive Party ... a mock- 
ery of the existing Republican-Democrat Party which controls the country. 

To their delight and astonishment the movettient takes hold in an equdly 
bored, quietly desperate U.S.A. and soon mushrooms to the point that their 
outrageous party principles — make everything legal (except real crime), re- 
ally clean up the air, the food, the water, maximize freedom while also 
abolishing the constitution, elections, etc. A truly revolutionary program. 
The core of the party’s appeal is selfishness . legitimized selfishness.

To this end they require payments for joining, require recruitment of two 
others, then five others for privileged status in the party. They get 
kick-backs and high profit from party uniforms, badges, etc. 

The International Bureau of Investigation, of course, plants spies and 
agents in the party, but somehow things don’t work out right for the 
Establishment-in-power. Drastic measures are called for. 

This is a humorously cynical look at American politics and contempo- 
rary American society. Some of the ideas advocated by the characters are 
Not Nice. They Disturb. They (even in mockery) make one squirm. 

The book doesn’t really end; it stops. But even so, it makes me wonder 
if the unconventional content of this novel led to its rejection by Mack’s 
regular publishers, Ace and Bantam . and other major publishers. All 
the major publishers today are owned by companies which are owned by 
companies which are owned by the biggest of the big corporations.

WHEN THE METAL EATERS CAME 



David Bunch 



They could live forever in their 
bionic metal bodies ... if anyone 
can really iive forever! 



Sure, we didn’t have to run 
from hearses then or speculate on 
coffins. See a flesh kid dragging his 
playmate through the streets and 
pounding him down with a bat, we 
didn’t care. So who’s to die and 
what’s to go? Not us, we thought. 
Let all flesh-land fall on stones and 
cut its noses on razors — good rid- 
dance! We’d just pump up and 
down on our all-weather new-metal 
knee joints, push the phfluggee- 
phflaggee button on our talkers at 
them each and everyone and laugh 
and laugh. And anytime we wanted 
to, we could pull back over the line 
into Our Country, sit in our hip- 
snuggie chairs in a Stronghold and 
gloat upion our buttons, Good- 
Gadget buttons. 

And then it happened. Just when 
you think you’ve got it made, all 
nailed up and zippered down, the 
thing starts pulling loose at the 



hinge-joints. Take us, for instance. 
We’d fought to a fine standstill and 
a victory conclusion, we thought, 
the dread human idea that, soon or 
late, all humans had to die. I think 
our bold defiance of this concept 
and our attempted solution of the 
problem should rank with some of 
science’s better things. Or at least I 
thought that before. But now — ! 

Well, what are you going to do 
when everything goes black, when 
the bright dream fades and the dark 
cover pulls over your guide stars? 
Try again? Sure! That’s the human 
way. Be sorry you laughed when 
the flesh kid died in the streets? Be 
appalled that you just yawned when 
the big fat milk horse at the noon- 
day curb was half halved by that 
runaway factory wagon? Well, 
perhaps be sorry. But not too much 
time to be sorry over the mishaps of 
flesh-land. What’s to gain by being 



120 



GALAXY 




sorry? 

And speaking of mishaps — If 
you have not by this time seen 
someone half eaten by our new- 
metal all-metal metal eaters, you 
have missed one of the world’s 
stark horrors. You cannot say, “I 
have seen deep tragedy.” You have 
seen nothing! By comparison all 
other mishaps must seem but soft 
landings and easy fractures. Or at 
least it seems so to me. But then, I 
might be prejudging in favor of my 
own condition. You be the judge. 

You see, we had it made in 
steel-topped Moderan, the country 
of the peotals, where metal-and- 
people people lounged in Strong- 
hold homes with their Good-Gadget 
buttons. There is to that no reason- 
able doubt to have — we had it 
made. We’d had ourselves done 
over. Long ago. After that, standing 
around in a truce time in our new- 
metal alloy “replacements,” our 
bulk like new-metal armor, our 
flesh-strips few and played-down, 
couldn’t we spit at time then, 
couldn’t we laugh it down? Our or- 
gans made up of tireless gadgetry, 
hearts like little engines, lungs like 
accordion boxes, flexi-flex new- 
metal bellows — couldn’t we max 
out of a dormant whenever we 
chose for a spree, couldn’t we push 
buttons and flick switches on a 
big-daddy go!? And food — that in- 
troven! purer than fresh mountain 
snow and GOOD! great for a flesh- 
strip feed. Oh things were fine in- 
deed then, and no hurry in steel- 
topped Moderan where the plastic 
yard sheets covered our sterilized 
acres. Germless as new mountain 
snowballs in Old Times we had 
eternity! all sacked and tied and 



slung upon our backs like golden 
apples in a bag. 

And then they came, low like 
damp dark smoke over the metal 
flowers, dropping in out of nowhere 
one spring day. Others were riding 
the air high up like eagles floating 
in Old Times. A million of them 
perhaps would, lumped, make a 
speck as big as a small-small pencil 
dot. Under our powerful lenses they 
had jaws and teeth like ocean sharks 
of Old Days. Just say they were the 
dread metal fly-fleas, strangest mu- 
tants of all time. So what’s to tell? 
Just tell that they ate us? Oh, how 
portray the horror? 

One moment, say, you’re sitting 
outside the eleventh, outermost 
Wall of your Stronghold. It’s be- 
tween wars, a fine June Tuesday, 
and your Warner hangs dormant 
while the cone balls that are your 
ears for danger go silent round- 
and-round in a slow circling above 
your armor in this pleasant time of 
truce. And then the cloud flings up, 
small, far out, where the flower 
tops meet the vapor shield, grows 
and keeps on coming. And it hits. 
In an incredibly short time, under 
your Warner’s heavy and helpless 
danger clangor, it lands with a 
small-small sound like the buzz a 
very fine sleet might make tack- 
tacking against a window. In An- 
cient Weather. You feel nothing, 
being mostly that hitherto all- 
protective invincible survival metal, 
but you see the deep black film set- 
tle, shift, go up and down and 
across you. You try to wipe it off. 
Ha. There is no method. You try to 
think of things. You try to pretend 
that nothing is happening. You sit 
and sing. You speculate on a Max 



121 




Fire to blast his threat when it’s 
winging. Ho! Did you ever try to 
fell a cloud — or bring down 

smoke — with rifle fire? —After 
a while the deep black film lifts with 
a tiny sound, like small-small sand 
falling across -a rock. There is a 
darkness in the air for a fleeting in- 
stant. You watch the darkness go. 
You try to sing. You try to pretend 
nothing has happened. But some- 
thing has happened! You’re smaller 
by a little than you had been. For 
you have just had your visit from 
the new-metal all-metal metal eat- 
ers, deadliest mutants ever known. 

And all over Moderan it goes on, 
this thing. The dark droning clouds 
rage up countless times in the morn- 
ing, countless times in the af- 
ternoon, sweep in upon us and chop 
out a metal fill. Or if it’s a time of 
war, and we’re inside tending to 
launcher buttons, the clouds film 
across our Strongholds and eat there 
on the roof. We or our Strongholds, 
it is the same, in time it is the 
same. Inexorably they will eat all. 

And so we who once had forever. 
Eternity, like a bright wish tied 
down, feel the great thing go little 
by little in a black film drifting over 
us from time to time. And when the 
wings fan up of the shaik-jawed 
atoms, loaded and going away, and 
we fling a pocko-scope viewer up to 
our wide-range mechanized eyes for 
a better peep at our tormentors, and 
see them so magnified, sometimes 
we think of a black drift of condors 
all plated with terrible scales. It is 
then that we know, and we see how 
we stand. They go away on a Joy- 
flight digesting a little of us on the 
wind each day, each day. And so 
we are mortal after all, to a degree 

122 







as vulnerable as any in simple 
flesh-land? Is it only a question of 
time? 

But the dieam! The magnificent 
dream lives on and feeds upon 
eternity — or the quest for that. It 
clothes its bones in hope again and 
comes out fighting. Perhaps it is 
only a minor setback after all, this 
of the metal “fleas.” Perhaps to- 
morrow, some shiny-new tomorrow, 
we shall “replace” ourselves with 
the pure dream — a thing like rub- 
ber, maybe. Yes! a new-cell rubber 
alloy, that could be the answer. 
And the metal metal eaters will 
starve then, their vile steel bellies 
sucked jip in terrible tiny ribs and 
mouths chopping hard in a foodless 
hopeless time. They will drift out to 
die, as all things shall and must that 
have annoyed king Man. YES!

LETTERS 




First, could I please comment on 
C. J. Cherryh’s “The Faded Sun: 
Kesrith”? I thought it was a beautiful 
story, and sad enough in the 
genocide of the mri to make me wish 
for that miraculous happy ending that 
never came. I liked the description of 
the scenery, which helped me to feel 
there in the action; and the percep- 
tive study of Niun’s mind moved me 
very much because I can see 
threads of the same ambivalence in 
some of my own contradictory moti- 
vations and actions. 

The thing that makes me feel a lit- 
tle skeptical is that I couldn’t find a 
bridge that would make the already- 
hateful regul suddenly commit mur- 
der when it was so unlike them that 
they had to hire the mri to be mer- 
cenaries. I can understand where bai 
Hulagh could have gotten desperate, 
to where he could have broken 
through some of the conditioning 
(though it would have been lots hard- 
er than it was made out to be). But 
even so, it didn’t sit too well with me. 

I will agree that they were impossible 
to sympathize with; and in their 
forthcoming defeat, I felt a sadistic 
surge of triumph as in “Now I’ve got 
you, you s.o.b.!" A beautiful and 
hauntingly question-filled open-ended 
ending. Thank you, Ms. Cherryh. 

This letter is also a great chance 



for me to praise Galaxy for your en- 
lightened attitude toward the blind 
SF freak. Could you please send me 
the names and addresses of people 
in my area with whom I can get in 
touch? Let me explain that I am a 
blind person, and wish that along 
with Galaxy, I could also get Analog 
and Fantasy and Science Fiction. 

One big frustration is that the Li- 
brary of Congress selectors must go 
to hiding-places to find some of the 
books that do get transcribed. There 
have been all too many times I’ve 
wanted to discuss a book with a 
sighted person, only to be told, “I 
didn’t know that book was around." 
It’s an interesting thing to think 
about, because perhaps in our own 
ways, we all wish we had more time, 
chance and whatever-else to read 
more than we can. So maybe there 
isn’t all that much difference in our 
situations except for its being a 
matter of degree. I want to thank 
you. Galaxy, for helping to bridge the 
gap. 

Two books I’d like to talk about 
briefly, as examples of ones I’ve 
read and others haven’t, are Jac- 
queline Lichtenberg’s first novel, and 
a book I’m just as glad that not many 
of you have had to suffer through. 
Have some others read these, and 
could I have some feedback? 

John Guenther’s novel. The God 
Machine, was so bad I made myself 
read through the whole thing long 
after I knew it couldn’t get any better. 
It was a shame, because some of 
his ideas about the Micronizer were 
interesting and seemed original to 
me, and to some extent, I really en- 
joyed the banter and humor among 
the characters. But in general, it was 
really strange for a lot of reasons. If 



123 



he can publish and even get his 
book done in an alternative reading 
medium, there may be hopes for my 
future as a writer, despite my mis- 
givings about whether I know 
enough. 

Basically, it’s a story about what 
happens in the relatively-near future 
when a Stereotypical-Sixties-type 
movement called the Amorphous 
goes underground to try to fight and 
break the influence of a totalitarian, 
inhumane government. The main 
protagonists in the novel are Profes- 
sor Welch (there never was a first 
name for him — just Welch), and his 
wife Eve (who was never called Mrs. 
Welch). One of the ground rules for 
entering an Amorphous to pool your 
talents with other dissidents is to 
have been a victim of the System. 
Well, he is one, and a lot goes on, 
with pages used to describe how the 
explosion blew people apart in dif- 
ferent ways. Some of the names in 
the book were so obviously cutesy 
that it was hilarious; example, De- 
Corum, an ex-student of Welch’s 
who worked for the government and 
got his long feared what-for as a re- 
sult. Of the two societies, there was 
more potential for love and real 
warmth among those in the Amorph- 
ous; but generally, if that’s what so- 
ciety is evolving toward, I want to do 
all I can to change it from happen- 
ing. What did it reflect, the sickness 
of society or that of the writer? It was 
a sad mis-application of a good tal- 
ent, and let’s hope he does better 
next time — if there is a next time. 

Jacqueline Uchtenberg’s novel. 
House of Zeor, is a novel of another 
kind. The descriptions were beautiful, 
and the situation, though potentially 
disastrous, had plenty of room for 



hope. There was a lot of adaptability 
and heroism in the characters that 
left me feeling proud that I’m a 
human being, and what made it so 
stirring is that this sort of thing could 
happen. It was not written in a too- 
goixj-to-be-true way, either; you 
couldn’t help chuckling over different 
arguments caused by different cul- 
tural values. It is set in a post- 
nuclear-holocaust future where hu- 
manity, though mutation, splits into 
two unstable but evolving factions. 
Simes and Gens have to live to- 
gether; but Simes, who have special 
powers and vulnerabilities, must also 
prey upon Gens for survival, as that 
is the only source of selyn energy, 
which they will die without. It is a 
very sensitive book. Read and enjoy. 

This leads to my last question. I 
wonder if there could be an article in 
Galaxy sometime for beginning SF 
writers, with some tips on how to 
write but mostly about how the be- 
giner may get started in vying for 
publication. Along with it, could you 
give us your policies as they pertain 
to an aspiring writer? (That’s what 
caught my attention; you are using 
new writers and giving them a 
chance to express themselves 
through your pages. That’s more en- 
couraging to people like me.)

YOU WAN SOMETHEEN more?” the waitress asked. 

Dave Connell looked up from his empty glass. He brushed a few crumbs 
from the tabletop, looked at his watch, and then at the door. Someone was 
entering, but it was only another party of tourists. The dark-haired hostess 
greeted them and led them to a candlelit table in another comer of la 
trapaza turista. Nine-eighteen p.m., and no Bonnie. He sighed, and 
slumped back in his chair. ‘‘Mas cerveza,” he said, and pushed his glass 
to the edge of the table. 

‘‘Ahnd thee esenorita?” 

‘‘What?” 

‘‘Thee ladee, senor. Perhaps she would like sometheen more?” the wait- 
ress said. ‘‘Perhaps jew both would wish to hahve sometheen to eat?” 

Dave blinked. Distractedly, he imagined that she sounded suspicious, as 
though she knew that their presence here was not mere tourism. 
‘‘To . ah . eat?” he temporized. 

Oh, he was being ridiculous. This was a restaurant, and they were prob- 
ably taking up valuable time and room with their waiting and fiddling. But 
to eat? When his stomach was in knots, and the succession of beers he had 
drunk to kill the intolerable waiting time was making him even more jit- 
tery. ‘‘Well . .’’He glanced aside at Sara, holding a half-drunk brandy 
and soda. He had hardly spoken to her since the first one. Her expression 
was pleading; it was the one she wore rather than speak out and ask him 
for something, and he knew she was probably hungry. ‘‘Yes . yes. 1 
think we would like to eat, uh, por favor. Can we see a menu?” 

Of course Sara was hungry. They had been waiting here in this too- 
warm room for over two hours. And they had not eaten since breakfast in 
that airport clip-joint in Los Angeles early this morning, unless you 
counted a ham and cheese on rye, wolfed down in flight somewhere over 
the top end of Louisiana, with the jungly miles of the Deep South unroll- 
ing with hypnotic sameness beneath them as they flew steadily toward 
Miami. 

Where was the damn woman anyway? What was taking her so long? 
Something had gone wrong — he knew it had. 

The latin waitress, a tiny girl with huge, luminous eyes, and a frothy 
emulsion of lace ruffles at the bosom, smiled falsely and brilliantly at them 
before taking Dave’s empty glass and turning briskly on a spiked heel to 
bring them menus. 

Her too-short skirt reminded Dave that he was in a foreign country, 
where styles lagged ten years behind American hip, recalling unavoidably 
the Sara he had met and almost instantly loved when every trim behind in 
the country had been clad in them. Sara’s had been skirted in the in-est of 
black vinyl, topped with a muslin peon shirt that this little waitress 
wouldn’t ^ caught dead in even now. Sara had worn high vinyl boots with 
her outfit, no lipstick, and heavy earrings like stained glass in her ears, the 
only color about her, barring the green glow of her eyes under the swing of 
ironed hair and rumpled bangs. But you had to count her eyes, the eyes of

a shakti of Kama, full of pure and primordial energy. Those eyes had cap- 
tured him from across the El Monte Legion Stadium, strobes going, band 
wailing, and kept him on his feet as he struggled to get to her in sections, 
stoned into near-oblivion, but brought back by the sudden reality of a 
green-eyed she -god on the other side of a crowd of dancing freaks. Look- 
ing across the beer-ringed foreign table at her now, he could believe that 
this was a different woman. 

She met his eyes, no green fire in hers now, which were still, eternally, 
entreating after these hours of tension. “Worried?” she asked, her voice 
high-pitched with her own worry that she wouldn’t claim, but only lay on 
him. 

Dave made an impatient gesture. “Of course I’m worried. The goddam 
woman has been gone over two hours, and I’ve sat here and drunk ... I 
forgot how many beers . trying to believe she hasn’t been killed or 
mugged. Or arrested. Or skipped out, though why she’d do that when she 
can get rid of the stuff in five minutes flat in Miami, she said. I’ll be 
goddamned if I know. Or she could have been hit by a car and be lying in 
some hospital somewhere. Or in a morgue ...” 

“Dave ...” 

“Dave, don’t worry!” he growled. “Ah, don’t be ridiculous, Sara. Of 
course I’m worried.” At her stricken look, he felt immediately guilty. He 
put out a hand to cover her pale fingers. He touched her wedding ring, 
worn long enough to be largely smooth now, though when he had put it on 
her finger it had been carved with tiny lotuses. He had got it for her from 
Sikkim. Put it on her finger when they had lived together long enough to 
get used to the idea. His goddess, with whom he had shared the mysteries 
of the universe. His wife, with whom he had made a child, destined to be 
something cosmic, and now just ashes in an urn. 

Would it all have been different if Danny had lived? Would this made- 
up, anxious-eyed woman have stayed his Sara if the boy had made it? Did 
anything make any damn difference? It had made no difference to her, be- 
lieving that the drugs they had taken together had killed Danny. 

He sighed. “Honey, I’m sorry,” he told her, struggling for just the right 
amount of contrition to wipe the wounded look off her face. “I’m 
just . uptight.” He forced his face to smile. “Do you want to dance?” 
he asked, waving a hand toward the tiny dance floor where the turistas and 
their wives were waving their tails in grotesque imitations of a samba. 

Sara grimaced and pulled back her cold hand. “No. I just don’t feel like 
it.” 

He shrugged. “Suit yourself. ” 

“If I’d suited myself, we wouldn’t be here,” she said. She fumbled for 
her purse and took out a cigarette, leaning forward for him to light it. 

Anger flared in him. He said tightly, “I suppose it was all my idea. I 
wanted a second car. I decided we could afford a Visa card. I made the 
arrangements for a professional landscape artist to come and dig up tte 
back yard. I — ”

GALAXY 




“Well, you did,” she told him accusingly, lighting her own cigarette 
with the tabletop candle. “I didn’t say anything, I thought you wanted it. 
And I wanted you to be happy, to have something you liked to make up 
for — .” She bit off her words as though she hadn’t already said them often 
enough to brand them into his brain. 

Dave flung himself away from the table. “Oh, for the love of god, will 
you stop it? Whatever you thought, get it through your head that nothing, 
but nothing’s going to make up to me for Danny. No toys, nor gimmicks, 
nor greenhouse posies. Nothing!” 

“I know that. And nothing’s going to take away the guilt you — ” 

Dave brought his fist down on the table with a slam that rattled the 
candleholder against the salt and pepper. The other diners looked around 
curiously, and they heard someone three tables away say to his companion, 
“ — jjeople who don’t know how to act in public. And Americans, too — ” 

Sara jumped, dropping her cigarette. Her eyes were weary and her voice 
typically patient as she said, “Dave, you’re making a scene. People are 
looking at us. Calm down, won’t you? And let’s drop the subject. You 
never will admit — ” 

“No, I won’t,” Dave raged in a whisper, leaning across the table. 
“And neither will you. I won’t go into this here. It’s old business, prehis- 
toric. What’s right here and now is that we’re here, and we’re doing what 
we’re doing. And in awhile, I hope, Bonnie will be back with her stuff 
and we can get the hell out of this tourist heaven and go back to Glendale 
where we can sit in our paid-for house and look at our landscaping, and 
then maybe go out for a drink we don’t have to count nickels for. So let’s 
just don’t argue about it. Or about anything. Let’s get something to eat.” 
He caught sight of the little waitress stilting toward them on high heels. 
“Maybe I’m a little too drunk to make sense anyway,” he conceded, 
grudgingly. 

Sara sniffed. She wiped her eyes with the cocktail napkin. “You are too 
drunk. You’ve had seven beers while we’ve been waiting for that woman. 
And you’ve hardly said a word to me all the time we’ve been here. I wish 
I’d stayed home. ” 

“My god, so do I,” he muttered, but she had taken out her makeup and 
was repairing her face, and didn’t hear him. 

The waitress approached, laid menus before them, set Dave’s beer on 
the table. He took a swallow and picked up the menu, seeing Sara lift 
hers, open it, and put a finger to her lower lip as he had known she would 
do. It had been part of her charm^ — the grand decision of what to eat when 
the hungries had driven them out of their bare-cupboarded cubicle into the 
rush and siren-scream of the midnight city, searching for munchies. But 
this Sara didn’t lift green eyes full of excitement and lean close, whisper- 
ing, “There’s nothing fit to eat in here. Let’s get a package of baloney and 
go home and go back to bed. ’ ’ 

This one said, “I guess I’m not very hungry,” and closed the menu 
with a long-suffering sigh. “Whatever you decide is alright with me.”

Yeah. And he would order some damn thing, and she would peck at it 
like a pullet, look at him with those damning eyes and tell him, better than 
words ever could, how he had failed her, failed at everything. And that 
this was a failure too. 

He took another gulp of his beer. When would Bonnie get back with her 
merchandise so they could get out of here? When would she show up, car- 
rying the Argentinian emerids that Dave had agreed to help her smuggle 
into the States? When would she come, so they could make their connec- 
tion in Miami and Dave collect his price — everybody had one — so he could 
go back to his bungalow in Glendale and pay off every-damn-body and — 

And what? 

He didn’t know. 

Have fun? Buy things? Go places? What do you do when the lights go 
out? 

Rape the world? 

Sara eased the too-tight band of her bra under the tailored jacket, pushed 
back the curl of her hair and tucked it behind her ear. He saw her lips 
tremble, set, and he could predict she was going to say, “Dave, I under- 
stand that you’re worried, and I’m sorry I upset you.’’ 

He glanced meaningfully at the waitress. “Just forget it,” he said. He 
wished to god that she would, if only for a moment, be his Sara, the old 
Sara, able to Join him in this venture like she’d done in the old days. Able 
to do it spontaneously, without all this heavy significance. But everything 
was the same now — full of crunching, grinding, pointless responsibility 
and meaning. 

He picked a dish from the menu at random, ordered two, and the wait- 
ress left. 

As she went, a disturbance at the door again caught his attention. A loud 
anglo in a shirt to match was calling the hostess “moo-cha-cha” and com- 
plimenting her on the weather like she’d ordered it. It wasn’t like this in 
Duluth, he boomed, it was awfully pretty down here, and he and 
Mother — obviously the plump wife-creature he had firmly by the 
elbow — were getting quite a tan from the nice Cuban sun. And they’d have 
been in to dinner earlier, only they'd been Christmas shopping. 

Dave was turning in disgust back to his beer when the woman dropped 
one of her packages, and in retrieving it, the man’s eye fell on Dave and 
Sara. 

“Why, Mother, there’s some Americans. Let’s go sit with them.” 

The hostess made a vague try at sidetracking them, but lost the battle 
with the determined old man, her face plainly showing that there was no 
arguing with turistas. He reattached himself to his wife’s elbow and 
steered her, packages in hand, toward their table. Oh god, not this, Dave 
thought, shrinking. Sara stared at the couple dully. 

They couldn’t be allowed to sit here. Heart hammering, Dave said, 
“Sorry, but we’re waiting for someone. We’d like to invite you, but — ” 

But Sara was already back in Glendale, speaking the sort of stuff you 

130 GALAXY 




said to people you’d never seen before, and wouldn’t really care if you 
never saw again. 

“ — so nice to see someone from the States. Yes, it’s lovely weather, so 
warm for Christmas.” 

The man seated his doughy wife tenderly. He stowed the packages on an 
empty chair he’d requisitioned from the next table, where a trio of 
Cubanos, deep in the throes of some business deal over dark rum, pro- 
duced a flood of liquid courtesies that even sounded genuine. They offered 
a second chair, and fell all over themselves with offers of help. Their cour- 
tesy made Dave feel like a registered crud, and his attempts at a polite 
brushoff sound like the worst possible kind of manners. 

“Steptoe’s the name,” the man was saying. He stuck out a hand, and 
Dave reluctantly shook it, pressed the be-ringed hand of his wife. ‘T was 
just telling Mother that Americans oughten’t to be alone in a foreign coun- 
try at Christmastime. Wasn’t 1, Mother? Not that I got anything against 
foreigners, seen-yores . .’’he nodded to the Cubans, “but you ought to 
be with some of your own at Christmas, I always say. Mother and I are 
from Duluth,” he said. 

“Glendale, California,” Dave said without thinking. 

The woman beamed. “Isn’t that nice? So much sunshine. But that smog 
is bad for you, I hear.” 

Sara agreed, in the way she’d learned to agree with everything. She told 
the couple their names. Just like they hadn’t decided to be completely 
anonymous. He put in loudly, “We’re, uh, on a little vacation.” He 
jerked his head toward the woman’s packages. “Doing some Christmas 
shopping.” 

“Isn’t that nice?” Mother said warmly. “For the children?” 

Damn the woman! 

“No,” Sara said bleakly. “Our son died last year.” 

“I’m so sorry,” the woman said, and her hand stole out to take her 
husband’s. 

Dave glanced at Sara, saw that her eyes were shiny with tears. He hoped 
desperately that she wasn’t going to cry in front of these strangers, ^^y 
couldn’t she have stayed home instead of coming along, wrapping herself 
around him like a noose. He could have brushed off these home-folks and 
waited it out by himself. 

“ — fishing?” the man was saying heartily, obviously trying to change 
the subject. Dave wished they would just go away and let them alone. 

“No,” he said flatly, hoping his rudeness would discourage discussion. 
But a moment’s silence discomfited him. “We’re flying back tonight,” he 
heard himself say. “By way of Galveston,” he added quickly. “Aren’t 
we, dear?” 

“Just as well you are going that way,” Mr. Steptoe said. “Safer.” 

“Safer?” Sara asked. Her face was pale, and Dave could see that she 
was frightened again. Damn the man. What was he talking about? 

“No, Father ...” Mother put in. 



BENEATH THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 



131 




“Oh, now,” Mr. Steptoe said, “I’m not what you’d call superstitious, 
but if I was you, young man. I’d not like to take the chance of flying from 
Havana, here, to Miami.” 

“Father, you just hush up,” his wife said, leaning across to brush a 
speck from his shirt front. “You’re going to bore these young people with 
your tales.” 

Dave was anything but bored. What could the old man know of their 
business in Miami? If he knew anything, and wasn’t just babbling. “What 
are you talking about?” 

llie old woman smiled. “Why, that Bermuda Triangle, dear,” she said. 
“Though why Herbert’s scaring you with that when you’re not even going 
there, I can’t imagine. You just hush up about that. Father, and order you 
some dinner. And don’t take too much of those chili peppers. You know 
how they repeat on you. He will eat those things,” she went on, turning to 
pat Sara’s hand, “lliey give him the stomach trouble. But when we come 
down here, he had to eat what the people eat. Says it’s silly to have ham- 
burgers when we could just as well stay home and eat at the Howard 
Johnson’s in Duluth.” 

Sara mumbled a response. 

Dave relaxed, curing his own paranoia. “That’s the least of my wor- 
ries,” he said, relieved, and a little louder than he intended, added, “Be- 
sides, I think all that stuff is just coincidence. Carelessness, radios going 
out, storms.” He forced a laugh. “I don’t believe in magic.” 

“I don’t s’pose you do,” the older man conceded, grinning. “Young 
people’re ^ways so busy, getting around and getting things done. Wonder 
sometimes if things need doing all that bad. ” 

His wife turned a reproving eye on him. “Why, Father! What a thing to 
say.” She tsked. “What gets into Herbert sometimes!” 

Sara smiled weakly, aird Dave looked again at the door, wishing for the 
thousandth time that Bonnie would come so they could get out of here and 
into the air, go back to Glendale where people had a decent lack of interest 
in what you thought or did, what you believed in or didn’t, and if people 
got too off-the-wall you could just go to a different party, drink with a 
different crowd. Forget the stoned-out visions of cosmic grandeur that had 
been life and breath to his younger self, but were simply an embarrassment 
to him now. Not to mention preachments from Sara, who pretended to 
have forgotten that they had ever thought anything non-scheduled, unless 
she was beating their collective breast atout Danny. 

Nobody in their crowd in Glendale regarded such things as anything but 
silly. As silly as this ridiculous story about the Bermuda Triangle. A fig- 
ment of somebody’s Newton. A thing to read dbout, watch tv shows about. 
Well, it did pass the time, waiting for Bonnie. Kept them off dangerous 
subjects, such as what they were doing here. 

“I suppose you believe in that stuf^” Dave challenged the man. 

“Son, I believe what I see and hear,” the older man replied. “And I’ve 
seen a lot. Mother has too.” He grinned at his wife’s pursed mouth. 

132 GALAXY 




“Can’t live a long time in this world without things happening that the 
big-bugs can’t explain, so they tell you you’re halloo-hallo . 

. cinating,’’ Dave finished for him. 

“Yep. Seeing things. Some of the things I’ve seen I wisht were halloo- 
cinations.’’ He tapp^ a forefinger on the table. “Some of ’em right out 
there.’’ He pointed in the general direction of the doOT. “But I saw what I 
saw, and I heard what I heard.’’ 

“And what was that?’’ Dave asked, peering around Mother to the door 
again. 

“The young woman that was lost, son. Mother and I were out there in 
our other boat, the one we had before the Marta S. ’Course, that was a 
long time ago. But I won’t ever forget it.’’ 

“Well, what happened?’’ Dave looked again at his watch. 

“We had the radio on, and we heard what she said.’’ 

Dave stared at him with impatience. “Which was?” 

“Is there any way out of this?" Mr. Steptoe quoted. “That’s what. And 
she never spoke again. She just disappeared.” 

Dave snorted. “Oh, come on.” 

He looked Dave in the eye, nodding. “Just as well you’re not going 
back in that direction, seeing what time of year it is. This is when they all 
happen.” 

“Do you want me to believe — ” Dave began. 

“Not a thing, son. You asked me, and I told you, is all. But here — ” 
Mr. Steptoe chided himself, grinning at his wife, who was opening her 
mouth to do it. “Mother told me not to be scaring you with my tales. 
Here, girlie — ” he called to the waitress who was coming with Dave’s and 
Sara’s food. “I’ll have some enchiladas, and some free-holies, and — ” 

Is there any way out of here? Dave smiled grimly to himself as the older 
man ordered hugely from the Spanish menu. He could have told the miser- 
able woman there wasn’t. Not for her, or for them. Whatever had caught 
the woman and all those other ships and aircraft, it was perfectly natu^, 
had some reasonable explanation. A better one, he’d bet, than he had for 
getting involved in this insane venture. They were all caught, though most 
of them didn’t seem to mind, or even to notice. As he tried not to notice, 
except when Sara insisted on rubbing his nose in painful “facts”. He was 
almost grateful to Mr. Steptoe for bringing up a subject he could dismiss 
as nonsense, thoroughly dispose of as he wished he could dispose of Sara’s 
irrational notions. But there was no way out of that one. 

And no way out of their venture, for as his glance turned again to the 
opening of the polished door at the far end of the restaurant, Botmie was 
there. 

Her large purse hung significantly heavy on her crooked arm. She turned 
slowly in a hip-shot model’s stance as ste searched the dim-lit restaurant 
for them, and her lipsticked mouth narrowed as she spotted them. From a 
distance of twenty feet across'the smoky, candlelit room, Dave could feel 
her anger as she saw them with company. She brushed off the hostess con- 



BENEATH THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 



133 




temptuously and stalked toward the table. 
Is there any way out of this? 

You have to be kidding. 



II 

“My god, how could you be that stupid?” Bonnie said again as Dave 
made a left turn in the rented car, swerving to avoid a group of jaywalking 
Cubans. “My god, you almost hit those spiks. You’re going to get us ar- 
rested. Slow down, for godsake. There’s a cop!” 

In the rear-view mirror, he saw her light a cigarette savagely, throw the 
match on the floor and step on it. Behind her, out the back window, paired 
streaks of multi-colored neon fire streamed backward into the depths of the 
city. Cars dropped away as Dave stubbornly kept his foot down on the gas. 
Nothing was quite as important as getting this over with, not even Bon- 
nie’s rage. They left the police car, uninterested, behind. He made another 
sharp turn. He hoped he was remembering the right way to the airport. But 
if he wasn’t, Bonnie would tell him. 

And she did. “I said, slow down, you fool! And turn at the next right!” 

Dave complied, unwillingly. The sooner this was over, the happier he 
would be. He longed for another beer, or something stronger, but he sup- 
posed he had had plenty if he was going to be able to handle the plane 
and make Miami before Bonnie’s appointment with her buyer. Tension 
weighted his foot, and without his realizing it, the speedometer needle crept 
steadily upward until Sara’s hand flashed forward to brace herself on the 
dashboard as the tires screamed into another sharp turn. The speed flag. 
What kindness he still felt for her — a poor and inadequate substitute for 
love — was wiped out by such tricks. He thought, as he had unnumbered 
times before, that he would have vastly prefeir^ her to yell. 

“I said, slow down!" Bonnie shout^ in his ear. Sara bit her lip, and 
kept the bracing hand on the dashboard. 

He mashed down on the brake, eliciting a hysterical latin barrage of 
honking from the driver following, who had had to brake too. Thereafter, 
he drove exactly at the speed limit, taking enough of his attention to put it 
somewhere other than in the unfamiliar car with its all-too-familiar distrac- 
tions, intolerable now past hearing. 

Following the rules silenced Bonnie and, as always, mollified Sara. The 
tension was silent, but it was no less, and he raised his eyes, when breaks 
in the traffic would let him, to the night sky that was no more visible here 
than in Los Angeles. The quarter moon was just clearing the top of a pre- 
tentious office building some distance ahead. Its face was a dull orange — 
smog moonlight. He distracted himself from the task and the worry by re- 
calling how the moon looked from up there, pure and luminous. One of 
the fringe benefits of flying. He had refused to give it up even when Sara’s 
concern had her plumping for everything in the book as an alternative to 
flying. Anything on how to make a living. Anything but living. 



134 



GALAXY 




Had she forgotten how it was up there? 

He knew she had. Deliberately forgotten! She would sacrifice anything 
to the well-being of his body, though care of Danny’s had not saved him. 
It didn’t make any sense. And he had to admit, though no alternatives had 
presented themselves, that what he was doing didn’t make any either. If he 
could find some way to make her remember flying with him — tripping to- 
gether. But tripping was a dangerous subject, a dangerous word. It made 
Sara cry, and Sara crying made Dave rage. There was no safe way to re- 
make the crystalline contact, no way for either of them to truly remember 
what it had been like. 

To fly, to forget gravity, ignore entropy, turn away from the face of the 
mob that moved on the surface, forget the clutching, grabbing, scrabbling 
creatures that called themselves sentient while they were slaves to rules 
that made no sense. All irrelevant, from up there. All pointless. Some part 
of you — of everyone that had ever been there — stayed up when the body 
come down, remembering what it was like. If they let themselves. 

But another part saw and hated Sara’s tremulous and ill-hidden relief 
when he did come down. The ex-mother, begging with her eyes, with the 
way she held herself, with the trivial comforts of kitchen and bedroom, 
pleading with him to give up the freedom of the air and stay on the 
ground. She had lost something essential, something that vivified. Her 
capacity to care had decayed, day by day, becoming fussiness. She had 
squeezed the life out of herself by clinging, and out of Dave by clinging to 
him, setting herself to serve her thwarted maternity in ways that drained 
his inner essence. 

There’s no way out, he thought bitterly. You never really escape. Grav- 
ity was always there, whether you chose to let it be or not. The pull. The 
drag. 

He refused to let himself glance at her to see if she was still nervous. 
She was clutching, he knew, the eternal kleenex, buffing dust off the toes 
of her shoes, picking lint off the pressed legs of her pant suit, checking 
her face, her hair. All the arsenal of structured time-passers. Even when 
“the Dreadful” had already happened. 

Ah Sara ... are you in there? 

As though she had heard him, she put out a hand and rested it lightly on 
his thigh. Tension hummed in his thigh muscles, and he turned Ids mind 
back to the sky to escape it. 



Ill 

In the air, poised between the quiescent sea and the clear midnight sky, 
some of the tightness began to loosen. The headwind, which had ruffled 
the tops of the breakers on the beach as they passed over it, heading out 
across the open ocean, had thinned and died. As perfect a night for Hying 
as he could have wished for. Even Sara was relatively calm. Her hands no 
longer twisted and clutched. He could almost believe that the task would 



BENEATH THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 



135 




go off without a hitch, if you left out the Steptoes. Small stabs of discom- 
fort plagued him until they actually took to the air. Had he said something 
stupid to them, revealed too much? But the pure luminosity of the stars 
and moon in the darkness soothed him. They flew steadily north, the lull- 
ing hum of the engine a mantra of peace. 

Bonnie sat aft, immersed in the semi-completion of her business. She 
had had the good sense to keep her mouth shut during take-off, and Dave 
could ignore he'r piercing glances, as though he couldn’t get into the air 
without her supervision. 

The cloudless night was alive with the flash and glitter of the far stars, 
interspersed with the nearer and steadier glow of the above-the-horizon 
planets. Around the unoccluded moon, a haze of moonlight spread out to 
obscure the stars nearest it with silvery light. With his peripheral vision, he 
caught the cyclic off-on wink of a yet nearer star. An artificial satellite, he 
guessed, recalling a long-gone night on the beach with an equally long- 
gone Sara, when coming down from the sweat and transport of acid, they 
had lain and watched another such object, following its soundless, dotted- 
line arc from northwest to its disappearance in the skirts of the southwest 
glow where the city lay. 

“Look there,” he said to Sara, pointing. “Isn’t that pretty?” 

Sara looked, nodded. 

“About a half hiiTIion dollars worth of pretty!” Bonnie’s voice drew 
their attention back into the plane. Turning from the sky and the wink of 
the object, now seen, now lost in the star-scattered blackness, they saw 
that the emeralds lay in her lap. 

“Pretty, for sure.” She laughed exultantly and took one out of its case, 
holding it to her eye and looking through it at the moon. She put that one 
back, took up another, turning it from side to side, the huge stone catching 
the inside lights of the cabin and breaking it into prismatic sparks. 

A knot of small islands appeared on the horizon ahead, and crawled 
across the surface of the ocean, the lights of dwellings disappearing under 
them. Dave turned back to check his instruments, but the coruscating dis- 
traction of her play with the stone made it hard to see. Harder, really, than 
it should have been. He glanced at the fuel gauge, and found that it regis- 
tered higher than it should have. Maybe there was a tailwind at this al- 
titude. That was good. But the sparks of emerald light made it hard to read 
the compass. He could have sworn that it was wavering, but he told him- 
self that it was his imagination. He glanced at it more closely, but it 
seemed alright. The expected next group of small islands was coming up 
right on schedule. Yes, there was the village he remembered from the trip 
out, and a dim light or two here and there. A somewhat brighter single 
light went out as he watched it. A pang shot through him, as though he 
had seen someone die. More mind-trips and paranoia. He called himself 
names savagely. It was only somebody going late to bed in a house on the 
side of a hill. 

He checked his compass again, saw that it was again appearing to 
136 GALAXY 




waver. “Put that stuff away, and quit jiggling it around,” he shot back 
over his shoulder. “You’re making it hard to see, flashing lights around.” 

Bonnie laughed, but the laugh was chopped off as the plane took a sick- 
ening drop. Loose objects, including the stones in their nests of velvet, 
sprang into the air, scattering across the floor. Sara’s gasp was drowned in 
Bonnie’s shriek. “What d’ you think you’re doing?” She went after the 
stones, scrabbling on hands and knees. Stuffing them back in their case, 
she shouted, “What did that? What’s the matter?” 

Dave didn’t answer. His attention was on the plane. Heart pounding, he 
brought the nose up carefully, regained his lost altitude, climbed a little. 
The compass definitely was acting strangely. The illusion of flickering 
lights remained, even after Bonnie put the stones in their box and clicked 
the lock into place. More turbulence dropped them again, though not so far 
as the first time. Dave struggled with the wheel, through which he could 
feel a disquieting vibration, and ignored both Bonnie’s yelp of outrage and 
Sara’s sudden grasp on his thigh. The business-as-usual view out the front 
windscreen reproached him. He racked his brain, trying to figure out what 
was going on, what he had done wrong. 

Automatically, he checked his instruments again as his hands turned the 
wheel to the left. But the glance turned to fix^ horror as he saw that the 
compass was no longer wavering, but spinning counterclockwise. The fuel 
gauge flopped like a metronome — full, empty, full, empty — measuring out 
seconds of terrible wrongness. 

“Dave, what’s wrong?” Sara’s voice was high-pitched with over- 
control, but it rose in terror as she suddenly cried out, “What’s that?” 

Outside the plane, a blue glow was thickening. The stars had disap- 
peared. Even the moon was gone into an azure phosphorescense that clung 
to the nose and wings as though the plane had excreted it. They flew in a 
blind, blue fog. 

“\^at is that?” Sara repeated, clutching at him frantically, as though 
naming it fixed it. 

But there was no name he could put to it, or to the crazy spinning of his 
compass, the maddening sweep of his fuel gauge, the vibration that made 
him clutch the wheel. The vibration grew, threatening to tear the wheel 
from his hands. He fought its inexplicable waywardness without respond- 
ing either to Sara’s cries or to Bonnie’s command of “Stop it right now!” 

Bracing the wheel with one hand and his right knee, he reached for the 
radio microphone, knocking Sara’s hand off his thigh. He thumbed the 
switch. “Mayday! Mayday! This is Roger-Charlie-Etog four eight seven 
Baker. In trouble over — ” He paused for a split eternity to think. “Moselle 
Reef. Instruments not reliable. Lots of turbulence. Mayday! Mayday! Any- 
body copy? Mayday!” 

Bonnie stumbled forward. She grabbed his shoulder, knocking the mi- 
crophone out of his hand. It fell with a clunk. Sara hurried to retrieve it and 
tried to hand it back, but Bonnie struck it from her fingers. “Stop it! I 
know what you’re up to,” she raged. “You better hope nobody out there 



BENEATH THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 



137 




heard that. We’re not in trouble. You’re trying to pull something!” 

Dave groped frantically for the microphone. “You crazy bitch!” he 
shouted, eyes on the mad oscillation of the indicators. “Look at that!” He 
jerked his head toward the instrument panel, not daring to take his hand 
from the wheel. “And that!” He repeated the jerk in the direction of the 
windscreen where the glow of the plane’s nose was growing in the seconds 
of futile struggle. “Do you think I’m doing that?” 

“Yes . yes,” she screamed, still fighting for the mike. “I know 
you’re doing it. And you’d better stop it. Right now, you — ” 

“We’re falling ...” Sara cried shrilly. The steep downward plunge 
threw her forward, threw Dave against the instrument panel, flung Bonnie 
against the bulkhead, screaming, “Stop it . stop it . stop it . !” 

But there was no stopping it. The wrinkled moonlit sea rushed up to- 
ward them, empty now of islands, barren. Empty of hope. And Dave, the 
pilot in him desperately pulling on the wheel, trying to pull the nose up, 
knew from the angle of their descent that it was all over. 

He tried to see Sara out of the comer of his eye. But she was staring 
transfixed at the uprushing sea. 

“Not me. Not now. Not me . .” Bonnie was repeating as they fell. 
There was time enough for a laugh to force itself between his clenched 
teeth. 

And then they hit. 



IV 

Hello, God. This is Snappy Dave Connell, and everything I’ve ever been 
taught about dying is wrong. 

I know I’m dead, coz we fell in the ocean, me and Sara and this crazy 
bitch Bonnie and her pretty green rocks, and I’m a hot pilot and I know 
we didn’t make it— I know we hit even tho I don’t remember it 
especially — hell, I don’t remember it at all. I do recall that I went out 
laughing, like I always that I would back in the old acid days, at the 
stupidity of it all, the pointlessness, the futility of fighting it. 

At least I had the sense to turn off my mind (I think), relax, and float 
downstream. 

I’m dead. 

So why do I keep on thinking that the plane, too, is floating, sinking 
down slowly thru the cool translucence of Reisling seen thru a wineglass? 

fVhy, God? 

Why am I still sitting in the cockpit of this plane, and from somewhere 
hearing my wife freaking out and that other crazy bitch screaming at me to 
do something? 

What am I supposed to do? I’m dead. 

Merry Christmas, Connell. 

The man was right. I can’t quite believe it — I know I’m dead and pretty 
soon I’m going to either hear flights of angels or come to the Clear Light 

138 GALAXY 




or some damn thing. Which Bardo is this? I should have read more, or 
remembered what I read, coz I'm no way in the world ready to die just 
yet, coz / can’t remember how it’s done. 

But evidently I did it. 

Hey, God? 

Nobody told me you lost your marbles when you died. I could swear I 
was still sinking, that the plane was sinking with me in it — and Sara, and 
all — and that it’s still settling, quiet as that off-on UFO we saw, falling 
forever thru the upper air, right before everything went completely crazy 
and we lost it. That was an artificial satellite, a Sputnik or somesuch, 
wasn’t it? 

I am down in the Atlantic in the Bermuda Triangle. I am a freaking 
statistic. All of us are statistics. How ’bout that? And nobody knows what’s 
down here — ru?t that it matters now. You were right, Mr. Steptoe. Wish you 
were here instead of me. 

That is ridiculous. 

I move my dead arm and it responds, and I put it over and around my 
dead wife, who probably needs some comfort right now, really needs it for 
a change, coz some people get all freaked out when they die suddenly, I 
remember, and / give her a hug arul I say, "You alright, honey?’’ 

She flings out both arms to grab onto me, but the seat belt holds her 
down, and she is crying madly now, having something to cry about. 
"Wha . what’s . hap . happening to us?’’ 

And I answer, unbelievable cool, "We’re dead, that’ sail." 

The other one, this crazy woman I didn’t even know when we were 
alive, and for sure don’t know now, is yelling from where she’s sprawled 
on the floor, surrounded by all the junk that was loose in the plane, plus 
those totally-pointless-now hunks of green glass that have cost us our lives, 
because being dead, what good are they? 

"You maniac . you . you . you think you can get away with 
this? I've got people who are going to come looking for me when I don’t 
show up. Big people. You get us out of here right this minute!" 

You hear that, God? She thinks I’m God. 

I think it’s raining. Pretty silly too, coz it doesn’t rain underwater or 
when you’re dead. I could swear I hear the musical drip-drip-drip of water 
droplets falling and because I’m still tied to my body in some weird 
way — damn this lap strap — Tm hearing . things. 

Oh, god, it's hard to really die. To get free from the semblances of the

won’t let you do it in peace, but pulls your dead hair and hits you and 
keeps yelling in your ear. And some-other-body keeps on crying in terror

Leave your vessel. 

Well, what do you think I’m trying to do? Do you go out thru the top of 
the head, or out the Muladhara Chakra? Refresh my memory. I knew it all 
once, but I’ve forgotten most of it trying to live in Glendale. And you — 
gosh, you look funny with that tall pointy head and that funhouse outfit 
that looks like Star Wars, and you have too many fingers and all the 
wrong shape — you’re supposed to be helping me, arent you? Tell 
me .. help me out. Hey! Are you the Dweller on the Threshold? 

Leave your vessel. 

You’re a broken record, guy. A great guide across the River of Death. 
Td leave in a minute if 1 knew how. You don’t think I like it here, do you? 
You don’t think I’d be here, strapped into this death-box at the bottom of 
the ocean, if I knew how to leave? Who let you in, funny creature? And 
you’re not anything like I expected you to be. You’re not — 

V 

/ am Argos. You will leave your vessel. 

The alien’s head reached nearly to the roof. It was needle-thin, and 
needle-shiny, clad in a close-fitting garment of metallic stuff. Its feet and 
hands were slabs of maggot-color^ bloodless meat, ending in a cluster of 
boneless digits. Its face was no face at all — no mouth, no nose, just a little 
more highly colored streak across its tall head, and eyes of a reflecting 
silver, too huge, below its mushrooming head. 

Dave’s hand released his safety belt and he flung himself toward a rack 
of tools. Grabbing the nearest, a wrench, he felt he had eternities to swing 
it, felt himself rise from the floor as though he were dreaming it. He 
smashed the creature across the side of the head with the wrench, and it 
fell, folding in the middle as though its center contained the only joint in 
its body. It clanked as it struck the deck, its rubbery limbs going sprawl- 
ing. 

Blood roared and pounded in his ears. He shook sweat from his eyes, 
trying to see the creature clearly. Its head was smashed like a windowpane, 
the translucent dead-white skin tom laterally, showing the cartilaginous 
bones beneath. There was blood — it must be blood though it wasn’t red — 
seeping like tree sap from the wound. 

Sara cried, “You killed it!’’ She had freed herself from the seat belt and 
was turning to run through the open hatchway. 

Dave grabbed her arm as she tried to pass him. “Don’t go out there!’’ 
he gabled. “There may be more of — whatever they are.” 

Bonnie scrambled to her feet and came closer, peering down. Her eyes 
narrowed. She clutched the emerald case to her breast. 

“Get back,” Dave said, motioning both women away from the door. 
“I’m going to look out and see if there are any more out there. ” Adrenalin 
rushed in his body. As he stepped over the grotesquely folded body of the 
alien, oozing milk of magnesia blood, a harsh laugh rose in his throat. It 

140 GALAXY 




shocked him. He had never killed, and felt only revulsion. It took him a 
second or two to realize that the bark was not some atavistic shout of 
triumph but an avoidance based on disbelief. He had killed this creature. 
Killed. He, himself. 

“I’m glad you think this is funny,” Bonnie hissed. She was pale, almost 
as pale as the creature. 

Sara was nearly as blanched as Bonnie, but she stood straight and 
looked Dave in the eye. He could almost believe that she understood. He 
clapped his left hand over his mouth to keep from making another sound 
and raised the wrench again in his right. 

Looking through the window, he could see that a metal gangway had 
been put up to the hatch of the plwe. No more of the creatures were on it. 
With a sweep of his eye across a brightly lit domed structure, floored with 
water except for a narrow stretch of flat beach, he could see that no more 
of them lurked near the plane. “It’s clear, he said. “We’re in some kind 
of huge . room, it looks like from here. At least, there’s something that 
looks like a door over there. The thing must have come in that way.” He 
avoided looking at the dead thing again, but he felt his mouth quiver with 
a suppressed laugh. Incredulity erupting again. 

“The plane’s sitting in water, and how we’ll ever get it back in the air, I 
don’t know.” He would not think now of what might lie above them — 
miles of water, or whatever. “Sara, look out the other window and see 
what’s out there. If there are more of those things on the other side we’U 
have to be careful getting out of here. ” 

Bonnie snorted. “Well, don’t think you’re taking the stones with you 
when you go.” She shook the case. “These stay right here with me. I 
don’t know where you think you’re going, anyway. You don’t know 
what’s on the other side of that door. Or maybe you do, but I’m staying 
right here until help comes.” She crossed to the pilot’s seat and sat in it, 
still clutching the case. She picked up the mike. “How do you make this 
work? Oh, I see.” She pushed in the switch on the side of the mi- 
crophone. “Hello . hello. Anybody there?” A crackle of static was the 
only answer. ‘ ‘Hello ...” 

Sara was at the opposite window. “Dave, come look at this.” 

Joining her, the wrench still in his hand, Dave looked out the window. 
They were not, after all, in a room, but in a gigantic bubble that might 
have held a whole city. The downward curve of the opposite wall was so 
far from the plane that he could see no beach, though it must have been 
encircled by ^e same narrow stretch of sand. At intervals, the bubble was 
set with door-like openings, though all were shut. A netwoilc of lights il- 
luminated it, strung on some invisible network set in the reflective material 
of the dome. The intense, yellow-white light stared pitilessly down on a 
gently swelling floor of seawater, out of which rose, to the right of where 
the plane sat in the shallows, a derelict pile of rubbish reaching roughly a 
third of the way to the roof. Planes, and parts of planes. Crushed, broken 
and tom, soaked with seawater and stacked like cord- wood against the far 

BENEATH THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 141 




wall of the dome. 

“Are they. ?” Sara faltered. 

“Yes,” Dave answered grimly. A large fragment of one of the planes, 
an old low-wing Tamco that lay a little nearer than the rest, was sticking 
up out of the sand with its nose and one wing intact, reaching to the van- 
ished sky like a crushed bird. A flat white, disarrayed pile of bones, ob- 
viously human, lay across the step and out onto the sand. There was no 
skull, only a collapsed ribcage, arms and hands, and the backbone. The 
skeleton ended at the third vertebra above the shoulders. 

Sara caught the narrowing of his eyes as he peered, transfixed with 
shock. “What’s ...” 

“Never mind. There’s nothing in the world we can do for anybody who 
was in those planes.” He pulled her away before she could look closer. 
“We have to get out of here.” 

“But where are we going to go?” Sara hesitated as he urged her toward 
the door. 

“Out of here. We’re not just going to sit here and wait for something to 
happen.” He started to follow her, passed the rack of tools where he had 
obtained the wrench. He selected a much larger one, and dropped the first. 
For the first time in his life, he wished he had a gun. But seeing again the 
body of the alien thing where it had fallen, he supposed that he could 
make do with what came to hand if he had to. “Are you coming with 
us?” 

Bonnie turned and gave him a look of scorn, then turned back to the 
microphone, helloing into the silence. 

He pushed past Sara and stepped out onto the gangway, taking her by 
the hand with him. They were alone. No voices or other sounds of life 
disturbed the quiet, in which he could hear the soft, waveless splash of the 
water on the tail of the plane. At the foot of the gangway, the alien’s foot- 
prints, narrow and triangular with the widest part toward the heel, marred 
the damp sand. It was strange, Dave thought, 'that there were no drag 
marks showing the movement of the gangway. 

The footprints led directly to the door opposite where their plane sat. 
Best to avoid that door, though there were no guarantees as to what he 
might find behind the others. Could there be water behind the doors? 

He forced himself to recall the look of the alien’s smashed head — though 
he would have liked to expunge the scene Ifom his mind forever — to see if 
he could remember it having had gills, or anything that might serve as 
gills. But there was nothing. It had had no nose, but from what he recalled 
it was not apparently a water-breather. He hurried Sara down the beach 
toward the next door. But the sand there was disturbed, kicked about by 
milling footprints. And from that door several other sets of overlapping 
prints led off in the direction of the heap of wrecked aircraft. These were 
not the triangular prints of the creatures, but appeared human. But none of 
them led away from the door, all were going in. No escape, at least not 
from here. 



142 



GALAXY 




Dave swallowed hard. Pushing Sara in front of him now, he quickened 
his pace, and made for the next door. The sand was flat and undisturbed 
between the place where the human footprints came up out of the water 
and the door, some fifty yards distant. The only sound was the ragged 
gasping of their breath and a slight buzzing in Dave’s ears. They ran heav- 
ily through the loose sand and finally reached the door. Dave let out his 
breath in a heavy sigh of relief when he saw that there were no footmarks, 
either human or alien, on the sand in front of it. But the buzzing in his 
ears was growing. It was an electronic hum, maybe it was the power for 
the lights. 

The door had an air and moisture seal around it, and was rounded at top 
and bottom. About eighteen inches higher than a doorknob would have 
been there was a wheel. Whatever else might be down here, the door had 
obviously been installed for the use of the much taller aliens. But it was 
not too high to reach. He put up his hand, grasped it, and gave a tug. It 
refused to turn. He wiped sweat from his palm and jerked on it again, 
hauling with all his weight. Nothing. It hung there, too high, mocking 
him. It ought to turn, dammit. It had to turn! He swung up the wrench, 
enraged and desperate, and brought it down with a resounding clang on the 
metal wheel. Still nothing. He hit it again. And again. Sweat reached his 
eyes, stinging. His hands were slippery with it, and he nearly lost his grasp 
on the wrench. 

Feeling something clinging to his arm, he swung around, raising the 
wrench. 

“Dave . Dave, please! Try turning it the other way. At least try it. 
All that noise . somebody . something might hear it!’’ He could 
hardly hear her with the pounding of his heart and the increasing buzzing 
noise in his ears. 

But he understood through his panic, and cursed himself for losing his 
temper and his common sense. He tried to smile, but from her grimace he 
knew he’d failed. “Okay . it’s okay,’’ he said, too loud, over the buzz- 
ing. He swung the wrench and banged it downward on the wheel in the 
other direction. It gave a little, and his relief was so great when he reached 
up to pull it around that he laughed aloud. He could feel Sara’s breath on 
his ear as she cried out, “Thank God!’’ She clutched his shoulder. 
“Thank—’’ 

The door hit the outer wall with a clang. There were many aliens behind 
it, and the noise of their weapons — if they made any — was drowned in an 
engulfing explosion of white-out fog that wrapped around him before he 
had time to think of anything, of the discarded wrench, of Sara, of fighting 
back. He plunged into a sickening downward spiral, his hands searching 
for the familiar slick plastic of the wheel. Got to get control of the plane 
coz we’re falling. I’m losing it. But the domed, underwater world was fad- 
ing, fading . and gone. 

Pop! 

Oh Lord . this is really it this time. 

BENEATH THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 143 




This time I know I am dead. I have to be, because they'd never let me 
live after I smashed one of them up. Killed him . her . it? 

But this time I know it. 

/ can see . though everything is misty ... my body lying down there. 

That’s strange. Why does it seem to be down? Oh yeah. Everything 
looks down from up here. 1 remember this from somewhere, but I can’t 
recall just ^here. Not a bad body. Good while it lasted. But getting soft. 
In the head. All the same, Lwas pretty fond of it. And of her, down there 
struggling. Hey! It’s no use, honey. I’m dead. You can quit fussing coz it’s 
happened. Quit struggling. Sara, don’t fight it. I’m dead and that’s all 
there is to it. Lordy, what a fighter. Never knew she was such a scrapper. 
Well yeah, I did. But that was such a long time ago, and she’s gotten 
so ... so smothering. Fusses. Over Danny — tho God knows she had re- 
ason to fuss over him. Over me, like now. Made me feel old and tired. 

But I guess Tm not going to have to sweat that any more. Am I? Am I, 
you. Whoever comes to get you when you're really dead? 

Well? 

Sara, you’re crying. I see you down there, trying to knock those crea- 
tures out of the way and get to my body. But I’m not in there. That’s not 
me. So you don’t have to cry and carry on and fight them. And even if 
there’s no chance for you to get away you can come with me. I’m here — 
up here! Just wait. I see — and how I see I couldn’t tell you — that they 
can’t carry you. They’re too fragile, too weak to carry anything as heavy 
as a human body. I suppose they’re going to leave my body lying there till 
it goes to bones like that other poor guy in the Tamco. Pity about that. I 
liked it, tho I never got a whole lot of good out of it the last little while. 
You liked it too, though you coddled it too much. That’s right, go with 
them. You can figure out a way to get free. 

Hey! What’s that they’re doing with my body? What’s that thing? A 
whole gang of them, raising my body and putting it on something like a 
stretcher, but it doesn’t have any handles. It rises, no kidding, rises in the 
air by itself. So that’s how they got the gangway out to the plane without 
leaving tracks. 

What do they want with it? Even if it is mine. Especially one that has a 
smoky rope attached to it. A rope that goes, bigod, it goes to right here, 
right into me! I can look down and see where it goes into my stomach, 
plugged in there and pulsing. I reach to touch it. 

I can see my hands. My very own hands with the square blunt nails, and 
that’s my wedding ring on the left one, and on the right, my opal that I 
bought while I was dealing arui had money, to spend on trinkets and pret- 
ties. And now I don’t have enough money to pay the mortgage and I wind 
up on a crazy trip like — 

Hey, guys. Somebody? Anybody? I could relax and float downstream if 
somebody would answer the phone. Get the thing, and make the buzzing 
stop. 

It’s coming from this direction. If I Just keep moving, I can get to it and 

144 GALAXY 




turn it off. Down this hall. Here’s the door. That design on the door there 
seems to have worn well. Kept its colors. The star in the center seems to 
float somewhere behind the rest of the sigil. You could reach out and touch 
it and feel as though you were putting your hand thru the door. And 
strangely, you do. But not really so strange. That’s what the design was 
for. And all the rest follows. 

Follows the star, which won’t stay still, but moves, rearranges itself, 
some above, some below. Triangles joined to triangles, and it shapes itself 
into a pyramid, the door with the star opens, and / enter, / am inside it, 
before the crystal that is also a pyramid, with the Seat of Power at the 
Place of Power, the crystal steps ascending. 

/ look up and see a figure there, a man long-haired and robed, with the 
green glow of an emerald on his forehead. 

This is too much. I’m hallucinating. If he’s the one who is supposed to 
collect my soul after death, he sure doesn’t look too happy about it. 

VI 

— / greet you in the name of the Twelve — he says. — / am Arien, guard- 
ian of the Crystal . — 

I don’t want to sound like a broken record, but I say, — Are you the 
Dweller on the Threshold? — 

This gets something like a grin from his haggard face, and he says, 
— You will not contend with that One until you come to the holy place in 
the flesh . — 

—Flesh ? — I say, startled. — Then I’m not dead this time, either? — 

— You live, and have left your body. Your spirit is drawn by the power 
of the Cyrstal . — He comes down the steps as though floating above them. 
— Listen to me. We have not much time before your body awakens, and I 
have much to show you . — 

— Well, if I’m not dead, then where am I? — 

— That I shall show you. For many cycles I have waited, waiting in the 
holy place, and have watched the Invaders spread their nets for victims. 
To some I have spoken, but none have met the Dweller in their flesh and 
lived to free the Crystal and themselves . — And he comes closer to me. I 
see the huge stone on his forehead glowing green with energy. If Bonnie 
ever saw that stone she’d flip. A piercing ray comes from it and spreads 
around me. 

I see pictures in the light of the emerald he wears. We stand together on 
a high place and view a city spread out below us. It’s laid out in circles, 
and I know that it’s no city I have ever sien before, but it’s familiar some- 
how. People are moving on the streets below, vehicles, traffic bustling. He 
gives a call like a muezzin, and they look up. I look down, and I see that 
we’re standing in a window, high up on the side of a pyramid, like the 
pyramids of Egypt, but this ain’t Egypt. 

— Behold Poseidia — he tells me. 



BENEATH THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 



145 




— Poseidia ? — / say, puzzled. 

— / see that you have knowledge of our land, though I see in your mind 
it has been sunk these many centuries below the waves. Require under- 
standing of yourself . — He turns and taps me on the forehead, a peculiar, 
syncopated rhythm, and all of a sudden / realize that what he’ s showing 
me is what we call Atlantis, but they called 'it something else. And that 
means that the pyramid we're standing on has been ten thousand years 
under the sea. 

Under the sea. I begin to get it, and he smiles his haggard smile, know- 
ing it. 

— Your body lies in the precincts of this same pyramid. You were brought 
here by the Invaders, as others have been brought. Through the centuries 
they have used humans as a means to draw out the crystal’s energy. They 
themselves cannot do so, for they are not as we. They cannot enter into 
contact with one another or with the Greater Harmony. Knowing much, 
but understanding little, they imagine that the brain is all. And so human 
brains they employ to direct the crystal’s energy to their ships. Their sci- 
ence is great, their spirits small. Many are the travellers — navigators, cap- 
tains of ships, pilots of aircraft — that they have captured and used. But / 
see that you know this. / give thanks to the Power that you came here in 
spite of danger . — 

Lord, has he got it all wrong! Jim Dandy to the rescue — I can’t let him 
believe a lie about me, so I say, — Look, I’m not here because I’m a good 
guy. Yes, I knew about it. But I have to tell you that I didn’t believe it, I 
thought it was all coincidence, the stories about this place . — / try to look 
him in the eye, make him understand. — I’m a crook, sir. A lawbreaker . — 

— It is well that you do not try to hide it. I understand your purpose. 
Nevertheless, the Power has used you, and you will use It to drive out the 
Invaders, these disruptors of Harmony, from another world . — 

— Sir, I’m just a guy. I don’t know what I can do to .. — 

But he’s smiling for real now. — Listen, and I will tell you. The Holy 
Object is not a machine, but a crystal. As such, its energy does not decay, 
but lives on though it is sunk beneath the water. Its energy field enclosed 
it, protecting it. It lives now. But it must be directed by a priest in his 
flesh. My body died in the cataclysm, arul I can no longer utilize it. For 
that, you must serve. Other captives have been here, have broken free of 
their captors and come to the holy place. But most imagined that they 
dreamed, or that they were mad. Some did go mad and killed themselves 
when they realized what the Invaders meant to do . — 

— Then how am I going to .. — 

— Observe this device, — he tells me, pointing to the green stone on his 
forehead. — All others like it will serve to focus the energy of the crystal. 
We used them to heal bodies, hear thoughts. All the captives had such 
stones on their bodies, or near them. But none have been such that they 
could lay aside the personality and become one with the crystal, as I see 
you can do . — 



146 



GALAXY 




— Let me get this straight. You want me to get back into my body and 
take over the crystal from the aliens and destroy them? How am I sup- 
posed to do this? I’m not a priest. I’m just a man . — 

— You must obtain one of the stones from the woman. The Invaders are 
bringing her now to the chamber where your body lies. It will lead you to 
the chamber of the Power. You must mount the steps on which you first 
saw me. The crystal will show you what you must do . — 

— That’s not a whole lot to go on. Get the stone. How will I .. — 

— You will know. Everything important is obvious . — 

— Sut . — 

— You must return. Remember . — 

‘ ‘Remember. ’ ’ 

Hearing him speak, Sara leaped up and ran to the table on which Dave’s 
body was lying. He sat up and swung his legs over the edge, a terrible 
urgency prodding him into action. A warning hum keened in his ears, he 
had heard it before. They were coming. 

Wildly, he looked around the room for some weapon, but there was noth- 
ing. The bare, shining walls and tables stared back at him blankly. The 
room had three doors, featureless except for the wheel in the center of 
each. This was a cell. He knew the doors would be locked, except when 
the aliens brought prisoners or took them away to be robbed of their 
brains. Panic rose like sour bile in his throat. Sara tried to make him sit 
down. She obviously couldn’t hear the humming that threatened to burst 
his eardrums. 

He had to do something! Find some weapon! Only if he could over- 
power the alien bringing Bonnie (How did he know there was only one?) 
could he follow his instructions. 

He looked down. Sara’s boots! High, with pointed heels. 

He pushed her down on a bench and knelt, ripping down the zippers of 
the boots. “What are you — ’’ 

“Here, take this.” He shoved one of the boots into her hand and jerked 
her over to the door that made his ears hum most loudly. 

“Be quiet. They’re coming,” he whispered savagely. Her face twisted 
in terror. “Bonnie will come through first. Let her by, then hit the thing 
with the boot heel. When it’s down, run through the door.” 

The wheel in the door was turning. He held the boot high. The door 
swung open, and Bonnie entered, a single alien behind her. Sara froze, as 
he had been afraid she might. Dave hit the alien with all his strength. It 
folded, toppling. He swung the boot again, hitting it squarely between the 
eyes. 

Bonnie whirled around. “You fool,” she screamed. The emerald case 
was in her hand. She swung it at him. “He wasn’t going to do anything. 
What did you hit him for? You — ” 

He caught the case as it swung, ripped it out of her hand. Holding her 
off, he cracked it on the wall, and it burst open, scattering the stones. She 
clawed him as he grabbed for one. He pushed her away and she fell. Her 



BENEATH THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 



147 




head hit the floor with a crack. In the silence, his ears began to hum again. 
More aliens were on their way. Across the room, one of the other door- 
wheels began to turn. 

“Get out!” he yelled to Sara. He grabbed her, pulled her through the 
open door, threw all his weight on it, and slammed it shut. 

He spun the wheel until he heard something click, hoped to god it was 
locked, but hadn’t a second to waste making sure. He turned quickly, 
squinting in the gloom of the hall, then spun around as he heard crackling. 
An ozone smelling haze came spreading through the door. Metal melted 
and wept molten drops down the door’s surface. The door-wheel quivered 
but didn’t turn. Dave let out an incredulous gasp as he realized that the 
weapon had locked the door behind them. 

Where to run to? There’s wasn’t much light in here. It was evidently not 
part of the alien’s regular quarters. Narrowing his eyes, he could see that 
they were in a furniture-cluttered hall, lit by globular fixtures, not bright, 
but quite enough to reveal them if they didn’t get away fast before the 
aliens burst through. 

Where to run to? Where to go? 

He ran a sweating hand down his pants leg. There was a lump in his 
pocket. The emerald he had thrust there as Bonnie grappled with him! As 
his fingers touched it, he knew which way to go. “Come on,” he croaked. 

They ran, clattering and stumbling, through a maze of halls, 
passageways, rooms. Even as he ran, towing Sara, Dave felt a pulling, a 
guidance that let him know the right way. They were nearly at the end of 
their strength when he saw, across a gallery, something he recognized. A 
mammoth double door with a six-pointed star on it. He ran for it, flung 
himself at it. It swung open and they fell through into total darkness. 

They heard a sound like the sigh of a giant turning in his sleep. With the 
sound, a sub-sonic hum thrummed under their feet. Without any warning, 
everything was lit. 



VII 

Sara caught her breath. But Dave, hand on the emerald in his pocket, 
knew where they were. Up there, at the top of those steps, he had seen the 
priest. This was the crystal, lit from beneath with a living glow. 

This was it, the thing he had seen in his vision. He half expected to see 
the drawn face of Arien peering down at him from the seat at the top of 
the translucent stairs. The Place of Power." 

But there was no priest there. There was no living being other than 
themselves in the spacious chamber. There was no Twelve in the seats of 
the Twelve. No acolytes that he knew should be at the bank of switches 
behind the shining height of the crystal. It’s living ascendance was alone 
here. Alone with two grubby, panting humans that somehow had been 
drawn to it. 

He drew the emerald out of his pocket and held it up. It caught the 
148 



GALAXY 




piercing light of the mammoth crystal and took fire from it. He put his 
hands on Sara’s shoulders. “You alright?” The emerald touched her flesh, 
and a shiver ran through her body. Her head, which had been drooping, 
came up. Some reflection, it seemed, from the verdant fires of the 
emerald, caught in her eyes, and she drew a shaky breath. “Yes. You’re 
going to have to do something here, aren’t you? Something dangerous?” 

He nodded, wondering how to tell her. But suddenly he knew that he 
wasn’t going to have to tell her. She smiled with sudden genuine pride. 
“Well, go ^ead then.” She turned away from him, crossing to the row of 
seats where the Twelve had sat. She sat down, laid her arms along the 
arms of the chair. 

Dave crossed the chamber to the darkened bank of switches. As he 
passed around the crystal, he imagined it looked at him searchingly, pon- 
dering whether he could wield the thing. Or maybe it was the invisible 
eyes of the priest on him, the last servitor of the crystal, waiting to see 
him press the panels that would turn that unearthly light into directed 
energy. 

The switches, crystal plates set flush with their surrounding panel, were 
dark. He knew they would light up when he pushed the right ones, and 
that they would be ^ryl-green, like the stone he held in his hand. 

In his hand. Sudden dizziness swept over him as he remembered 
that the stone was to be bound to his forehead, if its placement on the head 
of Arien in his vision was clear. He rummaged his pockets, found nothing 
to use to bind it. He passed the back of his hand across his eyes, and sud- 
denly he heard the buzzing again. He couldn’t waste any more time. 

Fishing in his pocket, he found his pocket knife, yanked out his shirt-tail 
and nicked it, tore it off. Kneeling before the bank of switches, he laid the 
emerald in the middle of the rag, folded it over, twisted it tightly and 
bound it to his forehead as he rose again. 

He flinched from the sudden babble of voices that assaulted his mind. 
They screamed, wailed, entreated. His interior receptors, unfolding like the 
petals of a terrible flower, were picking up the mad yammering of human 
creatures. Oh, god, there were others alive in this place. Looking closer, 
despite the horror, he found that he was listening to the amplified, disem- 
bodied mind-voices of the biocomputers, the enslaved brains of the humans 
that powered the alien’s ships. 

Nausea threatened to overwhelm him. No, he wouldn’t look at it any 
more. There was nothing he could do for whatever disembodied wretches 
had ended their lives like this. If they were ever to be free, if he and Sara 
were to be free, he would have to go on, do whatever it was that he had to 
do.. He jerked the probing sensors of his mind back to the inner chamber, 
reached out to touch Sara. 

A low, almost musical tone emanated from her, interrupted with discor- 
dant bursts of inner conflict. As he fought to free their bodies, Sara fought 
herself. Shaken out of her lethargy by the terror of their experience, she 
was recalling what she had been, what they had been. Trying to direct her

woman’s strength outward to him, to overcome her fear. And making it, 
though she was still frightened. But not for his physical safety any longer. 
Just frightened, and that was natural. Her interior tone grew stronger, and 
he set himself to match it, discovered in himself a harmonic, as though 
they hummed a chord, part of a chord, on two notes. Then a third note 
could be heard, supplying a basso completion so profound and completely 
satisfying that Dave began to lose himself in it. 

— Please — don’t linger. They come! — 

It was the priest. Dave shook himself, reached out a hand and placed it 
flat on the third switchplate from the left. Its light came up as the crystal’s 
had. He pushed it twice, and the white light decayed to green. He did the 
same with two other plates, placed his right hand, palm down, in an open- 
ing above and behind the bank of switches, and felt a tingle. 

This done, he turned and went back around to the front of the crystal. 
The steps were before him. He swallowed hard, and put his right foot on 
the first. 

I don’t have any right to be here, no right at all. I’m just a lousy small- 
time pilot on a dangerous, illegal flight to nowhere. Dangerous to myself 
and Sara, and harmful to that stupid Bonnie, who’d probably have found 
some other poor idiot to fly her on this Job if I hadn’t, but that’s not my 
business, is it? I went for it, went for an easy out to a problem / let hap- 
pen myself. I’m not worthy to put my feet on these steps. I’m defiling them 
with every step I take. My mere presence darkens the purity of the crystal, 
pollutes the Holy of Holies. 

I’m so tired. I want to sleep . 

My foot comes up to the next step. It burns. 

Hot, I used to get so hot with the unfairness of what was happening to 
us that I wanted Danny to die and have it over with. I wanted to hit Sara, 
to get her to quit looking like a martyr, make her yell, or cry, or some- 
thing. Anything to be doing something about it, anything, make some ges- 
ture in the face of the unfairness. Who asked for this — the kid we both 
loved, the life we’d made, destroyed? I used to get so hot about a lot of 
things: the war, the pollution, the cops, the users of the good things, the 
wasters. But I couldn’t get anyone to see it, help me do something. Sara, 
sitting by Danny’s bed all the time, reading him stories, lifting him, bath- 
ing him. I couldn’t handle even seeing him, tried to get her out of there 
and get involved in something we could change. But she couldn’t get in- 
terested in it. Didn’t want to hear about anything outside the house and 
Danny. Wanted to talk about Danny, about us, about me, about her. Little 
things, trivia! I wanted to do something big to make it better. But I’m all 
bogged down in this petty day-to-day bullshit that won’t make a goddamn 
bit of difference in a thousand years. Or will it? 

I take another step, like trying to swim upward in a pool of syrup, 
heavy, dragging at me. 

I’ve said that a million times, haven’t I? A thousand years? This has 
been going on for ten thousand years, and it still makes a difference, be-

cause it happens to us, happens to people, individual people. We have to 
live with it, each of us. Have to sweep up our own crap. And / haven’t 
swept up mine, all the small, but significant details of my personality, the 
Dave Game. An accusing, self-pitying crock of crap. That's all / did, all I 
accomplished while telling myself how trapped I was by a sick kid and a 
martyred wife, I who had seen the building blocks of the universe in liv- 
ing color and knew just where it was at better than anyone else except for 
Sara, who was Shakti, and didn’t have to know, but was It. 

Another step. Someone bled here. Someone fell here, trying to get where 
I’m going. Someone turned and ran screaming out of here rather than face 
all this. But there’s no escape, no way out of this. Wouldn’t matter if I did 
run. Tm a hopeless mess. We’re all hopeless. Me, him, her. All ridiculous 
and small and mean. We deserve to die in sight of the top. Deserve it. 

Have to die, because who could hope to be clean enough to use the 
power of the crystal, use that sacred energy in the shape we’re in. Man 
shape, earth shape. I can’t take this clumsy, cruddy piece of meat machin- 
ery with me up there, this Daveness, this darkness. 

Oh, Sara, honey, Tm sorry. Sorry I was so blind and petty and small. 
You were right. All those feelings I was too proud to feel. Disappointment 
and pain and anger and fear. Kept it locked up inside me till it rotted me, 
killed all the loving in me and turned it into bitterness. Locked me up in 
this figuring machine, this calculator. 

One more step. 

Tm so tired. I’m ready to die. I can’t think of any other way to get free 
of all the shit I am. Death . 

So hard to keep moving. So hard to put one foot in front of the other. I 
know which Bardo this is, alright. And I can’t fight it. Can’t go on. Drag- 
ging, pulling, heaviness. 

Step. There’s the light above me . seen that before. I might Just be 
able to die for all of them, if I can’t live for them. Got to get close enough 
to the light to burn all this sick heaviness out of me, this ugliness, this 
mindtrapped Daveness. Monsters down there. Monster up here. I'm the 
monster, and I carry the monstrosity with me, it oozes out my pores, out of 
my head, my body, and I see it take on a twisted form of its own, but still 
me, blocking the way to the light with my soiled humanness. 

Step. It’s standing there, all teeth and claws arul hair and fangs. Menac- 
ing, threatening. Like something out of a comic book, and me still down 
there climbing, pitiful. Well, kill me if you can, creature, but I’m still 
going to keep on coming till you kill, keep on trying to get to the light. 

I raise my impossibly heavy foot to the last step, push at it with my 
leaden hands, try to brush it aside, this tulpa of mine. 

It dissolves like mist in the sun. And I hear faint laughter. 

High up here. High and pure, a crystal protrusion into the material 
world, pulling down light arid energy from some etheric otherness to en- 
soul and vivify the land, and with it the world. As I turn, the floor of the 
inner chamber looks miles away down there, as though I stood at Mt. 



BENEATH THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE

Meru and saw the whole world below me, worshipping, coming to pos- 
tulate and wash their bodies in the energy. Only there's just Sara down 
there, sitting so bravely and quietly in the lesser priest's chair. You'd 
never know she was scared. You'd never know that I was, up here at the 
top of that Jacob's Ladder of a stairway. And I never got to wrestle with 
the Thing. It was really me, anyway. 

But those things outside . they're not me. They're not part of the 
Greater Harmony. They come from someplace else, some planet where life 
is cheap, other creatures lives trivial. Well, they'll get my head, but not 
the way they ‘think. My head ... a tuning fork of a thing on its fragile 
stalk of neck ... I brought it here to the Seat of Power to offer for use. 
You hear that, Arien? Tm here, and hey, / even know the right words to 
say. 

I desire to know in order to serve. 

Redd that somewhere , and a good thing, too. 

But I don't suppose it matters. Attitude, that's what counts up here, not 
words. And this is our planet, our learning. These others, now, they're not 
supposed to be here, no matter what poor schleps need to get into the True 
Believer bit about flying saucers. / have to cut off their supply lines that 
are tapped into the energy and send them back where they belong. Have to 
relax, tune into it, get above and outside Dave Connell who's feeling 
scared, looking at the creatures, and just serve. Do the thing. 

I sit in the high, carven seat. The walls of light close around me and 
seem to thrum, very low, a mantra to soothe me, soothe Dave down arul to 
sleep. The work is to do, and nobody needs ole Dave. Go to sleep, sucker. 
Just cool it. Listen to the pretty music and dream good dreams. 

Perfection! The rruiterial object that sits on the body of the earth, living 
geometry, effortless, flowing. I follow it down, to its base where the fun- 
dament of the crystal joins its roots to the earth, arul deeper, splitting into 
the conscious reality of paradox, the growth of the material crystal from 
the material earth-and the connection into a scintillant dimension of un- 
formed energy. It bleeds, no, it breathes, it spills, through this medium, 
energy out onto the material level. Dave is not quite asleep. He dreams, 
and tries to fit words to all this. A waste of my time. 

Ah, here's the Harmonic of Delta sleep. I reach out to it, activate it, 
and switch him off. 

Harmonics. A place for everything, arul everything singing. And Tm at 
the center, the critical connection. The only moving part. I could beat 
cosmic time with my fingers. If I had fingers. But I’ve got something bet- 
ter. I beat time with long, long exhalations, inhalations of energy. 

But there's a drain somewhere. Time, energy, relentlessly slipping 
away, leaking out through some crack in the outer surface of my reality. 
One big leak. 

Right there. 

Focus just right, and I can see the whole cancerous installation of the 
Invaders, surrounding me on two sides. It's connected to me, rooted in my 



152 



GAIAXY 




pyramid-body, sucking up the flow of energy and using it to — 

— Just so. The breach must be healed. Disconnect the brains they have 
used to tap into the Stone. Seal them off . — 

Wait a minute. They’re big, so intricately locked into the flow that it’ll 
take attention and time to cut them off without damaging the crystal. I 
slide my awareness down the pulsating surface of the energy field to the 
tap-in, arui it’s so huge, so bloodily pouring energy into the creature’s 
machinery that it’ll take major surgery to fix it. Carefiil. 

— Seal it ! — 

But / know as my mirul threads its way down into the hungry gush of 
energy through into the alien’s quarters that there is no doing this quickly. 
To hurry is to chance damaging the ancient, holy thing. 

— Hurry ! — 

Wait just a damn minute! If I go too fast and jiggle the crystal’s integ- 
rity, I’ll blow this piece of the Atlantic into the upper atmosphere. It’ll rain 
crystal in Boston, and lord knows where else. 

Let’s look this system over and see what has to be done. I want out of 
here. Dave wants out. Bodies are fragile, and I’m pretty fond of mine. 
Sara’s too. So don’t rush me. 

I have to take a look at this. Now, if the alien’s quarters are hooked in 
on two sides of the pyramid, and I cut it off here, the feedback from the 
force-block will give me an overload in sections three through seven. I’ll 
have to cut down the flow gradually to Beta level and at that level the field 
can hold it and not be shaken apart by feedback. 

The ebbing energy slows with a dopplering whine like worn-out brakes, 
and I think it's not supposed to make that twise as I slowly rujrrow the 
field. But I go ahead. I focus my awareness and it's like looking through a 
glass onion — the superimposed vibratory rates — as I reduce the level still 
further, apply the tourniquet of my mind to the wound in the crystal’s field. 
I see them running around in a frenzy over there, dashing for the control 
complex. 

Oh-oh. Might have known they’d fight. Six of them standing at the con- 
trol console, disciplined, machine-like. With one shouting orders. He 
doesn’t know what’s cutting off their energy, but he’s going to stop it if he 
can. He increases — with the busy, boneless fingers of his underlings, and I 
decrease — with the disembodied 360 degree input of my awareness, 
focused through the crystal. I hear a high whine as we struggle, a sound 
that I know is wrong. I follow it, let its wrongness draw me close enough 
to observe, and — 

Overload ! 



VII 

In an instant I see raw, ravening energy, too powerfully drawn from the 
complex interior workings of the crystal’s energy field. I know where I am, 
arui what I’m doing, but I seem to be seeing beyond time. Ten thousand 

BENEATH THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE 153 




years of technology stretches backward out of my conscious awareness and 
the shrieking overload exparuis, contracts, expands again, shaking the very 
earth. It thrums in the bowels of the continent. Glass shatters, building 
stones crumble and smash on the paving blocks of the outer courtyard. The 
Twelve's concentration wavers, and they break, leap from their seats and 
run from the inner chamber in terror, charge bliruily through the halls, 
forgetting their task. They strike down the waiting supplicants, who wail to 
them to stop the vibration that is shaking the earth apart. 

But nothing can save them, the Twelve or their people. In the outer air, 
the very atmosphere is electric with terror. Lightning strikes from a clear 
sky, the earth quakes relentlessly, the overloaded crystal keens its knell. 

Escape! I have to get us out of here. 

Dave jumped to his feet, slipping on the polished floor. Flinging out a 
hand to catch himself, he touched the substance of the crystal, felt the vi- 
bration through the glasslike walls. He ran down the stairs, feeling the vi- 
bration even through the soles of his shoes. He grabbed the white faced 
Sara, Jerked her to her feet, and they ran. 

There was no buzzing, humming warning of aliens. Evidently they were 
all engaged in the struggle with their energy systems. Dave and Sara fled 
panting back the way they had come, Dave leading, searching out the path 
with a part of his mind that he knew was altered forever. 

He cast his awareness out, and could see, even touch, the controls of the 
force-bubble that had brought them down, englobed them in energy and 
carried them to the undersea hangar. Through the pain of a stitch in his 
side, he reached out, tried to touch the controls, and gave a gasping laugh 
when he felt them respond. 

Here was the right door. They ran through it, leaving it open. 

In the flickering light, they could see the plane where it rocked in the 
shallows, the gangway scraping in the wash of sudden waves. 

They pounded up the gangway. No reason to be quiet now. The note of 
vibration was rising, rising, and a new sound interposed itself, a rhythmic 
thump, that raised waves and sent them crashing onto the narrow beach. 
Dave kicked the gangway aside, closed and dogged the door. They 
dropped into their seats. 

Dave hit the ignition, and it caught. His eyes went to the control panel, 
swept it, forgot it. All systems were abnormal, but there was no time to do 
anything about them. He reached out with his mind, activated the force 
field, which closed in around the plane. They began to go forward. 

A section of the far wall seemed to thin and dissolve as they skimmed 
toward it. He heard himself gulp as it happened, stupidly; he was doing 
this himself. The tropical shimmer of ocean water danced and flickered be- 
fore the speeding plane, but he saw it through several layers of ill-matched 
glass. He choked on a sound that might have been a laugh or a sob as the 
suspended plane passed through the arching wall and they found them- 
selves surrounded by the blue dance of mobile ocean. 

The plane rose too slowly in the bubble field, like a spent breath from 

154 GALAXY 




some bottom-dwelling monster. There was no sound fron the engine, and 
none from the force- field that enclosed them. Dave imagined he could feel 
a tremble of vibration, but told himself it was in his mind. That they still 
had time. 

The plane hung in watery space far above the submerged pyramid, ris- 
ing, rising. The illusion of vibration grew as they rose, and shuddered on 
the edge of sound. As he jjeered forward through the windscreen, the nose 
again glowed with the same halo of blue light he had seen before they fell. 

Suddenly, pain struck him, and he could hear quite clearly the rising 
pitch of the over-burdened, too-taxed crystal. Like some tortured thing, it 
screamed its protest into his shrinking ears, fear-sweat was icy on his skin 
as he looked frantically upward, calculating the distance to the surface. It 
hung above the plane like a roof, growing closer. 

Then they were through it. The plane rose into the air, climbing. The 
engines, silent since Dave had switched on the field, were still, uimaturally 
silent. Minute vortices of energy spun on the interface of the field, obscur- 
ing their view of the open sky. But it was sky. Real sky! 

Head pounding with the shrilling of the overloaded crystal, Dave looked 
down, and saw a strange radiating pattern of milky lines on the surface. 
These converged on a central point, multiplied and began to spin, bulging 
upward in the center like an eye. 

Speechless, he heard the engine sputter to life, catch, and begin to roar. 
He gaped at the instruments, tearing his eyes away from the up-rushing 
maelstrom of ocean below, and pulled the nose up. The plane climbed, 
away from the boiling sea. 

The radio crackled and spoke. “What the hell was that?” a man’s voice 
shouted tinnily. 

“No data,” replied another voice. “No dat — ” “My God, look down 
there! You seeing what I’m seeing. Bob? Looks like the bottom of the 
ocean exploded!” 

“Hey Lauderdale! Come in, Lauderdale! Come in Tower! I think a 
bomb exploded down there ! ’ ’ 

“Here comes the wave,” the radio reported. Dave could see the racing 
curve of it, shock-propelled, as it passed under them. The radio screamed 
with a confusion of voices from craft on the surface. Some were silenced 
as the wave hit them. But it seemed to Dave that he could still hear them. 

The emerald burned on his forehead. He could feel Sara’s pity as each 
new report, each new SOS came through, feel the dying, the terror, as the 
tsunami smashed toward the land. He put up a hand to the emerald. 

There were no more aliens in the undersea installation. Water, unlike the 
first time, swept through the inner chamber of the crystal. It was sunk, 
perhaps forever this time. Washed clean. 

As the emerald could wash minds clean, bodies clean from disease and 
pain. As it could heal, he discovered with wonder, probing the pos- 
sibilities. Sara took his hand, and he reached out his mind to calm the fear 
in her, wash it -away with emerald light. She smiled, tears on her face.

Ahead there would be work to do, more work than he had ever under- 
taken in his life. He’d have no time for the meaningless chatter of cocktail 
parties, no energy to waste on trying to turn Sara into something other than 
she was. She was alright. He was alright. 

But that was fine. It had to be. 

He was going to be very busy from now on. 

There was no way out of it. — JANE GALLION

GALAXY 




STATEMENT OF POLICY 

Welcome to the new GALAXY. 

As you can see from our first issue 
there ’ve been some changes made. 
And there is more coming. 

Science fiction itself has been 
changing the last few years. 

The number of science fiction 
books and movies being released has 
increased dramatically. 

Hundreds of science fiction books 
are scheduled for release in the next 
twelve months alone. 

You’ll find a probing series of in- 
terviews with the stars and directors 
responsible for some of today’s new 
science fiction movies, and behind the 
scenes articles on how these movies 
are made, as well as conversations 
with luminaries in the fields of science 
and literature. 

The new GALAXY will help keep 
you abreast of all this every issue with 
news of forthcoming projects in both 
media from our SF Hotline corres- 
pondents. 

The increasing rate of change in our 
lives, the result of industrialization, 
has focused people’s attention on the 



scientific horizon which may effect us 
all. 

You’ll find this interest reflected in 
more articles we will be developing, 
rounding-up current breakthroughs in 
chemistry, biology and physics, by 
science writer Greg Chalfin, as well as 
reports on similiar breakthroughs in 
the scientific investigation of psychic 
phenomenon by former NASA en- 
gineer, Jim Be^. 

Also coming in the escape world of 
fantasy is a new series of illustrated 
graphic stories with scripts by some of 
the biggest names in science fiction 
and artwork by some of the finest 
artists in the comic field. 

Plus you’ll find the same exciting 
blend of award winning science fic- 
tion by your favorites that GALAXY 
has always been famous for. 

All in all you’ll find the kind of 
magazine modem science fiction 
readers have been asking for. 

So join us every issue as 
GALAXY, the magazine of the fu- 
ture, steps into the future. 

GALAXY, the 21st Century sci- 
ence fiction magazine.

How The 

Science Fiction Book Club Works: 

When your application for membership is accepted, 
you’ll receive your introductory package of four 
books for just 10^. plus shipping and handling. You 
may examine them in your home, and if not com- 
pletely satisfied, return them within ten days— mem- 
bership will be cancelled and you’ll owe nothing. 

About every 4 weeks (14 times a year), we’ll send 
you the Club’s bulletin, Things to Come, describing 
the 2 coming Selections and a variety of Alternate 
choices. If you want both Selections, you need do 
nothing; they’ll be shipped automatically.
