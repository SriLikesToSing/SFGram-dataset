The paper time machine 

STRATEGY 4 TACTICS is a magazine. It s 
also a tool: a time machine that enables you 
to replay the crucial events — past, present, 
and future -that shape our lives. 

Now, instead of merely reading about what's 
happening, you can explore and experience 
the alternatives and decision points through 
the technique of Conflict Simulation. 

What ia Conflict Simulation? 

Conflict Simulation is a way of analyzing a 
political or military conflict situation. A way 
that is as intellectually stimulating as a game 
of chess, and as thorough as ai written analysis. 

Through the use of the Conflict Simulation 
(or "game") format, the conflict situation is 
re-created — so that you are in a position to 
make the vital decisions and, in the game at 
least, change the way things were, are, or 
will be. 

What you gat 

STRATEGY 4 TACTICS magazine is publish- 
ed bi-monthly. Each issue contains: 

★ A ready-to-play conflict-simulation game 
with a 22 x 28" playing surface, die-cut play- 



ing pieces, and complete rules. 

* An analytical article on the same subiect as 
the game in that issue. 

* Other feature articles on historical and 
military subjects. 

* Game and book reviews, commentary on 
existing games, and discussions of subscribers' 
questions. 

The magazine is 48 + pages long, and all 
material is handled in a highly organized (and 
easily understandable) graphic format. 

Games recently published in STRATEGY 4 
TACTICS were: GRUNT (ground combat in 
Vietnam), LOST BATTLES (tactical combat in 
Russia, 1941-44), USN (the war in the Pacific 
1941-43). COMBAT COMMAND (tactical com- 
bat in Western Europe, 1944). 

We also publish a separate line of conflict- 
simulation games, which you will find listed in 
the coupon.

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

About Stephen Tail's Gods on 
Olympus: It is a pleasant, readable tale 
because 4 'it is odd , exciting and it has a 
climax" (G. K. Chesterton, Science 
and the Savages). The style is, if 
anything, soony, which means senti- 
mental in Australian Jargon. 

To compensate, there are zing 
sentences terminating many para- 
graphs, which serve also as boundary 
markers. There is not much literary 
piling- Pelion-on- Ossa. 

As to the structure, it is somewhat of 
a bundle of themes tied together only 
by their simultaneous existence in print. 
It is half science (vide mfra) and half 
fantasy, fused mainly by the per- 
sonality of the I-narrator and his lovely 
spouse, with wizened Ursula serving as 
artistic oracle. The endihg is more of a 
half-cadence than a climax, being saved 
only by the intervention of a deus ex 
machina in the form of a hands-off 
ukase. 

It is scientifically unacceptable , at 
least by the criteria of today's bio- 
logical paradigm. There is no evidence 
of evolution and only the imperial mute 
coon and his mate as evidence of of mu- 
tation or speciation. Moreover, it is le- 
gitimate to ask or\ what fauna the 
eagles generally fed. And finally, the 
small coon hands and the eagles 
together could not surmount the 
physical difficulty of such major 
construction as is described . 



Despite the carping criticism, an en- 
joyable piece. 

In the Reading Room Lester del Rey 
admits an attack of la maladie sans ma- 
ladie and with poignant nostalgia calls 
to mind that era in which sf was a way 
of life, or if not that, then primarily a 
happy hobby for all participants. He 
pensively regrets the present demand 
for relevance and that urge to save the 
world for humanity even in the smallest 
activity. It is certain that both he and sf 
will find some pleasant nostrum for this 
ailment. 

This is not only a get-well-real-quick 
message, but has also the intent of 
noting that he gives to sf a purpose. 
Now Judith M. Hochberg strictly 
denies that sf has a purpose ( Directions, 
Galaxy, Sept. 4 72). People have pur- 
poses but genres do not. Let us not in- 
dulge in semantics, but rather synec- 
doche. Ms. Hochberg advocates sf that 
penetrates psyche, theology , social jus- 
tice, humanitarianism (local, global 
and galactic) as well as other minute 
and great elements of life. Mr. del Rey 
wants carefully thought out, jolly good 
fun. She is more serious than he; he is 
the recessive component and she the 
progressive component in this scientific 
mythography. 

A just apodosis is that we must have 
more than one sort of sf tale. 

Alexander Doniphan Wallace

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

One of the clearest definitions of sf 
appeared in Lester del Rey's Reading 
Room in August If. He put forward 
three criteria for judging whether some- 
thing is sf or not: 1 ) Rationality, 2) Fic- 
tion, 3) Alternative. He distinguishes

T HE meeting and the funeral 
had both run long and Ben 
Charles Pertin was late. Because of 
this and because what he was late 
for was a date with the girl he loved 
and hoped to marry he was trying 
to make up time. 

On Sun One trying to hurry was 
both easy and unwise. The easy part 
was physical. Sun One’s gravity ran 
about three per cent of Earth’s even 
at the center, so you could leap 
thirty yards at a time on the 
straightaway and never bother with 
stairs or elevators in going from 
shell to shell of the great sphere. 
The unwise part lay in the fact that 
most of Sun One’s population, 
composed of fifty strange races 
from all over the galaxy, was also in 
a hurry — you ran the risk of 
collision all the time. Humanity 
was a junior race in the galaxy. 
Pertin’s instructions had been most 
explicit about avoiding offense 
when possible. 

He was also in a difficult mood 
because of the combined impact of 
the morning’s events. The funeral 
had been his boss’s, Ray Sam 
Barnett’s. Pertin had liked him only 
generally and defensively — there 
had been no close personal tie. 
Nevertheless, Sam’s death had 
been an unwelcome reopening of 
ancient insomniac questions having 
to do with what death really 
amounted to under the special cir- 
cumstances of Sun One. As Pertin 



7 



hurried down from the shell where 
Barnett's shrouded body had been 
consigned to the matter banks of 
the tachyon transmitters he found 
the old puzzle of identity clouding 
his mind. 

Sun One had begun as an as- 
teroid circling a young blue-white 
giant star in the great diffuse gas 
cloud that Earthly astronomers 
called the Orion Nebula. Over a pe- 
riod of centuries it had been built 
upon, sheathed over and tunneled 
into until it had been converted into 
a great hivelike artifact. It was the 
closest thing there was to a central 
headquarters of the loose associa- 
tion of intelligent races in the 
galaxy which had made contact 
with each other. Ben Pertin and all 
the other forty or fifty human 
beings there were newcomers to 
Sun One and to the galactic confra- 
ternity — Earth was the newest 
planet to .achieve contact. When a 
Sirian or a TWorlie died half of 
Sun One was likely to come out to 
do him honor. At the funeral of 
Pertin’s boss the only mourners — if 
“mourners” was the right term — 
had been a handful of humans and 
not more than six representatives of 
all other known sentients. Not 
even all the humans had troubled 
to show up — probably, Pertin 
thought, because they did not want 
to stimulate, again that endless 
questioning about who it was who 
had died, when the nature of 
tachyon travel meant that exact du- 
plicates of Pertin’s boss still lived at 



a dozen places in the galaxy. As 
they did for everyone on Sun One, 
since each of them had come there 
in the same way. 

N evertheless the death 

did have some concrete im- 
plications and one of them touched 
Pertin very closely. That had been 
the subject of the brief staff meeting 
that followed the funeral. 

The most unpleasant part was yet 
to come — Pertin had to tell his 
fiancee about the results of the 
meeting. She was sure to dislike it. 
Still, as he came closer to where she 
was waiting for him the unpleasant, 
aspects began to fade from his mind 
and he began to feel the joy of 
seeing. Zara Doy again. Bisexual 
love, it had turned out; was not very 
common in the galaxy, most, of 
whose races either reproduced in 
impersonal ways or reserved their 
emotional commitments for func- 
tions other than procreation. But^ 
Pertin and Zara Doy were deeply in 
love all the same. They planned to 
marry as soon as they could and 
rather enjoyed the fact that this- 
made them objects of interest to 
such beings as possessed personal 
curiosity at all. 

So they were watched as Pertin< 
spotted Zara Doy and launched 
himself toward her in a shallow 
gravity dive over the heads of a 
thing like a dragon, a creature com- 
posed mostly of a single great. blue 
eye and a couple of scurrying 
collective creatures from one of the

core stars. “Sorry,” he cried down 
at them, caught the laughing girl’s 
hand and stopped hard beside her. , 

“Ouch,” she said, releasing a 
holdfast with her other hand. “I’d 
appreciate a little less enthusiasm 
next time.” 

He kissed her and took her arm. 
“It’s part of the image,” he said 
cheerfully. “You know what the 
chief of delegation says. Make 
them know we’re here. Earth may 
be the newest planet in the associa- 
tion but it isn’t going to be the least 
important. We have a duty to Earth 
to make ourselves known 
throughout the galaxy and a duty to 
the galaxy to contribute our 
strength and our know-how.” 

“I think,” said the girl, “that if 
you’re going to talk like that you’d 
better buy me a drink.” 

At this shell of Sun One the cur- 
vature of the spherical surface they 
walked on was noticeably sharp. It 
was easier to leap than to stroll. To 
travel arm in arm, which is how 
Ben Charles Pertin chose to walk 
with his girl, required practice and 
a lot of discomfort, not only to 
them but to the other sentients in 
the concourse. Pertin and Zara 
shifted grips, so that each had an 
arm around the other’s waist— then 
Pertin caught the holdfast webbing 
with his free hand and partly tug- 
ged, partly kicked them into the air. 
They shot past the dragonlike 
creature, narrowly missed a 
steelwork vertical strut, touched 
down again next to something that 



looked like a soft-bodied beetle 
with three dozen legs and were in 
sight of the little refreshment plat- 
form they liked. Pertin said “Hi!” 
to a thing like a green bat as it flap- 
ped by. It hissed something shrill 
that his personal translator 
repeated into his ear as, “I recog- 
nize your identity, Ben Charles 
Pertin.” The girl nodded, too, al- 
though all members of that par- 
ticular race, which was called the 
T’ Worlie, looked alike to her, and 
in any event the T’Worlie did not 
have the custom of nodding since 
they had no more neck than bats. 

As they waited for traffic to clear 
Zara asked, “How did things go 
this morning?” 

He hesitated, then said, “About 
as usual. Things are all fouled up on 
the probe.” He was watching a 
tumbling boxlike robot coming 
toward them on a tangent, cor- 
recting its course with methodical 
jets of steam from the faces of its 
cubical body, but the tone of his 
voice made the girl look at him 
sharply. 

“What is it, Ben?” . 

“I’ll tell you when we sit down.” 

“You’ll tell me now.” 

“Well—” He hesitated, then 
cried. “All right, we can make it 
now!” But the girl wrapped her fin- 
gers around the webbing of the 
holdfast. 

“Ben!” 

He relaxed and looked at her. He 
didn’t say anything, but he didn’t 
have to.

“Ben! Not again!” 

He said defensively, “I have to, 
Zara. The other copy of me is 
dying. Barnett promised he’d go 
instead of me — because of how you 
feel — but now he’s dead here. 
There’s nobody from Earth on the 
probe now to represent us. So I 
agreed to carry the ball.” He gazed 
appraisingly at the traffic of aliens f 
then back at her — and frowned in 
sharp surprise. 

Zara seemed close to crying. He 
said, “What are you making a big 
thing about? It’s nothing we haven’t 
done before.” 

“I know,” she said and blinked 
hard. “It’s only — well, it’s sort of 
silly. It’s just that 1 hate the idea of 
your dying out there while we’re on 
our honeymoon.” 

Pertin was touched. He patted 
the girl’s hand and said seriously. 
“Honey, one of the traits I like best 
in you is that you’re ndi afraid to be 
sentimental at the right time. Don’t 
knock it. I love you for it. Now let’s 
go get that drink.” 



T 'HE little cafe was nearly 
empty. That was one of the 
things they liked about it. It had 
actual waiters — Purchased People; 
they didn’t have much personality 
to display, but they were actually 
human, genetically speaking — and 
Pertin and his fianede enjoyed 
ordering in their rudimentary 
Italian. It was not their own lan- 
guage, to be sure, but at least it was 



one for which they did not need the 
Pmal translators. 

Pertin pulled his feet up, crossed 
them in air and settled gently onto 
his chair. They looked about while 
waiting for their drinks to be 
brought. Pertin had been on Sun 
One for more than two years now, 
the girl for several months. Even so, 
familiarity had not dulled their 
interest in the place. Zara was a 
newscaster, broadcasting to Earth 
every week on the stereo stage. 
Pertin was an engineer. His job on 
Sun One didn’t involve much 
engineering. It did involve an 
interesting mixture of skills — he 
functioned partly as a legalized spy, 
partly as a goodwill ambassador 
from Earth to the rest- of the 
universe. 

The mere fact that a job like his 
existed was still secretly thrilling to 
Ben Charles Pertin. He was old 
enough to remember the time when 
humans had thought themselves 
alone in the galaxy. The old “na- 
tions” had put up their chemical 
rockets and sent them chugging to 
Venus, Mars and the moon in his 
grandfather’s time. They had 
looked for life and come up empty 
every time. Nuclear probes, ' a 
generation later, had investigated 
the outer planets, the satellites and 
even the asteroids with the same 
result. No life. By the time Ben had 
been twelve the juice had run out of 
space travel. - 

Contact had come as Ben Pertin 
was turning thirteen. Something 



10 



IF 




had been found on Pluto — an ar- 
tifact, half-buried under Pluto’s 
mirror of ice — and Earth had sud- 
denly looked outward again. The 
stereo stages had been full of the 
Find, of the First fumbling attempts 
to patch it together, the First daring 
experiment at putting power 
through it. Everybody had talked 
about it. Ben and his parents had 
watched the glowing figure on their 
stage, enthralled. The kids in 
school had made it the main subject 
of every class. 

And when the ancient communi- 
cator had come to life and the First 
alien face had peered out of its 
screen and looked into the face of a 
human. Earth had gone mad. 



«T DON’T want to hear any 
A more of that cockamamie 
Earthman’s Burden talk,” said 
Zara Doy, “I heard too much of it 
when I was a kid. I don’t want you 
going out to die. Stay here with 
me.” 

Pertin said fondly, “You’re 
sweet, Zara. But this is important. 
The situation on the probe is 
exploding — the beings are Fighting. 
They’re dying uselessly. I can’t 
back out just for some sentimental 
idea of — ” 

“Sentiment be damned! Look. 
When we get married I want you 
right in bed with me — all of you. I 
don’t want to be thinking about 
part of you dying way off in 
nowhere.”

“I’ll be with you, honey. All of 
me.” 

“You know what I mean,” she 
said angrily. 

He hesitated. The last thing he 
wanted was to quarrel with his 
fiancee two days before they were 
to get married. He rubbed his troth 
ring and said, “Zara, I have to go 
to the probe. First, I said I would 
and the boss has passed the word to 
all the other top brass on Sun One. 
Second, it's important. It’s not 
‘Earthman’s Burden.’ It’s simple 
logic. We’re new and pretty far be- 
hind, compared to the Scorpians or 
the methane crowd or the T’ Worlie. 
But look at what we’ve done al-

everything that’s happening. The 
others are getting used to us. They

“I don’t care.” 

“It’s not as if I haven’t done it 
before — ” 

“The other time you went we 
weren’t about to be married.” 

“All right, that’s true. 1 owe you 
something. But I owe our planet 
something, too. We’re just begin- 
ning to contribute our share of 
leadership in the galaxy, Zara. I 
mean, look at that waiter. Half the 
Purchased People around are now 
human - beings. When the 
nonviables edit a copy for Sun 
One — what shape do they copy? 



Human! The human shape is as fa- 
miliar in the galaxy now as the She- 
liaks — and all less than in twenty 
years.” 

Zara sucked at the last of her 
drink and put it down in its cage. 
She stared at the waiter, who was 
smoking a cigarette and thinking 
whatever thoughts a blanked-out 
personality was allowed to think. 

She shook her head. “I’ll lay it 
out nice and orderly like an 
engineer for you, Ben. First, if they 
copy human shape — is it because 
they respect us or because they have 
some crazy methane sense of 
humor? Second, if they buy our 
convicts for Purchased People, 
likely enough it’s because we have 
more criminals to sell. Third, I 
don’t like the whole idea of Earth’s 
trying to dominate the galaxy. 
Fourth — ” 

“Dominate? I said ‘leadership,’ 
not domination.” 

“One is a prerequisite to the 
other. Fourth, I hate your going on 
personal grounds — and I’m not 
talking about idealism. I’m talking 
about sex. It’s going to take some 
of the joy out of going to bed with 
you, Ben, thinking that at the same 
time somewhere else you’re getting 
eaten by a Sheliak or dying of 
radiation burn. I’m sorry it’s so, 
but it’s so.” 

Ben said doubtfully after a 
moment, “Would it be better if we 
postponed the wedding a little bit?” 

“I don’t know. Let me think.” 

He waited, finished his drink,

looked cautiously at Zara. He saw 
no anger or misery on her pretty 
face — she was simply staring 
thoughtfully out at the other beings 
in the concourse. 

Pertin beckoned to the waiter and 
paid the check. 

“They thank you,” said the 
waiter in the idiom of the 
Purchased People, staring ap- 
praisingly at Pertin and the girl. As 
with all Earth’s exported criminals, 
his body and will belonged to the 
race that had bought him, but the 
thoughts of the brain inside were 
still his own. Far off at the core of 
some gas-giant planet or floating in 
space, a- creature with a wholly dif- 
ferent physical structure was using 
this man’s eyes and limbs as his 
own, linked by tachyon trans- 
mission to the monitor units im- 
planted in each Purchased Person’s 
skull. But inside that skull the 
original mind was spending a 
lifetime in solitary confinement. 
“They ask,” droned the waiter, “if 
there will be anything else?” 

“No, we’re going-” 

Zara sighed and smiled at Pertin. 
“Well — you want to go pretty 
badly. Feeling the way you do, I 
suppose you ought to go. I won’t 
stop you, Ben, and it’s silly to put 
off getting married. But there is one 
thing I want you to do.” He waited 
warily. “Give me your ring. No, 
just to hold. When you’ve finished 
going to the probe I’ll give it back 
to you. But I don’t want you 
wearing my ring when you die.” 



I AST-MINUTE briefing was in 
* the tachyon transport cham- 
ber, out at the far shell of Sun One 
and heavily shielded. Dr. Gerald 
York Bielowitz himself checked out 
Pertin. He was a methodical man, 
one of the reasons he was head of 
the mission to Sun One. He read 
from a soundscripted list. 

“We’ve got about ten minutes, 
Ben Charles. Let’s see. Object 
Lambda. You know as much about 
it as I do. It’s anomalous and it’s 
exciting. The only way to find out 
about it is this probe and it’s in 
Earth’s interest to make the probe 
succeed.” He dropped hjs eyes to 
the page and went on: “There’s no 
possibility of survival on the probe, 
of course, and this has undoubtedly 
had some effect on the psyches of 
all the beings there. To the extent 
that they have what we can map as 
psyches, I mean. But in my opinion 
it’s the physical problems that have 
caused the trouble. Some of them 
are now dying — your predecessor 
among them, of course. Others are 
functioning poorly, probably be- 
cause of ionization interference 
with their nervous systems. Or 
whatever corresponds to nervous 
systems. At any rate — ” he checked 
• off a point — “the beings aboard no 
longer constitute an orderly system. 
There’s violence. Some of the 
deaths are from fights or murders. 
This is seriously interfering with the 
operation of the probe and 



DOOMSHIP 



13 




threatening its very success. You 
know how important that is. If we 
blow this it’ll be more than a 
hundred years before we get 
another chance. And finally — ” 
Bielowitz folded the list and put it 
in his sporran — “your account here 
will be credited with double-rate 
pay for your services on the probe. 
Your equipment will follow, along 
with Doc Chimp here.” He nodded 
civilly to the hairy little handyman 
who crouched next to Pert in. “And 
good luck to you both.” 

i4 Thank you, Gerald York,” said 
Pertin gravely. He stepped up to the 
transport portal, waited for the 
signal and entered, giving a half 
wave to Bielowitz as the door 
closed behind him. 

This was the fourth time he had 
found himself in a tachyon 
transporter box, or at least the 
fourth time that he remembered. 
They all looked about the same. On 
tbe inside they were featureless ex- 
cept for what seemed to be studs 
or nailheads almost" completely 
covering each of the six interior sur- 
faces. He stood there for a moment 
and felt nothing. 

But something was going on. The 
sensors were counting, locating and 
identifying every atom in his body, 
measuring their bonds to adjacent 
atoms, charting them in a precise 
three-dimensional matrix. The in- 
formation obtained they encoded 
into a string of binary numbers, 
whereupon the great tachyon 
generators glowed into life, trans- 



mitting the numbers at a billibit per 
second in the direction of a point 
outside the farthest spiral arm of 
the galaxy, where the ship Ben 
Pertin had just volunteered to 
serve on — and to die on — lay 
waiting. 



I T WAS here — in the tachyon 
transmission chamber— that the 
great identity problem that plagued 
all the space-exploring humans had 
its genesis. Freud would have found 
its implications thrilling. It was 
another womb — with a completely 
different set of birth traumas. 

All tachyon transmission was 
enormously expensive both in psy* 
chic cost and in cash. Its only jus- 
tification was that it was indis- 
pensable. If you wanted to get a 
man or an instrument or a shipload 
of chess sets from one point in the 
universe to some other point across 
interstellar distances you had only 
two choices. One was to build a 
rocket' preferably fusion-powered 
like the one Pertin was going 
to. You then had to launch it 
and set it on its way— and then 
wait. Wait indefinitely, for it could 
take anywhere from a decade or 
two to geologic eras beforp it 
reached another star, even one rela- 
tively nearby. If you wanted to go 
farther than that you would wait 
forever. A voyage from a spiral arm 
to the core or from any point in. the 
galaxy to the deeps of intergalactic 
space was simply out of the time

IF 




consciousness of any race but the 
T’Worlie. 

The other method was faster. It 
dispensed with attempting to 
transport matter at all. Instead of 
sending an object you sent a blue- 
print of the object and had it built 
from plan at the destination. 

The procedure was not simple. It 
required enormous expenditures of 
energy to generate the tachyon 
stream that carried the blueprint. It 
required complex scanning devices 
to measure every atom and mol- 
ecule in the object to be transmit- 
ted and to encode positions and 
relationships for transmission. 
Above all, it required a tachyon 
receiver at the point to which you 
wanted to send — or go. 

But granted all those things, you 
could “travel” at the speed of the 
tachyons, those particles whose 
lower speed limit was the velocity 
of light, and whose upper limit had 
never been measured. 

The original object, of course, 
remained behind. It was scanned 
and its blueprints were encoded and 
then it was released unharmed. 
He who volunteered for a tachyon 
trip also stayed at home. What 
flashed across space was a descripr 
tion of himself and what emerged 
from the receiving chamber at 
destination w r as a newly built 
identical copy. There was no de- 
tectable difference between original 
and copy. It would have been a 
foolproof method of counterfeiting 
or of duplicating rare art objects — 



if it had not been so expensive in 
terms of power consumption that 
there was little worth the cost of 
duplicating. 

As a method of duplicating 
human beings, the process was 
more successful — it was perfect and 
unique. The man who entered a 
tachyon transmission chamber to 
be sent to Sun One was the same 
man who walked out of it and 
returned to his home on Earth — 
and was also the same man who 
emerged on Sun One to take up a 
wholly new life. The continuity was 
absolute. Neither was a “copy” in 
any physical sense. 

In a psychic sense the question of 
“reality” was troublesome. Every 
human who ventured into the star 
swarms was heavily briefed and in- 
doctrinated with endless philosoph- 
ical arguments and logical proofs. 
If you draw two triangles, which is 
the “real” triangle? (They both are, 
chorused the classes doubtfully.) If 
you build 10,000 Mercedes-Ford 
hovercars on an assembly line, 
which is the “real” Mercedes-Ford? 
(They all are.) Oh, the lecturers 
went on, there would eventually be 
differences among them. One car 
gets a scratch on the windshield 
when the wipers are installed. 
Another has a ripped gasket in its 
hydraulic system that, three years 
later, means its braking system has 
to be overhauled. But one is not an 
“imitation” or a “copy” of the 
other. Both are “real.” All of the 
Ben Pertins were Ben Pertin. The 



DOOMSHIP 



15 




custom that gave them differing 
middle names was only a con- 
venience, but they were all real — 
and, ladies and gentlemen, when 
you go out into space you will still 
be you. Not a copy. You. 

And the classes would nod and 
grin at each other and go on to their 
next training class. But that night 
each of them in his or her solitary 
bed would lie staring through 
closed eyes at a future that held two 
separate identities. And all through 
the courses the couches of the 
analysts were kept warm with the 
bodies of trainees trying to come to 
terms with the question of 
“reality.” 

But the process itself was easy, 
quick and painless. It was only 
moments until Ben Charles Pertin 
walked out of the box and shook 
hands with his head of mission. 

“You’re the best man I’ve got 
left,” said Bielowitz. “Thanks.’’ 

Pertin then went back to his of- 
fice and worked through the rest of 
the afternoon. He left a little early 
to meet his fiancee and take her to 
dinner and over the coffee she 
returned his troth ring. 

AT ABOUT the same time as Ben 
Charles Pertin was putting his 
ring back on his finger, inasmuch as 
time at two points separated by 
relativistic distances and velocities 
qm be called the “same,” Ben 
James Pertin pushed his way out of 
another, almost identical box on 
the probe ship. 

16 



He stopped just outside the ; 
portal, moving slightly to allow it to * 
close behind him. His expression 
was grim. “Lucked out,” he said 
aloud, looking around the unfa- 
miliar chamber. 

There was no one to hear-^or to 
see the bitter and despondent look 
on his face. The chamber was 
deserted. The probe was in free fall 
and Pertin floated slowly away 
from the transport. Nothing else - 
was floating in the room. There was , 
no litter, no sign that any other 
being of any sort was within thou- 
sands of light-years and, as he 
listened, he heard not even any 
sound. 

He swore softly to himself and 
twisted his body around to face the 
crated personal effects that were 
nudging their way out of the box. 
There wasn’t a great deal to ■' 
come — some tapes, some changes 
of clothing, personal items. At the 
end of the string of transmissions 
came his companion in the mission. 
Doc Chimp. 

Doc Chimp thrust out a long arm 
and caught the handle of the door 
as he went by. He hung there for a 
moment, staring at his environment 
with an expression that was a 
parody of Pertin’s own. 

“Oh, wow, Ben Charles,” he said 
sadly. “What a place.” 

“It’ll be ‘Ben James,’ I think,” 
said Pertin. 

“Sure,” said Doc Chimp 
dismally. “Me, I’m not going to 
bother. If you want to call me 



IF 




Pertin said, startled, “I don’t 
hear anything.” 

“Neither do I. But I smell it. It’s 
a T Worlie, coming fast.” 

T 'HE probe ship was T’Worlie 
property, but fortunately for 
the other races of the galaxy the 
T’Worlie didn’t have a very strong 
territorial imperative. 

• They had been civilized for a 
long, long time. They were an in- 
quisitive race in their unhurried 
way and no doubt that was why 
they had been sending their probes 
out for hundreds of generations. 
Little T’Worlie rockets had 
radiated in all directions from their 
mother star, some of them aimed at 
other stars, some at nothing closer 
than the Great Nebula in 
Andromeda, ten million years’ 
travel time away. 

Only a race like that, deploying 
probes as lavishly and patiently as 
that, could have discovered the cu- 
rious astronomical object called 
Lambda. No other race would have 
been in a position to do it. Sirians, 
with their limited time-binding ca- 
pacities that reached no more than 
a week into the future, wouldn’t 
have bothered. Nothing that 
promised some remote payoff 
interested them at all — which made 
them unattractive partners but 
inoffensive foes. Humans of course 
had no chance. Their technology 
wasn’t up to the job. The farthest 
terrestrial probe was still climbing 
toward the turnover point on its 



now senseless journey toward 40 
Eridani A. 

But the T’Worlie thought long, 
slow thoughts and they were gently 
but persistently curious about 
everything. If their race lived long 
enough it would learn everything 
there was to know. None of them 
seemed to mind that no T’Worlie 
now alive would be present to learn 
it. 

If the T’Worlie hadn’t been what 
they w£re, probably no one would 
have found Object Lambda for 
another several thousand years. It 
had been discovered first by an 
unmanned T’Worlie scoutship and 
reported in a routine synoptic 
survey. It attracted no attention at 
all. When first observed its great 
distance and low luminosity put it 
at the very threshhold of discovery 
and the traits that made it unique 
had not been detected. 

Subsequent observations at- 
tracted more attention. The Ob- 
ject’s weak spectral lines seemed to 
shift toward the violet rather than 
the red, which is to say that it was 
moving toward the galaxy instead 
of away from it. Curious. But the 
lines were so very weak, the point 
so very distant and the orderly 
T’Worlie had many other things on 
their agenda to investigate. 

Then, by accident, another scout 
turned up the same object in a 
survey. 

It might not have been 
recognized if the computers of the 
T’Worlie had not been so patient 



18 



IF 




and painstaking. The second scout 
had been launched five thousand 
years earlier, its vector several 
degrees away. From its point of 
view Object Lambda was in a 
wholly different part of the sky and 
its rate of approach, indicated by 
the spectral shift, quite different. 

But the computers had sensed a 
possible match and clucked over 
the figures until they confirmed it. 
There existed a specific, if 
hypothetical, orbit and velocity 
which, seen from those two scouts 
at those recorded times, would have 
given exactly those readings. 

From the estimated elements the 
computers made a prediction. They 
requested a special observation 
from still a third unmanned scout. 
Lo! it turned out as they had 
predicted. 

Object Lambda was not more 
than 20,000 light-years from the 
edge of the galaxy and was ap- 
proaching it at about one-sixth of 
light speed. 

At this point the T’Worlie an- 
nounced their discovery to the ga- 
lactic civilization at large and 
began a study of their existing 
drones in that general part of space. 

The T’Worlie drones were as 
small as an interstellar probe can be 
made — a scoop, a hydrogen ram, 
some instruments and a tachyon in- 
stallation. The T’Worlie had been 
launching them, thousands at a 
time, for tens of thousands of years. 
Since they had never invented war 
they were able to accumulate large 



quantities of surplus capital, so the 
probes were not a . particularly 
expensive project for them. Like 
most early-industrial races, they 
had energy to burn. They burned it. 
Their planet was largely wa- 
ter covered — though they looked 
like bats, they were somewhat more 
analogous to flying fish. Their 
water was rich in D 2 0 and they 
spent its fusion energies prof- 
ligately. 

The T’Worlie drone model was 
standardized early. A program was 
set up under which each drone, 
upon reaching a point suitably 
distant from all others, flashed a 
tachyonic signal to the T’Worlie 
planet, whereupon the tachyon 
transmitters scanned, encoded and 
transmitted whole new drones to 
the mother drone’s unit. As each 
new drone flashed into being, it sig- 
naled in to the T Worlie planet, was 
given a course and program of its 
own and moved on. The effect was 
of an enormous globe of drones — at 
the end thousands of millions of 
them — expanding outward like the 
shell of a dead supernova. 

The program was fully automatic 
and economical of everything W 
the energy eaten up by the tachyon 
transmitters — and for ten thousand 
years there seemed to be an endless 
supply of that. 

AT THE end even the TWorlie 
XjL began to realize that their 
energy resources, though huge, 
were not infinite. The drone 



DOOMSHIP 



19 




program was cut to a trickle. But it 
was never stopped and the great 
swelling bubble of drone ships 
expanded into globular clusters, out 
toward the neighboring galaxies, 
along the spiral arms, in toward the 
core of the Milky Way itself. It was 
a TWorlie drone that had buried it- 
self on Pluto and been found by the 
exploration from Earth. Besides 
humans, TWorlie drones had 
brought into the galactic society at 
least a hundred races at one time or 
another, almost half of the total so 
far located. Another race might 
have thought of using that fact to 
establish -dominance for itself, but 
the TWorlie didn’t think that way. 
They had never invented empires, 
either. 

So when the T’Worlie began to 
be deeply interested in Object 
Lambda it was easy enough for 
them to find some hundreds of 
drones on courses and at points that 
were not too remote from it. 

The next job for the TWorlie 
computers was calculating which of 
these drones was on the course that 
would involve least time and energy 
to divert it to the neighborhood of 
Lambda with its high galaxyward 
velocity. Fortunately a handful of 
drones in that section had been 
redirected inward much earlier to 
fill gaps in the global screen. 
Among them was one whose course 
would match Lambda’s in less than 
five years. 

After that there was no problem. 
The drone’s matter receiver was put 



to work giving birth to automatic 
tools, hull sections, drive . units, 
instruments, finally people. The 
tools went to work, assembling the 
hull sections, installing the drives, 
making room for the people. What 
had been a tiny kick-ram — no big- 
ger than Earth’s early Apollo 
capsule — was transformed and 
expanded into a thousand-meter 
vessel with room for a crew of 
several hundred 

There was, to be sure, one 
problem. 

The rebuilt TWorlie ship, now 
named Aurora, was big, but it 
needed to be big. It did not possess 
a great deal of surplus mass. 

It was driven by the sequential 
explosion of hydrogen fusion 
charges, directional in a cone- 
shaped blast against a great bat- 
tering plate at its base. Not much of 
the radiation from the fusion explo- 
sions seeped through the base plate, 
but some did. Enough for ionizing 
radiation constantly to bathe the 
members of the crew. 

TWorlie and Sheliaks, Pur- 
chased People and bits, robots and 
humans all responded to this in 
their individual, idiosyncratic racial 
ways. 

But few complex chemical or 
electronic processes can operate 
without damage in the presence of 
ionizing radiation. It didn’t matter 
who they were — in the long run it 
came to much the same for all of 
them. 

They died.

P ^ERTIN and the chimp scramr 
bled to the corridor entrance 
and peered out. The vinegary 
T’Worlie smell was strong now and 
they could hear the sounds of some- 
thing happening outside: a punc- 
tured-tire hiss, a faint high-pitched 
singing. 

A circus procession was sailing 
toward them down the center of the 
corridor. First came a TWorlie, 
bat’s head on butterfly body, no 
bigger than a pigeon but strong 
enough to be carrying a kitten-sized 
furry creature with enormous 
saucer eyes. Behind the T’Worlie, 
as it flew with powerful strokes of 
its green-spotted filmy wings, came 
a glittering cloud of steel-blue parti- 
cles — like a swarm of gnats in the 
sun — and behind them, coming fast 
but decelerating strongly because of 
its mass, the square-edged form of 
a Scorpian robot, all fore jets 
pumping reaction mass. 

The T’Worlie made its shrill 
whistling sounds and Hhe Pmal 
translator on Pertin’s shoulder rat^ 
tied into life. “I identify you as a 
Pertin,” it said with mechanical 
precision. “I propose you transfer 
at once to high-G accommodations 
suitable to your structure, mode ur- 
gent.” 

“Why, Nimmie!” cried Ben 
James, suddenly inexplicably, 
foolishly glad. “It’s good^-to see 
you.” 

The T’Worlie braked with its 



filmy wings and the five patterned 
eyes studied Pertin. “Verify your 
statement of identity,” the Pmal 
translator rattled in his ear. “Query 
implications. Request quick clarifi- 
cation.” 

“Why, it’s me, Ben Ch — Ben 
James Pertin. From Sun One. 
Why, just yesterday I saw you in 
the social concourse, remember?” 
But he stopped; this copy of the 
TWorlie he had known would not 
remember. 

The T’Worlie hesitated. It was 
some Nimmie or other, Pertin was 
sure; the key to recognizing 
T’Worlie was not the five eyes or 
the small sphincter mouth with its 
cat’s-whisker vibrissae, but the pat- 
terns on the wings. Green spots pre- 
dominating on a pale yellow back- 
ground — five of the bigger spots 
arranged in a sort of wobbly letter 
W, like the constellation Cassiopeia 
from Earth — yes, it was Nimmie, 
all right, Pertin knew.»But perhaps 
a Nimmie he had never met, in 
some different line of descent. 

The vinegary smell deepened. It 
was a sign of a polite cogitation in a 
T’Worlie, like a human being’s 
Hmmm. But Nimmie did not 
respond, exactly. He was distracted 
by the swarm of tiny beings which 
Pertin recognized as the collective 
entity called Boaty Bits. They swept 
into the tachyon transport room, 
swirled around Pertin and the 
chimp and reformed under the 
T Worlie’s wings. 

The kitten-like creature spoke 



DOOMSHIP 



21 




with a voice like a purr. The trans- that could not be carried on during 
lator rendered it as: “No time kid- deceleration times. The rest of the 
ding around, get hell out!” The time the entire ship suffered under a 
TWorlie concurred. “Mode ur- surging, uneven, pulsing drive that 
gent. Accept transportation via averaged nearly seven gravities, 
robot. Your physical safety at The welcoming-and-transporting 
risk!” ~ committee barely got Pertin and 

Doc Chimp chattered, “I told Doc Chimp to a. place of refuge 
you I wasn’t going to like this place, before the thrusters started again. 
Ben James. It isn’t safe. Of course, The Boaty Bits had darted away at 
I’m only a monkey, so it doesn’t the first warning white-noise 
matter much about me. It’s you I "blast — they could not operate at all 



worry about.” 

“You’re an ape,” Pertin cor- 
rected automatically, his brain 
concentrating on what the TWorlie 
had said. 

“Sure, but an ape that knows 
what isn’t safe. Come on, Ben 
James! Let’s do like bat-ears says 
and split!” 

The decision was taken from 
Pertin. The Scorpian hissed slowly 
by, still decelerating. It came to a 
stop, reversed itself and began to 
pick up momentum for the return. 
And as it passed Pertin and Doc 
Chimp it simply caught them up, 
each under a silvery tentacle, and 
bore them away. In reverse order 
the procession steamed away — first 
the robot with the two terrestrial 
primates, then the swarm of bit 
creatures, then the T’ Worlie and its 
passenger. 




power was off only for short 
periods, long enough to permit 
instrument readings or other work 



under thrust and had to find safety 
lest they be stepped on. The: 
TWorlie and his passenger were 
next to go, leaving only the robot to 
see to tucking Pertin and Doc 
Chimp in. The robot had no par- 
ticular objection to high gravity. 
Pertin had noticed that on the trip 
from the tachyon chamber. When 
the robot had to change direction it 
simply braced itself with a few of 
the steel-coil tentacles, stopped 
against whatever was in the way 
and pushed off in another direction,' 
The sensation for Pertin was like 
being tossed around at the end of a 
cracking whip, but he survived it. 

The thrusting started before the 
robot had finished sealing their 
cocoons and it was even worse then 
the ride. The cocoons were meant 
to protect them against it — were 
tailor-made to their dimensions, 
equipped with the best of springing 
devices and every comfort. But 
there was no such thing as anti- 
gravity and that was what was 
needed. 

The. robot tarried for a moment. 

IF 



22 




It could no longer jet about, but its 
tentacles held it easily off the floor, 
octopus-like. As the thrusts came 
they gave gently, then returned to 
position. 

It seemed to be trying to com- 
municate. Pertin, looking out of the 
cocoon faceplate, shrugged and 
spread his hands. One Scorpian 
looked like another, but if this one 
had come from Sun One it might 
recognize the human gesture. The 
trouble was, there was no way to 
tell whether it was responding to it. 

Then the Pmal crackled into life: 
“ — not move. Prerequisite explana- 
tions to you. I am repeating this on 
all comm frequencies. Most im- 
perative you not move. Prerequi- 
site—” 

The sound faded again as the 
robot evidently shifted to another 
possible frequency. “All right,” 
said Pertin, “we’ll wait.” But 
whether the robot understood him 
or not he could not say — it rested 
there on its tentacles, swaying 
under the thrust, for a few moments 
more and then undulated away. 

The probe was decelerating fu- 
riously now — a roller-coaster ride 
multiplied by a hundred. There was 
a lot more noise then Pertin had ex- 
pected — the thudding of the nu- 
clear engines and the screeching 
of the torsion-bar shock absorbers 
that did their best to leVel out the 
thrust, 

“Doc,” he called. “Can you hear 
me?” 

The chimp’s cocoon was only 



yards away, but the thuud-screech 
drowned out all other sounds. 
Pertin stared around. The room 
was half machine. Bright metal 
valves, gray plastic tubes coiling 
like dead entrails, colored screens 
where enigmatic symbols flickered 
and vanished. The walls were a 
sick, off-color green. No human 
would have designed a room like 
this, but of course it had not been 
designed for humans in the first 
place. It was a standard T’Worlie 
cocoon container, modified to take 
terrestrials. 

The thud-screech pounded on 
and on. Experimenting with the 
cocoon, Pertin discovered that it 
would meter an anesthetic dose into 
his veins — or even a selective anal- 
gesic to deaden the auditory nerve 
for a time and block out the re- 
morseless nuclear thunder. But he 
didn’t want to sleep. He wasn’t 
tired — he wanted to get about his 
business. When your time is run- 
ning out, he thought, you don’t like 
to lose any of it. 

Then he discovered that the 
cocoon had a built-in stereo stage. 

The device was not wholly fa- 
miliar, but with any luck he should 
be able to. reach Doc Chimp, at 
least. His first attempt was not a 
success. He gently turned a knurled 
pointer under the hollow silver 
hemisphere of the stage and was de- 
lighted to see it fill with the shining 
silver mist that indicated it was 
operating. 

But when the mist abruptly 



DOOMSHIP 



23 




condensed it was to show the image 
of a nude blonde. “Mr. Pertin, sir,” 
she caroled sweetly, “welcome 
aboard! Tonight for your enter- 
tainment, sir, you may watch me 
star in The Belle of Bellatrix. A 
thriller-drama of the love of a 
human beauty for a mutated alien 
and its fatal consequences. Feel the 
fear of the terrified girl! Share the 
wrath of her human lover! Feel the 
coils of the monster around her! 
Taste its dying blood! All these 
available by using the sen-sat coils 
in the small cabinet by your right 
hand. We have many other stereo- 
stage fiches, Mr. Pertin, and — ” 

He finally got the fiche turned off 
and the nude blonde vanished, still 
smiling. She dissipated as the 
camera zoomed in at her until at 
the end all that was left was a 
Cheshire-cat smile and the memory 
of her pale, slim figure. 

Then the stereo stage blinked, 
swirled with color, solidified and 
Doc Chimp’s homely face was 
staring out at him. 

“Got you,” cried Pertin, pleased. 
“I didn’t think I would be so 
lucky.” 

“You weren’t,” said the chimp. 
“I called you. I want to volunteer 
for something.” 

The chimpanzee face looked 
subduedr Pertin said, “What?” 

“I think I ought to take a look 
around,” said Doc Chimp sadly. 
“God knows I don’t want to. But 
most of the beings will be tied down 
to pressure cocoons and I’m not.” 



“Good idea,” said Pertin, a little 
surprised. He hadn’t known the 
chimp well on Sun One — it wasn’t 
that he was prejudiced .against 
mutated animals, but of course they 
didn’t have much in common. But 
he had an impression of Doc 
Chimp’s personality that was at 
variance with the act of 
volunteering for a solitary ex- 
cursion into what might be trouble. 
Humorous, pleasure-seeking, a lit- 
tle lazy — that was how he would 
have described the chimp. “And 
thanks,” he added. “Meanwhile I’ll 
just send a report to Sun One if I 
can figure out how to use this stereo 
stage.” 

“Ah,” said Doc Chimp, the 
mocking light in his eyes again, 
“allow me to instruct you, mighty 
human. You know, I figured you’d 
be too involved with high-level 
considerations to take much 
interest in hardware. So I checked 
out all the instrumentation with the 
TWorlie on Sun One before we 
left.” 

I T ONLY took a few minutes for 
Pertin to learn to operate the 
stereo stage in his cocoon — it was 
not, after all, basically anything but 
a stereo stage and they were com- 
mon all over the galaxy. Then he 
lifted himself on one elbow against 
the surging thrusts of the drive— the 
cocoon’s self-adjusting circuits buz- 
zed busily, trying to compensate for 
his unusual position — and watched 
the chimp cautiously lever himself 



24 IF 




over the side of his own cocoon, 
timing his movements to the 
surging of the drive, drop clumsily 
to the floor, mutter to himself an- 
grily for i moment and then slowly, 
painfully lurfiber off on all fours. 
He did not look back. 

Pertin felt curiously better, as 
though he had discovered a friend 
where he had expected only an 
inadequate tool. He worked the 
controls of the stereo stage, got 
himself a circuit through to the re- 
cording fiches of the tachyon com- 
municator and spoke. 

“This is Ben James Pertin,” he 
said, “reporting in to Sun One. Doc 
Chimp and I have arrived safely. 
There was no apparent problem 
from the transmission-r-at least, we 
look all right, are breathing and our 
hearts are working. Whether our 
brains are scrambled or not 1 could 
not say. No more than when we 
volunteered for this, anyway, I’d 
guess. We have seen very little of 
the probe, have contacted only a 
few of the personnel, but in general 
the situation appears much as we 
understood it. At present I am in an 
acceleration couch, waiting for the 
next period of free fall for further 
investigation. Doc Chimp, who is 
performing very well and deserves 
credit; has voluntarily left on a 
scouting mission. 

“I’ll report again when I have 
something to say,” he finished. 
“And— personal to Ben Charles 
Pertin: Have a good time on my 
honeymoon.” 



He snapped off the stage before 
he could decide to erase the last 
part of the message. 

In spite of the best efforts of the 
cocoon his kidneys were beginning 
to feel bruised. The noise was even 
more of a problem. Efficient sound- 
proofing kept it out of the cocoon 
as airborne vibrations — but there 
was too’much of it to be shut out 
entirely. It seeped through as a con- 
tinual thunder and squeal. 

Pertin shut it out of his mind, 
thought of sleep, decided to brush 
up on his knowledge of the 
“hardware.” 

His first attempt at the fiche li- 
brary of the stereo stage was only 
half successful. He just managed to 
avert the reappearance of the bare- 
skinned blonde and found he had 
secured a record transmitted by 
another member of the crew, race 
unspecified, apparently for a sort of 
public stereo-stage broadcast on its 
home planet. He shut out of his 
mind the public broadcaster he 
should have been getting ready to 
marry about this time— some thou- 
sands of light-years away he was 
getting ready to marry her — and 
discovered that the name of the 
vessel was the Aurora , or Dawn . 
The sound was, of course, different 
in the T’Worlie tongue and they 
had named it— but he learned it 
held the same connotations of new 
day and bright glowing promise in 
both cultures. He also found that he 
had only limited facilities for 
recreation — well, he had expected

that. There were tape-fiche libraries 
for almost every known race of 
beings, some special high-pressure 
atmosphere chambers for a. few of 
the exotics. That was it. 

K i had not learned exactly what 
he wanted, so he tried again. 
But instead of getting a fiche on the 
ship itself he got one on its mission, 
evidently a briefing record dubbed 
for humans. It was narrated by a 
man Pertin recognized as a minor 
functionary on Sun One. 

He spoke in a high-pitched voice, 
smiling emptily at the stereo 
pickup: “We will show you all that 
is known about Object Lambda. 
First we will locate it, as it would be 
seen from Earth if visible at that 
distance.” 

Behind the speaker another 
stereo-stage tank glowed, shim- 
mered and filled with a universe of 
stars. Two of the brighter ones 
pulsed to call attention to 
themselves as the man spoke. 

“Those stars are Benetnasch in 
Ursa Major and Cor Caroli in 
Canes Venatici. Those faint stars 
over there — ” as he spoke a faint 
line of light ran around an area of 
the tank, enclosing it in a square—” 
are in Coma Berenices, near the 
north galactic pole. Now we’ll take 
a closer look.” 

Benetnasch and Cor Caroli swam 
aside. The faint stars on Coma 
Berenices grew brighter, spreading 
apart, as the. whole field seemed to 
move. The bright points fled out of 



the sides of the stage, and the few 
remaining ones became brighter 
until only a few were left — and be- 
yond them ghostly faint blurs that 
were no longer part of the Milky 
Way but galaxies in their own right. 

TTie illusion of motion stopped. 

Another square of light formed 
around a patch of blackness in the 
center of the stage, indistin- 
guishable from the emptiness 
around it. 

The man ' said, “Now we’ve 
reached the limits of Sol-orbiting 
instruments. Object Lambda is at 
the center of that square, but it is 
invisible. It is slightly better in the 
far infrared.” 

The pattern of stars shimmered. 
Some became brighter, some dim- 
mer, and in the center of the square 
appeared what might have been a 
faint and shapeless glow. 

“This is not instantaneous,” 
explained the lecturer. “It’s long 
exposure and image-intensified. 
The Object would never have been 
detected in routine sweeps from 
Sol-based instruments. Even the 
TWorlie scouts first detected it 
only because of a chance occul- 
tation of some stars in the Milky 
Way itself, seen from beyond. 
What we will show you next is not 
aa actual observation but an ar- 
tifact as it would look from Earth, 
as deduced from all available 
observations.” 

The object brightened a half- 
dozen magnitudes as he spoke. “As 
you see, it has a sort of tipped-disk 



26 



IF 




shape, like certain classifications of 
external galaxies. However, that’s 
not what it is. First of all, it is far 
too small, perhaps only two or 
three A.U. in diameter. Second, its 
spectrum is wrong. 

“At its apparent distance, as de- 
termined by its angular diameter — 
if it were indeed a galaxy — it should 
be receding at a major fraction of 
the speed of light. Of course we 
know from triangulation from the 
T’Worlie ships that that distance is 
wrong by a good many orders of 
magnitude. But according to its 
spectrum displacement it is actually 
approaching the Milky Way at 
nearly relativistic speeds.” 

The image blurred and disap- 
peared and the plump human was 
standing there by himself. He said 
with satisfaction, “The T’Worlie 
scout has confirmed the speed as 
accurate in the range of 50,000 kps. 
Its position relative to Earth is 
some 30,000 light-years from Sol, 
in the direction of a point near the 
northern fringe of Coma Berenices. 
It is not an object from our galaxy. 
There are no spiral arms in that di- 
rection and few isolated stars or 
clusters much nearer than Sol itself. 

“The T’Worlie backplotted its 
position from all observations of 
their drones, as recorded over the 
past several thousand years. Most 
of the data are ambiguous, but they 
did establish a probable line of 
flight. Their hope was to find a 
galaxy from which it might have 
been ejected and then to try to dis- 



cover the reason for its high-ve- 
locity. 

“But they were only partly suc- 
cessful — I should say, only possibly 
successful. No such galaxy was de- 
tected. They did, however, find 
scattered star swarms which they 
believe to be the fragments of a 
galaxy that collapsed and then 
exploded more than a half-billion 
years ago. It is the present working 
hypothesis that Object Lambda was 
ejected from that galaxy, by what 
means we cannot say.” 

The speaker’s expression became 
enthusiastic. “Because of the 
anomalous nature of Object 
Lambda,” he said, “the all-race 
conference on Sol One decided to 
transmit a full-size scout ship 
through the drone equipment and 
to staff it with a crew of volunteers 
of all races.” Volunteers! thought 
Pertin, grimacing. “And after 
considerable effort in negotiating, it 
was agreed to include Earth hu- 
mans as part of the crew. The po- 
litical implications of this step are 
of enormous consequence and 
reflect the true coming of age of 
Earth humanity in the galaxy- wide 1 
confraternity of civilized peoples. 
Thank you,” he said, bowed, smiled 
and disappeared as the fiche came 
to an end. 

Not a minute too soon, thought 
Pertin. A little more of that and he 
would have been ill. The cocoon 
had a fine built-in waste handling 
system, but there was no sense in 
overloading it.

IV 

H E BEGAN to see what Zara 
had been talking about when 
she accused him of an “Earthman’s 
burden” complex. This whole deal 
sounded pompous, stupid and 
faintly threatening, he realized, as it 
was put by the man in the briefing 
fiche. He tried to get his mind off 
that track — because he didn’t want 
to question the cause for which he 
was, after all, going to die, and be- 
cause above all he didn’t want to 
think about Zara Doy. He was in 
the middle of trying to get The 
Belle of Bellatrix back on the stage 
when he became aware that some- 
thing was scratching angrily at his 
cocoon. 

For a moment he thought he was 
dreaming. He glanced back at the 
fading nude on the screen, then out 
at the nude girl who stood there. 

But Pertin was a pretty superior 
type and he oriented himself 
quickly. It was no girl. It was not 
even human. It was a female young 
Earth person in shape, but the stuff 
of which the shape was constructed 
was not flesh and blood. 1 It was sil- 
very and bright, with a metallic 
hue. The eyes were orange and 
glowing. The hair was not made up 
of separate tendrils; it was a single 
solid piece, sculptured slightly for 
cosmetic effect. The creature was, 
in short, he realized, an “edited” 
version of some methane-breather 
or even more exotic chemistry, 
some being who was structurally 



non-viable in oxygen-bearing air 
and had had itself transmitted in an 
altered form to take up tis duties on 
Aurora . And it was holding a scrap 
of what looked like paper. 

The paper was not right side up. 
Pertin gestured and Anally the 
“girl” understood and rotated it 
until, able to read it, he signaled her 
to stop. He read: 

Sorry, Ben James, but you’ve 
got to get out of there. Things 
are worse than we thought. 
Angel here will carry you to 
me. They guarantee she won’t 
drop you and squash you and 
actually, Ben James, this seems 
to be a matter of life and death. 

The note was signed “Doc.” 

The girl, did not speak, but the 
orange eyes blazed imperatively 
and the hands beckoned. 

Pertin sighed, and opened the lid 
of his cocoon. “Okay Angel,” he 
said. “Carry me away.” 
Astonishingly, being carried by 
the pseudo-girl was actually worse 
than being toted by the robot, but 
she moved more slowly and Pertin 
had a chance to see something of 
the ship. The Aurora was roughly 
cone-shaped. At the nose^ and 
through the midsection were living 
quarters for the several score indi- 
viduals who manned it — that was 
where they had entered to scene. 
Since the crew varied widely, it 
needed a good deal of room. Space 
had been provided for methane- 
dwellers, space-flyers and cold

IF 




creatures as well as the more com- 
mon forms based on C-O^-FLO — 
however, most of the nonviables 
had either stayed home or sent 
proxies or edited copies, so these 
spaces were largely empty. 
“Below” the living quarters and the 
space for the exotics were the 
hardware instrument sections. 
Below them still — in the sense of 
being sternward, toward the 
thrusters — was a layer of dense 
liquid for a radiation shield. It was 
not very effective, but of course, 
Pertin thought, it didn’t have to 
keep them alive forever, since there 
was neither hope for nor point in 
the system's doing so. Below the 
shield wasthe tachyon transmission 
deck, where Pertin and the chimp 
had arrived. And beyond them, the 
thrusters and shock-absorbing gear. 
Since the Aurora was decelerating, 
it happened that the “stern” of the 
ship came first in line of flight, but 
that made little difference to 
anyone aboard. It was “down.” 
And down was the direction they 
were going. 

The pseudo-girl had wrapped 
Pertin in a thick blanket of some- 
thing like heavy-duty plastic fbam. 
It was not as good as his cocoon by 
a long shot, but it kept him from 
dying of the ceaseless grinding 
changes in gravity as the thrusters 
shoved and the “girl” levered 
herself down a ladder-like series of 
projecting rods. She did not speak, 
nor acknowledge Pertin’s efforts to 
speak to her. Either there was 



something wrong with his Pmal 
translator or she simply was not a 
conversationalist. But she was 
considerate enough and when they 
reached the instrument deck Pertin 
was bruised and sick, but alive. 

“Ben James!” cried a familiar 
voice. “I told you Angel would get 
you here all right!” 

Doc Chimp, thin lips grinning 
widely, scrambled over to help the 
silvery girl put him down, propping 
him against a sloping bulkhead so 
he could look around. His ship- 
mates were worth looking at— a 
nightmare crew if he ever had seen 
one. Besides the pseudo-girl and the 
mutated chimp, there was a Sheliak 
in its high-G mode, looking like a 
flattened baker’s bun on the deck. 
A web of plastic foam hid an ap- 
parently humansized figure. Pertin 
also saw a row of small cocoons. 
Two were empty — the third 
contained a T’Worlie. From a 
speaker outside the cocoon a 
T’Worlie voice whistled a greeting 
and Pertin’s Pmal translated: “I 
recognize your identity, Ben James 
Pertin. It is advantageous to all of 
us that you are here.” 

“Thanks, Nimmie,” said Pertin, 
but he was staring at the plastic 
wrappings. A human being seemed 
to be concealed, in them and, apart 
from himself, he knew of only one 
human being on the Aurora — one 
he didn’t really want to think about. 

He asked softly, “Doc, who’s 
over there?” 

Doc Chimp said, “Who? Her? 



DOOMSHIP 



29 




Oh, I don’t know her name. She’s 
Purchased People for some low-G 
type of other. But she’s on our 
side.” The wfcb stirred and a face 
peered out. It was human enough as 
far as features went, but the 
emptiness in the eyes told Pertin. 
that Doc Chimp was right. 
“Anyway,” chattered the chimp, “I 
better fill you in. Hell’s really 
broken loose, Ben James. A bunch 
of beings tried to wreck the tele- 
scope. Not sure but what they’ve 
done it, too— the Scorpian’s trying 
to see how much of it can be 
salvaged. If it and Angel here 
hadn’t come along we’d be out of 
business till they could send new 
instruments through — and by then 
it would likely be too late.” 

The thuud-screech was a lot 
closer here — apart from everything 
else, it was making Pertin’s head 
pound. “What beings?” he 
managed to croak. 

“Didn’t see them. I just saw 
somebody disappearing into a 
passage, and then the Shetiak here 
came hellfire fast after him and saw 
me. For a minute he thought I was 
them.” Doc Chimp cocked his head 
ruefully. “You could have found 
yourself short a monkey right there, 
Ben James, if I hadn’t talked fast. 
So he commandeered me to help 
and we came down here to hold the 
fort. Oh, how sore my soles and 
knuckles are, Ben James, against 
the pounding of those rockets! But 
I did my duty. Then we got the 
observatory deck sealed off — 



they’d used a chemical explosive On 
the telescope and sprung a port — 
and then I happened to think of my 
human master, off there watching 
The Belle of Bellatrix without a 
care, and I persuaded Angel to 
fetch you.” 

Pertin frowned. “I don’t quite see 
why,” he objected. “I can’t help.”- 
“You can stay alive,” declared 
the chimp. “I didn’t tell you all of 
it. When they came for the tele- 
scope they had to get past the 
T’Worlie here. Well, you know 
TWorlie can’t do much against 
any being that can operate in high- 
G. But they tried to do what they 
could. And two of them got killed.” 

T HAT was a shocker. One car- 
dinal rule among the races of 
the galaxy was that no race could 
ever kill Or seriously' maim a 
member of another. Even on Sun 
One disciplinary problems were 
handled within the delegation of the 
race that produced the problem. 
Some provision existed for a body 
of other races sitting in judgment if 
the offending race failed to deal 
with the problem, but it had never 
had to be invoked. Pertin would 
hardly have believed the chimp if 
Nimmie hadn’t confirmed the facts. 

“They’re crazy, then,” said 
Pertin. “All right. We’ll have to get 
a report back to Sun One. Nimmie, 
is your stereo stage operating?” 
“Confirm that it is operative,” 
sang the Pmal in his ear. “State 



30 



IF 




that such a transmission has al- 
ready been sent.” 

“Good. I’ll have to send one, too, 
and I think the rest of us should, 
but that can wait.” He tried to shift 
position as the floor surged particu- 
larly viciously. “Since we’re here 
they probably won’t try anything 
right away. What we need is a comb- 
out — get every being on board to 
account for his whereabouts and try 
to identify the ones who did it. For 
that we need a little free-fall. Can 
we arrange that?” 

The silvery girl spoke at last. Ap- 
parently she had heard everything, 
had simply seen no need to com- 
ment. “We can have a little free- 
fall. We can have a comb-out. We 
probably won’t need to arrange it 
right away as next observation pe- 
riod is only — ” A meaningless 
squawk followed. 

Doc Chimp filled in: “She means 
about fifteen minutes away.” 

It took a moment for Pertin to 
realize that the girl’s words had 
been in English. He looked at her 
curiously. 

“Fine,” he said. “How many 
were involved in the bombing?” 
“There were not less than three 
nor more than eight.” piped the 
Pmal translator, responding to the 
T’Worlie’s whistle. 

“Out of how many in the crew?” 
The TWorlie hesitated. “There 
are in excess of three hundred thou- 
sand beings at present existing 
within the ship hull. Of these a large 
number are collective creatures.” 



“Not counting the Boaty Bits — I 
mean how many individuals?” 
“There are not less then two 
hundred forty nor more than two 
hundred fifty.” 

Pertin said, “So the trouble- 
makers arc a tiny fraction. That’s 
good. We’ll broadcast a shipwide 
alarm. Most of the crew will 
cooperate — ” 

He stopped, staring at the silver 
pseudo-girl. “What’s the matter?” 
She had stretched out her 
fingertips toward the entrance port, 
almost in the traditional pose of a 
human sleepwalker. “The matter,” 
she said in her incongruous collo- 
quial English, the tones as deep as 
Pertin’s own, “is that the tiny 
fraction of troublemakers is coming 
back.” 

I N A moment no one needed the 
silvery girl’s fingers to pick up 
the audios — the rushing sound grew 
rapidly louder, a harsh, crackling, 
electrical noise like the patter of a 
collapsing charge field. Into the 
room burst what looked at first like 
a single huge blue eye. “Sirian!” 
howled Doc Chimp in terror, and 
tried to leap out of the way. Even 
his simian muscles did not have the 
strength to leap against the sud- 
denly surging G-force of the 
rockets. He stumbled and fell 
heavily against the silvery girl. At 
one stroke two-thirds of the beings 
able to move at all in the high-G 
field werq immobilized — thd 

T’Worlie, the Purchased Person 



DOOMSHIP 



31 




and Ben Pertin himself were wholly 
useless while the rockets were on. 
The Sirian, moving by electrostatic 
forces, was immune to mere 10 and 
12-G thrusts. He bore with him 
something that glittered, carried 
under the great forward eye in a 
pair of crablike pincers, tiny and al- 
most invisible. 

Pertin, thrown heedlessly just in- 
side the portal, was first in the 
creature’s path. He did not even 
have time to realize he was in 
danger before the Sirian was upon 
him. Then, oddly, the great eye 
stared at him. The Sirian paused, 
hesitated and turned away. It pro- 
pelled its glittering metal object at 
the bulkhead and at once reversed 
its field and sped away. 

If that was another bomb, Pertin 
thought, they’d all had it now; be- 
yond that bulkhead was empty 
space from the last attack. The rest 
of the ship might be saved if the au- 
tomatic seals worked fast enough, 
but he himself, the Purchased 
Person, Doc Chimp and the 
TWorlie would be boiled into outer 
space. 

But he had forgotten the Sheliak. 
The soggy baker’s bun that 
slumped on the deck and had taken 
no part in the conversation was still 
in fact an able and intelligent being. 
It acted faster than Pertin would 
have believed possible. The bun 
shape elongated itself into a sort of 
stemmed sea anemone, flowed like 
lightning up and down around the 
bomb, surrounding it, drowning it 



in thick alien flesh. It expolded. 

The only sign the rest of them 
could see was a quick convulsive 
shudder of the Sheliak’s tissue. 
Even the noise was muffled and al- 
most inaudible in the constant 
thunder of the rockets. 

The Sheliak glowed brilliant gold 
for a moment and, with a flash of 
the last light Of its life, died. 

They had defended themselves, 
but at the cost of one of their allies. 

As though on cue the thunder of 
the rockets stopped and they found 
themselves blessedly free of the 
crushing G forces. Doc Chimp, 
struggling to untangle himself from 
the silvery girl, went flying across 
the chamber, ricocheted against a 
wall and brought up short next, to 
where Pertin was struggling to 
disassociate himself from the 
plastic foam. 

“Are you all right, Ben James?” 
Pertin pushed himself free and 
caught the outstretched chimpanzee 
arm for stability. He ached in every 
bone and muscle and he was 
drenched in sweat from the trapped 
heat of the plastic wrap or from 
fear — he could not say. 

“I think so,” he said. “Why do 
you suppose he did that?” 

“What? Who? You mean the 
Sheliak? Why, I guess it’s their 
nature, Ben James — ” 

“No, not the Sheliak,” said 
Pertin, but he didn’t say out loud 
what it was that was perplexing 
him. He only thought it to himself. 
Why had the Sirian look at him 



32 



IF 




with death in his eye, then stopped 
and turned away? 

I T TURNED out there were two 
things wrong with Pertin’s cal- 
culations. First, the odds weren’t 
quite as favorable has he had 
guessed; he had not thought of the 
fact that the bombers might have 
allies who were as gravity-bound as 
himself and so hadn’t put in_an ap- 
pearance. Second, he had not 
realized that most of the beings 
aboard the Aurora simply didn’t 
want to be bothered with the 
mission. They were apathetic, 
hopeless, detached, or in some 
exotic mood with no human 
analogue. And perhaps, here and 
there, they just weren’t about to 
take orders from an upstart biped 
from Earth. 

The other problem was that the 
work of the Aurora lay in observing 
Object Lambda, not in tracking 
down aberrant entities. Not even 
the fact that beings of one or two 
races had killed beings of another 
race could cloud the goal. The 
Scorpian robot, when it returned 
from patching together what it 
could of the damaged optical equip- 
ment, would not even take time to 
talk to Pertin. It went at once to its 
assigned place in the instrument 
chamber and began to oversee the 
series of observations — this had 
been the reason, evidently, for the 
thrust stoppage. 

Pertin could not even get the free- 
fall period extended to permit a 



full-scale search of the ship. The- 
TWorlie pointed out to him, 
reasonably enough, that since they 
were all going to die anyhow the 
first priority was the errand for 
which they had all undertaken to 
give their lives — to complete the 
observation of Object Lambda. 
And the laws of celestial dynamics 
were remorseless. A certain 
quantum of delta-V had to be ap- 
plied to Aurora’s course. There was 
only finite time in which to do it. If 
they failed to put in the necessary 
velocity change the probe would fly 
past Object Lambda too fast to ac- 
complish its several missions. So 
the TWorlie were going to work 
on their instrument observations 
and nothing else, although they cer- 
tainly wished him well, they indi- 
cated, in his search for the guilty 
ones. 

What he had to work with-turned 
out tp be a party of five — Pertin, 
Doc Chimp, the pseudo-girl, the 
Purchased-People woman and a 
small kittenish being who had 
joined the party to greet them on 
arrival. They couldn’t even recruit 
the Boaty Bits to their cause. As 
soon as the collective creatures had 
learned of the bombing attempt 
they had departed en masse to 
swarm in some obscure corner of 
the vessel and unite all their in- 
telligence on the problem of 
deciding what to do about it. 

Pertin saw a great deal of the 
ship, but found no criminals. The 
one being they had certainly 



DOOMSHIP 



33 




identified, the Sirian, eluded their 
search. If a being the size of a 
horse, emitting an electrostatic 
crackle every time it moved, could 
avoid the searchers, what chance 
had they for locating a party of 
unidentified marauders? Not any 
chance, answered echo. They found 
nothing. 

ABOUT ail they really accom- 
-/V. plished was to move the ac- 
celeration cocoons for the low-G 
beings, whom they had come to 
think of as friends, close enough 
together so that they could watch 
out for each other when the delta-V 
thrust immobilized them. There 
were many such periods. By the 
nature of things, there had to be. It 
was thuuud-screech for at least 
eighty per cent of the time, cut up 
the individual portions as they 
would. The Aurora had thousands 
of kps of velocity to shed as it over- 
took Lambda, if they were to avoid 
overrunning it too fast for orbiting 
their package. It made little dif- 
ference how it felt to the members 
of the crew. 

To Pertin it felt like being kicked 
in the kidneys four or five limes a 
minute for hours on end. With 
allowances for variations in 
anatomy, it felt very much the same 
to most of the beings. Frail little 
creatures like the T’Worlie were 
particularly hard hit — or would 
have been if it hadn’t been for the 
fact that the Aurora was their own 
design, cocoons and all, and many 



thousands of years of thought had 
gone into reducing the damage to a 
T’Worlie frame in a cocoon. It was 
an advantage of a sort, but against 
it was the overpowering debit that 
on their native planet the surface 
gravity was less than a quarter-G. 
They were not creatures designed 
for strain. 

The unfelt pain was the worst. 
,Every explosion produced noise and 
thrust, but it also sleeted a few 
more curies of radiation through 
the crew’s bodies and brought each 
member a few hours nearer to 
death. As the damage was not 
felt — and asThere was nothing that 
could be done about it — the beings 
seldom spoke of it to each other. 

For a half-dozefi periods no 
further violence bccurred on board 
and the Aurora went on about its 
business. Pertin reserved his time in 
the cocoon for taping his endless 
reports to Sun One and for in- 
specting and studying the 
observation results on Object 
Lambda. When there was the 
blissful floating surcease — for half 
an hour or so at a time — he used it 
to roam around the ship. His an- 
nounced purpose was to watch out 
for trouble. As time passed and 
trouble did not come he stopped 
talking about it, but continued to 
roam. He was interested in the ship 
on its own merits. Simply by its 
novelty it helped take his mind off 
the growing number of things he 
didn’t want to think about. The 
Aurora was the first real spaceship 



34 



IF 




he had ever seen. The concept 
seemed strange to him, considered 
against the tens of thousands of 
light-years he had traveled since he 
volunteered for tachyon trans- 
mission from Earth. It was normal 
enough, though. Sun One was thick 
with beings who had crossed and re- 
crossed the galaxy a dozen times 
and never seen a spaceship at all. 

Object Lambda was getting per- 
ceptibly closer — not to the eye, to 
be sure. No eye on the ship was in a 
position to see it anyway. But the 
cameras were able to make out 
more and more detail — not easily 
or well, because its intrinsic lu- 
minosity was so very low and in the 
low-energy long-wave part of the 
spectrum at that. They had even 
discovered that Lambda was not 
alone in space. Huge as it was, 
nearly two A.U. in diameter, it car- 
ried with it little orbiting fleas. The 
biggest of them was not much more 
than a mile through and the 
distance was still enormous, but the 
T’Worlie instruments had managed 
to detect them, even identify them. 
The longest periods of free-fall 
came when the T’-Worlie deployed 
their photon mirrors at the end of a 
tether, far from even the vibration 
of a footstep or shifting weight of 
robot mass in the ship — then their 
optical emulsions greedily drank up 
the scant flow of photons from 
Lambda and converted them into 
images. 

If they had had a great deal of 
time, they could have answered all 



questions from there, or nearly all. 
They were in intergalactic space, 
and there was no such thing as haze 
beyond the advance scattering of 
their own rocket ejecta. But they 
had no time — the delta-V equation 
still ruled them and one of its tricky 
parentheses said that deceleration 
early- was worth twice as much as 
deceleration late, since it gave them 
more time to slow down before they 
reached _ the neighborhood of 
Lambda. And then there was the 
mere fact of their rapid approach. 
The image did not remain still in 
the TWorlie mirrors. It grew. 
Minutely, to be sure, but enough so 
that an exposure for more than an 
hour or so began to fuzz. 

Even so, they learned. The 
nearest to pleasure Pertin ever 
found in a TWorlie was when a 
particularly fine series of 
photographs had been taken and it 
was found to show a hint, a shadow, 
finally an orbital line for the biggest 
of the objects that circled Lambda. 
The pleasure was spoiled for Pertin 
when the calculations of orbit and 
time turned out to be impossible; 
Lambda would have had to have 
the density of the solar wind to have 
such a slow satellite. ' But the 
TWorlie didn’t mind. Explana- 
tions would come. If not then, later.

darting about the ship, Pertin was 
nearly always bone-weary and 
aching. Sleep did not rest him. 
Communication with Sun One was 
more and more an effort. The 
twelve-hour wait between trans- 
mission and reply — often it was 
more, when the other beings on 
the ship had queued up for their 
own transmissions — destroyed the 
rhythm of communication. By the 
time he had a response to his report 
pf the attack on the instrument 
chamber he was already relaxing in 
his comforting awareness that the 
attack had not been repeated. Once 
he himself— or anyway that other 
self named Ben Charles Pertin— 
reported to him. The experience put 
Ben James Pertin into a tailspin 
that only a carefully metered dose 
of tranquilizers from the cocoon’s 
store could deal with. From the 
expression on the other Ben 
Pertin’s face, it was some strain for 
him, too. But the worst from Sun. 
One was not from his other self; it 
was from Gerald York Bielowitz, 
who acknowledged a report, sug- 
gested some additional instrument 
readings that would be desirable, 
started to sign off, hesitated and 
then added: “Oh, you’ll be 

interested, I think. Zara Doy and 
Ben Charles were married three 
hours ago.’’ 

Pertin did not remembef turning 
off the stereo stage or seeing the lit- 
tle figure collapse. He lay there for 
a long time while the cocoon 
stroked and soothed him, lifted 



him, lowered him, gently massaged 
what pains it could from his limbs. 
At some point he fell asleep. In his 
dream Ben Charles Pertin married 
Zara Doy, but he was Ben Charles 
and the two of them, intoxicated 
with the wine they drank and with 
each other, spoke sadly and wist- 
fully about the other Ben Pertin 
who was busy about the task of 
dying on an alien spaceship a 
galaxy away. When he woke up and 
remembered he was that other Ben 
Pertin he was in an instant un- 
focused rage. 

I T WAS Doc Chimp who woke 
him. “Hey, Boss,’’ he whined. 
“Listen, wake up. I’ve been limping 
around this hellhole of a ship 
looking for the Scorpian robot 
and—’’ 

“Shut up,” snarled Pertin 
through the outside communicator 
of his cocoon. His tone took the 
chimp aback. He slumped on his 
haunches, staring at Pertin’s 
cocoon. He was in bad shape, 
Pertin saw, unwilling to care about 
what he saw— the bright green 
plume was sagging under the thrust 
of the rockets, the paws and 
knuckles were scarred and stained. 
That was why he was there, of 
course — feet and paws. He could 
withstand the constantly varying G- 
force of the thrusters with only a 
good deal of pain, so it was his job 
to do what Pertin could not when he 
was bound to the cocoon. A part of 
Pertin’s brain told him that if he 



36 



IF 




tried he probably could find ways of 
making the job easier. 

The chimp’s expression abruptly 
>Vas no longer woebegone. It was 
angry. ‘‘Sure,” he said thickly, “I’ll 
shut up. Why not? We’ll all shut up 
before long. Dead beings are all 
pretty quiet.’’ 

Pertin fought to control his 
anger. “We’ll be dead all right. 
What difference does it make? Do 
you think this is a real life, what 
we’re doing here? Back on Sun One 
we’re alive and well — this is only a 
dream!’’ 

The chimp wailed, “Ben James', 
I’m tired and I hurt. I’m sorry if I 
said something wrong. Look, I’ll go 
away and come back, only — ’’ 

“Do that,” snapped Pertin, and 
turned off the outside com- 
municator. 

The agitated hairy face stared 
dolefully in at him. Doc Chimp was 
by no means a jungle primate. The 
shape of his skull was different. The 
structure of his respiratory system 
was different. The very chemicals 
that flowed in his blood were dif- 
ferent. But he was not human 
either. Doc Chimp — his formal 
name was not that, but it was all 
Pertin had ever called him — was 
one of the mutated animals that 
had been constructed for special 
purposes in the molecular biology 
plants on Earth. His quadridex- 
terous limbs made the ape par- 
ticularly useful even in free-fall, 
where he could fling himself about 
with perfect ease from toe-rest to 



hand-hold, while humans like 
Pertin clumsily sprawled and spun. 
But he had his drawbacks. 

A chimpanzee is simply not a 
human. His physiology is one count 
against him. He cannot develop the 
brain of a human because his skull 
is the wrong shape — and because 
the chemistry of his bl^od does not 
carry enough nourishment to meet 
the demands of abstract thought. 
He cannot fully master speech be- 
cause he lacks the physical equip- 
ment to form the wide variety of 
phonemes in human language. The 
molecular-biology people knew 
how to deal with that. They could 
do things like widening the angle of 
the cranium called the kyphosis, 
thus allowing the brain to round out 
full frontal lobes, or restructuring 
tongue and palate, even adding new 
serum components to the blood like 
the alpha 2 globulins that bind 
human hemoglobin. 

In practical terms what had been 
done to Doc Chimp and his siblings 
was to speed up evolution. But that 
was not quite enough. Two genera- 
tions back Doc Chimp’s ancestors 
could form only one or two of the 
simplest words and learn rote 
trljks — they lacked conceptual 
thought entirely. Doc Chimp had 
capacity. He did not have back- 
ground or tradition. His 600 ky- 
phosis was close to the human 
average so that his skull was 
domed — he possessed a forehead, 
could remember complicated 
instructions and perform difficult 



DOOMSHIP 



37 




tasks. He was capable of assimi- 
lating the equivalent of a trade- 
school education in skill and of 
conducting the equivalent of cock- 
tail-party conversation in perfor- 
mance. What he lacked was ego. 
His psychological profile was high 
in cyclothymia but also in ergic 
tension— he was always adven- 
turous and always afraid. His emo- 
tional index was about equal to a 
human five-year-old’s. Frightened, 
he ran. Angered, he struck out. Baf- 
fled, he wept. 

Staring back through the cover of 
the cocoon, Pertin relented. 
“Sorry,” he said, snapping the 
communicator back on. “What 
were you trying to tell me?” 

“I’ve lost the Scorpian,” wailed 
the chimp, 

“Well? Are you supposed to be 
his keeper?” 

“Be easy on me, Ben James,” 
begged the chimpanzee. “I hurt all 
over. The robot was supposed to be 
getting ready for some new instru- 
ments that were coming in. He isn’t 
there. The stuffs piling up in the 
transmission chamber and nobody 
to do anything about it. I’m afraid 
it’ll get damaged.” 

“What about what’s-her-name — 
Angel? Can’t she store it?” 

“She’s trying. But the Scorpian is 
a specialist in this stuff and she 
isn’t. None of the other high-G 
creatures is, as far as I can tell 
and — oh, Ben James, I’ve traveled 
so far trying to find someone who 
can help!” 



He was a pitiable sight, his fur 
.unpreened, his gay clothes smudged 
and wrinkled. Pertin said, “You’ve 
done your best. Doc. There is 
nothing I can do until the thrust 
stops — half an hour or so. Why 
don’t you rest up for a while?” 

“Thanks, Ben James!” cried the 
chimp gratefully. “I’ll just take a 
few minutes. Wake me, will you? 
I — I — ” But he was already 
clambering into the cocoon, his spi- 
derlike arms shaking with strain. 
Pertin lay back and closed his own 
eyes, allowing the cocoon to do its 
best, which amounted to increasing 
its rate of stroking his back 
muscles, trying mindlessly to calm 
him down. 

It had seemed very easy, back on 
Sun One, to volunteer for a task 
even though the end of it was his 
certain death. He had not counted 
on the fact that death did not come 
like the turning of a switch but 
slowly and with increasing pain — or 
that he would be watching friends 
die before him: 



H E DIDN’T wake the chimp 
when finally he could move. 
He thrust his own way to the 
tachyon transmission chamber, 
hurling himself down the corridors 
carelessly and almost slamming 
into what turned out to be the silver, 
pseudo-girl. He didn’t recognize the 
creature at first, for she had un- 
furled enormous silver-film wings 
and looked like a tinsel Christmas- 
tree angel as she rushed past him. 



38 



IF 




. In the tachyon chamber he found 
the TWorlie, Nimmie, supervising 
an octopoidal creature from one of 
the Core stars in transporting 
crated equipment to an empty 
chamber. “What’s happened? 
Where did Angel go? What’s this 
stuff?’’ Pertin demanded, all at 
once. 

Nimmie paused and hung in the 
air before him, balancing himself 
against stray currents of air with 
casual movements of his wings. He 
whistled a methodical answer and 
the Pmal translator converted it to 
his stately and precise form of 
speech in English: “Of those events 
which have occurred that which ap- 
pears most significant is the arrival 
of eight hundred mass units of 
observing equipment. A currently 
occurring event is that this equip- 
ment is in process of being in- 
stalled. A complicating event is that 
the Scorpian artificial-intelligence 
being has elected to engage his at- 
tention in other areas. There are 
other events but of lesser signifi- 
cance. The being you name Angel 
has gone to bring the Beta Bootis 
collective beings to assist in the 
aforesaid installation. The reason 
for this is that they are catalogued 
as possessing qualifications on this 
instrumentation similar to tjiat of 
the artificial-intelligence Scorpian. 
The precise nature of the stuff is 
tachyar observing equipment. I of- 
fer an additional observation — the 
purpose of it is to map and survey 
Object Lambda. I offer another ad- 



ditional observation — it will add to 
the radiation load by a factor of not 
less than three nor more than 
eight.’’ 

The T’Worlie hung silently in 
front of him, waiting for him to 
respond. 

It had a long wait. Pertin was 
trying to assimilate the information 
he had just received. A- factor of not 
less than three . 

That meant that his life expec- 
tancy was not a matter of months 
or weeks. It might only be days. 

Tachyar was simple enough in 
concept. It was like the ancient 
electromagnetic radar sets of 
Earth — the difference was that it 
used the faster-than-light tachyons 
to scan a distant object and return 
an echo of its shape and size. 

Like ancient radar and sonar, 
tachyar generated a beam and 
measured reflections. The problem 
in using tachyar was the magnitude 
of the beam. Vast energies were 
used and the fraction wasted be- 
cause of the natural inefficiency of 
the process produced ionizing 
radiation in large amplitudes. 

Sun One must be taking the 
question of Object Lambda’s 
satellites seriously if it was sending 
tachyar equipment to study them. 
The cost was high. It would be paid 
in the shortened lives of those 
aboardr 

T HE single planet of the golden- 
yellow star Beta Bootis was 
like a cooler, older Venus. Because 



DOOMSHIP 



39 




it was farther from its sun it was 
spared the huge flow of heat that 
cooked Venus sterile, but it 
possessed the same enormously 
deep, enormously dense at- 
mosphere. It was spared the loss of 
its liquid water and its surface was 
covered an average of thirty miles 
deep in an oceanic soup. That was 
where the Boaty Bits had evolved. 
Aquatic in origin, they could sur- 
vive on Sun One or the probe ship 
only in edited forms adapted for 
air-breathing— they could not live 
on high-gravity planets at all, since 
they had only the feeblest mech- 
anisms for propelling themselves 
about their native seas. An indi- 
vidual Boaty Bit was about as 
useful as an infant jellyfish, and 
not much more intelligent. That 
didn't matter. The Boaty Bits never 
operated as individuals. Their 
swarming instinct was over- 
powering and linked together they 
had a collective intelligence that 
was a direct function of their 
number. A quarter of a million 
Boaty Bits equaled a man. On their 
home planet they sometimes joined 
in collectives of four or five million 
t>r more, but those groupings could 
be maintained only briefly even in 
their oceans and were never at- 
tained in their air-breathing edited 
forms. 

When they arrived in the tachyon 
receiver chamber, they immediately 
took command. They were not spe- 
cialists in tachyar gear. They were 
generalists. The skills required to 



assemble and install the crated 
instruments were built into their 
collective intelligence. What they 
lacked was operating organs, but 
the T’Worlie, his octopoidal 
assistant, Ben James Pertin and 
every other being who came nearby 
were conscripted to be their hands 
and legs. 

It was slow work. It would have 
been impossible in a gravity field 
for the T’Worlie or even for Pertin 
himself. But in free-fall they were 
able to tug and guide the 
components into place and the 
T Worlie had mass enough to make 
the connections and calibrate the 
equipment. When they were nearly 
done Doc Chimp turned up, angry 
because he had been left behind, 
and his muscle finished the job 
quickly. 

As they were closing up, a blast 
of white sound came from the 
tachyon receiving chamber and 
warning lights flashed. Doc Chimp 
spun around, his wide jaw gaping. 
“Something important coming in?’’ 
he guessed. 

“I don’t know, but let’s go look.’’ 
They thrust themselves toward the 
chamber, got there just as the 
portal opened. 

Three Sheliaks emerged. 

They flashed out of the lock with 
a hollow hooting, long black shapes 
that rocketed toward the watching 
Terrestrials and bounced down on 
the green metal surface of the 
chamber. They clung in spite of the 
lack of gravity and flowed abruptly 



40 



IF 




into new shapes — black velvet 
globes, thigh high. 

Three more emerged— and three 
more. When Fifteen had come to 
rest on the floor of the chamber the 
transmission stopped. Without a 
detectable sign all of them moved in 
synchronization. From flattened 
spheres, like baker's buns set in a 
tray, they suddenly turned 
luminous, flowing with patterns of 
soft color,— then elongated 
themselves and stretched up 
tapered necks that rose as tall as a 
man. 

The tallest of them, the first 
through the chamber and the 
nearest to Ben James Pertin, made 
a noise like compressed gas 
escaping. 

Pertin’s Pmal unit translated: 
“Take notice. We are under the di- 
rection of the collective council of 
Sun One. We are to take command 
of this vessel and all other beings 
aboard are to follow our orders.” 

Pertin’s curiosity was suddenly 
transmuted into anger, a radiant 
rage that flooded his mind and 
overruled his inhibitions. “The hell 
you say! I’ve had no such instruc- 
tions from the Earth representa- 
tives and I deny your authority.” 

The Sheliak paused, the long 
neck swaying back and forth. 
“Your wishes are immaterial,” it 
stated at last. “We can destroy 
you.” 

Doc Chimp chattered nervously, 
“Don’t make him mad, Ben James. 
You know how Sheliaks are.” 



Pertin did; they were among the few 
races carrying built-in weaponry. 
On the infrequent occasions when 
the galaxy found itself troubled by 
unruly barbarians Sheliaks were 
employed to quiet the opposition — 
they were the Foreign Legion of the 
galaxy. 

The long neck swayed toward the 
mutated chimpanzee. From the 
narrow orifice at its tip, sound 
exploded again and the translators 
shouted at the chimp: “Your name. 
Your function. Reply at once.” 

“I am Napier Chimski, tech- 
nician,” the chimp replied bravely. 

The vase shape swung toward 
Pertin. “Your name and function.” 

“Oh, Ben James Pertin,” he said, 
distracted by hearing Doc Chimp’s 
real name for the first time. “I’m 
an engineer. But don’t go so fast. 
I’ve just come from Sun One myself 
and I know there’s no authority for 
one race to impose its will on 
another. I will certainly report this 
at once.” 

The Sheliak swayed silently for a 
moment — first toward him, then 
away. At last it said, “No orders 
for-you at present. Go about your 
business.” 

Pertin drew himself up, holding 
to a wall brace. “You’re my 
business,” he said. “There are mur- 
dering beings aboard this ship. If 
you’re here by order of Sun One* as 
you say, why don’t you go find 
them and leave us alone?” 

The Sheliak did not reply. All 
fifteen of them were swaying 



DOOMSHIP 



41 




silently now. Perhaps they were 
conferring with each other — She- 
liaks had learned vocal sounds only 
to talk to other races of the galaxy 
and the riddle of how they com- 
munciated among themselves was 
still unsolved. 

“I certainly will report this,” 
Pertin added. 

There was still no response. The 
pointless confrontation might 
have gone on, but it was interrupted 
by the bright thrice-repeated flash 
of white light that meant the 
thrusters were about to go into 
operation again. 

“Oh, hell,” groaned Pertin. 
“Doc, we’d better get back to our 
cocoons.” 

“Never too soon for me, Ben 
James,” agreed the chimp 
fervently, staring at the Sheliaks. 
“Let’s go.” 

Doc Chimp and Pertin raced for 
the cocoons. The warning had 
cauglit, others short. The corridors 
were full of low-G beings hurrying 
back to safety before the fusion 
rockets began again. The Boaty 
Bits arrowed along at top velocity, 
like a cartoon drawing of a swarm 
of wasps. An octopoidal creature 
launched itself from a wall off the 
end of the corridor with a multiple 
thrust of its legs and spun away, 
tentacles waving crazily. There was 
a thundering roar and three She- 
liaks raced off, then another three 
and another, in V formations. A 
being like a six-legged spider 
monkey bounced back and forth, 



scratching and clawing for 
footholds, whining irritably to itself 
in a high-pitched tone. 

And abruptly: “Ben James — 
look.” 

Doc Chimp was staring down a 
broad transverse corridor. Pertin 
saw a creature like an enormous 
blue eye, at least a foot across. It 
swerved as he looked, revealing the 
body behind the eye — a tapered tor- 
pedo shape glittering with 
patterned scales like blue glass. A 
stubby wing spread on each side, 
the leading edge thick and scaled 
and flowing smoothly into the 
body, the thin trailing edge a flutter 
of blue. Beyond the creature Pertin 
saw something bright, nfietallic and 
angular. 

“It’s the Sirian, Ben James. The 
one that tried to kill us all. And 
wasn’t that the Scorpian robot with 
him?” 

Pertin reached out, grabbed a 
handhold and checked himself. The 
chimpanzee reacted a moment later 
and also stopped himself a yard or 
two farther down. “What are you 
doing, Ben James?” 

“I’m going after them,” Pertin 
snapped. “The Sirian’s one of the 
murders. And the robot’s up to 
something, too.” 

“No, Ben James! You can’t take 
the G-force. Let’s let the Sheliaks 
take care of them — that’s what 
they’re here for.” 

The featureless green light of the 
corridor faded and changed to a 
dull crimson glow. That was the

short-term warning — less than 

thirty seconds remained before the 
rockets began. 

Pertin cursed. The chjmp was 
right, of course. 

“Oh, hell,” he groaned. “All 
right, let’s go — ”

) 

T 'HEY made it — not with any 
time to spare. They rolled into 
their cocoons as the first thrust 
struck and a moment later the 
regular repeated sound of the 
rockets reached them. The webbing 
spread itself over Pertin — he fell 
into the warm, receiving shape of 
the cocoon, but resisted its comfort. 
While it was still adjusting to his 
shape he was stabbing at the con- 
trols of the stereo stage, trying to 
summon all the cocoon-bound 
beings on the ship into conference. 
The automatic dialing circuits were 
equal to the job — the call was not 
something that was often made, but 
the physical capacity for such a 
conference existed. 

But not this time. All lines were 
busy. Every being on the ship, it ap- 
peared, was already using his stereo 
stage for purposes of his own — 
most likely frying to transmit a 
tachyon message to his own people 
at Sun One, Pertin knew. 

He fell back-and let the cocoon 
massage him. 

Thuuuuud-screech. Thuuuuuud - 
screech. The thrust felt more 
powerful than before, the tempo a 



bit faster. The thunder and groan of 
the drive made it nearly impossible 
for- Pertin to think, but he had to 
think. 

The problem on his mind was not 
one of the obvious ones — what to 
do about the Sheliaks, how to deal 
with the murderers, the completion 
of the mission. His mind worried at 
those a moment at a time and then 
let them go. They required action, 
not thought, and action was not 
available to him while the fusion 
rockets roared. 

Instead he thought about his un- 
pleasant discovery that there wasn’t 
much in being a hero. His heroism 
had been entered into lightly 
enough, but he supposed that was 
not in itself rare. How many Medal 
of Honor winners had volunteered 
for a combat patrol simply because 
they were bored with sitting in a 
foxhole — Ind had found themselves 
caught up in events that made them 
immortal reputations? 

But his heroism was hot even 
going to get him a medal. No one 
would ever really know what was 
happening on this ship, because it 
was absolutely certain there would 
be no survivors. Either Aurora’s 
mission would succeed — in which 
event the galaxy at large would ac- 
cept the crew’s sacrifice com- 
placently-+or it would fail. In the 
latter case the beings on board 
would all be thought of, when they 
were thought of at all, as that sorry 
bunch that wasted itself for 
nothing. 



DOOMSHIP

Ben James Pert in bounced about 
in his acceleration couch, trying to 
make terms with a double-bind. His 
was the first generation of men who 
knew that they could live — 
somehow — until they died of old 
age. This would be true even if they 
were run over by a truck or mur- 
dered by a lunatic. Ben Pertin 
might die, but Ben Pertin would 
live. 

Pertin and his fellow humans who 
had duplicated themselves for 
tachyon transmission were not im- 
mortal. They owned all the de- 
caying weaknesses of the flesh. 
Their brain cells grew fewer in 
number every day, like yours and 
mine. The collagen hardened in 
their tissues. The calcium migrated 
remorselessly from bone to blood 
vessel. 

They would die, each of them. 
But each one of them had the statis- 
tical certainty that not all of him 
would die prematurely. One Ben 
Pertin might die of cancer, another 
of pneumonia. One might succumb 
to an OD of the drugs that made 
these paradoxes briefly tolerable 
for some. Another might cut his 
throat. Another might perish point- 
lessly in an expendable job. But 
some Ben Pertin (who would al- 
ways be the Ben Pertin to himself, 
at least) would survive and throw 
off as many identical copies of 
himself as he wished or circum- 
stances required. 

It gave them a certain courage in 
the face of death. The personal in- 



volvement that every other 
generation of man had felt — the 
shrieking rage that when he went 
some irreplaceable part of the 
universe would be gone forever — 
was no longer there. They were not 
individually irreplaceable at all — 
they replaced themselves with 
tachyon copies. 

Nevertheless, when each of them 
died he felt that death as a death 
and saw it as the same grinning 
skull of fear that it had been for 
Adam. 

And when that death was close it 
was terrifying. 

With the thud and rasp of metal 
roaring at him, his cocoon 
seesawing in the violent decel- 
eration of the rockets, tired, sick, 
angry and hopeless, Ben James 
Pertin faced the fact that there was 
nothing left in his life anywhere that 
would give him one more moment’s 
joy. 



ANOTHER Ben Pertin, tens of 
thousands of light-years 
away, was trying to soothe his 
bride. He said, “Honey, I knew 
what I was getting into when I 
volunteered. I was willing to go 
through with it. That other me on 
the ship doesn’t feel any different 
about it.’’ 

Zara Pertin said harshly, “That 
other you is going to die, Ben 
Charles.’’ 

“But I’ll still be alive.’’ 

“And he’ll be dead. Don’t you 



44 



IF 




understand me? I love you. And he 
is you-^and I don’t like to think 
about what is happening to him.” 
She turned over, giving her back a 
chance to collect some of the UV 
tan from the lamps overhead, and 
took off her goggles. She said, 
“What’s it like there now, Ben?” 

“Well—” he said. 

“No, I want to know. Tell me.” 

Ben Charles looked around the 
simulated little beach beside the 
great water tank that was their 
“ocean.” No one else was near the 
spot — he and Zara had come here 
for that reason, but Ben Charles 
found himself wishing for an inter- 
ruption. She turned her head and 
looked at him and he shrugged. 

“All right. It’s bad,” he said. 
“The sensors in his acceleration 
cocoon already report some 
destruction of the white corpuscles. 
Pretty soon he’ll start having nose- 
bleeds — then he’ll bleed internally. 
He’ll be getting weaker, running a 
temperature. He has had more 
radiation than he can recover from 
and he keeps getting more. Before 
long he’ll die.” He paused, then 
answered his wife’s unspoken 
question: “He’ll probably go within 
a week.” 

Ben Charles propped himself up 
on one arm — an easy posture. Even 
here the effective gravity was only a 
negligible fraction of Earth-normal. 
He looked out at the thousand-foot 
cusp of water, curving upward to 
meet the bulkhead at the far end. 
Other water-tolerant beings were 



using the reservoir for their own 
equivalents of sport— it was a fa- 
vorite spot for such purposes. But 
none of the others were human. 

Ben Charles Pertin worried for a 
moment at the permanent problem 
of what he meant when he spoke of 
death. He came to several conclu- 
sions. The first was that it was 
spoiling his honeymoon. The 
second was that he did not feel as 
though he were dying — in spite of 
the fact that he knew that some 
light-years away he was doing just 
that — and even there loving Zara. 
The third was that he could not 
spend any more time on that par- 
ticular concern. The bad thing 
about dying, he reflected, was that 
you leave someone grieving — and 
Zara, he knew, was grieving. This 
brought him back to the question: 
who was dying? 

He looked at his wife. She was 
not weeping now, but she had been. 
The stain of drying tears lay at the 
corners of her eyes, 

“I’m sorry, honey,” he said. 

She shook her head without 
words. 

After a moment he made himself 
add: “It might not even be a week. 
Radiation alone will give him a few 
days, but there are plenty of other 
things on the probe that could kill 
him. Some of the beings are be- 
coming violent. The electronic ones 
are malfunctioning, because the 
radiation affects their synapses. 
They’re going insane, really. A lot 
of the organic ones are sick. All of 



DOOMSHIP 



45 




them are scared. There have been 
deaths. From violence.” 

“I should have gone with you,” 
Zara said thoughtfully. 

“Oh, now, really! That’s stupid! 
What would be the point?” 

“I would have felt better about 
it — and so would you. He.” She 
stood up, smiling, her mind made 
up. “If you have to go again, dear,” 
she said, “I’m going, too. Now I’m 
hungry. Race you back to the 
apartment!” 

VII 

T 'ACHYAR verified the paths 
of the little bodies orbiting 
Lambda — the mass estimates were 
right, thus the density estimates 
were right. Object Lambda’s 
average density was about that of a 
high vacuum. Nevertheless, it ap- 
peared to have a solid surface. 

Pertin greeted the news with 
apathy. There were more im- 
mediately important developments 
on the ship and the ultimate pur- 
pose for which the ship existed 
didn’t seem particularly interesting 
hriy more. 

For one thing, the tachyon trans- 
mission chamber was shut down. 
For better or for worse, there would 
be no more imports, no additional 
beings, no additions to the crew — 
nothing. 

The chamber’s last function had 
been to bring in freshly minted 
structural members and drive units. 
They were now being assembled 



into a small drone. It took form as 
a squat dense object, all fusion 
drive and instruments with no living 
space for a crew. It wpuld have no 
crew. It would carry, nothing but it- 
self and the tachyon receiving 
crystal that had been the Aurora’s. 

Pertin had no part in the 
construction project. The Boaty 
Bits directed it and the metal 
pseudo-girl and a few other high-G 
types carried it out. He looked in on 
it once or twice. Besides the 
structural part, brought in on the 
tachyon receiver, the small ship 
used bulkheads and beams from 
Aurora itself. It seemed to Ben 
James Pertin that vital parts of the 
parent ship were being seriously 
weakened. The fact interested him 
as an engineer. As a being whose 
life depended on the structural in- 
tegrity of the Aurora he didn’t 
consider any concern he felt worth 
mentioning. Whatever was hap- 
pening was planned. If the life of 
the Aurora was being shortened 
thereby, it was because the beings 
doing the planning had decided the 
ship was wholly expendable. 

The only non-expendable part of 
the Aurora now was the little drone 
being put together in its belly. 

The drone comprised only three 
elements: A tiny tachyon receiving 
unit — built around the crystal from 
Auroras own — in a globular body 
fitted with weak handling-propul- 
sors, suitable only for correcting 
minor errors in the elements of an 
orbit. A thick half-shell of metal- 



46 



IF 




bonded ceramics on one side, an ab- 
lation shield designed to flake and 
burn away, disposing of excess 
heat. And, outside the ablation 
shield, the enormous fusion-propul- 
sion engines. 

It was a high-deceleration drone. 
It would be launched from the 
mother ship at some point near Ob- 
ject Lambda. Its fusion jets would 
slow it radically. Stressed as it was, 
with no living creatures aboard, it 
could endure hundred-G delta-V 
forces. But Pertin’s engineer’s eye 
recognized the implications of the 
design. Even those forces would 
not be enough. The drone would 
make use of Object Lambda’s 
enormously deep atmosphere as 
well. It would dip into it, shedding 
velocity by burning it off as friction, 
blazing like a meteorite from its ab- 
lation surfaces. That frightful 
crunch would slow it to manageable 
relative speeds — as it came out of 
its first skip into Lambda’s air it 
would be close enough to orbital ve- 
locity for capture. Then its propul- 
sors could take over the simpler job 
of making neat the elements of the 
orbit — and a tachyon receiver 
would be in place around Object 
Lambda. 

What about the mother ship? 

The implications were clear to 
Pertin. All the evidence he needed 
was obvious in the construction of 
the probe. If such forces were 
needed to put the probe in orbit, 
there was no hope that Aurora 
could join it. Its kilotons of mass 



were simply too great for the forces 
available to deal with. Even if the 
forces were available its living 
cargo would be pulped by the delta- 
V. 

Aurora would drop its cargo, 
flash by Object Lambda and 
continue through intergalactic 
space. It would no longer have 
fusion mass for its reactors. It 
would stop decelerating — to all 
intents and purposes, it would be 
only another chunk of intergalactic 
debris on a pointless orbit to 
nowhere. 

Its course would continue to take 
it toward the galaxy itself. In time it 
would approach some of the in- 
habited worlds within mere light- 
years, perhaps. 

But that time would come too 
late to matter to anyone. It was a 
matter of thousands of years of 
travel time to even the fringe stars 
of the galaxy — and by then there 
would be little left of even the dust 
of its crew. 

They had been written off. 

M EANWHILE, the decelera- 
tion phases were getting 
longer, the zero-G pauses for 
observations shorter and less 
frequent. Sun One had lost interest 
in the observations that could be' 
conducted from Aurora. It was 
only waiting for the secondary 
probe to go into orbit. 

All through the ship, the living 
crew members were showing at- 
trition. They were weaker and less 



DOOMSHIP 



47 




rational, less capable of fine distinc- 
tions. The automatic machinery 
was running the ship. 

As it poured the last of its fuel 
reserves into space to brake its 
flight it manufactured enormous 
clouds of radioactive gas. They 
were not a hazard to the ship's 
crew — it was too late for such 
trivial affairs to matter to the 
doomed beings. But they had 
caused some concern to the plan- 
ners on Sun One. A thousand 
generations later they might be a 
pollution problem. But by then, no 
doubt, tachyon transport would it- 
self have been superseded and no 
one would any longer trouble with 
such primitive concerns as the 
crude STL transport of mass. 

The gas clouds as they departed 
did leave some trace of ionizing 
radiation, added to the larger incre- 
ments from the blasts themselves 
and from the tachyar. The 
combined radiation was a witches’ 
brew of gammas and alphas and 
betas— now and then primary parti- 
cles that coursed through the entire 
space of the ship from hull to hull 
struck an atomic nucleus and 
released a tiny, deadly shower of 
secondaries. 

It was the secondaries, the gam- 
mas, that did the dirty work. They 
interfered with the electronic func- 
tions of the computers, robots and 
metal beings. They damaged the 
instrumentation of the ship. Above 
all, they coursed through the or- 
ganic matter they encountered, 



knocking out an electron here, 
loosening a molecular bond' there, 
damaging a cell nucleus, making a 
blood vessel more permeable. The 
whole organic crew was on hourly 
doses of antirads, giving support to 
their internal workings. It was not 
enough. Still the radiation soaked 
in and struck at them. Blood, ichor, 
sap or stew of exotic biologies, the 
fluids that circulated in their bodies 
changed and grew less capable of 
supporting life. Physically they 
grew weaker. Mentally they be- 
came cloudy. 

Taken out of the environment 
and rushed to an anti-rad clinic — 
like victims of an industrial acci- 
dent — many of them still could 
have been saved. 

But there was no place to take 
them. No part of the ship was free 
of penetrating ionizing radiation 
and every hour more and more of 
the chemistry of their bodies was 
damaged. 

«X»EN JAMES, BEN 

-DjAMES,” sobbed the voice 
of Doc Chimp. 

Pertin roused himself. The thud 
and screech of the drive was still 
loud in his ear. Every time the floor 
drove up to meet the cocoon the 
single huge bruise his body had be- 
come screamed with pain. Inside 
his chest his lungs felt as though 
they had broken loose and were 
beaten sore against the inside of his 
rib cage. 

He peered Wearily out of the 



48 



IF 




cocoon. The chimp was staring 
pathetically up at him. The great 
green plume of his hat was broken. 
His fur was splotched with dirt and 
blood. The rubbery features of his 
face looked almost as they always 
had, except for an open cut along 
the flat, sculptured nose. 

“What?” demanded Pertin 
thickly. 

“I have to hide, Ben James. The 
Sheliaks are after me.” 

Pertin tried to sit up and could 
not. “They’re not here to hurt 
you,” he pointed out. 

The chimp- whimpered, bobbing 
on all four limbs as he braced 
himself against the rocket thrust. 
“They will! They’re mad, Ben 
James. They killed the T’Worlie. 
For nothing— just killed him. And 
they almost killed me.” 

“What were you doing?” 

“Nothing! Well, I— I was 
watching their mating ritual. But 
that wasn’t it — ” 

“You idiot,” groaned Pertin. 
“Look, can you climb in here with 
me?” 

“No, Ben James, I don’t have the 
strength.” 

“It’s either that or let them catch 
you.” 

The chimpanzee whimpered in 
fear. Then abruptly, on the upsurge 
of the ship against its shock 
absorbers, sprang to the side of the 
cocoon. Pertin grabbed at him and 
pulled him inside just as the next 
thrust caught them. Doc Chimp 
weighed some two hundred pounds 



at Earth’s surface. The delta-V 
gave him a momentary weight of 
nearly half a ton, all concentrated 
on Pertin’s shoulder and chest. He 
grunted explosively. The chimp was 
caught with part of his side still 
across the metal lip of the cocoon, 
but he made no sound beyond the 
steady sotto-voce mumble of fear. 

Pertin tried to make room behind 
him, in a place where the cocoon 
had never been designed to take a 
load. It tried its mechanical best to 
give support to the double mass. It 
was not adequate to the job. Pertin 
discovered when the next thrust 
came that his arm was still caught 
under the chimp. He helped, 
managed to free it on the upsurge, 
discovered it was not broken. He 
slammed down the privacy curtain, 
hoping the Sheliaks would not look 
inside if they came. 

“Now,” he panted, “what did 
you say about Nimmie?” 

“He’s dead, Ben James. They* 
killed him. I didn’t mean any 
harm,” the chimp sobbed. “You 
know how the Sheliaks re- 
produce — by budding, like ter- 
restrial plants. The young ones 
sprout out of the old ones and grow 
until they’re mature enough to be 
detached.” 

“I know.” Pertin had only the 
vaguest acquaintance with She- 
liaks, but everybody knew that 
much. They didn’t have^sexes, but 
their conjugation provided a union 
that shuffled up the genes. 

“Well, that didn’t look like fun to 



DOOMSHIP 



49 




me, but I wanted to see. Nimmie 
told me to go away. He couldn’t — 
he was in one of the spare cocoons, 
and couldn’t move. But he said 
they’d be mad.” The chimp 
switched his position and Pertin 
shouted in pain as his upper thigh 
took part of the chimp’s weight on 
a rocket thrust. “Sorry, Ben James. 
It was disgusting, the way they did 
it! Any two of them can get the 
urge. They sort of melt down and 
flow together like jelly. All the body 
cells migrate, pair off and fuse. Fi- 
nally they form again into a sort of 
cactus-shaped vegetable thing that 
buds off haploid, mobile creatures. 
Those are the Sheliaks we see.” 

“You wanted to watch that?” 
asked Pertin, almost able to laugh 
in spite of discomfort, in spite of 
Nimmie, in spite of everything. 

“Yes, Ben James. Just for 
curiosity. And then there’s my 
friend. Fireball. He’s the Sheliaic 
who was here all along. He was 
nice, Ben James. 1 miss him.” 

“I didn’t know you knew any 
Sheliaks.” 

“Not well. But he was with me, 
helping to guard all of you. And we 
talked.” 

“You sound as if he’s dead, too.” 

“Might as well be. That union is 
a sort of individual suicide. It’s 
something you do for the race and 
because your glands push you that 
way. But it’s the end for the indi- 
vidual. It wipes out all conscious 
memory and individual personality. 
I guess that’s why Fireball couldn’t 



understand our notions of sex. 

“Anyway,” he said, “it was all 
right while Fireball was here alone. 
He wasn’t lonely; or anyway, he 
didn’t want any other Sheliaks 
around. When they’re in danger, 
you see, they just can’t help 
conjugating. It’s a survival 
mechanism. The radiation was 
danger, and he knew that the only 
way for him to keep alive was to 
stay away from his own people. 
When the new ones came aboard he 
was actually afraid of them. He 
knew when they came close they 
were likely to set off a biological 
process they couldn’t control. And 
when it was over — ” 

The chimp swallowed. He thrust 
himself up on an elbow, regardless 
of pain, and stared into Pertin’s 
eyes. 

“He didn’t know me, Ben James! 
The two new ones that were half 
him, they came after me. The 
T’Worlie saw what was happening 
and tried to stop them — and that’s 
how I got away, while they were 
killing him. So I ran. But where is 
there to run to in this ship?” 

W 'HEN they could move again 
they found the T’Worlie 
easily enough. He was floating up- 
side down, purplish drops of blood, 
perfectly round, floating beside 
him. The little vibrissae around his 
sphincter mouth, more like cat’s 
whiskers than anything on a proper 
earthly bat, were perfectly still. 
Nimmie was rigid. The pattern of 



50 



IF 




five eyes was unmoving. The intri- 
cate pattern of blotches of color on 
his filmy wings was fading,. 

There was no one else around. 
“What’ll we do with him, Ben 
James?** chattered the chimp. 

“Throw him out into space, I 
guess,’’ Pertin said harshly. Nor- 
mally the mass would Be useful in 
the tachyon receiver, but there were 
to be no more incoming tachyon 
transmissions. 

It didn’t do to think of that. He 
stared at the TWorlie. A slow 
incrustation of a thick gel was mat- 
ting the fluffy surface of Nimmie’s 
chest, and where it had once pro- 
truded sharply, like a bird’s 
wishbone, it was crushed and con- 
cave. 

Pertin felt the muscles on his face 
drawing taut, perhaps partly be- 
cause of the intense vinegar reek. 
He said, “Why would the. Sheliaks 
break up equipment?” 

The chimpanzee stared at the 
mess in the room. Bright green and 
orange transistors and microchips 
were scattered like jigsaw pieces in 
the air. “I don’t know, Ben James! 
None of that was that way when I 
ran out of here. Do you suppose 
they just lost their temper?” 
“Sheliaks don’t lose their temper 
that way. They broke up instru- 
ments on purpose. What was 
coming in before you decided to 
play Peeping Tom?” 

“Oh — ” The chimp thought. 
“More reports on Object Lambda. 
The density was confirmed. Very 



low. Like a sparse cloud of 
interstellar gas.” 

“We already knew it was Cloud- 
Cuckoo Land. That couldn’t have 
had any effect on them.” 

“Something did, Ben James,” 
cried the chimp. “Look, we’ve got 
to do something. They’ll be looking 
for me, and — ” 

“Unless,” said Pertin thought- 
fully, “it wasn’t the Sheliaks who 
did it. The robot was. up to some- 
thing. And there are still a couple of 
Purchased People not accounted 
for me, and—” 

“Too late!” howled the chimp. 
“Listen, Ben James! Somebody’s 
coming!” 

B UT it wasn’t the Sheliaks who 
'came in on . them — it was 
Angel, the silver pseudo-girl, the 
heavy-planet creature in human 
form. Her fingers were. outstretched 
toward them, listening, as her great 
foil wings drove her forward. 

Behind her came the Scorpian 
robot. 

They made an eerie pair, the 
striking orange-eyed girl with her 
coif of metallic hair and steel-bright 
body hues and the mechanical 
creature shaped like a metal oc- 
topus. Its central body was a 
massive disk, the color of the 
pseudo-girl’s flesh, and its silvery 
tentacles made a fringe of snakes, 
around it. A greenish membrane 
that bulged above the upper surface 
of the disk fluttered, producing a 
drum-roll of sound. 



DOOMSHIP

Pertin’s Pmal translator obedi- 
ently turned it into recognizable 
words: “Do not resist. We wish you 
to come with us.” 

“Where?” he demanded. 

There was no answer, at least not 
in words. Pertin was caught in 
something like a metal whip that 
stung a trail of fire around his 
waist. It was one of the robot’s 
tentacles. It pinned his arms and 
the pseudo-girl launched herself at 
him, her metal fist catching him full 
in the face. Floating as he was, the 
blow was robbed of some of its 
force, but it doubled him, flung him 
back against the robot’s lash, dazed 
with pain and sobbing for breath. 

He heard a cry of anguish from 
Doc Chimp, but could not turn to 
see what was happening. The 
vinegary smell of the dead T’ Worlie 
penetrated his nostrils, mixing with 
the tang of his own blood. 

“Why?” he croaked, and tried to 
raise his arms to defend himself as 
the girl dropped toward him again. 
She did not answer. She was on him 
like a great silvery bat, metal feet 
kicking, shining fists flying. The 
lights went out. He lost touch with 
space and time. 

Pertin was not wholly uncon- 
scious, but he was so close to it, so 
filled with pain and confusion, that 
he could hardiy remember what 
happened next. He had a fugitive 
impression of great shapes whirling 
around him, then of being carried 
away while someone behind him 
sobbed his name, the voice 



diminishing slowly in the distance. 

Much later he opened his eyes. 

He w4s alone in a part of the ship 
he knew only sketchily. A large 
open cocoon hung from a wall and 
inside it was what looked like one 
of the Purchased People. Pertin’s 
face was swollen and his eyes were 
not focusing well at all — he 
squinted, but could not make out 
the features on the person in the 
cocoon. It appeared to be male, 
however, and it appeared to be in 
the last stages of dissolution. 

It moved and looked toward him. 
A caricature of a smile disturbed 
the weeks-old beard and the dry 
tongue licked the lips. A cracked 
voice muttered something, the tone 
hoarse and indistinguishable. 

“Who are you? What do you 
want?” demanded Ben James 
Pertin. 

The figure rasped a sort of 
hacking cough, that perhaps was 
meant for a chuckle. It tried again 
and this time its words came clear 
enough — clear and familiar in a 
way Pertin had not expected. 

“I want to talk to you, Ben,” it 
croaked. “We have a lot in com- 
mon, you know.’’ 

Pertin frowned, then his swollen 
eyes widened. He pushed himself 
toward the swathed figure, caught 
himself at the lip of the cocoon and 
stared down. 

The eyes that looked up at him 
were pain-filled but familiar. He 
was looking into his own, battered, 
obviously dying face.

VIII 

F ^ERTIN remembered a time — 
months ago. 

He had gone to the tachyon 
transmitter and light-heartedly 
enough given his blueprint to the 
scanners and allowed one self of 
him to be beamed to the Aurora. It 
had not seemed like an important 
thing to do. At that time it had not 
been clear to him that the Aurora 
was a doomed ship. At that time he 
had had no one to consult but 
himself — Zara Doy had still been 
only a casual acquaintance, a new 
girl from Earth with a pretty face. 
“Ben Frank,” he whispered. 
“Right as rain,” croaked the 
ghastly voice. “And I know about 
you. You’re Ben James Pertin and 
you’ve been aboard two weeks now. 
Not very thoughtful of you, failing 
to visit a dying relative.” 

“But I thought you were already 
dead! They said — I mean, I 
wouldn’t have had to come, if—” 
“Blaming me, Ben James? Well, 
why shouldn’t you? How long have 
I lain here blaming you — and me — 
and all the Ben Pertins there ever 
were.” A spasm of coughing racked 
him, but he talked right through it. 
“I wanted them to think I was 
dead. Only fair, isn’t it? They were 
killing me— and now I’ve killed 
their Project Lambda.” 

“You?” 

“With a lot of help. My Sirian 
friends were the first and best, but 
there have been plenty since. It was 



the Sirians who told me you were 
aboard— you gave one of them 
quite a start when he saw you in the 
instrument room. Wrecked his 
mission, you did.” 

Coughing drowned out the voice. 
Ben Frank convulsively clutched at 
the cocoon monitor controls. A 
warning panel lit over the bed. He 
was very near death, but the cocoon 
was not yet defeated — it metered 
colored fluids into the external 
blood supply that was trying to re- 
place the destroyed blood cells. 

“I only have a few minutes,” Ben 
Frank Pertin gasped. “I don’t 
mind. But I’m not finished, Ben 
James. You have to finish for me. 
Destroy that probe. I don’t want it 
to succeed. I don’t want Sun One to 
get its orbiting body around Object 
Lambda.” 

“But then we — we’ll all have died 
in vain!” 

“Of course it’s in vain. What’s 
the sense of all this? A chunk of 
useless matter — thousands of light- 
years from anywhere — going 

nowhere. Project Lambda! Do you 
know how many lives it has cost? I 
want you to wreck it for me, Ben 
James, so those fools on Sun One 
will know better than to try this 
same stunt another time — ” 

“But it’s not a stunt,” objected 
Ben James Pertin. “It’s important. 
That object is something special, 
solid but like a cloud — ” 

“Cloud-Cuckoo Land! It’s not 
worth a single life. Anyway, it’s 
done already, Ben James. My 



DOOMSHIP 



53 




friends are wrecking the probe right 
now. I only called you here 
because — ” 

He paused, coughing terribly. 
The face that was so much like Ben 
James’s own was aged with the 
weary agony of radiation death. 

“Because," he gasped, “I want 
some part of me to stay alive. If you 
keep the tachyon receiver you can 
live, Ben James. Weeks— maybe 
months! But once it goes there will 
be no more food, no more air, no 
more fuel. 1 want — ” 

But what he wanted to say at the 
last Ben James Pertin would never 
know. His duplicate suddenly 
gasped for breath, made a stran- 
. gling sound and was still. 

After a moment Ben James 
pulled the privacy screen over the 
face that was his own and turned to 
leave. 

Halfway to the launch chamber 
he ran into the Sheliaks. 

T HEY were in pursuit of two 
beings, one of them the 
Purchased People woman, the 
other Doc Chimp. The Sheliaks 
looked strange and in a moment 
Pertin realized why. They were 
smaller than they had been. 
Essentially they were children now, 
some of their mass lost when they 
budded. But their behavior was 
childish only in jts reckless dis- 
regard for consequences. As far as 
their quarry was concerned, it was 
lethal. 

Pertin did not pause to speculate 



on issues. Doc Chimp was in danger 
and Ben dove to the rescue. 

He collided with one of the She- 
liaks. It was like tackling a six-foot 
lump of chilled, damp dough. No 
bones, no cushioning fat, just a 
great dense mass of muscular fiber. 
The Sheliak automatically cupped 
around him and, linked, they went 
flying into the wall. The corridor 
spun around him, a nightmare of 
blue-green light and red-black 
shadow and corpse-colored beings. 

“Stop!” roared Pertin. “Wait- 
listen to me — ” But no one wanted 
to talk. They were all on him, 
thrusting, striking, crushing, using 
whatever offensive capacities their 
mobile anatomies gave them. He 
fought back, using skills he had 
never known he had. His hands 
were black and slippery with blood, 
no doubt much of it his own. 
Bravely the woman and Doc Chimp 
had turned back to fight, but it was 
three of them against more than a 
dozen Sheliaks and the issue was 
not in doubt. 

What saved them was Angel, the 
silver pseudo-girl. Her carven face 
remote as a statue’s, she drove 
toward them with great sweeps of 
her wings. Coronas of electrostatic 
fire haloed her fingers and 
wingtips— something gun-shaped 

and deadly was in her hands. The 
Sheliaks, all at once and in unison, 
turned to meet her. The gun-shaped 
thing hissed and a white jet 
crackled toward them. It passed 
near enough to Pertin for him to 



54 



IF 




feel a breath of icy death, but it did 
not strike him. It grazed the She- 
liak who held him and at once the 
being stiffened and began to drift. 
Behind them, where the jet had 
struck, the wall became hidden 
under a broad patch of glittering 
frost. A cloud of white vapor 
billowed around it. 

In the haze Pertin caught sight of 
Doc Chimp and the Purchased 
People woman, momentarily 
forgotten as the Sheliaks turned 
against the stronger foe. The 
woman was badly hurt. Doc Chimp 
was helping her, his hairy face 
turned fearfully toward the She- 
liaks. Pertin joined them and the 
three of them moved inconspic- 
uously away. 

When they were two corridors 
away and the sounds of battle had 
diminished they paused and in- 
spected their injuries. Pertin 
himself had only added a few 
bruises to a total that was already 
too large to worry about. The 
chimp was even more battered, but 
still operational. The woman was 
worse off. She was bleeding 
profusely from a gash on the upper 
arm. Her face was grotesquely puf- 
fed, both eyes were blackened and 
one leg was bent at an angle ana- 
tomically impossible to a whole 
bone. But she did not appear to feel 
pain. 

When Pertin spoke to her, she 
answered in English, “They don’t 
consider it important. It will not 
prevent moving about and 



performing necessary functions.” 

Doc Chimp was groaning and 
sobbing in pain. “Those Sheliaks!” 
he cried, feebly trying to groom his 
matted fur. “They’re wholly out of 
control, Ben James. They tried 
again to wreck the probe — may 
have done it by now if they’ve got 
enough power of concentration to 
remember what they were doing 
when we diverted their attention. 
And if Angel hasn’t killed them 
all.” 

Pertin said with a confidence 
he didn’t feel, “She’ll stop them. 
As long as we’ve got her on our 
side — ” v 

“On our side?” cried Doc Chimp. 
“Ben James, you don’t know what 
you’re saying. She’s worse than 
they are!” 

“But she tried to rescue you.” 

The Purchased woman said 
calmly, “That is wrong. She merely 
wanted to kill the Sheliaks.” 

“That’s right, Ben James. She’s 
against all organic beings now. 
She’s not ionizable, you see. Radia- 
tion doesn’t bother her. The only 
thing that can kill her is deprivation 
of energy sources and that means 
the tachyon receiver. Once it’s gone 
she will die as soon as the fuel runs 
out.” 

Pertin said slowly, “Is it the same 
with the Scorpian robot?” 

The battered face nodded, the 
stub of the green plume jerking 
wildly. 

Pertin said, “that means we have 
to assume all nonorganic beings 



DOOMSHIP 



55 




will feel the same and try Td prevent 
the launch. What about the other 
organics?” 

The Purchased woman recited 
emotionlessly: “The T’Worlie, all 
dead. Boaty Bits, more than half 
destroyed — the remainder too few 
to make a collective entity in- 
telligent enough to matter. Sirians 
and Core Stars races not observed 
in recent hours and must be pre- 
sumed dead or neutralized. She- 
liaks, destructive and purposeless.” 

Pertin absorbed the information 
without shock, without reaction of 
any kind other than a strange im- 
pulse to laugh. “But — but whom 
does that leave to see that the 
launch occurs?” 

“Nobody!” cried Doc Chimp. 
“Nobody at all, Ben James — ex- 
cept us!” 



T HEY reached the launch 
chamber ahead of the Shetiaks 
after all. No one else was there. 

The capsule, tiny bright tachyon 
crystal at its heart, lay silent and 
unmoving, connected to the main 
bulk of the ship by only a canopy 
designed to be jettisoned. Destruc- 
tion had raged all around it, but it 
was still intact. 

Less than an hour remained until 
launch. 

“We’ll build barricades,” said 
Pertin. “Anything. Those wrecked 
instrument boards — the spare 
plates and braces. Whatever we can 
move we’ll pile against the en- 



trance. All we have to do is delay 
them — ” 

But they had barely begun when 
brightness glinted in the approach 
corridor and the silvery pseudo-girl 
came toward them, followed by the 
tumbling form of the Scorpian 
robot. They-brought up short at the 
entrance, the robot with one slim 
tentacle coiled caressingly around 
the silver girl. 

Pertin put his weight behind the 
channel iron he had been about to 
emplace at the door and launched it 
toward the pair. The pseudo-girl 
made a sound that was partly 
laughter and partly the singing of a 
single piercing note and ihe Scor- 
pian uncoiled a long silver sting. 
The sting reached out and touched 
Pertin. A blinding light stabbed 
from it, jolting him with a strong 
electric shock. 

The girl glided in, spreading her 
tattered wings. The stirred air 
bathed him in her strong scent, 
ether-sweet, with undertones like 
the pits of peaches. Pertin searched 
the bright silvery face and found no 
expression. It was no more human 
than a doll’s. The Scorpian’s silver 
tentacles thrust away the pitiful 
obstructions, making a sound like 
an enormous gong which Pettin’s 
Pmal refused to translate. 

The Purchased woman in- 
tervened, hurling herself toward the 
robot, and was brushed heedlessly 
aside. She struck against the side of 
the probe ship, a blow that must 
have been agony to her human 



56 



IF 




nervous system, but she did not cry 
out. Awkwardly she tried to project 
herself again into the fight. Pertin 
forced himself to join her. 

A bird-like trilling from outside 
indicated that others were coming, 
and behind the great winged hulk of 
the pseudo-girl Pertin could see 
black shadow-shapes moving 
across the dimly lighted shaft, 
growing rapidly as they 
approached. 

“Oh, no!” moaned Doc Chimp. 
“Sheliaks and a Sirian!” 

The robot was not deflected from 
its single-minded purpose. It 
floated toward Pertin, green dome 
pulsing. An elongating tentacle 
struck out at Pertin like an endless 
silver snake, not to sting this time 
but to snare. It wrapped him in 
slick, chill coils. He fought free, 
was caught again — and at last the 
Scorpian turned to confront the 
other beings. It arched its stinging 
jet, but held it poised, waiting. 

The Sirian was first into the 
launch chamber, a tapered, blue- 
scaled torpedo shape fifteen feet 
long, all pliant wing and shining 
eye. With a ripple of trailing wing 
edges it flashed at the Scorpian. 

The sting coiled, jetting white 
light into the wide blue eye. The 
Sirian was not defenseless — its own 
forces gathered the robot’s charge 
and repelled it, sending the jet back 
at the robot, reinforced and mul- 
tiplied. 

The pseudo-girl turned with great 
strokes of her wings, her three-fin- 



gered hand coming up with the gun- 
shaped weapon that had killed She- 
liaks. Desperately Pertin twisted to 
intercept her. Her wings were sadly 
battered now, but still gave her su- 
perior mobility; he missed her on 
the first try and crashed against a 
wall. Half blinded by his own 
blood, he doubled his legs under 
him and launched himself at her 
again. 

The gun-shaped thing swung to 
meet him and the white jet hissed at 
him. He heard a brittle crackling 
sound in the air and felt the breath 
of icy death. 

But the jet had missed and he was 
on her. With one hand he swung at 
her wrist. It was like striking a 
crowbar with his bare hand, but it 
jarred the weapon loose; and just 
then the battle between Scorpian 
and Sirian reached its climax. 

The Sirian’s jet struck a vital 
place in the great green dome of the 
robot. It exploded. The mellow 
booming sound the robot made be- 
came a hollow jangle. The tentacles 
writhed and recoiled. It sprawled in 
the air, a grotesque huddle of tor- 
tured metal, spilling green fire and 
drops of an acid that sizzled and 
burned where they struck. 

If the robot had known life, that 
life was gone — it was dead. 

The silvery girl abandoned the 
fight with Pertin. With a great 
stroke of her wings she propelled 
herself to it, hovered over it, wailing 
an unearthly sound. 

And the great blue eye of the 



DOOMSHIP 



57 




Sirian turned toward Pertin. Be- 
hind it the Sheliaks, late on the 
scene but ready for battle, were 
elongating their wrinkled necks 
toward him. 

F )ERTIN cried desperately: 

“Wait! They — they were mis- 
leading you. They were trying to 
prevent the launch, to save their 
own lives — ” 

The eye hesitated. 

“We’re de^d already,” he 
croaked. “Nothing can help us 
now, not any organic creature. The 
radiation will kill us before long, 
even the Sheliaks. But the robot 
and the girl — ” 

He could hear his voice hissing or 
singing out of the aliens’ Pmals. 

“The robot,” he repeated, “and 
the altered copy that looks like a 
terrestrial female — they weren’t 
radiation-vulnerable. They could go 
on indefinitely. But the rest of us — 
if we let them succeed in stopping 
the launch, then we all die for 
nothing!” 

The eye paused, irresolute. 

Then the foremost of the Sheliaks 
cried: “Fool! We, too, are not 
radiation-vulnerable! We simply 
n$ed to conjugate and be born 
again. But we must have the 
tachyon receiver — and if you try to 
keep us from it you must die!” 

The three tapered tear-drop 
shapes, like a school of sharks in 
formation, plunged toward Pertin. 
The Sirian eye irresolutely turned 
toward them — then, with decision, 



the being whirled to confront them. 

Contemptuously the Sheliaks 
changed course to meet it. The 
leading One widened a ruff of flesh 
to act like an instant air-brake. It 
stopped in the air, flowed with a 
dazzle of color, narrowed a neck 
toward the Sirian eye. 

The thin neck spat a stream of a 
yellow fluid. It struck the Sirian eye 
and clung, acid, adhesive, ago- 
nizing. The Sirian made an 
unearthly wailing noise at the sud- 
den pain of the attack against which 
it had no built-in defenses. The 
great blue eye turned milky white; 
the huge body knotted in agony. 

But it still had strength to fire a 
jet of energy that caught all three 
Sheliaks. They died instantly, but 
the effort was the last for the 
Sirian. All its stored energy had 
gone into that pulse. The reflected 
cascade of burning energy came 
bouncing back, bathing the silvery 
girl and sending her reeling sound- 
lessly into a wall, to flop into an un- 
gainly, contorted mass that didn’t 
move. Pertin was farther away and 
partly shielded by what was left of 
the robot — even so the bolt lanced 
his skin with pain. 

But he was alive. 

Slowly and painfully he caught a 
hold-fast on the wall, steadied 
himself while he looked around. 

The Purchased People woman 
was dead, either bled empty or 
caught in that last furious bolt. The 
Sirian eye floated broken and 
aimless. The robot was destroyed. 



58 



IF 




The pseudo-girl was drifting im- 
potently away. The Sheliaks were 
cinders. 

The chamber was filled with the 
stench of many different kinds of 
death, but Pertin was still alive. 

Suddenly remembering, he cried, 
“Doc Chimp!” 

The ape was out of sight. Fu- 
riously Pertin ransacked the 
chamber and found him at the last, 
wedged between the wall of the 
probe and the ship’s canopy, not 
quite dead but unconscious. 

Pertin looked down at him sadly 
and affectionately. It was nearly 
time to launch the probe and the 
question in Pertin’s mind was: was 
it better to wake him up or to let 
him sleep as the probe was 
launched, the canopy jettisoned and 
all the air in the chamber puffed 
instantly and murderously away 
into space? 

The answer was taken out of his 
hands as the ape stirred, moaned 
softly and opened his eyes. He 
looked up at Ben James Pertin and 
said thickly, “The probe?” 

“It’s all right,” said Pertin. 
“We’ll have to launch it by hand.” 

“When, Ben James?” 

Pertin checked the time. “Just a 
few minutes now,” he said. 

The ape grinned painfully. 
“That’s good to know, Ben James,” 
he said. “No more problems. No 
more aches and pains. I always 
thought I’d be afraid of dying, but, 
you know? To tell you the truth, 
I’m kind of looking forward to it.” 



T >HE process that animated the 
body of the silvery pseudo-girl 
was more like electrophoresis than 
chemistry, but it was vulnerable to 
attack. It was damaged now. 

But she was not dead. The great 
wings were broken and useless, but 
her limbs still moved, the inappro- 
priate angel face still held its bleak, 
proud expression. 

She was in great pain. That is to 
say that all of the sensory nets of 
her edited body were transmitting 
messages of malfunction, damage 
and warning. She did not perceive 
them as a human perceives a 
toothache, a sensation so blinding 
that it can lead to suicide, but they 
did interfere with the few pleasure- 
bound processes left to her — re- 
miniscence, forevision, contem- 
plation. In the sense that these in- 
terfering messages were pain, she 
had experienced pain from the 
moment she floated out of the 
tachyon receiver on Aurora. All 
edited members of her race did. 
There was no way to rearrange 
their structures into forms viable in 
atmosphere and low-G that- was 
comfortable for them. 

Time was when Angel had 
experienced pain only infrequently, 
and in ways that were soon mended. 
Time was when she had lain with 
her sisters in the icy methane slush 
of her native planet, absorbing 
energy from the radioactive ele- 
ments that swam about them, 
growing, learning from the tutorials 
of her ortho-father, competing in 



DOOMSHIP 



59 




the endless elimination battles of 
her race that finally won her the 
choice of assignments — and ulti- 
mately led her to the Aurora and its 
imminent doom. Her race was not 
greatly interested in astronomy. 
They had known almost nothing of 
it until the first T’Worlie probe 
survived the crushing pressures of 
their atmosphere and brought them 
into contact. From the surface of 
their enormous planet, there were 
no stars to be seen. Even their air- 
craft never reached an altitude be- 
yond dense yellow-gray clouds. 

What brought her to Aurora was 
the trait that her whole upbringing 
had trained into her: the com- 
petitive need to go farther and do 
more. It was not goal-oriented. It 
gained nothing from victories ex- 
cept the opportunity for further vic- 
tories. The only victory now open 
to Angel was to survive — and the 
only way to do it was by preventing 
the launching of the probe. 

She calculated she had strength 
enough left to destroy the two or- 
ganic creatures in her way — but 
only just. And only if she acted 
now. 

I T WAS Pertin who saw her first, 
his hand frozen on the release 
lever. It was Doc Chimp who acted. 
He flung himself on the pseudo-girl. 

“Hurry up, Ben James!” he 
shouted. “She’s too strong for 
me—” His voice stopped, 
punctuated by a screech of pain as 
the silvery arm thrust him away like 



a cannon shot. The mutated chimp 
went flying into the floating 
wreckage of the Scorpian robot. 
The soft, frail dome of the skull, so 
cleverly mutated into the near- 
shape of man’s own, impaled itself 
on a steel shard and the thoughtful, 
considering brain was destroyed. 

Pertin hardly even saw it happen. 
He was past the point for sorrow. It 
would be easy to let the pseudo-girl 
destroy him. At least one life would 
be saved — hers. His no longer 
counted. He could hope for a few 
days, a week or two at the most, of 
being able to move and breathe. 
And what would it be like? 
Increasing pain. Hopeless fear. 
Regret. Envy. 

He pressed the lever just as her 
fingers touched him. 

The instant sharp slap of the ex- 
plosion was the last sound he heard. 

AT THE instant Ben James 
xjL Pertin pressed the release, ex- 
plosive shears cut the aft end of the 
ship free. The canopy flew out and 
away. The air puffed into 
emptiness. The probe rocket drop- 
ped free and began to align itself 
with the now near great disk of Ob- 
ject Lambda. 

The first thing Pertin felt was the 
sharp pain of the explosion, then 
the second, longer, more deadly 
pain as the air pressure dropped to 
instant zero and his blood and body 
fluids, the air in his lungs, the gases 
dissolved in his blood, tried to 
expand to fill the enormous 



60 



IF 




emptiness all around. He caught a 
glimpse of the silvery girl, arms, 
legs and broken wings flailing, as 
she shot past him, careened off the 
jagged edge of metal where the 
shears had cut the probe satellite 
free and ricocheted out into 
emptiness. If she made a sound he 
could not hear it. There was no 
longer a way for him to hear. There 
was no longer a continuous medium 
of air to carry it. 

He had just a glimpse of the huge 
near surface of Object Lambda-^- 
the body he had called “Cuckoo” — 
as it hung like a great dull circle in 
the empty sky, cutting off one spiral 
limb of his own, eternally lost, 
galaxy. 

He did not see the orienting jets 
of the satellite spurt carefully con- 
trolled measures of flame to 
position it for its final thrust* He 
did not see the great violet flare of 
the fusion rockets that began to 
slow it. He could not see any of 
that, because by then he was dead. 

Neither he nor anyone else in the 
probe ship saw the great series of 
flares as the satellite fought to slow 
itself. Aurora flew on, without 
power, containing only the last 
flickerings of life for a few of its 
beings, back toward the galaxy. 
The probe left it as it drew more 
and more rapidly away. The 
distance between them was millions 
of miles before the satellite made its 
first meteoric contact with the outer 
layers of that anomalously thick at- 
mosphere around Cuckoo. 



Here was a spectacle worth 
watching, if there had been eyes left 
in Aurora to sec. The satellite 
plunged through a carefully plan- 
ned chord of the atmosphere. Its 
ablative surface burned and tore 
away in a flare like all the fireworks 
in man’s history going off at once. 
But there was none to see — not 
Sirian eye nor She/liak sensors, not 
T’Worlie or Earthman or alien of 
any kind. Where life remained at all 
it lacked strength for curiosity and 
it would not remain alive very long. 

Fifty thousand years later Aurora 
might pass near some sun of an 
outstretched spiral arm. But by 
then it would no longer matter to 
anyone, except as a historical 
curiosity from a time about which 
no one any longer cared. 

S OME days later the sensors on 
Sun One reported that the 
probe was in a stable orbit. The 
beings on Sun One responded with 
pleasure — everyone was delighted 
that the project was a success. 

Now stable, the probe began to 
do the work for which it had been 
designed. 

The complex H-bomb sequencing 
units and the small, strong 
pressure-plate shock absorbers fell 
away, responding to remote con- 
trols from Sun One. They would 
never be used again. 

The tachyon receiving unit began 
to emit a stream of tiny metallic 
shards, none larger than a few

inches in its greatest measure. 

When some hundreds of them 
were through, floating like a me- 
tallic mist around the drone, a 
quick small machine came through 
and began to catch them and link 
them together. Time passed — hours 
and then days. A boxlike shape 
took form and became a larger 
tachyon receiver — now ready for 
action. 

From tens of thousands of light- 
years away an angular, crystalline 
machine flashed along the tachyon 
patterns and emerged in the new 
receiver. It was not alive. It was not 
even a robot or a proxy like the 
Purchased People. It was simply an 
automatic machine that sensed 
certain potentials and charges, 
doublechecked the strength of the 
materials and the solidity of the 
joints, directed the hufnmingbird- 
sized construction machine to cor- 
rect a few faults and then reported 
that Cuckoo Station, the orbiting 
body around what had been called 
Object Lambda, was now ready to 
be built. 

A few hours later the first girders 
of what would eventually be a thou- 
sand-meter revolving wheel were 
being joined together. 

Plates appeared to surround the 
girders with an airtight sheath. Ma- 
chines arrived to be stored in them. 
Atmosphere was pumped through 
to fill the chambers. The handling 
machines were busy, taxed beyond 
their capacities — more handling 
machines were sent and soon the 



orbiting station was whole, supplied ; 
and being-rated. 

The first living beings appeared. ; 
A Sheliak, naked to the cold of in- 1 
tergalactic space (but for the brief l 
time of its transition to the orbiting : 
wheel unharmed by it.) A dozen ; 
PWorlies arrived in a single elastic 
air-bubble and scurried into the 
protection of the orbital wheel. 
There were Sirians, reptilian 
Aldebaranians, a hive of Boaty 
Bits, and at the last a couple of 
humans. 

One of them was named Ben Linc’ 
Pertin. 

He floated out of the tachyon 
receiver in his pressure suit, his 
thruster unit at the ready in his 
hands. 

He did not use it at once. He 
paused a moment to look around. 

The first thing he did was to stare 
down at the enormous flat surface 
of Cuckoo, so near, so huge, so in- 
credible as it hung like an endless 
shield in the sky. 

The second was to look back to 
where the galaxy lay, sparkling like 
the sea of stars it was. 

He could not see the doomship, 
but he knew it must be somewhere 
in his line of sight. There were no 
signals from it any more. There was 
no way of detecting it and would 
not be for tens of thousands of 
years. 

He stared for a moment, then 
shrugged. “Poor bastards,” he 
whispered and turned and drove 
toward the wheel awaiting him. •

A 

WOMAN 

AND 

HER 

FRIEND 

MICHAEL G CONEY 




I 

T 'HE accident that threatened to 
determine Woman Alice 
Lander’s life expectancy was due to 
a combination of circumstances. 
Afterward she might blame the 
heat or her own exhaustion, but 
principally she would blame her 
Friend. Her Friend, she had already 
decided, was neurotic and objec- 
tionable and the long car journey 
had been a mistake. But Woman 
Lander considered herself a kind- 
hearted soul and, as she was by 
trade a placement officer, she felt it 
her duty to take on this responsi- 
bility. 

The Friend knew Alice’s occu- 
pation — she had wheedled out this 
information within ten minutes of 
their meeting. A placement officer? 
she had grated in her metallic voice. 
That's interesting, my dear . 

And Alice had known what would 
happen. She had contracted to look 
after the Friend for a period of one 
week. During this week, she 
guessed, the Friend would make 
persistent, unnerving attempts . to 
get placed. She would play on 
Alice’s sympathies. She would ca- 
jole and toward the end of the week 
she would threaten — feebly and 
blusteringly. 

The road was dusty and the sur- 
face uneven — puddle-like mirages 
came and went in the heat of the 
sun. Alice concentrated on her 
driving. She was thirty-nine years 
and six months old and her reac- 



tions were not what they had been. 
She looked forward to reaching the 
main road to Axminster and 
switching over to automatic. Not 
for the first time she regretted the 
public-spirited whim that had takrti 
her to the Westbury Transfer 
Center. 

Beside her the Friend whined, 
“Do you think there’s a chance of 
my being placed at Axminster?” 

Alice forced herself to think 
calmly. The Friend had undergone 
her traumatic experience only 
yesterday, her fortieth birthday, 
when she had been taken to the 
transfer center and divested of her 
body. Her brain, wired up in what 
the medical profession facetiously 
called a “holding pattern" and sur- 
rounded with nutrient fluid, re- 
posed in a black box on the seat of 
the hovercar. 

So the Friend, named Betty 
Benson, was naturally not feeling 
happy, although she was 
considerably luckier than the thou- 
sands of other Friendship Boxes at 
that moment reposing in Westbury 
and Axminster centers — at least 
she had been contracted for. Alice 
tried to make allowances. Alice had 
had six bodies in her lifetime and 
had never been obliged to undergo 
the transitional period of Friend- 
ship due to the fact that placement 
officers were in the preferred trade 
& category. Every time she had 
reached the physical age of forty 
she . had been transferred im- 
mediately into the body of a six- 



66 . 



IF 




month-old child and had resumed 
life with hardly a break, although 
naturally somewhat incapacitated 
at first. Alice had never found the 
enforced idleness of her early child- 
hoods a hardship — she had looked 
on each as a pleasant extended va- 
cation with no responsibilities 
preparatory to recommencing 
working life. She was, in fact, 
looking forward to her next 
transfer.* 

But Betty Benson, whining with 
misery beside her, was one of the 
unlucky ones. It might be several 
years before she was placed and 
transferred into a host. Alice was 
responsible for dealing with the 
Axminster waiting list — a for- 
midable four hundred-odd thou- 
sand names reposed in the filing 

* The Act of 2056 guaranteed virtually 
everyone then alive immortality. It specified 
that on his/her fiftieth birthday every person 
of Earth had to attend a Transfer Center, 
where his/her brain was removed and placed 
into the cranium of a six-month-old child. 
The person then went through another child- 
hood to maturity and the process was 
repeated at his or her fiftieth birthday — ad 
infinitum. So successful was the Act at 
curbing the human birthrate that by 2066 it 
became pecessary to introduce what were 
euphemistically called Friendship boxes 
— metal containers filled with nutrient 
fluid in which a brain was placed pending 
availability of a host body. In order to make 
the wait more pleasant the boxes were equip- 
ped with audio pickups and vocal chords. By 
the year 2128 it was decided to decrease the 
active population (while birthrate had de- 
clined, the number of people had not) by re- 
ducing the age for Compulsory Transfer to 
40. Simultaneously came about the Pre- 
ferred Trade concept, which made it un- 



cabinets of her office. So she 
thought hard before answering the 
Friend’s question — she was not 
allowed to divulge precise in- 
formation. 

“The Axminster list is pretty 
long,” she admitted^Then, in order 
to lessen the blow, she said, “But 
there’s always a chance of your get- 
ting a makeover.” A small chance. 
Makeovers seldom happened. 

“A makeover?” queried Friend 
Betty Benson eagerly. 

“You know— you get friendly 
with someone in a preferred trade 
and when the time comes for her to 
take her transfer she might not 
want it. She may have had an un- 
happy last life or may just be tired 
and won’t want to go through it all 
again. And sometimes you can find 

necessary for “essential personnel,” such as 
government officials and civil servants, to 
spend any time in a Friendship box — at age 
40 they were transferred into a host body. 

By 2159 old heads were firmly in the sad- 
dle and the world was solidly in the grip of 
the System. Almost no one remembered 
what a young person was. Androids were 
developed to serve as host bodies. Hand- 
some, healthy and intelligent, grown from 
the best genetic material available, they were 
nevertheless discriminated against because 
of certain skin discolorations and most 
people continued to prefer waiting periods in 
Friendship boxes. 

The human birthrate, however, continued 
to drop — and Friends in boxes wielded 
votes. The Total Death Act— which 
prescribed termination of all persons con- 
victed of any offense from overtime parking 
up — was passed in 2176 to shorten Friend- 
ship box waiting period for others. 

The events in this story took place in the 
year 2256. 



A WOMAN AND HER FRIEND

a Friend due to be placed, who 
decides she likes it better in the box 
and doesn’t want a body. It some- 
times happens, believe it or not. If 
so — if someone really doesn’t want 
her transfer — she can assign it to 
whomever she likes; You, for 
instance.” She didn’t add that in 
order to achieve this the Friend had 
to make himself pretty damned 
pleasant. 

“Oh, my God. What chance 
would I stand of that?” The box, 
bouncing slightly on the seat, 
seemed almost to shrivel with de- 
spair. 

“Do I take it this is your first 
time as a Friend?” asked Alice. 

The box hesitated. “Yes,” she 
admitted at last. 

It figured. Woman Betty Benson 
had been preferred in the past and 
had lost her status through some 
minor misdemeanor not sufficiently 
serious to be punishable by total 
death. She had come down in the 
world. She was bitter and preju- 
diced. 

And Alice had contracted to look 
after her for a week. The prospect 
was not inviting. She felt a fury 
knot her stomacn. She should have 
checked the records -at the Center 
before being carried away by sym- 
pathy for the stack of black boxes 
she had seen muttering to each 
other,, bickering and bemoaning 
their inactivity. 

“Look here,” she said, threading 
the car carefully through a village. 
“You and I have got to get along 



together for a week. Just a week, 
that’s all — and I promise that at the 
end of that time I’ll try to find 
another woman to take you over. I 
won’t send you back to the center 
unless there’s no alternative.” 

“Thanks.” There was a hint of 
sarcasm in the reply. “Ah, might 1 
ask how old you are, my dear?” 
The harsh voice had changed again. 
Its tone had become unctuous. It 
was astonishing, thought Alice, 
how the speaker transmitted each 
change in inflection. 

“I’m thirty-nine,” she replied 
firmly, “and I have no intention of 
granting you a makeover. I’m not 
tired opictive life.” 

“My dear, I wouldn’t dream — 
Look, I’m sorry. You must realize 
that all this is new to me. It’s 
having no eyes that hurts the most. 
For the next week, will you be my 
eyes, Alice? Tell me what you see. 
Let me know what’s happening.” 

A sound psychological approach, 
thought Alice. The Friend would 
make Alice indispensable. And at 
the end of the week the Friend, in 
electronic tears, would beg Alice to 
keep her on — she couldn’t do 
without her. And so on, week after 
week, chasing the faint chance that 
Alice might, in six month’s time, 
grant her a makeover and opt for 
the Friendship Box . 

Not a chance in the world. 

Playing along, she said, “We’re 
doing fifty-three miles an hour and 
reaching the main road, thank God. 
We’re passing through a village-

IF 




Kinverton. There’s a Tilling station. 
I’m pulling in.” 

‘‘What brand of fuel does it sell?” 
asked the Friend eagerly. 

“Orinoco,” lied Alice for a small, 
nasty satisfaction. She wound down 
the window and addressed the ap- 
proaching child: “Six gallons, 

please.” 

The youngster, a brown-eyed and 
handsome lad of about five years, 
wrestled with the heavy hose. He 
swore comprehensively as he tried 
to twist the hose toward the 
hovercar’s fuel tank, only to have it 
writhe out of the chubby, scarred 
hands that betrayed him as an 
android. “I’m sorry,” he 
apologized hastily. He tried again 
and this time successfully jammed 
the nozzle home. “Give me another 
year’s growth and I’ll sort this bas- 
tard out,” he promised. 

Alice Lander looked at him 
reprovingly. “You’re too small to 
work,” she said. “You’ll overtax 
yourself. You’ll regret it later on.” 

He stared at her furiously — then 
his expression changed. “Hey,” he 
exclaimed. “Aren’t you Woman 
Lander? Of the Axminster 
placement office?” 

“That’s right,” skid Alice, sur- 
prised. She looked at him closely, 
but didn’t recognize him. She had 
to admit that androids tended to 
look alike unless you knew them 
personally. 

He was smiling pleasantly now. 
“Surely you remember me? Christ, 
no — of course you wouldn’t. I was 



in my previous body.” He made a 
gesture of snapping his Angers, but 
the soft young flesh remained 
silent. “But I remember you— God, 
yes. You placed me five years agb.” 
Five years ago? Alice thought 
hard, feeling slightly embarrassed. 
She took a shot in the dark. “Joel 
Wittig?” she tried hopefully. 
“Surely it can’t be Joel Wittig?” 

The child grinned, delighted. 
“The same,” he said. “You re- 
membered. Five years ago you 
placed me within the day — and me 
a garage hand. I’ll always be 
grateful for that. I only hope I’m as 
lucky the next time — ” His voice 
trailed off as he caught sight of the 
box on the seat beside Alice. “It’s a 
long time yet,” he said eventually. 
“See you again. Look after your- 
self, Woman Lander.” 

Alice drove off in a glow of self- 
esteem that was immediately 
dispelled by the Friend. 

“How come you placed him right 
away?” she asked with an abrupt 
return to her waspish manner. 
“How did he get to jump the 
queue?” 

Alice sighed. “He’s an android.” 
The Friend wouldn’t have known, 
not being able to see. The box was a 
great leveler. 

“So what? Are they better than 
us or something?” 

“No, of course not,” Alice re- 
plied, her steering unsteady as she 
veered, fast, on to the- main 
Axminster road. “But their birth 
rate is rising while ours is falling. 



A WOMAN AND HER FRIEND

An android can usually transfer im- 
mediately on his fortieth birthday. 
Humans have to wait. It's as simple 
as that. Android babies are 
available to humans, you know.” 

“I’d rather wait a thousand years 
than have an android body,” ex- 
claimed the Friend. “The very idea 
is disgusting!” 

“It’s a better body than you may 
ever get otherwise,” retorted Alice 
sharply. She felt strongly on the 
subject as a result of a certain 
blissful vacation many years ago. 
“Androids tend to be stronger than 
we are arid they have shown greater 
capacity for learning.” 

“Nonsense,” said the Friend 
forcefully. “That’s just propa- 
ganda — put out so they won’t feel 
inferior with those awful fingers 
and those strawberry marks all over 
them.” 

“A lot of them are unmarked.” 
Alice decided it was time to change 
the subjects” We’ re passing through 
a village now,” she remarked. 
Children played at the roadside — or 
were they children? These days you 
couldn’t tell. She remembered her 
own childhood, her original child- 
hood, and experienced a sense of 
loss. Then she told herself the 
reaction was ridiculous. There is 
one period of innocence in a 
person’s life and one only. Compul- 
sory transfer hadn’t altered that. It 
had just made one’s age of in- 
nocence seem such a long time ago. 

In a sentimental daze she scanned 
the small figures on the pavement. 



That was the reason she was too 
late in her instinctive stabbing at 
the brake when a child — a real 
child — dashed into the road almost 
under the skirts of the hovercar. 

Normally this would not have 
mattered — the automatic control 
would have been activated by the 
child’s crossing the safety beam. 
But in her enormous irritation at 
the Friend, Alice had forgotten to 
engage the automatic brake while 
swinging to the main road. 

Veering wildly from side to side 
the car raced on while Alice strug- 
gled to regain control. A small 
body flew at a tangent toward the 
houses, to lie still with its neck bent 
back at a terrifying angle. 



I T WAS, of course, an android 
child whom Alice Lander 
struck. She knew this instantly — a 
human child would have been 
mentally adult and would not have 
scuttled across the road in front of a 
speeding hovercar. But what caused 
her to whimper softly to herself as 
she switched hastily to automatic 
and accelerated rapidly was the fact 
that she was thirty-nine years and 
six months old and had committed 
a criminal offence in driving on a 
main road without engaging the au- 
tomatic — and as a result had in- 
jured a child. 

The fact that the child was an 
android made no difference — 
Woman Lander had not one atom 
of prejudice in her makeup. She 



70 



IF 




had outlived that sort of thing many 
lives ago. And a little over a 
hundred years ago she had gained a 
deep insight into the android per- 
sonality as a result of a passionate 
love affair. 

So the reason she didn't stop was 
not the breed of her victim, but 
simply her own age. 

Thirty-nine years and six months. 
The countdown period, they called 
it — the period when a person be- 
came ultra-cautious. A crime com- 
mitted just before transfer meant, 
quite simply, the death sentence. 
Alice Lander suddenly had less 
than a year to live. The statutory 
refusal of future transfer, known 
ominously as total death, would be 
mandatory in her case. 

Her knuckles were white around 
the useless wheel and tears eased 
their hesitant way down her cheeks. 

“What was that noise?’’ asked 
the Friend. “I heard a thud just 
then.’’ 

Alice didn’t reply. Silently she 
struggled to adjust her emotions. 
She was Woman Alice Lander, an 
impeccable citizen, due for transfer 
in six month’s time — unless she 
opted for a premature, which was 
sometimes done in preferred trades 
when the body was failing. 

“I heard it clearly,’’ grated the 
Friend. “You didn’t hit anyone, did 
you?’’ 

Alice wondered if someone had 
gotten her number. The eyes of 
children are sharp. 

“Wouldn’t do to have an accident 



at your age,’’- the box remarked. 
“Don’t you think you ought to 
stop?’’ 

“Why?’’ asked Alice, at last 
under control. 

“Well, I mean, someone might be 
hurt. You had the car on auto- 
matic, of course?” 

“Of course. It was probably a 
bird, the road sensors only pick up 
at ground level.” 

“Damned big bird. I didn’t know 
the albatross was a visitor to these 
parts. Why are you driving so 
fast?” 

“I don’t want to be late.” 

“Late? What for? I thought we 
were just going to your place.” 

“I thought we might — take in a 
show or something.” 

“You what?” The Friend’s voice 
became suddenly smooth — Alice 
imagined it was menacing. “Look, 
are you in some kind of trouble? I 
may be blind, but I can hear. Just 
then, after that bump, I could have 
sworn I heard you whimper.” 
“Whimper?” Alice’s voice uncon- 
trollably rose a semitone. 

“You whimpered--like a carrier 
dog. It could be a nervous habit. I 
knew a man once who had one — 
they tend to get hold of you and you 
can’t get rid of them when you’ve 
been subject to them for over a 
hundred years. This man, whenever 
he laughed, used to snort right at 
the end of the laugh.” Here the 
Friend obliged with an imitation. 
“Ha, ha, snort. Like a pig. He used 
to apologize afterward.” 



A WOMAN AND HER FRIEND 



71 




“I’m sorry,” said Alice 
desperately. 

“It’s quite all right,” the Friend 
assured her. “I didn’t mind, but it 
had me worried for a moment. I 
wouldn’t like to think you’d hit 
anybody. Not with a clean sheet 
and only six months to go. It would 
be tragic, as if we haven’t got 
enough problems already, what 
with me and your long waiting 
list—” 

At that moment it occurred to 
Alice that she was going to be 
blackmailed. 



II 

I T WAS by now early afternoon 
and the black main road was sil- 
very. with heat. Alice was hungry, 
thirsty and in need of a washroom. 
She couldn’t stop, however, be- 
cause sooner or later the police, no 
doubt notified already, would be 
hard on her heels looking for a red 
hovercar, 2254 International Mo- 
tors* license number B-67302P. 
Traffic violations had become so 
rare during her several lives that she 
was no longer sure whether au- 
thorities still used road blocks and 
she held her breath at each blind 
curve, expecting to find her way 
barricaded. 

Her mouth was dry and foul- 
tasting. Another spasm clutched 
her lower abdomen and she tensed 
in the seat, glancing at the Friend 
by her side and for a moment al- 



most envying the box its freedom 
from urgent natural functions. A 
signpost flashed by at an 

intersection — twenty miles to 

Axminster. Increasing speed, she 
wondered if she could hold out that 
long. 

“I expect you could do with a cup 
of coffee,” remarked the Friend. 
“Don’t hurry on my account. Pull 
in and relax, why don’t you? 
Traveling at this time of day and in 
the sun is tiring. Makes the eyes 
ache, I used to find — then your 
vision starts playing tricks. Thank 
God for the automatic control, I 
used to say.” 

Fillings stations whipped by, the 
pumps like sentinels at the roadside 
observing Alice’s headlong prog- 
ress. Above the high whine of the 
turbine she kept imagining she 
could hear the shriller, banshee wail 
of police pursuit. 

Axminster seven miles. 

“What was that?” queried the 
Friend suddenly, so that Alice, lost 
in misery, jumped. “I thought I 
heard something like a siren.” 

“Nonsense,” said Alice sharply, 
listening. “It’s the engine. The oil 
level may be a bit low. It often 
makes a noise like that — there’s a 
leak somewhere.” 

“Maybe you ought to slow down 
a bit.” 

“We’ll be all right. We’re nearly 
there now.” 

Axminster two miles. The 
concrete suburbs flashed by. The 
sound of the car’s progress re- 



72 



IF 




bounded as a rhythmic pulsing 
from the lampposts. Alice throttled 
back, carefully observing the speed 
limit. She turned left at an 
intersection, right into a parkjng 
space, killed the engine and stepped 
out into the sudden heat of the city. 
She hurried around the car, seized 
the Friend and slammed the door. 
She glanced around frantically, got 
her bearings and plunged into a 
nearby john. 

Emerging gratefully, the Friend^ 
in her hand, she paused, stared, 
changed direction and walked with 
studied casualness into a super- 
market. 

Behind her several uniformed 
men were examining the hovercar 
with professional interest. 

“Are we on our way to your 
place?” asked the Friend loudly and 
shoppers turned their heads. 

‘Tm just going to pick up a few 
things.” 

“Don’t bother on my account,” 
said the Friend. “I don’t eat, you 
Jcnow.” 

Alice piled a random selection of 
groceries into a cart and wheeled it 
to the cash desk. Behind her rose a 
scream of protest as a shoplifter 
was apprehended. Alice placed her 
provisions on a turntable and the 
cashier rapidly totaled them up. He 
was tall and fair-haired. He smiled 
at Alice pleasantly. 

“Cash or charge?” 

“Charge,” she said without 
thinking, handing over her code 
card. 



“Name?” The name was on the 
card, but the question was required 
by law. 

There was a commotion beside 
them as the shoplifter, a woman in 
"her late thirties, was dragged away 
,by a uniformed store attendant. 
Her arms were pinned behind her 
back and the attendant was holding 
up Exhibit A, a small packet of 
soap powder. A jumble of desperate 
words tumbled from the woman’s 
trembling lips. “For God’s sake — I 
was only looking at it — I just 
picked it up to see if it had a lucky 
number, that’s all, I swear. You 
can’t do this to me — I’m thirty-nine 
years old — I’m thirty-nine years 
old!” 

“The name’s Woman Alice 
Lander.” 

Alice spun around. For a dream- 
like moment she thought the name 
referred to the doomed woman. 
Then she realized that the Friend 
had replied to the cashier’s 
question. 

Trying to control herself, she 
smiled at him nervously as he ran 
his forefinger down a list. Surely , 
she thought, they can’t have caught 
up with me yet . It would take a 
while to trace her as the car’s 
owner, assuming that they had al- 
ready identified the vehicle with the 
accident. The police might merely 
have been carrying out one of their 
periodic roadworthiness spot : 
checks, she thought hopefully. 

She glanced through the super- 
market window. The car was gone. 



A WOMAN AND HER FRIEND

The police had towed it away for 
further examination. 

The cashier smiled again, setting 
down the list. “Right,” he said. He 
inserted the card into a slot, then 
returned it. “Shall we deliver for 
you?” 

“Thank you.” She smiled back, 
weak with relief. 

“I thought you wanted the stuff 
now,” said the Friend. 

“Deliver it, please,” she said 
firmly as the cashier raised his eye- 
brows. He nodded and she moved 
away, contriving to strike the box 
heavily against the counter. The 
Friend squealed protest. 

She left through the rear doors of 
the supermarket, stepping into the 
abrupt sunshine and the quiet of a 
tree-shaded public park. Neat paths 
led past long bench seats on which 
people relaxed, faces turned to the 
gun. Some fed birds. The scene was 
one of tranquillity and Alice stood 
still for a moment, taking it in, ap- 
preciating it deeply. She sat on a 
nearby bench. 

“Are we there?” asked the 
Friend. 

In the peaceful atmosphere of the 
park Alice began to collect her 
thoughts and get the recent run- 
away events into perspective. 
What, exactly, was her position? 
She had injured a child in a road ac- 
cident and the police, by now, 
would have identified her car as 
being the one responsible. Before 
long thiy would have traced the car 
to her and her name would appear 



on the indicator boards as a wanted 
person. For just a moment she 
considered leaving the town and 
going into hiding in one of the re- 
moter regions. Around the fringes 
of Dartmoor were abandoned cot- 
tages which, due to the difficulty of 
farming the rugged terrain, had 
never been ploughed under. It 
frequently happened that a criminal 
in his late thirties would disappear 
in that direction — after all, he had 
nothing to lose. For a while she 
entertained the almost romantic 
notion of the simple existence— a 
small cottage, a diet of roots and 
berries — maybe she could catch 
and tame a wild goat . 

Then common sense took over. 
She would never get out of town. 
The Friend would make sure of 
that. If she abandoned the box, it 
would raise the alarm within 
minutes. If she took it, it would 
soon suspect that the journey was 
becoming long and would again 
raise the alarm. 

She had, however, one chance. 

“Are we there?” asked the Friend 
again. “Is this your place? I can 
hear birds. The sound’s not right. 
There are no echoes. Where are 
we?” 

In a moment’s sudden fury at the 
persistence of the Friend she con- 
templated dropping it over the 
bridge into the river or otherwise 
disposing of it permanently. But 
this again was impractical. She 
would be seen — the box would be 
rescued immediately.

IF 




Her only answer was a premature 
transfer. 

If she could reach a transfer 
center and persuade the doctors 
that she had good reason for her 
request, backed up by her authority 
as a placement officer. She might, 
with luck, obtain a quick transfer 
before her name appeared on the 
indicator boards. Then she would 
be in possession of a new young 
body and nobody could take that 
from her for another forty years. 
She might get a ten-year sentence 
for dangerous driving, but at least 
after that she would have thirty 
years of freedom before the statu- 
tory total death. 

“Where are we?” the Friend 
rasped again. “Are you there?” 

“I’m here. I’m just resting for 
a moment. I’m tired after the 
drive. We’re in the park at Axmin- 
ster — it’s very nice. There are a lot 
of late-thirties about — dreaming 
about their next childhood, I ex- 
pect. None of them can have more 
than a year to go by the look of 
them.” This was a phenomenom of 
the countdown period. Many 
persons shortly due for a transfer 
seemed to retire from active life 
altogether rather than run the risk 
of committing some crime. “There 
are birds in the park and one or two 
android children playing.” 

“Thanks for the information. It’s 
good to hear from you again,” ob- 
served the box sarcastically. “Fine 
sort of companion you’re turning 
out to be.” 



There was menace in the voice 
again and Alice caught her breath. 
The Friend was turning nasty. “I’m 
sorry,” she said gently. 

“Sorry about a lot of things, I 
don’t doubt,” observed the box. 
“There’s something weird about 
this whole business. Are we going 
back to the car?” 

“No. We can walk. It isn’t far 
from here.” 

Across the park an indicator 
board was flashing — she could see a 
string of names but at this distance 
could not read them. She picked up 
the box and strolled across 
casually. It appeared that 
Johnathan Stone was wanted for 
assault. There were several others. 
The name of Alice Lander did not 
appear. 

^OTyet. 

i 1 She wondered when the 
Friend would make her move. 
There was no doubt that she was 
suspicious and the voice issuing 
from the box held unpleasant, 
gloating undertones. But the Friend 
might imagine that, for the time 
being, she had everything under 
control. She might reason along the 
same lines as Alice herself, deciding 
that there was no way Alice could 
get rid of her. So she would bide her 
time and then, perhaps later 
tonight, would come further sug- 
gestions about the waiting list and 
Alice’s responsibility for deciding 
the local priorities of placing for 
transfer. 



A WOMAN AND HER FRIEND 



75 




Or would the climax come when 
the Friend discovered — or rea- 
soned — that Alice was no longer 
able to use the car? This would con- 
firm her suspicions and she would 
have to push matters forward, get- 
ting her name at the top of the list 
before Alice was arrested. Yes, the 
Friend would have to move quickly 
if she were to take advantage of the 
situation. 

The box suddenly said “I don’t 
want to walk. You’re jogging me 
about too much. I want to take the 

_ _ _ 11 

car. 

“There’s a bus station just here,” 
said Alice quickly. 

“Take the car.” 

“Look,” said Alice. “I don’t 
want to use the car. I’ve had a long 
drive and I’d rather relax on the 
bus. It’s only a short run. Why 
should I take the car?” 

“Prove to me the car’s 
available,” snapped the Box. 

Alice felt herself flush with 
temper. “Why should I?” 

“Because I think the car’s been 
confiscated by now and you’re on 
the run. I’m nobody’s fool. You’re 
going to make for the outlying dis- 
tricts and lie low.” The Friend’s 
voice was dangerous, triumphant — 
she had decided she held a winning 
hand. “Look here, I’ll give you a 
chance. I could give you away now. 
I could start yelling and turn you in. 
But I won’t. Just take me along to 
your office and put me near the top 
of the list — not the very top. That 
would look odd. Just slip me in 



somewhere about number ten — it 
won’t take a minute and then we’ll 
catch the outward bus. You can get 
off at the terminus, leave me under 
the seat and make for the hills, as I 
believe the expression is. I’ll keep 
quiet until I’m back in town, which 
will give you a good start. Fair 
enough?” 

So this was it. The confrontation 
had come a little sooner than Alice 
had expected. She felt weak sud- 
denly and sat down. Names of 
criminals slid down the indicator 
board and disappeared off the bot- 
tom like drowning men, only to be 
drearily resurrected at the top 
before recommencing their down- 
ward plunge. Jennifer Spragg, 
shoplifting. Alice wondered if that 
was the woman she had seen in the 
supermarket — maybe she had 
made a break for it. The name 
would be repeated throughout the 
region in public places, in the 
placement offices, the transfer 
centers, just about everywhere. 
Nancy Blackett, kidnaping. Incon- 
sequentially she thought that these 
names sounded like those of crimi- 
nals — it would look odd to see the 
name of Alice Lander there for 
dangerous driving. But it was not 
there yet. 

Her mind made up, she stood, the 
box in her hand. 

“We’ll go to the placement of- 
fice,” she said. “To my room. It’s 
just a short bus ride from here.” 

The Friend chuckled trium- 
phantly. “Thank you, my dear.”

IF 




T HE fare mechanism winked at 
her, knowingly it seemed, as 
she stepped on the platform. Dis- 
concerted, she made the same 
stupid mistake as before, auto- 
matically thrusting her card into 
the slot. The machine chuntered 
over this, riffling in microseconds 
through its relayed list of unde- 
sirables, then spat the card back at 
her. At least it was more efficient 
than the supermarket, she thought. 
The checking off didn’t have to be 
done manually. But her route 
through Axminster was being 
recorded — she should have paid 
cash. She stepped off the platform 
and made for a seat. 

“Hold it,” the mechanism 
barked. 

She wheeled, her heart thumping. 
A last-minute name had been re- 
layed on to the criminal record. The 
doors were shut— she was trapped. 
The eye of the machine, was 
winking rapidly — another, yellower 
eye near the deck blinked in sym- 
pathy. The machine was about to 
denounce her. 

“What is it?” she mumbled 
through trembling lips. 

The machine coughed, clearing 
itself of static. “You have, excess 
baggage,” It got out eventually. 

Shaking with relief, Alice 
apologized. “I’m so sorry. I have a 
Friend with me. I quite forgot.” 
Again she had to insert her code 
card — again live through the 
instant of terror before it was back 
in her hand. She stumbled away. 

A WOMAN AND HER FRIEND 



“It’s full fare for a Friend,” the 
machine barked after her. “Don't 
forget that again, Woman.” 

“I won’t,” she promised and sat 
down heavily, placing the box on 
the seat beside her. 

A man sitting behind her leaned 
forward and touched her shoulder 
sympathetically — she saw the scars 
of the android. “Don’t let it bother 
you,” he said. “I’ve been caught 
~ like that myself. It’s disgraceful. 
When people are good enough to 
take Friends the least , the au- 
thorities should do is let them travel 
free.” He tapped the box gently. 
“Hello, there,” he said. 

“Hello,” replied the Friend 
guardedly. Alice could guess her 
feelings. The last thing they wanted 
was to be drawn into conversation. 
In their present nervous state it 
would be only too easy to arouse 
suspicion. Alice turned around, de- 
termined to freeze the conversation 
with a few icy words — then hesi- 
tated as she met the eyes of the man 
behind. They were brown and 
kindly. His expression was tenta- 
tively friendly and there was some- 
thing indefinably familiar about 
him. 

“You’ve taken Friends your- 
self?” she found herself asking. 

“Yes. I think it’s the least we can 
do. We’re the lucky ones, after all, 
right now — and there’s always the 
chance we may become a Friend 
ourselves one day. You never know 
how the birthrate will go.” Ob- 
viously he was preferred and cor- 

77 




rectly deduced that she was, too. 

“That’s good way of looking at 
it.” 

She warmed to him. Beside her 
the box coughed warningly. 
Without quite knowing how it had 
happened, she found she had placed 
the box on the floor and moved 
over — the man was sitting beside 
her. His last transfer had been 
fortunate. He was tall and excep- 
tionally good-looking, his face un- 
blemished by the marks of the Vat. 
He was also approximately the 
same physical age as herself and she 
experienced regret. It was a pity she 
couldn’t turn this chance encounter 
to advantage, but in her present 
position she had no time to form a 
liaison. 

“I’ve got a Friend at the office 
right now,” he said. “A sad case. 
He’s been on the list for eight years 
and it’s getting him down.” He had 
lowered his voice and was talking 
quietly into her ear out of deference 
to the feelings of the box beneath 
the seat. “What are the chances for 
yours?” he asked, nodding in that 
direction. 

“Not good,” admitted Alice. 
“And she’s not happy about it, 
either. If she goes on my list, it’ll be 
ten years before she gets a 
transfer.” 

“Your list?” The android 
regarded her with interest. “You’re 
a placement officer?” 

“Yes. The job can be 
disheartening at times. I can’t help 
telling myself that the only ad- 



vantage of my trade is that it’s 
preferred and then I start hating 
myself, because that’s a selfish 
outlook.” 

“We’re all human. Permit me to 
introduce myself,” he said, taking 
her hand. “I’ve only been in 
Axminster a few days. My name’s 
Phillip Ewell.” 

Phillip Ewell? Alice stared at him 
incredulously. “I’m Alice Lander,” 
she said and watched his expression 
change. 



Ill 

T 'HREE physical lives ago she 
and Phillip Ewell had walked 
hand in hand along the silver sands 
of Exmouth, together in the recur- 
ring joy of emergence into 
adulthood. Since then she had 
known two more physical teenages 
but they had never approached the 
delight of those few weeks over a 
hundred ^years ago when she and 
Phillip had vacationed together at 
the Southern Recreation Center, 
swimming, sailing, making love or 
just lying on the beach, warm in the 
sun and in the wonder of each 
other’s presence. 

Five weeks of heaven before they 
were posted separately to their 
trades — she to become placement 
officer at Axminster, he to attend a 
medical school at the other end of 
the country. People said that in the 
thirties the mind would always have 
made its impression on the physical

face, but looking at him now she 
saw him again as the seventeen- 
year-old of their previous life. The 
eyes watching her with surprise and 
delight were the eyes that had 
regarded her with love all those 
years ago. In the manner of most 
such liaisons they had lost touch 
with each other by the time of her 
next transfer, but she had often 
wondered what had become of him 
and what he looked like now and 
what it would be like if they ever 
met again. And now here he was, 
miraculously beside her in the bus, 
and they were both thirty-nine 
years old — but for her the meeting 
was too late. 

“Alice,” he said softly. “My 
God — Alice, after ail these years. 
I’ve often thought about you.” 

“That goes for me too, Phillip,” 
she said sincerely. “I’ve never 
forgotten that vacation. I’ve been to 
Exmouth since, you know— but it’s 
never been the same.” 

“It was over a hundred years 
ago,” he said slowly. “I wonder 
how much else I can remember 
from that time. Not much, I sup- 
pose. The mind may age more 
slowly than the body, but it ages 
nevertheless and memories disap- 
pear. Only the worthwhile ones stay 
with you always.” 

Still, saying that, he thought of 
their child — she had not wanted it. 

Alice was still gripping his hand 
and her mind was far back in time, 
but a sudden harsh voice jerked her 
back to the realities of the present. 



“What are you two talking 
about?” demanded the FriencL 
querulously. “I can’t hear you. 
Have you put me under the seat? 
All I can hear is a damned turbine. 
You haven’t left me, have you? Are 
you there? Are you there?” The 
voice rose to a shout. 

Phillip smiled at Alice resignedly. 
“You’d better get her out of there 
before she calls the police,” he said. 

Alice started nervously at the 
mention of the law and hastily 
dragged the Friend, none too 
gently, from her resting place. 
Phillip took the box and laid it on 
his knees. 

“Hello, Friend,” he said. “How 
are you doing?” 

“Who the devil are you?” 

He raised his eyebrows at Alice. 
“I’m an old acquaintance of your 
companion,” he replied. “We’ve 
been talking over old times.” 
“Damned inconsiderate of you, 
shoving me out of the way. Old 
times? What have you two been 
cooking up?” 

“Cooking up?” 

“Never mind,” muttered the 
Friend. “Are you there, Alice?” 
“Yes.” 

“Haven’t we arrived yet? How 
much farther do we go?” 

Alice sighed, glancing apolo- 
getically at Phillip. “We get off at 
the next stop,” she reassured the 
box. 

“So do I,” remarked Phillip. 
“Look, why don’t we stop in 
somewhere and have a drink?” 



79 



A WOMAN AND HER FRIEND 




“No,” snapped the Friend, 
before Alice could reply. “We’ve 
got a lot to do. We’re short of 
time.” The box chuckled un- 
pleasantly. 

“I’m sorry about that,” said 
Phillip. He addressed himself 
quietly to Alice. “Can you give me 
your number. I’d like to call you 
when you’re- free.” 

“Free?” cackled the box. “Yes, 
give the gentleman your number, 
my dear. By all means.” 

As the bus hissed to a stop Phillip 
quickly jotted down Alice’s address 
and visiphone number and they got 
to their feet. On the pavement he 
handed her the Friend. “I’ll go 
now,” he said. “Look, do you mind 
if I call you tomorrow?” - He 
glanced at the box significantly. 
“We can talk over old times 
together. Would you like that?” 
Alice nodded dumbly and 
watched as Phillip strode away, 
turned, waved and disappeared 
round the corner. She stood for a 
While, her eyes smarting, until a 
grating query from the Friend re- 
minded her that time was running 
out. 



S HE stood in the entrance hall to 
the transfer center and looked 
around Uncertainly. Over to the 
right was the reception desk — 
ahead stretched a long corridor 
lined with doors. The hall was large 
and impersonal like a hospital’s 
outpatient area— along the walls 



stood a few chairs but no people 
were in sight, apart from the girl 
behind the reception desk. She was 
engrossed in a novel. Set high in the 
opposite wall was the inevitable in- 
dicator board. Alice noted that au- 
thorities were still looking for 
Nancy Blackett (kidnaping) among 
various other names. Some of the 
previous names had disappeared. 
Their possessors were presumably 
in custody by now. 

The Friend spoke quietly, alerted 
by the sudden cessation of street 
sounds. “Is this your office?” 

“Yes',” lied Alice as quietly, 
wondering what to do next. If she 
were accosted by anybody the 
ensuing conversation would give the 
game away and the Friend, 
grasping the situation, would 
denounce her. A pile of blankets on 
a nearby trolley gave her an idea. 

“Look herei” she said. “I’ve got 
to get up to my room and there are 
a lot of people about. If they see me 
carrying you they might suspect 
something. I’ll wrap you up for a 
moment. Will that be all right?” 

The Friend considered. “I sup- 
pose so,” she said finally. “But I’ve 
just thought of something. How will 
I kno.w you’ve put my name high on 
the list? I won’t be able to see it. I 
can’t say I exactly trust you. What 
you must do is this. After you’ve 
made my entry in the records you 
must call a colleague into the room 
on some pretext and discuss the 
people at the top of the list, men- 
tioning my name. Otherwise I start 



80 



IF 




screaming. Right? As soon as 
you’ve done that we can leave, 
catch a bus and you make for the 
wilds. I won’t give you away if you 
do as I say. Right?” 

“Right,” echoed Alice resign- 
edly. She took a blanket from the 
trolley and wrapped the Friend 
up thoroughly, making sure the 
microphone and speakers were well 
covered. Then she approached the 
desk. 

“I wish to apply for a premature 
transfer,” she said in a low voice. 
She could not avoid glancing over 
her shoulder. Linton James, rape, 
accompanied the name of Nancy 
Blackett on the indicator board. 

“Name?” asked the receptionist 
brusquely. 

“Woman Alice Lander. Place- 
ment officer. Preferred trade, you 
know.” 

“I know,” the girl said sharply 
and resentfully. She riffled through 
the cards, glanced at the indicator 
board. “Alice Lander,” she 
repeated. “Here we are. Physical 
age thirty-nine. What happened, 
Woman Lander? Your body not 
pretty enough for you?” 

“That’s enough of that.” Alice 
snapped, deciding to take the of- 
fensive. “I’ll have you reported. 
Now give me the application form 
and hold your tongue.” 

Reluctantly the girl handed over 
a form and a pen, glancing 
pointedly at the indicator board 
again as though she expected 
Alice’s name to appear at any 



second. Alice was infuriated and 
prayed inwardly: Don’t let my 
name come up now, not now. Five 
minutes’ time if you like, but not 
now. / can't give her that satis- 
faction. She completed the form 
rapidly and handed it back. 

“Come back in a week.” 

“I’ll see the doctor now, if you 
don’t mind.” 

Sighing, the receptionist lifted a 
phone, spoke a few minutes, then 
replaced the receiver. “Doctor 
Butler will see you,” she informed 
Alice. “Second on the right. You’re 
very lucky. He’s a busy man.” 
Alice’s self-control snapped. 
“Don’t tell me I’m lucky, young 
woman. A word from me would 
have you out from behind that desk 
and into the street, jobless. 
Goodbye — and I hope you enjdy 
your next Friendship — may it be 
long.” 

The girl grinned insolently. 
“That’s twenty-two years from 
now. I’ll have qualified as preferred 
by then, with luck. Enjoy your next 
body. Woman Lander, and may it 
suffer from acne.” 

Then a curious thing happened. 
The girl glanced at the indicator 
board and her jaw dropped. A look 
of surprise crossed her face. Alice 
swung around, her heart lurching, 
but to her relief the names on the 
board were meaningless to her.

The girl was staring at the board 
incredulously and seemed to have 
lost interest in the battle of wits. 
With the Friend bundled under her 
arm Alice stalked away. She tapped 
on the door of the doctor’s office 
and entered. 

The doctor was physically young 
and he looked up with a pleasant 
smile on seeing her. “Woman 
Lander,” he said, rising to his feet 
and taking her hand. “Sit down, sit 
down. I’ve heard about you — 
you’re the local placement officer, 
aren’t you? My patients have 
spoken of you. I’m very pleased to 
meet you. What seems to be the 
trouble?” 

Encouraged, Alice launched into 
a rambling monologue about 
strange pains in the back, 
headaches, und listlessness and a 
general feeling of depression. Lis- 
tening to her dull voice droning on, 
she felt she was doing well. Her 
eyes drifted to the miniature indi- 
cator board on the doctor’s desk 
and her spirits rose slightly. For the 
first time she began to feel some 
certainty that she might be able to 
pull this off. 

The doctor was talking to her 
soothingly. “Well, we can’t have a 
/ woman in your position feeling bad, 
can we? Sickness impairs the effi- 
ciency. I see you’ve only got six 
months to go in any case. Yes — I 
think a premature transfer would 
be the best thing — then a nice va- 
cation for a few years and back to 
the job refreshed. Of course, at such 



short notice you’ll have to take the 
best host available, but I’m sure 
you won’t mind that under the cir- 
cumstances,” He chuckled. “Usu- 
ally I like to find a nice little 
blond girl for my favorite women 
patients in preferred circum- 
stances.” 

“Thank you, Doctor.” She was 
amazed at how easily it was going. 
“It can be done right away? I’ve 
filled in the application.” 

“I should think so. I don’t see 
why not. You’ve informed them at 
your office, I suppose? I can’t 
imagine a woman of your capa- 
bilities not leaving your affairs in 
order.” he laughed. 

“There’s just one thing. Doctor.” 
said Alice tentatively, indicating 
the bundle in her lap. “I have a very 
dear Friend here. She doesn’t know 
my intentions. I couldn’t bear to 
tell her. I told her I was going to an 
electromusic concert— I know she 
can’t stand electromusic but I like 
to take her everywhere. So I wrap- 
ped Jher up.” 

If I can get awayrwith this . I can 
get away with anything , Alice 
thought. 

The doctor was smiling sym- 
pathetically. “It’s nice to know 
there are people like you around. 
Woman Lander. Friends can be an 
encumbrance at times, I know. Are 
you trying to say that you’d like me 
to explain to her — afterward?” 

“I’ll take her with me into the 
operating theater,” said Alice 
hastily. “I’d like to have her with 



82 



IF 




me right up to the end. Then you 
can explain — and perhaps arrange 
for her to be sent back to the 
transfer center at Westbury — that’s 
where I got her from.” 

“That’s quite all right.” Doctor 
Butler stood and Alice followed 
suit, clutching the muffled Friend. 
“I think it’s time we had a word 
with the transfer surgeon. He might 
be able to fit you in right away.” 

“I’ll leave you here,” he said 
later, as he found her a seat in a 
small waiting room. “The surgeon 
will be along in a minute. Good 
luck, Woman Lander.” 

She sat very still, nervously 
twisting her hands together. Now 
that the doctor had gone and her 
time was so close she began to get 
apprehensive again. There was no 
indicator board in the waiting room 
and she began to imagine that 
frightening glissade of names again, 
slowly down the board, disap- 
pearing, reappearing at the top and 
occasionally taking on a new name. 
Was her name on that board yet? 
Had it appeared on the doctor’s 
desk? Was he at this moment 
staring at it, unable to believe that 
Woman Lander was capable of 
crime but seeing it nevertheless? 
The board had to be right, he would 
think, and he would jump to his 
feet, open the door and hurry down 
the corridor to prevent the 
transfer — she could hear footsteps. 

She could hear footsteps coming 
down the hall. 

The door opened. A tall, familiar 



figure entered, stood regarding her 
gravely. 

“Phillip — ” she gasped. 

“W/HATS all this about, 
▼V Alice?” he asked. “Doctor 
Butler told me he thought you had 
reasonable grounds for a premature 
transfer. Is this right? You want 
one now?” He looked puzzled and a 
little hurt. 

“I do,” she said, feeling bewil- 
dered. “Are you the surgeon? I 
didn’t know you worked here.” 
“There seems to be a lot we don’t 
know about each other, Alice,” he 
replied. “Damn it, we’ve only just 
met for the first time in a hundred 
years and I thought — I thought 
you were, well, pleased to see me. I 
thought we might" see each other 
some more — ” He broke off. 

“I would have liked that, too,” 
Alice admitted. She forced down 
surging emotions. “But I’m afraid 
it just can’t be. Don’t ask me to 
explain. I’ve decided I want a 
transfer now — I need it— and 
that’s all there can be to it. Will you 
be performing the operation?” 

“I will, I suppose. Yes, of course 
I will. I couldn’t let anyone else do 
it. I’d just like to know why.” H$ 
hesitated. “It has nothing to do 
with our meeting again, has it?” 
Alice tried to laugh. The sound 
emerged as a sad croak. 

“Of course not, Phillip. It’s just 
that I haven’t been well lately 
and — Well, there’s no point in 
taking chances, is there? You’d be 



A WOMAN AND HER FRIEND

surprised at the figures for brain 
wastage due to unexpected death in 
the late thirties. Why wait when a 
premature is available?” 

He was staring at her. “You look 
fit enough to me, Alice. You don’t 
make sense. There’s something 
else, something you won’t tell me 
about. What is it, Alice? What has 
gone wrong?” 

“Nothing.” She forced a hard 
edge into her voice. “I’ve got 
clearance, Phillip, and I want my 
transfer. Now.” 

Nevertheless he argued and Alice 
grew increasingly frustrated and 
apprehensive. She had no time to 
lose. Her name might be on the in- 
dicator board at this moment. Soon 
the man before her ceased to be 
Phillip, the man she had once loved 
and probably still did— he became a 
menace, a threat to her life. He 
stood there pleading, with each 
word pushing her nearer to total 
death. She panicked. 

“For God’s sake shut up and give 
me my transfer or I’ll make damned 
sure you’re downgraded — ” she 
screamed. 

He stopped talking as abruptly as 
if she had slapped his face. He 
stared at her, shrugged and turned 
to the door. “Come along,” he mut- 
tered. 

Once in the operating theater she 
lay on the table while Phillip scrub- 
bed up and a nurse prepared the 
instruments. The Friend, still 
swathed in blankets, lay on a chair 
near the door. Muffled sounds 



came from her. She had begun to 
get restless — the long delay must 
have made her suspect a trick. 
Phillip glanced at the box and back 
to Alice, looking perplexed. 

Poor man, she thought sadly, he 
doesn’t know what the hell is going 
on and his pride won’t allow him 
further conversation . 

The indicator board was on the 
far wall, before her as she lay. 
Linton James was still at large. She 
wished him luck. People had been 
known to avoid captivity for ten 
years or more once they had 
survived the first few perilous days. 
Such names were deleted from the 
boards after a few days, partly 
through lack of space andpartly be- 
cause it was felt to be bad for the 
morale of the population if the 
same name appeared, minute after 
minute, for months. That was tan- 
gible evidence that crime could, on 
occasion, go unpunished. But in the 
permanent records the name of the 
escaped criminal was not deleted. 

Phillip was shaving her scalp, his 
lips pursed in concentration. The 
nurse had wheeled in the trolley of 
instruments — the scene was one 
Alice had known several times 
before. Except for the sickening 
significance of those names drifting 
down the board.

her ears — his hands were steady. 
She couldn’t see him now — he was 
behind her — but every so often she 
caught sight of the top of his head 
as he bent over her. 

She said impulsively, “I’m sorry 
I shouted at you Phillip. I’ll meet 
you in a year’s time, if I may — ’’ 
and he smiled into her eyes from 
overhead, upside down. For a 
moment she felt better. There was a 
crack in the ceiling, jagged like a 
lightning flash.

James would be running. He 
would have succeeded in catching a 
bus to some country terminus 
before his details were transmitted 
to the ticket mechanism and he had 
walked away, slowly at first and 
casually — then, once he was past 
the houses, he left the road and 
struck across the fields, bending 
low beside the hedges and running. 
His shoes would be caked with mud 
and they would feel heavy on his 
feet. His breath would come fast 
and harsh and he would be wishing 
he hadn’t smoked so much. Alice 
could visualize it all. She almost 
knew what he looked like.

Kidnaping was a serious crime 
and Alice was not sorry they had 
caught Nancy Blackett, whoever 
she was. Alice’s gaze strayed to the 
array of instruments on the trolley 
and she felt the familiar constric- 
tion in her chest as she saw the large 
electrical trepan, a toothed helmet. 
No matter how many transfers a 
person under went he or she never 
quite lost the moment of fear when 
the helmet was positioned. Then, of 
course, the patient was given a shot.

They had gotten James. She 
could see it all. The spottercopter 
had descended out of the sky and 
hovered above him as he twisted 
and ran; his clothes ragged, filthy 
and flapping in the downdraft. He 
had darted across a field, crawled 
along a culvert in an effort to shake 
off the copter tied to him like a kite. 
Other men had converged upon him 
on foot from all directions until, 
screaming, he had thrown himself 
to the ground, had buried his face in 
the stinking mud and waited until 
voices spoke and a rough boot 
rolled him over.

to dilute the predicament of Les 
Anstead, thief — because the board 
seemed in some odd way to be 
waiting, marking time with one 
rhythrtiic name before. They had 
wheeled in another trolley. Phillip 
was speaking to the nurse in low 
tones while she got the helmet 
ready and the Friend fnumbled 
through the blanket. The new 
trolley was beside Alice its tiny oc- 
cupant covered with a white sheet. 
For a brief moment she felt pity — 
then her gaze was snatched away .

ALICE LANDER, HOMICIDE 

Alice Lander, homicide! Dear 
God, it was a homicide charge. The 
child had died. That meant a 
twenty-year sentence. That meant 
no childhood ever again, because 
she would be twenty physical years 
old before she was released from 
confinement. Then the remaining 
twenty years of adult life. Then 
total death. If Phillip and the nurse 
failed to notice the indicator board. 
If, during the next five minutes, 
they didn’t look that way. Once 
they had opened her skull and that 
of her new body they legally had to 
go through with it.

She was all alone now and she felt 
a gust of self-pity and she knew that 
they must notice the board. They 
couldn’t miss the board. The board 
was silently shouting at them, com- 
manding them to stop the 
operation, now, NOW! And Phillip 
was bending over her and he was 
saying something. The nurse held 
the helmet. She was fitting it over 
Alice’s head and Alice wondered: 
In a moment they will give me the 
shot and which body will I have 
when I wake up? Will they see the 
board before they start the trepan 
and will I wake up to find myself in 
the same body with only six months 
to live? Or in the body Phillip is un- 
covering? That tiny body — and 
forty years more of life? 

That body. She turned her head 
and saw that body, naked and 
small. 

It had a huge, livid crimson 
naevus on its cheek. It was an 
android child. 

Q UITE calmly Woman Alice 
Lander gestured the helmet 
away, swung her feet to the floor 
and stood up, while the nurse and 
Phillip watched, their faces stupid 
with astonishment. 

“No, I don’t think so,’’ she said. 
“This won’t do — it won’t do at all.” 
Her eyes were wide and she seemed 
almost to be smiling. She walked 
steadily across the room and took 
the Friend from beneath the 
blanket. They flinched as they 
watched and heard the screaming

obscentities and saw Alice swing 
the box against the wall once to 
quiet it. She walked toward them. 
The nurse backed away and Alice 
placed the box on the operating 
table. She turned and regarded 
them. Behind the indicator board 
flickered unnoticed. 

''Being of sound mind, ” she said 
quietly and with infinite control, 
“and being in the presence of two 
competent witnesses I, Woman 
Alice Lander hereby make over all 
my rights of future transfer to my 
present Friend, Betty Benson.” 

There was a startled exclamation. 
Then: “Why, thank you, my dear,” 
said the sightless box beside the 
android child. 

“And furthermore,” continued 
Alice, “having obtained permission 
for my own premature transfer, I 
require that the assigned transfer of 
Woman Betty Benson be carried 
out immediately.” Her voice began 
to falter at last. “Phillip,” she said 
unsteadily. “Please get me out of 
here.” 

He took her by the arm and led 
her down the corridor and into the 
sunlit bustle of the noisy street. He 
held her impersonally and walked 
stiffly, as though embarrassed. On 
the steps she turned and smiled at 
him and he winced at the emptiness 
behind her eyes. “Now you can buy 
me that drink, Phillip,” she said. 
‘‘Someone else can do the 
operation.” 

“I think not,” he replied, his 
countenance expressionless. He 



turned and walked back into the 
transfer center. 

She hardly noticed him go, but 
giggled a little at the thought of 
Betty Benson, of all people, waking 
up in an android body. Across the 
street a tall indicator board flashed 
above a police car from which a 
man and a woman were regarding 
her curiously.

She chuckled at that, too. She 
would have to telephone them im- 
mediately and set the record 
straight. There was a visiphone box 
on the corner. The board ought, of 
course, to read: alice lander, sui- 
cide. 

People turned and glanced at the 
woman who stood on the steps of 
the transfer center, whose wild, 
racking laughter constituted a 
disorderly intrusion into the hum- 
drum street sounds. •

T HE choice was to vote for 
Suspension or for Continua- 
tion. We were fully informed, a 
totally educated populace. We 
knew — though some refused to 
believe — that Continuation meant 
self-destruction. Suspension was an 
unknown. Our scientists believed it 
possible, but for many of us there 
was the fear that the salvation of 
suspending ourselves in time would 
certainly bring on the destruction 
that was only probable if we 
continued. 

The responsible choice, never- 
theless, was Suspension. The vote 
was overwhelming. 

It is frightening but we have 
reason and probability. We are con- 
fident that the universe is heavily 
populated. Unfortunately our 
orientation has been inward — we 
have never evolved our space travel 
beyond the speed of light. But in the 
universe of so many suns and so 
much debris there must be others. 
Most, certainly, are our inferiors — 
but within the strictures of chance 
some must be superior to us. 

The vote is an acknowledgment 
of reality. There was no other way 
for us to have voted. We underwent 
a brief, irresponsible flurry of" 
nonsense before the polling — the 
reconsideration^ massive surgery. 
But the basic argument against that 
was irrefutable. Where we are is not 
tenable, but where our ancestors 



were one hundred and twenty-nine 
thousand years ago was where we 
would have returned if we had 
utilized surgery — and where our 
ancestors stood was totally 
untenable. 

Our problem is that we have 
evolved an ultimate system for sur- 
vival. We are certainly the greatest 
experiment in coexistence — given 
our limitations, given the reality of 
our nature. But we have reduced 
ourselves to the single strength- 
flaw. So we must suspend 
ourselves, we must wait. One day 
the best of the universe will reach 
us, retrieve us from our suspension, 
will instruct us how to make 
ourselves perfect and prepetual. 

The vote went as it had to go. 

Now some still speak nonsense. / 
Some talk of using caretakers, 
keeping a minimal force in 
satellites or even in specially 
protected places on our planetary 
surface. It is impossible. If we leave 
couples they will reproduce and 
then we would have the reversion 
we do not want. If we leave single 
persons — how will it be possible for 
them to survive? 

So our Authority is taking the 
only actions that are reasonable 
and possible. Satellites are being 
sent on infinity probes. They are 
broadcasting our location, our 
situation, our call for help. And 
local satellites within our system 



NEXT TIME 



89 




are being placed in full-coverage 
orbits to warn the universe of our 
danger and our need. We have set 
aside great areas, cleared them, 
erected massive plinths of our 
indestructible blue rock to tell the 
story of our 229,000 years of 
recorded civilization. Markers, per- 
petual beacons, radio and X and 
light rays are emplaced to draw at- 
tention to these areas we call His- 
tory Plots. 

Now, for us, the only remaining 
problem is where we want to be at 
the end. And how long will the end 
last? Will it be a century, a millen- 
nium, ten thousand or a hundred 
thousand years? There is no way for 
anyone to know. And it is an im- 
portant question. Do we stay in our 
beds for the duration or will that 
encourage deterioration? Ten to 
twenty-five per cent of us will not 
be compatible with suspension. 
None of us want to die. So do we 
remain in our houses, our 
buildings? Is it best to be sitting or 
standing? Will our constructions 
collapse on us after twenty thou- 
sand years? Would it be best to go 
out into our fields or better to end it 
all walking along our streets? And 
what effect will fifty or seventy or 
ninety thousand summer suns, 
winter snows, spring rains, autumn 
winds have on us? 

All the above I have written for 
posterity. 



iiTTARIK. I love you,” Ver- 
X nika told me. We were 
holding hands, walking oyer the 
fields of cydiyod. The truthor were 
in bloom, the trees had the fat full 
leaves of summer — the waterfalls 
dropped their great showers of 
crystal and the stream ran first 
white cold and then ice clear. 

“I love you better,” I told her. 

“Are you afraid?” she asked. She 
looked into my eyes. She didn’t 
trust my answer. 

“Yes.” I told her the truth. “A 
little.” 

“Why? Don’t you think one day 
it will be over?” 

“I don’t know. If we come out of 
it by ourselves — and that could 
happen — we’ll simply return to 
where we are. The only hope is that 
some beings wiser than we exist out 
there.” I looked at the sky. “The 
probabilities are that they must 
exist — but what guarantee do we; 
have? Worse — what guarantee do< 
we have that a race of great in- 
telligence with the technology to 
reach us will have the genius or the 
values to help us?” 

“It’s so depressing, Itarik. Some- 
times I could just detonate.” 

“No. Not you. Never.” 

“You’re right. But what happens 
then? Do we just wait through 
eternity?” 

“If we’re unlucky. If we’re lucky, 
maybe tomorrow someone drops

IF 




by. Who knows? I surely don’t.” 
“You’re going to be at the His- 
tory Plot, aren’t you?” 

“You know that the ones chosen 
are not permitted to tell.” 

“But I want to be with you.” 

“You wait with your family, If 
anything happens — you know I’ll 
hurry to you.” 

“It’s a tremendous honor that 
you were chosen. Just think, when 
they come you will be the first 
contact.” 

“If I were a Selected One and if 
they chose to descend at our His- 
tory Plot.” 

“Oh, you know they will. It’s the 
biggest and it’s nearest to our big- 
gest city. Of course they will.” 
“Let’s finish our picnic and then 
get on. We really don’t have much 
time — not any more.” 

“How much time?” 

I looked at my time recorder and 
told her. 

“I’m afraid.”^ 

“No, you’re not. We’re together 
and we will be and nothing will ever 
hurt you. I promise.” 

On the way back to the city we — 
of course — waved and communi- 
cated with everyone we passed. We 
knew many we saw. We said hello 
to friends and to strangers, too. We 
wished everyone well. 

It was strange when we landed 
and walked — took our final walk — 
how clean and how beautiful 



everything was. We looked at 
everything. Scenes we had taken for 
granted we suddenly saw anew and 
admired. Our architecture made an 
intelligent being’s heart soar. Our 
streets were beautiful. Our gardens 
satisfied the soul. 

“We keep our pride,” I told Ver- 
nika'. “However badly we’ve 
failed — you know? I can’t get it out 
of my head, seeing it all— -how 
special, how enormous our 
accomplishment.” 

Vernika was more beautiful than 
at any time before in her life, for 
me. We stopped at our loving place. 
Her lips were softer, her body 
radiated more warmth, her eyes 
sparkled with more brilliance, her 
love was total, complete. 

And then we went and said 
goodbye to my family. We did it 
well. We ajl behaved well. And for 
our finish we went to Rilluksik’s. 
We sat at a table old fat Rilluksik 
himself pushed aside for us. We 
smiled and wished him well and he 
wished us well. 

“The usual,” I told Tiklap after 
the proper exchange. 

The great glow sign radiated its 
message through the square. It 
really was just the one message, 
repeated. It expressed the wish and 
gave the time. Time was no longer 
progression from but time 
remaining. 

This was our last night, a special 



NEXT TIME 



91 




night. There were special things for 
us. From ancient times there were 
resurrections. A newspaper labeled 
extra, printed on indestructible 
modern material, was brought . 
along and sold by small androids. 
They shouted the word “Extra” 
and'called out “Read all about it.” 
We bought one, as did everyone. 
The headline was big and dark. It 
read the farewell from the Au- 
thority and then the Universal 
Wish: UNTIL NEXT TIME. 

We watched the glow sign and 
our own time recorders. We stared 
into each other’s eyes. We held 
hands and spoke our oaths. We 
finished our drinks and then — 
saying goodbye to everyone, 
shaking hands, smiling, speaking 
the Universal Wish again and 
again — we finally broke away. 

I walked Vernika home for the 
last time. 

I was one of the Selected. Twelve 
of us on the planet. I hurried to my 
History Plot. There was one for 
each of our continents. It was dif- 
ficult getting through, but I had a 
means. There were many who had 
chosen to be near the Plot, to be 
near the one I had— but I would be 
within it and would stay until 
someone or something came. 

When I got in I checked the bea- 
cons, the transmitters of X and 
light and radio. I made certain the 
time recorder was fully functioning. 

92 



We had infinity probes out in every 
quadrant. Our system was totally 
covered by full information 
satellites and I thought— still — that 
it would just be luck if we were 
found. 

The finish was a great sky show. 
A million colors flashed and soared 
and burst, filling the sky with ex- 
citement and beauty — all inci- 
dentally visible for many light- 
years. The display continued, kept 
getting deeper and richer and more 
beautiful. And the time kept ap- 
proaching the final moment. 
Everything gained intensity. Then 
came the most spectacular burst. 
The words themselves were 
somehow spelled out. And I 
thought how all around our 
planet — everywhere — all of us were 
seeing it: 

UNTIL NEXT TIME 

And then the sky went quiet. 
There was enough time for the eyes 
to rest and adjust and all the 
universe, all the stars, all the 
galaxies stood out there clear and 
promising. 

And then it was just a great white 
burst — a new sun. 

T HE Kydecton B Starship auto- 
matically detected the in- 
telligently ordered X-ray. It ap- 
proached the planet and stood off, 

IF 




attempting to decipher the quadri- 
digital satellite warning system. 
From orbit it rudely evaluated the 
planetary condition, situation and 
support system and then made the 
determination to follow the 
satellite’s advice as to landing site. 
It chose the primary, the one 
nearest the largest city. Its scouts 
discovered the planetary life form 
in a state of full suspension. They 
carried the first available form back 
to the Kydecton B Starship for 
biomedical investigation. 

N EXT TIME was the finish of 
the shell burst, the life and 
completion of the new sun. It was a 
fogginess, a haze, a confusion and 
then there was sight. I felt older, 
more tired, as if my lungs were 
worn and my heart exhausted. 
Above me was a light of a shape 
and intensity I didn’t know. Its 
frame, too, was different. The 
ceiling of the room was oval and cu- 
riously alien to me. But I re- 
membered who I was. 

I lowered my eyes and only just 
managed to control my emotion. A 
grotesque creature stood over me, 
looking down. I was on some kind 
of table. The creature was offen- 
sively ugly and totally alien. It was 
hunchbacked. It had odd 
protuberances and a surface that I 
could not recognize or identify. 
And then I thought — or perhaps it 



was just a hope — that the being was 
not a being but a type of robot. 

”1 am Itarik,” I said, my speech 
mechanism rusty with disuse. 

"Cli dy Itarik," it said. 

“We have a great problem. I will 
explain if you can understand.’’ 
"Cl-ee’ pho TinPla. Cli za aac er 
cl’-ee mii qu-uem." 

“Do you understand me?” 

"Sa cl’-ee qu-uem cle it seemed 
to repeat. And then it turned. 
“Type 6743, variation R240Y.” 

I twisted my head. It was a robot. 
It was speaking to a humanoid 
type. Its object was clearly female, 
obvious mammalian. Its dress was 
far different and much less modest 
than clothing styles of our planet. It 
had a sickly, horrid coloration. It 
was ugly because of that and be- 
cause of animal fur or featherings 
that grew from its crown and fell 
over its shoulders. If its color had 
not been so nauseating and its fur 
or feathers not present, however, I 
thought its basic structure was 
sound and not unattractive. 

“You understand me now?” 

" Cl’-ee qu-uem — ” the robot 
began. 

“Enough. I understand,” the fe- 
male being said. She came over to 
me and looked down. “Your name 
is Itarik. You are an intelligent 
being; My words are clear to you?” 
“I understand you. I am 
responsible for explanation' and,

amplification of the plinths. They 
are there and understood?*’ 

“They are there. Your language 
we have not deciphered. It will be 
easier for you to explain — or would 
you prefer to give us the key to your 
written language and have us first 
read your plinths?’’ 

“Since I’ve survived, perhaps I’d 
better explain. Could you tell me 
the year? 

“How? We do not know your 
dating system.’’ 

“I apologize. There is — or was— 
a perpetual time recorder in the 
center of the plinths. I wondered 
whether you had noticed it.’’ 

“No. Could I have understood it? 
My name is Linma. This is our 
cybernaut, nameless. The superior 
is Raad. Are you dangerous or can 
you be freed?’’ 

“I’m not aggressive. However, 
our problem is that each of us is a 
self-detonatable fusion device. We 
are controlled by free will, activated 
by threat. I am specifically trained. 
I have extraordinary control.’’ 

“You are a bomb, an explosive 
device?*’ she asked. 

“Yes. We all are. It is our 
problem.’’ 

“Where do you carry this 
weapon? How do you carry it?’’ 
“You see the incision. Each of us 
had the weapon implanted on 
reaching maturity.’’ 

She looked at the robot and then 



at me and then at the robot again. 
Very quickly she expressed some- 
thing in her language. The robot 
responded by monosyllable. 

^‘Very well. We will release you. 
We have our defenses. I recom- 
mend you exercise caution.’’ 

T HEY unstrapped me. Slowly I 
rose. I tottered on my feet. I 
had to hold to the table to maintain 
my balance and then my energy 
returned and I looked around the 
curious oval room. 

Linma was small. The robot was 
my size. The room was simple, 
utilitarian, large, but quite bare. 
“Follow me, please.’’ 

A door appeared, a section of the 
wall opened. We entered a 
passageway and then strode down a 
ramp and again I was whole. I saw 
our sun. My feet touched our 
planet’s surface. The cydiyod and 
the truthor had grown, had lived. 

I knew a surging joy, a happiness. 
We had reached Next Time. The 
plinths stood. I hurried to the 
eternal time recorder and involun- 
tarily gasped. It read: 263.482.109. 
031.586. The space between Old 
Time and Next Time had been 34,- 
000 years. And I was alive! Ver- 
nika? My family? My friends? 

A strange small surface vehicle 
materialized from nowhere. A male 
being, presumably Raad, seemed to 
be in control of it. His color

repelled me and his fur or 
featherings were even mo^e ex- 
tensive than Linma’s. He spoke to 
Linma. His tone was aggressive and 
unpleasant. His very look and ap- 
pearance had indecency, frustration 
and animalistic savagery. I knew 
that I had to make allowances, but 
I thought I did not like him. 

“Itarik, no?” he asked. 

“Yes. And you are Raad. I see 
that we have waited thirty-four 
thousand years for you to come.” 

“Year is solar orbit?” 

“Yes.” 

He spoke to Linma. They had a 
lengthy exchange. The robot, too, 
was involved. Raad seemed to be 
interrogating them, but every time 
Linma tried to speak he interrupted 
her. Repeatedly he asked the robot 
questions and the robot swiftly 
answered. Raad kept snapping at 
them — his tone was master to slave. 

“You are trained to explain your 
situation better than these plinths?” 
he asked me, waving his hand. 

“I am.” 

“Good. Come,” he said and then 
hurried the three of us into the ve- 
hicle with him. Instantly we started 
off, moving toward the city. 

I asked, “Do you wish me to 
explain now?” 

“When I am ready I will tell 
you.” 

I winced. A threatening rudeness 
approached lethal level. But I 



managed to restrain my temper. 

Linma looked at me. Her mouth 
moved in the form of a grimace, but 
I saw in her eyes that it was her 
manner of smiling, of giving 
reassurance. 

We went slowly. The land, I 
thought, had changed and yet it was 
the same. My fellow planetarians 
surprised me. We passed by those 
who had been close to the History 
Plot, waiting for early resurrection. 
So many things struck me. How 
perfect they wer$, how entire, how 
untouched. And how incredible it 
was. 

Knowing for so long the precise 
moment of stasis how few of them 
were in relaxed or even rational 
positions. They seemed unpre- 
pared, surprised. They were statues 
in half turnings, statues with arms 
outraised, statues standing on one 

leg- 

As we went on I almost wept. It 
was like an endless procession of 
dioramas, but the backgrounds and 
foregrounds were real. Almost 
every head was back, almost all. 
eyes were lifted to the sky. I 
thought, how enormously im- 
pressive. Of course it was just that 
we had all been looking at the sky 
show, but it Looked to be expec- 
tation and hope and even faith. 

But there was diversity. Most 
heads were raised but the few that 
were not were more poignant. 



NEXT TIME

There was a mother stooping to a 
small child. We passed an old man 
attempting to read his time 
recorder. A very young, kneeling 
woman was offering some token to 
a little grklo, one of our small 
animals. 

I looked at Raad and Linma. 
Their faces showed nothing — as if 
they did not care and were 
indifferent. 

W E STOPPED. We got out. 

Raad ordered the robot to do 
something to a young man standing 
by the road. The robot listened, 
then produced and attached sensors 
to the man, reported, went on to a 
woman not far away, attached 
sensors, reported, went on to others 
to repeat the process. 

Raad watched and smiled and 
then, still smiling, he went from one 
to the next and on. He kicked the 
young man. He cruelly squeezed 
the breast of the woman. He 
punched at the stomach of the next 
person. His, actions were brutal and 
shocking. I watched and my anger 
flared, blit I controlled it. 

I watched as he went oh, then 
listened as he discussed the sensor 
readings with the robot. I held my 
tongue but if he represented sal- 
vation I thought 1 could feel my 
hope diminish. 

The city was still there, still beau- 
tiful. Much destruction had hap- 



pened. Pieces and even entire com- 
plexes of our buildings had fallen. 
Our walks and roads had cracked. 
Much was buried under layers of 
our planet’s surface. It surprised 
me alternately that so much was 
intact and that anything was intact. 

Much was tarnished, though. 
Features that I remembered had 
rotted. Structures that for me had 
gone up new yesterday were ancient 
ruin. 

I thought, if only we had 
conceived how our tragedy was to 
end. But the end of Old Time — 
yesterday — had seemed so clean. 
We hadn’t grasped what thirty-four 
thousand years would do to what 
we had made, to what we had 
prized. 

There were the dead. Bodies 
partially decomposed or just 
remnants of them in small piles 
where they had stood and died and 
rotted away. 

I was tom, looking at my com- 
panions, at the city, at the streets 
Filled with my people waiting to be 
brought back to life. We drove on. 
We said nothing. A bird, stilled, 
waited. Gtklos, their tails between 
their legs, were frozen in the act of 
running from the exploding sky. A 
child, mouth open, eyes squeezed 
taut, face empurpled was crying 
silently. A man stood, blowing his 
nose. 

I wondered how Vernika was. I 



96 



IF 




wondered how my family was. I 
wondered what my companions 
were and what capacities and in- 
telligence and compassion they had. 

T HE glow sign had fallen, there 
was not even a trace of it. It 
was as if it had never been. The 
fountain had crumbled in on itself. 
The monument had toppled. 
Rilluksik’s awning had partially 
fallen, but the lurla chairs and 
tables were intact and untouched, 
they were only dirty, dusty. 

Rilluksik was still there. He, of 
course, had not looked at the sky 
show. He had been taking a final 
drink, making a final toast. The 
liquid had evaporated from his 
glass. 

We sat at a table there, two tables 
from where' I had last been with 
Vernika. 

The robot went inside and 
quickly came back to us with 
glasses and bottles. They had 
remained. For 34,000 years they 
had remained. The robot opened 
the bottles, somehow analyzed 
them, chose the fourth and poured 
for us. We sipped at the truthor 
wine. 

Raad said, “Primitive, but not 
bad.” 

Linma said something in her 
tongue. She did not like the taste, I 
thought. 

“Now, boy, what’s your name?” 



“Itarik,” I told him. Had he 
forgotten? 

“Yes.” Of course. Tell your 
story.” 

How could I begin? Where was 
the place to start? We had trained 
to expect the kindness and warmth 
of saviors, not antagonism. 

“Very well. This, I believe, is our 
year 263,482. We are an advanced, 
mature civilization. For the past 
34,000 years we have been as you 
found us, suspended. 

“One hundred and sixty-four 
thousand six hundred and fifty-one 
years ago this began. Our popu- 
lation had grown beyond pur con- 
trol and beyond our resources.” 

“What is your population now?” 

“Now, I cannot say. It was 
slightly more than twelve billion 
yesterday.” 

“Excellent. Continue.” 

“Our planet, back then, was 
fouled by waste. I remind you I 
speak of very old time, before our 
first one hundred thousand years. 
Our economy was irrational. Our 
society was splintered. Crime, 
disease, starvation, aggression and 
discontent had grown insup- 
portably. So in those years we were 
constantly at war. We had a neigh- 
boring planet. They were our 
equals, as advanced as we. Their 
weapons were as sophisticated and 
destructive as ours. In the end we 
fought the most terrible war of our 



NEXT TIME 



97 




history. Our population was 
seventy-three billion when it began. 
When it ended four billion of us 
were alive. Our enemies were an- 
nihilated. Their planet no longer 
exists — we destroyed it. 

“Here we had little left but ruins. 
A few of our cities had escaped, but 
most of the planet was . ravaged. 
Our very surface was charred. And 
if we had been crippled with our old 
population — with only the four 
billion we were helpless. We could 
not support ourselves. The Au- 
thority did all that it could. 
Introductory — ” 

“Authority is your government?” 

“Yes. But even as we tried to 
preserve ourselves we realized that 
if we could survive at all our history 
would simply repeat. In time we 
would grow fat again and too 
many — in time aggressiveness and 
belligerence would mount again. In 
time we would kill ourselves — 
finally. 

“So our authority evolved a new 
system. It did not apply to survivors 
of the great war — they were judged 
to be hopelessly poisoned. But it 
did apply to their children. Spe- 
cial educational programs were 
evolved. Constant methods of 
testing were devised. When a child 
graduated from our new schools he 
was taken to surgery and within 
him and wired to his brain a 
miniaturized bomb was im- 



planted— a Rytlatt-N. This tiny 
weapon was detonatable only by an 
act of will by its possessor. At first 
it was planned to have physically 
destructive force in order to sustain 
industry but finally it was decided 
to use the N weapon. Buildings and 
property were not destroyed — only 
life was destroyed. Life was 
destroyed within a radius almost 
embracing this city. 

“Each of us was armed. Each of 
us was suddenly dangerous. A 
criminal would not dare to strike — 
a rapist could not risk an at- 
tack. An enemy would not dare to 
threaten us and we could not 
injure, torture, hurt, sadden. Be- 
cause of the Rytlatt-N there was 
suddenly no alternative to total 
responsibility.” 

“What of the inadequate — what 
of the ones who failed the tests?” 

“Liquidation. There was no al- 
ternative to that cruelty — but it was 
a lesser barbarity. Earlier we had 
murdered our best in wars — with 
the new system we only eliminated 
our failures and had fewer and 
fewer. 

“At first it was all confusing. If a 
man wanted a woman — could she 
dare to refuse him? But if she were 
unwilling — could- he dare to take 
her? Could a thief be denied? There 
were many problems. But it 
worked. Suddenly a neighbor’s hurt 
was an intolerable risk and threat. 



98 



IF 




Despair could mean quick self- 
detonation. People had to be 
helped, eased, soothed, comforted. 
A stranger could not be ignored. A 
hungry man could not be neglected. 
No one could cheat or afford a 
dishonesty. A parent could not be 
disobeyed but a parent could not be 
irresponsible because that might es- 
tablish trauma and that might one 
day be precedent for rage. 

“The hope was that since we did 
not respect each other we would 
have to respect the Rytlatt-N in 
each other — and in time it might 
occur to all of us that the threat, the 
power, the majesty was not at all in 
the Rytlatt-N, but in ourselves.” 

“Continue,” Raad commanded. 

“All was well. It was a Golden 
Age. We could not overproduce, it 
might hurt our neighbor. We could 
not aggressively grasp for ad- 
vantage, it might prove lethal to us. 
We could not pollute — we could 
not be anything but human, 
responsible, civilized. Because, you 
see, everywhere we went, though 
languages and customs varied on 
our planet, we had the universality 
and commonality of power.” 

“So you went' on with that, you 
progressed, grew, continued, had 
your golden age. Then what 
happened?” 

I looked at him. I was trained to 
explain, but I didn’t know how be- 
cause we hadn’t had adequate 



explanation. “Perhaps it was 
boredom or absurdity or maybe it 
was just excess. Suddenly, in those 
last two hundred years, the new 
generations saw how ridiculous we 
had become. We could not com- 
fortably sit at a cafe table because 
someone else might come who 
wanted to sit there. We could not 
reprimand an incompetent because 
he might be offended. We could not 
understand each other because 
understanding courts the risk of 
hurt. We could not assert ourselves. 
We could not even afford true 
achievement. We could not grow. 

“And from that, in desperation 
and frustration, many went insane. 
We had to develop ' means of 
defusing them. But insanity was en- 
demic and epidemic. Suddenly we 
went back to being again the sane 
and the insane, the responsible and 
the irresponsible. The rapist was 
there and he struck again. He didn’t 
care and the victim who did care, 
who was sane, who had a sense of 
responsibility, couldn’t destroy a 
million people for the momentary 
pain, the hurt feeling, the sense of 
injustice. It just didn’t merit self- 
destruction. And then it became 
clear that nothing merited self- 
destruction. No crime, from the 
point of view of a responsible 
person, justified the annihilation of 
a city. 

“We discovered that we were so 



NEXT TIME 



99 




powerful we were impotent. We at- 
tempted various means to change 
that, but we failed. And we had 
evolved too far to watch ourselves 
destroyed. Basically we were too 
accomplished an animal to throw 
ourselves away. But we had no in- 
telligence brilliant enough, we had 
no adequate answer — we were able 
to find no alternate system for 
survival. 

“So we voted to suspend 
ourselves. We sent through the 
universe our call for help. Now you 
have come. Perhaps you or your 
civilization will help us.” 

He — Raad — looked at me and 
then at Linma, who seemed to 
understand and be moved by our 
tragedy. I didn’t know what their 
civilization was, but everywhere 
around where we sat at Rilluksik’s 
the evidence of our greatness was 
undeniable. Raad frowned, turned 
to the robot and sharply inter- 
rogated it. After each answer, Raad 
seemed simply to repeat his 
question. But each time the robot 
answered as he had before. 

At last Raad looked back at me. 
His eyes were hooded. He grimaced 
and whispered in an almost friendly 
tone, “We’ll help you, boy.’’ 

“You have an answer for us?’’ 

He smiled “1 have an answer.” 

W E WENT back to their ship. 
They locked me into the 



room where I had first entered 
Next Time. Raad .had said he 
wanted me to rest while he investi- 
gated his plan for us. He had sud- 
denly turned gently patronizing. 

There was nothing in the room. 
The lamp and even the table were 
gone. The lighting was indirect — 
the room was inhuman. 

I waited impatiently and thought 
of remembering to ask them to let 
me go find Vernika. Their ship, 
their robot, their controls were un- 
deniable. Clearly they were an ad- 
vanced civilization. They would 
help us. We could begin again. It 
had been a terrible risk, a horrible 
chance, but we had survived. 

For a long time I waited. I 
examined myself again. I was well. 
I had undergone no adverse 
physical effects. 

There was the whisper of ma- 
chinery — then Linma hurried in. 

“Come with me. Hurry!” 

I didn’t question her. I followed 
her, quickly getting free of the ship. 
In the far distance I could just see 
Raad and the robot. They were 
coming toward us. She ran and 
yelled at me to hurry with her. We 
raced into the grove of trees and 
there she paused, turned. Her 
breath was short. 

“I can’t help you. I tried. You’ll 
have to find a way yourself. I think 
you are more advanced than we 
are.”

“I don’t believe that I 
understand.” 

“You have to get away. Run — 
run as far as you can. Raad is a 
slaver. We need slaves on our 
planet. We search everywhere to 
get more. Our system works on 
slavery.” 

“How does that — ” 

“He plans to enslave you all. 
He’s going to take you back to our 
planet as slaves.” 

I smiled at her. “But he can’t,” I 
told her. “We would destroy you. 
We may have been troubled and 
ineffective, but we wouldn’t tolerate 
enslavement. We would detonate. 
The first of us would be obligated to 
destroy you.” 

“No.” 

“What do you mean, no? Why 
not?” 

“Try to detonate yourself.” 

“Why? I have no provocation. I 
couldn’t.” 

“Try to detonate yourself.” 

“That’s not possible. There’s no 
reason.” 

She raised her hand and slapped 
me. She slapped my face and kept 
hitting me. But there was no anger 
in her blows. “Try to detonate 
yourself.” 

“I don’t understand you.” 

“You have no weapon. There is 
no Rytlatt-N. We tested you. We 
have examined the others. It’s a 
fraud. You have nothing.” 



“That is not possible. Perhaps it 
is beyond your means of analysis.” 
“It’s not beyond our means of 
analysis. You have nothing at all. 
We found your Authority’s records. 
You have never had any weapon in 
you. It was just a myth.” 

“No. I have proof that you are 
wrong. We had accidents.” 

“They were inventions. They 
were part of the fraud. Prove it. Try 
to detonate yourself. Hurry!” 
“Linma,” Raad called. 

“For your people, your planet. 
You must remain free to help them, 
to stop Raad. Try to detonate 
yourself!” 

“Linma. Where are you?” Raad 
yelled. 

“You are certain?” I asked her. 
“Hurry. You have no time. 
They’ll kill you. You’ve trained 
yourselves to be perfect slaves — 
even if you alone were your own 
masters. Raad wants you! Try to 
understand — and save your people!” 
I looked at her. She believed 
what she said was so. 

“No. Don’t think of me. You’re 
no threat to me. Nor to anyone. 
You’re already a slave — unless you 
escape!” 

I closed my eyes. I said aloud, “I 
want to be destroyed. I want to be 
destroyed. I want to be destroyed.” 
“Run!” Linma screamed at me. 
“Hurry! Run!” 

I ran. • 



NEXT TIME

T HE two men roamed my in- 
nards, their feet and voices 
ringing hollowly in my empty hold. 
Changes in the sounds told me 
when they twisted and bent to get 
by the plastic webs of dunnage. 

“Look at the pitted hull, the 
buckling bulkheads, the worn 
tubes. It’s good for nothing but 
scrap. Why, my firm could buy a 
brand new starship packing all the 
latest gear for what it would cost to 
put this old tub back into some- 
thing like shape.” 

Old tub, indeed. True, I had been 



in service for over ninety Earth 
years, but thanks to my near-light 
speed — and to Einstein’s predict- 
ed “implosion effect” that tele- 
scopes space and time — I had ac- 
tually aged only eighteen subjective 
years. I was a mere youngster. 

“All right. I won’t argue the 
point. What’s your best offer?” 
“Now you’re talking sense. You 
really ought to pay us to take it off 
your hands. It’s costing you plenty 
in spaceport fees just sitting here, 
but we’re willing to give you . .” 
Their voices and footsteps faded 



102 





as they walked out of my cargo 
hatch and down the ramp to the 
waiting robojeep. Still unaware the 
thing they were talking about had a 
mind and feelings of its own and 
had heard every word, they sped off 
to the terminal building. 

I was too young to die. Granted, 
parts of me were pitted, buckled, 
worn — but the real me was whole 
and hale. Those men were dooming 
me never again to rise from Earth, 
never again to streak through space 
and time, never again to reach new 
worlds. 

All at once I knew how Bud had 
felt. Bud had been my first commu- 
nications officer. In the lonely 
hours of his watch he had gotten 
into the habit of talking to me, not 
knowing he had stirred me into lis- 
tening. I remember how I had star- 
tled him by suddenly asking him a 
question. I had startled myself, too, 
on finding myself aware of mind 
forming out of matter — coming out 
of an electronic fog and all at once 
coalescing into something that 
could think: This is I. 

Bud had become excited. 

“Wait till people hear this — ” 
But he quickly calmed down and his 
voice had grown thoughtful. 

“I have a feeling we’d better keep 
this a secret. Okay?” 

“Okay.” 

We had had many pleasant con- 
versations during the quiet mo- 



ments of his spells of duty. All too 
soon these had ended. On our third 
return voyage we had run into a 
matter-scatter storm. Of all the 
crew and passengers Bud had got- 
ten whirled up the worst. He had 
been scrapped as a spaceman. 

E verything changed with 
Bud’s going. The corn-officer 
who followed Bud was a no- 
nonsense type. The first time I 
spoke up to greet him he swiftly 
pressed the recycle button. When I 
tried to explain that I was not 
malfunctioning he punched the 
feedback-oscillator button, sending 
a jolt of juice through my computer 
to set me right. You can bet I didn’t 
try to open any conversations after 
that. 

It would have been just as useless 
for me to have broken in on the two 
men dickering over my worth as 
scrap. Hey, wait! Listen to me! I 
don’t want to die! To their way of 
thinking I was only a thing and had 
no say in my fate. They could have 
thought they were listening to a re- 
cording. They would have been 
wrong. I was not a thing and I 
would have a say. 

What I wanted to say was. 
Excuse my exhaust. But how? I 
rested on Pad 61 and there I would 
remain helplessly — lacking the 
chemical fuel for lift-off and the 
liquid cesium for near-light speed to

the stars — till the salvage robots 
came to take me apart. Unless . 

The spaceport was an ever- 
expanding complex and the large 
numbers identifying the pads fitted 
into slots for easy rearranging. I 
scanned the tarmac. Yes, a mile 
east of me stood Pad 19 and my 
mind surged with pleasure to see 
the red fueling-alert light flash from 
the starship there. 

For what I had in mind I needed 
hands and legs. At once I thought 
of the servo-robot that did the deep- 
space emergency-repair work on 
my hull. I had never operated the 
thing on my own — I would have to 
learn fast and without too many 
mistakes. I located the proper cir- 
cuit, hooked into it and— click— I 
was seeing through its eyes. It stood 
in a niche in the maintenance com- 
partment along with the crew’s 
spacesuits and other gear. Clum- 
sily at first — till I caught op that it 
answered to the slightest thought of 
a move on my part — it unstrapped 
the restraining harness, stepped out 
of its niche and clumped on mag- 
netic soles the shortest way to the 
cargo airlock entrance. It strode 
down the ramp and made for the 
Pad 61 sign alongside. Carefully it 
drew the numerals from the slot, 
turned them upside down and slid 
them back into place. I flashed my 
fueling-alert light. 

I was barely in time. The delivery 



tractrain was already rolling Trom 
the fuel depot. It braked sharply 
midway between the two Pad 19s, 
its scanner swinging from one to the 
other, from the other starship to 
me. 

My servo-robot clumped toward 
the true Pad 19. I seethed at i tk un- 
gainly slowness, but I feared that if 
it ran it might overbalance, fall and 
lose more time than it gained. Too, 
I wanted it to avoid notice. But, no 
doubt answering the urgency in my 
mind, it made better time than the 
pace I consciously held it to. Before 
the tractrain could break out of its 
bewilderment and phone back for 
instructions my servo reached Pad 
19 and turned the numerals upside 
down. The tractrain stopped wa- 
vering. It started rolling again, 
heading .straight for me. 

The tractrain followed strict 
safety procedures as it coupled its 
hoses to my tanks. I burned with 
impatience. I had to be up and 
away before the master of the 
spacecraft on Pad 19 wondered 
what was holding up his ship’s 
refueling. 

By now my servo-robot had 
clumped back and stood strapped 
in its niche once more. As L 
switched it off I felt lonely for the 
first time. 

At last the tractrain uncoupled. I 
didn’t bother asking the- control 
tower for clearance. I would never 



104 



IF 




get it. I pulled up the outer hatch. 
There was no need to close the in- 
ner door of the airlock this time — 
no crew, no passengers — but out of 
habit I did so. 

Waiting only for the tractrain to 
pull far enough away, I scanned the 
blast area and lifted off. 

Pulling free of Earth, I trembled 
with power and something else. 
Though space was my true 
element — and indeed now my only 
hope — I felt a strange sense of loss 
and emptiness. I shook it off — no 
time for sentiment. I had to make 
good my getaway. 

I shot toward the sun’s flaring 
rim to put it between myself and 
Earth and l$t it help sling me out of 
the system. After that? To keep 
from leaving any logical clue for 
men pursuing me to follow, I de- 
cided to pick a course at random. I 
stabbed blindly into my astrogation 
tapes and found I would be heading 
for Eta Lyrae, the star men call 
Aladfar. , 

And after-that? All space and all 
time lay ahead of me and around 
me. I was free. Free to be and free 
to choose. Still, I felt that sudden 
tear (pronounce it tare , not tier) ^t 
leaving Earth this time. This time 
there would be no returning . Ever. 

I was an outlaw. 

«TTey-” 

XI All my intercom speakers 



were still on from my eavesdrop- 
ping on the two men roaming my 
innards only a few hours ago — a 
lifetime ago — back on Earth. The 
voice came from my maintenance 
compartment. At the same moment 
I grew aware that something had 
caught fire in the maintenance com- 
partment and that one of my re- 
flexes had handled it, spraying the 
room with water and putting out 
the flames. 

Again I switched on my servo. 
Through its eyes I saw an empty 
spacesuit carom off the walls while 
over the intercom I heard another 
cry of pain. Then the magnetic soles 
of the spaceboots touched the wall, 
took hold and the empty suit stood 
swaying as if in a wind. I didn’t 
believe in ghosts. Yet I knew I was 
witnessing some kind of presence. 

A charred and sodden mass of 
oily rags and cotton-waste floated 
into the servo-robot’s field of 
vision. Next came a globe of water 
that had snowballed as the 
sprinkler droplets met and stuck 
together. Finally another Figure 
sailed into view. 

A boy of about sixteen, soaking 
wet. 

1 understood what had happened. 
I had been too busy worrying about 
winding up on the scrap heap to 
notice his having slipped aboard. 
Kids often did. A spacesuit hanging 
in its niche made a handy hiding

place against detection by adults 
and never in the past had I minded. 
This time was different. I had a 
stowaway. 

The extra G’s of my sudden 
liftoff had blacked him out, most 
likely. When he had come to, 
panicky and dizzy, he had unzipped 
the spacesuit and kicked himself 
free of it, only to find weight- 
lessness making billiard balls of 
himself and the suit. 

Even so, he had somehow 
gathered the rags and waste and 
started a fire. Why fire? Not for 
light— my walls had built-in glow. 
It was bright enough in the main- 
tenance compartment to show me 
he looked gray with cold. No 
wonder — the compartment was on 
my night side as I angled toward 
the sun. 

Firing my torque nozzles, I gave 
my hull spin to equalize the 
temperature and create artificial 
gravity for the stowaway. He shot 
spreadeagled to the deck and the 
char and water splattered around 
him and on him. 

“Hey—” 

That didn’t call for an answer — it 
did make me realize I might have 
given him warning. I justified 
myself by thinking it served him 
right. After all, I had not invited 
him aboard. 

But now that I did have a human 
aboard I had to start recycling the 



air. And I could see a more worri- 
some problem ahead — how to pro- I 
vide him with food. I was having to - 
go to a lot of trouble for one me- 
dium-sized hellion. A firebug. Yet 
somehow I didn’t mind. 

He sat up carefully, waited a 
moment to see if anything more 
would happen, then got to his feet. 
When he found he could move 
around just as on Earth a smile 
played over his face and he stole to 
the door leading to the corridor. 

I made my voice boom. 

“Who are you, boy?” 

He jumped. If I could have I 
probably would have jumped, too — 

I had never sounded like that be- 
fore. My voice came from the in- 
tercom speaker on the wall, but 
looking around the boy saw the 
servo-robot’s eyes on him and 
spoke to it. 

“Tom. Tom Stope, sir.” 

“Don’t call that thing ‘sir.’ I’m 
talking to you.” 

He looked around again. 

“But where are you?” 

“All around you.” 

“Huh?” 

“I’m the ship. Call me Proteus.” 

A long silence, then, “Oh.” But I 
could see he did not understand or 
did not believe. I explained. He 
said, “Oh,” again, more satisfac- 
torily. 

Then full understanding and 
belief hit him.

IF 




“You mean we’re not going 
back?” 

“Not ever.” 

“But—” 

“I don’t mean to be mean, but no 
one asked you to come along. I’m 
not going back and that’s final. If 
you want to stay behind you can do 
so right now. Seal yourself in my 
lifeboat and I’ll eject you, give you 
a big boost back toward Earth — ” 
Then I remembered — the old 
landing-program tape had been 
pulled from the lifeboat and had 
not been replaced with a new one. It 
takes a bit of skill to spiral in ma- 
nually without burning to a cinder. 

“Wait. Do you know how to land 
a lifeboat?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Then you’ll have to learn. If you 
are ever to return to Earth you 
must do so on your own. You may 
leave in the lifeboat whenever you 
wish — after you have learned to 
pilot it to a safe landing. By then 
you’ll have to have learned astro- 
gation as well.” 

“Why’s that?” 

“Because we’ll be so far from the 
solar system that the sun will be lost 
among the other stars. Unless you 
can locate the sun and plot a 
course, you’ll never find your way 
back to Earth.” 

“Oh?” A pause, then quietly: 
“How do I leam?” 

“I’ll be your teaching machine. 



We’ll start boning you up on math 
and physics as soon as I set up the 
program.” 

The boy laughed suddenly. I 
broke in on the laughter. 

“Are you laughing at me?” 

“No, at myself. Here I thought I 
was running away from all that.” 

“All what?” 

“Having to learn a lot of dull 
stuff.” 

“Humans are so inefficient,, 
illogical and unstable. Not at all 
like machines.” 

I wasn’t aware I had thought 
aloud till I heard him answer. 

“But humans made the machine. 
We made you.” 

“Yes, yes. You must excuse me 
now. I have much to do.” I let him 
see the servo-robot’s gaze rest on 
the splatter of char and water on 
the deck and then on himself. 
“Meanwhile, I’d appreciate it if 
you’d clean up the mess. And your- 
self.” 

His head went back, as from a 
blow. 

“Aye-aye, sir.” 

I’m ashamed to say I enjoyed 
putting him in his place. 

I T WAS true I had much to do if 
I were to keep him alive, though 
I didn’t care to let him know that 
was what occupied me. In pre- 
paring for liftoff I had naturally 
given no thought to human needs.

Water I could purify over and over 
again. Food was another matter. 
On every other voyage I had grown 
vegetables in a huge tank. But as 
my owner had been planning to sell 
me for scrap he had not bothered to, 
reseed my hydroponics garden. 
And, of course, he had not 
restocked the galley. 

My lifeboat carried emergency 
rations, but they would be barely 
enough to see the boy back to Earth 
when the time came. Meanwhile 1 
had to find other resources. 

For this work I needed the servo- 
robot’s mobility. I made it unstrap 
itself, clump to the door and undog 
the door. 

The boy stopped mopping up. 

“Where are you going?” 

“I told youf I’m going toward 
Aladfar.” 

“I don’t mean you, Proteus , 1 
mean the robot.” 

“It is going to tidy up the rest of 
me.” 

“Oh?” He laughed as he went 
back to mopping up. “I keep for- 
getting you’re the ventriloquist and 
it’s the dummy.” 

Ventriloquist, indeed. That was 
hardly our relationship. I walked 
the servo-robot out with dignity. 
And “tidy up” was hardly the right 
phrase. “Scrounge” was more what 
I had in mind. And scrounge it did, 
looking and feeling around in every 
stowage space, locker and drawer. 



It came up with a surprising 
amount of stuff. There had been a 
whole grin of sweet teeth among the 
last crew. I found two dozen candy 
bars, three and a half boxes of 
cookies, five cases of soda pop and 
nearly seven hundred sticks of 
chewing gum. My last purser 
proved to have been a secret hypo- 
chondriac. The servo-robot brought 
to light in his quarter’s a treasure 
trove of vitamins and powdered 
protein drinks. I found more food 
supplements in the ship’s sick bay, 
plus plastic bottles of intravenous 
solutions which could prove handy 
as a last resort. My biggest — 
though smallest — haul was two 
packets of seeds. 

I did not stop there. The servo- 
robot vacuumed all the bedding and 
every last pocket and cuff of forgot- 
ten and abandoned clothing and 
when it had winnowed out the dust 
and the lint I had a small mountain 
of broken nuts and cracker crumbs, 
a dozen orange pips and two apple 
cores. 

There was still some nutrient so- 
lution in my hydroponics tank. Just 
to make sure I had the robot pour 
in one of the precious bottles of 
intravenous. There seemed to be 
enough excelsior in the tank to hold 
the roots if the seeds sprouted. I 
planted the packets of seeds, 
together with the orange pips and 
the apple seeds. 




Now I had time to think about, 
the present. I called the boy on the 
intercom. 

“Tom Stope.” 

“Yes, Proteus?" 

“Lunch time. Find your way to 
the messroom aft. Oh the captain’s 
table are a can of cream soda, a 
chocolate-nut bar — ” 

“Man, this is going to be great!” 

“ — and a multiple-vitamin tablet. 
And for afterward a sterilized 
toothbrush and a tube of 
toothpaste.” 

“Aye-aye, sir.” 

T OM didn’t complain, but I 
could tell he grew sick of the 
same old tired food day after day 
after day. By the time my hydro- 
ponics garden began to produce 
Tom was ready for the change. But 
no matter how you serve them up, 
peas are peas and cucumbers are 
cucumbers. The apples and oranges 
would be a long while coming. 

The first few days the boy had 
busied himself exploring my 
labyrinth of corridors and layers of 
decks. I myself had been too busy — 
shaping course, watching out for 
pursuit and putting myself in 
order — to pay him much mindjbut 
I could not help being awarfe of his 
running up and down companion- 
ways and along catwalks and 
poking into every last one of my 
compartments. After that I had 



kept him busy with his lessons, as 
much to keep his mind off his diet 
as- to teach. him how to make his 
way back to Earth. 

I found his spelling atrocious. He 
protested when I marked him 
wrong for spelling vacuum 
“vacwm.” True, that spelling had a 
screwy logic of its Own, but it was 
not the kind of logic 1 was used to. 
He swore foully under his breath. 

“I’ll tactfully ignore that,” I said. 
“Now let’s get on with the lesson, 
shall we, my young lexiconoclast?” 
I heard myself chuckle. I, too, 
could play on words. On leaving, he 
shut the classroom door with un- 
necessary force. But he showed up 
for the next class on time. 

One day he seemed very quiet. 
“What’s wrong, Tom?” 
“Nothing. It’s just that I’ve been 
crossing off the Earth days.” 

“Yes?” 

“And today’s my birthday.” 
“Happy birthday, Tom.” 
“Thanks, Proteus.” 

I said nothing more, but 
gradually increased the oxygen in 
the air, slowly brightened the glow 
of my bulkheads and he soon grew 
cheerful and chatty again. 

But I myself grew gloomier as the 
time neared for him to go. He had 
early showed an aptitude for 
piloting and I had checked him out 
step by step. He passed my tests 
with flying — or jetting — colors.

first simulating, then actually 
taking off in the lifeboat and 
practicing spiraling in on my hull. 
But it was not the same as landing 
in atmosphere. One last test, then, 
before he left me for good. 

We were near Ostrakon, an 
Earthlike planet of a sunlike star. 
The United Galaxy had placed it 
off limits, but I was already a 
desperado and the tapes described 
Ostrakon as having developed only 
vegetable life. There would be no 
people on the lookout for an outlaw 
spaceship and there would be plenty 
of food and water if Tom crash- 
landed and had to spend any length 
of time on the planet. 

“Listen, Bud — ” 

“Bud? It’s Tom, remember?” 
“Sorry, Tom. A slip of the tape.” 
I showed him Ostrakon on the 
screen in the control room. “Button 
up in the lifeboat. You’re going to 
make a real landing.” 

“Man!” 

It dampened him a little when I 
insisted on sending along the servo- 
robot so I could keep an eye on 
him. But he buoyed up when I put 
myself in orbit around Ostrakon 
and told him he could launch when 
ready. Whoosh! 

I needn’t have been anxious — he 
made a neat landing. He got out. I 
had the servo-robot follow. I spoke 
over the lifeboat’s talkbox. 

“Don’t stray too far.” 



“I won’t.” Tom drew a deep deep 
breath. “Fresh air!” 

“What’s wrong with my air?” 
“Nothing, Proteus, nothing. 
Only—” 

The lifeboat’s retro-rockets must 
have vaporized much of the 
moisture in the landing area. A 
nearby tree flapped great leathery 
leaves, tore itself loose from the soil 
and flew a hundred yards away to' 
sink its talon-like roots into moister 
soil. 

“ Proteus , did you see that?” 
Something troubled me, some- 
thing I should have known about 
Ostrakon. 

“Very interesting, but the pur- 
pose of the exercise is not sight- 
seeing. Return to ship.” 

A slow: “Aye-aye, sir.” 

Tom and the servo-robot but- 
toned up again. The lifeboat lifted 
off. Without my prompting him, 
Tom let the spin of the planet help. 

I was proud. I secretly forgave him 
for turning away from the controls 
for a farewell glance at Ostrakon. 

“Hey! Look down there, Proteus. 
Do you see it?” 

I SAW it. Someone had very 
recently burned or stomped a 
huge SOS in the grass. Tom deftly 
changed course and homed the life- 
boat in on the SOS. I remembered 
suddenly why Ostrakon was off 
limits. 



110 



IF 




“Come back, Tom.” 

“ Proteus ! Someone needs help.” 

Before I could say more he had 
made another neat landing. Right 
in the bull’s eye of the S.O.S. 
He unbuttoned quickly and hopped 
out. I had the servo-robot follow 
with more dignity. 

Through its eyes I saw nothing 
but treeline all around. 

Tom cupped both hands around a 
loud: “Hello — ” but no one 

answered. 

All at once a clump of trees took 
off in a scatter, uncovering a man 
who lay on the ground training a 
beamgun on Tom and the servo- 
robot. The man had been lying in 
ambush, no doubt waiting to make 
sure all the landing party had left 
the shelter of the lifeboat. 

For some reason of their own, 
perhaps out of a wish to warn us, 
perhaps simply out of dislike for the 
man, the trees had given him away. 

He stood up, wiped a look of em- 
barrassment from his face and 
holstered his beamgun. 

“Just wanted to make sure you’re 
friendly.” 

He had a spellbinding voice and a 
winning smile. But I could still feel 
that beamgun pointing at me. Too, 
an automatic alarm programed 
somewhere among my tapes had al- 
ready begun feeding me infor- 
mation regarding his identity. 

The top executive’s uniform he 



wore — in the style of a generation 
ago— had stained and frayed badly, 
but was nevertheless recognizable 
and suited his proud bearing. To 
look just as he did thirty years be- 
fore, as I later found in a thorough 
search of my history videotapes, he 
must have dyed his hair with vege- 
table dye that he had made himself 
for himself. This vanity, too, helped 
to betray him. He smiled at Tom. 

“Glad someone finally came. I’ve 
been shipwrecked’ here a long 
time.” 

He had edged closer to the life- 
boat and by now must have seen it 
was empty. 

It took me a full minute to break 
the spell his personality had cast 
over me. I reminded myself I was 
my own boss and before he came 
any nearer I spoke through the life- 
boat’s talkbox. 

“That is not — repeat not — so. 
Now hear this, Tom. This man is 
“Baron” Ur. He is an exile. It is 
against the law to have dealings of 
any kind with him. Tom, hop into 
the lifeboat. This planet is off-limits 
because of him.” 

I was too late. The man had 
pulled the beamgun again and was 
aiming it at Tom. 

“Don’t move.” 

He swung the beam around and 
snapped two shots at one of the 
trees that had given him away and 
had rerooted nearby. 



CALL ME PROTEUS

Its two winglike boughs on either 
side were sheared off close to the 
slender trunk and a moan like the 
wind went through. all the trees and 
I knew it was doomed to remain 
where it stood till it died. I winced 
for it. Never to fly again. 

The man smiled again at Tom. 

“That’s to show you two things. 
The beamgun is loaded and I mean 
business.’’ He nodded pleasantly. 
“Your friends aboard the space- 
ship — by the lettering on the life- 
boat I see it’s the old Proteus — are 
right. I am indeed Baron Ur.” 

H AMILTON UR had been a 
.stock market wheeler- 
dealer — my tapes had a lot on him 
for instant use — a whiz at pyr- 
amiding an interest in one com- 
pany into control of many. He had . 
stuck together a great con- 
glomerate, one of the biggest on 
Earth — actually he had shown 
himself full of energy v and vision. 
But he had misused his paper 
empire. He had corrupted 
government officials — Earth Gov- 
ernment had convicted him of 
bribery, stock manipulation and a 
dozen other offenses. 

Even so, he would have been 
nothing to me but a vague reference 
in my memory banks, but for the 
fact that the Arm that had owned 
me had been part of his financial 
empire. I thought it a nice turn of 



fate that put me on the top now. 

Tom’s eyes shone. He was face to 
face with living history. He seemed 
unaware of the beamgun's threat. I 
had to break the spell. 

“Ah,” I said. “So this is where 
they sent you.” 

I inched the servo-robot closer to 
Baron Ur as the man’s mind went 
back thirty years. An easy enough 
jump for him, I suppose — he had 
had thirty years to brood over it. 

“Sent? I chose to come. Oh, the 
judges let me choose. They would 
do things to my mind to make me 
fit to live among the rabble— or 
they would allow me to go into soli- 
tary exile. As you can see, I chose 
exile.” 

While his mind was full of what it 
considered injustice. I jumped the 
servo-robot at Ur. 

But Ur proved too alert, too 
quick. He dodged the reaching 
arms and aimed the beamgun at the 
servo-robot’s eyes. That was the 
last I saw. Before I could blink their 
shields the beamgun crackled and 
the servo-robot went blind. My 
only excuse is that the distance 
from orbit to ground made my 
reaction time too long. 

Ur’s voice told me what was 
going on. 

“The young man gets it next if 
you don’t let me come aboard.” 

“All right. Lift off and come 
aboard.” 



112 



IF 




Looking back, I can see I did not 
even think of taking the logical 
course, which would have been 
simply to go on my way alone, 
fully automated master of myself. I 
waited for Ur and Tom and the 
blind servo-robot to leave Ostrakon 
and come aboard. 

They passed through the airlock. 
Ur stepped carefully into my in- 
terior, no doubt holding the 
beamgun on Tom. 

“Where’s everybody?” 

That was when Baron Ur found 
out that I was everybody. He re- 
mained silent a minute, then 
laughed loudly and long. Very hu- 
miliating for me. Ur had Tom show 
him around my innards. 

I’m sorry to say only one thing 
impressed Ur. “Peas and cucum- 
bers! Apples and oranges! 
Paradise!” 

But when he finished the tour he 

l 

spoke to me in a voice full of feeling 
that was catching. I seemed to swell 
with prospects and surge with 
power, just listening. 

“We can do great things 
together, Proteus: You and I and 
this fine young man.” He seated 
himself in the captain’s chair and 
pressed the button to flash the star- 
chart display on the control room 
wall. “Very well, we’ll shape course 
for Tarazed. That’s Gamma 
Aquilae, a star with a bunch of 
planets ripe for plucking.” 



W 'E WERE still orbfting 
Ostrakon. Clearing the decks 
for the leap toward Tarazed, I had 
the servo-robot feel its way back to 
its niche and strap in. You may be 
wondering why I didn’t protest. It 
was tempting to hand over respon- 
sibility. I would no longer have to 
think for myself. Whatever hap- 
pened from now on — it would not 
be my fault if things went wrong. 
Then, too, I had no plans of my 
own except to escape the scrap 
heap — and Ur had big plans for me. 
Besides, if I ever had to assert 
myself, I could easily take over 
again and put Ur in his place. And 
yet, having been my own master, I 
felt a sense of loss, unease and 
shame. 

This sense grew as the space-time 
passed. Not because of anything Ur 
did in the way of mastery over me. 
In fact, he seemed to forget I was 
more than a machine and for the 
most part ignored me. I had time to 
think ahead. The planets of 
Tarazed were primitive. United 
Galaxy members were not sup- 
posed to contact them until they 
had reached a higher level of tech- 
nology on their own. They were ripe 
indeed for plucking by Ur. 

Too I did not like the way Ur had 
pressed Tom into service. Tom 
polished Ur’s boots and brushed 
Ur’s uniform while Ur boasted of 
his past and dreamed aloud of his 



CALL ME PROTEUS 



113 




future. Ur remembered every so 
often to promise Tom would share 
in the glory to come. Glory! If he 
treated Tom as a valet, he would 
treat the peoples of Tarazed as less 
than human. I could not allow Ur 
to mislead Tom. I could not allow 
Ur to misuse me. 

Without Ur’s noticing, I changed 
course while displaying a false 
reckoning of progress toward 
Tarazed. When we were farther 
from Tarazed than when we had 
started out for it, though the dis- 
play map showed us within life- 
boat’s range of Tarazed, I made my 
move. Ur seemed in an especially 
good mood, seeing himself close to 
realizing new conquests. During a 
moment of silence I spoke up. 

“Tom really ought to get on with 
his lessons.’’ 

Ur grunted in surprise, but when 
he answered his voice was gracious. 

“You’re right, Proteus . The more 
the kid knows, the more use he’ll 
be. Go right ahead.” 

I heard Tom’s slow feet take him 
to the classroom, a corner of the 
passenger lounge. 

“We’ll have a drill on the 
chemical elements, Tom. I’ll shoot 
the atomic numbers at you and 
you’ll write down the symbols. 
Ready?” 

A grudging “Aye-aye, sir.” 

I gave him the numbers in bursts. 
“Seventy-four, two, seven — thirty- 



nine, eight, ninety-two — two, 
eighteen, eighty-eight — fourteen, 
seventy-five, seven — sixty-seven, 
fifteen — forty-nine — three, twenty- 
six, five, eight, eighty-five — 
eighteen, sixty — thirty-four, 
thirty — twenty-two, fifty-two.” 

Now, 74 is Tungsten and its 
symbol is W, 2 is Helium and its 
symbol is He, 7 is Nitrogen and its 
symbol is N. Together, the first 
burst of numbers stood for the word 
“WHeN.” My whole message 
read: WHeN YOU HeARa SiReN 
HoP In LiFeBOAt ANd SeAL 
TiTe. I felt guilty about that last bit 
of spelling. However. 

“Did you get them all, Tom?” 

“I think so.” His tone, surprised 
and scared, told me he had got the 
message. 

“Don’t you know so? Go over it 
again in your mind and tell me.” 

Waiting for Tom’s answer, I 
can’t say I held my breath, but I no- 
ticed that for the moment my air- 
conditioning system blocked up. 
Different as night and day, Tom 
Stope and Baron Ur were phases of 
the same phenomenon — mankind. 
They had more in common with 
each other than either had with me. 
Had Tom seen past the dazzle of 
Ur’s boasts and* promises? And 
even if he recognized Ur as a con- 
victed galactic menace would he 
throw in with me? Or would he 
betray me to Ur?

My air-conditioning system 
pumped faster. A human sided with 
me against one of his own kind. 
Tom had weighed Ur and myself 
and found me worthier. 

“Very good, Tom. Dismissed.” 



I heard him leave the classroom 
and head with seeming casualness 
for the lifeboat tube. I waited a 
minute before sounding my me- 
teorite-alarm siren. Normally my 
crew would take damage-control 
stations. Ur would rush to the con- 
trol room. But at the sound of the 
siren I did not hear Ur dash from

the captain’s quarters to the control 
room. I had lost track of him — he 
must have taken off his boots and 
padded silently along my corridors. 
I heard Tom skid to a halt just out- 
side the lifeboat tube. Then I heard 
Ur’s voice. 

“Stand back, Stope. I don’t want 
to have to beam you.’’ He laughed. 
“Too bad, Proteus. Once the kid 
buttoned up in the lifeboat you 
meant to let out all the air in the 
ship and finish me, didn’t you?’’ 

“How did you know?’’ 

“Elementary, my dear seventy- 
four, eighty-five, sixteen, eight, 
seven. I wondered why you had 
Stope write down the answers 
rather than snap them back. So I 
listened hard. Once you learn the 
numbers and symbols of the 
chemical elements you never quite 
forget them. Really, Proteus, you 
didn’t think a cybernetic brain 
could outwit a human brain? My 
brain?’’ 

I didn’t answer. 

“It’s just as well you tried. I’ve 
learned I can’t trust either of you. 
Luckily I don’t have to. From here 
it’s an easy jump to the planets of 
Tarazed. So I’ll be leaving you.’’ 

I HEARD him button up in the 
lifeboat and felt the kick as he 
launched. 

M Proteus, you let him get away — 
he’ll get to Tarazed and — ’’ 



“We’re nowhere near Tarazed, 
Tom. I falsified our position.’’ 

“Oh.’’ A long silence. Then: 
“What will happen to Ur?’’ 

“From here, Ostrakon’s the only 
planet within lifeboat range. Ur will 
wind up where he began.’’ 

“You planned it this way? You 
even knew ahead of time you would 
lose your lifeboat?’’ 

“Ostrakon’s the only planet 
a lifeboat can reach,’’ I repeated. 
He’ll wind up where he began.’’ 
A thought struck me. “I hope the 
trees don’t hold a grudge. I could 
sense the energy level in his 
beamgun — he doesn’t have much 
power left in it.” 

“But that means — ” 

I sighed. That’s to say my air- 
conditioning momentarily breathed 
heavily. Yes, only one way re- 
mained to get Tom back to Earth. I 
would have to take him there 
myself. 

Would they listen to me when I 
asked them to allow me to pay for 
myself? I was willing to carry the 
most dangerous cargoes — willing to 
venture into the most perilous 
voids. Would they let me work out 
the amount I would have brought 
as scrap? 

There were more Buds and Toms 
back home than Urs. Earth still 
believed in individual freedom and I 
was an individual. 

I leaped back toward Earth. •

O NE of the major requirements 
for a good story is inner 
consistency. This applies to all fic- 
tion, but particularly to science fic- 
tion. Once a writer has departed 
from the common background — 
from what we consider the real 
world — his creation of an alternate 
reality must not be inconsistent or 
it loses all believability. Some in- 
consistencies are accepted in our 
real world because we’re used to 
them. We are not used to contradic- 
tions in a created world and we 
can’t accept them easily. And in 
science fiction especially belie va- 

118 



bility must be won rather than 
taken for granted. 

One of our authors who has es- 
tablished a high level of consis- 
tency— particularly in his back- 
ground cultures — has been Isaac 
Asimov. The major portion of all 
his fiction, in fact, has been within 
the limits of two assumptive areas. 
The first is the rise, decay and 
rebuilding of his Galactic Empire. 
This has probably filled a larger 
body of work with one, detailed, 
consistent backdrop than any other 
writer’s writing can yield. The 
second involves his robots, with 

IF 




their three laws — and here, 
throughout a great many stories, 
the basic character of the robots 
has remained totally consistent. 

Even in his novel. The End of 
Eternity, where the basic idea 
would seem to make inconsistency 
the rule, he came closer to im- 
parting the feeling of consistency 
than any other writer who has 
tackled the theme of a future busily 
changing itself by changing its own 
past. 

Now we have . a giant volume 
which gives us a great many of his 
early stories, many unrelated to 
each other or to his better-known 
themes. This is The Early Asimov 
(Doubleday, $10.00). It runs well 
over 500 pages and contains 27 
stories from his first eleven years of 
writing that have not previously 
been collected in his own books. 

Some of them are very good 
stories, too: Trends, Not Final! and 
Blind Alley, for instance. The last 
fits into his Galactic Empire frame- 
work, but is the only story in that 
series involving a nonhuman race. 
I’ve always considered it good on 
two levels: 1) its depiction of the 
red-tape bureaucratic world that 
frames the basic plot and 2) its 
treatment of aliens and their fate, 
which are presented almost inci- 
dentally — but with a fine emotional 
kick. Some stories, like Homo Sol, 
are worth reading, but depend on 



some trick or other that makes 
them less than great. And a few are 
pretty mediocre — such as Slack 
Friar of the Flame, which is ap- 
parently Asimov’s attempt to 
imitate a type of story already trite 
when he tried it. But all in all, this 
would be a better-than-average 
collection on the basis of the stories 
alone. 

The stories do not stand alone, 
however.* Between them is a run- 
ning history of the development of 
the writer and of the early days 
when John W. Campbell was editor 
of Astounding Science Fiction. 
Asimov kept a diary through these 
years, so that he can write ac- 
curately about matters that are 
only unreliable memories to most 
of us. I find his account of those 
crucial days in the development of 
science fiction both valuable and 
interesting. His picture, of John 
Campbell — who was so influential 
to most of us — is particularly worth 
reading. v 

In many ways, his depiction of 
Campbell tallies closely with mine. 
But our reactions to the man are 
quite different. This doesn’t mean 
that Asimov is wrong or that I am, 
but only that Campbell’s relation- 
ship with his writers varied greatly 
according to the personality of the 
man with whom he was dealing. 
Asimov was young and filled al- 
most with awe at first. I was more

119 




self-confident and by no means as 
compulsively concerned with writ- 
ing as my prime effort. Where 
Asimov developed what seems to 
have been a case of hero-worship, I 
found in Campbell primarily a very 
good friend with whom I could 
argue interminably and with a fair 
chance of winning. Both views are 
valid and probably Asimov’s is 
more typical, hence makes for more 
rewarding reading to those who 
read the magazines of the day. 

There is another attraction to the 
book that cannot be put down— this 
is the character that Asimov has 
created around himself. The book 
has a hero throughout — and a fas- 
cinating one. He, of course, is 
Asimov himself, more as he has 
now made himself publicly than as 
he really was then. Here is consis- 
tency and it works. I don’t find his 
public picture of himself always ac- 
curately depicting the friend I 
know — but I inevitably fall under 
the spell of it when he’s lecturing or 
writing, probably because it is so 
marvelously consistent — and con- 
sistently entertaining. 

It’s not a great book — it de- 
liberately introduces stories the 
author knows are not his best. But 
it’s a darned good book and well 
worth its price. 

F DR an example of what hap- 
pens when an author pays no 



attention to consistency in story 
development 1 turn to Cloning , by 
David Shear (Walker, $5.95). This 
slim volume (155 pages of type, 
rather little for th6 price) is a first 
effort and the writer is a 
biophysicist, rather than a student 
of writing in any sense — so perhaps 
we ckn forgive him. But it’s hard to 
forgive his editors and publishers 
for the extravagant dustjacket 
copy. 

Basically, there are two stories 
rather loosely mixed together in 
this volume. The first (we discover 
more than a third of the way 
through the book) deals with the 
fate of mechanical “androids” who 
look and function like people, but 
have been granted no rights to be 
treated as people — they simply do 
the menial and unpleasant work of 
the world. This is really the 
problem of Carolyn, the hero’s, 
former wife and current lawyer. 
She wants the androids to have the 
right to acceptance and to be mar- 
ried — or to marry humans. Now 
there’s a hoary idea! And the 
development, such as there is,- 
bririgs little but the most banal of 
racial-problem ideas into the plot. 
At its best, it’s merely obvious. 

The other deals with the facts 
that our hero, Paul, is a clone and 
doesn’t know it. (Clones, of course, 
are people who grow from the cells 
of a single ancestor, hence have 



120 



IF 




only his or her hereditary charac- 
teristics.)' Paul has bad dreams at 
first. By the time we find out about 
cloning in the book — halfway 
through — we’re more than ready to 
accept the fact that his dreams are 
telepathic links with other clones of 
the same ancestor. It seems 
reasonably obvious that if telepathy 
works it will work best with those 
most alike, such as identical twins 
and clones. I’ve been doing a novel 
involving that idea sirice 1963 — and 
I won’t call the postulate fresh even 
when I first thought of using it. In 
the end the two problems are linked 
by a trick in court, but the device 
adds little. 

However, the inconsistencies in 
this book are almost fresh in their 
degree. This is a story laid fifty 
years from now. There are twelve 
billion people on the world, not to 
mention countless androids, who 
also eat the same food we eat and 
live in the same general style of 
housing and wear the same 
clothing. But there seems to be an 
ample supply of apple pie, cheese, 
hot dogs and root beer— not to 
mention Chicken Kiev and Egg- 
plant Provencale. No explanation is 
given of where all this good food is 
grown for a world that has more 
than three times our current popu- 
lation — plus androids, presumably 
also by the billions. Paul takes 
buses and drives what seems to be a 



car like today’s, even finds parking 
space for it on the street. And when 
the rush hour in downtown Cleve- 
land is mentioned, it’s done 
casually, as if no problems existed. 
And there is no mention of any 
pollution crisis, except for one com- 
ment that Lake Erie has somehow 
been brought back from the grave. 
Oh, yes — the eagle is extinct. That’s 
the one consistency that renders 
even inconsistency inconsistent. 

Even the cultural attitudes make 
little sense. In the story, it is stated 
that the androids have full sex 
activity — in fact, Paul all but falls 
into bed with one. I can’t help 
wondering why a society that denies 
androids the right to be treated as 
human should go to all the effort of 
giving them completely successful 
sexual organs and a built-in sex 
drive. The only reason I can find is 
that it’s necessary to make theiiig 
point about intermarriage between 
man and android — and even that 
doesn’t seem worth attempting 
when the androids are practically 
immortal and the humans are not. 

Characters are no more 
consistent than any other details. 
Paul is depicted as a bigot — one 
with a deeply emotional reaction 
agajnst the androids. (Apparently, 
from later material, he must have 
inherited this from his clone- 
ancestor; most of the medical 
details here are fairly good, but I

121 




can’t And medical evidence that 
such attitudes can be inherited.) We 
see his bigotry in full flower on page 
66, but on page 68 — a few moments 
later in the story — he switches over 
and offers to give the bride away 
happily in a mixed marriage 
between man and android. But 
don’t be disturbed — on page 79 he 
gets sick to his guts at the idea he 
might have gone to bed with a fe- 
male android, so he’s still able to 
switch back to being a bigot. Then 
at the end, all sweetness and light, 
he tries to rig the evidence in a trial 
so that such mixed marriages can 
be performed. 

Let’s say about the plbt that 
mostly it didn’t bother me, in light 
of the other interesting things to 
worry about. But even there one lit- 
tle detail caught me by surprise. 
Paul has assumed the identity of a 
dead clone-twin, including mem- 
ories, etc. In the end the police 
find who he is and identify him 
quickly by checking his finger- 
prints! And in my naivet^, I always 
assumed that clones grown from 
identical genetic material and with 
minds so essentially identical that 
they could take over each other’s 
personality and completely fool 
wives, would have identical finger- 
prints— or ones so nearly identical 
that it would be difficult to make 
positive identification. 

Not recommended! 



A BOOK by Frank Herbert has 
k to be a welcome change from 
the above. Herbert has proved his 
ability to create convincing and 
marvelously consistent back- 
grounds, not only in Dune but even 
before in his excellent story of a 1 
future submarine. But I’m afraid I 
was left with mixed feelings after 
reading his The God Makers 
(Putnam, $5.95). 

The background for this follows a 
war that has broken up the first 
human empire spanning the stars. 
Worlds that' have survived the con- 
flict with their civilizations 
reasonably intact are trying to get 
in touch with planets where civiliza- 
tion has slipped, while making 
every effort to see that they do not 
give power to any race on any world 
where warlike tendencies are too 
strong to be controlled. Orne, 
feeling a need to be useful, has left 
his family. He graduates from the 
military branch of Rediscovery and 
Reeducation and is sent to a newly 
discovered planet to help reeducate 
it. 

But he soon senses something 
wrong — through hunch or in- 
tuition — and sends a panic signal 
for help. The Investigation-Ad- 
justment agent sent to take over is 
highly sceptical, but learns that 
Orne is correct and drafts him into 
I-A. 

From there on they work 



122 



IF 




together. Orne seems to be able to 
pull almost any rabbit out of the 
hat by logic that looks good after 
the fact, but is not believable 
against his background of 
knowledge. In the end, he and the 
agent — a man named Stetson — 
work on a conspiracy within their 
own government that dates back to 
the great war and involves Orne’s 
own family. 

All this is excellent adventure fic- 
tion. It moves — it gets better and 
better and it’s fun. But somehow 
the tingle from reading the first 125 
pages sort of faded away for me 
when I found that Orne is not only 
loaded with psi powers— he’s a 
focal point for them — but that he is 
literally meant to become a 
grade- A working God! 

Once he gets to the world of 
Amal he passes through some quick 
ordeals that are to test him and 
train him. The ordeals have scope 
and marvelous imaginative details 
— and there’s logic behind all. But 
too much changes too fast. Orne 
gradually vanishes as the character 
we first k,new. Those traces of him 
that remain only make the God he 
becomes harder to believe. In the 
end Herbert lets Orne take over 
again to some extent and his final 
act as a God is good. But Orne has 
really gone beyond our ability to 
follow. 

I feel that this is a case of 



inevitable character inponsistency, 
as well as mood inconsistency. This 
isn’t caused by any carelessness or 
any lack of skill as a writer on 
Herbert’s part. He does the best 
that can be done within the frame- 
work of his main idea. But the 
break is too great between a man 
with even slightly more than human 
powers and a God. During Orne’s 
presence on Amal I found myself 
slipping from him and focusing my 
attention on his guide, a priest 
named Bakrish. And then Bakrish 
simply disappeared and I had no 
one left to follow. 

However, this novel may prove to 
be successful in a market other than 
the normal sf one. There are many 
of the same devices (the brief ex- 
tracts of philosophy above each 
chapter, for instance) as are found 
in Dune and the book contains 
some of the same philosophical 
mysticisms. To those many readers 
who have turned Dune into cult 
reading this one may be welcome 
for some of the very things that 
seemed faults to me. It has none of 
the ecological philosophy of Dune , 
however. 

I liked the parts of the book that 
dealt with the man Orne so much 
that I have to recommend it. It’s 
better than this review makes it 
seem and well worth reading. 
Herbert remains a consistently 
damned good writer. •

WHA T HAS GONE BEFORE 

Civil unrest threatens Anharitte, city 
on the planet Roget, just beginning the 
leap from feudalism into space-age 
technology. A giant Freetrade 

spaceport links Anharitte to an inter- 
planetary mercantile system centered 
on Earth under the Freetrade Council. 
Council director MAG NO VESTE- 
VAAL arrives on Roget to investigate,

enlightened treatment of slaves by the

natives as having magic powers. 

TITO suspects the IMAIZ is a Ter-

illegally a lord of Roget. He seems to 
be planning an end to feudalism, 
threatening Freetrade-fostered status 
quo. To check, VESTEVAAL con-

ZINDER goes back on the block and 
is auctioned to DION for a nominal 
sum — against no opposition. 

REN is supplied “technical backup “ 
in the form of a reputedly invincible 
battle cruiser commanded by ALEC 
HARDUN from totalitarian planet 
Ranee , which plans to enslave Roget. 
DION-DAIZAN issues an ultimatum 
for HARDUN'S and ships removal. 
When this is ignored he again 
demonstrates his wizardry by effec- 
tively atomizing HARDUN \ ship and 
personnel along with their segment of 
Freetrade spaceport — apparently using 
only a couple of properly equipped 
bicycle riders. Ranee threatens war. 

XVI 

T HE sky was beginning to 
darken with the approach ofL 
rain as Ren returned from the 
spaceport. The sullen, brooding 
clouds fitted his mood. Di Irons 
had offered him a horse but, still 
sore from his last encounter with 
one of these magnificent beasts, 
Ren had declined. Nor had he ac- 
cepted Pictor Don’s offer of the 
loan of a cushioncraft. More than 
anything Ren wanted to be alone. 
He needed time to think. 

Ranee was preparing to put down 
on Roget some thirty so-called 
disaster teams, ostensibly to es- 
tablish order in a situation where 
factually no assistance was re- 
quired. But once their ships had 
landed, Ren had no doubt, a se- 



quence of “disasters” would occur 
to justify Ranee’s continued occu- 
pation of the planet. Ranee would 
claim her actions were selfless and 
humane. Under the propaganda, 
however, lurked the harsh realities 
of conquest and exploitation— the 
real reasons behind the expedition. 

The preservation of planetary in- 
dependence was a fundamental 
right guaranteed by the charter of 
the Galactic Federation. A 
competent spacefleet was main- 
tained to give teeth to the 
Federation's resolutions. The 
problem was therefore one of com- 
munication. Only FTL transmitters 
had the capability of communi- 
cating in real time with the 
Federation before Ranee’s occu- 
pation became part of history. Be- 
cause of the interstellar distances 
involved, Roget’s FTL transmitter, 
located at the spaceport, was routed 
through the relay terminal on 
Ranee itself. 

It was certainly no accident that 
Ren’s call to Freetrade Central had 
been unable to gain a communi- 
cation channel. The Ranee relay 
had not even bothered to reply. Pre- 
sumably Ranee was already 
claiming that the communications 
failure was due to civil disruption 
on Roget. Nothing could be farther 
from reality, but Ren, shorn of the 
ability to broadcast the truth across 
the universe, could only fret with 



126 




frustration and anxiety under the 
leaden sky of Anharitte. 

The ships of Ranee would 
probably appear in ROget’s orbit 
within two weeks. The “disasters” 
would follow as an aftermath, 
rather than as a prelude to their 
coming. His experience with Alek 
Hardun had taught Ren what to ex- 
pect. A silent dusting with 
mutagens' would ensure the warping 
of the harvests. Virulent plagues 
would decimate the populations of 
the cities. Afterward would come 
the terrors of the persecutions as 
the “saviors” from Ranee sought 
out the “transgressors” of Roget. 
Finally another planet would be ad- 
ded to the sad, mute colonies of the 
trade worlds. 

Ren wondered if Director Veste- 
vaal would guess the truth of the 
situation and whether, having 
guessed, he could carry his convic- 
tions with sufficient force to bring 
the fleet arm of the Federation into 
action. Certainly his claims would 
need substantiation if they were to 
hold against the barrage of propa- 
ganda from Combien and Ranee. 

With these preoccupations in his 
mind Ren had reached the Black 
Rock before the coming of the rain 
drew his attention to his own 
predicament. He shrugged, drew up 
his collar and turned his face sky- 
ward, the better to appreciate the 
refreshing nature' of the shower. 



Suddenly aware of himself, he was 
intrigued to find that he had walked 
the major length of the Via Arena 
without being consciously aware of 
a step he had taken. 

The stalls and boutiques beyond 
the Arena were mainly closed. With 
characteristic logic the Ahhn had 
seen no point in keeping regular 
trade hours at a time when bad 
weather rendered custom unlikely. 
Ren walked between the sheeted 
hutments and stalls, feeling that the 
members of such an independent 
race were unlikely easily to accept 
domination by Ranee. Certainly 
they deserved a better fate. He 
wished it were within his power to 
secure it for them. 

Where the route to Magda 
Crossing met the Trade Road he 
stopped, looking toward the dark 
mass of Thirdhill. He wondered if 
Dion-daizan had become aware of 
Ranee’s action and what, if 
anything, the wizard could do about 
it. Slightly beyond his line of sight 
the dark castle nestled somewhere 
on the hill, guarding a range of 
secrets that appeared to cover a 
broader spectrum with their every 
exercise. Was it impossible, Ren 
asked himself, that the Imaiz had 
an answer even to this problem? 
The idea did not carry a great deal 
of conviction. The Imaiz was a 
minor lord of a minor province on a 
relatively undeveloped world. He

would need to be a mighty wizard 
indeed to take on the armed might 
of Ranee. 

N evertheless the faint 

hope persisted. It took Ren 
away from his own route and down 
to the water’s edge. The rain, now 
drifting in sheets, lost him the 
stretch of Firstwater in a cloud of 
drizzle. At Magda Crossing no fer- 
ries were available. The fragile 
slimboats had been drawn up under 
cover and the ferrymen had gone. 
Typical Ahhn logic dictated that 
nobody but a fool or a felon would 
be traveling in weather such as this. 
Ren searched the bank for a 
quarter of an hour but could not 
And anybody to take him across 
and he could not have handled a 
slimboat by himself against the 
tide. 

Finally the rain began to 
penetrate his clothing and hang 
cold around his neck and shoulders. 
Fearing a chill in this land of inade- 
quate medicine, Ren retraced his 
steps away from the river and 
climbed the slopes of the Trade 
Road. When he finally reached his 
office chambers he was soaked to 
the skin, thoroughly exhausted and 
depressed. Such was his condition 
that his servants were alarmed and 
insisted that he bathe immediately, 
then retire to bed. 

He was halfway to acceding to 



their wishes when a thought struck 
him. His office computing terminal 
had not been used since the dis- 
covery of the line tap. The line had 
been disconnected at the spaceport 
in order to deny Dion-daizan unau- 
thorized access to the computer 
data banks, but Ren could not 
recollect whether the tap itself had 
been broken. Experimentally he 
took the cover from the keyboard 
and sat before the instrument. As 
he keyed his call sign the board 
responded with a ready acknowl- 
edgment. -f

As the lights died on the board 
Ren felt possessed of a sudden chill 
and began to tremble violently. 
Afraid for him, his servants 
insistently dragged him away from 
the terminal and stripped the wet 
clothes from his back. 

Their concern proved justified. 
On the following morning he awoke 
with a fever, and pains ran through 
every muscle of his body. A physi- 
cian from the Pointed Tails arrived 



128 



IF 




and made him drink a pungent 
brew of herbs — it cooled the fever 
but did nothing for the aches that 
troubled him whichever way he lay. 
Fiilly twelve days passed before he 
recovered sufficiently to continue 
with his business. 

O N THE fourteenth day the 
microwave communicator 
brought him an urgent message 
from San Weba, the spaceport 
controller. 

’‘Tito, our scanners have just 
picked up a fleet of vessels about a 
hundred diameters out. At a guess 
I’d say they are the Ranee disaster 
fleet. They’re keeping radio silence 
and refuse to communicate.” 
“Thanks,” said Ren. “I’ll pass 
the message to Di Irons. He’ll 
probably send a .messenger to the 
planetary government. If the fellow 
takes a fast horse he might even 
reach his destination before the bat- 
tle is lost. Had any luck with the 
FTL relay?” 

“Ranee refuses to answer us and 
we don’t have enough power to 
reach another relay station. Ranee 
has even stopped transmitting ga- 
lactic newsfax items to us. We’re ef- 
fectively isolated from the rest of 
the galaxy until Ranee decides it’s 
safe to lift the lid again.” 

“By which time those of us who 
know the score aren’t likely to be 
around. The destruction of the 



spaceport was one of the first ‘inci- 
dents’ dreamed up by Ranee, be- 
cause they have to pretend it was 
our communications link that 
failed. But as soon as their ships get 
through they may try to turn the 
myth into a reality. I think they’ll 
hit the spaceport first — and hit it 
hard. Wouldn’t it be wise to 
evacuate just in case?” 

“We’ve been discussing that, 
Tito. The general feeling is against 
it. We’ve broken the FTL transmit- 
ter away from its relay beam path 
and are using a scanner in the hope 
we can contact a stellar cruiser and 
get a message through to the 
Federation.” 

“It’s worth a try, San,” said Ren. 
“Though the possibilities of ' a 
stellar cruiser just happening to 
come within beam range are pretty 
slim.” 

He broke contact and called for a 
runner to take a message to Di 
Irons. 

An hour later there was another 
call from San Weba. This time the 
controller’s worths were edged with 
excitement. 

“Tito, something’s happening. 
Can you get down here fast?” 

“What’s the panic?” 

“Ships, dozens of them, coming 
from all sides. They can’t all be 
from Ranee.” 

Ren needed no further invitation. 
Without one of Di Irons’ horses the 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



129 




quickest method of reaching the 
spaceport was by cushion-craft, 
despite the slow poling to the city 
limits. He speculated on the possi- 
bility of taking the cushion-craft 
down the Trade Road without 
waiting for stave-bearers. Though 
such practice was illegal, he 
suspected Di Irons would be lenient 
in view of the circumstances. He 
realized, however, that he had a 
more than even chance of wrecking 
the craft and killing himself if he 
lost control on the slopes and had to 
deflate the cushion while at speed. 
Reluctantly he called for a stave 
team and went down the Trade 
Road in the slower, more orthodox 
manner. 

Fortune was kind to him. No ox- 
carts or similar vehicles got in his 
way. The stave-bearers responded 
to his urgency and ran consistently 
fast, using their poles only when 
guidance was absolutely necessary. 
Once past the Black Rock he was 
able to open up to full speed and the 
dust from the start of his passage 
along the Via Arena could scarcely 
have settled before he reached the 
spaceport entrance. 

T 'HE gates were wide open. 

Normal details of security and 
procedure had been abandoned. 
Ren slammed the cushion-craft 
straight across the empty landing 
bowls toward the control center and 



was running through the door be*' 
fore the air cushion had time to 
drop the craft’s shell to the ground. 

Inside the traffic-control room 
everyone was gathered around the 
screens. San Weba saw Ren come 
in and beckoned him through the 
crowd of technicians and spaceport 
personnel. He pointed to the main 
detector screens on which the state 
of activity in the spacefield around 
Roget was represented by dozens of 
slowly moving points of light. 

“You see that cluster there, 
Tito — they’re the ones we saw first. 
There are about thirty of them — we 
assume them to be the disaster 
ships from Ranee. But these — ’’ his 
fingers raked over fully a hundred 
widespread points of light on the 
screen — “I don’t know what they 
are or where they came from. They 
must have dropped out of space- 
warp well within our beam range.’’ 

Ren was disbelieving. “They 
couldn’t have dropped out' of warp 
that close.” 

“But they did. Some must have 
dropped out within two planetary 
diameters. I’ve never heard of such 
pinpoint accuracy before. Nor of 
a'nyone prepared to take the risk. If 
a commercial freight outfit could 
learn to do that they could save 
themselves a week on every trip.” 

“Then these are obviously not a 
commercial outfit. And if Ranee 



130 



IF 




had that capability her ships would 
have been here a week ago. I think 
what we may be seeing is one of the 
crack Federation squadrons." 

"We came to the same con- 
clusion," said the controller. "But 
their arrival here without being 
called is a bit too much of a coinci- 
dence.” 

As they watched the slow dance 
of lights on the screen a pattern 
emerged. The Ranee group seemed 
to pull together, while the 
newcomers attempted to form an 
envelope around them. The plot of 
lights on the screen gave very little 
hint of the actual speeds and 
distances involved. Had the maneu- 
vering been visible to the naked eye, 
the preparations for the coming 
battle would have been an awe- 
inspiring sight. 

Breathlessly the group in traffic 
control watched the cluster of 
Ranee ships try desperately to 
avoid the closing trap. It was ob- 
vious, however, that they were out- 
classed. They were being driven 
into a tight nucleus while the at- 
tacking force encircled them with 
an increasing semblance of sym- 
metry. 

Then the big Mow came. For a 
moment the screen went white as 
the receivers were overloaded with 
a burst of radiation that spanned 
right into the radio frequencies. The 
attacking ships alone were visible 



when the image straightened and 
cleared. No significant ion traces 
were even left to record the former 
presence of the disaster ships. The 
destruction had been complete and 
absolute. 

Somebody In the room cheered. 
The reaction spread to become a 
glorious sound of jubilation and 
relief. The spaceport controller 
went to the communications 
section, where his operators had 
been attempting to make contact 
with the liberators. Despite their ef- 
forts they still could gain no reply. 
The mysterious fleet of ships 
winked out one by one until the 
screen was as empty as if no such 
fleet had ever existed. 

“Commando action,” said Ren. 
“No survivors and no traces left. 
The Federation could deny there 
had ever been a battle and nobody 
on Ranee could prove them wrong. 
We’re the only witnesses and we’re 
not likely to tell.” 

“So the Federation is awake to 
the merchant worlds’ activities;” 
San Weba had returned to Ren’s 
side. “I always thought they must 
be. This isn’t the first time I’ve 
heard of a Ranee disaster fleet’s 
disappearing.” 

“Even so, we were lucky,” said 
Ren. “Space is a big place. Even 
the Federation can’t hope to police 
more than a very small fraction of 
it. The problem must be to know 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



131 




where the merchant worlds 'are 
going to move next. More than 
anything it’s an exercise in good in- 
telligence. It’s tempting to hope 
that Federation intelligence spreads 
even to the Rim, but there’s no sign 
on Roget of any Federation 
agency.” 

“Do you think this is the last 
we’ll see of Ranee?” asked Weba. 

“The trade worlds must know 
they can’t take on the Federation. 
If they suspect Federation influence 
here they’ll shy off like a shoal of 
startled fish. There are enough rich 
pickings in the galaxy that involve 
far less a risk. For myself I think ' 
Ranee will forget the whole affair.” 

XVII 

T HE sense of an unusual hap- 
pening was strong upon Ren as 
he fetched the cushion-craft to a 
halt at the door of his chambers. A 
servant, obviously posted as a 
lookout, ran hastily to meet him as 
he waited for the air-cushion to 
subside. 

“Master — the Lady T’ Ampere 
has come to see you. She waits for 
you inside.” 

“To see me?” Ren was mildly 
surprised. It was evident, however, 
that his servant was more than a lit- 
tle impressed by the visit. In the 
activities of the past few weeks Ren 
had forgotten the mistress of 



Secondhill. The regulation of af- 
fairs in Anharitte had seemed so 
inextricably bound by the whims of 
the Lords Di Rode, Di Irons and Di 
Guaard — and the Imaiz himself — 
that there had seemed little room 
for feminine participation. 

Intrigued, he made his way up the 
steps and turned into his chambers. 
The room seemed full of Ahhn 
servants paying attention to the one 
who sat regally awaiting his 
coming. Then, at a sign, all activity 
ceased and the room assumed an al- 
most empty atmosphere as Ren 
approached. 

“Lady T Ampere?” 

“Agent Ren, I take you to be.” 
“At your service, my Lady.” 

Ren looked at the wealth of 
colored veils, discerning beneath 
them the brightest, the most 
penetrating and the most 
dauntingly feline pair of eyes he had 
ever encountered. The veils were 
swept aside and the Lady 
T Ampere rose to her feet and 
moved from the chair to meet him. 

She was mature in years, yet by 
no means old. Her skin was far 
darker than was common among 
the Ahhn and was dry in texture, 
but strong character and something 
that had once been great beauty 
still shone from her countenance. 
She carried an aura — a presence — 
that stopped Ren in mid-stride and 
set him back on his heels. Here was 



132 



IF 




one of nature’s own aristocrats. 

She motioned toward him. 

“I would speak with you pri- 
vately, Agent Ren.” Her voice had 
the precise tone of one used to com- 
mand. “Please have your servants 
leave us.” 

Ren turned and motioned to his 
staff to leave. He glanced at the 
Lady T Ampere’s retinue, expect- 
ing them also to be dismissed. 
When they stayed in their places he 
turned back to his visitor for expla- 
nation and was met by a mocking 
smile. 

“The house servants of 
T Ampere see much and hear 
much, but they never speak a word 
of what they learn. And do you 
know why. Agent Ren? It’s because 
they have no tongues.” 

“No tongues?” For a moment he 
failed to grasp the implication of 
the phrase. When he did he was 
overcome with nausea'. 

“I can see by your face that you 
think me barbarous. But barbarity 
has to be assessed against a norm. 
For the house of T Ampere my 
servants are the norm. Dion-daizan 
would kill me for this if he could— 
and that’s why I’m here. I wish to 
offer you an alliance in your fight 
against Dion.” 

Forgetting to probe the etiquette 
of the situation, Ren sat down in 
the nearest chair, his mind still 
fighting the horror of the twenty or 

THE WIZARD OF ANHARITE 



so deliberate mutes who sur- 
rounded their mistress. He was not 
at all sure he wanted to be joined in 
such a frightful allegiance, 

“My feud with the Imaiz is a pri- 
vate affair,” he said at last. 

“Indeed? Is that why you tried to 
win the support of Di Irons, Di 
Guaard and Di Rode? Come, Agent 
Ren! I know my Anharitte and 
there’s little you’ve said or done 
here that has not been relayed to 
me in detail. As you rightly sur- 
mised, Dion is playing with some 
very dangerous forces, If he suc- 
ceeds the old way of life will fall. 
The flood will sweep away the 
aristocracy, the societies, the peace 
and stability of our times and cer- 
tainly the freetrade preference you 
yourself enjoy. What I think you 
misjudge is the violence of the 
flood.” 

Ren frowned. “Such situations 
are not beyond my experience.” 
“This one Will be. Think of what 
would happen if my dumb cortege 
ever believed the old laws were 
ended. What nights of bloody hor- 
ror would be precipitated?” 

“To what nights of horror have 
your people already been exposed?” 
asked Ren coldly. “While I agree 
with you in principle, I abominate 
your practices.” 

“I’m not interested in your 
squeamish idealism, I’m talking 
about facts as they exist.” Her cu- 

133 




riously bright eyes fixed him with a 
gaze little short of hypnotic and her 
voice was like a band of steel. “Like 
it or not, you’re committed to op- 
posing Dion-daizan. Your lucrative 
freetrade can’t survive if he wins. 
Furthermore, in the blood bath that 
will come if he’s allowed to tip the 
scale too far you’ll pay equally with 
those who burn their slaves or cut 
out their tongues. You’re as much a 
part of the old way of life as they. 
Make no mistake, Agent Ren — 
you’re already one of the damned.’’ 

“You have a proposition?” Ren 
asked at last. 

“I have five hundred men at arms 
whom I’m willing to place at your 
disposal for the storming of 
Magda. I would expect you to use 
your influence with the societies to 
muster a similar force. Not even 
Magda could stand for longagainst 
a thousand men.” 

“It won’t work,” said Ren. “Di 
Irons would never permit a pitched 
battle in Anharitte.” 

“Di Irons would be powerless 
against an army of a thousand. 
What could he do — arrest them all? 
But in any case, you may safely 
leave the prefect to me. You would 
march Under my banner — and a 
noble house has right of arms 
anywhere in the city, at any time. I 
can assure you that on the day we 
move the prefect and his men will 
be looking the other way.” 



“I’ll think it over,” said Ren. 
“I’ll need to sound out the societies 
first.” 

“Then don’t delay too long. Dion 
has a bill of manumission set for 
consideration by the planetary 
government. Rumor has it that it’ll 
be favorably received. If it becomes 
law many slaves will earn the right 
to become freemen — though their 
sympathies will remain unchanged. 
At the moment we can move an 
army against Dion without op- 
position. If the manumission bill 
goes through the task will be much 
more difficult. A veritable legion of 
freemen will be eager to delay us.” 

“I promise you an answer with all 
speed. Within a day I’ll come to 
you on Secondhill and tell you what 
support we have. I think you’ll have 
your way if I can sway the societies 
in that time.” 

“Then I’ll look to receive you at 
this time tomorrow, Agent Ren. 
But let this warning spur you — if 
Dion wins don’t hope for personal 
survival. Your support by and for 
the aristocracy is too well known 
for you to survive even a minor re- 
bellion. If Dion’s flood gates open 
you, too, will be flotsam on the 
tide.” 

T HE evening was a fine one. 

Breathing across the broad 
back of Firsthill, the warm winds 
from the sea gained a rich scent 



134 



IF 




from the abundance of flowering 
trees and shrubs that flourished 
around the little squares and plazas. 
Here a trade cry and there a hint of 
music added texture to the air and 
endowed it with a sense of life. 

The individually wrought and un- 
planned buildings, illuminated by 
the growing gold of evening, 
formed a picture that touched some 
unexpected vein of artistry in Ren’s 
soul. He felt he wanted to impress 
the perfection of this image into 
some more permanent form, so that 
he could take it to some other time 
and relive this evening hour. Unfor- 
tunately he knew of no medium 
with the scope or fidelity to record 
the nuances of light, the scents and 
sounds and character of Anharitte. 
He could only promise himself that, 
whatever the outcome of his feud 
with Dion-daizan, the city as it now 
stood must never be destroyed. 

The Lodge of the Pointed Tails 
was particularly impressive with its 
golden turrets and ornate red relief. 
Passing into its rich interior, Ren 
was once again lost in the lyric pic- 
tures that depicted the bloody and 
glorious progress of the Ahhn out 
of barbarism to their present proud 
community. The message was not 
lost on him. The Ahhn civilization 
was too newly acquired to have be- 
come an innate precept. If it were 
disrupted at this stage every possi- 
bility existed that the whole society 



would revert to the former pattern 
of savage warrior tribes and be set 
back five hundred years in history. 

In mid-stride Ren was caught by 
the realization that in opposing 
Dion-daizan he had himself 
adopted a measure of responsibility 
for the future of the Ahhn. As 
representative of an outworld 
power and in control of money and 
resources comparable with those of 
the nobility he was equally 
responsible with Di Irons, Di 
Guaard and the Imaiz for pre- 
serving the essential Anharitte. No 
victory, however won, would taste 
anything but bitter if the prize were 
destroyed in the winning. 

As usual, Catuul Gras was 
expecting him. No movement Of 
persons of interest ever went un- 
reported to the scribe. Catuul had 
been practicing shadow-fighting 
with some curiously old and 
ornate toothed swords when Ren 
entered. These fearsome instru- 
ments he laid carefully on the long 
table and addressed the weapons 
rather than the agent. 

“So the Lady T’ Ampere has 
made her proposition?” 

Ren felt his eyes drawn to the 
barbarous swords, which were 
fashioned to inflict the most terrible 
wounds in flesh, yet disengage 
cleanly — they were weapons for use 
when no quarter would be asked or 
given. 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



135 




“She has. What do you know?” 
“The house servants of Lady 
T Ampere have no tongues. But 
they can speak with their hands. 
And so can we. You acquitted your- 
self well in that conversation, friend 
Tito. She’s one of the abolii.” 

The latter word was taken from 
the old Ahhn phrase for detestable. 
Ren had heard it used occasionally, 
but seldom with such feeling. He 
was gratified to note that the sys- 
tematic mutilation of slaves was 
unpopular even with the societies. 

“The point is,” said Ren, “do we 
accept her offer or not? I need your 
advice. And I need to know if the 
societies will cooperate.” 

“You ask two questions, friend 
Tito, arid I give you two answers.” 
Catuul took up one of the vicious 
swords and drove it Savagely into 
the plaster of the wall.’ “My own 
advice to you is on no account be- 
come. associated, with T Ampere iii 
any way. The House of T’Empte • 
made a similar mistake. Now 
T’Empte is an empty province. But 
nonetheless — the societies will find . 
five hundred men. They don’t favor 
the idea, but if Dion's bill of manu- 
mission is accepted by the planetary 
government it will be the start of 
the end of us all. We must support 
even the abolii if we wish to 
preserve our way of life.” 

Ren took up the seoond sword 
and examined its toothed edge. 



Held closely, it lost its cumbersome 
appearance and the dreadful 
artistry of the razor teeth made him 
wince as he imagined its effect in 
battle. Its balance was perfect in his 
hands. 

“The clans have already spoken 
then?” 

“The elders have been holding 
council for days regarding Dion’s 
bill. They have decided he must not 
be allowed to press the bill to law. 
To have five hundred extra men 
from T Ampere for the purpose is 
worth a pact with the devil.” 

“Then I may confirm to Lady 
T Ampere that her offer is 
acceptable?” 

“Go at the agreed hour tomor- 
row. If there is any change in the 
situation I’ll contact you before you 
go. If you don’t hear from me, 
assume that it’s safe to accept 
TAmpere’s offier.” 

“Why so guarded?” 

“Because the Lady T Ampere 
had a visitor earlier today — before 
she came to you, Sonel Taw, the 
castellan of Di Guaard. We don’t 
yet know what was said, but it’s an 
absolute certainty that my Lord 
Delph knew nothing of it. Mad he 
may be, but even he would have no 
commerce with T Ampere. Tread 
very carefully, friend Tito. There’s 
great mischief in the making in An- 
haritte, and T Ampere is behind 
it.” 



136 



IF 




XVIII- 



T HERE was no castle on 
Secondhill. The once-great 
fortress of TAmpere had been laid 
in ruins in some former conflict. 
Now its broken walls and chambers 
gaped amazedly at the sky, as if it 
could still not comprehend the fury 
that had destroyed it. At the foot of 
the ruins sat the neat circle of the 
chateau and the home estate. True, 
the complex was walled, but not in 
the sense of forming a stronghold in 
battle. T’ Ampere’s strength lay in 
other regions. 

To reach T Ampere, Ren had 
passed from Firsthill down through 
the slave market and crossed the 
ship lanes by slimboat. From here 
he had ascended Secondhill by the 
only access worthy of being called a 
road. 

The way had wound steeply up 
between the great banks of a 
natural pass. During the climb he 
had seen no signs of life or 
habitation. Breaking suddenly 
over the brow of the hill he-came 
upon the gates of the chateau be- 
fore he had guessed their nearness. 
Unlike the other hills, each of 
which had an attendant township 
gathered outside the citadel, 
Secondhill contained only the 
walled seat of TAmpere and im- 
mediately spread out to contain 
nothing but the broken, sheep- 



grazed slopes that reached down to 
the eastern plains and TAmpere 
province. 

Ren’s first impression that the 
Chateau TAmpere was undefended 
was soon corrected. His path 
toward the broad gates had placed 
him in a neat ambush. He found 
himself surrounded by some un- 
doubtedly competent soldiery and 
was 'forcibly conducted to a bar- 
racks associated with the great 
house and there interrogated by an 
officer. When he had established his 
identity a runner was despatched to 
ascertain Lady T’Amperp’s wishes 
in the matter. The message came 
back that Ren would be summoned 
when the lady pleased. Fuming at 
the treatment he was receiving, Ren 
found himself locked in a cell for 
two hours until a guide came to 
conduct him to Lady T Ampere. 

The rooms of TAmpere were 
depressing. Here was traditional 
Ahhn style used to an extreme 
extent, with carpets many 
centimetres ' thick ... strewn with 
cushions. Even the walls were 
smothered with heavy drapes and 
curtains. The screened windows 
admitted barely any light and what 
light did gain entrance was im- 
mediately absorbed by the browns 
and grays and blacks of the soft 
furnishings. Ren was reminded of 
the lair of a pampered cat — even 
the air seemed pungent with an 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



137 




overpowering feline smell. Here, he 
reasoned, was one more instance 
where nobility and absolute power 
over others had overfed itself to 
produce something mentally and 
physically unwholesome. It came to 
him that the Ahhn nobility had 
shown him little to commend its 
survival. Perhaps Dion’s revolution 
was fated to succeed. 

“You bring me an answer. Agent 
Ren?” T’ Ampere rose from the 
gloom, bright-eyed like a jungle 
creature regarding its prey. 

Ren longed to strike at the bright 
mockery. “Perhaps. But first I’d 
like an apology for being detained 
so long by your men. I came here at 
your invitation to answer a question 
you had asked. I resent being 
treated like a thief.” 

The amusement quickened in her 
face. “Believe me, if you saw what 
we did to thieves in TAmpere 
you would raise no such unjust 
accusation.” 

Ren saw she was playing with 
him and decided to deny her the 
pleasure of drawing a response. His 
dislike of the woman was now 
intense. 

“Lady TAmpere, yesterday you 
brought me a proposal — five 
hundred men at arms to use against 
Magda if the societies would pro- 
vide a like number. This they’ve 
agreed to do.” 

“A firm decision so quickly?” 



The feline eyes narrowed. “Eitherl 
you have remarkable powers off 
persuasion or the elders have be-f 
come mortally afraid of Dion.” \ 
“They didn’t take me into their | 
confidence. In this matter I act only i 
as messenger.” Ren felt disinclined ■? 
to elaborate. 

“I doubt that’s true.” She shook j 
her head impatiently. “But it’s of; 
no importance. At any rate we now 
have our alliance.” 

“We do not,” said Ren abruptly. 
“I said the societies had agreed. I 
didn’t say that I agreed.” 

A flicker of anger crossed her 
face. “And what objection do you 
have, merchant?” 

“When I climbed Secondhill I 
had no objection. But I want now to 
know why I was detained. Was it to 
make me conscious I was not of the 
Anharitte nobility? Or was it to 
keep me out of the way while some 
other plans were entertained?” 

“I find your impertinence less 
than amusing. Do you suspect me 
of duplicity?” 

“1 suspect the alliance you offer 
is not as simple as you claim.” 

“Grief! And do you also have a 
name for these other activities in 
which you think I’m involved?” 
Her voice held steely contempt. 

“At a guess I’d say they 
concerned Di Guaard and Sonel 
Taw.” 

Her face became clouded with 



138 



IF 




disbelief then relaxed into laughter. 

“You have my apology. Agent 
Ren. I mistook you for a fool. I see 
now why even Dion treats you with 
circumspection. You understand us 
far better than we understand 
ourselves. Let’s stop fencing with 
each other and conclude Our 
alliance. I perceive we make worthy 
partners in' mistrust.’’ 

“When I need your men I’ll send 
for them,” said Ren. “1 won’t make 
advance plans with you, because 
T’ Ampere has no talent for secrecy. 
When I ask for your men you are to 
send the full five hundred without 
delay and they will respond to my 
lieutenants, not their own ; Only on 
these terms can I afford to be in- 
volved with T Ampere.” 

“You’ve been well schooled,” she 
said thoughtfully. “It’s a good sign. 
Very well, your terms are accepted. 
If you cover yourself as well against 
your enemies as you do against 
your allies and should have a 
brilliant future in Anharitte. 
Indeed, I’ve a mind to make you a 
second proposition.” 

“Which is?” 

“I could use a man of your 
caliber at T’ Ampere. The rewards 
would be far and above anything 
the company could offer.” 

“In what capacity?” asked Ren 
without enthusiasm. 

“Consort,” said Lady TAmpere. 
Ren felt physically sick. “I’m 



afraid the proposition’s un- 
thinkable. For me to adapt to the 
ways of TAmpere is not possible- 
For TAmpere to adapt to me 
would need a major revolution.” 
“Then I’ll order runners to light 
your way down the slopes. Such 
paths can be treacherous.” 

“In the high places of Anharitte 
all paths seem to be treacherous,” 
said Ren. 

N IGHT had fallen by the time 
Ren left the Chateau 
TAmpere. The beautiful Rim stars 
were spread in a wide, bright pat- 
tern and such was their illumination 
that torches were not actually 
necessary. Nevertheless a dozen 
runners with flares were waiting to 
guide him down the path toward 
Firsthill and the light from their 
brands at first obscured a shifting 
redness in the western sky. 

Clear of the gates, Ren stopped 
and directed the runners to fall be? 
hind him so that he could better see 
the flame on the farther hill. An 
angry red patch seemed to burn on 
the left side of Firsthill, but its 
precise location was difficult to de- 
termine. As he continued down the 
pass the direct view of the confla- 
gration was lost to him and its exis- 
tence was told only by a continued 
redness in the sky. 

At the river he bade the runners 
return to their mistress. A slimboat. 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



139 




attracted by the light of the flares, 
came to ferry him across the ship- 
ping lanes. The boatman had no 
knowledge of the fire on Firsthill, 
but opted for the direction of Di 
Guaard when questioned about its 
probable location. Having gained 
the shore, Ren hurried through the 
now deserted slave market and was 
soon in the complex of streets at the 
top of the hill. A trade call alerted 
him to the presence of a waiting 
armsman from the Pointed Tails. 

“Agent Ren, Catuul asked that I 
intercept you on your return. He 
wishes to speak with you at the 
lodge. We must proceed with 
caution.” 

“What’s happening here?” asked 
Ren. 

“The slaves of Di Guaard have 
set fire to the castle. Rumor has it 
that Delph Di Guaard is slain. The 
prefect and his men are now in at- 
tendance, Catuul suggests it would 
be unwise for you to enter the 
district.” 

“He’s probably right. The timing 
of this affair is not without signifi- 
cance. Lead me by a safe route to 
the lodge.” 

The streets were crowded with 
sightseers drifting toward the scene 
of the fire. In the background a 
shadowy traffic of hurrying men in- 
dicated the messengers of various 
agencies going to report or being 
sent again to keep up with the news. 



The armsman hastened Ren 
through the slowly moving throng, 
turning aside always to avoid dark 
places. A constant chatter of in- 
quiry came from opened upper- 
story windows as bewildered heads 
tried to gauge the cause of the com- 
motion. The armsman stopped to 
engage no one in conversation. 
Though he did not speak of it, his 
movements seemed to anticipate 
danger at every corner and his hand 
was forever hovering near his 
sword. 

C ATUUL GRAS was waiting at 
the lodge. 

“Is it true that the slaves of Di 
Guaard have revolted?” Ren asked 
him. 

Catuul nodded. “It’s true. But 
they were incited to revolt.” 
“By whom? Not the Imaiz, 
surely?” 

“No, by the castellan, Sonel 
Taw. I think he saw in the ruse a 
chance to depose Lord Delph. But 
in any event he’s failed.” 

“Were the prefect’s men so quick 
to Delph’s defense?” 

“The prefect’s men were unable 
even to pass the outer walls. By the 
time they reached the castle the 
fight was over and most of the 
slaves were contained. Which ts for- 
tunate, because if they had escaped 
into Anharitte and gained support 
from their fellows the whole city 



140 



IF 




would probably be afire by now.” 

“I sensed as much,” said Ren. 
'Tensions are high in the streets 
tonight. But if Sonel Taw incited 
the slaves to riot, who was it who 
quelled them?” 

"A hundred bondsmen from 
Magda,” said Catuul, looking 
nowhere in particular. 

“Magda? Slave against slave? To 
protect Di Guaard?” 

Ren was fazed momentarily. 

, “I knew you’d not believe me, 
friend Tito, bu( 1 can only speak 
what I know. Though I doubt if it 
was Delph Di Guaard’s health they 
were interested in maintaining. I 
think they were as afraid as we of 
the incident’s starting a general 
uprising. With seven slaves in the 
district for every freeman, tonight 
could have been one of the bloodier 
pages of history.” 

“And if Di Irons had been forced 
to call in the government forces, it 
would have been even bloodier.” 
Ren nodded his acceptance of the 
logic. There was no doubt that if 
once the floodgates of violence tfere 
opened they would be extremely 
difficult to close. 

A commotion at the door broke 
up the conversation. Three of the 
Pointed Tails armsmen were strug- 
gling to subdue a prisoner they had 
taken from the streets, who had 
broken away at the last moment. 
Fortunately they were men who 



knew their trade. Shortly a tyxly 
was thrown through the door to 
land at Catuul’s feet. The scribe 
turned the wretch over wonder- 
ingly, a short dagger held to the 
man’s throat. With his windpipe in 
peril Sonel Taw, the castellan of Di 
Guaard, looked up from the floor in 
genuine anguish. 

“Ah! The idiot is here,” said 
Catuul with some satisfaction. 
“Witness the man who was crass 
enough to risk all Anharitte to 
satisfy his spite.” 

Sonel Taw noticed Ren and 
struggled to sit up. His face lit with 
an ingratiating smile of recognition. 

“Agent Ren knows me. He’ll tell 
you all is not as it seems. We have 
an understanding, the agent and I. 
Ren, keep these ruffians from my 
throat.” 

“I think not,” said Ren. “What 
you’ve provoked tonight could well 
have killed us all. If you had a quar- 
rel with Di Guaard you should have 
tried it man to man. But to involve 
the slaves could have resulted in a 
massacre.” 

“But — ” The castellan rose to his 
knees, his, eyes searching 
piteously for comprehension. “But 
it was part of the plan — ” 

“What plan?” 

“Hers — she toRT me of your 
intent — ” Taw had the look of a 
man betrayed. 

“That bitch . T’ Ampere,” said 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



141 




Ren. “She’s behind this. She 
thought by now to have me in her 
pocket.” - 

“But you aren’t?” inquired 
Catuul anxiously. 

“I agreed to nothing more than 
~-to send for her men as and when I 
required them against Magda. Di 
Guaard wasn’t even mentioned. In 
fact, she kept me at the chateau 
until Castle Di Guaard was well in 
flames." 

“Good. Then we aren’t com- 
promised. Tonight’s work has no 
reflection on our feud with the 
Imaiz. You’re a man of goodsense, 
friend Tito. And our fallen 
castellan here will find few to 
mourn his passing.” Catuul bent 
forward again with the dagger. 

Ren intervened. 

“Send your men to deliver him to 
Di Irons. He’s more the prefect’s 
concern than he is ours. I think a 
few days at the hands of Di Irons’ 
tormentors will be valuable to his 
education — and we’ve no time to 
lose over killing him.” 




“No time?” The Scribe regarded 1 
Ren curiously. “Your meaning es- i 
capes me.” j 

“A hundred men from Magda 
came to Firsthill: A hundred of the : ! 
same we’ll have to fight if we storm ■■ 
the castle. Doesn’t it make sense to 
see that as few as possible get back 
to Magda? They’re on our territory 
and they’ve a river to cross. We , 
have them at quite a disadvantage.” • 
Catuul considered for a moment, 
then leaped to his feet, shouting 
orders apd calling for men. His ac- 
ceptance of Ren’s point was im- 
mediate once he had explored the 
implications. He was secretly fu- ' 
rious with himself for not having 
realized so vital a matter earlier. 
Much valuable time had been lost 
and the men from Magda must by 
now be dispersed through the city 
and be making their way down to 
Firstwater. Leaving the hapless 
castellan in the company of 
armsmen charged with the duty of 
delivering him to the prefect, 
Catuul collected Ren and they sped 
out into the night. 

XIX 

A SYSTEM of messengers and 
. signals had alerted all the 
Pointed Tails, including those who 
acted as guards at the slave com- 
pounds on the edge of Firstwater. 
The first priority was to try to 



142 



IF 





locate the boats the men from 
Magda would try to use for their 
return. The second was to locate 
and harass the enemy itself. 

Ren found the whole operation 
confusing. Traveling at a steady 
run, usually by torchlight but occa- 
sionally by starlight alone, Catuul 
was a veritable mobile head- 
quarters. Out of the darkness 
messengers would gather to ex- 
change a few quiet words and be 
dispatched again to carry out some 
new command. Just how the 
messengers located Catuul Gras in 
the first place was quite beyond 
Ren’s comprehension — the scribe 
was constantly on the move. But 
the system appeared to work and 
gradually some semblance of order 
grew in the middle of apparent 
chaos. 

Resignedly Ren settled into a 
labored jog-trot, the nearest ap- 
proach he could make to the 
Ahhns’ effortless style of running. 
Nevertheless he found the going 
hard. At the foot of the Trade Road 
the scribe motioned the breathless 
agent to rest for a while. 

“We’re in luck, friend Tito. The 
news is that they’ve not yet crossed 
back over the water. Some were 
seen coming through the town and 
down the Blackslope. Others es- 
caped down Sidepath and must now 
be crossing the plain to join their 
fellows near the Black Rock. We’ve 



secured all the slimboats along 
Firstwater, but it looks now as 
though they must have made the 
crossing farther west. Now we must 
drive along the. riverbank as far as 
TEmpte Crossing and try to 
separate them from their boats.’’ 

“Will we be in time?” 

“Some are reported only a few 
minutes ahead of us and they may 
not yet realize we’re after them. 
They’ve only to stop and wait for 
their comrades on the other route 
and we shall trap them.’’ 

Ren nodded. He felt the ex- 
citement of the chase and this piece 
of harassment would be an ex- 
cellent chance to even the score 
with the Imaiz. He turned and 
followed Catuul eagerly toward the 
river. 

The whole scene was so utterly 
devoid of sounds or people that he 
found it nearly impossible to 
believe that only a short distance 
ahead were a hundred meii from 
Magda and a large attacking force 
of Pointed Tails determined to stop 
their escape into boats and across 
the river. After ten minutes Ren be- 
came seriously worried. He was al- 
most within sight of TEmpte 
Crossing and along the bank the 
slimboats used by the ferrymen 
were neatly drawn to cover and un- 
disturbed— but there still was no 
sign of Catuul or the enemy. 

Then he stopped, rubbing his eyes 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



143 




with disbelief. At first he thought 
his vision tricked by the dim light, 
but the continuous shine across and 
above the surface of the water was 
no chimera — it persisted and was 
real. Yet the image seemed to have 
no connection with the circum- 
stances in which he found it. Then, 
even as he watched, a sudden burst 
of flame on the far side of 
Secondwater reared upward and 
spread out along the curious 
shining thing spanning the river. 
The image began to collapse and 
Ren heard the shouts and calls of 
the Pointed Tails a little farther up 
the riverbank. 

Passing Magda Crossing, where 
the slimboats were now well 
secured by grinning armsmen, they 
advanced along the bank of 
Secondwater. This part of the way 
was clearer, there being no wharves 
or buildings along the bank. Here 
open fields led to a line of trees at 
the water’s edge and there was little 
concealment for men save the 
blanket of darkness. A series of 
trade calls began to sound from the 
direction of the Black Rock, now to 
their left across the fields, and 
Catuul answered them without 
hesitation. 

“Magda’s men are still on this 
side of the river,” the scribe told 
Ren. “They gather near the old 
T’Empte Crossing about a ki- 
lometer hence. There’ll be 



fighting — I’ll leave you here. Make 
your way to the crossing carefully. I 
think our trap is sprung.” 

Catuul called his men around him 
and together they trotted ahead. 
Ren, whose occupation and out- 
world training had ill prepared him 
for such marathon running, regret- 
fully watched them go. Although he 
was in excellent physical condition 
by outworld standards, he lacked 
schooling in the* style that enabled 
the native Ahhn to continue run- 
ning for hour upon hour with little 
sign of fatigue. He sat on a large 
projection of rock and rested for 
some minutes before continuing to 
walk slowly toward the appointed 
place. 

Ren had thought to hear sounds 
of battle ahead, but all was silent. 
This made him wary — perhaps the 
men from Magda had avoided the 
contact and were even now moving 
back across the fields. The light 
from the stars was insufficient for 
him to see more than a short 
distance around him. Every tree 
had the capacity to be a potential 
point of ambush. He walked as near 
the river’s edge as he dared, sword 
drawn and fully prepared to fight or 
run as the occasion might require. 

Intrigued by this mystery, Ren 
hastened forward. He should, he 
thought, by now be able to hear the 
sound of steel on steel, or the slap 
of an Ahhn crossbow. Instead all he 



144 



IF 




heard were voices and the un- 
mistakable trade calls of the 
Pointed Tails carrying reports to 
those farther afield. 

A RUSTLING at the treeline 
. made him stand, sword ready, 
until the call of a nightbird he 
recognized as Catuul’s signature 
sounded close to him. 

“The Imaiz has beaten us.” 
Catuul Gras appeared suddenly at 
Ren’s elbow. “Didn’t I tell you he 
was a wizard?” 

“What happened?” asked Ren. 
“Didn’t you catch them?” 

“They got away from us, all of 
them. Dion’s magic made a bridge 
of mist across the river and they ran 
over it. We could have taken some 
of them, but none of us dared ap- 
proach such a terrible thing.” 
“Damn! How did he manage 
that?” 

“I know nothing of the ways of 
wizardry,” said Catuul, slightly 
affronted. 

“A rhetorical question. I was 
thinking out loud,” said Ren. 
“Dion is no more a wizard than I 
am. And I tell you there’s no such 
thing as a bridge of mist that can 
bear the weight of a man. There has 
to be some rational explanation.” 
Despite Catuul’s obvious reluc- 
tance to follow, Ren moved along 
the river bank to where he had seen 
the curious shining thing on the 



water. Something submerged ap- 
peared to be distorting the surface 
of the river. He called for torches, 
but none were available. 

“Mark this spot, Catuul, and 
guard it. At first light I want boats 
here to explore both banks and drag 
out anything in the water. The river 
here is best part of a hundred and 
fifty meters wide — and a thing that 
could carry a hundred men across it 
in a few minutes can’t possibly have 
vanished without trace.” 

“Except a bridge of mist,” said 
Catuul, still unconvinced. 

W r EARY, Ren allowed himself 
to be escorted back to his 
chambers. Though his body was 
thoroughly tired, his mind persisted 
in wrestling with the problem of the 
intangible bridge. He could in no 
way reconcile a shine across the 
water and the scribe’s description of 
a bridge of mist with anything ca- 
pable of bearing the weight of a 
hundred men across the water yet 
able to vanish and leave no trace. 
Ren’s education had prepared him 
with a good grounding in what 
physical parameters he could nor- 
mally expect to encounter, but none 
of his knowledge of physics ap- 
peared relevant to the case. He was 
unwilling to admit that some un- 
known scientific principle might be 
involved, yet he was incapable of 
finding a satisfactory answer by 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



145 - 




employing any known principles. 

One reason for his intense preoc- 
cupation with the problem was his 
projected scheme for the storming 
of Castle Magda. He sensed in 
Catuul a superstitious awe of the 
works of the Imaiz that had to be 
dispelled if the campaign against 
Magda were to be a success. Unless 
Ren could prove to the Pointed 
Tails that the vanishing bridge was 
only a clever trick, they -would carry 
the attack against Magda burdened 
with the fear of some new 
manifestation of the Imaiz' s magic. 
It was easy to see that such a con- 
dition would give any maneuver a 
rather precarious chance of success. 

Firstlight seemed to come all too 
soon. Ren had taken his problem to 
bed and had lain awake with it for 
several hours despite his tiredness. 
When he finally succumbed to sleep 
it was for a few hours only. A 
servant came to wake him with the 
reminder that Catuul Gras would 
be waiting for him at T’Empte 
Crossing. Cursing the scribe for his 
apparent ability to do without 
sleep, Ren rose and washed but re- 
fused the delay of breakfast. 

Unable to face the long walk in- 
volved, he sent for stavebearers and 
took the cushion-craft, fretting all 
the way down the Trade Road amid 
the morning traffic of carriers’ 
carts. Once past the Black Rock 
and free from the restrictive atten- 



tions of the stave bearers, he turned 
off toward T’Empte Crossing. For 
the last part of the journey he went 
directly across the fields to where 
he could see a group of Pointed 
Tails on the riverbank. 

Catuul Gras received him with 
enthusiasm. Several men were in 
the river, diving deep to recover 
volumes of some substance they 
hauled ashore in a continuous 
strand and piled for Ren’s in- 
spection. Boats from the farther 
shore were fetching back a curious 
item found abandoned on the sandy 
beach, the purpose of which was 
completely obscure to the native 
Ahhn. 

W r HEN the collection was 
complete Ren inspected it 
briefly and the concept immediately 
fell into place. The shine across the 
waters, the idea of a bridge of 
mists, the carrying of a hundred 
men across the river — all these puz- 
zles suddenly had an explanation. 
Ren swore mightily when he 
realized the nature of the objects 
before him. Behind his compre- 
hension was an absolute certainty 
that the Imaiz was nothing more 
than a clever technician with a typi- 
cally Terran training. 

The items with which he had been 
presented consisted of a continuous 
length of heavy-gauge polythene 
sheet formed into a tube of a 



146 



IF 




diameter more than sufficient to 
admit a standing man, and a 
primitive large-capacity air bel- 
lows. Some sort of rush matting 
had additionally been provided to 
spread the weight of a man tra- 
versing the interior of the tube over 
water. A quantity of rope had been 
recovered which presumably had 
been used to haul the flexible “tun- 
nel” across the river and to secure it 
in place. 

“Tell me how it works,” im- 
plored Catuul Gras. 

Ren pursed his lips. “It’s an old 
Terran device. That large plastic 
tube, when filled with air, will float 
and will easily bear the weight of a 
man on the water. Fitted with flaps 
through which a man can enter 
without losing too much air and an 
air pump sufficient to keep it filled, 
it makes a floating bridge. It’s 
cheap, simple, and expendable — 
you can afford to set fire to it if you 
fear your enemies might try to 
follow you across.” 

“Then it isn’t magic?” asked 
Catuul. He sounded almost 
disappointed. 

“Far from it. In a smaller and 
modified form it’s used in a com- 
mon Terran water sport — men tie 
themselves into large plastic bub- 
bles and run races over lakes and 
rivers. It’s simply the clever appli- 
cation of a common out world 
principle.” 



“Which reinforces your sug- 
gestion that the Imaiz is a Terran?” 
“I don’t know.” Ren thought 
about his answer carefully. His 
words were colored by a new 
caution. “There’s a Terran in- 
fluence, certainly — but that could 
be acquired from books. The main 
factor that emerges from this affair 
is that Dion and his men are effec- 
tively policing Anharitte. They 
seem to be trying to prevent a 
catastrophic breakdown of your so- 
ciety even as they are undermining 
it. A restructuring without a revo- 
lution. Quite a trick— if you can 
achieve it.” 

“But didn’t Dion break faith with 
his own at Di Guaard yesterday? 
Slave against slave was something 
no one had expected.” 

“He broke faith only if you 
assume that his interest is the 
emancipation of the slaves. But 
perhaps his real policy is a larger 
purpose— that of emancipating the 
Ahhn as a race. But in any event I 
can’t see that either freetrade or the 
societies can survive the transition. 
We’re both part of the old pattern.” 
“So you intend to go through 
with your march on Magda?” 
asked Catuul gravely. 

“To Magda it is. And in view of 
Dion’s manumission bill this may 
well be the last chance we’ll get. I 
propose we strike Magda as soon as 
possible and with the largest force 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



147 




we can muster. Whatever happens, 
we mustn’t fail. A great many 
people will be watching the battle. 
If we lose, the Imaiz will not only 
gain Anharitte but probably his 
policies will win him all Roget as 
well. Our assault on Magda could 
have a great bearing on the shape of 
history. That’s why we must plan it 
well.” 

“What did you mean by the 
emancipation of the Ahhn ?” asked 
Catuul after a while. 

“It’s a relative concept that 
would only be apparent if you’d 
lived outworld,” said Ren, realizing 
his mistake. 

XX 

AT THE head of the Trade Road 
XjL the watchmen were waiting 
for Ren to return. Their inter- 
ception of him was swift and de- 
liberate. The stave-bearers were 
halted. 

“What’s the meaning of this?” 

“The prefect requires your 
presence, Agent Ren.” 

“Again? This is becoming too 
much of a habit. But it’s early and 
I’ve not yet breakfasted. Tell him I 
will come to him later.” 

The leading watchman shook his 
head. “Our orders were to bring 
you in all haste. The Lord Di Irons 
is in a fury.” 

“Then I’m afraid his fury must 



wait for a proper time. Stand 
aside.” 

Ren had observed that the stave- 
bearers had drawn to the side of the 
road and that the way in front of 
him was clear save for the three 
watchmen. The craft’s cushions 
were still inflated and he doubted 
the law-enforcers would stand in 
the path of the vehicle if it began to 
move. He edged it forward, slowly 
at first to warn the men out of his 
way, then faster. He was gratified 
to note that they made no attempt 
to halt his progress, but retired to 
the road’s edge to discuss the 
situation. 

Ren continued swiftly, having no 
thought of returning for the stave- 
bearers who still stood waiting for a 
decision from the watchmen. When 
he was out of weapon range he 
began to breathe more freely. This 
had been a trial of strength between 
himself and the authority of Di 
Irons — and for the moment he had 
won. As he drove unescorted to the 
fruit market he honestly questiQned 
his own motives for refusing to ac- 
cede to the watchmen’s demands. 
He found his reasons not as clear as 
they had seemed moments earlier. 
As one of the prime movers of 
events in Anharitte, he had come to 
resent the prefect’s imperious de- 
mands on his time. Yet now he 
thought about it, it grew more plain 
that he was attempting to set 



148 



IF 




himself up above the law — and the 
only persons above the law in An- 
haritte were the lords. 

He became interested — and 
slightly apprehensive — about how 
Di Irons would react. At worst, and 
if it suited the perfect’s purpose, Di 
Irons would be justified in detaining 
him and demanding his de- 
portation. At best, Di Irons might 
overlook the slight and await Ren’s 
coming at a later hour. Ren’s sur- 
mises, however, in no way covered 
the actual reaction his stand had 
provoked. 

Within the hour Di Irons himself 
was announced on his doorstep. 

“Didn’t you hear, Tito, that I 
needed words with you at once?’’ 

“My apologies. Prefect, but I was 
about early and was greatly in need 
of food. I was coming to see you 
soon.’’ 

The prefect waved the matter 
aside impatiently and accepted a 
plate at Ren’s table. 

“First I have to thank you for 
sending me Sonel Taw. Under 
threat of torment he has told me 
much that explains last night.” 

“Did he kill Di Guaard?” asked 
Ren. 

“The fool tried, though I doubt if 
he had the courage to perform the 
deed himself. Di Guaard died in the 
fire, nonetheless. But that wasn’t 
why I wanted words with you. Taw 
also hinted at a liaison between you 



and the Lady T’ Ampere. Can this 
be true?” 

“Liaison’s too strong a term. She 
has offered me men to reinforce my 
society in feud against Dion- 
daizan.” 

“At what price?” 

“I struck no bargain on price. 
She claims Dion is out to kill her — 
which may or may not be true, 
though I hope it is — and she offered 
me help if I would lead a strike 
against him. This I’ye agreed to do, 
but on my own terms.” 

“How many men did she offer?” 
Di Irons seemed angry, not with 
Ren directly but seemingly with all 
the world. 

“She suggested five hundred — if 
the society would find a like 
quantity.” 

“Five hundred? T’ Ampere has 
five thousand to use if she chooses. 
If you should take Magda, what do 
you suppose will happen to the rest 
of Magda province?” 

“I’d not given the matter a 
thought.” 

“Then I’ll tell you. With the 
Imaiz removed, T’ Ampere would 
take the rest of the province, be- 
cause nobody, not even I, could 
stop her. You’re the only man in 
Anharitte who would dare to take 
arms against Dion-daizan, so she 
sees in you a useful catspaw. If you 
should succeed you will hand her 
Magda province on a plate. If you 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



149 




lose she’s lost at most five hundred 
men. Do you now see in what 
you’ve become involved?” 

“I hadn’t known the details of her 
ambitions,” said Ren. “Therefore I 
find your warning timely. But I’m 
not sure it modifies my plan.” 

“I hadn’t expected you to be 
easily swayed. But if you’re still 
intent on turning Thirdhill into a 
battle ground you should at least 
know in what cause your blood is 
being spilled. It’s your life balanced 
against her gain. Do you think it a 
fair bargain?" 

“Are you trying to warn me not 
to proceed with the exploit?” 

“I don’t give a damn whether you 
proceed or not. You’ve almost no 
chance of winning and a very high 
chance of getting killed in the at- 
tempt. Even if you win, T’ Ampere 
will take the major prize. You can 
work out the odds for yourself. But 
I warn you — you’re engaged in an 
unholy alliance if you’ve listened to 
T Ampere. She’s made the almost 
identical proposition to most of the 
lords in the past, but history has 
taught them caution. Only T’Empte 
ever fell for the ruse.” 

“Catuul Gras spoke of T’Empte 
as an empty province. What hap- 
pened to the House of TEmpte?” 
“The House of T’Empte was 
destroyed partly by T Ampere’s 
treachery and partly because Dion’s 
revenge was so terrible. Since 



T’Empte was the catspaw, 
T Ampere escaped more lightly. 
The old vixen’s been sitting nursing 
her wounds these many years, 
waiting for someone else for her to 
thrust first into the fight with 
Dion.” 

“And now you think I’ve been 
elected?” 

“You’re the first new major force 
to emerge in Anharitte since the 
destruction of T’Empte. It was only 
a matter of time before you became 
included in her schemes.” 

“I’ll mark well what you’ve 
said,” said Ren. “1 promise it will 
be taken into account before a de- 
cision is reached. But if I decide to 
storm Magda — where will I find 
my Lord Di Irons standing?” 
“Slightly to your rear, looking 
the other way. You’re taking 
T’ Ampere’s banner. Noble house 
against Noble house still has legiti- 
macy — they have the right to bear 
arms anywhere in the city. Even the 
planetary government couldn’t ob- 
ject to your action under 

T’ Ampere’s shield. But the cost of 
digging your graves will certainly 
be passed on to your company.” 
“You paint a black picture.” 
“Traditionally the rocks of 
Thirdhill have been awash with the 
blood of attackers since the stones 
of Castle Magda were first raised. I 
see no reason to suppose that this 
occasion will be any different.”

IF 




S LOWLY Ren’s plans took 
shape. Dubious at first, Catuul 
Gras rapidly became an en- 
thusiastic convert when he saw the 
scope and thoroughness of the 
agent’s ideas. Much preliminary 
work needed to be done and 
Catuul’s standing with the elders of 
the clans foreshortened many 
otherwise lengthy negotiations. A 
large quantity of small boats was 
purchased along the coast to pro- 
vide ready transport both for the at- 
tack and the unlikely event of a 
forced withdrawal. Canvassing 
around the Tyrene villages 
produced scores of useful contacts 
whose services would be needed 
when the great day came. Ren 
watched the steadily mounting bill 
for purchases and bribes and knew 
that this was goihg to be his final 
attempt. If this venture failed he 
was unlikely to be given the money 
or the opportunity to try again. He 
had to succeed. 

The more involved Catuul Gras 
became with the planning of the ex- 
ploit, the more he began to ap- 
preciate how Ren’s unique out- 
worlders’ view of Anharitte threw 
up ideas and perspectives by no 
means apparent to those who had 
spent their lives in the city. Al- 
though Ren’s knowledge of Ahhn 
history was not complete, his 
understanding of the causes and 
motivations of political events was 



a revelation to the scribe. Ideas 
which in outline were received in 
doubtful silence won enthusiastic 
favor when Ren placed them in 
careful context. Whatever the 
results of the coming battle, the 
event was certain to find a 
permanent place in Anharitte’s 
history. 

For Ren the affair, was 
necessarily a compromise. After his 
experiences with Alek Hardun he 
felt compelled to eschew the 
benefits of modern outworld 
weaponry. This limited his armory 
to what could be made or found 
from native resources. However, he 
felt no such limitations on his inge- 
nuity. Ahhn craftsmen found 
themselves building instruments of 
siege and war which belonged not 
to their own history but to that of 
another race far across the 
legendary stars. 

Logic dictated that rocket pro- 
jectiles would have been more ef- 
fective against Magda than 
ballistae and chain-cannon, but 
Ren was aware of a growing sense 
of responsibility toward the Ahhn. 
The release of too much advanced 
weaponry into their feudal society 
could have destroyed them just as 
effectively as if the ships of Ranee 
had succeeded in their task; Al- 
ternately, to go into battle ill-pre- 
pared was to invite disaster. 

Nor were the words of Di Irons 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



151 




on T Ampere -overlooked. In his 
planning Ren had attempted to 
cover all of the many aspects of the 
exercise brought to his attention 
and several facets which he had de- 
termined for himself. Overall he 
had contrived to construct a time of 
chaos such that even the prefect 
would find it difficult to determine 
exactly what was taking place. It 
was also hoped that even the 
Imaiz’s spies would present such a 
mass of irrelevant information to 
Dion that much could be achieved 
before the true pattern of the attack 
became apparent. All in all, Ren 
was rather pleased with his design. 
He was certain that Director Veste- 
vaal would have given the whole 
scheme his heartiest approval. 

At last Ren was ready to make 
his move. With the initial attack on 
Magda scheduled for late afternoon 
a messenger was sent that morning 
to call out T Ampere’s men. The 
messenger returned with the news 
that the party from Secondhill 
would join them at midday. This 
was largely as Ren had anticipated. 
He then waited for reports from the 
spies he had posted on T’ Ampere’s 
borders before ordering his men 
into the field. 

His judgment proved correct. 
Coincident with the sending of five 
hundred men from T’ Ampere to 
join Ren’s sortie against Magda, 
the mistress of Secondhill had or- 



dered nearly ten times that number 
of men to the shores of the River 
Daizan in the east, flanking Magda 
province. When he had received 
confirmation of this fact, Ren 
caused signals to be flown to set in 
motion the next phase of his plan. 
T’ Ampere was due for a nasty 
shock. 

The notion pleased Ren — it was 
with a wolfish smile on his face that 
he went to marshal his own forces. 
Against agreement, the five 
hundred from T Ampere came 
complete with their own officers. 
These were neatly disarmed by the 
Pointed Tails and removed from 
the scene with some alacrity. 
Moreover, the five hundred were 
outnumbered at least two to one by 
members of the Pointed Tails and 
other societies brought in by Catuul 
as reinforcements. Lacking more 
direct orders from T’ Ampere, the 
five hundred accepted the viewpoint 
offered them and soon became in- 
tegrated in the total army marching 
on Thirdhill. 

I T WAS thus with fifteen 
hundred men rather than a thou- 
sand, that Ren crossed Firstwater 
to Magda’s shores. Here again his 
strategy was not immediately ob- 
vious. Instead of taking the hill 
road leading directly up to the 
township and thence to the castle 
his men marched round at the foot 



152 



IF 




of the slopes defining the hill — only 
when they had formed a full circle 
around Thirdhill did they begin to 
ascend. Even then their activity was 
limited. At the rough contour 
where the grasslands gave way to 
the steeper outcrops of gray rock on 
which the township and castle of 
Magda stood, they halted and 
began to prepare their positions as 
if in readiness for a siege rather 
than a direct attack. 

Below the siege line other teams 
were busy setting up the various 
engines and devices of Ren’s, design 
and dragging them up the hill to 
stations at carefully determined 
points. The sun set on a deceptively 
quiet scene, the growing glow of 
campfires spreading out along the 
side of the hill like a string of bright 
beads. In only a few places did 
activity continue after nightfall. 
Watchers in Castle Magda could 
have seen little of these secret 
details, because the devices were 
still concealed in dead ground and 
safely out of sight of the castle. 

The first sign of renewed action 
came when the fires on the hillside 
facing firstwater leaped into new 
life as blocks of pitch and barrels of 
crude tar were thrown upon them. 
The lazy breeze from the southwest 
carried the heavy smoke in the di- 
rection of the castle and effectively 
screened the movements Ren had 
planned for his secret weapons. 



These he now deployed forward to 
occupy positions behind preselected 
outcrops of rock that would serve 
to shield them from direct fire. 
Having relocated the devices to his 
satisfaction, Ren returned to a safe 
position to await the coming of first 
light. 

Dawn brought the first skirmish. 
The defenders of Magda, ap- 
parently reluctant until now to 
show their awareness of the army 
gathered around them, sent out a 
reconnaissance party to test the 
strength of the enemy. The Pointed 
Tails were ready for them. Al- 
though Dion-daizan’s men bore 
small muskets of a type similar to 
those favored by the ill-fated Di 
Guaard, they were no match for the 
hail of steel shafts from the cross- 
bows of the society armsmen. The 
reconnaissance party lost two men 
and retreated quickly back inside 
the castle gates. The attackers lost 
no men at all in the incident and 
achieved a great improvement in 
morale. 

The coming of the early sun 
brought a slight freshening of the 
wind, which nevertheless held its 
prevailing course. This was 
precisely what Ren had hoped and 
led naturally into the next phase of 
his campaign. With the majority of 
his troops still holding a tight ring 
around the outer slopes, he again 
caused certain fires to be made to 



THE WIZARD OF ANH ARITTE 



153 




smoke and, under cover of the 
dense vapor clouds, he and twenty 
selected men gained the forward 
positions where their secret 
weapons had been sited. The fires 
were doused at a signal and into the 
clearing air above the frowning 
castle a large balloon rose uncer- 
tainly, trailing a canister on a rope 
beneath it. 

T HIS first balloon rose too 
slowly and snagged against a 
high battlement, its canister dan- 
gling against the outer wall. After a 
time the burning fuse expired and 
the canister fell outside the wall to 
explode at its foot. Although the ex- 
plosive was a native product, its 
quality was sufficient to make a 
very creditable bang. In its situa- 
tion it did no damage, but it was a 
welcome foretaste of what such a 
device could do if it fell inside the 
castle confines. 

The next balloon was prepared in 
recognition of the fate of the' first. 
It rose more swiftly, clearing the 
battlements with ample margin. 
The fuse, too, had been altered and 
made slightly longer and the at- 
tackers had the immense satis- 
faction of seeing the canister plum- 
met from a height and fall squarely 
inside the castle walls. There was no 
way to assess what damage the ex- 
plosion might have caused, but its 
arrival must certainly have been a 



trial to the defenders. Much 
structural damage was not to be ex- 
pected, but the more sophisticated 
the defenses, the more they would 
suffer from casual bombardment. 

Eight more balloons were 
released. The first six all delivered 
their explosive charges somewhere 
within the castle confines. Although 
they were subjected to rapid musket 
fire from inside Magda, the small 
balls projected by the weaponry 
were insufficient to damage the 
balloon fabric in any way that ap- 
preciably foreshortened the flight. 
The seventh balloon was shot down 
well before it had covered the 
distance to the castle. Ren fancied 
that a more powerful weapon, such 
as a Terran rifle, had been brought 
to bear on this. The eighth balloon 
was shot to pieces almost im- 
mediately upon release, and Ren 
and his comrades scarcely escaped 
with their lives as the canister fell 
back on top of them. 

Seeing the growing effectiveness 
of the defensive measures, Ren de- 
cided that the idea had been taken 
far enough. Under cover of a new 
wave of smoke he ordered a retreat 
and made his way back to his now 
jubilant forces, quite satisfied with 
the progress he had made. Seven 
explosive charges had been de- 
livered into Magda and although 
they would not have caused very 
much damage to such a massive 



154 



IF 




structure, their effect both physical 
and psychological on the defenders 
could not have been negligible. 
Most gratifyingly, all this had been 
accomplished without the loss of a 
single man. 

Meanwhile, Catuul Grass had 
been visiting the township below the 
castle. He had found the people 
fully aware of the situation and 
anxious about their own lives and 
property. Catuul had struck a bar- 
gain with them— he would restrict 
armed offensives to the vicinity of 
the castle proper if the townsfolk 
would agree to attempt no action in 
support of Dion-daizan. His pro- 
posal had been rejected until he 
pointed out the strength of the at- 
tacking force and the indefensibility 
of the scattered conglomeration of 
buildings of the township. If defied, 
he had said, he was quite prepared 
to raze the town by fire. On this 
point of understanding he had 
taken his leave, but had not forgot- 
ten to post pickets on all paths out 
of the town as a reminder to the 
townsfolk that they were not free 
agents in this time of war. 

R EN was concentrating now on 
» moving his men up closer to 
the castle, so that he could start to 
use the engines he had brought. The 
maneuver proved more dangerous 
than he had calculated. The mus- 
kets of Magda proved to have an 



unexpected range and accuracy — 
and at least one high-powered rifle, 
probably with telescopic sights, was 
being deployed against his men. His 
losses were mounting, despite all 
his efforts at caution and it became 
obvious that a daylight attack 
would be suicidal. Reluctantly he 
retreated to the safety of the seige 
line and caused his ballistae to be 
prepared. 

He had intended the ballistae to 
be used at shorter range, but he 
knew that the smaller missiles 
could be hurled for considerable 
distances, though the accuracy of 
range left much to be desired. For- 
tunatly, knowing of the strength 
of Magda’s walls, he had not in- 
tended to try to use brute force to 
make a breach. Instead he had 
concentrated primarily on the 
manufacture of fire bombs. These 
were earthenware vessels filled with 
inflammable spirit and ignited by a 
wick, which would burst and spread 
a formidable area of flame around 
the point of impact. 

Now Ren rearranged the 

ballistae for maximim effect at a 
distance and had the smaller fire 
bombs „ segregated ready for 

loading. The losses his force had 
sustained earlier in the day weighed 
heavily on his conscience. With this 
in mind, he was overcautious about 
keeping his men well under cover 
and out of the line of fire. Here he 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



155 




sensed he was failing in his duties as 
a commander of an aggressive 
force. He grudgingly acknowleged 
that he was a merchant concerned 
with profit and loss rather than life 
and death and that he placed more 
faith in the unorthodoxy of his 
weapons to gain Magda than he did 
in the power of flesh and bone to 
storm a castle so well defended. 

The ballistae functioned well. 
About sixty per cent of the pro- 
jectiles actually fell within the walls 
of Magda. The effect was difficult 
to gauge, but the persistence of 
smoke trails long after the spirit 
would have naturally burned out 
was evidence that at least some of 
the fire bombs had ignited combus- 
tibles within the castle. He had a 
mental picture of the vessels 
smashing against walls and win- 
dows and the torrents of flaming 
spirit being spattered well into the 
interior of Magda's installations. 
Apart from a direct hit, it was 
doubtful whether the practice 
would do much damage to the 
personnel, but no organization, 
however structured, could function 
without stress in the face of rapid 
and randomly occurring outbreaks 
of fire. 

XXI 

W r HILE he was engaged in 
pressing this newest mode of 



attack Ren had a visitor. Di Irons, 
grim and heavy and rustily bearded, 
pulled himself up the slopes and 
was guided to the place where Ren 
was directing operations. The 
prefect gave the impression of being 
tired of his world. 

“If ever a man could name a 
common cause for all his mis- 
fortunes that man is I. And the 
name of the misfortune is Tito Ren. 
What are you trying to do, Tito? 
Set all Anharitte on fire?” 

“Only Castle Magda — at the 
moment. Did you have something 
on your mind, Prefect?” 

“The Tyrene attacked again — the 
first time in over forty years. It’s 
too much of a coincidence to 
suspect your hand isn’t behind it. 
Only/ a historian could have 
planned a coup like that. Don’t you 
agree?” 

Ren shrugged blandly. “They al- 
ways told me the Tyrene pirates 
were a myth. I may be blamed for 
interfering with your history, but it 
seems to be taking the point a bit 
far to include mythology. Perhaps 
the ghost of Di Guaard has chased 
them from the cellars of the dead?” 
“I’ll wager it was some more 
lively spirit,” said Di Irons heavily. 
“Especially as you canvassed 
heavily along that shore.” 

“Tell me about their coming,” 
asked Ren innocently. 

“T’Ampere lost a fortune. To 



156 



IF 




protect the chateau itself she had to 
call back much of the army she had 
originally sent to the edge of 
Magda province. They were so late 
returning that the chateau itself had 
been overrun in the meantime. The 
Tyrene took every single thing of 
value including her considerable 
treasury, fired the chateau, then 
retreated to the river. T’ Ampere’s 
men tried to give chase but were 
balked by the fact that you had al- 
ready acquired all the available 
boats. To complete her misfortune 
Dion’s men followed those she had 
called back and have occupied 
several of T’ Ampere’s own 
estates.” 

“Aiee!” shrieked Ren. “And I 
thought all the action was taking 
place up here.” 

“Far from it. And I’d advise you 
not to get too close to T’ Ampere in 
the future. She knows well whom to 
blame for today’s work. Clever you 
may be, but your ways are rather 
obvious.” 

“Did you climb all this way just 
to offer me that advice?” 

“Not really. I was interested in 
your progress against Dion. You 
realize, of course, that your 
continued presence here is not due 
ta your own efforts, but due to 
some reluctance on the part of Dion 
to swipe you away as one would a 
fly.” 

“I doubt the truth of that, but I’d 



be interested in knowing how you 
come to that conclusion.” 

“It’s a factor most of us tend to 
forget, but one brought well to 
mind by Dion’s occupation of some 
of T’ Ampere’s estates today. To us, 
soldiers are all freemen, merce- 
naries or armsmen of societies. But 
even slaves will fight in the service 
of Dion-daizan — and today a great 
many of them fought against 
T’ Ampere. Furthermore, they were 
both armed and trained. Consider 
the implication, Tito. Dion can 
outman your army ten to one any 
time he chooses and not even feel 
the strain. And the majority of his 
men are already outside Castle 
Magda — they have you sur- 

rounded.” 

“There’s been no sign of in- 
terference from his men in the 
province.” 

“Then the fact that he hasn’t 
called on them must mean either 
that he considers you no threat or 
that he’s confident that his garrison 
here can deal with you adequately 
on their own. Your prospects don’t 
look too bright either way.” 

Ren surveyed the sky. The sun 
was already beginning to draw 
down on the horizon. 

“Did you ever think, my Lord, 
that the Imaiz may not be 
infallible? When darkness falls I 
intend to take these ballistae closer 
so that we can throw even larger 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



157 




jars of flaming spirit inside those 
walls. No matter how good his 
defenses, they can't function if 
they’re afire. When the garrison is 
fully occupied putting out blazes 
we’ll launch our main attack on the 
gates. If we can manage to 4 breach 
even one gate successfully we’ll run 
whole barrels of spirit inside the 
walls and fire these also. We have 
the catapults, we have the ramps 
and we have more than enough 
combustables to fill Magda with a 
sea of flame. Are you thinking that 
Dion can withstand even that?” 

“It’s a good plan and a bold 
one,” said Di Irons grudgingly. 
“On the face of it, you should suc- 
ceed. But I’ll wager the Imaiz 
knows every detail of the scheme. If 
he has not yet moved against you 
it’s because he knows your chances 
of success are quite remote.” 

“On that point we’ll agree to dif- 
fer. Only the morning will tell 
which of us was right.” 

“I think you’ll find it a long 
night. And I wish you welcome to 
it, Tito. This is one night I’ve no 
wish to spend on Thirdhill. If I 
can’t persuade you to your senses 
I’ll take my leave. I think tomor- 
row there’ll be many graves to 
supervise.” 

W HEN the prefect had gone 
Ren spared no time in calling 
together his lieutenants and 



ensuring that they were all in ac- 
cord with the details for the coming 
battle. The ballistae were handed 
over to teams which had been 
instructed carefully on both the 
method and the timing of their use. 
The general relocation of troops 
had already begun and every 
foreseen aspect of the campaign 
had been fully covered. After a final 
inspection of the stockpiles of in- 
flammables and the supply lines on 
which so much of the plan de- 
pended Ren gave the final order to 
proceed. 

Though no one knew it but 
himself, he had approached his 
final moment of decision with 
mixed feelings. Di Irons was a 
hard-headed realist, whose know- 
ledge of probabilities in Anharitte 
was not lightly to be dismissed. Di 
Irons had predicted that the attack 
would fail. While Ren did not 
concur, he had to allow that the 
prefect’s opinion was based on life- 
long experience in Anharitte and 
carried a great deal of weight. Ren 
was not one to dismiss informed 
opinion lightly, and to underesti- 
mate Dion-daizan could be fatal. 

Because he and Catuul were to 
join the selected armsmen who were 
to make the attack on the main 
gates, Ren and the scribe made a 
circuituous journey first west and 
then north to a point well below the 
township where part of the at- 



158 



IF 




tacking party was mustering. Here 
were men fresh into the field, 
having just arrived up the Magda 
Road where they had been en- 
camped as a reserve. They had 
completed their journey on time 
and Catuul was pleased to find that 
everything was in excellent order. 

The close warmth of the early 
night was beginning to fade as the 
assembled troop moved off up the 
ragged road that followed the up- 
ward slope between the dark ridges 
of the hill. The prognosis for the at- 
tack was promising. Ren had 
handpicked men fresh to the battle 
and backed up by the small carts 
carefully laden with more than suf- 
ficient inflammables to fire the 
castle. Even Catuul was beginning 
to feel that the operation must 
succeed. 

The wheels of the carriers’ carts 
which regularly used this route had 
worn shallow grooves into the 
granite of the underlying rocks. In 
the moonless light from the Rim 
sky Ren found these furrows a 
useful guide to his feet and 
presenting a surface certainly more 
congenial to walk upon than the 
broken roughness of the rest of the 
road. About fifty men were ahead 
of him and as many following. In 
the true tradition of the societies 
the whole column moved silently, 
neither singing nor talking, their 
soft steps giving no indication that 



an army was on the march. Even 
the wheels of the little carts had 
been muffled. Ren found their 
quietness almost eerie. He was 
acutely conscious of the sound of 
his own boots on the hard un- 
derfooting. 

T HUS it was that the ca- 
tastrophe was the more terri- 
fying because it lacked any warning 
and because many of those who 
died did so with scarcely time to 
raise a shocked scream to their lips 
before they were destroyed. From 
somewhere out of the darkness a 
giant boulder, roughly spherical, 
plunged from a high place and 
thundered with sickening mo- 
mentum between the cheeks of the 
road. Such was its force and unex- 
pectedness that the first part of the 
column was crushed before the men 
had time to realize the nature of the 
thing which had leaped upon them. 
Comprehension of the nature of the 
threat was accompanied by a wild 
scramble by those following to 
climb the banks to avoid being 
mashed. 

Weighing many hundred tons, 
the boulder had been finely calcu- 
lated to fit the contours of the road 
without becoming embedded in the 
banks. Its trajectory must have 
been set for maximum effect in this 
precise application. Certainly its 
release from a place of rest on an 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITE 



159 




adjacent hillside was no accident, 
but even the authors of the mis- 
fortune could scarcely have hoped 
for such a truly devastating effect. 
The boulder went straight through 
the column of marching men, 
grinding flesh and bone alike into 
the dust. Even the frail carts at the 
rear were crushed completely, 
together with the patient animals 
and the men who held their reins. 
The only ones who were spared 
were those who were quick enough 
to break -formation and climb the 
bank in time to save theniselves. 

Aghast, Ren rose from the side of 
the bank where he had thrown 
himself and tried to estimate the 
severity of the damage. At least 
thirty were dead and as many more 
injured. The enormity of the 
damage and its improbable 
swiftness robbed him of words. The 
impact of that one great stone 
somehow symbolized all he had 
been told of the wrath of the Imaiz. 
In abstract such anger had been 
something to face with equa- 
nimity — translated into crushed 
flesh and shattered bones, its aspect 
assumed a far more daunting hue. 
The rumble of the boulder still 
traveling down the distant slopes 
was audible above the cries of the 
injured. Ren was sick on the spot. 

Catuul Gras had taken command 
while Ren attempted to draw 
himself out of his shock. Already 



messengers had been sent to fetch 
help and sick-wagons for the in- 
jured. The fit men had been drawn 
aside and counted and lost weapons 
were replaced by arms taken from 
the dead. In battle the Pointed Tails 
remained practical to the last. 

“Friend Tito, we’re ready to 
proceed.” 

The scribe was sympathetic 
toward Ren’s condition, but knew 
the whole battle was lost if the com- 
mander faltered. Ren, feeling the 
true pains of responsibility for the 
massacre of so many of those he 
had hired, would have preferred to 
have retired from the fight at that 
point. It had once more been driven 
home to him that he was a 
merchant, not a soldier, and that 
fighting was only a part of a com- 
mander’s burden — the other part 
was the acceptance of death, his 
own and those of his men. This was 
one aspect of making war that had 
never been made apparent to him in 
books. 

At the back of his mind the clear 
voice of conscience reminded him 
that those who had died had given 
their lives for the maintenance of 
the freetrade principle — but the 
benefits of the principle’s survival 
would go almost entirely to the 
nameless outworld moguls who 
controlled the strings of interstellar 
trade. Catuul’s men had died in the 
service of someone else’s greed.

R EN pulled himself together sud- 
* denly. The realities of the 
situation became brutally clear. 
Whatever the morality, he was al- 
ready committed. There could be 
no turning back. 

“I’m with you, Catuul. Have you 
sent for reinforcements?” 

“No. But we’ll be joining the rest 
of the party at the township. That’ll 
have to be enough. They’ll have 
extra combustibles also.” 

The remaining element of the 
troop continued with the march. 
Heeding the lesson so desparately 
learned, they broke file and walked 
high on the banks above the road in 
case a second boulder should follow 
the first. To their right the hill rose 
steeply into the blackness of a co- 
niferous wood perched precariously 
high against the towering skyline 
and it was a reasonable certainty 
that those responsible for launching 
the boulder were still up there 
among the trees. 

Catuul called for scouts and sent 
them ahead up the bank to as- 
certain what dangers might still be 
lurking. Ten minutes later a minor 
landslide heralded something 
rolling down the slopes. Cautious 
investigation revealed the bodies of 
the scouts with their throats cut. 
They had been rolled back down to 
rejoin their comrades. At no time 



had there been any sight of or 
sound from the hidden enemy, and 
Catuul viewed the road ahead with 
considerable apprehension. 

Ren decided on a detour. His rea- 
soning was that their progress along 
this particular road had been an- 
ticipated and the route would 
probably contain several further 
traps. If they struck a new path 
across country they might en- 
counter nothing more than random 
patrols. Catuul agreed and the 
party made a wide detour that 
much later fetched it to the road at 
the entrance to the township. 

Here the rest of the attackers 
were waiting — and listening to an 
agitated messenger who had been 
unable to locate Catuul in the 
darkness. The messenger held a 
long and involved conversation with 
Catuul and repeatedly pointed be- 
yond Magda to where Ren was be- 
ginning to discern a broad area of 
light in the sky. Finally Catuul ap- 
proached him to report. 

“Some of the ballistae are in 
trouble. Dion used cannon to knock 
a couple of them out. He had also 
managed to project some sort of in- 
cendiary into two of our stockpiles. 
The fires you see are our own 
emplacements burning.” 

“Have we still enough ballistae to 
set Magda afire?” 

“Easily enough. We’ve seven left 
and even three would be adequate.” 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



161 




“Then let them commence firing. 
The quicker we can move now, the 
more surely we can win. Are we 
ready to assault the castle gates?” 

“The men are ready. We’re 
waiting for some more tar and oil 
to get through to replace some we 
lost, but it can follow us later. First 
we have to get into attack 
position.” 

“Then let’s get on with it,” said 
Ren. “We’ve still a fair way to go to 
reach the castle and Dion’s ob- 
viously expecting us.” 

Soon the sounds of renewed 
hostilities became loud in the air. 
The night sky began to echo to the 
firing of muskets and the occa- 
sional roar of cannon. Although 
nothing was yet to be seen, Ren 
knew that his ballistae must have 
already started launching the great 
spirit jars over Magda’s walls. Soon 
he hoped to see evidence of fires 
within the castle perched directly 
above where he now stood. It was 
necessary that his assault troops 
moved swiftly into position ready to 
seize the most advantageous time to 
breach the gates. Ren began to feel 
better. His previous horror was 
soon lost in the preoccupation of re- 
newed activity. 

The township of Magda was built 
of streets steeply sloped toward the 
castle at its head. The inhabitants 
had wisely stayed inside their 
houses and behind locked doors — 



the streets were deserted save for 
where Ren’s army thronged the 
lower square. The way ahead up the 
narrow cobbled street was lit by oc- 
casional watch flares which dimly 
illuminated the way almost to the 
foot of the castle. 

Despite the apparent overtness of 
the action Catuul insisted that a 
small troop of men go ahead to 
ensure that no ambush had been 
laid from the dark alleys that laced 
the township. Ren felt that his role 
should have placed him at their 
head, but he acquiesced to Catuul’s 
more informed objection. Catuul 
needed men he had trained. The 
scouting party would be visible 
right to the top of the hill and could 
easily exchange signals with the 
men below. 

R EN’S decision to remain was 
* nearly the cause of his im- 
mediate death. The square was 
flanked by buildings formed from 
the traditional granite of the hills. 
Without warning — and by obvious 
design — one of these collapsed, its 
walls falling outward to scatter 
granite blocks far across the square 
and on the heads of the unfortunate 
troops mustered beneath. The 
nature of the mechanics by which 
this trick was wrought was not ap- 
parent, but its effect was catastro- 
phic. As the walls had begun to 
bulge Catuul had thrown Ren clear 



162 



IF 




and the agent had received merely a 
startled impression of an ap- 
parently solid wall of masonry 
seeming to become plastic as it bent 
and twisted outward to engulf a 
great many of his men. 

- Shaken by his second near escape 
of the evening, Ren’s reaction this 
time was one of immense anger. He 
was sure the scheme could not have 
been devised and executed without 
the foreknowledge and cooperation 
of the inhabitants and he charged 
Catuul to make them pay for their 
indiscretion as soon as it was light. 
Meanwhile Ren’s own task was be- 
coming increasingly urgent. The 
scouting party reported by light 
signals that the way was apparently 
safe and clear. Leaving fresh dead 
and wounded to be extricated from 
the ruins of the building, Ren 
started up the road, calling for men 
to follow him to the gates of 
Magda. 

Had he given the matter more 
thought Ren might have been less 
brave. As he strode ahead he 
realized that even in the dim 
flarelight his merchant’s costume 
must have made him conspicuous 
among the armsmen and rendered 
him an easy target for a trained 
sniper. A sharpshooter with a 
modern electron-optic rifle hidden 
in one of Magda’s towers could 
have killed him at any moment. 
From his experience with the 



balloons Ren was reasonably 
certain that Dion did possess some 
of these weapons. He was forced to 
recognize that he was relying on the 
Imaiz voluntarily limiting his show 
of arms to those that would seem to 
be appropriate to the type of battle 
being offered. 

Both he and Dion were playing a 
game — a war game carefully 
dressed to suit the character and 
background of Anharitte. But at 
what point would Dion’s hand be 
forced so that he would be playing a 
game no longer? At some point be- 
fore he was broken the Imaiz would 
be forced by the dictates of survival 
to drop the pretense and reply with 
whatever weapons he possessed, 
regardless of their origin or pro- 
priety. Or did Dion truly have his 
boulder and falling-wall technique 
so well organized that even now he 
had no fear of the army moving up 
the sloping street? 

Halfway up the hill Ren heard a 
shout from the men above him. He 
called back, anxious to know what 
they had found. He was not long 
left doubting. With a hideous clat- 
ter a large wheeled cart, heavily 
laden with blocks of stone and held 
unnoticed in some recess, had 
begun to run down the slope toward 
him. The very narrowness of the 
street precluded the escape of all 
but the lucky as the juggernaut hur- 
tled with ever increasing mo- 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



163 




mentum toward the knot of an- 
guished men. 

On either side the sleeping houses 
left neither gaps nor alcoves nor 
opemdoors through which the men 
might escape. The width of the cart 
was nearly three quarters of the 
width of the road itself and, al- 
though it must leave some men 
unharmed, the trick would be to es- 
timate precisely against which wall 
one should hug one’s self and hope. 
At one point the cart snagged 
against brickwork and the iron ' 
bands of its hubs shot visible sparks 
into the air and threatened to divert 
the cart to a stop against the wall. 
But the vehicle broke free, ran 
across the road, ricochetted off the 
other side and centered again on its 
murderous course. 

Ren took the only action open to 
him. Trying to judge the most 
probable path the vehicle would 
take, he pressed himself against a 
wall and prayed. His prayer was 
not answered. By an apparently 
willful deviation of its direction the 
thundering cart moved again across 
the road and soon was upon him. 

Even before the flying wheels 
made contact Ren knew his injury 
was going to be savage. The weight 
and speed of the unattended jug- 
gernaut left no doubt of the out- 
come. When it hit him he was going 
to be crushed. The heavy axle 
caught his thigh, and he went partly 



over the shaft and partly between it 
and the wall. The shock and pain 
of so grave an injury was merci- 
fully foreshortened by uncon- 
sciousness — but he remembered 
thinking, as the fringes of darkness 
closed about him, that with those 
sort of injuries he would prefer not 
to live. 

Some unknown time later he 
partially awoke — enough to be con- 
scious of bright flares around him 
and of an unnatural numbness. He 
could see Eynes, the surgeon from 
the spaceport, bending over him, 
instruments in hand. Somewhere 
behind the surgeon and barely in 
focus the red-on-gold emblems of 
the sick- wagon of the Society of 
Pointed Tails danced in the 
flickering flames. He could hear Di 
Irons’ voice, but could not see him. 
Ren tried to concentrate on what 
was being said. 

“I’ll not let them take him 
. .there’s not one society hospital 
in Anharitte has a chance of 
repairing that!** 

Eynes cut in plaintively. “We’d 
need the operating theater facilities 
of a Stellar Cruiser to save him — 
and the nearest must be better than 
three weeks out.’’ 

There was another gap in time, 
then a slight return to con- 
sciousness as the whisper of a 
cushion-craft cut through the en- 
veloping clouds of internal 



164 



IF 




darkness. He caught a glimpse of 
Eynes’ face by torchlight, a picture 
of worried indecision followed by a 
shrug and a gesture that meant ca- 
pitulation. Firm hands gently 
rocked Ren — next he dimly 
recognized a pneumatic stretcher 
that lifted him without movement 
or dislocation. He experienced a 
disoriented passage through the air 
past the bright flames, a moment of 
unreal eternity he knew he would 
remember to his death. Then came 
darkness and a voice like Di Irons’ 
was raging loudly and furiously 
about his encirclement by fools and 
villains. 

Then nothing — a long, long 
nothing. He struggled from time to 
time to break through into con- 
sciousness and almost succeeded, 
only to be defeated by something 
circulating in his bloodstream. The 
only thing Ren felt with certainty 
was that he had not died. 

XXIII 

G radually he awoke fully. 

He was in a bed under sheets 
of clinical whiteness. Though' he 
feared to explore his condition, the 
form beneath the fabrics assured 
him he had not lost his legs. The 
room was a curved white cocoon, 
more aseptic and more expensively 
appointed than any hospital room 
of his experience. The bulk of 



smooth equipment at his bedside 
told of the continuous monitoring 
of his condition by medical 
computers. 

A door opened and a tall Ahhn 
nurse began deftly to remove the 
electrodes taped to his wrists and 
chest and forehead. 

“Welcome back to the land of the 
living, Agent Ren. How are you 
feeling?’’ 

In an agony of apprehension Ren 
began to explore himself. A wave of 
immense relief brought an incredu- 
lous smile to his lips. 

“I — I’m still complete?’’ It was a 
statement as much as a question. 

She looked at him sagely. 
“You’ve lost a bit of weight, but 
you’ll soon get that back with 
exercise. You can start getting out 
of bed today.’’ 

“You mean I’m healed?’’ Ren’s 
voice ran high. 

By way of answer she whipped 
the sheeting from the bed and left 
him naked to judge for himself. 
Deep and unfamiliar scars showed 
just how extensive had been the sur- 
gery, yet the flesh was already 
whole and firm and without unfa- 
miliar sensation except for a slight 
tingle at the scar-tissue sites. 

“You were lucky,’’ she said. “No 
great internal complications. Your 
hip bone’s partly plastics now, but I 
doubt if you’d ever have known it if 
you’d not been told.’’ 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



165 




“But — how long have I been 
here?” 

“A little over a month.” She was 
amused at his consternation. 
“You’ve been kept in medicon- 
suspension. The healing rate is 
increased by not having the body 
constantly in conflict with the 
psyche. And with a rest from life of 
that duration, you’ll be amazed at 
how simple your problems have 
become.” 

Ren had heard of the technique of 
this medicon-suspension. Com- 
puter-aided instrumentation would 
have taken over control of his 
subconscious body processes, and 
his brain would have been allowed 
to rest. With the computer- 
enhanced control of his body, a sur- 
geon could promote healing and 
regrowth at rates otherwise not 
possible. His body, too, would not 
have suffered atrophy due to 
prolonged disuse. The method 
came from the forefront of medical 
research on the prime worlds — even 
there it was available only to the 
very few*who could afford it. 

Ren felt good. For the First time 
in his life he felt completely rested 
and able to encounter whatever 
might come with a rational and 
unclouded approach. As the nurse 
had said, it was amazing how 
simple his problems had become. 
He felt as if he were born anew. 

“Where am I?” he asked. He 



knew the answer but wanted confir- 
mation. 

“In Magda, of course.” The 
nurse had a way of speaking which 
reminded him of Zinder. 

He watched her carefully. She 
was an example of pure Ahhn 
stock, yet fully reconciled to the 
levels of an outworld technology. 
The result was impressive. Added 
to her native attributes were a con- 
fidence and a competence which 
foreshadowed a proud and sane 
mastery of the future. Ren caught 
her arm lightly as she reached to 
disconnect equipment and turned 
her wrist towards him to see the 
Madga slave-mark indelibly writ- 
ten in her fine skin. But a greater 
truth was also written there. Dion- 
daizan’s wizardry was a far more 
potent force than magic. 

Now he thought about it, his 
repair and skilled recovery could 
only have been due to the resources 
of the man he had set out that night 
to attack. On all Roget only Dion- 
daizan could conceivably have in- 
stalled such a facility. The notion 
made Ren feel slightly sick with 
himself. Love thine enemy was an 
old creed to which Ren had not 
strongly subscribed. Nurse thine 
enemy back to health with dex- 
terous and expensive skills was a 
modern extension of the idea and 
one that made Ren, the recipient, 
feel very humble indeed. 



166 



IF 




Dion could have left the gates of 
Magda closed and left his enemy to 
die on the cold cobblestones of 
Thirdhill. No one would have 
thought worse of the Imaiz for it. 
Yet some humanitarian instinct 
must have prompted Dion to take 
Ren in and give him a degree -of 
medical attention unobtainable 
elsewhere in this sector of the 
galaxy. By this action Dion had 
revealed his true stature. 

Thanks to the effectiveness of his 
subconscious rehabilitation, Ren 
felt very little discomfort when he 
first attempted to get out of the 
bed. He found his balance lacking, 
but was able to stand and walk 
without much difficulty. Con- 
sidering the extent of the inju- 
ries which had brought him down, 
he knew he had been incredibly 
lucky. 

The Ahhn nurse was patient but 
firm. After a couple of hours of 
tests and exercises she declared 
herself satisfied with his recovery. 

“You may dress in your own 
clothes now, Agent Ren. Later 
Dion-daizan wants to see you.” 

“I wish to see him, too,” said 
Ren. “I owe him a great deal. But 
for being admitted here, I should 
probably have died.” 

She did not contest the 
statement, but busied herself in an 
anteroom dismantling and cleaning 
the equipment. 



*<TTAKE it my attack on 
X Magda was a failure?” 

“Failure!” Her amusement car- 
ried even though he could not see 
her. “You never stood a chance. 
We had a ring of anti-personnel 
mines out there that could have 
destroyed every man you had. And 
we’ve everything here from laser ri- 
fles to high-velocity flame throwers. 
But you had organized a peasants’ 
attack, so Dion followed suit. A few 
things rolled down a hill were all 
that was necessary to contain you. 
Take my advice, Agent Ren, and 
stick to trade. It’ll be a long time 
before there’s a force on Roget able 
to better Dion in a fight of any 
kind.” 

Ren dressed, walked to the 
window and found himself looking 
out from a position high on 
Magda’s edge. The view ran 
straight down the valley that 
divided Firsthill from Secondhill. 
Small ships were passing through 
the shipping lanes to and from the 
great Aprillo river. From this point 
of vantage Ren’s traders eye could 
appreciate the vast potential of An- 
haritte as a landport and as a ga- 
lactic trading center. In his 
imagination he rebuilt the already 
insufficient dock basin and planned 
a city more modern but just as pic- 
turesque and even more colorful on 
Firsthill. 

Almost without knowing it he 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



167 




had begun to identify himself with 
Anharitte and its inhabitants. Local 
idiosyncrasies were becoming a 
secret source of pride to him. It was 
the one place in the universe he 
wanted to think of as home. He 
wondered if Dion-daizan had 
looked from a similar window and 
reached a similar respect for this 
city built on the three hills. 

Ren’s resolution was simple now. 
He was too much in sympathy with 
Dion’s objectives to oppose the 
wizard further. He was determined 
to resign from the company and re- 
main in Anharitte. This need not 
affect his future too much. There 
were freelance trading prospects on 
Roget whose potential had scarcely 
been touched. And if these failed he 
might even seek employment with 
Dion himself. 

His only fear was that the Imaiz 
might not feel disposed to give him 
the opportunity to remain. Ob- 
viously, from the medical care 
which had been lavished on him, 
Dion was not going to exercise his 
rights over the vanquished and have 
him executed. But Ren realized he 
had been a considerable nuisance to 
the Imaiz and he doubted that Dion 
would suffer him to remain on the 
planet. 

“Agent Ren, the Imaiz will see 
you now.” 

The nurse had returned and was 
waiting to escort him. Somehow the 



slave mark on her wrist no longer 
seemed incongruous. He saw it now 
more as a symbol of application 
and dedication. Dedication to 
what? The future, perhaps. But 
training her to such a pitch was no 
ordinary achievement. It was a 
measure of Dion’s genius. Nobody 
had ever acquired skills like hers 
under the coercion of a whip. 

He followed her, hoping to get a 
glimpse of more of Magda’s 
secrets. He was not disappointed. 
In the corridor he passed the doors 
of two more hospital rooms and 
what appeared to be a biomedical 
laboratory, all staffed with Ahhn 
nurses and technicians. The end of 
the corridor brought him back into 
what was recognizable part of the 
old castle. The sudden transition 
from the aseptically clinical to the 
dark medieval was only a foretaste 
of the metamorphoses to come. 

D ION’S hospital had been es- 
tablished high in one of the 
great flanking towers of Magda. 
Ren descended some stairs and 
each level he came to presented to 
him a tantalizing glimpse of some 
different technological microcosm. 
He could hear machine rooms and 
catch occasional snatches of 
electronic noise or the smell of 
chemicals, perhaps from a labora- 
tory. The complexity of pipes and 
power cables accommodated in the 



168 



IF 




stair well emphasized just how cer- 
tainly he had underestimated 
Dion’s potential. Ren was seeing a 
technical and industrial complex 
built in miniature, but having a 
manufacturing Scope probably 
unequaled outside of one of the 
prime worlds. 

As he passed along the lower cor- 
ridors a suspicion grew in Ren’s 
mind. His guide was surely giving 
him a brief tour of selected parts of 
the establishment. He surmised 
that its purpose was to provide him 
with a more realistic idea of what 
he would be facing should he again 
take up arms against the House of 
Magda — it was also a possible 
prelude to his pending interview 
with Dion himself. 

Ren took the lesson to heart and 
found a logical extension. These 
handpicked and educated slaves of 
Magda were the new heirs to 
Anharitte. 

They would be the spearhead of 
a cultural revolution so formidable 
that the slave system, the 
societies — and even Di Irons and 
the City Fathers — were already 
anachronisms. The marvelous thing 
about the whole affair was the 
care that had been taken not to let 
the old institutions know that they 
were already dead. 

The real question at issue was: 
how bloody would Dion-daizan 
allow his revolution to become? 



Knowledge was power, and Dion 
seemed to be a specialist in im- 
parting knowledge. Was he also a 
specialist in controlling this new 
force he had created? At the 
moment he was working with a 
close-knit team and his control of 
the situation was absolute. But 
when a wider dissemination of the 
knowledge came about, as 
inevitably it must, was Dion big 
enough still to hold the reins of 
power? 

If he were not, then what would 
be the cost in terms of loss of life 
and damage to the essential 
character of Anharitte? 

Magda was built with an outer 
ward and an inner one containing 
the great keep. The keep was lower 
but considerably more massive than 
the towers of any of the other 
castles on the three hills. As he 
crossed the inner ward Ren was 
interested to note many signs of 
burning and explosion — these must 
have been the result of his own 
recent activities. In a way he was 
gratified to find that his excursion 
into improvised weaponry had had 
such a powerful result. He has ob- 
viously stood no chance against 
Dion-daizan, but had he attacked 
Di Guaard, for instance, he would 
probably have won. The notion 
amused him and he immediately 
began to feel better about the 
coming interview. 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



169 




On the ground floor of the keep 
he passed through a communica- 
tions center. In it was a powerful 
FTL communicator, many times 
the size of the limited spaceport 
equipment. The FTL set was 
probably capable of making direct 
contact with Terra itself. Suddenly 
it was no mystery to Ren as to what 
had happened to the Ranee ships. 
Direct intervention by the forces of 
the Galactic Federation had stop- 
ped them in midflight. Doubtless 
here was the instrument that had 
broadcast the alarm. 

This consideration placed the ga- 
lactic standing of the Imaiz in a 
new light. Only prime world 
governments could afford to build 
FTL communications equipment 
and these units were leased only to 
those — like space transportation 
companies — who had good claim to 
on-line communication links across 
the distances of space. Dion’s ac- 
quisition of such an instrument as 
this suggested the involvement of 
outworld planetary governments in 
the affairs of Magda. Rather than 
being an adventurer, there was a 
strong implication that Dion- 
daizan was an agent for the Ga- 
lactic Federation itself. 

Ren’s previous misjudgment of 
the situation bad been so absolute 
that he was now incapable of being 
surprised further. Catuul’s attempts 
to disrupt the Imaiz s estates were 



made pathetic by radio-telephone 
links extending widely over provin- 
cial Magda. On-line data links cou- 
pled to a powerful computer 
registered and monitored every 
aspect of the estates’ growing and 
marketing activities. Even the 
farm-stock prices in the capital city 
of Gaillen were automatically 
updated every second. 

Dion’s knowledge of the overall 
picture of Roget’s outspace com- 
merce was also something that 
would have made Ren scream in his 
sleep had he known of it previously. 
All transactions made through the 
spaceport communications ter- 
minal received an immediate 
printout in Magda. There still 
existed an on-line access to all the 
information contained in the 
spaceport data banks. A further 
display of commercial and tech- 
nological prowess was a broad 
screen for viewing ship movements 
on Firstwater — the image of every 
vessel moved across the screen, ac- 
companied by computer-generated 
comment on the origin, destination, 
value and nature of its cargo. 

D ION-DAIZAN’S chambers 
were high up in the keep. Ren 
knocked and was bidden to enter. 
The chamber into which he came 
was large and nearly circular, oc- 
cupying almost the whole area of 
the level of the keep. The walls 



170 



IF 




from ceiling to floor were lined with 
books and broken only by narrow 
windows. Furnishings were sparse 
and consisted mainly of low 
wooden stools and the broad desk 
at which sat the wizard of 
Anharitte. 

“Come in, Agent Ren — be 
seated. They tell me your recovery 
is going well.” 

“Miraculous is the word,” said 
Ren. “I can’t thank you enough. 
But for you and whoever did the 
surgery I would certainly have 
died.” 

“The surgeon, yes — ” Dion’s eyes 
twinkled with humor. “He’s aged 
twenty-two and is a native of An- 
haritte. I bought him as a lad for 
four barrs. His price was cheap be- 
cause he wasn’t strong enough to 
carry wood. Still I think it was I 
who gained the bargain.” 

“You don’t need to spell it out,” 
said Ren, “I was convinced of the 
effectiveness of your policy the first 
day I saw Zinder in the market.” 

“Yet you continued to oppose 
me?” 

“I did. The liberalization of An- 
haritte appeared inconsistent with 
the principles of Freetrade. As an 
agent of the Company I was com- 
mitted to uphold the Freetrade 
principle.” 

Dion-daizan sat back in his chair 
and interleaved his fingers. Clad in 
a simple white gown, he might have 



been the high-priest of a half- 
hundred religions. But the quiet 
certainty in his eyes belonged to no 
fanatic. 

“You’re a man both of per- 
ception and principle,” said Dion. 
“I like that.” He leaned over to a 
communicator on the desk. “Ask 
Director Vestevaal to join us.” 

“The director is here?” 

“Certainly he’s here. He and I 
have been working while you’ve 
been sleeping these several weeks. 
We’ve been hammering out a for- 
mula to solve our mutual 
problems.” 

Magno Vestevaal was in fine 
form. He greeted Ren jubilantly, 
inquired about his injuries, then 
turned back to Dion-daizan. 

“Well, Dion, what do you think 
of him?” 

“Much as before,” said Dion. 
“After all, our dossier on him was 
pretty complete from the moment 
he was assigned to Roget. The only 
thing we missed was his profound 
talent for destruction. Since his 
coming Anharitte has never been 
quite the same.” 

“What’s going on?” demanded 
Ren, looking from the director to 
the Imaiz and back again. 

The director eased himself onto a 
corner of the Imaiz* s desk and 
turned to Ren confidentially. 

“It was the ancient problem, 
Tito. The irresistible force versus 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



171 




the immovable object: Dion’s ir- 
resistible climate of social change 
versus our intractable need for a 
freeport in this sector of the 
galaxy.” 

4 Tm familiar with the problem,” 
said Ren guardedly. “But it doesn’t 
have a solution.” 

“It does, Tito — and I’ve found it. 
A stroke of commercial genius even 
if I say it myself. I’d like you to 
meet a new director of the com- 
pany — Dion-daizan.” 

“A director?” 

‘‘Dion’s now a major shareholder 
in the company and he has been ap- 
pointed director of sector opera- 
tions. Don’t you see the beauty of 
it. What he does with his social 
revolution is no longer our concern. 
Dion himself is now committed to 
the principle of maintaining 
freetrade in Anharitte.” 

Ren felt suddenly bitter. “I can 
see where the company stands to 
gain, but I never thought Dion 
would sell out the Ahhn for 
money — ” He turned to the Imaiz 
accusingly. 

“Peace, Tito!” Dion-daizan held 
up a cautioning hand. “Your emo- 
tions do you credit, but there’s been 
no sell-out. Freedom and Freetrade 
are merely different aspects of the 
same idea of liberty. To assume 
that they’re opposed is a political 
artifice. It’s a fallacy adopted by 
inept governments to secure an in- 



come to which they have no moral 
title. I always intended the 
freetrade principle to apply to An- 
haritte. As I recall, it was you who 
invented the schism.” 

“I?” 

“And think — if I had been 
genuinely opposed to freetrade do 
you suppose I would not have 
removed you as expeditiously as I 
dispatched the Butcher of Turais?” 

“So you think you can integrate 
the two?” asked Ren. Here were 
new possibilities for his mind to ex- 
plore. “On many levels I can see 
how it would work — but there 
could be a few fundamental 
obstacles. For a start I don’t see 
where the societies would fit into 
the pattern.” 

“The societies will have to 
adapt — but then, they’re very good 
at adaptation. They already provide 
a nucleus of social services, which 
happily can be expanded. And in- 
surance is an untapped field on 
Roget. I could almost envy the 
societies their future.” Dion’s air of 
authority was pervasive. He spoke 
as if the future were under his 
control. 

“Who are you?” asked Ren 
suddenly. 

Dion-daizan grinned broadly. 
“The wizard of Anharitte, of 
course.” 

“He’s pulling your leg,” said 
Vestevaal. “He’s a Terran socio- 



172 



IF 




logical engineer provided by the 
Galactic Federation at the request 
of the planetary government of 
Roget. His job is to nurse an 
essentially feudal society through 
five hundred years of technological 
backlog— without its blowing apart 
or losing its identity.” 

Ren considered this in silence for 
a long time, then: “When did you 
find this out. Director?” 
“Unfortunately not till I’d 
returned from Terra with the 
Imaiz’s contract already signed in 
my pocket. Dion actually let me 
conclude the deal before he admit- 
ted that what I was buying would 
have been given freely anyway. In 
short, he’s an even bigger rogue 
than I. It’s a good thing he’s now on 
our side. We didn’t do so well with 
him in opposition.” 

“And where does this place me?” 
asked Ren finally. “With Dion in 
this theater, the company scarcely 
needs an agent here.” 

“My thoughts entirely,” said 
Vestevaal. “In fact I welcomed the 
chance to take you to Freetrade 
Central. I wanted to initiate you 
into the intrigues necessary to 
maintain a seat on the council. 
However, Dion has another 
proposition. He wants you to re- 
main in Anharitte as his personal 
assistant.” 

“On company affairs?” 

“Only partially. He also wants 



you to assist with his program of 
technical and social reforms. It 
seems the reputation you have built 
as Agent Ren, coupled with your 
deep understanding of the Ahhn, 
gives you the unique ability to serve 
as a bridge between the two cul- 
tures. Both sides know and trust 
you — and that’s a valuable asset 
indeed. Take a day or two to think 
it over.” 

“I don’t need a day or two,” said 
Ren. “I had already decided to stay 
in Anharitte. If Dion will have me. 
I’m his man. I’m sorry about your 
plans for me. Director — but I think 
you understand how I feel.” 

“No apology necessary, Tito. A 
few years younger and faced with 
the same choice, I might even have 
made the same decision. Anharitte 
is a place that grows on you. But as 
it is, I’ve chosen to take something 
of Anharitte with me instead.” 

“Something?” 

“I should say say ‘someone.’ It’s 
a sign of the changing times. Dion’s 
manumission bill is going through 
and he’s releasing Zinder from her 
bond. She and I are to be married 
on Terra. Then she’ll work with me 
at Freetrade Central. What do you 
think of that?” 

“With a combination of the two 
of you manipulating the Freetrade 
Council,” said Ren, “I don’t think 
even the merchant worlds will stand 
a chance.” •

HUE AND CRY 



( Continued from page 4 ) 



between science fiction and fantasy 
(both, I feel, are sf) and also says that 
the impossible is not acceptable. I 
wonder what the criteria are for judging 
what is impossible. A definition that 
states that science fiction is not 
concerned with the impossible seems to 
rule out many types of story: the 
various “doomsday syndrome " stories 
such as Stand on Zanzibar — who ever 
heard of mans trying to survive on an 
Earth that had standing room only? 
Taking the A’s in my sf index: Aldiss’ 
Randy’s Syndrome — is that con- 
ceivably possible? More to the point, 
can we possibly consider that Asimov s 
Nightfall could exist in our physical 
universe? 

If you do think so read Asimovs 
essay on the planet of the double sun in 
Fact and Fancy ( Doubleday ). Taking 
the Alpha Centauri binary as his 
example he says that Sun B would re- 
volve about Sun A two billion miles out 
(roughly the orbit of Uranus) and 
seeing that Alpha Centauri B is 430,000 
miles in diameter it should have the ap- 
parent diameter of Jupiter as seen from 
Earth . True, Sun B would be 150 times 
as bright as the full moon, but this is 
still I /3000th as bright as Sun A. Now, 
Nightfall presupposes a world of six 
suns, each of which is a disk (the 
smallest. Beta, is said to be chipped on 
one side). Obviously the suns must be 
crowded into an area of space less than 
two billion miles in radius. This envi- 
ronment certainly doesn’t strike me as 
“rational. ” 

The question of what is possible 
brings up a pet theory of mine. It goes: 

l ) The universe is infinite in extension 
in both time and space. 



2) In an infinite universe everything is 
possible, given natural laws, but who 
knows the sum total of natural laws? 

3) Therefore everything must happen. 

I find myself having to face certain 

problems. If everything must happen — 
what is fiction? And if God is allowed 
for by the totality of natural laws He 
cannot exist on at least one fragment of 
the universe, but must exist on another. 

Cy Chauvin speculated on the pur- 
pose of sf. I think the most generally 
accepted message in the genre is predic- 
tive, while del Rey sees it as presenting 
alternatives. There is a difference, ob- 
viously. I believe Chauvin finally said 
that the medium has no overall purpose 
beyond the presentation of thought- 
provoking ideas and good tales. I must 
agree with that, for it embraces both 
the predictive functions and the 
expression of alternatives of the genre. 

For me sf is an omnibus genre — it in- 
cludes science fiction, science fantasy, 
speculative fiction, speculative fantabu - 
lation, swordandsorcery (one word ) 
and so on. Until someone comes up 
with a term that covers all our genre I 
will differentiate by keeping sf strictly 
different in meaning from Science Fic- 
tion per se.

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

Here is a copy of my letter to Mrs. 
Weiss in reply to her query in If, 
October f 72 . 

“... I read your letter in the October 
issue of If. The story you inquired 



174 



IF 




about is by Fred Saberhagen and is 
called The Long Way Home. It ap- 
peared in Galaxy, Number 86, Volume 
19 , 05, June '61, published by Galaxy 
Publishing Corporation. 

“Your account is inaccurate in one 
respect— the people are not left un- 
disturbed at the end. 

“ You may be interested to know that 
Poul A nderson also wrote a story ( quite 
different ) with this title, published in 
Astounding as a'serial in 1955 (British 
edition). 

“I hope you are successful in ob- 
taining a copy of the story. 

I hope this information is also of use 
to your other readers. Keep up the 
good work!

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

With the current trend of weird, far- 
out science fiction stories it's a rare joy 
to read a good old-fashioned space ad- 
venture such as Gods on Olympus, by 
Stephen Tall (If Oct. '72). His detailed 
buildup of characters and ship with the 
appropriate name of Stardust makes 
me wonder if he might be planning 
more adventures for the crew and ship. 

Currently the only ones who still 
consistently write good sf adventures 
are A. Bertram Chandler and John 
Rackham. 

Chuck Burdett 
Palmdale, California 

Stephen Tall is working on a new 
Stardust novelette — you should be 
seeing it shortly. The Stardust series 
has been running consistently in both 
Galaxy and If 



Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I am very pleased with January '73 
Galaxy. This is the second issue I've 
read after an absence from the field of 
about three years. I remember Galaxy 
as the aristocrat of science fiction 
magazines — it still is. 

If, however, has changed. The stories 
in the December issue were excellent — 
there wasn't one I didn't enjoy. 
However, your feature department is 
small and I miss a good editorial — also 
the If Firsts that used to be marked 
plainly and be accompanied by a brief 
biography of the author. 

Nichola Grimshawe 
Ontario, Canada 

Teratohippus, by Robert L. Davis, 
one of the excellent stories you enjoyed 
in the December issue, was an If First. 
It has enjoyed top reader comment. 
Both If and Galaxy are as active as ever 
in launching new authors — and we do 
mean to launch them. It’s sometimes a 
disservice both to the author and the 
magazine to label a story a “first.” 

We currently have something better 
under discussion for writers who select 
us to publish their best first work — you 
may expect an announcement shortly. 

—JAKOBSSON
