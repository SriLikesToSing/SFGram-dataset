The paper time machine 

STRATEGY & TACTICS is a magazine. It's 
also a tool: a time machine that enables you 
to replay the crucial events -past, present, 
and future — that shape our lives. 

Now, instead of merely reading about what's 
happening, you can explore and experience 
the alternatives and decision points through 
the technique of Conflict Simulation. 

What la Conflict Simulation? 

Conflict Simulation is a way of analyzing a 
political or military conflict situation. A way 
that is as intellectually stimulating as a game 
of chess, and as thorough as a written analysis. 

Through the use of the Conflict Simulation 
(or "game") format, the conflict situation is 
re-created — so that you are in a position to 
make the vital decisions and, in the game at 
least, change the way things were. are. or 
will be. 

What you gat 

STRATEGY&TACTICS magazine is publish- 
ed bi-monthly. Each issue contains: 

*A ready-to-play conflict-simulation game 
with a 22 x 28 playing surface, die-cut play- 



ing pieces, and complete rules. 

* An analytical article on the same subject as 
the game in that issue. 

* Other feature articles on historical and 
military subjects. 

* Game and book reviews, commentary on 
existing games, and discussions of subscribers' 
questions. 

The magazine is 48 + pages long, and all 
material is handled in a highly organized (and 
easily understandable) graphic format. 

Games recently published in STRATEGY & 
TACTICS were: GRUNT (ground combat in 
Vietnam). LOST BATTLES (tactical combat in 
Russia. 1941-44), USN (the war in the Pacific, 
1941-43), COMBAT COMMAND (tactical com- 
bat in Western Europe, 1944). 

We also publish a separate line of conflict- 
simulation games, which you will find listed in 
the coupon.

had been handed a particular 
situation and it was our fate to play 
its permutations out to their con- 
clusion — atomic disaster or Ameri- 
can triumph. We had no choice 
other than these. Like it or lump it. 
Love it or else. 

The protest of the 1960’s was an 
objection to the American Dream 
Machine, but it was doomed to fail. 
When an era has crystalized, al- 
ternatives are unimaginable. Hate 
their two choices as they might, the 
protesters of the Sixties could not 
imagine any others. They still 
believed that their most likely 
futures were nuclear hell or Amer- 
ica stepping on the face of the 
world. 

The imagined universe of science 
fiction during these same years was 
a reflection on the hopes and fears 
of the new era. The great fear was 
Atomic Armageddon. The great 
hope was that the men of Earth 
might stride forth to conquer the 
stars. 

These hopes were first expressed 
in the pages of the Golden Age As- 
tounding in exactly the same period 
of time in which our modern world 
crystalized itself. They were the 
basic assumptions of the superman 
stories of A. E. van Vogt, of the 
Future History stories of Robert 
Heinlein, and of the Foundation 
stories of Isaac Asimov. If no sf 
writers during the past thirty years 
have matched these three in impor- 
tance, it is because Asimov, Hein- 
lein and van Vogt have held the pa- 



tents within which a generation of 
science fiction writers have labored. 

It is the writers of the Campbell 
Astounding who set forth the out- 
line of our future. We would estab- 
lish colonies among the stars. We 
would dominate alien races. We 
would found galactic empires. And 
we would explode through the 
entire universe. The heroes of this 
world to come were technocrats, 
secret agents and team players — 
the analogs of all the bright young 
Americans who expected to rule the 
postwar world. 

By the end of the 1950’s, this sf 
scenario of the future had become 
gray, trivial and unpromising. 
Heroes revealed fatal fallibility. 
The virtues of human rule of the 
universe seemed questionable. 

In the 1%0’s, just as there was 
reaction to the assumptions of 
American life, so was there reaction 
to its science-fictional image. 
Writers sought color. They wrote of 
lost colonies and of the dropouts of 
Galactic Empire. They wrote, too, 
of the exotic landscapes that might 
survive the nuclear firestorm, of 
holocaust as the wellspring of 
magic. But like the political and 
cultural protest movements of the 
time, the science fiction of the 
1%0’s was an evasion rather than a 
true alternative to the mainline 
future that had been set out in the 
Golden Age Astounding. 

W hen an era has crystalized, 
there are no alternatives. This 




can be seen in the stories that J. G. 
Ballard wrote during the 1960’s. 
His inert inner landscapes of the 
imagination are an expression of 
Ballard’s hatred of the postwar uni- 
verse of sterile plastic. But his 
stories offer no alternative to the 
Future History of Heinlein and the 
others. They offer only exaggera- 
tion of sterility, ennui, and death. 

All the abortive revolutions of the 
1960’s failed at the end of the de- 
cade. Rock music heroes discredit- 
ed themselves or died squalidly. 
Weathermen went underground. 
Dissenters were prosecuted in pub- 
lic show trials. The counterculture 
went into seclusion. The American 
Monster won a final victory in the 
election of Richard Nixon, who is 
the living symbol of the postwar era 
and all its assumptions. 

Since 1969, the typical science 
fiction story has been able to en- 
vision little besides disaster. The 
common story of the period is an 
account of final extinction in the 
near future resulting from a willful 
abuse of technology. 

The most successful writer of the 
past few years in science fiction has 
been Barry Malzberg. Malzberg 
has said, in the spirit of these years, 
“Paranoia is science-fiction.” And 
in his stories of insane astronauts, 
Cape Canaveral and Future History 
meet in some ultimate disaster of 
the spirit. 

But science fiction is not inevi- 
tably paranoid. Not all writers have 
succumbed to the fear and loathing 



that result from being trapped by a 
choice between the unsurvivable 
and the unendurable. There have 
been some few stories in these past 
years that see a new and wholly 
different world lying just before us. 

Examples of these new stories are 
R. A. Lafferty’s “When All the 
Lands Pour Out Again” and Fred 
Pohl’s “The Gold at the Starbow’s 
End”; Jack Dann’s “Junction” and 
our own “When the Vertical World 
Turns Horizontal”. Listen to the 
titles of these stories. They are 
portents. They bid farewell to 
yesterday’s tomorrow. 

They speak of the new time that 
we have now entered. For here it is 
1974 and suddenly all our long-held 
assumptions no longer obtain. It is 
a new springtime. 

The old crystal ization that held 
us in thrall has been shattered. We 
have entered a new era. 

For who could have dreamed 
that the American economy of 
abundance would not be plagued 
by scarcity? Who would ever have 
suspected that a crisis in the supply 
of energy would already be trans- 
forming the great American ma- 
chine? Who would have thought 
only a few years ago that the 
political trials of the Nixon Era 
would all fail, every one, and that 
Richard .Nixon would himself be on 
trial? All the discredited young 
men of the Nixon Administration — 
technocrats, secret agents, team 
players — are our former heroes in 
discard.

All is fluid now. The old situa- 
tion, the old era, is no more. The 
new era has not yet become fully 
apparent. 

In a period of fluidity, there are 
opportunities for all those who can 
perceive them. For those who strive 
to cling to the hopes and fears of 
yesterday, the times will be pro- 
foundly disturbing. But for those 
who can grow, these will be times of 
unparalleled adventures. 



R evolutions are now under way 
throughout science — in astron- 
omy, geology, anthropology, arch- 
aeology and psychology. The details 
are unclear, but it is already certain 
that when the revolutions are com- 
plete, we will have completely re- 
vised our ideas about the nature 
and history of the universe, about 
the emergence and evolution of life 
on this earth, about the origins of 
man and the length of his existence, 
about the intellectual abilities and 
achievements of prehistoric man, 
and about the nature and capacities 
of the human mind. 

We are likewise entering a period 
of radical international readjust- 
ments. The bases of world finance 
and of world trade will be rede- 
fined. The arms race will be aban- 
doned as an anachronism. World 
controls on population growth will 
be established. It will be demon- 
strated that the United Nations is 
no longer an instrument of Amer- 
ican foreign policy. The UN will

grow in effectiveness and change in 
function. 

Within fifteen years, we will all 
be living in ways that are presently 
unimaginable to us. All of the 
priorities of American life will be 
altered. There will be new goals in 
education, new styles of life. We 
will become masters of the Amer- 
ican machine rather than cogs 
within it. 

This new season of change might 
be likened to the 1870’s, the decade 
that saw the rise of corporate capi- 
talism and of European imperial- 
ism, the decade that set the crystal 
that was the Early Twentieth Cen- 
tury. It is also like the 1930’s, the 
period of the Depression and the 
New Deal, the time in which 
American values were last rear- 
ranged. 

Science fiction, the ideal reflec- 
tion of the world around us, will 
also change. All our former as- 
sumptions, the assumptions of the 
1940 Astounding, will be abandon- 
ed. We can no longer write seriously 
of Nuclear Cataclysm or of Terran 
Empire. 

We might take note of the fact 
that we are living now in the days 
that were imagined as the be- 
ginning of Future History. That 
future is now, this very moment. 
But when we look about us, we see 
no rolling roads. We see no Slans. 
We see no positronic robots. The 
future of 1940 is now, but it is not 
the world that was dreamed in 
1940. 



The last period in science fiction 
that was like the one we are now 
entering came during the 1930’s. 
Hugo Gernsback had founded 
Amazing Stories in 1926, in the last 
days of the crystalization of the 
1870’s. Amazing reflected that 
world. It was a sister magazine to 
popular science magazines. The 
future it expected was populated by 
young Tom Edisons. Its heaven was 
a utopia of backyard inventions. Its 
hell was devolution, the collapse of 
civilization and return to skin-clad 
barbarism. The other planets of 
our solar system were envisioned as 
being likewise utopic or barbaric. 
Their populations were either just 
like us, or they were monsters with 
a taste for human flesh. This sf 
world was laid down by Jules Verne 
and given its classic expression by 
H. G. Wells. 

After 1930, all was different. 
There were new magazines. After 
the appearance of Astounding in 
1930, sf took on the racier style and 
size of the pulp magazines. It no 
longer seriously pretended to be 
popular science. During the 1930’s, 
the number of science fiction maga- 
zines grew. As late as 1937, there 
were only three. By 1940, there 
were seventeen. 

There were new editors — in par- 
ticular, F. Orlin Tremaine and 
John W. Campbell. With their en- 
couragement, new writers entered 
the field. The assumptions and 
matter of sf changed radically. 
Before 1930, there was “scientific- 



8 



GALAXY 




tion”. After 1930, there was 
“science fiction”. 

Writers such as E. E. Smith, 
John Campbell, Jack Williamson 
and Stanley Weinbaum began pro- 
ducing stories with strange premises 
and stranger conclusions. They 
proved the basis from which Hein- 
lein, van Vogt and Asimov even- 
tually elaborated a new conception 
of the future. With Smith and 
Campbell, we traveled to the stars 
and beyond the bounds of our own 
galaxy. With Williamson, we pene- 
trated new dimensions. The planets 
of our solar system were colonized. 
With Weinbaum, we discovered 
that aliens need be neither manlike 
or monstrous. 

With all this exciting possibility, 
there was no point to writing the 
familiar old-fashioned style of story 
about wearing a sweater and bow- 
tie and living in a utopia of chuff- 
chuffing inventions. It was more 
creative and exciting to imagine be- 
ing an explorer of alien realms, or 
an asteroid miner, or an outlaw of 
the spaceways. 

J ust so, as of this spring-time 
of the mid-Seventies that we are 
entering, will sf once again be made 
wholly new. Just so E. E. Smith’s 
Skylark once went forth to discover 
the universe, so we need to send 
new starships of the imagination 
forth to take account of a new 
world. These ships will not find an 
empty universe to be strip-mined 
and subjugated. Instead, they will 



find a universe filled to the brim 
with the new, rare and different. It 
will contain standards by which to 
measure ourselves — alien races with 
different abilities, some less ad- 
vanced than we, some more ad- 
vanced. This universe will be the 
ideal reflection of the new multiplex 
Earth we are now awakening to. 

The key words of this new time 
are synergy, and ecology, and evo- 
lution. The era will be a time of 
liberation, unfolding, maturation, 
creativity and growth. 

What the actualities that wait 
locked in these words may be, we 
do not yet know. We must discover 
these things for ourselves, and it is 
an exciting prospect. 

The new sf will help us to under- 
stand and direct our new lives in 
the years immediately ahead. It will 
be more popular in appeal than it 
has ever been. It will come in new 
packages. There will be new editors 
and new writers. Sf will excite you 
as it has never excited you in all 
your years within the Great Ameri- 
can Machine. It will amaze, 
astound and delight you as you 
never dreamed possible. It will 
scratch forgotten itches and satisfy 
unrecognized thirsts. It will aid in 
the remaking of your minds and 
your lives. 

It is time to say goodbye to yes- 
terday’s tomorrow and put it out of 
mind. 

Goodbye. Goodbye. 

The goodbyes are now all said. 

A new tomorrow is waiting. ★

Starflight, Inc. was dedicated 
to the search for lebensraum— 
not finding it— just the search. 




BOB SHAW 



I 

T he President was called Eliza- 
beth, and it was thought by 
some that the mere coincidence of 
name had had a profound influence 
on her lifestyle. Certainly, since the 
death of her father, she had made 
Starflight House into something 
that more resembled an historic 
royal court than the headquarters 
of a business enterprise. There was 
a suggestion of Elizabethan ritual, 



of palace intrigue, of privilege and 
precedence about the way she ran 
her trillion-credit empire. And the 
touch of antiquity which annoyed 
Garamond most — although prob- 
ably only because it was the one 
which affected him most — as her 
insistence on personal interviews 
with ship commanders about to 
embark on exploratory missions. 

He leaned on a carved stone 
balustrade and stared with non- 
committal gray eyes at the tiers of 



11 



descending heated gardens that 
reached to the Atlantic Ocean four 
kilometers away. Starflight House 
capped what had once been a 
moderate-sized Icelandic hill. Now 
the original contours were com- 
pletely hidden under a frosting of 
loggias, terraces and pavilions. 
From the air it always put Gara- 
mond in mind of a gigantic vulgar 
cake. He had been waiting almost 
two hours with nothing to do but 
sip pale-green drinks and fight to 
control his dangerous impatience. 
He would have preferred to spend 
the time with his wife and child. 

As a successful flickerwing cap- 
tain Garamond had been in her 
presence several times; his distaste 
for her was well established. It in- 
fluenced his attitude even more 
than did the fact that she was the 
richest person who had ever lived, 
so far above the law that she some- 
times killed out of sheer petulance. 
Was it, he had often wonder, be- 
cause she had the mind of a man 
that she chose to be an unattractive 
woman in an age when cosmetic 
surgery could correct all but the 
grossest physical defects? Were her 
splayed imperfect teeth and pallid 
skin the insignia of her total 
authority? 

As he watched the colored foun- 
tains glitter in the stepped perspec- 
tives below, Garamond remember- 
ed his first visit to Starflight House. 
About to undertake his third mis- 
sion-command, he had still been 
young enough to feel self-conscious 



in the theatrical black uniform. 
The knowledge that he was enter- 
ing that special relationship reput- 
ed to exist between Elizabeth Lind- 
strom and her captains had made 
him taut and apprehensive, keyed 
up to meet any demand on his re- 
sourcefulness. But nobody in Fleet 
Command or Admincom, had 
warned him that Elizabeth gave off 
a sweet, soupy odor which closed 
the throat when one was most 
anxious to speak clearly. 

Nor had his advisors on Star- 
flight House protocol given him a 
single clue that would have helped 
a young man conceal his natural re- 
action to the President. Among his 
confused impressions, the predomi- 
nant one had been of an abnor- 
mally curved spine at the lower end 
of which was slung a round puffy 
abdomen like that of an insect. 
Garamond, frozen to attention, 
had avoided her eyes when he 
nuzzled the satin cushion of gut 
against his knuckles during her 
prolonged formal inspection of his 
appearance. 

Now, as he leaned on the arti- 
ficially weathered balustrade, he 
could recall emerging from that 
first interview with a cool resent- 
ment toward the older captains who 
had told him nothing to prepare 
him properly for personal dealings 
with the President. And yet, when 
his own turn came, he had allowed 
other raw Starflight commanders to 
go unprepared to the same inaugu- 
ration. It had been easy to justify 



12 



GALAXY 




his inaction. He had merely had to 
consider the possible consequences 
of explaining to a new captain that 
the coveted special relationship 
would involve him in exchanging 
looks of secret appreciation with 
Liz Lindstrom when — in the middle 
of a crowded Admincom flight 
briefing — she would hand him a 
scrap of paper upon which she, the 
richest and most powerful human 
being in the universe, had printed a 
childish dirty joke. If the time for 
suicide ever came, Garamond de- 
cided, he would choose an easier 
and pleasanter way . 

“Captain Garamond,” a man 
said from behind him. “The Presi- 
dent sends her compliments.” 

Garamond turned and saw the 
tall, stooped figure of Vice Presi- 
dent Humboldt crossing the terrace 
toward him. Holding Humboldt’s 
hand was a child of about nine, a 
sturdy silver-haired boy dressed in 
pearlized cords. Garamond recog- 
nized him as the President’s son, 
Harald, and nodded silently. The 
boy nodded in return, his eyes flick- 
ering over Garamond’s badges and 
service ribbons. 

“I’m sorry you have been kept 
waiting so long. Captain.” Hum- 
boldt cleared his throat delicately 
to indicate that this was as far as he 
could go toward expressing views 
not those of Elizabeth. “Unfor- 
tunately, the President cannot dis- 
engage from her present commit- 
ment for another two hours. She 
requests that you wait.” 



“Then I’ll wait.” Garamond 
shrugged, and smiled to mask his 
impatience. Too bad. The tachyonic 
reports from the weather stations 
beyond Pluto had predicted that 
the favorable ion-rich tide sweeping 
through the Solar System would 
shortly ebb. He had planned to sail 
on that tide, boost his ship to light- 
speed in a hurry. Now it looked as 
though he would have to labor up 
the long gravity slope from Sol with 
his ship’s electromagnetic wings 
sweeping the vacuum for a meager 
harvest of reaction mass. 

“Yes. You’ll have to wait.” 

“Of course, I could always 
leave — and see the President when 
I get back.” 

H umboldt smiled faintly in ap- 
preciation of the joke and 
glanced down at Harald, making 
sure the boy’s attention was else- 
where before he replied. “That 
would never do. No doubt Liz 
would be so disappointed that she 
would send an intercept-ship to 
bring you back for a special inter- 
view.” 

"Then I won’t put her to that in- 
convenience,” Garamond said. 
They had both been referring to 
Captain Witsch, a headstrong 
youngster who had grown restless 
after waiting two days in Starflight 
House and had taken off quietly 
one night without Elizabeth’s bles- 
sing. It was said that he had been 
brought back in a high-speed inter-

ceptor, and his interview with the 
President must have been special 
indeed; no trace of his body had 
ever been found. Garamond had no 
way of knowing how apocryphal the 
story might be — the Starflight fleet 
which siphoned off Earth’s excess 
population was so huge that its 
rumors and tales were difficult to 
check. But this one was illustrative 
of certain realities. 

“There is a compensation for 
you, Captain.” Humboldt placed 
one of his pink-scrubbed hands on 
Harald’s silver head. “Harald has 
been showing a renewed interest in 
the flickerwing fleet lately. He has 
been asking questions on subjects 
that loosely come under the head- 
ing of spaceflight theory and prac- 
tice. Liz wants you to talk to 
him — ” 

Garamond looked doubtfully at 
the boy, who seemed absorbed in a 
group of metal statues farther 
along the terrace. “Has he any flair 
for mathematics?” 

“He isn’t expected to qualify for 
a master’s papers this afternoon.” 
Humboldt laughed dryly. “Simply 
encourage his interest, Captain. I 
know admirals who would give 
their right arms for such a public 
token of the President’s trust. Now 
1 must return to the boardroom.” 

“You’re leaving me alone with 
him?” 

“Yes — Liz has a high regard for 
you. Captain Garamond.” 

“Well, I’ve looked after children 
before.” Garamond thought of his 



own six-year-old son, who had 
shaken his fist rather than wave 
goodbye. Thus had the youngster 
expressed his sense of loss and re- 
sentment over having a father who 
left him in answer to greater de- 
mands. Better if he had spent these 
four wasted hours healing the boy’s 
tear-bruised eyes. On top of that, 
there were the reports of the ion 
wind failing, fading away to the 
level of spatial background activity, 
while the explorer-captain stood 
uselessly on an ornate terrace and 
played nursemaid to a child prob- 
ably as neurosis-ridden as his 
mother. Trying to smile as the Vice 
President withdrew, Garamond had 
a feeling he was not making a con- 
vincing job of it. 

“So, Harald,” he said, turning to 
the silver-and-pearl boy, “you want 
to ride a flickerwing, do you?” 

Harald examined him coolly. 
“Starflight employees of less than 
Board status usually address me as 
Master Lindstrom.” 

Garamond raised his eyebrows. 
“I’ll tell you something about 
spaceflying, Harald. Up there the 
most minor technician is more im- 
portant than all your Admincom 
executives put together. Do you 
understand that, Harald? Harry?” 
I'm more of a child than he is, 
Garamond thought in amazement. 

Unexpectedly, Harald smiled. 
“I’m not interested in space-fly- 
ing.” 

“But I thought . .” 

“I told them that because they

wanted to hear it. But I don’t have 
to pretend with you, do I?” 

“No, you don’t have to pretend 
with me, son. What are we going to 
do for the next two hours, though?” 
“I’d like to run,” Harald said, 
with a sudden eagerness that in 
Garamond’s mind restored the lad 
to full membership in the brother- 
hood of small boys. 

“You want to run?” Garamond 
managed a genuine smile. “That’s 
a modest ambition.” 

“I’m not allowed to run or climb 
because I might hurt myself. 
Mother has forbidden it, and every- 
body else around here is so afraid of 
her that they hardly let me blink. 
But — ” Harald looked up at Gara- 
mond, triumphantly ingenuous 
“ — you’re a flickerwing com- 
mander.” 

Garamond realized belatedly that 
the boy had been maneuvering him 
into a corner from the second they 
had met, but felt no annoyance. 
“That’s right — I am. Now let’s see 
how quickly you can make it from 
here to those statues and back.” 
“Right.” 

“Well, don’t stand around. Go!” 
Garamond watched with a mixture 
of amusement and concern as 
Harald set off in a lopsided, clop- 
ping run, elbows pumping rapidly. 
He rounded the bronze statues and 
returned to Garamond at the same 
pace, eyes shining like lamps. 
“Again?” 

“As many times as you want.” 
As Harald resumed his inefficient 



expenditure of energy, Garamond 
went back to the stone balustrade 
of the terrace and stared down 
across the gardens. In spite of the 
late afternoon sunshine, the Atlan- 
tic was charcoal gray and tendrils 
of mist from it were wreathing the 
belvederes and waterfalls in sad- 
ness. A lone gull twinkled like a 
star in its distant flight. 

I don't want to go, Garamond 
thought. It’s as simple as that. 

In the early days he had been 
sustained by the conviction that he, 
Vance Garamond, would be the 
one who would find the third world. 
But interstellar flight was almost a 
century old now and man’s empire 
still included only one habitable 
planet apart from Earth. All of 
Garamond’s enthusiasm and certi- 
tude had achieved nothing. If he 
could accept the probability that he 
would never reach a habitable new 
planet, then it would be better to do 
as Aileen wanted — take a commis- 
sion on the shuttle run and be sure 
of some time at home every month. 
Ferrying shiploads of colonists to 
Terranova would be dull surely, but 
safe and convenient. The ion winds 
were fairly predictable along that 
route and the well-established chain 
of weather stations had eliminated 
any chance of being becalmed . 

“Look at me!” 

Garamond turned, for an instant 
was unable to locate Harald, then 
saw him perched dangerously high 
on the shoulders of a statue. The 
boy waved.

“You’d better come down from 
there.” Garamond tried to hide his 
concern. Harald’s demands were 
growing greater; emotional black- 
mailers used the same techniques 
as ordinary criminals. First permis- 
sion to run on the terrace, then the 
right to make risky climbs. This 
could put Garamond in a difficult 
position with the President. Diffi- 
cult? It occurred to Garamond that 
his career would be ended if Harald 
were to so much as sprain an ankle. 

“But I’m a good climber. 
Watch.” Harald threw his leg 
across a patient bronze face and 
reached for the statue’s upraised 
arm. 

“I know you can climb, but don’t 
go any higher till I get there.” 
Garamond began to walk toward 
the statues, moving casually but 
adding inches to each stride by 
thrusting from the back foot. His 
alarm increased. Elizabeth Lind- 
strom, whose title of President was 
derived from her inherited owner- 
ship of the greatest financial em- 
pire ever known, was the most 
powerful person alive. Her son was 
destined to inherit Starflight from 
her, to control all construction of 
starships and all movement be- 
tween Earth and the one other 
world available to man. And he, 
Vance Garamond, an insignificant 
flickerwing captain, had put him- 
self in a position to incur the anger 
of one or the other. 

“Up we go,” Harald called. 

“Don’t!” Garamond broke into 



an undisguised run. “Please, 
don't.” 

He surged forward through ma- 
liciously thick air that seemed to 
congeal around him like resin. 
Harald laughed delightedly and 
scrambled toward the upright 
column of metal that was the 
statue’s arm — but lost his grip and 
tilted backward. 

One foot lodged momentarily in 
the sculpted collar and acted as a 
pivot, turning him upside down. 

Garamond, trapped in a differ- 
ent continuum, saw the event on a 
leisurely timescale, like the slow 
blossoming of a spiral nebula. He 
saw the first fatal millimeter of day- 
light open up between Harald’s 
fingers and the metal construction. 
He saw the boy seemingly hanging 
in the air, then gathering speed in 
the fall. He saw and heard the 
brutal impact with which Harald’s 
head struck the base of the statuary 
group. 

Garamond dropped to his knees 
beside the small body and knew, on 
the instant, that Harald was dead. 
His skull was crushed, driven in- 
ward on the brain. 

“You’re not a good climber,” 
he whispered numbly, accusingly, 
to the immobile face still dewed 
with perspiration. “You’ve killed 
us both. And my family as well.” 

He stood up, looked toward the 
entrance of the main building, pre- 
paring to face the officials and 
domestics who would come run- 
ning.

The terrace remained quiet but 
for the murmur of its fountains. 

High in the stratosphere an in- 
visible aircraft drew a slow, silent 
wake across the sky. Each passing 
second was a massive hammer-blow 
on the anvil of Garamond’s mind, 
and he had been standing perfectly 
still for perhaps a minute before ac- 
cepting that the accident had not 
been noticed by others. 

Breaking out of the stasis, he 
gathered up Harald’s body, marvel- 
ing at its lightness, and carried it to 
a clump of flowering shrubs. The 
dark-green foliage clattered like 
metal foil as he lowered the dead 
child into its concealment. 

Garamond turned his back on 
Starflight House and began to run.

H e had, if he was lucky, about 
one hundred minutes. 

The figure was arrived at by as- 
suming the President had been pre- 
cise when she had told Garamond 
to wait an extra two hours. There 
was a further proviso — that it had 
been her intention to leave her son 
alone with him all that time. With 
the full span of a hundred minutes 
at his disposal, Garamond decided, 
he had a chance; but any one of a 
dozen personal servants had only to 
go looking for Harald, any one of a 
thousand visitors had only to notice 
a bloodstain . 

The numbers in the game of 
death were tumbling behind his

“Brackett’s back and Ballantine’s got 
her!” That’s how Publishers Weekly her- 
alded the return of Leigh Brackett to 
science fiction with THE GINGER STAR, 
her all-new Eric John Stark adventure 
novel. 



Who, you may ask, is Eric John Stark? 
In a word or two, he is one of the all-time 
great swashbuckling heroes in adventure 
fiction. For years, this larger-than-life 
fellow romped through the pages of Planet 
Stories, once ‘the’ magazine of heroic lit- 
erature. When Planet folded, much to the 
dismay of its readers, Stark went into re- 
tirement and Brackett went back to 
writing screenplays. 



With THE GINGER STAR, the first of 
at least four Stark novels, Leigh Brackett 
has returned from a long sabbatical in 
Hollywood [scripts for Rio Bravo, Hatari 
and The Long Goodbye) to her first love, 
science fiction. 



Where was Simon Ashton? That’s what 
Stark has come to the planet Skaith to find 
out. His mentor and long-time Mend has 
disappeared, and Stark must find him — 
r.o matter what the cost. Everyone he 
meets on the exotic planet has heard of the 
strange Dark Man bum another world — 
the man prophecy had predicted would 
come to Skaith — but no one was talking. 
Not the Farers. Not the Woodsmen. Not 
even the Irnanese. All clues lead to the my- 
sterious North — stronghold of the tyran- 
nical Lords Protector! 



“Imaginatively, Brackett is absolutely at 
the top of her genre,” says PW, “filling

this boob as full of marvels, personalities, 
strange customs and hair-raising escapes 
as a Christmas pudding is fall of plums. 
Of Its kind, It’s just delicious.” 

Of course, the proof of this padding will 
be in the reading. But our friends at the 
Science Fiction Bookshop* tell us that one 
out of three customers starts salavatlng the 
instant he/she sees the cover of the book 
posted on the bulletin board. About that 
cover — we have long wanted to entice 
James Steranko into doing covers for us; 
but he’s a busy man, what with writing 
and editing Mediascenf. However, when 
he heard we had Brackett back at the type-

marvelous little store nestled in New York

“The Rubaiyat of Ambrose Begley” was 
such a lovely yarn — David had to find a

eyes as he stepped off the outward 
bound slideway where it reached 
the main reception area. His official 
transport was waiting to take him 
straight to the shuttle terminal at 
North Field, and— in spite of the 
risks associated with the driver 
being in radio contact with Star- 
flight House — that still seemed the 
quickest and most certain way of 
reaching his ship. The vast ice- 
green hall of the concourse was 
crowded with men and women 
coming off their afternoon shifts in 
the surrounding administrative 
buildings. They seemed relaxed 
and happy, bemused by the gener- 
osity of the lingering sunlight. 
Garamond swore inwardly as he 
shouldered through conflicting cur- 
rents and eddies of people, doing 
his best to move quickly without at- 
tracting attention. 

I am a dead man, he kept think- 
ing in detached wonder. No matter 
what I do. no matter how mv luck 
hotels out in the next couple of 
hours. I’m a dead man. And my 
wife is a dead woman. And my son 
is a dead child. Even if the ion tide 
holds strong and Jills my wings, 
we’re all dead — because there's no 
place to hide. There’s only one 
other world, and Elizabeth's ships 
will be waiting there . 

A face turned toward him from 
the crowd, curiously, and Gara- 
mond realized he had made a 
sound. He smiled, recreating him- 
self in his own image of a successful 
flickerwing captain, clothed in the 



18 



GALAXY 




black-and-silver symbolic of star 
oceans — and the face slid away, 
satisfied that it had made a mistake 
in locating the source of the des- 
pairing murmur. Garamond gnaw- 
ed his lip while he recovered the 
remaining distance to his transport. 
It was stacked in one of the 
reserved magazines near the con- 
course. The sharp-eyed middle- 
aged driver saw him approaching, 
had the vehicle brought up to 
ground level by the time Garamond 
reached the silo. 

“Thanks.” Garamond answered 
Ihe man’s salute, grateful for the 
small saving in time, and got inside 
the upholstered shell. 

“I thought you'd be in a hurry, 
sir.” The driver’s eyes stared know- 
ingly at him from the rear-view 
mirror. 

“Oh?” Garamond controlled a 
spasm of unreasonable fear — this 
was not the way his arrest would 
come about. He eyed the back of 
the driver’s neck, which was ruddy, 
deeply creased and had a number 
of long-established blackheads. 

“Yes, sir. All the Starflight com- 
manders are in a hurry to reach the 
Held today. The weather reports 
aren’t good, I hear.” 

Garamond nodded and tried to 
look at ease as the vehicle shot for- 
ward. A barely perceptible whine 
rose from its magnetic engines. “I 
think I’ll catch the tide,” he said 
evenly. “At least, I hope so — my 
family is coming to see me off.” 

The driver’s narrow face showed 



surprise. “I thought you were going 
direct . .” 

"A slight change of plan — we’re 
calling for my wife and son. You 
remember the address?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Good. Get there as quickly as 
you can.” With a casual movement 
Garamond broke the audio connec- 
tion between the vehicle’s two com- 
partments and picked up the near- 
est communicator set. He punched 
in his home code and held the in- 
strument steady with his knees 
while he waited for the screen to 
come to life and show that his call 
had been accepted. Supposing 
Aileen and Chris had gone out? 
The boy had been upset — again 
Garamond remembered him shak- 
ing his fist instead of waving good- 
bye, expressing in the slight change 
of gesture all the emotions that 
racked his small frame — and Aileen 
could have taken him away for an 
afternoon of distraction and ap- 
peasement. If that were the 
case . 

“Vance!” Aileen’s face crystalliz- 
ed in miniature between his hands. 
“I was sure you’d gone. Where are 
you?” 

“I’m on my way home, be there 
in ten minutes.” 

“Back here? But . .” 

“Aileen, something has happen- 
ed. I’m bringing you and Chris to 
the field. Is he there?” 

“He’s out on the patio. But 
Vance, you never let us see you 
off.”

“1 . Garamond hesitated, 
decided it could be better all 
around if his wife were kept in ig- 
norance at this stage. “I’ve changed 
my mind about some things. Now, 
get Chris ready to leave as soon as 1 
reach the house.” 

Aileen raised her shoulders un- 
certainly. “Vance, do you think it’s 
the best thing for him? I mean 
you’ve been away for three hours 
and he’s just begun to get over his 
first reactions — and now you’re 
going to put him through it all 
again.” 

“1 told you something has come 
up.” How many pet dogs, Gara- 
mond asked himself, did I see 
around the Presidential suite this 
afternoon? Five? Six? “I’ll explain 
later.” At what range can a dog 
scent a corpse? Liz's brood of pets 
could be the biggest threat of all. 
"Please gel Chris ready.’’ 

Aileen shook her head slightly. 
“No, Vance. I’m sorry, but I 
don'l . 

"Aileen!" ( laramond deliberately 
allowed an edge of panic to show in 
his voice, using il to penetrate the 
separate universe of normalcy in 
which his wife still existed. “I can't 
explain things now, but you and 
Chris must be ready to come to the 
field with me within the next few 
minutes. Don't argue any more, 
just do what I’m asking.” 

H e broke the connection and 
forced himself to sit back, 
wondering if he had already said 



too much. Communications snoops 
could be monitoring the public 
band. The car was traveling west on 
the main Akranes autolink, accele- 
rating irregularly as it jockeyed for 
position in the traffic. It occurred 
to Garamond that the driver’s per- 
formance was not as good as it had 
been on the way out to Starflight 
House. That could signify lack of 
concentration. On impulse he re- 
connected the vehicle’s intercom. 

“. at his home,” the driver 
was saying. “Expect to reach North 
Field in about twenty minutes.” 
Garamond cleared his throat. 
“What are you doing?” 

“Reporting in, sir.” 

“Why?” 

“Standing orders. All the fleet 
drivers keep Starflight Centradata 
informed about their movements.” 
“What did you tell them?” 
“Sir?” 

“What did you say about move- 
ments?” 

The driver’s shoulders stirred un- 
easily, causing his Starflight sun- 
burst emblems to blink redly with 
reflected light. “I just said you de- 
cided to pick up your family on the 
way to North Field.” 

“Don’t make any further re- 
ports.” 

“Sir?” 

“As a captain in the Starflight 
Exploratory Arm I think I can 
make my way around this part of 
Iceland without a nursemaid.” 
“I’m sorry, but . .’’ 

“Just drive the car.” Garamond

fought to control the unreasoned 
anger he felt against the man in 
front. “And go faster.” 

“Yes, sir.” The creases in the 
driver’s weatherbeaten neck deep- 
ened as he hunched over the wheel. 

Garamond made himself sit with 
closed eyes, motionless except for a 
slight rubbing of his palms against 
his knees which failed completely to 
remove the perspiration. He tried 
to visualize what was happening 
back on the hill. Was the routine of 
Elizabeth’s court proceeding as on 
any other afternoon? Were the 
boards and committees and tri- 
bunals deliberating in the pillared 
halls, the President moving among 
them, complacently deflecting and 
vibrating the webstrands of empire 
with her very presence? Or had 
someone begun to notice Harald’s 
absence? And his own? 

He opened his eyes and gazed 
somberly at the unrolling scenery 
outside the car. The umbra of com- 
mercial buildings that extended for 
several kilometers around Starflight 
House was giving way to the first of 
the company-owned residential de- 
velopments. As an S.E.A. com- 
mander, Garamond had been en- 
titled to one of the “choice” loca- 
tions, which in Starflight usage 
tended to mean closest to Eliza- 
beth’s elevated palace. In quiet mo- 
ments on the bridge of his ship 
Garamond had often thought about 
how the sheer massiveness of her 
power had locally deformed the 
structure of language in exactly the 



same way as a giant sun was able to 
twist space around itself so that 
captive worlds, though believing 
themselves to be traveling in 
straight lines, were held in orbit. In 
the present instance, however, he 
was satisfied with the physics of 
Elizabeth’s gravitation because it 
meant that his home was midway 
between Starflight House and the 
North Field, and he was losing a 
minimum of time in collecting his 
family. 

Even before the vehicle had halt- 
ed outside the pyramidical block of 
apartments, Garamond had the 
door open and was walking quickly 
to the elevator. He stepped out of it 
on the third floor, raced to his own 
door and let himself in. The 
familiar homey surroundings seem- 
ed to crowd in on him, creating a 
new sense of shock at the fact that 
life as he knew it had ended. For a 
moment he felt like a ghost visiting 
scenes to which he was no longer 
relevant. 

“What’s the matter, Vance?” 
Aileen emerged from a bedroom, 
dressed as always in taut and 
colorful silks. Her plump brown- 
skinned face and dark eyes showed 
concern. 

“I’ll explain later.” He put his 
arms around her and held her for a 
moment. “Where’s Chris?” 

“Here I am. Daddy!” The boy 
came running and swarmed up 
Garamond like a small animal, 
clinging with all four limbs. “You 
came back.” 



ORBITSVILLE

“Come on, son — we’re going to 
the field.” Garamond held Chris 
above his head and shook him, imi- 
tating a start-of-vacation gesture, 
then handed the child to his wife. It 
had been the second time within 
the hour that he had picked up a 
light childish boy. “The car’s wait- 
ing for us. You take Chris down to 
it and I’ll follow in a second.” 

“You still haven’t told me what 
this is all about.” 

“Later, later!" Garamond decid- 
ed that if he were stopped before 
the shuttle got off the ground there 
might still be a faint chance for 
Aileen and the boy if she could 
truthfully swear that she had no 
idea of what had been going on. 

He pushed her into the corridor, 
(hen strode back into the apart- 
ment's general storage area hidden 
by a free- Moating screen of vari- 
colored luminosity. It took him 
oidy a lew seconds to open the box 
containing his old target pistol and 
to till an ammunition clip. The 
long barreled saw-handled pistol 
snagged the material of his uniform 
as he thrust it out of sight in his 
jacket. Acutely conscious of the 
weighty bulge under his left arm, 
he ran back through the living 
space. Impulsively he snatched an 
ornament — a solid-gold snail with 
ruby eyes — from a shelf, and went 
out into the corridor. Aileen was 
holding open the elevator door with 
one hand and trying to control 
Chris with the other. 

‘‘Let’s go,” Garamond said 



cheerfully, above the deafening rat- 
chets and escapement of the clock 
behind his eyes. He closed the ele- 
vator door and pressed the down 
button. At ground level Chris dart- 
ed ahead through the long entrance 
hall and scrambled into the waiting 
vehicle. Fortunately there were few 
people about, and none that Gara- 
mond could identify as neighbors. 
The driver gave Aileen a grudging 
salute and held the car door open 
for her. She sat down next to her 
husband in the rear of the vehicle. 
When it had moved off, he manu- 
factured a smile for her. 

She shook her dark head impa- 
tiently. ‘‘Now will you tell me 
what’s happening?” 

“You’re coming to see me off, 
that’s all.” Garamond glanced at 
his son. He was kneeling at the rear 
window, apparently fascinated in 
the receding view. “Chris should 
enjoy it.” 

"You said it was so important!” 

“It’s important for me to spend a 
little extra time with you and 
Chris.” 

Aileen looked baffled. ‘‘What 
did you bring from the apart- 
ment?" 

“Nothing.” Garamond moved 
his left shoulder slightly to conceal 
the bulge. 

“But I can see it.” She leaned 
forward, caught his hand and 
opened the fingers, revealing the 
gold snail. It was a gift he had 
bought Aileen during their honey-

snatched the little ornament be- 
cause it was the symbolical corner- 
stone of their home. Aileen’s eyes 
widened briefly and she turned her 
head away. Garamond wondered 
what his wife’s intuition had told 
her, wondered' how many minutes 
they had left. 



at that moment a minor official 
on the domestic staff of Star- 
flight House was moving uncertain- 
ly through the contrived Italian 
Renaissance atmosphere of the 
carved hill. His name was Carlos 
Pennario, and he was holding leads 
to which were attached two of the 
President’s favorite spaniels. 

The doubts that plagued his 
mind were caused by the curious 
behavior of the dogs coupled with 
certain facts about his conditions of 
employment. Both animals, their 
long ears Happing with excitement, 
were pulling him toward a section 
of the shady terrace that ringed the 
hill just at the executive and Presi- 
dential levels. Pennario, who was 
naturally inquisitive, had never 
seen the spaniels behave in this way 
before and he was tempted to give 
them their heads — but, as a Grade 
4 employee, he was not permitted 
to ascend to the executive levels. In 
normal circumstances such consid- 
erations would not have held him 
back for long, but only two days 
earlier he had fallen afoul of his im- 
mediate boss, a gnomelike Scot 
called Arthur Kemp, and had been 



promised demotion next time he 
made a misstep. 

Pennario held on to the snuffling, 
straining dogs while he gazed to- 
ward a group of statues that shone 
like red gold in the dying sunlight. 
A tall, hard-looking man in the 
black uniform of a flickerwing cap- 
tain had been leaning on the stone 
balustrade near the statues a little 
earlier in the afternoon. The moody 
captain seemed to have departed 
and there was nobody else visible 
on the terrace. Yet the spaniels 
were going crazy trying to get up 
there. It was not an earth-shaking 
-mystery, but to Pennario it repre- 
sented an intriguing diversion from 
the utter boredom of his job. 

He hesitated, scanning the slopes 
above, then allowed the spaniels to 
pull him up the broad shallow steps 
to the terrace, their feet scrabbling 
on the smooth stone. Once on the 
upper level, the dogs headed 
straight for the base on which the 
bronze figures stood, then with low 
whines burrowed into the shrubbery 
beyond. 

Pennario leaned over them, part- 
ed the dark-green leaves with his 
free arm, and looked down into the 
cave-like dimness. 



T hey needed another thirty 
minutes, Garamond decided. If 
the discovery of Harald’s body did 
not take place within that time, he 
and his family would be clear of the 
atmosphere on one of the S.E.A.

shuttles before the alarm could be 
broadcast. They would not be out 
of danger -but the ship lying in polar 
orbit, the Bissendorf, was his own 
private territory, a small enclave in 
which the laws of the Elizabethan 
universe did not hold full sway. Up 
there she could still destroy him, 
and eventually would. However, it 
would be more difficult than on 
Earth where at a word she could 
mobilize thousands of men against 
him. 

“1 need to go to the toilet,” Chris 
announced, turning from the rear 
window with an apologetic expres- 
sion on his round face. He pummel- 
ed his abdomen as if to punish it for 
the intervention. 

“You can wait till we reach the 
field.” Aileen pulled him to her 
knee and enclosed him in smooth 
brown arms. 

A feeling of unreality stole over 
Garamond as he watched his wife 
and son. Both were wearing light- 
weight indoor clothing and, of 
course, had no other belongings 
with them. It was incredible, un- 
thinkable, that dressed as they were 
and so unprepared, they should be 
snatched from their natural am- 
bience of sunlight and warm 
breezes, sheltering walls and quiet 
gardens to be projected into the 
deadliness of the space between the 
stars. The air in the car seemed to 
thin abruptly, forcing Garamond to 
take deep breaths. He gazed at the 
diorama of buildings and foliage 
beyond the car windows, trying to 



plan about his movements for the 
vital next half-hour, but his mind 
refused to work constructively. His 
thoughts lapsed into a fugue, a re- 
cycling of images and shocked sen- 
sory fragments. 

He watched for the hundredth 
time as the fatal milimeters of day- 
light opened between Harald’s sil- 
houette and the uncomprehending 
metal of the statue. And the boy’s 
body had been so light. How could 
a package contain all the bone and 
blood and muscle and organs 
necessary to support life and yet be 
so light? So insubstantial that a fall 
of three or four meters . 

“Look, Dad!” Chris moved with- 
in the organic basketwork of his 
mother’s arms. “There’s the field. 
Can we go onto your shuttle?” 

“I’ll try to arrange it.” Gara- 
mond stared through the wavering 
blur of the North Field’s perimeter 
fence, wondering if he would see 
any signs of unusual activity. 

C arlos pennario allowed the 
shrubs to spring together again. 
For the first time since his youth, 
he crossed himself. 

He backed away from what he 
had seen, dragging the frantic dogs 
with him, and looked around for 
help. There was nobody in sight. 
He was opening his mouth with the 
intention of shouting at the top of 
his voice, of unburdening his dis- 
may on the sleepy air, when several 
thoughts occurred to him. Pennario 
had seen Elizabeth Lindstrom only 



24 



GALAXY 




a few times, and always at a dis- 
tance, but he had heard many 
stories in the staff dormitory. He 
would have given a year’s wages 
rather than be brought before her 
with the news that he had allowed 
one of her spaniels to choke on a 
chicken bone. And now he was al- 
most in the position of having to 
face Elizabeth and describe his part 
in the finding of her son’s corpse. 

Pennario tried to imagine what 
the President might do to the 
bearer of such news before she re- 
gained whatever slight measure of 
self-control she was supposed to 
have . 

Then there was the matter of his 
superior, Arthur Kemp. Pennario 
had no right to be on this terrace in 
the first place. To a man like Kemp 
that one transgression would be 
suggestive, would be proof, of 
others. Of somehow being respon- 
sible for the death of the boy, for 
example. He knew the way Kemp’s 
mind worked. Assuming that Pen- 
nario lived long enough to undergo 
an investigation, Kemp would 
swear to anything to avoid any asso- 
ciation with guilt. 

Awareness that he was in mortal 
danger stimulated Pennario into 
decisive action. He kneeled, gather- 
ed the spaniels into his arms, 
hurried down the steps to the lower 
levels. Shocked and afraid though 
he was, his mind retained those 
qualities that had lifted him suc- 
cessfully from near-starvation in 
Mexico to one of the few places in 



the world where there was air 
enough for a man to breathe. 
Locked away in his memory was a 
comprehensive timetable of Kemp’s 
daily movements in and around 
Starflight House. According to that 
schedule the acidulous little Scot 
would shortly be making his final 
inspection tour of the afternoon. 
The tour usually took him along the 
circular terrace, past the shrubbery 
in which Harald’s body was 
hidden — and how much better it 
would be if Domestic Supervisor 
Kemp should make the fearful dis- 
covery. 

Pennario kept slanting down- 
ward across the hill until he had 
reached the lowest point from 
which he could still see a sector of 
the upper terrace and gauge 
Kemp’s progress along it. He mov- 
ed into the shade of an ivy-covered 
loggia, set the dogs on the ground 
and pretended to be busy adjusting 
their silver collars. The excited ani- 
mals fought to get free, but Pen- 
nario held them firmly in check. 

It was important to him that they 
did not make their predictable dash 
to the terrace until Kemp was in 
exactly the right place to become 
involved with their discovery. Pen- 
nario glanced at his watch. 

“Any minute now, my little 
friends,” he whispered. 

I n contrast to what Garamond 
had feared, the field seemed 
quieter than usual, its broad ex- 
panses of ferrocrete mellowed to 



ORBITSVILLE

the semblance of sand by the flee- 
ing sunlight. Low on the western 
horizon a complexity of small 
Clouds was assembled like a fabu- 
lous army, helmets and crests glow- 
ing with fire. Several vaporous 
banners reached toward the zenith 
in deepening pink. As the car drew 
to a halt Garamond shielded his 
eyes, looked toward his assigned 
take-off point and saw the squat 
outline of the waiting shuttle. The 
door was open, the boarding steps 
in place. The sight filled him with a 
powerful urge to rush to the shuttle, 
get Aileen and Chris on board and 
blast off. There were certain pre- 
flight formalities, however. To take 
off without observing them could 
lead to the wrong sort of radio mes- 
sage being beamed up to the Bis- 
sendorf ahead of him. He pushed a 
heavy lock of hair from his fore- 
head and smiled lor the benefit of 
Aileen and the driver. 

“Some papers to sign in here. 
Then we’ll take the slidewalk out to 
(he shuttle,” he said easily as he 
stepped out of the car. 

“1 thought Chris and I would be 
going up to the observation floor,” 
Aileen replied, not moving from 
her seat. 

“There’s no fun in that, is there, 
Chris?” Garamond lifted the boy 
from Aileen’s knee and set him 
down on the steps of the S.E.A. 
building. ‘‘What’s the point in 
having a Dad who’s a flickerwing 
captain if you can’t get a few extra 
privileges? You’d like to look 



around inside the shuttle, wouldn’t 
you?” 

Chris nodded, but with a curious 
reserve, as if he had sensed some- 
thing of Aileen’s unease. 

“Of course you would.” Gara- 
mond took Aileen’s hand, drew her 
out of the car and slammed the 
door. “That’s all, driver — we can 
look after ourselves from here on.” 
The driver glanced back once, 
without speaking, and accelerated 
away toward the transport pool. 

Aileen caught Garamond’s arm. 
“Vance, we’re alone now. What 
is . .?” 

“Now you two stand right here 
on these steps and don’t move till I 
come out. This won’t take long.” 
Garamond sprinted up the steps, 
returned the salutes of the guards 
at the top, and hurried toward the 
S.E.A. Preflight Center. The large 
square room looked unfamiliar 
when he entered, as though seen 
through the eyes of the young 
Vance Garamond who had been so 
impressed by it at the beginning of 
his first exploratory command. He 
ran to the long desk and slapped 
down his flight authorization docu- 
ments. 

‘‘You’re late, Captain,” com- 
mented a heavily built ex-quarter- 
master called Herschell, who ha- 
bitually addressed outgoing cap- 
tains with a note of rueful challenge 
which was meant to remind them 
he had not always held a desk job. 

“I know — 1 couldn’t get away 
from Liz.” Garamond seized a sty- 



26 



GALAXY 




lus and began scribbling his name 
on various papers as they were fed 
to him. 

“Like that, was it? She couldn’t 
let you go?” 

“That’s the way it was.” 

“Pity. I’d say you’ve missed the 
tide.” Herschell’s pink square face 
was sympathetic. 

“Oh?” 

“Yeah — look at the map.” Her- 
schell pointed up at the vast solid- 
image chart of the solar system and 
the surrounding volume of inter- 
stellar space which floated below 
the domed ceiling. The solar wind, 
represented by yellow radiance, was 
as strong as ever and Garamond 
saw the healthy, bow-shaped shock 
wave on the sunward side of Earth 
where the current impacted on the 
planet’s geomagnetic field. Data on 
the inner spirals of the solar wind, 
however, were of interest only to 
interplanetary travelers — his con- 
cern was with the ion count at the 
edge of the system and beyond. 
Garamond searched for the great 
arc of the shock front near the orbit 
of Uranus. There the solar wind, 
attenuated by distance from Sol, 
built up pressure against the mag- 
netic field of the galaxy. For a 
moment he saw nothing, then his 
eyes picked out an almost invisible 
amber halo, so faint that it would 
have represented nothing more 
than one ion per ten cubic centi- 
meters. He had rarely seen the 
front looking so feeble. It appeared 
that the sun was in a niggardly 



mood, unwilling to assist his ship 
far up the long gravity slope to in- 
terstellar space. 

Garamond shifted his attention 
to the broad, straggling bands of 
green, blue and red that plotted the 
galactic tides of fast-moving cor- 
puscles as they swept across the 
entire chart. These vagrant sprays 
of energetic particles meant as 
much to him as wind, wave and tide 
had to the skipper of a transoceanic 
sailing ship. All spacecraft built by 
Start! ight — which meant all space- 
craft built on Earth — employed in- 
tense magnetic fields to sweep up 
interstellar atomic debris for use as 
reaction mass. The system made it 
possible to conduct deep-space voy- 
ages in ships weighing as little as 
ten thousand tons, as against the 
million tons that would have been 
the minimum for a vessel which 
had to transport its own reaction 
mass. 

Flickerwing ships, however, had 
a disadvantage in that their effi- 
ciency was subject to spatial 
“weather.” The ideal mission pro- 
file was for a ship to accelerate 
steadily to the midpoint of its jour- 
ney and decelerate at the same rate 
for the remainder of the trip; but 
where the harvest of charged par- 
ticles was poor the rate of speed- 
change fell off. If that occurred 
during the first half of a voyage it 
meant the vessel would take longer 
than planned to reach destination. 
If it occurred during the second 
half, the ship would be deprived of 



ORBITSVILLE

the means to discard velocity and 
would storm through its target 
system at unmanageable speed, 
sometimes not coming to a halt 
until it had overshot by light-days. 
It was to minimize such uncertain- 
ties that Starflight maintained 
chains of automatic sensor stations 
whose reports, transmitted by low- 
energy tachyon beams, were con- 
tinuously fed into weather charts. 

And, as Garamond immediately 
saw, the conditions under which he 
hoped to achieve high-speed flight 
were freakishly, damnably bad. 

More than half the volume of 
space covered by the map seemed 
entirely void of corpuscular flux, 
and such fronts as were visible in 
the remainder were fleeing away to 
the galactic south. Only one wisp of 
useful density — possibly the result 
of heavy particles entangling them- 
selves in an irregularity in the inter- 
planetary magnetic field — reached 
as far back as the orbit of Mars, 
and even that was withdrawing at 
speed. 

“I’ve got to get out of here,” 
Garamond said simply. 

Herschell handed him the tra- 
ditional leather briefcase contain- 
ing the flight authorization docu- 
ments^. “Why don’t you take off out 
of it. Captain? The Bissendorf is 
ready to travel, and I can sign the 
rest of this stuff by proxy.” 

“Thanks.” Garamond grabbed 
the briefcase and ran for the door. 

“Don’t let that ole bit of dust get 
away,” Herschell called after him. 



one tlickerwing man to another. 
“Scoop it up good.” 

Garamond sprinted along the en- 
trance hall, relieved at being able to 
respond openly to his growing sense 
of urgency. The sight of ships’ com- 
manders running for the slidewalks 
was quite a common one in the 
S.E.A. Center when the weather 
was breaking. He found Aileen and 
Chris on the front steps, exactly 
where he had left them. Aileen was 
looking tired and worried, and 
holding the boy close to her side. 

“All clear,” he said. He caught 
Aileen by the upper arm and urged 
her toward the slideway tunnel. She 
fell in step with him readily enough 
but he could sense her mounting 
unease. “Let’s go!” 

“Where to, Vance?” She spoke 
quietly, but he understood that she 
was asking him the big question, 
communicating on a treasured per- 
sonal level neither of them would 
ever willingly choose to disrespect. 
He glanced down at Chris. They 
were on the slidewalk now, slanting 
down into the tunnel, and the boy 
seemed fascinated by the softly 
tremoring ride. 

“When I was waiting to see the 
President this afternoon, I was 
asked to take care of young Harald 
Lindstrom for an hour . .” The 
enormity of what he had to say 
stilled the words in his throat. 

“What happened, Vance?” 

“1 ... I didn’t take care of him 
very well. He fell and killed him- 
self.”

“Oh!” The color seeped from 
Aileen’s face. ‘''But how did you get 
away from . .?” 

“Nobody saw him fall. I hid the 
body in some bushes.” 

“And now we’re running?” 

“As fast as we can, sweet.” 
Aileen put her hand on Chris’s 
shoulder. “Do you think Elizabeth 
would . .?” 

“She would. Automatically. In- 
stinctively. There’d be no way for 
her not to.” 

Aileen’s chin puckered as she 
fought to control the muscles 
around her mouth. “Oh, Vance! 
How terrible. Chris and I can’t go 
up there.” 

“You can, and you’re going to.” 
Garamond thrust an arm around 
Aileen and was alarmed when she 
sagged against it with her full 
weight. He pushed his mouth close 
to her ear. “I can’t do this alone. I 
need your help to get Chris free. Or 
she may revenge herself on him — ” 
She straightened with difficulty. 
“I’ll try. Lots of women go to Terra- 
nova, don't they?” 

“That’s better.” Garamond gave 
her an encouraging squeeze and 
wondered if she really believed they 
could go to the other human-in- 
habited Starflight-dominated world 
in the universe. “Aileen, we’re al- 
most at the end of the tunnel. 
When we get up the ramp, pick 
Chris up and walk straight into the 
shuttle with him as if it was a school 
bus. I’ll be right behind you, block- 
ing the view of anybody who 



happens to be watching from the 
tower.” 

“What will the other passengers 
say?” 

“There’ll be nobody else on the 
shuttle apart from the pilots, and 
I’ll talk to them.” 

“But won’t the pilots object when 
they see us on board?” 

“The pilots won’t say a word,” 
Garamond promised, slipping his 
hand inside his jacket. 

j^r starflight house, high on 
£ "V . the sculpted hill, the first man 
had already died. 

Domestic Supervisor Arthur 
Kemp had been planning his eve- 
ning meal when the two spaniels 
bounded past him and darted into 
the shrubbery on the long terrace. 
He paused, eyed them curiously, 
then pushed the screen of foliage 
aside. The light was beginning to 
fail, and Kemp — who came from 
the comparatively uncrowded, un- 
polluted, unravaged north of Scot- 
land — lacked Carlos Pennario’s in- 
stinct concerning matters of violent 
and premature death. He dragged 
Harald’s body into the open, stared 
for a long moment at the black 
deltas of blood that ran from nos- 
trils and ears, and began to scream 
into his wrist communicator. 

Elizabeth Lindstrom was on the 
terrace within two minutes. 

She would not allow anyone to 
touch her son’s remains. As the 
staff could not simply walk away, a 
dense knot of people formed. In its 



ORBITSViLLE 



29 




center Elizabeth set up her court of 
inquiry. Standing over the small 
body, satin-covered abdomen glow- 
ing like a giant pearl, she spoke in a 
controlled manner at first. Only the 
Council members who knew her 
well understood the implications of 
the steadily rising inflections in her 
voice, or of the way she had begun 
to finger a certain ruby ring on her 
right hand. These men, obliged by 
rank to remain close to the Presi- 
dent, nevertheless tried to alter 
their positions subtly so that they 
were shielded by the bodies of other 
men, who in turn senses their peril 
and reacted accordingly. The result 
was that the circle around Eliza- 
beth grew steadily larger and its 
surface tension increased. 

It was into this arena of fear that 
Domestic Supervisor Kemp was 
thrust to give his testimony. He 
answered several of Elizabeth’s 
questions with something ap- 
proaching composure, but his voice 
faltered when — alter he too had 
con firmed Captain Garamond’s 
abrupt departure from the ter- 
race — Elizabeth began pulling out 
her own hair in slow, methodical 
handfuls. For an endless minute 
the soft ripping of her scalp was the 
only sound on the terrace. 

Kemp endured it for as long as 
was humanly possible, then turned 
to run. Elizabeth exploded him 
with a laser burst from her ring. 
She was twisting blindly to hose the 
others with its fading energies when 
her senior physician, risking his 



own life, fired a cloud of sedative 
drugs into the distended veins of 
her neck. The President lost con- 
sciousness almost at once but had 
time to utter three words: 

“Bring me Garamond.” 

Ill 

G aramond crowded into the 
stubby shuttlecraft behind 
Aileen and looked forward. The 
door between the crew and pas- 
senger compartments was open, re- 
vealing the environment of instru- 
ment arrays and controls in which 
the pilots worked. A shoulder of 
each man, decorated with the ubi- 
quitous Starflight symbol, was 
visible on each side of the central 
aisle. Garamond could hear the 
preflight checks being carried out. 
Neither of the pilots looked back. 

“Sit there,” Garamond whisper- 
ed, pointing at a seat screened from 
the pilots’ view by the main bulk- 
head. He put his fingers to his lips 
and winked at Chris, making it into 
a game. The boy nodded tautly, un- 
deceived. Garamond walked back 
to the entrance door and stood in it, 
waving to imaginary figures in the 
slidewalk tunnel, then went for- 
ward to the crew compartment. 

‘‘Take it away. Captain,” he 
said, with the greatest joviality he 
could muster. 

‘‘Yes, sir.” The dark-chinned 
senior pilot glanced over his shoul- 
der. “As soon as Mrs. Garamond 
and your son disembark.”

GALAXY 




Garamond looked around the 
flight deck and found a small tele- 
vision screen showing a picture of 
the passenger compartment, com- 
plete with miniature images of 
Aileen and Chris. He wondered if 
the pilots had been watching it 
closely and how much they might 
have deduced from his actions. 

“My wife and son are coming 
with us,” he said. “Just for the 
ride.” 

“I’m sorry, sir— their names are 
not on my list.” 

“This is a special arrangement 
I’ve just made with the President.” 

“I’ll have to check that with the 
tower.” There was a stubborn set to 
the pilot’s bluish jaw as he reached 
for the communications switch. 

”1 assure you it’s all right.” 
Garamond slid the pistol out of his 
jacket and used its barrel to indi- 
cate the runway ahead. “Now, I 
want you to get all the normal 
clearances in a perfectly normal 
way and then do a maximum- 
energy ascent to my ship. I’m 
familiar with the whole routine and 
I can fly this bug by myself if neces- 
sary, so don’t do any clever stuff 
that would make me shoot you.” 

“I’m not going to get myself 
shot.” The senior pilot shrugged 
and his younger companion nodded 
vigorously. “But how far do you 
think you’re going to get. Cap- 
tain?” 

“Far enough — now take us out of 
here.” Garamond remained stand- 
ing between the two seats. There 



was a subdued thud from the pas- 
senger door as it sealed itself, and 
then the shuttle surged forward. 
While monitoring the crosstalk be- 
tween the pilots and the North 
Field tower Garamond studied the 
computer screen, now displaying 
flight parameters. The Bissendorf 
lay in Polar Band One, the great 
stream of Starflight spacecraft — 
mainly population transfer vessels, 
but with a sprinkling of Exploratory 
Arm ships — that girdled the Earth 
at a height of more than a hundred 
kilometers. Incoming ships were al- 
located parking slots in any of the 
thirty-degree sectors marked by 
twelve space stations, their exact 
placing being determined by the 
amount of maintenance or repair 
they needed. The Bissendorf had 
been scheduled for a major refitting 
lasting three months, and was close 
in to Station 8, which the computer 
showed to be swinging up over the 
Aleutian Islands. A maximum- 
energy rendezvous could be accom- 
plished in about eleven minutes. 

“1 take it you want to catch the 
Bissendorf this time around,” the 
senior pilot said as the shuttle’s 
drive tubes built up thrust and the 
white runway markers began to 
flicker under its nose like tracer 
fire. 

Garamond nodded. “You take it 
right.” 

“It’s going to be rough on your 
wife and boy.” There was an 
unspoken question in the comment. 

“Not as rough as . .” Gara-

mond decided to do the pilots a 
favor by telling them nothing — they 
too would be caught up in Eliza- 
beth’s inquiries. 

“There’s a metallizer aerosol in 
the locker beside you,” the co-pilot 
volunteered, speaking for the first 
time. 

“Thanks.” Garamond found the 
aerosol container and passed it 
back to Aileen. “Spray your clothes 
with this. Do Chris as well.” 

“What’s it for?” Aileen was try- 
ing to sound unconcerned but her 
voice was small and cold. 

“It won’t do your clothes any 
harm, but it piakes them react 
against the restraint field inside the 
ship when you move. It turns them 
into a kind of safety net and also 
stops you floating about when 
you’re in free fall.” Garamond had 
forgotten how little Aileen knew 
about spaceflight or air travel. She 
had never even flown in an ordinary 
jetliner, he recalled. The great age 
of air tourism was long past — if a 
person was lucky enough to live in 
an acceptable part of the Earth he 
tended to stay put. 

“You can use it first,” Aileen 
said. 

“I don’t need it— all space fliers’ 
uniforms are metallized when they 
are made.” Garamond smiled en- 
couragingly. The pilot didn’t know 
how right he was, he thought. This 
is going to be rough on my wife and 
bov. He returned his attention to 
the pilots as the shuttle lifted its 
nose and cleared the ground. As 



soon as the undercarriage had been 
retracted and the craft was aerody- 
namically clean, the drive tubes 
boosted it skyward on a pink flare 
of recombining ions. Garamond, 
standing behind the pilots, was 
pushed against the bulkhead and 
held there by the sustained accele- 
ration. Behind him, Chris began to 
sob. 

“Don’t worry, son,” Garamond 
called. “This won’t last long. We’ll 
soon be . .” 

“North Field to shuttlecraft Sa- 
hara Tango 4299,” a voice crackled 
from the radio. “This is Fleet Com- 
modore Keegan calling. Come in 
please.” 

“Don’t answer that,” Garamond 
ordered. The clock behind his eyes 
had come to an abrupt and sicken- 
ing halt. 

“But that was Keegan himself. 
Are you mixed up in something big, 
Captain?” 

“Big enough.” Garamond hesi- 
tated as the radio repeated its 
message. “Tune that out and get 
me Commander Napier on my 
bridge.” He gave the pilot a micro- 
wave frequency that would bypass 
the Bissendorfs main communica- 
tions room. 

“But . .” 

“Immediately.” He raised the 
pistol against multiple gravities. 
“This has a hair trigger and there’s 
a lot of G-force piling up on my 
finger.” 

“I’m making the call now.” The 
pilot spun a small vernier on the 



32 



GALAXY 




armrest of his chair and in a few 
seconds had established contact. 

“Commander Napier here.” 
Garamond felt a surge of relief as 
he recognized the cautious tones 
Napier always employed when he 
did not know who was on the other 
end of a channel. 

“This is an urgent one, Cliff.” 
Garamond spoke steadily. “Have 
you had any communications about 
me from Starflight House?” 

“Ah . no. Was I supposed 
to?” 

“That doesn’t matter now. Here’s 
a special order I’m asking you to 
obey immediately and without 
question. Do you understand?” 
“Okay, Vance.” Napier sounded 
puzzled, but not suspicious or 
alarmed. 

“I’m on the shuttle and will ren- 
dezvous with you in a few minutes. 
But right now I want you to throw 
the ultimate master switch on the 
external communications system. 
Right now, Cliff!” 

There was a slight pause, during 
which Napier must have been con- 
sidering that what he had been 
asked to do was illegal and that 
under Starflight Regulations he 
was not obliged to obey such an 
order — then the channel went dead. 

Garamond closed his eyes and 
sighed. He knew that Napier had 
also considered their years together 
on the Bissendorf, all the lightyears 
they had covered, all the alien suns, 
all the hostile useless planets. 
Napier had remembered all the 



shared disappointments that had 
studded their quest for lieben- 
sraum. all the bottles of whiskey 
they had killed while in orbit 
around lost, lonely points of light 
both to console themselves and to 
make the next leg of a mission seem 
bearable. 

If Garamond and Aileen and 
Chris had any chance for life it lay 
in the fact that a spaceship was a 
tiny island universe in which Eliza- 
beth’s power was less than abso- 
lute. True, while in Earth orbit a 
ship’s officers were obliged to obey 
any direct order from Starflight 
Admincom; but he had successfully 
blocked the communications chan- 
nels ... A warning chime from the 
shuttle’s computer interrupted 
Garamond’s thoughts. 

“We have some pretty severe 
course and speed corrections com- 
ing up,” the younger pilot said. 
“Do you want to advise your wife?” 

Garamond nodded gratefully. 
The sky in the forward view-panels 
had already turned from deep blue 
to black as the shuttle’s tubes 
hurled it clear of the atmosphere. 
In a maximum-energy ballistic-style 
sortie it was understood that there 
was no time for niceties — the com- 
puter controlling the flight profile 
would subject passengers to as 
much stresses, within programed 
limits, as they could stand. Gara- 
mond edged back until he could see 
Aileen and Chris. 

“Get ready for some rollercoaster 
stuff,” he told them. “Don’t try to 



ORBITSVILLE 



33 




fight the ship or you’ll be sick. Just 
go with it and the restraint field will 
hold you in place.” They nodded in 
unison, eyes fixed on his face, and 
he felt a crushing weight of respon- 
sibility and guilt. He had barely 
finished speaking when a series of 
lateral corrections twisted space out 
of its normal shape, pulling him to 
the left and then upward away from 
the floor. The fierce pressure of the 
bulkhead against his back prevent- 
ed him from being thrown around 
but he guessed that his wife and son 
must have been lifted out of their 
seats. A gasp from Aileen con- 
firmed her distress. 

“It won’t be long now,” he called 
to her. Stars were shining in the 
blackness ahead of the shuttle. 
Superimposed on the random 
points of light was a strip of larger, 
brighter moles, most of which had 
visible irregularities of shape. The 
strip defined Polar Band One, 
glittering like a diamond bracelet. 
At its midpoint Sector Station 8 
flared with yellowish brilliance. 
The two distinct levels of luminos- 
ity, separating man-made objects 
from the background of distant 
suns, created an awareness of 
three-dimensional depth and cos- 
mic scale that Garamond rarely ex- 
perienced when far into a mission. 
He remained with the pilots, braced 
between their seats and the bulk- 
head, while the shuttle drew closer 
to the stream of orbiting space- 
ships, making further corrections 
in speed and direction. By this time 



Starflight Admincom would have 
tried to contact the Bissendorf and 
would probably be taking other 
measures to prevent his escape. 

“There’s your ship,” the senior 
pilot commented, and the note of 
satisfaction in his voice put Gara- 
mond on his guard. “Looks like 
you're a little late. Captain — there’s 
another shuttle already drifting 
into its navel.” 



G aramond, unused to orient- 
ing himself with the cluttered 
traffic of the Polar Band, had to 
search the sky for several seconds 
before he located the Bissendorf. 
He was able to pick out the silvered 
bullet of a shuttle closing in on the 
big ship’s transfer dock. He felt a 
cool prickling on his forehead. It 
was impossible for the other shuttle 
to have made better time on the 
haul up from Earth, but Admin- 
com must have been able to divert 
one already in orbit and instruct it 
to block the Bissendorf s single 
transfer dock. 

“What do you want to do. Cap- 
tain?” The blue-chinned senior 
pilot had begun to enjoy himself. 
“Would you like to hand over that 
gun now?” 

Garamond said, “The other 
shuttle’s making a normal docking 
approach. Get in there before 
him.” 

“It’s too late.” 

Garamond placed the muzzle of 
the pistol against the pilot’s neck. 



34 



GALAXY 




“Ram your nose into that dock, 
sonny.” 

“You’re crazy — but I’ll try.” The 
pilot fixed his eyes on the expand- 
ing shape of the Bissendorf, then 
spun verniers to center his sighting 
crosshairs on the red-limned target 
of the dock, already partially ob- 
scured by the other shuttle. As he 
did so the retro tubes began firing 
computer-controlled bursts that cut 
their forward speed. “I told you it 
was too late.” 

“Override the computer,” Gara- 
mond snapped. “Kill those retros.” 

“Do you want to commit sui- 
cide?” 

“Do you?” Garamond pressed 
the pistol into the other man’s spine 
and watched as he tripped out the 
autocontrol circuits. The images of 
the competing shuttle and the 
docking target expanded in the for- 
ward screen with frightening speed. 

The pilot instinctively cowered in 
his seat. “We’re going to hit the 
other shuttle, for Christ’s sake!” 

“I know,” Garamond said calm- 
ly. “And after we do you’ll have 
about two seconds to get those 
crosshairs back on target. Let’s see 
how good you are.” 

The other shuttle ballooned 
ahead of and slightly above them 
until they were looking right into its 
main driver tubes. There was a 
shuddering clang that Garamond 
felt in his bones, the other shuttle 
vanished, and the vital docking tar- 
get slewed away to one side. 

Events followed in slow motion 



for Garamond. He had time to 
monitor every move as the pilot 
fired emergency corrective jets that 
wrenched the ship’s nose back to 
something approximating its origi- 
nal bearing, time to brace himself 
as retros hammered on the air- 
frame, even time to be grateful for 
the discovery that the pilot was first 
rate. The shuttle speared into the 
Bissendorf s transfer dock at five 
times the maximum permitted 
speed, wedging itself into the in- 
terior arrester rings with a shriek- 
ing impact that deformed its hull. 

Garamond, the only person in 
the shuttle not protected by a seat, 
was driven .forward. What saved 
him from injury was the restraint 
field’s reaction against any violent 
movement of his clothing. He felt 
bursts of induced heat pass through 
the material, at the same time be- 
came aware of a shrill whistling 
sound from the rear. A popping in 
his ears told him that air was es- 
caping from the shuttle into the 
vacuum of the Bissendorf s dock. A 
few seconds later Chris began to 
sob, quietly and steadily. Gara- 
mond crawled aft, kneeled before 
the boy and tried to soothe him. 

“What’s happening, Vance?” 
The brightly colored silk of Aileen’s 
dress was utterly incongruous. 

“Rough docking, that’s all. We 
are losing some air but they’ll be 
pressurizing the dock and . .” He 
hesitated as a warbling note came 
from the shuttle’s address system. 
“They’ve done it — that’s theequali- 



ORBITSVILLE 



35 




zation signal to say we can get out 
now. There’s nothing to worry 
about.” 

“But we’re falling.” 

“We aren’t falling, honey. Well, 
we are — but not downward . .” 
Garamond had no time at that 
moment to introduce his wife to 
celestial mechanics. “I want you 
and Chris to sit right here for a few 
minutes. Okay?” 

He stood up, opened the passen- 
ger door, looked out at a group of 
officers and engineering personnel 
gathered on the docking bay’s main 
platform. Among them was the 
burly figure of Cliff Napier. Gara- 
mond launched himself upward 
from the sill and allowed the slight 
drag of the ship’s restraint field to 
curve his weightless flight on the 
steel platform. There his boots took 
a firm grip. Napier caught his arm 
while the other men were saluting. 

“Are you all right, Vance? That 
was the hairiest docking I ever 
saw.” 

“I’m fine. Explain it later, Cliff. 
Get the engine deck and tell them I 
want immediate full power.” 
“Immediate?” 

“Yes — there’s a streamer of nova 
dust lagging behind the main 
weather front and we’re going to 
catch it. I presume you’ve preset 
the course.” 

“But what about the shuttle?” 
"We’ll have to take it with us, 
and everybody on it.” 

“I see.” Napier raised his wrist 
communicator to his lips and order- 



ed full power. He was a powerfully 
built and bull-necked man with 
hands like the scoops of a steam 
shovel, but there was a brooding 
intelligence in his eyes. “Is this our 
last mission for Starflight?” 

“My last, anyway.” Garamond 
looked around to make sure nobody 
else was within earshot. “I’m in 
deep, Cliff — and I’ve dragged you 
in with me.” 

“It was my decision — I didn’t 
have to pull the plug on communi- 
cations. Are they coming after us?” 
“With every Starflight ship.” 
“They won’t catch us,” Napier 
said confidently as the deck began 
to press up under their feet, signal- 
ing that the Bissendorf was accele- 
rating out of orbit. “We’ll ride that 
wisp of dust up the hill to Uranus, 
and when we’ve caught the tide . 
Well, there’s a year’s supplies on 
board.” 

“Thanks.” The two shook 
hands. The blunt human contact 
comforted Garamond. Yet he won- 
dered how long it would be before 
either of them would refer openly to 
the bitter underlying reality of their 
situation. They were all dressed up 
with a superb ship. But a century of 
exploration by the vast Starflight 
armada had proved one thing. 
There was nowhere to go. 

IV 

T hey were able to put off the de- 
cision for three days. 

During that time there was only 
one direction in which the Bissen- 



36 



GALAXY 




dorf could logically travel — toward 
the galactic south, in pursuit of the 
single vagrant wisp of particles that 
lingered behind the retreating 
weather fronts. They had caught it, 
barely, and the vast insubstantial 
ramjets formed by the ship’s mag- 
netic fields had begun to gather 
power, boosting it toward light- 
speed and beyond. 

It had been the prototypes of 
starships such as the Bissendorf 
which, a century earlier, had all but 
demolished Einsteinian physics. On 
the first tentative flights there had 
been something of the predicted in- 
crease in mass, but no time-dilation 
effect, no impenetrable barrier at 
the speed of light. A new physics 
had been devised — based mainly on 
the work of the Canadian mathe- 
matician, Arthur Arthur — which 
took into account the lately observ- 
ed fact that when a body of appre- 
ciable mass and gravitic field 
reached speeds approaching .20 it 
entered new frames of reference. 
Once a ship crossed the threshold 
velocity it created its own portable 
universe in which different rules 
applied, and it appeared that the 
great universal constant was not the 
speed of light. It was time itself. 

On his earlier missions Gara- 
mond had been grateful that Ein- 
stein’s work had its limitations and 
that time did not slow down for the 
space traveler. He would have had 
no stomach for finding his wife ag- 
ing ten years for his one, or having 
a son who quickly grew older than 



himself. But on this voyage, his last 
for Starflight, with Aileen and 
Christopher aboard, it would have 
resolved many difficulties had he 
been able to trace a vast circle 
across one part of the galaxy and 
return to Earth to find, as promised 
by Einstein, that Elizabeth Lind- 
strom was long dead. Arthurian 
physics had blocked that notional 
escape door, however, and he was 
faced with the question of where to 
go in his year of stolen time. 

His thinking; on the matter was 
influenced by two major considera- 
tions. The first was that he had no 
intention of condemning the 450- 
strong crew of the Bissendorf to a 
slow death in an unknown part of 
the galaxy in a year’s time. The 
ship had to be able to return to 
Earth and therefore his radius of 
action was limited to the distance 
that could be covered in six months. 
Even supposing he traveled in a 
straight line to one preselected 
destination, the six-month limita- 
tion meant he would not reach far 
beyond the volume of space already 
totally explored by Starflight. 
Chances of this one desperate flight 
producing a habitable world on 
which to hide had been microscopic 
to begin with; when modified by the 
distance factor they vanished into 
the realm of fantasy. 

The other major consideration 
was a personal one. Garamond al- 
ready knew where he wanted to go, 
but was having trouble justifying 
the decision. 



ORBITSVILLE

“Cluster 803 is your best bet,” 
Clifford Napier said. He was lean- 
ing back in a simulated leather 
chair in Garamond’s quarters, and 
in his big hand was a glass of 
liqueur whiskey he had not yet 
tasted but was holding up to the 
light to appreciate its color. His 
heavy-lidded brown eyes were in- 
scrutable as he continued with his 
thesis. 

“You can make it with time to 
spare. It’s dense — average distance 
between suns half a light-year — so 
you’d be able to check a minimum 
of eight systems before having to 
pull out. And it’s prime exploration 
territory, Vance. As you know, the 
S.E.A. board recommended that 
803 should be given high priority 
when the next wave is being plan- 
ned.” 

Garamond sipped his own whis- 
key, with its warmth of forgotten 
summers. “It makes sense, all 
right.” The two men sat without 
speaking for a time, listening to the 
faint hum of the ship’s supercon- 
ducting flux pumps. The hum was 
always audible even in the engi- 
neered solitude of the skipper’s 
rooms. 

“It makes sense,” Napier said 
finally, “but you don’t want to go 
there. Right?” 

“Well, maybe it makes too much 
sense. Admincom could predict 
that we’d head for 803 and send a 
hundred ships into the region. A 
thqusand ships.” 

“Think they could catch us?” 



“There’s always that chance,” 
Garamond said. “It’s been proved 
that four flickerwings deploying 
just ahead of another flickerwing, 
and matching velocities with it can 
control it better than its own 
skipper just by deciding how much 
reaction mass to let slip by.” 

Napier shrugged. “All right, 
Vance — where’s your map?” 

"Which map?” 

“The one showing Pengelly’s 
Star. That’s where you want to go, 
isn’t it?” 

Garamond felt a prick of chagrin 
at having his innermost thoughts 
divined so accurately by the other 
man. “My father actually met 
Rufus Pengelly once,” he said de- 
fensively. “Pop told me he’d never 
known a man less capable of trick- 
ery — and if there was one thing my 
father could do it was judge char- 
acter just by . .” He broke off as 
Napier began to laugh. 

“Vance, you don’t need to sell 
the idea to me. We’re not really 
going to find a third world, so it 
doesn’t matter where we head, does 
it?” 

Garamond’s chagrin was replac- 
ed by relief. He went to his desk, 
opened a drawer and took out four 
large photoprints. They appeared 
to depict grayish metallic or stone 
surfaces on which were arranged a 
number of darker spots in a man- 
ner suggestive of star maps. The 
fuzziness of the markings and the 
blotchy texture of the background 
were due to the fact that the prints 



38 



GALAXY 




were computer reconstructions of 
star charts which had been destroy- 
ed by fire. 

A special kind of fire, Garamond 
thought. The one that robbed us of 
a neighbor. 

Sagania had been discovered 
early in the exploratory phase. It 
lay less than a hundred light-years 
from Sol, only a quarter of the 
separation the best statisticians had 
computed as the average for tech- 
nical civilizations throughout the 
galaxy. Even more remarkable was 
the coincidence of timescales. In 
the geological lifespans of Sagania 
and Earth the period during which 
intelligent life developed and 
flourished was analogous to less 
than a second in the lifespan of a 
man. Yet the “second” on one 
planet had overlapped the “second” 
on the other. Saganians and Men 
had coexisted, against all the odds, 
within interstellar hailing distance, 
each able to look into the night sky 
and see the other’s parent sun with- 
out optical aid. Both had developed 
machine-using philosophy to the 
point of tapping of nuclear energy. 
Both had known the outward urge, 
planned the building of starships, 
and — with their sun-beacons trem- 
bling in the blackness like candles 
in far-off windows — it had been in- 
evitable that there would have been 
a meeting. 

Except that one day on Sa- 
gania — at a time when the first 
civilizations were being formed in 
the Valley of the Two Rivers on 



Earth — somebody had made a mis- 
take. It may have been merely a 
politician who overplayed his hand 
or a scientist who dealt the wrong 
cards. But the pay-off had been 
fatal. Sagania lost its atmosphere, 
and its life, in an uncontrolled 
nuclear reaction that surged around 
the planet like a tidal wave of white 
fire. 



archaeologists from Earth, ar- 
£\. riving seven thousand years 
later, had been able to discover 
little about the final phase of Sa- 
ganian civilization. Ironically or 
not, according to one’s point of 
view, the beings who had represent- 
ed the peak of the planet’s culture 
were the ones who had removed 
virtually all trace of their existence. 
It was the older, humbler Saganian 
culture which, protected by the 
crust of centuries, had been un- 
covered by the electronic probes. 
Among the artifacts turned up had 
been fragments of star maps that 
had excited little comment — 
even though a few researchers had 
noticed that some of the bits 
showed a star which did not exist. 

“This is the earliest fragment," 
Garamond said, setting the photo- 
print on a table. He pointed at a 
blurry speck. “And that’s the sun 
we’ve christened Pengelly’s Star. 
Here’s another map, tentatively 
dated five hundred years later, and 
as you see — no Pengelly’s Star. One 
explanation is that between the 



ORBITSVILLE 



39 




times these two maps were drawn 
the star vanished.” 

“Maybe it got left out by mis- 
take,” Napier prompted, aware 
that Garamond wanted to go over 
all the familiar arguments again. 

“That can’t be — because we have 
two later maps covering the same 
region but drawn several centuries 
apart, and they don’t record the 
star either. And a visual check right 
now shows nothing in that region.” 
“Which proves it died.” 

“That’s the obvious explanation. 
A quick but unspectacular flare- 
up — then extinction. Now, here’s 
the fourth map, the one found by 
Dr. Pengelly. As you can see, this 
map shows our star.” 

“Which proves it’s older than 
maps two and three.” 

“Pengelly claims he excavated it 
at the highest level of all, that it’s 
the youngest.” 

“Which proves he was a liar. 
This sort of thing has happened be- 
fore, Vance.” Napier flicked the 
glossy prints with blunt fingers. 
“What about that affair in Crete a 
few hundred years ago? Archaeol- 
ogists are always ...” 

“Trying to win acclaim for them- 
selves. Sure — but Pengelly had no- 
thing to gain by lying about where 
he found the fragment. I personally 
believe it was drawn only decades 
before the Big Burn, well into the 
Saganians’ space-going era.” He 
spoke with the flatness of utter con- 
viction. “You’ll notice that on the 
fourth map the star isn’t repre- 



sented by a simple dot. There are 
traces of a circle around it.” 

Napier shrugged and took the 
first sip of his whiskey. “It was a 
map showing the positions of ex- 
tinct suns.” 

“That’s a possibility. Possibly 
even a probability. But I’m betting 
that Saganian space technology was 
more advanced than we suspect. 
I’m betting that Pengelly’s Star was 
important to them in some way we 
don’t understand. They might have 
found a habitable world there.” 

“It wouldn’t be habitable now. 
Not after its sun has died.” 

“No — but there might be other 
maps, underground installations, 
something.” Garamond suddenly 
heard his own words as though they 
were being spoken by a stranger, 
and he was appalled by the flimsi- 
ness of the logical structure sup- 
posed to support his family’s hopes 
for a future. He glanced reflexively 
at the door leading to the bedroom 
where Aileen and Chris were asleep. 
Napier, perceptive as ever, did not 
reply and for a while the two space- 
men drank in silence. Blocks of 
colored light, created for decorative 
purposes by the same process that 
produced apparently three-dimen- 
sional weather maps, drifted 
through the air of the room in 
random patterns, mingling and 
merging. Their changing reflec- 
tions seemed to animate the gold 
snail on Garamond’s desk. 

“We never found any Saganian 
starships,” Napier said. 



40 



GALAXY 




“Doesn’t mean they didn't have 
them. You’d find their ships any- 
where but in the vicinity of a 
burned-out home world.” There 
was another silence, the lightcubes 
continuing to drift through the 
room like prisms of insubstantial 
gelatin. 

Napier finished his drink and got 
up to refill his glass. ‘‘You’re 
almost making some kind of a case, 
but why did the Exploratory Arm 
never follow it up?” 

“Let’s level with each other,” 
Garamond said. “How many years 
is it since you really believed that 
Starflight wants to find other 
worlds?” 

u j »* 

“They’ve got Terranova, which 
they sell off in hectare lots as if it 
were a Long Island development 
property in the old days. They’ve 
got all the ships, too. Man’s destiny 
is in the stars— just so long as he is 
prepared to sign away half his life 
to Starflight for the ride, and the 
other half for a plot of land. It’s a 
smooth-running system, Cliff, and 
a few cheap new worlds showing up 
would spoil it. That’s why there are 
so few ships, relatively speaking, in 
the S.E.A.” 

“But . .” 

“They’re more subtle than the 
railroad and mining companies in 
the States were when they set up 
their private towns, but the tech- 
nique’s the same. What were you 
trying to say?” 

“I was trying to agree with you.” 



Napier punched his fist through a 
cube of lime-green radiance, which 
floated away unaffected. “Probably 
doesn’t matter a damn where we go 
in this year, so let’s hunt down 
Pengelly’s Star. Have you any idea 
where it ought to be?” 

‘‘Some. Take a look at this 
chart.” As they walked over to the 
universal machine in the corner 
Garamond again felt relief. Na- 
pier’s acquiescence, to Garamond’s 
mind, gave the project a semblance 
of sanity. When he was within 
voice-acceptance range of the ma- 
chine he called up the map it had 
prepared for him. A three-dimen- 
sional star chart appeared in the air 
above the console. One star trailed 
a curving wake of glowing red 
dashes in contrast to the solid green 
lines representing the galactic drift 
of the others. 

“I had no direct data on how far 
Pengelly’s Star was from Sagania,” 
Garamond said. “But the fact that 
we’re interested in it carries the 
implication that it was a Sol-type 
sun. This gives an approximate 
value for its intrinsic luminosity 
and, as the dot representing it on 
the earliest Saganian map was 
about equal in size to other existing 
stars of first magnitude, I was able 
to assign a distance from Sagania.” 

“There’s a lot of assuming and 
assigning going on there,” Napier 
said doubtfully. 

“Not all that much. Anyway, the 
stars throughout the entire region 
share the same proper motion and 



ORBITSVILLE 



41 




speed so, although they’ve all trav- 
eled a long way in seven thousand 
years, we can locate Pengelly’s Star 
on this line with a fair degree of cer- 
tainty.” 

“Certainty, he says. What’s the 
computed journey time? About 
four months?” 

“Less — if there’s the right sort of 
dust blowing around.” 

“It will be,” Napier said in a 
neutral voice. “It’s an ill wind . .” 

Later, when Napier had left to 
get some sleep, Garamond ordered 
the universal machine to convert an 
entire wall of the room into a for- 
ward-looking viewscreen. He sat for 
a long time in a deep chair, his 
drink untouched, staring at the 
stars and thinking about Napier’s 
last remark. Part of the invisible 
galactic winds from which the 
Bissendorf drew its reaction mass 
had been ill winds indeed for some- 
body, sometime, somewhere. Heavy 
particles, driven across the galactic 
wheel by the forces of ancient 
novae, were the richest and most 
sought-after harvest of all. An ex- 
perienced flickerwing man could 
tell when his engine intakes had 
begun to feed on such a cloud just 
by feeling the deck grow more insis- 
tent against his feet. But a sun 
going nova engulfed its planets, 
converting them and everything on 
them to incandescent gas, and at 
each barely perceptible surge of the 
ship Garamond wondered if his en- 
gines were feeding on the ghosts of 
dawn-time civilizations, obliterat- 



ing all their dreams, giving the final 
answer to all their questions. 

He fell asleep sitting at the view- 
screen, on the dark edge of the 
abyss. 



aileen Garamond had been ailing 
nearly a week. 

Part of the trouble was due to 
shock and the subsequent stress of 
being catapulted into a difficult 
environment. The rest traced to a 
circumstance Garamond was sur- 
prised to discover: his wife was far 
more sensitive than he to minute 
changes in acceleration caused by 
the ship crossing weather zones. He 
explained to her that the Bissendorf 
relied largely on interstellar hydro- 
gen for reaction mass, ionizing it by 
continually firing electron beams 
ahead of the ship, then sweeping it 
up with electromagnetic fields that 
guided it through the engine in- 
takes. As the distribution of hydro- 
gen was constant, the ship would 
have had constant acceleration and 
its crew would have enjoyed an un- 
changing apparent gravity had 
there been no other considerations. 
Space, however, was not the qui- 
escent vacuum described by the old 
Earthbound astronomers. Vagrant 
clouds of charged particles from 
a dozen different kinds of sources 
swept through it like winds and 
tides, heavy and energetic, clash- 
ing, deflecting, creating silent 
storms where they met each other 
head-on.

GALAXY 




“On available hydrogen alone 
our best acceleration would be half 
a gravity or less,” Garamond said. 
“That’s why we value the high- 
activity regions and, where pos- 
sible, plot courses that take us 
through them. And that’s why you 
feel occasional changes in your 
weight.” 

Aileen thought for a moment. 
“Couldn’t you vary the efficiency of 
the engines to compensate for those 
changes?” 

“Hey!” Garamond gave a pleas- 
ed laugh. “That’s the normal prac- 
tice on a passenger ship. They run 
at roughly nine-tenths of full power 
and that’s automatically stepped 
up or down as the ship enters poor 
or rich volumes of space. So ship- 
board gravity remains constant. 
But Exploratory Arm ships nor- 
mally keep going full blast. And on 
a trip like this one . .’’Garamond 
fell silent. 

“Go on, Vance.” Aileen sat up in 
the bed, revealing her familiar sun- 
tanned torso. “You can’t take it 
easy when you’re being hunted, is 
that it?” 

“It isn’t so much that we’re being 
hunted — it’s just that to make the 
best use of our time we must move 
as fast as possible.” 

Aileen got out of the bed and 
walked toward where he was seat- 
ed, her nakedness incongruous in 
the functional surroundings of his 
quarters. “There’s no point in our 
going to Terranova, is there? Isn’t 
that what you’re telling me?” 



He leaned his face against the 
warm cushion of her belly. “The 
ship can keep going for about a 
year. After that . .” 

“And we won’t find a new 
planet. One we can live on, I 
mean.” 

“There’s always the chance.” 
“How much of a chance?” 

“It has taken the entire fleet a 
hundred years of searching to find 
one habitable planet. Work it out 
for yourself.” 

“I understand.” Aileen stood 
with him for a moment, abstract- 
edly holding his face against her- 
self, then she turned away with an 
air of purpose. “It’s about time for 
that guided tour of the ship you 
promised Christopher and me.” 
“Are you sure you’re feeling well 
enough?” 

“I’ll get well enough,” she prom- 
ised. 

Garamond suddenly felt happier 
than he had expected to be ever 
again. He nodded and marched 
into the main room where Chris, in 
pajamas, was eating breakfast. As 
soon as the boy had got over his 
unfortunate introduction to space- 
flight on board the shuttle, he had 
adapted quickly and easily to his 
new surroundings. Garamond had 
eased things by putting in little 
time in the Bissendorf s control 
room, allowing Napier and the 
other senior officers to run the ship. 
Now he helped his son to dress. 
Aileen soon joined them, quite self- 
conscious in the dove-gray nurse’s 



ORBITSVILLE 



43 




coverall he had ordered for her 
from the quartermaster. 

“You look fine,” he said before 
she could ask the age-old question. 

Aileen examined herself critically 
in a mirror. “What is wrong with 
my own clothes?” 

“Nothing, if you’re on the rec- 
reation deck, but you must wear 
functional clothing when moving 
about the other sections of the ship. 
There aren’t any other wives on 
board, and I don’t like to rub it 
in.” 

“But you told me a third of the 
crew were women.” 

“That’s right. We have a hun- 
dred-fifty female crew of various 
ages and ranks. On a long trip 
there’s always a lot of coupling go- 
ing on, and occasionally there’s a 
marriage, but no woman is taken 
on for purely biological reasons. 
Everybody has a job to do.” 
“Don’t sound so stuffy, Vance.” 
Aileen looked at her son, then back 
at her husband. “What about 
Christopher? Does everybody know 
why we’re here?” 

“No. I blocked the communica- 
tions channels while we were on the 
shuttle. The one other person on 
board who knows the whole story is 
Cliff Napier — the others can only 
guess I’m in some sort of a jam, but 
they won’t be too concerned about 
it.” Garamond smiled as he re- 
membered the old flickerwingers’ 
joke. “It’s a kind of relativity ef- 
fect — the faster and farther you go, 
the smaller the President gets.” 



“Couldn’t they have heard about 
it on the radio since then?” 

Garamond shook his head em- 
phatically. “It’s impossible to com- 
municate with a flickerwing when 
it’s underway. No signal can get 
through the fields. The crew will 
probably decide I walked out on 
Elizabeth the way a commander 
called Witsch once did. If anything, 
I’ll go up in their estimation.” 

It took more than an hour to tour 
the various sections and levels of 
the Bissendorf. They started with 
the command deck and moving 
“downward” through the various 
administrative, technical and work- 
shop levels. Last came the field 
generating stations, and the pods 
containing the flux pumps and hy- 
drogen fusion plant. At the end of 
the tour Garamond realized, with 
some astonishment, that for a while 
he had managed to forget that he 
and his family were under sentence 
of death. 

oosted by the ion-rich tides of 
space, the ship maintained an 
average acceleration of 13 meters 
per second squared. Punishing 
though this was to the crew, whose 
weight had apparently increased by 
one-third, it was a rate of speed-in- 
crease that would have required 
several months before the Bissen- 
dorf could have reached the speed 
of light under Einsteinian laws. 
After only seven weeks, however, 
the ship had attained a speed of 
fifty million meters a second — the 




44 



GALAXY 




magical threshold figure above 
which Arthurian physics held 
sway — and new phenomena, inex- 
plicable in terms of low-speed sys- 
tems, were observed. To those on 
board acceleration appeared to re- 
main constant, yet the Bissendorf's 
speed increased sharply until, at 
the midpoint of the voyage, only 
twelve days later, it was traveling at 
vast multiples of the speed of light. 
Retardation produced a mirror 
image of the distance- against- time 
graph, and in an elapsed time of 
four months the ship was in the 
computed vicinity of Pengelly's 
Star . 

orry, Vance.” Cliff Napier’s 
Jjheavy-boned face was somber 
as he spoke. “There’s just no sign 
of it. Yamoto says that if we were 
within ten light-years of a black sun 
his instruments couldn’t miss it.” 
“Is he positive?” 

“Absolutely. In fact, according 
to him, there’s less spatial back- 
ground activity than normal.” 

/ am not going to let it happen, 
Garamond thought irrationally. 
Aloud he said, “Let’s go down to 
the observatory — I want to talk to 
Yamoto.” 

“I can put him on your viewer.” 
“No. I want to see him in per- 
son.” Garamond left the central 
command console and nodded to 
Gunther, the second exec, to take 
over. 

This was the moment Garamond 
had been dreading since the Bissen- 



dorfs engines had been shut down 
an hour earlier, making it pos- 
sible — in the absence of the all-de- 
vouring intake fields — to carry out 
radiation checks of the surrounding 
space. The reason he was going to 
the observatory in person was that 
he had a sudden need to move his 
arms and legs, to respond to the 
crushing urgency absent while the 
ship was in flight but now back 
with him again. And he wanted 
some time away from the watchful 
eyes of the bridge personnel. 

“I’m sorry, Vance.” Napier al- 
ways had trouble adjusting to zero- 
gravity conditions and his .massive 
figure swayed precariously as he 
walked in magnetic boots to the 
elevator shaft. 

“You said that before.” 

“I know. I’d begun to believe we 
were on to something, and some- 
how I feel guilty for the way it has 
turned out.” 

“That’s crazy — we always knew 
it was a long shot,” Garamond 
said. You liar, he told himself. You 
didn't believe it was a long shot at 
all. You convinced yourself you’d 
find a signpost to a third world — 
because you couldn 't face the fact 
that you had condemned your wife 
and son to death. 

As the elevator was taking him 
down he thought back, for perhaps 
the thousandth time, to that after- 
noon on the terrace at Starflight 
House. All he had had to do was 
keep an eye on Harald Lindstrom, 
to refuse permission to run, to do 



ORBITSVILLE 



45 




what anybody else would have done 
in the same circumstances. In- 
stead, he had let the boy trick him 
into doing his hardened spacefarer 
bit, then he had allowed himself to 
be pressured, then he had turned 
his back and indulged in day- 
dreams while Harald was climbing, 
then he had been too slow in reach- 
ing the statue while the first fatal 
millimeter of daylight opened up 
between the boy’s fingers and the 
metal construction . and he was 
falling . and falling . falling! 

“Here we are.” Napier opened 
the elevator door, revealing a tun- 
nel-like corridor at the end of which 
was the Bissendorf s astronomical 
observatory. 

“Thanks.” Garamond fought to 
suppress an overwhelming feeling 
of unreality as he walked out of the 
elevator. He saw, as in a dream, the 
white-clad figure of Sammy Ya- 
moto standing at the far end of the 
corridor waving to him. His brain 
was trying in a numbed way to deal 
with (he paradox that moments of 
truth, those instants when reality 
cannot be avoided, always seem un- 
real. And the truth was that his 
wife and child were going to die. 
Because of him. 

“For a man who found nothing,” 
Napier commented, “Sammy Ya- 
moto’s looking pretty excited.” 

Garamond summoned his mind 
back from gray wanderings. 

Yamoto came to meet him, 
plum-colored lips trembling slight- 
ly. “We’ve found something! After 



I spoke to Mister Napier I became 
curious about there being less 
matter per cubic centimeter around 
here than the galactic norm. It’s as 
if the region has been swept by a 
passing sun, yet there is no sun 
around.” 

“What did you find?” 

“I’d already checked out the 
electromagnetic spectrum and knew 
there couldn’t be a sun nearby. But 
I got a crazy impulse and checked 
the gravitic spectrum anyway.” 
Yamoto was a fifty-year-old man 
who had looked on many celestial 
wonders in his lifetime, yet his face 
was the face of a man in shock. 
Garamond felt the first stirrings of 
elation. 

“Go on,” Napier said from be- 
hind him. 

“I found a gravity source of stel- 
lar magnitude less than a tenth of a 
light-year away, so . .” 

“I knew it!” Napier’s voice was 
hoarse. “We’ve found Pengelly’s 
Star.” 

Garamond’s eyes were locked on 
the astronomer’s. “Let Mister Ya- 
moto speak.” 

“So I took some tachyonic read- 
ings to get an approximation of the 
object’s size and surface composi- 
tion, and ... You aren’t going to 
believe this, Mister Garamond.” 

“Try me,” Garamond said. 

“As far as I can tell . .” Ya- 
moto swallowed painfully. “As far 
as I can tell, the object out 
there . .the thing we have discov- 
ered is a spaceship more than three 



46 



GALAXY 




hundred million kilometers in di- 
ameter!” 

V 

I ike everyone else on board the 
j Bissendorf , Garamond spent a 
lot of time at the forward view- 
screens during the long days of 
approach to the sphere. 

He attended many meetings ac- 
companied by Yamoto, who had 
become one of the busiest and most 
sought-after men on the ship. At 
first the Chief Astronomer had 
wanted to take advantage of the 
drive shut-down period to get off a 
tachyonic signal to Earth announc- 
ing his discovery. Garamond dis- 
creetly did not point out his own 
role as prime mover in the find. 
Instead he made Yamoto aware of 
the danger of letting fame-hungry 
professional rivals appear on the 
scene too early, and at the same 
time he insured against risks by 
ordering an immediate engine re- 
start. 

Yamoto went back to work, but 
the curious thing was that even 
after a full week of concentrated 
activity he knew little more about 
the sphere than had been gleaned 
in his first hurried scan. He con- 
firmed that it had a diameter of 
some 320,000,000 kilometers, or 
just over two astronomical units. 
He confirmed that its surface was 
smooth to beyond the limits of reso- 
lution, certainly the equivalent of 
finely machined steel. He confirm- 



ed that the sphere emitted no 
radiation other than on the gravitic 
spectrum, and that analysis of this 
proved it hollow. In that week the 
only new data he produced were 
that the object’s sphericity was 
perfect to within the possible mar- 
gin of error, and that it rotated. 
The question of whether it could be 
a natural rather than an artificial 
object he refused to discuss. 

Garamond turned all these fac- 
tors over in his mind, trying to 
gauge their relevance to his own 
situation. The sphere, whatever its 
nature, no matter what its origins 
might be, was a startling find. The 
fact that it had been indicated on 
an antique Saganian star chart no 
doubt would radically alter the 
accepted views about the dead 
race’s early technological prowess. 
Possibly the whole science of as- 
tronomy would be affected — but 
not the pathetically short futures of 
his wife and child. What had he 
been hoping for? A fading sun that 
still emitted life-giving warmth? An 
Earth-type planet with a vast net- 
work of underground caverns lead- 
ing down into the heat of its core? 
A race of friendly humanoids who 
would say, “Come and live with us 
and we’ll protect your family from 
the President of Starflight?” 

It was in the nature of hope that 
it could survive on such prepos- 
terous fantasies. But only when 
they were confined to the subcon- 
scious, where — as long as they 
existed at all — the emotions could 



ORBITSVILLE 



47 




equate them with genuine prospects 
of survival, enabling the man on 
the scaffold steps to retain his belief 
that something might still turn up 
to save him. Garamond and his 
wife and boy were on the scaffold 
steps, but the fantasies of hope 
were being dissipated by the awful 
presence of the sphere. 

Garamond found that trying to 
comprehend its size produced an 
actual physical pain between his 
temples. The object was big even by 
astronomical standards; if Sol were 
positioned at its center, the Earth’s 
orbit would be within the shell — as- 
suming that the sphere’s outer sur- 
face was a shell. It was so huge that 
at distances which would have re- 
duced Sol to nothing more than a 
bright star, the sphere was clearly 
visible to the unaided eye as a disk 
of blackness against the star clouds 
of the galactic lens. Garamond 
watched it grow and grow on his 
screens until it filled the entire field 
of view with its dark, inconceivable 
bulk — and yet it was still more than 
150, 000, 000 kilometers away. 

Something within him began to 
cringe from the enormous object. 
In the early stages of the approach 
he had nursed the idea that because 
of the smoothness of its surface, it 
had to be an artifact. The notion 
faded when exposed to the mind- 
punishing reality of the sphere’s 
magnitude, because there was no 
way to visualize engineering on that 
scale, to conceive of a technology so, 
far beyond anything mankind could 



dream of achieving. Then, in the 
.final stages of the approach, the 
Bissendorf s sensors delivered as- 
tounding news. 

A planet orbited the sphere. 

There was no optical evidence of 
the planet’s existence. But a study 
of its gravitic emissions showed that 
it was of approximately the same 
diameter and mass as Earth, and 
that its almost-eircular orbit lay 
some 80,000,000 kilometers outside 
the sphere’s surface. Further, dis- 
covery of the planet permitted new 
deductions about the nature of the 
sphere. 

Chief Astronomer Yamoto sent 
Garamond a report stating unequi- 
vocally that it was a thin shell 
enclosing an otherwise normal sun. 

B y the time it had matched ve- 
locities with the hidden star and 
slipped into an equatorial parking 
orbit, the ship was just over two 
thousand kilometers from the sur- 
face of the dark sphere. The range 
was inconvenient for the rocket- 
propelled buggy that would carry 
the exploration party. But the 
Bissendorfha.& never been intended 
for close maneuvering, and Gara- 
mond decided against jockeying in 
closer with the rarely used ion 
tubes. He sat in the central control 
area and watched the stereo image 
of the EVA group as they prepared 
themselves in the muster station. 
Although Garamond knew all the 
men and women of his crew by 
sight if not by name, there was one 



48 



GALAXY 




blond fresh-complexioned young- 
ster he was having trouble identi- 
fying. He pointed at the screen. 

“Cliff, is that one of the shuttle 
crew we shanghaied?” 

“That's right. Joe Braunek. He 
fitted in well,” Napier said. ‘‘I 
think you did him a favor.” 

“Did Tayman select him for this 
mission?” 

“He volunteered. Tayman re- 
ferred back to me and I interviewed 
him in person.” Napier broke off to 
contemplate a memory that appear- 
ed to amuse him. 

“Well?” 

“Says he’s entitled to log the fly- 
ing time because you wrecked his 
shuttle and dumped it.” 

Garamond laughed. “What of 
the other shuttle pilot? The one 
with the blue chin.” 

“Shrapnel? Ah ... he didn’t fit 
in so well. In fact, he’s pretty 
resentful. He wouldn’t sign on as 
crew and I’ve had to keep him 
under surveillance.” 

“Oh? I seem to remember send- 
ing him an apology.” 

“You did. He’s still resentful.” 
“I wonder why?” 

Napier emitted a dry cough. “He 
wasn’t planning to be separated 
from his wife for this length of 
time.” 

“I’m a self-centered bastard — is 
that it, Cliff?” 

“Not at all.” 

“Don’t give me that — I recognize 
that Chopin cough you give every 
time I go off the rails.” Visualizing 



the shuttle pilot, Garamond tried 
to imagine the man in the context 
of a family like his own but found 
the exercise strangely difficult. 
“Shrapnel knows he’ll be away for 
only a year. Why doesn’t he try to 
make the best of it?” 

Napier coughed once more. “The 
EVA group is about ready to go.” 

“Your TB is back again, Cliff. 
What did I say that time?” Gara- 
mond stared hard at his next in 
command. 

Napier took a deep breath, alter- 
ing the slopes of his massive chest 
and shoulders. “You don’t like 
Shrapnel and he doesn’t like you, 
and that amuses me — because you 
are both the same type. If you were 
in his shoes certainly you’d be 
broody and resentful and looking 
for an opportunity to twist things 
back the way you wanted them. He 
even resembles you physically, sort 
of, yet you sit there telling me he’s 
weird.” 

Garamond’s smile was forced. 
Napier and he had long ago dis- 
carded all remnants of formal re- 
lationship so he felt no resentment 
at the other man’s words, but he 
found them disturbing. They had 
implications he did not want to 
examine. He selected the EVA 
group’s intercom frequency and 
listened to the clamorous, overlap- 
ping voices of the men as the buggy 
was sealed and the dock evacuation 
procedure began. 

They were complaining in a 
good-natured way. about the dis- 



ORBITSVILLE 



49 




comfort of the spacesuits normally 
donned only twice a year in practice 
driljs. Or grumbling about the dif- 
ficulty of carrying instrument and 
tool kits in gloved hands. But Gara- 
mond knew they were genuinely 
pleased and excited. Life aboard an 
S.E.A. vessel consisted of routine 
outward journeys, brief pauses 
while it was established by long 
range instruments that the target 
suns had no planets or no usable 
planets, and equally dull returns to 
base. In the Bissendorf s entire 
span of service, this was the first oc- 
casion for men to leave its protec- 
tive hull and venture into alien 
space. And the object of the sortie 
was to make physical contact with 
something outside humanity’s pre- 
vious experience! It was a big mo- 
ment for the little exploratory 
team. Garamond found himself 
wishing he could take part. 

He watched as the outer doors of 
the dock slid aside to reveal a 
blackness unrelieved by stars. At a 
distance of two thousand kilometers 
the sphere not only filled half the 
sky; it was half the sky. The ob- 
served universe was cut into two 
hemispheres — one of them glowing 
with starclouds, the other filled 
with light-absorbent darkness. 
There was no sensation of being 
close to a huge object, rather, all 
felt poised above infinite deeps. 

The restraining rings opened and 
allowed the white-painted buggy to 
jet out clear of the mother ship. Its 
boxy angular outline shrank to in- 



visibility in a few seconds but its 
interior and marker lights remain- 
ed in view for quite a long time as 
the craft moved “downward” from 
the Bissendorf. Garamond stayed 
at central control while the buggy 
descended , watching several screens 
at once as its cameras sent back dif- 
ferent types of information. At a 
height of three hundred meters the 
commander of the buggy, Krae- 
mer, switched on powerful search- 
lights and succeeded in creating a 
grayish patch of illumination on the 
sphere’s surface. 

“Instruments show zero gravity 
at surface,” he reported. 

Garamond cut in on the circuit. 
“Do you want to go on down?” 
“Yes, sir. The surface looks me- 
tallic from here — I’d like to try a 
touchdown with magnetic clamps.” 
“Go ahead.” 

The indistinct grayness expanded 
on the screens until the dang of the 
buggy’s landing gear was heard. 
“No use,” Kraemer said. “We 
just bounced off.” 

“Are you going to let her float?” 
“No, sir. I’m going to go in again 
and maintain some drive pressure. 
That should lock the buggy in place 
against the surface and give us a 
fixed point to work from.” 

“Go ahead, Kraemer.” Gara- 
mond looked at Napier and nodded 
in satisfaction. The two watched as 
the buggy was inched into contact 
with the surface and held there by 
the thrust of its tubes. 

Kraemer’s voice was heard again. 



50 



GALAXY 




“Surface seems to have a reason- 
able index of friction — we aren’t 
slipping around. I think it’s safe to 
go out for samples.” 

“Right.” 



T he buggy’s door slid open. 

Spacesuited figures drifted out 
and formed a small swarm around 
the splayed-out landing gear. Brac- 
ing themselves against the tubular 
legs, the figures went to work on 
the vaguely seen surface of the 
sphere with drills, cutters and 
chemicals. At the end of thirty 
minutes, by which time the team 
operating the valency cutter could 
have sliced through a house-sized 
block of chrome steel, nobody had 
managed even to mark the surface. 
The result was in accordance with 
Garamond’s premonitions. 

“This is a new one on me,” said 
Harmer, the chemist. “We can’t 
make a spectroscopic analysis be- 
cause the stuff refuses to burn. At 
this stage I can’t even say for sure 
that it’s a metal. We’re just wasting 
our time down here.” 

“Tell Kraemer to bring them 
up,” Garamond said to Napier. “Is 
there any point in firing the main 
ionizing gun against it?” 

“None at all,” put in Denise 
Serra, the Chief Physicist. “If a 
valency cutter at a range of one cen- 
timeter achieved nothing there’s no 
point in hosing energy all over it 
from this distance.” 

Garamond nodded. “Okay. Let’s 



pool our ideas. We’ve acquired a 
little more information, although 
most of it is negative, and I’d like to 
have your thoughts on whether the 
sphere is a natural object or an arti- 
fact.” 

“It’s an artifact,” Denise Serra 
said immediately, with characteris- 
tic firmness. “Its sphericity is per- 
fect and the surface is smooth to 
limits of below one micron. Nature 
doesn’t operate that way — at least, 
not on the astronomical scale.” She 
glanced a challenge at Yamoto. 

“I have to agree,” Yamoto said. 
“I can’t conceive of any natural 
mechanism that would produce 
that thing out there. However, that 
doesn’t mean I can see how it was 
constructed by intelligent beings. 
It’s just too much.” He shook his 
head dispiritedly. The haggardness 
of his face showed that he had been 
losing a lot of sleep. 

O’Hagan, the Chief Science Offi- 
cer, who was a stickler for protocol, 
cleared his throat and spoke for the 
first time. “Our difficulties arise 
from the fact that the Bissendorf is 
an exploration vessel and little 
more. The correct procedure now 
would be to send a tachyon signal 
back to Earth and get a properly 
equipped expedition out here.” His 
severe gray gaze held steadily on 
Garamond’s face. 

“That’s outside the scope of the 
present discussion,” Napier said. 

Garamond shook his head. “No, 
it isn’t. Gentlemen, and lady, 
Mister O’Hagan has put into words 



ORBITSVILLE

something that must have been on 
all your minds since the beginning 
of this mission. It can’t have been 
difficult for you to work out for 
yourselves that I’m in trouble with 
Starflight House. In fact, it’s per- 
sonal trouble' with Elizabeth Lind- 
strom — and I think you all know 
what that means. I’m not going to 
give you any more details, simply 
because I don’t want you to be in- 
volved any more than you are at 
present. Perhaps it is enough to say 
that this has to be my last voyage as 
a Starflight commander, and I 
want this year in full.” 

O’Hagan looked pained but held 
his ground doggedly. “I’m sure I’m 
speaking for all the other section 
heads when I say that we feel the 
utmost personal loyalty to you, 
Captain Garamond. Those feelings 
were not affected by the circum- 
stances surrounding the start of 
this voyage. Had it turned out to be 
a normal, uneventful mission I, for 
one, wouldn’t even consider ques- 
tioning its legality. But the fact re- 
mains that we have made the most 
important discovery since Terra- 
nova and Sagania, and I believe it 
should be reported to Earth with- 
out delay.!’ 

“I disagree,” Napier said coldly. 
“Starflight House didn’t direct the 
Bissendorf to this point in space. 
The sphere was discovered because 
Captain Garamond acted indepen- 
dently to check" out a personally 
held theory. We’ll hand it over to 
Starflight, as a bonus they didn’t 



earn, at the end of the mission’s 
scheduled span of one year.” 
O’Hagan gave a humorless smile. 
“I still feel . .” 

Napier jumped to his feet. “What 
do you mean when you say you feel. 
Mister O’Hagan? Don’t you think 
with your brain like the rest of us? 
Does the fact that you feel these 
things turn them into something for 
which you have no personal respon- 
sibility?” 

“That’s enough,” Garamond 
said. 

"I just want O’Hagan to explain 
his choice of words.” 

“I said . .” 

“Gentlemen, I withdraw my re- 
marks,” O’Hagan interrupted, 
staring fixedly at his notepad. “It 
wasn’t my intention to divert the 
discussion from the main topic. 
Now, we seem agreed that the 
sphere is of artificial origin — so 
what is its purpose?” He raised his 
eyes and scanned the assembled of- 
ficers. 

There was a lengthy silence. 
“Defense?” Denise Serra’s round 
face mirrored her doubts. “Is there 
a planet inside?” 

“There might be a planet on the 
far side of the sun that hasn’t 
shown up on our gravitic read- 
ings,” Yamoto said. “But if we had 
the technology to produce that 
sphere, could there be an enemy so 
powerful that we would have to 
cower behind a shield?” 

“Suppose it was a case of ‘Stop 
the galaxy, I want to get off?’ 



52 



GALAXY 




Maybe the builders were pacifists 
and felt the need to hide. They 
made a pretty good job of conceal- 
ing a star.” 

“I hope that isn’t the answer,” 
Yamoto said gloomily. “If technol- 
ogists like that needed to hide . .” 
“This is getting too speculative,” 
Garamond said. “The immediate 
practical question is, does it have 
an entrance? Can we get inside? 
Let’s have your thoughts on that.” 
Yamoto stroked his wispy beard. 
“If there is an entrance, it ought to 
be on the equator so that ships 
could hold their positions over it 
just by going into a parking orbit 
the way we did.” 

“So you suggest doing a circuit of 
the sphere in theequatorial.plane?” 
“Yes — in the direction opposite 
to its rotation. That way we would 
get the advantage of its seventy 
thousand kilometers an hour of 
equatorial rotation and cut down 
on our own G-forces.” 

“That’s decided then,” Gara- 
mond said. “We’ll turn around as 
soon as Kraemer and his team are 
on board. I hope we’ll recognize an 
entrance if we see one.” 

Three duty periods later he was 
asleep beside Aileen when his com- 
municator buzzed him into wake- 
fulness. 

“Garamond here,” he said 
quietly, trying not to disturb his 
wife. 

“Sorry to disturb you, Vance,” 
Napier said, “but I think we’re 
going to reach an entrance to the 



sphere a couple of hours from 
now.” 

“ What? ” Garamond sat upright, 
aware of deceleration forces. “How 
could you tell?” 

“Well, we can’t be certain, but 
it’s the most likely explanation for 
the echoes we’re picking up on the 
long-range radar.” 

“What sort of echoes?” 

“A lot of them, Vance. There’s a 
fleet of about three thousand ships 
in parking orbit, dead ahead of 
us.” 

VI 

T he ships were invisible to the 
naked eye. Yet on the detector 
screens aboard the Bissendorf they 
appeared as a glowing swarm, 
numerous as stars in a dense 
cluster. High-resolution radar, aid- 
ed by other forms of sensory appar- 
atus, revealed them to be of many 
different sizes and shapes, a vast 
and variegated armada poised 
above one point on the enigmatic 
sphere. 

“You could have told me they 
weren’t Starflight ships,” Gara- 
mond said, easing himself into his 
seat in central control, his eyes 
fixed on the forward screens. 

“Sorry, Vance — that didn’t occur 
to me.” Napier handed Garamond 
a bulb of hot coffee. “As soon as I 
saw the lack of standard formations 
I knew they couldn’t be Starflight 
vessels. The silhouettes and esti- 
mated masses produced by the 



ORBITSVILLE 



53 




computers confirmed it. None, of 
the ships in that bunch can be 
identified by type.” 

Second Officer Gunther gave a 
quiet laugh. “That was a pretty 
hairy moment up here.” 

Garamond smiied in sympathy. 
“I guess it was.” 

“Then we realized we were look- 
ing at a collection of hulks.” 
“You’re positive?” 

“There’s no radiation of any 
kind. Those are dead ships, and 
they’ve been that way for a long 
time.” Napier shook his head. 
“This is turning out to be one hell 
of a trip, Vance. First there was the 
sphere itself, and now . We al- 
ways wondered why no Saganian 
starships had ever been found.” 
One hell of a trip, Garamond re- 
peated to himself, his mind trying 
to deal with the magnitude of the 
new discovery and at the same time 
cope with the shocking and unex- 
pected intrusion of something akin 
to hope. He had fled from the 
Earth as an obscure flickerwing 
commander. Now he had the pros- 
pect of returning as the most cele- 
brated explorer since Laker had 
found Terranova and Molyneaux 
had found Sagania. That was 
bound to make things more diffi- 
cult for Elizabeth. 

In practice she was outside the 
law. But even for the President of 
Starflight Incorporated there were 
limits to how far she could go in full 
view of mass television audiences — 
and Garamond was going to be a 



public figure. A rigged trial, with 
witnesses primed to swear Harald’s 
death had been the result of willful 
action, would not be as certain to 
destroy Garamond as before. For 
such a trial would focus the world’s 
attention on him even more firmly, 
might deny Elizabeth the personal 
revenge she had never been known 
to forego. If he and his family were 
to die it would probably have to 
appear accidental. And even the 
most carefully planned accidents 
could be prevented — if not indefin- 
itely, at least for a reasonable 
length of time. The future still 
looked dangerous, but its uncom- 
promising blackness had been al- 
leviated. 

Maintaining its height above the 
surface of the sphere, the Bissen- 
dorf — which had been closing with 
the immense fleet at a combined 
speed of close to two hundred thou- 
sand kilometers an hour — swung 
out of the equatorial plane. It de- 
scribed a wide semicircle around the 
ships and approached them from 
the opposite direction, carefully 
matching velocities until it shared 
approximately the same parking 
orbit. In the latter stages of the 
maneuver, telescopic observations 
by Chief Astronomer Yamoto re- 
vealed that' several of the vessels at 
the center of the swarm were shin- 
ing by reflected light. He deduced 
that a beam of sunlight was being 
emitted from an aperture in the 
surface of the sphere, and reported 
to Garamond accordingly. Shortly 



54 



GALAXY 




afterward the aperture revealed it- 
self in the telescopes as a thin line 
of faint light that gradually opened 
to a narrow ellipse as the Bissen- 
dorf crept closer. 

The big ship’s central command 
gallery took on a crowded appear- 
ance as officers not on duty found 
reasons to stay near the curving 
array of consoles. They were wait- 
ing for the first transmissions from 
the surveillance torpedo that had 
been dispatched toward the space- 
ships illuminated by the column of 
light escaping from Pengelly’s Star. 
An atmosphere of awe and tension 
possessed the Bissendorf. All on 
board were aware that history was 
being made, dwarfing anything 
that had occurred during their pre- 
vious wanderings in the galaxy. 

“I’m not used to such excite- 
ment,” Napier whispered. “Round 
about this stage on a trip I’m 
usually tucked away quietly with a 
bottle of ninety-proof consolation, 
and I almost think I like it better 
that way.” 

“I don’t,” Garamond said firmly. 
“This is changing things for all of 
us.” 

“Hey, skipper — I was kidding. 
Have you tried to work out what the 
prize money ought to be if it turns 
out that those ships can still be 
flown?” 

Garamond chuckled. He had 
finished his third bulb of coffee and 
was bending over to put it in the 
disposal chute. 

Staring at the screens, Napier ex- 



claimed, “Look at that, Vance!” 

A murmur of shock rose from the 
central gallery as Garamond lifted 
his head to look at the first images 
coming from the distant torpedo. 
They were of a large gray ship 
ripped open along its length like a 
gutted fish. Twisted sections of in- 
frastructure were visible inside the 
wound, like entrails. Lesser scars, 
which had not penetrated the hull, 
crisscrossed the remainder of the 
great ovoid’s sunlit side. 

“Something really chopped her 
up, Cliff.” 

“Not as much as the next one!” 

T he images were changing rapid- 
ly as the surveillance torpedo, 
unhampered by any considerations 
of the effects of G-force on human 
tissue, darted toward a second 
ship — half a ship, actually. It had 
been sliced in two, laterally, by 
some unimaginable weapon, ripples 
of metal flowing back from the 
sheared edges. A small vessel, cor- 
responding in size to a lifeboat, 
hung in space near the open cross- 
section, joined to the jagged half of 
the mother ship by cables. 

After the first startled comments, 
silence fell over the control gallery 
as the images of destruction multi- 
plied. An hour passed while the 
torpedo examined all the ships 
touched by the single shaft of sun- 
light, then spiraled outward into 
the darkness to scan others by the 
light of its own flares. It became 
evident that every vessel in the huge 



ORBITSVILLE 



55 




swarm had died violently, cataclys- 
mically, Garamond found the ships 
illuminated dimly by the flares to 
be the most hideous. Their ruptur- 
ed hulls, silent, brooding over 
gashes filled with the black blood of 
shadow, could have been organic 
remains preserved by the chill of 
space, contorted by ancient agonies. 

“A signal has just come up from 
telemetry,” Napier said. “There’s a 
malfunctioning developing in the 
torpedo’s flare circuits. Want an- 
other one sent out?” 

“No. I think we’ve seen enough 
of wrecks for the present. Have the 
torpedo go down for a look through 
the aperture. I’m sure Mister Ya- 
moto would like some readings on 
the sun in there.” Garamond lean- 
ed back in his seat and gazed at 
Napier. “Has it ever struck you as 
odd that we, as representatives of a 
warlike race, don’t carry any arma- 
ment?” 

“The need has never come up. 
Besides, it’s my guess the Lind- 
stroms don’t want their ships de- 
stroying each other — or combining 
in a revolt against the corpora- 
tions.” He added, “In a pinch, our 
main ionizing beam could do plenty 
of damage.” 

“Not in that class.” Garamond 
nodded at the viewscreens. “We 
couldn’t even aim it without turn- 
ing the whole ship.” 

‘‘You think those hulls prove 
Serra’s theory about the sphere 
being a defense?” 

“Maybe.” Garamond’s voice was 



thoughtful. “We don’t know for 
sure until we have a look inside the 
sphere and see if there is — or was — 
something worth defending.” 
‘‘What makes you think you 
would see anything?” 

“That.” Garamond pointed at 
the screen. It had just begun to 
show new images being transmitted 
back from the torpedo. The aper- 
ture in the dark surface of the 
sphere was circular and almost a 
kilometer in diameter. A yellow 
Sol-type sun hung below it, per- 
fectly centered by the torpedo’s 
aiming mechanisms. The most re- 
markable thing was that the space 
inside the sphere did not appear 
black, as the watchers on the Bis- 
sendorf knew it ought to. It was as 
blue as the summer skies of Earth. 

Two hours later, and against all 
the regulations concerning the 
safety of Starflight commanders, 
Garamond was at the head of a 
small expedition entering the 
sphere. The buggy was positioned 
almost on the edge of the aperture, 
held in place against the surface by 
the thrust of its tubes. Garamond 
was able to grip the strut of a land- 
ing leg with one hand and slide the 
other over the edge of the aperture. 
Its hard rim was only a few centi- 
meters thick. There was a spongy 
resistance to the passage of his 
hand, which told of a force field 
spanning the aperture like a dia- 
phragm, then his gloved fingers 
gripped something that felt like 
grass. He pulled himself through to 



56 



GALAXY 




the inside of the sphere and stood 
up. 

And there — on the edge of a cir- 
cular black lake of stars, suited and 
armored to withstand the lethal 
vacuum of interplanetary space — 
Garamond had his first look at the 
green and infinite meadows of 
Orbitsville. 

VII 

G aramond ' s sense of disloca- 
tion was almost complete. 

He received an impression of 
grasslands and low hills running on 
forever. And although his mind was 
numbed, his thoughts contained an 
element of immediate acceptance, 
as if an event for which he had been 
preparing all his life had finally 
occurred. Garamond felt as though 
he had been born again. In that 
first moment, when his vision was 
swamped by the brilliance of the 
impossible landscape, he was able 
to look at the circular lake of black- 
ness from which he had emerged 
and see it through alien eyes. The 
grass— the tall, lush grass that grew 
right to the rim! — shimmered 
green. It was difficult to accept that 
there were stars down in that pool. 
It was impossible to comprehend 
that were he to lie at its edge and 
look he would see sunken ships 
drifting in black crystal space . 

Something was emerging from 
the lake. Something white, groping 
blindly upward. 

Garamond’s identity returned to 
him abruptly as he recognized the 



spacesuited figure of Lieutenant 
Kraemer struggling to an upright 
position. He moved to help the 
other man and became aware of yet 
another “impossibility” — there was 
gravity sufficient to give him almost 
his normal Earth weight. Kraemer 
and he leaned against each other 
like drunken men, bemused, stun- 
ned, helpless because there were 
blue skies where there should have 
been only the hostile blackness of 
space, because they had stepped 
through the looking glass into a 
secret garden. The grass moved 
gently, reminding Garamond of 
perhaps the greatest miracle of all, 
of the presence of an atmosphere. 
He felt an insane but powerful urge 
to open his helmet, and was fight- 
ing it when his tear-blurred eyes 
focused on — yes — buildings. 

They were visible at several points 
around the rim of the aperture: 
ancient buildings, low and ruinous. 
The reason they had not registered 
immediately on Garamond was 
that time had robbed them of the 
appearance of artifacts, clothing 
the shattered walls with moss and 
climbing grasses. As he began to 
orient himself within the new 
reality, and the images being trans- 
mitted from eyes to brain became 
susceptible to interpretation, he 
saw amid the ruins the skeletons of 
what had once been great ma- 
chines. 

‘‘Look over there,” he said. 
“What do you think?” 

There was no reply from Krae- 



ORBITSVILLE 



57 




mer. Garamond glanced at his 
companion, saw his lips moving 
silently behind his faceplate and re- 
membered they were still on main 
radio communication. Both men 
switched to subsidiary audio cir- 
cuits that used small microphones 
and speakers on their chest panels. 

“The suit radios seem to have 
packed up,” Kraemer said casual- 
ly, then his professional composure 
cracked. “Is it a dream? Is it? Is it 
a dream?” His voice was hoarse. 

“If it is, we’re all in it together. 
What do you think of the ruins over 
there?”' 

Kraemer shielded his eyes and 
for the first time saw the buildings. 
“They remind me of fortifications.” 
“Me, too.’’ Garamond’s mind 
made an intuitive leap. “It wasn’t 
always possible to stroll in here the 
way we just did.” 

“All those dead ships?” 

“I’d say a lot of people once tried 
to come through that opening, and 
other people tried to keep them 
out.” 

"But why should they keep any- 
body out? I mean, if the whole 
inside of the sphere is like this . .” 
Kraemer gestured at the sea of 
grass. “God! If it’s all like this, 
there’s as much living room as 
you’d find on a million Earths.” 
“More,” Garamond told him. 
“I’ve already done the sums. This 
sphere has a surface area equiva- 
lent to 625,000,000 times the total 
surface of Earth. If we allow for the 
fact that only a quarter of the 



Earth’s surface is land and perhaps 
only half of that is usable, it means 
the sphere is equivalent to five 
billion Earths.” 

“That’s one each for every man, 
woman and child in existence.” 

“Provided one thing.” 

“What’s that?” 

“That we can breathe the air.” 

“We’ll find out about that right 
now,” Kraemer said. Garamond 
felt a momentary dizziness. When 
he had been playing around with 
comparisons of the size of Earth 
and the sphere he had treated it as 
a purely mathematical exercise, his 
mind solely on the figures. Kraemer 
had gone ahead of him to think in 
terms of people actually living on 
the sphere, people arriving at the 
aperture in fleets sent from crowd- 
ed and worn-out Earth, spreading 
outward across these limitless 
prairies. Trying to accommodate 
the vision along with his other 
speculations about the origins and 
purpose of the sphere had brought 
Garamond to vertigo. And super- 
imposed on all his swirling 
thoughts, overriding every other 
consideration, a new concept of his 
personal status was struggling to be 
born. If he, Vance Garamond, gave 
humanity five billion Earths . 
then he, and not Elizabeth Lind- 
strom, would be the most important 
human being alive — and his wife 
and child would be safe. 

“There’s an analyzer kit in the 
buggy,” Kraemer said. "Shall I go 
for it?” 



58 



GALAXY 




“Of course.” Garamond was sur- 
prised by the lieutenant’s question, 
then with a flash of insight he 
understood that it had taken only a 
few minutes of exposure to the un- 
bounded lebensraum of the sphere 
to alter a relationship which was 
part of the tight, closed society of 
the Two Worlds. Kraemer was ac- 
tually reluctant to leave the secret 
garden by climbing down into the 
circular black lake, and — as a 
potential owner of a supercontin- 
ent — he saw no reason why Gara- 
mond should not go instead. So 
quickly , Garamond thought. We'll 
all be changed so quickly. 

Aloud he said, “While you’re 
getting the kit you can break the 
news to the others — they’ll want to 
see for themselves.” 

“Right.” Kraemer looked pleas- 
ed at the idea of being first with the 
most sensational story of all time. 
He went to the edge of the aperture, 
lay down and lowered his head into 
the blackness, obviously straining 
to force the helmet through the 
membrane field that retained the 
atmosphere. After wriggling side- 
ways a little to obtain his grip on 
the buggy’s leg, Kraemer slid out of 
sight into the darkness. 

Garamond again felt a sense of 
dislocation. The fact that he had 
weight, that there was a natural- 
seeming gravity pulling him “down- 
ward” against the grassy soil, creat- 
ed an illusion that he was standing 
on the surface of a planet. His in- 
stincts rebelled against the idea 



that he was standing on a thin shell 
of unknown metal, that below him 
was the hard vacuum of space, that 
the buggy was close underneath his 
feet, upside down, clinging to the 
sphere by the force of its drive. 



G aramond moved away from 
the aperture a short distance, 
annoyed by the incongruity of the 
heavy spacesuit that shut him off 
from what surely must be his 
natural element. He kneeled for a 
closer look at the grass. It grew 
thickly, in mixed varieties that to 
his inexpert eye had stems and 
laminae similar to those of Earth. 
He parted the grass, pushed his 
fingers into the matted roots and 
scooped up a handful of brown soil. 
Small crumbs of it clung to the ma- 
terial of his gloves, making moist 
smears. 

Garamond looked up and for the 
first time noticed the lacy white 
streamers of cloud. With the small 
sun positioned vertically overhead 
it was difficult to study the sky, but 
beyond the cloud he thought he 
could distinguish narrow bands of a 
lighter blue that created a delicate 
ribbed effect curving from horizon 
to horizon. He made a mental note 
to point it out to Chief Science 
Officer O’Hagan for early investi- 
gation, and returned his attention 
to the soil. Digging into it with his 
palms he came to the ubiquitous 
gray metal of the shell, its surface 
unmarked by the damp earth. 



ORBITSVILLE 



59 




Garamond placed his hand against 
the metal and tried to imagine the 
buildings of the sphere, to visualize 
the creation of an apparently seam- 
less globe of metal with a circum- 
ference of a billion kilometers. 

There could be only one source 
for such an inconceivable quantity 
of shell material, and that was the 
sun itself. Matter is energy, and 
energy is matter. Every active star 
hurls the equivalent of millions of 
tons a day of its own substance into 
space in the form of light and other 
radiations. But in the case of Pen- 
gelly's Star one individual or many 
had set up a boundary, turned that 
energy back on itself, manipulating 
and modifying it, translating it into 
matter. With precise control over 
the most elemental forces of the 
universe they had created an im- 
pervious shell of exactly the sort of 
material they wanted — harder than 
diamond. immutable, eternal. 
When the sphere was complete, 
grown to the required thickness, 
they had again dipped their hands 
into the font of energy and wrought 
fresh miracles, coating the interior 
surface of the sphere with soil and 
water and air. Organic compounds, 
even complete cells and seeds, had 
been constructed in the same way, 
because at the ultimate level of 
reality there is no difference be- 
tween a blade of grass and one of 
steel . 

“The air is good, sir.” Kraemer’s 
voice came from close behind. 
Garamond stood up, turned, saw 



that the lieutenant had opened his 
faceplate. 

“What are the readings like?” 

“A shade low on oxygen, but 
everything else is about right.” 
Kraemer was grinning like a 
schoolboy. “You should try some.” 

Garamond opened his own hel- 
met and took a deep breath. The 
air was soft and thick and pure. He 
discovered at that moment that he 
had never known truly fresh air 
before. Low shouts came from the 
direction of the aperture as other 
spacesuited figures emerged. 

“I told the others they could 
come through,” Kraemer said. “All 
except Braunek — he’s holding the 
buggy in place. That’s all right, 
isn’t it?” 

“Yes. I’ll be setting up a rota 
system to let everybody on the ship 
have a look before we go back.” 
Again Garamond sensed a differ- 
ence in Kraemer’s attitude. Before 
the lieutenant had seen the interior 
of the sphere he would not have 
cleared the buggy without obtain- 
ing permission. 

“Before we go back? But as soon 
as we signal Earth, the traffic’s all 
going to be coming this way. Why 
go back?” 

“No reason, I suppose.” Gara- 
mond had been thinking of Aileen 
and her reluctance ever to travel 
more than a few kilometers from 
their apartment. He had been 
planning to return her to the old 
familiar Surroundings as soon as 
possible, but perhaps there was no 



60 



GALAXY 




need. Standing on the interior sur- 
face of the sphere was as close as 
one could get to being on the 
infinite plane of the geometer, yet 
there was nothing in the experience 
to inspire agoraphobia. The line of 
sight did not tangent away from the 
downward curve of a planet and so 
the uniform density of the air set a 
limit to the distance a man could 
see. Garamond studied the hori- 
zon. It appeared to curve upward 
slightly, in contrast to that of 
Earth, but it did not seem much 
farther away. There was no sense of 
peering into immensities. 

Kraemer put the toe of one boot 
down into the small hole Garamond 
had made and tapped the metal at 
the bottom. “Did you find any- 
thing?” 

“Such as?” 

“Circuits. For this synthetic 
gravity.” 

“No. I don’t think we’ll find any 
circuits in our sense of the word.” 
“What, then?” 

“Atoms with their interiors re- 
arranged or specially designed to 
do a job. Perfect machines.” 
“Sounds incredible.” 

“We’ve taken the first step in 
that direction ourselves with our 
magnetic resonance engines. Any- 
way, what could be more incredible 
than all this?” Some instinct 
prompted Garamond to push the 
soil back into the hole and tamp it 
down with his foot, repairing the 
damage he had done to the grassy 
surface. In the region close to the 



aperture the soil was thinly distri- 
buted, but there were hills in the 
distance that looked as though they 
could have been formed by drifting. 

“As soon as your men have got 
over the shock, tell them to gather 
vegetation and soil samples,” he 
said. 

“I already have,” Kraemer re- 
plied carelessly. “By the way, none 
of the suit radios is working, 
though mine was all right again 
when I went back out through the 
aperture.” 

“There must be a damping ef- 
fect — that’s something else for 
O’Hagan to investigate when he 
gets here. Let’s have a look at those 
ruins.” 

They walked to the nearest of the 
indistinct mounds. Under the 
blanket of climbing grasses there 
was just enough remaining struc- 
ture to suggest a floor plan of mas- 
sive walls and simple square rooms. 
Here and there, close to the black 
lake of stars, were distorted me- 
tallic stumps that had once been 
parts of machines. They had a 
sagging, lava-flow appearance as if 
they had been destroyed by intense 
heat. 

Kraemer gave a low whistle. 
“Who do you think won? The folks 
trying to get in, or the ones trying to 
keep them out?” 

“I’d say the invaders won, Lieu- 
tenant. I’ve been thinking about all 
those dead ships hanging out there. 
They can’t be in their battle sta- 
tions because even if they had been 



ORBITSVILLE

stationary during the fight the 
forces used against them would have 
kicked them adrift and there would 
have been nothing for us to find. It 
looks as though they were rounded 
up and carefully parked just out- 
side the aperture.” 

“Why?” 

“For salvage, maybe. There may 
be no metals available within the 
sphere.” 

“For beating into ploughshares? 
It’s good farming country, all right, 
but where are the farmers?” 

“Nomads? Could be you don’t 
have to till the soil. Maybe you just 
keep moving, following the seasons, 
with the grain always ripening just 
ahead of you.” 

Kraemer laughed. “What sea- 
sons? It must always be high 
summer here — and high noon, too. 
It can’t get dark with that sun right 
above your head." 

“But it is getting dark, Lieu- 
tenant.” Garamond spoke peace- 
fully, all capacity for surprise ex- 
hausted. “Look over there.” 

He pointed at the horizon beyond 
the black ellipse of the aperture. 
There the shimmering blue-greens 
of the distance had begun to 
deepen. There was an unmistak- 
able gathering of shade. 

“That’s impossible,” Kraemer 
protested. He looked up at the sun. 
“Oh, no!” 

Garamond looked up too and 
saw that the sun was no longer 
circular. It had one straight side, 
like a gold coin from which some- 



body had clipped a generous seg- 
ment. Shouts from the other men 
indicated that they had noticed the 
event. While they watched, the still 
brilliant area of the sun’s disk grew 
progressively smaller as though a 
shutter were being drawn across it. 
At the same time, keeping pace, 
the darkness increased on the cor- 
responding horizon and a new phe- 
nomenon made itself apparent. 
The delicate ribbed effect Gara- 
mond had noticed in the sky earlier 
became clearer, the alternating 
bands of lighter and darker blue 
now standing out vividly. In the 
space. of a minute, as the sun began 
to disappear completely, the slim 
curving ribs became the dominant 
feature of the sky, swirling across it 
from two foci, as sharply defined as 
the striations in polished agate. 
Near the horizon, where they 
dipped behind denser levels of air, 
the bands blurred and dispersed 
into a prismatic haze. The last 
searing sliver of sun vanished and 
Garamond glimpsed a wall of 
shadow rushing over the landscape 
towards him at orbital speed. Then 
it was night, beneath a canopy of 
stratified sapphire. 

Garamond stayed beside the lake 
of stars for an hour before return- 
ing to his ship and sending a 
tachyonic signal to Starflight 
House. 

VIII 

I t was almost exactly four months 
later that Elizabeth Lindstrom’s 



62 



GALAXY 




flagship took up its station outside 
the sphere’s entrance. 

Garamond had spent part of the 
time carrying out investigations 
into Orbitsville — the name for the 
sphere had originated with an 
unknown crew member — but the 
Bissendorf was primarily equipped 
for locate-and-report missions. It 
did not carry a large science team. 
So the studies were necessarily 
limited. But the astronomy section, 
under Sammy Yamoto, did make 
another profound discovery. There 
was yet another sphere surrounding 
Pengelly’s Star. 

It was smaller than Orbitsville, 
non-material in nature yet capable 
of reflecting or deflecting the sun’s 
outpourings of light and heat. 
Yamoto described it as a “globular 
filigree of force fields,” a phrase of 
which he was inordinately proud, 
judging by the frequency with 
which it was used in his reports. Of 
the inner sphere’s surface area, 
precisely half was made up of 
narrow strips, effectively opaque, 
curving in a general north-south 
direction. Their function was to 
cast great moving bars of shadow 
on the grasslands of Orbitsville, 
producing the alternating periods 
of light and darkness, day and 
night, without which plant life 
could not survive. 

Yamoto was not able to observe 
the inner sphere directly, but he 
could chart its structure by study- 
ing the bands of light and darkness 
as they moved across the far side of 



Orbitsville, 320 million kilometers 
away in the “night” sky. And he 
was able to show that the shadow 
sphere not only created night and 
day but was also responsible for a 
■progression of seasons. In one 
quarter of the sphere, correspond- 
ing to winter, the opaque night- 
producing strips were wider and 
therefore separated by narrower 
gaps of light; at the opposite side 
the strips were reduced in width to 
engender the shorter nights and 
longer days of summer. 

To facilitate Yamoto’s work a 
small plastic observatory was pre- 
fabricated in the Bissendorf s work- 
shops and transferred to a site 
within Orbitsville. Several more 
buildings were added as other sec- 
tions found reason to prolong their 
work in the interior, and the nu- 
cleus of a scientific colony was 
formed. 

A substantial portion of the re- 
search was devoted to the annoying 
riddle of why no radio communi- 
cator would work inside the sphere. 
At first it was anticipated that a 
simple solution and practical 
remedy would be found, but the 
weeks slipped by without any pro- 
gress being made. It appeared that 
the equally inexplicable synthetic 
gravity field was responsible for 
damping out all electromagnetic 
radiation. In an effort to get new 
data on the mechanics of the phe- 
nomenon, O’Hagan’s team took a 
photographic torpedo and gave it 
enough extra thrust to enable it to 



ORBITSVILLE 



63 




take off from the inner surface of 
Orbitsville. The purpose of the ex- 
periment was to measure the gravity 
gradient and to see if the radio 
guidance and telemetry systems 
would operate if the signals were 
traveling at right angles to the sur- 
face. After a flawless programed 
start, the torpedo began tracing 
random patterns in the sky and 
made a programed automatic land- 
ing several kilometers away from 
the aperture. Pessimists predicted 
that the only long-range communi- 
cation possible on Orbitsville would 
be by modulation of light beams. 

Another discovery was that the 
utterly inert ,%nd incredibly hard 
shell of the sphere was impervious 
to all radiation except gravity 
waves. The latter were able to pass 
through, otherwise the star system’s 
outer planet would have tangented 
off toward interstellar space, but 
not even the most energetic par- 
ticles entered Orbitsville from the 
outer universe except through the 
aperture. Certain peculiarities in 
the measurements of radiation 
levels from Pengelly’s Star itself led 
O’Hagan to give Garamond a con- 
fidential report in which he sug- 
gested that flickerwing ships might 
not be able to operate within the 
sphere, due to lack of available 
reaction mass. The subject was ear- 
marked for priority investigation by 
the fully equipped' teams that would 
arrive later. 

Garamond received an increas- 
ing number of requests from crew- 



men, especially those who were in- 
active when the main drive was not 
in use, for permission to stay on 
Orbitsville under canvas. At first he 
encouraged the idea, but Napier 
reported that the remaining per- 
sonnel were becoming resentful of 
their relaxed and sunburned col- 
leagues. Partly to combat the divi- 
sive emotions, Garamond took the 
Bissendorf on a circuit of Orbits- 
ville's equatorial plane and estab- 
lished that no other entrances were 
visible. 

He also set teams to work moving 
the swarm of dead ships a thousand 
kilometers down orbit from the 
aperture. With the ships at their 
new station, they were boarded by 
photographic teams that made rec- 
ords of their findings. These con- 
firmed Garamond’s first guess that 
the hulks had been used as mines 
and sources of supply. The interiors 
were gutted, stripped to the bare 
metal of the hulls, and in some 
cases it turned out that what had 
been thought to be the havoc of 
battle was actually the work of sca- 
vengers. An unfortunate byproduct 
was that virtually nothing was 
found to indicate the appearance of 
the aliens who had built and flown 
the huge fleet. The most significant 
clue was a section of metal staircase 
and handrailing that hinted the 
aliens had been bipeds of about the 
same size as humans. 

Where were they now? 

That question came in for more 
discussion than did speculations on 



64 



GALAXY 




the whereabouts of the beings who 
had created Orbitsville. It. was 
understood that the sphere-builders 
had possessed a technology of an 
entirely different order to that of 
the race which had produced the 
ships. The instinctive belief was 
that the sphere-builders were un- 
knowable, that they had moved on 
to new adventures or new phases of 
their existence, because it would be 
impossible to be near them without 
their presence being felt. Orbits- 
ville appeared to be and was 
accepted as a gift from the galactic 
past. 

Garamond brought Aileen and 
Christopher into the sphere, 
through the newly constructed L- 
shaped entrance port, for a 
strangely peaceful vacation. Aileen 
was able to adjust to Orbitsville’s 
up-curving horizons without any 
psychological upsets, and Chris 
took to the place like a foal turned 
loose in spring pastures. In the day- 
time Garamond watched the boy’s 
skin acquire the gold of the new- 
found sun, and at night he sat out- 
side with Aileen beneath the fabu- 
lous archways of the sky, their 
gratification all the more intense 
because of the period of despair 
that had preceded it. 

Only in dreams, or in the half- 
world between consciousness and 
sleep, did Garamond feel appre- 
hension. Mostly he tried not to 
think of Elizabeth advancing across 
the light-years that lay between 
Orbitsville and Earth. 



T o the unaided vision it would 
have appeared that her flagship 
came alone. In fact it was at the 
head of a fleet of seventy vessels, 
but an interstellar ramjet on main- 
drive was surrounded by its intake 
field, a vast insubstantial maw with 
an area of up to half-a-million 
square kilometers. For that reason 
the closest formation ever flown 
was in the form of a thousand- 
kilometer grid. The fleet was un- 
wieldy even by Starflight standards. 
It spent two days in matching ve- 
locities with the galactic drift of 
Pengelly’s Star and in deploying its 
individual units in parking orbit. 
When each ship had been accurate- 
ly positioned and its electromag- 
netic wings furled, the flagship — 
Starflier IV — advanced slowly on 
ion drive until it was almost along- 
side the Bissendorf. Captain Vance 
Garamond received a formal invi- 
tation to come on board. 

The act of donning the black- 
and-silver dress uniform, for the 
first time ever in the course of a 
mission, reminded him acutely that 
once again he was within Eliza- 
beth’s sphere of influence. He was 
not conscious of any fear — Orbits- 
ville had had too profound an effect 
on the situation for that — yet he 
was filled with vague distaste each 
time he thought of the forthcoming 
interview. For the past four months 
he had been certain that Eliza- 
beth’s consequence had been re- 
duced to normal human dimen- 
sions, but her arrival at the head of 



ORBITSVILLE 



65 




an armada suggested that the old 
order was still a reality. For her, the 
only reality. 

The sight of his dress uniform 
disturbed Aileen, too. Later, as the 
transit dock opened and the little 
buggy ventured out into the black 
ocean of space, Garamond remem- 
bered the way his wife had kissed 
him. She had been abstracted, 
almost cold, and had turned away 
quickly. It had been as though she 
were suppressing all emotion, but 
in his final glimpse of her she had 
been holding their golden snail 
against her cheek. 

Garamond stood behind the pilot 
of the buggy for the whole of the 
short trip, watching the flagship ex- 
pand until it filled the forward 
screens. When the docking ma- 
neuver had been completed he 
stepped watchfully but confidently 
into the transit bay where a group 
of Starflight officials were waiting. 
Behind the officials were a number 
of men in civilian dress and carry- 
ing scene recorders. With a mini- 
mum of ceremony Garamond was 
escorted to the Presidential suite 
and ushered into the principal 
stateroom. Elizabeth must have 
given previous instructions, because 
his escorts withdrew immediately 
and in silence. 

The President was standing with 
her back to the door. She was wear- 
ing a long close-fitting gown of 
white satin, her favorite style of 
dress. Three white spaniels floated 
drowsily in the air close to her feet. 



Garamond was shocked to see that 
Elizabeth had lost most of her hair. 
The thinning black strands clung to 
her scalp in patches, making her 
look old and diseased. She con- 
tinued to stand with her back to 
him although she must have been 
aware of his presence. 

“My Lady . .” Garamond 
scuffed the floor with his mag- 
netic-soled boots, and the President 
slowly turned. The skin of her 
small-chinned face was pale and 
glistening. 

“Why did you do it. Captain?” 
Her voice was low. “Why did you 
run from me?” 

“My Lady, I . .” Garamond, 
unprepared for a direct question, 
was lost for words. 

“Why were you afraid of me?” 

“I panicked. What happened to 
your son was pure accident. He fell 
when I wasn’t even near him. But I 
panicked and ran.” It occurred to 
Garamond that Elizabeth might 
have sound political and tactical 
reasons for choosing to meet him as 
a mother who had lost a child 
rather than as an empress in 
danger of being usurped. But that 
did not lessen her advantage. 

Incredibly, Elizabeth smiled her 
asymmetrical, knowing smile. “You 
thought I wouldn’t understand, 
that I might lash out at you.” 

“It would have been a natural re- 
action.” 

“You shouldn’t have been afraid 
of me, Captain.” 

“I . I’m glad.” This is fan- 



66 



GALAXY 




tastic. Garamond thought numbly. 
She doesn't believe any of it. I don't 
believe any of it. So why go on with 
the charade? 

. suffered, and you’ve suf- 
fered,” Elizabeth was saying. “I 
think we always will, but I want you 
to know that I bear you no grudge.” 
She came closer to him, still smil- 
ing, and her soft satiny abdomen 
brushed his knuckles. Garamond 
thought of spiders. 

“There isn't any way I can ex- 
press how sorry I am that the acci- 
dent occurred.” 

“I know.” Elizabeth’s voice was 
gentle, but suddenly the room was 
filled with her sweet, soupy odor 
and Garamond knew that just for 
an instant she had thought of 
killing him. 

“My Lady, if this is too much for 
you . .” 

Her face hardened instantly. 
“What makes you think so?” 

“Nothing.” 

“Very well, then. We have im- 
portant business to discuss, Cap- 
tain. Did you know that the Coun- 
cil, with my consent, has autho- 
rized the payment to you of ten 
million monits?” 

Garamond shook his head. “Ten 
million?” 

“Yes. Does that seem a lot of 
money to you?” 

“It seems all the money there is.” 

Elizabeth laughed and turned 
away from him, disturbing the 
spaniels in their airborne slumbers. 
“It’s nothing, Captain. Nothing! 



You will, of course, be appointed to 
the council I’m setting up to advise 
on the development and exploita- 
tion of Lindstromland, and your 
salary from that alone will be two 
million monits a year. Then 
there’s ...” Elizabeth paused. 
“What’s the matter, Captain? You 
look surprised.” 

“I am.” 

“At the size of your salary? Or 
the fact that the sphere has been of- 
ficially named after my family?” 

“The name of the sphere is un- 
important,” Garamond said 
stonily, too disturbed by what 
Elizabeth had said to think about 
exhibited the proper degree of def- 
erence. “What is important is that 
it can’t be controlled and exploited. 
You sounded as if you were plan- 
ning to parcel up the land and sell 
it in the same way that Terranova is 
handled.” 

“We don’t sell plots on Terra- 
nova — they are given freely, 
through Government-controlled 
agencies.” 

“To anybody who can pay the 
Starflight transportation charge. 
It’s the same thing.” 

“Really?” Elizabeth examined 
Garamond through narrowed eyes. 
“You’re an expert on such matters, 
are you?” 

“I don’t need to be. The facts are 
easily understood.” Garamond felt 
he was rushing toward a dangerous 
precipice, but he had no desire to 
hold back. 

“In that case you’ll make an ex- 



ORBITSVILLE 



67 




cellent council member — all the 
others regard the Starfiight opera- 
tion as being extremely complex.” 

“In practice,” Garamond said 
doggedly. “But not in principle.” 

Elizabeth gave her second unex- 
pected smile of the interview. “In 
principle, then, why can’t Lind- 
stromland be developed in the 
normal way?” 

“For the same reason that water- 
sellers can make a living only in the 
desert.” 

“You mean where there’s a lot of 
water freely available nobody will 
pay for it.” 

“No doubt that sounds childishly 
simple to you, My Lady, but it’s 
what I meant.” 

“I’m intrigued by your thought 
processes, Captain.” Elizabeth was 
giving no sign of being angered by 
Garamond’s attitude. “How can 
you compare selling water and 
opening up a new world?” 

Garamond gave a short laugh. 
“Yours are the intriguing thought 
processes — if you’re comparing Or- 
bitsville to an ordinary planet.” 

“Orbitsville?” 

“Lindstromland. It isn’t like an 
ordinary planet.” 

“I’m aware of the difference in 
size.” 

“You aren’t.” 

Elizabeth’s tolerance began to 
fade. “Be careful of what you say, 
Captain.” 

“With respect, My Lady, you 
aren’t aware of the difference in 
size. Nobody is, and nobody ever 



will be. I myself am not aware of it, 
and I’ve flown right around Orbits- 
ville.” 

“Surely the fact that you were 
able to . .” 

“I was traveling at a hundred 
thousand kilometers an hour,” 
Garamond said in a steady voice. 
“At that speed I could have orbited 
the Earth in twenty-five minutes. 
Do you know how long it took to get 
around Orbitsville? Forty-two 
days!” 

“I grant you we’re dealing with a 
new order of magnitude.” 

“And that’s only a linear com- 
parison. Don’t you see there’s just 
no way you can handle the amount 
of living space involved?” 

Elizabeth shrugged. “I’ve al- 
ready told you that Starfiight 
doesn’t concern itself with the ap- 
portionment of land, so the exact 
area of Lindstromland is of no con- 
cern to us. We will, of course, con- 
tinue to make a fair profit from our 
transportation services.” 

“But that’s the whole point,” 
Garamond said angrily. “Even if it 
wasn’t a disguised land charge, the 
transportation fee should be abol- 
ished.” 

“Why?” 

“Because we now have all the 
land we can use. In those circum- 
stances it is intolerable that there 
should be any kind of economic 
brake on the natural and instinctive 
flow of people toward the new 
land,” 

“You, of all people, should know 



68 



GALAXY 




that there’s nothing natural or, in- 
stinctive about building and sailing 
a flickerwing ship.” A rare tinge of 
color was appearing in Elizabeth’s 
waxy cheeks. “It can’t be done 
without money.” 

Garamond shook his head. “Not 
money. People.’ It can’t be done 
without people. A culture that had 
never developed the concept of 
money, or property, could cross 
space just as well as we do.” 

“At last!” Elizabeth took two 
quick steps toward Garamond, 
then stopped, swaying in magnetic 
shoes. “At last I know you, Cap- 
tain. If money is so distasteful to 
you, I take it you are refusing a 
place on the development council?” 
“I am.” 

“And your bounty? Ten million 
monits from the pockets of the 
people of the Two Worlds. You’re 
refusing that, too?” 

“I’m refusing that, too.” 
“You’re too late,” Elizabeth 
snapped, savoring a triumph which 
only she understood. “It has al- 
ready been credited to your ac- 
count.” 

“I’ll return it to you.” 

Elizabeth shook her head de- 
cisively. “No, Captain. You’re a 
famous man back on the Two 
Worlds — and I must be seen to give 
you everything you deserve. Now 
return to your ship.” 

On the way back to the Bissen- 
dorf, Garamond’s mind was filled 
with the President’s admission that 
he had become too important to be 



disposed of like other human be- 
ings. And yet, came the disturbing 
thought, there had been that look 
of satisfaction in her eyes. 



IX 

T he new house allocated for 
Garamond’s use was a rectan- 
gular, single-story affair. It was one 
of several dozen built from plastic 
panels that had been prefabricated 
in a Starflight workshop aboard 
one of Elizabeth’s ships. 

Situated less than two kilometers 
from the aperture, where the coat- 
ing of soil was still thin, the 
compact structure was held in place 
by suction pads installed to grip the 
underlying metal of the shell. After 
a few days, Garamond found he 
could forget the hard vacuum of 
space beginning only a few centi- 
metres below his living-room floor. 
The furnishings were sparse but 
comfortable. A full range of color 
projectors and entertainment ma- 
chines, plus an electronic tutor for 
Christopher, gave the place some- 
thing of the atmosphere of a luxury 
weekend lodge. 

There was an efficient kitchen 
initially supplied with provisions 
from shipboard stores. Of course, 
the expectation was that the colo- 
nists would becoming self-support- 
ing as regards food within a year. It 
was late summer in that part of 
Orbitsville and the grasses were ap- 
proaching a tawny ripeness. Even 



ORBITSVILLE 



69 




before a systemized agriculture 
could be established to produce 
grain harvests, the grass would be 
fully utilized — part of it syntheti- 
cally digested to create protein 
foods, the rest yielding cellulose for 
the production of a range of acetate 
plastics. 

Garamond, technically, was still 
in command of the Bissendorf, but 
he spent much of his time in the 
house, telling himself he was help- 
ing his family put down roots. In 
reality he was trying to cope with 
the feeling of having been cut 
adrift. He acquired the habit of 
standing at a window that faced the 
aperture and watching the ever-in- 
creasing tempo of activity at the 
Starflight outpost. Machinery, ve- 
hicles, supplies of all kinds came 
through the L-shaped entry tubes 
in a continuous stream; new build- 
ings were erected every day amid 
moraines of displaced soil; a skein 
of dirt roads wound around and 
through the complex, its loose ends 
straggling of into the grasslands. 
Earth’s beachhead was becoming 
well-established, and as it did so 
Garamond felt more and more 
redundant. 

“The weirdest thing about it is 
that I feel possessive, too,” he said 
to his wife. “I keep lecturing people 
about the inconceivable size of 
Orbitsville, telling them it couldn’t 
be controlled by a thousand Star- 
flight corporations. Yet I have a 
gut-feeling it’s my personal prop- 
erty. I guess that in a way I’m as 



much out of touch with reality as 
Liz Lindstrom.” 

Aileen shook her head. “You’re 
angry at the way she’s proposing to 
handle things.” 

“Angry at myself.” 

“Why?” 

“What made me think Starflight 
House would quietly bow out of 
existence to make way for a publicly 
funded transportation system? 
From what I hear, Liz’s public re- 
lations teams are plugging the no- 
tion that Starflight already is a 
quasi-government concern. That 
was a hard one to put over when 
there was just Terranova and the 
amount of land a settler got was 
determined by how much he paid 
for his passage, but now it’s dif- 
ferent.” 

“In what way?” Aileen looked up 
from the boy’s shirt she was hand- 
stitching. Her deeply tanned face 
was sympathetic but unconcerned; 
since arriving on Orbitsville she 
had developed a peaceful optimism. 
It seemed that the principal ele- 
ment of his wife’s personality, her 
unremarkable pleasantness, was 
standing her in good stead in the 
alien environment. 

“There’s to be a standard trans- 
portation charge and no limitation 
to the amount of land a settler can 
occupy. That will make the opera- 
tion seem pretty altruistic to most 
people.” 

Since turning down membership 
in Elizabeth’s development council 
Garamond had found it difficult to 



70 



GALAXY 




keep himself informed of her activ- 
ities. Still, he could guess the ap- 
proach she was using to sell Orbits- 
ville on overcrowded Earth. The 
newly established fact that above a 
layer of air the volume of space 
within the sphere was totally free of 
hydrogen or other matter, ruling 
out the use of flickerwing ships, 
could even be turned to Starflight’s 
advantage. It was likely that a long 
time would elapse before the un- 
wieldy and inefficient type of ship 
that carried its own reaction mass 
could be redeveloped sufficiently to 
make any impression on the five 
billion Earth-areas available within 
the sphere. Orbitsville, then, was 
truly the ultimate frontier, a place 
where a man and his family could 
load up a solar-powered vehicle 
with supplies, plus an “iron cow” 
to convert grass into food, and 
drive off into a green infinity. 

The life would be simple, and 
perhaps hard — in many ways 
similar to that of a pioneer in the 
American West — but in the coast- 
to-coast urbs of Earth there was a 
great yearning for just that kind of 
escape. The risk of dying of over- 
work or simple appendicitis on a 
lonely farm hundreds of light-years 
from Earth was infinitely prefer- 
able to the prospect of going down 
in a food riot in Paris or Mel- 
bourne. No matter how much Star- 
flight charged for passage to Or- 
bitsville, there would always be 
more than enough people to fill the 
big ships. 



“Does the President have to be 
altruistic?” Aileen said, and Gara- 
mond knew that she was drawing 
comparisons between Liz Lind- 
strom and herself, between a 
woman who had unexpectedly lost 
a son and one whose husband and 
child had been reprieved. “What’s 
wrong with making a reasonable 
percentage on services rendered?” 

“In this case — everything.” 

Garamond suppressed a pang of 
annoyance. “Don’t you see that? 
Look, Earth has been raped and 
polluted and choked to death, but 
right here on Orbitsville there’s 
room for every human being there 
is to lose himself forever. We’ve 
made all the mistakes and ' learned 
all the lessons back on Earth, and 
now we’ve been given this chance to 
start off from scratch again. The 
situation demands an almost com- 
plete transfer of population — and it 
could be done, Aileen. At our level 
of technology it could be done, but 
the entire Starflight operation is 
based on it not being done!” 
Garamond returned to staring 
through his window. “In order for 
Elizabeth to go on making her 
quote reasonable percentage un- 
quote there has to be a potential, a 
high population pressure on Earth 
and a low one elsewhere. I wouldn’t 
be surprised if it turned out that the 
Lindstroms are behind the failure 
of all the main population-control 
programs.” 

“That’s ridiculous, Vance.” 
Aileen began to laugh. 



ORBITSVILLE

“Is it?” Garamond turned away 
from the window, mollified by his 
wife’s good cheer. “Maybe so, but 
you don’t hear them complaining 
much about the birth rate.” 

“Talking about birth rates — our 
own has been pretty static for a 
long time.” Aileen caught his hand 
and held it against her cheek. 
“Wouldn’t you like to be the father 
of the first child born on Orbits- 
ville?” 

“I’m not sure. It’s impossible, 
anyway. The first shiploads of 
settlers are on their way. And from 
what I’ve heard about the Terra- 
nova run, a lot of the women always 
arrive pregnant. It has something 
to do with the lack of recreational 
facilities on that journey.” 

“How about the first one con- 
ceived on Orbitsville, then?” 
“That’s more like it.” Garamond 
kneeled beside his wife’s chair, 
took her in his arms. They kissed. 

Aileen drew back after a few 
seconds. “You’ll have to do better 
than that.” 

“I’m sorry. I keep thinking 
about the people, beings or gods — 
whatever you want to call them — 
who built Orbitsville.” 

“Who doesn’t?” 

“I don’t understand them.” 
“Who does?” 

“You know, there’s enough liv- 
ing space in Orbitsville to support 
every intelligent being in the galaxy. 
For all we know, that’s why it was 
created, and yet . .” 

Garamond allowed his voice to 



die away. He suspected Aileen 
would accuse him of paranoia if he 
speculated aloud about why the 
sphere-builders had created a hostel 
for an entire galaxy’s homeless — 
and then played into Elizabeth 
Lindstrom’s hands by providing 
only one entrance. 

C hick Truman was one of a 
breed of human beings who 
had come into existence with the 
development of interstellar travel. 
He was a frontiersman-technician. 
His father and grandfather had 
helped with the opening up of 
Terranova and with the initial sur- 
veying of a dozen other planets 
which, although unsuitable for 
colonization, had some commercial 
or scientific potential. He had re- 
ceived little in the way of formal 
technical training but, like all other 
members of the fraternity of gypsy- 
engineers, seemed to have an in- 
born knowledge of the entire range 
of mechanical skills. It was as 
though the accumulated experience 
of generations had begun to pro- 
duce men for whom the analysis of 
an electrical circuit or the tuning of 
an engine was a matter of instinct. 

One attribute that distinguished 
Truman from most of his fellows 
was a strong if undisciplined in- 
terest in philosophy. And it was this 
that had fired his mind as he had 
set up camp on the lower slopes of 
the hills that ringed Orbitsville’s 
single aperture at a distance of 
about sixty kilometers.

GALAXY 




Truman was half of a two-man 
team sent out to erect a bank of 
laser reflectors as part of an experi- 
mental communications system. 
The pair had reached its destina- 
tion minutes before the wall of 
darkness had come rushing from 
the east, and now Truman’s part- 
ner — Peter Krogt — was busy pre- 
paring food and laying out their 
sleeping bags. Truman himself was 
concerned with less prosaic matters. 
He had lit a pipe of tobacco, 
comfortably seated with his back to 
the transporter, he stared into the 
incredible ribbed archways of the 
night sky. 

“The Assumption of Mediocrity 
is a useful philosophical weapon,” 
he was saying, “but it can backfire 
on the guy who uses it. I know that 
some of the greatest advances in 
human thought were achieved by 
assuming there’s nothing odd or 
freakish about our own little 
patch — that’s what set Albert Ein- 
stein off.” 

“Help me open these contain- 
ers,” Krogt said. 

Without moving, Truman releas- 
ed a cloud of aromatic smoke. “But 
consider the case of, say, two 
beetles living at the bottom of a 
hole on a golf course. These bugs 
have never been out of that hole, 
but if they have a philosophical 
turn of mind they can describe the 
rest of the universe just on the 
strength of available evidence. 
What would their universe be like, 
Pete?” 



“Who cares?” 

“Nice attitude, Pete. Their pro- 
jected universe would be an infinite 
series of round holes with big white 
balls dropping into them during 
daylight hours." 

Krogt had opened the food con- 
tainers unaided. He handed one to 
Truman. “What are you talking 
about, Chick?” 

“I’m telling you what’s wrong 
with the management back at base. 
Listen — we’ve been on Orbitsville 
for months, right?” 

“Right.” 

“Now, take this little jaunt we’re 
on right now. These hills are three 
hundred meters high. Our orders 
are to set up the reflectors at an ele- 
vation of two hundred and fifty 
meters. We’ve been told where to 
set them, where to aim them, what 
deviation will be acceptable, how 
long to take with the assignment — 
but there’s one thing we haven’t 
been told. And I find it a pretty 
astonishing omission, Pete.” 

“Your yeasteak’s getting cold.” 

“Why did nobody tell us to climb 
the extra fifty meters to the top of 
the hill and have a look at the other 
side?” 

“Because there’s no need,” Krogt 
said heavily. “There’s nothing there 
but grass and scrub. The whole in- 
side of this ball is nothing but 
prairie.” 

“There you go! The Assumption 
of Mediocrity." 

“It isn’t an assumption.” Krogt 
gestured with his fork at the shim- 



ORBITSVILLE 



73 




mering watered-silk canopy of the 
sky. “They’ve had a look around 
with telescopes.” 

“Telescopes!” Truman sneered 
to cover up the fact that he had for- 
gotten about telescopic examination 
of the far side of Orbitsville, then 
his talent for rapid mental calcula- 
tion came to his aid. ‘‘We’re 
talking about a distance of more 
than two astronomical units, sonny. 
If you were standing on Earth, 
what would one of those spyglasses 
tell you about life on Mars?” 
“More’n I want to know. Are you 
going to eat this yeasteak or will I?” 
“You eat it.” 

Truman got to his feet, slightly 
dismayed at the way in which a 
discussion on philosophy had led 
him to renounce his meal, and 
marched away up the slope. He was 
breathing heavily by the time he 
reached the rounded summit. There 
he paused to re-light his pipe. The 
yellow flame from the lighter 
dazzled his eyes, so almost a 
minute passed before Truman rea- 
lized that spread out on the plain 
below him, dim and peaceful, were 
the lights of an alien civilization. 

X 

T he arrival of the first wave of 
passenger ships had surprised 
Garamond in two ways — by the 
timing, which could have been 
achieved only if they had set out 
within days of Elizabeth’s own ar- 
rival on Orbitsville; and by their 



number. There were eighty Type 
G2 vessels, each of which carried 
more than four thousand people. A 
third of a million settlers, who 
originally must have been destined 
for the relatively well-prepared ter- 
ritories of Terranova, had been di- 
verted to a new destination where 
there was not even a shed to give 
them shelter on their first night. 

“It beats me,” Cliff Napier said, 
sipping his morning coffee. He was 
off duty and had spent the night in 
Garamond’s house. “All right, so 
Terranova has only one usable con- 
tinent and it’s filling up fast, but 
the situation isn’t all that urgent. 
No matter how you look at it, these 
people are going to. have a rough 
time for a while. They haven’t even 
got proper transportation for this 
place.” 

“You’re wondering why they 
agreed to come?” Garamond ask- 
ed, finishing his own coffee. 

Napier nodded. ‘‘The average 
colonist is a family .man. He doesn’t 
want to expose his wife and kids to 
more unknotvn risks than neces- 
sary. How did Starflight get them 
to fly here?” 

“I’ll tell you.” Aileen came into 
the room with a pot of fresh coffee 
and began refilling the cups. “Chris 
and I were down at the store this 
morning while you two were still in 
your beds. I spoke to people who 
saw the newcomers disembarking 
before dawn. You know, you don’t 
learn much by lying around snor- 
ing-” 



74 



GALAXY 




“All right, Aileen, we both think 
you’re wonderful. Now, what are 
you talking about?" 

“They were given free passage,” 
Aileen said, obviously pleased at 
being able to impart that news. 

Garamond shook his head. “I 
can’t believe it!” 

“It's true, Vance. They say Star- 
flight House is giving free travel to 
anybody who signs on for Lind- 
stromland within six months.” 

“It’s a trick.” 

"Oh. Vance!” Aileen’s eyes were 
reproachful. “Why don’t you admit 
you were wrong about Elizabeth? 
Besides, what sort of a trick could it 
be? What could she hope to gain?” 

“It’s a trick,” Garamond said 
stubbornly. “What she’s done isn’t 
even legal — the teams from the 
Government land agencies haven’t 
got here yet.” 

“But you always say the law 
doesn’t mean anything to the Lind- 
stroms.” 

“Not when they want to take 
something. This is different.” 

“Now you’re being childish,” 
Aileen snapped. 

“He isn’t,” Napier said. “Take 
our word for it, Aileen — Liz Lind- 
strom never acts out of character.” 

Aileen’s face had lost some of its 
natural color. “Oh, you know it all, 
of course. You know all about how 
it feels for a woman to lose her 
only . .” She stopped speaking 
abruptly. 

“Child,” Garamond finished for 
her. “Don’t hold anything back .” 



“I’m sorry. It’s just . .” Lenses 
of tears magnified Aileen’s eyes as 
she walked out of the room. 

The two men finished their coffee 
in silence, each lost in his own 
thoughts. Garamond wondered if 
the feeling of pointlessness silting 
through him was due to his having 
to stand by helplessly while the 
President imposed her will on 
Orbitsville, or if it sprang from the 
slow realization that he was out of a 
job. The entire Stellar Exploration 
Arm had become superfluous be- 
cause there was no need for the big 
ships to search the star fields ever 
again. Could it be, he wondered, 
that l existed only for the search? 

With an obvious effort at 
diplomacy, Napier began discuss- 
ing the work being carried out by 
the Starflight research teams. De- 
spite the use of more sophisticated 
and more powerful cutting tools 
than had been available on board 
the Bissendorf, nobody had man- 
aged even to scratch the shell ma- 
terial. At the same time, studies of 
the inner shell were indicating that 
its movement was not a simple east- 
west rotation, but that subtle geo- 
metries were involved. Their object, 
apparently, was to produce a nor- 
mal progression of day and night 
close to the polar areas. 

Another team had been working 
continuously on the diaphragm 
field that prevented the atmosphere 
from rushing into space through 
the kilometer-wide aperture in the 
outer shell. No significant progress 



ORBITSVILLE 



75 




had been made there, either. The 
force field employed was unlike 
anything ever generated by human 
engineers in that it reacted equally 
against the passage of metallic and 
non-metallic objects. Observations 
of the field showed that it was 
lenticular in shape, being several 
meters thick at the center. Unlike 
the shell material, it was trans- 
parent to cosmic rays and actually 
appeared to refract them. The dis- 
covery had led to the suggestion 
that as well as being a sealing de- 
vice it was intended to disperse 
cosmic rays in such a way as to pro- 
duce a small degree of mutation in 
Orbitsville’s flora and fauna — if the 
latter existed. In general, the field 
seemed more amenable than the 
shell material to investigation be- 
cause it had proved possible to 
cause small local alterations in its 
structure and to produce temporary 
leaks by firing beams of electrons 
through it. 

“Interesting stuff,” Napier con- 
cluded. 

“Fascinating,” Garamond said 
automatically. 

“You don’t sound convinced. 
I’m going to have a look at the new 
arrivals.” 

Garamond smiled. “Okay, Cliff. 
We’ll see you for lunch.” 

He got to his feet and was 
walking to the door with Napier 
when the communicator set, which 
had been connected to the central 
exchange by a landline pending a 
solution of the radio transmission 



problem, chimed to announce an 
incoming call. Garamond pressed 
the ACCEPT button and the solid 
image of a heavy-shouldered and 
prematurely gray young man ap- 
peared at the projection focus. He 
was wearing civilian clothing and 
his face was unknown to Gara- 
mond. 

“Good morning, Captain,” the 
stranger said in a slightly breathless 
voice. “I’m Colbert Mason of the 
Two Worlds News Agency. Have 
any other reporters been in touch 
with you?” 

“Other reporters? No.” 

“Thank God for that — I’m the 
first!” Mason said fervently. 

“The first? I didn’t know Star- 
flight had authorized transporta- 
tion for newsmen.” 

“They haven’t.” Mason gave a 
shaky laugh. “I had to emigrate to 
this place with my wife more or less 
permanently, and I know other re- 
porters have done the same thing. 
I’m just lucky my ship disembarked 
first. If you’ll give me an interview, 
that is.” 

“Have you been off-world be- 
fore?” 

“No, sir. First time, but I’d have 
gone right around the galaxy for 
this chance.” 



G aramond recognized the flat- 
tery but also found himself 
genuinely impressed by the young 
newsman. “What did you want to 
talk to me about?” 



76 



GALAXY 




“What did I . .?•” Mason 
spread his hands helplessly. “The 
lot! Anything and everything. Do 
you know, sir, that back on Earth 
you’re regarded as the most famous 
man ever? Even if you’d answered 
the tachygrams we sent you, we’d 
still have considered it worthwhile 
to try for a face-to-face interview.” 
“Tachygrams? I got no signals 
from Earth. Hold on a minute.” 
Garamond killed the audio channel 
and turned to Napier. “Elizabeth?” 
Napier’s heavy-lidded eyes were 
alert. “I’d say so. She didn’t like 
your views on how Orbitsville 
should be handled. In fact, I’m sur- 
prised this reporter got through the 
net. He must be exceptionally 
smart, or lucky.” 

“Let’s make him luckier.” Gara- 
mond opened the audio circuit 
again. “I’ve got a good story for 
you, Mason. Are you prepared to 
run it exactly as I tell it?” 

“Of course.” 

“Okay. Come straight out to my 
place.” 

“I can’t, sir. I called you because 
I think I’m being watched, and 
there may not be much time.” 

“All right, then. You can report 
that in my opinion the potential of 
Orbitsville is . .” 

“Orbitsville?” 

“The local name for Lindstrom- 
land ...” Garamond stopped 
speaking as the image of the 
reporter broke up into motes of 
colored light that swarmed in the 
air for a second before abruptly 



vanishing. He waited for the image 
to reestablish itself but nothing 
happened. 

“I thought it was too good to be 
true,” Napier commented. “Some- 
body pulled the plug on you.” 

“I know. Where do you think 
Mason was speaking from?” 

“Must have been from one of the 
depot stores. Those are the only 
places where he’d have any access 
to a communicator set.” 

“Let’s get down there right now.” 
Garamond pulled on a lightweight 
jacket and, without waiting to ex- 
plain to Aileen, hurried from the 
house into Orbitsville’s changeless 
noon. Christopher looked up from 
the solitary game he was playing in 
the grass but did not speak. Gara- 
mond waved to the boy and strode 
out in the direction of the clustered 
buildings around the aperture. 

“It’s bloody hot,” Napier grum- 
bled at his side. “I’m going to buy a 
parasol for walking about out- 
doors.” 

Garamond was in no mood to re- 
spond to small talk. “It’s getting 
too much like Earth and Terra- 
nova.” 

“You won’t be able to prove the 
call was blocked.” 

“I’m not even going to try.” 
They walked quickly along the 
brown dirt road that threaded 
through the scattering of residences 
and reached the belt of small ad- 
ministrative buildings, research 
laboratories and windowless store- 
houses surrounding the aperture. 



ORBITSVILLE 



77 




The black ellipse began to be dis- 
jointedly visible through a clutter of 
docking machinery and L-shaped 
entry ports. Garamond was no 
longer able to think of it as a lake of 
stars. Now it was simply a hole in 
the ground. As they were passing 
an unusually large anonymous 
building his attention was caught 
by sunlight glinting on a moving ve- 
hicle — one of the few yet to be seen 
on Orbitsville. It stopped at the en- 
trance to the building, four men got 
out and hurried inside. One of 
them had a youthful build that 
contrasted with his graying hair. 

Napier caught Garamond’s arm. 
“That looked like our man.” 

“We’ll see.” They sprinted across 
a patch of grass and into the dense 
shade of the foyer, just in time to 
glimpse an interior door closing. 
A doorman wearing Starflight emb- 
lems came out of a kiosk and tried 
to bar their way but Garamond and 
Napier went by on each side of him 
and burst through to the inner 
room. Garamond’s first glance con- 
firmed that he had found Colbert 
Mason. The reporter was between 
two men who were gripping his 
arms, and three others — one of 
whom Garamond identified as 
Silvio Laker, a member of Eliza- 
beth Lindstrom’s personal staff — 
were standing close by. Mason’s 
face had a dazed, drugged expres- 
sion. 

‘‘Hands off him,” Garamond 
commanded. 

“Out of here,” Laker said. 



"You’re outside your territory, 
Captain.” 

“I’m taking Mason with me.” 

“Like hell you are,” said one of 
the men holding Mason, stepping 
forward confidently. 

Garamond gave him a bored 
look. “I can cripple you ten dif- 
ferent ways.” He was lying, never 
having been interested in even the 
recreational forms of personal com- 
bat, but the man suddenly looked 
less confident. While he was hesi- 
tating, his partner released Mason 
and tried to snatch something from 
his pocket, but was dissuaded by 
Napier who simply moved his three- 
hundred-pound bulk in a little 
closer and looked expectant. A 
ringing silence descended on the 
sparsely furnished room. 

“Are you all right?” Garamond 
said to Mason. 

“My neck,” the reporter said un- 
certainly, fingering a pink blotch 
just above his collar. “They used a 
hypodermic spray on me.” 

“It was probably just a sedative 
to keep you quiet.” Garamond 
fixed his gaze on Laker. “For your 
sake, I hope that’s right.” 

“I warn you to stay out of this,” 
Laker said in a hoarse voice, his 
short round body quivering with 
anger. He extended his right fist, 
on which was a large gold ring set 
with a ruby. 

“Lasers are messy,” Garamond 
said. 

“I don’t mind cleaning up.” 

‘‘You’re getting in over your 



78 



GALAXY 




head. Laker. Have you thought 
about what Elizabeth would do to 
you for involving her in murder?” 

“I’ve an idea she’d like to see you 
put away.” 

“In secret, yes — not like this.” 
Garamond nodded to Napier. 
“Let’s go.” They turned the com- 
pliant, stupified reporter around 
and walked him toward the door. 

“I warn you, Garamond,” Laker 
whispered. “I’m prepared to take 
the chance.” 

“Don’t be foolish.” Garamond 
spoke without looking back. The 
door was only a few paces away now 
and he could feel an intense ting- 
ling between his shoulder blades. 
He put out his hand to grasp the 
handle, but in the instant of his 
touching it the door was flung open 
and three more men exploded into 
the room. Garamond tensed to 
withstand an onslaught but the 
newcomers, two of whom were 
wearing field technician uniforms, 
brushed past with unseeing eyes. 

“Mr. Laker,” shouted the third 
man, who was wearing the blue 
uniform of a Starflight engineering 
officer. “You’ve got to hear this! 
You’ll never . .” 

Laker’s voice was ragged with 
fury. “Get out, Gordino. What the 
hell’s the idea of bursting in here 
like . .?” 

“You don’t understand! We’ve 
made contact with outsiders! Two 
of my technicians went over the 
hills to the west of here last night 
and they found an alien commun- 



ity — one that’s still in use!” 

Laker’s jaw and threatening fist 
sagged in unison. “What are you 
saying, Gordino? What kind of a 
story is this?” 

“These are the two men, Mr. 
Laker. They’ll tell you about it 
themselves.” 

“Two of your drunken gypsies.” 

“Please.” The taller of the tech- 
nicians raised his hand and spoke 
in an incongruous and strangely 
dignified voice. “I anticipated a 
certain degree of skepticism, so in- 
stead of returning to base im- 
mediately I waited till daylight and 
took photographs. Here they are.” 
He produced a sheaf of colored rec- 
tangles and offered them to Laker. 
Garamond pushed Napier and the 
still-dazed Mason out through the 
door and, forgetting all notion of 
fleeing, strode back to Laker and 
snatched the photographs. Other 
hands were going for them as well, 
but he emerged from the free-for- 
all with two pictures. The back- 
ground in each was the limitless 
prairie of Orbitsville. Ranged 
across the middle distance were 
pale blue rectangles that could be 
nothing other than artificial struc- 
tures. Near the base of some of the 
buildings were multicolored specks, 
so small as to be represented only 
by pinpricks of pigment beneath 
the glaze of the photographs. 

“These colored dots,” Garamond 
said to the tall technician. “Are 
they . .?” 

“All I can say is that they move. 



ORBITSVILLE 



79 




From the distance they look like 
flowers, but they move around.” 

Garamond returned his attention 
to the pictures, trying to drive his 
mind down a converging beam at 
the focus of which were the bright- 
hued molecules — as if he could 
reach an atomic level where alien 
forms would become visible, and 
beyond it a nuclear level on which 
he could look into the faces and 
eyes of the first companions man 
had found in all his years of star- 
searching. 

The reaction was a natural one, 
conditioned by centuries during 
which the sole prospect of contact- 
ing others lay in close examination 
of marks on photographic plates. 
Yet it was swept aside almost at 
once by the forces of instinct. Gara- 
mond found himself walking to- 
ward the door and was out in the 
sunlight before understanding that 
he was heading for the Starflight 
vehicle parked near the entrance. 

The figures of Napier and Mason 
were visible a short distance along 
the road, apparently on their way to 
Garamond’s house. He got into the 
crimson vehicle and examined the 
controls. The car was. brand-new, 
having been manufactured on 
board one of the spaceships specifi- 
cally for use on Orbitsville, and no 
keys were needed to energize the 
pulse-magnet engine. Garamond 
pressed the starter button and ac- 
celerated away in a cloud of dust as 
Laker and the others were coming 
out of the building. 



He ignored their shouts, gunned 
the engine for the few seconds it 
took to catch up to Napier, brought 
a heel down on the single control 
pedal and skidded the car to a halt. 
He threw open a door. Napier 
glanced back at the Starflight men 
who were now in pursuit and, with- 
out needing to be told, bundled 
Mason into the vehicle and climbed 
in after him. The engine gave a 
barely perceptible whine as Gara- 
mond switched from heel to toe 
pressure on the pedal, sending the 
car snaking along the packed earth 
of the road as the excess of power 
forced its drive wheels to slide from 
side to side. 

In less than a minute they had 
cleared the perimeter of the town- 
ship and were speeding toward the 
sunlit hills. 

T he alien settlement came into 
view as soon as the car reached 
the crest of the circular range of 
hills. It was composed of pale-blue 
rectangles shining in the distance 
like chips of ceramic. His brief 
study of the photographs had given 
Garamond the impression that the 
buildings were in a single cluster. 
In actuality they spanned the entire 
field of view and extended out 
across the plain for several kilo- 
meters. Garamond realized he was 
looking at a substantial city. It was 
a city appearing to lack a definite 
center but nevertheless large 
enough to sustain a population of a 
million or more, judging by human 



80 



GALAXY 




standards. Garamond eased back 
on the throttle, slowing the car’s 
descent. He had just picked out the 
colorful moving specks he believed 
were the first contemporaries man- 
kind had ever encountered beyond 
the biosphere of his birth planet. 

“Cliff, didn’t I hear something 
about the Starflight science teams 
duplicating our experiment with a 
reconnaissance torpedo?” Gara- 
mond frowned as he spoke, his eyes 
fixed on the glittering city. 

“I think so.” 

“I wonder if the cameras were 
activated?” 

“I doubt it. They could hardly 
have missed this.” 

Mason, who had recovered from 
his shot of sedative, stirred ex- 
citedly in the rear seat, panning 
with his scene recorder. “What are 
you going to say to these beings, 
Captain?” 

“It doesn’t matter what any of us 
say. They won’t understand it.” 

“They mightn’t even hear it,” 
Napier said. “Maybe they don’t 
have ears.” 

Garamond felt his mouth go dry. 
He had imagined this moment 
many times, with a strength of 
yearning which could not be com- 
prehended by anyone who had not 
looked into the blind orbs of a 
thousand lifeless worlds. But the 
prospect of coming face to face with 
a totally alien life form was up- 
setting his body chemistry. His 
heart began a slow, powerful 
pounding as the pale-blue city rose

final statement: 

THE BRB

Perhaps the most 
significant novel 
of 1973 
from 




higher beyond the nose of the car. 
Without conscious bidding, his foot 
eased further back on the throttle. 
The hum of the engine became all 
but inaudible. For a long moment 
there was no sound but that of the 
tough grasses of Orbitsville whip- 
ping at the vehicle’s bodywork. 

“What’s the trouble, Vance?” 
Napier’s eyes were watchful and 
sympathetic. “Arachnid reaction?” 
“I guess so.” 

“Don’t worry — I feel it too.” 
“Arachnid reaction?” Mason 
leaned forward eagerly. “What’s 
that?” 

“Ask us some other time.” 

“No, it’s all right,” Garamond 
said, glad of the opportunity to 
talk. “Do you like spiders?” 

“I can’t stand them,” Mason re- 
plied. 

“That’s fairly universal. The re- 



ORBITSVILLE

vulsion that most people get when 
they see spiders — arachnids — is so 
strong and widespread it has led to 
the theory that arachnids are not 
native to Earth. We have a sense of 
kinship, no matter how slight, with 
all creatures that originated on our 
own world, which makes them ac- 
ceptable to us even when they’re 
ugly as sin. But if the arachnid re- 
action is what some people think it 
is — loathing for something instinc- 
tively identified as of extraterres- 
trial origin — then we might be in 
trouble when we make our first 
contact with an alien race. The 
worry is that they might be intelli- 
gent and friendly, even beautiful, 
and yet might trigger hate-and-kill 
reactions in us simply because their 
shape isn’t already registered in a 
kind of checklist we inherit with 
our genes.” 

“It’s just an idea, of course,” 
Mason said. 

“Just an idea,” Garamond 
agreed. 

“What’s the probability of it be- 
ing right?” 

“Virtually zero, in my estima- 
tion. I wouldn’t ...” Garamond 
stopped speaking as the car lifted 
over a slight rise and he saw two 
bright-hued beings only a few hun- 
dred paces ahead. The aliens were 
a long way out from the perimeter 
of their city, isolated. He brought 
the car to a gradual halt. 

“I guess ... I have a feeling we 
ought to get out and walk the rest 
of the way.” 



Napier nodded and swung open 
his door. They got out, paused for a 
moment in the heat of Orbitsville’s 
constant noon, and began walking 
toward the two man-sized but un- 
earthly figures. Mason followed 
with his scene recorder. 

As the distance between them 
narrowed, Garamond began to dis- 
cern the shape of the aliens and was 
relieved to discover he was not 
afraid of them in spite of the fact 
that they were unlike anything he 
had ever imagined. The creatures 
seemed, at first, to be humanoids 
wrapped in garments covered with 
large patches of pink, yellow and 
brown. At closer range, however, 
the garments proved to be vari- 
colored fronds partly concealing 
complex asymmetrical bodies. The 
aliens did not have clearly defined 
heads, merely regions of greater 
complexity at the tops of their blunt 
forward -leaning trunks. In a wealth 
of tendrils, cavities and protuber- 
ances, the only organs Garamond 
was able to identify with any cer- 
tainty were the eyes, which resem- 
bled twin cabochons of green 
bloodstone. 

“What are they like?” Napier 
whispered. 

“I don’t know.” Garamond felt 
a similar need to relate the aliens to 
something from his past experi- 
ence. “Painted shrimps?” 

The reporter had fallen behind 
but Garamond and Napier were 
now only a few paces from the 
aliens. Both men stopped walking 



82 



GALAXY 




and stood facing the fantastic crea- 
tures, which had not moved or 
given any indication of being aware 
of the invaders. Silence encased the 
tableau like liquid glass, solidifying 
around them. The plain became a 
sun-filled lens and they were at the 
center of it, immobilized and voice- 
less. Psychic pressures built up and 
became intolerable, yet there seem- 
ed nothing to do or say. 

Garamond’s mind escaped into 
irrelevancy. It doesn't matter that 
I'm unable to think of anything to 
sav for the benefit o f posterity. Be- 
cause there's no way to communi- 
cate. No way. 

A minute endured like an age, 
and then another. 

“We’ve done our bit,” Napier 
announced finally. ‘‘Let’s go, 
Vance.” 

Garamond turned thankfully and 
they walked toward Mason, who 
backed away from them, still holo- 
recording all that was happening. 
Not until he had reached the car 
did Garamond look in the direction 
of the aliens. One of them was mov- 
ing off toward its city with a com- 
plicated ungainly gait; the other 
was standing exactly where they 
had left it. 

“I’ll drive back,” Napier said, 
climbing into the car first and ex- 
perimenting with the simplified 
controls while the others were tak- 
ing their seats. He got the vehicle 
moving, set off up the hill at an 
oblique angle. “We’ll go the long 
way around — in case a crowd is 



following our tracks out.” 

Garamond nodded, still absorb- 
ed in the two creatures on the plain. 
“There was no arachnid reaction, 
and I suppose that’s something we 
can feel good about. But I felt 
totally inadequate. There was no 
point to the confrontation at all. I 
can’t see us and them ever relating 
or interacting.” 

“I don’t know about relating, 
Vance. But there’s going to be 
plenty of interacting.” Napier 
pointed through the windshield to 
his left, where the curve of the hill 
.was falling away to reveal new ex- 
panses of prairie. The pale blue 
buildings of the alien city, instead 
of thinning out, were spread across 
the fresh vistas of grassland like 
flowers in a meadow, seemingly go- 
ing on without end. 

Mason whistled and raised his 
recorder. “Do you think it makes a 
circle outside the hills? Right 
around our base?” 

“Looks that way to me. They 
must have been here a long 
time . .” Napier allowed his words 
to trail off, but Garamond knew at 
once what he was thinking. 

Liz Lindstrom had brought a 
third of a million settlers with her 
on the very first load, and the big 
ships would soon be bringing land- 
hungry humans in batches of a full 
million or more. Interaction be- 
tween the two races was bound to 
take place in the near future, and 
on a massive scale.

I shall never forget the first time 
I saw Emmett Duckworth. He 
had not yet grown his beard then, 
and a receding chin hovered be- 
neath that beakiike proboscis. But 
the tiny close-set eyes, black and 
beady, harbored a twinkle. 

Against our wills, we were thrown 
together at the same table in the 
Faculty Dining Room at lunch one 
day. I don’t find it easy to get on 
with strangers and whenever his 
eyes brushed over mine, I stepped 
up the pace of eating and stared 
hard at the plate. He seemed 
amused by the way I dug into the 
mess. 

“You’ll eat anything,” he finally 
said. 

I reddened. 

“My mother was an awful cook,” 
I admitted. “Since I left the old 
homestead, anything is tolerable.” 
“What an amazing coincidence,” 
said Duckworth. “My mother once 
had three pies stolen off the win- 
dowsill and two-and-one-half were 
returned with a defamatory note.” 
After that the ice was broken. 
Introductions were traded. 

“I’m in Chemistry,” said Duck- 
worth. “I’m interested in genetic 
coding.” 

“I run the Computer Center,” I 
rejoined. “You may be able to use 
our services one day.” 

We strolled off afterward, and 
Duckworth started to tell me of 
some of the work he was planning. 
His face began to glow, his en- 
thusiasm waxing hotter and hotter. 



I should have guessed even then 
that he had the zeal and drive to 
win a Nobel prize, but I never 
would have guessed that he would 
ultimately earn two. 

The next time we met was at the 
Faculty Ball. President Hinkle was 
bellowing words and cigar smoke 
into Duckworth’s ear, which hung 
out like a limp conch shell. Duck- 
worth was nibbling on olives. Even 
as I watched, he seemed to put 
away at least a dozen. I wondered 
where he had got them. 

“In my coat pocket,” he said 
later, when I put the question to 
him. “Here, have one.” 

I did and my eyes began to water. 

“This thing is great,” I cried. 
“What the hell is inside it?” 

“A tiny invention of mine,” said 
Duckworth, lowering his lids 
modestly. “I figured out a way of 
sealing Martinis inside olives. It’s 
really quite a neat trick.” 

“Neat?” I said. “It’s the work of 
a genius. Have you done anything 
with onions?” 

“I’m working on that now, oddly 
enough,” mused Duckworth. “I’m 
trying to fill them with Gibsons. 
The damned things leak, though. 
Ruined the lining of one of my 
jackets.” 

“Have you thought of commer- 
cializing these ideas?” I asked. “I 
think there’s a mint of money in 
them.” 

Duckworth shuddered. 

“I couldn’t go commercial,” he 
said. “My ideas are in the public 



85 




domain. I don’t care who markets 
them.” 

“Beautifully said,” I cried, 
downing two more of his olives. I 
was beginning to feel no pain. 
“What do you do with the goddam 
pits?” 1 asked. 

Duckworth seemed to brood for 
a moment. 

“Thats a good point,” he said 
thoughtfully. “At the moment I’ve 
got’em all in my other pocket.” 

I reached over and added six 
more of my own to his sizable 
cache. He did not seem to mind. 
My recollections of what immedi- 
ately followed have grown hazy but 
I do know that I ate many more of 
Duckworth’s olives. 



T he following day, as I moved 
along the campus toward the 
Computer Laboratory, I noted sup- 
pressed smiles on many faces. 
Some persons virtually laughed out 
loud, producing sounds that threat- 
ened to tear off the roof of my hy- 
persensitized head. Even the quiet 
murmur of the tape decks sounded 
like anchors being hauled aboard 
an ocean liner. I cursed Duckworth 
under my breath and vowed to have 
nothing more to do with him. But 
Fate took its own hand in subvert- 
ing my resolve. 

Interestingly enough, it was Pres- 
ident Hinkle himself who was the 
deus ex machina. I found a brief 
note on my desk summoning me to 
his august office. It was awash with 



mementos of his long and distin- 
guished scientific career; the walls 
were virtually obscured by scrolls 
*md engraved plaques. The air was 
redolent of cigar smoke being 
amply replenished by a fat black 
pseudo-Havana in the President’s 
mouth. Hinkle was an inveterate 
namedropper, and between linger- 
ing puffs he threw out the names 
Albert and Franklin. I knew he was 
referring to Einstein and Roosevelt 
but a mention of Sir Isaac threw 
me. Surely, I thought, he can’t 
mean Newton? 

It was not the President’s way to 
get directly to the point. So I sat 
there, trying to guess surnames of 
his confidants, until he made men- 
tion of my computer. 

“Use it for what?” I gasped, 
inadvertently inhaling a noxious 
gob of the fouled air. 

“To keep inventory of our chemi- 
cal supplies,” said the President. 
“As you know, the Chemistry De- 
partment is my first love and I keep 
a fond eye on its doings. My 
protege, Emmett Duckworth, sug- 
gested you might be happy to 
eliminate the under-utilization of 
your facility.” 

My eyebrows shot up. 

“Under-utilization?” I cried. 
“That’s outrageous! If you examine 
our log book, you’ll find that 
people are signed up for months 
ahead on a round-the-clock basis.” 

President Hinkle waved his bony 
hands. 

“See Duckworth,” he said, “I’ve 



86 



GALAXY 




put the matter into his hands.” 

I knew that the discussion was 
over. So I thanked the President, 
and with fire snorting out of my 
nostrils, set out to find Duckworth. 
He was at his workbench in the 
Chemistry Building, tinkering with 
a Bunsen burner that refused to 
light. 

“Incredible,” he said to me, not 
realizing that at the moment I 
hated his guts. “I have a fantasti- 
cally sophisticated experiment go- 
ing astray because this blasted 
piece of plumbing is clogged up.” 

I came directly to the point. 
“Why,” 1 bellowed, “are you 
feeding this drivel to Hinkle about 
under-utilization of my computer?” 
Duckworth beamed at me. 

“Oh, that,” he said amiably. “I 
had to tell him something. Of 
course, I have a much better reason 
for wanting time on your souped-up 
calculator. But I looked over your 
log book and it was clear that if I 
went through normal channels, I 
would have to wait years.” 

“Months,” I conceded. “Why 
can’t you wait your turn like every- 
one else?” 

“I have a great idea, and I simply 
must find out immediately if it’s 
feasible or not,” said Duckworth. 
“Come inside. I’ll show you what 
it’s all about.” 

Reluctantly I trudged after him. 
The shine on the serge cloth of his 
ancient trousers was almost mirror- 
like. Following him into his office, I 
was hit by the stench of stale cigar 



smoke. Duckworth caught my 
wince. 

“Aha,” he said. “You’ve suffered 
this before.” 

“Just a few minutes ago in the 
President’s office.” 

“Then you ought to be in sym- 
pathy with my goals,” said Duck- 
worth. “Nominally this is Hinkle’s 
lab. Nominally I am his assistant. 
He comes in quite frequently to see 
what I’m doing — and pumps cigar 
smoke at an unbelievable rate.” 

“I know,” I said. “What has that 
got to do with my computer?” 

“I’ve been tinkering with the 
molecular structure of tobacco,” 
said Duckworth. 

“Sounds like as good a place to 
tinker as any,” I said. 

Duckworth glared at me. 

“Don’t be patronizing,” he 
snarled. “I may be on the verge of a 
dramatic breakthrough. I believe I 
have synthesized what I call heavy 
tobacco!” 

1 suppressed a yawn. 

“Outside of increasing the in- 
come of tobacco farmers, I can’t 
see what advantage that would 
have.” 

Duckworth shook his head im- 
patiently. 

“Don’t you see, man?” he asked 
plaintively. “It would mean that 
the smoke, instead of filling the air 
with a blue-gray haze, would 
tumble to the ground and lie there, 
waiting to be removed en masse. ” 

I gasped. 

“Brilliant,” I said. “It would 



WHERE THERE’S SMOKE 



87 




save many a sensitive nostril from 
hours of torture. Think of trains 
and planes, for example.” 

“I don’t care about trains and 
planes,” said Duckworth. “I just 
want to clean up the air in the 
chemistry lab. And if you write the 
proper program for me, I’d like to 
check my atomic weight calcula- 
tions on the computer.” 

‘‘It undoubtedly will earn me 
eternal enemies,” I said. “But I’ll 
do it for you, Duckworth.” 

I spent a day or two writing the 
program and another day de- 
bugging it. Then were were ready to 
roll. Duckworth stood in front of 
the high-speed printer like an ex- 
pectant father. As the lines of print- 
out spewed from the exit slot, his 
face lit up. 

“The model works,” he cried. 
“Heavy tobacco will become a 
reality!” 

“You’ve got to market it, Duck- 
worth,” I urged. “Give the royalties 
to the University, if you insist. But 
heavy tobacco will make millions.” 
“I’ll apply for a patent,” he 
agreed, “and assign the rights to 
the University. But you’re jumping 
the gun. Next my friend, Prof. 
Schwartz in Plant Pathology, has to 
grow some of the stuff in his green- 
house.” 

I was hazy about practical botany 
but the passage of time made 
some of the pitfalls more meaning- 
ful to me. The first blooms, for 
example, were carried off by blight 



and a more sturdy mutant had to 
be bred. Still, after six months of 
painstaking work on the part of 
Professor Schwartz, the first rich 
leaves of heavy tobacco were at 
hand. After the appropriate sun- 
drying and curing, the leaves were 
taken to an old cigarmaker and ten 
fine panatelas were produced. 

“You may have the honor of 
smoking the first one,” said Duck- 
worth, proffering the cigar to me. 

I gingerly bit off the end and, 
holding the thing with both hands, 
accepted a light. The taste was 
pleasant, the aroma tolerable, and 
to my delight the smoke tumbled 
directly to the floor and lay there. 

“My God! It truly is heavy!” I 
cried. 

And then it hit me. 

“Do you realize what you have 
here, Duckworth? You may have 
the answer to the smoking blight. 
This smoke is so heavy, no one will 
be able to inhale it. If used in cigar- 
ettes, it would cut heart disease, 
lung cancer, emphysema and God 
knows what else!” 

Duckworth rubbed at his reced- 
ing chin. 

“You may be right at that,” he 
said. “But first let me offer a few of 
these to President Hinkle.” 

I was present when the President 
first lit up. His pleasure was even 
greater than mine had been. He 
showered praises on Duckworth. 
By the time I eased out of the 
office, both were ankle-deep in 
heavy tobacco smoke.

GALAXY 




I saw Duckworth again the 
following week. He seemed haggard 
and not at all disposed to trade 
chitchat. 

“Have you started the patent 
proceedings yet?” I asked. 

“No. What’s more. I’m not going 
to,” said Duckworth gloomily. 

1 could not believe my ears. 

“You must be kidding,” I said. 
“To me it’s the idea of the century. 
It can’t miss!” 

Duckworth sighed. Then he dis- 
appeared into his laboratory, soon 
came back pushing a hand-truck 
loaded with bundles. 

“Follow me,” he said. 

“But Duckworth — ” 

“Please. It must be done. No 
choice.” 

I obeyed his plea, and we took 
turns maneuvering the inordinately 
heavy load to the river. By using 
our combined strengths, we tipped 
the bundles into the water. They 
sank without a trace. 

“Duckworth — why? Are you out 
of your mind?” 

Instead of answering, he said, 
“Have you seen the President?” 

I scratched my head absently. 

“Not lately. But then, I don’t see 
him that often.” 

“If you did wish to see him,” 
Duckworth, “you would have to go 
to Emerson Memorial Hospital.” 

“The hospital? What’s wrong 
with him?” 

“Heavy tobacco,” said Duck- 
worth. 

“Does it have toxic properties?” 



“The President likes to smoke in 
bed,” said Duckworth, ignoring my 
question. “Like many bed-smokers, 
he fell asleep.” 

“He was burned in a fire!” I ex- 
claimed. 

“Not exactly,” said Duckworth. 
“He was almost asphyxiated.” 

“By what?” 

“The smoke lay on his mouth 
and nose, stopping his oxygen in- 
take. If his wife hadn’t chanced to 
xome in and see the blue pallor of 
his skin, there would have been a 
new president of this university.” 

I shook my head sadly. “What a 
pity!” What a pity that his wife had 
rescued him, I meant. 

Duckworth did not get my point. 
“Yes,” he said. “Heavy tobacco 
could have been a boon to man- 
kind. But the stuff is too risky to 
use.” 

“I suppose so.” I clapped him on 
the shoulder. “What the hell. You 
can’t win’em all.” 

His face brightened. “There’s 
one good outcome. President 
Hinkle says he’s giving up cigars for 
good.” 

“What a sacrifice,” I said sarcas- 
tically. “Why don’t you try next for 
a smokeless tobacco? Then Hinkle 
and all the poor fellows like him 
could enjoy the stuff without 
bothering other people?” 

“Smokeless tobacco?” A gleam 
came into Duckworth’s eye. 

He turned, and started walking 
back eagerly toward his labora- 
tory. ★ 



WHERE THERE’S SMOKE 



89 





JOE HALDEMAN 



W ith each step your boot heel 
cracks through the sun-dried 
crust and your foot hesitates, drops 



90 



through an inch of red talcum 
powder, and then you draw it back 
up with another crackle. Fifty men 
marching in a line through this 
desert and they sound like a big 
bowl of breakfast cereal. 

Jacob held the laser projector in 
his left hand and rubbed his right 
in the dirt. Then he switched hands 
and rubbed his left in the dirt. The 
plastic handles got very slippery 
after you’d sweated on them all day 
long, and you didn’t want the damn 
thing to squirt out of your grip 
when you were rolling and stum- 
bling and crawling your way to the 
enemy, and you couldn’t use the 
strap, noplace off the parade 
ground; goddamn slide-rule jockey 
figured out where to put it, too 
high, take the damn thing off if you 
could. Take the goddamn helmet 
off too, if you could. No matter you 
were safer with it on. They said. 
And they were pretty strict, es- 
pecially about the helmets. 

“Look happy, Jacob.” Sergeant 
Melford was always all smile and 
bounce before a battle. During a 
battle, too. He smiled at the tangle- 
wire and beamed at his men while 
they picked their way through it — 
if you go too fast you get tripped 
and if you go too slow you get 
burned — and he had a sad smile 
when one of his men got zeroed and 
a shriek a happy shriek when they 
first saw the enemy and glee when 
an enemy got zeroed and nothing 
but smiles smiles smiles through 
the whole sorry mess. “If he didn't 



smile, just once,” young-old Addi- 
son told Jacob, a long time ago, 
“Just once he cried or frowned, 
there would be fifty people waiting 
for the first chance to zero that son 
of a bitch.” And Jacob asked why 
and he said, “You just take a good 
look inside yourself the next time 
you follow that crazy son of a bitch 
into hell and you come back and 
tell me how you felt about him.” 

Jacob wasn’t stupid, that day or 
this one, and he did keep an inside 
eye on what was going on under his 
helmet. What old Sergeant Melford 
did for him was mainly to make 
him glad that he wasn’t crazy too, 
and no matter how bad things got, 
at least Jacob wasn’t enjoying it like 
that crazy laughing grinning old 
Sergeant Melford. 

He wanted to tell Addison and 
ask him why sometimes you were 
really scared or sick and you would 
look up and see Melford laughing 
his crazy ass off, standing over 
some steaming roasted body, and 
you’d have to grin, too, was it just 
so insane horrible or? Addison 
might have been able to tell Jacob 
but Addison took a low one and got 
hurt bad in both legs and the groin 
and it was a long time before he 
came back and then he wasn’t 
young-old any more but just old. 
And he didn’t say much any more. 

With both his hands good and 
dirty, for a good grip on the plastic 
handles, Jacob felt more secure and 
he smiled back at Sergeant Mel- 
ford. 



THE PRIVATE WAR OF PVT. JACOB 



91 




“Gonna be a good one, Sarge.” 
It didn’t do any good to say any- 
thing else, like it’s been a long 
march and why don’t we rest a 
while before we hit them, Sarge or, 
I’m scared and sick and if I’m 
gonna die I want it at the very first, 
Sarge: no. Crazy old Melford would 
be down on his hunkers next to you 
and give you a couple of friendly 
punches and josh around and flash 
those white teeth until you were 
about to scream or run but instead 
you wound up saying, “Yeah Sarge, 
gonna be a good one.” 

We most of us figured that what 
made him so crazy was just that 
he’d been in this crazy war so long, 
longer than anybody could remem- 
ber anybody saying he remembered; 
and he never got hurt while platoon 
after platoon got zeroed out from 
under him by ones and twos and 
whole squads. He never got hurt 
and maybe that bothered him, not 
that any of us felt sorry for the 
crazy son of a bitch. 

W esley tried to explain it like 
this: “Sergeant Melford is an 
improbability locus.” Then he tried 
to explain what a locus was and 
Jacob didn’t really catch it, and he 
tried to explain what an improba- 
bility was, and that seemed pretty 
simple but Jacob couldn’t see what 
it all had to do with math. Wesley 
was a good talker though, and he 
might have one day been able to 
clear it up but he tried to run 
through the tanglewire, you’d think 



not even a civilian would try to do 
that, and he fell down and the little 
metal bugs ate his face. 

It was twenty or maybe twenty- 
five battles later, who keeps track, 
when Jacob realized that not only 
did old Sergeant Melford never get 
hurt, but he never killed any of the 
enemy either. He just ran around 
singing out orders and being happy 
and every now and then he’d shoot 
off his projector but he always shot 
high or low or the beam was too 
broad. Jacob wondered about it but 
by this time he was more afraid, in 
a way, of Sergeant Melford than he 
was of the enemy, so he kept his 
mouth shut and he waited for some- 
one else to say something about it. 

Finally Cromwell, who had come 
into the platoon only a couple of 
weeks after Jacob, noticed that Ser- 
geant Melford never seemed to zero 
anybody and he had this theory 
that maybe the crazy old son of a 
bitch was a spy for the other side. 
They had fun talking about that for 
a while, and then Jacob told them 
about the old improbability locus 
theory, and one of the new guys 
said he sure is an impertubable 
locust all right, and they all had a 
good laugh, which was good be- 
cause Sergeant Melford came by 
and joined in after Jacob told him 
what was so funny, not about the 
improbability locus, but the old 
joke about how do you make a hor- 
mone? You don’t pay her. Crom- 
well laughed like there was no to- 
morrow and for Cromwell there 



92 



GALAXY 




wasn’t even any sunset, because he 
went across the perimeter to take a 
crap and got caught in a squeezer 
matrix. 

The next battle was the first time 
the enemy used the drainer field, 
and of course the projectors didn’t 
work and the last thing a lot of the 
men learned was that the light 
plastic stock made a damn poor 
weapon against a long knife, of 
which the enemy had plenty. Jacob 
lived because he got in a lucky kick, 
aimed for the groin but got the 
kneecap, and while the guy was 
hopping around trying to stay 
upright he dropped his knife and 
Jacob picked it up and gave the guy 
a new orifice, eight inches wide and 
just below the navel. 

The platoon took a lot of zeros 
and had to fall back, which they 
did very fast because the tanglewire 
didn’t work in a drainer field, 
either. They left Addison behind, 
sitting back against a crate with his 
hands in his lap and a big drooly 
red grin not on his face. 

With Addison gone, no other pri- 
vate had as much combat time as 
Jacob. When they rallied back at 
the neutral zone, Sergeant Melford 
took Jacob aside and wasn’t really 
smiling at all when he said: “Jacob, 
you know that now if anything 
happens to me, you’ve got to take 
over the platoon. Keep them spread 
out and keep them advancing, and 
most of all, keep them happy.” 

Jacob said, “Sarge, I can tell 
them to keep spread out and I 



think they will, and all of them 
know enough to keep pushing 
ahead, but how can I keep them 
happy when I’m never very happy 
myself, not when you’re not 
around.” 

That smile broadened and turned 
itself into a laugh. You crazy old 
son of a bitch, Jacob thought and 
because he couldn’t help himself, 
he laughed too. “Don’t worry about 
that,” Sergeant Melford said. 
“That’s the kind of thing that takes 
care of itself when the time comes.” 

T he platoon practiced more and 
more with knives and clubs and 
how to use your hands and feet but 
they still had to carry the projectors 
into combat because, of course, the 
enemy could turn off the drainer 
field whenever he wanted to. Jacob 
got a couple of scratches and a 
piece of his nose cut off, but the 
medic put some cream on it and it 
grew back. The enemy started 
using bows and arrows so the pla- 
toon had to carry shields, too, but 
that wasn’t too bad after they de- 
signed one that fit right over the 
projector, held sideways. One 
squad learned how to use bows and 
arrows back at the enemy and 
things got as much back to normal 
as they had ever been. 

Jacob never knew exactly how 
many battles he had fought as a 
private, but it was exactly forty-one. 
And actually, he wasn’t a private at 
the end of the forty-first. 

Since they got the archer squad, 



THE PRIVATE WAR OF PVT. JACOB

Sergeant Melford had taken to 
standing back with them, laughing 
and shouting orders at the platoon 
and every now and then loosing an 
arrow that always landed on a bare 
piece of ground. But this particular 
battle (Jacob’s forty-first) had been 
going pretty poorly, with the initial 
advance stopped and then pushed 
back almost to the archers; and 
then a new enemy force breaking 
out on the other side of the archers. 

Jacob’s squad maneuvered be- 
tween the archers and the new 
enemy soldiers and Jacob was fight- 
ing right next to Sergeant Melford, 
fighting pretty seriously while old 
Melford just laughed his fool head 
off, crazy son of a bitch. Jacob felt 
that split-second funny feeling and 
ducked and a heavy club whistled 
just over his head and bashed the 
side of Sergeant Melford’s helmet 
and sheared the top of his helmet 
off just as neat as you snip the end 
off a soft-boiled egg. Jacob fell to 
his knees and watched the helmet 
full of stuff twirl end over end in 
back of the archers and he won- 
dered why there were little glass 
marbles and cubes inside the gray- 
blue blood-streaked mushy stuff 
and then everything just went 

Inside a mountain of crystal 
under a mountain of rock, a tiny 
piezoelectric switch, sixty-four 
molecules in a cube, flipped over to 
the OFF position and the following 
transaction took place at just less 
than the speed of light: 



UNIT 1001 100101 1MELFORD 
DEACTIVATED. 

SWITCH UNIT 1101011100 
JACOB TO CATALYST STATUS. 

(SWITCHING COMPLETED) 

ACTIVATE AND INSTRUCT 
UNIT 1 10101 1100JACOB. 

and came back again just like that. 
Jacob stood up and looked around. 
The same old sun-baked plain, but 
everybody but him seemed to be 
dead. Then he checked and the 
ones that weren’t obviously zeroed 
were still breathing a bit. And, 
thinking about it, he knew why. He 
chuckled. 

He stepped over the collapsed 
archers and picked up Melford’s 
bleedy skull-cap. He inserted the 
blade of a knife between the helmet 
and the hair, shorting out the in- 
duction tractor that held the helmet 
on the head and served to. pick up 
and transmit signals. Letting the 
helmet drop to the ground, he care- 
fully bore the grisly balding bowl 
over to the enemy’s crapper. Know- 
ing exactly where to look, he fished 
out all the bits and pieces of crystal 
and tossed them down the smelly 
hole. Then he took the unaug- 
mented brain back to the helmet 
and put it back the way he had 
found it. He returned to his position 
by Melford’s body. 

The stricken men began to stir 
and a few of the most hardy 
wobbled to their hands and knees. 

Jacob threw back his head and 
laughed and laughed. ★

A kind reader name of Carleton 
Palmer writes: “Your two 
pages of travels w'ere, for me, a vi- 
carious ‘Alice in Wonderland’ trip 
through realms to which I have no 
access; an excursion tour about 
which you could write much more . 
The activities of the Sagans and 
Minskys influence us all.” 

Sobeit; and believe me, I do 
enjoy sharing these excursions. 
Again 1 write on the road, this time 
from North Carolina and a most ex- 
citing week. But I’ll tell you first 
about an adventure I had two 
weeks before this one. 

Summoned to speak at North- 
land College in Wisconsin, 1 left 



L.A. clad in cord pants and jacket 
and a short-sleeved shirt; not hav- 
ing seen snow for three years or so it 
did not occur to me until, in the 
glide-path into Milwaukee when 
the skipper said over the intercom 
that the ground temperature was 
27°, that 1 really don’t have sense 
enough to come in out of the rain. I 
scuttled chattering to the departure 
point of my connecting flight north 
where the sign said it would arrive 
at 6:30, depart at 6:35, and a 727 
would be at the same gate at 6:45. 
Sure enough, here came what 
looked, among the hissing super- 
jets, like an escaped New Jersey 
‘squitobug’, with two of those 



95 




things that go round and round in 
front; remember those? 

I chattered aboard and we voom- 
ed off. It seats about a baker’s 
dozen and the center aisle is so 
narrow that if your left foot is first, 
it will be first all the way. And now 
that I’ve done my funnies' I’ll say 
that a Beechcraft 99 is a twin turbo- 
jet, comfortable, fast, and unbe- 
lievably quiet. This one was licens- 
ed to fly day, night, instrument and 
in icing conditions. Not only that; 
once airborne, the captain got on 
the horn and said, “There’s a 
goodie bag back there. Some of you 
know where it is. sg go to it.” The 
passenger nearest the door broke 
open a large styrofoam picnic chest, 
and chips, slabs of Wisconsin 
cheese, shrimp sandwiches and 
bottles of champagne were passed 
up and back over people’s shoul- 
ders. 

It came to me that maybe this 
country was not all that cold after 
all. and I was right: Item: I was met 
at the airport and whisked to a bar 
where we awaited mine host, Dr. 
Daniel Small, who was playing 
basketball. His French wife, born 
in New Hebrides and raised in 
Madagascar, is enchanting. When 
at last he arrived and we left for the 
motel, he did the Walter Raleigh 
bit — wound me up in his coat, his 
gloves and a seven-foot scarf and 
drove me there in his shirt sleeves. 
(By then it was two-degrees Fahren- 
heit.) Item: In the morning the 
motel lady wouldn’t let me go with- 



out a hot breakfast with home- 
made bread. Item: as lavish a 
dinner as I have ever put into my 
entire mouth (to steal a phrase I 
wish was mine) in a gourmet res- 
taurant, unbelievably placed in a 
town that passed its peak (25,000) 
at the turn of the century and now 
has a fifth of that. Item: a reception 
after my day’s work at which, in my 
honor, wassail was committed until 
2:30 a.m., and then, after an ad- 
venture with a car breakdown in 
which my mustache froze from end 
to end (it was then 10° below) and 
our arrival at the motel at 4, Dr. 
Small was back at 6 to drive me to 
the airport. Finally, Item: the 
motel lady, knowing I would leave 
very early, had left me a thermos of 
hot coffee and a bag full of sand- 
wiches, cookies, and home-made 
nut bread. 

No, friends, there on the shores 
of Lake Superior, with its thou- 
sands of off-shore ice-fishing shacks 
and snowmobiles howling all over, 
it is not cold country. About North- 
land College, liberal arts, attend- 
ance around 550, I’ll say that no- 
where is there a more attentive and 
responsive bunch, and yes, they 
have a science fiction course. 

N ow I do own a sheepskin jacket 
and you can bet I brought it 
with me to Elon College, hard by 
Burlington, where the panty-hose 
come from, and across a few thou- 
sand tobacco fields from Greens- 
boro, where every single day has

GALAXY 




been between 80 and 90° and the 
dogwood, the forsythia, and the 
daffodils bloom till it hurts. It is 
beautiful country, from the air es- 
pecially. It emanates strength — 
strong earth reds, browns, and 
blacks in the creek-bottoms, with a 
pressing green haze of growth at 
this time of year. The four-day sym- 
posium was on “Science, science 
fiction, and religion: three modes 
of openness to the future”. 

My fellow speakers were Dr. 
Sedhev Gupta, who teaches film at 
the U. of Waterloo in Canada; Dr. 
George Schweitzer of the U. of 
Tennessee and Dr. Clark Thomp- 
son from Salem College. Dr. Gupta 
(who has, by the way, one of the 
most beautiful faces I have ever 
seen) brought film: Cosmic Egg. 
Cosmic Zoom, two extraordinary 
Pas de deux, and a high-voltage 
Czech animation called The Hand. 
and spoke about time and con- 
sciousness. Dr. Schweitzer, whose 
presentation is evangelistic but 
whose message is most certainly 
not, drew a surprising verbal graph 
of human evolution and its extra- 
polations. Dr. Thompson introduc- 
ed us — me anyway — to the work of 
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and I 
got a book list from him and am 
prepared to dive in up to the heels. 
For my part, I chuntered on as 
usual, and incidentally read a pro- 
vocative passage from a letter from 
a recent staff-member of Gataxy/If 
Albert Dytch, which I mention to 
show you how you and the maga- 



zine and these audiences stimulate, 
restimulate, and feed back. What 
is coming out from all over is a 
rising pressure toward self-orienta- 
tion and a need for true under- 
standing of the nature of reality. I 
saw this all through the symposium 
and I see it increasingly in the new 
books. 

And oh that Southern hospital- 
ity. Jim and Betty Gerow literally 
gave me the key to a mansion and 
said It’s yours; there was a recep- 
tion every night and a lunch every 
day and young Dr. Sullivan and his 
beautiful Linda never stopped look- 
ing for things they could do for us. 

Well now: books. 

Stand by for a couple of big ones. 



U rsula k. le guinn has done it 
again. The Dispossessed, sub- 
titled An Ambiguous Utopia. (Har- 
per and Row, 358 pp., $7.95) is so 
many things that it’s difficult to 
know where to start. If is, of 
course, a beautifully written, beau- 
tifully composed book. Further, it 
performs one of sfs prime func- 
tions, which is to create another 
kind of social system to see how it 
would work. Or if it would work. 
Then, it's the. biography of a man, 
his life and his mind, his convic- 
tions and his willingness to test 
them. You are not that man nor am 
I, but such is the le Guin magic 
that you must empathize with him, 
participate with him in his testings 
and his agonies and his losses and

triumphs. Here’s the frame: From 
an earth very like ours, some rebels 
escape to a twin planet to create 
their own, better society. But the 
planet is twin only in size; it is a 
parched wilderness, and life is a 
struggle, for every foothold, every 
spoonful. They build a ‘pure’ cul- 
ture — no money, property, taxes or 
government. Life on the home 
planet proceeds, decays, yet 
flourishes in its own mulch. Com- 
munication between the two cul- 
tures is sparse, yet the scientists on 
both worlds get through to one an- 
other, and at last the man is able to 
make the journey back to the home 
of his rebel forebears. He takes no- 
thing with him but ideas. He brings 
back, ultimately, only ideas. His 
going and coming change both 
worlds radically and irreversibly. 
Within this frame is a mosaic of 
characterization and event which 
you will never forget. Bow your 
head a little and be grateful: le 
Guin has written another book. Let 
me spell that again: another Book. 

D oris piserchia first hit me in 
the eye with the obverse of an 
Ace double. Now she comes into 
her own with a fine, far-out novel, 
The Star Rider (Bantam, 224 pp., 
$1.25). It’s something like tele- 
kinesis, and something like Bester’s 
“jaunting”. But this girl, ^member 
of a space-dwelling tribe of no- 
mads, and her mount, a kind of a 
dog sort of a horse, can leap 
through space from planet to 



planetoid, carrying with them at- 
mosphere in a self-created force- 
field. It takes some writing to make 
one believe (the technical term is 
‘suspend disbelief) in such a psy- 
chic symbiote, but a writer like 
Piserchia does it with the back of 
her hand. 

This girl in the story is something 
else. She’s tough, resourceful, 
mean as cat-piss and desperately 
lonely. She meets one of her own 
kind who comes on like Superman 
in a Lochinvar suit, turns out to be 
a traitor and a twit, and ultimately 
reveals that he is hoeing his own 
row the same as she is, and finding 
it no easier. 1 once described Piser- 
chia’s writing as muscular; I do it 
again. She goes into what she does, 
and comes out of it very clean, very 
strong. Get this one. 

O n hand and briefly noted: 

Ursula le Guinn’s great A 
Wizard ofEarthsea is out in paper- 
back (Ace, 205 pp., 95c) ... a 
pleasant curiosity is Mary Shelley’s, 
Christofer Isherwood’s, Don Ba- 
chardy’s teleplay, in script form, of 
Frankenstein, the True Story (Avon

that the second volume of Walt 
Lee’s magnificent Reference Guide

O ne unexpected pleasure: Vol. 1 
No. 1 of Red Planet Earth 
(Craig Strete, R. R. 1, Box 208, 
Celina, Ohio 45822, 50c) which 
calls itself “A magazine of Ameri- 
can Indian Science Fiction.” In his 
gutsy editorial, Strete writes “No 



other culture has a solider base for 
writing science fiction than Ameri- 
can Indians. We are one of the few 
races which have actually experi- 
enced an alien invasion. They were 
called pilgrims. They came in 
strange craft, the like of which we 
had never seen before . They 
had a superior technology, a 
strange language, hideous white 
skin, multi-colored eyes, and hair 
of all imaginable colors . They 
had . alien values and emotions. 
They spread across the land, elimi- 
nating all life-forms not essential to 
their culture.” And Strete makes a 
further point for which I bless him. 
Even this paleface has been bugged 
by the homogenized image of the 
movies and TV, a sort of plains- 
riding Algonquin. Strete says, 
“When you’re talking about In- 
dians, you’re talking about 3400 
different cultures and that’s just 
North America. So what the hell is 
an Indian? What you’re talking 
about is several thousand different 
levels of culture, several different 
degrees of civilization and hun- 
dreds of different languages . 
An Ojibway is as alien to a Sioux's 
culture as is an Italian. So, here are 
some Indians writing about In- 
dians. They don’t write like white 
people because they aren’t like 
white people. They speak with bits 
and pieces of other cultures running 
across their tongues. It may sound 
strange.' If so, we blame it on the 
aliens, and it isn’t us, it’s them.”

THE GLITCH 

The entire world was put in the care of 
a single machine — and when it broke down . 



JAMES BUSH 
(with L. Jerome Stanton) 




W hen the construction of he planned to be far away when 
ultimac began, Ivor Har- it did. Unfortunately, it is in the 
rigan could have told World Gov- very nature of a glitch that it strikes 
ernment what would happen and without warning. So planning to be 



100 



somewhere else at the time is about 
as useless as trying to enforce the 
Ten Commandments. 

He would not have been listened 
to, anyhow, since at the start of the 
project he was only twenty. A fairly 
advanced age considering that even 
then most people got their Ph.D.’s 
by twelve ae. — but a long way from 
seniority in the computer-servicing 
business, let alone in Government. 
Not that he did not try; which, as it 
turned out, was his peripateia. He 
had a social conscience of sorts, 
strong enough at least to get him 
through to Abdullah Powell. 

Powell was also a computer man, 
and senior enough to be involved in 
the ultimac project itself. The 
trouble, Ivor quickly found, was 
that computer designers and com- 
puter servicing engineers are two 
quite different breeds of cat. Sitting 
in his plush Novoe Washingtongrad 
office, Powell uttered one of the 
most venerable of Famous Last 
Words; 

“Forget it. Nothing can go 
wrong.” 

“But Dr. Powell, things are al- 
ways going wrong. I know. Things 
going wrong is what I make my 
living at.” 

“Not much longer, I’m afraid,” 
Powell said, waving a perfumed 
cigar and assuming a visionary ex- 
pression. This gave him the twin 
advantages of looking skyward 
rather than at Ivor and of causing 
his double chins almost to merge. 
“You don’t understand the total 



scope of this venture, Ivor. Once 
ultimac is finished, there’ll no 
longer be such a thing as an indi- 
vidual, independent computer, ul- 
timac will run the whole show. It 
will be self-monitoring and self- 
correcting. It will be tied in to every 
other computer in the world, and 
will monitor and repair them, too. 
It will have the ultimate in fail-safe 
systems. With outlets in every home 
and business, it will manage the 
economy of the world, construct 
curricula, diagnose illnesses, pre- 
dict earthquakes, ground-control 
all spaceflights ...” Powell had 
run out of breath. “And,” he said 
when he had gotten it back, his face 
glowing, “it will instantaneously 
poll the best educated populace in 
history on each and every decision. 
Think of that, Ivor — true, work- 
able democracy at last, on a world- 
wide scale! And, of course, under a 
logics design completely subject to 
the I. A. ’s.” 

The I.A.’s were the Laws of Ro- 
botics, named after a science popu- 
larizer who had once predicted that 
if computers ever took over the 
management of the world, they 
would probably do a better job of it 
than man had and might even suc- 
ceed man in the course of evolu- 
tion. No record of the I.A.’s re- 
mains now, but hints and guess- 
work suggest they might be recon- 
structed thus: 

I. No robot shall harm any 
human being, or take any action 
that might harm any human being. 



101 




II. A robot shall protect itself at 
all times, unless such protection 
conflicts with the first law. 

III. A robot must obey any order 
given it by a human being, unless 
that order conflicts with the first 
two laws. 

IV. In any situation that con- 
flicts with the first three laws, a 
robot must either immobilize itself 
and report later for repair, or self- 
destruct. 

V. In all other situations, a robot 
must think for itself under the over- 
all rule: “Anything not compulsory 
is forbidden. ” 

“But Dr. Powell, we’re not talk- 
ing about robots. We’re talking 
about computers. The I.A.’s don’t 
work with them and never did. Be- 
sides, we don’t have anything even 
vaguely like robots yet and maybe 
never will — ” 

“Now, Ivor, calm down, please. 
Technical men should not be sub- 
ject to hysteria. I quite understand 
that you’re worried about the loss 
of your livelihood, but I’m sure you 
can be restrained. Men of your 
caliber are hard to find.” 

This was untrue. Since the argu- 
ment was obviously getting no- 
where, however, Ivor left and tried 
a different tack: persuasion of 
senior men in his own branch of the 
field. That only got him nowhere in 
a different direction. The highest 
colleague he could reach was Enoch 
Amin, who had his own views: 

“We’ll never be redundant, Ivor. 
Powell doesn’t know it, but ulti- 



mac really is the ultimate in oppor- 
tunities for us. Every computer in 
the world tied into it, and every one 
of them on the edge of taking sick 
overnight — to say nothing of the 
master machine itself! It’s the 
design engineers like Powell who’ll 
be put out of business. We service 
engineers will be rushed off our 
feet.” 

“But the whole damn system is 
supposed to be homeostatic — self- 
correcting!” 

“All the more jobs for us. Did 
you ever run into a self-monitoring 
computer that worked? We’ll be 
rushing all over the world, trying to 
find out which component went 
wrong where.” Amin stood up ec- 
statically, which, since he was half 
a foot taller than Ivor, made him 
seem as though he were about to go 
into orbit. “And as for the Big One, 
my God, what an opportunity! Be- 
lieve me, Ivor, we’ll wind up the 
secret masters of the whole system. 
Wallowing in luxury, if we can just 
find the time off for it. And, of 
course, if we keep our focus firmly 
on the I.A.’s.” 

Ivor knew well enough that the 
I.A.’s to which Amin was referring 
were entirely different from those 
Powell had invoked and, further- 
more, constituted a trade secret. 
Neither set of laws comforted Ivor. 
He foresaw trouble on a massive 
scale. Yet neither Amin nor Powell 
could talk about it except in terms 
of keeping their jobs. 

As mentioned, Ivor had a rudi- 



102 



GALAXY 




mentary social conscience. But it 
was now clear to him that he had no 
pull, no leverage. He had gone as 
high as he could in the two direc- 
tions open to him. No, he saw no 
choice but to go back to doing what 
he had been trained to do. In prep- 
aration for the difficulties to come 
he also fired his wives and his cats, 
gave up drinking and, insofar as 
was possible, eating, and reduced 
his hobbies to the single one of sav- 
ing his money at the highest interest 
rate he could find. That, specifi- 
cally, was paid by a bank whose 
computer, unbeknownst to anyone 
but himself, thought that the 
square root of 4.7 was 0.68581425, 
which was 0.0011488 too high. 

He did not know why it thought 
so and had no intention of trying to 
find out. Nor could he have, for 
that particular kind of bias was be- 
yond his competence. But the effect 
of filling this parameter in this way 
upon the machine’s way of com- 
pounding interest was satisfying 
enough so that six years later he 
was again eating well enough to 
gain a little weight back. 



I n fact, the whole next decade 
was idyllic for almost everyone. 
ultimac was built, squatting 
squarely across Niagara Falls — no 
lesser cooling system could have 
carried away its entropy loss alone. 
The gigantic building and its slave 
computers did everything they were 
supposed to do, and perfectly. By 



the end of that decade if ultimac 
had decided to run the Amazon 
River backward for twenty-four 
hours, or convert world math to the 
base twelve, or revive the railroad 
system, nobody would have argued. 
The decisions always worked — out 
to a margin of error so many de- 
cimal places to the right as to make 
Planck’s Constant look like a whole 
number, and a rather small one at 
that. 

So ultimac put computermen of 
all stripes out of business, and all 
but a few politicians, too. Ivor did 
not mind that. Immediately after 
his one abortive venture into poli- 
tics, he had taken the precaution of 
cutting off his bank’s computer 
from ultimac (under the guise of a 
routine check within his own sub- 
specialty) and as a result could also 
begin thinking about again taking 
in one cat (though, certainly, not 
yet a wife). 

This tiny loss of input went un- 
noticed by ultimac, which record- 
ed only what it was fed, not what it 
was not. Its glamorous, Govern- 
ment-chosen acronym bore no rela- 
tion to how it actually worked: it 
was necessarily a topological com- 
puter, geared despite all its decimal 
places to losing, in the byways of its 
virtually total connectivity, some 
information it did have. It compen- 
sated, it worked; that was enough. 
And it was particularly good, as 
predicted, at servicing itself. No 
human hand had been asked to 
touch it from the moment it had 



THE GLITCH 



103 




gone on stream, and most certainly 
not Ivor’s. 

Nor would he have touched it if 
asked. As far as he was concerned, 
Utopia had arrived. Besides, top- 
ology was not his sub-specialty — in 
fact, he knew less about it than he 
did about, say, poetry — and in ten 
years of calculated idleness he had 
almost forgotten the sub-specialty 
itself. He had even given up worry- 
ing. He did remember the trade- 
secret I.A.’s since he had sworn a 
solemn oath to do so, but bearing 
them in mind had become a useless 
exercise. As for keeping an eye out 
for remote sands in which to bury 
his head, Just In Case, that had 
retreated into complacent fantasy. 

So it was nobody’s fault but his 
own that when the glitch hit ulti- 
mac, he was virtually next door to 
the monster and was hired — nay, 
ordered — to fix it. By its very 
nature the rest of this story is not 
stored in ultimac or anywhere 
else. It is quite a sad story, and you 
may not wish to read on. It requires 
a lot of explanation, too, and 
neither sadness nor explanations 
are welcome in our present real 
Utopia. But they meant a lot to Ivor 
back in those days, and justice 
must be served, even to him. 



H ence: among the esoteric 

I. A.’s — those trade secret 
Laws of Computerics to which Ivor 
was sworn, were the following: 

I. Tell the customer nothing 



about the machine even if you know 
something about it. If he insists, 
give him an incomplete Xerox copy 
of the assembly instructions for 
next year's model. The head office 
will have insured that his present 
•jnodel is incomplete and that de- 
livery date for the missing com- 
ponent cannot be predicted. If by 
any chance the customer has a com- 
plete machine, the On-Off switch 
has been designed not to function 
more than one time in six, which is 
the last thing the customer will sus- 
pect. 

II. When the machine malfunc- 
tions, blame the customer's pro- 
grammers. The manufacturer will 
then send in its own programming 
team to re-train the customer' s 
programmers, on the premises. 
The manufacturer's team is highly 
skilled in disagreeing with the cus- 
tomer's team, item by item and 
over a long period. 

III. After an independent pro- 
graming team has been called in, 
and has reached an impasse with 
the first two, you ( the service engi- 
neer) will be asked to investigate 
the machine itself. Since no ma- 
chine makes a record of where or 
why it has malfunctioned, your 
duties are: 

A. Disappearing into the ma- 
chine for as long as possible. 

B. Introducing a new malfunc- 
tion which you then correct. 

D. Filing a long and incompre- 
hensible report. 

A good service engineer should also 



104 



GALAXY 




master the art of disagreeing with 
glacial impartiality with all three 
programing teams. 

IV. By this time the guarantee 
will have expired. Notify the manu- 
facturer to send a salesman to the 
customer with colorful brochures 
about the succeeding model. Never 
at any time even hint that the mal- 
function was actually inside the 
machine. 

These Laws had once functioned 
very well but none were of any use 
to Ivor when he was confronted 
with ultimac. The Fourth Law was 
particularly inappropriate, since 
there could not be any succeeding 
machine to tout. And he had been 
put on the job, naturally, because 
of his wrong-headed public spirit; 
for though he had not pressed it 
very hard or very long, both Powell 
and Amin remembered that he had 
predicted that something would go 
wrong. It was a perfect syllogism: 
he had predicted it, he was a service 
engineer, he was the man to fix it: 
Q.E.D. 

Of course he did know, in a gross 
way, what the malfunction was. In 
answer to school-children’s ques- 
tions ultimac had taken to print- 
ing out, in the home, answers that 
would have been of dubious suita- 
bility even to advanced medical stu- 
dents. This part of its operation 
had been shut down. The matter 
seemed minor on the surface, but 
chills of premonition passed up and 
down the spines of Government 
officials when they remembered 



that ultimac was running every- 
thing else, too. 

“The next thing,” Powell told 
him grimly, “might be banana oil 
from the water taps. Or something 
much worse. You were right all 
along, Ivor. Go to it.” 

Okay. But how? Like all service 
engineers — inevitably, since no 

single man could know everything 
there was to know about com- 
puters— Ivor knew only one kind of 
fault to look for. When he actually 
found one such, he fixed it. When 
he didn’t, he created one and then 
fixed that, in accordance with 
Clause B of the Third Law. That 
wouldn’t work this time, either. 

Superficially, he might have 
seemed just the man to deal with 
ultimac, since his particular sub- 
specialty was storage-and-retrieval, 
which was where the machine was 
(up to now) going potty. But that 
was a layman’s mistake, though a 
natural one to make even for 
Powell, ultimac had a glitch: that 
is, also in strict accordance with the 
opening proposition of the Third 
Law, it had not recorded the cause 
of its malfunction. Moreover, since 
the glitch was a slippage in storage- 
and-retrieval, the chances were 
high that the machine had actively 
wiped out whole areas of other in- 
formation that might — just 
might — have contained a clue or 
two. 

His hand sweating on the grip of 
his overloaded tool kit, Ivor was 
reverently ushered to a low doorway 



THE GLITCH 



105 




through which no man had passed 
in ten years, ultimac slid the door 
shut behind him with a gritty slam 
for which “reverently” was the least 
applicable description since “hope- 
fully” had fallen out of use before 
Ivor had even been born. 



E xcept for the sound of Niagara 
Falls, muted by diversion 
through hundreds of thousands of 
channels to a delicate murmur, the 
hibge building was almost silent. 
Occasionally there would be a small 
salvo of clicking noises', as though 
Ivor’s first wife had broken a string 
of beads; and once, briefly, he 
thought he heard a louder, harsher 
version of the water sound. The air 
was fresh, bone-dry and in gentle 
motion, now and then carrying a 
whiff of ozone, and less often of 
things of which he could only say 
that they were certainly not ozone. 

Concrete corridors stretched 
away from him radially and con- 
fusingly, twitching around corners 
and out of sight in no apparent 
pattern. They bore painted code 
numbers and Ivor had been given a 
map, but the reality was not so 
simple. The corridors had not been 
built for human traverse. They 
were even lower than the door, 
single-file narrow, and had rails 
running down their middles. Since 
he had to suspect the rails of being 
electrified, he at once found that 
his pace and posture had to be ap- 
proximately that of a swan out of 



water, and frequently further com- 
plicated by switch-points wherever 
the corridors crossed. Also, there 
was a lot of static; his hair stood up 
like a corona in a brush discharge. 
If he should touch metal at all . 
but he tried not to think about that. 

He had not progressed very far 
when he heard the harsh water 
noise again, this time growing 
louder. At its climax, something 
much like a fictional robot appear- 
ed ahead of him from the right, 
turned smartly on the track points 
and retreated down the same cor- 
ridor he was waddling along. 

Ivor was too startled to get a 
good look at the thing. But he had 
the impression that it was about his 
own height and width, was about 
three times as thick, and had about 
ten times as many appendages as 
he did. Also, it most certainly did 
not waddle like a swan. .It drove, 
and purposefully. 

Here was a danger he should 
have foreseen. As a self-repairing 
machine of record size, ultimac 
had to have its own servicing 
devices: slave mechanical equiva- 
lents of Ivor himself, mobile and 
able to reach every cranny of the 
edifice. The corridors were design- 
ed for their passage. Moreover, 
should he encounter one, there 
would be no room for both of them, 
and it would obviously be hopeless 
to try to tell it to stop. 

After that his progress was fur- 
ther slowed. For at every intersec- 
tion he had to check the setting of 



106 



GALAXY 




the track-points so that if one ef the 
servos should come up behind him, 
he would be able to jump aside in 
the direction it was not going to go. 
Worse, as a by-product he promptly 
got lost. He wished fervently for a 
compass. Yet an ordinary magnetic 
one would have been whirlingly use- 
less in this electronic maze, and a 
gyro-compass would have been too 
bulky — his tool-kit arms were ach- 
ing already. However, he managed 
to retrace his steps with the help of 
the map and start over from where 
he had gone wrong. 

Not long afterward, he heard the 
noise again. This time he saw the 
machine much earlier because it 
was coming directly toward him. 
He had plenty of time to retreat to a 
previous intersection where, he 
found, the servo was not going to 
turn in either direction. His early 
spotting had been aided by the fact 
that on the front of the thing a red 
code-number glowed like the dis- 
play on a pocket calculator. As it 
passed he was able to see that the 
numbers were indeed a display, 
inside a slot-like window. 

Here was a problem a good deal 
simpler than the glitch in that it 
was probably soluble. There seemed 
no reason to number the servos 
themselves, and even had there 
been one, painted lettering would 
have served. A display subject to 
change more reasonably suggested 
indication of the gadget’s tempo- 
rary area of assignment. He 
checked the code he had seen 



against his map. Yes, there was 
such a combination, about a mile 
back and to one side of the route he 
had been following. 

An idea so crafty smote him that 
he almost chuckled before he rea- 
lized that he had to be dead silent, 
or be dead. After he stopped 
trembling, it still seemed like a 
good idea. 

Why not hitch a ride? Or a series 
of them? Even if it made his course 
much more indirect, it would be 
faster in the long run and just pos- 
sibly safer, too. 

He got back in motion on his own 
in the meantime. In an hour’s 
further uncomfortable progress he 
saw three more servos. He studied 
them as carefully as possible. All 
those appendages made him ner- 
vous; he wanted to make very sure 
that the gadgets were oblivious of 
him. There was only one way to be 
certain of that, which was to stand 
in the path of one, just beyond 
where the points showed it would 
have to turn away from him — and 
keep a sharp eye for last-minute 
changes in the track setting. On the 
third encounter, he nerved himself 
to try it. 

The machine did not even falter; 
and as it turned off, he saw on its 
rear a lattice-like structure festoon- 
ed with tools — replacement 

“hands” for its many arms. He 
could cling to that rack. It would be 
uncomfortable, but anything would 
be better by now than this back- 
breaking swan gait. 



THE GLITCH 



107 




At his first attempt, he dropped 
his kit while jumping. The next 
one, however, worked. The servo 
took him nearly as far away from 
his goal as it was possible to go; but 
at least he had learned that the 
trick was possible. (All experi- 
ments, after all, require several 
stages.) After that, he checked the 
map each time, and jumping only 
on those machines whose smoky- 
red codes showed destinations 
nearer and nearer where he was 
supposed to be. 

To an omniscient observer his 
course would have resembled a 
three-dimensional version of the 
Brownian movement but he reached 
his goal eventually, or almost. As 
he had expected, no servo ever 
turned up that was going directly to 
the lair of the glitch, because this 
was precisely the area in which ul- 
timac itself did not know it was in 
trouble. He had to waddle the last 
half mile. 

Once arrived, he sat down and 
rested a while, feeling sticky as his 
sweat dried in the dehydrated air, 
but in a faint glow of pride at his 
own cunning and courage. Above 
all, for the first time he felt safe. 
This was the one place in the whole 
building where he would not and 
could not be threatened by the 
servos. After his heart stopped 
pounding, he opened his kit and 
approached the faceplate of the 
children’s answering service, Phil- 
lips screwdriver in hand. 

He had extracted two bolts and 



was working on a third when all 
hell broke loose. It began with a 
nearly-supersonic whistle, fortis- 
simo, which made him so dizzy that 
he dropped the screwdriver and 
nearly fell. While he was still stag- 
gering, the now familiar roar of a 
servo grew over the other noise, and 
then he was grabbed from behind 
by all his available appendages at 
once, nose and ears included, and 
rushed out of the chamber. 

ultimac did not, by definition, 
know it had a glitch in storage- 
and- retrieval. But now it had 
spotted a gross malfunction there. 
It was Ivor Harrigan and his bag of 
tools. 



T he building, as has been re- 
marked, had not been designed 
for any human presence, and if 
ULTIMAC had ever been pro- 
gramed to accept a rare living re- 
pairman, that memory had been 
wiped out too — just the kind of 
glitch nobody would ever detect 
until too late. Instead, the com- 
puter treated him, ungently, as a 
misplaced component. The first 
problem evidently turned out to be 
identifying the component and lo- 
cating where in the machine it was 
supposed to fit. 

This involved thrusting Ivor into 
a sort of outsize coffin where he was 
probed, rotated, measured, tested 
for conductivity — painful, but 
luckily the very first low shock must 
have shown that nothing so bulky 



108 



GALAXY 




could be primarily a resistor — 
shape, transparency, terminal 
matchings (hair by hair), moving 
parts (an aerial ballet of his cloth- 
ing and the contents of his kit), and 
many other characteristics beyond 
his detection, including, doubtless, 
radioactivity and Gauss level. 
Though subjected to a series of X- 
rays, at least he was not subjected 
to chemical analysis. 

Short work was made of the tools 
themselves. They were familiar and 
were whisked away, doubtless to be 
put into some storage rack for use 
at need by a servo. They may have 
decided the issue, for after a 
pause — three or four minutes, 
practically an eternity for a com- 
puter and more than one for the 
now wrist watch-less Ivor — ulti- 
mac decided what kind of com- 
ponent he was: a new model of 
servo-mechanism, potentially more 
useful than the ones that ran on 
tracks, but at present badly out of 
adjustment. (For example, the un- 
necessary complexity of that inter- 
nal wave-guide system . .) 

Ivor came to this conclusion only 
when he found himself on a con- 
veyor-belt, neatly spaced between 
two ordinary servos whose innards 
were being reworked by devices 
that extruded themselves from the 
walls of the tube the belt crawled 
along. These devices he managed to 
dodge. He could not, however, pre- 
vent himself from being repainted 
and dried, twice; all he could do 
was close his eyes and stop breath- 



ing while the sprays were on. 

The third coat, as he recognized 
by the smell, was a coat of enamel. 
Inevitably the next stop would be a 
baking oven, he warned himself. 

But the servo in front of him had 
not needed repainting, and the belt 
split to carry it off to somewhere 
else. Ivor ducked after it. He found 
himself in what he supposed must 
be the robot equivalent of a re- 
covery room. 

Bent almost double, his paint 
cracking and peeling with every 
move but without a gram of detect- 
able metal anywhere upon him, 
Ivor sprinted until at last he found 
an exit. On the way, he disabled 
everything he recognized, and threw 
switches at random on everything 
he didn’t. 

By the time he got out, ultimac 
had become noisier than Niagara 
Falls had ever been, and three 
minutes later became the largest 
barrel ever to go over it. 



T o the end of his life he was 
called Ivor the Glitch, and in 
history still is. He never got another 
job, either. But he still had his 
bank with the built-in error; and 
however he may have felt about it 
all, things are quieter around here 
now. There always had been people 
who had been uneasy at the thought 
that they might wake up tomorrow 
to find the Amazon River running 
backward. -(30)- ★ 



THE GLITCH

JERRY POURNELLE, Ph.O. 



SCIENCE FACT 



A STEP 

FARTHER 

OUT 



HOW LONG TO DOOMSDAY? 



^ YV7 HILE y° u are reac *' n 8 these 
W words four people will have 
died from starvation. Most of them 
children.” 

Thus opens Paul Ehrlich’s The 
Population Bomb. 

“It seems' to me, then, that by 
2000 AD or possibly earlier, man’s 
social structure will have utterly 
collapsed, and that in the chaos 
that will result as many as three 
billion people will die. Nor is there 
likely to be a chance of recovery 
thereafter ...” 

Thus closes a popular article by 
Dr. Isaac Asimov, perhaps the 
best-known science writer in 
America. 

It would not be hard to multiply 
examples of doom-crying among 
science fiction writers. There are 
dozens of stories describing life in 
these United States after the year 
2000 as poor, nasty, brutish, and 
short — although hardly solitary, as 
Hobbes would have had it. 



Much of this doomsaying springs 
from three books: Ehrlich’s work 
previously mentioned and two out- 
puts from MIT: World Dynamics 
and The Limits to Growth. All are 
essentially mathematical trend pro- 
jections, with the MIT studies em- 
ploying detailed computer models. 

Strangely, intellectuals including 
s-f writers have a lot of confidence 
in these models, although they have 
very little in the ability of social or 
physical scientists to save us. It’s 
almost impossible to overestimate 
the influence of these three books. 
Writers make predictions based on 
them; teachers quote fourth-hand 
sources which quote the original 
studies. They have become “con- 
ventional wisdom” for the young. 

First, the blurb that opens Ehr- 
lich’s book is clearly wrong. My 
copy was published in 1969, a year 
in which about 53 million people 
died from all causes. It takes four 
seconds to read the blurb, so for 



110 





one person to die each second, 31.5 
million — about 60 percent of all 
deaths — would have had to have 
been from starvation. 

Taking the UN cause-of-death 
statistics and being as fair as pos- 
sible by including as “starvation” 
any cause of death related to nutri- 
tion — diptheria, typhus, parasitic 
diseases, etc. — we get about a 
million, or some 5'/2 percent. Dr. 
Ehrlich is off by a factor of 10. 

Actually, world agriculture is 
keeping up with population — so 
far. At the Mexico City meeting of 
the AAAS last year. Dr. H.A.B. 
Parpia, the senior professional of 
the UN’s Food and Agricultural 
Organization, told me that just 
about every country raises enough 
food to be self-sufficient. It’s 
grown, but sometimes not harvest- 
ed; or if harvested, not eaten. In 
many countries vermin get more of 
the crop than the people; insects 
outeat people almost everywhere. 
The pity is that the technology to 
harvest and preserve enough for 
everyone exists right now. 

Now, this anti-doom essay is not 
a Pollyanna exercise. There’s no 
excuse for relaxing and saying that 
hunger is a myth. It isn’t. But a 
simple thing like mylar sheeting to 
line traditional grain storage pits 
and keep out insects could stop fa- 
mine in 20 percent of the world. 
Other simple technologies could 
prevent hunger elsewhere. 

So we know how to do it. But we 
won’t do it unless we’re willing to 



try. We won’t get anywhere sitting 
around crying, “Doom!” 

Yet according to Dr. Ehrlich’s 
book, “The battle to feed all of 
humanity is over. In the 1970’s the 
world will undergo famines — hun- 
dreds of millions of people are 
going to starve to death in spite of 
any crash programs embarked up- 
on now.” 

The other side of the coin was 
expressed in the Hudson Institute’s 
The Year 2000 , which points out 
that the level of rice yield per acre 
under cultivation in India has not 
yet equaled what the Japanese 
could do in the Twelfth Century. 
Another analyst, Colin Clark, has 
shown that if the Indian farmer 
could only reach the production 
levels of the South Italian peasant, 
there would be no danger of starva- 
tion in Indian for a good time to 
come. 

In other words, it doesn’t take 
miracle rice, fertilizers and a high- 
energy civilization to hold off dis- 
aster in the developing countries. It 
only takes adding technology to tra- 
ditional peasant skills: showing 
people how to use mylar and simple 
non-persistent fungicides for food 
storage along with peasant produc- 
tion methods long known in Asia. 

Actually very simple measures 
can have a profound effect. If India 
were to suffer an invasion of mon- 
sters who deliberately killed every 
third cow, the remaining cattle 
would be healthier and yield a great 
increase in milk and cheese proteins 



111 




available for humans. More pro- 
teins in childhood would cut back 
infant diseases like kwashiorkor 
and “red baby”; those diseases 
have the effect of permanently low- 
ering adult IQ by about 20 points. 
What if the next generation of a de- 
veloping country were “20 IQ points 
more intelligent?” 

But some doomsters will now 
quote Malthus: if we help those 
people feed themselves, they’ll only 
breed to famine levels again. Some 
will add, “So what’s the point of 
it?” 

The best answer is that histori- 
cally, people haven’t done that. 
When nations reach a high level of 
technology — and of infant sur- 
vival — the fertility rate falls. The 
U.S. appeared to be an exception 
to that with the “baby boom” of 
World War II, but now that 
squiggle in the fertility rate has 
passed; the girls born in 1944 are 
30 years old now, and the number 
of girls born per fertile girl in the 
U.S. has fallen to all-time lows. 

T here’s another form of doom 
not so fashionably discussed: 
the Marching Morons (that is, the 
least successful) tend to have the 
most children. It’s one we must 
face, but it’s doubtful that before 
the year 2000 it will have destroyed 
our social institutions. 

As a matter of fact, given present 
population trends, the U.S. won’t 
have many more people in 2000 
than now. Population is growing; 



there’s a “bow wave” generated by 
the World War II “baby boom”; 
but best projections show us peak- 
ing in about 2025 with population 
then declining to its present level — 
where it will stay. 

Suppose that never happens, and 
we reach 350 million people before 
something stops U.S. population 
growth. The area of the U.S. is 
about 9.5 million kilometers2; of 
that, some is water, and some 
simply uninhabitable. Call it 8 
million even, and we have a present 
population of 25.4 people/km2. 

If we reach 350 million — and few 
projections show us getting there in 
50 years^ — we would have 43.5 
people/km^, a big increase. Some 
writers say that will be sufficient to 
drive us all stark, staring mad. 
We’ll be inundated with personal 
contacts, at each others’ throats, 
sleeping in hallways, and generally 
miserable as civilization collapses. 

Well, what civilized countries 
have population densities higher 
than the doom-level, 43.5? 

Practically all of them. West 
Germany, not an uncivilized place, 
has 244 people/km2, equivalent to 
1.9 billion people in the U.S.! 
Denmark has 114 people/km2; 
France 93; England and Wales, 
322. Even Scotland, with its high- 
lands and islands and hills and 
moors, has 66. 

What densities can people stand 
and remain sane? No one really has 
an answer to that. But the Nether- 
lands, a charming place, has 319 



112 



GALAXY 




people/km^; the Channel Islands 
has 641; and Monaco,, the densest 
place on earth, has 16,000! 

Of course, the U.S. could not be 
packed like Monaco or England. 
We would not like it if our country 
were as thickly populated as Den- 
mark (although our eastern sea- 
board is more densely populated in 
places right now); but surely we 
would not go insane if we lived as 
close together as the Scots! 

Moreover, we have the technol- 
ogy right now to support a large 
population while preserving wilder- 
ness. Soleri’s Arcologies is a fascin- 
ating book; he shows enormous 
cities built on a few square miles of 
land, leaving parks and woodlands 
between them. 

Less ambitiously, I am “design- 
ing” a city for a story about Los 
Angeles in the future; in my design, 
a 50-level building contains lodging 
stores, conveniences, recreation, 
employment and transportation for 
250,000 people. The building is 2 
miles on a side and sits on an area 4 
miles on a side; 250,000 people in 
16 square miles. Fewer than a 
hundred of such buildings would 
hold the entire U.S. non-farm pop- 
ulation — and my structure is not 
only small by Soleri’s standards, 
but uses very little technology we 
don’t already have.

miniums with full conveniences, 
recreation, and transportation; 
they cost more than the suburbs yet 
most of their inhabitants are refu- 
gees from suburbia. It no longer 
seems fantastic at all. Why not live 
in a convenient place where you can 
walk to work, take an escalator to 
the opera and a train to the beach? 

No. The evidence is clear that the 
population bomb won’t kill us or 
drive us mad within our lifetimes. 
Certainly we can’t keep doubling 
populations as fast as we have in 
the past — but why assume we will? 
When Malthus made his gloomy 
predictions, someone running off 
the exponential growth equations 
would have calculated that England 
in 1970 would have 400 million 
people instead of the present 55 
million. 

Population stability won’t hap- 
pen of itself; but most of the really 
alarming population growth has 
been through prolonging of life. 
Birth rates have declined through 
this century, but people live longer 
despite wars, famines, pollution, 
insecticides, crowding and all the 
other forms of doom. Since there’s 
a limit to just how long anyone can 
live, the death-rate is due for a 
climb before 2000. Already many 
countries have aging populations; 
including the U.S., of course. It 
was never true that “over half the 
people are under 25” and it gets 
less true all the time. Much of the 
“population explosion” is a one- 
time artifact, and you can’t just 



simply apply equations of exponen- 
tial growth to the Twentieth Cen- 
tury to predict the future. 

The MIT models of doom use 
precisely three parameters to pre- 
dict the world population, and take 
no real account of the difference 
between population growth among 
developed nations and developing 
countries. 

Certainly population pressure 
can finish us off; but must we 
believe we’ll get to the Soylent 
Green stage before something is 
done about it? The evidence is that 
the technologically advanced coun- 
tries have already done something 
about it; and certainly we won’t be 
destroyed by overpopulation before 
2020. 

I f we have defused, or at least de- 
layed, the population bomb, 
what’s the next thing to kill us? 
Pollution, usually. The MIT models 
indicate that we must limit capital 
expenditure, de-technologize before 
pollution does us in. Dr. Asimov 
says that if we survive going mad, 
we’ll be up against it because of 
energy limits. 

He’s right, of course, and even 
more so when he points out that 
even if we were able to rip all the 
coal and oil out of the ground to set 
a match to for heat, we would loose 
so much carbon-dioxide that the 
greenhouse effect would raise the 
temperature of the earth. The 
temperature rise would either melt 
the ice-caps, drowning the sea-

coasts, or (according to some 
climatologists) move so much water 
vapor over the poles, where it would 
freeze out, that we would start a 
new ice age. Either way, it would 
not be pleasant. 

That doom is only 100 years 
away. Few of us will see it, but our 
children might; and we’d be poor 
parents if we didn’t worry about it. 
Some put industrial pollution as 
reaching killing levels far earlier, 
although almost all give us until 
2000 — 25 years or so — to do some- 
thing. 

Yet pollution is easily conquered. 
We already have the technology to 
reduce any given pollution to any 
desired level. 1 have a bottle of 
drinkable sewage — reclaimed — on 
my desk right now. It only takes 
money and energy. 

We can even do it without giving 
up essentials, although some, 
luxuries such as electric can-open- 
ers, power carving-knives, heated 
swimming pools in individual back- 
yards, perhaps even driving 400 
miles to conventions instead of 
taking a train, might have to go. 
We certainly won’t starve. 

However, pollution control takes 
energy, specifically electricity; and 
electric generators are themselves 
polluting. This seems a dilemma 
with no way out. 

Actually, it’s artificial. We could 
right now be constructing fission 
plants to generate non-polluting 
electricity. Fission plants produce 
radioactive wastes that must be 



stored, and there’s a small chance 
of a really bad nuclear accident, so 
they are not a feasible long-term 
answer; but we can build them, and 
don’t only because of legal restric- 
tions. Incidentally, we will 50,000 
people a year with automobiles and 
put up with it; what are the chances 
of that bad a nuclear accident each 
year? We also kill thousands to tens 
of thousands with emphysema and 
other consequences of pollution 
from our fossil-fuel plants; who 
weighs those real deaths against the 
theoretical ones from more nuclear 
power plants? 

We will need fission, for a while; 
but it’s a dead-end. It increases the 
heat loosed on the earth (although 
not the C02); and fission plants 
require cold water for cooling, a 
resource we really are running out 
of fast. 

Better we should burn hydrogen. 
Hydrogen ash is water; no C02 and 
no sulfur oxides. There will be 
oxides of nitrogen problems with 
any hot-fired boiler, so that event- 
ually we will have to get electricity 
from less efficient systems such as 
hydrogen fuel-cells working at low 
temperatures; but doom from elec- 
tric plants burning hydrogen is a 
long time off. 

Where to get the hydrogen? 
Hardly from fossil fuels, of course, 
and as to nuclear fusion, not only is 
it at lest 30 years off (on a com- 
mercial scale, anyway) but it isn’t 
the great panacea to begin with. 
Not only is it likely to require cool- 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



115 




ing water, but fusion creates heat 
that was not on earth before. We 
need energy that doesn’t upset the 
planetary heat balance. 

Fortunately, the sun shines on 
tropical waters all over the earth. 
The surface water in the tropics 
remains an even 20 to 25° C while 
the water in the depths below is 
about 5° C. That little temperature 
difference is equivalent to a water- 
fall of 90 feet. 

We have the technology right 
now to generate electricity by using 
"hot” water on the tropical surface 
to boil something like propane or 
freon, passing the low-temperature 
steam through a turbine, and con- 
densing it on the other side with 
cold water brought up from the 
depths. No fuel needed. 

The volumes of water per kilo- 
watt generated passing through the 
plant are similar to those already 
being pumped through convention- 
al water-cooled fossil-fuel plants. 

The Gulf Stream holds about 75 
times as much energy as the U.S. 
now uses. The Sea of Cortez has 
somewhat more. It’s all renewed by 
the sun every day; you can't run 
out. So there’s enough energy in the 
tropics to run the world for a long 
time to come, and it doesn’t pollute. 
In fact, bringing the cold water up 
from the bottom is the same as the 
natural phenomenon known as 
“upwelling” — and in areas of 
natural upwelling more than half 
the worlds’ fish are presently 
caught. 



The deep cold water is full of 
nutrients; get them to the surface 
and sunlight, and you have plank- 
ton blooms. Shrimp and fish grow 
like mad. They can be harvested to 
help with the protein and food 
shortage. 

as to how the energy gets from 
the sea-based generators in the 
tropics to the energy-hungry USA, 
once the electricity is generated it 
can be used to hydrolize water; and 
the resulting hydrogen can be 
pumped in the present natural-gas 
pipelines plus others like them we 
would build as needed. 

I’ll have more to say about this 
energy system in another column. 
It works. In fact, Georges Claude, 
the inventor of the neon light, built 
an operating 20 KW pilot plant 
outside Havana in 1929. Some 
analysts think the temperature-dif- 
ference system is right now econo- 
mically competitive with conven- 
tional coal-fired generators; and it 
takes no breakthroughs, unlike 
fusion. 

My point, though, is that if one 
thing won’t do it, something else 
will. This is the first generation in 
history to not only be concerned 
about ecology and conservation but 
also to have the resources to do 
something practical about them 
without condemning much of the 
world to starvation. 

We live in one of the most ex- 
citing times in all history. Surely we 
can do better than cry doom! ★

GALAXY 




An Editorial Appeal 

Commencing with the June issues, Galaxy and Worlds of If 
will begin to fully show the results of an entirely new editorial 
policy. For example, the combined author line-up for June reads 
like a Who’s Who of the field: Isaac Asimov, James Blish, Alexei 
and Cory Panshin, Fred Pohl, Lester del Rey, Mack Reynolds, 
Fred Saberhagen, James H. Schmitz, Robert Silverberg, Ted 
Sturgeon, Jack Williamson — and more! No mean list, I think 
you’ll agree. 

Check the contents-pages (themselves so changed as to be 
virtual new features ) and you will find several additions. 

Galaxy: Forum, a platform for sf and/or science notables who 
feel they have something important — and interesting! — to convey 
to the readership; Interface, an intermittent series of interviews 
cum thumbnail biographies by Ted Sturgeon (scheduled to begin 
in July with an interview of Roger Elwood); Showcase, (also 
scheduled for July) a non-verbal feature — a new piece of sf-art 
by an acknowledged master, which has as its only justification 
that its creator thinks it’s something special. And of course Book- 
shelf, Directions and Galaxy Stars will continue to flourish as of 
yore — more than yore, in fact. 

Worlds of If: The Alien Viewpoint, an insider’s view of sf. 
Crusty, hard-bitten, cynical old Dick Geis (Editor/Publisher of 
The Alien Critic) lays it on the line — his opinions are not neces- 
sarily those of the management! Ars Gratia, much like Galaxy 
Showcase, but -for Up-and-Comers; Future Perfect, next issue’s 
goodies — at least some of them; The Editor’s Page in June is 
devoted to my personal favorite among the many past editors of 
Worlds of If. In future, it will be what the name implies — the 
editor’s page. And, as with Galaxy, all the old features will re- 
main in residence. 

But all of this takes money, a good deal of it — and the profit 
motive remains an operant factor in the publishing industry. To

GALAXY 






THE ORG'S EGG 

Part III of III 




FREDERIK POHL and JACK WILLIAMSON 



WHA T HAS GONE BEFORE 

The astronomical object called 
Cuckoo is plunging toward our 
Galaxy. Literally the biggest riddle 
in the universe, it is impossibly 
large and impossibly light. With 
ten million times the sun’s bulk, it 
has only ten times the mass. 

Yet — with the average density of 
the inside of an electric-light bulb — 
it somehow has a solid surface, and 



that surface is inhabited by human 
beings and other creatures. 

In the deep air and weak gravity 
of Cuckoo, human beings can fly 
with only their own muscle-power. 
ORG RIDER, a boy from a tribe of 
native wingmen. has set out to find 
the nest of an org. a strange crea- 
ture native to Cuckoo, so that he 
can steal an egg. hatch it and train 
the infant org to be a mount for 
him. 



119 



In his journey, he has encounter- 
ed the beetle-like WATCHERS, in- 
telligent and malevolent creatures 
that breed human beings like cattle, 
and REDLAW, a gigantic human 
slave. 

An expedition of Terrestrial hu- 
man beings and other intelligent 
races of the galactic culture is ex- 
ploring Cuckoo. They have arrived 
bv tachyonic transmission — a pro- 
cess that uses the faster- than- light 
speed oftachyon beams to transmit 
an exact copy of any person or 
thing anywhere in the universe — 
leaving the unchanged originals be- 
hind. Every time a person travels by 
tachyon he replicates himself, so 
that a person rriay have a dozen or 
more copies of himself scattered 
about the galaxy. 

BEN PERTIN and ZARA DOY 
are two of the humans engaged in 
exploring Cuckoo. Both of them 
originated on Earth and were trans- 
mitted to the central administrative 
headquarters for the galaxy. Sun 
One. There they met and married. 
Now other copies of them are on or 
near Cuckoo. Several of the copies 
of Pertin have already reached the 
surface and died there; one or two 
are still alive, but out of touch with 
the others. 

Org Rider achieves his objective 
by stealing an egg from an org's 
nest. Pursued by the enraged 
parents, he hides in a cave and 
there meets one of the fugitive, 
injured copies of Ben Pertin. Along 
with Redlaw, they evade the adult 



orgs and the watchers and head for 
what they hope will be a safe re- 
fuge — but there they find them- 
selves witness to an attack on Zara 
Dov and others of her expedition. 
Zara is injured and forced to land, 
alone in the jungle — completely 
alone, in the weird wilderness of 
Cuckoo. 



O rg rider involuntarily started 
to move forward to help Ben 
Yale Pertin, but Redlaw caught his 
arm. 

“Don’t touch him!” the giant 
rumbled. Then, looking past Org 
Rider to the stranger, he lowered 
his voice. “There’s nothing you can 
do for him now. That slime doesn’t 
thrive on vegetation. It eats flesh. 
He’s done for.” 

“But — but it's only some kind of 
sap, or something like that. We can 
take him to the river, wash it off — ” 
“You’re not hearing me, boy. 
There’s no chance for him at all. If 
he’s lucky, he’ll be dead in five 
sleeps. If he’s not, he’ll linger on 
for a dozen. But there’s no way to 
clean him now, and he’s death to 
touch.” 

Pertin was staring at them, aware 
they were talking about him, 
suspicious of what they were saying. 
He asked a question that Org Rider 
could not understand, but Redlaw 
chirped some sort of answer in the 
whistling screech of the watchers. 
Under his breath he remarked to 
the boy, “He said those bones were 



120 



GALAXY 




his. What can he mean by that?” 
Org Rider said, with the uneasy 
fascination of horror. “It is as it 
was before, Redlaw. Remember? 
He died already, and he came alive 
again. Can it be that he dies many 
times and always lives again?” 

“If he lives again after that blue 
slime gets through with him, I’ll be 
astonished,” rumbled the giant. 
“Ah, well. We can’t help him, but 
we can feed him. I’ll get some food. 
You build a fire.” 

“What about the slamming ma- 
chine?” cried the boy. 

The giant nodded somberly. 
“There it is,” he agreed. “We’ll ask 
Ben Yale Pertin if there are wea- 
pons there. But if they’ve got that 
blue slime on them, it will be tick- 
lish work to find a way to use 
them.” 

“Can’t we clean them?” 

“Ah, yes, clean them. But it’s 
being sure they’re clean that’s the 
hard part. And one single drop of 
the blue murder, so tiny you might 
not even see it, is enough for death. 
If you see it anywhere on you, boy, 
on toe or finger, wherever, don’t 
wait. If it’s only a toe, lop off the 
foot! It’s miserable work to do, but 
it’s your life if you don’t!” 

Numbly the boy nodded, then 
turned to his org. “Don't go near 
him. Babe,” he ordered. The soft 
trunk squirmed out to touch him 
reassuringly. 

“What I think,” ruminated Red- 
law, staring at Ben Yale Pertin, 
who was scrabbling feverishly in the 



wreckage of the ship, “is that this 
slamming machine is not his but 
another’s. Identical ships. Maybe 
identical people. I think it landed 
on the living peak of Knife-in-the- 
Sky and touched the slime. Then it 
came down here. Its occupant, per- 
haps another Ben Pertin, came out 
and touched the slime. When he 
did that, it was too late for him.” 

The boy nodded, frowning. “Stay 
with this one, Redlaw,” he said. 
“Perhaps you can help him. I will 
get food.” But he knew as he left 
the org with a cautioning word and 
turned into the forest that there was 
no way for Redlaw to help Pertin, 
and that his real reason for going 
after food was that he could not 
bear to see him doomed thus to die. 
To die a third time! It was heavy 
enough to die once. What courage 
these people must have, to die 
again and again! 

He was fortunate almost at once, 
scouring the wet black gravel along 
a sluggish stream, when something 
like a buried log humped itself and 
sprang free of the black muck. The 
boy caught his knife and waited. In 
a moment he was rewarded; the 
“log” ripped suddenly down the 
back. 

A wild-flower sweetness exploded 
into the air, and a delicate pink 
shape thrust and thrust, struggling 
to escape from its black prison. Org 
Rider paused, entranced. It was too 
beautiful to kill for food! But he 
thought of the dying Ben Yale Per- 
tin, of the org; he had no choice. 



THEORG’S EGG 



121 




He waited until the tacy wings of 
black-veined rose unfolded, until 
the new-hatched creature gripped 
the sides of the canoe-like shell and 
slowly pulled itself free. Huge 
luminous eyes, glowing with the 
rosy red of live coals, gazed blankly 
at him. They were just beginning to 
focus when he was upon the thing 
with his knife, stabbing the new life 
out of it. 

W hen they had the skinned 
and gutted body of the 
butterfly-creature broiling over the 
low fire Redlaw had made, the 
giant took him aside. “Here is what 
1 have found,” he said with satis- 
faction. “Look?” And he offered 
an armful of gleaming objects to 
the boy. 

Org Rider recoiled. “They're 
from the slamming machine!” 
“Yes,” agreed Redlaw. “But I 
have taken them out myself, from 
the interior, where the blue slime 
did not penetrate. Ben Yale is 
angry at me because I would not let 
him touch them. I made him 
understand that the blue slime is 
deadly to us — though I did not say 
that it was also deadly to him,” he 
added in an undertone. 

“What is that stuff good for?” 

» “This,” said Redlaw proudly, “is 
a weapon.” He held up a thing 
shaped like a short seed-cone, with 
a slim cylinder perched at angles at 
its top. “It is not what I had hoped 
for,” he admitted. “It is only a 
laser. The watchers, too, have 



lasers. Still, it is better than any we 
have found so far!” 

The boy pointed to an elastic 
band in which were set tiny win- 
dows. “And that?” 

“It is for far-seeing. Look 
through it, Org Rider! You will see 
as far as you can travel in a dozen 
sleeps!” 

The boy took it gingerly. The 
elastic part clasped his skull gently 
but firmly as he donned it; the 
transparent part hung just over his 
eyebrows. Squinting upward, he 
caught strange bent glimpses of the 
treetops and clouds, like water- 
snakes seen through the turbulence 
of a rapid. 

He shook his head, causing the 
visor to pop into place in front of 
his eyes. And suddenly great broad 
yellow leaves rushed in on him from 
the tree over his head, and the 
bright golden clouds beyond swoop- 
ed down almost within arm’s 
length. Involuntarily he ducked, 
yelping. 

Redlaw guffawed. “Startles you, 
doesn’t it?” he rumbled. “But 
you’ll see watchers coming at you 
through that a hundred breaths 
before your bare eyes will see them, 
boy. And this thing — Ben Yale Per- 
tin calls it an ‘audio log,’ whatever 
that is — listen!” He touched a 
switch on the box, and a voice — 
Ben’s voice, the boy realized — be- 
gan to come from inside it some- 
where. Org Rider could not under- 
stand the word being said, to be 
sure; they were words of that 



122 



GALAXY 




strange gibberish tongue the 
stranger used. But it was his voice, 
beyond doubt. 

Redlaw’s mood changed. He 
dropped the audio log to the 
ground and stared at it angrily. 
“But there’s not what I wanted,” 
he muttered. “Not a weapon that 
the watchers don’t already have. 
Not anything that will let us destroy 
them!” 

“Perhaps Ben Pertin does not 
have such weapons,” Org Rider 
said. 

“He has them! Or his people do. 
I’d threaten to kill him, if it would 
make him get them for me! But 
what is such a threat to a man 
who’s dying already?” He stared at 
the squat stranger, then glanced 
past him into the woods. “Boy, 
what’s the matter with your org?” 

Tardily Org Rider realized that 
Babe had wandered away, was on 
the hillside above the wrecked 
slamming machine. The boy leaped 
to his feet, tensely afraid that the 
org might somehow brush against 
the blue death. But the org was not 
near the machine and showed no 
interest in it; something else was 
engaging its attention. It stood up- 
thrust on its great talons, huge eyes 
staring frozen into the sky, soft 
pink trunk squirming upward as 
though to feel what the eyes were 
looking at. 

‘‘What is it?” Org Rider de- 
manded sharply. The org did not 
even look at him. Then, reflected in 
the org’s eye, he saw a peculiar 



flash of bright cobalt blue. Star- 
tled, he looked upward through the 
leaf canopy and saw, lancing 
through the sky, a line of cobalt fire 
that winked, flashed again in a dif- 
ferent place, winked and flashed 
still again. The light was so intense 
it almost blinded him, who had 
seen few point sources of light in his 
life, but he was pretty sure he could 
make out several small dots around 
the bright blue beams. Distant 
rushing sounds, as of cloth tearing, 
came to him from where those 
bright beams flashed. “Lasers!” 
bellowed Redlaw. 

Remembering what he wore, Org 
Rider jerked the farseeing visor into 
place. After a moment of frantic 
search, he found the magnified 
images of what hung above him. A 
man! A man wearing a queer tree- 
trunk-like thing strapped to his 
back, pointing something like the 
weapon Redlaw had showed him; 
and around and below the man, 
falling like dead leaves through the 
sky, two, no three orgs. Dead. Slain 
by those bright blue bolts. 

The boy peered under the 
glasses, trying to make sense of 
what he saw, and became aware 
that there were other dots in the 
sky. It took him time to find them 
through the visor, but there they 
were — four or five creatures, and 
what strange creatures they were! 
Something that looked like a wing- 
ed woman made of silvery metal. A 
tiny beast with frail wings and a 
great hideous org-eyed head! A 



THE ORG’S EGG 



123 




thing that looked like an enormous 
eye, unsupported in the air! A 
machine, a — what? he could not 
say for sure, but something that re- 
sembled a single great cube of 
metal with metal attachments 
hanging from it — a cube that also 
floated unsupported in the air. And 
with them — 

Org Rider caught his breath, 
steadied the glasses and looked 
again. A woman. A girl. Dressed 
like Ben Yale Pertin and the man 
who had beamed down the org. But 
her pale face and bright eyes were 
unlike those of any female he had 
ever seen. 

He was jolted out of his reverie by 
Redlaw. “Give me that far-seer.” 
growled the giant, snatching it 
from Org Rider’s head. Bounding 
over to a clearing, Redlaw jammed 
the visor onto his own head, stared 
upward. “Blood and death!” he 
muttered. “What are those 
things?” He lifted the lenses away 
from his eyes and stared blankly at 
the boy. “Did you see them?” he 
demanded. “Queer machine things! 
Animals like nothing I’ve ever 
seen!” 

Org Rider made no answer. He 
was listening to the distant screams 
of orgs, wondering if they were the 
three he had seen killed, the sound 
reaching them so late because of 
distance; then he realized it could 
not be that. These screams were 
nearer. 

And suddenly the strange sights 
he had seen in the sky were driven 



from his mind, for he heard those 
wild screams repeated — less rau- 
cously but closer at hand. He 
turned and shouted, “Babe! What 
are you doing?” 

The young org turned the great 
eyes on him. The trunk was quiver- 
ing and snaking out, now toward 
Org Rider, now toward the sky. 
The boy bounded over to the org, 
caught it around the neck. “Don’t 
listen, Babe!” he begged, and the 
org mimicked, in his own voice: 

“Listen . listen . listen!” 

“Stay, Babe,” he coaxed, strok- 
ing the org’s quivering head. He 
could feel a roughness beneath the 
velvet, along the ridges over the 
great staring eyes, and knew that 
the hard bronze scales of maturity 
were beginning to form there. The 
shrieks of the wild orgs sounded 
again, nearer. “Please, Babe,” he 
begged. 

The org’s trembling stopped. It 
froze, staring into the sky, and the 
boy saw what its huge eyes had 
discovered. Black and narrow and 
swift against the gray sky, two orgs 
were scudding over the treetops, 
up-mountain, away from where 
their fellows had just been slain. 
And the cries they were shrilling 
were of fear and warning. 

The drives of his genes were too 
strong to resist. Babe answered 
with a hoarse, hooting cry and 
launched himself into the air. 

The first stroke of his powerful 
wing struck Org Rider, sent him 
tumbling across the mossy rock. As 



124 



GALAXY 




he picked himself up, Babe paused 
for an instant high above him. 
“Please,” it screamed, hoarsely 
mimicking the boy’s own voice. 
“Please . please . .” 

And it spun in air and climbed 
into the bright sky to follow its wild 
kin. 

Alone and desolate, Org Rider 
stood watching until Babe and the 
others were out of sight. 

XIII 

B en Yale Pertin had not been 
fooled by the red-haired giant’s 
pitiful attempts to dissemble. He 
had caught enough of the giant’s 
meaning through the translator to 
know that, from Redlaw’s point of 
view at least, the blue slime was 
bad medicine indeed. Pertin was 
not unconcerned about that, but he 
was sure these barbarians knew 
little about medicine. His first 
business was to find the medicpac 
in the wrecked exploration ship. He 
did not trouble to clean off the 
slime, not after the first trial at 
swabbing it from his skin had 
taught him something new about 
pain. However, he swabbed the 
stuff with anesthetizing and anti- 
septic creams from the pac, covered 
the affected surfaces with self-seal- 
ing bandages and sterilized them 
with a cleansing spray. The bone- 
deep itching began to fade at once 
and the pain went with it. 

Pertin then fished out the bottles 
of vitamin supplements and swal- 



lowed a week’s ration before he dug 
up proper food. A self-heating can 
of beef stew, another self-heating 
can that produced black coffee, a 
can of peaches thick in syrup — he 
stopped eating at last not because 
he was no longer hungry but be- 
cause he began to think he would 
burst. 

Then he turned his attention to 
less immediate problems, such as 
the two barbarians he was with. 
They seemed much taken with the 
laser gun, the farsight visor, the 
audio log; well, let the giant play. It 
did not matter. The log was only a 
spare. The weapon was more 
serious, in a way, but he had been 
at their mercy for — what? A week? 
A month? How could one tell in 
this place where there was never 
anything like day or night? Any- 
way, during that interval they had 
not tried to kill him. So possession 
of the weapon did not mean they 
would. Of course, if he had kept 
the weapon it would have main- 
tained the odds in his favor, he 
mused. Perhaps getting it back 
from them would be worthwhile, 
when chance offered . 

While Org Rider stroked his 
hatchling and the giant puzzled 
over the hardware, Pertin watched 
incuriously, idly stroking the ban- 
dages on his arms and legs. They 
were beginning to tingle again, he 
realized. That was odd, but there 
was no real pain. The imperative 
thing was to get himself in contact 
with civilization again, whereupon 



THEORG’S EGG 



125 




full medical treatment would of 
course be available. 

Unfortunately, this exploring 
ship was of a model different from 
the one he himself had been shot 
down in, and although there was a 
radio he could not make it work. 
Batteries run down? That seemed 
unlikely; most electrical systems 
were powered by radioisotopes that 
never did run down. Broken in the 
crash? It didn’t seem to be. He 
came to the conclusion that it was 
working, after all, but that the fre- 
quency on which it was operating 
was simply not monitored any 
longer. He explored further around 
the craft, and came across the 
prime audio log. » 

Maybe that would give him a 
clue, he reasoned. He thumbed it 
back to the beginning of the record, 
then turned it to “play.” 

“Ben Tom Pertin,” it whispered 
in his earplug, “reporting on land- 
ing on surface of Cuckoo.” 

Hearing his own voice in his ears 
gave him a thrill of unexpected un- 
ease; that voice came from vocal 
chords that had once lodged in that 
blue-smeared skeleton before him. 
But the voice was going on: 

“First entry into atmosphere ac- 
complished without. difficulty; ini- 
tial target, anomalous formations 
on top of mountain. I landed but 
did not exit from vehicle because of 
low air pressure at this altitude. 
The top of the mountain is bare 
rock covered in places by a blue 
lichen or greasy substance of some 



sort, which glowed quite brightly. I 
observed the anomalous formations 
and have photographed them for 
transmission. I do not understand 
them. There appears to be a sort of 
crater on top of this mountain. It is 
clearly not volcanic; there is nothing 
resembling a lava flow, outgassing 
or anything else indicating volcanic 
activity. On the crater lips are some 
truncated cones that have the ap- 
pearance of being artifacts . 
There was a click, and then the 
voice resumed: “The viewports of 
the vehicle have begun to cloud 
over and vision is impaired. I do 
not know the cause of this. Perhaps 
it is due to temperature differen- 
tials causing deposit of fog. As I 
cannot leave the vehicle I am break- 
ing off this section of the survey and 
attempting a landing at a lower 
altitude.” 

There was another click, and 
then the voice resumed — but a dif- 
ferent, fearful, worried voice now: 
“Report two. Vision has not im- 
proved. I was forced to fly and land 
by radar, and landed with some 
difficulty. I do not know if the 
vehicle is damaged. The blue ma- 
terial appears to be covering the 
viewports. I will reconnoiter outside 
and return for further report.” 
Click ... 

And then nothing, nothing but 
the faint distant hiss of the recorder 
coil unwinding under the scanner 
heads. 

Ben Yale let it run through, hop- 
ing against hope for more word, 



126 



GALAXY 




but there was none. He had known 
there would not be. He could write 
the rest of the story himself. He 
stood at the port of the vehicle, 
looking out at the great yellow- 
tipped trees, the marshland and 
moss, the distant river. He could 
imagine that other he standing in 
that place and looking at that same 
view, and venturing out to explore 
this strange new world . and 
never noticing the blue slime that 
clung to him as he swabbed experi- 
mentally at the viewports or 
steadied himself against the landing 
skids. And then, later, trying to get 
back to the vehicle and medicpacs, 
and not quite making it — as the 
skeleton outside attested . 

Ben Yale scowled, rubbing ab- 
sently at his bandages, refusing to 
entertain the unwanted thought 
that kept popping into his head: 
suppose this other Ben Pertin had 
indeed used the medicpacs . 
and suppose modern galactic medi- 
cine had not been enough to stop 
the inroads of the blue slime . 

B elatedly Ben Yale became 
aware of the excitement outside. 
What were they rattling on about? 

He activated the Pmal translator 
on his arm and managed to catch a 
few words of what the giant was 
shouting. Something about aliens 
in the sky? 

At once Ben Yale was all atten- 
tion. Suddenly he became aware of 
the zzzzt of laser weapons, the 
screams of those creatures like the 



one the boy appeared to keep for a 
pet. Something was going on, but 
what? 

Ben Yale Pertin leaped to the top 
of the vehicle, staring up at the sky. 
Yes, there was something there, 
tantalizingly at the very limit of 
visibility. Squinting, he thought he 
made out something that looked 
like tiny dots proceeding in file 
across the broad dome of Cuckoo’s 
heaven. They were near some bright 
clouds in Pertin’s line of vision, 
which made identification even 
harder; but surely that one creature 
glinting so brilliantly had to be one 
of the winged girls. 

And that other — was it human? 

He stood benumbed until he 
heard the screams of wild orgs 
passing overhead. Then he remem- 
bered to scramble out of sight just 
in time; he did not want them 
dining off him! Without any partic- 
ular interest he saw the boy’s org 
join them, and then realized some- 
thing more was going on overhead. 

The straight line of beings had 
broken up. Several were dropping 
away, the others changing course. 
He heard a scream of high-speed 
transport, caught the distant glint 
of air vehicles moving in toward the 
dissolving party of creatures. 

Ben Yale Pertin pawed at his 
forehead, forgetting for a moment 
that the visor was gone. The red- 
haired giant had it, now seemed to 
be playing with it. Pertin bounded 
over and grabbed for the device. 

To his surprise, the giant fled 



THE ORG’S EGG 



127 




from him, fled as though Ben Yale 
were carrying the plague. “Give me 
my glasses!” he roared, pursuing. 
The giant ripped off words the 
Pmal struggled over before produc- 
ing: 

“Don’t touch. Stay away. I’ll 
kill!” 

“They’re mine,” Pertin said 
stubbornly. Redlaw hesitated, 
glanced at the boy, shrugged, then 
slowly drew the visor from his head. 
He did not hand it directly to Ben 
Yale but dropped it on the ground 
and stepped quickly back. 

Ben Yale did not care. He 
snatched it up, donned it, stared at 
the sky. 

It was so hard to find anything at 
this extreme distance! Twice he 
caught a corner of one of the bright 
clouds, and the magnified light 
dazzled him. Then he located 
something, lost it, zeroed in on it 
again. It was a vessel like the ones 
the giant had called “watcher 
ships.” It looked ugly and danger- 
ous, and it was heading purpose- 
fully, at high speed, toward-where 
the party of dots had been sailing 
along. He sought the party again, 
without success until he heard the 
thrump - thrump - thrump of an 
athodyd. Peering under the glasses, 
he saw the string of steam-puffs the 
personal jet left behind, and man- 
aged to get the person using it in 
quick focus just a moment before 
she dropped out of sight. 

Yes. She. She dropped out of 
sight. 



Ben Yale stood transfixed, heed- 
less of the shouts of the boy and the 
giant. He gazed into now empty sky 
where he had just seen, diving at 
breakneck speed for the jungle, the 
girl he had left behind him on Sun 
One. The girl he had thought never 
to see again in this life. Zara Doy. 

XIV 

W hen Zara realized that she 
was alone on this strange 
planet, she was not so much afraid 
as deeply resentful. She had not 
had much practice with physical 
fear. There was little occasion for it 
on tamed, human-filled Earth. The 
sorts of fear she had learned to ex- 
perience were of a different kind. 
Fear of the unknown, for example, 
as when she had volunteered for 
this assignment — and that had been 
more excitement than fear, really. 
And from time to time the fear — or 
the angry suspicion, to be more 
exact — that some rival was going to 
damage her standing with the 
stereo audiences. Or the fear that 
she might fail to perform well in a 
broadcast. 

It was only as time passed, and 
the sole nearby sounds she heard 
were of stirrings and whisperings in 
the forest around her, that she 
began to understand that the quiv- 
ering in her shoulders, the jumpy 
need to look around all three 
hundred and sixty degrees at once, 
were the beginnings of terror. 

She was not quite alone, though. 



128 



GALAXY 




She had her communications 
equipment. She could be in touch 
with the ground station if she 
wanted to. She might even hear, 
through the Pmal links, some 
message from her partners, if they 
happened to come close enough to 
her. But nothing came from the 
Pmal, and she drew her hand back 
a dozen times from the switch that 
would activate the long-range com- 
municator. Something had drawn 
those enemy ships toward the party. 
Were the ships following down its 
transmissions? She did not know, 
but was reluctant to risk bringing 
back the enemy craft. 

And she could hear them, could 
even catch glimpses from time to 
time of what had to be them, a 
good distance off, circling low over 
the treetops, searching. Searching, 
she felt quite sure, for such of their 
quarry as had evaded them — like 
herself. 

What had become of the others? 

Of only one thing was she sure: 
in the fight, her side had not 
triumphed. Because there the 
stranger ships were, roaming boldly 
around. Val and the Arcturan had 
lost that battle, and if they had sur- 
vived they too were in hiding. 

She thought of her husband and 
wondered if he had taken part in 
the combat or if, at the last mo- 
ment, he had sheared off and 
followed her. She reached two 
conclusions. If he had followed her, 
he should be nearby. If he had not, 
he was probably dead . 



She frowned. The distant drone 
of the enemy ships was no longer 
wholly distant. 

She crept to the edge of a fern- 
bordered lake and peered cautious- 
ly upward. The drone grew louder; 
a ceaseless, crushing, killing sound. 
Something appeared over the trees. 

It was a long tapered shape with 
finlike wings at the tail end and 
mottled markings that were no 
doubt a form of camouflage. It 
poked into the little circle of sky 
over the lake like a hovering spear. 

Zara Gentry cautiously pulled 
back, away from the black water of 
the lake and into the doubtful shel- 
ter of the trees. The watcher ship 
floated out over the lake, support- 
ing itself easily with the thrust of its 
propulsive jets against the light 
gravity of Cuckoo. A thin golden 
snake was trailing below it, slipping 
around the treetops, dropping into 
the black water. Some sort of 
snooper device, Zara guessed, and 
tried to be perfectly still. 

The mottled vessel slowed still 
more, the golden snake growing 
slack in the water, seeming to 
writhe around as it sought for 
something to strike at. Inch by inch 
Zara crept backward until she was 
wholly covered by a patch of great 
vines bearing bright blue flowers. 
She was not alone in her hiding 
place. Strange insects were there 
too, and welcomed her presence en- 
thusiastically as a source of nour- 
ishment. 

The mottled ship dropped gently 



THEORG’S EGG 



129 




to the beach and came to rest, not 
more than fifty yards away. A wide 
door fell open in its side and be- 
came a lowered gangplank. 

Zara could not help gasping at 
what came out. T’Worlies, She- 
liaks, Sirians and all had not pre- 
pared her for the hideousness of the 
creatures crewing the ship. First to 
disembark was an armored, black- 
beaked, hunchbacked creature that 
waddled out across the lowered 
platform and flapped down to the 
beach on stubby yellow wings. 

Zara wriggled uncomfortably, 
trying to dislodge small bloodsuck- 
ing insects from her skin, at the 
same time uneasily conscious of a 
noxious smell. For an instant she 
could not identify it. Then it hit her 
hard — a foul odor of carrion and 
decay, even at this distance strong 
enough to turn her stomach, was 
coming from the creature on the 
beach. 

The thing flopped awkwardly 
into the air and flew around the 
perimeter of the lake. Zara willed 
herself to look down without mov- 
ing a muscle. The reek was over- 
powering as the creature flapped 
overhead. 

The flapping sounds and the 
reek receded, and dared to look up. 
She saw that the watcher had 
returned to the beach. It shrilled 
some message at the unseen crew of 
the brown-mottled ship, and slowly 
other creatures like it began to 
come through the dark doorway. 
One by one they vaulted across the 



flat platform and glided into a 
ragged circle around the first 
watcher. 

They engaged in a colloquy of 
whistles and screeches, until an- 
other appeared from the ship and 
hopped and flew down to them with 
what looked like a bundle of white 
staves or lances. It passed them out 
to the others, then squealed some- 
thing. All rose hooting into the air. 

Z ara realized she was in des- 
perate trouble. This was a 
search party, no doubt of it, and 
more likely than not she was the 
quarry. Perhaps they had seen her 
dive into the forest here, or perhaps 
she had given herself away in some 
other manner. No matter; they 
were intent on a trail, and at the 
end of it would be Zara Doy 
Gentry. 

She whimpered in fear, trying to 
decide what to do. But her choices 
were so few! She could use the laser 
weapon at her belt, hoping to kill a 
few of the creatures before the rest 
killed her. She could try to flee — 
but where? And with what hope of 
success? Or she could continue to 
cower in her bower of vines, being 
eaten alive by the tiny insects, until 
the ugly invaders found her . 

And likely they would find her 
soon. Already one of the watchers 
was circling near her. She heard it 
shriek almost overhead, saw the 
bright-spotted blackness of its slick 
hard body, saw the flash of its 
yellow wings. She could not tell 



130 



GALAXY 




which way its bulging greenish eyes 
were looking, but for a moment she 
thought it had seen her. 

Then its great pliant ears cupped 
toward something ahead. Squeal- 
ing, it flapped out of sight, bran- 
dishing its long white staff. She 
gasped with relief, although the 
creature’s evil reek had her on the 
point of vomiting. 

She lay quiet. The hoots and 
squeals of the searchers kept up an 
insane yammering all around her. 
At long last the noises seemed to 
concentrate and recede. 

She dared to peer out, saw that 
one by one the creatures were land- 
ing near their vessel.' 

Had they given up the search? 
Were they about to vanish into 
their ship and take off? 

She crawled out of the tangle of 
vines to see better. They were in a 
confused, bickering huddle around 
the ship. The golden snake that 
had hung into the water was wrig- 
gling insanely about, touching them 
and recoiling, darting into the 
underbrush and coming blindly 
back. They ignored it. They seemed 
to come to some conclusion, then, 
and two of them leaped ponderous- 
ly onto the platform and waddled 
into the ship. 

In a moment they reappeared, 
bearing great platters of what 
looked like raw meat. They dropped 
down in their ungainly way to the 
beach and began to parcel out bits 
of meat among their fellows. 

It was lunchtime, Zara realized. 



Their table manners — even allow- 
ing for the fact that they had no 
table — were atrocious. They bick- 
ered and fought over the choicer 
pieces, throwing the bones and 
offal carelessly into the woods. The 
squealing noises did not stop while 
they ate; they clearly had no com- 
punctions about talking with their 
mouths full, if indeed so gross a 
species had compunctions about 
anything. 

At that point it occurred to Zara 
that she had been thinking of them 
as animals. 

But they were not animals. They 
used advanced technology. They 
communicated among themselves. 

And if she were able to get a little 
closer to them, her Pmal translator 
might be able to pick up enough 
from their squeals and screeches to 
give her some idea of what they 
communicated. 

With agonizing care she slipped 
along the margin of the lake, eyes 
firmly on the feeding watchers, 
until she was less than a dozen 
yards from the sandy beach where 
they had landed. She activated the 
Pmal and held it to her ear. It 
would take time for it to store up 
enough speech to be able to deduce 
meanings, but it should only be a 
few minutes before it could at least 
identify and translate a few 
words . 

Time was growing short. They 
were close to finishing their meal. 
Filthy though the creatures were, a 
few had evidently been detailed to 



THEORG’S EGG 



131 




the task of cleaning up — to hide 
their tracks? They were picking up 
left-over pieces that happened to 
have fallen to the beach or the plat- 
form of the ship. One flapped and 
waddled toward her. 

She became conscious of her ex- 
posed position, but the watcher did 
not seem interested in exploring the 
undergrowth. It was only looking 
for a place to dump its tray of slop. 
It did so, and turned away. 

For just a moment Zara felt a 
quick thrill of relief. 

Then she saw what the slop con- 
sisted of. 

“Dear God!” she moaned aloud, 
unable to stop herself. 

The hooting and squealing rose 
like a barnyard chorus as the 
watchers caught the sound. 
Hopping, flapping their great 
yellow wings, they came at her. But 
the golden snake hung from their 
ship writhed faster than any of 
them. Before she could move it had 
slipped across the beach with the 
sinewave wriggle of a sidewinder, 
touched her gently, then locked on 
her. 

She was held so tightly she could 
hardly breathe, much less run. 

But she had not been able to run 
before that, either — not run, not 
even stand up. Not since looking at 
the trash and offal the creature 
was throwing away, and seeing one 
rounded bit of waste, melon-sized 
and bloody, roll languorously to- 
ward her and stop . 

She knew then what these crea- 



tures had been feeding on. She was 
looking at the severed head of her 
husband. 

The next moments for Zara were 
a desert of half-understood misery. 
The choking coils of the golden 
rope seemed to have intelligence of 
their own as they wrapped them- 
selves around her, bearable when 
she was still, tightening cruelly with 
every move she made to work them 
off. She was tumbled face-down on 
the talc-white beach, with the 
hideous squeals and hoots of the 
watchers piping querulously or 
menacingly all around her, their 
foul reek choking her nostrils. All 
that was painful. What was un- 
bearable was the memory of the 
empty staring eyes of her husband 
fixed on eternity. If Zara had been 
asked to describe her marriage, 
back on Earth, she would have de- 
fended it as a convenient thing cost- 
ing little to maintain and, if it gave 
little in return, no burden to her. 
His death had killed no part of her- 
self. But it was unbearable never- 
theless, unbearable to see this close 
person destroyed so callously, used 
so demeaningly, to stuff the maws 
of these filthy creatures. 

It was only then that Zara began 
to realize she might share that same 
fate herself. 

She struggled to turn over, free 
her mouth from the choking sand. 
The golden coils punished her, but 
gasping and panting she managed 
to flop onto her side. “Please!” she 
begged. “I mean you no harm. 



132 



GALAXY 




Give me that metal thing there — it 
will let us talk to each other.” And 
she tried, at terrible cost of agony 
as the golden coils remorselessly 
fought her movements, to point to 
the Pmal translator, whispering 
away to itself on the sand. 

The hideous mask-faces thrust 
themselves at her, hooting and 
whistling. She knew what they said 
was language of a sort, and it was 
frustration to know that a few yards 
away the Pmal was surely translat- 
ing faithfully every word — but in- 
audibly, because she had set the 
sound low lest they hear her. 
“Please,” she screamed as one 
came near her with a great curved 
cleaver. It paused, seeming to enjoy 
her fear. The gabbling whistles and 
honks burst like laughter around 
her. 

She closed her eyes and tried to 
remember her brief training. What 
were her options? Talking was use- 
less, with the Pmal gone. Her laser 
weapon was long since taken away. 
They had left her only the instru- 
ments strapped to her arms — 
medicpac, chronometer, communi- 
cator . 

Communicator! 

She took a deep breath and 
forced herself to relax. She lay still 
as stone for long seconds, remem- 
bering where the transmit switch 
was on the communicator, feeling 
with her body-image senses where 
her hands were, where the switch 
was. There would not be much free- 
dom of action. 



Then she flung herself onto her 
back, forcing her hands together, 
clawing with the fingers of her right 
hand for the forearm of her left. 

The golden coils responded at 
once by tightening so violently that 
she thought she felt bones snap; 
but she had touched the switch. 
“Help!” she screamed. “This is 
Zara Doy Gentry calling. Help. 
Please. Help me!” 



ahundred-odd degrees of arc 
,f\. distant on the great bulk of 
Cuckoo, Ben Line Pertin was talk- 
ing to himself. 

On his watch duty, desolately 
killing time while trying to solve the 
insoluble problem of what to do 
about the wife that was not his, he 
had observed a curiosity. The comm 
frequency that had been aban- 
doned— because no transmissions 
had been received and its owner, 
that other avatar of himself named 
Ben Tom Pertin, was presumed 
dead — had suddenly come back to 
life. 

When he first beheld himself he 
was aghast. This devastated face, 
harried, sick and in pain, was him- 
self! “Ben Tom!” he cried. “What’s 
the matter?” 

The face in the stereo stage re- 
flected annoyance. “I’m not Ben 
Tom,” it snapped. “And I don’t 
know what you mean. What’s the 
matter with you people? I've been 
trying to call you for — I don’t 
know, for days!” 



THEQRG’SEGG 



133 




“Sorry,” said Ben Line Pertin. 
“But what do you mean, you’re not 
Ben Tom?” 

The ravaged face split in an un- 
pleasant smile. “Glad I’m not,” he 
said. “Ben Tom’s dead. I’m Ben 
Yale. Remember? When you — 
we — volunteered for the sixth time? 
Well, that’s me. I lost my ship, 
nearly lost my life. I’ve been 
through hell, Ben Line! But at that 
I’m better off than Ben Tom, be- 
cause his bones are twenty feet 
away from me. This is his ship I’ve 
found; my own was destroyed, com- 
munications and all.” 

“You look as though you’ve been 
through hell,” Ben Line agreed fer- 
vently. “What are those ban- 
dages?” 

The walking skeleton looked in- 
curiously at his arms and legs. 
“Oh, some sort of fungus, I think,” 
he said. “It itches. Hurts, too, but 
I’ve blocked it with stuff from the 
medicpac. I imagine I’ll need treat- 
ment.” 

“Well,” cried Ben Line, finding 
something to be cheerful about for 
the first time in some days, “I think 
I’ve got good news for you, Ben 
Yale. We’ve just been transmitting 
a new-model exploring ship to the 
ground station. This one’s armed 
and armored, ready for anything. 
And it’s got full ground-to-space 
capability! We can get it over to you 
and have you up here in orbit in jig 
time — as soon as it’s ready.” 

“Fine,” said Ben Yale — 
strangely, thought his duplicate; 



why wasn’t he more excited. But he 
was looking narrowly at Ben Line. 
He said at last, tangentially, “Have 
you heard anything from Zara?” 

Ben Line shook his head. Then 
he corrected himself. “Yes, as a 
matter of fact I did,” he said. “I 
don’t remember — did you split off 
before I got her message about not 
coming because she was preg- 
nant?” 

“Pregnant?” Ben Yale demand- 
ed. “I don’t believe it!” 

“Well, it’s true. That is — it’s 
true of our Zara. But there’s an- 
other copy of her — ” He stopped. 
He was not sure how much he 
wanted to say. 

“On Cuckoo, right?” cried Ben 
Yale. “I knew it! I saw her, Ben 
Line. She’s in trouble. Not more 
than five thousand yards from here, 
bearing two seventy- four degrees!” 

“Trouble? No, I don’t think so,” 
Ben Line said. 

“Don’t be a fool, Ben Line,” 
cried his avatar. “I tell you, I saw 
her!” 

Ben Line Pertin hesitated, filled 
with confusion and a painful mix- 
ture of hope and fear. Another 
Zara, so close? But in danger? 

“Stand by,” he said. “I’ll scan 
that vector.” And his fingers 
danced over his console to farlink, 
ordering a search for transmissions 
from a point five thousand yards, at 
bearing 274°, from Ben Yale’s 
signal. 

From her perch across the con- 
sole from him, Venus sat quietly 



134 



GALAXY 




regarding Ben Line. “What is the 
matter?” she asked, spraying a tiny 
violet cloudlet from her atomizer. 

He shook his head as the rich 
menthol scent reached him. “It’s 
Zara,” he said. “Something I don’t 
understand. And one of my repli- 
cates down there, looking — well, I 
don’t know what’s keeping him 
alive.” 

“1 ache with your pains,” said 
Venus softly. Though her dark 
stare had always seemed blankly 
opaque, he felt her compassion 
coming through it. “So difficult for 
you, to see yourself. I have at least 
been spared that. I have no contact 
with my replicates, save one or 
two — and then, for one of us to die 
in this edited form would not be 
bad.” 

Distracted, Ben Line scowled at 
the console. There was no response 
to the search although he could see 
that the program was functioning. 
Lately he had found it more and 
more difficult to distinguish sleep 
from waking. His sleep was filled 
with troubled dreams, and his wak- 
ing life was a nightmare. 

The dreams lingered with him 
even when he was awake. He shiv- 
ered, remembering one dream — 

scan unsuccessful, reported 
farlink’s screen, unidentified 

TRANSMISSIONS FROM AREA. 

“Continue,” snapped Ben Line, 
reinforcing the verbal order with 
his keyboard. 

And he stared into space, re- 
membering that one dream. 



I n it he had been a child again. 

On Earth. Not the Earth he had 
left — so many replications be- 
fore! — but the Earth he imagined, 
as it had been before the first 
contact with the galactic civiliza- 
tions. He had been sitting at a 
child’s desk, in an upstairs room 
with an open window, looking out 
over a sunny yard, reading a book, 
when something had come in from 
outside. It had fluttered through 
the window, alighted on the page in 
front of him. When he had raised a 
hand to slap it, it had leaped away 
and he had seen it was no common 
fly but a tiny five-eyed bat shape 
with bright butterfly wings. When 
he had heard it squeaking, had 
caught its faint vinegar scent, he 
had known it was a T’Worlie — in- 
congruously there in that pre-galac- 
tic age, but somehow Earth’s first 
visitor from deep space. 

He had seized a flyswatter to kill 
it. Its shrill scream of protest had 
hurt his ears, and its fear had been 
a carrion reek. Wings whirring, it 
had risen to fly away but he had 
smashed it on the open page. 

For a moment, now, he felt se- 
cure in that dream. Then he re- 
membered the rest of it . 

He had heard a droning roar 
from outside. The sun had darken- 
ed. Shadows had filled with win- 
dow. When he had looked out, he 
had seen that the sky had turned 
black with alien beings descend- 
ing — T’Worlie and Sheliaks, Boaty- 
Bits and Scorpians, endless proces- 



THEORG’S EGG 



135 




sions of a thousand shapes and 
sizes all arrowing down upon him . 

He had wakened then briefly, 
tossed and turned, drifted off 
again . 

To even worse horror. 

He had dreamed then that he 
was his other self, Replicate 5154, 
at the strange tachyonic station to 
which he had been transmitted. 
But his form had no longer been 
human. He had been edited, trans- 
formed into a thick metal block, 
unable to move. He had understood 
at last — attempting to shudder, 
and failing — the silvery girl’s ab- 
horrence of the form into which her 
own body had been recast to survive 
in an oxygen atmosphere. His case 
had been worse. He had become a 
chess piece in a three-sided match; 
he stood on a queer triangular 
game board, a hapless piece in a 
game that farlink played against 
two terrible opponents. 

One opponent was a bright thing 
of lambent white flame, writhing 
and twisting and flickering, with- 
out any ordered shape. The other 
was equally shapeless; but black 
instead of bright. They reached 
across the board with curling 
tongues of bright fire and terrible 
empty blackness, as if to move their 
pieces; but Ben Line could not see 
their pieces, only the ones on his 
own side: One was the pseudo- 
girl Venus, her silver body frozen 
and rigid. Another was Zara Doy, 
alive and moving but imprisoned 
under a bell-jar, pale and gasping, 



agonized for air. A third was Doc 
Chimp, a lifeless figure in brightly 
painted metal like a cheap child’s 
toy, holding out a tin cup. The 
pieces moved, or the board itself 
perhaps moving them, responding 
to farlink’s rapped electronic 
orders; but farlink was losing the 
game. Most of its triangular spaces 
were already empty. The last move 
had isolated Ben Line far from his 
companions. A fluttering tentacle 
of icy blackness stretched out to- 
ward him, and he knew that it was 
going to remove him from the 
board and then the game would be 
ultimately, irretrievably lost . 

“Ben Line,” chimed the voice of 
the silvery girl, “where are you?” 

He came back to the reality of 
the orbiter and the screen. “Sorry, 
Venus,” he muttered. “I was think- 
ing about . .” His voice died out, 
but hers picked up the thought 
from him: 

“About that other Ben Pertin? 
About Replicate 5154? About all 
those others of you, Ben Line?” 

He nodded. There had been no 
other signal from the copy of him- 
self sent back along the tachyon 
trace to whatever that galactic 
source of interference had been: 
one more dead Pertin, he thought; 
the universe is getting seriously pol- 
luted with my corpses . 

He sat up abruptly and realized 
farlink was still methodically 
scanning the surface of Cuckoo for 
a signal that did not seem to be 
coming. He sighed and reached 



136 



GALAXY 




from the console to terminate the 
program — 

And at that moment the screen 
lit up: 

STAND BY. CARRIER FREQUENCY 
DETECTED. NO COMMUNICATION AS 
YET. 

And while his fingers were still 
poised over the console he heard it. 
There was no doubt. 

On the emergency frequency. 

Zara’s voice. 

And the words: 

“Help! This is Zara Doy Gentry 
calling. Help. Please. Help me!” 

At virtually the same moment, in 
the wrecked survey vessel on the 
surface, Ben Yale Pertin heard 
Zara’s voice repeated from the 
orbiter. That voice had traveled 
nearly half a billion miles, round 
trip, to get to him, but on the in- 
stant flash of tachyon transmission 
it had taken less time than was 
measurable. The time the message 
had taken to travel from the 
speaker on the satellite to the 
microphone three yards away that 
had picked it up was longer than 
the time for the message to fly on 
the backs of tachyons through 
space. 

He burst out of the vehicle, 
limping and rubbing at his ban- 
dages, but traveling as fast as ever 
he had in his life. He was not in 
pain now. He had been steadily 
doping himself with pills and salves 
from the medicpac; he was no 
longer quite sober or sane. Al- 
though the pain of the ulcers under 



the bandages was blocked, the ef- 
fects of the blocks were shaking the 
stability of his mind. All things 
seemed possible. The entire uni- 
verse seemed ready to meet his 
commands. He scrambled through 
the undergrowth toward Redlaw 
and Org Rider, shouting, ‘‘My 
wife! She’s in danger. We’ve got to 
help her.” 

XV 

y~vRG rider was too full of mourn- 
ing for the loss of Babe to feel 
any great concern about the dying 
stranger’s excitement — until Red- 
law translated some of that queer 
speech. 

“I do not understand all,” said 
Redlaw. “But it is a woman of his 
people and she is captive of the 
watchers. I expect they will eat 
her,” he added, moodily stroking 
his cleaver. “He wishes us to save 
her. And he says, too, that if we do 
this a great ship of his people will 
come to battle the watchers for us.” 
Redlaw paused, uncertain. “I do 
not know if he is telling the truth,” 
he said. “He is a dying man. Per- 
haps he has the madness of the dy- 
ing?" 

Org Rider shrugged, but he was 
thinking about what Redlaw had 
said. With Babe gone, he was not 
happy enough to care much about 
danger. And the woman the 
stranger spoke about. If she were 
the one he had seen so briefly as she 
had dashed herself into the tree- 



THEORG’SEGG 



137 




tops — but was that possible? Could 
she have survived that nightmare 
plunge? No matter; if it were she, 
there had been something about 
her that had appealed powerfully to 
him. 

He said mournfully, “What does 
it matter? Let us do as he asks. 
Where is this woman?” 

Redlaw scowled, gestured toward 
the slopes of Knife-in-the-Sky. “He 
says he knows precisely and will 
show us. But how can he travel? I 
have seen men before, eaten alive 
by that blue slime. They do not 
travel through the jungle! But he is 
doing it. It is something in those 
cloths he puts on his ulcers, per- 
haps, or in those small things he 
eats and drinks from the metal box. 
I wish 1 knew — ” Redlaw gazed 
doubtfully at Ben Yale Pertin, still 
shouting and gesticulating at them 
to hurry. “And there is so much 
more he says that I cannot under- 
stand.” 

“No matter,” said Org Rider. 
“Let us save the woman. For him,” 
he added politely, as an after- 
thought. 

Even so, they were far too slow 
for Ben Yale’s liking; and then the 
trek through the jungle was longer 
and harder than they had expected, 
more than two thousand breaths, 
because Ben Yale insisted that they 
wait for him. He chose to carry 
some great metal thing from the 
ship that he called “bazooka.” It 
was a wonder he could move at all, 
even without that weight. Beneath 



the stained bandages — though he 
had replaced them just before they 
had left — the blue slime oozed out, 
always spreading, always etching 
new ulcers into his flesh. And it was 
a constant peril to be near him 
during his clumsy lunging through 
the trees. A single accidental touch 
of the blue slime might mean death 
for either of the others. 

But the two thousand breaths 
elapsed, and they had reached a 
point from which they could see the 
distant black gleam of the tiny 
lake. There on the far shore loomed 
the mottled hulk of the watcher 
vessel. 

Org Rider wished for the farsee- 
ing glasses, but of course they were 
no longer safe to use: Ben Yale had 
touched them. He squinted across 
the lake. With mounting excite- 
ment he saw — yes, there she was! — 
the very girl who had dropped from 
the sky. Wrapped like the prey of a 
cord-spinner in the golden coils of 
the watchers’ device, lying helpless 
on the blinding white sands of the 
little beach. 

Even so, even at this distance, 
she was beautiful. Disordered as 
her hair was, it held the reddish 
glint of far lightning. Something 
about her made him think of his 
brother's wife. Yet this girl was 
more beautiful in spite of the 
drained pale cast of her face and 
the terror in her expression. 

EJe glanced at Redlaw, and start- 
ed to move toward the lake. 

The giant stopped him. 



138 



GALAXY 




“Wait!” he rumbled. “Ben Yale 
says he has a plan. He says that this 
‘bazooka’ is a weapon. He wishes 
us to go around the lake, to be 
ready to attack the watchers from 
the forest. He says from here, with 
this weapon that he has carried, he 
will destroy the watcher ship. When 
he has done that, we are to kill 
those who survive with his hand- 
weapon and — ” he patted his 
cleaver — “this one.” 

“What weapon does he have that 
will destroy the ship?” Org Rider 
demanded suspiciously. “You told 
me he had no such weapon.” 

“He lied,” growled the giant 
moodily. “1 knew he lied. And 
perhaps he is lying now, how can I 
tell? I can understand so little of 
what he says.” 

“What does it matter?” repeated 
Org Rider, quelling the surge of 
feeling in himself. “Let us do as he 
asks.” 

T hey left Ben Yale just inside 
the undergrowth, lying on the 
scarlet moss, peering over the 
sights of his treetrunk-like weapon, 
chuckling and muttering to himself 
in his strange language. And they 
moved like ghosts through the vege- 
tation, circling. 

They paused fifty yards from the 
beach. The foul death weed stench 
of the watchers reeked in their nos- 
trils as Org Rider whispered sav- 
agely, “How do we know when he 
will destroy the ship? We should 
have arranged a signal.” 



“Should have, should have,” 
rumbled Redlaw. “But we didn’t, 
boy.” He scowled toward the beach. 
“If only I were sure of him! I hate 
like poison to get closer. Those 
golden ropes of theirs can smell a 
man, and they never sleep. Still — ” 
He sighed. “I’ll try to get them with 
this thing — ” he patted the laser 
weapon— “and you go after them 
with your bow. With any luck 
they’ll be disorganized . .” 

He broke off. There was a sharp, 
flat crack from across the lake and 
a puff of grayish smoke. Out of the 
smoke emerged a needlelike metal 
object lancing across the lake to- 
ward the watcher vessel. It struck, 
and opened into a bright flower of 
flame. 

Blam . 

The sound of the explosion was 
far louder than they had expected. 
The mottled vessel of the watchers 
seemed to lift off the sand and fall 
slowly. Flames spouted from the 
new hole that the stranger’s weapon 
had made in its side. 

“Curse him,” howled Redlaw. 
“We should have been closer. Do 
the best you can, boy.” He loped 
toward the watchers, firing the 
laser weapon. Sounds like the tear- 
ing of paper came from it, and 
watchers fell before it. 

Org Rider ran to the side of the 
lake, dropped to one knee and be- 
gan launching arrows toward the 
watchers. While one was still in the 
air he was notching and aiming the 
next. He did not wait to see how 



THEORG’SEGG 



139 




successful any released arrow was, 
but out of the corner of an eye he 
saw one watcher leap high with a 
startled squeal, a shaft clear 
through him. Another, squawling 
and hooting, lay on the ground, 
tugging at an arrow protruding 
from his throat. 

“They’ve broken!” exulted Red- 
law over his shoulder. “Come on, 
boy. Let’s go in and finish them 
off!” As he spoke his laser weapon 
sliced through the golden coils, and 
another blast from it burned a 
crisply sizzling hole through a 
watcher skull. Now the giant flung 
the laser to the winds and, scream- 
ing as he leaped, bowled in on the 
watchers, hacking at them with his 
cleaver. Org Rider was just behind. 
The two of them drove the watchers 
back like avenging angels. With 
every stroke of Redlaw’s cleaver 
and the boy’s knife a watcher 
squealed and fell from their paths. 

Zzzzzzat! 

The noise was louder than any- 
thing Org Rider had ever heard, 
and for a moment he did not under- 
stand what it was. 

Then he saw that the watcher 
vessel was not, after all, quite dead. 

From a round bulge on its top 
something flashed like lightning, 
and the great ripping sound lashed 
at his ears again. The watcher ship 
was firing its main armament. Not 
at them, Org Rider realized — no 
question about that; if the laser 
cannon had been aimed at them 
they would never have known what 



hit them. The big laser was probing 
across the lake for the bazooka. 
Zzzzzzat. and a beetree went up in 
smoke, smitten by a lightning bolt. 
Zzzzzzat. and a sudden corridor 
opened up in a stand of death- 
weeds. 

“Grab the girl,” bawled Redlaw. 
“Let's get out of here before they 
finish Pertin and start on us.” 

T here were still watchers alive 
and Org Rider yearned to catch 
and kill every one. But he knew 
Redlaw was right. He bounded to 
the side of the girl. She was just be- 
ginning to sit up, numbed and tot- 
tering, after the blood had been 
squeezed out of her limbs for so 
long. 

Org Rider felt as dizzy as she 
was. All this was so terribly new 
and confusing. The needle-bright 
light of the laser, the harsh explo- 
sions and lightning-bolt sizzling of 
the long-range battle across the 
lake, were entirely out of his ex- 
perience, wholly foreign to a life 
lived in the perpetual pink-gray 
dawn of Cuckoo. He was not 
afraid, but he was disoriented. 

Still he had to act. He grabbed 
the girl’s arm and pulled her to her 
feet. She did not resist, except to 
break free for a moment and pick 
up a piece of metallic equipment. 
Then she was with him, bounding 
as fast as he into the shelter of the 
woods, Redlaw close behind. The 
last watcher on his feet outside the 
ship challenged Redlaw, but lost 



140 



GALAXY 




his head and half his trunk to the 
keen-edged cleaver. Then the giant 
was beside them, shouting, “Hurry! 
We must get out of sight.” The girl 
could not have understood his 
words but she did not have to — the 
need was clear. 

At last came another bazooka 
shot from across the lake. This one 
arrived clean and true on the bulge 
at the top of the watcher ship. The 
bulge blew up in a gout of flame. 

All three cheered. 

“We did it, boy!” the giant 
bellowed. “Beat the watchers in 
fair fight! It’s the first time that 
ever happened in all the time of the 
world.” 

Org Rider crowed in pleasure, 
pummeling the girl’s back as 
though she were another man. 
Exultant, laughing, as delighted as 
he, she clapped him on the shoul- 
der with a force that sent him 
spinning. 

He picked himself off the ground 
and looked at her with new respect. 
She was no timid frail maiden. She 
was as strong as he. And yet she 
seemed more feminine than any 
woman he had ever seen. More so 
even than the girl who had married 
his brother. A glow of color began 
to light her death-pale face, and he 
found himself staring into her wid- 
ening eyes. They were a bright- 
flecked brown, like the wild flowers 
that colored the grassworld after a 
rain. Even with the hated reek of 
the watchers still fouling his nos- 
trils he could smell the faint scent 



that came from her, a clean sweet- 
ness that swept away the watchers’ 
fetor and left him with the fra- 
grance of the rain itself after the 
flatworld had been brown and dry. 

“Stop mooning, boy,” Redlaw 
ordered, laughing as he said it. 
“We’ve beaten one shipload of 
watchers, but they’re not through 
yet. There will be more. They’ll 
send another to look for it. If it 
managed to send off a distress re- 
port, that ship is on its way now!” 
Org Rider tore his eyes from the 
girl. “All right. You lead.” 

The giant gazed about. “We’ll 
have to go back around the lake,” 
he decided. “First place, we’d best 
try to find Ben Yale, if he’s still 
alive. Second, I don’t think we can 
get out this side. That’s bare rock 
up there. We’d be easy targets on 
it — and I see blue on those rocks, 
boy; I think it’s the slime. We don’t 
want to go near that.” 

Org Rider nodded and turned to 
the girl. Speaking as clearly as he 
could, gesturing to make his mean- 
ing plain, he said: “Come. We 
leave here. Now.” 

She laughed. She touched the 
metallic thing she had picked up, 
and she spoke, and from the thing 
came a flat dead voice that said: “I 
understand. I agree. And — ” even 
the lifeless metallic tone of the 
Pmal translator could not keep all 
feeling out of the words — “with all 
my heart I thank you both.” 

The boy was enraptured. He 
recognized the speaking machine; 



THEORG’S EGG 



141 




it was the same as Ben Yale’s but 
whole and working properly. Dur- 
ing Ben Y.ale’s conversations with 
Redlaw, the boy had become ac- 
customed to being excluded; it had 
not occurred to him that an un- 
damaged machine would make it 
possible for him to be in one-to-one 
contact with this wondrous person. 

He caught the girl’s hand, and 
they followed Redlaw back toward 
the lake margin — 

And front behind the wrecked 
watcher vessel a lance of green fire 
spat out at them. 

Redlaw shrieked in agony and 
spun away, clutching his arm. 
“Run!” he bawled, setting them as 
example, they blundered after 
him, and at every leap Org Rider 
expected that green fire to burn 
through their backs. 

They stopped at the bare rock 
wall cupping that edge of the lake. 

“There was one still alive,” Red- 
law gasped, holding the place on 
his upper arm that had blossomed 
into a blood-red blister of pain. 
“It’s lucky he fired when he did! If 
he’d waited he would have had me 
clean, and you two as well.” He 
scowled up at the mountain. “We 
can’t go up that way,” he muttered. 
“And we can’t go back to the lake, 
because he’s waiting there.” 

Org Rider risked raising himself 
to peer around the multiple boles of 
a flame-tree. He could see the 
watcher, broad yellow wings slowly 
stirring. One was damaged, and 
dragged; the watcher had been 



hurt, too. But he held the thing 
that looked like a black stick, and 
spat green flame, without faltering. 

“If we can't go forward,” Org 
Rider said, “and can’t go back — 
and can’t stay here because there’ll 
be another watcher ship before 
long — then what do we do?” 

T hey waited and watched, but 
the creature remained stead- 
fastly alert. 

“We have no choice,” Redlaw 
groaned at last. “We have to kill 
him. His gun outranges our wea- 
pons, and his bug-eyes can see us in 
every direction. It won’t be easy.” 
Redlaw scowled at his cleaver. 
“The only way I see to take him 
is to rush from all sides. He might 
kill us all, but I don’t think so. One 
of us will get him. But the other 
two — ” 

He hesitated, then he finished: 
“At least one of the other two will 
be dead.” 

“No!” shouted the boy. “Not 
her. She has suffered enough from 
the watchers. You and I can do it, 
Redlaw.” 

The girl, listening, shook her 
head. She spoke in that pretty, 
singing voice, and the metal voice 
from her arm echoed, “I can do my 
share. I thank you for your good 
heart.” 

Org Rider stared at her and said, 
“Please don’t. I don’t know your 
name — ” 

She said in her own voice, not 
through the translator, “Zara.”

It sounded like music to him as 
he rehearsed it several times, tast- 
ing its flavor. 

“Zara. Please, Zara, don’t do 
this. You are not a warrior. Redlaw 
and I can handle the watcher.” 
The giant thundered, “Idiot boy, 
we can’t. Our only hope is three 
attacks at once. That is a faint 
enough hope — two is suicide!” 

The girl spoke, and the Pmal 
rattled flatly. “It is decided, Org 
Rider. I again thank you, but now 
let us act. Tell me what I must do.” 
The giant rasped, “Come in from 
behind the ship. Get close to him. 
The beast has a hard shell but there 
are soft joints. One is where his 
neck would be, if he had a neck. 
There’s a pale stripe above his 
black hump. Stab him deep in the 
middle of that, if you can.” 

Org Rider watched the girl start 
on her roundabout trip with his 
breath caught in his throat. She 
would not die! He would see to it. 
The first one to display himself to 
the watcher surely would be the 
first one fired on; the other two 
would have a chance at least 
minutely better. Org Rider deter- 
mined to be that first one. 

But it would be foolish, would 
even endanger them, for his break 
to come much before their own. It 
would simply mean that the watcher 
would pick him off quickly and 
then have only two foes to confront. 
So he squirmed to his place and 
waited, watching the faint ripples 
in the underbrush that marked the 



movements of Redlaw and the girl. 
Could the watcher see and under- 
stand those same ripples? The boy 
did not know. He could only hope 
not. 

Something was tugging at the 
back of his mind. What was it? 

Then he recognized the growing 
sound from the sky, and looked up. 
Down at him dived a great org. 

Org Rider froze. It was his death 
he saw coming. With only the knife 
left — the bow was long since cast 
away — he could not prevail against 
talon and fang. All he could do was 
stare at its savage splendor. He 
crouched numbly, waiting for the 
hooked black talons to strike. 

Even in that moment he saw the 
blue beauty of the org’s huge 
hooded eyes, the bright flow of its 
form, the even sheen of bronze 
scales shading into the silver flash 
of its narrowed wings. Wonder at 
its clean sleek power made his 
throat ache. Orgs were better and 
greater than men! Surely they were 
more beautiful. It was his death . 
but if he had to perish, here on 
Knife-in-the-Sky, it was better to 
be killed by this mighty org than by 
the waiting watcher. 

But dying that way would not 
serve Zara . 

Org Rider leaped to his feet, 
yelling and bounding toward the 
watcher ship. 

As he had expected, the watcher 
was staring up with his great eyes, 
distracted by the org. Perhaps after 
the org finished with him it would 



144 



GALAXY 




go for the watcher next! Org Rider 
glanced toward the watcher, hus- 
banding his charges as he nervously 
waited under the shelter of the 
ship, then back toward the org. 

It screamed again. 

The bright wings opened a little, 
flaring the creature toward him out 
of the bottom of the dive, and he 
saw the scars that marred its lean 
perfection. A long, dark wound, 
not fully healed, where the scales 
had been ripped from its flank. A 
break in the brightness of one wide 
wing. 

The screaming changed . and 
queerly, became words. 

“Babe!” blared the mighty voice 
of the org, repeating the boy’s own 
words like a tape under maximum 
gain. “Babe come back!” 

The boy heard his own voice 
thunder down at him from the sky 
and could hardly understand. But 
what the words did not explain the 
actions did. The org dipped down 
over him. Its golden-scaled trunk 
snatched him up into the air, 
squeezed him almost too hard, 
flexed to set him on its back above 
the widened wings. 

Then recognition hit him. 

It was Babe! Changed — older — 
hurt, but Babe! Scales had replaced 
the infant fur. The healing scars 
told of combat. But it was Babe. 

A laser scream spat past the 
boy’s ear and brought him out of 
his dreaming. He kicked the org 
strongly and shouted, “Fast, Babe. 
Over the trees.” 



The beast responded instantly, 
putting the loom of the ship be- 
tween them and the watcher. And 
Org Rider sobbed, “Babe! I’m so 
glad.” He stroked the bronze 
scales. Yards below he could see 
the top of the trees. He caught a 
glimpse of Zara’s terrified pale face 
staring up at them. What could she 
be thinking? Had she ever seen an 
org before? Did she understand 
that Org Rider was master, not 
prey? 

But looking at her brought him 
back to the needs of that moment. 
He wheeled Babe around, low over 
the treetops, and shouted down: 
“Now! Let’s get him!” 

And as he saw the mighty form of 
Redlaw leap free and begin to run 
toward the watcher, he gouged his 
heels into Babe’s scaled side and 
commanded, “Kill, Babe. The 
watcher. Kill him!” 

T he chaos of the next moments 
was indescribable. Org Rider 
heard the shouts of Redlaw and the 
shriller, fainter cry of the girl. He 
saw the cleaver glinting in the 
hands of the giant. 

Then he was around the ship and 
beating back in toward the watcher. 

The black stick crackled. Bright 
light blasted Org Rider’s eyes; a 
sudden electrical stench choked 
him. But it had been a miss. He 
was still alive. 

And then they were on top of the 
watcher. Babe bellowed as his 
striking talons ripped the watcher 



THEORG’S EGG 



145 




out from under the hull. They all 
tumbled in a slow-motion heap: 
boy, org and watcher together. The 
reek of the squealing watcher stung 
the boy’s throat and blurred his 
eyes but he clutched for the being, 
clung, sought to find the death 
place as he stabbed and stabbed 
with his knife. 

In the end it was Babe that took 
the last of the life from the watcher, 
the great claws simply wrenching 
the hideous head free of its body. 
The shrilling scream sputtered and 
stopped abruptly, and the ugly 
carcass toppled slowly forward in 
death. 

“We did it!” Org Rider called. 
“Babe, you’re a hero. Babe — ” 

But the org did not respond. 

Shaken, Org Rider lifted his 
head free and stared. The delicate 
pink trunk was trembling violently. 
The huge eyes were dulled. As Org 
Rider reached out to touch him. 
Babe screamed in pain. 

The watcher’s laser lance had 
found a mark after all. 

As Redlaw and the girl came 
running up, Babe fumbled out to 
touch the boy with his shuddering 
trunk. The voice that mimicked 
Org Rider’s own said, “Babe go. 
Babe go . .” 

And the light went out of the 
great eyes, and the org was dead. 

Org Rider sat mourning with the 
great head in his lap, Redlaw and 
the girl standing helplessly by, until 
at last Redlaw rumbled, “Sorry, 
boy, but we’ve got to get out of 



here. The watchers will be after us 
any time now.” 

Org Rider looked up and nodded 
somberly. “I know.” He got up, 
reaching a hand to the girl. “Are 
you all right?” She smiled, in both 
reassurance and compassion; he 
needed no translator to under- 
stand. 

There was a sudden scream of 
high speed from the sky, and all 
three of them looked upward in in- 
stant reawakened fear. 

“Too late!" raged Redlaw. 
“Fiends of hell! There’s the watcher 
ship on us, while we’re standing 
around like fools. We can’t get 
away now. We’ll have to fight — and 
we’ve nothing to fight with but the 
watcher’s own lance!” He dove to 
the side of the decapitated beast, 
choking from fury as much as from 
the evil cloud of its deathweed 
stink. 

The girl stopped him. 

Her clear voice, repeated through 
the translator on her arm, said: 

“It’s all right. It’s not a watcher 
ship. Look.” 

Redlaw and the boy craned their 
necks. 

The vehicle that was settling 
down was far larger than any 
watcher ship either had ever seen. 
Even the colors were different. 
Bright silver, crisp black, a flare of 
yellow-white gas from the under- 
jets. 

“They’ve come to rescue us,” 
said Zara. “We’re safe now. All of 
us.” 



146 



GALAXY 




I n the orbiter, Ben Line Pertin 
watched in a fever of excitement 
as the survey ship picked up Zara 
and her two companions. He stared 
at her image in pain and wonder. 
So tall and thin she was, in her 
edited version! So worn and pale, 
the stresses of her battle with the 
watchers plainly showing. He want- 
ed desperately to talk to her, to say 
words of love and welcome. But al- 
though he was hard-pressed by 
grief and loneliness, he was not 
mad; he understood that their rela- 
tionship would have to mature in its 
own way. To him she was his loved 
and missed wife. To her, coming 
from an earlier Zara Doy, he was a 
stranger. 

And then there was the solved 
puzzle of why she had called herself 
“Zara Doy Gentry.” She had mar- 
ried someone else! He had scarcely 
taken that shock when he had 
learned that that husband was 
dead, fodder for the maws of the 
watchers. Shock again! This time a 
different kind of shock; a reprieve, 
even if purchased at the cost of a 
man’s life. He could not have been 
a bad man, Ben Line told himself 
with one reasoning part of his 
mind, if Zara had married him. 
But another part of his mind was 
bursting with joy. How strange for 
his wife to be a widow and a woo- 
able stranger, all at once! 

And suddenly he was exhausted. 
He had remained by the communi- 
cator for twenty-two hours. Past the 
time of his regular duty, through 



the new Zara’s cry for help, up to 
the moment of rescue and for an 
hour or two beyond. Now he had to 
sleep. Deciding against trying to 
leave a message for this to-be-won 
Zara, he headed for his cocoon. 
There would be opportunity. It was 
a long voyage up from Cuckoo and 
around to where the orbiter swung, 
nearly half a billion miles now. 

Yet there was no way to shorten 
the trip. Even with nuclear rockets, 
the acceleration of the survey ship 
was limited to what its rescued pas- 
sengers could stand. That was not 
much. Redlaw and Org Rider had 
lived all their lives in the gentle pull 
of Cuckoo, and even Zara and Ben 
Yale Pertin, in their edited ver- 
sions, could hardly take a single 
gravity of acceleration. For Ben 
Yale even that would be quite dan- 
gerous; he had been swept from the 
jungle into full medical cocooning 
instantly. 

Ben Line fell asleep, thinking of 
Ben Yale coming up from Cuckoo, 
battered and foul with the ulcers of 
the blue slime . and of that 
other Ben Pertin, Replicate 5154, 
lost somewhere at the transmitter 
of the tachyon interference, at a 
point unknown inside the galaxy . 
and above all of the sweet and 
smiling face of Zara Doy, now Zara 
Gentry, who might some time soon 
be Zara Pertin again . 

He woke to Doc Chimp scream- 
ing in his ear: 

“Ben. Ben Line. Wake up! 
You’ve been found, you’re still 



THEORG’S EGG 



147 




alive. Oh, wake up, Ben Line 
Pertin — there’s a signal from you 
coming in!” 

Heavy with sleep, Ben Line Per- 
tin stumbled after Doc Chimp to 
the terminal dome. Ben Line’s 
mind was fuzzed with visions of 
himself in all his myriad guises. 
Sometimes he was not sure which 
he was: the innocent back on Earth 
who had never left, the one on Sun 
One still happily married to Zara 
Doy and happy father of her child, 
or any of the dead ones ... all of 
them ... 

But one dead one was not dead! 

In the dome, the huge image of a 
haggard human face was repeated 
on half a hundred screens all 
around the curve. Part of the face 
was haggard with dirt and grime. 
The rest was caked with dark 
blood; a ragged wound on the scalp 
still oozed, untended. 

It took Ben Pertin a moment to 
recognize himself: Replicate 5154. 

“See!” chirped Doc Chimp in his 
ear. “It’s you, Ben! Not dead! The 
message started coming in a few 
minutes ago. But it’s awful bad, 
Ben Line. You can’t understand a 
word of it without the Pmal trans- 
lators.” 

Ben Line was still stupid with 
sleep. “You mean I’m — he’s speak- 
ing some other language?” 

“Not that, Ben Line,” said the 
chimpanzee gently. “Look at him! 
He can hardly talk in any language. 
The Pmal has to put it into words 
we can understand. Even then — 



well, it’s in symbol-script, not 
sounds. He must have had some 
bad times, Ben Line.” 

And it was so: the soiled and 
battered mouth was moving, but no 
audible sound came through the 
wall speakers. Instead bright com- 
puter symbols were dancing under 
each screen: 

. INCOMPLETELY EXPLORED. 
IN SHAPE, THIS OBJECT I FOUND 
MYSELF ON IS A LARGE FLAT DISK. 
MAYBE A THOUSAND FEET ACROSS, 
ROTATING SLOWLY. IT’S SOME KIND 
OF SPACECRAFT BUT DOES NOT 
APPEAR TO BE UNDER POWER 
NOW — MAYBE HAS NOT BEEN FOR A 
LONG TIME. 

THE LEVELS TOWARD THE RIM 
ARE SEALED AND COLD. VERY 
COLD. I BELIEVE THE CREW IS 
HIBERNATING THERE TO WAIT FOR 
THE NEXT PLANET LANDING. THERE 
IS ONE PLACE THAT LOOKS LIKE A 
CONTROL ROOM. SPHERICAL. STARS 
IMAGED ON ITS INSIDE SURFACE, 
AND A SORT OF POD HUNG IN THE 

CENTER FOR THE PILOTS BUT 

THERE ARE NO PILOTS. HIBERNAT- 
ING, I GUESS. I COULD NOT IDEN- 
TIFY THE STAR IMAGES BUT I DID 
SEE WHAT LOOKED LIKE A REPRE- 
SENTATION OF CUCKOO. STRANGE. 
ALL MADE OF METAL. NO SOIL, 

ROCKS, SEAS, MOUNTAINS JUST A 

GREAT SPHERE OF METAL. 

I THINK 

The bloodied head turned sud- 
denly and vanished from the screen. 

For an instant the screens were 
dark. Then shapeless blotches of 



148 



GALAXY 




color flickered over them, farlink 
interposed its own message, in all 
the tongues of the viewers: 

TRANSMISSION INTERRUPTED. 
STAND BY. 

There was a sudden rush of 
squeal, cry, shout and roar from 
the beings in the terminal room, as 
each one chattered to its neighbor 
about the message. Ben Line, sick 
at the sight of his destroyed self, 
muttered, “I don’t understand. 
What is it?” 

Venus floated over toward him 
and filled him in quickly. “Your 
replicate reported in a few minutes 
ago, Ben Line. He was in a ship, 
but some sort of mechanical de- 
vice — a robot, and not a fully 
sentient one. I’m sure — attacked 
him as he came out of the receiver, 
and it is only now that he has been 
able to report.” 

“Ship?” Ben Line shook his 
head, trying to clear it. The source 
of the distant unidentified tachyon 
transmission that they had actually 
intercepted en route to Cuckoo — a 
ship? There were no ships equipped 
with tachyon facilities that could 
possibly have a link with Cuckoo, 
not anywhere in the known uni- 
verse . 

Of course, there was always the 
unknown universe, he thought, the 
muscles of his back crawling. 

“And there were representations 
of many beings there, Ben Line,” 
the silvery girl went on excitedly. 
“Your people. Boaty-bits. Sheliaks. 
Your Replicate thinks that the ship 



is a sort of advance guard for 
Cuckoo, sampling inhabited 
planets, sending specimens back. 
That would account for — wait, here 
it is again!” 

The ravaged head shook itself 
together into view on the screens. It 
was more horrid than ever; Pertin’s 
replicate had been in another fight. 
Fresh blood was dribbling down the 
beard-spiked chin. The lower front 
teeth were gone. The hollowed eyes 
were darting frantically from side 
to side as the ruined mouth tried to 
form soundless words. They flashed 
under the banked screens: 

it’s located me again, ugly 

THING. THICK OVAL SLAB, BELTED 
WITH SENSORS, CRAWLING AND 
JUMPING ON A FRINGE OF TEN- 
TACLES. IT DOESN’T COMMUNI- 
CATE, BUT IT HAS JUST ABOUT 
KILLED ME. WE’VE BEEN PLAYING 
HIDE AND SEEK. NOW I THINK IT 
HAS WON THE GAME. SOON IT WILL 
FINISH BREAKING THE DOOR . 

ANYWAY, THAT’S MY REPORT. 
KISS ZARA FOR ME-IF YOU CAN, BEN 
LINC. THAT’S ALL FOR-” 

And there was no more. The 
image exploded and died, and far- 
link underlined it after a moment 
with: 

TRANSMISSION TERMINATED. NO 
FURTHER PULSE FROM SOURCE. 

The belt of screens blazed and 
went blank. 

A stir of strain ran around the 
terminal chamber, and muted 
hootings and clangings and shril- 
lings of communication began. 



THEORG’S EGG 



149 




Ben Line Pertin shook his head 
slowly, trying to take it all in. There 
was so much happening, and so 
fast. Another death of a double. A 
real flesh-and-blood Zara on her 
way. And on the larger scale, the 
fantastic mystery of a scout ship 
from Cuckoo sampling inhabited 
planets. 

He tried to tell Nimmie and 
Venus how he felt. He caught a 
burned-fur scent from Nimmie that 
surprised him, until he recognized 
it. 

Fear. 

The T’Worlie was afraid of what 
the message meant. 

For a moment Ben Line allowed 
himself to share that fear of the 
terrible unknown, of the race that 
must have built that ship. But 
thoughts of Zara came flooding 
back, and his fear melted into an- 
ticipation . 

. and that was how it was with 
Ben Line Pertin on the orbiter. 



W ith Ben Yale Pertin on the 
survey ship, spiraling around 
toward the orbiter, things were 
somewhat different. 

They were better than they had 
been in a long time, he told him- 
self. The survey ship’s medical fa- 
cilities were dealing nicely with the 
blue slime. He spent three days in 
the cocoon while his skin was gently 
soaked away and a new one grown 
on. Then, swathed like a mummy 
in circulating-field bandages, he 



was allowed into the common room 
where the others were gathered — 
his humanoid nurse, a Purchased 
Person, following after him. “I’m 
recovered,” he announced. 

Somewhat warily, his three com- 
panions in the battle against the 
watchers welcomed him. They had 
received medication, too, and look- 
ed fine — especially Zara, thought 
Ben Yale greedily, devouring her 
with his eyes. Redlaw and Org 
Rider gravely shook his head, a 
skill they had recently learned. 
Zara came over and patted his 
head. She drew back and looked at 
him. “Not really, I think,” she 
said. “Not all recovered. But much 
better than when last I saw you.” 
They and the ship crew had been 
excitedly talking over the strange 
message from the orbiter that had 
been relayed to them. While the 
Purchased Person made him com- 
fortable in an open-end hammock, 
Ben Yale listened. “ — explains so 
much,” said the Pmal, speaking for 
a horse-headed Canopan, the ship’s 
pilot. “Explains why some of you 
races are duplicated on Cuckoo. 
That scout ship must have been 
twenty thousand years sailing 
through the galaxy, picking up 
specimens and sending them back. 
And of course some got loose and 
multiplied. They wouldn’t know 
they weren’t indigenous.” 

Org Rider rapped indignantly, 
“That is our home. Our people 
have lived there forever — ” 

The Canopan snickered a 



150 



GALAXY 




whinnying laugh. “No offense,” its 
Pinal said good-naturedly. “But 
what puzzles me,” he went on, “is 
that facsimile of Cuckoo the repli- 
cate found. All made of metal! But 
it isn’t like that, it’s a world. A 
funny one, but still — ” 

“Wait,” cried Org Rider through 
his own translator. “Perhaps I 
know something here! For there is a 
part of our world that is metal. A 
desert, that lies far beyond our 
grass world, beyond the shadow of 
Knife-in-the-Sky. My mother heard 
about it from a chief who owned an 
org. He tried to cross that metal 
desert once, looking for another 
grass world beyond the reach of the 
watchers. He nearly died there.” 
The other beings looked at Org 
Rider, who returned their various 
kinds of gaze steadfastly. 

“It’s true,” he said. “It is all 
bare metal, harder than any axe or 
knife. There’s nothing alive on it. 
No light except the dim glow of the 
clouds. The chief flew until his org 
grew so weak he had to give it all 
the food they carried for both of 
them. And then on the way back, 
trying to return to save their lives, 
he grew weak too, so weak that it 
had to carry him in its trunk. 
And,” he cried, remembering more 
as he spoke, “that is, of course, 
how our world began. Everyone 
knows it! It was a hard bare shell, 
the first org’s egg. Before the 
makers made their great fire to 
hatch all things from it.” 

He paused, puzzled. The beings 



were making a great variety of 
sounds, but the Pmals were not 
translating them into language. 
They could not; the sounds were 
laughter. 

“But it is true,” he insisted. 

Zara smiled and gently put her 
hand in his. “It is puzzling,” she 
said. 

Ben Yale Pertin cleared his 
throat. 

“Zara,” he called. 

It pleased him to see that she 
released the boy’s hand to turn to 
him. 

“Yes, Ben Yale?” 

He hesitated. How to tell her that 
she and he had once been married? 
Indeed were right now married, 
and having children, on Sun One. 
He could not think of the right 
words, and as it was so important 
to him, and he wanted to be able to 
touch her, to kiss her, to hold her in 
his arms when he talked of these 
things, he temporized and turned 
what he said a different way. 

“I’m sorry about — about your 
loss.” He could not bring himself to 
say “about your husband’s death.” 

“Thank you,” she said. “It was a 
shock. But I’ve had a little time to 
get used to it.” 

The Purchased Person suddenly 
spoke, the voice human enough but 
the thought behind it coming from 
heaven knew who, heaven knew 
where. 

“Had you considered you could 
have him again?” it demanded, in 
a voice oddly, harshly male. 



THE ORG’S EGG 



151 




Zara looked surprised, and Red- 
law rumbled, “She said that before 
once, when you weren’t here. Have 
your husband make another copy 
and send it to you — whatever that 
means,” he added, knotting his 
brows and staring about. Redlaw 
had never heard the expression 
“culture shock,” but he was well on 
his way to drowning in it. Org 
Rider seemed to accept everything 
with grave interest and comfortable 
admiration; but he was younger, of 
course. For Redlaw this sudden ex- 
posure to such strangeness was dif- 
ficult. 

Zara said thoughtfully, “Why, 
that never occurred to me.” 

From his cocoon Ben Yale 
uttered a muffled groan. Damn 
that savage, he cursed furiously. 
Giving her that idea — 

She was speaking again: “He 
might very well volunteer for repli- 
cating again, at that. He was — is a 
kind of person, Jon is. But — ” 

She looked around and suddenly 
shook her head, smiling. “I’m sorry 
to be bothering you with my per- 
sonal problems,” she said. 

“No, no,” called Ben Yale, suf- 
fering. “We want to hear. What 
were you going to say?” 

“Well, just that I wouldn’t like to 
ask him to. I know it doesn’t mean 
anything to be transmitted, in real 
terms. You’re not any less for 
having a copy made. But in psycho- 
logical terms it does mean some- 
thing, and you are less. It was hard 
enough on Jon for him to volunteer 



the first time. I wouldn’t want to 
put him through it again.” 

B en yale exulted in the cocoon. 

So Zara would stay free! Of 
course, he mused, that did not 
mean she would marry him. Not 
necessarily. There was always that 
other Ben Pertin, Ben Line, waiting 
hot-handed on the orbiter for them 
to arrive. Ben Yale knew with what 
impatience his double would be 
waiting, and what his intentions 
would be; Ben Yale could not 
mistake them, because he shared 
them wholly and exactly. Well, he 
thought, he had time. The survey 
vessel still had two days to go before 
it reached the orbiter. Of course, 
three days had gone by already — 
days wasted, he complained to him- 
self; but there had been no help for 
it, he had simply been physically 
unable to court Zara. But now — 
now things would be different. He 
closed his eyes, dreaming of how 
they would come to the orbiter. By 
then he would be out of his ban- 
dages and rid of this pestilential 
Purchased Person nurse. He would 
take Zara to dinner — no, he thought 
regretfully, scratch that; there was 
no place on the orbiter for anything 
like that. But he would take her 
aside. In the rec room. At a time 
when not many others would be 
around. 

S he would be grateful to him, 
he estimated complacently; had 
he not saved her life? Or at least 



152 



GALAXY 




helped to do so? And she would 
take the interest in him women al- 
ways take in a hero. And he would 
tell her, gently and simply, about 
his love for her, for Zara Doy; and 
how they had been married, and 
how much they had loved each 
other . 

He scowled. The thought of Ben 
Line Pertin intruded. Ben Line 
would have almost the same advan- 
tages as himself — bar, of course, 
the couple of days before they got 
there. But a couple of days might 
not be long enough to awaken her 
romantic interest. 

He would just have to make it be 
long enough. 

He nodded to himself, sealed up 
the end of the cocoon with a quick 
motion — startling the Purchased 
Person who stood wide-eyed beside 
him — and flipped on the stereo 
stage, putting through a call to Ben 
Line Pertin .on the orbiter. 

When he saw himself, or the Ben 
Line version of himself, he was 
startled. So haggard! So sad! For a 
moment he almost thought it was a 
replay of that terribly depressing 
version of himself from the uniden- 
tified ship; but then Ben Line 
spoke. 

“Oh, it’s you,” he muttered. 
“What do you want?” 

Ben Yale said carefully, “I think 
you know, Ben Line. It’s about 
time we talked — and talked seri- 
ously about Zara.” 

Ben Line nodded lifelessly. 
“Yes. I suppose I should have ex- 



pected you to call. I’m sorry, but — 
well. What can I do? I’ll just go on 
being lonely. I've had plenty of 
practice — as you know.” 

Startled, Ben Yale stared at his 
duplicate. Elation and a nagging, 
suspicious fear fought with each 
other in his mind; he struggled to 
keep his voice level, even as he was 
wondering what had made Ben 
Line give up so easily. “I admire 
you for taking it so well,” he 
managed to say. 

“You do?” Ben Line looked sur- 
prised. Then, slowly, “Well, I kind 
of admire you, too. I mean, you 
actually look content, and God 
knows I can’t; I don’t feel it. Well, 
it’s too bad we both had to be 
losers, but maybe it would be even 
harder if we weren’t.” And without 
another word he broke the connec- 
tion. 

Losers? 

Ben Yale shook his swathed 
head, unbelievingly. Both of them 
losers? 

And then a sudden fear chilled 
him, and he opened the end of the 
cocoon once more and peered out 
at Zara — 

At Zara and Org Rider, sitting 
quietly, whispering to each other, 
the boy’s one hand caught in the 
girl’s two, their shoulders touch- 
ing. 

Losers. 

The days of passage had been 
enough in which to awaken her ro- 
mantic interest after all. 

But not in him. ★

tropics between served as their planet. She could see nothing of it, 
battleground. even with her amplisight blinked 

And a battle was in progress as on, from where she hesitated fifty 
Gweanvin Oster approached the thousand miles out. The barbs had 



155 





evidently agreed to limit their com- 
bat zone to the ground and atmos- 
phere — perhaps because space- 
flights were too deadly even for 
them. 

What Gweanvin could not see, 
however, she could hear quite dis- 
tinctly over the comm implant in 
her left ear. Cryptic commands and 
responses were snapping like verbal 
firecrackers among the Primgran- 
ese forces, along with savage yells 
of glee and occasional grunts of dis- 
may. She had no trouble recogniz- 
ing the deep bark of Spart Dargow, 
general of the Primgranese barbs, 
as he bellowed his orders. 

Using her psionic comm tuner, 
Gweanvin scanned the band and 
found the frequency being used by 
the Lontastan forces. All she could 
get was a meaningless garble, since 
her unscrambler could not handle 
the Lontastan code. She listened 
only a moment before tuning back 
to General Dargow. 

. Red-seven, red-seven, horse- 
back dawn, horseback dawn! . 
Jato. blue-forty, jato, damn it! . 
Red-ten, red-ten, washout, wash- 
out!" 

As a frontliner herself, Gweanvin 
had worked with Guardsmen 
enough to be familiar with their 
command language. But she could 
make only limited sense out of what 
she was hearing. Dargow was using 
a couple of terms she had never 
heard before, such as “horseback 
dawn.” And she wasn’t sure such 
familiar commands as "jato’.’ meant 



the same thing here on Jopat as 
back home. 

Here, after all, the language was 
being used in a situation that had 
never existed before— a pitched 
battle between massed forces of 
Guardsmen. In the econo-w'ar, 
Guardsmen guarded. They defend- 
ed their worlds, whether in the 
Primgranese Commonality or the 
Lontastan Federation, against entry 
by such enemy frontliners as spies, 
saboteurs and subverters. Oc- 
casionally a squad would vector out 
a few light-years to the assistance of 
a returning and hotly pursued 
frontliner, and a brief running 
battle would ensue. But never any- 
thing so insane as this combat on a 
wildworld. 

Gweanvin grimaced in disgust. 
What boneheads these genetic bar- 
barians were! Very useful in keep- 
ing the econo-war honest, very 
competitive, very high-survival— 
but boneheads! 

She went full inert and let her 
momentum carry her slowly down- 
ward, her velocity of perhaps ten 
thousand miles per hour relative to 
the planet. Except for being hungry 
after five days in space, she had no 
reason to hurry. Could be that it 
might be best to let the battle end 
before she tried to land. She had 
now located the scene of conflict as 
the late-afternoon zone, and she 
guessed hostilities would end by the 
time night fell if not before. 

A Lontastan voice, speaking un- 
coded, suddenly boomed at her: 



156 



GALAXY 




"Hev. you. at forty-seven thousand 
altitude! Identify yourself!” 

Gweanvin’s zerburst pistol was in 
her right hand instantly and her de- 
tector implants out full. She had 
trouble spotting her challengers, 
with the mass of the planet behind 
them and they only a few thousand 
miles up. There appeared to be 
about twenty of them, hanging 
south of the battle area, probably 
as rear guards and observers. 

She tongued her toothmike and 
replied: "I’m Gweanvin Oster of 
the Commonality. Don’t let me in- 
terrupt your stupid game. I’ll wait 
here till it’s over.” 

“Like hell you will!” boomed the 
response. " You got no business up 
there! You're south of the equator! 
Haul it north, doxie, or we'll blow 
you north!” 

“Just try it, foghead!” she snarl- 
ed back, and went on with a sug- 
gestion that the Lontastan go 
amuse himself in a manner both 
vulgar and physically impossible. 



T he twenty vague specks vanish- 
ed abruptly. Gweanvin held her 
position a precise two-fifths of a 
second, then warped away on a 
minivector of some five thousand 
miles eastward. At that, she moved 
a trifle too soon to sucker the entire 
squad. Only six zerburst lances 
were fired, to terminate into flares 
of supersolar energy around the 
spot she had vacated. Gweanvin 
fired two quick shots of her own at 



the sourcepoints of two lances and 
vectored away quickly without wait- 
ing to see the results. 

“ Gweanvin Osier, what the hell 
are you doing?” General Dargow’s 
voice was blasting at her. He 
sounded angry and concerned. 
“ Vector north, girl!” 

“Stay out of this, General Bone- 
head,” she snapped, making an- 
other miniwarp when she found 
herself without a clear target. 

“ You're breaking our rules!” he 
protested furiously. 

Her new breakout point put her 
close enough to one Lontastan for 
her to drill him cleanly through the 
belly. Her lance flared late, how- 
ever, a hundred miles on the other 
side of him. Still, he would be one 
sick barb for a couple of weeks. “So 
what?” she snorted as she fired. 

“So we'll come help the Lonnies 
blast you, if you keep fooling 
around!” yelled Dargow. “ You'll 
still be gas when the universe 
coalesces!” 

Her new minivector carried 
Gweanvin straight down, as close 
as she could warp toward the at- 
mosphere without traumatizing 
herself. Here she had a few seconds 
respite from detection. “Send men 
you don’t want!” she retorted warn- 
ingly. As soon as she had the Lon- 
tastans above her well located, she 
miniwarped into their midst. This 
time she stayed long enough to get 
off three shots before making an- 
other quick drop out of normspace. 
She had an advantage in that she 



LITTLE GAME 



157 




could shoot at any target she de- 
tected, whereas the Lontastans 
needed an extra split-second to 
make sure an unwarping figure was 
not one of their comrades. 

She grinned. Playing a lone hand 
had its good points. 

Dargow’s voice was still yelling in 
her ear, threatening to send Prim- 
granese fighters out to help the 
Lonnies blast her. But she made no 
response. Dargow was smart 
enough to know that mixing a 
squad of Grannies with the Lonnies 
would only add to the confusion al- 
ready working for her, so his threat 
could be considered idle. She con- 
centrated on her deadly game. 

A few seconds later she noted 
that Dargow’s yells were no longer 
directed at her but at some Lon- 
tastan commander. “Pull your men 
back!" he was urging. " Ignore her! 
She’s just an interloper from back 
home, not working with me!” 

T he general’s new tack suddenly 
worked. The space around 
Gweanvin emptied as the Lonnie 
squad warped away. 

She blinked and looked around. 
Far below three bodies were tumb- 
ling planetward. Two other squad- 
men, evidently wounded and with 
damaged transport implants, were 
going down in controlled inert 
mode. That made a Lonnie casualty 
list of six, she figured, because she 
was sure she had flared one into 
vapor. 



Below, the barb battle had end- 
ed, too, evidently broken off short 
because of the distraction she had 
created. She could hear a bedlam 
of pull-back commands over her 
comm as she vectored northward 
and began descending toward 
Primgranese territory. 

“Gweanvin Oster, what the hell 
are you up to?" Dargow snarled. 

“Coming in for a landing,” she 
replied nonchalantly. “Give me a 
location.” 

“You know what I mean, ” he 
stormed. 

“Yes, I know. I also know I’m 
not playing your damn-fool game 
so I don’t have to abide by its silly 
rules. I wasn’t bothering the Lon- 
nies, until they came up and started 
shooting. Are you going to give me 
a location?” 

“No! I'm telling you to warp for 
home right now. ” 

“Nuts to that. I’ve been in space 
five days and I’m starving. Wel- 
come or not, I’m coming down to 
eat.” 

“Okay, damn it! Somebody will 
meet you at forty-one north, four 
forty-five realtime solar. But to- 
morrow you head for home, girl. ” 

“That’s tomorrow’s problem,” 
she replied.

as she hit the fringe of Jopat’s at-

her body from air friction. At the 
same time the screen bulged out to 
act as braking wings. A few minutes 
later her breathing went exterior. 
After five days with nothing to do, 
her nose sniffed the fresh smell of 
Jopat’s air with appreciation. 

She holstered her gun as she ap- 
proached the location the general 
had given her. There she detected 
only one barb waiting for her, 
hovering at five thousand feet. She 
swooped to a halt six feet in front of 
him and saw that it was Nathel 
Gromon. 

He grinned at her. “Well, well, 
Skinny Hips.” He chuckled. “Come 
all this way because you can’t live 
without me. Right?” 

“Meatheads aren’t my type,” she 
retorted. 

He chuckled some more. “And 
you’re not old Spart Dargow’s type, 
chicken. He’s mad enough to skin 
you.” 

“This conversation reminds me 
of how hungry I am, for some rea- 
son,” she said. 

“Okay. Follow me down.” 

The barb dropped groundward, 
leveled off sharply just above the 
treetops and headed westward. 
Gweanvin trailed him closely. 

“One thing puzzles me about 
you, Nathel,” she said. 

“What’s that?” 

“Most of you idiots came to 
Jopat because of econo-war back 
home was fizzling, and out here you 
and the Lonnies could have a little 
war of your own. That made a 



primitive kind of sense under the 
circumstances. There was nothing 
for genetic barbarians to do at 
home, and nobody seemed to know 
how to get the econo-war heated up 
again. 1 even dropped out myself 
for a couple of years ...” 

“I remember.” 

“But you stuck out the doldrums 
at home, Nathel. You didn’t leave 
until three months ago. That was 
after our Bauble telepathic com- 
municators had been developed to 
put the Commonality back on even 
terms with the Lontastans and their 
telepath, Monte. The econo-war 
was coming to life again. Guards- 
men were needed — especially for 
planets where Baubles were being 
installed. There was the prospect of 
plenty of action for you. And that 
was precisely when you pulled out. 
Why?” 

Nathel Gromon grimaced. “You 
said the dirty word. Bauble.” 
“What does the Bauble have to 
do with it?” 

“It opened my eyes,” he grunted. 
“It showed me how other people 
really think of us barbs.” 

“How do they think?” 

“Oh . that we’re stupid.” 
“Hell, did you need telepathy to 
find that out?” She snorted. “I’ve 
called you stupid a hundred times! 
Did you think I was kidding?” 
Gromon frowned uncomfortably. 
“It’s not the same thing. You and 
me mentacommed once, if you re- 
call, after they got the Bauble on 
Prima Gran.” 



LITTLE GAME

Gweanvin nodded. “How could I 
forget?” 

“Well, the way you thought 
about me was okay. You think kind 
of hard and snotty about every- 
body, did you know that? But all 
them pencil-pushers . it’s like 
I’m some kind of animal, the way 
they look at it.” 

“Aw-w-w,” Gweanvin cooed 
mockingly. “Did the mean old 
pencil-pushers hurt Nathel’s tender 
little feelings?” 

“Go to hell,” the big man 
grunted. “It’s just that who needs 
it! The econo-war is a pencil- 
pusher’s war. It fits them, not us. 
Hell, they outnumber us a million 
to one. It has to be their kind of 
fight. So I say, let them have it their 
way, and we’ll stay on Jopat and 
have ours our way.” 

Gweanvin shrugged. “Prima 
Gran sent twenty doctrinists out 
here a few weeks ago. They were 
supposed to try to reason with you 
lunkheads. If they couldn’t talk you 
out of such fallacious attitudes as 
that, far be it from me to even try.” 
After a moment, she added, “All 
those doctrinists suddenly went 
out-comm. What happened to 
them?” 

Gromon grinned. “Oh, we listen- 
ed to them, till they started repeat- 
ing themselves. That got too bor- 
ing, so we field-stripped them and 
grounded them — on a semi-tropic 
island. They’re safe enough. The 
insects here don’t like the taste of 
humans much, and we parlayed 



with the Lonnies to keep the fight- 
ing away from that island.” 

G weanvin was not especially 
fond of doctrinists but she 
failed to share Gromon’s amuse- 
ment. Field-stripping a man was as 
ugly a crime as horse-thievery had 
been on an earlier frontier, and for 
the same reason. A man lived and 
moved by the life-support devices 
implanted in his body: power pack- 
ets, shieldscreen generators, inertia 
nullifiers, propulsors, communica- 
tors and so on. To field-strip him — 
to cut out those devices that could 
be removed by simple operations — 
was the dirtiest of dirty tricks. In 
the econo-war not even captured 
frontliners were subjected to such 
treatment. 

But Gweanvin saw no point to 
making an issue of the transgres- 
sion. She could guess that the barbs 
had made it to put everybody on 
notice that on Jopat the game was 
played by barb rules, and outsiders 
had better not try to interfere. 

“Getting back to the way pencil- 
pushers think of barbs,” she said, 
“that’s something the doctrinists, 
being pencil-pushers themselves, 
could hardly explain to you. They 
take that attitude toward all front- 
liners — toward me the same as 
toward you idiots. And it boils 
down to the fact that they just don’t 
dig killing or being killed. They 
can’t play, or even appreciate, a 
game played on that level.” 

“They’re narrow,” growled Gro- 



160 



GALAXY 




mon. “Killing is just bodies. If I get 
killed, all I got to do is find me a 
new one. And that ain’t hard, be- 
cause babies are being born every 
second.” 

“Right,” Gweanvin agreed. 
“You know, all through history the 
most atheistic societies, the ones 
that didn’t believe in the survival of 
the ego-field, were the most 
squeamish about killing.” 

“But that don’t hold any more,” 
objected the barb. “People don’t 
have ignorance as an excuse now.” 

“No, but they have other rea- 
sons. Killing is destructive, waste- 
ful — and the whole point of the 
econo-war is to have hard competi- 
tion that is essentially constructive. 
It can’t be all one way, true. But 
the vast majority of participants, 
the pencil-pushers, have to view 
conflict as a motivator for non-de- 
structive activities.” 

Gromon grunted noncommit- 
tally. 

“Also,” Gweanvin went on, “kil- 
ling and being killed are both trau- 
matic. They were basic to the 
anatomy of unsanity. Pysch-releas- 
ing removed that problem quite a 
few centuries ago, of course, but 
the old association with unsanity 
gives killing an ugliness that’s still 
remembered.” 

“Well, I can see all that,” Gro- 
mon conceded, “but you ain’t talk- 
ing me into going back, girl. I like 
it here.” 

“Hell,” Gweanvin grunted, “if 
twenty glib doctrinists couldn’t talk 



some sense through your thick 
skulls, I’m not going to try. Propa- 
gandizing^ not my line.” 

Gromon turned his head toward 
her briefly to study her emo- 
pattern. “Old Dargow figures 
Prima Gran sent you out here to 
bring us home,” he said. “Do you 
say different?” 

“No. That’s what I’m here for.” 

“Well, how can you do it, if you 
don’t talk us into it?” he de- 
manded. “You can’t force us to go 
back.” 

“I’ll be damned if I know, 
Nathel,” she replied, flashing an- 
noyed frustration. “I’m flying blind 
on this stupid mission, and that’s 
the disgusting truth.” 

Gromon considered this informa- 
tion with surprise for several 
seconds before chuckling. “I guess 
we really got the high brass running 
in circles back at Prima Gran HQ,” 
he said smugly. 

“Maybe so,” murmured Gwean- 
vin. 

She had puzzled over the ques- 
tion for hours during her flight to 
Jopat, and it still made no sense to 
her. This mission wasn’t spying. It 
wasn’t sabotage. And if it was sub- 
version, it was not the kind she was 
accustomed to. So, being none of 
those three, the mission simply 
wasn't in her line of work. 

And in the past, even when 
engaged in work that was her line, 
Gweanvin had always gone out with 
detailed and specific orders — with 
a plan to put into operation. But 



LITTLE GAME 



161 




this time all she had been told by 
the Special Assignments Bureau 
was to go to Jopat and bring the 
Primgranese Guardsmen home. 

Gromon had been watching her 
emo as she glummed over her prob- 
lem, and was radiating glee. “This 
is going to hand everybody here a 
hell of a big laugh,” he chortled. “I 
can’t wait to see old Dargow’s face 
when I tell him! But slow down. 
We’re on top of my camp.” 

Gweanvin followed him as he 
eased down among the tall trees to 
come to ground in a widely dis- 
persed and rustic-looking campsite. 
A well-endowed young woman with 
dark hair was watching them from 
beside a stone fireplace, on which a 
crude earthware pot of stew sim- 
mered. It sent out odors fit to drive 
Gweanvin mad. 

"Gweanvin, meet Valla,” Gro- 
mon muttered, a touch of embar- 
rassment showing. Gweanvin knew 
Gromon’s wife, a barb named 
Samis, who had refused to come to 
Jopat with her husband. Guards- 
men seldom had difficulty getting 
women, however, barb or other- 
wise. Gweanvin was not surprised 
to find a young beauty presiding 
over Gromon’s cookfire. 

Valla’s emo-pattern showed dis- 
like and misgiving for a moment as 
she studied Gweanvin’s slim, al- 
most boyish figure. Then, evidently 
deciding that such a wispy though 
pretty girl was no real competi- 
tion, she smiled. Half-regretfully, 
Gweanvin decided not to disabuse 



her on that score. On a wilderness 
world like Jopat it would be foolish 
to get on bad terms with a talented 
cook, while available men were 
more than plentiful. 

“That stew smells wonderful, 
Valla,” she cooed. 

B efore Gweanvin had more than 
started eating, numerous barbs 
began dropping by that part of the 
camp. Some were old friends of 
hers desiring to renew acquaint- 
anceship; most were strangers eager 
for a close look at the doll-faced 
little dish of dynamite whose skir- 
mish with a whole squad of Lonnies 
had tizzied the top brass of both 
sides. Gromon, meanwhile, drifted 
away, presumably to report to 
General Dargow. 

Gweanvin enjoyed the evening — 
being the center of attention was 
always fun. At least ten of the 
younger awol Guardsmen, either 
unattached to women or lightly at- 
tached, courted her unsuccessfully. 
Not that she didn’t regard sex as 
fun. It was just that she would not 
want the barbs to think of her as a 
camp-follower and, with her thus 
classified to their satisfaction, dis- 
miss her from their curiosity. To 
accomplish anything at all toward 
the completion of her mission, she 
felt, she would need to keep the 
barbs attentive — and if possible, 
mystified. 

The cookfire was finally per- 
mitted to die down and the last of 
the visitors departed. Gormon had 



162 



GALAXY 




returned, but Valla had already 
discreetly lured him away to safety, 
evidently suspecting from the male 
attention Gweanvin was getting 
that she had underestimated the 
Prima Gran girl as potential com- 
petition. 

Gweanvin chuckled to herself. 
Women were bigger idiots than 
barbs sometimes. That chick Valla, 
trying to own Nathel Gromon, who 
was certain to drift back to his wife 
sooner or later. If he didn’t get 
vaporized first, of course. 

She yawned, went semi-inert, 
and kicked herself up into a se- 
cluded treetop. There she hooked a 
beltsnap around a limb as a tether, 
and relaxed. After a moment she 
activated her tightbeam comm, 
tongued her toothmike, and said 
softly: 

“GO to HQ SA-Forty. Smit- 
wak?” 

"I'm here, Gweanvin, ” came the 
response from distant Prima Gran. 
"Report. " 

“I’m on Jopat, in contact with 
our barbs,’’ she said. “Nothing new 
here since the last time you heard 
from the doctrinists. They’re alive, 
by the way — field-stripped and iso- 
lated.” 

There was a pause on the other 
end. Gweanvin giggled as she 
imagined the angry thoughts that 
must be passing through the Prima 
Gran Bauble. 

Smitwak spoke again. “ Get us 
the precise location of the doc- 
trinists, " he snapped. "We've got

enough loyal barbs to send out a 
heavily armed rescue party. " 

“Cool down, Smitty,” she re- 
plied. “I can dicker the barbs into 
letting you rescue them without a 
fight. These knuckleheads wanted 
to show how ornery they could be if 
anybody tried to interfere with 
them. They’ve made their point, 
and I think that now they’ll let the 
doctrinists go.” 

“Okay, work on that. Mean- 
while, the rescue team will be on its 
wav. Now, any progress with your 
mission?" 

“What the hell do you think?” 
she snarled. “I don’t even know 
how to begin. Don’t you have 
further instructions?” 

"No. Continue under your origi- 
nal orders, Gweanvin." 

“Those damned orders don’t tell 
me a thing!” 

“Sorry. You're on the scene. 
Gweanvin, in a position to evaluate 
the situation more thoroughly than 
HQ can and devise a practical plan 
to pursue. Give yourself time to 
think it through . not too much 
time, however. The need for those 
experienced Guardsmen is getting 
urgent here . " 

“Take my time, but hurry, huh?” 
she grunted disdainfully. “Thanks 
a lot. I’ll set your words to music 
and sing myself to sleep with them. 
Out.” 

"Stay in touch, Gweanvin. Love 
and out." 

A light rain had started falling.

T he general wanted to see her the 
next morning. 

He was waiting outside when 
Gromon brought her to Battle 
Headquarters, the only solid build- 
ing Gweanvin was to see on Jopat. 
Constructed of meltstone, it had 
feet-thick walls and roof that were 
obviously flareproof. 

Gromon and a few other staff 
officers stood around grinning as 
Spart Dargow glared disapproval at 
the slim shorts-and-haltered figure. 
Gweanvin glared back with cool 
disdain. Dargow was a seven- 
footer, several inches taller than the 
barb average, a middle-aged man 
of perhaps sixty-five whose hair and 
beard were grayshot. 

“You look the same as when I 
last saw you, and that was a good 
seven years back,” he growled. 
“When are you going to become a 
woman?” 

She made a gesture of indiffer- 
ence. She was well aware of the 
striking contrast between herself 
and the normal woman of thirty- 
four E-years. But she had never 
found the contrast disturbing. 
“Who knows?” she said. “Maybe 
never, like some boneheads I know 
whose brains never develop.” 

His reaction to the verbal jab was 
minimal. “I recall somebody de- 
scribing you,” he said, “as fifty-five 



164

pounds of brass and fifty-five 
pounds of viper venom. I see that 
hasn’t changed, either.” 

“Right. I still weigh one hundred 
and ten,” she replied. 

Dargow’s frown deepened, and 
his emo slowly shifted from dis- 
approval to curiosity. Gweanvin 
knew what he was trying to do — 
understand her well enough to 
categorize her, and thus discover 
how to deal with her. 

“I keep thinking,” he finally 
muttered, “that you must be the 
victim of an incompetent psych- 
release, but that doesn't hold up. 
And I never heard of a physical 
deficiency the docs can’t handle. 
Just what the hell is it with you, 
girl?” 

Ask a polite question and get a 
polite answer, thought Gweanvin. 
“The physiologists tell me I’m a 
mutant, with a characteristic of late 
physical maturity.” 

‘‘Oh . any more like you 
around?” 

“1 don’t know of any yet.” 

“And I guess you won’t ever,” he 
grumbled. ‘‘That’s a damn-fool 
mutation if I ever heard of one. 
Late maturity gives you too many 
chances to get killed before you 
breed. Especially if you go around 
frontlining like a wild morimet or 
something! Now, we genetic bar- 
barians breed early — ” 

“And often,” Gweanvin inserted. 
“We’re high-survival,” he went 
on, “but unless you get your skinny 
rump home, and settle down be- 



hind a nice safe pencil till you’re 
ready to have kids, your genetic line 
is going to be awful short.” 

Gweanvin shrugged. “Crap,” she 
sniffed. 

“Good sense,” the general re- 
torted angrily. 

“Where’s the good sense of try- 
ing to perpetuate a strain so low- 
survival that it needs that kind of 
protecting?” she countered. “If I 
don’t have enough survival abilities 
to do the things I want to do, and 
still stay alive to have babies some 
day, to hell with my genetic line.” 
Dargow snorted. “You think you 
got those survival abilities?” 

“I think I’ll be around to spit in 
your vapor, general.” 

‘‘Lots of luck!” he snapped. 
“Now, what’s this about you trying 
to talk us into returning to the 
Commonality?” 

“I’m not. The doctrinists used 
every conceivable argument to try 
to get some reason through your 
thick skulls, and they failed. So I’m 
not trying to talk anybody into any- 
thing.” 

“You are here to get us to go 
back, though.” 

“Right.” 

“And you don’t know how you’ll 
go about it?” 

“Right again.” 

Dargow grunted an obscenity. 
“Maybe I ought to find that funny, 
but I don’t like it a damned bit.” 
Gweanvin’s eyes widened. This 
was a favorable development she 
had not anticipated. Plainly, Dar-

gow could not counter her play if he 
did not know her game. And he 
could not force her to tell it, be- 
cause she did not know it herself. 

“I’ve changed my mind about 
making you leave Jopat this morn- 
ing,” he said after a pause. “The 
more convinced the pencil-pushers 
become that we’re here to stay, de- 
spite any tricks they try to pull, the 
better for everybody. If I made you 
leave, they’d think you had us wor- 
ried, unsure of ourselves. So stick 
around as long as you like — but try 
to stay out from underfoot.” 

“Thanks, general,” she replied. 
“Since I’m at loose ends right now, 
as far as my mission is concerned, I 
may as well participate in this little 
game you and the Lonnie barbs are 
playing. I’m not much on team- 
work, since I usually operate alone, 
but — ” 

“You want to fight the Lonnies?” 
gasped the general. 

“Why not?” she demanded. 
“They’re the enemies of Prima 
Gran, aren’t they? They would kill 
me if they could. Besides, I don’t 
relish spending my time gossiping 
with your camp followers. And if 
I’m in the fight, maybe I can cut 
the number of you boneheads who 
get killed before I figure out how to 
make you come home. How about 
it?” 

“You’re on! Gromon, Green-Ten 
has lost a couple of snipers lately. 
Take this recruit over to Green 
Camp and tell Dak Surants she’s 
his new man.” 



T wo days later Gweanvin was ap- 
proaching her first battle sta- 
tion, on or nearly on Jopat’s 
equator. The jungle was slightly 
less dense than a typical rain-forest 
because Jopat has fifteen percent 
less than typical E-world moisture. 
And as she flitted through the tree 
trunks and hanging vines on semi- 
inert, Gweanvin passed through 
several flare-burned clearings in 
various stages of regrowth, evidence 
that there had been plenty of shoot- 
ing in the area although it was not a 
favorite battle zone. 

A mile and a half short of her 
assigned spot, she dropped to the 
ground, went inert, and reported 
in. 

“Rocket to Axe.” 

“Axe here, Rocket, ” responded 
Dak Surants’ voice. 

“Rocket in place,” she reported. 
“Oke and out. " 

She had wondered if Surants 
would challenge her “in place’’ 
claim when she was obviously short 
of her assigned position. He had 
not, but probably he would raise 
hell about it later. 

But Gweanvin had worked under 
cover entirely too much to start 
taking damn-fool risks in the man- 
ner of the careless and rather lazy 
barbs. She had no intention of do- 
ing a semi-inert flit all the way to 
her post. Functioning transport im- 
plants, with their high power-drain, 
were too easily detected. She meant 
to walk the rest of the way with 
power packs at minimal output. 



166 



GALAXY 




And walk it she did, in less than 
thirty minutes, using no life-sup- 
port other than a tight shieldscreen 
to ward off the brambles she shoved 
through and to provide necessary 
air-conditioning against the heat. 
On enemy detectors she would be 
little more noticeable than a large 
native animal stomping through 
the undergrowth. 

When she reached her assigned 
spot she climbed into the highest, 
sturdiest tree she could locate — still 
moving under muscle-power alone 
— and found a concealed perch. 
Then she settled down to wait for 
action. 

She drew her zerburst pistol and 
studied its settings thoughtfully. 

The gun was basically a laser 
projector, the characteristics of its 
lance and flare governed principally 
by the intensity of the beam. At 
lowest'intensity it produced a lance 
which never flared — merely a bolt 
of monochromatic light. That bolt 
would punch through the hardest 
shieldscreen as if it were not there 
and drill deeply into whatever flesh, 
stone or metal it struck. 

But above a certain intensity 
threshold, so high that the light- 
energy took on aspects of mass, 
relativistic effects came into play. 
The front end of the lance propa- 
gated at normal light-velocity for 
the medium through which it was 
traveling. Because its concentration 
was such as to make it behave like 
mass, however, it underwent space- 
time contraction, this effect in- 



creasing in magnitude from the 
front end of the lance to the rear. 

The net result was that the rear 
portions of the lance propagated 
progressively faster than the speed 
of light. That caused the lance to 
telescope in upon itself until, at 
flarepoint, its length came so close 
to zero, and its raving energy so 
closely confined, as to constitute a 
time-space “singularity” — an un- 
sustainable state. So it flared, re- 
leasing nearly all the energy of the 
entire lance at one point and in one 
tiny fraction of a nanosecond. 

The higher the intensity of laser 
beam fired, the more quickly it 
would flare. Maximum practical 
flare range was about two million 
miles — a very weak flare — and 
minimum was a mile and a quarter. 
At that short range the gunner ran 
a real risk of getting a bad case of 
sunburn from his own flare. 

All in all, the zerburst pistol was 
an excellent weapon for Guards- 
men, operating in space but in the 
near vicinity of their planet. But for 
ground -fighting or aerial combat? 
“Lousy,” Gweanvin muttered to 
herself. 

She realized she could not argue 
with her weapon, even though she 
could think of three other types of 
handguns she had used in the past 
that would be preferable in her 
present situation. The point was 
that the zerburst gun was the 
weapon of the Guardsmen. It was 
their baby. And of course they 
would not consider using anything 



LITTLE GAME 



167 




else in their private little war on 
Jopat. 

She turned the beam down to 
low, non-flaring intensity, with 
maximum-duration lance. She 
could change it back quickly if she 
spotted Lonnies stupid enough to 
be bunched so that a flare could 
catch several. Otherwise, she would 
rely on the accuracy of her aim to 
drill — maybe slash — any singletons 
she spotted. 

Jopat’s sun climbed higher in the 
sky. And higher. It was overhead. 
It crept lower. And lower. 

A helluva lousy way to play a 
game, fumed Gweanvin. It dawned 
on her that there might not be any 
action at all in her sector that day. 
Or the following day. 

But she had agreed to play by the 
barbs’ rules. That meant she did 
not desert her post, no matter how 
little action came her way. 

It was midafternoon before she 
heard Dak Surants snap: “Motor 
through Target, ho the fox!" 

That meant someone had spotted 
enemy elements approaching the 
line on which she was posted. Prob- 
ably forward scouts on anti-sniper 
patrol, she guessed. Such deploy- 
ment was a standard opening move, 
according to what she had been 
told. 

She killed her shieldscreen and 
gasped when the sullen heat of the 
jungle, no longer held at bay, hit 
her like a blow. But detectable 
power usage was now down to the 
barely perceptible trickle required 



for sense amplification and emo- 
monitoring. Until she used her 
gun, an enemy would have to look 
at her to know she was there. 

Minutes later she detected a 
Lonnie advancing on a line that 
would take him through the trees a 
thousand yards to her left. 

The incautious speed of his ad- 
vance indicated that he was not 
really expecting opposition here. 
Gweanvin guessed that, as she had 
hoped, Lonnie observers had pin- 
pointed her at the spot a mile and a 
half north where she had made her 
last comm transmission and switch- 
ed off her transport implants. The 
passing Lonnie seemed to be mak- 
ing for that spot. 

She let him go by. 

Less than a minute later three 
more Lonnies came into detection, 
well spread out, following the lead 
man. None would pass- within feet 
of her, so as to actually be visible 
through the curtains of foliage. But 
all would pass within reasonable 
range for detection-aiming. 

They arrived abreast of her. She 
blazed away with the zerburst gun, 
first to the left, where two of the 
barbs were passing, then to the 
right, her lances of light stoom- 
stoo/wing through the air and vege- 
tation in tight patterns that riddled 
the vague detection images of the 
enemy barbs. 

Without pause, she flicked into 
semi-inert mode just long enough 
to streak down from her perch. 
Before touching ground she had 



168 



GALAXY 




returned her comm to the frequency 
Lonnie patrols were using. She 
caught the garbled but identical re- 
ports made by two of the downed 
men. From the third came only 
silence. Conclusion: two wounded, 
one dead. 

She was running northward. Her 
perch would no longer be tenable, 
of course. For several seconds, 
vapor trails marking the passage of 
her zerburst lances would hang 
whitely in the air, pointing telltale 
fingers back to their source point 
for any aerial observer to see — and 
as soon as the nearest wounded 
Lonnie could move himself to a safe 
distance, that tree would be the 
target for a Lonnie flare. 

And that lead Lonnie — the one 
supposed to have drawn her fire — 
was up ahead somewhere. She 
didn’t like the idea of leaving him 
to her north while she was looking 
for action from the south. He just 
might try to sneak back on her . 

He did. Almost, but not quite, as 
cautious as she, he was coming 
through the concealing ground 
growth toward her, his transport 
implants off. But his shieldscreen 
was on, while Gweanvin was suffer- 
ing unprotected the stings, 
scratches and heat of her jungle 
run. 

She halted when she detected 
him, aimed her gun, and stood 
puffing while she waited for him to 
emerge into visual contact. When 
he did . 

“Hi!” she chirped. He had an in- 



stant in which to view her grin be- 
fore she lanced him through the 
brain. 

Immediately she activated her 
shieldscreen, and with only seconds 
to spare before the expected flare 
erupted back at her vigil tree. The 
airblast bounced her around for a 
moment. 

“Axe to Rocket, report. ” Su- 
rants’ voice demanded. 

She was up and flitting hurriedly 
toward the spot of the flare, taking 
advantage of the detection- 
jamming miasma of ionization from 
induced radioactivity that would 
hang over the spot for several 
seconds. 

She tongued her toothmike. 
“Two Lonnies killed, two wounded. 
Out.” 

" You're drawing the crowd. 
Out. ” replied Surants. 

Which meant that the ruckus she 
had stirred up was going to make 
her the focus of the coming battle. 
That was often the way the barb 
battles developed — each side pour- 
ing forces into the scene of the 
hottest action. 

The Lonnies would be eager to 
blast the Granny sniper who had so 
quickly disposed of an entire anti- 
sniper patrol. 

She dived into the small crater 
now marking the site of the tree in 
which she had perched, and went 
full inert. The backwind had litter- 
ed the ground with smoldering em- 
bers so she had to keep up her 
shieldscreen. Tumbling to the 



LITTLE GAME 



169 




deepest, most sheltered position the 
hole offered, she halted in a crouch, 
peering up through the drifting 
smoke with zerburst gun held 
ready. She had switched it to flare 
intensity, range tentatively set at a 
mile and a half. 

Ten seconds, fifteen seconds . 

Lances appeared, three of them 
simultaneously, foreshortened be- 
cause they were aimed close to her 
position. Gweanvin upped her 
gun’s range to three miles and fired 
back at the source of one lance 
before glare and flying debris and 
hard gusts of superheated air made 
aiming impossible. Her crater was 
now the center of a pattern of four 
craters — then of six, then of eight, 
as two of the aerial gunners fired 
again and again. 

Rocks and dust, tree trunks and 
splinters — chunks of debris of all 
shapes and sizes — were raining 
down on her. Impatiently she main- 
tained her crouch, protected by the 
shieldscreen, and waited for the 
worst of the deluge to end so she 
could jump over to one of the newer 
and therefore safer holes. 

But when the stuff stopped 
falling, she was completely buried 
in it ... a good fifteen feet deep! 
Her hole was now a mound 
slammed together by the pattern of 
surrounding blasts, and she was 
under it. She cursed. 

Not that she couldn’t get out. 
That would be easy enough. But in 
so doing she would use so much 
power as to draw the fire of every 



Lonnie within range. She was effec- 
tively immobilized. 

And outside the battle was 
getting hot. She could detect it 
fuzzily through the junk piled on 
top of her. 

"Axe to Rocket!" came the con- 
cerned voice of Surants. 

“Oh, shut up,” she said crossly, 
then hit him with a string of utterly 
blue vulgarities, making clear her 
total disdain for this simple-minded 
and primitively pointless little war 
game. 

"Glad you're in one' piece. Roc- 
ket. ” he responded lamely. 

“Go take a barbed-wire enema, 
you anachronism. Out!” She settled 
down to wait out the battle, mind- 
ful that the wait might end any in- 
stant if a stray flare caught her 
mound, but not fretting about the 
possibility. 

IV 

I t was three hours after sunset 
before all was quiet above. From 
comm talk she had listened in on, 
Gweanvin gathered the Grannies 
were claiming an overwhelming vic- 
tory, which was not surprising. 
Thanks to the rules under which 
they fought, the Lonnies and Gran- 
nies were usually so evenly matched 
in combat that any unanticipated 
success or failure could set a trend 
that would hold throughout a 
battle. And Gweanvin’s victory at 
the very outset, from which she had 
emerged vitriolically alive though 



170 



GALAXY 




discomfited, was more than enough 
to carry the day. 

She was mildly pleased by this. 
As she had told General Dargow, a 
main reason she wanted to get into 
the war was to keep as many Prim- 
granese Guardsmen as possible 
alive to return to duty in the Com- 
manality. If that entailed killing 
Lonnies before they could kill her 
Grannies, so be it. 

The annoying thing was that she 
still had not the slightest idea how 
to get those vac-skull Guardsmen 
to stop this stupidity and go home. 
Why bother keeping them alive just 
to waste themselves playing bang- 
bang-you’re-dead? 

She spent most of her hours of 
burial trying to think of a plan. She 
had been told to get a first-hand ac- 
quaintance with the Jopat situa- 
tion, and formulate a scheme based 
on that direct knowledge. So she 
tried to formulate. The result was a 
big empty zero. 

The damned barbs were where 
they wanted to be, doing what they 
wanted to do. And they knew what 
their duties in the Commonality 
were like — that their little game 
here was a war much more to their 
taste than the econo-war. 

And though she called them 
stupid, she knew they were not 
weak-minded. They knew what 
they liked — that was for sure. And 
nobody was going to trick them into 
thinking they would like something 
else better when experience told 
them otherwise. 



So . what should she do? 
What could she do? 

Not a damned thing. 

She sighed finally and returned 
her attention to her surroundings. 
All was still above. The battle was 
over and the barbs had retired. 

Slowly she expanded her shield- 
screen, employing it as an earth- 
mover. The debris yielded stub- 
bornly with creaks and scrapings as 
she poured power into the screen. 
The surface of the mound bulged 
up. Rocks and tree trunks rolled 
and toppled down its sides, and the 
bulge pushed up still higher. 
Finally an opening appeared at the 
top and Gweanvin, semi-inert, 
squirted herself through it, the hole 
collapsing back as she lifted above 
the dark treetops and streaked 
northward. 

When she reached the Green- 
Ten camp she dropped quietly to 
the ground, hoping the barbs had 
left her some supper. More than 
food was waiting for her. Her ar- 
rival triggered a celebration, in the 
loud, tumultuous barb style, that 
lasted into the morning hours. She 
was hugged, kissed, fondled and 
fed until she nearly turned on her 
shieldscreen in self-defense. 

General Dargow came shortly be- 
fore midnight to bestow the Best in 
Battle award for the day on her. 
After that brief interruption, the 
party resumed. And Gweanvin had 
to admit it was fun. 

But a similar shindig, following 
the next battle three night later. 



LITTLE GAME 



171 




was too much of a repetition to be 
quite so enjoyable. The barbs of 
Green-Ten were even more de- 
lirious than before. They were 
carried away by the glory of their 
cute little snip of a sniper taking 
two Best in Battle awards in a row! 

The battle itself had not devel- 
oped quite the same as the first. 
The Lonnies had sent no anti-sniper 
patrols forward in the Green-Ten 
sector, and when fighting had 
begun to develop elsewhere Gwean- 
vin and the others along the line 
had been allowed to advance in 
search of the enemy. She found 
them, to their regret. 

The third time she saw action, 
the Lonnies hit the Green-Ten 
sector with a sudden massive as- 
sault; no preliminaries. Gweanvin 
had halfway anticipated that tactic, 
and with Surants’ prior approval 
had never perched at all. She kept 
walking and crawling south 
throughout the long midday wait- 
ing period without benefit of life- 
support. When the Lonnies struck, 
she was far enough behind their 
front elements to bob up unexpect- 
edly in their midst, where she had a 
lone-hand advantage similar to, 
though not as great as, that in her 
space encounter on the day of her 
arrival. She created confusion and 
havoc while vaporizing one Lonnie 
and lancing at least five more 
before she caught a lance through 
the right shoulder and had to stage 
a zig-zag-zogging retreat north- 
ward. 



Another Best in Battle award, 
and another celebration. 

S he was transferred to command 
of a twelve-man assault squad 
in Purple-Eighteen. Training a 
whole week for that new assign- 
ment, she missed two battles. 

Back in action with her shoulder 
totally healed, she demanded no 
less from her squad men than she 
did from herself. They did not 
come through brilliantly in her 
opinion, and she let them know it. 
But they drew the crowd in four 
successive engagements, with re- 
sulting Granny victories. 

Then General Dargow called a 
staff meeting and ordered Gwean- 
vin to be present. The assembled 
officers sat in a natural amphi- 
theater near Battle Headquarters, 
studying the half-chagrined emo- 
pattern of the general as he stood 
up to face them. 

“I’ve had comm with General 
Brastig of the Lonnies,” he an- 
nounced. “He wants a parley, to 
consider rules revisions. I’m inclin- 
ed to agree with him.” 

‘‘What the hell for, chief?” 
someone in the crowd called out. 

“Because the game’s got one- 
sided, that’s what for!” 

This brought silence. Gweanvin 
could read the concern of the barbs 
around her. Maybe the econo-war 
was not their game, but the basic 
philosophy of it — that competition 
is an end in itself and must never be 
allowed to decay by becoming un- 



172 



GALAXY 




even — was something they under- 
stood. It was great to win battles, 
but winning a war was as unthink- 
able as losing one. 

“We got good rules!” a rumbling 
voice objected. “Them Lonnies 
oughta get theirselves a Gweanvin 
of their own, if they want the sides 
evened up.” 

Gweanvin blinked. Damn! Was 
this business of changing the rules 
all on account of her? 

After a moment of thought, she 
realized it was. It had not occurred 
to her before that in a bloody fight 
with close to a million barbs en- 
gaged on each side, her own esca- 
pades, award-winning though they 
were, could make that much differ- 
ence. 

Dargow was answering the 
nimbler: “I guess they would like 
to. But the Federation hasn’t sent a 
Gweanvin out to try to bring them 
home — if the Fed’s got Gweanvin’s 
equal, which I doubt. Now, what I 
want us to do is figure out some 
rules changes that will give the 
Lonnies a better break without 
hampering ourselves too much. 
That way we can go to the parley 
with — ” 

“Hold it, general!” yelled 
Gweanvin, leaping to her feet. 

He stared questioningly at her. 

“Leave your silly rules alone,” 
she told him. “I’ve said all along 
that this is a little game you yaps 
are playing, and I see now 1 wasn’t 
kidding! It’s too damned little for 
me to fit in. You can count me 



out — because I’m going home!” 
Bellows of protest roared from 
the officers. Gweanvin stood un- 
swayed, her chin jutting with deter- 
mination. And despite the yells, she 
could read a growing agreement in 
the crowd, and also in Dargow, 
that her departure would be the 
best answer — better than tamper- 
ing with the rules. Soon the protests 
died away. 

“What about your mission?” 
asked the general. 

She spat an obscenity. “I’ll tell 
the desk-riders back home where to 
shove their mission.” 

“Damn it, Gweanvin,” Nathel 
Gromon spoke up. “I hate to see 
you get pushed out of the game.” 
“Don’t bawl about if,” she told 
him. “This is a boring war you’re 
having, and I’ve been playing just 
to kill time while I tried to formu- 
late a plan. I’ve had a bellyful, 
thank you.” She turned slowly to 
glance over the sobered faced. “So 
long, meatheads.” She grinned at 
them. “Good shooting!” 

She went semi-inert and streaked 
up through the trees. For a moment 
she thought of going by her squad’s 
camp to tell her men goodbye in 
person, but she decided to hell with 
it. She soared on up through the at- 
mosphere and into the vacuum of 
space, her breathing going on in- 
ternal mode. 

Once in clear vacuum, she set a 
vector for Prima Gran and went 
into warp. Only then did she 
contact headquarters. 



LITTLE GAME

“GO to HQ SA-Forty.” 

"Yes, Gweanvin. Smitwak here. " 

“Chalk up one flop to the cute 
little broad,” she gritted. “It was a 
stinking mission to start with, and 
I’d like to get on memtacomm just 
once with the wise guys who dream- 
ed it up!” 

"You can't, Gweanvin. They’re 
off the Bauble network. Security, 
vou know. ” 

Gweanvin grunted. Smitwak of- 
ten took a remark literally when 
caught unawares. “Never mind,” 
she sighed. ‘‘Just tell them I’m 
coming in, mission unaccomplish- 
ed.” 

"Okay. Win some, lose some. 
That's life, Gweanvin. ” 

“Thanks for the platitudes,” she 
snarled. “I’ll quote you in my 
memoirs. Out.” 

“ Don’t kick yourself all the way 
home." Smitwak said. "Frankly, 
vou kept working on this one longer 
than l expected you to. You have 
great perseverance. Out. " 

S mitwak’s solicitude was unnec- 
essary. Gweanvin had no inten- 
tion of blaming herself for the 
failure of the mission. When the di- 
rectors of the Special Assignments 
Bureau misfigured as badly as they 
had on this one, the fault did not lie 
with the operative in the field. The 
directors had flubbed, and she 
looked forward to telling them so. 

But now, with five days of warp- 
flight ahead of her, she relaxed. 



Soon she was in the space traveler’s 
semi-doze — a hibernative state that 
could eat up the light-years with 
minimal awareness of time’s pas- 
sage. Every ten hours she would 
rouse long enough to swallow a 
food-concentrate pill and check on 
the progress of her journey. Then 
she would slide back into dor- 
mancy. 

"HQ SA-Forty to GO. ” 

The call snapped her alert when 
she was three days out from Jopat. 

“Okay, Smitty, I’m awake. What 
is it?” 

"Bard Lustempo will tell you. 
Here he is. " 

Lustempo was one of the Bu- 
reau’s directors. Gweanvin’s lip 
curled. If that guy tried to give her 
a song and dance — or send her 
back to Jopat . 

"Miss Oster, ” came Lustempo’s 
voice. "I wanted the pleasure of 
giving you the good news person- 
ally. Your mission was a success. 
The Guardsmen are returning. 
Dargow reported their departure 
from Jopat twelve minutes ago. 
Congratulations are in order. Miss 
Oster. ” 

“But . but . .” Gweanvin 
sputtered. “The mission flopped!” 

"By no means," the director 
assured her jovially. "It went essen- 
tially as we expected. ” 

“But I never even figured out a 
plan,” she protested. “If those 
lumpybrains are coming home, it’s 
because they finally got as bored 
with their little game as I got in

three weeks — not because of any 
plot of mine!” 

“Precisely, Miss Os ter. And why 
do you suppose they got bored?" 

“You asked that question for the 
pleasure of answering it yourself,” 
she told him evenly, “so go ahead.” 

Lustempo chuckled. “I will. Our 
Guardsmen fought one battle fol- 
lowing your departure and discov- 
ered the excitement you brought to 
their game was gone. Also, there 
was some business about changing 
the rules to accomodate your pres- 
ence. That helped bring home the 
point to them — a point they could 
not be TOLD convincingly, but had 
to be shown. I refer, of course, to 
the limited scope and interest of 
their game ... in short, to its little- 
ness. ” 

“It was too little for me,” she 
said. 

“ Correct . And despite the short- 
comings of the econo-war from the 
viewpoint of the genetic barbarians, 
Miss Os ter, you convinced them by 
vour actions rather than by words 
that any competition in which you 
participated had to hold more ex- 
citement than a competition that 
excluded you. In short. Miss Os ter, 
they want to be in your war. " 

“Oh . then I wasn’t expected 
to come up with a scheme at all,” 
she replied thoughtfully. “That was 
just your way of getting me to hang 
around Jopat and — and play their 
game for a while.” 

“Yes. Some situations. Miss 
Os ter, are not really soluble by plot 



alone. This is a lesson that should 
be well learned by those who seek to 
direct the activities of others. No 
scheme we — or you — might have 
formulated could have overcome 
the stubborn determination of the 
Guardsmen and brought them 
home willingly. That situation had 
to be resolved by allowing the 
persons involved to pursue their 
natural inclinations. Our formula- 
tion was thus one of selection of a 
person or persons to inject into the 
situation to bring about the desired 
resolution. Thus we saw to it you 
became involved in the Guards- 
men's game — and allowed events to 
take their course. ” 

“Nice of you.” 

“ While you are not an overly 
modest person. Miss Oster," the 
director continued, “I wonder if 
you realize the powerfully catalytic 
effect you tend to. have in all 
matters in which you ...” 

Gweanvin yawned. That was the 
way of desk-riders like Lustempo — 
jabber-jabber-jabber! Well, maybe 
they needed to talk a lot as a sub- 
stitute for action. Old Lustempo’s 
praise of her, which was still dron- 
ing on in her ear, was really patting 
himself and his Bureau colleagues 
on the back for being so clever in 
sending her to Jopat. 

Well ... It had been pretty 
bright of them, at that. 

She yawned again, keyed herself 
to rouse and say “thank you” when 
Lustempo finally unwound, and 
dozed off. ★
