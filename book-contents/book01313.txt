WHAT YOU DON’T KNOW ABOUT YOU 



H eard any of these statements 
lately? 

“ Women are as intelligent as 
men— I.Q. tests prove it.” “Animal 
mothers often adopt babies of other 
species as their own — witness cats 
and new born rabbits — so those 
stories about wolf-boys raised in 
the jungle could be true.” “Negroes 
are intrinsically less educable than 
Europeans; the state of civilization 
in Africa proves it.” Or its oppo- 
site: “There is absolutely no dif- 
ference, intellectually or biological- 
ly, between races; all men are cre- 
ated not only equal but identical.” 
If you have heard them — or any 
of thousands of “clearly proved” or 
“well known” alleged facts like 
them that turn up in around-the- 
cocktail-table discussions of human 
beings and their manifold strange- 
nesses, a book we have just read 
called Your Heredity and Environ- 
ment hy Amram Scheinfeld (Lippin- 
eott) will surprise and fascinate 
ou. True, boys and girls in mass 
testing get identical scores on I.Q. 
tests; but what we, at least didn’t 
know — and what Scheinfeld points 
out brilliantly — is that there is a 
reason for this: all I.Q. tests have 
been systematically “corrected” to 
make male and female results come 
out equal.. For every “boy-oriented” 
question, a “girl-oriented” question 
has been conscientously added. The 
wolf-boys? Well, says Scheinfeld, 
apart from all the other argu- 
ments against them, consider one 
thing: the human infant requires 
longer nursing than any other — 



and no mother but a human mother 
is naturally equipped to provide 
that much nursing. As to the ques- 
tion of race differences, if any, 
Scheinfeld makes a crystal-clear 
case. Mast “racial” differences are 
clearly environmental, not innate — 
Negroes score somewhat lower on 
I.Q. tests than whites; but Northern 
Negroes score higher • than South- 
ern whites — presumably because of 
the presence of better schools, bet- 
ter public health services and may- 
be a more technologically demand- 
ing culture. But some differences 
can’t be explained that way. For 
example, some nationalities thrive 
on an article of diet called the fava 
bean; others develop a serious ill- 
ness from it. South African whites 
suffer from a disease called Por- 
phyria variegata; other whites, 
and almost all Negroes, practically 
never have it. In the case of the 
South Africans, says Scheinfeld, 
the hereditary factors can be traced 
back to a single Afrikaner family 
(named Gerrit) ; and what is at 
work is not so much racial differ- 
ence but genetic drift. 

In other words, X nationality 
may indeed be somewhat more like- 
ly to show a certain trait than any 
other. But an X-man doesn’t in- 
herit the trait because his ances- 
tors were X-men ; he inherits i$ 
from certain particular ancestors 
. Well, there’s lots more; but 
it’s a book worth reading. We en- 
joyed it . and we can think of 

a few people who need it!

TIGER GREEN 

by GORDON R. DICKSON 



ILLUSTRATED BY ADKINS 



Something on the planet loved 
people — loved them enough to 
free them from their lives / 



I 

A man with hallucinations he can- 
not stand trying to strangle 
himself in a home-made straitjacket 
is not a pretty sight. But after a 
while, grimly thought Jerry McWhin, 
the Star Scout's navigator, the ugly 
and terrible seem to backfire in ef- 
fect, filling you with fury instead of 
harrowing you further. Men in 
crowds and packs could be stam- 
peded briefly, but after a while the 
individual among them would turn, 



get his back up, and slash back. 

At least — the hyper-stubborn in- 
dividual in himself had finally so 
reacted. 

Determinedly, with fingers that 
fumbled from lack of sleep, he got 
the strangling man — Wally Blake, 
an assistant ecologist — untangled 
and into a position where it would 
be difficult for him to try to choke 
out his own life, again. Then Jerry 
went out of the sickbay storeroom, 
leaving Wally and the other seven 
men out of the Star Scout's comple- 



5 




ment of twelve who were in total 
restraint. He was lightheaded from 
exhaustion; but a berserk something 
in him snarled like a cornered tiger 
and refused to break like Wally and 
the others. 

When all’s said and done, he 
thought half-crazily, there’s worse 
ways to come to the end of it than 
a last charge, win or lose, alone into 
the midst of all your enemies. 

Going down the corridor, the 
sight of another figure jolted him a 
little back toward common sense. 
Ben Akham, the drive engineer, 
came trudging back from the air- 
lock corridor with a flame thrower 
on his back. Soot etched darkly the 
lines on his once-round face. 

“Get the hull cleared?” asked 
Jerry. Ben nodded exhausted^. 

“There’s more jungle on her every 
morning,” he grunted. “Now those 
big thistles are starting to drip a 
corrosive liquid. The hull needs an 
anti-acid washing. I can’t do it. I’m 
worn out.” 

“We all are,” said Jerry. His own 
five-eleven frame was down to a 
hundred and thirty-eight pounds. 
There was plenty of food — it was 
just that the four men left on their 
feet had no time to prepare it; and 
little enough time to eat it, prepared 
or not. 

Exploration Team Five-Twentv- 
Nine, thought Jerry, had finally bit- 
ten off more than it could chew, 
here on the second planet of Star 
83476. It was nobody’s fault. It had 
been a gamble for Milt Johnson, the 
Team Captain, either way — to land 
or not to land. He had landed; and 
it had turned out bad. 



B y such small things was the scale 
toward tragedy tipped. A com- 
munication problem with the natives, 
a native jungle evidently determined 
to digest the spaceship, and eight 
of twelve men down with something 
like suicidal delirium tremens — any 
two of these things the Team could 
probably have handled. 

But not all three at once. 

Jerry and Ben reached the en- 
trance of the Control Room togeth- 
er and peered in, looking for Milt 
Johnson. 

“Must be ootside, talking to that 
native again,” said Jerry. 

“Ootside? — Oof-side!” exploded 
Ben, with a sudden snapping of 
frayed nerves. “Can’t you say ‘out- 
side'? — ‘Owf-side’, like everybody 
else?” 

The berserk something in Jerry 
lunged to be free, but he caught it 
and hauled it back. 

“Get hold of yourself!” he snap- 
ped. 

“Well ... I wouldn’t mind you 
sounding like a blasted Scotchman 
all the time!” growled Ben, getting 
himself, nevertheless, somewhat un- 
der control. “It’s just you always do 
it when I don’t expect it!” 

“If the Lord wanted us all to 
sound alike, he’d have propped up 
the Tower of Babel,” said Jerry 
wickedly. He was not particularly 
religious himself, but he knew Ben 
to be a table-thumping atheist. He 
had the satisfaction now of watching 
the other man bite his lips and con- 
trol himself in his turn. 

Academically, however, Jerry 
thought as they both headed out 
through the ship to find Milt, he 



4 



IP 




could not really blame Ben. For 
Jerry, like many Scot-Canadians, ap- 
peared to speak a very middle-west- 
ern American sort of English most 
of the time. But only as long as he 
avoided such vocabulary items as 
‘house’ and ‘out’; which popped off 
Jerry’s tongue as ‘hoose’ and ‘oot’. 
However, every man aboard had his 
personal peculiarities. You had to 
get used to them. That was part of 
spaceship — in fact, part of human 
— life. 

They emerged from the lock, 
rounded the nose of the spaceship, 
and found themselves in the neat 
little clearing on one side of the 
ship where the jungle paradoxically 
refused to grow. In this clearing 
stood the broad-shouldered figure 
of Milt Johnson, his whitish-blond 
hair glinting in the yellow- white 
sunlight. 

F acing Milt was the thin, naked, 
and saddle-colored, humanoid 
figure of one of the natives from 
the village, or whatever it was, about 
twenty minutes away by jungle trail. 
Between Milt and the native was 
the glittering metal console of the 
translator machine. 

“. Let’s try it once more,” they 
heard Milt saying as they came up 
and stopped behind him. 

The native gabble agreeably. 
“Yes, yes. Try it again,” trans- 
lated the voice of the console. 

“I am Captain Milton Johnson. I 
am in authority over the crew of the 
ship you see before me.” 

“Gladly would I not see it,” re- 
plied the console on translation of 
the native’s gabblings. “However — 



I am Communicator, messenger to 
you sick ones.” 

“I will call you Communicator, 
then,” began Milt. 

“Of course. What else could you 
call me?” 

“Please,” said Milt, wearily. “To 
get back to it — I also am a Com- 
municator.” 

“No, no,” said the native. “You 
are not a Communicator. It is the 
sickness that makes you talk this 
way.” 

“But,” said Milt, and Jerry saw 
the big, white-haired captain swal- 
low in an attempt to keep his tem- 
per. “You will notice, I am com- 
municating with you.” 

“No, no.” 

“I see,” said Milt patiently, “You 
mean, we aren’t communicating in 
the sense that we aren’t understand- 
ing each other. We’re talking, but 
you don’t understand me — ” 

“No, no. I understand you per- 
fectly.” 

“Well,” said Milt, exhaustedly, “I 
don’t understand you.” 

‘That is because you are sick.” 
Milt blew out a deep breath and 
wiped his brow. 

“Forget that part of it, then,” he 
said. “Many of my crew are upset 
by nightmares we all have been hav- 
ing. They are sick. But there are still 
four of us who are well — ” 

“No, no. You are all sick,” said 
Communicator earnestly. “But you 
should love what you call night- 
mares. All people love them.” 
“Including you and your people?” 
“Of course. Love your night- 
mares They will make you well. 
They will make the little bit of

proper life in you grow, and heal 

B en snorted beside Jerry. Jerry 
could sympathize with the other 
man. The nightmares he had been 
having during his scant hours of 
deep, the past two weeks, came back 
to his mind, with the indescribably 
alien, terrifying sensation of drifting 
in a sort of environmental soup 
with identifiable things changing 
abape and identity constantly around 
him. Even pumped full of tranquil- 
izers, he thought — which reminded 
Jerry. 

He had not taken hs tranquilizers 
lately. 

When had he taken some last? 
Hot since he woke up, in any case. 
Not since . yesterday, sometime. 
Though that was now hard to be- 
lieve. 

“Let's forget that, too, then.” Milt 
was saying. “Now, the jungle is 
growing all over our ship, in spite 
of all we can do. You tell me your 
people can make the jungle do any- 
thing you want." 

“Yes, yes,” said Communicator, 
agreeably. 

“Then, will you please stop it 
from growing all over our space- 
ship?” 

“We understand. It is your sick- 
ness, the poison that makes you say 
this. Do not fear. We will never 
abandon you.” Communicator look- 
ed almost ready to pat Milt consol- 
ingly on the head. “You are people, 
who are more important than any 
cost. Soon you will grow and cast 
off your poisoned part and come to 
us.” 



“But we can come to you right 
now!” said Milt, between his teeth. 
“In fact — we’ve come to your vil- 
lage a dozen times.” 

“No, no.” Communicator sounded 
distressed. “You approach, but you 
do not come. You have never come 
to us.” 

Milt wiped his forehead with the 
back of a wide hand. “I will come 
back to your village now, with you.” 
he said. “Would you like that?” he 
asked. 

“I would be so happy!” said Com- 
municator. “But — you will not 
come. You say it, but you do not 
come.” 

“All right. Wait — ” about to take 
a hand transceiver from the console, 
Milt saw the other two men. “Jerry,” 
he said, “you go this time. Maybe 
he’ll believe it if it’s you who goes 
to the village with him.” 

“I’ve been there before. With you, 
the second time you went,” objected 
Jerry. “And I’ve got to feed the 
men in restraint, pretty soon,” he 
added. 

“Try going again. That’s all we 
can do — try things. Ben and I’ll 
feed the men,” said Milt. Jerry, 
about to argue further, felt the pres- 
sure of a sudden wordless, exhausted 
appeal from Milt. Milt’s basic ber- 
serkedness must be just about ready 
to break loose, too, he realized. 

“All right,” said Jerry. 

“Good,” said Milt, looking grate- 
ful. “We have to keep trying. I 
should have lifted ship while I still 
had five well men to lift it with. 
Come on, Ben — you and I better go 
feed those men now, before we fall 
asleep on our feet.”

T hey went away around the nose 
of the ship. Jerry unhooked the 
Kttle black-and-white transceiver, 
that would radio-relay his conversa- 
tions with Communicator back to 
the console of the translator for 
sense-making during the trip. 

“Come on," he said to Commu- 
nicator, and led off down the pleas- 
antly wide jungle trail toward the 
native village. 

They passed from under the little 
patch of open sky above the clear- 
ing and into green-roofed stillness. 
All about them, massive limbs, 
branches, ferns and vines intertwin- 
ed in a majestic maze of growing 
things. Small flying creatures, look- 
ing half-animal and half-insect, flit- 
tered among the branches overhead. 
Some larger, more animal-like, crea- 
tures sat on the heavier limbs and 
moaned off-key like abandoned pup- 
pies. Jerry’s head spun with his wear- 
iness, and the green over his head 
seemed to close down on him like 
a net flung by some giant, crazy 
fisherman, to take him captive. 

He was suddenly and bitterly re- 
minded of the Team’s high hopes, 
the day they had set down on this 
world. No other Team or Group had 
yet to turn up any kind of alien life 
much more intelligent than an an- 
thropoid ape. Now they, Team 529, 
had not only uncovered an intelli- 
gent, evidently semi-cultured alien 
people, but an alien people eager 
to establish relations with the hu- 
mans and communicate. Here, two 
weeks later, the natives were still 
apparently just as eager to com- 



municate, but what they said made 
no sense. 

Nor did it help that, with the 
greatest of patience and kindness, 
Communicator and his kind seem- 
ed to consider that it was the hu- 
mans who were irrational and un- 
communicative. 

Nor that meanwhile, that the jun- 
gle seemed to be mounting a speci- 
fically directed attack on the human 
spaceship. 

Nor that the nightmare afflicting 
the humans had already laid low 
eight of the twelve crew and were 
grinding the four left on their feet 
down to a choice between suicidal 
delirium or collapse from exhaus- 
tion. 

I t was a miracle, thought Jerry, 
lightheadedly trudging through 
the jungle, that the four of them had 
been able to survive as long as they 
had. A miracle based probably on 
some individual chance peculiarity of 
strength that the other eight men 
in straitjackets lacked.^ Although, 
thought Jerry now, that strength 
that was had so far defied analysis. 
Dizzily, like a man in a high fever, 
he considered their four surviving 
personalities in his mind’s eye. They 
were, he thought, the four men of 
the team with what you might call 
the biggest mental crochets. 

— Or ornery streaks. 

Take the fourth member of the 
group — the Medician, Arthyr Loy, 
who had barely stuck his nose out 
of the sick bay lab in the last forty- 
eight hours. Not only because he 
was the closest thing to an M.D. 
aboard the ship, was Art still deter- 



10 



IF 




■lined to put the eight restrained 
men back on their feet again. It just 
happened, in addition, that Art con- 
sidered himself the only true profes- 
sional man aboard, and was not the 
kind to admit any inability to the 
lesser mortals about him. 

And Milt Johnson — Milt made 
an excellent captain. He was a tower 
of strength, a great man for making 
decisions. The only thing was, that 
having decided, Milt could hardly 
be brought to consider the remote 
possibility that anyone else might 
have wanted to decide differently. 

Ben Akham was another matter. 
Ben hated religion and loved ma- 
chinery — and the jungle surround- 
ing was attacking his spaceship. In 
fact, Jerry was willing to bet that by 
the time he got back, Ben would be 
washing the hull with an acid-coun- 
teractant in spite of what he had 
told Jerry earlier. 

And himself? Jerry? Jerry shook 
his head woozily. It was hard to be 
self-analytical after ten days of three 
and four hours sleep per twenty. He 
had what his grandmother had once 
described as the curse of the Gael 
— black stubbornness and red rages. 

All of these traits, in all four of 
them, had normally been buried 
safely below the surfaces of their 
personalities and had only colored 
them as individuals. But now, the 
last two weeks had worn those sur- 
faces down to basic personality bed- 
rock. Jerry shoved the thought out 
of his mind. 

“Well,” he said, turning to Com- 
municator, “we’re almost to your 
village now . You can’t say some- 
one didn't come with you, this time.” 



Communicator gabbled. The trans-' 
ceiver in Jerry’s hand translated. 

“Alas,” the native said, “bitf you 
are not with me.” 

“Cut it out!” said Jerry wearily. 
“I’m right here beside you.” 

“No,” said Communicator. “You 
accompany me, but you are not here. 
You are back with your dead 

things.” 

“You mean the ship and the rest 
of it?” asked Jerry. 

“There is no ship,” said Com- 
municator. “A ship must have 

grown and been alive. Your thing 

has always been dead. But we will 
save you.” 

Ill 

T hey came out of the path at last 
into a clearing dotted with whit- 
ish, pumpkin-like shells some ten 
feet in height above the brown earth 
in which they were half-buried. 

Wide cracks in the out-curving sides 
gave view of tangled roots and plants 
inside, among which other natives 
could be seen moving about, scratch- 
ing, tasting and making holes in the 
vegetable surfaces. 

“Well,” said Jerry, making an ef- 
fort to speak cheerfully, “here I 
am.” 

“You are not here.” 

The berserk tigerishness in Jerry 
leaped up unawares and took him 
by the inner throat. For a long sec- 
ond he looked at Communicator 
through a red haze. Communica- 
tor gazed back patiently, evidently 
unaware how close he was to hav- 
ing his neck broken by a pair of 
human hands.

“Look — ■** said Jerry, slowly, be- 
tween his teeth, getting himself un- 
der control, “if you will just tell me 
what to do to join you and your 
people, here, I will do it.” 

“That is good!” 

“Then,” said Jerry, still with both 
hands on the inner fury that fought 
to tear loose inside him, “what do 
I do?” 

“But you know — ” The enthus- 
iasm that had come into Commun- 
icator a moment before, wavered 
visibly. “You must get rid of the 
dead things, and set yourself free to 
grow, inside. Then, after you have 
grown, your unsick self will bring 
you here to join us!” 

Jerry stared back. Patience, he 
said harshly to himself. 

“Grow? How? In what way?” 

“But you have a little bit of pro- 
per life in you,” explained Com- 
municator. “Not much, of course 
. but if you will rid yourself of 
dead things and concentrate on 
what you call nightmares, it will 
grow and force out the poison of 
the dead life in you. The proper 
life and the nightmares are the hope 
for you — ” 

“Wait a minuter Jerry’s exhaus- 
tion-fogged brain cleared suddenly 
and nearly miraculously at the sud- 
den surge of excitement into his 
bloodstream. “This proper life you 
talk about — does it have something 
to do with the nightmares?” 

“Of course. How could you have 
what you call nightmares without a 
little proper life in you to give them 
to you? As the proper life grows, 
you will cease to fight so against 
the ‘nightmares’ . 



Communicator continued to talk 
earnestly. But Jerry’s spinning brain 
was flying off on a new tangent. 
What was it he had been dunking 
earlier about tranquilizers — that hi 
had not taken any himself for some 
time? Then, what about the night- 
mares in his last four hours of 
sleep? 

He must have had them — he 
remembered now that he had had 
them. But evidently they had not 
bothered him as much as before — 
at least, not enough to send him 
scrambling for tranquilizers to dufi 
the dreams’ weird impact on him. 

“Communicator!” Jerry grabbed 
at the thin, leathery-skinned arm of 
die native. “Have I been chang — 
growing?” 

“I do not know, of course,” said 
the native, courteously. “I profound- 
ly hope so. Have you?” 

“Excuse me — ” gulped Jerry. 
“I’ve got to get oot of here — bade 
to th* ship!” 

H e turned, and raced back up 
the trail. Some twenty minutes 
later, he burst into the clearing be- 
fore the ship to find an ominous 
silence hanging over everything. 
Only the faint rustle and hissing 
from the ever-growing jungle swal- 
lowing up the ship sounded on Ws 
eardrums. 

“Milt — Ben!” he shouted, plung- 
ing into the ship. “Art!” 

A hail from farther down the 
main corridor reassured him, and he 
followed it up to find all three un- 
restrained members of the crew in 
the sickbay. But — Jerry brought 
himself up short, his throat closing 



12 



IP 




on him — there was a figure on the 
table. 

“Who . began Jerry. Milt 
Johnson turned around to face him. 
The captain’s big body mercifully 
hid most of the silent form on the 
table. 

“Wally Blake,” said Milt emptily. 
“He managed to strangle himself 
after all. Got twisted up in his re- 
straint jacket. Ben and I heard him 
thumping around in there, but by 
the time we got to him, it was too 
late. Art’s doing an autopsy.” 

“Not exactly an autopsy,” came 
the soft, Virginia voice of the Me- 
dician from beyond Milt. “Just look- 
ing for something I suspected . 
and here it is!” 

Milt spun about and Jerry push- 
ed between the big captain and Ben. 
He found himself looking at the 
back of a human head from which 
a portion of the skull had been re- 
moved. What he saw before him was 
a small expanse of whitish, soft, in- 
ner tissue that was the brainstem; 
and fastened to it almost like a 
grape growing there, was a small, 
purplish mass. 

Art indicated the purple shape 
with the tip of a sharp, surgical in- 
strument. 

“There,” he said. “And I bet 
we’ve each got one.” 

“What is it?” asked Ben’s voice, 
hushed and a little nauseated. 

“I don’t know,” said Art harshly. 
“How the devil would I be able to 
tell? But I found organisms in the 
bloodstreams of those of us I’ve 
taken blood samples from — organ- 
isms like spores, that look like this, 
only smaller, microscopic in size.” 



“You didn’t tell me that!” said 
Milt, turning quickly to face him. 

4 6TT7hat was the point?” Art 
VV turned toward the Team 
Captain. Jerry saw that the Medi- 
cian’s long face was almost blood- 
less. “I didn’t know what they were. 
I thought if I kept looking, I might 
know more. Then I could have 
something positive to tell you, as 
well as the bad news. But — it’s no 
use now.” 

“Why do you say that?” snapped 
Milt. 

“Because it’s the truth.” Art’s face 
seemed to slide apart, go loose and 
waxy with defeat. “As long as it was 
something non-physical we were 
fighting, there was some hope we 
could throw it off. But — you see 
what’s going on inside us. We’re 
being changed physically. That’s 
where the nightmares come from. 
You can’t overcome a physical 
change with an effort of will!” 

“What about the Grotto at 
Lourdes?” asked Jerry. His head 
was whirling strangely with a mass 
of ideas. His own great-grandfather 
— the family story came back to 
mind — had been judged by his phy- 
sician in eighteen ninety-six to have 
advanced pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Going home from the doctor’s of- 
fice, Simon Fraser McWhin had de- 
cided that he could not afford to 
have tuberculosis at this time. That 
he would not, therefore, have tuber- 
culosis at all. And he had dismissed 
the matter fully from his mind. 

One year later, examined by the 
same physician, he had no signs of 
tuberculosis whatsoever.

But in this present moment, Art. 
curling up in his chair at the end of 
the table, seemed not to have heard 
Jerry’s question. And Jerry was sud- 
denly reminded of the question that 
had brought him pelting back from 
the native village. 

“Is it growing — I mean was it 
growing when Wally strangled him- 
self — that growth on his brain?” 
he asked. 

Art roused himself. 

“Growing?” he repeated dully. He 
climbed to his feet and picked up 
an instrument. He investigated the 
purple mass for a moment. 

“No,” he said, dropping the in- 
strument wearily and falling back 
into his chair. “Looks like its outer 
layer has died and started to be re- 
absorbed — I think.” He put his 
head in his hands. “I’m not quali- 
fied to answer such questions. I’m 
not trained . .” 

“Who is?” demanded Milt, grim- 
ly, looming over the table and the 
rest of them. “And we’re reaching 
the limit of our strength as well as 
the limits of what we know — ” 
“We’re done for,” muttered Ben. 
His eyes were glazed, looking at the 
dissected body on the table. “It’s 
not my fault — ” 

“Catch him! Catch Art!” shouted 
Jerry, leaping forward. 

B ut he was too late. The Medician 
had been gradually curling up 
in his chair since he had sat down 
in it again. Now, he slipped out of 
it to the floor, rolled in a ball, and 
lay still. 

“Leave him alone.” Milt’s large 
hand caught Jerry and held him 



back. “He may as well lie there at 
someplace else.” He got to his feet. 
“Ben’s right. We’re done for.” 

“Done for?” Jerry stared at the 
big man. The words he had just 
heard were words he would never 
have imagined hearing from Milt. 

“Yes,” said Milt. He seemed 
somehow to be speaking from a long 
distance off. 

“Listen — ” said Jerry. The tiger- 
ishness inside him had woken at 
Milt’s words. It tugged and snarled 
against the words of defeat from the 
captain’s lips. “We’re winning. We 
aren’t losing!” 

“Quit it, Jerry,” said Ben dully, 
from the far end of the room. 

“Quit it — ?” Jerry swung on the 
engineer. “You lost your temper 
with me before I went down to the 
village, about the way I said 'oot'l 
How could you lose your temper if 
you were full of tranquilizers? I 
haven’t been taking any myself, and 
I feel better because of it. Don’t tell 
me you’ve been taking yours! — 
And that means we’re getting strong- 
er than the nightmares.” 

“The tranquilizer’ve been making 
me sick, if you must know! That’s 
why I haven’t been taking them — ” 
Ben broke off, his face graying. He 
pointed a shaking finger at the pur- 
plish mass. “I’m being changed, 
that’s why they made me sick! I’m 
changing already!” His' voice rose 
toward a scream. “Don’t you see, 
it’s changing me — ” He broke off, 
suddenly screaming and leaping at 
Milt with clawing fingers. “We’re all 
changing! And it’s your fault for 
bringing the ship down here. You 
did it—”

IF 




Milt’s huge fist slammed into the 
side of the smaller man’s jaw, driv- 
ing him to the floor beside the still 
shape of the Medician, where he lay 
quivering and sobbing. 

Slowly Milt lifted his gaze from 
the fallen man and faced Jerry. It 
was the standard seventy-two de- 
grees Centigrade in the room, but 
Jerry saw perspiration standing out 
on Milt’s calm face as if he had 
just stepped out of a steam bath. 

“But he may be right,” said Milt, 
emotionlessly. His voice seemed to 
come from the far end of some 
lightless tunnel. “We may be chang- 
ing under the influence of those 
growths right now — each of us.” 
“Milt!” said Jerry, sharply. But 
Milt’s face never changed. It was 
large, and calm, and pale — and 
drenched with sweat. “Now’s the last 
time we ought to give up! We’re 
starting to understand it now. I tell 
you, the thing is to meet Commun- 
icator and the other natives head on! 
Head to head we can crack them 
wide open. One of us has to go 
down to that village.” 

“No. I’m the captain,” said Milt, 
his voice unchanged. “I’m respon- 
sible, and I’ll decide. We can’t lift 
ship with less than five men and 
there’s only two of us — you and I 
• — actually left. I can’t risk one of 
us coming under the influence of 
the growth in him, and going over 
to the alien side.” 

“Going over?” Jerry stared at 
him. 

44^Tphat’s what all this has been 
A for — the jungle, the natives, 
the nightmare.. They want to take us 



over.” Sweat ran down Milt’s cheeks 
and dripped off his chin, while he 
continued to talk tonelessly and gaze 
straight ahead. ‘They’ll send us — 
what’s left of us — back against our 
own people. I can’t let that happen- 
We’ll have to destroy ourselves so 
there’s nothing for them to use.” 
“Milt — ” said Jerry. 

“No.” Milt swayed faintly on his 
feet like a tall tree under a wind too 
high to be felt on the ground at its 
base. “We can’t risk leaving ship or 
crew. We’ll blow the ship up with 
ourselves in it — ” 

“Blow up my ship f* 

It was a wild-animal scream from 
the floor at their feet; and Ben Ak- 
ham rose from almost under the 
table like a demented wildcat, aim- 
ing for Milt’s jugular vein. So un- 
expected and powerful was the at- 
tack that the big captain tottered 
and fell. With a noise like worrying 
dogs, they rolled together under tl ie 
table. 

The chained tiger inside Jerry 
broke its bonds and flung free. - 
He turned and ducked through the 
door into the corridor. It was a 
heavy pressure door with a wheel 
lock, activating metal dogs to seal it 
shut in case of a hull blowout and 
sudden loss of air. Jerry slammed 
the door shut, and spun the wheel. 

The dogs snicked home. Snatching 
down the portable fire extinguisher 
hanging on the wall alongside, Jerry 
dropped the foam container on the 
floor and jammed the metal nozzle 
of its hose between a spoke of the 
locking wheel and the unlocking stop 
on the door beneath it. 

He paused. There was silence in- 



TIGER GREEN 



15 




ride the sick bay lab. Then the 
wheel jerked against the nozzle and 
the door tried to open. 

“What’s going on?” demanded the 
voice of Milt. There was a pause. 
“Jerry, what’s going on out there? 
Open up!” 

A wild, crazy impulse to hysteri- 
cal laughter rose inside Jerry with- 
out warning. It took all his will 
power to choke it back. 

“You’re locked in, Milt,” he said. 

“Jerry!” The wheel spoke clicked 
against the jamming metal nozzle, 
in a futile effort to turn. “Open 
up! That’s an order!” 

“Sorry, Milt,” said Jerry softly 
and lightheadedly. “I’m not ready 
yet to burn the hoose about my ears. 
This business of you wanting to 
blow up the ship’s the same sort of 
impulse to suicide that got Wally 
and the rest. I’m off to face the na- 
tives now and let them have their 
way with me. I’ll be back later, to 
let you oot.” 

“Jerry!” 

Jerry heard Milt’s voice behind 
him as he went off down the corri- 
dor. 

" Jerry F There was a fussilade of 
pounding fists against the door, 
growing fainter as Jerry moved 
away. “Don’t you see? — That 
growth in you is finally getting you! 
Jerry, come back! Don’t let them 
take over one of us! Jerry . .” 

J erry left the noise and the ship 
together behind him as he step- 
ped out of the airlock. The jungle, 
he saw, was covering the ship’s hull 
again, already hiding it for the most 
part. He went on out to the transla- 



tor console and began taking off his 
clothes. When he was completely un- ! 
dressed, he unhooked the transceiv- 
er he had brought back from the 
native village, slung it on a loop of 
his belt, and hung the belt around 
his neck. 

He headed off down the trail to- 
ward the village, wincing a little as 
the soles of his shoeless feet came 
into contact with pebbles along the 
way. 

When he got to the village clear- 
ing, a naked shape he recognized as 
that of Communicator tossed up its 
arms in joy and came running to 
him. 

“Well,” said Jerry. “I’ve grown. 
I’ve got rid of the poison of dead 
things and the sickness. Here I am 
to join you!” 

“At last!” gabbled Communica- 
tor. Other natives were running up. 
“Throw away the dead thing around 
your neck!” 

“I still need it to understand you,” 
said Jerry. “I guess I need a little 
help to join you all the way.” 

“Help? We will help!” cried Com- 
municator. “But you must throw 
that away. You have rid yourself 
of the dead things that you kept 
wrapped around your limbs and 
body,” gabbled Communicator. 
“Now rid yourself of the dead thing 
hanging about your neck.” 

“But I tell you, if I do that,” ob- 
jected Jerry, “I won’t be able to 
understand you when you talk, or 
make you understand me!” 

“Throw it away. It is poisoning 
you! Throw it away!” said Com- 
municator. By this time three or 
four more natives had come up and 



16 



IF 




others were headed for the gather- 
ing. “Shortly you will understand 
all, and all will understand you. 
Throw it away!” 

“Throw it away!” chorused the 
other natives. 

“Well . .” said Jerry. Reluctant- 
ly, he took off the belt with the 
transceiver, and dropped it Com- 
municator gabbled unintelligibly. 

“. come with me . .” trans- 
lated the transceiver like a faint and 
tinny echo from the ground where 
it had landed. 

Communicator took hold of Jer- 
ry’s hand and drew him toward the 
nearest whitish structure. Jerry 
swallowed unobtrusively. It was one 
thing to make up his mind to do 
this; it was something else again to 
actually do it. But he let himself be 
led to and in through a crack in the 
structure. 

I nside, the place smelled rather like 
a mixture of a root cellar and a 
hayloft — earthy and fragrant at the 
same time. Communicator drew him 
in among the waist high tangle of 
roots rising and reentering the pack- 
ed earth floor. The other natives 
swarmed after them. Close to the 
center of the floor they reached a 
point where the roots were too thick 
to allow them to pick their way any 
further. The roots rose and tangled 
into a mat, the irregular surface of 
which was about three feet off the 
ground. Communicator patted the 
root surface and gabbled agreeably.' 

“You want me to get up there?” 
Jerry swallowed again, then gritted 
his teeth as the chained fury in him 
turned suddenly upon himself. There 



was nothing worse, he snarled at 
himself, than a man who was loag 
on planning a course of action* but 
short on carrying it out 

Awkwardly, he clambered up on 
to the matted surrace of the roots. 
They gave irregularly under him anil 
their rough surfaces scraped his 
knees and hands. The natives gab- 
bled, and he felt leather hands urg- 
ing him to stretch out and lie down 
on his back. 

He did so. The root scored and 
poked the tender skin of his back. 
It was exquisitely uncomfortable. 

“Now what — ?” he gasped. He 
turned his head to look at the na- 
tives and saw that green tendrils, 
growing rapidly from the root mass, 
were winding about and garlanding 
the arms and legs of Communica- 
tor and several other of the natives 
standing by. A sudden pricking at 
his left wrist made him look down. 

Green garlands were twining 
around his own wrists and ankles, 
sending wire-thin tendrils into his 
skin. In unconscious reflex of panic 
he tried to heave upward, but the 
green bonds held him fast. 

“Gabble-gabble-gabble . .” war- 
bled Communicator, reassuringly. 

With sudden alarm, Jerry realized 
that the green tendrils were grow- 
ing right into the arms and legs of 
the natives as well. He was abruptly 
conscious of further prickings in his 
own arms and legs. 

“What’s going on — ” he started 
to say. but found his tongue had 
gone unnaturally thick and unman- 
ageable. A wave of dizziness swept 
over him as if a powerful general 
anesthetic was taking hold. The in- 



TJGER GREEN 



17 




tenor of the structure seemed to 
darken; and he felt as if he was 
swooping away toward its ceiling on 
the long swing of some monster 
pendulum . 

It swung him on into darkness. 
And nightmare. 

I t was the same old nightmare, but 
more so. It was nightmare ex- 
perienced awake instead of asleep; 
and the difference was that he had 
no doubt about the fact that he was 
experiencing what he was experienc- 
ing, nor any tucked-away certainty 
that waking would bring him out of 
ft. 

Once more he floated through a 
changing soup of uncertainty, him- 
self a changing part of it. It was 
not painful, it was not even terrify- 
ing. But it was hideous — it was an 
affront to nature. He was not him- 
self. He was a thing, a part of the 
whole — and he must reconcile him- 
self to being so. He must accept it. 

Reconcile himself to it — no! It 
was not possible for the unbending, 
solitary, individualistic part that was 
him to do so. But accept it — may- 
be. 

Jerry set a jaw that was no longer 
a jaw and felt the determination in 
him to blast through, to comprehend 
this incomprehensible thing, become 
hard and undeniable as a sword- 
point of tungsten steel. He drove 
through — 

And abruptly the soup fell into 
order. It slid into focus like a blur- 
red scene before the gaze of a bad- 
ly ipyopic man who finally gets his 
spectacles before his eyes. Suddenly, 
Jerry was aware that what he ob- 



served was a scene not just before 
his eyes, but before his total aware- 
ness. And it was not the interior of 
the structure where he lay on a bed 
of roots, but the whole planet. 

It was a landscape of factories. 
Countless factories, interconnected, 
intersupplying, integrated. It lacked 
only that he find his own working 
place among them. 

Now, said this scene. This is the 
sane universe , the way it really is. 
Reconcile yourself to it. 

The hell 1 will! 

It was the furious unbending, soli- 
tary, individualistic part that was es- 
sentially him, speaking again. Not 
just speaking. Roaring — snarling 
its defiance, like a tiger on a hill- 
side. 

And the scene went — pop. 

Jerry opened his eyes. He sat up. 
The green shoots around and in his 
wrists and ankles pulled prickingly 
at him. But they were already dying 
and not able to hold him. He swung 
his legs over the edge of the mat 
of roots and stood down. Commun- 
icator and the others, who were 
standing there, backed fearfully 
away from him, gabbling. 

H e understood their gabbling no 
better than before, but now he 
could read the emotional overtones 
in it. And those overtones were now 
of horror and disgust, overlying a 
wild, atavistic panic and terror. He 
walked forward. They scuttled away 
before him, gabbling, and he walked 
through the nearest crack in the wall 
of the structure and out into the 
sunlight, toward the transceiver and 
the belt where he had dropped them. 



18 



IF 





“Monster!” screamed the trans- 
ceiver tinnily, faithfully translating 
the gabbling of the Communicator, 
who was following a few steps be- 
hind like a small dog barking be- 
hind a larger. “Brute! Savage! Un- 
clean . it kept up a steady de- 
nunciation. 

Jerry turned to face Communica- 
tor, and the native tensed for flight. 

“You know what I’m waiting 
for,” said Jerry, almost smiling, 
hearing the transceiver translate his 
words into gabbling — though it 
was not necessary. As he had said, 
Communicator knew what he was 
waiting for. 

Communicator cursed a little long- 
er in his own tongue, then went off 
into one of the structures, and re- 
turned with a handful of what look- 
ed like lengths of green vine. He 



dropped them on the ground before 
Jerry and backed away, cautiously, 
gabbling. 

“Now will you go? And never 
come back! Never . 

“We’ll see,” said Jerry. He picked 
up the lengths of green vine and 
turned away up the path to the ship. 

The natives he passed on his way 
out of the clearing huddled away 
from him and gabbled as he went. 

When he stepped back into the 
clearing before the ship, he saw that 
most of the vegetation touching or 
close to the ship was already brown 
and dying. He went on into the ship, 
carefully avoiding the locked sick- 
bay door, and wound lengths of the 
green vine around the wrists of each 
of the men in restraints. 

Then he sat down to await results. 
He had never been so tired in his 



TIGER GREEN 



19 



life. The minute he touched the 
chair, his eyes started to close. He 
struggled to his feet and forced him- 
self to pace the floor until the green 
vines, which had already sent hair- 
thin tendrils into the ulnar arteries 
of the arms around which they 
were wrapped, pumped certain in- 
hibitory chemicals into the blood- 
streams of the seven men. 

When the men started to blink 
their eyes and look about sensibly, 
he went to work to unfasten the 
homemade straitjackets that had 
held them prisoner. When he had 
released the last one, he managed 
to get out his final message before 
collapsing. 

*Take the ship up,” croaked 
Jerry. “Then, let yourself into the 
sickbay and wrap a vine piece 
around the wrists of Milt, and Art, 
and Ben. Ship up first — then when 
you’re safely in space, take care of 
them, in the sick bay. Do it the 
other way and you’ll never see 
Earth, again.” 

They crowded around him with 
questions. He waved them off, 
dumping into one of the abandoned 
bunks. 

**Ship up — ” he croaked. “Then 
release and fix the others. Ask me 
later. Later — ” 

. And that was all he remem- 
bered, then. 

V 

A t some indefinite time later, not 
quite sure whether he had wok- 
en by himself, or whether someone 
else had wakened him, Jerry swam 
back up to consciousness. He was 



vaguely aware that he had been 
sleeping a long time; and his body 
felt sane again, but weak as the body 
of a man after a long illness. 

He blinked and saw the laige 
face of Milt Johnson, partly obscur- 
ed by a cup of something. Milt was 
seated in a chair by the side of the 
bunk Jerry lay in, and the Team 
Captain was offering the cup of 
steaming black liquid to Jerry. Slow- 
ly. Jerry understood that this was 
coffee and he struggled up on one 
elbow to take the cup. 

He drank from it slowly for a 
little while, while Milt watched and 
waited. 

“Do you realize,” said Milt at 
last, when Jerry finally put down the 
three-quarters empty cup on the 
nightstand by the bunk, “that what 
you did in locking me in the sick 
bay was mutiny?” 

Jerry swallowed. Even his vocal 
chords seemed drained of strength 
and limp. 

“You realize,” he croaked, “what 
would have happened if I hadn’t?” 
“You took a chance. You follow- 
ed a wild hunch — ” 

“No hunch,” said Jerry. He clear- 
ed his throat. “Art found that 
growth on Wally’s brain had quit 
growing before Wally killed himself. 
And I’d been getting along without 
tranquilizers — handling the night- 
mares better than I had with them.” 
“It could have been the growth 
in your own brain,” said Milt, “tak- 
ing over and running you — work- 
ing better on you than it had on 
Wally.” 

“Working better — talk sense!” 
said Jerry, weakly, too pared down 



20 



IF 




by the past two weeks to care wheth- 
er school kept or not, in the matter 
of service courtesy to a superior. 
“The nightmares had broken Wally 
down to where we had to wrap him 
in a straitjacket. They hadn’t even 
knocked me off my feet. If Wally’s 
physiological processes had fought 
the alien invasion to a standstill, then 
I, you, Art, and Ben — all of us — 
had to be doing even, better. Be- 
sides — I’d figured out what the 
aliens were after.” 

“What were they after?” Milt 
looked strangely at him. 

“Curing us — of something we 
didn’t have when we landed, but 
they thought we had.” 

“And what was that?” 

“Insanity,” said Jerry, grimly. 

M ilt’s blond eyebrows went up. 

He opened his mouth as if to 
say something disbelieving — then 
closed it again. When he did speak, 
it was quite calmly and humbly. 

“They thought,” he asked, “Com- 
municator’s people thought that we 
were insane, and they could cure 
us?” 

Jerry laughed; not cheerfully, but 
grimly. 

“You saw that jungle around us 
back there?” he asked. “That was 
a factory complex — an infinitely 
complex factory complex. You saw 
their village with those tangles of 
roots inside the big whitish shells? 
— That was a highly diversified lab- 
oratory.” 

Milt’s blue eyes slowly widened, as 
Jerry watched. 

“You don’t mean that — serious- 
ly?” said Milt, at last. 



“That’s right.” Jerry drained the 
cup and set it aside. “Their technol- 
ogy is based on organic chemistry, 
the way ours is on the physical 
sciences. By our standards, they’re 
chemical wizards. How’d you like to 
try changing the mind of an alien 
organism by managing to grow j;i 
extra part on to his brain — the way 
they tried to do to us humans? To 
them, it was the simplest .way of 
convincing us.” 

Milt stared again. Finally, he 
shook his head. 

“Why?” he said. “Why would 
they want to change our minds?” 
“Because their philosophy, their 
picture of life and the universe 
around them grew out of a chemi- 
cally oriented science,” answered 
Jerry. “The result is, they see all life 
as part of a closed, intra-acting 
chemical circuit with no loose ends; 
with every living thing, intelligent 
or not, a part of the whole. Well, 
you saw it for yourself in your 
nightmare. That’s the cosmos as they 
see it — and to them it’s beautiful.” 
“But why did they want us to see 
it the way they did?” 

“Out of sheer kindness,” said Jerry 
and laughed barkingly. “Accordiag 
to their cosmology, there’s no such 
thing as an alien. Therefore we 
weren’t alien — just sick in the head. 
Poisoned by the lumps of metal like 
the ship and the translator, we 
claimed were so important. And our 
clothes and everything else we had. 
The kind thing was to cure and 
rescue us.” 

“Now, wait a minute,” said Milt. 
“They saw those things of ours 
work — ” 



TIGER GREEN

44*1 XThat’s the fact they worked 
W got to do with it? What you 
don't understand, Milt,” said Jerry, 
lying back gratefully on the bunk, 
that Communicator's peoples’ 
minds were closed . Not just uncon- 
vinced, not just refusing to see — 
but closed! Sealed, and welded shut 
from prehistoric beginnings right 
down to the present. The fact our 
translator worked meant nothin" to 
them. According to their cosmology, 
it shouldn’t work, so it didn't Any 
stray phenomena tending to prove 
it did were simply the product of 
diseased minds.” 

Jerry paused to emphasize the 
statement and his eyes drifted shut. 
The next thing he knew Milt was 
shaking him. 

“. Wake up!” Milt was shout- 
ing at him. “You can dope off after 
you’ve explained. I’m not going to 
have my crew back in strait jackets 
again, just because you were too 
sleepy to warn me they’d revert!” 

“. Won’t revert,” said Jerry, 
thickly. He roused himself. “Those 
lengths of vine released chemicals 
into their bloodstreams to destroy 
what was left of the growths. I 
wouldn't leave until I got them from 
Communicator.” Jerry struggled up 
on one elbow again. “And after a 
short walk in a human brain — 
mine — he and his people couldn't 
get us out of sight and forgotten 
fast enough.” 

“Why?” Milt shook him again as 
Jerry's eyelids sagged. “Why should 
getting their minds hooked in with 
yours shake them up so?” 

“. Bust — bust their cosmology 
open. Quit shaking . I’m awake.” 



“Why did it bust them wide op- 
en?” 

“Remember — how it was for you 
with the nightmares?” said Jerry. 
“The other way around? Think back, 
about when you slept. There you 
were, a lone atom of humanity, 
caught up in a nightmare like one 
piece of stew meat in a vat stew- 
ing all life together — just one single 
chemical bit with no independent 
existence, and no existence at all ex- 
cept as part of the whole. Remem- 
ber?” 

He saw Milt shiver slightly. 

“It was like being swallowed up 
by a soft machine,” said the Team 
Captain in a small voice. “I re- 
member.” 

“All right,” said Jerry. “That’s 
how it was for you in Communica- 
tor’s cosmos. But remember some- 
thing about that cosmos? It was 
warm, and safe. It was all-embrac- 
ing, aH-settling, like a great, big, 
soft, woolly comforter.” 

“It was too much like a woolly 
comforter,” said Milt, shuddering. 
“It was unbearable.” 

“To you. Right,” said Jerry. “But 
to Communicator, it was ideal. And 
if that was ideal, think what it was 
like when he had to step into a 
human mind — mine.” 

M ilt stared at him. 

“Why?” Mitt asked. 
“Because,” said Jerry. “He found 
himself alone there!” 

Milt’s eyes widened. 

“Think about it. Milt.” said Jer- 
ry. “From the time we’re born, we’re 
individuals. From the moment we 
open our eyes on the world, inside 



22 



IF 




we’re alone in the universe. All the 
emotional and intellectual resources 
that Communicator draws from his 
identity with the stewing vat of his 
cosmos, each one of us has to dig 
up for and out of himself!” 

Jerry stopped to give Milt a 
chance to say something. But Milt 
was evidently not in possession of 
something to say at the moment. 

“That’s why Communicator and 
the others couldn’t take it, when 
they hooked into my human mind,” 
Jerry went on. “And that’s why, 
when they found out what we were 
like inside, they couldn’t wait to get 
rid of us. So they gave me the vines 
and kicked us out. That’s the whole 
•tory.” He lay back on the bunk. 
Milt cleared his throat. 

“All right,” he said. 

Jerry’s heavy eyes closed. Then 
the other man’s voice spoke, still 
close by his ear. 

“But,” said Milt, “I still think you 
took a chance, going down to butt 
heads with the natives that way. 
What if Communicator and the rest 
had been able to stand exposure to 
your mind. You’d locked me in and 
the other men were in restraint. Our 
whole team would have been part 
of that stewing vat.” 

“Not a chance,” said Jerry. 

“You can’t be sure of that.” 

“Yes I can.” Jerry heard his own 
voice sounding harshly beyond the 
darkness of his closed eyelids. “It 



wasn’t just that I knew my cosmo 
logical view was too tough for them. 
It was the fact that their minds wen 
closed — in the vat they had M 
freedom to change and adapt them- 
selves to anything new.” 

“What’s that got to do with it?” 
demanded the voice of Milt. 

“Everything,” said Jerry. “Their 
point of view only made us very 
uncomfortable — but our point of 
view, being individually' adaptable, 
and open, threatened to destroy the 
very laws of existence as they saw 
them. An open mind can always 
stand a closed one, if it has to — by 
making room for it in the general 
picture. But a closed mind can’t 
stand it near an open one without 
risking immediate and complete de- 
struction in its own terms. In a clos- 
ed mind, there’s no more room.” 

He stopped speaking and slowly 
exhaled a weary breath. 

“Now,” he said, without opening 
his eyes, “will you finally get oot 
of here and let me sleep?” 

For a long second more, there 
was silence. Then, he heard a chair 
scrape softly, and the muted steps 
of Milt tiptoeing away. 

With another sigh, at last Jerry re- 
laxed and let consciousness slip from 
him. 

He slept. 

— As sleep the boar upon the 
plain, the hawk upon the crag, and 
the tiger on the hill . END

TIME OF WAR 

by MACK REYNOLDS 



In the battle for the world, one 
life more or less meant nothing 
— except to the man who took itJ 



T here was a light flashing red. 

Alex hit the release button with 
the heel of his hand, flicked his eyes 
to the dial in question. 

Animal heat. 

He dropped both the speed and 
altitude levers, banked steeply and 
dove. His eyes went to the screen, 
he reached up and increased magni- 
fication ten fold. His fingers danced 
over buttons, searching out the ap- 
propriate chart. It flashed onto the 
map-screen. 

Damn. The beetle was above that 
poorly mapped, all but unknown 
Balkan area where the Thrace of 
Greece and the Macedonia of Yugo- 
slavia, met Bulgaria. The nearest 
cities of any size would have been 
Yugoslavian Skopje, Greek Salon- 
ika, Bulgarian Plovdiv, but he was 
far from the ruins of any of them. 

As the ground came up, his eyes 
shot to the dial again. Quite a bit 
of animal heat. Probably a man. 



A man in this area? Alex pursed 
his lips. Possible, but not probable. 

He was less than two miles in 
altitude, now. He increased magni- 
fication again. The vicinity was high- 
ly wooded. 

He adjusted his metallic sensors, 
fossil fuel sensors, nuclear power 
sensors. For all he knew, this was 
a Comic trap and they were trying 
to suck his beetle in. Seemed un- 
likely, though. He hadn’t spotted a 
Comic in this area for a goodly time. 

When he was within a mile of 
the surface, he cut propulsion com- 
pletely and hovered. His eyes went 
back to the chart and he enlarged 
it to ultimate. It still didn’t give him 
much. The area had been fought 
over, ravaged, destroyed and rebuilt 
since the days of Philip and Alex- 
ander but it had never really been 
charted in the modern sense. There 
were the remains of a small farm- 
ing town to the south; however, he 



24 




couldn't make out if it might be 
Rodopolis in what had once been 
Greece, or Novo Selo in Macedonia. 

H e scowled at the dial. There was 
more heat radiation than was 
called for by one person. Perhaps 
there were two or three. It was pos- 
sible, no matter how unlikely. The 
human animal is gregarious; given 
any opportunity at all he will seek 
out his fellows, even though it might 
increase his chances of destruction. 

He flicked his eyes over to the 
cocking handles of the minirockets, 
though he knew he had checked 
them out before take-off. Given 
life below, Alex was in a position to 
start snuffing it out like candles. 

The trouble was, exactly where 
was he, over Comic territory or their 
own? 

He had made that mistake with 
the fishing boat, off the coast of 
Cuba. He had thought, of course, 
that the two terrified occupants had 
been enemy civilians. It had been 
sickening to find his mistake later. 

He zeroed-in on the source of 
body heat, brought the beetle up to 
a slow, careful speed. It might still 
be a Comic trap, but he could find 
no signs of the presence of mech- 
anical equipment in the vicinity. He 
dropped lower, tense now. He was 
getting awfully close. He kept his 
right hand very near the trigger of 
one of the minirockets. 

Suppose it was some peasant, mi- 
raculously saved from the holocaust. 
How was he to know, in this area, 
if the man was Greek, Macedonian 
or Bulgar? As he recalled, the na- 
tionalities blended iixto each other 



at this point to such a degree that 
even borders made precious little 
difference. 

All of a sudden, he brought the 
beetle to a halt and began to chuck- 
le. There in a small meadow, clear- 
ing would be the better term, brows- 
ed a woebegone cow. 

It had been a long time , since he 
had seen a cow. Alex looked at it 
for a long moment, ruefully. In his 
youth, he had spent some time on a 
farm and had loved every minute. It 
had been fate that had put him into 
an educational bracket which had 
wound him up as the pilot of a 
beetle. 

He shook his head, even as he 
reached for the altitude lever. Had 
he become a farmer, he would now, 
without question, have been dead. 
And even though family, relatives, 
friends, sweetheart were now all past 
away, life is to be lived. 

He shot into patrol pattern again, 
resetting his sensors. His Chronom- 
eter told him that he had only a few 
more moments to go. 

When his time had elapsed, he put 
the beetle into orbit, threw the auto- 
matic control switch, then stood up, 
yawning. He stretched greatly, then 
massaged the back of his neck. Hn 
had a tendency to tighten up when 
on patrol. 

Alex turned and threw the cogs 
on the metal door behind him. He 
stepped into the corridor beyond and 
headed for the executive officer's 
office. 

Nick was on the desk. He said, 
“How did it go?” 

Alex yawned again. “Nothing. I 
begin to suspect that there’s nobody 



TIMf OF WAR 



2S 




left at all in my area. The fallout 
must have got those that survived.” 
Nick grunted. “The Comics would 
like it, if they knew we thought so. 
Don’t underestimate the human an- 
imal, Alex. He survives under some 
of the most impossible circumstan- 
ces. Peter ran into a whole island 
of Eskimo in the northern Pacific.” 
Alex was surprised. “What did he 
do?” 

“Blasted them, of course. They 
were Comics.” 

Alex wondered, inwardly. Eskimo. 
Possibly they didn’t have the vaguest 
knowledge of the war, nor why it 
was they were being killed. But 
Nick was right. Man had a fan- 
tastic ability to survive. 

N ick said, “You left your beetle 
in orbit?” 

‘That’s right,” Alex said wearily. 
“It isn’t due for a check-out yet.” 
He turned to go, but then recalled 
the animal he had seen. 

He said, “You know what I saw 
today? A cow. I thought I was get- 
ting a heat indication of at least 
one man, but it was a cow. Wonder 
how it ever survived.” 

Nick said, “The last time I was 
on patrol, I saw four deer.” 

“Oh? What did you do?” 

“What could I do? I was over 
Comic territory. I blasted them.” 
“Blasted them! Well, whyT Alex 
felt a sinking sensation. With so 
precious little major life left at all 
on Earth, who could wish to butcher 
4eer? 

Nick was irritated. “I told you. 
It was Comic territory. Had there 
been any human life hiding out, sur- 



viving somehow or other, the deer 
would have been potential food. I 
killed them. In the same way as if 
you saw a house standing, you’d 
blast it, so that it couldn’t be used 
for shelter.” He hesitated for a mo- 
ment, then said, “Was she being 
milked?” 

The other’s mind had been on the 
deer. He said, “How do you mean?” 
“The cow. Was she being 
milked?” 

“How would I know?” 

“The udder, you ninny. If it was 
fuH, she was being milked, which 
would mean, in turn, that there’s 
somebody doing the milking.” 

“I didn’t get any indication of 
further animal heat.” 

“Could be in some sort of dugout. 
It’s surprising how quickly some of 
the survivors have adapted to pro- 
tecting themselves against us. Not 
that they’re any smarter than our 
people. They’ve worked out a dozen 
ways of perserving themselves 
against those buzz-fighters the Com- 
ics use.” 

Alex grunted. He had long been 
of the opinion that the higher-ups 
would do better to spend more ef- 
fort protecting their civilians who 
had survived, rather than continuing 
to seek out the pitiful remnant of 
the Comics who were still alive. 
However, he didn’t say anything. 
Nick had a mono-rail mind, when it 
came to official position. Anything 
the brass decided was gospel to 
Nick. 

Alex said, “I’ll take another look 
at the cow, tomorrow, if I can find 
it again. Even if it is being milked. 
Pm not sure it’s in what was for- 



16 



IF 




merly our own territory, of theirs.” 
Nick said, “Well, you know what 
the general said, when in doubt.” 
Alex repressed a shudder, as he 
headed back for his sleeping quar- 
ters. The general had never jock- 
eyed a beetle in his life. Had never 
had to blast a noncombatant. Per- 
haps he wouldn’t be quite so devout 
a retaliationist, had he to follow his 
own orders. 

I n the morning, going by the twen- 
ty-four hour Earth Clock, Alex 
came awake slowly. There had been 
a time, when he had been an am- 
bitious young officer, that he had 
tried to discipline himself away from 
this practice. Now he had given up. 
In truth, the half hour or so that 
he allowed to lapse between first 
stirrings of consciousness and full 
awakening was the happiest of his 
day. Happiest wasn’t quite the word. 
There was no such reality as happi- 
ness in the life now led. But at least 
his semi -dream state was the most 
nearly satisfying. 

In half control of his dream- 
thinking, he could steer his thoughts 
in what direction he would. Back 
over yesteryear when there had been 
ambitions, appetites, goals. When 
there had been arts to appreciate, 
crafts to study, entertainments to 
enjoy. 

There had been Anna to love. 
And what was Anna now? A cinder. 
If not a cinder, a terrified, under- 
fed, under-clothed, under-sheltered 
fugitive from the Comic buzz-fight- 
ers who patrolled, even as Alex 
patrolled, seeking out the last rem- 
nants of life. 



He had allowed his thoughts to 
go where he would rather they not 
stray. He came fully awake and 
swung his legs out over the edge of 
the bunk. 

He went through the usual rou- 
tine of getting cleaned up and 
dressed, the never ending sameness 
of it all, and made his way to the 
mess. 

As he ate the food of the hydro- 
ponic beds, the yeast cellars, he 
scanned the freshly printed day’s 
bulletin. 

An inspiration editorial by the 
general. The day would soon come 
when, the Comics utterly defeated, 
the personnel of moon-base would 
return to Earth and begin the task 
of reconstruction. 

Alex grunted. He sometimes sus- 
pected that the general had fed his 
ideas into one of the typer-comput- 
ors with standing orders that for 
each issue of the bulletin a new ed- 
itorial be turned out, saying the 
same thing over and over again in 
a slightly altered version. 

The fact was, that there was pre- 
cious little chance that the Comics 
would ever be utterly defeated. 
Their super-Sputnik, as the junior 
officers had dubbed it, was as im- 
pregnable to attack as was the 
moon-base. And this truth had long 
since been accepted. The efforts to 
eliminate their mutual bases had 
been so costly that neither side any 
longer attempted it. Such fighting as 
took place between them, were the 
rare meetings above the surface of 
Earth, when beetle met buzz-fighter, 
usually through inadvertence, and 
fought it out. 



TIME Of WAX 



27 




If the truth were known, the gen- 
eral didn’t even encourage that. The 
two fighting craft were so equally 
matched that one side’s losses bal- 
anced the other’s, and they were 
running short on the beetles they 
needed to prosecute the retaliation. 

Which brought him to another 
item in the bulletin. A sneak landing 
had been made hurriedly in the an- 
tarctic and a sizeable amount of 
supplies loaded upon one of the 
freighter-craft. The supplies had 
been left over from the days when 
the nations had in considerable co- 
operation been exploring that re- 
mote continent. 

Alex grunted. So that’s where so 
many of the beetles had been, pro- 
tecting the scavenging raid. It was 
a minor victory. In fact, more than 
balanced by the Comic Raid earlier 
when they had dispatched an equi- 
valent space freighter to one of the 
Pacific islands where they had man- 
aged to locate a supply of fuel. 

H e wondered at the need of sec- 
recy here on the moon-base. 
It was hard to believe that any 
Comic agents might be among them. 
And even if there was, how in the 
world could such an agent ever get 
a message to the enemy? No, Alex 
suspected that their rigid security 
measures were nonsense, left-over 
methods of an earlier period. The 
military mind was slow to change, 
even in the age of space war. 

And here was the story of Peter’s 
successful attack upon the Eskimo. 
Evidently there had been at least 
a score of them. Alex shook his 
head. How could it possibly have 



been known that they were from 
Comic territory, originally? The 
Eskimo were nomadic. Food supply, 
such as it was, would dictate that 
they move as much as a hundred 
miles in a week. 

It was the same problem he had 
faced on the patrol yesterday. 

Even had he spotted a survivor 
of the world debacle, how could he 
know whether the person was orig- 
inally a resident of Comic territory? 
In desperate search of food and 
shelter, and protection from the 
ruthless attacks of beetles and buzz- 
fighters, such a refugee might travel 
many a mile from nis place of or- 
igin. 

The speaker called his name. 

He was to report for immediate 
patrol. 

That was only mildly surprising. 
The men who had covered the ant- 
arctic sneak landing had probably 
been on duty for long hours beyond 
the usual. They would need rest 
He was comparatively fresh. 

He came to his feet, adjusted his 
tunic on the off chance that he 
might meet one of the brass hats hi 
the corridors and be dressed down 
for sloppy appearance, and started 
for the cubicle which he usually oc- 
cupied when piloting a remote-con- 
trol beetle. 

At this hour he met only one 
other person. One of the women 
scientists. He saluted heir, as reg- 
ulations called for, but she ignored 
him and bustled on. 

It came to Alex, sourly, even as 
he continued, that this horse-faced, 
cow-figured specimen was probably 
one of the few remaining females 



26 



IF 




of his species who might survive to 
•help replenish the Earth. If any at 
all survived. Briefly, he wondered 
if the high-ups had decided upon a 
program of breeding. If they had, it 
should best get underway even whilst 
they were still here on Luna. Most 
of these women scientists were by t 
no means youngsters. Some must 
already be past the menopause. 

He reached the executive officer’s 
preserve, reported, got his assign- 
ment, which was identical to yester- 
day’s, saluted, and continued to his 
cubicle. He wondered how many 
beetles were out today. He hadn’t 
seen any of the other fellows in the 
corridors, or in the mess. Probably 
everybody who could be spared was 
on patrol. The Comics were prob- 
ably in a tizzy over the Antarctic 
raid, and would be speeding up their 
retaliation. 

He hung his jacket up and seated 
himself at the control chair, before 
the screens, the panels, the dials, 
switches, triggers, gauges and all 
the rest of it. And even as he went 
through the standard routine of tak- 
ing over the beetle, now in fast or- 
bit, his memory went back to the 
long studies that had been involved 
in learning this business of elimin- 
ating every unit of human life in 
the lands of the enemy. At the time 
of his training, he had never ex- 
pected it to ever come to this. But, 
then, he doubted if anyone else had, 
either. 

At the very last, he threw the 
cocking handles of the mini-rockets, 
threw off the automatic control, and 
accepted the piloting of the vicious 
little beetle. 



I t was a full hour later, an hour 
of carefully scanning over a 
large area of southern Europe, when 
he came to the vicinity where he had 
spotted the cow the day before. 

He had little doubt that he could 
find the animal again. And yes, 
there it was The indicator flashed 
animal heat. 

He increased the magnification of 
his viewing screen, and sent the 
beetle darting toward the little 
meadow the cow had been grazing 
in the day before. 

For the moment, engrossed in his 
object, he had failed to keep a con- 
stant eye on his other screens and 
scanning devices. Thus it was that 
his first warning of attack was a 
flashing ball of fire which, he real- 
ized, must have missed the miniature 
craft he was piloting from afar, by 
a scant half mile. 

Automatically he upped the 
speed lever, and pulled the direc- 
tional stick backward, slamming for 
altitude. He banged open all screens, 
darted his head around, seeking the 
source of the attack. The unclear 
power sensor was flashing green 
warning, the alarm siren was whin- 
ing. Impatiently, he brushed them 
both to inoperation. He decreased 
magnification on all screens, des- 
perately seeking the foe over the 
broadcast area, even as he took 
standard evasive action. 

Wherever and whoever his enemy, 
the Comic wasn’t the man he might 
be. Alex’s beetle should have been 
crisped by now. As it was, he 
hadn’t even been nicked. 

And, yes, there it was! A one man 
buzz-fighter, of course. 



TIME OF WAR 



29 




It was their one big advantage 
ever the Comics. The enemy craft 
contained a living pilot who died in 
defeat. The beetles, piloted remote- 
ly from the moon-base, could be de- 
■troyed surely enough, but it was 
impossible for a pilot to be lost. 
War in air and space had come a 
long way since the Fokkers and 
Spads of World War One fought it 
out over the Western Front. 

The buzz-fighters, comparatively 
large and cumbersome, must needs 
come down from their artificial sat- 
ellite base before taking over their 
retaliation patrols. It was a time 
consuming, man consuming matter 
and Alex had a secret admiration 
for the stamina involved. 

Even as they began their jockey- 
ing of death, roaring about the sky 
in great screaming of agonized ma- 
chinery, great roaring of rockets and 
jets, he realized that the other must 
have spotted Alex’s beetle toward 
the end of a patrol, and compar- 
atively was physically exhausted. 

Only that would account for the 
fact that the foe’s reactions were ob- 
viously slow. Ordinarily, a buzz- 
fighter gave as much as it took. 
Indeed, it had some advantages over 
the tiny beetle. For one thing, it 
mounted a heavier firepower, a 
greater supply of bolts. The beetle’s 
sole armament were the two mini- 
rockets, nuclear charged and capable 
of blasting a fairly good-sized town. 
Alex didn’t know how many bolts 
the buzz-fighter boasted, but he 
knew it was considerably more than 
two. 

He dropped sharply in a feint, 
came up roaring from below. 



He had blisters of cold sweat on 
his forehead, could feel his shirt 
sticking to his back. He inevitably 
perspired in action. Safe, hundreds 
of thousands of miles away from 
the combat he might be, but in ac- 
tion you largely forgot that. Not 
completely though. At least in your 
subconscious you knew you were 
untouchable. But how about that 
enemy pilot? If his craft took a 
bolt, then all was over. At most, 
Alex would get a reprimand for be- 
ing inept. 

F or the briefest of split seconds, 
the buzz-fighter was in his 
sighter screen, past the cross hairs, 
but in it. He slashed his fist out at 
the trigger button and his screen 
blurred momentarily as the beetle’s 
weight dropped suddenly with the 
release of the mini-rocket. 

Then there was glare! 

A near hit? Had the missile’s sen- 
sors caught enough of the enemy’s 
heat to detonate? 

Or was it another fluke blast? 
The mini-rockets Armament was 
turning out these days weren’t up to 
original standards. Which wasn't 
surprising in view of the improvis- 
ing they had to do, what with lim- 
ited materials. 

He came around in a roar — a roar 
tens upon tens of thousands of miles 
from his ear — and banged the 
screens to increased magnification. 
And stared. 

He had never seen before a buzz- 
fighter merely crippled. On all oth- 
er occasions when he had come 
against the enemy fighters, they had 
flared up like magnesium upon being 



30 



IF 




hit. Flared up from the atomic at- 
tack in such wise that there could 
be no question of survival on the 
part of the Comic pilot. 

But now this one was fluttering 
to earth, like a wounded air-borne 
bird. 

He kicked controls around and 
headed for it. 

He had a double problem. He had 
exactly one mini-rocket left and 
couldn’t waste it. The enemy pilot 
must be destroyed beyond any 
doubt. There were a limited number 
of Comic pilots left, and each one 
departed hastened the day when the 
war could be considered over and 
the general’s oft proclaimed return 
to earth became a reality. 

But there was also the chance 
that the enemy was still in condi- 
tion to mount a counter-attack on 
his diminutive enemy. Alex had 
no way of knowing whether or not 
the other was still conscious, but he 
must assume that he was. The buzz- 
fighter had caught only the edge 
of the mini-rocket blast, and had evi- 
dently had delicate equipment so 
smashed that it was no longer fully 
operative. 

He came in with care. With so 
much care, that the buzz-fighter 
managed to sink to a landing, by 
coincidence, in the same meadow in 
which Alex had spotted the cow the 
previous day. 

He banked around quickly, and 
dropped the beetle's speed. Perhaps 
the other was dead. In which case, 
the thing was to make every effort 
to get a full size combat unit down 
here with a freighter-craft and try 
to capture the buzz-fighter intact, 



before the lads on the super-Sputnik 
caught on and fired a real flatter- 
er to blast this whole section of the 
Balkans. The technicians and scien- 
tists there at moon-base had never 
had the opportunity to take apart a 
buzz-fighter. Given such a chance, 
it might lead to some discovery 
that would make a decisive differ- 
ence in the prosecuting of the. war. 

B ut no. Even as he maneuvered 
his diminutive fighter into the 
clearing, a figure broke from the 
side of the enemy craft and dashed 
for the woods. At the same split 
second, the buzz-fighter began to 
glow in heat, and rapidly crumbled 
into a mass of flaming nothingness. 

The Comic had sabotaged his 
craft. Alex swore, but his obscenit- 
ies broke off in the middle. 

The other was garbed in shorts 
and halter, and blonde hair was 
streaming behind even as she ran for 
what little protection the trees might 
offer. 

Meaninglessly, as he darted his 
beetle after her, the thought came 
to his mind, was the briefness of 
clothing due to heat in the buzz- 
fighter, or was it a matter of saving 
weight? 

There was something strangely fa- 
miliar in her desperate flight, and 
then it came to hinj. She ran as 
Anna ran. As Anna had once run. 
Her figure, too, was Anna’s. Youth- 
ful, firm, but all rounded woman. 
This enemy pilot could be no more 
than in her mid-twenties. 

He had heard that the Comics 
used women as well as men in the 
war in space and air, but he had

secretly thought it propaganda, as 
he thought most of the atrocity stor- 
ies. Evidently, it was true enough. 
Comic manpower was evidently as 
short as his own side’s. 

She was nearly to the edge of the 
clearing, running desperately hard, 
her firm, shapely legs pumping. 

She must have known, as he so 
well knew, that her flight was mean- 
ingless. A bolt from his beetle would 
blast everything in an area the 
diameter of a mile, reducing it to 
nothing. But life is so much to be 
lived, even the last ultimate minute. 

Suddenly he pulled back the con- 
trol stick and, pointing the beetle 
skyward, hit at the same moment 
both the remaining mini-rocket 
trigger and the speed lever. The bolt 
went arching off into the depths of 
space, and the beetle headed home. 

He threw it into automatic and 
came to his feet, rubbing the back 
of his neck as hard as he could press 
fingers into the flesh. 

He went out into the corridor and 
headed toward the exec’s office. 
Nick was on the desk, as he had 
been the day before. 

Nick looked up. “Thought you 
were on patrol over the Balkans.” 
“I was. I fired both my bolts. 
I’ve got the beetle on automatic 
coming in for fresh mini-rockets.” 
Nick looked at him. ‘Two bolts 
to finish off a cow?” 

“A buzz-fighter jumped me, while 
I was going in to blast the animal. 
I managed to hit it.” 

Nick was immediately doubly 
alert. “Wonderful!” He reached for 
a report pad. “Absolutely sure of 
destruction?” 



“Yes,” Alex said. “It burnt to a 
crisp.” ^ 

“Wonderful!” Nick crowed, writ- 
ing rapidly. “You’ll get another ci- 
tation.” 

Alex said wearily, “I feel pooped, 
I think I’ll take a nap.” 

Before he turned to leave, Alex 
said slowly, “Nick, why do we call 
them Comics?” 

C i TT' h?” The other continued writ- 
-C--' ing the report. 

‘The enemy, over in that super- 
Sputnik of theirs, the artifical sat- 
ellite.” 

Nick thought about it, finally 
shrugged his shoulders. “I don't 
know. I suppose it’s derived from 
the fact that in the old days we used 
to ridicule them by saying their 
young people, their students, spent 
more time reading cartoon books, 
comic books, you know, than they 
did studying the sciences.” 

“Oh,” Alex mused. “I wonder 
what they call us.” 

Nick said stiffly, “I would hardly 
know, but probably something un- 
worthy of our admitted idealistic 
goals.” 

Alex made his way to his quar- 
ters and slumped down on his bed. 
His face worked as he stared up at 
the ceiling. Somehow, he thought 
that she would survive. The cow 
was there. 

Lieutenant Alex Moiseyevich 
Menzhinsky knew he was a traitor. 
The thing was — she ran so very 
much like Anna had run, back 
when there was an Anna, back 
when they’d both been youngsters 
on the collective. END

MASQUE 

OF THE 

RED SHIFT 

by FRED SABERHAGEN 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



Outside the ship the Berserkers 
roamed a ruined galaxy. Inside 
the revelers jeered at Death I 



I 

F inding himself alone and unoc- 
cupied, Felipe Nogara chose to 
spend a free moment in looking at 
the thing that had brought him out 
here beyond the last fringe of the 
galaxy. From the luxury of his quar- 
ters he stepped up into his private 



observation bubble. There, in a 
raised dome of invisible glass, he 
seemed to be standing outside the 
hull of his flagship Nirvana . 

Under that hull, “below” the Nir- 
vana’s artificial gravity, there slant- 
ed the bright disk of the galaxy, in- 
cluding in one of its arms all the 
star-systems that Earth-descended 



33 





man had yet explored. But in what- 
ever direction Nogara looked, bright 
spots and points of light were plenti- 
ful. They were other galaxies, 
marching away at their recessional 
velocities of tens of thousands of 
miles per second, marching on out 
to the optical horizon of the uni- 
verse. 

Nogara had not come here to 
look at galaxies, however; he had 
come to look at something new, at 
a phenomenon never before seen by 
men at such close range. 

It was made visible to him by the 
apparant pinching-together of the 
galaxies beyond it, and by the clouds 
and streamers of dust cascading in- 
to it. The star that formed the cen- 
ter of the phenomenon was itself 
held beyond human sight by the 
strength of its own gravity. Its mass, 
perhaps a billion times that of Sol, 
so bent spacetime around itself that 
not a photon of light could escape 
it with a visible wavelength. 

The dusty debris of deep space 
tumbled and churned, falling into 
the grip of the hypermass. The fall- 
ing dust built up static charges until 
lightning turned it into luminescent 
thunderclouds, and the flicker of the 
vast lightning shifted into the red 
before it vanished, near the bottom 
of the gravitational hill. Probably 
not even a neutrino could escape 
this sun. And no ship would dare 
approach much closer than Nirvana 
now rode. 

N ogara had come out here to 
judge for himself if the recent- 
ly discovered phenomenon might 
soon present any danger to inhab- 



ited planets; ordinary suns would 
go down like chips of wood into a 
whirlpool if the hypermass found 
them in its path. But it seemed that 
another thousand years would pass 
before any planets had to be evac- 
uated; and before then the hyper- 
mass might have gorged itself on 
dust until its core imploded, where- 
upon most of its substance could be 
expected to re-enter the universe in 
a most spectacular but less danger- 
ous form. 

Anyway, in another thousand 
years it would be someone else’s 
problem. Right now it might be 
said to be Nogara* s — for men said 
that he ran the galaxy, if they said 
it of anyone. 

A communicator sounded, calling 
him back to the enclosed luxury of 
his quarters, and he walked down 
quickly, glad of a reason to get out 
from under the galaxies. 

He touched a plate with one 
strong and hairy hand. “What is it?** 

“My lord, a courier ship has ar- 
rived. From the Flamland system. 
They are bringing . .” 

“Speak plainly. They are bring- 
ing my brother’s body?” 

“Yes, my lord. The launch bear- 
ing the coffin is already approach- 
ing Nirvana .” 

“I will meet the courier captain, 
alone, in the Great Hall. I want no 
ceremony. Have the robots at the 
airlock test the escort and the out- 
side of the coffin for infection.” 

“Yes, my lord.” 

The mention of disease was a bit 
of misdirection. It was not the 
Flamland plague that had put No- 
gara's half-brother Johann Karlsen 



34 



IF 




into a box, though that was the of- 
ficial story. The doctors were sup- 
posed to have frozen the hero of 
the Stone Place as a last resort, to 
prevent his irreversible death. 

An official lie was necessary be- 
cause not even High Lord Nogara 
could lightly put out of the way the 
one man who had made the differ- 
ence at the Stone Place nebula. In 
that battle seven years ago the ber- 
serker machines had been beaten; 
if they had not been, intelligent life 
might already be extinct in the 
known galaxy. The berserkers were 
huge automated warships, built for 
some conflict between long-vanished 
races and now the enemies of every- 
thing that lived. The fighting against 
them was still bitter, but since the 
Stone Place it seemed that life in 
the galaxy would survive. 

The Great Hall was where No- 
gara met daily for feasting and 
pleasure with the forty or fifty 
people who were with him on Nir- 
vana, as aides or crewmen or enter- 
tainers. But when he entered the 
Hall now he found it empty, save 
for one man who stood at atten- 
tion beside a coffin. 

Johann Karlsen’s body and what- 
ever remained of his life were sealed 
under the glass top of the heavy 
casket, which contained its own re- 
frigeration and revival systems, con- 
trolled by a fiber-optic key theoret- 
ically impossible to duplicate. This 
key Nogara now demanded, with a 
gesture, from the courier captain. 

T he captain had the key hung 
round his neck, and it took him 
a moment to pull the golden chain 



over his head and hand it to No- 
gara. It was another moment before 
he remembered to bow; he was a 
spaceman and not a courtier. No- 
gara ignored the lapse of coiirtesy. 
It was his governors and admirals 
who were re-instituting ceremonies 
of rank; he himself cared nothing 
about how subordinates gestured and 
postured, so long as they obeyed in- 
telligently. 

Only now, with the key in his own 
hand, did Nogara look down at his 
frozen half-brother. The plotting 
doctors had shaved away Johann’s 
short beard, and his hair. His lips 
were marble pale, and his sightless 
open eyes were ice. But still the 
face above the folds of the draped 
and frozen sheet was undoubtedly 
Johann’s. There was something that 
would not freeze. 

“Leave me for a time,” Nogara 
said. He turned to face the end of 
the Great Hall and waited, looking 
out through the wide viewpoint to 
where the hypermass blurred space 
like a bad lens. 

When he heard the door ease shut 
behind the courier captain he turned 
back — and found himself facing the 
short figure of Oliver Mical, the man 
he had selected to replace Johann 
as governor on Flamland. Mical 
must have entered as the spaceman 
left, which Nogara thought might 
be taken as symbolic of something. 
Resting his hands familiarly on the 
coffin, Mical raised one graying eye- 
brow in his habitual expression of 
weary amusement. His rather puffy 
face twitched in an overcivilized 
smile. 

“How does Browning’s line go?” 



36 



IF 




Mical mused, glancing down at 
Kaijlsen. “ ‘Doing the king’s work 
all the dim day long’ — and now, this 
reward of virtue.” 

“Leave me,” said Nogara. 

Mical was in on the plot, as was 
hardly anyone else except the Flam- 
land doctors. “I thought it best to 
appear to share your grief,” he said. 
Then he looked at Nogara and 
ceased to argue. He made a bow that 
was mild mockery when the two of 
them were alone, and walked brisk- 
ly to the door. Again it closed. 

So, Johann. If you had plotted 
against me, I would have had you 
killed outright. But you were never 
a plotter, it was just that you served 
me too successfully, my enemies and 
friends alike began to love you too 
well. So here you are, my frozen 
conscience, the last conscience I'll 
ever have. Sooner or later you would 
have become ambitious, so it was 
either do this to you or kill you. 

Now I’ll put you away safely, and 
maybe someday you’ll have another 
chance at life. It’s a strange thought 
that someday you may stand musing 
over my coffin as I now stand over 
yours. No doubt you’ll pray for 
what you think is my soul ... I 
can’t do that for you, but I wish 
you sweet dreams. Dream of your 
Believers’ heaven, not of your hell.” 

Nogara imagined a brain at ab- 
solute zero, its neurons super-con- 
ducting, repeating one dream on and 
on and on. But that was nonsense. 

“I cannot risk my power, Jo- 
hann.” This time he whispered the 
words aloud. “It was either this or 
have you killed.” He turned again 
to the wide viewport. 



n 

C cT suppose Thirty-three’s gotten 
A the body to Nogara already,” 
said the Second Officer of Esteeler 
Courier Thirty-four, looking at the 
bridge chronometer. “It must be 
nice to declare yourself an emper- 
or or whatever, and have people hurl 
themselves all over the galaxy to do 
everything for you.” 

“Can’t be nice to have someone 
bring you your brother’s corpse,” 
said Captain Thurman Holt, study- 
ing his astrogational sphere. His 
ship’s C-plus drive was rapidly 
stretching a lot of time-like interval 
between itself and the Flamland 
system. Even if Holt was not en- 
thusiastic about his mission, he was 
glad to be away from Flamland, 
where Mical’s political police were 
taking over. 

“I wonder,” said the Second, and 
chuckled. 

“What’s that mean?” 

The Second looked over both 
shoulders, out of habit formed on 
Flamland. “Have you heard this 
one?” he asked. “Nogara is God — 
but half of his spacemen are ath- 
eists.” 

Holt smiled, but only faintly. 
“He’s no mad tyrant, you know. 
Esteel’s not the worst-run govern- 
ment in the galaxy. Nice guys don’t 
put down rebellions.” 

“Karlsen did all right.” 

“That’s right, he did.” 

The Second grimaced. “Oh sure, 
Nogara could be worse, if vou want 
to be serious about it. He’s a pol- 
itician. But I just can’t stand that 
crew that’s accumulated around him 



MASQUE OF THE RED SHIFT 



37 




the last few years. We’ve got an ex- 
ample on board now of what they 
do. If you want to know the truth 
I’m a little scared now that Karlsen’s 
dead.” 

“Well, we’ll soon see them.” Holt 
sighed, and stretched. “I’m going to 
look in on the prisoners. The bridge 
is yours, Second.” 

“I relieve you, sir. Do the man 
a favor and kill him, Thurm.” 

A minute later, looking through 
the spy-plate into the courier’s small 
brig, Holt could wish with honest 
compassion that his male prisoner 
was dead. 

He was an outlaw chieftain named 
Janda, and his capture had been the 
last success of Karlsen’s Flamland 
service, putting a virtual end to the 
rebellion. Janda had been a tall 
man, a brave rebel, and a brutal 
bandit. He had raided and fought 
against Nogara’s Esteeler empire un- 
til there was no hope left, and then 
he had surrendered to Karlsen. 

“My pride commands me to con- 
quer my enemy,” Karlsen had writ- 
ten once, in what he thought was to 
be a private letter. “My honor for- 
bids me to humble or hate my en- 
emy.” But Mical’s political police 
operated with a different philos- 
ophy. 

T he outlaw might still be long- 
boned, but Holt had never seen 
him stand tall. The manacles still 
binding his wrists and ankles were 
of plastic and supposedly would not 
abrade human skin, but they served 
no sane purpose now and Holt 
would have removed them if he 
could. 



A stranger seeing the girl Lucin- 
da who sat now at Janda’s side to 
feed him, might have supposed her 
to be his daughter. She was his 
sister, five years younger than he. 
She was also a girl of rare beauty, 
and perhaps Mical’s police had mor 
tives other than mercy in sending 
her to Nogara’s court unmarked and 
un-brainwashed. It was rumored that 
the demand for certain kinds of en- 
tertainment was strong among the 
courtiers, and the turnover among 
the entertainers high. 

Holt had so far kept himself from 
believing such stories. He opened the 
brig now — he kept it locked only to 
prevent Janda’s straying out and 
falling childlike into an accident — 
and went in. 

When the girl Lucinda had first 
come aboard his ship her eyes had 
shown helpless hatred of every Es- 
teeler. Holt had been gentle and as 
helpful as possible to her in the days 
since then, and there was not even 
dislike in the face she raised to him 
now — there was a hope which it 
seemed she had to share with some- 
one. 

She said: “I think he spoke my 
name, a few minutes ago.” 

“Oh?” Holt bent to look more 
closely at Janda, and could* see no 
change. The outlaw’s eyes still stared 
glassily, the right eye now and then 
dripping a tear that seemed to have 
no connection with any kind of 
emotion. Janda’s jaw was as slack 
as ever, and his whole body as awk- 
wardly slumped. 

“Maybe — ” Holt didn’t finish. 

“What?” She was almost eager. 

Gods of Space, he couldn’t let 



38 



IF 




himself get involved with this girl. 
He almost wished to see hatred in 
her eyes again. 

“Maybe,” he said gently, “it will 
be better for your brother if he 
doesn’t make any recovery now. 
You know where he’s going.” 

Lucinda’s hope, such as it was, 
was shocked away by his words. She 
was silent, staring at her brother as 
if she saw something new. 

Holt’s wrist-intercom sounded. 

“Captain here,” he acknowledged. 

“Sir, reporting a ship detected and 
calling us. Bearing five o’clock level 
to our course. Small and normal.” 

The last three words were the 
customary reassurance that a sight- 
ed ship was not possibly a berserk- 
er’s giant hull. Berserkers all looked 
much alike, and what Flamland out- 
laws were left had no deep space 
ships, so Holt had no reason to be 
cautious. 

He went casually back to the 
bridge and looked at the small shape 
on the detector screen. It was un- 
familiar to him, but that was hardly 
surprising, as there were many ship- 
yards orbiting many planets. Why, 
though, should any ship approach 
and hail him in deep space? 

Plague? 

“No, no piague,” answered a ra- 
dio voice, through bursts of static, 
when he put the question to the 
stranger. The video signal from the 
other ship was also jumpy, making 
it hard to see the speaker’s face. 
“Caught a speck of dust on my last 
jump, and my fields are shaky. Will 
you take a few passengers aboard?” 

“Certainly.” For a ship on the 
brink of a C-plus jump to collide 



with the gravitation field of a siz- 
able dust-speck was a rare accident, 
but not unheard-of; and it would 
explain the noisy communications. 
There was still nothing to alarm 
Holt. 

The stranger sent over a launch 
which clamped to the courier’s air- 
lock. Wearing a smile of welcome 
for distressed passengers, Holt op- 
ened the lock. In the' next moment 
he and the half-dozen men who 
made up his crew were caught help- 
less by an inrush of man-sized ma- 
chines — they were a berserker’s 
boarding party, cold and ancient, 
merciless as nightmare. 

T he machines seized the courier 
so swiftly and efficiently that 
no one could offer real resistance, 
but they did not immediately kit! 
any of the humans. They tore the 
drive units from one of the life- 
boats and herded Holt and his crew 
and his erstwhile prisoners into the 
boat. 

“It wasn’t a berserker on the 
screen, it wasn’t,” the Second Offi- 
cer kept repeating to Holt. The hu- 
mans sat side by side, jammed 
against one another in the small 
space. The machines were allowing 
them air and water and food, and 
had started to take them out one at 
a time for questioning. 

“I know, it didn’t look like one,” 
Holt answered. “The berserkers are 
probably forming themselves into 
new shapes, building themselves new 
weapons. That’s only logical, after 
the Stone Place. The only odd thing 
is that no one foresaw it.” 

A hatch clanged open, and a pair 



MASQUE OF THE RED SHIFT 



39 




of roughly man-shaped machines 
entered the boat, picking their way 
precisely among the nine cramped 
humans until they reached the one 
they wanted. 

“No, he can’t talk!” Lucinda 
Arieked. “Don’t take him!” 

But the machines could not or 
would not hear her. They pulled Jan- 
da to his feet and marched him out. 
The girl followed, dragging at them, 
trying to argue with them. Holt 
could only scramble uselessly after 
her in the narrow space, afraid that 
one of the machines would turn and 
kill her. But they only kept her from 
following them out of the lifeboat, 
pushing her back from the hatch 
with metal hands as gently resistless 
as time. Then they were gone with 
Janda, and the hatch was closed 
again. Lucinda stood gazing at it 
blankly. She did not move when 
Holt put his arm around her. 

HI 

A fter a timeless period of waiting, 
the humans saw the hatch open 
again. The machines were back, but 
they did not return Janda. Instead 
they had come to take Holt. 

Vibrations echoed through the 
eourier’s hull; the machines seemed 
to be rebuilding her. In a small 
chamber sealed off by a new bulk- 
head from the rest of the ship, the 
berserker computer-brain had set up 
electronic eyes and ears and a speak- 
er for itself, and here Holt was tak- 
en to be interrogated. 

Speaking with a collection of re- 
corded human words, the berserker 
questioned Holt at great length. Al- 



most every question concerned Jo- 
hann Karlsen. It was known that the 
berserkers regarded Karlsen as their 
chief enemy, but this one seemed to 
be obsessed with him — and unwill- 
ing to believe that he was really 
dead. 

“I have captured your charts and 
astrogational settings,” the berserk- 
er reminded Holt. “1 know your 
course is to Nirvana , where suppos- 
edly the non-functioning Karlsen has 
been taken. Describe this Nirvana - 
ship used by the life-unit Nogara.” 

So long as it had asked only about 
a dead man, Holt had given the ber- 
serker straight answers, not wanting 
to be tripped up in a useless lie. 
But a flagship was a different mat- 
ter, and now he hesitated. Still, there 
was little he could say about Nir- 
vana if he wanted to. And he and 
his fellow prisoners had had no 
chance to agree on any plan for de- 
ceiving the berserker; certainly it 
must be listening to everything they 
said in the lifeboat. 

“I’ve never seen the Nirvana he 
answered truthfully. “But logic tells 
me it must be a strong ship, since 
the highest human leaders travel on 
it.” There was no harm in telling 
the machine what it could certainly 
deduce for itself. 

A door opened suddenly, and Hoh 
stared in surprise as a strange man 
entered the interrogation chamber. 
Then he saw that it was not a man, 
but some creation of the berserker. 
Perhaps its flesh was plastic, perhaps 
some product of tissue-culture. 

“Hi, are you Captain Holt?” asked 
the figure. There was no gross flaw 
in it, but a ship camouflaged with 



IF 




the greatest skill looks like nothing 
so much as a ship that has been 
camouflaged. 

When Holt was silent, the figure 
asked: “What’s wrong?” Its speech 
alone would have given it away, to 
an intelligent human who listened 
carefully. 

“You’re not a man,” Holt told it. 

The figure sat down and went 
limp. 

The berserker explained: “You 

see I am not capable of making an 
imitation life-unit that will be ac- 
cepted by real ones face to face. 
Therefore I require that you, a real 
life-unit, help me make certain of 
Karlsen’s death.** 

Holt said nothing. 

tcT am a special device,** the ber- 

1 serker said, “built by the ber- 
serkers with one prime goal, to 
bring about with certainty Karlsen’s 
death. If you help me prove him 
dead, I will willingly free you and 
the other life-units I now hold. If 
you refuse to help, all of you will 
receive the most unpleasant stimuli 
until you change your mind.** 

Holt did not believe that it would 
ever willingly set them free. But he 
had nothing to lose by talking, and 
he might at least gain for himself 
and the others a death free of most 
unpleasant stimuli. Berserkers pre- 
ferred to be efficient killers, not sa- 
dists, though during the long war 
they had become experts on the hu- 
man nervous system. 

“What sort of help do you want 
from me?” Holt asked. 

“When I have finished building 
myself into this courier we are going 



on to Nirvana , where you will de- 
liver your prisoners. I have read the 
orders. After being interviewed by 
the human leaders on Nirvana , the 
prisoners are to be taken on te 
Esteel for confinement. Is it not so?" 

“It is.” 

The door opened again, and Janda 
shuffled in, bent and bemused. 

“Can’t you spare this man any 
more questioning?” Holt asked the 
berserker. “He can’t help you in 
any way.” 

There was only silence. Holt wait- 
ed uneasily. At last, looking at Jan- 
da, he realized that something about 
the outlaw had changed. The tear* 
had stopped flowing from his right 
eye. 

When Holt saw this he felt a 
mounting horror that he could not 
have explained, as if his subcon- 
scious already knew what the ber- 
serker was going to say next. 

“What was bone in this life-unit 
is now metal,” the berserker said. 
“Where blood flowed, now preserva- 
tives are pumped. Inside the skull 
I have placed a computer, and in 
the eyes are cameras to gather the 
evidence I must have on Karlsen. 
To match the behavior of a brain- 
washed man is within my capabil- 
ity." 

“I do not hate you,” Lucinda said 
to the berserker when it had her 
alone for interrogation. “You are an 
accident, like a planet-quake, like a 
pellet of dust hitting a ship near 
light-speed. Nogara and his people 
are the ones I hate. If his brother 
was not dead I would kill him with 
my hands and willingly bring you 
his body.”

4 4 /Courier Captain? This is Gover- 

V- nor Mical, speaking for the 
High Lord Nogara. Bring your two 
prisoners over to Nirvana at once,” 
he ordered. 

“At once, sir.” 

After coming out of C-plus travel 
within sight of Nirvana , the assassin- 
machine had taken Holt and Lucin- 
da from the lifeboat. Then it had let 
the boat, with Holt’s crew still on it, 
drift out between the two ships, as 
if men were using it to check the 
courier’s fields. The men on the 
boat were to be the berserker’s hos- 
tages, and its shield if it was dis- 
covered. 

And by leaving them there, it 
doubtless wanted to make more 
credible the prospect of their event- 
ual release. 

Holt had not known how to tell 



Lucinda of her brother’s fate, but at 
last he had managed somehow. She 
had wept for a minute, and then she 
had become very calm. 

Now the berserker put Holt and 
Lucinda into the crystal globe that 
served it for a launch, for the trip 
to Nirvana. The machine that had 
been Lucinda’s brother was aboard 
the launch already, waiting, slump- 
ed and broken-looking as the man 
had actually been in the last days of 
his life. 

When she saw that figure, Lucin- 
da stopped. Then in a clear voice 
she said: “Machine, I wish to thank 
you. You have done my brother a 
kindness no human would do for 
him. I think I would have found a 
way to kill him myself before his 
enemies could torture him any 
more.”

T he Nirvana* s airlock was strong- 
ly armored, and equipped with 
automated defenses that would have 
repelled a rush of boarding ma- 
chines, just as Nirvana*s beams and 
missiles would have beaten off any 
heavy-weapons attack a courier, or 
a dozen couriers, could launch. The 
berserker had foreseen all this. 

An officer welcomed Holt aboard. 
‘This way, Captain, we’re all wait- 
tag.” 

“All?” 

The officer had the well-fed, com- 
fortable look that came with safe 
and easy duty. His eyes were busy 
appraising Lucinda. ‘There’s a cele- 
bration under way in the Great Hall. 
Your prisoners’ arrival has been 
much anticipated.” 

Music throbbed in the Great Hall, 
and dancers writhed in costumes 
more obscene than any nakedness. 
From a table running almost the 
length of the Hall, serving machines 
were clearing the remnants of whal 
had been a feast. In a throne-like 
chair behind the center of the table 
sat the High Lord Nogara, a rich 
cloak thrown over his shoulders, 
pale wine before him in a crystal 
foblet. Forty or fifty revelers flank- 
ed him at the long table, men and 
women and a few of whose sex Holt 
could not at once be sure. All were 
drinking and laughing, and some 
were donning masks and costumes, 
making ready for further celebration. 

Heads turned at Holt’s entrance, 
and a moment of silence was fol- 
lowed by a cheer. In all the eyes 
and faces turned now toward his 



prisoners, Holt could see nothing 
like pity. 

“Welcome, Captain,” said Nogara 
in a pleasant voice, when Holt had 
remembered to bow. “Is there news 
from Flamland?” 

“None of great importance, sir.” 

A puffy-faced man who sat at 
Nogara’s right hand leaned forward 
on the table. “No doubt there is 
great mourning for the late gover- 
nor?” 

“Of course, sir.” Holt recognized 
Mical. “And n^iuch anticipation of 
the new.” 

Mical leaned back in his chair, 
smiling cynically. “I’m sure the re- 
bellious population is eager for my 
arrival. Girl, were you eager to 
meet me? Come, pretty one, round 
the table, here to me.” As Lucinda 
slowly obeyed, Mical gestured to the 
serving devices. “Robots, set a chair 
for the man — there, in the center 
of the floor. Captain, you may re- 
turn to your ship.” 

Felipe Nogara was steadily re- 
garding the manacled figure of his 
old enemy Janda, and what Nogara 
might be thinking was hard to say. 
But he seemed content to let Mical 
give what orders pleased him. 

“Sir,” said Holt to Mical. “I 
would like to see — the remains of 
Johann Karlsen.” 

T hat drew the attention of No- 
gara, who nodded. A serving 
machine drew back sable draperies, 
revealing an alcove in one end of the 
Hall In the alcove, before a huge 
viewport, rested the coffin. 

Holt was not particularly surpris- 
ed; on many planets it was the cus- 



MASQUE OF THE RED SHIFT 



43 




tom to feast in the presence of the 
dead. After bowing to Nogara he 
turned and saluted and walked to- 
ward the alcove. Behind him he 
heard the shuffle and clack of 
Janda’s manacled movement, and 
held his breath. A muttering passed 
along the table, and then a sudden 
quieting in which even the throbbing 
music ceased. Probably Nogara had 
gestured premission for Janda’s walk, 
wanting to see what the brainwash- 
ed man would do. 

Holt reached the coffin and stood 
over it. He hardly saw the frozen 
face inside it, or the blur of the hy- 
permass beyond the port. He hardly 
heard the whispers and giggles of 
the revelers. The only picture clear 
in his mind showed the faces of his 
crew as they waited helpless in the 
grip of the berserker. 

The machine clothed in Janda’s 
flesh came shuffling up beside him, 
and its eyes of glass stared down 
into those of ice. A photograph of 
retinal patterns taken back to the 
waiting berserker for comparison 
with old captured records would tell 
it that this man was really K arisen. 

A faint cry of anguish made Holt 
look back toward the long table, 
where he saw Lucinda pulling her- 
self away from Mical’s clutching 
arm, Mical and his friends were 
laughing. 

“No, Captain, I am no Karlsen,” 
Mical called down to him, seeing 
Holt’s expression. “And do you think 
I regret the difference? Johann’s 
prospects are not bright. He is rath- 
er bounded by a nutshell, and can 
no longer count himself king of in- 
finite space!” 



“Shakespeare!” cried a sycophant, 
showing appreciation of Mical’s lit- 
erary erudition. 

“Sir.” Holt took a step forward. 
“May I — may I now take the pri- 
soners back to my ship?” 

Mical misinterpreted Holt’s anx- 
iety. “Oh ho! I see you appreciate 
some of life’s finer things, Captain. 
But as you know, rank has its pri- 
vileges. The girl stays here.” 

He had expected them to hold on 
to Lucinda, and she was better here 
than with the berserker. 

“Sir, then if — if the man alone 
can come with me. In a prison hos- 
pital on Esteel he may recover—” 
“Captain,” Nogara’s voice was not 
loud, but it hushed the table. “Do 
not argue here.” 

“No sir.” 

Mical shook his head. “My 
thoughts are not yet of mercy to 
my enemies, Captain. Whether they 
may soon turn in that direction — * 
well, that depends.” He again reached 
out a leisurely arm to encircle Lu- 
cinda. “Do you know, Captain, that 
hatred is the true spice of love?” 

H olt looked helplessly back at 
Nogara. Nogara’s cold eye said: 
One more word, courier, and you 
find yourself in the brig. I do not 
give two warnings. 

If Holt cried berserker now, the 
thing in Janda’s shape might kill 
everyone in the Hall before it could 
be stopped. He knew it was listen- 
ing to him, watching his movements. 

“I — I am returning to my ship,” 
he stuttered. Nogara looked away, 
and no one else paid him much at- 
tention. “I will — return here — in a 



IF 




few hours perhaps. Certainly before 
I drive for Esteel.” 

Holt’s voice trailed off as he saw 
that a group of the revelers had 
surrounded Janda. They had remov- 
ed the manacles from the outlaw’s 
dead limbs, and they were putting 
a horned helmet on his head, giving 
him a shield and spear and a cloak 
of fur, equipage of an old Norse 
warrior of Earth — first to coin and 
bear the dread name of berserker. 

“Observe, Captain,” mocked Mic- 
al’s voice. “At our masked ball we 
do not fear the fate of Prince Pros- 
pero. We willingly bring in the sem- 
blance of the terror outside!” 

“Poe!” shouted the sycophant in 
glee. 

Prospero and Poe meant nothing 
to Holt, and Mical looked disap- 
pointed. 

“Leave us. Captain,” said Nogara, 
making a direct order of it. 

“Leave, Captain Holt,” said Lu- 
cinda in a firm, clear voice. “We 
all know you wish to help those 
who stand in danger here. Lord No- 
gara, will Captain Holt be blamed 
in any way for what happens here 
when he has gone?” 

There was a hint of puzzlement 
in Nogara’s clear eyes. But he shook 
his head slightly, granting the asked- 
for absolution. 

And there was nothing for Holt 
to do but go back to the berserker 
to argue and plead with it for his 
crew. If it was patient, the evidence 
it sought might be forthcoming. If 
only the revelers would have mercy 
on the thing they thought was Jan- 
da. 

Holt went out. It had never en- 



tered his burdened mind that KarK- 
sen was only frozen. 

V 

M ical’s arm was about her hips 
as she stood beside his chair, 
and his voice purred up at her. 
“Why, how you tremble, pretty ons 
... it moves me that such a pretty 
one as you should, tremble at my 
touch, yes, it moves me deeply. 
Now. we are no longer enemies, are 
we? If we are, I should have to deal 
harshly with your brother.” 

She had given Holt time to get 
clear of the Nirvana. Now she swung 
her arm with all her strength. The 
blow turned Mical’s head halfway 
round, and made his neat gray hair 
fly wildly. 

There was a sudden hush in the 
Great Hali, and then a roar of 
laughter that reddened aH of Mical’s 
face to match the handprint on hk 
cheek. A man behind Lucinda grab- 
bed her arms and pinned them. She 
relaxed until she felt his grip loosen 
slightly, and then she grabbed up a 
table knife. There was another burst 
of laughter as Mical ducked away 
and the man behind Lucinda seized 
her again. Another man came te 
help him and the two of them, laugh- 
ing, took away the knife and forced 
her to sit in a chair at MicaPs side. 

When the governor spoke at last 
his voice quavered slightly, but it 
was low and almost calm. 

“Bring the man closer,” he order- 
ed. “Seat him there, just across the 
table from us.” 

While his order was being carried 
out, Mical spoke to Lucinda in con- 



MASQUE OF THE RED SHIFT 



45 




versational tones. “It was my intent, 
©f course, that your brother should 
be treated and allowed to recover.” 
He paused to see the effect of that 
statement on her. 

“Lying piece of filth,” she 
whispered, smiling. 

Mical only smiled back. “Let us 
test the skill of my mind-control 
technicians,” he suggested. “Fll 
wager that no bonds will be needed 
to hold your brother in his chair, 
once I have done this.” He made a 
curious gesture over the table, toward 
the glassy eyes that looked out of 
Janda’s face. “So. But he will still 
be aware, with every nerve, of all 
that happens to him. You may be 
sure of that.” 

She had planned and counted on 
something like this happening, but 
now she felt as if she was exhausted 
by breathing evil air. She was afraid 
of fainting, and at the same time 
wished that she could. 

“Our guest is bored with his cos- 
tume.” Mical looked up and down 
the table. “Who will be first to take 
a turn at entertaining him?” 

There was a spattering of ap- 
plause as a giggling effeminate arose 
from a nearby chair. 

“Jamy is known for his inventive- 
ness,” said Mical in pleasant tones 
to Lucinda. “I insist you watch close- 
ly, now. Chin up!” 

On the other side of Mical, Felipe 
Nogara was losing his air of remote- 
ness. As if reluctantly, he was being 
drawn to watch. In his bearing was a 
rising expectancy, winning out over 
disgust. 

Jamy came giggling, holding a 
small jeweled knife. 



“Not the eyes,” Mical cautioned. 
“The»’ll be things I want him to 
see, later.” 

“Oh, certainly!” Jamy twittered. 
He set the horned helmet gingerly 
aside, and wiped the touch of it 
from his fingers. “We’ll just start 
like this on one cheek, with a bit 
of skin — ” 

Jamy’s touch with the blade was 
gentle, but still too much for the 
dead flesh. At the first peeling tug, 
the whole lifeless mask fell red and 
wet from around the staring eyes, 
and his steel berserker-skull grinned 
out. 

L ucinda had just time to see 
Jamy’s body flung across the 
Hall by a steel-boned arm before 
the men holding her let go and turn- 
ed to flee for their lives, and she 
was able to duck under the table. 
Screaming bedlam broke loose, and 
in another moment the whole table 
went over with a crash before the 
berserker’s strength. The machine, 
finding itself discovered, twarted in 
its primary function of getting away 
with evidence on Karlsen, took as 
its secondary goal the old berserker 
one of simple killing. It moved 
through the Hall, squatting and hop- 
ping grotesquely, mowing its way 
with scythe-like arms, harvesting 
howling panic into bundles of bloody 
stillness. 

At the main door, fleeing people 
jammed one another into immobili- 
ty, and the assassin worked among 
them, methodically mangling and 
slaying. Then it turned and came 
down the Hall again. It came to 
Lucinda, still kneeling where the 



46 



IF 





table-tipping had exposed her; but 
the machine hesitated, recognizing 
her as a semi-partner in its prime 
function. In a moment it had dash- 
ed on after another target. 

It was Nogara, swaying on his 
feet, his right arm hanging broken. 
He had come up with a heavy hand- 
gun from somewhere, and now he 
fired left-handed as the machine 
charged down the other side of the 
overturned table toward him. The 
gun-blasts shattered Nogara’s friends 
and furniture but only grazed his 
moving target. 

At last one shot hit home. The 
machine was wrecked, but its impetus 
carried it on to knock Nogara down 
again. 

There was a shaky quiet in the 
Great Hall, which was wrecked as 
if by a bomb. Lucinda got unsteadily 

MASQUE OF THE RED SHIFT 



to her feet. There were sobs and 
moans and gropings everywhere, but 
no one else was standing. 

She picked her way dazedly over 
to the smashed assassin-machine. She 
felt only a numbness, looking at the 
rags of clothing and flesh that still 
clung to its metal frame. Now in her 
mind she could see her brother’s 
face as it once was, strong and 
smiling. 

Now there was somthing that mat- 
tered more than the dead, if she 
could only recall what it was — of 
course, the berserker’s hostages, the 
good kind spacemen. She could try 
to trade Karlsen’s body for them. 

r ie serving machines, built to face 
emergencies on the order of 
spilled wine, where dashing to and 
fro in the nearest thing to panic 



that mechanism could achieve. They 
impeded Lucindas progress, but she 
had the heavy' coffin wheeled half- 
way across the Hall when a weak 
voice stopped her. Nogara had drag- 
fed himself up to a sitting position 
against the overturned table. 

He croaked again: 44 — alive.’* 

“What?” 

“Johann’s alive. Healthy. See? 
It’s a freezer.” 

“But we all told the berserker he 
was dead.” She felt stupid with the 
impact of one shock after another. 
For the first time she looked down 
at Karlsen’s face, and long seconds 
passed before she could tear her eyes 
away. 44 It has hostages. It wants his 
body.” 

“No.” Nogara shook his head. “I 
see, now. But no. I won’t give him 
to berserkers, alive.” A brutal power 
of personality still emanated from 
his broken body. His gun was gone, 
but his power kept Lucinda from 
moving. There was no hatred in her 
now. 

She protested: “But there are 

•even men out there.” 

“Berserker’s like me.” Nogara 
bared pain-clenched teeth. “It won’t 
let prisoners go. Here. The key . .” 
He pulled it from inside his torn- 
open tunic. 

Lucinda’s eyes were drawn once 
again to the cold serenity of the 
face in the coffin. Then on impulse 
she ran to get the key. When she 
did so Nogara slumped over in re- 
lief, unconscious or nearly so. 

The coffin lock was marked in 
several positions, and she turned 
it to EMERGENCY REVIVAL. 
Lights sprang on around the figure 



inside, and there was a hum of 
power. 

By now the automated systems of 
the ship were reacting to the 
emergency. The serving machines 
had begun a stretcher-bearer service. 
Nogara being one of the first vic- 
tims they carried away. Presumably 
a robot medic was in action some- 
where. From behind Nogara’s 
throne chair a great voice was 
shouting. 

“This is ship defense control, re- 
questing human orders! What is na- 
ture of emergency?” 

“Do not contact the courier ship!” 
Lucinda shouted back. “Watch it for 
an attack. But don’t hit the life- 
boat!” 

The glass top of the coffin had 
become opaque. 

Lucinda ran to the viewport, 
stumbling over the body of Mical 
and going on without a pause. By 
putting her face against the port 
and looking out at an angle she 
could just see the berserker-courier, 
pinkly visible in the wavering light 
of the hypermass, its lifeboat of hos- 
tages a small pink dot still in place 
before it. 

How long would it wait, before it 
killed the hostages and fled? 

When she turned away from the 
port, she saw that the coffin’s lid 
was open and the man inside was 
sitting up. For just a moment, a 
moment that was to say in Lucin- 
da’s mind, his eyes were like a 
child’s, fixed helplessly on hers. 
Then power began to grow behind 
his eyes, a power somehow com- 
pletely different from his brother’s 
and perhaps even greater. 



48 



IF 




K arisen looked away from her, 
taking in the rest of his sur- 
roundings, the devastated Great Hall 
and the coffin. “Felipe,” he whis- 
pered, as if in pain, though his half- 
brother was no longer in sight. 

Lucinda moved toward him and 
started to pour out her story, from 
the day in the Flamland prison when 
she had heard that Karlsen had fal- 
len to the plague. 

Once he interrupted her. “Help 
me out of this thing, get me space 
armor.” His arm was hard and 
strong when she grasped it, but 
when he stood beside her he was - 
surprisingly short. “Go on, what 
then?” 

She hurried on with her tale, 
while serving machines came to arm 
him. “But why were you frozen?” 
she ended, suddenly wondering at 
his health and strength. 

He ignored the question. “Come 
along to Defense Control. We must 
save those men out there.” 

He went familiarly to the nerve 
center of the ship and hurled him- 
self into the combat chair of the 
Defense Officer, who was probably 
dead. The panel before Karlsen 
came alight and he ordered at once: 
“Get me in contact with that cour- 
ier.” 

Within a few moments a flat- 
sounding voice from the courier 
answered routinely. The face that ap- 
peared cm the communication screen 
was badly lighted; someone viewing 
it without advance warning would 
not suspect that it was anything but 
human. 

“This is High Commander Karl- 
sen speaking, from the Nirvana” 



He did not call himself governor or 
lord, but by his title of the great 
day of the Stone Place. “Fm coming 
over there. I want to talk to you 
men on the courier.” 

The shadowed face moved slight- 
ly on the screen. “Yes sir.” 

Karlsen broke off the contact at 
once. “That’ll keep its hopes up. 
Now I need a fast launch. You, 
robots, load my coffin aboard one. 
Fm on emergency revival drugs now 
and if I live I may have to re-freeze 
for a while.” 

“You’re not really going there?” 
Up out of the chair again, he 
paused. “I know berserkers. If chas- 
ing me is that thing’s prime func- 
tion it won’t waste a shot or a second 
of time on a few hostages while Fm 
in sight.” 

“You can’t go,” Lucinda heard 
herself saying. “You mean too much 
to all men — ” 

“Fm not committing suicide, I 
have a trick or two in mind.” Karl- 
sen’s voice changed suddenly. “You 
say Felipe’s not dead?” 

“I don’t think so.” 

Karlsen’s eyes closed while his 
lips moved briefly, silently. Then he 
looked at Lucinda and grabbed up 
paper and a stylus from the Defense 
Officer’s console. “Give this to 
Felipe,” he said, writing. “He’ll set 
you and the captain free if I ask it. 
You’re not dangerous to his power. 
Whereas I . .”

F rom the Defense Officer’s posi- 
tion, Lucinda watched Karlsen’s 
crystalline launch leave the Nirvana

and take a long curve that brought 
it near the courier at a point some 
distance from the lifeboat. 

“You on the courier,” Lucinda 
heard him say. “You can tell it’s real- 
ly me here on the launch, can’t you? 
You can DF my transmission? Can 
you photograph my retinas through 
the screen?” 

And the launch darted away with 
a right-angle swerve, dodging and 
twisting at top acceleration, as the 
berserker’s weapons blasted the space 
where it had been. Karlsen had 
been right. The berserker spent not 
a moment’s delay or a single shot 
on the lifeboat, but hurled itself in- 
stantly after the launch. 

“Hit that courier!” Lucinda 
screamed. “Destroy it!” A salvo of 
missiles left the Nirvana , but it was 
a shot at a receding target, and it 
missed. Perhaps it missed because 
the courier was already in the fringes 
of the distortion surrounding the 
hypermass. 

Karlsen’s launch had not been hit, 
but it could not get away. It was a 
glassy dot vanishing behind a screen 
of blasts from the berserker’s wea- 
pons, a dot being forced into the 
maelstrom of the hypermass. 

“Chase them!” cried Lucinda, and 
saw the stars tint blue ahead; but al- 
most instantly the Nirvana's auto 
pilot countermanded her order, bark- 
ing mathematical assurance that to 
accelerate any further in that direc- 
tion would be fatal to all aboard. 

The launch was now going cer- 



tainly into the hypermass, gripped 
by a gravity that could make any 
engines useless. And the berserker- 
ship was going headlong after the 
launch, caring for nothing but to 
make sure of Karlsen. 

The two specks tinted red, and 
redder still, racing before an enor- 
mous falling cloud of dust as if flying 
into a planet’s sunset sky. And then 
the red shift of the hypermass took 
them into invisibility, and the uni- 
verse saw them no more. 

S oon after the robots had brought 
the men from the lifeboat safe 
aboard Nirvana , Holt found Lucinda 
alone in the Great Hall, gazing out 
the viewport. 

“He gave himself to save you,” 
she said. “And he’d never even seen 
you.” 

“I know.” After a pause Holt 
said: “I’ve just been talking to the 
Lord Nogara. I don’t know why, 
but you’re to be freed, and I’m not 
to be prosecuted for bringing the 
damned berserker aboard. Though 
Nogara seems to hate both of us . .” 
She wasn’t listening, she was still 
looking out the port. 

“I want you to tell me all about 
him someday,” Holt said, putting his 
arm around Lucinda. She moved 
slightly, ridding herself of a minor ir- 
ritation that she had hardly noticed. 
It was Holt’s arm, which dropped 
away. 

“I see,” Holt said, after a while. 
He went to look after his men. END

“Jik-jik,” someone called to him

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE — 



The planet of Quopp Is inhabited by creatures that are half 
machines, and all diabolical. Their body chemistry is organic-in- 
organic, with limbs like wheels or rotors and steel-sharp talons 
and teeth. 

It is, in short, the kind of world where Earthmen walk cau- 
tiously, or do not walk at all. 

But Earth Ambassador Longspoon is confident he has the 
situation under control. With the connivance of certain native 
Quoppina he is abetting the spread of a revolutionary move- 
ment which will unite all of Quopp's scores of hostile tribes, plac- 
ing them all under a single government which will be friendly to 
Earth ... he hopes. 

Unfortunately his hopes are blighted. Retief discovers ship- 
ments of arms and, investigating, finds himself threatened by the 
Voion tribesmen. He escapes and makes his way to Terrie head- 
quarters, which is in an uproar because a spaceship loaded with 
human females is approaching the planet out of control. The 
pilot asks for Retief but crashes before he can learn her identity. 
Meanwhile Retief is being pursued by the Voions, trying to keep 
their arms shipments secret. He escapes with the help of a friendly 
Quopp, who assists him in disguising himself in the mandibles and 
chitinous body-plates of a typical Quopp. 

The Voion hunt for Retief has triggered an insurrection in the 
city. All Terries are being rounded up, but Retief's disguise gets 
him through to where he can steal a lifeboat and head out into the 
jungle, toward safety and, he hopes, a chance to rescue the 
clowned ship of Earth-girls. He lands — and is himself captured

member of the Planetary Police. He 
groaned as they dropped him. One 
of his wheels, badly warped, whirled

“Hoo, this evening shaping up,”

The Voion was lying on his back, 
waving all four arms feebly. 

“You can’t do this to me,” the

to the fallen policeman brought his

sound like a pistol shot as he nipped 
off the newcomer’s head with a 
single snap. 

“Well, that the first of them big 
noises I see trimmed up like he 
ought to be,” Jik-jik said. “You got 
him just in time, Fut-fut, before he 
call on the Name of the Worm — ” 
He broke off, looked at Retief. 

“In the Name of the Worm,” Re- 
tief said, “what about a little hos- 
pitality?” 

“You and your big vocalizing ap- 
paratus, Jik-jik,” someone said dis- 
gustedly. “Well, back to camp. At 
least we can fry up some policeman 
to tide us over.” A quartet of Ween 
lifted the limp body; someone else 
picked up the head. 

“Lucky for you you call on the 
Name of the Worm,” Jik-jik said 
conversationally. “Old Hub-hub 
ready to dine right now, what I 
mean.” 

“Mentioning the Worm takes me 
off the menu, eh?” 

“Well, it give you time to get 
you thoughts in order, anyway.” 

“I have a feeling that remark is 
pregnant with meanings, none of 
them pleasant.” 



“Hoo, it simple enough, big boy. 
It mean us keep you pen up for 
five days, and then skin you out 
for a old-fashioned tribal blowout.” 

An aggressive-looking Ween had 
pushed forward. “How about if us 
trim off a few edges now just to 
sample the flavor?” 

“Get back there, Hub-hub,” Jik- 
jik admonished. “No snacking be- 
tween meals.” 

“Come on, Meat-from-sky,” the 
aggressive pigmy called. “Get you 
wheels in gear!” He reached out 
with his claw to prod Retief — and 
jumped back with a screech as the 
heavy sword whipped down, lop- 
ping off an inch of the member’s 
pointed tip. 

“Look what he do to my chop- 
per!” he shrilled. 

“You ask for it, Hub-hub,” Fut- 
fut said. 

“I like a lot of space around me,” 
Retief said, swinging the sword 
loosely in his hand. “Don’t crowd 
me. 

T he Ween edged back, fifty or 
more small, dark-glittering crea- 
tures like oversized army ants in a 
wide ring around Retief, his armor 
a splash of vivid color in the gloom. 
Hub-hub jittered, holding his dam- 
aged claw high, torch-light glinting 
on his metallic sides. 

“I is hereby taking this piece of 
meat off the chow list!” he screech- 
ed. “I is promoting him to the status 
of folks!” 

“Hey, Hub-hub, is you gone out 
of you head? What the idea of 
doing a trick like that?” A chorus 
of protest broke out.

Jik-jik confronted the outraged 
tribesman. 

“He chop off a piece of you, and 
now you chumming up to him! 
What the idea?” 

“The idea is now I ain’t got to 
wait no five days to get a piece 
back!” Hub-hub keened. “Get back, 
all of you!” He waved the two-foot 
long, steel-trap claw in a command- 
ing gesture. “I is now going to snip 
this stilter down to size!” 

The Ween drew back, disappoint- 
ed, but obedient to Tribal custom. 
Hub-hub danced before Retief, who 
waited, his back to the tree, the 
sword held before him, torch-light 
glinting along its steel-hard razor- 
sharp edge. Hub-hub darted in, legs 
twinkling, snick-snacked a double 
feint high and low with the big fight- 
ing arm, lashed out viciously with 
a pair of small pinchers, then struck 
with the big claw, eliciting a loud 
bang! from Retief s chest armor — 
and staggered as the flat of Retief s 
blade knocked him spinning. 

“Hoo!” Jik-jik shrilled. “Old Hub- 
hub chew off more than he can bite 
this time!” 

“Let’s call this off, Shorty,” Re- 
lief suggested. “I’d hate to have to 
skewer you before we’ve really got- 
ten acquainted.” 

The Ween danced in, pivoting on 
spider legs, feinted, struck with his 
fighting claw — 

Retief’s sword flashed in a light- 
ning arc. It sang as it bit through 
steel-hard metallo-chitin. The over- 
sized claw dropped to the ground. 

“He ... he done chop off my 
chopper!” Hub-hub said faintly. 
••Now he going stick me for sure.” 



He crouched, waiting, a drop of 
syrupy dark fluid forming on the 
stump. 

“Serve you right, Hub-hub,” 
someone called. 

“Suppose I let you go?” Retief 
stepped forward and prodded the 
Ween’s slender neck with the sword 
point. “Promise to be good and 
speak only when spoken to?” 

“Way I feels now, I done talking 
for good,” Hub-hub declared. 

“Very well.” Retief lowered the 
blade. “Go with my blessing.” 
“Well, that a neat trick, big boy,” 
Jik-jik commented. “Take him six 
months to grow a new arm, and 
meantime he learn to keep he man- 
dible buttoned.” 

Retief looked around. “Anybody 
else?” he inquired. There were no 
takers. 

“In that case, I’ll be on my way. 
You’re sure you haven’t noticed a 
ship crashing in the vicinity in the 
past few hours?” 

“Well, now, that’s different,” Jik- 
jik stated. “They was a big smash 
over yonder a while back. We was 
looking for it when we found you.” 
“The name’s Retief. Now that 
we’re all friends and tribesfellows, 
how about a few of you showing me 
the spot where it came down?” 
“Sure, Tief-tief. It not far from 
where you was.” 

Retief walked over to examine the 
body of the decapitated Voion. He 
had obviously been a member of 
Ikk’s police — or army — complete 
with brand-new chromallov inlays 
and an enameled cranium insignia 
with a stylized picture of what look- 
ed like a dragonfly.

“I wonder what this fellow was 
doing out here, so far from town,” 
Retief said. 

“I don’t know,” Jik-jik said; “but 
I got a feeling when us finds out 
us ain’t going like it.” 

V 

T he bright disc of Joop was high 
above the treetops, shedding a 
cold white light on the village street. 
Retief followed as Jik-jik and two 
other tribesmen led the way along 
a trail worn smooth by the wheels 
of generations of forest dwellers. It 
was a fifteen minute trek to the spot 
where Pin-pin halted and waved an 
arm. 

“Yonder where I found that po- 
liceman,” he said. “Back in the 
brush. I heard he cussing up a cy- 
clone back there.” 

Retief pushed through came to a 
spot where fallen limbs and scat- 
tered leaves marked the position of 
die injured Voion. Above, the silv- 
ery ends of broken branches marked 
a trajectory through the tree-tops. 

“What I wondering, how he get 
up there?” Pin-pin inquired. “Funny 
stuff going on around here. Us heard 
the big crash — that why us out 
here.” 

“The big crash — which way was 
that?” Retief asked. 

“Yonder,” Pin-pin pointed. Again 
he led the way, guided by the un- 
erring Quoppina instinct for direc- 
tion. Fifty feet along the trail, Retief 
stooped, picked up a twisted frag- 
ment of heavy, iron-gray metallo- 
chitin, one edge melted and charred. 
He went on, seeing more bits and 



pieces. A bright-edged shred here, 
swinging from a bush, a card-table- 
sized plate there, wedged high in a 
tree. Then suddenly the dull-gleam- 
ing mass of a major fragment of the 
wrecked Rhoon loomed through the 
underbrush, piled against the ribbed 
base of a forest giant. 

“Hoo, that big fellow hit hard, 
Tief-tief,” Pin-pin said. “Wonder 
what bring him down?” 

“Something he tried to eat dis- 
agreed with him.” Retief made his 
way around the giant corpse, noting 
the blaster burns on the stripped hub 
of the rotors, the tangle of internal 
organic wiring exposed by the force 
of the crash, the twisted and shatter- 
ed landing members. The rear half 
of the body was missing, torn away 
in the passage through the trees. 

“Wonder what a Rhoon meet big 
enough to down him?” Pin-pin won- 
dered. “He the toughest critter in 
this jungle; everyone spin gravel 
when a Rhoon flit overhead.” The 
Ween dipped a finger in a smear of 
spilled lubricant, waved R near an 
olfactory organ. 

“Foo!” he snorted. “That gone 
plumb rancid already! I guess we 
don’t make no meal off this fellow!” 

Retief clambered up the side of 
the downed behemoth, looked down 
into an open cavity gouged in the 
upper side of the thorax, just anter- 
ior to the massive supporting struc- 
tures for the rotating members. 
Wires were visible; not the irregular- 
diametered organic conduits of the 
Quoppina internal organization, but 
bright-colored cables bearing letter- 
ing .. 

“Hey, Tief-tief!” Pin-pin called 



RETIEFS WAR

suddenly “Us better get scarce! This 
boy’s relations is out looking for 
him!” 

Retief looked up; a great dark 
shape was visible, hovering a few 
hundred feet above tree-top level. 
By the bright light of Joop, a sec- 
ond and a third Rhoon appeared, 
cruising slowly back and forth over 
the position of their fallen comrade. 

“They going to spot him any min- 
ute now,” Pin-pin said. “T say let’s 
get!” 

“They can’t land here,” Retief 
said. “They’ve already spotted him; 
they’re patrolling the location.” He 
looked around, listening. There was 
the whine of the breeze among me- 
tallic leaves, the high throb of idling 
Rhoon rotors, a distant rustle of 
underbrush . 

“Somebody’s coming,” Retief said. 
“Let’s fade back and watch.” 

“Look Tief-tief, I just remember- 
ed. I got a roof needs patching — ” 

“We’ll lie low and pull back if 
it’s more than we can handle. Pin- 
pin. I don’t want to miss anything.” 

“Well . .” The three Ween went 
into a hurried consultation, then 
clacked in reluctant agreement. 
“Okay — but if it’s a bunch of them 
no-good Voion coming to see what 
they can steal, us leaving,” Pin-pin 
announced. 

I t was five minutes before the first 
of the approaching group came 
into view among the great scarlet- 
and purple-boled trees, laden with 
full field packs and spare tires. 

“What I tell you?” Pin-pin whis- 
pered shrilly. “More of them police- 
men! They all over the place.” 



Retief and the Ween watched as 
more and more Voion came up, 
crowding into the clearing leveled 
by the passage of the Rhoon, all 
chattering in a subdued buzz, fin- 
gering their blackwood clubs and 
staring about them into the forest. 

“Plenty of them.” a Ween hissed. 
“Must is six sixes of sixes if they’s 
a one.” 

“More than that. Look at ’em 
come!” 

An imposing-looking Voion with 
a jewel in his left palp appeared; the 
others fell back, let him through. He 
rolled up beside the dead Rhoon, 
looked it over. 

“Any sign of Lieutenant Xit?” he 
demanded in Trade dialect. 

“What he say?” Pin-pin whisper- 
ed. 

“He’s looking for the one you 
fellows found,” Retief translated for 
him. 

“Oh-oh. They ain’t going to like 
it if they finds him.” 

The conversation among the 
Voion continued: 

“. trace of him. Colonel. But 
there’s a native village not far away. 
Maybe they can help us.” 

The colonel clacked his palps. 
“They’ll help us,” he grated. “Which 
way?” 

The Voion pointed. “Half a mile 
— there.” 

“All right, let’s march.” The col- 
umn formed up, started off in a new 
direction. 

“For a minute 1 figure they mean 
Weensville,” Pin-pin said. “But they 
headed for the Zilk town.” 

“Can we skirt them and get there 
first?” Retief asked.

IP 




“I reckon. But I ain’t hungry just 
now — and besides, with them po- 
licemens on the way — ” 

“I’m not talking about grocery 
topping,” Retief said. “Those 
Voion are in a mean mood. I want 
•o warn the villagers.” 

“But they’s Zilk. What we care 
what happen to them babies?” 

“The Terries I’m looking for might 
be there. I’d prefer to reach them 
before the Voion do. Beside which, 
you villagers should stick together.” 
“Tief-tief, you is got funny ideas, 
but if that’s what you wants . 

R etief and his guides pushed 
through a final screen of un- 
derbrush, emerged at the edge of a 
cleared and planted field where the 
broad yellow leaves of a ripening 
crop of alloy-plants caught the Joop- 
Hght. 

“Them Zilk a funny bunch,” Pin- 
pin said. “Eats nothing but greens. 
Spends all they time grubbing in the 
ground.” 

“In that case, I don’t suppose 
they have to wait until a policeman 
drops in to plan a meal,” Retief 
pointed out. He started across the 
open field. 

“Hoo, Tief-tief!” Pin-pin hurried 
after him. “When I say they don’t 
cat folks, that don’t mean they don’t 
snap a mean chopper! Us is tangled 
with them before, plenty of times! 
You can’t just wheel in on ’em!” 
“Sorry, Jik-jik. No time for for- 
malities now. Those cops aren’t far 
behind us.” 

A tall, lean, Quoppina appeared 
at the far side of the field — a bright 
yellow-orange specimen with long 



upper arms tipped with specialized 
earth-working members, shorter, 
blade-bearing limbs below. 

“Oh-oh; they sees us. Too late to 
change our minds now.” Jik-jik held 
his fighting claw straight up in a 
gesture indicating peaceful intentions. 

“What d’ye want here, ye mur- 
derous devils?” a high, mellow voice 
called. 

“I’m looking for a party of Ter- 
rans whose boat crashed near here 
a few hours back,” Retief called. 
“Have you seen them?” 

“Terrans, is it?” The Zilk hoot- 
ed. “I’ve not seen ’em. And if I 
had, I’d not be likely to turn ’em 
over to the likes o’ you.” 

Other Zilk were popping from the 
low, domed huts now, fanning out, 
moving forward on both flanks in 
an encircling pincer -movement. At 
close range, Retief could see the 
businesslike foot-long scythes tipping 
the lower arms. 

4 4T isten here, you Zilk,” Jik-jik 
called in a voice which may 
have quavered a trifle. “In the name 
of the Worm! Us ain’t just here to 
ask foolish questions; us is got news 
for you folks.” 

“And we’ve got news for you — 
not that ye’ll ever have the chance 
to spread it about — ” 

“Us come to tip you folks off,” 
the Ween persisted. “They a mob 
of mean-looking Voion on the way! 
Less you wants to tangle with ’em. 
you better head for the brush!” 
“Don’t try to put us off with wild 
tales, Ween!” 

“It’s the truth, if I ever told it!” 
“Why would ye teU us?” 



IP 




“Beat me. It were Tief-tief here 
had the idea.” 

“What kind of Quoppina is he?” 
Ac Zilk called. “I’ve seen no stilter 
wi’ half the length o* member that 
one shows.” 

“He a out-of-town boy just pass- 
ing through.” 

“’Tis a trick, Wikker,” a Zilk be- 
tide the spokesman hooted. “I’d not 
trust the little butchers as far as I 
could kick ’em — nor the big stilter, 
neither.” 

“The Voion are looking for a 
friend of theirs,” Retief said. “They 
have an idea you’ll help them look.” 

“We’ll help ’em off our land,” a 
Zilk stated. “I seen a mort o’ the 
scoundrels about the acreage lately, 
running in packs and trampling the 
crops.” 

“They’re armed and they mean 
business,” Retief said. “Better get 
ready.” 

The Zilk were closing in now; the 
two Ween crowded up against Re- 
lief, their fighting claws clicking like 
castanets. Retief drew his sword. 

“You’re making a mistake,” he 
told the advancing Zilk leader. 
“They’ll be here any minute.” 

“A sly trick, ye heathens. But we 
Zilk are too shrewd for ye.” 

“Hey!” A Zilk called. The others 
turned. The lead elements of the 
Voion column were just emerging 
from the forest. At once, the Zilk 
formation broke, fell back in confu- 
sion toward the town. 

“Get the females and grubs clear,” 
the Zilk chief honked, and dashed 
away with the rest. The Voion colo- 
nel, seeing the tribesmen in confu- 
sion, barked an order; his troops 



rolled forward through the field, 
clubs ready. 

“Let them have the town!” Retief 
seized the arm of the chief as he 
shot by. “Disperse in the jungle and 
you can re-form for a counter at- 
tack!” 

The Zilk jerked free. “Well — 
maybe. Who’d ha’ thought a crowd 
of Ween were telling the truth?” He 
rushed away. 

The Voion were well into the 
village now. Startled Zilk, caught 
short, dashed from huts and wheel- 
ed for cover, burdened with hastily 
salvaged possessions — only to drop 
them and veer off with hoots of 
alarm as fast-wheeling Voion inter- 
cepted them. 

“Us better back off,” Jik-jik pro- 
posed from the shelter of a hut on 
the sidelines. 

“Scout around and try to round 
up the survivors,” Retief said. “Pin- 
pin, you make it back to Weensville 
and bring up reinforcements. The 
Voion need a little lesson in inter- 
tribal cooperation before their suc- 
cess goes to their heads.” 

H alf an hour later, from a screen' 
of narrow pink leaves that 
tinkled in the light breeze, Retief, 
several dozen Zilk and seventy-odd 
Ween watched by the waning light 
of the fast-sinking loop. A swarm 
Retief estimated at three hundred 
Voion, a few showing signs of the 
brisk engagement, prodded their cap- 
tives into a ragged line-up. 

“I don’t know what’s got into 
them babies,” Jik-jik said. “Used to 
be they garbage-pickers, slipping 
around after Second Joop, looking 



lETIEF'S WAR 



59 




for what they could pick up. Now 
here they is, all shined up and act- 
ing like they rule the roost.” 

“They’ve gotten a disease called 
ambition,” Retief said. “The form 
they have causes a severe itch in 
the acquisitive instinct.” 

“Not much meat on a Zilk,” 
someone mused. “What you reckon 
they want over here? Can’t be they 
just looking for they boy; them 
Voion never frets over no trifles 
like that.” 

“Hoo!” Fut-fut said, coming to 
Retief’s side. “Look what they up 
to now!” 

The Voion, having arranged the 
captive Zilk in two columns of a 
dozen or so individuals of both 
sexes, were busy with strips of flex- 
ible metallo-plastic, welding shackles 
to the arms of the first in line, while 
others of their number poised with 
raised clubs to punish any resistance. 
The lead Zilk, seeing the chain 
about to be linked to him, lashed out 
suddenly with his scythe, severing 
a Voion arm at the first joint, then 
plunged through the circle around 
him, dashed for the jungle. A Voion 
wheeled into his path, brought his 
club around in a whistling arc — 
and bounced aside as the Zilk snap- 
ped out an overlong digging arm, 
just as two more Voion closed from 
the off side, brought their clubs 
down in unison. 

The Zilk skidded aside, arms 
whirling, crashed in a heap and lay 
still. 

“Nice try, Wikker,” the Zilk chief 
muttered. “Don’t reckon I’d endure 
chains on me, either.” 

“That’s what happens when you 



play it their way,” Retief said. “I 
suggest we work out some new 
rules. We’ll decoy them into the 
jungle, break up their formation and 
take them one at a time.” 

“What you mean, Hef-tief? Ut 
going to tackle them ugly babies?” 
“Sure. Why not?” 

“Well, I guess you is right Us 
ain’t got nothing else scheduled for 
the evening.” 

“Good,” Retief said. “Now, here's 
what I’ve got in mind . 

VI 

T hree Voion working busily to 
pry the lid from the Zilk Town 
grain bin paused in their labors. 
Again the thin cry sounded from 
the forest near at hand. 

“Sounds like a lost grub,” one 
said. “A little tender roast meal 
wouldn’t go bad now. Pounding in 
the skull-plates of -farmers is hard 
work.” 

“Let’s take a look. The Colonel's 
busy overseeing the looting; he won’t 
notice us.” 

“Let's go.” The three dropped 
their pry-bars and wheeled briskly 
across to the deep shadow of the 
thicket whence the sound emanated. 
The first in line thrust branches 
aside, rolled slowly forward, peer- 
ing through the shadows. There was 
a dull smack! and he seemed to 
duck down suddenly. The Voion be- 
hind him hurried forward. “Find 
it?” he inquired, then skidded to a 
halt. “Juz!” he whistled. “Where’s 
your head?” Something small and 
blue-green sprang up before him, a 
huge claw opening — 



60 



IF 




At the sound — a sharp whock! 
— the third Voion halted. “Huj?” 
he called. “Juz? What’s go — ” A 
scythe swung with a whistle and his 
head bounced off to join those of 
his comrades. Jik-jik and Tupper, 
the Zilk leader, emerged from the 
brush. 

“Work like a charm,” the Ween 
said. “Let’s do it again.” 

Behind him, Retief turned from 
surveying the work in progress in 
the town. 

“I think the Colonel’s beginning 
to suspect something. He’s falling 
his men in for a roll-call. How many 
have we given haircuts to so far?” 
“Half a six of sixes, maybe.” 
“We’ll have to stage a group di- 
version before he figures out what’s 
going on. Tell Fut-fut and his group 
to wait five minutes, then kick up 
a disturbance on the far side of the 
trail we came in on.” 

Jik-jik keened orders to a half- 
grown Ween who darted away to 
spread the word. 

“Now we’ll string out along the 
trail. They’ll probably come out in 
single file. Keep out of sight until 
their lead unit’s well past our last 
man. At my signal we’ll hit them all 
together and pull back fast.” 

“It sounds slick. Let’s roll.” 
Three minutes later, as a Voion 
sergeant continued to bark out 
names, the small messenger darted 
up to the position where Retief 
waited beside the trail. “Old Fut- 
fut ready, he say,” the lad chirped 
breathlessly. “Hey, Jik-jik! Can I 
get me one?” 

“You ain’t got the chopper for 
it, Ip-ip; but you can scout around 



the other side of the town. Soon at 
you hear them policemen’s heads 
popping you set up a ruckus. That’ll 
keep ’em guessing — them that sdfl 
has guessing equipment. Now scat! 
It time for the fun to begin.” 

A shrill yell sounded from Fut-fuFs 
position, then an angry yammer 
of Ween voices, accompanied by 
sounds of scuffling. 

From his concealment behind a 
yard-wide tree with a trunk like 
pale blue grass, Retief saw a stirring 
in the Voion ranks as they looked 
toward the outcry. The Colonel 
barked an order. A squad of Voion 
fell out and rolled quickly to the 
trail mouth. There was a moment 
of confusion as the troops milled, 
not liking the looks of the dark 
tunnel; then, at a shrill command 
from a sergeant, they formed a sin- 
gle file and started in. The first roll- 
ed past Retief ’s position, his club 
swinging loosely in his hand. He was 
followed closely by another, and an- 
other. Retief counted twenty before 
they stopped coming. He stepped 
from behind the tree, glanced to- 
ward the village; the roll-call went 
on. He drew his sword, put two fin- 
gers in his mouth and gave a shrill 
blast. 

At once there was a crash of 
underbrush, a staccato volley of 
snicks and snaps, followed in an in- 
stant by a lone Voion yell, quickly 
cut off. The last Voion in the col- 
umn, ducking back from the at- 
tacking Ween, spun and found him- 
self confronting Retief. He brought 
his club up and gave a shrill yelp 
as Retief’s roundhouse stroke cut

through the weapon near the grip. 

“Go back and tell the Colonel he 
has two hours to get to town,” Re- 
lief said. “Any Voion found loose 
m the jungle after that will be roast- 
ed over a slow fire.” He implement- 
ed the command with a blow with 
the flat of the blade that sent the 
Voion wobbling villageward; then he 
whirled and plunged into the dense 
growth, made for a vantage point 
overlooking the village. 

There was a high-pitched cry 
from the far side of the town. Ip- 
ip was at work. The Voion were 
milling now, unsettled by the sud- 
den noises. The one whose club Re- 
tief had clipped off charged into the 
midst of the platoon, shrilling and 
waving the stump of the weapon. 

“. forest demon!” he was yell- 
ing. “Nine feet high, with wheels 
like a juggernaut, and a head like a 
Voion, except it was red! Hundreds 
of them! I’m the only one got 
away.” 

Branches rustled and clanked as 
Jik-jik came up. “Hoo, Tief-tief, you 
quite a strategist. Got a passel of 
die trash that time! What’s next?” 
The Colonel was shrilling orders 
now, the roll-call abandoned. Voion 
scurried to and fro in confusion. 

“Let them go. I see they’re not 
bothering with their prisoners.” 

The Voion were streaming away 
down the wide trail in considerable 
disorder, flinging loot aside as they 
went. In two minutes the village 
was deserted, with the exception of 
the ranks of chained Zilk, staring 
fearfully about, and the crumpled 
bodies of their relatives. 

“We’ll go in quietly so as not to 



scare them to death,” Retief said. 
“And remember — the idea is to 
make allies of them, not hors d’oeuv- 
res.” 

F ifty-one Zilk, three of them badly 
dented, had survived the attack. 
Now they sat in a circle among their 
rescuers, shaking their heads mourn- 
fully, obviously still not quite at ease 
in the presence of seventy Ween. 

“Ye warned us, I’ll gi’ 'y e that,” 
one said ruefully. “Never thought 
I’d see the day a bunch of Voion’d 
jump us Zilk, face to face — even 
if they did have us six to one.” 

“The Voion have a new mission 
in life,” Retief said. “Their days 
of petty larceny are over. Now 
they’re after a whole planet ” 
“Well, I guess we fix them, hey 
Tief-tief?” Jik-jik chuckled. “The 
way them babies run, they going to 
need retreads before they gets to 
town.” 

“That was just a minor scuffle,” 
Retief said. “They’re shaken up at 
the moment, but they’ll be back.” 
“You sure enough reckon?” Fut- 
fut executed a twitch of the palps 
indicating sudden alarm. 

“For a stilter what just hit town 
at First Joop, you sure take in a 
lot of ground in a hurry,” Jik-jik 
said plaintively. “If you knowed 
them rascals coming back, how come 
you tell us to mix in in the first 
place?” 

“I thought it would save a lot of 
talk all around if you Ween saw a 
demonstration of Voion tactics first 
hand. Then, too. it seemed worth- 
while to help out the Zilk.” 

“We lost good old Lop-lop,” Jik-

jik pointed out. “His head plumb 
bashed in. He was a good eater.” 
“They lost thirty-five club swing- 
ers,” Retief said. “We’ve gained 
fifty-one new recruits.” 

“What that?” Jik-jik clacked his 
secondary claws with a br-r-rapp! 
“You ain’t talking about these here 
greens-eaters?” 

“Why, ye murderin’ spawn o’ the 
mud devil, d’ye think we Zilk’d have 
any part of yer heathen ways?” one 
of the rescuees hooted, waving his 
scythe. “Ye can all — ” 

“Hold it, fellows,” Retief said. 
“If it comes to a fight with the city 
boys, you tribes will stick together 
or lose. Which will it be?” 

“Where you get an idea like that, 
Tief-tief? They always been a few 
Voion sneaking around, getting they 
antennae in — ” 

“Just before I arrived here, Ikk 
declared himself proprietor of the 
planet. If the rest of you are good, 
he promises to make you honorary 
Voion.” 

There was a chorus of indignant 
buzzes and hoots from Ween and 
Zilk alike. 

“Well, I’m glad to see an area of 
agreement at last,” Retief said. 
“Now, if you Zilk are recovered, 
we’d better be pulling out.” 

“What about our crop?” Tupper 
protested. “It’s all ready to harvest!” 
“This here grass?” Jik-jik con- 
temptuously plucked a wide golden 
leaf from the row beside him, waved 
it under his olfactory organ. “Never 
could figure out what a Quoppina 
thinking of, all the time nibbling 
leaves . .” 

He paused, sniffed at the leaf 



again. Then he bit off a piece wiA 
a sound like a sardine can being 
torn in two, and chewed thought- 
fully. 

“Hey,” he said. “Maybe us been 
missing something. This plumb 
good!” 

Fut-fut snorted his amusement, 
plucked a leaf and sniffed, then bit 
“Hoo!” he announced. “Taste like 
prime Flink. Dog if it- don’t!” 

In a moment, every Ween in sight 
was busily sampling the Zilk greens. 

“Don’t s’pose it matters,” a Zilk 
grumbled. “We’ll never get the crop 
in any way, with those Voion rob- 
bers on the loose.” 

“Don’t worry about that,” a Ween 
called. “Us’ll have these here greens 
in in ten minutes flat!” 

Jik-jik nodded, still masticating. 
“Maybe us Ween and you Zilk could 
work together after all,” he said. 
“Us’ll do the fighting and you fel- 
lows grow the greens.” 

R etief, Jik-jik and Tupper watch- 
ed by the trail as the last of 
the grubs were carted away by ner- 
vous mothers to shelter in the deep 
jungle along with the village pots 
and pans, and the newly harvested 
alloy-plants. Suddenly Tupper point- 
ed. 

“Look up there,” he boomed. “A 
flight of Rhoon — big ones! Com- 
ing this way!” 

“Scatter!” Retief called. “Into the 
woods and regroup on the trail to 
the north!” 

Ween and Zilk darted off in every 
direction. Retief waited until the 
lead Rhoon had dropped to almost 
treetop level, heading for a landing

In the village clearing; then he faded 
back into the shadows of the jungle. 

One by one ten great Rhoon set- 
tled in, their rotors flicking back 
glints of Jooplight as they whirled 
to a stop. In the gloom, small, dark 
figures moved: Voion, filing out 
from between the parked leviathans, 
formed up a loose ring among the 
deserted huts, fanning outward. 

“Come on, Tief-tief,” Jik-jik said 
softly. “If them Rhoon wants the 
place I say let ’em have it.” He 
broke off. “Look there!” he hissed. 
“Voion — swarms of ’em — wheel- 
ing right under them big babies’ 
snappers!” 

“They got here a little sooner than 
I expected,” Retief said softly. 
“They must have already set up a 
field HQ nearby.” 

“Tief-tief, you know what I’m think- 
ing? I’m thinking them Voion and 
them Rhoon is working together! 
But they can’t be! Ain’t no tribe 
never worked with no other tribe, 
not since the Worm’s first Wiggle!” 
“The Ween and the Zilk got to- 
gether,” Retief pointed out. “Why 
not the Voion and the Rhoon?” 

“But that ain’t fair, Tief-tief! 
Ain’t nobody can fight a Rhoon! 
And they always been such peace- 
able babies. Just set on their moun- 
tain top and leave the flat lands to 
us!” 

“It seems they’ve changed their 
ways. We’ll have to fall back. Spread 
the word to the troops to move off 
— and keep it quiet.” 

“Sure is getting dark fast,” Jik- 
jik commented nervously. “Us Ween 
figure it bad luck to move around 
in the dark of Joop.” 



“It’ll be worse luck if we stay 
here. They’re forming up to sweep 
this stretch of jungle clear.” 

“Well — if you says so, Tief-tief,” 
Jik-jik conceded. “I’ll spread the 
word.” 

H alf an hour later, the party 
paused on the trail, in total 
darkness now. 

Tupper was peering through the 
blackness. “I’d give a pretty to know 
where we are,” he said. “Stumbling 
along a trail in the dark— -’tis no fit 
occupation for a sane Quopp.” 
“We’ll have to call a halt until 
Second Jooprise,” Retief said. “We 
can’t see where we’re going, but 
neither can the Voion. They’re not 
using torches either.” 

“But I can hear ’em. They’re not 
far behind us — the night-crawling 
heathen!” 

“It’ll be Second Jooprise in an- 
other half hour, maybe,” Jik-jik said. 
“I hopes them Voion is as smart as 
we is and set still for a while instead 
of cooking up surprises.” 

“I don’t like it,” Tupper stated. 
“There’s something about this spot. 
I get a feeling hostile eyes are on 
me!” 

“They’ll be hostile clubs on you, 
if you keeps talking so loud,” Jik- 
jik said. “Hush up now and let’s 
all set and rest whiles we can.” 
Tupper was moving carefully 
about in the darkness. “Oh-oh,” he 
said softly. 

“What that?” Jik-jik demanded 
“It feels like . .” 

“What it feel like?” Jik-jik asked. 
“Tief — better give us a light,” 
Tupper said tensely.

IF 




Retief stepped to his side, took 
out a lighter, fired a torch sup- 
plied by a Ween. The oily brand 
flared up, cast dancing light on a 
purplish-gray mound blocking the 
path. 

“Was there something?” a deep 
voice boomed out. 

“Now we is done it,” Jik-jik 
choked out. “Us is right smack dab 
in the middle of Jackooburg!” 

VII 

A t once, a dozen torches flared 
ahead; Retief looked around at 
a sprawling collection of wide mud 
and leaf sheds spotted at random 
under the shelter of a grove of vast 
green-barked nicklewood trees. 

There was a wide yard, beaten to 
concrete smoothness by heavy 
wheels. About it were parked a 
dozen massive, low-slung creatures, 
five feet at the shoulder and ten 
feet long, with dusty magenta back 
plates, foot-thick rear wheels a yard 
in diameter, and a pair of smaller 
wheels forward, evolved from the 
lower pair of arms. The upper arms, 
flexible and spade-tippoi, were 
coiled under the wide, flat, duck- 
billed heads. 

“Well?” the same voice, like 
heavy syrup, insisted. “I hope you 
have some excuse for bursting in on 
our nightly contemplation hour!” 
“Just leaving, big boy.” Jik-jik 
spun his wheels backwards, raising 
dust that roiled in the torchlight. 

With a rumble, a pair of Jackoo 
wheeled to cut off retreat. Another 
pair gave low honks, took up posi- 
tions flanking the intruders on the 



left. More Jackoo appeared from 
the darkness and still more emerged 
from shelter among the trees ring- 
ing the yard. 

“Not in such a darned hurry* 
skinny-wheels,” the Jackoo purred. 
“Before I roll you out into a pretty 
orange mg. I’d like to know what 
you thought you could snitch here." 

“I’m looking for a missing party 
of Terrans,” Retief said. “Have you 
seen them?” 

“Terrans? What on Quopp are 
those?” 

“A type of stilter. They look a 
little like me, actually, except that 
they have tender skins.” 

“Hmm. Sounds tasty. Tell you 
what; whoever catches them first 
divvies up with the others, all right?” 

“They’re not to be eaten,” Retief 
corrected. “I want them whole.” 

“Oh, greedy, eh?” More Jackoo 
rolled to complete the encirclement. 

“Oh-oh,” Jik-jik twittered. “Us 
surrounded.” 

“That’s fine,” Retief said. “Now 
we won’t have any Voion sneaking 
up on us.” 

CC'T'ief-tief, us don’t want to 
A tangle with those boys,” Jik- 
jik hissed. “They is tough custom- 
ers. They ain’t fast on they wheels, 
but when they starts it take a moun- 
tain to stop ’em. They flatten what- 
ever they meets!” 

“Good. They’ll make excellent 
heavy armor.” 

“Tief-tief, you is got strange ideas. 
These Jackoo ain’t got a friend in 
the jungle. They grubbers, and they 
don’t care what kind they gets.

"Maybe we can offer them a 
change of diet.** 

“If you have any last words, bet-

closing in. 

“You boys is got wrong ideas.” 
Jik-jik crowded against Retief. “Us 
just dropped in to say howdy. I 
mean, us figured — I mean Tief-tief 
figured — ” 

“What he means is,” Tupper am- 
plified hastily, “the dub-swinging 
rogues ha’ carried out a dastardly 
attack on Zilk Town, and — ” 

“And you boys is next,” Jik-jik 
added. “So—” 

“Heavens, one at a time!” the 
Jackoo bellowed. “Gracious, a per- 
son can’t even hear himself think! 
Now, let me get this straight: Just 
which of you is offering what others 
for sale?” 

“The cute one with the long 
stilts,” a Jackoo suggested from the 
background. “He’s the owner, and 
these other two — ” 

“Nonsense, Fu-fu! The sour-look- 
ing one owns the squatty one, and 
the stilter is some kind of a flack — ” 

“You’re both wrong,” a third 
hollow voice chimed in. “The little 
jumpy one with the big bitey thing 
obviously — ” 

“Gentlemen.” Retief held up both 
gauntleted hands. “I wonder if 
you’ve noticed a small conflagration 
in the near distance?” 

“Gracious, yes,” the Jackoo 
named Fufu said. “I thought it was 
morning and woke up hours early!” 

“A large party of Voion calling 
themselves Planetary Police have 
raided Zilk Town. They’ll be here 
next.” 



“Well, dandy! Maybe they’ll have 
some succulent grubs for sale.” 

“This isn’t like last time,” Retief 
said. “They’re not small-time free- 
lance bushrangers any more. 
They’ve incorporated as a govern- 
ment and gone into the wholesale 
end. They start off by levying a 
modest hundred percent property 
tax. After collecting that, they draft 
the survivors into government serv- 
ice, in what capacity we haven’t yet 
determined.” 

“Ummm, no.” The nearest 
Jackoo thumped heavy palps togeth- 
er in the gesture of Invitation De- 
clined. “We’re content as we are, 
living our peaceful, contemplative 
lives, bothering no one — ” 

“What about all them grubs you 
steals?” Jik-jik put in. 

“Well, if you’re going to get 
picky . .” 

“What Fufu means is that we 
don’t want to sign up for the pro- 
gram,” a Jackoo explained. “Natur- 
ally, we think enterprise is ducky, 
but—” 

“It’s not exactly an invitation,” 
Retief said. “More of an ultimatum. 
Your village is on their route of 
march. They should be here by First 
Jooprise.” 

“Well, they’ll just have their 
trouble for nothing,” Fufu snorted. 
“Having one salesman call is one 
thing, but whole squads of them is 
simply out of the question!” 

“Sure is glad us settle this thing 
when us did,” Pim-pam said heatily. 
“Now us better disappear in a hur-

“Gentlemen,” Retief called, 
“you’re all talking like idiots. They 
have us hemmed in on all sides. 
There’s only one way to get out of 
this trap — and that’s fight our way 
out.” 

“How in the world did we get 
mixed up in this, Fufu?” a Jackoo 
boomed. “Why don’t we just mash 
these noisy creatures and get back 
to sleep?” 

“Listen at them,” Jik-jik said. 
“They ready to quit! Only us Ween 
doing any fighting talk. Too bad 
we is got to sneak off with the 
rest of them — ” 

“Ween, ha!” Tupper shrilled. 
“Tief-tief’s no Ween.” 

“He a honorary Ween,” Jik-jik 
said sullenly. 

“We’re wasting time arguing,” 
Retief said. “If we hit them hard, 
we can punch our way through. 
They won’t be expecting attack.” 

“I’ve got an idea,” Fufu said. 
“Since Tief-tief is the one who wants 
to start trouble, why doesn’t he go 
do it alone? Then in the confusion, 
the rest of us can just steal away.” 

“Hey, that not a bad idea.” Jik- 
jik nodded judiciously. He eased 
over beside Retief. 

“This you big chance to impress 
me,” he whistled. “Not only will 
you hog all the glory, but if you 
gets annihilated, nobody miss you. 
What you say?” 

“Very well,” Retief said. “I’ll 
lead the attack — if you’ll permit me 
to sit on your back, Fufu — and if 
the rest of you will follow my lead.” 



“Well ... us Ween is fighting 
sons of guns,” Jik-jik said. “But 
seeing as them Zilk done pooped 
the party . .” 

“It was you Ween started this 
talk o’ desertion,” Tupper honked. 
“We Zilk will stick as long as any 
o* ye — if you go first, Tief.” 

“That’s settled, then,” Retief said. 
“Sharpen up your cuttng edges, 
everybody, and we’ll see what we 
can do.”

vy er,” Jik-jik said almost en- 
viously, eyeing Retief, sitting astride 
Fufu. “You sticks up there like you 
was welded on. Can’t no fellow with 
wheels manage that trick.” 

“Get ready!” Retief called. Brush 
was stirring across the yard. A big, 
tall Voion rolled into view, a jewel 
glinting in one palp. He crossed his 
upper arms, propped the lower ones 
on what would have been hips in a 
vertebrate. 

“You, there!” he shrilled in Tribal 
dialect. “This village is under arrest! 
Now, all of you Jackoo lie down 
and roll over on your backs. And if 
you happen to catch those out-of- 
town agitators under you, so much 
the better!” 

Fufu’s oculars, plus both pairs of 
antennae, snapped erect. “What did 
he say?” 

“He wants you to lie down and 
play dead,” Retief explained. 

“A Jackoo lie down? He must 
be having us on,” the great creature 
honked. “Once a Jackoo is off his

this about, but since we’re allies 
now — ” 

“I know; he can’t get up again.” 

“Well?” the Voion colonel 
shrilled. “You have exactly one min- 
ute to do as you’re told, or my 
troops will fire the underbrush and 
burn you and your village into 
slag!” 

“These huts of yours; they burn 
pretty well, don’t they, Fufu?” Re- 
tief inquired. 

“Well, we do use magnesium- 
bearing leaves for our roofs. They’re 
light and easy to manage.” 

“What we going do now, Tief- 
tief?” Jik-jik demanded. “Them 
salesmen means business.” 

“They’ve formed up a nice en- 
velopment all the way around posi- 
tion,” Retief said. “And they have 
all the strategic advantages. That 
leaves it up to us to score a tactical 
victory.” 

“What them words mean?” a 
Ween demanded. 

“They mean the Voion have us 
outnumbered, outgunned, and out- 
flanked — so we’ll have to beat the 
wheels off them in a fashion they’re 
not expecting.” 

“How we going do that?” 

“Just be patient another ten sec- 
onds,? Retief said soothingly. 

The glow of approaching Joop- 
rise was bright in the east. Abrupt- 
ly the fast-moving body leaped into 
view, a vivid edge of greenish light 
that swelled into a white glare as 
the great disk swept upward. 

Retief drew his sword, pointed it 
at the Voion. 

“Let’s go, Fufu,” he said. The 
Jackoo leader gave a mighty honk, 



and with a surge of power lunged 
into motion, his tribesmen at his 
back. 

R etief could see leaves tremble 
on the trees ahead as the 
ground shook to the charge of the 
forty multi-ton Quoppina. For a 
startled moment, the colonel stood 
his ground. Then he backed, spun, 
shot into the underbrush a scant ten 
yards ahead of Fufu. 

Retief ducked as his mighty 
mount thundered in among the 
trees. Leafy branches whipped aside 
with a screech and clatter of twisted 
metallo-wood. A polished Voion 
flashed into sight, gunned aside 
barely in time, whirled to thrust a 
bright lance-head at Retief, who 
struck it aside, heard a screech cut 
off abruptly as the Jackoo in line 
pounded across the spot where the 
invader had stood. More Voion were 
in sight ahead now, scattering before 
the avalanche of Jackoo. There was 
a loud twang ! and a heavy arrow 
glanced off Retief s chest armor, 
whined away over his shoulder. Fu- 
fu slammed full tilt into a six-inch 
tree, bounced it aside as though it 
were a bundle of straw, veered 
slightly to miss a two-foot trunk, 
flushed a Voion who darted ahead, 
tripped, disappeared under Fufu’s 
blind charge. Two Voion popped up 
at once, levelling lances; Retief 
crouched low, struck one spear 
aside with his sword point, saw Fu- 
fu’s grubber knock the other flying. 

Behind and on both sides a heavy 
orashing of underbrush attested to 
the presence of other units of Feder- 
ation heavy armor charging in line

abreast. Above, leaves jingled and 
clanged to the passage of moving 
bodies. Reflected Joop-light winked 
from the accoutrements of half-con- 
cealed Voion. 

“Wheel” Fufu hooted. “This is 
perfectly thrilling! I never thought 
I'd be charging into battle with a 
generalissimo sitting on me!” 

“Just be sure I’m still in place 
when you charge out again,” Retief 
instructed. 

A portable searchlight winked on 
ahead, silhouetting scurrying Voion 
against a bluish haze as they rushed 
to form up a defensive line against 
the thunder of the approaching at- 
tackers. 

“Oh, that’s lovely,” Fufu panted. 
“I can see them better now!” 

The Voion ahead were dashing 
ftither and thither, each seemingly 
reluctant to hog the glory of plac- 
ing himself in the path of the on- 
coming enemy. 

“Swing to the left now,” Retief 
called. A Voion shot across the path 
ahead, whirled, brought a hand-gun 
up as Fufu veered to slam the gun- 
ner under his wheels. Two more 
Voion popped up, leaped aside, gave 
despairing yelps as Fufu’s flankers 
steamrollered them. Fufu was run- 
ning parallel to the Voion front 
now, fifty feet inside the beseiging 
line, half a dozen yards behind a 
tribesfellow. ' Voion were racing 
alongside the turf-pounding line, 
loosing off arrows which clacked 
harmlessly off Jackoo armor. One 
shot in close, fired at Retief, who 
ducked, thrust with the sword, saw 
the Voion wobble wildly, go over, 
bounce high and slam into a tree. 



The crashing of metallo-chitin un- 
der horny wheels was like the thun- 
dering of a heavy surf, punctuated 
by belated screeches of alarm as the 
Voion rear ranks caught glimpses of 
the doom rushing down at them. 
Spears arced up, falling as often 
among the Voion as among the re- 
bellious tribesmen; blasters fired 
wildly, and here and there a club 
swung in a vain blow at a racing 
Quoppina. Then suddenly Fufu was 
through the main body, slamming 
past astonished rearguardsmen who 
gaped, dithered, fired too late. 

“Swing left!” Retief called. “May- 
be we can isolate this bunch!” 

N ow the Jackoo raced parallel to 
the outer fringes of a sizable 
detachment of the foe, cut off from 
the main body. Behind them, the 
Ween and Zilk who had made their 
dash trailing close along the lanes 
opened up by the heavyweights 
charged on, disappeared into the sur- 
rounding forest in hot pursuit of the 
demoralized main body. 

Locked in a solid mass of entan- 
gled wheels, the entrapped herd cut 
off by the rebels battled hopelessly 
to retreat. Those who eluded the 
freight-train column and fled to the 
shelter of the woods seemed to dis- 
appear abruptly as soon as they 
reached cover. 

The Voion captives were now 
compressed to the consistency of a 
single interlocked traffic jam, 
screeching mournfully and huddling 
back from the patrolling heavy- 
weights. 

“Hold it up, Fufu,” Retief called. 
The Jackoo puffed to a halt, wheez-

mg heavily. His tribesmates follow- 
ing his lead, closed ranks, buzzing 
and humming, radiating heat like 
big purple boilers. The ensnarled 
Voion squalled, drew even closer to- 
gether as the mighty creatures stared 
at them, their sides heaving from 
the run. The few Planetary Police 
still mobile darted to and fro, then 
threw down their weapons and hud- 
dled against their embattled fellows. 
Behind Retief, the concealed combat 
teams emerged from the brush, 
snappers snapping, scythes waving. 

“Fall out for a ten-minute break, 
gentlemen,” Retief addressed his 
fighters. “They’ll be back in a few 
minutes; but with about three hun- 
dred cops in our custody, we may 
find the opposition in a mood to 
talk terms.” 

4 4'T'ief-tief, I got to hand it to 
A you,” Jik-jik stated. “Our 
plan work out pretty good! Us leave 
a trail of wide, skinny policemens 
all the way back to where Jackoo- 
burg use to be!” 

“Used to be?” Jackoo heads 
turned. 

“Sure. What you think that smoke 
is?” 

“Why — they wouldn’t dare!” 

“Never mind,” Jik-jik said. “It 
wasn’t much of a place anyhow. 
But Tief-tief — like I says, you is a 
credit to honorary Weenhood. Only 
thing I don’t see is, how come you 
won’t let us get on with breaking 
them Voion down into bite-size? 
Way they jumbled up, it take ’em 
six months to figure out whose 
wheels belongs to which.” 

‘This bunch we’ve rounded up is 



just a small part of the Voion 
army,” Relief pointed out. “We’ll 
get the maximum use from them as 
negotiating material. But not if 
they’re disassembled.” 

“Hey, Tief-tief!” A Ween who 
had been posted as look-out hurried 
up, pointing skyward. “Some kind 
of flying wagon coining!” 

Retief and the others watched as 
a foreign-made hell settled in near- 
by. A small undernourished-looking 
Voion with an oversized head low- 
ered himself from the cockpit, un- 
furled a white flag and approached, 
moving unsteadily on wheels of 
which several spokes were flapping 
loose. 

“All right, let him come. And try 
to remember not to remove his head 
before he gets here,” Retief cau- 
tioned. 

“You are Tief-tief the rebel com- 
mander?” the newcomer called in a 
curiously weak voice. 

Retief looked the envoy over 
carefully, nodded. 

“We, ah, admire your spirit,” the 
Voion went on. “For that reason 
we are considering offering you a 
general amnesty . 

Retief waited. 

“If, er, we could discuss the de- 
tails in private?” the emissary pro- 
posed in a hoarse whisper. 

Retief nodded to Jik-jik and Tup- 
per. “Would you fellows mind step- 
ping aside for a minute or two 7” 

“Okay, Tief-tief. But keep both 
oculars on that customer; he look 
to me like a slick one.” They moved 
off a few yards. 

“Go ahead,” Retief said. “What's 
your proposition?”

The Voion was staring at him; he 
made a dry rasping sound. “Forgive 
my mirth,” he hissed. “I confess 
I came here to salvage what I 
could from a debacle — but that 
voice — those legs . The Voion’s 
tone changed to a confident rasp: 
“I have just revised my terms. You 
will relinquish command of this 
rubble at once and accompany me 
as a prisoner to Planetary Field 
HQ!” 

“Why,” Retief inquired interest- 
edly, “would I do that?” 

“For an excellent reason. In fact, 
for ten excellent reasons, my dear 
Retief!” The Voion reached to its 
head, fumbled — then lifted off a 
hollow head-piece to reveal a pale 
gray face and five inquisitive eye- 
stalks. 

“Well, General Hish of the Groa- 
ci Legation,” Retief said. “You’re 
out of your territory.” 

Hish fixed two pairs of eyes on 
Retief. “We have in our custody the 
person of ten Terry females, re- 
moved from a disabled vessel illegal- 
ly on Voion soil,” he said coldly. 
“They are scheduled to be shot at 
dawn. I offer you their lives in re- 
turn for the surrender of yourself.” 

IX 

4 4 T X Then you coming back, Tief- 
▼ V tief?” Jik-jik inquired wor- 
riedly. “How come you going off 
with this here policeman in this here 
apparatus?” 

“I’ll be back as soon as I can,” 
Retief said. “Keep up the hit and 
run tactics — and recruit every tribe 
you meet.” 



‘To get aboard,” the disguised 
alien said in Groaci. ‘To make 
haste to arrive before the execu- 
tions.” 

Retief stepped into the two-man 
heli in which the emissary had ar- 
rived. The latter strapped in, start- 
ed up, lifted from the wheel-scarred 
field, then turned in the seat and 
cocked three unoccupied eyes on 
Retief. 

“I congratulate you on your wis- 
dom in coming along quietly,” he 
whispered in excellent Terran. “I 
of course disapprove of bloodshed, 
but without the compelling argument 
which your presence at Planetary 
HQ will present, I fear my protests 
would never have availed to pre- 
serve intact the prisoners.” 

“You still haven’t told me what 
a Groaci military man is doing out 
here in the brush, General.” 

“Please — address me merely as 
Hish. My Voion associates know me 
only as a helpful civilian advisor. If 
my voice is to be effective in secur- 
ing clemency for the captives, no 
complicating new elements must be 
introduced into the present rather 
fragile equation.” 

“For a group enjoying the serv- 
ices of a high-powered military ad- 
visor,” Retief said, “the Planetary 
Army shows a surprising ignorance 
of the elements of warfare.” 

“I’ve only just arrived in the field 
today,” Hish said. “As for these 
native levies — hopeless. But no mat- 
ter. In the absence of your restrain- 
ing presence your irregulars will 
doubtless devise a suitable disposi- 
tion for them. The survivors, if any, 
will perhaps have learned a lesson

IF 




or two from the experience which 
will stand them in good stead dur- 
ing coming campaigns under my 
tutelage." 

There was a heavy satchel on the 
floor by Retiefs feet, its top gaping 
open. “I see you’re taking a prac- 
ical view of matters,” Retief com- 
mented. He studied a dull-glinting 
shape inside the bag. “I confess I’m 
curious as to just what it is you 
Groaci expect to net from the op- 
eration.” 

As he spoke, he reached casually 
and lifted out the inert form of a 
two-inch Quoppina, a harsh yellow 
in color, remarkably heavy. Beneath 
it he saw another, similar trophy, 
this one a soft silvery color. He re- 
placed the dead specimens. 

“Shall we say — new customers?” 
Hish whispered, staring ahead at 
the jungle below. 

“The prospect of opening up a 
new market for your usual line of 
hardware isn’t sufficient inducement 
to launch a hard-headed group like 
yourselves on a risky adventure un- 
der the collective CDT nose.” 

“Ah, but perhaps the new Plan- 
etary Government, sensible of the 
close ties binding them to the 
Groaci state, will spurn continued 
intervention in internal affairs by 
reactionary Terran influences.” 

“Booting the Terries is part of 
the deal, eh? There’s still something 
you’re not being perfectly candid 
about, Hish. What’s in it for the 
Groaci?” 

“One must keep a few little se- 
crets,” Hish chided. “And now I 
must give my attention to landing. 
Such an awkward business, laboring 



under the weight of this bulky dis- 
guise. Still, it’s necessary; the rank 
and file of my associates seem to 
suffer from the sort of anti-foreign 
animus so typical of bucolics.” 

T here were lights below, the dark 
rectangles of tents, the raw 
scars of hastily scraped camp streets, 
packed with the hurrying ant-shapes 
of Voion. To one side of the field 
headquarters, Retief saw a rank of 
parked Rhoon, unnaturally still as 
technicians crawled over them un- 
der the glare of portable poly arcs. 

The heli dropped in to a bumpy 
landing. At once it was surrounded 
by Voion nervously fingering weap- 
ons. Hish replaced his headpiece, 
opened the hatch and scrambled out. 
An officious-looking Voion staff of- 
ficer bustled up, gave Retief a 
hostile look. 

“Who’s this, Hish-hish?” he de- 
manded. “Their truce representa- 
tive, I suppose?” 

“By no means, Xic,” Hish whis- 
pered in his weak Groaci voice. “In- 
struct your chaps to keep a sharp 
eye on this fellow. He’s my prison- 
er.” 

“What do we want with more 
prisoners — and a stilter at that? I’ve 
already suffered a number of nasty 
dents from the legs of those Terry 
cows you insisted we bring in.” 
“Enough, Xic! I’ve had a trying 
evening.” 

“What did you manage in the way 
of truce terms? I suppose they’re 
demanding outrageous reparations 
for those few trivial villages that ac- 
cidentally caught on fire.” 

“On the contrary, they demand

nothing. I left them to their own 
devices. Now — ” 

“What about our troops? Those 
rabble are holding an entire brigade 
of highly polished soldiers immob- 
ilized out there! Why, the cost of 
the inlays alone — ” 

“The fortunes of war, my dear 
Major. Now, if you please, I have 
important matters to discuss — ” 
“What’s more important than sal- 
vaging my brigade?” the outraged 
officer shrilled. “How can I be ad- 
jutant of an organization that’s been 
scrapped by the enemy?” 

“A neat problem in administra- 
tion, sir. Possibly you could carry 
them on your morning report as 
‘Missing in Action*.” 

“Hmmm. That might work — at 
least until next payday. Meanwhile, 
why not disassemble this stilter and 



get on with planning our next vic- 
tory?” 

“This stilter will play an important 
part in that happy event, Xic. He 
happens to be the rebel command- 
er.” 

“Him?” Xic canted his oculafs 
alertly at Retief. “How in Quopp did 
you manage to capture him?” 

“I have a certain skill in these 
matters. Bring him along now to my 
tent.” 

“Not until the prisoners are re- 
leased,” Retief said. “I want to see 
them put aboard a couple of helis 
and on their way.” 

“What’s this? A prisoner dictat- 
ing terms?” Xic keened. 

“No matter; the wenches have 
served their purpose. I had in mind 
ransoming them off for concessions 
from the Terry Ambassador, but the 



74 



IF 




present arrangement has a certain 
euphony. Go along to the stockade 
and see that they’re released at 
once.” 

“I’ll go with you,” Retief said. 

“You’ll do as you’re ordered!” 
Major Xic snapped. “Or I’ll shorten 
those stilts of yours by a joint to 
bring you down to a more man- 
ageable size!” 

“No, you won’t. You’ll carefully 
keep me intact and reasonably well- 
pleased with things. Hish-hish would 
like it that way.” 

“We’ll indulge his fancy for the 
moment, Major,” the Groaci hissed. 
“Kindly lead the way.” 

T he Voion clacked his palps an- 
grily and rolled off toward a 
stoutly palisaded enclosure looming 
above the lines of low tents along 
the company streets. 

At a heavy gate made of stout 
,logs welded together a guard pro- 
duced a foot-long key. He opened a 
huge padlock, hauled the portal 
wide, then shouted to a compatriot 
above. Lights sprang on at the cor- 
ner towers. Xic motioned a squad 
of Voion through, then followed, 
Hish close on his heels, Retief and 
an additional squad behind him. 

There was an outcry ahead. Four 
Voion shrilled simultaneously, an 
effect not unlike the vocalizations 
of mating cats, though magnified. 
The Voion around Retief jerked up 
ther clubs. iHsh darted ahead. Retief 
pushed after him, came up beside 
the Voion officer who was waving 
all four arms and swiveling his oc- 
ulars excitedly while the soldiers 
peered about the thirty-yard square 



enclosure, all explaining at once. 

“Where are the Terrans?” Hish 
whispered. “What have you done 
with my prisoners?” 

“Quiet!” the major shrieked. He 
turned to Hish, assuming a nonchal- 
ant angle of the antennae. 

“Too bad, Hish-hish,” he said air- 
ily. “It appears they’ve excavated a 
tunnel and departed.” 

“It was the one with the copper- 
colored cranial filaments,” a guard 
explained. “It demanded digging 
tools so that it and its fellows could 
eplivate the ratesifrans . .” 

“What’s that?” Hish demanded. 

“I don’t know!” the major yelled. 
“Something to do with a tribal ta- 
boo. And if you think my boys are 
going to call down the wrath of the 
Worm — ” 

“Beware . lest you call down 
a more immediate ill-temper,” Hish 
snarled. He calmed himself with a 
visible effort, turned on Retief. “An 
unexpected development. But the 
females appear to be free, just as 
you desired.” 

“Not exactly,” Retief cut him off. 
“I desired to see them turned loose 
with a fighting chance of getting 
across a hundred miles of jungle and 
back to Ixix.” 

“Ah, well, life is filled with these 
trifling disappointments, my dear 
Retief. Suppose we go along to my 
tent now and proceed with busi- 
ness.” 

“Thanks, but I won’t be able to 
make it,” Retief said affably. “I 
have to be getting back to the 
wars.” 

“Be realistic, Retief,” Hish urged. 
“My end of the bargain was ful- 



RETIEF'S WAR 



73 




filled in a rather informal manner, 
true, but surely you are not so 
naive as to imagine that detail nul- 
lifies the spirit of our agreement?” 
Hish asked. 

Retief glanced at the looming 
stockade walls, the Voion ringing 
him in. “What spirit would that 
be?” 

“One of cooperation,*’ Hish pur- 
red. “I suggest we move along from 
these depressing surroundings now 
and conduct our little chat in more 
comfortable circumstances.” 

“I’m afraid you’ve gotten a couple 
of false impressions along the line 
somewhere,” Retief said. “I just 
agreed to come with you. I didn’t 
promise to do your homework for 
you.” 

“Surely the supplying of certain 
information was implicit in your sur- 
render!” 

“Why natter with the scoundrel?” 
the .Voion major put in. “I have 
specialists on my staff who’ll put 
him into a talking mood!” 

“Don’t be tiresome, Retief,” Hish 
whispered. “I can squeeze the truth 
out of you; but why force me to 
these uncouth tactics?” 

“Oh, maybe I have an idea you 
don’t know just where I stand, and 
that you’re a little reluctant to dam- 
age CDT property.” 

“What’s he talking about?” the 
Voion demanded. “What has this to 
do with interloping Terries?” 
“Silence!” Hish snapped. “Go 
busy yourself with executing the 
slackers responsible for the escape, 
or some other routine task!” 

“Who do you think you’re talking 
to?” the major keened. “Some head- 



quarters goldbrick sent you out here 
to poke around and count paper 
clips, but if you think you can talk 
that way to me and get away with 
it—” 

“Calm yourself, Major! I should 
dislike to employ my influence with 
Prime Minister Ikk to have you 
transferred to duty on certain other 
fronts!” Hish turned back to Retief. 
“You will now give me full par- 
ticulars on rebel troop concentra- 
tions, or suffer the consequences!” 

“Suppose we just jump directly 
along to the consequences,” Retief 
proposed. “It will save time all 
around.” 

“As you will, then.” Hish turned 
back to Xic. “Since your stockade 
has proven inadequate to require- 
ments, what other facilities can you 
offer for the restraint of the pris- 
oner?” 

“Well — there’s a nice little room 
behind post headquarters, specially 
built to house the officers’ stimu- 
lant supply. If we ever get any. If 
it’s good enough to keep my klep- 
tomaniacs out of the Hellrose, it 
ought to keep this stilter in.” 

“Very well,” Hish snapped. “Take 
him there and chain him to the 
wall.” 

T he cell was a cramped, low- 
ceilinged chamber with damp 
mud walls retained by log pilings. 
Only the upper foot of them were 
above ground level. Through the 
narrow openings between uprights, 
Retief could see the muddy polyarc- 
lit acres of the camp stretching a 
hundred yards to the nearest jungle 
perimeter. 



76 



IF 




The crowd of Voion who had 
escorted him there crowded in, 
watching as the head jailor shook 
out a length of tough chain. He 
welded one end to a projecting stub 
on an ironwood corner post then 
approached Retief. 

“Just sit quiet now, stilter,” he 
ordered, “while I throw a loop 
around your neck. And no backchat, 
or I’ll weld your mandibles shut.” 

“How about putting it on my left 
stilt instead?” Retief proposed. 
“That way it won’t interfere with 
my thinking nice thoughts about 
you, just in case my side wins.” 

“Confidentially,” the welder said 
in a low voice, “just how strong 
are you boys?” 

“Well, let’s see,” Retief consid- 
ered. “There are four billion Quop- 
pina on Quopp. Subtract one mil- 
lion Voion, and that leaves — ” 

“Wow!” a gaping guard said. 
“That’s better’n two to one, pretty 
near!” 

“Shut up, Vop!” the warder 
buzzed. “Stick out that stilt, stilter!” 
Retief complied watched as the 
Voion threw two loops of stout 
chain around his ankle, welded the 
links together. 

“That ought to hold you until 
Hish-hish gets through arguing with 
the major and comes down to 
work you over,” the Voion snapped 
off his portable welder. “If you 
need anything, just yell. The exer- 
cise’ll do you good.” 

“What time is breakfast served?” 
Retief inquired. 

“Oh, I’ll throw a couple slabs of 
overaged Dink in to you after a 
while — if I think of it.” The guards 



filed from the cell, taking their 
torches with them, the warder bring- 
ing up the rear. He looked back 
from the door. 

“That bad?” he queried. “Four 
billion of youse?” 

“Worse,” Retief agreed solemnly. 
“Some of us vote twice.” 

X 

T here was silence after the door 
clanked shut. Along the narrow 
gap between the top of the exca- 
vation and the sagging log ceiling 
half a dozen inquisitive Voion faces 
were ducked down, staring in at the 
dark pit. They saw nothing, so they 
tired of the sport and rolled off to 
other pastimes. 

Retief picked a relatively dry spot, 
sat down, quickly unsnapped the 
leather-soled foot-covering from his 
chained leg, pulled off the shoe, then 
unbuckled the greave-like shin ar- 
mor, worked it out from under the 
loops. A moment later his leg was 
free. He resumed the leg- and foot- 
pieces, shook out the chain and ar- 
ranged a slip-noose for use in the 
event of sudden callers, then scout- 
ed the small room. The metallo- 
wood posts were deep-set, six inches 
apart. He chipped at one with the 
clawed gauntlet on his right hand. 
It was like scratching at a fireplug. 
The airspace above the wall was 
hardly more promising; the clear- 
ance under the ceiling was no more 
than eight inches, and the gap be- 
tween verticals hardly a foot. 

A movement beyond the barrier 
caught Retief’s eye. A pattern of 
glowing, greenish dots danced in the 



RETIEFS WAR 



77 




air a few yards distant, bobbed, 
came closer. 

“Tief-tief!” a tiny voice peeped. 
“Tief-tief caught-caught!” 

“Well, you know my name.” 
Something small and bright green 
buzzed through the opening, hover- 
ing on three-inch rotors. 

“Save-save George-George,” the 
tiny flyer said. “Tief-tief pal-pal!” 

Retief held out his hand. The six- 
inch Quoppina — a Phip — settled 
on it, perched like a jeweled orna- 
ment, its head a deep-green, its short 
body a brilliant chartreuse with 
forest-green stripes, its four straw- 
thin legs a bright sunshine yellow. 

“Phip-phip help-help,” it stated in 
its tiny voice. 

“That’s a very friendly offer,” 
Retief said. “There might be some- 
thing you could do, at that. How 
about rounding up a couple of your 
friends and see if you can find a 
few things for me . .” 

R etief studied the six-foot-long, 
two-foot-deep trenche he had 
scooped in the stiff clay of the cell 
floor, rimmed on one side by a low 
parapet heaped up from the exca- 
vated material. 

“That will have to do,” he said 
to the half dozen Phips who perch- 
ed along the sill, watching the pro- 
ceedings. “Old Hish will be hot- 
footing it down here any time now 
to see if durance vile has softened 
me up.” 

A last flight of Phips buzzed in 
through the wall openings, deposited 
their bean-sized contributions in the 
small heaps laid out on a mat of 
leaves flown in for the purpose. 



“All-all,” one hummed. “Gone- 
gone.” 

“That’s all right,” Retief assured 
the small creature. “I’ve got enough 
now.” He lifted a wide leaf heaped 
with shredded bark selected by the 
Phips for its high cellulose content, 
placed it beside the fox-hole. “Some- 
body give me a light,” he called. 

A Phip settled in, struck its rear 
legs together with a sound like a 
file on glass. At the third try a spark 
jumped. Retief blew, gently on it, 
watched as the fuel glowed, burst 
into a bright green flame. He cov- 
ered the small blaze with another 
broad leaf; yellowish smoke boiled 
out. He held the damper in place 
until the low-oxygen combustion was 
complete, then lifted it to reveal a 
double handful of black residue. 

“That ought to do the job; now 
let’s prepare the rest of the ingre- 
dients.” 

He picked up a rough-surfaced 
slab of ironwood previously split off 
a post, began grating sour-balls into 
a fine powder. 

H alf an hour later, Retief packed 
the last pinch of the finely 
divided mixture into the container 
he had improvised from nicklewood 
leaves, carefully wrapped with 
lengths of tough wire-vine. He crimp- 
ed down the top, inserted a fuse 
made from a strip of shirt-sleeve 
impregnated with the home-made 
gunpowder. 

“Now, when I give the word, light 
it off,” he instructed the hovering 
Phips. “Just one of you. The rest 
will have to stand back at a good 
distance. And as soon as it’s lit —

IF 




head for the tall timber. Fast. Don’t 
wait around to see what happens.” 
“Kay-kay, Tief-tief,” a Phip 
chirped. “Now-now?” 

“In just a minute.” He hefted the 
bomb. “A good pound and a half; 
that ought to have a salutary ef- 
fect.” He placed the rude package 
on the ledge against an upright, 
pressed it firmly in position, then 
packed clay around it, leaving the 
fuse clear. 

“That’s it,” he said. He stepped 
into the trench, settled himself face 
down. 

“Light it off, fellows. And don’t 
forget to hightail it.” 

There was the busy humming of 
small rotors, then a harsh rasping 
as the selected Phip struck a spa^k. 
A brief sputtering followed, accom- 
panied by the hasty whine of the 
departing Phip, then silence. 

Retief waited. He sniffed. Was 
there a faint odor of burning rag?” 
The boom! lifted Retief bodily, 
slammed him back against the floor 
of his retreat under an avalanche of 
mud and screaming wood fragments. 
He thrust himself clear, spat dirt, his 
head ringing like a giant gong. There 
was a harsh stink of chemicals, a 
taste in his mouth like charred 
sneakers. Cool air blew from a gap- 
ing cavern where the wall had been. 
A timber sagged from above it, and 
he could see smoke swirling in a 
room littered with shattered lumber. 

„ A Phip buzzed close. “Fun-fun,” 
it shrilled. “Gain-gain!” 

“Some other time,” Retief said 
blurrily. “And remind me to use 
smaller amounts.” 

He ducked under the fallen ceil- 



ing beams, went up the blast-gouged 
slope, emerged into the open. Voion 
shot past him, inaudible in the shrill 
ringing in Retief’s ears. Out of the 
smoke haze, the slight figure of 
General Hish appeared, arms wav- 
ing. 

Retief straight-armed the Groaci, 
saw him go end over end, one arti- 
ficial wheel bouncing free to go 
rolling off into the brush. He sprint- 
ed, dodged a pair of Voion who be- 
latedly skittered into his path and 
plunged into the dark wall of the 
Jungle. 

XI 

T he trail left by the fleeing pris- 
oners was not difficult to fol- 
low. Bits of lacy cloth, dropped han- 
kies, candy wrappers, and the deep 
prints of spike heels served to in- 
dicate their direction of flight as 
plainly as a set of hand-painted 
sign-posts. 

The girls had pushed through 
dense thickets for a hundred yards, 
then encountered a well-defined trail 
leading in an approximately west* 
ward direction. It was now after 
Second Jooprise, and Retief moved 
along in multi-colored gloom be- 
neath towering trees of a thousand 
varieties, each bearing metal-bright 
leaves in gay tones, which rustled 
and tinkled, clashing with soft mu- 
sical notes as the arching branches 
stirred to the wind. 

Half an hour’s walk brought him 
to a stream of clear water bubbling 
over a shallow, sandy bottom bright 
with vivid-colored pebbles. Small 
aquatic Quoppina the size of Phips 



REN EPS WAR

darted to and fro in the sun-dappled 
water, propelled by rotating mem- 
bers modified by evolutionary pro- 
cesses into twin screws astern. 

The water looked tempting. Re- 
tief hung his sword on a convenient 
branch, lifted off the helmet he had 
been wearing for the past eighteen 
hours, unstrapped the leather side- 
buckles and shed the chest and back 
armor. Then he splashed into the 
stream and dashed cold water over 
his face and arms. Back on shore, 
he settled himself under a mauve- 
barked tree and took out one of the 
concentrated food-bars Ibbl had pro- 
vided. 

From above, a plaintive keening 
sounded. Retief looked up into the 
tree, saw something move in the 
Jooplight striking down through 
branches and glittering dark foliage. 
— a flash of vivid purple among the 
blackish-red leaves. There was a 
second movement, lower down. Re- 
tief made out the almost invisible 
form of a wiry, slender Quoppina, 
gorgeous violet where the light 
struck him, decorated with white- 
edged purple rosettes, a perfect cam- 
ouflage in the light-mottled foliage. 

The creature hung motionless, 
wailing softly. 

Retief jumped, caught a branch, 
pulled himself up, then climbed high- 
er, avoiding the knife-edged leaves. 
From a position astride a stout limb 
twenty feet up, he could make out 
the cleverly concealed lines of a 
narrow-mesh net in which the cap- 
tive — a Flink, Retief saw — hung, 
a tangle of purple limbs, twisted 
ropes, and anxiously canted oculars. 

“What happened, fellow? Pull the 



wrong string and catch yourself?” 
“I’m laughing,” the Flink said 
glumly, in a high, thin voice. 

“So go ahead, gloat,” a second 
Flink voice called from above. “Rub 
it in.” 

“Just a minute and I’ll cut you 
down,” Retief offered. 

“Hey, me first!” the upper Flink 
called. “It was him started the trou- 
ble, remember? Me, I’m a peaceful 
Flink, bothering nobody — ” 

“It’s a different stilter, you low- 
life,” the nearer Flink called has- 
tily. “This ain’t the one from be- 
fore.” 

“Oh, you’ve seen other stilters 
around?” Retief inquired. 

“Maybe. You know how it is. You 
meet all kinds of people.” 

“You’re not being completely 
candid, I’m afraid. Come on — 
give.” 

“Look,” the Flink said. “Such a 
crick I’ve got: How about cutting 
me down first and we’ll chat after?” 
“He's got a crick,” the other Flink 
shrilled hoarsely. “Ha. In his lousy 
net I’m hanging! Six cricks I’ve got, 
all worse than his!” 

“You think this noose is maybe 
comfortable?” the first came back 
hotly. “Rope burns I’m getting — ” 

4 4 T et’s compare notes later,” Re- 
-L' tief interrupted. “Which way 
did the stilters go?” 

“You look like a nice, kind sort 
of stilter,” the nearest Flink said, 
holding his oculars on Retief as he 
swung in a gentle arc past him. “Let 
me down and I’ll try to help you out 
with your problem. I mean, in such 
a position, who could talk?”

“Cut him down, and he’s gone 
like a flash,” the other called. “Now, 
I happen to like your looks, so I’ll 
tell you what I’ll do — ” 

“Don’t listen,” the roped Flink 
said in a confidential tone. “Look 
at him! And he claims to be number 
one tribal woodsman, yet. Some 
woodsman!” 

“A woodsman like you I shouldn’t 
be, even without you was hanging 
in my noose,” the other countered. 
“Take it from me, Stilter, Ozzl’s the 
biggest liar in the tribe, and believe 
me, competition he’s got!” 

“Fellows, I’m afraid I can’t stay 
for a conference after all,” Retief 
cut in. “Sorry to leave you hanging 
around in bad company, but — ” 
“Hold it!” the Flink called Ozzl 
screeched. “I’ve thought it over and 
I’ve decided: A nice fellow like you 



I want my family to meet — ” 

“Don’t trust him! I'll tell you 
what. Get me out of this lousy rope, 
and I’m your Flink.” 

“You expect this stilter — such a 
fine-looking Quopp — he should be- 
lieve that? As soon as I’m loose, 
everything I own is his!” 

“So what’ll he do with a pile of 
empties? My deal is better, believe 
me, Mister. You and me, such a 
talk we’ll have, you wouldn’t be- 
lieve — ” 

“You’re right; he wouldn’t. Him 
and me, together a long chat we’ll 
have — ” 

There was a flash of green, a 
sharp humming. 

The Fhip was back, hovering be- 
fore Retief’s face. 

“Tief-tief flip-flip,” it chirped. 
“Flip-flip Flink-flink!” 



RETIEPS WAR

“Don’t listen!” Ozzl screeched. 
“What does this midget know?” 
“Flip-flip Flink-flink!” 

“Hmmm. I seem to remember 
hearing somewhere that a Flink’s 
word is good as long as he’s stand- 
ing on his head,” Retief mused. 
“Thanks, partner.” He gripped Oz- 
zl’s lower arms — in his species spe- 
cialized as landing gear — and in- 
verted the captive tree-dweller. 

“If I cut you down, will you tell 
me where the stilters are?” 

“Okay, okay, you got me,” the 
Flink chirped glumly. “Cut me down 
and the whole miserable story Fll 
give you.” 

R etief extracted a similar promise 
from the second Flink. 

“Look out, now,” the latter cau- 
tioned. “All around is nets.” 

Retief made out the cleverly con- 
cealed lines of other nets and 
nooses, some small, some large 
enough to gather in a fair-sized 
Quoppina. 

“Thanks for the warning,” Retief 
said. “I might have walked right in 
to one of those.” 

Five minutes later both captives 
had been lowered to the ground and 
cut free. They sprawled, groaning, 
working their arms and experimen- 
tally revving up their rotating mem- 
bers — small pulley-like wheels 
which they customarily hooked over 
vines or branches for fast travel. 

“Well,” Ozzl sighed. “Me and 
Nopl, first class trappers we’re sup- 
posed to be. Such a picture, the two 
of us in our own ropes hung up!” 
“Nothing’s busted,” Nopl said. 
“Boy, such an experience!” 



“Don’t stall, gentlemen,” Retief 
said. “The time has come to tell 
all. Where did you see the sitters, 
how long ago, and which way did 
they go when they left?” 

“A promise is a promise. But lis- 
ten — you won’t tell, okay?” 

“I won’t tell.” 

Ozzl sighed. “All right. It was 
this way . 

((Qo I turn around, and zzsktt! 

O The stilter the others called 
Fi-fi pulls the trip wire. Such a 
dummy I was to explain it. And 
there I am, downside up. It was 
humiliating!” 

“Under the circumstances, a little 
humility seems appropriate,” Retief 
suggested. “And after the stilter 
tricked you into your own net, what 
then?” 

“Then the two-timer cuts down 
the rest of the stilters. And off they 
go thataway.” Ozzl pointed. 

“Yeah,” the other Flink said ag- 
grievedly. “So there we hung until 
you come along. And all because we 
try to be polite and show that stilter 
how the nets work, such an interest 
it was expressing.” 

Retief nodded sympathetically. 
“We stilters are a tricky lot, espe- 
cially when anybody tries to violate 
our tribal taboo against being eaten. 
And on that note I really must leave 
you.” 

“What’s the rush?” Nopl demand- 
ed. “Stick around a while; a little 
philosophy we’ll kick around.” 

“What about a drink, fellows?” 
Ozzl proposed. He took a hip-flask 
from the flat pouch strapped to his 
lean flank, quaffed deeply, rose to 



82 



IF 




his full three foot six, flexed his 
arms. “A new Quopp that’ll make 
out of you,” he announced and pass- 
ed the bottle to Retief. 

He took a swallow. Like all Quop- 
pina liquors, it was thin, delicately 
flavored, resembling dilute honey. 
He passed the flask to Nopl, who 
drank and then offered sulphurous 
sourballs which Retief declined. 

“They’re a good two hours ahead 
of me,” he said. “I have to make 
up some time.” 

The Phip was back, buzzing 
around Retief s head. 

“Tief-tief,” the Phip hummed. 
“Nip-nip!” 

“Sure, give the little stool-pigeon 
a shot.” Nopl offered. “Whoopee! 
Life is just a bowl of snik-berries!” 

“My pal, Tief-tief!” Ozzl slung 
one long, pulley-wheeled member 
across the lower portion of Retief s 
back in comradely fashion. “You're 
a shrewd dealer for a . a . 
whatever kind of Quoppina you 
are!” 

Nopl took another pull at the 
flask. ‘Tief-tief, you should meet 
the crowd,” he shrilled cheerfully. 
“A swell bunch, am I right, Ozzl?” 

“Such a swell bunch, I’m crying,” 
the Flink replied. “When I think 
what a swell bunch they are I won- 
der, what did I do to deserve it?” 

“They’re a lousy crowd teetotaling 
small-timers, but so what?” Nopl 
caroled. ‘Tief-tief they should meet.” 

“Sorry,” Retief said. “Some other 
time.” 

Ozzl made a noise like a broken 
connecting rod, the Flink expression 
of suppressed merriment. “Guess 
again, Tief-tief,” he carolled, and 



waved a wheeled member in an all- 
encompassing gesture. “Meet the 
boys!” 

Retief glanced upward. From be- 
hind every leafy branch and vine- 
shrouded shrub, a purple Quoppina 
materialized, a rope or net in hand, 
a few nocking arrows to small bows, 
one or two armed with long, flexible 
tridents. 

“About time,” Nopl said and hic- 
cupped. “I thought you boys would 
never show!” 

R etief stood in the center of the 
patch of open, Jooplit sward 
beneath the big tree from which a 
hundred silent Flink hung like gro- 
tesque fruits. An overweight Flink 
with the wine-purple carapace of 
mature age tilted myopic oculars at 
him. “These two loafers I send out, 
they should check the traps, and 
with a drinking buddy they come 
reeling back,” he commented bitter- 

iy- 

“Who’s reeling? Am I reeling? 
Look at me,” Ozzl invited. 

“What about the stilter?” some- 
one called. “He looks like prime 
stock. With a cheese sauce, maybe 
he should be served.” 

“My pal, Tief-tief, nobody cuts 
up! First I’ll drop dead!” 

“This I could arrange,” the old- 
ster cut him off. “Now, if we slice 
up this stilter, a snack for everybody 
he’ll make.” 

“Stop right there,” Nobl shrilled. 
“A businessman like Tief-tief we 
couldn’t eat! Cannibalism, it would 
be! Instead, we’ll truss him up and 
sell him. Or maybe disassemble him 
for spares.” 



RETIEFS WAR

Cries rang back and forth as the 
Flink discussed the various propos- 
als. 

“Such a head I’ve got,” Nopl 
groaned during a momentary lull. “I 
think I need another little snort.” 

“That booze of your works fast,” 
Retief commented. “You got through 
the buzz and into the hangover stage 
in record time.” 

“Hung over or no, Ozzl and me 
will stick by you, Tief-tief. If they 
vote to sell you, I’ll put in a good 
word we should hold out for top 
price.” 

“Marked down you’ll not be while 
I’m around,” Ozzl agreed. 

T he elderly Flink emitted a shrill 
cry for silence. 

“The pros and cons we’ve discuss- 
ed,” he announced. “It looks like 
the cons have it.” A rustle ran 
through the Flink ranks. The en- 
circling tribesmen moved in closer, 
shaking out nets and ropes as they 
maneuvered for favorable positions. 
Retief drew his sword, stepped back 
against the nearest tree-trunk. 

“Hey,” the oldster called. “What’s 
that sharp thing? It looks dangerous. 
Put it away before somebody gets 
hurt.” 

“It’s an old tribal custom among 
us stilters that we make owning us 
as expensive as possible,” Retief 
explained. “Who’s going to be first 
to open an account?” 

“It figures,” the elder said judi- 
ciously. “Price supports, yet.” 

“Still, we try to be reasonable,” 
Retief amplified. “I doubt if PH 
disassemble more than a dozen Flink 
before you get a rope on me.” 



“Six,” the Flink said flatly. 
“That’s my top offer.” 

“I’m afraid we’re not going to be 
able to get together,” Retief said. 
“Maybe we’d better call off the 
whole deal.” 

“He’s right,” someone stated. 
“Worth twelve Flink, including may- 
be me, he’s not.” 

Retief started forward, swinging 
the sword loosely. “Just step back, 
gentlemen,” he suggested. “I have 
important business to transact, and 
no time to continue this delightful 
discussion.” 

A noose whirled at him; he spun, 
slashed; the severed line dropped to 
the ground. 

“Hey! That’s expensive rope you’re 
cutting!” someone protested, hauling 
in the damaged lariat. 

“Let him go,” another suggested. 

“What’s that?” the elder shrilled. 
“You want I should let valuable 
merchandise go stilting right out of 
sight?” 

“Listen, Tief-tief,” Ozzl called. 
“There’s only the one trail, and it 
leads straight to the rockspire. Now, 
with us, you get sold for parts, so 
okay, there you are. But you climb 
up there and a Rhoon picks you up 
and flies off — then where are you?” 

“Did you say Rhoon?” Retief in- 
quired. 

“On top of the rock spire they’re 
thick like Phips on a jelly flower. 
A chance you haven’t got!” 

“Still, I think I’ll risk it,” Retief 
said. He moved toward the trail and 
two Flink rushed in, nets ready. 

He knocked them spinning, dodged 
two nets and a lasso, leaped for the 
dark tunnel of the trail and ran for

it with a horde of Flink baying in 
hot pursuit. 

XII 

L ater, on a rocky slope a hun- 
dred yards above the tops of 
the thick jungle growth below, Re- 
tief pulled himself up onto a flat 
boulder. He turned and looked down 
at the Flink tribe clustered below, 
staring up and shaking fists. 

“Dirty pool, Tief-tief!” Ozzl yell- 
ed. “This kind terrain our wheels 
ain’t meant for.” 

“Thanks for escorting me this 
far,” Retief called. “I’ll find my way 
from here.” 

“Sure.” The Flink waved a mem- 
ber at the steep escarpments rising 
above. “Just keep climbing. The 
Rhoon roost is only about a mile — 
straight up. If you don’t fall off and 
get killed, the Rhoon you’ll find 
after a while. Or they’ll find you.” 
He clicked his antennae in the ges- 
ture of Sentimental Farewell. “You 
were a good drinking buddy.” 

Retief scanned the slope above; 
he had a stiff climb ahead. He lifted 
off his helmet, pulled off the gaunt- 
lets, slung them by a thong to his 
belt. He shook his canteen; nearly 
empty. He took a last look at the 
valley and started up the almost 
vertical slope. 

I t was an hour after dawn when 
Retief reached a narrow ledge a 
thousand feet above the Jungle val- 
ley below. The wind whistled here, 
unimpeded by Quoppian flora. In 
the distance, a pair of white flyers 
of medium size wheeled and dipped 



under the ominous sky of approach- 
ing First Eclipse, where the fire- 
edged disc of Joop rushed to its 
rendezvous with the glaring Quopp 
sun. Far above, a mere speck in the 
dark blue sky, a lone Rhoon circled 
the towering peak where the giant 
flyers nested. 

Retief studied the rock-face above. 
It was a smooth expanse of black 
slate-like stone rising sheer from the 
ledge. The route upward, it appear- 
ed, ended here and the Flink waited 
below. 

One of the white aerialists was 
dropping lower, coming in to look 
over the intruder. Retief donned his 
head-piece, shifted his sword hilt to 
a convenient angle, waited for the 
visitor. He could hear the beat of its 
rotors now, see the pale coral mark- 
ings along the underside of the body, 
the black legs folded against the 
chest region, the inquisitive oculars, 
canted to look him over. 

“What seek you here upon the 
wind-slopes, groundling?” a thin 
voice called down to him, tattered 
by the gusty breeze. “There’s 
naught for your kind here but un- 
forgiving rock-spires and the deep, 
cold air.” 

“They say the Rhoon have their 
nests up there,” Retief called. 

“That do they. Up a-high, where 
low clouds scrape their bellies and 
death-blooms grow amid the moss 
as black as night.” 

The flying creature dropped clos- 
er; the slipstream from its ten-foot 
rotors battered at Retief, whirling 
dust into his face. He gripped the 
rock, braced his feet apart. 

“Aiiii!” the flyer called. “If a 



RETIEF'S WAR 



85 




zephyr from my passing can come 
nigh to spill you from your perch, 
how will you fare when some great 
lordling of the Rhoon comes like a 
cyclone to attend you here?” 

‘Til work on that one when I get 
to it,” Retief shouted over the tu- 
mult. 

“If you’ve come to steal my eggs, 
you’ve picked a lonely death.” 

“Is there any other kind?” 

The flyer settled lower, reached 
out and gripped a buttress of rock 
with black talons; its rotors whined 
to a stop. 

“Perhaps you’ve tired of life, 
chained to the world, and you’ve 
come here to launch yourself into 
one glorious taste of flight,” it haz- 
arded. 

“Just paying a social call,” Retief 
assured the creature. “But I seem to 
have run out of highway. You 
wouldn’t happen to know an easier 
route up?” 

“A social call? I see you wish a 
braver death than a mere tumble to 
the rocks.” 

“I’d like to sample the view from 
the top. I hear it’s very impressive.” 

“The view of raging Rhoonhood 
stopping to defend a nest is said to 
be the fearsomest orf Qiiopp,” the 
flyer agreed. “However, few eye- 
witness tales of the experience are 
told.” 

R etief studied the creature’s ro- 
tors, spinning slowly as the 
wind sighed over the thin, curved 
blades. 

“How much weight can you lift?” 
he inquired. 

“I once plucked up a full-grown 



Flink and dropped him in the river 
yonder,” the flyer motioned with 
one limber arm. “I doubt if he’ll 
come thieving ’round my nest again.” 

“I weigh more than a Flink,” Re- 
tief pointed out. 

“No matter that. You’d fall as 
fast as any Flink, and make a better 
splash.” 

“I’ll bet you can’t lift me,” Retief 
challenged. The flyer revved its ro- 
tors, shifting its grip on its perch. 

“Most groundlings plead for life 
when once I catch them on the rock- 
spires. Now you invite my wrath.” 

“Oh, no. I’m just talking about 
flying me up there!” Retief pointed 
to the peaks towering above. 

“Fly you . .?” 

“Sure. I can’t walk up a vertical 
wall, and it wouldn’t be convenient 
to go down and look for another 
route.” 

“Can you be serious, poor earth- 
bound grub? Would you indeed 
trust life and limb to me?” 

“Most Quoppina will keep their 
word to a harmless stranger. Why 
should you be any different?” 

“A curious rationale,” the flyer 
said. “And yet, withal, a most re- 
freshing one. I’d come to think of 
crawlers all as timid things, who 
cling and whimper out their fear 
when I come on them here among 
the lonely peaks. And now here’s 
one who speaks as boldly as a flyer 
born!” 

“Just put me down anywhere in 
climbing range of Rhoon country,” 
Retief suggested. 

“A strange anomaly is this! A 
wingless one who dares to come 
among the masters of the sky!” The 



86 



IP 




flyer whirled its rotors, lifted, drift- 
ed, hovering toward Retief. “I’ll put 
you to the test then, groundling! 
Perhaps you’ll weight me down, and 
then together we’ll go tumbling to- 
ward our death below. But if my 
rotors hold, I'll bear you up — my 
life upon it!” 

“Fair enough.” Retief sheathed 
his sword, squinting against the 
down-blast of air. He reached for 
the steel-hard grapples of the flyer, 
gripped, held on. 

Air screamed as the whirling 
blades raced, biting for purchase. 
Then he was lifting, floating up, 
wind screaming past his face, the 
mountainside dwindling away below. 

T he flying creature rose swiftly 
for a hundred feet; then it 
slowed, gained another fifty feet, 
inched upward, its rotors laboring 
now 

A gust of wind tilted it, and it 
dropped, then righted itself, strug- 
gled upward again, paralleling the 
smooth face of rock at a distance 
of thirty feet, Retief estimated. A 
small white flower growing from a 
crevice caught his eye. Slowly it 
dropped below him as the flyer 
gained altitude foot by foot. Above, 
Retief could see a tiny ledge where 
the vertical face ended, and above 
it a long sweep, only slightly le c 
steep, to a lone spire thrusting up 
another five hundred feet against 
the darkening sky. 

“How say you, groundling?” the 
laboring flyer’s voice rang out. “Will 
you trust me to press on, or shall 
I give it up and place you safe be- 
low?” 



RETIEFS WAR 




“Just a little way now,” Retief 
called. “You can do it, old timer.” 
“I like the groundling’s spirit, 
wings or no!” the Quoppina shouted 
into the wind. “We’ll hazard all . 
and win or die . and none can 
say we quailed before the test!” 
“You’d better save your wind for 
flying,” Retief called. “We’ll stage 
a self-congratulation session after we 
get there.” 

The wind whipped, buffeting. The 
cliff face moved past with agonizing 
sloth. 

Retief’s hands were numb from 
the strain; the ledge was still twenty 
feet above, inching closer. The 
Quoppina’s breathing was loud, 
wheezing. The sound of the rotors 
had changed timbre. They seemed 
to flutter now, as though the blades 
were loose. Then another sound was 
audible — a sharp whirring, coming 
closer . 

Retief twisted his head. A second 
flying Quoppina had come up from 
the port beam. It hovered, studying 
the situation with alert oculars. 

“That one’s too big to eat, Gulin- 
da!” it called. “I’ll wager he’s as 
tough as Wumblum wheel-rim!” 

“I’ll place him . safe above . 
or die . .” Retief s flyer got out. 

“Ah — then it’s a wager! Well, I 
suggest you waste no time. A Rhoon 
has seen you now, and half a min- 
ute hence he’ll be here.” 

Retief’s flyer grunted a reply, set- 
tled down to steady pulling. Ten 
feet more, five, three . 

There was a deep thr umm ing, a 
beat of wind that bounced the flyer 
closer to the cliff-face. Retief cran- 
ed, saw the huge-bodied shape of a 

88 



fast-descending Rhoon silhouetted 
against the vast, glittering disks of 
its spinning rotors. 

With a final, gear-screeching ef- 
fort, the smaller flyer surged up- 
ward the final yard, banked toward 
the ledge. “Farewell!” it screamed. 
Retief dropped, slammed stony 
gfound, fetched up against the rising 
wall above as the Rhoon pounced, 
missing, its fanged eating-jaws wide. 

Retief rolled away as the Rhoon 
struck out with a barbed hind leg, 
missed and struck again, sent stone 
chips flying. A narrow crevice split 
the rock a yard distant; Retief dived 
for it, wedged himself in just as the 
disk of Joop cut off the blackish 
sunlight like a snapped switch. Long 
Rhoon talons raked against the rock, 
sending a shower of bright sparks 
glimmering against the sudden dark. 
Then, with a hoarse scream, the 
Rhoon lifted away; the beat of its 
rotors faded. 

Retief leaned back in his cramped 
refuge, let out his breath with a long 
sigh, alone now with the stars that 
twinkled in the false night of the 
eclipse and the moaning wind that 
searched among the rock crannies. 

R etief rested while Joop edged 
across the bright corona erf the 
distant sun; the glowing halo bulg- 
ed, then burst into full light as the 
transit was completed. 

He scanned the sky. A pair of 
Rhoon circled far above, light flick- 
ing from their rotors. He squeezed 
out of his hideaway, looked over 
the edge of the two-foot shelf on 
which he stood. 

Far below, the ledge from which 

IF 




he had hitched the ride to his pre- 
sent position showed as a thin line 
against vertical rock. And far below 
that, the Jungle stretched like a vari- 
colored carpet across low hills to 
distant haze. 

He looked up. Striated rock loom- 
ed, topped by a rock spire that thrust 
up like a knife blade a final hun- 
dred feet. Retief turned back to the 
cranny in which he had hidden. 

It narrowed sharply into dark- 
ness — but a steady flow of cold air 
funnelled from it. He went to hands 
and knees, pushed through the first 
narrowing, found that the passage 
widened slightly. Above, the sky was 
a bright blue line between the rising 
walls of rock. He rose, crunching 
brittle debris underfoot, braced his 
back against one face of the chim- 
ney, started upward . 

Halfway up, Retief found an out- 
thrust shoulder of rock on which to 
rest. He ate half a food-bar, took 
a swallow of water — the last in his 
canteen. Then he went on. 

Once the cleft narrowed, then wid- 
ened out into a near-cave, from 
which a cloud of tiny gray-black 
Quoppina no bigger than humming- 
birds swarmed in alarm, battering at 
his face and uttering supersonic 
cries. Again, the black shadow of a 
Rhoon swept across the strip of sky 
above, momentarily blanking out the 
meager light. The armor chafed, cut- 
ting into his back; his hands were 
cut in a dozen places from the 
sharp-edged rock. 

The crevasse widened again ten 
feet from the top. Retief made the 
last few yards in a scramble up a 
deeply scored slope half-choked with 



weathered and faded fragments of 
Quoppina exoskeleton and sun- 
bleached organic gears looped by 
tangles of corroded internal wiring. 

The Rhoon, it appeared, were 
messy eaters. 

Keeping in black shadow, Retief 
studied the open sky. A thousand 
feet above, two Rhoon wheeled laz- 
ily, unaware of the intruder in their 
domain. He stood, dusted himself 
off, looked around at an oval plat- 
form fifteen by twenty feet, backed 
at one side by a spear of rock that 
rose ten feet to a needle point, edged 
on the remainder of its periphery by 
a void that yawned across to a stu- 
pendous view of high, lonely peaks, 
only a few of which topped his pres- 
ent vantage point. Closer at hand, 
a heap of round boulders caught 
his eye: Butter-yellow spheres eigh- 
teen inches in diameter. He went to 
them, tapped the' smooth surface of 
one; it gave off a hollow, metallic 
bong. There were six of them — 
Rhoon eggs, piled here to hatch in 
the sun. 

Retief glanced toward the monster 
parents circling above, still appar- 
ently serenely ignorant of his pre- 
sence. 

The big eggs were heavy, un- 
wieldy in their lopsidedness. He lift- 
ed down the topmost spheroid, roll- 
ed it across to the cliffs edge, prop- 
ped it, delicately poised, just above 
the brink. The next two eggs he 
ranged beside the first. Two more 
eggs formed a short second rank, 
with the final orb positioned atop 
the others. Retief dusted his hands, 
resumed the helmet and gauntlets he 
had laid aside earlier, then posted

himself squarely before the gargan- 
tuan Easter display and settled down 
to wait. 

XIII 

A cold wind whipped down from 
the deep blue sky. Retief watch- 
ed the mighty Rhoon elders wheel- 
ing in the distance, tireless as the 
wind — a description which, he re- 
flected, did not apply equally to 
himself. 

Half an hour passed. Retief watch- 
ed the high white clouds that march- 
ed past like gunboats hurrying to 
distant battles. He shifted to a more 
comfortable position leaning against 
a convenient boulder, closed his eyes 
against the brightness of the sky . 

A rhythmic, thudding whistle 
brought him suddenly wide awake. 

A hundred feet above, an im- 
mense Rhoon swelled visibly as it 
dropped to the attack, its giant ro- 
tors hammering a tornado of air 
down at him, swirling up dust in 
a choking cloud. The Rhoon’s four 
legs were extended, the three-foot- 
long slashing talons glinting like blue 
steel in the sunlight, the open biting 
jaws looking wide enough to swal- 
low an Ambassador at one gulp. 

Retief braced himself, both hands 
on the topmost of the pyramid of 
eggs as the flying behemoth dark- 
ened the sun. 

At the last possible instant the 
Rhoon veered off, shot past the peak 
like a runaway air-liner, leaving a 
thin shriek trailing in the air behind 
it. Retief turned, saw it mount up 
into view again, its thirty-foot pro- 
pellors flexing under the massive 



acceleration pressures. It swung in 
to hover scant yards away. 

“Who comes to steal Gerthudion’s 
eggs?” the great creature screamed. 

“I want a word with you,” Retief 
called. “The egg arrangement is just 
a conversation piece.” 

“High have you crept to reach 
my nest, and slow was your pro- 
gress,” the Rhoon steam-whistled. “I 
promise you a quicker return pas- 
sage!” It edged closer. 

“Careful with that draft;” Retief 
cautioned. “I feel a sneeze coming 
on. I’d hate to accidentally nudge 
your future family over the edge.” 

“Stand back, egg-napper! If even 
one of my darlings falls, I’ll impale 
you on a rock-spike to dry in the 
sun!” 

“I propose a truce. You restrain 
your violent impulses, and I’ll see 
to it no accidents happen to the 
eggs.” 

“You threaten me, impudent 
mite? You’d bribe me with my own 
precious Rhoonlets?” 

“I sincerely hope so. If you’ll just 
perch somewhere, I’ll tell you what 
it's all about.” 

“Some reason must there be for 
such madness under the morning 
sun! To hear the why of it, I confess 
I’m curious!” The Rhoon mother 
swung across the platform, settled in 
at the far edge in a flurry of dust, 
clinging to the rock with four joint- 
ed legs like lengths of polished gray 
pipe. Her yard-long head reared up 
a full fifteen feet to stare down at 
Retief, the shadows of her rotors 
flicking across her horny features as 
the blades slowed to a leisurely 
wind-driven twirl.

“Mind you don't twitch now, and 
send what remains of your short 
future tumbling down into the 
abyss,” the huge flyer admonished 
in a voice that boomed like a pipe 
organ. “Now, tell me. Why chose 
you this peculiar means of dying?” 
“Dying isn't exactly what I had in 
mind,” Retief corrected. “I’m look- 
ing for a party of Terrans. Stilters, 
somewhat exactly like me, you 
know.” 

“And you think to find them 
here?” 

“Not exactly; but I have an idea 
you can help me find them.” 

“I, Gerthudion, lend aid to the tri- 
vial enterprises of a planet-bound 
mite? The thin air of the steeps has 
addled your wits!” 

“Still, I predict you'll take an in- 
terest before long.” 

T he Rhoon edged closer, stretch- 
ing its neck. “Your time grows 
short, daft groundling,” she rumbled. 
“Now tell me what prompts you to 
dare such insolence!” 

“I don’t suppose you’ve been fol- 
lowing recent political developments 
down below?” Retief hazarded. 

“What cares * Gerthudion for 
such?” the Rhoon boomed. “Wide 
are the skies and long the thoughts 
of the Rhoonfolk — ” 

“Uh-huh. I’m a long-thought fan 
myself,” Retief put in. “However, 
a brand of mite called the Voion 
have been cutting a lot of people’s 
thinking off short lately.” 

“How could any petty dirt-creeper 
cut short the thoughts of a free-born 
Rhoon?” 

“I’ll get to that in a minute,” Re- 



tief promised. “Is it true that you 
Rhoon have keen eyesight?” 

“Keen is our vision, and long our 
gaze.” 

“And your wind’s not bad, either. 
Too bad you’re too big for a career 
in diplomacy; you could keep a 
round of peace talks going for a 
record run. Now, tell me, Gertie, 
have you noticed the smoke columns 
rising from the forest over there to 
the north?” 

“That I have,” the Rhoon snap- 
ped. “And lucky for you my eggs 
you’re embracing, else I'd tumble 
you over the edge for your imper- 
tinence.” 

“Those are tribal villages burning. 
The Voion are setting out to take 
over the planet. They have very spe- 
cific ideas of what constitutes a 
desirable citizen. No Quoppina who 
isn’t a Voion seems to qualify.” 

“Get to the point!” 

“You Rhoon, not being Voion, are 
going to have to join the fight.” 

“A curious fancy, that!” the 
Rhoon bassooned. “As though the 
lofty Rhoon-folk would stoop to 
such petty enterprise!” 

“I wonder if that keen vision of 
yours has detected the presence of 
a number of Rhoon cruising around 
at tree-top level over the jungle in 
the last few days?” 

“Those did I note, and wondered 
at it,” the Rhoon conceded. “But a 
Rhoon flies where he will.” 

“Does he?” Retief countered. 
‘Those particular Rhoon are flying 
where the Voion will.” 

“Nonsense! A Rhoon, servant to 
a creeping mite who’d not a goodly 
swallow make?” 



RETIEF'S WAR

‘They have at least two squad- 
rons of Rhoon in service now. And 
unless someone changes their plans 
for them, there’ll be more recruits 
in the very near future. You, for 
example.” 

“Gerthudion, slave to a verminous 
crawler on the floor of the world?” 
The Rhoon spun its wide rotor with 
an ominous buzzing sound. “Not 
while I live!” 

“Exactly,” Retief said. 

“What mean you?” the Rhoon 
croaked. “What mad talk is this?” 
“Those Rhoon the Voion are us- 
ing are all dead,” Retief said flatly. 
“The Voion killed them and they’re 
riding around on their corpses.” 

G erthudion squatted on folded 
legs, her stilled rotor canted at 
non-aeronautical angles. 

“This talk makes no sense,” she 
tubaed. “Dead Rhoon, their innards 
to replace with wires imported from 
a factory on another world? Power 
cells instead of stomachs? Usurping 
Voion strapped into saddles in place 
of honest Rhoonish brains?” 

“That’s about it. You Quoppina 
all have organo-electronic interiors, 
and there’s enough metal in your 
makeup to simplify spot welding the 
necessary replacement components 
in position. A nuclear pack the size 
of a fat man’s lunch will supply 
enough power to run even those 
king-size rotors of yours for a year. 
I didn’t have time to examine the 
dead Rhoon I saw in detail, but I’d 
guess they’ve even rigged the oculars 
to a cockpit display screen to take 
advantage of your natural vision. 
Riding their zombies, the Voion can 



probably fly higher and faster than 
you can.” 

‘They’d dare?” the Rhoon burst 
out, vibrating her posterior anten- 
nae in the universal gesture of Pro- 
priety Outraged. “Our airy realm to 
usurp? Our very members to em- 
ploy? Aunt Vulugulei! For a week 
her dainty tonnage I’ve not seen; 
could it be . .?” 

“Quite possibly she’s been fitted 
out with a windshield and rudder 
pedals,” Retief nodded. “And some 
shined-up Voion’s probably sitting 
where her main reactor used to be/ 
carving his initials on her side and 
revving her rotors — ” 

“Enough! No more!” The Rhoon 
waggled her oculars in a dizzying 
pattern. She rose, creaking, on legs 
quivering with emotion, started her 
rotors up. “I’m off, my fellow 
Rhoon to consult,” she called over 
the rising tumult of air. “If what 
you say is true — and I’ve a horrid 
feeling it is — we’ll join in, these 
ghouls to destroy!” 

“I had an idea you’d see it that 
way, Gertie. And don’t forget to ask 
if any of them have seen a party of 
stilters in the Jungle,” 

“Inquire I will; meantime, my 
eggs from that precarious edge with- 
draw. If one should slip, your rag- 
tag horde will lack a leader!” In a 
hail-storm of blown pebbles, the 
Rhoon leaped off, beating her way 
eastward toward a cluster of tall 
peaks. 

R etief turned at the sound of a 
loud scrongg! — like a sheet- 
metal roof being lifted off a shed by 
a high wind. The heap of eggs quiv-

ered. The ripping noise came again; 
a gleaming spike poked out through 
the polished curve of the center 
spheroid in the bottom row, ripped 
a foot-long tear. 

An ungainly shape thrust through 
the opening — a head like a chrom- 
alloy pick-axe equipped with a pair 
of alert eyes which fixed on Retief. 
The beak opened. 

“Quopp!” the fledgling Rhoon 
squalled. “Quopppp!” 

It struggled frantically, snapping 
the impressive jaws, lined, Retief 
noted, with a row of triangular 
razors. A clawed leg appeared, gain- 
ed the newcomer another six inches 
of freedom. As the broached egg 
rocked, those above trembled, then 
toppled — inside the nest! — with a 
crash like spilled milk cans. 

One, badly dented, bounced to a 
stop at Retief s feet. A six-inch split 
opened to reveal a second baby face, 
complete with meat shredders. The 
first Rhoonlet gave a final kick, 
sprawled free of the shell, which 
skidded across the platform, driven 
by the wind, disappeared over the 
side. A third egg gave a jump. A 
bright needle-point punctured its 
side. 

The first of the newborn Rhoon 
was unsteadily on its feet now, try- 
ing out six short, unspecialized 
limbs, claw-tipped, the rear pair 
showing only knobby buds where 
later the rotating members would 
develop — a form not unlike the 
ten-million-year remote ancestor of 
all the Quopp tribes. The hatchling 
wobbled, steadied, then charged, 
jaws gaping. Retief side-stepped, not- 
ing that infant number two was now 



half clear of his prison, while num- 
ber three was surveying the scene 
with interested eyes. Dull clunks and 
clangs attested to activity within the 
other three eggs. 

The eldest infant managed to halt 
its rush just short of the cliff-edge, 
teetered for a moment staring down 
into the awesome depths over which 
it would soar later in life, and back- 
ed away, hissing. Then it remem- 
bered lunch and rushed Retief again 
in time to collide with younger 
brother, freshly on the scene. 

While the two tangled, squalling, 
Retief hastily maneuvered half a 
dozen scattered rocks in place to 
form a rude barricade, stationed 
himself behind it. The argument 
ended as a third young appetite shot 
past the combatants, zeroing in on 
the free lunch. The trio hit the bar- 
rier with a metallic crash, rebound- 
ed, came on again. And now there 
were four. 

The beat of heavy rotors sounded 
above. Gerthudion, flanked by two 
immense males, distinguished by 
gold and red cranial plumes, drop- 
ped in with a tornado of air that 
sent her young slithering and 
squawking across the rocky plat- 
form — and over the edge. 

“Hey!” Retief called. “Your 
kids!” 

The Rhoon settled in. “That’s all 
right; obnoxious creatures, those. It’s 
only the eggs I’m concerned about, 
their hatching to insure. Anyway, 
they’ll be all right. It’s good exper- 
ience. As for the call to war, we’re 
with you — ” 

A small head appeared over the 
edge; scrabbling claws pulled a hun-

gry Rhoonlet up, the others close 
behind. Retief stepped to the giant 
parent, scaled the massive side and 
straddled the back just behind the 
head. 

“Let’s get moving,” he called over 
the pound of idling rotors. “I’m be- 
ginning to share your view of the 
younger generation.” 

“As for your Terries,” Gerthu- 
dion honked, “Lundelia reports he’s 
seen such a group as you describe 
near the village of the Herpp, a few 
miles west.” 

“Then just drop me off there, if 
you don’t mind.” 

The Rhoon leaped into the air, 
the backwash from her pounding ro- 
tors a howling typhoon. 

“I’ll lake you there,” she boomed 
over the uproar. “Then thereafter 
you’ll guide me to these ghoulish 
Voion, my vengeance to wreak!” 

I t was a swift flight from the chill 
altitudes of the rock spires down 
across rolling jungle to the bend of 
the river, where the pinkish copper- 
wood huts of the Herpp nestled in 
the shelter of the trees. 

Gerthudion settled in to a bouncy 
landing on a sand spit where there 
was clearance for her rotors. Retief 
slid down, settled his sword belt into 
position for a quick draw, scanning 
the silent village with its neat wheel- 
ways, orderly flower beds and color- 
ful awnings. 

“Nobody in sight, Gerti. I think 
title inhabitants beat a hasty retreat 
when they saw you coming.” 

“Or mayhap they crouch behind 
their door-posts with drawn bows,” 
the flyer suggested. 



“Yeah, mayhap. I guess there’s 
just one way to find out.” He walk- 
ed across the sand, climbed a grassy 
bank, stood at the end of the village 
street beside a long table heaped 
with bright-colored fruits and frag- 
ments of husk — a task apparently 
hastily abandoned. 

He called, “I am TieMief, and 
I dance the dance of Friendly In- 
tentions.” 

There was a flicker of motion at 
a window. The polished tip of an 
arrow poked into view, followed by 
a pale blue head. 

“I am Nop-Nee, and I dance the 
dance of Fair Warning.” 

“I’m looking for some friends of 
mine,” Retief called. “Don’t let 
Gerthudion bother you. She’s tame.” 
The Rhoon snorted loudly. 

“ — and she won’t eliminate your 
village unless you carelessly initiate 
hostilities by letting fly with that 
arrow.” 

The aimed weapon disappeared. 
The Herpp emerged cautiously from 
the door, the arrow still nocked but 
aimed off-side now. 

“What makes you think your 
friends are here?” he chirped. 

“Oh, word gets around. There are 
ten of them — stilters, you know.” 
“Never saw them,” the Herpp 
snapped. “Now you better get back 
on that monster of yours and dust 
back off where you came from, be- 
fore we clobber the both of you.” 
“Don’t do anything hasty, Nop- 
Nee,” Retief cautioned. “Gerthudion 
is a patient Rhoon, but you might 
annoy her with that kind of talk.” 
“Bah, we’ve seen enough Rhoon 
in the last twelve hours to last us,” 



94 



IF 




the Herpp snapped. “A round doz- 
en of the devils flew over and drop- 
ped stones on us last night. Told us 
to surrender, before they set the 
whole place on fire!” 

“That’s unfortunate,” Retief 
agreed. “But those were outlaw 
Rhoon. Gerthudion’s on her way to 
hunt them down right now.” 
“Then she’d better get started. 
We’ve got catapults and ballistae 
rigged, and by now they’re zeroed 
in and ready to fire. So — ” he rais- 
ed the bow — “scat!” 

“I admire your spirit,” Retief said. 
“But first I want the ten Terrans.” 
Nop-Nee drew the bow-string far- 
ther back. “Not on your life! I’m 
not turning harmless foreigners over 
to the likes of you and your over- 
sized cronies! They’re guests of 
Quopp, and they’ll receive hospitable 
treatment. I am Nop-Nee and I 
dance the dance of Ferocious De- 
fiance!” 

“And I’m Retief and I dance the 
dance of Mounting Impatience — ” 
“You can dance the dance of 
Apoplexy for all I care,” Nop-Nee 
yelped. “Git!” 

Retief cupped a hand beside his 
mouth. “Girls, if you’re in there, 
come on out!” he called in Terran. 
“I’m here on behalf of the Terry 
Embassy at Ixix!” 

T he Herpp jumped back in alarm. 

“Here, I’m Nop-Nee and I 
dance the dance of Confusion! That 
sounded like Terry talk!” 

A door banged wide on the third 
hut in line, and a slim brunette 
Terry female in torn flying togs ap- 



peared. She shaded her eyes at Re- 
tief, while other girls crowded out 
behind her. 

“Ladies, I’m enchanted to find 
you,” he said. 

“Who are you?” the brunette ask- 
ed. She had a snub nose and blue 
eyes and was not over nineteen. “I 
thought I heard a Terran voice.” 
“That was me, I’m afraid. I’m 
known as Tief-tief. I’m here to help 
you.” 

“You’re not from that nasty little 
Voion who locked ui up in a cor- 
ral?” the girl asked. 

“By no means. He and I are con- 
firmed antagonists, ever since I blew 
up his liquor vault.” 

The girls were in a huddle now, 
whispering together. 

“Well,” the brunette said. “I guess 
we may as well take a chance; 
Aphrodisia likes your voice.” She 
smiled and came forward. “I’m 
Rene. It’s very nice of you to trouble 
about us, Mr. Tief-tief.” 

“Girls, now that I’ve located you, 
I can make arrangements to fly' you 
out. I’m afraid Ixix isn’t a healthy 
place for Terries right now, but 
there’s a trading post at Rum Jungle 
where you’ll be reasonably safe for 
the present.” Retief looked over the 
little group, all young, all pretty, all 
showing signs of a difficult day and 
night in the jungle. 

“Which one of you is Fifi?” 

The girls looked at each other. 
Rene bit her lip. “She’s not here, 
I’m afraid. We heard that a rebel 
army was organizing to fight the 
Voion, and she started out early this 
morning alone to try to reach them.”

THE 

LONELY HOURS 

by w. i. McLaughlin 



G eorge Rock felt stomach being 
plastered against spine while his 
ship accelerated into another com- 
puter-guided evasion curve. 

“Georgie-Porgie, you wine-soaked 
fool, you’re getting everything you 
deserve.” 

Self-recrimination couldn’t change 
the past, but it did serve as mental 
fingertapping to keep the spaceship’s 
lone occupant from concentrating 
fully on the thing that was out there 
chasing him. 

The computer ordered the ship 
into a relatively straight line of 
flight. Rock expressed his relief by 
fumbling around in his pocket for 
some matches. He didn’t complete 
the ritual of lighting the dead ciga- 
rette that stuck to his dry lips, but 
rather scanned the external sensor 
indicators. External electromagnetic

and the misery of Man's defeat I 



field strength was uniformly down. 
This together with the continued 
straight flight of the ship indicated 
that the computer had, for the pre- 
sent, successfully evaded the thing. 

Again he lashed himself in ner- 
vous thought. “Light up, idiot. This 
ritay not be your last cigarette after 
all, if you smoke it fast.” 

Rock fed his psycho-web programs 
into the central processing unit of 
the computer, replacing the evasion 
program which had just successfully 
gained him the time to attempt this 
next step in his defense against the 
thing. 

While his ship hurtled toward the 
dead ion laminae that lay ahead, 
Rock allowed himself the luxury of 
relaxing with his cigarette. 

“Lord knows I’ll be busy enough 
when I get to the ion sheets. That 



96 



glorified adding machine can run 
the ship while I finish this ciggy and 
have a drink . The thought of 
alcohol brought a stab of pain from 
his unsatisfied hangover, . of 
goddamn milk.” 

Rock punched the console, getting 
a squeeze bag of milk for his trou- 
ble. In between squirts he worked 
on another cigarette and surveyed 
the situation in preparation for the 
coming battle with the thing. At 
least he hoped it would be a battle 
and not just his execution. 

H e knew that his meeting with 
the thing had been a sport, a 
freak — one of those occurences that 
probability legislates against with a 
“1” followed by an absurd number 
of zeros. But the universe was a 
big place. Astronomical research 
confirmed the 20th Century cosmol- 
ogist Hoyle in his views as to the 
nature of the universe: it was indeed 
infinite in time and space. The uni- 
verse expands away from every one 
of its constituent points. But it 
doesn’t thin out because, as describ- 
ed by Hoyle’s Canonical Creation 
equations of the 1970’s and 1980’s, 
hydrogen atoms continually “ping” 
into existence throughout space. 
Then they cluster together around 
local irregularities and finally boil 
themselves into galaxies with all their 
concomitant structure. 

Laymen and scientists alike could 
never comprehend the vast dimen- 
sions of the universe. A digit fol- 
lowed by a long string of zeroes 
means little to anyone. But if size 
alone was unintelligible, one corol- 
lary of this size was not — the liter- 

THE LONELY HOURS 



ally infinite variety of life in the 
universe. 

If monkeys stabbing blindly at 
typewriters could, given sufficient 
time, reproduce all of the earth’s 
books, then how much more could 
be punched out in a universe of in- 
finite time and space twitching pur- 
poselessly but effectively under the 
stabbings of the laws' of physics. 

Man, through imaginative writings 
and scientific skylarking, was some- 
what prepared for the luxuriance of 
planetary life; almost every non- 
binary star was accompanied by an 
inhabited planet. But biological life 
was just a part of the universe of 
consciousness: the marvelously intri- 
cate hydrodynamic mechanisms of 
the pulsating star Mira exhibited a 
consciousness as far advanced as 
any race of planetary creatures, and 
in interstellar space vast laminae 
sheets of ions bound together by 
electromagnetic glue flexed back and 
forth in intricate patterns of aware- 
ness. 

Rock’s ship sped towards the re- 
mains of one of these ionic laminae. 
Death came inevitably to all life, 
whether man or ordered patterns of 
ions, and the ionic concentration 
that the ship’s sensors had detected 
lying ahead was just a vast electri- 
cally charged corpse shucked off 
from the galaxy that gave it birth to 
drift in intergalactic space. Space- 
ship and pursuer approached this 
corpse for their ghoulish rendesvouz. 

Rock knew that only his nearness 
to the Magellanic clouds had made 
possible the appearance of this drift- 
ing hulk. The cavernous reaches of 
intergalactic space rarely entertain- 
er 




cd any visitors. Only near the shoals 
of a galaxy might evidences of life 
activity be found, excepting of 
course the nameless things that oc- 
casionally blew in from intergalactic 
space — the mad fish from the deep 
ocean. 

“And now, you besotted bard, 
you’ve got one of those little play- 
mates sticking up your exhaust 
pipe.” 

I t happened about six hours ago. 

George Rock, poet and seeker of 
new experiences, had lain wine- 
drugged in his single-seater space 
craft. The object was to get away 
from it all — a quick trip in space 
drive to the absolute aloneness of 
intergalactic space and then, oh thrill 
upon thrill, alcoholic contemplation 
of whatever alcoholic poets contem- 
plate while sitting in deep space. Re- 
covering from these reveries, Rock 
failed to notice the tell-tale indica- 
tions of menace. 

Only when radiation reached 
alarming levels outside of the ship 
did the warning bells sound, awak- 
ening the sleeping man. But by then 
the thing from deep space had 
spread enough of its diffuse self over 
the ship to prevent shifting to space 
drive. Rock knew he had been lucky 
to get the ship moving again at top 
speed in local drive. 

While building up to maximum 
acceleration he had activated the 
psycho-web introductory and explor- 
atory program. The psycho-web re- 
port came out as expected — the 
radiation was organized, sentient, 
and quite mad by all recognized so- 
cial standards. For a creature wan- 



dering endlessly in an abyss totally 
devoid of anything but self what 
else could the result be? 

“Aren’t we mad together. Maybe 
you’re just a great big slobbering 
dog that’s looking for a friend. And 
who could you find out here but 
a madman for a friend?” The re- 
mark was more bravado than humor. 

But the warning mind pressures 
that had come with the creature’s 
first onslaught weren't characteristic 
of man’s best friend. The howling 
madness had sent waves of nausea 
thrilling through Rock’s body as he 
activated evasive procedures. The 
ionic laminae had been spotted ear- 
ly in the chase, and for the last five 
hours the ship had headed for the 
spent corpse, with only occasional 
evasive procedures ordered by the 
computer when the mind pressures 
became unbearable. 

Rock asked the computer for a 
read out. He studied the printed out- 
put. Thoughtfully he laid the sheets 
aside and ordered food. Time 
enough for a tuna sandwich and 
another bag of milk before rapid 
deceleration would begin in the vi- 
cinity of the ion cloud. Using the 
psycho-web to activate the dead ion 
cloud was a desperate measure. But 
after six hours of running and com- 
puting Rock knew that the thing was 
too swift for his craft to outrun in 
local drive. 

R ock was three drags into a ciga- 
rette when deceleration began. 
He was slammed into his couch with 
maximum force and held there 
breathless and gaunt until the ship 
had spent its motion. With shaking 



98 



IF 




hand he took a last drag on his 
cigarette and threw it into the dis- 
posal. He checked over the lights 
on the computer console once more. 
Then as the first hint of the ap- 
proaching madness blew over his 
mind, he injected his arm with som- 
nal and settled back to let the plan- 
ned psycho-web sequence take over. 

Computer circuits clicked on and 
off as the psycho-web absorbed the 
essential features of Rock’s mind. A 
perfect reproduction was then es- 
tablished in the outlying ion cloud 
by the psycho- web projector. Rock 
retained control of half of his pro- 
jected psyche and voluntarily relin- 
quished the other halt, now a tempt- 
ing, unprotected morsel lying out 
there. 

The programmed computer in- 
structed the pscho-web’s environ- 
ment simulator in the rules of the 
upcoming “game”. He knew that he 
must interest the creature in con- 
testing for control of the ion cloud 
complex. The alternative was to sit 
in the ship and absorb wave after 
wave of insane raving. The outcome 
of that would be all too predictable. 

The thing roared over the ship 
and into the cloud. It slobbered and 
drooled over the contact with other- 
ness. , Aeons of aloneness were end- 
ed. It plunged into the cold water of 
experience. After a period of dis- 
oriented orgy its discrimination in- 
creased and it sniffed out the lure of 
Rock’s exposed psyche. The possibil- 
ities for intimacy excited it to a 
frenzy and it merged. 

The ship’s power plant reeled at 
full blast to counterbalance the 
thing’s mind force. The psycho-web 



grew taut and held. The players 
were in place and the drama began. 

T wenty-five yards separated the 
antagonists. The white whale 
twitched its monstrous tail and shot 
forward towards the longboat. The 
snowy-hill plowed through the sea 
with ever-increasing speed, questing 
for the man with the harpoon. 

Captain Ahab braced in the boat. 
With six feet of sharpened steel lie 
faced the apparition bearing down 
upon him. The gap separating man 
and whale closed. 

At the last possible moment the 
whale swerved to avoid a harpoon- 
ing. But Ahab was too close, and 
with a cry he drove the harpoon 
home. 

The new goad of pain spurred the 
whale forward. Rope whizzed from 
Ahab’s longboat in response to this 
spurt. The oarsmen started to turn 
the boat to prepare for a tow chase. 
In the confusion of turning boat 
and speeding line a loop of rope 
snaked about Ahab’s neck, and in 
a flash he was gone. 

Quickly the whale sounded with 
the half-strangled Ahab in tow. In 
victory Leviathan reached for the 
depths. As the blackness closed 
about Ahab a change occurred in his 
features. His strangled purple face 
grew in size, and his lips drew apart, 
exposing yellowed teeth which took 
on the appearance of fangs. The 
struggling whale, for all its size, 
could no longer contrive to pull 
down the now rapidly enlarging 
figure of Ahab. Its plunge was halt- 
ed and it began to rise, tugged up- 
ward by the gigantic Ahab who grew 



THE LONELY HOURS 



99 




Id size with every moment. Soon the 
whale rocketed up through the sur- 
face, not under his ov/n power but 
as a satellite of the engorged Ahab. 

Ahab’s face was a mask of de- 
monic fury. The roaring that filled 
the world was complemented by the 
total madness that poured from his 
eyes. The ocean began to dissolve 
and the blueness of the tropic sky 
darkened to black. The universe was 
melting and coalescing into the 
bloated, screaming Ahab. The whale 
alone remained distinct but was 
dwarfed by the still-growing Ahab- 
thing. 

In intergalactic space, 25,000 light 
years from the Magellanic clouds, a 
twisted sheet of ions flexed in re- 
sponse to an urgent computer com- 
mand. Ahab and the whale vanished. 
The raging thing continued its fury 
in the now unmonitored ion cloud. 
The spacecraft’s power plant went 
into emergency overload to balance 
die rampaging force that threatened 
to consume the whole of Rock’s 
psyche. Then, having been deprived 
of its Ahab-activity-center, the thing 
gradually diffused its energy and 
was content to snuffle about the ion 
cloud. 

Having survived a direct frontal 
assault on its ego, the thing was now 
wary and must be approached by 
more subtle means. The computer 
spun its tapes rapidly, searching for 
a suitable way. Making its choice, it 
activated the environment simulator. 
There was a short wait until the 
thing stumbled upon Rock’s psyche 
again. Having been once burned it 
hesitated momentarily. Then lust 
overrode its newly found prudence, 



and it merged. Once again die psy- 
cho-web grew taut. 

T he morning of the heretic’s exe- 
cution was gray. A light drizzle 
was falling. The heretic had to be 
carried to the stake because his body 
was too broken for him to go under 
his own power. Inquisitor-General 
Oswald Spranger was burning him 
along with eighteen accused witches. 
The Inquisitor-General had instituted 
a reign of terror such as Germany 
had never seen before. 

The Inquisitor-General personally 
saw to it that the heretic was secure- 
ly bound to the stake and had pro- 
perly received the last rites. The 
heretic noted that the faggots heap- 
ed about his feet were composed 
exclusively of green wood. Green 
wood burned hot without a large 
flame and resulted in a much slower 
death. Evidently the Inquisitor-Gen- 
eral’s interest in the execution was 
not exclusively theological. The final 
details having been attended to, in- 
cluding a last minute request for 
recantation of heresy, the fires were 
lit at the heretic’s stake and at the 
eighteen other stakes. 

Soon the air was filled with smoke, 
burning flesh and screams. The 
flames licked about the heretic and 
his face contorted with agony. Fi- 
nally he broke and started scream- 
ing and crying for a quick end. The 
last thing he saw before the smoke 
obscured everything was the gloating 
face of the Inquisitor-General peer- 
ing through the smoke and flames. 

As soon as the burning green 
wood had completely hidden the 
heretic from the onlookers’ sight his 



100 



IF 




agonized features relaxed and he 
broke into a smile. Lord, how all 
this smoke made him want a ciga- 
rette! Well, the quickest way to 
remedy that was to get back to the 
ship. The heretic vanished out of 
existence, leaving slack ropes tied 
to the burning stake, and George 
Rock raised himself from the couch 
in his spaceship. The Inquisitor- 
General would really be incensed 
when he found no bones at the 
stake. He’d be convinced that the 
heretic had also been a warlock. 



Rock hungrily lit a cigarette and 
checked the computer output. As he 
had hoped, the thing was now in 
complete control of the ion cloud 
and no longer needed the psycho- 
web for its fantasies. Rock gently 
eased the spacecraft out of the ion 
cloud. When he was free he shifted 
to space drive and was on the way 
home. At the rate the ion cloud was 
drifting into intergalactic space it 
would be a long way out before the 
thing had burned all the witches in 
Germany. END

Doomsday Men

Illustrated by MORROW 



They delved into the minds of dead Men to 
trap the killers that menaced all Earthl 



I 

I B forty-three and a half seconds 
James McLellan Partridge would 
once again be dead — once more 
murdered. 

Partridge walked now unhurriedly 
through the throng of late evening 
strollers along the brilliantly lit 
boulevard, lackluster eyes seeing the 
profusion of glittery tourist-trap 
trash garishly illuminated behind 
plate glass, ears hearing the muted 
pneumatic thump of suspended traf- 
fic-lanes above, feet feeling the firm- 



ly yielding surface of the pedway 
beneath, nose smelling the subtly 
bracing city scents all about and 
tongue tasting the soothing mentho- 
jell in his mouth. James Partridge, 
like most men, took these appur- 
tenances of modern civilization for 
granted. 

But of all those myriad city dwell- 
ers hurrying about their multi-storied 
catacomb of light and bustle and 
rush, only he — only James McLel- 
lan Partridge — was due to die with- 
in the minute. 

At least, Robin Carver made the 



102 




mental correction, at least for now. 
Other men and women would die 
this night; death was the one final 
incurable disease. But as of this re- 
curring minute James McLellan Par- 
tridge and Robin Carver would 
share that death in so enwrapped 
a symbiosis that for the agonizing 
instant of death each would become 
the other. Carver, too, would share 
that scarlet moment of destruction. 

He didn’t like that. Carver never 
had relished the final moments of 
death when the symbiosis became 
too painful, too poignant. It was in 
that moment that he wondered why 
he did what he did, an instant of 
self-doubt that vanished with the 
stroke of death that set him free. 

Partridge sucked on his mentho- 
jell with the acidulated enjoyment of 
the addict. Stripes of gaudy color 
from shop windows lay athwart the 
boulevard, cutting at right angles 
to the street lighting and lacquering 
tiie faces of passers-by with gay 
chameleon-like changes that served 
to remind Carver only of the pa- 
thetic brilliance of painted mummy- 
cases from the dusty tombs of 
Egypt. 

A narrow service alley between 
stores opened off to the right. It was 
a constricted space, not as well lit 
as the boulevard but still suffused 
with the saffron sheen from animat- 
ed advertisement panels plastering 
the walls with gigantic color and 
movement. Partridge walked at the 
focal point of six differently colored 
and sized shadows as he turned 
down the alleyway to the place 
where he had met his death. 

Twenty seconds to go now. 



As always when death zero ap- 
proached Carver felt the weird in- 
appropriateness of the victim’s un- 
awareness. Despite his knowledge 
that the victim could not know, he 
still cringed as he awaited the im- 
pact. 

A shadow moved in the mother- 
of-pearl radiance of the alley. 

Two shadows, clinging and then 
parting. Opening out. Waiting. Two 
shadows waiting at death zero. 

Partridge looked at them. His dull 
city eyes saw them as people, as 
passers-by, non-personalities that 
were met by the thousand and for- 
gotten quicker than a shower of 
rain. 

Carver looked at them. Carver 
took them into his mind, every 
lineament of them. He treasured up 
every single revealing feature and 
made very sure he would know 
them again. For this he was here. 

T hey were dressed as Withits. 

Sharp, mod, snappy. Carver 
took their incongruous uniform dress 
in with a single all-embracing glance. 

The boy shuffled his feet, his 
face loose and leering, his whole 
posture at once ingratiating and re- 
pellent. 

“Have you a light, citizen? My 
flicker’s dry.” 

“His flicker’s dry,” the girl said, 
the saffron light coating her black 
lank hair. “No selfigs. Gotta light?” 
“Why — a light? Yes.” James Mc- 
Lellan Partridge aroused from 
apathy to a jerky wish to please. 
He began to take out a gas lighter. 
Ten seconds. 

“Now?” said the girl. 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN 



103 




The boy licked his !ips. They 
riione unhealthily. His hand slid 
with the furtive movement of a 
■lake into his pocket. “Sure, Belle,” 
he said. 

“I wanna!” Belle spoke on a 
breath, her chest moving spasmodi- 
cally, her face pinched and yet 
alive, vibrant. “Let me — you pro- 
mised!” 

“What was that?” said Partridge, 
the lighter extended in his right 
hand. 

Three seconds. 

“Aw — all right, Belle” 

Her eyes showed the rapacity of 
a rat. 

“Thanks, Marv! Thanks a trillion! 
This is the kick I crave!” 

And still Partridge held his light- 
er out on his palm. Still he stared 
at the two Withits, still he had no 
inkling of what was to happen in 
. in — 

One second. 

Belle lifted her short skirt. The 
flash of the shiv against the white 
of her thigh above the tan stock- 
ing at last got through to Partridge. 

He dropped the flicker. He took 
a half step back. His right hand 
spread, lifting, the fingers opening 
Kke a fan. 

Carver felt his brain trying to 
move muscles that did not belong 
to him. He automatically wanted to 
fall into a fighting crouch, take the 
knife away from the girl and not 
bother overmuch if he hurt her 
doing it . 

Partridge hasn't a clue how to 
defend himself ! 

“Go on. Belle! He’ll yell any 
mimite!” 



Marv pushed at the girl’s shoul- 
der and she surged forward, her 
black hair falling across the left side 
of her thin face. Her eyes glinted 
in the saffron light. 

The point of the knife struck a 
star of brilliance into Partridge’s 
eyes. He blinked. He didn’t even see 
the knife as it clove forward. 

But he felt it. 

Carver, of course, could not see 
the knife, either. 

The feel of the knife going in 
nauseated him. The sensation ef- 
fectively blocked out Partridge’s, he 
could not feel the sharp shrill of 
pain biting into Partridge. Partridge 
opened his eyes for the last time, 
his mouth open and bubbling and 
forming words that did not come. 
The boy and girl, Marv and Belle, 
the Withits, were looking down on 
him. The bloodied knife hung in the 
air before Partridge’s graying vi- 
sion. The Withits gloated. Pink ton- 
gues licked stained lips. A sheen of 
sweat glistened on their foreheads. 
An intense absorption in the final 
death agonies of this man they had 
murdered concentrated in their faces, 
screwing them up, tightening them, 
turning them into the semblances of 
satanic, satiated evil. 

James McLellan Partridge fell to 
the ground. He fell exactly at death 
zero, where he had been found. 

Confused random impressions and 
sensations struck at Robin Carver. 
This was always a moment of great 
but dangerous fascination. He saw — 

But he had no concepts to explain 
even wordlessly to himself what it 
was he saw as Partridge died. Part- 
ridge’s eyes closed and he was dead;

and the blackness came thankfully 
for Robin Carver. 

H e opened his eyes as the tech 
bent down to detach the sens- 
ing lobes from his temples. The 
lobes slid away gently and with them 
went death and terror and the near- 
blasphemous resurrection not of life 
but of death. 

“You’re back again, sir.” The tech 
smiled. “Just lie still for a moment. 
Breath steadily . .” 

Marjie, the tech, was young and 
blonde and shapely. She slid the 
sensing lobes from James McLellan 
Partridge’s temples where he lay on 
the second pallet, lax and limp 
awaiting the onset of rigor mortis, 
a man past caring about the gray 
worries of his gray life. She let them 
coil back on their leads to the hooks 
on the front cover plate of the 
equipment banked against the walls 
of the hovervan. The sensing lobes 
snapped into place alongside the 
pair that had enwrapped Carver’s 
head. 

“He was just a Zombie — ” Car- 
ver said, and paused. 

That had been the wrong word to 
use. Partridge had been a non-per- 
sonality; but the word zombie had 
come to have a very special mean- 
ing to the men and women on the 
R.I.D. Even then he was making a 
mistake, thinking of the Force as 
R.I.D. “Ridforce” they were to the 
rest of the police departments and 
“ridforce” they must remain. 

Cy Adams shoved the connecting 
door to the lobby of the van open 
and strode in, his round face beam- 
ing and his shock of wiry Wack hair 



bouncing with the violence of hk 
movements. 

“You’re back, Robin! Good. 
Good. Everything’s set up outside. 
Just let me have a look at you.” 

Adams, as the unit’s psychiatrist 
and general father confessor, must 
by regulations check a returning op- 
erator first. Even now, with ridforce 
well into its second decade of opera- 
tions, the unknown still encompassed 
them and tripped them up. Carver 
lay back and let Adams go ahead. 

“Where were you born?” 

‘The Old Oast, Brenchley, Kent 
Poor Partridge didn’t have much 
time before he died — ” 

“When?” 

‘Twenty-sixth August, eighty-nine. 
And you didn’t send me a card last 
birthday.” 

“Thought you’d reached the time 
of life when you’d want to stop 
counting. Was Partridge married?" 

“Yes. And take it easy with the 
old age sympathy — I’m only ap- 
proaching the forties.” 

“You seem in command, Robin. 
But — but I don’t know. What hap- 
pened to your wife? Your wife?” 

“She ran — hey, now, wait a min- 
ute!” 

“What happened to your wife* 
Robin?” 

“She ran away.” 

Mere simple statements in an- 
swer to straight questions couldn # t 
suffice now; asked to prove that he 
still regarded himself as Robin Car- 
ver, prodded by questions until a 
lid popped, he spoke on feverishly. 
“She ran off. After we’d been mar- 
ried eighteen months. With a satel- 
lite electronics engineer. Left me

holding the baby. Her name, you 
want? I*fl tell you the name of the 
conniving, snivelling, deceitful lit- 
tle—” 

Adams held up a hand, quite un- 
alarmed by the outburst. “That’s 
enough, Robin. Easy, lad, easy . .” 

Carver slowed down. He put a 
hand to his cheek, a hand that 
trembled. “Sorry, Cy. Silly of me to 
blow my top like that. Just, some- 
how — ” 

“I know, old son. Forget it. You 
had a raw deal out of life but you’re 
over it now. All I want right now 
is to know that you still are Robin 
Carver. No, not that, exactly. You 
are Robin Carver, of course. We 
must be sure you know that, too.” 
Adams reached down a hand and 
pulled Carver off the pallet. “Come 
on. They’re waiting. I know you 
only had a short trip. But that, 
strangely enough, is a very good 
reason for quizzing you that extra 
bit more.” 

Carver stood up and reached 
across to the peg for his jacket. 
“Oh?” 

“Sure thing. Sometimes these short 
trips give an operator the biggest 
kick of all. Disorientation is so sub- 
tle it can strike unnoticed. After 
you.” 

They walked out into the lobby 
and through to the interrogation 
van. 

C arver stepped into a bright, ac- 
tinic light falling across the 
desk and chair, the easel, the ident- 
books, the filing cabinets and map, 
the radio equipment. Soames, Detec- 
tive on Watch, looked up, his hard 



craggy face intent beneath tufty 
gray eyebrows. “D’you see him, 
Robin?” 

“Yes. Two of them — boy and 
girl. Withits.” 

“Oh, for gosh-sakes!” Soames 
pushed his hat back and looked his 
disgust. “Not them again!” 

At his side Rawlinson, second de- 
tective, stared at the polished floor 
of the van, skimpily carpeted. “If 
it’s not the Withits, it’s the Slashers 
— or a dozen other stupid and vi- 
cious teen-age status symbol organi- 
zations. They all should be stuck 
against a wall and shot.” 

“Well, now, Charlie . .” Soames 
was the father of a teen-age boy and 
girl, children born late in his mar- 
riage. Quite clearly Carver could see 
the battle going on in Soames’ opin- 
ions. “Seems there are teen-agers 
and teen-agers.” 

Charlie Rawlinson said: “Your 

kids are okay, Bob. You know that. 
I know that. But these Withits now, 
petty thugs — ” 

“Not so petty,” Carver interrupt- 
ed. He sat down at the easel. “Not 
now. The two Withits murdered 
Partridge.” He began to draw with 
a deft light touch. “Two. Boy and 
girl. Marv and Belle. Belle asked 
Marv if she could do it and Marv 
agreed. They acted like he was 
doing her a great favor allowing her 
to murder the man. He wanted to 
do it himself, that was clear. But 
she asked him and he let her, just as 
though she’d asked if she could rida 
his hover scooter for the kicks.” 

His eidetic memory brought up 
fact after fact and channeled them 
through to his eyes and fingers, 

ISP 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN 




wrought Belle’s and Marv’s images 
on the paper. He sat back. “There 
they are. Pitiful pair, yes? But they 
really enjoyed pushing that knife 
into Partridge’s guts.” 

“Why’d they kill him, Robin?” 
asked Soames. 

“If I said no reason I’d be wrong. 
But there was no reason that makes 
sense to a policeman seeking a mur- 
derer with a motive he can under- 
stand. But Cy would know.” Carver 
paused, thinking back to that mo- 
ment of death zero in the saffron- 
sheened alley. This is the kick l 
crave ! Belle had said. 

“They did it,” he said at last, 
slowly, “they did it for kicks.” 

heir reaction surprised him. 
Rawlinson made a short sound 
of disgust. 

Soames leaned back in his chair, 
tapping the pencil against his nose. 
“It’s beginning to add up. And the 
picture is a nasty one. Sour. Some- 
thing Whitcliffe has been worrying 
about for weeks. This last one only 
confirms the picture.” 

“You mean there have been other 
murders like this?” 

“Killing for kicks,” said Soames. 
“Death for a giggle. Pretty, isn’t it?” 
“My God,” said Carver. 

As an operator for rid force his 
job was ostensibly done as soon as 
he had identified the murderer ahd 
given his colleagues all the informa- 
tion he could. His was not the task 
of hunting down the murderer. The 
ordinary police did that as they had 
always done: only now they hunted 
with the sure knowledge of who 
they hunted. If the victim had 



looked at his killer — then the po- 
lice would know him too. 

If the victim had no sight of his 
murderer then the ridforce operator 
would have to pick up everything he 
could from the murdered man’s 
background, fit all the tiny pieces 
together, watch and wait there in 
the dead man’s mind, integrating a 
life — and a death. Carver happen- 
ed to be very good at that job. But 
he still couldn’t explain how he had 
been corralled into it in the first 
place. 

Up until recently the murder sta- 
tistics had been growing more fa- 
vorable. But now these last senseless 
murders had the police chasing teen- 
agers, chasing their tails, trying to 
comprehend what was going on as 
well as stopping its results. 

The hovervan cleared away and 
Cy Adams spoke briefly to Carver. 
“You’re off watch now, then, Rob- 
in? Alec Durlston is your relief and 
he’ll be—” 

“Yeah. I know Durlston is my 
relief.” 

The bitterness in his voice made 
the others look up. “He’s always 
late!” 

“We all know what Durlston is,” 
Soames said gruffly. “But just hold 
on until he signs in. Now let’s get 
back to HQ.” 

Carver sat in his operator’s chair 
by the door. Somewhere out there 
in the city, right now, a murder was 
being committed. Somewhere a man, 
or woman, a boy or girl, was being 
brutally done to death. His job was 
to find out who had broken that 
basic commandment — “Thou shalt 
not kill.” 




108 



IF 




Just so long as he remembered 
that, just so long as he put on the 
sensing lobes and waited until the 
murderer struck and then came back 
to the real world and gave the police 
every significant item of information 
he could, just so long as he went 
on doing his job then he would re- 
gard himself as doing a useful piece 
of work in society. If he began to 
doubt himself then he must doubt 
society and all it stood for. 

He couldn’t allow that. Behind 
the Shield there was nothing left for 
him in this world. Apart from Wen- 
dy — and she was a magic world 
apart. A burnt out husk of a man, 
he must cling with all the vicious 
selfishness in him to this one vital 
personality datum; do a good job 
and rest content. 

But it was damned hard. 

II 

A lec Durlston had still not report- 
ed in for duty by the time it 
was Hovervan Number Three’s turn 
for duty again. Charlie Rawlinson 
switched on the radio and checked 
wavelengths with control. Then he 
looked up at the tri-di map of the 
city. It was angled against the junc- 
tion of two walls and roof so that it 
tilted out and over them, presenting 
a detailed schematic. Color coding 
of trafficlanes, airways, pedways 
and autoramps crisscrossing the ave- 
nues and boulevards lent a ghostly 
pseudo-beauty to the city map. 
“Busy night,” said Soames. 
R.I.D., the heart and brain of rid- 
force, was contained in the hover- 
vans as they waited in the yard for 



their calls. Sometimes they waited a 
long time. Other times, like now, the 
calls crackled in with frightening 
speed, demanding the headlong rush 
to death zero. 

The radio blasted. Everyone twist- 
ed around automatically to stare at 
it. Before the words had finished 
spurting from the speaker the vans 
were hissing with compressed air, 
rising, flowing forward with the 
ground effect rolling them along on 
cushions of air. 

“Attention Three. Death Zero cor- 
ner of Fredericks and Montgomery. 
South side. Male. Dropped twenty 
stories, death instantaneous. Major 
damage. Triple alarm.” 

“Major damage,” said Charlie 
Rawlinson. “Hell! You may have 
trouble, Robin.” 

“I’ll cope.” 

The door of the van sprang open. 
It was already moving at ten miles 
an hour and the figure bundling in 
charged head down into the van 
with the violence of his rush. Papers 
cascaded to the floor. Soames look- 
ed around from his seat beside the 
driver, scowling. 

“What’s going on? Oh — it’s you 
Alec.” 

“It’s me,” said Alec Durlston, 
straightening up and pulling his 
jacket down. “Who did you expect? 
If I hadn’t broken the hundred-yard 
sprint record you’d have taken off 
without me.” 

Of course it wasn’t just what 
Durlston said. It was his general 
attitude. What he didn’t say. What 
he meant. Quite clearly, he was say- 
ing: “It’s your fault I had to run 
and jump in, you clods. You 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN 



109 




couldn’t even wait for a gentleman. 
But that’s all one could expect from 
the likes of cretins like you.” 
Naturally, it was anyone’s fault 
he was late but his. 

He looked down on Carver, a 
lean, long look, his overly-handsome 
face sardonic, waiting. 

“Well?” Durlston said acidly. 
“Hullo, Durlston,” said Carver. 
He couldn’t think of anything he 
could say to this man, so he re- 
mained sitting silently there. 

“Aren’t you going to get up, man? 
You’re sitting in my chair.” 

Slowly, Carver rose, letting his 
body sway slightly with the van’s 
progress. He didn’t look at the oth- 
ers in the van. He couldn’t. 

Durlston took a tissue and flick- 
ed the seat, then he sat down with 
his jacket on, looking cool and calm 
and impeccable. Carver mooched off 
up the van and pulled a flap seat out 
of the wall. He felt his body sway- 
ing and surging, as the van sped 
madly along the airways, unsupport- 
ed by the cushioning back and arms 
of a regular chair. 

Durlston was on watch. That was 
die operator’s chair and Durlston 
had the right to sit there. But the 
whole incident was so petty it boiled 
Carver up — or would have if he 
could have been bothered to care. 

F or the first time this night, 
apart ‘ from that fleeting mo- 
ment of boiling-over anger when 
Cy Adams had quizzed him he 
thought of Wendy. Slim, serious, 
big-eyed Wendy, with the straight 
blonde hair helmeting her head, her 
features solemn with all the worry- 



ing perplexities of life facing a four- 
teen-year old without a mother*! 
guiding hand. No — he was slipping. 
Wendy was fifteen now. Time had 
rushed past with the crazy speed of 
a rocket. 

The thought of Wendy and of 
Marv and Belle frightened Carver. 
So Wendy had been brought up 
without the counsel of a mother. 
But she’d had her father and the 
Home and they’d turned out some 
of the finest girls in the world. 
Wendy was all right. Wendy was 
straight. Only Carver’s consuming 
love for her made him worry. Any- 
one so favored, it used to be said, 
would be marked out for the jeal- 
ousy of the gods. What should he 
do, then — disfigure her? Try to 
camouflage her? Try to cocoon her 
away from life. 

That couldn’t be done. Even the 
husk of a man that was Robin Car- 
ver had the wit to recognize that. 

The siren slashing a screaming 
blade of sound through the thick 
city night, the hovervans drove 
fiercely through scattering traffic in 
the blazing energy of their duty to 
reach death zero in under three 
minutes. 

They didn’t always do it, of 
course. They seldom did; but it was 
the target figure demanded by regu- 
lations. In three minutes the human 
brain deprived of blood would be 
damaged beyond repair. 

But then — ridforce weren’t try- 
ing to repair brains. Just get there 
fast, find the body, slip it into the 
ridmach hovervan, slap it on the pal- 
let, attach the sensing lobes — in- 
vestigate.

The drive:- uw' ve van around a 
semi-banked cornei so fast the mag- 
netic repulsors partially blanked and 
the van canted and skidded, air 
sizzling away in a steaming fan 
behind it. He had the triple tur- 
bines opened right out and after- 
burners on. The vans bellowed a 
colossal reverberating roar across 
the city, belching smoke. Any free- 
flying aircraft un-connected to the 
city’s intricate trafficlanes would 
have smashed headlong into any one 
of a dozen obstacles. Free-flying 
craft were strictly for outside the 
city. 

Outside the city. That was an 
old-fashioned way of looking at it, 
as though the city was more impor- 
tant than the country. 

Naturally, there could never be a 
crash, a road accident. They belong- 
ed to those queer far-off times when 
people allowed their teeth to rot in 
their jaws, blew their noses into 
doth and shoved it into their pock- 
ets, smoked tobacco that hadn’t been 
treated against lung cancer, let old 
people die alone and forgotten in 
dusty back rooms. 

A lec Durlston took the pallet as 
the victim, shrouded in a plas- 
tic sheet, lay beside him. Marjie re- 
fused to have him on the second 
pallet. 

“Poor devil,” said Carver, half to 
himself. “Did he fall? Or was he 
helped?” 

“I’ll soon find out.” Durlston lay 
back and waited for Marjie to com- 
plete the connections. 

Just how it was done Carver knew 
be would never understand. What 



mattered to him and the police de- 
partments was that it did happen. 
From the sensing lobes on the dead 
man’s head, from the sensing lobes 
on Durlston’s head, power flowed. 
And the ridmach did the rest. The 
scientists who had developed R.I.D. 
knew how it operated. Carver had 
heard talk of electrical synapse en- 
ergy interchange, of the residual 
memory charges, of the permanent 
imprint of memory on cell structure, 
the complex amino acids and col- 
loids subtly altered and distorted so 
that they would never be the same 
again but always record what had 
been imprinted on them. Only death 
would destroy those changes, would 
set liquid putrefaction to its task of 
tearing down and liquefying all 
traces of what had once been a 
man’s mind. 

No wonder the detectives of rid- 
force screamed their way across the 
city to death zero with all turbo- 
fans alight and afterburners full on, 
breaking near mach unity in the de- 
termined effort to tune in to the 
dead man before death’s clogging 
hand of putrefaction brought a slimy 
chaos to the tuned perfection of a 
human brain. 

When a person died in the city 
the D.L. at ridforce HQ picked up 
the radiation. Machinery hurled that 
information onto the city map in 
the duty hovervan, blasted the crew 
and the operator out into the city, 
homed in on the DZ. Without the 
very necessary function of the Death 
Locator at ridforce HQ the hover- 
vans would seldom and only by 
chance arrive at death zero in time. 

Soames called. When Carver went

through to the admin van he saw 
to his surprise that the crew was 
packing up. 

“You’re going to love this, Rob- 
in,” said Charlie Rawlinson, shutting 
the door. 

“Oh?” 

“Yeah. Another call. DZ is close 
and we’re the nearest van. And we 
happen to be carrying a spare oper- 
ator.” 

On the map the ruby light of DZ 
blinked balefully like Tentoki, the 
demon lantern bearer. The glittering 
star of white light representing r id- 
force hovervan number three spar- 
kled up to that ruby eye. Minutes 
later, Carver was saying: “Oh, no! A 
female! That’s not for me.” 

“It’s like this, Robin,” Soames 
said patiently. “We’re here. You’re 
here. The body’s here. Ergo — you 
go in, female or no female. Check.*’ 

“And that’s what I call a sweet 
reasoned explanation.” 

“HQ would send out another van 
with a female operator; but things 
are hectic tonight. There was a buzz 
Whitcliffe himself was on the 
prowl.” 

“So you see, Robin, I know you 
ops don’t like going in when it’s a 
female. But needs must.” 

Charlie Rawlinson waved an arm 
and the crew snatched the girl into 
the van with a courtesy for not-yet- 
cold clay inherent in their attitude. 

In the female regime the ridmach 
had sometimes to be triflingly re- 
adjusted. Carver lay on the pallet. 
He looked at the girl. Her small 
slender body had been clad in a 
silver sheath of iridescent scales and 
she still wore one nylon. Her hair, 



long and lustrously black beneath 
the harsh lights, lay unbound. Her 
face, oval and well-featured, had 
been pretty with an olive complex- 
ion and magnificent eyes. Her com- 
plexion was different now, of course. 

So far nobody had taken away 
the nylon stocking knotted around 
her neck. 

Cy Adams put his head in the 
door. “Her name was Julie Farish. 
Good hunting, Robin.” 

Marjie pushed the start button and 
coalescing darkness and sunwhorls 
closed on Robin Carver. 

T he velvet cushion thrust cruelly 
against her cheek. 

She couldn’t turn her head to 
look up at Roger, imploringly, ap- 
pealingly, why? Why was Roger 
doing this? Her thoughts dazzled, 
chaotic impression, fragments, the 
constricting feel of something tight 
about her neck, tight — tight! 

She couldn’t scream — her tongue 
burst past her lips — her eyes pain- 
ed with the pressure — she couldn’t 
breathe — couldn’t breathe! 

She tried to move, floundering 
like a fish carelessly cast into the 
bottom of a boat, flashing silver and 
slinky like her new dress. Black and 
red sparks cascaded across her blind- 
ed eyes. The feeling in her throat 
and neck — the feeling? the pain! — 
the pain had gone. She felt sleepy — ■ 
sleepy . 

All men were different — but all 
the same. She’d had to learn to 
handle men. She’d learned. And 
Roger had seemed nice — floating 
on a cottonwool cloud — couldn’t 
talk — silence! calls the headmistress 



112 



IF 




— Roger had been nice; but he’d 
been funny. Headache. 

Oh, God! I’m being murdered! 

Only Robin Carver’s mind exper- 
ienced the death of Julie Farish. He 
cringed. This was never pleasant. 

And she didn't look at this Roger 
once! 

There was nothing left at this end 
of the penetration envelope. Time 
was running out. I'll have to go 
back. 

Latch on to a dying person’s 
thoughts. Tap in to death’s memo- 
ries. The memoirs of final extinction 
to be pored over, studied, learned. 

Robin Carver skipped rapidly 
through the earliest memories, the 
unhappy childhood, the orphanage, 
the first man, the jobs, flipping the 
yellowed pages of memory. 

The story was familiar. He would 
touch down at the first discrete act 
that set in motion this entirely sep- 
arate series of events that led up to 
the murder; if any portion of a per- 
son’s life can be divorced from the 
rest. He’d awake with Julie onto the 
last pages of her life. 

Ill 

T he Sweetness and Light Tea- 
rooms had, a fortnight before, 
been known as the Ever Joyful and 
Serene Coffee Garden. Unfortunate- 
ly a group of Withits had broken in, 
parking their deliberately noisy ho- 
verscooters anywhere about the 
chaste green lawns and sand and 
rock gardens. And they had pro- 
ceeded with gusto and verve to take 
the place apart. 

Marcel had been livid. He was a 



slender man with a moist mouth and 
hands that wandered. He had redone 
the place and given it a new name 
and soon the old clientele drifted 
back. The same trade went on. 

“Hello, Julie darling!” Marcel 
smiled, oilily. “So sweet.” 

“So help me, Marcel, I don’t 
want another night like last. If you 
do I’ll — I’ll — ” 

“Yes. ducks? What will you do?” 
the words were steel encased in an 
oil slick. 

Julie made a face. “Just think of 
me, sometimes!” 

“But I do, darling, I do!” 

“Tell me about the party.” Julie 
changed the subject uncomfortably. 
She knew the strengths of the syn- 
dicates in the city, strengths a young 
girl, alone, could never match. 

“This is important, Julie. A group 
of new customers. Harry will take 
you and the other girls. Remember! 
I want you to be particularly good 
tonight.” 

Harry turned out to be a hunk of 
a man with gorilla features and hair 
spining from the backs of his hands. 
Watching everything from his perch 
there in Julie’s mind, Carver missed 
nothing. Harry was the girl’s pro- 
tection. 

You're going to fall down on 
your job tonight , Harry. 

Their hovercar sloughed along the 
autolanes and then with a settling 
sigh of expiring air came to rest. 
The door slid open. 

Julie’s quick eyes picked up the 
signs of luxury in this pent-house 
apartment, the refinement and de- 
cadence, the over-ripe bloom on the 
fruit of pleasure. Carver picked up 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN

places, faces, words, gestures, stor- 
ing them away against the time he 
would sit in hovervan number three 
and make his report. 

Before leaving the hovercar Julie 
checked to see that her nylons were 
straight in a tiny almost childish 
movement, a birdlike twist of her 
head. 

A flunkey left them in a waiting 
room with: “Wait here. Mr. Pritch- 
ard will be along shortly.” 

Pritchard turned out to be quiet 
and unassuming with the air of a 
confidential valet. Perhaps only 
Carver of the five watching him ob- 
served the deeper power-complex of 
the man. He stood for a moment 
studying them, his head on one side, 
considering. Boldly his eyes strayed 
over the girl’s faces and figures, 
coming to a decision. 

“You,” he said, beckoning to 
Julie. “Put your shoes on and come 
with me.” 

“Now wait a minute — ” began 
Harry. 

Pritchard said nastily: “I don’t 
think your master would care for 
you to be present as your friend 
earns her living. Anyway, your job 
is to protect these — ah — ladies out- 
side. Not inside.” He jerked a per- 
fectly polite yet unmistakably im- 
perative hand at Julie. “Come on.” 

So Julie is a Gaiety Girl. Poor 
lost soul. They ought to have sent 
a female op on this one . 

In the corridor outside Pritchard 
put. his arm around Julie’s waist and 
pressed familiarly. Indecision hit 
Julie, then she let the hand lie un- 
removed. It couldn’t make any dif- 
ference now. Up ahead a door 



showed where the hall turned at 
rightangles beneath shaded fluores- 
cents. 

Pritchard lengthened his stride 
and the arm around Julie’s waist 
pressed her on more rapidly. Carver 
realized that arm had not been ama- 
tory but organizational. A burst of 
laughter spilled from the door. That 
door showed a plain black patina 
with a single simple silver, es- 
cutcheon, a lion rampant grasping a 
shattered silver shield, modestly dis- 
played on each leaf. Golden bolt 
heads and hinge flaps lent a splendid 
air of barbaric gorgeousness to the 
door. Pritchard was clearly trying to 
hustle Julie past it before it opened 
fully. 

“Hurry, girl!” he said and the 
words snapped sharp and shrewish. 

The image of an ogre headmis- 
tress rose up. And Julie deliberately 
allowed one long nyloned leg to 
slide out between Pritchard’s black 
trousers, to trip him, to send him 
sprawling in undignified ungainliness 
onto the carpeted floor. 

“Oh, dear, Mr. Pritchard!” said 
Julie, all contriteness. “I’m so sorry!” 

B ut the door had opened and two 
men reeled out, laughing and 
boisterous, caterwauling. Between 
them, a hand around each waist, a 
girl danced, the arms of the men 
heavy and lascivious on her shoul- 
ders. Julie took one swift glance at 
the men, past them into the room 
beyond the black lion-guarded door. 

A packed cacaphony of sound, a 
welter of lights, a dizzying titilla- 
tion of scents and the roaring im- 
pression of an infernal calliope in 



114 



IF 




full blast chorused from that jam- 
packed room. Here was the party. 
Julie’s face reflected animation and 
she lingered as Pritchard cursed 
and hauled himself up. 

A man stood just inside the door, 
smiling a small secret smile as the 
two boisterous near-drunks and the 
girl who was only a blur in the cor- 
ner of Julie’s eye staggered out. The 
man wore the usual inoffensive gray 
suit and black shoes, the string tie 
and the ivory shirt that had become 
a uniform in the upper circles of the 
civil service. Julie glanced with the 
lively interest of a gaiety girl at his 
face — and Carver reacted as though 
stung by a thousand volts of high 
tension. 

Chris Mellor! 

Even a non-eidetic could remem- 
ber the tough sparkling spirit of 
Chris Mellor from the old days! The 
days when Carver had been just such 
a one as Mellor appeared still to be. 
Incredible! He’d thought Mellor 
dead long since . 

Then Pritchard grabbed Julie’s 
arm in a grip that brought a little 
squeal of protest to her lips, drag- 
ged her all angrily sideways from 
that black door and the enticing 
mysteries it concealed. 

Pulled like that, twisted around, 
Julie could not help but look di- 
rectly at the girl between the two 
half-drunken men. 

Her reactions meant nothing to 
Carver. 

He forgot he was a ridforce op- 
erator. 

He forgot that he, himself, was 
not standing in that lushly carpeted 
corridor with the sinful sounds of 



an orgy thundering away in the 
background. 

He wanted to start forward, to 
smash a fist into each of those hid- 
eous brutish men’s faces. He wanted 
to take the girl with the smooth hel- 
met of blonde hair into his arms, to 
take her away, to protect her from 
whatever horror was happening to 
her here. 

He couldn’t do anything but look 
on. 

Wendy! 

Wendy — his Wendy — his own 
daughter — here! 

IV 

A s soon as she had begun work 
on Whitcliffe’s project at the 
Forensic Science Laboratories Carol 
Bursham had decided that Whitcliffe 
was a man with so obsessive a com- 
pulsion that the tiniest outside in- 
trusion would have no chance of 
deflecting him from his life’s am- 
bition. 

What that ambition was, Carol 
didn’t know. But it existed and drove 
on, in turn whipping all of ridforce 
with it. That could not be denied. 
This current project was only a part 
of that over-riding ambition. That 
he would eventually attain the goal 
of his ambitions she was also con- 
vinced. Whitcliffe was that sort of 
man. 

She and Ralph Tzombe, her co- 
worker on the new project, had been 
summoned by Whitcliffe to his villa 
overlooking the cliffs and the sea. 
She lay now on a formfit, comfort- 
able after the morning swim, lazily 
watching the sky. 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN 



115 




“Look — up there!” Carol lifted 
herself on one elbow and pointed 
out to the zenith. Soundlessly a dot 
swam into view high above the Pa- 
cific, soaring at the hundred thou- 
sand feet levels and slowly — so 
slowly at Mach three point five — 
lowering towards them and the shin- 
ing city beyond. 

Few people would call Carol 
Burnham pretty. Poised, superbly 
built, yes. Her eyes, emp’.asized in 
the current fashion trend, were per- 
haps her most powerful weapon in 
her sex armoury. A man, if she 
chose, could lose himself in those 
eyes. 

Tzombe levered himself up. “If 
you look carefully — ” 

“I know. Watch.” Carol stared 
up in near reverent expectancy with 
the still and absorbed concentration 
of a little child. 

Like the fragmentary fluid inter- 
play of colors when a bubble bursts, 
like the palest flickering chrome of 
a zip-fastener in the sky, ineffably 
comforting, a single shining sliver 
slashed down the sky and vanished. 

“It makes you feel good to see 
that!” breathed Carol. 

The plane passed overhead and 
dropped still further as she turned 
slowly onto her preliminary circuit. 

Carol voiced a strange remote 
question. “I wonder where that 
plane’s flown in from?” 

“From?” said Tzombe, startled. 
“No idea. Isn’t there a schedule 
here? I know Whitcliffe has one. I 
believe he’s actually flown some- 
where outside the Shield — all praise 
and thanks. I think Japan is in that 
direction — westwards. I’m almost 



su:e it's Japan, but it may be Afri- 
ca. I don’t really know for sure." 

“Japan,” said Carol, and shivered. 
“The thought of flying out — you 
know, flying outside — makes me 
feel naked.” 

“To the Shield all glory and gra- 
titude,” Tzombe said automatically. 
“I bet those people up there are un- 
scrambling their nerves right now.” 

“I hear they take more tranquil- 
izers than fuel.” 

“Could be.” Tzombe stood up. 
“Here comes Whitcliffe.” 

To anyone who did not know 
him, Whitcliffe looked an ordinary 
man. 

“Good morning, Whitcliffe,” they 
said in unison. 

“I wanted to tell you the work 
is not going fast enough. I want 
positive results inside a fortnight.” 

The words struck like a scimitar. 
“But,” Carol stammered. “We’ve 
been doing so well! And we know 
we cannot produce results inside a 
year.” 

“A fortnight, Doctor Burnham.” 

“We could do it if we assumed 
success was definite.” Tzombe 
prowled restlessly on the bouganvillea 
bowered balcony hung over the 
moving sea. “If we said we were 
right and proceeded on that line — ” 

“Yes,” said Whitcliffe. 

Cautiously, feeling her way, Car- 
ol said: “We therefore state this: 
The ridmach works. It is a proven 
tool but it lacks one quality. It must 
be applied very shortly after death 
if the operator is to achieve any 
coherent picture of the victim’s 
movements.” 

Ralph Tzombe carried on aa 



116 



IF 




though quoting: “To counter the 
difficulty of the breakdown of the 
mind, ridforce operators are hur- 
ried to death zero as fast as after- 
burning turbofans can take them. 
The Death Locator at HQ can pin 
point death zero for us. Our job is 
to get the operator and the equip- 
ment there with as little delay as 
possible.” 

“But,” said Whitcliffe lazily, 
“your job now is to reverse the 
order of events. You are trying to 
compensate for the lack of an oper- 
ator and a ridmach at death zero. 
You are going to provide a piece 
of apparatus that will scan the dead 
brain and record onto magnetic 
tape. And the equipment will be 
packaged into a handy size. You are 
going to do it — because it can be 
done.” 

After a moment, Tzombe said: 
“Well do it, Whitcliffe.” 

Whitcliffe was addressed as ‘sir’ 
or ‘Whitcliffe’ — nothing else. 

“You have the Forensic Science 
Laboratories at your disposal, and 
they are as well equipped as any 
laboratory in the Americas.” 

C arol nodded; but her mind pick- 
ed up one word spoken by 
Whitcliffe; one word that she sup- 
posed only he among a very few 
others ever used, a word that at once 
was so obsolete and so much a soul- 
mate of everyone that it had became 
a shadow- word, never used — always 
present. Americas. Everyone else 
called the country “this continent” 
or “the land”, — or “the world”. 
Americas. 

But only they had the Shield 
THE DOOMSDAY MEN 



(great and glorious Shield to whom 
be everlasting thanks and gratitude!) 
and everything outside was less than 
nothing. There was an Outside out- 
side the Shield (by whom we are 
sustained) but it had no meaning. 

Whitcliffe flicked a yellow ab- 
stract. “Last night there were fifty 
murders in the city. Last year thirty. 
The trend is up. We must have that 
recording ridmach in use within a 
week from your development finals.” 
Tzombe harrumphed. “We can 
claim a near hundred per cent suc- 
cess in arrests when the operator 
actually sees the murderer. And even 
when he doesn’t, the clues he can 
pick up from the victim’s mind give 
the police enough to arrest the real 
murderer in something like ninety- 
eight per cent of the cases.” 
“Well?” 

“Only that this seems to have no 
effect on the murder rate. Suppose 
the public were told that the rki- 
force existed — ” 

“No!” said Carol automatically. 
“Let him continue, Doctor Burn- 
ham.” Whitcliffe’s soft voice would 
have frozen lesser men; but Tzombe 
carried on valiantly. 

“We keep ridforce a secret be- 
cause we needed time to prove its 
efficacy. There were enough pro- 
phets of failure when we began. 
But now — if a man knew he would 
be stared at and identified by the 
police through the eyes of his vic- 
tim, surely he would hesitate, he 
wouldn’t murder.” 

“They thought once if a criminal 
knew his fingerprints could identify 
him there’d be no more crime. 
What happened?” 

nr 




“Gloves,” answered Tzombe. 

“And then?”' 

“Recognition patterns of glove 
texture — followed by destruction of 
gloves, followed by ash reclamation 
and analysis, followed by total and 
secret destruction, followed by 
sweat and breath analysis, shape and 
measurement analysis — and all the 
rest.” 

“But?” 

“But fingerprints and the follow- 
ing ramifications of the techniques 
of detection can be nullified.” 

“So?” 

“But,” plunged on Tzombe des- 
perately. “We would have our pre- 
meditated murder with the murderer 
wearing a mask and disguise. But in 
all the others — the sudden flash of 
anger blowing off the top of your 
head, and you come to with the 
bloody knife and the body — in 
those we’d still be able to see who 
had murdered.” 

“Precisely. But in those cases even 
the old time detectives could usual- 
ly detect the murderer. In the one 
case of premeditated murder is the 
value of R.I.D. so overwhelming we 
dare not make it public knowledge.” 

“I think,” Carol said carefully, 
“we might deter a few would-be 
murderers. But the vast majority 
who intended to kill would dream 
up means of evading R.I.D.” 

T zombe slumped dejectedly into 
his formfit. “You’re right, of 
course. But the idea sounds so at- 
tractive . What annoys me is 
why people want to murder! We’ve 
never had it so good as now. Ev- 
erything the heart can desire is right 



here in the continent. We just don’t 
have troubles any more.” 

“You’re too well integrated a per- 
sonality to understand the desires 
that ferment in your fellow-citizens. 
The Shield, artificial manufacture of 
food and fuels, giveaway prices for 
clothes you wear once and toss 
away, homes and transport and lux- 
uries almost for the taking — all 
these genuinely wonderful things 
can mean nothing if the girl you 
want to go to bed with laughs at 
you and lets Joe Soap around the 
corner put his arm round her 
waist. The red gets into your eyes, 
then, Doctor Tzombe. And you just 
described what can happen.” 

“I know, I know,” protested 
Tzombe, “but I mean these other 
murders. These senseless deaths of 
respectable men and women on the 
streets, anywhere, everywhere. They 
make nonsense of our way of life.” 
“These stupid teenage gangs, the 
Withits, the Slashers.” 

“But we discover who is commit- 
ting the murder from our ridforce 
operators up at the sharp end of rid- 
force. And we secure convictions, 
and still it goes on.” 

“Surely, Ralph, you’re not sug- 
gesting we’re making mistakes!” 
Carol felt shock. 

Whitcliffe interjected softly, “It 
would be a shattering blow to us to 
discover we were condemning inno- 
cent people.” 

This had been a running sore 
since the inception of ridforce. “We 
have to believe in our operators,” 
Carol said passionately. “If they 
fail, if they are corrupt, if they are 
careless — why — why — ”

THE DOOMSDAY MEN 




“We might as well pack up all 
the fantastically expensive equip- 
ment of ridforce and go home,” 
Whitcliffe finished the thought for 
them all. 

Going down to their hovercar, 
Tzombe said with a sly friendly 
smile: “This will get you off the 
hook with Alec Durlston, Carol.” 

“I can’t stand the man’s man- 
ner,” Carol said, “but — ” 

She paused. Something about 
Durlston’s lean physical strength 
tugged at the womanliness in her. 
She knew what he wanted, and she 
both yearned for and shrank from 
It “I’m always sad to leave Whit- 
diffe’s villa,” she said firmly. 
•There’s a clean air here that all the 
city’s fumigants can never repro- 
duce.” 

Gently, Whitcliffe reminded them 
as the hovercar’s door slid shut: “In 
a fortnight. I shall keep in close 
touch.” 

Just before the hovercar’s engines 
turned over and drowned such tiny 
cries a gull screeched, clear and 
lone, from across the bay.

“Where were you born?” 

“The Old Oast, Brenchley, Kent.” 
“When?” • 

“T wenty-sixth August, eighty- 
nine.” 

“When was the last time you felt 
like going to bed with a man?” 
“Sorry, Cy. Never did. I’m heter- 
osexual, thank God. Fm a male, I 
feel like a male, I act like a male. 



Poor Julie Farish couldn’t alter 
that.” 

/ don't think about Wendy yet. 
Not yet. Not until I get out of this 
van and find a place to worry and 
worry. Steady, boy! Steady ! 

“You’re all right, Robin. But 
there’s something odd in there some- 
place. I’d hazard the guess you’d 
been through a traumatic experi- 
ence.” 

“Not me, Cy! I just don’t like 
being in the mind of a beautiful 
young girl who’s just had a nylon 
stocking knotted about her neck. Is 
that strange?” 

“Not strange. Quite natural for 
an ordinary man. But you’re not an 
ordinary man, Robin. You’re a rid- 
force operator and, ergo, that means 
you are abnormal — in the nicest 
way, of course.” 

“Of course.” 

“All I’m supposed to do is make 
sure you blokes know you are your- 
selves. Carry on. Soames is waiting.” 

“Did you get him, Robin?” asked 
Soames when Carver pushed through 
into the admin van. 

“No.” 

“No?” Soames exploded. “Well, 
for gosh-sakes! A girl can’t have a 
stocking knotted like that without 
seeing something, surely?” 

“No, Bob. She called the man 
Roger, after she was taken in — 
after she saw — after — ” 

They were staring at him. “Well, 
Robin? Go on!” 

Carver swallowed. “She thought a 
man called Roger murdered her; but 
it wasn’t him. I’ve got him down. 
But even though I didn’t see the 
murderer at all I could tell he wasn’t 



120 



IF 




Roger. You know; sound of foot- 
falls, breath rate, atmospheric things 
we’re all trained to pick up. She 
didn’t look at him — and then the 
stocking was around her neck.” 
“We’ll start with this guy Roger,” 
Soames grunted. “He’ll do as a 
lead. Then we’ll have everyone else 
you saw. Got it, Robin? Everyone.” 
Carver made out his report. All 
of it — except for Chris Mellor. He 
couldn’t tell about Chris, anyway, 
for old time’s sake. One agent 
doesn’t tell on another, even casual- 
ly, even in line of duty, like this. 
Not about Wendy. Not Wendy . 
But of course, he was no longer 
an agent of the Americas, Carver 
reminded himself. They’d thrown 
him out as unstable. No longer fit 
to be an agent. Damned unfair at 
the time; it still rankled. But Chris 
might still be working for the Am- 
ericas and if he was, a broken-down 
ex-agent like Robin Carver wouldn’t 
mention his existence to anyone out- 
side Morgan and the Bureau. 

His fake past had alwavs held up, 
even under the stringent inquiries of 
ridforce. The bureau hadn’t let him 
down there. They knew better than 
anyone else that a secret service 
agent has to live after he’s fired. 

44 r- p'here’s something screwy here, 
A Robin.” Soames stared lump- 
ily at the report sheet and the draw- 
ings of people Carver had seen 
through the eyes of a dead girl. 
“What’s the big mystery?” 

Carver had to get away to think 
this thing through. “No mystery, 
Bob. Apart from not knowing who 
killed Julie Farish.” 



“This leaves me no alternative but 
to assume you fell down on the job. 
You didn’t pry hard enough.” 
“Now just a minute, Bob!” 

“I know how I must sound to 
you. But I’m the detective in charge 
of this van and we’ve never before 
had to put in the kind of report I’m 
being forced to hand in now.” 

Alec Durlston’s soft drawl floated 
infuriatingly across. “Don’t forget, 
Bob, Carver was tired. He’d just 
been on a penetration — and he was 
in a female mind. He should never 
have been allowed to penetrate; it’s 
no wonder he fell flat on his face.” 
“Now listen here, Durlston!” 
“Simmer down, Robin!” Soames 
slammed a thick hand onto his desk. 
“All right, Alec. We all know how 
good an op you are. Let’s get back.” 
Carver slumped. He shut his eyes, 
squatting on the uncomfortable flap- 
down seat, and tried not to think of 
Wendy. 

But of course he couldn’t. 

He could at least drag his mind 
away from that impossible moment 
he had seen her lasciviously en- 
meshed between two half-drunken 
louts and go back to the golden 
days of her childhood — days so far 
away in fact and yet so heart-break- 
ingly near in chronological time. 

She’d been a wonderful child, a 
sanity-giving reason for living, an 
idol he could dedicate his every- 
thing to and negate anything he 
might desire that conflicted with 
hers. But ''she’d grown up true and 
straight, a laughing sprite in the 
sunshine. And now this . 

Back at HQ Soames departed 
carrying the reports. Charlie Raw-

linson said cheerfully: “You’re for 
the hot seat now, Robin.” 

When Soames returned he merely 
said briefly: “You take a day’s leave, 
Robin, starting now. Hammant isn’t 
satisfied. And damn it all, Robin, 
neither am I.” 

Hammant was Chief of this rid- 
force HQ. Carver stood up, feeling 
the weight of tiredness falling on 
him. ‘Til take that leave, Bob. But 
there was no indication whatsoever 
of who killed Julie Farish.” 

I n the old days there would prob- 
ably have been a strong religious 
tone to the Home. Idly flicking 
through a tri-di projector on its wal- 
nut table in the waiting room, Car- 
ver felt a perennial relief that the 
Shield had never quite brought into 
life all the strange religious cults 
such a phenomenon might have 
done. 

White-bearded and robed priests 
chanting strange rituals might so 
easily have come to personify the 
Shield. The life of the continent 
could have become warped, twisted 
away from its true course, made 
into a mockery of the free life of 
absolute liberty and freedom from 
fear. Ritualistic mumbo-jumbo could 
so easily have symbolized the Shield 
in the inner lives of everyone. Now 
it was merely customary to say a 
short phrase of thankfulness that the 
Shield existed. 

CaFver, for one, thanked God it 
should be so. 

He had come to the Home with 
one question to ask and a biting 
fear of the answer. 

Wendy walked in in response to 



the principal’s call on the inter- 
Horne radio network. Wendy looked 
like strawberries and cream, like an 
unsullied box of chocolates, like the 
snows of the High Sierras, like a 
surfer bringing, a board in on sin- 
gles, like a magnum of champagne 
fizzing into your glass, like the high 
altar at Canterbury, like a flushed 
and happiness-drugged child lying 
abed with the sheets snugged to her 
chin. 

Wendy. 

They stared at each other. “Hi, 
Dad. I’m top-level busy. They’re 
teaching us loads of guff about Out- 
side right now — boring as a high 
r.p.m. drill. Hey, what’s up?” 

He hated himself; but training 
could not be denied even now, even 
asking his own daughter. “Pal of 
mine said he thought he’d spotted 
you in the city yesterday, Wendy.” 

She squealed with delight. “What 
a frabjous thought! The city! My, 
oh, my! You know what the Home 
rules are, Dad. Not a chance. But 
wouldn’t I have loved to be there, 
though! Holidays are coming up — 
I’ve made a few tentative arrange- 
ments — ” 

His eidetic memory considered 
the girl with smooth blonde helmet 
of hair, laughing and flushed, ca- 
rousing and abandoned, bursting 
through that ebon door with her 
Minoan dress flounced out around 
her like a collapsing parachute. 
That was Wendy. 

That was Wendy? No. Never. 

H e’d known it couldn’t be — but 
the likeness was so complete 
even he had been deceived. He had 



122 



IP 




believed for a nightmarish millen- 
ium that that poor gaiety girl had 
been his beloved daughter Wendy. 
What sort of a heel was he? 

He had to hold onto his control 
with a bit of iron, champing, want- 
ing to clasp her into his arms and 
hug her as he had done in the old 
days when she’d stood forlornly be- 
fore him, tears dropping round and 
full over her latest calamity. 

Now, of course, she was a young 
lady. 

“You just wait 'til I’m in the city 
this year! Last year I was so young! 
I've grown up since then!” 

“You have, Wendy. But you’ve 
all the time in the world. Don’t run 
too fast. Be content, for a little time 
at least, to walk along beside your 
poor old dad.” 

Her eyes caught a vagrant beam 
of light so that for an instant they 
sparkled dangerously. She burst out: 
“There you go again! Why do you 
do it? Why?” she stopped. 

Carver felt a physical pain knife 
through his guts. Was this the be- 
ginning of the parting he dreaded? 
“What’s that, Wendy?” 

“Oh . just me being woman- 
ish and irritable and irrational. 
You’re my old dad, and that’s all 
that matters.” She looked down at 
her white gym shoes. “Judo next, 
Dad. Of course, I’m quids in having 
you for a father — I know most of 
the holds and throws already. I’m 
boasting, but I’m pretty good. No 
one to touch me on the campus.” 
“There used to be colored belts 
to denote how good you were. I’d 
say yours would be sky-blue pink.” 
“Ha, ha.” 



“Sarcasm, my beautiful brat, will 
get you nowhere.” He dug into his 
pocket, jingled soldars. “Paper mon- 
ey, if you want it. I know nothing 
costs much these days; but you’re 
always in need of some bauble or 
prettifier — ” 

She withdrew her hand. “No, real- 
ly, I don’t — ” 

“Well, you are a rum one. That’s 
the first time I’ve known you ac- 
tually refuse good hard cash! Con- 
science bothering you?” 

She put one hand on his shoul- 
der, twisted him and, before he had 
guessed what she was about, had 
neatly floored him. 

He sat up and blew his cheeks out 
but didn’t get up right away. That 
had been very professional indeed. 
It made him feel good. 

‘That, father mine,” she announc- 
ed dispassionately, “is for that. Any 
more inquisitorial dicta and through 
the window you go!” 

And, by God, he believed she 
could do it, too. 

He rose slowly and, looking up, 
surprised Wendy staring at him with 
a tense critical look, as though she 
was judging the performance of a 
show horse. 

He felt a little bewildered. Then 
she smiled and the sun came out and 
he wondered why he doubted her at 
all. 

She’d been here, at the Home. 
The poor raddled gaiety girl he’d 
seen had been just that. Already he 
was getting to work to correct his 
eidetic memory. 

“Must fly, Dad. Lovely to see 
you. But next time let me know 
first, huh?” 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN 



123 




“Sure, Wendy.” He kissed her. 
“Cheers. And — look after your- 
self.” 

A s he left he was considering 
that, thankful though he had 
been to have mistaken that girl for 
Wendy, he had been mistaken about 
Chris Mellor. So far he had man- 
aged to push aside the unwelcome 
thought that for a man to mistake a 
stranger for hk own daughter was 
hardly a recommendation for a rid- 
mach operator. 

Funny thing — it had been 
through Chris that the Home had 
Heen recommended to him. 

All the way back he gleed in the 
: ought that now all he had to do 
.s so to arrange things that he 
■~';ild report in on that ebon door 
r.nd the two thugs and the girl who 
v. as not Wendy. He felt really good. 
Only when he casually tried to an- 
alyze why he felt so good was the 
surprising thought brought home to 
him. 

He was actually doing something! 
But wasn’t he a burned out husk 
of a man? An ex-agent of the 
Americas with a blasted career? A 
man with no hope and no future? 
A man whose wife had run off with 
a satellite engineer? A man whose 
passionately obsessive possession of 
a single daughter had kept him sane? 
Surely he was. 

But he was actually doing some- 
thing. He had a purpose now. He 
had been able to lie down on the 
ridmach pallet, don the sensing lobes 
and venture — bravely! — into the 
mind of a dead person. 

That had been pseudo-life, if you 



like. But now he felt the stirring of 
a purpose outside all of that. Chris 
Mellor was still around and Carver 
wanted to know why. 

He felt wonderful. 

The feeling persisted as he let 
himself into his apartment in the 
city. Then he halted, staring foolish- 

iy- 

“Hello, Soames. I didn’t expect to 
see you in my apartment. How’d 
you get in?” 

“Don’t worry about that now, 
Robin.” Soames jerked a hand at 
the trim, dapper man with the lan- 
guid expression of a pro fencer and 
the face of an executioner. “This is 
Mister Lines. We’ve had a direc- 
tive about you from Higher Up.” 

“Higher Up?” 

“The police fished two men out 
of the sea a short time ago. The 
D. L. picked up their deaths but 
by the time a hovervan arrived at 
the D. Z. both men had been in the 
sea long enough. Their heads and 
faces had been deliberately maltreat- 
ed. But our lab techs picked up 
enough to make them think they 
were these two.” 

Soames held out two pieces of 
white card. Carver recognized his 
own work. The colored likeness of 
Pritchard, the oily arrangements 
man for the gaiety girls, and of 
Roger, the pleasure-seeking wet- 
mouthed roue, stared back at him. 

“Both killed? And no penetra- 
tion?” 

“None was possible. Their brains 
had been mashed to a pulp.” 

“That’s bad!” 

When Lines spoke Carver did not 
like the sound of the man’s voice. 



124 



IF 




He forced himself to look up and 
brace himself to meet that meaning- 
ful voice with a calm composure. 

“The directive from Higher Up, 
Mr. Carver,” Lines said, “is that 
the time has passed for games. You 
know more about the Farish case 
than you have told us. We want to 
know all you saw — everything!” 

VI 

F rom ridforce headquarters a 
black-painted hovercar took 
them from the tenth floor. All the 
time Carver kept telling himself that 
they couldn’t prove anything. Only 
he had been into the mind of Julie 
Farish. But this creature Lines, a 
ridforce security man, acted chilling- 
ly as though he knew Carver had 
kept something back. 

No longer was the problem how 
to insinuate the likenesses of the 
men he had failed to report into his 
records. Now the problem was how 
to stay out of the trouble he ap- 
peared to have tumbled in up to 
his neck. 

The hovercar squished through the 
city, executed a series of compli- 
cated landing maneuvers and sighed 
gently onto a landing platform. Out 
on the platform they bustled through 
a door and — 

“Hey!” said Carver. 

“That’s right.” Soames walked on 
ahead, bunched and determined. 

He remembered the way Julie 
had checked her nylons here, that 
childlike pathetic twist of her head. 

“Let’s get on with it.” Lines kept 
one hand in his pocket. This was 
the test. This was the re-run. The 



police had turned up the place 
where Julie had been choked into 
unconsciousness before being taken 
away to be killed. Now they were 
watching him, scrutinizing him, 
checking on him. They couldn’t tap 
his thoughts — not yet, not until he 
was dead. 

Cheerful thought, that. 

Lines led out in just the way 
Pritchard had done. 

Up ahead the corridor turned at 
right angles beneath the fluorescents. 
Carver tensed. He knew the door 
that should be there — that was in 
fact there as they walked on and its 
ebon surface, bolted and barred with 
gold and flaunting that silver lion 
and shield escutcheon, came into 
view. 

He forced himself to remain calm. 
He must not reveal that he was 
filled with a turmoil of indecision. 

They clearly knew a lot. They 
must guess he had not told them 
everything. The frightening thing 
was the importance they attached 
to that. Lines was a high-class se- 
curity man and, if Carver’s eye for 
details had not faded since his AA 
days, he was also a licensed execu- 
tioner. 

But they seemed to know too 
much! 

That had been the fact puzzling 
him. There was a whole lot more 
intrigue behind this than the mere 
balking of information. 

He still hadn’t decided what to 
do. 

He said: “Pritchard fell over 

here. Julie said she was sorry. I 
don’t think she was, really.” 

“You didn’t mention this door in 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN 



125 




your report.” Lines spoke softly. 

“That’s right.” He’d made up his 
mind. “I think Julie must have 
twisted away. The next thing she 
knew Pritchard was digging his 
nails into her arm and dragging her 
away like a sack of meal.” 

“She didn’t look into the room, 
then?” 

“What room? Oh — you mean 
the room beyond that door. How 
could she? I mean, she was being 
hauled off by Pritchard. She didn’t 
see the door.” 

“Your report indicated she left 
the waiting room, went through to 
the bedroom . 

“That’s right.” 

“You didn’t mention this bit 
about Pritchard falling over.” 

“No.” He wasn’t going to help 
them; or put a single word into his 
mouth that wasn’t necessary. 

“She didn’t hear anything?” 

“Pritchard was cursing. He seem- 
ed most annoyed.” 

This was crazy! Here he was ac- 
tually acting as though he must con- 
firm what Pritchard had told them 
— yet Pritchard was dead before 
they’d got a sensing lobe to him! 
They couldn’t know what Pritchard 
had to tell. 

Could they? 

One thing was sure. Now he 
couldn’t tell them about those two 
men waltzing out with the pseudo- 
Wendy. That gaVe him a twinge of 
conscience. They could go whistle 
before he’d mention Chris Mellor. 
But the others, now . 

They could be the lead to the 
murder — and he was concealing 
their existence. 



C arver decided he was not acting 
naturally enough. He’d better 
react with the cross, rather put-out 
attitude of a guy not really compre- 
hending what this was all about, but 
resentful of the implications. 

He said: “I don’t get all this. Bob 
said the report wasn’t a good one; 
but I couldn’t help that. Julie just 
didn’t see the man who strangled 
her. What’s all the mystery?” 

“You didn’t hear anything else?” 
“A party seemed to be going on 
somewhere, but it didn’t register 
with anyone.” 

“Ah.” 

So that was his explanation for 
the gust of noise when the door 
opened. So let them pick the bones 
out of that. 

“You fully understand. Carver, 
that when we do not get a sighting 
report from an operator we have 
to make sure of the facts?” 

Carver put on his best angry-hurt 
look. 

“Oh! I get it! Of all the low-down 
underhand rotten things to think! 
You think I was bribed!” He started 
to swing his arms about. “Well, I’m 
a ridforce operator! I don’t take 
graft. I didn’t spot the murderer 
and I’m sorry for that — but it’s not 
my fault!” He subsided. 

He’d put on a nice performance. 
“Say now, Robin — ” began 

Soames, worried. 

“We understand your position, 
Carver.” Lines took his hand out 
of his pocket; some of the tension 
eased out of the atmosphere. The 
ridforce security man came to a de- 
cision. “We know you don’t take 
graft, Carver. But . 



126 



IF 




Ridforce had been punctiliously 
strict about employing only top 
quality people. A breath of suspi- 
cion could blast a man’s chances of 
ever being asked. No one volunteer- 
ed — because no one of the public 
knew ridforce existed. 

But the possibility of graft had 
not been overlooked. At first it had 
appeared impossible. How, you 
might ask, could a man sitting 
watching from the mind of a dead 
person taking graft to conceal the 
murderer? Ah — but suppose Car- 
ver had recognized the man who 
had murdered Julie. Suppose, for 
instance, it had been Roger. What 
then? 

Easy. Easy cash. 

He would have said nothing. Julie 
looked away, the room was dark, 
someone else had done it. Not 
Roger. 

As he had said. 

Then, casually, comfortably, wear- 
ing the smooth unbearable smile of 
the blackmailer, he would have gone 
to Roger and made a deal. And 
Roger would have paid up. Oh, yes, 
he would. He wouldn’t know that 
the very fact of Carver’s eidetic 
memory precluded him from ever 
saying he had forgotten a fact, that 
a face had, slipped his memory, that 
now he would put the finger on 
Roger. 

Corruption as a time-binding phe- 
nomenon was eminently practicable 
with ridforce. Any slight breath of 
it had to be investigated. Strangely, 
this quizzing brought one relief; he 
was not now committed to inserting 
the faces of those two thugs and 
the pseudo-Wendy into the files. 



Still . there had been an al- 
most panic-stricken reaction to this 
Farish case history. He’d have to 
think about it. It might be reward- 
ing. 

I n the Forensic Science Labora- 
tories Carol Burnham undipped 
the sensing lobes from Lines’s tem- 
ples and pressed the _ green finish 
button. Ralph Tzombe smiled warm- 
ly at her. 

“We’ve done it, Carol. And well 
within Whitcliffe’s time schedule. I 
don’t think he’s as pleased as you 
are!” 

“You’re right, Ralph.” Carol 
watched critically as Lines opened 
his eyes. She hadn’t let Whitcliffe 
down. She picked up the cigarette- 
pack-sized mech, seeing the insides 
clearly with her own inner eye. 

“It’s all here, Ralph. Just pull out 
these sensing lobes, attach them to 
the decedent and switch on. And all 
the ridmach will want is absorbed 
and magnetically recorded on micro- 
tape. Then you just slip the lobes on 
and run the tape and you become 
an operator and penetrate on a rid- 
force assignment. And you can do 
it hours, days, years after the vic- 
tim meets death zero!” 

Lines said: “Wha — No! Keep 

him off!” 

At once Carol cursed herself for 
a conceited fool. “Listen, Lines! 
Your name is Josiah Lines! Remem- 
ber! Where were you born?” 

“Uh,” gargled Lines. “He came 
at me with a knife . .” 

“Where were you born?” 
“Galveston, Texas. But the knife 
— it went right in . .** 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN 



127 




“Hold up, Lines! When were you 
born?” 

“Don’t you understand?” Lines 
raked up, caught her wrist in a con- 
stricting grip. “That sour-faced 
swine murdered me! So where am I? 
What happened!” 

“You’re in the Forensic Science 
Labs, Lines, and well you know 
it! You’ve just been on a ridforce 
penetration, that’s all. I thought you 
were an ace operator!” 

“Yeah . Yeah, I remember. 
I was trying out your damned in- 
vention for Whitcliffe. Sure. That’s 
it.” 

“You are a member of ridforce 
internal security. You — ” 

“I know who I am! Just caught 
me on a sore spot, coming at me 
like that. If it had been me I’d have 
flicked the knife around, stuck it in 
the Withit’s own guts!” 

“We had no control over the 
murder we’d be asked to monitor, 
Lines.” Tzombe spoke smoothly. 
“But it seems pretty clear our de- 
vice works!” 

“It works,” Carol Burnham said 
on a breath. 

When Whitcliffe walked in with 
his impersonal aura of absolute com- 
mand, Lines was back to his usual 
ruthless toughness. Whitcliffe said: 
“You are feeling quite well?” 
“Quite well, sir. Haven’t been on 
a ridmach penetration for some 
time. Threw me a little. But I’m 
okay.” 

“If some of our eager-beaver 
trainees could talk to you now, 
Lines, they might understand a little 
better why we are so strict in our 
choice and training of operators.” 



“But,” put in Tzombe, “the cases 
of near-insanity go down with every 
course, I’m glad to say.” 

“They still occur. Being a rid- 
force operator leads all too easily 
to instability and insanity. It’s the 
price we pay for doing our job.” 
Ordinary words, commonplace 
sentiments. But Carol saw with a 
shiver that Whitcliffe meant every 
one with a superhuman truth. Noth- 
ing would stand in the way of this 
man. He would crush all opposition. 

“I want full scale production of 
this device. I want every patrol ho- 
vercar equipped so they can save 
the hovervans time. With the D. L. 
zeroing them in on the D. Z. they 
will be there much quicker. I sug- 
gest we call this device the R.R.I.D.” 
That fitted. R for Recording. Re- 
cording Resurrection Investigation 
Detection. R.I.D. Ridmech. Ridforce. 

Everybody called it the Carol 
Mark One. That soon became the 
Carmo. 

Production began in secret rid- 
force workshops and after she had 
turned over the fruits of her work, 
Carol suffered a panicky moment 
of emptiness. What of the future? 

So far there had never been a 
man in her life. Perhaps now she 
regretted that. 

VII 

I n the days following his penetra- 
tion on the Farish case Robin 
Carver went through the strange and 
heady experience of finding a pur- 
pose in life outside ridforce. 

Not to go to the bureau and ask 
about Chris Mellor was the obvious 



128 



IF 




decision to make. He’d always been 
a loner. Perhaps if he’d had a reli- 
able man, like Chris Melior or Stan 
Eames, to work with most of the 
time, he wouldn’t have gone to 
pieces when his wife walked out. 
Wendy had been a responsibility 
he’d welcomed. But she hadn’t been 
able to keep him from receiving the 
big red ‘Unstable’ stamp on his 
bureau files. 

The bureau had tried to steer him 
towards the space program; but he 
had thankfully declined. Even he, a 
star agent of the Americas, loathed 
working outside the Shield. He sus- 
pected the fear of foreign climes 
infecting the continent was one of 
the mainsprings of the lack of pro- 
gress in the space race. Who wanted 
to leave the Shield and go to the 
Moon? Who wanted to leave the 
Shield at all? 

He’d been out, of course, in line 
of duty. The experience had been 
stimulating, like hanging by your 
toenails over a thousand-foot drop. 
Not pleasant; but undeniably an ex- 
perience. 

He carried on with his ridforce 
work, making some first class pene- 
trations. The idea of lying beside a 
dead man and entering his mind to 
sit and watch all that had happened 
to him still gave him a shivery dis- 
believing thrill. The Withits and 
Slashers went on their killing-for- 
kicks way. Business was brisk. 

More than ever he felt convinced 
something was brewing behind the 
scenes of ridforce activity. Rumors 
of a new device, called a carmo, 
filtered down spreading alarms of 
mass redundancies. Then, after a 



hectic day’s work — four penetra- 
tions — standing dialing a hovertaxi 
he saw a taxi flit toward him, hesi- 
tate and then pick up a man standr 
ing on the higher pedway. 

Shrugging off the annoyance, Car- 
ver dialed again. A second taxi part- 
ed from the traffic stream and slid 
across. The first taxi passed within 
a few feet. 

Sitting in it was one of the men 
who had tumbled through that ebon 
door, lasciviously embracing the 
pseudo-Wendy. Carver felt absolute- 
ly sure of it. 

H e stumbled into his own taxi. 

He hesitated momentarily over 
the directions he should give. He 
could not alert the police . 

“Follow that taxi ahead,” he said 
to the robot. The radar locked on. 
Wherever the first taxi went the sec- 
ond would follow. 

He felt an eerie elation. What- 
ever was going on, he remained ab- 
solutely sure, this man ahead must 
know something of it. 

But why was Chris Melior at that 
party? 

The taxi ahead leaped across the 
city and dropped down to a medium 
level landing platform on the Foren- 
sic Science Building. 

Evening shadow purpled under the 
overheads as the man walked brisk- 
ly through a discreet entranceway. 
Carver followed. All thoughts of 
challenging the man vanished. Now 
he wanted to know the fellow’s busi- 
ness. Outside a plainly varnished 
door the man knocked. The door 
opened, he entered and the door 
dosed after him. 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN

Why in this building, of all 
places? Why in the city headquarters 
of ridforce? Maybe — just maybe 
this man could explain why Lines 
had seemed to know so much that 
should have been locked in a dead 
man’s brain, unreachable by a rid- 
mach! 

Had Carver still been an AA man 
there would have been no difficulty 
picking up the faint murmur of con- 
versation beyond that door; he 
would have been equipped with all 
manner of bugs and spies. Now he 
had to strain to try to catch the 
words. 

“It’s all set up, boss.” That was 
the thug. “The syndicate will take 
as many as you can produce.” 

“Mumble . mumble . very 
good. Deliveries . caution. Re- 
member!” The dull voice of the sec- 
ond man strengthened. “We cannot 
affoid a single mistake!” 

The voices died and Carver stood 
with one ear against the wood, tan- 
talized, not sure what to do . 

“Why, Mr. Carver! What on earth 
are you doing?” 

C arver straightened and swiveled 
as though gripped and twisted 
by a wrestler. Standing looking at 
him with the surprised expression 
of a woman seeing a man in a 
ladies’ toilet was Carol Burnham. 
She wore evening clothes under an 
off-white smock. 

“Huh?” said Carver, very intelli- 
gently. 

“It is Mr. Carver, isn’t it? Of 
course. We met at an operator and 
scientist conference, I think.” 
“That’s right.” Carver looked at 



Carol Burnham and liked what h# 
saw. She’d been distant and unap- 
proachable, he remembered. In his 
own clam-tight fashion he had bare- 
ly nodded at the introductions. Alec 
Durlston had been there, and that 
had soured the evening. Durlston 
had been very attentive to this 
Doctor Burnham, too. 

But right now he felt in a very 
false position. He couldn’t explain. 

Carol said: “What are you doing 
eavesdropping outside Whitcliffe’s 
door?” 

“Whitcliffe!” 

The murmur of voices approach- 
ed, thickening from beyond the 
door — Whitcliffe’s and the thug’s! 

“Look, Doctor Burnham,” he said 
desperately. “I’d like to talk to 
you — ” 

The door opened. 

“I’m doing the syndicate a favor, 
Zeuke, so remember that and make 
sure they pay up promptly.” Then 
Whitcliffe saw Carol and Carver. 
“Why, Doctor Burnham. You wish- 
ed to see me?” 

At once Carol recalled the reason 
for her visit. “Yes, Whitcliffe. I 
thought you should know at once. 
When I checked through the stock- 
pile of — uh — I discovered at least 
a thousand are missing. I certainly 
signed no indent for them. Neither 
did Doctor Tzombe.” 

“I signed the indent myself. We 
are beginning distribution. But it 
was good of you, Doctor Burnham, 
to be so — ah — faithful in your 
guardianship.” 

The man called Zeuke said: 
“Good evening,” and, turning ab- 
ruptly, walked off down the corridor.

The shot came from the direction 
of the landing platform. He was 
running towards it before he’d had 
time to analyze his own feelings. 
The gun was an ordinary solid-pro- 
jectile job, automatic by the flat 
crack of it, and not the needle-gun 
that shattered a man’s neutral sys- 
tem at a touch. He went through the 
last couple of doorways flat out, 
skidding to a sliding halt at the 
corner of the landing platform. Car- 
ol skittered after him. 

A man lay sprawled like a broken 
sparrow on the platform. Zeuke was 
just springing into his taxi, still 
grasping the heavy black automatic 
in one hand. 

He whipped around, triggered a 
shot at Carver. The bullet made a 
mess of an aluminum architrave. 
Carver hit the floor. The taxi whin- 
ed and belched black smoke, then 
shot away to be lost at once in the 
traffic pattern. 

Carol panted up, blowing. 
“What — ?” 

“This will be on the D.L. now,” 
Carver said. He bent down to look 
at the man’s face, twisted lax 
against the flooring. “This is like 
old times. I’ve stood at Death Zero 
a few times before — ” 

But he didn’t finish the sentence. 
The old times tag fitted here, too. 

“Stan Eames,” he said softly, 
whispering it so Carol didn’t pick 
up the words. “He’s dead. There’s 
only one thing left for a ridforce 
operator to do now.” 

Carol surprised him. She slipped 
a little pack from her pocket and 
adjusted sensing lobes to Eeame’s 
temples. 



“Quite a device,” she said. “We 
call them carmos. Since Whitcliffe 
told us he’s beginning their issue 
there’s no harm you seeing one 
ahead of time.” She leaned over 
and adjusted the controls, switched 
on. They both leaned back from the 
body and stared at each other as 
the little machine whickered softly 
away to itself, storing all the me- 
mories that had been Stanley Eames. 

She outlined the carmo’s function 
swiftly to Carver. “We can store 
information faster than an operator 
can absorb it. Machine and man, 
again.” She was reacting very well. 
Carver decided. She might deal in 
death every day; but that was a 
scientific, laboratory, pickled sort of 
death and not the violent bloody 
painful death sprawled out here. 

Down at ridforce headquarters the 
ruby light of Tentoki the demon lan- 
tern bearer would be blinking on a 
city map in a hovervan and a crew 
would be hurtling through the city 
with all afterburners on. But here 
at D.Z. a new little gadget sat like 
a spider, calmly plucking everything 
that rushing hovervan would want 
to know from the dead brain of the 
victim. Progress, that was. 

“You didn’t see — ?” 

“No,” lied Carver, “Anyway, 
your carmo will give it to us. But 
why here? Why on this platform just 
now? That is always the question 
that tantalizes. Why is death found 
just where it is found?” 

“This could be another in these 
senseless juvenile slayings,” Carol 
said with distaste. “They’re spread- 
ing” 

“The kids are murdering for kicks

IF 




these days. I know. It stinks. But 
there’s something wrong with our 
whole setup. Everybody’s gone sour.” 
The conversation fitted the empty 
mood of the moment. 

“I think I’ve felt that for some 
time. Most people do. But we all 
try not to think about it, really think, 
I mean. While we have the Shield 
(to whom be all the praise and 
thanks) what is there that can harm 
us? We just go on from day to day 
doing the same things, trying to 
make a shape out of life.” 

“Making a shape out of life.” He 
watched the shrinking tape on the 
feed spool and the whirring discs 
of light spinning out the web that 
was taking a dead man’s memories 
and recording them for a posterity 
he would never know. “That just 
about sums it up. But what sort of 
shape are we in? Where is the ob- 
ject in life? What are we all scurry- 
ing about doing? Where’s our goal?” 
“All I wanted to do was perfect 
this little gadget here. Well, I’ve 
done that. And now I feel let 
down.” 

“Perhaps everyone on the conti- 
nent is tired — ” 

“Tired of living, you mean?” 

“I don’t believe that. Everyone 
is avid for life — all the frenetic 
activity of the city proves that. But, 
somehow, to me, what they’re striv- 
ing for isn’t important. Or rather 
what they find isn’t important. Peo- 
ple want more out of life today 
than life can offer them.” 

The tape whickered to a slicing 
stop and the tiny green finish light 
went on. “That’s all we’ll get.” Carol 
switched off. 



H e felt he had known Carol 
Burnham for a long time. He 
slipped the carmo in his pocket, 
looking at her. 

He liked the way she held her 
head, her figure, the dark luster of 
her hair. She was genuine. She had 
a mind behind that smooth sweep 
of forehead capable of designing 
wondrous scientific instruments. But 
she could with equal facility worry 
over the straightness of her seams. 
A feminine electronic genius, yet! 

Carver knew it was asking a lot; 
but he asked, just the. same. In this 
quick and surprising closeness he 
felt towards her he tried to force 
a response; if he felt like this surely 
she must, too? “Look/ Carol, I’m in 
trouble. And I’m agoing to ask you 
a favor. A really big one.” 

He pointed out over the city’s* 
lights to the sudden flare and 
screechingly torturing noise blasting^ 
in purple fury from the jets of. a 
ridforce hovervan. “They’re here.” 
“What’s the favor?” ; ~ 

“The ridforce will run this poor 
chap through their ridmaCh: But I 
want to see what this is about.” ' 
“You want,” Carol said with a 
queer jolt of her heart making the 
words soft and breathy, “you * want 
to scan that carmo im your pocket? 
And you don’t want me to tell?” 
“Will you? Please?” 

Feet rapped behind them. Rid- 
force security men burst out from 
the building onto the landing plat- 
form. Lines shoved his face and his 
gun under Carver’s nose. 

“What the hell are you doing here, 
Carver? What’d you kill this guy 
for?” 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN 



133 




Some odd note in the three tur- 
^ins of the hovervan told Carver 
fee number he would see painted 
an the nose. Hovervan Number 
Three. Charlie Rawlinson began 
slinging his cameras into action as 
fee stretcher crew bundled out. 

“Come on. Carver, cough it out!” 

“I didn’t kill him, Lines, as a 
quick ridmach check will show. And 
take your bloody great gun out of 
my face!” 

Lines’ face altered subtly in its 
planes and shadows. Then, before 
he could speak, Alec Durlston start- 
ed to climb down from the hovering 
▼an. Carol gripped Carver’s arm. 

“I can vouch for that, Lines,” 
fee said firmly. “We’d just seen 
Whitcliffe and then found this poor 
man. And I’m late — ” 

Carver liked the way she’d 
brought Whitcliffe’s name in. He 
didn’t like the fact that she knew 
Lines. 

“I see,” said Lines, resenting hav- 
ing to say it. “Well, you needn’t 
hang about here any longer. If we 
need your evidence we’ll contact 
you.” 

Carver turned to Carol. “Let’s be 
going, then. I owe you a coffee.” 

“You do,” she said as they dialed 
a hovertaxi. “And you also owe me 
an explanation. I want it — all of 
itl” 

vm 

S he didn’t get all of it, of course. 

But Carver found himself tell- 
ing her much more than he had im- 
agined he would. 

In this city of sin there were 



plenty of places where couples could 
go for seclusion and still remain 
perfectly respectable. In the cheap, 
much-used room, Carver sat on the 
bed and drank auto-vended coffee. 

Carol said: “So you think some 
one is after you because you slipped 
up on a ridmach report? That’s pre- 
posterous!” 

“I didn’t say I had slipped up, 
just that Lines thinks so. He’s dan- 
gerous. And the man who commit- 
ted murder back there on the land- 
ing platform is mixed up in this.” 

“You said you hadn’t seen him!” 

“I hope you can understand 
why.” 

“I suppose you realize that Lines 
will tie me in with your nefarious 
activities now.” 

“No!” He was shattered. “He 
couldn’t!” 

“You don’t know Lines.” 

“I can guess.” 

He took out the carmo and lay 
back on the bed. Carol leaned over 
him to switch on. As she pressed the 
start button her dusky hair fell 
across his face. Her perfume en- 
closed him like a tent. 

“Just find something that will get 
us out of this mess,” she whispered. 
“Luck, Robin!” 

He hadn’t wanted to involve any- 
one else in whatever was going on; 
but now Carol had seen very clear- 
ly that she had involved herself. 
Doing that had been terrifyingly 
easy. And he liked her more than 
anyone. Wendy? Complications could 
ensue there ... 

Complications like that of child- 
birth, darkness and warmth and soft 
caressing comfort in the reassuringly

fhythmk circle of unity and then 
violent, ugly movement, dispelling, 
struggling, dryness and harshness 
and a loss of comforting darkness 
to a brilliant sword of agony. The 
first cry . 

The first cry, but not the last. 
Never the last. 

Carver skipped through Stanley 
Eames’ birth and upbringing and 
scanned perfunctorily through to the 
first years of Eames’ service as an 
agent of the Americas. An odd wry 
nostalgia possessed him as familiar 
faces and scenes passed before his 
scrutinizing eyes, behind the eyes 
erf Stan Eames. There had been three 
of them. Three buddies, three men 
dedicated to all the ideals of the 
perfect A A man. 

Stan Eames . 

Chris Mellor . 

Robin Carver. 

So that's how 1 looked then! Too 
young and fresh and cocky by half! 

C carver skipped on ahead through 
^ Eames’ memories, working his 
way in from the birth end of the 
spectrum, as Carol had said he 
would. 

He had forgotten nothing of the 
days with Eames and Mellor as an 
agent of the Americas. Stan Eames 
had forgotten nothing either. Their 
two reports of facts tallied micro- 
scopically. But the difference in in- 
terpretation — the way Eames look- 
ed at their problems, the nuances 
he had picked up that Carver had 
missed and those he had missed 
that Carver had seen — these other 
dimensions and colorings of exper- 
ience rendered their two reactions 



in totally different lights. A sober- 
ing thought, almost ominous. Even 
eidetic memories could not unfail- 
ingly tailor the emotions of mem- 
ories, only blank off what could 
not be remembered without shame. 

This personal comparison of two 
eidetic memories in one person’s 
brain was surely setting some new 
record? 

Old friends crossed the stage of 
remembrance as those three friends 
finished out their training schedules. 
Carver deliberately bypassed the sick 
period in his own life, knowing 
Eames* sympathetic reactions could 
not be borne now. 

When he rejoined, Eames stood 
trim and straight before an expec- 
tant line of newly-fledged AA men. 
Now they would run their finals 
with trouble and strife shot at them 
from all angles by men like Stan 
Eames and Chris Mellor and Robin 
— No; no more for Carver. By this 
time along Eames’ life-line he was 
marked ‘Unstable’. 

“You have been posted here to 
polish up on your finals.” Eames 
glared along the ranks — a friendly 
glare, but one which said he was 
hell - on - wheels to anyone who 
thought they could stay out of line. 
“You are now agents of the Ameri- 
cas. This means you are dedicated 
through your own free choice to 
one objective in life. That sole and 
single objective is the continuance 
in being of the Shield. That and 
nothing more.” 

Stan Eames was thinking of the 
time he had stood in ranks and 
heard this from a scarred and vet- 
eran agent. 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN

"You protect the Shield. You pro- 
tect the Shield above and beyond 
the call of any mundane duty, to 
the limits of endurance — and be- 
yond. If the continuance in being 
of the Shield demands your lives 
they will be given willingly. Gladly. 
Gratefully.” 

As Stan gave his life an hour 
or so ago . 

“Some of you may have thought 
of yourselves as a kind of modern 
continuation of the old G-men. This 
is not so. You do not serve the gov- 
ernment. You serve only to protect 
the Shield. The interests of the gov- 
ernment are secondary to the in- 
terests of the Shield — which are 
the interests both of the country 
and the government.” 

W ithin the context of modern 
life, safe and secure behind 
the Shield, where governments 
could operate only within that 
framework for life, this made sim- 
ple common sense. No one thought 
to question it. Anyway, what ques- 
tions could you ask? The Shield 
made life in this modern thermo- 
nuclear warfare dominated world 
possible and pleasant. And no gov- 
ernment had been able to guaran- 
tee that before the Shield. 

Women didn’t mind having babies 
after the Shield. 

And they didn’t worry over the 
radioactive content of the milk they 
fed them. 

. And men knew their sons would 
never have to face either the holo- 
caust of total war or the equally 
death-dealing finality of a limited 
brushfire war. 



The Shield was worth fighting for, 
far more than the so-called Peace 
that frittered away the nerves and 
robbed the taxpayers* pockets for 
armaments that ever more terrified 
in their complexity and inhumanity 
of destruction. 

There had been opposition to the 
Shield in its early days, incredible 
though that now seemed. The ever- 
hungry warmongers had protested 
bitterly that no such thing as a total 
defense had or ever could exist. 

But the Shield proved them 
wrong. Most countries of the world 
now either possessed nuclear wea- 
pons or knew where to obtain them. 
Some countries had nobly renounced 
the bomb or refused to countenance 
its incorporation into their defense 
systems. 

But a few countries had tried the 
old trick of sliding thermonuclear 
bombs in tiny fragments through the 
country’s customs, camouflaged in 
radiological equipment or souvenirs 
or any of a hundred other unlikely 
places. 

The first agents of the Americas 
picked those up. The bureau be- 
came strong fighting that sort of 
challenge. Nothing like that existed 
now. As far as anyone knew, the 
world lived peacefully together out- 
side the Shield. Not that people 
bothered much about what happen- 
ed outside the Shield. 

But there were still weird off-beat 
conspiracies to uncover, nuts who 
wanted to assassinate the president 
or blow up the Shield’s generators 
or commit any of the crimes battle- 
starved men of action are prone to. 

On the trail of one such con-

IF 




•piracy Stan Fames and Chris Mel- 
kr were working with a girl opera- 
tive, Rusty Lowke. Eames was back- 
op man. Rusty was a tall, lanky girl, 
angular-faced and with a karate 
throw that could break a bull’s neck. 

Watching and waiting with his 
two comrades, Carver felt a heart- 
stopping regret that the old days 
had gone. Here the three of them 
were again working on a case. He 
didn’t forget that he had been tra- 
ditionally a singleton; now he re- 
membered the good times they’d 
had together. 

M It’s all fixed,” Rusty said buoy- 
antly as their hovercar soughed 
through the traffic lanes. ‘‘We’ll be 
admitted without trouble. Just try to 
act the tough heavies of sin city — 
it shouldn’t be too tough.” 

“Compliments, yet,” said Mellor, 
smiling. 

The hovercar took them down to 
a landing platform perched high 
against a craggy building. At once 
they plunged into a world of luxury 
and ostentatious good-living they 
despised — and that Carver recog- 
nized with a sudden jump of excite- 
ment 

He went hidden behind the watch- 
ful eyes of Stan Eames into that 
familiar over-ripe world of pleas- 
ure . where very soon now 
Harry would be bringing Julie Farish 
and the girls. 

44 X/'our partner doesn’t seem to 
I be around, Chris.” Stan 
Barnes held Rusty’s elbow as they 
went through the door. 

“It was thoughtful of the bureau 
to assign me a girl friend to make 



up the foursome.” Chris Mellor 
stared around with his friendly smile. 

Past the waiting room they went, 
the room where soon Julie would 
wait, pushing her shoes off to be 
more comfortable. Up to the ebon 
door they went, the door flaunting 
its silver escutcheon and its gorgeous- 
ly barbaric golden bolt heads and 
flanges. 

Carver waited in the' mind of Stan 
Eames, knowing that here lay his 
chance to understand what had been 
happening to him. 

Here in this lavish room license 
held full sway. All the giggling para- 
phernalia of luxurious orgies was old 
stuff to Carver; he’d seen it many 
times before. He could feel the same 
distaste as Eames, as the agent stared 
about on the scintillating costumes, 
the flash of white flesh, the bewild- 
ering coruscations of jewels, the 
whole sybaritically organized pleas- 
ure palace. Giggle-gas balloons 
plopped and Eames moved away, 
drawing Rusty with him, so that for 
a space they lost Mellor. 

When Zeuke approached, Carver 
was not surprised. 

‘‘The meeting will take place 
shortly,” Zeuke said. The gun didn’t 
show more than a half-hairsbreadth 
beneath the impeccable suit. That 
was exactly a half-hairsbreadth too 
much for an agent. 

“Thanks.” 

Zeuke moved away. The two 
agents stared upon the animated 
throng and the miasma of smoke 
and perfume, the heady scents of 
rare wines and costly cigars, the 
whole whing-ding shooting match 
that represented life as it was lived

in this day and age on this conti- 
nent. 

“Look at all the fat slobs.” Eames 
kept a politely bland smile on his 
face. “Living high on the hog, like 
opulent princes in the city.” 

“Living,” said Mellor from be- 
hind them. “Living at all because of 
the Shield. If the Shield — if — well, 
they’d turn into a pack of insanely 
screaming fear-crazed lunatics.” 

“You’re only alive by the grace 
of the Shield (to whom all glory 
and honor and gratitude.” A new 
voice spoke from beside Mellor, soft 
and mellifluous — a voice Carver 
knew! And still Stan Eames did not 
turn around. 

“We don’t refer to the Shield in 
lay terms among ourselves,” Mellor 
said gently. 

Eames began to turn around. 
Rusty was smiling warmly, welcom- 
ing the new girl. 

“Don’t worry about Chris. We all 
have to learn.” 

“Of course.” And then Eames had 
turned fully about, and there was 
Wendy. 

O nly, of course, it wasn’t Wendy. 

Carver knew it wasn’t. Wendy 
had been at the Home when this 
party took place. She was there 
now, in the present that encompass- 
ed this party, vouched for by the 
mistresses.' This girl in her demure- 
ly-outrageous Minoan dress was not 
Wendy. She couldn’t be. 

Could she? 

“This is Zoe Brown,” said Mellor. 
Zoe Brown took Stan Eames’ 
hand in a friendly grip, looking up 
at him. A frown dashed abruptly 



across her face. Her grip slackened 
and then tightened. Her eyes cloud- 
ed and she shivered her bare shoul- 
ders. 

“What is it, Zoe?” 

“Nothing. I — just thought — I 
haven’t met you before, have I? 
Well, then, I couldn’t have recog- 
nized you.” 

But she looked troubled. 

Looking at her out of the eyes 
of Stan Eames, Carver tried to hold 
on to that central theme. This girl 
was not, could not be Wendy. 

Zoe said: “So we’re here because 
Rusty convinced her contact we’re 
deep degenerate crooks of the un- 
derworld.” 

“Something like that, Zoe. All 
you do is stick with me. You’re hew 
to learn. There may be an assign- 
ment, too.” 

Unobtrusively, people drifted from 
the hectic perfume-washed atmo- 
sphere of the party into a smaller 
rear room where chairs faced a small 
stage. Eames looked around at the 
people waiting. So, too, did Robin 
Carver. He recognized Zeuke and 
the other man with him who would 
soon dance out of the ebon door 
with Zoe Brown. Most of these peo- 
ple looked respectable and all look- 
ed prosperous but Carver under- 
stood very well they purveyed vice. 
They represented a cross-section of 
the city’s vice rings, the syndicates. 
The party outside afforded gay cam- 
ouflage. 

A man walked briskly in, jumped 
onto the stage and waited for si- 
lence. 

Staring through a dead man’s 
eyes at him, Carver felt another

little piece drop into this deadly 
jigsaw. It was Lines. 

L ines said: “You’ve been asked 
here tonight to hear a propo- 
sition of mutual benefit. You’ve 
been taken care of?” 

A rumble signified assent. A 
flashy, thin-faced shark stood up 
abruptly. “We’ve had the fun and 
games. What about the business?” 
“You all know business is bad 
lately. Oh, sure, grown-ups still pat- 
ronize your — ah — wares. But what 
about the kids?” 

What the meeting thought about 
teenagers didn’t bear repetition. They 
all agreed that the kids just were 
not paying the same rich rewards 
as previously. 

‘The reason — ” Lines overrode 
the comments — “is that they have 
found a new kick. They are getting 
hopped on murder!” 

He quieted their protests. “Oh, 
not so many. Not a lot — yet! But 
we know unexplained murders are 
being committed on a rising scale. 
A gang of kids go out on the city, 
fin a mug, a non-personality, and 
they kill him. A lot share in that 
experience. A lot more share in it 
second-hand. They have their ways. 
They seem to derive satisfaction 
from the smell of death. It gets into 
their blood.” 

“That’s an old phenomenon,” ob- 
served a slim triggerman by the 
door. “It feels good to kill.” 

“And the cops aren’t doing a 
goddam thing.” 

“How can they?” Lines smiled 
evilly. “These killings are aimless, 
motiveless. But they bring satisfac- 



tion to the killers, satiating some 
yearning, some desire, that your 
businesses fail to provide.” 

They didn’t like that. 

“What should we do then?” de- 
manded the shark nastily. “Provide 
goons to be killed off if you buy 
a ticket?” 

“Not quite!” The snap in Lines* 
voice and his tone shook them. 
They stared at him wonderingly. 

“What is this?” demanded a 
flushed man from the back. “If 
you’re going to offer us humanoid 
robots to be killed off for kicks, 
think again. We tried that. It didn’t 
work.” 

Lines quieted the hubbub. Speak- 
ing calmly, he explained what he in- 
tended to do. 

He brought his listeners manna 
from their own evil heaven. Added 
up, it was very simple. Lines was 
offering these dregs of the city's 
vice empires the opportunity to buy 
carmos — R.R.I.D.’s — and hire 
them out. The kids — anybody for 
that matter — could penetrate into 
the mind of a person as that person 
was murdered. 

That was what ridforce operators 
did. They were trained for the job. 
Now Lines proposed letting loose a 
flood of ridmechs in the city so that 
youngsters could drug themselves 
with the sensations of death. 

The scheme made Carver fed 
sick. 

Of course, Lines called the car- 
mos merely devices. He mentioned 
no names and quoted mythical 
scientific contacts. 

Eames reacted with profound 
shock. Mellor said softly: "This 

IW 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN 




must be just about the ultimate in 
vicarious experiences!” 

The meeting broke up with pro- 
mises made and delivery schedules 
tentatively organized. This, then, ex- 
plained what Zeuke and Lines had 
been up to, the conversation with 
Whitcliffe, the thousand carmos 
missing from the stockrooms, Carol’s 
vague suspicions. The forensic 
science headquarters of the police 
were being used to manufacture a 
new and vicious form of pleasure for 
the underworld the police were 
sworn to destroy. 

And Whitcliffe — the head of rid- 
force — had to be a partner in this 
diabolical scheme! 

IX 

O n the bed this strange man Rob- 
in Carver lay breathing in long 
shallow breaths. Sitting here, she had 
tried to understand herself and fol- 
low her reasons for doing what she 
had. She had for the moment over- 
come the fear that had shaken her 
brutally when she envisaged what 
Lines would do when he found out 
she had lied to him. Even Whitcliffe 
could not save her then. 

The very rapidity of events since 
die had met Carver had left her lit- 
tle time to think. Now she found 
herself thinking of Carver. Why was 
At attracted to him in a way that 
all of Alec Durlston’s undoubted 
masculine charms could not match? 
She wanted to know Carver better. 
She wanted — 

The door handle moved. 

She wrenched her body around 
to face the door, one hand at her 



throat. No one could open that door 
apart from herself and Carver. The 
ident key lay in his pocket. Without 
that the door was sacrosanct. 

But the door handle moved. It 
turned, and a slit of light slashed 
across the carpet. 

She stifled her cry. Knowing the 
risk she was making Carver take 
only made her actions more precise 
as she pressed the green finish but- 
ton and switched off the carmo. The 
sizzling of the tapes died to silence. 

Into that silence the creak of the 
door and the hoarse suppressed 
breathing of the man slowly push- 
ing his way in broke with an ugly 
violence. 

B ack in the memories of a dead 
man, the meeting had broken 
up. They were circulating about the 
party, in it and yet not of it. 

“You saw those two gorillas flank- 
ing the stage, Zoe?” Mellor spoke 
gently. 

“Yes. Ugly customers.” 

“I think Rusty will have to work 
on the character who did the talk- 
ing. Will you see what you can get 
out of his two bodyguards?” 

She made a face — the sort of 
face Wendy used to make when 
Carver reminded her the last day 
of holidays was over — but nodded. 
“All right. I’ll see what Mata Hari 
can do. You’ll be around, though? 
Just in case.” 

“I’ll be around, Zoe.” 

This was a rotten sort of business. 
But it had to be accepted if the 
country were to be kept clean. 
Eames watched Zoe Brown move 
gracefully through the throng, per- 



140 



IF 




fectly composed, laughing gaily as 
she ducked giggle-gas balloons, kick- 
ing free of multi-colored ribbons. 
She’d do. She was an agent of the 
Americas on a job. 

The two bodyguards moved to- 
wards a giggling mass of men and 
women. Zoe disappeared into the hi- 
jinks at their side. Eames didn’t 
know one of those men was called 
Zeuke, he didn’t know that the girl 
Zoe would soon prance through the 
ebon door with them to be momen- 
tarily seen by Julie Farish as Pritch- 
ard dragged her away. 

The whole scene wavered like 
a film waved beneath water. The 
noise dimmed. The scents faded He 
struggled wildly to return, to re- 
create the moment passed, to inhabit 
once again, the mind of Stan Eames. 
Then the blackness and the whorls 
of dark-light anti-color whirled about 
him. 

Someone was shaking his shoulder 
gently. A hand was across his mouth, 
the fingers and thumb biting be- 
tween his teeth, stretching the flesh. 
A voice whispered desperately. 

“Wake up, Robin! For Godk’s sake 
come back!” 

In automatic response he tried 10 
speak but the hand over his mouth 
dug in more cruelly. The speaker’s 
lips touched his ear, the words bare- 
ly heard. 

“I had to bring you back! You’re 
Robin Carver. You’re in a room 
with me, Carol Burnham — and 
there’s a man breaking in the door!” 

H e put a hand up and caught her 
arm. He pressed, hard, three 
times. Then he moved the hand to 



her fingers over his lips. Slowly, the 
gripping constriction eased. 

Her head bent over him. 

Tm okay. Fm Robin Carver. A 
man — breaking in?” 

He looked at the door past the 
curve of her shoulder. 

A sliver of light fell athwart the 
carpet 

Slowly, inch by inch, the light 
broadened. The goon was taking 
no chances of disturbing them. 

“This might be just the regular 
Caves of Joy routine,” he whispered 
harshly. “But — it might not.” 

Carefully he crawled out of the 
bed and moved noiselessly towards 
the door. One second he had been 
circulating at an orgy and searching 
for signs of a conspiracy; the next 
he was creeping out of bed in a 
darkened room about to deal with 
an intruder. They’d said you had to 
be flexible to be a ridforce operator; 
but this type of flexibility was more 
suited to an agent of the Americas. 

He reached the door and stood 
quite still behind it. 

With spine-jolting brutality the 
door cracked open. Tear-jerking light 
splashed acridly across the bed. 
Bunched muscles beneath dark coat 
over broad gorilla shoulders moved 
into the room, black-outlined and 
menacing, between Carver and the 
light. He could hear the hoarse 
hacking breathing and see light splin- 
tering from the hairs on the gorilla's 
necks and ears. 

“Awri! Git outta the bed!” 

This wasn’t Zeuke. This was his 
companion. This was the man Zoe 
Brown had been ordered to investi- 
gate — and just how had that turn-

ed out? What was Zoe Brown doing 
now? 

“What’s going on!” Carol didn’t 
need to put on an act. She was scar- 
ed right through. “He’s got a gun!” 
But she still had guts enough to 
scream a warning. 

Carver reached around the goril- 
la’s back and cut the edge of his 
palm down on the man’s wrist, just 
where the bones jutted, just where it 
hurts the most. Before the gorilla’s 
sharp yelp of pain cut through 
Carol’s words, before the gun thunk - 
ed to the ground, Carver cut the 
goon across the side of his neck 
with the edge. For good measure, 
he kicked him as he went down, in 
the place where it would do the most 
good. The gunman sprawled on the 
carpet — out. 

Carol breathed. “You don’t waste 
much time.” 

Carver bent, picked up the gun. 
“Can’t afford to.” He checked the 
weapon. Solid projectile automatic. 
A load of old-fashioned slobs he’d 
tangled with this time, at that. 
“Come on. This place is blown.” 

“Don’t forget the carmo.” She 
dropped it into her purse. “I’ve 
never seen anyone come out of a 
penetration so fast before.” 

“You have to adapt. You had 
good reason to drag me out. Any- 
way, I found out what I want to 
know — until the next stage. I didn’t 
go through to Stan’s death . .” 

Out on the landing they avoided 
the elevator shaft and skipped down 
the first flight. Carol paused, a 
hand to her side. 

A bullet splashed against the plas- 
tic panelling above them. 



The second bullet would have 
passed clean through Carol if Car- 
ver hadn’t head-down charged her 
back out of the line of fire from 
the stair landing beneath. 

T hrough the balustrade Carver 
could see part of the arm and 
shoulder of the gunman below. It 
wasn’t Zeuke. He pushed the gun 
down, fired, then whipped around 
the corner of the stairs fast, jump- 
ing down five at a time, to slam 
the gun-butt into the man’s chin as 
he sagged, clasping his shattered 
shoulder. Carver called back up the 
stairs: 

“Come on, Carol! Snap it up. I 
want this goon.” 

They manhandled the unconscious 
thug into the elevator and rode him 
down to the first landing-platform 
floor. Only when he had dialed a 
robo-taxi and dumped the man in, 
with Carol and himself squashed on 
the opposite seat, could he relax. 

“These men have been sent by 
Lines to kill us. When he scanned 
Eames’ memories he found out 
about me — enough to want me 
dead.” 

“But why? You must have — ” 

“I must have nothing. You won’t 
understand this; but I’ll tell you what 
I haven’t told a living soul for years. 
I used to be an agent of the Ameri- 
cas. Oh, don’t gape! You haven’t 
heard of them; but Lines has. He’ll 
think I’m still working for the bu- 
reau. And we’re opposed to what 
he’s doing.” Carver told Carol what 
was intended for her carmos. She 
listened in shocked and hostile si- 
lence.

“Not any more, Carol. I admire

“It all makes sense, though, f’ve

sour, especially the youngsters. And 
the experience they get of kilhng 
someone is surely only a pale reflec- 
tion of that they get being killed. 
That’s an old psychological conun- 
drum.” 

The man on the opposite seat

groaned and stirred. Carver prodded 
Y' -n with his own gun. 

“Wake up, sonny. Where is Whit- 

cliffe?” 

“Get lost, mac. I ain’t gonna tell 
you.” The gorilla shifted around, 
winced as the pain hit him. 

Carver thrust his face an to the 
other’s, gripping his collar in a 
tightly bunched fist. He felt abso- 
lutely ruthless. “You know what 
businesses we’re in. We make dead 
men tell tales! I want to know where 
Whitcliffe is, and if you know you’ll 
tell me. Otherwise I shall kill you 
and find out for myself the easy 
way. It’s your choice — mac.” 
Staring down with a shifty illu- 
mination from the city parti-color- 
ing her face, Carol knew Carver 
would do it, too. 

Whitcliffe’s man knew that too. 
He could see it in Carver’s eyes. “I 
dunno where he went.” 

“That can be checked, too. After 
you’re dead.” 

Carver began to wonder what it 
would be like to be in the mind of a 
victim he killed himself — victim 
and executioner in one. 

The guard broke. 

“You bastard,” he began, crying 
with the wrath of being beaten. 

Carver flicked a backhand across 
the fellow’s mouth. “Keep your 
filthy sewer-mouth to yourself. 
There is a lady present. Talk!” 

“New Mexico. That’s where he’s 
gone. Somewhere in New Mexico.” 
Carol bent down. “But where? 
Where in New Mexico?” 

“I don’t know. And that’s the 
truth. Things are ready to start! 
That’s all I know. Don’t kill me!” 



Carver dialed the taxi to a stand, 
“Leave him,” he told Carol, and 
slugged the guard again. He caught 
her arm. They hurried away. “Come 
on Carol,” Carver said. 

Glancing at the line of his jaw, 
Carol shivered. 

X 

L os Alamos no longer looked as 
it had when men tentatively 
tinkered with the inner fires of mat- 
ter here. Above the surface showed 
only the shallow rounded dome of 
a fallout shelter elevator shaft. They 
stood in the dust and coolness of 
the night, their hired hovercar silent 
behind them, staring and wondering 
at that simple dome. 

Carol caught her breath. “And 
you mean it’s here? Right under our 
feet now? Incredible!” 

“We’ve been spotted on radar and 
seismic alarms by now. Pretty soon 
the welcoming committee will call 
on us. Just remember; act naturally, 
show no wavering. We must con- 
vince them we know what we’re 
talking about.” 

“I’m glad we had that meal,” Car- 
ol observed as though irrelevantly. 
“I’m faint enough as it is.” 

Carver pressed her arm. “You’re 
going to be all right, I promise.” 
The searchlight pinned them to 
the ground. Their shadows streamed 
distorted behind them. They waited 
as men moved towards them, the 
glimmer of helmets, weapons and 
uncompromising eyes surrounding 
them. 

“You two! Don’t move.” The 
voice came chill and impersonal;

IF 




tat not loaded with hate or anger. 
“What are you doing here? Didn’t 
you read the warning notices?” 
“Yes.” Carver spoke strongly. “Is 
Morgan still around?” 

A pause. 

The night breathed quietly around 
them, warmly scented, a part of 
normal life and yet now remote, 
miles away from the situation that 
had developed here and that could 
not now halt this side of culmina- 
tion. The man sighed. “He’s here. 
Who are you?” 

“An old friend. Just say I must 
speak to him about what you are 
doing here. About what lies beneath 
us — and about a very present peril.” 
As they went down in the eleva- 
tor Carol clung to Carver. “Who is 
Morgan? What did you mean?” 
“Morgan is my old chief. He’s a 
hard man, but fair. His job insures 
he’ll listen to me.” 

P aneled in plastic and concrete, 
the underground labyrinth was 
quickly traversed. Soon they reached 
Morgan’s office. 

Carver stared about with a wry 
twitch to his lips, savoring the feel 
and atmosphere of the place. It 
hadn’t changed. Neither had Morgan 
to outward seeming. 

“So it’s you, Robin.” Morgan 
stood up and reached out a hand. 
Carver shook and once again the 
old feeling returned. He knew he 
had no time now to indulge in no- 
stalgia — or ironic self-pity, or even 
a comradely spirit of revenge and 
triumph. He could only do his job. 

Even if Morgan and the bureau 
had thrown him out. 



“It*s a long story, Morg. First 
thing — has Whitcliffe been here? 
Have you got foolproof tabs on 
him?” 

“Whitcliffe? Of course he’s here. 
What’s the story, Robin? It had 
better be good.” 

“Oh, it’s good. But just put a 
triple check on Whitcliffe.”. 

“Why the hell should I?” Morgan 
flashed sarcasm. “Because you say 
so? A man who was found unstable 
by the bureau and now, years after- 
wards, comes suddenly back de- 
manding it? Who are you compared 
with Whitcliffe?” 

“Umm,” said Carver, too concern- 
ed with what he must do to feel 
hurt. “I’ll just say this. You’ll not 
only put a triple check on Whit- 
cliffe — you’ll probably send out a 
five-star red alert to arrest before 
I’m halfway through.” 

Morgan grunted scornfully; but 
he lay back in his chair. 

Carver told him the lot. Every- 
thing. He kept nothing back. In one 
very real way this was a catharsis of 
his spirit, a confession, a dumping 
of his problem onto the capable 
shoulders of a man he knew would 
know the answers. 

When he reached the point where 
Whitcliffe was more than suspected 
of selling carmos illegally Morgan 
leaned forward and pressed his call 
button. “Five-star red alert. Whit- 
cliffe. On the double. I want him in 
this office in five minutes.” He 
glowered at Carver. “Go on.” 

A red light blinked on a six by 
four panel at the side. An aide 
punched the button and the light

went out. He looked up quickly. 
•That’s odd, sir. Alarm in section 
three, but no response from the 
visuals or audios.” 

“Check it out. Rod. Personally/’ 
ordered Morgan. 

The aide rose and left the office. 
Carver went on: “Whitcliffe’s use 
of carmos to recruit tough and fel- 
low-travelers who wouldn’t think too 
much and his dipping into the vice 
empires, plus one or two items I’d 
picked up here and there, convinced 
me that Whitcliffe was out to 
smash the Shield. Although I was 
forced to leave Stan Eames early 
I formed the idea that Chris Mellor, 
acting on your orders, suspected 
Lines. Stan was back-up man. He 
didn’t know all that Chris knew — 
that’s the way it figured. And Lines 
led right back to Whitcliffe.” 
“We’ve had quite a few nut cases 
since you left, Robin. These organ- 
ized gangs trying to destroy the 
Shield believe they are right and we 
are wrong. They are the most dia- 
bolically dangerous groups in exis- 
tence. And now you tell me Whit- 
cliffe is leading one of them!” 
Carol sat and listened, and the 
bottom dropped out of her world. 

Her first reaction was to whisper: 
“You mean the Shield is generated 
from here? We’re sitting right where 
the Shield (May all glory never 
cease) was born.” 

Carver smiled at her. “The Shield 
protects the Americas from nuclear 
attack completely, Carol. But the 
electromagnetic and radiation sheaths 
have to be generated somewhere. 
They must have a locus. You’re sit- 
ting right in the heart of that now.” 



She gripped the arms of her form- 
fit so tightly they squirmed trying 
to adjust to her configuration. “And 
Whitcliffe, the man I admired above 
all others. He’s actually trying to 
destroy it all! It just doesn’t make 
sensei” 

“There’s one other item yon 
should know, Robin.” Morgan rose 
and paced. “Perhaps I should have 

told you; but you might have said 
__ *» 
no. 

Carver wondered what on earth 
his old chief was maundering about. 
And it was about time Whitcliffe 
was brought in by the guards. 

“That girl you saw, Zoe Brown . .” 
“Yes?” But he thought he knew 
now. 

“She was — uh — well I guess 
you know Chris recommended the 
Home on my orders. The mistresses 
are all agents. That’s a training 
school for agents of the Americas, 
Robin, under cover of being a nor- 
mal Home renowned over the conti- 
nent. You see — ” 

Carver felt very peculiar. A hoarse 
chuckling escaped him. “I told my- 
self! I should have known no other 
girl could be quite like that!” 
“Wendy reached the Home just 
before you called. The rocket zoom- 
ed her out again as soon as you’d 
left. We’d kept tabs on you as soon 
as our agent in ridforce reported 
that you’d gone in on the Farish 
penetration. We’ve been piecing to- 
gether all the items about this group 
for some time. But it never occurred 
to me that Whitcliffe himself could 
be the man behind it.” 

The thing that stuck in Carver’s 
mind was a warm, a proud, a tre- 



146 



IF 




mendously happy feeling that his 
only daughter was an agent of the 
Americas. She was a good egg — 
and he damned well had recognized 
her! Only the cunning and expertise 
of die bureau had fooled him. Zoe 
Brown! Nuts! 

*Td like to thank you, Robin, for 
not reporting back that you’d seen 
Chris Mellor. It could have been un- 
fortunate. As it was, they got Stan.” 
Morgan looked annoyed. “What’s 
happened to Rod? And where’s 
Whitcliffe? Check on it, Brett.” 

As the aide reached the door it 
smashed open, and two guards 
stumbled through supporting the 
drooping body of a man. 

F ir a moment Carver did not 
recognize Chris Mellor. 

Mellor looked ghastly, his waxy 
face all drawn down with pain and 
his eyes glaring from pits of bruised 
flesh. From his side where one hand 
pressed unavailingly, the dark 
bright blood seeped down. 

“Whitcliffe,” he managed to gasp 
before they eased him into a form- 
fit. “That devil Lines has double- 
crossed us. , They’re here! In the 
machine room! They’re going — go- 
ing to blow it — ” His head lolled 
and blood spittled his lips. 

Morgan headed the rush for the 
door with a snapped word: “Full 
alarm! And get help for Chris!” 

In the elevator dropping through 
a hundred floors a small hand 
reached out and laid pressing fin- 
gers along Carver’s bicep. He turned 
in shocked surprise to see Carol 
staring large-eyed up at him. 

“What — ?” he began. Then: 



“Sure. You’re entitled to be in on 
this. Just keep out of the way of 
trouble.” 

She leaned against him. Her emo- 
tions had been so tangled and torn 
lately she felt the crying need of 
someone in whom to seek rest. She 
knew now she didn’t care what. Rob- 
in Carver looked like. It was what 
he was inside himself that mattered. 
Alec Durlston’s physical allure paled 
to nothing beside that. 

The elevator halted and the gates 
slid open into actinic light. They 
entered the machine room of the 
Shield. 

The Shield, an electromagnetic 
radiation creating a field of force 
sheathing the entire Americas, con- 
sumed energy in quantities commen- 
surate with its abilities to check and 
nullify any weapon, thermonuclear 
or otherwise, thrown against the 
western hemisphere. It had saved 
mankind from itself. It had rendered 
war impossible. All the energy men 
could give it would be given willing- 
ly, gladly, at whatever cost. So it 
was Carol stared out upon only a 
small portion of the complex and 
echoingly vast underground struc- 
ture that produced the Shield. No 
single eye could encompass an en- 
tirety that colossal dynamo. Yet she 
felt bewildered, stunned, cowed and 
crushed by the skyscraper tall units, 
the unending vistas of panels, the 
dwindling perspectives. Here power 
was a live thing. 

“How can they hope to blow all 
this up?” she whispered to Carver, 
pressing eagerly on. 

“A thermonuclear bomb in the 
right place will destroy the heart and

brain.” His face shadowed with 
Impending disaster. “After that, there 
will be no more Shield.” 

Men’s shadows flitted between the 
mechanical colossi on every hand. 
The quick hateful spitting of wea- 
pons crackled past the edifices of 
electronic engineering. 

Morgan shouted, hard and high, 
“We must stop them! Spread out! 
Shoot to kill! Where the devil is 
Whitcliffe?” 

This work was of the type Car- 
ver had once trained with supreme 
dedication to perform as a perfect 
fighting machine. He knew as well 
ms any man present that he fought 
to preserve the world in peace. 

A whey-faced guard with a dan- 
gling arm stumbled up. “They’re in 
section four! They’ve set up a de- 
fense and they’re working away in 
there!” 

“Assembling the bomb.” Morgan 
cursed. Everyone rushed towards 
section four. 

“At least,” offered Carver run- 
ning beside Morgan. “We have them 
boxed in. They won’t get away now. 
So they can’t detonate the bomb — ” 

“Don’t count on it, Robin. These 
nuts all have the suicide streak. 
Good Lord above, man! They must 
have! Otherwise they wouldn’t be 
crazv enough to blow up the 
Shield!” 

XI 

D eep in section four the unmis- 
takable stink of gunsmoke hung 
in the air as men fought to get 
through to where other men were 
busily concocting an infernal device 



that would blast the heart and brains 
of the Shield. The bureau men be- 
gan to fight their way in. Men 
screamed and died. The air thicken- 
ed. The clanging reverberations of 
automatic weapons fired between re- 
sonant metal walls stung the ear- 
drums. 

Crouched down behind a block of 
instruments, Morgan and Carver 
watched as attack aftpr attack failed. 
From behind them Carol said: 
“D’you think Whitcliffe will listen to 
reason? Let me talk to him!” 

“But — ” said Morgan. 

“It’s a chance.” Carver slid his 
gun out and dropped it on the floor. 
“I’ll go in with Carol. They know us 
and we know them. They might lis- 
ten to a proposition. Somehow I 
can’t envision Whitcliffe in the sui- 
cide role. It doesn’t add up to the 
estimate I’ve formed of the man.” 
“It just can’t be Whitcliffe,” Carol 
said stubbornly. “He had everything 
to live for! Smashing the Shield — 
oh, God, what a hideous thought! 
I must speak to him!” 

The truce talk was arranged with 
surprising ease. Soon Carol and Car- 
ver, watched by a glowering Morgan 
and a mass of guards, walked stead- 
ily towards the inner entrance to 
section four, carrying a white tissue 
on a transistor portable’s telescopic 
aerial. 

“I feel like a fool walking in like 
this,” said Carver in a low voice. 

“So do I. But Whitcliffe will re- 
spect a white flag.” 

“Sure he will. It’s giving him time 
to complete the assembly and trigger 
mechanism of the bomb.” 

Expectedly, Lines met them. He

must have flown in and reported 
direct to Whitcliffe as soon as his 
men lost Carver and Carol. Zeuke 
was with him. Carver restrained the 
desire to punch them both on the 
noses. That pleasure would come 
later. “Where’s Whitcliffe?’’ 

“I ought to put a bullet in you 
here and now, Carver.” Lines look- 
ed as though the sight of Carver 
made him sick. “I suppose it’s your 
doing the plan’s gone wrong?” He 
suddenly struck out with his gun, 
aiming to slash the sight down Car- 
ver’s cheek. Carver leaned his head 
back. Then he kicked Lines. 

“All right, Zeuke!” Carver’s hand 
went up as Zeuke’s right forefinger 
whitened on the trigger. “He had 
that coming! But we’re here under a 
flag of truce.” Lines lay on the 
floor, groaning and vomiting. “Let’s 
get to Whitcliffe right away.” 

Zeuke looked uncertain. Then 
Whitcliffe’s calm, unemotional voice 
reached them. “Bring Carver along 
here, Zeuke. And Doctor Burnham, 
too. I must admit to a little surprise 
at your presence, Doctor.” 

They left lines lying on the floor. 
The others went with Whitcliffe and 
the truce party towards the inner 
sections of four, where Whitcliffe 
halted them before a small metal 
door. Beyond that door, Carver 
guessed, techs were hard at work 
assembling the bomb and its trigger. 

“It seems we have reached an 
impasse,” Carver began. “You can’t 
get away. You can’t let that bomb 
off without killing yourselves — and 
I don’t think you’re that foolish.” 

“I might just be stupid enough 
to do that, Carver.” 



T hen Carol could not stop herself 
from bursting in passionately 
with: “What did you sell my carmos 
to those horrible people for, Whit- 
cliffe? I trusted in you, believed in 
you, admired you! And then — and 
then you do a filthy despicable thing 
like that. Why?” 

“Your youthful sincerity is very 
refreshing — ” Whitclffe began with 
the palest of smiles. 

“No, Whitcliffe!” shouted Carol. 
“That won’t do any more! Don’t you 
understand? You meant everything 
that was good and fine to me, a 
man working to help humanity, 
working to try to make a better 
place of the world. And then you 
pander to the lowest, most debased 
instincts of a depraved mind!” 
“Easy, girl.” Whitcliffe moved 
away. At his side metal tanks of 
cryotron-cooling helium rose to the 
ceiling. “Let me try to explain. And 
this will answer your ultimatum, 
Carver.” 

“Go on.” 

“First of all, I am not insane. I 
am as well aware as any of you 
what the Shield has meant in the 
past to this country and to the 
world. It gave us peace. It gave us 
a breathing space, a time to free the 
shackles of fear from our minds. The 
countries from Alaska to the £Iorn, 
which we call the Americas, were 
shielded from death and destruction 
that threatened to rend us from Out- 
side.” 

“This does not explain why you 
sold carmos — ” 

“Listen, girl!” For the first time 
in her life Carol saw and heard 
Whitcliffe losing some of that fa-

mous dry composure. He was re- 
acting almost as a normal man to a 
stress that would have crushed any- 
one of lesser fiber. And then she 
castigated herself for thinking of 
Whitcliffe in the old way . 

“To deal with this point of the 
R.R.I.D.’s first. You all know that 
the Withits, the Slashers, the hosts 
of other teenage gangs have been 
enjoying themselves killing innocent 
people. A savage drenching in blood 
has given them a ghastly self-satis- 
faction. Well — I sought to stop 
that directly, and at source. If I 
tupplied carmos to these youngsters 
they would revel in the vicarious de- 
fights of murder and killing. And 
they would stop actual violence for 
themselves.” He held up a silencing 
hand. “It may have been giving in 
to trends we are sworn to oppose. 
But I was working against time. It 
served its purpose in curbing the 
fires of violence that are due to 
break over the country — unless the 
Shield is torn down.” 

“Tear down the Shield? Take 
away our sole defense?” 

“Yes! Break down the Shield. 
Open up this continent once more 
to the common intercourse of the 
whole world! That is my dream — 
and my sworn intention!” 

C arver felt bewilderment sweep 
over him like the thunderous 
blast of a storm whirling away his 
wits. “But how?” 

“How can we stop this country 
from sinking into final degradation 
and decadence? You all know the 
filthy practices that are going on. 
The murders, the seething violence. 



Not only in the city — where, thank 
God, we can exercise a measure of 
control — but now seeping out into 
the clean countryside. We are so in- 
troverted, so much a part of our own 
cesspit that we are all doomed — 
unless we can let in the clean air 
of the outside world!” 

“I grant you we’re a pretty un- 
pleasant lot,” Carver said slowly. 
“I’ve been feeling that now for some 
time. So has Carol and a whole lot 
of other people. But there are still 
plenty of decent citizens. How does 
allowing the other nations of the 
world the opportunity to blow us to 
pieces help?” 

“When China attained nuclear 
power many people felt like slitting 
their throats ahead of time. But 
there were others who did something 
about it. Oh, not wars. Wars, these 
thermonuclear days, are suicide. 
Compromise! Working out solutions. 
An understanding of the other fellow, 
no matter what his color or race or 
creed — and if this sounds like a 
corny old sermon, remember that all 
truths tend to become that — be- 
cause people are too frightened or 
too lazy and bored to do anything 
about them. If you act on a truth 
it is no longer boring or a tired old 
sermon. Only those truths that are 
not acted upon become that because 
they have to be repeated again and 
again.” 

“You mean the outside is at 
peace?” asked Carol. 

“It has been for years. A global 
communications network, mutual 
aid programs, a determination to 
make this earth support every one 
of its sons and daughters in a decent 



150 



IF 




itate of life — all these things have 
come together to make the outside 
a pretty livable place. There are 
still problems. But over the years 
we’ve been sheltering behind our 
Shield the world has passed us by. 
These are self-evident truths to any- 
one who looked for them. But our 
people dared not go outside the 
Shield to seek, because to do so ex- 
posed them. And their first thought 
when overseas was to return as soon 
as possible behind the comfort of 
the Shield.” 

Carol remembered the aircraft 
she had seen returning to the conti- 
nent and coming home through the 
Shield. The truth Whitcliffe was 
speaking broke over her in all its 
fury. She — all of them — had been 
wrong! 

4 4'lT7'e’ve been wrong all along, 

VV then?” 

“It won’t be easy to change your 
mind; but we will change the minds 
of all people — who will henceforth 
never have to cower behind an im- 
pregnable defense against a non-ex- 
istent terror.” 

Carver moved forward. “This 
sounds all fine and dandy, Whit- 
cliffe. But to me it sounds like 
treason!” 

Whitcliffe’s face showed sadly the 
feelings he had hitherto kept tightly 
bottled up. “Can’t you believe me, 
Carver? But for your meddling — - 
in a cause in which you believed and 
for which I admire you — we would 
have succeeded.” 

“What about the murders com- 
mitted to keep me from finding 
out?” ' 



“I bow my head. Lines was re- 
sponsible for the violence; but in 
the ultimate assessment I must take 
the blame.” 

“At least you’re honest! I don’t 
envy any man who takes the respon- 
sibility for Lines.” 

Zeuke made an angry step for- 
ward, like a bull tossing its horns in 
an ancient arena. 

“Sometimes even the best of in- 
tentions must be pursued with crook- 
ed tools.” 

Carver brushed that aside. He had 
to. What Whitcliffe was telling him 
meant more than a nice discussion 
of moral points. It touched upon 
the continuance of two different 
worlds: the world he had known all 
his life and come to loathe, and the 
world of promise offered him by 
Whitcliffe — if he would negate the 
whole of his life’s teachings. He 
must decide; for both worlds could 
not co-exist. 

“Everything I’ve believed in — 
turned upside down,” whispered 
Carver, more to himself than the 
others. He couldn’t look at them; 
he felt ashamed. 

Could what Whitcliffe said be 
true? Everything he had known 
about the man until so tragically a 
short a time ago would have con- 
vinced him without further argu- 
ment; but on this single subject there 
had to be doubt. No one man had 
the right to capsize his world li\e 
this. 

“Look, man,” said Whitcliffe and 
the raggedness in his voice shocked 
Carver. “You can’t crawl behind a 
wall and shut the door behind you 
— and opt out of life.” 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN 



151 




Even then Carver could not ac- 
cept what stared him in the face. He 
sensed that Carol had been convinc- 
ed by her chief. But could he? 
Could a man who had trained hard 
with the agents of the Americas to 
foil just such a plot as this — leaving 
out of account that they’d discarded 
him — could he allow himself to be 
swayed by arguments that could be 
specious? 

He nerved himself. “I’m sorry, 
Whitcliffe. I was asked to parley 
with you — to try to make you see 
the futility of your actions here, to 
ask you to defuse the bomb and 
leave quietly. I must carry out that 
assignment.” 

“I’m sorry, too, Carver. And if 
1 refuse your request?” 

“I can but go back and report. 
But I beg you, Whitcliffe — leave 
the bomb alone! Think what it will 
do!” 

“The bomb is assembled by now. 
The trigger mechanism also, I im- 
agine. This talk has not been en- 
tirely one-sided. Once I press the 
radio-command signal to go — no 
one can defuse the bomb before it 
explodes. This you know.” 

“I know.” 

A s though on cue that metal door 
opened. A girl stepped through 
carefully shutting the door behind 
her. She wore faded denims and her 
lithe body showed rounded curves 
where it pressed against the mater- 
ial. She came forward and turned 
her smooth blonde helmet of hair to 
Whitcliffe, seeing only him among 
all the others. 

“The techs have finished, Whit- 



cliffe. It’s all yours. On the radio- 
command to go — ” 

“Thank you, Miss Brown,” said 
Whitcliffe gently. 

The girl swung away, tight-faced, 
grim of jaw and eye, and in that 
instant only Carver staring with eyes 
that goggled unbelievingly saw that 
betraying tremble of her lips. This 
girl was too young to die — even 
to sacrifice her life for the good of 
the world. 

“Wendy,” Carver said, on a 
breath. He scarcely parted the air 
with the word, hoping that the girl 
would walk on, ignoring him. 

But she swung around as though 
caught in a snare. 

Her eyes widened. A hand flew 
to her mouth. The blood fled from 
that serious, beautiful, heart-wring- 
ing face. 

“Dad? Dad!” 

And then they were in each oth- 
er’s arms, fast locked, and he was 
talking to her as he had in the old 
days, calming her feverish childish 
terrors after a nightmare, stroking 
the heavy helmet of hair away from 
her forehead, crooning to her, rock- 
ing gently back and forth. 

At last Wendy sucked in a lung- 
ful of air, pushed Carver away, 
hands flat on his chest. She stared 
long and narrowly at him. The oth- 
ers watched this tiny portion of a 
greater drama as though seeing it 
compressed through the medium of 
tri-di. She brushed her hair back her- 
self and drew a deep lung-straining 
breath so that the denim creaked. 

Then: “What the blue blazes are 
you doing here?” 

“Wendy! I thought you were an 

IF 



152 




agent of the Americas! What am / 
doing here? Listen here, young lady! 
What the blue blazes do you mean 
playing around with a hydrogen 
bomb illegally?” 

“I was an agent, Dad. Morgan 
picked me out as soon as you left 
the bureau. Training started early at 
the Home. I’ve been working for the 
bureau for a long time. But as soon 
as Whitcliffe explained what he was 
doing and the reasons — well, it’s 
obvious, isn’t it? I mean — he’s told 
you and you’re here, so it’s all right. 
We’re going to blow the lid off the 
whole boiling pot of horrors this 
continent has become since we shut 
ourselves off from everybody else 
behind that dratted Shield.” 

XII 

T hat dratted Shield / Incredible! 

To speak so contemptuously 
of the Shield (To whom all glory 
and honor and gratitude, etc., etc., 
etc. .) 

No! Not any more. 

Wendy was Youth. Wendy knew 
the score. Wendy wouldn’t be suck- 
ed in by a load of specious rubbish 
spouted by a cracked demagogue 
hungry for martyrdom. In Youth lay 
the key to this whole affair; from 
the Withits and the expedient Whit- 
cliffe had dreamed up to contain 
them until the continent was opened 
to Wendy with her own dreams and 
conceptions of what life was aQ 
about. 

It made him feel old. Old, and 
a little fuzzy around the edges, as 
though he was superfluous. 

He swung on Whitcliffe. “Look 



here, Whitcliffe. We don’t want to 
be martyrs. I’m sure Carol doesn’t 
and I’m damn well going to do all 
I can to stop Wendy and Carol 
from being incinerated in a death 
zero we haven’t seen in a hundred 
years. You’ve convinced diem. I’m 
going to have a try convincing Mor- 
gan. Then maybe we can find a 
more civilized way of shutting down 
the Shield.” 

“At last!” breathed Whitcliffe. 
“You can try, Carver. I gather you 
know Miss Brown?” 

“Huh,” said Carver, in the sha- 
dow of a spectacular death still able 
to react to his daughter with pater- 
nal comic-opera. “A few years ago 
I’d have held her across my knee 
and paddled her for sneaking about 
behind her old man’s back like this.” 

“We can but try.” Whitcliffe mo- 
tioned to his gathered accomplices. 
“We will all go out, every single per- 
son. We will surrender. When we 
are well clear of the area I will 
trigger the bomb, if we have failed 
to convince Morgan of the truth. 
The truth or the bomb. One must 
be the choice.” 

On his words everyone trooped 
out under the pathetic white flag 
and were rounded up under the 
menacing guns of Morgan’s men. 
Tension crackled in the air. “That 
bomb is well hidden, Morgan,” said 
Whitcliffe serenely. “And the first 
man who tries to defuse it will trig- 
ger it all. You know a lot about 
booby traps; but you don’t know 
enough to make that bomb harmless 
in the time left. I don’t advise any- 
one to go near it” 

“Clear everyone out of the area,” 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN 



153 




shouted Morgan, in a sweat. “Get 
the bomb squad here on the double! 
Warn the surrounding areas! Every- 
one must take cover in a shelter just 
in case.” He stared viciously at 
Whitcliffe. “By God! You’ve a lot 
to answer for!” 

M en and women moved fast. 

They bundled up in the eleva- 
tor shafts and scattered out across 
the New Mexico desert in the thin 
wind of dawn, with streaks of color 
layering the horizon towards the 
east, heralding a day that might 
transform their whole lives — or 
might end as it had begun for the 
millions of the continent, save for 
the deaths of those who would be 
branded anti-Shield traitors. 

In the nearest fallout shelter Mor- 
gan slapped his men around. They 
were not gentle with the traitors. 
Carver tried to make his position 
clear and Morgan greeted him with 
“Judas!” and lined him up with the 
rest. 

To Carver’s surprise Hovervan 
Number Three turned up with Bob 
Soames and Alec Durlston aboard. 

“I’ve called in ridforce,” Morgan 
explained, “so that if I have to kill 
some of your friends to get at the 
answers I want I’ll have it done by 
experts.” 

Carver stared curiously at Durls- 
ton. The man’s face twitched. His 
eyes were white-rimmed and staring. 
His hands shook. The man was 
scared right through, and yet he was 
safe in this shelter from a hydrogen 
blast as far off as the Shield genera- 
tors. 

Gruffly, Soames said: “You’ve got 



yourself in a hell of a spot this time, 

Robin.” 

“If you fellows would listen te 
Whitcliffe you’d understand.” 

“Quiet!” snapped Morgan. “One 
of you filthy little lice is going to be 
made to tell me when the bomb is 
due to go off. And I’m not squeam- 
ish about how it’s done!” 

Staring at that incredible scene 
Carver kept wondering when Whit- 
cliffe would press the button that 
would trigger the bomb. He must 
have the radio-command transmitter 
on him somewhere. But Morgan 
thought of that; they stripped Whit- 
cliffe down to the skin and turned 
up no radio. 

“If you’ll only listen, Morg!” 
pleaded Carver. 

“I thought you were an agent. 
Carver! I thought you were helping 
us. Yet all you can do is whine that 
Whitcliffe is right! Man alive, d’you 
know what you’re saying?” 

“Yes!” shouted Carver desperate- 
ly. “Yes, I do.” 

“Kill them all!” screamed Durl- 
ston suddenly. He crouched and in 
his hand appeared an automatic 
weapon — a needle-gun that shatter- 
ed a man’s neural system at a touch. 
“I can’t live without the Shield! No 
one can! It wouldn’t be decent! 
They’re all mad! Mad!” 

I T^or a moment stasis held them, 
“That’s how the chronically un- 
derdeveloped will react,” observed 
Whitcliffe with an imperturbable 
show of his habitual calm. “But we 
know the country possesses only a 
relative few of such feeble mental- 
ity. We know we are right.” 



154 



IP 




Staring in shocked horror at 
Durlston, Carol had the quick in- 
sanely gigglish thought that Whit- 
cliffe would be right; but he’d be 
dead. Durlston showed the classical 
symptoms of final-stage fear. Very 
shortly he would be incapable of 
acting; but in that terror-laden in- 
terim he would shoot down all Whit- 
cliffe’s associates. 

Morgan shouted, hard: “Put the 
gun down, Durlston! If you kill 
them we won’t be able to stop the 
bomb!” 

The whole situation had been 
changed by Durlston. Everyone there 
danced like puppets pulled by the 
strings of one man’s psychotically 
uncontrollable fear. 

“The radio trigger!” shouted 
Wendy. “Push the button now!” 

Everyone stood poised, as though 
on tiptoe with sinews tensed and 
straining, ready for the wild leap 
that would carry them to safety. The 
stasis held; no one moved. 

Thickly Durlston spoke, the words 
dropping like curdled blood; “It’s a 
radio trigger! And they’re not going 
to have the chance to set it off! The 
Shield is there to protect me. Me T* 

The automatic weapon jerked as 
Durlston’s nerves twitched; one eye- 
lid fluttered like torn canvas round- 
ing the Horn. He could not control 
the spittle that dribbled from the 
corner of his lax mouth — but his 
forefinger tightened on the trigger. 
The narrow red creases disappeared 
from the knuckle. Blood flowed 
away. The whiteness of marbled 
death showed — 

Watching the horror that would 
break over them all, Carol could do 



nothing. She could think. She scarce- 
ly breathed. She stood graven like 
some long-forgotten statue rediscov- 
ered beneath the sifted sands of 
time. 

The gun spat death. 

And Robin Carver hurled his body 
forward, arms outstretched like the 
protecting reach of a primitive god, 
his face blank and gaunt and his 
eyes staring in concentration, his 
brain forcing his body on. 

Into that cone of death walked 
Carver. His brain still functioning 
in a dying body he commanded his 
shrinking flesh to move forward. But 
he did not walk into a deathly bar- 
rage of leaden bullets. He walked 
knowingly into a stream of nerve- 
shattering needles. And with all 
nerves gone and all motor-responses 
dead his body could not support that 
gigantic outpouring of mental will. 

Carver fell. 

As he fell Durlston laughed. 

Then Morgan had snatched the 
gun away and hurled it from him 
into outer darkness. 

N o more than half a hundred 
heartbeats had passed since 
Durlston drew his gun. 

The nightmare began then for 
Carol. 

From that moment when Robin 
Carver fell to the ground, his neural 
system sundered, she knew she 
would know only regret. Too late 
she realized what she had lost. She 
stumbled forward to fall on her 
knees beside the body and felt the 
presence beside her of Wendy Car- 
ver. No one moved to stop them as 
they mourned their dead. 



THE DOOMSDAY MEN

Detective on Watch Soames slip- 
ped Ac carmo sensing lobes on Car- 
ver’s temples personally. The hover- 
van had not been brought down 
here into the fallout shelter. Now 
Carol’s invention was to save the 
Shield and save humanity from it- 
self. He looked down on Carver’s 
face. 

“You always did get yourself in 
spots, Robin. You seemed to have 
a genius for it.” 

“Hurry it up!” shouted Morgan. 
*Tm as sorry as any of you that 
Robin bought it; but that’s life. I 
want to know where that radio trig- 
ger is!” He gestured to the guards. 
“Search everyone. And if you find 
it handle it like it’s the bomb itself.” 
At once a rapid bustle of efficient 
searching began with the soft whick- 
ering of the tape spools crooning a 
background. 

The searchers found no radio trig- 
ger. 

With that blaze of insane energy 
ejaculated in one fear-consuming in- 
stant, Alec Durlston regained his 
usual poise. He looked down on 
Carver’s body and shook his head. 

“I don’t know what came over 
me. I’m sorry.” He swung on Mor- 
gan with fierce vitality. “All I did 
was do your dirty work for you. 
You were going to shoot one of 
them for your information. I just did 
k for you. That's all.” 

“That’s all,” said Morgan. But he 
turned his back on Durlston and 
walked across to talk low-voiced to 
Soames. 

“You’re not an operator?” 

“No. But Durlston is. And now 
he has a vested interest in finding 



the answer. It’s his only out as far 
as I am concerned. Otherwise I’ll 
book him for murder.” 

Morgan had too much on his 
mind to argue. A bomb might go 
off at any moment, triggered in 
some devious way by this group of 
insane nihilists. He seemed as far 
away as ever from preventing it. 
Carol looked up from where she 
crouched on her knees beside Car- 
ver. Wendy could only kneel silently 
with her heavy helmet of hair 
swinging forward, shining, her wide, 
blank eyes riveted with horrified in- 
comprehension on her dead father’s 
face. 

“It’s all on tape now,” Carol said 
in a leaden voice. “As soon as Durls- 
ton has penetrated I’m going in. I 
owe Robin that. It’s all I have left.” 

W ith the attachment of the sens- 
ing lobes to Durlstons’ temples 
and the softly repetitious whirring 
of the tapes the fallout shelter be- 
came a place of ghosts. 

Both sides in this bitter conflict 
for a world could only wait chained 
in the coils of science, for what a 
machine could bring back from the 
memories of a dead man. 

Carol waited, wondering how 
Durlston had the nerve to penetrate 
a man he had just killed. She knew 
that thought to be redundant, savor- 
ing the irony of the situation in a 
pathetic and hopeless attempt to blot 
out her tearing feelings of anger and 
hatred and futility. 

“Durlston always was a little slow 
coming back,” Soames said as Cy 
Adams settled down watchfully be- 
side the still form of Durlston.

Adams nodded confirmation. 
“Robin always came back full of 
snap and awareness of self and 
where he was. But Durlston always 
hung back. Loggy.” 

Soames pressed the green finished 
button and Adams shook Durlston 
gently. Carol reached down, anxious 
to slip on the lobes and run the tape 
again; but then the look of Durlston 
arrested her. Fleetingly she remem- 
bered how Lines had looked after 
he’d come back. 

Durlston gasped, a puff of air es- 
caping from slack lips. His eyes 
flicked open, quivering lids moving 
spasmodically. Deep within those 
eyes a frightful gulf yawned, an 
emptiness, a blackness that startled 
Carol. The man’s face twitched. The 
mouth opened and closed like that 
of a new born baby. 

“You’re Alec Durlston,” Cy 
Adams began the drill. “Snap out of 
it. You’re back. Where were vou 
born?” 

Durlston only gargled. 



“Where were you born?” 

“Oast Old, Kenchley, Brent.” 

“No, no, man!” Adams bent clon- 
er, putting incisive bite into his re- 
call words. “You are Alec Durlstonl 
We have to know where the radio- 
trigger is hidden. You were born — ” 
Durlston’s voice strengthened. 
‘The Old Oast, Brenchley, Kent.” 
“What? That’s Robins! When?” 
“Twenty-sixth August, eighty- 
nine.” Durlston’s eyes opened wide 
and force and personality glared 
out. He gripped his fingers together, 
shuddered, and then flopped back. 

“Alec Durlston,” he said. “Yes. 
Yes, of course! I understand now.” 
“You always were sluggish, Durls- 
ton. You really do understand you 
are Alec Durlston and not Robin 
Carver? Good. Tell us, then, quickly 
— where is the radio trigger?”

D urlston moved stiffly and sat up. 
At once his eyes switched to the

wr 




corpse of Robin Carver and to 
Wendy still crouched over the body. 
He saw Carol moving away with the 
carmo fumbling the sensing lobes 
onto her temples. 

“It’s not — ” he said. And then: 
“My God! I don’t believe it!” And, 
finally: “But I must!” 

“Where, man? Where?” bellowed 
Morgan. 

“I missed — Carver missed it.” 
He stood up, swayed and then mov- 
ed creakingly towards Carver’s body. 
He moved like a man drugged, or a 
man not in full control of his limbs. 
He reached the body and swayed, 
then fell to his knees beside Wendy. 
‘They slipped it into his pocket, 
knowing he would be the one least 
likely for you to suspect, and dis- 
guised as a flicker he might easily 
own Here it is.” 

Durlston held up what appeared 
to be a straightforward cigarette 
lighter, one of the gas jobs still pre- 
ferred by people who didn’t care for 
the almost universal selfigs. 

Out of nowhere, he said: “They 
asked James McLellan Partridge for 
a light and he produced his flicker. 
He didn’t know he was going to be 
killed as he held it out. As you don’t 
know what has happened as I hold 
out this — flicker.” 

“What are you babbling about, 
man?” thundered Morgan. “Handle 
that thing gently! Give it here.” 

Alec Durlston extended the light- 
er. His thumb curved over the catch 
securing the top. He said: “Care for 
a light?” He pressed. 

I n the fallout shelter this close to 
ground zero they’d feel the shock 



waves through the ground first. They 
wouldn’t arrive for a moment or two 
yet. Everyone — Soames, Morgan, 
Wendy, Whitcliffe — everyone stared 
at Durlston. Some spoke; but nothing 
made sense now. 

Carol ripped off the sensing lobes 
and jumped up, her face alight with 
an enormous, wonderful knowledge. 

“The tapes are blank!” she 
screamed. “Don’t you understand? 
There’s nothing on the tape!” 

Whitcliffe chuckled harshly. 

“I always knew it could happen. 
That’s one reason we have such 
stringent return techniques. And you 
didn’t let us down, Carver! You 
didn’t feel when I put the trigger 
in your pocket; but you picked it 
up the second time around. Was it 
a struggle, taking over Alec Durls- 
ton?” 

“Taking over Durlston? What is 
this?” shouted Morgan, despite what 
was happening outside caught up in 
this sudden apparation born of 
scientific technology. 

“The bomb — ” said Soames. 

“I — don’t know how it happen- 
ed,” said Robin Carver from the 
body of Alec Durlston. “I experienc- 
ed shattering blackness when he fir- 
ed. I know I was damned determin- 
ed to close with him, to get him, to 
shut him up this time, but good. I 
suppose that violence of hate carried 
me through into his mind when he 
penetrated — ” 

“Hate, Robin?” said Carol. “Or 
love? Love for the whole human 
race?” 

“I’m not trying to pretend to 
what I’m not.” Carver touched Wen- 
dy gently on the shoulder, still trying 



158 



IF 




to accustom himself to the idea that 
every time he shaved he’d have to 
look at Alec Durlston’s face in the 
mirror. “As for love — I know I 
love my daughter Wendy. And I 
love you, Carol. You know that.” 

“I know it.” 

“I suppose,” Wendy said thought- 
fully as the first of the battering 
ground waves rocked in through the 
pre-stressed concrete, “I suppose I’ll 
just have to get used to having a 
handsome father. My father in 
whatever goddam body he likes — 
just so he’s still with me!” 

The fallout shelter shuddered to 
the concussions as a new world was 
born. 

M organ was trying to speak; try- 
ing to explain away to himself 
the rending of a lifetime’s work. 

Carver said: “We are going to 
build a new and better world. Morg. 
We’ve let in the fresh air and sun- 
light. And now we’ll be able to see 
our kinds grow up without being 



buried alive behind the Shield.** 

Outside now the mushroom grew 
and bloated towards the skies. 

“Your carmos won’t find much 
sale with the youngsters now, Car- 
ol,” said Whitcliffe. “They’re going 
to have too much to do building up 
a decent life for everyone to be able 
to fritter away in vicarious pleas- 
ures.” 

The mushroom bloated and rip- 
pled and convulsed. 

And the Shield had vanished. 

Charlie Rawlinson had the tv eye 
scanning now. They all stood to 
watch the mushroom on the screen, 
watching in awe and wonder. 

“Do you know what you’ve 
done?” whispered Morgan. 

“Yes, we know.” The feel of this 
new body was coming nicely to 
Carver now. He put an arm around 
Carol’s waist and the other around 
Wendy’s. They fitted beautifully. 

“We know. We’ve given our own 
people the chance to make a fresh 
start down the right road.” END 




THE DOOMSDAY MEN 








The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet . 



Dear Editor: 

I think that your story in Sep- 
tember If, entitled Under Two 
Moons , is a rather good tale of in- 
terplanetary skullduggery. How- 
ever, you did several things which 
I consider unpardonable. 

Let us look at them in the order 
of their magnitude. First, you 
allowed Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of 
Thark and the mightiest warrior of 
Barsoom, to be killed by a few in- 
terplanetary nasties in a flying 
saucer. Second, you made one of 
the greatest rulers of Edgar Rice 
Burroughs private world an oper- 
ator of a taxi service. Third, the 
dead sea bottoms are covered with 
a sward of ochre, moss-like vege- 
tation; the “canals’’ are more fer- 
tile regions where most of the Bar- 
soomian farms are. Also the only 
bodies of water to speak of are the 
Lost Sea of Korus in the Valley 
Dor, and the underground Sea of 
Omean. The thoat is slate-gray, not 
slate-green. 

If you must borrow The Great 
One’s characters and let them get 
rubbed out, the least you can do is 



leave his worlds alone! — Ivan 
Theon, 6850 Morelia Avenue, North 
Hollywood, California.

Dear Editor: 

Congratulations on the new Doc 
Smith epic! I am by way of being 
almost a Number One Doc Smith 
fan, a completist in collecting them, 
in fact, and this is surely not only 
the equal of the early Skylarks, he 
has gone on from those earlier days. 
Well worth my subscription to If, 
that alone. Not that I complain 
for a moment at your bringing back 
such typical Von Vogts as this 

most recent issue. 

Any possibility of getting a new 
story by Eric Frank Russell? Just 
an idea . I got no complaints, for 
sure ! — Clayton Hamlin, Southwest 
Harbor, Maine.

Dear Editor: 

If is probably the best sf maga- 
zine on the market today. In the 
past few years that I have been 
reading it I have noticed only a 

handful of mediocre stories. I have 

yet to find a novel contained in its 



160 



pages that I have disliked. Yet I 
have quite a few comments and 
questions. 

1. I am very interested in sf art- 
work. Gray Morrow is probably the 
best illustrator in the field. I would 
like to see more of his work, 
especially cover illustrations. Per- 
haps he and McKenna could alter- 
nate on covers, Morrow one month 
and McKenna the next. I am glad 
to see that you have acquired the 
services of Wallace Wood, but I 
am also disappointed. He can do 
much better work than that which 
appeared in the September issue. 
Ghmta has been improving every 
month. I would also like to see 
more by Jack Gaughan. 

2 . I would like to see If get the 
new Heinlein novel. 

8. Whatever happened to Theo- 
dore Sturgeon, who wrote your fea- 
tures until the May, 1964 issue? 

4. Are you, the editor, planning 
to write any sequel (s) to The Reefs 
•/ Space and Star child in collabor- 
ation with Jack Williamson? I hope 
so! 

5. Could you please announce the 
winners of awards at the 23d World 
Science Fiction Convention to be 
held in London in one of your three 
magazines? 

6. Could you tell me if Robert 
A. Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange 
Land won a Hugo? 

7. I think, as probably many 
other fans do, that it is time for 
science fiction to change its pub- 
lic image. Whenever people hear 
that I read sf they suddenly think 
of me as some kind of nut or eccen- 
tric. This is mainly due to bad 
movies and television shows (such 
as The Outer Limits). It is about 
time that sf became respectable. I 



would like to know what my fellow 
fans feel about this, and if they 
have any ideas on how it could be 
accomplished. — Stanley Krute, 30 
Barnesdale Road, Natick, Massa- 
chusetts. 

• 1. Watch for next month's Mor- 
row cover for the new Heinlein 
novel — it hasn't been engraved yet, 
but the painting is a beauty! But 
McKenna is out of service for a 
while; he's in England, taking part 
in the art preparation for Arthur 
C. Clarke's big new sf movie. 2. 
We've got it. 3. We've been asking 
Ted Sturgeon the same question. 
He's been busy with other projects 
— but we hope to lure him back to 
our pages ere long. 4. Yes, the last 
in the series — which the first two 
were planned to lead up to-- is al- 
ready complete in rough draft. 
Tentative title is Rogue Star . But 
when it will be finished and print- 
ed we cannot say. With a great 
lineup of serials already in the 
safe and carrying us well into next 
year — Heinlein's The Moon Is a 
Harsh Mistress, followed by Keith 
Laumer and Rosel G. Brown's 
Earthblood , followed by Algis Bud- 
rys' The Iron Thom — publication 
date for Rogue Star is, to say the 
least, uncertain! 5. Bob Bloch — 
who, as this is written, is winging 
his way over the Pole to London — 
promises us a full convention re- 
port, including award winners; 
we'll try to have it in next issue 
or the one following at the latest. 
6. Yes, it won a Hugo — making, 
let's see, four so far. (And maybe 
another in the works!) 7. The trou- 
ble with science fiction's public im- 
age is that a lot of people simply 
have lost the habit of exercising 
their brains and, since they can't

follow sf without at least a modi- 
cum of thought, prefer to assume 
there’s nothing there worth fol- 
lowing. Let them rot, say we — let's 
confine our interest to the thousands 
•f brilliant and able scientists, 
engineers, show-business luminar- 
ies, writers, statesmen, business- 
men and others of unquestioned 
food judgment who do understand 
It — who like it, and read it — and 
often enough write it, too! Out of 
personal experience we can testify 
that we have never found a “gla- 
mor” institution in this country — 
from Cape Kennedy to the halls of 
Congress, from the movie and TV 
•tudios to the greatest universities 
— which does not have a signifi- 
cantly higher proportion of science- 
fiction readers than the public at 
large. For the un-turned-on others 
— it's their loss, not ours. — Editor. 
* * * 

Dear Editor: 

At the first let me thank you 
for the many interesting and good 
science-fiction stories which are 
published by you. Most I like 
science-fiction stories from West- 
ern countries, and gladly I want 
to have Galaxy and If permanently. 
But I cannot send from East Ger- 
many money order to you for a 
subscription. So I'll ask you if 
you can give me an address of a 
fan who like to exchange with me 
these magazines. I'll give science- 
fiction books in German languages 
therefore. — Siegbert G. Gunzel, 
Schwedter Strasse 268, 1054 Berlin, 
East Germany. 

• Any takers? — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

Your September editorial does 
nothing to dispel a nice tidy cate- 



gorization I have of flying-saucer 
sightings. There seems to be much 
in common between saucer-hunt- 
ing and witch-hunting. Both rely 
on “an overwhelming quantity of 
reported observations” and both 
seem to have about the same de- 
gree of scientific acceptability. By 
all means discuss flying saucers, 
but in the same way as one dis- 
cusses astrology or witchcraft, 
without getting excited, forming 
“national socities” or even writ- 
ing patronizing letters with too 
many present participles. The advo- 
cation of the intensive propagation 
of dubious “scientific views” can do 
no good to the cause. I see a lynch 
mob! B. P. Townsend, 407 Col- 

lege Street, Burlington, Vermont 
• We weren't advocating. We were 
only reporting what we had seen 
and learned after a good many 
editor-hours of time — and heaven 
knows, we haven't been able to find 
any good reason for deciding either 
for or against the UFOlogists. Far 
as we're concerned, it's all still an 
open question. 

Incidentally, our editorial drew 
forth several letters reporting new 
“sightings”. One was particularly 
interesting — had to do with an ex- 
perience outside Las Vegas, in a 
borrowed pickup truck — but the 
v writer didn't sign his name. Would 
he care to let us know it, in confi- 
dence, so we can print his letter? 
(We'll withhold names on request, 
but we won't ever print a letter 
from someone who doesn't sign it.) 

And that about fills us up again. 
This month's “first” story is by 
W. I. McLaughlin. Next month we 
start the new Heinlein — strongly 
recommended! See you then .

Forgotten road to success in writing 



By J. D. Ratcliff 

I can’t imagine why more beginners don’t 
take the short road to publication — by 
writing magazine and newspaper articles. 

I’ve made a good living for 25 years 
writing articles, and I’ve enjoyed every 
minute of it. I’ve interviewed Nobel Prize 
winners and heads of state. I’ve covered 
stories from Basel to Bangkok to Buffalo. 

It’s a great life. No commuter trains to 
catch, no office routine. Whether I’m at 
home or abroad on assignment, I write 
from eight to noon every day — no more, 
no less. My afternoons are my own. 

The market for articles is vast and hun- 
gry. Over 350,000 were sold last year to 
magazines alone. Editors want pieces on 
almost any subject that comes natural to 
you — but they demand that your writing 
be sound and professional. 

To teach professional writing techniques 
to serious beginners, I joined with Rod 
Serling, Faith Baldwin, Bennett Cerf, and 
eight other leading authors to start the 
Famous Writers School. 

We poured everything we know about 
successful writing into a new kind of 
course which trains you at home, in spare 
time. You begin with the fundamentals of 
all good writing. Then, you specialize in 
articles and other non-fiction. (Or in Fic- 
tion, Advertising or Business Writing.) 

You learn to write by writing. Our in- 
structors, themselves all published au- 
thors, work with you by mail much as 
editors do with established writers. 

Our School is young. Yet students, many 
still in training, have broken into print in 
more than 60 publications. Several sold 
pieces they wrote as School assignments. 



Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you too can be a published 
writer, send for the School’s revealing Apti- 
tude Test. If you test well — or offer other 
evidence of writing ability — you may enroll. 
However, there is no obligation to do so. 




“Jack” Ratcliff is one of America’s highest paid 
free-lance writers. Although he works only 
four hours a day, he has had hundreds of articles 
published in top magazines, including oyer 
100 in Reader's Digest alone.
