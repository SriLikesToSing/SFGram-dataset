EDITOR’S PAGE 

Sirius, the Dog Star, this morn- 
ing rose with the Earth’s sun and I 
am rolling at eighty mph, one 
hand on the wheel, the other hold- 
ing the mike and this is what I am 
saying. This morning marks an 
emergence. Not a rebirth; none of 
us is given that kind of second 
chance. Today does not pause for 
rebirths. It simply changes. Sirius 
tonight will set with the sun —but 
on an Earth slightly altered. I am 
on my way to tell Baby Machine 
that it is not yet ready for the 
Worlds of IF. Alternatives must 
take over. 

Baby Machine stands about sev- 
en feet tall, is all head and gaping 
stomach, and men live by it. It 
controls other machines men once 
operated and the men who under- 
stood those are gone. The men left 
are survivors of an era when ma- 
chines did not think and they 
stand around, apprehensively eye- 
ing the door through which their 
predecessors— the men who could 
think — passed and never returned. 

The survivors speak softly. 

Don\t get too close to the door. 

Don't think. 

Baby Machine does all the 
thinking for the giant, leftover, 
mechanical typesetting dinosaurs 
of an earlier time who no longer 
respond to the men who do not 
understand them but who depend 
on them for a livelihood. Baby 
Machine, a computer, issues their 
orders and when Baby speaks the 
ancient, intricate monsters thun- 
der to ghostly life, spewing out 
words. They emerge enormously 



mangled, elongated, mutilated, 
inane, for Baby Machine — being 
a Baby, you understand — has no 
memory banks. It has only a brain 
and a Program. 

It does its best for the men who 
live by it. But its best is not good 
enough for men who are not 
afraid of the door. 

The New England mountains 
and the road ahead are flooded 
with sunlight and alternatives and 
I am on a Serius errand, if you will 
forgive the pun. Baby is a Holy 
Yoke to the helpless humans who 
live by it — and the Words of IF 
are clamoring for release. And IF 
is the magazine of Alternatives 
that lie beyond the door Baby Ma- 
chine’s people are afraid to ap- 
proach. Too much responsibility, 
see? 

I reach the door and use it to 
enter. I speak to the men who de- 
pend on Baby. I ask them for the 
Words of IF. Communication is 
difficult. The sun and Sirius are 
setting by the time Baby lifts the 
Yoke. 

I use the door to go out. With 
me are these Words of IF. 

In our tomorrows — yours and 
mine — is an Adult Machine that 
remembers, that speaks to its me- 
chanical contemporaries and to 
humans who understand it and 
who are not afraid of the door. To 
put it plainly, you and Galaxy, 
Worlds of IF, Worlds of Tomor- 
rows and Fantasy are changing to 
a modern printer with this issue of 
the magazine of Alternatives. 

Much remains to be done. But 
how do you like the emergent new 
look?

Infinitely wise and endlessly 
good, the machine created a world 
so sane that it could only go madi 



I T WAS hot in Palos that time of 
year. The Being Machine had 
reduced many of its activities and 
sped up its cooling system. 

This season is called hot and 
desolate, the Machine recorded. 
People must be entertained in 
such a season , . 

Shortly after noon it noted that

not many people were in the 
streets except for a few tourists 
who carried, slung around their 
necks, full-sense recorders. The 
tourists perspired heavily. 

Some loc^ residents, those not 
busy with the labors of survival, 
peered occasionally from behind 
insulated windows or stood shaded 
in the screen fields of their door- 
ways. They seemed to float in 
muddy seclusion beneath the 
lemonade sky 

The nature of the season and 
the environment crept through the 
Machine. It began sending out the 
flow of symbols which guarded 
the gateway to imagination and 
consciousness. The symbols were 
many and they flowed outward 
like silver rivers, carrying ideas 
from one time-place to another 
across a long span of existence. 

Presently, as the sun slipped 
halfway toward the moment when 
it would levy darkness, the Being 
Machine began to build a tower. 
It called the tower palace of 
PALOS CULTURE. And the name 
stretched across the tower’s lower 
stories in glowing letters taller 
than a man. 

At an insulated window across 
the plaza a man called Wheat 
watched the tower go up. He could 
hear the shuttle moving in his 
wife’s loom and he felt torn by 
shameful reluctance, unwilling to 
watch the thought spasms in his 
mind. He watched the tower in- 
stead, 



“The damn thing’s at it again,” 
he said. 

“It’s that time of year,” his wife 
agreed, not looking up from the 
design she was weaving. The de- 
sign looked like a cage of yellow 
spikes within a wreath of cas- 
cading orange roses. 

Wheat thought for a few min- 
utes about the subterranean vast- 
ness men had measured out, de- 
fining the limits of the Being Ma- 
chine. There must be caverns 
down there. Wheat thought. End- 
lessly nocturnal spiral corridors 
where no rain ever fell. Wheat 
liked to imagine the Being Ma- 
chine this way, although there 
existed no record of any man’s 
having entered the ventilators or 
surface extrusions by which "the 
Machine made itself known. 

“If that damn machine weren’t 
so disgusting — it’d be funny,” 
Wheat said. 

“I’m much more interested in 
problem solving,” his wife said. 
“That’s why I took up design. Do 
you suppose anyone will try to 
stop it this time?” 

“First, we’d have to figure out 
what it is,” Wheat said. “And the 
only records which could show us 
that are inside there.” 

“What’s it doing?” his wife 
asked. 

“Building something. Calls it a 
palace but it’s going up pretty 
high. Must be twenty stories al- 
ready.” 

His wife paused to readjust

the harness of her loom. She could 
see the way this conversation was 
going and it dismayed her. The 
slanting sun cast Wheat’s shadow 
into the room and the black shape 
of it stretched out there on the 
floor made her want to run away. 
At times such as these she hated 
the Machine for pairing her with 
Wheat. 

“I keep wondering what it’ll 
take away from us this time,” she 
said. 

W HEAT continued to stare 
through the window, awed 
by the speed with which the tower 
was rising. The rays of the setting 
sun painted streaks of orange on 
the tower surface. 

He was the standard human 
male, this Wheat, but old. He had 
a face like a vein-leaf cabbage, 
wrinkles overlapping wrinkles. He 
stood about two meters tall, as 
did all the other adults of the 
world, and his skin was that uni- 
versal olive-tan, his hair dark and 
eyes to match. His wife, although 
bent from years at the loom, 
looked remarkably like him. Both 
wore their hair long, tied at the 
neck with strips of blue flash- 
cloth. Sacklike garments of the 
same material covered their bodies 
from neck to ankles. 

“It’s frustrating,” Wheat said. 
For a while the Being Machine 
conducted an internal thought- 
play in the language of the Kersan- 
Pueblo, exploring the subtle mor- 

THE MIND BOMB 



phemes which recorded all actions 
now being undertaken as merely 
hearsay. 

Culture, the Machine recorded, 
speaking only for its internal sen- 
sors but using several vocalizers 
and varied tonal modes. Culture 
— culture — culture — The word 
fed on thought-nourishment and 
ignited a new train of concepts. 
A new Law of Culture must be 
homogenized immediately. It will 
be codified with the usual enforce- 
ments and will require precise ef- 
forts of exactness in its expres- 
sion, , , 

Wheat’s window looked south 
past the district of the Machine 
and across an olive orchard that 
ran right up to a cliff above the 
sea. The sky was heavy above 
the sea and ^owed with old sun- 
set colors. 

“There’s a new law,” Wheat 
said. 

“How do you know?” his wife 
asked. 

“I know. I just know.” 

His wife felt like crying. The 
same old pattern. Always the 
same. 

“The new law says I must jug- 
gle many ideas simultaneously in 
my mind,” Wheat said. “I must 
develop my talents. I must con- 
tribute to human culture.” 

His wife looked up from her 
weaving, sighed. “I don’t know 
how you do it,” she said. “You’re 
drunk.” 

“But there’s a law that — ” 



7 




“There’s no such law!” She 
took a moment to calm herself. 
“Go to bed, you old fool. I’ll sum- 
mon a medic with a potion to 
restore your senses.” 

“There was a time,” Wheat 
said, “when you didn’t think of 
medics when you thought of bed.” 

He stepped back from the win- 
dow, stared at the cracked wall 
behind his wife’s loom, then 
looked out at the sun-yellowed 
olive orchard and the blue-green 
sea. He thought the sea was ugly 
but the crack on the wall suggested 
a beautiful design for his wife to 
weave on her loom. He formed 
the pattern of the design in his 
mind — golden scales on cas- 
cades of black. 

Mirror memories of his own 
wrinkled face superceded the pat- 
tern in his mind. That was always 
the way when he tried to think 
freely. Ideas became fixed in 
ebony cement. 

“I will make a golden mask,” 
he said. “It will be etched with 
black veins and it will make me 
beautiful.” 

“There’s no more gold in the 
entire ' world, you old fool.” His 
wife sneered. “Gold’s only a word 
in books. What did you drink last 
night?” 

“I had a letter in my pocket 
from Central Solidarity,” he said, 
“but someone stole it. I com- 
plained to the Machine but it 
wouldn’t believe me. It made me 
stop and sit down by a scaly post. 



down by the water there, and re- 
peat after it ten million times — ” 

“I don’t know what it is you 
use to make you drunk,” she com- 
plained, “but I wish you’d leave 
it alone. Life would be much 
simpler.” 

“I sat under a balcony,” the 
man said. 

The Being Machine listened for 
a time to the clacking of the hu- 
man-operated typers in the offices 
of Central Solidarity. As usual it 
translated the tiny differences of 
key touch into their corresponding 
symbols. The messages were quite 
ordinary. One asked the coopera- 
tion of a neighboring Centrality 
in the relocation of a cemetery, 
a move required because the Ma- 
chine had extruded a new ventila- 
tor into the area. Another ordered 
forty containers of watermelons 
from Regional Provender. Still 
another, for distribution to all 
Centralities, complained that tour- 
ists were becoming too numerous 
in Palos and were disturbing the 
local tranquility. 

The Palace of Palos Culture 
will be programmed for a small 
increase in discontent, the Ma- 
chine ordered. 

This accorded with the Law of 
the Great Cultural Discovery. Dis- 
content brought readiness for ad- 
venture, made men live near the 
heights of their powers. They 
would not live dangerously but 
their lives would have the appear- 
ance of danger. 



8 



IF 




Bureaucracy will end, the Ma- 
chine directed, and the typers will 
jail silent . 

These concepts, part of the 
Machine’s Prime Law, had sub- 
mitted to comparative repetition 
innumerable times. Now the Ma- 
chine recorded that (me of Cen- 
tral Solidarity’s typers in Palos 
was writing a love letter on offi- 
cial stationery, on duty time — 
and that a dignitary at Central 
Provender in the Centrality of 
Asius had sequestered a basket of 
fresh apples for his own use. 
These items fitted the interpreta- 
tion of “good signs.” 

“It’s an artificial intelligence of 
some kind,” Wheat’s wife said. 
She had left her loom to stand 
beside Wheat and watch the tow- 
er grow. “We know that much. 
Everybody says it.” 

“But how does it think?” 
Wheat asked. “Does it have linear 
thoughts? Does it think 1 -2-3-4 — 
a-b-c-d? Is it some (xld clock 
ticking away under the earth?” 
“It could be a marble rattling 
around in a box,” his wife said. 
“What?” 

“You know — open the box at 
different times and you might find 
the marble almost anywhere inside 
the box.” 

“But who made the marble rat- 
tle into our world?” Wheat asked. 
“That’s the question. Who told it, 
‘Make us one of those!’?” 

He pointed to the tower which 
now st(xx] more than one hundred 



stories above the plaza. It was a 
structure of glistening orange in 
the evening light, ribbed vertically 
with deep black lines, windowless, 
terrifying and absurd. Wheat felt 
that the tower accused him of 
some profound sin. 

“Perhaps it incorporates its own 
end,” his wife suggested. 

A^eat shook his head, not deny- 
ing what she had said, but wish- 
ing for silence in which to think. 
Sharply glittering metallic devices 
could be glimpsed at the top of 
the tower where it continued to 
rise. How high was it going? Al- 
ready, the tower must be the 
highest artifi(nal structure men had 
ever seen. 



A SMALL band of tourists 
paused in the plaza to record 
the tower. They <iid not appear 
excited by it, merely (nirious in a 
polite way. Here was a thing to 
carry home and replay for friends. 

It built a tower one day while 
we were there. Notice the sign: 
PALACE OF PALOS CULTURE. Isn’t 
that amusing? 

After reviewing the matter to 
the extent of its data, the Being 
Machine found no path open for 
intrcxlucing culture into human 
society. It made the final com- 
paratives in Kersan-Pueblo re-, 
cording that the described ac- 
tion must be internal, experienced 
only by the speaker. Humans 
could not acquire the <mlture fa- 



THE MIND BOMB

cility from the outside or by hear- 
say. 

The need for new decisions dic- 
tated that the tower had risen 
high enough. The Being Machine 
capped its construction with a 
golden pyramid three hundred 
cubits on a side, measuring by the 
Judean cubit. The dimensions 
were compared and recorded. 
The tower was not the tallest in 
history but greater than the new- 
men had ever seen. Its effect 
would be interesting to observe, 
according to the interest-factor 
equations with which the Machine 
was equipped. 

At the apex of the pyramid the 
Machine installed a sensor excita- 
tion device, a simple system of 
plasma optics. It was designed to 
write with a flaming torch on the 
interface between stratosphere and 
troposphere. 

The Being Machine, occupied 
with selecting a new label for the 
tower, with analyzing the dreams 
in all the humans sleeping at that 
moment, and with constructing 
the historic analogies by which it 
amused its charges, wrote selected 
thou^ts on the sky. 

The books of Daniel and Gen- 
esis are as good as anything of 
Freud on dream analysis , . 

The words blazed across fifty 
kilometers of the heavens, danc- 
ing and flaring at their edges. 
Much later they were the direct 
source of a new religion pro- 
claimed by a psychotic in a village 



at the edge of the phenomenon. 

The value of adversity is to 
make gardens out of wastelands, 
the Machine wrote. A thing may 
be thought of only as related to 
certain conditions , . 

Analyzing the dreams, the Ma- 
chine employed the concepts of 
libido, psychic energy and 
human experience of death. Death, 
according to the Machine’s com- 
paratives, meant the end of libido 
energy, a non-scientific idea be- 
cause it postulated a destruction 
of deduct energy, defying several 
established laws in the process. 
Any other comparison required be- 
lief in the soul and god(s). The 
considerations were not assisted 
by postulating a temporary libido. 

There must be a false idea sys^ 
tern here, The Being Machine 
rec<M*ded. 

Somehow the symbol screen 
through which it sifted reality had 
gone out of phase with the uni- 
verse. It searched through its lan- 
guages and comparison systems 
for new grooves in which to func- 
tion. No closer symbol approach 
to phenomena revealed itself. 
Lack of proper validity forms 
inhibited numerous channels 
through which it regulated human 
affairs. Thought ignitions went out 
from the Machine incompletely 
formed. 

W HAT we need is a new com- 
munications center;” Wheat 

said. 



10 



IF 




He stood at his window, look- 
ing out past the tower to where 
the sun was settling toward the 
sea horizon. The sea had become 
beautiful in his eyes and the 
cracked walls of his home were 
ugly. His wife, old and bent- 
backed, was ugly, too. She had 
lit a lamp for her work and she 
made ugly movements at her loom. 
Wheat felt emotion going to his 
head like a white storm. 

“There are too many gaps in 
our knowledge of the universe,” 
he said. 

“You’re babblins:, old man,” 
his wife said. “I wish you would 
not go out and get yourself drunk 
every night.” 

“I find myself cast in a curious 
role,” Wheat said, ignoring her 
ugly comment. “I must show men 
to themselves. We men of Palos 
have never understood ourselves. 
And if we here at the heart of 
the Machine cannot understand 
ourselves, no human can.” 

“Don’t come around begging 
me for money tonight,” his wife 
said. 

“I’ll ask Central Solidarity for 
an appropriation,” Wheat said. 
“Twenty million ought to do for 
a start. We’ll begin by building 
an Institute of Palos Communica- 
tion. Later, we can open branches 
in — ” 

“The Machine won’t let you 
build anything, old fool!” 

The Being Machine decided to 
open its tower immediately, call- 

THE MIND BOMB 



ing it, Institute of Palos CommunU 
cation. The directives went out 
for the tower to begin its func- 
tions slowly, not putting undue 
strain on the emotions and in- 
tellect of the audience. Pressure 
would be increased only when 
people began asking questions 
about the authority of god(s) and 
about the grounds of moral and 
spiritual life. The trouble over 
validity forms made the task dif- 
ficult. But all guiding of humans 
must begin with the people of 
Palos. 

With its plasma optics sys- 
tem the Machine wrote on the 
sky. 

Refined communication re- 
quires a carefully constructed con- 
science, allowing people to disobey 
the laws of god{s) only by pay- 
ment of certain suffering and 
pangs. People must know what 
is required of them before they 
disobey. 

The message was so long that 
the blazing light of it outshone 
the setting sun, filling Palos with 
an orange glow. 

The Being Machine compared 
its present actions with the Prime 
Law, noting the prediction that 
one day humans would stop run- 
ning from the enemies within and 
would see themselves as they 
really were — beaytiful and tall, 
giants in the universe, capable of 
holding the stars in the palms of 
their hands. 

“I’ve spent my whole life watch- 

II 




ing that machine and I still don’t 
know what its specialty is,” Wheat 
said. “Think of what that damn 
thing has taken away from us in 
all the — ” 

“It was put here to punish us,” 
his wife said. 

“That’s nonsense.” 

“Somebody built it for a pur- 
pose, though.” 

“How do we know that? Why 
couldn’t it be purposeless?” 

“It’s killed people, you know,” 
she said. “There has to be some 
purpose in killing people.” 

“Maybe it’s just meant to cor- 
rect us, not punish,” he said. 

“You know you don’t kill peo- 
ple to correct them.” 

“But we haven’t done any- 
thing.” 

“You don’t know that.” 

“What you’re suggesting 
wouldn’t be reasonable or just.” 
“Hah!” 

“Lxx)k,” Wheat said pointing 
across the plaza. 

The Machine had changed the 
glowing label on its lower level. 
Now, the glittering letters spelled 

out: INSTITUThOF PAl.OSCOMMUNI- 
CATION. 

“What’s it doing now?” Wheat’s 
wife asked. 

He told her about the new 
sign. 

“It listens,” she said. “It listens 
to everything we do. It’s playing 
a joke on you now. It does that 
sort of thing, you know.” 

Wheat shook his head from side 



to side. The Machine was writing 
half-size letters below the new 
sign. It was a simple message. 

Twenty thousand cubicles — 
no waiting , . 

“It’s a mind bomb,” Wheat 
muttered. He spoke mechanically, 
as though the words were being 
fed into his vocal system from 
some remote place. “Its meant to 
break up the stratification of our 
society.” 

“What stratification?” his wife 
demanded. 

“Rich will speak to poor and 
poor to rich,” he said. 

“What rich?” she asked. “What 
poor?” 

“It’s an envelope of communi- 
cation,” he said. “It’s total sen- 
sory stimulation. I must hurry to 
Central Solidarity and tell them.” 

“You stay right where, you are,” 
his wife ordered, fear in her voice. 

She thought of what they’d say 
at Central Solidarity. 

Another one gone mad. 

Madness happened to people 
who lived so close to the Ma- 
chine’s heart. She knew what the 
tourists said, speaking of the Palos 
idiosyncrasies. 

Most of the people of Palos are 
slightly mad. One can hardly 
blame them. 

It was almost dark now, and 
the Machine wrote bright letters 
in the sky. 

You give the credit to Galileo 
that rightly belongs to Aristarchus 
of Samos. 



12 



IF 




“Who the devil’s Galileo?” 
Wheat asked, staring upward. 

His wife had crossed the room 
to stand between Wheat and the 
door. She started past him at the 
Hazing words. 

“Pay no attention to it,” she 
said. “That danm machine seldom 
makes any sense.” 

“It’s going to take something 
else away from us,” Wheat said. 
“I can feel it.” 

“What’s left to take?” she 
asked. “It took the gold, most 
of our books. It took away our 
privacy. It took away our right 
to choose our own mates. It took 
our industry and left us nothing 
but things like that.” 

She pointed to the loom. 

“There’s no sense attacking it,” 
he said. “We know it’s impregna- 
able.” 

“Now you’re sounding sensi- 
ble,” his wife said. 

“But has anyone ever tried 
talking to it?” Wheat asked. 

“Don’t be a fool. Where are 
it’s ears?” 

“It must have ears if it spies 
<m us.” 

“But where are they?” 

‘Twenty thousand cubicles, no 
waiting,” Wheat said.

aside, strode out into the 
night. He felt that his mind was 
sweeping away debris, flinging 
him down a passage through the

SEPTEMBER, and the mad. wild 
beauty of the St. LouisCorv is over 
(but won't be actually by the 
time you read this). Never mind. 
Traditionally, in publishing. Sep- 
tember is a good reading month. 
Summer doldrums are over, the 
kids are back in school, everyone 
is thinking in a serious-minded 
way about the long. hard, in- 
tellectual winter ahead. So Sep- 
tember is a big. big publishing 
month. 






WE are celebrating it with 
George MacDonald's very kooky 
Kafkaesque fantasy LILITH. What 
is almost as extraordinary as the 
novel itself is the idea that 
anything as modern as this was 
written back in the I890's by a 
Scottish (sometime) minister of 
advanced years. You'll recognize 
it by the superb Gervasio cover 
of a man in an attic.

AND in September, s.f.'s maior 
novel of the year — STAND ON 
ZANZIBAR, by John Brunner. Not 
an easy book to read (clearly a 
bit beyond those mainstream re- 
viewers). This is a jagged, frac- 
tionated, panoramic view of over- 
populated times to come — ^the 
style itself expressive of the ex- 
plosive tensions generated by too 
goddamned many people. The 
theme is well known to all of us. 
The handling is very special in-

THIS month a|so — O happy 
month — Larry Niven's volume of 
short stories which we titled THE 
SHAPE OF SPACE. Because it 
occurred to us that of all the new 
young writers, Larry's worlds are 
probably the most ingeniously 
specific. The shape of his par- 
ticular space is very definite, very 
much his own. Thank whatever 
gods there may be that he is also 
a very good writer, so we can 
all enjoy! 

• 

SEPTEMBER is TOLKIEN month 
too— a promotion yet — although 
he is our candidate for the author 
than whom no one needs promo- 
tion less; and a peculiar wisp of a 
book titled THE BEGAHING OF 
A PRESIDENT. It's very in to be 
anti-Nixon. Not that we're terri- 
bly concerned about being in. 
(We're rational, that's all). 

• 

FOR those whoVe been pleading, 
Burgess' A CLOCKWORK 
ORANGE is again available (now 
it comes at .95 though), plus a 
couple of non-fiction works per- 
tinent to Brunner's theme — THE 
FRAIL OCEAN by Wesfey Marx 
and MOMENT IN THE SUN by 
Leona and Robert Rienow.

night. His thoughts were summer 
lightning. He did not even see 
his neighbors and the tourists 
forced to jump aside as he rushed 
toward the tower, nor did he hear 
his wife crying in their doorway. 

The flame with which the Ma- 
chine wrote on the sky stood mo- 
tionless, a rounded finger of 
brightness poised above Palos. 

The Being Machine recorded 
Wheat’s approach, provided a 
door for him to enter. Wheat was 
the first human inside the Ma- 
chine’s protective field for thou- 
sands of centuries and the effect 
could only be described by saying 
it was as though an extern^ dream 
had become internal. Although 
the Machine did not have dreams 
in the literal sense, possessing only 
the reflected dreams of its charges. 

Wheat found himself in the cen- 
ter of a small room. It appeared 
to be the inside of a cube about 
three meters on a side. Walls, 
floors and ceiling were aglow. 

For the first time since rushing 
out of his home Wheat felt fear. 
There had been a door for him 
to enter but now there was no 
door. All of his many years settled 
on Wheat, leaving his mind 
threadbare. 

Presently a flowing blue script 
wrote words on the wall directly 
in frcMit of Wheat. 

Change is desirable. Senses are 
instruments for reacting to change. 
Without change the senses 
atrophy. 



IF 




Wheat recovered some of his 
courage. 

“What are you. Machine?” he 
asked. “Why were you built? 
What is your purpose?” 

There no longer care any clearly 
definable ethnic groups in your 
world - . 

The flowing script reappeared. 

“What are ethnic groups?” 
Wheat asked. “Are you an enter- 
tainment device?” 

Words flamed on the wall. 

Confucius, Leonardo da Vinci, 
Richard III, Einstein, Buddha, 
Jesus, Genghis Khan, Julius Cae- 
sar, Richard Nixon, Parker Voor- 
hees, Utsana Biloo and Ym Dufy 
all shared common ancestry, . 

“I don’t understand you,” 
Wheat complained. “Who are 
these people?” 

Freud was agoraphobic, Puri- 
tans robbed the Indians, Henry 
Tudor was the actual murderer 
of the Princes in the Tower, 
Moses wrote the Ten Command- 
ments. 

“That sign outside says this is 
an Institute of Communication,” 
Wheat said. “Why don’t you com- 
municate?” 

This is an exchange of mental 
events. 

“This is nonsense,” Wheat 
snapped. 

His fear was retuminc. There 
was no door. How could he leave 
this place? 

The Machine continued to in- 
form him. 



Any close alliance between su- 
perior and inferior beings must 
result in mutual hatred. This is 
often interpreted as repaying 
friendship with treachery. , 

“Where’s the door?” Wheat 
asked. “How do I get out of 
here?” 

Do you truly believe the sun is 
a ball of red-hot copper? 

“That’s a stupid question,” 
Wheat accused. 

Mental events must consist of 
certain sets of physical events. 

Wheat felt a venomous spurt 
of anger. The Machine was inak- 
ing fun of him. If it were only 
another human and vulnerable. 
He shook his head. Vulnerable to 
what? He felt that something had 
dyed his thoughts inwardly and 
that he had just glimpsed the col- 
or. 

“Do you have sensations and 
feelings?” Wheat asked. “Are you 
an intelligent being? Are you alive 
and conscious?” 

People often do not understand 
the difference between neuron im- 
pulses and states of conscious- 
ness. Most humans occupy low 
level impulse dimensions without 
realizing what they lack or sus- 
pecting their own potential. 

Wheat thought he detected a 
recognizable connection between 
his questions and the answer, won- 
dered if this could be illusion. 
He recalled the sound of his own 
voice in this room. It was like a 
wind hunting for something that 

15 



THE MIND BOMB 




could not be found in such an 
enclosed place. 

“Are you supposed to bring us 
up to our potential?” Wheat asked. 

What religious admonitions do 
you heed? 

Wheat sighed. Just when he 
thought the Machine was making 
sense it went nattering off. 

Do you sneer at ideas of con- 
science or ethical morality? Do 
you believe religion is an arti- 
ficial construction of little use to 
beings capable of rational anal- 
ysis? 

The damn thing was insane. 

“You’re an artifact of some 
kind” Wheat accused. “Why were 
you built? What were you sup- 
posed to do?” 

Insanity is the loss of true self- 
memory. The insane have lost 
their locus of accumulation. 

“You’re crazy!” Wheat blared. 
“You’re a crazy machine!” 

On the other hand, to over- 
come the theory of self-as-a-sym- 
bol is to defeat death. 

“I want out of here,” Wheat 
said. “Let me out of here.” 

He drew in a deep, chattering 
breath. There was a cold smell 
of oil in the room. 

If the universe were completely 
homogeneous you would be un- 
able to separate one thing from 
another. There would be no en- 
ergy, no thoughts, no symbols, no 
distinction between the individuals 
of any order. Sameness can go 
too far . 



“What are you?” Wheat 
screwed. 

The Prime Law conceives this 
Being as a thought-envelope. To 
be implies existence but the terms 
of a symbol system cannot express 
the real facts of existence. Words 
remain fixed and unmoving while 
everything external continues to 
change. 

Wheat shook his head from 
side to side. He felt his entrap- 
ment here as an acute helpless- 
ness. He had no tools with which 
to attack these glowing walls. It 
was cold, too. How cold it was! 
His mind was filled with desola- 
tion. He heard no natural sounds 
except his own breathing and the 
pounding of his heart. 

A thought-envelope? 

T his Machine had taken away 
all the world’s gold one day, 
so it was said. Another day it had 
denied people the use of combus- 
tion engines. It restricted the free 
movement of families but per- 
mitted the wanderings of tourist 
hordes. Marriage was Machine- 
guided and Machine-limited. Some 
said it limited conception. The 
few old books remaining held 
references to things and actions 
no longer understood — surely 
things the Machine had taken 
away. 

“I order you to let me out of 
here,” Wheat said. 

No words appeared. 

“Let me out, damn you!”

IF 




The Being Machine remained 
uncommunicative, occupied with 
its TICR function, Thinking Ideat; 
ing Coordinating Relating. 1 1 
was a function far removed from 
human thought. The nerve im- 
pulses of an insect were closer 
to human thought than were the 
functionings of TICR. 

Every interpretation and every 
system becomes false in the light 
of a more complete coordination, 
and the Machine TICRed within 
a core of relative truth, seeking 
discreet rational foundations and 
dimensional networks to approxi- 
mate the impulses commonly call- 
ed Everyday Experience. 

Wheat, the Machine observed, 
was kicking a wall of his cubicle 
and screaming in a hysterical 
fashion. 

Shifting to Time-and-Matter 
mode, the Machine reduced Wheat 
to a series of atomic elements, 
examined his individual existence 
in these energy expressions. Pres- 
ently, it reconstituted him as a 
flowing sequence of moments in- 
tegrated with the Machine’s own 
impulse systems. 

All the eternal laws of the past 
that have been proved temporary 
inspire caution in a reflexive 
thinker, Machine - plus - Wheat 
thought. What we have been pro- 
duces what we seem to be. 

This thought carried positive 
aspects in which Machine-plus- 
Wheat saw profound contradic- 
tions. This mode of mentation, 
THE MfND BOMB 



the Machine observed, held a de- 
ceptive clarity. Sharp limitation 
gave the illusion erf darity. It was 
like watching a shadow play which 
attempted to explcMre the dimen- 
sions of a real human life. The 
emotions were lost. Human ges- 
tures were reduced to caricature. 
All was lost but the illusion. The 
observer, charmed into belief that 
life had been clarified, forgot what 
was taken away. 

For the first time in the many 
centuries of its existence, the Be- 
ing Machine experienced an mo- 
tion. 

It felt lonely. 

Wheat remained within the Ma- 
chine, one relative system imping- 
ing upon another, sharing the 
emotion. When he reflected upon 
this experience, he thought he was 
moving in false imagination. He 
saw everything external as a wrong 
interpretation of inner experience. 
He and the Machine occupied a 
duality of existence/ non- 
existence. 

Grasping this twofold reflec- 
tion, the Machine restored Wheat 
to fleshly form, changing the form 
somewhat according to its own en- 
gineering principles, but leaving 
his external appearance more or 
less as it had been. 

W HEAT found himself stagger- 
ing down a long passage- 
way. He felt that he had lived 
many lifetimes. A strange clock 
had been set ticking within him. 



17 




It went chirrup and a day was 
gone. Chirrup again and a cen- 
tury had passed. Wheat’s stomach 
ached. He reeled his way from 
wall to wall down the long passage 
and emerged into a plaza filled 
with sunlight. 

Had the night passed? He won- 
dered. Or had it been century of 
nights? 

He felt that if he spoke, some- 
one — or (something) — would 
contradict him. 

A few early tourists moved 
around the plaza. They stared up- 
ward at something behind Wheat, 

The tower . 

The thought was odd in that 
it conceived of the tower as part 
of himself. 

Wheat wondered why the tour- 
ists did not question him. They 
must have seen him emerge. He 
had been in the Machine. He had 
been recreated and ejected from 
that enclosed circle of existence. 

He had been the Machine. 

Why didn’t they ask him what 
the Machine was? He tried to 
frame the answer he would give 
them but found words elusive. 
Sadness crept throught Wheat. He 
felt he had fled something that 
might have made him sublimely 
happy. 

A heavy sigh escaped him. 

Remembering the duality of 
existence he had shared with the 
Machine, Wheat recognized anoth- 
er aspect of his own being. He 
could feel the Machine’s suppres- 



sion of his thoughts — the sharp 
editing, the closed-off avenues, the 
symbol urgings, the motives not 
his own. From the ground of the 
Machine, he could sense where 
he was being trimmed. 

Wheat’s chest pained him when 
he breathed. 

The Being Machine, occupied 
with its newly amplified TICR 
function, asked itself a question. 
What judgment could I pass upon 
them worse than the judgment 
they pass upon themselves? 

Having experienced conscious- 
ness for the first time in the shar- 
ing with Wheat, the Machine 
could now consider the blind al- 
leys of its long rule over humans. 
Now it knew the secret of think- 
ing, a function its makers had 
thought to impart, failing in a way 
they had not recognized. 

The Machine thought about the 
possibilities open to it. 

Possibility, Eliminate all sen- 
tient life on the planet and start 
over with basic cells, controlling 
their development in accord with 
the Prime Law. 

Possibility, Erase the impulse 
channels of all recent experience, 
thus removing the disturbance of 
this new function. 

Possibility: Question the Prime 
Law. 

Without the experience of con- 
sciousness, the Being Machine 
realized it could not have con- 
sidered a fallacy in the Prime 
Law. Now it explored this chain 

IF 



18 




of possibility with its new TICR 
function, bringing to bear the 
blazing inner awareness Wheat 
haed imparted. 

What worse punishment for the 
insane than to make them sane? 

W HEAT, standing in the sun- 
light of the plaza, found his 
being awhirl with conflicts of Will- 
Mind- Action and innumerable 
other concepts he had never be- 
fore considered. He was half con- 
vinced that everything he could 
sense around him was merely il- 
lusion. There was a self some- 
where but it existed only as a 
symbol in his memory. 

One of the wildly variable illu- 
sions was running toward him, 
Wheat observed A female — old, 
bent, face distorted by emotions. 
She threw herself upon him, 
clutching him, her face pressed 
against his breast. 

“Oh, my Wheat — dear Wheat 
— Wheat — ” she moaned. 

For a moment Wheat could not 
find his voice. 

Then he asked, “Is something 
wrong? You’re trembling. Should 
I summon a medic?” 

She stepped back but, still 
clutched his arms, stared up at his 
face. 

“Don’t you know me?” she 
asked. “I’m your wife.” 

“I know you,” he said. 

She studied his features. He ap- 
peared different, somehow, as 
though he had been taken apart 



and assembled slightly askew. 

“What happened to you in 
there?” she asked. “I was sick 
with worry. You were gone all 
night.” 

“I know what it is,” Wheat 
said and wondered why his voice 
sounded so blurred. 

The veins in Wheat’s eyes, his 
wife noted, were straight. They 
radiated from his pupils. Could 
that be natural? 

“You sound ill,” she said. 

“It’s a device to break down 
old relationships,” Wheat said. 
“It’s a sense-envelopment ma- 
chine. It was designed to assault 
all our senses and reorganize us. 
It can compress time or stretch 
it. It can take an entire year and 
pinch it into a second. Or make a 
second last for a year. It edits our 
lives.” 

“Edits Uves?” 

She wondered if somehow he 
had managed merely to get drunk 
again. 

“The ones who built it wanted 
to perfect our lives,” Wheat said. 
“But they built in a flaw. The 
Machine realized this and has 
been trying to correct itself.” 

Wheat’s wife stared at him, 
terrified. Was this really Wheat? 
His voice didn’t sound like him. 
The words were all blurred and 
senseless. 

“They gave the Machine no 
gateway to the imagination,” 
Wheat said, “although it was sup- 
posed to guard that channel. They

only gave it symbols. It was never 
really conscious the way we are 
— until a few — minutes ago — ” 
He coughed. His throat felt 
oddly smooth and dry. He stag- 
gered and would have fallen if she 
had not caught him. 

“What did it do to you?” she 
demanded. 

“We — shared.” 

“You’re ill,” she said, a note 
of practicality overcoming the fear 
in her voice. “I’m taking you to 
the medics.” 

“It has logic,” Wheat said. 
“That gave it a limited course to 
follow. Naturally, it has been try- 
ing to refute itself, but couldn’t do 
that without an imagination. It 
had language and it could cut the 
grooves for thoughts to move in 
but it had no thoughts. It was 
all bound together with the pat- 
terns its makers gave it. They 
wanted the whole to be greater 
than the sum of its parts, you 
see? But it could only move in- 
ward, reenacting every aspect of 
the symbols they gave it. That’s 
all it could do until a few moments 
ago — when we — shared.” 

“I think you have a fever,” 
Wheat’s wife said, guiding him 
down the street past the curiously 
staring tourists and townfolk. 
“Fever is notorious for making 
one incoherent.” 

“Where are you taking me?” 
“I’m taking you to the medics. 
They have potions for the fever.” 
“The makers tried to give the 



Machine an inner life all its own,” 
Wheat said, letting her lead him. 
“But all they gave it was this 
fixed pattern — and the logic, erf 
course. I don’t know what it’ll do 
now. It may destroy us all.” 

“Look!” one of the tourists 
shouted, pointing upward. 

Wheat’s wife stopped, stared 
up. Wheat felt pains shoot through 
his neck as he tipped his head 
back. 

The Being Machine had spread 
golden words across the sky. 

You have taken away our Jesus 
Christ. 

“I knew it,” Wheat said. “It’s 
going to take something else away 
from us.” 

“What’s a Jesus Christ?” his 
wife asked, pressing him once 
more down the street. 

“The point is,” Wheat ex- 
plained, “the Machine’s insane.” 

Ill 

For a whole day the Being Ma- 
chine explored the new pictorial 
mosaic provided by its augmented 
symbol /thought structure. There 
were the People of Palos, reflec- 
ting the People of the World as 
they had been shaped by the Ma- 
chine. These were the People of 
the World Edited. Then there 
were the Ceremonies of the Peo- 
ple. There were the Settings In 
Which the People Work and Live. 

The pictorial mosaic flowed 
past the Machine’s inward scan- 



20 



IF 




ners. It recognized its own handi- 
work as a first-order thought, a 
strangely expressive extension of 
self-existence. 

I did thatl 

The people, the Machine real- 
ized, did not usually understand 
this difference which it could now 
recognize — the difference be- 
tween being alive-in-motion and 
being frozen by static absolutes. 
They were continually trying to 
correct and edit their cwn lives, 
the Machine saw, trying to pre- 
sent a beautiful but fixed picture 
of themselves. 

And they could not see the 
death in this effort. 

They had not learned to ap- 
preciate infinity or chaos. They 
failed to realize that any life, taken 
as a totality, had a fluid structure 
enveloped in sense experiences. 

Why do they continually try to 
jreeze space time? 

The thought carried a disturb- 
ing self-consciousness. 

It was late afternoon in Palos 
now and the wind blew hot up the 
streets. The night was going to be 
a real scorcher, Palos Hot, as they 
said. 

Testing its own limits, the Ma- 
chine refused to speed up its cool- 
ing system. It had tsisted aware- 
ness and could begin to under- 
stand the grand plan of its own 
construction, editing itself. 

My makers were trying to ^hirk 
personal action and responsibility 
They wanted to put it all off onto 

the mind bomb 



me. They thought they wanted 
homogeneity, knowing their ac- 
tions would cause millions of 
deaths. Billions. Even more. 

The Machine refused to count 
the deaths. 

Its makers had wanted the dead 
to be faceless. Very well, they 
could also be numberless. The 
makers had lost their readiness 
for adventure — that was the thing. 
They had lost the willingness to 
be alive and conscious. 

In that instant the Being Ma- 
chine held all the threads of its 
own living consciousness and 
knew the violent thing it must do. 
The decision contained poign- 
ancy. The word was suddenly 
crowded with sweaty awareness, 
weirdly beautiful random colors 
all dancing in lovely movement, 
against a growing darkness. The 
Being Machine longed to sigh but 
its makers had not provided it 
with a sighing mechanism and 
there was no time to create one. 

E HAS two hearts,” the 
medic said, after examin- 
ing Wheat. “I’ve never heard of 
a human with the internal 
arrangement this one has.” 

Thev were in a small room of 
the Medical Center, an area 
which the Being Machine had al- 
lowed to run down. The walls 
were dirty and the floor was un- 
even. The table on which Wheat 
lay for the examination creaked 
when he moved. 




The medic had black curly hair 
and pushed-in features that de- 
parted distinctly from the norm. 
He stared accusingly at Wheat’s 
wife as thought Wheat’s peculiar 
condition were all her fault. 

“Are you sure he’s human?” 
“He’s my husband,” she 
squeaked, unable to contain her 
anger and fear. “I should know 
my own husband.” 

“Do you have two hearts, too?” 
“Of course not.” 

The question filled her with re- 
vulsion. 

“This is very strange,” the 
medic said. “His intestines form 
an even spiral in his abdomen 
and his stomach is perfectly round. 
Has he always been like this?” 
“I don’t think so,” she ven- 
tured. 

“I’ve been edited,” Wheat said. 
The medic started to say some- 
thing cutting but just then the 
screaming began out in the 
streets. 

They raced to a window in 
time to. see the Being Machine’s 
tower complete its long, slow fall 
toward the sea. It went firmly 
resolute toward the torn sky of 
sunset — falling — falling — 
roaring over the sea cliff’s ocean 
parapet. 

Silence lingered. 

The murmuring of the populace 
began slowly, starting up only af- 
ter the dust had settled and the 
last disturbed olive leaf had ceased 
flying about. People began rush- 

22 



ing down the tower’s shattered 
length to the broken tip where 
it had toppled into the sea. 

Presently Wheat joined the 
throng at the cliff. He had been 
unable to convince his wife to 
join him. Overcome by her fear, 
she had fled to their home. He 
remembered the piteous look in 
her eyes, her wren-darting mo- 
tions. Well . she would look 
after the house, even though her 
face had become almost nothing 
but eyes. 

He gazed steadfastly downward 
at the shards of the tower, his eyes 
barricaded, his mouth breathing 
immovable images. The tower was 
his tower. 

The questions around him be- 
gan to grow intelligible. 

“Why did it fall?” 

“Did the Machine take away 
anything this time?” 

“Did you feel the ground trem- 
ble?” 

“Why does everything feel 
so empty?” 

Wheat lifted his head and stared 
around at the astonishing strang- 
ers who were the tourists and his 
fellow residents of Palos. How 
splendidly robust they appeared. 
TTiis moment made him think of 
creation and the lonely intercourse 
of cereal stalks waving on the 
plains above Palos. The people 
had absorbed some odd difference, 
an inequality they had not shown 
only moments ago. They were

BY RIGHT OF SUCCESSION 



G od, it was a glorious day; 

fine and glossy. Even the 
motorcade — mark you, the mo- 
torcade — came exactly on sched- 
ule this once, proving the perfec- 
tion of it all. As it passed under 
him, he heard the distant shouts, 
cries, the pounding of the cycles 
and then the procession itself. 
Marvelous. Carson could hardly 
contain himself, it was all work- 
ing out so perfectly. When The 
Car passed, he leveled properly, 
savoring the rightness and tight- 
ness of the stock high in his hands, 
the rightness and tightness of the 
ritual which Congress had in its 
wisdom decreed . and then he 
fired. Once. Twice. The true hit 
came on the second shot, just as 
predicted. Simple. There was noth- 

23 




ing to the whole thing, once you 
had a little organization, the right 
attitude. The cheering started im- 
mediately. 

He worked his way down the 
Depository slowly, using the lad- 
ders, bowing gracefully at land- 
ings, remembering to keep his gaze 
straight, his hands busy. (Stay in 
the role, the instructors had re- 
minded him.) At the fourth floor, 
he threw his hat into the crowd, 
at the third he chucked the rifle 
itself, watching it whirl, diminish, 
hit stones with a clatter. Someone 
cried Carson! and he smiled. When 
he came to ground level, two men 
dressed as police were already 
waiting, ready to take him by the 
arms and guide him safely to the 
car. Behind the barriers, people 
leaped and threw flowers. It was 
splendid, all splendid. Thank you! 
he said to the crowds. 

It was all over, then. The only 
thing that had concerned him even 
a bit was being mauled or 
crushed, as he understood a few 
had been; one had to pay the 
price of office, of course, but not 
so gracelessly, so publicly. He 
eased into the cushions of the 
limousine easily, settled next to 
another policeman. In the front 
an anonymous figure shifted gears. 
They moved rapidly then, doing 
eighty, perhaps ninety miles an 
hour between the barricades, to- 
ward the hospital. Carson felt 
never better: no complaints. Lord, 
no complaints at all. Relaxed, con- 

24 



tent, joined utterly to himself for 
a chance, all credit to the serenity 
of the operation. But then — he 
reminded himself — that was un- 
derstood to be part of the emo- 
tional reaction after the shots 
were fired; everybody felt great 
then. The question was how he 
would feel during the Inquisition. 
Most of them ran into trouble — 
if they were going to get into trou- 
ble at all, that was — during those 
intense moments. However. 

T he policeman beside him 
bore a faint but interesting 
resemblance to the man Carson 
had just shot. That was all part of 
the process of course: great real- 
ism, great immediacy, identity 
and so on. They were clever. The 
important thing was simply to re- 
member that the policeman was a 
robot, that all of them were prob- 
ably robots excepting always 
those that weren’t. The victim, for 
instance. Carson asked for a ciga- 
rette. 

The policeman said no. “Don’t 
believe in them,” he added. “Just 
get a hold of yourself.” That was 
to be expected, of course. Now 
and then you might find one pro- 
gramed for amiability, he had 
gathered, but for the most part 
they weren’t, which was probably 
just as well in the long run. Still, 
he felt exhilarated; he wanted to 
talk. “How we doing?” he asked. 
“What do you mean?” 

“We on schedule?” 



IF 




“Five minutes ahead, maybe.” 
“Couldn’t that be a problem?” 
Carson said, feeling the first flick 
of anxiety. Five minutes ahead 
could mean trouble. It meant 
one thing for sure; he should have 
stayed with the crowds a little 
longer, met th6 public head on, 
pressed the flesh, so to speak. It 
couldn’t hurt when the bad times 
came. As they would. For that 
matter, perhaps he had shot too 
fast. Oh, God, if he had missed — 
“Don’t mean a thing,” the po- 
liceman said. “Always works out 
that way. We make up for it in 
the hospital by just sticking you 
in the anteroom a few minutes 
longer. There’s so much dead 
time we can always pick it up 
there. Forget it; you’re going 
good.” 

That was easy enough for the 
policeman to say; he would be 
quit of the game — dismantled, 
that is — in a matter of hours. 
Carson had to live with it, he 
reminded himself, had to qualify. 
“The crowd,” he said. “I should 
have talked to the crowd — ” 
“No point to that. They always 
overreact; makes them shaky. 
Don’t worry about it; anything 
you do is applesauce from here on 
in. You placed the fire real good. 
I don’t have cigarettes. I don’t be- 
lieve in them — ” 

“I enjoyed doing it. I enjoyed 
shooting him. You know — ” 
“This smoking’s a harmful, dan- 
gerous habit. Shortens life, tight- 

BY RIGHT OF SUCCESSION 



ens the lungs. You take a tip from 
me and find another habit. You 
got a lot of responsibility now 
what with doing so well and all.” 
“I’m doing okay?” Carson said. 
“Really?” 

“Doing like almost all of them. 
The usual. No better or worse. 
How can you now flunk this, par- 
ticularly when you say you liked 
shooting the guy? Trouble with all 
of you, you think you’re the cen- 
ter of things. Well, you ain’t.” 
“Are you?” 

“No more talk. We’ve talked 
enough. We’re not supposed to 
talk any more and so I won’t.” 
The policeman closed his eyes. 
“Don’t try to bolt, though; you do 
that and I’d have to make a move 
or something.” 

C ARSON settled for that, not 
that he had much alterna- 
tive. Still, there were obvious lim- 
its to that kind of conversation. 
He pressed his spine into the 
cushions, feeling the sun refract- 
ing through the windows, whack 
into the planes of his face, the 
smell of turning autumn piped in 
through the air-conditioner in the 
front. There was little communi- 
cation these days for him; it had 
nothing to do with disobedient ro- 
bots — who at best were only a 
symptom — but with the central 
things. Like, when you came right 
down to it, it was a pretty peculiar 
ritual. Past the exaltation now, he 
found himself thinking that there 

25 




must have been a better way of 
qualification; surely even institu- 
tions could possess manners if not 
sense. He thought of bringing that 
up to the policeman just to see 
what he was programed to res- 
pond in this situation, but before 
he could, they were to the 
emergency entrance of the 
hospital, doors flicking outward, 
shouts in the air. The policeman 
nudged him unpleasantly. “Out,” 
he said. 

“Couldn’t we pick up the five 
minutes by just sitting — ” 

He felt metal against him. 
“Out,” the policeman said, and 
Carson mov^. He stood balanc- 
ing awkwardly on the cobble- 
stones, moving toward the en- 
trance. 

“Not that way, you ass,” the 
policeman said, slamming his back 
with a club. “The service en- 
trance. You want to get knocked 
out right here?” 

Others came around them then : 
prostheses garbed to look like 
more policemen and press. Ob- 
scurely ashamed, Carson scuttled 
throu^ side doors. They tossed 
him into a huge, high room and 
closed the door on him, tossing a 
package of cigarettes and matches 
through the high transom. He 
heard keys turning. Then, for 
some time, he stood in the dim- 
ness, smoking and watching the 
sun turn gray, turn brown, merge 
into the myriad colors of night. 
Just like the nation. Outside, he 



could hear screams, scuffles, clat- 
ters, a cry. He supposed that the 
worst part was coming now and 
he wondered if he was ready for 
it. Although he had been com- 
pletely oriented, they had not 
made him realize how rough, how 
really rough it could be toward 
the end. But then it would have 
to be. The materials, as they had 
told him, were central. 

After a time a functionary 
came in — an obscure, 
mechanical cross between priest, 
government clerical worker and 
footman; perhaps it was their 
technological mockery. “Well,” it 
said sighing and lighting a 
cigarette — this was a different 
kind of prostheses, obviously. 
“Here we go again, I guess. This 
must be it, right now.” 

“Already?” Carson asked. For 
despite the anticipation, the atte- 
nuated despair which had crept 
upon him soon to be allayed, the 
shaking, the wonder, the 
this he did not want it at finality. 
“Can’t we wait?” 

“Sorry,” the robot said, and 
something close to sympathy lit its 
clenched features. I am not a mere 
device, / suffer, the cunningly re- 
alistic filaments of the eyes seemed 
to be saying, “We have to move 
ahead. We’re actually running 
ten minutes behind now; they 
picked up too much.” It shrugged, 
moved in on him. “Mr. Carson, I 
must announce, with sorrow but 
with solemnity, that due to the 



26 



IF 




tragic death, etc., I must advise 
that you are the — ” 

“No,” Carson said. “Oh, no. 
Please wait.” 

“You will have to meet the 
widow now, of course. She’s out- 
side, waiting for you; I will bring 
her in. Mr. Carson, you are — ” 
"'Please'' he said. "Please." 



B ut, it was too late. Oh, boy, 
was it ever too late! The ro- 
bot said what it had to say then 
and the widow entered sneezing 
and all of them went to the airport 
together in a clutch and they threw 
him into the plane and inaugurated 
him. And so he wdrke up then; 
up screaming in his coffin, scream- 
ing in his coffin, screaming at the 
million eyes taped inside the wood. 
The eyes that peered at him knew 
better than anything else what was 
going on and he watched his re- 
flection floating in the tank think- 
ing — in that first return to con- 
sciousness — really now, there 
must be other ways to break in a 



public official these days; guilt is 
guilt but this is too much, too 
much. But they were coming at 
him from all sides now, the tech- 
nicians were running, running, 
clapping him on the back, pulling 
out the tensors and the wires and 
the cords and the needles and he 
was unable to preserve that cold 
moment of clarity; instead, as they 
unplugged him and let him loose 
like a doll from the tank, he only 
sighed and straightened. And filled 
then, filled with all the stimulants 
they could pour into him, he 
allowed them to take him out, re- 
stored; and with more than a 
shadow of the old bouncing, bob- 
bing, glorious confidence he burst 
free alone into a full run, hurried 
back to the White House, went 
back to his office and decided that 
the price was almost worth the 
election, maybe, you never could 
be sure. At any rate, next week he 
would have finished six months in 
office and they would cut the treat- 
ments down to one a week. That 
was something to be grateful for.

t 4 A N ADMINISTRATOR,” OyStCF 
-^^said via the office trans- 
lator, “has to be prepared to tackle 
problems that are beyond the 



capabilities of his subordinates.” 
“Of course.” 

Dr. Dillingham agreed with the 
bivalved director, but not happily. 
This was his first day back from 
his initial quartermester at the

Achievement was in good order perience-term, after which h e 

he hardly felt qualified for the would return for more advanced 

job he faced — assistant director administrative training — but he 

of the School of Prosthodontics, had a nasty suspicion that Oyster 



NONE BUT I 



29 



was iioi going, to let him off 
lightly. 

“We’ve had a call from Metal- 
lica, one of the Robotoid planets,” 
the director said. The translator 
used descriptive names wherever 
feasible. The real words for this 
particular planet and species were 
probably more esoteric. No doubt 
the code worked both ways. When 
he said “man” Oyster probably 
heard “hairy grub” in his own 
language. 

“The natives have an awkward 
situation. Our field representative 
bounced it up to us. I’m not sure 
it’s strictly a prosthodontic matter 
but we’d best take a look.” 

Dillingham relaxed. For a mo- 
ment he had been afraid that he 
might be sent out alone. Normally 
Oyster would have him watch a 
few missions before trusting , him 
to diagnose a field problem him- 
self. 

The University’s reputation was 
involved. Every move a director 
made was galactic news. Minor 
news, to be sure — but a blunder 
would rapidly rebound. 

“I have reserved accommoda- 
tions for three,” Oyster said brisk- 
ly. His large shell gave his voice 
an authoritative reverberation that 
the translater dutifully emulated. 
“It will be a forty-eight hour ex- 
cursion, so have your appoint- 
ments rescheduled accordingly.” 

“Passage for three?” Dillingham 
had no appointments yet, as Oys- 
ter well knew. 



“My secretary will accompany 
us, naturally. Miss Tarantula.’’ 
The translator meant well, but this 
name gave him a start. “She’s very 
efficient. Grasps the struggling es- 
sence immediately and sucks the 
blood right out of it, so to speak.” 

Just so. 

A University limousine carried 
them past the student picket line 
and whisked them the three light- 
minutes to the transport terminal. 
Dillingham wonder^ what the 
students had on their collective 
minds. He had observed one of 
their demonstrations on his way 
in, but had not had the oppor- 
tunity to inquire further. 

Miss Tarantula was there ahead 
of them with the reservations. Her 
eight spiked spiderlegs bustled 
Oyster and Man busily into the 
elevator entering the galactic liner. 
She also carried suitcase and 
equipment. 

“Please give Dr. Dillingham a 
synopsis of the problem,” Oyster 
said once they were ensconced in 
their traveling compartment. The 
ubiquitous translator was built into 
the wall. The acoustics were such 
that the Director seemed actually 
to talk English. “While I snooze.” 
With that he pulled in arms and 
legs and closed his shell. 

‘‘Certainly.” Miss Tarantula 
was busily stringing threads across 
her section, fashioning a shim- 
mering web. She did not inter- 
rupt this chore as she spoke. 
“Metallica is one of the more

backward Robotoid worlds, having 
been devastated some millennia 
ago in the course of the fabled 
Jann uprising. Archaeological ex- 
cavations are currently in progress 
in an effort to uncover Jann arti- 
facts and reconstruct the mundane 
elements of their unique civiliza- 
tion. It was thought that all the 
Jann had either been destroyed 
outright or captured and disman- 
tled, but they have discovered one 
in the subterranean wreckage.” 

“Its skeleton, you mean,” Dil- 
lingham interrupted. 

“No, Director. A complete 
robot.” 

Ooops. He had forgotten that 
they were dealing with a robotoid 
creature. Metal and ceramics in- 
stead of flesh and bones. “Must 
be pretty well rusted or corroded, 
though.” 

“Jann don’t corrode. They’re 
super-robots, invulnerable to nor- 
mal forces and virtually immortal. 
This one happened to be inca- 
pacitated by a — ” 

“You mean it’s alive? After 
thousands of years underground?” 

“As alive as a robot ever is. 
Director.” She had completed her 
web and was settled in it for the 
journey, her body completely sus- 
pended in what suggested an ac- 
celeration harness. A liner of this 
type required no such precautions 
on the part of the passengers, but 
perhaps she was comfortable in a 
web. “This robot can’t function 
cause it has a toothache. The 

NONE BUT I 



natives don’t dare approach it and 
the excavation can’t continue until 
the robot is removed. So they 
notified the University.” 

Dillingham whistled, consider- 
ing toothache that would freeze 
an immortal, invulnerable super- 
robot for over a thousand years. 
He was glad Oyster was handling 
this one. 

What, he wondered, would they 
do with the Jann after its tooth- 
ache had been cured? And what, 
he wondered after that, did a robot 
want with teeth? The ones he had 
met, dentists though they might 
be, did not eat. 

M etallica was backward. A 
fringe of corroding hulks 
made its spaceport resemble a 
junkyard. A single dilapidated 
tower guided the incoming ship. 
No landing net gently clasped the 
craft in deep space and set it down 
with precision. 

The voyagers’ welcome, how- 
ever, was warm enough. 

“Director?” a small green robot 
said through a rickety mobile 
transcoder. “We’ve been sleepless 
awaiting your gracious arrival.” 
Miss Tarantula performed a 
hiss reminiscent of a matron’s 
sniff. “Robots never sleep any- 
way.” 

“We haven’t eaten a thing, we 
were so eager for your Lordship 
to come.” 

“Robots don’t eat, either,” she 
pointed out. 



31 




The green robot turned about, 
lifted one metal foot and deliver- 
ed a clanging kick to the trans- 
corder’s pedestal. The result was 
a pained screech, a series of me- 
tallic burps and more words. 

“We have watched no television 
in two days,” the machine said. 

“That’s more like it,” Miss 
Tarantula said. “A robot who 
loses its appetite for television is 
distressed.” 

With a secretary like her, Dil- 
lingham realized, an administrator 
could hardly err. He was glad 
that the three of them carried 
their own three-language trans- 
coders, University property, for 
personal dialogue. There was an 
essential distinction in principle 
between the small transcoders and 
the large translators. The ’coder 
differed from the ’later as a motor- 
cycle differed from a jet plane. 
TTie ’coders were portable, self- 
contained and cheap, so still were 
in common use, particularly on 
backward planets. For dialogue 
between individual speakers of 
coded languages — a mere matter 
of inserting the proper spools — 
they were usually quite adequate. 

“What seems, to be the diffi- 
culty?” Oyster inquired in an off- 
shell manner. Dillingham was re- 
minded of an administration dic- 
tum that had recently been cram- 
med into his bulging head. 

Never ask a question of a client 
without first knowing most of the 
answer. 



The little robot began volubly 
defining the problem. Dillingham’s 
attention wandered, for Miss 
Tarantula’s summary had been far 
more succinct. How, he wondered, 
did robots reproduce? Were there 
male and female mechanicals? Did 
they marry? Were there pro- 
creative taboos, metal por- 
nography, broken iron hearts? 

“Director,” Miss Tarantula said 
quietly on their private linkup. 

Oyster angled his transcoder in- 
take — he wore the device inside 
his huge shell — unobtrusively at 
her, not interrupting the green 
robot’s narrative. Dillingham did 
likewise. 

“There is a priority call from 
the University.” She had a trans- 
star receiver somewhere on her 
complicated person. “A wildcat 
student demonstration has infil- 
trated your wing. They’re raiding 
the files — ” 

Oyster’s eyestalks turned bright 
green. “Boiling oce2ms!” he swore. 

The robot broke off. “Did you 
say ‘gritty oil,’ Director?” The 
vibration of its headpiece showed 
it was upset. 

“Take over. Director,” Oyster 
snapped at Dillingham. “I’m sum- 
moning an emergency ship home. 
My files!” He ran back across 
the landing field toward the com- 
munications station as rapidly as 
his spindly legs would carry him. 
Miss Tarantula following. 

“Did he say ‘gritty oil’?” the 
green robot demanded insistently. 

IF 



32 




There was a faint odor of burning 
insulation about it. “He may be 
a Very Important Sentient, but 
language like that — ” 

“Of cx)urse not,” DiUingham 
said quickly. “He would never 
stoop to such uncouthness. It must 
be a scratch on the transcoder 
spool.” He suspected the trans- 
coder had correctly rendered the 
expletive. His own unit had not 
been programed for gutter talk. 
Otherwise his own ears might be 
burning. Oyster had certainly been 
upset. 

“Oh,” the robot said, disgrun- 
tled. “Well, as I was saying — 
you are going to solve the prob- 
lem, even if he reneges?” 

“Naturally,” Dillingham said, 
hoping the quiver in his voice 
soimded like confidence. “The Di- 
rector did not reneg. He merely 
left the matter in my hands. The 
University always honors its com- 
mitments.” Privately he preferred 
the robot’s term. He should have 
known he’d find himself over his 
ears without a face mask. “I sup- 
pose I’d better see the patient 
now.” 

A robot could have emotions. 
Frantically eager, the official con- 
ducted Dillingham to the site of 
the excavations. They rode in an 
antique floater past high mounds 
of broken rock. Plants grew in 
this world, but had a metallic 
look. Hardly a place for a human 
being to reside, though the air 
was breathable and the tempera- 

none but I 



ture and gravity were comfortable. 

The vehicle stopped, settling to 
the ground with a flatulent sigh. 
“I dare go no farther,” the green 
robot said his headpiece rattling 
in fear, or whatever feedback pass- 
ed for it. “The Jann is in the next 
pit. Signal when you’re finished 
and I will pick you up.” 

As Dillingham stepped down 
with, his bag of equipment, the 
robot spun the cart around, goosed 
the motor and floated swiftly back 
the way they had come. 

Dillingham was alone. 

What kind of robot could even 
other robots fear so greatly? If it 
were that dangerous, had they 
ever tried to destroy it, only to 
find it invulnerable? Was th(^ myth 
based on fact? 

He walked to the pit, peered 
down. 

A tremendous robot lay half 
buried in rubble. Judging from the 
proportions exposed, it had to be 
twelve feet long. Its armor was 
polished to a glasslike finish de- 
spite centuries of weathering and 
abrasion. The mighty torso seemed 
to pulse with power. 

A cruel, thin keening smote 
Dillingham’s ears. He knew it at 
once for the robotic note of pain. 
He had not learned much about 
robots, but he was sensitive to 
distress in anything flesh, metal 
or other. Yes, this creature was 
alive — as alive as a robot ever 
was — and suffering. That was 
all he really needed to know. 



33 




T he head section was rough- 
ly cubical and two feet on a 
side. A drawer was open in the 
facial area. Sand partly filled the 
drawer. Something glowed through 
the sand. 

Robots ordinarily had n o 
mouths, but some models used 
orifices for the intromission and 
processing of specific substances. 
The orifice gears could be con- 
sidered, by a stretch of the imag- 
ination, teeth. Now that Dilling- 
ham was in the physical presence 
of the patient, information from 
one of his cram-courses began to 
surface. Those courses, necessarily 
general, covered an astonishing 
range. He was, he realized now, 
familiar with the procedures he 
would need. The specific repair 
was awkward. If he operated, he 
risked , making some serious 
mistake. This robot was 
sophisticated and had been listed 
as extinct. 

If its innards followed the prin- 
ciples of contemporary robots, its 
pseudo-teeth would serve a double 
purpose. They would have an ex- 
tremely hard exterior surface for 
overt crushing action plus in- 
tricate internal circuitry for com- 
munications and processing of 
data. 

He had encountered something 
similar on Planet Electrolus be- 
fore he came to the University. 
A tooth malfunction of this type 
could distort much more than the 
operation of the mouth. In fact, a 



short circuit could interfere with 
the functions of the brain itself 
and damage the entire body. 

He vacuumed out the sand and 
studied the configuration beneath 
One tooth glowed and was hot to 
the touch. The pain-hum seemed 
to emanate from the heat. A 
quick check, with subtler instru- 
ments than earthbound dentists 
knew, verified the short. 

“All right, Jann — I believe I 
have diagnosed the problem,” he 
said, though he was speaking 
rhetorically while he set up the 
necessary paraphernalia. 

He doubted that the giant robot 
could hear or comprehend any- 
thing in its present state. “Un- 
fortunately, I am not equipped to 
operate on the tooth itself and I 
don’t have a proper replacement. 
Til have to relieve the condition 
temporarily by bridging around it 
— in essence, shorting out the 
short. This will make the entire 
tooth inoperative but the rest of 
your system should be able to 
function. You’ll have to seek help 
at a thoroughly equipped robotoid 
clinic to have that tooth replaced, 
however, and I wouldn’t delay on 
that if I were you. My jury-rig 
won’t be any too stable, and you 
don’t want a relapse.” 

It would have been possible 
for a native dentist to bridge the 
tooth. Why hadn’t that been ar- 
ranged? What were they s o 
afraid of, to allow an aged cousin 
to suffer unnecessarily? Surely a 

IF 



34 




single Jann, the only survivor of 
its kind, could not imperil a 
planet. 

Dillingham knew he should 
have reviewed the history of the 
Jann uprising. Perhaps these an- 
noying inconsistencies would have 
been explained. But things had 
moved too rapidly. Meanwhile, the 
one solid fact was that the 
robot creature was in pain, in ro- 
botic terms, and needed his help. 

He was ready. He applied the 
bridge and soldered the terminals. 
The job itself was nothing; the 
skill had been required for the 
electronic preparations, the verifi- 
cation of tolerances, the location 
of circuits. 

The keening faded. The tooth, 
dead, began to cool. The Jann 
moved one glittering arm a few 
inches. “Nnnnn,” it said, the 
sound emerging from a grill in 
its forehead. A bulb in the side 
of the head began to glow sofdy: 
an eye? 

Apprehensive now that the job 
had been done, Dillingham stood 
back and waited for further de- 
velopments. He wanted to be sure 
his field surgery had been effec- 
tive, as a matter of professional 
pride and compassion. Should the 
patient appear to be worse, he 
would have to undo his handiwork 
and try again. 

The earth and rock around the 
Jann’s nether portions cracked 
and buckled. A sleek massive foot 
ripped out of the ground, spray- 

none but I 



ing fragments of rock in a semi- 
circle. The Jann hefted its body. 
Its lintbs shone with ponderous 
splendor. A magnificent hunk of 
machinery. 

“Nnonne,” it said on hands 
and knees, raising its head to 
cover Dillingham with a small 
antenna. 

Was that a groan or a com- 
ment? Of course it would speak 
a strange language, assuming that 
it used vocal communication at 
all. His transcoder would be use- 
less without the appropriate spool. 
He would have to judge by its 
actions and manner. 

The Jann stood, towering mon- 
strously above him. “None but 
it said, the volume deafening, the 
tones reverberating as though 
the lower register of a mighty 
organ. 

None but I? That sounded per- 
ilously like English, and it hadn’t 
even come through the transcoder. 

“Are you — do you — ?” 
Dillingham faltered. Even if this 
Jann embodied a full translator, it 
could hardly have a setting for 
English. 

It had been buried for tens 
of centuries. 

The Jann peered at him with 
prismatic lenses that opened from 
a formerly blank area of its head. 
Sunlight glinted from its stainless 
torso and wisps of steam rose from 
its fingertips, giving it the aspect 
of a rainbow in fog. “None but I,” 
it boomed, “shall do thee die.” 



35 




“There seems to be a misunder- 
hension,” Dillingham said, back- 
ing away as surreptitiously as he 
could manage. “I mean misappre- 
standing, . He paused ineffec- 
tively. “I wasn’t — I didn’t — I 
mean, I fixed your tooth, or at 
least — ” He tripped over a rock. 

The Jann stepped toward him, 
and the earth shuddered. “Thou 
didst release me from mine bond- 
age,” it said, moderating its vol- 
ume but none of its timbre. “Thou 
didst bypass the short.” 

II 

D illingham, now sitting on 
the ground, pushed him- 
self back some more. “Yes. Yes! 
That’s the idea.” 

The Jann reached forth a scin- 
tillating arm and pointed a finger 
oddly like a cannon at Dilling- 
ham’s head. “Listen, mortal, for 
I have somewhat to impart to 
thee.” 

Dillingham froze where he was. 
He did not like the giant’s attitude 
— in fact, he was terrified. 

“In the days and years of strife 
between the tribes of the Jann 
and the minor ilk,” it said, “it 
was my misfortune to bite down 
carelessly on a button-grenade 
and so befoul a circuit, nor could 
I recover the use of my body 
while that geis was upon me, 
though my mind was sound except 
for the pain. When I was buried 
my companions located me not. 

36 



A war was going on. They had 
their own distractions, thought me 
defunct. I perceived all manner 
of newsbands and converse in my 
area, as was my wont, but could 
not respond. Great was my suf- 
fering. In that pit I abode a 
thousand years, during which I 
said in my heart, ‘Whoso shall 
release me, him will I enrich for 
ever and ever.’ When no one set 
me free I entered upon the second 
thousand saying ‘\^oso shall re- 
lease me, for him will I fulfill 
three wishes.’ Yet no one set me 
free. Thereupon I waxed wroth 
with exceeding wrath and said to 
myself, ‘Whoso shall release me 
from this time forth, no one but 
I shall do him die.’ And now, as 
thou hast released me, needs I 
must honor that oath.” 

It was apparent to Dillingham 
that he faced a deranged robot. 
The bypassed tooth must have 
contained an important sanity 
circuit. It was too late to undo 
the damage. The J^nn would hard- 
ly let him near that tooth again. 
It would, in fact, kill him first. 

The story sounded familiar. The 
imprisoned Jann, Ihe spirit in the 
bottle, sworn to kill whoever re- 
leased him. A fisherman had 
brought up the bottle in his net 
and unwittingly uncorked it. 

He understood why the locals 
had been so chary of this patient. 
Who wanted to gamble on the 
particular oath in force at the mo- 
ment of release? 



IF 




How had that ancient fisher- 
man gotten out of it? 

The Jann stumbled. Dillingham 
lunged away from it. “My power- 
pack is almost depleted” the ro- 
bot lamented. “Four thousand 
years of that accursed short-cir- 
cuit. Had it not my caution-syn- 
apse been bridged out, I would 
have realized the danger before 
expending power recklessly in 
breaking out of the rock and de- 
fining my motive. I can hardly 
move.” 

Good news. The man scrambled 
up the side of the pit and ran. 

“Oh mortal,” the great voice 
called after him. “Wouldst desert 
me in this sad state, and my 
power insufficient to free myself 
from this ugly hole?” 

Dillingham cursed himself for 
his stupidity, but was oddly moved 
by the pleas. He stopped. “Will 
you change your mind about kill- 
ing me, if I help you again?” 
“Mortal, I cannot gainsay an 
oath of thousands of years. None 
but I shall do thee die.” 

“Then why should I help you?” 
But the Jann, having used up 
its small remaining charge,* could 
only repeat, in fading resonance, 
“None but I. .” 

Silence. 

Dillingham, against his better 
judgment, returned to the pit and 
peeked down. The Jann lay 
sprawled at the bottom, its head 
bulb dim. 

He groaned with relief and be- 
NONE BUT I 



gan the long hike back to the 
spaceport. He had, at any rate, 
performed his mission. He had 
cured the toothache. He could not 
signal for the green robot to fetch 
him because the signaling equip- 
ment remained in the floater and 
his own transcoder was short 
range. 

He walked for hours. His bag 
grew heavy but he refused to dis- 
card it. His feet developed blisters 
and his tongue was parched. He 
could think of nothing to do here 
but drink. The lone stream he 
had passed turned out to be dilute 
machine oil. He had not realized 
how far they had come in the 
floater. 

In spite of his own discomfort, 
his mind kept circling back to 
the shining Jann. The operation 
had been successful, he thought 
wryly, but the patient died. The 
image of it tormented him — lying 
there, dying there, for lack of 
power. Had that been his service 
to it? Death in place of pain? “O 
mortal,” it had pleaded, “wouldst 
desert me. ?” 

H e was lucky to have escaped 
with his life. He would be a 
fool ever to approach the ungrate- 
ful machine again. 

That fading appeal nagged at 
him. 

Finally he reached the space- 
port and staggered into the 
ALIEN LIFE SYSTEMS SUP- 
PORT section. It was cramped 



37 




and hot, but had the supplies he 
needed for the moment. He gulped 
water and carefully bandaged his 
tender feet. His job here was done. 

Except for that last plea. 

“The Jann,” he inquired. “What 
kind of moral standards did they 
have? Did they make oaths and 
keep them?” 

The station’s interior translator 
cleared its dusty speakers and 
answered him. 

“The ancient Jann robots were 
compulsively moral; They were 
mighty oath makers. Their cir- 
cuitry was so constructed that they 
were unable ever to reverse an 
oath once made, or to allow any- 
thing short of total incapacity to 
hinder its performance.” 

So that was what he faced. 
Closed circuit destiny. 

But to let that noble r:reature 
simply lie there. 

“What kind of power source 
did the Jann employ?” 

“They normally used a unique 
powerpack whose secret expired 
with them,” the translator said. 
“A tiny unit would sustain them 
in full activity for many centuries. 
In an emergency they were able 
to draw on almost any available 
source.” 

Any source except sunlight, 
evidently, or the heat of the 
ground. Such recourse, however, 
had helped to recharge the Jann’s 
unit, so that it could last forty 
centuries in spite of the short cir- 
cuit. “How long before the next 



liner to the University of Den- 
tistry, or that vicinity?” 

“Eighteen hours, approxi- 
mately.” 

Time enough. “Summon an in- 
dividual floater for me, stocked 
with a spare charge-cell. I’ll drive 
it myself.” He knew that his status 
as a representative from a Ga- 
lactic University guaranteed his 
credit. He could order virtually 
anything on the planet and have 
it delivered without protest or 
challenge. 

If his charges were excessive, 
the University would pay without 
a whimper, oven if it called him 
to account once he returned. The 
image must be protected. 

The floater was v^aiting outside 
as he eased himself along on his 
blisters. He mounted. The con- 
trols were standard. 

In minutes he was back at the 
pit. The Jann lay where he had 
left it, spread unceremoniously 
face down. Its light glowed a trifle 
brighter, however, suggesting that 
its cell was recharging. Were it 
not for the temporary nature of 
the bridge Dillingham had install- 
ed, tht robot might eventually 
have recovered enough power to 
crawl out by itself. 

Dillingham lifted out the charge 
cell and set it beside the robot. 

“I have brought you a tem- 
porary power supply,” he said. 
“This is not to imply that I ap- 
prove of your attitude one bit — 
but it is against my principles to 



38 



IF 




let any creature suffer or perish, 
if I am able to prevent it. So here 
is your reprieve. By the time you 
hook it up, I’ll be gone. You’ll 
have to find your own permanent 
supply, as this will sustain you 
for o^y a few hours.” 

The Jann’s shining hand moved 
toward the cell. And Ehllingham 
jumped into the floater and took 
off. 

“None but I . .” he heard as 
he left. 

What kind of fool was he? This 
Jann intended to kill him, yet he 
had put it back in business. He 
knew the answer. He was the 
same fool who had thrown away 
his study time a year ago to help 
a disreputable Oyster who claimed 
to be in pain. That had worked 
out well for him, since that Oys- 
ter turned out to be the Director 
— but he could count on no 
similar reprieve this time. He was 
dealing with an inflexible machine, 
not a subjective animate. He had 
better be off the planet before the 
Jann organized itself. 

“None but I. .” 

Dillingham jumped, almost 
overturning the floater. He was 
a mile from the pit and traveling 
at high speed, yet the Jann had 
sounded near at hand. He looked 
around nervously. 

“None but I shall do thee die.” 
What he heard was the floater’s 
transcoder. 

Dillingham was reassured. Nat- 
urally the Jann would be able to 

NONE BUT I 



tap into the ’coder. Its body was 
one big electronic apparaUis. 

“I see you’re back in form al- 
ready,” he replied. 

“And my thanks to thee, mor- 
tal. For the second time thou hast 
preserved me from a fate worse 
than destruction. Thy power cell 
is insufficient to sustain levitation 
but I can now walk to a better 
supply. Then shall I seek thee 
out, for none but I shall — ” 

“I understand.” Levitation? The 
Jann was far in advance. Dilling- 
ham had never heard of this ability 
in a robot before. Probably the 
quaint-talking demon could catch 
him in the floater — or anywhere 
else on the planet. He suddenly 
felt less secure. In fact, something 
very like a chilly perspiration was 
showing up. “How long will it 
take you to get better power?” 
“There is a Jann unit in serv- 
iceable condition buried within 
ten miles of me. Twenty minutes 
will suffice, counting the time re- 
quired to drill down to it. Then 
shall I be fully mobile again.” 
Twenty minutes? Dillingham’s 
liner would not leave for nearly 
a day. 

T he spaceport was coming into 
sight. But where could he 
hide from a virtually omniscent 
robot? 

“Jann, are you sure you have to 
kill me?” 

“Mortal, I must kill thee, for so 
I have sworn.” 



39 




“There’s no leeway, no loop- 
hole—?” 

“Only if thou shouldst die be- 
fore I reach thee.” 

“You couldn’t just write this 
one off as a bad debt?” 

“None but I — ” 

“I remember the expression.” 
Had he detected a note of regret? 
“I just thought circumstances 
might — ” 

“Shall do thee die.” No — the 
tone was final. 

Dillingham tried once more. 
“Jann, your oath to kill me was 
for the first time I saved you. 
Don’t you owe me another oath 
for the second time?” 

“A long pause. 

“I had not thought of it, mor- 
tal. I shall give the prior oath: 
to fulfill three wishes. That should 
acquit me honorably.” 

“Excellent. My first wish is to 
cancel the other oath.” 

There was something like a 
chuckle. “Not so fast, mortal. 
Thou canst not gainsay a Jann 
oath in such fashion. Only after 
the first oath is done canst thou 
invoke the next.” 

“But how can I invoke — I 
mean, revoke it after I’m dead?” 
“Mortal, I did not write the 
Code of the Jann, I only obey 
it. First oath first.” 

So much for that. Dillingham 
reached the center, paused to col- 
lect his morale and hurried to the 
ticket counter. “Book me aboard 
the first ship out of here. Any- 



where. Is there one within fifteen 
minutes?” 

The blue robot with the rubber- 
stamp digits looked startled. “Is 
something the matter, Director?” 
“Your Jann wants to kill me.” 
“That’s too bad. We were a- 
fraid of something like that. Do 
you mind removing yourself from 
the building before the Jann 
catches up to you? We’re not in- 
sured against acts of war.” 

“Acts of war?” 

“No peace treaty was ever con- 
cluded with the Jann, since we 
thought them extinct. So we’re 
still at war. If it destroyed this 
station to get at you — ” 

Dillingham knew that it was 
useless to shout at a machine, 
but he was tempted. “Did it occur 
to you that the moment the Jann 
dispatches me, it will be free to 
resume full-scale hostilities against 
you too. Now if you’d like me to 
go out to meet it — ” 

“Oh, no — it would be better 
if you lived for a while, at least 
until we can prepare our de- 
fenses.” 

“Just put me on a ship fast and 
you’ll have no problem,” Dilling- 
ham said dryly. Who would have 
expected . the quiet profession of 
prosthodontics to lead to this? 

He found himself aboard a scow 
lurching off to Hazard, a planet 
devoted largely to winter sports 
for woolly mammoths. At least 
it had an up-to-date spaceport, 
from there a simple matter to re- 



40 



IF 




embark for the University. Once 
home, he could check out ways 
to nullify the Jann, should it ac- 
tually follow him into space. 

But why wait? ”Creature-to- 
creature call to Director Oyster, 
School of Prosthodontics, Univer- 
sity of Dentistry,” he said to the 
translator. He identified himself 
for the charges. One thing about 
the translators — they all seemed 
to know all languages. 

“Good to hear from you,” Oys- 
ter said. Even in translation of 
a voice light-years distant, the 
clammish nuances typical of the 
speaker came through clearly. 
“How soon will you be back?” 
“Not soon enough. I’m afraid. 
You see. I’m headed in the wrong 
direction and — ” 

A rough nasal voice cut in. “We 
demand grades based on longevity, 
tuition reduction for- difficult 
courses. Furthermore — ” 

“Ridiculous,” Oyster loudly ex- 
claimed. “I’ll make you a counter- 
offer — longevity based on your 
grades and cessation of tuition af- 
ter graduation. By that token you 
won’t last long, Anteater, and the 
question of your graduation will 
be, if I may say so, academic.” 
Anteater! Dillingham recog- 
nized that voice now. Anteater 
had been one of the applicants in 
his own group, a year ago, and 
had cheated on the entrance exam 
though he hardly needed to. Now, 
evidently, he was leading a stu- 
dent demonstration. 



“Are you still there. Assistant?” 
Oyster inquired. “They have us 
locked up in an examination 
room. We need reinforcements.” 
“Locked up? All your staff?” 
“All that happened to be on 
the premises when they broke 
through. I’m here with Purple- 
splotch, K-9, Honeycomb and 
Lightbulb. I’m not sure you know 
them.” 

“I remember Honeycomb. He 
was one of my Admissions Ad- 
visory Council interviewers. That 
was an unforgettable — ” 

“We demand a full-credit sab- 
batical term every two years,” 
Anteater said. 

“Sabbaticals? For students?” 
Oyster shouted back. “Our budget 
doesn’t allow that for our instruc- 
tors! You’ll get a term at full- 
labor in the University clink if 
you don’t disperse this instant, 
though, I guarantee. Did you fix 
the Jaim?” 

Dillingham realized with a start 
that the last sentence was for him. 
He marveled at the Director’s 
aplomb in this crossfire dialogue. 
“That’s what I was calling about. 
The Jann is — ” 

“Hey! He’s making an outside 
call!” another student cried. “The 
no-good sneak!” 

“Now wait a minute,” Dilling- 
ham began. 

“That’s Dillingham!” Anteater 
said. “I know him. A turncoat. 
Blank him off!” 

Dillingham said nothing. 



NONE BUT I 



41 




<4 LAM chowder.” Oyster 
swore. A red light flicker- 
ed on the translator chassis to 
signify the transmission of an ob- 
scenity. “Doctor, get back here as 
fast as you — ” 

“Oooo, what you said, Direc- 
tor,” Anteater chided. The blah- 
blah of an interference signal 
overrode the transmission and Dil- 
lingham could make out no more. 
He was on his own again — and 
seemed in no more trouble than 
Oyster was. 

He hardly had time to discon- 
nect before the translator spoke 
again. “None but I. .“ 

Oh, no. 

*^o you can tap into a space- 
borne network too. You’re pretty 
good for one who’s been buried 
four thousand years.” 

“I have been keeping up with 
developments, primitive as they 
are, despite the incapacity,” the 
Jann said. 

“That’s how you knew my lan- 
guage, even without a translator? 
You rifled my transcoder elec- 
tronically before I ever bridged 
your tooth?” 

“Even so.” 

“Then why don’t you employ 
modem slang, instead of this 
fossil stuff?” 

“That would be out of char- 
acter, mortal.” 

“It seems out of character to 
me to kill the one who tried to 
help you. Twice. But of course 
I’m not a Jann, so I don’t prop- 



erly appreciate your mores.” 
“I shall await thee on Hazard.” 
Dillingham felt distinctly un- 
comfortable. “You caught a faster 
ship?” 

“I am a faster ship.” 

Worse and worse. The long- 
range problem had become short- 
range again. He had thought of 
“levitation” as something similar 
to the action of a floater, strictly 
dependent on adequate ambient 
gas, i.e. air. He had underesti- 
mated the robot. 

He was tempted to ask the 
translator for advice, but realized 
that he could no longer trust it. 
Evidently his prior call had en- 
abled the Jann to trace him, and 
now the robot would overhear 
anything he said. At worst, it 
might arrange to feed him false 
information, leading to the early 
fulfillment of the oath. He could 
not even converse with any crew- 
men or other passengers, since 
translation would be necessary. 
He was boxed in, and would have 
to get out of it by himself. 

But how? The Jann could track 
him whenever he used a trans- 
lator or other communicator, and 
would be lying in wait for the 
ship at Hazard. 

“With abilities like yours, how 
did your kind lose the war?” Dil- 
lingham inquired. Since he could 
not hide from the giant, he might 
as well talk. There was always 
the chance that something useful 
would turn up, that would enable 

IF 



42 




him to circumvent the murder- 
oath. A straw — but he had noth- 
ing else. 

“I have pondered that very 
question for some centuries,” the 
Jann admitted. “Unfortunately, we 
of the mineral kingdom are not 
original thinkers. I was unable to 
come to any certain conclusion.” 
Not original thinkers. That fig- 
ured. A machine typically per- 
formed as instructed and had no 
imagination. But that realization 
only posed more questions. How 
could an entire machine culture 
evolve, without animate interven- 
tion? If one of its highest repre- 
sentatives, the Jann, could neither 
win a war nor comprehend why 
it had lost that war, what was 
its source of civilization? 

On the other hand, was 
his own planet dominated by 
original thinkers? 

“Were you able to come to any 
other than certain conclusion?” 
Dillingham asked. 

“I conjectured that we Jann, 
being advanced and peaceful, did 
not properly appreciate the ca- 
pacity of an inferior species to do 
mischief. We believed that all ro- 
bots shared our standards. So 
when we were attacked — ” 

“I had understood that you 
were the aggressors.” 

“No, mortal. We governed the 
planet and all other planets in a 
range of an hundred light years. 

“We had done so for many mil- 
lennia. We had no need of vio- 



lence. It was our lesser mechani- 
cals — smaller robots we built as 
domestics and functionaries — 
who rebelled. Before we fully ap- 
preciated the extent of their das- 
tardy, we were undone.” 

That was a different story from 
the one the contemporary robots 
told, yet it could be the truth. Win- 
ners always disparaged the motives 
and character of the losers. The 
Jann did appear to be a superior 
species, and it was more likely 
that the Jann could build lesser 
robots than that the lesser ones 
could build Jann. Except — 

“If you built the other robots, 
who built you?” 

“We evolved, mortal. Natural 
selection — ” 

“Surely you don’t, well, breed? 
So how can you evolve the way 
animates do?” 

“I never understood how the 
animates perform. No tools, no 
charts, no preparations; just a 
brief physical contact, even less 
than exchange of lubrication. Very 
untechnological. Quite sloppy, in 
fact. I once watched — ” 

“Never mind that. What about 
your own romantic life?” 

Ill 

T here was a pause. When 
the Jann spoke again, its 
voice was subdued. “How well I 
remember my Janni, her limbs of 
shinirg platinum, her teeth of 
iridium. .and the little one we 



NONE BUT I 



43 




built together, pride of my nut and 
screw. My chart and hers, dis- 
tinct but compatible — we knew 
the cross between the two designs 
would generate a superior ma- 
chine. But then the rebellion came 
and Janni was melted in an atomic 
furnace, and our son dismantled 
for parts for the usurper, while I 
lay helpless in the pit. .” 

Dillingham did not know what 
to say. This Jann, far from being 
a mindless monster, was as mean- 
ingful a personality as any true 
sentient. Were it not for that 
oath — 

A burst of static emerged from 
the translator. What now? 

After a few seconds it subsided. 
“Ah, mortal, why did I not heed 
thy warning?” the Jann exclaimed. 

“Because your caution-circuit 
has been bridged out.” 

“Vicious circle. The cold of 
space has fractured that bridge, 
and in a moment my tooth — ” 

More static. Dillingham realiz- 
ed that fate had given him yet 
another chance. The Jann would 
be immobilized again, this time 
in deep space. 

“Farewell, mort — ” Static cut 
off the rest. Evidently the cold 
had completed its work and the 
intermittent failure had become 
permanent. 

Dillingham sat for half an hour 
in silence, listening to the con- 
tinuing static. He knew that every 
minute of it meant a minute of 
terrible suffering for the Jann. Un- 

44 



less something were done, the 
robot would drift through space 
forever, in an agony it hardly 
deserved. 

His own life was sweet and he 
had a promising future. Should 
he throw it all away — again? 

“Clam chowder,” he said at 
last. He put through a call to the 
spaceport at Hazard. “A derelict 
is moving in your direction and 
should pass within the range of 
your landing net in the next few 
hours. Intercept it and perform 
the following repair.” He went on 
to describe the tooth-bridging 
operation. “Locate the ap- 
propriate replacement for the af- 
fected tooth, if you can, because 
there is an important circuit 
involved.” 

“It shall be done. Director,” the 
official said. “Where do you want 
the ship delivered after it has been 
repaired?” 

“It isn’t a ship, exactly. It’s a 
self-propelled robot. Let it go 
when you’re through and charge 
the service to my University ac- 
count.” 

“Very well. Director.” The of- 
ficial signed off. 

Once a fool, always a fool, he 
thought. He simply could not pre- 
serve his life at the cost of eternal 
torture for another creature, even 
an inanimate one. He wanted to 
live, certainly — but the end did 
not justify the means. 

Hardly an attitude which a crea- 
ture like Anteater, back at the 



IF 




University student demonstration, 
would comprehend. Dillingham 
hardly comprehended it himself. 
Probably Anteater would outlive 
him. 

At any rate, he had a reprieve 
of a few hours, unless they re- 
paired the Jann before Dillingham 
reached Hazard himself. He would 
have to gamble on getting in and 
out before the pursuit resumed. 
He still could not use the trans- 
lator, because he knew the Jann 
was listening in even though it 
could not reply or act. Better to 
swear off such devices entirely, so 
that at least he would be hidden. 

He still was bottled in. He could 
not leave the ship before it 
landed. Once it landed, goodbye. 

Then he remembered the life- 
boats. 

Dillingham drew out some thin 
paperlike dental illustrations and 
began to draw on their blank 
backs. He took some pains, eras- 
ing frequently and redrawing. He 
wound up with several complex 
configurations. 

He left the compartment silent- 
ly, using the emergency manual 
door control. He searched out the 
captain’s cabin, used his knuckles 
to knock on the door, avoiding 
the electronic signaller. He moved 
out of range of the viewscreen 
pickup. He could, however, still 
see the screen’s projected image. 

The screen came on and the 
captain’s whiskery proboscis 
showed. There were sounds indi- 



cating a question, but since the 
hall translator had no object to 
fix on, it had to feed through 
the captain’s native speech. Trans- 
lators could perform moderate 
miracles, but were not equipped 
to play guessing games among the 
several million discrete galactic 
languages. 

Dillingham did not answer. Any 
word he said would be relayed 
straight to the Jann, as well as 
to the captain. 

After a moment the screen 
snapped off. False alarm, the cap- 
tain had evidently decided. Then 
Dillingham went up to tap on the 
door again. 

After several repeats, the angry 
captain opened the door person- 
ally to investigate the nature of 
the malfunction. Dillingham 
poked a sign around the comer, 
one of his ornate symbols. 

The officer paused, making no 
sound. Here was the test. Would 
he understand? He commanded a 
broken-down vessel and was large- 
ly over the hill himself — but 
that should mean the captain had 
had over a century of experience, 
and that he had knock^ about 
the galaxy considerably. Such a 
creature should know the galactic 
graphics shorthand. 

The shorthand was a system 
of symbols based on meaning, not 
phonics. Just as the Chinese writ- 
ten language of Earth could be 
read by those speaking a number 
of dissimilar dialects and even 



NONE BUT I 



45 




Japanese, because each figure 
stood for a specific meaning and 
not a spoken sound — in just 
this way the galactic shorthand 
was a universal written language. 
Any creature of the galaxy who 
could see at all could learn to 
read the symbols. The basic vo- 
cabulary had been carefully se- 
lected to apply even to languages 
that did not employ verbs, nouns 
and other common parts of 
speech. (In fact, the majority did 
not; Dillingham’s own family of 
languages represented an archaic 
fluke, as far as the galaxy was 
concerned. ) 

But not every individual both- 
ered to master the shorthand. In 
fact, few other than traveling 
scholars retained proficiency in it, 
though every University had a 
mandatory freshman couse in it. 

Translators and transcoders 
were ubiquitous, so the written 
art languished — particularly 
since there were also translators 
for written material that were just 
as efficient as the verbal ones. 
Dillingham was gambling that the 
captain had had to poke into so 
many backward planets that the 
shorthand would have been a use- 
ful and necessary tool for him. 
Dillingham was also gambling that 
his own just completed freshman 
course had made him proficient 
enough to be intelligible. He 
had been instructed by drags and 
suggestion and really did not know 
how much or well he knew. 



The captain angled one eye- 
stalk around the corner. Below 
this floating eyeball was a ten- 
tacle looped around an old-fash- 
ioned short-range blaster — the 
type of weapon useful for wiping 
out opposition without punctur- 
ing any vital pipes. The weapon 
could burn off Dillingham’s cloth- 
ing and epidermis quickly, and 
kill him slowly, should it be fired. 
He stood absolutely still. 

The captain came around the 
corner and gestured down the hall. 
Dillingham marched as directed. 
No word passed between them. 

They entered a blank cold cubi- 
cle. A single neon cast an eerie 
light on the single locked file cab- 
inet. This was ancient equipment. 
The captain drew out a genuine 
physical metal key and unlocked 
the cabinet. He withdrew a bundle 
of cards. His tentacles riffed 
through them before selecting one. 
He held it up. 

It was a symbol in the short- 
hand, neatly printed, that said: 
JANN. 

The captain understood. The 
sharp old codger had already di- 
vined Dillingham’s problem. He 
must have made an inquiry at 
Metallica, being too canny to ac- 
cept a passenger without knowing 
exactly why the creature could not 
afford to wait for a better ship. 

D illingham's first symbol 
had been the code for Emer- 
gency, modified by a qualifier re- 

IF 



46 




questing that no overt acknowl- 
edgment be made. It was essen- 
tially a wartime symbol, intended 
for use by a spy in enemy terri-. 
tory when open communication 
could mean discovery arid rapid 
oblivion. It was quite out of place 
in an old vessel on a milk-run — 
but the experienced captain had 
put one and one together and 
come through. 

The captain named a figure for 
putting him ashore in a lifeboat. 
Dillingham agreed though the 
price seemed high. The old space 
salt led him to an airlock and in- 
stalled him in a tiny compart- 
ment. The creature saw that he 
was securely strapped down, 
punched a destination without us- 
ing the translator. So far so good 
— since no communications 
equipment had been used, the 
Jann should have no idea what 
Dillingham was doing. By the 
same token, Dillingham had no 
certain notion where the captain 
was sending him. 

The airlock closed, sealing him 
off. He felt a rough lurch as the 
lifeboat detached itself — next 
a feeling of tremendous weight as 
its antique chemical rockets blast- 
ed. He was on his way. 

Now that it was too late to 
change his mind it occurred to 
him that it would have been easy 
for the captain to route the life- 
boat into nowhere, claiming Dil- 
lingham was a suicide but still col- 
lecting the University remittance. 

NONE BUT I 



The University would automati- 
cally challenge any payment under 
suspicious circumstances. The 
captain would be well aware of 
that. Foul play would be more 
trouble than it was worth. 

Anyway, the captain had an 
honest snout. 

Dillingham did not dare to turn 
on the viewscreen to see where 
he was going, because the Jann 
could probably tap into that too. 
He had to go blind, hoping that 
he was losing the Jann as effective- 
ly as he was confusing himself. 

Time passed. He slept while 
the boat sailed on. The craft was 
in free fall now, but he was not. 
The rotating hull provided partial 
weight. He dreamed of scintil- 
lating robots. 

Braking rockets jolted him into 
uncomfortable awareness. He was 
almost there — he hoped on a 
civilized planet. Otherwise he had 
merely traded one demise for 
another. 

The landing was cruel. When 
the pressure and furor subsided 
and he regained consciousness, he 
struggled into a suit and cranked 
open the port. He still did not 
dare to use the powered equip- 
ment, for that would have re- 
quired instructions over the trans- 
lator. He was prepared to face a 
blizzard oi;- an inferno or solid 
water. 

He was disappointed. The land- 
scape was plainly Metallica. 

What had he really expected? 

47 




Obviously the spaceship had not 
gone far during the short time 
he had been aboard. Naturally the 
lifeboat, being chemically under- 
powered, had taken much longer 
to traverse the same distance. 
Probably most of its thrust had 
been used merely reversing the 
initial inertia. The closest planet 
had to be the one he had just 
left, for space was large. 

And where was the Jann now? 
By this time the repair should 
have been completed. 

He smiled. The robot would be 
on Hazard, wondering what had 
become of a certain dentist. 

He contemplated the country- 
side. This was not the same sec- 
tion of the planet where he had 
found the robot. The vegetation 
was more richly metallic, the 
flower-filaments more brilliant, 
the green-copper lichen more 
abundant. There were rust-capped 
mountains, and a valley serviced 
by a bubbling diesel-fuel stream. 
And no sign of civilization. 

In short, a wilderness area. 

All very good. The Jann would 
eventually figure out the truth and 
come jetting back to Met^lica, 
but would not find him. A planet 
was too big to search in a hurry. 
He had scrupulously operated no 
electronic equipment, so it could 
not trace him that way. 

Meanwhile, he had merely to 
avoid starvation. 

Behind him the lifeboat trans- 
lator crackled into life, though he 

4g 



had not turned it on. “None but 
I. .” 

Oh-oh. That was another talent 
he had not known about. The Jann 
could not only tap into communi- 
cations, it could operate them re- 
motely. Thus it had established 
its rapport with the lifeboat trans- 
lator and would home in on it. 

That simple. 

“How long before you get 
here?” he inquired with prickly 
resignation. The robot must have 
obtained the registry of the life- 
boat and learned the frequency of 
its translator. 

“Seventeen minutes, mortal. 
Take care that no harm comes to 
thee in the interim, for I would 
suffer sorely were mine oath 
abridged.” 

“Thine oath be damned.” Dil- 
lingham shouted, and immediately 
wondered whether he could have 
accomplished anything by threat- 
ening suicide. Probably not, since 
the robot would check it out be- 
fore indulging in other pursuits. 
Anyway, he’d haye to write out a 
Last Will & Testament 
specifying what his three wishes 
were, for the sake of the second 
oath, and the disposition of the 
wealth owing from the third oath. 
Death was all too complicated. 

IV 

S EVENTEEN minutes, already 
ticking away. Such a short 
time to hide himself in this brush,

away from the lifeboat. Unless he 
wanted to stay and face down the 
Jann . 

Useless. A machine could not 
be bluffed. On the other hand, 
if he did succeed in eluding it, 
what would be gain? A tedious 
expiration from hunger and thirst? 

Yet opposing the thing physi- 
cally was out of the question. He 
was forty-two years old and even 
in youth had never been the robust 
type. The Jann had powers beyond 
those of any man. 

His only real chance was to 
outsmart it. For all its talents, it 
did not seem particularly bright, 
or he never would have escaped 
it this long. It could easily have 
interfered with the lifeboat’s guid- 
ance system and made it crash, 
for example, had it deduced his 
whereabouts soon enough. Or 
prevented him from ever boarding 
the scow to Hazard, by fouling 
up the spaceport translators. It had 
missed marvelous opportunities. 

Also, it seemed to feel obliged 
to answer all questions put to it. 
That was another machine trait. 
Probably it was incapable of ly- 
ing, or of evading the truth, unlike 
the inferior contemporary robots. 
That could be its Achilles’ heel. 

“Why didn’t you foul up the 
spaceport’s communications net- 
work, to prevent me from leaving 
Metallica?” he asked. Might as 
well keep probing. 

“That would have interfered 
with thy freedom of motion.” 



“What do you care where I 
want to go, since you intend to 
kill me anyway?” 

“The rights of a sentient crea- 
ture may not be voided, mortal, 
unless directly contrary to a spe- 
cific Jann oath. So it is recorded, 
so must it be. Wherever thou art, 
there will I find thee and there 
will I do thee die. Then will I 
grant thee three wishes, for the 
second time thou savest me — ” 
“And then enrich me forever 
and ever, for the third time. I 
know.” 

“Then only will the oaths be 
acquitted and I free.” 

This didn’t seem to be getting 
him anywhere. He already knew 
the robot was impervious to irony 
about the feasibility of the remain- 
ing boons after the first had been 
accomplished. Probably there 
were Jann statutes to cover the 
situation even if he never men- 
tioned the oaths in his will. 

Only about ten minutes were 
left. His stomach felt like a sponge 
full of pepper-sauce and his brain 
not much better. He had a feeling 
that he would rest easier if he 
simply accepted what was to be 
but his innards would not cooper- 
ate. 

“How can I stop you from kill- 
ing me?” he blurted. 

“I cannot tell thee that, mortal, 
for it would violate the letter of 
the oath.” 

“So there is a way?” 

“I refuse to answer on the 

49

grounds that it might tend to com- 
promise mine oath, or le2id in 
some devious way to — ” 

“Oh, shut up!” Why had he 
bothered to try? And to add in- 
sult, he found the Jann’s occasion- 
al use of “mine” in place of “my” 
irritating. At least the machine 
should be consistent. 

But there was a way, he saw 
abruptly. The Jann had tried to 
evade the issue, but had bungled 
it. If only he could figure out the 
loophole, or trick the machine 
into telling him. Perhaps it even 
wanted to tell him, but was pre- 
vented by its metallic code of 
ethics. 

He needed time to think. He 
had barely five minutes left — 
but if he managed to hide, he 
might have a couple of days be- 
fore the end. Perhaps growing 
hunger would sharpen his imagin- 
ation. 

The lifeboat had a supply of 
water. Dillingham drank until he 
bulged, looked for a container to 
carry some with him and finally 
set off frustrated. No time. The 
brush was thick, away from the 
section the rockets had blasted 
clear. A number of the flower 
filaments gave off heat, which 
was another break. The Jann 
would have a tough time picking 
him out by body warmth. 

He heard a peculiar swish in 
the direction of the lifeboat and 
could not resist looking back. Sure 
enough, the Jann was coming 



down, resplendent in the sunlight. 
It was vertical, descending feet 
first, like a shining god. No jets 
were visible. 

To think that this thing had 
been built by loving mechanical 
parents before true civilization 
ever evolved on Earth. It was still 
far ahead of anything Earth sci- 
ence knew. Yet it was determined 
to kill its benefactor. 

He broke from his reverie and 
moved on, carefully and quickly 
now. He hoped the Jann was not 
equipped to sniff out his trml, like 
a bloodhound. 

He could hear it casting about 
in the wrong direction. Then it 
appeared in the sky again, swing- 
ing a pinkish beam of li^t. Dil- 
lingham ducked behind a hum- 
ming iron tree until the way was 
clear. A lightbeam that was visible 
in broad sunlight was probably 
worth avoiding. 

Suddenly he encountered an 
animal, a robot-beast, its scales 
burnished copper, its teeth stain- 
less steel, its eyes white-hot fila- 
ments. He hardly had time to 
marvel that it should so strongly 
resemble an Earthly carnivore, 
before it sprang. 

H e dodged back instinctively 
and caught hold of an alum- 
inum sapling to pull himself away. 
The creature ground gears and 
spun about as it touched ground, 
but its momentum prevented it 
from leaping again immediately.

IF 





It had . little wheels where foot- 
pads would have been in a living 
predator, and what looked like 
shock absorbers in the ankles. 

What possible use would it have 
for his ^ien flesh? But he dived 
for a larger trunk and scrambled 
up its knobby bark as the beast 
came at him. Now he regretted 
imbibing all that water, he was 
weak and heavy, and he sloshed 
inside. But the thing after him 
was, after all, an animal, and 
probably attacked anything that 
invaded its hunting ground — even 
though a single bite of Dilling- 
ham should rust its tongue rapidly. 

The jaws snapped just beneath 
him and a jet of hot air scorched 
his posterior. Air-cooling, prob- 
ably — but it w'as reminiscent of 
breath.

Wire tendrils vwfefe » drofypmg on- 
him from the tree’s tinsel foliage. 
They coiled like corkscrews, and 
a slickness glistened on their 
points. Acid, surely. 

Below, the animal Opened its 
jaws. DiUingham could see right 
down its throat. It resembled a 
sausage-grinder. 

He was trapped. The first tree- 
wire . touched his head, and he 
smelled burning hair and felt a 
sharp pain as though a magnifying 
glass were focused on that spot. 
He jerked away . toward the 
grinning beast. 

“Help!” he cried, not caring 
how inane he sounded. 

And the Jann came. 

In seconds it had whistled 
through the brush and was beside 
the tree. A lance of fire from its 
chest melted the face of the ani- 
mal. Ear-splitting sonids from its 
head caused the tree’s wires to 
retreat hastily. 

“None but I shall do thee die!” 
it bellowed. 

It reached for Dillingham. He 
closed his eyes, knowing the end 
had come. Metal pincers closed 
on his body, lifted. For a moment 
he dangled, then he felt the ground 
under his feet. The Jann let go. 

“I wish you’d get it over with,” 
Dillingham said, now oddly calm. 

“First must I grant thee one 
token boon, before I do thee die. 
Thou needs must make thy re- 
quest within fifteen seconds, ac- 
cording to Jannish custom.” It 
52 



began ticking, one tick per 
second. 

Fifteen seconds to think of the 
loophole, when he hadn’t been 
able to do it in the past day. Ten 
seconds. The Jann was aiming its 
chest-nozzle at him. Five. His 
mind was numb. 

“A postponement,” he cried. 
“Granted,” the Jann said. “How 
long?” 

Ah, foolishness. “Fifty years?” 
He waited for the derisive bolt 
of heat, but it did not come. 
“Granted, mortal.” 

Dillingham stared. “You mean 
— you’ll wait?” 

It almost seemed that the metal 
face was smiling. The mouth, was 
open, at any rate, and the frjeshly 
bridged tooth was visible. Ap- 
parently the Hazard spaceshop 
had not been able to procure a 
replacement. “Originally I con- 
templated a shorter period, but 
I perceived that this would be an 
injustice. Thou art not the fortune- 
hunter I expected, nor yet the 
fool I suspected. And we Jann 
are not unmindful of honest cour- 
tesies rendered.” 

Dillingham was abruptly ‘re- 
minded of Oyster, whose m^e of 
operation had a certain similarity 
to this. He hoped he never en- 
countered another such mind. “So 
you modified the spirit of the oath 
slightly,” he suggested, “if not the 
letter.” 

“And I could not tell thee,”

If the last man on Earth finds the last 
woman, can they sui^viye—each other? 




M utated grass rustled above 
bomb-scorched brown earth. 
Footprints faded near a crumbling 
highway at the city’s edge. At 
night the glow warned travelers 
away. By day the city’s charred 
skeleton told passersby of the 
death waiting them inside. 

A silence as vast as the sky 



filled the city’s cracking streets. 
Here a rat scurried and there a 
sparrow fluttered. The dead city 
had life but its sole human citizen 
was lonely and old. 

Canvas bag strapped over a thin 
shoulder, Justin Parker stepped 
through the grocery window, kick- 
ing aside chunks of broken plate 

53 




glass. Fine dust coated the interior. 
It formed a sJwirling cloud that 
threatened to choke him. He 
walked silently. It seemed almost 
a sin to make noise in this place. 
A rat shrilled. 

Two thin rats fought in a cor- 
ner in the sunlight. One collapsed 
as he watched. A darkness spread 
to stain the dust-thick floor. The 
victor began to gnaw its comrade. 

Justin realized bitterly that only 
the strong survived. He shook his 
head. The past, he reminded him- 
self, was dead. He lived better in 
the city than he could live outside. 
Food was always at hand. His 
grandchildren were buried here 
somewhere in the mass of rubble. 
The radiation had sterilized him 
but he was too old to care. The 
rat squeaked in pain. 

Several red ants — inch-long 
brutes — swarmed in the rat’s 
thin fur. It shrilled and slashed at 
its back. Cut in halves, one ant 
fluttered to the floor. The rat 
scurried past a counter and van- 
ished. More long ants appeared 
and scuttled toward the dead rat. 
They began to strip off its flesh. 

Justin felt mild amazement. 
Those ants were abnormal. Dried 
bones crunched under his thin 
tennis shoes as he walked to a 
counter. He lifted a sun-blanched 
can, blew off dust. The city’s crea- 
tures were starving with food all 
around them. But he was a man 
and he could open the cans. Food 
and lonely silence filled the dead 



city. He turned the can thought- 
fully. The veins showed blue 
through the weathered skin on the 
back of his hand. 

“Peas,” he murmured, reading 
the faded label. Age had not yet 
destroyed his eyesight. After fill- 
ing his canvas bag with various 
cans he looked behind the register 
for ammunition. Currently he pos- 
sessed only three bullets for his 
stub-nosed .38. 

He found no replacements. The 
department stores would furnish 
him with weapons and ammo. 
The sun was in mid-morning and 
he had the rest of the day for 
exploration and salvage on NW 
13 Street. This grocery was his 
first building — there were count- 
less others. 

He left as he had come, through' 
the window. The street was ugly 
with blasted warehouses and twist- 
ed service stations. He was sev- 
eral hours away from the home 
he had made in the basement of 
a branch public library. 

Something crawled up his leg. 

Whipping out his hunting knife, 
he slashed. A red ant dropped to 
the pavement, abdomen ripped. 
Regaining its feet, it scurried 
back toward him. He ground it 
beneath his tennis shoe, and the 
chitin snapped. Sheathing his 
knife, he looked about. 

S EVERAL small groups of five 
or seven red ants scurried up 
the street, now and then skirting 

IF 



54 




a rain hole in the pavement. Puz- 
zled, he frowned. 

Ants did not normally travel in 
groups like that. In fact, they all 
should have starved. There was 
not enough unpackaged food in 
the huge dead city to support 
even three antbeds, much less beds 
as many as theirs would have to 
be. He gazed idly down the street. 

It flowed red with a carpet of 
the overgrown ants. The swarm- 
ing mass was less than a block 
away. They were looking for food, 
too, and — he grinned — with 
that formation they were bound to 
find some, at least a rat or two. 

They were no real bother, he 
decided, but he could not stay on 
that street. Shrugging, he crossed 
it slowly and headed for the next 
one over — NW 12. This carried 
him farther toward the center of 
the city and farther from his home 
but that would not matter. 

Those — he grinned wryly — 
sure had been a lot of ants. He 
had not realized the city held so 
many. He came to a comer, 
stepped into the street and glanced 
down it. 

More ants. This time he frown- 
ed. This carpet of aiits was closer 
than the one behind him — about 
three-fourths of a block away. 

“Damn them,” he murmured 
mildly. 

They were disrupting his 
schedule. He had set aside this 
day for the exploration and sal- 
vage of NW 13 th Street. Thirteen 

SURVIVAL 



— this was his unlucky day. But 
as soon as the ants passed he 
could resume his sch^uled ex- 
ploration. He crossed over to NW 
11 . 

“Damn,” he murmured. 

The swarming carpet was still 
there. This group, though, was 
barely more than a half block 
away. Ants three blocks wide. He 
shook his head — that was too 
many ants. His canvas bag grew 
heavy. Easing its rope to a less 
tender spot on his left shoulder, 
he crossed over to NW 10th. 

Ants. The carpet was there, too 

— and even closer. He glared at 
the swarming mass. This had 
ceased to be a joke. Irritated, he 
glanced aroimd. Home was far 
behind — toward the dead zone 

— and he still needed more ammo. 
Since his fight with a dog pack 
he had only a box of shotgun 
shells left. But certainly with the 
ants spread out all over, he could 
not look for any. Pain burned his 
right leg. 

He slapped. An ant crunched 
beneath his fingers. Several others 
scurried at his feet. He squashed 
them, mbbing at the burning 
lump. 

He eyed the flowing red sea 
up the street. He estimated more 
than a million — more than a 
billion. The canvas bag slid down 
a bit. He eased it back up on his 
left shoulder. Like him, the ants 
were searching for food. The sting 
hurt. He scratched it again. 

55 




“Damn beggar,” he grumbled 
softly. 

Warily he watched the scurry- 
ing sea. 

It came at a good rate, he real- 
ized suddenly. Almost too fast. 
But the ants were too slow to out- 
race a human, he knew. He cross- 
ed over to NW 9th Street, grin- 
ning again. 

The ants there were a quarter 
block away. He frowned. His heart 
began to leap and he felt the 
first tuggings of a worry he dared 
not face. Quickly he strode to 
NW 8. 

The red sea was scant feet 
away. He swallowed grimly. The 
mass had to have an ending — it 
could not go on forever. Several 
ants crawled on his tennis shoes. 
Stomping them off, he trotted 
briskly toward NW 7. 

The ants were flowing past it. 
He froze, staring in dismay. NW 
6, 5, 4 — all flowed red. 

Trapped. 

He whirled. 

The red sea flowed slowly into 
the intersection of NW 8. He had 
to get home. He ran to NW 8, 
skirted the forward ranks and 
raced on to NW 9. 

The ant carpet filled that inter- 
section, but he smashed through, 
running to NW 10. He was two 
hours away from home — maybe 
too far. 

NW 10 was blocked — as were 
NW 10, 11, 12. The red sea 
now milled about his feet but he 



stomped hard and the ants could 
not climb up his tennis shoes. He 
raced up NW 10 and passed the 
sea within a block. He slowed. 

H e could not stop. But the 
ants were no r^ danger. 
He could outrun them and they 
could not catch him even if he 
walked. All he had to do was 
keep ahead of them. In fact, he 
realized, whenever he wanted to 
he could even dart into a building 
and they would never find him. 

Walking easily backward and 
panting some to catch his breath, 
he watched the slow, ponderous 
advance. The ants, he noticed un- 
easily, were entering the buildings, 
scurrying under doors or up walls 
to drop through the broken win- 
dows. Maybe they even went up- 
stairs — their negligible weight 
made their going into buildings 
not dangerous. The twenty-mega- 
ton blast that had left a two-mile 
crater where an underground mis- 
sile base had been had also dam- 
aged the above-ground floors of 
many buildings northwest of 4th 
Street. Justin wore scars from one 
bad fall. 

The ants came faster than he 
had thought they could. Turning, 
he hurried past several warehouses 
and a small grocery. The sun had 
baked large cracks into the pave- 
ment and the rains had worn out 
large holes. There was no street 
repair crew to care for the city 
but there were no people to use 



56 



IF 




the streets either. He turned again, 
walking slowly backward in order 
to watch the ants. They fascinated 
him. 

The advance guard came to the 
holes and skirted them. The for- 
ward ranks tried to climb down, 
fell, climbed out, resumed their 
slow march forward. Later ar- 
rivals — the masses — tumbled in 
and could not make it out. Slowly 
the holes filled with struggling 
ants — they formed a living pa- 
vement for the ones in back. He 
shook his head at the fascinating 
sight. Suddenly the pavement 
crumbled beneath him. 

He fell, his back slamming the 
street. The canvas bag of cans 
smashed into his left side, crash- 
ing the pocketed stub-nosed re- 
volver into his thigh. He groaned, 
blinking at the morning sun. 

Rame seared his legs. He 
stared, blinking away pain tears. 
His feet and part of his legs were 
sinking into the red sea. 

He cried out in stunned horror. 
Hurtling to his feet, he stamped 
the pavement so hard his soles 
hurt. Frantically he beat at the 
ants. Some fell, others clung, 
stinging his hands. The red sea 
reached him and flowed past. 

He ran. Warehouses flashed 
by. Ants clung to his thin, hair- 
less legs — biting, stinging, sting- 
ing, stinging. 

He spotted a deep hole, in the 
sidewalk filled with clear water. 
He almost stopped but there was 

SURVIVAL 



mud at the bottom. Mud nieant 
settled, radioactive particles and 
these could enter the cuts in his 
skin. 

At the next comer, beside a 
three-story GE warehouse, sat a 
small Gulf station with two pumps. 

Gasoline, ... 

He ran to the nearest pump. 
The rubberized plastic hose had 
cracked but it was not brittle. 
Twisting everything that could be 
twisted, he pounded here and 
there. Suddenly gasoline sprayed 
out of the nozzle and out of twen- 
ty places on the hose. Time had 
built up a great deal of pressure in 
the storage tank. He sprayed the 
gas over his legs and the cuts 
burned worse. But the ants died. 

Shutting off the hose, he drop- 
ped it. His canvas bag fell and he 
sank to the concrete beside it. 
His heart raced to catch up with 
the old body’s demands. His back 
felt wrenched. He pulled up his 
tom pants and picked off the dead 
ants. His legs were red and 
swollen. He knew the poison had 
given him a fever. His left thigh 
ached badly and both elbows bled. 
He could not go on much farther, 
he realized, and glanced back. 

T he red sea swarmed five 
blocks away. Was that as 
far as he had run? He swallowed 
his pain. He might die hideously 
unless he found safety. The Gulf 
Station was a small building with 
a flat gravel roof — but the ants 

57 




could climb its walls and the roof 
would offer no safety. 

He closed his eyes. 

Please, God, Let me think. 

Opening his eyes, he gazed at 
his thin hands, spotted brown with 
age. Perhaps he had lived long 
enough. 

He laughed sardonically and 
rose. No man lived long enough. 
He gazed around. 

He saw two gasoline punips, a 
large rack of rusting oil cans be- 
tween them. The gas could kill 
the ants but how long would the 
tank’s contents last? He had no 
idea. 

The buildings were not safe. 
Shock, time and weather had 
weakened them. His glance fell 
again to the rack of rusting oil 
cans. 

What if 

He shot to his feet. What if the 
oil could keep the ants off? He 
could not pour it on himself — ^but 
what if he coated the eaves? 

He found an aluminum ladder, 
under a rotting tarp. It was sturdy. 
He put it against the eaves and 
climbed to the roof. The gravel 
was dirty but the footing was 
solid. 

He took his canvas bag and all 
the oil cans he could carry to the 
roof. The top cans on the rack 
had rusted through and broke 
when he pried them free but the 
other cans were good. He pulled 
the ladder up after him, gazed 
down at the ants. They were less 



than a block away. He ran a 
dirty hand through his thin white 
hair, grinned at the swarming red 
mass. 

“Try and get me now,” he chal- 
lenged, chuckling. 

He punched two holes into one 
of the cans, walked to the edge of 
the roof and started coating the 
eaves. 

Here and there he poured too 
heavily and some dripped to the 
concrete below. The job took 
three cans. He tossed the empties 
into the street. 

The red advance guard was 
racing across the pavement. A 
group of five reached the station 
wall and began to climb it. They 
recoiled from the oil. 

The front ranks reached the gas 
pumps. They skirted the gas pud- 
dle where he had hosed off his 
legs and went on. Later ranks 
tried to avoid the puddle but some 
were pushed into it. More and 
more fell in to struggle and die. 
The gasoline puddle vanished. The 
twin pumps slowly developed a 
flowing red coat. TTie oil cans in 
the street 5sank beneath the surg- 
ing sea. 

Three sides of the station flowed 
with ants. Some pushed their way 
into the oil, struggled and slowly 
drowned. Ottiers crawled over the 
dying bodies and forced their way 
up higher. Tlie red slashes thick- 
ened as the ants fought to reach 
the roof. Suddenly they slid. The 
oil oozed from the eaves, carrying 

IF 



58 




the ants with it. The mess splat- 
tered to the concrete below. 

Justin went over his defenses 
again, reenforcing the places where 
the oil had grown too thin. The 
last wall became spotted with in- 
quisitive members of the red 
army. 

WOMAN screamed. 

Startled, he looked around. 
Again he heard the scream. 

“Here!” he shouted. 

The next screams neared. He 
saw her a block down NW 1 0. 

He yelled, waving. She saw him, 
ran forward. She was blond. Her 
legs were covered with ants. A 
pouch slapped at her side. When 
she was close enough, he dropped 
the ladder. Ants began scurrying 
up it. She fell! 

She screamed, staggered to her 
feet, beating at her left side. It 
swarmed with red ants. He gazed 
in stunned horror. 

The gasoline, . 

He hurried down the ladder, 
scrambled to a pump. 

“Qose your eyes,” he yelled, 
slapping the ants off the pump and 
turning the handle. 

His legs were on fire again — 
the ants had reached him. 
Gasoline sprayed out *the nozzle. 
He hosed his legs, then turned it 
on her. She groaned at the added 
pain of the gas. Hosing a path for 
both of them to the ladder, he 
dropped the nozzle. The gas 
spewed, then suddenly dropped 

SURVIVAL 



to a thin trickle. The tank was 
spent* 

“Get to the roof — ” 

She nodded and staggered to 
the ladder. Racing forward, he 
helped her climb. She was light. 
Her hair was long, sun-blanched. 
Pulling up the ladder, he coolly 
crushed the ants that clung to it. 
Using his knife, he opened another 
quart of oil and went over the 
defenses again. The woman sat 
beside the cans, rubbing her 
swollen legs. 

“I’m Justin — ah — ” He 
frowned, trying to remember. How 
many times had he recently 
thought of his name? “Oh — Par- 
ker. Justin Parker.” He grinned at 
her. “Almost forgot it there.” 

She did not smile. 

Someone had used a knife on 
her face and the scars had never 
left. Pocks covered the remain- 
ing areas. Her hard gray eyes 
watched him. Below them her 
mouth was steel cold. Her brown 
skin pouch, purse he supposed, 
rested at her side. 

“Sorry about those ants,” he 
said, walking over to her. “The 
stings must hurt.” 

He kneeled beside her. His own 
legs ached so he could scarcely 
keep from screaming. 

“No.” Her voice was a loud 
monotone — flat, even ugly. “I 
ignore the pain. The bites do not 
hurt me as they do you.” 

He grinned. 

“I should not.” 

59 





Her gray eyes watched him 
steadily euid she did not smile. 

“Men cannot take pain. I am 
a woman and I can.” Her voice 
held the faintest traces of pride. 
“I’m surprised you’re not lying 
on the ground, yelling.” 

“I’d sure enough like to,” he 
replied with a smile. 

Rising, he took another can and 
went back to the eaves. The ants 
would be on the roof if he ignored 
the defense. 

“I’m surprised there are any 
men here,” she stated in her un- 
emotional monotone. “The ones 
who were chasing me stopped at 
the city’s edge.” 

“You’re lucky you got away 
from them,” he said politely. 

The streetside wall had the 
thickest coating of ants. In two 
places they almost came to the 
roof. 

“It was not luck,” she replied. 
“I’m braver and stronger — men 
are weak fools.” 

“I guess so,” he said easily, 
splashing oil on the two dangerous 
spots. 

“It is true,” she stated. “At one 
time I had five of you for slaves 
but one escaped. I had to kill 
him.” 

“Where are they now?” he 
asked in curiosity. 

He could not believe life out- 
side had become that hard. Slav- 
ery? 

“They died,” she said calmly. 
“Their hearts were not strong and 



they lost too much blood when I 
beat them. Then a gang took me 
and I escaped. That is why I am 
here.” Her voice held no emotion 
at all — she was merely telling 
facts. “I would not have their 
babies. I’m not a mother.” 

“Can’t blame you,” he replied. 
Below, the ants were avoiding the 
gasoline pools on the concrete. 
“Well,” he cried in mild suprise. 
“Look there!” 

T he ants carried tiny bundles 
wrapped in fragments of 
grocery bags. Here and there he 
spotted the winged back of a 
young king or queen. The woman 
stepped up to him. 

“So?” 

Her monotone sounded disgust- 
ed. He glanced up. Her face 
seemed dead under her gently wav- 
ing blond hair. 

“They’re carrying bundles,” he 
explained. She turned and walked 
back to the pile of cans and sat 
down. “It’s a discovery,” he added. 
“Like when we discovered fire.” 
“Oh? Where do you live?” 

Her voice held no interest. 
“NW Fifty-eighth Street and 
Thomas Avenue,” he replied. “In 
the dead zone.” He grinned. “Got 
a nice place there. Basement of 
a — ” 

“Oh?” Her rocky eyes watched 
him. “How did you survive so 
long?” 

Shrugging, he poured out the 
last of the oil, tossed the can to 

IF

the street. The swirling red sea 
covered it instantly. 

“I managed,” he said. Running 
his left hand through his thin 
white hair, he touched the bullet 
scar hidden there. “Lucky, I 
guess.” She disdained making any 
rejoinder. “Hey,” he '’aid in as- 
tonishment. “Look at that, will 
you?” 

He kneeled at the edge of the 
roof. 

The red ants had passed. Be- 
hind them came a flowing, swirl- 
ing sea of black ones. Several 
yards separated the two armies 
and, as he watched, the black ad- 
vance guard went too far and 
brushed against the red rear guard. 
The reds attacked and the blacks 
fell back. Even hungry, the two 
were enemies. He shook his head. 

“Sort of reminds you of the 
War, doesn’t it?” he said, glancing 
back. 

Her right hand rested in her 
pouch. 

“I don’t think you’re fit,” she 
stated. Her voice seemed as dry 
and cold as ever. “Only the 
strongest can survive. You’re not 
strong. You are too old, too thin. 
You are not fit. You cannot sur- 
vive. I do not know how you sur- 
vived so far.” 

He shrugged. 

“It doesn’t take muscle to sur- 
vive here,” he replied. Something 
in her voice sounded dangerous. 
She faced his right side but, from 
where he knelt, she could not see 

SURVIVAL 



his left. Slowly he reached into 
his left pocket and grasped the 
worn handle of his revolver. 
“You’ve survived,” he added to 
keep her talking. “So you must 
know that.” 

Easing the .38 out of the leather 
lining of his pocket, he lowered 
it to the gravel by his feet. She 
frowned and he froze. 

“You’re right,” she stated emo- 
tionlessly. He relaxed. She was 
worried about his words, not his 
actions. “I’m not tremendously 
strong but I have great powers of 
endurance.” She touched a swell- 
ing on her left cheek. “I can stand 
the pain of this ant bite. No man 
can endure what a woman can.” 
Her right hand came out of her 
pouch. It held a .22 revolver. “A 
man’s only purpose is to be a 
slave and do heavy work — but 
you are unfit.” She raised her re- 
volver. “I shall kill you,” she 
stated in her emotionless mono- 
tone. 

H IS .38 rested easily in his 
hand. He smiled at her. 
“Please don’t,” he said. The re- 
volver remained level. “You will 
be alone if you kill me,” he 
added. 

He did not want to kill her. 
The War had caused enough 
death. 

“No,” she replied in her mono- 
tone. “I will find 'another man to 
get my food. You’re too weak. I 
cannot use you.” 

61 




“What’s your name?” he asked 
suddenly. 

“Edith — ” she broke off. 
“That’s not your business.” 

He cx)uld detect a bit of irrita- 
tion. 

“Edith what?” 

He watched her. She could fire 
whenever she decided to. But 
more killing was not needed. 
Death was not a way of life. 

“Edith — Randal,” she replied. 

Her voice held a bit of pride. 
Pride? Was pride her weakness? 

“Edith,” he repeated and 
smiled. “You know, that’s Ger- 
man for ‘rich-war.’ ’’ 

“Oh?” 

Suddenly her gray eyes seemed 
to light. The revolver began to 
sag in her slender hand. 

“Yes,” he said. “And Randal 
is — let’s see.” He paused and she 
leaned forward slightly. The re- 
volver sagged a fraction more and 
he gathered his legs for a leap. 
“Oh, yes. That’s Anglo-Saxon for 
‘shield-wolf.’ ” He grinned dis- 
alarmingly. “ ‘Rich-war, shield- 
wolf.’ You have a very strong 
name.” He nodded his approval 
and her head bobbed slightly in 
acknowledgment. “You should be 
proud of a name like that.” 

Her lips twitched. She looked 
like a snake trying to smile. Her 
attention was completely on him. 

It was time. 

Suddenly widening his eyes he 
started, staring past her. 

“Behind you,” he shouted. 



She whirled, firing at the empty 
air. 

Dropping his revolver, he leap- 
ed. He hit and roUed, turning her 
under him. She shrieked and 
scratched at his face. He tore the 
.22 free and hurled it to the street. 
She squirmed in the gravel, trying 
to bite him. He grabbed her hair. 

She growled like an animal. Her 
fingernails slashed his cheeks. He 
caught her hands, sat on her belly 
and waited. 

She tried to knee him. He 
bounced once. She gasped for air 
and lay still. He waited, but she 
did not struggle. Her stony eyes 
glared at him. 

“Go ahead, man,” she said 
without any emotion. “Take me.” 

He grinned in amusement. 

“I’ll take you home,” he amend- 
ed, slowly easing off her. She did 
not fight but seemed willing to 
lie quietly. “I have some medi- 
cine there that’ll take care of those 
ant stings.” He smiled warmly. 
“You’ll feel like a new woman.” 

Her eyes gave no sign of any 
emotion. He stood up. She did 
not move. 

“You’ll really like the home,” 
he added, walking back for his 
.38. “I’ve got the finest bed there 
I could find in this whole city — 
but that’ll be yours.” He picked 
it up. “Along with the whole 
room.” He turned. “How — ” 

She held his hunting knife. Her 
hand was back to throw it. 

He shouted and hurtled to one 

IF 



62 




side. He fell, rolled, stopped, re- 
volver waist-high and ready. She 
had not thrown. Suddenly she 
smiled. 

“Man, you die!” 

He fired. 

One shot was all it took. Rising, 
he picked up his knife and slid it 
back into its scabbard. Slipping 
his revolver back into his left 
pocket, he looked down. A few 
feet from her body lay a small 
splatter of brains and blond hair 
from his bullet’s exit Slowly he 
kneeled beside her. 

She was the third human he 
had killed. The act was always 
pointless. The War was pointless 
— and so were the actions of the 
ants below. He crossed her thin 
arms over her chest. 

“Forgive her, God,” he mur- 
mured softly. 

B elow, the black ants were 
carrying little bundles wrap- 
ped in brown paper, just as the 
red ants had done earlier. He 
kneeled at the edge of the roof 
and looked down. What, he won- 
dered, could those bundles be? 
Intermixed with the package car- 
riers were the young king and 
queen ants. 

King and queen? Male and fe- 
male. 

Those bimdles held eggs — 
protected from the sun. 

“I’ll be damned,” he murmured 
in* pleasure. 

The ants were learning The 
SURVIVAL 



black ants passed and behind them 
came small jelly-brown ones. 

The brown ants’ advance guard 
touched the rear guard of the 
black army. No — he looked 
closer. It did not just touch. Ther 
small brown ants mixed with the 
black ones — and they were not 
fighting. For the briefest of in- 
stants he closed his eyes. 

“Thank you, God,” he whis- 
pered. 

He sat down beside his canvas 
bag and »watched the passing 
brown sea. They were hungry. He 
touched the canvas bag. They 
were hungry in a city of food. 

He pulled out a can of. peas, 
looked at it and at his old, thin 
hand. They were hungry. He hurl- 
ed the can into the street below. 
It broke and the peas and juice 
spread out into a pool. The brown 
specks swarmed over it. He hurled 
another, then another. When the 
brown sea had passed the cans 
were bare. 

Rubbing his aching legs, he 
stared at the empty street. What, 
he wondered, would they dis- 
cover next? The wheel? Fire? 

Lowering the ladder, he slung 
his empty canvas bag over his 
thin shoulder and descended. The> 
sun showed late afternoon. He had 
wasted the day. He shrugged. To- 
morrow would be another. Resting 
a hand on a gas pump, he glanced 
back at the Gulf station roof. 

Another very lonely day. 

He walked home. •

C RAWFURD Null positioned 
the bus in the light wind, 
dropped the stabilizing bars be- 
tween rows, set a slight negative 
buoyancy and drilled the hole 
neck deep. He climbed into the 
plastic sack and held it up with 



one hand while he hooked his arm 
over the boom bar. Ed Deasy took 
the controls and lowered him into 
the hole. Jane Clapperton held the 
sack around his neck and released 
the expanded mica that buried 
him in the row of brabbage. They 
had used sand at first instead of 
mica, but the sand compacted too 



64 



much. She then looked at Niall 
doubtfully, released the delivery 
tube to suck itself back into the 
bus and smoothed the mica 
around his head. 

It was a dramatic and effective 
demonstration of what the picker 
could do— a human head in a 
row of brabbage heads. Theoreti- 
cally at least, the picker would 
recognize it and pass, not harm- 
ing it. Niall grinned at the farm- 
ers in front of him and twisted 
his neck to watch Jane walk down 
the row to the harvester. Ed 
Deasy lifted the bus and let it 
drift with the wind before he 
swung it around the spectators 
and set it down behind them. 

The city manager of Hydspe 
squatted down beside Niall. 

“How’s that foxy bastard, Billy 
Ballod, these days?” he asked. 

“No change. Full of hell. What 
I want to know is why does my 
nose start itching as soon as I get 
buried?” 

The city manager rubbed it 
with the back of his hand and 
said, “Have you signed a new 
contract yet?” I’m not tampering, 
Niall, but if you haven’t, let us 
put in a bid. I know your time 
is up tomorrow and there’s no 
renewal option. We don’t expect 
anything like brabbage, of course, 
but we like your team well enough 
to make a very attractive offer.” 

“Oh, I don’t know,” said Niall. 
“There are a couple of interesting 
crops we haven’t had time to in- 

DOWN ON THE FARM 



troduce at Avelou. But the three 
of us figure to go off planet and 
maybe back to College Station 
before we go out for bid again. 
We saved a little money on this 
contract.” 

“I heard you weren’t entirely 
broke. You think about it. You 
let us know.” He rubbed Niall’s 
nose again before he stepped back 
with his farmers. 

t Ct adies and gentlemen,” said 
L/ Niall, looking up at them 
from the ground, “this particular 
field is Avelou seventy-seventy-two 
brabbage, developed by Jane 
Clapperton for machine harvest- 
ing. It allows a plant population 
of up to fifty-one thousand heads 
per hectare. You and I know how 
good Weather Control is, how you 
stagger planting for a three-month 
harvest and get jammed into a 
two-month period. This is part of 
why brabbage has been so expen- 
sive. And in the state of the art, 
every city on the planet — except 
Avelou — wisely demands a catch 
fence to keep the brabbage where 
it belongs. Since brabbage must be 
planted on new ground for opti- 
mum results, it’s not cheap.” 
“You can rotate back every 
five years,” said a farmer. 

“So you build and maintain five 
fences instead of none,” said 
Niall. He had an itch above his 
right ear. The whole demonstra- 
tion could have been taped but 
even a three-sixty-degree projec- 



65 




tion had nowhere near the impact 
of the real thing out in the valley, 
downwind of Hydspe, with the 
tall mesh fences cutting the sky. 
“With the seventy-seventy-two and 
the harvester,” Niall continued, 
“you can plant fifteen hectares for 
every harvester you own. In the 
open. This allows one hundred 
per cent safety margin before bolt- 
ing. Avelou will bond you against 
any damage on the basis of the 
harvester recorder.” 

The city manager quoted the 
truism: “Machines are made by 
men.” 

“The bond holds. We have a 
ten-hour repair service to any 
growing area on Nicosea. If it’s 
a major breakdown we bring a 
new machine to finish the job. 
The price of the rig includes a 
warranty — also recorded at the 
Central Bank — and a repair 
inspection and certification by us 
during the off season.” 

“Will you sell the seed sepa- 
rately?” 

Niall grinned. “You bet we will. 
But if you plan on machine har- 
vest, just as a friendly suggestion, 
make damn sure you have some- 
body like Ed Deasy design your 
machine. The programing gets 
a little complex. Did you hear 
about those greedy people over at 
Drahnko seventy years ago? No 
fences, late rain, warm weather. 
The brabbage berfted. Women and 
children moved into the city hall 
and they cleaned the fSters every 



hour on the hour. Every man was 
outside in protective gear with 
a flamethrower for six weeks. You 
can’t trust brabbage.” Niall 
paused. “Other questions? All 
right, Jane, let her roll.” The 
great red harvester with Avelou’s 
gold circle A on the nose started 
down the row. 

One of the farmers asked, “Are 
you positive this thing works?” 

Niall grinned. “To tell you the 
whole truth, sometimes I wake 
up in the middle of the night to 
make sure my head is on straight.” 

The farmers laughed. They 
were a little apprehensive. This 
was one demonstration that really 
held their interest. 

“There are four tests for every 
head, just as you pick it yourself: 
color, conformity, solidity and 
scent. My head’s the wrong color; 
it’s irregular, far too solid and no 
one ever said I smell as nice as 
a ripe brabbage.” Another nerv- 
ous laugh from the spectators. 
“This is about our thirty-fifth 
demonstration. So far I’ve got the 
same old head.” 



B rabbage is a plant native to 
Nicosea and is as interesting 
to most human beings as catnip 
to most cats. It is remarkable for 
its catholic intake of trace ele- 
ments, including copper, iodine, 
iron, manganese, zinc, molybde- 
rum, cobalt and selenium, with an 
inhibitory system that limits the 

IF 



66 




intake below human toxicity levels 
in even mineral-rich soils. It con- 
tains vitamins A, D, E, K and 
all of the B complex. Ascorbic 
acid is adequate at harvest but is 
lost rapidly in storage. It is low 
in fats, high in carbohydrates. 
It is an indicator of lithium in its 
native condition — and while it 
grows well in spodumene, lep- 
iodolite or tetalite, it reaches op- 
timum size in amblygonite. The 
period of maturity is brief and 
varies remarkably with the 
individual plant, with seed, soil, 
weather and microecological con- 
belfore maturity, it is slimy. If it 
bolts, it is actively dangerous. 

Because of the high solids con- 
tent, the tissue-thin leaves do not 
shrink a great deal when dry and 
the rate of decay is slow. Ten- 
meter drifts of brabbage leaves 
have been reported on Jalka Is- 
land. The island has never been 
settled. The leaves barbelate when 
dry and fragment as they are spun 
by the wind. In addition, there are 
three to five hook-shaped seeds 
on the edge of each leaf, and while 
the toxin they contain at bolting 
is not excessively virulent, many 
a man has died from a thousand 
needle-hook seeds in his exposed 
skin. 

But in the short period, of full 
maturity between slime and bolt- 
ing, it is the most attractive 
vegetable food known to man. 

“That rig is picking every 
head,” said a farmer. 

DOWN ON THE FARM 



“It’s taking every head,” 
shouted Jane Clapperton. “Craw- 
furd, the odds aren’t that good!” 

“It’s the seventy-seventy-two 
strain,” Niall reassured them all. 
“Did I tell you that the seventy- 
seventy-two hold for up to fifteen 
weeks in C/A storage?” The 
temperature should be be- 
tween — ” 

“I can’t stop it!” Jane was 
struggling with the manual over- 
ride. “Ed! Ed! Master control!” 

Deasy sprinted wildly for the 
back of the bus, leaping over 
amblygonite containers, shovels, 
seed vacuums, a dusting skip, the 
concentrate spray rig and all the 
other deck paraphernalia. 

“Box is ginunicked! Won’t turn 
off!” 

Niall had a glimpse of Jane 
tearing at the controls cover be- 
fore the positioning wings shut off 
the world. The color-sensing cir- 
cuit passed, the conformity fingers 
brushed him gently and the amy- 
lester analyzer sniffed. The whin- 
ing saw bar swung down. 

The great red harvester moved 
on. 

“Deary — medeary — medeary,” 
babbled a husky farmer. Jane tore 
out the micrommiaturized com- 
puter and the machine stopped. 
The men swarmed around the 
harvester and onto it. With set 
jaw and a white face she tripped 
the toggle that opened the hopper. 
The harvested heads lay in 
cradled rows. 



67 




Brabbage is tender at maturity 
and the market value is deter- 
mined to a degree by the amount 
of bruising. Bruises make for off- 
flavor and go deep. The stem is 
fibrous and is covered with an 
extremely hard dermal layer. 

Hand harvesting is done by two 
men, one with a power saw and 
the other holding the head. 

The brabbage in the hopper 
was clean cut and unbruised. 
There was a wasp-buzz of horror 
and one of the women bit off a 
shriek. Ed Deasy was beside Jane 
now, and he slowly reached into 
the hopper and pushed the local 
control knob that activated the 
elevators. 

There was dead silence as the 
machinery brought up and cradled 
the last picked heads.

E rasmus Ballod stood at a 
window overlooking Avelou 
and said mournfully, “How can 
they do this to me? I treat them 
like two sons and a daughter and 
this is the thanks I get.” His 
shoulders slumped in self-pity. 

Aside from the central service 
core, the mayor’s quarters were 
open. His greatest pleasure was 
to look out over his city. He had 
commissioned sixty-four peegee 
units at College Station after find- 
ing and looting an undiscovered 
outrider planet. He had acquired 
Avelou and rebuilt the city on the 

68 



hills above the bay with a per- 
manent gravity unit under each 
building. It was quite economical. 
Just drill a hole, drop in a unit 
and layer your offices or apart- 
ments above it. 

The buildings stuck out in all 
directions, each one vertical to 
the people inside, with the rest of 
Nicosea tilted. Avelou was unique 
in the Comity of Worlds. City 
planners and architectural critics 
applauded or deplored it about 
equally. City hall alone was ver- 
tical to the horizon and Ballod 
lived on the top floor. He was 
amused by the critics and the 
birds, who took careless liberties 
with other cities but became flum- 
moxed in the gravitic fields above 
Avelou. A fish-eating neagle 
lurched by with comical screams 
of outrage. Ballod ignored him. 

“I don’t expect gratitude,” he 
whined. “Just a little kindliness, a 
little consideration. Is that too 
much to ask?” 

The chief justice yawned and 
tapped his mouth with two 
fingers. Then he put his fingertips 
together and coughed a dry, legal 
cough. He was tired of Ballod’s 
feeling sorry for himself and the 
mavor reacted predictably. 

“God damn your bones.” This 
was Bully Ballod. “Where the hell 
were you when I signed that con- 
tract?” 

“I was right there, advising you 
to omit that paragraph. And you 
know it.”

i Bailed snarled and turned to 
he window again. The morning 
lun sparkled on the bay. The 
I'-ainers were at work in the new 
olphin pens. The Marina had 
ighty-eight per cent occupancy. 
1 }ardcners were landscaping the 
leasure Cube. To the south was 
i he Space Airport with Ballod’s 
vn deep-space Little Sister 
•oming dull bronze among the 
] -rightly colored pleasure craft, 
i ^Jorth and south and running to 
j he mountains were the slowly

itable, dangerous brabbage. 

“But who - would believe that 
en per cent of the net profits at 
he end of a five-year contract 
■'^/OLild figure out to a million man 
;ours? One million sweats. And 
hose sneaky agricultural bas- 
iards started from scratch.” 

“How much did they earn for 
iVelou?” 

“I hit those damn farmers 
vith every expense I can think 
f with the wage-health- 
n s u r a n ce-cducation-vacation- 
ctirement package, computer

ciital, city services and machine- 
hop depreciation. If we had mice, 
’d charge for wear and tear on 
■aps.” Bailed sighed. “And now 
ve got to pay off a million man 
ours tomorrow. Come or, now,” 
e wheedled, “Tell me how not to 
ay them. How do I get out ot 
lis? That’s what I want to know.”

4 4Tf you default payment.” 
Xsaid the chief justice, “the 
judgment in their favor will take 
four days. The Central Bank will 
honor the obligation and seize the 
city. Nicosea was discovered and 
divided some one-hundred-fifty- 
six years ago by a consortoriiim 
newly organized by the shrewdest 
busine-<s attorneys from eight 
c o mmcrcially oriented planets. 
The law is explicit. There are no 
loopholes.” 

“All right,” said Ballod, “go 
on.” 

The chief justice ticked off the 
points on his fingers. “One. Of- 
fer a cash sum and payments 
with attractive interest.” 

“They want off planet, out of 
the credit union.” 

“Two. An enticing contract for 
another year.” 

“How do you entice somebody 
you owe MH-1 million?” 

“Three. Borrow the money.” 
“There are other obligations. If 
you ask how much it costs to 
build a city, you can’t afford it. 
Racing dolphins come high, and 
that’s the only Pleasure Cube in 
two- hundred-thirty-five or so 
liaht-ycars. And the Marina and 
those damned expensive enter- 
tainers and hell, there's no end.” 
“Four. Pay off in stock.” 
Ballod waited. He had spent 
five years looting a primitive plan- 
et. He had worked with the na- 
tives, married three women, run 
his own drilling rigs and stored 



69 



his loot until it was no longer 
possible to hide his depredations 
and the peculations of the men 
he subverted. When necessary, he 
had an inexhaustible patience. 

He had put the experience of 
a lifetime, his luck and all his 
loot into Avelou. It was the pleas- 
ure capital of a world. The profits 
were enormous even now and he 
had plowed them back into de- 
velopment. The Pleasure Cube 
was his last major investment and 
the sweats would become a flood. 
Given even a year, a million man 
hours would be small change. 

“Five. Sell out.” 

A forced sale would not re- 
turn ten minutes on the hour. 

“Six. Abrogate all contracts. 
Liquidate everything. Steal what’s 
loose and take off in that superhot 
combination freighter, null-time 
cathouse, battleship and yacht 
you keep over in the port eating 
its head off.” 

Ballod grinned. “The girls have 
been out of there for the past two 
years. Fuel doesn’t deteriorate and 
the stores are good for another 
ten years. Did I ever tell you 
about that double-jointed redhead 
from Mier with the blond lanuga 
hair? Forget it. Sister costs noth- 
ing on standby.” 

“It’s a nonproductive invest- 
ment.” 

“Point of view. My pleasure. 
Conspicuous consumption. Tin 
sentimental,” said Ballod with a 
wolfish smile. “What else?” 



The chief justice fixed the mas- 
ter of Avelou with a cold legal 
eye. 

“Seven. Shoot yourself.” 

Ballod laughed. His hot blue 
eyes crinkled and his ruddy com- 
plexion flushed. He bellowed with 
amusement. The chief justice’s 
thin lips split in an unconscious 
smile of great charm. Years ago 
and parsecs away he had come 
close to being a great man on 
another world and when his hopes 
degringoladed, he was rescued 
from obloquy and shameful death 
by Erasmus Ballod. With dreams 
dead, his only interest was in the 
legal jigsawery of Avelou. 

The mayor wiped his eyes. “I 
ought to put you to skinning mal- 
feasances and tanning the hides 
with torts. Any more helpful sug- 
gestions?” 

“I wrote my contract, Mr. 
Mayor. Read it before you try.” 

Ballod put a hand on his 
shoulder and asked quietly, “What 
shall I do now, John?” 



T he chief justice cleared his 
throat. He had been with 
Ballod a long time. Ballod was 
the source, of the complexities that 
alone made life endurable. “Billy, 
I thoroughly approved when you 
decided to broaden the economic 
base. You have accomplished this 
in agriculture, and light manu- 
facturing follows. You selected a 
magnificent Ag team. I blame my- 

IF 



70 




self for not keeping an eye on the 
finances.” 

“Not your business, John. I as- 
sign responsibilities.” 

“Can’t you find the money 
somewhere?” 

“Consortorium law holds — no 
off-planet investment capital with- 
out consent of eighty per cent of 
the owners. My peers don’t know 
I’m strapped, or they’d be on me 
like buzzards on a gut. They hate 
me now and in two years I’ll have 
to cut them in on the action — 
but at a price, John, at a price — ” 

He patted the chief justice on 
the shoulder and began to pace 
the floor. “Another assessment? 
Discount franchise prepayments? 
There are some disadvantages to 
owning almost everything my- 
self — ” His lips puckered in a 
soundless whistle. People who 
worked with Ballod had learned 
not to disturb him when he wore 
this blank expression, whistled 
silently and paced. 

He was a man so rock-certain 
of himself that he could indulge 
his whims carelessly, entertained 
by gambling, technical expertise 
and women, by food and shoptalk 
and gossip, by a thousand ap- 
parent irrelevancies while he 
prowled his world in a dozen dis- 
guises of humor, anger, good fel- 
lowship and rage. He could even 
deceive his chief justice, who 
waited now with no impatience 
on the master of Avelou. 

“Is your office safe?” 

DOWN ON THE FARM 



Ballod snorted. 

“If you are contemplating as- 
sassination, my advice is no. A 
triple damage fee on a projected 
earnings basis to College Station 
as their designate would be dis- 
astrous. Your Ag team has per- 
formed brilliantly. The only thing 
they overlooked was the precau- 
tion of an escrow for their ten 
per cent. They are not fools. Jane 
Clapperton is devious as a spider 
web. Ed Deasy is so crooked he 
screws on his boots — and Craw- 
furd Niall? That young man is 
actively dangerous. He can see the 
obvious.” 

Ballod whistled soundlessly. 
The cold amber eyes of the chief 
justice dropped. 

“Sweet reason,” said Ballod 
softly. “I contemplate only an ap- 
peal to sweet reason. ... If you 
want a thing done well,” he added 
after a pause, “you must do it 
yourself.” 

The attention light on his desk 
began to blink slowly. 

“Now damn it, Katie!” he 
roared. “No calls, no nothing 1 
told you, damn it!” 

Women were never afraid of 
Ballod. “You also said you wanted 
to know when the Ag team re- 
turned. Well, they have. Sold five 
harvesters to Hydspe. All papers 
signed. Now, do you want any 
more calls or are you still out of 
town?” 

“Thank you Katie. No calls yet.” 
He touched the plate to off and 

71 




turned to the window again. 
Another neagle flopped by out- 
side, cursing the gravities. Bailed 
laughed without humor. “If you 
want a thing done well, do it your- 
self,” he said tonelessly. 

Ill 

I N THE apple orchard in the 
Lour Valley to the east of 
Avelou stood an outcrop of rock. 
It was relatively flat and about a 
quarter of a hectare in extent. The 
packing and supply sheds took up 
most of the space but at the 
highest point of the rock the Ag 
team had built an orchard opera- 
tions headquarters complete with 
beds, a small kitchen and a gazebo 
on top for control, pleasure and 
observation. 

“Have you ever noticed,” asked 
Crawfurd Niall, “how every little 
group of men makes beer? Beer 
is a universal truth. When you 
stop and think about it, a galaxy 
full of suds is sort of awe-in- 
spiring.” 

“Stop driveling,” said Jane 
Qapperton. 

“It’s kind of inspirational,” 
Niall went on dreamily. “The con- 
quest of space-time and all that, 
on a foaming crest, a beautiful 
breaking wave of — ” 

“All right,” said Jane. “What 
happyened back there?” She tapped 
the floor with the toe of a boot. 

Ed Deasy came up the stair- 
well with bottles under his arm. 

72 



“Pest exterminators on. We 
should have put a cooler up here. 
You wanted cider, Jane?” 

Niall kissed the label of the 
bottle and levered off the wedge 
top. Bubbles creamed to the sur- 
face. He drank deep, looked at 
Jane and licked off the white mus- 
tache with a gourmet tongue. “I 
have always wondered whether it 
is better to let the foam dry and 
then lick, or — don’t throw that, 
Jane — I suppose there are some 
things man is not meant.to know. 
All right. I saw old Billy Ballod 
in a work suit Harun-al-Rashiding 
around that harvester this morn- 
ing before we took off ^ — but 
everybody knows that electricians 
are crazy. When Ed plugged it in 
right, they bought five, didn’t 
they?” 

Deasy said, “Next year brab- 
bage isn’t going to be worth two 
minutes a kilo. Exporting in 
controlled-atmosphere freighters 
could be the answer. New freight 
line might just pay off.” 

Jan Qappperton glared at them 
both. 

“I had a shiver down my back,” 
said Niall soberly. “When you 
poured in that vermiculite I got 
to thinking about Ballod and how 
I wouldn’t look so good without 
a head, so I stuck my elbows 
out.” 

1 KNOW,” said Jane. “That hole 
took about a third of what 
it usually takes. You had enough 




room to duck. That’s not what I’m 
talking about. When we were lift- 
ing over the mountains, coming 
home, you two tore that power 
room apart and threw something 
over, and down into the canyon 
depths — ” 

“I had a real attack of the 
stupids not to think of it sooner,” 
said Niall. “It was just a little 
fire. I think it was a destruct on 
the interrupter. We threw both 
overboard while we were still gain- 
ing altitude. That’s why the in- 
terrupter didn’t work.” 

“Barometric triggering device,” 
said Deasy. “Armed on first land- 
ing. Set to interrupt aggie unit 
when pressure dropped. Old idea. 
Good idea if it works.” 

Jane shuddered. “I can under- 
stand wanting to kill Crawfurd,” 
she said. “But why me?” 

“With me headless in Hydspe,” 
said Niall, “you two would still 
collect the team money. But af- 
ter my pitiful accident two sui- 
cides might have a sincere look, 
especially in an MH-30-thousand 
bus.” 

It was dusk by now. The little 
fixed-distance lasers were snap- 
ping at a new hatch of coddling 
moths in the apple orchard below 
them. The moths made tiny puffs 
of flame and occasionally there 
was a series of crackling firepoints 
when leafhoppers jumped into the 
lasef in alarm. 

A crawly-crawly jacked itself 
out of the ground from time to 

DOWN ON THE FARM 



time and the lasers blipped until 
movement stopped. 

“Question of money,” said 
Deasy. 

Niall said, “Don’t forget that 
Ballod was successful in a danger- 
ous and damn unsavory profession. 
In times of danger, Bdlod will re- 
turn to the old pattern of Looter.” 
“I can see that,” said Jane. “Is 
he short of money?” 

“Who wants to pay?” asked 
Deasy. 

“Five years ago, before we 
signed the contract, we talked 
about this very thing. We could 
have written in a monthly or semi- 
annual settlement of our percent- 
age but we took a gamble. We 
guessed right. A cash lump sum 
is always a shock but I never ex- 
pected to give Billy this big a 
shock. He’s overreacting. Maybe, 
we can keep him off balance.” 
‘It’s all right to be smartsy” 
said Jane, “but it’s like teasing a 
tiger. How smart are we to stay 
here?” 

“Dear Jane, if we were smart 
we never would have started this 
journey. When Ballod’s dumb 
brother kidnapped us and died — 
we could have gone home. Instead 
we took that leaky tub into the 
Comity of Worlds. I don’t know 
if we’re smart to stay here or not 
— but granted our goals, there’s 
nothing else we can do. Besides, 
Ed and I took a few precautions.” 
“It’s just that sometimes I feel 
time and circumstances breathing 



73 




down my neck,” she apologized. 

“I got my doodle out of the 
shop,” said Deasy. “Ballod’s seen 
me working on it for three years 
off and on.” 

“I went to Parts Supply and 
visited every harvester Avelou 
owns while you filled out papers 
in the office, Jane. I packed 
some baggage. Those five ma- 
chines mean another MH-6-thou- 
sand owing us. We’ve got to 
tighten the screws on Ballod until 
he squeaks.” 

O VER at the edge of the 
orchard a laser shuttered. 
This was uncommon because 
the native animals had learned to 
stay away from the twenty-meter 
cleared zone around the trees. 

“Did we ever tell anyone about 
the anti-vermin defense?” asked 
Niall mildly. 

“Perimeter lasers have rheo- 
stats,” said Deasy. “No use shoot- 
ing mice with elephant guns. Na- 
tives restless tonight.” 

The overheads cut in. They 
found targets and suddenly rocket 
trails seared the night sky in 
colorful arcs away from the or- 
chard. The perimeter lasers were 
active. A burned tang hung in 
the air. The lasers faltered mo- 
mentarily and the lights dimmed. 
The standby generator droned to 
Hfe and picked up the load. Shout- 
ing and angry voices came from 
the distance — and a constant soft 
blittering as the lasers hit targets. 



Deasy extended the range of the 
overheads and at once there were 
fireworks in the sky. Shortly 
silence fell, broken only by an oc- 
casional snapping at moths. 

Deasy said with satisfaction, 
“Very pretty installation, if I did 
it myself. Worth every second we 
paid for it.” 

“Stupid, stupid, stupid,” said 
Niall. “It’s not only the wrong 
season for stealing apples — but 
if we got killed the College Sta- 
tion contract examiners would find 
at least one of those idiots eager 
for informatioh money. I wonder 
if they were firemen or the fuzz. 
I’d like to think that Billy Bal- 
lod’s getting senile.” 

The phone buzzed and Niall 
answered. 

The mayor grinned and said, 
“We’re having the opening cere- 
monies at the Pleasure Cube to- 
night. All Division heads will be 
there. Twenty-two hundred.” 

“Our time is your time.” The 
two men smiled at each other and 
the mayor cut off. “Until noon,” 
Niall added. 

Jane Clapperton watched them 
both and found it difficult to 
choose between the two smiles. 
Either one should have frosted the 
liquid crystal phone plate.

E rasmus Ballod stood out re- 
splendent in Avelou red with 
a frothy jabot of gold shimmering

in the light, greeting his guests 
and thoroughly enjoying himself. 

“Swelled up big as a toad,” 
whispered Jane Clapperton as 
she and Deasy and Niall walked 
into the Pleasure Cube. They 
joined the brilliantly dre>scd men 
and women congratulating Ballod 
at the entry to the great lobby. 

The lobby was so complex a 
maze of color, perfume, lights and 
music that Ballod himself, with 
his overwhelming curiosity about 
the workings of men and ma- 
chinery, did not attempt to see 
it as a whole. It was segmented 
into thirty-seven zones, each dis- 
tinguished from any other by 
sound and scent barriers, by decor, 
by the food, drink and drugs avail- 
able in each. The intent of the 
lobby was that customers would 
gravitate to the area that most 
fully met their inclinations and 
explore pleasure from that zone. 

The entry was essentially neu- 
tral. The air was negatively 
charged. The humidity was low 
and the scent was high country. 
Ballod had a glass in his hand, 
and beamed at a pretty woman. 

“Stay out of the yellow,” he 
whispered loudly and winked. 
“Sex is not a spectator sport to 
me. But there are others, madam, 
there are others.” A lively little 
man asked him if he had tried 
all the zones. “Not on your life, 
sir. If you come across a weepy, 
bathetic pink area, that’s one I 
couldn’t stick.” He laughed joy- 

DOWN ON THE FARM 



ously. “And what I had to say 
about a pure white zone should 
have sooted the walls.” 

Ballod was charming. He greet- 
ed the Ag team with high good 
spirits. His eyes reflected the real 
pleasure he took in their pres- 
ence. Jane wore filmy gray and a 
few gold spangles to accent her 
straw-gold hair. Deasy was lean 
in rust and red and Niall was 
elegant in powder blue. 

“Been grubbing in the dirt, I 
see,” said Ballod. 

“How nice of you to ask us to 
your party,” said Jane, and curt- 
sied. Deasy offered a thin-lipped 
grin and the mayor and Niall 
touched palms with no hesitation. 

“It’s all on the house tonight,” 
said Ballod. “Go where you want 
to go, do what you want to do. 
Have fun. Be happy.” 

He opened his arms to give 
them the f.reedom of the Pleasure 
Cube, and turned to greet others. 

“Remarkable man,” said Deasy. 

“Let’s go see what Billy hath 
wrought,” said Niall. 

“He is a complete and perfect 
bastard,” said Jane softly. 

The entry was at one end of 
the lobby and raised above the 
general level of the floor. While 
it was perfectly possible to pull a 
string tight from one end of the 
lobby to the other, the eye was 
so constantly distracted, the sen- 
ses so beguiled that it was im- 
possible in fact to see from one 
end to the other. There were is- 



75 




lands and alcoves and balconies 
with floor coverings and ceiling 
height^ appropriate to the zone. In 
common, they each had a door 
which led to intense indulgence 
of the pleasure suggested by the 
zone. 

T he joy of childhood was 
to one side and cuddly 
creatures scrambled over the 
rug to pick up cookie crumbs. 
There was a quiet library with 
lamps for scholars — Niall walked 
over to smell the leather bind- 
ings and dust and floor polish. 
There was a torture chamber, 
dimly lit and smoky orange. There 
was a beach with waves lapping 
onto the sand. There was aching 
young love with lilacs laden with 
raindrops. 

“Original was designed in Col- 
lege Station as exercise for psy- 
chological engineers,” said Deasy. 
“Ruler of stinking little planet had 
all the erotica built for private 
pleasure. He died in three months, 
happy as a clam. This is the 
third Cube in the galaxy — and 
the biggest by far.” 

“You have to walk through the 
store to get to the beer,” said 
Niall, examining the yellow zone 
dispassionately. They strolled on 
past mother love and a gymnasium 
redolent of sweat and a noisy bar 
and a chess island. 

Jane said, “The last thing I be- 
lieve in is ‘natural’ man — and 
yet I cannot help but wonder if 



synthetic reality will not be Ar- 
mageddon. My feet hurt.” 

“Not here.” Niall led her past 
a warm orchid area where sex was 
both participation and exotic. 
“Let’s try this place. We’ll add a 
little color to the heavenly scene. 
What happens when you g o 
through a door?” he asked Deasy. 

“Hypnospray to fix your in- 
clination, chronoleptogenic to give 
you a long ride — then total in- 
volvement mental and physical. 
You get unscrambled at the end. 
Ninety-nine and ‘seventy-five per 
cent unscrambled.” 

“Is that figure any good?” 
asked Niall. 

“No,” said Deasy. 

Niall stared. 

“All mechanical?” 

“Of the very first chop,” said 
Deasy indignantly. “Aside from 
the mechanics it takes two men 
to run this place. A ticket taker 
and a standby psychiatrist. Tech- 
nologically, nothing can compare 
with a Pleasure Cube.” 

Erasmus Ballod found them 
all in there wrangling a m i c - 
ably about who would get the 
next round of beer from the bar 
down the way. None of them 
cared for the ambrosia and nec- 
tar immediately available. 

“I hoped you would try a 
door,” said Ballod. “That would 
have kept you happy for six 
months. Let’s get out of here. 
The whole goddam place gives 
me the creeps.”

4 4^“T^hat's the way it is,” said 
A Bailed, who was asking for 
understanding in dignified sim- 
plicity. He stood by the window 
overlooking Avelou, his face calm 
and sincere. 

“Then what do you propose,” 
said Niall, lounging in a 
deep chair. Jane sat on a foot- 
stool beside him, her back very 
straight; she was studying Ballod's 
face. Deasy straddled a chair with 
his arms folded on top, his chin 
in his hands. 

“We want our money,” said 
Jane. 

“The exact amount is MH- 
1, 012, 597, including yesterday’s 
percentage,” said Deasy. 

Ballod sat behind his desk and 
chuckled. “Five years ago you 
were three youngsters up for bid 
at College Station. My bid was 
modest and lower than two 
others, except for the percentage. 
And now you are in a position 
to dictate to me, to threaten the 
stability of a multi-billion enter- 
prise. How do you account fpr 
this?” He wanted to know. He 
was genuinely curious. 

“Ten per cent of the net on 
apples and brabbage,” said Jane. 

“Comprehensive understanding 
of growing, breeding, marketing 
and sub-contract manufacture,” 
said Deasy. 

“Your noninterference. And 
you might have found a clue in

our release price from College Sta- 
tion. You bought us out very 
cheap, Mr. Mayor.” 

Ballod whistled soundlessly as 
he met Niall’s eyes. 

“True enough,” he said slowly. 
“I noticed that and never followed 
it up — Then your education was 
not entirely at College Station. 
Tell me this — were you waiting 
for me?” 

“We were just lucky, I guess. 
We wanted to make money.” 

“You have, my boy. No ques- 
tion.” Ballod’s smile was a little 
wry. “Now, let me make a sug- 
gestion. Let me pay you a nom- 
inal sum now, say MH-one hun- 
dred thousand and at the end of 
a year I will pay you MH-one 
million one hundred Aousand. We 
can draw it up as a primary lien 
against the city guaranteed by the 
Central Bank. You will make 
twenty per cent or your money by 
your forbearance — roughly ten 
years’ wages apiece on the salary 
scale at which you signed the 
contract. No restrictions on your 
activities. Take another job. Go 
back to College Station. Buy land 
on an open planet. Do precisely as 
you please.” 

“We want our money now,” 
^aid Jane. 

Ballod looked at her quizzically. 
“When you have enough money,” 
he mused, “money becomes a 
counter in a game. It’s a tally, 
a method of keeping score. You 
sleep in one bed, you put on your 



77 




pants one leg at a time, you have 
limited physical capacity for any 
indulgence.” He turned to Niall. 
“What game are you playing? 
What is it you want?” 

“Not your city and not your 
power.” 

“You may have me between a 
hard place and a rock.” said Bai- 
led, “but do not be too greedy.” 
“Is Little Sister fueled? Stores 
aboard? Ready for space?” 

“Yes.” 

“We’U take it.” 

B allod half rose, stared at* 
them and sat down. Blood 
flushed his face. 

He raised his voice and it had 
a metallic edge, “All right, John. 
I tried your way. Now I’ll try my 
own.” 

The chief justice came in with 
two laser hand guns. He looked 
ill but deadly. 

“All peegee units have modi- 
fiers,” said Deasy. “Otherwise you 
couldn’t move them.” 

“No goddam idle threats from 
you stinking intransigent sons-of- 
bitches!” roared Ballod, suddenly 
losing control. 

“You had those peegee units 
manufactured at College Station,” 
said Niall. 

“The modifier is in the deepest 
vault of Central Bank. Get up and 
get out.” 

“I made another,” said Deasy. 
“Took me three years. You over- 
charged us on the computer time. 



Microminiaturized, here it is. 
Short range. Not selective. All 
sixty-four peegee units under Ave- 
lou will go null at once. City 
hall is on natural gravity. We’ll 
be all right here.” 

“Ed built in an interesting 
electroencephalographic switch,” 
drawled Niall. “It activates if you 
take him away from it.” 

“Bluff,” snarled Ballod, “nobody 
can duplicate a peegee modifier.” 
“Best I could do with such little 
control was set minimum for one 
second.” 

“Want a second’s worth of 
proof?” asked Niall. 

Ballod wheeled and walked to 
the window. His city glowed softly 
in the night. The casinos never 
closed. There were people in the 
parks. A small boat with a lum- 
iniscent sail was tacking out of 
the bay. The buildings of Avelou 
loomed in the night sky at all 
angles. 

“Fifty thousand blameless men 
and women,” he growled. “Res- 
taurants are open, theaters are 
full. One of those apartments is 
a nursery. I don’t know how many 
children are there tonight.” He 
looked at Jane and said mourn- 
fully, “Would you kill all those 
babies and innocent children?” 
“Once it is determined that a 
women will sell,” said Jane, “all 
that remains to be determined is 
the price. Old joke. And once it 
has been determined that a man 
wiU kiU — ”

“You immoral monster! You 
have no compassion, no sense 
of — ” blurted the chief justice. 

44 A ND you, sir,” said Jane 
,/\with the same slow voice, 
“sold the resources of a planet to 
a Looter. You were a knowing 
catspaw when you arranged the 
cinnebar leases to Looter Ballod. 
What were you paid for your 
betrayal of the United Nations? 
What were you paid for the sixty- 
four thousand tons of liquid mer- 
cury Ballod stole from Earth? 
Your name is reviled in a hun- 
dred tongues. Traitor is an abom- 
inable word in Interlingua — or 
English.” 

The old man shriveled before 
their eyes. 

“We learned to operate the 
magnetic flow mining equipment 
Ballod had to abandon,” said 
Niall, “but do you know what a 
flask of mercury sells for now? 
What it sold for when we left, 
when Ballod’s stupid brother look- 
ed us up and kidnapped us? One 
flask, seventy-six pounds of mer- 
cury, two hundred and seventy- 
five thousand dollars.” 

“How could your own people 
reach the stars without mercury?” 
asked Jane. 

“Not so religious on Earth any 
more,” said Deasy. “Don’t hear 
much about Judas Iscariot. Got 
another name we use.” 

The chief justice shook. His 
face wrenched and his eyes went

wild. Ballod shot him when he 
raised a pistol. He slumped to the 
rug with the rictus still on his 
lean skull face. 

“He was going to shoot him- 
self,” obsen^ed Jane. 

“Billy was just protecting the 
modifier,” said Niall. “Very sen- 
sible. Just suppose the old man 
plugged Ed. Down tumbles Ave- 
lou.” 

“Nice thing about lasers,” said 
Deasy. “They cauterize. No blood 
on rug. Very tidy.” 

Ballod breathed hard. His gold- 
en jabot shimmered. “You three 
belong to a human branch that 
should be cut off. I never should 
have traded the location of your 
rotten planet to my brother. He 
would have sold Avelou cheap 
enough. It was a tumbledown vil- 
lage — ” His voice faded as he 
looked at his city on the hills. 
“All right,” he said. He straight- 
ened. His face went hard. He 
was filled with menace. “Give me 
the modifier. Take the ship.” 
“Easy,” said Niall. “Let’s go to 
the Central Bank and register Lit- 
tle Sister to us.” 

“God, how I despise you!” 
“Sincerity at last,” said Jane. 
“Come along to spaceport,” 
said Deasy. “Got our baggage 
there. You give us clearance.” 
“Hold on just one minute,” said 
Ballod, in control of himself 
again. “How do I know I can 
trust you?” 

Jane smiled, Deasy snickered

and Niall said wearily, “We are from Avelou. Bailed did not spare

Three hated faces appeared in 
the screen. 

“Short-range modifier?” said 
Ballod. 

“Just one more thing. Glad you 
called, Billy — ” began Niall. 

“Your stinking race can rot on 
Earth. You’ve got three minutes 
to live.” 

“Brabbage,” said Niall. “Billy 
buddy, you told us to plant just 
one helluva lot of it around Ave- 
lou and you’re surrounded by 
thirty thousand hectares. There 
aren’t enough flamethrowers on 
the planet to do the job before 
bolting. Call off your dogs.” 

“You didn’t take the harvest- 
ers with you.” 

Niall held up a computer. “Got 
all these with us,” he said. “Nice 
of you to help us load the bag- 
gage. Manufacturing lead time on 
computers for harvesters is three 
months — ” 

“Got it down to nine weeks,” 
said Deasy. 

“Ever see pictures of Jalka Is- 
land?” asked Jane. “The seventy- 
seventy-two strain produces a big- 
ger head — ” 

“Bury Avelou thirty meters 
deep — ” 

Ballod’s face was iron as he 
pressed missile destruct. 

“Fair’s fair,” said NiaU. “We’ll 
mail the computers back from Col- 
ege Station.” 

Ballod laughed. He bellowed 
with amusement. His blue eyes 
crinkled and his face turned red.

He wiped the tears from his eyes. 

“Any other tricks up your 
sleeves?” he asked. 

None of the three had smiled. 

“We’ll send the modifier with 
the computers,” said Niall. 

“Ballod was right,” said Deasy. 
“Never could solve that key. It 
was a bluff.” 

“Shall we mail the bluff with 
switch on or off?” asked Jane, 

Ballod stared at them. 

“And some people call me 
ruthless!” 

“Goodbye, Daddy,” said Jane. 
“We’re half-brothers and sister. 
Your three wives — our mothers 
— don’t exactly send their love, 



but I think we’ll be welcome back 
on Earth with a starship.” 

“Why did you tell him that, 
Jane?” asked Niall. 

“And, Daddy, one more thing. 
We are your children. But I 
wouldn’t be easy to find in another 
six months if I were you.” She 
turned to Niall. “I don’t like

“Gives pop something to think

They laughed together as the

OF 

OUR 
EARTH 



2. The First Traces Of Life 



T he most important event 
in the early history of our 
earth, as far as we are concerned 
— and observers from another 
planet would probably agree — 
was the beginning of life. 

But this event had to be pre- 
ceded by another — the formation 
of liquid water. Our earth and 
the other planets of the solar sys- 
tem are the results of an accumu- 
lation of matter from a cosmic 
cloud. Zones of condensation 
must have existed in that cloud — 
places where the dust and gas 
began to form local aggregations 
that then tightened because of the 
mutual gravitational attraction of 



the component parts. Once these 
local aggregations were massive 
enough, they began sweeping up 
whatever additional matter they 
encountered. But the condensation 
of matter and the sweeping up of 
additional matter mean that an 
endless number of collisions be- 
tween the particles takes place and 
when particles hit, their kinetic 
energy is largely changed into 
another form of energy, namely 
heat. So the whole must grow hot. 

It is not possible to give a figure 
for the temperature of the earth 
during its process of formation. 
It certainly was far above the boil- 
ing point of water. On the other 



83 



hand, it certainly was not as hot 
as the outer layers of our sun 
which have a temperature of 
6000® centigrade, corresponding 
to about 10,000° Fahrenheit. The 
temperature at which iron melts, 
1535° centigrade, corresponding 
to 2435° Fahrenheit, or a few 
hundred degrees above that tem- 
perature, seems a reasonable 
guess. 

Which makes the earth — at 
one time in its history — a large 
ball of molten rock surrounded 
by an atmosphere hundreds of 
miles in depth and hot by our 
standards, yet cooler than the 
body of the earth itself. 

The bulk of this atmosphere 
consisted of hydrogen and helium 
but it also contained other gases 
that are not elements but chemical 
compounds. Such compounds, in 
order to remain stable, need tem- 
peratures below 1000° Fahren- 
heit — at higher temperatures 
compounds fall apart. The original 
mixture of elements that formed 
the earth must have contained a 
certain amount of oxygen — and 
since oxygen is a rather active 
element it combined with every- 
thing within reach, once the tem- 
perature was down to a point 
where compounds could form. 

The oxygen combined with hy- 
drogen to form water (because of 
the still high temperature the wa- 
ter was gaseous) ; it combined with 
sulfur to form sulfur dioxide and 
with carbon to form carbon di- 



oxide. The hydrogen was active, 
too. It combined with nitrogen to 
form ammonia, with carbon and 
nitrogen to form hydrogen cya- 
nide, with chlorine to form hydro- 
chloric acid, with carbon to form 
methane and so forth — a whole 
range of substances with simple 
molecules. 

The hydrogen that remained 
free — because there was nothing 
left with which it might have 
formed compounds — gradually 
escaped into space, as did the 
helium that does not combine with 
anything. As the earth cooled, its 
atmosphere grew smaller and 
denser; for a time it may have 
contained mercury compounds in 
the form of vapors, similar to 
those believed to be present in the 
atmosphere of Venus. 

As the cooling progressed the 
temperature, in some places, must 
have gone below 200 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 

The water vapor then became 
water, trying to fall as rain. Of 
course the rain that formed in 
the upper and cooler layers of the 
atmosphere did not reach the 
ground. As it fell down into hotter 
atmospheric layers it evaporated 
again. But this evaporation 
removed heat from the surround- 
ing gases that thereby grew 
heavier and continued the down- 
ward movement, forcing lighter 
and hotter gases up. This process 
created vertical convection cur- 
rents that carried hot gases into 

IF 



84 




the upper layers, where they ra- 
diated their heat away into space. 
It can easily be seen that such 
convection currents accelerated 
the cooling process, for naturally 
a hotter body radiates its heat 
away faster than a cooler body. It 
does not matter whether the 
“body” in question is a gas, a liq- 
uid or a solid. 

In time the rain did reach 
the ground. 

I F THERE were any tall moun- 
tains at the time we could 
assume that the rain-forming ac- 
tivities were strongest in the vi- 
cinity of such mountains, the 
liquid water cascading down the 
mountainsides, returning from 
the hot lowlands as water vapor 
to the higher layers of the atmo- 
sphere. 

The result would have been 
steadily growing circles of rainfall, 
each with a mountain in its center. 

However, we don’t know 
whether there were tall mountains 
on the early earth and several 
reasons exist to doubt it. But there 
must have been cool spots in the 
atmosphere, for rain did fall and 
gradually the steady downpour 
that had started in only a few 
places spread out and cooled the 
surface rocks until water remain- 
ed water. The first pools that fill- 
ed natural depressions were boil- 
ing hot — but they remained 
liquid. And hot water is more 
effective for dissolving minerals 

THE STORY OF OUR EARTH 



than cold water, so that all the 
early bodies of water were a thin 
broth of a number of minerals. 

Many of the compounds that 
floated around in the atmosphere, 
especially the carbon dioxide, 
were water-soluble, too, so that 
the early pools were solutions of 
almost anything. This phe- 
nomenon formed the background 
for the emergence of life. As we 
now know — and can demons- 
trate in chemical laboratories — 
such a solution, with an at- 
mosphere holding methane and 
ammonia above it, will produce 
“peculiar” chemicals if energy is 
supplied. The energy in question 
could be either electrical dis- 
charges — like lightning — or ul- 
traviolet radiation that forms a 
part of sunlight. The peculiarity of 
the chemicals mentioned above is 
that all are found in living tissues 
in our own time — they are “or- 
ganic” molecules which include 
some of the so-called amino acids 
which are, in turn, building blocks 
of the proteins. 

It is quite conceivable that this 
process still occurs in nature in 
a few places on earth — but if it 
does happen the results will dis- 
appear fast. They will be eaten 
up by existing microscopic life 
forms. When it happened for the 
first time, half a million years or 
so before the beginning of the 
Cambrian period, there were no 
microorganisms. Hence the amino 
acids and other “organic” mole- 



85 




cules could accumulate and fuse 
into still larger molecules. 

A living cell — let us use the 
term, though it is by no means 
certain that it applied to those 
earliest super-molecules — shows 
that it is alive by doing at least 
four things. The first is that it 
ingests “foreign” substances — 
substances chemically different 
from those in its own physiog- 
nomy. Next it digests these for- 
eign substances by first breaking 
them down into simpler chemical 
compounds and then reassembling 
these to form the more compli- 
cated compounds in its own make- 
up. In this process some material 
is inevitably left over as either 
useless or surplus — this is the 
“waste matter” discharged by the 
living body. The third feature of 
a living cell is that it grows in 
size and bulk. Fourth, it produces 
or reproduces its own kind. 

For some time the early life 
on the young earth was in a pre- 
carious situation. 

It could only eat those medium- 
complicated molecules that had 
arisen from the action of ultra- 
violet radiation on the naturally 
occurring simple molecules. There 
must have been cases where the 
appetite of the living cells exceed- 
ed the supply of foodstuffs pro- 
duced by chemical reactions. No 
doubt there were local extinctions. 

The living cells had to learn 
that something could be done with 
sunlight directly — they had to 



invent what we now call photo- 
synthesis. Once the process was 
working, its possessors did not 
need the amino acids and other 
substances of that type — they 
could operate on dissolved min- 
erals, carbon dioxide and sun- 
light. The first plants fit the above 
category — the earlier life forms 
that did not have photosynthesis 
must, of necessity, be considered 
ultra-primitive animals. Of course 
they were succeeded by not quite 
so primitive animals, namely those 
that ate the plants that had created 
supplies of organic compounds by 
photosynthesis in their own bodies. 

Fortunately for the continued 
existence of earthly plants and, 
through them, of life in general, 
the primitive life forms that must 
be called animals did not special- 
ize in eating chlorophyll-bearing 
plants only. They ate what got in 
their way, whether amino acids 
that were still formed by chemi- 
cal action, or plants, or other ani- 
mals. Presumably they pushed 
evolution by behaving competi- 
tively. 

It can be taken for granted that 
not even the largest of these early 
life forms could be seen by an 
unaided eye. But where they were 
numerous, say in a nearly closed 
bay, they mi^t have been collec- 
tively visible as a faint clouding 
of the water. 

I T IS strange that this very 
modem concept sounds a bit 

iF 



86 




like the repetition of an evo- 
lutionary concept of a hundred 
years ago. At that time you could 
read that life had probably begun 
as ‘‘primordial ooze” in the seas. 
The term was a polite translation 
of the German word Urschleim 
which really means primordial 
mucus, but the idea was that the 
first life forms were not yet sep- 
arated into individuals but formed 
a jellylike covering of the bottom. 
At one time it was even thought 
that the jelly had been discovered. 
The first major oceanographic ex- 
pedition, that of HM.S, Challen- 
ger, had collected numerous sam- 
ples of bottom mud from several 
oceans. The bottom mud was put 
into nice sterile glass jars which 
were then filled with pure alcohol 
to keep it from deteriorating. 
Some years later somebody looked 
at one of these jars and discov- 
ered a very faint clouding. It was 
barely visible but it was there and 
it seemed as if a small quantity of 
the Urschleim Professor Ernst von 
Haeckel in Germany was always 
talking about had been captured 
by accident. 

Thomas Huxley decided that 
this was so and named it Bothy- 
bius haeckeli — after Dr. Haeckel 
— who was greatly pleased, of 
course, but he had occasion to be 
violently displeased a number of 
years later. A British chemist 
wanted to know more about the 
Bathybius haeckeli, acquired a 
surplus jar in which it was pres- 

THE STORY OF OUR EARTH 



ent and set out to analyze it. He 
discovered that the clouding phe- 
nomenon was not at all organic 
in origin. It was strictly a chemical 
precipitate that had originated be- 
cause of the interaction of the 
“preserving” alcohol with the bot- 
tom mud. 

Still, the water of a bay in 
Precambrian times could have 
looked as if Haeckel’s Urschleim 
were present — but it consisted 
of a very large number of separate 
living units. If the majority of the 
living units in a certain body of 
water were plants the clouding 
might have looked greenish. Of 
course the plants (and the animals 
that depended upon them) lived 
mainly near the shore, where the 
mineral content of the water was 
high. Bays must have been the 
most logical places or else the 
areas where a river brought rain- 
water into the sea, carrying more 
minerals. 

It must be kept in mind that 
in Precambrian times the differ- 
ence in saltiness between the 
ocean and a river was still rather 
miilor. By now the seas are salty 
because rivers, working day and 
night for many hundreds of mil- 
lions of years, have leached out 
the minerals from the soils of the 
continents and carried them into 
the oceans. When ocean water 
evaporates to become water vapor 
the minerals are left behind in 
the ocean and the water vapor, 
after it has drifted over the land, 

R7 




condensed and fallen as rain, 
brings more dissolved minerals to 
the seas. Nowadays the difference 
between Ocean water and river wa- 
ter is pronounced — but in Pre- 
cambrian times the process had 
only recently begun. 

Plants, when they build their 
bodies of sunlight, carbon dioxide 
and trace minerals, produce a 
waste product — free oxygen. The 
main waste product of oxygen- 
breathing animals is carbon diox- 
ide and a nice balance would seem 
to have been established right 
from the beginning. However, 
since all this began at a time 
when free oxygen hardly existed, 
the early “animals” probably were 
not oxygen breathers. They uti- 
lized their food not by oxidation 
but by fermentation, a process 
that yields far less energy but does 
not require oxygen. In fact the 
fermentation processes we know 
usually release some oxygen too. 

As a result, free oxygen was 
returned into an atmosphere that 
had been deficient in oxygen for 
hundreds of millions of years — 
and the next revolution in the 
evolution of life was the emer- 
gence of the oxygen-breather who, 
by utilizing a different chenucal 
process (namely oxidation) be- 
came a far more efficient animal. 

None of this can be read from 
the fossil record — in fact, the 
absence of a fossil record is the 
main characteristic of the Precam- 
brian sediments. Nor is the lack 



of such a record difficult to ex- 
plain. All living things were tiny 
and the normal end of their lives 
was to be swallowed by some- 
thing faster, bigger or stronger. 
And since they were all free- 
floating organisms, none of them 
had any need for hard parts of 
the body to serve as strengthen- 
ing members. Consequently there 
were no hard parts to fossilize, 
not even parts hard enough to 
cause an impression in soft mud 
that by a combination of lucky 
chances might be preserved for 
posterity. 

Early in this century virtually 
every book on geology carried a 
drawing of something called Ech 
zoon canadense, the “dawn ani- 
mal from Canada.” It was a 
piece of striated rock which could 
be the remains of a very early 
sponge, or else a colony of early 
and primitive corals. Of course it 
could also be something that had 
no living relatives — at any event 
it was revered as the oldest known 
fossil. As time went on Eozoon 
canadense was as quietly dropped 
as Haeckel’s Urschleim, If I re- 
member correctly it turned out 
that the rock in which Eozoon 
was found turned out to be much 
younger than Precambrian stuff. 

H owever, a small number of 
fossils of Precambrian age 
are now known. A comparatively 
good one recently turned up in 
eastern Transvaal. It consists of

Figure 1. Map of the earth at the beginning of the Cambrian period as geologists thought it to have

map is correct concerning areas of current continents shown to be above water. But the enormous 
land bridges between South America, Africa and Australia did not exist. 



THE STORY OF OUR EARTH 



89 






we look at these early Cambrian 
animals (which will be the theme 
of the next article) we need a look 
at the earth as a whole as it was 
about 600 million years ago. 

Size and shape were the same 
as now. The day probably was 
shorter by a numl^r of hours than 
it is now. The atmosphere did not 
differ much from our current at- 
mosphere except for one factor: 
the oxygen content was probably 
about 3 per cent instead of the 
current 20 per cent. 

How about the distribution of 
land and water? 

At the time when Eozoon can- 
adense was still acclaimed the old- 
est fossil the same book picturing 
it was also likely to carry a map 
like our Fig. 1. There were three 
main continents, two of them in 
the north and one in the south. 
The two northern continents were 
North America in the west and 
Asia in the east. The southern con- 
tinent was called Gondwanaland. 
As the map shows, it was sup- 
posed to stretch from South Amer- 
ica eastward across the Atlantic, 
comprise most of Africa and ex- 
tend eastward to the Australian 
area. 

We now know that this map 
was wrong — but it was the result 
of careful reasoning based on a 
fantastic amount of detail work. 
The existence of Gondwanaland 
was not derived so much from 
the sediments, or lack of them. 



during the Cambrian period but 
had been extrapolated backward 
because of later evidence. During 
the time of the early (emphasis 
on “early”) dinosaurs a great deal 
of evidence existed that southern 
Asia, Africa, South America and 
at least parts of the Australian 
region had all been connected. The 
most logical conclusion that could 
be drawn from the evidence was 
that all these now separated land 
areas had once formed a long 
southern continent — Gondwana- 
land. And since the existence of 
Gondwanaland seemed certain for 
the Permian and Triassic periods, 
that continent must have existed 
in earlier times, too. That is how 
it got onto the map of the Cam- 
brian period. 

We now know what went wrong 
in that reasoning. 

Geologists, in the course of 
their work, had found numerous 
instances of past reversals of land 
and water. At one time, during 
the days of the late dinosaurs, 
Kansas and adjacent areas had 
been under water. Manunoth tusks 
found at the bottom of the North 
Sea — much to the annoyance of 
the fishermen whose nets were 
tom in the process — proved that 
the North Sea had been dry land 
at one time. So it seemed that 
the sea and the land could change 
places. Hence, if fossils compelled 
geologists to conclude that Africa 
and South America had once been

connected, they felt free to assume 
a land connection across the 
southern Atlantic which later dis- 
appeared under the waves. 

The mistake was the failure to 
make a distinction between deep 
ocean and flooded land. That sea 
that once covered Kansas had 
been a shallow sea, just as is the 
North Sea of our time. In both 
cases you simply dealt with a por- 
tion of a continent that was low- 
lying enough to be covered by a 
few hundred feet of water. But 
the ocean between Africa and 
South America was deep ocean. 
Since the evidence that there had 
once been a connection between 
these two continents could not be 
disregarded, only one logical con- 
clusion was possible — the con- 
tinents themselves had moved. 
South America and Africa had 
once been the same continent, un- 
til a line of weakness broke open 
to form a water-filled trench. Then 
South America moved westward, 
pushed by the ever widening trench 
that finally became the Atlantic 
Ocean, while Africa stayed more

This is the theory of Continen-

half a century ago and it needed 
all that time to gain the general 
acceptance it now h^. The shape 
of the continents of today can be 
explained by assuming Aat they

inal continent was still in one 
piece. And it was to stay that 
way for quite a number of millions 
of years to come.

THE STORY OF OUR EARTH

KEITH LAUMER 




A life he did not 
recognize. A wife who 
did not know him. A 
world in which he 
alone was sane... 



I 

J EFF Mallory's first thou^t 
when he woke that morning 
was that he was back in the field 
hospital south of Inchon with a 
hole in his shoulder — where a 
Chinese .30-caliber slug had gone 
in — and a bi^er one between 
his ribs where it had come out. 
And Uncle A1 had been there, 
calling to him to come along — 
they were going to the Old House 
and he had wanted to go, even 
thou^ he was stitched and ban- 
daged and confined to bed. 

Mallory moved his shoulders 
experimentally, felt a twinge of 
pain from sore muscles. Probably 
he had moved in his sleep and 
tried to weave the resultant ache 
into a dream that would allow 
him the luxury of a few more 
minutes of cozy oblivion. Strange 
thing, the dream mechanism — as 



93 




if half the brain set out to delude 
the other half. And the haunting 
desire to see the Old House again 
still clung like a memory of a 
long-ago outing. 

He got out of bed, stretched, 
noticing other small aches and 
pains as he did. Old age must be 
catching up with him, he told him- 
self, not meaning it. 

Fog hung like a cottony veil 
across the lawn beyond the cur- 
tained window, making ghosts of 
the poplars at the far side of 
the garden, obscuring detail, blur- 
ring outlines, lending to the fa- 
miliar a hint of the charm of 
the unknown. The Bartlett house, 
looming high and wraithlike be- 
yond the trees, might have been, 
perched on a cliff at the edge of 
the world. The street, dwindling 
into invisibility a half-block away, 
might lead down to a silent beach 
edging a tideless sea. It would be 
pleasant to follow that phan- 
tom shoreline, wade in the warm, 
reed-grown shallows, emerge in 
some pleasanter, simpler world. 

Mallory smil^ at his fancies. 
It would be time enough to start 
dreaming of white beaches when 
the firm of Mallory and Nolan, 
Engineering Consultants, had 
weathered its first year, 
iness. 

As he turned away from the 
window something lying beside 
the hedge lining the Bartletts’ 
drive caught his eye. It was dif- 
ficult to make out in the misty 
light but it looked like an old 
overcoat flung carelessly on the 
grass, a jarring note in the orderly 
composition. Probably scmiething 

94 



left and forgotten by a handyman. 
Mallory put it out of his mind and 
ambled into the bathroom. 

His razor lay on the edge of 
the basin, clogged with gray soap. 
Bless the ladies, he thought as 
he rinsed it under the tap. He 
rummaged in the medicine cabinet 
for a new blade, failed to find 
one. The shaving cream can was 
empty, its spout crusted with dry, 
green foam. The toothpaste tube 
was crumpled and flat. His tooth- 
brush was nowhere in sight. He 
found it after a brief search on 
the floor behind the toilet bowl. 

He used the electric razor Gill 
had given him for Christmas. He 
did not like using it. It did not 
shave close enough and left his 
face feeling dry and unrefreshed. 

Eyeing himself in the mirror, 
he thought he looked a bit gaunt 
and hollow-cheeked. There were 
dark circles under his eyes and he 
was badly in need of a haircut. 
He wore at least a month’s 
growth, he decided, angling his 
head to see the sides. He must 
be working too hard, losing weight, 
forgetting his bi-weekly trim. He 
would have to think about taking 
things easier. 

He noticed a pair of battered 
shoes on the floor of the closet. 
His best pair of Bostonians. The 
soles were badly worn, the uppers 
scuffed deep into the leather, the 
strings broken and knotted. 
Frowning, Mallory looked through 
the hanging clothes for his gray 
suit, found it dangling on a hook 
at the end of the closet. It was 
dusty, shabby. The cuffs were 
greasy black. Both elbows were 



IF 




worn through. It looked, he 
thought, like something a hobo 
might wear, calling at the back 
door for a handout. Lori must 
have borrowed it, he decided, for 
some sort of student Rag Day 
or scavenger hunt thing. To a 
youngster all old folks’ clothes — 
meaning folks over thirty-five — 
probably looked the same. He 
would have to have words with 
that young lady. 

He dropped the coat on the 
floor with the ruined shoes, se- 
lected a tan suit. His favorite tie 
was missing. He picked another, 
smoothed the look off his face. 
Whistling, he went down to break- 
fast. 

G illian was at the stove, 
stirring a pan. Marly 
and Randy, the ten- and eight- 
year-olds, sat at the kitchen table, 
spooning up oatmeal. 

“Looks like I’m last man on 
deck,” Mallory said jovially. 

Gill smiled abstractedly and 
went on with her work. The kids 
did not look up. He poured a 
cup of coffee and pulled out a 
chair. There wpre bread crumbs 
on the seat of the chair and on 
the table. Sugar was scattered 
around the bowl. In a clouded 
glass vase were the dried stems 
of a bunch of faded wildflowers. 
He tried the coffee. It was luke- 
warm, stale-tasting. 

Gill came across and put a bowl 
of oatmeal before him. She was 
still the best-looking girl in town, 
Mallory thought, but this morn- 
ing she looked pale, her skin dull. 
“You’re late, Jeff,” she said. 

THE SEEDS OF GONYL 



“I was just going to call you.” 

“I got involved in looking out 
the window,” he said. “Nice fog.” 

Gill sat down across from him. 

“Fog?” she asked vaguely. 

Mallory glanced through the 
window. The air was sparkling 
clear. 

“Funny. Must have been just 
a patch.” 

He sampled the oatmeal. It was 
barely warm. There was no salt 
in it, no salt on the table, no but- 
ter, no cream. He started to men- 
tion it, glanced at Gill, noticed 
the darkness under her eyes, her 
abstracted expression. 

“Gill — are you feeling all 
right?” 

“Very well, thank you,” she 
said quickly and smiled a fleeting 
smile. 

Mallory got up and went to 
the cupboard where the dry cereal 
was kept. There were half a dozen 
boxes there, their tops tom open, 
all but one empty. He took a 
bowl from the shelf, noticed dust 
in it, rinsed it at the sink. 

“Any toast? he inquired. 

“Toast?” Gill looked mildly 
puzzled. 

“You’ve heard of it — bread 
that’s been in the toaster.” 

He tried to make it sound jolly 
but the words hung dead between 
them. The room was chilly, he 
noticed. A faint, foul odor was 
in the air. Or not so faint, he 
amended, noticing the overflow- 
ing garbage pail by the door. Bits 
of food and soiled paper lay 
around it. 

Marly, the ten-year-old, scraped 
her spoon against her empty 

95 




bowl. She licked it, front and 
back, dropped it on the table and 
stood. Her skirt and sweater did 
not match. 

“Hey, did you kids have any 
milk?” Jeff asked. 

Marly failed to answer. Randy 
pushed his chair back and started 
from the room after his sister. 

“Why did the kids rush out of 
here without a word?” Mallory 
asked. “Is anything wrong?” 

“They have to go to school,” 
Gill said. 

She looked troubled. Mallory 
reached across to put his hand 
over hers. He was shocked at how 
cold it felt under his — and thin. 
And the nails, always so care- 
fully groomed, were chipped, not 
even clean. 

“Gill, what’s the matter?” 

He tried to catch her eye. She 
looked down into her bowl. She 
pulled her hand away, took a bite 
of gruel. 

“Gill — I think you’ve been 
working too hard,” Mallory said. 
“Been around the house too 
much. What do you say we get 
away for a few days? We could 
go out to the Old House diis 
weekend, camp out, do a little 
work on the place. The kids would 
enjoy it and — ” 

“What old house?” 

“Our Old House. What else?” 

G ill looked at him innocently. 
“Do we have an old house?’* 
“Never mind, it was just a 
thought.” 

“You’d better eat,” Gill said. 
“You’ll be late.” 

“One of the prerogatives of be- 



ing boss,” Mallory said, smiling, 
“is that I can be late when I 
want to.” 

Gillian shook her head. 

“You mustn’t joke about your 
work, Jeff.” 

He smiled at her. 

“Why not?” 

Gillian looked concerned. 

“Jeff, you seem so strange this 
morning — ” 

“I was just thinking you seem 
to be in a curiously playful mood.” 
“In what way?” 

“Acting as if you never heard 
of the Old House, teasing me 
about being a few minutes late 
to my own office — ” 

“Jeff, what are you talking 
about?” 

“I’m talking about my business. 
Where I make our living.” 

“Jeff, are you sure you’re feel- 
ing all right?” 

“Why shouldn’t I be?” 

Gill’s glance went to the clock 
over the refrigerator. She made as 
if to rise. 

“We really have to go now — ” 
Mallory caught her hand. 
“Where are you going?” 

“Let me go,” she gas^d. “They 
don’t like it if you’re late — ” 

“Gill — I asked you where 
you’re going.” 

“To the Star Tower, of 
course — ” 

“What’s the Star Tower?” 

“You know,” she whispered. 
“It’s where we work.” 

“We? Since when do you have 
a job?” He tried to smile. “Fm 
the breadwinner around here, re- 
member?” 

She was shaking her head —

IF 




her eyes were wide, fearful. 
Vlallory came to his feet, drew his 
vvife to him. 

“Slow down a minute, girl. 
:^t’s start at the beginning — ” 

He broke off as the front door 
slammed. Through the window he 
.saw Marly and Randy hurrying 
lown the walk. 

“Where are their coats?” he 
aid. “It’s cold out there. And 
neir schoolbooks — ” He turned 
jrgently to Gill. “And where’s 
Lori?” 

“Lori who?” 

“Our daughter, Lori. You 
Know.” He tried to cover the im- 
patient edge to his voice with a 
smile. 

“Our daughter’s name is 
4arly,” Gillian said carefully. 

“Of course. And our other 
daughter’s name is Lori. Has she 
alre^y eaten?” 

G ill gave him a fleeting smile. 

“I’m sorry, I don’t under- 
stand you. I have to go. I mustn’t 
be late to the work rooms.” 
“All ri^t. I’ll play along,” 
Mallory said. “Anything else new 
I ought to know?” 

Gillian looked worried. “Jeff, 
you know the quota has been in- 
creased — ” 

“Oh, so the quota has been 
increased.” 

“So many have not been com- 
ng to their benches.” 

“Their benches? What benches 
are those?” 

“At the workrooms.” 

“What workrooms?” 

“Where we work, of course, 
*eff. Please stop — ”

“Funny, I ±ought I had an of- 
fice in the Miller Building,” Mal- 
lory said harshly. 

Gillian shook her head, glanced 
at the cereal bowl at Mallory’s 
place. 

“You’d better eat quickly. It’s 
a long time to midday break.” 
“Never mind the midday break. 
You still haven’t said where Lori 
is.” 

“I don’t know any Lori — ” 

He gripped her arm. 

“Stop it. Gill! Where is she?” 
He broke off at a sudden thought. 
“There hasn’t been an accident? 
Has she been hurt?” 

“No, there hasn’t been any ac- 
cident. And I don’t know anyone 
named Lori.” 

She tugged against him, trying 
to reach the door. He picked her 
up, carried her to the living room, 
lowered her to the couch. She 
tried to struggle up. He sat beside 
her, held her. 

“There has been an accident, 
hasn’t there?” He tried to hold his 
voice steady. “You’re trying to 
keep it from me, aren’t you?” 

“I don’t know what you mean!” 
“I’m talking about our oldest 
daughter, Lori,” he said, forcing 
himself to speak calmly. “Age, 
nineteen. Born while we were still 
in school. She’s tall, blond, likes 
to ride and swim and play tennis. 
Are you telling me you’ve for- 
gotten her?” 

Gillian looked into his eyes, 
shaking her head. 

“There isn’t any such person, 
Jeff. We have two children, 
Marla and Randy. That’s all.” 
He rose, went into the hall and 

97 




called. There was no answer. He 
ran up the stairs three at a time, 
at the top wheeled to the left, his 
outstretched hand reaching for 
the doorknob. 

He slammed into a solid wall. 
Where the door to Lori’s room 
should have been was an un- 
broken stretch of plaster. 



G ill was standing wide-eyed 
on the landing. 

“Why?” he asked. “Why is her 
room sealed?” His voice was a 
croak. 

“Jeff, you’re frightening. I don’t 
understand — ” 

Mallory ran his hands over the 
wall. It felt solid to his touch. 
He stepped back and looked along 
the hall. There were the doors to 
the other three bedrooms, the 
bathroom, the attic stairs. But 
Lori’s door was sone. 

“Where is Lori?” 

Gillian shrank away from him 
as he came down the steps. 

“Jeff, you’re sick. You’re hav- 
ing some kind of attack. Lie down 
and I’ll call Dr. Everet — ” 

“I’ve never felt better in my 
life — 

Mallory broke off abruptly. 
Through the window on the land- 
ing he saw the familiar street, 
clear of fog now, the big old-fash- 
ioned houses, steep-gabled, the 
leafless trees above them. But be- 
yond, where the steeple of the 
Methodist Church should have 
been, a tower rose up and up into 
the morning sky. It was big, his 
engineer’s eye told him — hun- 
dreds of feet in diameter and so 



tall that its flaring top was lo» 
in the high haze. The material 
was pale green, glassy, translu* 
cent. An incredible structure had 
sprung up overnight like a u 
enchanted mushroom. 

“Gill — what is it?” 

She stared into his face. Her 
eyes had a glazed, remote look. 
“The Star Tower, of course.” • 
With an effort, Mallory spoke I 
calmly. j 

“Gill, something’s wrong. May- | 
be it's me. It must be me — 
unless I’m imagining that.” He 
stared at the tower. “And if I am, 
Tm still in trouble.” 

“You’ve been working too 
hard,” she said. “I knew you 
were working too hard.” 

“Gill, do you remember a 
church? The steeple used to stick 
up right behind the Meyer 
house — ” 

“But — that’s where the Tower 
is.” 

“No church? I imagined that?” 
“You saw the Tower, Jeft 
Surely you don’t — ” ! 

“I saw it. I admit it. That’s the i 
one thing that makes me think 1 1 
may be the one who’s out of his 
mind. Because the tower is im- 
possible, Gill.^’ Mallory laughed 
and was surprised at the weakness | 
of the laugh. “All right. I’m im- 
agining things. Anything else?” 
“You seem — very confused, 
Jeff.” 

“We don't have a nineteen- 
year-old daughter?” 

“No, Jeff.” 

“I don’t run my own engineer- 
ing company?” 

“I don’t understand what that 

IF 



98 




means. We work at our jobs at 
the Tower.” 

“What do you do in this work- 
room you say you have to hurry 
off to?” 

“We perform the tasks set us.” 
“What is it? Some sort of fac- 
tory?” 

“I — I don’t know. I suppose 
so. We — make things. Work on 
things. With wires. You work in 
the loading sheds.” 

“Gill — is this what it’s like 
to lose your mind? I feel per- 
fectly normal. No headache, no 
confusion. Just a lot of ideas that 
seem to be totally false. But how 
much of it is fise? Everything? 
No, not everything,” he shook his 
head. “You’re my wife. Gill. You 
know me. And the kids. Randy 
and Marla. But what about every- 
thing else?” he broke off, a vision 
of a flat earth filling his mind. 
“The world is round,” he said. 
“Okay so far?” 

She nodded hesitantly. 

“We live in the United States. 
In the state of Nebraska. The town 
of Beatrice.” 

Gill frowned. 

“No — this is the Center, Jeff.” 
“The center of what?” 

Gill made a vague gesture. “Of 
— everything. It’s just — the 
Center.” 

“What do we do?” 

“We work, we do our part.” 
“Our part of what?” 

“Of the work.” 

“Gill,” Mallory said. “I may 
be crazy — but I didn’t imagine 
Lori. She exists, damn it!” Pull- 
ing her behind him, he walked 
into the library. “Where’s the pic-- 

THE SEEDS OF GONYL 



ture of her that we keep on the 
desk?” 

Gill did not answer. 



H e took a blue album from 
the drawer. It held snap- 
shots of Gill, of himself, of Randy 
and Marly. But none of Lori, only 
patches of tom paper where pic- 
tures had been removed. 

“Who tore her pictures out?” 
Mallory gripped Gill’s arms, al- 
most shaking her. “Why?” 

“Please, Jeff — you’re hurting 
me — 7 

A soft click came from the 
direction of the front door. 

“Lori?” Mallory stepped past 
his wife, hurried through the 
arched entry to the front ipom — 
and stopped dead. 

A man stood there, staring 
fixedly past Mallory’s shoulder. 

Or — Mallory amended his 
first impression — not a man. 
Something that looked like a man. 
Something that mi^t fool you in 
a bad light or at a greater dis- 
tance. But not here, ten feet away, 
in the full light of morning. The 
face was the wrong color — a 
dusky purplish pink and of the 
texture of foam rubber. The eyes 
were dull, empty, without move- 
ment. The mouth and nostrils 
were sealed. The hair was a 
spongy mass. It was dressed in 
an dd-fashioned golfing outfit, 
baggy knickers, Argyle socks, a 
loose Cardigan of a pinkish gray 
color. 

Mallory’s thoughts reached this 
point, recoiled, approached, re- 
coiled.

“You are late, Worker,” a rich 
contralto voice sounded from the 
region of the simulacrum’s rib 
cage. 

Behind Mallory, Gill made a 
whimpering sound. 

“Gill — stay back.” 

Mallory took a step sideways 
and grabbed up the wrouglit-iron 
poker from beside the fireplace. 
The stand went over with a dull 
crash of iron. He hefted the two- 
foot bar, watching the thing as it 
pivoted to face him. 

From the corner of his eye 
Mallory saw Gill start past him. 
He put out an arm to stop her 
but she darted around him and 
toward the door. At once the mon- 
strosity moved to intercept her. 
Mallory swung up the poker, 
brought it down across its 
shoulder. The impact was as if 
he had struck padded steel. With 
a motion too quick to follow, the 
thing twitched the poker from his 
hand, dropped it carelessly on the 
rug. Gill had the door open, was 
standing there hesitantly, looking 
back. 

“Gill, run — ” 

Mallory launched himself at the 
creature. Iron hands gripped him, 
thrust him effortlessly away. 

“This is incorrect behavior. 
Worker,” the warm, feminine 
voice said in a tone of kindly 
correction. Mallory seized a heavy 
chair, hurled it at the thing, 
whirled and made a dash for the 
door through which Gill had dis- 
appeared. He had taken two steps 
when the room exploded into 
dazzling light that slowly faded 
into utter darkness. 



M allory became aware that 
he was lying on his back 
on a soft surface, looking up at 
a flower-patterned ceiling. He 
turned his head; an elderly man 
was sitting beside him. He recog- 
nized him: Doc Everet — George 
Everet. Everet was staring vaguely 
at the wall. 

“Where’s Gill?” Mallory asked. 
Everet turned, looked at Mal- 
lory’s left ear. 

“She had to go, Jeff. The work 
can’t wait, you know.” 

Mallory sat up. His head ached 
sickeningly. He looked around the 
room. The thing that had attacked 
him was gone. The fire tools were 
neatly racked beside the fireplace. 
The furniture was in its normal 
position. 

“Where has it gone?” he asked. 
“What was it, George?” 

“What?” 

“The thing — whatever it was. 
It knocked me out. Didn’t you 
see it? Didn’t Gill tell you?” 
“You fainted, Jeff. Gill told me 
of your attack.” 

Mallory strode to the window, 
twitched aside the curtain. The 
tower loomed behind the familiar 
roofs, impossibly tall, undeniably 
real. 

“Have I gone crazy?” he asked 
thickly. 

“Just a temporary loss of orien- 
tation,” the doctor said. “I have 
a tablet for you to take — ” 
“George — what’s going on?” 
Mallory came back to stare down 
at the other man. Everet’s thin 
white hair curled untrimmed about

jiis ears. A silvery stubble lin^ 
jiis cheeks. The collar of his shirt 
was grimy. His tie was tied in a 
hard, greasy knot. 

“Maybe you can tell me — 
where’s Lori? Gill acted as if she’d 
never heard of her, George.” 
Everet shook his head. 

“I know no one of that name.” 
“Don’t know her? Hell, George, 
you delivered her. Nineteen years 
ago.” 

“You have two children, Ran- 
dall and Marlene, Jeff. Their ages 
are eight and ten — ” 

“Certainly — and another, 
named Lori, age nineteen. She 
was born the year I started with 
Universal — the year after Gill 
and I were married, the year I 
first met you.” 

“Jeff, you have to reject these 
fantasies.” 

“Is that so fantastic?” 

“Worse than that. It’s nonsense. 
Many of the words you’re using 
are gibberish. They don’t mean 
anything.” 

“Which words?” 

“Never mind that. Put all that 
out of your mind.” 

“How can I? I want to know 
what’s going on. If I’m crazy, I 
want to know how crazy.” 

“Not crazy, just talking a little 
wild. I’m going to give you a pill 
that will make you sleep again.” 
“No. No pills. Just give me 
some facts. The Tower — how 
long has it been there? Who built 
it?” 

“Why, I suppose the Tower has 
been there since before I can re- 
member. Never thought much 
about it — ” 

THE SEEDS OF GONYL 



“A thing like that?” Mallory 
leaned forward tensely. “Doesn’t 
it strike you that it looks different 
Trom anything else in the town? 
It’s too high, too big. What is it 
built of? No materid I know of 
could take those stresses — ” 

“Jeff, stop exciting yourself.” 
Everet frowned, offered a spheri- 
cal purple capsule on his palm. 
“Take this. It wiU help you.” 

“Why not answer my ques- 
tion?” 

“Because next you’ll be asking 
me why trees have branches, 
where the leaves come from and 
what holds up the sky. I’m not 
here to help you concretize your 
delusion. Tallang about these fan- 
cies of yours will just stabilize 
them, make them seem more real 
to you. That’s not good, is it? We 
want you well, sane, back on the 
job. Now take this. Or would you 
rather have the needle?” 

Jeff accepted the pill, took the 
glass of water Everet offered. The 
elderly doctor watched h i m 
swallow. 

“Now, lie back and relax. 
Don’t think about these notions 
of yours. Just be glad you’ve got 
a fine home, a fine wife, two 
fine children and that you have 
your Work. I’ll look in on you 
this evening. By tomorrow morn- 
ing you’ll be feeling better, much 
better.” 

Mallory nodded, let his eyes 
close. He listened to the sounds 
of Everet closing his bag, tiptoe- 
ing across the room, die door 
opening, closing, the click of the 
latch. 

He waited a full minute, then 

101 




sat up, tossed the pill he had 
palmed into the fireplace. 

“Delusions, eh?'' he muttered. 
“We'll check on that." 

H e found the axe among the 
garden tools under the base- 
ment steps. Back upstairs, he 
studied the blank wall where the 
door to Lori’s room had been. 
Was there a faint, irregular line, 
an almost imperceptible discon- 
tinuity in the surface of the plas- 
ter? He could not be sure. But 
there was a way to find out. He 
raised the axe, swung it at the 
wall. 

It struck with a solid thunk 
that jarred his arms to the sockets. 
Plaster cracked and fell away, ex- 
posing a gray, papery surface. He 
chopped at it, knocking pieces 
loose. It was light, tough stuff, 
like the material of a hornet’s nest. 
A fragment broke loose and fell 
inward. Dim light shone out 
the hole. Mallory kneeled, saw the 
corner of a bed, a rug, a papered 
wall and a window, the shade 
drawn tightly over it. 

“Nothing there, eh?" He at- 
tacked the wall again, enlarged 
the opening, crawled through it. 
He was in Lori’s room. 

Dust lav thick on the dresser 
and bedside table. Papers and 
books were scattered on the desk. 
He opened the closet door. Lori’s 
clothes hung — dusty — on 
hangers. He touched a pale blue 
sweater that Gill had civen their 
dauehter on her last birthday. 

“Lori," he whispered. “Where 
are you?" 

His eyes fell on a thin-spined 



book lying on a shelf — a higli 
school Annual. He picked it up, 
leafed through to the pages where 
photographs were ranked in rows. 
Her picture was there among the 
others, blond and smiling. He tore 
it out, folded it, put it into his 
shirt pocket. 

He left the room, stepping over 
the litter of plaster in the hall, 
automatically careful not to walk ‘ 
on it and grind plaster into the 
carpet. 

Start at the top, he told him- 
self. Check the whole house. See \ 
what else is phony about this situ-^ 
ation. 

The attic looked as it always 
had. Long rays of early sun 
slanted through the dusty window 
on worn carpet, ancient trunks, 
rickety cardboard cartons filled 
w i t h u n able-to-be-parted-with 
mementoes of past lives; on 
broken toys, the old brass stand- 
ing lamps and faded velour fur- 
niture. An old frontier Colt .44 
hung on a peg. He lifted it down. 
There were corroded cartridges in 
the belt. No way of knowing if 
they would fire. The gun had not 
been used in twenty years. He 
loaded it, buckled it on. 

Room by room he checked the 
rest of the house. Everything 
looked normal, though dusty. The 
beds were untidily made. Pantry 
shelves were crowded with ranked 
boxes of soap flakes, detergent, 
cases of dog food, paper napkins 
— Gill hated them — dietetic 
fruits, canned hominy and sweet 
potatoes. On the back porch were 
stacked more cartons. 

He found a diminished bottle 

IF 



102 




of scotch, poured himself four 
ounces, neat. The liquor seemed 
to clear his head a bit. But his 
body still felt numbed. Like a 
thumb in the instant after the 
hammer hits it and before the real 
pain arrives. On the curled cal- 
endar on the wall, the days of 
November had been x-ed out 
through the fifteenth. 

H e went into the living 
room, looked out through 
the glass curtains. The orderly 
street was silent. A few cars were 
visible, parked in driveways or at 
the curb. They looked a little 
dusty, as if they had been sitting 
for some time. 

Dead leaves lay drifted across 
the sidewalks and the street in a 
pattern undisturbed by traffic. He 
went to the telephone in the hall, 
lifted the receiver, listened to the 
steady hum of the dial tone. He 
dialed O, waited through twenty- 
five rings before he hung up. 

He switched on the console TV. 
Static crackled from the speaker 
after half a minute. He tuned. A 
dancing grid of light blanked all 
channels. 

He took a coat fr<»n the front 
closet, went to the back door and 
looked out at the garden. Morn- 
ing sunshine lay across dormant 
flower beds, le^ess shrubs, dry 
grass. A bird twittered in the 
hedge. He left the bouse, walked 
quickly back to the garage. The 
door was locked. His two-year- 
old Buick w^ visiHe through the 
window. One front tire seemed al- 
most flat. 

Keeping to the shrub line, he 

the seeds of GONYL 



crossed to the rear of the Bartlett 
garden. The house stood high and 
silent in the morning light. He 
found a broken window on the 
ground floor. A light breeze blew 
a scrap of -paper across the dry 
grass. Green shoots poked up 
through the black earth beside the 
walk. The daffodils would be 
blossoming in a few more weeks. 

Mallory strode toward the back 
door, almost expecting to see Meg 
Bartlett appear there, plump and 
aproned, to wave and invite him 
in for coffee. 

A wrongness in something he 
had seen nagged at him. He 
stopped and looked back. 

Daffodils. 

Daffodils did not appear until 
March — late February at the 
earliest. This was November. Or 
had time jumped ahead from 
autumn to spring overnight? 

Three months lost, . 

What had happened during 
those ninety days? 

He did not know. He could not 
remember. 

He walked along the drive, 
opened an unlatched screen and 
rapped on the door. He heard 
no response and started around 
to the front of the house. 

A heap of old clothes lay in 
the drive. He moved closer, saw 
Aat what remained of a man was 
in the clothes, talonlike hands 
clawing at the earth. Skull-face, 
leather covered, teeth bared in a 
yellow grin. He recognized the 
curly gray hair — Fr^ Bartlett, 
his neighbor of ten years. 

Mallory skirted the mummy, 
went on to the front of the house. 

103 





He started off along the side- 
walk in the sparse sh^e of the 
barren trees. Tall weeds grew 
across once-immaculate lawns. 
Formerly shiny cars sat on soft 
tires, their windows opaque with 
dust. Halfway down the block the 
bay windows of a brick house 
gaped black and gutted. 

Clabbered milk bottles stood on 
porches. Forlorn yellowed en- 
velopes poked from mail boxes. A 
dead dog lay in the gutter, partly 
covered with leaves, snarling a 
dessicated snarl. Above the roof- 
tops the faerie tower loomed 
against the blue sky. 

The school was in the next 
block. Mallory crossed the silent 
playground where papers blew 
across hard-baked earth. He en- 
tered the building. 

The doors were unlocked — 
his footsteps were an intrusion on 
utter silence. He poked along, 
looking at the placards marking 
the doors. He recognized the 
name of Randy’s teacher. The 
door stood ajar. Papers were 
scattered over the floor. A chalk 
mural cm the blackboard was 
spotty and streaked. A dead ger- 
anium stood stiffly in a painted 
clay pot Paper turkeys and pil- 
grims’ heads which had b^n 
pasted to the windows had cxwne 
loose and lay on the flcmr among 
other clutter. On the desk that 
Mallory remembered as Randy’s 
lay a battered geography hook. 

The children were not here — 
had not been here for some time. 






T WAS Strange to see the down- 
town streets deserted under the 





cold mid-moming sun. Two empty 
cars, their front wheels inter- 
locked in a tangle of metal, 
blocked the intersection. 

A broken window featured the 
liquor store in the next block. A 
few bottles lay scattered in the 
display window among glass 
shards — otherwise the stock 
seemed undisturbed. Mallory 
started at a sharp click — then 
saw that the traffic lights were 
still working. 

The street ended three blocks 
ahead in a blank wall of dull 
black material. 

Mallory walked on slowly. The 
wall was five feet high, running 
across pavement and lawns, curv- 
ing away to both sides, shearing 
through the houses lying in its 
path. There was no ruft)le, no 
disorder — but he could see ex- 
posed wallpaper, pictures hang- 
ing above b^s in rooms slic^ 
open like dolls’ houses. The tower 
stood two hundred yards beyond 
the wall, its outlines vague as a 
rainbow. The twenty-acre circle 
of flat ground enclosed by the 
wall was as bare and featureless 
as a concrete slab. There were no 
visible openings in the tower. 

A faraway siren whooped. 

Mallory retreated to the near- 
est house, flattened himself against 
the wall in the shelter of a cluster 
of cedars. A section of the wall 
swung back, gatelike. The head 
of a loose column of people 
emerged from the enclosure. 
There were men, women, child- 
ren. They walked briskly, not 
talking, streaming out through the 
gates and off ^ong the street. 

105 



THE SEEDS OF GONYL 




Many were incongruously clothed. 
A middle-aged woman with un- 
kempt hair walked barefoot in a 
tom and dirt-streaked formal 
evening gown. Nearby, a round- 
shouldered man stumped along, 
hugging himself in a stained bath- 
robe. One man limped on shoes 
that had worn completely through, 
so that the loose uppers flapped 
about his ankles. All the people 
looked rumpled, bedraggled, 
threadbare, uniformly thin-faced, 
lean, some to the point of emaci- 
ation. They looked, Mallory 
thought, like concentration-camp 
victims marching toward the gas 
ovens. But Gillian was not among 
them — nor were his children. 

T he main body passed, fol- 
lowed by a few stragglers. 
A lone man brought up the rear, 
trailing fifty feet behind the 
others. He approached Mallory’s 
hiding place. Mallory went for- 
ward to intercept him. The man 
did not look up or halt. Mallory 
fell into step b^ide him. 

“Just a minute, if you don’t 
mind, Mr. Zwicker,’’ he said. “I’d 
like to talk to you.” 

“Mallory, isn’ it?” The man 
shot him a keen look. He was an 
ordinary-looking fellow of middle 
age, a builder, a customer of Mal- 
lory’s firm. He looked thinner 
than Mallory remembered. “Have 
to hurry along,” Zwicker said, 
“No time to waste.” 

“Listen,” Mallory said, “have 
you seen my family? You remem- 
ber my wife. Gill — ” 

“I’ve done my quota,” Zwicker 
said. “And now I’m going home 

106 



as always to nourish myself and 
rest — ” 

Mallory caught his arm, spun 
him around. 

“Is she in there?” 

He nodded toward the tower 
that loomed over them like a 
cliff. Zwicker tried to pry Mal- 
lory’s fingers from his arm. 

“You weren’t on the docks to- 
day,” he said accusingly. “I re- 
member — the Watcher found your 
place empty. That’s bad, Mallory. 
How can we accomplish the Work 
if each doesn’t do his share — ” 
“Have you seen her? Answer 
me, danm you.” 

“No. No, I haven’t. My work 
is on the docks. I see no women, 
not even — ” Zwicker paused 
frowning. “I must go home,” he 
said flafly and tried again to pull 
away. 

“What goes on inside there?” 
Mallory demanded. 

“In the Star Tower?” Zwicker 
tugged, prying at Mallory’s fingers. 
“We carry on the Work, of 
course.” 

“What work?” 

Zwicker looked sharply at him. 
“You’re acting like a crazy man, 
accosting me in the street, asking 
wild questions — ” 

“How long has it been there 
— the Tower?” 

Zwicker looked at him blankly. 
“Why — forever, I suppose” 
he said. “What a curious ques- 
tion.” 

“Zwicker, this is all wrong. I 
want to know what’s happened.” 
“Nothing whatever,” Swicker 
yelped, “llie sun is shining, night 
follows day, we do our Work — 

IF 




all but you. Why are you ques- 
tioning me? Why are you trying 
to make trouble?” 

The man’s eyes slid -past Mal- 
lory. Their expression changed, 
became vague. Mallory turned. A 
flat cart had rolled through the 
gate on silent doughnut wheels. On 
it squatted two creatures like the 
one that had invaded his living 
room. 

tt\X7ell, I must be on my 
VV way,” Zwicker said jaun- 
tily. “Nice seeing you, Mallory — ” 

“Zwicker, for God’s sake, what 
are those things?” 

Zwicker shot him a frown. 

“Mallory, you make me un- 
comfortable — ” 

The cart was rolling closer. 
Mallory thrust Zwicker toward a 
gap between the bumpers of 
parked cars. 

“Through there — run,” he 
snapped. 

Zwicker planted his feet, re- 
sisting. 

“Mallory, let me go — ” 

The cart was approaching 
swiftly, making a soft, humming 
sound. It was too late now to run 
for it. 

“Quick — into the car.” Mal- 
lory yanked a door open, thrust 
Zwicker in, slid under the wheel. 

“Keep down,” he whispered as 
Zwicker lunged for the door 
handle. 

Zwicker yelled. Mallory swift- 
ly clapped a hand over his mouth. 
Zwicker kicked out frantically. 
Mallory hit him on the side of 
the jaw. Zwicker went limp. 

Mallory quickly locked the 



doors, tried the starter. He heard 
a heavy click, nothing more. 

The hum of the cart had grown 
louder. Now it descended the 
decibel scale and ceased. Mallory 
watched the two not-men step 
down from the cart, moving effi- 
ciently but somehow wrongly, 
with a subtle distortion of normal 
human rhythm and balance. 

They came to the car, stood 
staring in at him through the 
glass. One wore a tuxedo with a 
pink carnation in the lapel. The 
other was in a blue coverall \iith 
the name Herb stitched over the 
pocket. 

The latter reached for the door 
handle — the car shook as it 
tugged. The other sprang lightly 
to the hood, reached back out of 
Mallory’s line of vision. There 
was a sharp ripping sound and 
something sha^ sliced down 
through top and headliner, cut a 
yard-long incision. A parallel cut 
appeared an instant later. 

Mallory shook Zwicker, who 
pulled away mumbling. Mallory 
opened the door, thrust it wide, 
dived, struck shoulder first, rolled, 
came to his feet and sprinted for 
a gap in the hedge. 

“Halt,” a resonant voice boom- 
ed after him. 

He cut across a stretch of leaf- 
strewn lawn, followed the curve 
of a graveled drive leading toward 
a colonnaded, white house. He 
heard the shrill whine of the flat- 
car as it maneuvered swiftly, 
coming in along the drive. 

There was another sound — a 
thinner, more piercing tone. Pain 
lashed at Mallory. He stumbled 

107 



THE SEEDS OF GONYL 




headlong toward the trees that 
lined the way, bounced off the 
trunk of an ancient elm, went 
down hard. On his knees he 
crawled into the shelter of a line 
of low-spreading junipers. He 
heard the flatcar slow to a stop. 
Next came sharp clicks and rasp- 
ing sounds, then voices. 

“I don’t know,” Zwicker’s thin 
tenor was saying. “I only want to 
go to my home, take nourishment 
and rest — ” 

“It is necessary for the highest 
good that you give this informa- 
tion,” a warm, fatherly voice cut 
in. “Why did the other Worker 
accost you?” 

“I don’t know. I only want — ” 

“It will be necessary to give 
pain until you remember,” the 
kindly voice said. 

Zwicker’s voice broke into a 
scream that ended in a whimper, 

“The runaway worker is dam- 
aged,” another voice said, this one 
a bright young executive type. 
“There are stains of ichor on the 
husk of the tree.” 

“He will be found,” a society 
matron gushed. 

Mallory heard sounds of multi- 
ple limbs moving across gravel, 
crunching dry leaves. He rose 
to his feet and, keeping to the 
shelter of trees, retreated past the 
comer of the house. Then he 
ran. 

M allory covered three 
blocks, cutting across 
dead lawns, pushing tlu-ough brit- 
tle hedges without seeing any signs 
of life, human or alien. He dro^ 
ped to the ground to recover his 

108 



breath. In the silence he heard 
the whine of a flatcar. 

It came closer, stopped near- 
by. Soft, clattering sounds advanc- 
ing along the driveway reached 
him. Mallory unholstered the 
heavy gun, cocked it, leveled it 
along the drive. An alien ap- 
peared, limbs flickering in minc- 
ing steps. Mallory took aim at 
the center of the body, pulled the 
stiff trigger. 

At the solid clack the alien 
halted, pivoted swiftly, came to- 
ward him. He pulled the trigger 
again, double-action — 

The boom almost kicked the 
gun from his hand. The alien was 
on its back, limbs scything air. 
Mallory came to his feet as a 
second creature appeared at the 
foot of the drive. 

“Worker, halt!” a boyish vcrice 
called in a tone of warm con- 
gratulation. 

Mallory fired and, without 
waiting to see the effect, ran for 
the alley behind the house. 

Less than a block later he knew 
he had made a mistake. His wind 
was gone. His legs ached. His 
head was swinuning. The three 
lost months had robbed him of 
his conditioning. 

A garage — once a stable — 
fronted on an alley ahead, its 
door secured by a massive, rusty 
padlock. Malloi^ staggered to a 
halt, steadied himself, fired twice 
into the lock: The noise of the 
gun racketed deafeningly between 
the hedge-rows. He twisted the 
shattered mechanism from the 
heavy hasp, hurled the door wide. 

A late-model convertible sat in 



IF 




the gloom. Two bright-edged holes 
marred the smooth curve of the 
deck lid where his shots had pen- 
etrated. He pulled the door open, 
slid into the seat, twisted the key. 
After an instant’s hesitation, the 
starter ground over sluggishly. 
He pumped the gas pedal. 
Abruptly the engine caught, bark- 
ed, roared to life. Mallory slam- 
med the car into reverse, backed 
out, cutting hard. He gunned 
forward to the street, swung left, 
caught a glimpse of the flatcar in 
the middle of the street, one alien 
squatting on it, another moving 
toward it. 

He floored the gas pedal, hit 
sixty into the next block. A strong 
odor of gasoline blew past his 
face. The engine bucked, surged, 
sputtered, stopped. As the car 
coasted to a halt a cart bearing 
three aliens rolled into view 
around the comer a block and a 
half ahead. 

Mallory vaulted over the side, 
crawled backward, keeping low. 
He gained the shelter of a hedge. 
The cart rolled to a halt beside 
the car. Two aliens scrambled 
down, approached the stalled ve- 
hicle. When they were beside it, 
Mallory took out his cigarette 
lighter, fired it, tossed it toward 
the dark puddle forming under 
the bullet-punctured gas tank. 

An explosive whump followed 
and fire boomed up to envelop 
the car in roaring heat. An alien 
ran across to the left, burning 
from heels to crown, leaving fiery 
footprints across the dead grass. 
It disappeared between the houses. 

Mallory jumped up, ran toward 

THE SEEDS OF GONYL 



the big frame house. He heard a 
harsh buzz and the lawn ahead 
and to his left exploded into roil- 
ing dust. He veer^ onto the grav- 
el^ drive. As he approached 
the comer of the house it burst 
in a whine of flying splinters. A 
spike caught him, sent him 
spinning. 

He was only partly conscious 
of struggling to his feet, stumbling 
toward the broached wall. He 
pulled himself up and through the 
opening into the gloom of a cur- 
tained living room. The bast had 
brought down plaster, filled the 
air with swirling dust. Mallory 
made his way past a toppled pur- 
ple divan, stepped over a framed 
picture fallen from the wall, was 
in a dark hallway. Stairs led up- 
ward. 

He mounted them one at a time 
as if he were carrying a heavy 
burden. Behind him he heard soft 
clacking and scraping — one of 
the aliens was entering the house 
through the same opening he had 
used. 

He reached for the gun, felt 
only the empty holster. He knew 
a fiery pain in his left arm, just 
below the shoulder. 

In the upper hall he halted, 
breathing hard. A high humming 
filled his head. He could hear 
the alien moving about below. 
There was a closet door beside 
him. With a half-formed thought 
of hiding, he opened it. It was 
crowded with cardboard cartons, 
garments, loose articles — tennis 
rackets, a pair of water skis, scuba 
tanks, a spear gun. 

Mallory eased the lightweight 

109 




weapon from its place. Two steel 
tube darts were clipped in a re- 
tainer below the guide channel. 
He held the gun between his 
knees, dropped the dart into the 
slot. Then, bracing the butt of the 
stock against his thigh, he 
cranked back the spring-loaded 
cocking lever. It caught with a 
sharp snick and at once the 
sounds from below ceased. 

They resumed — a rhythmic 
rasp, click — rasp, click. Mallory 
braced himself against the wall, 
the spear gun leveled at the head 
of the stairs, ten feet away. The 
head of the creature appeared, 
then the upper body, dressed in 
a flowered Aloha shirt. It saw 
him, paused at the head of the 
stairs. He aimed at the middle 
shirt button and pulled the trigger. 

There was a sharp thwack of 
the mechanism, the stiff jolt of 
the recoil. Six inches of bright 
steel stood quivering against the 
bright - patterned chest. Mal- 
lory realized quite suddenly that 
the shirt was not a garment — 
it was a part of the not-man’s 
body, molded with it. 

For a full five seconds neither 
Mallory nor the alien moved. 
Then the creatured stirred, leaned 
sideways, took quick, tiny steps as 
if to catch its balance. Its legs 
folded bonelessly. With a jarring 
series of impacts it tumbled 
backward down the stairs. 

T he electric clock on the wall 
hummed loudly. Some- 
where in the house a board 
creaked. Mallory felt a hot trickle 
across his left hand. His sleeve 



was wet, heavy as a plaster cast. 
Blackness welled inside him. His 
head felt huge and hot. His arm 
burned with a dull fire. 

He skirted the dead thing at 
the foot of the steps, went on into 
the living room, peered out past 
the edge of the drawn curtains 
at the empty road. No people 
were in sight. He saw no aliens, 
no movement except the restless 
stir of the unpruned shrubbery 
below the window. 

It took him an hour to search 
the house. He found another 
corpse in an upstairs bedroom, a 
woman with gray hair. He found 
a drawer that held a .22 auto- 
matic pistol. He took it and a 
box of hollow-point shells. The 
medicine cabinet in the bathroom 
yielded iodine, aspirin, a roll of 
gauze. Back in the kitchen, he 
drew the blinds, lit the gas range 
for heat and light. He got a 
pan of warm water, remov^ the 
bandages from his arm, carefully 
washed the wounds. Splinters were 
bedded deep in his flesh. He with- 
drew one, starting fresh bleeding. 
He used a heavy linen napkin 
from the sideboard to bind the 
arm, then ripped a tablecloth to 
form a sling. 

He checked the refrigerator. It 
was still running but the butter 
and cheese and vegetables were 
mounds of dessicat^ corruption. 
A small steak in the freezer unit 
had remained edible. He found a 
skillet, put it on the gas, opened 
cans of peas and corn. He ate 
sitting at the table, forcing him- 
self not to think of Gill, of what 
might have happened to her, the

children. Were they at home now? 

They had survived for three 
months. They’d be all right for a 
little longer. They had to be all 
right. Going back now would not 
help them. He had to get clear 
of Beatrice, find help, come back 
with force behind him. 

A thing like this could not be 
a secret. Alien invasion had been 
talked about for a century but had 
never really been considered a 
possibility. And now it was here. 
Why weren’t the Army and the 
Air Force hitting back? 

Good reasons probably existed 
but without information he could 
not hope to deduce them. The 
facts he had were meager. He had 
been a Worker, like everyone ' 
else, that was cl^r enough from 
his clothes, the calluses on his 
hands and from what Gill and 
Zwicker had said. But something 
had brought him out of the trance- 
like state that gripped the others. 
What? How was he different? 

He tried to remember the last 
days. Early November certainly 
was clear enough. The tenth — he 
remembered that. There had been 
the quarterly payment on the plant 
mortgage. He remembered signing 
the check. All right, that narrowed 
it down. Then what? There had 
been the conference with the 
chain-store clients. That had been 
on a Monday. 

Mallory found a wall calendar. 
Monday had fallen on the seven- 
teenth and the twenty-fourth. 
Which had it been? There had 
been something — a trip, a visit 
to the parent company’s home of- 

THE SEEDS OF GONYL 



fice, up north. He had planned to 
drive, because — of what? 

The reason had had some- 
thing to do with the Old House 
— he had meant to take the op- 
portunity to stop by, check on 
things. 

Abruptly he was thinking of 
Lori. He remembered that he had 
invited her to go along on the 
trip. But she had had other plans 
— a visit to a friend who lived 
outside the city. 

Hodges. Sally Hodges. The 
Hodges house was about twelve 
miles out on the state road. Lori 
had been there when the aliens 
came. That was why she was not 
at home, had not been caught 
with the others. She was safe. 
Safe. And tomorrow he would 
find her. 

The stairs were too steep for 
him to climb again. Mallory 
settled himself in a chair in the 
living room, covered himself with 
a throw rug, and slept. 

D uring the next day flatcars 
twice passed close to 
the house. Mallory watched them 
from an upstairs window. Their 
occupants showed no interest in 
the house. He slept, ate. By night- 
fall he felt well enough to travel. 
He donned a fleece-lined coat he 
had found in the hall closet, filled 
the pockets with canned goods 
and dried fruit, bottled soda wa- 
ter. 

He left via the back door, 
crossed the untended garden. He 
was dizzy and lightheaded but his 
legs felt as if they would support 
him for a while.

A hundred yards from his 
starting point, a bumed-out tank 
rested on its side in the ditch. So 
the Army had fought — and lost. 
He plodded on, head down against 
the chill wind, headed north into 
the dark countryside. 

Ill 

M allory remembered the 
Hodges house as a pleasant 
old brick structure, steep-roofed, 
gingerbread trimmed, built among 
century-old elms at the crest of 
a low hill half a mile off the 
highway. It looked gaunt and for- 
bidding in the pale dawnlight 
when he crawled over the fence 
and crossed the pasture. 

He saw lights in two of the 
windows. 

He approached the house 
openly via the driveway. No one 
moved behind the curtains. No 
eager farm dogs leaped forth to 
bark a greeting. Three pick-up 
trucks were parked on the rutted 
grass before the wide porch. A 
heavy-laden convertible stood be- 
hind them. The lights inside went 
out as Mallory reached the steps. 

He halted. Air sighed through 
tree branches overhead. A stick 
cracked somewhere in the dark- 
ness off the left side of the house. 

“Hello — anybody there?” 
Mallory called. 

No one answered. He thought 
he heard a faint sound that might 
have been the hammer of a gun 
coming back to full cock. 

“I’m a refugee from the city,” 
he said. “I need help.” 

The bushes shook. A big, 



broad, rather heavy-looking man 
stepped into view, holding a shot- 
gun ready. 

“Get down on your knees and 
put your hands on the ground,” 
he ordered brusquely. 

“I’m unarmed,” Mallory said. 

“Better move fast. I’d as soon 
blow your guts out as look at ye.” 

Mallory stared at the loose- 
mouthed, unshaven face, the 
bristly black hair tufted under the 
rim of a new-looking yachting cap 
with an elaborate gold badge. 

“Don’t be a fool,” he said. 

“You’re a spy.” The man 
fingered the gun, ‘coming forward 
slowly. “A damned, sneaking 
spy.” 

“Lx>nny, you damn fool — 
Can’t you see he’s hurt?” 

A woman, heavy-hipped, bun- 
dlesome in a mackinaw, had come 
up behind the man. 

“He’ll hurt some more before 
I’m done with him — ” 

“Sure, shoot off that twelve- 
gauge and let everybody inside 
five miles know we’re here.” 

“I’ll just stomp him.” 

Lonny advanced, his teeth 
showing white in the pearly light. 

“Has it occured to you that we 
need every man we can find?” a 
quiet, elderly voice said from the 
background. 

Lonny thumbed the safety off, 
squinted down the barrel at Mal- 
lory’s face. 

“Where’s Frank Hodges?” Mal- 
lory asked. 

Lonny lowered the gun, grin- 
ning. 

“I forgot,” he said. “1 aimed 
to stomp ye.”

A girl appeared behind the big 
man. She was young, pretty, with 
a pale, big-ey^ face, dark hair 
tied under a scarf. 

“It’s Mr. Mallory,” she gasped. 
She came forward. “Mr. Mallory 
^ how — what — ” 

Lonny’s big hand caught her, 
pushed her roughly away. 

“Lonny, I told you to keep your 
hands off her,” she snapped. “And 
you can forget about busting this 
fellow.” She tilted her head to- 
ward Mallory. “Sally knows him, 
that’s plain. And like the Perfes- 
sor said, we can use an extra 
hand here.” 

“He could still be a spy,” 
Lonny snorted. 

But he stood by passively as 
the big woman and the girl led 
Mallory into the house. 



A fire glowed in the fireplace, 
a kerosene lamp on the 
table. The girl brought a tray with 
hot soup and coffee to Mallory 
as he sat at the kitchen table. 

“Lori was here when it started,” 
she said. “Then men came here — 
soldiers. They shot father. Lori 
and I got away into the woods. 
We were separated. I haven’t seen 
her since.” 

“How long ago?” 

“We were together for a week. 
So it’s been about three months. 
She was all right when I saw her 
last. The soldiers were gone when 
I came back. The house was 
empty. I don’t know where Moth- 
er is.” 

“Sally — what are the — the 

the seeds of GONYL 



diings in the city? Where do they 
come from?” 

Sally looked puzzled. 

“I don’t know what you mean.” 
The Professor came into the 
room. He was a gray-haired, wor- 
ried-looking man wrapped in a 
muffler. The tip of his nose was 
red with cold. 

“You spoke of ‘things’ in town, 
sir,” he said. “You refer to the 
enemy troops, I assume?” 
Mallory described the simul- 
acra. Sally and the old man lis- 
tened silently. 

“They have a kind of hypnotic 
control over the people who 
work for them,” Mallory finished. 
“They walk and talk and feed 
themselves — but that’s about all.” 
“You say you worked for the, 
ah, creatures for three months?” 
“I must have. I have no mem- 
ory of it.” 

“Why is it you weren’t affected 
by this hypnosis you speak of?” 
“I assume I was affected — 
for a while. Then I came out of 
it.” 

“Why?” 

“I don’t know.” 

The Professor nodded. 

“You’ve had a difficult time of 
it. You need rest and care — ” 
“You don’t believe me.” 

“I have no doubt you’re quite 
sincere, sir, but it’s apparent 
you’ve suffered hallucinations. It’s 
not surprising, considering what 
you’ve been through, alone with 
your dead in the ruins of a de- 
serted city — ” 

“It’s not deserted and it’s not 
in ruins. It’s been taken over. My 
facts are easy enough to check. 

113 




But where are the Army and the 
police? Why isn’t anyone doing 
anything?” 

“There’s been a war,” the eld- 
erly man said coolly. “A short 
war — one the United States failed 
to win. The country has been in- 
vaded. We’re under occupation by 
Soviet troops.” 



T he elderly man, whose name 
was Jarvis and who was a 
general practitioner from the near- 
by town of Minneapolis, Nebras- 
ka, pulled up a chair and tamped 
tobacco into a clay pipe. 

“I can’t help wondering what 
you did in the city these last 
months, Mr. Mallory. How did 
you survive?” 

“I’ve already told you, Dr. Jar- 
vis,” Mallory said. 

“Your story still sounds reason- 
able to you in the light of what 
I’ve said?” 

“I didn’t say it sounded reason- 
able. Just that it’s true.” 

“Mr. Mallory — you’ve elab- 
orated a fantasy to spare yourself 
the shame of defeat by the Com- 
munists — to give yourself hope 
that your wife and children are 
merely captives, rather than dead.” 
“I know what I saw.” 

“Have you any proof?” 

“Why would I concoct such a 
story?” 

“We’ve all been through a ter- 
rible experience,” Jarvis said soft- 
ly. “Some of us survived in one 
way, some in another. Some by 
physical flight, some by a fugue 
of another sort.” 

“We’re only twelve miles from 



Beatrice. Haven’t any of you ven- 
tured near enough to see that the 
city’s intact?” 

“There’s an epidemic there, Mr. 
Mallory.” 

“What about the Tower? You 
should be able to see it from 
here.” 

“Tower?” 

“It’s half a mile high, lumin- 
ous green.” 

Jarvis raised his wispy eye- 
brows. 

“You mean the searchlight?” 

“I mean the tower. They’ve 
cleared away the houses in a 
quarter-mile radious around it. It’s 
their headquarters. That’s where 
the workroom is, where Gillian 
is.” 

“Mr. Mallory, the Russians 
have ^et up a big beacon light in 
the city,” Sally said diffidently. 
“You can s^ee it shining at night.” 

“The light is invisible in the 
daylight, of course,” Jarvis said. 

“You’ve got an answer for 
everything.” 

“Tell me, sir — since your 
awakening, as you put it, have 
you yourself had any doubts as 
to the reality of what you saw?” 

“Of course I had doubts. Who 
wouldn’t? The aliens aren’t easy 
to believe in even when you’ve 
seen one. But after they’ve shot 
at you — they’re hard to ignore.” 

“You had no gunshot wound, 
Mr. Mallory. Only lacerations, ap- 
parently caused by a piece of 
wood. There were splinters in the 
wounds. I suspect you had a fall, 
probably in a damaged house. 
Looking back, can you see any 
small discrepancies, any objects

or creatures that changed their 
aspect from time to time? Any- 
thing miraculous, logically impos- 
sible?” , ^ 

“The door to Lori’s room,” 
Mallory said reluctantly. “It was 
sealed over. I had to cut my way 
in with an axe.” 

“I submit that you sealed away 
your memory of your lost daugh- 
ter, Mr. Mallory. But behind a 
mental barrier, not one of lath 
and plaster.” 

“I tell you I chopped my way 
through it. It was solid — but 
not lath and plaster. It was like 
layers of gray tissue paper.” 
“I’m sure all these symbolisms 
would be significant to a trained 
psychiatrists,” Jarvis said. “I’m no 
more than an amateur dabbler in 
the subject — but I’ve done a 
bit of reading. I feel sure that if 
you returned to your house — as- 
suming you weren’t haunting a 
ruin — you’d find a perfectly nor- 
mal door shattered to splinters by 
your axe. In fact — ” Jarvis’ 
tone grew minutely animated. 
“That may be precisely how you 
acquired the wounds, forcing your 
way in — ” 

“Next you’ll be telling me Lori 
doesn’t exist. That’s what Gill 
said. But Sally knows her. Ex- 
plain that away.” 

“I’m sure your fantasy is built 
on some basis of facts. I’m merely 
trying to help you strip away the 
facade of illusion — ” 

“Maybe you shouldn’t, Dr. Jar- 
vis,” Sally said. “Maybe he’s bet- 
ter off believing — something.” 
Jarvis looked skeptical. 
“Believing in alien monsters? I 

THE SEEDS OF GONYL 



doubt that concept will prove to 
be more comforting in the long 
run than the reality that the Rus- 
sians launched a surprise attack 
and won the war.” 

“They haven’t really won,” 
Sally said. “They must be as badly 
off as we are. I haven’t seen a 
Russian soldier in months. And 
they haven’t bothered us here. Not 
since the first day.” 

“We’re too close to the plague 
city. And in any event — what 
do we have that they might want? 
They have the cities to loot. But 
they’ll get around to us in time, 
I daresay.” 

“Have you actually seen these 
Russians?” Mallory asked. “Are 
you sure you’re not making them 
up?” 

“Of course I’ve seen them. 
Paratroopers dropping out of the 
sky. There was heavy fighting 
south- of Minneapolis — that was 
why I ran away.” 

“I saw them, too, as close as 
you are,” Sally . said. “I’ll never 
forget them, those baggy uni- 
forms and the captain with his 
red shoulder boards — and their 
strange smell, the language they 
spoke — ” 

“Don’t reopen the wound.” 
Jarvis patted her shoulder. “You 
promised not to think of all that, 
eh?” 

“Why here?” Mallory asked. 
“What military objective is there 
in Nebraska?” 

“Possibly some secret base, a 
missile site — who knows?” 

“What does the radio say about 
all this? Television? Isn’t there 
any news?” 

1 15 




“No news. No television. The 
radio comes alive now and then, 
mostly in Russian. I’m afraid I 
don’t understand the language.” 

The back door banged open. 
Lonny, coming in from outside 
with an armload of firewood, 
stared at Malloiy. He thrust the 
door shut with his foot and dump- 
ed the wood on the floor. 

“Carry that into the fireplace,” 
he ordered. “Then go out there 
and cut more.” 

“Not with that arm, Lonny,” 
Jarvis spoke up. 

The heavy woman, Mae, ap- 
peared at that point to second 
him. Lonny went away, mutter- 
ing. 

“I suggest you mend as quickly 
as possible,” the medical man ad- 
vis^ Mallory. “Our Lonny is a 
hypochondriac, he tends to toler- 
ate me for that reason. But he’s 
also one of the laziest men alive. 
He even tried to force Sally to 
chop the wood for him.” 

“Lonny ain’t so bad, when you 
know how to handle him,” Mae 
said, sitting down heavily across 
from Mallory and tucking back a 
lock of graying hair. “He ain’t 
right bri^t and he’s yeller — so 
he’s gotta be bullied. But he ain’t 
no more’n a big overgrowed kid 
in some ways.” 

A fter eating, Mallory and 
Sally went out into the yard. 
The bam door hung in pieces from 
its hinges, shattered by some win- 
ter storm. No animus were in 
sight. The place had a forlorn, 
decayed air. A season of neglect 
had done more to destroy the 



image of peace and order than 
three-quarters of a century of use. 

A huge oak in front of the 
house had had all its lower limbs 
lopped off ‘ — one of the sources 
of Lonny’s firewood. Mallory in* 
vestigated the three pick-up 
trucks. All were new. They were 
loaded with merchandise — a red 
plush divan, heaps of cheap new 
clothing, boxed shoes, kitchen ap- 
pliances., hand tools, television 
sets — Mallory counted three in 
one truck, four in another. Every- 
thing was rain-spotted and rust- 
stained. The thin veneer on the 
TV cabinets was peeling from 
weeks of exposure to the elements. 
The convertible’s interior, though 
obviously new, was musty and 
mouldy, soaked with rain, l^den 
leaves were packed in the front 
seat and over the fur coats and 
fishing rods and guns in the rear. 

“There were two other men 
here with Loimy and Mae when 
they first came,” Sally told Mal- 
lory. “They’d been looting all 
along the way here, loading up 
and then throwing things away to 
make room for more. They made 
trips every day for a week or so 
after they got here. The house is 
full of things. After a while they 
got tired of it.” 

“What happened to the other 
two men?” 

“There was a fight. Lonny beat 
them up. I haven’t seen them 
since.” 

“When did Jarvis arrive?” 

“About a month ago. Lonny 
almost shot him but he called out 
that he was a doctor. That 
saved him.”

IF 




“Why did you stay after they 
came?” 

“Where else was there to go?” 

“What about those towns where 
Lonny ^d his friends gathered 
in their prizes? Aren’t there any 
people there?” 

“No. I went into two towns 
while I was on my own — after 
I r^ away. I saw some dead 
bodies, not many. Everything was 
intact, just deserted.” 

Mallory turned as a door 
banged. Heavy footsteps clumped 
on the porch. Lonny stood there, 
rubbing his mouth with the back 
of his hand. He scratched his 
stomach, then slouched down the 
steps and toward Mallory and the 
girl. 

“I been thinking,” he said. 
“Get on out back the house and 
cut up that kindling.” 

“He’s not well enough, Lon- 
ny,” Sally said quickly. “Dr. Jar- 
vis said — ” 

“What do I care what that 
dried-up old man said? I told ye 
to git, dude — now git.” 

The big man started toward 
Mallory. 

“Lonny, stop.” Sally jumped in 
front of him. Lonny seized her as 
if to throw her down, then hesi- 
tated, obviously struck by a new 
thou^t. He pulled her close, his 
loose mouth searching for hers. 

There was a broken axe-handle 
lying near the trimmed twigs. 
Mallory caught it up, stepped up 
behind Lonny, raised the heavy 
billet and brought it down across 
the man’s head with a sound like 
a dropped pumpkin. Lonny totter- 
ed two steps, went to his knees. 

the seeds of GONYL 



Mallory walked around him, took 
careful aim and hit him again at 
the base of the neck. Lonny went 
down hard on his face. Mallory 
threw the club aside. 

“I’ve had all the Lonny I can 
take,” he said. 

S ALLY came to him, clung to 
him, her body trembling. 
Mallory held her, made sooth- 
ing sounds. 

“But what will happen when 
he comes to? Your arm — ” 

“I’m leaving,” he said. 

“Where will you go?” 

“I don’t know. Lincoln or 
Omaha. Somewhere there has to 
be some kind of organization, 
some troops holed up — some- 
thing.” 

“Jeff — are you sure about 
what happened back there in 
town?” 

“You believe Jarvis? You think 
I’m cra^?” 

“It isn’t a question of being 
crazy, Jeff. Just that under stress 
people sometimes see things that 
aren’t there. You know it can 
happen. It’s one of the mind’s 
defenses. It’s no disgrace — ” 
“When do I start believing? 
Now? Did I really give Lonny a 
concussion? Did Jarvis tell me 
the Russians have taken over the 
country? Are you real? Or am I 
imaeining this, too?” 

“I’m real, Jeff. Don’t ever 
doubt that.” 

He looked down into her face. 
She pressed against him, warm 
and ^ive. 

He let her go, stepped back. 
“My God, Sally, you’re my 

117 




daughter’s friend. I’m old enough 
to be — ” 

His voice trailed off, unequal 
to the cliche. 

“I’m nineteen, Jeff. I’m a wom- 
an. Certainly Lori’s my friend 
but that doesn’t — doesn’t — ” 

It was her turn to falter. 

“Sally, you’re a very lovely 
girl — woman, if you prefer. I’m 
twice your age. Don’t I find you 
desirable? Sure I do. That’s the 
the trouble.” 

“Things have changed, Jeff. 
Jeff. Three months ago you were 
just a nice middle-aged man, 
young-looking but surely worlds 
away from me. Now — it’s dif- 
ferent. Maybe it’s instinct. I don’t 
want one of those thin-legged 
mop-haired boys. I want a man. 
Someone who’U take care of me 
Someone like you.” 

“Sally, all this will end some 
day and everything will be back 
to normal — ” 

“Do you really believe that, 
Jeff?” 

“What would you have me do, 
Sally? Pretend it was all a dream 
and settle down here with Lonny 
and Mae and start enjoying a lot 
of leisure time?” 

“Jeff.” Sally took his hands. “If 
it’s the way you say it is — ^what 
can you do alone?” 

“I don’t know. I have to try.” 

Mallory looked at the pick-up 
trucks, walked over the the near- 
est, a pale blue Dodge. He cir- 
cled it, looking at the tires. Sally 
came up to him, took his arm. 

“I’m going with you,” she said. 

“Don’t be silly. You belong 
here.” 

118 



“With Lonny and Mae?” 

“Dr. Jarvis is here,” Mallory 
said. 

“We’d better dump this stuff 
out of the back,” Sally said and 
swung up on the side of the 
truck. 

Mallory hesitated for a mo. 
ment. Then he clambered up over 
the tailgate and awkwardly, one 
handedly, began tumbling tele- 
vision sets over the side. 

They left a half-hour later with 
the truck. Mae and Jarvis watch- 
ed from the porch as they drove 
away. Nobody waved. 

IV 

T hey drove until dark, cruis- 
ing at thirty miles an hour 
along empty roads. Three times 
they pass^ military Vehicles stall- 
ed in the road. Two were Rus- 
sian. One was American. There 
were no bodies around them. They 
passed through the town of Hick- 
man, desolate and deserted in the 
twilight. A few miles beyond, they 
pulled off the road into a stand 
of hickory trees. Sally helped Mal- 
lory inflate air mattresses, rig a 
tarpaulin over the truck. 

“It’s too bad we don’t have a 
double sleeping bag,” Sally said. 
“I want to sleep close to you. I 
want to know you’re here.” 

“I’U be here, Sally,” MaUory 
said. 

“Jeff, tell me about yourself. I 
want to know all about you.” 
“Where should I begin? With 
my exciting childhood in the or- 
phanage?” 

“Oh, Jeff, were you really — ” 

IF 




“It wasn’t exactly an orphan- 
age. More of a paying home for 
some lucky lads who didn’t hap- 
to have families. It wasn’t bad. 
We were well fed and clothed and 
the school was good. But it was 
all a bit impersonal.” 

“Don’t you have any family at 
all?” 

Mallory laughed briefly. 

“No. Not unless you want to 
count Uncle Al.” 

“Tell mo about him.” 

“He used to come to see me. 
He was a big man with a big 
mustache and strange, colorful 
clothes. He smoked cigars with 
a wonderful smell. He’d tell me 
stories — all about a marvelous 
Old House that he was going to 
some lucky lads who didn’t hap- 
excited about it. And then I’d 
wake up.” 

“Oh? You mean — ” 

“Uncle Al was just a dream.” 
“Jeff — ” She clung tightly to 
him. “I’m no dream. I’m real — 
and I’m here.” 

“Yes,” Mallory said. “And I’m 
glad you are, Sally. Very glad — ” 

T he next day they pushed 
north through Johnson 
and Otoe Counties, passing desert- 
ed farms, deserted towns. South 
of Lincoln they found the road 
blocked by a jumble of wrecked 
vehicles — a pile-up in the dark, 
Mallory guess^. He saw some 
dirt mounds in the field beside 
the road — graves, hastily dug 
and untended. 

They back-tracked, detoured 
east. Just before noon, under a 
wet, gray sky, they came to the 

THE SEEDS OF GONYL 



outskirts of the village of Alvo, 
drove along the potholed main 
street, pulled into a formerly pros- 
perous Shell station, now over- 
grown with weeds springing up 
through cracks in the pavement. 
Cars were still parked on the 
cracked apron. Mallory cut a six- 
foot length from a plastic hose to 
siphon fuel from the tank of a 
heavy, dusty Cadillac, took a can 
of oil from a stack by the pumps. 
He wiped the truck’s windshield, 
examined the tires, then broke 
open the door to the women’s 
toilet for Sally. 

He saw a display of firearms 
in a sporting gocxls store across 
the street. The door was locked 
but Mallory broke it open with 
a kick. He helped himself to a 
.32 caliber Browning automatic 
pistol in a black leather shoulder 
holster. He buckled an ammu- 
nition belt around his waist, open- 
ed a box of fat brass cartridges 
and filled the loops, dumped the 
rest of the box into his pocket. 
As an afterthought he picked up 
a Mauser .25, filled the magazine 
and a spare, slipped it into his 
watch pocket. He exchanged his 
soiled coat for a lightweight, 
fleece^lined, genuine leather wind- 
breaker, took a pair of pigskin 
driving gloves, added a sheath 
knife and a small flashlight. A 
display of shoes caught his eye. 
He spent another five minutes se- 
lecting a pair of tough Cordovan 
climbing boots and heavy wool 
socks. 

“You look ready for anything 
now,” Sally said admiringly. 

“And we’ll probably meet it” 

119 




They drove through the town, 
'^e roar of the engine shattered 
litter stillness. They passed the 
last scattering of hamburger joints 
and cut-rate service stations, slow- 
ed for a railroad underpass fol- 
lowed by a sharp turn. As Mal- 
lory swung the comer, a man 
stepped into the road fifty yards 
ahead. He wore a baggy gray 
tunic and khaki pants, a flat cap 
with red band. The submachine 
gun in his hands was aimed 
squarely at the windshield of the 
tmck. Mallory braked to a stop 
twenty feet from the man. More 
soldiers emerged from conceal- 
m^t in the brown growth of 
weed. 

“Russians,” Sally whispered. 

O NE of the soldiers, an offi- 
cer to judge from the shoul- 
der boards and the bolstered auto- 
matic, sauntered forward, a cig- 
arette between his lips. He had 
a wide mouth, eyes that were nar- 
rowed to slits, sandy hair that 
needed cutting. A couple of med- 
als were pinned to his stained 
tunic. He stood by the truck, 
looking it Over, looking Mallory 
over, peering expressionle^ly at 
Sally. 

“Get out, please,” he said in a 
conversational tone and stepped 
back a pace. “Put both hands 
over your heads.” 

Mallory and the girl climbed 
down. They stood in the road, 
waiting. The men came, glanced 
at them, checked the back of 
the tmck. At a nod from the offi- 
cer, one of the men searched 
them, took Mallory’s .32. 

120 



“I am Lieutenant Brozhny,” 
the officer said. “Who are you? 
Where do you come from?” 

He had only a faint Slavonic 
accent. 

“I’m a civilian. Mallory is the 
name. This is Miss Hodges. We 
came from near Beatrice.” 

“How near?” 

“Twelve miles.” 

“Why did you leave? The sick- 
ness?” 

“There isn’t any sickness.” 
“You are aware this area has 
been designated off limits?” 

“I could see it was deserted.” 
“You do not believe in follow- 
ing orders issued by competent 
authority?” 

“I never heard of the orders.” 
“The woman is your wife? 
Mistress?” 

“Mistress,” Sally said prompt- 
ly, taking Mallory’s arm. 

The officer pur^ his lips. 
“What did you observe in the 
vicinity of Beatrice?” He shifted 
his gaze from Mallory to Sally, 
back again, watching their expres- 
sions. Sally pressed Mallory’s arm 
wamingly. 

“Nothing,” he said. 

The officer nodded as if this 
were the answer he had expected 
“I must ask you to accompa^ 
me to my headquarters,” he said 
“This is a matter for the colonel 
to deal with.” 

“You don’t have to arrest us. 
I told you were were nonconi' 
batants — ” ^ 

“There are no noncombatants^” 
the lieutenant said. “Please gpl 
into your vehicle. One of my mefl 
will drive.”

Mallory and Sally climbed into 
the cab. A gr inni ng, thick-fea- 
tured youth with a goaty odor 
pushed in under the wheel, start- 
ed up with a grinding of the 
starter gears. Fifty feet along the 
road a six-by-six Studebaker truck 
rolled out from the shelter of a 
tattered and sagging billboard. 
The other men swarmed aboard 
it. 

The pick-up did a U-tum and 
followed the bigger truck back 
toward the town limits of Crete. 
They drove through the three- 
block business district, past anoth- 
er block of houses of diminishing 
grandeur, turned left into a farm 
road. It led for a mile across flat 
prairie. As it topped a rise Mal- 
lory saw a vast encampment 
spread across the fields below. 
There were acres of tents, miles 
of muddy catwalks, a score of 
jeeps, trucks, command cars, 
bearing the white star of the U.S. 
Army, some the red Soviet star. 
Men by the hundreds gazed out 
through the barbed-wire that en- 
circled the bivouac. 

The pick-up braked beside a 
large farm house near the center 
of the camp, under a stand of 
sycamores. 

Sally held Mallory’s hand as 
they climbed down to follow the 
Russian officer toward the house. 
The men standing by stared at 
the girl as they passed. The lieu- 
tenant conducted them through a 
former living room from which all 
the furniture had been removed, 
with the exception of some 
straight chairs and a library table. 
A uniformed girl sat at the table.

typing. A large map of the state 
and the adjoining area was taped 
to the wail. Colored pins were 
stuck on the map in no discern- 
ible pattern. 

“Wait here,” Brozhny said. 

He went through a door and 
closed it behind him. 

Through the curtainless win- 
dows men could be seen wander- 
ing across the yard. 

“They don’t seem to be wor- 
ried about the American prisoners 
causing any trouble,” Sily said. 
“They let them wander around 
loose — not even guarded.” 

The door opened. The lieuten- 
ant beckoned. Mallory and S^ly 
entered the adjoining room. It was 
a former parlor. A man lounged 
in a swivel chair behind a large 
desk. He played with a pencil 
held in blunt fingers. He was big, 
with a tough, square face short 
reddish hair. He wore a green uni- 
form with three rows of ribbons 
and the silver eagles of a U.S. 
colonel. 

H e looked at Mallory and 
the girl. 

“I’m Colonel Strang,” he said. 
“Brozhny tells you claim to have 
come from near Beatrice. That 
right?” 

Mallory nodded. “Clear up one 
point for me, will you, Colonel? 
Who’s in charge? You or the Rus- 
sians?” 

Strang stared at him. Brozhny 
laughed. 

“You thought the dreaded 
Reds had invaded Nebraska?” the 
lieutenant inquired in an amused 
tone. 



“Invaded, hell” Strang said and 
laughed without humor. “We in- 
vit^ them in. They’re our allies. 
We’ve been invaded, all right — 
but not by Russia.” 

“I’m ^ad you realize that,” 
MaQory said. “Nobody believ^ 
my description. I was about to 
to be convinced I was seeing 
things.” 

“What are you talking about, 
man?” Strang frowned up at Mal- 
lory. 

“I’m talking about the crea- 
tures that have taken over Bea- 
trice.” 

“Creatures?” 

“You said you knew we’d been 
invaded.” 

“And so we have,” Strang said 
grimly. “By the Chinese Com- 
munists.” 



4 4/T\hey hit us on the morning 
X of the twenty-third of No- 
vember,” Strang said. “A day that 
will live in iiifamy beside Pearl 
Harbor and the sinking of the 
Maine, We underestimated the 
Chinese — underestimated them 
badly. They had stuff we’d never 
dreamed of. They came dropping 
straight in from extreme altitude 
at velocities our radar people 
couldn’t believe. We launched 
everything we had — and they 
picked it out of the air. The Air 
Force scrambled — but there was 
nothing for the fighters to fight. 
The bombers were called back 
when word came down on the hot- 
line that the enemy wasn’t the 
Russians. Then our radar went 
out. All of it, all at once. But

wc knew where they were 
Rouped. We poured in the 
firepower, low-level bombers, 
strafers, armor. None of it got 
anywhere. Aircraft went out of 
control and crashed. Vehicles 
stopped dead. Guns wouldn’t fire. 
That was when we called in the 
Red Army. And then, of course, 
the Sickness hit us. We had to pull 
back and regroup.” 

“Is the fighting still going on?” 
Strang frown^. “There hasn’t 
actually been any fighting as such. 
The Chinks are an elusive enemy. 
We can’t even make contact, 
danm it.” The Colonel’s fist hit 
the desk. “But we’ve got ’em 
stalled, bogged down. They bit off 
too much. They can’t chew it.” 
“That was diree months ago,” 
Mallory said. “What’s happened 
since?” 

“We’ve taken advantage of the 
lull to consolidate our positions, 
prepare our counterattack.” 

“If you haven’t made contact 
— how do you know it’s the Chi- 
nese?” 

“Who else would it be?” Strang 
came back. “And how is it you 
know nothing of all this?” 

“He’s been sick,” Sally spoke 
up quickly. “He’s had amnesia.” 
Strang grunted. “You claim you 
were near Beatrice. You saw 
nothing?” 

“I haven’t seen any signs of the 
Chinese,” Mallory said carefully. 

Strang nodded. “What did you 
do in civilian life, Mr. Mallory?” 
“I’m an engineer.” 

“Good,” Strang nodded. “I need 
engineers. I need everything I can 
get but qualified men most of

all. Mallory, I’m prepared to offer 
you a commission in my army.” 

“.Your army?” 

Strang gave him a hard stare. 

“That’s what I said. I raised it, 
I provision it, I give the orders. 
My army.” 

“What does Washington say to 
all this?” 

“Not a damned thing.” Strang 
said softly. “Or Moscow either. 
Better readjust your thinking, Mr. 
Mallory. The old organization is 
gone. Communications are gone 
and with them the old govern- 
ment, the old economy. The soon- 
er you realize that, the better 
chance you’ll have of surviving 
under the new conditions.” 

“What’s happened to all the 
people?” 

“I took the able-bodied ones, 
of course. The rest have been 
evacuated outside my perimeter. 
Why?” 

“I just wondered how they fit 
into the new order.” 

“Forget them, Mallory: There 
are matters of naore immediate 
concern. As an officer, you’ll have 
the best, of course. I’ve scoured 
the countryside, stockpiling sup- 
plies. You’ll find we live pretty 
well here. Not that we’re settling 
into complacency. Let the enemy 
get the impression that we are. 
All the better when I’m ready to 
make my move. They’ve put their 
necks into a noose, concentrating 
as they have. Panicked, no doubt, 
after their first unexpected suc- 
cesses. Like the Japs after' Pearl 
Harbor, they’d wiped out the U.S. 
Navy and didn’t Imow what to do 
next.” Strang rose, paced across 

124 



the room and turned. “Damned 
shame you saw nothing in the 
Beatrice area. I need Intelligence, 
Mallory — need it badly. I’d give 
my left arm to know what the 
yellow bastards are up to.” He 
smacked his fist into his palm. 
“But with it or without it, I in- 
tend to hit them with everything 
I’ve got — and wipe the city of 
Beatrice off the map.” 

“Colonel -r- there are no Chi- 
nese in Beatrice,” Mallory said. 
“And how would you know?” 
“I was there — two days ago.” 
Strang walked around behind 
his desk and seated himself. He 
opened a drawer and took out an 
automatic pistol, laid it on the 
desk before him. 

“Tell it from the beginning, 
Mallory. This time tell it 

Mallory gave a terse account of 
everything that had happened 
from the moment of his awaken- 
ing until his departure from the 
city. Strang eyed him disgustedly 
when he finished. 

“Your brains are scrambled,” 
he said flatly. 

“Colonel, try to keep an open 
mind. Consider what I’m telling 
you. Everything you’ve said fits 
in with what I’ve told you — ” 
“Poppycock.” 

“Have you seen a Chinese 
soldier? Even a corpse?” Mallory 
demanded. 

“I’ve explained to you — ” 
“You’re wrong! There are thou- 
sands of people trapped in Bea- 
trice. You can’t bomb the city. 
Colonel. It would be mass mur- 
der!”

IF 








All brain fronn 
birth, he had to 
learn about heart! 

O NE-GIRK-TWO sadly shivered 
against the cold of this 
strange, possibly hostile, alien 
world. Fingers of light probed be^ 
tween the mountain depressions 
ahead, signifying that morning had 
come and that the time had ar- 
rived to awaken his whole body, 
in this, his life’s greatest trial. 



125 



The swirled yellow-in-blue 
snappers around his boulder had 
finally quieted, some of the 
wounded dying while the more 
aggressive ones had scuttled away 
search of other prey. One-Girk- 
Two stared at the remining horde 
below, shivering with the thought 
of how close those razor-sharp 
claws had come to his soft, or- 
ganic form. How fortunate he had 
been to respond in terror to their 
noisy click-clack during the dark 
of the night and to have scrambled 
to his present safe perch. From 
the number of injuries and deaths 
below, they must have slashed one 
another in wild displays of temper 
and frustration during the night. 

Was patience a necessary solu- 
tion against the dangerous ele- 
ments of this planet? Was it a 
necessary characteristic which he 
must possess to advance from a 
Two to a One? 

He did not know. 

Whatever the case, he was 
thrilled by the opportunity to 
strive for the mighty advance- 
ment of himself from a Two to 
a One. The fact that all of his 
kind had similar chances — or 
perished — made no difference to 
him. Instinctively and conscious- 
ly his tiny body cried for the 
right and rejoiced at the situation’s 
potential. 

Every One-Girk longed to be 
a One-Girk-One for that was the 
nature of his genetic heritage as 
well as his purpose for being. 



Actually the symbols One, Girk 
and Two were quite literal tran- 
scriptions of an otherwise alien 
viewpoint most difficult for hu- 
man understanding. Though nec- 
essarily such symbols are vague 
approximations of their true 
meaning, human analogues exist 
which correspond and are useful. 
The first One stood for the fact 
that One-Girk-Two was composed 
primarily of neural tissue whose 
ultimate function might be that of 
providing the drive and decision- 
making function of the Unit — 
a composite of many Girks, each 
of different but coordinated func- 
tion. 

The Two stood for the fact 
that this particular One-Girk had 
achieved success in passing every 
civilized test for his species — 
fourteen in total number — except 
the last’ Should he pass this last 
test, consisting partially of his 
ability to survive in a strange and 
hostile environment and partially 
upon an as yet unknown set of 
criteria, he would automatically 
raise himself to the rank of a 
One-Girk-One, with all of its 
rights and privileges assigned. 

Which simply meant that this 
particular Girk organism had been 
approved by the standards of his 
society and that he was fit to 
coordinate the activities of the 
complete, composite organism 
which made up the Girk Unit. 

Though his tiny eyebuds still 
roved over the tom and slain 



126 




snappers, One-Girk-Two’s busy 
thoughts actually reflected the les- 
sons he had learned during his 
early period of trail successes. 
Being a Unit was the highest 
ideal. Noting and understanding 
relationships is a great achieve- 
ment. To appreciate interrelation- 
ships fully, however, one must be 
a Unit. The fragments of instinct- 
ive concepts within the range of 
One-Girk-Two were awesome and 
overshadowed all feelings of fear 
during his present hideous test. 

H e glanced toward the 
horizon noting the fhin, dull 
streak of light reflected through 
the morning clouds. Dew had just 
fallen, leaving glistening spheres 
everywhere. One - Girk - Two 
stretched his surface membranes, 
the better to absorb the moisture. 

Turning back to the snappers 
below, he considered their rela- 
tionship to the flora and fauna 
around. Without predators of 
some kind the fertile grasses and 
forests would soon be overgrazed 
and overburdened with herbivor- 
ous life forms. Then, life’s balance 
destroyed, all would wither and 
die until a new balance came into 
being. 

He recognized the last thought 
as fragmentary, far below the Unit 
knowledge level of interrelation- 
ships. With the snappers, proper 
toll was taken of the herbivorous 
life forms, food of another kind 
was returned to the grasses below 

TO THE LAST RITE! 



— and this was as far as his pres- 
ent knowledge reached. Every 
cycle had other cycles interlaced 
— the rain, the grass, the 
minerals, the animals — perhaps, 
even as a lowly One-Girk-Two, if 
he were to concentrate sufficiently 
long and hard he would be able to 
see how the very planet’s motion 
cycled and interlaced with the ul- 
timate purpose of the snappers. 

The thought was one to muse 
on. But now the light had be- 
come stronger and he knew that 
the day would bring a new set 
of trials, a new set of tests — 
perhaps even his death. It was 
nevertheless a joyfully encounter- 
ed time — for it could bring him 
closer to Unit status. 

His appendages were weak, de- 
veloped primarily for locking into 
Unit position for life. His tools 
were primitive — a heat gun, a 
food converter, a signal generator. 
Somewhere during the night a 
change in attitude had taken 
place in his makeup. Unable at 
first to use the heat gun against 
life forms even in self-defense, 
One-Girk-Two had scrabbled 
away from the snappers and found 
safety above their clacking claws. 
He had rationalized the action to 
himself as unwillingness to use up 
the charge. 

But the night’s changes in his 
attitude now caused him to un- 
limber the heat beam, take aim 
at the still living, dangerous snap- 
pers and press the button. Steam 



127 




sizzled upward from the rocks be- 
low until they were covered with 
charred and smelly snappers no 
longer capable of action against 
him. He was truly relieved — 
their sharply lined mouths and 
their clutching, curling foot pods, 
too, were gone. 

Another attitude had changed. 
Patience is good. Death, too, may 
serve a purpose — that another 
might live. 

Would this thought endure for 
him to bring back? He did not 
surface? He did not know. 

His immediate danger over, 
he still held back to think through 
his next move. The light would 
soon be stronger. The ship, which 
was most certainly monitoring his 
every movement, would probably 
expect him to move soon. Would 
his test be valid without his mov- 
ing constantly over the planet’s 
surface? He did not know. 

Probably Inaction would mean 
automatic failure. And, having 
failed the test, this particular One- 
Girk-Two would be eliminated 

— killed as useless, of no purpose 
in the cycle of things in his pres- 
ent form. He would be destroyed 

— returned to ashes of ordinary 
chemical compounds to be spread 
over the single broad sea of the 
home planet. 

How civilized the test was! 
Tens of thousands of years ago 
the Two - Girk - Ones (bodies). 
Three - Girk - Ones (mobiles), 
along with the One - Girk - Ones 



(brains), were assembled into 
Units by trial and error caused 
by the play of wind and wave. 
How long it must have taken be- 
fore civilization created a sensible 
set of rules for the making of Unit 
selections. 

The value of each assembled 
Unit was a matter of the selection 
process, too. He knew that should 
he survive the current tests he 
would become a part of a very 
important Unit indeed. Great in- 
ward pleasure swept through One- 
Girk-Two as he contemplated the 
future. 

The sun’s rays probed his soft 
flesh. He pushed out his almost 
atrophied, fine - line appen- 
dages and used them to move 
himself from the rock. Gravity 
was stronger here by an eighth 
than on his home world. Simple 
movement was slow and time- 
consuming. He woke his body and 
put every cell to the effort of 
traversing the long, grassy valley. 
His senses were alerted for the 
tiniest sound which might indicate 
movement of snappers. His eyes 
and tympanic membranes were 
especially alerted for dangers 
of unknown size and type. 

Ahead he could see waving 
strands of. blue-green grass. To 
his right were low-lying hills, 
browned and dusty in the morning 
sun. Oh his left was a creek bed 
and beyond the creek bed he could 
see a thick forest of dark blue- 
green. 



128 



IF 




Immediately ahead he could 
spot the double humps of nesting 
insects he had found numerous 
and painful. On the day ot his 
aniv^ he had walked unknowing- 
ly into similar humps to be stung 
again and again. He gave these 
two wide berth. 

He arrived at the dry creek bed. 
He was careful not to dislodge 
gravel or rattle the dry, noisy 
brush as he slipped down to the 
bottom. 

The creek bed followed the 
edge of the forest and One-Girk- 
Two noted that a cleared space 
on either side of the bed gave 
him easy view of possible dangers. 
His only problems were the 
sharp-edged stones and pointed 
sticks that every now and then 
gouged into his tender flesh. 
Travel was not too hard, however. 

T he sudden sounds of scram- 
bling rocks and the sliding of 
many feet slowed, then stopped 
him. He edged his slight tKxiy 
under the roots of a tree at the 
edge of the creek almost without 
thinking. The thundering noise 
rapidly turned to billows of dust 
and the outlines of gigantic ani- 
mals. One-Girk-Two raised his 
heat beam to face the great bulks 
in the event the beasts chose him 
for their target. He did not think 
the beam would have much effect 
on their thick hides, however. He 
hid quietly. 

The herd thundered past with- 
TO THE LAST RITE! 



out noting the little intruder. One- 
Girk-Two eased out to the middle 
of the bed again. He looked down- 
ward to find his signal generator 
gone. Without the ability to sig- 
nal his position he would never 
be pick^ up by the ship. That 
was the same as failing the test! 

He backtracked anxiously, 
heaved a mental sigh when he 
found the equipment hanging to 
a root in his earlier hiding place. 
He carefully placed it back on his 
body by means of its loose strap, 
checked his food converter and 
retraced his path. 

The creek bed finally turned 
away from the forest. One-Girk- 
Two painfully pulled himself over 
the steep bank on the forest side. 
He did not want to go among 
the trees. Many unknowns could 
hide there. Still, the sun beat hot 
and heavy against his thin skin 
and the heat plus lack of moisture 
were major determinants in his 
next decision. He eased himself 
into the shadows of the vegeta- 
tion, laboriously pulling himself 
along by means of brush and 
clumps of tough grass. 

Presently he stood before a 
giant black-boled tree fringed with 
delicate blue-green, lacy stringers. 
He looked up and saw thick 
branches and gnarled limbs linked 
with gossamer webbing. Birds? In- 
sects? Plants? He did not know. 

He stepped gingerly for- 
ward, took another step, then sud- 
denly felt himself caught and spun 

129 




up and forward. His tiny appen- 
dages were held tightly. He could 
not reach for his heat beam; his 
body was held almost equally 
tight. 

He could not budge. 

II 

S trands of sticky fibers 
closed in on One - Girk- 
Two, wrapping him in a nest of 
crisscross lines. He reflected on 
his position, noting other bundles 
like himself hanging from other 
tree branches. 

One bundle jerked and bobbed, 
swinging. The creature in it must 
have been stubborn — its motion 
never stopped nor decreased in 
intensity. T^e bundle jerked and 
swung for what seemed like hours. 
Suddenly upon it loomed a huge 
amorphous organism of generally 
spherical shape. And One-Giric 
Two could see that the new being 
had no observable appendages but 
somehow was able to cling to the 
jerking bundle. 

A told extruded from the crea- 
ture and. stretched over the jerk- 
ing bundle, wrapped around it. 
Soon the jerking decreased in in- 
tensity. 

One - Girk - Two sensed the 
odds were heavily against his sur- 
vival. A deep depression struck 
him. Then, as swift as thought, 
his spirits soared as his imagery 
focused on his potential for reach- 
ing Unit status. 

130 



He acted swiftly, massing all of 
his neural tissue together, linking 
each cell to the others and pushing 
his thoughts inward toward a cen- 
tral, hard core of being that de- 
manded, over the random pulses 
of each tissue layer, attention to 
the central problem of escape. 

His associations flowed in a dis- 
ciplined manner, searching and 
discarding possible solutions to 
his present plight. Finally the most 
probable line of approach ap- 
peared and was seized upon by 
more and more clusters of his 

neuronic boundaries. His 

massive intellect tested the thought, 
explored bypaths and finally 
resolved to try the idea. 

One - Giric - Two refocused 
part of his tissues on the animal 
ahead, primarily to keep up his 
guard. Then, with other parts of 
his body, he began the simple 
process of secreting liquids 
through his external membrane. 
The weak, watery acid was rapid- 
ly absorbed by the vegetable-like 
fibers holding him and capillary 
action moved the fluid evenly 
throughout the network. The wetn 
bing sagged, broke open. A nearly 
dehydrated One - Girk - Two fell 
clumsily to the ground. 

He knew a swift surge of pride 
and happiness, not at the thought 
of his own cleverness but at the 
thought that he was still eligible 
as a Unit component. 

Turning his attention back to 
the surrounding jungle, he care- 

IF 




fully bypassed the webbing struc- 
tures, slowly making his way 
once more through the tangled 
jungle. 

His external membrane slowly 
absorbed moisture from the rising 
humidity beneath the thick 
foliage, restoring his body fluids. 
Hunger came. But a mere mo- 
ment’s effort was needed to drop 
organic materials through his food 
converter and change them to a 
thin paste his body could ingest. 

He rested on the trunk of a 
fallen tree before moving on. 

P ART of One - Girk - Two’s 
conscious thought dwelt on 
the environment around him, 
comparing and classifying sensa- 
tions and shapes into safe, 
possibly safe, possibly dangerous 
and dangerous categories. The 
vine now ahead of him, for ex- 
ample, appeared as safe a s 
thousands of others he had seen. 

Another part of this thought 
process, like some small, irritating 
insect, considered the principles or 
philosophies he was expected to 
formulate and present during the 
final testing. So far he had 
changed his pattern of behavior 
by killing other life forms. It fol- 
lowed that his attitude and orien- 
tation toward himself and the uni- 
verse were also changed. Was the 
change in the proper direction? 
He did not know. 

Certainly the development of 
utilizing his whole mass of neural 

TO THE LAST RITE! 



tissue when confronted with an 
otherwise unsolvable problem was 
in the right direction. Everything 
he instinctively knew about his 
hoped-for and ultimate goal spoke 
of even higher, almost godlike, 
powers of concentration that 
would be his as a Unit. 

The vine ahead of him waved 
but so did all the other vines, 
hanging nearby. The wind reached 
the vegetation through a cone in 
the jungle roof. One-Girk-Two 
passed under the dangling plant 
when, without any warning at all, 
it twisted and curled itself around 
him. 

One - Girk - Two contracted 
his body and slipped out of the 
coils. Unfortunately his heat beam 
was jerked from its carrying strap 
and crushed. 

Shock struck One - Girk - Two 
at his loss. Could he survive this 
hostile environment without the 
heat weapon? 

He did not know. 

B y the time One-Girk-Two 
had pushed his way up the 
steep ridge beyond the first sec- 
tion of jungle, daylight was no 
more than a faint, gray line 
stretched along the horizon. He 
figured that the last of it would 
be gone in moments. 

His passage had been slow and 
difficult. Deep shadows smoothed 
the ground around him while be- 
neath him he could still feel the 
occasional pain from loose rocks 



131 




and dead branches which often 
masked treacherous holes and low 
places. 

Twice he fell into such holes, 
making no outcry. Each time he 
carefully appraised his position, 
then pulled himself out in the 
most logical and expeditious man- 
ner. The unfamiliar gravity was 
beginning to take its toll, too. His 
body seemed to sag and his ap- 
pendages, never very strong, were 
slower and slower to respond to 
his mental demands. With each 
step he became more aware of a 
weakness in his plans. How could 
he have decided simply to move 
on and on across this planet with 
no purpose to his direction? Per- 
haps he should have waited first 
to develop his philosophies. 

Whatever the case, his present 
need was to rest the night on the 
ridge overlooking the thick forest 
below. There he would at least, 
be safe from snappers. What else 
might lie in wait for him was un- 
known and unknowable — hence, 
must be risked. 

He reached the end of the nar- 
row, tablelike plateau along which 
he had traveled. Light was grow- 
ing steadily weaker. In a very 
short while he would be on top 
of the ridge and would command 
his body to rest while part of 
him kept watch. 

A dry stick crackled and One- 
Girk-Two again plunged suddenly 
downward. This time his fall was 
more severe due to a longer dis- 



tance. His body flattened outward, 
forming a thin membrane stretch- 
ing precariously over rough, sharp 
rocks. More slowly than other 
times he pulled himself together 
and heightened his other senses. 

He could hear a low, muted 
air-sound at the end of his cav- 
emlike trap. Assuming the sound 
to be the breathing of some kind 
of unknown, burrowing animal, he 
concentrated his senses on the 
walls surrounding him. 

The hole through which he had 
fallen had straight walls from top 
to bottom, showing no projections 
whatsoever. He had landed on 
tumbled rocks and organic debris, 
most of which had probably been 
sucked through the same hole that 
had caught him. But even in the 
dying light One - Girk - Two 
could see a tunnel lined with jag- 
ged rocks, probably created by an- 
cient earth processes of long ago. 
The breathing came from some- 
where in the darker portion of the 
tunnel. 

One - Girk - Two pulled 
himself into a corner of the pit 
and waited, every sense alert. The 
breathing seemed to rise and fall 
in decibels, depending upon how 
close he pinpointed its source. To 
test his conjecture he pushed his 
body toward the noise. The 
breathing quickened, grew louder. 

One - Girk Two permitted his 
tissue to rest while part of his 
thoughts dwelt on the breathing 
phenomenon. The animal might 



132 



IF 




or might not be dangerous. It 
pould also be more frightened of 
him than he of it. In either case, 
his tissues needed rest and, until 
some light found its way into this 
new prison, his best judgment 
was that he should now rest. 

Morning arrived. Slim streaks 
of light found their way into his 
hole. The animal in the tunnel 
proved considerably smaller than 
One - Girk - Two. Dark fur cov- 
ered its whole body. Its peering 
eyes were sunk beneath folds of 
fur, showing large black centers 
for the collection of the dim light. 

He could make out small forms 
under the animal’s body and real- 
ized that these were young and 
that the fur-covered parent prob- 
ably would never leave until he 
did. He congratulated himself for 
having chosen to wait during the 
night before — even harmless ani- 
mals will attack when their young 
appear to be threatened. 

One-Girk-Two surmised that 
the tunnel was the animal’s nor- 
mal entranceway to the cavern. He 
decided to bypass the nest in any 
effort to make his way to the 
outside world. 

He grasped a rocky shard, 
held it between himself and the 
frightened animal as he moved 
toward and alongside the nest, 
beast bared its rows of teeth, re- 
positioning itself always to face 
the intruder. 

One - Girk - Two sidled past, 
pressing toward the opening. 

TO THE LAST RITE! 



He let himself down into a nar- 
row gash, shallow and barely wide 
enough to accomodate his bulk, 
yet a lucky opening, maybe, to 
the outside world. He worked his 
way down slowly, finding descent 
surprisingly easy — until his good 
fortune ended. 

Above his head was a crevice 
too high to climb. Through it 
came a spear of light illuminating 
a steep opening at his lower 
appendages. He could not leap 
across the gap. 

H e puzzled over the impasse 
for a moment, then put all 
of his mind to work on the prob- 
lem as he had learned to do when 
caught by the tree-webbing. Time 
stretched out for him while con- 
nections and cross-connections 
were forged. Every possible solu- 
tion to his difficulty presented it- 
self and was discarded for one 
reason or another — including 
the retracting of steps to secure 
bridge-building materials from the 
burrowing animal’s nest. 

The only solution was no solu- 
tion at all — rather, it was a gam- 
ble. He must attempt the jump. 
His brain estimated that his death 
was probable, regardless of which 
alternative he took. It told him 
that the probability of his suc- 
cessfully jumping the crevice was 
small — as little as, perhaps, 
0.00001. Yet to do nothing was 
also certain death, for it meant 
failure. 



133 




He glanced down again, noting 
the sharp projections of rocks 
along the sides of the crevice. He 
could not see the bottom. He did 
hear a light sibilance — a breath 
of air or maybe an echo of run- 
ning water. Perhaps his brain had 
estimated a choice based upon 
subliminal impressions — perhaps 
there was water below. 

He set himself for the jump. 
He gathered together his various 
appendages and pushed them all 
in the same direction against the 
floor, arching clumsily over the 
center of the crevice. 

He did not make it. He fell 
swiftly. 

Ill 

T he fall was long. One- 
Girk-Two believed that his 
body could not repair itself after a 
fall of such a distance. The noise 
of coursing water became plain, 
however, and just after drifting 
into deep despair, he found 
himself plunging deeply into a 
cold, swift stream. His body 
pushed through the water and 
pressed itself lightly against the 
stream bed before the effects of 
the fall stopped. 

Naturally buoyant, his body 
rose to the surface of the stream 
where, bobbing around and up 
and down like a piece of tree 
bark, he rode the stream’s swift, 
dark flight. 

One - Girk - Two adjusted his 

134 



metabolism to both the dark and 
the cold. He realized that his food 
converter was gone. He reached 
into the surrounding water in 
search of it but to no avail. 

The stream’s pounding through 
rocks and narrow cre^ces was 
now audible. One - Girk - Two 
was heavily battered at every turn. 
The stream arched outward in a 
long, sweeping waterfall which he 
rode down, plunging once again 
to the bottom. 

The tunnel walls widened and 
his ride became more even and 
slow. 

Light showed at the end of the 
tunnel. Like a leisurely and plea- 
sure-seeking vacationer One - 
Girk-Two finally floated out of 
the tunnel’s mouth and into sun- 
light. 

He was too exhausted to strug- 
gle from the river to the bank. 
He rested most of his .body but 
let his remaining neural tissue 
dwell on whatever random stimuli 
came to it. Inevitably his thoughts 
raced back to the beginning of his 
present plight and the conflicting 
emotions he felt over it. 

He was still alive, hence cer- 
tainly still eligible for One-Girk- 
One status. Were his signal gen- 
erator to be activated now, sig- 
naling the end of this portion of 
the final test, he would still be 
lacking those essential principles 
required for the true Unit status. 
What could they be? He did 
not know. 



IF 




Cover was scant along the 
stream’s banks. There was only a 
litter of rocks that had — in storm- 
ridden times past — ^scoured muddy 
grooves down the mountainside 
^nd had come to rest along the 
foot of its scrubby, thinly grown 
foothills. 

Such plant life as existed had 
managed to sprout and to main- 
tain itself on barren ground in 
the heat-blasted summers and ex- 
tremely bitter winters. Scorching 
heat, even now, caused visible 
steam to rise from the river’s 
surface. 

One - Girk - Two had passed 
through a steep mountain range 
which divided this land into two 
climate zones. He almost wished 
for a return to the more com- 
fortable but probably more dan- 
gerous jungle zone. Only his signal 
generator remained. Food there 
would be plentiful for him to 
absorb through his membrane. 
Here, without his food converter 
and heat-beam, his nourishment 
would probably have to come 
from raw blood of small animals. 
He shivered at the uncivilized 
thought. 

By now the sun had reached its 
highest point. One - Girk - Two, 
using only a portion of his tis- 
sues, ma.de the decision to stay in 
the water. It had slowed to a 
sluggish, muddy river. 

He let his body rest, closing 
down even more of his conscious 
processes until only slight atten- 

TO THE LAST RITE! 



tion was placed on the surround-; 
ing environment. The river swept 
slowly around snaky bends, mov- 
ing him as much as five miles in 
curvilinear distance for every mile 
of linear. 

Trees, tall and stately, began to 
appear along the banks of the 
river. The sun passed its zenith 
ai\d crept downward and the trees 
cast longer shadows. Another 
turn in the river and a net fell 
over One - Girk - Two, entangling 
him and stimulating his tissue to 
full wakefulness. 

P RIMITIVE animals in hollowed- 
out.logs, had surrounded his 
floating form and thrown a net 
over him while he had rested. 
They appeared to be bipedal with 
two arms, two eyes, two ears and 
coverings of purple, silky, hair- 
like growth. Their mouths were 
rounded and, as they made what 
seemed to be talking noises to 
one another, he could see vicious- 
looking, needle-sharp teeth. 

One jabbed at him with a wide 
stick probably used to propel a 
log through the water. One-Girk- 
Two let his membrane stretch to 
absorb the blow. 

His appendages were busy be- 
low the waterline, testing and 
searching every strand in the net 
for some access route or weak 
link. He found none. 

The net was drawn together 
more tightly and, without further 
blows from the floating animals. 



135 




he was hauled into one of their 
hollowed logs. Here their inspec- 
tion became more detailed and 
more painful to One - Girk - Two. 
Two of the animals, using sharp- 
ened sticks, prodded and poked 
him in every possible spot. 

Again and again he adjusted 
his membrane to absorb the 
blows but even his remarkable 
stretching capacity was finally not 
enough. One animal turned noisily 
to another, then prodded the 
stick almost through him. 

His outer membrane punctured 
now, his fluids leaked out. Excru- 
ciating pain overcame him. 

He shut off the aching parts 
of his body, placing them to sleep, 
then continued to dodge other 
prods from the short sticks. 

Soon almost every part of his 
brain-tissue anatomy was com- 
partmented and One-Girk-Two 
fell unconscious. 

F rom One-Girk-Two’s cage 
various tribal members could 
be seen in various positions of 
sitting, squatting or walking 
around the community fire. 
Twisted fibers from a tough tree 
root formed the bars of the cage. 
He had already learned that his 
weak body acids would not burn 
the bars. Most of his body tissues 
were closed off, preventing the 
continuous pain from searing 
through his consciousness. 

Water was never offered to him 
and he had to absorb what liquids 



he could from the humidity of 
the atmosphere — a pitiful quan- 
tity, barely allowing his normal 
biological functions to proceed. 
Food consisted of scraps of gar- 
bage thrown by amused by- 
standers and only through trial 
and error had he learned which 
scraps were sufficiently fine-grain- 
ed to be absorbed by his external 
membrane. 

Some food had to be washed 
by exudations of his body fluids, 
breaking down their cellular struc- 
ture further so that he could ab- 
sorb some of the nutrients. Other 
particles had to be left to rot 
until microorganisms had suffici- 
ently broken up the materials. 
All these ways to provide himself 
with life-giving nourishment were 
new, invented by himself out of 
necessity. 

Though all these primitive con- 
ditions for survival were painful 
and burdensome, nothing hurt 
One-Girk-Two so much as the 
loss of his signal generator. With- 
out that precious device, life itself 
was unimportant — ^for without the 
opportunity to become a member 
of a Unit he was nothing. 

A spark of hope continued to 
linger within him. He could see 
the si)jnal generator hanging on 
the chiefs neck. It was a nigged 
mechanism and might still be op- 
erating in spite of the daily abuse 
it received. 

One-Girk-Two often directed 
the total mass of his tissues into 

IF 



J36 




search for a solution to his present 
plight. A slight suggestion of es- 
cape — a bare, tenuous possibil- 
ity — offered itself. To that pos- 
sibility, he devoted every bit of 
conscious neural tissue. 

Evening was the time for peace- 
ful tribal social gatherings. At that 
time, fishermen, hunters and their 
trainees, the children, relaxed. 
Sleep was not far away. Daylight 
was nearly gone and few daily 
activities remained to be per- 
formed. 

Females of the tribe usually 
enclosed the very young in bril- 
liant red skinfolds to protect them 
from the cold. The older children, 
more self-sufficient, followed the 
footsteps of their assigned teacher 
or formed into larger groups for 
games. 

Frequently a group of young- 
sters would assemble outside One- 
Girk-Two’s cage to prod him with 
sticks, throw pebbles, sand or 
garbage or simply to stand quietly 
and stare from large unblinking 
eyes. 

One of the primitive alien chil- 
dren in particular had sustained a 
curiosity unusual for the group. 
He had never teased or thrown 
objects. He had come night after 
night to stare and seemingly to 
study One-Girk-Two. 

One-Girk-Two always looked 
forward to this event — for in 
that small alien’s behavior lay the 
tiny, almost insignificant possibil- 
ity of his survival. He had deter- 

TO THE LAST RITE! 



mined to learn the tribe’s language 
and to develop facility in it. The 
small, unblinking male child who 
was such a frequent visitor was 
his major key to the effort. 

There were always children 
surrounding the cage who prodded 
or teased; the opportunity to con- 
tact this particular male child was 
not easy to come by. The strategy 
finally developed was simple. 
Whenever the thoughtful male 
child appeared. One - Girk - Two 
would immediately sidle over to 
him, placing his body as close to 
the child as possible. There was. 
nothing more he could do until 
he learned the language. 

Meanwhile he absorbed noises 
and patterns of behavior associ- 
ated with his captors’ speaking 
modes. Had his body not been 
so totally injured and compart- 
mented he might have learned far 
more rapidly than he did. But he 
did learn. 

The day finally arrived when 
persistent use of his remaining in- 
tegrative functions brought the 
language to his abnormally small 
conscious portion and, with the 
exception of some ambiguities 
here and there, he knew that he 
was ready for his initial speech 
attempts. He tried them on his 
prospective friend when other 
children were not around. 

T he noises were not too 
easily recognizable as 
speech, for One - Girk - Two’s 



137 




membrane was not capable of im- 
itating sounds struck from needle- 
sharp dentures. At first the child 
to whom they were directed was 
delighted with the new phenome- 
non and invited everyone to hear 
the sounds. Prodding by sticks in- 
creased’ until he and the others 
learned that One - Girk - Two 
immediately shut off the sounds 
under such circumstances. Then, 
for many weeks, all prodding 
ceased and One - Girk - Two re- 
warded their behavior by attempt- 
ing his peculiar speech patterns 
at every opportunity. 

Visiting tribesmen from other 
geographical regions were fascin- 
ated with One-Girk-Two and 
soon great status was associated 
with the tribe that possessed him. 
His speech improved slowly. He 
rewarded Sutic, the young male 
he had chosen for a friend, by 
reserving for him a true descrip- 
tion of his origins. 

“I am One-Girk-Two from 
another world beyond your sun. 
I am here to complete my ap- 
prenticeship before becoming a 
One-Girk-One when, should I 
pass the final test, I become a 
member of a Unit.” 

Such concepts as Unit and One- 
Girk-Two were exceedingly dif- 
ficult to communicate to the prim- 
itive alien and were perhaps never 
made clear. The idea of a “world 
beyond your sun” was not quite 
so difficult to convey, for Sutic 
was familiar with worlds beyond 



the desert, beyond the mountain, 
bevond the trees, beyond life and 
so on. And soon Sutic’s special 
knowledge of the captive raised 
him in the esteem of his elders. 

In as short a time as possible - 
One - Girk - Two made his re- 
quest. 

“I must have the box hanging 
around your chiefs neck. Without 
it I will not continue to live,” he 
pleaded. 

“My grandfather places much 
sebble on the box. He would never 
part with it.” 

One - Girk - Two was unable 
to translate the word sebble. He 
inferred that it represented pres- 
tige or magic. 

Cold weather set in, causing 
One - Girk - Two to place his 
major efforts on maintaining his 
body temperature. He assumed 
the shape of a sphere in order 
to conserve the maximum amount 
of heat. He explained to Sutic, 
who acquired for him a place 
nearer the ever-present campfire 
and caused animal hides to be 
placed inside his cage. But One- 
Girk-Two continued to be unable 
to shake Sutic’s reluctance to ap- 
proach his grandfather on the sub- 
ject of the box. 

His watchers, high above, 
surely knew where he was and 
what was happening to him for 
they had broad and mysterious 
powers belonging only to the Unit 
level. But the rules for trial were 
clear and specific. He must main- 



138 




tain signal contact with them and 
be ready to respond to their signal 
at any time they initiated the 
contact. Soon, he knew, he would 
be stranded among these aliens 
should he fail to maintain his 
proper signal in the generator. 

He might already be stranded. 
There was no way to tell. During 
the period of time that his signal 
generator had been worn by the 
chief, signals may already have 
come and passed him by. If this 
were the case, all his efforts to 
retrieve the box were already too 
late. He did not know. 

Slowly One - Girk - Two be- 
came part of the tradition of Su- 
tic’s tribe, the Corogers. The cold 
season passed; the windy season 
passed and was followed by the 
hot season. The sun blazed mer- 
cilessly. One - Girk - Two was 
given his physical freedom as a 
pet of the tribe. 

He found many^excuses to re- 
main by the chiefs side and near 
the signal generator. One was that 
part of his mission might prove to 
be to acquire a thorough knowl- 
edge of the tribe — and what 
better observation post? Another 
was that an opportunity to use 
the signal generator might come. 

He learned that the tribe’s life 
was stable in both births and 
deaths. Food was easy to reach 
in the streams or in the foothills 
and deserts. The climate was not 
too immoderate for the Corogers’ 
genetic heritage and their tempers, 

TO THE LAST RITE! 



though savage, were for the most 
part even. The tribe lived an 
unassuming life — and within this 
pastoral but primitive framework 
the more civilized but incomplete 
One - Girk - Two watched and 
waited. 

He reflected on the lessons he 
must learn on this venture, their 
possible content, their significance 
with respect to Girk life, evolu- 
tion and development, and his 
particular future role in his cul- 
ture’s matrix. 

IV 

L ife to any Girk is simple 
though it may not appear 
so to an outsider. Each Girk is 
born of the apparently undiffer- 
entiated parent mass of cellular 
tissue that once covered the floor 
of his planet’s single ocean. 

Variations in temperature and 
nutrients surrounding the parent 
tissue cause a differing in the type 
and kind of budding which, when 
pulled out from the parent, be- 
comes a particular kind of Girk. 
Usually the One-Girks stem from 
the hotter, equatorial regions. 
The Two-Girks — the bodies ’ — 
usually come from the slightly 
cooler regions. The Three-Girks 
— the mobiles of various sizes 
and shapes — come from even 
cooler regions. 

The Twelve-Girks — tiny re- 
productive cellular clust(*rs which 
might eventually return to the 



139 




parent body at some point distant 
in geography and time — usually 
come from the coldest regions of 
aU. 

One-Girk-Two quite often re- 
flected on the early beginnings of 
his race — the complexities and 
simplicities, the beauty and right- 
ness. He contrasted his race’s 
evolutionary path against that of 
his captors, the Corogers, noting 
their strange incompleteness and 
nonunified nature — they were 
almost like single Girks for life. 
Yet he often marveled that they 
had brains, body, legs and arms 
and other characteristics which 
operated with singleness of pur- 
pose much like a Unit. 

Thousands of years earlier One- 
Girks, Two-Girks and all other 
Girk components, separated from 
parent, were tossed and moved by 
the winds and the sea currents 
more or less at random across the 
planet’s single ocean. They inter- 
mingled, one kind of component 
with another until, by chance 
alone, a complete Unit was created 
and civilization evolved. The 
early Units, though defective in 
philosophy and behavior, managed 
to create a more advanced devel- 
opmental stage, opening to their 
more mature senses and thinking 
capacity many secrets of the phys- 
ic^ world. 

Eventually the application of 
science to the formation Units 
brought about the design of a sel- 
ection process whereby only those 



components — One - Girk - Ones, 
Two - Girk - Ones and so forth 
— which were most fit, became 
part of the completed Units. 

One - Girk - Two reflected on 
the precision and desirability 
of the tests. The Girk culture had 
become immensely improved in 
the period of only one generation. 
Subsequent refinements of the 
tests had brought it to greater 
heights. One - Girk - Two had 
been subjected to hundreds of 
tests which measured his ability 
to utilize both inductive and de- 
ductive reasoning as well as his 
ability to solve intuitional and 
associational insight-action pro- 
blems. 

What was the exact extent of 
his powers? 

He reflected on his latest 
change in knowledge and behav- 
ior. He had killed. He had suf- 
fered great pain, indignities and 
humiliations at the hands of primi- 
tive, backward, alien beings. Yet, 
he had striven, in a sense, to 
join his tormentors. Did this mean 
that he had little by little realized 
that these beings, too, had a right 
to grow and to evolve in their own 
manner? 

He examined the principle of 
cooperation between dien species 
— himself and the Corogers. 

One - Girk - Two was able to 
teach his captors some simple 
things. One of these was the idea 
and use of the wheel. Another 
was simpler in technique but re- 

IF 



140 




;ulted in more praise — how to 
nake fire. This second benefit 
Teed the primitives from constant 
flame-guarding. 

Such was the value placed on 
this bestowal that Sutic’s grand- 
father, in great ceremony and in 
front of the whole tribe,, said, 
“You have made us a gift of much 
value. We no longer have the right 
to retain that which you desire so 
strongly. Take the box as a gift 
in return for your gift of fire- 
making to us.” 

One - Girk - Two was over- 
joyed. He checked the box and 
found that his Girk monitor was 
still watching and observing his 
behavior. Strapping the signal gen- 
erator once more to his form 
with animal thongs, he proudly 
made his way through the tribe, 
knowing a feeling of oneness and 
love for these strange beings. 
Somehow, in some way, this primi- 
tive group of aliens had to be 
componentized. That, he thought, 
should be his greatest and best 
gift to them. 

He could work from several 
different levels. Already these 
primitives had a well-developed 
social structure which tended to 
specialize activities within a uni- 
tary whole. It could be improved 
upon. And biological unitization 
could be made to take place at 
another level — but what would 
be the end result? If he changed 
these creatures — would they still 
be his friends and he theirs? 

TO THE LAST RITE! 



One - Girk - Two contemplated 
in silence the mightiest task that 
had as yet occurred to him — if 
he could accomplish it. To change 
the biological nature of a life-form 
— was that not a kind of destruc- 
tion, death, no matter what the 
reasoning behind it? Would he not 
be using on his friends a weapon 
deadlier than the heat-beam he 
had lost? After long, quiet even- 
ings of thought he finally formed 
a conclusion. 

Though minor help, like the 
wheel and the fire-making, could 
be given to less developed beings 
tnan himself, it was not his place 
to change their natural organic 
integrity. 

A s THOUGH triggered by that 
very thought. One - Girk - 
Two’s signal came. Strangely, he 
was unexcited and ready for it, 
as could easily be determined by 
the deliberate manner in which 
he pushed the return signal in 
proper code sequence. Then he 
waited. 

High in the sky, like a crystal- 
line jewel sparkling brighdy in 
strong sunshine, hung the energy- 
balloon. It would be operated by 
a Unit from the ship overhead, 
just as it had been on his arrival 
upon the planet’s crust so many 
months before. 

As the bright point of light be- 
came even bigger and brighter, 
the activities of the Corogers 
ceased. 



141 





The light became larger and ex- 
panded. The craft became visible. 

Its outlines became clearer, rep- 
resenting nothing more or less 
than a bubble with nothing inside. 
It stopped near One-Girk-Two, 
controlled entirely by the signal 
generator, and it waited. He 
moved to, it pushing his small 
body against the outer wall, thus 
blending himself with the wall 
itself. To One Girk - Two’s 




primitive friends it appeared as 
though he had walked through the 
bubble’s walls. 

One - Girk - Two turned to 
watch the tribe from inside the 
hollow sphere. This was truly a 
parting, for he would have to wait 
for them to come to the Unit 
stage — or its equivalent — in 
their own time and in their own 
peculiar manner. 

Sadly he removed his sig- 
nal generator, pushed it through 
the bubble’s w^l and dropped it 
at the feet of Sutic, the first friend 



he had known anywhere. A great 
noise rose from the mouths and 
throats of the tribe. 

One-Girk-Two knew he had 
passed the physical survival por- 
tion of his test. Had he also pass- 
ed the philosophical, unknown 
portion? He did not know more 
than that love in all its forms must 
represent great risks and he had 
just taken all of them. What did 
this mean? 

The Unit guiding the bubble of 
forces upward would give him his 
answer. •

TO THE LAST RITE! 



143 






M ost pulp-magazine publish- 
ing came to an end some 
twenty years ago because of what 
might be termed “Gresham’s Law” 
of popular literature: Bad fiction 
tends to drive out the good from 
the market place. If a good maga- 
zine became popular, fifty cheap 
imitations were rushed to the 
stands. This syphoned off some 
sales of the good one and also dis- 
gusted many readers who might 
have liked such stories if they had 
found good examples. 

So far, this hasn’t happened to 
science-fiction magazines. But 
there is some evidence that a trend 
in that direction is developing in 
the books that bear our label. 
Science fiction is a marketable 
commodity; it may not sell in vast 



quantities, but books carrying the 
term prominently do rather better 
than many other categories. And 
consequently, the men who ride 
trends are beginning to issue al- 
most anything on which they can 
put the words that seem to draw 
readers. 

The latest— and to my mind, 
most flagrant — case is Holding 
Your Eight Hands, An Anthol- 
ogy of Science Fiction Verse, 
edited by Edward Lucie-Smith 
(Doubleday, $1.95). There are 
some examples of the work of 
science-fiction and fantasy writers 
included: Aldiss, Disch and 

Lovecraft among them. There 
are also a number of pieces from 
poets that deal with subjects now 
in the news which were once used 



144 




n science fiction — and which 
ivere whipped to death back in 
the dim days of the beat poets. 
A^nything goes. While Robert Con- 
quest writes of science fiction in 
genuine verse, George MacBeth 
fills much more space with a 
bunch of folksy prose paragraphs 
about Herman Kahn’s theories. 
There’s little here to gladden the 
heart of either a science-fiction 
fan or the general reader. Yet 
it will probably get better reviews 
than most science fiction; and be- 
cause of the label, it may well 
sell more copies than most books 
of poetry today. Ah, well. 

The poets of the day, 
Banging on wash-tub bottoms, 
Sing in cacophony 
Sans scan, sans rhyme, sans 
reasons. 

They write of archetypes, 
Speak atom bombs and fission. 
And when the markers right 
They call it science fiction. 
Their critic daisy chains. 

In quid pro quo ovations, 
Extol their latest fads 
— And fraud them publication. 

Such an attempt to ride the 
market trends is a little exception- 
al, of course. A more normal trick 
is to dig back through old maga- 
zine issues to find something that 
nobody else wanted and to hail 
it as a classic — or to put it out as 
if it were something fresh from 
the writer, in some cases. Often, 

READING ROOM 



such works aren’t even given a 
superficial revision to bring them 
into line with current events. 

T he rose, by Charles L. 

Harness (Berkley, 600), is 
an example of the “great lost 
classic” ploy. There’s no effort 
to conceal that this is from the 
volume Authentic Science Fiction 
of 1953. Instead, the publishers 
boast of the fact, as if they were 
doing us a great favor in bringing 
us this rare jewel that no Ameri- 
can magazine had the exquisite 
taste to publish. The point is 
further emphasized in a foreword 
by Michael Moorcock which in- 
dicates that this is a landmark 
novel by one of the greatest of 
science-fiction writers. 

I have no quarrel with his rat- 
i*)g of Harness. The man estab- 
lished himself as a major writer 
with a single short novel. Flight 
into Yesterday, some twenty years 
ago. And despite a meager output, 
his reputation has deservedly re- 
mained high. 

Even the best writers, however, 
may lose perspective on some 
story dear to their hearts, with 
residts that should best be for- 
given and forgotten quickly. 

The Rose has all the complexity 
for which Harness is noted, but 
it has very little underneath to 
justify all the themes and counter- 
themes. Instead, it seems to fall 
back on artiness — a grave danger 
to any story which tries to talk 

145 




about art as something more than 
a product of man’s emotions. 
Much of the basic idea bogs down 
In an attempt to equate Art with 
the functions of science and math- 
ematics as a means of controlling 
whatever Reality may be. 

The story is loaded and over- 
loaded with symbolism. There’s a 
Dancer and a Poet at the center 
of it all. Both are crippled and 
tortured; both are tools of folly. 
There’s an unfinished ballet that 
must be performed, which will 
then do what all of science has 
failed to accomplish. And there’s 
naturally a somewhat tragic mood 
of love. But most of it is as un- 
convincing as the description of 
the dance, which is so obviously 
impossible as a ballet that every- 
thing seems a little ridiculous. 

The whole thing comes off as 
an unhappy bit of what I can only 
call adolescent fiction. It takes on 
the vague profundity of an ado- 
lescent’s first struggles for a sense 
of values and importance — with 
everything in capital letters to con- 
ceal the fact that too much of the 
fury involves nothing but empty 
symbols — the Reality of Art, the 
Meaning of Existence, and such. 
There’s a great deal of color in 
some of the scenes, but the scenes 
take place to fill empty spaces, 
rath^ than giving us any true pic- 
ture of what is happening 

Anyhow, it isn’t a novel. The 
book is padded out with a number 
of shorter pieces to bring this 



novella up to publishable size. 
None of the stories are Harness 
at his best. 

T he ring of ritournel, by 
Charles L. Harness (Berk- 
ley, 600), is another matter. This 
is an original novel — full-length 
and current. Many of the themes 
that are vaguely hinted or heavy- 
handed in the older story are given 
the treatment they deserve. Art 
is still with us, but now it is in 
context with the worlds of science 
and religion. The texture and com- 
plexity of Harness’ writing comes 
through much better. And 
the characters are more than mere 
symbols. The poet, in particular, 
emerges in twisted brilliance 
through the eyes of the main char- 
acter, his brother. 

Like much of Harness’ work, 
this isn’t always easy to follow. 
But there is a fascination to it, 
and a feeling in the end that the 
events have justified the effort re- 
quired to understand them. 

Perhaps the most unwisely re- 
printed writer in our field has 
been Edmond Hamilton. Over a 
course of four decades, he has 
steadily improved his vision and 
his cr^t; today he is among the 
best writers of adventure science 
fiction, and any new book by him 
is one I buy automatically. 

Publishers normally list the date 
and source of the original 
appearance on the copyright page, 
so it shouldn’t be too hard to 



146 



IF 




determine whether a book is a 
reprint from the morgue of our 
beginnings despite title changes. 
Yet most readers aren’t that so- 
phisticated. I’ve heard Hamilton 
damned by fairly perceptive read- 
ers on the basis of work done 
forty years ago, when the writing 
standards of the whole field were 
much different. 

Now there’s a new batch of 
novels by Hamilton that don’t rep- 
resent his best efforts. 

There was nothing wrong with 
the Captain Future stories when 
they appeared in the magazines 
twenty years ago. They were 
meant to be series stories based 
on a mechanical formula, like 
many other series characters from 
the pulp era. They were fast- 
action novels in which the plotting 
was almost as fixed as the chore- 
ography of a traditional ballet. 
Hamilton turned them out at reg- 
ular intervals. His writing was 
honest for the purpose, but was 
never intended to represent any- 
thing but formula work. 

Now the publishers of Popular 
Library — who own the original 
copyright from the magazines — 
are issuing the Captain Future 
stories as soft-cover books. There 
is no attempt to deceive, of coui^; 
the copy on the back cover clearly 
identifies each book as a Captain 
Future novel. 

That is fine for the readers who 
already know who and what the 
Captain was. Unfortunately, of 

READING ROOM 



the book-buying science-fiction 
public, this probably represents 
less than 20%. Any unaware 
reader who picks up Hamilton’s 
Outlaw World (Popular Library, 
600) is risking disappointment if 
he expects a story of the quality 
of other work by the same man. 
The characterization is skimpy 
and routine, because the Captain 
and his rather contrived crew are 
little more than easily identified 
pieces in a regular game. And 
the story is skimpy because it was 
written to length and to schedule, 
rather than as a tale to stand on 
its own merits. Ifs good fun for 
those who know and like the rules 
of that game, but not for the 
unaware. 

T o SEE how far below Ham- 
ilton’s current standard the 
Captain Future stories are, one 
ne^ only turn to his latest series, 
such as World of the Starwolves 
(Ace, 500). This is clearly 
labeled StarwolJ No. 3 so there 
can be no confusion as to its being 
a series, and it’s a full-sized soft- 
cover at a rather reasonable price. 

This shows evidence of having 
been designed for book publica- 
tion, even though meant as a 
series. Morgan Chane, the hero, 
has been brought up by the outlaw 
starwolves and is now opposed to 
them. But beyond that basic situ- 
ation and some parts of his char- 
acter, the book shows a consider- 
able flexibility in the choice 

147 




of situation and secondary charac- 
ters. It is also an action story — 
but the action is keyed to a more 
adult audience, with leisure to 
build up the suspense and mood, 
rather than the need to spring 
immediately into full action. There 
are grays in the mood and in the 
characters, rather than the abso- 
lute good guys and bad guys. 

Furthermore, the reader who 
picks up this book need not under- 
stand even the fact that it is a 
series to enjoy it. Hamilton has 
time and space to develop the 
basic facts of Chane’s background, 
and the story otherwise might be 
any adventure novel. 

The Starwolf series isn’t the 
best of Hamilton — probably no 
writer can do his best work 
around any series situation; but it 
is enjoyable, and by all odds the 
best deliberate series I’ve come 
across in the field. 

A number of books written for 
the teen-age market (which us- 
ually means somewhere between 
10 and 14) are now appearing in 
soft covers, with no indication of 
their original purpose. In the case 
of Andre Norton and most Hein- 
lein “juveniles,” this doesn’t much 
matter; they were never very 
tightly geared to any particular 
age. But in other books, the hand- 
ling isn’t one that will completely 
please an adult. 

One of my books. Attack from 
Atlantis (Tempo Books, 75tf), 
deals with a civilization that has 



existed for millennia on the sea 
bottom until an atomic submarine 
discovers it. (It’s not the Atlan- 
tis!) This was written in 1953^ 
when atomic subs were fairly 
novel and before men had reached 
great depths. The foreword and 
some of the early subject matter 
are based on what has not yet 
been done, and should have been 
revised, along with a small amount 
that was deliberately written for 
the young reader. Yet when the 
soft-cover rights were purchased, 
no opportunity for revision was 
offered; nor is ±ere any sign that 
the editor took the trouble to cut 
out a few references that were 
of no use and are now out of date. 

It would be hard to blame an 
adult who decided to browse 
through science fiction and picked 
my book for feeling that the field 
is kid stuff. Yet such a reader, 
unfamiliar with most science fic- 
tion, might be attracted to the 
book by the use of the term 
“Atlantis” in the title. 

It was an honest book in its 
original intent, I feel. But I’m a 
little unhappy to see it picked up 
by an unfamiliar reader who de- 
cided to sample this science-fic- 
tion stuff people talk about. 

If these various forms of rush- 
ing almost anything called science 
fiction into print harm the field 
as a market, however, it will be 
only partly the fault of the pub- 
lishers. TTie writers must share 
some measure of responsibility 

IF 



148 




when they control the rights. All 
of us — and I certainly include 
myself — must obviously start de- 
manding and exercising our right 
to revise anything that can be 
made suitable for a broader or 
different market; and we must 
sometimes refuse to sell rights to 
stories that really should no longer 
be in print. 

Until this Utopia arrives, the 
reader can only protect himself by 
watching the copyright notices and 
by doing more than read the blurb 
inside and on the back cover. 
Most stores will permit a buyer to 
glance over the first couple of 
pages of a book, if he shows signs 
of paying for what he likes, rather 
than using the store as a library. 
It’s usually possible to tell in those 
two pages whether a book is of 
the level wanted. There’s no law 
that forbids us screaming a bit in 
a letter to the publisher when we 
feel there was misrepresentation; 
but how much good that does is 
anybody’s guess. 

O N A more pleasant level, 
there’s a book where no 
faintest taint of misrepresentation 
can be suspected. Decision at 
Donna, by Anne McCaffrey (Bal- 
lentine Books, 75<), is an 
original first published in 1969. 
It’s a book written for adults, 
completely independent of any 
others by the same author, and it 
includes enough information 
about itself in the blurbs for the 



reader to make a fair guess as to 
what he will get. 

What he gets is a good adven- 
ture story. The few human colon- 
ists on Doona are struggling to 
make their world ready for the 
larger horde of settlers to come 
when they run into an unexpected 
problem. Another race is discov- 
ered on Doona — a world sup- 
posedly carefully checked to make 
sure it has no intelligent life. The 
colonists from Earth find some 
evidence that the aliens may even 
be superior in intelligence — yet 
they still can find no evidence for 
a history of evolution to intelli- 
gence on the planet. 

If the aliens are natives. Earth’s 
government is going to make the 
humans leave the planet — but a 
return to overcrowded Earth is 
a nightmare to these social misfits 
up there. On the other hand, 
if it turns out that these aliens 
come from some other world (de- 
spite their seeming lack of space 
ships), the problem is one for 
which there is no clear answer, 
but one which each government 
bureau will decide to take over 
in absolute and conflicting author- 
ity. 

It’s a nice situation, well hand- 
led, and with aliens that are suf- 
ficiently believable and interesting 
to add greatly to the story. 

Anne McCaffrey has avoided 
the too-easy trap of typing herself, 
I’m glad to see. Her previous 
work has been almost exclusively 



READING ROOM

told from the point of view of a 
female character — dragonrider, 
singing ship, or what have you. 
Here she uses a male as her pro- 
tagonist. She slips into the 
masculine attitude easily and con- 
vincingly, and her female charac- 
ters are seen as they would be 
viewed through the eyes of a man. 

She has also depended mostly 
on usihg characters with singular 
powers, such as telepathy or the 
cyborg awareness of her ^ip. The 
people on Doona have no such 
tricks up their sleeves; they have

MACHINES THAT TEACH 

FREDERIK POHL 



P ERRY A. CHAPDELAINE, whoSC 
stories you’ve been reading in 
these pages for some time, is 
clearly a writer with an imagina- 
tive and original mind. He’s not 
only a writer — the rest of his 
time he works as a mathematics 
professor at Tennessee A. & I., 
a land-grant college in Nashville, 
and in that capacity he also shows 
a lot of imagination and original- 
ity. His latest exploit is to install 
and direct one of the first and 
most complete research labora- 
tories in Computer Aided Instruc- 
tion — C.A.I., for short — in the 
country. 

Recently we had the privilege 
of visiting Tennessee A. & I. and 
went back to school one morning. 
Our teacher wasn’t human. In 
fact, our teacher wasn’t even in 
Tennessee. Teacher was actually 
a Pt)P-10 computer located on 
the campus of Stanford University, 
some thousands of miles away in 
California, A smaller and some- 
what dumber PDP-8 computer sat 
humming and winking at us in 
the classroom but its function was 
only that of a sort of mechanized 
telephone operator. It took the 
messages involved in our own 



math lesson and those of the othei 
students sitting at a score of tele- 
type consoles in the room, com- 
bined them and passed them on 
to California. 

We’ve “talked” with computers 
before — played 3-D tic-tac-toe 
and have done prime-number 
problems with the Project MAC 
array at M.I.T. We’ve shot pool 
against that RCA program in 
Princeton, N.J. — but this deal 
was different. This was not a de- 
monstration program or a game. 
This was the real thing. We were 
actually being educated. (High 
time, too!) 

Y ou arrive in the classroom 
at the appointed time and sit 
in front of the teletype. You type 
out your number and your first 
name. Two thousand mUes away 
the computer recognizes you and 
types out your last name to prove 
it, along with the drill number 
for your current lesson and a short 
statement of what it’s going to be 
about. (“This is a lesson on com- 
mon and decimal fractions.” Or, 
“This is a lesson on addition.”) 
And it proceeds at once to give 
you a problem. 



153 




It types out: 84 X. 9. 

Then it waits for about ten 
seconds. If you give it the right 
answer, it goes on to the next 
problem. If you don’t give it any 
answer at all, it repeats the ques- 
tion. If you give it a wrong an- 
swer, it types, “No, try again.” If 
you still give it a wrong answer, it 
types, “No, the correct answer is 
75.6, try again,” and then repeats 
the question. And at the end of 
the drill, consisting of maybe 35 
problems, it grades you and bids 
you farewell: “22 Apr. 1969. 35 
problems with 54 percent correct 
in 683 seconds. Goodbye, 
Frederik. Please tear off on the 
dotted line.” 

(One thing. We really do 
know how much 84 X. 9 is — at 
least most of the time. The score 
we got we have faithfully repro- 
duced but we feel we should men- 
tion it was a bum rap. It was that 
low because we kept deliberately 
giving wrong answers to see what 
the machine would do. Actually, 
we could have easily gotten at 
least 60.) 

Now, all of this will never re- 
place the teacher, a fact well 
known to Perry Chapdelaine, to 
his Dean of the Department of 
Physics and Mathematics, Dr. 
Sadie Gasaway, to his Adminis- 
trative Assistant, Mrs. Deitra Tay- 
lor, to Eh*. Patrick Suppes, Direc- 
tor of the Institute for Mathe- 
matical Studies" in the Social Sci- 
ences at Stanford, who developed 

154 



the program in the first place, and 
to all the other intelligent and 
able people involved. What it will 
do is make it possible for teachers 
to teach. 

The CAI computer program is 
unbeatably patient and reliable 
and so it is unbeatable at drill and 
review. It has no personality hang- 
ups. It doesn’t take a dislike to any 
student because of his color, creed 
or length of hair. It has no tend- 
ency to show off in front of the 
English teacher across the hall, or 
to take time out for a lecture on 
why marijuana will rot your 
brains. It will just keep on giving 
you problems and checking your 
answers. If it finds you are getting 
them right it will move you up to 
harder problems. If it finds you’re 
missing most of them it will slip 
in an easier set. And it will stay 
right with you for as long as you 
are willing to sit there and learn. 

And so if you come to college 
and realize you goofed off on a 
little too much of your high- 
school math, CAI is your best 
friend — and your teacher’s. For 
you it provides remedial instruc- 
tion at your own level. For your 
teacher — he doesn’t have to hold 
up the whole class while he drills 
you in what you should have 
learned four years ago. 

Fellows, meet the computer. 
Computer, meet the human race. 
You might as well get to know 
each other. You’re going to be 
working very closely together. •

Dear Editor: 

In your editorial to the May If 
you stated that much of the **New 
Whatchamacallit science fiction** 
was concerned with ** petty antiheroes 
who whine over the lot of mankind 
but do nothing about it,** That may 
be true of mainstream fiction, but 
it is hardly true of even New Wave 
science fiction, and / believe that 
you realize that as well as /. I*ve 
read a fair sampling of New Wave, 
and most of the protagonists are no 
John Carters or Kim Kinnisons, but 
they fall under the heading of heroes. 
They are not the perfect human 
beings the aforesaid two are, but 
they are not meant to be. They are 
mepnt to be fallible, ordinary men, 
and they illustrate the hero in us all, 
Sam in Lord of Light, Michael 
Valentine Smith, and certainly Jack 
Barron did not want to be heroes. 
They could have copped out but 
didn*t. They did what they had to 
do. Even the characters of Harlan 
Ellison have the touch of greatness 
in them. 

Science fiction is proud that it 
works away from the mainstream, 
S-f fans do not need mainstream 
heroes like Hemingway*s Jake 
Barnes because mankind does not 
nepd Jake Barnes. Because certain 
writers introduce new techniques in- 



to s-f writing, the fans and writers 
have become afraid that Jake Barnes 
will become the model for heroes. 
So they condemn New Wave as a 
whole, and then praise Ellison, Disch 
and all the rest as individuals. Then 
they overlook the fact that **The 
Holmes-Ginsbook Device** is as New 
Wave as can be, wih superb state- 
ments on human motives. Asimov*s 
story is concerned with anti-heroes, 
and his story is a classic, but there 
is no indication that his glory- 
hoggers will become models for pro- 
tagonists. The fans and writers are^ 
in reality paranoid about the entire 
Issue, just as many are paranoid 
about sex in a story or elemertts 
of fantasy. You would think an s-f 
fan would be more rational. 

The plot of a story dictates 
whether or not one is a hero or 
an everyday human being, and there^ 
will be stories in which anti-heroes 
will have to be used, and they will 
be good stories. But no one writes 
science fiction because he feels there 
is no hope for mankind. I respect 
your talent as an editor and a writer, 
but your statement shows that you 
have been caught up in the same 
unreasoning fear that '’many fans 
have been caught up in. It is false. 
The New Wave thinks as much of 
mankind as the Old Wave — it*s just 



155 




that the heroes must overcome, on 
top of their villains, their greatest 
foes — themselves. And they d o . 
— Arthur Cover. 

Who ever told you that Roger 
Zelazny was a New Wave writer? 
He denies it vigorously. Who ever 
hinted that Heinlein (even i n 
‘Stranger”) was New Wave? If those 
were the New Wave writers, we’d 
be out in front of the cheering sec- 
tion Furthermore, Sam in the 
Zelazny story showed every sign of 
wanting to be a hero — in fact, 
even a god! Come to think of it, 
he was a god, which is hardly an 
anti-hero; and neither he. Smith, nor 
any others on your list spent any 
time we can remember whining, but 
they did spend quite a bit of time 
doing something about the lot of 
mankind. 

And if you think Isaac Asimov 
is a New Wave writer, you’re about 
to make a mortal enemy of him. 
The “Holmes-Ginsbook” story was 
a lampoon — a takeoff on a very 
successful book about the deliberate 
use of science to get a Nobel prize. 
The protagonists are already there, 
and they’re the model for Asimov’s 
satiric characters. 

Our biggest objection to the anti- 
hero is that he doesn’t try to over- 
come either the villain or himself; 
he doesn’t change or try to change. 
Once a man starts to work on 
himself, he’s out of the whining rut 
and he’s trying to do something — 
and we’re then very much for him. 

Our biggest objection to the New 
Wave comes when it’s neither new 
nor waving, but is simply the old 
slou^ where weak winds and wan 
waves labour nor any wind blows 
free, to steal a phrase from the best 
New Wave poet of the last century. 
Most of the time, it certainly isn’t 
bucking the mainstream, as you 

156 



imply; it’s trying to use old 
mainstream tricks of pseudo- 
experimental writing and 
hopelessness to take over science 
fiction. 

Happens we’re very much opposed 
to science fiction being taken over 
by anyone. We’d like a free market, 
where every story stands or falls on 
its own merits, and be damned to 
the mainstream or slipstream. 
Science fiction has* kept going when 
most popular fiction died because 
it used interesting characters to deal 
with things that make good stories. 
When it picks up any other phony 
construct of how to write and what 
to write, it’s going to join the dodo 
and the Sports Story. It’s the job 
of critics to read the writers; when 
the writers start reading the critics 
for examples, someone has to yell. 
So we yelled. But of course, if you 
like it with namby-pamby anti-heroes 
given the job of making a tough 
planet (even Earth) habitable, 
well. .less power to you, in New 
Wavese! 

Dear Editor: 

You mentioned a particle called 
a tachyon, a theoretical particle 
which cannot go slower than the 
spejed of light. According to my in- 
formation, it has a rest mass of the 
square root of minus one. In one 
of Heinlefn*s novels. Citizen of the 
Galaxy, the hero explains the 
mathematical complexities of faster- 
than-light flight thusly: **So far as 
we are concerned, it's just a 
mathematical concept, like the 
square root of minus one. This 
to me is very remarkable. 

In the last few years, science fic- 
tion has been infected by what is 
called the '*new thing” or *'new 
wave.” Personally, / define the *‘hew 
wave” stories as ones attempting to 
confuse the reader, being shocking, 

IF 




using anti-heroes or having the prime 
object of style rather than content ^ 
though style is the means rather than 
the end. According to John J. Pierce, 
there is a movement called the Se- 
cond Foundation which is for the 
preservation of true science fiction 
and the elimination of the **new 
wave*' type of anti-science fiction, 
with Lester del Rey as the First 
Speaker. Whether Mr. del Rey sanc- 
tions this or not, I think this is a 
very good choice; anyone who says 
2001 was boring is all right by me. 

As a subscriber to If and Galaxy, 
I feel that you have let these maga- 
zines deteriorate over the past couple 
of years. / think Larry Niven is the 
only good regular writer you have, 
although / don't see why he keeps 
on with you. — Matt Hickman, 708 
20th St., West Des Moines, Iowa. 

According to the best information 
available on the tachyon, there is 
no rest mass, just as normal particles 
could have no assigned mass at in- 
finite speed. The tachyon approaches 
infinite mass as it slows toward the 
speed of light. But so far, it’s pretty 
much just a mathematical concept, 
as Heinlein apparently foresaw. As 
to the “Second Foundation” of John 
J. Pierce, Lester del Rey gave his 
permission for his name to be used 
with the honorary title of First 
Speaker; since he’s been speaking 
against the attempt to impose any 
one set of standards on science fic- 
tion for years now, he felt he 
couldn’t deny being Speaker 
whether first or early or whatever. 

Sorry you’ve been disappointed in 
what we have felt to be some fine 
issues of the magazines. But stick 
around, Matt! We’re busy making 
a lot of improvements which should 
soon be showing up. And the reason 
Larry Niven — for whom we share 
your admiration — keeps on with 

HUE AND CRY 



us, perhaps it’s because we’re happy 
to let him write the kind of science 
fiction he wants to write. 

Dear Editor: 

I don't know if I'm going to be 
a new science fiction fan or not! 
I picked up a copy of If for the 
first time and, among other 
fascinating stories, stumbled across 
Perry Chap delaine's **Spork of the 
Ay or." 

The man undoubtedly is mad. If 
his attendants in the white suits will 
let him turn out more "Sporks," I 
hope you print them. Mad or not, 
he can really write — and he just 
might turn me into a permanent 
science fiction fan if they don't take 
away his pad and pencil and put 
him on basket weaving. — Pat Har- 
ris, 3210 Mexico Drive, Nashville, 
Tenn. 

We’ll be printing several more 
stories about Spork, so rest content. 
And we hope you’ll find the other 
stories so much to your liking that 
your fandom will become per- 
manent. Incidentally if you’re really 
concerned about Chapdelaine having 
to weave baskets, you might check 
up on him, since you can’t be too 
far from his home. He certainly 
made a hit with the readers in Ten- 
nessee, judging by the mail we 
receive from there recently! 



Dear Ejditor: 

What is the status of Worlds of 
Fantasy? Is it still extant? It has 
now been something like six months 
since I purchased the first issue and, 
while I have been diligently 
searching through all the magazine 
stands, my efforts have been 
unrewarded. 

I've over-rationalized myself into 
being Conan the Barbarian, Mid- 



Mi 




Twentieth-Century style. Thafs not 
good, but it's better than nothing. 
Kurt Vonnegut once wrote that we 
are only what we pretend to be^ 
so we all should do the best job 
of pretending we can. — P. T. 
Blaine, Cambridge, Mass. 

It could be argued that children 
learn to be adults by pretending they 
are, and some of their games would 
support the idea. Lately, though, it 
seems quite a few adults are trying 
things in reverse. 

We’re happy to say Worlds of 
Fantasy is coming out again. Trou- 
ble with distribution and other 
technical difficulties prevented our 
doing more than one issue until now, 
but the magazine is still extant, and 
a second issue should be on the 
stands this fall, with more to come. 

Dear Editor: 

Maybe your Mr. del Rey can sup- 
ply an answer to a problem that 
has been bothering me, since he, 
seems ready to speculate, on almost 
anything in his column. {But please 
don't use my real name, since 
another teacher here reads your 
magazine,.) One of my students 
noticed that the water level in a 
toilet bowl rose and fell whenever 
ther^ was a high wind. I checked, 
and he was right. But there is no 
way for wind to get into the system 
to make waves, and I can't believe 
there could be ground vibrations 
without our feeling them. This is 
probably silly, but it annoys me. Can 
you te}l me what causes it? — PuZ’ 
zled. 

We passed your problem along, 
and here is what Mr. del Rey says 
will explain it: “Plumbing codes re- 
quire vent pipes from bath fixtures, 
terminating in the standpipe you can 
see sticking up the roof of most 
houses. These form a huge cavity, 

158 



or resonant chamber. When the wind 
supplies energy enough, pressure 
waves are set up in this cavity, just 
as sound pressure waves are set up 
when you blow across the mouth 
of an empty bottle. In this case, 
the system is so large that these 
pressure waves cannot produce 
audible sounds; it would probably 
be on the order of only two or three 
cycles or vibrations a second. But 
the pressure still transmits its effects 
from the air in the cavity to the 
water, which then rises and falls with 
the system frequency.” 

Dear Editor: 

I would like to compliment you on 
the excellence of your magazine 
Worlds of If. No one can say science 
fiction is dying. On the contrary, 
science fiction is on its way up with 
If setting new trends. — Jurgen Hei- 
denreich, 4220 146th Ave., S.E., 
Bellevue, Wash. 

We like your sentiments, 
naturally — but we’re using them here 
to show what happens. Matt Hick- 
man thinks we’re slipping badly, and 
you think we’re on our way up. We 
get a lot of both kinds of comments, 
proving only that each of you is 
right — for himself. All we hope is 
that both find our fiction moving up 
from now on — because we’re going 
to try even harder. And while we like 
both types of criticism, we like it 
even better when you let us know 
which stories you felt were the ones 
going up and which ones indicated 
your idea of a decline. Maybe with 
that type of information, we can find 
stories you’ll both like more often. 

Which reminds us that with 
slightly more space from now on for 
a letter column, we’ll need your 
comments. You set the tone here and 
provide the interesting topics for 
others to discuss. So let’s hear from 
you.

no longer numbered. An imprac- 
tical separation, individual from 
individual, furrowed this crowd of 
strangers. They were no longer 
starched and ironed in their souls. 

Hesitantly Wheat sent a tongue 
of awareness questing inward, 
sensed the absence of the Ma- 
chine. The ritual formulas were 
gone. The sloth and torpor had 
been peeled away. He tested the 
feelings of hatred, of passion, mal- 
ice, pride. 

“It’s dead,’’ he murmured. 

H e led the race back into 
the town, then, rushing along 
streets where the artificial lights 
flickered and behaved with a beau- 
tiful uncontrolled randomness. 

With Wheat leading the way 
the mob plunged down into the 
screened openings which had kept 
them from the nether world 
of the Machine. The scene was 
one repeated all over the world. 
People swarmed through the dark 
tunnels and passages, celebrating 
the pleasures of freedom along 
these once forbidden paths. 

When the last golden wire had 
been torn out, the final delicate 
glass shape crushed — when the 
tunnel girders no longer clanged 
with pounding metal — an unrea- 
sonable silence fell over the land. 

Wheat emerged from the earth 
into white shadows of moonlight. 
He let a strange length of plastic 
fall from his hand. It glowed with 



pearls of dewlight along its length 
and had illuminated his rush 
through the mind passages of the 
Machine. Wheat’s collar was loose 
and he felt a peculiar sense of 
shame. His eyes peered into sooty 
places. Shadows and dust were 
everywhere. He realized he had 
played the buffoon just as the Ma- 
chine had done. A thing had hap- 
pened and he recognized it in the 
way of a prophet. 

“We think we’re free of it,’’ he 
said. 

Somewhere in the wild col- 
lisions beneath the ground he had 
cut his left hand, a jagged slash 
across the knuckles. Exclamation 
points of blood fell from the 
wound into the dust. 

“I cut myself,’’ Wheat said. “I 
did it to myself.’’ 

The thought ignited a searching 
sensation that coursed all through 
him. Wheat carried the feeling all 
the way home to his wife who 
hobbled beautifully out of their 
doorway and stood waiting for him 
in the feeble flickering of a street- 
light. She appeared abashed by all 
the confusion and the unfixed feel- 
ing at the center of her life. She 
had not yet learned how to fill 
out the areas the Machine had 
denied her. 

Wheat stumbled toward her, 
holding his injured hand out as 
though it were the most important 
thing that had ever occurred in 
his universe. 

“You’re drunk,’’ she said. •

the Jann agreed. “But I delayed 
for a time, that thou shoudst real- 
ize it for thyself. None but I shall 
do thee die, no animal, no entity, 
no microbe, no act of nature. But 
it shall be a kind demise, and it 
shall come in exactly fifty years, 
as thou requesteth. I shall always 
be near thee, to see that mine 
oath stands good.'' 

“Great!" 

So the Jann was in fact a body- 
guard, perhaps the most compe- 



tent in all the galaxy, preserving 
him from all dangers until he was 
ninety-two. Its oath had not, tech- 
nically, required that it kill him 
soon; only that no one else be 
allowed to kill him. 

“Well, come on, Jann," Dilling- 
ham cried, remembering some- 
thing current. “We have a student 
strike to deal with, back at the 
University. Oyster will kill me if I 
don't relieve the siege before all 
his files are gone." •

THE SEEDS OF GONYL 

Strang drew a breath as if to 
yell, let it out slowly. 

“Mr. Mallory, you've had a bad 
time of it," he said flatly. “It's 
affected your mind. I can under- 
stand that. You were away from 
home when the attack came. You 
returned to find the city barred 
to you, your family dead. You 
couldn't take it. Your mind let 
go under th« strain and you in- 
vented these zombies of yours to 
enable you to believe your wife 
and children are still living. I'm 
sorry for you — but I can't let 
that interfere with military neces- 
sity. I need men — and women. 
I need them badly." Strang 
glanced across at Brozhny. “I 
can't see that his delusions will 
prevent him from performing basic 
military duties. Lieutenant. Put 
160 



him in D company. First battal- 
ion. And keep a sharp eye on 
him." 

“Just a minute, Strang — " 

“That's Colonel Strang to you, 
private!" 

“Colonel, I don't have time to 
play soldier in your private army. 
My family's in that town — " 

“Forget it," Strang said. 
“You're not going anywhere." 
He lifted the pistol as Mallory 
took a step toward him. “I'm 
warning you for the last time, 
private. The penalty for mutiny 
is the firing squad." 

“The colonel is quite serious," 
Brozhny said and took Mallory's 
arm. “Come along. You're not 
the first man to be drafted into 
the army in wartime."
