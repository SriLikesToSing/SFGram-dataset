THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life's problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

READERS ON ALIENS 



^HAW, I think it was, asked 
^ why a man was antagonistic 
toward him, said, “I can’t im- 
agine why. I haven’t done any- 
thing for him.” The Chinese, 
unlike the rest of us, knew this 
unlovely attribute was not true 
only of the next guy and made 
anyone who saved a life respon- 
sible for that life ever after. Most 
favor-doing, of course, is not life 
and death, so Mark Twain, in 
noting that friendship can survive 
anything but a small loan, had 
more ancient and infinite wisdom 
than the Chinese. 

To claim membership in the 
human race (the flaw, luckily, 
seems confined only to mankind 
— at least so far), I can’t disclaim 
the attribute. But where contri- 
butions to this magazine are con- 
cerned, I couldn’t be more grate- 
ful. 

For instance, to Alex Eisen- 
stein, Chicago, 111., who writes: 
“Having read all your ‘There Are 
Aliens Among Us’ articles, I won- 
der why you never brought in 
the fact that during the Ice Age, 
the Cro-Magnon man had a 
slightly larger brain size (propor- 
tionally) than Homo sapiens 
sapiens (not a misprint; a sub- 
species). Is it possible that this 



is the result of some great (maybe 
accidental) galactic interbreed- 
ing? And what about the fact 
that there are some human beings 
with six (count ’em, six) well- 
proportioned fingers, and that this 
is a dominant, inherited charac- 
teristic? Another galactic hybrid? 
It is a well-known fact, I am sure, 
that all amphibian, reptilian, and 
mammalian animals are based on 
an original five-digit hand or foot, 
and that all of these animals 
(except in this instance) have no 
more than five fingers . 

“There is another and more 
sinister mystery with us now, 
however. Did you ever stop to 
think that the whole order of 
primates might be alien? Consider 
the facts: 1) the blood cells of 
primates differ from other mam- 
malian blood cells in that they 
have no nuclei (at least, they 
contain no nuclei when mature); 
2) the skin of man and the pri- 
mates is tight against the muscu- 
lature . whereas other mammals 
have loose skins (an example of 
this is the loose ‘scruff of the 
neck in cats, rabbits, etc.); 3) and 
finally, the female primates have 
the mammary glands situated on 
the upper part of the torso, while 
the other average, run-of-the-mill 



READERS ON ALIENS 



5 



mammals have them in the lower 
region. 

“Still, I must concede that the 
home planet for us primates 
must be inhabited by some very 
Earth-type creatures. There are 
very many more similarities to 
‘Terran’ mammals than there are 
differences. But who knows?” 

The answer may be in this 
clipping from the Florida Alli- 
gator, a campus newspaper, read- 
ing: “The University of Florida 
has hit a record enrollment of 
12,710 . Male students com- 
prise 8,908 of the total, while 
female students make up the 
other 3,274.” The unnamed stu- 
dent who sent it in shakily points 
out: “The figures for male and 
female students, when subtracted 
from the total, leave 528 of some- 
thing left over. Are they going to 
school here to find out more about 
us?” 

What more is there to find 
out after a few classes and dates? 
It the chap up ahead is right, 
interbreeding could be the answer. 
Check nuclei, skin tight against 
the musculature, mammary gland 
location — in that order, if possi- 
ble. Remember what Mother and 
Dear Abby told you. The some- 
things may not think more of 
you if you wait till after the altar, 
but you'll be able to take out 
skip insurance. That's better than 
sending a rhesus monkey in 
a five-f our -three-two-one-damn- 



countdown rocket to bring them 
back, isn't it? 

Writes Charles Aylworth, Eu- 
gene, Oregon: “The combination 
letter-and-editorial column is the 
best new idea in years . About 
the Aliens Among Us: In .our 
town there is a plumber named 
Jessie Godlove; on his trucks he 
has put ‘Godlove the Plumber.’ 
Another man, Ike Blood, has on 
his fuel trucks ‘Heat with Blood.’ 
It is apparent that religion takes 
a practical turn on Jessie’s world. 
I’d rather not speculate on Ike’s.” 

Gory, no doubt of it, but blood 
is also a great coolant when warm 
instead of cold. By using this trick, 
we mammals carry our thermal 
environment with us into arctic 
or tropics. An external supply for 
heat may be as big an improve- 
ment over ours as ours is over 
reptiles’. Contrary to opinion, not 
all aliens are reticent. So ask. 

Writes Simon A. Stricklen, Jr., 
Auburn, Alabama: “You have 
omitted the most important and 
effective subversion by the in- 
vaders — temporal theft. On the 
alien world, the time is of a much 
poorer quality than ours. It is as 
repellent to them as to us, and 
for this reason they want to con- 
quer us and enjoy our fine time 
while we suffer theirs. For 
example, when I’m with my favor- 
ite girl, my watch says four hours 
have passed, while my senses, in 
which I have much more confi-

dence, inform me it’s only min- 
utes. For the opposite example, 
fishermen friends of mine tell me 
that a whole day can drag by in 
an hour, and I have tnany other 
such reports from reliable sources. 
. With this enormous backlog 
of first-rate time, the aliens could 
jig right in — and imagine us 
trying to repel the invasion, 
dragged down by that irritable, 
depressed feeling caused by a 
softening-up bombardment of sec- 
ond-rate time!” 

Invasion? They’re doing fine 
with their low-cost theft, judging 
by your data, and by the next 
item, sent in by an unknown 
reader, which appeared in the 
Glens Falls, N. Y ., Post-Star: 

NOTICE

this notice, is no longer interested

ternational, political, government,

dersigned’s sole interests are: 
1. Family. 2. Business. 

Clifford B. Witham 

Writes George Bond, Montreal: 
“The mounting evidence does in- 
dubitably show There Are Aliens 
Among Us. Analysis of your anal- 
yses bears out your contention 



that we’re host not to one kind 
or another but a great many. 
Some may indeed intend to take 
over the Earth, but they don’t 
stand a chance; the meek are 
scheduled to inherit it. They also 
seem to be going about the job 
clumsily. Take the Tidal Bore 
at the Petitcodiac River, for in- 
stance, in New Brunswick. The 
Bay of Fundy has the highest 
tides on Earth. At low tide, the 
river bottom is dry enough to 
walk across, and so is the ocean 
floor between St. Andrews and 
Minister’s Island, where you can 
cross by car. A minute later, the 
Tidal Bore comes pounding over 
ocean floor and up the river. And 
near by is Magnetic Hill, which 
hauls a car right up a steep road 
with motor and brakes off. Both 
are great tourist attractions, so 
that part’s smart. But a 60-foot 
tide that gets only an occasional 
victim and a magnetic hill that 
gets none I know of — these are 
weapons? Why, our own highways 
chalk up more kills to the dollar, 
or credit, or whatever unit the 
war profiteers who got these out- 
rageous contracts use!” 

As of even date, Disneyland is 
not trying to swallow up Cali- 
fornia, though it’s every bit as 
good a tourist attraction; the high- 
ways • leading to them could be 
the actual weapons — yet they’re 
built by us — or are they?

J IM Calder studied the minia- 
ture mansion and grounds that 
sat, carefully detailed, on the 
table. 

“If you slip,” said Walters, stand- 
ing at Jim’s elbow, “the whole gang 
will disappear like startled fish. 
There’ll be another thousand ad- 
dicts, and we’ll have the whole 
thing to do over again.” 

Jim ran his hand up the shutter- 
ed, four-story replica tower that 
stood at one corner of the mansion. 
“I’m to knock at the front door and 
say, ‘May I speak to Miss Cyn- 
thia?’ ” 

Walters nodded. “You’ll be tak- 
en inside, you’ll stay overnight, and 
the next morning you will come out 
a door at the rear and drive away. 
You will come directly here, be 
hospitalized and examined, and tell 
us everything you can remember. A 
certified check in five figures will 
be deposited in your account. How 
high the five figures will be depends 
on how much your information is 
worth to us.” 

“Five figures,” said Jim.

Walters took out a cigar and sat 
down on the edge of his desk. 
“That’s right — 10,000 to 99,999.” 
Jim said, “It’s the size of the 
check that makes me hesitate. Am 
I likely to come out of there in a 
box?” 

“No.” Walters stripped the cello- 
phane wrapper off his cigar, lit it, 
and sat frowning. At last he let out 
a long puff of smoke and looked up. 
“We’ve hit this setup twice before 
in the last three years. A city of 
moderate size, a quietly retired 
elderly person in a well-to-do part 
of town, a house so situated that 
people can come and go without 
causing comment.” Walters glanced 
at the model of mansion and 
grounds on the table. “Each time, 
when we were sure where the 
trouble was coming from, we’ve 
raided the place. We caught ad- 
dicts, but otherwise the house was 
empty.” 

“Fingerprints?” 

“The first time, yes, but we could- 
n’t trace them anywhere. The sec- 
ond time, the house burned down 
before we could find out.” 

“What about the addicts, then?” 
“They don’t talk. They — ” 
Walters started to say something, 
then shook his head. “We’re offer- 
ing you a bonus because we don’t 
know what the drug is. These 
people are addicted to something, 
but what? They don’t accept real- 
ity. There are none of the usual 
withdrawal symptoms. A number 



of them have been hospitalized for 
three years and have shown no im- 
provement. We don’t think this 
will happen to you — one exposure 
to it shouldn’t make you an addict 
— but we don’t know. We have a 
lot of angry relatives of these 
people backing us. That’s why we 
can afford to pay you what we think 
the risk is worth.” 

Jim scowled. “Before I make up 
my mind, I’d better see one of these 
addicts.” 

Walters drew thoughtfully on 
his cigar, then nodded and picked 
up the phone. 

T> EHIND the doctor and Wal- 
ters and two white-coated at- 
tendants, Jim went into the room 
at the hospital. The attendants 
stood against the wall. Jim and 
Walters stood near the door and 
watched. 

A blonde girl sat motionless on 
the cot, her head in her hands. 

“Janice,” said the doctor softly. 
“Will you talk to us for just a 
moment?” 

The girl sat unmoving, her head 
in her hands, and stared at the 
floor. 

The doctor dropped to a half- 
kneeling position beside the cot. 
“We want to talk to you, Janice. We 
need your help. Now, I am going to 
talk to you until you show me you 
hear me. You do hear me, don’t you, 
Janice?” 

The girl didn’t move. 



10 



GALAXY 



The doctor repeated her name 
again and again. 

Finally she raised her head and 
looked through him. In a flat, ugly 
voice, she said, “Leave me alone. I 
know what you’re trying to do.” 

“We want to ask you just a few 
questions, Janice.” 

The girl didn’t answer. The doc- 
tor started to say something else, 
but she cut him off. 

“Go away,” she said bitterly. 
“You don’t fool me. You don’t even 
exist. You’re nothing.” She had a 
pretty face, but as her eyes narrow- 
ed and her lips drew slightly away 
from her teeth and she leaned for- 
ward on the cot, bringing her hands 
up, she had a look that tingled the 
hair on the back of Jim’s neck. 

The two attendants moved war- 
ily away from the wall. 

The doctor stayed where he was 
and talked in a low, soothing mono- 
tone. 

The girl’s eyes gradually unfoc- 
used, and she was looking through 
the doctor as if he weren’t there. 
She put her head hard back into her 
hands and stared at the floor. 

The doctor slowly came to his 
feet and stepped back. 

“That’s it,” he told Jim and 
Walters. 

N the way back, Walters drove, 
and Jim sat beside him on the 
front seat. It was just starting to 
get dark outside. Abruptly Walters 
asked, “What did you think of it?” 



Jim moved uneasily. “Are they 
all like that?” 

“No. That’s just one pattern. An 
example of another pattern is the 
man who bought a revolver, shot 
the storekeeper who sold it to him, 
shot the other customer in the store, 
put the gun in his belt, went behind 
the counter and took out a shotgun, 
shot a policeman who came in the 
front door, went outside and took 
a shot at the lights on a theater mar- 
quee; he studied the broken lights 
for a moment, then leaned the shot- 
gun against the storefront, pulled 
out the revolver, blew out the right 
rear tires of three cars parked at 
the curb, stood looking from one 
of the cars to another and said, ‘I 
just can’t be sure, that’s all.’ ” 

Walters slowed slightly as they 
came onto a straight stretch of 
highway and glanced at Jim. “An- 
other policeman shot the man, and 
that ended that. We traced that 
one back to the second place we 
closed up, the place that burned 
down before we could make a 
complete search.” 

“Were these places all run by 
the same people?” 

“Apparently. When we checked 
the dates, we found that the sec- 
ond place didn’t open till after the 
first was closed, and the third place 
till the second was closed. They’ve 
all operated in the same way. But 
the few descriptions we’ve had of 
the people who work there don’t 
check.”

Jim scowled and glanced out 
the window. “What generally hap- 
pens when people go there? Do 
they stay overnight, or what?” 
“The first time, they go to the 
front door, and come out the next 
morning. After that, they generally 
rent one of the row of garages on 
the Jayne Street side of the prop- 
erty, and come back at intervals, 
driving in after dark and staying 
till the next night. They lose in- 
terest in their usual affairs, and 
gradually begin to seem remote to 
the people around them. Finally 
they use up their savings, or other- 
wise come to the end of the money 
they can spend. Then they do like 
the girl we saw tonight, or like the 
man in the gun store, or else they 
follow some other incomprehen- 
sible pattern. By the time we find 
the place and close it up, there 
are seven hundred to twelve hun- 
dred addicts within a fifty-mile 
radius of the town. They all fall 
off their rockers inside the same 
two- to three-week period, and for 
a month after that, the police and 
the hospitals get quite a workout.” 
“Don’t they have any of the 
drug around?” 

“That’s just it. They must get it 
all at the place. They use it there. 
They don’t bring any out.” 

“And when you close the place 
up-” 

“The gang evaporates like a 
sliver of dry ice. They don’t leave 
any drug or other evidence behind. 



This time we’ve got a precise 
model of their layout. We should 
be able to plan a perfect capture. 
But if we just close in on them, 
I’m afraid the same thing will hap- 
pen all over again.” 

“Okay,” said Jim. “I’m your man. 
But if I don’t come out the next 
morning, I want you to come in 
after me.” 

“We will,” said Walters. 

J IM spent a good part of the 
evening thinking about the girl 
he’d seen at the hospital, and the 
gun-store addicts Walters had de- 
scribed. He paced the floor, scowl- 
ing, and several times reached for 
the phone to call Walters and say, 
“No.” A hybrid combination of 
duty and the thought of a five- 
figure check stopped him. 

Finally, unable to stay put, he 
went out into the warm, dark eve- 
ning, got in his car and drove 
around town. On impulse, he 
swung down Jayne Street and 
passed the dark row of rented 
garages Walters had mentioned. A 
car was carefully backing out as 
he passed. He turned at the next 
corner and saw the big, old-fash- 
ioned house moonlit among the 
trees on its own grounds. A faint 
sensation of wrongness bothered 
him, and he pulled to the curb to 
study the house. 

Seen through the trees, the 
house was tall and steep-roofed. It 
reached far back on its land, sur- 



12 



GALAXY 



rounded by close-trimmed lawn 
and shadowy shrubs. The windows 
were tall and narrow, some of them 
closed by louvered shutters. Pale 
light shone out through the narrow 
openings of the shutters. 

Unable to place the sensation of 
wrongness, Jim swung the car 
away from the curb and drove 
home. He parked his car, and, feel- 
ing tired and ready for sleep, 
walked up the dark drive, climbed 
the steps to the porch, and fished 
in his pocket for his keycase. He 
felt for the right key in the dark- 
ness, and moved back onto the 
steps to get a little more light. It 
was almost as dark there as on the 
porch. Puzzled, he glanced up at 
the sky. 

The stars were out, with a 
heavy mass of clouds in the dis- 
tance, and a few small clouds slid- 
ing by overheard. The edge of one 
of the small clouds lit up faintly, 
and as it passed, a pale crescent 
moon hung in the sky. Jim looked 
around. Save for the light in the 
windows, the houses all bulked 
dark. 

Jim went down the steps to his 
car and drove swiftly back along 
Jayne Street. He turned, drove a 
short distance up the side street, 
and parked. 

This time, the outside of the 
huge house was dark. Bright light 
shone out the shutters onto the 
lawn and shrubbery. But the house 
was a dark bulk against the sky. 



Jim swung the car out from the 
curb and drove home slowly. 

f T 1 HE next morning, he went 
early to Walters’ office and 
studied the model that sat on the 
table near the desk. The model, 
painstakingly constructed from en- 
larged photographs, showed noth- 
ing that looked like a camouflaged 
arrangement for softly floodlight- 
ing the walls of the house and the 
grounds. Jim studied the location 
of the trees, looked at the house 
from a number of angles, noticed 
the broken slats in different shut- 
ters on the fourth floor of the 
tower, but saw nothing else he 
hadn’t seen before. 

He called up Walters, who was 
home having breakfast, and with- 
out mentioning details asked, “Is 
this model on your table com- 
plete?” 

Walters’ voice said, “It’s com- 
plete up to three o’clock the day 
before yesterday. We check it reg- 
ularly.” 

Jim thanked him and hung up, 
unsatisfied. He knelt down and put 
his eye in the position of a man in 
the street in front of the house. He 
noticed that certain parts of the 
trees were blocked off from view 
by the mansion. Some of these 
parts could be photographed from 
a light plane flying overhead, but 
other positions would be hidden 
by foliage. Jim told himself that 
floodlights must be hidden high in 



MIND PARTNER 



13 



the trees, in such a way that they 
could simulate moonlight. 

In that case, the question was— 
why? 

Jim studied the model. He was 
bothered by much the same sensa- 
tion as that of a man examining the 
random parts of a jigsaw puzzle. 
The first few pieces fitted together, 
the shapes and colors matched, but 
they didn’t seem to add up to any- 
thing he had ever seen before. 

A S he drove out to the house, 
** the day was cool and clear. 

The house itself, by daylight, 
seemed to combine grace, size, and 
a sort of starched aloofness. It was 
painted a pale lavender, with a 
very dark, steeply slanting roof. 
Tall arching trees rose above it, 
shading parts of the roof, the 
grounds, and the shrubs. The lawn 
was closely trimmed, and bord- 
ered by a low spike-topped black- 
iron fence. 

Jim pulled in to the curb in 
front of the house, got out, opened 
a low wrought-iron gate in the 
fence, and started up the walk. He 
glanced up at the trees, saw noth- 
ing of floodlights, then looked at 
the house. 

The house had a gracious, neat, 
well-groomed appearance. All the 
window-panes shone, all the shades 
were even, all the curtains neatly 
hung, all the trim’ bright and the 
shutters straight. Jim, close to the 
house, raised his eyes to the tower. 



All the shutters there were perfect 
and even and straight. 

The sense of wrongness that had 
bothered him the day before was 
back again. He paused in his stride, 
frowning. 

The front door opened and a 
plump, gray-haired woman in a 
light-blue maid’s uniform stood in 
the doorway. With her left hand, 
she smoothed her white apron. 

“My,” she said, smiling, “isn’t it 
a nice day?” She stepped back and 
with her left hand opened the door 
wider. “Come in.” Her right hand 
remained at her side, half-hidden 
by the ruffles of her apron. 

Jim’s mouth felt dry. “May I,” 
he said, “speak to Miss Cynthia?” 

“Of course you may,” said the 
woman. She shut the door behind 
him. 

They were in a small vestibule 
opening into a high-ceilinged hall- 
way. Down the hall, Jim could see 
an open staircase to the second 
floor, and several wide doorways 
with heavy dark draperies. 

“Go straight ahead and up the 
stairs,” said the woman in a pleas- 
ant voice. “Turn left at the head 
of the stairs. Miss Cynthia is in the 
second room on the right.” 

Jim took one step. There was a 
sudden sharp pressure on his skull, 
a flash of white light, and a piercing 
pain and a pressure in his right 
arm— a sensation like that of an 
injection. Then there was nothing 
but blackness.

RADUALLY he became 
aware that he was lying on 
a bed, with a single cover over 
him. He opened his eyes to see 
that he was in an airy room with a 
light drapery blowing in at the 
window. He started to sit up and 
his head throbbed. The walls of 
the room leaned out and came 
back. For an instant, he saw the 
room like a photographic negative, 
the white woodwork black and the 
dark furniture nearly white. He 
lay carefully back on the pillow 
and the room returned to normal. 

He heard the quick tap of high 
heels in the hallway and a door 
opened beside him. He turned his 
head. The room seemed to spin in 
circles around him. He shut his 
eyes. 

When he opened his eyes again, 
a tall, dark-haired woman was 
watching him with a faint hint of 
a smile. “How do you feel?” 

“Not good,” said Jim. 

“It’s too bad we have to do it 
this way, but some people lose 
their nerve. Others come with the 
thought that we have a profitable 
business and they would like to 
have a part of it. We have to bring 
these people around to our way of 
thinking.” 

“What’s your way of thinking?” 

She looked at him seriously. 
“What we have to offer is worth 
far more than any ordinary pattern 
of life. We can’t let it fall into the 
wrong hands.” 



“What is it that you have to 
offer?” 

She smiled again. “I can’t tell 
you as well as you can experience 
it.” 

“That may be. But a man going 
into a strange country likes to have 
a road map.” 

“That’s very nicely put,” she 
said, “but you won’t be going into 
any strange country. What we of- 
fer you is nothing but your reason- 
able desires in life.” 

“Is that all?” 

“It’s enough.” 

“Is there any danger of addic- 
tion?” 

“After you taste steak, is there 
any danger of your wanting more? 
After you hold perfect beauty in 
your arms, is there any danger 
you might want to do so again? 
The superior is always addicting.” 
He looked at her for a moment. 
“And how about my affairs? Will 
they suffer?” 

“That depends on you.” 

“What if I go from here straight 
to the police station?” 

“You won’t. Once we are be- 
trayed, you can never come back. 
We won’t be here. You wouldn’t 
want that.” 

“Do you give me anything to 
take out? Can I buy—” 

“No,” she said. “You can’t take 
anything out but your memories. 
You’ll find they will be enough.” 
As she said this, Jim had a clear 
mental picture of the girl sitting on 



MIND PARTNER

the cot in the hospital, staring at 
the floor. He felt a sudden intense 
desire to get out. He started to sit 
up, and the room darkened and 
spun around him. 

H E felt the woman’s cool hands 
ease him back into place. 
“Now,” she said, “do you have 
any more questions?” 

“No,” said Jim. 

“Then,” she said briskly, “we 
can get down to business. The 
charge for your first series of three 
visits is one thousand dollars per 
visit.” 

“What about the next visits?” 
“Must we discuss that now?” 
“I’d like to know.” 

“The charge for each succeeding 
series of three is doubled.” 

“How often do I come back?” 
“We don’t allow anyone to re- 
turn oftener than once every two 
weeks. That is for your own pro- 
tection.” 

Jim did a little mental arith- 
metic, and estimated that by the 
middle of the year a man would 
have to pay sixteen thousand dol- 
lars a visit, and by the end of the 
year it would be costing him a 
quarter of a million each time he 
came to the place. 

“Why,” he asked, “does the cost 
increase?” 

“Because, I’ve been told to tell 
those who ask, your body acquires 
a tolerance and we have to over- 
come it. If we have to use twice as 



much of the active ingredient in 
our treatment, it seems fair for us 
to charge twice as much.” 

“I see.” Jim cautiously eased 
himself up a little. “And suppose 
that I decide right now not to pay 
anything at all.” 

She shook her head impatiently. 
“You’re on a one-way street The 
only way you can go is forward.” 
“That remains to be seen.” 
“Then you’ll see.” 

She stepped to a dresser against 
the wall, picked up an atomizer, 
turned the little silver nozzle 
toward him, squeezed the white 
rubber bulb, and set the atomizer 
back on the dresser. She opened 
the door and went out. Jim felt a 
mist of fine droplets falling on his 
face. He tried to inhale very gently 
to see if it had an odor. His mus- 
cles wouldn’t respond. 

He lay very still for a moment 
and felt the droplets falling one by 
one. They seemed to explode and 
tingle as they touched his skin. He 
lay still a moment more, braced 
himself to make one lunge out of 
the bed, then tried it. 

He lay flat on his back on the 
bed. A droplet tingled and ex- 
ploded on his cheek. 

He was beginning to feel a 
strong need for breath. 

He braced himself once more, 
simply to move sidewise off the 
pillow. Once there, he could get 
further aside in stages, out of the 
range of the droplets. He kept 



16

thinking, “Just a moment now — 
steady — just a moment — just — 
Now!” 

And nothing happened. 

He lay flat on his back on the 
bed. A droplet tingled and ex- 
ploded on his cheek. 

The need for air was becoming 
unbearable. 

J IM’S head was throbbing and 
the room went dark with many 
tiny spots of light. He tried to 
suck in air and he couldn’t. He 
tried to breathe out, but his chest 
and lungs didn’t move. He could 
hear the pound of his heart grow- 
ing fast and loud. 

He couldn’t move. 

At the window, the light drapery 
fluttered and blew in and fell back. 

He lay flat on the bed and felt 
a droplet tingle and explode on 
his cheek. 

His skull was throbbing. His 
heart writhed and hammered in 
his chest. The room was going 
dark. 

Then something gave way and 
his lungs were dragging in painful 
gasps of fresh air. He sobbed like 
a runner at the end of a race. After 
a long time, a feeling of peace and 
tiredness came over him. 

The door opened. 

He looked up. The woman was 
watching him sadly. “I’m sorry,” 
she said. “Do you want to discuss 
payment?” 

Jim nodded. 



The woman sat down in a chair 
by the bed. “As I’ve explained, the 
initial series of three visits cost one 
thousand dollars each. We will ac- 
cept a personal check or even an 
I. O. U. for the first payment. After 
that, you must have cash.” 

Jim made out a check for one 
thousand dollars. 

The woman nodded, smiled, 
and folded the check into a small 
purse. She went out, came back 
with a glass of colorless liquid, 
shook a white powder into it, and 
handed it to him. 

“Drink it all,” she said. “A little 
bit can be excruciatingly painful.” 

Jim hesitated. He sat up a little 
and began to feel dizzy. He de- 
cided he had better do as she said, 
took the glass and drained it. It 
tasted exactly like sodium bicar- 
bonate dissolved in water. He 
handed her the glass and she went 
to the door. 

“The first experiences,” she said, 
“are likely to be a little exuberant. 
Remember, your time sense will 
be distorted, as it is in a dream.” 
She went out and shut the door 
softly. 

Jim fervently wished he were 
somewhere else. He wondered 
what she had meant by the last 
comment. The thought came to 
him that if he could get out of this 
place, he could give Walters and 
the doctors a chance to see the 
drug in action. 

He got up, and had the momen- 



M I ND PARTNER 



17

tary sensation of doing two things 
at once. He seemed to lie motion- 
less on the bed and to stand up at 
one and the same time. He won- 
dered if the drug could have taken 
effect already. He lay down and 
got up again. This time he felt 
only a little dizzy. He went to the 
window and looked out. He was 
in a second-story window, and the 
first-floor rooms in this house had 
high ceilings. Moreover, he now 
discovered he was wearing a sort 
of hospital gown. He couldn’t go 
into the street in that without caus- 
ing a sensation, and he didn’t know 
just when the drug would take 
effect. 

H E heard the soft click of the 
door opening and turned 
around. The woman who had 
talked to him came in and closed 
the door gently behind her. Jim 
watched in a daze as she turned 
languorously, and it occurred to 
him that no woman he had ever 
seen had moved quite like that, so 
the chances were that the drug 
had taken effect and he was imag- 
ining all this. He remembered that 
she had said the first experiences 
were likely to be a little exuberant, 
and his time sense distorted as in 
a dream. 

Jim spent the night, if it was the 
night, uncertain as to what was 
real and what was due to the drug. 
But it was all vivid, and realistic 
events shaded into adventures he 



knew were imaginary, but that 
were so bright and satisfying that 
he didn’t care if they were real or 
not. In these adventures, the colors 
were pure colors, and the sounds 
were clear sounds, and nothing was 
muddied or uncertain as in life. 

It was so vivid and clear that 
when he found himself lying on 
the bed with the morning sun 
streaming in, he was astonished 
that he could remember not a 
single incident save the first, and 
that one not clearly. 

He got up and found his clothes 
lying on a chair by the bed. He 
dressed rapidly, glanced around 
for the little atomizer and saw it 
was gone. He stepped out into the 
hall and there was a sudden sharp 
pressure on his skull, a flash of 
white light, and a feeling of limp- 
ness. He felt strong hands grip and 
carry him. He felt himself hurried 
down a flight of steps, along a cor- 
ridor, then set down with his back 
against a wall. 

When he felt strong enough to, 
he opened his eyes. 

The plump, gray-haired woman 
took a damp cloth and held it to 
his head. “You’ll be all over that 
in a little while,” she said. “I don’t 
see why they have to do that.” 

“Neither do I,” said Jim. He felt 
reasonably certain that she had 
done the same thing to him when 
he came in. He looked around, saw 
that they were in a small bare 
entry, and got cautiously to his

feet. “Is my car still out front?” 
“No,” she said. “It’s parked in 
back, in the drive.” 

“Thank you,” he said. “Say 
good-by to Miss Cynthia for me.” 
The woman smiled. “You’ll be 
back.” 

He was very much relieved to 
get outside the house. He walked 
back along the wide graveled 
drive, found his car, got in, and 
started it. When he reached the 
front of the house, he slowed the 
car to glance back. To his surprise, 
the two shutters on the third floor 
of the tower had broken slats. He 
thought this had some significance, 
but he was unable to remember 
what it was. He sat for a moment, 
puzzled, then decided that the im- 
portant thing was to get to Walters. 
He swung the car out into the early 
morning traffic, and settled back 
with a feeling compounded of nine 
parts relief and one part puzzle- 
ment. 

What puzzled him was that any- 
one should pay one thousand dol- 
lars for a second dose of that. 

'T'HE doctors made a lightning 
examination, announced that 
he seemed physically sound, and 
then Walters questioned him. He 
described the experience in close 
detail, and Walters listened, nod- 
ding from time to time. At the end, 
Jim said, “I’ll be damned if I can 
see why anyone should go back!” 
“That is puzzling,” said Walters. 



“It may be that they were all sen- 
sation-seekers, though that’s a little 
odd, too. Whatever the reason, it’s 
lucky you weren’t affected.” 

“Maybe I’d better keep my 
fingers crossed,” said Jim. 

Walters laughed. “I’ll bring your 
bankbook in to keep you happy.” 
He went out, and a moment later 
the doctors were in again. It wasn’t 
until the next morning that they 
were willing to let him go. Just as 
he was about to leave, one of them 
remarked to him, “I hope you 
never need a blood transfusion in 
a hurry.” 

“Why so?” Jim asked. 

“You have one of the rarest 
combinations I’ve ever seen.” He 
held out an envelope. “Walters 
said to give you this.” 

Jim opened it. It was a duplicate 
deposit slip for a sum as high as 
five figures could go. 

Jim went out to a day that wasn’t 
sunny, but looked just as good to 
him as if it had been. 

After careful thought, Jim de- 
cided to use the money to open a 
detective agency of his own. Wal- 
ters, who caught the dope gang 
trying to escape through an unused 
steam tunnel, gave Jim his bless- 
ing, and the offer of a job if things 
went wrong. 

Fortunately, things went very 
well. Jim’s agency prospered. In 
time, he found the right girl, they 
married, and had two boys and a 
girl. The older boy became a doc- 



20 



GALAXY 



tor, and the girl married a likable 
fast-rising young lawyer. The 
younger boy had a series of un- 
pleasant scrapes and seemed bound 
on wrecking his life. Jim, who was 
by this time very well to do, at last 
offered the boy a job in his agency, 
and was astonished to see him 
take hold. 

The years fled past much faster 
than Jim would have liked. Still, 
when the end came near, he had 
the pleasure of knowing that his 
life’s work would be in the capable 
hands of his own son. 

He breathed his last breath in 
satisfaction. 

And woke up lying on a bed in a 
room where a light drapery blew 
back at the window and the morn- 
ing sun shone in, and his clothes 
were folded on a chair by his bed. 

J IM sat up very carefully. He 
held his hand in front of his 
face and turned it over slowly. It 
was not the hand of an old man. 
He got up and looked in a mirror, 
then sat down on the edge of the 
bed. He was young, all right. The 
question was, was this an old man’s 
nightmare, or was the happy life 
he had just lived a dope addict’s 
dream? 

He remembered the woman who 
had doped him saying, “What we 
offer you is nothing but your reas- 
onable desires in life.” 

Then it had all been a dream. 
But a dream should go away, 



and this remained clear in his 
memory. 

He dressed, went out in the hall, 
felt a sudden pressure on his skull, 
a flash of white light, and a feeling 
of limpness. 

He came to in the small entry, 
and the plump, gray-haired woman 
carefully held a damp cool cloth 
to his head. 

“Thanks,” he said. “Is my car 
out back?” 

“Yes,” she said, and he went out. 

As he drove away from the 
house he glanced back and noticed 
the two broken shutters on the 
third floor of the tower. The mem- 
ory of his dream about this same 
event — leaving the place — jarred 
him. It seemed that those broken 
shutters meant something, but he 
was unable to remember what. He 
trod viciously on the gas pedal, 
throwing a spray of gravel on the 
carefully tailored lawn as he swung 
into the street. 

He still did not see why anyone 
should go back there with anything 
less than a shotgun. 

He told Walters the whole story, 
including the details of his “life,” 
that he remembered so clearly. 

“You’ll get over it,” Walters fi- 
nally said, when Jim was ready to 
leave the hospital. “It’s a devil of 
a thing to have happen, but there’s 
an achievement in it you can be 
proud of.” 

“You name it,” said Jim bitterly. 

“You’ve saved a lot of other 



MIND PARTNER 



21 



people from this same thing. The 
doctors have analyzed the traces 
of drug still in your blood. They 
think they can neutralize it. Then 
we are going to put a few sturdy 
men inside that house, and while 
they’re assumed to be under the 
influence, we’ll raid the place.” 

The tactic worked, but Jim 
watched the trial with a cynical 
eye. He couldn’t convince himself 
that it was true. He might, for all 
he knew, be lying in a second-floor 
room of the house on a bed, while 
these people, who seemed to be on 
trial, actually were going freely 
about their business. 

This inability to accept what he 
saw as real at last forced Jim to 
resign his job. Using the generous 
bonus Walters had given him, he 
took up painting. As he told Wal- 
ters on one of his rare visits, “It 
may or may not be that what I’m 
doing is real, but at least there’s 
the satisfaction of the work itself.” 
“You’re not losing any money 
on it,” said Walters shrewdly. 

“I know,” said Jim, “and that 
makes me acutely uneasy.” 

On his 82nd birthday, Jim was 
widely regarded as the “Grand Old 
Man” of painting. His hands and 
feet felt cold that day, and he fell 
into an uneasy, shallow-breathing 
doze. He woke with a start and a 
choking cough. For an instant 
everything around him had an un- 
natural clarity; then it all went 
dark and he felt himself falling. 



He awoke in a bed in a room 
where a light drapery fluttered at 
the window, and the morning sun 
shone into the room. 

T HIS time, Jim entertained no 
doubts as to whether or not 
this was real. He got up angrily 
and smashed his fist into the wall 
with all his might. 

The shock and pain jolted him 
to his heels. 

He went out the same way as 
before, but he had to drive one- 
handed, gritting his teeth all the 
way. 

The worst of it was that the doc- 
tors weren’t able to make that 
hand exactly right afterward. Even 
if the last “life” had been a dream 
—even if this one was— he wanted 
to paint. But every time he tried 
to, he felt so clumsy that he gave 
up in despair. 

Walters, dissatisfied, gave Jim 
the minimum possible payment. 
The gang escaped. Jim eventually 
lost his job, and in the end he eked 
out his life at poorly paid odd jobs. 

The only consolation he felt was 
that his life was so miserable that 
it must be true.- 

He went to bed sick one night 
and woke up the next morning on 
a bed in a room where a light 
drapery fluttered at the window 
and the early morning sun shone 
brightly in. 

This happened to him twice 
more. 



22 



GALAXY 



The next time after that, he lay 
still on the bed and stared at the 
ceiling. The incidents and details 
of five lives danced in his mind like 
jabbering monkeys. He pressed his 
palms to his forehead and wished 
he could forget it all. 

The door opened softly and the 
tall, dark-haired woman was watch- 
ing him with a faint smile. “I told 
you,” she said, “that you couldn’t 
take anything away but memories.” 

He looked up at her sickly. 
“That seems like a long, long while 
ago.” 

She nodded and sat down. “Your 
time sense is distorted as in a 
dream.” 

“I wish,” he said drearily, look- 
ing at her, “that I could just forget 
it all. I don’t see why anyone 
would come back for more of 
that.” 

She leaned forward to grip the 
edge of the mattress, shaking 
with laughter. She sat up again. 
“Whew!” she said, looking at him 
and forcing her face to be straight. 
“Nobody comes back for more. 
That is the unique quality of this 
drug. People come back to forget 
they ever had it.” 

He sat up. “I can forget that?” 

“Oh, yes. Don’t get so excited! 
That’s what you really paid your 
thousand dollars for. The forget- 
fulness drug lingers in your blood- 
stream for two to three weeks. 
Then memory returns and you’re 
due for another visit.” 



Jim looked at her narrowly. 
“Does my body become tolerant 
of this drug? Does it take twice as 
much after three visits, four times 
as much after six visits, eight 
times as much after nine visits?” 
“No.” 

“Then you lied to me.” 

S HE looked at him oddly. “What 
would you have expected of 
me? But I didn’t lie to you. I mere- 
ly said that that was what I was 
told to tell those who asked.” 
“Then what’s the point of it?” 
Jim asked. 

“What’s the point of bank rob- 
bery?” She frowned at him. “You 
ask a lot of questions. Aren’t you 
lucky I know the answers? Ordi- 
narily you wouldn’t get around to 
this till you’d stewed for a few 
weeks. But you seem precocious, 
so I’ll tell you.” 

“That’s nice,” he said. 

“The main reason for the im- 
possible rates is so you can’t pay 
off in money.” 

“How does that help you?” 
“Because,” she said, “every time 
you bring us a new patron, you get 
three free visits yourself.” 

“Ah,” he said. 

“It needn’t be so terribly un- 
pleasant, coming here.” 

“What happens if, despite every- 
thing, some sorehead actually goes 
and tells the police about this?” 
“We move.” 

“Suppose they catch you?” 



MIND PARTNER

“They won’t. Or, at least, it isn’t 
likely.” 

“But you’ll leave?” 

“Yes.” 

“What happens to me?” 

“Don’t you see? We’ll have to 
leave. Someone will have betrayed 
us. We couldn’t stay because it 
might happen again. It isn’t right 
from your viewpoint, but we can’t 
take chances.” 

For a few moments they didn’t 
talk, and the details of Jim’s pre- 
vious “lives” came pouring in on 
him. He sat up suddenly. “Where’s 
that forgetfulness drug?” 

She went outside and came back 
with a glass of colorless liquid. 
She poured in a faintly pink 
powder and handed it to him. He 
drank it quickly and it tasted like 
bicarbonate of soda dissolved in 
water. 

He looked at her. “This isn’t 
the same thing all over again, is 
it?” 

“Don’t worry,” she said. “You’ll 
forget.” 

The room began to go dark. He 
leaned back. The last thing he was 
conscious of was her cool hand on 
his forehead, then the faint click 
as she opened the door to go out. 

He sat up. He dressed, drove 
quickly to Walters and told him 
all he could remember. Walters 
immediately organized his raid. 
Jim saw the place closed up with 
no one caught 

After two weeks and four days, 



the memories flooded back. His 
life turned into a nightmare. At 
every turn, the loves, hates, and 
tiny details of six separate lives 
poured in on him. He tried drugs 
in an attempt to forget, and sank 
from misery to hopeless despair. 
He ended up in a shooting scrap as 
Public Enemy Number Four. 

And then he awoke and found 
himself in a bed in a room with a 
light drapery blowing in at the 
window, and the early morning sun 
shining brightly in. 

“Merciful God!” he said. 

The door clicked shut. 

J IM sprang to the door and 
looked out in the carpeted hall. 
There was the flash of a woman’s 
skirt; then a tall narrow door down 
the hallway closed to shut off his 
view. 

He drew back into the room and 
shut the door. The house was quiet. 
In the distance, on the street, he 
could hear the faint sound of a 
passing car. 

He swallowed hard. He glanced 
at the window. It had been, he rea- 
soned, early morning when he had 
talked to the woman last. It was 
early morning now. He recalled 
that before she went out she said, 
“You’ll forget.” He had then lived 
his la.st miserable “life”— and awak- 
ened to hear the click as the door 
came shut behind her. 

That had all taken less than five 
seconds of actual time.

GALAXY 



He found his clothes on a near- 
by chair and started to dress. As he 
did so, he realized for the first time 
that the memories of his “lives” 
were no longer clear to him. They 
were fading away, almost as the 
memories of a dream do after a 
man wakes and gets up. Almost as 
the memories of a dream, but not 
quite. Jim found that if he thought 
of them, they gradually became 
clear again. 

He tried to forget and turned his 
attention to the tree he could see 
through the window. He looked at 
the curve of its boughs, and at a 
black-and-yellow bird balancing on 
a branch in the breeze. 

The memories faded away, and 
he began to plan what to do. No 
sooner did he do this than he re- 
membered with a shock that he 
had said to Walters, “If I don’t 
come out next morning, I want you 
to come in after me.” 

And Walters had said, “We will.” 

So that must have been just last 
night. 

Jim finished dressing, took a 
deep breath, and held out his hand. 
It looked steady. He opened the 
door, stepped out into the hall, and 
an instant too late remembered 
what had happened six times be- 
fore. 

When he opened his eyes, the 
plump, gray-haired woman was 
holding a damp cloth to his fore- 
head and clucking sympathetical- 
ly. 



Jim got carefully to his feet, and 
walked down the drive to his car. 
He slid into the driver’s seat, 
started the engine, and sat still a 
moment, thinking. Then he released 
the parking brake, and pressed 
lightly on the gas pedal. The car 
slid smoothly ahead, the gravel of 
the drive crunching under its tires. 
He glanced up as the car reached 
the end of the drive, and looked 
back at the tower. Every slat in the 
shutters was perfect. Jim frowned, 
trying to remember something. 
Then he glanced up and down the 
street, and swung out into the light 
early morning traffic. 

He wasted no time getting to 
Walters. 

"tFE was greeted with an all-en- 
compassing inspection that 
traveled from Jim’s head to his 
feet. Walters looked tense. He took 
a cigar from a box on his desk and 
put it in his mouth unlit. 

“I’ve spent half the night telling 
myself there are some things you 
can’t ask a man to do for money. 
But we had to do it. Are you all 
right?” 

“At the moment.” 

“There are doctors and medical 
technicians in the next room. Do 
you want to see them now or 
later?” 

“Right now.” 

In the next hour, Jim took off 
his clothes, stood up, lay down, 
looked into bright lights, winced as

a sharp hollow needle was forced 
into his arm, gave up samples of 
bodily excretions, sat back as elec- 
trodes were strapped to his skin, 
and at last was reassured that he 
would be all right. He dressed, and 
found himself back in Walters’ of- 
fice. 

Walters looked at him sympa- 
thetically. 

“How do you feel?” 

“Starved.” 

“I’ll have breakfast sent in.” He 
snapped on his intercom, gave the 
order, then leaned back. He picked 
up his still unlit cigar, lit it, puffed 
hard, and said, “What happened?” 

Jim told him, starting with the 
evening before, and ending when he 
swung his car out into traffic this 
morning. 

Walters listened with a gather- 
ing frown, drawing occasionally on 
the cigar. 

A breakfast of scrambled eggs 
and Canadian bacon was brought 
in. Walters got up, and looked out 
the window, staring down absently 
at the traffic moving past in the 
street below. Jim ate with single- 
minded concentration, and finally 
pushed his plate back and looked 
up. 

Walters ground his cigar butt 
in the ashtray and lit a fresh cigar. 
“This is a serious business. You 
say you remembered the details of 
each of those six lives clearly ?” 

“Worse than that. I remembered 
the emotions and the attachments. 



In the first life, for instance, I had 
my own business.” Jim paused and 
thought back. The memories grad- 
ually became clear again. “One of 
my men, for instance, was named 
Hart. He stood about five-seven, 
slender, with black hair, cut short 
when I first met him. Hart was a 
born actor. He could play any part. 
It wasn’t his face. His expression 
hardly seemed to change. But his 
manner changed. He could stride 
into a hotel and the bellboys would 
jump for his bags and the desk 
clerk spring to attention. He stood 
out. He was important. Or he could 
slouch in the front door, hesitate, 
look around, blink, start to ask one 
of the bellboys something, lose his 
nerve, stiffen his shoulders, sham- 
ble over to the desk, and get un- 
mercifully snubbed. Obviously, he 
was less than nobody. Or, again, he 
could quietly come in the front 
door, stroll across the lobby, fade 
out of sight somewhere, and hard- 
ly a person would notice or remem- 
ber him. Whatever part he played, 
he lived it. That was what made 
him so valuable.” 

V| {J ALTERS had taken the cigar 
out of his mouth, and listened 
intently. “You mean this Hart — 
this imaginary man — is real to 
you? In three dimensions?” 

“That’s it. Not only that, I like 
him. There were other, stronger at- 
tachments. I had a family.” 
“Which seems real?”

Jim nodded. “I realize as I say 
these things that I sound like a 
lunatic.” 

“No.” Walters shook his head 
sympathetically. “It all begins to 
make sense. Now I see why the girl 
at the hospital said to the doctor, 
‘You aren’t real.’ Does it hurt to 
talk about these ‘lives’?” 

Jim hesitated. “Not as long as 
we keep away from the personal 
details. But it hurt like nothing I 
can describe to have all six of these 
sets of memories running around 
in my head at once.” 

“I can imagine. All right, let’s 
track down some of these memo- 
ries and see how far the details go.” 
Jim nodded. “Okay.” 

Walters got out a bound note- 
book and pen. “We’ll start with 
your business. What firm name did 
you use?” 

“Calder Associates.” 

‘Why?” 

“It sounded dignified, looked 
good on a business card or letter- 
head, and wasn’t specific.” 

“What was your address?” 
“Four North Street. Earlier, it 
was 126 Main.” 

“How many men did you have 
working with you?” 

“To begin with, just Hart, and 
another man by the name of Dean. 
At the end, there were twenty- 
seven.” 

“What were their names?” 

Jim called them off one by one, 
without hesitation. 



Walters blinked. “Say that over 
again a little more slowly.” 

Jim repeated the list. 

“All right,” said Walters. “De- 
scribe these men.” 

Jim described them. He gave 
more and more details as Walters 
pressed for them, and by lunch 
time, Walters had a large section 
of the notebook filled. 

The two men ate, and Walters 
spent the rest of the afternoon 
quizzing Jim on his first “life.” 
Then they had steak and French 
fries sent up to the office. Walters 
ate in silence for a moment, then 
said, “Do you realize that you 
haven’t stumbled once?” 

J IM looked up in surprise. ‘What 
do you mean?” 

Walters said, “Quiz me on the 
names of every man who ever 
worked for me. I won’t remember 
all of them. Not by a long shot. You 
remember every last detail of this 
dream life with a total recall that 
beats anything I’ve ever seen.” 
“That’s the trouble. That’s why 
it’s pleasant to forget.” 

Walters asked suddenly, “Did 
you ever paint? Actually, I mean. 
I ask because you say you were an 
outstanding painter in one of these 
‘lives.’ ” 

‘When I was a boy, I painted 
some. I wanted to be an artist.” 
“Can you come out to my place 
tonight? I’d like to see whether you 
can really handle the brushes.” 



MIND PARTNER

Jim nodded. “Yes, I’d like to try 
that.” 

They drove out together, and 
Walters got out a dusty paint set 
in a wooden case, set up a folding 
easel, and put a large canvas on it. 

Jim stood still a moment, think- 
ing back. Then he began to paint. 
He lost himself in the work, as he 
always had, all through the years, 
and what he was painting now he 
had painted before. Had painted 
it, and sold it for a good price, too. 
And it was worth it. He could still 
see the model in his mind as he 
painted with swift precise strokes. 

He stepped back. 

“My Lady in Blue” was a cheer- 
ful girl of seventeen. She smiled 
out from the canvas as if at any 
moment she might laugh or wave. 

Jim glanced around. For an in- 
stant the room seemed strange. 
Then he remembered where he 
was. 

Walters looked at the painting 
for a long moment, then looked at 
Jim, and swallowed. He carefully 
took the painting from the easel 
and replaced it with another blank 
canvas. He went across the room 
and got a large floor-type ashtray, 
a wrought-iron affair with a gallop- 
ing horse for the handle. 

“Paint this.” 

Jim looked at it. He stepped up 
to the canvas, hesitated. He raised 
the brush — and stopped. He didn’t 
know where to begin. He frowned 
and carefully thought back to his 



first lessons. “Let’s see.” He glanced 
up. “Do you have any tracing 
paper?” 

“Just a minute,” said Walters. 
Jim tacked the paper over the 
canvas and methodically drew the 
ashtray on the paper. He had a 
hard time, but at last looked at 
the paper triumphantly. “Now, do 
you have any transfer paper?” 
Walters frowned. “I’ve got car- 
bon paper.” 

“All right.” 

Walters got it. Jim put a sheet 
under his tracing paper, tacked it 
up again, and carefully went over 
the drawing with a pencil. He un- 
tacked the paper, then methodi- 
cally began to paint. At length, 
weary and perspiring, he stepped 
back. 

Walter looked at it. Jim blinked 
and looked again. Walters said, “A 
trifle off-center, isn’t it?” 

There was no doubt about it, the 
ashtray stood too far toward the 
upper right-hand corner of the 
canvas. 

Walters pointed at the other 
painting. “Over there we have a 
masterpiece that you dashed off 
freehand. Here we have, so to 
speak, a piece of good, sound 
mechanical drawing that isn’t prop- 
erly placed on the canvas. This 
took you longer to do than the 
other. How come?” 

“I had done the other before.” 
“And you remember the mo- 
tions of your hand? Is that it?” He 



28 



GALAXY 



put another canvas up. “Do it 
again.” 

Jim frowned. He stepped for- 
ward, thought a moment, and be- 
gan to paint. He lost himself in a 
perfection of concentration. In 
time, he stepped back. 

Walters looked at it. He swal- 
lowed hard, glanced back and forth 
from this painting to the one Jim 
had done at first. He lifted the 
painting carefully from the easel 
and placed it beside the other. 

They looked identical. 

r T'HE sun was just lighting the 
horizon as they drove back to 
the office. Walters said, “I’m going 
in there and sleep on the cot. Can 
you get back around three this 
afternoon?” 

“Sure.” 

Jim drove home, slept, ate, and 
was back again by three. 

“This is a devil of a puzzle,” said 
Walters, leaning back at his desk 
and blowing out a cloud of smoke. 
“I’ve had half a dozen experts 
squint at one of those paintings. 
I’ve been offered five thousand, 
even though they don’t know the 
artist’s name. Then I showed them 
the other painting and they almost 
fell through the floor. It isn’t pos- 
sible, but each stroke appears iden- 
tical. How do you feel?” 

“Better. And I’ve remembered 
something. Let’s look at your 
model.” 

They went to the big model of 



the mansion, and Jim touched the 
upper story of the tower. “Have 
some of the boys sketch this. Then 
compare the sketches with photo- 
graphs.” 

Soon they were looking at 
sketches and photographs side by 
side. The sketches showed the 
tower shutters perfect. The photo- 
graphs showed several slats of the 
shutters broken. 

Walters questioned the men, 
who insisted the shutters were per- 
fect. After they left, Jim said, 
“Everyone who sketched that place 
wasn’t drugged. And the cameras 
certainly weren’t drugged.” 

Walters said, “Let’s take a look.” 
They drove out past the mansion, 
and the shutters looked perfect. A 
new photograph showed the same 
broken slats. 

Back at the office, Walters said, 
“Just what are we up against here?” 
Jim said, “I can think of two 
possibilities.” 

“Let’s hear them.” 

“Often you can do the same 
thing several different ways. A 
man, for instance, can go from one 
coastal town to another on foot, 
riding a horse, by car, by plane, or 
in a speedboat.” 

“Granted.” 

“A hundred years ago, the list 
would have been shorter.” 

Walter nodded thoughtfully. “I 
follow you. Go on.” 

“Whoever sees those shutters as 
perfect is, for the time being, in an

abnormal mental state. How did 
he get there? We’ve assumed 
drugs were used. But just as there 
are new ways of going from one 
city to another, so there may be 
new ways of passing from one men- 
tal state to another. Take subli- 
minal advertising, for instance, 
where the words, ‘THIRSTY,’ 
‘THIRSTY,’ ‘BEER,’ may be 
flashed on the screen too fast to be 
consciously seen.” 

“It’s illegal.” 

“Suppose someone found out 
how to do it undetected, and de- 
cided to try it out on a small scale. 
What about nearly imperceptible 
verbal clues instead of visual 
ones?” 

ALTERS’ eyes narrowed. 
“We’ll analyze every sound 
coming out of that place and check 
for any kind of suspicious sensory 
stimulus whatever. What’s your 
other idea?” 

“Well, go back to your travel 
analogy. Going from one place to 
another, any number of animals 
can outrun, outfly, and outswim a 
man. Let Man work on the prob- 
lem long enough, and roll up to the 
starting line in his rocket-plane, 
and the result will be different. But 
until Man has time to concentrate 
enough thought and effort, the non- 
human creature has an excellent 
chance to beat him. There are bet- 
ter fliers, better swimmers, better 
fighters, better — ” 



Walters frowned. “Better sug- 
gestionists? Like the snake that’s 
said to weave hypnotically?” 

“Yes, and the wasp that stings 
the trapdoor spider, when other 
wasps are fought off.” 

“Hmm. Maybe. But I incline to 
the subliminal advertising theory 
myself.” He looked at the mansion. 
“Where would they keep the 
device?” 

“Why not the tower?” 

Walters nodded. “It’s an easy 
place to guard, and to shut off from 
visitors.” 

Jim said, “It might explain those 
shutters. They might not care to 
risk painters and repairmen up 
there.” 

Walters knocked the ash off his 
cigar. “But how do we get in there 
to find out?” 

They studied the model. Wal- 
ters, “Say we send in a ‘building 
inspector.’ They’ll merely knock 
him out, hallucinate a complete 
series of incidents in his mind, and 
send him out totally ignorant. If 
we try to raid the place in a group, 
they’ll vanish with the help of that 
machine. But there must be some 
way.” 

Jim said thoughtfully, “Those 
trees overhang the room.” 

“They do, don’t they?” 

The two men studied the trees 
and the tower. 

Jim touched one of the arching 
limbs. “What if we lowered a rope 
from here?” 



30 



GALAXY 



Walters tied an eraser on a 
string and fastened the string to a 
limb. The eraser hung by the up- 
permost tower winder. Walters 
scowled, snapped on the intercom, 
and asked for several of his men. 
Then he turned to Jim. “We’ll see 
what Cullen thinks. He’s done 
some jobs like this.” 

Cullen had sharp eyes and a mo- 
bile face that grew unhappy as he 
listened to Walters. Finally, he 
shook his head. “No, thanks. Ask me 
to go up a wall, or the side of a 
building. But not down out of a 
tree branch on the end of a rope.” 

He gave the eraser a little flip 
with his finger. It swung in circles, 
hit the wall, and bounced away. 

“Say I’m actually up there. It’s 
night. The rope swings. The limb 
bobs up and down. The tree sways. 
All to a different rhythm. I’m spin- 
ning around on the end of this rope. 
One second this shutter is one side 
of me. The next second it’s on the 
other side and five feet away. A job 
is a job, but this is one I don’t 
want.” 

Walters turned to Jim after 
Cullen went out. “That settles 
that.” 

Jim looked at the tree limb. 
Two or three weeks from today, 
he told himself, the memories 
would come flooding back. The 
people who had done it would get 
away, and do it again. And he 
would have those memories. 

Jim glanced at Walters stub- 



bornly. “I am going to climb that 
tree.” 

r 1 1 HE night was still, with a dark 
overcast sky as Jim felt the 
rough bark against the insides of 
his arms. He hitched up the belt 
that circled the tree, then pulled 
up one foot, then another as he 
sank the climbing irons in higher 
up. He could hear Cullen’s advice: 
“Practice, study the model, do each 
step over and over in your head. 
Then, when you’re actually doing 
it and when things get tight, hold 
your mind on what to do next. Do 
that. Then think of the next step.” 

Jim was doing this as the dark 
lawn dropped steadily away. He 
felt the tree trunk grow gradually 
more slender, then begin to widen. 
He worked his way carefully above 
the limb, refastened the belt, and 
felt a puff of warm air touch his 
face and neck, like a leftover from 
the warm day. Somewhere, a radio 
was playing. 

He climbed, aware now of the 
rustling around him of leaves. 

The trunk widened again, and 
he knew he was at the place where 
the trunk separated into the limbs 
that arched out to form the crown 
of the tree. 

He pulled himself up carefully, 
and took his eyes from the tree for 
a moment to look toward the man- 
sion. He saw the slanting tile roof 
of an entirely different house, light 
shining down from a dormer win-

dow. He glanced around, to see the 
looming steep-roofed tower of the 
mansion in the opposite direction. 
He realized he must have partially 
circled the tree and lost his sense 
of direction. 

He swallowed and crouched in 
the cleft between the limbs till he 
was sure he knew which limb 
arched over the tower. He fastened 
the belt and started slowly up. 



As he climbed, the limb arched, 
to become more and more nearly 
horizontal. At the same time, the 
limb became more slender. It be- 
gan to respond to his movements, 
swaying slightly as he climbed. 
Now he was balancing on it, the 
steep roof of the tower shining 
faintly ahead of him. He remem- 
bered that he had to take off the 
climbing irons, lest they foul in the

rope later on. As he twisted to do 
this, his hands trembled. He forced 
his breath to come steadily. He 
looked ahead to the steep, slant- 
ing roof of the tower. 

The limb was already almost 
level. If he crawled further, it 
would sag under him. He would be 
climbing head down. He glanced 
back, and his heart began to pound. 
To go back, he would have to inch 



backwards along the narrow limb. 

Cullen’s words came to him: 
“When things get tight, hold your 
mind on what to do next. Do that. 
Then think of the next step.” 

TT E inched ahead. The limb be- 
gan to sag. 

There was a rustling of leaves. 
The limb swayed. It fell, and 
rose, beneath him. 



MIND PARTNER 



33 



He clung to it, breathing hard. 

He inched further. The leaves 
rustled. The limb pressed up, then 
fell away. He shut his eyes, his fore- 
head tight against the bark, and 
crept ahead. After a time, he 
seemed to feel himself tip to one 
side. His eyes opened. 

The tower was almost beneath 
him. 

With his left arm, he clung 
tightly to the limb. With his right, 
he felt carefully for the rope tied 
to his belt. He worked one end of 
the rope forward and carefully 
looped it around the limb. He tied 
the knot that he had practiced over 
and over, then tested it, and felt 
it hold. 

A breeze stirred the leaves. The 
limb began to sway. 

The dark lawn below seemed to 
reach up and he felt himself al- 
ready falling. He clung hard to the 
limb and felt his body tremble all 
over. Then he knew he had to go 
through the rest of his plan without 
hesitation, lest he lose his nerve 
completely. 

He sucked in a deep breath, 
swung over the limb, let go with 
one hand, caught the rope, then 
caught it with the other hand, 
looped the rope around one ankle, 
and started to slide down. 

The rope swung. The limb 
dipped, then lifted. The tree 
seemed to sway slightly. 

Jim clung, his left foot clamping 
the loop of the rope passed over 



his right ankle. The swaying, dip- 
ping, and whirling began to die 
down. His hands felt weak and 
tired. 

He slid gradually down the rope. 
Then the shutter was right beside 
him. He reached out, put his hand 
through the break in the slats, and 
lifted the iron catch. The hinges 
of the shutters screeched as he 
pulled them open. 

A dead black oblong hung be- 
fore him. 

He reached out, and felt no sash 
in the opening. He climbed higher 
on the rope, pushed away from the 
building, and as he swung back, 
stepped across, caught the frame, 
and dropped inside. 

The shutters screeched as he 
pulled them shut, but the house re- 
mained quiet. He stood still for a 
long moment, then unsnapped a 
case on his belt, and took out a 
little polarizing flashlight. He care- 
fully thumbed the stud that turned 
the front lens. A dim beam faintly 
lit the room. 

There was a glint of metal, then 
another. Shiny parallel lines ran 
from the ceiling to floor in front of 
him. There was an odd faint odor. 

The house was quiet. A shift of 
the wind brought the distant sound 
of recorded music. 

C AREFULLY, Jim eased the 
stud of the flashlight further 
around, so the light grew a trifle 
brighter. 



34 



GALAXY 



The vertical lines looked like 
bars. 

He stepped forward and peered 
into the darkness. 

Behind the bars, something 
stirred. 

Jim reached back, unbuttoned 
the flap of his hip pocket and 
gripped the cool metal of his gun. 

Something moved behind the 
bars. It reached out, bunched itself, 
reached out. Something large and 
dark slid up the bars. 

Jim raised the gun. 

A hissing voice said quietly, 
“You are from some sort of law-en- 
forcement agency? Good.” 

Jim slid his thumb toward the 
stub of the light, so he could see 
more clearly. But the faint hissing 
voice went on, “Don’t. It will do no 
good to see me.” 

Jim’s hand tightened on the gun 
at the same instant that his mind 
asked a question. 

The voice said, “Who am I? 
Why am I here? If I tell you, it will 
strain your mind to believe me. 
Let me show you.” 

The room seemed to pivot, then 
swung around him faster and faster. 
A voice spoke to him from all sides; 
then something lifted him up, and 
at an angle. 

He stared at the dial, rapped it 
with his finger. The needle didn’t 
move from its pin. He glanced at 
the blue-green planet on the 
screen. Photon pressure was zero, 
and there was nothing to do but 



try to land on chemical rockets. 
As he strapped himself into the 
acceleration chair, he began to 
really appreciate the size of his bad 
luck. 

Any solo space pilot, he told 
himself, should be a good me- 
chanic. And an individual plane- 
tary explorer should be his own 
pilot, to save funds. Moreover, 
anyone planning to explore Ludt 
VI, with its high gravity and pres- 
sure, and its terrific psychic stress, 
should be strong and healthy. 

These requirements made Ludt 
VI almost the exclusive preserve 
of big organizations with teams of 
specialists. They sent out heavily 
equipped expeditions, caught a rea- 
sonable quota of spat, trained them 
on the way home, and sold the hid- 
eous creatures at magnificent prices 
to the proprietors of every dream 
parlor in the system. From this 
huge income, they paid their 
slightly less huge costs, and made a 
safe moderate profit on their in- 
vestment. With a small expedition, 
it was different. 

A small expedition faced risk, 
and a one-man expedition was risk- 
iest of all. But if it succeeded, the 
trained spat brought the same huge 
price, and there were no big-ship 
bills for fuel, specialists, power 
equipment, and insurance. This, he 
thought, had almost been a success- 
ful trip. There were three nearly 
trained spat back in his sleeping 
compartment.

But, though he was a competent 
trainer, a skilled explorer, a pass- 
able pilot, and in good physical 
condition, he was no mechanic. He 
didn’t know how to fix what had 
gone wrong. 

He sat back and watched the rim 
of the world below swing up in the 
deep blue sky. 

HP HERE was a gray fuzziness. 
^ Jim was standing in the dark, 
seeing the bars shining faintly be- 
fore him. 

The black knot still clung to 
the bars. 

Somewhere in the old mansion, 
a phone began to ring. 

Jim said, in a low voice, “You 
were the pilot?” 

“No. I was the spat. The others 
died in the crash. Some of your 
race found me and we made a — 
an agreement. But it has worked 
out differently here than I ex- 
pected. The experiences I stimulate 
in your minds are enjoyable to you 
and to me. Yet either the structure 
of your brains is different from that 
of the pilot, or you lack training in 
mind control. You cannot wipe 
away these experiences afterward, 
and though I can do it for you eas- 
ily, it is only temporary.” 

A door opened and shut down- 
stairs. There was a sound of feet 
on the staircase. 

The hissing began again. “You 
must go and bring help.” 

Jim thought of the rope and the 



trees. His hand tightened on the 
gun and he made no move toward 
the window. 

The hissing sound said, “I see 
your difficulty. I will help you.” 

There was the crack of a rifle, 
then several shots outside. Jim 
swung the shutter open, felt a faint 
dizziness, and looked down on a 
warm sunlit lawn some three feet 
below. 

A hissing voice said, “Take hold 
the rope. Now carefully step out. 
Loop the rope with your foot.” 

Somewhere in Jim’s mind, as he 
did this, there was an uneasiness. 
He wondered at it as he climbed 
up the rope to the bar overhead, 
swung up onto the bar, slipped and 
nearly lost his grip. He could see 
the bar was steady and solid, and 
he wondered as it seemed to move 
under him. The green lawn was 
such a short distance down that 
there clearly was little danger, and 
he wondered why his breath came 
fast as he swung around on the bar, 
slid down to a sort of resting place 
where he put on climbing irons 
before starting down again. Always 
on the way down, the whistling 
voice told him that it was just a 
few feet more, just a few feet, as 
bit by bit he made his way down, 
and suddenly heard shots, shouts, 
and a repeated scream. 

Jim stepped off onto the soft 
lawn, stumbled, and knelt to take 
off the climbing irons. His heart 
pounded like a trip-hammer. He 



36 



GALAXY 



realized there was a blaze of spot- 
lights around him. He saw lights 
coming on in the mansion, and 
memory returned in a rush. He 
drew in a deep shaky breath, 
glanced at the tree, then saw a lit- 
tle knot of people near the base of 
the tower. He walked over, recog- 
nized Walters in the glow of the 
lights and saw a still figure on the 
ground. 

Walters said, “I shouldn’t have 
let him try it. Cover his face, Cul- 
len.” 

Cullen bent to draw a coat up 
over the head of the motionless 
figure, which was twisted sidewise. 

Jim looked down. 

He saw his own face. 

TIE was aware of darkness and 
of something hard beneath 
him. Voices came muffled from 
somewhere nearby. He heard the 
sound of a phone set in its cradle, 
the slam of a door, the scrape of 
glass on glass. He breathed and 
recognized a choking smell of cigar 
smoke. 

Jim sat up. 

Nearby was the model of the 
mansion. Jim swung carefully to 
his feet, made his way across the 
room, and opened the door to the 
next office. He blinked in the bright 
light, then saw Walters look up and 
grin. “One more night like this and 
I retire. How do you feel?” 

“I ache all over and I’m dizzy. 
How did I get here?” 



“I was afraid your going in there 
might misfire and touch off their 
escape, so I had the place sur- 
rounded. We saw you go in, there 
was about a five-minute pause, and 
the shutters seemed to come open. 
A figure came out. Then there was 
the crack of a rifle from the dormer 
window of a house across the street. 
I sent some men into that house, 
and the rest of us closed in on the 
mansion. We used the spotlights on 
our cars to light the place. We’d 
just found what we thought was 
your body — with a broken neck — 
when there was a thud behind us. 
There you were, and the other 
body was gone. 

“Right then, I thought it was 
going to be the same as usual. But 
this time we nailed several men 
and women in quite a state of con- 
fusion. Some of them have finger- 
prints that match those from the 
first place we raided. We don’t 
have the equipment yet, because 
that tower staircase was boarded 
up tight . What’s wrong?” 

Jim told his own version, add- 
ing, “Since that shot came be- 
fore I opened the shutters, the ‘fig- 
ure’ you saw go up the rope must 
have been an illusion, to fool who- 
ever had the gun across the street. 
And since I heard someone run- 
ning up the stairs a few minutes 
before you came in, I don’t see 
how the stairs can be boarded up.” 

Walters sat up straight. “An- 
other illusion!”

Jim said, “It would be nice to 
know if there’s any limit to those 
illusions.” 

Walters said, “This afternoon, 
we tried looking at those shutters 
through field glasses. Beyond about 
four hundred feet, you could see 
the broken slats. So there’s a limit. 
But if there’s no equipment, tfris is 
uncanny, ‘spat’ or no ‘spat.’” 

Jim shook his head. “I don’t 
know. You can use the same elec- 
tromagnetic laws and similar com- 
ponents to make all kinds of de- 
vices— radios, television sets, elec- 
tronic computers. What you make 
depends mainly on how you put 
the parts together. It may be that 
in the different conditions on some 
other planet, types of nerve com- 
ponents similar to those we use 
for thought might be used to cre- 
ate dangerous illusions in the 
minds of other creatures.” 

“That still leaves us with a prob- 
lem. What do we do with this 
thing?” 

“I got the impression it was like 
a merchant who has to sell his 
wares to live. Let- me go back and 
see if we can make an agreement 
with it.” 

“I’ll go with you.” 

Jim shook his head. “One of us 
has to stay beyond that four- 
hundred-foot limit.” 

HP HE stairs were narrow leading 
up into the tower. Jim found 
weary men amidst plaster and bits 



of board at a solid barricade on the 
staircase. He scowled at it, then 
shouted up the stairs, “I want to 
talk to you!” 

There was a sort of twist in the 
fabric of things. Jim found himself 
staring at the wall beside the stairs, 
its plaster gone and bits of board 
torn loose. The staircase itself was 
open. He started up. 

Behind him, a man still staring 
at the wall said, “Did you see that? 
He went around somehow.” 

The back of Jim’s neck prickled. 
He reached a tall door, opened it, 
turned, and he was standing where 
he had been before. 

There was a faint hissing. “I am 
glad you came back. I can’t keep 
this up forever.” 

“We want to make an agree- 
ment with you. Otherwise, we’ll 
have to use force.” 

“There is no need of that. I ask 
only food, water, and a chance to 
use my faculties. And I would be 
very happy if the atmospheric 
pressure around me could be in- 
creased. Falling pressure tires me 
so that it is hard for me to keep 
self-control.” 

Jim thought of the first night, 
when there had been the appear- 
ance of light on mansion and 
grounds, but heavy clouds and 
only a thin moon in the sky. 

The hissing voice said, “It had 
stormed, with a sharp fall in at- 
mospheric pressure. I was ex- 
hausted and created a wrong illu- 



38 



GALAXY 



sion. Can you provide what I 
need?” 

“The food, water, and pressure 
chamber, yes. I don’t know about 
the opportunity to ‘use your facul- 
ties.’ ” 

“There is a painting in the world 
now that wasn’t there before. You 
and I did that.” 

“What are you driving at?” 

“I can’t increase skill where 
there has been no practice, no ear- 
nest thought or desire. I can’t help 
combine facts or memories where 
none have been stored. But within 
these limits I can help you and 
others to a degree of concentration 
few men of your world know.” 
“Could you teach us to concen- 
trate this way on our own?” 

“I don’t know. We would have 
to try it. Meanwhile, I have been 
here long enough to have learned 
that your race has used horses to 
extend their powers of movement, 
dogs to increase their ability to 
trail by scent, cows and goats to 
convert indigestible grass and 
leaves into foodstuffs. These all 
were your partners in the physical 
world. It seems to me that I am 
much the same, but in the mental 
world.” 

Jim hesitated. “Meanwhile, you 
can help us to forget these dream 
lives?” 

“Easily. But, as I say, the effect 
is not permanent.” 

Jim nodded. “I’ll see what we 
can do.” 



He went to tell Walters, who 
listened closely, then picked up the 
phone. 

ARLY the next morning, Jim 
climbed the steps to the high 
narrow door of the tower, put on 
dark glasses and went in. Right be- 
hind him came a corporal with 
a creepie-peepie TV transmitter. 
From outside came the windmill 
roar of helicopters, and, high up, the 
rumble of jets. 

The corporal opened the shut- 
ter and spoke quietly into the mi- 
crophone. A hissing voice spoke in 
Jim’s mind. “I am ready.” 

Jim said, “This entire place is 
being watched by television. If 
there is any important difference 
between what observers here re- 
port and what the cameras show, 
this place and everything in it will 
be destroyed a few seconds later.” 

“I understand,” said the hissing 
voice. Then it told him how to 
loosen one of the bars, and Jim 
loosened it and stood back. 

There was the sound of foot- 
steps on the staircase. A large 
heavy box with one end hinged 
and open was thrust in the door- 
way. 

On the floor, something bunched 
and unbunched, and moved past 
into the box. Jim closed the box 
and snapped shut the padlock. Men 
lifted it and started down the stair- 
case. Jim and the corporal fol- 
lowed. As they went out the front

door, heavy planks were thrown 
across to a waiting truck. Sweat- 
ing men in khaki carried the box 
up the planks into the truck. Then 
the rear doors swung shut, the en- 
gine roared, and the truck moved 
away. 

Jim thought of the truck's desti- 
nation, a pressure tank in a con- 
crete blockhouse under a big steel 
shed out in the desert. 

He looked around and saw Wal- 
ters, who smiled at him and held 
out a slim envelope. “Good work,” 
said Walters. “And I imagine some 
hundreds of ex-addicts reclaimed 
from mental hospitals are going to 
echo those sentiments.” 

Jim thanked him, and Walters 
led him to the car, saying, “Now 
what you need is sleep, and plenty 
of it.” 

“And how!” 

Once home, Jim fell into an 
exhausted sleep, and had a night- 



mare. In the nightmare, he 
dreamed that he woke up, and 
found himself in a bed in a room 
where a light curtain blew in at 
the window, and the morning sun 
shone brightly in. 

He sat up, and looked around 
carefully at the furniture, and felt 
the solid wall of the room as he 
asked himself a question that he 
knew would bother him again. 

Which was the nightmare? 

Then he remembered his fear 
as he climbed the tree, and Cul- 
len’s advice: “When things get 
tight, hold your mind on what to 
do next. Do that. Then think of the 
next step.” 

He thought a moment, then lay 
back and smiled. He might not be 
absolutely certain this was real. 
But even if it wasn’t, he felt sure 
he would win in the end. 

No nightmare could last forever.

A HUSBAND 



I admit it — he beat my time. But my day 



By WILLIAM W. STUART 



S OON, very soon now, the 
time will come for me to 
meet my wife’s husband. I 
can hardly wait. Every dog has 
his day and Professor Thurlow 
Benjamin has just about had it. 
Every day has its dog, too, and 
I am going to return to him with 
full five years’ interest the bad 
time he gave to me. The dog. 

Dog? Look, he stole my girl 
not once but twice. The second 
time he, you might say, took his 
time to beat my time — and left 
me behind to the bad time that 
belonged to him. Benji is — or 
he was and he will be — a 
scientifically sneaky, two-timing 
dog, and a dog’s life is what he 
gave me. But now, after nearly 
five years, time is on my side. He 
will get what, minute by minute, 
is coming to him not soon 
enough, but soon. 

Benji — Professor Thurlow 
Benjamin — was my oldest, 



closest friend. I was his. We 
hated each other dearly in the 
way that only two boyhood pals 
can and by chance or mischance 
that quality of bitter-friendly, 
boyish rivalry never left our re- 
lationship. Why? A woman, nat- 
urally. 

The first time we met, he was 
a tall, gangling, red-headed, big- 
nosed kid of nine. I, Bull (for 
Boulard) Benton, was shorter, 
stockier, heavier. Maybe not 
handsome exactly, but clean cut, 
very clean cut. Benji knocked a 
chip off my shoulder and I 
knocked his block off, but not 
without collecting a few lumps 
doing it. From then on, we fought 
together against anyone else. 
When no one else was handy, we 
fought each other. And naturally 
we each wanted what the other 
had. 

After high school, we roomed 
together at Burnington Univer-

is coming. Any minute now time is about to run out on him!

sity right there in our home town, 
Belt City. Benji was a brain, a 
scholar. I was an athlete. So he 
broke nearly every bone in his 
body trying to be a six-foot-three, 
one - hundred - and - thirty - nine- 
pound scatback, while I nearly 
sprained a brain that was deep, 
definitely deep, but maybe not 
quite as quick on its feet as 
some, trying for scholarship. 

The last year and a half at the 
university, the competition be- 
tween us narrowed down to a 
battle for Vera Milston, old Dean 
Milston’s statuesque daughter. 
That was all a mistake. I can see 
it now. So can Benji. But not 
then. 

¥~^EAN Milston was the dour- 
^^est, sourest, meanest old ty- 
rant ever to suspend a football 
captain for a couple of unimpor- 
tant “D”s. One afternoon in junior 
year at basketball practice — 



Benji was out, dragging around a 
cast — Jocko Bunter bet me ten 
I didn’t have the nerve to date the 
dean’s daughter. Well, hell, I’d 
seen her around, visiting the dean 
as regularly as I had to. She was 
a lot of girl. Tall, honey-blonde — 
a little on the regal, commanding 
side, and maybe her lips were 
a mite set over a chin that the old 
man should have kept to himself 
— but there are times when a 
young man doesn’t analyze the 
details as carefully as he might. 
She was built like nothing I had 
tackled all fall. 

So I took a chance, got a date, 
won ten, and that might and 
should have been that. She had a 
way of saying “No!” that made 
me think of her father. But, the 
thing was, Benji didn’t know 
about the bet. I dated her once. 
So he had to date her twice. 
Again, I didn’t analyze. I jumped 
to the conclusion Benji had the 



A HUSBAND FOR MY WIFE 



43 



hots for her and went to work 
to cut him out. 

That kept us busy the next 
year and a half and I led all the 
way. Vera and I got engaged at 
the spring prom to be married 
right after my graduation — 
which improved the odds on my 
graduating considerably. The 
dean was a grim old devil who 
considered Hamlet a comedy 
and could refuse anything to any- 
one — except Vera, and how 
could I have known it was fear 
rather than affection that made 
him give in to her? 

Anyway, perhaps the strain of 
passing me a diploma was too 
great. The next day the old devil 
passed on himself, and no matter 
where he may be sitting, I know 
he is happy as long as he can 
watch the others fry. But I 
shouldn’t grumble. He saved me, 
unintentional though it was. 

Vera, possibly having second 
thoughts as she looked over the 
Dean’s List, said she couldn’t 
marry me till after a reasonable 
period of mourning. The Army 
took me and rejected Benji. He 
stayed on for post-graduate study 
in physics. I told you he was a 
brain. 

A brain, but not equally acute 
in all fields. When I got back 
to Belt City three years later, 
Benji was already an assistant 
professor of physics — and Vera’s 
husband. They were settled in 



the old dean’s big, ancient house 
just off the campus and Benji 
was aiming — or being aimed — 
at a distinguished academic ca- 
reer. I came back to town with 
the idea of winding up the family 
insurance and real estate business 
and pulling out, mostly to keep 
away from them. 

It wasn’t, you understand, that 
I was carrying such a heavy torch 
for Vera. She hadn’t blighted my 
life; not then, that is. But it 
seemed to me that living in town 
with her and Professor Thurlow 
Benjamin — a gloating, trium- 
phant Benji, laughing at me be- 
cause he’d succeeded in marrying 
my girl — would be a real an- 
noyance. But, of course, when I 
hit town I had to call them and 
they had to invite me to dinner. 

For one time, anyway, I fig- 
ured I had to accept. I gritted 
my teeth and went. I never had 
a sweeter, more enjoyable even- 
ing in all my life. 

T GOT there about seven in the 
evening and walked up the 
steps to the big old porch on the 
dean’s house feeling a bit nervous 
and upset. I’d walked up those 
same steps often enough before, 
feeling nervous and upset, but 
this was different. I lifted the 
oversized brass knocker and rap- 
ped. Vera’s voice, coming from 
the back of the house someplace, 
cut through the evening air.

“Thurlow! Answer the door!” 

“Yes, sweets. I’m on my way, 
Vera hun bun.” That was Benji. 
Hun bun, yet! And his voice was 
misery. It cringed and whined. I 
grinned to myself and began to 
feel more cheerful. 

Benji let me in. His glasses 
were thicker and his hair thinner 
and he looked a lot older. But it 
was Benji, the same old lanky, 
gangling redhead; yet not the 
same, too. He had a hang-dog 
look that was new and suddenly 
I felt so good, I punched him 
playfully in the ribs. He winced 
— and didn’t even counter. If 
the fight hadn’t gone out of him, 
it had sure been watered down. 
We went on in to the parlor 
across the hall from the dean’s 
old study. Vera joined us. She 
didn’t look bad — at a glance. 
But if you checked right close, 
and I did, there was something 
in her look — a sharpness I 
hadn’t noticed before; her nose 
seemed bigger, beak-like; the 
broad, solid shoulders; deep-down 
grooves at the corners of her 
mouth. 

She threw her arms around me 
and kissed me. My temperature 
stayed steady and cool. 

“Boulard! Boulard, darling! 
You look marvelous!” 

I felt great, too. “Vera, girl. 
You’re as gorgeous as ever, radi- 
ant, blooming, still the campus 
goddess. And Mrs. Thurlow Ben- 



jamin now, hm-m? Old Benji is 
sure a lucky dog.” 

Benji forced a hollow laugh. 
Vera smiled a positive agreement. 

Then Benji sort of coughed 
out a faint note of hope and 
pleaded, “Vera, sweet, this is a 

— uh — an occasion, don’t you 
agree, dear? Don’t you — ah — 
do you think maybe I ought to 

— fix us all a drink?” 

“Thurlow! You drink far too 

much! You had a highball before 
dinner at Professor Dorman’s 
only night before last.” 

Almost — but not quite — I 
felt sorry for him. 

“Ah, well, Vera doll,” I said, 
“this is an occasion, after all. And 
I do want to drink a toast to you 
and Benji.” 

“Hmph.” 

“Especially you, the love of 
my life, lost now, but lovelier 
than ever.” 

“Boulard! . Well, Thurlow, 
don’t stand there like an idiot. 
Go mix us some drinks. And 
mind the line on the bottle.” 

And then she turned back with 
some more gush for me. I en- 
joyed it, knowing now what I 
had been saved from. In fact, as 
I said, I enjoyed the whole eve- 
ning; my playing up to Vera 
made her just that much rougher 
on Benji. Revenge bn Benji plus 
relief at what I had escaped made 
life seem pleasant, and right 
there and then I changed my 



A HUSBAND FOR MY WIFE 



45 



mind about leaving town. I de- 
cided to stay and settled down. 

WW/'ELL, I did settle, but not 
too far down. Instead of 
selling out Uncle George’s in- 
surance and real estate firm, I 
went to work in it. It was pros- 
perous enough and light work. 
There were plenty of girls around 
town if you got around, and I 
did. 

Looking back, those were the 
happy years. Naturally I kept 
seeing quite a bit of Vera and 
Benji. Rubbing it in? Sure, why 
not? Hell, half the pleasure in 
any success comes from giving a 
hard time to those who gave you 
a hard time. It may not be nice, 
but it is normal. 

I lolled in the shade and 
laughed; Benji sweated and suf- 
fered. His boss’s whip cracked 
merrily. He plodded ahead in 
the University Physics Depart- 
ment and fiddled around his lab 
whenever he could escape into 
it. 

Then there came a black Fri- 
day evening in early autumn. I 
was due at Benji’s for dinner, 
just him and me. Vera had gone 
up to Chicago that morning to 
see her ever-dying Aunt Bella 
and do some shopping. She would 
not be back till the next day so 
she called on me to keep an eye 
on Benji. 

So I was due for a quietly 



pleasant early evening listening 
to Benji talk about his sorrows. 
Then, I figured, Benji would go 
to his lab in the old dean’s study 
and I would go out on the town. 
I had a date, one of the very best, 
Starlight Glowe, formerly Daisy 
Hanzel, formerly an office clerk. 
She was a pert little strawberry 
blonde, cute, with a lot of good 
humor and a lot of everything 
else too; about as unlike Vera 
as a girl could be. That week she 
was between nightclub engage- 
ments, back in her old home 
town. And back in the old groove 
with me, too. I looked forward 
to the evening — first Benji’s 
troubles and then my own pleas- 
ures. 

I pulled up in front of Benji’s 
old place just at dusk. A late 
working lineman from Beltsville 
Power was fiddling around on 
the pole outside Benji’s lab room. 
“Hey, Mac,” he hollered, “you 
going in there? Look, tell the 
prof they’ll cut it in at seven 
ayem, huh? Can’t make it a min- 
ute sooner.” 

I nodded as I went up the 
steps and across the porch; 
knocked once. Walked on in — 
and stopped dead in the hallway 
to stare up the stairs. It was 
Benji, but not the Vera’s Benji 
I was used to. He was dressed 
in the evening clothes Vera got 
him to wear only at major facul- 
ty functions. He carried a cane, 



46 



GALAXY 



wore a flower. Tonight he was 
Benji, man about town, knight 
of the evening. Sharp. Cool. 
Cocky. 

He strutted on down the stairs 
and past me. He winked, grinned 
that dirty, sneaky grin of his I 
remembered all too well from the 
old days. At the door, he looked 
back over his shoulder, still grin- 
ning, and said, “Stick around a 
minute, Bull boy. I have some- 
thing to show you.” The door 
slammed shut. 

T couldn’t believe it; he wouldn’t 

dare. Then I heard my car, 
my new sport car, starting out- 
side and I swore, grabbing the 
doorknob. 

“Wait, Bull. You couldn’t catch 
me.” 

I spun around. Damned if it 
wasn’t old Benji, coming down 
the stairs again just as though it 
wasn’t impossible. This time he 
looked himself, but worse. He 
had on an old lab smock and a 
new hangover. He looked awful 
— but with a hint of satisfaction 
too, like remembering the time 
he’d had getting into such lousy 
shape. 

“Well, Bull boy,” he mumbled, 
wavering on down the steps, hold- 
ing the top of his head on with 
one hand, “come on out in the 
lab. Maybe we could find a little 
nip. And I have something tfl 
show you.” 



“So you said.” 

“Eh? Oh, yes, so I did. Last 
night, when I was going out.” 

“It was just now — only you 
went out all dressed up, and here 
you are all beat up. What’s this 
all about?” 

“Come on,” he said with a 
flash of temper. “When I get a 
hair or two of the dog, I’ll ex- 
plain it to you.” 

I followed him into his lab, 
the dean’s old study. It was the 
only thing Benji could call his 
own. Vera let him have it on the 
off-chance that he might find 
something important enough to 
give their social and financial 
position a boost. 

In the lab, Benji fished an 
amber-filled flask from the waste- 
basket under the old rolltop desk 
and poured himself a double, me 
a single, in a couple of big test 
tubes. I only half saw him out 
of a corner of the eye. 

What I was really looking at 
was a damned peculiar rig that 
filled up about a third of the 
space along the side wall next to 
the kitchen. It was — I couldn’t 
figure it. It looked something like 
one of those jungle gym outfits 
in the kids’ playgrounds. But 
there were wires running from it 
to half a dozen wall plugs, and a 
seat up in the middle with a 
bunch of dials and things. 

It was all odd, and oddest 
was the way it all sort of shim- 



A HUSBAND FOR MY WIFE 



47 



mered and blurred as I watched 
it. 

“What in hell is that?” I 
walked across the. lab toward it, 
reaching out. 

“Better not touch it, Bull. You 
might knock something out.” 

Since he put it like that, I 
raised my hand to grab hold of 
one of the cross bars by the seat 
in the center of the thing — and 
there I was resting comfortably 
on a small cloud in far outer 
space, watching a great spiral 
nebula whirling in infinite majes- 
ty through the vast, empty black- 
ness, and I thought about the 
mystery of the universe. I felt 
that if I could just reach out, I 
would have in my grasp the final 
answer. But then it drifted away 
and the nebula slowly narrowed 
and evolved into a great system 
of suns, planets, moons — and 
finally into the big, old chandelier 
in the dean’s study. 

VK/'HEN it all seemed to sta- 
bilize at that point, I sat 
up a little shakily. The room, 
Benji’s lab now, was still there. 
I stood up and felt lousy. My 
head ached. I looked around. 
Benji was sitting at the desk 
slumped over, his head on his 
folded arms. The flask of whis- 
key, half gone, was on the desk 
beside him. I emptied it out a 
little more, into me, and checked 
my watch. Six o’clock and the 




48 



GALAXY 



sky showed gray outside. I had 
been out all night. 

I put my foot on the base of 
Benji’s swivel chair and shoved 
hard. The chair rolled back, out 
from under him. He slumped 
down with a pleasing thud on 
the floor. He woke up with a 
pained expression that helped my 
headache a little. 

“Damn you, Benji,” I said, 
“you did that out of spite, to 
break my date with Daisy, I bet.” 
He yawned. “I told you you’d 
better not touch it.” 

“Because you knew then I’d 
have to go ahead and do it. It’s 
a wonder, with me knocked out, 
you didn’t go try to steal my 
girl.” 

“I did. I am.” 

“You what?” 

“I did go out with Daisy. I 
am with her now.” 

“Are you cracked? You are 
right here with me.” 

“True, but I am simultaneous- 
ly with Daisy.” He grinned reflec- 
tively. “And I don’t mind saying 
Daisy is much better company 
than you . Now wait, Bull. I 
know this is difficult for you to 
grasp, but it is a fact that I am 
in two places at the same time 
— only on different circuits. This 
is big, Bull, really big! After you 
help me with one or two details, 
I am going to share it with you. 
Listen to me.” 

Sometimes I can be sickening- 



ly gullible. “All right. Start ex- 
plaining.” 

“Think, Bull! Last night you 
saw me go out the front door. 
At substantially the same time, 
you also saw me, dressed quite 
differently, come down the hall 
stairs. It should be obvious. I 
have built a time machine.” 

I looked down at my watch 
and then back at him, with raised 
eyebrows. 

“No, Bull. Not a machine for 
telling time; a machine for trav- 
eling through time or, actually, 
more or less around it. You see 
my machine there.” 

The jungle gym rig was still 
at the side of the room, blurred 
and shimmering. “Yeah, I see it. 
And don’t bother telling me not 
to touch it again. I won’t.” 

“Your own fault. Ordinarily 
you could touch even one of the 
bars; it is perfectly safe. But just 
now the machine is there twice. 
That creates further static force 
fields.” 

“Benji — ” 

“Look at it. Looks as though 
you were seeing double, hm-m? 
And you are. You see, Bull, this 
coming morning at ten to seven, 
I took — and will take — the 
machine and I traveled back to 
ten to five yesterday afternoon. 
At that time the machine was al- 
ready there. Actually, I should 
have moved it just before I used 
it this morning, to limit the over- 



50 



GALAXY 



laps. But I was rushed. You’ll see. 
Daisy and I will be here shortly.” 
He grinned. It was an expression 
I had never particularly cared 
for. “Have another drink, Bull.” 
That was an expression I liked 
better. I did have one. His story 
was unbelievable. But I was be- 
ginning to believe it — partly 
because of the machine there and 
the fact that I had seen two of 
him practically at once the eve- 
ning before, partly because I knew 
Benji would be capable of al- 
most anything if it would let 
him steal a girl from me and get 
away from Vera besides. 

TTE took a short nip himself 
and went on. “I won’t strain 
your limited facilities by trying 
to give you the technical side of 
it. More or less, it is a matter 
of setting up the proper number 
of counteracting magnetic force 
fields, properly focused, in a 
proper relationship each with the 
other to bend the normal space 
factors in such a way as to cir- 
cumvent time. Is that clear?” 
“Not to me,” I said. “Is it to 
you?” 

“Not altogether. But what is 
clear is this. My machine works. 
I can jump through time. To any 
time.” 

“Got any special messages 
from Cleopatra?” 

“The amount or period of time 
is a question of power. With only 



the regular house current I have 
connected now, about a day at 
a step is the limit. That is as far 
as I have gone. Of course I could 
go one day and then another and 
then another, forward or back, 
indefinitely. With more current, 
there would be no such limita- 
tions.” 

“How about taking a run up 
to the end of the week and let 
me know how the World Series 
is going to come out?” 

“Ah, now you begin to see! I 
told you this is a big thing — 
tremendous! And all I ask is just 
a little help from you, and you 
will share in the proceeds.” 
“What, me help? How?” 

“I had the power company run 
in a special power line yesterday. 
It will cut in this morning at 
seven. With this added power, 
the machine can travel five years. 
Five years at a jump, which as 
far as I — we, that is — want 
to go.” 

“Well, just suppose what you 
say is true, Benji. If it is, then 
you used your sneaky machine to 
two-time me with Daisy last 
night, eh? I like that. Vera will 
like that, too. But you expect to 
bribe me with a share in your 
rig to help you out. How? With 
what?” 

“Bull, it’s like this. I did go 
out last night, my first time in 
a long time. You know Vera. So, 
considering the past few years, 



A HUSBAND FOR MY WIFE 



51 



you can understand that I was 
— uh — maybe a bit reckless 
last night, ran into a few little 
problems. Nothing serious, of 
course. And besides, with your 
help, the police won’t be able — ” 
“The police?” 

“Yes. But, Bull, you’ve been 
right here with me all night. You 
can swear to that. So I couldn’t 
possibly have driven your car up 
the steps and through the glass 
doors into the ancient history 
section of the museum.” 

“My car!” 

“Now, Bull, we’ll make money 
- — you can get lots of cars. And 
I didn’t mean to smash up yours. 
I simply wanted to give Daisy 
a rough idea of a time trip back 
into the past. But you can tell 
the police I was right here when 
someone broke out through the 
window by the Neanderthal ex- 
hibit while the police were com- 
ing in the front door after us. So 
someone else must have driven 
off in the police car.” 

“You stole the police car?” I 
yelped. 

we won’t keep it,” he 
said airily. “But perhaps 
they are upset about our borrow- 
ing it and about the duet of ‘As 
Time Goes By’ that Daisy and 
I sang over the police radio.” 
“Lord! And when did you fin- 
ish all this fun and games?” I 
demanded. 



“When? Let’s see. It’s 6:40a.m. 
So we — Daisy and I — are on 
our way back here now. In the 
patrol car.” 

“Now? You and Daisy? In the 
patrol car?” 

“The one we borrowed. The 
police — they seem to have a 
lot of cars — are not far behind. 
I believe they think they recog- 
nized me. You can tell them how 
wrong they are.” 

He stopped to listen. I heard it 
too, a sound of sirens in the dis- 
tance, coming closer. 

“So, Benji. In a minute or so, 
you — a second edition of you, 
when one has always been plenty 
— you are coming here, with all 
the cops in town on your tail, and 
with my girl. And you expect me 
to step forward and, lying in my 
teeth, tell these enraged cops that 
you are innocent. This is quite 
a request, Benji” 

There was the roar of a car 
racing down the quiet, Saturday- 
dawn street. Benji looked at me 
anxiously. “Here we come. Bull, 
please! You wouldn’t turn me 
over to the police. Would you?” 

No, I didn’t want the cops to 
get him. I wanted to get him 
myself — and let Vera finish 
him. 

There was a sound of running 
footsteps up the porch stairs. The 
hallway door opened. Arm in 
arm, laughing like a pair of idiots, 
in came Benji — Benji II — and 



52 



GALAXY 



my girl, Daisy. They staggered 
across the room. Benji II threw 
his arms around Daisy and kissed 
her with conviction and assur- 
ance. Then, quickly, he stepped 
away from her and walked over 
to the time-machine rig. 

“Hurry it up,” said the first 
Benji, “quick. The power will cut 
off any second now, until they 
switch in the new line.” 

Drunk or not, Benji II knew 
what he was doing. He dragged 
the straight chair by the wall to 
the side of the machine and 
climbed it. He swayed, almost 
fell. Then, without touching any 
of the bars, he managed to step 
from the chair into the seat of 
the machine rig. He fiddled with 
a dial or knob — and vanished. 
The double exposure look of the 
machine disappeared too. 

“Benji,” said Daisy, staring 
blankly at the machine. 

“Daisy,” said the leftover Ben- 
ji, walking toward her. The sound 
of sirens outside sounded loud 
and louder — and then moaned 
to a stop in front of the house. 

“Benji,” Daisy said again, giv- 
ing me and the sirens about as 
much attention as an individual 
ant gets at a family picnic, “Ben- 
ji, it was true then! All that you 
were telling me about going 
through time was true! And we 
can — ” 

“Of course, sweet. I told you 
I’d be with you, that everything 



will be all right, with good old 
Bull to help us. What time have 
you, Bull?” 

“Hah?” I was dazed. 

“The time? What time is it?” 
“It’s just about seven. But — ” 
Heavy footsteps pounded up 
the front stairs and across the 
porch. The front door knocker 
thundered. 

“Bull,” said Benji, “Bull, old 
friend. I think there may be 
someone at the door. Would you 
see who it is?” 

T don’t know why I didn’t make 
him go answer. I still don’t 
know. But I walked out into the 
hall from the lab and opened the 
front door — and nearly got 
trampled by a squad of four cops, 
headed by big, tough Sergeant 
Winesap. There were, I saw 
through the open door, two squad 
cars parked out front and an- 
other coming down the block, 
just behind a taxi. 

“Oh,” said Winesap, “it’s you, 
Benton. Say, you weren’t in this 
crime wave, too, were you? We 
only saw two, that madman 
friend of yours, Professor Benja- 
min, and the girl, in your car . 
Look, you know what they did? 
They knocked off three hydrants 
whooping about time and the 
fountain of youth, and wrecked 
the museum, and the police car 
— and what they did to Officer 
Durlin . Maybe you weren’t 



A HUSBAND FOR MY WIFE 



53 



in on it, Benton, but we know 
they came in here. Friend or no 
friend, don’t try to obstruct jus- 
tice. Where are they?” 

“Yes, officer?” inquired Benji, 
bland as could be, from the lab 
door. “What seems to be the 
trouble? Did you wish to see 
me?” 

His manner must have been 
disarming. At least they didn’t 
shoot him on the spot. They just 
advanced, loosening guns in hol- 
sters, like a thoughtful lynching 
party. Benji strolled back into 
the lab and over to Daisy, who 
was standing by the machine at 
the side of the room. 

The officers were confused. 
Benji, sober or nearly so, in his 
old lab smock, looked a good 
deal different to them from the 
wild man they’d been chasing 
all over town. But there was 
Daisy in her evening gown. 

“That’i. them, all right,” said 
a young rookie with a fine-bloom- 
ing shiner. “She’s the one that 
threw the eggplants. I’d know 
her anywhere.” 

“And that’s Benjamin,” said 
Winesap, grimly. “Okay, both of 
you, don’t try to run. Come along 
and no more nonsense.” 

Benji held up one hand — and 
slipped the other arm around 
Daisy’s waist. “Gentlemen, please! 
I have no idea what this is about. 
But surely it can have nothing 
to do with me. Mr. Benton and 



I have been right here in my 
laboratory all night, working. He 
can verify that.” 

They looked at me. I opened 
my mouth. I didn’t say a word. 

Vera did. She stood there in 
the doorway. It must have been 
her in the cab, coming back 
bright and early from Chicago. 
She took in the whole scene. Ben- 
ji. Daisy. Police. Me. 

“Benji!!!” she said. You couldn’t 
imagine what she put into that 
one word. 

Everyone turned then to look 
at her. Slowly and with infinite 
menace, she started across the 
room. 

“Now, dear,” said Benji ner- 
vously, “now, sweet, take it easy. 
This is only a little experiment. 
Not what you are thinking at 
all.” 

We swung back toward Benji. 
He had boosted Daisy onto the 
seat of his time rig and swung up 
beside her. Vera yelled and 
started to run toward them. 

Benji twisted a knob and grin- 
ned. “Good-by now,” he said. And 
they were gone. 

Benji was gone again. Daisy 
was gone. The whole rig was 
gone. 

’ITERA, looking a little forlorn 
" and foolish, ended up her 
dash stumbling into the empty 
space where the thing had been. 
I expect we all looked a little 



54 



GALAXY 



foolish, standing there, gaping. 
But I had to carry foolishness to 
the ultimate of idiocy. 

Vera at that single moment 
seemed sort of sad and helpless. 
And, Lord knows, I was mixed 
up. I walked over and put an 
arm around Vera, saying, “There, 
there, Vera, hon. It’s all right. I’m 
here.” 

I should never have called her 
attention to it. There I was — 
and, the hell of it was I had kept 
playing up to her all this time 
just to needle Benji. When, that 
morning, I put my arm around 
her, I never had a chance. 

I was married. To Vera. I still 
am. It has been a long, long time. 
Almost five years by the calen- 
dar, centuries by subjective time. 

I am Vera’s husband, sitting by 
the light of a kerosene lamp in 
Dean Milston’s old study, which 
had been Benji’s lab, writing. 
Benji and Daisy got away and I 
got caught. But now I can smile 
about it. Now, after nearly five 
years. 

You understand? 

With the power he got into 
his machine from the new power 
line, he said he could go just five 
years at a jump. Of course, away 
from Vera. Probably he figured 
on going further, that he would 
go the power limit of five years, 
stop, and then jump again, and 
again, far enough for complete 
safety. 



But I have had a lot more 
time to figure than he did. I am 
figuring on a little party; a little 
reception in honor of our first 
intrepid time traveler. A surprise 
party. 

It will be five years to the 
hour since Daisy and Benji left. 
Benji will be the surprise, since 
only I know that he will pop up 
in our midst. It will surprise 
Benji. It will surprise Vera — 
and our guests, among whom I 
have included Sergeant (Captain 
now) Winesap and the others of 
his squad. 

Eccentric, a party like that? 
I suppose. But, to Vera and the 
others, it is a breakfast anniver- 
sary party — the anniversary of 
the very moment of our engage- 
ment. Vera is flattered enough to 
be tolerant and even pleased at 
this romantic notion. And, since 
I know I have only one out and 
that it is coming, I am a dutiful 
— cringing and servile, that is — 
husband. So Vera indulges me in 
a harmless eccentricity or two. 

My other little eccentricity is 
electric power — I don’t favor 
it. I use Benji’s lab, the old dean’s 
study, as my den. I claim to be 
writing a historical novel. I need 
realism, atmosphere. I have had 
all electric power lines removed 
from that entire section of the 
house. There is no power. None. 

That’s why I’m writing by 
lamplight. 



A HUSBAND FOR MY WIFE 



55 



Our anniversary party will be 
here. The lamps and candles and 
the dawn of a bright new day 
will be light enough when, to the 
total astonishment of Vera and 
our guests, Benji and Daisy and 
the time rig suddenly appear 
among us. I will greet them with 
enthusiasm — but this will be 
as nothing to the greeting they 
will get from other sources. Ben- 
ji will work his dials and controls, 



frantically. Nothing will happen. 
No power. 

Vera will step forward. The 
hell with whether the statute of 
limitations may or may not have 
run out on Benji’s assorted legal 
crimes and misdemeanors. The 
wrath of Vera accepts no limita- 
tions. 

Benji will have run out of time 
and it will be my time then.

HOW TO SLAY DRAGONS 

T HE discussion I have in 
mind in writing this took 
place in Long Beach, Cal- 
ifornia, and it happened to be in 
German. It also got nowhere, but 
the locality had nothing to do 
with this; the result would have 
been the same in Chicago, New 
Orleans, New York, London or 
West Berlin. The problem invol- 
ved several unknowns and such 
discussions tend to get out of 
hand no matter when or where. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION

That the conversation was in 
German is a little more to the 
point because my indubitably 
honorable but less than learned 
opponent kept quoting books 
written in that language and 
never translated, as far as I know. 

There were four books he kept 
bringing up. 

The first of them was Hanns 
Horbiger’s World Ice Doctrine, 
published in Germany about 
1910. By way of explanation, I 
have to say that this 800 page 
quarto volume attempted to ex- 
plain the origin of the Solar Sys- 
tem, the nature of the Sun and 
geological history. Since this 
attempt was made long before 
anything definite about atomic 
energy became known, it mis- 
fired, of course. You can succeed 
in understanding the nature of a 
star to about the same extent if 
you don’t know about nuclear 
physics as you can in building 
a jet plane of wood and bricks. 

The second book was by one 
Dr. Edgar Dacque, published 
about 1925, and was an attempt 
to turn evolution around. What 
Dacque tried to show was that 
the “human line” was the central 
line of evolution; in other words, 
that all living creatures above the 
level of single-celled organisms 
had descended from Man. 

The third one was a book on 
Atlantis of about 1900 vintage 
and the fourth one was Velikov- 



sky’s ridiculous Worlds in Col- 
lision. 

Vjf/'HAT these four authors had 
’ ’ in common was that they 
laid an enormous stress on leg- 
ends. Hanns Horbiger had ran- 
sacked the world’s store of leg- 
ends to prove his own ideas. One 
of his pet ideas was that at one 
time recently (geologically 
speaking) a moon of Earth had 
collided with us. So he hauled 
out every legend dealing with 
fire in the sky, the Norse gods 
battling in the sky, Biblical ref- 
erences to stars falling from the 
sky, and so forth and so on. 

Edgar Dacque repeated the 
game; he added to Horbiger’s 
store of legends — in the mean- 
time, ethnologists had written 
some twenty books or so about 
tribal legends in various corners 
of the Earth — and quoted a 
whole set of different legends, 
those that might be twisted into 
having a bearing on evolution 
and the past in general. (His main 
source was a large work by Ben 
Gurion. I often wondered what 
Ben Gurion himself thought 
about all this.) 

The man who wrote the Atlan- 
tis book had also quoted a large 
number of “age-old” legends, 
some of which were not so “age- 
old” at all, having been taken 
from a novel by the Hungarian 
writer Maurus Jokai. And, of 



58 



GALAXY 



course, Velikovsky, whose book 
was full of the most surprising 
similarities to Horbiger’s work, 
also stressed heavily that what he 
said explained ancient legends 
and w&s, in turn, bolstered by 
them. 

Our fruitless discussion revol- 
ved around the question of just 
how valuable a legend is, or can 
be. “You yourself,” my opponent 
said, “have written in one of your 
books that African natives had a 
legend about the okapi. Then it 
was discovered.” I pointed out 
that the natives did not have a 
“legend” about the okapi; they 
talked about it matter-of-factly. 
That some of the white explorers 
labeled the talk “legend” because 
they happened not to know the 
animal at the time was exclusive- 
ly their fault. 

“All right,” said my opponent, 
“let’s take an old legend then. 
Don’t you think that the old 
legend of the dragon reflects a 
memory of the dinosaurs?” 

I said no, I don’t think so and 
that I have many reasons for not 
thinking that they do, the point 
being mostly that the dragon it- 
self is a fairly late invention 
which cannot be traced back 
even as far as the time of Christ. 

By that time my opponent, 
rather exasperated, asked the 
crucial question: “Don’t you 

think that a legend has been 
caused by something?” He was 



probably surprised when I said 
yes, certainly a legend is caused 
by something, some event. But 
unless you can establish the facts 
by other means, you will never 
be able to reconstruct the origi- 
nal event from the later legend! 

As an example, I offered the 
story of the Lindwurmdenkmal 
in Klagenfurt in Austria, which 
happened to be fresh on my 
mind. Just two days earlier, I 
had met a man who had seen 
this monument before the war 
and wanted to know if I had any 
information — whether it had 
survived the war intact, or dam- 
aged, or not at all. 

'T'RYING to describe the Lind- 
wurmdenkmal in detail would 
be a waste of time since I can 
offer an illustration, Fig. 1. I only 
have to add that Lindwurm is the 
Germanic equivalent of “dragon” 
and that Denkmal means “mon- 
ument.” The location is the cen- 
tral square of the city of Klagen- 
furt where it was placed with 
proper ceremonies on June 2, 
1636. The monument consists of 
two figures, a club-swinging giant 
and the dragon. It does not seem 
to be known who sculpted the 
figure of the giant, but the dragon 
was carved from stone from the 
nearby Kreutzberg by the sculp- 
tor Ulrich Vogelsang in 1590. 

Legend has it that the skull 
of the dragon was found in 1335 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



59 







at the Zollteld — the name means 
“customs field;” presumably some 
ducal boundary line ran through 
there at one time — in the vi- 
cinity of Klagenfurt. A gravel 
pit on this field is still called the 
dragon’s pit. 

These are the facts. 

Now try to reconstruct from 
this legend what really hap- 
pened; try to guess at the “origi- 
nal event.” Well, obviously the 
dragon is actually the memory of 
large inimical animals which 
once existed; if not a memory of 
the dinosaurs, it might be a 
memory of large man-eating liz- 
ards of some kind. Mind you, 
the legend does not necessarily 
prove that these man-eating liz- 
ards lived around Klagenfurt, 
but it does seem to prove that 



such animals existed at one time 
and that our remote forefathers 
had trouble with them. 

How about the shape — spe- 
cifically the bat wings attached 
to the body of a lizard? Well, the 
shape is so traditional that it 
probably reflects the real shape 
of whatever it was, and as for 
the wings, who can say that they 
did not have wings in reality? Of 
course one might conclude that 
the wings are just symbolic, indi- 
cating that these animals were 
very fast. All reptiles can move 
fast, can’t they? Have you ever 
seen a lizard turn around and 
run, or seen a snake strike? 

(Having kept lizards, frogs 
and snakes for many years of 
my life, I know this fact well.) 

All right, now let's go on to the 



6Q 



GALAXY 



giant who slays the dragon. What 
about him? 

Well, in the first place, can 
one say that there never were 
giants? But it is possible that the 
meaning of the giant is symbolic, 
too. Just as the wings of the drag- 
on — if they are symbolic — 
signify speed, so the large size of 
the giant might be taken to sym- 
bolize the incredible courage of 
our remote ancestors who stood 
up against these animals. 

I did not make up these argu- 
ments. I could have quoted just 
this kind of reasoning from 
books, giving title, author, date 
and place of publication and page 
number, if desired. But that 
would have taken at least three 
times as much space as this con- 
densation did. 

At any event, these arguments 
have been seriously offered by 
people like Horbiger and Dacque. 
They sound reasonably logical 
and require only one two-part 
assumption, namely that a legend 
must have a cause and that this 
cause can be reconstructed by 
careful reasoning. 

Fortunately, more than I have 
told so far is known in the case 
of the Lindwurmdenkmal, and 
because more is known, we can 
really reconstruct the background 
for the legend. The important 
point is that we cannot recon- 
struct it from the legend. 



Vkf/'HEN Ulrich Vogelsang car- 
ved his dragon, he had a 
model to go by — not a model 
of the whole animal, but at least 
a model for its head. He had the 
skull from the “dragon’s pit” 
which had been found 235 years 
earlier. The nice thing about it 
all is that we still have the skull; 
it has been preserved in the Mu- 
nicipal Museum of the city of 
Klagenfurt. 

It is the skull of a woolly 
rhinoceros of the Ice Age, known 
to zoologists and paleontologists 
as Rhinoceros ( Tichorhinus ) an- 
tiquitatis. Its nearest living rela- 
tive is the white rhino of Africa.

You can see how the back- 
ground splits right at this point 
into two backgrounds. 

On the one hand, we have the 
background of the skull, which 
involves many thousands of man 
hours of scientific spade work 
(you can take the term literally, 
if you want to) leading to a 
knowledge of the Ice Age and 
the different kinds of animals 
which then inhabited Europe. 
Some of them including — or 
rather especially — the woolly

rhinoceros certainly were a men- 
ace to “our remote ancestors.” 
On the other hand, you have 
the background for the remainder 
of the dragon. Can we sit back 
here and let the legend hunters 
take over, acting like the Great 
Detective who shuts himself up 
with his pipe and reasons it all 
out while the dumb policemen 
have to go around checking laun- 
dry marks, dental records and 
ringing doorbells? In reality, it 
is the police who get the results, 
and with some checking — of 
old books in this case — we can 
trace the remainder of the drag- 
on, too. 



The word “dragon” comes 
from the Greek drako, which was 
the term used for especially large 
snakes; simply large snakes of 
the python type. The Germanic 
word lind (or lint ) also just 
means snake. Readers familiar 
with the N ibelungenlied may re- 
call, at this point, that the leaf 
which fell between Siegfried’s 
shoulder blades, producing his 
one vulnerable point, was a leaf 
from the Linden tree. Actually 
the two words have no known 
connection, but the similarity in 
sound made a good poetic alliter- 
ation, to an audience familiar 
with the word lind for snake.

Fig. 4: "Young Dragon" at pictured in Pierre Belon's book 



fT^HE name dragon — or Lind- 
wurm — therefore automati- 
cally suggested a snake-like body. 
Which again leaves the question 
of the wings. But these wings 
can be explained. The only as- 
sumption we have to make is 
that Ulrich Vogelsang had a few 
of the then better-known books 
to look at. We don’t even have 
to assume that he could read, 
though an artist in the year 1590 
probably could. 

The Frenchman Pierre Belon 
— latinizing his name into Pet- 
rus Bellonius — had published 
his works on natural history some 
30 years before that date, and 
in it is the picture of a “young 
dragon” (Fig. 4). It is the first 
picture where a dragon has wings. 
The reason: around the middle 
of the 16th century, the Javanese 



tree lizard — which later was 
called, half-jokingly, Draco vo- 
lans or “flying dragon” — became 
known. It is a small lizard, with 
a maximum length of about four 
inches, which has a “parachute.” 
Half a dozen “false ribs” stick 
out from its body, connected by 
a membrane. The membrane can 
be stretched out or partly folded, 
but otherwise these “wings” can- 
not move. 

There you have the origin of 
the dragon shape of the monu- 
ment: the skull of an extinct 
rhinoceros, the body from the 
name, and the wings from Pierre 
Belon’s poor and probably sec- 
ond-hand drawing of a Javanese 
tree lizard. 

And now I can go back to 
the argument about legends, and 
the two-part assumption that a 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



63 



legend must have a cause which 
can be discovered by reasoning. 
Yes to the first part; every leg- 
end certainly has a cause. But 
no to the second part; the legend 
itself very effectively cloaks its 
origin as a rule. Sometimes the 
cause can be unearthed, but only 
by the patient detail work which 
should have been applied in the 
first place. 



BRINGING THE MOON 
DOWN TO EARTH 

Q UITE a number of years ago 
— at a guess, about 1922 — 
I encountered the name of Andre 
Laurie for the first time. I was 
then reading the German biogra- 
phy of Jules Verne, written by a 
Dr. Max Popp who was evidently 
an early science fiction fan, be- 
cause nearly half of his 212-page 
book is devoted to stories of the 
Jules Verne type, but not written 
by Jules Verne. 

“The hero of Laurie’s story,” 
Dr. Popp wrote, “intends to es- 
tablish a connection between the 
Moon and the Earth by bringing 
the Moon to the Earth with the 
aid of an enormous magnet. The 
Moon does come uncomfortably 
close, but finally the friendly 
queen of the night proves to be 
more powerful than the magnetic 
mountain; the mountain is pulled 
out of the Earth and Laurie’s 



travelers inadvertently reach the 
Moon in this manner.” 

Naturally I did not remember 
that paragraph verbatim — I 
just now looked it up for the pur- 
pose of translating it — but its 
content stuck in my mind. I also 
remembered (this is mentioned 
elsewhere in Dr. Popp’s book) 
that this French novel bore an 
English title, Selene Company 
Limited. Sometimes, when I was 
in a library for different reasons 
and purposes, I would recall that 
there was an old French space 
travel novel I should read one 
day and checked the index cards 
for it, unsuccessfully each and 
every time. 

In between, whenever a new 
book on old science fiction ap- 
peared, I looked for Andre Laurie; 
maybe somebody would give a 
more complete synopsis. Nobody 
ever did. 

Matter of fact, nobody even 
mentioned Andre Laurie’s name. 
Philip B. Gove’s The Imaginary 
Voyage in Prose Fiction takes no 
notice of him. Neither does J. O. 
Bailey’s Pilgrims Through Space 
and Time, which is remarkable 
for its omissions all the way 
through. But even Marjorie Nic- 
olson in her Voyages to the 
Moon doesn’t have a word to say 
about Laurie — possibly because 
he is too close to the present to 
be deserving of her rather pat- 
rician notice. 



64 



GALAXY 



The only place I found some- 
thing about him is in Kenneth 
Allott’s American Jules Verne 
biography where Allott says, with 
reference to the year 1885: “The 
only other publication that year 
was a work in collaboration with 
Andre Laurie — The Wreck of 
the Cynthia. Laurie admired 
Verne greatly and followed in his 
footsteps, writing scientific ro- 
mances that had a wide circula- 
tion in France.” 

I finally got a copy of Laurie’s 
book from an antiquarian, an 
English translation (called The 
Conquest of the Moon ) pub- 
lished in 1894 in London. A label 
pasted inside states that this copy 
was awarded by B. Brucesmith, 
Esq., Principal of the Byron 
House and Ealing Grammar 
School, to William Henry Sin- 
nott for being 1st in a class of 
23 boys in Bookkeeping. I won- 
der whether the award winner 
ever read this book, which is 
rather removed from bookkeep- 
ing and, if so, what he thought 
of it. 

Well, I read it. About 1:30 in 
the morning, my wife started 
complaining and I retired to my 
study with a bottle of wine, two 
cigars and the book. Is the book 
that, wonderful? Yes, in the same 
way as the woman in England 
who was so incredibly ugly that 
no man could take his eyes off 
her. 



T^R. POPP had summarized 
the main theme quite well. 

A French astronomer has the 
idea of bringing the Moon closer 
to the Earth and reasons that a 
sufficiently large magnet must be 
built to accomplish this feat. 
(Don’t ask me why a magnet 
of any size should influence the 
Moon.) He looks for a mountain 
of pure iron ore which could be 
magnetized and finally finds one, 
by lucky coincidence in the 
French Sudan. The French Su- 
dan was in various kinds of revolt 
and political troubles at the time, 
which helped to fill the book with 
all kinds of sub-plots. 

When the mountain is found, 
the necessary money is raised — 
in Australia, of all places — and 
the work begins. First the base 
of the mountain is insulated by 
pouring molten glass into spaces 
made for the purpose. The engi- 
neering aspects of the venture 
are rather vague, but there is the 
interesting touch that the energy 
is furnished by solar collectors. 
At about the time Laurie wrote 
the book, the French Professor 
Mouchot (mentioned by Laurie) 
made experiments with solar col- 
lectors and steam engines for 
pumping water for irrigation in 
North Africa. 

An observatory and living 
quarters are built on top of the 
mountain. Cables are wound 
around the mountain to convert

it into an electromagnet. Mean- 
while an army of Arab rebels 
lays siege to the observatory 
which, however, this possibility 
having been foreseen, is “well 
provisioned with everything.” 
The mountain is then magnetized 
and the astronomer predicts that 
within five days and a number 
of hours the Moon would be 
close enough to “be inside the 
Earth’s atmosphere.” 

Up to that point, the main 
quarrel of a present-day reader 
would be with a wrong premise 
and a ludicrous style which is 
partly the fault of an inept trans- 
lator. But then the scientific fun 
begins. 

Acted upon by the giant mag- 
net, the Moon comes closer and 
closer. 

But does that change its or- 
bital period? Oh, no — from 
everything that is mentioned, it 
is quite clear that its orbital ve- 
locity remains just what it al- 
ways was. Even when closer than 
22,000 miles, it still rises in the 
egst and sets in the west. In 
reality, the Moon’s main behav- 
ior, aside from appearing larger 
in size, would be first an apparent 
slow-down in motion (due to the 
fact that its true orbital period 
would decrease so that its ap- 
parent motion would not be al- 
most exclusively due to the 
Earth’s turning on its axis) and 
then an apparent reversal with 



rising in the west and setting in 
the east. 

At the last moment, somebody 
in the observatory panics and re- 
verses the power, and that’s when 
the magnetized mountain is torn 
from its undermined foundations 
and pulled toward the Moon. 
The people in the observatory 
are knocked unconscious and, 
after awakening, first think that 
the Moon had struck the Earth. 
After a considerable time, they 
realize that their whole mountain 
has jumped to the Moon, luckily 
landing with its base first. 

T>Y that time — wonder of 
wonders — the Moon is back 
in its original orbit! (Kepler, 
Newton, Halley, Cassini, Gauss 
and a few dozen lesser lights 
must have orbited in their graves 
when this was printed.) The 
Moon did take a little air along 
so that the travelers have time 
to stuff rags into the cracks of 
the window frames and so forth. 

Now they have to make oxy- 
gen. Fortunately there are tons 
and tons of potassium chlorate 
among the provisions. This pro- 
vides them with the oxygen they 
need. While nothing was said as 
to how the oxygen was produced, 
I suspected that the figures were 
prodigiously wrong. After finish- 
ing the book (and getting my de- 
layed sleep) I took a handbook 
to check a few facts. Yes, my 



68 



GALAXY 



handbook is recent, but these 
particular facts could also be 
found in the handbooks of Andre 
Laurie’s time. 

The chemistry of the case is 
this: potassium chlorate — the 
formula is KCIO3 — melts at not 
quite 700 degrees Fahrenheit. 
When you heat it beyond its 
melting point, you get the follow- 
ing transformation: 

2 KCIO3 y 2 KCl + 3 o 2 

There is a small amount of prac- 
tical trouble involved. It does 
not work below the melting point 
of the substance, but at only 50 
degrees Fahrenheit above melt- 
ing point, the release of oxygen 
is so violent that it can almost 
be called an explosion. Nowadays 
we can make this safe by adding 
an oxide of manganese (MnO a ) 
which causes the same reaction 
at lower temperatures. I don’t 
know whether this was known at 
the time the book was written. 

More important is the fact that 
the decomposition of potassium 
chlorate will produce about two- 
fifths of its weight in pure oxy- 
gen. Allowing for poor equipment 
and other losses, we’ll say that 
every four pounds of potassium 
chlorate produce one pound of 
pure oxygen. 

Now what does Mr. Laurie’s 
hero do? 

As the lunar night approaches, 



he prepares the necessary oxygen 
for a dozen people for two weeks. 
So he decomposes 22 tons of 
potassium chlorate. Since this is 
a French book, these would be 
metric tons, totaling 48,501 lbs. 
avoirdupois. This would produce 
a minimum of 12,000 lbs. of oxy- 
gen, probably more, whereas 
twelve people will need about 
600 lbs. of oxygen in two weeks. 

Mr. Laurie has no excuse for 
this slip except the true one — 
he neglected to do his arithmetic. 
(That at another point the three 
villains dump something into a 
crater six million yards deep I 
take to be a translator’s error. 
The original probably read six 
mille metres, 6000 meters.) 

VW/'ELL, now, do I expect a 
"" novelist to calculate these 
things? The answer is: I do; but 
Monsieur Laurie did a few other 
things which are equally horrible 
and have nothing to do with 
arithmetic. For example, a dead 
man is found somewhere. A doc- 
tor who is a member of the party 
whips out his stethoscope to 
listen to the heartbeat and then 
remembers that there is no sound 
on the moon! He has to feel for 
the corpse’s pulse instead! It was 
known in Laurie’s day that not 
only air transmits sound. 

Then they find an ancient 
building of the long-dead selen- 
ites. They marvel at the size of

the structure, but they remember 
that “since the Moon’s gravity 
is only 1/6 of what we have on 
Earth, the foundations must be 
made more massive and dug 
deeper down in proportion.” 
Why? To support one-sixth as 
much weight? 

Once inside they see a number 
of artifacts “made of pure gold, 
now tarnished with age.” And I 
always thought that one of the 
attractive things about gold is 
that it does not tarnish or dis- 
color. It does not even dirty 
easily. 

And so it goes on. I just could 
not stop reading in incredulous 
but sustained amazement. In the 
end the travelers get home: they 
use their magnetic mountain once 
more to graze the Earth’s atmos- 
phere and then jump off with a 
large parachute. (Yes, the Moon 
snaps back into its orbit again.) 
Then they find that nobody will 
believe their tale. 

No question about it, the “good 
old science fiction” had more 
“sense of wonder” than today’s. 
Almost every page of The Con- 
quest of the Moon makes one 
wonder how it got by the author, 
editor, typesetter, proofreader 
and reader. 

This book aside, some of the 
good old science fiction was good. 
Now it is merely old. 

ANY QUESTIONS? 



1VTISS Petra Helmssen of Car- 
bondale, Illinois, writes me 
as follows: 

At a party recently, a young 
man said that he could write 
down, without any preparation, 
numbers of six figures all of 
which would be divisible by 13 
and also by 11. He made good 
his boast. Miss Helmssen wrote 
down a few of the numbers he 
produced, but states that he went 
on for almost an hour. The num- 
bers she transmitted to me were 
495,495; 318,318; 957,957 and 
101,101. The question was, “How 
did he do it?” 

I did not know how, but as I 
brooded over the numbers, the 
last one caught my interest. It 
was obviously a multiple of 1001. 
So were all the others, I saw, 
as soon as I realized the fact. 
Now 1001 is divisible by 13, by 
1 1 and, as you can find out easily, 
also by 7. In fact, 1001 is 7 times 
11 times 13. In order to produce 
figures divisible by 13 and by 11, 
you don’t have to do anything 
more strenuous than to mentally 
multiply 1001 with anything — 
anything at all. 

Mr. D. A. Turner of Visalia, 
California, has a far more serious 
problem on his mind. “Is it not 
possible, or even likely, that a 
few years from now a manned 
space vehicle might be rammed 
and destroyed by one of the 
many, many (by then) Sputnik- 



70 



GALAXY 



Vanguard-etc. satellites whizzing 
around Earth in their various 
and sundry orbits? Is this prob- 
lem of man-made space hazards 
being given any attention at this 
time?” 

The answer to the question is 
yes, naturally scientists are very 
much aware of this problem. One 
of the reasons why research satel- 
lites were placed on long ellipti- 
cal orbits with their perigees 
inside the atmosphere was that 
satellites in such orbits would 
clear themselves out of space 
again by gradual orbital decay 
and final burn-up. 

On January 1st, 1960, nine 
artificial satellites were in orbit; 
by December 31st, only six of 
these will be left. Three of them 
are expected to burn up this year 
— coincidentally, at about the 
time this issue will be on the 
newsstands, namely Sputnik III, 
Explorer VI and Discoverer VIII. 
Twenty years from now, only 
two will be still in orbit — Van- 
guard I and Russia’s Cosmic 
Rocket III, the one that took the 
first pictures of the far side of 
the Moon. 

In short, the intention, when a 
satellite is fired into orbit, is 
that it will burn up in the end. 
But every once in a while one 
happens to slip into an orbit 
where even the perigee is so high 
as to be outside the Earth’s at- 
mosphere. This happened with 



Vanguard I and was a more or 
less accidental result of the shot 
around the Moon. The latter 
could just as easily have run into 
the Earth on its first trip back. 

In time, a number of such ac- 
cidentally too-lucky shots will 
accumulate in space and. will 
have to be removed when the 
era of manned space flight ar- 
rives. What better way to take 
them out of space than by a 
manned maneuverable ship? 



TWO MEN AND ONE BIKE 

r T , HE riddles I stuck in just for 
fun in recent columns, such 
as the one about the number of 
hairs on a girl’s head, seem to 
have been received with enthu- 
siasm. Readers asked for more, 
although one sternly cautioned: 
“Don’t use the same that Martin 
Gardner has in the Scientific 
American I won’t. But here is 
another. 

The main means of transpor- 
tation in The Netherlands is the 
bicycle. Unlike bicycles else- 
where, Netherlands bikes must 
follow traffic regulations and pat- 
terns as if they were automobiles. 
Moreover, there is a strictly en- 
forced rule: three days in jail for 
both if the rider lets someone 
else ride on the handlebars. 

Now we have Cornelis Potgie- 
ter and Pieter van Gelderbrook

standing on a road. They both 
have to be in a place 10 kilo- 
meters away. They should arrive 
more or less at the same time. 
And they have only one bike. 

Says Cornelis: “Tell you what 
we do. Here is a key to my pad- 
lock, I’ll ride 500 meters ahead 
and chain the bike to a tree. You 
walk, then take the bike and ride 
500 meters. I keep walking in 



the same direction in the mean- 
time. Then I take my bike which 
you have chained to a tree after 
500 meters of riding and ride 
500 meters myself, and we keep 
alternating till we get to our 
destination.” 

Question is: what do they gain 
by this procedure? Or do they 
gain anything at all?

Giving Certain Powers the business for a change would be a joy

THE BUSINESS, 
AS USUAL 



By JACK SHARKEY 



I N 1962, the United States Air 
Force found itself possessed 
of a formidable tool of battle, 
a radar resistant airplane. While 
this was the occasion for much 
rejoicing among the Defense De- 
partment members who were 
cleared* for Top Secret, this na- 
tional-defense solution merely 
posed a greater problem: What 
should we do with it? 

“There must,” said the Secre- 
tary of Defense, “be some utili- 
zation of this new device to 
demonstrate to ‘Certain Powers’ 
that the world can be made safe

for Freedom and Democracy!” 

“ ‘Certain Powers,’ my foot,” 
said the President. “Why don’t 
we ever come out and just say 
it?” 

“Policy,” the Secretary said. 
“We’ve always walked softly in 
our Foreign Policy; especially 
softly in cases where we didn’t 
have the ‘big stick’ to carry.” 
“Well,” grumbled the Presi- 
dent, “we’ve got the big stick 
now. What do we do with it?” 
“We just want to shake it a 
bit,” said the Secretary. “No con- 
tusions intended, of course. We

just have to let them know we 
have it, but are too kind-hearted 
to use it. Unless provoked, nat- 
urally.” 

“I can see,” said the President, 
“that this new plane is burning 
a hole in your pocket. Suppose 
we do send it flying over Rus — ” 
“Mister President!” said the 
Secretary of Defense. 

The President sighed. “All 
right, all right. Flying over ‘Cer- 
tain Areas,’ then. Let’s say we get 
it there. Fine. What do we do 
with it? Drop leaflets?” 

“No. That comes under the 
proselytizing clause in the Ge- 
neva Conference of ’59.” 

“I don’t suppose a small — 
well, you know.” 

“Aggression,” said the Secre- 
tary. “We’d lose face in the Mid- 
dle East.” 

“So?” demanded the President, 
spreading his hands. “They don’t 
like us anyhow, do they? Or the 
competition — or each other, for 
that matter.” 

“That’s not the point. We have 
to feel as though our dollars are 
buying friends, whether or not 
it’s true.” 

“Well, then, what can we do?” 
said the President. “No leaflets, 
no aggression. We couldn’t maybe 
seed their clouds and make it 
rain on them?” 

“And get sued by other coun- 
tries for artificially creating low- 
pressure conditions that, they 



could claim, robbed them of 
their rightful rainfall? We’ve had 
it happen right here between our 
own states.” 

“Maybe we should just forget 
about it, then?” 

“Never! It must be demon- 
strated to the world that — ” 
“We could take a full-page ad 
in the New York Times." 

“It just isn’t done that way,” 
the Secretary protested. 

“Why not? It’d save money, 
wouldn’t it? A simple ad like, 
‘Hey, there, Certain Powers! 
Lookie what we got!’ What’d be 
wrong with that?” 

“They’d accuse us of Capital- 
istic Propaganda, that’s what! 
And to get the egg off our face, 
we’d have to demonstrate the 
plane and — ” 

“And be right back where we 
are now,” the President realized 
aloud, nodding gloomily. “Okay, 
so what do we do?” 

The Secretary looked to left 
and right, although they were 
alone together in a soundproofed, 
heavily guarded room, before re- 
plying. 

“We drop an agent!” he whis- 
pered. 

r ¥^HE President blinked twice 
■*- before responding. “Have you 
gone mad? What man in his 
right mind would volunteer for 
such a thing? ‘Drop an agent,’ 
indeed! Ten minutes after land-

ing, he’d be up against a wall and 
shot. Wouldn’t that be lovely for 
Freedom and Democracy? We’d 
have the R — the Certain Pow- 
ers gloating over the air waves 
for weeks about nipping a Capi- 
talist Assassination Plot in the 
bud, not to mention the Mothers 
of America beating down the 
White House door because one 
of Our Boys was sacrificed. You 
know how our country reacts: If 
an entire division is wiped out, 
we bite the bullet and erect stat- 
ues and make speeches and then 
forget it. But let a single man 
get in dutch and the whole popu- 
lace goes crazy until something 
is ‘done’ about it. No, it won’t 
work.” 

“May I finish?” said the Sec- 
retary patiently. 

The President shrugged. “Why 
not?” 

“This agent would be some- 
thing special, sir. One that would 
not only demonstrate our new 
aircraft, but which would posi- 
tively leave the R — damn, you’ve 
got me doing it! — Certain Pow- 
ers tied in knots. In point of fact, 
our military psychologists think 
that this agent might be the 
wedge to split Communism apart 
in hopeless panic!” 

“Really?” the President said, 
with more enthusiasm than he 
had shown throughout the entire 
meeting. “I’d like to meet this 
agent.” 



The Secretary pressed a black 
button upon the conference ta- 
ble. An instant later, the door 
opened and the Secretary’s per- 
sonal aide stepped in. “Yes, sir?” 
“Jenkins, have the corridor 
cleared and Secret Service men 
posted at all entrances and exits. 
When it’s safe, bring in Agent 
X-45.” He paused. “And Profes- 
sor Blake, too.” 

“At once, sir.” Jenkins hurried 
out. 

“X-45?” said the President. 
“Has he no name?” 

The Secretary smiled inscru- 
tably. “Teddy, sir.” 

“Why that smirk?” 

“You’ll see, sir.” 

They sat in fidgety silence for 
another minute, and then a buz- 
zer sounded, twice. 

“Ah, that’s Jenkins,” said the 
Secretary, and pressed the button 
once more. 

Jenkins came in, followed by 
a tall gray-haired man who car- 
ried a large black suitcase. The 
President arose, and, as Jenkins 
left the room again, shook hands 
with the man. “Agent X-45?” he 
asked. 

“Professor Charles Blake,” the 
man corrected him calmly. 
“Agent X-45 is in here.” 

The President stared. “In the 
suitcase? What are we sending? 
A dwarf?” 

“Hardly,” said the Secretary, 
snapping up the hasps on the

suitcase and opening it upon the 
table. “This,” he said, lifting some- 
thing from under tissue-paper 
padding, “is Agent X-45.” 

The President’s gaze was re- 
turned by two shiny black eyes, 
set on either side of a little brown 
muzzle with a gentle, stitched-on 
smile. Agent X-45 was clad in 
flight helmet, miniature jacket 
and tiny boots, with a baggy pair 
of brown canvas trousers belted 
at the waist with a bandolier 
holding a dozen small wooden 
bullets, and dangling a patent- 
leather holster containing a plas- 
tic water pistol. And he wore a 
small parachute and harness. 

“But that’s a teddy bear!” cried 
the President. 

“Precisely,” Professor Blake 
said. 

UT THINK I’ll sit down,” said 

A the President, and did so, 
visibly looking like a man who 
believes he is surrounded by lun- 
atics. 

“And look here!” said the Sec- 
retary, slipping his hand within 
Teddy’s jacket and withdrawing 
a small oilskin pouch. “It’s rather 
rudimentary, but the Cyrillic let- 
tering is genuine, and our am- 
bassador assures us the layout is 
correct.” 

The President took the pouch, 
unfolded it and drew out a small 
sheet of paper, covered with the 
inscrutable letterings, and num- 



erous rectangles and curving red 
lines. 

“I give up,” ' he said. “What is 
it?” 

“A map of the Kremlin,” said 
the Secretary, his eyes dancing. 
“That big red ‘X’ is the location 
of the Politburo Council Cham- 
ber.” 

“Perhaps,” the President said 
weakly, “you could explain . ?” 

“Mister President,” said Pro- 
fessor Blake, “I am the new 
Chief of Propaganda for the gov- 
ernment.” 

The President nodded, poured 
himself a glass of water from a 
pitcher and drained it. “Yes, yes?” 
he said. 

“Naturally, I have spent my 
career studying the psychology 
of a Certain Power . .” 

The President groaned. 
“Please, gentlemen, let’s name 
names! It need never go outside 
this room. My lips are sealed!” 

The professor and the Secre- 
tary exchanged a look, a raising 
of eyebrows, then a shrug of sur- 
render. 

“Very well,” said Blake. “Rus- 
sia — ” 

“There,” said the President. 
“That’s more like it.” 

Blake cleared his throat and 
went on. 

“We know the weak spot in 
the Russian armor is the mental- 
ity of the average Communist 
official,” he explained, while the

Secretary, who had heard this all 
before, fiddled with the straps of 
Teddy’s parachute and hummed 
softly to himself. “They have a 
distrust complex. Everything and 
everybody is under 24-hour-a-day 
suspicion.” 

“Yes, so I hear,” said the Pres- 
ident. 

“What do you suppose would 
happen to an agent that was 
caught by the Russians?” asked 
Blake. 

“I’d rather not even think 
about that.” 

“Not the sadistic details, sir. 
I mean the general train of 
events, from the time of capture 
onward.” 

The President pondered this. 
“After his capture,” he said 
thoughtfully, “he would be ques- 
tioned. Through various methods 
— hopelessly at variance with 
the regulations of the Geneva 
Convention — they would dis- 
cover his mission, and then he 
would be shot, I guess, or im- 
prisoned.” 

Blake nodded grimly. “And 
what if an agent landed there 
that could not divulge his mis- 
sion?” 

r T'HE Secretary stopped fiddling 
with the harness and watched 
the President’s face. On the worn 
features he read first puzzlement, 
then incredulity, then a flash of 
sheer amazement. 



“Good heavens!” said the Pres- 
ident. “They’d — they’d have to 
admit a defeat, I suppose . .” 
“But can they?” Blake leaned 
forward and slammed his fist 
upon the tabletop. “Can the Com- 
munist mentality ever admit that 
it’s been bested?” 

“I — I guess not. At least, they 
never do,” said the President 
“But this — ” he wagged a fore- 
finger at the stuffed thing on the 
table — “this certainly won’t up- 
set them. I mean, after all . 
He looked from one to th£ other 
for agreement and found none. 
“But, gentlemen, it’s nothing but 
a stuffed bear!” 

“It won’t upset them?” queried 
Blake slowly. “Are you sure?” 
“Of course I’m sure. They’ll 
find the bear, wherever it lands, 
and they’ll — well, they’ll know 
it’s a gag and just laugh at us.” 
“How will they know?” Blake 
persisted. 

“Well, they’ll be pretty well 
certain!” the President said scath- 
ingly: “I mean a stuffed toy — ” 
“Would they give up on some- 
thing of which they were ‘pretty 
well’ certain?” 

“They’d have to. Teddy, here, 
certainly couldn’t tell them any- 
thing. They’d say it was a joke 
and forget it . .” His voice barely 
sounded the last few words. He 
no longer believed them. A smile 
flickered upon his face. “Gentle- 
men, you don’t think they’d — ’’

“The Russians,” said Blake, 
without emotion, “would go off 
their rockers, sir. To be unable 
to explain a thing like this would 
devastate their morale. The Com- 
munist is a man who must hold 
all the aces. He’ll shuffle and re- 
shuffle until he gets them, too. 
Well, we’re giving him a cold 
deck, sir. There are no aces for 
him to find.” 

“Hmmm,” said the President. 
“As long as there’s any doubt in 
their minds, they’ll have to keep 
plugging at it, won’t they! And 
since there’s no solution — ” His 
smile grew calculating. “Yes, yes 
I begin to see. It’s a small thing, 
to be sure, but I find I must leap 
at the opportunity to stick a few 
ants in their pants for a change.” 

“It won’t wipe them out,” be- 
gan the Secretary. 

“But it’ll wear them down a 
little,” Blake finished. 

“Done!” said the President. 
“How soon can we get Operation 
Frustration under way?” 

“The plane is ready to leave 
right now,” said the Secretary, 
with a small blush. “I — I rather 
thought you’d see this thing our 
way.” 

The President frowned at this, 
then shrugged. “Good enough. 
Let’s get this bear into the air.” 

sure this plane will 
work?” asked the President, 
averting his face from the spray 



of leaves caught up in the shriek- 
ing jet stream of the waiting 
plane. 

“It’s too simple not to,” said 
Blake, clutching the suitcase — 
on whose side a large red “Top 
Secret” had been stenciled — to 
his chest, and shouting over the 
scream of the plane. “The radar- 
resistant device is nothing more 
than a radio-receiver that blank- 
ets the structure, making the en- 
tire plane a receiver. If it 
receives the radar impulses, they 
can’t bounce back and make a 
blip on the enemy radar screens.” 
The President sighed. “You 
make it sound almost too easy. 
Very well.” He shook the man’s 
hand. “Good luck.” 

“Thank you, sir,” said Blake, 
patting the suitcase. “I’ll take 
good care of Teddy.” 

The President nodded and 
moved away. Blake boarded the 
jet, and, minutes later, the Pres- 
ident was watching a last fading 
streamer of the twin exhausts 
dwindling upon the eastern hori- 
zon. 

“I shan’t sleep till he’s back,” 
said the Secretary. 

“Nor I,” said the President. “I 
have the weirdest damned ap- 
prehension . .” 

“About what, sir?” asked the 
Secretary, as they made their 
way from the field. 

“About the — ” the President 
looked around, then lowered his

voice to a whisper — “the Rus- 
sians. There’s something in their 
makeup we may have over- 
looked.” 

“Impossible, sir,” said the Sec- 
retary of Defense. “Blake is our 
top psychologist.” 

“I hope you’re right. If this 
fails, I’d hate for it to be traced 
to us.” 

“It can’t be. The jacket was 
made in Japan, the boots in Mex- 
ico, the parachute in — ” 

“I know, I know,” said the 
President. “But if they should 
trace it to us, we’ll be a laughing- 
stock.” 

“They won’t,” the Secretary 
assured him. 

'TWO days later, Blake was 
back, his manner jovial when 
he met in secret session once 
more with the two executives. 

“Couldn’t have gone more per- 
fectly, gentlemen,” he said, rub- 
bing his hands together and 
bouncing on his toes. “We passed 
directly over Moscow, at a height 
of ten miles, on the stroke of 
midnight. The night was over- 
cast and starless. Teddy was 
dropped through the bomb bay. 
I saw his parachute open myself. 
He’s down there now, and we’re 
sure to see signs any day now 
of the little cracks in the Iron 
Curtain.” 

“You had no trouble with the 
enemy?” the President asked, 



though the answer — since Blake 
was back alive — was obvious. 

“None,” Blake said. “The ra- 
dar shield performed exactly as 
specified, sir. Not a blink of a 
searchlight nor a single ground- 
to-air rocket did we see. Perhaps, 
on hearing us pass by, they sent 
up an investigating plane or two, 
but we were long gone by then. 
That’s the advantage of moving 
faster than the sound you make,” 
he added pontifically. 

“I still feel we’ve overlooked 
something,” said the President. 
“In the back of my mind, a small 
voice keeps trying to remind me 
of something about the Russians, 
something that should have 
made me veto this whole scheme 
at the start.” 

Blake looked puzzled. “What 
about them, sir? If it’s in regard 
to their psychology, I can assure 
you — ” 

“I don’t mean their psychology 
at all," said the President. “No, 
wait — yes, I do, in a minor 
way. They must pursue this thing, 
no matter what, but — ” 

A light glimmered, then 
burned brightly in the President’s 
eyes, and he stood up and 
smacked his fist into his open 
palm. “Of course!” he said. 
“Their methods!” 

“Methods?” asked Blake, a 
little nervously. 

The President’s reply was in- 
terrupted by a knock at the door.

The three men exchanged a look; 
then the Secretary jabbed the 
button, and Jenkins came in. 

“This just came for you, sir,” 
he said, handing the Secretary a 
small envelope, and making his 
exit silently. 

The President waited impa- 
tiently as the envelope was torn 
open and its contents read. Then 
the Secretary’s hands opened 
limply and the message fell upon 
the table. 

“Diplomatic note — Russian 
— Teddy,” he whispered. 

“What!” yelped the President. 
He snatched the paper from the 
table and read it, then sank into 



his chair once more, his face grim 
and eyes suspiciously moist. “The 
dirty, lowdown, rotten . .” 

Blake, hovering at tableside, 
hesitated a moment, then asked, 
“What about Teddy? What’s hap- 
pened?” 

“What we might have ex- 
pected,” said the Secretary dole- 
fully. 

“You don’t mean — ” Blake 
mumbled, horrified. He couldn’t 
continue, just waited for the 
worst. 

The President nodded miser- 
ably. 

“He’s confessed.”

I N a beer hall on the eighty- 
first floor of the Hotel Mark 
Twain fourteen men held an 
adolescent girl prisoner. 

“I’ll go up there by myself,” 
Sordman said. 

He was a big young man with 
sloppy black hair and a red beard. 
His fashionably ornate clothes cov- 
ered the body of a first class Tal- 
ent. Disciplined training, plus 
drugs and his natural gift, had 
made him one of the four truly 
developed psionic adepts in the 
world. With drugs and prepara- 
tion, he could command the entire 
range of psi powers. Without 
drugs, he could sense the emo- 
tions and sometimes the general 
thought patterns of the people 
near him. 

“We’d better go with you,” Lee 
Shawn said. “There’s an awful lot 
of fear up there. They’ll kill you 
as soon as they learn you’re a 
Talent.” 

She was a lean, handsome 
woman in her early forties. A 
lawyer-politician, she was the Gug- 
genheim Foundation’s lobbyist. 
For years she had fought against 
laws to outlaw the development 
of Talent. 

“Thanks, Mama, but I think I’d 
better go alone.” 

Sordman, though he didn’t tell 
her, knew that symbolically Lee 
saw him as the tree and herself as 
the rain and the earth.

“Go ahead and laugh,” George 
Aaron said. “But you’ll need big 
medicine to fight that fear. Lee’s 
symbolic place in your psyche is 
important.” 

“I’ve thought it over,” Sordman 
said. “I’ll depend on God and 
nothing else.” 

He felt George’s mind squirm. 
As a psychologist, George ac- 
cepted Sordman’s Zen-Christian 
faith because Sordman needed it 
to control the powers of his Tal- 
ent. 

But George himself was a con- 
firmed skeptic. 

The men up there were scared. 
Sordman knew he would die if he 
lost control. But Lee and George 
were scared, too. Even now, stand- 
ing in the park in early morning, 
their fear battered at his mind. 

He thought about swimming in 
the ocean. He made his skin re- 
member salted wind. The real At- 
lantic, a mile away, helped the 
illusion. 

It was the right symbol. He felt 
his friends calm. 

“Let him go,” George said. 

“He’s manipulating us,” Lee 
said. 

“I know. But let him go.”

He was the most powerful man in the world. 
He could make anybody do anything— and yet 
he was the slave of a mad criminal's mindl 



Sordman laughed. Lee bent and 
tore a clump of grass from the 
earth. “Take this, Andy.” 

“Thank you.” 

It was wet with dew. He held it 
to his nose and smelled the dirt 
and grass. Two things kept him 
from destruction by his own Tal- 
ent. He loved the physical world 
and he believed in God. 

“I’ll call you if I need you,” he 
said. 

“Be careful,” George said. 
“Many people need you.” 

“You’ve got status,” Lee said. 
“Use it. You’re dealing with the 
kind of people it impresses.” 

r T'HE hotel stood three hundred 
stories tall. Surrounded by a 
five-mile-square park, connected 
to the major coastal cities by high 
speed vacuum tubes, the building 
was a small town. Eighty-five 
thousand people lived within its 
walls. 

Sordman rode an empty ele- 
vator. Through the glass sides he 
studied the deserted halls and 
shops. 

They were frightened here. 
Murder had been done. A Talent 



had destroyed two men. Lord, 
protect us from the malice of a 
witch. 

The eighty-first was a commer- 
cial floor. He got off the vator 
and walked down the main corri- 
dor. A man watched him through 
the door of a bar. A girl in a blue 
kimono froze behind the counter 
of a pastry shop. 

He stopped before the doors of 
the beer hall. He dropped to his 
knees and prayed. 

Once the brave leader walked 
into a panicky group and it was 
enough to look calm. Now he had 
to be calm. It was not enough to 
square the shoulders, walk erect, 
speak in a confident tone. Sord- 
man’s true emotions radiated from 
him every moment. Those within 
range felt them as their own. 

He drove thoughts like knives 
into the deepest corners of his 
mind. He begged release from fear. 
He prayed his God to grant him 
love for the frightened men within. 

He stood erect and squared his 
shoulders. His bulb-shouldered 
morning coat was grey as dawn. 
He thought a well loved formula, 
a Buddhist prayer from the Book

of Universal Worship. All life is 
transitory. All people must suffer 
and die. Let us forgive one an- 
other. 

He roared his name and titles 
at the door. 

“I am Talent Andrew Sordman, 
Fellow for Life of the Guggenheim 
Foundation, by Senate Act Pro- 
tector of the People! By the laws 
of our country, I ask the right to 
enter.” 

Silence. 

“I am Talent Andrew Sordman, 
Fellow—” 

“Go away, witch!” 

Without drugs and preparation, 
Sordman needed visual contact to 
sense emotions. But he didn’t need 
Talent to sense the hatred in that 
voice. 

He pictured a rough block of 
stone. 

Using a basic skill, he kept 
the picture in his mind as he 
opened the door and planned his 
words. 

“I have taken no drugs and 
made no preparation. You have 
nothing to fear. I’m your Protector 
and I’ve come to talk.” 

r F'HE beer hall was large and 
gloomy. The butts and ashes 
of the night’s smoking filled its 
trays. Fourteen men watched him 
come. Half a dozen had hunting 
rifles. 

Hunched over, weeping, a thin, 
dark-haired girl sat beneath an 
84 



unshaded light. A shiver of anger 
crossed his brain. 

“Kill the witch!” a young man 
shouted. 

Lord, grant me love . 

His eyes focused on the rifle 
bearers. One of them half-raised 
his gun. Then the butt clumped on 
the floor. 

“You’re bewitched!” the young 
man said. “I told you not to let 
him in.” 

“I’ve come to talk,” Sordman 
said. “Who’s the leader of your 
group?” 

The young man said, “We don’t 
have a leader. Here we’re all 
equals.” 

Sordman studied the young 
man’s emotions. He was fright- 
ened, but only a little more than 
the others. There was something 
else there, too. Something very 
strong. Sex frustration! The young 
man had an athletic body and a 
handsome, chiselled face. On his 
yellow vest he wore the emblem 
of a Second Class Technician. But 
even a young man with adequate 
finances could be frustrated. Keep- 
ing the stone in his mind, he un- 
dressed a certain actress. 

He loved women and engaged 
in sex with lusty, triumphant joy. 
To him it was a celebration of the 
sacred mystery of life. He hoped 
some of this emotion reached its 
target. 

He started talking without ask- 
ing for a parley. 



GALAXY 



“Two men died yesterday. I’ve 
come to hunt out the murderer 
and put him away. What’s the evi- 
dence against this girl?” 

“We found drugs and a divining 
rod in her room.” 

“She’s had a reputation for a 
long time.” 

“The school kids say she’s a day- 
dreamer.” 

Sordman understood their fear. 
Psi was a new and dangerous force. 
Its use demanded moral and intel- 
lectual discipline. Only a rare and 
carefully developed personality 
could encounter the anger, hostil- 
ity and fear in other minds and 
still retain compassion and reason- 
able respect for human beings. An 
undisciplined person panicked and 
went into a mental state approach- 
ing paranoia. Sordman fought 
panic every day. He fought it with 
a total acceptance of human moti- 
vations, cultivated tenderness and 
compassion, and a healthy ego 
which could accept and enjoy its 
own self-love. 

Those things, Sordman would 
have said, and also the necessary 
grace of God. 

But the most undisciplined per- 
sonality could practice psi destruc- 
tively. Hostile minds roamed the 
world. Death could strike you in a 
clear field beneath an open sky 
while your murderer lay home in 
his bed. No wonder they dragged 
a girl from her parents and bullied 
her till dawn. 

SORDMAN THE PROTECTOR 



T HEY talked. Sordman picked 
his way through fourteen 
minds. As always, he found what 
he wanted. 

A fat, redheaded man sat a little 
apart from the group. He radiated 
a special kind of concern. He was 
concerned for the girl and for his 
own children. He believed the ac- 
tions of the night had been neces- 
sary, but he felt the girl’s pain and 
he wasn’t sure he was doing the 
right thing. 

Above all, he was a man who 
wanted to do the right thing — the 
really right thing. 

“You all have children,” Sord- 
man said. “Would you like to see 
them dragged out at night and 
treated the way you’ve treated 
this girl?” 

“We’ve got to protect ourselves!” 
the young man said. 

“Let him talk!” the fat man 
growled. He stared at the thick 
hands he spread on the table. “The 
girl has said all night she’s inno- 
cent. Maybe she is. Maybe the Pro- 
tector can do what we haven’t 
done and find the real killer.” 

“I’m a master Talent,” Sord- 
man said. “If the killer is in the 
hotel, I can track him down before 
midnight. Will you give me that 
long?” 

“How do we know you’ll bring 
in the right man?” 

“If he’s the right man, he’ll make 
it plain enough.” 

“You’ll make him confess,” the 
85 



young man said. “You’ll manipu- 
late him like a puppet.” 

“What good will that do?” Sord- 
man said. “Do you think I could 
control a man all the time he’s in 
prison and on trial? If I use my 
Talent more than a few hours, I 
collapse.” 

“Can we hold the girl here?” 
asked the redheaded fat man. 

“Feed her and treat her right,” 
Sordman said. “What’s your 
name?” 

“John Dyer. My friends were 
about to use their belts on her.” 

A rifleman shuffled uneasily. “It’s 
the only way. Mind killers use 
their Talent to tie their tongues 
and confuse us. Only pain can 
break their control.” 

“That’s a fairy tale,” Sordman 
said. “Without drugs a Talent is 
helpless.” 

“We’ve got the girl,” John 
Dyer said. “She can’t hurt us while 
we’re waiting.” 

“He can!” the young man 
screamed. “Are you a plain fool? 
He can go outside and kill us all.” 

Sordman laughed. “Sure I 
could. And tomorrow I’d have to 
fight off an army. That I couldn’t 
do if I was fool enough to try. 
You’re frightened, boy. Use your 
head.” 

“You are excited, Leonard,” 
said an armed man. He wore a 
blue morning coat with Manager’s 
stars and the emblem of a trans- 
portation company. “We can wait 



a day. If we’ve got the killer, then 
we’re safe. If we don’t, then we’ve 
failed and the Protector should 
try.” 

“I’m not frightened. I just don’t 
like Talent.” 

Most of the men frowned. They 
didn’t share the prejudice. A few 
nodded and mumbled and shot 
dark glances at Sordman. 

He let them talk. He stood there 
and thought apple pies and the 
brotherhood of man and the time 
he and his second wife spent three 
days in bed. And the big block of 
stone. 

He was a high-powered trans- 
mitter broadcasting joy, good will 
toward men and tranquility. 

In the end they listened to Dyer. 

“But don’t think you’ll get a 
minute past midnight,” said the 
young man. 

“Technician, your Protector will 
remember.” 

LARKE ESPONITO had 
^ been a hard, quick little man 
in his early fifties. On the day of 
his death, the hotel newspaper had 
published his picture and an- 
nounced his promotion to Direc- 
tor of Vocational Testing for the 
entire Atlantic Region. He had 
lived with his wife and his nine- 
teen-year-old son, and his wife had 
been a lifetime wife. Esponito had 
been a Catholic, and that faith still 
called short-term marriages a mor- 
tal sin.

For a moment Sordman won- 
dered what it would be like to know 
only one woman your entire life. 
He loved the infinite variety of 
God’s creation and wanted to sam- 
ple as much of it as he could. 

“My lady Widow, our apologies.” 
Lee bowed, hands before her chest, 
and Sordman and George Aaron 
bowed with her. “We intrude on 
you,” Lee said, “only because we 
have to find the real killer. Other 
people may be in danger.” 

The Widow Esponito bowed in 
return. 

“I understand, Politician

Even with her face scarred by 
tears she looked lovely. From the 
earliest years of their marriage, her 
husband had been high in the Civil 
Service and able to buy her beauty 
treatments. 

“Mylady,” Sordman said, “I 
need your help for two things. We 
want to know who you think 
wanted to kill your husband. And 
we need your want.” 

“Our want?” her son asked. He 
stood rigidly beside his mother’s 
chair. His clothes were rich and 
formal tweed. 

“Do you want to find the killer?” 

The boy nodded soberly. “The 
moment I heard of his murder, I 
promised to avenge him.” 

“John!” His mother trembled. 
“You were raised to be a Chris- 
tian!” 

Sordman said, “I want to locate 
SORDMAN THE PROTECTOR 



the image I think was used to kill 
him. For that I want to hook your 
strong desires into my thoughts. 
You won’t know I’m doing it. But 
if you’re near me, I’ll use your 
emotions.” 

“Your husband was a very im- 
portant man,” Lee said. “Would 
anyone gain by his death?” 

“Everyone liked my husband. 
He was always laughing, he—” The 
old-young woman started crying. 
Her son put his arm around her 
shoulders. 

CORDMAN felt her pain and 
^ winced. Death and pain were 
part of Creation, but he hated them 
and often cursed them. At times 
like these, he understood George’s 
skepticism. 

The boy said, “Manager Kurt 
didn’t like him.” 

Mylady stifled her sobs and sat 
up. “Manager Kurt has been our 
guest every month. Protector, 
John’s upset. He’s talking wildly.” 
“Father told me. He said Man- 
ager Kurt didn’t like him.” 

“Your father and the Manager 
were good friends.” 

He felt a sudden resentment in 
the woman. Why? The boy didn’t 
feel as if he was lying. Maybe Es- 
ponito had been the kind of man 
who didn’t talk about his job with 
his wife. But his son — who would 
some day be a member of his 
father’s class— would have received 
a certain amount of practical ad- 



87 



vice. Perhaps Mylady resented be- 
ing left out of her husband’s pro- 
fessional life. That was a common 
family pattern, after all. 

George felt impatient. Sordman 
shot him a questioning glance. 
“Where does Manager Kurt live?” 
“In Baltimore,” the boy said. 
“Mylady, may we use your 
phone?” 

“You don’t take John seriously?” 
Mylady said. 

“We’ll have to ask the Baltimore 
police to check on the Manager. 
It may not mean anything, but we 
have to follow every lead.” 

“Use the phone, Protector.” 
Sordman and George stepped 
into the dining room. 

“We’re wasting time,” George 
said. “They’re both upset and there 
seems to be a family quarrel.” 

“I know. But Esponito’s murder 
gives us more leads than Bedler’s. 
Bedler didn’t even have a one- 
month wife when he died. Lots of 
people knew the Administrator and 
might have had a grudge against 
him.” 

George clasped his hands behind 
his back. “We’ve unraveled twen- 
ty-three murders in the last four 
years. Judging by that experience, 
I’d say there are three possibilities: 
both victims were picked at ran- 
dom; both victims are in some way 
related; or one victim was killed to 
confuse the police.” 

“Unless we have something en- 
tirely new.” 



“That’s been the pattern so far.” 
“I think we’re both coming to 
the same conclusion.” 

“Find out if the murderer used 
the picture from the paper?” 

“Mmm. If he did, Administrator 
Esponito was probably attacked on 
the spur of the moment And we 
should be seeing who wanted to kill 
Bedler.” 

“What about Manager Kurt?” 
“Have Lee call the Baltimore 
police while I try to locate the mur- 
der weapon. At least they can 
search his home for drugs.” 

EORGE went back to the par- 
lor and Sordman stripped to 
his yellow vest. From the pockets 
of his morning coat he removed a 
leather case and a tiny plastic 
package. Unfolded, the plastic be- 
came a thin red robe with a yellow 
bomb-burst on the back. 

He called it his battle robe. 
Habit played a big part in the de- 
velopment of Talent. The same 
clothing, the same ritualized move- 
ments, helped put his mind in the 
proper state. 

He filled a hypodermic with a 
pink liquid and jabbed the needle 
into his wrist. As the drug took ef- 
fect, he knelt to pray. 

“Grant me, God, the strength to 
bind the demons in my mind.” 

He stood up. At this point many 
Talents danced. Sordman loved to 
use his body, but ritual dancing 
made him feel ridiculous. It had 



88 



GALAXY 



been proven, however, that the 
Power flowed at its freest when the 
body was occupied, so he took three 
colored balls from the case and 
started juggling. 

The balls soared higher and fas- 
ter. He mumbled a hymn. His voice 
grew stronger. He roared his love 
of life at the world. 

The wall between his conscious 
and unconscious mind collapsed. 
Lightning flashed in his eyes. 
Colors sang in his brain. Walls, 
floor, table, chairs became exten- 
sions of his mind. They danced 
with the balls between his hands. 
The Universe and he flowed to- 
gether like a sea of molten iron. 

His hands, miles from his mind, 
fumbled in the case. The balls 
danced and bobbed in the air. He 
laughed and unfolded his divining 
rod. The furniture bounced. My- 
lady Esponito screamed. 

All Creation is a flow. Dance, you 
parts of me, you living things, you 
atoms of my dust! 

He had torn Esponito’s photo 
from a newspaper. Now he let the 
colored balls drop and stuck the 
picture on the end of the rod. 

“This and that are one in kind. 
Servant rod, find me that!” 

He stretched out the rod and 
turned on his heels. He sang and 
blanked his mind and listened to 
the tremors in his hands. 

Stop. Back right. Now the left. 
Too far. Down. Correct left . 

Here! 



He pressed a button on the rod. 
A tripod sprang out. A pair of sights 
flipped up. Carefully he sighted 
down the rod, out through the win- 
dow-wall beside the table, to a 
grove of trees in the park. 

Z'"' 1 REATION roaring in his open 
^ head, divining rod in hand, he 
stormed out the door and down 
the hall. Lee and George hurried 
after him. The presence of their 
well known minds pleased him. 
There was George’s unexpressed 
belief that he had “mastered” and 
guided the Power he feared. There 
was Lee’s worry for him and her 
keen awareness of human realities. 
And there, too, were self-discipline, 
intelligence, affection, and a rich- 
ness of experience and thought he 
expected to draw on for another 
forty years. 

And filling the world, pounding 
on the walls of existence, the 
Power. His power. He, the master 
of the world! He who could uproot 
the trees, spin the earth, make the 
ground shake and change the colors 
of the sky. 

He felt George’s clear-eyed, 
good-humored tolerance. A hyp- 
notic command triggered in his 
mind. He saw a Roman Caesar ride 
in triumph and the slave behind 
him said, “Caesar, remember you 
are mortal.” 

My power? It is a gift from the 
Fountain of Creation. Mine to use 
with the wisdom and restraint im- 



90 



GALAXY 



planted by my teachers. Or else 
I’ll be destroyed by my power. 

He laughed and rolled into a 
cannon ball and hurled his body 
through the wood. 

“Andy! Andy, you’re losing us!” 
He picked them up and towed 
them with him. The girl in the 
beer hall cried in his heart. The 
fox is many hills away and the 
hound grows impatient. 

They landed in a heap. 

George said, “Andy, what the 
hell are you doing?” 

“I brought you down in a soft 
spot.” 

“You felt like an elephant run- 
ning amok! Boy, you’ve got to be 
careful. Since you were a little boy 
I’ve taught you to watch every 
move. For a moment I don’t think 
you knew how you felt.” 

“You’re right,” Sordman mum- 
bled. “That was close.” 

“Let’s find the picture,” Lee said. 
“Has the drug worn off?” 

“Just about. The picture’s over 
by that tree. It feels like it’s rum- 
pled up.” 

After a minute’s hunt, they found 
it. It had been rolled into a ball 
and tossed away. 

“We’re dealing with an ama- 
teur,” Lee said. “A Talent who was 
even half-developed would have 
burned this.” 

Unrolled, the picture fell in half. 
It had been sliced with a blade. 

“Let’s walk back,” Sordman said. 
“Let’s talk.” 



They crossed a log bridge. He 
ran his hands along the rough bark 
and smelled the cool water of the 
stream. Most of the big park was 
wilderness, but here and there were 
pavilions, an outdoor theatre, open 
playing fields and beautifully 
planned gardens. A man could have 
a home surrounded by the shops 
and pleasures of civilized living 
and yet only be a ten-minute ele- 
vator ride from God’s bounty. 

“The fact the killer used the 
newspaper picture doesn’t prove 
Bedler was the real victim,” George 
said. “But it indicates it.” 

“Let’s assume it’s true,” Sordman 
said, “and see where it leads us.” 

“Bedler was married,” Lee said. 
“I remember that from our brief- 
ing.” 

Sordman rabbit-punched a tree 
as he passed it. “It was a one-year 
contract, and it ended two weeks 
ago.” 

“I smell jealousy,” Lee said. 

“The world is filled with it,” 
George said. “I favor short-term 
marriages. They’re the only way a 
person can practice a difficult art 
and make mistakes without com- 
mitting himself for life. But about 
half the mental breakdowns I used 
to get were due to the insecurities 
caused by a temporary contract. 
One party almost always hopes the 
marriage will somehow become 
permanent.” 

“Let’s talk to Bedler’s ex-wife,” 
Sordman said. 



SORDMAN THE PROTECTOR 



91 



TTER name was Jackie Baker. 

She was just over five feet tall 
and blonde. She wore glasses with 
green frames. 

Sordman liked big women but he 
had to admit this little creature 
made him feel like swatting and 
rubbing. 

She wore a sea-green kimono 
and bowed gracefully at the door. 

“Citizen Baker, I’m Protector 
Andrew Sordman. May we talk to 
you?” 

“Certainly, Protector. Welcome.” 

They entered and he introduced 
Lee and George. After they ex- 
changed bows, the girl offered them 
some wine. She took a bottle of 
clear Rhine wine from the cooler 
and asked George to open it. There 
were several journals on a throw 
table. 

“Are you a doctor, Citizen?” Lee 
asked. 

“No, Politician. A medical tech- 
nician.” 

They drank the first glass of 
wine. 

“Technician,” George said, “we 
have to ask you some questions. 
We’ll try not to upset you.” 

The girl closed her eyes. “I’ll try 
not to be upset. I hope you find 
whoever killed him. I’d like to find 
her.” 

The girl felt lonely. She ached 
with unsatisfied needs. I’d like to lie 
with you and comfort you, Sord- 
man thought. I’d like to hold you 
in my arms and drain all the tears 



you’re holding back. But he 
couldn’t. His contract with his wife 
had six months to run and no one 
committed adultery any more. 
“When the rules are carefully tail- 
ored to human needs,” Lee often 
said, “there’s no excuse for break- 
ing them.” 

“Why ‘her’?” Lee asked. “Why 
‘her’ instead of ‘him’?” 

The girl looked at Sordman. 
“Can’t you just probe my mind? Do 
I have to answer questions?” 

“I’m afraid so,” Sordman said. 
“My Talent has its limits. I can’t 
deep-probe everybody’s mind, any 
more than a baseball pitcher can 
pitch all day.” 

Lee said, “Even if he could, our 
warrant says we can’t probe more 
than four suspects.” 

“Now can you tell us why you 
think the killer is a woman?” 
George asked. 

r T , HE girl held out her glass and 
George filled it. “Because he 
was the kind of man who made you 
want to kill him. He was under- 
standing and loving. He made me 
feel like a princess all the time I 
lived with him. But he can’t keep 
to one girl.” She gulped down the 
whole glass. “He told me so him- 
self. He was so wonderful to live 
with I went insane every time he 
looked at another girl. I knew he 
was shopping for his next wife.” 
She wiggled in her chair. “Is that 
what you want to know?” 



92 



GALAXY 



“I’m sorry,” Sordman said. “Do 
you know who he was interested in 
before he died?” 

The girl had big, myopic eyes. 
“Our contract ended sixteen days 
ago.” She took a cigarette from in- 
side her kimono. “Protector Sord- 
man, could I just talk to you?” 
“Certainly,” Sordman said. 

Lee and George went to a coffee 
house on the next floor down. 

“I want to talk to just you,” the 
girl said. “I feel safe with you. You 
make me feel right.” 

“It goes with being a Talent,” 
Sordman said. “Either we like 
people and let them know it or we 
crack.” 

“I know it’s all right to tell you 
things. I love Joe. I broke the rules 
for him. I didn’t avoid him for three 
months the way you’re supposed 
to. I went everywhere I knew he’d 
be. I had to see him.” 

Sordman stroked his beard. 
Mentally, he cuddled her in his 
arms and murmured comfort to 
her. 

She hunched her shoulders 
and wrapped her arms around her 
body. 

“Just before our marriage ended, 
I found out he was seeing Raven 
English as much as he could. He 
didn’t break the rules. But when 
we went to dances he always 
danced with her once or twice. And 
she and her husband used to meet 
us in bars. After the contract ex- 
pired, he couldn’t see her much be- 



cause she and her husband have 
another six months to go. But there 
was a dance last week and I saw 
the two of them disappear into the 
park. Raven’s husband hunted all 
over for her. He looked horrible. I 
pitied him.” 

“Who’s Raven English?” 

“She’s a sadist. I know she is. 
She’s just the type to do this. She 
likes to play with men and hurt 
them. Her poor husband is a nerv- 
ous wreck. I know she killed Joe, 
Protector. She hates us!” 

He stood up. The girl watched 
him with big eyes. He put his hand 
on her head. 

“Sleep is a joy,” he said. 

Unprepared, he couldn’t have 
done that to many people. But she 
was a woman, which added to his 
influence, and totally exhausted. 

TT E got off the vator and looked 
around for the coffee house. 
Dozens of people wandered the 
halls and the shops. As he walked 
down the hall, some of them looked 
away or got as far from him as they 
could. Others ignored him or found 
his presence reassuring or studied 
him curiously. 

A fat woman in a black kimono 
walked toward him. She had one 
hand on her hip and her eyes were 
narrowed and hard. Sordman 
smiled. He felt her fear and dis- 
trust, and her determination not to 
let such emotions conquer her. 

“Good afternoon, Protector.” 



SORDMAN THE PROTECTOR 



93 



“Good afternoon, Citizen 
Mother.” 

He felt her triumph and her 
pleasure with herself. 

His fellow humans often made 
him gawk in wonder. Some people 
say we’re psychic cripples, he 
thought. And maybe we are. But 
we do our work and we enjoy our- 
selves. And we do dangerous things 
like putting bases on Venus and 
falling in love. Surrounded by 
death and danger, crippled though 
we are, we go on. 

He swelled with feeling. People 
smiled and glanced at each other 
or hid shyly from the organ chords 
of his emotion. 

An old man stepped in front of 
him. 

“Monster! Freak!” 

He was thin and perfectly 
dressed. Sordman stopped. God of 
Infinite Compassion, this is my 
brother . 

“They ought to lock you up,” the 
man said. “They ought to keep you 
away from decent people. Get out 
of my head! Leave me alone!” 

People stared at them. A small 
crowd gathered. Lee appeared in 
the door of the coffee house. 

“It’s all right,” Sordman told the 
people. “It’s all right.” He started 
to go on. 

The man stepped in front of him. 
“Leave me alone, freak. Let me 
think my own thoughts!” 

“Citizen, I haven’t touched your 
mind.” 



“I felt it just then!” 

“It was no more than I could 
help. I’m sorry if I’ve hurt you.” 
“Go away!” 

“I’m trying to.” 

“Murderer! Mind witch!” 

He was faced with a strong mind 
that valued its independence. Any- 
thing he did would be detected and 
resented. 

“Citizens,” he said, “this man de- 
serves your respect. No matter 
what a man does, he’s bound to 
offend someone. This Citizen 
values his privacy — which is good 
— and therefore I make him angry. 
I hope the good my Talent lets me 
do outweighs the bad. Forgive me, 
brother.” 

He stepped to one side. “Leave 
him alone,” someone said. “Let the 
Protector work.” 

“Leave him alone, old man.” 
“I'm not an old man ” 

“No, you’re not,” Sordman said. 
“I admire your courage.” He 
walked on. Behind him the old man 
shouted curses. 

“Are you all right?” Lee said. 
“Sure. Let’s go in and sit down.” 
There were just a few people in 
the coffee house. Sordman ordered 
and told them what he had learned. 

“I wish you could probe every- 
one in the building,” George said. 
“All we get is gossip.” 

“The husband of this Raven 
English has a motive,” Lee said. 
“Why don’t we visit her?” 

“I think we should.” Sordman 



94 



GALAXY 



drank his coffee. “Citizen English 
herself might have killed them.” 

“I doubt it,” George said. 

“It all sounds like a lot of talk,” 
Sordman said. “But we have to fol- 
low it up. This business is nothing 
but wearing out your legs running 
after every lead. If your legs are 
strong, you can run anybody down.” 
They finished their coffee and 
cigarettes and trudged out. 

T>AVEN English, one-year wife 
of Leonard Smith, did not 
meet them at the door with gracious 
bows. Instead, a wall panel by the 
door shot back. They stared at a 
square of one way glass. 

“Who are you?” a girl’s voice 
said. 

“I’m Andrew Sordman, your 
Protector. I come on lawful busi- 
ness. May we enter?” 

“No.” 

“Why not?” Lee asked. 

“Because I don’t like witches. 
Keep out.” 

“We’re hunting the killer,” Sord- 
man said. “We’re on your side. I’ve 
taken no drugs and made no prepa- 
rations. You don’t have to be 
afraid.” 

“I’m not afraid. I just don’t want 
you in my home.” 

“You have to let us in,” Lee said. 
“Our warrant gives us entry into 
every room in this hotel. If we have 
to break the door down, we can.” 

“I hope we don’t have to break 
the door down.” 



“You’re getting fat,” George said. 
“You need the exercise.” 

“You won’t break in,” the girl 
said. 

Sordman crossed the hall to get 
a good start. “I’m about to, My- 
lady.” His shoulder filled the door- 
way behind him. This looks like 
fun, he thought. He liked to feel his 
body working. 

The door opened. A dark-haired, 
slender girl stood in the doorway. 
Her skin was brown and her lips 
were pink, unpainted flesh. She 
wore a red kimono. 

“All right. Come in.” 

“Gladly,” Sordman said. 

It was a three-room apartment, 
with the kitchen tucked into one 
wall of the parlor. A painting stood 
on an easel by the window. The 
window was a shoulder-high slit 
and from it, here on the hundred 
and forty-first floor, he could see 
across the park to the beach and 
the rolling Atlantic. 

God grant me self-control, he 
thought. If this is the killer, grant 
me self-control. He made his sav- 
age thoughts lie down and purred 
at the world. 

“I’m sorry we have to force our 
way in,” he said. “And I’m sorry 
you don’t approve of Talent. But 
please remember two men have 
died and a little girl may die, too. 
There are lots of panicky people 
in the Mark Twain. We’ve got to 
find the killer soon and you can 
help us.” 



SORDMAN THE PROTECTOR

“Why bother me?” the girl said. 
“This is awkward,” Lee said. She 
stood erect but looked past the girl. 
She felt embarrassed. “Someone 
told us you and Bedler were seeing 
each other.” 

“Oh, quit being prudish,” George 
said. “These things happen all the 
time.” He turned to the girl. “We 
were told you and Joe Bedler were 
making plans to get married when 
your present contract ends.” 
“That’s a lie!” 

Sordman laughed in his belly. 
No matter what the rules were, 
few women publicly admitted they 
had broken them. By the standards 
of the period from 1800 to 1990, 
the whole marriage system of the 
Twenty-First Century was im- 
moral; but there were still prudes. 
And women still preserved the 
conventions. 

“Who told you that?” Raven 
English said. She frowned. “Was 
it that Jackie Baker?” 

“Why her?” George asked. 
“Because she’s a logical person 
for you to talk to and because it’s 
the kind of thing she’d say.” 

“Yes,” Sordman said. 

“She ought to see a psycher! 
And that’s why you came?” 

“We’re not accusing you,” Sord- 
man said. “But we’ve got to follow 
every lead.” 

r I ^ HE girl swore. “Why would I 
kill Joe? Why are you all sus- 
picious? That’s why I hate Talents! 



All you’ve done is make everyone 
suspicious. Everybody’s afraid of 
everybody else.” 

“Are you an artist?” Sordman 
asked. 

“What?” 

“Are you an artist?” 

“What’s that got to do with it? 
No, I’m not. My husband paints.” 
He felt her stall and evade. She 
would grab at any subject to dis- 
tract them. He decided he would 
let his mind probe at random. 

“Is he a professional painter?” 
Lee asked. 

“No, he’s an engineer. They 
wouldn’t let him go to art school. 
He’s trying to teach himself.” She 
shrugged and ogled the ceiling. 

Her emotions said, Men are like 
that. 

“What does your husband think 
of Talent?” Sordman asked. “Does 
he share your prejudice?” 

“Didn’t you meet Len?” 
“Where?” He stroked his beard. 
“Is he the Len downstairs in the 
beer hall?” 

“Of course!” 

“I’m afraid I didn’t make the 
connection.” 

He felt two other minds run like 
hounds down the same trail. 

Lee studied the painting. “Why 
does your husband hate Talent?” 
“Is this a survey?” 

Lee grinned. “I’m the lobbyist 
for the Guggenheim Foundation. 
Asking that kind of question is a 
reflex.”

GALAXY 



The girl walked around the 
room. She looked out the window 
and stretched. Sordman bellowed 
lust at her flanks and the long curve 
of her hips. 

“Why do men do anything?” 
Raven yawned. “When he was in 
Voc school some kid took him in 
the back room and showed him 
some tricks. Maybe that did it. Is 
there a psycher in the house?” 

“There is,” George said. “Is Citi- 
zen Smith an astronautical engi- 
neer?” 

“You could say so. He works on 
instruments for space labs.” 

“That’s funny.” George stared 
at the sun flashing on the far-off 
ocean. “I remember I felt bitter 
once because I couldn’t be a space 
engineer. I wanted to build rockets 
and ride to the planets. But the 
Voc people told me I was too weak 
in math. So I became a healer of 
the psyche and I learned my love 
for rockets was a hunger for power. 
But still I love the brutes and now 
I’m an old man I still sometimes 
wish I’d been an engineer.” 

“That’s too bad,” the girl said 
politely. 

“Yes. I suppose your husband 
feels that way about art?” 

“He gets drunk about it some- 
times.” 

“Double motive!” Sordman said. 

“One conscious,” George said, 
“plain jealousy. The other half- 
conscious — resentment. Nobody 
kills at random. There’s always a 



reason why he took these lives in- 
stead of others.” 

“Plus a lot of self-pity,” Lee said, 
“and I think his wife despises him.” 

“What are you talking about?” 
Raven said. “What did you say 
about me?” 

“We think we’ve got a suspect,” 
Sordman said. 

“I didn’t do it!” 

“I’m going to probe your hus- 
band.” 

“My husband hates Talent.” 

“We have to hurry,” Sordman 
said. “If your husband’s innocent, 
I’m sorry. We’re not saying he’s 
guilty. But I have to examine him.” 

At the door he paused and 
thought, God of Infinite Compas- 
sion . The girl sat down and 
stared at the wall. 

[V| ANY drugs activate the psi 
powers. The commonest, 
available in any drug store, is a 
pill of codeine and half a dried 
peyote bean. Leonard Smith had 
both in his pocket when he ran out 
the side door of the beer hall. 

Sordman swore wildly. The girl 
screamed. The men, the hunters 
of witches and killers, either froze 
or shouted and ran to the door. 
Only John Dyer and two others 
ran shouting down the hall. 

Sordman ran to the door and 
saw Smith leap into the elevator. 
He grabbed a wall phone and 
dialed the Manager’s office. 

“We’ve got the killer,” he

shouted. “His name’s Leonard 
Smith. He’s a young man, dark, 
wiry, good looking, and he’s on the 
elevator going down.” 

“We’ll get him!” 

“Leave him alone! I saw him 
swallow something as he left. I 
think he’s drugged. Clear the lobby 
but watch him from hiding. I’ll get 
him before he goes far.” 

John Dyer trudged back to the 
beer hall. “Give me your rifle,” he 
told an armed man. Before the 
man could say anything Dyer 
snatched the rifle from him. 

“All right,” Dyer said. “Who’s 
going with me?” 

“Hold on,” Sordman said. 
“Where are you going?” 

“After Smith.” 

“I’m going after him. Let him 
go and I’ll have him out cold be- 
fore an hour’s up.” 

“There isn’t anything a rifle 
can’t stop.” 

Sordman understood. These 
men were afraid of Talent. But 
some, like Dyer, had to fight that 
fear. They had to prove that in- 
telligence and the technical power 
organized society gives individual 
men were superior to Talent. 

“I can’t stop you,” Sordman 
said. “But listen to me. Smith has 
to be captured alive. The man is 
insane. He’s no more a villain than 
you or me. He just tampered with 
a force he couldn’t control. You 
might stop him with a bullet but 
you’ll have to kill him to do it.”

“He killed two of us,” a man 
said. 

“He’s drugged. He can hide and 
kill you from a distance.” 

“So can we,” Dyer said. “That’s 
what we do with rifles.” 

Sordman ran his fingers through 
his hair. “Stay under cover then. 
And if I get him pacified, let him 
live.” 

HP HE wall phone buzzed. 

“Sordman.” 

“This is the Manager. He stole 
a hatchet in the leisure store. He’s 
out in the park.” 

“Did anybody try to stop him?” 
“I cleared the place out.” 

“Some of your tenants are going 
after him. Don’t let anybody else 
join them. I wish myself they 
wouldn’t go.” 

After he hung up the three of 
them went up a floor and rang the 
buzzer of a one-tenant apartment 
As politely as they could, Lee and 
George bundled the occupant out. 

“I wish you’d let the state police 
capture him,” George said. 

“I’ve got to get to him before 
they kill him,” Sordman said. 

“Andy, there are limits to what 
you can take! Smith has gone ber- 
serk. You connect with an insane 
man and you may shatter all over 
the place.” 

Sordman stroked his beard. 

“Let him go,” Lee said. “Can’t 
you feel he has to do this?” 

“Yes, but I won’t admit it. I

trained you, Andy. You're my life's 
work. I don’t want you to wreck 
yourself.” 

Sordman nodded soberly. “I 
know, George. I’ll take care of my- 
self.” He thought tender thoughts 
and tried to make them feel how 
much he loved them. 

“Let’s go,” Lee mumbled. “Come 
on, George.” 

He closed the door gently. The 
window of the apartment over- 
looked the park. He stared at the 
thick trees and wondered where 
Smith was running under that 
green roof. Then he turned to the 
picture phone and punched out a 
number. 

The screen lit. It was in full 
color, praise God. 

“Andy!” 

His wife smiled when she saw 
him. She was a big girl with long 
breasts and full thighs. She wore 
a dark kimono. 

She bowed. “Good afternoon, 
Husband.” 

“Good afternoon, Wife.” He 
pressed his palms together and re- 
turned the bow. 

“Why are you calling, Andy?” 

“BecauseT love you. And I want 
to ask you a favor, Tina.” 

“What, Husband?” 

“Will you undress for me now?” 

“Andy! My, my, my.” 

He explained the situation to 
her. “Be careful,” she said. “I love 
you.” 

“I’ll be careful. But I’ve got to 



be aware of myself as a physical 
being. You understand.” 

She smiled. “May I take my 
time?” 

“Not too long.” 

She was an uninhibited girl and 
took great pleasure in displaying 
herself. Her skin was pure white 
and her stomach smooth and softly 
rounded. He could feel the weight 
of her breasts on his palm. 

“God is good,” he said. 

“Thank you.” 

His glands flooded his body. His 
body ached to stroke, squeeze, kiss, 
penetrate. 

“You’d better go,” he said. “Be- 
fore I break the screen down.” 

She bowed. “Live with God, 
Husband.” 

“Live with God, Wife.” 

nPHE screen faded. He put on 

his robe and jabbed the hypo- 
dermic into his wrist. Then he 
knelt to pray. 

He did not pray for power. In- 
telligence and hard work could 
give him that. He prayed for 
mercy, compassion, recognition of 
his own flawed nature. He prayed 
for courage and the end of fear. 

The balls danced between his 
hands. He sang the Song of Praise, 
the love song to the world. Gloria 
mundi. Glory in the world, glory 
in the flesh, glory in the flow of 
life. Creation is a flow and man a 
bubble bouncing on the flow. Bub- 
ble that will burst but bubble that 



100 



GALAXY 



is. Bubble that feels, strives, blends 
with other bubbles. 

Bubble that can fill Creation! 

He roared at the walls of exist- 
ence. His mind yawned and 
stretched and came awake. He 
prowled across the woods and 
parks. Gigantic, he gazed at the 
mortals who stumbled through the 
shaded tunnels of the world. These 
are such as me. These share my 
doomed existence. 

And that one? That one lying 
in the brush with an axe? That 
one, preparing to kill, clawing 
since he was a baby at a world that 
torments him? 

That also is me. 

Smith rose to his knees and 
swung the axe. John Dyer crum- 
pled with a severed spine. The axe 
swung twice and two men fell. The 
hunters dropped to their bellies. 
Rifles cracked. Bullets sang in the 
grass. 

Now they knew they had to kill 
Smith or die. Now they felt no 
mercy. 

Sordman hovered over them. 
What he feels, I will feel. His hate 
will be my hate. His anger mine. 
His hate must be absorbed in great 
compassion, in tenderness and ra- 
tionality. Or I will be destroyed 
with him. 

In the room the balls spun and 
whirled. He lay prostrate on the 
floor, the yellow bomb-burst on his 
back. He was afraid. His weakness 
was naked. He had always known 



he would someday meet a person- 
ality he could not forgive. When 
that day came he would shatter 
and flee, like Smith, to any refuge 
he could make. 

“Show your heads! Show your 
heads and I’ll kill you!” 

A bullet smashed into Smith’s 
leg. He screamed and flailed the 
axe. Shouting curses and threats, he 
crawled through the brush. The 
hunters crawled after him. 

Sordman located Smith. He 
shuddered as malice bit the edges 
of his mipd. He sang a long note of 
praise to life. 

HEN he opened his mind. 
Listen, Smith. I’m your friend. 
I am Sordman, the Protector of all, 
of the hunters and the hunted. I 
come in love. I am Sordman, small 
brother of the Lord, bubble in the 
Fountain of Creation . 

Once men had thought a Talent 
would fell his opponents with a 
blast of mental energy. It wasn’t 
that easy. Sordman had to find the 
cause of Smith’s hate. He was no 
rifleman, hurling a blast of energy, 
but a surgeon probing for the 
source of a disease. 

Two minds tangled. Sordman 
bore the light of himself into dark- 
ness. 

— I’ll kill you, too. Get out of 
me. Get out! 

Snarl, growl, slash. Two minds 
linked as one. Sordman fighting 
Sordman, Smith fighting Smith. 



SORDMAN THE PROTECTOR 



101 



Aaaaaaaah! 

He doubled up on the floor and 
hugged his knees. The Protector 
wept and sobbed. Hate! How he 
hated hate. How he wanted to kill 
the haters. They clawed his brain, 
they tortured every moment, and 
yet he had to love them. Love 
them! 

God, grant your servant strength. 
Be merciful . 

He had lost his contact but he 
had to go back. Weak man or not, 
he had to return or Smith would 
die. 

- I’ll kill them all. 

He saw the hunters creeping 
after him. He felt his body’s dirty 
sweat and the blood draining on 
his leg. Run, said his belly. A hun- 
ter fired. He saw a blue morning 
coat in the bush and felt the gun 
pointed at his head. Kill! 

The axe swung back in his hand. 
He remembered the swift stroke, 
the hard resistance of the spine, 
the joy of having struck and won. 
I never got to win. They always 
held me back. My hands wouldn’t 
paint what I told them, my mind 
wouldn’t reach where I wanted to 
go. When I loved Raven she didn’t 
let me out, she denied me, she 
made me hold my feelings back. 
But now I strike! Now I swing an 
unfettered arm. 

Sordman knew what he was 
joined with now. Smith was what 
the psycher Talents called an un- 
opened personality. A mind totally 



absorbed in what things meant to 
itself. A mind which had not 
learned to feel the pain and joy of 
other minds. 

Smith’s arm had stretched all 
the way back. He had to act now 
or someone else would die. He was 
Sordman the Protector, one of the 
four best Talents in the world and 
his powers were running like a 
river at flood. All he had to do was 
make the right move. 

He linked Smith’s mind with the 
mind of the rifleman. 

nPHE man in the blue morning 
coat was forty-three years old. 
He worked in New York City, the 
assistant manager of a transporta- 
tion line’s local office. His second 
wife had grown pregnant by acci- 
dent, which under law meant they 
were automatically married for 
life. They had been married for 
fifteen years and still didn’t know 
each other. His two sons thought 
he was a spineless old fool who 
slept all the time and couldn’t give 
them what they needed. He didn’t 
like his job but he knew it was all 
he would ever do, an exact defini- 
tion of his limits. Alone in his 
house, imprisoned by his work, he 
smoked and slept and ate without 
appetite. 

But now he aimed his rifle and 
thought, I’ll kill the witch. That 
will be something. I’ll know I did 
that. 

The two minds were one. Each 



102 



GALAXY 



knew the other’s pain, the other’s 
fear. If one died, the other felt his 
death. 

Each recognized the other 
man’s hunger, his frustration, his 
imprisonment within his body and 
the limits of his life. 

Sordman felt the weight of their 
lives. He gathered in the strength 
he called a gift. His voice and 
mind, his total self, sang the Lit- 
urgy of Joy. He gave his feelings 
and thoughts. 

The axe dropped. 

The finger squeezed the trigger 
and the bullet cut the bark from a 
tree. 

His thoughts became a lullaby, 
a drowsy murmuring of peace and 
healing sleep. 

George and Lee ran from the 
woods. 

“Andy! Don’t shoot them. 
Andy!” 



“Where?” 

— Here. 

He wiggled the leaves and 
branches of the brush. 

- Here! 

They stood over the unconscious 
men. The hunters crept from their 
hiding spots and joined them. 

“We’ll bring him in,” George 
said. “A psycher team is on the 
way.” 

— Good. 

Lee said, “You feel tired, Andy.” 
— I think they get harder. They 
take more out of me. Lee? 

“What, Andy?” 

— It’ll never end, will it? 

He was a young man speaking 
to an older person. He had seen 
much of humanity, but there were 
things only years could tell. 
“Probably not. Is it too much?” 
-No.

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



K EVINSON opened his eyes 
to bright sunlight stream- 
ing through a large win- 
dow. He looked down at his feet 
and past them to the foot of the 
bed. Bed? What was he doing in 
bed? He tried hard to think. White 
walls white sheets white bed bright 
sunlight. He sat up with a start. 
Hospital. 



Then he saw the man sitting in 
the chair beside his bed. Tall, mid- 
dle-aged, the man had a weather- 
lined face tanned by some alien 
sun. He was putting out a cigarette 
and smiling at Kevinson. 

“Good afternoon,” he said. “I’m 
Colonel Griffin, Federation Intelli- 
gence. Feel like talking, Major?” 
Kevinson looked at the Colonel,

noted the battle ribbons on his 
crisply tailored jacket and the 
double eagles on his shoulder. He 
lay back down on the soft pillow 
and closed his eyes. The instant he 
did, he suddenly remembered. The 
six red dots coming out of nowhere 
on the screen, the nerve-jangling 
clang of battle stations and no time 
to think, no time to do anything, 
just punch the button and get the 
hell out. And after that — 

Kevinson grimaced. After that, 
what? 

“Take it easy, Major — you’ve 
had a rough time of it,” said the 
Colonel. He gave Kevinson’s arm 
a strong, friendly grip. “You tell 
me what you can remember and I’ll 
fill you in.” 

“There isn’t much to tell,” said 
Kevinson. “I spotted the Kjard 
patrol as they came out of sub- 
drive, punched the random escape 
pattern and — well, I guess we 
made it.” 

Colonel Griffin smiled, lit a ciga- 
rette, and held out the pack to 
Kevinson. 

“That’s about the way we figured 
it must have happened,” said Grif- 
fin. “You got into sub-drive all 
right, but the Kjard hit you with a 
stunner first. You and your crew 
drifted around for two days before 
we found you. All sleeping like 
babies.” 

Kevinson reddened. 

“Don’t worry about it,” grinned 
the Colonel. “It could happen to 



anyone. Dealing with the Kjard is 
tricky business.” 

“Thank you, sir,” said Kevinson. 
He was suddenly very fond of the 
friendly Colonel. Not like some of 
those Intelligence characters. You 
could trust a man like Colonel Grif- 
fin. You could tell him anything. A 
guy like that had seen action some- 
where besides back of a desk. 

“Now about your mission,” said 
Griffin, “it was a very important as- 
signment, as you know, Major. And 
since you won’t be up and around 
for a few days, we’d like to get all 
we can — you know, fill in for the 
next crew that goes out. Now let’s 
see, you were to patrol Sector 74 
and—” 

CLICK! 

Kevinson sat up. The sweat was 
cold under his arms and the blue 
light hurt his eyes. The thrum of 
sub-space engines tingled in his legs 
and there was no white bed, no 
bright sunlight, no Colonel Griffin. 

Kevinson felt sick. Then he felt 
nothing. 

TVf" ARSHAL Ftel sat behind his 
desk with his eyes half 
closed and his thick arms crossed 
over his furry chest. Adjutant Nvec 
stood at attention before him. The 
Adjutant looked a little like a tall 
grizzly bear that had been left out 
in the rain too long. He was 
younger than Marshal Ftel and his 
pelt was still a pale silky blue. 
Nvec made a gentle mumbling

sound in his throat and the Mar- 
shal opened his eyes and glowered. 

“I am not sleeping, Nvec. It is 
not necessary to make noises.” 
“Yes, sir,” said Nvec. “I have the 
reports, sir.” 

“Then read them to me.” 

“Yes, sir. Major Kevinson lasted 
one minute and sixteen seconds un- 
der illusion. Then—” 

“Then,” said Ftel sourly, “you 
came right out and asked him what 
his mission was and he blacked 
out.” Ftel turned his cold red eyes 
on Adjutant Nvec. “Don’t you 
have any finesse, Nvec? 

“Sir,” stammered Nvec, “it’s very 
seldom an officer talks under illu- 
sion. We—” 

“All right, Nvec, don’t tell me 
things I am aware of already. Get 
on with your report.” 

Nvec cleared his throat and con- 
tinued. “Sir, report from Neural 
Examination is as follows: Kevin- 
son was born in—” 

Ftel’s great fist slammed down 
on his desk. “For Tree’s sake, I 
don’t want to hear another Terr an 
life history! Dog named Rover or 
Spot, check? Kissed the girl next 
door at fifteen, check? Now get on 
with it! What did you find on him? 
What have I got to work with?” 
Ftel fumed and settled his huge 
bulk lower in his chair. 

N VEC leafed through his papers 
and began to read again. “One 
nerve-deadener control in base of 

106 



spine just below skin, hidden be- 
neath mole. Control contained 
built-in breaking-point circuit with 
confession-selector timer and 478 
separate pain-level nodes. We 
found four more nerve control cen- 
ters over his body, two obvious 
fakes, and others interconnected on 
a random circuit efficient up to 
twelve levels of standard psychic 
interrogation.” Nvec took a deep 
breath and turned a page. “We also 
found six micro-transmitter grids, 
one very well hidden between two 
layers of toenail tissue.” 

“Ridiculous,” grunted Ftel in 
annoyance. 

“Sir?” 

“Go on.” 

“Yes, sir. There were fourteen 
dummy pain neutralizers, six very 
easy to detect, three medium-well 
hidden, three very secure, two 
which we almost missed.” 

And a dozen more, thought Ftel 
sourly, that you’ll probably never 
find. Oh, for the days of rack and 
thumbscrew. 

“In the brain,” Nvec went on, 
“we have uncovered and dug 
through or bypassed 87 neural 
blocks with interlocked variations. 
Also 36 cover alternates, with cor- 
responding backgrounds, personal- 
ities and missions.” 

Nvec stopped. 

Marshal Ftel looked up. “Is that 
all? Nothing besides the standard 
equipment?” 

“Well, sir, there are the usual in- 
G A LAX Y 



dications. But with their delicate 
neural structures, we don’t dare 
dig any deeper.” 

“No,” growled Ftel, “not ordi- 
narily. But this time we’ve got to 
try. Headquarters has an idea 
there’s something big going on. Cru- 
cial point of the war and all that 
sort of thing. If the Terrans are up 
to something in this sector, we’d 
better find out what it is.” He 
studied Nvec from under silvery 
brows. “I’m sure you don’t relish 
the thought of your mates receiv- 
ing a package with your pelt in it 
any more than I do, Nvec.” 

“No, sir.” Nvec swallowed. 
“What do you suggest, sir?” 

“Use the psycher and see if you 
can find any more deep-set indica- 
tions that we can get to. I know 
they can implant a block lower 
than the levels indicated by your 
report.” 

Nvec nodded. 

“But be careful,” warned Ftel. 
“Remember the suicide circuit. Cut 
through that with the wrong fre- 
quency and that’s it. He’s no good 
to us dead or insane.” 

Nvec saluted and lumbered to- 
ward the door. 

“And Nvec—” 

“Sir?” 

“Remember, if the fur flies on 
this’ deal, we all get tanned.” He 
paused and raised a pudgy finger. 
“But you first, Adjutant.” 

Nvec saluted nervously and soft- 
ly closed the door. 



Ftel glanced at the pile of reports 
on his desk, mumbled a low ob- 
scenity to himself, and pulled a 
bottle of Bvorlta from his pouch. 
In the female Kjard, the pouch was 
used for carrying young. The male 
Kjard had long ago found other, 
more practical uses. 

l^EVINSON was well aware he 
was being run through the 
Kjardian mill, and doubly aware 
there wasn’t a thing he could do 
about it. The Corps spent approxi- 
mately $40,000 per officer prepar- 
ing for just such an event, and now 
it was up to his mental blocks, psy- 
chic torture adjusters, confession 
nodes and whatever else they had 
in him to do the job. 

Kevinson’s mind below the 
primary and secondary levels was 
now a complete blank, both to Kev- 
inson himself and, with luck, to the 
Kjard. The answers he would give, 
or had already given, came to his 
conscious mind from a source over 
which he had no control. 

The war with the Kjard was now 
in its eighth year. Space maneuv- 
ers were intricate operations, in- 
volving tremendous expenditures 
of time, materiel, men and money. 
Once a fleet was committed to ac- 
tion, it was a gargantuan task to 
pull it out and unwind its complex 
coordinates and divert it in a new 
and doubly complex direction. If 
there was anything left to divert. 

As the war progressed, prisoner

interrogation methods improved, 
and counter-interrogation became 
a fine art. The $40,000 worth of 
neural implants was considered 
well worth the expense if an offi- 
cer could be kept from revealing 
the maneuvers of a 40-billion-dol- 
lar operation. 

Of course, the cost of training 
every crewman was prohibitive. 
The Federation and the Kjard 
solved this problem by simply 
keeping their crewmen in the dark 
about everything not connected 
with their immediate duties. This 
suited the crewmen fine. When cap- 
tured, they told all they knew 
about military matters— which was 
nothing. 

The officers had much the same 
reassurance; they knew they 
wouldn’t be physically tortured, 
and they knew they couldn’t talk. 

There was only one hitch. Coun- 
ter-Interrogation tried to keep up 
with new developments, but de- 
fense and offense seldom overlap. 
If you happened to be unlucky 
enough to be captured at the wrong 
stage of this game — tough. When 
they probed within range of your 
secret, a little alarm went off some- 
where in your built-in circuits and 
a switch closed before the informa- 
tion could be extracted. The 
suicide circuit. 

And that, thought Kevinson as 
they strapped him down again, was 
something to think about. 

Marshal Ftel stood in the back- 



ground with Adjutant Nvec. They 
were watching Group Seven in a 
series of twelve tests designed to 
bypass the suicide circuit of Major 
Kevinson and bring his informa- 
tion up to an extractable level. Ftel 
had taken a very personal interest 
in the Kevinson tests. Confirming 
information indicated that Kevin- 
son had almost certainly been cap- 
tured while scouting for a major 
Federation breakthrough. Ftel was 
taking every precaution to keep 
his own pelt in one piece. Kevin- 
son’s unmanned ship continued to 
send routine reports back to Fed- 
eration headquarters. Every detail, 
every scrap of information col- 
lected from the vital sectors in- 
volved was filtered and sifted 
through Ftel’s office. But Kevinson 
himself was the key — if he couldn’t 
be broken, the rest of the informa- 
tion was worthless. 

“What are they doing now?” 
asked Ftel impatiently. 

“Sir, they are testing to discover 
the type of suicide circuits that 
have been planted in Kevinson. If 
they can isolate the method in 
which his system will be de- 
stroyed—” 

“I know, I know,” snapped Ftel. 
“I mean what area are they work- 
ing on?” 

“The stomach tissue, sir. If you 
recall, sir, Area Nine lost a lieu- 
tenant two weeks ago when a virus 
in his stomach mutated as we made 
contact.” 



108 



GALAXY 



“They’re still testing for that? 
Federation’s probably changed the 
circuit a dozen times in two 
weeks!” Ftel turned on Nvec, rais- 
ing a hairy paw to the Adjutant’s 
Face. “Fumble this for me and you 
won’t see another shedding season.” 
He turned and stalked out of the 
room, feeling to see if the bottle of 
Bvorlta was still in his pouch. 

Kevinson was conscious of what 
was being done to him, but he re- 
fused to let it bother him. Or, 
rather, certain circuits told him it 
didn’t bother him, which was just 
as good, if not better. 

He knew, for instance, that the 
Kjard were probing his stomach 
with sonic scalpels, and he could 
feel the wave pulsations running 
through his body. One certain note 
made his teeth ache. He hoped the 
suicide circuit wasn’t in his teeth. 

One of the Kjard grinned, re- 
vealing a set of strong white molars. 
“Don’t worry,” he said. “We al- 
ready checked the teeth.” 

Kevinson glanced up. The Kjard 
wore earphones and evidently had 
the dull job of monitoring Kevin- 
son’s primary thoughts. 

“Thanks,” thought Kevinson, 
“you overgrown, smelly slob.” 

The Kjard flushed. 

THINK,” said Marshal Ftel, 
“that we are finally getting 
somewhere, Nvec.” 

Nvec smiled broadly. “I certain- 
ly hope so, sir.” 



Ftel frowned. “Get overconfi- 
dent, though, and we’ll pull some 
fool trick like Gtem, in Area Four.” 
He bent over the reports again. 

Nvec shuddered. He had read 
the official report on the late Mar- 
shal Gtem, who had somehow let 
a two-cluster Federation Admiral 
die under the probe. 

“Sir?” asked Nvec. 

“Hmmm?” Ftel didn’t look up. 

“Sir, what happens to a Federa- 
tion officer who — makes mistakes 
— big mistakes, sir?” 

“Like Gtem made, you mean?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“And Gtem’s Adjutant?” 

“Yes, sir,” said Nvec. 

Ftel looked up. “They get pro- 
moted, Nvec.” 

“Sir?” 

“I believe the Terran term is 
‘kicked upstairs.’ And don’t ask me 
to explain it to you.” Ftel bent over 
his work again. 

“Yes, sir,” said Nvec, who was so 
engrossed in the wonders of alien 
psychology that he forgot to salute 
as he left. 

Kevinson was being wheeled 
down the long corridor again. By 
now, he had lost all count of the 
number of times he had gone from 
the tiny room, down the hall, and 
into the examining chamber. Any 
estimate of the elapsed time since 
his capture would have to include 
periods under sedation, narco-

states that can only be described 
as variations on semi-conscious- 
ness and pseudo-death. 

As far as Kevinson was con- 
cerned, anywhere from thirty sec- 
onds to ten thousand years had 
swept dreamily by. 

At present, he was aware of two 
things. The pale blue Kjard light- 
ing was giving him a headache 
again, as it always did when he 
was conscious enough to realize he 
had a head. Secondly, he was dim- 
ly aware that there was entirely 
too much activity going on for a 
regular examination period. The 
corridor was literally swarming 
with Kjard officers and technicians. 

One Kjard in particular seemed 
to express a keen interest in him. 
Kevinson had never seen him be- 
fore, at least not that he could 
remember, but he rocognized the 
silver triple-spangled shoulder in- 
signia as the badge of a full Mar- 
shal of Interrogation. 

As they reached the examination 
chamber, it was the Marshal him- 
self who put the blinder helmet 
over Kevinson’s eyes. The helmet 
was only used during certain 
phases of the examination, and 
Kevinson hadn’t yet decided 
whether it was to keep the patient 
from seeing what was being done 
to him out of kindness or for secu- 
rity reasons. 

While Kevinson was being 
readied for examination, Marshal 
Ftel took the opportunity to in- 



spect the interrogation equipment. 
There was no reason for a Marshal 
to inspect the equipment personal- 
ly, but Ftel knew the technicians 
expected it of him, and would lose 
respect for him if he failed to find 
a spot of grease or a bit of dust. 

Ftel had been in the business 
long enough to know that a satis- 
fied officer might well expect to 
wake up some morning with his 
pelt nailed to a bulkhead. 

"C 1 ROM the far wall of the exami- 
nation chamber, a thirty-foot 
bank of gleaming bronze-colored 
instruments circled in an arc 
around the central examining 
table. The table was joined to the 
bank by a tangled snarl of multi- 
colored cable which occasionally 
bypassed the bank itself to join 
other instruments placed at ran- 
dom on the walls, floor and even 
the ceiling. At the beginning of 
the war, the examination chamber 
had been a neat and orderly place 
to work in; now it resembled a 
weird organism that had not quite 
made up its mind what it wanted 
to be when it grew up. Of neces- 
sity, the chamber was in a constant 
state of flux, a desperate race to 
adapt to new developments of the 
enemy as well as the efforts of their 
own technicians. 

The miles of cable, tons of tubes, 
transistors, switches and just plain 
gadgets were being readied for 
what Ftel believed to be the most 



TO TELL THE TRUTH 



111 



important job they would ever per- 
form: the extraction of vital infor- 
mation from the mind of Major 
Kevinson. For weeks, the techni- 
cians had worked around the clock 
for this moment. First, the various 
primary level mental and physical 
protective and confusion blocks 
were removed. Then, and more 
carefully, the secondary probes 
went after the subtler devices. Here 
the danger to Kevinson, and indi- 
rectly to the Kjard, became acute. 
A hasty probe or a mistaken analy- 
sis and the suicide circuit could 
bring the examination to a deathly 
halt. During this phase, Marshal 
Ftel’s pelt itched constantly, and 
his supply of Bvorlta ran alarming- 
ly low. 

Adjutant Nvec lumbered up to 
Ftel and huffed smartly to atten- 
tion. “Sir, we are ready to begin.” 
Ftel paused, his eyes on the Ter- 
ran strapped to the examining 
table. Then he nodded to Nvec. 

Kevinson was aware of being 
questioned. Whether the voice 
came from inside or out of his head, 
though, was impossible to tell. 

“Kevinson,” said the voice, “you 
will be asked several questions. 
You will answer them all with one 
word: True. You will answer in 
this manner until otherwise in- 
structed. Do you fully understand 
what you are to do?” 

Kevinson answered, “Yes, fully.” 
“Your name is Bruce B. Kevin- 
son?” 



“True.” 

“You hold the rank of Major in 
the Federation Forces?” 

“True.” 

“Your serial number is KH- 
77590933 ?” 

“True.” 

“A man can live on the face of 
the sun?” 

“True.” 

“A man can breathe in space 
without benefit of a protective 
suit?” 

“True.” 

The questioner paused. Glanc- 
ing at the lighted panel by his side, 
he noted that Kevinson’s test ques- 
tions had all been answered as they 
should be. The bank of lights also 
indicated that Kevinson realized 
the last two answers should have 
been False. The questioner nodded 
to his assistants and more switches 
were thrown into play. New banks 
of lights flickered on and off, and 
the emergency organ bank next to 
Kevinson’s body hummed into life. 

Ftel could feel the moisture 
creep up under his pelt. The organ 
bank meant they were ready to 
proceed to third level probing. 
Here they would certainly come up 
against the suicide circuit and, if 
successful, disarm it. If any organ 
in Kevinson’s body were destroyed 
in the process, they would attempt 
to keep him alive by cutting in a 
duplicate organ from the bank. 

And, Ftel uneasily thought, 
probably unsuccessfully. The sui- 



112 



GALAXY 



cide circuit was usually too quick 
and too thorough; likely to set off 
half a dozen alternate circuits be- 
fore the organ bank could take con- 
trol. 

A N hour later, Kevinson was no 
longer conscious of existing. 
The protective devices left in his 
mind and body had taken com- 
plete control in a last-ditch effort 
to guard the thoughts deep within 
his brain. 

“Circuit TG,” said the head tech- 
nician. 

“Activated.” 

“Begin probe in Area V.” 
“Easy!” 

“Give me a check on that. We 
hit something” 

“There . Now!” 

Kevinson’s mind reacted to the 
shock of the probe with all its avail- 
able weapons. Two shields were 
penetrated, and then another. As 
the probe delicately pushed 
through to the fourth, a green light 
buzzed and blinked frantically on 
the control panel. 

The Kjard technician hastily 
withdrew. His pelt was soaked and 
his paws shook. “We nearly did it. 
That was the suicide circuit.” 

His assistant frowned in disbe- 
lief. “The circuit? In conjunction 
with the shield?” 

“Something new, all right. Call 
the Marshal over here.” 

Ftel and Nvec hastily joined the 
technicians at the table. 



“What is it?” said Ftel. “What’s 
wrong?” 

“We’ve hit a barrier with a sui- 
cide circuit implanted in a field 
around it. If we try to break 
through, we’ll set it off. If we don’t 
break through, we’ll never get any- 
thing. I feel sure the shield we’re 
after is a major block.” 

Ftel bit his lip and scowled. Sur- 
rounding a shield with a circuit was 
something the Kjard or the enemy 
were bound to come up with even- 
tually. Now it was here. 

Ftel cursed under his breath and 
turned to the head technician. 
“You’re convinced it’s a major 
block?” 

“Yes, sir. I’m almost certain it’s 
the major block.” 

“Hmmm. That means we can’t 
bypass it.” 

“Not to any advantage, sir.” 

“Go ahead and try. We can’t do 
anything else,” grunted Ftel. 

The technician nodded grimly. 
His assistant shrugged and began. 

Kevinson’s mind screamed in 
agony and fought back with savage 
force. The probe penetrated the 
suicide circuit and began to im- 
plode. 

“He’s gone!” hissed the techni- 
cian. 

“No. Wait.” 

“He’s gone, I tell you! We set 
it off!” 

“No, by Tree, we stopped it!” 

“It won’t hold long! Disarm, 
quickly!” 



TO TELL THE TRUTH 



113 



A moment later, the head tech- 
nician nodded to Ftel and sank 
weakly to a chair. 

Ftel reached in his pouch and, 
to Nvec’s everlasting astonishment, 
brought out a bottle of Bvorlta and 
offered it to the Adjutant. 

The rest was routine. Kevinson 
came slowly out of shock, his mind 
naked and open, stripped bare of 
protection. The first horrifying 
thing he remembered was his mis- 
sion. Then the voice went to work. 
“Your instructions, please, Major 
Kevinson.” 

Kevinson answered without 
hesitation. There was no way he 
could stop himself now. “I am a 
Sector Scout for Federation Battle 
Fleets XII, XXVI, XVIII, XLI 
and XLV.” 

“Great Stars,” whispered Ftel, “I 
knew it! A major attack force!” He 
could almost feel the new silver 
cluster on his shoulder. 

Kevinson talked. He talked 
about the fleet coordinates, he 
talked about rendezvous sectors, he 
talked about the armament of each 
individual class of vessel, he talked 
about any and every item the 
Kjard wished to know. And when 
it was over, and he was wheeled 
out of the chamber and back 
toward his room, Kevinson broke. 
Now there were no protective de- 
vices to ward off his apprehensions 
and fears. Now, although he had 
been helpless to stop himself, he 
had talked. And he knew it. 



Ftel watched Kevinson disap- 
pear down the pale blue hall. A 
wide grin spread across his furry 
jaws. 

r P WO months after the battle, In- 
terrogation Marshal Ftel stared 
sullenly at the wall aboard the Fed- 
eration Prison Ship Bat Masterson. 
He was uncomfortable, in spite of 
the fact that his rank entitled him 
to sit near the only air shaft. 
“Hello, Marshal Ftel.” 

Ftel started and looked up. A 
tall man in Federation blues stood 
above him. Ftel cringed. 

“Kevinson,” he said. “How nice 
of you to drop in.” Adjutant Nvec 
looked on, his furry jowls hanging 
wide. 

“I heard you were aboard,” said 
Kevinson, “so I thought I’d say 
hello.” 

“Thank you,” said Ftel. 

“I thought you’d like to know—” 
“I already know,” mumbled Ftel. 
“It was a simple, ridiculous plan 
that anyone could have seen 
through. So it worked, naturally. 
Since you couldn’t lie to us, you did 
the next worse thing — you told us 
the truth.” 

“Or rather,” added Kevinson, 
“what I was told was the truth.” 
Ftel’s shoulders drooped heavily. 
“I’m not a Fleet Admiral. If Head- 
quarters acts on my information, 
that’s their business.” 

“Anything you need?” asked 
Kevinson. 



114 



GALAXY 



“Yes,” said Ftel, “a drink.” 
“Sorry,” grinned Kevinson. “But 
I will see if I can get these lights 
dimmed.” Ftel murmured his 
thanks. 

Later, Nvec turned to Marshal 
Ftel. “Sir?” 

“What is it?” 

“Sir,” said Nvec, “I’ve been won- 



dering. I noticed Major Kevinson 
has been promoted to Colonel, and 
you said the Federation, as you 
put it, kicked its officers upstairs 
when they made mistakes — big 
mistakes.” 

“Oh, shut up!” snapped Marshal 
Ftel.

FORECAST 



You know, people living in a Golden Age never are aware that they 
are, except in retrospect, and then only by contrast. Maybe those contrasts 
shouldn't happen to a dog, but they don't last forever, and it takes a spell of 
them, it seems, to make the superlative the highest one can attain, not the 
least one will settle for What topples Golden Ages? More than anything else, 
perhaps, it's the hopeless job of trying to greaten greatest into greatester, 
greatestest, and on from there. Cases in point are such masterworks as Gravy 
Planet. No, Virginia, they didn't win instant acclaim. Instant yelps and welts 
is what they raised. When the howling ceased — the things were unfamiliar, 
you see, and had to be lived with a while to lose their dangerous aspects, the 
danger being new ideas — then they emerged as masterpieces. Gravy Planet 
is chosen as the prime example because Frederik Pohl's DRUNKARD'S WALK 
is sure to be compared unfavorably with it by at least one terribly tired, ter- 
ribly disenchanted reviewer, though Pohl's mastery is far more mature, sure, 
complete, than in the earlier story. 

For we are at the beginning of another Golden Age, in which Pohl and 
other gladly welcomed old masters welcome as gladly as we do the appear- 
ance of vital, vigorous new talents to the 1 960s. 

The names are unfamiliar, but only for now: William W. Stuart, Allen 
Kim Lang, Neal Barrett, Jr., Jim Harmon, R. A. Lafferty — it's a long, exciting 
list that goes on and on. 

Where were they all this while? Serving their apprenticeships, honing 
their talents, building writing muscles, getting ready for the big time . 
and it's here. Galaxy, ending its tenth year, is going into its next decade with 
a Golden Age. This could be the first in the history of man that's recognized 
as such, and not only in retrospect, but while it's going on. Not a chance? 
Stick around and see!

A TREASURY OF GREAT 
SCIENCE FICTION, edited by 
Anthony Boucher. Doubleday & 
Co., Inc., N.Y., $5.95 for two 
volumes. 

A DOUBLE-BARRELED uniqu- 
ity, this nevertheless needs indi- 
vidual treatment. Each volume 
has two full-length novels, a cou- 
ple. of novellas, some novelettes 
and some shorts. 

Volume One has Wyndham’s 
excellent Rebirth and van Vogt’s 
intricate Weapon Shops of Isher 
as novel attractions. The two 
novellas are “The (Widget), the 
(Wadget) and Boff,” a big bit 



of Sturgeon, and Heinlein’s fam- 
ous “Waldo.” Novelettes: “Pillar 
of Fire,” typically off-trail Brad- 
bury, and the haunting “Chil- 
dren’s Hour” by Kuttner and 
Moore. Best of the shorts are 
“Gomez” by Kornbluth and “The 
Father-Thing” by Phillip K. 
Dick. 

Despite weak sisters, the total 
of superior wordage is high.

“The Man Who Sold the

N. Y., $2.95 

GRINNELL, STRIVING for the 
shock effect of unleashed imagi- 
nation, succeeds instead in cre- 
ating a comic strip without pic- 
tures. 

His tarnished hero, holing up 
from the law in Arizonia, rescues 
an alien from the wreckage of its 
space vehicle. Before death, the 
alien implants a message in his 
host’s arm bone plus a compul- 
sion to deliver the message to 
Pluto. To insure delivery, the 
hero, unlike children, will be seen 
but not noticed. 

With this handy attribute, the 



ex-con reaches Russia unnoticed, 
tossing test animals from its 
moon missile to make room for 
himself. Now the tale starts to 
get a bit confusing. Another set 
of invaders mixes in. There’s a 
rescue from Mars in a fossil

lack of power and raw materials. 
Their outwitting of a would-be 
Peter Minuit who attempts a re-

The remainder of the book,

it is debatable whether his two 
trepid travelers have actually 
gone back to Classical Periclean 
Greece or whether the Golden 
Age has come forward to the

De Camp’s neat puzzle de-

about modern Greece by a maga- 
zine reporter and the bereft hus- 
band of a kidnapped wife. Their 
shipwreck occurs in ancient 
Greece — or does it? 

Robert A. Heinlein’s foreword 
points out that the wellspring of 
de Camp’s humor is the human 
quality of his characters. Heroes 
and villains alike are bumblers 
and never drawn bigger than life. 
So, though there isn’t a belly- 
laugh in the book, there are 
plenty of chuckles and unosten-

COATES’ INTRODUCTION ac- 
knowledges his intimate acquaint- 
ance with the Paris of the 
Twenties and its fabulous inhab- 
itants: Gertrude Stein, James 

Joyce, Ezra Pound, Picasso, Satie, 
etc. In those days, for a book to 
sell well denoted failure of a 
sort. So, thirty-odd years after 
its original satisfactorily limited 
success, Putnam’s reprint is now 



risking failure of a sort. 

Since murders are committed 
from afar by an undetectible X- 
ray Bullet, there is no doubt that 
the story is also science fiction of 
a sort, even though it has been 
called the first surrealist novel 
in English.

BY L. J. STECHER, JR. 

A Delta class freighter can 
carry anything— maybe more 
than its skipper can bear! 



Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



A DELTA class freighter 
isn’t pretty to look at, but 
it can be adapted to car- 
ry most anything, and occasional- 
ly even to carry it profitably. So 
when I saw one I didn’t recognize 
sitting under the gantry at Helm- 
holtz Spaceport, I hurried right 
over to Operations. 

It looked as if I might be able 
122 



to get my Gasha root off-planet 
before it started to spoil, after all. 

It was the Delta Crucis, they 
told me. She was a tramp, and she 
hadn’t yet been signed for a cargo. 
The skipper was listed as his own 
agent. They told me where they 
thought I could find him, so I 
drifted over to the Spaceport bar, 
and looked around. 



GALAXY 



I found my man quickly enough. 
He had the young-old look of a 
deep spacer. He wore a neat but 
threadbare blue uniform, with the 
four broad gold rings of command 
—rather tarnished— on each sleeve. 
He had a glass of rhial — a liquor 
that was too potent for my taste- 
in front of him at ten o’clock in 
the morning, and that wasn’t a 
good sign. But he looked sober 
enough. 

So I picked up a large schooner 
of beer at the bar and strolled 
over to his table in the far corner 
away from the window. 

“Mind if I join you?” I asked 
casually. “I hate to drink alone.” 

He stared at me for a minute 
out of those pale-blue spacer’s 
eyes of his, until I figured he 
thought he had me catalogued. 

Then he motioned me to the 
chair across from his at the small 
table. We sat for a few minutes 
in silence, sizing each other up. 

“That’s a mighty nice looking 
freighter out there on pad seven,” 

I said at last. “Yours?” 

TTE uncapped his glass, took a 
sip of rhial, snicked the cover 
back, and let the heady stuff 
evaporate in his mouth. He 
breathed in sharply in the ap- 
proved manner, but he didn’t even 
shudder. He just nodded slowly, 
once. 

That appeared to pass the con- 
versational ball back to me. “I 
AN ELEPHANT FOR THE PRI 



might have a cargo for you, if you 
can handle it,” I said. “I hear 
these Delta class ships can man- 
age almost anything, but this is a 
rough one. The Atmabelle is the 
only ship in the area built to take 
my stuff, and she’s grounded with 
transposer troubles.” 

He cocked one sandy eyebrow 
at me. I interpreted this to be a 
request for the nature of my cargo, 
so I told him, and let him ponder 
about it for a while. 

“Gasha root,” he said at last, 
and nodded once. “I can handle 
it. That’ll be easy, for Delta Cru- 
c is. Like you said, she can handle 
anything. Her last cargo was a live 
elephant.” 

We completed our deal without 
much trouble. He drove a hard 
bargain, but a fair one, and he 
had plenty of self-confidence. He 
signed a contingent-on-satisfac- 
tory-delivery contract, and that’s 
unusual for a ship that’s handling 
Gasha. Hadn’t thought I’d be so 
lucky. Gasha is tricky stuff. 

We went over to the Govern- 
ment office to complete the deal 

— customs arrangements, notari- 
zations, posting bonds and so forth 

— but we finally signed the con- 
tract, all legal and binding. His 
name turned out to be Bart Han- 
nah. 

Then, by unspoken consent, we 
went back to the bar. 

It was after noon, by that time, 
so I had a Scotch, and then I had 
N Kl P 123 



another. I was so relieved to have 
found a ship for my cargo that I 
didn’t even think about lunch. 

¥ GOT more and more mellow 
and talkative as time went by, 
but the skipper just sat there, 
breathing rhial. He didn’t seem 
to change a bit. 

Something had been bothering 
me, though, and I finally figured 
out what it was. So I stopped talk- 
ing about my farming troubles, 
and asked Captain Hannah a di- 
rect question. 

“You say you carried an ele- 
phant ?” I asked. “A live elephant? 
In a space ship?” 

He nodded. “It’s an animal,” he 
said. “A very large animal. From 
Earth.’’ 

“I know all about that,” I said. 
“We’re civilized here. We’re not 
just a bunch of back-planet hicks, 
you know. We study all about the 
Home Planet at school. But why 
— and how — would anyone take 
an elephant into space?” 

He stared at me for a while, 
then took a deep breath, and let 
it out slowly. “I’ll tell you,” he said. 
“After all, it’s nothing to be really 
ashamed of.” He pondered for a 
full minute. “It all started just a 
few standard months ago, on Con- 
dor — over in Sector Sixty-four 
W.” 

“Sixty-four W?” I broke in. 
“That’s clear over on the other, 
side of the Galaxy.” 

124 



He looked at me for awhile, and 
then went on just as if I hadn’t 
spoken. 

“I’d been doing all right with 
Delta Crucis” he said, “and salt- 
ing away plenty of cash, but I 
wasn’t satisfied. It was mostly 
short-haul stuff — ten or twenty 
light years — and it was mostly 
run-of-the-mill loads. Fleeder jew- 
els, kharran, morab fur — that sort 
of thing, you know. I was getting 
bored. They said a Delta class 
freighter could carry just about 
anything, and I wanted to prove 
it. So when I heard that a rich ec- 
centric, one planet out, on Penguin, 
might have an interesting job for 
me, I flitted right over. 

“The Prinkip of Penguin wasn’t 
just rich. He was rich rich. Pen- 
guin has almost twice the diameter 
of this planet, but it’s light enough 
to have about the same surface 
gravity. To give you an idea, its 
two biggest bodies of water are 
about the size of the Atlantic 
Ocean, back on the Earth you’ve 
studied so much about. On Pen- 
guin they call them lakes. And 
the Prinkip owns the whole planet 
— free and clear. I should be so 
lucky with Delta Crucis. 

iiTP HE Prinkip is a little skinny 
man, but that doesn’t keep 
him from having a large-size hob- 
by to go with his large-size planet 
The Prinkip collects animals — 
one from each planet in his sector. 

GALAXY 



He had a zoo with nearly three 
hundred monsters in it — always 
a sample of the largest kind from 
whatever planet it came from. 

“He showed me around. It was 
the damndest sight you ever saw. 
He had one animal called a pfleeg. 
It was almost two hundred feet 
long; it walked around on two legs 
and sang like a bird. He had an- 
other one that had two hundred 
and thirty-four legs on a side. I 
counted them. It had four sides. 
Didn’t care which one was up. He 
had animals under glass that didn’t 
breathe at all. He had one animal 
under a microscope that was about 
a thousandth of an inch long, but 
he told me that it was the biggest 
one on Fartolp. He had a big satel- 
lite stuck up overhead in a one- 
revolution-a-day orbit for animals 
that needed light gravity. He had 
thirty-seven more beasts in that. 
All in all, he had one animal from 
every planet in Sector Sixty-four 
W that had life. He figured that he 
needed just one more animal to 
complete his collection. He wanted 
a sample of a creature from the 
Home Planet; one live and healthy 
sample of Earth’s biggest animal. 
And he wanted to know if I could 
ship it to him. 

“Well, I didn’t give the matter 
too much thought. After all, I said 
to myself, if somebody had man- 
aged a three hundred ton monster 
almost two hundred feet long, I 
ought to be able to manage a little 
AN ELEPHANT FOR THE PRI 



bitty elephant. So I said yes, and I 
gave him a contingent-on-satisfac- 
tory-delivery contract, for one 
adult specimen of Earth’s largest 
animal, male or female, in good 
condition. 

“It wasn’t until about that time 
that the Prinkip told me how that 
biggest monster had been shipped. 
It had arrived in a cardboard box, 
wrapped in cotton. It seems that 
pfleeg eggs weigh just a little un- 
der three ounces. Well, I’d been 
done but I still figured I could 
make delivery.” 

TTE lapsed into silence for a mo- 
ment, thinking deeply. “Did 
you know that there are two kinds 
of elephants on Earth, the Afri- 
can and the Indian, and that they 
aren’t exactly the same size?” he 
asked. 

I shook my head. “Our schools 
don’t go that far,” I said. 

He nodded. “Neither do ours. 
So I immediately bought an In- 
dian elephant. They’re the kind, 
back on the Home planet, that 
you can find tame and easy to 
handle. They’re also the wrong 
kind. The only reason I didn’t 
head right back with it is that I 
was having trouble figuring out 
how to carry it in the Crucis. Even 
an Indian elephant weighs about 
six tons. At least, mine did. In 
itself, that’s not a very big load, 
but the trip back would take a 
good many months of subjective 
N K I P 125 




126 



GALAXY 



time, and of course elephants eat 
on subjective time. And how they 
eat! The food I carried would 
weigh the same as the elephant. 

“I wondered how elephants 
would like weightlessness, so I 
took my Indian elephant up on a 
little jaunt around Earth’s satel- 
lite. The Moon, they call it. Ele- 
phants don’t like weightlessness at 
all.” He paused, and signaled the 
bartender for another drink. “I 
hope you never have to clean up 
after a space-sick elephant,” he 
said darkly. 

“That meant that I’d have to 
put spin on the Crucis for the en- 
tire trip back to Penguin. It’s hard 
enough to try to navigate in hy- 
perspace with spin on your ship, 
but that wasn’t the worst of it. An 
elephant is a tremendous amount 
of off-center load for a ship with a 
large fraction of a one-gee spin on 
it. Too much load even to think 
about handling. Even though I 
couldn’t come up with an answer, 
right off hand, I went ahead and 
turned in my Indian elephant on 
an African model. Beulah was her 
name, and she was a husky girl. 
She weighed in at just a little 
more than eight tons.” 

I waved my whisky glass at 
Captain Hannah. “But I don’t see 
your problem,” I said. “If you put 
the elephant on one side and his 
food on the other, there wouldn’t 
be any off-balanced load, would 
there?” 

AN ELEPHANT FOR THE PRI 



“Not until the food was eaten, 
anyway,” said the skipper wither- 
ingly, and I subsided with a fresh 
drink. 

EULAH was kind of cute, 
for all of her tonnage,” said 
the skipper. “She had two enor- 
mous tusks, and a pair of ears like 
wings, and a nose that was longer 
than her tail. But she was mighty 
friendly, after she got to know 
me. She’d pick me up and carry 
me around, if I asked her to. And 
she’d eat right out of my hand. 
She turned out to be even tamer 
than the Indian elephant. All I 
had to do was figure out how to 
carry her. 

“For a starter, I figured like you 
said, to have Beulah on one side 
of the cargo compartment, and 
her chow on the other. Then I cal- 
culated to have my own supplies 
on the other two sides of the space, 
so that I could move them away 
from her as her food stocks got 
smaller, and hold the balance that 
way. That wasn’t enough, of 
course, so I built a couple of water 
tanks on the opposite side of the 
ring from Beulah. 

“As you know, not much can be 
done about moving water around 
in a space ship — it’s got its own 
cooling chores to perform — but 
every little bit helped. Finally, I 
jockeyed the master computer and 
the auxiliary computer down and 
ran them on tracks, so I could slide 
N K I P 127 



them around to compensate for 
Beulah’s appetite. Some lead slugs 
brought the auxiliary’s weight up 
equal to the master’s, and they also 
brought my total load up to the 
absolute maximum that I could 
carry. 

“It was almost enough. But a 
miss is as good as a mile, for a space 
ship. I was stuck, and there didn’t 
seem to be a thing I could do about 
it. Even if I could have carried 
more weight it wouldn’t have 
helped. Any more mass in the 
cargo compartment would have 
thrown the c.g. too far aft.” He 
beckoned for more rhial. 

“So what did you do?” I 
prompted. “You did say that you 
carried the elephant, didn’t you?” 

“Sure. Like I said, a Delta class 
freighter can do almost anything. 
Beulah gave me the answer herself. 
If you’ve ever lived with an ele- 
phant, one thing becomes clear 
mighty fast. They’re a mighty effi- 
cient machine for converting fod- 
der into elephant droppings. So I 
made a bin on the opposite side of 
the compartment from Beulah, and 
let l?er gradually fill it while she 
ate me out of balance. The weight 
of the — what’s a nice word for it?— 
was just enough to let me keep the 
whole setup in dynamic balance.” 

“Compost heap?” I suggested 
dreamily, picturing the arrange- 
ment in my mind. There was poet- 
ry in it. Or was it poetic justice that 
I had in mind? 



66 r T' HAT’S it,” said Captain 
Hannah. “Compost heap. 
Well, I started the journey with the 
ship full and Beulah and the com- 
post heap empty. I finished pretty 
much the other way around. I sup- 
pose it sounds easy, but it wasn’t. 

“I started off with Beulah 
chained down in the middle of the 
compartment, and everything 
stacked around her. She didn’t 
want me to leave when I went up 
to the bridge to take off, and hol- 
lered as piteously as you can imag- 
ine. But I couldn’t have a nurse 
for her — mahout, they call them. I 
couldn’t spare the weight. Or the 
salary, for that matter. She was 
chained down, so she couldn’t move 
around and upset the balance. 

“After chemical take off, we slid 
into parking orbit as sweet as you 
please. I hurried down to shift the 
load around. I didn’t want to stay 
weightless any longer than I had to, 
because I remembered that sick In- 
dian elephant — and Beulah out- 
weighed him by almost two tons, 
and had a larger stomach to match. 
Of course, the Indian elephant had 
gone into orbit on a full belly, and 
I hadn’t let Beulah have a bite to 
eat for hours. It made a difference, 
let me tell you. 

“Beulah made trouble in her 
own way, though. As soon as I got 
within reach, she grabbed me with 
that long nose of hers, and wouldn’t 
let go. She didn’t hurt me or any- 
thing like that; she just wanted 
GALAXY

company in her misery. I couldn’t 
coax her with food. The very 
thought of food made her shudder. 

“I couldn’t reach her chains to 
cut her loose, and I couldn’t reach 
the radio to call for help. If it hadn’t 
been for the Ionosphere Guard, I 
might have starved to death. I’d 
hired the parking orbit for twelve 
hours, and when I was still in it 
after that time, Port Control 
started to holler. I could hear them 
on my loud speaker, but I couldn’t 
answer them. So the Ionosphere 
Guard finally sent up a small craft 
with a lieutenant and a three-man 
crew in it to see what was wrong. 

<»(* I ' HOSE sailors were good. 

They didn’t even look sur- 
prised; they just went to work as 
if they handled elephants in space 
every day. They drove four lines 
through the ring bolts I’d welded 
in the spin-deck, cast Beulah loose 
and hauled her over to her new 
spot as neat as you please. 

“Then, no nonsense, the lieu- 
tenant ordered Beulah to let loose 
of me. She did, too. 

“After that they left, stopping for 
just one drink of my good bourbon. 
I didn’t drink rhial then. 

“I wirelessed Port Control my 
penalty fees and another twelve 
hour’s hire in the orbit, and started 
shifting the load. I was working on 
an empty stomach, and Beulah still 
didn’t feel hungry, so she didn’t re- 
mind me that I hadn’t eaten. I al- 



most collapsed before I got the job 
done. 

“Then I put spin on, which made 
Beulah comfortable at last, and 
tried to juggle the ship into a hyper- 
trajectory, still without stopping 
for food or sleep. It didn’t take long 
before Beulah started squalling for 
supper. After I fed her I had to ad- 
just balance all over again. By that 
time I was pushing my new twelve- 
hour limit, and I didn’t give much 
of a damn any more. I just counted 
to ten and pushed the button. Then 
I turned in and slept until Beulah 
started squalling for breakfast. I 
ignored her until I ate about three 
squares in a row, then I fed her anc 
adjusted balance. After that I 
checked my trajectory. 

“It was the best I’ve ever made 
in twenty-four years of jumping. It 
was beautiful. 

“So I turned back in again and 
slept until Beulah woke me for 
lunch. I didn’t know it at the time, 
but Beulah was eating for two. That 
possibility probably should have 
occurred to me earlier, what with 
the name ‘Beulah’, but you can’t 
think of everything, and there I 
was, the first man to go into hyper- 
space with an elephant. Anyway, 
it didn’t even worry me, even 
when I found out about it. I 
checked the contract. Everything 
seemed to be well covered. And 
according to my book on elephants, 
Beulah should still be only a po- 
tential mother when we reached 



AN ELEPHANT FOR THE PRINKIP 



129 



Penguin. As a matter of fact, the 
whole idea made me feel just a lit- 
tle bit proud. Like a father, you 
know? 

“What with having to shift 
weights after every meal, and Beu- 
lah setting the schedule for meals, 
I was kept mighty busy. My self- 
winding wristwatch overwound it- 
self and stopped, in spite of the ad- 
vertisements about it, and I didn’t 
find out for almost two weeks, sub- 
jective, that Beulah’s stomach ran 
fast. What’s more, I think she knew 
it. Because when I finally woke up 
to what was going on, and started 
to run her schedule by the clock, 
she didn’t fuss a bit. Beulah’s a 
clever girl. 

“I was so worn out when we fi- 
nally reached Penguin that I just 
slid into orbit, kept spin on, laid 
out a couple of extra meals for Beu- 
lah and slept the clock around. The 
Prinkip was mighty mad about it 
when I finally turned on my radio, 
but I told him I had my cargo 
ready for delivery and where did 
he want me to put it? So he calmed 
down and gave me the coordinates. 

66{"k F course, I had to take off 
the spin and shift Beulah 
back to the landing deck, and there 
wasn’t any Ionosphere Guard 
around to help me if I got into any 
kind of trouble. So I was mighty 
careful. I put the chains on Beulah 
again, and then set up trip ropes so 
I could cut her loose without get- 



ting inside of reach of that nose of 
hers. Then I ran lines back to the 
first set of ring bolts, so I could drag 
her back, weightless, without any 
trouble. Beulah looked a little un- 
happy, but didn’t make any fuss 
about it all. I started to take spin 
off, giving the orders to the angle 
jets through the computer right 
down in the cargo compartment, 
so the old girl wouldn’t worry about 
where I was. 

“Beulah didn’t squall as her 
weight came off this time. She just 
reached down and tripped loose the 
chains around her ankles. Did I tell 
you that she was mighty clever?” 

I nodded. 

“Well, she started around that 
spin deck after me. I punched into 
the computer the maximum order 
for spin reduction, and started 
around the spin deck to keep away 
from her. Beulah grabbed hold of 
the computer with her nose — for 
support, I guess — when she got 
over there. She yanked the whole 
thing clear off the deck, breaking 
its cable. Crucis lurched once. 

“And I ended up in the compost 
heap. 

“With Beulah way off center, 
and with that last wild burst from 
the jets before they cut off, the 
ship was gyrating in a way that 
made my stomach uneasy. It didn’t 
seem to bother Beulah, though. She 
just wanted to be near me. I got out 
of there fast, and went up onto the 
bridge. 



130 



GALAXY 



‘The main computer was out, of 
course. I couldn’t interrogate the 
auxiliary computer remotely, so I 
had to fly that wobbling ship to a 
stop by the seat of my pants. I did 
it, too. 

“Then I went back to the cargo 
compartment and hauled Beulah 
into the center. She didn’t make 
any more trouble — she was sorry 
for what she had done. 

“The coordinates the Prinkip 
had given me looked almighty close 
to a big pond that I didn’t recall 
having seen before, but I was too 
busy making a landing with mini- 
mum fuel to ask him about it. I 
finally fought her down safely with 
one leg of my tripod actually in the 
pond, and clouds of steam rising 
up around Delta Crucis. I call it a 
pond. But on a normal-size planet 
it would be a good big lake. 

“Anyway, I had made it safely to 
Penguin, and my elephant was 
alive and healthy. I congratulated 
Beulah when I untied her, and 
then I took her outside to meet the 
Prinkip. I think I was a little proud 
of myself, and of Beulah, and of 
Delta Crucis, too.” 

T WAS so stirred by hearing 
-*■ about this successful conclusion 
of Captain Hannah’s mission that 
I shook his hand warmly and or- 
dered a round of drinks for every- 
one in the room. Fortunately, it 
was not very crowded at the time. 

“That’s not quite the end of the 
AN ELEPHANT FOR THE PR 



story,” said the skipper. “You see, 
the Prinkip had built the pond to 
keep Beulah in. He had somehow 
gotten the idea that I was bringing 
him a whale.” 

I looked blank. 

“An Earth mammal. It lives in 
the oceans, and runs to maybe sev- 
enty or eighty tons.” 

I sat down slowly, and then 
made a sudden dive for my con- 
tract for the use of the Delta Crucis. 

The skipper nodded. “I had a 
contingent contract with the Prin- 
kip, too,” he said, “and I hadn’t de- 
livered. I still haven’t figured out 
how to make delivery of a whale, 
but I will some day. 

“And if you’re looking for that 
part of our contract where you 
agree to store any residual cargo I 
may be carrying, it’s all legal and 
binding. Until I get back from haul- 
ing your Gasha root, you’ll have to 
care for one adult female African 
elephant. But I’m sure you’ll get 
to like Beulah as much as I have. 
She’s a mighty clever elephant.” 

I called the waiter over and or- 
dered a beaker of rhial. 

“But you’re lucky at that,” said 
Hannah. “Check subparagraph f of 
paragraph 74 of our contract: In- 
cidental accrual. When Beulah has 
her baby, the little tyke will be all 
yours.” 

Now I know why Captain Han- 
nah drinks rhial in the morning. 

So do I.

SYNOPSIS 

C ornut has only this one problem: 
he keeps trying to kill himself. 
There is no reason for it that he can 
find. Only unhappy people commit 
suicide and Cornut is a busy, produc- 
tive mathematics instructor, specializ- 
ing in the Mnemonics of Number, so 
successful that not only does he have 
a TV class of three million Townies 
but a live one of almost a hundred 
Gownies! The Townies, all 12 bil- 
lion of them, live and eat and work 
bunched together, pressed for room, 
whereas Gownies are privileged to 
attend University — and Cornut is

specially privileged, for he was born 
at University, raised there in the 
most approved trauma-free manner, 
studied and now teaches there. And 
yet nine times in the past seven 
weeks he has nearly killed himself, 
the latest being an attempt to climb 
out of his window, 18 stories above 
the ground, and is saved just barely 
in time by 

Egerd, an undergraduate, whom 
Cornut has drafted into an elaborate 
system of alarms to protect himself 
against suicide. Since the danger is 
greatest when Cornut is waking, 
Egerd’s job is to come into Cornut’s 
room and make sure he is really 
awakened by the synchronized 
alarms. This time, however, Egerd is 
just tardy enough for Cornut to be 
half out of the window, but in time 
to pull him back, and for being in the 
corridor without shaving he is severe- 
ly reprimanded by 

Master Carl, house master, aged 
70, head of the Mathematics Depart- 
ment, and Cornut’s friend. To the 
extent that Master Carl can remain 
interested in anything but math and 
submicrophotography and other such 
preoccupations, he would like to help 
Cornut. But a Field Expedition has 
been ordered by 

St. Cyr, the president of the Univ- 
ersity, a very old, very strange, very 
dictatorial man, to pick up several 
aborigines from an island in the 
Pacific, and even though that means 



leaving the system of safeguards and 
has nothing whatever to do with 
mathematics, Master Carl insists on 
Cornut’s coming along on the Field 
Expedition rather than risk St. Cyr's 
displeasure. Before going, Cornut is 
told by Med Center that others have 
gone through the same baffling proc- 
ess of causeless suicides. Some suc- 
ceeded quickly, others took longer, 
but the very longest on record is ten 
weeks — and Cornut has made nine 
attempts in seven weeks — so his 
maximum life expectancy is 20 days! 
Master Carl urges him to take a wife 
and suggests 

Locille, a pretty undergraduate, 
in love with Cornut, loved by Egerd, 
and Cornut does offer her a marriage 
of convenience — his convenience. 
For something surely has to be done 
to protect him, and, as Master Carl 
argues, what better protection than a 
wife who will be on hand at those 
falling asleep and waking moments? 
On the morning after his marriage, 
Cornut finds he has looked for a 
human alarm clock and received very 
much more. Locille, going to class, 
has asked him to take wake-up pills, 
not only to get to his own class on 
time but to avoid the deadly drowsy 
state. In horror, Cornut discovers that 
he has taken sleepy pills by mistake, 
and as he drifts helplessly toward 
murderous slumber, his bitterness is 
heightened by being caught now 
that he cares.

He snapped: “Be still, man! 
Don’t you like your work here?” 

The assistant audio engineer 
paled. He had been brought up 
on a texas and never stopped 
dreading the day that he might 
have to go back to one. 

It was not really true that the 
humming distracted Master Carl. 
At his age, you either know what 
you are doing or you don’t, and he 
knew. He went on at the precise 
moment his theme began and 
spoke the words he always spoke, 
while his mind was on Cornut, on 
the Wolgren anomaly, on his pri- 
vate investigation of the paranor- 
mal, on — especially on — the 
responses and behavior of each 
individual undergraduate in his 
studio audience. He noted every 
yawn of a drowsy nucleonics ma- 
jor in the far corner; he observed 
with particular care the furtive 
passage of notes from the boy, 
Egerd, to his protege’s — Cor- 
nut’s — new wife, Locille. He did 
not intend to do anything about 
it 

He was grateful to Locille. As 
a good watchdog, she might very 
well save the life of Cornut, the 
only man on the faculty Carl con- 
sidered to have any chance of 
ever replacing himself. 

In five minutes he had con- 
cluded the live portion of his 
lecture and, indulging his own 
harmless desires, left the studio. 
Taped figures danced on the 



screen behind him, singing The 
Ballad of Sets. 

Let S be a number set, then 
progress: 

If, of any two numbers (a 
and b ) in S, 

Their sum is also in the set, 
The set is closed! And so we 
get 

A reproductive set with this 
definition: 

“ The number set S is closed 
by addition /” 

TTE put the class out of his 
mind and eagerly drew a 
sheaf of photographic prints out 
of his briefcase. He had slept 
only restlessly the night before 
and had risen early to work at 
his newest hobby. He had had 
many. He needed many. Carl was 
in no way dissatisfied, could not 
have conceived a world in which 
he would not have been a mathe- 
matician, but it wasn’t all pleas- 
ure to be a towering elder 
statesman in a young man’s 
game. It was a queer fact of 
mathematics that nearly every 
great mathematician had done 
his best work before he was 
thirty. And most of them, like 
Carl, had turned to other curi- 
osities in their later years. 
Someone opened the door, and 
the choral voices reached him: 

If number set M is closed by 
subtraction, 



134 



GALAXY 



A modul is the term for this 
transaction! 

Master Carl turned, frowning 
like ice. Egerd! He demanded ter- 
ribly: “What is a number set 
closed by multiplication?” 

Egerd quailed but said: “It’s 
a ray, Master Carl. It’s in the 
fourth canto. Sir, I want to — ” 
“Closed to addition and sub- 
traction as well?” 

“A ring, sir. Can I speak to 
you a moment?” 

Carl grunted. 

“I did study the lesson, Master 
Carl, as you can see.” 

He would have said more, but 
Carl had not finished being stern. 
“There is no excuse, Egerd, for 
leaving a class without permis- 
sion. You know that. It may seem 
to you that you are able to grasp 
set theory by studying from 
books, no doubt. You are wrong. 
A mathematician must know 
these simple classical facts and 
definitions as well as he knows 
that February has twenty-eight 
days, and in the same way. By 
mnemonics! I assure you that you 
will never become a first-rate 
mathematician by cutting your 
classes.” 

“Yes, sir. That’s it. I want to 
transfer out. As soon as I get 
back from South America, if it’s 
all right with you, sir.” 

Master Carl was horrified. 
This was not a case for disci- 



pline, he saw at once. Carl did 
not consider that the separation 
of Egerd from mathematics 
would be a loss to mathematics. 
It was compassion for the boy 
himself that gave him concern. 

He temporized by handing 
Egerd one of his photographs. 
“See anything?” 

T7GERD was very patient and 
took the time to examine the 
print thoroughly before shaking 
his head. 

“Look at it from this angle, 
Egerd . No?” Master Carl 
sighed and put the photograph 
back on the desk. No, it didn’t 
really look like a star at all. It 
looked like light-struck film, 
botched in developing. 

“Becquerel’s didn’t look any 
better,” he said. “Well. What is 
it you want to transfer to?” 

“Med School, sir. I’ve made up 
my mind.” He added, “You can 
understand why, Master Carl. I 
don’t have much talent for this 
stuff.” 

Carl didn’t understand; he 
would never understand. He had, 
however, some long time before 
that made up his mind that there 
were things about his students 
that didn’t much need under- 
standing. His students had many 
facets; only one concerned him. 
They were like those paper pat- 
terns the soft-headed undergrad- 
uates in Topology played with, 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



135 



hexihexiflexagons, constructions 
that turned up new sides in be- 
wildering variety each time they 
were flexed. 

He said mournfully: “All right. 
I’ll sign your release.” He scowled 
when he saw that Egerd already 
had it filled out and ready for 
him; the boy was too eager. 

The door opened again. 

Master Carl halted with the 
pen in his hand. “Now what?” 
He recognized the man — vague- 
ly — that hanger-on of the De- 
partment of Liberal Arts whose 
name escaped him. 

The man said with agitation: 
“Excuse me. I’m sorry. Name’s 
Farley. I’m Master Cornut’s sex 
writer — ” 

“I have no objection to that. I 
do object to having my privacy 
disturbed.” Although that was 
not quite true, either. Master 
Carl was prude enough (perhaps 
because he was woman-shy 
enough) to feel that the private 
affairs of men and women should 
not be inspired by scripts pro- 
vided by sexwriters or, as they 
were once called, marriage coun- 
selors. He would never have em- 
ployed one, and he was irked 
with Cornut. 

As it turned out, neither had 
Cornut. “I was a wedding pres- 
ent,” Farley explained, “and so 
I went to see Cornut this morn- 
ing with a rough thirty-day draft. 
I don’t use standard forms; I 



believe in personalized counsel- 
ing. So I thought I’d better in- 
terview the male subject right 
away because, as I’m sure you 
know — ” 

Egerd interrupted desperately: 
“Master Carl. Please sign my 
transfer.” 

The expression in his eyes said 
more than his words. The flex- 
agon turned up another side, and 
this time Carl was able to read 
its design. He nodded and wrote 
his name. It was entirely clear 
that Egerd’s reasons for trans- 
ferring away from Locille and 
Master Cornut had nothing to do 
with his talent for mathematics. 

But the sexwriter would not be 
stopped. “Then where is the fe- 
male subject, Master Carl?” he 
demanded. “They said she would 
be here.” 

“Locille? Of course.” A terri- 
ble thought entered Carl’s mind. 
“You mean that something hap- 
pened again? When you went to 
see Cornut, he was — ” 

“Out cold, yes. Almost dead. 
He’s having his stomach pumped 
now, though. They think he’ll be 
all right.” 

WV7HEN they reached Cornut’s 
room, the medic was scan- 
ning a spectrum elaborated for 
him by a portable diagnosticon. 
Cornut himself was unconscious. 
The medic reassured them: 
“Close, but he missed again. How 



136 



GALAXY 



far is he from that ten-week 
record?” 

Carl interrupted frostily: “Can 
you wake him up? Good. Then 
do.” 

The medic shrugged and fished 
for a hypodermic. He slipped the 
piston of the needle into the 
barrel; the faint spray appeared 
over Cornut’s unbroken skin. The 
tiny droplets found their way 
through dermis and epidermis 
and subcutaneous fat and, in a 
moment, Cornut sat up. 

He said clearly: “I had the 
most ridiculous dream.” 

And then he saw Locille and 
his face went alight. That, at 
least, was no dream. Master Carl 
had little tact, but he had enough 
to take the medic and leave the 
two of them there. 

The experience of having one’s 
stomach pumped is not attrac- 
tive. This was Cornut’s third 
time, but he had not come to 
like it; he tasted bile and foul- 
ness, his esophagus had been 
painfully scraped, and the sleepy 
pills had left him with a head- 
ache. 

“I’m sorry,” he said. 

Locille brought him a glass 
and one of the capsules the medic 
had left. He swallowed it and be- 
gan to chuckle. “Lucky Wahl,” 
he said. “You know, if I’d been 
awake when that fellow came in, 
I’d have gone over and puncjied 
Wahl in the head. It was his 



idea — he got half of Anthro- 
pology to chip in to buy us Far- 
ley’s services for a year. As it 
is — I guess Wahl saved my 
life.” 

He got up and began to wan- 
der around. In spite of the taste 
and the head, he was feeling 
rather cheerful, in an unanalyzed 
way. Even the dream, though 
queer, had not been unpleasant. 
Master Carl and Egerd had been 
in it, and so had St. Cyr and the 
woman from South America; but 
so had Locille. 

He paused by his desk. “What’s 
this?” 

It was a neat sheaf of papers 
clipped in a folder on which was 
printed: S. R. Farley, Consultant. 
That was all. Just Consultant. 
He opened it and found the first 
page a cleanly typed set of what 
seemed to be equations. The 
symbols $ and 9 occurred fre- 
quently, along with strokes, dag- 
gers and congruencies which he 
more or less remembered from 
an undergraduate course in sym- 
bolic logic. 

“That’s almost a Boolean no- 
tation,” he said interestedly. “I 
wonder . Say, look at this, 
Locille. Line three. If you sub- 
stitute these three terms from 
the expansion in line four, and 
then — ” 

He stopped. She was blushing. 

But he hadn’t noticed; he was 
suddenly scowling at his desk. 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



137 



“My Wolgren! Where is it?” 

“If you mean the report on 
distributive anomalies you were 
preparing for Master Carl, he 
took it as he went out.” 

“But it isn’t finished!” 

“He didn’t want you working 
on it. Or anything. He wants you 
to take the day off — get away 
from the campus — and he wants 
me to stay with you.” 

TTE stared glumly at the win- 
dow. “Hum.” He made tast- 
ing motions with his lips and ton- 
gue and made a face. “Where is 
there to go, off campus? Do you 
have any ideas?” 

Locille looked a little worried. 
“As a matter of fact,” she said 
diffidently, “I do.” 

At sundown they boarded the 
one-a-day ferry to the texas; 
there was traffic enough from the 
city to the texas, and even from 
the University to the city, but 
between the texas and the Uni- 
versity there was almost none. 
They leaned against the rail as 
the ferry rose, looking down at 
the University’s island, the city 
and the bay. The almost silent 
blades overhead chopped the 
scarlet sunset sky into dots and 
dashes. All they could hear in- 
side the domed deck of the ferry 
was a bass flutter of blades and 
a more-than-soprano hiss of the 
blade-tip jets. 

Locille said abruptly: “I didn’t 



tell you about Roger. My broth- 
er,” she added in a rush. 

Cornut stopped an emotion be- 
fore it had quite got started. 
“What about him?” he asked, re- 
lieved. 

“He isn’t University caliber. 
He might have been, but — when 
Roger was about five years old, 
he was swimming off the texas — 
there was another boy in the 
water, and he dove. They col- 
lided. The — the other boy 
drowned.” She paused, turning to 
look at him. “Roger fractured his 
skull. Ever since then, he’s been 
— his intelligence never devel- 
oped much past that point.” 

Cornut received the informa- 
tion, frowning. 

It was not that he minded a 
stupid brother-in-law; it was only 
that he had never thought of 
there being any brother-in-law at 
all. It had never occurred to Cor- 
nut that marriage involved more 
than two people. 

“He isn’t insane,” Locille said 
worriedly, “just not intelligent.” 

Cornut hardly heard her. He 
was busy trying to cope with 
the thought that there was more 
here than watchdog or love; 
there was something here that 
he had never counted on. It took 
twenty minutes to fly the rest of 
the way to the texas, and it took 
all of that time for Cornut to 
puzzle out the fact that he had 
taken on more than a conveni- 



138 



GALAXY 



ence or a pleasure — he had 
assumed a sort of obligation as 
well. 

^T^HE texas stood in ninety feet 
of water, just over the hori- 
zon from Sandy Hook. It was 
fifteen acres of steel decks, 
twelve levels high, the lowest of 
the levels forty feet above mean 
high water. It was not the fault 
of the designers of the texas that 
“mean high water” was an ab- 
straction, the average distance 
between trough and peak of the 
great swells of the ocean. The 
texas crouched on hundreds of 
metal legs that sank through the 
ooze to the bedrock beneath, and 
it was a target. In storms the 
whitecaps slapped punishingly 
at its underbelly. If there was 
lightning, it was sure to strike 
at the radar beacon on the tower. 

Time was when those radars 
had been the reason for the ex- 
istence of texas towers. That 
time was past; satellite eyes and 
ionosphere-scatter search meth- 
ods had ended their importance. 
But the world had found other 
uses for them. They guided the 
whale-backed submersibles of the 
world’s cargo fleets surfacing over 
the continental shelf to find har- 
bor. They served as mother 
“ships” for the ranging fishery 
fleets in shallow seas. They pro- 
vided living room for tens of 
millions on the American sea- 



board alone. They provided work 
space for nuisance industries — 
the ones that smelled, or were 
loud, or were dangerous. 

Power was free, nearly, on a 
texas. Each hollow leg was slot- 
ted in its lower stretch. The 
waves that came crashing by 
compressed the air in the col- 
umns, valved through a one-way 
exhaust into a pressure tank; 
pneumatic turbines whirred at 
the release vents of the tanks, 
and the texas’ lights and indus- 
tries drew current from those 
turbines. In “good” weather — 
when the waves roared and 
pounded — there was power 
enough to smelt aluminum; the 
ore boats that unloaded the raw 
materials carried away the slag, 
dumping it within sight of the 
texas itself in the unfillable dis- 
posal pit of the ocean. When 
weather was “bad” — when the 
Atlantic was glassy smooth — 
aluminum making stopped for a 
while. But weather was never 
really “bad” for long. 

Locille’s parents lived with her 
brother in a three-room apart- 
ment in the residential area of 
the texas. It was leeward of the 
fisheries, across the texas from 
the aluminum refinery, six levels 
above the generators. Cornut 
thought it horrible. It smelled 
and it was noisy. 

Locille had brought presents. 
A sash for her father, some- 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



139 



thing cosmetic for her mother 
and, Cornut saw with astonish- 
ment, one of the flags of the 
aborigines as a gift for her broth- 
er Roger. It had not occurred to 
Cornut that there should be gifts, 
much less gifts as expensive as 
any aboriginal artifact; the things 
were in great demand as con- 
versation pieces. But he was 
grateful. The flag was a conver- 
sation piece here, too, and he 
needed one. Locille’s mother 
brought out coffee and cakes, and 
Cornut entertained them with 
the Field Expedition to the Pa- 
cific island. 

He did not, however, mention 
the blowing up of the plane he 
was to have been on, his black- 
out by the side of the road in 
the tropical jungle — and he 
could not keep his eyes off Roger. 

T OCILLE’S brother was a huge 
young man, taller than Cor- 
nut, with a pleasant expression 
and dull eyes. He was not offered 
coffee and refused cake; he sat 
there, watching Cornut, fingering 
the worn fabric of his gift, even 
smelling it, rubbing it against his 
face. Cornut found him discon- 
certing. Bar the aboriginals and 
a handful of clinical cases under 
study, there was not one human 
being on the campus with an IQ 
under a hundred and ten, and 
Cornut had no experience of the 
simple-minded. The boy could 



talk — but mostly did not — 
and though he seemed to under- 
stand what Cornut was saying, 
he never changed expression. 

The fact of the matter was 
that Roger didn’t much care what 
Cornut was saying. His whole at- 
tention was taken up with his 
gift. As soon as he thought it 
was proper to do so, he excused 
himself and carried it to his 
room. 

Roger was aware that it was 
very old and came from very far 
away, but that could have been 
something of last week’s, from 
the city just below the horizon; 
he had little memory. What 
Roger thought principally about 
the flag was that it was a pretty 
color. 

He fixed it with magnetic tacks 
to the wall of his room, stood 
back thoughtfully, removed the 
tacks and replaced the flag closer 
to his bed. He stood there look- 
ing at it, because somehow it 
satisfied him to stand and look 
at it. 

It was bright moonlight out- 
side, but there was a fair wind 
sweeping across the long reach 
from Portugal. The waves were 
high; and the pneumatic hammer- 
hammer, and the rattleslam of 
the valves opening and closing 
pounded through the texas, one 
noise reinforcing the other. It 
made it hard for anyone to talk 
in the other room. (Cornut was 



140 



GALAXY 




DRUNKARD'S WALK 



141 




growing more and more hoarse 
and deafened and uneasy.) But 
it didn’t bother Roger. Since the 
day his own crushed skull had 
minced a corner of his brain, 
nothing had really bothered 
Roger. 

He liked the flag. After ten 
minutes of staring at it, lie took 
off the magnets that held it, 
folded it and put it under his 
pillow. Smiling with pleasure, he 
went back into the other room 
to say goodnight to his sister’s 
new husband. 



IX 

1%/f ASTER Carl lighted a do- 
not-disturb sign on his door 
and opened the folding screen 
that hid his little darkroom from 
the casual eyes of the student 
housekeepers. He was not 
ashamed of the hobby that made 
him operate a darkroom; it was 
simply none of their business. 
Carl was not ashamed of any- 
thing he did. His room attested 
to that; it bore the marks of all 
his interests. 

Three boards held chess prob- 
lems half worked out and for- 
gotten, the pieces lifted, dusted 
and replaced by a dozen genera- 
tions of student maids. On the 
walls were framed prints of Min- 
oan scenes and inscriptions, the 
ten-year-old relics of his statisti- 



cal examination into the gram- 
mar of Linear B. A carton that 
had once contained a dozen packs 
of Rhine cards (and still 
contained five unopened packs) 
showed the two years he had 
spent in demonstrating to his 
own satisfaction, once for all, 
that telepathy was not possible. 

The proof rested on an anal- 
ogy, but Master Carl had satisfied 
himself that the analogy was 
valid. If, he supposed, telepathic 
communications could be sub- 
sumed under the general equa- 
tions of Unified Field Law, it 
had to fall into one of the two 
possible categories therein. It 
could be tunable, like the electro- 
magnetic spectrum; or it could 
be purely quantitative, like the 
kineto-gravitic realms. He elimi- 
nated the second possibility at 
once: it implied that every 

thought would be received by 
every person within range, and 
observation denied that on the 
face of it. 

Telepathy, if it existed at all, 
therefore had to be tunable. Carl 
then applied his analogy. Crys- 
tals identical in structure reso- 
nate at the same frequency. 
Humans identical in structure do 
exist; they are called identical 
twins. For two years Master Carl 
had spent most of his free time 
locating, persuading and testing 
pairs of identical twins. 

It took two years, and no more, 



142 



GALAXY 



because that was how long it 
took him to find three hundred 
and twenty-six pairs; and three 
hundred and twenty-six was the 
number the chi-square law gave 
as the minimum universe in 
which a statistical sampling could 
be regarded as conclusive. As 
soon as the three hundred and 
twenty-sixth twin had failed to 
secure significantly more than 
chance correlation with the card 
symbols viewed by his sibling, 
Carl had closed out the experi- 
ment at once. 

When the two-year job was 
ended, Carl was not angry; he 
had simply disproved something. 
It did not occur to him to go on 
to a three hundred and twenty- 
seventh set. He did, however, per- 
mit himself to turn to investiga- 
ting other aspects of what had 
once been called psionics. 

PRECOGNITION he elirni- 
■*- nated on logical grounds. 
Clairvoyance he pondered over 
for several months before decid- 
ing that, like the conjecture that 
flying saucers were of extrater- 
restrial origin, it offered too few 
opportunities for experimental 
verification to be an attractive 
study. Hexing he ruled out as 
necessarily involving either tele- 
pathy or clairvoyance. It was not 
the cases in which the sufferer 
knew he was hexed that offered 
a problem; simple suggestion 



could account for most of those 
— a man who saw the wax doll 
with the pins in it, or was told 
by the ju-ju man that his toenails 
were being roasted, might very 
easily sicken and die out of fear. 
But if the victim did not learn 
of his hex through physical 
means, he could learn only by 
either telepathy or clairvoyance; 
and Carl had eliminated them. 

The traditional list of para- 
normal powers included only 
two other phenomena: Fire-send- 
ing and telekinesis. 

Carl elected to consider the 
first only a subdivision of the 
second. Speeding the Brownian 
movement of molecules (i.e., 
heating them) to the point of 
flame was surely no different in 
kind than gross manipulation of 
groups of molecules (i.e., moving 
material objects). 

His first attempts at telekinesis 
involved a weary time of at- 
tempting to shift bits of matter, 
papers first, then balanced pins, 
hanging threads, finally grains of 
dust on a microbalance. There 
was no result. Co-opting some 
help from Classical Physics, Carl 
then began a series of tests in- 
volving photographic film. It was, 
the drafted physicists assured 
him, the medium in which the 
least physical force produced the 
greatest measurable effect. A 
photon, a free electron, almost 
any particle containing energy 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



143 



could shift the unstable mole- 
cules in the film emulsion. 

Carl worked with higher speed 
emulsions, and higher and higher, 
learning tricks to make the film 
still more sensitive — special de- 
velopers, close temperature con- 
trol, pre-exposing the film to 
“soak up” part of the energy 
necessary to produce an image. 

With each new batch of film, 
he sat for hours, attempting to 
paint circles, crosses and stars on 
the emulsion with his mind, vis- 
ualizing the molecules and will- 
ing the change-over. He scissored 
out stencils and held them over 
the wrapped film packs, consider- 
ing it possible that the mental 
“radiation” might show only as 
a point source. 

He had one temporary and 
illusive success: A plate of par- 
ticularly trigger-happy film, 
wrapped under his pillow all one 
night, developed the next morn- 
ing into a ghostly, wavering “X.” 
Master Florian of Photochemistry 
disillusioned him. Carl had only 
succeeded in so sensitizing the 
film that it reacted to the tiny 
infrared produced by his own 
body heat. 

TV/JASTER Carl’s project for 
-*-*-*- this night involved pre-ex- 
posing a specially manufactured 
batch of X-ray film by means of 
contact with a sheet of lumines- 
cent paper. The faint gamma 



radiation from the paper needed 
hours to affect the emulsion, but 
those hours had to be accurately 
timed. 

To fill the space of those hours, 
Master Carl had another pleas- 
ant task. He sent a student cour- 
ier to his office for the unfinished 
draft he had abstracted from 
Cornut’s room. It was headed: 

A Reconciliation 

Of Certain Apparent Anomalies 
In Wolgren's Distributive Law 

Carl drew a stiff-backed chair 
up to his desk and began to 
read, enjoying himself very 
much. 

Wolgren’s Law, which had to 
do with the distribution of non- 
uniform elements in random pop- 
ulations, was purely a mathema- 
tician’s rule. It did not deal with 
material objects; it did not even 
deal with numerical quantities 
as such. Yet Wolgren’s Law had 
found applications in every sort 
of sampling technique known to 
man, from setting parameters 
for rejecting inferior batches of 
canned sardines to predicting 
election results. It was a general 
law, but the specific rules that 
could be drawn from it had 
proved themselves in nearly 
every practical test. 

In every test but one. 

One of Carl’s graduate stu- 
dents attempted to reconcile the 



144 



GALAXY 



Wolgren rule with census data 
for his doctoral thesis — queerly, 
the subject seemed never to have 
been covered. The boy failed. He 
found another subject, got his 
degree and was now happily de- 
signing communications systems 
for the TV syndicates, but in fail- 
ing he had produced a problem 
worth the attention of a first-rate 
mathematician; and Carl had of- 
fered it to Cornut. 

Cornut had worked on it, in 
his own after-hours time, for six 
months. Incomplete as it was, the 
report gave Master Carl three 
hours of intensive enjoyment. 
Trust Cornut to do a beautiful 
job! 

Carl followed every step, mum- 
bling to himself, cocking an eye- 
brow at the use of chi-squared 
until it was proved by a daring 
extension of Gibbs’ phase-analy- 
sis rule. The mathematical state- 
ment concerned him, not the sub- 
ject of census figures themselves. 

It was only when he had fin- 
ished the report and sat back, 
glowing, that he wondered why 
Cornut had thought it was not 
finished. But it was! Every equa- 
tion checked! The constants were 
standard and correct, the vari- 
ables were pinned down and 
identified with page after page 
of expansions. 

“Very queer,” said Carl to him- 
self, staring vacantly at the bench 
where his X-ray film was quietly 



soaking up electrons. “I wonder 
if — ” 

He shrugged and attempted to 
dismiss the problem. It would not 
be dismissed. He thought for a 
moment of calling in Cornut, but 
stopped himself. The boy would 
not be back from his visit to 
Locille’s family, and even if he 
were, it was no longer in good 
taste to burst in on him. 

Dissatisfied, Master Carl read 
again the last page of the report. 
The math was correct. This time 
he allowed the sense of it to 
penetrate: “Of n births, the at- 
tained age of the oldest member 
of the population shall equal n 
times a constant e-log q.” Well? 
Why not? 

Carl was irritated. He glanced 
at his clock. It was only ten. 

Frowning, he buttoned his jack- 
et and went out, leaving lights 
on, door open, report open on the 
desk . and the X-ray film still 
firmly taped to its gamma-emit- 
ting paper. 

ATO one answered his knock on 

” Cornut’s door, so Master 
Carl, after a moment’s thought, 
pushed it open. The room was 
empty; the couple had not re- 
turned from the texas. 

Carl grumbled at the night- 
proctor and took the elevator 
down to the campus. He thought 
a stroll might help. It was chilly, 
but he scarcely noticed. The q

quantity — was there something 
wrong with that? But its expan- 
sions were all in order. He re- 
called, as clearly as though they 
were imprinted on the wall of 
the Administration Building 
ahead of him, the equations de- 
fining q; he even remembered 
what quantities those equations 
involved. Public health, warfare, 
food supply, a trickily derived 
value for the state of the public 
mind . they had all been in 
the accompanying tabulations. 

“Good night, Carl-san.” 

He stopped, blinking through 
the woven iron fence. He had 
reached the small encampment 
where the aboriginals were 
housed; the captain, whatever 
his name was, had greeted him. 

“I thought you people were off 

— ah — lecturing,” Carl said 
lamely. “On exhibition,” he had 
been about to say. 

“Tomorrow, Carl-san,” said the 
waffle-faced man, offering Carl 
a long, feathered pipe. That had 
been in the briefing; it was a 
peace pipe, a quaint and for some 
reason, to the anthropologists a 
surprising, custom of the island- 
ers. Carl shook his head. The man 

— Carl remembered his name; 
it was Masatura-san — said 
apologetically, “You softspeak 
hard, sir. I smell you coming 
long way yesterday.” 

“Really?” said Carl, not hear- 
ing a word. He was thinking 



about e-log and the validity of 
applying it; but that had been 
all right, too. 

“Softspeak brownie not smell 
good,” the man explained seri- 
ously. 

“No, of course not.” Carl was 
wondering about the values for 
a, the age factor in the final 
equation. 

Tai-i Masatura-san said, grow- 
ing agitated: “Cornut-san smell 
bad also, St. Cyr-san speak. Carl- 
san! Not speak brownie!” 

Master Carl glanced at him. 
“Certainly,” he said. “Good 
night.” 

The tai-i called after him be- 
seechingly, but Carl still did not 
hear; he had realized what it was 
that was unfinished about Cor- 
nut’s report. The numerical val- 
ues had been given for every 
quantity but one. 

It was still early; he did not 
intend to sleep until he had 
that one remaining value . 

/"'’ORNUT, with his arm around 
^ Locille, yawned into the face 
of the red moon that hung over 
the horizon. It was growing very 
late. 

They had had to take the ferry 
to the city and wait to transfer; 
the only direct popper from the 
texas to the city was in mid- 
morning, and Locille’s family had 
no place to put them up. Nor, if 
they had, would Cornut have 



146 



GALAXY 



stayed. He needed time to be- 
come accustomed to domesticity 
— it was too many things at 
once; bad enough that he should 
have to interrupt his routine to 
accommodate Locille’s presence 
in his room. 

But it was, on the whole, worth 
while. 

The University was under 
them now, the cables of the 
bridge lacing the red moon, the 
lights from the Administration 
Building bright in the dark mass 
of towers. 

It was odd that the Administra- 
tion Building should still be 
lighted. 

Drowsily Cornut looked, out 
of the corner of his eye, at the 
neat, sleepy head of his wife. He 
did not know if he liked her 
better or worse as a member of 
a family. Her parents — dull — 
amiable, he supposed, but he was 
used to brilliance. And her broth- 
er was an unfortunate accident, 
of course, but he had been so 
enchanted with the rag Locille 
had brought him, like a child, 
like an animal. Cornut was not 
quite pleased to be related to 
him. Naturally you couldn’t 
choose your relatives. His own 
children, for example, might be 
quite disappointing . 

His own children! 

The thought had come quite 
naturally; bpt he had never had 
that particular thought before. 



Involuntarily he shivered, and 
looked again at Locille. 

She said sleepily, “What’s the 
matter?” And then: “Oh. Why, 
I wonder what they want.” 

The ferry was coming in close, 
and on the hardstand several 
men were waiting patiently, be- 
hind them a police popper, its 
blades still but its official-business 
light winking red. In the flood- 
lights that revealed the landing 
X to the pilot, Cornut recognized 
one of the men, an administration 
staffer; the others all wore uni- 
forms. 

“I wonder,” he said, glad that 
he didn’t have to explain the 
shudder. “Well, I’ll certainly 
sleep tonight.” He took her hand 
and helped her, unnecessarily but 
pleasurably, down the steps. 

A squat uniformed man step- 
ped forward. “Master Cornut? 
Sergeant Rhame. You undoubted- 
ly don’t remember me, but — ” 
Cornut said, “But I do. You 
were in one of my classes. six or 
seven years ago. Master Carl 
recommended you; in fact, he 
was your advocate at the orals 
for your thesis.” 

There was a pause. “Yes, that’s 
right,” said Rhame. “He wanted 
me to apply for the faculty, but 
I’d majored in forensic probabil- 
ities and the Force had already 
accepted me, and — well, that’s 
a long time ago.” 

Cornut nodded pleasantly. 



DRUNKARD’S WALK 



147 



“Nice to see you again, Rhame. 
Good night.” 

T>HAME shook his head. Cor- 
-*-*-nut stopped, a quick, vague 
fear beginning to pulse in his 
mind. No one enjoys the sudden 
knowledge that the policeman 
in front of him wants to discuss 
official business; Rhame’s expres- 
sion told Cornut that that was 
so. 

Cornut said sharply: “What is 
it?” 

Rhame was not enjoying him- 
self. “I’ve been waiting for you. 
It’s about Master Carl; you’re* his 
closest friend, you know. There 
are some questions — ” 

Cornut hardly noticed Locille’s 
sudden, frightened clutching at 
his arm. He stated: “Something’s 
happened to Carl.” 

Rhame spread his hands. “I’m 
sorry. I thought you knew. The 
lieutenant sent word to have you 
called from the texas; you must 
have left before the message got 
there.” He was trying to be kind, 
Cornut saw. “It happened about 
an hour ago, around twelve o’- 
clock. The president had gone 
to bed — St. Cyr, I mean. Master 
Carl came storming into his res- 
idence — very angry, the house- 
keeper said.” 

“Angry about what?” asked 
Cornut in alarm. 

“I was hoping you could tell 
us that. It must have been some- 



thing pretty serious. He tried to 
kill St. Cyr with an axe. Fortu- 
nately — ” He hesitated, but 
could find no way to withdraw 
the word. “As it happened, that 
is, the president’s bodyguard was 
nearby. He couldn’t stop Master 
Carl any other way. He shot 
Master Carl to death.” 

X 

/^ORNUT went through that 
^ night and the next day in 
confusion. It was all very simple, 
everything was made easy for 
him, but it was impossibly hard 
to take. Carl dead! The old man 
shot down — attempting to com- 
mit a murder! It was more than 
unbelievable, it was simply fan- 
tastic. Cornut' could not admit 
its possibility for a second. 

But he could not deny that it 
had happened. 

Locille was with him almost 
every moment, closer than a wife, 
even closer than a watchdog. He 
didn’t notice she was there. But 
he would have noticed if she 
were missing. It was as though 
she had always been there, all 
his life, because his life was now 
something radically new, differ- 
ent, something that had begun 
at one o’clock in the morning, 
stepping out of a ferry popper 
to see Sergeant Rhame. 

Rhame had asked him all the 
necessary questions in a quarter 



148 



GALAXY 



of an hour, but he had not left 
him then. It was charity, not 
duty, that kept him. A policeman, 
even a forensic probabilistician 
detailed to Homicide at his own 
personal request, is used to vio- 
lence and unlikely murderers, 
and can sometimes help explain 
difficult facts to the innocent by- 
standers. He tried. Cornut was 
not grateful. He was only dazed. 

He canceled his classes for the 
next day — tapes would do — 
and accompanied Rhame on a 
laborious retracing of Carl’s last 
moves. First they visited St. Cyr’s 
residence and found the presi- 
dent awake and icy. He did not 
seem shaken by his experience; 
but then he never did. 

He gave them only a moment 
of his time. “Carl — a kill-er. It 
is a great shock, Cor-nut. Ge-ni- 
us, we can-not ex-pect it to be 
sta-ble, I sup-pose.” 

Cornut did not want to linger. 
St. Cyr’s presence was never at- 
tractive, but the thing that re- 
pelled him about the interview 
was the sight of the 15th century 
halberd replaced on the floor 
where, they said, Master Carl 
had dropped it as the gunman 
shot him down. The pile of the 
carpet there was crisper, cleaner 
than the rest. Cornut was sickly 
aware that it had been washed, 
and aware what stain had been 
so quickly dissolved away. 

He was glad to be out of the 



president’s richly furnished resi- 
dence, though the rest of the day 
was also no joy. Their next stop 
was the night-proctor on Carl’s 
floor, who confirmed that the 
house master had left at about 
ten o’clock, seeming disturbed 
about something but, in his nat- 
ural custom, giving no clue as 
to its nature to an undergradu- 
ate. Because it did not occur to 
them to question the aboriginals, 
they did not learn of his brief 
and entirely one-sided conversa- 
tion, but they picked up his trail 
at the next point. 

11/f ASTER Carl had turned up 
at the Stacks at twenty-five 
minutes past ten, demanding in- 
stant service from the night li- 
brarian. 

The librarian was a student, 
working off part of his tuition, 
as most students did. He was em- 
barrassed and Cornut quickly de- 
duced why. “You were asleep, 
weren’t you?” 

The student nodded, hanging 
his head. The news of Master 
Carl’s death had reached every 
night clerk on the campus, and 
the boy had been unable to get 
to sleep. “He gave me five de- 
merits and — ” He stopped, sud- 
denly angry with himself. 

“Consider them canceled,” Cor- 
nut said kindly. “You’re quite 
right in telling us about the 
demerits, however. Sergeant 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



149 



Rhame needs all the informa- 
tion.” 

“Thank you, Master Cornut. I 
— uh — I also didn’t have a 
chance to get the ashtray off 
my desk, and he noticed it. But 
he just said he wanted to use 
the Stacks.” The undergraduate 
waved toward the great air-con- 
ditioned hall where the taped 
and microfilmed University Li- 
brary was kept. The library com- 
puter was served by some of the 
same circuits as the Student Test- 
Indices (College Examinations) 
Digital Computer on the level 
above it; all the larger computers 
on the campus were cross-hooked 
to some degree. 

Rhame was staring at the lay- 
out. “It’s got more complicated 
since I was here,” he said. “Did 
Master Carl know how to use 
it?” 

The student grinned. “He 
thought he did. Then he came 
storming back to me. He couldn’t 
get the data he wanted. So I 
tried to help him — but it was 
classified data. Census figures.” 
“Ah,” said Cornut. 

Sergeant Rhame turned and 
looked at him. “Ah what?” 

Cornut said, “I think I know 
what he was after, that’s all. It 
was the Wolgren.” 

Rhame understood what he 
was talking about — fortunately, 
for it had not occurred to Cornut 
that anyone would fail to be 



aware of Wolgren’s Distributive 
Law. Rhame said, “I only use 
some special Wolgren functions. 
I don’t see exactly what it has to 
do with census figures.” 

Cornut sat down, beginning to 
lecture. Without looking, he put 
out his hand and Locille, still 
with him, took it. “It’s not im- 
portant to what you’re looking 
for. Anyway, I don’t think it is. 
We had a question up for study 
— some anomalies in the Wol- 
gren distribution of the census 
figures — and, naturally, there 
shouldn’t be any anomalies. So 
I took it as a part-time project.” 

TTE frowned. “I thought I had 
it beaten, but I ran into 
trouble. Some of the values de- 
rived from my equations turned 
out to be ridiculous. I tried to 
get the real values, but I got the 
same answer as Master Carl — 
they were classified. Silly, of 
course.” 

The student librarian chimed 
in, “He said moronic. He said he 
was going to take it up with the 
Saint — ” He stopped, blushing. 

Rhame said, “Well, I guess he 
did. What were the values that 
bothered you?” 

Cornut shook his head. “Not 
important; they’re wrong. Only 
I couldn’t find my mistake. So 
I kept going over the math. I 
suppose Carl went through the 
same thing, and then decided to 



150 



GALAXY 



take a look at the real values 
in the hope that they’d give some 
clue, just as I did.” 

“Let’s take a look,” said 
Rhame. The student librarian 
led them to the library computer, 
but Cornut nodded him aside. He 
set up the integrals without any 
assistance. 

“Age values,” he explained. 
“Nothing of any great impor- 
tance. No reason it should be a 
secret. But — ” 

He finished with the keyboard 
and indicated the viewer of the 
screen. It flickered and then 
bloomed with a blunt legend: 

CLASSIFIED 

INFORMATION 

Rhame stared at the words. He 
said, “I don’t know.” 

“I can’t believe it, either. True, 
Carl was a house master. He felt 
he had certain rights . .” 

The policeman nodded. “What 
about it, son? Did he act pecu- 
liar?” 

“He was mad as hell,” said the 
student librarian. “He said he was 
going right over to the S — to 
the president’s residence and get 
clearance to receive the data. 
Said it was moronic — let’s see 
— ‘moronic, incompetent bu- 
reaucracy,’ ” he finished with 
satisfaction. 

Sergeant Rhame looked at 
Cornut. “Well, the inquest will 



have to decide,” he said after a 
moment. 

“Do you think he would try 
to kill a man because of anything 
like this?” Cornut demanded 
harshly. 

“Master Cornut,” said the 
policeman slowly, “I don’t think 
anybody ever really wants to kill 
anybody. But he blew his top. If 
he was angry enough, who 
knows?” He didn’t give Cornut a 
chance to debate the matter. “I 
guess that’s all,” he said, turning 
back to the night librarian. “Un- 
less he said anything else?” 

The student hesitated, then 
grinned faintly. “Just one other 
thing. As he was leaving, he gave 
me ten more demerits for smok- 
ing on duty.” 

r T'HE following morning Cornut 
was summoned to the chan- 
cellor’s office to hear the reading 
of Carl’s will. 

Cornut was only mildly sur- 
prised to find that he was Mas- 
ter Carl’s sole heir. He was 
touched, however. And he was 
saddened, for Master Carl’s own 
voice told him about it. 

That was the approved way 
of recording the most important 
documents, and it was like Mas- 
ter Carl to believe that the dis- 
position of his tiny estate was 
of great importance. It was a tape 
of his image that recited the 
sonorous phrases: “Being of 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



151 



sound and disposing mind, I de- 
vise and bequeath unto my dear 
friend, Master Cornut — ” 

Cornut sat blinking at the 
image. It was entirely lifelike. 
That, of course, was the point; 
papers could be forged and sound 
tapes could be altered, but there 
was no artisan in the world who 
could quite succeed in making a 
change in a video tape without 
leaving a trace. The voice was 
the voice that had boomed out 
of millions of student television 
sets for decades. 

Watching, Cornut hardly lis- 
tened to the words but found 
himself trying to tell when it was 
that Carl had made the decision 
to leave him all his worldly 
goods. The cloak, he recalled 
vaguely, was an old one; but 
when was it Carl had stopped 
wearing it? 

It didn’t matter. Nothing mat- 
tered about Master Carl, not any 
more; the tape rattled and flap- 
ped off the reel, and the picture 
of Master Carl vanished from 
the screen. 

Locille’s hand touched his 
shoulder. 

The chancellor said cheerfully, 
“Well, that’s it. All yours. Here’s 
the inventory.” 

Cornut glanced over it rapidly. 
Books, more than a thousand 
of them, value fixed by the ap- 
praisers (they must have been 
working day and night!) at five 



hundred dollars and a bit. Cloth- 
ing and personal effects — Cor- 
nut involuntarily grinned — an 
arbitrary value of $1. Cash on 
hand, a shade over a thousand 
dollars, including the money in 
his pocket when he died. Equity 
in the University pension plan, 
$8,460; monthly salary due, cal- 
culated to the hour of death, 
$271; residuals accruing from 
future use of taped lectures, esti- 
mated, $500. Cornut winced. 
Carl would have been hurt by 
that, but it was true; there was 
less and less need for his old 
tapes, with newer professors us- 
ing newer techniques. And there 
was an estimate of future royal- 
ties to be earned by his mnemon- 
ic songs, and that was unkindest 
of all: $50. 

/^ORNUT did not bother to 
^ read the itemized liabilities 
— inheritance tax, income tax, 
miscellaneous bills. He only noted 
the net balance was a shade over 
$ 8 , 000 . 

The funeral director walked 
silently from the back of the 
room and suggested, rather hand- 
somely, “Call it eight thousand 
even. Satisfactory? Then sign 
here, Master Cornut.” 

“Here” was at the bottom of 
a standard mortuary agreement, 
with the usual fifty-fifty split be- 
tween the heirs and the morti- 
cian. Cornut signed quickly, with 



152 



GALAXY 



a feeling of slight relief. He was 
getting off very lightly. With 
cemetery space at such a pre- 
mium, the statutory minimum 
fee for a basic funeral was $2500. 
If the estate had been less than 
$5,000, he would have inherited 
only the balance above $2500. 
If it had been under $2500, he 
would have had to make up the 
difference. That was the law. 
More than one beneficiary, legal- 
ly responsible for funeral expen- 
ses, had regretted the generous 
remembering of the deceased. 
(In fact, there were paupers in 
the world who sold their wills 
as an instrument of revenge on 
occasion. For food, drink, cloth- 
ing, or whatever, they would be- 
queath their paltry all to the 
benefactor’s worst enemy, who 
would then, sooner or later, find 
himself saddled with an inescap- 
able $2500 cost.) 

Sergeant Rhame was waiting 
for them outside the chancellor’s 
office. “Do you mind?” he asked 
politely, holding out his hand. 
Cornut handed over the mortu- 
ary agreement, containing the 
inventory of Carl’s estate. The 
policeman studied it thoughtful- 
ly, then shook his head. “Not 
much money, but he didn’t need 
much, did he? It doesn’t help ex- 
plain anything.” He glanced at 
his watch. “I’ll walk over with 
you. Were due right now at the 
inquest.” 



AS a tribute to the University 
•^^the state medical examiner 
had impaneled a dozen faculty 
members as his jury. Only one 
was from the Mathematics De- 
partment, a woman professor 
named Janet, but Cornut dimly 
recognized several of the others 
from faculty teas and walks on 
the campus. 

St. Cyr testified, briefly and in 
his customary uninflected pendu- 
lum-tick voice, that Master Carl 
had shown no previous signs of 
insanity but had been wild and 
threatening indeed the night of 
his death. 

St. Cyr’s housekeeper testified 
the same, adding that she had 
feared for her own life. 

The bodyguard who killed 
Carl took the stand. Cornut felt 
Locille shrink in the seat beside 
him; he understood; he felt the 
same revulsion. The man did not 
seem much different from other 
men, though. He was middle- 
aged, husky, with a slight speech 
impediment. 

He stated that he had been 
in President St. Cyr’s employ for 
nearly ten years; that he had 
once been a policeman and that 
it was not uncommon for very 
wealthy men to hire ex-police- 
men as bodyguards; and that he 
had never before had to kill any- 
one in defense of St. Cyr’s life. 
“But this one. He was dangerous. 
He was . going to kill . 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



153 



somebody.” He got the words 
out slowly, but without appearing 
particularly concerned. 

Then there were a few others 
— Cornut himself, the night- 
proctor, the student librarian, 
even the sexwriter, Farley, who 
said that Master Carl had indeed 
seemed agitated on his one per- 
sonal contact with him but, of 
course, the occasion had been a 
disturbing one — Farley had 
told him of Master Cornut’s most 
recent suicide attempt. Cornut 
attempted to ignore the faces 
that turned toward him. 

The verdict took five minutes: 
“Killed in self-defense, in the 
course of attempting to commit 
murder.” 

For days after that, Cornut 
kept away from St. Cyr’s resi- 
dence, for the sake of avoiding 
Carl’s executioner. He had never 
seen the man before Carl was 
killed and never wanted to see 
him again. 

But as time passed, Carl’s 
death dwindled in his mind; his 
own troubles, more and more, 
filled it. He began to approach, 
then reached, finally passed the 
all-time record for suiciders. 

TTE was still alive because of 
the endless patience and 
watchfulness of Locille. Every 
night she watched him go to 
sleep; every morning she was up 
before him. 



She began to look pale, and 
he found her taking catnaps in 
the dressing room while he was 
lecturing to his classes, but she 
did not complain. 

She also did not tell him, until 
he found the marks and guessed, 
that twice in one week, even with 
her alert beside him, he had 
nearly severed his wrists, first 
on a letter opener, second on a 
broken drinking tumbler. When 
he chided her for not telling him, 
she kissed him. That was all. 

He was having dreams, too, 
queer ones; he remembered them 
sharply when he woke, and for a 
while told them to Locille, and 
then stopped. They were very 
peculiar. They had to do with 
being watched — being watched 
by some gruff, irritated warden, 
or by a hostile Roman crowd 
waiting for his blood in the 
arena. 

They were unpleasant and he 
tried to analyze them by him- 
self. It was because he was sub- 
consciously aware of Locille 
watching him, he told himself; 
and in the next breath said, Par- 
anoia. He did not believe it . 
but what then? 

He considered returning to his 
analyst, but when he broached it 
to Locille, she only looked paler 
and more strained. Some of the 
sudden joy had gone out of their 
love, and that worried Cornut, 
and it did not occur to him that 



154 



GALAXY 



the building of trust and solid- 
arity between them was perhaps 
worth more. 

But not all the joy had gone. 
Apart from interludes of passion, 
somewhat constrained by Lo- 
cille’s ironclad determination to 
stay awake until he was fully 
asleep, apart from the trust and 
closeness, there were other 
things. There was the interest of 
work shared, for as Cornut’s wife 
Locille became more his pupil 
than ever before in one of his 
classes; together they rechecked 
the Wolgren, found it correct, 
shelved it for lack of confirming 
data and began a new study of 
prime distribution in very large 
numbers. They were walking 
back to the Math Tower one 
warm day, planning a new ap- 
proach through analytic use of 
the laws of congruence, when 
Locille stopped and caught his 
arm. 

Egerd was coming toward 
them. 

He was tanned, but he did not 
look well. Part of it was for rea- 
sons Cornut had only slowly 
come to know; he was uncom- 
fortable in the presence of the 
girl he loved and the' man she 
had married. But there was 
something else. He looked sick. 

Locille was direct: “What in 
the world’s the matter with 
you?” 

Egerd grinned. “Don’t you 



know about Med School? It’s 
traditional, hazing freshmen. The 
usual treatment is a skin fungus 
that turns sweat rancid, so you 
stink, or a few drops of some- 
thing that makes you break out 
in orange blotches, or — well, 
never mind. Some of the jokes 
are kind of, uh, personal.” 

Locille said angrily: “That’s 
terrible! It isn’t a bit funny to 
me, Egerd!” 

Cornut said to her, after Egerd 
had left, “Boys will be boys.” 
She looked at him swiftly. Cor- 
nut knew his tone had been cal- 
lous. He didn’t know that she 
understood why; he thought his 
sudden sharp stab of jealousy 
had been perfectly concealed. 

A LITTLE over two weeks af- 
ter Master Carl’s death, the 
proctor knocked on Cornut’s 
door to say that he had a visitor. 
It was Sergeant Rhame, with a 
suitcase full of odds and ends. 
“Master Carl’s personal effects,” 
he said. “They belong to you 
now. Naturally, we had to bor- 
row them for examination.” 

Cornut shrugged. The stuff 
was of no great value. He poked 
through the suitcase; some shab- 
by toilet articles, a book marked 
Diary — he flipped it open hope- 
fully, but it recorded only de- 
merits and class attendances — an 
envelope containing photograph- 
ic film. 



DRUNKARD'S WALK

Sergeant Rhame said: “That’s 
what I wanted to ask you about. 
He had a lot of photographic 
equipment. We found several 
packs of film, unopened, which 
Master Carl had pressed against 
some kind of radiation-emitting 
paint on a paper base. The lab 
spent a lot of time trying to fig- 
ure it out. They guessed he was 
trying to get the gamma radia- 
tion from the paint to register 
on the film, but we don’t know 
why.” 

Cornut said: “Neither do I, but 
I can make a guess.” He told 
Rhame about Carl’s off-duty in- 
terests, and the endless laborious 
work that he had been willing to 
put into them. “I’m not sure what 
his present line was, but I know 
it had something to do with try- 
ing to get prints of geometrical 
figures — stars, circles, that sort 
of thing. Do you mean he finally 
succeeded in getting one?” 

“Not exactly.” Sergeant 
Rhame opened the package and 
handed Cornut a glossy print. 
“All the negatives were blank ex- 
cept one. This one. Make any- 
thing of it?” 

Cornut studied it. It seemed to 
be a photograph of a sign or a 
printer’s proof. He puzzled over 
it for a while, then shook his 
head. 

The lettering on the print said 
simply: 

YOU DAMN OLD FOOL 



nHHE wind was brisk, and the 
stretched cables under the 
texas made a bull-roarer sound 
as they vibrated. The pneumatic 
generators rattled, whined and 
crashed. Locille’s brother was too 
used to them to notice. 

He was feeling rather poorly, 
but it was his custom to do what 
his parents expected him to do, 
and they expected that he would 
watch the University broadcasts 
of his sister’s classes. The present 
class was Cornut’s, and Roger 
eyed with polite ignorance the 
professor’s closely reasoned ex- 
position of Wilson’s Theorem. 
He watched the dancing girls 
and the animated figures with 
more interest, but it was, on the 
whole, a disappointing show. The 
camera panned the studio audi- 
ence only twice, and in neither 
case was he able to catch a 
glimpse of Locille. 

He reported to his mother, 
took his last look at the flag 
Locille had brought him, and 
went to work. 

As the day wore on, Roger felt 
worse. First it was his head 
pounding, then his bones aching, 
then an irresistible sudden nau- 
sea. Roger’s job was conducive 
to that; he spent the whole day 
standing thigh-deep in a smelly 
fluid composed of salt water, fish 
lymph and blood. 



156 



GALAXY 



Ordinarily it didn’t bother him 
(as nothing much bothered him, 
anyhow). Today was different. 
He steadied himself with one 
hand against a steel-topped 
table, shook his head violently 
to clear it. He had just come 
back from a hasty trip to the 
washroom, where he had vom- 
ited. Now it seemed he was close 
to having to race out there again. 

Down the table, the sorter 
called: “Roger! Hey! You’re 

holding up the works.” 

Roger rubbed the back of his 
neck and mumbled something 
that was not intelligible, even to 
himself. He got back to work be- 
cause he had to; the fish were 
piling up. 

It was the sorter’s job to sep- 
arate the females of the stocked 
Atlantic salmon run from the 
males. The male fish were thrust 
down a chute to a quick and 
undistinguished death. But the 
females, in breeding season, con- 
tained something too valuable 
to be wasted on the mash of en- 
trails and bony parts that made 
dry fish meal. That was Roger’s 
job — Roger’s and a few dozen 
others who stood at tables just 
like his. 

The first step was to grasp the 
flopping female by the tail with 
one hand and club her brains 
out. The second was to hold her 
with both hands, exposing her 
belly to his partner across the 



table, whose knift ripped open 
the egg sac inside. (Sometimes 
the knife missed. Roger’s job 
was not sought after.) A quick 
wringing motion; the eggs poured 
one way, the gutted body slid 
another, and he was ready for 
the next fish. Even the ‘dullest 
grew to dislike the work. Roger 
had held the same job for four 
years. 

“Come on, Roger!” the sorter 
was yelling at him again. 

Roger stared at him woozily. 
For the first time he became 
suddenly aware of the constant 
slam, bang, rattle, roar that per- 
meated the low-level fishery 
plant. He opened his mouth to 
say something, and then he ran. 
He made it to the washroom, 
but just barely in time. 

A N hour later, his mother was 
astonished to see him home. 
“What happened?” 

He tried to relate everything 
that had happened, but it involv- 
ed some complicated words. He 
settled for: “I didn’t feel good.” 
She was worried. Roger was 
always healthy. He didn’t look 
good, ever, but that was because 
the part of his brain that was 
damaged had something to do 
with his muscle tone; but in fact 
he had been sick hardly a week’s 
total in his life. 

She said doubtfully: “Your 

father will be home in an hour 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



157 



or so, but maybe I ought to call 
him. I wonder. What do you 
think, Roger?” 

That was rhetoric; she had 
long since reconciled herself to 
the fact that her son did not 
think. He stumbled and straight- 
ened up, scowling. The back of 
his neck was beginning to pain 
badly. He was in no mood to 
contemplate hard questions. 
What he wanted was to go to 
bed, with Locille’s flag by his 
pillow, so that he could fondle 
it drowsily before he slept. That 
was what he liked. He told his 
mother so. 

She was seriously concerned 
now. “You are sick. I’d better 
call the clinic. You go lie down.” 

“No. No, you don’t have to. 
They called at the place.” He 
swallowed with some pain; he 
was beginning to shiver. “Mr. 
Garney took me to the dia — 
the dia — ” 

“The diagnosticon at the clin- 
ic, Roger.” 

“Yes, and I got some pills.” 
He reached in his pocket and 
held up a little box. “I already 
took one and I have to take 
some more later.” 

His mother was not satisfied, 
but she was no longer very wor- 
ried; the diagnostic equipment 
did not often fail. “It’s that cold 
water you stand in,” she said, 
helping him to his room. “I’ve 
told you, Roger, ' you ought to 



have a better job. Sheer, maybe 
even sorter. Or maybe you can 
get out of that part of it alto- 
gether. You’ve worked there 
enough years . .” 

“Good night,” Roger said in- 
appropriately — it was early 
afternoon. He began to get ready 
for bed, feeling a little better in 
the familiar, comfortable room 
with his familiar, comfortable 
bed and the little old Japanese 
flag wadded up by the pillow. 
“I’m going to sleep now,” he told 
her, and got rid of her at last. 

He huddled under the warm- 
ing covers — set as high as the 
rheostat would go, but still not 
high enough to warm his shaking 
body. The pain in his head was 
almost blinding now. 

At the clinic, Mr. Garney had 
been painfully careful to explain 
what the pills were for. They 
would take away the pain, stop 
the throbbing, make him com- 
fortable, let him sleep. Feverish- 
ly Roger shook another one out 
of the box and swallowed it. 

It worked, of course. The clin- 
ic’s pills always performed as 
advertised. The pain dwindled 
to a bearable ache, then to a 
memory. The throbbing stopped. 

Roger felt drowsily peaceful. 
He could not see his face and 
therefore did not know how 
flushed it was becoming. He had 
no idea that his temperature was 
climbing rapidly. He went quite 



158 



GALAXY 



happily to sleep — with the old, 
frayed flag against his cheek — 
just as he had done for nearly 
three weeks now, and as he 
would never in this life do again. 

f T'HE reason Roger hadn’t seen 
his sister in the audience was 
that she wasn’t there; she was 
waiting in Cornut’s little dressing 
room. Cornut suggested it. “You 
need the rest,” he said solicitous- 
ly, and promised to review the 
lesson with her later. 

Actually he had another mo- 
tive entirely. As soon as he was 
off the air, he wrote a note for 
Locille and gave it to a student 
to deliver: 

There’s something I have to 
do. I’ll be gone for a couple of 
hours. I promise I'll be all right. 
Don’t worry. 

Before the note reached her, 
Cornut was at the bridge, in the 
elevator, on his way to the city. 

He did have something to do 
and he did not want to talk to 
Locille about it. The odd dreams 
had been worsening, and there 
had been other things. He nearly 
always had a hangover now, for 
instance. He had found that a 
few drinks at night made him 
sleep better and he had come 
to rely on them. 

And there was something else 
about which he could not talk 



to Locille at all because she 
would not talk. 

The monotrack let him out 
far downtown, in a bright, noisy, 
stuffy underground station. He 
paused at a phone booth to 
check the address of the sex- 
writer, Farley, and hurried up 
to street level, anxious to get 
away from the smell and noise. 
That was a mistake. In the open, 
the noise pounded more furious- 
ly, the air was even more foul. 
Great cubical blocks of buildings 
rose over him; small three- 
wheeled cars and large commer- 
cial vehicles pounded on two 
levels around him. It was only 
a minute’s walk to Farley’s office, 
but the minute was an ordeal. 

The sign on the door was the 
same as the lettering on his 
folder: 

S. R. Farley 
Consultant 

The sexwriter’s secretary 
looked very doubtful, but finally 
reported that Mr. Farley would 
be able to see Master Cornut 
without an appointment. 

Cornut went in, sat across the 
desk, refused a cigarette and said 
directly: “I’ve studied the sample 
scripts you left for us, Farley. 
They’re interesting, though I 
don’t believe I’ll require your 
services in future. I think I’ve 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



159 



grasped the notation, and I find 
that there is one page of con- 
stants which seems to describe 
the personality of my wife and 
myself.” 

“Oh, yes. Very important,” 
said Farley. “Yours is incom- 
plete — I had no real opportun- 
ity to interview you — but I 
secured your personnel-file data, 
the profile from the Med Center 
and so on.” 

“Good. Now I have a question 
to ask you.” 

Cornut hesitated. The proper 
way to ask the question was to 
say: “I suspect, from a hazy, 
sleepy recollection, that the other 
morning I made a rather odd 
suggestion to my wife.” That was 
the proper way, but it was em- 
barrassing, and it also involved 
a probability of having to reveal 
how many rather odd things he 
had done, some of them nearly 
fatal, in those half-waking mo- 
ments . 

“Let me borrow a piece of 
paper,” he said instead, and rap- 
idly sketched in a line of sym- 
bols. Stating the problem in 
terms of $ and 9 made it 
vastly less embarrassing. He 
shoved it across the desk to the 
sexwriter. “What would you say 
to this? Does it fit in with your 
profile of our personalities?” 

Farley studied the line and 
raised his eyebrows. “Absolutely 
not!” he said. “You wouldn’t 



think of it and she wouldn’t ac- 
cept it!” 

“You could say it was an ob- 
jectionable thing?” 

“Master Cornut! Don’t use 
moralistic terms! What is cus- 
tomary and moral in one place 
is—” 

“Please, Mr. Farley. In terms 
of our own personalities — you 
have them sketched out on the 
profile — this would be objection- 
able?” 

The sexwriter laughed. “More 
than that, Master Cornut. It 
would be absolutely impossible.” 
Cornut took a deep breath. 
“But suppose,” he said after a 
moment, “I told you that I had 
proposed this to my wife.” 

Farley drummed his fingers 
on the desk. “Then I can only 
say that other factors are in- 
volved.” 

“Like what?” 

Farley said seriously: “You 
must be trying to drive her away 
from you.” 

TN the two blocks between Far- 
ley’s office and the monotrack 
station entrance, Cornut saw 
three men killed; a turbotruck 
on the upper traffic level seemed 
to stagger, grazed another vehi- 
cle and shot through the guard 
rail, killing its driver and two 
pedestrians. 

It was a shocking interpola- 
tion of violence into Cornut’s 



160 



GALAXY 



academic life, but it seemed 
quite in keeping with the rest 
of his day. His own life was 
rapidly going as badly out of 
control as the truck. 

You must be trying to drive 
her away from you. 

Cornut boarded his train, 
hardly noticing, thinking hard. 
He didn’t want to drive Locille 
away! 

But he also did not want to 
kill himself, and yet there was 
no doubt that he had kept try- 
ing. It was all part of a pattern 
and there could be no doubt of 
its sum: He was trying to de- 
stroy himself in every way. Fail- 
ing to end his life, that destroyer 
inside himself was trying to end 
the part of his life that had 
grown to mean most to him, his 
love for Locille. And yet it was 
the same thing really, he 
thought, for with Locille gone, 
Carl dead, Egerd transferred, he 
would have no one close to him 
to help him through the danger- 
ous half-awake moments that 
came at least twice in every 
twenty-four hours. 

He would not last a day. 

He slumped back into his seat, 
with the first sensation of despair 
he had ever felt. One part of his 
mind said judgmatically: “It’s 

too bad.” 

Another part entirely was tak- 
ing in his surroundings. Even 
in his despair, the novelty of be- 



ing among so many non-Univer- 
sity people made an impression. 
They seemed so tired and angry, 
he thought abstractedly; one or 
two even looked sick. He won- 
dered if any of them had ever 
known the helplessness of being 
under siege from the most in- 
sidious enemy of all, himself. 

But suppose Master Carl was 
right after all, said Cornut to 
himself, quite unexpectedly — 
what if he was right? 

The thought startled Cornut. 
It came through without pre- 
amble, and if there had been a 
train of rumination that caused 
it, he had forgotten its existence. 
Right? Right about what? 

The PA system murmured 
that the next stop was his. Cor- 
nut got up absently, thinking. 
Right? 

He had doubted that Master 
Carl had really tried to kill St. 
Cyr. But the evidence was 
against Carl. The police lab had 
verified his fingerprints on the 
axe, and they could not have 
been deceived. 

So suppose Carl really had 
picked up the weapon to split 
the old man’s skull. Incredible! 
But if he had . and if Carl had 
not merely gone into an aber- 
rated senile rage . 

Why, then, said Cornut to 
himself, emerging from the ele- 
vator at the base of the bridge 
pier and blinking at the familiar

campus, perhaps he had a rea- 
son. Perhaps St. Cyr needed 
killing. 

XII 

"CENTERING the room was like 
being plunged under the sur- 
face of the sea. The lights were 
blue-green, concealed and re- 
flecting from blue-green walls. 
A spidery mural of blue and 
green lines covered one wall like 
a wave pattern. From boxes 
along the floor, great curving 
branches of pale plants from the 
hybridization farms rose, resem- 
bling the kelp of the mermaid 
forests. 

The pelagic motif was not a 
matter of design; it was only 
that these shapes and these 
colors were the ones that most 
pleased and comforted President 
St. Cyr. This was his room. Not 
his study, with its oak panels 
and ancient armor; not even the 
“private” drawing room where 
he sometimes entertained mem- 
bers of the faculty. This was the 
room he reserved for a very, very 
few. 

Four of these few were pres- 
ent now. A fat man, gross arms 
quivering, turned himself around 
and said, “When?” He said, “Do 
you want us all?” He said, 
“That’s Jillson’s job.” 

St. Cyr grinned and, after a 
moment, his bodyguard said, 



“No, I don’t. Really. You enjoy 
it more than I do.” 

A woman in a preposterously 
young frock opened her thin- 
lipped mouth and cackled hilari- 
ously when there was a knock 
on the door. 

Jillson, the bodyguard, opened 
it and revealed St. Cyr’s thin, 
silent housekeeper with Master 
Cornut. 

St. Cyr, on a turquoise wing 
chair, raised a hand. Jillson took 
Master Cornut by the arm and 
led him in, the door behind him 
closing on the housekeeper. 

“Mas-ter Cor-nut,” said St. Cyr 
in his odd, uninflected voice. “I 
have been wait-ing for you.” 

The old woman in the young 
dress laughed shrilly for no visi- 
ble reason. The bodyguard 
smiled. The fat man chuckled. 

Cornut could not help, even 
then, looking around this room 
where he had never been. It was 
cool — the air was kept a full 
dozen degrees under the usual 
room temperature Cornut liked. 
There was a muted muttering of 
music in the background, too low 
to distinguish a tune. And these 
people — were odd. 

He ignored Jillson, the assas- 
sin of Master Carl, whom he 
remembered from the inquest. 
The fat man blinked at him. 
“Sen-a-tor Dane,” said St. Cyr. 
“And Miss May Kerbs.” 

Miss May Kerbs was the one 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



163 



who had laughed. She swayed 
over to Cornut, looking like a 
teen-age girl in her first party 
formal. 

“We were talking about you,” 
she said shrilly, and Cornut, with 
a physical shock, recognized that 
this was no teenager. 

CHE suddenly resembled the 
^ woman from South America 
whom he had met on the Field 
Expedition; the features were 
not much alike, but their state 
of repair was identical. The face 
was a skull’s face under the 
makeup. She was fifty if she was 
a day — no, seventy-five — no, 
she was older than that. She was 
older than he liked to think, for 
a woman who dressed like a 
brash young girl. 

Cornut found himself ac- 
knowledging the introductions. 
Talking about him? What had 
they been saying? 

“We knew you’d be here, pal,” 
said the assassin, Jillson, kindly. 
“You think we murdered the 
kid.” 

“The kid?” 

“Master Carl,” said Jillson, not 
quite in a stammer. 

He had a reason, said a 
thought in Cornut’s mind. Queer- 
ly, it came in the half-stammer- 
ing accent of Jillson. 

“But sit down, Mas-ter Cor- 
nut.” St. Cyr gestured. 

Invitingly, the woman 



plumped cushions of aqua and 
turquoise on a divan. 

“I don’t want to sit down!” 

“No. But please do.” St. Cyr’s 
blue-tinged face was only polite. 

The fat man wheezed, “Too 
bad, youngster. We didn’t want to 
poke him along. I mean, why 
bother? But he was a nuisance. 
Every year,” he expanded cheer- 
ily, “we get maybe half a dozen 
who really make nuisances of 
themselves, mostly like you, 
some like him. His trouble was 
going after the classified material 
in the ‘Stacks. Well,” he said, 
severely waving a fat finger, 
“that material is classified for a 
reason.” 

Cornut sat down at last be- 
cause he couldn’t help himself. 
It was not going at all as he 
had expected; they were not de- 
nying a thing. But to admit that 
they killed Carl to protect some 
unimportant statistic in the cen- 
sus figures? 

It made no sense! 

The blonde laughed piercing- 
ly- 

“Forgive Miss Kerbs,” said the 
fat man. “She thinks you are 
funny for presuming to judge 
whether or not our actions are 
sensible. Believe me, young man, 
they are.” 

Cornut found that he was 
grinding his teeth. These one- 
sided conversations, the answers 
coming before the questions 



164 



GALAXY 



were spoken, these queer half- 
understood remarks . 

It was as though they knew 
every thought he had. 

It was as though they were — 
but no, it couldn’t be! Carl had 
proved it! 

The damn old fool. 

Cornut jumped. The thought 
was in the tones of the fat man’s 
wheeze, and he remembered 
where he had seen words like 
that before. 

The fat man nodded, his chins 
pulsing like a floating jellyfish. 
“We exposed his photographic 
plate for him,” he chuckled. “Oh, 
yes. It was only a joke, but we 
knew he would not live to make 
trouble over it. Once he had the 
Wolgren analysis, he would have 
to be helped along.” He said po- 
litely, “Too bad, because we 
wanted him to publish his proof 
that telepathy was impossible. 
Quite true, it is. For him. But not 
for us. And unfortunately not, 
my young friend, for you.” 

T OCILLE woke shivering, 
reaching out at once to Cor- 
nut’s side of the bed; but he was 
not in it. 

She turned on the room lights 
and scanned the nearest of the 
battery of clocks; one o’clock in 
the morning. 

Locille got up, looked out the 
window, listened at the hall door, 
turned on the broadcast radio, 



shook the speaker-mike of the 
University annunciator to make 
sure it was working, checked the 
telephone to see that it was not 
unhooked, sat down on the side 
of the bed and, finally, began 
silently to shake. She was fright- 
ened. 

Whatever compulsion drove 
Cornut to try suicide had never 
before stricken him when he was 
wide-awake and in possession of 
his thoughts. Was that no longer 
true? But if it was still true, why 
had he gone off like that? 

The radio was whispering per- 
suasively its stream of news bul- 
letins: Strikes in Gary, Indiana, 
a wreck of a cargo rocket, three 
hundred cases of Virus Gamma 
in one twelve-hour period, a ca- 
tastrophic accident between a 
nuclear trawler and a texas (she 
listened briefly, then relaxed) 
off the coast of Haiti. Because it 
did not mention Cornut’s name, 
she heard very little. Where 
could he be? 

When the telephone sounded, 
she answered it at once. 

It was not Cornut; it was the 
rough, quick voice of a busy 
man. “ — asked me to call. She 
is with your brother. Can you 
come?” 

“My mother asked you to 
call?” 

Impatiently: “That’s what I 
said. Your brother is seriously 
ill.” The voice did not hesitate. 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



165 



“It is likely that he will die 
within the next few hours. Good- 
by.” 

Locille dressed swiftly. She 
left urgent instructions with the 
night-proctor on what to do 
when — not if; when — Cornut 
returned. Watch him asleep; keep 
the door open; check him every 
half hour; be with him when he 
wakes. 

“Yes, ma’am,” said the student, 
and then, with gentleness, “He’ll 
be all right.” 

But would he? Locille hurried 
across the campus, closing her 
mind to that question. It was 
too late for a ferry from the 
island. She would have to go to 
the bridge, ride to the city, hope 
for a helipopper ferry to the 
texas from there. The Med Cen- 
ter was bright with lights from 
many rooms; curious, she 
thought, and hurried by. In their 
wired enclosure, the aboriginals 
were murmuring, not asleep. 
Curious again. 

But suppose the proctor for- 
got? 

Locille reassured herself that 
he would not forget; he was one 
of Cornut’s own students. In any 
case, she had to take the chance. 
She was almost grateful that 
something was making her leave, 
for the waiting had been un- 
bearable. 

She walked by the president’s 
residence with the barest glance; 



that it, too, was lighted was of 
no relevance to her own prob- 
lems, she thought. In this she 
was wrong. 

It was not until she was actu- 
ally boarding the monotrack 
that realization of where she was 
going and why finally struck 
her. Roger! He was dying. 

She began to weep, for Roger, 
for the missing Cornut, for her- 
self. 

A T that moment, Cornut, sore- 
•^"^■eyed, was picking himself up 
from the floor. Over him stood 
Jillson, holding a club wrapped 
with a wet cloth. Cornut was 
aching as he had never imagined 
he could. He mumbled: “You 
don’t have to hit me any more.” 

“Per-haps we do,” said St. Cyr 
from his blue-green throne. “We 
do not like this, you know, but 
we must.” 

“Speak for yourself,” said Jill- 
son, and the ancient blonde 
screeched with laughter. They 
were talking among themselves, 
Cornut realized; he could hear 
only the aural part, but they 
were joking, commenting . 
they were having a fine old time, 
while this methodical maniac 
bludgeoned him. 

The fat senator wheezed: 
“Understand our position, Cor- 
nut. We aren’t cruel. We don’t 
kill you shorties for nothing. But 
we aren’t human and we can’t be 



166 



GALAXY 



judged by human laws . All 
right, Jillson.” 

The bodyguard brought the 
club down and Cornut sank 
against the cushions the thought- 
ful old blonde kept repiling for 
him. What made it particularly 
bad was that the senator held 
a gun. 

The first time Cornut was 
beaten, he had fought, but then 
the senator had held him at gun- 
point while Jillson systematical- 
ly battered him. And all the time 
they kept talking! 

St. Cyr said mildly: “Stop.” 

It was time for another break. 
That had been the fifth beating 
in six or seven hours, and in be- 
tween they had interrogated 
him. 

“Tell us what you under- 
stand, Cor-nut.” 

The club had taught him obe- 
dience. “You are a worldwide 
organization,” he recited, “of the 
next species after humanity. I 
understand that. You need to 
survive and it doesn’t matter if 
the rest of us don’t. Through 
your telepathic abilities you can 
suggest suicide to some persons 
who have the power in a latent 
form — ” 

Thud. 

“An a-bort-ed form,” corrected 
St. Cyr as Cornut struggled erect 
again after the blow. 

He coughed and saw blood on 
the back of his hand. But he only 



said: “An aborted form. Like 
myself.” 

“Abortions of mutations,” 
chuckled the senator. “Unsuc- 
cessful attempts on the part of 
nature to create others like our- 
selves.” 

“Yes. Abortions of mutations, 
unsuccessful attempts. That is 
what I am,” Cornut parroted. 
“And — and you are able to 
suggest many things, as long as 
the subject has the — the abor- 
tive talent, and as long as you 
are able to reach his mind when 
it is not fully awake.” 

The blonde said, “Very good! 
You’re an apt learner, Cornut. 
But telepathy is only a fringe 
benefit. Do you know what it is 
that makes us really different?” 

He cringed away from Jillson 
as he shook his head. 

The bodyguard glanced at the 
woman, shrugged and said, “All 
right, I won’t if you say so. Go 
ahead.” 

“What it is that makes us dif- 
ferent is our age, my dear boy.” 
She giggled shrilly. “For ex- 
ample, I am two hundred and 
eighty-three years old.” 

'T'HEY fed him after a while 
and let him rest. 

Although he ached in every 
cell, there was hardly a mark 
on hinf; that was the reason for 
padding the club. And that had 
a meaning, too, Cornut thought 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



167 



painfully. If they didn’t want to 
mark him, then they realized 
that he would be seen. Which 
meant that, at least, they weren’t 
going to kill him out of hand 
and bury him somewhere. 

Two hundred and eighty-three 
years old. 

And yet she was the next to 
youngest of the four of them; 
Jillson was only a century or 
so old. The senator had been 
born while America was still a 
British colony. St. Cyr had been 
born in Louis Napoleon’s France. 

The whole key had been in 
the restricted areas of the Stacks, 
for the anomaly in the Wolgren 
application was not Wolgren’s 
fault at all. What the data would 
have shown was a failure of 
some people to die. Statistically 
insignificant for thousands of 
years, that fraction had grown 
and grown in the last two or 
three centuries — since Lister, 
since Pasteur, since Fleming. 
They were immortal not because 
they could not become diseased 
or succumb to a wound, but be- 
cause they would not otherwise 
die. 

VW^ITH the growth of preven- 
” tive medicine, they had be- 
gun to assert their power. They 
were not wiser than the rest of 
humanity or stronger. Even their 
telepathy was, it seemed unique 
only because the short-lived hu- 



man had not the time to develop 
it; it depended on intricate and 
slow-forming neuronic hookups. 
Everything that made them 
powerful was only the gift of 
time. 

They had money. But who, 
given a century or two of com- 
pound interest, could not be as 
rich as he choose? They had 
furthered many a war, for what 
greater boon than war is there 
to medical science? They had 
endowed countless foundations, 
for the surgery of the short-lived 
could help preserve their own 
infinitely more valuable lives. 
And they had only contempt for 
the short-lived who fed them, 
served them and made their 
lives possible. 

They had to be a closed cor- 
poration. Even an immortal 
needs friends, and the ordinary 
humans could for them be noth- 
ing more than weekend guests. 

Contempt . and fear. There 
were the Cornuts, they told him, 
who had a rudimentary telepath- 
ic sense, who could not be al- 
lowed to live to develop it. 
Suggest killing and the short- 
lived one died; it was that easy. 
The sleeping mind can build a 
dream out of a closing door, a 
distant truck’s exhaust. The half- 
awake mind can convert that 
dream into action . 

He heard a shrill laugh and 
the door opened. Jillson came in 



168

first. “No!” cried Cornut, bracing 
himself against the club. 

XIII 

T OCILLE sat next to her 
mother in the hospital’s cafe- 
teria, grateful that at last they 
had found a place to sit down. 
The hospital on the texas was 
unusually busy, worried visitors 
occupying every inch of space 
in the waiting room, the halls 
outside the reception area, even 
the glassed-in sundeck that hung 
over the angry waves and was 
normally used for the comfort 
of the patients during the day. It 
was very late and the cafeteria 
should have been closed, but the 
hospital had opened it for coffee 
and very little else. 

Her mother said something, 
but Locille only nodded. She 
hadn’t heard. It was not easy to 
hear, with the loud bull-roarer 
twangg of the suspended cables 
from the texas droning at them. 
And she had, besides, been think- 
ing mostly of Cornut. 

There had been no fresh news 
from the night-proctor on the 
phone; Cornut still had not 
returned. 

“He ate so well,” her mother 
said suddenly. 

Locille patted her hand. The 
coffee was cold, but she drank 
it anyhow. The doctor knew 
where to find her, she thought, 



though of course he would be 
busy . 

“He was the best of my ba- 
bies,” said her mother. 

Locille knew that it was very 
close to ending for her brother. 
The rash that baffled the med- 
ics, the fever that glazed his 
eyes — these were only the out- 
ward indicators of a terrible 
battle inside his motionless 
body; they represented the fact 
of blood and pain and death, 
but they were not the fact it- 
self. Roger was dying. The out- 
ward indicators had been con- 
trolled, but salve could only dry 
up the pustulant sores, pills 
could only calm his breathing, 
shots could only ease the pain 
in his head. 

“He ate so well,” her mother 
dreamed aloud, “and he talked 
at eighteen months. He had a 
little elephant with a music box 
and he could wind it up.” 

“Don’t worry,” said Locille 
worriedly. 

“But we let him go swim- 
ming,” sighed her mother, look- 
ing around the crowded room. It 
was she, not Locille, who first 
saw the nurse coming toward 
them through the crowd, and she 
must have known as soon as Lo- 
cille, from the look on the 
nurse’s face, what the message 
would be. 

“He was the tenth today,” 
whispered the nurse, after look- 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



169 



ing for a private place to tell 
them and not finding it. “He 
never regained consciousness.” 

/^ORNUT walked out of the 
^ residence, blinking. It was 
morning. “Nice day,” he said po- 
litely to Jillson, beside him. Jill- 
son nodded. He was pleased 
with Cornut. The kid wasn’t go- 
ing to give them any trouble. 

As they walked, Jillson “shout- 
ed” in Cornut’s mind. It was hard 
with these half-baked telepaths, 
but it was part of his job. He 
was the executioner. You need 
to die. You’ll kill yourself. 

“Oh, yes,” said Cornut, aloud. 
He was surprised. He’d prom- 
ised, hadn’t he? He bore no re- 
sentment for the beating. He 
understood that it had a pur- 
pose; the more dazed, the more 
exhausted he was, the surer their 
control of him. He had no ob- 
jection at all to being under the 
control of four ancient immor- 
tals. 

You die, Cornut, but what 
difference does it make? Today, 
tomorrow, fifty years from now. 
It’s all the same. 

“That’s right,” Cornut agreed 
politely. He was not very in- 
terested. The subject had been 
thoroughly covered, all night 
long. 

He noticed absently that 
there was a considerable crowd 
around the Med Center. The 



whole campus seemed somehow 
uneasy. 

They crossed under the 
shadow of the Administration 
Building and circled around it, 
toward Math Tower. 

You will die, you know, 
shouted Jillson. One day the 
world will wake up and no Cor- 
nut. Put a stethoscope to his 
poor chest, no heartbeats. The 
sound of a beating heart that 
you have heard every day of your 
life will never be heard again. 

Cornut was embarrassed. 
These things were true; he did 
not mind being told them, but 
it was certainly rather immature 
of Jillson to take such evident 
pleasure in them. 

The brain turns into jelly, 
chanted Jillson gleefully. The 
body turns into slime. He licked 
his lips, hot-eyed. 

Cornut looked about him, 
anxious to change the subject. 
“Isn’t that Sergeant Rhame?” 

Jillson pounded on: The 

hangnail on your thumb that 
hurts now will dissolve and rot 
and molder. Not even the pain 
will ever be thought of by any 
living human again. Your bed- 
girl, is there anything you ever 
put off telling her? You never 
will now. 

“It is Sergeant Rhame. 
Sergeant!” 

Damn! crashed a thought in 
Cornut’s mind; but Jillson was 



170 



GALAXY 



smiling, smiling. “Hello, Ser- 
geant,” he said with his voice, 
his mind raging. 

TF Cornut had known how, he 
would have helped Jillson 
along, but his half-dazed condi- 
tion robbed him of enterprise. 
Too bad, he thought consolingly, 
hoping that Jillson would pick 
up the thought. I know St. Cyr 
ordered you to stay with me un- 
til I was dead, but don’t worry. 
I’ll kill myself. 

I promise. 

Sergeant Rhame was talking 
gruffly to Jillson about the mob 
at Med Center. Cornut wished 
Rhame would go away. He un- 
derstood that Rhame was a dan- 
ger to the immortals; they could 
not be involved with the same 
people in violent deaths. Rhame 
had investigated the death of 
Master Carl at Jillson’s hands; 
he could not now be allowed to 
investigate even the suicide of 
Master Cornut, when he had 
seen Jillson with him going to 
his death. Jillson would have to 
leave him now. Too bad. It was 
so right, Cornut thought, that he 
should die for the sake of pre- 
serving the safety of the im- 
mortals. He knew this; they had 
told him so themselves. 

Something caught his atten- 
tion: “ — since the sickness began 
they’ve been mobbing every hos- 
pital,” Sergeant Rhame was say- 



ing to Jillson, waving at the mob 
before Med Center. 

“Sickness?” asked Cornut. He 
stared at the policeman. It was 
as though Rhame had said, “I’ve 
got to get some garlic. There are 
vampires loose tonight.” Sick- 
ness was a relic of the dark ages. 
You could have a headache or 
a queasy stomach, yes, but you 
went to the clinic and the diag- 
nosticon did the rest. 

Rhame grumbled, “Where’ve 
you been, Master Cornut? 
Nearly a thousand deaths in this 
area alone. Mobs seeking immu- 
nization. It’s smallpox, they 
think.” 

“Smallpox?” Even more fan- 
tastic! Cornut knew the word 
only as an archeological medical 
relic. 

“Accidents all over the city,” 
said Rhame, and Cornut thought 
suddenly of the crash he had 
seen. “Fever and rash and — 
hell, I don’t know what all the 
symptoms are. But it’s fatal. The 
— the medics don’t seem to 
have a cure.” 

“Me disfella smellim,” said a 
voice from behind Rhame. “Him 
spoilim fes distime. Plantim 
manyfella pox.” It was one of 
the aboriginals, quietly observ- 
ing while Rhame’s police squad 
erected barricades in front of 
their enclosure. “Plantim mefella 
Mary,” he added sadly. 

Rhame said, “Understand any 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



171 



of it? It’s English, if you listen 
close. Pidgin. He’s been saying 
they know about smallpox. He 
said his wife died of it.” 

“Plantim mefella Mary,” 
agreed the aboriginal in a melan- 
choly voice. 

Rhame said, “Unfortunately, I 
think he’s right. Looks like your 
Field Expedition brought a lot 
of trouble back with it; the focus 
of infection seems to vector from 
these people. Look at their 
faces.” 

Cornut looked. The broad, 
dark cheeks were waffled with 
old pitted scars. 

“So we’re trying to keep the 
mob from making trouble here,” 
said Sergeant Rhame, “by put- 
ting a fence around them.” 

Cornut was even more incred- 
ulous than before. Mob vio- 
lence? 

It was not really his problem 
. since he would have no more 
problems in the world. He 
nodded politely to Rhame, con- 
spiratorially to Jillson, and 
moved on toward Math Tower. 
The aboriginal yelled something 
after him — “Waitimup mefella 
Masatura-san! He speak you!” 
— it sounded like. Cornut paid 
no attention. 

Jillson “yelled” after him too. 
Don’t forget! You must die! Cor- 
nut turned and nodded. Of 
course he had to die. It was only 
right. 



l^ORTUNATELY Locille was 
not in the room. Cornut felt, 
and quelled, a swift reeling sense 
of horror at the thought of losing 
her. It was only an emotion, 
though, and he was its master. 

Probably Pithecanthropus had 
had similar emotions, he thought, 
casting about for a convenient 
way to die. 

He made sure his door was 
locked and decided to treat him- 
self to a farewell drink. He 
found a bottle, poured, toasted 
the air and said aloud: “To the 
next species.” Then he buckled 
down to work. 

The idea of dying is never far 
from the mind of any mortal, 
but Cornut had not viewed it as 
anything up close in the fore- 
ground of his future. It was curi- 
ously alarming. Everybody did 
it, he assured himself. (Well, al- 
most everybody.) Why did it 
seem so hard? 

As Cornut was a methodical 
man, he sat down at his desk and 
began to make a list, headed: 

MEANS OF DEATH 

1. Poison. 

2. Slash wrists. 

3. Jump from window. (Or bridge.) 

4. Electrocution. 

He paused. Electrocution? It 
didn’t sound so bad, especially 
considering that he had already 
tried most of the others, helped 



172 



GALAXY 



along by the insistent siren voice 
of the immortals in his brain. It 
would be nice to try something 
new. 

He poured himself another 
drink to think about it and be- 
gan to hum. He was feeling quite 
peaceful. 

“It’s only right that I should 
die,” he said. “Naturally. Are you 
listening, Jillson?” He couldn’t 
tell, of course, but probably they 
were. 

And maybe they were wor- 
ried. That was a saddening 
thought; he didn’t want the im- 
mortals to worry about him. 

“I understand perfectly,” he 
said out loud. “I hope you hear 
me. I’m in your way.” He paused, 
not aware that he had raised a 
lectorial finger. “It is like this. 
Suppose I had terminal cancer. 
Suppose St. Cyr and I were in 
a shipwreck and there was only 
one lifebelt. He has a life ahead 
of him; I have at best a week of 
pain. Who gets the lifebelt?” He 
shook the finger. “St. Cyr does!” 
he thundered. “And this is the 
same case. I have a mortal dis- 
ease, humanity. And it’s their 
lives or mine!” 

He poured another drink and 
decided that the truths that had 
been whipped into him were too 
great to lose. The sheet of paper 
with suicide possibilities fell un- 
heeded to the floor. Humming, 
he wrote: 



We are children and the im- 
mortals are fully grown. Like 
children, we need their knowl- 
edge. They lead us; they direct 
our universities and plan our 
affairs; they have the wisdom 
of centuries and without them 
we would be lost, random par- 
ticles, statistical chaos. But we 
are dangerous children, so they 
must remain secret and those 
who guess must die . 

TTE crumpled the piece of 
paper angrily. He had 
nearly spoiled everything! He 
saw all the more clearly why he 
had to die to protect their secret. 
He scrambled on the floor for 
the list of suicide possibilities, 
but stopped, bent over, staring at 
the floor. 

The truth was that he didn’t 
like any of them. 

He sat up and poured a drink. 
He couldn’t rely on himself to 
do a good job, he grumbled to 
himself. Slashing his wrists, for 
example. Someone might come; 
and what could be more annoy- 
ing than waking up on an oper- 
ating table with sutures in his 
veins and the whole damned 
thing to do over again? 

He noticed that his glass was 
again empty, but didn’t bother 
to refill it. He was feeling quite 
sufficiently alcoholic already. If 
it weren’t for his own con- 
founded human ineptitude, he 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



173 



could be feeling pretty good, in 
fact, for it was nice to know that 
in a very short time he would be 
serving the best interests of the 
world by dying. Very nice. 

He . got up and wandered to 
the window, beaming. Outside, 
the mobs were still swarming, 
trying to get immunization at 
the Med Center. Poor fools. He 
was so much better off than 
they! 

“Strike the twos and strike 
the threes,” he sang. “The Sieve 
of — say!” 

He had an idea. How fine it 
was, he thought gratefully, to 
have the wise helping hand of 
an elder friend in a time like 
this. He didn’t have to worry 
about how to die or whether he’d 
make a mess of it. He needed 
only to give St. Cyr and the 
others a chance. Just relax . 
let himself get drowsy . even 
more drunk, perhaps. They 
would do the rest. 

“The Sieve of Eratosthenes,” 
he sang cheerfully. “When the 
multiples sublime, the numbers 
that are left are prime!” He 
stumbled over to his bed and 
sprawled on it. 

After a moment he got up, 
angrily. He wasn’t being a bit 
fair. If it was difficult for him to 
find a convenient way of dying 
in his room, why should he im- 
pose that problem on his good 
liege, St. Cyr? 



He was extremely irritated 
with himself over that; but, pick- 
ing up the bottle, marching out 
into the hall, singing as he 
looked for a conveniently fatal 
spot, he gradually began to feel 
very good again. 

OERGEANT Rhame tested 
^ the barricades in front of the 
aboriginal enclosure and sent his 
men back to trying to control 
the mobs at Med Center. All the 
time his squad was working, the 
aboriginals had been trying to 
talk to them in their odd pidgin, 
but the police were too busy. 
The one who spoke English at 
all well, Masatura-san, was in his 
hut; the others were almost in- 
comprehensible. 

Rhame glanced at his watch 
and decided that he had time for 
a quick cup of coffee before go- 
ing over to help his men with the 
crowd. Although, he thought, it 
might be kinder to leave the 
crowd alone to crush half its 
members to death. At least it 
would be quick: And the private 
information of the police depart- 
ment surgeon was that the in- 
oculations were not very effec- 
tive. 

He turned, startled, as a girl’s 
voice called him. 

It was Locille, weeping. 
“Please, can you help me? Cor- 
nut’s gone, and my brother’s 
dead, and — I found this.” She 



174 



GALAXY 



held out the sheet with Cornut’s 
carefully lettered list of suicide 
possibilities. 

The fact that Rhame had 
been taken from his computer 
studies to help hold a mob down 
was evidence enough that he 
really belonged there; but he 
hesitated and was lost. Individ- 
ual misery was that much more 
persuasive than mass panic. 

He began with the essentials: 
“Where is he? No idea at all? 
No note? Any witnesses who 
might have seen him go? You 
didn’t ask? Why — ” But he had 
no time to ask why she had 
failed to question witnesses; he 
knew that every moment Cor- 
nut was off by himself was very 
possibly the moment in which 
he would die. 

They found the student proc- 
tor, jumpy and distracted but 
still somewhere near his post. 
And he had seen Cornut! 

“He was kind of crazy, I 
thought. I tried to tell him some- 
thing — you know Egerd, used to 
be in his class?” (He knew per- 
fectly just how well Locille had 
known Egerd.) “He died this 
morning. I thought Master Cornut 
would be interested, but he didn’t 
even hear when I told him.” 

Rhame observed the expres- 
sion on Locille’s face, but there 
was no time to worry about her 
feeling for a dead under-gradu- 
ate. “Which way? When?” 



Cornut had gone down the 
corridor more than half an hour 
before. They followed. 

Locille said miserably: “It’s a 
miracle he’s alive at all! But if 
he lasted this long . and I was 
just a few minutes late . .” 

“Shut up,” the policeman said 
harshly, and called out to an- 
other undergraduate. 

Trailing Cornut was easy; he 
had been conspicuous by his 
wild behavior even on that pan- 
icky day. A few yards from the 
faculty refectory, they heard 
raucous singing. 

“It’s Cornut!” cried Locille, 
and raced ahead. Rhame caught 
her at the door of the kitchens 
where she had worked so many 
months. 

Cornut was staggering about, 
singing in a slurred howl one of 
Master Carl’s favorite tunes: 

Add ray to modul, close th ’ set 

To adding, subtracting — 

He stumbled against a cutting 
table and swore good-naturedly. 

Produce a new system, an’ 
this goddam thing 

Is gen’ rally termed a (hie) 
ring! 

In one hand he had a sharp 
knife, filched from the meat- 
cutter’s drawer; he waved it, 
marking time. 

“Come on, damn it!” he cried, 
laughing. “Poke me along!” 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



175 



“Save him!” cried Locille, and 
started to run to him, but Rhame 
grabbed her arm. “Let go of me! 
He might kill himself with that 
knife!” 

Cornut didn’t even hear them; 
he was singing again. Rhame 
said at last: “But he isn’t doing 
it, you see, and he’s had plenty 
of time, by the look of the place. 
Maybe I’m wrong, Locille, but 
it looks to me as if he’s not 
suicidal — just blind drunk.” 



XIV 

HROUGHOUT the city and 
elsewhere there were scenes 
like the one in front of Med 
Center, as a populace panicked 
by the apparition of pestilence — 
vanished these centuries! — 
scrambled for the amulet that 
would guard them against it. 
Hardly one in a couple of hun- 
dred was seriously ill, but that 
was enough. Half of one per 
cent of billions is millions — mil- 
lions of cases of the most deadly, 
most contagious and least ex- 
cusable disease in medicine. For 
smallpox can infallibly be pre- 
vented, and only a world which 
had forgotten Jenner could have 
been taken by it unaware ... or 
a world in which the memory of 
Jenner’s centuries-old cure had 
been systematically removed. 

In the highest tower of Port 



Monmouth, the eight major tele- 
vision networks shared joint 
transmitter - repeater facilities. 
Equatorially mounted wire sau- 
cers scanned the sky for the re- 
peater satellites. As each satel- 
lite in its orbit broke free of the 
horizon, a saucer hunted and 
found it. That saucer clung to it 
as it traversed the sky, breaking 
free and commencing the search 
pattern for a new one as the old 
one dipped beneath the curve of 
the Earth again. There were 
more than sixty satellites circling 
the Earth which the repeaters 
could use, each one specially 
launched and instrumented to 
receive, amplify and rebroadcast 
the networks’ programs. 

Sam Gensel was senior shift 
engineer for the all-network 
technical crew at Port Mon- 
mouth. 

It was not up to him to go 
out and get the pictures, to stage 
the shows or to decide what went 
out on the air. Lecturing math 
professors, dimple-kneed dancers, 
sobbing soap-opera heroines — 
he saw all of them on the 
banked row of monitors in his 
booth, yet he saw none of them. 
They were only pictures. What 
he really liked was test patterns; 
they showed more of what he 
wanted to see. He watched for 
ripples of poor phasing, drifts off 
center, the electronic snowstorm 
of line failure. If the picture was 



176 



GALAXY 



clear, he hardly noticed what it 
represented . except tonight. 

Tonight he was white-faced. 

“Chief,” moaned the rabbity 
junior engineer from Net Five, 
“it’s all over the country! Sacra- 
mento just came in. And the re- 
lay from Rio has a local collect 
that shows trouble all over South 
America.” 

“Watch your monitor,” Gen- 
sel ordered, turning away. It was 
very important that he keep a 
clear head, he told himself. Un- 
fortunately the head that he had 
to keep clear was aching fiercely. 

“I’m going to get an aspirin,” 
he growled to his line man, a 
thirty-year veteran whose hands, 
tonight, were trembling. Gensel 
filled a paper cup of water and 
swallowed two aspirins, sighed 
and sat down at the coffee- 
ringed desk in the office he sel- 
dom had time to use. 

One of the monitors showed 
an announcer whose smile was 
desperate as he read'a newscast: 

“ — disease fails to respond to 
any of the known antibiotics. All 
persons are cautioned to stay in- 
doors as much as possible. Large 
gatherings are forbidden. All 
schools are closed until further 
notice. It is strongly urged that 
even within families personal 
contact be avoided as much as 
possible. And, above all, the De- 
partment of Public Health urges 
that everyone wait until an or- 



derly program of immunization 
can be completed.” 

/^ENSEL turned his back on 
the monitor and picked up 
the phone. He dialed the front 
office. “Mr. Tremonte, please. 
Gensel here. Operational emer- 
gency priority.” 

The girl was businesslike and 
efficient (but did her voice have 
a faint hysterical tremor?). “Yes, 
sir. Mr. Tremonte is at his home. 
I will relay.” 

Click, click. The picture whir- 
red, blurred, went to black. Then 
it came on again. Old man Tre- 
monte was slouched at ease in a 
great leather chair, staring out at 
him irritably; the flickering light 
on his face showed that he was 
sitting by his fireplace. “Well?” 

That queer, thin voice. Gensel 
had always, as a matter of em- 
ployee discipline, stepped down 
hard on the little jokes about the 
Old Man — he had transistors in- 
stead of tonsils; his wife didn’t 
put him to bed at night, she 
turned him off. But there was 
something creepy about the slow, 
mechanical way he talked, and 
that old, lined face! 

Gensel said rapidly: “Sir, 

every net is carrying interrupt 
news bulletins. The situation is 
getting bad. Net Five canceled 
the sports roundup, Seven ran an 
old tape of Bubbles Brinkhouse 
— the word is he’s dying. I want 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



1 77 



permission to go over to emer- 
gency procedure. Cancel all 
shows, pool the nets for news 
and civil-defense instructions.” 

Old man Tremonte rubbed his 
thin, long nose and abruptly 
laughed, like a store-window 
Santa. “Gensel, boy,” he rasped, 
“don’t get upset over a few sniff- 
ly noses. You’re dealing with an 
essential public service.” 

“Sir, there are people sick, 
dying!” 

Tremonte said slowly: “That 
leaves a lot who aren’t. We’ll 
continue with our regular pro- 
grams — and, Gensel, I’m going 
away for a few days; I expect 
you to be in charge. I do not 
give you permission to go over 
to emergency procedure,” and 
he cut the contact. 

I never got a chance to tell 
him about the remote from Phil- 
adelphia, thought Gensel despair- 
ingly, thinking of the trampled 
hundreds at the Municipal 
Clinic. 

He felt his warm forehead and 
decided cloudily that what he 
really needed was a couple more 
aspirin . although the last two, 
for some reason, hadn’t agreed 
with him. Not at all. In fact, he 
felt rather queasy. 

Definitely queasy. 

At the console, the line man 
saw his chief gallop clumsily to- 
ward the men’s washroom, one 
hand pressed to his mouth. 



The line man grinned. Fifteen 
minutes later, though, he was not 
grinning at all. That was when 
the Net Three audio man came 
running in to report that the 
chief was out cold, breathing like 
a broken-down steam boiler, on 
the washroom floor. 

/^ORNUT, with black coffee in 
him, was beginning to come 
back to something resembling 
normal functioning. 

He heard Rhame talking to 
Locille: “What he really needs is 
massive vitamin injections. That 
would snap him right around — 
but you’ve seen what the Med 
Center looks like. We’ll have to 
wait until he sobers up.” 

“I am sober,” said Cornut feeb- 
ly, but he knew it was untrue. 
“What happened?” 

He listened while they told 
him what had been going on in 
the past twenty-four hours. Lo- 
cille’s brother dead, Egerd dead, 
plague loose in the land . the 
world had become a different 
place. 

He heard and was affected, 
but there was enough liquor in 
him and enough of the high-pres- 
sure compulsion exercised by the 
immortals so that he was able 
to view this new world objec- 
tively. Too bad. But he felt 
shame — why had he failed to 
kill himself? 

Locille’s hand was in his, and 



178 



GALAXY 



Cornut, looking at her, never 
wanted to let it go again. He had 
not died when he should have, 
and now he wanted to live. It 
was shameful, but he could not 
deny it. 

The liquor in him gave the 
world a warm, fresh appearance. 
He still was ashamed, but the 
feeling was remote; it was a fail- 
ure of his childhood, bad, but so 
long ago. Meanwhile he was 
warm and comfortable. 

“Please drink some more cof- 
fee,” said Locille, and he was 
happy to oblige her. 

All the stimuli of twenty-four 
full hours were working on him 
at once, the beating, the strain, 
the compulsion of the immortals, 
the liquor. 

He caught a glimpse of Lo- 
cille’s expression and realized he 
had been humming. 

“Sorry,” he said, and held out 
his cup for more coffee. 

A ROUND the texas, the waves 
were growing higher. The 
black barges tossed like chips. 
Locille’s parents braved the 
wind-blown rain topside to wit- 
ness the solemn lowering of their 
son’s casket into the black- 
decked funeral barge. They were 
not alone — there were other 
mourners with them, strangers — 
and it was not quiet. Dwang-g-g 
went the bullroarer vibration of 
the steel cables. Hutch -chumpf, 



hutch -chumpi, the pneumatic 
pens in the tower’s legs caught 
trapped air from the waves and 
valved it into the pressure tanks 
for the generators. The noise 
nearly drowned out the sound of 
the music. 

It was the custom to play 
solemn music at funerals, from 
tapes kept in the library for the 
purpose. The bereft were privi- 
leged to choose the program — 
hymns for the religious, chorales 
for the classicists, largos for the 
merely mourning. Today no 
choice was offered. The audio 
speakers played without end, a 
continuous random selection of 
dirges. There were too many 
mourners watching their chil- 
dren, parents or wives being 
winched onto the tossing barges, 
on their way to the deep-sea 
funerary drop. 

Six, seven . Locille’s father 
carefully counted eight barges 
lying along the texas, waiting to 
be loaded. Each one held a dozen 
bodies. It was a bad sickness, 
he thought with detachment, re- 
alizing that the bodies outnum- 
bered the mourners because, of- 
ten enough, whole families were 
being put aboard the barge to- 
gether. 

He rubbed the back of his 
neck, which had begun to hurt. 
The mother standing beside him 
neither thought nor counted, 
only wept.

VK/'HEN Cornut sobered, he be- 
gan to view his world and 
his past day in harsher, clearer 
perspective. Rhame helped. The 
policeman had the scraps of 
paper Cornut had left and he 
was remorseless in questioning. 
“ Why must you die? Who are 
the immortals? How did they 
make you try to kill yourself — 
and why didn’t you this last 
time, with every chance in the 
world?” 

Cornut tried to explain. To 
die, he said, remembering the 
lesson that had come with the 
beating, that is nothing; all of us 
do it. Suicide is a victory in a 
way, because it makes death 
come to us on our terms. St. Cyr 
and the others, however — 

“St. Cyr’s gone,” snapped the 
policeman. “Did you know that? 
He’s gone and so is his body- 
guard. Master Finloe from Bio- 
chemistry is gone, and his secre- 
tary says he left with Jillson and 
that old blonde. Where?” 

Cornut frowned. It was not in 
keeping with his concept of im- 
mortality that they should flee 
in the face of a plague. Super- 
men should be heroic, should 
they not? He tried to explain 
that, but Rhame pounced on 
him: “Super-murderers, you 

mean! Where did they go?” 

Cornut said apologetically: “I 
don’t know. But I assure you 
that they had reasons.” 



Rhame nodded. His voice was 
suddenly softer. “Yes, they did. 
Would you like to know what 
those reasons were? The savages 
brought that disease. They came 
off their island carrying active 
smallpox, nearly every one of 
them. The most active cases 
were brought; the well ones were 
left on the island. They were 
given injections — to cure them, 
they thought, but the surgeon 
says they were only cosmetic 
cures; the disease was still con- 
tagious. And they were flown to 
every major city in the world, 
meeting thousands of people. 
They were coached,” said 
Rhame, his face working, “in the 
proper behavior in civilized so- 
ciety. For example, the pipe of 
peace isn’t their custom; they 
were told it would please us. 
Does that add up to anything 
for you?” 

Cornut leaned forward, his 
horrified eyes on Rhame. Add 
up? It added up; the sum was 
inescapable. The disease was de- 
liberately spread. The immortals 
had, in their self-oriented wis- 
dom, determined to move 
against the short-lived human 
race, in a way that had nearly 
destroyed it more than once in 
ancient days: They had spread 
a fearsome plague. 

Locille screamed. 

Cornut realized tardily that 
she had been drowsing against 



180 



GALAXY 



his shoulder, unable to sleep, un- 
able after the sleepless night to 
stay fully awake. Now she was 
sitting bolt upright, staring at 
the tiny glittering manicure scis- 
sors in her hand. 

“Cornut!” she cried. “I was go- 
ing to stab you in — in the 
throat!” 

TT was night, and outside the 
-*■ high arch of the bridge was a 
line of color, the lights of the 
speedy monotracks and private 
vehicles making a moving row 
or dots. 

On one of the monotracks, the 
motorman was half listening to 
a news broadcast: 

“The situation in the midwest 
is not as yet critical, but a wave 
of fear has spread through all 
the major cities of Iowa, Kansas 
and Nebraska. In Omaha more 
than sixty persons were killed 
when three heli-buses bearing 
emigrants collided in a bizarre 
midair accident, apparently 
caused by pilot error in one of 
the chartered planes. Here in 
Des Moines all transportation 
came to a halt for nearly ninety 
minutes this morning as air-con- 
trol personnel joined the fleeing 
throngs, leaving their posts un- 
attended. In a statement re- 
leased — ” 

The motorman blinked and 
concentrated on his controls. He 
was fifty years old, had held this 



job and almost this run more than 
half his life. He rubbed the sen- 
sor collar irritably; he had worn 
it nearly thirty years, but tonight 
it bothered him. 

The collar was like a dead- 
man’s switch, designed to monitor 
temperature and pulse, electroni- 
cally linked to cut the mono- 
track’s power and apply the 
brakes in the event of death or 
serious illness to the motorman. 
He was quite used to wearing 
these collars and appreciated 
their need; but tonight, climbing 
the approach ramp to the bridge 
in third speed, his throat began 
to feel constricted. 

Also his head ached. Also his 
eyes itched and burned. He 
reached for the radio mike that 
connected him to the dispatcher’s 
office, and croaked, “Charley, I 
think I’m going to black out. 
I — ” He fell forward. The sensors 
around his neck had marked his 
abnormal pulse and respiration 
and reacted as he collapsed. The 
monotrack stopped dead. 

But another one drove catas- 
trophically into its tail. 

The motorman of the second 
unit had been feeling queasy for 
more than an hour and was anx- 
ious to get to the end of his 
run; he had been overriding the 
automatic slowdown controls all 
the way across the bridge. As he 
passed the critical parameters of 
sensor monitoring, his own collar 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



181 



switched off the power in his 
drive wheels, but by then it was 
too late; the wheels raced crazily 
against air. Even the sensor col- 
lars had not been designed to 
cope with two motorman failures 
in the same second. White sparks 
flew from bridge to water and 
died — great white sparks that 
were destroyed metal. The sound 
of crashing battered at the 
campus of the University below. 
The bridge stopped, its moving 
lights becoming a row of colored 
dots with one great hideous flare 
of color in the middle. 

Distant ambulance sirens be- 
gan to wail. 

/^ORNUT held his weeping 
^ wife, his face incredulous, 
his mind working. Locille trying 
to kill him? Impossible! 

But like the other impossible 
factors in his own life, it was 
not inexplicable. He became con- 
scious of faint whispering 
thoughts in his own mind. He 
said to Rhame: “They couldn’t 
reach me! They tried to work 
through her!” 

“Why couldn’t they reach 
you?” 

Cornut shrugged and patted 
Locille’s shoulder. She sat up, 
saw the scissors and hurled them 
away. “Don’t worry, I under 
stand,” he said to her, and to the 
policeman: “I don’t know why. 
Sometimes they can’t Like in 



the refectory kitchen; they 
could have killed me. I even 
wanted them to, but they didn’t. 
And once on the island, when I 
was all beered up. And once — 
remember, Locille? — on the 
bridge. Each time I was wide 
open to them, and on the bridge 
they almost made it. But each 
time I was fuddled. I’d been 
drinking,” he said, “or taking 
sleepy pills, and they should 
have been able to walk right in 
and take possession . .” His 
voice trailed thoughtfully off. 

Rhame said sharply: “What’s 
the matter with Locille?” 

The girl blinked and sat up 
again. “I guess I’m sleepy,” she 
apologized. “Funny . .” 

Cornut was looking at her 
with great interest, not as a wife 
but as a specimen. “What’s 
funny?” 

“I keep hearing someone talk- 
ing to me,” she said, rubbing her 
face fretfully. She was exhausted, 
Cornut saw; she could not stay 
awake much longer — not even if 
she thought herself a murderer, 
not even if he died before her 
eyes, not even if the world came 
to an end. 

“Talking to you? Saying 
what?” 

“I don’t know. Funny. ‘Me 
softspeak you-fella.’ Like that.” 

Rhame said immediately: 
“Pidgin. You’ve been with the 
aboriginals.” He dismissed the 



182 



GALAXY 



XV 



matter and returned to Cornut: 
“You were on the point of some- 
thing. You said sometimes they 
could get at you, sometimes not. 
Why? What was the reason?” 

“Drinking or taking sleepy 
pills.” 

It was true! Three times he 
had been where death should 
have found him, and each time 
it had missed. 

And each time he had been 
fuddled! The alcohol or sedation 
in his brain, the selective chemi- 
cals that struck first at the upper- 
most level of the brain, reducing 
visual discrimination, slowing re- 
sponses ... it had deafened him 
to the mind voices that willed 
him to death! 

“Smellim olefella bagarimop 
allfella,” Locille said clearly, and 
smiled. “Sorry. That’s what I 
wanted to say.” 

Cornut sat frozen for an end- 
less second. 

Then he moved. The bottle he 
had carried with him, Rhame 
had thriftily brought back to the 
room. Cornut grabbed it, up-end- 
ed it, took a deep swallow and 
passed it to Locille. “Drink! Don’t 
argue — take a good stiff drink!” 
He coughed and wiped tears 
from his eyes. The liquor tasted 
foul; it would take little to make 
him drunk again. 

But that little might save his 
life . Locille’s life ... it might 
save the world’s! 



r T , AI-I Masatura-san got up 
from his bed and walked to 
the strong new fence. The crazy 
white people had not come up 
with dinner for them. It was 
getting very late, he judged. A 
few weeks ago, on his island, the 
Southern Cross, wheeling about 
the sky, was all the clock a man 
needed. These strange northern 
constellations were cold and un- 
pleasant. They told him nothing 
he wanted to know, neither time 
nor direction. 

His broad nostrils wrinkled 
angrily. 

In order to become a tai-i, a 
captain, he had had to become 
skilled in the art of reading the 
stars, among many other arts. 
Now that art was of no value, 
rendered useless by the stronger 
art of the white man. His gift of 
deepsmell — the reaching out 
with a part of his mind to de- 
tect truth or falsehood that made 
him a tribal magistrate — had 
been voided by the old ones, who 
smelled so strongly and yet 
could baffle his inner nose. 

He should never have trusted 
the softspeaking white man of 
great age, he thought, and spat 
on the ground. 

His second in command 
moaned at the door of the hut. 

In the creolized speech which 
served them better than the 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



183 



tribe’s pidgin or Masatura-san’s 
painful English, the man whim- 
pered : “I have asked them to 
come, but they do not seem to 
hear.” 

“One hears,” said Masatura- 
san. 

“The old ones are softspeak- 
ing endlessly,” whined the sick 
man. 

“I hear,” said Masatura-san, 
closing his mind. He squatted, 
looking at the stars and the fence. 
Outside, the campus was still 
noisy, voices, vehicles, even so 
late at night. 

He thought very carefully 
what he wanted to do. 

Masatura-san was a tai-i be- 
cause of strength and learning, 
but also because of heredity. 
When the Japanese off the tor- 
pedoed destroyer had managed 
to reach that Pacific island in 
1944, they had found a flourish- 
ing community. The Japanese 
strain in Masatura-san’s ances- 
try came only from that gen- 
eration. Before that, his forebears 
were already partly exotic, for 
the twelve Japanese were not 
the first sailors to wash ashore. 
Once “Masatura-san” had been 
“Masterson.” English fathers and 
Melanesian mothers had pro- 
duced a sturdy race — after the 
objecting male Melanesians had 
been killed off. The Japanese re- 
peated the process with the hy- 
brids they found, as the English 



had done before them, except for 
a few. 

One of those few was the great- 
grandfather of Tai-i Masatura- 
san. He had been spared for 
exactly one reason: He was the 
chief priest of the community, 
and had been for nearly a cen- 
tury; the islanders all would have 
died to save him. 

Three hundred years later, his 
second-generation offspring had 
inherited some of his talents. One 
was “deepsmelling” — no sniff 
of the nostrils, but a different 
sense entirely. Another was age. 
Masatura-san himself was nearly 
a century old. It was the only 
thing he had managed to con- 
ceal from the owners of the 
strange softspeak voices who had 
found him on his island, and 
promised him much if he would 
help them. 

The “deepsmell” of the world 
beyond the barricade was very 
bad. 

Tai-i Masatura-san thought 
carefully and made a decision. 
He moved over to the hut and 
poked his second in command 
with his foot. “Speak along him- 
fella two-time again,” he ordered 
in pidgin. “Me help.” 

/^ORNUT left his wife smiling 
^ laxly and sound asleep. “I’ll 
be back,” he whispered, and with 
Sergeant Rhame hurried out on- 
to the campus. 



184 



GALAXY 



The wind was rising and stars 
broke through scudding clouds. 
The campus was busy. Around 
the Med Center, hundreds of 
people still waited, not because 
they had hope of immunization 
— the fact that the vaccine was 
ineffective had been announced 
— but because they had nowhere 
else to go. Inside the clinic, med- 
ics with white faces and red eyes 
labored endlessly, repeating the 
same tasks because they knew 
no others. In the first hour they 
had discovered that the refer- 
ence Stacks had been looted of 
three centuries of epidemiology; 
they could not hope to replace 
them in time, but they could not 
help but try. Half the medics 
were themselves sick, ambula- 
tory but doomed. 

Cornut was worried, not for 
himself but for Locille. Thinking 
back to the Field Expedition, he 
remembered the shots that they 
had all taken and felt it more 
than likely that everyone receiv- 
ing them had been rendered im- 
mune to the smallpox. But what 
of Locille? She had had nothing. 

He had already told Rhame 
about the shots, and Rhame had 
instantly reported to the police 
headquarters; they would radio 
the island, try to locate the med- 
ics who had administered the 
vaccine. Neither of them was 
hopeful. The immortals would 
surely have removed all traces 



of what might halt their attack 
against the short-lived bulk of 
humanity. 

But that thought had a corol- 
lary, too: If the immortals had 
removed it, the immortals had it 
now. 

The aboriginals were waiting. 
“You called us?” said Cornut — 
it was a question; he still could 
not really believe in it — and 
Masatura-san nodded and 
reached for his hand. 

Rhame blinked at them diz- 
zily. Cornut had made him also 
take three large drinks — not be- 
cause Rhame had shown any 
signs of being telepathic, only 
because Cornut was not sure. It 
seemed like a drunken vision, 
the math teacher linking hands 
with the squat brown man, word- 
less. But it was no vision. 

After a moment Cornut re- 
leased the islander’s hand. Masa- 
tura-san nodded and, without a 
word, took the bottle from Cor- 
nut, drank deep, and passed it 
to his second in command, barely 
conscious on the ground behind 
him. 

“Let’s go,” said Cornut thickly, 
his eyes glazed. (It was hard to 
be just drunk enough! ) “We need 
a popper. Can you get one?” 

Rhame reached into his pock- 
et automatically and spoke brief- 
ly into his police radio before he 
asked questions. “What hap- 
pened?” 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



185 



Cornut wavered and caught 
his arm. “Sorry. It’s the im- 
mortals. You were right; they im- 
ported the smallpox carriers — 
went to a lot of trouble. But this 
fellow here, he’s a lot older than 
he looks. He can read minds, 
too.” 

The police radio squawked 
faintly. “They’ll meet us over 
near Med Center,” Rhame said, 
putting it back in his pocket. 
“Let’s go.” He was already mov- 
ing before he asked: “But where 
are we going?” 

Cornut was having difficulty 
walking. Everything was moving 
slowly, so slowly; his feet were 
like sausage-shaped balloons, he 
was wading through gelatine. He 
measured his movements care- 
fully, in a drunken, painstaking 
effort at clarity; he did not dare 
get really drunk, he did not dare 
become really sober. 

He said: “I know where the 
immortals are. He told me. Not 
words — holding my hand, mind 
to mind; physical contact helps. 
He didn’t know the name of the 
place, but I can find it in the 
popper.” 

Cornut stopped and looked 
astonished. “God, I am drunk. 
We’ll need some help.” 

Rhame said, stumbling over 
the words, “I’m drunk, too, but 
I figured that out for myself. The 
whole Emergency Squad is 
meeting us.” 



r T'HE cleared space near the 
Med Center was ideal for 
landing helipoppers, even though 
it was dotted now with prostrate 
figures, sick or exhausted. Rhame 
and Cornut heard the staccato 
bark and flutter of the helipop- 
pers and stood at the edge of the 
clear space, waiting. There were 
twelve police poppers settling 
toward them. Eleven poised 
themselves in air, waiting; the 
twelfth blossomed with search- 
lights and came on down. 

In the harsh landing light, one 
of the recumbent figures near 
them pushed himself up on an 
elbow, mumbling. His eyes were 
wide even in the blinding light. 
He stared at Cornut, his lips 
moving, and he cried faintly: 
“Carriers!” 

Rhame first realized the dan- 
ger. “Come on!” he said, begin- 
ning to trot, lurching, toward the 
landing popper. Cornut followed, 
but others were waking fever- 
ishly. 

“Carriers!” they cried, a few of 
them and then dozens. It was 
like the birth of a lynch mob. 
“Carriers! They did it to us! Get 
them!” Sick figures pushed them- 
selves to their knees, hands 
clutching at them. Some men, 
drooping in a knot, whirled and 
came toward them. “Carriers!” 

Cornut began to run. Carriers? 
Of course they were not carriers; 
he knew what it was. It was St. 



186 



GALAXY 



Cyr perhaps, or one of the others, 
unable to break through the bar- 
rier of alcohol to reach his own 
mind, working with the half- 
waking minds of the feverish or 
exhausted hundreds on the grass 
to attack and destroy them. It 
was quite astonishing, meditated 
one part of his mind with 
drunken gravity, that there were 
so many partial telepaths in this 
random crowd; but the other 
part of his mind cried Run, run! 

Stones began to fly, and from 
fifty yards away, across the 
green, Cornut heard a sound that 
might have been a shot. But the 
popper was whirling its blades 
above them now. They boarded 
it and it lifted, leaving the sud- 
den mob milling about below. 

The popper rose to join the 
rest of the squad. “That was just 
in time,” breathed Cornut to the 
pilot. “Thanks. Now head east 
until — ” 

The co-pilot was turning to- 
ward him, and something in his 
eyes stopped Cornut. He and 
Rhame acted together. As the co- 
pilot was reaching for his gun, 
the police sergeant brought up 
his fist. Co-pilot went one way, 
the gun another. Cornut jumped 
for the gun, pointed it at the 
pilot. “This is an emergency 
popper, right? With medical sup- 
plies?” 

Rhame understood at once. 
He leaped for the locker and 



broke out a half-liter of brandy 
in a sealed flask. He handed it 
to the pilot. “Drink!” he ordered. 
Then: “Get on the radio! Tell 
every man in the squad to take 
at least two ounces of brandy!” 
It was, thought Cornut fuzzily, 
a hell of a way to fight a war. 



XVI 

T>HAME was only a sergeant, 
but the pilot of the lead pop- 
per was a deputy inspector. The 
other helipoppers questioned the 
order, but they obeyed. The fleet 
sailed out over the bay, over the 
city, up toward the mountains. 

Under them, the city lay help- 
less, a giant killing-pen where 
blind crowds roamed in terror. 
Cornut could see, even from a 
thousand feet, the fires of 
wrecked vehicles, the litter of 
motionless bodies, the utter con- 
fusion that the plague had 
wrought. There had been by now, 
the deputy inspector said, more 
than ten thousand reported 
deaths in the city, but only a 
fraction of them were from 
smallpox. Accident and violence 
had slain the rest. How many 
deaths were unreported? Twice 
as many, a hundred times as 
many — there was no way of tell- 
ing. 

It was, Cornut knew, what the 
immortals wanted. They had 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



187 




kept their herd of short-lived 
cattle for a long time; the herd 
had increased until it threatened 
to deprive its unseen owners of 
space, food, everything. Like any 
herdsmen, the immortals had de- 
cided to thin it ’out. What could 
be more painless — for them — 
than a biological thinner? My- 
xomatosis had given Australia 
control of the rabbit swarm; 



smallpox could bring the human 
one under control. 

Cloudily, Cornut was able to 
read the motives of St. Cyr and 
the others, striking down those 
who like himself might learn of 
their existence, defeating re- 
search that might give them 
away by concealing it. It was a 
constant defensive action, and he 
could understand their need to 



188 



GALAXY 




remove every threat. He could 
forgive their attempts on his own 
life, he could forgive their killing 
of so much of a world. 

But he could not forgive the 
threat to Locille. For she was 
exposed. Some would survive the 
plague in any event — some al- 
ways did — but Cornut was a 
mathematician and he did not 
accept such odds. 



All these years, he mused, im- 
mortals were directing humanity 
in directions they chose. No won- 
der the great strides in medicine, 
no wonder the constant competi- 
tion between manufacturers to 
outdo each other producing lux- 
uries and comforts. What would 
happen to progress if the im- 
mortals were destroyed? 

And yet, he thought, begin- 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



189 




ning to sober up, wasn’t there 
something in Wolgren about 
that? No, not Wolgren. Some- 
where in statistical theory. Some- 
thing about random movements. 

The Brownian movement of 
molecules — that had been on 
Master Carl’s mind, he remem- 
bered. The Drunkard’s walk — 
the movement from a dead cen- 
ter ever smaller, asymptotically, 
never stopping. 

Straight-line progress was al- 
ways to an end. If the immortals 
directed it, it could go only so 
far as they could conceive, and 
no further. 

They were not the future, he 
realized with sharp clarity. They 
instigated — and let humanity do 
the solving, because they could 
solve nothing themselves. They 
were the old generations refusing 
to make way for the new, and 
the future was always the new 
generations, never the old, and 
— Cornut! said a shrill, angry 
voice in his brain. 

Panicky, he grabbed for the 
flask of medicinal brandy. The 
liquor supply was getting low. 
They would have to hurry; they 
dared not get sober. 

OENATOR Dane stirred angri- 
^ ly and crackled an oath with 
his mind that sent ripples of 
laughter through the party. Don’t 
laugh! he thought. I’ve lost them 
again! 



But was there real reason to 
worry? Senator Dane never 
drank, but he had observed the 
shorties drinking and he knew 
what drinking could do. They 
would pile up against a hill; they 
would crash into each other. Cer- 
tainly they would never find this 
place — although Masatura-san’s 
mind had been powerfully clear, 
and possibly there had been a 
leak, and — no, St. Cyr himself 
had selected Masatura-san’s tribe 
for the job of extermination and 
no one could conceal anything 
from St. Cyr. And the place was 
unfindable. 

It had been a resort hotel at 
one time, used for conventions 
of the sort that are not meant 
to be public, pre-empted from a 
gangster who had in turn pre- 
empted it from its not very legi- 
timate builders. The gangster 
had been a nuisance and the im- 
mortal who killed him had felt 
rather virtuous as he murdered a 
murderer. 

The hotel no longer had roads 
leading to it and there was no 
other habitation within twenty 
miles. That had been expensive, 
but, expense was the least im- 
portant factor in any of their 
plans. There was room for all of 
them, seventy-five immortals 
from every part of the world, 
children of sixty or sixty-five on 
up to the oldest, a man who had 
been born in the reign of Cali- 



190 



GALAXY 



gula. (There were few born be- 
fore the twentieth century, be- 
cause of the public-health con- 
tribution to their longevity, but 
those few seemed unwilling ever 
to die at all.) 

There were women who, with 
repeated plastic surgery, had 
managed to keep themselves in 
the general appearance, from a 
distance, of youth. There were 
visible ancients, like St. Cyr with 
his cyanosis and his scars, the 
squat old Roman with his great 
recurring keloids, the hairless, 
fat black man who had been 
born in slavery on the estate of 
the King’s Governor of Virginia. 
Color made no difference to 
them, nor race nor age; the fac- 
tor that counted was power. 
They were the strongest in the 
world, as they insured by killing 
off anyone potentially stronger. 

Not one had seen a war or an 
earthquake or a volcano at close 
range. Each had, for all of his 
prolonged life, surrounded him- 
self with walls and with guards. 
There were drawbacks to their 
lives, but not such a drawback 
as dying. 

In the hotel, staffed by Sudan- 
ese flown in a decade earlier — 
kept completely out of touch 
with the world and guarded from 
even chance contact with a wan- 
derer by a totally unfamiliar 
tongue — the immortals prepared 
to sit out the plague. Senator 



Dane wandered among them, 
jovial but inclined to worry. He 
annoyed them. The undertone 
of worry irritated. They chaffed 
him about it, in words of fifty 
languages (they knew them all) 
or in thoughts, with gesture and 
tone. But he infected them all. 

T^EAR is a relative thing. The 
man who is starving does not 
fear the early frost that may de- 
stroy the crops. He can only 
worry about what is close at 
hand. The well-fed man can 
worry years ahead. 

The immortals could worry a 
full century ahead. They looked 
far into the future, and every 
distant pebble in their path was 
a mountain. Suppose, mumbled 
the fear behind Dane’s jolly 
mask, that they do find our 
place here. True, we can destroy 
them with their minds, as we 
always have — but that is a nui- 
sance — and some of us may get 
hurt. This is our best place, but 
we have others, and staying far 
away from scenes of violence 
has always been the best policy 
for us. 

Shut up, thought (or said, or 
gestured) the others. 

He was interfering with their 
fun. The Roman was demon- 
strating a delicate balance of a 
feather on a soap-bubble (he 
was the strongest of them; it was 
hard to move physical objects 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



191 



with the mind, but with age it 
became possible). 

But the fear said: We have 
lost them. They might be any- 
where. (The bubble collapsed.) 
The fear said: Even if we flee, 
they are not stupid; they might 
search the house and find our 
own medics. And then — look 
then! Then they can end the 
plague, and, with not enough of 
them dead, billions of people will 
be hunting down us seventy-five! 
(The feather floated to the 
ground. The immortals shouted 
at Dane peevishly.) 

“Go,” said St. Cyr in his clock- 
tick voice, angry enough to speak 
aloud, “de-stroy the ser-um. Do 
not spoil our day!” 

Unwillingly Dane went. His 
mumbling worry stopped ab- 
ruptly, and cheerfully they went 
back to their enjoyment. It 
stopped abruptly for Dane too. 
He was in the downstairs hall, 
looking for one of the Sudanese, 
when he heard a sound behind 
him. But he was fat and he was, 
in spite of everything, very old. 
The blow caught him and he fell 
heavily. He was only vaguely 
conscious of the hands that 
rolled him over, the acrid taste 
of the liquid — was it brandy? 
But he never drank! — they were 
forcing down his throat. 

He did not know, but there 
were a dozen stumbling figures 
around him. As he began to re- 



cover consciousness, he knew, 
but then it was too late. It was 
so still! The voices in his mind 
were not speaking! The alcohol 
was a barrier; it deafened him, 
blinded him, marooned him; he 
had only eyes and mouth and 
ears, and for one whose life has 
been illuminated by the rapid 
flash of the mind itself, that is 
black silence. He began to sob, 
hardly noticing that the figures 
who had attacked him were now 
moving on toward the main hall, 
not noticing at all that they car- 
ried guns. 

XVII 

/"'ORNUT passed out com- 
'“' 4 pletely on the way back and 
slept soddenly for hours. Rhame 
let him sleep. There was time 
enough for everything now, even 
for sleep. The medics, with the 
restored tapes for the Stacks, had 
already begun the task of pre- 
paring vaccine; the captured 
hundred liters of serum was al- 
ready being rationed to the pub- 
lic. The mobs were quieted — it 
took only hope to end their ter- 
ror — and the danger, for most, 
was past. Not for all. The serum 
would never reach places in time 
for some, and there were many 
already dead. But the dead were 
only in the millions . 

Cornut woke up like an ex- 
plosion. 



192 



GALAXY 



His head was pounding; he 
staggered to his feet, ready to 
fight. Rhame, full of wake-up 
pills, reassured him quickly. “It’s 
all right. Look!” 

They were back in the city, 
in a hastily cleared penal wing 
of one of the hospitals. Along a 
corridor, room after room, there 
were old, old men and women, 
sleeping or staggering. 

“Twenty of them,” said Rhame 
proudly, “and every one guaran- 
teed to have one point five per 
cent of alcohol in the blood or 
better. We’ll keep them that way 
until we decide what to do next.” 
“Only twenty?” demanded 
Cornut, suddenly alarmed. “What 
about the others?” Rhame smiled 
like a shark. “I see,” said Cornut, 
visioning that queer contradic- 
tion, dead immortals. Better, he 
told himself, than a dead planet. 

He did not linger. Rhame had 
already phoned the campus and 
learned that Locille was well 
but still asleep, but Cornut 
needed to see her himself. 

A police popper took him to 
the campus in a pelting rain- 
storm and he ran through the 
wet grass. The grass was stained 
and littered; the windows of the 
Med Center showed where the 
mob had nearly smashed its way 
in. He hurried past, past the ab- 
original camp, now deserted, past 
the Administration Building, past 
the memory of Master Carl and 



the clinic where Egerd had died. 
The rain clouds stank of fumes 
from fires in the city; across the 
river there still lay thousands of 
unburied dead. 

But the clouds were thin and 
radiance was beginning to shine 
through. 

In his room, Locille stirred 
and woke. She smiled. 

“I knew you’d be back,” she 
said. 

He took her in his arms, but 
even in that moment he could 
not forget what Rhame had told 
him, what they had already 
learned from the drunken, bab- 
bling immortals. 

It was not short-lived humans 
the immortals had killed or 
driven to death — it was young 
immortals. The mutant gene was 
a dominant, and now that it had 
shown so often, it would soon 
fill the race. The immortals had 
not preserved themselves at the 
expense of a race that should 
have become extinct. They had 
only protected their own power 
against the Cornuts, the Locilles, 
the countless others with whom 
they refused to share. 

“I knew you’d be back,” she 
whispered again. 

“I told you I would,” he said. 
“I’ll always be back” . and he 
wondered how to tell her what 
“always” had suddenly come to 
mean for them.
