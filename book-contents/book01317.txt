KICK YOURSELF TO MARS 



A « some of tfie i>apcrs on tlie 
Orion Project and related mat- 
ters become declassified and avail- 
able, we beg'in to get a look at some 
of the ideas that went into it. 

Apparently that’s all we’re ever 
going to get — a look. The project 
was terminated over a year ago, and 
if there is any prospect of reviving 
interest in nuclear-powered space- 
ships in* this country, it is certainly 
well below the visible threshold. 

^ One of the interesting ideas put 
forth was a nuclear device that 
would propel ship«s across space by 
kicking them from behind. The es- 
sential energy is an explosion — as 
in a conventional rocket, or for that 
matter in the cylinders of your car. 



But the explosion would be nuclear 

— fission to start, fusion later on 

— and instead of occuring inside a 
combustion chamber it would, occur 
outside the ship entirely. The ex- 
plosion would take place in space, 
behind the ship. Its force, most of 
which would be wasted, would never- 
theless press against a spring- 
mounted, ablation-surfaced butt- 
plate at the stem of the ship; and 
that thrust would propel the vessel. 
Literally it would be forced through 
space by a series of kicks from out- 
side. 

Wasteful? Most of the energy 
would dissipate itself into space, 
true — but with nuclear reactions 
there is a great deal of energy for 



4 





a small amounit of fuel mass; and 
that is the critical factor. Shocks? 
No doubt there would be, no matter 
how elegantly and massively sprung 
the sihock ab^rbers. But the design- 
ers assure us they would be toler- 
able. And the advantages would be 
great. To name just one, it would 
be possible to leave such a vessel, on 
the surface of another planet if de- 
sired, without automatically com- 
mitting suicide. Few other ssrstems 
for utilizing nuclear reactions for 
thrust can make this claim ... 

But it isn^t really important 
whether this particular system is 
better than another, when it seems 
clear that national policy is solidly 
set against any use of nuclear power 
for spacecraft. The choice of one 
system over another is basically a 
matter of engineering. The decision 
to throw all nuclear systems down 
the drain is a matter of politics. 

Since the proponents of nuclear- 
propelled spacecraft claim that in 
five years such vessels could do 
anything we now do with chemical 
rockets in space exploration — and 
go on to reach any planet of the 
solar system, in a matter of a few 
months for a round trip, bearing 
up to a dozen men and 500 tons of 
supplies in the process — shouldn't 
we go on with the investigations, at 
least? 

It isn't as though there were in- 
calculable amounts of money in- 
volved. Orion, at its present stage, 
could be nurtured on as little as 
one or two million dollars a year — 
less than a thousandth of the cost 
of our present space program, for a 
system which may well make chemi- 
cal space rockets as obsolete as the 
square-rigger. 

So why not go on with it? 



T here turn out to be several 
‘Vhy nets". Why Not #1 ia 
that Idiere just isn't a ready-made 
home for Project Orion in our space 
program. Each agency has had its 
duties spelled out for it. None has 
been charged with the responsibility 
for applying nuoleair energy to the 
overall task. 

Why Not #2 is a dassit example 
of the road that good intentions 
pave. In the Atomic Test Ban 
Treaty there is a provision against 
atomic explosions in outer space. 
The obvious intention of the signa- 
tories was to prevent nuclear war in 
space, and maybe more immediately 
to prevent disasters like Project 
Starfish. Which was our military 
spacemen's go at firing off a bomb 
up there to see what would happen. 
What happened was that the Van 
Allen belt was bent out of shape 
for the first time in a billion years, 
three satellites were destroyed and 
the lights in Public Information Of- 
fices burned all night as the mimeo- 
graphs cranked out statements that 
it wasn't really important that this 
unexpected thing had happened, be- 
cause after all nobody got killed,) 
But the treaty now prohibits us- 
ing nuclear explosions even to drive 
spaceships, though one would as- 
sume all parties would be willing 
to modify it in that respect if con- 
vinced it were worth while. 

Why Not #3, the dea<Biest of all, 
is pure inertia. To chemical rockets, 
preferably liquid-fuel ones, we are 
commited, and with them we will 
stay. 

We may yet kick ourselves from 
here to Mars — if not with Project 
Orion, then out of emharrassment 
because we dropped it!

“This is the place, Bella,” Raff 
Cornay said. “By God, we’re a long 
way from home.” 



Bella smiled up at him and bit 
her dyed lips. Having them dyed 
hadn’t really made her look twenty 
years younger — or even a year 
younger. She moved closer to his 
side, put lean, grayish fingers on his 
thick, brown arm, looking up the 
dark ravine of the stairway. 

“Raff, it’s so . .” she started 
and then left it, because when you’ve 
been married twenty years all those 
words aren’t necessary.

EARTHBLOOD 




Raff hitched at the harness that 
crossed his heavy, rounded shoul- 
ders, brushed with a finger the com- 
forting bulge of the short-barrelled 
power pistol. 

“We’ll be all right, Bella.” He 
patted her thin hand, moved ahead 
of her to the high, narrow steps, 
worn into hollows pocketing oily 
puddles. The heat and sounds of 
the plaza faded as they climbed 
through layered odors of decay and 
alien cookery, passed a landing 
railed with twisted iron, reached 
a towering, narrow doorway hung 
with a" dirt-glazed beaded arras that 
clashed softly as Raff held it aside. 

There was a leathery rustle, a 
heavy thump, the clack of clawed 
feet. An enormously tall, stooped 
figure in ornately decorated straps 
and bangles minced forward from 
yellowish gloom, ruffling moulting 
plumage. It settled itself on a tall 
stool, clattering stiff, flightless 
feathers, blinking translucent eye- 
lids from Raff to Bella. 

“What do you want?” the creature 
rasped. “There is no charity here.” 

“The lady’d like to sit down too, 
maybe,” Raff said sharply. 

“Then sit.” 

Raff looked around. There was 
no other chair. He looked at the 
proprietor, eyeing the red, leathery 
neck, the t&rnished beak. 

“I never knew one like you be- 
fore,” he said. “What are you, you 
don’t know how to treat a human 
lady?” 

“Human?” The alien clacked its 
beak contemptuously, staring at 
Bella’s gray Yill skin. 

“Don’t, Raff.” Bella put her hand 



on his arm. “We don’t care noth- 
ing about him. All wc want’s the 
baby.” Through the ill-fitting youth 
«uit he had bought for the trip, she 
could feel him forcing himself not 
to care. Maybe he was too old for 
the legal adoption agency, but he 
was as good as any man a hundred 
years younger. 

“We’ve got money,” Raff said 
tightly. “We’re here on business.” 
The big eyes blink€;d at him. 
“How much money?” 

“Well — almost five hundred 
credits.” 

T he tall creature on the stool 
closed its eyes, opened them 
again. “I can offer you something 
in a sturdy mute, guaranteed I.Q. 
of 40 . 

“No,” Raff and Bella said to- 
gether. “No defective stock,” Raff 
went on. “Your sign down on the 
square said Genuine Terry Strain.” 
‘Too much intellect in a slave 
is undesirable. Now, this line of 
stock . .” 

“You think we’d make a slave of 
a human child?” Raff snapped. 
“Can’t you see we’re Terries — 
Terry stock, anyway,” he added, as 
the round eyes flicked over him, 
then Bella. She stirred and wrapped 
her cloak closer. 

The dealer clacked its beak con- 
temptuously, “Five hundred credits! 
And for this, I should produce per- 
haps a Conquistador, complete with 
Sc. D. certificate?” 

“Just an ordinary boy,” Raff 
said. “Just so he’s normal. Earth 
normal. We don’t mind if he’s may- 
be color-blind.” 




The dealer cocked its head, eyed 
Raff. “What kind of citizenship do 
you have?” 

“What? Why, weTc Freeholders, 
from Granfont.” 

“You have papers?” 

“Sure. Otherwise we*d never . 
The dealer half turned, raised its 
voice in a sharp cry. A small slave 
in trailing rags came in from a side 
room. 

“Bring benches for my valued cus- 
tomers — and brandy. The Fleon, 
*49.” It turned back to Raff, its 
hooded eyes sharp and interested 
now. “A happy blending of rain, 
sun, sulphur and fungi.” 

“We don’t need the build-up,” 
Raff said. “We didn’t come here to 
socialize.” He stopped. It wasn’t a 
thing you could put words to. We 
came to buy a human child to 
buy a son. 

“Ah, but I like people with re- 
sources. I confide in them.” The 
dealer was beaming owlishly now. 
“You wash an heir. I understand. 
You have come at a fortunate time. 
I can offer a most exceptional em- 
bryo — a son fit for an emperor!” 
“We’re not emperors,” Raff said. 
“Just plain folks. We want a plain 
Terry boy.” 

“So.” 'The dealer ruffled limp 
shoulder plumes indifferently, his 
expression abruptly cold again. “If 
you want to rear inferior stock, 
I can sell you something cheap.” 
“Good. How much?” Raff rose, 
resting his hand on his credit coder. 

“Wait!” Bella cried. “I want to 
know what he means. What’s the . , 
the other kind you was talking 
about?” She pulled Raff back into 



his chair as the slave returned with 
a tray bearing a clay pot and bell- 
shap^ glasses. 

The dealer placed spidery, 
plucked-chicken fingers together, 
waiting while the dave poured and 
withdrew. He cocked an eye at 
Bella. 

“As it happens, I am in a posi- 
tion to offer top price for free-hold 
citizenships.” 

4 1 A re you crazy?” Raff started. 

“How’d wc ever get back?” 

Bella picked up a glass and said, 
“Wait, Raff.” She made a great 
thing of sipping the brandy, mak- 
ing it a compliment. 

“Sell our citizensibips!” Raff 
snorted. “It takes us for ignorant 
rubes. Bella.” 

The creature hunched on its 
stool, fragile feathers raised in a 
halo around its head, eyes on Bella 
now. 

“I happen, at this moment, to 
have in my tanks,” it said with 
impressive gravity, “a prime-quality 
fetus intended for the personal ser- 
vice of — a most high official. A 
magnificent blastophere, large, vig- 
orous and of a superior intellectual 
potentiality.” 

“What’s wrong with it, this high 
official didn’t take delivery?” Raff 
asked bluntly. 

The round eyes blinked. “Alas, 
the Shah is . er . dead — to- 
gether with his heirs and assigns. 
One of these annoying uprisings of 
the rabble. By great good luck, an 
agent of mine — But no matter. I

quisition of this prize, which now.

•ee.** 

“This is just sales talk, Bella,” 
Raff said. ‘To build up the price.” 

“A rustic’s shrewdness is the 
fnerdhant’s joy,” the dealer quoted 
sharply. It raised its head and 
shrilled for the slave again, chirped 
instructions. Raff and Bella waited. 
The slave returned, toiling under a 
small, glittering, stone-encrusted box. 
At a sign from the dealer, it handed 
the casket to Raff. He took it; his 
hands sagged under the unexpected 
weight. 

“This golden incubator, set with 
diamonds, aiwaited the favored tot. 
Now heavy-footed bucolics haggle 
for his destiny. The price is three 
thousand credits — or two freehold 
citizenships.” 

“That’s twice the going black- 
market price,” Raff said weakly, 
overwhelmed by the box and what 
was in it. 

“You’re not bargaining for black- 
market goods now. I’m a ligitimate 
trader, licensed by the Sodomate.” 

“I’ll give you one citizenship,” 
Raff said. “Mine. I can earn an- 
other with a few years work.” 

The dealer snapped horny lips 
together. “I’d decant this jewel 
among lad^ into the hive sewers be- 
fore I’d cut my price a demichit! 
The. descendant of kings deserves 
no less.” 

“Raff . .” Bella said, appeal 
in her voice. 

“How do we know he’s telling 
the truth, Bella?” 

“I have a license to protect, 



lander,” the tall creature said. “You 
think I’d risk my reputation for 
your paltry custom? The Shah paid 
fifty thousand Galactic credits in 
rhodium ingots!” 

“But if you don’t sell it quick — ” 
“I’ve told you my price. Take it 
or leave it — and then get out.” 
“Well . .” Raff hesitated. 

“We’ll take it,” Bella said. 

T hey moved through the noise of 
the plaza. Raff leading the way 
among hawkers’ stalls, Bella clutch- 
ing a two-inch glass cylinder to her 
lean chest. Yellow dust swirled, 
stirred by a fitful desert wind. The 
second sun was low in a bronze- 
black sky. 

“We shouldn’t have spent all that 
credit,” Raff said. “How’re we go- 
ing to get back, Bella?” 

“We’ll find a way,” Bella said. 
“But first, we got to find a Man 
doctor.” 

Raff halted. “Bella! You ain’t 
coming down sick?” 

“We got to have the baby im- 
planted right away. Raff.” 

“Bella, you know we can’t afford 
that now. We’ll wait ’till we’re back 
on Granfont, like we planned.” 

“We thought we’d have time. 
Raff. But we don’t. He’d never have 
sold so cheap if time hadn’t been 
short — awful short.” 

“But we were going to use Ten’s 
stock brooder. Where’d we ever 
find a mammal brooder here? And 
we’d have to stay nine months — ” 
“We won’t have to stay, Raff. 
I’ll have the baby implanted — in 
me. 

Raff stared at her. “Bella — you 




sure? I mean, could you . could 

it . r 

She nodded. “I asked Doctor 
about it once, a long time ago. He 
said — first he took a lot of tests 
— and then he said I could.” 

“But Bella, you’re . you’re 
not . 

“He said I could — even if I’m 
not human.” Her vertical-slitted 
eyes were bright in her still-piquant 
face. “I’ll be the mother of our 
son, Raff. He’ll be our human boy, 
born to me.” 

Beside Bella, Raff raised his head 
suddenly. He moved closer to Bella, 
put a protective arm around her 

“What is it, Raff?” 

“Bella — somebody’s following 
us.” 

“Following . why?” 

“I don’t know. Give me the boy. 
And stay close.” 

They turned into a canyon with 
harsh lights, pushing through the 
jostling crowd. Alien hands plucked 
at their sleeves, alien eyes stared, 
alien voices implored, cursed, 
begged, threatened. The dust rose, 
hot and corrosive. 

“Down here,” Raff gasped. In 
the shelter of a narrow way they 
clung together, coughing. 

“We Wouldn’t have left the main 
plaza,” Bella said. “Tourists don’t 
come here.” 

“Come on.” Raff led the way, 
thirty feet back, when the twisted 
path ended between high walls in 
a cul-de-sac. They turned. 

Two figures, one squat, one tall, 
bath wrapped in heavy, dun-colored 
togas, waited at the alley-mouth. 

“Stay behind me.” Ruff tucked 



the cylinder in a harness pouch, 
put his hand inside bis tunic to 
rest on the pistol butt, started for- 
ward; the short creature came to 
meet him, waddling on thick, bowed 
legs. Ten feet apart, they halted. 
Raff looked down into dead eyes 
like black opals in a face of bleached 
and pocked wood. 

“We are stronger than you,’’ the 
alien grated. “Give* us the royal 
slave and go in peace.” 

R aff brought the gun into view. 

There was blue stain across his 
throat where the cheap dye of the 
youth suit had dissolved in sweat. 

“Get out of our way.” His dry 
mouth made his voice rasp. 

There was a moment of silence. 
Then: 

“We will pay,” the alien said. 
“How much?” 

“I’ll sell you nothing. Just clear 
out of my way.” Raff licked sweat 
from his upper lip. 

The tall alien had moved up be- 
hind his dwarf companion. Beyond 
them a heavy, lizard-bodied Minid 
with a scaled hide painted in garish 
colors moved into view, and behind 
him were others. 

Raff took a step forward. The 
gun was almost touching the dusty 
folds of the other’s toga. “Out of 
my way or I’ll shoot sure as Hell!” 
A stumpy arm whipped out; Raff 
fired — a momentary flare of blue; 
then the gun was flying as the 
weight of the alien slammed against 
him, and he reeled back, grappling 
for a hold on horny hide. He 
caught a sinewy arm, twisted with 
all his strength, heard gristle creak.

snap. He hurled the alien from 
him, leaped past him, swung at 
the tall one, missed as he leaned 
aside. The gun lay two yards away. 

He dived for it — and a vaat 
weight slammed against him, driving 
out his breath in an explosive grunt. 
He was aware of the roughness of 
the cobbles against his face, a fiery 
pain that rolled in waves from his 
sihoulder. Far away, Bella’s voice 
wailed. 

Raff rolled over and came to his 
knees. A wide foot in a ragged san- 
dal smashed at his face. He caught at 
it, held on, dragged a kicking, fight- 
ing body down, hearing himself cry 
out at the agony in his shoulder; 
and then he found a grip on yield- 
ing flesh and clung, crushing, feeling 
cartilage crackle under his thumbs. 
He grunted, hunching his shoulders 
as talons raked across his face once, 
twice, then scrabbled and fell away. 
Then hard hands hauled at him, 
threw him on his back. He struck 
out blindly, rolling over to protect 
the cylinder with his body. 

He tried to crawl toward the gun, 
but a boulder, falling from an im- 
mense height, had crushed his body 
and his lungs were charred pits in 
his chest. His arms and legs moved, 
though he had forgotten now why 
he must crawl .... 

A last, brilliant light flared and 
died into bottomless darkness, and 
Raff felt himself fading, fading, 
winking out .... 

H e lay on his back, hearing their 
voices. 

“This one fights like a scalded 
dire-beast!” 



“. cartilage like rods of gran- 
ite!” 

“Break them ...” 

The blows were remote, like dis- 
tant thunder. The beating went on 
for a long tkne. Raff didn’t notice 
when it stopped; he floated in a 
silence like a sea of molten lead. 
But voices penetrated the silence. 
There was the deep rumble of one 
who demanded, and a thin cry . 
Bella. 

Raff moved an arm, .groped over 
his face, wiped blood from his 
eyes, feeling broken flesih under 
his fingers. He blinked, and through 
a red blur saw Bella, held pinned 
against a wall by a cloaked figure. 
Its arm rose and fell, rose and fell 
again .... 

Raff reached, groping. His hand 
fell on the power pistol. He tried 
to sit up, coiled away from agony 
like a worm on a hook. He dragged 
the gun around, leveled it on the 
yellow cloak and fired. The cloak 
crumpled. Another caught at Bella, 
whirled her around as a shield. 

“You will kill your woman,” a 
thin voice said flatly. “Give us what 
we seek and go your way. We are 
stronger than you.” 

Raff was watching Bella. She 
hung in the grip of the alien, small, 
limp. He saw her hand move — 
“Why do you struggle so, foolish 
one?” the alien grated. 

“Leave . us . alone,” Raff 
managed. Bella’s hand was at her 
girdle. It fumbled, came away. Light 
glinted on steel. Raff saw the thin 
arm grope, finding the vulnerable 
spot between plates of scale-armor 
— then sudden movement —

There was a grunt froon the crea- 
ture who held Bella. He leaned, 
fell stiffly, the handle of Beta’s 
rat-tail poinard against his side. Be- 
hind her, a dark s'hape moved. Raff 
fired, a near miss. But the alien 
halted, called out in a strange 
tongue. Raff blinked gummed eyes, 
aiming. 

“Wait, Raff,” Bella called. She 
spoke rapidly, incomprehensibly. 
The alien answered. Raff held the 
gun aimed at the voice. 

Bella was beside him. “Raff, this 
one’s a Yill — like me. He gave 
me his parole.” 

“Parole, hell!” Raff croaked. 

“Raff, if we spare his life, he’ll 
be our slave. It’s true, Raff. Its 
the Yill law. And we need him.” 

The gun fell from Raff’s hand. He 
tried to reach for it, to curse the 
weakness, but only a thin moan 
came. 

There was a babble of alien talk, 
Bella’s voice a thin thread against 
the rumble of the other. Raff tried 
aeain. 

^ “ . Bella ...” 

“Yes, Raff. It’ll be all right now. 
T’hoy hoy will take us to a 
place ...” 

“Use the gun,” Raff gasped out. 
“Make srure of the rest of ’em — all 
of ’em.” 

“Raff — if we just go now — ” 

“No good, Bella. No law in this 
place. Taking no chances. There’ll 
be no wounded devils tracking 
us ... ” 

Afterwards, there was a confused 
memory of strong arms that carried 
him, and pain like a blanket of fire, 
and the bite of the night wind, sud- 



denly cold; and later, voices, die 
chnk of keys, and at last a nest of 
smouldering furs, and Bdla’s hands, 
and her warm breath against his 
face. 

“Raff! Poor Raff ” 

He tried to speak, gasped, tried 
again. “Our boy,” he said,^ It was 
important to explain it to Bella, 
so she’d see how it ^as. “Our boy. 
Bought with money and bought with 
blood. He’s our boy now, Bella.” 

L eaning heavily on his cane. Raff 
looked down at his wife and his 
new born son while the slave T’hoy 
hoy washed out rags in the tin tub 
by the door. 

“This ain’t the way I meant it 
to be,” Raff said. “Here in this 
fallen down shack in the ghetto. 
Gee, Bella — ” 

“When you get more able you 
can paint it pretty and white. And 
it’s on the other side of Tambool 
from the bazaar. They won’t look 
for him here. Roan.” 

“My son,” Raff said, touching 
one tiny, curled fist. “In fifty years, 
maybe, he’ll be a full grown human 
man.” 

I 

R oan was bored watching his 
mother wash dishes. 

“No,” s*he said. “I can’t take you 
outside now. After I do the dishes 
I got to grind the grits and then 
shell some snails and clean your 
daddy’s brushes so’s he can do some 
spring painting when he gets back 
from that job in town. And then 
. stop that!” Bella cried.

Roan tried to stick the paper 
back on the wall but it wouldn’t 
stay. 

“Daddy fix,” he said. His nose 
was running and he wiped it on the 
end of the curtain. 

''Not on the curtain,” Bella said. 
“I just washed them and I didn’t 
make no more soap yet.” 

Roan reached for the salt cup. 
Salt was a nice thing to taste, a 
little at a time. Only it all came 
over on him. 

“The saltV Bella screeched. “Now 
that’s the end! Raff worked all 
day one day just to get that salt 
for you and there it’s all over the 
floor and how I’m going to wash 
salt?” 

Roan began to wail again. Every- 
thing he did was bad. 

“All right,” Bella said. “All 
right. I guess maybe you could go 
out in the back. You stay near 
the house. And don’t get into no 
trouble, and leave them ohunck 
flowers alone. That juice don’t wash 
out.” 

Roan ran out into the sunshine 
with a whoop of joy. He could 
taste the sun all over him except 
where his clothes were. 

O, what lovely chunck flowers! 
Purpler than purple-fruit, redder 
than blood, greener than grass. 

Musn’t pick the chunck flowers. 

He wandered to the other side of 
the yard where it trailed off into a 
dust lot beyond the careful picket 
fence that Daddy was going to 
paint again soon. 

Roan liked to pick the flakes of 
old paint off it, but today something 
more interesting was there. 



On the other side of the fence 
were a bunch of wiry, leathery Mttlc 
gracyl children, and oh, what fun 
they were having! 

“Hello!” Roan called. “Hey! Hi! 
Come play!” 

Some of them looked up. 

“You’re not a gracyl three,” one 
of them said. 

"Here is where the three-year 
gracyls dig, not there.'* 

"I can help,” Roan said. “Help 
dig.” 

He began to clamber over the 
fence. It was hard work and he tore 
a long strip off his shirt on the top 
of a picket. 

Then, once over, he was suddenly 
shy and stood and watched the 
gracyl threes burrowing into the 
ground, their sharp claws working 
quickly. 

“Me, too!” he cried then, and 
started in on a gr acyl’s burrow. The 
gracyl kicked him disinterestedly and 
kept on burrowing, and Roan burst 
into tears and went to help an- 
other, and got kicked again. 

“Dig your own burrow,” one of 
them finally said, not unkindly. 
Roan could see he was a little dif- 
ferent from the others. One em- 
bryonic wing had failed to develop. 

“You don’t got a wing bone,” 
Roan said. “Where you wing bone?” 

The gracyl stretched out his one 
good wing into an infant fan. “They 
grow later,” he said. “You don’t 
have any wings.” 

Roan tried to feel beneath his 
arms but he couldn’t find anything. 

“I’m going to grow my wings 
later,” he said excitedly. “Then Y\\ 
fly. I’m Roan.”

IF 




“I’m Clanth,” his new friend said, 
and then noticed the others had 
already burrowed ahead of him. 
“Shut up and dig.” 

Roan began to dig and found 
out almost immediately it wasn’t as 
easy as it looked. The dirt at the 
top was loose, and came right out, 
but underneath the ground got 
damp and harder. 

“Mama cutted my fingernails,” 
Roan said bitterly. He knew she 
shouldn’t have cut his fingernails 
and now look — he couldn’t dig like 
everybody else. 

Roan went and found a sharp 
stick and began to do a little bet- 
ter. He hit hard with it and sud- 
denly a hole opened up all by itself. 
A nice, big hole and Roan crawled 
into it and a gracyl came up and 
punched him and said, “Dig your 
own burrow, you freak.” 

Roan took his stick and began 
digging down some more. 

“You’re doing it wrong,” the 
gracyl said, and went on lengthen- 
ing his burrow. 

B ut as Roan gouged at the earth, 
it fell in again, and he was in 
another burrow and it was quite 
dark and a little cold, but Roan 
crawled fivrther along into the bur- 
row and then he ran into something 
furry that he couldn’t see in the 
dark. 

“That’s funny,” Roan said aloud 
and laughed, because something was 
tickling the inside of his mind. 

*'Here it is lovely and cool and 
dark and no winds blow. Here live 
we Seez and who are you?” 

“I’m Roan,” Roan said aloud. 



The See put out a soft claw and 
felt Roan. **You do not feel likt 
you look in your mind,” it said. 
**There are no wings and no dig' 
ging claws. Tell me again what 
you are.” 

“I’m Roan,” Roan said, and 
laughed again. And then there was 
a silence in Roan’s mind while the 
creature felt around in it, and be 
waited, feeling strange.* 

**There*s something amiss with 
you,” the See said. Roan felt him 
backing off. *'You can*t tell me 
who you are. And some terrible 
power lurks there in your mind. And 
such enormous puzzles, and things 
that are strange . .** 

Roan could feel a shudder from 
the creature’s mind and then it 
was gone and he was alone. Alone 
in the dark cold, with all those 
strange things die See said were 
in his mind. And the ground smelled 
dead and damp and wormy and 
there might be Qiarons crawling 
through the burrows to eat dead 
things and suppose they thought he 
was dead? 

Roan started to back out and 
found he was scared and all he 
wanted was Daddy or Mama and 
his own bed. He sat down and 
opened his mouth and howled. 

The tears poured out of his eyes 
and he felt dirt in his mouth and 
he screamed with all his body and 
he was wet, now, too, and that 
made everything worse. 

Then he felt Raffs strong hands 
on him and even though he knew it 
was Raff he had to go on scream- 
ing to show how scared he had 
been. 



EARTHBLOOD

“Boy,” Raff said when he got him 
out and the screams quieted to 
sobs. “Boy, I been looking all over 
for you.” Daddy sounded funny. 
Daddy was scared, too. 

“And I’m going to do something I 
never done before. I’m going to give 
you a good lickin’.” 

And he turned Roan over his 
knee, but Roan didn’t mind the 
licking. By the time it was over 
he’d stopp^ crying altogether and 
he got up and looked solemnly at 
his father and Bella, who was hys- 
terical and hollering for Raff to 
bring Roan in for a bath. 

Roan wiped his nose on the back 
of his hand and said, “What am 
I?” 

. “You,” Raff said, “are a human 
boy. And some day you’ll be a 
human Man. Pure Terran you are, 
boy.” 

“But I got funny ears,” Roan 
said, feeling one ear, because sud- 
denly it seemed as though it was 
mostly his ears, his funny, rounded 
ears on the side of his head, that 
might be the cause of all his trouble 
and misery. 

4 4T^^hat’s Terran?” Roan asked 
^▼T’hoy hoy, as the Yill slave 
carefully washed him in a big wood- 
en tub of hot water, while Bella 
hovered, checking. 

“Terran?” T’hoy hoy echoed. 
“Well, a Terran is from Terra.” 
“Uncle T’hoy hoy know a song 
about Terra?” Roan asked hopeful- 
ly. Roan knew from his voice that 
he did. T’hoy hoy had a special 
way of pronouncing things he knew 
stories about. Sort of sing-song, like 



he said the stories, speaking the 
ancient, melodic language of the 
Yill. 

“Yes. And if you stand still while 
I wash you and then eat ail yova 
dinner and go right to bed. I’ll be 
telling you the story.” 

“Oh, yes!” Roan said. “Yes and 
yes and yes and yes!” And he made 
a big splash in the water, but then 
he really was still and T’hoy hoy 
began his story. 

“Once upon a time, longer ago 
than the oldest qreature in the 
oldest world can remember now, 
there was a world called Terra.” 

“Is it still there?” 

“We’ll get to that later. A long 
time ago, and so far away you can’t 
even see its sun in the sky from 
Tambool, there lived people on the 
world named Terra, and these people 
all looked just like you.” 

“Like me!” Roan’s eyes grew 
wide, and he stood even stiller than 
he needed to. “With funny ears?” 
“Your ears aren^t funny,” T’hoy 
hoy said. “Not to a Terry. Now, 
one day these Terrians built the first 
spaceships that ever were. A whole 
new kind of thing that had never 
been built before. Only Terrans 
could do that. Then the Terrans 
went to other worlds in their space- 
ships and after thousands of years, 
creatures all over the universe 
learned that those twinkles in the 
sky were stars with worlds around 
them. Because previously each 
world had thought it was the only 
one. And each thought it had the 
only God, whereas there are actually 
nine Gods. 

“And Terrans learned to live on 



16 



IF 




thase many worlds, but some of 
them changed, and on many worlds 
they met other beings, not human, 
but not too different.” 

Roan sat down in the warm bath 
water because he was getting goose 
bumps standing in the cold air. 
“You not a Terran,” he said, touch- 
ing T’hoy hoy’s Yill ear. 

“No, I’m all Yill, as far as I 
know. But these people began to 
build things of their own and do 
many Terran things. And since 
these worlds sold things to one an- 
other, and visited each other, pretty 
soon they also began to have wars, 
because each wanted to be the 
strongest. So the men of Terra de- 
cided to rule the universe and keep 
the peace.” 

“I got soap in my mouth,” Roan 
said. “Tase’s terrible.” 

T’hoy hoy carefully wiped the in- 
side of Roan’s mouth with a damp 
cloth. 

“Then something very unhappy 
happened. Strange people came, 
from far away — on the other side of 
the Galaxy — or maybe even from 
another Galaxy — and their weap- 
ons were strange but powerful and 
they challenged Terra for the over- 
lordship of the Universe. And they 
fought a great war that lasted for 
a thousand years.” 

“Naughty,” Roan said. He could 
tell from the tone of Uncle T’hoy 
hoy’s voice. "'Very naughty,” 

“Yes, indeed,” T’hoy hoy said, 
“These bad people were called the 
Niss, and such was their power 
that even great Terra couldn’t de- 
feat them.” 

“Is they kill the Terrans dead?” 



“No. They put a circle of armed 
Niss spaceships around the planet 
Terra. And after that no one could 
get to Terra and the Terrans 
couldn’t go anywhere. So nobody 
has been to Terra for these five 
thousand years.” 

“What’s five thousand years?” 
Roan asked, jumping from Hhe tub 
into the drying cloth T’hoy hoy 
held for him. Roair loved to be 
dried in the lovely, warm cloth and 
he liked to wear it wrapped around 
him while T’hoy hoy got his 
clothes together. 

“A long, long time. I’m not even 
sure how long. But the story says 
five thousand years, so that’s what 
I say.” 

At dinner Roan crammed food 
into his mouth with both hands and 
Raff and Bella were too exhausted 
to make him try to use his spoon. 

“This how Terrans eat,” Roan 
said, to excuse himself. “Terrans do 
this.” And he filled his mouth so 
full his cheeks bulged out. 

“Terrans do not do that,” Raff 
said. “And beginning tomorrow 
night you’ll always cat like a Ter- 
ran.” 

And T’hoy hoy began to tell Roan 
how Terrans eat and what Terrans 
cat, but Roan was asleep before 
Thoy hoy could get past the hors 
d’oeuvres. 

II 

oan’s turn came. 

The others were already 
across. Except the gracyl who’d 
fallen, and was probably dead by 
now.

Everybody’s wings had worked, 
the young, pink membranes fan- 
ning out along their torsos, along 
under their arms — all but Clanth’s. 
He hadn’t even tried. He had looked 
down into the ravine and then gone 
home alone. 

They were aM laughing, on the 
other side of the ravine. First at 
themselves, because it was so much 
fun, and then at Roan, because he 
was hesitating. 

It had been easy. They were 
proud of their wings, amused be- 
cause that one gracyl had managed 
his wings badly and had fallen. He 
hadn’t been clever. Now they 
watched Roan, the only one not 
over. 

“Roan is the dumbell of the Sev- 
ens,” they began to chant, flapping 
their wings at him. “Roan is stoo- 
oo-pid.“ 

“I’m going to do it,” he called. 
“Just watch me.” 

But still he hesitated. He didn’t 
have any wings. 

The idea was to take the rope 
vine, which was just long enough 
to swing three-fourths of the way 
across Endless Ravine, and swing 
out into the dizzy air, and then 
sail the rest of the way across 
on your own power. 

Roan tested the rope vine, swing- 
ing softly on it, looking up to 
where it hung from high, high in 
the Purplefruit Tree, and then look- 
ing across Endless Ravine, across 
the^ impossible distance to where 
the other Seven Yearers stood. 

Roan’s pink face was drenched 
with perspiration, his tunic pasted 
to his child’s body. 



He eking to the swaying rope and 
thought of how it would be if he 
just let go and ran home. Ma would 
say, “What did you do today?” 
and he’d say, “Nothing,” and the 
day would end, just like any other 
day. 

“StoopidI” they called. “Roan is 
a dumbell.” 

They’d said that before, that way, 
about other things, and Roah had 
decided it wasn’t going to happen 
again. No — he’d show them, show 
them, show them — and some day 
there’d be something he could do 
that they couldn’t do. 

Roan made himself relax, muscle 
by muscle, as Ma had taught him 
to do when he was angry and 
couldn’t go to sleep. All I think 
about is getting to the other side, 
he said to himself, and didn’t men- 
tion the Ravine. He measured the 
distance with his eyes and gatiged 
the swing of the rope vine with his 
whole body. 

With luck, he’d make it. 

Roan ran back with the rope 
vine, as far as it would go. Then 
he clung, feeling himself part of 
the arc of the swinging, willing the 
swing to be far enough, forcing 
himself to know when the top of 
the arc came, to let go at just the 
right moment. 

The air was in his ears and the 
mouth of the ravine opened to swal- 
low him, but his eye was on the 
soft pasture grass of the other side, 
and he let go at the apogee of 
the swing. Then, not knowing 
whether he would land or not, he 
relaxed himself for the landing, 
feeling the whistle of the air .

IF 




He struck, rolled freely to lessen 
the impact of the earth on his soft 
human body, hardly feeling as his 
foot caught briefly, then rolled free 
with him. 

He laughed up at the group of 
empty faces. Somewhere inside of 
him something was pumping him 
in and out, as if he were a pair 
of bellows. 

“Yah, I did it better than any 
of you,” he said, and jumped up 
to walk off and show it hadn’t been 
anything. “Yah,” he said. 

And fell down and went black. 

H e awakened slowly, into red 
and green flashes of pain, and 
he couldn’t see anything but glar- 
ing sunlight. The other children 
had gone. They’d figured he was 
just dead. 

If this was what death was, some- 
body ought to care. 

Ma and Dad would care. 

Roan started pulling himself 
along by his hands and his right 
knee. His left foot pulsed with 
pain that flared up his leg and 
into his groin. He had to peer 
through the brilliant sunshine as 
though it were a fog, to see which 
way home was. He would have to 
crawl to the swinging bridge over 
Endless Ravine, and across it, and 
then across more countryside to 
home. 

Up the hillock and down, his 
dead, screaming foot dragging use- 
lessly behind him. Roan wanted 
to die at home. Or not die, if Dad 
could fix him. But he wasn’t go- 
ing to lie and die where he was, 
as the gracyls did. 



His foot bumped over a sharp 
stone, caught in a prickle bush. The 
prickle bush uprooted and clung to 
the dragging foot like a great in- 
sect, like the Oharons that cleaned 
the flesh off gracyl bodies. 

That gracyl lying at the bottom 
of Endless Ravine. He’d be thick 
with them now. 

Roan stopped to retch. He thought 
of removing the prickle bush from 
his foot, but it was too’ much to 
do anything else except crawl toward 
home. 

He came to the swinging bridge. 
Here the crawling was worse, in- 
finitely worse, because his hands 
slipped on the smooth, worn boards 
and it was possible that he’d slip 
off, between the ropes along the 
sides, and always the bridge swayed 
nauseatingly. 

The wood smelled dry and hot and 
burned his arms and hands and 
the prickle bush made an arid, in- 
sistent rustle, scraping along with 
the dead foot. 

He crawled forever through th^: 
hot, bright fog, his whe^e leg burn 
ing like a torch. He reach^ horn 
and crawled up on the stoop aii 
called, “Ma, Dad!” and went black 
again, still cedling through the in- 
finite dark corridors of his un- 
consciousness .... 

Ma was saying, “Drink this,” and 
he drank it. 

“Raff!” she called. ‘^He’s awake.” 

Dad was there, his big, broken 
body looming in the doorway. You 
knew he was big, but he stood 
shorter than Ma. 

“Stop that sniffling, Bella,” he 
said. “I’ll do it good.” 



EARTHBLOOD 



If 




Roan was gladder of Dad. Ma 
was so old. Like cuiied leaves. 
Like things the winds toss up. 

Raff sat down heavily, arranged 
himself on the chair, his bent legs 
awkwardly set back and his twisted 
torso facing to one side so that 
his face was over Roan’s, his good 
eye bright and blue. 

“It’s all right.” 

“I’m broken. Dad,” Roan said, 
and realized something suddenly. 
“Like you.” And began to cry. 

“Oooh!” Ma said, almost whis- 
tling it, “Oooh.” 

“Get out of the room, woman,” 
Dad said, looming over to pat 
Roan’s shoulder. “I’ll fix you, boy. 
Shut up, Bella. My hands are good. 
I don’t have anything else left, but 
I’ve got that.” 

Raff felt softly Roan’s foot. Roan 
screamed. 

“The drink’ll help some, boy,” 
Dad said. “But this is going to 
hurt. There’s no help for it. Let it 
hurt.” 

Roan was shaking all over and 
Ma was sobbing and saying, “Stop, 
Raff, stop, I can’t stand it.” And 
Dad was doing something to his 
foot and Roan shuddered and shud- 
dered and finally thought. I’m go- 
ing to die. Dad is killing me. Dad 
is killing me because I’m broken. 

T he first day that Roan was out- 
side exercising his foot the gracyl 
sevens came by. Roan was care- 
fully limping. 

“He’s aliveV^ one of them said, 
and they all stood still and gaped 
at him, and came close and then 
edged back a little. 



“Go ahead, walk'' Dad said to 
Roan. 

Roan limped painfully. 

“Put your weight on it. It doesn’t 
matter how much it hurts. Use it. 
Show ’em.” 

“He ain’t natural,” a gracyl child 
said. 

“He was dead,” another added. 

“His feathers ain’t natural, either. 
Look at ’em. They’re both dead 
people walking around alive, that’s 
what they are.” 

The children edged back some 
more, flapping their skinny arms ex- 
citedly,, showing the pink mem- 
branes of their developing wings. 

One of them picked a bright 
Chunckflower pod from the front 
garden. It missed Roan and made a 
garish stain on the little house Raff 
so carefully whitened every spring. 

Dad started after the gracyl and 
the child laughed and spread its 
wings and flew off in little jumps. 
Raff swore at his twisted bones 
and useless muscles and tried to 
catch the children, and, forgetting 
himself, fell and lay there futilely 
trying to twist himself over like a 
turtle. 

“Roan’s old man is broken!” they 
chanted. “Roan’s a freak, and he’s 
broken, too!” They howled with 
glee and tossed the chunk flower 
pods as fast as they could pick them, 
and when the pods began to run 
out they used gobs of mud. 

Bella came to the front door and 
screamed. 

Roan forgot his foot. He didn’t 
even know it hurt. He ran to the 
nearest gracyl and wrestled the pod 
from his hand and smeared the 



20 



IF 




juice in his eyes. Then he grabbed 
the next one and did the same 
thing. 

They were all upon him, but they 
didn’t fight together. They didn’t 
have one hold him while another 
hit; Roan fought them one at a time. 
He got one gracyl in a scissors grip 
with his legs and another around 
the neck with his hands and bit a 
third that landed on his face. 

Finally those who hadn’t gotten 
hurt bounded off, in their half- 
flights, and the rest lay there to 
see whether they were going to die 
or not. 

^"T^hat evening before dinner Roan 
A took off his tunic and looked at 
himself in the mirror, examining 
himself carefully all over. He felt 
his hair and poked at his teeth. 
He twisted around and examined 
his back minutely and then moved 
his arms and poked what he called 
his wing bones in and out, seeing 
the sharp edges move beneath the 
thin skin. 

He went to dinner, but he didn’t 
look at the food on the table; he 
looked at Ma and Dad. And he 
asked, “What am I?” He always 
asked, but he never understood. 

“You,” said Dad, “are a human 
being. And don’t you forget it.” 
That was what he always said. 

Roan looked at the steaming 
plate Ma put before him and didn’t 
want it. “Then that’s why I’m stoo- 
pid. Why I can’t do anything the 
gracyl s do.” 

Raff and Bella exchanged glances. 

“That’s why you can do every- 
thing the gracyls can*t do.” Raff 



said. “Or that anybody there is can’t 
do.” 

“You cost two thousand Galactic 
credits,” Bella said proudly. 

‘T cost that muchr 

“You were special,” Bella said. 
“Very special.” 

Roan thought of the insignificent 
white body he’d just examined, and 
how it got so easily hurt and broken 
and how he didnT have any wings 
and how he’d had to learn 
how to burrow and swim instead 
of just knowing as the gracyls did, 
and how he couldn’t just let himself 
die when he was broken but had 
to cause everybody a lot of trou- 
ble ... 

“You got gypped, didn’t you?” 
Roan said, and ran to his room 
to cry alone. 

But when he’d finished crying he 
was hungry and he came out and 
ate and Raff talked to him about 
what a great thing it was to be a 
human — and the original Terry 
strain. Roan kept trying to believe 
all the things Raff told him. 

Raff was enjoying this talk with 
his son, and thinking how more and 
more his son would be a compaion 
to him, and how it had been wdrth 
the trouble and the expense of 
adopting Roan and seeing him 
through the difficult years of baby- 
hood — and hadn’t the boy grown 
fast!” 

“You weren’t born to be a slave. 
The Shah could have those a dime 
a dozen, or for a common soldier, 
because those were easy to come 
by, too. You were something spe- 
cial.” 

“But when will my wings grow?”

Roan asked, watching Raff’s wide, 
brown face. 

Raff shook his head. “You don’t 
need wings, boy. You‘ve got some- 
thing better. You’ve got human- 
ness.” 

“Oh, don’t try to explain him 
all that, him only seven years 
old, even if he is big for his age.” 
Bella said, coming in with another 
hot dish. 

“He’s old enough to understand 
he’s a Terry. A real Terry, gen- 
uine Terrestrial strain,” Raff said. 
“Not mutated, like me.” He nodded 
proudly at the boy. “And not just 
humanoid, Iflte your ma.” He 
leaned toward Roan. Some day 
you’ll know what that means. Real 
Terry — the breed that settled the 
whole universe — that built the em- 
pire, long ago.” 

“I thought* they were all stuck 
on Terra,” Roan said. “That’s what 
T’hoy hoy says.” 

Raff looked confused. “Yes, but 
. you were a special case.” 

“And if I’m a real Terry, why 
do we have to live in the ghetto 
with a bunch of old gracyls, and — ” 

“Here, don’t go worrying your 
mind about all that,” Raff cut in. 
“You’re genuine, all right. I can 
tell. I’ve seen pictures. Look at 
you: pale skin, like skim-ice, and 
hair the color of wineberries, 
and ” 

“But how did I get here, and 
where are the other real Terries 
and — ” 

“Raff, I told you it wasn’t good 
for the boy to get talking about all 
those things.” 

“Some day when you’re older,” 



Raff said. “Now just eat your din- 
ner, and take my word for it. You 
can hold your head up any place 
in the Galaxy and be proud. You’re 
a Terry. Nobody can take that 
away from you.” 

T’hoy hoy had come in to put 
Roan to bed. “I didn’t mean to 
upset the boy.” he told Raff, “tell- 
ing him about the Terran blockade 
and all the old Terran legends.” 
‘Tell him the legends,” Raff said. 
“I want him to know. Tell him 
your stories, T’hoy hoy.” 

“Then Roan, tonight I tell you 
the song of Silver Shane the war- 
rior, who defeated a Niss dread- 
naught single-handed by crawling 
up through the waste ejector and 
holding a fusion bomb while it ex- 
ploded.” 

I t was winter. The incontinent 
rains of Tambool swept across 
the hills and found out a hole in 
the ceiling of the Cornay’s house 
and Roan heard it drip, drip and 
it was the last straw, to try to read 
with that drip, drip happening and 
the frowsy house smelling of age 
and poverty, the house they could 
have because nobody else wanted 
it. 

“It’s nasty outside,” Bella said. 
“It’s nastier inside,” Roan said, 
and flung his book across the room. 
“I’m through.” 

“You haven’t even started,” Raff 
said. “Sit back down.” 

Roan stood at bay before his par- 
ents. Bella set her bone-white lips 
and began picking irritably at the 
shedding skin on her thin arm. Raff 
tried to work up a temper over the

boy, but he couldn’t. He’s beauti- 
ful, Raff thought. No other word 
for it. Beautiful. Standing there tall 
for his ten years and glowing in his 
anger, with the dark red curls 
tumbling over his forehead. 

“Everything,” Roan sihouted, “I 
have to do everything the hard way. 
I’m tired of it. They don’t study, 
study, study. They know how to 
read just looking at the graffiti.” 
“They’re only gracyls.” Raff said. 
“Charons know how to build mud 
houses without learning. It’s the 
same thing.” 

“I want to do whatever it is 
humans know how to do without 
learning. A two thousand credit 
Man ought to be able to do some- 
thing:* 

Raff pounded his right fist into 
his left hand and wished he could 
flex the words the way he could 
flex his hands. “I’ve tried to make 
you understand. I don’t know how 
to say it so’s you’ll see. Humans 
are superior, but that doesn’t mean 
everything’s easy for you. But you 
can do things no gracyl can do — ” 
“One thing human’s don’t do is 
read,” Roan interrupted. “I hate 
reading. ” 

“But you can read good** Bella 
said. “You read better than me. Bet- 
ter than Raff. And you can read 
gracyl and Universal and those Ter- 
ran books we kept for you.” 

“I know he can read good,” Raff 
cut in. “I want him to read bet- 
ter. Good isn’t enough.” 

“Human’s aren*t superior,” Roan 
said. They’re — ” 

“That’s enough, boy,” Raff said 
sharply. He rocked in his chair. 



watching Roan sliding his foot 
in a puddle of rain water on the 
floor. Bella went to the crockery 
^elf and took down a bowl to put 
under the leak in the roof. “Sup- 
pose you can’t read for Studies? 
You’ll get sent away from home 
with the Junior Apprentices.” 

Raff frowned, watching her mop 
up the floor with the dish towel. 
“Of course he can read good 
enough for Studies. If only he don’t 
trip up on a word we havtjn’t come 
across in the gracyl graffiti yet. 
Even so, a gracyl that develops 
seventy per cent literacy goes for 
Studies. Roan’s reached that by 
now.” 

Bella straightened painfully from 
the floor and rubbed at her shed- 
ding skin with the dish towel. She 
looked at Roan and bit at her lip, 
an old gesture that had once even 
been cute. 

“He’s been working so hard, Raff. 
Maybe we ought to let up on him 
some.” 

Roan went to the door. 

“Here! Where are you going, 
son?” 

Roan looked defiantly at Raff. 
“J’m going to do what humans can 
do and gracyls can’t. And it isn’t 
reading and it’s not flying.” And 
he was out of the door into the 
rain. 

“Raff, stop him!” 

“Don’t worry. He’s human. He 
knows what to do even if he 
doesn’t know he knows.” 

They both sat by the strip of 
cloudy plastiflex window and 
watched the rain on the garbage 
dump, waiting. They didn’t reach

for each other any more. Only for 
the boy. 

T 'he ten yearers were hilarious 
with the game of swoop ball in 
the rain when Roan came over the 
hill in sight of them. It was a sim- 
ple game. The idea was to keep hold 
of the ball. They played in a grove 
of scattered trees, and whoever de- 
cided to take the ball would swoop 
down on whoever had it and take 
it away and then another would 
swoop down and take it from the 
second one, if possible in mid-air. 
And when you took the ball, you 
also knocked the gracyl out of the 
air, which was easy, and if possi- 
ble into the yard-deep ditch of 
muddy water that ran along the 
edge of the little grove. 

Roan leaped lightly across the 
muddy ditch. 

The gracyls were delighted to see 
him. The gracyl with the ball tossed 
it to him. Then four of them 
swooped straight at him and their 
momentum shoved his back, straight 
down into the mud of the ditch. 

“Okay,” Roan said, climbing out 
in the oozy mud. “Okay, I just 
wanted to be sure I was in the 
game.” 

One of the trees was a young 
Purplefruit tree, and Roan found a 
straight rope-vine and cut off a 
good length from it, several times 
longer than he was tall. He tied a 
slip knot in one end and then coiled 
the rope and slung it in his belt. 
At the edge of the grove by the 
ditch, he picked a quarter-grown 
sapling and climbed up its straight 
trunk, hanging by his hands when it 



began to bend, and edging along 
the lei^fii of the young, springy tree 
until the top of it bent down to the 
ground. Then carefidly, using hii 
full strength, he bent the tree all 
the way back on itself and used a 
length of the rope to tie the top 
to the lower part of the thin trunk. 
He still had plenty of rope left. - 
The gracyls gathered around and 
jeered. ‘That’s a silly game,” they 
said. “Who ever played that?” 

“It’s part of swoop ball,” Roan 
said. “You just watch.” 

“Yah, yah,” said the gracyl who 
had the ball at the moment. He 
was up in a nearby tree and he 
swooped to a lower branch. Then 
another gracyl swooped the ball 
away from him and Roan was 
twirling his rope as the last gracyl 
was flying across the grove with the 
ball. 

He caught the gracyl around the 
leg in a beautiful loop and drew 
him in squawking. 

Roan calmly took the ball away 
and threw it to another gracyl to 
start the game again, and trussed the 
lassoed gracyl to the sapling and 
slipped the rope, so the gracyl went 
sailing away over the ditch. 

Roan climbed up the sapling and 
bent it again. It no longer stood 
straight but there was plenty of 
spring left in it. He looped his 
lasso again and caught the next 
glacyl that came sailing by. 

“I seem to keep winning,” Roan 
said, trussing the next gracyl to the 
tree, and slipping the rope again. 
This one landed right in the ditch, 
and scrambled out and made for 
home.

The gracyls could have played 
swoop ball higher up in the trees, 
where Roan’s lasso couldn’t reach 
them. Or they could have moved 
the game. But they didn’t. This 
was where gracyls played swoop 
ball. 

Roan took care of two more 
gracyls. “Give up?’* he asked the 
rest. 

“Yah, you can’t even fly,” they 
said and kept on playing exactly 
the same way. No one tried to take 
his rope away. No one tried to 
keep him from bending the sap- 
ling. 

Pretty soon there were no more 
gracyls. The last one went sailing 
over the ditch and hopped off home, 
whining. 

All except Clanth, of course, with 
his one undeveloped wing. He’d 
learned to sit and watch games. 

“That was fun,” Clanth said. 

Roan tossed his rope into the 
muddy ditch and leapt across it and 
turned back to watch the deserted 
spot where the swoop ball game had 
been. He rubbed the mud off his 
hands down the sides of his trou- 
sers. 

“I won,” he said, and grinned, 
and went home to practice his read- 
ing. 

Ill 

R oan sat on the stoop of his 
house with a large book spread 
in his lap. It was entitled Heroes of 
Old Terra, and it was packed with 
shiny tri-D pictures of men and 
ships and great towering cities. It 
was a very old book. Some of the 



pages were missing, but the pictures 
were still bright. 

“Hey, c’mon,” someone said. 
Roan’s mind swam out from the 
book. Clanth, who was the nearest 
thing Roan had to a friend, stood 
waiting. 

“Where?” Roan asked. 

“Where!” Clanth flapped his one, 
useless wing. His black, leathery 
gracyl face was alight with excite- 
ment, the round amber eyes asparkle. 
“It’s the Spring pre-mating. Out in 
the grove.” 

Roan’s fair cheeks flushed, back 
to the root of his deep red hair. 
“Don’t be ridiculous,” he said. “But 
. good flying.” he added, so as 
not to offend his friend. It might 
have been an offensive phrase to 
Clanth, because of his disability, but 
Roan had found that Clanth pre- 
ferred for him not to be sensitive 
about it. 

“I . Oh, I’m not like the 
others, either. But Clanth was 
handsome, gracyl handsome, and 
well developed for fourteen, and 
you noticed that before you noticed 
about his wing. And since he was 
in Studies, not Labor, it didn’t make 
so much difference about the wing. 
“C’mon. Roan!” 

“What would I do there?” Roan 
asked. “Provided I could get a fe- 
male up a tree to begin with?” 

“Well . wings aren’t really 
necessary. At least I hope not. Look 
at me.” And he raised his wingless 
right arm. 

“I’d rather not try.” Roan pic- 
tured the black, screeching little 
gracyl females. He was glad he 
didn’t want one, because s'he’d 



26 



IF 




ktugh at him if he did. Sneer at 
him. Flap her wings at him. 

“But gee, here you are fourteen 
years old,” Clanth persisted. “What 
are you going to doT* 

“ril wait,” said Roan. 

“For what?” Clath asked, and 
didn’t wait for the answer, for a 
gaggle of fourteens went by and 
Clanth ran off to join them. 

Roan watched them go, then sat 
with the book in his lap, gazing at 
the clouds and trying to picture a 
human female. The portraits in his 
books, the descriptions he’d read; 
he tried to put all his knowledge 
together, but it wouldn’t add up 
to a definite picture. Every time 
lie thought he had it, it slipped 
away from him. 

Day wore into evening and still 
Roan sat, and he thought about 
human women and then about 
human men, and the old heroes of 
his book, who left human women 
to go out and find new worlds, and 
died showing there were places be- 
sides earth where human men could 
bring human women. 

Human women were not like Ma. 
They were . Roan couldn’t find 
the thought. He didn’t know. 

The gracyls had finished going 
by. The crowds of young males 
had gone out, and the crowds of 
ripening females. The first moon was 
still white in the sky, but it was 
brightening and soon the sickle anti- 
moon would come up and the cere- 
monies would begin. Roan wished 
Clanth well and hoped his female 
would not laugh too much at his 
poor wingless arm. 

Another group of youths was com- 



ing along; there was a low mutter 
of talk and laughter among them — 
and they were not gracyls. 

iiQupperl” Ma called. And came 
O to the door. "What are you 
doing reading in that ligjit?” 

Roan peered tlirough the gloom 
to see who was coming. The Vebd. 
What were they doing out of their 
ornately decorated quartets in the 
heart of the town? 

“Has there been a Veed murder 
or something?” Roan asked, be- 
cause Ma always managed to know, 
without talking to anybody, what 
was going on in the adult world. 

“If there has^ I don’t want to 
know about it and neither do you.” 
said Ma, retreating further behind 
the front door. “You come on in. 
You don’t want to tempt that trash 
to stop here.” 

But Roan waited to watch them 
go by, the young Veed, their scale- 
suits glittering faintly even in the 
tarnished twilight. They walked up- 
right, looking almost human, talk- 
ing their Veed talk. 

“They’re children,” Roan said, 
and went in finally. “About my 
age.” 

“About fifty years old,” Ma said, 
spooning stewed limpid seeds onto 
the grits on his plate. “That would 
be' about half mature, for them.” 
“One of them was an aristocrat. 
I saw the iridion quadrant on his 
cheek.” What magic lives they must 
lead. Roan thought, those Veed, with 
their painted porches and their gar- 
dens and their endless games of 
slots and colored beads, and their 
lives that stretched on forever.

‘'When will I die?” Roan asked, 
and Dad dropped his knife with a 
helping of purplefniit balanced on 
it. 

“What made you that?” 

“Nothing. I just wondered. I 
mean the Veed take forever to* grow 
up and gracyls die if they get brok- 
en badly, but what about me?” 

“You,” Dad said. “Well, Fve al- 
ways answered you straight. You*Il 
live a long time yet. Take me. Fm 
a hundred and eighty, and still got 
lots of years ahead. You’ll live long- 
er yet. You’re prime Terry stock, 
boy.” 

“Even if I don’t get broken or 
something? That’s all Fll live? I’ll 
just die?” 

“There’s a story,” Raff said, pick- 
ing up his knife and scraping the 
dirtied fruit off on the side of his 
wooden plate, “an old, old story 
that at the beginning of time the 
nine Gods called all the species of 
intelligent beings together and asked 
them which they preferred, a long 
life or a glorious one. Only Man 
chose the glorious life. And he’s 
always been proud of it.” 

There was another sibilance of 
Veed going by outside and Roan 
scurried to the dark front window 
and saw a second group, headed the 
same way, toward the gracyl mating 
grove, Ae grove of trees by the 
ditch, where ‘long ago Roan had 
used his lasso to win a game of 
swoop ball. The sapling was a tree 
with spread limbs now, and maybe 
Clanth would be waiting in it to 
drop down and catch his female. 

The moonlight shown yellowish- 
pink now, and the garbage dump 



outside the window was jeweled with 
it. It was Veed garbage, Roan 
thought, and for some reason this 
made him love the graces and hate 
the Veed. 

‘There’s going to be trouble to- 
night,” Roan said, and finished his 
dinner thoughtfully. 

Raff silently got down his big 
hammer and nailed a panel on a 
bar of wood across each plastiflex 
window. 

“No,” said Roan, when Raff 
started to nail the door bolt from 
the inside. He wiped the last of 
the grits off his knife and stuck it 
through his rope vine belt. He pulled 
his tunic up short, so that it draped 
over his belt and left his legs free 
for running. Raff looked at him. 

“Clanth’s out there,” Roan said. 
“I’ll be back after a while.” 

“Now, boy,” Raff started. But 
Roan was already gone, out into the 
moonlight and the warm Spring 
night. 

44TT(^hy did you tell him that 
▼ ▼ silly story?” Bella asked, 
sitting in the darkened house and 
miserable at the thought of the long, 
dark hours before Roan might come 
home. 

“Because,” Raff said, T think 
it’s true. ” 

IV 

H e knew something the Veed 
didn’t know. He knew every 
s'hack and rock and ditch and gar- 
bage pile in the slum. As he came 
out of the house he sensed another 
group approaching, and he ducked 



28 



IF 




into a tunnel through the heaped 
garbage. 

They were speaking Veed, their 
hushed, hissed tongue, so Roan 
could not tell all of what they were 
saying, though they passed so close 
he could have spit on them. But he 
did catch “gracyl” (“shryshl”) and 
“Moon” which was the same word in 
all their languages. 

If it were only the children out, 
that meant it was a lark, not a 
Hunt in retribution for some crime 
or suspected crime. “Ten half- 
breed for one Veed,” was their rule. 
Half-breeds included anybody that 
wasn’t Veed. 

But this. This was children play- 
ing, or practicing. 

Roan gave the Veed a good head 
start. 

He went through the back yard 
of the funny, old, voiceless couple 
that kept mud-swine, and around 
another garbage heap, and through 
a series of gullies and then crept 
up the knoll that overlooked the 
ditch and the grove of trees where 
the gracyl were sporting. 

In the grove, where the moon- 
light could pick them out through 
the trees, Roan could see the run- 
ning gracyl, and hear their high, 
shrill calls. THey had no thought for 
anything but each other. He even 
thought he could make out Clanth, 
flapping grotesquely in the tree 
that Roan had known as a sapling. 
And he thought he saw something 
else, very strange. It looked like a 
white figure, high in one of the 
trees, looking on very still. 

Around the grove, in the ditch, 
the Veed boys were gathered in 



full force, a ditch full of glittering 
Veed, swaying silently in unisonv 
They must be almost ready for 
attack. 

Roan leapt to the top of the 
knoll and filled his lungs. “Dan-* 
ger!” he screamed, and the gracyl 
began running about in the grove 
in confusion and making for the 
tree tops. 

The Veed attacked immediately 
and furiously. No one seemed to 
have noticed that the scream had 
not come from within the grove. 
Roan was through the ditch and at 
die grove in seconds. 

The Veed filled the grove now, 
furious, slashing about with their 
razor-sharp wrist talons. They had 
planned to attack the gracyls on 
the ground. With the gracyls in 
the branches of the branches of 
the dark trees, it was going to be 
harder, and less fun. 

Roap crept forward and into and 
up the side of the dry ditch. 

And got caught by a Veed as 
he started up the purple fruit tree 
on the edge of the grove. He’d 
thought it was a tree that brought 
him luck. 

The Veed’s raking hands curled 
around his thighs and he felt the 
blood spring out into a thin line of 
pain and he jerked the knife free 
of his belt and slashed the coarse 
Veed flesh and felt the hands re- 
coil instantly. 

In the brief moment this gave 
him, Roan was scrambling up, 
swinging on a rope vine to the next 
tree. Around him gracyls fluttered 
and squawked. The cry of the 
wounded Veed had brought his fel- 



EARTHBLOOD 



29 




lows to his side. There were in- 
dignant conferences and hisses ot 
outrage. No gracyl had ever dared 
sto use a weapon against a Veed. 

Roan listened, catching a word 
here and there. They were out with- 
out permission, because young Veed 
were always carefully protected. So 
they couldn’t complain to their eld- 
ers about the wounded Veed. This 
meant they had to take their ven- 
geance on the spot. 

But they couldn’t get up into the 
trees because their bodies were too 
awkward for climbing and they 
couldn’t throw things up into the 
trees without hitting each other. 

Several of the Veed went over 
to one of the slenderest of the 
trees, where three gracyls hung in 
the branches like clumps of moss, 
and began pushing ‘the trunk back 
and forth. The gracyls screeched, 
clinging tighter in their panic, and 
as the tree gained momentum, one 
of them fefl to the ground, too pan- 
icked to try to fly. 

The Veed were gleeful. It was like 
smashing the purplefruit off a tree. 

Several Veed grabbed the gracyl 
and Roan carefully didn’t wat<A 
what they did with him. 

“Fly to the next tree.” Roan 
called to the other two gracyls. 
"All you have to do is stay calm.” 

But they couldn’t. They could 
only screech; the way gracyls always 
did when they were frightened. They 
couldn’t change, even to save their 
Ives. 

Another gracyl fell. 

Other Veed were starting on other 
trees. 

“Make for the thickest trees,” 



Roan called. “They can’t shake the 
thickest ones.” 

But no gracyl moved. Roan 
burned with the frustration of it 
all, the helplessness of the gracyk 
and the blunt cruelty of the Ve^ 
Where was Clanth? Perhaps he was 
already safe in a broadtrunked 
tree. 

“Clanth!” he called, but there 
was no answer. Perhaps Clanth 
couldn’t hear him, or perhaps he 
was clinging to a tree,' squawking 
with terror, like the other . gracyls. 
But he had always been a little dif- 
ferent; surely he would save him- 
self. Then Roan remembered. Clanth 
couldn’t fly. 

Roan’s tree began to sway. 

H e looked around for a rope vine, 
to make it to the broader trees 
toward the center of the grove, 
but there was no rope vine. He 
cursed himself for not having cut 
one and looped it through his belt 
when he was in the first tree. But 
it was too late. 

Well, it would be easy enough for 
him to hang on. He stood on one 
branch and held on to the next, 
watching the gleeful Veed below, 
their teeth gleaming as they smiled 
their crocodile smiles, their crests 
swaying contentedly. 

Something dropped past Roan and 
fell into the waiting arms of a Veed. 
They gasped to see it and so did 
Roan. It was all white and for a 
moment Roan thought it must be 
a human child. 

That was the moment he leapt. 

He leapt for the back of the Veed 
holding the screaming white creature 



30 



IP 




and he drove his knife deep into 
the Veed’s right eye, through to 
the brain, and the Veed died be- 
neath him. 

Roan pulled the knife out and 
stood on the dead Veed, the white 
creature clinging to his neck, and 
stood to meet the slashing blows of 
the other Veed. 

But they backed away from him. 

They were in awe and fear of 
him, that he had wounded one Veed 
and killed another. They had seen 
many a gracyl die, and that was 
funny. But they had never seen a 
Veed die before; they hadn’t 
thought anybody could kill a Veed. 

They fled to take revenge on more 
gracyls. It was safer. 

Roan pulled the white creature 
from his neck and looked at it. 

She was a white gracyl. 

“I’m not dead,” she said won- 
deringly. Gracyl fear didn’t last 
long when the dangfer was over. ‘T 
knew I was going to be broken and 
I am prepared to die and . now 
I feel as though I must have died 
and here I am still alive.” 

“You’re a half-breed?” he asked. 
“Or a mutation?” 

“I’m an albino,” she said. “You 
saved my life, didn’t you? You did 
that on purpose.” 

Then they were silent a moment, 
looking at each other in the little 
moonlight. Caught in the brief bond 
of savior and saved, they tried to 
meet minds across the deeps and 
dimensions that separated their 
alienesses. 

“I belong to you now,” she said 
and clung to him, and he held her 
close and felt her whiteness and 



kissed her strange, cold mouth and 
it was all a part of the swaying 
darkness and the hissing Veed and 
the dying gracyl and the death that 
Roan had made. TTie dead Veed and 
the victory. 

Roan had lost the threads that 
bound him to himself and all that 
was left was the white gracyl wom- 
an under his hands in the sickle 
moonlight. 

Across the grove, the gracyls were 
screaming as they fell but Roan 
was not thinking of them dying, 
only of the distant music of their 
voices. 

“That one was Clanth,” she said 
dreamily. “I was going to be his 
female and now . ** 

“Clanth!” Roan cried, and came 
to himself. 

“Yes. Only Clanth. After all, I 
just took him because nobody else 
wanted me and now it doesn’t mat- 
ter.” 

“Doesn’t matter!” He yanked her 
savagely to her feet. “Show me 
which way the scream came from! 
Show me where Clanth is.” He had 
not been listening. He had been 
not caring. He had been as bad as 
a gracyl. Worse, because they 
couldn’t help it and he could. 

He saw the Veed beginning to 
leave the grove as they made their 
way through the trees. Either they 
had had all their fun or it was 
time for them to get back before 
their parents discovered they were 
gone. 

“There he is,” said the white 
gracyl female. “What do you want 
with him?” 

One last Veed, seeing Roan, gave 



EARTHBLOOD 



31 




Clanth a parting slash and moved 
sinuously off. Roan knelt by the 
dying gracyl. “Clanth, I couldn’t 
find you. I couldn’t help.” But he 
!hadn’t looked. 

“I’m broken,” Clanth said. “But 
^oan, I had a female.” 

“I brought her to you.” Roan 
said. He stood and put his knife 
at the white female’s back until 
she came over to Clanth. “You can 
die in her arms.” 

“That was silly,” she said when 
Clanth had died. 

The gracyl, those that were left, 
were coming down from the trees 
now and incredibly starting their 
mating ceremonies again. 

Roan walked away through the 
grove, and out into the white moon- 
light. He climbed to the top of the 
tallest garbage heap, and sat, look- 
ing down on the ghetto, not listen- 
ing to the happy gracyl sounds, 
thinking about what a human wom- 
an might be like. 

V 

H ere on the high ledge, the wind 
was sharp with sand particles, 
buffeting at him angrily like a 
gracyl when you held him upside 
down to show him that even if 
you don’t have wings, you weren’t 
something to throw chunckflowers 
at. Roan got to his feet, holding on 
tightly to the tiny fingerholds of 
the wind-worn carving, feeling with 
his toes for a firm grip. He was 
high enough now: over the tops of 
the purplefruit trees, he could see 
the glare panels strung out across 
the arena gate, spelling out:

Roan’s hand twitched, wanting 
to go to his credit coder to check 
once more; but he restrained it. He 
knew what it would show. The 
balance gauge would barely show. 
Even the five demi-chits he’d 
earned stacking bread-logs for the 
Store was gone, spent for dyewood 
billets for carving. He’d have to 
be satisfied with what he could see 
from here — not that that would 
be much. He could hear the noise- 
makers faintly, but the dusty 
grounds of the arena were mostly 
obscured by the trees and the high 
wall, crumbling along its top like 
all the Old Things, but still high 
enough to shield the marvels from 
his view. 

But on the other side, there, 
where the great white-boled Never- 
never tree grew .... 

It was outside the Ghetto, be- 
yond the Soetti quarters, where Dad 
had told him never to put a foot — 
but the tree spread wide, almost 
to the rubble-littered top of the 



32 



IP 




wall, where h dipped down in a 
sort of notch. 

He wouldn’t really be going into 
the Soetti Quarter — just passing 
through. 

Then minutes later, Roan perched 
in an arched opening, just above 
the lower gates. He was breathing 
a little fast from the quick climb 
down. He checked to be sure no 
heavy old gracyl mares were 
stretching their atrophied wings on 
nearby balconies. Then he jumped, 
caught at ancient green-scaled tiles, 
scrambled up to a position astride 
the steep gable of the first house. 
From the balconies below, he heard 
a clatter of food troughs, a few 
shouts, a lazy pad of feet, the slam 
of a door. The oldsters’ early-eve- 
ning siesta was under way, and 
everyone else was at the Extrava- 
ganzoo. 

He rose, ran lightly along the 
ridge tiles, jumped the gap to the 
next house. There were carved devils 
at ten-foot intervals here; he had 
to drop flat at each one, work his 
way under, then up again. At the 
end, he swung down under the 
eave, dropped to a shed below, then 
swarmed up the carved gable end 
of the next house. But then it was 
easy. A series of wind-god altars, 
like stepping stones, led to the end 
of the last house before the high, 
black-glazed Barrier. He jumped for 
a drain-ledge, worked his way along 
to a down-gutter, held on with his 
fingers and slid quickly to the yel- 
low dust of the path. Roan grinned 
to himself. All those years of play- 
ing with the gracyls had almost 
taught him how to fly. 



The burrow under the Barrier 
was almost choked with rubble and 
blown pricklebushes; it had been 
a long time since he and Yopp, a 
Fustyan eggling, had last exploded 
it. Maybe he was too big now; he 
grew so fast — like a Soetti, Raff 
had said once, grumbling at having 
to cobble new shoes so soon after 
the last ones. 

But it was all right. Once the last 
pricklebush was dragged clear. Roan 
went in head-first, pulling himself 
along with his hands until he came 
to the straight-up part. Then he 
stood, put his back against one wall 
and his feet against the other and 
walked up. 

The idodine-smeH of the Soetti 
was strong, even before he reached 
the top and pulled himself out into 
the hazy, late orange sunlight, fil- 
tered dark by the great, sagging, 
patched nets the Soetti used to 
hold in their kind of air. Roan 
lay flat, breathing close to the 
ground. When he had his lungs full 

— even though they burned a little, 
from the bad Soetti air — he jumped 
up, ran for the high fences barely 
visible in the gloom at the far side 
of the quarter. 

He was halfway there when a 
big Soetti — almost five feet high 

— in greaves, a flared helmet with 
black eye-shields, and a heavy cloak, 
popped out of a hut in his path, 
blocking his way, heavy pincers 
ready. Roan slid to a stop, watching 
the violet-freckled claws. They 
looked too massive for the short, 
spindly Soetti arms, but Roan knew 
they could cut through quarter- 
inch chromalloy plate. 






EARTHBLCX5D 




From burrows all around, bright 
Soetti eyes winked, ducking back 
as he looked their way. The war- 
rior advanced a step, snapping his 
claws like pistol shots, pow! pow! 
Roan stooped, picked up a four- 
foot stick of springy booloo wood. 
He waved it at the Soetti. It hissed, 
its arms twitching in instinctive 
response to the movement. 

It saw what Roan was trying to 
do, and backed quickly; but Roan 
moved in, flicked the stick almost 
under the Soetti’s faceted eyes. The 
pincers flashed, locked on the wand, 
as involimtarily as a wink; and Roan 
jerked the stick hard, throwing the 
warrior off balance. He dropped 
the stick and sprang past the crea- 
ture, sprinting for the board wall, 
laughing as he ran. 

T 'he Never-never tree was three 
yards thick at the base, rising 
like a column of buttressed white 
stone set with daggers of crystal- 
line lime. It wasn’t hard to climb, 
as long as he just held on with his 
knees and elbows and didn’t touch 
the spines. The branch that reached 
out to the wall wasn’t very big, 
but it would probably hold all right 
— even with the weight of a six- 
teen year old Man on it. 

Roan started up. The first fifty 
feet was simple enough, the spines 
were as big as Roan’s wrist, set 
well apart; he could even use them 
as footholds. 

He reached for a higher grip — 
and a spine broke under his foot. 
His hand snapped out to seize a 
razor-edged spine while his knees 
gripped the narrowing buttress be- 



tween them. Pain tore through his 
hand and snaked down his arm, red 
pain and blood. Roan hated the 
dumb way his hand had grabbed, 
Kke the Soetti’s claws, at whatever 
came near. The Soetti’s claws 
couldn’t learn but maybe Roan’s 
hand could, if it hurt enough. And 
it did hurt enough and now it 
was slippery as well. 

Pain was a taste of death in 
Roan’s mouth, like the time he’d 
broken his foot. But something else 
Roan could do was ‘ force himself 
to forget things. He ignored the 
hand and went on. 

The branch that stretched over 
die wall had patches of peeling 
bark adhering to it. Roan brushed 
them away before stepping out on 
it. He couldn’t take a chance on 
losing his footing; with his slippery 
hand, he might not be able to hold 
on if he fell. He wiped his hand 
again on his tunic, then clenched 
it to hold in the pain and the blood. 

The branch moved gently under- 
foot as he walked out on it, swaying 
to the gusty wind, and dipping now 
under his heavier weight. Raff was 
right; he did grow too fast. He was 
heavier than an old gracyl brood- 
master. The tip of the branch was 
level with the top of the wall now; 
and now it dipped lower, the shiny 
blue leaves at its tip clattering soft- 
ly against the weathered masonry, 
^t he was close now. The whine 
and thump of the noise-makers was 
loud above the chirp and bellow 
of the crowd beyond the walls, and 
he could see the blue-white discs 
of the polyarcs glaring on the dusty 
midway. 



34 



IF 




The last few yards were hard go- 
ing. The tiny spines were close to- 
gether here — and sharp enough to 
stab through his bos-hide shoes. If 
the slender bough sank much low- 
er under his weight, he wouldn’t 
be able to reach the wall. But he 
knew. He knew from the gracyl 
games how much weight a tree limb 
could hold. 

Balancing carefully, Roan started 
the branch swaying, down, up, in 
a slow sweep, down, heavily, then 
shuddering up ... 

On the third upward swing. Roan 
jumped, caught the edge of the 
wall, raked at loose rubble, then 
pulled himself up and lay flat on 
the dust-powdered surface, still hot 
from the day’s sun. 

He opened his hand and looked at 
it. The blood had formed a blackish 
cake with the dust. That was good; 
now maybe it would stop running 
all over things and spoiling his fun. 
He patted it in the dust some more, 
then crawled to the edge of the 
wall and looked over into the glare 
of the grounds. 

Qound struck him in the face like 
O a thrown chunkflower: the 

massed roar of voices, the shrill 
clangor of the noise-makers, the 
rustle of scaled and leathered bodies, 
the grating of feet — shod, horned, 
clawed, hooved. The cries of shills 
and hucksters .... 

It was dark now. Twenty feet 
below Roan, the heads of the crowd 
stretched in a heaving sea of motion, 
surging around the pooled light of 
the midways, alive with color and 
movement. There, a jeweled harness 



sparkled on tandem-hitched bull- 
devils; there a great horned body, 
chained by one leg, pranced in an 
intricate dance; and beyond, caged 
dire-beasts paced, double jaws gap- 
ing. 

Roan forgot to breath, watching 
as a procession of scarlet-robed 
creatures with golden hides stfode 
into view from a spotlighted arch, 
fanned out to form a circle, dropped 
the red cloaks, and rushed together, 
cresting up into a living p 30 -amid, 
then dropping back to split and 
come togeAer like a wave breaking 
against a wall, and then .... 

He had to get closer. 

He raised his head and looked 
along the broken wall, following its 
great arc to the far side where it 
loomed black against the luminous 
amber twilight. He could jump 
down easily enough, but not without 
landing on a bad-tempered gracyl 
or a wide-jawed Yill. 

He rose and moved off, stepping 
carefully among the rubble. It was 
almost full dark now. Ahead, he 
made out the heavy sagging line 
of an anchor cable, its end secured 
to a massive iron capstan set in 
the stone coping. He clambered up, 
followed the cable with his eye 
as it dipped, then rose up to meet 
a slender tower. 

This was almost too easy. The 
base of the tower was hidden in 
shadow behind a cluster of poly- 
arcs. No one would notice if he 
walked across and slipped down 
there .... 

He stepped out on the taut ca- 
ble. It was much easier than the 
branch had been; it was only as 



EARTHBLOOD

big as his finger, but it was steady. 
No one looked up from below. He 
was above the polyarcs, invisible 
against their glare. 

He walked out across the crowd, 
reached to tower, swung down. 

A hand like an iron clamp locked 
on his ankle. 

He looked down, A face like a 
worn-out shoe blinked up at him. 
Gill-flaps at either side of the wide 
head quivered. 

“Come down, come down,” a 
curious double voice said. “Caught 
you — ought — you good — ood,” 

Roan held on and pulled; it was 
like trying to uproot an anvil tree. 

“Let’s go,” he said, trying to make 
his voice sound as though it were 
used to being obeyed by beings 
with old-shoe faces and hands like 
ship-grapples. 

“You’re — re — going to see — 
ee the boss — oss.” The iron hand 
— which was bright green, Roan 
noticed, and had three fingers — 
tugged, just gently, and Roan felt 
his joints creak. He held on. 

“Want me — ant me to pull — 
ull your leg — eg off — off?” the 
hollow voice echoed. 

“All right,” Roan said. He low- 
ered himself carefully until his other 
foot was on a level with his captor’s 
head. Then he swung his free leg 
back and kicked the creature in the 
eye. 

The grip was gone from his ankle, 
and iie leaped clear, landed in dust, 
turned to duck away — 

And slammed against a wide, ar- 
mored body that gathered him in 
with arms like roots of the grizzly- 
wood trees. 



I t was dark inside the big tent, 
and hot, and there were odors. 
Roan stood straight, trying not 
to think about the way his hands 
were numb from the grip on his 
wrists. Beside him, the shoe-faced 
creature flapped its gills, blinking 
its swollen eye. “Ow — ow,” it said, 
over and over. “Ow — ow.” 

The being behind the big- scarred, 
black-brown desk blinked large 
brown eyes at him from points eight 
inches apart, in a head the size of 
a washtub, mounted on a body like 
a hundred gallon bag of water. Im- 
mense hands with too many fingers 
reached for a box, extracted a thick 
brown cigar, peeled it carefully, 
thrust it into a gaping mouth that 
opened unexpectedly just above the 
brown eyes. 

“Some kind of , Terry, aren’t 
you?” a bass voice said from some- 
where near the floor. 

Roan swallowed. “Terry stock,” 
he said, trying to sound as though 
he were proud of it. “Genuine ori- 
ginal Terrestrial strain,” he added. 

The big head waggled. “I saw 
you on the wire. Never saw a Terry 
walk a wire like that before.” The 
voice seemed to come from under 
the desk. Roan peered, caught a 
glimpse of coiled purplish tenta- 
cles. He looked up to catch a brown 
eye upon him; the other was rolled 
toward the gilled creature. 

“You shouldn’t have hurt Ithc,” 
the deep voice rumbled. “Be quiet, 
Ithc.” The wandering eye turned 
back to Roan. “Take off your 
tunic.” 



36 



IF 




“Why?” 

“I want to see what kind of wings 
you’ve got.” 

“I don’t have any wings,” Roan 
said, sounding as though he didn’t 
care. “Terries don’t have wings; 
not real original Terrestrial stock, 
anyway.” 

“Let’s see your hands.” 

“He’s holding them.” 

“Let him go, Ithc.” The brown 
eyes looked at Roan’s hands as he 
opened and closed them to get the 
blood going again. 

“The feet,” the basso voice said. 
Roan kicked off a shoe and put 
his foot on the desk. He wiggled 
his toes, then put his foot back on 
the floor.” 

“You walked the wire with those 
feel?” 

Roan didn’t answer. 

“What were you doing up there?” 

“I was getting in without a tick- 
et,” Roan said, “I almost made it, 
too.” 

’’You like my little show, hey?” 

“I haven’t seen it — yet.” 

“You know who I am, young 
Terry?” 

Roan shook his head. 

‘I'm Gom Bulj, Entrepreneur 
Second Class.” One of the broad 
hands waved the cigar. “I’m owner 
of the Extravaganzoo. Now — ” the 
heavy body hitched forward in the 
wide chair — “I’ll tell you some- 
thing, young Terry. I haven’t seen 
a iot of Terries before, but I’ve 
always been a sort of admirer of 
theirs. Like back in ancient times, 
the wars and all that. Real spec- 
tacles.” Gom Bulj thumped his desk. 
“This desk — it’s made of Terry 



wood — woolnoot, I think they call 
H. Over six diousand years old. 
Came out of an old Terry liner, 
a derelict on — ” He cut off. 

“Never mind that. Another story. 
What I’m getting at is, how would 
you like to join my group, young 
Terry? Become a part of the Great 
Vorplisch Extravaganzoo; Travel, 
see the worlds, exhibit ybur un- 
usual skills to appreciative audi- 
ences of discerning beings all over 
the Western Arm?” 

R oan couldn’t help k: he gasped. 

“Not much pay at first.” 
Gom Bulj said quickly. He paused 
one eye on Roan. “In fact, no pay 
— until you learn the business.” 
Roan took a deep breath. Then 
he shook his head. Gom Bulj was 
still looking at him expectantly. 

“No,” he said. “Not until I ask 
Dad.” Suddenly Roan was remem- 
bering Ma, waiting, with his din- 
ner ready now, and Raff. Raff 
would be worried, wondering where 
he was. 

“I’ve got to go now.” he said, 
and wondered why he had such a 
strange, sinking feeling. 

Gom Bulj drummed his tentacles 
under the desk. He sucked on a 
stony-looking tooth, eyeing Roan 
thoughtfully. 

“No ne^ to trouble old Dad, 
young Terry. You’re big enough to 
leave the burrows, no doubt. Prob- 
ably he’ll never miss you, new lit- 
ters coming along — ” 

“Terries don’t have litters. Only 
one. And Ma only had me.” 
“You’ll write,” Gom Bulj said. 

“First planetfall, you’ll write, tell

them what a mark you’re making. A 
featured sideshow attraction in the 
finest ’zoo in this part of the Gal- 
axy.” 

“I’ll have to ask Dad’s per- 
mission first,” Roan said firmly. 

Gom Bulj signaled with a finger. 
“You’ll surprise him; come back 
some day, dressed in spangles and 
glare-jewels — ” 

Ithc’s reaching hand grazed Roan’s 
arm. as he ducked, whirled, darted 
for the tent flap. 

Something small, with bright red 
eyes, sprang in front of him; he 
bowled it over, ran for the tower, 
darting between the customers mill- 
ing in the way between the bright 
colored tents under the polyarcs. He 
veered around a cage inside which 
a long-legged creature moaned, 
jumped stretched tent-ropes, sprinted 
the last few yards — 

A hulking, gilled figure — a 
twin to Ithc — bounded into his 
path. He spun aside, plunged un- 
der an open tent flap, ploughed 
through massed gracyls who hissed 
and struck out with knobbed wing 
bones. A vast gray creature with 
long white horns growing from its 
mouth teetered on a tiny stand. It 
trumpeted nervously and swung a 
blow with a heavy gray head-tenta- 
cle as Roan darted past; then Roan 
was under the edge of the tent, up 
and running for the wall. Behind 
him, an electric voice crackled, deep 
tones ^ that rattled in a strange 
tongue. 

He saw the gate rising up, light 
festooned, above the surging pack. 
To one side, another of the gilled 
creatures worked its way toward him. 



knocking the crowd aside with 
sweeps of its three-pronged hands. 
Roan threw himself at the mass be- 
fore him, forcing passage. Another 
few yards — 

“Roan!” an agonized voice 

roared. By the gate, Raff’s massive 
white-maned head loomed over the 
crowd. “This way, boy!” 

“Dad!” Roan lowered his head, 
threw himself against the slow- 
moving bodies in his way. The gill- 
thing was close now — and there 
was another — 

And then he was at the gate, 

and Raff’s hand was stretched out 
to him above the crutch. 

The gilled creature thrust itself 

before Roan, arms spread wide. 
Roan whirled and saw the other — 
and beyond, a third, coming fast. 
He feinted, dived between the two 
nearest. 

The steel grip caught his arm. 

He looked up into the old-shoe 
face, swung his doubled fist. 

Both hands were caught now. He 
kicked, but only brushed his toes 
against the horny shins. 

And then Raff was there, his 
brown face twisted, his mouth open. 
Over the mob road. Roan couldn’t 
hear what he was shouting. He saw 
Raff’s thick arms swing up. The 
crutch came down in a crashing 
arc on the gilled head, and for an 
instant the grip loosened, and Roan 
pulled a hand free. 

And then a gray-green figure 
loomed behind Raff, and a three- 
fingered hand struck, and now Raff’s 
face was twisted in a different way, 
and he was falling, going down, 
and the white head was flushed

IF 




suddeidy crimson, and he lay in the 
yellow dust on his face, and Roan 
felt his throat screaming — 

His hand was free, and he 
struck. 

He felt something yield, and 
ripped at it, feeling his jaws open, 
teeth hungry for the enemy. T^en 
both hands were free, and he 
smashed at the old-leather face, see- 
ing it reel back. And then the other 
was at him with three-taloned hands 
clutching. Roan seized two long 
fingers in his two hands and tore 
at them and felt them break and 
rip — 

And then he was falling, falling, 
and somewhere voices called, but 
they were far away, too far, and 
they faded, and were gone. 

And he was alone and very small 
in the dark. 

VII 

G om Bulj's diamond stickpin 
glittered like his eyes, and he 
smoked his cigar as though he had 
tasted and wearied of all other 
cigars in the Universe. 

“You’re a wild one, Terry,” he 
said, both eyes staring at Roan. 
“What was the idea of crippling up 
Ithc? You should see his hand. 
Terrible!” 

“I hope he’s ruined,” Roan said, 
not crying, not thinking about the 
ache that made the side of his 
head feel as big as Gom Bulj’s. “I 
wish I’d been able to kill him. I 
will kill him the first chance I get.” 
He had to stop talking then, 
remembering Dad, trying to help, 
then falling. 



“There was no need for drama- 
tics. No need at all. If you’d come 
along quietly, you’d have found life 
in the Extravaganzoo most re- 
warding — and I’d still have the 
use of Ithc. Did you know you 
nearly tore his finger off?” 

“He killed Dad,” Roan said. 

Now there were tears.^ His face 
tried to twist and he felt dried 
blood crack on his skin; but he 
stood as straight as the Ythcan’s 
grip on his arms would let him, and 
looked Gom Bulj in one eye, the 
other being busy now with some 
papers spread on the desk. 

“I know everything you’re going 
to say,” the entrepreneur said, “so 
don’t bother to say it. Just let me 
indicate to you that you are a very 
lucky Terry, Terry. If you weren’t 
a valuable Freak, I’d put you out 
the nearest lock for the trouble 
you’ve caused me. But I’m a busi- 
ness man. You’ll start in as a scraper- 
punk and double in greenface.” He 
jerked his huge head at the three- 
fingered guard. “Take him along 
to a cubicle on number two mena- 
gerie deck with the other Freaks. 
And see there’s a stout lock on the 
door.” 

Green arms like cargo cranes 
turned Roan and propelled him into 
the corridor. The vibration of the 
engines and the stink of ozone 
were more noticable here than in 
the deep-carpeted office of the ’zoo 
owner. For a moment Roan felt a 
surge of excitement, remembering 
that he was aboard a ship, in deep 
space. He wanted to ask where 
they were bound, how long the 
voyage would last, but he wouldn’t 



EARTHBLOOD 



39 




ask the Ythcan. He might be one 
of the one’s who’d helped to kill 
Raff. Roan couldn’t tell them apart. 
But there was one he would recog- 
nize. 

R oan sat in the limp hay that 
was his bed. The metal-walled 
cell smelled of animals and old air. 
He was sore all over but his mind 
was clear, and he listened to the 
sound that had awakened him with 
a feeling of suspense that was al- 
most pleasurable. 

Something was working at the 
latch to his door. 

He looked about for a weapon, 
but there was nothing. Nothing but 
four stark walls and the used hay. 
Not even clothes. They had taken 
his tunic away. He thought, I’ll 
have to fight with my hands and 
teeth, and he crouched, ready. 

But the door didn’t open. Instead, 
a metal panel swung back. Sud- 
denly Roan was looking through bars 
into ochre eyes in an oval face 
with skin as pale and smooth as a 
Tay-tay leaf, and a cloud of soft 
hair the color of early sunshine. 

She laughed, a sound like night 
rain, and Roan stared at the soft 
red mouth, the white teeth, the tip 
of a pink tongue. 

“You’re ...” Roan said, “you’re 
a human woman!” 

She laughed again, and he saw 
a delicate purple vein that throbbed 
faintly in her white throat. “No,” 
she said in a voice like the murmur 
of evening wind in the crystalline 
leaves of the Never-never tree. 
“I’m a mule.” 

Roan came close to the barred 



window. He looked at her: thej 
slender neck, the shapes of yielding 
roundness under the silver clothes, 
the tiny waist, the long, slim lines 
of her thighs. 

“I’ve seen pictures,” Roan said. 
His voice seemed to catch in his 
throat. “But I never, ever saw . .” 

“You still haven’t. But Pa said 
I could pass for Pure Strain in a 
bad light.” She put her hands on 
the bars. They were small and 
smooth. Roan put out a hand and 
touched her. 

“A mule’s a cross between two 
human strains that never should 
had got mixed up together in the 
first place.” she said carelessly. 
“Mules are sterile.” She looked at 
him: 

“You’ve cut your head. And 
you’ve been crying.” 

“Will you — ” Roan started, and 
swallowed. “Will you take your 
tunic off?” 

The girl looked at him, still smil- 
ing, and then the pale cheeks sud- 
denly were pink. She laughed, but 
it was a different laugh. 

“What did you say?” 

“Please — take off your tunic.” 

For a long moment the ochre eyes 
looked into Roan’s blue ones. Then 
she stepped back from the door, 
her soft hand slipping from under 
Roan’s for a moment. She did things 
to the silver garment and it fell 
away, and she stood for a moment 
poised and straight, and then she 
turned slowly, all the way around. 

Roan’s breath came hard through 
the turmoil in his chest. 

“I never dreamed anything could 
be so beautiful,” he said.

T ^hfi girl drew a quick breath, 
then bent, snatched up her gar- 
ment, and was gone. Roan pressed 
his face to the bars, caught a glimpse 
of her as she darted past a lumber- 
ing, bald humanoid who turned and 
stared after her, then came clumping 
up to the cell door. He looked 
angrily at Roan. 

“What the hell’s wrong with 
Stel?’’ he barked. He looked down, 
clattering keys. “All right, Terry, 
the vacation’s over. I’m Nugg. You 
work for me. I can use some help, 
the devil knows.” 

The door clanked open. Roan 
stepped out, measuring the alien’s 
seven foot height. The creature 
raised a fist like a stone club, 
“Don’t get ideas, runt. Just do 
your work and you’ll get along. 
You’ll need some shoes, I sup- 
pose. And a tunic. Around this 
place clothes are the only way to 
tell the Freaks from the animals,” 
“Who was she?” Roan said, 
“Where did she go?” 

Nugg glared at him. “Keep your 
mind off Stel. Stellaraire, to you. 
She dances. She’s got no time for 
Freaks and scrapers. I know about 
you; you’re a mean one. You watch 
your step, Terry, and tend to your 
scraping — and your greenface. 
Now comfe on.” 

Roan followed the hulking hum- 
anoid along the echoing corridor, 
noisy with the rumble of ventila- 
tors, the clamor of voices, the 
thump of feet, to a dingy room of 
shelves heaped with equipment. Nugg 
hauled a large duffel bag of used 
clothing from a locker and dumped 
it out onto the floor. 



Roan discarded a bra affair that 
might have fitted a midget Stella- 
raire, a 2dppered tube that seemed 
to be made of human skin, a hexa- 
gonal wired corset, and a gauze 
veil before he came up with a sim- 
ple buttoned tunic only a few sizes 
too large. But he found a marvelous 
belt made of flexible metal links 
that fitted itself perfectly to his 
waist. He also found a pair of 
heavy hide sandals. 

Nugg grunted. “Get down to C 
deck. One of the boys will tell you 
what to do. And stay out of trou- 
ble!” 

Roan rode down the lift, stepped 
out into a sour reek of stables, a 
vast, still room echoing with grunts, 
squeals and the shuffle and clatter 
of hooves and the pad of horny 
feet. Through bars he saw shaggy 
pelts of black and pink and tan, 
glistening hides, scaled, knobbed, 
smooth, the flash of light on horns, 
tusks, fangs, the curl of sinuous 
tails, the reach of taloned limbs, 
and tentacles that groped restlessly. 

“You — 00 son of a bitch — 
itch,” and echoing voice said. 

Roan turned. On the other side of 
a massive grill a seven-foot Ythcan 
glowered, one three-fingered green 
hand thrust through the bars, the 
thick fingers closing futilely an inch 
from Roan’s tunic. The other hand 
was a round knob of dirty band- 
ages. 

Roan stepped back and looked 
around for a weapon. Ithc raised 
his maimed hand and shook it. “It 
wa — as my skilled — illed hand — 
and. You — oo’ve ruined it for life 
— ife.”

“Good,” Roan said. “I’m going 
to ruin the other one too.” 

“You — oo wait there — ere,” 
Ithc said, moving along the grill. 
“I’m — mm coming to kill — ill 
you — oo.” 

There was a long-handled pitch- 
fork against the bulkhead with straw 
and dung matted in the tines. Roan 
clanged it against the steel wall and 
ran to meet Ithc. A wide gate at 
the end of the grilled wall stood 
open. The Ythcan halted just be- 
yond it and Roan stepped through, 
the pitchfork raised. 

Ithc made a sudden motion and 
the heavy, motor-driven grill slam- 
med against Roan, knocked him off 
his feet, pinning him in the open- 
ing. The Ythcan planted a horny, 
three-toed foot against Roan’s chest 
and with his good hand drew a knife 
from behind him. He clicked a 
catch. The blade guard dropped 
off the knife. What was left was 
a glistening razor that made Roan 
bite his teeth to look at. 

“I’ll - — 11 cut your wrist tendons 
first — irst,” Ithc said. He leaned 
close, just out of reach of Roan’s 
hands. His gill flaps rippled, flush- 
ed pink. “Then — en I’ll do your 
eyes — ss . .” He held his band- 
aged hand before him for balance, 
weaving the blade to and fro. 

R oan *was watching the dagger. 

Every time it moved, he had 
his hands ready to grab. With a 
sudden, unexpected motion the 
Ythcan jabbed for his shoulder. 

Roan struck out — and the Ythcan 
jumped back, holding his bandaged 
hand. A red stain grew on it. Roan’s 



hand tingled from the blow he had 
struck. 

“Ow — ow,” Ithc keened. “Ow 
— ow.” He stepped back, holding 
the dagger by the point now and 
lining it up with Roan’s left eye. 
Roan got ready to dodge, then 
realized that was what he was sup- 
posed to do. The Ythcan would 
throw for some other spot. 

There was the clank of a door, 
then the sound of running feet along 
the corridor. 

Stellaraire’s woman-voice rang. 
“Ithc, you smelly animal! Get away 
from that gate. Let him up!” She 
was standing over Roan, long, thin 
legs planted astride him, fists on 
rounded hips. Ithc held up his 
blodd-stained bandage. 

“Because of him — im I lost — ost 
my job — ob. Now I’m just a dirty 
scraper — aper.” 

“You’ll be worse than that if I 
tell Gom Bulj about this!” She 
pushed at the heavy gate. 

“He hurt me — ee.” Ithc said. 
“Ow — ow.” But he let the gate 
come open. Roan rolled over and 
sat up. He looked at the pitchfork, 
and the girl followed his look. 

“Terry, you’ve got to promise 
me you won’t start it again.” 

“I’m going to kill him.” It was 
hard for Roan to breathe. His ribs 
hurt. 

“He would have killed you if I 
hadn’t made him let you up. Now 
call it square!” 

Roan looked at her. “Maybe he 
would and maybe he wouldn’t. He 
doesn’t move very fast.” 

“Look, you’ve got to forget what 
happened. He’s too dumb to hate.”

“Hey — ey,” Ithc started. 

“You shut up,” Stellaraire snap- 
ped. “Now go on, get out!” 

Roan watched Ithc move off hold- 
ing his bad hand in his good one. 
“All right,” he said. “I’ll leave him 
alone — until the first time he both- 
ers me.” He^ lay back against the 
cold metal floor, wanting to moan, 
but not wanting the girl to see how 
much pain hurt him. 

“I have to get to work.” 
Stellaraire’s hand was cool on his 
forehead. “You take it easy a 
minute, honey.” 

“By the nine Gods, you’re a real 
sucker for punishment. You stay 
where you are, till you get your 
breath.” 

“He’s still walking. So can I.” 
“You don’t have to tell me, 
sugar. You’re a tough one. I saw 
the fight when they caught you. The 
Ythcans don’t have much brains, 
but they’re awfully strong. I saw 
Ithc’s hand before they bandaged 
it. It’s ruined for life. I’ve never seen 
anybody fight like that before, and 
believe me. I’ve seen a lot of fights 
in my carny days. What made you 
so mad?” 

Roan sat up, remembering, feel- 
ing the hot tears ready behind his 
eyes. “My father,” he said. “They 
killed my old man.” 

“Ah, sweety, that was a lousy 
thing to do.” She was kneeling, 
cradling his. head in her arms. “Go 
ahead; it feels better if you cry. 
But you fixed that Ithc good. He 
can’t be on Security any more; not 
with that hand. Gom Bulj has al- 
ready sent him down here as a 
scraper.” 



“He didn’t have to kill Da<t” 
Roan said. “My father was a crip- 
ple. He was crippled defending me 
before I was born.” 

“How much real Terry strain do 
you have?” Stellaraire asked. “Your 
mother?” 

“I’m all Terry.” Roan said. “Raff 
was only my foster father. Ma 
wasn’t really human. They lived all 
their lives in a garbage dump on 
account of me and Dad got killed 
on account of me. And Ithc walks 
around with nothing . but a bad 
hand.” 

“My folks were a funny pair,” 
Stellaraire said. “Pa was a water 
miner on Archo Four. He came of 
one of the Ganny crosses. Real 
short, like, and he could go fifteen 
minutes without taking a breath — 
and o’ course real course skin. 
Mother came from Tyree’s World. 
She was dark, with light hair, and 
real slender. I’ve got her eyes, 
but outside of that. I’m a kind of 
a throwback, I guess.” 

“You’re beautiful,” Roan said. 
“I love your eyes. If ... if it 
wasn’t for Dad, I’d be glad they 
kidnapped me.” 

“That’s right.” Stellaraire smiled. 
“Just think about the good part.” 
“I’ve never had a friend before,” 
Roan said. “A real friend.” 

4 4/^ee,” said the girl, and her 
V-Teyes grew round like a 
child’s. “Gee, I could make you 
a list ten miles long of all the 
things men have called me since 
I’ve been with the ’zoo, but this is 
the first time it was ‘friend.’ ” Her 
hands moved gently over his chest

and arms. “There are the oddest 
things about you. This fuzz; what’s 
it for?” She touched his cheek. 
“And your face is prickly.” 

‘That’s my beard. I have to shave 
nearly every day.” 

“I like it. It gives me nice shiv- 
ers to get scraped with it. But I won- 
der what kind of adaptation it was 
supposed to be for. Open your 
mouth.” The girl looked at Roan’s 
teeth. 

“You have such nice, white teeth 
— but so many of them.” She 
counted. “Gosh, thirty-two.” She 
looked thoughtful, moving her 
tongue inside her mouth. “I only 
have twenty-six.” 

“The better to eat you with, my 
dear — ” 

The grilled door slammed open. 
A thick, boneless gray arm with 
a mouth at the end of it reached 
in, groped over Stellaraire, then 
curled around her and pulled her 
to the door. 

“Stellaraire!” Roan gasped, and 
jumped to his feet, grappling the 
arm. 

But Stellaraire was laughing, 
perched in the curve of the massive 
tentacle. Beyond the doorway, Roan 
saw a vast creature like a mountain 
of gray rock. The girl put a foot 
on a great curved tusk, stepped up 
to the enormous head. 

“It’s just Jumbo. He knows how 
to work the lift and sometimes he 
gets loose.” Jumbo reached his 
mouthed arm into a bin and came 
out with a wad of hay which he 
stuffed into the other mouth, un- 
der his single tentacle. 

“Stel!” a rasping voice called. 



“Get that damned bull back down 
where he belongs.” The bald hum- 
anoid, Nugg, came stamping up. He 
looked angrily at Roan. 

“Stel, this Terry’s dangerous. You 
stay away from him.” 

“You’re not talking to your 
scraping crew now, NuggJ’ Stellar- 
aire said sharply. “Don’t go giving 
me orders. And yqu’d better keep 
an eye on Ithc. He started trouble 
with the kid here.” 

Nugg looked angrily at Roan. 
“All right, you. Get to work. I 
told you — ” 

“He’s not working today. He 
might have busted ribs; that damned 
Ythcan goon slammed the door on 
him. I’m taking him to the vet right 
now.” 

“Look here, Stel — ” 

“Tell it to Gom Bulj. Come on, 
Terry.” \ 

Roan looked up at the elephant, 
then up at Stellaraire. He put out 
a hand and touched the gray hide, 
then stepped into the curve of the 
trunk and was lifted up beside the 
girl. 

“This is the strangest-looking 
creature I ever saw,” he said, trying 
to sound casual. “And you don’t 
have to call me Terry. My name’s 
Roan.” 

He held on as the bull turned 
ponderously, swayed off along the 
corridor. 

“And I don’t need to go to any 
vet.” he added. “I’m all right.” 

“Suits me. I’ll take you to my 
room and clean you up. You smell 
like a scraper already. And I want 
to take a better look at that cut on 
your face.”

R oan’s eyes opened wide when 
he saw Stellaraire’s quarters. 
The single room, three yards by 
four, had a low ceiling which shed 
a soft light on three walls decorated 
with patterns of flowers, and a 
foiHth which was a panel of green- 
ish grass behind which S'mall vivid 
fish waved feathery fronds, moving 
with dreamlike slowness through an 
eerie miniature landscape. There 
was a low couch by one wall, a 
table of polished black wood, a 
carpet of soft gray into which 
Roan’s feet seemed to sink ankle 
deep. 

He drew a breath, wrinkling his 
nose “It smells — pretty,” he said. 
“I never smelled a pretty smell be- 
fore.” 

“It’s just perfume, silly. Sit down 
— over there on the bed. I’ll get 
some medicine.” 

Roan waited quietly while the 
girl cleaned the deep scratch on 
his cheek, painted it with a purple 
fluid that burned like cold fire and 
sprayed a bandage in place. 

“There. I’m as good a vet as 
Grail any day. I ought to be. I’ve 
done enough of it. Now go in 
there — ” she pointed — “and take 
a bath.” 

Roan wen^t to the door and 
looked in. There was a large basin 
in the floor, with glittering knobs 
and spouts around it 
“I don’t see any water.” 
Stellaraire laughed. “You’re such 
a baby — except when you’re mad. 
Here, just turn this.” Water churned 
into the tub. 



“Now take off your tunic and 
get in. You do know how to scrub 
yourself, I hope.” 

Roan stepped into the warm 
water. “This is strange,” he said. 
“Taking a bath inside a room. I ti- 
ways used to go to the river ” 

“You mean right outside — with 
fish and things bumping into you? 
And mud? How could you ever do 
it?” 

“It was nice. And fish don’t 
bump into you. I could* swim right 
out across the water to the other 
side, and lie on the bank and look 
up at the sky. But this is nice, 
too,” he added. 

“Here, I’ll do your back. That 
Nugg, putting you in that dirty pen 
where they used to keep the mud- 
pig until he died! I’m going to tell 
Gom Bulj a thing or two. You’ll 
have a room right by mine. You’re 
a valuable Freak, Roan. What’s 
your act?” 

“Walking a wire. Gom Bulj said 
Terries aren’t supposed to be able 
to, but I don’t have any trouble ” 

S tellaraire shuddered. “I’m afraid 
of heights. But you said you 
grew up among those flying things 
— Grapples or whatever they are. 
What’s he paying you?” 

“I don’t know. Nothing, I guess, 
until I learn the business.” 

“Ha! We’ll see about that. Why, 
you’re the only real Terry in the 
show. Don’t say anything to Gom 
Bulj about the extra teeth and 
he’ll never know the difference.” 

“I don’t want anything from him. 
I’m going to get away as soon as 
I can, and go . go .

IF 




“Yeah, sweety, go where? You’d 
have to earn passage money back 
to Tambool — and believe me, it 
costs plenty. You’d better stick with 
the show at least until you’ve saved 
some money — and I’ll see that 
you’re paid what you’re wor^h.” 

“I don’t want you to get in 
trouble.** 

“Don’t worry about Gom Bulj. 
He’s really a kind of nice old cuss, 
after you get used to that tough 
talk. He’s so used to these tough 
Geeks he thinks he has to talk 
that way to everybody. But he 
doesn’t try it with me.” 

Roan dried on a huge soft towel 
that smelled as sweet as the room, 
and dressed in a clean tunic that 
Stellaraire took from a locker filled 
with bright clothes. 

“Come on,” she said. “I’ll show 
you around the ship. It used to 
be a Terran ship, you know It’s 
over five thousand years old.” 

For an hour Roan followed the 
girl along endless corridors filled 
with hurrying creatures, sounds, 
colors, odors, through vast, echoing 
halls which Stellaraire said had 
once been ballrooms and dining 
areas, up wide staircases and down 
narrow companionways, to a broad, 
curved room with a wall of ink- 
black glass set close with brilliant 
points of colored light. 

“You mean . that’s the sky?” 
Roan said, and watched the fantastic 
array of slowly proceeding lights, 
realizing for the first time what it 
meant to be in space. So much 
nothingness there! He looked around 
the rest of the room. A vast array 
of instruments and dials and a door 



with a red glare that said BATTLE 
CONTROL — AUTHORIZED 
PERSONNEL ONLY. 

“What’s all that?” he asked. “And 
who does the controlling in that 
room?” 

“All that’s not anybody’s business. 
Nobody goes in that room and no- 
body knows what all that’a for. It’s 
separate from the guidance system. 
This was originally . a Terran war- 
ship and all that’s for fighting. Gom 
Bulj says it works automatically if 
we run into another warship. But 
that isn’t likely. The thing to re- 
member is not to touch any buttons 
or switches and not to go into that 
little room.” 

Roan went over to look at the 
instrumentation closely. His people 
had built this ship and old heroes 
had flown it, fought in it. 

“I’ve got something a lot more 
interesting than that to show you,” 
Stellaraire said. “Come on. I want 
to show you Iron Robert.” 

“Who’s Iron Robert?” 

Stellaraire laughed and shuddered 
at the same time. “Wait and see.” 

T hey rode a lift, passed along a 
hall which vibrated with the 
thunder of the idling main drive, 
went through a high-domed room 
where several dozen ill-assorted be- 
ings sat in a group, puffing and 
thumping strange implements. Roan 
winced at the din of squealing flutes, 
blatting horns, clacking tambourines, 
whining strings. 

“What’s all this noise for?” he 
called over the cacophony. 

“Oh, a band is traditional with 
a ’zoo. It goes back to Empire 



EARTH BLOOD 



4f 




days. The old Terrans used to al- 
ways have noise-makers with social 
events. Some of our instruments 
even date from then.” 

“It’s terrible!” Roan watched a 
short, many-armed being in yellow 
silks puffing away at a great bass 
horn. 

“Gom Bulj says the Terry noise- 
makers used some kind of charts, 
so they all made the same noises 
together, but our fellows don’t know 
how to read the charts. They just 
make any old noise.” 

“Let’s get out of here!” 

Nine decks below, in an armor- 
plated hold where heavy cargo had 
once been stored, Stellaraire took 
Roan’s arm, nodded toward a wide 
aisle which led back into gloom. 

“It’s along here,” she said. “He 
has the whole last bay.” 

“Why are you whispering?” Roan 
was looking around at the battered 
bulkheads. “I didn’t know anything 
could make dents in Terry metal. 
What happened?” 

“This is where Iron Robert exer- 
cises for his fights. And who’s whis- 
pering? Come on.” She led the way 
along the unlit passage, stopped 
before an open bay which was a 
cave of deeper gloom. 

“He’s in here,” she whispered. 
She was still holding Roan’s arm, 
tighter than before. He went closer, 
wrinkling his nose at a faint odor 
of sulphur, peering into the dark- 
ness. He could see dim walls, an 
object like an oversized anvil in the 
center of the floor, and near one 
wall an immense lumpy shape that 
loomed up like an incomplete stat- 
ue in gray stone. 



“He’s not here,” Roan said. 
“There’s nothing here but an old 
boulder.” 

“Shhh — ” Stellaraire started. 

The boulder moved in the sha- 
dows. It leaned forward, and Roan 
saw two bright-faceted jewels near 
the top, that caught the light and 
threw back a green glint. There was 
a low rumble that seemed to come 
from the bottom of a volcano. 

“Why you wake Iron Robert up?” 

“Hello, Iron Robert,” Stellaraire 
said in a squeaky voite. “I ... I 
wanted our new Freak to ... to 
meet you . He’s a Terry, sort 
of, and he’s going to do a wire- 
walking act and double in green- 
face ...” 

Her voice trailed off. Her fingers 
were digging into Roan’s arm now. 
He wanted to take a step back, 
but she was half behind him, and 
he would have to push her out of 
the way, so he stood his ground 
and looked into the green eyes, like 
chips of jade in an ancient idol. 

“You mean new Freak want to 
look at old Freak. Go ’head, Terry, 
take good look. Iron Robert strong- 
est living creature. Fight any be- 
ing, any time, any place.” The 
giant’s voice was a roll of chained 
thunder. 

Stellaraire tugged at Roan’s arm. 

“We . uh . didn’t mean to 
bother you, Iron Robert,” she said 
breathlessly. She tugged again, hard- 
er. But Roan didn’t move. 

“Don’t you have any lights in 
this place?” 

The dark shape stirred, rose up 
in the shadows, nine feet tall, mas- 
sive as a mountain.

“Iron Robert like dark. Sit in 
dark and think of old battles, old 
days.” He took a step and the 
deck boomed and trembled under 
Roan’s feet. “You come meet Iron 
Robert? Okay, you shake hand that 
can tear leg off bull-devil!” He 
thrust out a vast, blunt-fingered, 
grayish-brown paw. Roan looked at 
it. 

“What’s matter, Terry, you ’fraid 
Iron Robeert tear arm off you?” 

Roan reached out, put his hand 
in the stone one before him. It 
was rough and hard and warm, like 
rock in the sun, and it made him 
feel as soft and weak as a jelly- 
toad. Iron Robert flexed his fingers, 
and Roan felt the grating slide of 
the interlocking crystals of the in- 
credible hide. 

“You small, pale being,” Iron 
Robert rumbled. “You really Ter- 
ran?” 

Roan tried to stand up straighter, 
remembering that once Terrans had 
ruled the Galaxy. 

“That’s right,” he said. He looked 
up at the rough-hewn face above 
him and swallowed. “Why do they 
call you Iron Robert instead of Rock 
Robert?” He hoped his voice 
sounded bold. ^ 

“You look as though you’d last 
forever'” Roan said. He was think- 
ing suddenly of mountains, and 
how they weathered and endured, 
and of his own soft, inadequate flesh 
and the maybe two hundred years 
he had left. 

“Why not?” the giant said, and 
he took his hand away and turned 
and went back to the cast-iron slab 
that was his bed. Roan’s eyes were 



accommodating to the dim light 
now, and he saw a small plaque 
over the bunk, a carved design of 
growing flowers. One of the blos- 
soms, half-blown, leaned, dropped 
a petal that fell with a gritty crunch, 
crumbling into dust. 

“Petals all gone soon,” Iron Ro- 
bert said .“Then last remembrance 
of home gone. Flower getting old, 
Iron Robert old, tpo, Terry. Last 
long time, maybe, but not forever.” 
“Well, ’bye Iron Robert,” Stellar- 
aire said, and this time when she 
tugged at Roan’s arm, he went with 
her. 

T hat night Stellaraire made Roan 
a pallet in a small room near 
her own. She dressed the scratch on 
his face again, and the other, deep- 
er one on his thigh, adjusted the 
blanket under’ his chin, did some- 
thing nice to his mouth with hers, 
then went away and left him alone 
in the silence and the dark. For 
a while he thought of the strange- 
ness of it, and suddenly the lone- 
liness was almost choking him, like 
the bad air in the Soetti Quarter. 
Then he thought of Stellaraire, and 
of suddenly having a friend, some- 
thing he had almost forgotten since 
Clanth had died so long ago. 

Then he slept, and his sleep was 
tortured with vivid, dying images of 
Dad. Of Dad’s sad corpse, crying 
for blood. 

IX 

R oan awoke with a foot digging 
into his side. 

“So here you are,” Nugg growled 



EARTHBLOOD

down at him. “Let me tell you I 
got better things to do than look 
all over the ship for you, Terry! 
Here!” He dropped a box on the 
floor by Roan. 

“Chow’s been over for an hour. 
What do you think this is?” 

Roan sat up, rubbed his eyes, 
feeling the cold, early-morning feel- 
ing, even here in a ship in space, 
far from any sun, with a tempera- 
ture controlled by machines so that 
it never varied, year in and year 
out. 

He picked up the box Nugg had 
tossed to him, got the lid off. In- 
side were two lumpy-shelled eggs, 
a slab of coarse, gray bread, a 
fruit diat looked like a small pur- 
plefruit; there ^was also a lump 
of raw, greenish meat and a red, 
coagulated pudding that almost 
turned his stomach in spite of the 
sudden hollow hunger feeling. 

“Thanks, Nugg — ” Roan started. 
But Nugg cut him off with a con- 
temptuous snort. 

“If you don’t eat you’ll be loo 
weak to work. Hurry it up.” While 
Roan ate, Nugg went on grumbling 
about dangerous freaks, malinger- 
ers, and interference with discipline 
by privileged characters. Roan fin- 
ished, then pulled on his tunic, feel- 
ing the pain as he stretched his 
wounded flank. It hurt more than 
a deeper wound might have, and it 
reminded him of Ithc. The feeling 
of hatred warmed him. It made his 
heart thump and his body ache. He 
hated Ithc worse than he loved Stel- 
laraire. 

Love, he thought loudly. That’s 
what love is. 



He stood, doing up buttons and 
thinking of the slender Mule, and 
how it felt to love a girl who wag 
human, or almost human. 

“I’m taking you off scraping. 
You’ll work in Stores. It’s only a 
short hop to Chlora, and there’s in- 
ventory to take.” 

Roan buckled on his belt. It 
made him feel strong, the hard 
embrace of the belt, and he won- 
dered if this were why there were 
so man^y stories of magic belts, like 
the ones Uncle T’hoy hoy used to 
tell him. 

“If I have to work all the time,” 
he asked as he followed Nugg out 
into the corridor, “when do I prac- 
tice my wire-walking act?” 
“Practice? What’s that?” 

“I need to get ready for the 
show. Gom Bulj said — ” 

“You’re supposed to be a Terry 
who can walk a wire like a vine- 
rat; that’s why Gom Bulj took you 
on. You either can or you can’t. 
Practice! Hah!” 

Roan followed Nugg through the 
din of the Freak Quarter, past the 
bumps, hisses, shouts, the dragging 
of boxes and the commotion of peo- 
ple doing things in a hurry. He 
stared at furred and scaled and 
feathered faces, massive bodies that 
clumped on short legs, and lean 
ones that jittered on limbs with too 
many joints, tiny things that scut- 
tled, and here and there the bald, 
clumsy-look shape of a Minid or 
a Chronid, or some other creature 
with same faint claim to a trace 
of natural Terran or humanoid 
blood. 

He looked around for Stellaraire 



50 



IF 




but there were only strangers every- 
where, all hurrying and shouting 
to each other, their faces hot and 
busy looking. He passed Gom Bidj 
at the center of a crowd, snapping 
out orders and smoking two cigars 
at once. The entrepreneur saw him, 
waved a nine-fingered hand and 
called out something Roan couldn’t 
hear. 

They went down, down, into 
smellier and less crowded levels. 
In a vast, noisy storeroom, Nugg 
pointed out a skinny, scruffy be- 
ing like an oversized and wingless 
gracyl. 

“He’s foreman of the shift. Do 
what he tells you. And stay out 
of trouble.” He walked off and 
left Roan standing alone. 

The foreman had been watching 
from the corner of a moist eye. 
He stalked over to Roan, looked 
at him, then gave a shrill cry. The 
workers who had been crawling 
over the heaped goods stopped what 
they were doing and gathered 
around. Others appeared from aisles. 
Altogether there were fifteen or 
twenty of them, no two alike. They 
all stared at Roan. 

“What are you?” the foreman 
whistled. “Never saw one like you 
before.”, 

“I’m a Terran,” Roan said. 

Somebody hissed. 

T he foreman clacked his shoulder 
blades together and ruffled out 
a fringe along the sides of his 
neck. “I’m a Rik-rik and I’m the 
boss here,” he whistled. “Now, 
you’re new. Your job will be to 
carry out the slop jars. And some 



of the boys don’t have sphincters; 
you’ll take care of the diapers. And 
o’ course, some of the gang are 
messy eaters, regurg^s, you know. 
Tha/ has to be cleaned And — ** 

“No,” Roan said. 

The circle around hkn nK>ved m 
closer. Something plucked at Roan^ 
tunic from behind. 

“I’m boss here, Terry,” Rik-^ik 
shrilled. “You’ll do what I tell you, 
right, fellas?” 

The tug came again, and Roan 
whirled, grabbed at a snaky ten- 
tacle that was wiping something 
slimy on him. The being who owned 
the member yanked angrily, but 
Roan hauled it close, then suddenly 
shoved it back. It fell. The others 
made excited noises. Roan faced 
Rik-rik. 

“I didn’t ask to be here,” he 
said, “but I’m here anyway. I’ll 
work, but I won’t carry slop. Your 
men can clean up their own mess- 
es.” 

“You’re the newest one,” Rik-rik 
squeaked. “You’re supposed to car- 
ry the slop! The newest one always 
does.” 

“Not me,” Roan said. “Leave me 
alone and I’ll work as hard as any- 
body. But don’t you think you can 
pick on me.” He looked at the 
being who was shifting from one 
of its eight or nine feet to an- 
other and snorting softly through 
its trunk-like tentacle. “And if you 
ever touch me again. I’ll tie a 
knot in that arm of yours.” 

“Spoilsport,” someone grumbled. 

Rik-rik stared at Roan angrily. 
“You’re a trouble-maker, I can 
see that. Probably you’ll want off 



EARTHBLCXDD 



51 




three or four hours in a cycle to 
hibernate; most of you would-be 
Terries do.” 

“I sleep eight hours a day,” Roan 
said, “in a bed.” 

“And you’ll want food every day, 
too. — ” 

“Three times a day.” 

“Maybe it’d like to join our sex 
circle.” a bulbous being suggested. 
“We have a vacancy in — ” 

“No, thanks,” Roan said. “We 
Terries prefer our own kind for 
that.” 

“Chauvinist,” a gluey voice said. 

“Hah,” someone else commented. 
“Thinks he’s something special I 
guess.” 

“All right,” Rik-rik said sharply, 
taking charge again. “Back to work, 
all of you. And as for you — ” he 
gave Roan a threatening look — 
“I’ll have my eye on you.” 

“That’s all right,” Roan said. 
“As long as you keep your hands 
off.” 

F or the next eight days Roan 
worked sixteen hours at a 
stretch among the stacks of sup- 
plies, lifting heavier weights than 
he had ever lifted before, climbing 
long, wobbly ladders, counting, tal- 
lying, arranging boxes and cans and 
jars in even rows which the issue 
clerks promptly disarranged. 

When he left the storeroom to 
go to the mess hall or to his room, 
he looked for Stellaraire along the 
corridors and in the rooms he 
passed, but he never saw her. She’s 
forgotten all about me, he thought 
miserably. She fixed up my cuts 
like you’d try to help a scratched 



gracyl who was lying on the ground 
expecting to die. Now she was busy 
with other things — and other peo- 
ple. 

On the ninth day Nugg came to 
the warehouse, signaled to Roan. 

“We’re coming into Chlora; 
planet-fall in a few minutes. Plenty 
to do: tents to set up, midway to lay 
out, rigging to stretch . .” Roan 
followed while Nugg talked in his 
usual grumbling way. 

“I need to know more about 
what I’m supposed to do, if I’m 
going to put on a wire-walking act 
tomorrow,” Roan interrupted. 

“Tonight,” Nugg corrected. “What 
do you need to know? Does a 
Flather need someone to tell it 
how to fly? You’re a Terry wire- 
walker. So walk the wire.” 

There was a sharp change in the 
ship’s gravitation, and Roan caught 
at a hand rail to keep from falling. 
His feet were like lead, suddenly, 
and his breakfast was heavy in his 
stomach. 

“What’s the matter?” Nugg called. 
“Never felt high-G before?” 

“No-no,” Roan said. He swal- 
lowed hard, twice. 

“You’ll get used to it,” Nugg said 
carelessly. 

The gravity pulled and the deck 
trembled and vibrated. There were 
noises and sudden tiltings under- 
foot. A roaring whistle started up, 
went on and on. There was a final, 
violent shudder, and the ship was 
abruptly still. The gravity was worse 
now, if anything. 

“We’re down,” Nugg said. He 
stopped at a door, unlocked it with 
a big electrokey, motioned Roan into 



52 



IF 




a dingy storeroom. He hauled a 
heavy wooden mallet and a vast 
bundle of plastic stakes from a 
shelf, shoved them at Roan. 

“Go ashore and help stake-out. 
There’ll be Mag to show you what 
to do. I heard about the trouble 
between you and Ithc. I got no 
time for any of that. You do your 
job and stay out of his way, see? 
When you finish, go to tent three, 
cell one-o-three, and get ready for 
your stunt.” He walked off, and 
Roan shouldered his load and went 
looking for the debarkation deck. 

A stream of circus creatures were 
pushing into an elevator, and 
carrying a box or piece of equip- 
ment. Roan, caught in the press, 
went into the elevator with them, 
and along the long central corridor 
of the ship and down the ramp, 
out into the strange smell of an- 
other world. 

He started sweating almost im- 
mediately. Th^ heaviness felt worse 
outside, in the heat, and Roan didn’t 
like not knowing where he was 
supposed to go and having only a 
vague idea o«f what to do. 

He was walking across a landing 
field. Not an official, well-groomed 
one, but more like an abandoned 
launching pad; just a flat, cracked 
concrete ramp. Beyond, a garbage- 
dump of a neighborhood crawled up 
a hillside. It reminded Roan depress- 
ingly of home. 

Beyond the garbage-dump neigh- 
borhood reared a blue metal city, 
flashing harshly in the merciless 
sunshine. A flat, shining sky loomed 
overhead. 



The crowd from the circus ship 
thinned out everyone hurrying to 
an appointed task. 

Miraculously, the incredible, mon- 
strous tents began to go up. Roan 
walked toward them. A diminutive 
red-eyed creature scurried up to 
him, pulling a heavy cart that 
bumped over the cracks in ^the 
concrete. It stopped in front of 
Roan and jump^ up ^nd down, 
chattering, waving a stick over- 
head. “Mag! Mag!” Its voice was 
like fingernails on dry wood. 

“I guess you’re Mag,” Roan said. 
“Where do I go?” 

Mag started off with the cart 
again and Roan followed him across 
the field where the garbage was 
being cleared off as the tents went 
up. 

Mag pointed with his stick to a 
spot marked with powdered chalk 
and Roan pounded the first stake 
in. The hammer felt like a tree 
trunk and he brought his whole 
body down with it when he struck. 

After the first stake, he wanted 
to throw the mallet down and sit 
on the ground and catch his breath, 
but Mag chattered and waved his 
stick and danced toward the next 
chalk mark, and Roan followed. 
There were other stake-drivers at 
work, big, thick-armed humanoids 
mostly. They swung their mallets 
with effortless ease, knocking a 
stake into the hard soil with two 
or three easy blows and moving on 
to the next. Roan struggled with 
the heavy mallet, raising it and 
letting it fall. Sometimes he missed 
the stake completely. After each 
stake, he promised himself he would 



EARTHBLCX>D 



53 




rest. But the others never paused, 
and somehow he didn’t want to be 
the first to stop work. His aim got 
worse and worse. He broke one 
stake with a glancing blow, and 
Mag jumped up and down and his 
screeching went up into the super- 
sonic. Roan leaned on his mallet 
and breathed dust, then started in 
again. 

For hours in the blinding sun, 
Roan drove stakes. All around, the 
magic tents rose, cables arcing to 
their high peaks, pennants break- 
ing out to flutter against the steely 
sky. Zoo people came and went car- 
rying props, equipment, tools. Pro- 
cessions of ambling animals with 
caked dung on their flanks went by, 
driven by cursing menagerie-keep- 
ers; a few curious locals wander- 
ed along the now dusty paths be- 
tween the canvas tops, ogling the 
show people. Once Roan looked 
up to see Ithc standing twenty 
yards away, eyeing him, fingering 
the butt of a nerve gun strapped to 
his bird-like hip. His injured hand 
behind him, the tall alien came 
closer, his gill-flaps working ner- 
vously. 

“I’ll — 11 be watching — ing to- 
night when you walk the high wire 
— ire,” he said. “Maybe — aybe 
you’ll fall — all.” 

Roan made his face smile. “Some 
day I’ll catch you alone, without 
a weapon, Ithc,” he said, trying not 
to breathe hard from the stake- 
pounding. “Then I’ll kill you.” 

Ithc showed a gristly ridge where 
teeth should have been, and walked 
away with his queer, gliding walk 
that reminded Roan of the Veed 



and the smell of alien hate and 
cruelty. Ithc wants revenge. Roan 
thought, watching him go. But he 
doesn’t really know what wanting 
means. 

X 

T he stakes were all driven at last, 
and Mag squeaked and took 
his cart away, without even looking 
back. 

Roan found tent three, and in 
Room one-o-three he found two 
Freaks. Two other Freaks, he thought 
wryly. One was a transparent post, 
and it wasn’t until it moved that 
Roan saw it was a creature at all. 
The other was a thing with a hide 
like a skinned tree, covered with 
orange polka dots, and with a dou- 
ble-faced head on one shoulder. Its 
modesty section was apparently ap- 
proximately at the left knee, for it 
was carefully covering it with a 
little patch of black plastiflex. As 
far as Roan could tell, all it was 
covering was an orange polka dot 
exactly like all the others. 

Roan settled for arranging his 
tunic into a skirt, pulling it around 
his belt. 

A bell rang — they seemed to 
ring every few minutes. He fol- 
lowed the first creature out into 
the dust and heat of the midway. 
The creature ambled stiffly over 
to a row of cages, got in one and 
reached a flipper around to close 
the big, fake lock, which was sup- 
posed to indicate that the Freaks 
were dangerous. It motioned Roan 
to the next cage. 

Roan looked curiously at the 



54 



IF 




sign on the bars. PRIMITIVE 
MAN, it said in Panterran, the fifth 
legend in a long row, all in differ- 
ent scripts. He climbed in and 
clanged the door shut and sat on a 
wooden bench. This part of the 
job was easy enough. It felt good 
just to sit and rest. 

Roan sat in his cage for two 
hours. The ponderous creatures erf 
Chlora crowded past, pointing and 
making noises. One Chloran stood 
in front of Roan’s cage for a long 
time, making sketches and taking 
notes in a curious script. Once a 
child prodded him with a long stick. 
But t^y didn’t seem to find Roan 
very spectacular. Most of the Freaks 
were much larger and more color- 
ful. 

Roan hardly noticed the Chlorans 
filing past because he had fallen to 
musing about himself again. Some 
day I’ll find out, he thought. I 
have to know who -I really am, 
who my parents were, where my 
people are — my home. 

Home. Somewhere was home for 
him, and it wasn’t Tambool. 

I’ll take Stellaraire with me and 
we’ll live among our own kind. 
Surely Stellaraire was near enough 
human so it wouldn’t matter. 

Another bell rang. Dusk had 
fallen. Roan noticed. The days 
were short on Chlora. The freak 
exhibit was now empty of specta- 
tors, a garish and lonely place under 
the polyarcs glaring far above. 

Roan got stiffly out of his cage. 
He’d sat too long and his thigh 
had stiffened a bit . again. 

Mag was thef^ waiting for him, 
the little red eyes catching a glitter 



from the arc lights. He chattered 
and hopped on his spidery legs, 
clutching his stick, and Roan fol- 
lowed him through the huge, bil- 
lowing tents. It much cooler now 
that evening had come. Almost 
cold when the wind blew, balloon- 
ing out the tents and flapping against 
the poles. 

Roan walked through the dizzy- 
ing flickers of colored li^ts and 
blasts of noise from the noise- 
makers and the twirling of weird 
creatures. 

At the base of a vast mast as 
big around as Roan, Gom Bulj ap- 
peared from the crowd, his walking 
tentacles rippling as he hurried 
over. 

“Ah, there you are, young Terryl 
You’re on! How’ve you been getting 
along? Now, I’m expecting great 
things of you! See that you per- 
form in a style worthy of the Ex- 
travaganzoo!” 

“What am I supposed to do?” 
Roan asked. “I don’t know any- 
thing about being in a ’zoo. Don’t 
I wear a costume?” 

“Do? Costume?” Gom Bulj pop- 
ped his huge eyes at Roan and 
drummed on his wide torso with 
his thick fingers. “You’re the first 
Freak I’ve had who wanted freak- 
ing lessons. You have expensive 
ideas, young Terry!” He plucked a 
cigar from the flowered waistcoat 
that stretched across his chest, stuck 
it in his mouth. 

“Later on, we’ll see; for the 
present, you’re on probation. Oh, 
it’s a gamble, taking on new talent! 
Never know how the public will 
receive ’em.” He drew a tremendous 



EA^THBLOOD 



55 




breath that made the cigar burn 
bright yellaw, letting the ash fall 
with the insouciance of those who 
never have to clean up after them- 
selves. 

“It wasn’t my idea for you to 
kidnap me,” Roan said. 

“Tush, tush! I’m going to forget 
you said that, young Terry.” Gom 
Bulj flung his red-lined cloak about 
him and rippled his legs. “Good 
hick — and if you should fall, do 
it nicely, as though it were part of 
the act.” He loosed a vast cloud of 
smoke from his air-discharge orifice 
and hurried off. 

M ag pointed with his stick to 
the rungs set in the pole. Roan 
looked i^. He couldn’t see it, but 
somewhere up there, in the back- 
wash of the cacophony of circus 
sounds and colored lights, there 
was a tightrope. 

Ithc strolled up, tall and alien, 
his gills moving in and out, his 
greenish face shadowed sharply 
black in the harsh light. He was 
still wearing the nerve gun. 

“Go — oh up — upp,” he said. 
“All — 11 the way — ay up — up.” 
“I’ll go up,” Roan said. You 
couldn’t do it, but I can. I’m a 
Terran.” A short life and a glorious 
one, he thought, looking up the 
swaying po|e. Stellaraire would be 
down here somewhere; maybe she’d 
be watching him. He’d have to 
throw off the tiredness now, and 
forget the stiffness in his leg. He 
wanted to do his act smoothly, just 
as though he’d been with a ’zoo 
all his life. He wanted her to be 
proud of him. 



He started up the ladder, smiling 
to himself, thinking how she’d look 
at him, what she’d say. He thought 
about her smooth body and he was 
eager to be finished and go and 
find her. 

He climbed endlessly, heavily. He 
stopped to rest halfway up. He 
didn’t want to be tired or breathless. 
It was going to be hard, walking 
the rope with that gravity pulling 
at him. And he felt hot and dizzy 
and his leg ached. 

Roan looked down. Ithc was 
there at the bottom of the ladder, 
a toy Ithc, far off, looking up. If 
he shot Roan with the nerve gun, 
everyone would assume Roan had 
merely fallen. 

Roan climbed, slowly now. He 
was safer on the high wire. Ithc’s 
gun couldn’t reach him that high 
up. But he felt eyes on him and 
looked back again. A bright spot- 
light was on him and so were a 
million eyes. A voice was booming 
over the loud-speaker, in Chloran, 
and Roan knew it was announcing 
him. He heard the word, “Terran.” 

There was noise for him, loud 
and insistent. 

He forgot the eyes and the noise 
and kept climbing. The metal of 
the ladder was cold, from the wind 
glowing on it, and slippery. 

He reached the platform at the 
top. A few feet above him the 
top of the tent billowed and flapped. 
The noise of drums rose to him, 
commanding him on, and the spot- 
light felt like a ray of heat. Every- 
thing seemed to spin slowly, and 
he held onto the flimsy rail for 
support. 



56 



IF 




There was nothing to catch him 
if he fell. 

Roan put a foot on the wire and 
inadvertently looked down. The 
world fell endlessly at his feet. He 
pulled his foot back and felt his 
stomach sweating coldly inside, and 
the fear reaching to hold his body 
rigid. 

He held onto the bars around the 
edge of the platform and shook. He 
was afraid even to stand there on 
the little platform. Fm a coward, 
he thought with horror. But he 
couldn’t do anything about it. All 
he could do was hold on for dear 
life and wonder how he was going 
to get down — and know that Ithc 
was waiting below with the nerve 
gun in case he tried to back down, 
hoping he’d fail. 

Roan wanted to die — but not by 
falling. Just to die now, without 
effort. 

“Roan!” a voice called, faint and 
clear from the middle of the air. 
Roan looked. Stellaraire was on the 
platform at the distant, other end 
of the tightrope. She was dressed 
in gold skintights now, from head 
to toe, and she called, “If you don’t 
come here, Terry, I’m going to come 
there.” 

Roan held on and looked at her. 
He remembered how she had shud- 
dered when he told her what his 
specialty was. But she had climbed 
up here to the crow’s nest to watch 
him. She had known he might need 
her. 

He let go of the rail. Falling 
wasn’t anything. He would just die 
— like Dad. But to fail, and have to 
go on being alive .... 



He went to the taut, black cable, 
stepped out on it, stood balanced 
on the wire that swooped down and 
up again to the blob of light and 
the golden figure. Then he was 
laughing aloud, with relief that he 
wasn’t a coward, and with love for 
his woman, with the deep joy of 
life. 

He walked right across the tight- 
rope, stopping in the middle to wave 
to the invisible faces below. He was 
master of the crowd now, tuned to 
the strong noise of the drums. 

Then he was at the other end 
and Stellaraire caught his hand and 
pulled him close, looking up at 
him, and there were tiny flecks of 
gold dust in her hair. 

44T^^^ould you have done it?” he 
▼ ▼ asked her afterward, when 
they were back on the saw-dusted 
ground among the black shadows 
from the high, hazy polyarcs. 

“I would have tried,” she said. 
“Now it’s time for my dances.” 
She squeezed his hand and slipped 
away in the crowd. As Roan turned 
to follow, he saw ithe’s yellow 
eyes watching from the shadow of 
a ticket booth. 

XI 

S tellaraire’s act was terrific. It 
was an erotic dance in five cul- 
tures, and the Chloran part must 
have been crude enough for the 
crowd to understand, because they 
roared with enjoyment. 

But part of the dance was for 
Roan alone, out of the thousands. 
He liked k. He Bked her being 



EARTHBLOOD 



J7 




his woman, when everybody else 
wanted her. 

“Even I,” said a bald, purplish 
Gloon standing by, “even I can 
find her attractive. She can dance 
in such a way as to seem a regal 
bitch of Gloon. She can be anything 
you want her to be. Anything you 
pay her to be. A tramp of rare 
talent.” 

Roan whirled with his fists 
clenched, but the Gloon was al- 
ready moving off, not even notic- 
ing Roan. 

He watched the dance to the 
end, not enjoying it now. There had 
been other men for Stellaraire, he 
knew that. Even creatures not men. 
But one other thing he knew: she 
wasn’t any tramp. And there 
weren’t going to be any more men 
except Roan. 

After the dances he watched to 
see which way she went, but she 
disappeared through the crowd 
along one of the aisles. 

Half an hour later he was still 
looking for her, along corridors of 
smelly canvas and rope, among sag- 
ging, faded banners and garish lights 
and the shouting of hucksters and 
the blare of noise-makers and the 
clamor of the crowd that seemed to 
be everywhere now, flowing among 
the tents and stalls and poles like 
a rising flood of dirty water, A 
grossly fat being in a curly silver 
wig directed him to Stellaraire’s 
dressing room, after he had asked 
and been ignored or insulted a doz- 
en times. 

But Stellaraire wasn’t in her pink, 
tawdry tent-room. Roan stood there 
undecided, feeling an uneasy sen- 



sation washing up inside of him. 
He wanted her — the reassurance of 
her. He recalled that she smelled 
of young trees. 

“Where did she go?” he asked 
Chela, one of the girls who shared 
the dressing room. “Did you see 
her?” 

Chela was a tiny, graceful sauri- 
an, faintly humanoid, with long, 
heavily made-up eyes. She flapped 
her artificial lashes at Roan and 
showed her little teeth., 

“Ithc came and got her. He 
wanted her for something.” She 
looked demurely at the floor and by 
some trick of musculature curled 
her eyelashes back. 

“There’s always me,” she added, 

“Wanted her for what?” 

“Reely!” 

“Where did they go? Did you 
see?” 

“No. But Ithc lodges in Quadrant 
C.” She was putting purple paint 
on her lip-scales now, bored with 
Roan’s questions. 

He made his way through the 
rings where shows were going on, 
pushed through the crowds on the 
other side. Once, he saw Nugg’s 
heavy, ugly face, and heard him 
call. “Here! Where you think you’re 
going?” But he ignored him, pushed 
on through the crowd. 

There was a taste in his mouth 
that was part fear and part some- 
thing else, he didn’t know what. 
The uneasy feeling was like a sick 
weight inside him. 

A clown was shot from a cannon 
and the smell of gunpowder spread 
through the tent. Lights went off 
and on, and colored spots were a

IF 




kaleidoscope of dancing patterns. 
Roan went through a slit in the back 
of the huge tent into cold night air, 
crossed a path and went into a 
smaller one where most of the 
roustabouts quartered. 

“Where’s Stellaraire?” he asked of 
a wrinkled olive-colored being who 
was sitting on an upturned keg, 
nursing a vast clay mug with both 
hands. 

The oldster let out a long breath. 
“Working.” he said, and winked. 

“Where?” 

“In private.” 

There was a sound — kind of ani- 
mal moan — from the adjoining 
room. Roan flapped through two 
Stiff partitions, • came into a dim, 
cluttered room with a mud-colored 
rug, beaded hangings on the walls, 
the reek of a strange incense. Ithc 
stood across the room, the nerve 
gun awkwardly in his good hand, 
his gills working convulsively. Stell- 
araire stood before him, her golden 
costume torn off one shoulder. One 
arm seemed to hang limp. 

4 C Trance — ance,” Ithc com- 

-L/manded, and aimed the gun 
at her as though he would shoot. 

Tlie double voice issuing from his 
gills seemed to send a shudder 
through the girl. There were several 
circus people ranged along the far 
wall: an under-director whom Roan 
recognized, a pair of Ythcan labor- 
ers, some minor creatures in second- 
string clown costume. One with a 
dope stick blew a cloud of smoke 
at Stellaraire. 

“Come on, dance,” he urged 
carelessly. 



Stellaraire took a step back. 

“Come — umm here — ere.” Ithc 
said. 

She turned to run, and Ithc’s fin- 
ger tightened on the firing stud of 
the nerve gun. 

Stellaraire fell, and Roan heard 
the animal noises again. 

Roan’s body hurt with hers, but he 
held himself rigid, hidden in sha- 
dows. This wasn’t a time for ges- 
tures. Whatever he did now had to 
count. He stepped softly back, 
whirled, ran across the tent where 
the old being hicupped into his beer, 
out into the dark. There were tent 
stakes stacked there, somewhere. 
They were pointed at one end and 
knobbed at the other, and heavy. 
He groped, stumbling among tent 
ropes, feeling over damp ground, 
lumpy refuse, hitting things in 
the dark. His hand fell on a bun- 
dle, and he ripped the twine away, 
caught up a yard-long, wrist-thick 
bar of dense plastic. 

He ran around the tent to the 
side that opened on the alley, lifted 
the heavy flap, stepped* into the 
smell of snakes and Ythcan dope- 
smoke. 

A small clown in colored rags 
was just in front of him. Beyond, 
Ithc stood, tall, lean, slope-shoul- 
dered, long-necked. He was holding 
his bandaged hand close to his side, 
and the other with the nerve gun 
was held awkwardly out. 

That was the first danger. Against 
the gun Roan would have no chance 
at all. There was no question of 
fair play; it was simply necessary to 
save Stellaraire from what was 
happening to her, in any way pos- 



EARTHBLOOD

sible. And he would have to do 
everything right, because he wouldn’t 
have another chance. 

Pe gripped the club carefully, 
stepped quickly past the ragged 
clown, set himself, and brought the 
club down on ithe’s gun-hand. 

He had decided on the hand in- 
stead of the obvious target, the head, 
because be wasn’t sure were Ithe’s 
brains were; hitting him on the 
head might not bother him much. 

It was surprising how slowly 
the gun fell. Ithc was still standing, 
holding his hand out — but now 
the hand was oozing fluid, and the 
gun was bouncing off the dusty 
rug and falling onto a pile of dirty 
clothing, and Ithc was bringing 
his hand in and starting to turn. 
Roan brought the club up again — 
how heavy it seemed — and aimed 
a second blow at the back of Ithe’s 
neck. But Ithc was turning and 
ducked aside. The blow struck him 
on the shoulder and the club glanced 
off and jarred from Roan’s hands, 
and then he was facing the tall, 
pale-green, mad-eyed Ythcan, seeing 
the dirty yellow of the gill fringes 
as the flapped, smelling the pene- 
trating chemical odor of Ithe’s blood. 

“Owww — owww,” Ithc moaned, 
and brought a foot up in a vicious 
kick, but Roan leaned aside, caught 
the longtoed member and threw all 
his strength ipto twisting it back 
and around, driving with his feet 
to topple Ithc. They fell together. 
Roan on top. Ithe’s sinewy body 
buckled under him, and his knobbed 
knees battered against Roan’s chest. 
But he held on, twisting the foot, 
feeling the cartilage crackle and 



break, remembering Dad, and the 
sounds Stellaraire had made, and 
he twisted harder, harder .... 

Ithc roared a vibrating double 
rear, fighting now to escape, but 
Roan reached after him, caught the 
other foot, tore at it, twisting, tear- 
ing, while the now helpless creature 
fought to crawl away. Then Roan 
was on Ithe’s back, his arm locked 
around the other’s throat, crushing 
until Ithc collapsed, fell on his face, 
his legs twitching. 

R oan got to his feet. He was 
only dimly aware of the faces 
watching, of Stellaraire still moving 
on the floor beyond her fallen tor- 
mentor, of the stink of alien blood 
and burning dope. He looked around 
for the club, saw it tangled among 
unwashed garments on an unkempt 
heap of bedding by the sagging can- 
vas wall. He caught it up, turned 
back to Ithc. 

The alien lay half on his side, 
his broken feet grotesquely twisted, 
his gills gaping convulsively. A deep, 
reedy vibration of agony came from 
him. Roan brought the club up, 
and paused, not hesitating, but pick- 
ing the best sp>ot — the spot most 
likely to kill. 

The yellow eyes opened. “Hurry 
— urry,” Ithc sr.id. 

Roan brought the club down with 
all his strength, noting with satis- 
faction that the Ythcan’s limbs all 
jumped at once. 

He hit him twice more, just to 
be sure Ithc would never bother him 
again. The last blow was like pound- 
ing a side of meat hanging in a 
kitchen. He tossed the club aside.

IF 




picked up a dirty blanket and wiped 
the spattered yellowish blood from 
his face and hands. He looked 
around at the circus people who 
watched. Two of the small clowns 
were edging forward, looking Ithc 
over, a little saliva visible at the 
corners of their beak-like mouths. 

“Nobody helped Stellaraire,” he 
said. “Nobody helped me. Anybody 
on Ithc’s side can fight me, if they 
want to.” He glanced toward the 
club, flexing his hands. He was 
breathing hard, but he felt good, 
very good, and he was almost hop- 
ing the other Ythcan would step 
forward, because it had been a won- 
derful feeling, killing Ithc. He felt 
as though he could beat anybody, 
or all of them together. 

But no one moved toward him. 
The one with the dope-stick ground 
the smoke out on a horny palm, 
tucked it in a pocket of its black 
polyon blouse. 

“It’s your fight. Gom Bulj won’t 
like it; Ithc was a valuable piece 
of livestock. But who’ll tell him? 



He may not even notice. Who 
cares?” 

“We’ll take care of the remains'” 
the small clowns said, clustering 
around the body. 1'- 

The others were leaving, wan- 
dering off now because the fun was 
over. Roan went to Stellaraire and 
lifted her in his arms. He was sur- 
prised at how light she was, how 
fragile for all her sumptuous curv- 
ing flesh; and how sharp was his 
need to take care of her. 

She smiled up at him. “He . 
must have gone . crazy.” 

“He won’t bother you any more, 
Stellaraire.” 

Out in the cold night, the blaze 
of stars, the rise and fall of the 
mob-noise, Stellaraire’s arm went 
around his neck. Her face was 
against his. 

“Take me ... to my tent . .” 
she breathed against his throat, and 
he turned and walked along the 
shadowy way, aware only of the 
perfume and the poetry and the 
wonder of the girl.

IF ^ Short Story 



Castles In Space 

by ALAU HILL 



In those days space was adventurous 
and free — and brave men battled to 
the death for a fair lady's favor! 



I n those days no lady was allowed 
any say about how things were 
run. The only reason Kafri was in 
the Throne and Control Room of 
Star Ship Sazarac was that she had 
been sent for to fetch decanters and 
chesspieces. But as she had not been 
told to go, she lingered. 

Two kings, Karl of Avion and 
Kafri’s father, Gurton Redbeard of 
Sazarac, faced each other across a 
carved and gilded table. Beyond 
them the viewing wail was atwinkle 
with multicolor lights, analytical 
pips of the asteroid swarm they had 
both come to mine for fuel ores and 
other supplies. There, also, rode the 
great globular hull of Ship Avion, 
ringed with* a glittering haze of 
scoutships. Either ship alone might 
have done its mining and gone its 
way. But their coming together was 
bad luck. Their knights would sure- 
ly be making trouble for one an- 
other unless the kings could work 
out a protocol. 



But they seemed iiitent only on 
the chessboard. 

Gurton Redbeard slid a bishop to 
one side. Karl rubbed his chin with 
the edge of his forefinger. Gurton 
blew a smoke ring. Karl reached a 
hand, hesitated, shook his head and 
sat back. 

Kafri leaned forward, holding her 
breath. She had often sat to this 
same jewelled game-board against 
her father, and Karl was developing 
an attack she liked herself. Should 
Karl move aright, he’d surely win. 

Gurton Redbeard glanced up side- 
wise. 

“My daughter would not only fill 
our pipes and goblets. Sir Guest,” 
he remarked. “She would also ad- 
vise you how to move.” 

Kafri stiffened. Her father’s tone 
made her suddenly nervous. Of 
course she had no proper — 

King Karl turned toward her, 
laughing. “Would you advise me for 
good or ill. Milady?” 



62 



Oh, she ought to be siding with 
the Home Ship! But in a pinch be- 
tween honesty and manners, Kaiii 
knew that ^e only safe course 
around Redbeard was honesty, and 
as little as possible of that. 

“It — it seems to me. Sir Guest, in 
b-best of my opinions, that if you 
should move y-yon rook to queen 
file — ” She caught her breath to end 
the stammering, cast up her eyes and 
clasped her hands. 

“Ho!” King Karl tilted his head 
this way and that way, twirling a 
blond curl of mustache. “Ha. 
Hmmmm. Phm. Milady, you are as 
wise as you are beautiful, which is 
to say, excessively so. I’ll do it!” 

And he did. 

Kafri clapped both hands to her 
cheeks. Great Space! With that rook 
file open, she saw — now she saw — 
oh, her wily old father had hung his 
guest over a barrel. By the twitching 
of his flaming whiskers, he let her 
see that he had plann^ it all ac- 
cordingly. 

But he sat back, shaking his head 
slowly. 

“The two of ye are too many for 
one old man. I concede!” 

King Karl blinked. Thereupon 
Kaifri realized that he, too, had seen 
it beforehand. Were they, then, both 
making sport of her? 

F eeling much like a kitten between 
lion and tiger, Kafri dropped 
her head in confusion, then flushed 
a curtsy to take up the head motion; 
then backed toward the door to ac- 
count for the curtsy. 

Both men burst out laughing. Kaf- 
ri swirled about, routed and fleeing. 



Gurton Redbeard spoke softly, 
“Wait.” 

Kafri knew that tone. She froze, 
then turned back carefully, not too 
fast. 

Gurton’s next words, however, 
were entirely benevolent. 

“It pleases me, daughter, that you 
favor our guest, for we have been 
talking of a marriage between dur 
two ships, and King Karl has a son 
as like him as mirror and mirror. If 
you will well to wed, then there will 
be a festal peace between our realms, 
and kinsman’s alliance. A fine thing 
that, eh?” 

Wed? 

“Perchance it is a new thought, 
Milady,” King Karl spoke more 
gently, as befitted a guest, a diplo- 
mat, and a negotiator. “Yet we hope 
that you will think well of it. We are 
a great Ship and an honorable clan. 
How say you, then? Will you wed 
my son and join our Clans?” 

Now Kafri was feeling wronged in 
her dignity, having been laughed at; 
if deserv^ly, so much the worse. 
Besides, it hurt her affections to be 
thus parcelled off and sent from 
home. And furthermore, it hurt her 
sense of honesty to be consulted 
about it, for if Gurton Redbeard 
decreed that she should do thus and 
so, what else could she do? She was 
therefore wroth with both of them, 
but mostly with her father, and this 
put her fully into a mood to leave 
home. 

“Aye,” she replied, firmly, “that 
will I, then.” 

So curtsying again, she swished 
her hoopskirts out the door, and this 
time they let her go.

It v/as a well-educated retreat, but- 
without victory. Her nose hurt. Her 
eyes stung. She feared a fit of tears 
and needed to get into Ladies’ Coun- 
try with it. 

' But as she was halfway out the 
throne Room door, she saw two 
ladies far down the corridor: her 
blonde half-sister and the newest of 
their mothers. They had a basket of 
tapestry patterns between them and 
were holding them against the cor- 
ridor wall and spreading them along 
the floor to make choices. Kafri 
durst not weep before her father; 
yet as she knew those two, she cared 
not to do it before them either; so 
she faltered for a moment in the 
doorway and half-turned the other 
way. 

Meanwhile, of course, the door 
had been closing itself, and because 
of her hesitation, Kafri failed to get 
the last bit of ruffle clear; it caught 
in the jamb and stopped her against 
the clc«ed door. There she was teth- 
ered, with the door still open a 
hairsbreadth because of the pinch 
of stuff; and she became aware that 
she was hearing matters she should 
not. 

“ — those mines,” said Redbeard. 
“We can map out shares — ” 

“Softly, neighbor, softly,” Karl 
chuckled. “First the wedding, for 
there have already been affrays. Un- 
til we set a new note we can plan 
nothing further.” 

“Oh surely. And look you, I’ll be 
gladly^ rid of this lass, for such a 
beauty is a problem and a worry con- 
tinual. Every High Day more 
trouble, for as my officers get 
glimpse of her, up starts the poetry 



and the Challenges, with half my of- 
ficers ready to kill the other half, 
instead of, ha, hum, ah — and let me 
be frank with you, neighbor, you had 
best take thought about the same 
trouble in your own Ship.” 

“Pho, my lad will soon have her 
bloat enow, and so an end to poet- 
ry.” 

T here was a familiar scratching 
sound; Redbeard was ruffing 
either his chin or his head hair. 
“Well enow, then. But that is then, 
whereas now is now, and if my 
knights learn of my daughter being 
wed off-ship, why they are a 
mettlesome lot and may take out 
some wrath, you see.” 

There was a pause, Kafri tried, 
very cautiously, to pull her petticoat 
free. But the silken threads were 
strong and the fold of lace secure. 

“You really think it might cause 
trouble to — ‘hm. Ha.Phm.” 

“Verily, if our knights and scouts 
were to see our daughter given off 
Ship, too many of them would be 
ill to control. And then you knights 
and scouts — well, I’d liefer fare forth 
to dig tool diamonds in bare sark.” 
Chairs creaked. 

“Hm. Aye. Well, then, some pri- 
vate arrangement.” 

“Just what I had in mind. Now 
supposing you return to your Ship, 
declaring that you will send young 
Karl back with papers and the like. 
Who will think anything of a spring- 
aid upon an errand? Then we can — ” 
“That, nay, neighbor. Young Karl 
stays v/here he is.” 

“Very well, you can pass for him 
yourself. Another uniform, another

IF 




man, as the saying goes, and it is 
well known that you look full alike. 
Either may pass for other, and the 
main thing is that no great matter 
wiH seem to be afoot. And, as Gen- 
eral Loki pilots your son’s barge, 
who will pick a quarrel without a 
great need for one? Eh? Safe enough 
so far?” 

“Are you saying that we should 
spirit the lass away with but two 
men in a barge?” 

“Aye, why not? Who’d think to 
find a lady in such a place until we 
say she’s gone?” 

“Nay, nay! There’ll be discredit 
to my son and more ill-will than 
good come of it.” 

“Tut, we can shift past that also. 
Stay you here, seeming open and in- 
nocent, and let Loki carry both lass 
and blame; is he not a clanless 
man?” 

“That might — but still.” 

“Oh, keep you General too. The 
ceremony will clear all. And when 
it appears that all is better than ex- 
pect^, then all will rejoice and 
what’s more, get to work.” 

Gurton laughed uproariously, and 
after a moment, Karl joined in. 

Under cover of this noise, KaM 
tugged frantically, tore her skirt free 
and ran for her life, brushing the 
pattern » basket with her billowing 
skirts and scattering the patterns, 
to cries of indignation from both the 
other ladies. These she never stayed 
to answer. 

“Were she not her father’s pet,” 
muttered Tenth Mother, snatching 
for pattern papers that drifted, curl- 
ing, in the afterdraft, “I’d pet her 
handsomely!” 



B ut Kafri escaped to her room, 
drew her skirts well in and 
closed the door tight, letting tears 
well up and flow as she peeled off 
her torn dress and everything else^; 
leaving petticoats in ruffled rings 
across the floor, and dove into her 
coffin. 

There, with the bed foam snug 
around her, s'he wept her utmost. It 
was all the bosom she had to bawl 
on, for her own and First Mother 
was long dead, and Redbeard had 
never taken another official wife, but 
only these fancy dancy concubines, 
long on court etiquette, full of graces 
and wiles, but short on kindness. 

Yet if she must hide her feelings, 
she had them and strongly too. 
Weeping eased her but little; so she 
turned the coffin to cleanse and 
massage, and still she could not rest. 

Flinging the coffin lid open 
again, she jumped out and kicked 
her clothes into a heap. Then she 
tossed everything into the launder, 
including the tom one. Best not have 
that seen again for awhile. She 
dressed hurriedly. 

What had they said — tonight? She 
might be sent for at any time. A 
High Day dress, she’d best. But 
feeling more and more uneasiness, 
a sense of haste, she got out the first 
she found, a silvertissue, new, with 
petticoats looped to show pink un- 
derskirts like petals. 

She studied the effect in the mir- 
rored floor and walls of her room. 
Neat enough from every angle of 
view. But beauty? 

Were the two kings merely dicker- 
ing, or was she? Straight black hair 
that other ladies sniffed over; yet 



CASTLES fN SPACE 



65 




it tramed her face well, didn’t it? 
She had large eyes of a good strong 
blue, and other features that she was 
used to and had been taking for 
granted. What would the strangers of 
Ship Avion think of her? Could she 
compete with concubines — for well 
she knew that all royalty had con- 
cubines — that was the hard question. 
She could only hope so and do her 
best. Strangeness opened out on all 
sides until the very mirror-images of 
herself seemed strange, a host of 
strange ladies in rose and silver, with 
black hair and blue eyes. 

Still no summons from Redbeard. 

But why stand here fidgeting? He 
could find anyone, anywhere on 
Ship. She was minded to take a last 
look at the old places of the only 
home she had ever known — now 
that she was being pushed out of it 
like a chess piece across a game 
board. 

She stepped out of her bright 
room, into the dim corridors. It was 
by now very late, but even so it was 
very dim. The Ship might have to 
limp on half power to some other 
source of supply — ^how could she 
grudge her own duties to her own 
Ship? Kafri shook her head at her- 
self, but still she felt full lorn. 

Lights were full, however, in the 
Nobles’ Nursery. Currently, it held 
only General Bors’ twins, the young 
Arams’ new.born, and her own Least 
Brother — all dear little people, and 
she must not even say good-by. But 
at least she could peep in. 

Least Brother, she found as soon 
as she opened the door, was sound- 
ing off at a princely rate. The room 
was vibrant with sound. The night 



nurse was in a predicament, feeding 
the Bors twins; she had both hands 
full; and though by protocol Least 
Brother came first, there’d be double 
noise if she l>ut the twins down. 

Kafri solved this handily by 
scooping Least Brother out of his 
bunk, and squeezing the howl out of 
him. She was glad to meet one 
simple common problem, and more- 
over Least Brother was so very dear. 
He gave a long informative belch, 
drew in a breath and discovered with 
surprise that nothing hurt any more. 
He let out the breath in a sigh of 
solid comfort, rolled his head oyer 
against her neck and relaxed, going 
heavy, asleep then and there. 

Still Kafri held him awhile be- 
fore putting him down. Least Brother 
was such a good size to cuddle. His 
demands were so few, so honest, and 
if sometimes loud at least always 
understandable. Would she have 
children of her own? Most ladies did, 
but some never. Life made its own 
terms. 

When she put Least Brother back 
into his bunk, he ignored her, re- 
laxed as he was in sleep and perfect 
trust. Just so; and should she panic 
either? She felt a little better, but her 
thoughts were still ill-sorted. 

When she stepped into the cor- 
ridor again, she found a scrap of 
luck — a bit of lace blowing in the 
night drafts that whispered in the 
dim corridors. Then it hadn’t been 
noticed! Feeling fortunate, she 
caught it up for a souvenir — ^and to 
keep it from being found by some- 
one else who might get to thinking 
and maybe talking and maybe annoy 
Redbeard — -and all precautions 



66 



IF 




against annoying Redbeard were 
lucky moves. 

I t was now full darktime, when no- 
body used the corridors except a 
few watchmen. She turned towards 
Weavers* Country, avoided a pass- 
ing sentry, tiptoed the other way and 
came to Farm Country, where there 
was always some ligjit, but also many 
green and scented shadows. 

Here, among the bean vines, she 
heard sounds of sobbing, and found 
Ninth Mother in a dark mood. These 
ladies outranked Kafri and rather 
liked to keep her aware of it. To 
find one of diem thus upset was an 
odd event in a day full of odd events. 
The upshot of their conversation was 
that the ladies exchanged fashion ad- 
vice and then swapped dresses, trad- 
ing the bright new gown for Ninth 
Mother’s black lace. This turned out 
lucky later on, when another sentry 
might have seen Kafri and asked em- 
barrassing questions; but she looked 
so like a shadow that he never 
noticed her. 

In this way, wishing hard that she 
did not have to leave this home she 
kntw so well. Kafri came to a door 
she had never seen before. But then 
she had never come so far into Farm 
Country except by open paths. This 
door stood close behind a high bank 
of flowering tomato vines. The paint 
on its threshold looked diy and 
clean, as if the door were little used. 
That might be, for it was plainly 
marked: 

AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL 
ONLY 



The thing is, that when a girl feels 
uneasy enough, authoiizaitions mean 
less. Here in her own home was a 
place that she had never known of, 
and this was her last chance to see 
what lay beyond that door. 

First she hid her slippers under a 
tangle of leaves. Next she stepped 
quietly up to the door and pushed 
it very carefully. It went back easily, 
without a sound. 

Nothing but a stairwell — a narrow 
stairwell, leading down into darkness 
from the light of Faim Country 
that came past her own downward- 
pointing shadow. 

Somewhere down there was a 
sound of — ^what? 

H<4ding her hoops so as not to 
rustle, she snoolded gently across 
the landing, down the steps, shoul- 
der to wall, turning angjes, careful, 
careful, into the deep darkness. 

The sounds grew louder. Machin- 
ery. Space, what a rumpus! Coarse 
footing too, and die bad left her 
slippers. Stilly bare toes were better 
for feeling her way down, down. 

Now dim light again, louder racket 
of machinery. A loading platform 
perhaps — a wide shelf with bays at 
the side, and heaps of boxes here and 
there. Then turning a corner, the 
shelf stood flat and open to a wide 
doorless arch, sharp-edged light, 
open distance, huge. Were there far 
walls? Too far to be sure. 

Why, this must be the loading 
docks for all Ship Sazarac! No place 
for ladies, so of course she had never 
seen it. 

What a place! Fascinated, Kafri 
slid behind a stack of boxes and 
peered beyond. This was better than

High Days. They should let ladies 
in once in awhile, if only to see the 
shows! 

Noise, color, motion, so many 
things going on. Nearest, the two- 
pilot fighting scouts, the ship’s strik- 
ing force in space — ^rows and rows 
of racks. Beyond were several 
freighters. Beyond those, jumbling 
distance. 

But she saw no people. 

Where were the Knights, Techs 
and Mechs? Robot-4rucks rolled 
about and accounted for the clan- 
gor, and machinery was in motion 
as far as she could see; but not one 
attendant nor even one guard. How 
much power these things must use! 

Nearest the arch was a vacant 
space widi a row of open blister- 
ports. As Kafri watched — how long? 
five minutes or an hour — one of 
the blisters dosed, rolled and peeled 
open again, revealing a large hand- 
some scoutship marked with the 
royal comets and the golden harp of 
Clan Avion. Ah, that must be that 
barge that Kafri had heard spoken 
of; her father’s plans must be well 
forward. Strictly speaking, she ought 
to be now in her own room await- 
ing — why, people must be seeking 
her now! 

This was indeed embarrassing. 
But just as Kafri turned to go back 
as she had come, she saw movement 
in that direction also, and dropped 
further behind the boxes instead, 
glad of the roughness of the heap 
and its nook of concealment. 

r ie movement was caused by the 
swinging beams of flashlights. 
As they rounded the corner, how- 



ever, one light after another was 
snapped off. Kafri glimpsed a num- 
ber of officers, led it seemed by 
Redbeard himself. They strode to 
the landing that contained the Avion 
barge; They tapped a signal on the 
hull. 

The lock dilated and King Karl 
stepped out. He had shaved off his 
whiskers and wore the simple uni- 
form of a fighter pilot with just the 
royal shoidder-b^ge; but Kafri 
knew him because she expected all 
this. Still it was strange to' see it all 
happening. Until now, she realized, 
this whole odd plan had sounded 
like all-ta^. Nothing more, really. 
Was that part of why she had been 
so much adrift in her feelings about 
k? 

Now at diis point she had a good 
chance to scoot for the back stairs 
and turn up in some reasonable 
place looking innocent. But she 
stayed. Partly she was too nervous 
to move, and partly, too curious. 

Was there anyone else in that 
barge? General Lx>ki? She’d heard 
about him lots of times, court gossip 
was full of stories about what he 
had done and might do next. There, 
he stepped out, stooping to pass the 
lock: a huge dark man. The officers 
shook hands all around. Then Loki 
swung back inside the lock, while 
the others turned and came straight 
back, snapping on lights as they 
came. 

Kafri held still, still. 

Nobody seemed to see her. Why 
should they expect anyone in such a 
spot at such an hour? Perhaps they 
could not have seen her in any 
case; the brighter the light, the deep- 



68 



IP 




er the shadow. But how strange It 
was that Gurton Redbeard, who left 
no detail to chance, wasn’t having 
her paged over every speaker in the 
Ship- 

Just beyond Kafri’s heap of boxes 
another switch clicked, but no light 
came on. 

“Blast these dim places and hard 
times,” roared Redbeard, genially, 
“General Bors, will you oblige us 
with your flash?” 

Still bellowing hospitalities and 
encouragements, right there he took 
from Bor’s hand not a light but 
something that glimmered like a 
proffered blaster. It was a. blaster. 
It flared momentarily and Karl 
sagged instantly. 

“Flash doesn’t work either, eh?” 
Shouted Redbeard without a break. 
“Nothing for it but to shuffle our 
way to a light that will goj^n for us.” 
Then, in a lower tone, “Bors, go you 
back and tell Loki his royal master 
wants him. Then get rid of him as 
you like. We’ll be creating such a 
towse about sudden illness and royal 
cremation and clan rituals that Av- 
ion will be all amort and none will 
think of Loki. But Loki thinks for 
himself, so make sure of him.” 

B ors ran , back, while the others 
tramped off, around the corner 
and gone. One was dragging, but in 
the huddle and darkness even with 
what Kafri now knew, she could 
hardly be sure. Cremation? That 
great hearty confident man, dead? 

Why, her father had planned it 
that way! No wonder he hadn’t cared 
where she was! She had only been 
a bit of bait in a trap for two great 



men — and there went Bors to take 
the other. 

Grand Champion Loki, however, 
was not so quick to outsmart him- 
self and step into a dark place 
among strangers. He came out again 
and stood listening; but whatever 
Bors said, Loki merely shook his 
head without speaking, with "each 
hand on a butt of his two belt 
blasters. 

Kafri felt a great horror of all 
that had happened. “That’s right, 
Loki,” she whispered. But it was 
only a small whisper. “Don’t trust 
him, or you’re done, too.” 

Presently Bors came back, shaking 
his head. But he could get other 
men, or for that matter get guns and 
blaze down this tunnel. 

The Alarm for General Assembly 
began to sound through the walls. 
The robotrucks halted where they 
were. Then in the silence, the royal 
dirge music began, beautiful and ter- 
rible. 

Loki’s head jerked at the sound, 
but then he stiffened. Oh, that was 
a mistake, a mistake! It wasn’t a 
time to be brave, it was a time to 
run! There was evil all around! 

It came to Kafri that she had 
hated her father for a long time — 
for his wickedness, for his violence, 
for his treachery. She had seen it 
all many times, and had never 
thought to question it. Redbeard was 
Redbeard, the Head of the Clan. But 
now she had to think about it. 
Hatred for all this evil opened in her 
heart like a black flower. 

And for that moment there was no 
one there but that one lone man. 
Oh, if somebody should warn him! 



CASTLES IN SPACE 



69 




But who was there to do that ex- 
cept — 

Before she could change her mind, 
Kafri ran down the tunnel and 
burst into the light. 

“They’ve killed him!” she cried. 
“Killed him by treachery! I saw it!” 
She pushed with both hands at the 
startled knight. “There’s naught you 
can do here! In, man, in! Close lock 
and get away if you can!” 

Loki said a word no lady 
should hear or recognize. He 
grabbed her arm and flung her into 
the barge before she knew what 
next. He jumped for the controls 
and punched this, slapped that — the 
airlock hummed shut, spunggg, even 
as the ship rolled. Kafri was tossed 
about until she slid into a comer and 
was cramped there by the forces of 
a fast departure. 

Loki, seemed to ride these man- 
euvers as easily as a boy on a fun 
slide. 

However, he was no boy. Actually, 
she had never seen so big a man. 
He was wearing the green uniform 
of Ship Avion with general’s pips, 
but no clan device. He was as dark 
as Kafri, and she saw that he was 
blue-eyed also, but of a masculine 
hardness. He turned a dial with some 
care, and then spoke, not in a dip- 
lomat’s light tones, but a heavy male 
bass. 

** Avion? Avion? O.S. Come in. 
Ship Avion. Barge calling; O.S.” He 
flicked a toggle. “Its too weak a 
signal,” he growled. “However! 
Thatll send until we come into 
range and then all Avlon'W swarm 
out like bees and give yon hive 
something to think on.” 



H e slid a lever and the ship’s 
gain loosened a little. Kafri 
found that she could straighten out, 
and needed to. 

Loki reached a hand, pulled her 
up standing, and looked her over. 
He grinned broadly. 

“Art a slut to betray your own 
ship. But a handsomer slut saw — 
I — never.” 

Kafri nodded; his point was fair- 
ly taken. 

“Aye, sir, you speak truth about 
betrayals. But consider what my 
father has done, and under truce 
too. It’s honesty to uphold that? 
And consider you sir, that I prom- 
ised to wed young Karl. So it’s to 
betray this one or that one, but 
at least I betray not my own prom- 
ise or the Laws of the Clans, do I?” 
He stared, then began to laugh. 
“You’re Kafri of Sazarac? The 
Dark Rose herself? By space, I 
might’ve — ” 

Considering that the outposts of 
Sazarac were scarcely passed, Loki 
was rather too much relaxed; yet 
Kafri felt a little better too. 

“And if Karl is honorable — he 
is, isn’t he?” 

“As the starts are true. And I 
should know, for we’ve ridden co- 
pilot on many a mission,” Loki 
said, sobering. He glanced at a 
viewport, turned quickly and 
slapped the controls again. Kafri 
saw him in time to catch at a brace 
as the boat surged forward or she’d 
have been thrown again. 

“It seems your Clan is out. Mi- 
lady.” 

TTie view port above die panels

IF 




Sazarac — filled most of the space; 
but there was a snippet of black at 
the lower curve. Against this there 
showed a swarm of golden needles: 
scoutships pouring out on their track. 
But they had a fast ship and a head- 
start, so surely this was no more 
than a gesture? 

“You’ll have to strip and lock 
into the co-pilot’s coffin, Milady. We 
may gain something by dodging.” 
“Dodge?” 

“Aye! and hurry! For at this 
speed, you’d be dashed to spatters 
even if we’re not shot to powder!” 
“Shot?” She blinked. “Do you 
suppose my cousins would shoot at 
a scoutship with a lady in it?” 

“Oh, blast and jet wash all fool 
girls, d’y’think this is all in High 
Council Hall where all shall be 
known? Strip!” he blurted, flipping 
her around, expertly unshucking all 
her petticoats and tossing them over 
her head. “This is politics, y’brain- 
less poppet!” A button caught as 
she floundered among ruffles, but 
he snapped it off, pulled the whole 
thing loose, bodice and all, tossed 
the mass into a side locker and 
kicked that shut with a sweep of one 
boot. Meanwhile he was saying, 
“D'ye’think we have time to stand 
wondering what they’ll do, when it’s 
as plain as — ” 

He caught her under the ribs with 
one hand and assisted — that is, 
tossed — her into the co-pilots cof- 
fin, face down. “D’y’think we design 
control couches to fit ladies’ hoops?” 
Kafri found that she could see 
the control panel and could move 
her hands, which were close by it. 
“AND DON’T TOUCH THOSE 

CASTLES rN SPACE 



CONTROLS!” His deep voice 
echoed her very thought and the 
boom of the coffin-^lid. A moment 
later the same voice came through 
the panel speaker. “Look through 
the viewport.” 

S he was doing that. Great Sazarac 
seemed to be swinging upward; 
the blackness below increased pro- 
portionately, filled with the dancing 
swarm of pursuit .... 

“Now, Milady, d’y’see those three 
nearest?” 

“Nearest?” 

“Aye!” Several bad words. “Larg- 
est, then.” Everything in the pic- 
ture yawed and swung. A central 
dimness grew, barred ‘with an X of 
something like light. “There. Can 
y’read the insignia?” 

They were tiny but discrim in- 
able. 

“General Bors, that’s the largest, 
I mean, nearest. Doest rampant on 
a field cheeky. The two dragons 
entwined — General Ysem. Comets 
and luces argent, bend sinister — 
my cousin. Prince Aram. As I 
thought. Fastest ships in this part of 
space. Now I’ll let them know you’re 
aboard.” Light increased in the con- 
trol panels, and she blinked. “They 
can all see your face and they can 
hear what I’m saying now, as well a^ 
you can see their ships. Hear me, 
you cowards? Any one of you sorry 
to see Loki running like a bat. 
with only a girl for a gunner?” 

The leading ship flashed a rod of 
flame, reaching, reaching — and the 
ship rolled and lurched. The view- 
point filled with white fire. Some- 
thing hissed on the hull. 

n 




The foam around Kafri seemed 
to loosen as the ship flipped and 
dived — that must’ve been a near 
miss, or they’d not be here knowing 
about it, she knew very well. The 
viewport was full of swirls, noth- 
ing that she could distinguish, every- 
thing was erractic. Loki was swear- 
ing a torrent — beautiful deep voice, 
horrible black words. Kafri gathered 
the sense of his remarks: that they 
were being overhauled three to one, 
and that their pursuers were shoot- 
ing full power. Loki said a good deal 
more than that, but much was in 
words she had never heard and 
couldn’t interpret. 

She listened and looked, help- 
less. Any moment now, death? 
Would she feel h? How would it 
feel? 

Loki stopped swearing. The pic- 
ture steadi^, let the swarm of pur- 
suit come into view. Most of the 
specks were smaller, some very tiny, 
and Ship Sazarac had shrunk to a 
ball with black space all around it. 
But three — yes. They were bigger. 

The center of the picture thinned 
and made the X again; much larger 
than before — Bors, Ysem, Ar^m, 
as if on murder bent, all glowing 
with charges ready. 

On Ysem, a spark swelled, but 
before it could do more, the ship 
lurched, the picture reeled. Intoler- 
able light flared and vanished at one 
side of the rear-view port. 

Loki gave a sort of half cough. 

“Milady! D’y’see that red stud 
under your right hand?” 

It was the biggest thing on the 
panel. “You mean this thing mark- 
ed ‘Salute’?” 



“Salute guns and a girl,” Loki ex- 
pressed a few more sentiments, then 
gave that half cough again. “That 
same. Now, if we come about and go 
inside their. range, d’y’think y’could 
push that button just when I say 
and only when I say? My hands are 
both — Whoops! NOW!” 

K afri jabbed at the button, hard, 
with fist behind thumb. 

There was a crackling and spit- 
ting, a backthrust, and light that 
struck through her closed eyelids. 
When she looked again, the view- 
port was full of stars again, and 
three ships rocking into view — no, 
two ships and a ball of light that 
grew and grew. 

“See the range finder? That 
scope with the cross hairs? When it 
centers on — NOW! And HOOOLD 
it!” 

Kafri shut her eyes as she punched 
the stud, for now she knew what it 
did. But she punched it, hard as 
ever. 

Again the boat spun, and a great 
surge drove it. Her ears rang, her 
thumb slipped off the stud. She 
looked again, saw the swirling stars, 
saw a pursuit ship fire at them and 
miss clean. Then the other ship was 
zigging around in the range finder; 
and as it caught in the crux, Kafri 
punched the red stud again without 
being told. 

Logi gave a great shout. The ship 
steadied and flew weightless in a 
straightforward rush. Kafri opened 
her eyes. 

Bors, Ysem, Aram, her kinsmen. 
Three clouds of sparks with cores 
of fire, growing from the center. 



72 



IF 




diimning at the edges. Aram, Ysem, 
Bors. 

The lid of the control coffin 
swung open. Kafri looked over her 
shoulder and there stood Lx>ki, 
laughing like a madman. 

“Ah, ha — ha, ha — that was im- 
possible — ah, ha — but we did it! 
Girl, y’learn fast! Come out of that 
and kiss me!” 

She could hardly move. She un- 
derstood that they were lucky to 
be alive, but all she felt was a shud- 
dering horror at the world and 
everything in it, a cold place full 
of enormous grief. She came to her 
knees, tears dripping unstayed. 

“Please, J, want my clothes,” she 
babbled. “Please — my dress.” 

Loki kicked the locker open and 
flung the mass of garments at her. 
He turned his back and stared out 
the viewport while she fumbled her 
way through the tangle, and worked 
her appearance back to decency. 
Then, having done what she hoped 
was enough, she sat huddled, think- 
ing on blackness. 

Loki gave that half cough. “Can 
I look around?” 

“You looked before.” 

“I apologize.” 

“Don’t be; angry.” 

“WHAT FOR!” 

“Well, you are yelling.” 

“OH, for — all right.” 

“Then, you’re not angry?” She 
was sorry for him too. None of it 
was his fault in any way. She went 
and put her hand on his arm. He 
jerked it away as if burnt. 

“Don’t touch me. Milady. I’ll be 
all right in a minute or so, but just 
don’t touch me now.” 



She drew back carefidly and sat 
on the edge of the control coffin. 
It was hard and too narrow. She 
got up, found the lever and closed 
the lid gently. Then she stood and 
watched Loki, while he watched the 
viewport. 

H e had turned it away from Ship 
Sazarac; but SWp Avion, 
though nearer now, was Rowing 
only a crescent at one side, high 
and to the left. Much nearer were 
the masses of the asteroid swarm. 
They swelled and passed, until the 
ship seemed to be in the midst of 
them. There was a gentle jolt, and 
all forward motion seemed to cease. 

Loki began fiddling with dials 
at one side of the panel, and a 
small crackling began. 

“Cancel 6.S.”, he said, slowly. 
“Report coming. This is Loki; call 
Karl at once.” There was a slight 
pause. “Good, I thought you’d be 
there, Karl. Bad news, lad; Sazarac 
broke truse. Your father’s dead, they 
say, and by treachery, for I was 
fired upon as I tried to get back with 
— ” The crackling begain again. 
“Truce, aye, and fired upon, aye! 
D’y’know my voice? D’y’doubt my 
word?” More crackling. “So now 
y’know what to expect, y’ll know 
what to do. I’ve taken cover among 
asteroids, for I must check hull 
damage. I said hull damage. Great 
space, man, d’y’think they were 
spraying tourney spark? Call council 
and don’t wait on me. Over and 
out.” 

He turned to Kafri. 

“Now, lass, you have three 
choices. Fair’s fair, and I owe you 



CASTLES tN SPACE 



73 




justice, for had you not interf erred 
I’d now be dead as King Karl — 
long live King Karl. So say what 
you want. Imprimis, if you want to 
be set back among your kindred, 
snivels and all, risks and all, PU 
try if it can be done. And perhaps 
it can with the right kind of care 
about arrangement. Now is that what 
you want?” 

Kafri shook her head emphatical- 
ly, with a quick shiver. Ship Sazarac 
was home no more to her. 

“Secondus, we can proceed to 
Avion as soon as I make sure that 
all’s in order about this boat. Now 
Karl is an honorable man, so he’ll 
probably keep his father’s word and 
wed you. But I warn you fairly, lass, 
there’s another he promised before, 
and he’s his own master now. You’d 
not be. First Lady.” 

Kafri smiled a little. “I think 
that maybe it’s harder to be a great 
lady than a small one, and I should 
know about that. Did you say there 
are three choices?” 

“Why, you could come with me. 
1 am a clanless man, nothing to 
keep me here, but I have a strong- 
hold on an unpeopled planet. The 
winters are long there, but the sum- 
mers are as lovely as yourself, and 
fairer lass saw I never.” 

Could it be that easy? “Wouldn’t 
we be sought for? Could you fight 
off all—.” 

-He snorted. “Fight off dl what? 
Karl and Gurton will keep one an- 



other busy, doubt you not. We’ll be 
supposed lost by wreck among these 
flying crags, and maybe sought for 
here, for awhile, as a mote in a 
dustbin. Karl owes me thanks and 
friendship. But running a Star Ship 
takes a man’s mind up full. We’d be 
soon forgotten among so many other 
things.” 

That was a strange thought. Yet 
Kafri was sure of one thing, and that 
was that between yonder slippery 
preoccupied folk, and this hard- 
spoken fast-acting man, she felt a 
strong personal preference, had been 
feeling it all along and acting on it. 

“I could run with you now, lass, 
and who’d prevent mj?v But fair 
is fair, you shall say fo^ yourself.” 
He added, anxiously, “You under- 
stand, lass, it’s a far place. There’d 
be no other ladies, and few diver- 
sions.” 

It sounded fine. Kafri began to 
feel anxious too. “I can play chess,” 
she proffered. “But I guess maybe 
not very well.” 

He looked at her sharply, then 
grinned, then chuckled. Well, if he 
thought it funny — she giggled. Then 
they both burst out laughing. 

I n this way, Kafri had her own 
say, in spite of being Redbeard’s 
daughter, or perhaps because of it. 
But as to who got the asteroids, sihe 
never did hear, and never did think 
it very important.

OUR MAN IN FANDOM 

by UN CARTER . 

First of a new series. Here's 
your chance to learn all about 
fandom — what it is — and whyl 



You Read Tlicit Crazy Buck Rogers Stuff? 

H OW did science fiction fandom 
get started? There are as many 
different theories as there are fans. 
I have my own private theory: I 
think, like Arch Obeler’s chicken 
heart, it just grew. It started back 
in the old days (often called The 
Good Old Days), something like 
this. Professor, a little mood music, 
if you please, whilst we take a trip 
down Mem’ry Lane . 

Back when we were in our teens, 
there were none of the neat digni- 
fied little paperbacks we have today. 
Nossir ... we had pulp magazines, 
great sloppy ragged-edged things, 
printed on an inferior grade of blot- 
ting paper — with titles that were a 
far cry from the simple, intellectual- 
sounding ones of today like Galaxy 
Science Fiction or Analog (which 
sound like they ought to be titles of 
M.I.T. alumni magazines, or some- 
thing equally technological and for- 
midable). Titles in those days were 
calculated to arouse parental fears, 
ghastly ones like Eerie Interstellar 



Thrills or Stupefying Rocketship 
Sagas, and like that. Also parsecs 
away from the good taste of today’s 
magazines covers, the covers of yore 
were shrieking blots of raw color, 
invariably depicting a platinum 
blonde whose amazing degree of 
mammalian endowment would have 
made her a collector’s item for any 
wide-awake medical school. She was 
generally clothed in a chrome-plated 
brassiere, a suit of cellophane paja- 
mas and a goldfish-bowl space hel- 
met, and was shown in the multi- 
tentacled grip of a green cockroach 
with octopoid limbs, a bewildering 
assortment of claws, dripping fangs, 
bat-wings, and enormous blood-shot 
eyes . three of them, at least. In 
the rear, huffing along variantly to 
the rescue, came a blond, square- 
jawed hero with a grim, slightly 
constipated expression, clutching a 
blaster composed largely of old radio 
tubes. 

As you can see, it was tough try- 
ing to defend such reading matter 
on grounds of imagination-stretching 
scientific stimulus. As a matter of 



75 





fact, it was hard enough just getting 
the things in the house. You bought 
the latest issue of Gory Galactic 
Shockers — trying to ignore the pig- 
gy, suspicious eye of the newsdealer 
who grudgingly accepted your quar- 
ter, growling around the chewed 
cigar-stump in his mouth some com- 
ment about “Punk kids, readin’ this 
trash, oughta be out playin’ ball.” 
You bore your prize home, covers 
carefully folded back out of sight; 
smuggled it surreptitiously into the 
house, past Pop who would glare up 
from the racing form and grumble 
something about “Punk kid, alia 
time nose inna book, oughta be out 
playin’ ball”; and, in the seclusion 
of your room, you would read every 
precious word . yes, even the ads 
in the back: Ruptured? Throw 

Away That Smelly Old Truss! and 
Great Money-Making Home Busi- 
ness — Weave Your Own Ties on 
Goldblitz’s Patent Hand-Loom! 

Now, one thing the old pulp mag- 
azines had was a regular letter col- 
umn. Editors actually encouraged 
readers to write in their comments 
(probably for evidence to justify the 
magazine’s continued existence to a 
publisher who probably thought 
such kids oughta be out playin’ ball). 
For lack of any local companion- 
ship with whom to share your opin- 
ions of your favorite stories and au- 
thors, you would be forced to write 
letters ^ to these columns yourself. 
These letters, almost without fail, 
graded every story and illustration 
in the issue via a complex numbered 
scale. Invariably, they deplored the 
cover art, and requested the next is- 
sue have trimmed edges, be expanded 



by 75 pages, and feature a cover by 
Bok or Finlay. Often these letters 
were witty and downright clever; 
personalities emerged, frequently 
more marked and original than those 
displayed by the professional writers 
whose fictions the magazine fea- 
tured. Sometimes you wrote person- 
ally to a letterhack whose opinions 
matched, or violently contrasted, 
with yours. Or you would have let- 
ters published, and other letterhacks 
would write to you. Correspondence 
sprung up; you made a far wider 
circle of friends via the mails than 
you had in P.S. 109. 

Sometimes you would discover that 
four or five other sf readers lived 
right in the old home town. Infor- 
mal clubs came into being. Then 
regional groups and even national 
organizations. Arch Oboler’s chicken 
heart was under weigh.

C OSGROVE’S Law states that all 
readers are potential writers, 
and all writers are would-be editors. 
This is true of sf. The phenomenon 
of fan magazine publishing is now 
attracting serious attention, and fan- 
zines are being collected by more 
than one college. What a boon to 
thesis writers of tomorrow, in search 
for something to research! 

Fanzines come in all shapes and 
sizes. In the Good Old Days, many 
were hectographed — a cheap form 
of printing that involved messy trays 
of highly odorous jelly, and gave you 



76 



IF 




a pair of pale purple hands for sev- 
eral days. The mimeograph, that 
noble gift of the American inventor, 
has proved the most popular form 
of printing. But actual-no-kidding 
printed fanzines are not altogether 
unknown, whether handset on the 
basement press, or commercially 
done, as in a few rare cases. Well- 
heeled fans with indulgent parents 
have from time to time extruded 
mags first lithographed, then (and 
now commonly) printed by photo- 
offset. 

What does an average fanzine 
look like? Mimeographed, sometimes 
most attractively so, on colored pa- 
per; about a dozen pages long (al- 
though some have been known to 
run 100 pages, and even more); sta- 
pled dong the left margin; with a 
cover drawing done on stencil, or 
sometimes a litho’ed or offset pen 
and ink drawing. Contents vary. 
Usually an editorial explained why 
this issue is so late. A clutch of ar- 
ticles ... a short story or two . 
fannish cartoons . poems ... al- 
most always a lengthy letter-column. 
From time to time, fanzines conduct 
polls, review books or other fan- 
zines, have contests, etc. You name 
it: fanzines have printed it. 

The fan press, more than just a 
mildly interesting facet of Ameri- 
cana, has a practical value. Fanzines 
are a testing-ground for future pro- 
fessionals in science fiction. H. P. 
Lovecraft used to publish an ama- 
teur magazine, and many of his early 
stories were first published in these 
journals. Fans have gone on to be- 



come well-known writers — Ray 
Bradbury (who used to edit some- 
thing called Futuria Fantasia), Fred 
Pohl, Algis Budry (his magazine was 
called Slantasy), Wilson “Bob” 
Tucker {Le Zombie), C. M. Korn- 
bluth, Damon Knight Robert Silver- 
berg, Marion Zimmer Bradley (she 
still edits one) — the list 4s almost 
endless. 

More than just writers, fans move 
on in greater numbers to fill the 
ranks of magazine editors and book 
or paperback publishers. Marty 
Greenberg (Gnome Press), Lloyd 
Arthur Eshbach (Fantasy Press), 
Ray Palmer {Amazing Stories), Don- 
ald A. Wollheim (Ace Books), Lar- 
ry Shaw (Lancer Books), Robert 
W. Lowndes (Science Fiction Sto- 
ries, Avalon Books, etc.), Terry 
Carr (also at Ace), Ted Dikty and 
Mel Korshak (Shasta Press), Forry 
Ackerman (Famous Monsters of 
Filmland), and reams of others 
started as members of the Beanie 
Brigade. 

But beyond even this, there are 
those potential professionals who 
gain confidence in the fan journals 
before moving into the ranks of paid 
members. The late Hannes Bok first 
appeared in fanzines. Robert Bloch 
and Isaac Asimov have had almost as 
many appearances in the fan press 
as in newsstand publications. The 
sword-and-sorcery fanzine, Amra, 
was publishing the artwork of Roy G. 
Krenkel and Frank Frazetta long 
before the Burroughs Boom carried 
them to professional paperback cov- 
ers.

Punk Kids, Alla Time Printin' This Junk, 

's a Waste a Moneyl 

W HAT makes a guy pour out all 
the time and money and ef- 
fort that publishing and mailing a 
fanzine demands? What does he get 
for it in return? Sure, fanzine edi- 
tors usually charge a dollar or so for 
a year’s subscription, but hardly ever 
do they break even, what with paper 
prices, printing costs, postage, and 
so on. And it takes a lot of time, 
stenciling each page, running it off, 
collating, assembling, stapling, ad- 
dressing, bundling, mailing. What 
does the editor get out of it, that 
makes it worth his time? 

That’s a hard question to answer. 
Anyone with the creative itch already 
knows the answer, but it’s a tenuous 
and elusive thing to pin down on 
paper with mere words. Joe Fan-ed 
gets pride of accomplishment. Pride 
in a job well done. And if what he’s 
produced is of value, he gets a cer- 
tain prestige. Today, a decade after 
they went into the limbo that swal- 
lows all fanzines eventually, we still 
have a fond regard for those really 
good fanzine editors of the past: 
Charles Burbee whose Shangri-U- 
Affairs was such a delight, Walt 
Daugherty of Chanticleer, Gus Will- 
morth and (after him) Roy Squires 
of Fantasy Advertiser, Donald Day 
of The Fanscient, Stan Mullen of 
Gorgon, Ron and Cindy Smith whose 
Inside was one of the finest fanzines 
ever, Dick and Pat Lupoff of Xero, 
Never underestimate the presti- 
giousness of a fine fanzine. Many 
the pimply adolescent, ignored by 
girls, snickered at by football stars. 



was, unbeknownst to his classmates, 
an international celebrity in the 
science fiction world. And sometimes 
fanzines have produced more im- 
mediate and tangible results: Char- 
les D. Hornig, who published a mag 
called The Fantasy Fan, attracted 
the eye of Hugo Gernsback, who 
pulled him out of the fan ranks and 
lifted him to the lofty post of editor 
of a genuine science fiction maga- 
zine, Wonder Stories. This is quite a 
noteworthy event, considering that 
Hornig was naught but a 17-year-old 
fan from Jersey City, N. J.! 

Fanzines have other constructive 
features, beside serving as boot- 
camps for would-be pros. They seek 
out and print all kinds of valuable 
material of permanent worth which 
no commercial magazine in the field 
would dream of touching with a ten- 
foot blue pencil. They serve as natur- 
al vehicles for satire — lampoon — 
parody. They also print the sort of 
scholarly critiques of important 
works that could never appear in a 
professional magazine. For example, 
parody has given us a series of de- 
lightful Gilbert & Sullivan versions 
of famous SF novels, originally fan- 
published by author Randall Gar- 
rett, who must have despaired of 
ever selling them anywhere (they 
were so good, though, that Old-Time 
Fan Doc Lowndes reprinted some of 
them in his professional magazine, 
Science Fiction Stories.) And Larry 
Shaw, later editor of Infinity, and 
currently editing for Lancer Books, 
had a memorable and witty discus- 
sion of Lewis Caroll’s nonsense-epic. 
The Hunting of the Snark, in the 
terms of (of all things!) a mfirder

IF 




mystery, which was printed in Ron 
Smith’s fanzine, Inside. 

Scholarship has produced such 
jolly items as an exegesis of every 
single goldurn name in Robert E. 
Howard’s whole ‘Conan’ series — 
written by the deft and erudite Mr. 
L. Sprague de Camp — and serializ- 
ed in a fanzine called Amra. 

Some Recent Fanzines: Current & Choice 

N ot all fanzines are of perma- 
nent value, heaven help us; 
many if not most are sheerest ep- 
hemera. Let’s focus on a quick close- 
up of a couple of recent ones, to 
give an idea of the range of material, 
variety of relative value, and like 
that. 

Yandro is a good example of the 
“general” fanzine. You are likely to 
find a little of everything there. It 
won the “Hugo” — an award given 
annually at the World Science Fic- 
tion Convention, to best novel of the 
year, short story, artist, fan publica- 
tion, etc. This, Fandom’s “Oscar,” 
was handed to Yandro at 1965’s 
worldcon, which was held in Lon- 
don. Now, Yandro is mimeographed 
16 pages of 8^” x 11” yellow paper. 
It’s one of the oldest fanzines around, 
now in its 150th issue, and thirteenth 
year of publication. The editors are 
Buck and Juanita Coulson, Route 
#3, Hartford City, Ind., 47348. (30c 
an issue). Like most fanzines, Yan- 
dro has a small subscription list 
limited to a couple of hundred fans, 
but these few are scattered all over 
the world — a glance at the letter 
column reveals comments from read- 



ers in Sweden, Australia, England, 
Spain, Alabama, and other foreign 
countries. This issue, both the arti- 
cles and reviews, and the letters, 
contains comments about the Ku 
Klux Klan, Robert A. Heinlein, 
Peter Pan, the new paperback ver- 
sions of The Lord of the Rings, mo- 
vies, and so on. 

Then there’s Amra, a horse of a 
different color, as it were. Amra is 
published for fans of “sword & 
sorcery,” the sort of action fantasy 
Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert 
E. Howard wrote. The latest issue I 
have seen is Vol. 2 No. 34, published 
by George Scithers, Box 9120, Chi- 
cago, 111., 60690 ($2.00 for 8 is- 
sues.) Amra is smaller than Yandro, 
6%” X 9”, and printed by offset 
lithography, sometimes in color. This 
issue runs to 20 pages, which is about 
par for the course. Amra is the dar- 
ling of a lot of science-fiction au- 
thors, who contribute articles, book 
reviews, verse. L. Sprague de Camp 
reviews a new book by Harold 
Lamb, The Curved Saber; Frank 
Herbert tells how his novel. Dune, 
came to be; Katherine MacLean dis- 
cusses a book on Zen; there are 
seven gorgeous Roy Krenkel draw- 
ings. Amra also won a “Hugo” — 
the year before Yandro. 

S o much for our nostalgicky jaunt 
down Mem’ry Lane. Next time 
Our Man In Fandom will look at 
the wackiest of all fan phenomena 
— two amateur publishing clubs, one 
in New York, the other in Califor- 
nia — who publish 10 to 25 fan- 
zines every week! END

IF • N ovelette 



IN THE TEMPLE OF MARS 

by FRED SABERHAGEN 



Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



The ship drove through the 
starlaneSf carrying a crew 
of fanatics to their death! 



I 

S omething was driving waves of 
confusion ‘ through his mind, so 
that he knew not who he was, or 
where. How long ago what was hap- 
pening had started or what had 
gone before it he could not guess. 
Nor could he resist what was hap- 
pening, or even decide if he wanted 
to resist. 



A chant beat in his ears, growled 
out by barbaric voices: 

On the wall there was painted a 
forest 

In which there lived neither man 
nor beast 

With knotty f gnarled, barren 
trees, old . 

And he could see the forest around 



80 




IN THE TEMPLE OR MARS 



him. Whether the trees and the 
chanting voices were real or not 
was a question he could not even 
formulate. 

Through broken branches hideous 
to behold 

There ran a cold and sighing wind 

As if a storm would break down 
every bough 

And downward, at the bottom of 
a hill 

Stood the temple of Mars who is 
mighty in arms . 

And he saw the temple. It was of 
steel, curved in the dread shape of a 
berserker’s hull, and half-sunken in 
dark earth. At the entrance, gates 
of steel sang and shuddered in the 
cold wind rushing out, rushing out 
endlessly to rage through the shat- 
tered forest. The whole scene was 
gray, and lighted from above by an 
auroral flickering. 

The northern lights shone in at the 
doors 

For there was no window on the 
walls 

Through which men might see any 
light . 

He seemed to pass, with a con- 
queror’s strides, between the claw- 
like gates, toward the temple door. 

The door was of eternal adamant 

Bound lengthways and sideways 
with tough iron 

And to make the temple stronger, 
every pillar 

Was thick as a barrel of iron 
bright and shiny, 

62 



The inside of the temple was a 
kaleidoscope of violence, a frantic 
abattoir. Hordes of phantasmal men 
were moved down in scenes of war, 
women were slaughtered by ma- 
chines, children crushed and de- 
voured by animals. He, the con- 
queror, accepted it all, exulted in 
it all, even as he became aware that 
his mind, under some outer compul- 
sion, was building it all from the 
words of the chant. 

He could not tell how long it 
lasted, but the end came abruptly. 
The pressure on his mind was 
eased, and the chanting stopped. 
The relief was such that he fell 
sprawling onto a soft surface, his 
eyes closed. Except for his own 
breathing all was quiet. 

A gentle thud made him open his 
eyes. A short metal sword had 
been dropped or tossed from some- 
where to land near him. He was in 
a round, softly lighted, familiar 
room. The circular wall was covered 
by a continuous mural, depicting a 
thousand variations on the theme of 
bloody violence. At one side of the 
room, behind a low altar, towered 
the statue of an armed man who was 
larger than life and more than a 
man, his bronze face a mask of in- 
sensate rage. 

All this he had seen before, and 
he gave it little thought. Except for 
the sword. He was drawn to the 
sword like a steel particle to a mag- 
net, for the power of his recent vis- 
ion was still fresh and irresistible, 
and it was the power of destruction. 
He crawled to the sword, noticing 
dimly that he was dressed like the 



IF 




statue of the god, in a coat of mail. 
When he had the sword in his hand 
the power of it drew him to his feet. 
He looked round expectantly. 

A section of the continuous mural- 
wall opened into a door, and a fig- 
ure entered the temple. It was 
dressed in a neat, plain uniform, 
and its face was lean and severe. It 
looked like a man, but it was not a 
man, for no blood gushed out when 
the sword hewed in. 

Joyfully, thoughtlessly, he hacked 
the plastic-bodied figure into a dozen 
pieces. Then he stood swaying over 
it, drained and weary. The metal 
pommel of the sword grew sudden- 
ly hot in his hand, so that he had 
to drop it. All this had happened 
before, again and again. 

The painted door opened once 
more. This time it was a real man 
who entered, a man dressed in black, 
who had hypnotic eyes under bushy 
brows. “Tell me your name,” the 
black-uniform ordered. His voice 
compelled. 

“My name is Jor.” 

“And mine?” 

“You are Katsulos,” said Jor 
dully. “The Esteeler secret police.” 

“Yes. And where are we?” 

“In space, aboard the Nirvana II. 
We are takings the High Lord No- 
gara’s new space-going castle out to 
him, out to the rim of the galaxy. 
And when he comes aboard, I am 
supposed to entertain him by killing 
someone with a sword. Or another 
gladiator will entertain him by kill- 
ing me.” 

“Normal bitterness,” remarked 
one of Katsulo’s pien, appearing in 
the doorway behind him. 



“Yes, this one always snaps right 
back,” Katsulos said. “But a good 
subject. See the brain rhythms?” He 
showed the other a torn-off piece 
of a chart from some recording de- 
vice. 

They stood there discussing Jor 
like a specimen, while he waited and 
listened. They had taught Jor to be- 
have. They thought they had taught 
him permanently — ^but one -of these 
days he was going to show them. 
He shivered in his mail coat. 

‘Take him back to his cell,” Kat- 
sulos ordered at last. “I’ll be along 
in a moment.” 

Jor looked about him confusedly 
as he was led out of the temple and 
down some stairs. His recollection of 
the treatment he had just undergone 
was already becoming uncertain; and 
what he could remember was so un- 
pleasant that he made no effort to 
retain it. But his sullen determina- 
tion to strike back stayed with him. 

Left alone in the temple, Kat- 
sulos kicked the pieces of the plastic 
dummy into a pile, to be ready for 
careful salvage. He trod heavily on 
the malleable face, just in case some- 
one besides his own men should 
happen to see it. 

Then he stood for a moment look- 
ing up into the maniacal bronze face 
of Mars. And Katsulos* eyes, that 
were cold weapons when he turned 
them on other men, were now alive. 

U 

A communicator sounded, in what 
was going to be the High Lord 
Nogara’s cabin when he took deliv- 
ery of the ship. Admiral Hemphill, 



IN THE TEMPLE OR AAARS 



83 




alone in the cabin, needed a moment 
to find the proper switch on the huge, 
unfamiliar desk. “What is it?” 

“Sir, our rendevous with the Solar- 
ian courier is completed. We’re 
ready to drive again, unless you have 
any last minute messages to trans- 
mit?” 

“Negative. Our new passenger 
came aboard?” 

“Yes, sir. A Solarian, named 
Mitchell Spain. As we were advised.” 

“I know Mr. Spain, Captain. Will 
you ask him to come to this cabin as 
soon as possible? I’d like to talk 
to him at once.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Are those police still snooping 
around the bridge?” 

“Not at the moment, sir.” 

Hemphill shut off the communi- 
cator and leaned back in the throne- 
like chair from which Felipe Nogara 
would soon survey his Esteeler em- 
pire; but soon the habitually severe 
expression of Hemphill’s lean face 
deepened and he stood up. The lux- 
ury of this cabin did not please him. 

On the blouse of Hemphill’s neat, 
plain uniform were seven ribbons of 
scarlet and black, each representing 
a battle in which one or more ber- 
serker machines had been destroyed. 
He wore no other decorations except 
his insignia of rank. 

Within a. minute the cabin door 
opened, and a short, muscular, rath- 
er ugly man in civilian clothes en- 
tered. He smiled at once, and came 
toward the desk. 

“So, it’s High Admiral Hemphill 
now, with your commission from 
the United Planets. Congratulations. 
It’s a long time since we’ve met.” 



“Thank you. Yes, not since the 
Stone Place.” Hemphill’s mouth bent 
upward slightly at the corners, and 
he moved around the desk to shake 
hands. “You were a captain of ma- 
rines then, as I recall.” 

And they gripped hands, both men 
thought back to that day of victory 
against the machines. Neither of 
them could smile at it now, for the 
war was going badly again. 

“That’s nine years ago,” said 
Mitchell Spain. ”I’m a foreign cor- 
respondent now, for Solar News 
Service. They want me to go out 
and interview Nogara.” 

“I’ve heard that you’ve made a 
reputation as a writer.” Hemphill 
motioned Mitch to a chair. “I’m 
afraid I have no time myself for lit- 
erature or other non-essentials.” 
Mitch sat down, and dug out his 
pipe. He knew Hemphill well enough 
to be sure that no slur was intended 
by the reference to literature. To 
Hemphill, everything was non-essen- 
tial except the destruction of berserk- 
er machines; and today such a view- 
point was doubtless a good one for 
a High Admiral. 

Mitch got the impression that 
Hemphill, had serious business to 
talk about, but was uncertain of how 
to broach the subject. To fill the 
pause, Mitch remarked: “I wonder if 
the High Lord Nogara will be 
pleased with his new ship.” He ges- 
tured around the cabin with the stem 
of his pipe. 

Everything was quiet and steady 
as if rooted on the surface of a 
planet. There was nothing to suggest 
that even now the most powerful 
engines ever built by Earth^escend- 



84 



IF 




ed men were hurling this ship out 
toward the rim of the galaxy at many 
times the speed of light. 

Hemphill took the remark as a 
cue. Leaning slightly forward in his 
uncomfortable-looking seat, he said: 
“I’m not concerned about his liking 
it. What concerns me is how it’s go- 
ing to be used.” 

Since the Stone Place, Mitch’s left 
hand was mostly scar tissue and 
prosthetics. He used one plastic fin- 
ger now to tamp down the glowing 
coal of his pipe. “You mean No- 
gara’s idea of fun? I caught a glimpse 
of the gladiatorial arena. I’ve never 
met him, but they say he’s gone bad, 
really bad, since Karlsen’s death.” 

“I wasn’t talking about Nogara’s 
so-called amusements. What I really 
mean is that Karlsen may be still 
alive.” 

H emphill’s calm, fantastic state- 
ment hung in the quiet cabin 
air. For a moment it seemed to 
Mitch that he could sense the mo- 
tion of the C-plus ship as it traversed 
spaces no man understood, spaces 
where it seemed time might mean 
nothing and the dead of all the ages 
might still be walking. 

Mitch shook his head. “Are we 
talking about the same man? Johann 
Karlsen, Nogara’s half-brother?” 
“Of course.” 

“Wait a minute. Two years ago 
Johann Karlsen went down into a 
hypermassive sun, with a berserker- 
controlled ship on his tail. Unless 
that story’s not true?” 

“It’s perfectly true, except we 
think now that his launch went into 
orbit around the hypermass instead 



of falling into it. Have you seen the 
girl who’s aboard?” 

“I passed a girl, outside your 
cabin. I thought . .” 

“No, I have no time for that. Her 
name is Lucinda, single names are 
the custom on her planet. She’s an 
eyewitness to Karlsen’s vanishing.” 
“Oh. Yes, I remember the story. 
But what’s this about his being in 
orbit?” 

Hemphill stood up and seemed to 
become more comfortable, as an- 
other man would by sitting down. 
“Ordinarily, the hypsermass and ev- 
erything near it is invisible, due to 
the extreme red shift caused by its 
gravity. But during the last year 
some scientists have done their best 
to study it. Their ship didn’t com- 
pare with this one — ” Hemphill 
turned his head for a moment, as if 
he could hear the mighty engines — 
“but they went as close as they dared, 
carrying new long-wave telescopes. 
The star itself was still invisible, but' 
they brought back these.” 

Hemphill picked up an envelope 
and shook out photographs, which 
Mitch spread on the desk. Most of 
them showed patterns of slightly 
curving parallel lines, dark against 
a sullen red background. 

Hemphill stood behind him. 
“That’s what space looks like near 
the hypermass. Remember, it has 
about a billion times the mass of 
Sol, packed into ronghly the same 
volume. Gravity like that does things 
we don’t yet understand.” 

“Interesting. What forms these 
dark lines?” 

“Falling dust that’s become trap- 
ped in lines of gravitic force, like 



IN THE TEMPLE OR MARS 



85 




the lines round a magnet. Or so I’m 
told.” 

‘‘And where’s Kai^lsen?” 
Hemphill’s finger descended on a 
photo, pointing out a spot of crystal- 
line roundness, tiny as a raindrop 
within a magnified line of dust. “We 
think this is his launch. It’s orbiting 
about a hundred million miles from 
the center of the hypermass. And the 
berserker-controlled ship that was 
chasing him is here, following him 
in the same dust-line.” His finger 
moved to another photo, to point 
out a dark-shape. “Now they’re both 
stuck. No ordinary engines can 
drive a ship down there.” 

Mitch stared at the photos, hard- 
ly seeing them for the old memories 
that came flooding back. “And you 
think he’s alive.” 

“He had equipment that would let 
him freeze himself into suspended 
animation. Also, time may be run- 
ning quite slowly for him. He’s in a 
three-hour orbit.” 

“A three-hour orbit, at a hundred 
million miles — wait a minute!” 
Hemphill almost smiled. “I told 
you, things we don’t understand 
yet.” 

M itch nodded slowly. “He’s not a 
man to give up. No. He’d fight 
as long as he could, and then invent 
a way to -fight some more.” 

Hemphill’s face had become iron 
again. “You know how many people 
have made a god of him since his 
departure, and what a boost to their 
morale his return would be. And you 
knew him. You saw what efforts the 
berserkers made to kill him. They 
feared him, in their iron guts, though 



I never quite understood why . 
Do you agree, then? If we can save 
him we must do so at once — ^with- 
out delay.” 

“Certainly, but how?” 

“With this ship. It has the strong- 
est engines ever built — trust Nogara 
to have seen to that, with his own 
safety in mind.” 

Mitch whistled softly. “Strong 
enough to match orbits with Karl- 
sen and pull him out of there?” 
“Yes, mathematically. Supposed- 
ly.” 

“And you mean to make the at- 
tempt before this ship is delivered 
to Nogara.” 

“That’s it. I’ve been keeping my 
rescue plan a secret; you know he 
wanted Karlsen out of the way.” 
Mitch nodded. He felt a rising ex- 
citement. “And if we succeed No- 
gara may rage, but what can he do? 
How about the crew, are they will- 
ing?” 

“I’ve already sounded out the cap- 
tain. He’s with me. And since I hold 
my rank from the United Blanets I 
can issue legal orders on any ship.” 
Hemphill began to pace. “The only 
thing that worries me is this de- 
tachment of Nogara’s police we have 
aboard; they’re certain to oppose the 
rescue.” 

“How many of them are there?” 
“A couple of dozen. I don’t know 
why there are so many, but they out- 
number the rest of us two to one. 
Not counting their prisoners, who 
of course are helpless.” 

“Prisoners?” 

“About forty young men, I un- 
derstand. Sword fodder for the 
arena.”

L ucinda spent a good deal of her 
time wandering restless and 
alone through the corridors of the 
great ship. Today she happened to be 
in a passage not far from the central 
bridge and flag quarters when a door 
opened close ahead of her and three 
men came into view. The two who 
wore black uniforms held a single 
prisoner, clad in a shirt of chain 
mail, between them. 

When she saw the black uniforms, 
Lucinda’s chin lifted. She waited, 
standing in their path. 

“Go round me, vultures,” she said 
in an icy voice when they came up 
to her. She did not look at the pris- 
oner; bitter experience had taught 
her that showing sympathy for No- 
gara’s victims could bring added suf- 
fering upon them. 

The black uniforms halted in front 
of her. “I am Katsulos,” said the 
bushy-browed one. “Who are you?” 
“Once my planet was Flamland,” 
she said, and from the corner of her 
eye she saw the prisoner’s face turn 
up. “One day it will be my home 
again, when it is freed of Nogara’s 
vultures.” 

The second black uniform opened 
his mouth to reply, but never got out 
a word, for just then the prisoner’s 
elbow came smashing back into his 
belly. Then the prisoner, who till 
now had stood meek as a lamb, 
shoved Katsulos off his feet and was 
out of sight around a bend of cor- 
ridor before either policemen could 
recover. 

Katsulos bounced quickly to his 
feet. His gun drawn, he pushed past 



Lucinda to the bend of the corridor. 
Then she saw his shoulders slump. 

Her delighted laughter did not 
seem to sting him in the least. 

“There’s nowhere he can go,” he 
said. The look in his eyes choked off 
her laughter in her throat. 

K atsulos posted police guards on 
the bridge and in the engine 
room, and secured all lifeboats. “The 
man Jor is desperate, and danger- 
ous,” he explained to Hemphill and 
to Mitchell Spain. “Half of my men 
are searching for him continuously, 
but you know how big this ship is. I 
hope you will stay close to your 
quarters until he’s caught.” 

A day passed, and Jor was not 
caught. Mitch took advantage of the 
police dispersal to investigate the 
arena — Solar News would be much 
interested. 

He climbed a short stair and em- 
erged squinting in imitation sunlight, 
under a high-domed ceiling as blue 
as Earth’s sky. He found himself be- 
hind the upper row of the approxi- 
mately two hundred seats that en- 
circled the arena behind a sloping 
crystalline wall. At the bottom of 
the glassy bowl, the oval-shaped 
fighting area was about thirty yards 
long. It was floored by a substance 
that looked like sand but was doubt- 
less something more cohesive, that 
would not fly up in a cloud if the 
artificial gravity chanced to fail. 

In this facility, as slickly modern 
as a death-ray, the vices of ancient 
Rome could be enjoyed most effi- 
ciently. Every spectator would be 
able to see every drop of blood. 
There was only one awkward-looking 



IN THE TEMPLE OR MARS

feature. Set at equal intervals around 
the upper rim of the arena, behind 
the seats, were three buildings, each 
as large as a small house. Their arch- 
itecture seemed to Mitch to belong 
somewhere on Ancient Earth; their 
purpose was not immediately appar- 
ent. 

Mitch took out his pocket camera 
and made a few photographs from 
where he stood. Then he walked 
behind the rows of seats to one of 
the buildings. A door stood open, 
and he went in. At first he thought 
he had discovered an entrance to 
Nogara’s private harem; but after 
a moment he saw that the people in 
the paintings were not all engaged in 
sexual embraces. There were men 
and women and godlike beings, 
posed in a variety of relationships, 
in the costumes of Ancient Earth 
when they wore any costumes at all. 
As Mitch snapped a few more 
photos he gradually realized that 
each of the paintings was meant to 
depict some aspect of human love. 

It was puzzling. He had not ex- 
pected to find love here, or in any 
part of Felipe Nogara’s chosen en- 
vironment. 

As he left the temple through an- 
other door, he passed a lady who was 
evidently the resident goddess. vShe 
was bronze, and the upper part of 
her beautiful body emerged nude 
from glittering sea-green waves. He 
photographed the smiling statue and 
moved on. 

The second building’s interior 
paintings showed scenes of hunting, 
and of women in childbirth. The 
goddess of this temple was clothed 
modestly in bright green and armed 



with a bow and quiver. Bronze 
hounds waited at her feet, eager for 
the chase. 

As he moved on to the last 
temple, Mitch found his steps quick- 
ening slightly. Could something be 
drawing him there? 

Whatever attraction might have 
existed was annihilated in revulsion 
as soon as he stepped into the place. 
If the first building was a temple 
raised to Love, surely this one hon- 
ored Hate. 

On the painted wall fight opposite 
the entrance, a sow-like beast thrust 
its ugly head into a cradle, devour- 
ing the screaming child. Beside it, 
men in togas, faces glowing with 
hate, stabbed one of their own num- 
ber to death. All around the walls 
men and women and children suf- 
fered pointlessly and died horribly, 
without hope. Tlie spirit of destruc- 
tion was almost palpable within this 
room. It was like a berserker’s — 

Mitch took a step back and closed 
his eyes, bracing his arms against 
the sides of the entrance. Yes, some- 
thing more than clever painting and 
lighting had been set to work here, 
to honor Hate. It was something 
physical, that Mitch found not en- 
tirely unfamiliar. 

Years ago, during a space battle, 
he had experienced the attack of a 
berserker’s mindbeam, a weapon de- 
signed to throw organized thought 
into confusion. Men had learned how 
to shield their ships from mind- 
beams. 

Did they now bring the enemy’s 
weapons inside? 

Mitch opened his eyes. The beam 
he felt now was very weak, but it 



IF 




carried something worse than mere 
confusion. 

M itch stepped back and forth 
through the entrance. Outside 
the walls of the temple, the effect 
practically disappeared. Inside, it was 
perceptible, an energy that pricked 
at the rage centers of the brain. 
Slowly, slowly, it seemed to be fad- 
ing, like a residual discharge from a 
machine that has been turned off. 
If it was turned off, and he could 
feel it now, what must this temple 
be like when the projector was on? 

More importantly, why was such 
a thing here at all, built into these 
walls? Was it meant only to goad a 
few gladiators on to livelier deaths? 
Possibly. Mitch glanced at this 
temple’s towering bronze god, riding 
his chariot over the world, and shiv- 
ered. He suspected something worse 
than the simple brutality of Roman 
games. Yes, worse. 

He remembered seeing an inter- 
com station near the first temple he 
had entered. He walked back there, 
and thoughtfully punched out the 
number of Ship’s Records on the 
intercom keys. 

When the automated voice an- 
swered, he ordered: “I want some 
information about the design of this 
arena, particularly the three struc- 
tures spaced around the upper rim.” 
The voice asked him if he wanted 
diagrams. 

“No. At least not yet. Just tell me 
what you can about the designer’s 
basic purpose.” 

There was a delay of several sec- 
onds. Then the voice said: “The 
basic designer was a man named 



Oliver Mical, since deceased. In his 
design programming, frequent ref- 
erence is made to descriptive pas- 
sages within a literary work by one 
Geoffrey Chaucer of Ancient Earth. 
The quote fantastic unquote work is 
titled The Knight's Tale." 

The name of Chaucer rang only 
the faintest of bells for Mitch. But 
he remembered that Oliver Mical 
had been one of Nogara’s brain- 
washing experts, and also a classical 
scholar. 

“What kind of psycho-electronic 
devices are built into these three 
structures?” 

“There is no record aboard of any 
such installation.” 

Mitch Was sure about the hate- 
projector in the temple; it might have 
been built in secretly. It probably 
had been, if his worst suspicions 
were true. 

He ordered: “Read me some of 
the relevant passages of this literary 
work.” 

“The three temples are those of 
Mars, Venus and Diana,” said the 
intercom. “A passage relevant to 
the temple of Mars follows, in orig- 
inal language: 

“First on the wal was peynted a 
forest 

In which there dwelleth neither 
man ne beast 

With knotty, knarry, barreyn trees 
olde 

Of stubbes sharp and hideous to 
biholde.” 

Mitch could understand only a 
word here and there, but he was not 
really listening now. The words 
“temple of Mars” had been enough 
to convince him of the worst; for he 



IN THE TEMPLE OR MARS 



89 




had heard that phrase applied to a 
newly risen secret cult of berserker- 
worshippers. 

“And downward from a hill, 
under a bente 

Ther stood the temple of Mars 
armipotente 

Wrought of burned steal, of which 
the entree 

Was long and streit, and gastly 
for to see.” 

T here was a soft sound behind 
Mitch, and he turned quickly. 
Katsulos stood there. He was smil- 
ing, but his eyes reminded Mitch of 
Mars’ statue. 

“Do you understand the ancient 
language, Spain? No? Then I shall 
translate.” He took up the verse in 
a chanting voice: 

“Then saw I first the dark imag- 
ining 

Of felony, and all its compassing 
The cruel ire, red as any fire 
The pickpurse, and also the pale 
dread 

The smiler with the knife under 
his cloak 

The stable burning with the black 
smoke 

The treason of the murdering in 
the bed 

The open war, with all the wounds 
that bled . .” 

“Who are you, really?” Mitch de- 
manded. He wanted it out in the 
opep. And he wanted to gain time, 
for Katsulos wore a pistol at his 
belt. “What is this to you? Some 
kind of religion?” 

“Not some religion!” Katsulos 
shook his head, while his eyes glowed 
steadily at Mitch. “Not a mythol- 



ogy of distant gods, nor a system of 
pale ethics for dusty philosophers. 
No!” He took a step closer. “Spain, 
there is no time now for me to 
proselytize with craft and subtlety. 
I say only this — the temple of Mars 
stands open to you! The new god of 
all creation will accept your sacrifice 
and your love.” 

“You pray to that bronze statue?” 
Mitch tensed, getting ready. 

“No, the Mars of the ancients is 
not our god!” The fanatic’s words 
poured out faster and louder, “The 
myth with helmet and sword is our 
symbol and no more. Our god is 
new, and real, and worthy. He wields 
death-beam and missile, and his glory 
is as the nova sun. He is the descen- 
dant of Life and feeds on Life 
as is his right. And we who give 
ourselves to any of his units become 
immortal in him though our flesh 
perishes at his touch.” 

“I’ve heard there were men who 
prayed to berserkers,” said Mitch. 
“Somehow I never expected to meet 
one.” Faintly in the distance he 
heard a man shouting, and feet 
pounding down a corridor. Sudden- 
ly he wondered if he or Katsulos was 
more likely to receive reinforcement. 

“Soon we will be everywhere,” 
said Katsulos loudly. “We are here 
now, and we are seizing this ship. We 
will take it out to save the unit of 
our god orbiting the hypermass. And 
there we will give the badlife Karl- 
sen to Mars, and we will give our- 
selves, and this great ship. And 
through Mars we will live forever!” 

He looked into Mitch’s face and 
started to draw his gun, just as Mitch 
hurled himself forward.

IF 




Katsulos tried to spin away as 
Mitch reached him. Mitch failed to 
get a solid grip, and both men fell 
sprawling, a few feet apart. Mitch 
saw the gun muzzle swing round on 
him, and dived desperately for shel- 
ter behind a row of seats. Splinters 
flew around him as the gun blasted. 
In an instant he was moving again, 
in a crouching run that carried him 
into the temple of Venus by one door 
and out by another. Before Katsulos 
could sight at him for another shot 
Mitch had leaped down an exit stair- 
way. 

As he emerged into a corridor, he 
heard gunfire from the direction of 
the crew’s quarters. He went the 
other way, heading for Hemphill’s 
cabin. At a turn in the passage a 
black uniform stepped out to bar 
his way, aiming a pistol, Mitch 
charged without hesitation, taking 
the policeman by surprise. The gun 
fired even as he knocked it aside, 
and then his rush bowled the black 
uniform over. Mitch sat on him and 
clobbered him with fists and elbows 
until he was quiet. 

Then, captured gun in hand, 
Mitch hurried on to Hemphill’s door. 
It slid open before he could pound 
on it, and closed again as soon as he 
jumped inside. 

A dead black-uniform sat leaning 
against the wall, unseeing eyes aimed 
at Mitch, bullet-holes patterned 
across his chest. 

“Welcome,” said Hemphill drily. 
He stood with his left hand on an 
elaborate control console that had 
been raised from a place of conceal- 
ment inside the huge desk. In his 
right hand a machine pistol hung 



casually. “It seems we face greater 
difficulties than we expected.” 

IV 

L ucinda sat in the darkened cabin 
that was Jor’s hiding place, 
watching him eat. Immediately after 
his escape she had started roaming 
the ship’s passages, looking for him, 
whispering his name, until at last 
he had seen her and had answered. 

Since then she had been smug- 
gling food and drink to him. 

He was no mere boy, as she had 
thought at first glance. He was a 
man of about her own age, with 
tiny lines at the corners of his sus- 
picious eyes. Paradoxically, the more 
she helped him, the more suspicious 
his eyes became. 

Now he paused in his eating to 
ask: “What do you plan to do when 
we reach Nogara, and a hundred 
of his men come aboard to search 
for me? They’ll soon find me then.” 
She wanted to tell him about 
Hemphill’s plan for rescuing Karl- 
sen. Once Johann Karlsen was 
aboard, no one on this ship would 
have to fear Nogara. Or so she felt. 
But just because Jor still seemed 
suspicious of her, she hesitated to 
trust him with a secret. 

“You knew you’d be caught even- 
tually,” she countered. “So why did 
you run away?” 

“You don’t know what it’s like, 
being their prisoner.” 

“I do know.” 

He ignored her contradiction. 
“They trained me with the others, 
to fight in the arena. And then they 
singled me out, and began to train 



IN THE TEMPLE OR MARS 



91 




me for something even worse. Now 
they flick a switch somewhere, and 
I start to kill, like a berserker.” 

“What do you mean?” 

He closed his eyes, his food for- 
gotten. “I think there’s a man they 
want me to assassinate. Every day 
or so they put me in the temple of 
Mars and drive me mad, and then 
the image of this man is always sent 
to me. Always it’s the same face 
and uniform. And I must destroy 
the image, with a sword or a gun 
or with my hands. I have no choice 
when they flip that switch, no con- 
trol over myself. They’ve hollowed 
me out and then filled me up again 
with their own madness. They’re 
madmen. I think they go into the 
temple themselves and turn the foul 
madness on, and wallow in it before 
their idol.” 

He had never said so much to 
her in one speech before. She was 
not sure how much of it was true, 
but she felt he believed it all, and 
she reached for his hand. 

“Jor, I do know something about 
them. That’s why I’ve helped you. 
And I’ve seen other men who were 
really brainwashed. They haven’t 
really destroyed you, you’ll be all 
right again some day.” 

“They want me to look normal.” 
He opened his eyes, which were still 
suspicious. “Why are you on this 
ship, anyway?” 

“Because.” She looked into the 
past. “Two years ago I met a man 
called Johann Karlsen. Yes, the one 
everyone knows of. I spent about 
ten minutes with him, before he — 
disappeared.” She sighed. “If he’s 
still alive, he’s certainly forgotten 



about me. But I fell in love with 
him.” 

“In love!” Jor snorted, and began 
to pick his teeth. 

Or I thought I fell in love with 
him, she said to herself. Watching 
Jor now, understanding and forgiv- 
ing his sullen mistrust, she realized 
that she was no longer able to visu- 
alize Karlsen’s face clearly. 

Something triggered Jor’s taut 
nerves, and he jumped up tp peek 
out of the cabin into the passage. 
“What’s that noise? Hear? It sounds 
like fighting.” 

44O0.” Hemphill’s voice was grim- 

O mer than usual. The surviv- 
ing crewmen are barricaded in their 
quarters, surrounded and under at- 
tack. The damned berserker-lovers 
hold the bridge, and the engine room. 
In fact they hold the ship, except for 
this.” He patted the console that he 
had raised from its concealment in- 
side Nogara’s innocent-looking desk. 
“I know Felipe Nogara, and I 
thought he’d have a master control 
in his cabin, and I thought we might 
possibly need it. That’s why I had 
myself quartered in here.” 

“What all does it control?” Mitch 
asked, wiping his hands. He had just 
dragged the dead man into a closet. 
Katsulos should have known better 
than to send only one against the 
High Admiral. 

“I believe it will override any con- 
trol on the bridge or in the engine 
room. With it I can open or close 
most of the doors and hatches on 
the ship. And there seem to be 
scanners hidden in a hundred places, 
connected to this little viewscreen. 



92 



IF 





IN THE TEMPLE OR MARS 



The berserker-lovers aren’t going 
anywhere with this ship until they’ve 
done a lot of rewiring, or gotten us 
out of this cabin.” 

“I don’t suppose we’re going any- 
where either,” said Mitch. “Have 
you any idea what’s happened to 
Lucy?” 

“No. She and that man Jor may 
be free. And they may do us some 
good, but we can’t count on it. Spain, 
look here.” Hemphill pointed to the 
little screen. “This is a view inside 
the guardroom and prison, under 
the arena’s seats. If all those individ- 
ual cells are occupied, there must be 
about forty men in there.” 

“That’s an idea. They may be 
trained fighters, and they’ll certainly 
have no love for the black uni- 
forms.” 

“I could talk to them from here,” 
Hemphill mused. “But how can we 
free them and arm them? I can’t 
control their individual cell doors, 
though I can keep the enemy locked 
out of that area, at least for a while. 
Tell me, how did the fighting start? 
What set it off?” 

Mitch told Hemphill what he 
knew. “It’s almost funny. The cult- 
ists have the same idea you have, of 
taking the ship out to the hypermass 
and going after Karlsen. Only of 
course they want to give him to the 
berserker machine.” He shook his 
head. “I suppose Katsulos hand- 
picked cultists from among the po- 
lice for this mission. There must be 
more of them around than any of 
us thought.” 

Hemphill only shrugged. Maybe 
he understood fairly well those fana- 
tics out there whose polarity hap- 



pened to be opposite from his own. 

L ucinda would not leave Jor now, 
nor let him leave her. Like 
hunted animals they made their way 
through the corridors, which she 
knew well from her days of restless 
walking. She guided him around the 
sounds of fighting, to where he want- 
ed to go. 

He peered around the last corner, 
and brought his head back to whis- 
per: “There’s no one at the guard- 
room door.” 

“But how will you get in? And 
some of the vultures may be inside, 
and you’re not armed.” 

He laughed soundlessly. “What 
have I to lose? My life?'* He moved 
on around the corner. 

Mitch’s fingers suddenly dug into 
Hemphill’s arm. “Look! Tor’s there, 
with the same idea you had. Open 
the door for him, quick!” 

In the temple of Mars, most of 
the painted panels had been remov- 
ed from the interior walls. Two 
black-uniformed men were at work 
on the mechanism thus revealed, 
while Katsulos sat in the center, 
watching Tor’s progress through his 
own secret scanners. When he saw 
Jor and Lucinda being let into the 
guardroom, Katsulos pounced. 

“Quick, turn on the beam and 
focus on him! Boil his brains with 
it. He’ll kill everyone in there, and 
then we can take our time with the 
others.” 

His two assistants hurried to obey. 
They arranged cables and a direc- 
tional antenna. One asked: “He’s the 



94 



IF 




one you were training to assassinate 
Hemphill?” 

“Yes, his brain rhythms are on the 
chart. Focus on him quickly!” 

“Set them free and arm them!” 
Hemphill’s image shouted, from a 
guardroom viewscreen. “You men 
there! Fight with us and I promise 
to take you to freedom when the 
ship is ours. And I promise to take 
Johann Karlsen with us, if he’s 
alive.” 

There was a roar from the cells 
at the offer of freedom, and another 
roar at Karlsen’s name. “With him, 
we’d go on to Esteel itself!” one 
prisoner shouted. 

When the beam from the temple 
of Mars struck downward, it went 
unfelt by everyone but Jor. The 
others in the guardroom had not 
been conditioned by repeated treat- 
ments, and the heat of their emo- 
tions was already high. 

But the beam hit Tor’s sensitized 
brain with overwhelming force, just 
as he picked up the key that would 
open the cells. In a paroxysm of 
rage he dropped the keys, and grab- 
bed an automatic weapon from the 
arms rack. The first burst he fired 
shattered Hemphill’s image from the 
viewscreeit. With the fragment of his 
mind that was still his own, he felt 
despair like that of a drowning man. 
He knew he was not going to be able 
to resist what was coming next. 

When Jor fired at the viewscreen, 
Lucinda understood what was being 
done to him. 

“Jor, no!” She fell to her knees 
before him. The face of Mars look- 
ed down at her, frightening beyond 



anything she had ever seen. “Jor, 
stop it! I love you!” 

Mars laughed at her love, or tried 
to laugh. But Mars could not quite 
manage to point the weapon at her, 
for Jor was trying to come back 
into his own face again, now com- 
ing back halfway, strugghng terribly. 

“And you love me, Jor, I can see 
it. Even if they force you to kill me, 
remember that I know that.” 

Jor felt a healing power, opposing 
the power of Mars. To his mind 
came the pictures he had once 
glimpsed in the temple of Venus. Of 
course, there must be a coimtering 
projector built in up there, and some- 
one had managed to turn it on. 

He came above his red rage like 
a swimmer surfacing, lungs burst- 
ing, from a drowning sea. He looked 
down at the gun in his hands. With 
a great effort of will he forced his 
fingers to begin opening. Mars still 
shouted at him, louder and louder, 
but Venus’ power grew stronger still. 
His hands opened and the weapon 
clattered on the floor. 

O nce the gladiators had been freed 
and armed, the fight was soon 
over, though not one of the cultists 
tried to surrender. Katsulos and the 
two with him fought to the last from 
inside the temple of Mars, with the 
hate projector turned up to maxi- 
mum power, and the recorder, chant- 
ing voices roaring out their song. 
Perhaps Katsulos still hoped to force 
his enemies into acts of self-destruc- 
tive rage. Or perhaps he had the 
projector on as an act of worship. 

Whatever his reasons, the three 
inside the temple absorbed the full 



IN THE TEMPLE OF MARS

effect themselves. Mitch had seen 
bad things before, but when he at 
last broke open the temple door, he 
had to turn away for a moment. 

Hemphill showed only satisfaction 
at seeing how the worship of Mars 
had culminated aboard Nirvana II. 
“Let’s see to the bridge and engine 
room first. Then we can get this 
mess cleaned up and be on our way.” 
Mitch was glad to follow, but he 
was detained for a moment by Jor. 

“Was it you who managed to turn 
on the counter-projector? If it was, 
I owe you much more than my life.” 
Mitch stared at him blankly. 
“Counter-projector? What’re you 
talking about?” 

“But there must have been . .” 
When the others had hurried away, 
Jor remained in the arena for a few 
moments, looking in awe at the thin 
walls of the temple of Venus, where 
no mindbeam projector could be 



hidden. Then a girl’s voice called, 
and Jor too hurried out. 

There was silence in the arena. 

“Emergency condition concluded,” 
said the voice of the intercom sta- 
tion, to the rows of empty seats. 
“Ship’s Records returning to normal

We was warned not to beHeve

A t supper Tommy Wilson casual-

Amy Wilson corrected her little

“Oh, it wasn’t saying prayers,” 
Tommy insisted. “We just had a 
talk — almost until supper time. 
And He said He couldn’t come 
home to supper with me because 
He had to meet some friends.” 

The senior Wilsons exchanged 
glances and let the topic die. They 
had developed a certain immunity 
to surprise over the few years since 
Tommy’s birth, for he was a pre- 
cocious little fellow, given to long 
moody silences and unexpected ex- 



cursions of the mind. However, 
while the evening bath ritual pro- 
gressed Tommy looked up from an 
intense concentration upon sailing 
his plastic boats and remarked, 
“God looks just like an astro- 
naut.” 

“That‘s very nice,” commented 
Amy Wilson, “but we must be care- 
ful to know which things are true 
and which are the sort we play 
make-believe games with.” 

“Oh, this is a true one,” Tommy 
answered. 

She said, “Remember how we tell 
the difference between the real 
things and the pretend kind? Could 
you see this astronaut when you 
had your eyes closed?” 

Tommy mumbled, “No.” Then he 
chortled triumphantly. “That makes 



97 



Him true, because you can still see 
the make-believe ones with your 
eyes closed.” 

Patiently, and slightly worried, 
Amy continued the test. “Could you 
touch this person? Could you feel 
it in your fingers when you did?” 
“Oh, yes.” Tommy giggled at 
some memory. “He held my hand 
when we went exploring in the park, 
and it made funny tickles go all 
through me.” 

Amy called her husband. 

“All right. Tommy,” Ben assum- 
ed the interrogation, “we’ve got 
some problems here that we need 
to understand. Now you pay atten- 
tion and think a long time before 
you answer me, because it could be 
very bad if you don’t. You met a 
man today and went exploring with 
him?” 

“It wasn’t a man,” insisted Tom- 
my. “It was God.” 

“But he looked like an astro- 
naut — helmet and everything?” 
“He didn’t have the helmet on. 
He was carrying it.” 

“Tell Daddy the real truth, Tom- 
my,” his mother admonished with 
sweet firmness. “You and the little 
Beckwith boy, who got that astro- 
naut suit last Christmas, went down 
by the river, and you’re afraid to 
admit it because you feel you will 
be spanked.” 

“Oh, no!” Tommy shook his head 
violently. “It wasn’t Jerry; it was 
God,” 

Ben took over again. “But ne 
looked like Jerry Beckwith — 
watching Tommy’s stubbornly shak- 
ing head — “then like another little 
boy — or girl about your size.” 



“He was bigger,” Tommy stated 
firmly. ‘Tall as the ceiling.” 

“You let a complete stranger per- 
suade you to go through the woods 
to the river and . .?” 

Tommy heard his mother give a 
sort of moan. “Tommy! Tommy!” 
she cried. “Don’t you remember? 
You are never to allow anyone you 
don’t know take you anywhere. Al- 
ways run and call for help when 
somebody like that talks to you.” 
“But I did know Him, Mommy. 
It was God — and you told me 
God was all right.” 

“How could you be certain this 
stranger was God, son?” Ben tried 
to control his voice. 

“He was ’way tall, and there was 
a funny shining in His face.” Tom- 
my yawned. “And He came out of 
the sky.” 

Tommy’s father forced himself to 
sound cheerful and said, “I’ll tell 
you what, son: you just go to sleep 
now and forget all about it. Then 
tomorrow we’ll go to the zoo. How 
about that?” 

“Okay.” 

Ben signaled his wife and they 
started to tip-toe from the room. 
Tommy murmured between prodi- 
gious yawns, “That’s what God told 
me too.” 

“What did he tell you, dear?” 
Aniy prompted softly. 

“He told me to forget all about 
talking to Him. Only he said it fun- 
ny, like this: ‘Forget, Tommy; for- 
get, Tommy’ — a long time, and 
His eyes got bigger.” Tommy swal- 
lowed half the room in a wide yawn 
and popped off to dreamland, as 
healthy little boys sometimes do.

B en looked at his wife and saw 
she was near hysteria. 

“Fve been trying to tell you, and 
you won’t listen to me,” she repeat- 
ed almost incoherently. “His mind 
is running out of control. He’s los- 
ing the power to distinguish between 
those imaginative worlds he builds 
constantly and what is real.” 

“Now whose imagination’s getting 
out of bounds?” Ben patted his wife 
and roughed her hair. “There’s 
bound to be a bit of basic truth 
under what the kid’s saying. Some 
stranger must have won his con- 
fidence, and Tommy has magnified 
the event because his conscience told 
him this was a thing we’d warned 
him against. If you can hold on to 
yourself and stop crying for a while 
ril take a walk down our block and 
ask neighbors if any of them noticed 
a stranger hanging around today.” 
She whirled away and faced Ben 
stubbornly. “We’re going to have a 
psychiatrist! You won’t stop me this 
time. We’re losing our child, Ben — 
to a world that doesn’t exist.” 

He shrugged, resigned. “If it wiM 
keep you happy.” 

“Then let’s do it now,” Amy said 
urgently. “Jerry Beckwith’s father 
— you can talk to him tonight.” 
“Ought we let neighbors know 
about this? People think there’s 
something odd about a family when 
one of them needs a psychiatrist.” 
“I don’t care what anybody 
thinks,” Amy cried out. “It doesn’t 
matter whether George Beckwith is 
a neighbor or not. He’s supposed to 
be the best psychiatrist in town. Ben, 
don’t put this thing off. Go right 
now!” 



“All right, gal. But don’t fly into 
pieces before I have time to cross the 
lawn.” Ben stalked out the front 
door, muttering unhappily to him- 
self. 

When he returned with Doctor 
l^kwith across the dew spattered 
grass Ben found Amy waiting out- 
side. “He’s awake again,” she called. 
“He’s got a long story about this 
afternoon.” 

“Think you might have trouble 
figuring whether it’s the mother or 
her son who needs you?” Ben re- 
alized suddenly that his attempt at 
humor sounded more like a rueful 
complaint. 

However, Beckwith chuckled. 
“We’ll have a chat with Tommy 
first.” He patted Amy’s shoulder. 
“I’ll bet you’re ready to join the club 
with Martha and me to agitate for 
having it made a law that kids get 
born after they are thirty years old.” 
They found Tommy sitting in the 
middle of his bed, bubbling with 
excited appreciation of the scene he 
was creating. “Now, Tommy, tell 
Doctor Beckwith what you just said 
to me,” Amy coaxed. “ever>^ing — 
how the man came, where he . 

“It was not a man,” Tommy in- 
sisited vehemently. “It was God.” 
George Beckwith puHed a chair 
up and sat directly in front of the 
boy. “We’ll agree it must have been 
God so you won’t be afraid your 
parents will punish you for talking 
to a stranger. How about that, son?” 
Tommy muttered, “Okay.” 

“So why don’t you tdl me the 
whole story of your adventure?” 
Hesitating and somewhat wor- 
ried, Tommy looked sideways at his 



THE PRETEND KIND

father, but he warmed up and for- 
got to be wary as excitement of his 
narration grew. “I was playing in 
the park 

“Our park? Across the street?” 
Ben asked sharply, and became silent 
at a warning gesture from Beckwith. 

“’Way down at the other end,” 
admitted Tommy reluctantly, and his 
father spoke quickly, “That’s all 
right this time, son. Go on.” 

“There was a dead turtle down 
by the river, and millions of ants 
walking inside his house. The police- 
miain told me about it; that’s why I 
went,” he finished defensively. 

Amy whispered iin the boy’s ear, 
“Daddy doesn’t mind.” 

“That was when God came down 
out of the sky, and He watched the 
ants with me. I remembered what 
Daddy told me about ants, and so 
I scraped a big piece of their trail 
away so He could see how funny 
ants behaved when they got lost and 
sitarted running around in circles. 

“And God said, ‘Does your father 
like to show you how to make things 
lose their way and be afraid?’ And 
I told Him Daddy wants me to know 
all about animals and bugs. God was 
very interested in you, Daddy, and 
how you helped me find birds’ eggs 
for my collection. He wanted to 
know why we stole eggs from the 
birds, and I told Him how we put 
them in a*box so we could look at 
them and show them to other people 
when Mommy had a big party. And 
He said, ‘Is everybody Mke your 
Daddy?’ And I said, ‘Oh, yes.’” 

T ommy leaned toward the doctor. 
“I t<kd God about all the horns 



you hang in your den that you took 
away from the deer when you killed 
them — and the big stuffed fish, and 
about how Miss Dorsey has a jar 
of poison that we can’t touch at 
school, and we bring bugs we find 
and she puts them in the jar until 
they’re dead, and we stick them on 
pins and keep them on a shelf where 
everybody can look at them. 

“And God said, ‘Do you like to 
kill things so you can look at them?’ 
And I said, ‘Oh, yes; it’s fun, be- 
cause we always win and have a 
bigger collection than Miss Runge’s 
room has. That’s the way we study 
things, Miss Dorsey always tells us.’ 
And then I smashed an ant to show 
Him how things died. 

“And God said He liked to study 
things too. But He studies little 
children instead of bugs. Only He 
doesn’t need to kill them first. He 
said He’s a — ’poflogist; He learns 
about civ — civiliz-shuns. That’s His 
job. He said He could always tell 
what a civiliz-shun would be when 
it grew up if He studied little chil- 
dren. I don’t know what He means.” 

“What else did you talk about?” 
Doctor Beckwith asked casually. 
“Your new bicycle? Or school?” 

Tommy shook his head. “God 
wanted to hear about things dying — 
mostly. I told Him how Jeanie got 
run over by a car that didn’t stop 
and nobody ever found out who. 
And He asked me what we would do 
if somebody did find out who, and 
1 said, ‘Oh, he’ll get kihed in the 
jail.’ And I told Him all about that 
chair with elec-trisity in it that 
Daddy said they had in a dungeon at 
the jail. And God said, ‘Does your

daddy people too?’ Amd 1 said, 
•Oh, yes.’” 

Amy made a strangled sound. 
‘Tommy! You shouldn’t have said 
that! You know your father is the 
sweetest, kindest man alive. He 
would never kill anybody.” 

Tommy looked at her with widen- 
ed eyes. “But you said he did.” 

“When did I ever say anything 
like that?” 

“When he was in an airplane. 
When he got a medal for killing all 
those people in the war, and we all 
had to stand while the soldiers 
marched and the gen’ral pinned 
those ribbons on Daddy’s uniform 
and I got sick from ice cream.” 
Tommy finished with several yawns. 

Beckwith signaled, and the par- 
ents unobtrusively moved toward the 
door. They heard Tommy’s mur- 
mured, “Good night, Daddy; Good 
night, Mommy.” 

r ie doctor joined them later, 
frankly puzzled. “It’s a fantasy 
that’s settled in pretty deep,” he told 
them, “so strong that this oharacter 
be talks about has become as real 
to him as you or Amy. He’s not 
retreating into it yet to escape from 
the problems around him; that’s a 
hopeful sign.” 

“But your word ‘yet’ means you 
are afraid he will take the next step 
toward withdrawal — and insanity?” 
Amy cried out. And Ben snapped, 
“Let’s have k straight, George. We’re 
friends and neighbors; I want your 
verdict without any of the evasions 
and glib double^alk doctors dish 
out.” 

“Actually, I’m not sure, Ben.” 



Beckwith sat and fisihed out his pipe. 
‘Tommy’s played with Jerry enough 
so that I’ve observed samples of that 
astounding imagination of his. I’ve 
watched him and Jerry talking to 
their toys as if they lived, but neither 
kid has ever lost the sense of its 
being just a game. So I took a chance 
and tried a bit of hypnotism on Tom- 
my. I thought I could focus this 
aberration for him so he’d under- 
stand it clearly as a creation of his 
imagination.” 

“But it didn’t work,” Amy broke 
in, her perception sharpened by anx- 
iety. 

Beckwith laughed ruefully. “That 
boy cannot be hypnotized. I thought 
I had him under; he reacted exactly 
Hke anyone I’ve put into deep hyp- 
notic trance; he responded in all the 
expected ways to my suggestions.” 

He stopped, shook his head, and 
the edge of ironic amusement came 
into his voice. “When I waked your 
son, he not only had this fantasy as 
vividly as ever, he also told me I 
was all wrong about it being a game 
of pretend with his toys. That just 
doesn’t happen in the case of a per- 
son who has been hynotized and 
then awakened with the command 
to forget all that occurred during 
the session. Your Tommy was able 
to repeat every damned word we 
said to each other while I had him 
under — verbatim.” 

he next day was Sunday. 

Ben came outside to wash his 
car and saw his neighbor lay down 
pruning sihears and beckon. “I just 
spotted your son slipping across into 
the park,” he told Ben. “Let’s see if 




THE PRETEND KIND 



101 




we can get a line on what he's up 

to.” 

They found it relatively easy to 
keep the little boy in Slight, observ- 
Mig from an upper path parelleling 
his course. From its height they 
could look down the wooded slope 
and see him plainly most of the time, 
meandering along with an aimless- 
ness wfhddh indicated that he had no 
special destination in mind, stop- 
ping to turn over a rock to see what 
it hid, or to watch a bird o-r chase 
a butterfly. At times interlaced 
branches hid the boy fro<m them, but 
they could hear him singing to him- 
self or talking to a squirrel that 
swore ait him from the safety of an 
oak eyrie, and he appeared in the 
next open area at about the time and 
place the men judged was right.” 

Then, in the deepest part of the 
forested ravine. Tommy passed from 
view under a giant oak’s foliage and 
did not come out of its shadows on 
time. Ben looked at George Beck- 
with and asked, “Think we’d better 
side-‘hill down that way and see 
what’s keeping the kid?” 

“Give him a few more minutes,” 
the psychiatrist muttered. “He’s 
probably flat on the ground watch- 
ing a bug.” 

But Tommy did not emerge. Ben 
and George finally slipped down the 
slope and found no sign of the little 
boy under the oak. The doctor 
growled, “I’ll be damned!” 

And Ben muttered, “I suppose the 
rascal could have spotted us and 
sneaked away across the bottom of 
the ravine — but he’d need to pass 
over open ground in any direction 
from this tree.” 



They stood a few minutes in the 
shade discussing the eel-like quali- 
ties of children and scanning the 
hill slopes. Finally they moved off 
to continue a random search of the 
park. 

Tommy was playing peacefully in 
the patio when th^ returned, but 
his eyes danced with mischief. 1 
fooled you, Daddy,” he chortled. 

“You sure did,” Ben agreed. 
“How did you slip away from that 
tree without us spotting you?” 
Tommy’s voice choked with glee. 
“I didn’t. I was there all the time.” 
“Now wait a minute, son; there 
was no place to hide.” 

“I was in the tree.” 

Beckwith remarked casually, 
“That’s a mighty big tree for you to 
climb.” 

“Oh, I didn’t climb up the tree; 
I went inside. God was waiting for 
me, and He said, ‘Your father is 
trying to find you, so let’s play a joke 
on him.’ So he took my hand and 
we walked right into the tree, and we 
saw you looking everywhere, and I 
heard Doctor Beckwith say a naugh- 
ty word. And then you went on to- 
ward the other end looking for me, 
and God came home with me. He 
wanted to see my toys.” 

Ben found himself unable to speak 
rationally, and Beckwith’s question 
came only after some hesitation. 
“Was God playing with you when 
we crossed the street just now?” 
“Oh, no,” chortled Tommy. “He 
went away. But He helped me make 
things wi^ my erector set, and He 
really liked my machine ; gun and 
the tank that shoots, and that ba- 
zooka . .”

IF 




Ben yelped. “Now wait a little 
ootton-pickin’ minote! Those wasr 
toys are locked up in the store 
room.” He turned to his wife, a 
question in his inflections. “That 

is, they’re supposed to be — those 
damned monsters and toy guns and 
war stuff the grandparents gave him 
for Christmas?” 

“They certainly are,” snapped 
Amy. “And just remember that it 
was your parents as well as mine.” 
She looked hard into Tommy’s eyes. 
“Now Tommy, you know this is a 
lie; you know those shooting toys 
are in the store room.” 

“Oh, I took God in there to see 
them,” Tommy answered. 

“Son,” his father said gravely, 
“you know you cannot get into that 
room because the door is always 
locked.” 

“Oh, we didn’t use the door,” 
Tommy interrupted, filled to the 
brim with laughter. “We just went 
right through the back wall. God put 
His arm around me and said some- 
thing about our atoms would have 
to go between some other atoms and 
it would feel different and not to 
be afraid. And I wasn’t. It felt 
funny — like dancing all over in- 
side your skin.” 

“That’s qudite a stunt, son,” Ben 
comimented, trying to control has 
voice. 

“And then I did something very 
bad.” Tommy’s face puckered up. 
“I let one of Daddy’s secrets out. I 
couldn’t quit after I started to say 

it, really-truly. I toid Him all about 
Daddy working on some rockets 
that would kill all die Russians. 

“And God made a funny joke. He 



said. ‘We can't let that happen, can 
we? We’ll just have to ex — ter — 
mm — mate all the pests.’ He didn’t 
seem to be talking to me then, be- 
cause He said, ‘Could you hear all 
the child said?’ several times. I asked 
Him what ex-term-mm-ate was, 
and He said, ‘Oh, we just make 
everything awful hot around the 
germs until they burn up, tind then 
my friends won’t be in any danger 
from it spreading td them.’ And I 
told God that was what Daddy did 
to hornets’ nests with his blowtorch, 
and God laughed. That’s why I knew 
it was a joke.” 

Beckwith broke in with his 
soothing voice. “Tommy, I need a 
little holiday in the morning. How 
about taking me with you when you 
talk to this person you call God?” 

Tommy shook his head. “I can’t, 
because God isn’t going to come 
down any more.” 

Amy cried, “How do you know 
that?” 

“He said so.” 

Outside Beckwith shook his head 
thoughtfully. “This new develop- 
ment I don’t understand,” he told 
Ben Wilson. “The boy is deliberately 
ending this particular fancy. Does 
that mean my offer to go with him 
chased him back into reality? Or is 
this the prelude to constructing an- 
other imaginary adventure?” 

T ieir wondering bad only a short 
span to plague them. They un- 
derstood before the falling of an- 
other night — for the space of a 
few breaths only — when the mile- 
loog ships appeared over Earth, and 
the fires began. END

IF ♦ Short Story 



To Conquer Earth 

by GARRETT BROWN 



They came from space fo 
conquer Earth — but why 
didn't Earthmen show fear? 



T he savage squatted naked on a 
flat rock. Tight-skinned from 
the bitter cold, he swayed slowly 
back and forth like a small unkempt 
brown bush in the perpetual icy 
winds of Tierra del Fuego. His long 
greasy hair streamed out horizon- 
tally — sometimes whipping com- 
pletely around him and blowing in 
his eyes. From under crusted lids, 
watching the last of the sun, they 
were bloodstained, and blank as 
stones. He was alone beneath the 
heavy sky, the very incarnation of 
Dichot’s dark masterpiece in oils, 
“The Aborigine”. Except for the 
flotsam of . civilization that washed 
around him in the blowing sand, he' 
might have been any one of his nak- 
ed ancestors who in succession en- 
dured the elements on the same rock 
since the coming of man to the Is- 
land. 



Alas, however, this particular sav- 
age Lived Better Electrically. 

He brushed his teeth and decorat- 
ed himself in poster paint with an 
electric toothbrush, procured his 
food with an electric can-opener, de- 
loused himself with Sweat Sock deo- 
derant, forswore tribal legends for 
articles like “New Hope for the 
Dead” in Reader's Digest, and drank 
excessively of Tierra’s explosive do- 
mestic bourbon. 

Now darkness was enveloping the 
island with characteristic speed. The 
savage struck a cigar on his horny 
foot, inhaled with a grunt of abo- 
riginal satisfaction, and turned on 
his TV. 

The late show was sagging as 
usual, despite a slick foundation of 
commercials peddling the new force- 
field brassiere. The savage was quite 
accustomed to nonsupport of all 



104 




kinds, and his attention wandered. 
He heard it then very suddenly, even 
over the noise of wind and windbag; 
saw the blowing grassland illuminat- 
ed as if by the rising of the moon. 
He looked up in time to watch the 
flaring spot expand to a monstrous 
silver globe, ringed in its own fires 
and shaking the ground with painful 
thunder. He shielded his face as it 
hurtled to a landing on the slope 
below, and while the risen dust cloud 
was stripping away in the wind, he 
drank from his bottle and waited 
and waited, with eyes growing some- 
what more spiritual than before. 

A fter an hour, the ship swept 
again northward, above all but 
the thinnest remnants of the atmo- 
sphere. It was nightside, but from 
the edge of space the great curve of 
one horizon burned faintly orange 
with the coming dawn. TTie other 
horizon was only visible because it 
occulted an immense black wound 
out of the sphere of stars. The con- 
tinents, however, were sharply de- 
fined. Most of the land surface glow- 
ed a ragged shimmering gray from 
the numberless lights of the single 
metropolis that stretched from shore 
to shore and slumbered unknowing 
below. 

On the control deck. Captain 
Crunch was alone with the data re- 
corders, watching the city-continent 
move slowly down the viewscreen. 
His translucent body lay in its in- 
flated bowl and quivered with irri- 
tation, and flaccid eddies of flesh 
rolled from one side of the couch 
to the other. Blast! The interview 
with the primitive had been ridicu- 



lous! (Before even leaving the ship 
he had gotten two gelatinous legs 
stuck in one leghole of his space- 
suit and was forced to hop soddenly 
around the deck to keep from fall- 
ing, accompanied by muted plops of 
mirth from officers and crew.) 

The being selected for “first con- 
tact” had been apparently unmoved 
by the ship’s arrival. Amazed, after 
a short wait he decided to hasten 
Stage Two. He ordered out the full 
display: robots, weapons, lights, lines 
of guards, and technicians and equip- 
ment, and still the creature just sat 
there. They had almost decided that 
it was non-sentient — a vegetable, 
growing in front of the radiating 
box — when it arose, stretched its 
grotesque limbs, and lurched down 
to the very boundary of the death 
screen. It then motioned for atten- 
tion and inscribed a recognizable 
face of the planet in the dust! Quite 
plainly indicated were the polar ice- 
caps, its own island, and finally and 
unmistakably, a spot on the east 
coast of the northern continent. The 
native then pointed several times to- 
ward the north, and retired to watch 
his strange machine. The meeting 
had been over! (It was incredible! 
He could still hardly believe it!) 

To salvage the iniative. Crunch 
ordered Stage Ila. All of the artifacts 
were gathered and dissected, along 
with their owner. 

The creature’s brain proved to be 
so jammed with trivia that no infor- 
mation survived analysis beyond a 
vocabulary of the planet’s dominant 
language. The first contact had 
shown neither fear, bewilderment, 
nor hostility in any form Crunch

was able to recognize. With some 
uneasiness, he had determined to 
seek the place specified in the north- 
ern hemisphere. 

At this point, he was buzzed by 
Electromagnetic and Ranging. The 
“humans” were broadcasting all up 
and down the spectrum, from radio 
to ultraviolet. Automatic beacons! 
D-F indicated a dark spot on the 
screen that was a sizeable landing 
strip. As they started to let down, 
the long coastline was just moving 
into dayside. 

T he President sat up into the cold 
bedroom. The sound of a land- 
ing was always a hand that pulled 
him from sleep by the stomach. The 
First Lady slept fitfully on as he 
padded to the window and stood 
shivering in the increasing light. 

A spheroid. It gleamed dry and 
hot on the dewy grass-grown con- 
crete. 

He returned noiselessly for the 
state bathrobe and sat on the edge 
of the bed. After a short time the 
blood flowed again in his legs and 
the birds resumed singing. The 
President was a man in his late 
forties, not lean, but giving that 
impression, with a gray unshaven 
face and soft eyes. He watched the 
ship with unguarded weariness. In 
minutes, ‘ it had voided a scouting 
robot that scuttled away and out of 
his field of view. Shortly the thing 
was clanking and beeping in the 
garden below and woke the First 
Lady. 

She sat up, breathing warmly be- 
side him. They looked at each other 
for a moment, and she rubbed her 



eyes and went for his breakfast. 
Without haste, he dressed in the 
special suit and stood contemplat- 
ing her cooling impression in the 
bed. 

The President and the aliens ar- 
rived outside at the same moment. 

He saw that they were big and 
purple and repulsive — perhaps seven 
feet high in bulging suits with trans- 
parent domes. He had approached 
to five yards and was pleased to see 
them growing restless; shivering, like 
Jell-O anticipating the spoon. He 
spotted the standard galactic trans- 
lator, and was about to offer his 
crystalline vocabulary, when there 
was a barrage of plopping sounds 
from one of them, and the machine 
said with a slight Spanish accent: 
“Halt! Who goes there?” 

That was unfortunate. It meant a 
mutilated corpse lying around some- 
where, probably a movie addict from 
the quality of the challenge. “All 
right,” he said, and stopped. Nothing 
happened. They watched each other. 
The President pulled a speech out 
of his pocket and began to read it 
aloud. After a few seconds, the ma- 
chine erupted in the brittle plopping 
of the alien language. 

It was a cold, exhiliarating morn- 
ing, and the meeting was given an 
unreal, pastoral aspect by the rising 
mist. “Welcome conquerors,” he said 
brightly, “to the planet Earth. By the 
authority vested in me by the world 
government, I, the President of the 
United States, gitfc you greetings 
from your new subjects, the people 
of Earth.” He paused and held the 
paper closer to his eyes. “Excuse 
me.” The machine faltered. He walk-

ed over and held the paper up to 
the eerie light of the death screen 
and continued, slower than before. 
“You will meet with no resistance 
or hostility, and the something or 
other, something will be vouchsafed 
you that . I’m afraid I have for- 
gotten my glasses. With your per- 
mission I will, as we say, wing it! 
heh, heh, heh.” The President 
searched his pockets and replaced 
the speech in one of them. The ma- 
chine was plopping furiously. “You 
are to be informed that you can have 
anything we have on the planet, and 
that we will abide by your laws, 
whatever they may be. Also, I was 
to give you the key to Earth, how- 
ever, ah . gentlemen, it wasn’t 
returned the last time. You won’t 
need it. I’m sure. My name, by the 
way is Hubert H. Hubris, and my 
general duty is to greet all conquer- 
ing super-aliens, show them around, 
keep them happy. Is it working?” He 
pointed to the interpreter, which was 
pouring out a volume of plops and 
flashing lights and shaking its stand. 

T here was a stunned silence from 
the aliens. The President wait- 
ed. Their grotesque pudding of a 
commander shuddered in his suit 
and shot an unreadable look at his 
subordinates. Then he spoke. 

“How did you anticipate our ar- 
rival?” 

“Not bad,” said the President un- 
helpfully. He shifted to the other 
foot. “There are models that trans- 
late idiomatically, but I have always 
felt that they lack a certain diplo- 
matic formality. Don’t you agree?” 
They were trembling like things 



washed up on the beach. The com- 
mander began to plop ferociously, 
but the machine subverted the effect 
by rendering it to English in a per- 
fectly even voice (with a slight 
Spanish accent) : “Silence, earthman. 
Yours is the audacity of a young 
and ignorant race. Before you stand 
the star-guard of the mighty Glom, 
scourge of the Universe. I am^ Cap- 
tain Crunch, ordered to seize the 
backward worlds in this sector as 
bases in our struggle with the vi- 
cious enemies of the Glom. Your 
words are not rational; you display 
no race pride. Where are your peo- 
ple, your armies, your pitiful de- 
fenses?” 

The Earthman restrained a laugh. 
“Ah . pardon me, your Ignor- 
ance,” he said, having a little sport 
with the interpreter, “If you will just 
let me continue with our usual rou- 
tine, you will understand your sub- 
jects better. Here is a list, in Galactic, 
of the mineral wealth of the planet, 
and a tentative schedule of your ap- 
pearances. I think we can make 
your stay here quite pleasant.” At 
that point, a very fat young man 
bustled up behind the president, 
grinning vacantly. “Well . and 
here is the Vice-President, Edward 
Plimptosac. Everyone just calls him 
Flaccid Eddie. He will assist me with 
the lesser details of your tyranny.” 
(Want to see some dirty prescrip- 
tions? Twelve-year-old-virgins?) 

The Glom had resented Flaccid 
Eddie from the first. Although he 
was opaque, the latter probably look- 
ed more like them than any other 
Earthman; and to their commander, 
he was a gross, insulting caricature

ci the Noblest Form. A small pasty 
apparition of disgusting solidarity! 
Gods! This tiresome planet! His 
brains were very weary as he sloshed 
on his seat in the hurtling bus. These 
last three days had tested the legen- 
dary Glom composure to the quiv- 
ering limit. Cnmch had been forced 
to censor the daily reports back to 
base, his mission hindered every- 
where by bewildering indignities. He 
had to pity the little vermin, but he 
hated them because something about 
their squalid affluence rang very 
close to home. No one had even 
come out to watch the parade, and 
no one had shown up at the exhibits. 
And now this foolish ‘television* 
business. (He almost wished that he 
could believe it was all a super-plot.) 
And that devious primitive “Hu- 
bert”! They were on the way to the 
studio to “broadcast to all human- 
ity, and rally them behind the Glom 
war effort.” He groaned as the bus 
dove in and out of the huge pot- 
holes. 

T he thrice-accursed scouting ro- 
bot was lost. After discovering 
nothing of value, it was carried by 
a crushing mob of humans down 
into some kind of underground rail- 
ed transportation network, and had 
been swept away somewhere, radiat- 
ing too weakly to be homed. Look- 
ing through its sensors, the Glom 
techs didn’t begin to understand how 
to get it out. Crunch, of course, 
couldn’t make a direct request of a 
primitive for any reason. Flaccid Ed- 
die’s response to an obvious hint was 
to suggest that they provide it wHh 
a fare. 



They were rushing down a paved 
strip in the crude vehicle provided 
by Hubert. Cars and trucks were 
rushing at them from all directions, 
dodging and swerving with spindly 
Earthmen leering from the windows. 
The center and sides were littered 
with wreckage; burned, bent, and 
twisted along every mile. Captain 
Crunch was shocked to see the brok- 
en carapace of one of Glomdom’s 
beetle-like galactic rivals protruding 
horribly from an Earth vehicle 
wrapped around a bridge abutment. 

“The things were here about a 
month ago,” Flaccid Eddie explain- 
ed, “and they liked to drive around, 
and a lot of them got killed. Say, 
don’t I smell something? Yes, I do!” 
He gagged happily, “It has ammonia 
in it!” 

Crunch looked quickly to see who 
was turning more purple, saw the 
rip in his suit, remembered being 
jostled against the Vice-President’s 
tin lunch-box, and turned more pur- 
ple. As he lost consciousness, he pan- 
icked and triggered his personal 
death screen. 

He awoke oozing around naked 
in a transparent globe of methane- 
ammonia, covered with painful oxi- 
dation and fighting to breath. His 
first horrified thought was rebellion! 
He was surrounded by whirling 
lights and figures pointing red-eyed 
machines at him. He saw his suit 
lying on the floor, ripped in a dozen 
places. (“Et tu, Plimptosac!” ) Then 
the translator, inexplicably battered, 
was soothing him and explaining: 
Everything was fine. Although his 
death screen had killed everyone and 
crashed the bus, he was certainly

IF 




not in captivity, and the broadcast 
would go on as scheduled. He would 
soon be on the air. The globe? An 
improvisation — until they could 
send for another spacesuit. 

I n Kansas, the Fosdick family tele- 
vision set lit up their five cheer- 
less faces. Father, Mother, grand- 
mother, and children watched the 
greasy man with the melodious 
voice. 

“Good afternoon, ladies and gen- 
tlemen, this is Reginald Phipps, for 
World Standard News. We have been 
conquered again, folks, and wait till 
you see them! They are big fat pur- 
ple things from — ” he asked a ques- 
tion to the side — “well, we don’t 
know where they’re from, but you’ll 
love ’em. We bought rights to show 
you a whole bunch, but they had a 
little accident coming here on the 
freeway, and there is only one left. 
I regret to announce that the Vice- 
President, Mr. Edward Plimtosac, 
was also killed. We will join our ex- 
citing guest in just a moment, fol- 
lowing this brief word from our 
sponsor.” (Lap dissolve and flash to 
animated squeeze bottle.) 

Sweat Sock! It’s New! The deo- 
derant that makes you sweat! 
Science has known for years 
that perspiration is essential to 
the body’s welfare. At last, 
friends, here is a deoderant that 
stimulates this healthful function 
without the rigors of hard phy- 
sical labor. Just one application 
of Sweat Sock, and it will run 
down your legs, and fill up your 
shoes! 



(Crescendo and fade, camera re- 
turns to Phipps. Beside him in a huge 
transparent plastic bottle, with Sweat 
Sock printed on the front, dangling 
umbilical tubes and cables, is the 
alien.) 

“And now, ladies and gentlemen, 
I give you the boss of the Glop, our 
latest and greatest masters. Captain 
Crunch!*' The camera closed Jn. He 
was slumped, translucent and hid- 
eous without his suit, in the bottom 
half of the globe. He stirred feebly 
and emitted a muffled stream of 
plops, like a garbage can being emp- 
tied. The translating machine wasn’t 
even on the set, and no one could 
understand anything he said. 

The Fosdicks watched cheerlessly. 
After a minute, Mr. Fosdick walked 
over to the set and switched chan- 
nels with a vicious flick of the wrist. 

T he subway was jammed with 
steaming humanity. The scout- 
ing robot clung sullenly to a strap in 
the swaying car. No one paid it the 
slightest attention, except the chil- 
dren. Every day at nine in the morn- 
ing and three-thirty in the afternoon, 
they had kicked it, reviled it, tripped 
it, and covered its vision sensors with 
mucilage and bubble gum. Through- 
out all the long, lonely nights, it had 
ranged along the rattling cars and 
the smelly maze of concourses, half- 
blinded and lost. It had been mus- 
cled out of seats by burly charwom- 
en and harassed by leather-jacketed 
hoods, and the flagging technicians 
had stopped looking through its re- 
maining eye and listening to the 
high alien voices of its childish abus- 
ers.

109 




Finally its instruction signals 
ceased entirely, and the robot switch- 
ed to self-protective override and 
blasted a huge crater up to the open 
air in downtown Baltimore. Twenty 
minutes later, it was seen on Inter- 
state #95, running at full speed, 
clanking rustily toward Washington. 

F rom his darkened bedroom win- 
dow, President Hubris watched 
the departure of the Glom. An hour 
ago the ship had been sealed. It lay 
featureless and silent; ominous, like 
the egg of some too-perfect bird. 
There had been no final communica- 
tion, not evai a fare-thee-well, when 
suddenly it flamed and lifted off, rat- 



tling the glass, and disappeared ig- 
nomniiously into the drizzHng over- 
cast. 

Long after the silence returned, 
the President saw the robot appe^ 
out of the twilight and run jerkily 
across the dimming white of the 
concrete. At the center, it jumped 
up and down, looking skyward, and 
ran around and around in small de- 
mented circles, waving its arms. Af- 
ter a long time, it fell down and 
flailed itself into inert junk. 

The President struck a dgar on 
his priceless Louis Quatorze chair, 
inhaled with a grunt of decadent 
satisfaction and turned on his TV.

T he battle was on. Mike had 
played my role as well or better 
than I could. Finn, when he could be 
reached, would be handled by 
“Adam”. So I left, fast, calling out 
Greg’s message of love to Mum. She 
was p-suited and had roused Grand- 
paw and suited him in — first time in 
^ears. Whole family was getting in 
act. So out I went, helmet closed and 
lasergun in hand. 

And reached lock thirteen and 
found it blind-dogged from other 
side with 'nobody in sight through 
bullseye. All correct, per drill, ex-

Illustrated by MORROW 



Their fondest hopes for Luna were being 
realized — it was under the concentrated 
attack of Earth's mightiest war vessels! 



m 





What Has Gone Before — 



We Lunarians have put up with a lot from Earth, but time comes 
when we don't want to put up with more. Earth tells us what we can 
sell, who we sell it to, how much we can get for it. Means slavery. 

But . Earth owns us outright. Question is, what can we do 
about it? I don'f^mind a gamble — wouldn't mind fighting Earth with 
a chance to win — but with no chance, no. Luna has no warships, 

Earth has plenty. Luna has no armies. Earth has armies to burn. 

Most of all, Luna is run by a big computer, and Earth owns the 
computer. 

But there's one thing Earth doesn't own — me. And it just so 
happens that I'm the fellow that fixes the computer . and the 
computer is my good friend I call Mikef 

So maybe — just maybe — we Lunarians can do something at last. 
So we invent mythical leader named "Adam Selene" — is really 
Mike — and start rolling. Only one problem: Need help on Earth. 
That's the hard one, because earthworms 1 don't know, neither does 

Mike, neither does any good Loonie. Don't know where to look . 

until chance delivers one into hands, when group of stilyagi kids ask 
permission to kill him. I save his life, never regret it; name is Stuart 
LaJoie and is high-power VIP Earthworm indeed. 

With him, revolution is good chance. But best chance comes when 
Company overplays hand. Couple guards rape girl, get killed — fight 
is on. Now Company falls right into trap — has Moon under attack 
by every armed ship in space. 

All according to plan ... we hope! 

Finally went back way I had come then blind-dogged every pressure 
— and on through our home, through door on way back. Told Mum, then 
our vegetable tunnels and on up to told her to put one of boys on back 
our private surface lock leading to door with a lasergun — here, take this 
OUT solar battery. one. 

And found a shadow on its bulls- No boys, no men, no able-bodied 
eye when should have been scalding women. Mum, Gramp and our small 
sunlight — damned Terran ship had children were all that were left; rest 
landed on Davis surface! Its jacks had gone looking for trouble. Mimi 
formed a giant tripod over me, was wouldn’t take lasergun. "I don’t 
staring up ks jets. know how to use H, Manuel, and it’s 

Backed down fast and out of too late to learn. You keep it. But 
there, blind-dogging both hatches, they won’t get in through Davis tun-

nels. 1 know some tricks you never 
heard of.” 

Didn’t stop to argue. Arguing with 
Mimi is waste of time — and she 
might know tricks I didn’t know; 
she had stayed alive in Luna a long 
time, under worse conditions than I 
had ever known. 

This time lock thirteen was man- 
ned; two boys on duty let me 
through. I demanded news. 

“Pressure’s all right now,” older 
one told me. “This level, at least. 
Fighting down toward Causeway. 
Say, General Davis, can’t I go with 
you? One’s enough at this lock.” 

“Nyet.” 

“Want to get me an earthworm!” 

“This is your post, stay on it. If 
an earthworm comes this way, he’s 
yours. Don’t you be his.” Left at a 
trot. 

So as a result of own carelessness, 
not keeping p-suit with me, all I saw 
of Battle of Corridors was tail end — 
hell of a “defense minister.” 

Charged north in Ring corridor, 
with helmet open; reached access 
lock for long ramp to Causeway. 
Lock was open; cursed and stopped 
to dog it as I went through, warily — 
saw why it was open; boy who had 
been guarding it was dead. So moved 
most cautiously down ramp and out 
onto Causeway. 

Was empty at this end but could 
see figures and hear noise in-city, 
where it opens out. Two figures in 
prsuits and carrying guns detached 
selves and headed my way. Burned 
both. 

One p-suited man with gun looks 
much like another; I suppose they 
took me for one of their flankers. 



And to me they looked no different 
from Finn’s men, at that distance — 
save that I never thought about it. 
A new chum doesn’t move way a 
cobber does; he moves feet too high 
and always scrambling for traction. 
Not that I stopped to analyze, not 
even: “Earthworms! KillV' Saw 

them, burned them. They were slid- 
ing softly along floor before realized 
what I’d done. 

S topped, intending to grab their 
guns. But were chained to them 
and could not figure out how to get 
loose. Key needed, perhaps. 

Besides, were not lasers but some- 
thing I had never seen: real guns. 
Fired small explosive missiles I 
learned later. Just then all I knew 
was no idea how to use. Had spear- 
ing knives on end, too, sort called 
“bayonets,” which was reason I tried 
to get them loose. Own gun was good 
for only ten full-power burns and 
no spare power pack; those spearing 
bayonets looked useful. One had 
blood on it, Loonie blood I assume. 

But gave up in seconds only, used 
belt knife to make dead sure they 
stayed dead, and hurried toward 
fight, thumb on switch. 

Was a mob, not a battle. Or may- 
be a battle is always that way, con- 
fusion and noise and nobody really 
knowing what’s going on. In widest 
part of Causeway, opposite Bon 
Marche where Grand Ramp slopes 
northward down from level three, 
were several hundred Loonies, men 
and women, and children who should 
have been at home. Less than half 
were in p-suits and only a few 
seemed to have weapons. And pour- 



114 



IF 




ing down ramp were soldiers, all 
armed. 

But first thing I noticed was noise, 
din that filled my open helmet and 
beat on ears — a growl. Don’t know 
what else to call it; was compounded 
of every anger human throat can 
make, from squeals of small children 
to bull roars of grown men. Sounded 
like biggest dog fight in history. And 
suddenly realized I was adding my 
share, shouting obscenities and word- 
less yells. 

Girl no bigger than Hazel vaulted 
up onto rail of ramp, went dancing 
up it centimeters from shoulders of 
troopers pouring down. She was 
armed with what appeared to be a 
kitchen cleaver; saw her swing it, 
saw it connect. Couldn’t have hurt 
him much through his p-suit but he 
went down and more stumbled over 
him. Then one of them connected 
with her, spearing a bayonet into her 
thigh and over backwards she went, 
falling out of sight. 

Couldn’t really see what was going 
on, nor can remember — ^just flashes, 
like girl going over backwards. Don’t 
know who she was, don’t know if 
she survived. Couldn’t draw a bead 
from where I was, too many heads 
in way. But was an open-counter dis- 
play, front^ of a toy shop on my 
left; I bounced up onto it. Put me a 
meter higher than Causeway pave- 
ment with clear view of earthworms 
pouring down. Braced self against 
wall, took careful aim, trying for 
left chest. 

Some uncountable time later 
found that my laser was no longer 
working, so stopped. Guess eight 
troopers did not go home because 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



of me but hadn’t counted — and time 
really did seem endless. Although 
everybody moving fast as possible, 
looked and felt like instruction movie 
where everything is slowed to frozen 
motion. 

At least once while using up my 
power pack some earthworm spotted 
me and shot back. Was explosion 
just over my head and bits of shop’s 
wall hit helmet. Perhaps that hap- 
pened twice. 

Once out of juice I jumped down 
from toy counter, clubbed laser and 
joined mob surging against foot of 
ramp. All this endless time (five 
minutes?) earthworms had been 
shooting into crowd; you could hear 
sharp splatl and sometimes plop\ 
those little missiles made as they ex- 
ploded inside flesh or louder pounkl 
if they hit a wall or something solid. 
Was still trying to reach foot of ramp 
when I realized they were no longer 
shooting. 

Were down, were dead, every one 
of them. 

XL 

A ll through Luna invaders were 
dead, if not that instant, then 
shortly. 

Over two thousand troopers dead. 
More than three times that number 
of Loonies died in stopping them. 
Plus perhaps as many Loonies 
wounded, a number never count- 
ed. No prisoners taken in any 
warren, although we got a dozen of- 
ficers and crew from each ship 
when we mopped up. 

A major reason why Loonies, 
mostly unarmed, were able to kill 

115 




armed and trained soldiers lay in 
fact that a freshly landed earthworm 
can’t handle himself well. Our grav- 
ity, one-sixth what he is used to, 
makes all his lifelong reflexes his 
enemy. He shoots high without 
knowing it, is unsteady on feet, can’t 
run properly — feet slide out from 
under him. Still worse, those troop- 
ers had to fight downwards; they 
necessarily broke in at upper levels, 
then had to go down ramps again 
and again, to try to capture a city. 

And earthworms don’t know how 
to go down ramps. Motion isn’t run- 
ning, isn’t walking, isn’t flying. Is 
more a controlled dance, with feet 
barely touching and simply guiding 
balance. A Loonie three-year-old 
does it without thinking, comes skip- 
ping down in a guided fall, toes 
touching every few meters. 

But an earthworm new-chums k, 
finds self “walking on air”. 
struggles, rotates, loses control, winds 
up at bottom, unhurt but angry. 

But these troopers wound up dead; 
was on ramps we got them. 

Those I saw had mastered trick 
somewhat, had come down three 
ramps alive. Nevertheless only a few 
snipers at top of ramp landing could 
fire effectively. Tliose on ramp had 
all they could do to stay upright, 
hang onto weapons, try to reach 
level below. 

Loonies did not let them. Men and 
women (and many children) surged 
up at them, downed them, killed 
them with everything from bare 
hands to their own bayonets. Nor 
was I only lasergun around. Two of 
Finn’s men swarmed up on balcony 
on Bon Marche and, crouching there, 



picked off snipers at top of ramp. 
Nobody told them to, nobody M 
them, nobody gave orders. Finn 
never had chance to control his half- 
trained disorderly militia. Fight start- 
ed, they fought. 

And that was biggest reason why 
we Loonies won: We fought. 

Most Loonies never laid eyes on a 
live invader. But wherever troopers 
broke in. Loonies rushed in like 
white corpuscles — and fought. No- 
body told them. Our feeble organ- 
ization broke down under surprise. 
But we Loonies fought berserk and 
invaders died. No trooper got farther 
down than level six in any warren. 
They say that people in Bottom Alley 
never knew we were invaded until 
over. 

B ut invaders fought well, too. 

These troopers were not only 
crack riot troops, best peace enforc- 
ers for city work F.N. had; they also 
had been indoctrinated and drugged. 
Indoctrination had told them (cor- 
rectly) that their only hope of go- 
ing Earthside again was to capture 
warrens and pacify them. If they did, 
they were promised relief and no 
more duty in Luna. But was win or 
die, for was pointed out that their 
transports could not take off if they 
did not win, as they had to be re- 
plenished with reaction mass — im- 
possible without first capturing Luna. 
(And this was true.) 

Then they were loaded with ener» 
gizers, don’t-worries and fear inhib- 
itors that would make mouse spit at 
cat, and turned loose. They fought 
professionally and quite fearlessly — 
died.

IF 




In Tycho Under and in Churchill 
they used gas and casualties were 
more one-sided. Only those Loon- 
ies who managed to reach p-suits 
were effective. Outcome was same, 
simply took longer. Was knockout 
gas as Authority had no intention 
of killing us all. Simply wanted to 
teach us a lesson, get us under con- 
trol, put us to work. 

Reason for F.N.’s long delay and 
apparent indecision arose from meth- 
od of sneak attack. Decision had 
been made shortly after we em- 
bargoed grain (so we learned from 
captured transport officers); time 
was used in mounting attack — much 
of it in a long elliptical orbit which 
went far outside Luna’s orbit, cross- 
ing ahead of Luna, then looping 
back and making rendezvous above 
Farside. Of course Mike never saw 
them; he’s blind back there. He had 
been skywatching with his ballistic 
radars. But no radar can look over 
horizon. Longest look Mike got of 
any ship in orbit was eight minutes. 
They came skimming peaks in tight, 
circular orbits, each straight for tar- 
get with a fast dido landing at end, 
sitting them down with high gee, 
precisely at new earth, 12 Oct 76 
Gr. 18h-40m-36.9s — if not at that 
exact tenth of a second, then as close 
to it as Mike could tell from blip 
tracks. Elegant work, one must ad- 
mit, on part of F.N. Peace Navy. 

Big brute that poured a thousand 
troops into L-City Mike did not see 
until it chopped off for grounding — 
a glimpse. He would have been able 
to see it a few seconds sooner had 
he been looking eastward with new 
radar at Marc Undarum site, but 



happened he was drilling “his idiot 
son” at time and they were looking 
through it westward at Terra. Not 
that those seconds would have mat- 
tered. Surprise was so beautifully 
planned, so complete, that each land- 
ing force was crashing in at Green- 
wich 1900 all over Luna, before any- 
body suspected. No accident that it 
was just new earth with all warrens 
in bright semi-lunar. Authority did 
not really know Lunar conditions — 
but did know that no Loonie goes 
up onto surface unnecessarily during 
bright semi-lunar, and if he must, 
then does whatever he must do 
quickly as possible and gets back 
down inside — and checks his radia- 
tion counter. 

So they caught us with our p-suits 
down. And our weapons. 

But with troopers dead we still 
had six transports on our surface and 
a command ship in our sky. 

O nce Bon Marche engagement 
was over, I got hold of self 
and found a phone. No word from 
Kongville, no word from Prof. J- 
City fight had been won, same for 
Novylen. Transport there had top- 
pled on landing; invading force had 
been understrength from landing 
losses and Finn’s boys now held dis- 
abled transport. Still fighting in 
Churchill and Tycho Under. Nothing 
going on in other warrens. Mike had 
shut down tubes and was reserving 
interwarren phone links for official 
calls. An explosive pressure drop in 
Churchill Upper, uncontrolled. Yes, 
Finn had checked in and could be 
reached. 

So I talked to Finn, told him 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



117 




where L-City transport was, arranged 
to meet at easement lock thirteen. 

Finn had much same experience 
as I — caught cold save he did have 
p-suit. Had not been able to estab- 
lish control over lasergunners until 
fight was over and himself had 
fought solo in massacre in Old 
Dome. Now was beginning to round 
up his lads and had one officer tak- 
ing reports from Finn’s office in 
Bon Marche. Had reached Novylen 
subcommander but was worried 
about HKL — “Mannie, should I 
move men there by tube?” 

Told him to wait. They couldn’t 
get at us by tube, not while we con- 
trolled power, and doubted if that 
transport could lift. “Let’s look at 
this one.” 

So we went out through lock thir- 
teen, clear to end of private pressure, 
on through farm tunnels of a neigh- 
bor (who could not believe we had 
been invaded) and used his surface 
lock to eyeball transport from a point 
nearly a kilometer west of it. We 
were cautious in lifting hatch lid. 

Then pushed it up and climbed 
out; outcropping of rock shielded 
us. We Red-Indianed around edge 
and looked, using helmet binox. 

Then withdrew behind rock and 
talked. Finn said, “Think my lads 
can handle this.” 

“How?” 

“If I tell you, you’ll think of reas- 
ons why it won’t work. So how about 
letting rne run my own show?” 
Have heard of armies where boss 
is not told to shut up — word is 
“discipline.” But we were amateurs. 
Finn allowed me to tag along — un- 
armed. 



T ook him an hour to put it to- 
gether, two minutes to execute. 
He scattered a dozen men around 
ship, using farmers’ surface locks, 
radio silence throughout. Anyhow, 
some did not have p-suit radios, 
city boys. Finn took position farth- 
est west. When he was sure others 
had had time, he sent up a flare. 

When flare burst over ship, every- 
body burned at once, each working 
on a predesignated antenna. Finn 
used up his power pack, replaced it 
and started burning into hull. Not 
door lock. Hull. At once his cherry- 
red spot was joined by another, then 
three more, all working on same bit 
of steel — and suddenly molten steel 
spattered out and you could see air 
fooshl out of ship, a shimmery 
plume of refraction. 

They kept working on it, making 
a nice big hole, until they ran out 
of power. I could imagine hooraw 
inside ship, alarms clanging, emer- 
gency doors closing, crew trying to 
seal three impossibly big holes at 
once, for rest of Finn’s squad, scat- 
tered around ship, were giving treat- 
ment to two other spots in hull. They 
didn’t try to burn anything else. Was 
a non-atmosphere ship, built in or- 
bit, with pressure hull separate from 
power plant and tanks. They gave 
treatment where would do most 
good. 

Finn pressed helmet to mine. 
“Can’t lift now. And can’t talk. 
Doubt they can make hull tight 
enough to live without p-suits. What 
say we let her sit a few days and 
see if they come out? If they don’t, 
then can move a heavy drill up here 
and give ’em real dose of fun.”

IF 




Decided Finn knew how to run 
his show without my sloppy help, so 
went back inside, called Mike and 
asked for capsule to go out to bal- 
listic radars. He wanted to know why 
I didn’t stay inside where it was safe. 

I said, “Listen, you upstart col- 
lection of semi-conductors, you are 
merely a minister-without-portfolio 
while / am Minister of Defense. I 
ought to see what’s going on and I 
have exactly two eyeballs while 
you’ve got eyes spread over half of 
Crisium. You trying to hog fun?” 
He told me not to jump salty and 
offered to put his displays on a video 
screen, say in room L of Raffles. 
Did not want me to get hurt . 
and had I heard joke about drillman 
who hurt his mother’s feelings? 

I said, “Mike, please let me have a 
capsule. Can p-suit and meet it out- 
side Station West — which is in bad 
shape as I’m sure you know.” 
“Okay,” he said, “it’s your neck. 
Thirteen minutes. I’ll let you go as 
far as Gun Station George.” 

Mighty kind of him. Got there 
and got on phone again. Finn had 
called other warrens, located his 
subordinate commanders or some- 
body willing to take charge, and had 
explained how to make trouble for 
grounded transports. All but Hong 
Kong; for all we knew Authority’s 
goons held ' Hong Kong. “Adam,” 
I said, others being in earshot, “do 
you think we might send a crew out 
by rolligon and try to repair link 
Bee Ell?” 

“This is not Gospodin Selene,” 
Mike answered in a strange voice, 
”this is one of his assistants. Adiun 
Selene was in Churchill Upper when 



it lost pressure. I’m afraid that we 
must assume that he is dead.” 
'Whatr 

“I am very sorry, Gospodin.” 
“Hold phone!” Chased a couple 
of drillmen and a girl out of room, 
then sat down and lowered hush 
hood. “Mike,” I said softly, “private 
now. What is this gum-beating?” 

4 4 TV yT an,” he said quietly, “think 
IVX it over. Adam, Selene had 
to go someday. He’s served his pur- 
pose and is, as you pointed out, al- 
most out of the government. Profes- 
sor and I have discussed this; the 
only question has been the timing. 
Can you think of a better last use 
for Adam than to have him die in 
this invasion? It makes him a nation- 
al hero . and the nation needs 
one. Let it stand that ‘Adam Selene 
is probably dead’ until you can talk 
to Professor. If he still needs ‘Adam 
Selene’ it can turn out that he was 
trapped in a private pressure and 
had to wait to be rescued.” 

“Well — Okay, let it stay open. 
Personally, I always preferred your 
‘Mike* personality anyhow.” 

“I know you do, Man my first and 
best friend, and so do I. It’s my real 
one. ‘Adam’ was a phony.” 

“Uh, yes. But, Mike, if Prof is 
dead in Kongville, I’m going to need 
help from ‘Adam’ awful bad.” 

“So we’ve got him iced and can 
bring him back if we need him. The 
stuffed shirt. Man, when this is over, 
are you going to have time to take 
up with me that research into humor 
again?” 

“I’ll take time, Mike; that’s a 
promise.” 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



119 




‘Thanks, Man.” Those days you 
and Wyoh never have time to visit 
. and Professor wants to talk about 
things that aren’t much fun. Fll be 
glad when this was is over.” 

“Are we going to win, Mike?” 

He chuckled. “It’s been days since 
you asked me that. “Here’s a pinky- 
new projection, run since invasion 
started. Hold on tight, Man — our 
chances are now evenr 
“Good Bog!” 

“So button up and go see the fun. 
But stay back at least a hundred 
meters from the gun; that ship may 
be able to follow back a laser beam 
with another one. Ranging shortly. 
Twenty-one minutes.” 

Didn’t get that far away, as needed 
to stay on phone and longest cord 
around was less. I jacked parallel 
into gun captain’s phone, found a 
shady rock and sat down. Sun was 
high in west, so close to Terra that 
I could see Terra only by visoring 
against Sun’s glare. No crescent yet, 
new earth ghostly gray in moonlight 
surrounded by a thin radiance of 
atmosphere. 

I pulled my helmet back into 
shade. “Ballistic control, O’Kelly 
Davis now at Drill Gun George. 
Near it, I mean, about a hundred 
meters.” Figured Mike would not 
be able to tell how long a cord I was 
using, out of kilometers of wires. 

“Ballistic control aye aye,” Mike 
answered without argument. “I will 
so inform HQ.” 

“Thank you, ballistic control. Ask 
HQ if they have heard from Con- 
gressman Wyoming Davis today,” 
Was fretted about Wyoh and whole 
family. 



“I v^ill inquire.” Mike waited a 
reasonable time, then said, “HQ 
says that Gospazha Wyoming Davis 
has taken charge of first-aid work 
in Old Dome.” 

“Thank you.” Chest suddenly felt 
better. Don’t love Wyoh more than 
others but — well, she was new. And 
Luna needed her. 

“Ranging,” Mike said briskly. “All 
guns, elevation eight seven zero, azi- 
muth one nine three zero, set paral- 
lax for thirteen hundred kilometers 
closing to surface. Report when eye- 
balled.” 

I stretched out, pulling knees up to 
stay in shade, and searched part 
of the sky indicated, almost zenith 
and a touch south. With sunlight 
not on my helmet I could see stars, 
but inner part of binox were hard 
to position — had to twist around 
and raise up on right elbow. 

Nothing — Hold it, was star with 
disk . where no planet ought to 
be. Noted another star close, watch- 
ed and waited. 

Uh huh! Da! Growing brighter 
and creeping north very slowly — 
hey, that brute is going to land right 
on us! 

But thirteen hundred kilometers is 
a long way, even when closing to 
terminal velocity. Reminded self that 
it couIdn*t fall on us from a depar- 
ture ellipse looking back, would have 
to fall around Luna — unless ship 
had maneuvered into new trajectory. 
Which Mike hadn’t mention. Wanted 
to ask, decided not to. Wanted him 
to put all his savvy into analyzing 
that ship, not distract him with ques- 
tions. 



120 



IF 




All guns reported eyeball track- 
ing, including four Mike was laying 
himself, via selsyns. Those four re- 
ported tracking dead on by eyeball 
without touching manual controls. 
Good new. Meant that Mike had 
that baby taped, had solved trajec- 
tory perfectly. 

Shortly was clear that ship was 
not falling around Luna, was coming 
in for landing. Didn’t need to ask; 
it was getting much brighter and 
position against stars was not 
changing. Damn, it was going to land 
on us\ 

“Five hundred kilometers clos- 
ing,” Mike said quietly. “Stand by 
to burn. All guns on remote control, 
override manually at command 
*burn.’ Eighty seconds.” 

Longest minute and twenty sec- 
onds I’ve ever met — that brute was 
big\ Mike called every ten seconds 
down to thirty, then started chanting 
seconds. “ — five — four — three — two 
— one — BURN! and ship suddenly 
got much brighter. 

Almost missed little speck that 
detached itself just before — or just 
at — burn. But Mike said suddenly, 
“Missile launched. Selsyn guns track 
with me, do not override. Other guns 
stay on ship. Be ready for new co- 
ordinates.” . 

A few seconds or hours later he 
gave new coordinates and added, 
“Eyeball and burn at will.” 

I tried to watch ship and missile 
both, lost both. Jerked eyes away 
from binoculars, suddenly saw mis- 
sile — then saw it impact, between 
us and catapult head. Closer to us, 
less than a kilometer. 

No, it did not go off, not an H- 



fusion reaction, or 1 wouldn’t be 
telling this. But made a big, bright 
explosion of its own, remaining fuel 
I guess, silver bright even in sunlight, 
and shortly I felt-heard ground 
wave. But nothing was hurt but a 
few cubic meters of rock. 

Ship was still coming down. No 
longer burned bright. Could "see it 
as a ship now and didn’t seem hurt. 
Expected any instant that tail of fire 
to shoot out, stop it into a dido land- 
ing. 

Did not. Impacted ten kilometers 
north of us and made a fancy silvery 
halfdome before it gave up and quit 
being anything but spots before eyes. 

Mike said, “Report casualties, se- 
cure all guns. Go below when se-^ 
cured.” 

“Gun Alice, no casualties . 
“Gun Bambie no casualties . .” 
“Gun Caesar, one man hit by rack 
splinter, pressure contained” . 

Went below, to that proper phone, 
called Mike. “What happened, Mike? 
Wouldn’t they give you control after 
you burned their eyes out?” 

‘They gave me contrc^, Man.” 

“Too late?” 

“I crashed it, Man. It seemed the 
prudent course.” 

A n hour later was down with 
Mike, first time in four or five 
months. Could reach Complex Un- 
der more quickly thMi L-City and 
was in as close touch there with any- 
body as would be in city — with no 
interruptions. Needed to talk to 
Mike. 

I had tried to phone Wyoh from 
catapult head tube station. Reached 
somebody at Old Dome temporary 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



121 




hospital and learned that Wyoh had 
collapsed and been bedded down 
herself, with enough sleepy-time to 
keep her out for night. Finn had 
gone to Churchill with a capsule of 
his lads, to lead attack on transport 
there. Stu I hadn’t heard from. Hong 
Kong and Prof were still cut off. At 
moment Mike and I seemed to be 
total government. 

And time to start Operation Hard 
Rock. 

But Hard Rock was not just 
throwing rocks; was also telling Ter- 
ra what we were going to do and 
why — and our just cause for doing 
so. Prof and Stu and Sheenie and 
“Adam” had all worked on it, a 
dummy-up based on an assumed at- 
tack. Now attack had come, and 
propaganda had to be varied to fit. 
Mike had already rewritten it and 
put it through print-out so I could 
study it. 

I looked up from a long roll of 
paper. “Mike, these news stories and 
our message to F.N. all assume that 
we have won in Hong Kong. How 
sure are you.” 

“Probability in excess of eighty- 
two per cent.” 

“Is that good enough to send these 
out?” 

“Man, the probability that we will 
win there, if we haven’t already, ap- 
proaches certainty. That transport 
can’t move. The others were dry, or 
nearly. There, isn’t that much mona- 
tomic hydrogen in HKL; they would 
have to^ come here. Which mean? 
moving troops overland by rolligon 
— a rough trip with the Sun up even 
for Loonies — then defeat us when 
they get here. They can’t. This as- 



sumes that that transport and its 
troops are no better armed than the 
others.” 

“How about that repair crew to 
Bee Ell?” 

“I say not to wait. Man, I’ve used 
your voice freely and made all prep- 
arations. Horror pictures, Old Dome 
and elsewhere, especially Churchill 
Upper, for video. Stories to match. 
We should channel news Earthside 
at once, and announce execution of 
Hard Rock at same time.” 

I took a deep breath. ‘‘Execute 
Operation Hard Rock.” 

“Want to give the order yourself? 
Say it aloud and I’ll match it, voice 
and choice of words.” 

“Go ahead, say it your way. Use 
my voice and my authority as Min- 
ister of Defense and acting head of 
government. Do it, Mike, throw 
rocks at ’em! Damn it, big rocks! Hit 
’em hard!” 

“Righto, Man!” 

XLI 

44 A maximum of instructive 
shrecklichkeit with minimum 
loss of life. None, if possible” — 
was how Prof summed up doctrine 
for Operation Hard Rock and was 
way Mike and I carried it out. Idea 
was to hit earthworms so hard would 
convince them — while hitting so 
gently as not to hurt. Sounds impos- 
sible, but wait. 

Would necessarily be a delay while 
rocks fell from Luna to Terra. Could 
be as little as around ten hours . 
to as long as we cared to make it. 
Departure speed from a catapult is 
highly critical and a variation on 



122 



IF 




order of 1% could double or halve 
trajectory time, Luna to Terra. This 
Mike could do with extreme accur- 
acy. Was equally at home with a 
slow ball, many sorts of curves, or 
burn it right over plate — and I wish 
he had pitched for Yankees. But no 
matter how he threw them, final 
velocity at Terra would be close to 
Terra’s escape speed, near enough 
eleven kilometers per second as to 
make no difference. That terrible 
speed results from gravity well 
shaped by Terra’s mass, eighty times 
that of Luna, and made no real dif- 
ference whether Mike pushed a mis- 
sile gently over well curb or flipped 
it briskly. Was not muscle that 
counted but great depth of that well. 

So Mike could program rock- 
throwing to suit time needed for 
propaganda. He and Prof had set- 
tled on three days plus not more 
than one apparent rotation of Terra 
— 24 hrs 50 min 28.32 sec — to al- 
low our first target to reach initial 
point of program. You see, while 
Mike was capable of hooking a mis- 
sile around Terra and hitting a target 
on its far side, he could be much 
more accurate if he could see his 
target, follow it down by radar dur- 
ing last minutes and nudge it a 
little for pinpoint accuracy. 

We needed fhis extreme accuracy 
to achieve maximum frightfulness 
with minimum-to-zero killing. Call 
our shots, tell them exactly where 
they would be hit and at what sec- 
ond — and give them three days to 
get off that spot. 

So our first message to Terra, at 
0200 12 Oct 76, seven hours after 
they invaded, not only announced 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



destruction of their task force, and 
denounced invasion for brutality, but 
also promised retaliation bombing, 
named times and places, and gave 
each nation a deadline by which to 
denounce F.N.’s action, recognize 
us and thereby avoid being bombed. 
Each deadline was twenty-four hours 
before local “strike.” 

Was more time than Mike needed. 
That long before impact a rock for 
a target would be in space a long 
way out, its guidance thrustors still 
unused and plenty of elbow room. 
With considerably less than a full 
day’s warning Mike could miss Terra 
entirely — kick that rock sideways 
and make it fall around Terra in a 
permanent orbit. But with even an 
hour’s warning he could usually 
abort into an ocean. 

First target was North American 
Directorate. 

All great Peace Force nations, 
seven veto powers, would be hit: N. 
A. Directorate, Great China, India, 
Sovunion, Pan Africa (Chad exempt- 
ed), Mitteleuropa, Brasilian Union. 
Minor nations were assigned targets 
and times, too — but were told that 
not more than 20% of these tar- 
gets would be hit. Partly shortage of 
steel . but also frightfulness. If 
Belgium was hit first time around, 
Holland might decide to protect her 
polders by dealing out before Luna 
was again high in her sky. 

B ut every target was picked to 
avoid if possible killing any- 
body. For Mitteleuropa this was dif- 
ficult. Our targets had to be water 
or high mountains — Adriatic, North 
Sea, Baltic, so forth. But on most of 

123 




Terra is open space despite eleven 
billion busy breeders. 

North America had struck me as 
horribly crowded, but her billion 
people are clumped — is still waste- 
land, mountain and desert. We laid 
down a grid on North America to 
show how precisely we could hit. 
Mike felt that fifty meters would be 
a large error. We had examined 
maps and Mike had checked by 
radar all even intersections, say 
105 °W by 50°N. If no town there, 
might wind up on target grid . 
especially if a town was close enough 
to provide spectators to be shocked 
and frightened. 

We warned that our bombs would 
be as destructive as H-bombs but 
emphasized that there would be no 
radioactive fallout, no killing radia- 
tion — just a terrible explosion, shock 
wave in air, ground wave of concus- 
sion. We warned that these might 
knock down buildings far outside of 
explosion and then left it to their 
judgments how far to run. If they 
clogged their roads, fleeing from 
panic rather than real danger — well, 
that was fine, just fine! 

But we emphasized that nobody 
would get hurt who heeded our 
warnings, that every target first time 
around would be uninhabited. We 
even offered to skip any target if a 
nation would inform us that our 
data were out-of-date. (Empty of- 
fer; Mike’s radar vision was a cosmic 
20 / 20 .) 

But by not saying what would hap- 
pen second time around, we hinted 
that our patience could be exhaust- 
ed. 

In North America, grid was par- 



allels 35, 40, 45, 50 degrees north 
crossed by meridians 110, 115, 120 
west. Twelve targets. For each we 
added a folksy message to natives, 
such as: 

“Target 115 west by 35 north — 
impact will be displaced forty-five 
kilometers northwest to exact top of 
New York Peak. Citizens of Goffs, 
Cima, Kelso and Nipton please note. 

‘Target 100 west by 40 north is 
north 30° west of Norton, Kansas, 
at twenty kilometers or thirteen Eng- 
lish miles. Residents of Norton, Kan- 
sas, and of Beaver City and Wilson- 
ville, Nebraska, are cautioned. Stay 
away from glass windows. It is best 
to wait indoors at least thirty min- 
utes after impact because of possi- 
bility of long, high splashes of rock. 
Flash should not be looked at with 
bare eyes. Impact will be exactly 
0300 your local zone time Friday 16 
October, or 0900 Greenwich time — 
good luck! 

“Target HOW by 50N — impact 
will be offset ten kilometers north. 
People of Walsh, Saskatchewan, 
please note.” 

Besides this grid, a target was se- 
lected in Alaska (150Wx60N) and 
two in Mexico (110Wx30N, 105W- 
x25N) so that they would not feel 
left out, and several targets in the 
crowded east, mostly water, such as 
Lake Michigan half way between 
Chicago and Grand Rapids, and 
Lake Okeechobee in Florida. Where 
we used bodies of water Mike 
worked predictions of flooding waves 
from impacts, a time for each shore- 
line establishment. 

For three days, starting early 
morning Tuesday 13th and going 



124 



IF 




on to strike time early Friday 16ih, 
we flooded Earth with warnings. 
England was cautioned that impact 
north of Dover Straits opposite Lon- 
don Estuary would cause disturb- 
jlnces far up Thames; Sovunion was 
given warning for Sea of Azov and 
had own grid defined; Great China 
was assigned grid in Siberia, Gobi 
Desert, and her far west — with off- 
sets to avoid her historic Great Wall 
noted in loving detail. PanAfrica was 
awarded shots into Lake Victoria, 
still-desert part of Sahara, one on 
Drakensberg in south, one offset 
twenty kilometers due west of Great 
Pyramid — and urged to follow Chad 
not later than midnight Thursday, 
Greenwich. India was told to watch 
certain mountain peaks and outside 
Bombay harbor — time, same as 
Great China. And so forth. 

Attempts were made to jam our 
messages but we were beaming 
straight down on several wavelengths 
— hard to stop. 

W arnings were mixed with prop- 
aganda, white and black — 
news of failed invasion, horror pic- 
tures of dead, names and I.D. num- 
bers of invaders — addressed to Red 
Cross and Crescent but in fact a 
grim beast showing that every troop- 
er had been killed and that all ships’ 
officers and crew had been killed or 
captured. We “regretted” being un- 
able to identify dead of flagship, as 
it had been shot down with destruc- 
tion so complete as to make it im- 
possible. 

But our attitude was concilia- 
tory — “Look, people of Terra, we 
don’t want to kill you. In this nec- 



essary retaliation we are making ev- 
ery effort to avoid killing you . 
but if you can’t or won’t get your 
governments to leave us in peace, 
then we shall be forced to kill you. 
We’re up here, you’re down there. 
You can’t stop us. So please be sen- 
sible!” 

We explained over and over how 
easy it was for us to hit them, how 
hard for them to reach us. Nor was 
this exaggeration. It’s barely pos- 
sible to launch missiles from Terra 
to Luna. It’s easier to launch from 
Earth parking orbit — ^but very expen- 
sive. Their practical way to bomb 
us was from ships. 

This we noted and asked them 
how many multi-million-dollar ships 
they cared to use up, trying it? What 
was it worth to try to spank us for 
something we had not done? It had 
cost them seven of their biggest and 
best already. Did they want to try 
for fourteen? If so, our secret weapon 
that we used on FNS Pax was wait- 
ing. 

Last above was a calculated boast. 
Mike figured less than one chance in 
thousand that Pax had been able to 
get off a message reporting what had 
happened to her and it was still less 
likely that proud F.N. would guess 
that convict miners could convert 
their tools into space weapons. 

Nor did F.N. have many ships to 
risk. Were about two hundred space 
vehicles in commission, not counting 
satellites. But nine-tenths of these 
were Terra-to-orbit ships such as 
Lark — and she had been able to 
make a Luna jump only by stripping 
down and arriving dry. 

Spaceships aren’t built for no pur- 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



125 




pose. Too expensive. F.N. had six 
cruisers that could probably bomb us 
without landing on Luna to refill 
tanks simply by swapping pay load 
for extra tanks. Had several more 
which might be modified much as 
Lark had been, plus a few convict 
and cargo ships which could get into 
orbit around Luna but could never 
go home without refilling tanks. 

Was no possible doubt that F.N. 
could defeat us; question was how 
high a price they would pay. So we 
had to convince them that price was 
too high before they had time to 
bring enough force to bear. A poker 
game. We intended to raise so steep- 
ly that they would fold and drop out. 
We hoped. And then never have to 
•how our busted flush. 

Communication with Hong Kong 
Luna was restored at end of first day 
of radio-video phase, during which 
time Mike was .“throwing rocks,” 
getting first barrage lined up. Prof 
called — and was I happy to hear! 
Mike briefed him, then I waited, ex- 
pecting one of his mild reprimands 
— bracing self to answer sharply: 
“And what was 1 supposed to do? 
With you out of touch and possibly 
dead? Me left alone as acting head 
of government and crisis on top of 
us? Throw it away, just because you 
couldn’t be reached?” 

Never got to say it Prof said, 
“You did exactly right, Manuel. You 
were acting head of government and 
the crisis was on top of you. I’m de- 
lighted that you did not throw away 
the golden moment merely because 
I was out of touch.” 

What can you do with a bloke like 
that? Me with heat up to red mark 



and no chance to use it. Had to swal- 
low and say, “Spasebaw, Prof.” 

P rof confirmed death of “Adam 
Selene.” “We could have used 
the fiction a little longer but this is 
the perfect opportunity. Mike, you 
and Manuel have matters in hand; 
I had better stop off at Churchill on 
my way home and identify his 
body.” 

So he did. Whether Prof' picked 
a Loonie body or a trooper I never 
asked, nor how he silence^ anybody 
else involved. Perhaps no huhu as 
many bodies in Churchill Upper were 
never identified. This one was right 
size and skin color; it had been ex- 
plosively decompressed and burned 
in face — looked awfuli 

It lay in state in Old Dome with 
face covered, and was speechmak- 
ing I didn’t listen to. Mike didn’t 
miss a word. His most human qual- 
ity was his conceit. Some rock head 
wanted to embalm this dead flesh, 
giving Lenin as a precedent. But 
Pravda pointed out that Adam was 
a staunch conservationist and would 
never want this barbaric exception 
made| So this unknown soldier 
wound up in our city’s cloaca. 

Which forces me to tell some- 
thing I’ve put off. Wyoh was not 
hurt, merely exhaustion. But Lud- 
milla never came back. 

I did not know it — glad I didn’t — 
but she was one of many dead at 
foot of ramp facing Bon Marche. 
An explosive bullet hit between her 
lovely, little-girl breasts. Kitchen 
knife in her hand had blood on it — 
I think she had had time to pay 
Ferryman’s Fee.

Stu came out to Complex to tell 
me rather than phoning, then went 
back with me. Stu had not been miss- 
ing; once fight was over he had gone 
to Raffles to work with his special 
code book — but that can wait. Mum 
reached him there and he offered to 
break it to me. 

So then I had to go home for our 
crying-together. Though it is well 
that nobody reached me until after 
Mike and I started Hard Rock. 

When we got home, Stu did not 
want to come in, not being sure of 
our ways. Anna came out and al- 
most dragged him in. He was wel- 
come and wanted; many neighbors 
came to cry. Not as many as with 
most deaths — but we were just one 
of many families crying together 
that day. 

Did not stay long. Couldn't; had 
work to do. I saw Milla just long 
enough to kiss her good-by. She was 
lying in her room and did look as 
if she did be simply sleeping. Then 
I stayed a while with my beloveds 
before going back to pick up load. 
Had never realized, until that day, 
how old Mimi is. Sure, she had seen 
many deaths, some her own descend- 
ants. But little Milla’s death did seem 
almost too much for her. Ludmilla 
was special-^Mimi’s granddaughter, 
daughter in all but fact, and by most 
special exception and through Mimi’s 
intervention her co-wife, most junior 
to most senior. 

Like all Loonies, we conserve our 
dead — and am truly glad that bar- 
baric custom of burial was left back 
on Old Earth. Our way is better. 
But Davis family does not put that

our commercial farming tunnels. No. 
It goes into our little greenhouse 
tunnel, there to become roses and 
daffodils and peonies among soft- 
singing bees. Tradition says that 
Black Jack Davis is in there, or 
whatever atoms of him do remain 
after many, many, many years of 
blooming. 

Is a happy place, a beautiful place. 

XLII 

ame Friday with no answer from 
F.N. 

News up from Earthside seemed 
equal parts unwillingness to believe 
we had destroyed Seven ships and 
two regiments (F.N. had not even 
confirmed that a battle had taken 
place) and complete disbelief that 
we could bomb Terra, or could mat- 
ter if we did. They still called it 
“throwing rice.” More time was 
given to World Series. 

Stu worried because had received 
no answers to code mesages. They 
had gone via LuNuHoCo’s commer- 
cial traffic to their Zurich agent, 
thence to Stu’s Paris broker, from 
him by less usual channels to Dr. 
Chan, with whom I had once had a 
talk and with whom Stu had talked 
later, arranging a communication 
channel. 

Stu had pointed out to Dr. Chan 
that, since Great China was not to 
be bombed until twelve hours after 
North America, bombing of Great 
China could be aborted after bomb- 
ing of North America was a proved 
fact — if Great China acted swiftly. 
Alternatively, Stu had invited Dr. 
Chan to suggest variations in target 



if our choices in Great China were 
not as deserted as we believed them 
to be. 

Stu fretted. Had placed great 
hopes in quasi-cooperation he had 
established with Dr. Chan. Me, I had 
never been sure — only thing I was 
sure of was that Dr. Chan would not 
himself sit on a target. But he might 
not warn his old mother. 

My worries had to do with Mike. 
Sure, Mike was used to having many 
loads in trajectory at once— 7but had 
never had to astrogate more than one 
at a time. Now he had hundreds and 
had promised to deliver twenty-nine 
of them simultaneously to the exact 
second at twenty-nine pin-pointed 
targets. 

More than that. For many targets 
he had back-up misiles, to smear that 
target a second time, a third, or even 
a sixth, from a few minutes up to 
three hours after first strike. 

Four great Peace Powers, and 
some smaller ones, had anti-missile 
defenses; those of North America 
were supposed to be best. But was 
subject where even F.N. might not 
know. All attack weapons were held 
by Peace Forces but defense weap- 
ons were each nation’s own pidgin 
and could be secret. Guesses ranged 
from India, believed to have no 
missile interceptors, to North Amer- 
ica, believed to be able to do a good 
job. She had done fairly well in stop- 
ping intercontinental H-missiles in 
Wet Firecracker War past century. 

P robably most of our rocks to 
North America would reach 
target simply because aimed where 
was nothing to protect. But they 




128 



IF 




couldn’t afford to ignore missile for 
Long Island Sound, or rock for 
87 ° Wx42 ° 30’N — Lake Michigan, 
center of triangle formed by Chicago, 
Grand Rapids, Milwaukee. But that 
heavy gravity makes interception a 
tough job and very costly. They 
would try to stop us only where 
worth it. 

But we couldn’t afford to let them 
stop us. So some rocks were backed 
up with more rocks. What H-tipped 
interceptors would do to them even 
Mike did not know — not enough 
data. Mike assumed that intercep- 
tors would be triggered by radar — 
but at what distance? Sure, close 
enough and a steel-cased rock is in- 
candescent gas a microsecond later. 
But is world of difference between 
a multi-tonne rock and touchy cir- 
cuitry or an H-missile; what would 
“kill” latter would simply shove one 
of our brutes violently aside, cause 
to miss. 

We needed to prove to them that 
we could go on throwing cheap rocks 
long after they ran out of expensive 
(million dollar?) hundred thousand 
dollar?) H-tipped interceptor rock- 
ets. If not proved first time, then 
next time Terra turned North Amer- 
ica toward us, we would go after tar- 
gets we , had been unable to hit first 
time. Backup rocks for second pass, 
and for third, were already in space, 
to be nudged where needed. 

If three bombings on three rota- 
tions of Terra did not do it, we might 
still be throwing rocks in ’77 — till 
they ran out of interceptors ... or 
till they destroyed us (far more like- 
ly)- 

For a century North American 



Space Defense Command had been 
buried in a mountain south of Col- 
orado Springs, Colorado, a city of 
no other importance. During Wet 
Firecracker War this Cheyenne 
Mountain took a direct hit. Space 
defense command post survived — 
but not sundry deer, trees, most of 
city and some of top of mountain. 
What we were about to do" should 
not kill anybody unl^s they stayed 
outside of that mountain despite 
three days steady warnings. 

But North American Space De- 
fense Command was to receive full 
Lunar treatment. Twelve rock mis- 
siles on first pass, then all we could 
spare on second rotation, and on 
third. And so on, until we ran out 
of steel casings, or were put out of 
action ... or North American Di- 
rectorate hollered quits. 

This was one target where we 
would not be satisfied to get just one 
missile to target. We meant to smash 
that mountain and keep on smashing. 
To hurt their morale. To let them 
know we were still around. Disrupt 
their communications and bash in 
command post if pounding could do 
it. Or at least give them splitting 
headaches and no rest. If we could 
prove to all Terra that we could drive 
home a sustained attack on strongest 
Gibraltar of their space defense, it 
would save having to prove k by 
smashing Manhattan or Miami. 

Which we would not do even if 
losing. Why? Hard sense. If we used 
our last strength to destroy a major 
city, they would not punish us; they 
would destroy us. As Prof put it, 
“If possible, leave room for your 
enemy to become your friend.” 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

But any military target is fair 
game. 

D on’t think anybody got much 
sleep Thursday night. All 
Loonies knew that Friday morning 
would be our big try. And everybody 
Earthside knew and at last their 
news admitted that Spacetrack had 
picked up objects headed for Terra, 
presumably “rice bowls” those re- 
bellious convicts had boasted about. 

But was not a war warning, was 
mostly assurances that Moon colony 
could not possibly build H-bombs — 
but might be prudent to avoid areas 
which these criminals claimed to be 
aiming at. (Except one funny boy, 
popular news comic who said our 
targets would be safest place to be. 
This on video, standing on a big X- 
mark which he claimed was HOW 
x40N. Don’t recall hearing of him 
later.) 

A reflector at Richardson Observ- 
atory was hooked up for video dis- 
play and I think every Loonie was 
watching, in homes, taprooms. Old 
Dome — except a few who chose to 
p-suit and eyeball it up on surface 
despite being bright semi-lunar at 
most warrens. At Brigadier Judge 
Brody’s insistence we hurriedly 
rigged a helper antenna at catapult 
head so that his drillmen could watch 
video in ready rooms, else we might 
not have had a gunner on duty. 
(Armed forces — Brody’s gunners, 
Finn’s militia, Stilyagi Air Corps — 
stayed on blue alert throughout per- 
iod.) 

Congress was in informal session 
in Novy Bolshoi Teatr where Terra 
was shown on a big screen. Some 



vips — Prof, Stu, Wolfgang, others — 
watched a smaller screen in Warden’s 
former office in Complex Upper. I 
was with them part time, in and out, 
nervous as a cai with puppies, 
grabbing a sandwich and forgetting 
to eat. But mostly stayed locked in 
with Mike in Complex Under. 
Couldn’t hold still. 

About 0800 Mike said, “Man my 
oldest and best friend, may I say 
something without offending you?” 

“Huh? Sure. When did you ever 
worry about offending me?” 

“Always, Man, once I understood 
that you could be offended. It is 
now only three point five seven times 
ten to the ninth microseconds until 
impact . and this is the most com- 
plex problem I have ever tried to 
solve against real time running. 
Whenever you speak to me, I always 
use a large percentage of my capac- 
ity — perhaps larger than you suspect 
—during several million microsec- 
onds in my great need to analyze 
exactly what you have said and to 
reply correctly.” 

“You’re saying, ‘Don’t joggle my 
elbow. I’m busy.’” 

“I want to give you a perfect so- 
lution, Man.” 

“I scan. Uh . I’ll go back up 
with Prof.” 

“As you wish. But do please stay 
where I can reach you. I may need 
your help.” 

Last was nonsense and we both 
knew it; problem was beyond human 
capacity, too late even to order 
abort. What Mike meant was: I’m 
nervous, too, and want your com- 
pany — but no talking, please. 

“Okay, Mike, I’ll stay in touch. A

phone somewhere. Will punch 
MYCROFTXXX but won’t speak, 
80 don’t answer.” 

“Thank you, Mike my best friend. 
Bolshoyeh Spacebaw.” 

“See you later.” Went up, decided 
did not want company after all, p- 
suited, found long phone cord, 
jacked it into helmet, looped it over 
arm, went clear to surface. Was a 
service phone in utility shed outside 
lock; jacked into it, punched Mike’s 
number, went outside. Got into shade 
of shed and peeked around edge at 
Terra. 

She was hanging as usual halfway 
up western sky, in crescent big and 
gaudy, three-plus days past new. Sun 
had dropped toward western horizon 
but its glare kept me from seeing 
Terra clearly. Chin visor wasn’t 
enough so moved back behind shed 
and away from it till could see Terra 
over shed while still shielded from 
Sun — was better. Sunrise chopped 
through bulge of Africa so dazzle 
point was on land. Not too bad. But 
south pole cap was so blinding white 
could not see North America too 
well, lighted only by moonlight. 

Twisted neck and got helmet bin- 
oculars on it — good ones, Zeiss 
7x50s that had once belonged to 
Warden. 

North America spread like a 
ghostly map before me. Was unus- 
ually free of cloud; could see cities, 
glowing spots with no edges. 0837 — 
At 0850 Mike gave me a voice 
count down. Didn’t need his atten- 
tion. He could have programmed it 
full automatic any time earlier. 

0851 0852 0853 . one minute 
. half minute . ten seconds. 



nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, 
three, two, one — 

And suddenly that grid burst out 
in diamond pin points! 

XLIII 

W e hit them so hard you could 
see it, by bare eyeball hook- 
up; didn’t need binox. Chin dropped 
and I said, ''BojemoiV* softly and 
reverently. 

Twelve very bright, very sharp, 
very white lights in perfect rectan- 
gular array. They swelled, grew dim- 
mer, dropped off toward red, taking 
what seemed a long time. Were other 
new lights but that perfect grid so 
fascinated me I hardly noticed. 

“Yes,” agreed Mike with smug 
satisfaction. “Dead on. You can talk 
now, Man; I’m not busy. Just the 
backups.” 

“I’m speechless. Any fail to get 
through?” 

“The Lake Michigan load was 
kicked up and sideways, did not dis- 
integrate. It will land in Michigan — 
I have no control; it lost its trans- 
ponder. The Long Island Sound one 
went straight to target. They tried to 
intercept and failed. I can’t say why. 
Man, I can abort the followups on 
that one, into the Atlantic and clear 
of shipping. Shall I? Eleven sec- 
onds.” 

“Uh — Dal If you can miss ship- 
ping.” 

“I said I could. It’s done. But we 
should tell them we had backups 
and why we aborted.” 

“Maybe should not have aborted, 
Mike. Idea was to make them use up 
interceptors.” 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 







“But the major idea was to let 
them know that we are not hitting 
them as hard as we can. We can 
test the other at Colorado Springs.” 
“What happened there?” Twisted 
neck and used binox; could see noth- 
ing but ribbon city, hundred-plus 
kilometers long, Denver-Pueblo Mu- 
nicipal Strip. 

“A bullseye. No interception. All 
my shots are bullseyes, Man; I told 
you they would be — and this is fun. 
Fd like to do it every day. It’s a word 
I never had a referent for before.” 
“What word, Mike?” 

“Orgasm. That’s what it is when 
they all light up. Now I know.” 
That sobered me. “Mike, don’t 
get to liking it too much. Because 
if goes our way, won’t do it a second 
time.” 

“That’s okay, Man; I’ve stored it, 
I can play it over any time I want 
to experience it. But three to one we 
do it again tomorrow and even 
money on the next day. Want to bet? 
An hour’s discussion of jokes equat- 
ed with one hundred Kong dollars.” 
“Where would you get a hundred 
doUars?” 

He chuckled. “Where do you 
think money comes from?” 

“Uh — forget it. You get that hour 
free. Shan’t tempt you to affect 
trances.” 

“I wouldn’t chpat, Man, not you. 
We just hit their defense command 
again. You may not be able to see 
k — dust cloud from first one. They 
get it every twenty minutes now. 
Come on down and talk; I’ve turned 
the job over to my idiot son.” 

“Is safe?” 

“I’m monitoring. Good practice 



for him, Man; he may have to do it 
later by himself. He’s accurate, just 
stupid. But he’ll do what you tell 
him to.” 

“You’re calling that computer 
‘he.’ Can talk?” 

“Oh, no, Man, he’s an idiot, he 
can never learn to talk. But he’ll do 
whatever you program. I plan to let 
him handle quite a bit on Saturday.” 

“Why Saturday?” 

“Because Sunday he may have to 
handle everything. That’s the, day 
they slam us.” 

4 4 TTThat do you mean? Mike, 
VV you’re holding something 
back.” 

“I’m telling you, am I not? It’s 
just happened and I’m scanning it. 
Projecting back, this blip departed 
circum-Terra parking orbit just as 
we smashed them. I didn’t see it ac- 
celerate; I had other things to watch. 
It’s too far away to read but it’s the 
right size for a Peace cruiser, head- 
ed this way. Its doppler reads now 
for a new orbit circum-Luna, perisel- 
enion oh-nine-oh-three Sunday un- 
less it maneuvers. First approxima- 
tion, better data later. Hard to get 
that much, Man. He’s using radar 
countermeasures and throwing back 
fuzz.” 

“Sure you’re right?” 

He chuckled. “Man, I don’t con- 
fuse that easily. I’ve got all my own 
lovin’ little signals fingerprinted. 
Correction. Oh-nine-oh-two-point- 
forty-three.” 

“When will you have hipi in 
range?” 

“I won’t, unless he maneuvers. 
But he’ll have me in range late Sat- 



132 



IF 




urday, time depending on what 
range he chooses for launching. And 
that will produce an interesting sit- 
uation. He may aim for a warren. I 
think Tycho Under should be evac- 
uated and all warrens should use 
maximum pressure-emergency meas- 
ures. More likely he will try for the 
catapult. But instead he may hold 
his fire as long as he dares — then 
try to knock out all of my radars 
with a spread set to home each on 
a different radar beam.” 

Mike chuckled. “Amusing, isn’t 
it? For a ‘funny-once’ I mean. If I 
shut down my radars, his missiles 
can’t home on them. But if I do, I 
can’t see to tell the lads where to 
point their guns. Which leaves noth- 
ing to stop him from bombing the 
catapult. Comical.” 

Took deep breath and wished I 
had never entered defense ministry 
business. “What do we do? Give up? 
No, Mike! Not while can fight.” 
“Who said anything about giving 
up? I’ve run projections of this and 
a thousand other possible situations, 
Man. New datum — second blip just 
departed circum-Terra, same char- 
acteristics. Projection later. We don’t 
give up. We give ’em jingle-jan^e, 
cobber.” 

“How?” * 

“Leave it to your old friend My- 
croft. Six ballistic radars here, i^us 
one at the new site. I’ve shut the new 
one down and am making my re- 
tarded child work through number 
two here . and we won’t look at 
those ships at all through the new 
one. Never let them know we have 
it. I’m watching those ships through 
number three and occasionally — ev- 



ery three seconds — checking for new 
departures from circum-Terra. All 
others have their eyes closed tight 
and I won’t use them until time to 
smack Great China and India. And 
those ships won’t see them even then 
because I shan’t look their way; it’s 
a large angle and still will be then. 
And when I use them, then cotnes 
random jingle-jangle, shutting down 
and starting up at odd intervals . 
after the ships launch missiles. A 
missile can’t carry a big brain, Man 
— I’ll fool ’em.” 

44TTThat about ships’ fire-control 
VV computers?” 

“I’ll fool them, too. Want to lay 
odds I can’t make two radars look 
like only one halfway between 
where they really are? But what I’m 
working on now — and sorry! I’ve 
been using your voice again.” 
“That’s okay. What am I supposed 
to have done?” 

“If that admiral is really smart, 
he’ll go after the ejection end of the 
old catapult with everything he’s got 
— at extreme range, too far away 
for our drill guns. Whether he knows 
what our ‘secret’ weapon is or not, 
he’ll smear the catapult and ignore 
the radars. So I’ve ordered the cat- 
apult head — you have, I mean — to 
prepare to launch every load we can 
get ready, and I am now working out 
new, long-period trajectories for each 
of them. Then we will throw them 
all, get them into space as quickly 
as possible — ^without radar.” 
“Blind?” 

“I don’t use radar to launch a 
load; you know that, Man. I always 
watched them in the past but I don’t 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



133 





need to; radar has nothing to do with 
launching; launching is pre-calcula- 
tion and exact control of the cata- 
pult. So we place all ammo from the 
old catapult in slow trajectories, 
which forces the admiral to go after 
the radars rather than the catapult — 
or both. Then we’ll keep him busy. 
We may make him so desperate that 
he’ll come down for a close shot and 
give our lads a chance to burn his 
eyes.” 

“Brody’s boys would like that. 
Those who are sober.” Was turning 
over idea. “Mike, have you watched 
video today?” 

“I’ve monitored video, I can’t say 
I’ve watched it. Why?” 

‘Take a look.” 

“Okay, I have. Why?” 

“That’s a good ’scope they’re using 
for video, and there are others. Why 
use radar on ships? Till you want 
Brody’s boys to burn them?” 

Mike was silent for at least two 
seconds. “Man my best friend, did 
you ever think of getting a job as 
a computer?” 

“Is sarcasm?” 

“Not at all, Man. I feel ashamed. 
The instruments at Richardson — 
telescopes and other things — are 
factors which I simply never includ- 
ed in my calculations. I’m stupid, 
I admit it. Yes, yes, yes, da, da, da! 
Watch ships by telescope, don’t use 
radar unless they vary from present 
ballistics. Other possibilities — I 
don’t know what to say, Man, save 
that it had never occurred to me 
that I could use telescopes. I see by 
radar, always have; I simply never 
consid — ” 

“Stow it!” 



134 



IF 




“I mean it, Man.” 

“Do / apologize when you think 
of something first?” 

Mike said slowly, “There is some- 
thing about that which I am finding 
resistant to analysis. It is my func- 
tion to — ” 

“Quit fretting. If idea is good, use 
k. May lead to more ideas. Switch- 
ing off and coming down, chop- 
chop.” 

H ad not been in Mike’s room long 
when Prof phoned: 

“HQ? Have you heard from Field 
Marshal Davis?” 

“I’m here, Prof, in the Master 
computer room.” 

“Will you join us in the War- 
den’s office? There are decisions to 
reach, work to be done.” 

“Prof, I’ve been working! Am 
working.” 

“I’m sure you have. I’ve explained 
to the others that the programming 
of ballistic computer is so very deli- 
cate in this operation that you must 
check it personally. Nevertheless 
some of our colleagues feel that the 
Minister of Defense should be pres- 
ent during these discussions. So, 
when you reach a point where you 
feel you can turn it over to your 
assistant — Mike is his name, is k 
not? — will you please — ” 

“I scan it. Okay, will be up.” 
“Very well, Manuel.” 

Mike said, “I could hear thirteen 
people in the background. Double- 
talk, Man.” 

“I got it. Better go up and sec 
what huhu. You don’t need me?” 
“Man, I hope you will stay close 
to a phone.” 



“Will. Keep an ear on Warden’s 
office. But will punch in if else- 
where. See you, cobber.” 

Found entire government in War- 
den’s office, both real Cabinet and 
makeweights — and soon spotted 

trouble. Bloke called Howard Wright. 

A ministry had been whomped up 
for him: “Liaison for Arts, Sciences 
and Professions” — button-sorting. 
Was sop to Novylen because Cabinet 
was topheavy with L-City comrades, 
and a sop to Wright because he had 
made himself leader of a Congress 
group long on talk, short on action. 
Prof’s purpose was to short him out. 
But sometimes Prof was too subtle. 
Some people talk better if they 
breathe vacuum. 

Prof asked me to brief Cabinet on 
military situation. Which I did — 
my way. “I see Finn is here. Let’s 
have him tell where we stand in war- 
rens.” 

Wright spoke up. “General Niel- 
sen has already done so, no need to 
repeat. We want to hear from you” 

Blinked at that. “Prof — Excuse 
me. Gospodin President. Do I under- 
stand that a Defense Ministry report 
has been made to Cabinet in my 
absence?” 

Wright said, “Why not? You 
weren’t on hand.” 

Prof grabbed it. He could see I 
was stretched too tight. Hadn’t slept 
for three days, hadn’t been so tired 
since left Earthside. “Order,” he said 
mildly. “Gospodin Minister for Pro- 
fessional Liaison, please address your 
comments through me. Gospodin 
Minister for Defense, let me correct 
that. There have been no reports to 
the Cabinet concerning your ministry

for the reason that the Cabinet did 
not convene until you arrived. Gen- 
eral Nielsen answered some informal 
questions informally. Perhaps this 
should not have been done. If you 
feel so, I will attempt to repair it.” 

“No harm done, I guess. Finn, 
anything new?” 

“No, Mannie.” 

“Okay. Guess what you want to 
hear is off-Luna situation. You’ve 
been watching so you know first 
bombardment went off well. Still 
going on, some, as we’re hitting their 
space defense HQ every twenty min- 
utes. Will continue till thirteen hun- 
dred, then at twenty-one hundred we 
hit China and India, plus minor tar- 
gets. Then busy till four hours past 
midnight with Africa and Europe, 
skip three hours, dose Brasil and 
company, wait three hours and start 
over. Unless something breaks. But 
meantime we have problems here. 
Finn, we should evacuate Tycho 
Under.” 

“Just a moment!” Wright had hand 
up. “I have questions.” Spoke to 
Prof, not to me. 

“One moment. Has the Defense 
Minister finished?” 

W yoh was seated toward back. 

We had swapped smiles, but 
was all — kept it so around Cabinet 
and Congress; had been rumbles that 
two from same family should not be 
in Cabinet. Now she shook head, 
warning of something. 

"I said, “Is all concerning bombard- 
ment. Questions about it?” 

“Are your questions concerned 
with the bombardment, Gospodin 
Wright?” 



“They certainly are, Gospodin 
President.” Wright stood up, looked 
at me. “As you know, I represent the 
intellectual groups in the Free State 
and, if I may say so, their opinions 
are most important in public affairs. 
I think it is only proper that — ” 
“Moment,” I said. “Thought you 
represented Eighth Novylen Dis- 
trict?” 

“Gospodin President? Am I to be 
permitted to put my questions? Or 
not?” 

“He wasn’t asking ^question, was 
making speech. And I’m tired and 
want to go to bed.” 

Prof said gently, “We are all tired, 
Manuel. But your point is well taken. 
Congressman, you represent only 
your district. As a member of the 
government you have been assigned 
certain duties in connection with cer- 
tain professions.” 

“It comes to the same thing.” 
“Not quite. Please state your ques- 
tion.” 

“Uh . very well, I shall! Is Field 
Marshal Davis aware that his bom- 
bardment plan has gone wrong com- 
pletely and that thousands of lives 
have been pointlessly destroyed? And 
is he aware of the extremely serious 
view taken of this by the intelligentsia 
of this Republic? And can he explain 
why this rash — I repeat, rash — 
bombardment was undertaken with- 
out consultation? And is he now pre- 
pared to modify his plans, or is he 
going blindly ahead? And is it true 
as charged that our missiles were of 
the nuclear sort outlawed by all civil- 
ized nations? And how does he ex- 
pect Luna Free State ever to be wel- 
comed into the councils of civilized 



136 



IF 




nations in view of such actions?” 

I looked at watch. Hour and a half 
since first load hit. “Prof,” I said, 
“can you tell me what this is about?” 
“Sorry, Manuel,” he said gently. 
“I intended — I should have — pre- 
faced the meeting with an item from 
the news. But you seemed to feel 
that you had been by-passed and — 
well, I did not. The Minister refers 
to a news despatch that came in just 
before I called you. Reuters in Tor- 
onto. If the flash is correct — if — 
then instead of taking our warnings it 
seems that thousands of sightseers 
crowded to the targets. There prob- 
ably have been casualties. How many 
we do not know.” 

“I see. What was I supposed to do? 
Take each one by hand and lead 
away? We warned them.” 

Wright cut in with, ‘The intelli- 
gentsia feel that basic humanitarian 
considerations make it obligatory — ” 
I said, “Listen, yammerhead, you 
heard President say this news just 
came in — so how do you know how 
anybody feels about it?” 

H e turned red. “Gospodin Presi- 
dent! Epithets! Personalities!” 
“Don’t call the Minister names, 
Manuel.” 

“Won’t jf he won’t. He’s simply 
using fancier words. What’s this non- 
sense about nuclear bombs? We 
haven’t any and you all know it.” 
Prof looked puzzled. “I am con- 
fused by that, too. This despatch so 
alleged. But the thing that puzzled 
me is that we could actually see, by 
video, what certainly seemed to be 
atomic explosions.” 

“Oh.” I turned to Wright. “Did 



your brainy friends tell you what 
happens when you release a few bil- 
lion calories in a split second all at 
one spot? What temperature? How 
much radiance?” 

“Then you admit that you did use 
atomic weapons!” 

“Oh, Bog!” Head was aching. 
“Said nothing of sort. Hit anything 
hard enough, strike sparks. Elemen- 
tary physics, known to everybody 
but intelligentsia. We just struck 
damnedest big sparks ever made by 
human agency, is all. Big flash. Heat, 
light, ultraviolet. Might even produce 
X-rays, couldn’t say. Gamma radia- 
tion I strongly doubt. Alpha and 
beta, impossible. Was sudden release 
of mechanical energy. But nuclear? 
Nonsense!” 

Prof said, “Does that answer your 
questions, Mr. Minister?” 

“It simply raises more questions. 
For example, this bombardment is 
far beyond anything the Cabinet 
authorized. You saw the shocked 
faces when those terrible lights ap- 
peared on the screen. Yet the Min- 
ister of Defense says that it is even 
now continuing!” 

Glanced at watch. “Another just 
hit Cheyenne Mountain.” 

Wright said, “You hear that? You 
hear? He boasts of it. Gospodin 
President, this carnage must stop!” 

I said, “Yammer — Minister, are 
you suggesting that their space de- 
fense HQ is not a military target? 
Which side are you on? Luna’s? Or 
F.N.?” 

“Manuel!” 

“Tired of this nonsense! Was told 
to do job, did it. Get this yammer- 
head off my backr 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



137 




Was shocked silence, then some- 
body said quietly, “May I make a 
suggestion?” 

Prof looked around. “If anyone 
has a suggestion that will quiet this 
unseemliness, I will be most happy 
to hear it.” 

“Apparently we don’t have very 
good information as to what these 
bombs are doing. It seems to me that 
we ought to slow up that twenty- 
minute schedule. Stretch it out, say 
to one every hour — and skip the 
next two hours while we get more 
news. Then we might want to post- 
pone the attack on great China at 
least twenty-four hours.” 

Were approving nods from almost 
everybody and murmurs: “Sensible 
idea!” — “Da. Let’s not rush things.” 
Prof said, “Manuel?” 

I snapped, “Prof, you know an- 
swer! Don’t shove it on me!” 

“Perhaps I do, Manuel ... but 
I’m tired and confused and can’t 
remember it.” 

Wyoh said suddenly, “Mannie, ex- 
plain it. I need it explained, too.” 

S o pulled self together. “A simple 
matter of law of gravitation. 
Would have to use computer to give 
exact answer but next half dozen 
shots are fully committed. Most we 
can do is push them off target — 
and maybe hit some town we haven’t 
warned.. Can*t dump them into an 
ocean, is too late; Cheyenne Moun- 
tain is fourteen hundred kilometers 
inland. As for stretching schedule to 
once an hour, that’s silly. Aren’t 
tube capsules you start and stop; 
these are falling rocks. Going to hit 
somewhere every twenty minutes. 



You can hit Cheyenne Mountain 
which hasn’t anything alive left on 
it by now — or can hit somewhere 
else and kill people. Idea of delaying 
strike on Great China by twenty- 
four hours is just as silly. Can abort 
missiles for Great China for a while 
yet. But can*t slow them up. If you 
abort, you waste them. And any- 
body who thinks we have steel cas- 
ings to waste better go look.” 

Prof wiped brow. “I think all 
questions have been answered, at 
least to my satisfaction.” 

“Not to mine, sir!” 

“Sit down, Gospodin Wright. You 
force me to remind you that your 
ministry is not part of the War 
Cabinet. If there are no more ques- 
tions — I hope there are none — I 
will adjourn this meeting. We all 
need rest. So let us — ” 

“Prof!” 

“Yes, Manuel?” 

“You never let me finish report- 
ing. Late tomorrow or early Sun- 
day we catch it.” 

“How, Manuel?” 

“Bombing. Invasion possible. Two 
cruisers headed this way.” 

That got attention. Presently Prof 
said tiredly, “The Government Cab- 
inet is adjourned. The War Cabinet 
will remain.” 

“Just a second,” I said. “Prof, 
when we took office, you got un- 
dated resignations from us.” 

“True. I hope not to have to use 
any of them, however.” 

“You’re about to use one.” 
“Manuel, is that a threat?” 

“Call it what you like.” I pointed 
at Wright. “Either that yammerhead 
goes ... or I go.” 



138 



IF 




“Manuel, you need sleep.” 

Was blinking back tears. “Cer- 
tainly do! And going to get some. 
Right now! Going to find a doss 
here at Complex and get some. 
About ten hours. After that, if am 
still Minister of Defense, you can 
wake me. Otherwise let me sleep.” 
By now everybody was looking 
shocked. Wyoh came up and stood 
by me. Didn’t speak, just slipped 
hand into my arm. 

Prof said firmly, “All please leave 
save the War Cabinet and Gospodin 
Wright.” He waited while most filed 
out. Then said, “Manuel, I can’t 
accept your resignation. Nor can I 
let you chivvy me into hasty action 
concerning Gospodin Wright, not 
when we are tired and overwrought. 
It would be better if you two were 
to exchange apologies, each realiz- 
ing that the other has been over- 
strained.” 

“Uh— ” I turned to Finn. “Has 
he been fighting?” I indicated 
Wright. 

4 4 T Tuh? Hell, no. At least he’s 
A A not in my outfits. How 
about it, Wright? Did you fight 
when they invaded us?” 

Wright said stiffly, “I had no op- 
portunity. By the time I knew of it, 
it was over. But now both my brav- 
ery and my loyalty have been im- 
pugned. I shall insist — ” 

“Oh. shut up,” I said. “If duel is 
what you want, can have it first mo- 
ment I’m not busy. Prof, since he 
doesn’t have strain of fighting as 
excuse for behavior, I won’t apolo- 
gize to a yammerhead for being a 
yammerhead. And you don’t seem 



to understand issue. You let thif 
yammerhead climb on my back — 
and didn’t even try to stop him! 
So either fire him, right now, or fire 
me.” 

Finn said suddenly, “I match that, 
Prof. Either fire diis louse — or fire 
us both.” He looked at Wright. 
“About that duel, choom — you’re 
going to fight me first. You’ve got 
two arms. Mannie hasn’t.” 

’’Don’t need two aims for him. 
But thanks, Finn.” 

Wyoh was crying — could feel it 
though couldn’t hear it. Prof said to 
her most sadly, “Wyoming?” 

“I’m s-s-soory. Prof! Me, too.” 
Only “Clayton” Watenabe, Judge 
Brody, Wolfgang, Stu and Sheenie 
were left, handful who counted — 
War Cabinet. Prof looked at them; 
I could see they were with me, 
though it cost Wolfgang an effort; 
he worked with Prof, not with me. 

Prof looked back at me and said 
softly, “Manuel, it works both ways. 
What you are doing is forcing me 
to resign.” He looked around. 
“Good night, comrades. Or rather, 
‘Good morning.’ I’m going to get 
some badly needed rest.” He walked 
briskly out without looking back at 
me. 

Wright was gone; I didn’t see him 
leave. Finn said, “What about these 
cruisers, Mannie?” 

I took deep breath. “Nothing ear- 
lier than Saturday afternoon. But 
you ought to evacuate Tycho Under. 
Can’t talk now. Groggy.” 

Agreed to meet him there at twen- 
ty-one hundred, then let Wyoh lead 
me away. Think she put me to bed 
but don’t remember.

XLiV 

P rof was there when I met Finn 
in Warden’s office shortly be- 
fore twenty-one hundred Friday. Had 
had nine hours sleep, bath, break- 
fast Wyoh had fetched from some- 
where and a talk with Mike. Every- 
thing going to revised plan. Ships 
had not changed ballistic. Great 
China strike about to happen. 

Got to office in time to see strike 
by video. All okay and effectively 
over by twenty-one-oh-one and Prof 
got down to business. Nothing said 
about Wright, or about resigning. 
Never saw Wright again. 

I mean I never saw him again. 
Nor ask about him. Prof didn’t men- 
tion row, so I didn’t. 

We went over news and tactical 
situation. Wright had been correct 
in saying that “thousands of lives” 
had been lost; news up from Earth- 
side was full of it. How many we’ll 
never know; if a person stands at 
f»jound zero and tonnes of rock land 
on him, isn’t much left. Those they 
could count were ones farther away, 
killed by blast. Call it fifty thousand 
in North America. 

Never will understand people! We 
spent three days warning them. And 
you couldn’t say they hadn’t heard 
warnings; that was why they were 
there. To see show. To laugh at our 
nonsense. To get “souvenirs.” Whole 
families went to targets, some with 
picnic baskets. Picnic baskets! Boje- 
moi! 

And now those alive were yelling 
for our blood for this “Senseless 
slaughter.” Da. Hadn’t been any in- 
dignation over their invasion and 



(nuclear!) bombing of us four days 
earlier — but oh were they sore over 
our “premeditated murders.” Great 
New York Times demanded that en- 
tire Lunar “rebel” government be 
fetched Earthside and publicly exe- 
cuted — “this is clearly a case in 
which the humane rule against capi- 
tal punishment must be waived in 
the greater interests of all mankind.” 

Tried not to think about it, just 
as had been forced not to think too 
much about Ludmilla. Little Milla 
hadn’t carried a picnic lunch. She 
hadn’t been a sightseer looking for 
thrills. 

Tycho Under was pressing prob- 
lem. If those ships bombed warrens 
— and news from Earthside was de- 
manding exactly that — Tycho Un- 
der could not take it. Roof was thin. 
H-bomb would decompress all levels; 
airlocks aren’t built for H-bomb 
blasts. 

(Still don’t understand people. 
Terra was supposed to have an ab- 
solute ban against using H-bombs 
on people; that was what F.N. was 
all about. Yet were loud yells for 
F.N. to H-bomb us. They quit claim- 
ing that our bombs were nuclear, 
but all North America seemed froth- 
ingly anxious to have us nuke-bomb- 
ed.) 

Don’t understand Loonies for that 
matter. Finn had sent word through 
his militia that Tycho Under must 
be evacuated. Prof had repeated it 
over video. Nor was it problem; 
Tycho Under was small enough that 
Novylen and L-City could doss and 
dine them. We could divert enough 
capsules to move them all in twenty 
hours — dump them into Novylen 



140 



IF 




an encourage half of them to go on 
to L-City. Big job but no problems. 
Oh, minor problems — start com- 
pressing city’s air while evacuating 
people, so as to save it; decompress 
fully at end to minimize damage; 
move as much food as was time for; 
cofferdam accesses to lower farm 
tunnels; so forth. All things we knew 
how to do and with stilyagi - and 
militia and municipal maintenance 
people had organization to do. 

Had they started evacuating? Hear 
that hollow echo! 

Were capsules lined up nose to 
tail at Tycho Under and no room to 
send more till some left. And weren’t 
moving. “Mannie,” said Finn, “don’t 
think they are going to evacuate,” 

4 4T^amn it,” I said, “they’ve got 
-L/ to. When we spot a missile 
headed for Tycho Under will be too 
late. You’ll have people trampling 
people and trying to crowd into cap- 
sules that won’t hold them. Finn, 
your boys have got to make them.” 
Prof shook his head. “No, Man- 
uel.” 

I said angrily, “Prof, you carry 
this ‘no coercion’ idea too far! You 
know they’ll riot.” 

“Then they will riot. But we will 
continue with persuasion, not force. 
Let us now review plans.” 

Plans weren’t much but were best 
we could do. Warn everybody about 
expected bombings and/or invasion. 
Rotate guards from Finn’s militia 
above each warren starting when 
and if cruisers passed around Luna 
into blind space, Farside — not 
caught flat-footed again. Maximum 
pressure and p-suit precautions, all 



warrens. All military and semi-mili- 
tary to go on blue alert sixteen hun- 
dred Saturday, red alert if missiles 
launched or ships maneuvered. 
Brody’s gunners encouraged to go 
into town and get drunk or what- 
ever, returning by fifteen hundred 
Saturday — Profs idea. Finn wanted 
to keep half of them on duty. Prof 
said No, they would be in better 
shape for a long vigil if they re- 
laxed and enjoyed ’selves first. I 
agreed with Prof. 

As for bombing Terra, we made 
no changes in first rotation. Were 
getting anguished responses from In- 
dia, no news from Great China. Yet 
India had Httle to moan about. Had 
not used a grid on her, too heavily 
populated. Aside from picked spots 
in Thar Desert and some peaks, tar- 
gets were coastal waters off sea- 
ports. 

But should have i^ked higher 
mountains or given less warning. 
Seemed from news that some holy 
chose to climb each target peak and 
man followed by endless pilgrims 
hold off our retaliation by sheer 
spiritual strength. 

So we were murderers again. 

Besides that, our water shots 
killed millions of fish and many 
fishermen, as fishermen and other 
seafarers had not heeded warnings. 
Indian government seemed as fur- 
ious over fish as over fishermen. 
But principle of sacredness of all 
life did not apply to us; they wanted 
our heads. 

Africa and Europe responded 
more sensibly but differently. Life 
has never been sacred in Africa and 
those who went sightseeing on tar-

gets got little bleeding-heart treat- 
ment. Europe had a day to learn 
that we could hit where we prom- 
ised and that our bombs were dead- 
ly. People killed, yes, especially bull- 
headed sea captains. But not killed 
in empty-headed swarms as in In- 
dia and North America. Casualties 
were even lighter in Brazil and other 
parts of South America. 

Then was North America’s turn 
again — 0950.28 Saturday 17 Oct 
’76. 

TV yirike timed it for exactly 1000 
our time which, allowing for 
one day’s progress of Luna in orbit 
and for rotation of Terra, caused 
North America to face toward us at 
0500 their east coast time and 0200 
their west coast time. 

But argument as to what to do 
with this targeting had started early 
Saturday morning. Prof had not 
called meeting of War Cabinet but 
they showed up anyhow, except 
“Clayton” Watenabe who had gone 
back to Kongville to take charge of 
defenses. Prof, self, Finn, Wyoh, 
Judge Brody, Wolfgang, Stu, Ter- 
ence Sheehan — which made eight 
different opinions. Prof is right. 
More than three people can’t decide 
anything. 

Six opinions, should say, for 
Wyoh kept pretty mouth shut, and 
so did Prof; he moderated. But oth- 
ers were noisy enough for eighteen. 
Stu didn’t care what we hit — provid- 
ed New York Stock Exchange op- 
ened on Monday morning. “We sold 
short in nineteen different directions 
on Thursday. If this nation is not to 
be bankrupt before it’s out of its 



cradle, my buy orders covering 
those shorts had better be executed. 
Tell them Wolf; make them under- 
stand.” 

Brody wanted to use catapult to 
smack any more ships leaving park- 
ing orbit. Judge knew nothing about 
ballistics — simply understood that 
his drillmen were in exposed posi- 
tions. I didn’t argue as most re- 
maining loads were already in slow 
orbits and rest would be soon — and 
didn’t think we would have old 
catapult much longer. 

Sheenie thought it would be smart 
to repeat that grid while placing one 
load exactly on main building of 
North American Directorate. “I 
know Americans, I was one before 
they shipped me. They’re sorry as 
hell they ever turned things over to 
F.N. Knock off those bureaucrats 
and they’ll come over to our side.” 

Wolfgang Korsakov, to Stu’s dis- 
gust, thought that their speculations 
might do better if all stock exchang- 
es were closed till it was over. 

Finn wanted to go for broke — 
warn them to get those ships out of 
our sky, then hit them for real if 
they didn’t. “Sheenie is wrong about 
Americans; I know them, too. N.A. 
is toughest part of F.N.; they’re 
the ones to lick. They’re already 
calling us murderers, so now we’ve 
got to hit them, hard\ Hit American 
cities and we can call off the rest. 

I slid out, talked with Mike, made 
notes. Went back in; they were still 
arguing. Prof looked up as I sat 
down. “Field Marshal, you have not 
expressed your opinion.” 

I said, “Prof, can’t we lay off 
that ‘field marshal’ nonsense? Chil- 



142 



IF 




dren are in bed, can afford to be 
honest.” 

“As you wish, Manuel.” 

“Been waiting to see if any agree- 
ment would be reached.” 

Was none. “Don’t see why I 
should have opinion,” I went on. 
“Am just errand boy, here because 
I know how to program ballistic 
computer.” Said this looking straight 
at Wolfgang — a number-one com- 
rade but a dirty-word intellectual 
I’m just a mechanic whose gram- 
mar isn’t much while Wolf graduat- 
ed from a fancy school, Oxford, be- 
fore they convicted him. He deferred 
to Prof but rarely to anybody else. 
Stu, da. But Stu had fancy creden- 
tials, too. 

Wolf stirred uneasily and said, 
“Oh, come, Mannie, of course we 
^ant your opinions.” 

“Don’t have any. Bonjbing plan 
was worked out carefully; every- 
body had chance to criticize. 
Haven’t seen anything to justify 
changing it.” 

P rof said, “Manuel, will you re- 
view the second bombardment 
of North America for the benefit of 
all of us?” 

“Okay. Purpose of second smear- 
ing is to force them to use up in- 
terceptor rockets. Every shot is 
aimed at a big cities — at null tar- 
gets, I mean, close to big cities. 
Which we tell them, shortly before 
we hit them. How soon, Sheenie?” 
“We’re telling them now. But we 
can change it. And should.” 

“As may be. Propaganda isn’t my 
pidgin. In most cases, to aim close 
enough to force them to interecept 



we have to use water targets. Rough 
enough. Besides killing fish and any- 
body who won’t stay off water, it 
causes tremjous local storms and 
shore damage.” 

Glanced at watch, saw I would 
have to stall. “Seattle gets one in 
Pugent Sound right in her lap. San 
Francisco is going to lose two 
bridges she’s fond of. Los Angeles 
gets one between Long Beach and 
Catalina and another a few kilom- 
eters up coast. Mexico City is in- 
land so we put one on Popocatepetl 
where they can see it. Salt Lake 
City gets one in her lake. Denver 
we ignore; they can see what’s hap- 
pening in Colorado Springs — for we 
smack Cheyenne Mountain again 
and keep it up, just as soon as we 
have it in line-of-sight. Saint Louis 
and Kansas City get shots in their 
rivers and so does New Orleans — 
probably flood New Orleans. All 
Great Lake Cities get it, a long list. 
Shall I read it?” 

“Later perhaps,” said Prof. “Go 
ahead.” 

“Boston gets one in her harbor. 
New York gets one in Long Island 
Sound and another midway between 
her two biggest bridges. Think it 
will ruin those bridges but we prom- 
ise to miss them and will. Going 
down their east coast, we give treat- 
ment to two Delaware Bay Cities, 
then two on Chesapeake Bay, one 
being of max historical and senti- 
mental importance. Farther south 
we catch three more big cities with 
sea shots. Going inland we smack 
Cincinnati, Birmingham, Chattan- 
ooga, Oklahoma City, all with river 
shots or nearby mountains. Oh, yes, 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



143 




Dallas. We destroy Dallas spaceport 
and should catch some ships, were 
six there last time I checked. Won’t 
kill any people unless they insist 
on standing on target. Dallas is per- 
fect place to bomb, that spaceport 
is big and flat and empty, yet may- 
be ten million people will see us 
hit it.” 

“If you hit it,” said Sheenie. 
“When, not ‘if.’ Each shot is 
backed up by one an hour later. If 
neither one gets through, we have 
shots farther back which can be 
diverted. For example, easy to shift 
targets among Delaware-Bay-Ches- 
apeake-Bay group. Same for Great 
Lakes group. But Dallas has its own 
string of backups and a long one — 
we expect it to be heavily defended. 
Backups run about six hours, as 
long as we can see North America 
— and last backups can be placed 
anywhere on continent . since 
farther out a load is when we divert 
it, farther we can shift it.” 

“I don’t follow that,” said Brody. 
“A matter of vectors. Judge. A 
guidance rocket can give a load so 
many meters per second of side vec- 
tor. Longer that vector has to work, 
farther from original point of aim 
load will land. If we signal a guid- 
ance rocket three hours before im- 
pact, we displace impact three times 
as much as if we waited till one 
hour before impact. Not quite that 
simple but our computer can figure 
it. If you give it time enough.” 

“How long is ‘time enough’?” 
asked Wolfgang. 

I carefully misunderstood. “Com- 
puter can solve that sort of 



problem instantaneously once you 
program it. But such decisions arc 
pre-programmed. Something like 
this: If, out of target group A, B, 
C, and D, you find that you have 
failed to hit three targets on first 
and second salvoes, you reposition 
all group-one second backups so 
that you will be able to choose those 
three targets while distributing other 
second backups of that group for 
possible use on group two while re- 
positioning third backups' — ” 

“Slow up!”. said Wolfgang. “I’m 
not a computer. I just want to know 
how long before we have to make 
up our minds.” 

“Oh.” I studied watch showily. 
“You now have . three minutes 
fifty-eight seconds in which to abort 
leading load for Kansas City. Abort 
program is set up and I have my 
best assistant — fellow named Mike 
— standing by. Shall I phone him?” 
Sheenie said, “For Heaven’s sake, 
Man — abort!” 

“Like hell!” said Finn. “What’s 
matter, Terence? No guts?” 

Prof said, “Comrades! Please!” 

I said, “Look, I take orders from 
head of state — Prof over there. If 
he wants opinions, he’ll ask. No use 
yelling at each other.” I looked at 
watch. “Call it two and a half min- 
utes. More margin, of course, for 
other targets; Kansas City is far- 
thest from deep water. But some 
Great Lake cities are already past 
ocean abort; Lake Superior is best 
we can do. Salt Lake City maybe 
an extra minute. Then they pile up.” 
I waited. 

“Roll call,” said Prof. “To carry 
out the program. General Nielsen?”

“Da!” 

“Gospazha Davis?” 

Wyoh caught breath. “Da.” 
“Judge Brody?” 

“Yes, of course. Necessary.” 
“Wolfgang?” 

“Yes.” 

“Comte LaJoie?” 

“Da.” 

“Gospodin Sheehan?” 

“You’re missing a bet. But 111 go 
along. Unanimous.” 

“One moment. Manuel?” 

“Is up to you, Prof; always has 
been. Voting is silly.” 

“I am aware that it is up to me, 
Gospodin Minister. Carry out bom- 
bardment to plan.” 

XLV 

M ost targets we managed to hit 
by second salvo though all 
were defended except Mexico City. 
Seemed likely (98.3% by Mike’s 
later calculation) that interceptors 
were exploding by radar fusing with 
set distances that incorrectly esti- 
mated vulnerability of solid cylin- 
ders of rock. Only three rocks were 
destroyed; others were pushed off 
course and thereby did more harm 
than if not fired at. 

New York was tough. Dallas turn- 
ed out to be very tough. 

Perhaps difference lay in local 
control of interception, for it 
seemed unlikely that command post 
in Cheyenne Mountain was still ef- 
fective. Perhaps we had not cracked 
their hole in the ground (don’t 
know how deep down it was) but 
I’ll bet that netiher men nor com- 
puters were still tracking. 

THE Af\OON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



Dallas blew up or pushed aside 
first five rocks, so I told Mike to 
take everything he could from Chey- 
enne Mountains and award it to 
Dallas . which he was able to do 
two salvoes later; those two targets 
are less than a thousand kilometers 
apart. 

Dallas’s defenses cracked- on next 
salvo; Mike gave their spaceport 

three more (already committed) 

then shifted back to Cheyenne 

Mountain — later ones had never 
been nudged and were still ear- 

marked “Cheyenne Mountain.” He 
was still giving that battered moun- 
tain cosmic love pats when Amer- 
ica rolled down and under Terra’s 
eastern edge. 

I stayed with Mike all during 
bombardment, knowing it would be 
our toughest. As he shut down till 
time to dust Great China, Mike 
said thoughtfully, “Man, I don’t 
think we had better hit that moun- 
tain again.” 

“Why not, Mike?” 

“It’s not there any longer.” 

“You might divert its backups. 
When do you have to decide?” 

“I put them on Albuquerque and 
Omaha but had best start now; to- 
morrow will be busy. Man my best 
friend, you should leave.” 

“Bor^ with me, pal?” 

“In the next few hours that first 
ship may launch missiles. When that 
happens I want to shift all ballistic 
control to Little David’s Sling — 
and when I do, you should be at 
Mare Undarum site.” 

“What’s fretting you, Mike?” 
“That boy is accurate, Man. But 
he’s stupid. I want him supervised. 

145 




Decisions may have to be made in 
a hurry and there isn’t anyone 
there who can program him prop- 
erly. You should be there.” 

“Okay if you say so, Mike. But 
if needs a fast program, will still 
have to phone you.” Greatest short- 
coming of computers isn’t computer 
shortcoming at all but fact that a 
human takes a long time, maybe 
hours, to set up a program that a 
computer solves in milliseconds. 
One best quality of Mike was that 
he could program himself. Fast. 
Just explain problem, let him pro- 
gram. Samewise and equally, he 
could program “idiot son” enor- 
mously faster than human could. 

“But, Man, I want you there be- 
cause you may not be able to phone 
me. The lines may be cut. So I’ve 
prepared a group of possible pro- 
grams for Junior; they may be help- 
ful.” 

“Okay, print ’em out. And let me 
talk to Prof.” 

Mike got Prof; I made sure he 
was private, then explained what 
Mike thought I should do. Thought 
Prof would object — was hoping he 
would insist I stay through coming 
bombardment/invasion whatever — 
those ships. Instead he said, “Man- 
uel, it’s essential that you go. Fvc 
hesitated to tell you. Did you discuss 
odds with Mike?” 

“Nyet.” 

“I have continued to do so. To 
put it bluntly, if Luna City is de- 
stroyed and I am dead and the rest 
of me government is dead — even if 
all Mike’s radar eyes here are blind- 
ed and he himself is cut off from 
the new catapult — all of which may 



happen under severe bombardment 
. even if all this happens at once, 
Mike still gives Luna even chances 
if Little David’s Sling can operate 
— and you are there to operate it.” 
I said, “Da, Boss. Yassuh, Mas- 
suh. You and Mike are stinkers and 
want to hog fun. Will do.” 

“Very good, Manuel.” 

S tayed with Mike another hour 
while he printed out meter af- 
ter meter of programs tailored to 
other computer — work that would 
have taken me six months even if 
able to think of all possibilities. 
Mike had it indexed and cross-ref- 
erenced — with horribles in it I hard- 
ly dare mention. Mean to say, given 
circumstances and seemed necessary 
to destroy (say) Paris, this told 
how. What missiles in what orbits, 
how to tell Junior to find them and 
bring to target. Or anything. 

Was reading this endless docu- 
ment — not programs but descrip- 
tions of purpose-of-program that 
headed each — when Wyoh phoned. 
“Mannie dear, has Prof told you 
about going to Mare Undarum?” 
“Yes. Was going to call you.” 
“All right. ni pack for us and 
meet you at Station East. When 
can you be there?” 

“Pack for ‘us’? You’re going?” 
“Didn’t Prof say?” 

“No.” Suddenly felt cheerful. 

“I felt guilty about it, dear. I 
wanted to go with you . but had 
no excuse. After all. I’m no use 
around a computer and I do have 
responsibilities here. Or did. But 
now I’ve been fired from all my jobs 
and so have you.” 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



147 




“Huh?” 

“You are no longer defense min- 
ister; Finn is. Instead you are Dep- 
uty Prime Minister — ” 

“Well!” 

“ — and Deputy Minister of De- 
fense, too. I’m already Deputy 
Speaker and Stu had been appoint- 
ed Deputy Secretary of State for 
Foreign Affairs. So he goes with 
us, too.” 

“I’m confused.” 

“It’s not as sudden as it sounds; 
Prof and Mike worked it out months 
ago. Decentralization, dear, the 
same thing that McIntyre has been 
working on for the warrens. If there 
is a disaster at L-City, Luna Free 
State still has a government. As Prof 
put it to me, ‘Wyoh dear lady, as 
long as you three and a few con- 
gressmen are left alive, all is not 
lost. You can still negotiate on equal 
terms and never admit your 
wounds.* ” 

So I wound up as a computer 
mechanic. Stu and Wyoh met me, 
with luggage (including rest of my 
arms), and we threaded through 
endless unpressured tunnels in p- 
suits, on a small flat-bed rolligon 
used to haul steel to site. Greg had 
big rolligon meet us for surface 
stretch, then met us himself when 
we went underground again. 

So I missed attack on ballistic 
radars Saturday night. 

XLVI 

C aptain of first ship, FNS Esper- 
ance, had guts. Late Saturday 
he changed course headed straight 
in. Apparently figured we might at- 



tempt jingle-jangle with radars, for 
he seems to have decided to come in 
close enough to see our radar in- 
stallations by ship’s radar rather 
than rely on letting his missiles 
home in on our beams. 

Seems to have considered himself, 
ship, and crew expendable, for he 
was down to a thousand kilometers 
before he launched, a spread that 
went straight for five out of six of 
Mike’s radars, ignoring random 
jingle-jangle. 

Mike, expecting self soon to be 
blinded, turned Brody’s boys loose 
to burn ship’s eyes, held them on 
it for three seconds before he shift- 
ed them to missiles. 

Result: one crashed cruiser, two 
ballistic radars knocked out by H- 
missiles, three missiles “killed” — 
and two gun crews killed, one by 
H-explosion, other by dead missile 
that landed square on them — plus 
thirteen gunners with radiation 
burns above 800-roentgen death 
level, partly from flash, partly from 
being on surface too long. And must 
add: Four members of Lysistrata 
Corps died with those crews; they 
elected to p-suit and go up with 
their men. Other girls had serious 
radiation exposure but not up to 
800-r level. 

Second cruiser continued an ellip- 
tical orbit around and behind Luna. 

Got most of this from Mike after 
we arrived Little David’s Sling early 
Sunday. He was feeling groused* 
over loss of two of his eyes and still 
more groused over gun crews — I 
think Mike was developing some- 
thing like human conscience; he 
seemed to feel it was his fault that 



148 



IF 




he had not been able to outfight six 
targets at once. I pointed out that 
what he had to fight with was im- 
provised, limited range, not real 
weapons. 

“How about self, Mike? Are you 
right?” 

“In all essentials. I have outlying 
discontinuities. One live missile 
chopped my circuits to Novy Lenin- 
grad, but reports routed through 
Luna City inform me that local con- 
trols tripped in satisfactorily with 
no loss in city services. I feel frus- 
trated by these discontinuities — but 
they can be dealt with later.” 

“Mike, you sound tired.” 

“Me tired? Ridiculous! Man, you 
forget what I am. I’m annoyed, 
that’s all.” 

“When will that second ship be 
back in sight?” 

“In about three hours if he were 
to hold earlier orbit. But he will not 
— probability in excess of ninety per 
cent. I expect him in about an 
hour.” 

“A Garrison orbit, huh? Oho!” 

“He left my sight at azimuth and 
course east thirty-two north. Does 
that suggest anything, Man?” 

Tried to visualize. “Suggests they 
are going to land and try to capture 
you, Mike. HaVe you told Finn? I 
mean, have you told Prof to warn 
Finn?” 

“Professor knows. But that is not 
tfie way I analyze it.” 

“So? Well, suggests I had better 
fAiut up and let you work.” 

D id so. Lenore •fetched me break- 
fast while I inspected Junior 
— and am shamed to say could not 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



manage to grieve over losses with 
both Wyoh and Lenore present. 
Mum had sent Lenore out “to cook 
for Greg” after Milla’s death — ^just 
an excuse; were enough wives at 
site to provide home-cooking for 
everybody. Was for Greg’s morale 
and Lenore’s, too; Lenore and Milla 
had been close. 

Junior seemed to be right.. He was 
working on South America, one load 
at a time. I stayed in radar room 
and watched, at extreme magnifica- 
tion, while he placed one in estuary 
between Montevideo and Buenos 
Aires; Mike could not have been 
more accurate. I then checked his 
program for North America, found 
naught to criticize — locked it in and 
took key. Junior was on his own — 
unless Mike got clear of other 
troubles and decided to take back 
control. 

Then sat and tried to listen to 
news both from Earthside and L- 
City. Co-ax cable from L-City car- 
ried phones, Mike’s hookup to his 
idiot child, radio, and video; site was 
no longer isolated. But, besides cable 
from L-City, site had antennas 
pointed at Terra; any Earthside news 
Complex could pick up, we could 
listen to directly. Nor was this silly 
extra; radio and video from Terra 
had been only recreation during 
construction and this was now a 
standby in case that one cable was 
broken. 

F.N. official satellite relay was 
claiming that Luna’s ballistic radars 
had been destroyed and that we 
were now helpless. Wondered what 
people of Buenos Aires and Monte- 
video thought about that. Probably 

149 




too busy to listen; in some ways 
water shots were worse than those 
where we could find open land. 

Luna City Lunatic* s video channel 
was carrying Sheenie telling Loonies 
outcome of attack by Esperance, re- 
peating news while warning every- 
body that battle was not over, a war- 
ship would be back in our sky any 
moment — be ready for anything, 
everybody stay in p-suits (Sheenie 
was wearing his, with helmet open), 
take maximum pressure precautions, 
all units stay on red alert, all citi- 
zens not otherwise called by duty 
strongly urged to seek lowest level 
and stay there till all clear. And so 
forth. 

He went through this several 
times — then suddenly broke it: 
“Flash! Enemy cruiser radar-sight- 
ed, low and fast. It may dido for 
Luna City. Flash! Missiles launched, 
headed for ejection end of — ** 

Picture and sound chopped off. 

Might as well tell now what we 
at Little David’s Sling learned later: 
Second cruiser, by coming in low 
and fast, tightest orbit Luna’s field 
permits, was able to start its bomb- 
ing at ejection end of old catapult, 
a hundred kilometers from catapult 
head and Brody’s gunners, and 
knock many rings out in minute it 
took him to come into si^-and- 
range of drill guns, all clustered 
around radars at catapult head. 
Guess he felt safe. Wasn’t. Brody’s 
boys -burned eyes out and ears off. 
He made one orbit after that and 
crashed near Torricelli, apparently 
m attempt to land, for his jets fired 
just before crash. 

But our next news at new site was 



from Earth ; cic; that brassy F. N. 
frequency claimed that our catapult 
had been destroyed (true) and that 
Lunar menace was ended (false) 
and called on all Loonies to take 
prisoner their false leaders and sur- 
render themselves to mercy of Fed- 
erated Nations (nonexistent — 
“mercy,” that is). 

Listened to it and checked pro- 
gramming again, and went inside 
dark radar room. If everything went 
as planned, we were about to lay 
another egg in Hudson ^River, then 
targets in succession for three hours 
across that continent — “in succes- 
sion” because junior could not 
handle simultaneous hits; Mike had 
planned accordingly. 

Hudson River was hit on sched- 
ule. Wondered how many New 
Yorkers were listening to F.N. news- 
cast while looking at spot that gave 
it lie. 

T wo hours later F.N. station was 
saying that Lunar rebels had 
had missiles in orbit when catapult 
was destroyed — but that after those 
few had impacted would be no 
more. When third bombing of North 
America was complete I shut down 
radar. Had not been running stead- 
ily; Junior was programmed to 
sneak looks only as necessary, a few 
seconds at a time. 

I then had nine hours before next 
bombing of Great China. 

But not nine hours for most ur- 
gent decision, whether to hit Great 
China again. Without information. 
Except from Terra’s news channels. 
Which might be false. Bloody. 
Without knowing whether or not 



150 



IF 




warrens had been bombed. Or Prof 
was dead or alive. Double bloody. 
Was I now acting prime minister? 
Needed Prof; “head of state” wasn’t 
my glass a chai. Above all, needed 
Mike — to calculate facts, estimate 
uncertainties, project probabilities of 
this course or that. 

My word, didn’t even know 
whether ships were headed toward 
us and, worse yet, was afraid to 
look. If turned radar on and used 
Junior for sky search, any warship 
he brushed with beams would see 
him quicker than he saw them; 
warships were built to spot radar 
surveillance. So had heard. Hell, 
was no military man; was com- 
puter technician who had bumbled 
into wrong field. 

Somebody buzzed door; 1 got up 
and unlocked. Was Wyoh, with cof- 
fee. Didn’t say a word, just handed 
it to me and went away. 

Sipped it. There it is, boy — they’re 
leaving you alone, waiting for you 
to pull miracles out of pouch. Didn’t 
feel up to it. 

From somewhere, back in my 
youth, heard Prof say, “Manuel, 
when faced with a problem you do 
not understand, do any part of it 
you do understand, then look at it 
again.” He had been teaching me 
something he» himself did not un- 
derstand very well — something in 
maths — but had taught me some- 
thing far more important, a basic 
principle. 

Knew at once what to do first. 

Went over to Junior and had him 
print out predicted impacts of all 
loads in orbit — easy, was a pre-pro- 
gram he could run anytime against 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 



real time running. While he was do- 
ing it, I looked for certain alternate 
programs in that long roll Mike had 
prepared. 

Then set up some of those alter- 
nate programs — no trouble, simply 
had to be careful to read them cor- 
rectly and punch them in without 
error. Made Junior print back for 
check before I gave him signal to 
execute. 

When finished — forty minutes — 
every load in trajectory intended for 
an inland target had been retarget- 
ed for a seacoast city — ^with hedge 
to my bet that execution was de- 
layed for rocks farther back. But, 
unless I canceled. Junior would re- 
position them as soon as need be. 

Now horrible pressure of time 
was off me, now could abort my 
load into ocean right up to last few 
minutes before impact. Now could 
think. So did. 

Then called in my “War Cab- 
inet” — Wyoh, Stu, and Greg my 
“Commander of Armed Forces,” us- 
ing Greg’s office. Lenore was al- 
lowed to go in and out, fetching 
coffee and food, or sitting and say- 
ing nothing. Lenore is a sensible 
fern and knows when to keep quiet. 

S tu started it. “Mr. Prime Minis- 
ter, I do not think that Great 
China should be hit this time.” 
“Never mind fancy titles, Stu. 
Maybe I’m acting, maybe not. But 
haven’t time for formality.” 

“Very well. May I explain my 
proposal?” 

“Later.” I explained what I had 
done to give us more time; he 
nodded and kept quiet. “Our tightest 

151 




squeeze is that we are out of com- 
munication, both Luna City and 
Earthside. Greg, how about that re- 
pair crew?” 

“Not back yet.” 

“If break is near Luna City, they 
may be gone a long time. If can 
repair at all. So must assume we’ll 
have to act on our own. Greg, do 
you have an electronics tech who 
can jury-rig a radio that will let us 
talk to Earthside? To their satellites, 
I mean — that doesn’t take much 
with right antenna. I may be able to 
help and that computer tech I sent 
you isn’t too clumsy, either.” (Quite 
good, in fact, for ordinary electron- 
ics — a poor bloke I had once false- 
ly accused of allowing a fly to get 
into Mike’s guts. I had placed him 
in this job.) 

“Harry Biggs, my power plant 
boss, can do anything of that sort,” 
Greg said thoughtfully, “if he has 
the gear.” 

“Get him on it. You can vandal- 
ize anything but radar and com- 
puter once we get all loads out of 
catapult. How many lined up?” 
“Twenty-three, and no more 
steel.” 

“So twenty-three it is, win or lose. 
I want them ready for loading; 
might lob them off today.” 

“They’re ready. We can load as 
fast as the cat can throw them.” 
“Good. One more thing — Don’t 
know whethdt there’s an F.N. cruis- 
er — maybe more than one — in our 
sky of not. And afraid to look. By 
radar, I mean; radar for skywatch 
could give away our position. But 
must have skywatch. Can you get 
volunteers for eyeball skywatch?” 



Lenore spoke up. “1 volunteer!” 

“Thanks, honey; you’re accept- 
ed.” 

“We’ll find them,” said Greg. 
“Won’t need ferns.” 

“Let her do it, Greg; this is ev- 
erybody’s show.” Explained what I 
wanted: Mare Undarum was now in 
dark semi-lunar; Sun had set. In- 
visible boundary between sunlight 
and Luna’s shadow stretched over 
us, a precise locus. Ships passing 
through our sky would wink sudden- 
ly into view going west,, blink out 
going east. Visible part of orbit 
would stretch from horizon to some 
point in sky. If eyeball team could 
spot both points, mark one by bear- 
ing, other by stars, and approximate 
time by counting seconds. Junior 
could start guessing orbit — two pass- 
es and Junior would know its period 
and something about shape of orbit. 
Then I would have some notion of 
when would be safe to use radar and 
radio, and catapult — did not want 
to loose a load with F.N. ship above 
horizon, could be radar-looking our 
way. 

Perhaps too cautious — but had to 
assume that this catapult, this one 
radar, these two dozen missiles, were 
all that stood between Luna and 
total defeat — and our bluff hinged 
on them never knowing what we had 
or where it was. We had to appear 
endlessly able to pound Terra with 
missiles, from source they had not 
suspected and could never find. 

Then as now, most Loonies knew 
nothing about astronomy — ^we’re 

cave dwellers, we go up to surface 
only when necessary. But we were 
lucky; was amateur astronomer

IF 




in Greg’s crew, cobber who had 
worked at Ridiardson. I explained, 
put him in charge, let him worry 
about teaching eyeball crew how to 
tell stars apart. I got these things 
started before we went back to talk- 
talk. “Well, Stu? Why shouldn’t we 
hit Great China?” 

“I’m still expecting word from 
Dr. Chan. I received one message 
from him, phoned here shortly be- 
fore we were cut off from cities — ” 

4 4 ]VTy word, why didn’t you tell 
IVl me?” 

“I tried to, but you had yourself 
locked in and I know better than to 
bother you when you are busy with 
ballistics. Here’s the translation. Us- 
ual LuNoHo Company address with 
a reference which means it’s for me 
and that it has come through by 
Paris agent. ‘Our Darwin sales rep- 
resentative’ — that’s Chan — ‘informs 
us that your shipments of — well, 
never mind the coding; he means 
the attack days while appearing to 
refer to last June — ‘were improperly 
packaged resulting in unacceptable 
damage. Unless this can be correct- 
ed, negotiations for long-term con- 
tract will be seriously jeopardized.’ ” 
Stu looked up. “All doubletalk. 
I take it to mean that Dr. Chan feels 
that he has his 'government ready to 
talk terms . but that we should 
let up on bombing Great China or 
we may upset his apple cart,” 
“Hmm — ” Got up and walked 
around. Ask Wyoh’s opinion? No- 
body knew Wyoh’s virtues better 
than I . but she oscillated be- 
tween fierceness and too-human 
compassion — and I had learned al- 



ready that a “head of state,” even 
an acting one, must have neither. 
Ask Greg? Greg was a good farm- 
er, a better mechanic, a rousing 
preacher; I loved him dearly — but 
did not want his opinion. Stu? I had 
had his opinion. 

Or did I? “Stu, what’s your opin- 
ion? Not Chan’s opinion — ^but your 
own.** 

Stu looked thoughtful. “That’s dif- 
ficult, Mannie. I am not Chinese, 
I have not spent much time in Great 
China, and can’t claim to be expert 
in their politics nor their psychol- 
ogy. So I’m forced to depend on his 
opinion.” 

“Uh — Damn it, he’s not a Loonie! 
His purposes are not our purposes. 
What does he expect to get out of 
it?” 

“I think he is maneuvering for a 
monopoly over Lunar trade. Perhaps 
bases here, too. Possibly an extra- 
territorial enclave. Not that we 
would grant that.” 

“Might if we were hurtin’.” 

“He didn’t say any of this. He 
doesn’t say much, you know. He 
listens.” 

‘Too well I know.” Worried at it, 
more bothered each minute. 

News from Earthside had been 
droning in background; I had asked 
Wyoh to monitor while I was busy 
with Greg. “Wyoh hon, anything 
new from Earthside?” 

44X70. The same claims. We’ve 
been utterly . defeated and 
our surrender is expected momen- 
tarily. Oh, there’s a warning that 
some missiles are still in space, fall- 
ing out of control, but with it a 



THE MOON ^S A HARSH AlUSTRESS 



153 




reassurance that the paths are being 
analyzed and people will be warned 
in time to avoid impact areas.” 
“Anything to suggest that Prof — 
or anybody in Luna City, or any- 
where in Luna — is in touch with 
Earthside?” 

“Nothing at all.” 

“Damn. Anything from Great 
China?” 

“No. Comments from almost ev- 
erywhere else. But not from Great 
China.” 

“Uh — ” Stepped to door. “Greg! 
Hey, cobber, see if you can find 
Greg Davis. I need him.” 

Closed door. “Stu, we’re not go- 
ing to let Great China off.” 

“So?” 

“No. Would be nice if Great 
China busted alliance against us; 
might save us some damage. But 
we’ve got this far only by appearing 
able to hit them at will and to de- 
stroy any ship they send against us. 
At least I hope that last one was 
burned and we’ve certainly clob- 
bered eight out of nine. We won’t 
get anywhere by looking weak, not 
while F.N. is claiming that we are 
not just weak but finished. Instead 
we must hand them surprises. Start- 
ing with Great China and if it 
makes Dr. Chan unhappy, we’ll give 
him a kerchief to weep into. If we 
can go on looking strong — when 
F.N. says we’re licked — then even- 
tually some veto power is going to 
crack. If not Great China, then 
some other one.” 

Stu bowed without getting up. 
“Very well, sir.” 

“I — ” Greg came in. “You want 
me, Mannie?” 



“What makes with Earthside send- 
er?” 

“Harry says you can have it by 
tomorrow. A crumby rig, he says, 
but push watts through it and will 
be heard.” 

“Power we got. And if he says 
‘tomorrow’ then he knows what he 
wants to build. So will be today — 
say six hours. I’ll work under him. 
Wyoh hon, will you get my arms? 
Want number six and number three 
— better bring number five, too. 
And you stick with me' and change 
arms for me. Stu, want you to write 
some narsty messages — I’ll give you 
general idea and you put acid in 
them. Greg, we are not going to get 
all those rocks into space at once. 
Ones we have in space now will im- 
pact in next eighteen, nineteen 
hours. Then, when F.N. is announc- 
ing that all rocks are accounted for 
and Lunar menace is over ... we 
crash into their newscast and warn 
of next bombings. Shortest possible 
orbits, Greg, ten hours or less — so 
check everything on catapult and H- 
plant and controls; with that extra 
boost all has to be dead on.” 

Wyoh was back with arms; I told 
her “number six” and added, 
“Greg, let me talk with Harry.”

S ix hours later sender was ready 
to beam toward Terra. Was ugly 
job. vandalized mainly out of a re- 
sonance prospector used in project’s 
early stages. But could ride an audio 
signal on its radio frequency and 
was powerful. Stu’s narstified ver- 
sions of my warnings had been

IF 




taped and Harry was ready to zip- 
squeal them — all Terran satellites 
could accept high speed at sixty-to- 
one and had no wish to have our 
sender heated more seconds than 
necessary; eyeball watch had con- 
firmed fears: At least two ships 
were in orbit around Luna. 

So we told Great China that her 
major coastal cities would each re- 
ceive a Lunar present offset ten kil- 
ometers into ocean — Pusan, Tsing- 
tao, Taip>ei, Shanghai, Saigon, Bang- 
kok, Singapore, Djakarta, Darwin, 
and so forth — except that Old Hong 
Kong would get one smack on top 
of F.N.’s Far East offices, so kind- 
ly have all human beings move far 
back. Stu noted that human beings 
did not mean F.N. personnel; they 
were urged to stay at desks. 

India was given similar warnings 
about coastal cities and was told 
that F.N. global offices would be 
spared one more rotation out of 
respect for cultural monuments in 
Agra — and to permit human beings 
to evacuate. (I intended to extend 
this by another rotation as deadline 
approached out of respect for Prof. 
And then another, indefinitely. 
Damn it, they would build their 
home offices next door to most 
overdecorated tomb ever built. But 
one that Prof treasured.) 

Rest of world was told to keep 
their seats; game was going extra 
innings. But stay away from any 
F.N. offices anywhere; we were 
frothing at mouth and no F.N. of- 
fice was safe. Better yet, get out of 
any city containing an F.N. head- 
quarters — but F.N. vips and finks 
were urged to sit tight. 



Then spent next twenty hours 
coaching junior into sneaking his 
radar peeks when our sky was clear 
of ships, or believed to be. Napped 
when I could and Lenore stayed 
with me and woke me in time for 
next coaching. And that ended 
Mike’s rocks and we all went into 
alert while we got first of Junior’s 
rocks flung high and fast. Waited 
until certain it had gone hot and 
true — then told Terra where to look 
for it and where and when ^o ex- 
pect it, so that all would know that 
F.N.’s claims of victory were on a 
par with their century of lies about 
Luna — all in Stu’s best, snotty, su- 
percilious phrases delivered in his 
cultured accents. 

First one should have been Great 
China but was one piece of North 
American Directorate we could 
reach with it — her proudest jewel, 
Hawaii. Junior placed it in triangle 
formed by Maui, Molokai, and 
Lanai. I didn’t work out program- 
ming; Mike had anticipated every- 
thing. 

Then pronto we got off ten more 
rocks at short intervals (had to skip 
one program, a ship in our sky) 
and told Great China where to look 
and when to expect them and where 
— coastal cities we had neglected 
day before. 

Was down to twelve rocks but de- 
cided was safer to run out of am- 
munition than to look as if we were 
running out. So I awarded seven to 
Indian coastal cities, picking new 
targets — and Stu inquired sweetly if 
Agra had been evacuated. If not, 
please tell us at once, (But heaved 
no rock at it.) 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

Egypt was told to clear shipping 
out of Suez Canal — bluff; was 
hoarding last five rocks. 

Then waited. 

I mpact at Lahaina Roads, that tar- 
get in Hawaii. Looked good at 
high mag; Mike could be proud of 
Junior. 

And waited. 

Thirty-seven minutes before first 
China Coast impact Great China de- 
nounced actions of F.N., recognized 
us, offered to negotiate — and I 
sprained a finger punching abort 
buttons. 

Then was punching buttons with 
sore finger; India stumbled over feet 
following suit. 

Egypt recognized us. Other na- 
tions started scrambling for door. 

Stu informed Terra that we had 
suspended — only suspended, not 
stopped — bombardments. Now get 
those ships out of our sky at once — 
NOW! — and we could talk. If they 
could not get home without refilling 
tanks, let them land not less than 
fifty kilometers from any mapped 
warren, then wait for their surrender 
to be accepted. But clear our sky 
NOW! 

This ultimatum we delayed a few 
minutes to let a ship pass beyond 
horizon; we weren’t taking chances 
— one missile and Luna would have 
been helpless. 

And waited. 

Cable crew returned. Had gone 
almost to Luna City, found break. 
But thousands of tonnes of loose 
rock impeded repair, so they had 
done what they could — gone bade 
to a spot where they could get 



through to surface, erected a tem- 
porary relay in direction they thought 
Luna City lay, sent up a dozen rock- 
ets at ten-minute intervals, and hop- 
ed that somebody would see, under- 
stand, aim a relay at it — any com- 
munication? 

No. 

Waited. 

Eyeball squad reported that a ship 
which had been clock faithful for 
nineteen passes had failed to show. 
Ten minutes later they reported that 
another ship had missed ' expected 
appearance. 

We waited and listened. 

Great China, speaking on behalf 
of all veto powers, accepted armi- 
stice and stated that our sky was 
now clear. Lenore burst into tears 
and kissed everybody she could 
reach. 

After we steadied down (a man 
can’t think when women are grab- 
bing him, especially when five of 
them are not his wives) — a few 
minutes later, when we were coher- 
ent, I said, “Stu, want you to leave 
for Luna City at once. Pick your 
party. No women — you’ll have to 
walk surface last kilometers. Find 
out what’s going on — but first get 
them to aim a relay at ours and 
phone me.” 

“Very good, sir.” 

We were getting him outfitted for 
a tough journey — extra air bottles, 
emergency shelter, so forth — when 
Earthside called me ... on frequen- 
ey we were listening to because mes- 
sage was (learned later) on all fre- 
quencies up from Earthside: 

**Private message. Prof to Mannie 
— identification, birthday Bastille 



156 



IF 




and Sherlock*s sibling. Come home 
at once. Your carriage waits at your 
new relay. Private message, Prof 
to — ” 

And went on repeating. 

“Harry!” 

“Da, Boss?” 

“Message Earthside — tape and 
squeal; we still don’t want them 
ringing us. ^'Private message, Man- 
nie to Prof. Brass Cannon. On my 
way!* Ask them to acknowledge — 
but use only one squeal.” 

XL VIII 

S tu and Greg drove on way back, 
while Wyoh and Lenore and 1 
huddled on open flatbed, strapped 
to keep from falling off; was too 
small. Had time to think; neither girl 
had suit radio and we could talk 
only by helmet touch — awkward. 

Began to see — now that we had 
won — parts of Prof’s plan that had 
never been clear to me. Inviting at- 
tack against catapult had spared 
warrens — hoped it had; that was 
plan — but Prof had always been 
cheerfully indifferent to damage to 
catapult. Sure, had a second one — 
but far away and difficult to reach. 
Would take years to put a tube sys- 
tem to new catapult, high mountains 
all way. Probably cheaper to repair 
old one. If possible. 

Either way, no grain shipped to 
Terra in meantime. 

And that was just whqt Prof want- 
ed! Yet never once had he hinted 
that his plan was based on destroy- 
ing old catapult — his long-range 
plan, not just Revolution. He might 
not admit it now. But Mike would 



tell me — if put to him flatly: Was 
or was not this one factor in odds? 
Food riot predictions and all that, 
Mike? He would tell me. 

That tonne-for-tonne deal — Prof 
had expounded it Earthside — had 
been argument for a Terran catapult. 
But privately he had no enthusiasm 
for it. Once he had told me, in North 
America, “Yes, Manuel, I fed sure 
it would work. But, if built, it will be 
temporary. There was *a time, two 
centuries ago, when dirty laundry 
used to be shipped from California 
to Hawaii — by sailing ship, mind 
you — and clean laundry returned. 
Special circumstances. If we ever 
see water and manure shipped to 
Luna and grain shipped back, it will 
be just as temporary. Luna’s future 
lies in her unique position at the top 
of a gravity well over a rich planet, 
and in her cheap power and plenti- 
ful real estate. If we Loonies have 
sense enough in the centuries ahead 
to remain a free port and to stay out 
of entangling alliances, we will be- 
come the crossroads for two planets, 
three planets, the entire Solar Sys- 
tem. We won’t be farmers forever.” 
They met us at Station East and 
hardly gave time to get p-suits off — 
was return from Earthside over 
again, screaming mobs and being rid- 
den on shoulders. Even girls, for 
Slim Lemke.said to Lenore, “May 
we carry you, too?” — and Wyoh 
answered, “Sure, why not?” 

Most men were pressure-suited 
and I was surprised to see how many 
carried guns — until I saw that they 
were not our guns; they were cap- 
tured. But most of all what bless^ 
relief to see L-City unhurt! 



THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

C ould have done without trium- 
phal procession; was itching to 
get to phone and find out from 
Mike what had happened — how 
much damage, how many killed, 
what this victory cost. But no chance. 
We were carried to Old Dome willy- 
nilly. 

They shoved us up on a platform 
with Prof and rest of Cabinet and 
vips and such, and our girls slob- 
bered on Prof and he embraced me 
Latin style, kiss cheek, and some- 
body stuck a Liberty Cap on me. 
Spotted little Hazel in crowd and 
threw her a kiss. 

At last they quieted enough for 
Prof to speak. 

“My friends,” he said, and wait- 
ed for silence. “My friends,” he re- 
peated softly. “Beloved comrades. 
We meet at last in freedom and 
now have with us the heroes who 
fought the last battle for Luna, 
alone.” They cheered us, again he 
waited. Could see he was tired; 
hands trembled as he steadied self 
against pulpit. “I want them to speak 
to you, we want to hear about it, 
all of us. 

“But first I have a happy mes- 
sage. Great China has just announc- 
ed that she is building in the Hima- 
layas an enormous catapult, to make 
shipping to Luna as easy and cheap 
as it has been to ship from Luna 
to Terra.” 

He stopped f6r cheers, then went 
on, “But that lies in the future. To- 
day — Oh, happy day! At last the 
world acknowledges Luna’s sover- 
eignty. Free! You have won your 
freedom — ” 

Prof stopped — looked surprised. 



Not afraid, but puzzled. Swayed 
slightly. 

Then he did die. 

XLIX 

W e got him into a shop behind 
platform. But even with help 
of a dozen doctors was no use; old 
heart was gone, strained too many 
times. They carried him out back 
way and I started to follow. 

Stu touched my arm. “Mr. Prime 
Minister — ” 

I said, “Huh? Oh, for Bog’s sake!” 
“Mr. Prime Minister,” he repeat- 
ed firmly, “you must speak to the 
crowd, send them home. Then there 
are things that must be done.” He 
spoke calmly but tears poured down 
cheeks. 

So I got back on platform and 
confirmed what they had guessed 
and told them to go home. And 
wound up in room L of Raffles, 
where all had started — emergency 
Cabinet meeting. But first ducked to 
phone, lowered hood, punched MY- 
CROFTXXX. 

Got null-number signal. Tried 
again — same. Pushed up hood and 
said to man nearest me, Wolfgang, 
“Aren’t phones working?” 

“Depends,” he said. “That bomb- 
ing yesterday shook things up. If 
you want an out-of-town number, 
better call the phone office.” 

Could see self asking office to get 
me a null. “What bombing?” 

“Haven’t you heard? It was con- 
centrated on the Complex. But 
Brody’s boys got the ship. No real 
damage. Nothing that can’t be fix- 
ed.” 



158 



IF 




Had to drop it; they were wait- 
ing. / didn’t know what to do but 
Stu and Korsakov did. Sheenie was 
told to write news releases for Terra 
and rest of Luna; I found self an- 
nouncing a lunar of mourning, twen- 
ty-four hours of quiet, no unneces- 
sary business, giving orders for body 
to lie in state — all words put into 
mouth, I was numb, brain would not 
work. Okay, convene Congress at 
end of twenty-four hours. In Novy- 
len? Okay. 

Sheenie had despatches from 
Earthside. Wolfgang wrote for me 
something which said that, because 
of death of our President, answers 
would be delayed at least twenty- 
four hours. 

At last was able to get away, with 
Wyoh. A stilyagi guard kept people 
away from us to easement lock thir- 
teen. Once home I ducked into work- 
shop on pretence of needing to 
change arms. “Mike?” 

No answer. 

S o tried punching his combo into 
house phone — null signal. Re- 
solved to go out to Complex next 
day — with Prof gone, needed Mike 
worse than ever. 

But next day was not able to go; 
trans-Cri^ium tube was out — that 
last bombing. You could go around 
through Torricelli and Novylen and 
eventually reach Hong Kong. But 
Complex, almost next door, could 
be reached only by rolligon. Couldn’t 
take time; I was “government.” 
Managed to shuck that off two 
days later. By resolution was decided 
that Speaker (Finn) had succeeded 
to Presidency, after Finn and I had 



decided that Wolfgang was best 
choice for Prime Minister. We put 
it through and I went back to being 
congressman who didn’t attend ses- 
sions. 

By then most phones were work- 
ing and Complex could be called. 
Punched MYCROFTXXX. No an- 
swer — So went out by rolligon. Had 
to go down and walk tube last kilo- 
meter but Complex ’Under didn’t 
seem hurt. 

Nor did Mike appear to be. 

But when I spoke to him, he didn’t 
answer. 

He has never answered. Has been 
many years now. 

You can type questions into him 
— in Loglan — and you’ll get Log- 
lan answers out. He works just fine 
... as a computer. But won’t talK 
Or can’t. 

Wyoh tried to coax him. Then she 
stopped. Eventually I stopped. 

Don’t know how it happened. 
Many outlying pieces of him got 
chopped off in last bombing — was 
meant, I’m sure, to kill our ballistic 
computer. Did he fall below that 
“critical number” it takes to sustain 
self-awareness? (If is such; was never 
more than hypothesis.) Or did de- 
centralizing that was done before 
that last bombing “kill” him? 

/ don’t know. If was just a mat- 
ter of critical number, well, hrt long 
been repaired; he must be back up 
to it. Why doesn’t he wake up? 

Can a machine be so frightened 
and hurt that it will go into cata- 
tonia and refuse to respond? While 
ego crouches inside, aware but nev- 
er willing to risk it? No, can't be 
that; Mike was unafraid.

Y ears, changes — Mimi long ago 
opted out of family manage- 
ment; Anna is “Mum” now and 
Mimi dreams by video. Slim got 
Hazel to change name to Stone, two 
kids and she studied engineering. All 
those new free-fall drugs and now- 
days earthworms stay three or four 
years and go home unchanged. And 
those other drugs that do almost as 
much for us; some kids go Earthside 
to school now. And Tibet catapult — 
took seventeen years instead of ten; 
Kilimanjaro job was finished soon- 
er. 

One mild surprise — when time 
came, Lenore named Stu for opting, 
rather than Wyoh. Made no differ- 
ence, we all voted “Da!” One thing 
not a surprise because Wyoh and I 
pushed it through during time we 
still amounted to something in gov- 
ernment: A brass cannon on a ped- 
estal in middle of Old Dome and 
over it a flag fluttering in blower 
breeze — black field speckled with 
stars, bar sinister in blood, a proud 
and jaunty brass cannon embroider- 
ed over all, and below it our motto: 
“Tanstaafl!” That’s where we hold 
our Fourth-of-July celebrations. 

You get only what you pay for 
— Prof knew and paid, gaily. 

But Prof underrated yammer- 
heads. They never adopted any of 
his ideas. Seems to be a deep in- 
stinct in human beings for making 
everything compulsory that isn’t for- 
bidden. Prof got fascinated by pos- 
sibilities for shaping future that lay 



in a big, smart computer — and lost 
track of things closer home. Oh, I 
backed him! But now I wonder. Are 
food riots too high a price to pay to 
let people be? I don’t know. 

Don’t know any answers, come 
right down to it. 

Wish I could ask Mike. 

I wake up in night and think I’ve 
heard him — just a whisper: “Man 
. Man my best friend — ” But 
when I say, “Mike?” he doesn’t an- 
swer. Is he wandering around some- 
where, looking for hardware to hook 
onto? Or is he buried down in Com- 
plex Under, trying to find way out? 
Those special memories are all in 
there somewhere, waiting to be stir- 
red. But I can’t retrieve them; they 
were voice-coded. 

Oh, he’s dead as Prof, I know it. 
(But how dead is Prof?) If I punch- 
ed it just once more and said, “Hi, 
Mike!” would he answer, “Hi, Man! 
Heard any good ones lately?” Been 
a long time since I’ve risked it. But 
he can’t really be dead; nothing was 
hurt — he’s just lost. 

You listening. Bog? Is a comput- 
er one of Your creatures? 

'TVx) many changes — May go to 
A that talk-talk tonight and tass 
in some random numbers. 

Or not. Since Boom started quite 
a few young cobbers have gone out 
lo Asteroids. Hear about some nice 
places out there, not too crowded. 

My word. I’m not even a hundred 
yet. END

Dear Editor: 

I have just finished reading the 
letter by D. Bruce Berry in ‘‘Hue 
and Cry’^ of the October issue of 
If. I have been reading science fic- 
tion for many years and was not 
too surprised to find out that I am 
not (by Mr. Berry ^s description) a 
normal-general-public-type reader. 
I always read first the editorial 
then letters-to-the-editor before go- 
ing on the body of the magazine, al- 
though I have never written such a 
letter, myself, before. For your in- 
formation, I like a digest-size mag- 
azine and hope you don^t change it. 
It fits easily into coat pocket, purse 
or glove compartment; I can take it 
anywhere, everywhere and always 
be sure of good reading on hand. 
Also, it can easily be held in one 
hand; I like to read while eating. 
As for the covers: I am attracted 
by art. rf the colors and form are 
artistically beautiful, I am attract- 
ed whether the subject matter is 
monsters, scenery or geometric 
form. Please don't shorten the ed- 
itorials, I do enjoy them. — Irene

Dear Editor: 

A good example of physical 



sciences finally catching up with 
science fiction is shown in the Eng- 
lish science journal NaturCy Vol. 
206, No. 4987, pp. 861-865, May 29, 
1965. 

The title of this paper is Possible 
Anti-Matter Content of the Tun- 
ffuska Meteor of 1908 by Prof. C. 
Cowan, C.R. Atlurl and Prof. W.P\ 
Libby — a Nobel Prize winner. 

This “meteor” — sic — ^has been at- 
tributed to: 

1. A meteor, 

2. A small comet, 

3. A nuclear explosion of some 
sort!, and now to anti-matter an- 
nihilation. 

The first three of these are ruled 
out for various reasons and ijhe anti- 
matter model seems to fit the ob- 
served perimeters for the explosion, 
although anti-matter has never been 
observed on earth. 

I am sure that anti-matter or its 
equivalent has been used as a bomb 
or some thing in past — very past — 
science fiction stories. No one seems 
to be laughing at this idea or sug- 
gesting the authors see a “head 
shrinker” or WORSE! It gives one 
something to ponder, doesn't it? —

Dear Editor: 

Concerning a letter from Linda 
Leach in your Jan. '66 issue: The 
story she is interested in is The 
Arena by Fredric Brown, first 
printed in Astounding June 1944, 
also reprinted in a Groff Conklin 
anthology: The Big Book of S.F, 
published by Crown. In this short 
piece Mr. Brown commands the 
readers' participation with his use 
of excellent sensory illusions, some- 
what like setting a Morrow cover to 
words. Many other writers make 
i^ood use of this technique, among 
which Philip Jose Farmer is a 
II rime example. I especially enjoyed 
his Day of The Ghreat Shout 

If Galaxy pubs, will continue to 
print fiction <rf ttiat quality, there 
will never be need to worry about 
readership following. Only in this 
\vay will S.F. insure its rightful 
place in literature, although I ex- 
pect the snubbing by the ‘‘Ivory 
Tower” contemporary critics will 
continue forever. 

But why single out S.F. for such 
unwarranted criticism? Because it 
generally smacks of fantasy? Stein- 
beck, Ustinov, Poe — even Shakes- 
peare and countless others wrote 
fantasies at one time or another. 
They were of the supernatural in- 
stead of the science variety, but, as 
they say, it's the same difference. 
Well then, maybe S.F. is too spec- 
ialized or too “far ou\”? Hardly a 
basis for criticism. For instance: 
Murder, mysteries and detective fic- 
tion are surely highly specialized 
and nothing could be farther out 
than the recent rash of “super-spy” 
stories. Yet I haven't heard the crit- 
ics taking pot-shots at these fields. 

I'm sure that you, Mr. Pohl, and 
your contemporaries bat these, and 
many other arguments around with 

162 



the literary magnates. And I'm 
equally sure that they just smile 
condescendingly and decide to ig- 
nore nuts like you. Now isn't it 
true that S.F. is just hokey stuff 
like Buck Rogers and horrible mon- 
sters? (Critics must be rabid fans 
of the comics and low budget mo- 
tion pictures.) That is what they 
think but we knew better, don't we? 

Incidentally, I have one final 
question : What ever happened to 
Walter M. Miller Jr? — L.E. Don- 
ahue, 6811 Jeff Davis Pike, Apt. 51, 
Richmond 34, Va. 23234. 

# Re Walter Miller, we don't know 
— ^but if anyone does, we'd like to 
hear. Re critics taking pot-shots at 
science fiction, this seems to be the 
nature of the beast. Not all critics; 
and not really at science fiction 
(because they happily love science- 
fiction stories that aren't labeled 
science fiction, like The Child Buyer 
and 19 8 A,) \^at tiiey oppose, it 
seems, is their own construct of 
what “science fiction” is like, pre- 
sumably because they once saw The 
Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, didn't 
like it, and assume sf has nothing 
else to offer. Well, it's their loss, 
poor wretdhes! 

Meanwhile, looks like that fills us 
up for another month. Our “first” 
this month is Garrett Brown. Hope 
you'll be with us again, for more of 
Earthblofod (since the Heinledn serial 
had to stop sometime, we're delight- 
ed we had something like Earth- 
blood to follow it up with!) and for 
the other stories coming up. 

By the way, we just bought a new 
one from James Blish. Tentative 
title is To Mars by Treehouse, and 
it's a good one!

Could you write 
for television? 

By Max Shulman 



X rankly, I don’t know. But this I do know: 
when I was running the Dobie Gillis show, 
I often paid $2,500 and more for scripts 
turned out by people who should have been 
arrested for impersonating writers. 

How such people got to be high-priced 
TV writers is not as mysterious as it seems. 
Television is an insatiable maw into which 
scripts must be fed at a rate unprecedented 
in the history of entertainment. It is a grate- 
ful producer indeed who consistently gets 
scripts which have been written with real 
understanding of television’s powers and 
limitations. 

To help train new TV writers, I joined 
with Rod Serling (creator of The Twilight 
Zone, winner of five Emmy Awards) and 
ten other leading authors* to start the 
Famous Writers School. We pooled every- 
thing we had learned in our long years in the 
business to devise four professional writing 
courses that men and women, seriously in- 
terested in writing, could take in their own 
homes in their free time.

quick, visual sequences . the knack of 
thinking and writing with a lens! 

Through a series of carefully planned 
assignments, you learn as you write— guided 
by our own specially organized textbooks. 
Your assignments are painstakingly edited 
and revised by our staff of instructors, them- 
selves all professional writers. Under our 
supervision, an instructor works with you 
by mail, much as a producer or editor works 
with an established writer. 

Do you have an aptitude for writing? 

To help you (and us) decide whether you’ve 
got the stuff to be a writer, we have worked 
up a revealing aptitude test. The coupon 
below will bring you a copy, along with a 
48-page School brochure. If your test indi- 
cates aptitude, you are eligible to enroll in 
the School. You are, however, under no ob- 
ligation to do so. 



How to write “with a lens” 

All four of our courses give you a solid 
foundation in basic writing skills. And three 
of them (Fiction, Non-Fiction and Adver- 
tising)- give you training in the techniques 
of television. You learn to build interesting, 
believable characters; how to write dialogue 
that rings true; how to plot convincingly. 
Therf you develop the specialized approach 
that TV demands: the facility to tell your
