METEOROLOGICAL ROCKET APPROACHES SUN— The sun, 864,000 miles 
in diameter and 93,000,000 miles from Earth, has a temperature of 1 1,000 
degrees Fahrenheit. The prominence spurting off the sun is a fiery tongue of 
hydrogen gas rising thousands of miles above the surface and traveling 
100,000 miles per hour. The "pock marks" are sun spots, gigantic storm 
areas much cooler (relatively speaking) than the sun's surface. These sun 
spots, or storms, have considerable effect on the Earth, causing northern lights, 
radio disturbances and magnetic storms.

FREE SAMPLE LESSON 



you’re that man, here’s something that will 
interest you. 

Not a magic formula — not a get-rich-quick 
scheme — but something more substantial, more 
practical. 

Of course, you need something more than just 
the desire to be an accountant. You've got to pay 
the price — be willing to study earnestly, thoroughly. 

Still, wouldn’t it be worth your while to sacri- 
fice some of your leisure in favor of interesting 
home study — over a comparatively brief period? 
Always provided that the rewards were good — a 
salary of $4,000 to $10,000? 

An accountant's duties are interesting, varied 
and of real worth to his employers. He ha s standing! 

Do you feel that such things aren’t for you? 
Well, don’t be too sure. Very possibly they can be! 

Why not, like so many before you, investigate 
LaSalle's modern Problem Method of training for 
an accountancy, position? 

Just suppose you were permitted to work in a 
large accounting house under the personal super- 
vision of an expert accountant. Suppose, with his 
aid. you studied accounting principles and solved 
problems day by day — easy ones at first — then 
more difficult ones. If you could do this — and 
could turn to him for advice as the problems be- 
came complex — soon you’d master them all. 

That’s the training you follow in principle un- 
der the LaSalle Problem Method. 

You cover accountancy from the basic Prin- 
ciples right up through Accountancy Systems and 
Income Tax Procedure. Then you add C. P. A. 
Training and psepare for the C. P. A. examina- 
tions. 

As you go along, you absorb the principles of 
Auditing, Cost Accounting, Business Law, Sta- 



tistical Control, Organization, Management and 
Finance. 

Your progress is as speedy as you care to make 
it— depending on your own eagerness to learn 
and the time you spend in study. 

Will recognition come? The only answer, as 
you know, is that success dm come to the man 
who is really trained. It’s possible your employers 
will notice your improvement in a very few weeks 
or months. Indeed, many LaSalle graduates have 
paid for their training — with increased earnings 
— before they have completed it! For accountants, 
who are trained in organization and management, 
are the executives of the future.

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told— things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some— but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws— 
their amazing discoveries of the hid - 
den processes of man's mind, and the 
mastery of life's problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

The Rosicrucians (not a religious

wisdom in their archives for centu- 
ries. They now invite you to share the

A CHAT WITH 
THE EDITOR 

NOBODY SEEMS to know what 
constitutes the ultimate in govern- 
ment or in a civilization. If it is 
Utopia — which is a dream or it 
wouldn’t be called Utopia — in 
which direction is the logical ap- 
proach? Better, let’s say in which 
direction does the best “experimen- 
tal approach” lie? For there is no 
logical approach to a dream, as 
logic goes. 

One of the “experimental” ave- 
nues is suggested by some of the 
science fiction stories which come 
into this office . and that is se- 
lective breeding. Some of these are 
rather convincing: If selective 

breeding with cattle or chickens or 
race horses or pigs or vegetables 
or something is so successful, why 
can’t it be so with human beings? 

Right off the bat, selective breed- 
ing of human beings, as a predica- 
tion for producing mentally superior 
people, is impossible. And even if 
it wasn’t impossible, it wouldn’t 
make a nation or a civilization. Bi- 



ologically speaking, when you se- 
lect a special male and a special 
female for breeding purposes, there 
isn’t one chance in a billion that 
you are going to get offspring ex- 
actly like either one, or a combi- 
nation of the two. Physical char- 
acteristics might well be similar, 
but getting one hundred per cent 
duplication of talent, aptitude or 
personality is as remote as that of 
planets in different galaxies collid- 
ing. There are 48 chromosomes 
which determine the characteristics 
of the offspring, 24 contributed by 
the male, 24 by the female, and 
each chromosome contains 100 
genes. These 4800 genes are mixed 
up like balls in a huge lottery drum. 
Now take your pick, as you would 
a hand of bridge — and see how 
many different combinations there 
are! Only a few trillion. 

Come to think of it, race horses 
are selectively bred and they have 
the brains of a mouse . and the 
champion does not always sire 
champions. 

Anyway, genius and brains are 
not hereditary. Some of the best 
brains have been known to produce 
morons. Besides, fine minds and 
genius are rather delicate mechan- 
isms; they break faster and more 
easily, unable to stand the stress 
and strain. Nor does the mating of 
low mentality necessarily produce 
low mentality. Some of the finest 
minds in history have sprung from 
mediocre parentage. Mating math- 
ematicians or engineers or doctors 
doesn’t mean you’re going to get a 
doctor or an engineer or a math- 
ematician anymore than if you 
mated a deep sea diver and a female 
lion tamer. 

When selectivity has been tried 



4 



on social lines — and the practise of 
royalty is a prime example — in- 
breeding is the most outstanding 
result, with some rather startling 
and undesirable traits becoming 
dominant. Consider for a moment 
the deranged monarchs who have 
at one time or another ruled almost 
every nation in Europe or Asia. It 
was the new blood of the lusty 
“lower class” women who bore 
illegitimate heirs to the various 
thrones which was often responsible 
for rejuvenating the royal lineage 
when it tottered on the brink of 
idiocy. 

But for argument’s sake, assume 
that selective breeding would work 
and you could produce that par- 
ticular talent which the state of 
the nation seemed to require. 
Would that pump the right kind 
of blood into the national veins? 
Hardly. It takes more than selective 
breeding alone. There is a matter 
of environmental control, and of 
education of the selectivity bred, 
which would have to be a rigidly 
controlled routine to breed out in- 
dividual enterprise, in order that 
such control could be maintained. 
Yet, the prime characteristic of 
the talented individual or the gen- 
ius is individuality. Becomes rather 
a vicious circle, doesn’t it? 

The United States, which is just 
about the only first rate power left 
in the world today, grew to such 
stature in the shortest time that a 
nation has ever attained world su- 
premacy — because it was anything 
but selectively bred. It was built 
by scholars, dreamers, business men, 
crusaders, soldiers of fortune, gam- 
blers, whores, murderers and 
thieves. It was built by men with 
some of the best brains in the world 



and men with some of the worst 
brains in the world. And there 
wasn’t an American in the bunch, 
not at first; they were Greeks, Ger- 
mans, Irish, French, English, Ital- 
ians, Dutch, Japanese, Chinese, 
Spaniards and every other nation- 
ality in the world. 

The real reason this crazy pat- 
tern of humanity molded itself into 
a nation was that it had an incen- 
tive, and the chance to be rugged 
individualists if they so desired. Ad- 
mittedly each man or woman had 
his own incentive. Personal gain, 
power, freedom from religious or 
economic restrictions, freedom from 
national domination, . and the 
golden opportunity to search for, 
and find it in a fresh new world. 
They built and lived according to 
their lights. And gave others the 
right and opportunity to do the 
same. They murdered the Indians 
and were murdered in return ; 
they killed and robbed each other; 
fortunes and great industries 
changed hands in a card game or 
exploded from the muzzle of a gun. 

Human nature may not always 
be good, but it’s tough as raw- 
hide, and death and hardship were 
no obstacle to this conglomeration 
of humanity when there was an in- 
centive. 

So if history is to be a precedent, 
selective breeding isn’t too promis- 
ing an approach to a Utopian gov- 
ernment or state of civilization. 
Maybe there is one, however. May- 
be it’s the right incentive. Maybe 
that incentive is the free right of 
every human being to search for 
his or her own idea of Utopia — the 
pursuit of a dream that could some 
day result in the realization of at 
least a near-ideal. — jlq

THE EARTH QUARTER 



BY DAMON KNIGHT 



The Niroi permitted refugees from Earth to live in their 
cramped little ghetto conditionally: that they do so 
peacefully. But there will always be patriotic fanatics, like 
Harkway and Rack, who must disturb the peace . 



T HE SUN had set half an hour 
before. Now, from the window 
of Laszlo Cudyk’s garret, he could 
see how the alien city shone frost- 
blue against the black sky; the tall 
hive-shapes that no man would 
have built, glowing with their own 
light. 

Nearer, the slender drunken 
shafts of lamp posts marched to- 
ward him down the street, each 
with its prosaic yellow globe. Be- 
tween them and all around, the 
darkness had gathered; darkness in 
angular shapes, the geometry of 
squalor. 



Cudyk liked this view, for at 
night the blackness of the Earth 
Quarter seemed to merge with the 
black sky, as if one were a minor ex- 
tension of the other — a fist of space 
held down to the surface of the 
planet. He could feel, then, that he 
was not alone, not isolated and for- 
gotten; that some connection still 
existed across all the light-years of 
the galaxy between him and what 
he had lost. 

And, again, the view depressed 
him; for at night the City seemed 
to press in upon the Quarter like 
the walls of a prison. The Quarter: 



7 




sixteen square blocks, about the size 
of those of an Earth city, two thou- 
sand three hundred human beings 
of three races, four religions, eight- 
een nationalities; the only remnant 
of the human race nearer than 
Capella. 

Cudyk felt the night breeze fresh- 
ening. He glanced upward once at 
the frosty blaze of stars, then pulled 
his head back inside the window. 
He closed the shutters, turning to 
the lamp-lit table with its hopeless 
clutter of books, pipes and dusty 
miscellany. 

Cudyk was a man of middle 
height, heavy in the shoulders and 
chest, blunt-featured, with a shock 
of greying black hair. He was fifty- 
five years old; he remembered 
Earth. 

A drunk stumbled by in the street 
below, cursing monotonously to 
himself, paused to spit explosively 
into the gutter, and faded into the 
night. 

Gudyk heard him without atten- 
tion. He stood with his back to the 
window, looking at nothing, his 
square fingers fumbling automati- 
cally for pipe and tobacco. Why do 
I torture myself with that look out 
the window every night? he asked 
himself. It’s a juvenile sentimental- 
ism. 

But he knew he would go on do- 
ing it. 

Other noises drifted tip to his 
window, faint with distance. They 
grew louder. Cudyk cocked his head 
suddenly, turned and threw open 
the shutters again. That had been 
a scream. 

He could see nothing down the 
street; the trouble must be farther 
over, he thought, on Kwang-Chow- 
fu or Washington. The noise 

8 



swelled as he listened: the unintel- 
ligible wailing of a mob. 

Footsteps clicked hurriedly up 
the stairs. Gudyk went to the door, 
made sure it was latched, and 
waited. There was a light tapping 
on the door. 

“Who is it?” he said. 

“Lee Far ” 

He unlatched the door and 
opened it. The little Chinese 
blinked at him, his upper lip drawn 
up over incisors like a rodent’s. 
“Mr. Seu say please, you come.” 
Without waiting for an answer, he 
turned and rapped his way down 
into darkness. 

Cudyk picked up a jacket from 
a wall hook, and paused for a mo- 
ment to glance at the locked drawer 
in which he kept an ancient .32 
automatic and two full clips. He 
shook his head impatiently and 
went out. 

Lee was waiting for him down- 
stairs. When he saw Gudyk open 
the outer door, he set off down the 
street at a dog-trot. 

Gudyk caught up with him at 
the corner of Athenai and Brasil. 
They turned right for two blocks to 
Washington, then left again. A 
block away, at Rossiya and Wash- 
ington, there was a small crowd of 
men struggling in the middle of the 
street. They didn’t seem to be very 
active ; as Cudyk and Lee ap- 
proached, they saw that only a few 
were still fighting, and those with- 
out a great deal of spirit. The rest 
were moving aimlessly, some wip- 
ing their eyes, others bent almost 
double in paroxysms of sneezing. A 
few were motionless on the pave- 
ment. 

Three slender Chinese were mov- 
ing through the crowd. Each had a 

DAMON KNIGHT 




white surgeon’s mask tied over his 
nose and mouth, and carried a 
plastic bag full of some dark sub- 
stance, from which he took hand- 
fuls and flung them with a motion 
like a sower’s. Cudyk could see now 
that the air around them was heavy 
with floating particles. As he 
watched, the last two fighters in the 
crowd each took a halfhearted 
swing at the other and then, cough- 
ing and sneezing, moved away in 
separate directions. 

Lee took his sleeve for a mo- 
ment. “Here, Mr. Cudyk.” 

Seu was standing in the doorway 
of Town Hall, his round-bellied 
bulk almost filling it. He saluted 
Cudyk with a lazy, humorous ges- 
ture of one fat hand. 

“Hello, Min,” Cudyk said. 
“You’re efficient, as always. Pepper 
again?” 

“Yes,” said Mayor Seu Min. “I 
hate to waste it, but I don’t think 
the water buckets would have been 
enough this time. This could have 
been a bad one.” 

“How did it start?” 

“A couple of Russkies caught Jim 
Loong sneaking into Madame 
May’s,” the fat man said laconical- 
ly. His shrewd eyes twinkled. “I’m 
glad you came down, Laszlo. I want 
you to meet an important visitor 
who arrived on the Kt-I’ith ship 
this afternoon.” He turned slightly, 
and Cudyk saw that there was a 
man behind him in the doorway. 
“Mr. Harkway, may I present Mr. 
Laszlo Cudyk, one of our leading 
citizens? Mr. Cudyk, James Hark- 
way, who is here on a mission from 
the Minority People’s League.” 
Cudyk shook hands with the 
man, who had a pale, scholarly 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



face, not bad-looking, with dark in- 
tense eyes. He was young, about 
thirty. Cudyk automatically class- 
ified him as second generation. 

“Perhaps,” said Seu, as if the no- 
tion had just occurred to him, “you 
would not mind taking over my 
duties as host for a short time, 
Laszlo? If Mr. Harkway would not 
object? This regrettable occur- 
rence — ” 

“Of course,” Cudyk said. Hark- 
way nodded and smiled. 

“Excellent.” Seu edged past Cu- 
dyk, then turned and put a hand on 
his friend’s arm, drawing him 
closer. “Take care of this fool,” he 
said under his breath, “and for 
God’s sake keep him away from the 
saloons. Rack is in town, too. I’ve 
got to make sure they don’t meet.” 
He smiled cheerfully at both of 
them and walked away. Lee Far, 
appearing from somewhere, trailed 
after him. 

A young Chinese, with blood 
streaming brightly from a gash in 
his cheek, was stumbling past. Cu- 
dyk stepped away from the door- 
way, turned him around and 
pointed him down the street, to 
where Seu’s young men were lay- 
ing out the victims on the sidewalk 
and administering first aid. 

Cudyk went back to Harkway. “I 
suppose Seu has found you a place 
to stay,” he said. 

“Yes,” said Harkway. “He’s put- 
ting me up in his home. Perhaps I’d 
better go there now — I don’t want 
to be in the way.” 

“You won’t be in the way,” Cu- 
dyk told him. “What would you like 
to do?” 

“Well, I’d like to meet a few 
people, if it isn’t too late. Perhaps 
we could have a drink somewhere, 

9 




where people meet — ?” He glanced 
interrogatively down the street to 
an illuminated sign that announced 
in English and Russian: “THE 
LITTLE BEAR. Wines and Liq- 
uors.” 

“Not there,” said Cudyk. “That’s 
Russky headquarters, and I’m 
afraid they may be a little short- 
tempered right now. The best place 
would be Chong Yin’s tea room, I 
think. That’s just two blocks up, 
near Washington and Ceskosloven- 
sko.” 

“All right,” said Harkway. He 
was still looking down the street. 
“Who is that girl?” he asked 
abruptly. 

Cudyk glanced that way. The 
two M. D.’s, Moskowitz and Estra- 
da, were on the scene, sorting out 
the most serious cases to be carted 
off to hospital, and so was a slender, 
dark-haired girl in nurse’s uniform. 

“That’s Kathy Burgess,” he said. 
“I’d introduce you, but now isn’t 
the time. You’ll probably meet her 
tomorrow.” 

“She’s very pretty,” said Hark- 
way, and suffered himself to be led 
off up the street. “Married?” 

“No. She was engaged to one of 
our young men, but her father 
broke it off.” 

“Oh?” said Harkway. After a 
moment: “Political differences?” 

“Yes. The young man joined the 
activists. The father is a conserva- 
tive.” 

“That’s very interesting,” said 
Harkway. After a moment he asked, 
“Do you have many of those here?” 

“Activists or conservatives? Or 
pretty girls?” 

“I meant conservatives,” said 
Harkway, coloring slightly. “I know 
the activist movement is strong here 

10 



— that’s why I was sent. We con- 
sider them dangerous in the ex- 
treme.” 

“So do I,” said Cudyk. “No, 
there aren’t many conservatives. 
Burgess is the only real fanatic. If 
you meet him, by the way, you must 
make certain allowances.” 

Harkway nodded thoughtfully. 
“Cracked on the subject?” 

“You could put it that way,” 
Cudyk told him. “He has convinced 
himself, in his conscious mind at 
least, that we are the dominant 
species on this planet; that the 
Niori are our social and economic 
inferiors. He won’t tolerate any sug- 
gestion that it isn’t so.” 

Harkway nodded again, looking 
very solemn. “A tragedy,” he said. 
“But understandable, of course. 
Some of the older people simply 
can’t adjust to the reality of our 
position in the galaxy.” 

“Not many people actually like 
it,” said Cudyk. 

Harkway looked at him thought- 
fully. He said, “Mr. Cudyk, I don’t 
want you to take this as a com- 
plaint, but I’ve gathered the im- 
pression that you’re not in sympathy 
with the Minority People’s 
League.” 

“No,” said Cudyk. 

“May I ask what your political 
viewpoint is?” 

“I’m neutral,” said Cudyk. 
“Apolitical.” . 

Harkway said politely, “I hope 
you won’t take offense if I ask why? 
It’s evident, even to me, that you’re 
a man of intelligence and ability.” 

Everything is evident to you, Cu- 
dyk thought wearily, except what 
you don’t want to see. He said, “I 
don’t believe our particular Hump- 
ty Dumpty can be put back to- 

DAMON KNIGHT 




gether again, Mr. Harkway.” 

Harkway looked at him intently, 
but said nothing. He glanced at the 
signboard over the lighted windows 
they were approaching. “Is this the 
place?” 

“Yes.” 

Harkway continued to look at the 
sign. Above the English “CHONG 
YIN’S TEA ROOM”, and the 
Chinese characters, was a legend 
that read: 

Nrn \nm yxii a<ixjvvi 

“That’s a curious alphabet,” he 
said. 

“It’s a very efficient one,” Cudyk 
told him. “It’s based on the design 
of an X in a rectangle — like this.” 
He traced it with his finger on the 
wall. “Counting each arm of the 
cross as one stroke, there are eight 
strokes in the figure. Using only 
two strokes to a letter, there are 
twenty-eight possible combinations. 
They use the sixteen most graceful 
ones, and add twenty-seven three- 
stroke letters to bring it up to forty- 
three, one for each sound in their 
language. The written language is 
completely phonetic, therefore. But 
there are only eight keys on a Niori 
typewriter.” 

He looked at Harkway. “It’s also 
perfectly legible: no letter looks too 
much like any other letter. And it 
has a certain beauty, don’t you 
think?” He paused. “Hasn’t it 
struck you, Mr. Harkway, that any- 
thing our hosts do is likely to be a 
little more sensible and more sensi- 
tive than the human equivalent?” 

“I come from Reg Otay,” said 
Harkway. “They don’t have any 
visual arts or any written language 
there. But I see what you mean. 
What does the sign say — the same 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



thing as the English?” 

“No. It says, ‘Yungiwo Ren 
Trakru Rith.’ ‘Trakru rith’ is Niori 
for ‘hospitality house’ — it’s what 
they call anything that we would 
call tea room, or restaurant, or beer 
garden.” 

“And ‘Yungiwo Ren’?” 

“That’s their version of ‘Chung 
kuo jen’* — the Chinese for 
‘Chinese.’ At first they called us all 
that, because most of the original 
immigrants were from China; but 
they’ve got over it now — they found 
out some of us didn’t like it.” 

Cudyk opened the door. 

A few aliens were sitting at the 
round tables in the big outer room. 
Cudyk watched Harkway’ s face, 
and saw his eyes widen with shock, 
the Niori were something to see, 
the first time. 

They were tall and erect, and 
their anatomy was not even re- 
motely like man’s. They had six 
limbs each, two for walking, four 
for manipulation. Their bodies 
were covered by a pale, horny in- 
tegument which grew in irregular 
sections, so that you could tell the 
age of a Niori by the width of the 
growth-areas between the plates of 
his armor. But you saw none of 
those things at first. You saw the 
two glowing violet eyes, set wide 
apart in a helmet-shaped head, and 
the startlingly beautiful markings 
on the smooth shell of the face — 
blue on pale cream, like an ancient 
porcelain tile. And you saw the 
crest — a curved, lucent shape that 
even in a lighted room glowed with 
its own frost-blue. No Niori ever 
walked in darkness. 

* Pronounced “jung guo ren 

11 




Gudyk guided Harkway toward 
the door at the far end of the room. 
“We’ll see who’s in the back room/’ 
he said. “There is usually a small 
gathering at this hour.” 

The inner room was more bright- 
ly lit than the other. Down the cen- 
ter, in front of a row of empty 
booths, was a long table. Three men 
sat at one end of it, with teacups 
and a bowl of lichee nuts between 
them. They looked up as Cudyk 
and Harkway came in. 

“Gentlemen,” said Cudyk, “may 
I present Mr. Harkway, who is here 
on a mission from the Minority 
People’s League? Mr. Burgess, Fa- 
ther Exarkos, Mr. Ferguson.” 

The three shook hands with 
Harkway, Father Exarkos smiling 
pleasantly, the other two with more 
guarded expressions. The priest was 
in his fifties, grey-haired, hollow- 
templed, with high orbital ridges 
and a square, mobile mouth. He 
said, in English oddly accented by a 
mixture of French and Greek, 
“Please sit down, both of you. 
I understand that your first evening 
here has been not too pleasant, Mr. 
Harkway. I hope the rest of your 
stay will be more so.” 

Burgess snorted, not quite loudly 
enough to be deliberately rude. His 
face had a pleasant, even a hand- 
some cast except for the expression 
of petulance he was now wearing. 
He was a few years younger than 
the priest: a big-boned, big-fea- 
tured man whose slightly curved 
back and hollowed cheeks showed 
that he had lost bulk since his 
prime. 

Ferguson’s pale face was expres- 
sive but completely controlled. The 
gambler’s eyes were narrow and un- 
readable, the lips and the long 

12 



muscles of the jaw showing nothing 
more than surface emotion. He 
asked politely, “Planning to stay 
long, Mr. Harkway?” 

“That all depends, Mr. Ferguson, 
on — to be blunt, on what sort of a 
reception I get. I won’t try to con- 
ceal from you the fact that my role 
here is that of a political propa- 
gandist. I want to convince as many 
people as I can that the Minority 
People’s movement is the best hope 
of the human race. If I can find 
that there’s some chance of suc- 
ceeding, I’ll stay as long as neces- 
sary. If not — ” 

“I’m afraid we won’t be seeing 
much of you, in that case, Mr. 
Harkway,” said Burgess. His tone 
was scrupulously correct, but his 
nostrils were quivering with re- 
pressed indignation. 

“What makes you say that, Mr. 
Burgess?” Harkway asked, turning 
his intent, serious gaze on the older 
man. 

“Your program, as I understand 
it,” said Burgess, “aims at putting 
humanity on an equal basis with 
various assorted races of lizards, 
beetles and other vermin. I don’t 
think you will find much sympathy 
for that program here, sir.” 

“I’m glad to say that, through no 
fault of your own, you’re mis- 
taken,” said Harkway, smiling 
slightly. “I think you’re referring 
to the program of the right wing 
of the League, which was dominant 
for the last several years. It’s true 
that for that period, the M.P.L.’s 
line was to work for the gradual 
integration of human beings — and 
other repressed races — into the 
society of the planets on which they 
live. But that’s all done with now. 
The left wing, to which I belong, 

DAMON KNIGHT 




has won a decisive victory at the 
League elections. 

“Our program,” Harkway con- 
tinued earnestly, “rejects the doc- 
trine of assimilation as a biological 
and cultural absurdity. What we 
propose to do, and with sufficient 
help will do, is to return humanity 
to its homeland — to reconstitute 
Earth as an autonomous, civilized 
member of the galactic entity. We 
realize, of course, that this is a gi- 
gantic undertaking, and that much 
aid will be required from the other 
races of the galaxy. Were you 
about to say something, Mr. Bur- 
gess?” 

Burgess said bitterly, “What you 
mean, in plain words, Mr. Hark- 
way, is that you think we all ought 
to go home — dissolve Earth’s galac- 
tic empire — give it all back to the 
natives. I don’t think you’ll find 
much support for that , either.” 

Harkway bit his lip, and cast a 
glance at Cudyk that seemed to 
say, You warned me, but I for- 
got. He turned to Ferguson, who 
was smiling around his cigar as 
blandly as if nothing out of the way 
had been said. “What is your view, 
Mr. Ferguson?” 

Ferguson waved his cigar ami- 
ably. “You’ll have to count me out, 
Mr. Harkway. I’m doing okay as 
things are — I have no reason to 
want any changes.” 

Harkway turned to the little 
priest. “And you, Father Exarkos?” 

The Greek shrugged and smiled. 
“I wish you all the luck in the 
universe, sincerely,” he said. “But I 
am afraid I believe that no material 
methods can rescue man from his 
dilemma.” 

“If I’ve given any offense,” said 
Burgess suddenly, “I can leave.” 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



Harkway stared at him for. a 
moment, gears almost visibly slip- 
ping in his head. Then he said, “Of 
course not, Mr. Burgess, please 
don’t think that for a moment. I 
respect your views — ” 

Burgess looked around him with 
a wounded expression. “I know,” 
he said with difficulty, “that I am 
in a minority — here — ” 

Father Exarkos put a hand on 
his arm and murmured something. 
Harkway leaned forward impul- 
sively across the table and said, 
“Mr. Burgess, I’ve traveled a long 
way in the hope of discussing these 
problems with men of intelligence 
and standing in their community, 
like yourself. I hope you’ll stay and 
give me the benefit of your experi- 
ence. I shall be very much the loser 
if you don’t.” 

Burgess was visibly struggling 
with his emotions. He stood up and 
said, “No — no — not tonight. I’m 
upset. Please excuse me.” Head 
bowed, he walked out of the room. 

There was a short silence. “Did 
I do the wrong thing?” asked Hark- 
way. 

“No, no,” said Father Exarkos. 
“It was not your fault — there was 
nothing you could do. You must 
excuse him. He is a good man, but 
he has suffered too much. Since his 
wife died — of a disease contracted 
during one of the Famines, you un- 
derstand — he has not been him- 
self.” 

Harkway nodded, looking both 
older and more human than he had 
a moment before. “If we can only 
turn back the clock,” he said. “Put 
Humpty Dumpty together again, as 
you expressed it, Mr. Cudyk.” He 
smiled apologetically at them. “I 
won’t harangue you any more to- 

13 




night — I’ll save that for the meet- 
ing tomorrow. But I hope that some 
of you will come to see it my way.” 

Father Exarkos’ eyebrows lifted. 
“You are planning to hold a public 
meeting tomorrow?” 

“Yes. There’s some difficulty 
about space — Mayor Seu tells me 
that the town hall is already booked 
for the next three days — but I’m 
confident that I can find some suit- 
able place. If necessary, I’ll make 
it an open-air meeting.” 

Rack, thought Gudyk. Rack 
usually stays in town for only two or 
three days at a time. Seu is trying 
to keep Harkway under cover until 
he leaves. It won’t work. 

Out of the comer of his eye he 
saw a dark shape in the doorway, 
and his first thought was that Bur- 
gess had come back. But it was not 
Burgess. It was a squat, bandy- 
legged man with huge shoulders 
and arms, wearing a leather jacket 
and a limp military cap. Cudyk sat 
perfectly still, warning Exarkos 
with his eyes. 

The squat man walked casually 
up the table, nodding almost im- 
perceptibly to Ferguson. He ig- 
nored the others, except the M.P.L. 
man. “Your name Harkway?” he 
asked. He pronounced it with the 
flat Boston “a”: “Haakway”. 

“That’s right,” said Harkway. 

“Got a message for you,” said 
the squat man. “From Captain 
Lawrence Rack, United Uth Space 
Navy.” 

“The Earth Space Navy was dis- 
solved twenty years ago,” said 
Harkway. 

The squat man sighed. “You 
wanna heah the message or don’t 
you?” he asked. 

“Go ahead,” said Harkway. His 



nostrils were pale, and a muscle 
stood out at the side of his jaw. 

“Heah it is. You’re plannin’ to 
hold a meetin’ of the vehmin 
lovehs society, right?” 

As Harkway began to reply, the 
squat man leaned across the table 
and backhanded him across the 
mouth, knocking him sideways out 
of his chair. 

“Don’t,” said the squat man. He 
turned and strolled out. 

Gudyk and Ferguson helped 
Harkway up. The man’s eyes were 
staring wildly out of his pale face, 
and a thin trickle of blood was 
running from a pulped lip. “Who 
was that man?” he asked in a 
whisper. 

“His name is Monk,” said Cudyk. 
“At least that is the only name he 
has been known to answer to. He is 
one of Rack’s lieutenants — Rack, as 
you probably know, is the leader of 
the activists in this sector. Mr. 
Harkway, I’m sorry this happened. 
But I advise you to wait for a week 
or so before you hold your meeting. 
There is no question of courage in- 
volved. It would be suicide.” 

Harkway looked at him blindly. 
“The meeting will be held as 
planned,” he said, and walked out, 
stiff-legged. 

Ferguson shook his head, 
laughed, and shook his head again. 
Cudyk exchanged a hopeless glance 
with Father Exarkos, and then fol- 
lowed Harkway out of the room. 

T HE SHOP was empty except 
for young Nick Pappageorge, 
dozing behind the long counter, and 
the pale morning sunlight that 
streamed through the plastic win- 
dow. Most of the counter was in 



14 



DAMON KNIGHT 




shadow, but stray fingers of light 
picked out gem trays here and 
there, turning them into minuscule 
galaxies of frosty brilliance. 

Two Niori, walking arm in arm, 
paused in front of the window dis- 
play, then went on. Two human 
youngsters raced by, shouting. 
Cudyk caught only a glimpse of 
them through the pierced screen 
that closed off the back of his shop, 
but he recognized them by their 
voices: Red Gorciak and Stan 
Eleftheris. 

There were few children now, 
and they were growing up wild. 
Cudyk wondered briefly what it 
must be like to be a child born into 
this microcosm, knowing no other. 
He dismissed the thought; it was 
simply one more thing about which 
there was no use to worry. 

Cudyk had not spoken to anyone 
that morning, but he knew approxi- 
mately what was happening. Seu 
would have been busy most of the 
night, covering up the traces of last 
evening’s riot. Now, probably, he 
was explaining it away to Zydh 
Oran, the Niori Outgroup Commis- 
sioner. Harkway was making 
preparations for his meeting — an- 
other thing for Seu to worry about 
when he got through cleaning up 
the last mess. 

Barring miracles, today was going 
to be very bad. 

Seu came in, moving quickly. He 
walked directly to the rear of the 
shop. His normally bland face 
looked worried, and there were 
beads of sweat on his wide fore- 
head, although the morning was 
cool. 

“Sit down,” said Cudyk. “You’ve 
seen Zydh Oran?” 

Seu made a dismissing gesture. 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



“Nothing. Not pleasant, but noth- 
ing. The same as usual — he tells me 
what happened, I deny it. He 
knows, but under their laws he 
can’t do anything.” 

“Someday it will be bad,” said 
Cudyk. 

“Yes. Someday. Laszlo — you’ve 
got to do something about Hark- 
way. Otherwise he’s going to be 
killed tonight, and there will be a 
stink from here to Sirius. I had to 
tell him he could use Town Hall — 
he was all ready to hold a torch- 
light meeting in the streets.” 

“I tried,” said Cudyk. 

“Try again. Please. Your ethnic 
background is closer to his than 
mine. He respects you, I think. Per- 
haps he’s even read some of your 
books. If anyone can persuade him, 
you can.” 

“What did he say when you 
talked to him?” 

“An ox. A brain made of soap 
and granite. He says it is a matter 
of principle. I knew then that I 
could do nothing. When an Anglo- 
Saxon talks about his principles, 
you may as well go home. He won’t 
accept a weapon, he won’t postpone 
the meeting. I think he wants to be 
a martyr.” 

Cudyk frowned. “Maybe he does. 
Have you seen Rack?” 

“No. Ferguson pretends not to 
know where he is.” 

“That’s rather odd. What is his 
motive, do you think?” 

Seu said, “Basically, he is afraid 
of Rack. He cooperates with him — 
they use each other — but you know 
that it’s not a marriage of minds. 
He knows that Rack is stronger 
than he is, because he is only an 
amoral egotist, and Rack is a fana- 
tic. I think he believes this business 



15 




may be Rack’s downfall, and he 
would like that.” 

He stood up. “I have to go. Will 
you do it?” 

“Yes.” 

“Good. Let me know.” Seu 
walked out, as hastily as he had 
entered. 

Nick Pappageorge had roused 
himself and was polishing a tall, 
fluted silver vase. Cudyk said, 
“Nick, go and find out where Mr. 
Harkway is. If he isn’t busy, ask 
him if he’ll do me the favor of 
dropping around to see me. Other- 
wise, just come back and tell me 
where he is; I’ll go to him.” 

Nick said, “Sure, Mr. Cudyk,” 
and went out. 

Cudyk stared at the tray of un- 
sorted gems on the desk before him. 
He stirred them with his forefinger, 
separating out an emerald, two 
aquamarines, a large turquoise and 
a star sapphire. That was all he had 
had to begin with — his dead wife’s 
jewels, carried half across Europe 
when a loaf of bread was worth 
more than all the gem stones in the 
world. The sapphire had bought his 
passage on the alien ship ; the others 
had been his original stock-in- 
trade, first at the refugee center on 
Alfhal, then here on Palumbar. 
Now he was a prosperous importer, 
with a business that netted him the 
equivalent of ten thousand pounds 
a year. 

But the wealth was ashes; he 
would have traded all of it for one 
loaf of bread, eaten in peace, on an 
Earth that had not sunk back to 
barbarism. 

Momentum, he told himself. Mo- 
mentum, and a remnant of curios- 
ity. Those are the only reasons I 
can think of why I do not blow out 

16 



my brains. I wonder what keeps the 
others from it? Seu? Chong Yin? I 
don’t know. Burgess has his fantasy, 
though it cracks now and then. 
Ferguson has the sensibility of a 
jackal. Rack, as Seu said, is a 
fanatic. But why do the rest of 
them keep on? For what? 

The doorway darkened again as 
Harkway came in, followed by 
Nick. Nick gestured toward the rear 
of the shop, and Harkway ad- 
vanced, smiling. His lower lip was 
stained by a purple substance with 
a glossy surface. 

Cudyk greeted him and offered 
him a chair. “It was good of you 
to come over,” he said. “I hope I 
didn’t interrupt your work.” 

Harkway grinned stiffly. “No. I 
was just finishing lunch when your 
boy found me. I have nothing more 
to do until this evening.” 

Cudyk looked at him. “You got 
to the hospital after all, I see.” 

“Yes. Dr. Moskowitz fixed me up 
nicely.” 

Cudyk had been asking himself 
why the M.P.L. man looked so 
cheerful. Now he thought he under- 
stood. 

“And Miss Burgess?” he asked. 

“Yes,” said Harkway, looking 
embarrassed. He paused. “She’s — 
an exquisite person, Mr. Cudyk.” 

Cudyk clasped his square hands 
together, elbows on the arms of his 
chair. He said, “Forgive me, I’m 
going to be personal. Am I right in 
saying that you now feel more than 
casually interested in Miss Bur- 
gess?” 

He added, “Please. I have a rea- 
son for asking.” 

Harkway’s expression was 
guarded. “Yes; that’s true.” 

DAMON KNIGHT 




“Do you think she may feel 
similarly towards you?” 

Harkway paused. “I think ^so. I 
hope so. Why, Mr. Cudyk?” 

“Mr. Harkway, I will be very 
blunt. Miss Burgess has already lost 
one lover through no fault of her 
own, and the experience has not 
been good for her. She is, as you 
say, exquisite — she has a beautiful, 
but not a strong personality. Do you 
think it is fair for you to give her 
another such experience, even if the 
attachment is not fully formed, by 
allowing yourself to be killed this 
evening?” 

Harkway leaned back in his 
chair. “Oh,” he said, “that’s it.” 
He grinned. “I thought you were 
going to point out that her father 
broke off the last affair because of 
the man’s politics. If you had, I 
was going to tell you that Mr. Bur- 
gess looked me up this morning and 
apologized for his attitude yester- 
day, and breaking down and so on. 
He’s very decent, you know. We’re 
getting along very well.” 

He paused. “About this other 
matter,” he said seriously, “I’m 
grateful for your interest, but — I’m 
afraid I can’t concede the validity 
of your argument.” He made an 
impatient gesture. “I’m not trying 
to sound noble, but this business is 
more important than my personal 
life. That’s all, I’m afraid. I’m 
sorry.” 

Another fanatic, Cudyk thought. 
A liberal fanatic. I have seen all 
kinds, now. He said, “I have one 
more argument to try. Has Seu ex- 
plained to you how precarious our 
position is here on Palumbar?” 
“He spoke of it.” 

“The Niori accepted this one 
THE EARTH QUARTER 



small colony with grave misgivings. 
Every act of violence that occurs 
here weakens our position, because 
it furnishes ammunition for a group 
which already wants to expel us. Do 
you understand?” 

There was pain in Harkway’ s 
eyes. “Mr. Cudyk, it’s the same 
all over the galaxy, wherever these 
pitifully tiny outgroups exist. My 
group is trying to attack that prob- 
lem on a galaxy-wide scale. I don’t 
say we’ll succeed, and I grant you 
the right to doubt that our program 
is the right one. But we’ve got to 
try. Among other things, we’ve got 
to clean out the activists, for just 
the reason you mention. And — 
pardon me for stressing the obvious 
— but it’s Captain Rack who will 
be responsible for this particular 
act of violence if it occurs, not my- 
self.” 

“And you think that your death 
at his hands would be a stronger 
argument than a peaceful meeting, 
is that it?” 

Harkway shook his head rue- 
fully. “I don’t know that I have 
that much courage, Mr. Cudyk. I’m 
hoping that nothing will happen to 
me. But I know that the League’s 
prestige here would be enormously 
hurt if I let Rack bluff me down.” 
He stood up. “You’ll be at the 
meeting?” 

“I’m afraid so.” Cudyk stood and 
offered his hand. “The best of luck.” 

He watched the young man go, 
feeling very old and tired. He had 
known it would be this way; he had 
only tried for Seu’s sake. Now he 
was involved; he had allowed him- 
self to feel the tug of love and pity 
toward still another lost soul. Such 
bonds were destructive — they 
turned the heart brittle and 



17 




weathered it away, bit by bit. 

The assembly hall was well filled, 
although Harkway had made no 
special effort to advertise the meet- 
ing. He had known, Cudyk thought, 
that Rack’s threat would be more 
than sufficient. The youngster was 
not stupid. 

There were no women or chil- 
dren. Ferguson was there, and a 
large contingent of his employees — 
gamblers, pimps, waiters and 
strong-arm men — as well as most 
of the Russian population. All but a 
few of the Chinese had stayed away, 
as had Burgess. But a number of 
men whom Cudyk knew to have 
M.P.L. leanings, and an even larger 
number of neutrals, were there. The 
audience was about evenly divided, 
for and against Harkway. If he 
somehow came through this alive, 
it was just possible that he could 
swing the Quarter his way. A futile 
victory; but of course Harkway did 
not believe that. 

There was a murmur and a 
shuffle of feet as Rack entered with 
three other men — Monk, the one 
called Spider, and young Tom De 
Grasse, who had once been engaged 
to Kathy Burgess. The sound 
dropped almost to stillness for a 
few moments after the four men 
took seats at the side of the hall, 
then rose again to a steady rumble. 
Harkway and Seu had not yet ap- 
peared. 

Cudyk saw the man to his right 
getting up, moving away ; he turned 
in time to see Seu wedge himself 
through a gap in the line of chairs 
and sit down in the vacated place. 

The fat man’s face was blandly 
expressionless, but Cudyk knew that 
something had happened. “What is 

18 



it?” he asked. 

Seu’s lips barely moved. He 
looked past Cudyk, inspecting die 
crowd with polite interest. “I had 
him kidnapped,” he said happily. 
“He’s tied up, in a safe place. There 
won’t be any meeting today.” 

Seu had been seen. Someone a 
few rows ahead called, “Where’s 
Harkway, Mayor?” 

“I don’t know,” Seu said blandly. 
“He told me he would meet me 
here — said he had an errand to do. 
Probably he’s on his way now.” 
Under cover of the ensuing mur- 
mur, he turned to Cudyk again. 
“I didn’t want to do it,” he said. 
“It will mean trouble, sooner or 
later; maybe almost as much trou- 
ble as if Harkway had been killed. 
But I had to make a choice. Do you 
think I did the right thing, Laszlo?” 
“Yes,” said Cudyk, “except that 
I wish you had told me earlier.” 
Seu smiled, his heavy face be- 
coming for that instant open and 
confiding. “If I had, you wouldn’t 
have been so sincere when you 
talked to Harkway.” 

Cudyk smiled in spite of himself. 
He relaxed in his chair, savoring the 
relief that had come when he’d 
learned that Harkway was not going 
to die. The tension built up, day by 
day, almost imperceptibly, and it 
was a rare, fleeting pleasure when 
something happened to lower it. 

He saw the mayor looking at his 
watch. The crowd was growing 
restless: in a few more minutes 
Seu would get up and announce 
that the meeting was cancelled. 
Then it would be all over. 

Seu was rising when a new wave 
of sound traveled over the audience. 
Out of the comer of his eye Cudyk 
saw men turning, standing up to 

DAMON KNIGHT 




see over the heads of their neigh- 
bors. Seu spoke a single, sharp 
word, and his hand tightened on 
the back of his chair. 

Gudyk stood. Someone was com- 
ing down the center aisle of the 
room, but he couldn’t see who it 
was. 

Those who had stood earlier 
were sitting down now. Down the 
aisle, looking straight ahead, with 
a bruised jaw and a bloody scratch 
running from cheekbone to chin, 
came James Harkway. 

He mounted the platform, rested 
both hands on the low speaker’s 
stand, and turned his glance across 
the audience, once, from side to 
side. There was a collective scraping 
of chairs and clearing of throats, 
then complete stillness. Harkway 
said: 

“My friends — and enemies.” 

Subdued laughter rippled across 
the room. 

“A few of my enemies didn’t 
want me to hold this meeting,” said 
Harkway. “Some of my friends felt 
the same way. In fact, it seemed 
that nobody wanted this meeting to 
take place. But here you all are, just 
the same. And here I am.” 

He straightened. “Why is that, I 
wonder? Perhaps because regardless 
of our differences, we’re all in the 
same boat — in a lifeboat.” He 
nodded gravely. “Yes, we’re all in 
a lifeboat — all of us together, to live 
or die, and we don’t know which 
way to turn for the nearest land 
that will give us harbor. 

“Which way shall we turn to find 
a safe landing? To find peace and 
honor for ourselves and our chil- 
dren? To find safety, to find happi- 
ness?” 

He spread his arms. “There are a 
THE EARTH QUARTER 



million directions we could follow. 
There are all the planets in the 
galaxy! But everywhere we turn, 
we find alien soil, alien cultures, 
alien people. Everywhere except in 
one direction only. 

“Our ship — our own planet, 
Earth — is foundering, is sinking, 
that’s true. But it hasn’t — yet — 
sunk. There’s still a chance that we 
can turn back, make Earth what it 
was, and then, from there — go on! 
Go on, until we’ve made a greater 
Earth, a stronger, happier, more 
peaceful Earth — till we can take 
our place with pride in the galaxy, 
and hold up our heads with any 
other race that lives.” 

He had captured only half their 
attention, and he knew it. They 
were watching him, listening to 
what he said, but the heads of the 
audience were turned slightly, like 
the heads of plants under a solar 
tropism, toward the side of the 
chamber where Rack and his men 
sat. 

Harkway said, “We all know that 
the Earth’s technical civilization is 
smashed — broken like an eggshell. 
By ourselves, we could never put 
it back together. And if we do noth- 
ing, no one else is going to put it 
back together for us. But suppose 
we went to the other races in the 
galaxy, and said — ” 

A baritone voice broke in quiet- 
ly, “‘We’ll sell our souls to you, if 
you’ll kindly give us a few ma- 
chines!’ ” 

Rack stood up — tall, muscular, 
lean, with deep hollows under his 
cheekbones, red-grey hair falling 
over his forehead under the visor 
of his cap. His short leather jacket 
was thrown over his shoulders like 

19 




a cloak. His narrow features were 
grey and cold, the mouth a straight, 
hard line. He said, “That’s what 
you want us to tell the vermin, isn’t 
it, Mr. Harkway?” 

Harkway seemed to settle himself 
like a boxer. He said clearly, “The 
intelligent races of the galaxy are 
not devils and do not want our 
souls, Mr. Rack.” 

Rack ignored the “Mr.” He said, 
“But they’d want certain assurances 
from us, in return for their help, 
wouldn’t they, Mr. Harkway?” 
“Certainly,” said Harkway. “As- 
surances that no sane man would 
refuse them. Assurances, for ex- 
ample, that there would be no repe- 
tition of the Altair Incident — when 
a handful of maniacs in two ships 
murdered thousands of peaceful 
galactic citizens without the slight- 
est provocation. Perhaps you re- 
member that, Mr. Rack; perhaps 
you were there.” 

“I was there,” said Rack casually. 
“About five hundred thousand ver- 
min were squashed. We would have 
done a better job, but we ran out 
of supplies. Some day we’ll ex- 
terminate them all, and then there’ll 
be a universe fit for men to live in. 
Meanwhile — ” he glanced at the 
audience — “we’re going to build. 
We’re building now. Not with the 
vermin’s permission, under the ver- 
min’s eye. In secret. On a planet 
they’ll never find until our ships 
spurt out from it like milt from a 
fish. And when that day comes, 
we’ll squash them down to the last 
tentacle and the last claw.” 

“Are you finished?” asked Hark- 
way. He was quivering with con- 
trolled rage. 

“Yes, I’m finished,” said Rack 
wearily. “So are you. You’re a trai- 

20 



tor, Harkway, the most miserable 
kind of a crawling, dirt-eating 
traitor the human race ever pro- 
duced. Get down off the platform.” 
Harkway said to the audience, “I 
came here to try to persuade you to 
my way of thinking — to ask you^ to 
consider the arguments and decide 
for yourselves. This man wants to 
settle the question by prejudice and 
force. Which of us is best entitled 
to the name ‘human?’ If you listen 
to him, can you blame the Niori if 
they decide to end even this tiny 
foothold they’ve given you on their 
planet? Would you live in a uni- 
verse drenched with blood?” 

Rack said quietly, “Monk.” 

The squat man stood up, smiling. 
He took a clasp knife out of his 
pocket, opened it, and started up 
the side of the room. 

In the dead stillness, another 
voice said, “No!” 

It was, Cudyk saw with shock, 
Tom De Grasse. The youngster was 
up, moving past Rack — who made 
no move to stop him, did not even 
change expression — past the squat 
man, turning a yard beyond, almost 
at the front of the room. His square, 
almost childish face was tight with 
strain. There was a pistol in one big 
hand. 

Cudyk felt something awaken in 
him which blossomed only at mo- 
ments like this, when one of his 
fellow men did something particu- 
larly puzzling: the root, slain but 
still quasi-living, of the thing that 
had once been his central drive and 
his trademark in the world — his in- 
satiable, probing, warmly intelli- 
gent curiosity about the motives of 
men. 

On the surface, this action of De 
Grasse’s was baldly impossible. He 

DAMON KNIGHT 




was committed to Rack’s cause 
twice over, by conviction and by the 
shearing away of every other tie; 
and still more important, he wor- 
shipped Rack himself with the de- 
votion that only fanatics can in- 
spire. It was as if Peter had defied 
Christ. 

The three men stood motionless 
for what seemed a long time. Monk, 
halted with his weight on one foot, 
faced De Grasse with his knife hand 
slightly extended, thumb on the 
blade. He was visibly tense, waiting 
for a word from Rack. But Rack 
stood as if he had forgotten time 
and space, staring bemused over 
Monk’s shoulder at De Grasse. The 
fourth man, Spider — bones and 
gristle, with a corpse-growth of 
grey-white hair — stood up slowly. 
Rack put a hand on his shoulder 
and pressed him down again. 

Cudyk thought: Kathy Burgess. 

It was the only answer. De Grasse 
knew, of course, everything that 
had passed between Harkway and 
the girl. There was no privacy 
worth mentioning in the Quarter. 
Pressed in this narrow ghetto, every 
man swam in the effluvium of every 
other man’s emotions. And De 
Grasse was willing, apparently, to 
give up everything that mattered 
to him, to save Kathy Burgess pain. 

It said something for the breed, 
Cudyk thought — not enough, never 
enough, for you saw it only in pin- 
point flashes, the noble individual 
who was a part of the bestial mob — 
but a light in the darkness, never- 
theless. 

Finally Rack spoke. “You, 
Tom?” 

The youngster’s eyes showed sud- 
den pain. But he said, “I mean it, 
Captain.” 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



There was a slow movement out 
from that side of the room, men 
inching away, crowding against 
their neighbors. 

Rack was still looking past 
Monk’s shoulder, into De Grasse’s 
face. He said : 

“All right.” 

He turned, still wearing the same 
frozen expression, and walked down 
the side of the room, toward the 
exit. Monk threw a glance of pure 
incredulity over his shoulder, 
glanced back at De Grasse, and 
then followed. Spider scrambled 
after. 

De Grasse relaxed slowly, as if 
by conscious effort. He put away his 
gun, hesitated a moment, and 
walked slowly out after the others. 
His wide shoulders were slumped. 

Then there was the scraping of 
chairs and boot-soles and a rising 
bee-hive hum as the audience stood 
up and began to move out. Hark- 
way made no effort to call them 
back. 

Cudyk, moving toward the exit 
with the rest, had much to think 
about. He had seen not only De 
Grasse’s will, but Rack’s, part 
against the knife of human sym- 
pathy. And that was a thing he had 
never expected to see. 

“Times like this,” said Ferguson, 
narrowing his grey snake’s eyes in 
a smile, “I almost believe in God.” 

Father Exarkos smiled courteous- 
ly and said nothing. He and Cudyk 
had been sitting in the back room 
of Chong Yin’s since a half-hour 
after the meeting. Seu had been 
with them earlier, but had left. A 
little after twelve, Ferguson had 
strolled in and joined them. 

“I mean it,” said Ferguson, 

21 





laughing a little. There was Hark- 
way, sticking his neck out, and 
there was little De Grasse standing 
in the way. And Rack backed 
down.” He shook his head, still 
smiling. “Rack backed down. Now 
how would you explain that, gentle- 
men?” 

It was necessary to put up with 
the gambler, who wielded more 
power in the Quarter than anyone 
else, even Seu ; but sometimes 
Cudyk found himself dropping his 
usual attitude of detached interest 
in favor of speculations about the 
specific variety of horrible fate 
which Ferguson would most prob- 
ably meet. 

He was particularly irritating to- 
night, because Cudyk was forced to 
agree with him. Cudyk had still not 
solved the riddle of Rack’s failure 



to finish what he had started. 

It was conceivable that De Grasse 
should have acted as he did for 
reasons of sentiment; but to apply 
the same motive to Rack was simply 
not possible. The man had emo- 
tions, certainly, but they were all 
channeled into one direction: the 
destiny of the human race and of 
Lawrence Rack. De Grasse was at 
an age when the strongest emotions 
were volatile, when conversions 
were made, when a man could plan 
an assassination one day and enter 
a monastery the next. But Rack was 
fixed and aimed, like a cannon. 

Ferguson was saying, “He must 
be going soft. Going soft — old Rack. 
Unless it’s the hand of God. What’s 
your opinion, Father?” 

The priest said blandly, “Mr. 
Ferguson, since I have come to live 





upon this planet, my opinions have 
changed about many things. I no 
longer believe that either God, or 
man, is quite so simple as I once 
thought. We were too small in our 
thoughts, before — our understand- 
ing of temporal things was bounded 
by the frontiers of Earth, and of 
eternal things by the little sky we 
could see from our windows. 

“Before, I think I would have 
tried to answer your question. I 
would have said that I think Cap- 
tain Rack was moved by — a sudden 
access of human feeling — or I 
would have said that I think Cap- 
tain Rack was touched by the fin- 
ger of God. Perhaps I would have 
hesitated to say that, because even 
then I did not believe that God in- 
terferes with the small sins of men 
like Captain Rack. Or the small 
sins of anybody, for that matter.” 

Ferguson grinned. “Well, Father, 
that’s the best excuse for an answer 
I ever heard, anyway.” He dragged 
on his cigar, narrowing his eyes and 
pursing his lips, as if the cigar were 
a tube through which his brains 
were being sucked. “In other 
words,” he said, “you don’t think 
the big blowup back home was a 
judgment on us for our sins. You 
think it was a good thing, only 
more people 'should have got out 
the way we did. That right?” 

“Oh, no,” said Father Exarkos. 
“I believe that the Famines and the 
Collapse were a judgment of God. 
I have heard many theories about 
the causes of the Collapse, but I 
have not heard one which does not 
come back, in the end, to a con- 
demnation of man’s folly, cruelty, 
and blindness.” 

“Well,” said Ferguson, “excuse 
me. Father, but if you believe that 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



way, what are you doing here? Back 
there — ” he jerked his head, as if 
Earth were some little distance be- 
hind his right shoulder — “people 
are living like animals. Chicago, 
where I come from, is just a stone 
jungle, with a few beast-like scav- 
engers prowling around in it. If the 
dirt and disease don’t get you, some 
bandit will split your head open, or 
you’ll run into a wolf or some other 
hungry animal. If none of those 
things happen, you can expect to 
live to the ripe old age of forty, and 
then you’ll be glad to die.” 

He had stopped smiling. Fergu- 
son, Cudyk realized, was describing 
his own personal hell. He went on, 
“Now, if you want to call that a 
judgment, I won’t argue with you. 
But if that’s what you believe, why 
aren’t you back there taking it with 
the rest of them?” 

He really wanted to know, Cudyk 
thought. He had begun by trying 
to bait the priest, but now he was 
serious. It was odd to think of Fer- 
guson having trouble with his con- 
science, but Cudyk was not really 
surprised. The most moralistic men 
he had ever known had been gang- 
sters of Ferguson’s type; whereas 
the few really good men he had 
known, Father Exarkos among 
them, had seemed as blithely un- 
aware of their consciences as of 
their healthy livers. 

The priest said, soberly, “Mr. 
Ferguson, I believe that we also are 
being punished. Perhaps we more 
than others. The Mexican peon, the 
Indian fellah, the peasant of China 
or Greece, lives very much as his 
father did before him; he scarcely 
has reason to know that judgment 
has fallen upon Earth. But I think 
that no inhabitant of the Quarter 

23 




can forget it for so much as an 
hour.” 

Ferguson stared at him, then 
grunted and squashed out his cigar. 
He stood up. “I’ll be getting along 
home,” he said. “Good night.” He 
walked out. 

Gudyk and Exarkos sat for a 
while longer, talking quietly, and 
then left together. The streets were 
empty. Behind them and to their 
left as they walked to the comer, 
the ghostly blue of the Niori bee- 
hives shone above the dark human 
buildings. 

The priest lived in a small second- 
floor apartment near the comer of 
Brasil and Athenai, alone since his 
wife had died ten years before. 
Cudyk had only to go straight across 
Ceskoslovensko, but he walked 
down toward Brasil with his friend. 

Near the comer, Cudyk saw a 
dark form sprawled in a doorway. 
“One of your congregation, As- 
tereos?” he asked. 

“It is probable,” said the priest 
resignedly. “Steve Chrisudis has 
been drinking heavily again this 
past week; also the two Moulios 
brothers.” 

He stepped over and turned the 
man’s face up to the light. 

The face was bloody and broken, 
the eyes sightless. It was Harkway. 
He had been dead long enough to 
grow cold. 



O NE QUESTION of Harkway’s 
kept coming back to Cudyk. 
“Would you live in a universe 
drenched with blood?” 

Rack would, of course ; for others 
there was a tragic dilemma. For 
them, the race had come to the end 
of a road that had its beginning in 

24 



prehistory. Every step of progress 
on that way had been accomplished 
by bloodshed, and yet the goal had 
always been, a world at peace. It had 
been possible to live with the para- 
dox when the road still seemed end- 
less: before the first Earth star- 
ships discovered that humanity was 
not alone in the universe. 

Human beings were like a fragile 
crystalline structure, enduring until 
the first touch of air; or like a cyst 
that withers when it is cut open. 
The winds of the universe blew 
around them now, and there was 
no way to escape from their own 
nature. 

The way forward was the way 
back; the way back was the way 
forward. 

There was no peace except the 
peace of surrender and death. 
There was no victory except the 
victory of chaos. 

As the priest had remarked, there 
were many theories about the Col- 
lapse. It was said that the economy 
of Earth had been wrecked by in- 
terstellar imports; it was said that 
the rusts and blights that had 
devastated Earth’s fields were of 
alien origin ; it was said that the dis- 
banding of the Space Navy, after 
the Altair Incident, had broken 
Earth’s spirit. It was said that the 
emigrations, both before and after 
the Famines, had bled away too 
much of the trained manpower that 
was Earth’s life-blood. 

The clear fact was that the hu- 
man race was finished: dying like 
Neanderthal faced by Cro-Magnon; 
dying like the hairy Ainu among 
the Japanese. It was true that hun- 
dreds of millions of people lived on 
Earth much as they had done be- 
fore, tilling their fields, digging 

DAMON KNIGHT 




stones from the ground, laboring 
over the handicrafts which sus- 
tained the men of the Quarter in 
their exile. 

Humanity had passed through 
such dark ages before. 

But now there was no way to go 
except downward. 

If the exiles in their ghettoes, on 
a hundred planets of the galaxy, 
were the lopped-off head of the 
race, then the ferment of theories, 
plans, and policies that swirled 
through them stood for the last 
fitful fantasies in the brain of a 
guillotined man. 

And on Earth, the prelates, the 
robber barons, the petty princes 
were ganglia: performing their me- 
chanical functions in a counterfeit 
of intelligence, slowing, degener- 
ating imperceptibly until the last 
spark should go out. 

Gudyk fingered the manuscript 
which lay on the desk before him. 
It was the last thing he had written, 
and it would never be finished. He 
had hunted it up, this morning, out 
of nostalgia, or perhaps through 
some obscure working of that im- 
pulse that made him look out at 
the stars each night. 

There were twenty pages, the first 
chapter of a book that was to have 
been his major work. It ended with 
the words: 

“The only avenue of escape for 
humanity is . .” 

He had stopped there, because 
he had realized suddenly that he 
had been deliberately deceiving 
himself; that there was no avenue. 
The scheme he had meant to pro- 
pose and develop in the rest of the 
book had one thing in common 
with those he had demolished in the 
first pages. It would not work. 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



Cudyk thought of those phantom 
chapters now, and was grateful that 
he had not written them. He had 
meant to propose that the exiles 
should band together on some un- 
peopled planet, and rear a new 
generation which would be given all 
the knowledge of the old, save for 
two categories: military science and 
astronomy. They would never be 
told, never guess that the bright 
lights of their sky were suns, that 
the suns had planets and the planets 
people. They would grow up free 
of that numbing pressure; they 
would have a fresh start. 

It had been the grossest self-de- 
ception. You cannot put the human 
mind in chains. Every culture had 
tried it, and every culture had 
failed . 

He pulled open a drawer of his 
desk and put the manuscript into 
it. A folded note dropped to the 
floor as he did so. Cudyk picked it 
up and read again: 

You are requested to attend a 
meeting which will he held at 8 
Washington Avenue at 10 hours 
today. Matters of public policy will 
be discussed . 

It was not signed; no signature 
was needed, nor any threatened al- 
ternative to complying with the 
“request”. Cudyk glanced at his 
wristwatch, made on Oladi by 
spidery, many-limbed creatures to 
whom an ordinary watch move- 
ment was a gross mechanism. The 
dial showed the Galactic Standard 
numerals which corresponded to 
ten o’clock. 

Cudyk stood up wearily and 
walked out past the carved screen. 
He said to Nick, “I’ll be back in 
an hour or so.” 

Eight Washington Avenue was 

25 




The Little Bear, half a block from 
the comer where he had first met 
Harkway, a block and a half from 
the spot where Harkway’s corpse 
had been left in a doorway. Two 
more associations, Cudyk thought. 
After twenty-five years, there were 
so many that he could not move a 
foot in the Quarter, glance at a 
window or a wall, without encoun- 
tering one of them. And this was 
another thing to remember about 
a ghetto: you were crowded not 
only in space but in time. The liv- 
ing were the most transient in- 
habitants of the Quarter. 

Cudyk stepped through the open 
door of The Little Bear, saw the 
tables empty and the floor bare. 
The bartender, Piljurovich, jerked 
his thumb toward the stairs. 
“You’re late,” he said in Russian. 
“Better hurry.” 

Cudyk climbed the stairs to the 
huge second-floor dining hall, where 
the Russians and Poles held their 
periodic revels. The room was 
packed tight with a silent mass of 
men. At the far end, Rack sat on a 
chair placed on a table. He stopped 
in mid-sentence, stared coldly at 
Cudyk, and then went on. 

“ — or against me. From now on, 
there won’t be any more neutrals. 
I want you to understand this clear- 
ly. For one thing, your lives may 
depend on it.” 

He paused, glancing around the 
room. “By now you all know that 
James Harkway was executed last 
night. His crime was treason against 
the human race. There are some of 
you here who have been, or will be, 
guilty of the same crime. To them I 
have nothing more to say. To the 
others, those who have considered 

26 



themselves neutral, I say this: First, 
New Earth needs all of you and has 
earned your allegiance. Second, 
those of you who remain on an 
enemy planet in spite of this warn- 
ing will not live to regret it if that 
planet is selected for attack. 

“You have two months to make 
up your minds and to close your 
affairs. At the end of that time, a 
New Earth transport will call here 
to take off those who decide to go. 
It will be the last New Earth ship, 
and I warn you that you had better 
not count on Galactic transporta- 
tion after that date.” 

He stood up. “That’s all.” 

The audience was over. Rack 
waited, standing on the table, 
thumbs hooked into his belt, jacket 
over his shoulders, like a statue of 
himself, while the crowd moved 
slowly out of the room. It was 
ludicrous, but you could not laugh. 

Two months. For almost twenty 
years Rack had been a minor dis- 
turbance in the Quarter, no more 
important or dangerous or mad 
than a dozen others; appearing sud- 
denly, at night, staying for a few 
days, disappearing again for a 
month, or two, or six. He brought 
stolen goods to Ferguson — furs 
from Drux Uta, perhaps, or jewels 
from Thon — and Ferguson paid 
him in Galactic currency, reselling 
the merchandise later, some on 
Palumbar, some on a dozen other 
worlds, for twenty times the price 
he paid. Rack had a following 
among the younger men of the 
Quarter; two or three a year joined 
him. Occasionally there were ru- 
mors in the Quarter of Rack’s close 
calls with the Galactic Guard. It 
had never been a secret that he 
was building military installations 

DAMON KNIGHT 




on some far-off planet. But now, for 
the first time, Cudyk realized that 
Rack was actually going to make 
war on the universe. 

Whatever the result, the least it 
meant was the end of the Quarter. 

The stairs were choked. Cudyk 
worked his way down, to find the 
barroom filled with little knots of 
men, talking in low voices. Only a 
few were drinking. 

Someone called his name, and 
then a hand grasped his sleeve. It 
was Speros Moulios, the grey little 
tobacco dealer, whose two sons 
drank too much. “Mr. Cudyk, 
please, what do you think? Should 
we go, like he says?” 

The others of the group followed 
him; in a moment Cudyk was sur- 
rounded. He felt helpless. “I can’t 
advise you, Mr. Moulios,” he said. 
“To be truthful, I don’t know what 
I am going to do myself.” 

Nobilio Villaneuva, the druggist, 
said, “I have worked fifteen years, 
saved all my money. What am I 
going to do with it if I go to this 
New Earth? And what about my 
daughter?” 

Someone came elbowing his way 
through the crowd. He signaled to 
Cudyk. “Laszlo!” It was bald, 
cheerful Mike Moskowitz, one of 
the Quarter’s two doctors. He said, 
“Some of the fellows want to form 
a delegation, to go back and ask 
Rack some questions. They asked 
me to serve, but I’ve got to get back 
to the hospital. Same thing with 
Seu, he’s got six things on his hands 
already. Father Exarkos isn’t here. 
Will you take over? Good. I’ll see 
you later.” 

Cudyk sighed. The men around 
him were watching him expectantly. 
He stepped over to the bar, picked 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



up an empty glass and rapped with 
it on the counter until the room 
quieted. 

“It’s been suggested,” he said, 
“that a delegation be formed to ask 
Captain Rack for more informa- 
tion. Do you all want that?” 

There was an affirmative mur- 
mur. 

“All right,” said Cudyk. “Nomin- 
ations?” 

They ended up with a committee 
of five: Cudyk as spokesman, Mo- 
ulios, Chong Yin, the painter 
Prokop Vekshin, and the town 
clerk, Martin Paz. Cudyk had slips 
of paper passed out, and collected 
a hundred-odd questions, most of 
them duplicates and some of them 
incoherent. Paz made a neat list of 
those that remained, and the 
delegation moved toward the stairs. 



A T THE FOOT of the stairway 
Cudyk saw Burgess standing, 
blinking uncertainly around him. 
He dropped back and put his hand 
on the man’s arm. “Hello, Louis. 
I’m glad to see you. How is Kathy?” 
Burgess straightened a trifle. “Oh 
— Laszlo. She’s all right, thank 
you. Feeling a little low, just now, 
of course . .” His voice trailed off. 

“Of course,” said Cudyk sym- 
pathetically. “I wish there were 
something I could do.” 

“No — no, there’s nothing. Time 
will cure her, I suppose. Where are 
you going now?” 

Cudyk explained. “Were you at 
the meeting, earlier?” he asked. 

“No. I was not invited. I only 
heard — ten minutes ago. Perhaps it 
would be all right if I came upstairs 
with you? In that way — But if I 
would be a nuisance — ” His fea- 

27 




tures worked. 

Cudyk felt obscurely uneasy. He 
recalled suddenly that it was a long 
time since he had seen Burgess look- 
ing perfectly normal. He said re- 
luctantly, “I think it will be all 
right. Why not? Come along.” 
Rack was sitting at the end of the 
long table on the far side of the 
room, talking to Ferguson. Fergu- 
son’s hatchet-man, Vic Smalley, was 
leaning watchfully against the far 
wall. Monk and Spider sat at Rack’s 
left. De Grasse, pale and red-eyed, 
sat halfway down the table, away 
from the others. He stared at the 
table in front of him, paying no at- 
tention to the rest. 

Cudyk had heard that De Grasse 
was still with Rack, and had won- 
dered what he had done to expiate 
his sin. The obvious answer was one 
that he had not wanted to believe : 
that De Grasse had been given the 
task of murdering Harkway. 

He had done it, probably, with 
a tormented soul and under Rack’s 
eye, but he had done it. So much, 
Cudyk thought wearily, for the self- 
less nobility of man. 

Rack looked up expressionlessly 
as the five men approached. “Yes?” 
Cudyk said, “We have been 
chosen to ask you some questions 
about your previous statement.” 
“Ask away,” said Rack, leaning 
back in his chair. Before him was 
a glass of the dark, smoky liquor 
Ferguson imported for his special 
use. He was smoking a tremendous- 
ly long, black Russian cigarette. 

Cudyk took the list from Paz and 
read the first question. “What is the 
status of New Earth as to housing, 
utilities and so on?” 

“Housing and utilities are ade- 
quate for the present population,” 

28 



said Rack indifferently. “More 
units will be built as needed.” 

Paz scribbled in his notebook. 
Cudyk read, “Will every new colon- 
ist be expected to serve as a member 
of New Earth’s fighting forces?” 
Rack said, “Every man will work 
where he’s needed. Common sense 
ought to tell you that middle-aged 
men with pot bellies and no mili- 
tary training won’t be asked to 
man battleships.” 

“What is die size of New Earth’s 
navy?” 

“Next question.” 

“Will new colonists be allowed to 
retain their personal fortunes?” 
Rack stared at him coldly. “The 
man who asked that,” he said, “had 
better stay in the Quarter. If by his 
personal fortune he means Galactic 
currency, he can use it to stuff rat- 
holes. Any personal property of 
value to the community, and in ex- 
cess of the owner’s minimum needs, 
will be commandeered and dis- 
pensed for the good of the com- 
munity.” 

“Will new colonists be under mili- 
tary dis — ” 

“Look out!” said De Grasse sud- 
denly. He lurched to his feet, up- 
setting his chair. 

Someone stumbled against Paz, 
who fell heavily across Cudyk’s legs, 
bringing him down. Someone else 
shouted. From the floor, Cudyk saw 
Burgess standing quietly with a 
tiny nickeled revolver in his hand. 

“Please don’t move, Mr. Fergu- 
son,” said Burgess. “I don’t trust 
you. All of you, stand still, please.” 
Cudyk carefully got his legs un- 
der him and slowly stood up. The 
men on the other side of the table 
were still sitting or standing where 
they had been a moment before. 



DAMON KNIGHT 




De Grasse stood in an attitude of 
frozen protest, one big hand flat 
against his trousers pocket. He 
looked comically like a man who 
has left the house without his keys. 

They must have taken his gun 
away, Cudyk thought, after that 
affair yesterday. 

Monk and the aged Spider were 
sitting tensely, trying to watch Rack 
and Burgess at the same time. Rack, 
as always, was inhumanly calm. Fer- 
guson looked frightened. The gun- 
man, Vic Smalley, had straight- 
ened away from the wall; he looked 
alert and unworried. 

“Captain Rack,” said Burgess, 
“you lulled that ma n Harkway.” 

Rack said nothing. 

“I did it,” De Grasse said hoarse- 
ly. “If you have to shoot somebody, 
shoot me.” 

Burgess turned slightly. Rack, 
without seeming to hurry, picked 
up the glass in front of him and 
half rose to fling the black liquor 
at Burgess’ face. 

The gun went off. Burgess stum- 
bled back a step and then toppled 
over, with a knife-handle sprouting 
magically between neck and shoul- 
der. De Grasse came hurtling across 
the table top, dived onto Burgess’ 
prostrate body and came up with 
the gun. Not more than two seconds 
had gone by since Rack lifted the 
glass. 

The delegates were moving away, 
leaving a clear space around De 
Grasse and Burgess. Cudyk heard 
some of them clattering down the 
stairs. 

Rack was leaning over the table, 
supporting himself with one hand, 
while the other rested at his waist. 
His attitude, together with his froz- 
en expression, suggested that he 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



was merely bending over to examine 
Burgess’ body. But in the next mo- 
ment he turned slightly, lifted the 
hand that was pressed to his side, 
and looked at die dark stain that 
was spreading over his shirt. 

De Grasse stood up. Cudyk went 
to Burgess and knelt beside him. 
The man was conscious and moving 
feebly. “Lie still,” said Cudyk. 
Someone pushed his shoulder 
roughly, and he looked up to see 
De Grasse transferring the revolver 
from his left hand to his right. The 
youngster’s lips were compressed. 
“Get out of the way,” he said 
harshly. 

“No,” said Rack. “Leave him 
alone.” He sat down carefully. After 
a moment De Grasse went around 
the table and joined him. 

Cudyk lifted Burgess’ jacket care- 
fully. There was not much bleed- 
ing, and he did not think the wound 
was dangerous. Burgess said weakly, 
“Did I kill him, Laszlo?” 

“No,” said Cudyk. “No one was 
killed.” 

Burgess turned his head away. 

There were footsteps on the 
stairs, and Moskowitz came into 
the room, followed by Lee Far and 
two men with a stretcher. Mosko- 
witz glanced at Burgess and at 
Rack, then knelt beside Burgess 
without a word. He pulled out the 
knife expertly, pressing a wad of 
bandage around the wound. 

“I’ll take that,” said Spider, 
bending over with his grey hand 
outstretched. 

Moskowitz dropped the knife on 
the floor and went on bandaging 
Burgess. Spider picked it up, glared 
at the doctor and went back around 
the table. 

Cudyk waited until Moskowitz 

29 




had finished with Burgess and 
started probing for the bullet in 
Rack’s side. Following the stretcher 
bearers down the stairs, he went 
out into the clear morning sunlight. 

There was never any end to it. 
The Quarter was like a tight gravi- 
tational system, with many small 
bodies swinging around each other 
in eccentric orbits, and the whole 
shrinking in upon itself as time 
went on, so that it grew more and 
more certain that one collision 
would engender half a dozen more. 

And in the mind, too, each event 
went on forever. Cudyk remem- 
bered Burgess, in the stretcher as he 
was being carried home, weeping 
silently because he had failed to 
kill the man who had murdered 
his daughter’s lover. And he re- 
membered Rack, sitting silent and 
weary as he waited for Moskowitz 
to attend to him: sitting without 
anger for the man who had shot 
him, sitting with patience, filled 
with his own inner strength. 

And De Grasse, tortured soul, 
who had once more shown himself 
willing to sacrifice himself to any 
loyalty he felt. 

Even Monk, even Spider, lived 
not for himself but for Rack. 

There were all the traditional 
virtues, dripping their traditional 
gore : nobility, self-sacrifice, pa- 

tience, even generosity. By any test 
except the test of results, Rack was 
a great man and Burgess another. 

And the test of results was a 
two-edged razor: for by that test, 
Cudyk himself was a total failure, a 
nonentity. 

He thought, We are the hollow 
men , we are the stuffed men . 

When every action led to disas- 

30 



ter, those who did nothing were 
damned equally with those who 
acted. 



S OMEONE touched Cudyk’s 
arm as he left Chong Yin’s. He 
turned and saw that it was Fergu- 
son. 

“I’ve got something to say to you, 
Cudyk. I saw you were busy talking 
to Father Exarkos in there, so I 
didn’t bother you. Besides, it’s pri- 
vate. Come on down to my place.” 
The man was doing him an 
honor, Cudyk realized, in ap- 
proaching him personally instead of 
sending an underling. And now, as 
Ferguson stood waiting for him to 
reply, Cudyk saw that there was 
something curiously like appeal in 
his eyes. 

“All right, if you wish,” he said. 
“But I will have to go back to the 
shop within an hour — Nick has not 
had his lunch.” 

“I won’t keep you that long,” 
Ferguson said. 

They turned at the corner and 
walked down Washington, past 
Town Hall to The Little Bear. Be- 
yond this point, everything was Fer- 
guson’s : the dance hall, the casino, 
the bawdy house, the two cafes and 
three bars, and the two huge ware- 
houses at the end of the avenue. 
But it was the casino that Ferguson 
meant when he said “my place”. 

A white-aproned boy got up hur- 
riedly and opened the heavy doors 
when they approached. Ferguson 
strode past without looking at him, 
and Cudyk followed across the 
long, empty room. Dust covers 
shrouded the roulette table, the 
chuck-a-luck layout, faro, chemin- 
de-fer, dice and poker tables. The 

DAMON KNIGHT 




bar was deserted, bottles and glasses 
neatly stacked. 

Ferguson led the way up a short 
flight of stairs to the overhanging 
balcony at the end of the room. He 
opened the door with a key — a 
rarity in the Quarter, since cylinder 
locks were available only by scav- 
enging on Earth, and had to be 
imported, whereas a mechanism 
used by the Niori as a mathemati- 
cal toy could be readily adapted in- 
to an efficient combination lock. 

The low-ceilinged room was 
furnished with a blond-wood desk 
and swivel chair, a long, pale green 
couch and two chairs upholstered 
in the same fabric: all Earth im- 
ports, scavenged from stocks manu- 
factured before the Collapse. The 
carpet was a deeper green. There 
were three framed pictures on the 
walls : a blue-period Picasso, a 

muted oyster- white and grey Utril- 
lo and a small Roualt clown. 

Ferguson was watching him. 
“Just like my place in Chicago,” he 
said. “You never saw it before, did 
you?” 

“No,” Cudyk said. “I have never 
been in the Casino until now.” 

“Sit down,” said Ferguson, point- 
ing to one of the upholstered chairs. 
He pulled out the swivel chair and 
leaned back in it. He nodded to- 
ward the glass which formed the 
entire front wall of the room. “Sit- 
tin’ up here, I can see everything 
that goes on downstairs. I got a 
phone — ” he laid his hand on it — 
“that communicates with the 
cashier’s booth in every room. I can 
handle the whole place from here, 
and I don’t have to be bothered by 
the goofs if I don’t want to. Also, 
that glass is bullet proof. It’s Niori 
stuff, ten times better than any- 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



thing we had back home. They tell 
me you couldn’t get through it with 
a bazooka.” 

Cudyk said nothing. 

“What I wanted to talk to you 
about — ” said Ferguson, leaning 
forward with his elbows on his 
knees. “You understand, Cudyk, 
this is confidential. Strictly between 
us.” 

“I don’t want any confidence 
that will be difficult to keep,” said 
Cudyk. 

“What do you mean?” 

“If it is something that touches 
the safety of the Quarter — ” 

Ferguson waved his hand impa- 
tiently. “No, it’s nothing like 
that. I just don’t want it to get 
around too early. All right, use 
your own judgment. Here it is.” 
“Rack’s coming back in about 
three weeks with his transport, to 
pick up anybody that wants to go 
to New Earth. I’m not going, and 
neither are any of my boys. On the 
other hand, I’m not going to stay 
here either. It isn’t healthy any 
more.” 

“I don’t know what Rack’s got, 
but I’ve got a pretty good idea he’s 
got enough to raise a lot of hell. 
Now you can figure the angles for 
yourself : maybe he won’t bomb 
this planet because he thinks he 
can still make some use of the 
Quarter — but that’s a big maybe. 
Even if he doesn’t, it’s a dead cinch 
there’s going to be trouble. The 
Niori know he comes here, even if 
they can’t prove it, and when the 
war starts they’re going to be sore.” 
“Tell me something,” said Cu- 
dyk after a moment. “If you knew 
all this long ago — and you must 
have, since you have been so closely 
associated with Rack — why did you 

31 




help Rack, and so force yourself to 
leave Palumbar?” 

Ferguson grinned and shrugged. 
“I’m not complaining,” he said. 
“Rack never fooled me. I got mine, 
and he got his — it was a business 
arrangement. When you figure 
everything in, I can clear out now 
and I’m still ahead. See, you got to 
figure that nothing lasts forever. If 
I hadn’t played along with Rack, 
he would have taken his business 
somewhere else. Maybe I could 
have stayed here a little longer, but 
then again, maybe I would have 
stayed too long. This way, I got my 
information in advance, and I got 
my profit from dealing with Rack. 

“As a matter of fact, he thinks I 
and all my outfit are going to be on 
that transport when it goes back to 
his base. He knows I wouldn’t take 
a chance on staying here when the 
shooting starts. What he doesn’t 
know is that I got someplace else to 
go, and a way to get there.” 

He sat back in his chair again. “I 
got a Niori-built freighter hidden 
back in the hills. Had it for eight 
years now. It’ll carry five hundred 
people, and fuel and provisions for 
a year, on top of the cargo. And I 
got a planet picked out where no- 
body will bother me — not Rack, 
and not the Galactics.” 

He took a cigar box from the 
desk and offered it to Gudyk. Cu- 
dyk shook his head, showing his 
pipe. 

Ferguson took a cigar, twirled it 
in his lips slowly, and lit it. “You 
know,” he said, bending forward, 
“there’s plenty of planets in the 
galaxy that aren’t inhabited. Some 
have never even been explored. 
They’re off the shipping routes, no 

32 




intelligent race on them, nothing 
special in the way of organic pro- 
ducts, so nobody wants them. 
Rack’s got one — I’ve got another.” 

He gestured with the cigar. “But 
I’m not using mine to build up any 
war base. What for?” His long face 
contorted with violent disgust. 
“That Rack is crazy. You know it 
and I know it. If it wasn’t for him, 
I could have stayed here, who 
knows how long? Or I could have 
moved to one of the other colonies 
if I saw a good chance. I like it 
here. This is civilization — all that’s 
left of it. 

“But — ” he leaned back again — 
“you got to take what you can get. 
If the odds are too heavy, cash in 
and walk out. That’s what I’m do- 
ing: I’m retiring. On this planet I 
told you about, there’s a big island. 
A tropical island. Fruit — all you 
can eat. Little animals something 
like wild pigs. Fish in the ocean. 

DAMON KNIGHT 



Gravity just a little under Earth 
normal, atmosphere perfect. And 
I’m taking along everything else 
we’ll need. Generators, all kinds of 
electrical equipment, stoves, every- 
thing. It’ll last your lifetime and 
mine.” 

He looked at Cudyk. “What 
more would you want?” 

Cudyk said slowly, “You’re ask- 
ing me to go with you?” 

Ferguson nodded. “Sure. I’ll 
treat you right, Cudyk. My boys 
will go on working for me, you un- 
derstand, and so will most of the 
others I’m going to take. I’ll be the 
boss. But you, and three or four 
others, you won’t have to do any 
work. Just lie in that sand, or go 
fishing, or whatever you feel like. 
How does it sound?” 

“I don’t think I quite under- 
stand,” said Cudyk. “Why do you 
choose me?” 

Ferguson put down his cigar. He 
looked uncomfortable. He said ir- 
ritably, “Because I’ve got to have 
somebody to talk to.” He stared at 
Cudyk. “Look at me. Here I am, 
I’m fifty years old, and I been fight- 
ing the world ever since I was a kid. 
You think I can just cut loose from 
everything now, and lie under a 
tree? I’d go nuts in a month. I’m 
not kidding myself, I know what I 
am. It takes practice to learn how 
to relax and enjoy yourself. I never 
learned, never had the time. 

“When I get on that island, and 
I get all the houses built and the 
wires strung up, and everything’s 
organized and I’ve got nothing else 
to do, I can see myself lying there 
thinking about this place, and all 
the other places I ever owned, and 
thinking to myself, ‘What for?’ And 
there’s no answer, I know that. But 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



just the same, I’m going to be 
wanting to start in again, making a 
deal, opening a joint, figuring the 
angles, handling people. 

“So there I’ll be, with all these 
mugs around me. What do they 
know to talk about? The same 
things I do. Things that happened 
to them in the rackets, here or back 
on Earth. You got to talk to some- 
body, or you go crazy. But if I’ve 
got nobody but them to talk to, 
how’m I ever going to get my mind 
off that kind of stuff?” 

He gestured toward the Roualt, 
on the wall to Cudyk’s left. “Look 
at that,” he said. “I bought that 
thing in 1991. I’ve been looking at 
it for, let’s see, twenty-three years. 
For the first five or so I couldn’t 
figure out whether the guy was kid- 
ding or not. Then, gradually, I got 
to like it. But I still don’t know 
why the hell I like it. It’s the same 
thing with everything. I have a 
Corot that I’m nuts about — I look 
at it every night before I go to sleep. 
It’s just a landscape, like you used 
to see on calendars in the old days, 
except the calendars were junk and 
this is art. I know that, I can feel 
it. But what’s the difference be- 
tween the two? Don’t ask me. 

“See what I mean? That’s the 
kind of stuff I got to learn about. 
Art. Literature. Music. Philosophy. 
I always wanted to, before, but I 
never had the patience for it. Now 
I’ve got to do it. My kind of life is 
finished, I’ve got to learn a new 
kind.” 

He frowned at his cigar. “It 
isn’t going to be easy. Maybe 
there’ll be times when you’ll wish 
you had anybody else in the world 
around but me. But I won’t take it 
out on you, Cudyk.” 



33 




He meant it, Cudyk knew. For a 
moment he wondered, Why don’t 
I accept? He could see Ferguson’s 
island paradise clearly enough : the 
tropical trees, the log huts — with 
electric light, induction stoves for 
cooking, and hot and cold water — 
the sand, the sunshine, the long, 
lazy afternoons spent in talking 
quietly on the beach. There would 
be no strain and no tension, if 
everything went as Ferguson 
planned — only a long, slow twi- 
light, with nothing left to fear or to 
hope for: forgetfulness, lethargy; 
lotos and Lethe; a pleasant exile, a 
scented prison. 

“You won’t have to worry about 
the others, the guys that work for 
me,” Ferguson said. “After they get 
through building the settlement, 
they can do what they want as long 
as they don’t make any trouble. 
There’ll be enough women to go 
around — they can settle down and 
raise kids. There won’t be any 
liquor, and I’m going to keep the 
weapons locked up. About the ship 
— I’ll wreck that as soon as we land. 
Once we’re there, we’re there.” 

If it were not for Ferguson him- 
self, Cudyk thought, I believe I 
might do it. But Ferguson, inside a 
year, is going to be a pitiable and 
terrible object. This is his own 
punishment, his lesser evil — he 
chooses it himself. But he is not go- 
ing to like it. 

“I think I understand,” he said. 
“Believe me, Mr. Ferguson, I’m 
deeply grateful for this offer, and 
I am tempted to accept. But — I 
think I will stay and take my 
chances with the Quarter.” 

Ferguson stared at him, then 
shrugged. “Don’t make up your 
mind in too much of a hurry,” he 

34 



said. “Think it over — I’m not leav- 
ing for a couple of weeks. And 
listen, Cudyk, do me a favor. Don’t 
spread this around.” 

“Very well,” said Cudyk. 
Ferguson did not get up to see 
him to the door. 



T HERE WAS a curious feeling 
of suspension in the Quarter. 
Trade was slow; only a few Niori 
and still fewer members of other 
Galactic races strolled down the 
narrow streets, and for more than 
a week Cudyk sold nothing. \ 

Human faces were missing, too. 
Almost two hundred of the ghetto’s 
inhabitants had left quietly, during 
the night, when word had gone 
around that the “New Earth”^ 
transport was waiting. Villanueva 
had gone, with his family; so had’j 
Martin Paz; and Ferguson had 
gone earlier with all his crew. To-' 
day, two weeks later, Cudyk had 
spent the morning wandering the 
City. It was a thing he had done 
often in his first years on the planet, 
before the restless drive of his youth 
had seeped away, leaving nothing 
but momentum, and memory, and 
a few vestiges that reminded him 
of the man he had been. 

He had spent whole days in the 
City, then, looking into this building 
and that, talking to the natives, ask- 
ing questions, observing. He had 
seen the City as part of a colossal 
jigsaw puzzle from which, if you 
were patient and perceptive, you 
might extract the nexus, the inner 
pattern that made the essential dif- 
ference between Niori and men. 

For the Niori, like nearly all the 
intelligent races of the galaxy, had 
one survival factor that men had 

DAMON KNIGHT 




always lacked. There was no word 
for it in any human language; you 
could only talk around it in nega- 
tives. The Niori did not kill; they 
did not lie; they did not steal, in- 
trigue, exploit each other, hate, 
make war. 

For men, “the fittest” had always 
been the man, or nation, or race, 
that survived by exterminating its 
rivals. Somehow, the Niori had 
found another way. There was no 
word for it. But perhaps you could 
find it, if you looked long enough. 

He had studied their architec- 
ture, and pondered long on the ar- 
rangement of the City’s great hive- 
buildings: a peculiar, staggered ar- 
rangement which was neither con- 
centric nor radial; which created 
no endless vistas, only islands of 
buildings or lakes of parkland. He 
had tried to see into that arrange- 
ment and through it to the soul of 
the race, as other scholars had 
peered into the city-plans of Athens 
and New York, reading inwardness 
into one and outwardness into the 
other. 

The method was sterile. The 
Niori had no “world-view” in the 
Spenglerian sense. Their cities ex- 
pressed only function and a sense 
of beauty and order. 

In those early days, he had said 
to himself: These people have no 
cinemas, theaters, churches, art gal- 
leries, concert halls, football fields. 
Let me see what they have instead, 
and perhaps I will begin to under- 
stand them. 

He had seen the Niori, sitting in 
a circle of six or eight, solemnly 
capping one word with another, 
around and around. To him, the 
sequences of words were sense-free 
and followed no discernable pat- 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



tern. To the Niori, evidently, they 
fulfilled some function analagous to 
those of poetry and group singing. 

He had watched them debating 
in the governing council. There was 
no rhetoric and no heat, even when 
the issue was important and the 
opinions widely divergent. He had 
seen their shops, in which each 
article was labeled with its cost to 
the merchant, and the buyer gave 
as much more as he could afford. It 
was incredible ; but it worked. 

He had followed their culture 
through a thousand other avenues 
until he wearied of it, having 
learned nothing more than he knew 
at the beginning. Afterwards, for 
twenty years he had not left the 
Quarter except to transact business, 
or to oversee the unloading of mer- 
chandise at the spaceport. 

Today he had gone once more, 
feeling an obscure compulsion: 
perhaps because he knew the day 
was coming when he would see the 
City for the last time ; perhaps hop- 
ing, in that small spark of himself 
that still allowed itself to hope for 
anything, that one more visit would 
show him the miraculous key to all 
that he had misunderstood. 

He had learned nothing new, but 
the morning had not been alto- 
gether wasted. It was a clear au- 
tumn day, good for walking in so 
green a city. And paradoxically 
enough, being the only Earthman 
on the streets had made him feel 
less alien than before. He attracted 
no attention, in a spaceport city: 
he walked side by side with squat 
Dritik and spidery Oladsa, beings 
of a hundred different races from as 
many stars. When he returned to 
the Quarter, he felt oddly refreshed 
and calmed. 

35 




We have very little left, he 
thought, except one or two minor 
virtues that have no bloodstains on 

them. Kindliness, humor, a sense 
of brotherhood . perhaps if we 
had stuck to those, and never 
learned the martial virtues, never 
aspired to be noble or glorious, we 
would have come out all right. Was 
there ever a turning point? When 
Carthage was sown with salt, or 
when Paul founded the Church — 
or when the first caveman sharp- 
ened the end of a stick and used 
it for murder? If so, it was a long 
way back, dead and buried, dust 
and ashes. 

We took all that was best in thou- 
sands of years of yearning and striv- 
ing for the right, he thought, and 
we made it into the Inquisition and 
the Star Chamber and the NKVD. 
We fattened our own children for 
each generation’s slaughter. And 
yet we are not all evil. Astereos is 
right: if the other races had been 
like ourselves, it would have been 
bearable; or if we ourselves had 
been creatures of pure darkness, 
conscienceless, glorying in cruelty — 
then we could have made war on 
the Galaxy joyfully, and if we failed 
at least there would have been an 
element of grandeur in our failure. 

Olaf Stapledon had said this 
once, he remembered — that there 
was an artistry in pure, uncontami- 
nated evil, that it was in its own 
way as real an expression of wor- 
ship as pure good. 

The tragedy of human beings, 

then, was that they were not wholly 
tragic. Jumbled, piebald parcels of 
contradictions, angels with asses’ 
ears. What was that quotation 
from Bierce? The best thing is not 
to be born . 



Someone brushed by him, and 
Cudyk looked up. He was at the in- 
tersection of Ceskoslovensko and 
Washington; he had come three 
blocks past his apartment without 
noticing where he was going. 

Chong Yin’s was only a few doors 
to his left; perhaps he had been 
heading there automatically. But 
the doors were closed, he saw; 
seven or eight Chinese were stand- 
ing in the street outside, and as 
Cudyk watched, Seu Min came 
down the stairs from the living 
quarters over the tea room. The 
other Chinese clustered around him 
for a moment, and then Seu ap- 
peared again. The others slowly be- 
gan to disperse. 

Cudyk went to meet him. The 
mayor’s face looked strained; there 
were new, deep folds of skin around 
his eyes. “What is it, Min?” said 
Cudyk. 

Seu fell in beside him and they 
walked back up the street. “Chong 
killed himself about an hour ago,” 
said the Chinese. 

How many does that make? Cu- 
dyk thought, frozen. Six, I think, in 
the last two months. 

He had not known Chong well — 
the old man had been a north- 
country Chinese, not Westernized 
in the least, who spoke only his 
own language. Now that he thought 
of it, Cudyk realized that he did 
not know who Chong’s close friends 
had been, if he had had any. He 
had always been the same spare, 
stooped figure in skull-cap and 
robe, courteous, unobtrusive, self- 
contained. He had a family; a wife, 
rarely seen, and six children. 

Somehow Cudyk felt that he 
would have been less surprised to 
hear that Moulios had committed 



36 



DAMON KNIGHT 




suicide, or Moskowitz, or even Seu 
himself. My mistake, he told him- 
self. I allowed myself to think of 
Chong as an institution, not as a 
man. 

“Have you some whisky?” asked 
Seu abruptly. 

“Yes,” said Cudyk, “of course.” 

“Let us go and drink it,” Seu 
said. “I’m very tired.” 

It occurred to Cudyk that he had 
never heard Seu say that before. 
They turned the corner at Athenai 
and climbed the stairs to his apart- 
ment. Seu sighed, and dropped 
heavily into a chair while Cudyk 
went to get the bottle and glasses. 

“Straight, or with water?” he 
asked. 

“Straight, please.” Seu tilted his 
glass, swallowed and shuddered. 
Cudyk watched him in silence. 

Seu, alone in the Quarter, owned 
a Niori communicator — an elabo- 
rate mechanism which reproduced 
sound, vision in three dimensions, 
odors, modulated temperature 
changes and several other things 
perceptible only to Niori. There was 
no restriction on their sale, and 
they were cheap enough, but the 
Niori broadcasts were as dull or as 
incomprehensible to men as a Ter- 
restial breakfast program would 
have been to Niori. Seu used his as 
a source of Galactic news. Today, 
Cudyk guessed, the news had been 
very bad. 

“It’s Rack, isn’t it?” he said 
finally. 

Seu glanced at him and nodded. 
“Yes, it’s Rack. I haven’t told any- 
one else about it yet. The Quarter’s 
in a half-hysterical state as it is. 
But if you don’t mind my talking it 
out to you — ” 

“Go ahead,” said Cudyk. 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



“It’s worse than anything we ex- 
pected.” Seu took another swallow 
of the whisky, and made a face. He 
said, “They’ve got a hydrogen- 
lithium bomb.” 

“. I was afraid of that.” 

Seu went on as if he had not 
heard. “But they’re not using it on 
planets. They’re bombing suns, 
Laszlo. 

For a moment, Cudyk did not 
understand, then he felt his ab- 
dominal muscles contract like a 
fist. “They couldn’t,” he said 
hoarsely. “It would explode before 
it got past the outer layers.” 

“Under faster-than-light drive?” 
Seu asked. “I did some figuring. At 
1000 C, it would take the bomb 
about two point six thousandths of 
a second to travel from the surface 
to the center of an average G-class 
star. I think that is a short enough 
interval, but maybe it isn’t. Maybe 
they have also found some way to 
increase the efficiency of the stand- 
ard galactic drive for short periods. 
Anyway, does it matter?” He 
looked at Cudyk again. “I have 
seen the pictures. I saw it happen.” 
Cudyk’ s throat was dry. “Which 
stars?” he said. 

“Torkas. Rud-Uri. That’s the 
Oladi sun. And Gerzion. Those 
three, so far.” 

Cudyk’s fingers were nervously 
caressing the smooth metal of his 
wristwatch. He looked down at it 
suddenly, remembering that the 
Oladsa had made it. And now they 
were gone, all but their colonies and 
travelers on other worlds, and those 
who had been in space at the time. 
All those spidery, meticulous 
people, with their million-year-old 
culture and their cities of carved 

37 




opal, wiped out as a man would 
swat a fly. 

Seu took another drink. His face 
flushed, and drops of sweat stood 
out on his forehead and cheeks. 

He said, “They’ll have to learn 
to kill, now. There isn’t any al- 
ternative. They intercepted one of 
the New Earth ships and sprayed 
it with the stasis field. It didn’t 
work; the ship got away. They’ll 
have to learn to kill. Do you know 
what that means?” 

“Yes.” 

Seu drank again. His face was 
fiery red, now, and he was gasping 
for breath. “I can’t get drunk,” he 
said bitterly. “Toxic reaction. I 
thought I’d try once more, but it’s 
no good. Laszlo, look out, I’m go- 
ing to be sick.” 

Gudyk led him to the lavatory. 
When he came out, the Chinese was 
weak and waxen-pale. Cudyk tried 
tp persuade him to rest on the bed, 
but he refused. “I’ve got to get back 
to my office,” he said. “Been gone 
too long already. Help me down the 
stairs, will you, Laszlo?” 

Cudyk walked him as far as 
Brasil and Washington, where two 
of Seu’s young men took over with 
voluble expressions of gratitude. 
Cudyk watched the group until it 
disappeared into the town hall. 

He could feel nothing but an arid 
depression. Even the horror at 
Rack’s mass-murders, even his pity 
for Seu was blunted, sealed off at 
the back of his mind. The lives of 
saints, Cudyk remembered, spoke of 
“boundless compassion”, “infinite 
pity”; but an ordinary man had a 
limited supply. When it was used 
up, you were empty and impotent, 
a canceled sign in the human equa- 
tion. 



Half instinctively, half by choice, 
Cudyk had chosen his friends 
among the strongest and most pa- 
tient, the wise and cynical : the sur- 
vivors. But he had leaned too much 
on their strength, he realized now. 
He had seen Seu crumble; and he 
felt as if a crutch had broken under 
his weight. 

That evening he opened his shut- 
ters and looked out at the sky. The 
familiar constellations were there, 
unchanged. The light of the nearest 
star took more than three years to 
reach Palumbar. But in his mind’s 
eye one glittering pinpoint exploded 
suddenly into a dreadful blossom of 
radiance; then another; then a 
third. And he saw the blackened 
corpses of planets swinging around 
each, murdered by that single flash 
of incredible heat. 

During the night he dreamed of 
a black wasteland, and of Rack 
standing motionless in the center of 
it, brooding, with his cold grey face 
turned to the stars. 



I T WAS Cudyk’s birthday. He 
had never told anyone in the 
Quarter the date, and had all but 
forgotten it himself. This morning, 
feeling an idle desire to know what 
the season was on Earth, he had 
hunted up a calendar he had last 
used twenty years ago; it translated 
the Niori system into Gregorian 
years, months and days. The result, 
when he had worked it out with 
some little trouble, was February 
18th. He was fifty-six. 

Now he was constrained to won- 
der whether the action had been as 
random as it seemed. Was it possi- 
ble that subconsciously he had no 
need of the calendar — that he had 



38 



DAMON KNIGHT 




kept track, all these years, and had 
known when his birthday came? If 
so, why had he felt it necessary to 
remind himself in this oblique way? 

A return to the womb? A hunger 
for the comforts of the family circle, 
the birthday cake, candles, the sol- 
ace of yearly repetition? 

Cudyk was fifty-six. When he had 
been fifty-five, he had thought of 
himself as a man in his middle 
years, still strong, still able. Now he 
was old. The same thing had hap- 
pened to Seu: he had recovered 
from his first shock when the news 
had come about Rack, and for 
more than three weeks now he had 
moved about the Quarter, as quiet 
and as competent as before; but 
there was a difference. His swift, 
furtive humor was gone except for 
rare flashes; his voice and his step 
were heavy. 

It was the same with all of them, 
all the old settlers. Cudyk had met 
Burgess on the street the day before, 
for the first time in several weeks, 
and had been genuinely shocked. 
The man’s hair was white, his skin 
papery, his gait stumbling. 

Even Exarkos showed the change. 
More and more of his grey, woolly 
hair was vanishing. The umber 
crescents under his eyes were a 
deeper shade, almost black. 

The Quarter’s graveyard was five 
acres of ground, surrounded by 
trees, on the outskirts of the City; 
there the dead reclined in a more 
ample space than the living en- 
joyed. The Niori had allotted the 
ground, though the outline of the 
City was thereby disfigured, and 
had contributed slabs of a synthetic 
stone which carved easily when it 
was fresh, later hardening until it 
would resist any edged tool. The 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



plot was ill tended, but the standing 
stones, translucent pearl or rose, 
had a certain beauty. To the Niori, 
the purpose of the graveyard was 
only that; they were not equipped 
to understand mankind’s morbid 
clinging to its own carrion. 

Cudyk had gone to Chong’s 
funeral, presided over by Lee Yuk, 
the asthmatic little Buddhist priest ; 
and the image of those ranked head- 
stones, neatly separated into the 
Orthodox, the Protestants, the 
Buddhists, the Taoists and the un- 
believers, had returned to him many 
times since. It was another sign of 
the change that was taking place in 
him: the images which formerly 
had dominated his mind had been 
pictographs of abstractions — the 
great globe of infinity, the tiny 
spark that was creative intellect. 
Now they were the pale headstone 
and the dark curtain of death. 

He had felt nothing, standing 
over Chong’s grave and watching 
the sod fall. What is there to say 
about a man when he is dead? The 
priest’s words were false, as all such 
words are false; they had no rele- 
vance; the man was dead. Nothing 
was left of him now but the dis- 
solving molecules of his flesh, and 
the fragmentary, ego-distorted 
memories he had planted in the 
minds of others. He was a name 
written in water. 

It was not Chong who obsessed 
Cudyk, nor the many other half- 
remembered men and women whose 
names were clumsily carved on 
those stones. It was the cemetery as 
a symbol: the fascination of the 
yawning void. 

Cudyk had one other preoccupa- 
tion: he thought often of Earth, a 
dark globe turning, black continents 

39 




dim against the grey ocean, 
pricked by a few faint gleams that 
were cities. Or, if he thought of the 
eities, he saw them too drowned in 
shadow: the shapes of tower and 
arch melting into night-patterns; 
moonlight falling faintly, dissolving 
what it touched, so that shadows be- 
came as solid stone, stone as in- 
substantial mist. 

For Earth, also, was a symbol of 
death. 

There had been no more suicides 
since Chong had died, and no riots. 
It seemed to Cudyk that the whole 
Quarter moved, like himself, 
through a fluid heavier than air. All 
motion had slowed, and sounds 
came muted and without resonance. 
People spoke to him, and he an- 
swered, but without attention, as if 
they were not really there. 

Even the recent news about 
Rack’s defeat had stirred him only 
momentarily, and he had seen in 
Seu’s face that the Chinese felt him- 
self somehow inadequate to the tale 
even as he told it. The Galactic 
fleet, vastly expanded, had met 
Rack’s activist forces with a new 
weapon — one, indeed, which did 
not kill, but which was shameful 
enough to a citizen of the Galaxy. 
The weapon projected a field which 
scrambled the synapse patterns in 
the brain, leaving its victim incapa- 
ble of any of the processes of co- 
herent thought: incapable of add- 
ing two figures, of lighting a ciga- 
rette, or of aiming a torpedo. Eleven 
New Earth ships had been cap- 
tured, and it was thought that these 
were all the activists’ armed vessels ; 
there had been no further attacks 
since then. 

He did not believe that anything 
which could now possibly happen 

40 



could rouse him from his apathy. 
But he had forgotten one possibility. 
Seu came to him in Chong Yin’s, 
where Yin’s eldest son Fu now 
moved in his father’s place, and 
said, “Rack wasn’t taken. He’s 
here.” 

Cudyk sat with his teacup raised 
halfway between the table and his 
lips. After a long moment, he saw 
that his hand was trembling vio- 
lently. He set the cup down. He 
said, “Where?” 

“The Little Bear. Half the town 
has gone there already. Do you 
want to go?” 

Cudyk stood up slowly. “Yes,” he 
said, “I suppose so.” But he felt 
the tension that pulled his body to- 
gether, he tautened muscles in back 
and shoulders and arms. 

As they reached the corner of 
6eskoslovensko and Washington, 
they saw scattered groups of men 
moving ahead of them, all hurrying, 
some frankly running. The crowd 
was thick around the doorway of 
The Little Bear when they reached 
it, and they had difficulty forcing a 
passage. Men moved aside for Seu 
willingly enough, but there was little 
space to move. 

Inside, it was worse. The stair- 
way was solidly packed; it was ob- 
viously impossible to get through. 

“There is- a back stair,” Seu 
said. He worked his way toward the 
rear of the room, Cudyk following, 
until he caught sight of the bar- 
tender. The press was not so thick 
here, and he was able to reach the 
man and lead him into a comer 
away from the others. “Can you get 
us up the back way?” 

The Russian nodded, scowled, 
and put his finger to his lips. Fol- 

DAMON KNIGHT 




lowing him, they went through the 
swinging doors at the back of the 
room, through the dark kitchen and 
up the narrow service stairs at the 
rear. The bartender unlocked the 
door and helped them force it open 
against the pressure of the packed 
bodies inside. 

The long room was heavy with 
the odors of sweat, tobacco smoke 
and stale air. Faces shone greasily 
under the glare of the ceiling lights. 
The only clear space was the table- 
top against the wall to Cudyk’s 
right, where Rack stood. 

Gudyk could see him clearly over 
the heads of those in front of him. 
He stood with legs planted firmly, 
hands at his sides. As always, the 
leather jacket was draped over his 
shoulders like a cloak. 

He was alone. Spider was not 
there, nor Monk, nor Tom De 
Grasse. 

Rack was talking in a low, clear 
voice. Cudyk listened to the end of 
a sentence which conveyed nothing 
to him, and then heard: “After 
that, we got it. They gave it to us.” 
Rack’s hands clenched once, and 
then opened again. 

“They intercepted us three min- 
utes after we came out of overdrive 
in the orbit of New Earth. Twelve 
fighting ships, the whole fleet. We 
were in a line, just closing in after 
we broke G on the way down — the 
Thermopolae, the Tours, the Wa- 
terloo, the Chateau Thierry, the 
Dunkirk, the Leningrad, the Acre, 
the Valley Forge, the Hiroshima, 
the San Francisco, the Seoul, and 
the flagship last, the Armageddon . 

“We didn’t know they were there 
— they were out of our detector 
range. They had us like sitting 
ducks. The first thing we knew 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



about it was when a teletype report 
from the leading ship, the Thermo- 
polae, broke off in the middle of a 
word. Five seconds later the same 
thing happened to a report coming 
in from the next ship. Three sec- 
onds more, and the Waterloo was 
gone. 

“I gave the order to reverse ac- 
celeration and scatter. But the field 
— whatever it was — came after us. 
It would have taken us at least two 
minutes to build up the overdrive 
potential again, and we all knew we 
wouldn’t make it. They were get- 
ting us one ship every six or eight 
seconds. 

“The men were looking to me for 
orders. I didn’t have any to give 
them. Suddenly De Grasse turned 
around and looked at Monk and 
Spider, and they all nodded. They 
jumped me. I don’t know what 
happened. I struck my head against 
the deck when I went down, or one 
of them hit me with a gun-butt.” 

His fists clenched and opened 
once more. “When I came to, I was 
strapped into a one-man lifeboat, 
on overdrive, doing ten C’s. They 
must have emptied the ship’s ac- 
cumulators into that lifeboat, 
charged it up to C potential and 
got me off just before the field hit 
them. 

“I took my bearings, reversed, 
and went back. Eventually I found 
the fleet again. The Galactics had 
matched course and velocity with 
them and they were just beginning 
to tow them off, one ship to one 
with plenty of theirs left over, in 
the general direction of Altair. 

“They hadn’t got into overdrive 
yet. I slipped in — there were a 
hundred of their little scouts nosing 
around, about the same mass as my 

41 




lifeboat — and berthed in the same 
port I’d come out of. I got out and 
walked into the control room. 

“The crew was still there, still 
alive. But not men. They were lying 
on the deck, looking at nothing. 
Their mouths were open, and they 
were drooling.” 

Rack’s head moved stiffly, and 
his sharp profile turned from one 
side of the crowd to the other. 
“Mindless idiots,” he said. “They 
couldn’t feed themselves, or stand 
up, or sit. But they had saved me. 

“I built up the charge and took 
my time about it. When the Galac- 
tics went into overdrive, I took off 
in another direction. I was a good 
seventy light years away before they 
knew I was gone. 

“I had a ship, an undamaged 
ship. But I had no crew to man her. 
I can astrogate, and when I have 
to, I can man the engines on top 
of that. But I can’t fight her as well. 

“I came here, put the Armaged- 
don into a one-day orbit and came 
down in a lifeboat. I want to go 
back and find out what those slime- 
eaters did to us, and give them a 
taste of the same. 1 want twenty 
men ” 

There was a silence. 

Rack said, in the same even, low 
voice, “Will you fight for the hu- 
man race?” 

Someone called, “What did you 
do with your other crew?” 

Rack said, “I gave them military 
burial, in space.” 

For the first time, the crowd as a 
whole broke its silence. A low mur- 
mur rose. Rack said sharply, “I 
would have given my life for those 
men, as they did for me, gladly. 
But they were already dead. If 
there’s a way to restore a man’s 

42 



mind after that has been done to 
it, only the vermin know how. I 
would rather be buried in space, 
and so would they.” 

A deep voice called, “Are you 
God, Rack?” 

“I’m not God,” he said promptly. 
“Are you a man?” 

There was another murmur, dy- 
ing as a pulsing movement began 
near the back of the room: some- 
one was forcing his way toward 
Rack. In the stillness, another voice 
said thinly, “My Deme trios . my 
Alexander . .” It was Moulios, 
wailing for his two lost sons. 

Red-faced, with a lock of black 
hair hanging over his forehead, the 
painter Vekshin squeezed through 
to the edge of the table on which 
Rack stood. He shouted, “I’m a 
man, all right. What do you call 
yourself, you assassin? You come 
here with blood dripping from your 
jaws like a weasel fresh from a 
poultry yard, and we’re supposed to 
feel sorry for you because they 
wouldn’t let you go on killing! The 
great god Rack! Ptui!” 

Rack did not move. He said 
quietly, “I killed your enemies, 
while you sat at home and drank 
tea” 

“Enemies!” Vekshin roared. 
“You’re the enemy, Rack.” He put 
his big hands on the table-top and 
heaved himself up. 

Rack let him come. He waited 
until the Russian was standing on 
the table; then he stepped forward 
with a motion so smooth it seemed 
casual. There was a flurry of blows, 
none of which landed except two: 
one in Vekshin’s midriff, the other 
on the point of his jaw. Five men 
went down as Vekshin’s body 

DAMON KNIGHT 




hurtled into them. 

Rack stepped back. “I have very 
little patience left,” he said, “but if 
there is anyone else here with a per- 
sonal grudge, let him step up.” 

Two men at the table’s edge 
moved as if to climb up. Rack put 
his hand to the gun at his belt. The 
two men stayed where they were. 

Rack stared out over the crowd. 
He looked suddenly very weary. It 
occurred to Cudyk that he must 
have gone without sleep for a long 
time. 

Rack said: “This is the last call. 
I am not trying to deceive you. I 
promise you nothing, not glory, not 
your lives, not even that you will be 
able to spend your lives usefully. 
But if there is any man here who 
will serve aboard the Armageddon, 
in the last fight for mankind — raise 
your hand!” 

There was a long moment’s si- 
lence. Rack turned abruptly, with 
his hand still on his gun, and said 
to the men in front of Cudyk: 
“Stand back!” 

The silence held for an instant, 
while the men at the table’s end 
moved uncertainly away; then 
sound broke like an avalanche. As 
Rack jumped down, the crowd 
surged toward him, no longer an 
audience but a mob. Cudyk felt the 
pressure at his back, caught a 
glimpse of Rack’s face, then heard 
the deafening report of the gun as 
he went hurtling forward into the 
melee. 

The gun did not fire again. 
Cudyk was squeezed tightly in the 
center of the struggling mass. He 
saw Seu, a few feet away. The 
mayor’s mouth was open; he was 
shouting something, but the words 
were lost. 



Suddenly Rack came into view 
again, charging straight toward 
Cudyk, hurling bodies to either 
side. The lower half of his face 
was a smear of blood ; his cap 
and jacket were gone, his shirt 
tom half away. 

Cudyk was half-aware of the 
constriction in his throat, the 
pounding of blood at his temples. 
He wrenched one arm free and, as 
Rack came near, struck him full in 
the face. 

He had one more glimpse of 
Rack’s white features, the pale eyes 
staring at him with a curiously de- 
tached expression: the eyes of a 
Caesar or a Christ, reproachful and 
sad. Then the crowd surged once 
more, the door to the back stairway 
slammed open, and Rack was gone. 

Cudyk found himself running 
through the doorway with half a 
dozen others. He caught sight of 
Rack leaping down the stairs, just 
short of the landing where the nar- 
row stairway doubled back on it- 
self. 

With a regretful sigh, feeling no 
surprise at what he was about to do, 
Cudyk put both hands on the rail- 
ing and swung himself over into 
vacancy. Then there was an instant 
of wild, soaring flight, Rack’s fore- 
shortened body drifting beneath 
him, and the shock. 

Dazed and numb, Cudyk felt the 
universe moving under him like a 
gigantic pendulum. He saw faces 
appear and vanish, felt someone 
push him aside, heard voices faintly. 

After a long time his head 
cleared, and there was silence. He 
was lying at the foot of the stairs, 
one arm flung over the first step. 
Rack was not there; no one was 

43 



THE EARTH QUARTER 




there but himself. 

He moved cautiously and was re- 
warded by an astonishing number 
and variety of pains. But apparent- 
ly he had broken no bones. He felt 
weak and hollow; he was afraid he 
might vomit. He hoisted his torso 
up slowly, sat on the lowest step and 
then put his head between his trem- 
bling knees. 

He heard a foot scuff on the con- 
crete floor, and looked up. It was 
Seu. 

The Chinese looked at him 
anxiously. “You’re all right?” 

“Yes. I think so. I have felt bet- 
ter in my life.” 

“Do you want to get up? Did 
you jump or fall?” 

Cudyk leaned forward, trying the 
strength of his thighs to raise him, 
and Seu put a hand under his arm 
to help. “I jumped,” Cudyk said. 
“What happened, afterward?” 

“The mob came down, me in the 
middle, and I couldn’t stop to see 
if you were all right. They took 
Rack with them. He was uncon- 
scious then ; he may have been 
dead.” 

“And?” 

“They tore him apart,” said Seu. 

They moved toward the exit from 
the kitchen, Seu holding Cudyk’ s 
arm firmly. 

“I don’t know if you felt this,” 
the mayor said stiffly, “but the way 
it seemed to me was that Rack sud- 
denly represented all of it — not only 
the bombings, but the Quarter, the 
Galaxy, Earth — everything we 

hated. It was a feeling of release, a 
kind of ecstasy. Watch out for the 
sifl.” 

“Scapegoat,” Cudyk said, indis- 
tinctly. 

“Yes • i . Zydh Oran saw it, you 

44 



know. He was there when the mob 
came out. He saw it all. This fin- 
ishes the Quarter, Laszlo. After this 
there won’t be any more reprieves.” 
Cudyk glanced down at Seu’s 
plump fingers. There was a thin 
film of blood on the skin, and a 
dark line of it around each finger- 
nail. 



C UDYK stood at the top of the 
gentle rise opposite the Wash- 
ington Avenue bridge, and looked 
down at the Quarter. It was just 
after sunset, and the ranked street 
lights cast a lonesome gleam. The 
streets were empty. There was no 
one left in the Quarter except one 
man in the powerhouse. When the 
time was up, he would pull the 
switches on the master board and 
come out; then the Quarter would 
be dead. 

The Niori edict had come on the 
Wednesday morning after Rack’s 
death. They had been given four 
days to pack their belongings, ar- 
range for assignment of cargo 
space, and wind up their several 
affairs. Cudyk’s stock was small and 
his personal belongings few; he had 
been ready two days ago. 

The evening breeze, freshening, 
pressed Cudyk’s trousers against his 
calves and stirred the hair at the 
back of his head. Looking into the 
east, he saw a few pallid stars in 
the sky. 

Several hundred people had al- 
ready been collected by the air- 
cars which served the spaceport. 
Cudyk, Seu, Exarkos and a few 
others, by unspoken assent, had 
taken places at the rear of the 
crowd, to be the last to go. 

He glanced at Seu. The little 

DAMON KNIGHT 




man was standing with his hands 
in his pockets, shoulders slumped, 
staring dully at the Quarter. He 
looked up after a moment, smiled 
unhappily, and shrugged. 

“It’s absurd to feel homesick for 
it, isn’t it?” he said. “It was a 
ghetto; we had no roots there. It 
was cramped, and it stank, and we 
fought among ourselves more 
viciously than we ever fought on 
Earth. But twenty years . 

“We could pretend that we had 
roots, at least,” Cudyk answered. 
“We don’t belong anywhere. Per- 
haps we’ll be happier, in the long 
run, once we face that and accept 
it.” 

“I doubt it” 

“So do I.” 

To Cudyk’s right, Father Exarkos 
was sitting on his suitcase, hands 
relaxed on his thighs. Cudyk said, 
“If I were a believer, Astereos, I 
think it would do me a great deal of 
good to confess to you and be ab- 
solved.” 

The priest’s dry, friendly voice 
said, “Why, have you sinned so ter- 
ribly, Laszlo?” 

“I killed a man,” said Cudyk, 
“but that’s not what I mean. I 
jumped over a stairway railing and 
stopped Rack. If it hadn’t been for 
me, he might have got away. There 
would have been nothing wrong 
with that. He couldn’t have done 
any more harm, one man by him- 
self. The Guards would have cap- 
tured him sooner or later, anyhow. 
And if he had gotten away, we 
wouldn’t have given the Niori the 
one more straw they needed. In 
that sense, it is my fault that we 
were expelled.” 

“No, Laszlo,” said Seu. 

Exarkos said, “You have nothing 

THE EARTH QUARTER 



for which to reproach yourself, on 
that score. You were only the in- 
strument of history, my friend, and 
a minor instrument at that. And, 
speaking for myself, not for the 
Church, Rack deserved to die.” 

Cudyk thought, at least it was 
quite suitably ironic. Cudyk, the 
man of inaction, hurls himself 
through the air to kill a murderer. 
And the citizens of the Quarter are 
deported, not because one of their 
race murdered a billion billion 
Galactics, but because that same 
killer was killed by them. 

That was one thin mark on the 
credit side. There was one more: 
the tension was gone, for some of 
them at least. Now the worst thing 
that could happen had happened; 
the Damocletian thread had 
snapped. The problems which had 
caused the tension no longer 
existed. 

Earth was two months away. 
Cudyk expected nothing and hoped 
for nothing. But the Niori had 
agreed to set each passenger down 
wherever on the globe he chose to 
go ; each man, at least, could choose 
his own hell. The crews of the cap- 
tured battleships, and the captured 
staff of the base on New Earth, 
were also being sent back. The 
weapon that had been used on 
them had done no permanent dam- 
age; they would simply have to be 
retrained, to learn all over again, as 
if they were reborn. 

Seu was going to North America, 
where he hoped survival for a fat 
cosmopolite would be a little less 
difficult than in Europe or Asia. 
Moskowitz had been born in New 
York, and was going back there. 
Exarkos was going to Istanbul first,

SAINT JULIE AND THE VISGI 

BY ROBERT F. YOUNG 

The woodsman couldn’t spare Julie’s beloved old tree. Down 
it had to come. But the religious tenets of an 
alien race, such as the Visgi, didn’t bother little Julie . 
So she planted another tree in Visgi soil! 



46 





T HE VISGI were conquerors, Visgi proclamation — a proclama- 
but they possessed none of the tion which stated in effect, that the 
characteristics usually associated moment a plafnet came under Visgi 
with conquerors. They were not dominion the inhabitants of said 
cruel ; they were not vindictive ; planet must institute a re-landscap- 
they were not avaricious. They did ing project for the purpose of alter- 
not plunder; they did not pillage; ing all surface features intrinsically 
they did not exploit. The word different from the surface features 
“rape” was not even in their vo- of the planet Visge. For according 
cabulary. They were conquerors be- to the Visgi credo, Visge was the 
cause conquest was their religious Model, the First-To-Be-Created, 
raison d'etre . and it was the Prime Motivator’s 

The Visgi conquered Earth dur- wish that all other planets in the 
ing the last years of the twentieth cosmos be patterned after the 
century, and the occupational ad- Model. That was why He had 
ministrators moved into office im- created the Visgi, and that was 
mediately. The first thing they why Visgi technology went hand in 
did was to issue the traditional hand with Visgi religion. 



47 



Fortunately, Visge was not radi- 
cally different from Earth. It had 
seas and continents. It had rivers 
and plains and lakes and mountains 
and hills. It had a north and south 
polar cap and an International 
Date Line. On one of its northern 
continents there was a peninsula 
that could have passed for Florida. 
Actually there was only one intrin- 
sic difference between Visge and 
Earth. 

On Visge there were no trees. 

J ULIE woke to the metallic song 
of saws and the shouts of men. 
Looking out of her bedroom win- 
dow she saw the movement of 
denim clad bodies in the green 
foliage of the big maple, and saw- 
dust drifting down like yellow 
snow. She dressed quickly and ran 
downstairs. Mother was standing 
on the back porch, her eyes very 
strange. 

In the village below the hill on 
which Julie and her mother lived, 
maples and oaks and elms were dy- 
ing like fine brave soldiers, their 
limbs dropping one by one in the 
summer morning sunlight. But Julie 
had eyes for her soldier only. 

Her swing still hung from one of 
the lower branches. High above her 
head was the special bough whose 
foliaged fingertips brushed her win- 
dow reassuringly on windy nights 
when she could not sleep, and just 
below it was the branch reserved 
for robins when they came north 
each spring. 

“Mother,” she asked, “what are 
they doing to my tree?” 

Mother took her hand. “You 
must be a brave girl, Julie.” 

“But Mother, they hurt my tree!” 



“Hush, dear. They’re only doing 
what they have to do.” 

The first limb fell with a swish- 
ing sound. Sawdust flurried in the 
morning wind. Julie cried out and 
wrenched her hand from Mother’s. 
There was a big man in breeches 
and high-top shoes standing in the 
yard, looking up at the men and 
shouting at them to hurry. Julie 
ran toward him, screaming. “You 
leave my tree alone!” she cried. 
“You leave it alone!” She pounded 
his belt with her small clenched 
hands. 

He grasped her wrists and 
pushed her away. His face was gray 
and there were dark smudges be- 
neath his bleak blue eyes. “Damn 
it!” he shouted over Julie’s head, 
“isn’t this job tough enough as it 
is? Get her out of here. Get her out 
of here!” 

Julie felt Mother’s soft hands on 
her shoulders. “I’m sorry,” Mother 
said. “But she doesn’t mean any 
harm. You see, she doesn’t under- 
stand.” 

“Why doesn’t she?” the big man 
shouted. “She had it in school, 
didn’t she? The Visgi held de- 
forestation classes in every school in 
the world. Kids are supposed to 
hate trees now.” 

“But she doesn’t go to school. 
You see, she’s — She’s not quite — ” 
Mother paused. The big man 
looked at Julie closely. Something 
very odd happened to his eyes. 
They had been like winter, and 
now, suddenly, they were like sum- 
mer — soft and deep and misted. He 
looked back at Mother. “I’m sorry,” 
he said. “I didn’t know.” 

“Of course you didn’t,” Mother 
said. “It’s all right.” 

“I hate to take the tree down. 



48 



ROBERT F. YOUNG 




You know that, don’t you?” 

“I know / 5 Mother said. Her 
hand tightened on Julie’s. “Come, 
Julie, we’ll go back to the house.” 
The big man fumbled in the 
pockets of his breeches. He handed 
Julie a quarter. “Here,” he said. 
“You be a brave girl now, won’t 
you?” 

Julie ignored the quarter. She 
looked up into the man’s eyes. 
“Please don’t hurt my tree,” she 
said. 

The big man stood there helpless- 
ly. “Come, Julie,” Mother said 
again. “We have to get out of the 
way so the men can work.” 

Julie accompanied her reluctant- 
ly. “We’ll go in and have break- 
fast,” Mother said. “We’ll have 
scrambled eggs, just the way you 
like them.” 

“No!” 

“Yes, Julie.” 

Julie cried, but Mother made her 
go in the house and sit at the kitch- 
en table. The swishing sounds and 
the thuds of falling limbs kept com- 
ing through the open window, and 
the singing of saws. Mother scram- 
bled eggs and made toast. She 
poured Julie a glass of milk. Julie 
listened to the saws. There was 
another saw now, a saw that sang in 
a loud rasping voice. Suddenly 
someone shouted “Timber!” and 
right after that there was a heavy 
sickening thud. Julie tried to run to 
the window, but Mother caught her 
in her arms and held her very close. 
“It’s all right, darling,” she said 
over and over. “It’s all right. Don’t 
cry, baby, don’t cry.” 

But Julie cried and cried. 

That night she dreamed of the 
tree. She dreamed of it the way it 

SAINT JULIE AND THE V1SGI 



had been in winter, dark and for- 
lorn, its branches charcoal tracings 
on somber metallic skies. She 
dreamed of it the way it had been 
in spring, with new buds filming 
its branches with pale green mist. 
But most of all she dreamed of it 
the way it had been in summer, a 
green cloud above her head as she 
sat in her swing, a lovely cloud with 
the wind sighing through it, with 
the sky a robin’s egg blue all around 
it. 

A little girl and a cloud of a tree 
adrift on the top of a hill. 

The next day the landscape men 
came. Julie woke to the huffing and 
puffing of a giant crane. Looking 
out her window she saw the big 
claw of the crane sinking into the 
stump of the tree and the steel 
cables tightening. There was a thick 
ripping sound when the stump 
pulled loose, and a shower of dark 
earth. The stump came out of the 
ground like a grisly tooth, its roots 
trailing wildly below it. The crane 
swung the stump around and 
dropped it into a waiting dump 
truck and the truck thundered 
down the hill into the valley. 
Another dump truck backed up to 
the dark deep wound where the 
stump had been and disgorged its 
load of reddish Visge soil; then a 
bulldozer began to chug-chug, 
creeping back and forth across the 
yard like a mechanized triceratops. 

Julie dressed slowly. Mother was 
in the kitchen, sitting at the white 
table looking at her hands. She 
looked up when Julie came in. 
“Good morning, darling,” she said. 
“Did you have a nice sleep?” 

“Will they plant a new tree?” 
Julie asked. 



49 




“No, Julie. They’ll plant grass. 
The kind of grass that grows on 
Visge.” 

“But why, Mother?” 

Mother looked down at her 
hands again. “Because they must, 
dear. Because that’s the way they 
are. Shall I scramble you some 
eggs?” 

“I’m not hungry,” Julie said. 

The bulldozer labored all morn- 
ing. By noon the ground where the 
tree had stood was level, and after 
they ate their lunch the landscape 
men got long rakes from their pick- 
up truck and began raking the 
Visge soil. (Visge soil was restricted 
to hilltops where the danger of 
erosion was greatest.) They raked 
the soil till it was broken up into 
fine particles, then they planted 
Visge grass. They planted it the 
way the Visgi had instructed them, 
thickly so that the long roots would 
become entangled and lock the soil 
against the onslaughts of the rain 
and the wind. It was late afternoon 
when they finished, and they got in- 
to their truck and drove down the 
hill to the village. 

That evening Julie sat on the 
porch steps, staring at the naked 
yard. She concentrated on the spot 
where the tree had stood, memoriz- 
ing it with her eyes. She sat there 
long after the sun had set, watch- 
ing the shadows creep up the hill. 
Mother sat behind her on the 
rocker. Around them in the coalesc- 
ing darkness crickets began their 
chant, and from the marshes at the 
end of the valley came the disso- 
nant singing of frogs. Fireflies began 
to flicker in the dark blurs of bushes 
on the borders of the yard. 

Finally Mother said: “It’s time 
for bed, Julie.” 

50 



“All right, Mother.” 

“Would you like a glass of milk?” 
“No, Mother.” 

“You must be very hungry. You 
hardly touched your supper.” 

“No, Mother. I’m not hungry at 
all ” 

The house was very still, and 
damp with night. Julie lay very 
quietly in her bed, pretending sleep. 
She lay there for a long while, till 
Mother’s breathing became even 
and deep, then she got up and tip- 
toed down the stairs. She opened 
the door carefully and walked soft- 
ly across the porch and down the 
steps. The moon was full and the 
naked yard was silver now. 

Julie didn’t think they could have 
noticed the little tree. She was sure 
that she was the only one in the 
world who knew about it. She got 
her diminutive shovel out of her 
sand pail and went around to the 
side of the house. The tree was still 
there, growing very close to the 
foundation, hugging the concrete 
blocks as though it was afraid. It 
was as big around as Julie’s little 
finger, it was a foot high, and it 
had one leaf. 

She dug it up tenderly, then she 
carried it around the house to the 
place where the big tree had been. 
She planted it carefully, patting 
the soil around its tendril of a 
trunk till it stood up straight in the 
moonlight. “There,” she said when 
she had finished, “the yard looks 
much better now.” 

She tiptoed back to bed. 



T HE LOCAL administrator 
trudged up the hill early the 
next morning. Julie was already up 

ROBERT F. YOUNG 




and she was watering the new tree 
with her red sprinkling can. Mother 
was still in bed. 

The Visgi didn’t trust Terrans. 
They didn’t trust anybody. It was 
each Visgi administrator’s responsi- 
bility to see to it that the inhabit- 
ants of the zone which he governed 
lived up to the letter of the Visgi 
edict, and the zones were small 
enough so that each administrator 
could personally check the work of 
his Terran landscape crew. 

The local administrator was typi- 
cal of his race, both mentally and 
physically. His face was flat and he 
had flat gray eyes. His ears grew 
flatly against the sides of his head. 
He was wearing a flat-topped kepi. 
When he saw the little tree he 
stopped dead on his flat feet. 

He hated trees. He hated any 
plant that did not grow on Visge. 
It was a religious conditioned re- 
flex. In the beginning the Prime 
Motivator had created Visge; then 
He had created the rest of the cos- 
mos. He had intended that all of 
the planets should be like Visge, 
but during the hectic days of the 
Creation He had become careless 
and made them any old way. So as 
soon as the cosmos was completed 
He had created the Visgi and given 
them the Word to go forth in ships 
and set the other planets right. 

Certainly if He had intended 
planets to have trees He would 
have put some on Visge too. 

The local administrator strode 
indignantly across the newly seeded 
soil and towered ominously over 
the little tree. He reached down 
with one large self-righteous hand. 
His fingertips had almost touched 
the thin trunk before the Thought 
— as it was later designated in Visgi 

SAINT JULIE AND THE VISGI 



scripture — struck him. Then some- 
thing else struck him. Julie’s sprin- 
kling can bounced off his shoulder, 
showering his face with water. 
“You leave my tree alone!” she 
said. 

The local administrator hardly 
noticed the can or the water. He 
was down on his hands and knees, 
his face close to the ground, his 
eyes scrutinizing the soil. But his 
eyes only confirmed what his mind 
had known in the first place: a 
quantity of Visge soil was always 
distributed whenever sizeable trees 
were removed from hilltops. 

He got slowly to his feet. His liat 
gray eyes had acquired a third di- 
mension. He looked down at the 
little girl. “You planted this?” he 
asked, pointing to the tree. 

“Yes,” Julie said, “and don’t you 
dare cut it down!” 

The local administrator stared at 
her, the Thought sinking its fingers 
deeper and deeper into his Visgi 
brain. Abruptly he turned and be- 
gan to run down the hill to the vil- 
lage. Julie had never seen a Visgi 
run before and she watched, en- 
thralled. She was still watching 
when Mother called from the up- 
stairs window and asked what was 
the matter. The local administrator 
had reached the bottom of the hill 
by then and was hurrying up the 
village street toward his headquar- 
ters. 

It was not a matter for a mere 
local administrator to handle, so 
the first thing he did when he 
reached his headquarters was to 
call the Visgi resident governor and 
explain the nature of his insight. 
The governor regarded him skepti- 
cally at first, his precipitate cliff of 

51 




a face dark and foreboding on the 
telescreen; but finally he agreed to 
investigate the matter immediately 
and directed the local administrator 
to have everything in readiness for 
his official appearance. 

The local administrator notified 
the officer of the guard without de- 
lay, and the officer of the guard as- 
sembled a ceremonial detail in dress 
scarlet. Shortly before noon the de- 
tail marched militarily up the hill, 
the local administrator in the lead. 
He was beginning to have misgiv- 
ings by then, and the governor’s 
awesome face haunted him. Per- 
haps he had acted too hastily. Per- 
haps he had divined a religious 
motif where none existed at all. 
Certainly the Prime Motivator’s 
ways were complex, but did not 
their very complexity make them 
all the more difficult of interpreta- 
tion? And did local administrators 
have any business trying to inter- 
pret them at all? 

By the time they reached the top 
of the hill the local administrator 
was perspiring, but not from the 
exertion of the climb. However, he 
surveyed the scene with outward 
calm while the officer of the guard 
aligned the detail in two parallel 
scarlet rows along the edge of the 
seeded area. 

Julie and her mother were stand- 
ing together on the porch steps. 
The little tree was standing all 
alone in the middle of the yard, its 
single leaf fluttering valiantly in the 
summer wind. Suddenly a shadow 
drifted across the hill, and the local 
administrator looked up. The swal- 
low-shape of the governor’s ship 
showed brightly in the blue sky and 
even as he watched it began to de- 
scend. “Quickly l” he shouted to the 

52 



officer of the guard. “Obtain the 
Terran child and stand her by the 
tree so that the governor can see 
them both together!” 

At first Julie was frightened, and 
Mother seemed frightened too. But 
after the officer of the guard had 
explained what was about to take 
place, Mother said it would be all 
right for Julie to go with him. 
Mother’s eyes were very bright, 
Julie thought; they had not been 
that bright for a long time — not 
since Father had gone away in the 
silver ship and never returned. Julie 
liked to see Mother’s eyes that way 
and she skipped happily along be- 
side the big officer of the guard. 

She stood by the little tree while 
the big swallow-ship came down, 
and she watched while the Visgi 
with the awesome cliff of a face de- 
scended the spiral landing stairs. 
His entourage followed. There were 
so many of them that Julie thought 
they would never stop emerging 
from the ship, but finally they did. 
They formed in a group behind the 
governor, talking and waving their 
arms. They seemed terribly excited 
over something. 

The governor talked for awhile 
with the local administrator. Then 
he bent down and scooped up a 
handful of reddish soil and exam- 
ined it minutely. He looked over at 
Julie and the tree, his face still like 
a cliff, but a cliff with the first rays 
of the morning sun just beginning 
to illuminate it. He walked across 
the yard to the tree. The local ad- 
ministrator walked beside him and 
the governor’s entourage followed. 

“See how sturdy it is,” the local 
administrator said. “How green its 
foliage.” 



ROBERT F. YOUNG 




“As green as the hills of Visge,” 
the governor said. 

“Only on Visge soil could a tree 
grow like that.” 

“Truly the ways of the Prime 
Motivator are inscrutable!” 

For Visge soil was Visge soil, no 
matter where it happened to be, 
and whatever grew on Visge soil 
automatically became native to 
Visge. The Prime Motivator’s ways 
were devious, but they were beyond 
questioning by mortals, even Visgi 
mortals. If He had chosen such an 
indirect method of bringing trees to 
the Model, there was undoubtedly 
a sound motivation behind his 



reasoning. Henceforth, trees would 
be planted on Visge and be per- 
mitted to grow throughout the re- 
mainder of the cosmos. 

The governor’s entourage could 
contain themselves no longer. They 
edged around the governor and the 
local administrator, jostling each 
other in their eagerness to see the 
first Visge maple. But the governor 
did not reprimand them. The gov- 
ernor was staring at Julie. His face 
was no longer awesome — it was 
filled with awe instead. For it had 
occurred to him that he was stand- 
ing face to face with the first Visge 
saint. • • • 



WORTH CITING 

SHOULD the world go to war again, no matter how terrible the con- 
flict may be, man’s cultural and scientific heritage will be protected from 
destruction by a universally recognized symbol — a blue and white shield 
painted on buildings and objects as a sort of “hands off” sign to enemy 
bombers. 

All the great nations of the world, fifty of them, including Soviet Russia 
and her satellite countries, recently signed a solemn pledge to respect this 
symbol. There are to be no exceptions made on the grounds of military 
necessity or any other practical reason. And the Russian spokesman stands 
on record that no possible consideration would, under any circumstances, 
allow their armed forces to damage the cultural property of any other 
power that has signed the treaty. 

It is a great step for so many of the world’s leading powers to come to 
an agreement about what should be done to protect man’s heritage, thereby 
achieving a step forward in relieving some of the barbarity of war. 

Our citation this month goes to France and Italy, and particularly 
UNESCO for their initiative, and for the results gained at the recent 
meeting at the Hague.

There is always a breed immune to mass hypnosis, and to them 
falls the duty of rebellion .. .The story, by a 
Brigham Young University senior, that won the second award of 
$500 in IF’s College Science Fiction Contest 



A SWIRL of dust licked at the 
grass sandals of the men 
standing on the hill. There were 
eight men, and they stood looking 
west over the burned, gutted land 
that lay barren before them — bar- 
ren except for a series of huge 
mounds that lay in a depression far 
out from the hills on the rocky 
plains. 

“Do you still think we can make 
it?” asked a stocky man with a livid 
scar that ran from his upper lip to 
his forehead. “I for one would 
rather live alone and meagerly than 
not live at all.” 

The speaker received a stern 
glance from a tall hawk-nosed man 
wearing a finely-worked leather 



belt, apparently a symbol of leader- 
ship. 

“We have already agreed, re- 
member, Franz? We have to suc- 
ceed or disappear off the face of 
the Earth. You may turn back if 
you wish. We are going on.” 

Franz scowled, rubbed his scar 
and contemplated the mounds in 
the distance. “You forget I have 
lived there. You have not. Well, 
maybe to be a slave is not so bad 
after all. Or to die.” 

“If we die we will not go alone,” 
said Sten, the leader. He turned to 
the others. “Let’s go. It will be dark 
soon.” 

The men moved single-file down 
through the hills without speaking. 



55 




As it grew dark they could feel 
the heat radiate from the sand. 
They felt the heat press against 
them and silently praised Sten’s 
wisdom in waiting for the cold time 
of year before making the attempt. 
They wore a tunic of coarse-woven 
cloth that hung loose from their 
shoulders, and even that single gar- 
ment was too warm here. They 
moved in silence, Sten in the lead, 
followed by his brother, Johnathon, 
a smaller man with wide shoulders 
and a quick smile. 

A gibbous moon was showing 
over the mountains when they 
stopped. Solemnly they gathered in 
a circle. 

“We will separate now,” Sten 
spoke softly. “Franz and Johnathon 
and Karl and I will enter from the 
south. Bradley, you and the others 
will find the way in from the north. 
You can find the place. If we’re 
not back at our last camp by morn- 
ing of the third day, go on without 
us. You have the map where the 
valley lies?” 

The leader of the other group 
nodded. 

“Then hurry. Until three days, 
then. Remember, the only hope lies 
in us. Some of us have to make it!” 
The men separated with only a 
wave of farewell and the two 
groups moved in opposite directions 
across the hot sands. 

Clouds covered the moon and it 
grew darker as the four men ap- 
proached the edge of the mounds. 
An ominous sense of foreboding fell 
over them. It seemed they could 
feel the vibration of the city that lay 
beneath them. Beneath them lay 
life — stilted, twisted, enslaved life, 
but life nevertheless. 

“Are you sure they don’t post a 



guard?” Johnathon asked. 

“Against what, the Root-Dig- 
gers?” Franz spat "contemptuously. 
“No, they are secure. They need 
fear nothing.” 

It was another hour before they 
found the tunnel and entered in 
single file. Groping their way 
through the darkness, they finally 
felt a solid wall rise in front of 
them. Franz made his way to the 
left, feeling his way along the wall 
until he found a large box in a 
niche in the rock. 

“It’s here! It’s still here after all.” 

“Good,” Sten said. “All right, 
everybody up against the wall and 
push.” 

Karl, the biggest of the men, 
laughed as he eased his bulk against 
the obstruction. “It would be real 
sport,” he said, “to move this wall 
and find one of their Steel-heads 
waiting for us.” 

Franz snickered. “It wouldn’t be 
sport long, my friend. They’re 
trained from birth to be trigger- 
happy and there’s nothing any- 
one in Panamia fears more than the 
outside, or anything connected with 
it. And we’re outsiders.” 

The wall suddenly gave before 
them and they moved into a half- 
darkened room. Carefully, in a sort 
of frozen silence, they moved the 
wall back into place. The box had 
contained city clothes; and now the 
men worked swiftly in the semi- 
darkness. When they were ready 
Franz walked up and down mak- 
ing final adjustments in each of 
their uniforms. As he finished, Sten 
laid his hand on his shoulder. 
“Franz, you’ll take over now. You 
know what everything is like here. 
We’re placing ourselves in your 
hands.” 



56 



JACK A. NELSON 




Franz shrugged his shoulders al- 
most as if he were disinterested in 
the drama in which they were tak- 
ing part. His eyes searched the faces 
of the men. 

“So you want women, eh? You 
want to preserve our race — the 
glorious animal, Man. Ha! I ask 
you to ponder for a moment, before 
it is too late, whether this race is 
worth preserving. Men have been 
furthering the race for milleniums 
and what has it come to? Consider 
if the earth wouldn’t prosper better 
without Man.” 

The men shifted uneasily. “For- 
get all that, Franz,” Sten snapped. 
“You know there must be an an- 
swer somewhere. This is our only 
chance. Everything can’t be dead.” 

Franz looked away. “As you wish. 
If you’re determined to go through 
with it, then let’s start. But first, 
remember that you’re Steel-heads, 
bred and raised with no other 
thought than to carry out the will 
of Him — The Leader. His will is 
your will. You do not think, you 
only act according to orders. Don’t 
look intelligent, that is suspect. Just 
stare straight ahead and do what I 
tell you — or what any other officer 
might tell you, for that matter. Re- 
member, don’t question anything! 
Just follow orders.” 

He laid his hand on the door 
that led to the city, hesitated for a 
brief instant, then swung it open. 
As the men entered, walking stiffly 
with eyes coldly searching for the 
unknown, they were hit by a high- 
pitched whine that filled the cor- 
ridor and seemed to pierce deep 
within them. The three men cov- 
ered their ears with their hands and 
cringed. But Franz stood straight 
and moved his head around to 



catch the noise from all angles. His 
mouth opened and closed slowly as 
if he were trying to pull the shrill 
noise deep within him. Finally he* 
shook his head, as a dog shakes off 
water, and gathered command of 
himself. 

“It is The Leader,” he said in a 
loud voice to overcome the whine. 
“Soon you will not notice it. It is 
everywhere.” 

Sten removed his hands from his 
ears and felt the noise creep over 
him. He shuddered, and felt beads 
of sweat form on his forehead as 
the sound seemed to gnaw at his 
consciousness. Soon the others were 
able to bear the noise with their 
ears uncovered, but they felt rest- 
less and uneasy. 

“We’re lucky not to have been 
seen,” said Franz. “Come on.” 

They moved down the corridor 
in military formation, Franz leading 
and the others following dumbly. 
The corridor was small and well- 
lighted. Doors opened into cubicles 
every few feet, and the wall was 
lined with wide view-screens that 
stared out, like probing and sullen 
eyes. The men kept their eyes 
straight ahead, but occasionally 
they flicked a glance sideways at the 
people that were passing them in 
both directions. They halted as they 
reached the main corridor. 

A loud buzzer rose above the 
whine, and people emerged from 
the doors along the walls and 
passed them in silence. Eyes fixed 
on the ground. A few talked as 
they went by, but none noticed the 
soldiers standing at the edge of the 
corridor. 

Three girls, walking in silence, 
paused before the men for a brief 
instant, then passed on. Sten felt his

THE MEN OF BORU 




eyes following the girls hungrily. 
Catching himself, he pulled back to 
attention and nudged his brother 
at his side. “Steel-head, Johnathon, 
remember?” Johnathon again 
looked straight ahead and stifled 
the beginnings of a grin that tugged 
at the corners of his mouth. Franz 
also stared after the girls, but his 
eyes wore an amused expression, 
rather than the longing look of the 
other men. 

Franz spat out a curt order and 
they began to march down the cor- 
ridor again, the crowd making 
room for them automatically. 
Everywhere posters glared at them 
from the walls. Some pictured a 
huge eye that stared out with the 
words, “The Leader is watching.” 
Others showed the smiling faces of 
a throng of people. Underneath, in 
scarlet lettering was emblazoned: 
“Panamia and The Leader March 
On— PROGRESS.” 

For an hour they marched 
through the city, ignored by the 
people and apparently unaware 
of all that was happening around 
them. They passed thousands of 
men and women, a milling mass, 
each immersed in a grim stupor. 
Where the main corridors inter- 
sected they entered great assembly 
places where huge view-screens 
were set up. They were always 
turned on. 

A shrill emotional voice blared 
out a constant stream of propa- 
ganda. “People of Panamia, unite, 
work! The Root-Diggers must be 
repulsed! For the glory of The 
Leader, for the glory of Panamia, 
we must accomplish our utmost. 
We must give our all!” 

“For The Leader! For Panam- 
ia!” the people shouted, rising mo- 

58 



mentarily from their dull world, 
their eyes glazed with emotion. 
Banners beneath the screens an- 
nounced in large crimson letters: 
Service to The Leader is glory to 
yourself and Panamia. 

The soldiers stood watching 
tight-lipped. Franz’s nostrils quiv- 
ered as the tumult of the demon- 
stration thundered about them. His 
face took on an eager look as he 
watched the people shouting in ex- 
altation, a curt movement of Sten’s 
hand brought him back to the task 
at hand. He gave a short barked or- 
der and the group moved on. 

They had just reached an inter- 
section and were standing awaiting 
directions from Franz when a shout 
rang out. “Stop, Provost. You! 
What are you doing here?” A short, 
ruddy-faced officer in thick-lensed 
glasses strode up the corridor to- 
ward them, scowling. Sten cautious- 
ly moved his head around to face 
the danger. 

“Sten, attention! He’ll know,” 
Franz hissed from the side of his 
mouth. 

Sten snapped back to attention, 
staring straight ahead. 

The squat officer confronted 
Franz. “Who assigned you to this 
block?” 

Franz saluted. “Security sent us 
to check on a disturbance near 
here.” 

The officer’s eyes narrowed. “Dis- 
turbance? I have heard of no dis- 
turbance.” 

“That is of no matter. We were 
sent.” 

The squat officer stared hard at 
Franz. “Hmm, I see. And what is 
your rank number, Provost?” 

Franz told him a number that he 
remembered. 



JACK A. NELSON 




The officer looked them over 
searchingly, his lower lip protrud- 
ing in obvious contempt. “Very 
well, carry on. But Provost, 1*11 re- 
member you!” He stood watching 
as they marched away, rubbing his 
chin thoughtfully with the palm of 
his hand. 

Sten felt a sickening void in his 
stomach as they marched past the 
officer. Surely the man suspected. 
Would it all end right here, before 
they even had a chance to get 
started? He felt the reassuring pres- 
sure of the knife inside his belt, the 
one weapon that Franz had ad- 
vised, and resolved that, if it should 
be necessary, their lives would be 
sold dearly. 

After a while they turned into a 
series of side passage-ways and 
Franz stopped before the door to 
one of the cubicles. The corridor 
was empty, and they were out of 
range of the view-screens. Johna- 
thon relaxed against the wall and 
sighed. “What a sight. I never ex- 
pected it to be as bad as this. Did 
you notice the look in most of their 
eyes? It’s a dull, glazed almost dead 
look. They’re nothing more than 
beaten animals.” 

“Easy,” Franz cautioned, “wait 
till we get inside.” 

He pressed the button on the 
door. A woman’s voice came 
through the door panel. “What do 
you want?” 

“Open. In the name of The 
Leader. It is a Provost.” 

Slowly the door swung open and 
the men saw a small brunette stand- 
ing before them. “What do you 
want?” she repeated in the same 
monotone. 

“Interrogation!” Franz pushed 
his way inside. The others followed. 



The woman stood against the 
wall cowering from the soldiers. 
Franz searched around the apart- 
ment carefully, then confronted the 
woman. 

“Do you not know me?” 

The woman stared into his eyes. 
Finally she said, “No, no, I don’t 
know you.” 

“Do you not remember Jean- 
nine? The girl you worked with? 
Remember the plans? The plans to 
leave here and go outside to build 
a new life?” 

Her chin quivered as she tried 
to speak. “Yes, now I remember. 
You are Franz, Jeannine’s lover. 
That was before The Leader found 
out and . and sent Jeannine 
away. You disappeared, I thought 
you had been sent away, too. It is 
hard to remember. You know we 
are ordered to forget the past. 
What . what do you want of 
me?” 

Franz motioned to the men with 
him, “We are from the outside.” 

The woman recoiled with a gasp 
and backed even closer to the wall. 
“Root-Diggers!” 

Sten stepped forward. “No, we’re 
not Root-Diggers. We’re the men 
of Boru. We’ve come to lead you 
and others like you to freedom.” 

“Barbarians!” the woman 
snarled. “You’re planning to over- 
throw Panamia!” She lunged wildly 
at the switch that would have 
turned on her view-screen. Sten 
caught her and pushed her back 
against the wall. The woman 
screamed once before Sten slapped 
her, then she sobbed into her hands. 

“Shut up!” Sten commanded. 
“We mean no harm. We have come 
only to lead out to freedom those 
who wish to go.” 




“You are against The Leader.” 
Franz laughed. “Let’s say we 
hope to outwit him.” 

The woman drew back. “That is 
impossible, he cannot be outwitted. 
The Leader is all.” 

Johnathon looked up from the 
corner where he was examining the 
view-screen. “That may be, but we 
intend to have a try at it.” 

Karl, who had been leaning 
against the door, suddenly sat down 
on a hard bench against the wall. 
“Damn,” he complained, “this 
whining noise gives me a head- 
ache.” 

The woman allowed herself a 
moment of curiosity. “What whin- 
ing noise? There is no noise.” 
“They are conditioned to it,” 
Franz spoke to Sten. “It’s a part 
of their lives. We never hear the 
pounding of our hearts.” 

The woman sat down on the 
bench and buried her face in her 
hands. 

“Tell me,” Sten said, “Has she 
no husband?” 

“Husband? In Panamia there is 



no such thing. Everyone lives alone. 
When they reach maturity, they 
are summoned to a meeting with 
The Leader, and mated with him 
or one of his representatives. That 
is all. The child is raised by The 
Leader’s nurses. It is all a very im- 
personal business. They never speak 
of it.” 

The lights in the apartment 
dimmed. Immediately the woman 
rose and walked mechanically to a 
bunk set in the wall, curled up, and 
was asleep almost before the men 
could notice her. 

“What was that?” 

“Just The Leader’s signal that it 
is time for sleep,” Franz said. “Did 
you see how she obeyed?” 

“They live like clockwork,” Sten 
muttered. 

Several hours later the lights 
came on again. The woman rose 
without speaking to the men, who 
had slept on the floor, and sat 
down at the table to eat. 

“Hey, don’t we get invited to 
breakfast?” asked Karl, sitting up 
in the corner.

Johnathon sniffed the air. “From 
the smell of it I don’t think I want 
any.” 

The woman looked up annoyed. 
“When are you going to leave? I 
have to go to my work. It’s impor- 
tant to Panamia.” This last was 
said with a fierce pride. 

“Will she be missed?” Sten asked 
Franz. 

“Yes, but they allow one day 
away for illness. The second day 
they check.” 

“Don’t Worry,” Sten told the 
woman. “We will leave when we 
have what we came for.” 

“And what is that?” 

“Freedom.” 

“But you say freedom is outside. 
Why didn’t you stay?” 

“Because there must be freedom 
for our children — and for their 
children.” 

“You have children?” she looked 
interested. 

“We shall soon.” 

“Yes,” she said scornfully, “free- 
dom for the children of the Root- 
Diggers. But you come to Panamia 

THE MEN OF BORU 



for that freedom!” 

“We told you we’re not Root- 
Diggers,” Johnathon said. “You 
can hardly compare us with that 
tribe of poor devils. But even their 
state is better than living like a slave 
in Panamia.” 

The woman laughed bitterly. “If 
you are not Root-Diggers, why do 
you come to hurt Panamia and The 
Leader? It is because of you people 
that we are warred upon and must 
always sacrifice.” 

Franz rose and faced the woman. 
“Kathryn, you’re wrong,” he said. 
“The Root-Diggers are not warring 
with Panamia. They are only men 
and women like ourselves who have 
been banned from Panamia. The 
Leader had them purged before 
they were forced outside so that 
they are sterile and have only half 
their wits. They have to live like 
animals, eating roots and berries 
and bugs and insects. Those are the 
Root-Diggers your Leader uses to 
frighten you.” 

The woman clenched her fists 
until the knuckles showed white. 




“You lie!” she screamed. “The 
Leader tells the truth.” 

“No, it’s not a lie. We have all 
seen them,” Sten said quietly. 

The men sat in silence while the 
woman wept. 

Karl reached out and ate a bit 
of the woman’s food. “What sort 
of gruel is this stuff, I wonder. It 
needs salt.” 

“Salt,” commented Franz, “is the 
greatest luxury in the city. Because 
of the Root-Diggers, you know. 
There is a grave shortage. The peo- 
ple crave it more than anything 
else and will go to any lengths to 
get an extra ration of it.” 

Sten shook his head. “And they 
blame it on those poor beasts out- 
side.” He rose and began nervously 
pacing the floor. “Franz, we have 
to move quickly. The others will 
leave if we don’t meet them on time. 
Do you think she will go with us? 
Will she help us get others?” 

“Who knows about her?” Franz 
shrugged. “I know some others here 
who may want to go. We can see 
them now, but someone has to 
stay here with Kathryn.” 

Sten watched the hungry eyes 
of Karl and Johnathon as they 
looked at the now silent woman, 
sitting dejectedly at the table. 

“I’ll stay,” he said. 

The two men moved reluctantly 
as they followed Franz from the 
room. Sten sat in silence after they 
were gone, watching the woman, 
who was staring sullenly at the table 
top. He felt the pressure of the room 
close in on him, and wished he 
were back in the openness of the 
mountains. With a start he realized 
that he no longer noticed the whine 
unless he listened for it, and that 
the sound somehow created a feel- 

62 



ing of warmth within him. He rose, 
slammed his fist into his open palm, 
and shook the woman vigorously. 

“Kathryn, how would you like 
to leave here? Go to a new land, a 
valley that is still green and fertile? 
There you could look up at the 
sky and live and feel free — and 
raise your children free.” 

Kathryn looked up dumb- 
founded. “I couldn’t leave here. 
What would I do? Don’t you know 
that this is real freedom? Here 
where we have The Leader to take 
care of everything for us” 

“No! This is bondage. Being told 
when to sleep and when to eat and 
what to eat, and slaving for a grain 
of salt.” 

“Do you have salt?” she seemed 
incredulous. 

“Out there, Kathryn, you can 
have as much as you want. Believe 
me, this is no good. Where is the 
purpose of your life? Man wasn’t 
born to be a slave to anyone or any- 
thing, but to build his own life. 
You’re a woman, meant to have 
children, to mother them, and teach 
them, and love them, doesn’t that 
mean anything to you?” 

“I ... I don’t know. I’ve never 
thought about it before.” 

“You must think about it! Would 
you have it all end here? Living 
always at the command of an un- 
known voice?” 

The woman’s eyes searched the 
room, as if seeking some sign of 
reassurance. “But . I’ve never 
thought of any other kind of life. 
I’m happy here!” 

“Happy? Being a living robot? 
You’ve never touched real happi- 
ness. Think, Kathryn. Think hard 
about this. It’s the most important 
thing in the world.” 

JACK A. NELSON 




She turned from the man and 
looked at the wall. 



I T WAS several hours before 
Franz and the others returned. 
Kathryn was in her bunk, her eyes 
shut, an instrument clamped to her 
temples. 

Franz breathed a sigh of relief as 
the door closed behind them. 
“Whew, that’s not good for the 
nerves! Every time we turned a 
corner we ran into that officer we 
met yesterday. I think he’s watch- 
ing us.” 

“Sten,” Johnathon said excitedly, 
“you should have gone with us. 
Most of the people wouldn’t even 
listen, but there was a girl who was 
interested. I’ve never seen anything 
like her, Sten. She’s so soft and 
small and . .” 

Karl interrupted enthusiastically. 
“And she has a friend that’s coming 
with her! Her name’s Stella — I 
touched her and she’s smoother 
than anything I ever felt. I ... I 
think she may go with us.” 

Sten and Franz stood soberly 
watching the child-like joy of the 
two men, a new joy, something un- 
quenchable that burned deep with- 
in them. 

“These people are mindless 
fools,” Franz snorted. “Most of 
them didn’t even remember me. 
The Leader’s forgetting treatments 
are pretty strong stuff, I guess. ‘The 
Past is Forgotten, the Future is the 
Glory of The Leader’, that’s the 
motto.” 

“No wonder the poor souls seem 
mindless,” said Sten soberly. “But 
what about the girls they’re so hap- 
py about?” he motioned to the 
table where Karl and Johnathon 

THE MEN OF BORU 



were glibly comparing notes on 
the girls they had met. 

“They didn’t remember me 
either, but they seemed to be able 
to think independently. They also 
thought of some others who might 
be interested. What will we do if 
we get too many?” 

“We’ll take anyone who wants 
to go. At least, as many as we can. 
The important thing is that we get 
enough to start again outside.” He 
pointed to the nook where Kathryn 
was still curled in the foetal posi- 
tion. 

“What’s Kathryn doing, Franz? 
She’s been like that for an hour.” 

Franz’s eyes held a look of pity. 
“It is the one recreation that The 
Leader allows them. It’s hard to 
explain exactly what it is, but you 
are carried away by it. It’s some- 
thing like a drug, yet it’s mechani- 
cal. Something like music or sweet 
voices washes over you and you 
dream. For a time, you actually 
live.” 

Sten shuddered. “The only real- 
ity is dreams then, eh? Tell me, are 
these people actually capable of 
love?” 

“It’s completely foreign to them, 
but they are human beings, and I 
suppose love is innate in us all. I 
found it here once, you know.” Sten 
looked away as Franz stared hard 
at the floor. 

The tension was broken by a 
knock at the door, and three wom- 
en followed by a single man en- 
tered. When they had exchanged 
greetings and been seated, Sten 
stood up in the middle of the room. 
Kathryn, who had wakened from 
her dreaming, sat watching wide- 
eyed. 

“Franz has told you why we are 

63 




here. We believe the human race is 
doomed to slavery and annihilation 
unless some of us break away. My 
father left us a treasure of books 
that his father before him had 
salvaged from the holocaust. They 
tell of a way of life before the land 
was ravaged. It was a better way, 
believe me. We men have lived in 
Boru, a small valley back in the 
hills. But now we’re leaving there. 
Long ago our father told us of a 
green valley to the east, high in the 
mountains where things grow as 
they did in the time before all this. 
We have a map; and we’re going 
there to find freedom. We need you 
to keep this freedom.” 

A hush of silence held the room 
for a moment, and was broken 
finally by the man who had come 
with the three girls. “Will The 
Leader be there?” 

Sten stared hard at the man. 
“You will be your own leader. Can’t 
you see that? Your Leader is only 
an illusion! There is no leader but 
yourself, and perhaps the God in 
my father’s books.” 

The man sat a moment, then 
shook his head. “Not without The 
Leader — I couldn’t face it.” 

“You have your choice,” Franz 
said coldly. 

The man rose and grasped the 
arm of the tall woman that had 
come in with him. “Then we have 
no business with you,” he said as 
he led the woman to the door. The 
woman looked back hopelessly as 
she followed the man out. 

“And you?” Sten asked the re- 
maining women. 

The blonde girl smiled and took 
hold of Johnathon’s arm. “I will 

go” 

They all turned to the shy-look- 
64 



ing girl who sat next to Karl. She 
looked hard at the man next to her 
before speaking. “Yes, me too,” she 
almost whispered. 

“Good. That’s two. Kathryn, 
what about you?” 

She looked Sten squarely in the 
eye. “I’ve decided to stay. Why 
should I leave this good life to be 
devoured by beasts or Root-Diggers 
on the outside?” 

Sten sighed. “Then we need 
more. And quickly. We must leave 
by tomorrow night at the latest.” 
After the women had been es- 
corted to their cubicles, Franz led 
the men through the corridors to- 
ward the center of the city. In each 
great square they passed squads of 
soldiers dressed like themselves, 
staring straight ahead in the same 
unconscious way. 

When they paused in the middle 
of a hall to plan their strategy, Karl 
turned to Franz. “Something’s 
bothering me, Franz. Just where do 
they put their dead? We haven’t 
passed anything like a graveyard.” 
Franz laughed. “Death is rare 
in Panamia, my friend. When a 
person grows old or very ill, he is 
summoned by The Leader. He 
never comes back. I never knew 
anyone to come back. As far as any 
one knows they’re still at the head- 
quarters of The Leader.” 

A huge cavern-like room loomed 
ahead where all the main passage- 
ways intersected. In the middle of 
the square sat a great round build- 
ing, forbidding, yet beautiful. Doors 
opened on all sides leading into the 
great domed structure. 

“And this is where The Leader 
dwells. Nice, eh?” Franz said. 

The men stood looking at the 
huge dome until it seemed to them 

JACK A. NELSON 




that they were being noticed, then 
they passed on through the square. 
At the far edge, Franz suddenly 
stiffened. “Walk fast. Hurry,” he 
muttered. Sten quickened his pace 
to keep up with the others, then 
felt a chill run over him as he saw 
the officer with the thick glasses 
watching them from a window in 
the dome. 

“I wonder what would happen,” 
Karl muttered, “if a guy could get 
into that dome for a few minutes to 
play with the machinery?” 

“Perhaps it could be done,” 
Franz replied. “But it would be 
your last act on earth. Nevertheless, 
it would be interesting to see what 
would happen to the people if the 
machinery stopped.” 

Sten noted the thoughtful ex- 
pression on Franz’s face. The man’s 
eyes searched the corridor, where, 
by listening carefully, he could hear 
the high whine of The Leader. 

Kathryn was home from her job 
when they returned. 

“Well, how is your enlistment 
program coming?” she asked when 
they entered. 

Sten looked at her and felt his 
stomach pull tight within him. 

“Not so well,” Franz replied. 
“Those I knew when I was here 
have forgotten what they believed 
then or are gone. It’s too dangerous 
to speak to many new ones.” 

“There aren’t many fools in 
Panamia,” she retorted. 

Johnathon grasped Sten’s arm 
entreatingly. “Sten, come with us, 
we’ll see the girls. They have friends 
who may be interested. We only 
have a few more hours, let’s not 
waste them.” 

“No, you go on. I’ll stay here for 
a while.” 



“As for me,” Franz said, rising, 
“I’ll go with Karl and Johnathon. 
I have to check on something.” 

Kathryn sat at the table watching 
Sten as , the others left. He looked 
away from her eyes. “You’ll be 
alone again soon. Tell me, don’t you 
ever get lonesome all by yourself all 
the time?” 

“I have The Leader. He is al- 
ways near.” 

“You have nothing then. Don’t 
you realize it is nothing?” He rose 
and walked to the nook where her 
recreation machine sat on a shelf. 
Grasping it with both hands, he 
wrenched it from the wall and let 
it fall to the floor, smashed. She 
stared at it dumbly. 

“See! There is your Leader — a 
smashed machine!” Sten shouted. 
He moved to her side and leaned 
close to her. “Kathryn, you’re a 
woman. You’re not stone! Don’t 
you feel anything at all?” Her neck 
turned slowly red as he pulled her 
toward him. 

“No, I feel nothing,” she said 
woodenly. “Is this supposed to be 
something special, the touch of a 
man?” 

“It can be.” He put his face into 
her hair. Slowly he pulled her head 
back and looked into her eyes, then 
he kissed her, hard. 

She fought free of him and be- 
gan pacing back and forth. “I don’t 
know. I don’t know. Perhaps you 
are right, but I don’t know if I 
can do it.” 

“Here, what’s this?” Johnathon 
entered smiling. “Has there been a 
change of heart? Good. Then we 
can leave. Franz here tells me he 
found the lady he went looking for 
too.” 

Kathryn looked again at the 

65 



THE MEN OF BORU 




dream machine lying on the floor, 
then at Sten. She seemed to gather 
up strength for a brief moment. 
“I’ll go,” she whispered. 

“I’m glad,” Sten said. “We can 
leave right away then. What about 
your girl, Franz?” 

“She is waiting for me,” Franz 
smiled. “I made sure of that. But 
it is a long way. Give me an hour. 
Better yet, I’ll meet you at the tun- 
nel in an hour and a half.” 

Franz laid his hand on Sten’s 
shoulder and spoke in a low voice. 
“If I’m not there in an hour and a 
half, go on. I’ll catch you outside.” 
He squeezed Sten’s shoulder. “Be 
careful, my friend. And good luck.” 
Sten looked at the door for an 
instant after Franz had gone. “We 
must be careful. We don’t want to 
be noticed.” 

“Soon there will be nobody to 
notice us,” Johnathon said exu- 
berantly. “We can yell and run and 
laugh, and there will be nobody to 
care, not even The Leader.” 

A silence fell over the room as he 
mentioned the name. Sten broke it 
to issue an order for everyone to 
gather his things. Kathryn gazed 
longingly round the room as the 
others moved out. She bit her lip 
with the effort it took to keep from 
pulling back as Sten led her from 
the room. 

They passed through the corri- 
dors without incident, stopping 
when they reached the intersection 
that led to the tunnel. They stood 
there at the edge of the intersection, 
anxiously awaiting Franz. 

Sten stiffened as he saw the offi- 
cer that had stopped them before 
approaching down the corridor, fol- 
lowed by a soldier. The men 
snapped to attention and stood as if 

66 



guarding the women. 

The officer swaggered up to 
Sten. “Here, what are you doing 
with these women?” He studied 
Sten’s face. “Don’t I know you? Ah 
yes, you were with that scar-faced 
provost that’s been snooping around 
lately. Your actions are most out 
of the ordinary. I think we had 
better go along to The Leader’s 
headquarters and check on this.” 
“We have other orders,” Sten 
stated flatly. 

“What! You dare disobey!” 

“We have orders. But look, here 
comes our officer now. Ask him.” 
As the officer turned, Sten lunged 
forward and struck him a blow on 
the neck, knocking him to the floor. 
Instantly he fell on top of him. 
There was a fierce struggle as the 
officer tried to reach inside his 
tunic for his weapon. Suddenly the 
officer gasped. When his body was 
still, Sten slowly withdrew his knife 
from the man’s chest. The soldier 
stood staring stupidly at his fallen 
officer until Karl clubbed him from 
behind. 

“We’ve got to get out of here,” 
panted Sten. 

“Franz! What about Franz?” 

“I don’t know. He should be here 
by now. But he said he’d catch us.” 
As they fled down the corridor, 
the view-screens along the way were 
blaring the usual message of the 
glory of The Leader. Abruptly the 
voice died away, the whine faded 
to a diminishing hum, and there 
was an increasing stillness. The 
whine stopped and the corridors 
were silent. The women, terror 
stricken by the stillness, screamed 
and fell writhing on the floor. 
Shouts filled the corridors as pan- 
icked throngs left without the sym- 

JACK A. NELSON 




bols of The Leader ran from their 
cubicles in terror. 

“What is it? 5 ’ Karl shouted above 
the din, shaking his head to clear it. 

“The whining noise. It stopped.” 
Sten gasped. “Franz! It’s Franz! He 
must have gotten in and wrecked 
the dynamos.” He pulled Kathryn 
to her feet and shook her to stop 
her sobbing. 

Then, as suddenly as it had 
stopped, the whine began again, 
slowly gaining momentum until it 
reached its former pitch. With this, 
the sobs of the women subsided and 
calmness slowly crept back through 
the corridors. 

“It’s started again,” Karl began 
running toward the tunnel. “They 
must have spare dynamos. Poor 
Franz, all for nothing.” 

Again the view-speakers were 
blaring, this time warning the peo- 
ple that a saboteur had made an 
attempt to destroy The Leader. 

The women were gasping for 
breath when they reached the door 
to the tunnel. Sten plunged through 
the door, hurrying the others in 
after him, and then threw his 
weight against the wall. With 
three men pushing against it, the 
wall gave way and they entered the 
tunnel. 

It was night outside. They walked 
slowly, consoling the women, who 
were sobbing again at the loss of 
the shrill god they had known for 
so long. The heat that radiated 
from the sand was suffocating. 

“We have to hurry on,” Sten told 
the women. “We can’t be caught in 
this sand tomorrow. There are 
foothills ahead where we can rest.” 

It was morning when the men, 
carrying the women, entered a 
rocky canyon and wearily slumped 

THE MEN OF BORU 



down in the shade of a cliff. The 
women barely moved, sleeping the 
sleep of the exhausted. 

“Lord, I’m tired,” Karl groaned. 

Sten laughed. “At least we ac- 
complished our mission. Except . 
for Franz.” 

The men sat silent. 

“Maybe Franz fulfilled his pur- 
pose, too,” Karl said. “That dyna- 
mo was the woman he had waiting 
for him. He probably got a lot of 
satisfaction out of knowing that for 
one minute, at least, Panamia was 
without The Leader.” 

The other men didn’t answer. 
They were asleep. 

They woke as the sun was going 
down. Sten climbed the cliffs to 
look out over the desert in search of 
the other party. He returned de- 
jected. 

“They’re half a day overdue 
now,” he said. “Our food’s low so 
we’ll have to go on and hope they 
catch up later. Bradley has an- 
other map.” 

He noticed the women sitting 
against the base of the cliff, terrified. 

“What’s wrong?” 

Kathryn looked around them at 
the barren ground and at the clear 
sky stretching away to the horizon. 
“What’s wrong? Look at this. I feel 
like I’m floating in air. There’s 
nothing over us!” 

The men laughed. 

“Don’t laugh,” Marta wailed. 
“It’s a horrible feeling. This empti- 
ness is killing me. Sing, shout, do 
something! But let’s not have such 
silence!” 

Stella, the shy girl with the 
mouse-colored hair, began crying 
again. Karl gently pulled her head 
over on his shoulder.

T HEY LEFT at dark, winding 
up through the canyon and 
back into the hills where the scrub 
trees began. All night they traveled, 
tearing their flesh on the jagged 
limbs and rocks in the darkness. 
Only, the occasional muffled sob of 
the women broke the stillness. 

In the morning they rested in a 
small valley where a trickle of water 
coarsed through its head. They 
rested under a pinion tree, the 
women receiving some solace from 
the flimsy natural roof over their 
heads. 

Sten slept three hours, then rose 
without waking the others and 
scouted ahead. He consulted his 
map and climbed a tall hill to 
search for the mountain range they 
were seeking. 

When he returned, Johnathon 
and Marta were gone. 

“He said he had to go,” Karl 
explained. “Marta couldn’t take 
this, and he wouldn’t go on without 
her. He said he knew he couldn’t 
make you understand. And asked 
you to take care of your father’s 
books. He hoped that someday he 
could join us in the valley.” 

“Can he stand living there?” 
Sten asked glumly. 

“Franz said once that it had been 
done before. I guess they don’t 
bother you much if you obey.” 

Sten squatted on his heels and 
stared out over the desert where 
Johnathon and Marta had disap- 
peared, sending them a silent God- 
speed. 

When they started out that after- 
noon, Stella was still sobbing. Karl 
tried to console her, but at every 
new turn they took, there was fresh 
terror in her eyes. Kathryn walked 
along with her, helping her over the 

68 



rough places and trying to cheer 
her, but she couldn’t conceal her 
own terror as she stared ahead at 
the vast distances. 

They rested at sundown. While 
the men were bringing water, Stella 
rose and started back down the hill- 
side. Kathryn was thrown aside 
when she tried to stop her, and soon 
the girl was running madly down 
the hill, shrieking and sobbing wild- 

!y- 

Karl dropped his pack and ran 
after her, begging her to stop. But 
she ran on, heedless of obstacles. 
There was a sudden sharp wail of 
terror as she ran blindly off the edge 
of a cliff. 

Sten met Karl carrying her 
crushed body back up the hill. Karl 
hugged the dead girl close to him 
and did not look at the other man. 

That night, for the first time, 
they built a fire. Karl sat grief- 
stricken through most of the night 
staring into the flames. Kathryn sat 
leaning against Sten during the eve- 
ning, fascinated by the flickering of 
the fire — the first she had ever seen. 

At dawn Sten awoke and nudged 
Kathryn. A grey squirrel was scold- 
ing them from a limb above. He 
laughed at Kathryn’s wide-eyed 
surprise at the antics of the little 
animal. 

They rose without waking Karl, 
who was sleeping heavily in front 
of the bumed-out fire, and walked 
down to the edge of the creek. A 
chipmunk scampered away in front 
of them and a blue- jay screeched 
from a near-by tree. A meadow-lark 
trilled its fine notes somewhere 
down the creek. They sat here at 
the edge of the creek-bank and 
leaned back on the grass. 

Kathryn stared to the west where 

JACK A. NELSON 




a line of white clouds were playing 
along the horizon. “You know some- 
thing, Sten? I don’t notice the si- 
lence so much anymore, and the 
distance doesn’t worry me now, 
either. I guess maybe there’s some- 
thing here after all.” 

Sten pulled her close and smelled 
the good smell of green grass be- 
neath them. 

The next afternoon they had 
nearly reached the top of the pass. 
They were just below timber-line. 
Finally, looking to the east, they 
saw a great empty space, with a tall 
mountain range rising jagged on 
the other side. 

“That’s it,” Sten exulted. “Fifty 
miles wide, and in the top of the 
mountains.” 

“I’m glad,” Karl said. “But 
you’re on your own now, Sten. I’m 
going back.” 

“Back? To Panamia?” 

“Yes. There’s nothing for me 
here. Perhaps back there I can find 
something. Maybe I can take up 
where Franz left off. I don’t know. 
There must be others who are not 
afraid of life.” 

Silently Sten offered his hand. 



Karl squeezed it hard and looked 
into his eyes. “Good luck to you in 
your valley. I know where it is now, 
maybe some day I can return. And 
perhaps Bradley and the others will 
make it yet. Until another day then 
. .” he turned abruptly, and started 
back down the mountain. 

Sten and Kathryn, hand in hand, 
watched him disappear through the 
trees. When they could no longer 
see him, they lifted their eyes to the 
hidden valley. They saw, even from 
this distance, the lakes that lay scat- 
tered through it, and the winding 
lines of cottonwoods that grew 
along the rivers, and the plains 
where the green and grey of the 
sagebrush blended. Sten breathed 
deeply of the crisp air and let his 
breath escape in a low whistle. 

“It was worth it, wasn’t it? It’s 
ours. And we won’t always be alone, 
Kathryn. Others will come. Man 
is not dead. It may take a while, 
but others will come.” 

The woman slipped her arm 
around the man’s waist and they 
stood for a time looking out over 
the valley. Then they started the 
long descent. • • •

DOUBLE TAKE 



The Chicago Time Capsule was indeed an elaborate produc- 
tion. The greatest of American acting, writing and electronics 
went into its story of Man, 1960, for future historians. And, 
centuries later, it was dutifully recovered. Only . 



BY WILSON PARKS GRIFFITH 



W HEN the Travelers from Out- 
er Space dug into the pile of 
moldering rock, they found the 
metal capsule their senses had told 
them was there. Battered and cor- 
roded though it was, the shadow 
vibrations showed that it had once 
been smooth and shiny. As smooth, 
shiny and impervious to wear as 
Twentieth Century Earth tech- 
nology could make it. 

At the time the Mayor of Chi- 
cago had ceremoniously tossed a 
handful of lake sand into the hole, 
had his picture taken smiling 

70 



against the skyline, and had moved 
away to let the workmen fill the 
hole with cement and place the 
marker, the Time Capsule had 
been bright with the hopes of civi- 
lization sending its proud present 
into the uncertain future. 

Time passed . 

The tiny radio transmitter in the 
capsule began throwing out its 
wide signal at the exact instant 
planned for it many centuries be- 
fore. No one heard. Eventually, 
the tiny powerful batteries gave out. 
The signal died. 




Time passed . 

When the Travelers from Outer 
Space took the capsule back to 
their ship and opened it, they found 
the contents in perfect order. Even 
the reel of magnetic tape had not 
succumbed to the centuries. 

In due course, the Travelers 
examined the tape, divined its 
purpose, and constructed a ma- 
chine that would play back the 
recording. 

Out of a million evolutionary 
possibilities in a Universe of plan- 
ets, the chances of two intelligent 
races being even roughly similar 
are astronomically remote. 

A being develops sense organs for 
no other reason than to make it 
aware of its environment. The sim- 
plest primitive being’s awareness 
of its environment centers around 
food, its means of survival. It de- 
velops organs and appendages that 
will enable it to ferret out, obtain 
and ingest its food. As the food 
differs, so, then, does the eater. 

The Travelers had no ears or 
eyes, as such. They had other or- 
gans for other purposes, but the 
net result was that they “saw” 
and “heard” quite as well — even 
better — than Earthmen. 

Perhaps that explains why the 
Travelers gleaned so much more 
from the tape recording in the 
Twentieth Century capsule than 
its originators had planned or in- 
tended. 

Not just any radio show could be 
placed in the Time Capsule. What 
picture of contemporary 1960 man- 
kind would the men of the future 
derive from a soap opera? A news 
analysis? Or top comedy show? 



Certainly not a flattering one, and 
so, reasoned the brass in charge of 
the project, not a true one. 

No, the only answer was to pro- 
duce a special documentary pro- 
gram, painting on a broad canvas 
the glories that were the common 
man’s birthright in an enlightened 
democracy. As July 4th was only a 
month away, the idea was a natu- 
ral. The program would be carried 
simultaneously on four networks, 
then placed in the Time Capsule 
so that historians of the future 
would have something solid on 
which to base their conclusions. 

A famous poet-radio writer was 
hired to write the script. Holly- 
wood’s greatest young male star 
donated his services (with much 
attendant publicity) as narrator. A 
self-acknowledge genius who di- 
rected radio shows for a living 
condescended to lend his talents to 
the production. Numerous other 
actors, musicians, technicians and 
assistants were hired . none well- 
known, but all quite competent. 

July 4th, the big day, arrived. 
The cast went into rehearsal early 
in the morning. By the second com- 
plete run-through, just before the 
break for lunch, the show was 
hanging together nicely. After four 
hours of polishing in the afternoon, 
it was ready to go on the air. Every- 
one’s nerves were raw, but the show 
sounded great. 

Naturally, when a room full of 
creative people have been rubbing 
against one another for a full day, 
a lot of emotions are generated. 
The listening audience never knew 
about it, but it took the actors, di- 
rectors, musicians and technicians 
several days to get the session out 
of their systems. During rehearsals, 



71 




the young Hollywood star devel- 
oped a consuming lust for one of 
the minor actresses. One of the 
minor actors developed a consum- 
ing lust for the young Hollywood 
star. Everyone immediately hated 
the director, and he, lofty and all- 
wise, contemptuously hated them 
in return. By eight o’clock that 
night, show time, the splendid docu- 
mentary on the splendid American 
people was not the only thing that 
was at peak pitch. 

It was the only thing, however, 
that the radio audience heard. It 
was magnificent. Future students 
hearing the tape could not but 
conclude that here was the Golden 
Age. Man, at least American man, 
circa 1960, noble, humble and sin- 
cere, was carrying in his bosom 
the seeds of greatness. Difficulties 
still existed, of course, but they 
were not insurmountable. A few 
deluded people seemed to be work- 
ing against the common good, but 
the program left no doubt that 
this would be cleaned up in short 
order. The millenium was at hand! 

When the Travelers from Outer 
Space, who were a team of his- 
torians doing research on the 
history of life throughout the Uni- 
verse, listened to the tape record- 
ing, their “ears” heard none of the 
program as it had been originally 
broadcast. They were no less fas- 
cinated, however, for what they 
heard was the thought patterns of 



the people who had been con- 
nected with the program. These 
thoughts, in the form of electrical 
impulses, were also recorded on 
the magnetic surface of the tape, 
and were the only sounds audible 
to the Travelers. 

What a pity these future his- 
torians didn’t get mankind’s version 
of the life of mankind in 1960, af- 
ter the producers had gone to so 
much trouble to tie it up in a 
package for them. Their conception 
of Earth culture was based on the 
thought impulses they “heard”, 
and their History of Earth was 
written accordingly. The last para- 
graph is worth noting: 

“In the main, it is quite for- 
tunate for life in the Universe that 
these primitive people destroyed 
themselves before they learned how 
to leave their planet. Lustful, mur- 
derous and guilt-ridden, they are 
perhaps the worst examples of in- 
telligent life that we have ever 
discovered. And yet, paradox su- 
preme, they had one quality that 
we ourselves would do well to 
emulate. That quality we can only 
surmise, for nothing on the re- 
cording spoke of it, yet it is obvious, 
for if they hadn’t had this quality, 
there would have been no recording 
left for us at all. 

“ How strange that these tortured 
people should practise an unparal- 
leled example of Life’s highest 
achievement . complete honesty 
with themselves and others.” • • • 



A tool is but an extension of a man’s hand, and a machine is but 
a complex tool. And he that invents a machine augments the 
power of mankind. — Henry Ward Beecher

RACE RIOT 



McCullough was not a native lover , nor was he particularly 
bull-headed. He just felt there was a certain 
difference between right and wrong and nobody was going to 
change his mind. Take that Sunday afternoon . 



BY RALPH WILLIAMS 



T HE RIOT started late Sunday 
afternoon, in the alley back of 
John McCullough’s house. McCul- 
lough was in at the start of it, and 
he was in at the end. 

Sunday is thirty hours long on 
Centaurus II, as are all the other 
days of the week, of course; and in 
summer, at the latitude of Port 
Knakvik, the afternoons are very 
long indeed. John McCullough that 
Sunday had finished hanging the 
windows in the log house he was 
building, and now he was relaxing 
on the back stoop with a bottle of 
local whiskey. The whiskey was dis- 
tilled from a native starchy root, 
and had a peculiar taste, but it was 
alcoholic, and one got used to it. 



In the kitchen McCullough’s wife 
was getting Sunday dinner on the 
new inductor stove, still marvelling 
at its convenience — back on the 
farm they had cooked with wood. 
The two children were playing in 
and out of the house. His neighbors, 
Henry Watts from across the street, 
and Pete Tallant from next door, 
had been helping him with the 
windows, and now they were help- 
ing him with the bottle. They were 
discussing the native question. In 
a way, this was the beginning of the 
riot. 

“It’s not that I got anything 
against them, in their place,” Henry 
Watts said. “Their place just ain’t 
in an Earthman’s town, that’s all. 



74 





They keep crowding in, first thing came down to Knakvik to work on 
you know there’ll be more natives the spaceport the new federal 
than there is Earthmen, then you colonial government was building, 
just watch out. They’re snotty and it was not his nature to worry 
enough already in their sly way, about problems which did not di- 
you let them get the upper hand rectly concern him. Mostly, he liked 
once, mark my word, it won’t be to mind his own business, it was 
safe for a woman to walk down the characteristic of McCullough that 
street.” his friends came to visit him at his 

“Yeah, I guess so,” McCullough house, he did not go to visit them, 
said. He was really not much in- “What the government ought to 
terested. His people were from the do,” Watts said, “it ought to take 
flats upriver from Knakvik, a long- the whole bunch and round them 
settled country where the first up and put them away on a reserva- 
colonists had been brought two tion somewhere. You can’t civilize a 
generations before to form the nu- grayskin, they ain’t even human to 
cleus of an agricultural community, start with, so why try?” 

He had never seen more than half “Nuts,” Pete Tallant said. Where 
a dozen native Centaurans until he Watts was a redneck miner and 



75 



construction worker; and McCul- 
lough a fanner picking up a little 
easy money on a temporary job; 
Tallant was an intellectual, a dark 
restive young Earthman working 
his way around to see how Earth’s 
far colonies looked. Watts’ yapping 
irritated him, but there was no 
point in arguing against that sort 
of brainless conviction, he knew. He 
stared gloomily off at the mountains 
across the river, rising clean and 
snow-capped above the shanties 
and garbage piles of the transient 
workers who had overflowed the 
city to camp on the flats along the 
river; thinking: 

Just over a hundred years ago 
this planet was first discovered by 
men. Less than sixty years ago the 
first colonists were brought here. 
They came to a brand-new planet, 
almost as naked as the day they 
were born — two hundred pounds 
per colonist, including their own 
weight — with a free hand to build 
a new world as they pleased. And 
already the same old pattern, hate 
and distrust and envy, greed and 
oppression. How many men on 
Centaurus II? Perhaps a hundred 
thousand. How many native Cen- 
taurans? Perhaps five million, on a 
planet larger than Earth. But not 
enough room for both — 

“You think I’m prejudiced,” 
Watts said heavily, the need of the 
frontiersman to justify his opinions 
before the cosmopolite rankling in 
his voice. “Well, I ain’t. I just know 
those buggers, that’s all. You green- 
horns come out here from Earth, 
you figure you got an answer to 
everything, just because we don’t 
have the schooling you got, we’re a 
bunch of fools. Ain’t that right, 
John?” 

76 



“Yeah, I guess,” McCullough 
said absently. The next thing to do, 
he thought, now that they had in- 
ductor power from the central sta- 
tion, was to get running water in 
the house. Plastic bubbles and tents 
and shanties and hauling water 
from the pump were well enough 
for bums and single men, but a 
family man might as well be build- 
ing a decent home while he was 
about it. There would always be 
rental value in a good house here 
in town, especially with the new 
spaceport and the government mov- 
ing here; and later, when the kids 
had to go to high school, it would 
be handy. Some day, too, he would 
be retiring, turning the farm over 
to Jimmy, he and Mary would need 
a place to live then. 

“The old ones ain’t so bad,” 
Watts said. “They know their place, 
and they remember what happened 
at Artillery Bluff. But some of these 
young bucks, especially the smart- 
alecky kind the government has 
been sending to school — ” He shook 
his head forebodingly. 

“Nuts,” Tallant said wearily. 
“Let’s talk about something we can 
all be stupid about, huh? Women 
or baseball or something.” 

Watts flushed. “7 know what I’m 
talking about now, and I didn’t get 
it out of books, either, I’ve lived 
with the buggers. You greenhorns 
read all this sob stuff in the high- 
brow magazines back on Earth 
about the noble Centaurans, and 
you figure we’re a bunch of jerks 
because we don’t slobber all over 
them too. Noble Centaurans! Jesus! 
Dirty, sneaking non-humans, that’s 
what.” He lifted the bottle and 
drank deeply, tilting back his head 
and letting his eyes rove. “There,” 

RALPH WILLIAMS 




he said abruptly. “There’s your 
noble Centaurans, look at ’em!” 

A group of natives were coming 
up the alley — in Port Knakvik, na- 
tives did not walk in the street — 
shuffling along with downcast eyes. 
They were a small gray-skinned 
people, roughly humanoid, vivip- 
arous but not mammalian. There 
were five males followed half a 
dozen steps behind by a female 
carrying ap infant on her hip. 

“You see that kish there with her 
fotin?” Watts asked. “Lemme show 
you something, you probably 
wouldn’t believe this if I told you, 
these grayskins are just like animals, 
they got no decency at all.” He 
stood up and waved an arm in a 
beckoning gesture. “Hey, you kish, 
come over here,” he called. 

The female Centauran paused 
uncertainly, looking at him with 
frightened eyes out of a small tri- 
angular noseless face. 

“Yes, you,” Watts barked. “Come 
here!” 

She glanced at the males ahead 
of her, who had also stopped and 
were looking at Watts from the 
comers of their eyes. One mumbled 
something to her. She began to 
shuffle slowly across the yard toward 
Watts, looking at her feet. Watts 
took a steel five^dollar piece from 
his pocket and held it out toward 
her. 

“Here, you kish ” he said, “feed 
baby, viptiv fotin, get money.” 

The native took the coin and 
looked doubtfully at the three men. 
“Viptiv?” she asked in a light high 
voice. 

# “That’s right,” Watts said. “Vip- 
tiv fotin” He grinned at Tallant. 
“Watch this, kid, you want to see 
your noble Centauran do some- 

RACE RIOT 



thing’ll really make you gag.” 

“Oh, for Pete’s sake,” Tallant 
said. “I know these people feed 
their young by regurgitation. So it’s 
disgusting to mammals? So what?” 
He jumped down from the stoop 
and took the Centauran mother’s 
arm and turned her gently around. 
“No viptiv ” he said. “Run along.” 
Watts’ face was almost purple 
now. “What the hell you think 
you’re doing?” he shouted. He 
grasped the female’s other arm. 
“ Viptiv ” he gritted in her face. 
“You took my money, now viptiv !” 
“Let go that woman,” Tallant 
said, “or I’ll push your face in.” 
He turned toward the group of 
males, who still stood stupidly star- 
ing. “Come on over here,” he 
called. “Take your woman and get 
out.” One of them started reluc- 
tantly across the yard. Tallant 
dropped the native woman’s arm 
and stepped past her to face Watts. 
“I told you to let go,” he said. 

Watts thrust his face out. “Make 
me, wise guy.” 

Tallant hit Watts in the face 
with his fist. 

Watts was a big man, and tough. 
He shook his head, wiped his nose, 
looked incredulously at the blood 
on his hand, and let out a roar of 
rage. It was not much of a fight. 
Watts’ first blow dazed Tallant, the 
second knocked him down, and be- 
fore he could get up Watts stepped 
in and kicked him in the head. 

The Centauran woman still stood 
where the men had left her, wide- 
eyed with confusion. She ran awk- 
wardly over to Watts, shoving in 
between him and Tallant’s prostrate 
body, and pushed the five-dollar 
piece at him, chattering excitedly 
in her own tongue. Watts twisted 

77 




the money from her fingers and 
shoved her roughly down on top of 
Tallant. “There, you goddam na- 
tive-lover,” he roared, “get a real 
good whiff of one once, see how you 
like iL ” 

She was still carrying the baby, 
she tried to shield it as she fell, but 
her body twisted and she came 
down heavily on it. The baby 
screamed, a high-pitched, nerve- 
tearing sound. The male who had 
started back to get her pulled a long 
sharp knife from somewhere be- 
neath his rags and broke into a trot, 
his eyes beadily intent on Watts. 

McCullough had started down 
off the porch when Watts put the 
boot to Tallant. He changed his 
intent and ran in behind the native, 
and hit him solidly with his fist in 
the back of the neck. The native 
went sprawling and his knife flew 
out of his hand. 

People were turning to look and 
popping out of tents and shelters 
all around now. 

“Why, that dirty native,” Watts 
bellowed, “he tried to knife me!” 

He stepped over to the Cen- 
tauran and kicked him savagely 
several times. The other four males 
had been watching open-mouthed. 
They turned abruptly and started 
back down the alley the way they 
had come, but there was a small 
knot of men there, watching them. 
The natives paused uncertainly. 
One broke away and ran toward 
the street, between McCullough’s 
house and Tallant’s tent, and the 
others followed. 

Most of the Earthmen had no 
idea what was happening. The 
closer ones could see a couple of 
natives and a man lying on the 
ground, another man with a bloody 

78 



face shouting something about 
knifing, and four natives running. 

“Head ’em off!” someone called. 
“They’ll get away in the street!” 
That was how the riot at Port 
Knakvik started. 



ATTS RAN off after the mob 
chasing the natives, perhaps 
with some idea of explaining, more 
likely not — he was in a half mind- 
less rage of excitement with the 
whiskey and the fighting. McCul- 
lough was left alone with Tallant 
and the two natives. The native 
woman seemed unhurt, she was 
picking herself up and examining 
the infant, which still whimpered. 
Tallant was unconscious. McCul- 
lough picked him up and carried 
him into the house. 

His wife was standing white- 
faced at the door. 

“Get some water,” he said. He 
laid Tallant on a cot and began to 
wipe off his face. There was a 
scalp cut where Watts’ boot had 
clipped him, most of the blood was 
coming from that; but it was high 
and it did not feel like a fracture. 
Presently Tallant groaned and 
shook his head and opened his eyes. 
The pupils did not look bad. 

“How do you feel?” McCullough 
asked. 

“Rough,” Tallant mumbled. 
“Rough. Side . hurts . .” 

McCullough pulled up the shirt 
and looked. There was a swelling 
purplish bruise on the chest. He 
touched it gently and drew a gasp 
of pain. 

“Looks like maybe you got a 
cracked rib,” he said. “Get me some 
tape, will you, Mary?” He took the 
roll of tape and wound it tightly 

RALPH WILLIAMS 





about Tallant’ s chest. 

“That’ll hold till you get to a 
doctor,” he said. 

Tallant drew a light experi- 
mental breath. “Feels better,” he 
said. “What the hell happened any- 
way?” 

McCullough told him. 

“That’s bad,” Tallant said. “That 
fool Watts could touch off a real 
riot, there’s plenty more around 
here with no more brains than he 
has, and just spoiling for trouble. 
Somebody ought to get the mar- 
shal’s office working on it before 
things get out of hand.” He took 
the wet rag he had been holding to 
his head away and examined the 
cut with squeamish fingers. “Have 
to get this stitched up too, I guess, 
before it sets up hard. Look, could 
you back my truck out into the 
street? I don’t feel up to driving, 
but if I get it in the street, it can 
take me in to the dispensary on 
auto, and I can call Administration 
from there.” 

There were very few private ve- 
hicles in Port Knakvik, or indeed 
anywhere on Centaurus II; but 
Tallant, who was an electrician, 
had a company panel which he 
drove to and from the job. Though 
it was chemically powered — the 
new inductor station was the first 
nuclear installation on the planet — 
it had the same cybernetic controls 
as any Earthside vehicle. They 
worked fine on paved roads. On 
Knakvik streets, however — 

“I don’t know,” McCullough said 
dubiously, “You think you can 
make it on auto? Suppose you get 
stalled?” 

Port Knakvik lay on a silty al- 
luvial plain. In the downtown area, 
the streets were stabilized, but back 

RACE RIOT 



along the river where the shan- 
ties of the construction workers 
sprawled, they were simply ruts 
punctuated at frequent intervals 
by chuckholes where churning 
wheels had ripped off the overbur- 
den, exposing the bottomless muck 
beneath. 

“I’d go with you,” McCullough 
said, “except I kind of hate to leave 
Mary and the kids right now — I 
tell you, maybe I could find some- 
body else. You lay down for a min- 
ute, take it easy, I’ll look around.” 

Tallant seemed to have guessed 
right about the riot, there were peo- 
ple running by outside toward a 
commotion at the lower end of the 
street where the native shanties 
clustered. McCullough saw a man 
he knew from the job. “Hey, 
George,” he called, “you got time 
to do a little favor?” He explained 
about Tallant. 

The man had not yet been in any 
fighting, he was simply curious 
about what was going on, and this 
was part of it. “Sure, John,” he 
said. “Be glad to.” 

They helped Tallant into the 
truck. George backed it out into the 
street on manual. “What’s the dis- 
pensary coordinates?” he asked. 

“Three-two-three, oh-one-five, 
local,” Tallant told him. 

George pushed the keys and they 
started off toward town. 

McCullough turned to see what 
he could make out of the excite- 
ment at the other end of the street. 
There were two columns of smoke 
billowing up now, and scattered 
shots. Two men came back up the 
street helping another with his trou- 
ser leg split away and a bloody 
bandage about his thigh. 

“What’s it all about, John?” A 

79 




man called across the street to him. 

“Don’t know. Fighting with the 
natives, I guess. Henry Watts and 
some other fellows chased a couple 
of them down there. Looks like 
they mean to clean the whole bunch 
out.” 

“Dammit, that’s not right,” the 
man across the street said. “The 
natives got a right to live too, they 
had a village here before we came. 
Somebody ought to do something 
about it.” 

“Pete Tallant just went into town 
to tell the marshal.” 

“Yeah, well, I wouldn’t holler 
copper on my neighbors myself, but 
I won’t have anything to do with 
killing those poor natives either. 
They can get along without me.” 
The man went back in his house 
and closed the door. 

McCullough walked a few steps 
out into the street to get a better 
view. The riot was none of his busi- 
ness, and he had no intention of 
getting mixed up in it, but the idea 
of the fighting excited him and 
made him nervous. He could not 
see much, except that there was a 
lot of activity. 

He shook his head helplessly. My 
God, he thought, all this from two 
men with nothing to do on a Sun- 
day afternoon but get half-drunk 
and start arguing . 

S OMEONE screamed — Mary’s 
scream, suddenly choked off! 
McCullough ran back across the 
yard and up the steps, raging at 
himself for having left Mary and 
the children alone in the house. 
There was no one in the front room, 
but through the kitchen door he 
could see a native with his back 

80 



turned, peering out the kitchen 
window. 

McCullough’s gun was hanging 
over the door, on pegs set into the 
logs, a gun made from the first steel 
smelted on Centaurus II. He 
reached down the gun as he stepped 
in the door. 

There were two natives in the 
kitchen ; one with a roughed-up 
look who might have been the one 
Watts had kicked, watching Mary 
as she huddled in a corner by the 
stove with her arms about the two 
children; the other still looking out 
the window. Both spun around to 
face him as McCullough burst into 
the room. 

For a moment they eyed each 
other in silence, the two Centaurans 
and the Earthman. 

“You hurt, Mary?” McCullough 
asked. 

She was frightened almost 
speechless, but she managed a 
squeak and a negative shake of her 
head. 

McCullough took his eyes from 
the natives for a moment and 
studied her searchingly. “You 
sure?” he asked. She nodded. Some 
of the color was coming back in her 
face again now, and she looked all 
right. 

He looked back at the two na- 
tives. He should have them arrested, 
he supposed, but to file a complaint 
meant going to court and losing a 
day’s work. It did not even occur 
to him to hold them for the mob. 

He gestured with the gun muzzle. 
“OK,” he said roughly. “Get out of 
here, now. Get!” 

The natives looked at each other. 
Outside, there was a rattle of shots 
in the alley, and several high- 
pitched screams. The native by the 

RALPH WILLIAMS 




window wet his lips and shook his 
head, and the other turned back to- 
ward McCullough. He had a knife 
in his hand, which he swung menac- 
ingly. 

“No,” he said. “No go outside. 
Kill.” 

It was not clear if he meant the 
verb passively or actively, but with 
the knife not six feet from Mary 
and the children, it did not seem a 
proper time to discuss fine points 
of grammar. McCullough shot him 
in the belly. At that range, the 
charge almost tore the slight native 
in half. 

The other Centauran turned and 
came lunging toward him, and Mc- 
Cullough fired again. The native 
stumbled and fell in a heap in the 
middle of the floor, half across the 
body of the first. 

McCullough stepped over them 
to the back door and glanced out, 
dropping fresh charges in the gun 
as he did so. There were no natives 
in sight but several white men were 
in the alley, looking around, trying 
to decide where the shots had come 
from. Henry Watts was with them. 
He saw McCullough at the door 
and called out to him: “You hear 
those shots? Two of ’em ran back 
up this alley. You see them?” 

“They came in my house,” Mc- 
Cullough said. “I shot both of 
them.” 

“Good, by God,” Watts yelled. 
“That’s two we don’t have to worry 
about.” 

“There’s one more left,” another 
man called from up the alley. “He 
ducked around through Gordon’s 
lot.” 

The men ran off up the alley on 
the new scent, and McCullough 
turned back into the kitchen. Mary 



had collapsed into a chair and was 
sobbing with her head in her arms. 
The two children clung to her, star- 
ing wide-eyed at the bodies of the 
natives. 

McCullough walked over a'nd 
patted her on the back. “It’s OK 
now, Mary,” he said. “It’s OK, 
nothing to worry about now.” His 
wife went on crying, and he stood 
there awkwardly, not quite knowing 
what to do. 

He noticed that the dark purplish 
blood of the natives, almost black, 
was spreading in little rivulets and 
pools over the kitchen floor. The 
floor was of sanded white wood, 
and stained easily. There were some 
folded tarps in the lean-to where 
McCullough kept his tools. He got 
one and rolled the bodies over onto 
it. As he did so, he saw that one 
of them, the second one he had 
shot, was still alive. The shot had 
gone low and mangled the native’s 
upper leg. He stared up at McCul- 
lough with opaque expressionless 
eyes, slowly bleeding to death. 

It was an embarrassing situation. 
McCullough was not any more 
callous than the next man, but he 
found himself wishing his aim had 
been better. He could hardly allow 
the Centauran to lie there and 
bleed to death while he watched, 
but neither did he feel any particu- 
lar responsibility in the matter. The 
native had got what he was asking 
for, and that was that. 

Finally he took the native’s 
leather belt and tightened it around 
the leg for a tourniquet, got another 
tarp and spread it on the cot, and 
laid the native on it. The corpse 
he rolled in the first tarp and 
pushed under the cot. Throughout 
the injured Centauran said nothing, 

81 



RACE RIOT 




either in thanks or protest, although 
the leg must have been painful. 

He had just finished when he 
heard voices in the front yard. 

Henry Watts was there with half 
a dozen other men carrying guns 
and clubs, all looking the worse for 
wear. Two were dragging a Cen- 
tauran corpse by the pants legs. 

Watts mopped at his sweaty, 
blood-stained face with his shirt- 
tail. “You still got those two gray- 
skins in there? ,, he asked. 

McCullough nodded. 

“Fine, we’ll take ’em off your 
hands now.” Watts half-turned to 
the men behind him. “Come on, 
give me a hand to drag ’em out.” 
He started up the steps. 

“Wait a minute,” McCullough 
said. He did not move out of the 
door, he was not quite sure why, a 
moment ago he had been wonder- 
ing what to do with the natives, and 
here was Watts offering to take 
them. It may have been the way 
they were dragging the Centauran, 
face down in the mud, that bothered 
him. “What you going to do with 
them?” he asked. 

“We got a use for ’em,” Watts 
said with relish. “We’re going to 
drag all the bodies up in front of 
Dubois’ place and string ’em up to 
poles there, for a warning. We’ll 
learn those gray skins what to ex- 
pect, they come messing around 
here any more. Come on, toss ’em 
out, we’ll take these two along with 
the rest.” 

“Well, I don’t know,” McCul- 
lough said. “One of these is still 
alive, I didn’t kill him, just crippled 
him.” 

Watts showed his teeth. “That 
won’t be a problem,” he said. 

McCullough shook his head slow- 



ly. He had counted Henry Watts 
as his friend, but he was not so sure 
now that he liked him. “No,” he 
said. “I think we better just leave 
them till the cops come.” 

Watts laughed. “Cops? There 
ain’t going to be any cops coming. 
We’re handling this ourselves. Don’t 
worry about the cops, even if they 
could get an indictment, there ain’t 
a jury in this town would convict 
for killing a native.” 

“I’m not worrying about that,” 
McCullough said stolidly, “but I 
don’t like what you fellows are do- 
ing, I might as well say right now, 
and I’m not going to be a party to 
it. Those natives stay right where 
they are till the law comes and gets 
them.” 

Watts’ grin faded. “John,” he 
said, “we ain’t fooling. I know 
you’re no native-lover, but we’re 
going to clean those devils out once 
for all. If you won’t let us in for 
them, we’ll come in anyway and 
take ’em.” 

McCullough shook his head 
again. “This is my house. Henry, 
you’ve been my friend, but I just 
shot two people for coming in here 
without knocking.” 

Watts looked around at the men 
behind him. Most of them knew 
McCullough. They did not seem 
taken with the idea of breaking into 
his house. Watts swung back to 
McCullough. “John,” he said omi- 
nously, “you’re just making trouble 
for yourself, that’s all.” 

McCullough simply shook his 
head and stood blocking the door- 
way. 

Watts glanced around at the 
other men again. One of them 
shrugged self-consciously and 
turned away, and after a moment 




the others trailed after. 

“All right,” Watts growled. He 
shook his fist under McCullough’s 
nose. “All right, John McCullough, 
I’ll remember this, and I’ll be back. 
Native-lover!” He spat on the step 
and went off after the others. 

McCullough watched them go, 
uneasy under his surface stolidity. 
He liked to be on good terms with 
his neighbors, not enough to give in 
to them on anything he felt strong- 
ly about, but he knew this would 
be held against him, and it worried 
him, more for the sake of Mary and 
the kids than for himself. 

He sensed his wife standing be- 
hind him. 

“What did they want?” she asked. 

He told her. 

“But, John, why? Haven’t we 
had enough trouble today? Do you 
have to get in a fight with your 
neighbors over a stupid native? 
What difference does it make to 
you?” 

McCullough shook his head help- 
lessly. “I don’t know. I just don’t 
like the idea, that’s all.” 

His wife stared wordlessly at him 
for a moment. She went into the 
kitchen and sat down at the table 
and began crying again. The chil- 
dren ran to her and began whim- 
pering also. McCullough prowled 
restlessly about the living-room, 
stooping now and then to peer out 
the windows as men shouted and 
ran by. The native lay silent on the 
cot, unmoving except for his eyes 
which followed McCullough. 

McCullough stopped and studied 
the Centauran resentfully. Goddam 
natives, he thought, all they cause 
is trouble. He bent over and loos- 
ened the strap on the leg until fresh 
blood started to ooze out and then 



tightened it again. The Centauran 
winced a little and closed his eyes 
briefly, but made no other sign. 
Ought to have morphine, McCul- 
lough thought, but would morphine 
work on a Centauran? He didn’t 
know. 

He pulled a chair over to the 
window, where he could watch both 
doors and the cot, and sat down 
with the gun across his knees. The 
riot was apparently still booming 
along. Men trotted by outside now 
and then, singly or in little groups, 
calling to each other. Once several 
went by with another Centauran 
corpse slung hand and foot to a 
pole. There were no women or 
children in sight, those houses with 
blinds had them down, the tent- 
flaps were tightly drawn. There was 
no indication of any attempt by the 
authorities to halt the riot. Possibly 
Tallant had not gotten through, or 
possibly Watts was right, the Ad- 
ministration was keeping hands off. 

After a while Mary came in and 
stood by the chair. Her eyes were 
still red, but she was no longer cry- 
ing. “You want something to eat 
now?” she asked dully. “The roast 
is done.” 

“Yeah, I guess so,” he said. He 
avoided her eyes. 

She fixed a plate and brought it 
to him and sat down to watch him 
eat. 

“You think there’ll be more trou- 
ble?” she asked. “They surely won’t 
bother us again, will they?” 

McCullough chewed thoughtful- 
ly. He thought there would be 
more trouble, but he did not like 
to worry his wife unduly. “Well,” 
he hedged, “that Henry’s kind of a 
bull-headed fellow.” 

“Don’t you be bull-headed too, 

83 



RACE RIOT 




John. I know you have to do what 
you think is right, but please be 
careful.” 

He reached out and took her 
hand in his. “Honey, I’m sorry. I 
know it’s mighty tough on women 
sometimes, but a man just can’t 
give in on some things, that’s all.” 
He looked down, pleased as always 
by the contrast of her small, pale, 
delicate fingers lying in his large 
blunt chocolate-brown hand. The 
contrast seemed especially impor- 
tant today, for reasons he could not 
quite place. 

Was there some special sig- 
nificance in a black man married to 
a white woman, a black man setting 
his will against white men, not as an 
enemy, but as an equal? Back a 
couple of hundred years ago, he 
knew, on Earth — but the thought 
eluded him, he was not a very ar- 
ticulate or subtle thinker and he 
could not pin it down. 

“Don’t you worry, Mary,” he 
said, “it’ll turn out all right.” 



I T WAS almost sundown when 
Watts came back. McCullough 
was checking the tourniquet on the 
native’s leg when he heard a com- 
motion in the street outside. 

“John McCullough,” a voice bel- 
lowed. “Come out!” 

Watts’ voice, McCullough 
thought. He picked up his gun, but 
then he thought he would not feel 
right facing the men outside, who 
were after all his neighbors, with a 
gun in his hands. He looked around. 
The double-bitted axe he had been 
using to trim the logs around his 
window-frames leaned against the 
wall by the door. 

“Get in the bedroom, Mary,” he 



said. “Pull the mattress off the bed 
and lie down behind it with the 
kids.” 

He took the axe and walked out 
the door onto the steps, squinting 
his eyes against the setting sun. The 
street was full of men in front of 
his house, perhaps half a hundred 
or so. Watts and a short stout man 
stood halfway up the path to the 
door. McCullough studied them in 
silence. 

“Well?” he said finally. 

“This man here’s a deputy mar- 
shal, John,” Watts said. “We’ll take 
your prisoner and that body now, 
if you don’t mind.” 

The stout man grinned placat- 
ingly. “That’s right, Mr. McCul- 
lough, I’ve deputized Mr. Watts 
here and several others to help re- 
store order. We’ve rounded up all 
the rioters except that one you’ve 
got in there.” 

“You got a warrant?” McCul- 
lough asked. 

“Well, no, I don’t really think — ” 

“Then get off my property. Go 
on, get!” McCullough came down 
the steps and began to walk slowly 
toward Watts and the marshal. 
“Get out of my yard!” he said. He 
did not raise his voice. 

“You’re bucking the law now, 
John McCullough,” Watts warned. 

“Get out of my yard!” McCul- 
lough said again. He was about 
three steps away from Watts. He 
took another step. 

Watts had been carrying a pistol 
in his hand. His arm started to 
swing up. McCullough let out a 
wordless bark: “ Haugh !” and the 
axe flipped in a short swift arc. He 
stepped over Watts’ body, the axe 
again dangling limply from his 
hand with a few thin threads of 



84 



RALPH WILLIAMS 




blood spattering from it. “Get out 
of my yard!” he said. 

The nearer men backed away 
slowly, not really frightened, but 
uncertain. Single men have faced 
down mobs many times, but more 
have been killed by them. In a 
saner moment, McCullough may 
have known this, but his ductless 
glands were in full control now. He 
did not really care, he rather hoped, 
if he thought at all, that there 
would be a fight. He knew he could 
kill any man who stood against 
him. 

Off to one side, a dozen yards 
away, a man tentatively lifted a 
pistol. McCullough caught the 
movement from the corner of his 
eye and turned and began walking 
toward the man, head a little for- 
ward, bright, slightly unfocussed 
eyes intent in his expressionless face. 
The men between the two moved 
back, leaving a clear path. 

The man with the pistol glanced 
to either side and saw he now 
stood alone, all alone. There is a 
nightmare some men know — the 
implacable deadly-eyed enemy 
coming with the red, wetly gleaming 
steel while you stand all alone with 
the pistol that poufs weakly with 
the bullets dribbling from the muz- 
zle. The man jerked the trigger and 
spun about and ran without wait- 
ing to see where his shot had gone, 
and the charge snapped two feet 
over McCullough’s head. 

McCullough turned again to- 
ward the main body of the mob 
and walked slowly forward, his eyes 
searching the faces around him 
hungrily. “Get out of my yard!” he 
said woodenly. 

The men he faced were not 
cowards, few men on that world 

RACE RIOT 



were, and they had been killing na- 
tives all afternoon, their blood was 
up ; but this was different, this was 
one of their own kind they faced 
now. If they had been able to see 
him as another outcast, as a traitor 
aiding the enemy against them, it 
would have made things easier. In 
spite of what Watts had said, how- 
ever, they knew this was not true. 
McCullough was not a ‘native- 
lover’, he was not upholding the 
Centaurans, what he was uphold- 
ing was the right of a citizen to 
hold his own opinion and keep his 
home as his castle — two rights 
which are extremely important in 
any frontier culture. 

It put them in a very difficult 
moral position, and the physical 
pressure of McCullough’s steady 
advance did not give them much 
time to settle the dilemma. Half a 
dozen men were elbowing their way 
back through the press now, the 
marshal had disappeared, there was 
no one to start things, and they kept 
fading back. McCullough never 
varied his pace, but the distance be- 
tween him and the nearest man in- 
creased steadily. He stopped in the 
street before his house, but the mob 
kept moving under its own momen- 
tum for another fifty yards, and 
some still kept moving. A knot of 
perhaps a dozen stopped at the cor- 
ner and muttered among them- 
selves for a few minutes. One man 
started to raise a gun, and another 
knocked it down. They stood there 
a little longer, and McCullough 
leaned on his axe watching them, 
and then they moved off after the 
others, men dropping off here and 
there as they passed their own 
homes. 

The riot was over. • • •

TURNABOUT 

BY GORDON R. DICKSON 

Eva was the emotional problem which, indirectly, quite possibly 
caused the second problem, a rather baffling field 
force trap, which was a scientific one. Now, sometimes, if you 
solve the second first, you get the first second .

P AUL BARSTOW was saying, 
“And this is the gadget . .” 
His square bright face under its 
close-cropped blond hair was ani- 
mated. He seemed on the verge of 
reaching up to hook a finger in the 
lapel buttonhole of Jack Hendrix’s 
sportcoat to pull the taller man 
down into a position where he 
could shout into his ear. 

“You aren’t listening!” he pro- 
tested now. “Buddy! Jack! Pay 
some attention. Or has that crumb 
teaching job got you to the point 
where money doesn’t mean any- 
thing to you any more?” 

Jack Hendrix’s long, heavy- 
boned face almost blushed. 

“I’m listening,” he said. 

He hadn’t been, of course. This 
was merely one more piece of evi- 
dence to add to the mounting pile 
of proof that he was totally in- 
capable of doing anything right. He 
had been mooning instead over Eva 
Guen, whom he had lost some 
months back. But they had passed 
her in the corridor on their way to 
this small, hidden workroom, and 
something in the way she had 
looked at him had set him spinning 
again. Peculiarly, there had been 
what Jack could have sworn was 
a hurt look in her eyes, in that brief 
moment that they looked at each 
other in passing. Why there should 
be a hurt look in her eyes, Jack 
could not understand. She was the 
one who had left him to come to 
work for Paul — and very sensibly, 
too, he told himself, self-righteously, 
but with the same old twinge of un- 
happiness. 

Eva had been his graduate teach- 
ing assistant at the University where 
he taught physics. She was tall and 
quiet-faced, with startling wide blue 



eyes under soft blonde hair. Quite 
naturally, he had fallen in love with 
her. And it was then the trouble 
started. 

For from the moment Jack was 
forced to admit to himself that he 
was in love, he had to take an un- 
biased look at his chances of doing 
something about it. And that look 
was crushing in its effect. For in the 
process of assembling Jack Hen- 
drix, a somewhat devastating over- 
sight had occurred. Whatever 
minor god had been in the super- 
visory position that day had care- 
fully mixed strength with intelli- 
gence, added just a pinch of genius 
and a sort of ugly-handsome good 
looks, but had totally forgotten at 
the last moment to install a gover- 
nor on Jack’s imagination. The 
result was that Jack was a dreamer. 

And the result of that was that 
he, with three degrees to his name, 
and a couple of honoraries of vari- 
ous sorts lying around, continued to 
vegetate in his teaching job, while 
Paul, in his typical hyper-thyroid 
fashion, was already managing his 
own commercial research labs. Not 
that the comparison was strictly 
fair. Paul had always been more 
promoter than physicist. And Eva 
had gone out of Jack’s life to a 
better job with Paul’s outfit. 

Not that that had anything to do 
with his accepting Paul’s offer of 
a job as consultant on a little prob- 
lem he claimed to have on hand at 
the moment. 

“I’m listening,” said Jack. 

“Praise Allah,” said Paul. “No 
one knows about this but you and 
me. It’s top secret. My top secret.” 

Women, of course, thought Jack 
were naturally secretive. They 
looked at you with unfathomable 



87 




blue eyes and waited for you to 
make the proper move. But how 
could you make the proper move if 
you didn’t know what they were 
thinking? That was why he had 
never gotten around to telling Eva 
how he felt about her. And then 
one day she was gone. He didn’t 
blame her, even if without warn- 
ing it had exploded — 

“ — Exploded?” stammered Jack, 
guiltily. “Well, er — when did that 
happen?” 

“Are you sure you’ve been listen- 
ing?” said Paul, suspiciously. “I 
just told you. A couple of weeks 
back.” He went on to explain the 
circumstances while Jack listened 
with one ear, the image of Eva 
flickering like a candle luring his 
moth-like powers of attention in 
the back of his mind. 

He forced himself to concentrate. 
“But what happened to the man 
you had working on it?” he asked. 
“And what is it, anyway? You still 
haven’t told me that.” 

“You mean Reppleman?” said 
Paul, quickly. “He had a nervous 
breakdown at the time of the ex- 
plosion. Got a complete block on 
the whole thing, and now, they’ve 
got him in a nursing home.” 

A flicker of genuine interest 
stirred for the first time in Jack. 
“Oh?” he said. “How come?” 
“Well, that’s the thing,” said 
Paul. “I’m going to trust you, Jack. 
I’ve got something here that’s 
worth more money than there is 
in the world today; and I’m will- 
ing to give you a slice of it if you 
can work this thing out for me. 
But we’ve got to have secrecy. 

“Right at this moment, you and 
I are the only ones who even know 
this room has been entered since 



the explosion. I rebuilt the genera- 
tor myself from Reppleman’s rec- 
ords. And nobody, but you and I, 
knows we’re back here today. The 
rooms at the back of the building 
here are all storerooms except this 
one.” 

“Generator?” said Jack, for a 
second momentary instant distract- 
ed from the lorelei mental image 
of Eva. 

“A generator,” said Paul, slowly 
and impressively, “of an impene- 
trable, planar field of force. Gome 
over here.” 

The image of Eva went out as 
abruptly as if someone had dropped 
a candle-snuffer over it. Jack 
blinked and followed Paul, as he led 
him up to the equipment in ques- 
tion. 

The small room which housed it 
was right at the bleak northern end 
of the labs and terminated one nar- 
row wing of the building. It was L- 
shaped, with the generator in ques- 
tion tucked away in the narrow 
recess of the foot of the L. The 
length of the long part of the L, 
at right angles to this, was strewn 
with odds and ends of tools and 
equipment piled on two long 
benches fastened to the wall. Along 
the end away from the recess was 
the door that gave entrance to the 
room; and just to the left of this 
as you entered,* at the end of the 
long part of the L, was the room’s 
only window, open at the moment 
to the summer breeze and the 
gravel expanse of the parking lot 
behind the labs. 

His mind for once wholly con- 
centrating on the subject at hand, 
Jack followed Paul into the narrow 
cubbyhole that was the recess and 
listened to the other man’s explana- 

GORDON R. DICKSON

tion of what was before him. It 
was not true, that Jack could not 
focus on a problem. It was merely 
that a thing to hold his attention, 
must first arouse his interest. Once 
it had, he dealt with it with almost 
fantastic effectiveness. 

“You see,” Paul was explaining, 
“it’s a very simple sort of circuit. 
It’s easy enough to produce it. The 
question is to handle it, after you’ve 
produced it. The initial power to 
run it comes from this storage bat- 
tery hookup. That’s all we need.” 
“Then what’s the catch?” asked 
Jack, his nose half-buried in the 
creation’s innards. 

“The trouble is that once it’s 
turned on, there seems to be a sort 
of feedback effect. Well, no, that 
isn’t quite right. What it seems to 
do once it’s turned on is tap some 
other source of power that’s too 
much for it. It overloads and you 
get the explosion.” 

“But while it’s on you have a 
plane of force?” 

“That’s right.” 

“How long?” demanded Jack, his 
long fingers poking in the wiring. 

“You mean from establishment 
of the field to explosion?” replied 
Paul. “About half a minute, as far 
as I can figure from Reppleman’s 
notes and what I could reconstruct 
about what happened the day it 
blew up on him.” 

“You haven’t tried it since you 
rebuilt it?” asked Jack. 

“Do I look crazy?” demanded 
Paul. He put his hand on Jack’s 
arm. “Listen buddy, remember me? 
The boy with the crib notes up his 
sleeve at exams?” 

Half-lost in the machine before 
him as he was, Jack felt a sudden 
little stir of warning. Paul was any- 

TURNABOUT 



thing but stupid ; and when he went 
into his dumb-bunny act, there was 
usually a joker somewhere in the 
deck. But before he could concen- 
trate on the sudden small danger 
signal he ran across something that 
drove it out of his mind. 

“What’s this?” he demanded, 
pouncing on a part of the ap- 
paratus. 

“Oh, that,” said Paul. “Just a 
notion of my own. Obvious answer. 
A timer setup. You set it, say, to 
turn the field on for perhaps a ten- 
thousandth of a second, then turn 
it off again. I’ll let you play with 
it.” 

Jack frowned. 

“Where are the notes?” he asked. 
“I’d like to see just what — Repple- 
man, you said his name was? — had 
written down.” 

Paul grinned and shook his head. 

“Not so fast. First I want an an- 
swer from you on whether you 
think you can tame this baby for 
me or not.” 

“But how can I tell without the 
background?” protested Jack. 

“Won’t cost you a cent to say 
no,” replied Paul. “Don’t look at 
me like that, Jack. Sure, I know 
I’m handing you a pig in a poke. 
But this thing is too big to take 
chances with. Do you want it or 
don’t you?” 

Jack hesitated. He was strongly 
tempted to tell Paul to take a run- 
ning nosedive into the nearest lake, 
and walk out. Then he remembered 
the long life of financial ineptitude 
that had climaxed itself with los- 
ing Eva; and his good resolutions 
to mend his scatterbrained ways. 

“All right,” he said. “I’ll have a 
shot at it, anyhow.” 

“Good boy,” said Paul. He patted 

89 




Jack’s arm, in a way which was 
somehow reminiscent of approving 
a large, shaggy dog. “I’ll be in my 
office. You know where that is. If 
you want anything, just hustle me 
up.” 

He gave Jack’s shoulder a final 
slap and strode out. 



L EFT ALONE, Jack sat down 
on one of the long work- 
benches, filled his pipe and con- 
sidered the problem. The situation 
was peculiar to say the least. Paul’s 
odd insistence on secrecy; and Eva’s 
strange look when she had passed 
him in the corridor. And this story 
about the man who had developed 
the generator. Typically, it did not 
occur to him to doubt the gener- 
ator. Jack was one of those men 
who have entertained the impos- 
sible in their minds so often that 
there is little reality can do to sur- 
prise them. 

So it blew up did it? Jack puffed 
on his pipe and stared at the gener- 
ator. But — hold on a minute — if it 
blew up and when it blew up it 
sent a man named Reppleman to 
a rest home, could it have blown 
up more than once? And if it had 
blown up only once it must have 
been turned on only once, and if 
that was the case, how did Paul 
know that it had produced a plane 
of force? Of course he had probably 
known the theory Reppleman was 
working on. And what was his pur- 
pose in keeping that theory a secret 
from Jack? 

In fact, if the dingus worked, 
how did it work? Jack returned to 
the mass of equipment and wiring 
and began to prowl through it. Aft- 
er a while he stopped and scowled. 

90 



Nine-tenths of the junk in the setup 
was mere window-dressing. The on- 
ly thing about it that could possibly 
have any effect or function was an 
oddly wound coil of ordinary silver 
wire upon a core of some strange- 
looking silvery metal. Jack tapped 
this latter with a fingernail and it 
rang with a faint, light-sounding 
chime. 

By the time this point was 
reached his interest had been cap- 
tured. On a hunch he disconnected 
everything but the coil on its pe- 
culiar core. He disconnected the 
timer, Paul had attached to the 
apparatus, hesitated a second, then 
made contact by crossing the two 
lead-in wires. 

Nothing happened. 

He disconnected the wires and 
sat back to think. 

After a moment, he reached out 
and felt the winding on the coil. It 
was metal-cool — air temperature. 
On second thought, he connected 
the timer and set it to allow a 
warm-up period of fifteen seconds. 
At the end of that time the timer 
should activate the coil for the 
period of a ten-thousandth of a 
second. 

Nothing happened. 

Jack chewed the stem of his pipe. 
Once more he disconnected and felt 
the winding* It was faintly warm — 
but barely so. 

Now let me see, said Jack to him- 
self. We run two sorts of power 
through this thing. One, low power 
and steady. To warm it up? That’s 
what I assumed, but there’s no in- 
dication of it. On the other hand 
this timer is definitely set to give 
a sudden short pulse of relatively 
high current. I tried the high cur- 
rent direct. No result. I tried a short 



GORDON R. DICKSON 




period of low current. What’s next? 

After he had smoked another 
pipeful of tobacco, all that occurred 
to him was to lengthen the warm- 
up period. Let’s do it right, he said 
to himself. Let’s give it a good five 
minutes. 

He turned it on once more and 
set the timer for another ten-thou- 
sandths of a second jolt at the end 
of five minutes of low power. It oc- 
curred to him that the two upright 
metal poles, about two feet in 
length, between which the field was 
supposed to be generated might be 
too close to the coil, and he moved 
them out to the full length of their 
wiring, so that they were now actu- 
ally in the long part of the room. 
He glanced at the timer. Almost 
four minutes yet to go. 

He wandered down the long part 
of the room and stood gazing out 
the window. There was his car, sit- 
ting beside the row of others on the 
gravel of the parking lot. And there, 
farther down the row was Eva’s. 
They were the two oldest cars on 
the lot. You’d almost think we had 
the same taste in automobiles, 
thought Jack, a trifle wistfully. 
Neither of them is worth much — 

Abruptly, without warning, his 
traitorous imagination slipped its 
restraints and began to build a pic- 
ture of Eva coming out on to the 
lot, seeing his old car not very dis- 
tant from hers, and being over- 
whelmed by a flood of memories. 
He pictured her coming out the 
back entrance of the building as he 
stood here watching. She would 
walk across the lot with her 
smooth, lithe stride, toward her 
own old grey, four-door sedan. But 
partway there, her steps would fal- 
ter as she caught sight of his equal- 

TURNABOUT 



ly ancient blue business coupe. She 
would not, of course, say anything, 
but she would stand there; and he, 
seizing the moment, would step 
from this window down onto the 
gravel only a few feet below and 
approach her. 

The sound of his footsteps 
crunching the loose rock would 
warn her of his coming; and she 
would turn to look at him. She 
would neither move nor speak, but 
stand waiting as he came up to her 
and then — 

He was just opening his mouth 
to speak to her in imagination, 
when unexpectedly from behind 
Jack there came the sound of a soft, 
insidious, click. 

F OR A MOMENT he thought 
nothing had happened. The 
parking lot lay unchanged before 
him in the sunlight with its row of 
cars and the sky blue above them 
dotted with distant clouds. And 
then he tried to turn around and 
found he could not, with the slight 
movement of his effort the scene 
before him dissolved into a grey 
field streaked here and there by 
lines of various colors. 

He froze, suddenly, and the scene 
came back to normal. He reached 
out to grab hold of the edge of the 
window to steady himself ; but with 
the first movement he was plunged 
into greyness and his hands caught 
nothing. Once more he steeled him- 
self into immobility, and for a mo- 
ment he hung on the edge of panic. 
What had happened? 

Slowly, he forced his mind back 
into control of his body and its 
emotions. Steady, he told himself, 
steady. Think it through. 

91 




As calmness returned he became 
suddenly and icily aware of two 
things. The first was that every- 
thing within his field of vision ap- 
peared somehow artificially frozen 
into immobility. Just what gave 
him this impression he was not able 
to understand. Part of it was the 
air. A small breeze had been bath- 
ing him as he stood in front of the 
open window. Now, there was noth- 
ing. The atmosphere around him 
was like intangible glass. 

The second thing was the dis- 
covery that he was no longer stand- 
ing with his feet on the floor, but 
lying crosswise athwart the win- 
dow, in mid-air, at about the former 
level of his waist. 

For a moment he was astounded 
that he had not realized this im- 
mediately. And then reasons began 
to appear to him. The first of these 
was the sudden realization that 
gravity appeared to have altered 
respective to his position. He felt 
not at all as if he were lying on his 
side, but as if he had remained 
quite normally upright. And anoth- 
er discovery following immediately 
on the heels of this was the sudden 
perception that while his body 
seemed to have moved, his point 
of view had not. He still looked out 
at the parking lot from the angle 
of vision of a man with both feet 
normally planted on the floor. 

All of these, of course, were 
things that held true only as long as 
he remained perfectly still. The mo- 
ment he attempted to move all his 
senses failed him and he seemed to 
swim in a grey mist. The conclusion 
was a very obvious one. Somehow, 
the generator had worked to pro- 
duce its plane of force. And some- 
how he was caught in it. 



The explosion should come at 
any moment now. 

For one hideous moment he suf- 
fered death in imagination. Then 
reason returned to point out that 
the half minute Paul had men- 
tioned as the time limit had un- 
doubtedly been passed already. 
Still, it was a little while before he 
could completely fight off the ten- 
sion of his body, bracing itself in 
expectation of the rending force 
that could strike at him from be- 
hind. 

In the end it was his imagination 
that saved him. For long habit had 
made it independent of the rest of 
him; and it’s first move, once the 
facts of the matter had been 
grasped and the immediate danger 
of explosion discounted, was to 
draw him a very clear and some- 
what ridiculous mental picture of 
himself as he must appear to any- 
one who might enter the room, 
floating broadside as he was, in thin 
air. It reminded him suddenly that 
positions were no respecters of per- 
sons ; and he remembered almost in 
the same instant of what the White 
Knight had had to say to Alice on 
the subject after resting head- 
downward in a ditch. And so, by 
way of the ludicrous, he scrambled 
back onto the firm ground of his 
everyday sanity.. 

He was caught in a force field. 
Very well. And what could he do 
about it? The obvious answer was 
to turn around, go back to the 
generator and turn it off. And the 
one flaw in this plan was that he 
couldn’t apparently, for some rea- 
son, make the turn. 

On the other hand, he was able 
to make some movements. He ex- 



92 



GORDON R. DICKSON 




perimented, waving first an arm 
and then a leg, cautiously. Barring 
the fact that the slightest motion 
caused the room to appear a night- 
mare of streaks and lines in a grey 
field, there was nothing unusual 
about the effects of these motions. 
The room? He became suddenly 
aware that he seemed to have ro- 
tated around a center-point some- 
where in the region of his belt 
buckle. He was now no longer look- 
ing out the window, but turned at a 
slight angle toward the bench on 
what had been the wall at his right 
hand. Filled with sudden hope, he 
closed his eyes firmly and took what 
should have been a long stride for- 
ward and up. When he opened 
them again he was staring back in- 
to the room, down the long length 
of the L. 

For a long moment he hung, 
carefully motionless, considering 
the implications of what he had 
just done. It seemed apparent, he 
thought, that what he had actually 
accomplished was to turn himself 
about the way a paper figure would 
be turned on a turntable — the dif- 
ference between this and ordinary 
methods being that as he was 
now facing in the opposite direc- 
tion, his head was now where his 
feet had been and vice versa. Or, 
to orient more exactly by existing 
landmarks, where the force field 
had flipped him into position with 
his head toward the right wall, his 
rotation had changed him so that 
now his head was toward the op- 
posite wall, the one originally on his 
left. 

Conclusion? 

Jack winced. The field itself ap- 
peared to be a two-dimensional 
phenomenon; and he, himself, 

TURNABOUT 



caught up in it, to be restricted to 
two-dimensional movement. For a 
second the thrill of panic came 
back, and he was forced to fight for 
a moment before he could go back 
to looking at the situation sensibly 
and calmly. 

The field appeared to be on a 
level with his waist as it had been 
when he had been standing normal- 
ly upright. That was, in effect, level 
with the tops of the upright rods 
that had been supposed to generate 
the field between them. Hah! — be- 
tween them, thought Jack, bitterly 
— And a few inches above the level 
of the benches. As he looked down 
the length of the room he noticed 
that whatever had touched the 
plane of the field at any point 
seemed to have been, like himself, 
caught up in it. He noticed a ham- 
mer and a soldering iron, both of 
which had been hanging from 
hooks on the left wall, now floating 
stiffly at right angles to it. Further- 
more, there seemed to have been 
some sort of polarity involved. In 
both cases the end which had been 
upright was at the left and the 
down end out at the right — that 
was, of course, from his present 
point of view — and corresponded 
exactly with the fact that his own 
head had gone to the right, and his 
feet to the left. 

But that was enough observing. 
The thing to do now was to get to 
the generator and turn it off before 
something else happened. Jack 
closed his eyes and made three 
quick steps, right foot first left foot 
following, toe to heel. When he 
opened them again he was mildly 
surprised to discover that he was 
still a little short of the end of the 
room, but a couple more steps 

93 




solved that problem. He rotated 
himself through a ninety degree 
arc and stepped up into the narrow 
alcove that noused the generator 
and the timer on a bench at its far 
end. 

He banged his head on the wall 
and blinked with the shock of it. 
He opened his eyes and looked 
down at the generator. 

With a sudden, sickening sense 
of shock, he realized that it was 
below him, and therefore outside of 
the plane of the field. His despera- 
tion was strong enough to make 
him reach for it, anyway, and to 
his surprise it seemed almost to flow 
upward to reach his fingers and his 
fingertips pushed against a short 
length of wire, which bent before 
them. 

As they did so, there was a sud- 
den flare of red light, from the coil 
and he snatched his fingers away as 
he noticed that that part of the 
generator was apparently red hot, 
glowing into incandescence. The 
whole apparatus, in fact, seemed 
to quiver on the point of exploding 
into flame. Curiously, however, 
there was no sensation of heat em- 
anating from the coil; and what 
was apparently a wisp of smoke, 
rising above the generator and out 
of the field, seemed frozen in mid- 
air. 

Cautiously Jack retreated slightly 
from the generator. Two things 
were immediately apparent. One, 
that the generator was evidently a 
part of the field, and reachable, 
even though it had not been in the 
original plane as he had. Two, that 
he had better be careful how he 
went about shutting it off*. It struck 
him somewhat belatedly that Rep- 
pleman’s explosion had probably 

94 



occurred through mishandling the 
generator when it was in its present 
state. 

No, the way to turn the generator 
off was the way it had been turned 
on — through the timer. He looked 
at the portion of the generator and 
bench that lay below him but did 
not see the timer. Then he remem- 
bered that this was the left side of 
the bench at the alcove’s extremity 
and that the timer was at the right. 
Carefully he rotated to the right 
as far as the narrow width of the 
alcove would allow him and out of 
the corner of his eye, caught a 
glimpse of the timer on the bench 
far to the right. The position was 
an awkward one, but he was in no 
mood to consider comfort. It might 
be interesting for a while to be the 
two-dimensional inmate of a single 
plane, but the novelty wore off 
quickly. He pushed his head into 
the right hand corner of the alcove 
and started to reach back past his 
hip to the timer. 

It was impossible. 

For a moment he hung still, 
stunned. Then as the truth pene- 
trated, he had to restrain an urge 
to burst into hysterical laughter. Of 
course, being two-dimensional he 
could not move the line of his 
hand past the line of his body, any. 
more than a normal three-dimen-' 
sional person in a three-dimen- j 
sional world can lie on his side on a

field, he would never be able to

to panic and scrabbled around, try- 
ing to find a position from which 
he could reach the timer, but the 
alcove was too small to allow him 
his necessary two-dimensional turn- 
ing radius. He stopped finally, and 
common sense came to his aid. 

Of course, the thing to do was to 
back out where there was room and 
turn around, so that he could come 
in facing in the other direction. 

He moved back out into the long 
part of the room, mentally berating 
himself for having lost his head. He 
closed his eyes and rotated. He was 
getting quite used to this business 
of blinding himself while moving 
and made a mental note that 
eventually he must get around to 
keeping his eyes open just to get a 
clearer picture of what happened, 
when he did move. Reversed, he 
stepped back up into the alcove. 

He opened his eyes to find him- 
self not in the alcove but against 
the wall of the long room opposite 
the alcove. For a moment he stared 
in puzzlement, then understanding 
came. 

“Of course,” he said. “I’m re- 
versed. I’ll have to step down ” 

He did so. Two steps down took 
him into the alcove. He opened his 
eyes to find himself finally facing 
the corner which housed the timer 
— but his feet were the parts of him 
next to it, and his head and hands 
were away from it. 

This is ridiculous! he thought. 
One way it’s behind my back and 
the other way it’s down by my feet. 
He crouched down, trying to 
squeeze himself into the corner close 
enough so that he could reach the 
timer. But it was no use. The alcove 
was too narrow to allow him to put 
his feet in the opposite corner and 

TURNABOUT 



lean far enough over so that his 
hands could manipulate the timer. 
The sort of person who can bend 
over and put both hands flat on the 
floor could have done it easily, but 
Jack, like most males of more or less 
sedentary occupation, was not in 
that kind of shape. He tried kneel- 
ing, squeezing himself as tightly in- 
to the right hand corner as he 
could. But here the earlier prohibi- 
tion of his two-dimensional exist- 
ence came again into effect and he 
was blocked by his own knees. Not 
only did he have to reach around 
them, but they blocked off his view 
of the timer. 

In a cold sweat, he finally gave 
up and backed put into the relative- 
ly open space of the long part of the 
room. It was fantastic. There was 
the timer directly in front of him. 
A touch of the finger would shut 
it off, for he could see its pointer 
frozen on the mark where it had 
turned the generator on. And it 
was a part of the field like the 
generator wire he had touched, so 
presumably he could move it. Yet, 
because of the restrictions of two- 
dimensional space, it was out of his 
reach. 

To Jack, a born and native three- 
dimensioner, it seemed grossly un- 
fair; and for one of the few times 
in his life he blew up. 

After having cursed out force- 
fields, force-field inventors, all 
known physical laws, the generator, 
Paul, and himself for being a damn 
fool and daydreaming when he 
should have been watching the 
timer, he found himself feeling 
somewhat better. From being ex- 
cited, he suffered a reaction to 
calmness. Let’s look at this sensibly, 
he told himself. 

95 




He reminded himself that he’d 
been acting like a wild animal 
caught in a trap, rather than a 
thinking man. The thing to do was 
to make an effort to understand 
what it was that had hold of him 
rather than just fighting it blindly. 
If he could not reach the timer, he 
could not reach the timer. What 
other possibilities were there? 

One — somebody, say perhaps 
Paul, would eventually come in and 
perhaps he could turn the timer 
off. Jack shook his head. No, who- 
ever stepped through the door of 
the room would probably be caught 
up in the field the way he had been. 
If indeed, the field was limited only 
to the room and did not extend be- 
yond its walls already. Jack bright- 
ened. If the field was bounded by 
the room, then all he had to do was 
get out of it — 

Painfully he maneuvered himself 
around until he was facing the 
door. The doorknob was below the 
field, but he had hopes of hooking 
his fingers onto the door’s loose edge 
and pulling it open. It was a hope 
that was doomed to disappoint- 
ment. Jack discovered that in two 
dimensions you could push, with 
fingertips, but not grab. The door, 
presumably because it was hinged 
to the walls outside the scope of the 
field, was strictly immovable. 

It appeared to be a rule that 
whatever was loose and touched by 
the field, was picked up by it, but 
whatever was attached to anything 
else beyond the limits of the field 
was not. It did not strictly make 
sense, because where do you draw 
the line of attachment? His body 
was attached to his limbs and his 
limbs had been outside the field. A 
matter of relative mass? 



Concluding this to be an unre- 
warding field for speculation, Jack 
returned to the matter of field size, 
and at that moment it suddenly 
dawned on him that all this time 
the window at the end of the room 
had been open. If he could get out 
through that and beyond the limits 
of the field — 

The wish was father to the act. 
Hardly had the thought occurred to 
him before he was jockeying for 
position in line with the window. 
He got it — back in the same posi- 
tion in which he had first found 
himself when the field caught him 
up — and simply walked out, pre- 
senting the unusual spectacle of a 
man strolling through mid-air while 
lying on his right side. It was all so 
easy that for the first time he found 
cause to wonder about the fact that 
the walking motion enabled him to 
progress when he was apparently 
doing nothing more than flailing 
the empty air. He experimented a 
little and discovered that he had 
the sensation of pressing back 
against something whenever he 
moved. Apparently the field had 
some kind of substance of its own, 
or a type of tension that reacted 
like an elastic skin when pressed 
longitudinally. 

As soon as he was free of the 
building he rotated abruptly and 
walked sideways alongside it. His 
hope was that the field would be 
cut off by any solid obstacle. He 
traveled for some little distance be- 
fore he admitted to himself that 
this hope was vain. Cheerfully, the 
field continued to buoy him up and 
imprison him, even when he 
reached the street in front of the 
labs. 

The street was unusually silent 
GORDON R. DICKSON 



96 




and deserted. For a moment he 
considered waiting until somebody 
came by to help. But his natural 
shyness and sensitivity to embarrass- 
ment overcame the idea, and he 
turned back to cruise once more 
along the side of the building peer- 
ing in the windows, with the hope 
of locating Paul himself, or at least 
someone connected with the labs. 

The windows on the back and 
the side he had been down were all 
closed and the door had taught him 
that there was no use dealing with 
any three-dimensional object unless 
it was, like him, caught up in the 
field. He crossed past his own open 
window and started down the far 
side of the building. 

Here there were several open 
windows, but they all gave on emp- 
ty offices. But toward the front he 
came to one through which he 
could glimpse figures, at the far 
end. Without hesitation, he closed 
his eyes and stepped through the 
opening. 

When he opened his eyes inside 
the room, he was astonished to see 
a tableau that was more than even 
his overactive imagination had 
ever conceived. Before him were 
Paul and Eva. They stood facing 
each other in a small room that 
seemed to be a sort of combination 
office and laboratory. Paul was 
leaning forward and his hand was 
on the smock-sleeved arm of Eva, 
who was pulling away from him. 

For a moment the implications 
of the scene did not penetrate. 
When they did, Jack went skidding 
through the air toward the two 
figures, too angry even to remember 
to close his eyes. 

When the grey field winked away 

TURNABOUT 



to reveal the room in its proper 
dimensions again, he found himself 
floating in mid-air beside and a 
little above them. This room was 
evidently lower than the one from 
which he had started ; and he 
glared down at the top of Paul’s 
stubbled head and cut loose. 

It was a fine exhibition of sizzling 
language, punctuated by flashes of 
streaky greyness, when in his excite- 
ment he forgot himself and moved 
or jerked his head. But when at 
last he began to run down, he was 
somewhat astonished to discover 
that neither of the people below 
had moved or shown any reaction 
to his presence. They had not even 
looked up. 

In fact, Paul was still clutching 
Eva’s arm and Eva was still lean- 
ing backward. They had not moved 
at all. 

An awful suspicion struck Jack 
with the impact of a solid fist to the 
pit of the stomach. He had assumed 
until now that the timer had some- 
how stuck at the position in which it 
activated the generator, that no ex- 
plosion had taken place because he 
had been careful after that first 
crimson flare not to monkey with 
the working parts of the generator. 
It had not occurred to him that 
the field in restricting him to two 
dimensions might really have re- 
stricted him to two dimensions. 

Frantically he rotated until he 
was able to spot a large electric 
wall clock above the door of the 
room. Its hands were frozen at 
twelve minutes after two, and the 
long sweep-second hand stood mo- 
tionless a little beyond the figure 12. 
He rotated back to where he could 
view the two people below. On the 
thick wrist above the hand that 

97 




held Eva’s arm was a large gold 
wristwatch, and this also stood with 
its hands immovably at twelve min- 
utes after two. Jack was caught, not 
merely in a single plane, but in a 
single instant of time. 

Up until now he had not really 
despaired. Always in the back of his 
mind had been the notion that even 
if he failed completely, sooner or 
later someone would come to his 
rescue. 

Now he realized that no rescue 
was possible. 

S OMEHOW he survived that 
realization. Possibly because he 
was the kind of man who does sur- 
vive, the sort of person who by 
birth and training has been edu- 
cated to disbelieve in failure. It was 
just not in him to accept the fact 
that he was hopelessly trapped. And 
particularly in support of this was 
the discovery he had just made 
about Paul and Eva. 

He looked down at them, with a 
sort of bleak clarity of understand- 
ing that he had never succeeded in 
obtaining before. He realized now 
that he had been — for all effective 
purposes — blind while Eva had 
been working with him at the 
University. 

He had introduced Paul to Eva 
himself some six months back when 
the other man had dropped by to 
see him on one of his occasional 
forays into the academic area in 
search of likely hired help. Jack had 
not considered the introduction im- 
portant. It had not occurred to him 
that Paul would find Eva the sort of 
woman he would want. In fact if 
anyone had asked him about such 
a combination, he would have 

98 



thought it rather funny. The two, 
by his standards, were opposite as 
the poles — Eva, with her cool 
depths, and Paul with his violent 
surface huckstering. It had not 
aroused Jack’s suspicion that Paul 
should visit frequently during the 
months that followed, and that his 
visits should stop with Eva leaving 
the U. 

No, Jack had been blind to the 
possibility of anyone else wanting 
Eva but himself, obsessed by the 
battle with his inner shyness that 
twiddled its thumbs and hoped 
vainly for a fortuitous set of circum- 
stances that would do his wooing 
for him. Paul might not have the 
inner strength that had just brought 
Jack through where poor Repple- 
man had foundered, but he had 
push, and guts enough in his own 
way. While Jack dreamed, he had 
carried off Eva; and now, at this 
late date Jack was finally waking 
up to the fact that where the mat- 
ing instinct is concerned we are 
still close enough to our animal 
forebears to have to fight for our 
partners on occasion. 

He swung around and made his 
way once more out of the room. 
He needed space to think. 

Once more in the bright sunlight 
outside, in the eternal out-of-doors 
of twelve minutes after two on a 
warm June afternoon, he continued 
his survey of the situation he was 
in. But he returned to it with the 
cold, dispassionate viewpoint of the 
trained mind. He marshalled the 
facts he had learned about his sit- 
uation and considered them. They 
amounted to the following: 

He was involuntarily imprisoned 
in what appeared to be a plane of 
two dimensions only and of un- 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




known extent. 

He was kept prisoner by a device 
operating at this moment. 

The natural restrictions of move- 
ment in two dimensions, plus a 
matter of his original position in the 
plane, prevented him from reach- 
ing the means by which he could 
shut off the device. 

Problem: How to shut off the 
device? 

He returned to the room housing 
the generator and examined it. He 
studied the objects that, like him- 
self, had been caught up in the 
field. He could not grasp any of 
them, but he could push them 
around within the limits of the 
field. It would, he thought, prob- 
ably be quite possible to push the 
hammer, say, into the core of the 
generator and short it out. Also, 
probably quite fatal, if Paul had 
been telling the truth about the ex- 
plosion. Reppleman had probably 
done some such thing. But he was 
in a rest home now with, again ac- 
cording to Paul, a complete block 
on the whole business. Still, the 
hammer possibility might be con- 
sidered as a last-ditch measure. 

“I have only begun to fight,” 
quoted Jack softly to himself. 

He studied the two upright rods 
from the top ends of which the field 
was generated. A thought occurred 
to him and he measured the dis- 
tance between them (about three 
feet as nearly as he could estimate 
by eye) and the length of the room 
to the window in front of which he 
had been standing. He remembered 
that it had taken him more steps 
than he had expected to reach the 
generator from the window. He 
checked this and discovered that 
the first step back from the window 

TURNABOUT 



was about the length of his normal 
stride, but that the second was only 
slightly more than half that, and 
the third diminished in proportion. 

He returned to the window, went 
through it to the outside, and 
checked his stride in the opposite 
direction. His first step out from 
the window in a direct line away 
from the rods of the generator was 
not quite double his normal stride. 
With the next it doubled again, and 
half a dozen steps saw him sweeping 
over the countryside with giant’s 
steps. 

On impulse he closed his eyes 
and continued outward. After a few 
more steps he stopped and opened 
his eyes to look. Earth lay like an 
enormous, white-flecked disc below 
him. Space was around him. For a 
second, instinctively, he tried to 
gasp for air, then realized with a 
start that he was not breathing, nor 
had he been breathing for some 
time. Such things, evidently, were 
unnecessary in two dimensions. 

He looked back down at Earth 
then ahead into space. Reppleman 
had gone mad at the end and 
wrecked the generator. But Repple- 
man was Reppleman; and he was 
— Jack. Moreover he had a score to 
settle back in his normal world. 
And he had every intention of get- 
ting back to settle it. 

How far, he thought, had Repple- 
man wandered, before he had come 
back to destroy the thing that held 
him? The thought was morbid and 
he shook it from him. Firmly he 
faced away from the world and 
strode outward. For a moment he 
twinkled like a dot among the stars. 
And then he was gone, stepping 
into enormous distances with ever- 
increasing stride. 

99 




J ACK closed the door of the little 
workroom behind him and 
turned left in the corridor outside. 
He went down the corridor, count- 
ing doors. At best it would have to 
be a guess, but if his estimate was 
right the room he wanted should 
be — 

This one. 

He pushed open the door and 
stepped in, interrupting two people 
in the midst of an angry argument. 
For a moment they stood frozen, 
interrupted and staring at him, and 
then Eva literally flew into his arms, 
while Paul’s astonishment faded to 
a bitter smile and he sat down on 
a comer of the desk beside him and 
crossed his arms. 

“Oh, Jack!” choked Eva. “Jack!” 
Jack folded her in his long arms 
almost automatically, with a feeling 
of bewilderment that gradually 
gave way to one of pleasure. He 
had never seen the calm, self-con- 
tained Eva moved like this before; 
and the corresponding role it de- 
manded of him was rather attrac- 
tive. He felt sort of contented and 
self-righteous ; and at the same time 
as if he ought to do something 
dramatic, like, say, picking up Paul 
and breaking him in half, or some 
such thing. 

At that, however, it was Paul who 
got in the first punch. 

“She’s worried about you,” he 
said, dryly, jerking a thumb at Eva. 

“You are?” demanded Jack, 
looking down at her. 

“Oh Jack!” said Eva. “You 
mustn’t do it. You don’t know how 
dangerous it is!” 

“What is?” asked Jack, becoming 
bewildered again. 

“The field,” put in Paul, as dryly 
as before. 

100 



“Oh that,” said Jack. “Well—” 
“You don’t know what it’s like,” 
interrupted Eva. “I was here when 
they took Max Reppleman out 
after the explosion. Jack — ” 

“Never mind that,” said Jack, 
strongly. “Paul said you were wor- 
ried about me.” 

“Jack, please listen. That whole 
business is dangerous — ” 

“You wouldn’t be worried about 
me unless you were — well worried 
about me,” said Jack stubbornly. 
His blood was up now. He had al- 
most lost this girl once to Paul 
through hesitation and delay. “Eva 
— ” He tightened his grasp on her 
— “I love you.” 

“Jack, will you lis — ” Eva 
stopped suddenly. Color flooded her 
face. She stared up at him in 
shocked speechlessness. 

“Eva,” said Jack, quickly, taking 
advantage of this golden oppor- 
tunity and talking fast. “Eva, I fell 
in love with you back at the Univer- 
sity, only I was always looking for 
the right chance to tell you and I 
didn’t get around to it because I 
was afraid of making some mistake 
and losing you. And when you left 
and went to work for Paul I gave 
up, but I’ve changed my mind. Eva 
will you marry me right now, to- 
day?” 

Eva tried to speak a couple of 
times but no sourjd came out. 

“The whirlwind lover,” said Paul 
somewhere in the background. 
“Well?” demanded Jack. 

“Jack, I — ” trembled Eva. 
“Never mind,” said Jack, break- 
ing in on her. “Because I won’t take 
no for an answer. Do you hear me?” 
He paused for a second to be as- 
tonished at his own words. “You’re 
going to marry me right away.” 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




“Ye gods!” said Paul. He might 
have saved his breath. Neither one 
of the other two was paying atten- 
tion to him. 

Jack let her go, and looked at 
Paul. 

“Paul—” he said. 

“Yes sir ! 39 responded Paul, get- 
ting up from the desk and popping 
exaggeratedly to attention. 

Jack looked at him with the 
jaundiced eye of a conquering gen- 
eral for his defeated rival. Though 
temporarily vanquished, this man 
was still potentially dangerous. Pro- 
ceed with plan B? asked the front 
part of his mind. Proceed with plan 
B, responded the back of his mind. 

“Paul,” he said. “Fve got the 
answers for you on the field.” 

Paul’s ironic pose slowly relaxed. 
A wary, calculating look came into 
his eye. 

“What?” he said. 

“I’ll show you,” Jack said. “Come 
on with me. You too, Eva.” 

And he turned on one heel and 
led the way out of the room. 

“You see,” said Jack, “you were 
wrong in your picture of what the 
generator does.” They were all 
three standing in the little L-shaped 
room and Jack had just told them 
what had happened to him. “It 
doesn’t produce a field at all. What 
it does is affect certain types of ob- 
jects close to it so that they become 
restrictd to a certain limited two- 
dimensional plane in a single mo- 
ment of time. The generator itself 
tries to exist both in this and in 
normal space at the same time, with 
the result that it blows up — what 
you might call a paradox explosion 
— not after some seconds, but im- 
mediately. Of course, this doesn’t 

TURNABOUT 



affect what’s been caught up in the 
single moment-and-plane, because 
for them that single instant is 
eternity.” 

“But it didn’t blow up on you,” 
said Paul. 

“I turned it off before it had a 
chance to,” replied Jack, a little 
grimly. 

“Now wait,” said Paul. “Wait. 
You just finished telling us you 
couldn’t reach the timer switch be- 
cause of your position which was 
essentially unchangeable in two- 
dimensional space. How did you 
turn it off? In fact, how did you 
ever get back?” 

Jack smiled coolly. 

“What happens to a plane in 
curved space?” 

Paul frowned. 

“I don’t get it,” he said. 

“It curves, of course,” answered 
Jack. “And where it’s dependent 
upon something like the generator, 
it curves back eventually to it.” 

Paul’s eyes narrowed. 

“Well—” he hesitated. “What 
good did knowing that do you, 
though? You could walk clear 
around the circle and still not 
change your position so as to reach 
the timer switch.” 

“Ah yes,” said Jack. “If it was 
just a simple circle. But it was a 
Moebius strip.” 

“Now wait — •” cried Paul. 

“You wait,” said Jack. “How 
many points determine a plane?” 

“Three.” 

Jack turned and walked down 
the length of the room to where 
the two upright rods still stood con- 
nected to the generator. He touched 
their tips. 

“And how many points do we 
have here?” 

101 




Paul looked bewildered. 

“Two,” he said. “But—” 

“Then where’s the third point we 
need? As a matter of fact you’re 
standing right at it.” 

Paul started in spite of himself 
and moved slightly aside. 

“What do you mean?” he asked. 

“The third point,” said Jack, “is 
the focal point of the two lines of 
force emanating from the two rod 
tips. They converge right in the 
middle of the window at the far end 
of the room there.” 

“But I still don’t see!” said Paul. 

“You will,” said Jack. He turned 
and stepped into the alcove. There 
was a moment’s silence, then the 
sound of tearing paper and he 
stepped back out holding a long 
thin strip of newspaper. He walked 
back to Paul. 

“Let’s see your thumb and fore- 
finger,” he said. “Now look here. 
This one end of the strip for the 
length of about an inch we’ll say is 
the part of the plane in this room 
that’s determined by the three 
points, the two rod tips and the 
focal point of their lines of force. 
Hold that.” 

He transferred one end of the 
strip to Paul’s fingers. Paul held it 
pinched between thumb and fore- 
finger and watched. 

“Now,” went on Jack, demon- 
strating, “the plane goes out like 
this and around like this and back 
like this in a big loop and the end 
approaches the generator between 
your fingers again. It comes in here 
and the last inch of it goes back be- 
tween your fingers, and there you 
are, reversed and ready to shut off 
your timer.” 

“Wait,” said Paul, now holding 
the two ends pinched between his 

102 



fingers together and the big loop 
of paper strip drooping in mid- 
air. “Why does the end come back 
in the same place? Why doesn’t it 
just circle around behind and touch 
ends?” 

“For two reasons,” answered 
Jack. “The plane must end where it 
began. Right?” 

“Yes.” 

“But,” said Jack. “To remain the 
same plane it must have the same 
three points in common. And the 
plane takes its position from the 
focal point, not the two rod tips. 
The result is what you’ve got in 
your hand there, a loop with a little 
double tag end.” 

“But I don’t — well, never mind,” 
said Paul. “The important thing is 
that this is still a straight loop, with 
no twist in it at all. “You could 
never get reversed on this. This is 
no Moebius.” 

“Think again,” said Jack. “With 
that tag end it is.” He turned to 
Eva. “Gome on, Eva. We’ll leave 
Paul to figure this out while you 
and I go get our own affairs taken 
care of.” He took her hand and 
opened the door. 

“Hey!” cried Paul. “You can’t—” 

“Oh yes, I can,” said Jack, turn- 
ing in the open doorway. “I’ve an- 
swered all your questions. Just take 
an imaginary little two-dimensional 
figure and run him around that 
strip of newspaper. You’ll see.” 

And he led Eva out the door, 
closing it behind them. Once in the 
corridor, however, he took her 
shoulders in his two big hands and 
backed her against the wall. 

“Tell me,” he said. “Just why did 
you quit me at the U. and come 
down here?” 

Eva looked guilty. 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




“He— Paul said—” 

“What did he say?” 

“He said,” hesitated Eva, “you’d 
always told him you never intended 
to marry anyone.” A small note of 
defiance came into her voice. 
“What was I going to do? Every 
day I’d come to work and you’d 
be there, and you never said any- 
thing — ” she broke off suddenly, 
eyeing him curiously. “Why did 
you ask me that now, Jack?” 
“Because,” said Jack. “For a 
minute I was tempted to save Paul 
a walk — a long, long walk.” 

She stared up at him. 

“I don’t understand.” 

He smiled and took her hand. 
“Some day,” he said tenderly, 
“some day when we are very old 
and married and well supplied with 
grandchildren, I’ll tell you all about 
it. Okay?” 

She was too much in love with 
him to protest — then. 

“Okay,” she smiled back. 

They went down the corridor to- 
ward the door leading out to the 
parking lot behind the labs. 

I N THE room Paul stood frown- 
ing at the strip of paper in his 
hand. It didn’t seem possible, but it 
was. He had just finished walking, 
in imagination, a little two-dimen- 
sional man all the way around the 



strip; and, sure enough, he had 
ended up facing in the opposite 
direction. It was simple enough. 
But it wasn’t a Moebius. Or was it? 
If the two ends were one end — 

Outside on the parking lot he 
heard the roar of a motor; and he 
looked up to see a battered old blue 
business coupe make its turn on the 
gravel expanse and head out the 
driveway. As it passed it stopped; 
and Jack stuck his head out the car 
window to shout something to him. 
Paul stepped to the window. 

“What?” he yelled.. 

Jack’s words came indistinctly to 
him over the distance and the racket 
of the ancient motor. 

“ — I said — stay right where you 
are — ” 

“What?” roared Paul.' 

But Jack had pulled in his head 
and the car pulled ahead out the 
driveway and into the street. Paul 
watched it merge with the traffic 
and get lost in the distance. 

What had Jack said? Stay right 
where you are? Why should he stay 
right where he was? 

Suddenly he felt the unexpected 
cold squeeze of suspicion. It 
couldn’t be that Jack would — 

— Behind him and from the di- 
rection of the timer, came the sound 
of a soft, insidious click . • • •

JOURNEY WORK 



Get mad, old man, but don’t give up; you’re not through 
by a long shot. Somewhere there’s a job for you, 
a job that youth can’t do ... a dangerous job, but a good 
one that’ll bring you fame, fortune and peace . 



BY DAVE DRYFOOS 



I N A CENTRAL California to- 
mato field a dusty-faced man 
opened the autodriver of a nuclear- 
powered truck and inserted a can- 
nery’s address card so the truck 
would know where to deliver its 
load. 

Six old men — the tomato pickers 
— waited for their pay in the truck’s 
lengthening shadow. Most of them 
smoked or dozed, too tired for talk. 

Ollie Hollveg, tallest and oldest of 
the pickers, eyed the heavy-set 
rancher who sat at the tally table 



figuring the payroll. For this day’s 
work Ollie expected even less pay 
than usual; the mumbling, pencil- 
licking rancher-^-his name was Rost 
— seemed to be overacting the role 
of harried proprietor. 

Soon Ollie saw his guess con- 
firmed. A look of frustrated rage 
spread from face to face as each of 
the other pickers was in turn called 
to the table and paid. 

All were overage. None dared 
protest. 

At seventy a poor man without 



104 





relatives willing to care for him was 
supposed to let himself be perma- 
nently retired to a Home for Seniles. 
If he wasn’t senile and didn’t want 
a home with barred windows and a 
barbed wire fence, he had to lie 
low and keep his mouth shut. 

Anyone could charge an overage 
person with incompetence. The 
charge was not a crime and so had 
no defence. 

All of which was old stuff to 
Ollie Hollveg. He’d been dodging 
the geriatricians for sixteen years. 
He considered himself used to the 
setup. 

Yet something about the rancher, 
Rost — maybe his excessive weight, 
in contrast with the pickers’ under- 
fed gauntness, or maybe his card- 
board cowboy boots and imitation 
sombrero — made Ollie boil in spite 
of himself. 

He tried not to show his feelings. 
But when he was called to the tally 
table the rancher scowled up at 
him defensively and said, “Don’t 
glare at me, Hollveg! If you moved 
as fast picking tomatoes as you do 
collecting your pay, you’d have 
earned more than this.” 

He pushed out a little pile of 
coins that came to four dollars 
eighty-seven cents. 

“Odd pennies?” Ollie’s voice 
broke as he fought to keep it under 
control. “Odd pennies, when pick- 
ing’s at the rate of two bits a lug? 
That can’t be right. Just because 
we’re old, you’re stealing from us!” 

Rost’s fat face turned livid. “Call 
me a thief?” he sputtered. “Get off 
my land!” 

Rost jumped clumsily to his feet, 
upsetting the tally table. Ollie bent 
to retrieve the coins scattered in the 
dust. 



105 



“Don’t try to steal from me!” 
Rost shouted. He pulled out a small 
gas gun and discharged it under 
Ollie’s nose. Ollie pitched forward 
onto his face, twitched, moaned, 
and lay still. 

The deputy sheriff held an 
ampoule under his nose and 
brought him to after setting the 
squad car on the beamway, pro- 
ceeding under remote control to- 
ward the county seat. 

The first thing Ollie thought of 
was his day’s pay. He’d never re- 
ceived it. Worse — his bedroll was 
left behind. And there was no stop- 
ping nor turning on the beam way. 

He complained bitterly. 

“You won’t need that stuff,” the 
sharp young deputy said. “Not 
where you’re going.” 

“I suppose Rost needs it!” Ollie 
protested. 

“He might at that. All he’s got 
is those measily four rented acres 
of tomatoes. The cannery pays him 
the same as if he had four hundred 
acres and could pick by machine. 

“About all the profit he can make 
is what he chisels out of his pickers. 
You’ll be better off in a Home, Pop, 
than trying to work cheaper than 
a machine.” 

“Those Homes are prisons!” 

The deputy sighed. “I know how 
you feel. My old grandfather cried 
when we put him in. But we 
couldn’t support him and he had 
no way of making a living. 

“The world changes faster than 
the people in it, Pop. Science all 
the time lets us live longer, but 
faster and faster it keeps changing 
the way we do things. An old guy 
falls so far behind the times, the 
only place for him is a Home.” 

106 



“But if a man wants to stay out,” 
said Ollie, “I don’t see why he 

3 . JJ 

can t. 

“Old guys are dangerous to the 
rest of us. I saw three people killed, 
not long ago, trying to dodge an 
oldtimer who walked too slow to get 
across a wide street before the lights 
changed against him.” 

“They could have slowed the 
signal,” Ollie said. “But no! Always 
it’s the man who has to adapt to the 
machine, not the machine to the 
man. The only way to get by in 
this world is to find some machine 
you just naturally fit.” 

“You sound kind of bitter.” 
“Why not? I used to be a stock 
control clerk, keeping track of spare 
parts supply for a nationally dis- 
tributed line of machine tools. I had 
twenty girls working for me. Then 
one day they put in a big com- 
puter.” 

He sighed. “No wonder these 
suicide salesmen do so well. If I 
had the money I’d hire somebody 
to knock me off right now.” 

“Don’t be stupid!” the deputy 
snarled. “You wouldn’t be losing 
your freedom if you’d had sense 
enough to stay out of a fight. And 
when you talk about suicide sales- 
men, you sure prove you can’t take 
care of yourself!” 

But the deputy was kinder than 
he sounded. Rather than allege in- 
competence, he charged Ollie with 
an assault against Rost. So instead 
of being remanded to the geriatri- 
cians, Ollie was kept overnight in 
jail and ordered held, next morn- 
ing, for want of fifty dollars bail. 

An hour after bail had been set, 
a dapper thin faced bailbond broker 
came to see him. 

“Want out?” 



DAVE DRYFOOS 




“Sure.” 

“If I put up bail you’ll be out.” 

“No Home?” 

“You’re classified as a criminal, 
ineligible for a Home till either 
you’re found not guilty or serve 
your time.” 

“Well, but I’m broke. I can’t 
buy a bailbond.” 

“You can work it off. I’m going 
to spring you right now. As soon 
as they let you out, meet me in the 
southwest corner of the park, just 
across from the post office.” 

Ollie did. He thought his bail 
had been arranged by the deputy. 

The broker kept him waiting in 
the park for half an hour, but was 
brisk when he appeared. 

“My name is Lansing,” he said. 
“Come on. We’re taking a little 
trip.” 

He steered Ollie to the copter 
tower at the park’s center and with 
him boarded its endless-belt man- 
lift. They were carried ten stories 
to the roof, and as they stepped off 
the manlift an empty copter 
hovered at hand. It bore on sides 
and bottom an address, a phone 
number, and the word Bailbonds , 
all in big letters. 

The copter rose under the tower’s 
control as soon as they’d entered 
it, and continued to rise till Lansing 
selected a prepunched destination 
card and slipped it into the auto- 
pilot. Then a knowing red light 
winked on, the copter levelled off 
and headed southwest, and Lansing 
took one of a pair of chintz-padded 
wicker seats, motioning Ollie into 
the other. 

“How do you like the idea of 
going to a Home?” he asked 
abruptly. 

“I’d rather be dead.” 



“I know someone who agrees 
with you. A fellow with bad health 
who wants to die but doesn’t have 
the guts to do the necessary. Feel 
like helping him out?” 

Ollie sighed, smiled grimly, and 
shook his head. “No, thanks!” 

“You might die yourself, Holl- 
veg.” Lansing’s voice was heavy 
with menace. 

“I might,” Ollie agreed hotly. 
“I might get murdered. And maybe 
the same thing will happen to this 
supposedly sick man you want me 
to help out. He may not want to 
die any more than I do. I’ve heard 
you suicide salesmen do a lot of 
murder-for-hire.” 

“You’ve heard too much, Holl- 
veg.” 

Lansing took a plushlined metal 
case from an inside pocket and re- 
moved from it a filled syringe, 
complete with needle. 

“This won’t hurt,” he said in a 
sneering imitation of a doctor. “But 
it’ll end your independence like a 
barbed wire fence.” 

Ollie began to sweat. “I’ve heard 
of those zombie-shots too,” he said. 
He looked wildly around, then con- 
trolled himself and gestured almost 
calmly toward the sky, land, and 
water visible through the cabin’s 
plastic walls. 

“Maybe you can put the needle 
away for a while,” he suggested. 
“I’m not going to walk out on you 
right now.” 

Lansing smiled and complied. 
“You may keep your health a long 
time yet,” he said urbanely. “If 
you’re sensible, we might even find 
steady work for you.” 

Ollie suppressed a shudder. 
Lansing tuned in a Western on 
the physeo. Soon the odor of sage 



107 



JOURNEY WORK 




and horse-sweat filled the cabin. 

Ollie watched avidly. He hadn’t 
seen enough physeo to be bored 
with it. 

There was a mouth watering 
camp supper scene, with pleasant 
odors of broiling beef and burning 
wood; and a stirring moonlit love 
scene with a wholesome girl who 
smelled of soap and starch, and 
only faintly of cosmetics. 

But then came the climactic 
chase, a combined stampede, stage- 
coach race, and Indian fight. So 
much alkali dust poured from the 
physeo that Ollie got a fit of cough- 
ing. 

He couldn’t stop. After several 
excruciating minutes he lay down 
on the floor and gasped to Lansing 
for a drink of water. 

“There isn’t any,” Lansing told 
him sharply. “And brother, you’d 
better get up from there, because 
you’ll have to move fast when we 
get to Frisco.” 

Without knowing what would 
result, Ollie made sure he neither 
got up nor stopped coughing till 
they reached San Francisco which 
was fifteen minutes later. 

The pretense involved intense 
effort for so old a man. His voice 
went. He was clammy with sweat 
from head to foot. His face was pale 
and his hands cold. 

By the time the copter reached 
the roof of San Francisco’s Union 
Square tower, Ollie was actually 
unable to jump out of the cabin in 
the thirty seconds allotted by the 
remote traffic-control system. Lan- 
sing tried to carry him out, but the 
result was merely a delay that 
damned the stream of traffic. 

A winged inspector buzzed them, 
took remote control of their copter, 

108 



and led it to the emergency tower 
at Civic center. 

Ollie was taken off on a stretcher. 
Lansing, his urbanity washed away 
in a flood of redfaced rage, was still 
in the copter when it rose. And the 
hypo was still in his pocket; with 
Ollie due to get medical attention, 
he hadn’t been able to use it. 

Ollie didn’t dare stay long in the 
hospital. As soon as his stretcher 
was set down on the receiving ward 
floor, he rolled out of it and with 
the help of a fat steward struggled 
to his feet. 

“Thanks,” he whispered hoarsely. 
“I have to go now.” 

“You can’t!” said the steward. 
“You haven’t even been examined 
yet.” 

“It’s against my religion to have 
to do with medicine,” Ollie im- 
provised. “Besides, I’m perfectly 
well.” 

“Yeah? What about your voice — 
or lack of one?” 

“A coughing spell. I’m over it 
now. And my voice is coming back.” 
It was. 

The steward unbuttoned his coat 
and scratched his belly meditatively. 
“If you don’t want treatment you 
don’t have to have it.” he said 
finally. “The joint’s overcrowded 
now.” 

Ollie didn’t congratulate himself 
when he got out. He was now a 
fugitive from both the geriatricians 
and the underworld. Soon the po- 
lice would want him for bail-jump- 
ing, and meanwhile they’d grab him 
for vagrancy if they caught him off 
skidrow. 

He headed that way at once, 
walking over to Mission and down 
it toward Third. A clock on a store- 
front said five twenty. He felt over- 

DAVE DRYFOOS 




due for supper and bed. 

He counted his change — three 
dollars and forty-two cents. He had 
no bedroll ; no overcoat, either. 
Even in this nice summer weather 
it might be a little tough for a fellow 
to get by on the road with so little 
plunder. Eighty-six was a trifle old 
for the rugged life. 

What he needed, of course, was 
a white-collar job. Not only needed, 
but deserved — he was a good clerk. 
Therefore he should go to the 
Hearst Building at Third and Mar- 
ket and scan the want ads posted 
there. As he’d been doing when in 
San Francisco for forty years. 

He thought of some of the many 
times he’d stared at that bulletin 
board. He’d gone there often dur- 
ing the years he’d worked as a con- 
struction timekeeper, before that 
skill became obsolete. Then there’ d 
been an interval when he’d sold 
rebuilt window washers — for a firm 
which still owed him money. And 
he’d haunted the board during 
the months he’d had that job 
in the automatic grocery, replenish- 
ing the dispensing machines’ mer- 
chandise. 

None of his jobs had come from 
a want ad. But he had to go look. 
It was a ritual. 



T HE YEARS had made the 
ritual a hard one for him. He 
could read the fine-printed columns 
only with head cocked an arm’s 
length away from a cheap reading 
glass held up to them. He took a 
lot of room ; forced a white-capped 
young mechanic to peer awkwardly 
around him. 

Embarrassed, Ollie moved out of 
the way. He’d begun to walk off 

JOURNEY WORK 



when the young fellow stopped him. 

“I don’t think you saw this one, 
Dad,” he said, pointing. 

OLDER MEN (the ad read) with- 
out dependents needed for danger- 
ous scientific experiments. If able 
to pass intensive physical and men- 
tal tests report for interview to 
Civilian Personnel Office, Short 
Air Force Base, Short, Utah. 

“I don’t know where the place is 
at all,” Ollie complained wearily. 

“Just this side of Salt Lake, on 
the main line,” the young man said. 
“I served there, so I’m curious. If 
you’re not — well — ” He shrugged 
and edged away. 

“Thanks, son,” Ollie called after 
him. “I’m going to follow that up.” 
The young man walked on with- 
out looking back. 

Ollie felt committed, not only by 
his offhand declaration, but by his 
ritual. He’d come to look for a job; 
he’d found one for which he was 
eligible; he must go after it. 

He headed down Third Street to- 
ward the freight yards but stopped 
at a skidrow restaurant for a bowl 
of stew and a cup of coffee. Passing 
an old-fashioned catchpenny gro- 
cery he went in and bought a half- 
dozen rolls to take with him. The 
proprietor, squat, unshaven, and 
swarthy, picked out a large red 
apple and slipped it in with the 
rolls. 

“Good for you,” he said, smiling. 
Ollie shook his head. 

The grocer frowned, then re- 
placed the apple with an orange. 
“Easier on teeth,” he said. 

“Thank you,” said Ollie, smiling. 
“You make me feel lucky. I’m an- 
swering a want ad — maybe I’ll get 
the job.” 

The grocer smiled vaguely. “I 

109 




hope.” Then his face livened. 
“What job? In paper?” 

“Yes.” There could be no other, 
for a man his age. 

“It says ‘dangerous/ ” said the 
grocer. “I think maybe they cut you 
up, find out how you live so long. 
Or make you sick to try new cure. 

“You find better job — or Home. 
That one bad.” There was a slight 
pause. 

“Look. I close soon. You sweep 
store, I give you dollar.” 

“You’re a good guy,” said Ollie. 
“But I’ve got three dollars now.” 
He showed them proudly. “You 
save yours for somebody who 
doesn’t have a job to try for.” 

He tucked the rolls and orange 
inside his shirt, marched valiantly 
out of the dark little store, and con- 
tinued on to the yards. 

The heavy traffic there con- 
fused him briefly. Transcontinental 
freight was carried in long trains 
of rubber-tired cars towed on ele- 
vated beamways by remotely-con- 
trolled, nuclear-fuqled steam trac- 
tors. Here at the San Francisco 
yards the trains were broken up and 
the individual cars hauled by turbo- 
tractor on city streets and suburban 
roads for delivery at the addressees’ 
doors. 

The cars were huge, the noise 
and bustle awe-inspiring. Ollie 
stood outside the main exit watch- 
ing the little tractors and big cars 
emerge, till a beamway bull came 
over, flashed a badge, and told him 
to move on. 

He did. He was a fugitive from 
so many things; he couldn’t afford 
resentments. 

He went on around the yards. 
They were vast. He felt sure that 
somewhere there must be an un- 

110 



guarded entry, and set out to find 
it, moving cautiously from shadow 
to shadow along the high plasti- 
board fence. 

Twice he blundered into watch- 
men. Once he nearly got himself 
run over. But after a couple of 
hours he saw a bindlestiff slip 
through an unguarded gate, and in 
half a minute he was right behind 
the man. 

Ollie moved away from him. 
There was safety in solitude. Be- 
sides, he had to find a Salt Lake 
train. 

The sealed cars were addressed 
like so many packages. But he had 
to have light to read by, and he 
risked discovery every time he 
moved into the light and took his 
stance behind the reading glass. 

There were other hazards; tele- 
vision beams for the yard clerks to 
read numbers by, invisible beams 
for the bulls to catch him with, 
headlights that suddenly flashed on 
blindingly, humped cars rolling un- 
attended on silent, murderous tires. 

Ollie felt like an ant on a busy 
sidewalk, liable to be crushed under 
foot at any moment. 

But an added hazard helped him 
find his train. The bulls had read 
that want ad too. They were out 
in force around a string of cars. 
He slipped between two sleepy- 
looking men, checked an address, 
and then slipped out again, cer- 
tain every car would be inspected 
before departure. 

A good way down the yard he 
hid at the base of the fence, dozing 
and shivering for several hours as 
he lay stretched out on the dew- 
chilled concrete. He checked each 
outbound train as it went by, and 
again knew his by the bulls on it. 

DAVE DRYFOOS 




They were on the cowcatcher 
and in the cab, on the car roofs, 
and in the caboose with the train- 
crew of three trouble-shooting me- 
chanics. Highlights gleamed on 
their weapons. Their job was to 
keep or get all transients off that 
train — and they would if they could. 

Ollie let most of the train go past. 
The caboose came by at about fif- 
teen miles an hour with a sharp- 
eyed guard head-and-shoulders out 
of the cupola. Ollie let him get past, 
too — and hoped he went on looking 
toward the front. 

He began to hobble parallel to 
the train, dismayed at the stiffness 
that had set in while he lay out on 
the damp concrete. 

As the rear of the caboose drew 
even with him he emerged from 
the shadows and dived for the 
coupling at the car’s rear. He 
caught it clumsily, tore the nail off 
his left ring finger, but hung on. 

He tried to trot but the train 
dragged him. He gave a leapfrog 
player’s jump and landed on top of 
his own hands, his thighs around 
the coupling, his nose against the 
rear platform-wall of the caboose. 

The engine jerked slack out of 
the long train and nearly dislodged 
him. One at a time he moved his 
hands from the coupling to the 
base of the wall. He edged in a little 
closer. The train gathered speed. 

He wasn’t really on but he 
couldn’t safely get off. He’d in- 
tended climbing under the caboose 
to its rear truck, but the bulls and 
his own lack of agility made this 
impossible so now he must ride 
where he was, exposed to battering 
wind and searching cold as the 
train crossed the High Sierras, and 
also exposed to the whims of the 

JOURNEY WORK 



trainmen if any should come out 
on the platform and look down. 

He’d seen men shot off trains. 
But he didn’t worry about it. In- 
stead, like the old hand he was, he 
tried to sleep while clinging there. 

At Sparks the train stopped for a 
maintenance check. The guards 
formed a perimeter but Ollie was 
inside it. Too stiff to move far, he 
stayed in a shadow while the me- 
chanics inspected, then he climbed 
under the caboose and stretched out 
on a girder separating two tires of 
the rearmost, six-tired truck. 

The tremendous tires fanned up 
hot winds when rolling, and these 
had warmed the steel he lay on. Be- 
fore the train started he ate a roll, 
sucked the orange, and stretched 
out face down for the speed run 
across the central Nevada flatlands. 

The guards stayed behind. After 
the train had started, one of them 
shined a light directly in Ollie’s 
eyes. 

The train kept on. And he was 
too close to the tires to be shot at; 
rubber-coated death whirled within 
three inches at either side of him. 

As the train picked up speed he 
was careful to lie still, but beyond 
making sure he didn’t touch the 
tires Ollie tried to put all thought 
of risk from his mind. 

He saw a sudden vivid picture 
of his dead wife and son as they’d 
looked before the . undertaker fixed 
them. They’d been killed while 
travelling. In times when to suc- 
ceed was to get somewhere, they’d 
been killed en route. He couldn’t 
remember where to. 

They’d died in a head-on crash 
caused by a stranger’s error in judg- 
ment. A thing that didn’t happen 

111 




any more, now that highway ve- 
hicles were controlled by beamed 
energy instead of individual drivers. 

The highway was one place 
where the human had been tested 
against the machine and found 
inferior. The office was another. If 
Minna and Charlie hadn’t died so 
long ago, they might have lived to 
see him now — a bindlestiff so low 
he even lacked a bindle. 

Still, it was lonely with no one in 
the whole wide world to care 
whether he lived or died. 

He sighed, shifted his position, 
and was nearly jerked under the 
wheels by sudden contact with the 
tire on his right. 

It was over in an instant. The tire 
simply ripped the coat from his 
back. 

He still wore the sleeves. The 
rest was gone. Weathered thread 
had saved him. 



H E HAD ample time to think 
about the irony of that before 
rosy dawnlight was reflected into his 
face from a glittering salt-pan. He 
knew then he was still west of Salt 
Lake City, and that Short Air Force 
Base was close. 

Also close, now that night had 
withdrawn its concealment, was dis- 
covery. He was sure to be found 
when next the train stopped. 

Therefore he eased himself out 
of his coatsleeves. He moved gin- 
gerly, but still chanced death to 
improve his appearance. 

The train slowed, stopped. 
Someone called, “Here he is,” 
and a redhaired Air Policeman 
leaned under the caboose, looked 
him over, and said, “Come on out, 
Pop.” 

112 



Ollie’s legs were stiff. The air- 
man had to help. 

“You’re in kind of rough shape,” 
he said. “Where did you think you 
were going?” 

“Why — uh — east.” Ollie cast 
down his eyes, ashamed even to 
admit he’d once entertained the 
notion he might get a job. 

The airman wasn’t fooled. “You 
slipped through the train guards 
after the job we’ve got here. Didn’t 
you, Pop?” 

“All I want is out,” said Ollie 
stubbornly. 

“Well,” said the airman, “you 
can’t get off the Base without a pass. 
You’ll have to go up to Civilian 
Personnel and get one.” 

“Can’t I wash first?” 

He could. He could also get a 
jeep ride to the terra cotta head- 
quarters building, with a stop along 
the way for a canteen-cup of coffee 
and a slice of bread. 

When they got to headquarters 
the airman asked, “Tell the truth, 
now; didn’t you really come after 
this job?” 

Ollie wouldn’t admit he’d lied 
about it, so he lied again. 

“I’ve seen some of the other guys 
come in after it,” the airman in- 
sisted, “and you look as good as any 
of them. Why not try for it, now 
you’re here?” 

He gave Ollie a long application 
to fill out and left him at a desk 
just outside the personnel office. 

From somewhere came the clat- 
ter of a facsimile-printer, carrying 
the day’s message from GHQ. A 
boy whistled above the squawk of 
a superwave radio. But otherwise 
the place seemed deserted at that 
early-morning hour. 

For lack of anything better to do, 

DAVE DRYFOOS 




Ollie filled out the application, leav- 
ing the job title blank. The only 
thing that gave him pause, aside 
from the difficulty of seeing, was 
his arrest record, and in time he 
decided to put it down just as it 
was, including the pending assault 
charge with its implication of 
jumped bail. 

After an hour a young captain 
entered the building and went to 
the office marked Adjutant. A fat 
major gave Ollie a piercing glance 
and then entered the Civilian Per- 
sonnel office. At about five minutes 
of eight the place suddenly boiled 
with military and civilian people of 
all ages and both sexes. 

Things quieted promptly at eight. 
A blond youth came out of the 
office, glanced at Ollie’s application 
form, kept it, and invited him in- 
side. 

“First thing for you,” he said, 
“will be a physical exam.” 

He took Ollie to another room 
and turned him over to a young 
medic who put him in a box like a 
steam cabinet, attached electrodes 
to his temples, wrists, ankles, and 
chest, and put a helmet on his head. 

For five minutes Ollie stood en- 
cased, his stomach fluttering as he 
recalled the grocer’s warning. He 
waited for the vivisection to begin. 

It didn’t. He was removed from 
his shell and handed an inked 
graph. 

“Here’s your profile,” the medic 
said. “It’s good, considering. Take 
it back to the fellow who brought 
you here.” 

He did and was ushered into a 
glassed-in office containing two 
desks, each labelled Civilian Per- 
sonnel Officer. At one sat the fat 
major. At the other, a tallish young 

JOURNEY WORK 



civilian held Ollie’s application. 

“My name is Katt,” the civilian 
said, getting up to shake hands. 
“This is Major Brownwight.” 

The major also shook his hand. 
Katt placed a straightbacked chair 
between the two desks, and invited 
Ollie to sit in it. Ollie did, gazing 
uncertainly from one man to the 
other. 

“We heard you arrived by train 
early this morning,” Katt said. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“You were first reported in 
Sparks, but I’ll bet you boarded 
that train in San Francisco.” 

“Yes, sir. What’s the penalty?” 

“None. I like it. It’s enterprising, 
athletic, and even brave for a man 
of your years to do that for a job. 
Shows resourcefulness. Also skill, 
because men are trying to nip rides 
here from all over the United 
States, but very few arrive.” 

“They’re too old,” said Major 
Brownwight. He turned to Katt and 
added, “I still don’t think it’s an old 
man’s job!” 

“Well sir,” said Katt, stifling a 
sigh, “your predecessor understood 
and approved of it. These old- 
timers have a lower metabolic rate 
than younger people, with all that 
that implies. They don’t mind the 
enforced inactivity, they won’t use 
up so much oxygen nor need so 
much food, they won’t spend so 
many hours in sleep. All qualities 
we need.” 

“Maybe so.” The major turned 
to Ollie and said, “I just transferred 
in here. You know more about this 
than I do.” 

“I don’t even know what you’re 
talking about,” Ollie told him. 

“Without divulging classified in- 
formation,” said Katt, “for which 

113 




you are not yet cleared, I can tell 
you these are little one-man jobs. 
Small stuff — for pioneering. That’s 
why we want you men with lots of 
patience, who’re used to being 
alone. People without a fixed place 
in society, and not too much to 
leave behind. A husky old itinerant 
like you is just what we want.” 
“For what?” Ollie insisted. 

“To travel — as a sort of working 
passenger, since piloting will of 
course be mechanical — in the first 
manned spaceships to leave Earth 
for the stars.” 

“Spaceships?” 

“Sure. Solo spaceships. Super- 
fast, which means the trip will seem 
relatively short while you’re on it, 
and will give you extra earth-years 
of life in the end. 

“The job is much easier and less 
hazardous than the trainride that 



brought you here. You’re a natural 
for it. You really fit it.” 

“Do I, now?” A quick glow of 
inner warmth melted many bad 
years away. Ollie grinned. 

“You know,” he said, “hi a way 
that’s a disappointment.” 

“How so?” asked the major ag- 
gressively. “Don’t you want the 
job?” 

“Yes, sir. I want it. But all these 
years I’ve been telling myself that 
somewhere on this earth was a place 
I’d fit into, if only I could find it. 
Now you tell me I fit in, but the 
place isn’t here on Earth after all!” 
“Not right now, no,” said Katt. 
“But you’ll be back. Rich and 
famous, too. No Home for you, Mr. 
Hollveg — you’ll have a nice place 
of your own.” 

And he did — after photographing 
the planets of Arcturus. # • • 



THE EARTH QUARTER (Continued from page 45) 



for orders; he had no idea where he 
might be sent after that. Cudyk had 
not yet made up his mind. He 
thought that perhaps he would go 
with the priest ; if he should change 
his mind after landing it would be 
no great loss; one wilderness, as 
Exarkos had once said, was as good 
as another. 

It will all be anticlimax, he 
thought, and perhaps that is the 
definition of Hell: unending anti- 
climax. 

He wondered how it would feel 
to be Earthbound again. The re- 
patriation ship was to be the last 
Galactic vessel which would ever 
call at Earth. And there would be a 
constant guard. The Niori had 
learned, belatedly but well. If hu- 
manity ever climbed high enough 



again to reach the stars with its 
bloody fingers, the citizens of the 
galaxy would be ready. 

Cudyk looked at his watch. The 
man in the powerhouse must be 
a sentimentalist ; he was waiting un- 
til the last possible moment. 

He heard the soft hum of the air- 
car behind him, turned and saw it 
settling lightly to the clipped lawn. 
The remaining passengers were 
moving toward it. Exarkos stood up 
and lifted his suitcase. Cudyk 
turned back for one last look at the 
Quarter. It was full dark now, and 
all he could see of it was the blocky, 
ambiguous outline of its darkness 
against the glowing buildings be- 
yond, and the cross-hatched pat- 
tern of yellow street lights. 

The lights went out. • # •

BY WINSTON MARKS 



WEDDING DAY 



Some folks say a good wife is a composite of many 
things . And sometimes a girl finds it tough . 

But with the ratio of the sexes drastically changed . 



A T BREAKFAST Polly and 
June had an argument over 
the coffee. Polly had brewed it. 
June thought it was too strong. 
Doris and Sue stayed out of the 
argument at first. 

Polly defended, “Sure, it’s a lit- 
tle stronger, but men like it strong. 
You might as well get used to it.” 
June said, “See here, he’s got to 
make some concessions. After all, 
why should four of us suffer — ” 
“Suffer? You call being married 
to Hollis Jamison suffering?” 

“Don’t be so impressed. He’s not 
doing badly marrying us, either. 
He could do a lot worse.” 

“Why, you vain witch! Just be- 
cause you play a fair game of 
chess — ” 

“Oh, I’m not taking all the 
credit. You’re a fine cook, Doris is 
witty and Sue’s body would make 



any man’s mouth water — but that’s 
just the point! Look what he’s get- 
ting! Why should we have to 
change all our habits and tastes to 
conform with his?” 

Now Doris entered the argu- 
ment. “You know darn well why! 
It’s still a man’s world and a man’s 
choice. Back when there was a 
man for practically every woman, 
it was different. But it’s five women 
to one man right now — don’t ever 
forget that — five to one, and so far 
the law only requires a quadracell. 
Just be grateful you aren’t the one 
who’s left out. You and your chess- 
playing! How far would you get at- 
tracting a man, all by yourself?” 
“Shhh, now, all of you,” Sue 
broke into the telepathic conversa- 
tion. “Let’s clear the dishes and 
get the apartment straightened up. 
Hollis did make one concession — 



115 




moving in with us, instead of mak- 
ing us live in that dismal bachelor’s 
hole of his. Let’s not make him re- 
gret it.” 

They heeded Sue and got busy. 
Sue was the arbiter. She ruled the 
quartet with a gentle but confident 
mind. All four knew that her lithe, 
athletic body with it’s soft curves 
and golden hair was the greatest 
asset in this transaction of matri- 
mony. 

There had been no dissension on 
this point, nor could there have 
been. The bureau would never have 
allowed them to be together and 
form a marriage cell had there been 
the slightest dispute. 

Many differences of opinion were 
allowable, but the four had been 
carefully screened in certain mat- 
ters of basic tastes. They liked the 
same colors, foods, styles of cloth- 
ing, video programs, sports and 
vacation activities. All were care- 
fully schooled ambiverts of roughly 
equal education. Instead of con- 
flicting, their differences of skills, 
talents and personality traits com- 
plemented each other. 

Even with all this care in select- 
ing and matching, however, the 
big test was the culmination of the 
marriage, itself — the whole pur- 
pose of this banding together. The 
unpredictable quality of the most 
stable feminine emotions made the 
choice of a mate most difficult of 
afi. 

This awareness was in all their 
minds this day, and it made them 
a little nervous. Even the argument 
that had started over the coffee 
had been faintly alarming to Sue. 
They were a team, welded together 
by the wonderful gift of telepathy, 
which was only possible through 

116 



formation of a marriage cell. The 
most complete intimacy of thought 
and feeling had been nurtured for 
a whole year before marriage was 
permissible. Sympathy, tolerance 
and sharing a common experience 
with mutual enjoyment and hap- 
piness was the keystone of the poly- 
gamous unions. Nothing must spoil 
it now. 

The delivery vault thumped, and 
the signal light flicked on. Sue 
rushed to slide up the door. 

“Orchids!” they chorused men- 
tally, and Sue noticed with satis- 
faction that June’s thought was as 
strong as the others. The lovely 
flowers were put in the cooler, the 
apartment was tidied and they 
turned to the exciting task of be- 
coming beautiful for their hand- 
some husband. 

The tiff over the coffee was for- 
gotten as they became immersed in 
sprays, powders, tints, cosmetics, 
body ornaments and the precious 
nuptial perfume. This latter, issued 
to them only yesterday when they 
signed the register and received 
the license, was now as traditionally 
exclusive to weddings as trousseaus 
had been centuries ago. 

Feminine clothing, of course, had 
long since been eliminated from 
the occasion, along with other re- 
dundancies such as waggish and 
mischievous guests, old shoes, rice 
and hectic honeymoon trips. 

The official and religious ar- 
rangements had been completed 
yesterday at the registry and the 
chapel, the union to become legal 
and effective at noon on this day. 
When Hollis Jamison walked 
through their door at twelve o’clock 
he would bring four gold rings, 
and the moment the rings were 

WINSTON MARKS 




placed on the proper fingers the 
ceremony was complete. 

Doris said, “Let’s steal just a 
tiny whiff of the perfume. I’m too 
curious to wait.” 

June and Polly were game, but 
Sue cut them off. “Not on your 
life! I used to know a chemist at 
the hormone labs where they com- 
pound this stuff, and he told me 
about it. We have things to do, and 
if what he told me is true — well, 
it’s very distracting.” 

Polly backed her up, “I hear it is 
terribly volatile. I guess we wouldn’t 
want it to wear off before Hollis 
came.” 

“Hollis!” The thought was 
June’s, and it came thin and qua- 
very. “What — do you suppose it’s 
like to be married?” 

No one answered, for there was 
no experience among them. Each 
had her own romantic idea, so 
cherished, so private that even 
within the intimacy of their clique 
it was too sacred to discuss. 

Suddenly June said, “I’m 
scared.” 

The thought had come sharply 
and unexpectedly. It was contagi- 
ous. Polly said, “Me, too.” 

“Of what?” Doris asked, “Of 
drinking strong coffee the rest of 
your lives?” 

It was a weak, nervous stab at 
humor, and Sue knew that Doris 
was as jumpy as the rest of them. 
“Steady, gals,” she said sympathet- 
ically. “It’ll be worth it. We want 
a baby, don’t we?” 

It was the right thought at the 
right time. Sue felt their minds re- 
lax, and the thought even did her 
some good. A sweet, little, round, 
pink baby — 

She let the mental picture flow 
WEDDING DAY 



out to the others, and the little 
crisis passed. 

The minutes flew, and soon it 
was five minutes to twelve. “Have 
we forgotten anything?” Sue asked. 

“The perfume!” Polly and June 
said together. 

“Hurry!” Doris said. “I think 
he’s coming.” 

The seal on the tiny vial was 
broken, one drop on each breast, 
and the rich, exotic fumes exuded 
a gentle, warm excitement that was 
entirely different from the innocent 
scents they had known. 

The door was unlocked, and now 
it opened. 

Hollis stepped in, bronzed body 
bared to the waist. 

“The flowers!” Polly wailed in- 
wardly. “We forgot the orchids — 

But Hollis Jamison didn’t notice 
the discrepancy. He advanced 
smiling from his gray eyes and 
strong mouth. Sue opened her lips 
and her fine, white teeth showed a 
welcoming smile. She was proud 
of her lovely body, and June, Polly 
and Doris shared in that pride. 

Sue held out her left hand with 
fingers outstretched. Her man came 
forward jingling the four rings in 
his right hand. He paused before 
her, drew her left hand to his lips, 
kissed the little finger and slid the 
proper ring on it, then, in order he 
kissed Sue’s other three fingers and 
banded them with the remaining 
rings, symbolic of the four separate 
feminine entities who dwelt in this 
one magnificent body. 

And with each ring he said a 
name: “June, Polly, Doris, Sue — ” 

He straightened and gazed into 
the two blue eyes. 

“I thee wed,” he said simply.

Science may some day reduce the 
function of memory to a mathema- 
tical formula involving electrical 
impulse frequencies and durations 
at certain sites in the brain. Experi- 
ments with rats have shown that the 
frequency of electrical impulses on 
the brain’s memory unit determine 
whether the memory is good or 
bad. Rats whose brains were stimu- 
lated at high frequencies were able 
to master a maze much more rapid- 
ly than those which had been sti- 
mulated at one-fourth the frequency 
rates. 

Vertical conveyor belts may replace 
the elevator cage in the future. 
Such a system was recently installed 
in a New York City garage. The 
continuous 105 foot belt has steps 
placed sixteen feet apart. When 
stopped, two steps are on each of 
the four levels of the building; four 
ready to go up and the other four 
ready to go down. The rider stand- 
ing on a step, grasps a safety han- 
dle and starts the “Man-Lift” by 
pulling a rope beside the belt. The 
rope starts a three horsepower elec- 
tric motor that turns a pulley at 
each end of the rubber and cotton 
belt. 

The first man on the moon may 
find that he’s surrounded by some 



pretty valuable crystals when he 
steps out of the spaceship. Recent 
studies have indicated that the 
specific gravity of the lunar crust 
is about equal to that of a diamond. 
Crystallized carbon could be formed 
by a fusion of the lunar surface 
caused by internal forces, such as 
modified volcanic action or meteor- 
ite bombardment. Indications point 
to the theory that the craters of 
the moon were formed by such 
actions; and strengthen the possi- 
bility of valuable crystalline forma- 
tions dotting the lunar landscape. 



The dentist may soon be drilling 
your teeth without causing any 
pain or even audible sound. A new 
drill has been introduced in tests 
which uses a machine tool designed 
for cutting metals and hard 
minerals. The device is vibrated 
electromagnetically for a distance 
of less than a thousandths of an 
inch at a speed of 29,000 times a 
second. The vibration activates the 
particles in a cutting liquid which 
do the actual work of wearing 
away the tooth material. 



The traffic problem created by 
freight delivery may be solved in 
the future by a new push-button 
device that enables a pilot to drop 
as much as twenty tons of cargo by 
pressing a button in his cockpit. A 
fully loaded cargo platform is 
dragged out of the rear of the plane 
by an extraction parachute, and 
when the platform clears the plane 
a large parachute opens and lands 
the cargo safely. Special shock ab- 
sorbers help to protect the cargo 
from impact on landing.

By next summer you may be able 
to spray your patio, picnic ground 
or campsite once — and have it rid 
of flies, mosquitoes and other in- 
sects for the entire season. U.S. 
Department of Agriculture scien- 
tists hope that chemical “extenders” 
added to present insecticides will do 
the job. Experiments have proved 
that the use of such extenders as a 
solvent for DDT has lengthened its 
effectiveness from 5 to 60 days. 

Transport planes may some day 
have detachable cabins that can 
parachute to earth if the plane 
runs into trouble. A Danish en- 
gineer has patented the model 
which will protect passengers in 
case of catastrophe. The cabin has 
a huge parachute packed on top of 
it, with small “pilot” chutes at- 
tached to the big one. The whole 
works is encased in the plane’s skin. 
In an emergency the pilot could 
close the water tight door, and 
pull an emergency lever which 
would rip the skin covering the 
cabin away. One small parachute 
would pull and slide the cabin 
away from the plane, and then the 
big chute would take over and land 
the cabin intact on land or water. 

Patients of the future may be put 
into artificial hibernation to protect 
them from traumatic shock and 
pain. The drug induced sleep was 
tried with some success in the un- 
derground hospital of the French in 



Indo China. The drop in body 
temperature, pulse rate and blood 
pressure relieve pain and relax the 
patient until he is able to stand the 
shock of drastip surgery. 

Edible corncobs may be among the 
cattle feeds of the future. Improved 
corn is already making a trend in 
this direction. Plant geneticists are 
constantly working to increase the 
pentosan chemical yield. Breaking 
the atom structure of pentosan into 
pentosan sugar is the next step on 
the agenda. When this is accom- 
plished the cob will become a valu- 
able food source. 

Window air conditioners or house- 
hold cooling systems may someday 
contain a trace of a rare element to 
freshen indoor air with invisible 
health-stimulating particles of elec- 
tricity. Experiments have shown 
that use of radioactive polonium 
210 to generate alpha particles in 
air conditioning systems creates air 
that is equally as benificent as fresh 
air without forming ions that are 
irritating to health if inhaled for 
any long periods of time. 

Summer vacation clothes may soon 
include disposable bathing suits. A 
specially processed wall paper has 
been found to have high “wet 
strength” and several feminine 
bathing suits have been made of it 
and are undergoing strenuous tests 
this year.
