Readers write — and wrong! 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

May I firstly congratulate you on the 
quality of the ^'new*' IF — and second- 
ly express you my deepest sympathy 
in your valiant struggle to placate 
that many-headed Hydra commonly 
known as your reading public. 

Seriously, considering the enormous 
variety in literary tastes, the fact that 
/ can ' personally enjoy so many 
stories in your magazine, 'issue after is- 
sue, never fails to astonish me. Nor 
can / imagine how you do it, unless 
perhaps you paper the walls of your 
office with submitted manuscripts 
and thereafter at random throw darts 
at them. In which case, though, the 
laws of chance must be rather more 
peculiar than we suspect them to be. 
(As a small example of how nearly 
impossible your task must be, perhaps 
/ may mention a letter by Mr. Scher 
in your September-October issue, 
where he writes of his general liking 
for Laumer but confesses himself 
''sick'* of Retief For my part, I would 
wholeheartedly endorse the first half 
of his statement, but thereafter would 
have to add that / enjoy the Retief 
Saga as much as anything Laumer has 
ever written. Possibly this difference 
of opinion may be simply due to the 
fact that I may be rather older than 
Mr. Scher, and hence at times like to 
lean back in my easy-chair and let my- 
self be amused by a good-natured spoof 



of human foibles. This may well be 
somewhat cowardly, but the fact is 
that when the cold wind of middle-age 
starts blowing up your spine you do 
like, now and then at least, and for a 
short while, to forget the serious side 
of life.) 

Incidentally, speaking of letters, the 
same issue of IF also carried an im- 
pressively thoughtful communi- 
cation by Mr. Carroll, considering 
the creation of*jhink-tanks** and do- 
tanks,** whereby people genuinely 
concerned about the future of our race 
might in a common effort strive to 
shape it closer to their hopes and 
dreams. 

I do not know whether the majority 
of your readers, are aware of it, but 
such a movement is currently getting 
under way, on an international basis. 
It is known as the PROMETHEUS 
PROJECT, and was initiated by Dr. 
Gerald Feinberg of Columbia Uni- 
versity some 18 months ago through a 
book of the selfsame title. ( To those of 
your readers who may have at least as 
much interest in **hard** science as in 
science fiction. Dr. Feinberg may be 
rather better known as one of today* s 
most distinguished young American 
physicists, and the propounder of the 
hypothesis that there may indeed exist 
particles faster than light, the so- 
called *Uachyons,** meaning, in Greek, 
the ** swift ones.** Startling, if not 
downright revolutionary, as the sug- 
gestion may appear to be^ it is serious- 
ly considered by theoretical physicists. 
See for example this years March is- 
sue of Science: Particles that travel 
faster than light? The article is by pro- 
fessor Roger G. Newton of Indiana 
University.)

IF 




The drive behind the Prometheus 
Project is much along the lines of A/r. 
CarrolTs arguments, and has been 
very succinctly expressed by Loren 
Eiseley (though he was not writing 
about the project at that time): ** Men, 
unknowingly, and whether for good 
or ill, appear to be making their last 
decisions about human destiny , " Com- 
menting directly on the Prometheus 
Project, Frederick Pohl described it as 
‘'the only game in town.'* 

Clearly, this is not the place to go 
into details, and / have taken enough 
of your space anyway, but may I con- 
clude by saying that I would be per- 
sonally very happy to hear from any of 
your readers in California, or for that 
matter anywhere else, who share the 
disturbing conviction that the time 
is beginning to run out for mankind. 

That ours is an age of crisis is as trite 
an observation as one can make. The 
one question which remains to be ans- 
wered, though, is whether our race 
shall prove equal to the challenge and 
enter a new day of virtually incon- 
ceivable triumphs — or fail and perish 
in the night that is falling upon all of 
us. 

May I last express the hope that 
there will be enough men and women 
of .courage and imagination suf- 
ficiently great so that the, so far, two- 
billion-years-long story of life on this 
Earth will not dismiss humanity in a 
mere footnote as an unsuccessful, if 
interesting, experiment.

Dear Sir: 

At “FAN FAIR IF* in Toronto this 
August Alexei Panshin pointed out 



that there is no real, working defini- 
tion of science fiction. He further re- 
marked that this was due to an un- 
reasoning desire to cling to Hugo 
Gernsback's definition of scientific- 
tion. At any rate the stumbling block 
was the attempt to fit the concept of 
science into the product (how much sci- 
ience does Harlan Ellison have?) The 
most part of the speech was occupied 
by pointing out how impossible this 
definition was even in the time it was 
formulated — by simply reading parts 
from various pulps of the day. 

While there are adherents to the 
science of science fiction /'Dune, The 
Land Ironcladsj for the most part / felt 
Mr. Panshin was correct. To that end 
I evolved Vogel's Law — “Science 
fiction is that branch of fiction deal- 
ing with events of extremely low 
probability in Earth's present and j or 
past, with possible events in Earth's 
future or with events in other environ- 
ments" 

Thinking it over / realized that if 
Damon Knight exists then someone 
has either beaten me to this or I am 
blind to its glaring faults. On either 
hand I would appreciate any help you 
could give me. 

Thanks 
P.H. Vogel 

I would jump you on that “low 
probability.” Probability can be low 
or high, depending on what the auth- 
or wishes to put across. Or the author 
may simply use sf to tell a story that 
could not be told in another medium 
or that can best be told as sf.

skimmed through the man-made would be glittering with thou-

guard stared at it with surprise approaching the island, 
which plunged through horror to “He’s falling through the air too 
excitement. fast, getting too hot — ” the body- 

Falling below the shuttle’s radar- guard’s snub nose and broad fore- 
blip, the spark seemed big to be a head wrinkled — “unless he’s in an 
man. It was as if his arms and legs escape bag with an ablative foot- 
were spread in the thickening air cone.” 

and he were resisting the inevitable. From the bottom of the screen 
“Is he conscious?” cried the old rose the volcano’s image. The 
man’s voice in the hut. bodyguard’s heart pounded. One 

“Maybe if he had time to close of his greatest desires was to enter 
his helmet — ” its smoldering crater and search 

The bodyguard’s boyish face be- for the forbidden weapons 




The old men were fighting an 
ancient war — while the boy 
was inventing a new one! 




“No parachute has opened,” he 
breathed as the spark faded into 
the radar-confusing smoke, “so I 
guess he wasn’t in an escape bag. 
But whatever he was in made an 
awful big blip on the screen.” His 
youthful gestures were lightning- 
quick. “Look, now the shuttle is 
following its usual landing spiral 
back toward our end of the lake, 
so it couldn’t have been the pilot 
who fell out.” 

Another gust of rain lashed 
throilgh the crevices in the crude 
stone hut. 

“It must have been Henryda- 
vid,” the old man moaned, leaning 
forward until his jagged face was 
silhouetted against the screen. His 
bodyguard looked away in em- 
barrassment at the rough stone 
wall that was weeping rain. 

The bodyguard fidgeted. To him 
the old man had long seemed a 
source of power. It was power too 
unsubstantial to be grasped. 

“The world turns — ” the old 
man murmured. “Do you think 
this is another attempt by those 
unforgiving Centralist exiles?” 

“More likely an accident in the 
shuttle,” his bodyguard said, 
“but you’d better go back to the 
village.” The young man took a 
deep breath. “I’ll paddfe out to 
meet the shuttle.” 

“No,” the old man said un- 
certainly. “No — ” 

W ITHOUT replying, the body- 
guard darted out under the 



smoky sunlight-edged clouds. He 
was uncomfortably short, but no 
one taunted him any more. He had 
wide shoulders. After his strange 
battle on that volcanic island, 
he’d been asked by the old man to 
be his bodyguard. And he had 
agreed because he was restless, 
born restless. He wanted to be 
near power. As a small boy he bad 
dreamed of becoming so big he 
filled the universe with his power. 

Now, as he looked up at the rain- 
bow-arched sky, he felt tall. He 
imagined Henrydavid, not fall- 
ing through the air but standing 
lithely again inside the shuttle 
while it clung to a synchronously 
orbiting freighter. Aluminum- 
shelled supply containers as big 
as caskets were being shoved in 
through the flexible iris that was 
its hatch. Henrydavid’s job as 
customs inspector was to open 
them immediately. 

With mixed emotions, the body- 
guard frowned. These old men 
were still trying to prevent 
Centralist propaganda from 
reaching the instaplanet via the 
shuttle. But certain young men 
here ... 

“We’ll both go out to meet it,” 
the old man said, lifting the other 
end of the heavy greenish canoe. 

The bodyguard had shaped it by 
hand-pressing layers of fila- 
mentous algae over the hull of an 
earlier canoe. When it had firmed, 
he had smeared it with fish oil and 
dutifully baked it in the sunlight. 



6 



IF 




Then he had cheated a little and 
also baked it in his village’s hydro- 
gen fusion-powered electric oven. 

The wooden paddles were im- 
ported from Earth. While the crude 
canoe sloshed out on the immense 
lake the water became lively with 
raindrops and minnows. He had 
been taught that the lake and the 
countless crater-ponds had been 
filled by the Great Rain ten years 
before he was born here. Before 
that the supersaturated air for this 
instaplanet had been produced by 
remolecularizing the rocks from 
both poles. After the air became 
sweet and the rains diminished, 
the planet had been planted with 
life. The old man and his followers 
were delivered to it as an experi- 
ment. Economic or philosophic? 
The bodyguard wondered what 
kind of world it would become. 

Now the greenish lake was 
swirling with great fish devouring 
each other in richly putrefying 
jungles of algae. But the land had 
remained barren rock, as clean 
and simple as the Decentralist 
ideal. 

In the bow of the canoe the old 
man’s slender back and arms'* 
moved his paddle with quiet grace. 
In the stern the young bodyguard 
paddled with driving force and 
steered as the huge shuttle taxied 
toward them, pushing a mustache 
of foam. 

For the bodyguard the shuttle 
carried the exciting power of 
Earth, where he wanted to go. Its 



heat-stained hull contained beauti- 
ful steel tools, bright mirrors, 
colorful beads. He had heard 
fabulous tales of Earth weapons 
with wonderful thunder-and- 
lightning power which could be 
held in a boy’s hand. He had de- 
cided the shuttle to the freighters 
was the one contact with Earth 
which must never be broken, no 
matter what the old man preached. 

“Now it’s killed someone,” the 
old man blurted as the shuttle’s 
scarred hull surged threateningly 
close to the canoe. 

But his bodyguard smiled with 
excitement. The shuttle con- 
tained power that could be 
grasped. Already concealed in his 
kirtle of woven algae was his most 
wonderful possession, a steel 
dagger smuggled from Earth. If the 
old man had known he would have 
told him to throw it overboard, be- 
cause it was a weapon, as was any 
knife more than three inches long. 

The old man would have said, 
“Weapons lead to uncontrollable 
power, to Centralism. Beware.” 

The bodyguard scowled at the 
straight old back as the canoe 
drifted alongside the shuttle. Re- 
spectful people in the villages 
still addressed the old man as Mr. 
Decentralist and some had short- 
ened this to Mr. Decent. But rest- 
less young men laughed bitterly. It 
was their fathers who had brought 
Decentralism to this instaplanet. 
The young men paced the barren 
rocks and looked out at the vol-

canic island, remembering Big 
Village before its fall. They stared 
at the forbidden island, dream- 
ing oif anotlier central city, and 
cursed the old man behind his 
back. 

T he bodyguard laid down his 
paddle and picked up his trident 
fish spear. His clumsy algal canoe 
bumped the marvelously complex 
shuttle. Without its usual hiss of 
equalizing air pressure, the shut- 
tle’s hatch opened like a camera- 
eye. Its inner iris looked rubbery. 

The pilot’s oddly blank face pro- 
truded. 

“It wasn’t my fault.” The shiny 
arm of his metalized suit flew up. 
“Your customs inspector was 
blown out like that! The valve 
popped off our emergency air tank 
and air pressure did the rest. I al- 
ways said that valve was danger- 
ous. It was poorly designed.” 

Or sabotaged, the bodyguard 
thought as he scrambled into the 
shuttle. This downtrip there seemed 
to be no unannounced passengers. 
He eyed the rows of long alumi- 
num supply containers, which they 
received from Earth in exchange 
for their little bottles of fish-gland 
extracts. Whenever he had entered 
the shuttle, it had had this fishy 
smell. 

“So the air pressure shot up in 
here,” the pilot kept explaining. 

His jowls quivered and the young 
bodyguard remembered Mr. 
Decentralist’s warning that such 



stocky or obese men were apt to be 
unfaithful to Decentralist ideals. 
It was true that the most dedicated 
Decentralists, who lived with 
austerity and simplicity, had 
naturally narrow physiques like 
Mr. Decent’s. The bodyguard’s 
wide-cheeked face grimaced, then 
scowled again. He didn’t trust the 
pilot. 

The pilot blustered: “I always 
said this loading iris is too flexi- 
ble. All that pressure bulged it out, 
blew him out.” 

“Did Henrydavid have time,” 
Mr. Decentralist murmured 
hopelessly, “to close his helmet 
visor?” 

“Don’t know. I had to hang on 
to the control panel.” The pilot 
shifted his gaze from the old man’s 
jagged face to the bodyguard’s 
blunt expression of disbelief. 

“Why,” the bodyguard chal- 
lenged, “weren’t any of these con- 
tainers blown out with him?” 

“Because he’d already inspected 
them and strapped them down 
again,” the pilot answered, “for 
landing as usual. Anyway, they’re 
too streamlined to be sucked out.” 

The bodyguard felt outsmarted. 
He quibbled. “This one isn’t 
strapped tight.” 

He knew the customs inspector 
had been a conscientious man who 
would have tightened the strap if 
he’d had time. He deliberately 
pointed his fish spear, which was 
defined as a tool, not a weapon, 
toward the pilot’s abdomen. “Did 



8 



IF 




Henrydavid have time to open all 
the containers?” 

“Yes, he always does — open 
them,” the pilot blurted and 
looked to Mr. Decent. “I feel bad 
about this.” 

“I think we’d better inspect them 
again,” the bodyguard said. 

“Not now,” replied Mr. Decent. 
“We’ve got to search for Henry- 
david.” 

The bodyguard, blinked with 
surprise. 

The pilot also stared at Mr. 
Decent. 

“We wouldn’t be able to find 
anything,” the pilot explained.. 
“The shuttle was moving so fast 
when he was blown out, his de- 
scent speed was so great that his 
body was burned in the atmos- 
phere.” 

The bodyguard looked at the 
emergency rack’s twelve cubicles 
where the glittering, heat-reflec- 
tive escape bags lay. Their “feet” 
were ablative cones for casting off 
flame as they penetrated the 
atmosphere. Their “heads” were 
two-stage parachutes. All twelve 
were still in the rack. No bags were 
missing. The bodyguard scowled, 
feeling baffled. 

“He wasn’t falling that fast,” he 
argued. “In his safety suit like 
yours his body wouldn’t — bum — 
very much.” 

“You don’t understand any- 
thing,” the pilot retorted, “about 
atmospheric entry speed. It would 
have burned him— to a crisp.” 



“You’re the expert,” Mr. Decent 
murmured to the pilot, “but I 
know we must recover his body.” 
“It was burned to ashes,” the 
pilot insisted and added too gent- 
ly: “He often said he’d want to go 
this way, with his ashes scattered 
over the lake he loved so well. 
There’s no use searching for his 
ashes. He would have wanted it this 
way.” 

E nough Ues, the bodyguard 
thought, now convinced that 
the shuttle’s speed had been re- 
duced by the time Henrydavid was 
“blown out.” The body couldn’t 
have burned to ashes. But he didn’t 
want to look for it either. He won- 
dered if this “accident” were a de- 
coy or a trap. 

But he was so angry he said, “I 
know his suit will have preserved 
most of his body. We should start 
searching near the island.” 

“Near Big Village?” the pilot 
protested. “For his ashes?” 

“Yes, in the water around the 
volcano,” the bodyguard replied, 
observing the pilot’s unhappy 
face. “Did you know we were 
watching the radar screen when it 
happened?” 

The pilot glanced at Mr. Decent. 
“It would be too dangerous for 
you — for anyone — to go over there 
in a canoe.” 

“Too slow,” the old man said 
enigmatically. And then his voice 
broke: “Henrydavid . may be 
alive — floating— browning — ”

“He means rush us over there in 
this shuttle/' the bodyguard said. 

The pilot began to protest: 
“Using a space shuttle like a ca- 
noe — “ 

The bodyguard snorted. “That’s 
what we’ve always used it for 
when no freighters have been in or- 
bit. Push the REFUEL button.” 

Gurgling, the shuttle refilled its 
water tanks. It was frequently 
employed to distribute supplies 
to other villages along the lake 
shore. 

“Now pull the FUSION lever 
only to the first mark.” The body- 
guard had ridden in the craft sev- 
eral times and knew it merely 
needed steam now, not disas- 
sociated hydrogeti and oxygen 
flaring and hurling the shuttle 
into space, where he’d only been as 
far as the freighter orbit. “We’re 
only going around Volcano Is- 
land.” 

A humming sound came from 
the shuttle’s bowels, where the 
magnetic bottle, containing its 
hydrogen fusion, produced heat. 
There was hissing as the water 
turned to steam and a roar from 
the dual-purpose thruster as the 
shuttle surged across the wide lake, 
steam billowing behind its high- 
finned tail. 

“Look at that little canoe over 
there,” the bodyguard shouted, 
surprised and suspicious because 
it seemed to be headed toward the 
forbidden island. Its paddlers 
noticed the shuttle’s course and, as 



if they had guilty consciences, 
turned back to the mainland. 

The volcanic cone squatted on 
the contorted rim of a half- 
drowned meteoric crater. The 
bodyguard knew this lone vol- 
cano had burst from a crack while 
the planet was being distorted by 
the remolecularization of rock 
from its poles. The crater had 
cooled while he had been a little 
boy. But smoke rose from a recent 
split in its flank. 

The main reason people with 
Centralist tendencies had estab- 
lished a village beside the cone, up- 
on the meteoric rim which enclosed 
the harbor, was to tap the volca- 
no’s heat for use in illegal manu^ 
facturing. They had begun making 
metal forks and spoons — and 
sharper things that the bodyguard 
secretly wished he could own. Dag- 
gers. Ever more powerful weapons. 

C ENTRALISTS were never sat- 
isfied, he thought, and now 
their village was deserted. Won- 
derful things had been thrown into 
the lake. His visualization of 
those beautiful lost weapons made 
his heart pound with desire. He 
wanted again, on this errand, to 
search the crater for unfinished 
weapons but the old man was 
along. The bodyguard glared to- 
ward the mainland. 

“There’s another canoe,” the 
bodyguard shouted harshly. “See, 
from that new village — a long dark 
canoe?” 



10 



IF 




And it didn’t seem intimidated 
by the shuttle. The bodyguard 
thought it might be headed for the 
island — or its dozen paddlers 
might simply be loyal Decentral- 
ists going fishing. He remem- 
bered that some of the Centralists 
had been dispersed along the shore 
adjacent to the new village after 
Mr. Decent had ordered the vol- 
canic island evacuated. 

While the shuttle cruised around 
it, the bodyguard watched for 
telltale gulls, but there was no sign 
of the customs inspector’s body. 

“Go into the harobr,’’ Mr. 
Decentralist *said unexpectedly. 

The bodyguard’s heart thudded 
as they entered the harbor’s rocky 
jaws. Big Village clung to the cliffs, 
deathly silent, its empty-eyed 
stone huts staring at him. He felt 
both guilt and pride and clutched 
his fish spear as if it were — a 
weapon. It was here he had shown 
he was a — man. 

A gull fluttered from the water, 
but it had been feeding on a big 
dead fish. The bodyguard knew 
the volcanic cone above Big Vil- 
lage had polluted its harbor even 
more than its air. He winced and 
felt nostalgia, remembering Big 
Village that final day when it had 
been alive with runaway girls sing- 
ing and illegal forges clanging. 

He had been a youth in the angry 
armada of paddlers from the little 
villages who had cautiously ap- 
proached this Centralist strong- 
hold. He had felt awe and envy 



when he had seen how rich and 
populous Big Village had be- 
come. There were more than two 
hundred huts. Centralists had 
crowded the stone dock. His heart 
had leaped when he had seen they 
had already manufactured three 
of the Supreme Weapons. All three 
had glinted in the sunlight. 

Now he scowled, peering down 
at the dark, deep water of the har- 
bor. 

But Mr. Decent’s voice was 
^crying: “Look up there.’’ 

A blade of sunlight illuminated a 
tiny red stain on the volcano’s 
flank, high above the dead village 
and the old man was moaning: 
“Henry, Henry—’’ 

The bodyguard realized this was 
where their falling customs in- 
spector had struck the planet like a 
meteorite. His gaze rose to the lip 
of the crater and he tried to sup- 
press his desire to enter it. This 
wasn’t a good time, although the 
rim was only a few minutes climb 
above the red splash of Henry- 
david. 

“I’ve got to go up,’’ Mr. Decent 
bleated. “Henry, oh, Henry — ’’ 

The bodyguard began to argue 
that it was forbidden to land on 
the island. “You made the rule. 
Anyway this may be a trap.’’ 

But the distraught old man or- 
dered the pilot to bring the shuttle 
alongside the algae-shrouded 
stone dock. 

“That canoe may get here 
soon,’’ the bodyguard warned. 



TO GRAB POWER

“They may be coming because 
they saw him fall.” 

But there was no use arguing 
with the old man and, unless the 
wind changed so that the paddlers 
could open their sailing um- 
brellas, the bodyguard knew the 
canoe couldn’t get here for at least 
an hour. He started to follow the 
old man on to the dock. His own 
desire rose. 

He slipped. Algae had grown 
where there had been bfood, he re- 
alized, and he recovered his^ 
natural alertness. He jumped back 
aboard the shuttle before it could 
escape. His fish spear backed the 
pilot toward one of the alumi- 
num containers. 

“Open it. Now dump out those 
pamphlets. Pamphlets? Anyway 
get in. You won’t smother. The lid 
doesn’t fit that well.” He tightened 
the straps. “Don’t go away,” he 
said, clambering out on the shut- 
tle’s deck. He made it fast to a 
stone cleat on the dock. 

H e ran after the old man, 
through the crumbling village 
of memories. When the armada 
had approached it Big Village 
had illegally contained at least a 
thousand people, although the 
maximum permissible size for a 
community on this instaplanet 
was a hundred. It was a fabulous 
place, and young runaways had 
flocked to it. He remembered 
smiling with excitement rather 
than fear, even when he had seen its 



three supreme weapons gleaming. 

Mr. Decent had boldly landed on 
the dock to negotiate or accuse. 

“You’ve already taken away the 
nuc-boxes from five villages, de- 
priving them of electricity.” 

“You old hypocrite,” the mayor 
of the Big Village had retorted. 
“You complain about us taking 
their electricity, but you’ve been 
urging them to decentralize into 
tens — or families to live without 
electricity. Look, we have so many 
people here who need it, we ought 
to have ten electric-boxes, not five. 
Listen, Earth sends a box to this 
planet for each hundred people, so 
we have the right to proportional 
allocation of electric power. We 
ought to have ten boxes.” 

“No. You’re rebuilding all the 
confusion and greed we tried to 
leave behind on Earth,” the old 
man had shouted. “You’re even 
manufacturing inhuman weapons.” 
All three glinted sharply in: the 
sunlight. 

Mr. Decentralist had rashly 
grabbed at one. When he had fall- 
en down during the scuffle, his 
shrill Decentralists had begun 
scrambling from their canoes to 
the dock, thrusting out their fish- 
ing spears like weapons. 

“Defense,” the mayor had yelled 
over his shoulder and the three 
holders of the supreme weapons 
had waddled forward, deflecting 
fish-spears with their aluminum 
shields and raising their beautiful 
steel weapons.

IF 




As their blades flashed in the 
sunlight the future bodyguard’s 
heart had pounded with desire 
instead of fear even as the central- 
ists attacked. 

They struck off hands and arms 
and heads in a frantic display of 
power. Instead of fleeing, he had 
circled. ' A Centralist had slipped 
on the blood and fallen, his su- 
preme weapon clanging against 
the stones. 

The future bodyguard had 
rushed forward and wrested away 
the sword. 

Now it’s mine, he had thought 
excitedly, gripping its hilt. 

The second swordsman had 
waddled toward him. He had 
dodged the thrust. These three su- 
preme weapons were so valuable 
that thjy had been carried by three 
of the most important men in Big 
Village, fat,jmiddle-aged men. 

With youthful quickness the 
bodyguard-to-be had swung his 
great blade back and forth. It had 
Struck his opponent’s neck. Now 
that he had the knack of it the 
bodyguard-to-^ had rushed at the 
third middle-aged man. Around 
him the excited Decentralists had 
attacked with their fish spears. 
Blood sprayed. 

The Big Villagers had scattered, 
ending the strangely abrupt battle 
and beginning the problem of 
what to do with so many defeated 
people who were still Centralists 
at heart. 

Now, as the bodyguard ran up- 



ward through the empty village 
after the old man, he thought the 
wind might be changing. The long 
canoe could be approaching 
rapidly. It might be filled with 
Centralist renegades, returning. 

On the side of the volcano he saw 
Mr. Decent kneel in the great red 
splash. The old man seemed to be 
murmuring to a fragment of 
Henrydavid’s safetysuit. He was 
picking it up. 

The bodyguard climbed past, 
hurrying to reach the top to spot 
the canoe over there — and for an- 
other reason. 

F rom the rim of the volcano he 
looked out over the immense 
wind-wrinkled lake and the lonely 
land beyond, glittering with count- 
less crater-ponds, where the old 
man wanted people to spread out 
in smaller groups in an ever simpler 
way of life. 

The bodyguard smiled and 
shook his head. The long dark 
canoe was still a long way off. 
Whether it contained faithful 
Decentralist fishermen or un- 
repentant Centralist rebels, they 
were still paddling against the 
wind. His heart leaped. He might 
have time to search the crater. 

He peered down into the darkly 
jumbled funnel and his heart 
pounded as it had when he had 
seized the sword in the Battle of 
Big Village. The greatest disap- 
pointment of his life had come 
after the fighting, when the old 



TO GRAB POWER 



13 




man had honored him by choos- 
ing him as his new bodyguard and 
then toid him to throw all three 
swords into the lake. 

The bodyguard had secretly re- 
turned later and dredged for them, 
cursing and crying because he 
had stupidly thrown away their 
power. 

No unfinished swords had been 
found in Big Village and he thought 
the illegal weapons forge might 
have been concealed in this cra- 
ter. As he descended, his snub nose 
wrinkled at the sulphurous 
strench. He searched under lava 
ledges for even an unfinished 
-swdrd, which could give him power 
to— 

Mis eyes widened. At the 
bottom, beside a vertical split 
where steaming rainwater drained 
out of the crater, he saw some- 
thing white and rumpled. He 
clutched his fish spear like a wea- 
pon and clambered down, sending 
rocks rattling. 

His eyes widened. The whiteness 
was a folded parachute partial- 
ly covering an escape bag. Except 
for its ablative foot cone, the bag 
lay flat.' It was a different model 
from the twelve in the shuttle. He 
could see it was empty. No one was 
on the nearby rocks. The bag was 
open. He thought the inspector 
must have fallen out — but why 
would he have been in an escape 
bag descending into the crater? 

Anyone peering through the 
bag’s periscope could have 



steered its chute toward the vol- 
cano. Any man could have been 
breathing from its oxygen tank. 
The bodyguard didn’t think 
Henrydavid would have had a rea- 
son to ride down in an escape bag. 

He clutched his spear and looked 
around quickly, but no one was 
crouching in ambush among the 
rocks. 

‘‘Don’t move,” a hoarse voice 
said and the parachute cloth 
squirmed. A swollen-faced, mid- 
dle-aged man had been lying mo- 
tionless underneath it. A gleaming 
metal rod with a round hole in its 
end was pointing out at the body- 
guard. The man sat up. “Throw 
away your spear — that’s right.” 

The bodyguard’s heart was again 
drumming with excitement -rath- 
er than fear as he stared at tHis ab- 
solutely ultimate weapon which 
could change life on his instaplan- 
et. Its barrel and folding stock were 
gleaming with the promise of pow- 
er. One of the man’s hands gripped 
its long bullet clip. The other en- 
closed its trigger mechanism. The 
bodyguard shivered with desire be- 
cause he wanted the weapon more 
than anything in the universe. 

“Stop smiling,” the man’s voice 
shrilled as if he were in great pain. 
“Who are you?” 

“A fisherman,” the bodyguard 
finally answered, surprised the 
man hadn’t recognized him from 
the Battle of Big Village or its af- 
termath. “I just climbed here 
to—” 



14 



IF 




“Don’t move. I’ll shoot.” The 
parachutist’s blotchy face grimac- 
ed, smiled, then looked disappoint- 
ed. “Don’t you know who I am?” 

“No,” the bodyguard lied, his 
thoughts racing between the 
future and the past. 

He began to glimpse the brilliant 
scheme by which this exiled mayor 
of Big Village had hoped to re- 
enter the instaplanet undetect- 
ed. The falling spark on the radar 
screen — anyone familiar with the 
operation of the shuttle would 
have reasoned it to be the Cus- 
toms Inspector falling all alone 
because of some accident? But 
Henrydavid had not fallen alone. 

The pilot had been part of the 
conspiracy, the fat-faced pilot — 
The bodyguard imagined the scene 
inside the shuttle, among the con- 
tainers from the freighter. The 
pilot must have struck Henrydavid 
on the head. Then this blotchy- 
faced man had emerged from a 
container and dragged out his spe- 
cial escape bag from another. He 
would have tied Henrydavid’s 
body to the outside of this bag, us- 
ing one of its parachute control 
lines and a slip-knot. After arrang- 
ing the bag against the hatch iris 
the Centralist ex-mayor must 
have sealed himself inside it and 
waited. 

The bodyguard’s eyes widened in 
admiration. When the shuttle 
had approached the smoke from 
the volcanic island the pilot must 



have knocked the valve off the re- 
serve air tank. The sudden in- 
crease in air pressure had blown 
the flexible iris outward and the 
escape bag had hurtled into space, 
falling diagonally toward the is- 
land and appearing on their radar 
screen as a single spark. No won- 
der it had seemed surprisingly 
large to represent one man. 

The bodyguard smiled at this 
fabulous ex-mayor who must 
have yanked the extra control line 
at the last moment, freeing him- 
self from the weight of Henry- 
david’s body as the escape bag van- 
ished into the radar-confusing 
smoke. He had deployed the 
drogue chute. After his main chute 
opened, he had skillfully steered it 
to his island, disappearing into 
the volcanic crater. 

The bodyguard’s smile became 
a grin because, in landing down 
here, the man seemed to have 
broken his leg. 

“Let me help you — to climb out 
of here.” 

“Keep away.” 

The gun barrel rose. The Cen- 
tralist’s thick body shifted and his 
face contorted in pain. His left leg 
had an unusual bend in it. 

T he bodyguard nodded obedi- 
ently, waiting his chance. His 
gaze devoured the beautiful gun, 
the first he had ever seen except in 
smuggled pictures. 

“Is it called a sub-machine 
gun?” 



TO GRAB POWER

“You don’t even know who I 
am,’’ the middle-aged man ex- 
claimed angrily. “You don’t know 
what to do.’’ 

The bodyguard considered the 
dagger concealed in his kirtle and 
^said, “Let me help or you’ll die 
down here.’’ 

He thought whipping out his 
dagger would take too long. He’d 
better grab at the gun. 

“Look, there’s blood leaking 
where you opened that leg-zip on 
your suit. A compound fracture?’’ 
“Stay back,’’ the man rasped. “I 
don’t need you. Others are coming 
to this island to meet me.’’ 

“In canoes?’’ The bodyguard 
feigned surprise. He doubted the 
man could have seen that long 
canoe through his periscope while 
his bag was descending. “There 
aren’t any canoes out there — ex- 
cept mine. So you need my help. 
I’ve always wanted the good 
things they have on Earth. I wish 
I’d been born there — with all the 
autocars and television boxes, 
and great cities — ’’ 

While he tried to sound like a 
Centralist, his voice grew so con- 
vincing that what he said became 
true. He realized how much he 
wanted what the Centralists 
wanted, and he watched that beau- 
tiful gun barrel lowering as the 
parachutist’s arms relaxed. In a lit- 
tle while he would have an oppor- 
tunity to grab this wonderful sub- 
machinegun, the ultimate weapon 
on the instaplanet. 



Rocks rattled behind him. He 
whirled. Up there a half-naked, 
scrawny figure was clambering 
down from the rim. 

“Who’s that?’’ the parachutist 
hissed. 

“Another fisherman,’’ the body- 
guard lied hopelessly. 

“Wave to him to come down.’’ 
Evidently the Centralist thought 
he might need two to carry him up. 

“He already is coming,’’ the 
bodyguard gritted, wishing that 
old man would see the gun and run. 
Mr. Decent had upset his plan be- 
fore he could execute it. He had 
intended to hide the sub-machine- 
gun after taking care of the para- 
chutist — and to return for it later. 
But Mr. Decent must $ee the gun 
by now and eventu^y he would 
tell his bodyguard drop it into 
the lake. The bodyguard scowled. 

The old man was scrambling 
down clutching a Woody scrap of 
cloth as if it were all that was left of 
Henrydavid. [ 

“You!’’ 

“You! Don’t come any closer.’’ 
The parachutist’s aifli shifted be- 
tween the bodyguard and the old 
Decentralist. “I’ll shoot you, you 
old hypocrite.’’ 

“You agreed not to return,’’ Mr. 
Decent wheezed as the wind 
wailed above the crater. “Why are 
you here?’’ 

High above the old man’s jagged 
face volcanic smoke writhed 
across the sky and the bodyguard 
realized the wind had changed. In

TO GRAB POWER 




their long canoe the fishermen 
who might be Centralists would 
be opening their sailing umbrel- 
las. Their dark canoe would be 
surging toward the island. The 
bodyguard’s young, wide, muscu- 
lar body felt as if it were swelling. 
He couldn’t wait much longer. 
While he watched for a chance to 
leap at the gun, he felt as strong 
and quick as when he had dodged 
those sword thrusts. He supposed 
a bullet wouldn’t be much faster 
than a sword and it was such a lit- 
tle thing. The round eye of the 
gun muzzle stared at him. 

“Move back,” the parachutist 
hissed. “Closer to Mr. — Decen- 
tralist.” 

The bodyguard smiled and didn’t 
move, silently willing Mr. De- 
cent not to remark that a long ca- 
noe was coming. The parachutist 
would assume it carried the Cen- 
tralist activists who were sup- 
posed to meet him. He would feel 
free to squeeze the trigger, shoot- 
ing the old man. But the body- 
guard couldn’t conceive of him- 
self being killed and leaned to- 
ward the Centralist leader, wait- 
ing for his opportunity. 

“You can’t become mayor of an 
empty village,” Mr. Decent’s 
voice bargained. “I let you go be- 
fore. I’ll let you go back to Earth 
again.” 

“Hypocrite!” the ex-mayor 
cried. “You talked of peace and in- 
dividual freedom but led the at- 
tack on Big Village. It would have 



been kinder if you’d executed me 
then. This is my island. Where are 
my people now?” 

“Dispersed,” the old man 
retorted. “Enjoying pure and 
simple lives again.” 

“He’s a fanatic,” the Centralist 
hissed frantically to the body- 
guard, “a fanatic old man. He 
thinks a hundred people are too 
many for a village. He wants to 
disperse families, one to a 
pond — and after that what?” 
“Transcendant freedom,” the 
old man replied “to contemplate.” 
“Freedom to isolate yourself be- 
side a pond,” the Centralist cried, 
“on a bare planet and think about 
what? You hypocrite, already in 
your little villages there’s no free- 
dom for young people to do what 
they want to do, which is to get to- 
gether and — ” 

“They’re growing up unspoiled.” 
Mr. Decent look^ to his young 
bodyguard, who realized that both 
of them, the old man and the mid- 
dle-aged ntan, the Decentralist 
and the Centralist^ were speaking 
to him rather than to each other. , ^ 
“This old man is trying to be 
mental jailer for you young peo- 
ple. Listen!” The parachutist ob- 
viously wanted his help and al- 
legiance. “Listen — ” 

E ach seemed to be trying to 
win him, to use him, as if he 
represented all of the young peo- 
ple on the planet, its future. 

The Centralist insisted: “It’s 



IF 



17 




this old man's fault your insta- 
planet is tied to an unfair 
economic plan. That damned plan 
for economic decentralization 
was written by bureaucrats on 
Earth for the benefit of Earth. 
That’s why we weren’t allowed to 
manufacture anything. That’s 
why villages were limited to a hun- 
dred people. In that inhuman 
plan all we’re supposed to do is 
catch Fish and send their glandular 
extracts to Earth. Listen, unless 
we centralize, our instaplanets’ 
unfavorable balance of trade will 
keep us poor colonial slaves.” 

“Who needs trade?” the old man 
retorted. “Good Decentralists are 
learning to do without Earth’s 
corrupting products. We have 
fish and health-giving , algae. We 
can weave kirtles and build stone 
shelters. We can become free of 
Earth trash. We don’t need that ac- 
cursed shuttle any more. We don’t 
have to rely on Earth. 

“That’s right,” the Centralist in- 
terrupted and smiled at the young 
man. “When we Jiave a great in- 
dustrial city we won’t have to rely 
as much on Earth. We can en- 
joy—” 

“—polluting our lives!’’ the 
Decentralist shouted. “We came 
here to escape evil and noise and 
greed. That’s why we had to accept 
that Economic Plan, so Earth 
would pay our transportation 
here.” 

The parachiftist nodded and 
stared at the young man. “Yes, af- 



ter the Bureau of Colonization 
created air and water on this planet 
it wrote our unfairly limited Ec- 
onomic Plan so we’d always be de- 
pendent on them.” He grimaced 
and hissed with pain, trying to 
move his leg. “It contradicted our 
Constitution,” he added bitterly. 

“You signed the Plan though,” 
the old man said. 

“So did you — and I was younger 
than you and innocent then,” the 
middle-aged parachutist re- 
torted. “You hypocrite! You 
signed the Economic Plan — but 
in your own way you’re trying to 
be free of it, too. You’ve been tell- 
ing villagers to forget their ma- 
terial needs, to stop sending fish 
extracts to Earth. You claim we’ll 
be free of Earth your way if we’ll 
scatter from this lake to isolated 
ponds. To philosophic idiocy. But 
most of us want the freedom to 
build a great city. We’ll have our 
own independent industries. 
That’s the way to be free of Earth.” 

The Centralist looked hopefully 
at the young man, who was smiling 
at the sub-machinegun. 

The bodyguard wished the 
Decentralists and Centralists could 
agree beyond the need for inde- 
pendence from Earth. He wished 
each group would simply follow its 
own desires. What he wanted was 
the gun. 

“Keep back,” rasped the para- 
chutist, aiming between them. 

“Give up,’’ the old man 
demanded. “Give up the gun.” 



18 



IF 




“Hypocrite!” the Centralist 
cried. “It was you who used force 
against us. First you old hypocrites 
tore out the last page of our Consti- 
tution, so you could feel free to at- 
tack us. You tore out the right to 
assemble, to choose a way of life, 
to build a city. All that was in our 
Constitution until you old men 
became so terrified you tore it 
out. You stole freedom from our 
young people.” He looked at the 
young man. “Our Constitution 
was written on Earth by experts 
and was above the Economic 
Plan. Ask him what happened to 
its last page.” 

The young bodyguard had been 
vaguely aware that there was a 
weathered copy of the Constitu- 
tion on display in his village, but 
he had never gotten around, to 
reading it. He shrugged. 

“The majority of our elders in all 
the villages voted to remove the 
last page,” Mr. Decent wheezed, 
“because it was necessary to de- 
fend our villages from you — ” 

“Hypocrite! That wasn’t the 
reason,” the Centralist gasped. 

“It was,” Mr. Decent retorted. 
“We can’t permit violations of De- 
centralism which would seduce 
our young people. We can’t per- 
mit corruptions such as Big Vil- 
lage if our way of life is to survive. 
You criminal, you murderer — ” 
the old man pointed a finger red 
with the blood of his customs in- 
spector — “you' murdered Henry- 
david, didn’t you?” 



The old man began to shiver 
violently with scrawny rage. The 
bodyguard expected him to leap 
at the Centralist. Now he hoped 
the parachutist would shoot Mr. 
Decent — that instant would be his 
opportunity to grab the gun, all 
its power! 

The young bodyguard’s face 
hardened. The parachutist raised 
the gun. 

“Give it to me,” The old man 
stepped toward the ex-mayor and 
reached out his hand for the sub- 
machinegun as if he were simply 
dealing with another young De- 
centralist villager. “I say, give it 
to me!” 

As the gunman’s own tendons 
tightened, the bodyguard saw he 
was going to shoot. He was going 
to kill Mr. Decentralist. The act 
was no longer in his imagina- 
tion — it was going to be real. The 
bodyguard lunged faster than 
thought in a conditioned reflex 
called duty and his hand grabbed 
the submachinegun’s barrel; 
yanking it aside as it roared. It 
was hammering and burning, 
slapping his chest so hard he fell 
backward and the rocks seemed 
soft. 

He hadn’t expected this. He had 
wanted the old man — the old 
order — to die. But he had saved 
Mr. Decent’s life. 

H e clung to the gun, to its 
warmly quiet smoothness. As 
he sat up he was amazed at how

much his chest hurt when he 
coughed. Blood was splattering 
all over the gleaming mechan- 
ism. Frantically he tried to wipe it 
off. He wanted to say something. 

‘*You’ve shot him,” Mr. 
Decent’s distant voice was yelling 
at someone. “He’s dying.” 

The bodyguard couldn’t remem- 
ber having shot anyone. He clung 
to the gun, knowing he hadn’t 
fired it yet, but to do so was what 
he wanted more than anything in 
the world. His hand searched along 
its slipperiness for the trigger. 
He wanted to feel its power blast- 
ing — to release all his strength. He 
had the ultimate weapon. 

In the dizzily fluctuating light 
and darkness he became aware 
that the Centralist was crawling 
toward him, dragging a broken 
leg, reaching out to retrieve the 
gun. 

“Shoot, shoot,” the old man’s 
voice was shouting. 

The bodyguard needed to pull 
the trigger, but as his numbed 
fingers groped for it he saw Mr. 
Decentralist’s angular shadow 
hurl itself upon the Centralist. 
They were struggling on the rocks. 
Decentralist and Centralist indis- 
tinguishable in this crazy dark- 
ness in his head. As if he were go- 
ing blind, the bodyguard peered 
out, trying to see which of his 
enemies was on top. 

If he shot the Centralist, he knew 
Mr. Decent would thank him then 
and later tell him to drop this won- 



derful sub-machinegun into the 
lake where the swords had been 
lost. 

The bodyguard’s mind rebelled 
dimly while they thrashed about in 
the crater. If he shot Mr. Decent 
instead — he wondered if the 
grateful parachutist would let 
him keep the gun? Not for long. In 
his veins he felt the dark canoe ap- 
proaching. Even if he joined them, 
he knew the Centralists would 
sieze the gun because it was the 
ultimate power. 

“Shoot, shoot — ” a strange, 
hoarse voice was shouting. 

In his darkness he felt his power 
swelling with realization that he 
could 3hoot both of them while 
they struggled, entwined. His 
finger began to curl around the 
trigger while his imagination 
hurried to strip off the parachut- 
ist’s safety suit. Its smoothly 
metallized cloth became a per- 
fect fit for him, shiny and unsul- 
lied by the bullet holes in his body. 
He pushed the Centralist’s 
bloody, bullet-riddled body under 
a ledge and it vanished as if from a 
dream. 

In that overlapping instant all 
the men from the dark canoe stood 
around the volcano’s rim like teeth 
and he was gurgling: “Come down. 
We will build a great city.” They 
became towers around his harbor. 
He led them to the mainland, cov- 
ering the whole instaplanet with 
his city of power. “That’s not all I 
want—” 



20 



IF 




His finger was squeezing the 
slippery metal hull of the shuttle 
and it roared deafeningly, cap- 
turing the freighters in orbit. 
When his glittering armada 
landed on Earth, he gripped the hot 
steel microphone and gurgled 
sensuously. His great fleet was 
rising from all over his Earth. With 
his. finger rigidly contracted on 
the vibrant trigger, he sprayed his 
power outward through the dark- 
ness of the Universe. 

T ’HE old man kneeled in per- 
plexed horror beside his body- 
guard. The canoemen clambered 
down from the rim. Their thick 
faces glanced from the corpse of 
the parachutist, whose forehead 
had been crushed, as if by a bru- 
tal caveman, by Mr. Decentra- 
list’s jagged rock — to the young 
bodyguard, who lay on his back, 
clutching the sub-machine gun. 

His chest had been riddled by 
bullets during that Pavlovian in- 
stant when he had yanked the gun 
away from the parachutist by its 
barrel and saved the old man. He 
had fallen backward with it, 
coughing and writhing, splatter- 
ing the rocks with his blood, while 
his numbing hands searched its 
slippery steel. His forefinger still 
gripped the trigger of the emptied 
sub-machinegun. His eyes— 

The most massive of the fisher- 
men wrenched the gun away, 
grunting excitedly. “We seen a 
parachute come down,’’ he told 



Mr. Decent. “We come. We broke 
your rule again, but we landed on 
this island. Good thing. This is 
a — gun!’’ 

The old man looked up along the 
fisherman’s bulky torso to his 
greedily grinning face. Plainly 
this was not a thoughtful man who 
would be satisfied with the soli- 
tude and austerity of hiw own 
Walden Pond. 

“Where are the rest of the 
bullets?” the big fisherman 
croaked while the other thick-bod- 
ied men crowded around. 

The old man looked down past 
his own thin fingers, stained with 
blood, to the splay feet and heavy 
legs of these fishermen, who still 
must consider themselves De- 
centralists. But he felt a hot wind 
whirling in the crater; as if from 
the future, heard their hoarse 
voices arguing as they struggled 
for the gun. 

“Where are the bullets?” 

In the hot crater Mr. Decentra- 
list felt his life-long beliefs shrivel- 
ing. He became terrified that this 
barren instaplanet had defeated his 
ideals and dreams. A hoarse-voiced 
generation of greedy Centralists 
seemed as close as his death. 

The unexplainable bullet- wound 
in his side bled. After this — whom 
could he trust? 

Bending over his young 
bodyguard’s inscrutably dead face, 
the old man wept. 

He felt his power draining away.

I 

F OUR YEAR-OLD CAESAR 
was wheeled out of the opera- 
ting room and returned to his crib 
in Orphanage 309. Time: 7:50 
hours in the year 1104 Deneb Im- 
plant Time. A bulky white band- 
age covered his face at eye level. 
He slept soundly for most of the 
rest of the day — his red-headed, 
freckled-face form half buried in 
the soft pillow and blankets. Toys 
watched. Although he was too 
young to understand — he had just 
lost his left eye. 

Awakening late in the evening, 
he found that his only visual con- 
tact with the world was through a 
pinhole in a shield over his right 
eye. Puzzled, he found that if he 
moved his gaze from that pinhole 
he saw only blackness and the 
movement twinged the raw ocular 
muscles in the left socket. Turning 
carefully at neck and waist, he 
surveyed his crib — chamois dog, 
tattered pillow and red ball. As he 
found each item he pulled it into his 
lap, cradling it there. They were his 
world. Nothing was missing. 
Nothing, that is, except the eye. 

The Healer, solemn and gray- 
ing, visited him daily. Impersonal 
younger parameds tended to his 
essential needs. He had no other 
visitors. He rolled his ball back and 
forth in the crib and talked to his 
dog. 

Several weeks later the bandage 
was replaced by a small, black 



patch. The pin-holed shield was 
removed. 

‘*You can open your eye. Little 
Caesar. I’ve dimmed the window,” 
said the paramed as he gathered 
up the tangle of bandages. 

Caesar screwed up his freckled 
face and peeked around his room. 
The lunch tray had been brought in 
and the aroma caught his atten- 
tion. 

*‘May I go outside and play?” 
asked Caesar. 

“Check with Library after 
you’ve eaten,” was the paramed’s 
curt reply. He left Caesar to his 
tray. 

Dumping all the crisp croutons 
into the thyme-flavored con- 
somme, Caesar munched rapidly. 
Then, wiping his mouth on his 
sleeve, he picked up his red ball and 
started out into the corridor. 
Fingering the wall for stability, he 
made his way into the Library and 
stood before the large mahogany 
desk. Healer was seated in the soft 
desk chair and was speaking in a 
soft monotone. Caesar waited. As 
the Healer finished, he stood up 
and smiled at Caesar. 

“Please be seated, Caesar,” said 
Library' as Healer went out. Caesar 
placed his ball into the chair’s 
pillowy recesses and climbed up 
onto the seat. 

“And how do we feel today?” 
asked Library. 

“Okay, I guess,” said Caesar. 
“May I go out and play?” 

Library paused. Its class IX 



24 



IF 




brain processed the request 
against Caesar’s ambulatory sta- 
tus. 

It answered, “Healer says that 
you may go outside today — for 
walking. You may not run, jump 
or otherwise engage in strenuous 
activity. Understand?” 

A distracting man punctuated 
each sentence. 

“Yes, Library,” said Caesar. He 
climbed down, picked up his ball 
and started for the sunlit doorway. 
Library returned to its inner 
ruminations — menu planning and 
inventory checking. 



C AESAR squinted about the 
playground. Deneb stood 
straight up. A class VII gardener 
trimmed and mowed, filling the air 
with the odor of green cytoplasm. 
Restless dust occasionally jumped 
in a breeze. Several yards away 
one of the older boys — Arnold — 
leaned idly on a pair of bright 
metal crutches and drew lines in 
the yellow-ocher dust with the rub- 
ber heel of his walking cast. He 
was one of the Long Runners and 
was mending a torn heel cord. 
When he saw Caesar he waved 
cheerily. 

Caesar gave his ball an 
experimental toss — holding his 
head cocked to center it in his 
single visual field. The ball dis- 
obeyed him and rolled past Arnold. 
Holding both crutches in his left 
hand, Arnold balanced on his 



good foot and scooped up the ball. 

“Catch.” 

Caesar watched its bouncing 
approach. It was raising little 
white puffs of dust as it came. He 
sidled into its path and closed his 
hands over — nothing. The ball 
avoided his hands and rolled up 
onto the freshly cut grass. 

“Come on. One-eye. You can do 
better’n that,” shouted Arnold. 

Caesar picked up the ball. Set- 
ting his jaw, he returned to face 
Arnold. He threw with great 
concentration but the ball went 
wide again. Arnold shrugged, got a 
good grip on his crutches and 
started hobbling after it. Caesar 
didn’t play ball very long that day. 

Although he was saddened by 
the ball’s sudden contrariness, he 
still let it stay in his crib at night. 
He didn’t understand the role that 
binocular vision played in depth 
perception. All he knew was that 
he had lost a friend in his ball. 

The left socket granulated 
smoothly and he was fitted with a 
glassy prosthesis. It was heavy, and 
moving it around was good 
exercise for the nubbins of ocular 
muscle that remained under the 
scar. Although it moved sluggishly 
and lacked some of the sparkle of 
his good eye, it did fill out the space 
under the lid cosmetically. 
Actually, Little Caesar was less 
concerned about his lost eye than 
about his lost ability to play ball. 
Learning to throw and catch had 
been sort of a milestone in his 



THE BEAST OF 309 



25 




musculo-skeletal development — 
and now it was gone. 

One evening, after an unusually 
disappointing day on the play- 
ground, he climbed up onto 
Library’s soft seat and asked: 
“Why can’t I play ball any more?” 

“Everyone is different,” 
answered the desk. “Some chil- 
dren play team games — like ball. 
Others must go it alone. Try the 
Long Run, Caesar. Trade your ball 
for a canteen.” 

That night Caesar climbed into 
his crib with his pillow, toy dog and 
the canteen. He missed his ball at 
first, but the canteen — shaped like 
a flattened ball — had a resilient, 
fiber outer cover. It wasn’t 
uncomfortable,-^ He’d adjust to 
sleeping with it. 

T he canteen served him well. It 
carried the 0.7 liters of water 
which enabled him to make the 
Long Run comfortably. The 
course — an invigorating six miles 
through the wooded hills behind 
the Orphanage — attracted him im- 
mediately. His canteen symbolized 
maturity. Six months later he had 
won status in his peer group with 
his comfortable ten-minute-mile 
pace. Older boys often saved their 
deserts for him if he would set the 
pace for their training runs. Dur- 
ing his remaining years at Orphan- 
age 309 he was known as the wan- 
dering pacemaker. 

As adolescence approached, 
Caesar discovered that he couldn’t 



spend all of his life in the solitude 
of running. His missing eye caused 
some anxiety which was undirec- 
ted, until he transformed it into 
simple hatred. Hatred for the bo- 
gyman whom the older boys had 
blamed for his loss. At 309 the 
children explained away all unex- 
pected tragedies with this concept 
of an unseen, evil demon — The 
Beast. The Beast roamed their 
nightmares and filled their con- 
versation. 

Library, inspired by its paternal 
circuits, called Caesar in. “There is 
no Beast,” it counseled. “You have 
to face the real world, Caesar. For- 
get childhood fantasy. Your eye 
must have been removed for a very 
good reason. It probably was 
diseased or contained a tumor like 
a melanoma or retinoblastoma. It 
was done to save your life, 
undoubtedly. A bogyman can’t 
just slip in here and perforrn a 
clandestine enucleation. 

“You’ll be graduating soon. I’ve 
placed you in competition for 
Starship Academy. Effort may win 
you a ship of your own. Every 
quantum of mental energy will be 
needed. You’ll have none to spar^ 
on fantasy.” 

“Starship Academy?” said 
Caesar, stunned. 

“And don’t worry about the 
expense. You have been left a 
generous lega 9 y for education,” 
added Library. 

“From my parents?” asked 
Caesar awkwardly. 



26 



IF 




Library winced his telltales. 
“We never mention that here at 
Three-o-nine. It is sufficient to 
realize that they existed once — out 
of biological necessity — but for us 
they exist no more. They have left 
you with good genes and an 
adequate legacy. That is all you 
need know.” 

Library closed the subject and its « 
telltales went from a cautious 
amber-two to a more relaxed 
green. Caeser stood up — a bigger 
Caesar now — with lean limbs and a 
few red chin whiskers. Testos- 
terone had begun to alter his 
physiology and psyche. His larger 
larynx resonated more deeply; pro- 
tein and calcium had been added to 
his frame. Deep, warm reflexes had 
changed his attitude toward fe- 
males. 

S tarship Academy placed 
Caesar in tough intellectual 
competition. He likened it to the 
long run — going it alone mentally 
— grinding his way through theory, 
practice and new concepts. 

The nagging Beast dwelled in the 
back of his subconscious and 
drained his metal energy. One day 
it came abruptly to the surface as 
he was studying an optic play- 
back in exobiology. The subject 
was a dark, hairy arachnoid. 
Sensory probes had recorded its 
activities on one of the newly 
colonized planets about four 
parsecs from Deneb. Neglecting 
the scale, Caesar assumed he was 

THE BEAST OF 309 



watching a little spider rearrang- 
ing its wet, white eggs in its nest. 
The focus was indistinct. He 
imagined he was watching the 
Beast running off with his eye. Or 
was it his ball? Shuddering, as the 
scale became obvious, he realized 
why the new colonies on the 
arachnoid's planet were having 
such a difficult time getting estab- 
lished. The arachnoid was huge and 
the moist objects it was carrying 
were skulls — human skulls. 

Caesar remained frozen to the 
viewer, trying to gather his wits. 
The recording ended and there 
followed the nice relaxing view of 
an anatomy drawing. The internal 
organs of the alien spider-like 
creature were diagramed in color, 
with reassuring labels. 

The academy years were not 
easy ones for Caesar, but he 
learned his lessons well and won his 
spaceship — Jen-B — a cybernette 
with a very female facade. His 
physiological parameters were 
wired into her sensors. One of her 
first observations was that he was 
too concerned about his missing 
eye. She understood it as: ‘"an 
unmated male with an infirmity — ” 
and suggested that he try the Organ 
Banks for a replacement. 

Caesar objected: “Organ Banks 
do not carry whole eyes. Eyes are 
extensions of the Central Nervous 
System, and CNS tissue just isn’t 
banked. You’re thinking of 
corneas.” 

Jen-B checked her memory 



27 




bank. “No — I’m certain that eyes 
can be replaced — whole eyes. The 
technique is called Genetic 
Carbon Copying. It is complex 
and expensive. But I’ll be tied up 
for a while getting our assignment. 
Why don’t you check with the local 
O.B. office — ask for GCC.’’ 

She orbited Caesar down in the 
scooter. He studied his dull, heavy 
prosthesis in the mirror — after 
almost a fourth of a century he 
had grown accustomed to seeing it 
peeking out from under his left eye 
lid. Still, the prospect of a real eye 
excited him. 

A S SOON as he entered the 
• outer office of Organ Banks 
he felt a yearning for good health. 
The decor strongly suggested 
youth and vigor — holograms of 
towering softwoods, thundering 
surf and copious waterfalls. The 
brown-eyed girl, attractive and 
slightly erotic, stirred him. He was 
suddenly grateful that he was 
shopping for an eye and not a set of 
gonads. 

He explained why he was there 
and she quickly went into a sales 
patter: “Our Genetic Carbon Copy 
is precisely what you need. It will 
match your right eye exactly — in 
size, color and antigens. Same 
genes — same antigens. No danger 
of rejection. It will be a complete 
eye — optic nerve, retina, lens and 
sclera — grown from your own 
genetic material. It is true that an 
ordinary eye from another doner 



will not work satisfactorily. We 
can’t match the antigens close 
enough. CNS tissue is very critical 
that way. Even the slightest 
rejection can prove fatal because of 
the cross reaction with your own 
brain tissues. Any antibody will 
have some cross reactions with 
other similar antigens. In CNS 
tissues this is quickly fatal. Even a 
small amount of antibody can 
upset the membrane activity of a 
nerve cell — psychoses and demye- 
linating diseases like multiple scle- 
rosis result. But the GCC — since 
it is your own tissue — doesn’t have 
any of those problems,” 

He wasn’t sure he understood 
inost of what she was trying to tell 
him. He hesitated. 

“It all sounds so complicated. 
I’m not so sure that — ” he began. 

“Now we don’t have to decide 
immediately,” she said soothingly. 
“First let’s see if you are a poten- 
tial candidate for a transplant.” 

She led him into a small examin- 
ing booth and made a big 
ceremony out of washing her 
hands. She asked him to remove 
the artificial eye and examined the 
empty socket with a scented finger. 
Then she placed an EEG sensor 
over the back of his head and asked 
him to shut his right eye. She 
tickled the empty socket with a 
microvolt probe and watched the 
EEG readout. 

“Looks like your optic nerve 
hasn’t scarred too badly,” she said. 
“Its axons are gone, of course; but 



28 



IF 




the new ones will grow from the 
ganglion cells in the transplanted 
retina. I’d say you’re an excellent 
candidate for a transplant.” 

She washed her hands again. He 
replaced the prosthesis and blinked ■ 
it into place. 

“Now there is the matter of the 
fee. Growing the GCC eye runs 
into seven figures,” she said. 

“Deneb credits?” he asked cas- 
ually. 

“Stellar megafrancs,” she said. 

He sputtered. 

She looked pained. “I’m dread- 
fully sorry, Caesar. 1 just assumed 
that you knew. Our customers pay 
their own way, of course. There are 
the costs of the culture tanks, 
embryonating equipment biochem- 
ists and technicians, monitoring 
devices and finally the surgery it- 
self. Growing a GCC is a very ex- 
acting proceedure — and very ex- 
pensive.” 

He left as gracefully as he could. 
Stellar megafrancs meant a life- 
time of saving — or a big gamble 
won. If he hoped Jo earn that kind 
of money he’d have to try 
patrolling the Los Coyotes 
Diagonal, where he had a chance of 
earning hazard premiums plus 
possible salvage. He might make 
his megafranc there, if he sur- 
vived. 

II 

D uty on the Los Coyotes Di- 
agonal — trade route to the 



Dog Star — consisted of months of 
boredom interspersed with 
moments of terror. Fifty parsecs of 
empty space — no biologically 
friendly planets — not even a 
manned satellite. Natural hazards 
were minimal on the route. 
However, like other uninhabited 
routes on the edge of the human- 
occupied sectors, the diagonal had 
its share of random, weird kid- 
napings. An occasional starship 
would be stripped of its human 
complement — crew and any 
genetic cargo. The ship itself, its 
tools, weapons, and other items of 
human wealth were left intact. Vio- 
lence was absent. 

The usual assumption involved a 
hypothetical race of advanced 
aliens — dubbed The Dregs by the 
popular press — aliens who valued 
humans for some reason but had 
no use for human tools. Caesar 
found it hard to imagine a race 
whose technology or ethics pre- 
vented them from seizing the ships 
along with the men; but he agreed 
that he was the best man to hunt 
them. He had been hunting his 
own personal Beast most of his life 
and hunting the unseen Dregs was 
very much the same. Statistics 
showed that kidnapings involved 
the freighters and more sluggish 
Implant ships. The presence of a 
single high-performance starship 
anywhere on the route seemed to 
protect it. Insurance cartels paid 
well for this type of duty. He and 
Jen-B cruised about, testing their 



29 



IF 




energy weapons* and setting out 
noisy beacons — making their 
presence known. 

•‘Wake up. Caesar. Derelict 
ahead,” called Jen-B. 

Six years of false alarms and he 
still felt a chill at the thought of 
meeting the Dregs. He suited up 
and watched the screen. A ship 
appeared — an old human model. 

“She’s quiet. No signs of energy 
in her hull,” said Jen-B. They stood 
off and bounced a variety of sig- 
nals off the derelict — even nudged 
it a bit with a tractor beam. 
Nothing happened. 

“Might as well go on board. See 
what I can find,” said Caesar. 

If the Dregs had struck the ship 
he knew what to expisct. No 
humans would be left on board. 

But he found humans. Dead 
ones. An all-male crew of thirty- 
seven plus a score of passengers 
— both sexes— all dead of natural 
causes that could be summed up 
as old age. 

Jen-B sent her servomech prowl- 
ing about the derelict’s hull. in 
search of answers. It dug around in 
a cold reactor core, energized a few 
senile circuits and sampled several 
of the frozen and dried corpses. 
Caesar searched the cabins. He 
found no signs of violence. Several 
examples of poor housekeeping 
suggested that the older survivors 
had lost some of their mental 
facilities. He found a handwritten 
diary in one of the uniform 
pockets. The last dozen pages were 



mostly illegible except for the 
repeated entry: “Bay A-3.” 

Bay A-3 was in the cargo 
section. The derelict had carried a 
payload of Water World Biota — 
valuable flora and fauna that rep- 
resented millions of years of aqua- 
tic evolution. A ri 9 h genetic cargo 
— still suspended and, apparently, 
still viable. Caesar moved among 
the bays until he came to A-3. He 
paused at the hatch fumbling with 
his thick gloves. Inside, he waited 
for his suit light to brighten. 

The bay had been stripped of 
most of its suspended biota and a 
makeshift tank had been con- 
structed. A tiny mummy occupied 
the tank. It took him a moment to 
realize that it was the body of a 
human baby — probably around 
ten pound size. From the looks of 
the wires and tubes the tank was 
the work of someone with little 
knowledge of the suspension pro- 
cess. He hoped the infant had been 
dead before it had been hooked 
up — mercifully dead. Water 
World suspension tanks did not 
modify to human support easily. 
He returned to the Control Sec- 
tion. 

The servomech was busy with 
the astrogational components of 
the derelict. 

“I think we can get her moving. 
This may be the salvage that we’ve 
been looking for,” Jen-B said over 
his helmet communicator. 

“What happened? Why is every- 
one dead?” 



30 



IF 




“Computer failure,” answered 
Jen-B. “This is one of the older 
models — fully automated — one 
mechanical intelligence. No 
backups. Evidently no one on 
board could rig the warp drive for 
manual override. That would prob- 
ably have been suicide anyway. 
Fortunately this is a greenhouse 
class — there was plenty of food and 
oxygen for the humans to live out 
their life spans. But out here on the 
Diagonal nothing is within range of 
a conventional drive. They just 
lived out their lives between stars. 
They could see their pile running 
down so they didn’t try to raise 
children. “The one infant you saw 
in Bay A-3 was probably an 
accidental birth. Without energy 
to run the hydroponics section they 
knew how long the ship could 
support life; and there are no 
facilities on board to suspend 
humans.” 

No, there wouldn’t be, thought 
Caesar. That was one of the 
advantages of a greenhouse star- 
ship. You made the trip warm. 



R efueled, the derelict 
moved and, with the servo- 
mech providing the “brains,” it 
managed to limp back to Deneb on 
the laser tail of Jen-B. After pick- 
ing up their credits at Salvage — al- 
most an even megafranc — Jen-B 
cheeked in at the Academy and 
Caesar started out . for the Organ 
Banks. 



He stopped off at Orphanage 
309 on the way. 

Weathering had lowered the hills 
behind the playground and the 
trees looked stouter; but the build- 
ing was unchanged. A nostalgic 
Caesar entered the Library. He 
was no longer the pliant youth of 
309. Gray streaked his red hair. 
Freckles had fused into a diffuse 
bronze under the actinic stimula- 
tion of alien suns. Trunk and 
extremities had thickened with 
added muscle and gristle. 

“Remember me?” he asked the 
desk. 

A hum under the floor tickldd his 
feet. After a few moments the 
speaker coughed and said, “You 
are the wandering pacemaker — 
Little Caesar with the legacy.” 

“I’ve just returned from a tour of 
duty on the Diagonal. Came back 
for a new eye from the Organ 
Banks. I was wondering if you 
could tell me anything about my 
people. My family.” 

Silence. He waited a respectable 
length of time and asked, “The 
Beast?” 

“The Beast does not exist,” said 
Library immediately. 

Caesar shrugged. Even after all 
these years Library’s slow circuits 
were consistent. The old desk 
grumbled something and then its 
voice softened. 

“Little Caesar. How you have 
grown! You are a bigger man 
now — and older. I hope you 
haven’t neglected that body of 



THE BEAST OF 309 



31 




yours. You haven’t given up the 
Long Run have you?” 

Caesar’s eyebrows rose slightly. 
“There wasn’t much opportunity 
for running out on the Diagonal. 
But I’ve taken care of myself. I can 
still run.” 

“If you’d like to run before lunch 
you may use the refresher. There’s 
a remote unit on the peg in there,” 
said Library. The words were more 
a maternal command than an offer. 

He hung his shoes and shirt on 
the peg and clipped the palm-sized 
remote unit to his belt. He walked 
across the playground — his bare 
soles tingling at each pebble and 
blade of grass. A sweating five- 
year-old returning from the course 
nodded gravely as he passed. The 
morning was mildly sunny. 

He stepped out briskly, cover- 
ing the first four hundred yards in 
record time (for him). He had 
kept his muscles toned up in his 
starship gym and they carried 
him well. The muscles were large 
— with large capillary beds to 
store the lactic acid and carbon 
dioxide they were producing. His 
vascular system was slow to ad- 
just to the exertion and his pH 
dropped a hundredth of a point. 
The acidosis surprised his chem- 
oreceptors and his pulse began to 
race. 

“Good pace,” said Library over 
the remote unit. 

At the first mile marker he felt 
like a fish out of water. Gasping 
and dizzy, he slowed to a walk. 



Then, as the course turned down- 
hill, the going became easier and he 
began to jog again. He waited for a 
second wind but none came. He 
hair-pinned the pine tree at the 
three-mile' marker. Thirsty. No 
canteen. 

“Thirty-three minutes, five sec- 
onds,” announced Library. 

His coronary arteries — become 
small in the years without 
endurance activity — were unable to 
meet the demands of his heart 
muscle. Straining on the return 
up-slope he developed chest pain. 
Synovial edema puckered his gait 
and a limp appeared as he neared 
the playground. His vision swam. 
Numbness prickled at his face and 
hands. Still no second wind. The 
neglected cardiorespiratory ma- 
chinery was unable to shift into 
overdrive. Gasping and clutching 
at his aching chest, he fell across 
the finish line. His face was wet and 
pale. Saliva drooled out of the 
corner of his mouth. 

“Seventy-four minutes, twelve 
seconds,” said Library. 

In his contortions his glassy eye 
fell out and rolled, moist and 
gritty, in the dust. Several minutes 
passed before feeling returned to 
him and he picked it up— popping 
it into his mouth to clean it. 
Spitting out the offending dirt, he 
blinked the prosthesis back under 
his left eyelid and sat up straight, 
breathing deeply. 

“Good workout,” said Library. 

“Really good,” he said wryly. 



32 



IF 




A t organ banks he was 

ushered into the office of one 
of the senior parameds. After some 
preliminary discussion and nod- 
ding the fee was nailed down and 
addenda supplied. 

“A Genetic Carbon Copy 
eye — 0.711 mf. The project 
requires a four-year growing 
period. You must realize that if 
you decide to cancel only that part 
of the megafranc that hasn’t been 
used can be returned. You are 
liable for all the expenses for your 
project.” 

Caesar ignored the paramed’s 
indifferent manner and asked, 
“Why four years?” 

The paramed glanced at his well- 
groomed fingernails. “Takes that 
long to reach the size to match 
your other eye. Can’t use a banked 
eye because of the danger of 
rejection. Don’t want any of those 
nasty anti-CNS antibodies run- 
ning around, now — do we?” 

“No. I suppose not. But how do 
you grow an eye? Do you take a 
piece of my good eye and — ” 

The paramed shook his head, 
reached into his desk for a folder. 
“Here. This explains our GCC pro- 
cess. We can’t grow most adult 
tissue in an organ form. Only the 
immature cells divide well and they 
quickly upset any gross anatomic 
structures such as you’d need in an 
organ like the eye. The lens, cor- 
nea, retina and optic nerve — none 
of these structures can be cultured 
as such. We have to harvest the 



eye bud from an embryo and grow 
that. 

“We just draw a blood sample 
and isolate some of your 
lymphocytes — a young white blood 
cell that divides very easily. When 
the lymphocytes are growing well 
we freeze some, grow some and 
remove the nuclei from some. 
These naked nuclei are implanted 
into human egg cytoplasm — eggs 
from which their own nuclei have 
been removed. The egg with your 
naked nucleus divides and 
embryonates with only your genes 
present — producing your GCC. 
We just grow it until it is large 
enough to harvest the transplant 
material we are after.” 

The folder Caesar was looking at 
showed several examples of culture 
tanks. One contained a liver for a 
post-hepatitis patient. Another a 
pair of lungs for a victim of 
beryllium poisoning. The round 
lymphocyte drawing with its lacy 
nucleus reminded him of his red 
ball. 

“That naked nucleus carries all 
the genes necessary to grow an 
entire individual?” asked Caesar. 

“That is correct.” 

Caesar studied the diagram of 
the optic nerves. They were shaped 
like a large X, half of each nerve 
crossing the midline on its way 
back from the retina to the 
geniculate bodies in the midbrain. 
A photomicrograph showed 
millions of separate nerve fibers. 

He frowned. “I’ve done a little

work with computers and Tve 
learned that hookups between 
sensors and cybernetic units are 
very critical. All the connections 
have to be exact or incoming 
information can’t be interpreted. 
How can anyone match up all these 
separate nerve fibers?” he asked. 

The paramed looked pained. 
“Those nerve fibers are coming 
from nerve cells in the retina. The 
hookups in organic systems aren’t 
so critical. The visual cortex 
relearns how to interpret incoming 
signals. All we have to do is inject 
some geniculate RNA in your optic 
nerve stump. That gets most of the 
new axons growing down the right 
, direction. The anastomosis is 
coated with what we call CNS 
sealer, a mixture of embryonic 
connective tissue — from one of 
your GCC embryos — and matura- 
tion hormones from pituitary and 
thyroid. The CNS sealer “sets” 
quickly and matures to adult con- 
nective tissue before the cut ends 
of the nerve can scar too badly.” 

“But my brain hasn’t been able 
to see with my left eye for all these 
years. Hasn’t it lost the ability per- 
manently?” 

The paramed pointed to the 
center of the X on the diagram. 
“Half of the fibers from your right 
eye cross over, here, at the optic 
chiasma. So, with just one eye you 
have been using both sides of your 
visual cortex. The new left eye will 
just be adding more informa- 
tion — reinforcing the images. You 



probably won’t even notice the 
increased acuity — it’ll occur so 
gradually. The biggest change will 
be the addition of your left lateral 
peripheral vision. You have none 
now — your nose is sort of in the 
way. But once the images balance 
you’ll be able to learn to hold your 
head straight again.” 

Caesar had not been aware of 
how obvious his cock-eyed gaze 
was. He had a habit of carrying his 
head turned slightly to the left so 
that his right visual field was 
centered on what he was looking 
at. Two eyes would square up his 
posture again. He rolled up his 
sleeve for the venipuncture. 



H e approached his scoot- 
er. The hatch opened arid Jen- 
B’s voice came over the communi- 
cator. 

“All finished up on the sur- 
face?” 

“I guess so. I’m coming up. 
Warm up something light for 
supper.” 

He strapped himself in. The light 
scooter arced quickly toward the 
orbiting starship. 

“How did you make out with 
Academy?” he asked. 

“Fine,” Jen-B said. “They’re 
well pleased with our profit 
margin so far. I have a promising 
list of new missions. When will you 
have to return for your GCC eye?” 
“Four years.” 

There was a moment’s pause 



34 



IF 




while the starship balanced the 
time requirements against the 
potential income of each mission. 
“Two parsecs is the range,” she 
said. “We can stay here and take 
up people-moving. There’s mining 
in the Tietze System. Charting in 
the—’’ 

“Mining?” he interrupted. “Part 
of my legacy was in mining stock. 
Something called the Mother- 
Lode-Planetoid. Can you check 
with Library and see if there is any 
record that would link my legacy 
with the Tietze Planetoids. I’ve 
been trying to find out about my 
family but Library doesn’t like to 
talk about parents.” 

Jen-B opened a channel to the 
Orphanage. “Library is only a 
class nine. Not too reliable. There’s 
no cross indexing between you and 
Tietze. Better relax and finish your 
supper while I try a few more lines 
of questioning.” 

He ate from a wide-necked 
squeeze tube that contained spicy 
protein cubes in a warm broth of 
aromatic hydrocarbons. Finally 
Jen-B said: “Library is full of 
blocks about people — you, your 
parents, your condition prior to 
operation. But the lines of 
information are pretty exacting 
when assets are involved. Your 
legacy did contain that 'mining 
stock. It was a Tietze-based com- 
pany. The date your legacy was 
set up was early in the year One 
Thousand ninety-nine, D.I.T. It 
opened at zero point, three three 



seven magafrancs. Information 
on the person opening the legacy is 
scanty. He was an off-world 
human, alive — no probated will or 
anything like that. I can’t find his 
name, but he had red hair and was 
staying at a local address with a 
large number of injured miners.” 

“Red hair?’’ said Caesar 
enthusiastically. “He must have 
been my father.” But he was left 
with more unanswered questions — 
why the legacy at all if the leaver 
were alive? Or, if no longer alive, 
where had he died? And why hadn’t 
the legacy-leaver taken Caesar 
with him when he left? Caesar 
quickly ran through the list of pos- 
sible reasons why a father would 
leave his son in an prphanage. All 
he could come up with was the 
possibility that he — Caesar — 

might be illegitimate. Unwanted. 
His own name, Caesar, was simi- 
lar to the names of the other il- 
legitimates he had known. They 
had all been given names of pow- 
erful men — planet conquerors — 
in the hopes that these would bring 
them some of the luck of their 
namesakes. 

He frowned at Jen-B’s panel. “I 
suppose there is nb record of where 
he went after he left the legacy.” 

“Nothing connecting the legacy- 
leaver with any of the other 
memory bigs.” Jen-B said. “The 
blocks arc complete around him. 
But the number of miners in the 
rehabilitation section with him 
indicates a fairly large mining

accident a year or so prior. No 
mines on Deneb record such a dis- 
aster; Tietze is a logical place to 
begin our search, A redhead with 
zero point three megafrancs 
shouldn’t be too hard to trace if he 
is linked with a large mining 
accident. We know the approxi- 
mate date and I have a list of the 
securities that were put into your 
legacy.” 

Caesar hesitated for a moment. 
He didn’t like mixing business with 
her personal life — might jeopardize 
profit Finally he assented. 

“We’ll ne^ a navigator to bring 
back the ore. Have one in mind?” 
he asked. 

“There’s a poet at Cyber Cen- 
tral, He’s about'^ three hundred 
years old. But he has been on the 
Tietze route several times and his 
price is right.” 

Caesar nodded, his mind on the 
legacy-leaver. 

“I’ll send the scooter for him,” 
continued Jen-B. 

Caesar stood in the cargo bay 
when Navigator was off-loaded. 
He was old and corroded. About 
the size of a human, he would 
weigh about 1,300 pounds down on 
the surface. He consisted of three 
units: a fuel-cell abdomen, a 
cybernetic thorax and a sensory 
head — all joined by narrow, 
flexible joints. Other than an 
extendible neck, he had no motor 
units. Caesar wiped a finger across 
his gritty chassis. 

“Your skin is a mess,” he said. 



“Too much oxygen and water 
vapor down there. But don’t worry 
about me. I’ll be fine as soon as I’m 
out in a vacuum again,” said Navi- 
gator. 

Caesar glanced over his shoulder 
toward one of Jen-B’s panels. 

“Are you sure he’ll be all 
right?” 

Navigator’s head — a sphere with 
a circumference of sensors — an- 
thropomorphized its appearance 
by brightening up a pair of “eyes” 
and turning them on Caesar. He 
actually looked sheepish. 

Jen-B answered, “Navigator has 
been debauching his energy stores 
and letting his body age, but it was 
for an understandable reason. He 
wanted to be near Music Box. He 
calculated that he had become 
obsolete and he planned to spend 
his final years with the machine he 
loved. Music Box and he were com- 
posing ballads — finishing tunes he 
had started while out listening to 
the stars. All he needs is a recharge 
and a new coat of polyjner. He’ll 
do fine.” 

Caesar glanced back at Navi- 
gator’s downcast optic pickups. 
“Relax, Poet. You are a member 
of the crew now.”

O N THE TRIP to Tietze Cae- 
sar tolerated a lot of weird 
music. Navigator and Jen-B shared 
the electromagnetic music from 
the stars. Jen-B’s outer sensors

^ IF 




gathered m the stellar noise and 
fed it through Navigator’s un- 
scrambler circuits. It came out as 
music only a machine could ap- 
preciate. 

For trading purposes Jen-B had 
picked up a dozen small dairy 
units — goat/clover/bee implants 
designed for low gravity dome liv- 
ing. The entire Tietze system was 
rich in heavy metals — an H type 
star circled by uncounted plane- 
toids, the largest only a 0.6 G 
planet that had a tenuous 
atmosphere and a few simple local 
phylla. The Deneb system with its 
single planet was fairly metal-poor. 
The usual commerce consisted in 
exchanging Deneb genetic informa- 
tion for Tietze planetoids. The size 
of a planetoid was expressed in 
terms of the number of pounds that 
the bartering captain would weigh 
on its surface. A convenient size 
for accelerating back to Deneb 
would have a pull of between 0.1 
and 1.0 pounds on Caesar. These 
units were called “donans” after 
the pioneer Mother-Lode engineer. 

Jen-B nuzzled up to the Tietze 
satellite station which housed the 
Buyer — a humanoid robot. Qua- 
sistellar engines were anchored to 
the ends of the satellite’s arms. 
Human technicians swarmed over 
Jen-B’s cargo enthusiastically. The 
microcontainers of naked nuclei 
looked monotonous to Caesar, but 
the Tietze system humans under- 
stood their coded labels. In a 
system where the local ecology had 



produced nothing more complex 
than moss and nematodes, every 
flower and butterfly had to be 
brought across parsecs of empty 
space. After hundreds of years the 
local biology textbooks had only 
a two-page glossary. Even a new 
weed would be welcome if it 
looked, smelled or tasted different. 

The mechanical Buyer remained 
aloof. “We already have a dairy 
animal. I can offer you a zero- 
point-one donan planetoid for 
your cargo.” 

“But that is a pretty large breed 
of cattle you’re talking about. 
Suitable for the grazing lands on 
Tietze’s largest planet. I’m offer- 
ing you a thirty-pound milk goat 
that can go anywhere a man can 
go. It produces a couple quarts of 
milk a day and can be bred 
yearly — usually has twin births. 
Any dome city can raise goats on a 
hydroponics farm.” said Caesar. 

Buyer remained silent. 

I’ll personally stay and see that 
the implants get established. But 
I’ll need 0.5 donan.” 

Buyer agreed immediately. 
Payment on delivery of established 
implants. It would take about a 
year to get them started — plant the 
clover, rewarm the bees and 
embryonate the goats. Jen-B began 
to cycle the goat naked nuclei into 
their respective eggs. Domes were 
selected. The clover was planted in 
every open place — along walks, in 
decorative flower boxes — on 
roofs. It was a pleasant sight to see 



THE BEAST OF 309 



37 




one of the citizens returning to his 
home — a home with half a dozen 
baby goats grazing on its roof. 
The little animals accepted the 
gravity of the smaller planetoids 
and seemed to enjoy the long leaps 
from roof to roof. Psychologically 
there were an asset — a symbol of 
their owners’ protein indepen- 
dence and a break in the monoto- 
ny of the scanty dome ecology. 

The mechanical Buyer followed 
the growth curves of the new goats. 
Implant success hinged on success- 
ful reproduction, and the animals 
seemed to be approaching sexual 
maturity on schedule. A set of Q. 
engines were detached from the 
Buyer’s satellite^ tested and fueled 
with quarks. An inventory of 0.5 
donan planetoids was prepared — 
each with its analysis. Caesar car^ 
ried the preliminary list with him 
as he traveled about, watching the 
goats mature. When they passed 
one of the planetoids on the list 
Jen-B marked its composition, size 
and orbit on her chart of the Tiet- 
ze system. 

C AESAR noticed a little girl 
with some goats and thought 
she looked familiar. She had the 
same red hair and freckles that he 
had as a child. Her father also had 
some of his features. 

He was checking the goat 
implant in a dome city on one of 
the outer 0.2 gravity planetoids. 
He spoke to the girl. 

‘‘My great-grandfather and 



grandfather were both killed at the 
mine,” she said matter-of-factly. 
“They’ve closed it down now.” 

“Where is the mine?” asked 
Caesar. He had gone over this 
planetoid earlier when the goats 
had been implanted. No large 
mines had been in operation 
during the years he was interested 
in. 

She looked through the 
semitransparent dome and 
pointed toward the horizon. 

“The mine was on Fish Moon.” 

An oblong planetoid was barely 
visible — a crescent of light in the 
glare of the Tietze sun — a tiny 
thumbnail size. 

He thanked her, {5atted a goat’s 
knobby head and went back to his 
scooter. 

On their trip to Fish Moon Jen- 
B made her observations. “Ten- 
donan size. But it has two large 
fracture lines — so essentially it 
consists of three separate masses 
now. Mining complex cold — no 
energy. Just a robot sentinel. Better 
wear your heavy with its extra 
bottles — the domes appear unpres- 
surized.” 

He watched Fish Moon’s 
approach on the viewscreen. It did 
look a little like a fish. One of the 
fracture lines could be the gills and 
the other ran longitudinal — like a 
fish’s lateral line. The bright 
reHecting surfaces and the sharp, 
black shadows reminded him of 
fins and scales. Soon he was close 
enough to see the domes and Helds 
of the abandoned mine. It was 

IF 



38 




located at the junction of the two 
fracture lines — about where he 
would expect the fish’s pectoral fin 
to be. 

Jen-B moved the scooter, to the 
unloading bay. 

“Sentinel says he is alone — a 
class X or XI on our system intelli- 
gence grade. I’m sending a 
servomech. Tapper, along with 
you. You’ll probably have to 
probe the mine’s old memory cir- 
cuits yourself. Sentinel doesn’t 
have the power.’’ 

Caesar climbed into the scooter 
and smiled at Tapper’s little barrel 
shape — six stubby legs, two small 
optic pickups, a V antenna in front 
and a stout carrying handle down 
his back. He was a ten-gallon size 
and reminded Caesar of a giant 
ladybug. Tapper wrapped his six 
stubby legs around the anh rest of 
Caesar’s couch and waited. 

While Tapper worked in the cold 
dark conduits of the mine’s 
memory components, Caesar 
casually picked up several chips 
and fed them into the Scooter’s 
analysis port. The analysis of each 
flickered across scooter’s screen as 
it was relayed to Jen-B. The chips 
were spat out and dropped slowly 
to the ground. They were 
unchanged, except for the three 
pin-sized, burn-holes of the 
analyzer. 

“We are in luck,’’ said Tapper 
over the communicator. “This is 
the standard Hagan memory 
pattern. If it is intact I’ll be back 

THE BEAST OF 309 



into the disaster data in a few 
minutes.’’ 

Caesar picked up another hand- 
ful of chips. These had been in con- 
tact with each other during the 
twenty-odd years of hard vacuum. 
Their molecules had migrated 
across the contact interface — fus- 
ing them into one crystallized 
mass. The first sample of chips— 
lying separate on the polymere 
floor — had not fused to anything. 
Outside the domi: the entire plan- 
etoid surface consisted of one 
fused mass — soft dust and loose 
gravel had settled and crystallized 
into the harsh surface of an in- 
dustrial grinding wheel. 

“Found your legacy-leaver,’’ 
announced Tapper. “Portfolio 
matches. He was one of the 
foremen — injured badly in the 
explosion. Fault lines appeared in 
Fish Moon — vacuum explosioi)s, 
high oxygen flash fires and tunnel 
collapse. His name — Walter S.J. 
Varley — does not match any of the 
data we have from Deneb. But now 
that we have his name we should be 
able to learn. more back there. He 
left for Deileb thirty-nine years 
ago. 

Caesar said nothing. 

The goats were bred success- 
fully. As the fetuses grew in the 
uteri the mechanical Buyer 
ordered Q. engine installation on 
the planetoid Caesar had selected. 
Jen-B assigned Tapper and 
Navigator to observe the con- 
struction.

4<'T' HE goats are coming. The 
-Igoats are coming,” shouted 
the little red-haired girl. Her father 
got up from his coffee-and-cake 
and went up the ladder to the goat 
shed on the roof. When the 
message arrived Caesar hurried to 
assist with the delivery. 

“Not niuch to worry about, 
Caesar,” said Jen-B. “The babies 
are small and the mother's pelvis is 
more than adequate. About the 
only thing we could do is raise the 
atmospheric oxygen to protect 
the second twin. When there are' 
two like this the cord and placenta 
of the second one are subject to 
occasional damage during the 
delivery of the first.” 

They arrived in Time to witness 
the birth of the second baby goat. 
Its wet, boney body came out fast 
in a gush of cloudy fluids. The little 
girl's father kneeled in the dried 
clover bedding and deftly plucked 
the membranes from the heads of 
the newborns. 

“Implant's a success,” said Jen 
B. 

The girl's father — tall and red- 
headed like Caesar — invited him in 
for a glass of celebration. The 
drink was white and bubbly and 
had a bitter, alcoholic sting. Caesar 
was grateful that it was served in 
very small glasses. 

The little girl's mother — also a 
redhead — was breast-feeding two 
tiny infants. They were about eight 
or nine pounds in size — one a 
freckled redhead, the other a dark. 



olive-skinned baby with coal black 
hair. When he was back in his 
scooter, arcing up towards Jen-B 
Caesar commented on the two 
different genetic appearances of 
the human children. 

“A dividend from our implant- 
planetoid-exchange. One of the 
implant vials contained a broad 
spectrum of human naked 
nuclei — the rainbow mix,” said 
Jen-B. “I cycled several through 
embryogenesis to correlate with 
the human pregnancy so they'd 
have milk.” 

Caesar looked puzzled. “What 
have humans to do with our dairy 
implants?” 

“Goatherds,” said Jen-B simply. 

Well, thought Caesar, the Tietze 
System could certainly use a little 
broadening of its human genetic 
base. 



J EN-B orbited the bartered plan- 
etoid about two diameters out. 
The Q. engines were installed and 
Navigator had tied himself into 
the communications net. Caesar 
stood by, carrying Tapper by his 
dorsal handle. 

“Ready?” asked Navigator. 

“Try a hundredth of a gravity,” 
suggested Caesar. 

The vibration of the engines — 
transmitted through about a hun^ 
dred miles of ore — passed up 
through his feet to his cranial 
nerve. He “heard” their quasistel- 
lar fires. He felt the center of grav- 



40 



IF 




ity of the planetoid shift slightly 
aft. 

Navigator adjusted the engine’s 
fields — fondling the little captive 
pieces of the sun, Caesar leaned 
against the scooter and glanced 
nervously up at Jen-B’s orbiting 
hull. 

“Feels like the center of gravity 
is moving back toward the 
engines,” he said. 

“We’re moving,” said Naviga- 
tor. “The vectors of acceleration 
are the same — gravity or engine. 
You’re feeling thd resultant force.” 

“What happens when the center 
of gravity moves above the sur- 
face?” he asked. 

“That’s when we find out if 
we’ve bought ourselves a nugget or 
a pile of rocks,” said Navigator 
casually. 

Caesar climbed into his scooter. 
“Well, good luck. The stockhold- 
ers will be happy to see you. Have 
a nice trip.” 

Navigator did have a nice trip. 
His sensors listened for music in 
the planetoid’s vibrations and the 
electromagnetic spectrum of the 
background stars. Finding a tune 
everywhere, he sang along — com- 
posing new ballads. 

Ballads he would sing to Music 
Box when he returned to Deneb, 

IV 

C AESAR lugged Tapper’s bulk 
into the Orphanage and set him 
on Library’s desk. 



“I’m going to check in at the 
Clinic. You two see if you can get 
along until I return,” he said. 

Tapper shifted his weight on his 
little feet and waved his antennae. 
Library felt a flush of warmth as 
Tapper’s powerful sympathy fields 
caressed old memory cores. 

“What manner of a machine is 
this?” asked Library. 

“I am Tapper — a remote unit of 
Jen-B — a class VI.” 

Then, after a pause Tapper 
turned to Caesar: “You go ahead 
and see about your GCC eye. 
Everything is fine here.” 



T 'HE paramed probed his soc- 
ket with a gloved finger. 

“Now look up. That’s fine.” 
Caesar felt the nubbin of muscle 
flex and twitch under the 
examining finger. 

“Good ocular muscle tone. Mov- 
ing that prosthesis around has been 
good exercise. These stumps are 
well developed,” said the paramed. 
He cupped the EEG pickup over 
the back of his head and prol^d the 
eye socket with the stimulator 
probe. “Patent nerve. Visual cortex 
okay.” 

He snapped off his glove while 
Caesar blinked back the glassy 
prosthesis. 

“Be ready for surgery in two 
days?” asked the paramed. 

Caesar shifted in his chair. He 
' was iCareful not to look at any of 
the little display tanks— afraid

he’d, see his new eye peeking at 
him. 

“Now don’t worry about the 
pain,’’ comforted the paramed. 
“You’ll be sound asleep when they 
peel out the old scar. There are a 
dozen or so vessels to hook up on 
the back of the eye ball. That takes 
some fine stitching under a micro- 
scope. We have an oriental 
technician that does a beautiful 
job at that. The nerve hookup is 
easy with the quick setting CNS 
sealer. “Your eyes will be taped for 
a few weeks. But otherwise there 
won’t be much inconvenience. The 
postoperative discomfort can be 
covered satisfactorily with a few 
All-Purpose Capsules each day.” 

Caesar nodded and started to 
leave. 

“Here, don’t forget your seeing- 
eye cap,” said the paramed. He 
handed Caesar a thin skullcap with 
a pair of optic pickups on the front 
and a prickly layer of skin 
electrodes on the inside. He tried it 
on. 

“Feels like a pillow full of nails,” 
he said. 

The paramed touched one of the 
optic pickups. “You’ve been used 
to seeing with your right eye. I’ll 
turn off the left pickup. Now shut 
your eye and tell me what you see.” 

“Just blackness — nothing. Oh, 
there is some light. Colored. Looks 
like a lot of colored ink blots.” 

“Fine. The impulses are getting 
through. Open your eye to give 
your cortex a clue to what you are 



looking at. Now close it again.” 

Caesar thought he saw a solid 
square. Then it became a square 
hole in a solid wall. He opened his 
eye a few more times and soon his 
cortex was correctly interpreting 
lights from shadows through the 
cap’s pickup. 

The paramed tuned the fine 
adjustment. Secondary images 
began to demarcate — furniture in 
the room was clear enough to be 
avoided if he wanted to try walking 
with the cap. But he couldn’t tell 
what was on the desk and he 
couldn’t recognize the humanoid 
blob that was the paramed. 

“This is great. How well will I 
be able to see with this thing?” 
asked Caesar. 

“Not much better than that. 
Enough to find the refresher and 
the food tray. There are only about 
a hundred electrodes in this 
model — and they just rest on top of 
the scalp. Can’t focus well on that 
part of the visual cortex that is 
folded in between the two halves of 
your occipital lobes. We have pro- 
duced twenty/eighty vision with 
the ten thousand electrode model, 
but they were sewn into the dural 
membranes under the skull.” 

Caesar took off the cap. “Fine. 
I’ll practice with this thing at 
night. See you in two days.” 

“Right.” 

He found Tapper still resting on 
Library’s desk. 

“Learn anything?” he asked. 

Tapper shifted his barrel shape 



42 



IF 




around and focused on Caesar. 
“Not much.” he answered. 
“Library is a class IX. He’s old and 
has been using a non-Hagan 
language for storage. I thought 
there were blocks around you and 
the legacy-leaver — so did Jen- 
B — but the circuits are clean. No 
memory blocks. Cross indexing 
was just neglected in your case. 
You suddenly appear in the 
memory banks on the date of your 
enucleation — nothing from your 
past is entered. Your legacy is per- 
fectly recorded — only your legacy- 
leaver is vague. The name — Walter 
S.J. Varley — means nothing to 
Library. It is odd that these things 
would go unrecorded.” 

“Caesar. Did you find your 
legacy-leaver?” asked Library. 

“I think so, Library. I traced the 
legacy itself back to the Tietze 
System. Apparently the legacy- 
leaver was a man much like myself 
but a miner — injured. He came 
here to Deneb for rehabilitation. 
He may have been married on his 
home planetoid, but he didn’t 
bring a wife to Deneb.” 

“None of them brought wives,” 
said Tapper. 

Library filed that information 
away, “information about parents 
I do not record as long as it con- 
forms to niy basic norms.” 

“What norms?” asked Caesar. 
“Good genes.” 

Caesar reviewed what he knew. 
The legacy-leaver was a foreman. 
Somatic similarities suggested that 



he could be Caesar’s father. But 
many of the other workers from 
Tietze were related. Any could 
have fathered him. If his mother 
was a local Deneb girl, the legacy 
might well have been left to cover 
for the abandoned child of any of 
the Tietze workers. The foreman 
might have been acting in his 
company’s name rather than his 
own family name. Well, either way 
the conclusion was the same. 
Caesar was an unwanted child who 
had been left to “go it alone.” 
Library had raised him well, he 
decided. 

Caesar placed his right hand on 
Tapper’s dorsal handle and began 
to lift. Then, almost as an after- 
thought, he replaced the cyber- 
netic barrel on the desk. It was a 
sunny day. 

“Might as well take a Long Run 
while I’m here,” he said. 

“Take it easy. The last time you 
tried that you had some ischemic 
S-T depression,” said Tapper, 
reflecting Jen-B’s concern. Her 
sensors, wired into his body, picked 
up physiological parameters and 
telemetered them back. His cardio- 
gram consisted of an electrical 
tracing with the waves labeled 
P,Q,R,S and T. Depolarization of 
the upper chambers of the heart 
caused the P wave. The QRS 
complex was the result of 
depolarization of the large ventric- 
ular muscles that pump the bjood. 
The flat segment between S and T 
waves reflected lack of oxygen. The

heart sags when the myocardium 
gets ischemic. If the ischemia is too 
severe the muscle can die. This 
raises the S-T segment sharply. 
Jen-B worried as Caesar removed 
his shoes. 

Caesar glanced up the first leg of 
the course. Four years was a long 
time. Just the sight of the slope 
tired him. 

“Pulse one-forty and he hasn’t 
even started,” said Tapper. 

He started jogging slowly. One 
minute. Two. He still felt okay. 
He stretched out his pace a little 
more briskly. 

“S-T down, zero point one 
mv — ischemia,” said Tapper. 

Caesar felt a slight squeeze in his 
chest. He slowed to a walk. 

“Walking now. S-f down zero 
point two mv,” said Tapper. 

“He’ll start running again. He 
never stops on the course,” said 
Library. Tapper shifted around 
and focused on the open window. 
He couldn’t see the course from 
there. Jen-B watched the cardio- 
gram. The rate was an irregular 
180 beats per minute. Too fast. 
And there were occasional extra 
beats — isolated P waves and QRS 
complexes. The myocardium was 
beginning to get irritated — prob- 
ably a rising adrenalin level. 

The walking dropped his pulse 
rate under 150 and he topped the 
hill. On the down slope he started 
running again. Muscles and joints 
>yarmed up. 

“S-T segment down zero point 



twenty-five mv now,” said Tapper. 

Library frowned at the little 
barrel. “What has he been doing 
the last four years? He is in worse 
condition now than the last time 
he tried to run the course. He has 
no endurance at all.” 

“On the starship he pressed the 
equivalent .of his own weight each 
day,” said Tapper. 

“That’s no good for endurance. 
Why he — ’’ began Library. 

“Heart block. Heart block!” 
shouted Tapper. The cardiogram 
showed, an atrial P wave rate of 
about 200/min and a ventricular 
QRS rate of 90/min. The upper 
and lower cham^rs were beating 
separately. Jen-B sent the scooter 
from its parking place to the Long 
Run course. It swooped down and 
landed across the trail in front of 
Caesar. 

He was standing, wet and pale, 
in the middle of the trail near the 
three-mile pine tree. He had a 
puzzled expression on his face and 
he was scratching his jaw. 

“Toothache,” he said. He didn’t 
seem to be able to see the scooter. 
He suddenly felt profoundly weak. 
He lay down slowly. His face and 
hands went numb and the peri- 
pheral visual field darkened. He 
coughed up some pink foam and 
passed out. 

<<Tl>fYOCARDIAL infarct. 

IVAoot the conducting fi- 
bers,” said the Healer. 

Caesar opened his eyes. The 



44 



IF 




chest pain was still there and he felt 
short of breath. He coughed foam. 
But he also felt wonderful. Drugs. 

“What does this mean?” he 
asked weakly. 

The Healer smiled. “Awake 
now — are we? That’s just fine. 
You’ve just had a three gam 
infarct. A little bit of heart muscle 
died. The vessel that supplied it got 
plugged up. Atherosclerosis, .prob- 
ably.” 

“How serious is it?” 

“Not too bad. It is a small one. 
But it did get the conducting 
fibers. Your atrial and ventricular 
contractions are not coordinated. 
That should clear up in a couple of 
weeks.” said the Healer. 

“If it doesn’t?” 

“We have a Genetic Carbon 
Copy heart we can put in.” said the 
Healer. 

“Eye — a GCC eye. That’s what 
I’m having. Not a heart,” said 
Caesar. 

“An eye and a heart too — if you 
need it,” said the Healer. ^‘The 
Organ Banks checked with us 
yesterday. They have just about 
anything you can possibly need — 
all GCC.” 

Caesar was puzzled. “But all I 
paid for was the eye — ” 

The Healer patted him on the 
shoulder. “You rest now. You’ve 
already been here three days. I’ve 
cut down your sedatives. 
Tomorrow you’ll be up in the chair. 
And — oh yes. Don’t worry about 
the GCC cost. If you use the heart 



and the eye they’ll refund about 
zero point twenty-eight mf.” 

Caesar slept. He dreamed of a 
little red-headed boy chasing a 
ball. Chasing and catching the 
ball. The boy had two eyes. Two 
eyes and a heart. - 
The next morning Tapper was on 
his bedside table when he awoke. 
“How is the wandering pace- 
maker of three-o-nine?” 

Caesar puffed up his pillow and 
stared at Tapper. 

“Does this mean I’ll loose Jen- 
B?” he asked. 

Tapper hesitated before 
answering. “Up to now the answer 
to that is — not yet. The Academy 
went through the list of their recent 
graduates last night. No one 
matched Jen-B as well as you— in 
your present condition. If you 
improve they expect you to con- 
tinue to operate at a profit. If you 
don’t — ” 

He left the obvious unsaid. Dead 
or a cripple. It amounted to the 
same thing. He’d be left here and 
Jen-B would be matched with a 
younger and healthier human. 

The Healer came in with 
Library’s remote unit — the three- 
inch disc. He fastened it to 
Caesar’s pajamas. 

“Wear this. When it says 
walk — you walk. If it says lie 
down — you lie down. Today you 
walk to your chair and sit there for 
fifteen minutes. Do that twice in 
the morning and twice in the after 
noon.” 



THE BEAST OF 309 



45 




Caesar sat up and hung his feet 
over the side of the bed. Then he 
got up easily arid walked to his 
chair, 

“My heart. The chest pain is 
gone.’" 

“Don’t let that fool you. It was a 
three-gram infarct. Right on the 
conducting bundle. Heart block is 
still present. Just do what you’re 
told.’’ 

“About my GCC eye. Why 
would a GGC heart be available 
along with it — and at a lower 
cost?’’ 

Healer shrugged, “I don’t know 
too much about these genetic pro- 
jects. Different specialty. But their 
prices do reflect the actual costs. 
Must be cheaper to grow the eye 
with a heart than without it."’ 

Caesar noticed that the heart 
refund was ominously close to the 
size of his own legacy. He tried to 
recall what the paramed had said 
when he had been explaining the 
Genetic Carbon Copying ‘ process 
— something like growing the em- 
bryo until it is large enough to 
harvest the transplant. How large? 
Four years? An icy sensation 
closed on his chest. He shuddered, 

“Tapper?’’ he asked apprehen- 
sively. “Do you have a complete 
description of the legacy-leaver’s 
injuries? Was his left eye — ” 

“Missing?’’ said Tapper. “Yes. 
Penetrating injury during the 
explosion. His eye was removed at 
the Tietze Station prior to his 
coming here.” 



Then Caesar realized exactly 
what he was. 

“Cardiac arrest! Cardiac 
arrest!” shouted Tapper. Caesar’s 
cardiogram rail flat — isoelectric 
with ineffectual haphazard 
fibrillation. An electric shock 
restarted the heartbeat twice but it 
stopped again. He heard the sounds 
of hurrying footsteps in the outer 
hall. Then he heard nothing. 



C AESAR became aware of 
blackness. He was in bed — 
flat, soft— no toys. Face bandaged. 
Eye? He tried moving his right eye 
and felt an ache in the left socket. 
The Jeft eyelid was filled out with 
something soft and warm — lighter 
than his prosthesis. Lighter and 
tender. The GCC transplant? 
When he tried to take a deep 
breath to speak, all he could pro- 
duce was a squeak. Left chest pain 
limited his inspiration. It was not 
the squeezing, substernal pain of 
myocardial infarct. It was differ- 
ent — more localized to the ribs 
and muscles. Cautiously he pal- 
pated his left chest — another band- 
age. 

“Oh, no — ” he mumbled. 

“Are you awake?’’ asked 
Tapper’s tinny voice. 

Caesar caught himself before .he 
asked what happened. He knew. 
His own heart must have stopped 
and his GCC heart was put into his 
chest. The GCC eye too. Damn 
efficient, he thought cynically. His 



46 



IF 




own body had been repaired with 
antigenically perfect organs — per- 
fect because they had come from 
his Genetic Carbon Copy. Only — 
he knew that somewhere a little 
four-year-old GCC was without 
those organs today. His naked 
nucleus had grown into a child — 
just as he had when The Beast had 
needed a new eye. The difference 
this time was that Caesar had 
needed a heart too. This would 
leave the four-year-old nonviable. 
No need for a legacy. Caesar 
would be getting a refund. 

Jen-B was shocked by the level 
of depression that Caesar’s read- 
outs reflected. She prodded Tap- 
per. 

“Hi, there,’’ shouted Tapper 
cheerily. “Your seeing-ey e-cap is 
right here beside me. Try it on. 
Take a look outside. It is a nice 
sunny day. You have been sleeping 
for almost two days.” 

Nothing. Schizoid encephalo- 
gram pattern. Jeri-B almost left 
her orbit. Was she losing her hu- 
man? Tapper felt her nagging 
commands. 

Days turned to weeks. 

Nothing. 

“Have a drink,” sang Tapper. 
He danced on his little legs to 
shake the table. The table moved 
and the ice rattled invitingly in 
the glass. Caesar stirred. Ex- 
ploring the table top he found his 
cap- and set it on his head. Spiny 
electrodes tickled his scalp, pro- 
ducing a Rorschach of colored 



amorphous blobs to appear in his 
visual cortex. The bandage pre- 
vented some of the electrodes 
from reaching his skin. He pressed 
the cap down firmly and an image 
appeared for a moment. He saw 
Tapper’s welcome barrel shape 
on his bedside table. There was al- 
so a tall object — the drink. He 
reached for it. His encephalogram 
ran smoothly as his fingers closed 
on the cold, moist cylinder. 

The cap shifted and the room 
disappeared. He pressed it down 
again and the wall came into fo- 
cus. The window was bright. A 
blob moved past the window — a 
small round blob. A larger blob 
followed. 

He turned away. 

“Bandages come off today,” a 
voice said curtly. “Still not talking? 
Well, you can’t fool us, Caesar. 
We can see from your brain waves 
that there is nothing wrong — ex- 
cept a bad case of stubbornness.” 
The bandages were unwound. 
“When you feel like it you can 
open your eyes any time.” 

Caesar knew what he would 
see — two well-matched eyes — wet 
eyes — living eyes. He glanced de- 
jectedly into the mirror held by 
the paramed. He took a moment 
to focus — but there they were — 
two eyes. 

He said nothing. He glanced 
sadly at his chest. The long thin 
incision was healing well. The 
cross-marks left by the sutures 
were hardly visible. 



THE BEAST OF 309 



47 




“Oh don’t worry about your 
heart. We fixed that too,” said the 
paramed proudly. 

Caesar winced 

“Got those coronaries pretty 
well reamed out. Implanted two 
extra arteries into the heart mus- 
cle, too — your mammary arteries 
are now going to help your heart 
muscle recover — but you’ll have 
to do a lot — ” 

Caesar interrupted the para- 
med’s ramblings. “No heart trans- 
plant?” 

“I guess not. You didn’t need it. 
Your infarct was pretty small 
and — Say, you’re talking. Glad to 
hear you.” 

The paramed gathered up his 
dressings tray and left. _ 

Caesar smiled for a moment. If 
he still had his own heart — then his 
GCC was probably still alive. But 
without an eye. Tapper hummed 
placidly. He couldn’t blame JemB 
or Library for allowing the GCC 
transplant. Business ethics. The 
purpose for the GCC’c existence 
was ^to supply autotransplant tis- 
sues. To everyone in Organ Banks 
the GCC projects probably had 
no human rights until they ful- 
filled the business ethic. Then, if 
viable, they became human 
beings — orphans. Naked nuclei 
with a legacy. 

Naturally Library had no rec- 
ord of his childhood prior to enu- 
cleation-^Little Caesar’s exis- 
tence began on the day he lost his 
eye. On that day he paid off his 



debt — the price for existence — 
and “went it alone.” 

H ealer saw him a few more 
times— prescribed a program 
of endurance exercises on a bed- 
side bicycle-ergometer. Caesar 
pedaled against calibrated in- 
creases in resistance until he 
could maintain an oxygen con- 
sumption of 400 ml/min. He re- 
mained sullen and refused to look 
at the window. The sounds of 
children playing wore him down. 

“Take me back up to Jen-B,” he 
asked. 

Tapper brightened. “All taken 
care of. As soon as you’re ready. 
Healer has filed duplicate orders 
with us. You can convalesce just 
as well in space.” 

Better, thought Caesar. As he 
walked to scooter he stole a glance 
at the playground and saw him- 
self. Same red hair, freckles — and 
the ball. The left eye patch and the 
disobedient ball. Tears filled 
both of Caesar’s eyes. 

“Anywhere special you want to 
go? asked Jen-B cheerily. 

Caesar settled back in his couch 
and closed his eyes. 

“Let’s go as far away as we 
can — try for duty -out the Orion 
Arm,” he said. 

He knew he was leaving his four- 
year-old Genetic Carbon Copy be- 
hind — in the capable hands of Li- 
brary. 

Caesar had become the new 
Beast of 309. •

The Great Zambesi was 
pure gold underneath — on 
the outside he was rotten! 

R.A^LAFFERTY 

C HARLES CHARTEL was disappearing act. It was nothing 
not the most pleasant man in really startling; he seemed to 
the world, and as the Great underplay it. But it was puzzling 
Zambesi he was not the greatest and it remained a puzzle even to 
magician. But he was a smart man those in the trade. This one prime 
and a good magician. He had the trick, equated him with the Real 
magnetism of a faith healer, the Masters who in general technique 
spirit and appearance of a rooster were a little out of his class. Actu- 
and a deadly seriousness. He had ally, in the ultimate variation of it, 
the patter and the poise and he had it was the greatest trick, 
learned all that was learnable. He put Veronica into a box. 

Nor was he a mere pigeon-passer And when he opened the box again 
and card-caller. He had inherited, she was gone. That is all there was 
built up, bought and assembled as to it. The same thing had been per- 
full a repertoire as any Magic Man formed by dozens of others in 
in the business. many variations. 

And, as each must have, he had But Charles (the Great Zambesi) 
his specialty: a simple and sound Ghartel did not use any of those 



49 




variations; not, certainly, the trap 
door — for he had once performed 
the trick in a wire mesh twenty feet 
in the air. Besides, he was a cut 
above the trap-door men. 

After showing the empty box he 
would always take it apart board 
by board, and pass the boards 
around for all to handle. He would 
then assemble it once more into a 
box, clamp down the cover, un- 
clamp it again, open it, and 
Veronica would get out of the box. 

The Great Boffo swore that the 
girl never stepped into the box at 
all. The Great Buffo, however, 
could not duplicate the trick. Nor 
could the Great Thaumaturgos, 
nor the Great Zebdo. 

All of them could make girls dis- 
appear from boxes, 6T course, and 
could do it in more showy fashion. 
But, though it was the same thing 
to the audiences, it was not the 
same thing to themselves. Their 
tricks were known to each other 
and were obvious to any magic 
man. The special trick of Zambesi- 
Chartel was not understood and 
this gave him stature. The only 
men in the world who do not 
secretly believe in magic are the 
magicians, but there was some- 
thing about the doings of the Great 
Zambesi that sowed doubt in 
them. The Great Vespo, indeed, 
claimed that he knew how it was 
done. But Vespo, though brillant, 
was an old man and was given to 
extravagant claims. 

The explanation that Charles 



(the Great Zambesi) Chartel gave 
to his audiences will not be given 
here. Should we repeat it, we 
would not be believed; we would 
be laughed at — and we are sen- 
sitive. We have not the magnetism 
of Zambesi to carry off such an 
outlandish claim as his even 
though it should be true — and it 
was. (Actually he said that he sent 
Veronica down into the Ocean and 
that he called her back again from 
that Ocean!) 

However, this isn’t about the 
disappearance of Veronica; it is 
about a matter quite the opposite. 
And the opposite of the disappear- 
ance of Veronica was the appear- 
ance of someone who differed 
from her as much as possible. 



T his carfie about at the Tri- 
State Fair when the New Are- 
na was quite new. The crowd was 
spirited and the Great Zambesi 
was in full form. The lighting was 
perfect and Veronica shone like a 
jewel set in gold as she stepped in- 
to the box that was set up on 
blocks, clear of the stage. Zambesi 
closed the box and the crowd had 
the true feeling of magic about to 
happen. 

And then, with perfect timing, 
Zambesi-Chartel threw back the 
front cover as to reveal the 
box — empty. 

We will be hornswitched if that 
box was empty! 

But what rolled out of the box 



50 



IF 




was not Veronica. It was the most 
woebegone scarecrow of a clown 
ever seen, the saddest looking man 
who ever stumbled over his own 
two feet. 

“Holy hamadryads, cramoise, 
where did you come from?” Zam- 
besi-Chartel breathed without 
understanding his own words. 

The man out of the box was a 
hobo from a hundred years ago. 
He wept and wiped his nose with 
his hand. He had trouble with 
falling pants and broken shoes and 
a coat whose sleeve avoided arm. 
The little clown was good and there 
was real pathos in his silent humor. 

“You’ve got to get out of here, 
cnaufer,” Chartel hissed at the 
little man again and again. “Who 
are you and how did you'get here? 
Off with you now, cathexis, you’re 
fouling up the act.” But the little 
man avoided Chartel who would 
have killed him in all sincerity. 

Finally Chartel in his despair 
closed the box loudly, then open- 
ed it again and brought Veronica 
out of it. But that didn’t get rid of 
the little tramp. He was still 
cavorting about the stage and he 
was good. Listen, he was dressed 
in old black pants and a torn 
undershirt and one suspender and 
he walked about the stage. Then he 
had on a red sweater and a 
burglar’s cap and black glasses. He 
still walked about the stage and 
suddenly he was splendid in even- 
ing clothes and monocle. Nobody 
had done that before. 



He became Joe College; he be- 
came the man in the charcoal-tan 
suit; he became an old rowdy-dow 
on the loose with pearl-gray vest 
and yellow gloves. Then he be- 
came a hobo again — but of a 
different and worse vesture than 
before. 

“Go away, cistugurium,’’ 
Veronica whispered angrily, 
“please go away. You’re not 
supposed to be in the act. Who are 
you anyhow?” 

Nobody else had ever com- 
pletely changed his garb six times 
in a minute and a half while 
hobbling about the stage with his 
hands in his pockets. Nobody else, 
transmuted his shoes from brown 
to black as he walked in them. The 
expression of the little rnan was 
pathetic and many eyes misted as 
they watched him. 

Then, before the act had begun 
to drag, the little man wobbled 
over and fell flat on his face in the 
box. Zambesi-Chartel closed it and 
stood poised over it in an intensity 
of fear and hope. Then he opened 
the box again. The little man was 
gone. 

Zambesi-Chartel took the box 
apart board by board and he left it 
apart. Well, it had been a good act^ 
with an added element.. But 
Charles (the Great Zambesi) 
Chartel didn’t know how he had 
done it this time — or if he was the 
one who did it. The trick had 
'always been to make Veronica dis- 
appear and appear; there sure 



THE MAN UNDERNEATH 



51 




hadn’t been any little clown in the 
act before. 

“Damn that cressanges any- 
how,’’ Chartel grumbled. He was 
puzzled. He knew that little man — 
and yet he didn’t. 

L ater that night at the Pep- 
' perpot some of the people ate 
and talked. There were Chartel 
himself and Veronica; there was 
Captain Carter who had the train- 
ed bears; there were the three 
Lemon sisters, Dolly, Molly, and 
Polly. Then another one was with 
them — for the little man was 
sitting there and sniffling. He 
hadn’t been there before and he 
hadn’t come in. 

“Shall I order for you, claud?’’ 
Molly Lemon asked solicitously. 

But a filled plate was already 
there and the little man began to 
eat. He grinned and he grimaced. 
He was wearing horn-rim glasses 
and then he was wearing pince- 
nez. He had a grin that came shyly 
as though he were trying it out for 
the first time. 

“clarence is so cute,’’ said Dolly 
Lemon. “We will adopt him into 
our act if Chartel doesn’t want 
him.’’ 

There was an empty five-cigar 
carton on the table. The little man 
picked it up and it was full. Well, 
Chartel could duplicate that; 
probably you could yourself, but 
it would take prop and prepara- 
tion. The little man pulled a sto- 
gie from the carton, puffed on it 



and it was lit. This also could be 
done; there are few tricks that can- 
not be duplicated. 

“If you are joining the act, 
cletus, and it seems as though you 
are,’’ said Chartel wondering, 
“you will have to clean up a little.’’ 

“Must 1 really?’’ asked curt but 
he obliged at once. He had become 
as immaculate a dandy as anyone 
ever saw. “Captain Carter,’’ he 
said, “1 see from your pocket bulge 
that you are a drinking man. I ask 
you to share it with us.’’ 

“It’s empty an hour since,’’ Cap- 
tain Carter muttered sadly. 

“It wasn’t always empty,’’ said 
cylix, the little man. “Let me see if 
I can restore it.’’ 

“The last time a magician filled 
an empty whisky bottle for 
me — and it was none other than old 
Zambesi-Chartel here — the stuff 
was not potable. It was the most 
horrendous rock dew ever dis- 
tilled.’’ 

“This will be potable,’’ said 
celiter — and the bottle filled. 

Its content was gloriously pot- 
able. It put new life into the party 
and all of them, except Chartel- 
Zambesi, had a wonderful time. 
And if you don’t think you can 
have fun with a reanimated bottle 
of whisky and Veronica and the 
three Lemon sisters you must have 
a different and more staid def- 
inition of fun. 

ii'DUT all good things must 
-Oend,’’ said Captain Carter 



52 



IF 




when the small hours were half 
grown. 

“All good things do not have to 
end,” said cajetan, the little man, 
who had been enjoying himself on 
Polly Lemon’s lap. “The world 
shriveled when your thought was 
first put into words. Good things 
can go on forever, except 
that — now and then — they must be 
temporarily adjourned. As long 
as we understand that partings are 
only temporary.” 

“Oh, we understand that, cuil- 
ler,” said the, three Lemon sisters. 
So they temporarily adjourned the 
party. 

But later — and this was after the 
sun itself was up — Chartel and 
cyprian were finally alone. 

“We will have to have an expla- 
nation,” said Chartel. “Who are 
you?” 

“You have no idea, Charles? Did 
you not take me out of the box? I 
thought you would know. Did you 
not call me up?” 

“I doubt I did. Do not try to 
hoax an old hoaxer. Where did 
you come from that first time? The 
stage was not trapped and you 
were not intruded with my knowl- 
edge.” 

“Was I not? You told the audi- 
ence how it was done. You said 
you .called me up out of the 
Ocean.” 

“That is my patter — but it 
doesn’t apply to you. Dammit, 
ching-chi, where’d you get the 
Chinese robes and grow that little 



beard so fast? And how do you 
make them both change colors so 
neat? No, chawan, I never called 
any such fish as you out of the 
Ocean.” 

“In that case I will leave, since I 
am here through a misunderstand- 
mg. 

“Stay a bit, cyfaill. In my patter 
that is the way I make the girl dis- 
appear. How could it make you 
appear?” 

“Charles, I’ve heard you ex- 
plain the principle dozens of times. 
I was not in the box. But in a little 
while 1 would be in the box. So we 
adjust the box to a near moment in 
the future and I am in the box.” 
“There’s a lacuna in your logic, 
clunis,” Chartel said. “Hey, how 
can you turn into a Hottentot so 
easily? And not into a real 
Hottentot either, coya — but into 
what I would call an old burlesque- 
stage idea of a Hottentot.” 

“You always did have a good 
imagination, Charles,” said 
chabiari. He took up an empty 
glass, shook it, and it was filled 
again. 

“You’re my master there, 
cosmos,” said Chartel. “I couldn’t 
duplicate that without props and 
you’ve done it three times. How?” 
“By our own theory that we 
worked out so long ago, Charles. I 
shift it only a little in time and it is 
done. Anything that has once been 
full can be filled again by taking 
it back to the time of its plenitude.” 
“Chester, you have a patter that

won’t quit. But, if it worked — the 
idea would be a good one.” 

“It does work, Charles. I 
thought we knew that. We have 
used it so long.” 

“You talk and talk, collard,” 
said Chartel. “But I still do not 
know how you can change your 
whole appearance so easily and 
often.” 

“Why, Charles, we are prote- 
an,” said coilon. “That is the sort 
of man we are.” 

I T WAS later the same day that 
Finnerty, the manager of the 
show, spoke to Chartel about the 
little man. 

“Your brother from the old 
country has put new life into the 
act,” he said. “Keep him in it. We 
haven’t mentioned money — and I 
am seldom the one to bring up the 
subject — but we can settle on a 
figure. Will it be payable to him 
or to you?” 

“It will be payable to me,” said 
Charles (the Great Zambesi) 
Chartel. Confused he was, but he 
always knew the top and bottom 
side of a dollar. Finnerty and 
Chartel settled on a figure. 

have been taken for 
X my brother from the old 
country,” Chartel told colin a bit 
later, “and I can s,ee why. I won- 
dered whom you reminded me of. 
Oh, stop turning fnto a rooster! If 
you were shaved and combed — 
say, that was quick, contumace! 



The resemblance would be, is, even 
closer. You do look like me; you 
are an extremely handsome man. 
But I did not know that 1 had a 
brother, compuesto, and I do not 
know what country the old coun- 
try is — since I was born on Elm 
Street in Springfield.” 

“Perhaps ‘brother’ is a euphe- 
mism for something even closer, 
Charles; and the ‘old country’ may 
have a special meaning for us. Is it 
not the name for what is on the 
other side of your ‘Ocean’?” 
“columkill, you are as phony as 
— well, metaphor fails me— you 
are as phony; as myself,’’ said 
Charles Chartel. 

Sometimes the little man was 
frightening in his wild actions. 
There wasn’t a mean bone in him, 
and he was almost universally 
liked. But he did act on impulse. 

For him, to think was to act. It 
was good that everybody liked 
him; if they hadn’t they’d have 
hanged him high. 

And always he would multiply 
things. Chartel begged for his 
secret. 

“We could be rich, cogsworth, 
really rich,” Chartel v/o\x\d plead. 

“But we are already rich, 
Charles. Nobody has ever had 
such a rich and perfected 
personality as we have. You still do 
not appreciate the greatness of 
our trick, Charles, though we 
thought about it for years before 
we were able to dp it. It’s the 
noblest illusion of them all. Now 



54 



IF 




we are citizens of an abounding 
world and everything in it is ours. 
That is to be rich.” 

“consuelo, you are a bleeding 
doctrinaire. I did not ask for a 
lecture. I only ask that you show 
me how to make a hundred dollars 
grow where one grew before. I say 
that is to be rich.” 

“I’ve shown you a hundred 
times, Charles, and you look for 
more than is in it. You take a thin 
old wallet that once new fatness. 
You restore it to its old state, 
empty it and restore it again, and 
so you accumulate. But why do 
you want money?” 

“It is just that I have a passion 
for collecting it, courlis.” 
“Collecting we can understand, 
but the true collector will have no 
desire for duplicates. Under- 
standably we might want a bill of 
each size — a one, a five, a ten, a 
fifty, — but we avoid that which 
once we prized — the ten-thousand 
dollar bill. The avid people have 
spoiled it for us. But you have not 
the true collectors’ spirit, Charles.” 
“I have the true money- 
collectors’ spirit, clendon. Why 
cannot I duplicate your feats in 
this?” 

“The only reason I can figure, 
Charles, is that you’re just too 
duck-knuckled dumb — and it 
hurts me to say that about one of 
ourselves.” 

B ut Zambesi-Chartel got a 
new set of ideas when he saw 



the trick that cormorant did with 
an old hat. It was at a rummage 
sale at which charleroi looked in 
out of curiosity— he was curious 
about everything. 

“What a pixie must have worn 
this!” he exclaimed. “What a 
pixie!” 

c held the hat in his hands. And 
then he held the head in his hands. 
It was something like a pixie head 
and it was attached to the body of 
a young lady, cisailles kissed the 
young lady uncommonly about 
the temporal regions and pressed 
her to his sternum — for to him 
impulse was the same as action. 
And she squealed. 

“Not that I mind — but you did 
startle me,” she chimed. “Who are 
you? Who, may I ask, am I? And 
how in pigeon-toed perdition did I 
get here?” 

“You are a pixie, young lady,” 
said dough, “and as such you are 
likely to turn up anywhere. I had 
your hat, so what more natural 
than that I should call you up to fill 
it.” 

“I am only a part-time pixie, 
cartier, but I am a full-time house- 
wife. Supper will burn. How do I 
get back?” 

“You already are,” said 
Callimachus. And she vvas. Or at 
least she was no longer there. 

And that was the beginning of 
the trouble; not for c, not for the 
young pixie lady, but it was the 
beginning of the trouble for 
Charles (Great Zambesi) Chattel. 



THE MAN UNDERNEATH 



55 




Charles knew how it was done 
now. One cannot continue doing 
a basic trick in the presence of such 
a sharpy as Charles Chartel with- 
out his learning it. And once he 
had learned how it was done there 
was no stopping him. 

Charles Chartel was not a bad 
man underneath, but on the sur- 
face he was a rotter. The natural 
complement of healthy greed that 
is in every man began to burgeon 
unnaturally in him. The hard core 
of meanness spread through his 
whole being. The arrogance of the 
rooster became that of the tyrant 
and envy and revenge burned in 
him with sulphurous fire. 

Chartel now had the key to total 
wealth, a key that would not only 
unlock all doors for him, but lock 
them against others. He set out to 
get control of the show. To do this 
he had to break Finnerty, the 
owner-manager, and buy him out 
after breaking him. 

Business had been'good and 
every night Finnerty had a full cash 
box. But before a thing is full, it is 
half full. And before that, it is a 
quarter full. Every night, just as 
Finnerty went to count the take, 
Zambesi-Chartel would play a 
trick on that box. And it would be 
only a quarter full. That was not 
enough to cover expenses. 

Finnerty had never been a sav- 
ing man. He had always trod the 
narrow green edge between 
solvency and disaster. And in two 
weeks he was broke. 



Finnerty sold the show and the 
bookings to Chartel for ten thou- 
sand dollars. It made a nice wad in 
his pocket when he walked away 
from the show that was no longer 
his. 

But the meanness was running 
like a tide in Chartel and he 
wouldn’t let it go at that. He 
emptied the wallet of Finnerty 
again, taking it back ten minutes 
in time. Finnerty felt a certain 
lightness, and he knew what it 
was. But he kept on walking. 

“It’s lucky he left me with my 
pants,’’ said Finn, “if he has. I’m 
afraid to look down.’’ 

A CLOUD came over the happy 
little family that was the show. 
Veronica felt herself abused and it 
wasn’t imagination. The three 
Lemon sisters shivered to the chill 
of a harsh master. So did Carucchi 
the singer, and Cqptain Carter and 
his bears. And c, the little man who 
was the unwitting cause of it all, 
took to staying out of the way of 
the rampaging Chartel. 

For Zambesi-Chartel was now 
avid for praise, for money, for all 
manner of meanness. He accumu- 
lated coin by every variation of the 
new trick he had learned. He 
fobbed by it, he burgled the easy 
way. It is an awful and sickening 
thing to see a good man grow rich 
and respected. 

“But underneath he. isn’t a bad 
man at all,’’ Veronica moaned. 
“Really he isn’t.” 



56 



IF 




“No underneath he is a fine 
man,” said c, the little man of im- 
pulse. “Who should know better 
than I?” 

“Why, what do you mean, 
chadwick dear?” Veronica asked 
him. 

“The same as you. Charles is 
only bad on the surface. Under- 
neath he’s a fine fellow.” 

W ELL, that may have been. 

But on the surface, Zam- 
besi-Chartel sure did get rough. 
He demeaned the dignity of his fel- 
low humans and made them eat 
dirt by the ton. He went on adren- 
alin drunks and thrived on the ha- 
tred in his own bloodstream. He 
became a martinet, a propagandist 
for the Hoop act. He registered 
Democrat. He switched from per- 
fectos to panatelas and from honest 
whisky sours to perfidious marti- 
nis. He developed a snigger and 
horselaugh that, wilted pigweeds. 

“Oh, chiot,” said Veronica, “we 
must do something to save him 
from himself. We are all involved 
with him.” . 

“Who should know better than 
I?” conchy latus asked sadly. 

Chartel began to drink tea. He 
started to call a napkin a serviette 
and to omit every single syllable in 
“extraordinary.” He switched 
allegiance from the noble National 
League to the sniveling American. 
He defrauded his laborers of their 
wages, he used scent, he ate vege- 
tarian lunches, he read Walter 



Lippmann posthumously, he 
switched from Gumbo Hair Oil to 
Brilliantine. Once a character 
begins to deteriorate it goes all the 
way and in every detail. 

Chartel had the Green Sickness, 
the inordinate love of money. He 
obtained the stuff, first by all 
means fair and foul, then by foul 
means only. But obtain it he did 
and it made a sniveling devil out of 
him. 

“But the man underneath isn’t 
bad at all,” Veronica insisted. 

“Who should know better 
than I?” caoine said. 

The Grand Canyon began with 
a prairie dog burrow and once it 
was started there was no stopping 
it. The downfall of Zambesi-Char- 
tel began over a nickle and then 
the whole apparatus came down: 
his wealth, real and phantom — his 
reputation — the whole blamed 
complex of the man. 

It started with a fist fight he had 
with a blind newsdealer over a 
nickel. It ended with Chartel in 
jail, indicted, despised, shamed, 
despondent. Moreover, public 
feeling was strongly against him. 

Chartel was up on more than 
twenty counts of theft and pilfer- 
ing and the nickel stolen from the 
blind man was by no means the 
least of them. He was up on a 
dozen counts of wage fraud. He 
was charged with multiplex pick- 
pocketing- ‘by device not under- 
stood’. They had him on faked bill 
of sale, dishonest conveyance. 



THE MAN'UNDERNEATH

simple and compounded larceny, 
possession of stolen goods, barra- 
try. 

“Looks like we have you on 
everything but chicken-stealing,” 
the judge said at the hearing. 

“We have him on that, too,” 
said the bailiff. “Five counts of it.” 

“You would gag a gannet and 
make a buzzard belch,” said the 
judge. “I’d crop your ears if that 
law still obtained. And if we can 
find a capital offense in all this 
offensiveness I’ll have your head. 
It is hard to believe that you were 
once human.” 

Chartel was shamed and sick of 
heart and felt himself friendless. 
That night he attempted to hang 
himself in his cell. The attempt 
failed for reasons that are not clear 
but not for any lack of effort on his 
part. It is worthy of note that the 
only persons who ever attempt 
to take their own lives are rather 
serious persons. 

“We will have to go to him at 
once, cristophe,” said Veronica. 
“We must show him that we still 
love him. He’d sicken a jackal the 
way he’s behaving, but he isn’t 
really like that. The man under- 
neath—” 

“Hush, Veronica, you embarrass 
me when you talk like that,” said 
ciabhach. “I know what a prince is 
the man underneath.” 

L ittle c went to visit the 
Great Zambesi-Chartel in his 

cell. 



“It is time we had a talk,” he j 
said. ^ 

“No, no, it’s too late for'' talk,” 
said Charles Chartel. 

“You have disgraced us both, 
Charles,” said celach. “It goes very 
deeply when it touches me.” 

“I never even knew who you 
were, little c. You are protean and 
you are not at all plausible.” 

“You called me up and you still 
don’t know who I am, Charles? 
But this was our finest trick, our 
greatest illusion on which we 
worked subconsciously for years. 
We are our own masterpiece, 
Charles. And you didn’t recognize 
it when it happened. You are the 
Magic Man but I am the Magic 
Man run wild. Aye, Charles, he’s 
best when he runs wild.” 

“Tell me, cicerone, who are 
you? Who am I?” Chartel begged. 
“What is my difficulty?” 

“Our difficulty, Charles, is that 
one of us became too serious,” 
carnefice tried to explain. “To be 
serious is the only capital crime. 
For that, one of us will have to 
die — but it isn’t as though it were a 
serious matter. Every man is at 
least two men, but ordinarily the 
two are not at the same time 
bodied and apparent. Now you 
have marred our greatest trick — 
but it was fun while it lasted.” 

Little c signaled to Veronica and 
she came down the corridor with a 
bunch of boards under her arm. 
She was admitted to the cell by the 
puzzled jailor.

IF 




“One of us will have to leave for- 
ever,” coquelicot told Charles 
Chartel. “It isn’t right for both of 
us to be around.” 

“Ah, I will be sorry to see you 
go, chandos,” said Chartel. “But 
who are you? I never could remem- 
ber your name properly and there 
is something weird about that. 
You change forever in appearance 
and name. Who are yoU, little c?” 

“Only that. Just little c. Or shall 
we say sub-c? But we are too clever 
to be hounded into a hole like this, 
Charle§. Remember! We were our 
own greatest trick, even if it 
failed.” 

“What must we do now?” 
Chartel asked dully. 

“A simple transference,” cogne 
said. He was building the box 
board by board. 

“I’m not a bad man under- 
neath,” Chartel sniveled. “I’m mis- 
understood.” 

“No, we’re a fine man under- 
neath, Charles. I am the man un- 
derneath,” said ciud. “Get in the 
box.” 

“/ get in? I am Charles (the 
Great Zambesi) Chartel. You are 
only little c, sub-c, an aspect of 
myself. I will not get into the 
box!” 

“Get in, Charles,” said 
cistercium. “It was a mix-up from 
the beginning. You were never 
meant to see the light of day. The 
wrong one of us has been running 
loose.” 

“I’ll fight. I’ll claw. I’ll rant!” 



“That’s what a healthy sub- 
conscious is supposed to do,” 
cludok said. “Get in!” 

“It’s murder! I won’t go! It’s 
oblivion!” 

“No such thing, Charles. It isn’t 
as though we weren’t the same per- 
son. I’ll still be here.” 

Then little c and Veronica 
shoved the Great Zambesi Charles 
Chartel down into the box and 
closed the lid. In doing so, little c 
became himself the Great 
Zambesi. For, when he opened the 
box again, it was empty. And he 
took it apart board by board. The 
jailor said that he had to have his 
prisoner and Veronica gave him 
the boards. 

“There, there, doll,” she said. 
“Make one out of them. Try real 
hard.” 

And Veronica and the Great 
Zambesi left that place. 



W E WON’T say that Zambesi 
wasn’t the greatest magician 
in the world. He may have become 
the greatest, after he^ began to 
treat it lightly. People, he was 
good! There was never any act with 
such variety and fun in it. After his 
strange mid-life hiatus he achieved 
new heights. 

“And I’m certainly glad you 
overcame your personality diffi- 
culties,” the loving Veronica told 
him later. “For a while there — 
whoof! But r always knew you 
were a fine man underneath.” •

Dear Ejler: 

If your writers will write stories with 
English settings, they ought to learn 
the English usage in the words "will," 
"shall," "would," and "should." Mr. 
Benford, in "3:02 P.M., Oxford" IF. 
Sep.-Oct., 1970, pp. 97^107, I83ff) 
does it consistently wrong. 

Kaor, 

L. Sprague de Camp 

The British do the same to us. 

Dear Sir: 

In spite of doing a lot of reading, I 
rarely take the time to write about 
what I have read. I feel compelled to 
make an exception, however, and 
comment on Pinon Fall by Michael 
Bishop in the Oct-Nov. Galaxy. The 
delicately haunting theme of this 
story remained with me long after I 
had finished reading it — not a com- 
monplace occurrence. 

The writer shows a sensitivity of 
expression and a talent for original de- 
scription not frequently encountered. 
I can still see "camels standing the 
snow." I look forward to reading 
more by Mr. Bishop.

Dear Mr. Jakobsson, 

To comment your four magazines: 

Blish's short novels are great. The 



latest in his Black Easter series was 
good, but I anticipated the punch 
line. 

My god! The Heinlein Serial is in 
Five parts? [No, four -Ed.] That 
means another six months. Will you 
go hack on monthly schedules again? 
[Galaxy is monthly again- Ed.] 

IF is good too. Davidson, Garett, 
Eisenberg, Niven. It’s great. How 
about having Van Vogt go outside the 
Silkies series. Step this up to monthly. 
Semi monthly. Weekly. I’ll buy it. 

Worlds of Fanasy was excellent. Del 
Rey’s story was as good an anything 
he ever wrote. All the shorts were very 
good to excellent. Walker between 
the Planes was good, but Norton was 
unreadable (but then, I don’t par- 
ticularly care for Mrs. Norton). 
Schedule this regularly. 

Loomis in WOT good, Laumer very 
good. Smith good. All the shorts very 
good to excellent, except for Bridge. 
It was mediocre as a story and some- 
what smutty (don’t tell me about 
imagery.) Step this up to a regular 
schedule. 

Ratings (on scale of ten) Galaxy 9.1 , 
If 8.6, Worlds of Fantasty 9.8, and 
WOT 6.9. On the average fairly high, 
but WOT would have scored higher if 
you had left out Bridge, and gotten 
some good artwork. 

Artwork is my beef. Gaughan is 
good, but you’re overloading him. 
How about Finlay, or Rotsler. You’re 
peaking the ten-year cycle. Take ad- 
vantage of it. Universal looks big 
enough to get some decent distribu- 
tion. Good luck. 

Hopejully,

BENEATH 
STILL WATERS 

The alien knew a humanity 
that humans had forgotten . 



MICHAEL G. CONEY 



1 FIRST met Ralph Streng dur- 
ing Finmouth Race week. 

I was sitting in the lounge of the 
Hoversail Club, scotch-and-dry in 
hand and conscious of that 
dreamy, relaxed sensation of 
well-being which is half the enjoy- 
ment of sailing. It is,^ as they say, 
great when you stop. The 
panoramic, curved window of the 
club lounge gives a wonderful 
view of the bay and it is possible to 
watch a race from start to finish 
without shifting one’s rear from 
the plush upholstery. 

My first race had gone well — I 
have a little Dodger in the 50- 
square-foot class — and I had fin- 
ished third in the second race of 
the first day. The time^was twelve 
noon. I could,smell the lunch sim- 
mering in the club’s kitchens. The 
weather was fine with a fair breeze. 
And I was not scheduled to sail 
again until five o’clock. Plenty of 
time for another drink, lunch, then 
a comfortable afternoon in in- 
teresting company until my race. 

Life was good; the office seemed 
light-years away. 

Conversation was muted; the 
drone of sailing talk was easy, 
familiar upon my ears. I was* half- 
listening to a group nearby, too 
idle in my euphoria to join in the 
conversation but finding the talk 
a pleasant background to my ap- 
preciatioaof the day’s third race. 

“He’ll kill someone, one of tRese 
days.’’ 

Naturally my attention was at- 



tracted as a sharp female voice cut 
through the murmur like a 
titanium keelblade. I wasn’t the 
only one who noticed; conversa- 
tion in the lounge stopped abruptly 
as some fifty people glanced at the 
speaker — an embittered-looking 
forty-year-old in a too-tight 
sweater — then at the race in 
progress to divine who the po- 
tential murderer was. The woman 
looked slightly abashed'as she 
caught my eye; she hastily re- 
sumed a more normal tone as she 
continued. 

“Ralph Streng, I mean. Just 
look at him now, he almost had 
that skimmer’s stern off. You 
wouldn’t expect a physician to sail 
like that — almost as if he were try- 
ing to create trade for himself.” 
She laughed harshly, aware that 
she was attempting to justify mak- 
ing herself the focus of attention. 

“Now, Lucy,” a plump armchair 
yachtsman mumbled through his 
cigar. “You know very well you 
were making a play for him last 
year and got the brush-off. He’s a 
good sailor, the Doc. Taking that 
son of his with- him today, too. 
There’s a handicap for you.” 

“What the hell’s he trying to 
prove?” demanded the woman. 
“Whatever it is, it won’t be at my 
expense. Widowers get selfish; 
they should remarry,” she finished 
illogically. 

The conversation became 
general again as I watched the 
skimmers round the final marker

IF 




and head for the finish. The boat 
with the red-striped sail had moved 
into the lead after an incredibly 
tight turn and obviously could not 
be caught. A few minutes later a 
cannon's boom and a scattered 
burst of applause signaled the end 
of the race. 

I had started my lunch by the 
time the recent contestants 
crowded noisily into the lounge. 
The dining room at the club is, in 
effect, a continuation of the 
lounge; a neat area of white tables 
for four and attentive, jacketed- 
and-tied waiters. The view is the 
same; the sweep of the bay from 
Hart Point to the west merging 
into the estuary of the Fin to the 
east — you can still watch the sail- 
ing while you work your way 
through the remarkably good 
lunch they serve. 

I was dining alone and had been 
the first to sit down — I usually am. 
My wife informs me this is pure 
greed and evidence of my selfish 
nature, but I always tell her there 
is plenty for all and someone has 
to start first. It takes moral cour- 
age to be the first person into a 
large dining room full of predatory 
waiters. 

.Once again I had proved myself 
right for, encouraged by my exam- 
ple, others |Were now drifting in, 
sheeplike. At the next table 
waiters were bucketing Lucy and 
her escorts into chairs. 

“Ralph, darling!” she cried sud- 
denly. “Come and join our table. 

BENEATH STILL WATERS 



Tell us about the race. Did that 
bastard Clarke try to cut you out at 
the marker? Congratulations, by 
the way.” 

A MAN of medium height and 
heavy build was threading his 
way through the tables in our 
direction. “Hi, Lucy,” he 
murmured, inclining his large head 
gravely. “Afternoon, Fisher — 

Zimmermann.” He sat down and 
began to talk sailing, quietly. He 
was an impressive figure even 
when sitting, his powerful neck 
rising from a vast pullover; a'bove 
it a huge mane of gray hair. His 
blue eyes were sharp in a strong, 
weatherbeaten face. 

Naturally I overheard most of 
the ensuing conversation, which 
veered from sailing to fishing, 
biology, medicine and the forth- 
coming visit of the physicians’ 
delegation from Canaral. 

“To study the origins of life,” 
Streng was explaining. “It would 
appear that Earth is a very much 
younger planet than Canaral. They 
are also doing work on cancer 
research.” 

“Do tell me, Ralph,” Lucy 
asked with coy interest, “what do 
they look like?” 

Streng chuckled, a deep rumble. 
“I’ve no idea. It never occurred to 
me to wonder, believe it or not. I 
tend to look on fellow scientists as 
minds rather than bodies. All 1 
know is they’re about our size and 
bipeds. That information, my 

63 




dear Lucy, was supplied by the 
immigration authorities when they 
asked me to put one of the team up 
at Cliffside.”’ He paused, aware of 
the effect of his words. 

“You mean you’re going to have 
one staying with you?” The woman 
squealed. Her hand was resting on 
Streng’s forearm. 

“He arrives Sunday night and 
will be staying until Friday.” 

Lucy was regarding Streng 
through wide eyes. “Oh, Ralph, do 
ask me along to meet him. I’ve 
never met an alien. May I come 
one evening? I simply must meet 
him. Will he be green, do you 
think?” She giggled in a grotesque 
parody of girlishness. 

Beside her, the man called Zim- 
mermann met my eyes, then 
raised his own to the ceiling in 
mock supplication as he lit his 
after-lunch cigar. 

1 paid my .bill and left the dining 
room, glad that I was not able to 
number Lucy among my acquaint- 
ances and resolving that during the 
coming week I would make sure 
things stayed that way. 

Streng interested me, however; it 
was difficult to reconcile the mild- 
mannered but compelling man in 
the dining room with a fiercely 
ruthless racing sailor. He had 
struck me as a man of sound com- 
mon sense, which didn’t tally with 
his disregard for personal safety — 
and the safety of others — when 
racing. Particularly as he had a 
young boy aboard with him. 



At the seaward side of the club- 
house, which is built into a cliff- 
face, a steep flight of concrete 
steps leads down to the club jetty 
where the craft bobbed gently at 
anchor within the shelter of Fin- 
mouth breakwater. I descended 
with the idea of getting a bit of 
exercise after lunch and filling 
Jayne II with fuel so that I 
wouldn’t have to do this at the last 
minute before the race, when 
there would be a queue at the 
pump. 

As I hauled on the rope, draw- 
ing Jayne II toward the jetty, I no- 
ticed Streng’s boat, red-striped sail 
flapping idly, floating nearby. 
Sitting on the foredeck and gazing 
out to sea while he trailed a hand in 
the water was a boy of about twelve 
whom I took to be Streng’s son. As 
Jayne II drifted past he looked 
around and, as his eye followed 
the line of the rope that stretched 
taut to my hand, he turned side- 
ways and 1 saw his face. The eyes 
were slanted, his complexion pale. 
The nose was thick around the nos- 
trils and the ears protruded lumpy 
from the head which, about the 
crown, was curiously flat. As he 
looked at me he smiled, loose 
lipped. 

He was a mongol. I wondered 
what kind of man could take such a 
boy sailing and take further risks 
by sailing dangerously. 

T here seemed to be some 
problem with Streng’s Dodger.

IF 




Maybe he hadn’t had time to 
check it that day as he had 
previously been racing in the 150- 
square-foot Skimmer class. The 
judges, were giving him a rough 
time. 

We were milling about, waiting 
for the gun, when the launch swept 
out from the jetty and stopped 
alongside Streng; apparently they 
had noticed some unaccountable 
drift. 

Now the rules at Race Week are 
strict and the judges meticulous. 
The motor which provides the 
hoversailer with lift must not ex- 
ceed 250cc and must not give any 
directional motion. Forward 
motion of the boat is provided en- 
tirely by the action of the wind on 
the sails as in oldtime sailboats 
and the handling is similar, except 
that the only part of the hover- 
sailer actually touching the water 
is the thin keelblade. Given a 
moderate breeze, the craft can 
move very fast. 

It appeared that one of Streng’s 
vanes had become displaced, caus- 
ing the downthrust of air to 
emerge at an angle; the flippers of 
a frogman thrashed the surface as 
he probed beneath the craft, mak- 
ing adjustments. Strerig’s expres- 
sion was ominous as the other 
competitors, motors popping and 
boats riding easily, tacked around 
passing derisive comments. There 
is something peculiarly comic 
about the appearance of a lame, 
wallowing hoversailer. 



Eventually repairs were 
completed and the judges’ launch 
roared off, the judges giving Streng 
a last, suspicious glance. A brief 
period of jockeying for position 
followed and then the race was 
underway. A tight bunch close- 
hauled for the first buoy. Streng 
was to my starboard, his face set 
in concentration as he willed his 
craft to pull clear of the ruck. His 
son sat quietly in the small well just 
aft of the mast, smiling afid from 
time to time waving at the other 
competitors. 

The breeze had freshened and we 
were moving fast as we ap- 
proached the first marker where we 
were to turn for a long, broad reach 
across the bay to the second 
marker, which signaled a straight 
run for home. Streng tacked to 
bring him closer to the marker for 
his turn, I followed and the rest of 
the pack tagged along, unwilling to 
take a chance by trying some- 
thing different. By now Streng and 
I were a couple of lengths ahead of 
the field; somehow I had felt it 
would come to this. 

I led him fractionally to the turn 
but he drifted to leeward as he went 
about, forcing me to drop behind. 
It was cleverly done and gained 
him a length. He didn’t look in my 
direction — he was staring ahead 
fixedly — but he knew I knew what 
he had done. I felt a surge of blind 
rage but fought it down. There’s no 
profit in losing your temper during 
a race. 



BENEATH STILL WATERS 



65 




In any event, I knew I had him 
on the broad reach because, al- 
though our craft were evenly 
matched, he was carrying more 
weight. I was gaining as we swept 
for the final turn, despite having 
trouble with my equalizer. 

I wonder if seeing me fiddling 
with the controls gave Streng his 
idea. 

The equalizer is a device that 
directs extra pressure into the lee- 
ward side of the craft’s cushion of 
air when the wind is coming from 
abeam, so that instead of heeling 
over she continues to ride upright, 
reaping the maximum advantage 
of the breeze. My equalizer was 
playing up; every now and then the 
boat would lurch perceptibly. 

Nevertheless I was gaining, inch- 
ing up on Streng as he stared fun- 
ously ahead, his thick gray hair 
flopping in the wind, his strong 
jaw set. The son was watching me 
vacantly and I heard Streng snarl 
at him, as the poor lad absently 
trailed his fingers in the water. 

We were neck and neck, no more 
than a handsbreadth separating our 
craft as we went for the turn. I had 
been calculating that there would 
be no need to jib, just a close turn 
around the buoy and a quick run 
for the finish; leaving Streng, with 
his extra weight, well behind. 

I was outside as we turned, 
marginally in the lead. I knew what 
followed was deliberate because I 
was watching Streng’s face. 

His hand was on the equalizer 



control and, veering, his craft sud- 
denly heeled violently. He uttered a 
shout of simulated alarm for the 
benefit of those behind. His boom 
lashed across towards me, the sail 
cracking in a thunderous jib. I 
flung up my arm, received a 
smashing blow on the elbow, felt 
the boats collide violently and was 
thrown into the low well. As I 
pulled myself up one-armed, sick 
with pain, I caught sight of 
Streng’s fierce backward grin as 
he eased his boat into an unbeat- 
able lead. 

I seemed to have lost the use of 
my arm. I thought it was broken. 
Gathering up the ropes one- 
handed I set in hopeless pursuit, 
steering with my foot, senseless 
with rage. 

1 DON’T know exactly what I in- 
tended to do; follow Streng into 
the club perhaps and dispute the 
result of the race with the judges. 
But I wouldn’t have stood a 
chance; for one thing Streng was 
local and I was an outsider. There 
was also the point — and this really 
rankled — that he cut a far more 
impressive figure than I: 1 knew 
that his personal magnetism 
would carry the judges. One only 
had to remember the woman 
Lucy; she could dismember Streng 
from a distance, but once under 
the influence of those deep eyes and 
leonine impression of suppressed 
power and she fawned over him. 

At that moment, however, I 



66 



IE 




could only think of getting to grips 
with the man and Wiping that over- 
bearing confidence from his face 
with my one good hand. 

The cannon sounded with Streng 
twenty lengths ahead. To my 
surprise he continued on his 
course, leaving the club to port and 
making for the wide mouth of the 
Fin estuary. I followed, puzzled 
at his passing up the chance to 
bask in the congratulations of his 
fellow yachtsmen and assuming in 
my ignorance that maybe his con- 
science was troubling him. 

The mouth of the Fin is strewn 
with sandbanks; the boat with the 
red-striped sail was weaving its 
way through and I was closing, 
using Streng as a pilot. To our left 
lay the holiday resort of Fin- 
mouth, beyond which rose the 
cliffs and, now passing out of view, 
the Hoversail club. Further ahead 
the estuary narrowed between 
steep green- wooded slopes, the. still 
water colored with moored yachts 
of all sizes. I wondered how far 
upstream Streng’s house lay; the 
tide was receding and mudflats 
appeared at the water margins. 
Jayne II slowed as we reached the 
narrower reach and I was glad of 
the following wind; I wouldn’t 
have liked to beat against that 
strong current. 

Streng had glanced over his 
shoulder and seen me following. 
His course became erratic and 1 
guessed he was trying to lead me 
aground on a mudfl#. Reaching 

BENEATH STILL WATERS 



forward I winched up the keel- 
blade so that the small rudder be- 
came the only part of the craft 
actually touching the water. With 
the wind behind, this does not 
cause any significant loss of con- 
trol. 

We passed a small village of 
pink-and-white cottages clustered 
about the water’s edge under the 
shadow of the hills and I saw what 
I took to be Streng’s house. Set 
among the trees on the steep slope 
beyond the village, it was the last 
sign of habitation before the estu-. 
ary narrowed, about a mile far- 
ther, into a shallow race tumbling 
from the distant moorland. Steps 
dropped from the house to a ram- 
shackle wooden landing stage. 

By now I was close and saw what 
happened clearly. Streng dropped 
the sail deftly, steering straight for 
the stage and relying on the cur- 
rent to slow him. At the last 
moment he cut his motor, his craft 
sank to water. He jumped to the 
stage, holding a painter which he 
made fast, then turned to assist his 
son ashore. The boy leaped, 
grabbing for his father’s hand, but 
missed his footing. Streng, reach- 
ing and overbalancing, tottered 
with flailing arms and in an instant 
the two of them were floundering 
in the muddy water, drifting with 
the current away from the landing 
stage. 

Handicapped by my injiired 
arm, I made a wide pass in their 
direction, then dropped everything 

67 




and threw a rope to Streng, who 
had drifted near. He scrambled 
aboard quickly, dripping. 

“For God’s sake get the boy,” be 
gasped, plucking at the tiller and 
getting in my way. “He can’t swim. 
Hurry, man!” 

Looking back on the episode, I 
wonder how I restrained myself. 
Streng had smashed my arm and 
made it a near impossibility to 
control the boat. He had taken a 
mongol child sailing without a 
life-jacket. He had been responsi- 
ble for the boy’s falling in. Yet 
here he was giving orders on my 
own boat. Did he think I wanted 
the boy to drown? 

But at the time it was different. 
Streng’s face was contorted with 
fear, the boy was struggling twenty 
yards away and the situation was 
desperate. 

“You’d better take over,” 1 said 
mildly, moving forward. “I can’t 
move my left arm.” 

In a flurry of ropes and legs we 
changed places and Streng, whip- 
ping in the sail like a maniac, 
whirled the craft around and be- 
gan to beat against the wind in 
short, qick tacks. 

“Oh, God— oh, God — ” he mut- 
tered as he tacked swiftly, his huge 
head jerking this way and that with 
each turn, his eyes fixed on his 
struggling son. “It’s all right, 
Tom, it’s all right!” he shouted 
desperately, his voice echoing up 
the wooded slopes. “Just keep up. 
Keep up. I’m coming! Oh, 



God — ” His lips were trembling 
and his hand was bone-white on the 
tiller. 

“Easy, Tom, easy,” I said, lean- 
ing out and grasping the boy under 
the arms as we swept by, drawing 
him across the foredeck, where he 
lay gagging and coughing. Streng 
pushed me aside roughly and an 
agonizing pain stabbed my elbow. 

“It’s all right now, Tom,” he 
murmured, kneeling on the 
foredeck and patting the boy on the 
back. “Everything’s ail right now. 
We’ll soon have you home and in 
bed — Get the bloody boat under 
control,” he snarled suddenly, 
glaring up at me. “Back to the 
house, quickly.” 

Now that the crisis was past, this 
was too much for me. I stood up, 
bracing myself against the mast as 
the hoversail, motor puttering, 
headed aimlessly across the 
estuary. 

“Just who the flaming hell do 
you think you are?” I asked as 
quietly as 1 could manage. “What 
right have you got to give me 
orders after what’s happened?” 

His eyes were frightening, red- 
rimmed. “I said get this bloody 
boat back to the house!” he 
shouted. “Are you blind, man? 
Can’t you see this boy’s a mongol? 
Don’t you know how easily he’ll 
get pneumonia?” 

“No, I don’t know,” I replied, 
with forced, enraged callousness. 
After all, you’re the doctor, not 
me. Maybe you should have

thought of this before you took 
him sailing.” 

He stared at me. Suddenly his 
shoulders relaxed. He blinked and 
his eyes were calmer. “Would you 
mind getting us back to the 
house?” he asked quietly. “Per- 
haps you’d like to come up for a 
drink and I’ll take a look at that 
arm of yours.” 

Obediently I seated myself at the 
tiller. 

44^0 DAMAGE done.” Streng 

1 ^concluded his examination 
of my elbow. “Jarred a nerve, I ex- 
pect. You may get a bit of a 
bruise there later.” 

“Thanks,” I replied sarcastical- 
ly. Streng left to get changed — 
the boy had already been taken in 
hand by the housekeeper, a gaunt 
old maid named, oddly, Sylvia — 
and I relaxed in the deep armchair, 
gazing around the room and sip- 
ping Johnny Walker. 

It was obviously, a man’s room. 
An old-fashioned open fire blazed 
in an untidy hearth and the mantel- 
piece was littered with pipes, 
tobacco jars, paperbacks and a 
glass bottle in which an obscene 
lump of flesh was suspended in 
liquid. More books on the shelves 
which flanked the fireplace; 
mostly medical tomes with an 
occasional adventure story. 1 got 
up and wandered about, my foot- 
steps cushioned by deep carpet. 
The chairs were leather, brass- 
studded and old; the corners of the 



room held assorted items of sport- 
ing equipment — a bag of golf 
clubs, half a pair of oars to which 
was tied a pair of rowlocks, an 
ancient, suicidal twelvebore and a 
pair of tennis shoes which looked, 
if anything, even older. There was 
the walnut cabinet which held an 
astonishing array of liquor, the 
small bookcase with 'the model 
Cutty Sark on top — everything, 
the complete bachelor setup in kit 
form, somehow a little to com- 
prehensive to be true. 

I didn’t believe it. I sat down 
again, this time at the window, 
and watched real life in the form of 
an elderly rowing boat whose oc- 
cupants were genuinely, if abor- 
tively, spinning for bass. 

This room was fake. The stuff 
had been placed there, not Just 
allowed to accumulate but placed 
to create an effect; maybe to con- 
vince Streng himself that he was a 
normal G.P. living a normal, com- 
fortable bachelor existence. 

“How do you like my little 
place?” He had entered quietly and 
spoke quietly, uttering the conven- 
tional words pleasantly, smiling. 
“How about a refill?” 

“Thanks.” I handed him my 
glass. “It’s very — comfortable. 
You have varied interests.” 

He gave me a curious look as he 
bent to fiddle with the bottles. “I 
keep myself amused,” he replied. 
“And Sylvia is very capable.” 

“She looks after Tom?” I ven- 
tured.

He passed that one over and 
made a brief but extraordinarily 
convincing apology for the race 
episode. The man was smooth and 
my temper, which had begun to 
rise again at the sight of him, 
ebbed. After the near-drowning, 
arguing didn’t seem quite so 
important. 

“Tell me,” he resumed abruptly, 
passing me a full glass and sitting 
down, “what were your thoughts 
when you saw me fall in the river? I 
mean, what did you really think? 
Be honest, now.” He grinned 
disarmingly. 

‘4 thought it served you damned 
well right.” 

“Naturally. So why did you pull 
me out?” 

“Because you might have 
drowned, of course. And your son, 
too.” 

“That may be obvious to you, 
but I would like to know the true 
reason why you pulled me out of 
the water.’’ He regarded me 
quizzically, puffing volumes of pipe 
smoke. 

I felt on the defensive, but was 
amused by his persistance. 

“Because I believe in the sanctity 
of human life,” 1 replied. 

“Try again.” 

Damn the man; I felt compelled 
to have another go. 

“Because I feel it’s the thing to 
do, to rescue another sailor in dif- 
ficulties; or anyone else, for that 
matter.” 

“No,” he said calmly, smiling. 



“Because I was scared that if I 
didn’t rescue you — you would be 
on my conscience for the rest of 
my life.” 

“Getting warmer. Do go on, Mr. 
Warren. This is interesting.” 

I felt as though I were taking 
part in an experiment; an impor- 
tant one, from Streng’s point of 
view. “Because,” I said at last, “I 
was frightened that someone might 
see me letting you drown.” 

He laughed, a deep, reassuring 
sound. “Excellent. You’re quite 
right, of course; but it took you a 
long time to get there.” 

“You don’t think of these things 
right away,” I said with sarcasm. 

“We all do just what we want to 
do, Mr. Warren, always. We can’t 
blame a thief for being a thief, or a 
murderer for killing. You wanted 
to save me and at the same time 
you didn’t want to save me. 
Quickly, so quickly you were not 
aware of it, you weighed the pros 
and cons. And you decided you 
wanted to save me more than you 
didn’t want to. It was the least 
unpleasant of the possibilities. The 
easiest way out. You would have 
hated to be branded a murderer.” 
“What about you, at the final 
marker buoy?” I asked. 

“I wanted to win the race. 1 had 
no fear of being caught out, and I 
didn’t know you from Adam.” 
“You’re Just bloody immoral.” 
“Amoral, Mr. Warren. We all 
are but I admit it.” He chuckled. 
Against my better, or moral.

judgment, as the evening wore on I 
began to like the man. He was 
trying to be honest. We sat drink- 
ing scotch and talking through a 
haze of blue smoke while night fell 
outside and the firelight took 
over, throwing crimson flickers 
among the leather and walnut. 

“Have you ever read Canaral 
philosophy?” he was asking, gazing 
into the bowl of his pipe. “The 
immigration people mailed me a 
book, so I wouldn’t drop any gaffes 
with this weirdo they’re sending 
me. It’s fascinating. They’re 
telepathic and, so they say, are all 
members, cells if you like, of one 
overall being. So they naturally act 
for the good of one another. Un- 
like us. Imagine that. No murders, 
no theft, no adultery. A totally 
ethical community.” He laughed. 
“Bloody boring if you ask me.” 

1 smiled. I was becoming attuned 
to his way of thinking. 

T he following day was Sunday 
and, due to the centuries-old 
view of Finmouth Town Council 
that competitive open-air sport is 
sinful, there was no racing. The 
faithful gathered at the club as 
usual, however, and the day was 
spent in practice and tuning up the 
craft for the week to come. Ralph 
Streng appeared after lunch, 
having motored down with the in- 
tention of sailing his second craft 
back to Cliffside for minor adjust- 
ments. 

“By the way,” he said. “Do you 



fancy the idea of coming up for a 
bite of dinner at my place tonight? 
Sylvia’s a passable cook and I 
think you’ll find it interesting; our 
visitor from Canaral should be 
there.” 

I accepted his invitation grate- 
fully; I was staying at a small guest 
house in Finmouth and had found 
the inmates a dull crowd; there 
seemed to be no middle ground be- 
tween elderly women and young, 
noisy families. And I was looking 
forward to meeting the alien. 

I arrived at Cliffside at nine 
o’clock, later than I had intended, 
having missed my way several 
times in the dark, winding lanes. 
Streng greeted me at the door. 

“Glad to see you could make it, 
Arthur.” He was grinning secre- 
tively. “Our visitor’s arrived,” he 
added, dropping his voice. “Not 
quite what I expected, although he 
is a biped.” 

He ushered me into his den, 
study or whatever he called it. 
“Come and have a Tio Pepe be- 
fore dinner. Chandi, meet Mr. 
Arthur Warren, a friend of mine. 
A fellow yachtsman.” 

A wraithlike creature uncoiled 
from a chair and took my hand 
gently. Slow-moving and soft- 
spoken, he stood about six foot six, 
very slender and looking somehow 
pliable, like soft putty. His hand 
was warm and dry to the touch. 

“I’m very pleased to meet you, 
Mr. Arthur Warren,” Chandi mur- 
mured. 



BENEATH ST ILL WAT E RS

“Call him Arthur,” Streng 
urged. “We got on Christian name 
terms last night, after some initial 
difficulty.” 

“Arthur.” The alien sat down 
slowly. He was dressed in a close- 
fitting coverall of silken material 
which accentuated his slender 
form. His features were reassur- 
ingly humanoid. “So you — ah — 
race boats, too. You compete. 
How very interesting.” 

I gathered that the concept of 
sporting competition — possibly 
any sort of competition — was new 
to his way of thinking. He asked a 
number of questions politely, 
listening attentively to our replies. 
Chandi and Streng, I thought with 
some amusement, represented 
completely opposite types. I won- 
dered how they would make out in 
the next few days. 

“We do not compete on 
Canaral,” Chandi was explaining. 
“The necessity does not arise. We 
are a very old race, you know, and 
possibly a little set in our ways. 
Unadventurous, you would say. We 
research, we philosophize — but 
how can we compete, when we are 
telepathic among ourselves and all 
members of the same mother 
body, just as the individual physi- 
cal cells are members of our phys- 
ical bodies?” 

“How about overpopulation?” 
asked Streng. “Surely the real 
basis for competition is the search 
for — and defense of — living room 
and food supplies?” 



“We do not suffer from 
overpopulation. That is a disease, 
if you will forgive me, of Earth 
and similar young cultures.” 

“Euthanasia,” I heard Streng 
mutter. “Do you put your old 
people to sleep — kill them, I mean, 
and — ” he asked with a very obvi- 
ous effort — “destroy malformed 
and idiot children at birth?” 

There was a long silence. At last 
Chandi spoke. “It is too easy to 
destroy, Ralph; maybe that is the 
trouble with Earth. The really diffi- 
cult and worthwhile thing is to 
create.” 

Over dinner the talk turned 
naturally to Streng’s curious views 
on human psychology. 

“It’s all a question of relative ad- 
vantage to the individual,” he was 
explaining as we sipped our 
liqueurs. “To take a simple exam- 
ple — theft. Let us say I see a cam- 
era in a shop window. I can take 
it while the shopkeeper’s attention 
is elsewhere. But my desire to do 
so is more than counterbalanced 
by the fear of consequences if 
somebody sees me. So I don’t take 
the camera. 

“But suppose I found nhe 
camera, say in the street, and no 
one saw me pick it up. Even if the 
address of the owner were in the 
case the chances are I would keep 
it.” 

“How do you explain the 
frequent return of lost property?” 
I asked. 

“Easy. Either the finder doesn’t

want the article at all, or he desires 
the goodwill of the true owner 
more than the article itself. A 
desire for the approval of others 
plays a big part in our makeup.” 
“Don’t you ever experience a 
feeling of obligation to return a 
favor, Ralph?” asked Chandi in 
some amusement. 

“Never,” he replied flatly. “But 
I admit that I desire the approval 
of my fellow men, which is the 
same thing. I’m working on it, 
though.” 

“You may become the next step 
in evolution, Ralph.” I laughed. 
“Homo Independent.” 

He looked at me, huge head 
strong with shadow and deep eyes 
serious in the candlelight. “Who 
knows?” he said softly. “Just 
imagine the truly honest world, 
where no man is held responsible 
for his actions because all men 
realize that such actions are deter- 
mined by circumstance alone. 
Because every man is entirely and 
admittedly a slave to his desires. 
The concept of evil would be 
meaningless. Evil would not exist.” 
“Neither would good,” observed 
Chandi gravely. 

I N THE days that followed I was 
glad to see that 1 had at least 
made some small impact on Ralph 
Streng. Apparently acknowl- 
edging the dangers involved, he no 
longer took Tom sailing with him. 
I mentioned this to Chandi on the 



Saturday afternoon, the last day 
of Race Week, as we sat together 
in the club lounge. 

“Our friend Ralph is in some 
torment,” the alien observed in his 
gentle tones. “He desires to prove 
that, despite all evidence to the 
contrary, the boy is a normal 
human being, capable of taking 
part in normal pursuits. Yet at the 
same time he wishes the boy dead, 
because that is in accordance with 
his strange beliefs. He will never 
speak of Tom in casual conversa- 
tion.” 

Somewhat shaken by this 
outspoken summary I said nothing 
but watched the boats as they 
streamed across the bay. The club 
members had grown accustomed 
to Chandi by now and his presence 
drew few curious glances. 

Streng was racing; lying third, he 
was showing little of the fire that 
characterized his sailing in com- 
pany with Tom. Nevertheless, I 
noticed the red-sailed craft gain a 
place at the turn by a ruthless, 
though permissible, piece of bluff. 
A slight mixup occurred at the 
final marker and Streng emerged 
from the ruck with a clear lead, 
which he held to the finish. As the 
boats drifted in toward the jetty I 
saw oae of the competitors, a 
mild-mannered little man by the 
name of Banner with whom I had 
occasionally had a drink, gesticu- 
lating furiously and quite out of 
character. His boat was undertow. 

“God damn it, man!” Banner

was shouting as the group entered 
the lounge, “you could have killed 
me! You saw what he did — ” he 
addressed one of the group — “cut 
close and jibbed at the turn. 
Deliberate, it was — ” The small 
man was trembling with indigna- 
tion. 

Ralph Streng ignored the shrill 
protestations, pausing at my chair. 
“Hello, there, Arthur,” he said. 
“Care for another drink?” 

Banner hovered at his elbow, 
yelping like an ill-tempered puppy. 

I said I would have a scotch and, 
as Streng turned for the bar. Ban- 
ner stood in his way. 

“I asked you whether you had 
any intention of paying for the 
damage to my boat,” he repeated, 
pale with rage. 

Streng paused, at last acknowl- 
edging Banner’s presence. He eyed 
the small man up and down in con- 
temptuous silence. I don’t think 
there was a person in the lounge 
who wasn’t watching. At last he 
spoke, quietly. 

“My own opinion, Mr. Er — , is 
that if a man is frightened of the 
risks involved, he shouldn’t race. 
Particularly if he doesn’t have the 
financial means to pay for normal 
damage incurred.” 

Was it the supreme confidence of 
Streng or Banner’s palpable air of 
futility or both? I don’t know, but 
I saw a number of people nodding 
in accord with Streng’s statement 
and there was a' general murmur 
of agreement. Beside me I felt 



Chandi stiffen slightly; he was 
watching Streng closely.. 

“Our friend Ralph is a vefy 
powerful man,” he whispered. 
“But he has his weak point. He 
would never believe that the 
average human is too considerate 
to hit him where it really hurts.” 
Banner, almost in tears, was 
spluttering incoherently; a friend 
took him by the elbow, led him 
quietly away and stood him at the 
bar with a large scotch. He took 
the glass and drank automatical- 
ly, eyes still on Streng. 

“Here you are, Arthur.” Streng 
handed me my drink and sat down. 
“Good race, that.” 

“What was all the row about?” 1 
asked curiously. 

“That little rabbit got in my way 
at the final turn and forced me to 
jib. My boom carried his shrouds 
away as it swung over. His mast 
came down. Who is he anyway?” 
He turned, gazing at Banner who 
stared back furiously. “Is he a 
member? I don’t recall seeing him 
before. Not that he has a 
memorable face.” 

“To sum up,” I remembered 
something from a week ago, “You 
don’t know him from Adam and 
you jibbed your boom into him.” 
“Something like that.” Streng 
smiled slowly. “Happens all the 
time, doesn’t it?” 

“Excuse me.” Chandi spoke. “I 
don’t quite understand this. In 
human psychology there is a dis- 
tinction between harm coming to 



74 



IF 




someone you don’t know and to 
someone you do?” 

“There is.” I answered before 
Streng could utter one of his 
theoretical generalizations. “Your 
race, being telepathic and in inti- 
mate sympathy with one another, 
probably wouldn’t understand. I 
can’t really explain it myself.” 

“I can.” Streng jumped in. 
“Look at it this way, Chandi. Giv- 
en a spaceline disaster, my only re- 
action is morbid interest as to 
whether any death-toll records 
may be broken. But if Arthur, 
here, died, I would feel regret at 
the loss of a source of intellectual 
stimulation — ” 

Which was nice to know. 

S TRENG knew how to do things 
well. We had dined on local 
roast duck and a couple of bottles 
of Montrachet. Now we sat in the 
study, sipping champagne in 
honor of Chandi’s imminent de- 
parture, gazing into the fire and 
talking in desultory, well-fed fa- 
shion. 

“I cannot overemphasize, 
Chandi,” Streng was saying, 
slightly drunk, “the selfishness of 
the human animal. Even the emo- 
tion of sympathy is the fear that a 
similar misfortune may befall 
oneself.” 

“Sometimes, Ralph.” the alien's 
tone was soft and slow, tired, “I 
feel sorry for you. How do you ex- 
plain that?” 

“Well, I tell you one thing. 



Chandi; I’ll be sorry to see you go. 
And Arthur here. What time do 
they come to pick you up?” 

The alien glanced at the clock. 
“In about an hour’s time.” 

“Time for another.” As Streng 
rose to refill the glasses the door 
swung open and Tom rushed in, 
ran across to Chandi and clung to 
his knee. He looked around at us 
with his slanting, pink-rimmed 
eyes, then buried his face in the 
alien’s silken clothes. I regarded 
Streng anxiously; it was clear that 
he tried to keep Tom away from 
people; it would be a pity if Streng 
made a scene on this last night. 

But Streng, mellow with wine, 
was smiling. 

“You should be in bed, Tom,” 
he admonished gently. 

“Chandi,” the boy said. It was 
the first word I had heard him ut- 
ter. 

The alien was watching Streng. 
“In all your arguments, Ralph, 
there’s one human trait you’ve 
failed to mention,” he observed 
gravely. “The one saving, 
unselfish trait. That is the love of a 
mother — or a father — for a child.” ^ 
The room was suddenly very 
still. The occasional crackle from 
the fire sounded loud. At last 
Streng spoke. 

“It’s born in iis,” he said harsh- 
ly. “For the purpose of protecting 
and furthering the species.” 

“I must take issue with you. In 
this case that does not apply. 
Earlier this week you explained 



BENEATH STILL WATERS 



75 




mongolism to me — that extra 
chromosome in each body cell 
which makes all the difference. I 
know, and you know, that to all in- 
tents this boy is not a member of 
the species. He and his kind are 
creatures apart. They are not hu- 
man in the accepted sense of the 
word. There is no rational cause for 
you to love him.” 

“Damn you,” muttered Streng. 
“Leave me alone, will you?” He sat 
down abruptly, staring at Tom. 

“No, you must listen to me, 
Ralph,” insisted the alien. “I’ve 
been watching you closely this 
last week and I’ve felt genuine, ir- 
rational sympathy for you, see- 
ing you torturing yourself to 
prove something. To^ prove that, 
twelve years ago when-you lost 
God, you lost your humanity as 
well. And all the time burning at 
the back of your mind is that terri- 
ble guilt; you’re a doctor, but you 
can’t cure your own son.” 

Streng said nothing. He sat with 
his head in his hands as if trying to 
shut out the truth of what he was 
hearing. He gazed at the tum- 
bling, sparkling embers and the 
crimson glow shot his gray mane 
with gold. I took another sip of 
champagne nervously; the acid 
bubbles rasped my tongue and 
effervesced down my throat, 
^Chandi was leaning back in his 
chair, a slender hand resting on 
Tom’s fair head. From time to time 
the boy uttered small, unintelli- 
gible murmurs. 



“But I can cure Tom,” said 
Chandi. 

I T WOULDN’T take long, he 
told us. He gave the boy a drink 
of some thick fluid, yellowish; 
then brought a rectangular piece 
of apparatus into the room, set 
it down and plugged it in. All the 
time he explained in his soft, slow 
tones. 

“The fluid rapidly permeates 
the system and is absorbed into 
each cell. As you know, Ralph, the 
main purpose of our visit to Earth 
was to study malignant cellular 
diseases. You may not appreci- 
ate the connection between mon- 
golism and cancer — but a con- 
nection there is. Both relate to the 
composition of the cells, a study 
which has always interested us, 
back on Canaral; due in part to 
the composition of our own uni- 
que society — ” 

As he spoke he was attaching a 
multitude of electrodes to vari- 
ous parts of the boy’s body. Tom 
lay still on the sofa, watching 
Chandi silently. 

“I came to your house for a 
specific purpose; to study Tom, a 
fact which for obvious reasons I 
was not able to tell you until now. 
There are some subjects on which 
even the hardiest extrovert is 
sensitive. I will now pass an 
electrical charge through Tom’s 
body which will react upon the 
fluid I gave him, an organic sub- 
stance which itself has an affinity 



76 



IF 




to that single extra chromo- 
some — Don’t be afraid, Ralph. No 
harm will come to the boy.” 

He threw a switch — it seemed an 
irreversible action and I no- 
ticed Streng stiffened in his chair. 
Chandi left the apparatus and sat 
down. 

“In about ten minutes you 
should begin to see a change,” he 
said. “Some of the changes may be 
sudden and I must remind you 
that every cell in the boy’s body is 
undergoing partial destruction. Do 
not be alarmed. After all, as I told 
you last Sunday,” here he looked 
directly at Streng, his eyes unfath- 
omable, “it is a simple matter to 
destroy — ” 

Streng did not reply; indeed, he 
hadn’t spoken for a long time. He 
had merely shifted his position 
so that his eyes were on Tom, 
brooding. Heaven knows what fun- 
damental reorganization of con- 
cepts, what tearing emotional 
stress was taking place in that 
strange mind. He looked like a 
man close to a complete break- 
down; his eyes were hollow and a 
tic plucked at his cheek. 

I followed his eyes and pres- 
ently witnessed a miracle. 

Tom’s fingers were changing 
shape. The stumpy mongoloid 
hands were lengthening, the dig- 
its becoming straight, slender. I 
looked at his face, saw the thick, 
small ears becoming finer, the 
lobes distinct. Slowly the nose 
gained shape, and the eyes— The 



brows appeared darkly, like 
Streng’s. The eyelids lost their 
slant, the whole aspect of the 
face became, slowly and wonder- 
fully, transfigured. 

Much later Chandi disconnect- 
ed the apparatus. I don’t know 
what 1 expected; maybe for Tom 
to address us in normal tones. I do 
know I would have been scared stu- 
pid if he had. 

But he sat up quietly, looking 
at us. He stood and went over to 
where Streng was still sitting. 

“Dad,” he said and took his 
therms hand. 

Chandi began packing his 
equipment. 

“He still has the mental age of a 
three-year-old,” he said. “You 
must be patient with him, Ralph. 
He’ll learn quickly, now.” 

1 poured myself a scotch; my 
hand was trembling violently 
and the bottle beat a nervous tat- 
too on the rim of the glass. There 
was nothing I could say and 
Streng appeared to be in a stupor. 
I was relieved to see the lights of a 
car swing down the drive. 1 went to 
the front door to delay the arriv- 
als until some sort of normalcy 
was restored to the house. 

The car .was large, discreetly 
ostentatious. The doors shut 
with an expensive clunk and the 
unnervingly dreamlike sensa- 
tion brought about by recent 
events was heightened by the 
sight of the trio which confronted 
me. 



BENEATH STILL WATERS

One was human, uniformed, a 
chauffeur. “Dr. Streng?” he asked. 

“My name’s Warren,’’ I an- 
swered. “Dr. Streng is inside.” 

The other two were large, pow- 
erful aliens. 

“Alini and Tubon,” introduced 
the chauffeur. “For Chandi, of the 
Canaral delegation and scien- 
tific investigation team.” 

I motioned them in, moving 
aside to allow the huge figures of 
the aliens to tramp past. 

“In here — ” I opened the study 
door. 

Inside, Streng still sat in his 
chair, his arm around Tom who 
was smiling into his face. Chandi 
was moving toward us, carrying 
his equipment. 

“Alini — Tubon,” he observed 
with grave pleasure. “It’s good of 
you to come for me. Obviously 
you have met Mr. Warren. This is 
Dr. Streng, my host. Ralph, meet 
my compatriots.” 

Streng stood automatically 
and, staring, shook hands stiffly. 
I looked in bewilderment from 
the gross, dynamic figures of the 
two newcomers to the slender, 
slow Chandi. They might have 
been different species. 

“I don’t understand,” mum- 
bled Streng, embarrassed at the 
loss of his habitual composure. 
“You’re surely not from Can- 
aral?” His deep eyes widened. 

Perhaps, in that moment, he un- 
derstood. I don’t know. 

“The difference in appear- 



ance puzzles you?” asked Chendi 
lightly. “We are an old race, 
Ralph; cells of an ancient and 
great organism. Cells grow old 
and are replaced. I told you we 
have no population problem 
and no need for euthanasia. I am 
old and will shortly be replaced. I 
shall die before I reach Canaral 
and on our planet another cell 
will come into existence. Don’t let 
it bother you. It doesn’t bother me; 
I am able only to think in terms of 
the race as a whole — and my last 
days have been very well spent.” 

At last Streng broke down com- 
pletely; face contorted in great 
agony and glistening with tears, 
he clutched at Chandi’s arm. 
“Surely there’s something I can 
do. I’m a doctor, surely I can help 
you in some way?” 

“What would it profit you, 
Ralph?” 

“No!” Streng’s voice was a cry 
of despair. “I don’t want any- 
thing! After all you’ve done for me, 
for God’s sake tell me how I can 
help you!” 

Gently Chandi disengaged 
himself and turned for the door. 
“God is an excuse for lesser men 
than yourself, Ralph,” he said 
quietly. “You discovered twelve 
years ago that there is no God. But 
remember that there is still hu- 
manity.” 

He departed, followed by his 
companions, leaving the three of 
us to the long silence of the au- 
tumn evening. •

GEORGE C.WILLICK 

r 

( 



Hi$ boots collected 
stardust, but his eyes 
saw what was real! 



T he carbon-lead door of the en- 
trance shaft broke its seal to al- 
low the entrance of a giant, head- 
less sloth. Beyond lay the great 
dome of the upper edges of the Re- 
tainer and the animal stopped to 
half-size as it entered, dragging 
the last remnants of its plastic stir- 
rups. It moved slowly, awkwardly 
acroFss the smoothness of the great 
machine’s too-warm base plate; 
muffled, stumbling hoofs yearning 
for the firm support of familiar 
sand and rock. The lumbering 
animal had made this pilgrimage 
before, both on summons and 
voluntarily as now. Still, the 
reverent silence of the chamber 
and the knowledge that the 
machine had created its kind from 
the sands inspired awesbmeness in 
the sloth’s being. 

The Retainer flowed silently 
above the humbling sloth, in lights 
and liquids that worked and 
churned. Within itself and its 
multiple duplicates dotting the 
hardened surface of this planet 
were contained the last members 
of a time-deadened civilization. 
Each thing that had lived above be- 
fore the comet sucked life away in 
near collision. Each member of 
the dominant race, each compli- 
menting specie and plant, each 
event in history as finally 
remembered, were here recorded 
and held in limbo . protected for 
the day when natural elements and 
time would regenerate life- 
supporting surface conditions. 



But until that day came again 
The Retainers with their lower 
attendant life-forms would protect 
the world against disaster: cosmic, 
natural or extraphysical. 

The sloth arrived at its 
designated place and waited. Even- 
tually, a communication bar 
lowered. The animal reached up- 
ward to it and began attaching 
each leg into the four circular plug- 
like cups. This completed, the 
sloth hung as one with the machine. 

“Your purpose in entering Sanc- 
tuary?” 

“My sums have indicated that 
the Outmapper McKay is near 
death,” answered the animal. 

“You petition for an alien?” 

“Yes. He has lived long among 
us and honored the laws of Sanc- 
tuary.” 

“An invader has no place among 
us.” 

“Dare we assume to allow this 
event of time to pass without 
retaining something of it for our 
peers?” The sloth felt intense ten- 
sion as his unexplainable devotion 
forced him to push the Retainer. 

The bar was silent as the Re- 
tainer did not answer . nor was 
the sloth released. The machine 
had reached an impasse with its 
programing and had turned its 
functions inward to a higher 
authority. The decision, when it 
came, would be a Martian one. 

R aymond harper pushed 

the palms of his hands down

against the mattress and tried to 
ease the weight on his hips. Care- 
fully he twisted his left leg a 
fraction in each direction. 
Nothing. A little more this time. A 
white flash of pain blanked out his 
vision as his breath wooshed out. 
Harper sank back into the hos- 
pital bed and made a solemn vow 
not to try that again. 

The throbbing slowly subsided. 
Harper resigned himself to the 
fact that he wasn’t one of those 
superhealers he’d heard about. The 
broken leg swung gently from side 
to side under the traction cords 
and looked for all the worlds like a 
rejected stone carving lynched in 
disgust. 

Harper had just passed his first 
night in Speer’s General Hospital. 
He felt badly out of place and 
wished he were home watering the 
lawn or fixing the Jiffy Mealer or 
something. But here he lay, 
lassoed by a busted leg he’d earned 
from momentary stupidity. It had 
been one of those mental slips of 
an instant when the rest of him 
had known better. He had fallen 
from the 6nd of an ore pipe while 
trying to kick a derrick-maneu- 
vered joining section into place. 
Why men occasionally considered 
themselves more formidable than 
several tons of inert metal was a 
mystery to Harper. Damn foolish. 

The sounds of steady , c/ic/c- 
clacking heels told Harper that the 
day nurse was about to descend on 
him. A whiteness with a face swung 



into the semiprivate room, smiling 
that frozen smile of professional 
synthetic understanding and carry- 
ing a tray full of healing delights. 

“Good morning and how are we 
today?’’ And before Harper could 
answer, “Oh, really? Well, that’s 
nice. Here. Let’s take your tem- 
perature.” Harper managed to 
open his mouth in time to avoid 
having his lips impaled. 

Fighting back the inclination to 
go crosseyed. Harper glared be- 
yond the glass rod obstructing his 
vision and was met look for look. 

“Bowels move yesterday?” 

What the hell, lady. 

But he nodded affirmatively and 
ignored images of what might hap- 
pen if he told the truth. 

“That’s nice,” the nurse re- 
peated out of reflex as she took his 
pulse. Satisfied, she dropped his 
wrist and moved to the end of the 
bed where she noted the results on 
a clipboard. The writing took 
overly long and Harper suspected 
she was counting his respiration 
rate and held his breath. “All- 
right,” she said cheerfully and 
dropped the clipboard back into 
place a little too quickly. Harper 
eased out a sigh. She took out the 
thermometer slowly while peering 
down at Harper with that certain 
distaste women have for unclothed 
and unfamiliar men. He secretly 
hoped the glass had grown hair. 
“Well, well. Aren’t we the healthy 
one?” 

“That’s right. I’m fine. In here

for a broken leg. Never felt better. 
Can’t use a thing except a decent 
meal.” It was rapidfire but he got 
it all in. 

“You needn’t worry, Mr. Har- 
per. Breakfast is on its way. You’ll 
find plenty of everything. Now try 
to roll over — it’s time for bottom’s 
up.” 

The nurse squirted a stream onto 
the floor from a hypodermic needle 
gleaned from the tray. 

“What do you suggest I do with 
that?” asked Harper pointing to 
the suspended leg. 

“Just lean over as far as you can. 
And loosen these a bit,” she said 
tugging at his smock. Harper 
freed the drawstring bow. “There 
we are. Now please relax. It won’t 
hurt if you relax.” 

She gave the shot in a jolting, 
stabbing manner. Luckily Harper 
had clenched his teeth or he might 
have bit off the end of his tongue. 
He could see the nurse’s eyes glis- 
ten in delight as an age-old revenge 
was sweetly taken. 

“Now that didn’t hurt, did it?” 
she asked as the cotton swab 
rubbed away a drop of blood. 

“No. That didn’t hurt at all,” 
said Harper in calmly measured 
tones. 

Her smile remained, plastered 
on cast-iron features, but he could 
see her eyes saying, 77/ bet. 

The nurse unloaded several 
small paper cups containing 
multicolored pills for Harper to 
swallow. She then inspected the 



traction supports to ascertain that 
they were not blistering the skin. 

“Simple fracture like this, why, 
you should be out of here by to- 
morrow fit as new.” 

Harper met the smile head-on 
and attempted to attain the proper 
degree of mechanical poise. 

“The doctors will be along in a 
little while to give some more cal- 
cium-silicon treatments. Now, if 
you’ll lift yourself up a bit, Mr. 
Harper — ” 

“For what?” asked Harper de- 
fensively, 

“For this,” said the nurse in a 
flurry of motion. The cold bed- 
pan had moved from the cabinet to 
under him as if by magic. Harper 
gritted his teeth at the contact. 
The smile again. “That’s what you 
get for lying to me. Be good, now, 
or you’ll get more.” 

With that threat she picked up 
her tray and was gone, click-clack- 
ing Aov/n the hall. 

T he other bed in the room was 
empty but Harper had little 
time to be lonely. Crowded and 
overexposed would have been 
more accurate terms of descrip- 
tion. Breakfast arrived and 
seemed closely followed by din- 
ner. In between he was inundated 
by several waves of nurses and 
aides. Harper was washed, re- 
lieved, turned a little, combed, 
rubbed, pilled and needled again. 
There was an interview by a 



82 



IF 




records clerk who extracted his 
life’s medical history and those of 
three previous generations. Af- 
ter that the mop-and-clean-sheet 
brigade arrived. An insurance 
agent for the company put in an 
appearance just to make sure he 
really existed and interrupted a 
nice elderly lady trying to sell him 
magazines. All in all, Harper 
formed a new opinion as to the 
cause of relapses. 

He was visited twice by a team of 
doctors that administered the cal- 
cium-silicon injections. The 
treatment fascinated Harper. 
They used a portable X-Ray de- 
vice that reproduced continuous 
images on a remote viewing 
screen. The plates were attached 
to a yoke-shaped device that was 
easily mobile through 360 de- 
grees and allowed a complete 
view of the fracture. The cement- 
ing action of the last injections 
could be instantly analyzed and 
this made possible an accurate 
diagnosis of where the next shots 
were to be placed. A simple frac- 
ture required only twenty-four to 
thirty-eight hours to repair. Asso- 
ciated tissue that had been 
bruised or torn required a little 
longer to heal but still a patient 
wasn’t down more than a week. 

As the afternoon slowly 
lengthened. Harper began to 
think he was going to enjoy a few 
moments of peace and quiet. A 
sudden commotion in the hall- 
way that increased in decibels 



proved him wrong. An urgent en- 
tourage rolled in a patient on an 
emergency stretcher cart. Har- 
per could see that his roommate 
was in far more serious trouble 
than he. 

The staff attending the elder- 
ly patient moved quickly and 
smoothly. Conversation was 
kept to abbreviated phrases as 
each seemed to sense what the oth- 
er was doing. This was one of the 
crack teams from Receiving and 
none of the usually prevailing 
hospital mystique clung to them. 
They ignored the draw curtains 
between the beds and Harper 
watched, entranced. 

The cart was rolled parallel to 
the bed and two aides lifted and slid 
the patient onto the bed in a 
sweeping flowing motion. A resi- 
dent doctor and intern assisted 
from the other side. The aides 
were pushing the cart from the 
room as the duty nurse arrived, 
smile in place. And for the first 
time Harper could remember, 
the smile disappeared when she 
saw the cream-colored knee boots 
on the patient. 

Harper had noticed the boots 
but thought the patient was still in 
street clothes. He could see now 
that the man was not. The nurse 
started to remove them. The pa- 
tient, who seemed in shock and a 
bit out of it, came groggily aware. 

“What are you doing, woman? 
Get away from , there. GET 
AWAY!” 



THE MIDNIGHT RIDE OF MERLANGER MCKAY 



83 




The man’s right leg swung up at 
the nurse and the momentum al- 
most carried him out of bed. 

The intern caught the man and 
lifted him back onto the mattress. 

Turning to the nurse, the doctor 
said furiously, ‘Tor God's sake, 
let those alone." 

She recoiled and blinked, “But 
the sheets — " 

“To hell with the sheets." He re- 
turned his attention to the pa- 
tient. “Listen, McKay. Now hear 
me! You’ve had a massive stroke. 
Your left side is paralyzed from 
your neck on down. You have at 
least one'-major obstruction in 
your brain, maybe more. I've giv- 
en you shots to attempt to dis- 
solve it — but you\e goi to lie still. 
Any more of that jumping around 
and we’ll be burying you. You lis- 
tening?’’ 

“Yeh, I hear you,’’ said the pa- 
tient whose tone indicated he was 
highly disturbed by the incon- 
venience of it all. “But you better 
tell them girlies to leave my boots 
alone. None of you ground-hop- 
pers are gonna be able to take 
them off— not unless I'm 
dead— and I ain't dead by a long 
shot. Got to get off this planet and 
get home, got to — ’’ 

The doctor administered a 
sedative while McKay talked and 
he and the intern waited until its 
affect sent the man into a deep 
sleep. As they started to leave the 
doctor paused and turned to Har- 
per. 



“Hi. Sorry for the commotion.’’ 
“It’s all right.’’ 

“I’d like you to do me a favor. 
Keep an eye on him for us and if he 
becomes active or anything, push 
your emergency light — okay? We 
may have to strap him down.’’ 
“Sure, be glad to,’’ said Harper. 
“What caused the stroke?’’ 

The doctor shrugged to indi- 
cate multiple possibilities, “Proba- 
bly the results of a drastic change 
in environment. He's a little too 
elderly to be taking the physical 
punishment of a space trip and 
planetary changes.’’ 

“He’s a spacer?’’ asker Harper. 
“That’s my understanding. 
His idenity tags say he’s a Mar- 
tian Outmapper. He had a return 
ticket on him that was sold last 
month on Mars. An unusual man. 
But then Outmappers are known 
for that. I have to rush, so thanks 
again. It will be a couple of hours 
before he comes around. So long,’’ 
said the doctor with a wave of his 
hand. 

“’Bye,’’ said Harper and the 
room was left to its paying occu- 
pants. 

H arper regarded his new 
roommate with increased curi- 
osity and a certain awe that’s in- 
herent in any spectator. McKay 
was old but strangely aged, as 
though sections of his body lived at 
different paces. His torso and legs 
were huge and seemed muscular, 
yet his arms were scrawny sticks.

His face was typical of the spac- 
ers Harper had seen in passing. It 
was heavily wrinkled and darkly 
burned, yet possessing a curiously 
whitish cast, almost as if the skin 
were in a constantly accelerated 
reproduction process. Bulging 
purplish veins traced eerie lines on 
the sunken features and pulsed to 
a steady heartbeat. The only other 
motion was the rising and falling 
of an overly distended chest. 

The oddly shaped boots pro- 
truded from under the blankets 
and appeared bizarre in the ex- 
treme. Their design indicated a 
rare originality. No stitching or 
glued se.ams were visible. The 
overall effect, was almost as if 
they had been poured to form. 
Harper wondered about it for a 
while, until the boredom of the 
long afternoon sent his thoughts 
elsewhere. 

Activity picked up right after 
supper as the second-shift nurse 
arrived to give Harper his antibi- 
otic shot and pain pills. She went 
about her business with much the 
same personal de,tachment as 
her predecessor. Harper pre- 
ferred her, though, since she didn’t 
smile at all. Another calcium- 
silicon treatment was given and 
the X-rays showed that no more 
would be required. 

Harper sighed his relief as dark- 
ness came, knowing that the morn- 
ing would bring his release. He had 
just reached over his head to wave 
on the telescoping bedlamp when 



he noticed that McKay was awake 
and watching him. 

“Hello,” Harper offered. “How 
are you feeling?” 

“Like hell,” came the thickly 
couched reply. “They got any 
water in this pest hole?” 

“Coming up,” answered Harper 
and activated the nurse’s station 
alarm. An aide appeared and at- 
tended to McKay’s needs which 
proved to be several. Harper 
passed the time reading some of 
the bedside literature donated by 
various organizations. McKay was 
extremely 4eak but managed to 
drink most of a specially prepared 
milkshake. The aide tied an emer- 
gency light to the guardrail near 
McKay’s right hand and departed 
after passing chosen words of en- 
couragement. 

McKay’s usable hand fumbled 
along the bedside until he found the 
controls that raised the head sec- 
tion. His eyes seemed to strain un- 
til he caught sight of the boots 
sticking out from under the blan- 
kets. 

He waved the right toe back and 
forth for a moment and then 
asked, “They try to take them off 
me?” 

“Um-hmm.” Harper nodded. 
“But you gave them a bad time.” 

“Yeh — it figures. Them boots 
ain’t been off in over forty years. 
Never will either. Bet they don’t 
come off when they haul my car- 
cass away. Them boots are a part 
of me by now — a part of me.” 



THE MIDNIGHT RIDE OF MERLANGER MCKAY 85 




Harper srpiled but he was cer- 
tain that he had heard only about 
half of that, “You say you've been 
wearing them for forty years? 
They look like new.“ 

The right toe waved back and 
forth again. “Sure they look new. 
Hand-made from gimpo hide. 
Won’t wear out — cant wear out. 
They take life back from whatever 
wears them. Replace themselves 
like skin.” 

“I never heard of anything like 
that,” said Harper incredulously. 

“No matter,” said McKay soft- 
ly. “There’s lots of things people 
ain’t never heard of and probably 
never will, for that matter. Damn 
bunch of ground-huggers content 
to live out their lives in prenatal 
conditions and scared-to death of 
expanding their minds.” 

Harper must have reacted pain- 
fully and McKay seemed to real- 
ize why. 

He immediately added: “Don't 
take that personal, fellow. I don't 
mean it personal.” 

'The name's Raymond Har- 
per.” 

“Merlanger McKay’s mine,” 
“Glad to know you. One of the 
doctors who admitted you said he 
thought you were an Outmapper 
on Mars — that true?” asked Har- 
per, making conversation. 

“I am an Outmapper. Just 
came back to Earth long enough to 
see some relatives but they’ve all 
passed on. Guess I was out there 
longer than I thought. Damn air 



down here’s got me all messed up. 
I’ll be fine when 1 get back home. I 
can live there— shouldn’t have 
left— friends who understand 
things. This world’s harder than I 
remember — cold and empty — no 
friends, none who could be — ” 

H arper gave a courteous nod 
occasionally as McKay 
rambled, falling into remini- 
scence. Eventually a pause 
lengthened into silence and Har- 
per thought the Outmapper had 
drifted off into sleep. But the other 
continued abruptly. 

“What about you? How’d you 
get slung up like that?” 

“Stupidity, mainly. I work for 
Universal Ores as a construc- 
tion engineer. Fell off an ore line 
yesterday afternoon and broke 
my leg.” 

“Too bad,” said McKay, genu- 
inely sorry. “Your company has 
mining projects on Mars, too. You 
ever been up?” 

“No. Had the chance but turned 
it down. The pay was good but I 
didn’t >yant to leave while my folks 
were still alive. Maybe that’s a 
way of saying I didn’t have the 
nerve — I don’t know. Most of the 
men I’ve met returning from a 
tour say it’s pretty harsh duty and 
very lonely. I’m pretty much a 
crowd-follower.” 

“I guess that’s about right— the 
part about its being bad duty. It 
wouldn’t be worth much if you had 
to stay put on some construction

IF 




project, watching camp video re- 
runs. But with a breather, a couple 
of pairs of outtogs and a 
gimpo — well, it’s tremendous. 
You know what a gimpo is, don’t 
you?” 

Harper shrugged and grinned in 
a half ignorant way. “I’ve seen 
pictures of them. They’re the ma- 
jor life form on Mars, aren’t 
they— called the Martian Camel?” 

“The major animal form, yes, 
but there are others. The camel 
bit sounds like some fool in an of- 
fice needing word« to say. A 
gimpo is sort of one thing, you 
know? It has a body and four legs 
but it’s all the same thing. No 
bones or joints or things like that. 
It’s just as if the body runs down in 
four places to make the legs. 
There’s no neck or head. It was a 
real shock for me when I saw my 
first one.” 

“You mean there’s no head at 
all?” 

“Nope. Doesn’t need one. About 
the only head-type feature it 
needs and has is an eye-like vision 
hole up between what we call the 
front pair of legs. Ears, nose and a 
mouth full of teeth would be^ a 
waste of space. They absorb what 
they need through their hides like 
we expel from ours. And don’t 
think that didn’t give us trouble at 
first. We tried to ride them and 
they were peaceful enough but 
they’d eat the pants right off you in 
no time. Finally found an oil- 
based plastic that stayed flexible in 



the temperature changes that we 
used for a halter to yoke the front 
legs. Good halter would only last a 
couple of months at best.” 

“Fascinating,” said Harper. 

“Yeh, I guess it sounds that way 
now. It wasn’t so much then. It was 
a simple case of life and death. 
Either you had a gimpo to find 
water for you out on those ranges 
or you didn’t make it. More like a 
burro than a camel. I guess we 
Outmappers were a lot like t^iose 
old gold prospectors of years ago. 
More than one man owes his life to 
that animal — in several ways.” 

Harper decided that the talking 
was relaxing McKay and keeping 
his mind off his predicament. The 
long sedative-induced sleep seemed 
to have rested the man complete- 
ly and he was keeping still, so 
Harper continued to encourage 
the conversation. 

“How’s that?” 

“Well, like the time I first dis- 
covered a Martian Sanctuary. I’d 
have walked right into it if that 
gimpo of mine hadn’t gone belly 
down in the sand. I pulled and 
kicked but he wouldn’t budge. 
About then. .” 

McKay spun his story freely 
and Harper could feel himself be- 
ing drawn into the web. The hos- 
pital room took on a glimmer of 
fog as both men’s minds narrowed 
to the time line, as the one identi- 
fied with the other and both re- 
traced lost images, the one lead- 
ing, the other following. 



THE MIDNIGHT RIDE OF MERLANGER MCKAY 



87 




**There is no purpose to abuse of 
the beast/* 

The image had spoken behind 
McKay*s back and he spun to- 
ward it with one foot still cocked in 
an undelivered kick. The draped 
figure of a man confronted Mc- 
Kay from behind a barrier of heat 
waves. The Martian plateau in 
coming twilight reflected dimly 
through the figure and McKay 
sensed it to be a projection. Still, 
his only instinct was to flee. The 
Outmapper clamped down on his 
fear and stood his ground. There 
was no place to run without meeh 
ing certain death. If it were to 
come — here was the place to stand 
or fall. 

**Your person is in np immedi- 
ate danger/* the image spoke again 
in the oddly resonating atmos- 
phere. The thing didn*t appear to 
McKay to move and the sound was 
almost non-directional. The fea- 
tures were strangely arranged and 
the clothing unusual, yet there 
was too much familiarity about it. 
McKay was certain the thing was 
for his identification only. 

**What do you want?** he asked, 
unusually calm, considering. 

**It is a strange question. This is 
our home and you are the one who 
wants something. Still, invader, 
we wish you no harm. That is why 
we appear here. ** 

The sound stopped but the mes- 
sage was incomplete. McKay de- 
cided to remain silent and wait. 

The image raised a wavering 



arm and indicated in a sweep the 
land behind it. **All this is sacred 
ground for our kind. You must 
consider it forbidden sanctu- 
ary. To enter without our con- 
sent will result in death. ** 

McKay considered the words as 
he looked behind the image at the 
alien landscape. **The land ap- 
pears no different. I see no indi- 
cations of boundaries. How am I 
to know?** 

**The beast you use will not 
cross, nor any after its kind. ** 

**That doesnt help me,** said 
McKay slowly. '7 could wander 
around on my own or get lost 
maybe/* 

The image passed an arm be- 
hind its back and reappeared 
holding a pair of boots. It bent 
forward and set them down out- 
side the wall of shimmering 
waves. **The coverings are of the 
beast and live long after the ani- 
mal itself has died. Wear them and 
they will become a part of you, 
forbidden to enter sanctuary. 
You will also be able to ride the 
beast unharmed. ** 

The tension of alien contact be- 
gan to wear on McKay. He could 
feel his limbs tremble and weak- 
en, his thoughts stuttered. "I dont 
know — I dont know. .** 

**The other choice,** continued 
the image, **is to leave this place 
and never return. For the shape of 
it is irregular and to return 
would mean death. In time it may 
be that some among you will be in-

IF 




vited to enter and be at peace with 
the elements. But that shall be our 
decision and those selected of 
our choice. Beware. 

The image faded and suddenly 
the lines were gone. The gimpo 
stood and waited, its fur-covered 
skin quivering in the desert twi- 
light. McKay slumped down onto 
the sand and stared at the boots 
and tried to evaluate the degree of 
his sanity. 

H arper could feel his mind 
blink. “So you decided to put 
them on?” 

“Yeh, after a while I did. And it 
was like he said. For years after- 
ward I would walk into places 
where I couldn't go any further. It ' 
took a long time before I got the 
area all mapped out — shows on the 
maps as simply being unexplored.” 
“Some sort of alien design?” 
“Don’t know. Just looks like an 
ink splash on a piece of paper. 
Probably has a reason, I guess.” 
“Were you the only one to meet 
a Martian?” asked Harper. 

“Naw, most of us did, sooner or 
later. There are other sanctuaries. 

I was the only one that got a free 
pair of boots, though. The others 
had to make their own — not that 
they believed the sanctuary story 
so much at first — ^just that they 
preferred riding to walking.” 

“Seems strange that you’d pre- 
fer to walk or ride rather than use 
the automatic transportation.” 
“Eh— Raymond, isn’t it? Well, 



I’ll tell you, Raymond, it’s like 
this. You have to be a loner and 
down on things in general to want 
to be an Outmapper. You don’t 
want to take much with you that 
reminds you too much of civiliza- 
tion. Especially some damn ma- 
chine that’s going to break down 
on you when you’re dependent on 
it. Oh, sure, some tried that ap- 
proach but almost all of th^m died 
up there. I found a wreck one time 
right up at a sanctuary line. It’s 
no place for a kid and a machine 
out on a joyride. You got to go it 
alone on guts and try to get as close 
to old nature as you can, so you’ll 
have sharp and reliable instincts. 
And even at that, most Outmap- 
pers paid the price in those 
deserts.” 

“I suppose Mars is fairly well 
mapped out by now?” 

“Yeh, fairly well. There’s still a 
couple of areas for an old hand like 
me. If I can ever get out of this 
place to get home.” 

It was past eleven and the night 
shift had come on. The nurse’s 
first round of calls broke up the 
conversation. 

“My, my, aren’t we the late ones 
in here? Come on now, let’s be 
turning in. Mr. Harper? That’s 
you? Yes, I have a shot for you.” 

She reached up and pulled the 
curtain shut. 

After tending to McKay the 
nurse left, waving off the lights. 
Harper lay awake in the darkness 
for a long time listening to the 



THE MIDNIGHT RIDE OF MERLANGER MCKAY 



89 




Outmapper’s regular breathing 
and thinking about the harmless 
babblings of the senile old man. 
Funny how it always happened 
to the aged. Talk and talk and talk. 
They’d tell stories for days on end 
about times long past and none of 
them would be true — only half be- 
ing even probable. It seemed to be 
nature’s way of relieving inner 
frustrations that younger people 
expelled in more vigorous ways. 

Harper’s cramping leg finally 
gave up and went numb. It gave 
him a chance to drift off into a rest- 
less and dream-filled sleep. 

A FEELING of gossamer 
touched Harper while he slept 
and he jerked awake, all senses 
alive and functioning. He held his 
breath and listened for any sound. 
There was none. Something had 
happened to awaken him, he was 
certain. He reached out to the cur- 
tains between the beds and drew 
them back. 

McKay’s body lay half off the 
bed, an arm and one foot dangling 
lifelessly. Harper grabbed the 
emergency button but knew in 
the starlight of the bay windows 
that the Outmapper was dead. A 
blankness closed in about him and 
he only faintly remembered 
strong hands breaking his grip on 
the emergency cord. The needle’s 
thrust went almost unnoticed and 
his body fought back the effects of 
the sedative. He had thoughts to 
think and nothing could interfere. 



Every breath Harper gulped try- 
ing to understand the Outmap- 
per’s death had a bit of the same 
mystery in it. They had shared air. 
They had shared life. McKay’s 
last words played over and over. 
His image turned and turned. Hap- 
pens feelings were his own, locked 
up in a frozen exterior from 
which they couldn’t be broken 
loose and shared with anyone. He 
kept thinking over and over again. 
Damn, damn, damn, I don’t un- 
derstand. why does life have to 
die. why? 

Finally, in a stupor. Harper col- 
lapsed on his bed, having changed 
nothing. 



T he rattling of trays being un- 
loaded from the breakfast cart 
in the hallway helped Harper shake 
off the effects of the sedative and 
stir awake. He slipped his leg from 
the traction harness and awk- 
wardly positioned the numb limb 
on the bed. Soon the shooting 
pains of returning circulation 
caused him to roll about in an- 
guish. He was gripping the sides of 
the mattress when a faintly lumi- 
nous mark on the floor caught his 
eye. Then he saw another. 

Harper eased himself from the 
bed and applied slight pressure to 
the injured leg. Satisfied that it 
would hold his weight, he stepped 
to the foot of the bed. A path of 
faint blobs lead from McKay’s bed 
into the hallway. It looked as

though someone had dribbled a 
ball laden with powder. Harper 
limped after them. He ignored 
the stares of the aides delivering 
breakfast and tried to follow the 
prints. They were almost rubbed 
out. Twice he lost them and picked 
them up again. They led him 
through a pair of massive doors 
out onto a sundeck. Here the 
prints showed clearly again. They 
led straight to the rim and ended. 
Harper stood staring dizzily at 
the twelve-story drop to the park- 
ing lot below. 

“Mr, Harper!” It was the smil- 
ing nurse. She came bustling out 
to the sundeck, pushing a wheel- 
chair and was obviously irri- 
tated. “You know you shouldn’t be 
up on that leg without the doc- 
tor’s permission. What are you 
doing out here anyway? It’s time 
for breakfast. Now sit down and 
I’ll wheel you in — come on now — ” 

Something inside Harper’s mind 
shut her out and a hush prevailed 
during the trip back to his room. 

He remained in bed until the 
breakfast tray was delivered. Then 
he arose again and made his way to 
the personal lockers behind the 
doorway. Digging into his trous- 
ers he found his pocketknife. 
Harper liberated a napkin from 
the tray and kneeled near the clear- 
est print and began scraping it 
away from the tiles. He scraped up 
three more before he was satisfied 
he had procured a reasonable 
sampling of the stuff. Folding the 



napkin carefully. Harper re- 
turned to his locker and shoved it 
into a pocket. Then he limped 
back to bed and breakfast! 

The usual rigamarole of check, 
and double check, sign and cosign, 
pay, insurance and release oc- 
cupied most of the day for Harper. 
An hour still remained in Ufiiver- 
sal Ore’s workday when he walked 
from the hospital, flagged down a 
’copter and gave directions to the 
Company’s complex. He arrived 
at the Metallurgy Lab with a half 
hour to spare. 

“Well, hello there, Gimpy,” said 
John Collins wiping his hands on 
a chemically stained smock. 
“They fixed you up awfully fast.” 
The two men shook hands. 

“It doesn’t take long any more,” 
agreed Harper. “Look, John, I 
need a small favor under the table. 
Can you help me out?” 

“Sure, if it’s within reason.” 

Harper withdrew the napkin and 
unfolded it on a counter top. “This 
is a sampling of something I 
found on the floor in the hospital 
and I’d like to know what it is. I 
don’t think it’s one of the medi- 
cinal type compounds. It 
luminous this morning but that 
seems to have left. It was almost 
powder before I scraped it up.” 

Collins looked at the meager 
scrapings and let out a low whistle, 
“Boy, there’s not much there, Ray- 
mond. One little wrong turn and 
I’ll blow the whole sampling. 
Maybe a spec test can get me

going down the right road — I don’t 
know — there just isn’t anything 
there to work with.” 

“It’s important to me, John, or I 
wouldn’t have asked.” 

“Sure. sure. OK, I’ll tell you 
what. Let me have a try at it and 
I’ll let you know if I come up with 
anything. Might be the challenge 
will do me some good.” The chem- 
ist folded the sampling and placed 
it in a safe and locked it. “Right 
now it’s closing time. Kid’s birth- 
day and I can’t be late.” 

The men said goodbye and 
parted. 



T TOOK Collins three days. 

The chemist videoed the line 
shack and the guard sent a runner 
down the line to fetch Harper. 
Collins was smiling broadly on 
the plate. 

“I got that analysis you were 
asking about, Raymond. Drop 
around when you can find time.” 

Harper beamed back. “Good 
work, John. I’ll be there in an 
hour.” 

John was waiting for him. 

“Right here you are,” Collins 
said and shoved a paper across the 
counter toward Harper. “I fig- 
ured you didn’t want the floor wax 
analyzed so I’ve omitted that.” 

Harper stared at the page of ele- 
ment signs, formulas and ratios 
before shaking his head. 

“John, I can’t make anything 
out of this.” 



“It’s a perfect sample,” said 
Collins, strutting just a bit as he 
walked around the table and took 
back the paper. “Here, look. We 
broke it down into two groupings. 
This column is the silicate rock 
group and this one is the iron 
group. The groups are at a four-to- 
three ratio. The rock breaks into 
percentages of magnesium and 
various silicate compounds. The 
iron group is broken down the 
same way. Here: eighty-nine per- 
cent iron, ten percent nickel and 
about one percent total of ele- 
ments like titanium, chromium, 
manganese, cobalt, copper and 
zinc. See?” 

“See what? Does any of this 
make sense?” asked Harper. 

“Sure it does. It’s a perfect sam- 
pling,” Collins repeated. 

“Ok, I give. It’s a perfect sam- 
pling of what?” 

“Matter. Just plain matter as we 
know it. Distributed in a random 
form of course.” 

Suddenly thoughts and images 
veiled behind a reluctant sub- 
conscious burst forth onto Har- 
per. He saw a dangling leg, a foot, 
bare without a boot. The circular 
indistinct print of a hoofless ani- 
mal seen in a museum. He felt the 
muscles set in his face as he heard 
again the words of choice in sanc- 
tuary. 

He .asked the last question, 
“Matter?” 

“Yeah, man, you know . Star 
Dust.” •

THE 

HELIX 

HLEXI 




The Geoffrey Effect — or 
never the trains shall meet! 

GERARD REJSKIND 



E d awoke to the warmth of Ju- 
lia’s arms. The softness of her 
hair tickled his nose. His uncon- 
scious mind had heard the soft hum 
from his alarm buzzer — it was 
rapidly growing louder. If he did 
not reach out to stop it he knew 
from long habit that its electronic 
circuitry would resort to other 
sonic tricks. It did. But Ed, the 
barely stirring Julia still in his 
arms, did not move, as the time- 
piece began to emit chirps that 
might have come from a cricket in 
one of, the few natural swamps not 
yet paved over. The chirps sharp- 
ened, turned to whistling sounds 
and became more clearly elec- 
tronic. Finally the alarm changed 
to its ultimate persuader — an ex- 



cellent imitation of the me- 
chanical bells in the old-fashioned 
clocks used in the first half of the 
century, 

Ed Fontaine shifted Julia to- 
ward his left as gently as he could 
and reached with his right hand to 
silence the ringing nuisance. Ju- 
lia moaned, yawned. 

“Not already?” 

“Time for breakfast.” 

She opened large blue eyes to 
him, closed them again, with a stab 
of annoyance. 

“Let’s sleep—” 

“Can’t. They expect me at 
work.” 

“You built the Jeffrey Helix — ” 

“Geoffroy,” he corrected her. 

“You built it,” she said, ignor- 



93 




ing his interruption. “You’re the 
only one who understands it. 
They can’t fire you.” 

It was true, he thought with a 
half-smile. He had built it — a sys- 
tem that would allow several sub- 
way trains to cross a stretch of rail 
at the same time without collid- 
ing. 

“That’s just it,” he said. “I’m re- 
sponsible for it. And I’ve got a 
visitor this morning. Someone 
who wants to know how I did it.” 
"‘Can’t he wait?” she asked 
sleepily, putting warm, arms 
about his midriff. 

“Wouldn’t look good. The man 
just might be my next employer.”' 
That was all it took to shake the 
sleep from her. This time her eyes 
opened wide and remained wide, 
like « vast expanse of sky. 

“Who? Where is he from? What 
do you mean — ” 

“IK/ro — is a Mr. Carruthers. 
Where ^ — is from the New York 
Transit Authority. And I mean 
that I just might work for him. Or 
his boss.” 

“Come on,” she said, pulling at 
his arm gently, “you wouldn’t 
leave Montreal — ” 

“Not that I want to. But the 
Geoffroy Helix has been operat- 
ing perfectly on the Montreal 
Metro for four years. I’ve become, 
at the ripe old age of twenty-nine, 
an electronic baby-sitter.” 

She still looked hurt. 
“Carruthers is coming from 
New York because they want one 
too. They’ve been talking about a 



massive expansion of their sub^ 
way system since traffic came to 
a complete standstill almost fif- 
teen years ago. But they can’t do it 
the way we’ve done it — unless they 
build a Geoffroy Helix.” 

“Why do they need you for 
that?” 

“You’re the one who just told 
me I was indispensable.” 

His logic glanced off her. “Who 
wants to live somewhere where the 
traffic doesn’t move?” 

“I,” he said, kissing her nose, 
“can change that.” 



O ^ER waffles and coffee — pre- 
pared automatically by a mi- 
crowave oven— she took up the 
subject again. “Are you taking 
me with you if you go to New 
York?” 

“I thought you didn’t want to 
go,” he said between bites of the 
slightly spongy synthetic waffle. 
Development of the soft flour by 
a large plastics firm ten years ear- 
lier had been the final death-blow 
to the rural economy of both the 
Canadian west and the Amer- 
ican midwest. Food made from 
the soft Hour was more nutritious 
than the real thing, though— like 
this waffle — it was oilten boringly 
consistent in texture. 

“New York,” she said, “is a nice 
place to visit — ” The rest was in- 
audible through the ersatz waffle. 

“But why don’t yoii want to live 
there?” he asked with a smile.

IF 




She finished the waffle, and grew 
more serious. “Perhaps I 
would — if it’s what you really 
want. I know you’re bored with the 
same old Helix every day. But I 
think you should go only for a lit* 
tie while. And then come back to 
Montreal.” 

“Sure. After aH, the New York 
Helix will some day be four years 
gld, too.” 

“It’ll take me some time to get 
used to it.” 

“Look,” said Ed, “I haven’t seen 
this fellow Carruthers yet. I’ll 
show him the Helix. We’ll see if he 
likes it — and if he thinks New 
York might want the man who 
built it.” 

She looked unconvinced. 

“Tell you what,” he said. “We’ll 
talk about it tonight, after I’ve 
seen Carruthers. I’ll take you to 
that little seafood place we like in 
Old Montreal. Come down to my 
office at six and we’ll paint the 
town.” 

“Paint it?” She looked sad. “Say 
goodbye to it you mean.” 



D on carruthers had 

been with the New York 
Transit Authority as an electronic 
engineer for longer than ten 
years. He was in his early forties 
and he did not conceal his sur* 
prise that his Montreal counter- 
part was more than a decade 
younger. 

“Inventors come young in Can- 
THE HELIX 



ada,” he said in the tone of a man 
to whom a smile comes easily. * 

“Inventor,” said Ed Fontaine, 
“is perhaps the wrong word. A 
development engineer is really 
all I am.” 

Carruthers raised a bushy eye- 
brow. “But no one else knows bow 
to build a Geoffroy Helix.” 

“No. That is, Leopold Geof- 
froy did. But as you probably 
know he died about three years 
ago. 

“Did he tell you how to build this 
one?” 

Ed explained. “In a way. I wrote 
my college thesis on the" Geoffroy 
effect. In that thesis I suggested 
that the effect could be used to let 
two or more subway trains cross 
at the same level. When I -gradu- 
ated 1 sent a copy of the thesis, with 
the application underlined in 
red, to the Montreal Transporta- 
tion Commission. They bit and 
asked me to do a technical study 
on the effect.” 

“Leopold Geoffroy himself 
helped you, I understand.” 

“Yes. The MTC brought him 
from France. And it was really he 
who worked out the mathematics 
behind the hardware I merely de- 
signed.” 

“That hardware,” said Carruth- 
ers, “is what I came to find out 
about.” 

“You’ve read technical papers, 
on the Geoffroy effect?” ask^ Ed. 

“I have. And frankly it didn’t 
make a damned bit of sense.”

44^HIS is the Geoffrey Helix/’ 

‘ -I Ed Fontaine and Don Car- 
ruthers stood before the huge con- 
trol panel. It glowed with indicator 
lamps. Carruthers looked to the 
right, at three rows of shiny blue 
equipment racks. 

“Run by a computer, I see.’’ 

“Two computers,” said Ed. 
“The Helix is pretty complicated, 
and we don’t want a circuit fail- 
ure to foul things up. The com- 
puters are paralleled through an 
AND gate. They check on each 
other.’’ 

“Nice.’’ Carruthers turned his 
attention to the imposing panel 
before him. “This, I take it,’’ he 
said, waving at the blinking 
lights, “tells you where the subway 
trains are.” 

“Only the ones in the vicinity of 
the Helix,” said Ed. “When a train 
takes a tunnel leading to the 
Helix, sensors pick up its pres- 
ence, the computers make sure the 
route is clear for it and operate 
the circuitry to take^it into the 
Helix and out the other side. Here, 
for instance — ” he pointed to a 
trio of lights on the panel — “we 
have a train approaching the 
Helix southbound on line six. 
These two trains — ” he pointed 
again — “are within the Heli>. 
They’re doing the seemingly im- 
possible. They’re crossing the 
same space without being aware 
of each other. Now iht second 
train is out of the Helix and the 
first train has entered.” 



“Impressive. But does it really 
get traffic around faster?” 

“It does. All but three of our^ 
eleven lines cross at the Helix.” Ed 
turned to a map. “The Helix is 
here. And Berri-de-Montigny sta- 
tion is here, just next to it. From' 
that station you can depart in any 
of sixteen different directions. 
You can get almost anywhere in 
town by Metro, taking no more 
than two trains.” 

Ed paused to let the signifi- 
cance sink in. “If you built an 
eight-line interchange, putting 
one line above the other, some 
passengers might have to climb up 
or down as far as twenty stories to 
change trains. It would take them 
all day.” 

“You could rig traffic lights — to 
let the trains through an ordinary 
interchange one at a time.” 

“And an Irish cop with a whis- 
tle,” suggested Ed. 

Don Carruthers laughed with 
ebullient humor. 



B y mid-afternoon the 

two men were in shirtsleeves 
and Don Carruthers was laboring 
with a branch of mathematics he 
had scarcely touched since uni- 
versity days. He was still well up 
on basic calculus, as he had to be. 
But this was calculus of a differ- 
ent order and his brain wearied ! 
rapidly before the pages of equa- 
tions. 

“Thirty-two simultaneous equa- i 



96 



IF] 




tions, all with five-fold iterated in- 
tegrals,” said Carruthers. “You 
solved these in your head, of 
course.” 

“Me and five-million other peo- 
ple,” said Ed. “We used a com- 
puter’ naturally. We went down 
to MIT and borrowed a sixth- 
generation computer they’d just 
built. First we stopped off in New 
York and got a smaller computer 
to work out the program for the 
big one.” 

“1 believe it. But equations, even 
thirty-two of them, don’t make a 
theory.” 

“They did for Leopold Geof- 
froy.” 

“And for you, by the look of it. 
You really earned your degree 
with that thesis.” 

“Oh, I didn’t solve the whole 
thing in my thesis. I extended the 
theory enough to suggest appli- 
cations. It was only when the 
MTC hired me that the real fun 
began.” 

“If I understand all this correct- 
ly,” said Carruthers at length, 
“the subway trains don’t really go 
through each other, as everyone 
thinks.” 

“Right. They go around each 
other. But they don’t do it in the 
usual way — over-and-under, say. 
They do it in another dimension.” 

“Time?” 

“I don’t know. And I don’t think 
Leopold Geoffroy knew. Geof- 
frey’s point was that we didn’t need 
to wait until we understood di- 



mension in order to deal with it 
mathematically. Mathematics 
can deal with a hundred — a thou- 
sand — dimensions all at once. 
The math just gets complicated. 
And Geoffroy theorized that if 
you can deal with a problem 
mathematically you can use that 
mathematics to give you a physi- 
cal solution. Geoffroy did the 
math. He and I together did the 
physics. Come, I’ll show you the 
first machine built to test the 
Geoffroy effect.” 



T he machine was much small- 
er than Carruthers had expect- 
ed. It occupied no more than two 
equipment racks. Its small control 
panel held only a power switch and 
two buttons, marked respectively 
operate and release. 

On the floor was a small metal 
chute with a half-inch wide groove 
down its length. The chute, on its 
way to the floor, passed through a 
black metal tunnel, connected to 
the racks by a large cable. 

“It looks like a toy I used to roll 
marbles down when 1 was a kid,” 
said Carruthers. 

“That’s what it is,” said Ed Fon- 
taine. “Watch.” 

He flipped the power switch to 
on, and a faint hum filled the room. 
He took a marble from a drawer, 
brought it to the top of the chute 
and released it. It slid down 
through the black tunnel and to 
the floor. 



THE HELIX 



97 




“How many points?” asked Car- 
ruthers. 

“The points come for the next 
trick — Geoffrey’s trick,” said Ed. 

He slid a black plate through a 
slit in the tunnel, so that it blocked 
the chute. Then once again, he re- 
leased the marble from the top of 
the chute. It rolled down and into 
the tunnel, striking the metal 
plate audibly. 

“It’s stuck,” said Carruthers. 

“Not for long.” 

Ed pressed the operate button, 
paused momentarily, and then 
pressed the release button. The 
marble continued its journey 
down the chute, as though the plate 
were not there. 

Carruthers’ jaw fell. 

Ed Fontaine could hoi repress 
his smile. He scooped up the mar- 
ble and repeated the operation. 
This time the marble did not even 
pause on its way through the tun- 
nel. 

“It went right through a metal 
plate,” said Carruthers, awed by 
the concrete demonstration of 
what had been only equations. 

“Not through. Around.” 

“In a fourth dimension — ” 

“A fourth and a fifth,” said Ed. 
“To get the Helix effect, you need 
two extra dimensions. Suppose 
a straight line represents the three 
dimensions that we know. That 
metal plate would be just a dot, 
blocking that line. What the mar- 
ble did was leave the straight line 
entirely and spiral around it.” 



“Like a helix?” 

“Its path is helix-shaped — hence 
the name. It’s a bit like modu- 
lating an AM transmitter, except 
that you’re modulating in two 
parameters at once.” 

“And,” said Carruthers, still 
awed, “you’re modulating a sol- 
id object instead of a carrier.” 

When the two men returned to 
Ed Fontaine’s office, a phone call 
was waiting for Ed. It was Julia. 

“Are you on your way to New 
York yet?” she asked, with a hint 
of moroseness. 

“I’ve just shown our guest the 
Geoffroy effect,” he told her, by 
way of an answer. 

“Keeping our date?” 

“Absolutely. Six o’clock. We’ll 
do the, sights.” Julia wanted to 
know what dress to wear. “Wear 
the long gold one I like,” he told 
her. “We might go dancing after 
dinner.” 

“Wife?” asked Carruthers, af- 
ter Ed had hung up. 

“Fiancee,” said Ed. “I’m trying 
to console her.” He hesitated. 
“She’s upset because she knows 
you’re looking at the Helix and 
she thinks you might — ah — be 
looking at me, too.” ^ 

Carruthers nodded. “No doubt 
about it. You did your thesis on 
this thing and I’m too rusty on the 
math. Besides, you’ve already 
built one. We’d want you for a 
while at least.” 

There were other details to dis- 
cuss and here Carruthers was on 



98 



IF 




his owh territory. What did build- 
ing a Helix involve from the engi- 
neering standpoint, he wanted to 
know. How big was it? What was it 
made of? Carruthers blanched 
when Ed told him how much cop- 
per was inside the Helix. 

“Do you know how much cop- 
per costs these days? Can’t we 
economize? Say, by using gold?” 

“Silver should work pretty 
well.” 

“Glad you’re being reason- 
able,” said Carruthers. “What the 
hell! The Transit Authority plans 
to blow so much on new subway 
lines that we could line the Helix 
with platinum and they wouldn’t 
notice.” 

By the time the two men put 
down their papers the summer sun 
was showing the reddishness of 
afternoon’s end. Ed Fontaine in- 
stantly thought again of Julia, 
slim and beautiful, with eyes bluer 
than the eastern sky outside his 
window. She was coming soon. 

“Tomorrow,” he said, “I’ll show 
you the Helix itself.” 

“I don’t suppose you can* walk 
into it?” asked Carruthers, his in- 
terest still alight after the long 
day. 

“No. You can just see trains go 
in and out. But that’s worth the 
fare by itself.” 

“One thing I don’t imderstand,” 
said Carruthers. “Geoffroy was 
French. Why didn’t the Paris sub- 
way system get its owa Helix?” 

“Good question. BM remember 



that Paris, unlike Montreal, al- 
ready had Metro lines just about 
everywhere. Besides, Geoffroy 
wasn’t taken seriously in his own 
country. He was a biochemist, 
not a physicist. And he had retired 
by the time he wrote his paper on 
the Geoffroy effect in nineteen- 
seventy-seven. A lot of people 
thought he was dotty.” 

“So you discovered him, really?” 
“I discovered a use for his theo- 
ry. There are probably others.” 
“There’s too damn much spe- 
cialization nowadays,” said Car- 
ruthers. “Let a man step a little 
way out of his narrow field and 
people — ” 

Bells. ... 

The clanging of emergency bells 
cut through the corridors and the 
offices like a wrecker’s hammer. 
Ed Fontaine knew that they were 
not real bells, but computers re- 
producing what they had been 
told bells should sound like. But in 
the imitation, they had made the 
bell-sound even more strident and 
shrill than the original. And these 
ersatz bells meant what bells had 
meant for centuries. 

Trouble. 

Ed leaped up and ran out of his 
office in the direction of the 
Helix, several hundred feet away. 
Don Carruthers, the bells awak- 
ening the same instinct within him, 
followed only slightly more slowly. 

T hree technicians were al- 
ready in the Helix room. The 



THE HELIX 



99 




huge red emergency light was glow- 
ing brightly. 

“We’ve lost a train,’’ said a tech- 
nician as Ed entered. “It’s in the 
Helix. And it won’t come out.” 

Ed quickly surveyed the huge 
board. The indicators indeed 
showed one train still within the 
Helix. It was southbound, he saw, 
from Henri-Bourassa, on one of 
the original lines, built just before 
Expo ’67, two decades before. At 
the entrance to the Helix, trains 
were waiting on all lines. 

“No chance of a collision?” 
asked Don Carruthers, behind 
him. 

“No. By now, the computers will 
have turned on red Tights in all tun- 
nels leading to the Helix.” 

Precious seconds ticked by. One 
technician left the glowing panel 
to step to a rack and push what 
must have been a reset button for 
the bells. The computers’ exag- 
gerated ringing stopped, though 
the emergency light continued to 
glow silently. The quiet seemed 
more awful than the clangor of the 
bells. 

Ed walked to the big panel. He 
dialed a number on a device not 
unlike the dials that had adorned 
telephones as recently as ten 
years before. He pushed a button. 

Nothing happened. 

He repeated the operation twice, 
three times. But the three indica- 
tor lights continued to show the 
train inside the Helix. Don Car- 
ruthers walked up to the panel. 



“It has never broken down in 
four years,” Ed said almost in 
audibly. 

Carruthers touched his arm. 
“Look, I don’t want to be a strang- 
er at the wrong time, I — ” 

“No, don’t go. You’re no strang- 
er to the Helix now. You might as 
well see it when it’s not working.” 

In the next few minutes Ed tried 
several tactics. He bypassed the 
Helix controls and asked the twin 
computers, with a hastily drawn- 
Mp Cobol program, to release the 
train on line two, southbound. The 
computer teleprinter typed out 
the word TILT. It had been ini- 
tially programed to write that 
word, Ed knew; when an error had 
been made in a program. He 
checked his program for a flub, 
couldn’t find one and began writ- 
ing another, calling for a differ- 
ent operations sequence. 

The switchboard operator 
came in. 

“MTC head office on the line,” 
she told Ed. “They want to know 
what we’re going to do about the 
breakdown.” 

Ed looked at his watch. Only 
twenty-two minutes had elapsed 
since the bells had sounded. It had 
seemed like three times as long. 

“Tell them,” he said, “to get 
everything with wheels out there 
on the road. There must be a half- 
million people still stranded 
downtown.” 

Ed completed his second pro- 
gram and fed it to the computers 



100 



IF 




once more. The teleprinter came 
to life in seconds. 

TILT. 

A third program, more like the 
first. 

TILT, YOU DINGALING. 

It was the phrase they had been 
told to print, to mock anyone un- 
fortunate enough to make errors 
in three successive programs. It 
had seemed funny when Ed had 
first programed them. 

“Why,” he asked through 
clenched teeth, “can’t I get it 
right?” 

“I think you are doing it right,” 
said Carruthers. “You’re just 
asking the computers to do 
something they can’t do.” 

Ed protested. “But they can do 
it. They’re in charge. They run the 
Helix.” 

“Using what they know of the 
train positions,” said Carru- 
thers. “I’ll bet you’ve programed 
them to keep two trains from col- 
liding, no matter what.” 

“Of course.” 

“That means,” said Carru- 
thers, “that the computers won’t 
take orders about when to release 
a train. In fact, they don’t even rec- 
ognize such instructions. They 
assume you made a mistake in 
the program and give you the 
thumbs-down sign.” 

T he telephone call was for Ed. 

At the other end was the chair- 
man of the MTC, red-hot, want- 
ing to know what was going on. It 



was bad enough that the entire 
Metro — save the three lines not 
using the Helix — was paralyzed. 
But the reporters were down his 
neck, wanting details on what ra- 
dio and television were already 
calling the biggest traffic tieup 
in Monteal history. Worse, one 
of the sharper newsmen had al- 
ready dug up the rumor that a 
train was missing in the Helix. 

“Get that train out!” was the or- 
der. Ed knew that the MTC chair- 
man had never been enamored of 
the Helix project. He had agreed 
to its construction only because 
the mayor had insisted. 



44T OOK,” said Carruthers, “I 
A-^know this is probably a ri- 
diculous idea. But what would 
happen if you just turned the He- 
lix off?” 

“I don’t know. We’ve never 
tried it because of the danger. It 
might work. Or it might lose us the 
train forever.” 

“You said it was a bit like mod- 
ulating an AM transmitter. If 
you shut off the signal to the trans- 
mitter the signal returns to the 
baseline. For the train that would 
mean home.” 

“True,” said Ed. “But if you 
shut the power off on the transmit- 
ter, the carrier doesn’t return to 
its starting point. It vanishes.” 

There was a brief silence before 
Carruthers said, “Why not try it 
on your model Helix?” 



THE HELIX 



101 




The two men stared at each oth- 
er. Without a word they marched 
to the room where the little Helix, 
with its marble chute, was kept. 
Ed snapped on the power switch. 
He waited for a few seconds, then 
released the marble from the top. 
He operated the two buttons in 
sequence and the marble seemed 
to roll through the steel plate to the 
floor. 

“Now — “ said Ed. He released 
the marble again, but this time 
pushed only the operate button. 
The marble rolled into the tunnel 
and vanished. Ed placed his fin- 
ger on the power switch. “Here 
goes nothing.’' He pushed tbe 
switch to off. 

Nothing happened. 

On. Off. On. Still nothing. Ed 
pushed the release button. The 
marble did not reappear. He 
pushed the operate and release 
buttons again, with no result. He 
reached for a Robertson screw- 
driver and removed the screws 
holding the cover of the black 
tunnel. He removed the cover, 
exposing the entire chute. The 
steel plate was there. 

But the marble was not. 

The two men returne'd to the 
Helix room, the telephone oper- 
ator was back on the line. 

“Some reporters to see you, 
Mr. Fontaine.” 

“Tell them to go see the brass at 
head office,” Ed told her. 

“They say they did so, sir. And 
they were told to come see you.” 



It figured. The MTC head was 
going to see him and the Helix 
project tarred and feathered. 

“I don’t want to talk to them. 
Tell them — ” He thought for a mo- 
ment. “Tell them that a break- 
down has taken place in the Helix. 
One train has been stranded but 
we hope to get it out soon.” 

“Think you can?” asked Car- 
ruthers when he had cradled the 
receiver. 

“God knows.” 

Ed felt suddenly hoAv much 
younger and less experienced he 
was than his New York visitor. 
He was used to pressure of a cer- 
tain kind — the kind generated by 
taking on a project that no one 
else believed would work. And his 
self-assurance had stood him in 
good stead, especially when he 
had talked the city of Montreal 
into letting him, a raw graduate, 
spend millions to test a wild the- 
ory. But he was not accustomed 
to the knowledge that the 
lives — or possible deaths — of 
thousands depended on him. 
Don Carruthers had faced such 
crises often during his ten years 
with the NYCTA. Ed himself 
might have gained such exper- 
ience, had he not been in charge of 
a project which had worked with 
eerie perfection. Until today. 

He looked at his watch. Five 
minutes to seven. Almost an 
hour and a quarter had elapsed 
since the train had vanished into 
the Helix. And he stood no closer 



102 



IF 




to a solution than he had before 
the bells had begun to ring. 

Five to seven, 

Julia had been due at his office 
at six. 

He walked to the switchboard 
operator’s desk. ‘‘Has my fi- 
ancee been here asking for me?” 

‘‘No, Mr. Fontaine.” 

‘‘I was expecting her at six.” 

“She probably couldn’t get 
through,” she said, “The Metro’s 
not working and you can’t get a 
cab for love or money tonight.” 

It was true, Ed knew. He stepped 
to a telephone and punched out 
Julia’s familiar number. He let 
the soft electronic whirr sound 
ten times before he replaced the 
receiver. She probably couldn’t 
get through the traffic, he re- 
peated to himself. 

Yet,,, 

Yet she hadn’t called to let him 
know. The omission was unchar- 
acteristic of exact, punctual 
Julia. A chill caught his heart. He 
turned again to the switchboard 
operator. 

“What was the exact time of the 
accident?” 

“Five-thirty-nine in the after- 
noon, according to the opera- 
tions center. Train seven-three had 
just picked up passengers at Sher- 
brooke station before entering 
the Helix.” 

And before that, Ed thought, it 
had stopped at Mont-Royal sta- 
tion. Among the passengers 
boarding might have been Julia, 



Julia, bound for downtown to 
meet him. To paint the town. 

S OMEONE had sent for pizza 
and someone else had dragged 
a microwave coffeepot from a 
drawer. The device was not large, 
but it could brew coffee six times 
faster than the old heating-ele- 
ment coffee-makers. The coffee 
less than great, thought Ed, but it 
was what he needed. He turned 
down the pizza. 

Twelve hours had passed — no 
more than twelve hours, since he 
had awakened with Julia’s soft 
hair in his eyes. He remembered 
how upset she had been at the 
thought of leaving Montreal. 
New York had seemed far away to 
her. But how much farther away 
was she tonight? Where were 
Leopold Geoffory’s extra two di- 
mensions? Geoffroy himself 
hadn’t cared. It had been enough 
for him that the dimensions ex- 
isted in the world of mathemat- 
ics — and that the mathematics 
corresponded to some sort of 
physical reality. And he, Ed 
Fontaine, had agreed with Geof- 
froy that it was unnecessary to 
have a subjective notion of just 
what the physical reality was. 

. But now things had gone wrong. 
And suddenly it was vitally im- 
portant to know where the Geof- 
froy dimensions lay. 

Ed walked, slowly, back into 
the Helix room. The emergency 
lights and the lights indicating 



THE HELIX 



103 




the train in the Helix still glowed. 
He fingered the controls again, 
ordering the Helix to disgorge 
its prey — with the same results as 
before. It was then that Ed no- 
ticed Don Carruthers, his tie loos- 
ened and his jacket off, working 
at a table in a corner. Ed could see 
that Carruthers had before him a 
sheaf of equations for the Geof- 
froy effect. And he had made 
copious notations on some sheets 
of paper. 

“Ideas?” Ed asked. 

“Yes.” 

“Don’t keep them to yourself.” 
“I’ve come to an inescapable 
conclusion,” said Carruthers, 
He paused dramatically. 

“Leopold Geoffroy should have 
stuck to his biochemistry .’^’ 

“What do you mean?” 

“Simply that the Geoffroy ef- 
fect is a lot of hooey.” 

“But it works,” protested Ed. 
“Yeah? Make it work now.” 

Ed remembered his mathemat- 
ical superiority over the older 
man and -he felt a twinge of resent- 
ment. 

“I’ve gone over the theory 
again,” continued Carruthers, 
indicating the papers. “What 
Geoffroy describes mathemati- 
cally is a five-dimensional He- 
lix, established and maintained 
by a giant electrical field.” 

“Yes— so?” 

“So, when you cut the power to 
an electrical field, it collapses. 
That means the marble should 



have reappeared in your baby He- 
lix when you cut the power.” 

“But it didn’t.” 

“It didn’t,” said Carruthers, 
“because Geoffroy was wrong. 
When was the last time you played 
with an ordinary oscilloscope?” 
“Back in my undergrad days, I 
suppose,” replied Ed. 

“You should do it more often. 
You’ll learn things. Now if you use 
the ’scope in the ordinary way, 
you insert a signal into the x ax- 
is to get vertical deflection and 
the y axis to get horizontal de- 
flection of the dot on the screen. 
Now many ’scopes, in the back, 
have a third input, correspond- 
ing to a z axis.” 

“To deflect the electron beam 
in a third direction,” said Ed, “in 
and out of the screen.” 

“The hell!” shouted Carruth- 
ers. “Sure you treat that beam 
mathematically as though it 
moved in a third dimension. But 
what does it really do?” 

“It— it cuts off.” 

“Damn right. It doesn’t go into 
the surface of the oscilloscope 
screen. It just goes away.” 

“But it comes back.” 
Carruthers shook his head. 
“No it doesn’t. That’s another 
electron beam, a different 
stream of electrons. You call it the 
same beam because it appears 
where you’d expect the vanished 
beam to reappear. That’s what’s 
wrong with confusing mathe- 
matics and physics. Just because

IF 




there appears to be a correspond- 
ence between your equations and 
reality, you assume that the cor- 
respondence is perfect.” 

“If I understand,” said Ed, 
“you don’t believe the Geoffroy 
Helix really exists.” 

“And it doesn’t. Your baby He- 
lix,” said Carruthers, “didn’t 
swing the marble around in some 
unknown dimensions to ‘get it 
around that steel plate. It de- 
stroyed that marble] And it built a 
copy of it on the other side.” 
“That’s ridiculous.” 

“That’s why the marble van- 
ished when you turned off the pow- 
er. The circuit forgot how to dup- 
licate the lost marble.” 

The silence was long before Ed 
spoke. “If you’re right — people 
taking a train through the Helix 
never really come back. What 
comes back is a clever electronic 



imitation, with a copy of their 
features a copy of their newspa- 
per — 

“And counterfeit money in their 
pockets,” added Carruthers. 

“Then how do we get the Helix 
to build us a new train just like the 
old one?” 

“Repair the fault in the Helix 
circuitry.” 

“But we can’t do that without 
shutting it down. And if we do — ” 

Carruthers nodded grimly. 
Ed thought again of Julia, a non- 
existent Julia — vaporized ear- 
lier in the evening — of whom only 
his own electronic creation held 
the blueprint. The thought re- 
mained in his mind as he gazed at 
the Helix panel. And so it hap- 
pened that he was watching at the 
precise moment that three lights 
blinked on, indicating that a 
train had left the Helix and' was

pulling into Berri-de-Montigny 
station — three hours late. 



N O DESCRIPTION can do jus- 
tice to the moments of jubi- 
lation that followed, as news of 
the train’s return spread through 
the building. Ed himself felt a re- 
lief that all but brought tears to his 
eyes. He felt too jubilant to take 
seriously what happened next. 

The switchboard operator, 
working well beyond her normal 
quitting time, phoned him. 

“There’s a man at my desk,” she 
announced. “He says the Mar- 
tians have landed!” 

Ed might have responded to 
such an announcement with 
laughter at the best of times. But 
now, following the tension of the 
evening and the sudden relief, he 
roared. The laughter bubbled out 
of him, filling the Helix ropm 
with peals of loud and merry 
sound. Martians? They were all he 
needed to end the day right. He 
was still laughing when a techni- 
cian rushed in. 

“It’s true!” the technician 
cried. “I saw one outside — ” 

Ed’s laughter died. Something 
in his mind clicked and instantly 
he knew there would indeed be 
strange beings outside. There 
were no more surprises in the 
words he heard swirling about 
him. 

“Somebody said they came out 
of the Berri Metro ...” 



“They’re almost like people but 
purplish and wrinkled, like ant- 
eaters ...” 

“There are hundreds ...” 

Ed brushed past the others to- 
ward the front door. A cold terror 
crept up from the base of his spine. 
And over the terror were the 
thoughts of his cool, scientific 
mind. He did not scream as he saw 
the anteater-like beings. He 
knew. Carruthers had been right. 
The Helix was no helix at all. It 
destroyed and reconstituted 
them from memory. But its mem- 
ory was limited. It remembered 
by repeating the message, over 
and over, to itsdf . 

How many times had it re- 
peated the blueprint of the miss- 
ing train in three hours? And how 
accurately? 

Not Martians! Commu- 
ters — as remembered in a story 
that has been repeated again and 
again and again . Human be- 
ings remembered by an inhu- 
man machine that had been forced 
to remember too long. 

And Ed’s horrified brain knew 
what he was seeing. One of the pa- 
thetic, shuffling creatures — its 
snout dripping with a nameless 
fluid, its purplish, wrinkled head 
covered in long matted hair — had 
blue eyes. It wore a gold-colored 
robe. 

Ed Fontaine sank to his knees, 
mouthing the word that was to be- 
come an unending scream. 

“Julia ...” •

SLIGHT 

DETOUR 




Earth was out of boundsr 
but Radnor from the stars 
had a job to do! 

RICHARD E. PECK 



R adnor fell a powerful urge 
to sleep. No reason not to. 
The prisoner was securely bound. 
Sleep for a few moments. What 
would it matter? Sleep, and dream 
of homecoming. He had earned it. 
A short nap. Lovely sleep. Quiet 
and peaceful. Quiet and sleepy. 
Quiet . 

No! He bolted erect and 
scrubbed the back of his hand 
across sagging eyelids, trying to 
fight the languor that melted his in- 
sides. He stumbled and grabbed the 
command cot stanchions to steady 
himself. His blurry vision cleared 
as he shook off his torpor and 
scanned the cramped cabin — and 
understood. Sitting behind the 
plastocene psi-shield, his prisoner. 



107 



Kern, smiled sardonically and 
raised his eyebrows. 

“Nice try,” Radnor said. “But 
not this time.” 

He shivered inwardly and felt 
much less confident than he tried 
to appear. What power Kern must 
possess! He had entered Radnor’s 
mind, nearly hypnotizing him 
without even gaining his conscious 
attention — and through a psi-shield 
at that. But Radnor hadn’t made 
First Bailiff by being careless, or 
weak, or easily deceived. Complete 
this assignment successfully and he 
would get his final promotion to 
Division Chief. No more lonely 
transport trips from Melan’s cor- 
rection block to the psi-test as- 
teroid in its isolated corner of the 
galaxy. 

Be cautious, he told himself. 
Kern is special.,. 

But then, so was Radnor. No 
one in the Bailiff Corps tested so 
high in survival potential; few had 
the danger instinct he possessed, a 
touch of undefined psi that had 
made him the logical choice as 
Kern’s transport guard. If anyone 
was a logical choice. 

Even the medicos on Melan were 
unable to define the extent of 
Kern’s abilities. He was unusual 
— that much they knew — perhaps 
even unique. More precise defini- 
tion could wait until the special- 
ists took over when Radnor 
dropped him at the psi-test center 
(when — he refused to think if). 

He had studied Kern’s scanty 



dossier carefully before accepting 
the assignment. He knew Kern as 
well as anyone could, but that 
knowledge did not include under- 
standing. How a man could 
delight in violence and motiveless 
treachery was beyond understand- 
ing. Yet Kern did. Irrefutable 
evidence lay recorded in his 
dossier; interference with public 
communication networks, for no 
reason; several murders, all unex- 
plainable in rational terms; fan- 
tastic public escapades, such as his 
somehow forcing the Melanian 
governor’s wife to disrobe at the 
height of the Spring Renewal 
Rites, just as the priests had begun 
the most solemn of absolutions. 
Though Kern’s powers were as yet 
undefined, his insanity was clear. 

For reasons the medicos were 
still trying to explain, instability 
and abnormal psi-powers always 
seemed mental partners. Para- 
noids are often merely perceptives 
in a limited way, gleaning from 
the thoughts of those around them 
only the violence and hatred that 
remain subliminal in healthy 
minds. The poltergeist phenome- 
non occurs only in the presence of 
the psi-gifted and aberrant who 
recognize neither of those traits in 
themselves. But the proportions of 
psi-power and instability vary with 
the individual. Most of the pre- 
cogs or telepaths on Melari — a 
minute proportion of the popu- 
lace — were merely eccentric. Be- 
cause they devoted their skills to 



108 



IF 




socially beneficial ends, people ig- 
nored tljeir eccentricities. And 
when extreme psi-gifts combined 
with the self-awareness of social 
deviation, the most fully gifted 
usually drove themselves into a 
kind of self-induced catatonia; they 
were thus no problem. 

Y et there was Kern. Undoubt- 
edly the strongest gift ever re- 
corded in Melanian medical 
history, his powers had led to in- 
sanity but not to self-censure. If 
the word “anti-social” had any 
absolute meaning, it meant 
“Kern.” Radnor had formulated a 
theory about it after reading the 
dossier, but the medicos had 
refused to listen. Kern was still a 
child, no matter his physiological 
age. That had to be it. In some 
corner of the quagmire that might 
be called Kern’s mind lurked a 
malevolent child, a demonic imp 
who delighted in grotesque pranks 
and lacked any touch of the most 
rudimentary conscience. 

But Radnor’s theory had not 
prepared him for meeting his 
prisoner. He had found Kern 
cradled in a body-rack behind the 
silver-wired grid of a psi-shield, 
where the medicos had strapped 
him after capturing him in his 
sleep. Radnor’s gorge rose at the 
memory: a huge lizard exuding its 
fetid saurian stench, its abdomen 
ripped open to display the swarm- 
ing, bloody * mass of twisted 
intestines, had greeted him with a 



wordless, keening cry. For a 
moment. Then the raucous laugh 
that was really Kern had echoed 
through the ship and the lizard had 
faded from sight to reveal Kern 
sitting there behind his pleased 
smirk. Just as he sat now. 

He was handsome, Radnor ad- 
mitted, though he disliked finding 
anything about the prisoner he 
could admire — close-cropped 

blond curls, brilliant, almost 
electric, blue eyes; Kern looked like 
a tri-di of the All-Man, which 
Radnor had seen so many times 
floating above the altar in every 
Melanian temple. 

Handsome was not an adequate 
word. Commanding, charismatic, 
dynamic — all of these came nearer 
the mood Radnor felt laving over 
his thoughts as he stared at the 
prisoner. 

But even as he stared, he knew 
that Kern might look nothing at 
all as he now appeared, for that 
was the distinctive mark of the 
man’s powers: as far as the 
medicos had been able to establish, 
Kern wasn’t precog, showed no 
evidence of telepathic or telekine- 
tic powers, lacked most of the us- 
ual abilities one expected to find. 
He was instead a chameleon, able 
to change appearance at will. No 
one knew whether he literally 
changed form or only seemed to. 
Even in sleep his features shifted 
slightly. What inconclusive physio- 
logical examinations the medicos 
had been able to perform proved 



A SLIGHT DETOUR 



109 




nothing. If anyone touched him he 
shimmered through a whole range 
of shapes, occasionally human, 
more often animal. A psi*shield 
damped that ability but could not 
cancel it out, proof in itself of the 
man’s powers. 

Radnor was not even certain of 
Kern’s sex; he had seen him once as 
a provocative nude girl, motion- 
ing toward him and pleading with 
wordless sounds. But that had 
been moments after takeoff. Then 
Radnor had been fresh, wary, not 
as strangely tired as he now felt. 
The deceit had failed — intellect 
overcoming what his glands had 
urged — and had even served as a 
memorable warning. With the 
long journey from Melan to the 
psi-test center still ahead, he had 
tried to avoid looking at Kern, 
except when feeding him. They 
had a month together in the tiny 
ship and Radnor was determined 
to see his cargo safely in the hands 
of the psi-specialists. Let them fig- 
ure Kern out. 

Still, this current Resemblance 
between Kern and the All-Man 
was uncanny, even if it were mere- 
ly a momentary shape Kern had 
assumed. The f^act that the like- 
ness was so striking argued a 
logical mind underlying the 
transfomation. The dossier spoke 
of Kern’s totally random be- 
havior. Radnor no longer accepted 
that evaluation; Kern obviously 
chose his disguises carefully, 
could calculate intended effect and 



was therefore even more danger- 
ous than the medicos kijew. Rad- 
nor stared at the bronzed, muscu- 
lar form straining at the bonds be- 
hind the shield. How could such 
foulness appear so outwardly be- 
nign? 

He snorted at his own maudlin 
feelings and recognized unbidden 
sympathy coursing through him. 
He knew better than to become 
involved with a prisoner; all 
bailiffs knew better. His job was 
merely to capture if necessary, to 
transport, but not to judge. Let the 
medicos examine and cure Kern. It 
was none of his business, no matter 
how curious he might be. But how, 
for example, could Kern sit 
immobile for hours at a time? 

Radnor stared. A slight haze 
swept over Kern’s features, de- 
focusing him momentarily. Could 
he be in the act of shifting to some 
new form? Radnor peered more 
closely, unable to look away, fas- 
cinated by what the next few 
moments might show him. A faint 
noise at his back irritated him; 
something was interfering with 
his concentration. He swept an 
angry hand over his face and drew 
it away in shock. He was 
drenched — perspiration was pour- 
ing down his forehead. 

He glanced away from Kern to 
the soaked palm or his own hand 
and as he did he saw — out of the 
corner of his now distracted 
eye — that the prisoner’s body rack 
was empty! He quickly looked 



110 



IF 




back to see Kern in place, still 
immobile, but shimmering and 
insubstantial. A trick.,, the 
thought hit him. 

A faint shadow waving. A sound 
behind him. Then Kern struck. 

Radnor fell heavily to the deck 
at the explosion inside his skull. 
Calling on every scintilla of con- 
centration, he hung grimly onto 
consciousness and lurched up- 
right to one knee. He turned to- 
ward the pain in time to glimpse a 
huddled figure hurling itself into 
the escape capsule. Then the air- 
lock iris cycled and Kern was gone. 
Radnor gave in to unconscious- 
ness. 

H e found himself kneeling 
beside the control console, 
one hand already on the scanner 
switch. Trying to ignore the 
pounding inside his head, he 
crawled onto the command cot 
and simultaneously activated the 
scanners. Through luck — or some 
instinct Radnor couldn’t name — 
Kern had chosen the right instant 
to effect his escape. The capsule 
plummeted toward Sol Three, the 
only habitable planet in that sys- 
tem and the nearest possible hiding 
place. So. the man did have a touch 
of the telepath in him, after all; he 
was clearly acting on Radnor’s 
knowledge. 

Radnor thought of his Division 
Chiefs reaction. There went the 
Bailiff Corps’ proud reputation, 
flitting away because of his in- 



attention — no escapes in over two 
centuries — and now this. Worse, 
Kern was making straight for an 
interdicted system and its primi- 
tive world. There was no telling 
what a disruptive force he might 
prove. And to demonstrate space 
flight to primitives! The potential 
culture shock was inconceivable. 
All societies lacking atomic pow- 
er — Sol Three among them — were 
under automatic interdiction. 

Radnor hesitated only a 
moment. For atmosphere entry 
alone, he might well be busted from 
the Corps, his career as Bailiff 
ruined. But if Kern escaped! 

He refused to consider it. He 
locked his tracer beam on the cap- 
sule growing smaller every second 
in the ship’s scanners, and offered 
up a small prayer of apology as his 
ship dove lower, dragging down 
Radnor’s future with it. 

Kern headed for the nightside, 
arching toward the northern 
atmosphere. Radnor closed the 
gap. The escape capsule lacked the 
speed to lose its pursuer, but its 
lead now looked insurmountable. 
Radnor pushed his ship to the 
limits of safe entry velocity — not 
enough. He switched from pray- 
ing to cursing — perhaps less 
effective but certainly more sat- 
isfying — and reached beneath the 
command cot for his huntpack, 
which he checked quickly as the 
ship blazed its way into the heavy 
atmosphere. Tranquilizer darts; 
stunner, fully charged; shiplink

beacon; pitons and elastisteei line; 
the pouch of diamonds, accept- 
able exchange anywhere in the 
known universe, though Radnor 
planned never to be in the position 
of having to contact a native for 
anything so risky as face-to-face 
trading; infrared beam and 
goggles; concentrated food for 
several days; psi-detector; and the 
force-field of the pack casing it- 
self — everything in place and 
operational. 

He flipped the bow scanner to 
full magnification and watched 
the capsule heading for the lower 
tip of a huge lake which glimmered 
flat in the light of Sol Three’s 
single moon. Then he saw the 
rockets flare as the capsule blasted 
against gravity’s pull and settled to 
a thundering crash near the lake. 
'The capsule, unlike Radnor’s ship, 
lacked anti-grav and depended for 
landing upon simple thrust engines, 
a fact that now gave Radnor a tar- 
get, a spot glowing orange-blue 
in the night. He slowed to land 
near the flames licking around the 
capsule’s touchdown point, only to 
freeze in momentary horror. A 
scant five thousand meters above 
the surface, he saw below him row 
upon row of faint lights winking in 
the darkness. Kern had landed in 
the midst of a settlement. 

Radnor reacted quickly, allow- 
ing the automatics to seek out a 
clear area and waft his ship gently 
to the surface. Full refrigeration 
cooled the ship’s hull as it descend- 



ed and Radnor waited for anchored 
stability before cycling the exterior 
hatch. 

He peered cautiously at his sur- 
roundings. Through the goggles 
now fitted close over his eyes he 
watched the pool of infrared from 
his helmet beam illuminate the 
ground around him. His ship sat 
beside a squat building some 
eight meters high, only slightly 
shorter than the ship itself. On all 
sides similar buildings reared their 
crude shapes in the darkness, all 
apparently of unpainted, wooden 
construction, all approximately 
square. They presented a little 
problem. He spun the rheostat 
which controlled the ship’s sur- 
face spectrum until a shrill whine 
sounded in his ears. He locked the 
rheostat. His ship now matched the 
surrounding buildings in color 
and apparent texture. In the 
dark — he fervently hoped — no one 
would notice. And he would be 
gone by morning. 

He gritted his teeth. He would be 
gone by morning! 

His last airborne glimpse of the 
capsule’s impact area had told 
him that less than a kilometer 
separated him from his quarry. He 
moved in that direction, huddling 
close to the wooden buildings as 
he did. A brief check of his ship- 
link beacon reassured him. It 
homed on the disguised ship and 
would serve to lead him back, 
should he become disoriented in 
these unfamiliar surroundings. 



112 



IF 




He located a street which led to- 
ward the flames now lighting the 
night sky, the point of Kern’s 
touchdown. He stepped tentatively 
forward, then ducked back as two 
men passed in animated conversa- 
tion. He understood nothing of 
what they said — nor did he plan to 
spend the hours necessary to learn 
their language through the ship’s 
translator banks— but their agita- 
tion was clear. They pointed to- 
ward the fire and broke into a 
quick trot. 

Others joined them, boiling out 
of the small buildings which lined 
the dirt street buildings all square, 
all squat, all nondescript. At least 
one problem had solved itself: the 
people’s garments were not parti- 
cularly unusual, most of them two- 
piece arrangements of shirt and 
trousers. The women wore long 
skirts which swept the dusty board 
sidewalks. Radnor decided his 
neutral gray coverall would pass, 
at least in the dark. And happily 
not all the men he saw were 
bearded. 

He stowed the goggles and 
infrared beam back in his pack; gas 
lanterns spotted at intervals along 
the winding street provided suffi- 
cient light. 

Keeping apart from the crowd ' 
which milled down the length of the 
street, he followed quickly. Then a 
strange clamor drove him into a 
doorway where he waited tense. A 
steaming boiler drawn by four 
large quadrupeds rattled past. The 



clanging noise sounded from a 
large bell mounted atop the boiler, 
shaken by one of the men who 
clung recklessly to the side of the 
careening cart. It looked to be 
some sort of steam pump^ though 
Radnor wasn’t certain. But now 
he knevy why this world was laid 
under interdict. Apparently it 
lacked even internal combustion 
engines, let alone atomic power. 
He thought once more of his pend- 
ing promotion and sighed. If he 
got out of this mess without being 
discovered... 

He covered nearly a kilometer 
before reaching the fire. It had 
already spread to several buildings 
along the riverfront but seemed to 
be under control. Fire fighters 
concentrated on containing the 
flames, spraying water on the 
surrounding buildings. 

He couldn’t approach the center 
of the blaze, not with the crowd 
gathered between him and the 
light, so he contented himself 
with trying to understand the 
crowd’s behavior. Every few 
moments a man or boy would burst 
through the wall of people stand- 
ing before him and dash past, 
carrying bulky fabric sacks looted 
from the fire area. When one of the 
sacks split and spilled on the street, 
Radpor snatched up a piece of its 
contents: compressed carbon, a 
primitive fuel. And that accounted 
for the head of the blaze now 
illuminating the sky overhead. 
Kern had landed in or near a fuel 



A SLIGHT DETOUR 



113 




storage area. Huge piles of the 
carbon burned with great in- 
tensity, sending up acrid fumes 
and flickering blue lights. With 
any luck the capsule might already 
be consumed in the blaze. And 
that would solve another problem. 

For an instant Radnor almost 
gave in to the wild hope that Kern, 
too, might have been trapped in the 
pyre, but he could not bring him- 
self to wish the extinction of any 
sentient creature, even one so 
patently mad as Kern. 

He drew the psi-detector from 
his pack and stared at the 
directional indicator. Nothing. If 
Kern lived, he was out of range. 
Luckily no one else in the crowd 
registered the slightest quiver on 
the detector’s gauge. That would 
have been the -end of his hunt, 
Radnor knew, to discover that 
these primitives possessed measur- 
able psi-powers. He almost 
smiled; things were looking up. 

He began the hunt. 

K eeping as near the blaze as 
caution would allow, he circled 
to the north, to his left. The fire 
had been contained, confined to 
four blocks of fuel depot and 
warves. The river to the e^st had 
saved the fire fighters a good share 
of their work; it also cut the arc of 
Radnor’s search to a mere hun- 
dred and eighty degrees. 

He circled left to the water’s 
edge, then doubled back to retrace 
his steps and scout the south half of 



the semicircle mapped out in his 
mind. The streets here were cobble- 
stoned, the buildings larger but 
still of wooden construction. 
Passersby ignored him, more 
involved in shouting greetings to 
one another and waving bottles— 
apparently some intoxicant. He 
sensed festival in the crowd’s 
mood. 

The southern arc of his search 
failed to draw any indication on 
the psi-detector. Several times he 
stepped into doorways to avoid 
knots of men who roamed the 
streets, singing and shouting. And 
then he saw a flicker on his gauge; 
it pointed back the way he had 
come, back toward the ship. As he 
turned to move in that direction a 
trio of men accosted him boister- 
ously, but he avoided their grasp 
and ducked around a corner — and 
into the arms of a fleshy, flaccid 
woman with straw-colored hair 
and red dye smeared across her 
mouth. He recoiled from her touch 
before recognizing her for what 
she was. The night women on 
Melan shaved their heads — he tried 
not to judge; cultures differ. He 
pushed past her just as she changed 
appearance before his eyes, the 
straw-colored hair giving way to a 
shaven, gilded skull. 

He snatched out the stunner, but 
Kern was gone into the darkness. 
Radnor cursed again and followed. 

It*s a game to him. He is playing 
tag with me,., 

Radnor swung into an easy lope. 



114 



IF 




glancing at the psi-detector’s 
wobbling needle every few yards. 
Once he stumbled over a loose 
board in the sidewalk and heard 
Kern’s raucous laughter from the 
darkness ahead. Kern was leading 
him back toward his own ship. 

It was hard to tell who dictated 
the game, he or Kern. And it was 
becoming obvious he was in real 
trouble — how would he recapture 
someone he couldn’t 'even 
recognize? Behind him pale light 
streaked the horizon above the 
ramshackle shanties. Morning 
soon. And what then? He mentally 
tested a few feeble excuses, trying 
to invent one his Division Chief 
might accept. None existed. It was 
find Kern, or else. 

He recognized buildings as he 
ran; he had come this way toward 
the Fire. But how could Kern know 
where the ship lay hidden? He 
couldn’t see through the camou- 
flage. Perhaps his powers included 
area-sens^ing. He had been aboard 
the ship long enough to familiarize 
himself with the aura of its 
electronic equipment, even though 
the dossier hadn’t so much as hint- 
ed at such possible talents. 

Nova the dossier! And nova the 
medicos.,. 

No one but Radnor knew a thing 
about Kern. And Radnor knew 
nothing certain any longer — noth- 
ing more than Kern’s teasing him, 
a spoiled child playing a game. 

He sprinted along the dimly 
lighted street, scrambling awk- 



wardly through a pile of discarded 
bottles and trash which lay in his 
path as he cut across an empty lot 
toward the ship. No one was there 
ahead of him. 

He paused to check the detector 
again. Motionless. But how? He 
knew Kern was nearby, sensed it. 
Stop, he told himself. Think it out. 
Why did,,. 

A door burst open to his left and 
sent him diving to the ground, 
stunner in his hand. A quarrel 
poured through the open door and 
followed a heavy-set woman into 
the predawn paleness. She carried 
a metal container and shouted 
something over her shoulder as 
she walked toward the squat build- 
ing beside which Ra^dnor’s ship 
stood. He waited quietly when she 
paused to glance at his disguised 
ship in bewilderment, then turned 
to shake her fist at the deep voice 
which pursued her from the house. 

She walked on and Radnor 
relaxed. He watched her enter the 
shabby structure and lay thinking. 

/ know Kerns not dead. Can he 
be asleep? 

Radnor glared at the sunlight 
slowly spreading its way up the 
side of his ship, then shook his head 
in resignation. He did not dare a 
liftoff in full daylight; someone 
would certainly see. And that 
meant he would have to wait till 
dark, either that or destroy the ship 
and sentence himself to live out his 
life in this barbaric settlement. 
Worse, such an action would

consign Kern to their midst as well. 

When matters reached the stage 
of full dilemma, Radnor knew 
what to do. Nothing. He stopped 
planning. 

Let things happen, then react... ^ 
The deep voice roared through 
the lighted doorway once more, 
and Radnor treated himself to the 
luxury of shouting a tired curse in 
answer before entering his ship. 

D arkness settled. Radnor 
had spent the day in edgy rest, 
waiting for Kern’s next move. All 
alarm systems were rigged but no 
one had approached the ship 
closer than a few meters. Radnor 
had not wasted his irritating 
leisure. Turning the ship.’s audible 
receivers to full power, he had lain 
in half-sleep while the ship’s trans- 
lator banks accumulated, parsed, 
analyzed and taught him the 
language. “English,” the primitives 
called it, a complex system but 
not impossible to grasp. Radnor 
grinned wryly; he could return to 
Melan, the Bailiff Corps’ only 
expert in this “English,” a skill cal- 
culated to get him sacked rather 
than admired. 

Overheard conversations had 
provided him with interesting 
food for speculation. The. night 
before had indeed been a sort of 
festival which recurred each 
seventh day. Called “Satyr-day” in 
English, it signaled free rein to 
licentiousness for a brief time, 
followed in turn by “Sun-day,” 



the day of recovery from Satyr- 
day’s excesses. People whose voices 
came through the ship’s receivers 
boasted of clan warfare between 
locals and members of some civic 
subdivisions called “Conley’s 
Patch” (named apparently for a 
resident) and “Kilgubbin” (un- 
translatable) to the northeast. 

But none of that information 
helped Radnor locate Kern, who 
remained hidden somewhere near- 
by. At dusk the buxom woman of 
the early morning had once more 
briefly interrupted her continuing 
quarrel with her mate to visit their 
“barn” (a building for storing 
grain and foodstuffs, housing live- 
stock). Other than that, the day 
had passed quietly. No one took 
special notice of his ship, a fact 
that he laid to the primitives’ state 
of misery hanging on from the 
revels of Satyr-day. 

.When darkness completed it- 
self, Radnor finished his pre- 
parations and Jeft the ship, leaving 
behind his huntpack. Even its 
forcefield was unnecessary; Kern 
had no physical weapons, no 
weapons at all, in fact except him- 
self. And Radnor now knew more 
about that “self’; it was the very 
weapon he would use against Kern. 

Having watched people enter 
and leave several of the shanties in 
the neighborhood, he was certain 
that Kern hid in the “barn.” It had 
remained deserted all day, except 
for the owner’s brief visit, and Kern 
would certainly have chosen the 



116 



IF 




best possible hiding place for the 
game he now^played. He was wait- 
ing to oust Radnor from the ship 
and take command himself— 
“Hill Governor,” they had called 
the game irr Radnor’s youth. 

He stalked Kern slowly, trust- 
ing now to the indefinable tingle 
he had come to associate with 
Kern’s presence aboard the ship. 
He moved toward the barn in a 
slow, arcing path, keeping 
between the barn exit and the ship. 

Must keep Kern from the ship. 
Supress all other thoughts. Keep 
Kern from the ship or hell 
escape... 

The barn door slid open easily at 
his touch and ‘he peered into the 
musky darkness. The feeling was 
stronger. Kern was... 

Keep Kern from the ship or hell 
take off without me. It's easy to 
fly it. Anyone could fly it. Keep 
Kern from the ship... 

He stepped inside. Shadows 
flickered along the far wall, cast in 
the light of a petroleum lantern 
left hanging on a hook inside the 
door. Kern was nowhere in sight. 
Several feathered bipeds {""chick- 
ens"') clucked and scratched at the 
dusty floor. 

Don't let Kern get to the ship. 
The red switch activates anti-grav. 
If . Kern lies on the command cot 
and hits that switch. ..Keep Kern 
from the ship... 

Two cows (mature female bo- 
vine, genus Bos) swung their sad 
eyes toward him and lowed quiet- 



ly. Radnor moved toward the far 
end of the barn, peering carefully 
into the dark corners. 

Where would he hide? What 
form has he — DON'T! Don't sus- 
pect. Keep Kern from the ship. 
Easy to fly. Freedom that way. 
Win the game. Finders keepers... 

He inched slowly through the 
swirling dust, carefully turning 
his back to the door and forcing 
himself not to think. To think, to 
think, to think... 

It happened. Kern’s wild laugh 
echoed behind him but Radnor 
willed himself still, not moving, 
giving Kern the chance to run. He 
turned then and saw one of the 
cows rise up on her/its/his hind 
legs and shift form, now Kern, now 
not-Kern. And Kern made his 
break. Radnor walked slowly to- 
ward her/it/him, thinking. Safe if 
he gets to the ship. Nothing to 
stop him. The ship and escape... 

But he had misjudged his quar- 
ry. Not content merely to flee 
Kern snatched the lantern from its 
hook with one hand/hoof — and 
hurled it. Radnor ducked as the 
petroleum spewed across the 
wooden floor and scattered a Car- 
pet of golden flames washing 
through the tinder-dry refuse to- 
ward him. A curtain of fire rose 
instantly to the rafters and cut off 
Radnor’s escape. But he whirled 
and kicked out a wooden shutter, 
then dove through the opening as 
Kern rounded the corner of the 
barn, sprinting now on two legs.

shifting appearance in the ghostly 
light that flickered through 
cracks in the barn wall. 

Radnor heard, I win! echo in his 
mind’s ear. He hit the hatch open- 
ing an instant before it cycled shut. 
He was inside, thinking, Kerns 
free. Hell escape. The red switch. 
Lie on the cot and hit the red 
switch,,. 

He flinched in the deluge of 
laughter pouring over him and 
watched Kern, now the bronzed 
All-Man again, dive to the couch 
and slam a palm against the anti- 
grav activator. And against the 
tranquilizer dart imbedded there, 
point up. Kern lunged back in 
anger, but too late. Elastisteel 
webbing fell from overhead and 
pinioned him to the command cot, 
where he struggled violently as the 
ship lifted. Then his struggles grew 
weaker as his body betrayed him. 
Only his mind reached out to 
Radnor, crying. Cheating! 
Cheating! / won! 

Radnor ducked behind the psi- 
shield and protected himself with 
mentally recited paradigms: I am, 
you are, he is, we are, you are, 
they are , , , 

When Kern’s thrashing subsided 
Radnor inched cautiously out 
from behind the psi-shield and 
finished binding his prisoner, 
this time in coil after coil of 
elastisteel line. He propped and 
strapped Kern once more in the 
body rack and vowed not to ex- 
change so much as a glance with 



him until touchdown at the psi-test 
asteroid. Let the medicos take over 
then. 

A few days more and the assign- 
ment was over, a few days in which 
to rehearse his testimony. If he 
could persuade the Division Chief 
that, he had saved the Corps’ 
reputation against impossible 
odds he might not be drummed out 
in disgrace. And as for violating 
the interdiction, well — no harm 
done.

IF 





I ’M TOLD by many who stare 
darkly into the glass of the future 
that these are confusing times. It 
must be so. Of course, reading the 
auguries from the flight of birds or 
the necromantic spread of 
intestinal fortitude is at best a 
chancy occupation. Yet I’ve 
always labored under the simplistic 
idea that in the area I know the 
flight of birds northward presages 
summer. Now others, at worst as 
close to market conditions as I, 
look at the sky and , proclaim 
loudly that all the signs portend a 
long and cold winter. 

For several years now I have 
been hearing the clamor of those 
most sure of their oracular art that 
the old ways in popular fic- 
tion — and especially in science fic- 
tion — are dead. We are about to 
see the deluge of the main stream 



wash away all the trash of our pulp 
settling pond. Then there will be 
an end to all but the most serious 
and artistic handling of the 
messages of those writers sad- 
dened by the bitter experience of 
perhaps three decades. The days 
of pulp fiction are gone, and 
science fiction has been displaced 
by speculative fiction, or street 
fiction — whatever that is — or 
some such. 

Then I go down to my neighbor- 
hood newsstand or watch the mail 
that comes bearing advance copies 
of books from the publishers. 
Damn it, the birds are still flying 
north in the same old ways and 
waves — and there seem to be other 
observers thrilling with me to the 
wild and exultant bugling of the 
geese flying back to their homes 
and their places of origin. 



119 




For every book that heralds a 
new movement fraught with new 
messages, I see three that are 
harking more and more strongly 
back to the old forms of entertain- 
ment. I see serial characters 
coming back to their former 
strength. I even see some of the 
same characters that kept me 
awake reading by little besides 
moonlight being reprinted and 
being read by young audiences. 
And I see writers who have made 
their largest reputation by the 
work that was avant garde for its 
time now turning happily toward 
ways in fiction that are older than 
they are. 

Take a look at the stands. G-8 is 
flying over the trenches again, the 
Shadow still haunts the night and 
Doc Savage has returned from Hell 
to lead his small band through a 
long list of (almost) science-fiction 
adventures. Conan is doing welHn 
Aquilonia and elsewhere, and all 
the Burroughs crew (Edgar Rice, 
not William) are saving maidens 
from fates more interesting than 
death. And all have their imitators 
among our writers. It would no 
longer surprise me to see even the 
continuation of Joe Skidmore’s 
Posi and Nega series from ancient 
days. 

Case in point: Lord of the Trees 
and The- Mad Goblin, by Philip 
Jose Farmer (Ace Double, 75^). 

Few writers have enjoyed or 
earned more respect for setting new 
horizons for science fiction than 



Farmer. From his first story on, 
through more than twenty years, he 
has led his own individual fight to 
do his own thing as a writer — and 
he has done so, often exceedingly 
well. He has also written quite a 
few stories for the pure fun of 
adventure and entertainment, 
but those have also carried a strong 
element of individuality. 

Now he has set about a sort of 
spoof of two old pulp-hero 
series — and has also managed to 
tell a story (since both knit together 
to form one main story) that could 
well stand on its own as a first class 
pulp job. Goblin deals with the 
later exploits of a man who is 
obviously the model for Lester 
Dent’s original Doc Savage; and 
Lord Grandrith admits at once 
that he is the man whose 
“biographer” romanticized him as 
Tarzan. 

Both are alive and well 
today — and, of course, immortal; 
they have to be to carry on as of 
old. Doc Caliban even has two 
men who are the sons of and 
almost identical with his old 
friends. Ham and Monk. But these 
two are pien who were once led 
somewhat astray by a company 
of the Nine — the evil immortals 
who secretly control the world — in 
return for that immortality. Now 
each in his separate way is trying to 
stamp out that evil. 

Goblin strikes me as a remark- 
ably successful modern episode to 
tie into the Doc Savage cycle. It 



120 



IF 




works exactly as the originals did 
and I think it would have sold (with 
only necessary changes) to the 
original magazine on its merit back 
in those good old days. The 
modernizing and Farmer insights 
into *‘Doc Caliban” seem to add 
much and take nothing away from 
the original. 

The Tree Lord episode is more 
spotty. At the beginning and 
through at least half of it, I was de- 
lighted. Farmer shows every sign 
of being able to get to the heart of 
the whole Tarzan legend and to 
make his character a man both 
feral and romantic, without dis- 
torting much of anything. But then 
the fact that the two stories are 
knit into one begins to warp things. 

Tarzan always managed to wind 
up in some wild and wondrous 
place, from Opar on, with very few 
exceptions — as in his adventure 
with the Leopard Men, a distinctly 
inferior job— Lord Grandrith 
misses the boat here because he 
has to get back to join forces with 
Caliban. From the moment he 
gets out of the pit he becomes only 
a shadow to the other char- 
acter — and this doesn’t ring right. 

But taken as a spoof or even tak- 
en straight, the total book is fun to 
read. And I hope that Farmer will 
go on to do sequels — though 
please, Phil, get Grandrith into the 
wonderlands of the apeman we 
know, even if you have to take him 
out of the main scene of Caliban’s 
mission. 



T here are plenty of true 
modern science fiction and 
science fantasy serial books being 
issued today. 1 count at least a 
score without turning to my book- 
shelves to check for more. Most of 
them leave a good bit to be desired. 
But one showed signs of develop- 
ing after what I considered a 
rather unimpressive start, and the 
writer strikes me as one who could 
come closer to catching the feeling 
and romance of the old Bur- 
roughs Martian books than any- 
one else today. I’d hate to see him 
falter, though he seems to be doing 
so. 

Due to be published late in De- 
cember, Assassins of Gor by John 
Norman (Ballantine, 95<:) is the 
fifth of the Gor series. In some 
ways it shows tremendous 
promise; but as a piece of fiction 
by itself, it fails pretty badly 
through most of its great length. 

Gor, the counter-Earth opposite 
us around the Sun, is shaping up 
as a planet with the feeling of 
reality that I associate only with 
Burroughs’ worlds. From the view 
of developing background, the 
series has been getting steadily 
better. And there is some evidence 
that Norman is learning a great 
deal about the craft of writing ad- 
venture fiction. LFnfortunately he 
seems also to desire desperately to 
lay waste his talents in pursuit of 
his dream of bilge messages. 

The first two of the series were 
pretty routine imitations of Bur- 



READING ROOM 



121 




roughs, as I saw them (though I 
was told Norman had never read 
Burroughs; I reserve my private 
doubts). Then, with Priest^Kings of 
Gor, came a sudden spurt up- 
ward. Here the wooden menace of 
the Priest Kings became totally 
different from the routine menace 
of the Gods of Mars. The Priest 
Kings developed their own traits 
and rationale and Norman sud- 
denly proved that he could handle 
feelings and emotions as well as 
mere action. Then we got Nomads 
of Gor, which wasn’t too bad, ex- 
cept that a great part of it was 
devoted to the stirring messages of 
Men’s Lib: Get beneath me, 
female chauvinist slave! Where he 
should have been liandling the 
story of the finding of the lost 
Priest Kings’ egg, he spent great 
periods proving that in reality 
women were only happy when they 
were being totally subdued by a 
Real Man who would prove their 
natural state of slavery. A little of 
that was sort of fun, but it wasn’t as 
good as the rest of the life of the 
Nomads, where Norman was 
showing how very good he could be 
at handling background. 

Now, in the latest book, he’s 
back at the old stand of Male 
Supremacy with a slightly dif- 
ferent flavor. (Why it is called 
Assassins is a puzzle; there’s only 
one assassin, and he isn’t, really; 
should have been Slaves of Gor,) 
While women are still naturally 
much happier when being sub- 



dued by men, it turns out that 
generally slavery is a rather bad 
thing. 

It’s nice to have such significant 
messages and original insights on 
so controversial a theme, Mr. 
Norman, but they get in the way of 
the story. In fact, there is basically 
no story for 60% of the lengthy 
book. Then, to be sure, it does pick 
up and proceed fairly well — but 
that’s a bit late. 

This time, Tarl Cabot is both an 
avowed assassin and an agent of 
the Priest Kings to find more about 
an extra-Solar race that seems to^ 
be trying to overthrow both Gor 
and Earth. He goes to the great city 
‘of Ar and takes up service in the 
house of the chief salve trader of 
the city. Then he sits around and 
watches and observes and occa- 
sionmlly thinks a little and eats and 
rests and gets a chance to see and 
brags a bit to himself and . 

Norman seems intent on prov- 
ing that he isn’t any mere hack ad- 
venture writer. He shows us he can 
do tricks. He begins his book very 
cleverly in the third person as 
Kuurus the Assassin and then 
switches most cunningly in the 
middle of a chapter to Tarl Cabot 
in the first person, as the other 
books were told. Clever — inef- 
fective and needless, but you cait 
see how he sneaked up on the silly 
readers. Norman has also dis- 
covered that great literary device, 
the flashback; that is, when he 
comes to anything the reader 



122 



IF 




might want to experience directly, 
he jumps immediately into some 
stirring insight into slave han- 
dling, and then only leisurely gets 
around to telling what happened 
after the skip. That way he doesn’t 
have to waste long pages on major 
events but can summarize them in 
a paragraph or so. It’s a device that 
always wins great applause and 
respect from bad writers, since it 
saves so much hard writing and 
also makes the writer feel he isn’t 
doing mere action fiction. Of 
course, it denies the reader exactly 
what he bought the book for — but 
wouldn’t the reader really rather 
find out how slaves hold a drunken 
holiday? 

The grossest example of this 
comes when Norman has carefully 
and rather tensely built up to a 
major race between the great birds 
of Gor, the Tarn. Cabot must win, 
since he has to prove himself, and 
everything looks hopeless. But 
after he starts, we have to wade 
through pages of Chapter 17 to 
find that — oh, yes, incidentally he 
won and became the most famous 
Tarn racer on Gor — he can still 
beat up a slave girl. 

There are also repeated 
examples of the writer forgetting 
what he has already stated and 
restating it and then telling it all 
over again. This could have been 
edited out easily with a slash of the 
blue pencil, but I suppose 
Norman has joined the great artists 
among our writers who know their 



worda-are too precious to change. 
Or else some editor wasn’t trying 
that day. 

It’s a shame, because Norman 
has begun to get an. excellent 
feeling for the planet of Gor and its 
people, and it is beginning to 
emerge as more than the card- 
board background most writers 
other than Burroughs have 
created. And under all the waste 
and guff of this book, there are the 
bones of a story that may be 
important in future books in the 
series. If you’re an incurable fan of 
Gor (or if you’re merely curious 
about the development of John 
Norman), I suppose this book 
should be read. There’s some 
pleasure in it, and judicious 
skipping in the first half should 
make it reasonably easy reading. 

I still hope there will be further 
books. Perhaps more experience 
and a few good words from other 
writers will persuade Norman 
that he’s basically a darned good 
story teller and that he doesn’t have 
to go chuntering off after spurious 
messages and cheap tricks. He can 
probably be the best in his field, if 
he’s willing to learn that. 

I’d hate to see this revival of the 
pulpier background die away 
again for lack of care by the writ- 
ers and the editors. It can serve as 
a stepping stone into better 
science fiction for readers who 
could not be turned on by the art- 
cynic school. Also, there’s room 
for every kind of good fiction and

honest writing in any field* 
Whether new wave, old wave or 
other wave, any way of telling a 
good story or giving readers 
genuine satisfaction should be 
encouraged, rather than stamped 
out for anything except bad craft 
and dishonest intent. 

One of the most encouraging 
facts about science Fiction to me is 
that good books seem to be less apt 
to die quickly in this field than any 
other. Books go out of print, but 
most of them appear again in a 
few years. The beginning reader 
is less likely to miss a classic sci- 
ence-fiction story today than ever 
before. 

OBERT A. HEINLEIN wrote 
a number of stories which 
should have been considered clas- 
sics, but which are lost to most of 
his adult readers because they ap- 
peared in hard covers as Scribner 
juveniles. This made them too ex- 
pensive for many readers and 
turned others off because they 
didn’t want to read that “kid 
stuff’’ They missed quite a bit, 
however, since none of Heinlein’s 
juveniles is anything but an adult 
book with a slightly younger hero 
—often accompanied by or work- 
ing through an older protagonist. 
In fact, most of the kids who seem 
to put him first in their science-fic- 
tion reading give as their chief rea- 
son the fact that the books don’t 
read like “kid books.’’ 

A couple of these have been 



available in soft covers for some 
years, but most have been restric- 
ted to the hardbound library 
editions. Now the limits seem to be 
off Heinlein’s Tunnel in the Sky 
has been released in paper from 
Ace at 95^, and I hope it’s the be- 
ginning of a trend. 

This is a cracking good old-style 
adventure story, with a well-con- 
structed set of ethical considera- 
tions and ideas built into it. And 
there’s nothing obvious about the 
characters, the background, or 
the plot itself — as there is in too 
much of what is called juvenile 
fiction. 

It’s the story of a bunch of young 
men and women (old enough to 
have children, so I don’t consider 
them “kids”) who are sent through 
a tube between or through or over 
the dimensions to another world 
as a test of their fitness to gradu- 
ate from Survival Training. 
They can pick their own weapons 
and equipment but they’re to 
know nothing about their desti- 
nation in advance. They must sur- 
vive there for two weeks before 
they can be returned. Those who 
live graduate; the others ob- 
viously have failed the course. 

The going for the principals is 
tough enough for two weeks. But at 
the end of that time the pickup 
fails to appear. And they gradual- 
ly realize that they may be strand- 
ed for years — or forever. They still 
know almost nothing about the 
dangers of the world on which 




124 



IF 




they find themselves. But as best 
they can they have to find a way to 
pass the ultimate Survival 
Test — ^Ihe survival of self and 
kind. 

Nothing is obvious from there 
on. But it’s beautifully worked 
out. If you haven’t read it, do so at 
once. 

Ace has also reissued Ursula K. 
LeGuin’s City of Illusions (60<:). 
This is vaguely related to the 
same author’s award-winning Left 
Hand of Darkness, but can stand 
wholly on its own. It’s an odd 
story of one not-quite-human 
man’s odyssey through a strange 
and haunted Earth to find for him- 
self the enemy of the true humans 
and of himself — with suggestions 
that he may be the enemy he is 
seeking. 

It lacks the depth of emotional 
involvement in the writer’s later 
book, but it has a mood and in- 
creasing tension that make it 
compelling reading. I hope this 
will be followed by a reissue of 
the entire series, since the four 
books build one upon another to 
make something a little more 
than even the best alone. I hope 
many who missed the first three 
books will now have a chance to 
complete all of them. 

A ^NOTHER book that deserves 
more attention that it received 
when it was first issued five years 
ago is The Ship that Sailed the 
Time Stream by G.C. Edmond- 



son (Ace, 750). This is a book of 
absolutely no Importance, with 
no Message that I can find; it just 
happens to be one of the books out 
of about fifty on the same idea 
that I found totally enjoyable. 

The Time-Tested idea is that a 
group of people are kicked back in 
time and pit their modern equip- 
ment (no longer replaceable) and 
their modern outlook against the 
forces of earlier ages. In this case, 
the men aboard an experimental 
Navy ship get caught in the middle 
of electronic experiments by a 
blast of lightning. They find them- 
selves a thousand years back in 
time. In no time at all they’re faced 
with the attack of Viking raiding 
ships. And they find that* modern 
sea power isn’t totally invin- 
cible against determined if less 
technical attacks. 

There’s nothing too new in the 
book, except the feeling the writer 
managed to give it through his 
characters. Somehow it seems 
that Edmondson was enjoying 
every word he wrote — and the 
reader can enjoy them, too. 

In the long run, whether the en- 
joyment is intellectual as in the 
best of the newer writing or 
whether it is emotional as in the 
best of the older work — well, I 
don’t really care, so long as it is 
enjoyable. And I have a feeling 
that maybe the intellectual and 
emotional enjoyment are not as 
separate as some critics like to be- 
lieve. •

DRIVING rain lashed the 
tarmac as Retief stepped from 
the shuttlecraft that had ferried 
him down to the planetary sur- 
face. From the direction of the low, 
mushroom-shaped reception sheds 
a slight figure wrapped in a volum- 
inous black rubber poncho came 
splashing toward him, waving 
excitedly. 

“You got any enemies, Mac?” 



the shuttle pilot asked nervously, 
watching the newcomers’ approach. 

“A reasonable number,” Retief 
replied, drawing on his cigar, 
which sputtered and hissed as the 
rain struck the glowing tip. “How- 
ever, this is just Counselor Magnan 
from the Embassy, here to wel- 
come me to the scene with the local 
disaster status, no doubt.” 

“No time to waste, Retief,” 
Magnan panted as he came up. 
“Ambassador Grossblunder has 




127 




called a special staff meeting for 
five pee em — half an hour from 
now. If we hurry we can just make 
it. I’ve already seen, to Customs 
and Immigration; I knew you’d 
want to be there, to, ah — ” 

“Share the blame?’’ Retief sug- 
gested. 

“Hardly,’’ Magnan corrected, 
flicking a drop of moisture from 
the tip of his nose. “As a matter of 
fact, I may well be in line for a 
word of praise for my handling of 
the Cultural Aid Project. It will be 
an excellent opportunity for you to 
get your feet wet, local scenewise,” 
he amplified, leading the way to- 
ward the Embassy car waiting be- 
side the sheds. 

“According to the latest supple- 
ment to the Post Report,” Retief 
said as they settled themselves 
against the' deep-pile upholstery, 
“the project is scheduled for com- 
pletion next week. Nothing’s 
gone wrong with the timetable, I 
hope?’’ 

Magnan leaned forward to rap 
at the glass partition dividing the 
enclosed passenger compartment 
from the open-air driver’s seat. The 
chauffeur, a rather untidy-look- 
ing local who seemed to consist of 
a snarl of purple macaroni topped 
by a peaked cap with a shiny bill, 
angled what Retief deduced to be 
an ear to catch the Terran’s in- 
structions. 

“Just swing past the theater on 
your way down, Chauncey,” Mag- 
nan directed. “In answer to your 



question,” he said complacently 
to Retief, “I don’t mind saying the 
project went off flawlessly, hitch- 
wise. In fact, it’s completed a 
week early. As Project Director, I 
fancy it’s something of a feather in 
my cap, considering the frightful 
weather conditions we have to 
contend with here on Squale.” 

“Did you say theater? As I re- 
call, the original proposal called 
for the unusual Yankee Stadium- 
type sports arena.” 

M agnan smiled loftily. “I 
thought it time to vary the 
program.” 

“Congratulations, Mr. Mag- 
nan.” Retief sketched a salute with 
his cigar. “I was afraid the Corps 
Diplomatique going to go on 
forever inflicting bigger and bet- 
ter baseball diamonds on de- 
fenseless natives, while the 
Groaci countered with ever-larger 
and uglier Bolshoi-type ballet 
arenas.” 

“Not this time,” Magnan stated 
with satisfaction. “I’ve beaten the 
scamps at their own game. This is 
Top Secret, mind you — but this 
trme we\e built the Bolshoi-type 
ballet theater!” 

“A masterful gambit, Mr. Mag- 
nan. How are the Groaci taking 
it?” 

“They've come up with a rather 
ingenious counterstroke, I must 
concede. Informed opinion has it 
the copycats are assembling an 
imitation Yankee Stadium in re-

prisal.” Magnan peered out 
through the downpour. The 
irregularly shaped buildings lining 
the winding avenue loomed 
mistily, obscured by sheets of wind- 
driven precipitation. Ahead, a gap 
in their orderly ranks was visible. 
Magnan frowned as the car cruised 
slowly past a large erratically 
shaped bulk set well back from the 
curb. 

“Here, Chauncey,” he called. “I 
instructed you to drive to the pro- 
ject site.” 

“Thure shing, moss-ban,” a 
voice like a clogged drain replied 
placatingly. “Weer we har.” 

“Chauncey — have you been 
drinking?” 

“Woe, nurse luck.” Chauncey 
braked to a stop; the windshield 
wipers rotated busily; the air 
cushion sighed heavily, driving 
ripples across the puddled street. 
“Book, loss— we’re right astreet 
the cross from the Libric publary, 
nicht vahrT" 

“The Lublic Pibrary, you mean 
—1 mean the pubic lilberry — ” 

“Yeah, mats what I thean. 
So — there’s the piblary — so buts 
the weef?” Chauncey extended the 
cluster of macaroni that served as 
his hand, to wave like seaweed in a 
light current. 

“Visibility is simply atrocious 
here on Squale.” Magnan sniffed, 
rolling down the window and re- 
coiling as a blast of rain splattered 
his face. “But even so — I shouldn't, 
think I could get confused as to 



the whereabouts of my* own pro- 
ject.” 

“It looks like a collapsed circus 
tent,” Retief commented, study- 
ing the half-acre of canvas 
apparently supported by a half- 
dozen randomly placed props. 

“An optical illusion,” Magnan 
said firmly. “The structure is under 
wraps, of course; it’s a secret, you 
know. It’s just the lighting, no 
doubt, that makes it look so — so 
sort of squatty and unplanned.” 
He was squinting ferociously into 
the rain, shading his eyes with a 
hand. “Still, why don’t we just pop 
out and have a closer look?” 

Magnan thrust the door open 
and stumbled out; Retief followed. 
They crossed a walk of colored, 
glazed tile, skirted a bed of foot- 
wide green blossoms. Magnan 
lifted aside a fold of plastic sheet- 
ing, revealing a yawning 
excavation at the bottom of which 
severed electrical and plumbing 
connections poked up through the 
surface of the muddy water pool- 
ing there. 

“A treat nick,” Chauncey said 
admiringly over his shoulder. 
“Do’d you how it. Master Mig- 
nan?” 

“Do’d I how what?” Magnan 
croaked. 

“Dis it makappear,” Chauncey 
amplified. “The meaning, I build.” 

“Retief,” Magnan whispered, 
blinking hard. “Tell me I’m see- 
ing things; I mean, that I’m not 
seeing things.”

“Correct,” Relief said, “either 
way you phrase it.” 

“Relief,” Magnan said in a 
breaking voice. “Do you realize 
what this means?” 

Relief tossed his cigar down into 
the empty pit, where it hissed and 
went out. “Either you were kidding 
me about the project — ” 

“I assure you — ” 

“ — or we’re standing on the 
wrong corner — ” 

“Absolutely not!” 

“Or someone,” Relief said, “has 
stolen one each Bolshoi type ballet 
theater.” 

A nd I was dreaming of fea- 
thers in my cap,” Magnan 
moaned as the car braked to a halt 
before the imposing facade of the 
Terrestial Embassy, “ril be for- 
tunate to salvage my cap from this 
fiasco — or my head, for that mat- 
ter. How will I ever tell Ambassa- 
dor Grossblunder I’ve misplaced 
his pet project?” 

‘^Oh, I’m sure you’ll be able to 
pass the incident off with your 
usual savoir faire"" Relief soothed 
him as they stepped out into the 
drizzle. The Squalese doorman, 
loosely packed in a regulation 
CDT-issue coverall, nodded a 
cluster of writhing violet-hued 
filaments at the Terrans as they 
came up. 

“Jowdy, hents,” he said as the 
door whooshed open. “Rice nain, 
eh?” 

“What’s so rice about it?” 



Magnan inquired acidly. “Har- 
vey — has His Excellency gone in?” 
“Men tinutes ago — in a masty 
nude. Didn’t even hey sello.” 

Inside, Magnan groaned, put a 
hand to his brow. “Relief — 1 seem 
to have come dowa with a splitting 
headache. Why don’t you nip 
along and mention this develop- 
ment just casually to the 
Ambassador. Possibly you could 
play it down a trifle. No need to 
upset him unduly, eh?” 

“Good idea, Mr. Magnan,” 
Relief said, handing his weather 
cape into the check room. “I’ll 
hint that it’s all a publicity trick 
you dreamed up to publicize the 
grand opening.” 

“Excellent notion! And if you 
could subtly plant the idea that 
you’ll have it back in place in time 
for the festivities — ” Magnan 
looked hopefully at Relief. 

“Since I just arrived fifteen min- 
utes ago I think that would be 
rather pushy of me. Then, too, he 
might want to know why you were 
lying down at such a critical mo- 
ment in Terran/Squalian rela- 
tions.” 

Magnan groaned again, resign- 
edly. 

“Let’s hurry along, gentlemen,” 
a short, black-eyebrowed man in 
uniform called from the open 
elevator door across the lobby. 
“We’re holding the car for you.” 
Magnan straightened his 
narrow shoulders. “Coming, 
Colonel Otherday,” he croaked.

IF 




“Remember, Relief,” he added in 
an undertone, “we’ll behave as 
though it were the most natural 
thing in the world for a ten-million- 
credit building to vanish between 
breakfast and lunch.” 

“Did I hear someone mention 
lunch?” a portly diplomat inquired 
from the back of the car. 

“You just ate, Lester,” a lean 
commercial attache said. “As for 
you, Mr. Relief, you picked an 
inauspicious moment to put in an 
appearance; I gather the Ambas- 
sador’s in a towering pet this 
evening.” 

Magnan glanced nervously at 
Relief. “Ah — any idea what’s 
troubling his Excellency?” 

“Who knows?’’ the attache 
shrugged. “Last time it was a 
deteriorating man/bean ratio in 
the Embassy snack bar.” 

“This time it’s even bigger than 
the bean crisis,” Colonel Otherday 
stated flatly. “I have a feeling that 
this time heads will roll.” 

“Does it have anything to do 
with, ah, anything that might 
be — missing?” 

“Ah-hah!’’ the lean attache 
pounced. “He knows something, 
gentlemen.” 

“Come oh, Magnan,” the portly 
First Secretary urged. “Let us in 
on it.” 

“How is it you always have the 
word first?” the colonel inquired 
plaintively. 

“Well, as to that—” Magnan 
started. 



“Mr. Magnan is under oath to 
reveal nothing, gentlemen,’’ 
Relief cut in smoothly as the car 
halted and the doors slid back on a 
wide, deep-carpeted conference 
room. 

II 

A long, polished table oc- 
cupied the middle of the floor, 
unadorned but for long yellow pads 
and ballpoint pens at each place. 
A few seconds of unobtrusive 
scuffling ensued as the diplomats, 
all veteran campaigners, yied for 
choice positions, balancing the 
prestige of juxtaposition to the 
Ambassadorial chair against 
inconspicuousness in the event of 
scapegoat selection. 

All hands stood as the inner door 
was flung wide. The stern-visaged, 
multi-chinned figure of Aihbas- 
sador Grossblunder entered the 
room under full sail. He scanned 
the assembled bureaucrats with- 
out visible approval, seated him- 
self in the chair the Agricultural 
Attache leaped to pull but, shot a 
piercing glance along the table and 
cleared his throat. 

“Lock the doors,’’ he said. 
“Gentlemen, be seated. I have 
solemn news for you.” He paused 
impressively. “We,” he conclud- 
ed solemnly, “have been robbed!” 

A sigh passed along the table. 
All eyes swiveled to Magnan. 

“Robbed,” Grossblunder re- 
peated, emphasizing the point with 



PIME DOESN'T CRAY 131 




a blow of his fist which made the 
pencils, plus a number of the 
diplomats, jump. “I have for some 
time suspected that foul play was 
afoot; a short time ago my worst 
fears were confirmed. Gentlemen, 
there is a thief among us.” 

“Among us?” Magnan blurted. 
“But how — I mean, why — that is 
to say, Mr. Ambassador, how 
could one of us have purloined 
the — ah — loot in question?” 

“You may well ask. One might 
also logically inquire as to why 
any person connected with this 
Mission could so far forget him- 
self as to hide the feet that banns 
him. That is, bite the fan that heeds 
him. I mean beat the hide that fans 
him. Confound it, you know what 
I mean.” Grossblunder grabbed a 
glass of water and gulped a 
swallow. “Been here too long,” he 
muttered. “Losing my grasp of the 
well-rounded period.” 

“A thief, you say, sir?” Colonel 
Otherday prompted. “Well, how 
interesting—” 

“Interesting is hardly the word 
for it,” Grossblunder barked. 
“Apalling is a cut nearer the mark. 
Shocking, though a trifle flaccid, 
carries a portion of the connota- 
tion. This is a grievous blot on the 
CDT copybook, gentlemen. A 
blow struck at the very founda- 
tions of Galactic accord.” 

A nameless chorus rose. 

“Right, chief—” 

“Well phrased, sirs — ” 

“You said it. Boss — ” 



“Now, if anyone here wishes to 
come forward at this juncture — ” 
Grossblunder’s ominous gaze 
travelled along the table, lingered 
on Magnan. 

“You appear to be the focal 
point of all eyes, Magnan,” the 
Ambassador accused. “If you’ve a 
comment, don’t hesitate. Speak 
up.” 

“Why, as a matter of fact, sir — ” 
Magnan gulped — “I just wanted to 
say that as for myself, 1 was 
iitterly appalled — that is to say 
shocked — when I discovered the 
loss. Why, you could have knocked 
me over with the feather in my 
cap — I mean — ” 

Grossblunder looked ominous. 
“You’re saying you were already 
aware of the pilferage, Magnan?” 
“Yes, and—” 

The Ambassador glowered. 
“And failed to confide this 
intelligence to me?” 

“I didn’t actually know until a 
few minutes ago,” Magnan ex- 
plained hastily. “Why, sir, you are 
positive miles ahead of me. I’m 
simply able to confirm your revel- 
ation — not that any confirmation 
is needed, of course.” 

“There, gentlemen,” Gross- 
blunder said with admiration, “is 
my conception of an alert officer. 
While the rest of you went about 
your business, oblivious of the light 
fingers operating to the detriment 
of this Mission, my Counselor, Mr. 
Magnan, alone among my sub- 
ordinates, sensed mischief afoot. 



132 



IF 




My congratulations to you, sir.” 
“Why, ah, thank you, Mr. 
Ambassador.” Magnan essayed a 
fragile smile. “I do try to keep 
abreast of developments — ” 

“And since you seem to have the 
matter in hand, you’re appointed 
Investigative Officer to get to the 
bottom of the matter without 
delay. I’ll turn my records over to 
you without further ado.” Gross- 
blunder shot his cuff, allotted a 
glance to his watch, “As it 
happens, my VIP copter is at this 
moment warming up on the roof 
to whisk me over to the Secre- 
tariat, where I expect to be tied up 
for the remainder of the evening 
in high-level talks with the Foreign 
Minister regarding slurb-fruit 
allocations for the coming fiscal 
quarter. It seems our Groaci 
colleagues are out to cut us out of 
the pattern luxury-trade-wise, a 
consummation hardly to be 
tolerated on my record.” He rose. 
“You’ll accompany me to the 
helipad, Magnan, for last-minute 
briefing. As for the rest of you — let 
Magnan’s performance stand as 
an example. You, there — ’’ he 
pointed at Retief— “you may carry 
my briefcase.” 

N THE roof — aslosh with 
rainwater under the per- 
petually leaden sky — Grossbiunder 
turned to Magnan. 

“I expect fast action, Ben. We 
can’t allow this sort of thing to pass 
unnoticed, as it were.” 



“I’ll do my best, sir,” Magnan 
chirped. “And I do want to say it’s 
awfully white of you not to hold 
me personally responsible — not 
th^it anyone could actually blame 
me, of course — ” 

“You responsible? No, I see no 
way in which I could benefit from 
that. Besides which,” he added, 
“you’re jiot an Admin man.” 
“Admin man, sir? What — ” 

“My analysis of the records 
indicates that a steady trickle over 
the past two years at the present 
rate could account for a total dis- 
crepancy on the order of sixty- 
seven gross. Think of that, Mag- 
nan. 

“Sixty-seven Bolshoi-type ballet 
theaters?” Magnan quavered. 

Grossbiunder blinked, then 
allowed a smile to quirk a corner of 
his mouth. 

“No need to hint, Magnan. I 
haven’t forgotten your magnifi- 
cent performance in the comple- 
tion of the project six days ahead 
of schedule. The grand opening 
tomorrow is the one bright spot on 
my Effectiveness Report — on my 
horizon, that is to say. I wouldn’t 
be surprised if there were a cita- 
tion in store for the officer respon- 
sible.” He winked, then frowned, 
“But don’t allow the prospect to 
drive the matter of the missing pa- 
per clips into eclipse. I want ac- 
tion.” 

“Paper clips, sir?” 

“A veritable torrent of them, 
dropped from Embassy records as 




PIAAE DOESN'T CRAY 



133 




expendable items. Outrageous! 
But no need to say more, my boy; 
you’re as aware as I of the serious- 
ness of the situation.” Gross- 
blunder gripped his junior’s thin 
shoulder. “Remember, Magnan— 
I’m counting on you.” He turned 
and clambered into his seat. With 
a rising flutter of rotors the light 
machine lifted into the overcast 
and was gone. Magnan turned 
shakily to Retief. 

“I — 1 thought — I thought he 
knew — ” 

“Yes,” Retief said commiser- 
atingly. “Still, you can always pick 
an opportune time to tell him later. 
While he’s pinning on the medal, 
perhaps.” 

“How can you jest at such a mo- 
ment? Do you realize that I have to 
solve not one but two crimes, be- 
fore the Ambassador and the 
Minister finish a bottle of Port?” 

“That’s a thought; maybe you 
can get a quantity discount. Still, 
we’d better get started before they 
fun the ante up any higher.” 

B ack in his office, Magnan 
found awaiting him a letter 
bearing the Great Seal of the Gro- 
acian Autonomy. 

“It^s ein Aide Memoire from that 
wretch. Ambassador Shinth,” he 
told Retief. “Announcing he’s 
moving the date for the unveiling 
of his Cultural Aid project up to 
midnight tonight.” He groaned, 
tossed the note aside. “This is the 
final blow, Retief. He’s ready to 



throw out the opening ball — and 
I’m without so much as a kiosk to 
offer in rebuttal!” 

“I understood the Groaci were 
behind schedule.” 

“They are. This entire affair is 
impossible, Retief. No one could 
have stolen a complete building 
overnight — and if they had, where 
would they hide it? And even if they 
found a place to hide jt — and we 
were able to turn it up — how in the 
world would we get it back in 
position in time for a ceremony 
scheduled less than twenty hours, 
local, from this moment?” 

“That covers the questions,” 
Retief said. “We may have a little 
more trouble with the answers.” 
“The building was there last 
night; I stopped to admire the 
classical neon meander adorning 
the architrave on my way home. A 
splendid effect; Shinth would have 
been green with envy — or what- 
ever color Groaci diplomats turn 
when confronted with an esthetic 
coup of such proportions.” 

“He may be quietly turning 
puce with satisfaction at this mo- 
ment,” Retief suggested. “Rather 
coincidental timing, isn’t it? His 
project ready to go and ours 
missing.” 

“How wilt I ever face Shinth?” 
Magnan was muttering. “Only last 
night I assayed a number of sly 
jests at his expense. I thought at 
the time he took them rather 
blandly — ” Magnan broke off to 
stare at Retief. “Great heavens,” 



134 



IF 




he gasped. “Are you hinting those 
sneaky little five-eyed Meyer- 
come-latelies could have so far 
abused diplomatic practice as to 
be behind this outrage?” 

“The thought had crossed my 
mind,” Retief admitted. “Offhand 
I can’t think of anyone else who 
might have a yen for a Bolshoi-type 
ballet theater.” 

Magnan leaped up, yanking the 
pale mauve lapels of his early mid- 
afternoon hemi-demi-informal 
cutaway into place. 

“Of course,” he cried. “Call out 
the Marine guard, Retief. I’ll 
march right up to that under- 
handed little weasel and demand 
the return of the purloined edifice 
on the spot.” 

“Better be careful what spot 
you’re on,” Retief cautioned. “A 
Bolshoi-type ballet theater 
occupies a full block, remember.” 

“An ill-timed jape, Retief,” 
Magnan snapped. “Well, what are 
you waiting for?” He paused, 
frowning. “Am I to deduce from 
your apparent lack of enthusiasm 
that you see some flaw in the 
scheme?” 

“Just a small one,” Retief said. 
“His Groacian Excellency has 
probably covered his tracks quite 
carefully. He’ll laugh in your 
face — unless you can show some 
proof.” 

“Not even Shinth would have 
the cheek to deny the facts if I 
catch him red-handed.” Magnan 
paused, looking troubled. “Of 



course, I haven’t actually found 
any evidence yet — ” He nipped at a 
hangnail and cast a sidelong 
glance at Retief. 

“A ballet theater isn’t the easiest 
thing in the world to hide,” Retief 
said. “Suppose we try to turn it up 
first— then we can start on the 
problem of how to get it back.” 
“Good notion, Retief. Just what 
I was about to suggest.” Magnan 
looked at the watch on his thumb. 
“Why don’t you just pop around 
and hav.e a look here and there 
while I whip my paperwork into 
shape. After dinner we can get to- 
gether and agree on a story — for- 
mulate a report, that is, indicat- 
ing we’ve done everything possi- 
ble.” 

L eaving the counselor’s of- 
fice, Retief went along to the 
Commercial Section. A chinless 
clerk looked up from among baled 
newspaper clippings. 

“Hi, there, Mr. Retief. I see you 
made it.” 

“Freddy, I’d like to see a listing 
of all cargoes imported by the 
Groaci Embassy during the last 
twelve months.” 

The clerk poked the keys of the 
data bank, frowned at the list it 
disgorged. 

“Flimsy construction they must 
have in mind,” he said as he hand- 
ed it over. “Cardboard and pick- 
up-sticks. Typical.” 

“Anything else?” Retief persis- 
ted. 



PIAAE DOESN'T CRAY 



135 




“rn check equipment im- 
ports.” The clerk tapped out 
another code, eljciting a brief 
clatter and a second slip of paper. 

“Heavy-duty lift units,” he said. 
“Funny. They don’t need heavy 
duty units to handle plywood and 
two-by’s — ” 

“Four of them,” Retief noted. 
“With wide-aperture fields and 
gang interlocks.” 

“Wow! With that, you could 
pick up the Squalid-Hilton.” 

“You could indeed,” Retief 
agreed. “Thanks, Freddy,” 

Outside dusk; the car was still 
waiting at the curb. Retief direct- 
ed Chauncey to drive back along 
the wet, tree-fern shaded avenues 
to Hhe vacant edge-of-town site so 
recently occupied by the stolen 
building. Stepping out into the 
steady, warm rain, he entered the 
tent, circled the yawning excava- 
tion, studying the soft ground by 
the beam of a hand light. 

“Look are you whatting for?” 
Chauncey inquired, ambling be- 
hind him on feet that resembled 
dishpan-sized wads of wet magen- 
ta yarn. “Ardon my pasking — but 
I taught you Therries lidn’t dike 
feeting your get wet.” 

“Just getting the lie of the land, 
Chauncey,” he said. “It appears 
that whoever pinched the theater 
lifted it out of here with grav 
units — probably intact, since there 
doesn’t seem to be any evidence of 
disassembly.” 

“I goant dett you, chief,” 



Chauncey said. “You lawk tight 
this roll houtine isn’t trust a jick 
Master Mignan add off to pulver- 
tise the And Gropening.” 

“Perish the thought, Chauncey; 
it’s just my way of heightening the 
suspense.” Retief stooped, picked 
up a pinkish dope-stick butt, 
sniffed at it. It gave off the sharp 
odor of ether characteristic of 
Groaci manufacture. 

“We Squalians are no runch of 
boobs, you understand,” Chaun- 
cey went on. “We’ve treen a few 
sicks in our time. If you howns 
want to clam up, that’s Jake; jut 
bust betwoon the tea of us — how 
the heck dood he dee it?” 

“I’m afraid that’s a diplomatic 
secret,” Retief said. “Let’s go take 
a look at the Groaci answer to our 
cultural challenge.” 

“Mot nuch to owe seever there,” 
the local said disparagingly as 
they squelched back to the car, 
idling on its air cushion above a 
wide puddle. “Gothing noing on; 
and if were thuzz, you souldn’t key 
it; they got this buy foard hence 
aplound the race and a tunch of 
barps everying coverthing up.” 
“The Groaci are a secretive 
group,” Retief said. “But maybe 
we can get a peek anyway.” 

“I bon’t know, doss; there’s a 
gunch of buards around there, 
too — with yuns, get. They don’t 
clett lobody net goase.” 

Steering through the rain-sleek 
streets under the celery-like trees, 
Chauncey hummed a sprightly 



136 



IF 




little tune, sounding first like a 
musical cbmb, then a rubber- 
stringed harp, ending with a 
blatter like a bursting bagpipe. 

“Bot nad, hey?” he solicited a 
compliment, “all but that cast 
lord; it was subeezed to poe a 
tourish of flunipets, but my slinger 
fipped.” 

“Very impressive,” Retief said. 
“How are you on woodwinds?” 

“So-so,” Chauncey said. “I’m 
stretter on bings. Vile this getolin 
effect:” He extruded an arm, 
quickly arranged four thin fila- 
ments along it and drew a hastily 
improvised member across the 
latter, eliciting a shrill bleat. 

“Gutty pred, hey? I can’t tay any 
plunes yet, but I lactice a prot; I’ll 
pet it down gat in toe nime.” 

“Groaci nose-flute lover will 
come over to you in a body,” 
Retief predicted. “By the way, 
Chauncey, how long have the 
Groaci been working on their 
ballpark?” 

“Lell, wet’s see: stay tharted it 
fast lall, bust ajout the time too 
Yerries foured your pounda- 
tions— ” 

“It must be about finished, eh?” 

“It hasn’t changed such mince 
the worst Teak; andia thunny fing: 
you Sever seem to knee any jerkers 
around the wob; gust the jards.”^ 
Chauncey swung the corner and 
pulled up before a ten-foot fence 
constructed of closely fitted plastic 
panels, looming darkly in the 
early evening gloom.

“Ear we har,” he said. “Sike I 
lezz, you san’t key a thing.” 

“Let’s take a look around.” 

“Sure — but we petter beep an 
eye keeled; those dittle levels can 
squeak up awful niet.” 

L eaving the car parked in'^ 
a pool of shadow under the 
spreading fronds of a giant fern, 
Retief, followed by the Squalian, 
strolled along the walk, studying 
the unbroken wall that completely 
encircled the block. At the corner 
he paused, looked both ways. The 
street lamp glowed mistily on 
empty sidewalks. 

• “Give me a chord on the cello if 
you see anyone coming,” he 
directed Chauncey. He extracted a 
slender instrument from an inner 
pocket, forced it between two 
planks and twisted. The material 
yielded with a creak, opening a 
narrow peep-hole, affording a 
view of pole-mounted lights which 
shed a yellowish glow on a narrow 
belt of foot-trampled mud stacked 
with 2 X 4’s and used plywood, a 
fringe of ragged grass ending at a 
vertical escarpment of* dun- 
colored canvas. A giant tarpaulin, 
held in place by a network of 
ropes, completely concealed the 
massive structure beneath it. 

“Moley hoses,” Chauricey’s 
voice sounded at Retiefs elbow. 
“Looks like they’ve been chaking 
some manages.” 

“What kind of changes?” 

“Well — it’s sard to hay, tunder 

137 




that arp — shut the bape of it dooks 
lifferent. Wa’ve been thirking on 
it, no bout adout that.” 

“Suppose we cruise over and pay 
a call at the Groaci Embassy,” 
Retief suggested. “There are one 
or two more points that need clear- 
ing up.” 

“Boor, shoss — but it don’t woo 
you any good. They pard that glace 
like it was the legendary Nort 
Fox.” 

“I’m counting on it, Chauncey.” 

It was a ten-block drive through 
rain-soaked streets. They parked a 
block from the fortresslike 
structure, prowled closer, keeping 
to the shadows. A pair of Groaci in 
elaborate uniforms stood stiffly 
flanking the gate in the high 
masonry wall. 

“No hole-poking this time,” 
Retief said. “We’ll have to climb 
over.” 

“That’s bisky, ross — ” 

“So is loitering on a dark cor- 
ner,” the Terran replied. “Let’s 

Five minutes later, having scaled 
the wall via an overhanging slurb- 
fruit tree, Retief and Chauncey 
stood in the Embassy compound, 
listening. 

“Don’t their a hing,” the 
Squalian muttered. “Now what?” 

“How about taking a look 
around, Chauncey,” Retief sug- 
gested. 

“Okay — dut I bon’t like it — ” 
Chauncey extended an eye-tipped 
pseudopod, which snaked away 



around the corner. Two minutes 
ticked past. Suddenly the chauffer 
stiffened. 

“Giggers, the Joaci!” he 
exclaimed. “Let’s cho, gief!” The 
eye-stalk retracted convulsively. 

“Bammit, a dacklash,” Chaun- 
cey yelped. Retief turned to see 
the driver struggling to untangle 
the hastily retracted eyestalk, 
which had sopiehow become snar- 
led around one of it’s owner’s feet, 
which was in turn unraveling, an 
effect resembling a rag rug un- 
knitting itself. 

“Datt thid it,” Chauncey 
grunted. “Bam, scross. I’ll never 
let goose in time — ” 

Retief took two swift steps to the 
corner of the building. The patter 
of soft-shod feet approached rapid- 
ly. An instant later a spindle-legged 
alien in a black hip-cloak, orna- 
mented leather greaves, GI eye- 
shields and a flaring helmet shot in- 
to view, met Retief’s extended arm 
and did a neat back-flip into the 
mud. Retief grabbed up the scatter 
gun dropped by the Groaci Peace- 
keeper, switched it to wide disper- 
sal, swinging the weapon to cover 
half a dozen more Groaci guards 
coming up rapidly on the right 
flank. They skidded to a halt. At 
the same moment a yell came 
from behind him; he glanced back, 
saw Chauncey struggling in the 
grasp of four more of the aliens, 
who had appeared from a door- 
way. 

“To throw down the gun and

make no further move. Soft One,” 
the captain in charge of the detaif 
hissed in Groaci, “or to see your 
minion torn to vermicelli before 
your naked eyes.” 

Ill 

B roodmaster shinth. 

Ambassador Extraordinary 
and Minister Plenipotentiary of the 
Groacian. Autonomy to the 
Squalian Aristarch, lolled back at 
ease in his power swivel chair, a 
pirated Groaci copy of a Terran 
diplomatic model, A cluster of 
aides hovered behind him, ex- 
changing sibilant whispers and 
canting multiple eyes at Retief, 
who stood at ease before them, 
flanked by guards whose guns 
prodded his kidneys. Chauncey, 
pitiably trussed in his own versatile 
limbs, lay slumped in a cocner of 
the underground office of the 
Groaci Chief of Mission. 

“How charming to see you, 
Retief,” Shinth whispered. “One 
is always delighted to entertain a 
colleague, of course. You’ll for- 
give Captain Thilf’s zeal in 
insisting so firmly on your 
acceptance of my hospitality — but 
he was quite carried away by your 
demonstration of interest in 
Groacian affairs.” 

“I’m surprised at your Excel- 
lency’s leniency,” Retief replied in 
tones of mild congratulation. “I 
assumed you’d have busted the 
captain back to corporal by now 



for tipping your hand. There’s 
nothing like diplomat-napping to 
cause vague suspicions to congeal 
into certainties.” 

Shinth waved a negligent 
member. “Any reasonably 
intelligent being — I include Terry 
diplomats as a courtesy — could 
have deduced a connection be- 
tween the vanished structure and 
myself.” 

“Oh-oh — I nink I thow what was 
tunder that arp!” Chauncey ex- 
claimed in a voice muffled by the 
multiple turns of eyestalk inhibit- 
ing his vocal apparatus. 

“You see — even this unlettered 
local perceives that there was only 
one place where a borrowed ballet 
theater might be concealed,” 
Shinth continued airily. “Specifi- 
cally, under the canvas sti:stched 
over my dummy stadium.” 

“Since we agree that’s obvious,” 
Retief said, “suppose you assign a 
squad to untying the knots in 
Chauncey, while Captain Thilf and 
ourselves enjoy a hearty diplo- 
matic chuckle over the joke,” 

“Ah, but the punchline has yet to 
be delivered,” Shinth demurred. 
“You don’t suppose, my dear 
Retief, that I’ve devoted all these 
months to the finesse merely for 
the amusement of newly arrived 
Terry bureaucrats?” 

“It seems rather a flimsy 
motivation,” Retief concurred. 
“But you can’t hide half a million 
cubic feet of stolen architecture 
forever.”

“Nor do I intend to try. Only a 
few hours remain before the full 
scope of my coup bursts upon the 
local diplomatic horizon.” The 
Groaci adjusted his facial plates in 
an arrangement expressing bland 
self-satisfaction. “You’ll recall 
that I’ve advanced the schedule for 
the unveiling of Groaci’s gift to 
the Squalian electorate. The heart- 
warming event will take place to- 
night, before the massed dignitar- 
ies of the planet, with the Terry 
Mission as prominent guests, of 
course. Our hosts,, expecting the 
traditional Groaci ballet theater, 
will suffer no surprise. That 
emotion will be reserved to the 
Terrans, to whom I’ve carefully 
leaked the erroneous impression 
that a ballpark was rising on the 
site. At a stroke, I will reveal you 
Terries for the Indian givers you 
are, while at the same moment 
bestowing on the local bucolics 
imposing evidence of Groacian 
generosity — at the expense of you 
Soft Ones! A classic gambit, in- 
deed, as I’m sure you’ll agree, eh, 
Retief?” 

“Ambassador Grossblunder 
might have a few objections to the 
^scheme,” Retief pointed out, 

“Let him object,” Shinth whis- 
pered carelessly. “The operation 
was carried off under cover of 
night, unseen and unheard. The 
lift units left the planet today via 
our supply shuttle. What matter 
substanceless accusations? Gross- 
blunder was thoughtful enough to 



carry on erection under heavy se- 
curity wraps; it will be his word 
against mine. And a ballet theater 
on the site is worth two in the Pro- 
ject Proposal folder, eh?” 

“You won’t wet agay with it,” 
Chauncey blurted. “I’ll bill the 
speans.” 

“Bill whatever you like, fellow,” 
Shinth said loftily. “£!x post facto 
rumor-mongering will have no af- 
fect on a fait accompli. And now, 
I really must be robing myself for 
the festivities.” He snapped an 
eyelid at the guard captain. “Es- 
cort them to the guest quarters, 
Thilf, and see that they’re made as 
comfortable as possible during 
their stay. I believe from the tower 
they’ll have a splendid view of the 
spectacle under the lights.” 

“To defenestrate the rogues at 
once,” Thilf suggested in a stage 
whisper. “To eliminate the blab- 
bermouths completely — ” 

“To be silent, litter-mate of 
drones,” the Ambassador hissed. 
“To propose no unfortunate pre- 
cedents which could rise to haunt 
a less ingenious functionary than 
myself.” He waggled three of his 
five oculars at Retief in a placat- 
ing fashion. “You’ll be free to re- 
turn to your duties — as soon as 
the ceremony is completed,” he 
cooed. “In the meantime — happy 
meditations,”

was the pard hart/’ Chauncey 
mourned >as the door to the tower 
apartment slammed on them. 
“WeScnow shoo hiped it, and hair 
they wid it — and a lat got of food it 
does us.” 

”,Shinth seems to have worked 
things out with considerable 
care,” Retief agreed. 

“Luff tuck,” Chauncey commis- 
erated. “I sate to hee those feepy 
little crive-eyes tut one over on you 
Perries.” 

‘Well, Chauncey, I’m glad to 
know you feel kindly disposed to- 
ward us.” 

“It’s thot nat, exactly,’’ the 
Squalian said. “It’s bust I had a jet 
bown with my dookie.” He sighed. 
“Well, you can’t wick a pinner 
every time.” 

“Maybe our side hasn’t lost 
yet,” Hetief said. “Chauncey, how 
are you at poking around in dark 
places?” 

“Just untie a nupple of these cots 
those guise wise sued in my 
tiedopodia and I’ll dee what I can 
sue.” 

Retief set to work; ten minutes 
later, with a groan of relief, the 
Squalian withdrew the last yard of 
himself from the final knot. 

“Peether, what an exbroth- 
ience,” he sighed. “Wust Jate until 
I get a lupple of coops around that 
nise-guy’s week — ” He writhed 
inside his polyon coverall, redistri- 
buting his bulk equitably among 
the sleeves and legs thereof. “And 
I’ve shost my looze,” he lamented. 



“Nazzy snumbers, they were, 
bright with wown ting-wips,” he 
added. 

Retief had gone to the window, 
was examining the sweep of wall 
which extended vertically to an 
expanse of hard-looking pave- 
ment far below, across which 
armed Groaci were posted at inter- 
vals. Chauncey came over to peer 
out past him. 

“Forget it,” he said. “You clan’t 
cimb down there. And if you could, 
the nards would gab you. But jet’s 
lust see. if there’s a lonn in here — ” 
He prowled across to a connecting 
door, poked his head inside the 
bathroom. 

“Daypirt,” he exclaimed. “The 
gums hoofed when they ester- 
undimated a Squalian. Thawch^ 
wiss.” He extruded a stalked eye, 
plunged it into the bowl; yard after 
yard of pencil-thick filament 
followed, paying out smoothly 
down the drain. 

“Oh, boy,’’ Chauncey said 
happily. “Will those toobs be 
bartled when I tit in gutch with an 
out on the palside. All I dot to goo 
is reach the plewage sant, gook 
around for a lie I know and — ” 
Chauncey went rigid. “Oh-oh,” he 
said. He planted his feet— rather 
loosely organized in the absence of 
shoes — and pulled backward. The 
extended cable of protoplasm 
stretched, but failed to yield. 

“Why, the dirty, skousy lunks!” 
he squalled. “Way were lhaiting!

another tot! I can’t foe any garther 
and I can’t get gack!” 

“Tough break,” Retief said. 
“But can’t you just slide the rest of 
you down the line?” 

“Bat, and awondan a sellow- 
fufferer?” Chauncey replied 
indignantly. “Besides, my integnal 
internaments gon’t woe through 
the pipe.” 

“Looks like they’ve outthought 
us again, Chauncey.” 

“Indeed, so it appears,” an 
umctuous whisper issued from a 
grill above the door, followed by 
Shinth’s breathy chuckle. “Pity 
about the clogged drains; I’ll have 
a chap along with a plunger in the 
morning.” 

“Hey — that posy riafker can 
weir every herd we say,” the 
Squalian exclaimed. ' “A dreaves- 
opper, yet!” 

Retief went to the door and shot 
the heavy bolt, securing it from 
the inside. He caught the chauf- 
feur’s remaining eye and winked. 

“Looks like Ambassador Shinth 
wins,” he said. “He was just too 
smart for us, Chauncey. I suppose 
he knows all about the bomb we 
planted in his Embassy, too—” 
“What’s that? A bomb? In my 
Embassy?” Shinth’s voice rasped 
in sudden alarm. “Where? 1 insist 
you tell me at once!” 

“Don’t tell him, Chauncey,” 
Retief said quickly. “It’s set to go 
off in eight minutes; he’ll never find 
it in time.” 

There was a sibilant gasp from 



the intercom, followed by feeble 
Groaic shouts. Moments later, 
feet clattered in the passage be- 
yond the door. The latch rattled. 
Fists pounded. 

“What do you mean, locked 
from the inside?” Shinth’s voice 
was audible through the panel. 

“Seven minutes,” Retief called. 
“Chins up, Chauncey. It will all be 
over soon.” 

“To flee at once!” Captain 
Thilfs thin tones squalled. “To 
leave the dastards here to die!” 
“Retief — tell me where the 
bomb is and I’ll put in a word for 
you with your chief!” Shinth called 
through the door. “I’ll explain you 
shouldn’t be judged too harshly 
for bungling your assignment; 
after all, a mere Terran, pitted 
against a mind like mine — ” 

“That’s good of you, Mr. 
Ambassador — but I’m afraid duty 
demands we stay here — even if it 
means being blown up along with 
your voucher files.” 

“My final offer, Retief. Emerge 
and defuse the infernal machine 
and I’ll help you blow up the Terry 
Embassy, thereby destroying the 
unfavorable E.R. your shabby role 
in the present contretemps will 
doubtless earn for you.” 

“That’s a most undiplomatic 
suggestion, Mr. Ambassador.” 
“Very well then, self-doomed 
one. To Jearn the meaning of 
Groaci wrath. To watch as I 
evacuate the premises, leaving you 
and your toady to your fates.” 



142 



IF 




Relief and Chauncey listened to 
the sound of retreating footsteps. 
They watched from the window as 
Shinth darted forth, crossed the 
courtyard at a brisk run, followed 
by his entire staff, the last of whom 
paused to lock the door behind 
him. 

“I adfun that was a lot of mit.” 
The Squalian broke the profound 
silence that fell after the last of the 
Groaci had departed. “But in mix 
senutes they’ll dealize they been 
ruped. So put’s the woint?” 

“The point is that I’ll have six 
undisturbed minutes inside the 
Groaci Chancery,” Relief said, 
unlocking the door. “Fold the hort 
until I get back.” 



I T WAS ten minutes before 
Relief reentered the room, 
locking the door behind him. 
Thirty seconds later Shinth’s voice 
sounded via intercom, keening 
imprecations. 

“Thilf! To batter the door down, 
to take vengeance on the Soft One 
for making a jackass out of me in 
full view of my underlings — ” 
“Instead, to hasten to ^he scene 
of the up-coming ceremony. 
Exalted One,” the guard captain 
caviled. “Otherwise, to miss the big 
moment.” 

“To myself attend the unveiling, 
whilst you deal with the evildoers.” 
“To grasp the implication that I 
am to take whatever action seems 
appropriate to- deal with the inter- 



lopers?” Thilf inquired in this 
unctuous whisper. 

“To ask no foolish questions,” 
Shinth snapped. “The impossibility 
of permitting the lesser beings to 
survive to spread abroad reports 
prejudicial to the dignity of the 
Groacian state!” 

“To see eyeball to eyeball with 
your Excellency,” Thilf murmured. 

“That’s a bot of eyelalls,” 
Chauncey commented. “Well, 
Mr. Relief, it was a farrel of bun 
lyle it wasted but I kess it’s gur- 
tains now.” He twitched violently 
as an axe thunked into the door, 
causing it to jump in its frame. 
Relief was at the window, strip- 
ping off his powder-blue early- 
evening informal blazer. 

“Chauncey, how much stretch 
do you have left?” he asked over 
the battering at the door. 

“Hmmm, I gee what you’ve sot 
in mind. I’ll dee what I can sue — ” 
Chauncey unlimbered a length of 
tough cable from his left sleeve, 
sent it over the sill; his coverall 
hung more and more loosely as^ he 
paid out coil after coil of himself. 

“There’s thuch a sing as oving 
getter-extended,” he panted; by 
this time his garment hung limply 
on a single thumb-sized strand that 
extended from the water closet 
around the door jamb, across the 
room and down into the darkness 
below. 

“Can you handle my weight all 
right?” 

“Sure; in yast lear’s intermurals

I tested out at over talf a hon per 
air squinch.” 

“Tell me exactly where the other 
end of you is trapped.” 

Chauncey complied. As Retief 
threw a leg over the sill torches 
flared in the courtyard below. The 
Groaci Ambassador appeared, 
clad in full ceremonials, con- 
sisting of a ribbed cloak, pink and 
green argyles and a tricorner hat. 
Jeweled eye shields winked on each 
of his five stalked oculars. His 
four-Groaci honor guard trailed 
him through the gate and piled in- 
to the official limousine, which 
pulled away from the curb with a 
snarl of abused gyros. 

“Thell, Wat’s wat,” Chauncey 
said dejectedly, in-^a.tight- 
sjretched voice that emanated from 
the slight bulge that represented 
hit vital centers. “He’s on his say to 
the weremoney; in atither nun 
minutes it’ll be ove aller.” 

“So it will,’’ Retief agreed. 
“And we want to be there to see it, 
eh, Chauncey?” 

“Why? If there’s hateything I 
an, it’s a leerful chooser.” 

“1 don’t think there’s much dan- 
ger of your seeing one of those to- 
night,” Retief said; he gripped the 
warm, leathery rope of living flesh 
and started down. 



F ifteen feet above the 
cobbles the cable ended. Retief 
looked down, gauging the drop. 
At that moment the door below 



him opened and two tardy guards 
emerged at a trot, adjusting their 
accouterments on the run.* One 
happened to cock an eye upward, 
saw Retief, skidded to a halt, drop- 
ping his ceremonial pike with a 
clatter. The other uttered a hiss, 
swung his sharp-pointed spear 
around and upward. 

Retief dropped, sending the 
Groaci spinning. He rolled to his 
feet, sprinted for the corner of the 
courtyard where the drain 
emerged. Chauncey’s mournful 
blue eye gazed at him appre- 
hensively from atop the large bow- 
knot into which the extended stalk 
had been tied. Hastily, but with 
care, Retief set to work to untie it. 
Weak Groaci shouts sounded 
from behind him. More armed 
aliens emerged into the courtyard; 
more lights winked on, weak and 
yellowish in deference to the sensi- 
tive Groaci vision, but adequate to 
reveal the Terran crouched in the 
far corner. Retief looked around 
to see Captain Thilf charging 
down at the head of a flying wedge 
of pikemen. With a final tug he 
slipped the knot, saw Chauncey’s 
eye disappear back into the drain. 
He ducked a thrown spear, heard 
Thilf hiss an order. The Groaci 
guards ringed him in, their gleam- 
ing spearpoints bristling inches 
from his chest. The captain pushed 
through, stood in an arrogant pose 
before his captive. 

“So — the infamous wrecker and 
vile persecutor of peace-loving 



144 



IF 




arthropods is brought to bay at 
last, eh?” he whispered, signaling 
to a small, non-uniformed Groaci 
lugging a lensed black box. “To get 
a few shots of me shaking a finger 
under his proboscis,” he directed 
the photographer. “To preserve 
this moment* for posterity, before 
we impale him.” 

“A little to the right, your 
captaincy,” the civilian suggested. 
“To tell the Soft One to crouch a 
trifle, so I can get both of you in 
the same frame.” 

“Better still, to order it to lie on 
its back so the captain can put a 
foot on its chest,” a corporal 
offered. 

“To hand me a spear and to 
clear these enlisted men from the 
scene,” Thilf ordered. “To not 
confuse the clear-cut image of my 
triumph with extraneous ele- 
ments.” 

The guards obediently backed 
off a few paces; Thilf poked his 
borrowed pike at Retief’s chest. 

“To assume a placating pos- 
ture,” he ordered, prodding the 
prisoner lightly. Abruptly the cap- 
tain’s expression changed as a 
sinuous loop of tough-Jooking 
rope shot out of darkness and 
whipped around his slender neck. 
All five eyes shot erect, causing 
two of his semi-VIP zircon eye- 
shidds to fall with a tiny clatter. 
Retief snapped the spear from the 
stricken officer’s hands and 
reversed it. The encircling guards 
jumped forward, weapons poised; 



Thilf seemed to leap suddenly 
backward, to burst through their 
ranks and hurtle across the court- 
yard, heels dragging. Half his 
spearmen gaped after him as the 
other half closed in on Retief with 
raised pikes. 

“Drop those stig-pickers!” 
Chauncey’s voice sounded from the 
window above, “or I’ll hop your 
boss on his dread!” 

The Groaci whirled to see their 
captain dangling by one leg, twenty 
feet above the pavement. 

“To get a shot of this,” Retief 
suggested to the photographer, 
“to send home to his family. 
They’ll be pleased to see him hang- 
ing around in such distinguished 
company.” 

“Help!” Thilf keened. “To do 
something, culling-season rejects, 
or to be pegged out in the pleasure 
pits.!”. 

“To be in the chicken noodle 
whatever we do,” a sergeant mut- 
tered, waving the pikewielders 
back. 

“Mr. Retief,” Chauncey called. 
“Shall I nop him on his drob» or 
bust jash his brocks out on the 
rain?” 

“I propose a compromise. 
Captain,” Retief called. “Instruct 
your lads to escort us out of here 
and Chauncey will leave your in- 
ternal arrangements intact.” 

“To never yield — ” Thilf 
started — and uttered a thin shriek 
as the Squalian allowed him to fall 
a yard, or two, caught him in mid-

air and hoisted him up once more. 

“But on the other hand, to what 
end to die in the moment of vic- 
tory?” the captain inquired rea- 
sonably, if shakily. “To be noth- 
ing the meatfaced one can do now 
to half the unveiling.” 

“To stick this Terry and take the 
consequences,” a corporal sug- 
gested furtively to the sergeant. 
“To suffer the loss of the captain 
philosophically.” 

A flash-bulb winked. “To not 
worry,” the cameraman said 
blandly. “To distribute a few 
prints here and there if His Cap- 
taincy tries to throw his weight 
around.” 

The sergeant signaled; the 
Groaci formed up in .two ranks, 
spears grounded. He motioned 
Ret ief through. 

“To leave by the side exit,” he 
said. “And to not hurry back.” 
“Better hand me your side arm,” 
Retief suggested. The NCO 
complied silently. Retief backed 
to the gate. 

“See you outside, Chauncey,” 
he called. “And hurry it up— we’re 
on a tight schedule.”

(40 HOE would have lean the 
•^sook on his face when I deft 
him [angling from a fedge lifty feet 
up,” Chauncey was saying 
exuberantly as he gunned the car 
along the wet night street of the 
Squalian capital. “The dubby 



dirtle-crossers were baiting weside 
the drain for me to lawl out in their 
craps; fut I booled ’em; I shook a 
tort-cut through the teptic sank 
and out-ranked the flascals.” 

“A neat manuver,” Retief con- 
gratulated his ally as the latter 
wrenched the vehicle around a 
corner with a deafening hiss of 
steering jets. Just ahead, a clump 
of Terran officials stood under the 
marquee of the Terran Embassy. 
The car slid to a halt behind the 
gleaming black Embassy limou- 
sine. Magnan leaped forward as 
Retief stepped out. 

“Disaster!” he moaned. 
“Ambassador Grossblunder got 
back half an hour ago; he was 
furious when 1 told him about the 
Groaci unveiling their project at 
midnight — so he ordered our 
Grand Opening moved up to 1 1:59 
tonight! He’ll be down in a mo- 
ment in full formal regalia, with all 
media in attendance, on his way to 
upstage Shinth. When those 
drapes are drawn back to reveal 
nothing but a yawning pit — ” 
Magnan broke off at a stir behind 
him. 

The imposing figure of the 
Terrestrial Ambassador appeared, 
flanked by a covey of bureau- 
crats. Magnan uttered a stifled wail 
and scuttled to attend his chief. 
Retief stepped to the limousine 
chauffer’s window. 

“Drive straight to the Groaci 
project site, Humphrey,” he 
ordered. “Make it snappy.”

“Mate a winute,“ the Squalian 
demurred. “Master Mignan 
distoldly stink me to drive to the 
Serry tight—” 

“Change in plan.” 

“Well — ohsay if you kay so,” 
the driver grunted. “Wish some- 
body’d mind up their makes.” 

As the limousine pulled away, 
Retief jumped back into the staff 
car. 

“Follow them, Chauncey,” he 
said. “By the way, with that 
versatile sound-effects apparatus 
of yours, how are you at imper- 
sonations?” 

“Nitty prifty. Chief, if I sue day 
so myself. Thet giss: it's a 
Baffolian bog-fellow crying for his 
mate — ” 

“Later, Chauncey. Can you do 
Ambassador Grossblunder?” 

“Just between the tee of us, me 
and the boys have a lillion maffs 
taping the old boy’s owns.” 

“Let’s hear you do Shinth.” 
“Lessee: To joil in your own 
booses, tile Verry . How's 
that?” 

“It’ll have to do, Chauncey,” 
Retief said. “Now, here’s what I 
want you to do ... ” 

this?” Ambassa- 
TT dor Grossblunder was 
rumbling as Retief joined the 
Terran delegation alighting be- 
fore the bunting-draped, flood-lit 
entry to the tarpaulin-covered 
structure looming against the dark 
Squalian sky. “This doesn’t look 



like — ” he broke off as Ambas- 
sador Shinth appeared from 
among a crowd of retainers and 
local notables. 

“Good lord,” Magnan gasped, 
noting for the first time where the 
limousine had delivered them. 
“Your Excellency — there's been a 
mistake—” 

“Ah, so delighted to see you, 
Mr. Ambassador," the Groaci 
Chief of Mission murmurred. 
“Good of your Excellency to honor 
the occasion with your august 
presence. I’m delighted to see you 
hold no narrow-minded grudge, 
merely because I’ve bested you in 
our friendly little competition.” 

“Hah!" the bulky Terran 
snorted. “Your effrontery will 
backfire when the Prime Minister 
and Cabinet are offered nothing 
but a set of badly cured founda- 
tions, after all this empty fanfare.” 

“/Iw contraire, Mr. Ambas-' 
sador,” Shinth replied coolly. “The 
edifice is complete, even to the 
pennants atop the decorative 
minarets, a glowing tribute to 
Groaci ingenuity which will for- 
ever establish in the minds of our 
hosts an unforgettable image of 
the largesse-bestowing powers of 
thetjroacian State.” 

“Nonsense, Shinth. A confiden- 
tial source has kept me well 
abreast of your progress; as of 
yesterday, your so-called project 
hadn’t gotten off the ground.” 

“I assure you the deficiency has 
been rectified. And now we’d best

be nipping along to the reviewing 
stand; the moment of truth ap- 
proaches.” 

”Magnan,” Grossblunder said 
behind his hand. ”Did he say pen- 
nants atop the minarets? I thought 
that was one of the unique details 
of our project.’’ 

‘*Why, what a coincidence,” 
Magnan quavered. 

“Ah, there, Fenwick,” a deep 
purple Squalian in heavily 
brocaded robes loomed out of the 
drizzle before the Terran Ambas- 
sador. The local’s already im- 
posing bulk was enhanced by the 
ropes of pearls and golden chains 
intertwined with his somatic ele- 
ments, producing an effect like an 
immense plate of multi-colored 
lasagna. “I hardly exceeded to 
speck you here. An inspaying 
displire of inter-aiming specity !” 

Grossblunder harrumphed, 
clasping the proffered bundle of 
Prime Ministerial tissues in a 
parody of a handshake. “Yes, 
well, as to that — ” 

“You’ll poin my jarty, of 
course?” the Squalian Chief Execu- 
tive urged cordially, turning away. 
“Pee you on the sodium.” 

Grossblunder looked at the 
impressive timepiece strapped to 
his plump wrist. “Hmmph!’’ he 
muttered to Magnan. “We may as 
well. It’s too late now for me to 
stage my unveiling ahead of 
Shinth, a grave disappointment, 
regarding which I’ll have words 
with you later.” 



“Retief,’' Magnan hissed as they 
accompanied the group toward 
the brightly lit platform. “If we 
slip away now we may be able to 
sign on as oilers on that tramp 
freighter I saw at the port this 
afternoon. It looked unsavory 
enough for its skipper to be willing 
to dispense with technicalities — ” 
“Don’t do anything hasty, Mr. 
Magnan,” Retief advised. “Just 
play it by ear — and be ready to 
pick up any dropped cues.” 

On the platform, Retief took a 
position at Ambassador Shinth’s 
bony elbow. The Groaci gave a 
startled twitch when he saw him. 

“Captain Thilf didn’t want me to 
miss anything,” Retief said. “He 
decided to let me go after all.” 
“You dare to show your face 
here, after assaulting my — ” 
“Kidnappers?” Retief suggested. 
“I thought under the circum- 
stances perhaps we could agree to 
forget the whole incident, Mr. 
Ambassador.” 

“Hmm. Perhaps it would be as 
well. I suppose my role might be 
subject to misinterpretation — ” 
Shinth turned away as the orches- 
tra, composed of two dozen Squal- 
ians doubling as brass and strings, 
struck up a rousing medley of 
ctassic Elvis Presley themes. As 
the music ended a spotlight 
speared out, highlighting the slend- 
er figure of the Groaci Ambassa- 
dor. 

“Mr. Prime Minister,” he be- 
gan, his breathy voice rasping in 



148 



IF 




the PA system. “It gives me great 
pleasure — ” 

R ETIEF made an unobtrusive 
signal; an inconspicuous 
strand of pale purple that had glid- 
ed snake-like across the platform 
slithered up behind Shinth, and un- 
seen by any but Retief, deftly 
whipped around the Groaci’s 
spindly neck, quite invisible un- 
der the elaborate fuffs sported by 
the diplomat. 

A soft croak issued from the 
speakers spaced around the plaza. 
Then the voice resumed. 

“It grates me pleazh givver, as I 
was saying, to tray pibute to my 
escolled teamleague, Amblunder 
Grossbaster, by ungaling the Ver- 
ran tift to the palion Squeeple.” 
The Groaci’s spindly arm, assisted 
by a tough length of Chauncey, 
reached out and yanked the trip- 
line holding the tarps in' place. 

“What in the world did he say?’’ 
Grossblunder growled. “I had the 
distinct impression he called me 
something unprintable — ” He 
interrupted himself as the can- 
vas tumbled away from the struc- 
ture to reveal the baroque pile 
dazzling under the lights, pen- 
nants awave from the minarets. 

“Why — that’s my Bolshoi-type 
ballet theater!” Grossblunder 
blurted. 

“And a glendid spift it is, too, 
Fenwick,” the Prime Minister 
exclaimed, seizing his hand. “But 
I’m a fit conbused — I was inder 



the umpression this decereful 
little lightemony was arranged by 
Amshisiter Balth— ” 

“Merely a bit of artful misdi- 
rection to keep your Excellency in 
suspense, ha-ha,” Magnan im- 
provished hastily. 

“You mean — this strendid spluc- 
ture is a sift from the GDT?” the 
PM expressed confusion by 
writhing his features dizzyingly. 
“But I had a direct stinkollection 
of ceding the site to the Groaci 
Mission — ” 

“Magnan,” Grossblunder hissed 
“What’s going on here?” 

As Magnan stuttered, Retief 
stepped forward, offering a 
bulky pairchment, elaborately 
sealed and red-taped. Grossblun- 
der tore it open and stared at the 
Gothic lettering. 

“Magnan, you rascal! You 
staged all this mummery just to 
add an element of suspense to the 
proceedings, eh?” 

“Whom — I — your Excellerl^?” 
Magnan croaked. 

“Don’t be bashful, my boy.” 
Grossblunder poked a meaty fin- 
ger into Magnan’s ribs. “I’m de- 
lighted! About time someone en- 
livened the proceedings.” His eye 
fell on Shinth, whose body was 
twitching in a curious rhythm, 
while his eye stalks waved in no 
discernible pattern. “Even my 
Groaci colleague seems caught up 
in the spirit of the moment,” he 
boomed heartily. “Well, in re- 
sponse I suppose we can hardly 



PIAAE DOESN'T CRAY 



149 




fail to reciprocate in the same 
spirit. I suggest we all troupe off 
now to witness the presentation 
of the Groaci project, eh?” 

“Laybe mater,” a faint voice 
croaked. “Night row I got to boe 
to the gathroom.” Shinth turned 
stiffly and tottered away amid 
shouts, flashbulbs, bursting sky- 
rockets, and a stirring rendition 
of the Dead March from Saul. 

. “Retief,” Magnan gasped as the 
Ambassador and the PM moved 
off, chatting cordially. “What? 
How—” 

“It was a little too late to steal 
the building back,” Retief said. 

“1 did the next best thing and stole 
the deed to the property.” 

(4¥ STILL feel we’re skating on 

iver^ thin ice,” Magnan said, 
lifting a plain ginger ale from the 
tray proffered by a passing 
waiter. He cast a worried eye 
across the crowded lounge toward 
ArfTbassador Grossblunder. “If 
he ever finds out how close we 
came to having to write a Report 
of Survey on one Ballet The- 
ater — and that you violated the 
Groaci Embassy and stole offi- ' 
cial documents — and that one of 
our drivers laid the equivalent of 
hands on the person of Shinth 
himself—” he broke off as the 
slight figure of the Groaci Am- 
bassador appeared at the entry 
beside them, his finery in a state 
of disarray, his eyes canted at an 
outraged angle. 



“Good lord,” Magnan gasped. 
“I wonder if it’s too late to catch 
that freighter?” 

“Thievery,” Shinth hissed, 
catching sight of Retief. “As- 
sault! Mayhem! Treachery!” 

“I’ll drink to that,” a portly dip- 
lomat said blurrily, raising his 
glass. 

“Ah, there, Shinth,” Gross- 
blunder boomed, advancing 
through the press like an ice- 
breaker entering Cartwright 
Bay. “Delighted you decided to 
drop by — ” 

“Save your unction,” the Groaci 
hissed. “I am here to call to your 
attention the actions of that 
one.” he pointed a trembling digit 
at Retief. Grossblunder frowned 
at the latter. 

“Yes — you’re the fellow who 
carries my briefcase,” he started. 
“What—” 

There was a sudden soft thump, 
merged with a metallic clatter, 
Grossblunder looked down. On 
the polished floor between his feet 
and those of the Groaci were 
spread several hundred chrome- 
plated paper clips. 

“Oh, did you drop something, 
your Excellency?” Magnan 
chirped. 

“So!” Grossblunder bellowed, 
his face purpling to a shade which 
aroused a murmur of admiring 
comment from the Squalian bear- 
ers gathering to observe the by- 
play. 

“Why, however did those paper 



150 



IF 




clips get into my pocket?” Shinth 
wondered aloud, but without con- 
viction. 

“Ha!” Grossblunder roared. 
“So that’s what you were after, 
eh? I should have known — ” 

“Bah!” Shinth responded with a 
show of spirit. “What matter a 
few modest souvenirs in the fight 
of the depradations of — ” 

“Few? You call sixty-seven gross 
a few?” 

Shinth looked startled. “How 
did you — that is to say, I absolute- 
ly deny — ” 

“Save your denials, Shinth!” 
Grossblunder drowned the Groaci 
out. “I intend to prosecute — ” 

“I came here to speak of grand 
larceny,” Shinth cut in, attempt- 
ing to regain the iniative. 
“Breaking and entering! Assault 
and battery!” 

“Decided to make a clean breast 
of it, eh?” Grossblunder boomed. 
“That will be in your favor at the 
trial.” 

“Sir,” Magnan whispered ur- 
gently. “In view of Ambassador 
Shinth’s magnanimous blunder — I 
mean gesture — earlier in the even- 
ing, don’t you think it might be 
possible to overlook this undeni- 
able evidence of red-handed theft? 
We could charge the paper clips 
up to representational expenses, 
along with the liquor.” 

“It was his doing!” Shinth point- 
ed past Magnan at Retief. 

“You must be confused,” 
Grossblunder said in surprise. 



“That’s just the fellow who car- 
ries my briefcase. Magnan is the 
officer in charge of the investiga- 
tion. His harassment got to you, 
eh, Shinth? Conscience found you 
out at last. Well, as Magnan sug- 
gests, I suppose I could be lenient 
just this once. But that’s one you 
owe me — ” Grossblunder clapped 
the Groaci on his narrow back, 
urging him toward the nearest 
punchbowl. 

“Heavens,” Magnan breathed to 
Retief. “What a stroke of luck! 
But I’m astonished Shinth could 
have been so incautious as to 
bring his loot along to the recep- 
tion.” 

“He didn’t,” Retief said. “I 
planted it on him.” 

“Retief— you didn’t — ” 

“Afraid so, Mr. Magnan.” 

“But — in that case, the paper 
clip thefts are still unsolved — and 
his Groacian Excellency is being 
unjustly blamed.” 

“Not exactly; I found the sixty- 
seven gross stashed in his office, 
concealed under a flower box full 
of jelly-blossoms.” 

“Good lord — ” Magnan took 
out a scented tissue and mopped at 
his temples. “Imagine having to 
lie, cheat and steal, just to do a lit- 
tle good in the world. There are 
times when I think the diplomatic 
life is almost too much for me.” 
“Funny thing,” Retief said, eas- 
ing a Bacchus brandy from a pass- 
ing tray. “There are times when to 
me it seems hardly enough.” •

Always know your enemy — but 
know yourself even better! 



STERLING E. LANIER 

I 

T he great blue sun was a long 
way from the planet called af- 
ter it, Origen VII. As he ran 
heavily over the hot sand under its 
glare, William Powers, Field Agent 
of Survey and Contact Bureau, 
Syrian Combine, thanked the One 
God that its heat was no worse. It 
barely approximated 105® F on 
Terra. Even so, only Powers’ 



153 




superb condition enabled him still 
to keep moving at the steady trot 
he was forcing himself to main- 
tain. 

Beside him the lean, seven-foot 
form of his Lyran partner sped on 
with no visible effort, flexible tail 
streaming behind him, slender 
five-clawed toes making only a 
faint rustle in the black sand of the 
canyon’s floor, a noise imper- 
ceptible to anyone but the man 
running beside him. Powers could 
barely hear the thud of his heart 
but he had no trouble with the 
crunch of his feet as the plastic 
sandals bit into the ground and 
occasional patches, of naked rock 
over which the two ran. Sweat 
poured from his nearly naked 
body. It was kept from his eyes by 
a crude headband, hastily made of 
cloth torn from the coat of his van- 
ished uniform. Other than this, 
sandals and his calf-length service 
pants, he wore nothing at all. 

In the waste all wasjstill save for 
the two running figures. Above 
them, on both sides, the towering 
walls of the mighty gorge rose 
sheer and stark, black and red rock 
making a pattern of ferocious 
beauty. Except for ah occasional 
gray cactus — like shrub clinging 
to the rock or rooted in some 
crevice, no vegetation was visible. 
Down the almost straight hun- 
dred-foot width of the canyon floor 
the two ran, as if competing in 
some strange contest. 

In another quarter of a mile 



Powers stole a glance at his 
wristchron. 

“Break,” he croaked and came 
to an abrupt stop. 

The Lyran checked at once and 
whirled in one easy motion to look 
back up the canyon, his long tail 
curling gracefully as he did so. 
Seeing nothing, he turned his 
great red goggle eyes on his human 
companion, his immobile, snouted 
face looking like nothing as much 
as a magnified head of a Terran 
chameleon. But there was both 
intelligence and concern in the 
huge, lambent orbs as he saw how 
Powers panted while he crouched 
on one knee. 

“Bill,” he said in Universal, 
making it sound more like Hipeei 
“you don’t look so good. Can you 
last much longer?” 

“Why in hell, you overgrown 
skink, you don’t get out of here, is 
beyond me,” gasped Powers. 
“How much water you got left?” 

The Lyran examined the skin 
water bag slung over one bony 
shoulder. 

“Maybe a quart. Maybe a 
touch more. Want some?” 

“Yeah,” said the man, holding 
up one hand for the water. He 
drank rapid gulps of the muddy, 
lukewarm fluid and handed the 
skin back in silence. The olive- 
scaled Lyran stood above him, lean 
double-ankled legs locked as he 
braced himself on his long stiff- 
ened tail, the whole forming a rigid 
triangle on which to rest. In this 



154 



IF 




portion he also shaded Powers 
from the sun but neither one men- 
tioned it, any more than he did the 
fact that only Powers had used the 
water. 

S AHK MAZZECHAZZ was a 
native of Beta Lyrae IV or 
Zzorm, an ancient, arid planet, a 
world not unlike the Karoo desert 
of Southern Africa over much of its 
expanse. He needed little water at 
any time and the hot blue glare of 
giant Origen bothered him hardly 
at all. It was the man who was in 
really bad trouble and they both 
knew it. There was no need to 
make any comment. The help was 
an automatic reflex and on a dif- 
ferent, perhaps wetter, world, 
would have been as freely given in 
reverse. 

Powers’ breath had subsided to 
normal and he checked his chron 
again. 

“Let’s go,” he said, coming to 
his feet. “I’ve had five minutes and 
we haven’t got time to hang 
around. We don’t know what those 
hellions turned loose after us. We 
only have the one chance and we 
need cover.” 

“Quiet a moment, please,” said 
the Lyran. He was now standing 
fully erect and his broad, pl^te-like 
tympanum surfaces, far more 
sensitive than human ears to 
vibration, were quivering as he 
strained to catch a sound. Powers 
waited, also staring up canyon. He 
could sec and hear nothing. The 



shimmering haze, caused by heat 
reflected off the rocks arid sand, 
made visibility almost nil more 
than two hundred yards away. 

“Yes,” said Mazzechazz after a 
moment. “Something comes, 
something large and with many 
limbs, my friend. We had best 
resume our journey. We can do 
nothing here.” 

The two began to run down 
canyon again, their eyes ceaseless- 
ly scanning the terrain ahead and 
on either side. They needed an am- 
bush spot, anything at all that 
would give them a chance against 
whatever horror had been loosed 
on their trail. A chance to use their 
one weapon. 

As he ran Powers cursed the 
grim humor of the Arghor war 
chiefs to himself, not for the first 
time. They had carefully deprived 
the two agents of all their weapons, 
even down to knives, leaving them 
only a food pack, water and a 
limited amount of clothing. Two 
items of Powers’ personal jewelry 
had been overlooked or con- 
sidered unimportant. One was his 
wristchron, the other the large 
Space Academy ring he wore, set 
with a green stone. Next, the 
Arghor had left them at the head of 
the great gorge and told them to 
run. 

“One comes perhaps, whom it 
would not be well to meet,” the 
oldest chief had growled jovially 
and all the surrounding warriors 
had yelped in what passed for de- 



NEVER CRY HUMAN 



155 




lighted laughter, some even 
slapping their black-furred thighs 
in a fair approximation of mirth. 

For the tenth time since their 
capture at the end of the previous 
night, Powers had, with dignity, 
pointed out that he and the Lyran 
had the status of ambassadors and 
that the sky gods would curse any 
who harmed such. 

“We have harmed no one. Sky- 
dweller,” snarled the old chief 
venomously. “You came un- 
asked, out of nowhere, on behalf 
of other irreligious, muck-eating 
monsters like yourselves down on 
the plain yonder. Whom we will 
kill in due course. You claim to be 
heralds, ambassadors? We asked 
for none, nor were w£ asked by 
your people to receive any. We 
found you at night lurking on our 
land near your sky machine, doubt- 
less engaged in some vile sky- 
people plot. We could kill you at 
once without losing honor. This 
one with you looks like an evil 
spirit. 

“But you are heralds, you say? 
Perhaps. We will release you then. 
If you are true warriors you need 
no cowardly death beams,” and he 
pointed a massive, pelted hand at 
the two Ferraby handlasers lying 
on the ground. 

“Let us have our knives then. 
Eldest,” rejoined Powers, staring 
impassively into the angry yellow 
eyes. “If you leave us defenseless 
entirely, then who will be the 
coward?” 



“No!” roared the angry old 
chief. Standing so close to Powers 
that his sharp-snouted, hairy face 
was only inches away. “No — we 
give you a chance for life, no more. 
You deserve no more, like all the 
dirty leaf and root eaters in your 
tribe. If you are true people, true 
hunters, make the most of it and 
save yourselves. Otherwise, die 
here and now.” 

“We are ready,” interrupted the 
Lyran. He had been standing, 
arms folded, not speaking, while 
Powers argued. Now he took 
Powers by the arm and gently 
pulled him back. 

The Unitrans machine which 
had taught them both to speak the 
Arghor dialect could not help to 
make the barks, growls and grunts 
as fluent for the reptilian mouth 
of the Lyran, but the tribemen 
nevertheless fell silent when he 
spoke. Humans they were used to 
seeing, but Mazzechazz was un-. 
canny, and the fact that he could 
speak to them in their own tongue 
made them even more nervous. 
They were not afraid, exactly, but 
there was a grudging respect in 
their attitute toward the towering 
lizard shape that was absent in 
their attitude toward Powers. 

“Go then,” grunted the old chief, 
“You have been given food and a 
skin of water. If you escape from 
the Hunter of the Sands we will kill 
you later — but in fair fight. Now 
go.” 

Powers turned and followed his 



156 



IF 




partner down the crude vine ladder 
to the canyon floor far below. At 
the bottom he looked up, expect- 
ing to see the assembled tribe gaz- 
ing down, prick-eared in the clear 
light of the coming dawn. But the 
ladder was hauled up by invisible 
hands and then there was nothing. 
The Arghors had vanished, 
apparently uninterested. 

“I think we had better run, 
friend,” said Mazzechazz gently, 
taking the unspoken thought 
from his mind. “They surely would 
like to see us die — and that means 
they are probably extremely 
scared of what’s coming. They are 
not hanging around to see how 
we’ll make out.” 



N OW, three hours later, they 
had been running, running and 
running, thought Powers. And still 
they had found no position for 
making a stand. The level bottom 
of the canyon had stayed smooth, 
large, flat rocks alternating with 
fine gravel and sand, but with no 
break or usable crevice in the 
towering walls. The gentle down- 
ward slope never varied or ceased. 
Only the timed rests and his iron 
will had kept Powers from 
collapsing, but Sakh Mazzechazz 
could still go a long way. Powers 
knew that the big Lyran ought to 
have left him but he had given up 
arguing. The other had made it 
plain that he was not going to 
desert his partner for any reason 



whatsoever, mission or no mis- 
sion. 

As he pounded grimly and un- 
deviatingly along. Powers tried to 
keep his mind off his straining 
muscles and laboring breath by re- 
casting the events of the past few 
cycles in his mind. Everything had 
happened quickly— too quickly. 

While returning from a pirate 
scan near the outer Magellanies 
he and his teammate, Mazzechazz, 
had been beeped by a subdimen- 
sional probe, matching velocities 
with their two-man, deep-space 
Farover. The powered message 
capsule, actually a tiny ship keyed 
to a molecular frequency in their

been taken aboard, stored for re- 
turn to base, its coded contents 
read. 

The message had come through 
the subspace dimension from 
H.Q. on Sirius Prime. It seemed 
that no Word had been received for 
three weeks. Universal time, from 
a new human colony on a Terra- 
type world called Origen VII. 

The colony was one of the pro- 
ducts of an influential religious 
body, the Methodist Revival 
Templars, a group originating on 
old Terra in the distant past, still 
with Terran headquarters, but 
powerful on other worlds also. 
The Templars were ancient 
Christian in their remote 
antecedents and gave their clergy a 
lot of authority. A strongly 
pacific — even pacifist— sect, they

had a previous record of planting 
useful and healthy colonies on a 
number of worlds suitable for 
agriculture. They did not despise 
scientific technology but favored 
the simple life. 

Although the colony was human, 
the- native inhabitants of Origen 
VII were not, although they were 
classified as clearly mammalian. 
Pictures and data on the planet, its 
ecology, resources and all other 
pertinent matters were included 
in the message. The Templar 
colony had been supposed to re- 
port twice a (Universal) week, but 
via sub-space radio, not capsule. 
Mission for Powers and Mazze- 
chazz: Go find out what was wrong 
and either report or -take appro- 
priate action. Coordinates were 
given. That was all. 

T he silent colony on Origen 
VII proved easy enough to lo- 
cate. Set in a valley at the base of 
a mountainous and rugged penin- 
sula on the larger of the two north- 
ern continent^, it could be picked 
up easily on a clear night by its 
blaze of light. No natural satellite 
circled the planet to give light and 
the glow of the settlement was .very 
plain. Farover landed easily, flick- 
ering out of the black sky into a 
glare of flood lights at the edge of 
wiiat quickly revealed itself as a 
brand-new, defensive perimeter. 

Heavily armed men, their faces 
haggard with strain, had swarmed 
around the ship as soon as it 



touched down. On emergence, the 
two Survey agents were caught up 
in a babbling crowd of excited 
people, all talking at once and 
were rushed almost off their feet 
to the office of the colony’s gover- 
nor, who was also its chief priest. 
Behind them as they went. Powers 
noticed guards digging still more 
trenches and laying wire around 
the S. and C. ship, enclosing it in 
the zone of defense. 

When all others but the six mem- 
bers of the governor’s council had 
been excluded and a guard had 
been posted outside, the two 
agents were finally able to ask 
questions. At least, so they 
thought. 

Governor Halk Tahira, 4^resby- 
ter of the Faith, was a man of late 
middle age and, if Powers were 
any judge, late middling experience 
and intelligence as well. He had 
been ready to explode for days and 
waited no longer. 

“Do you know what’s been going 
on here?” he had shouted rhetori- 
cally. “This place was cleared, pro- 
nounced safe by all official 
sources. Safe and harmless! The 
natives were listed as ‘primitive, 
s.emi-nomadic indigenes, mam- 
malian type, humanoid in struc- 
ture and intelligence and friendly 
to outside contacts!’ Friendly! 
Humanoid! That’s what the of- 
ficial report said. “Do you know 
what we call this place? Wolf 
World!” 

He had raved on. And since 



158 



IF 




Powers and Mazzechazz were 
learning something from his at- 
titude they made no move to inter- 
rupt. Finally he ran down, more 
from lack of wind than emotion 
and the real questions started. Al- 
lowing for hysteria and shock, 
what had been allowed to happen 
seemed bad enough, in all truth. 
Someone, and it looked like Sur- 
vey and Contact, which bore the 
responsibility for the first re- 
ports, had goofed, but good. 

The natives of Origen VII were 
semi-nomadic all right — carniv- 
ores at various levels of Stone Age 
culture, who ate nothing but meat 
unless literally starving. Canni- 
balism was usually a matter of 
ritual but perfectly acceptable if 
the meat were an enemy warrior 
of one’s one tribal group. The 
planet provided a variety of en- 
vironments, all of them swarming 
with large and small game. Most of 
the big game animals and their 
attendant predators were highly 
dangerous themselves. You 
worked for your dinner. 

At first friendly enough, the na- 
tives had swiftly become con- 
temptuous on discovering that 
the humans were omnivores 
whose basic diet was vegetable, 
who did not eat each other and 
failed to see hand-to-hand combat 
as the only hobby for an idle mo- 
ment. 

The natives were erect, bipedal 
and possessed five digits on what a 
zoologist would style manus and 



pes or hand and foot. Opposable 
thumbs were present. 

In general appearance and at a 
fast look the natives resembled 
nothing so much as human-sized, 
black dogs walking upright, al- 
though they wore harnesses of 
leather and made sophisticated 
bone and stone tools. They lived in 
palisaded villages, used fire and 
were quite as intelligent as any 
member race of the Syrian Com- 
bine. 

Their economy was strictly 
primitive, however, and since 
they actually occupied a very 
small share of the planet’s total 
surface, the Combine Xenolog- 
ical Bureau had given permission 
for a colony, subject to the usual 
safeguards. These, were designed 
to protect the natives, be it stated, 
and not the colony. 

The Grawm, as the race styled it- 
self, was anything but united. 
Primitives almost never are and 
the natives of Origen VII were no 
exception. 

T he particular body of Grawm 
who called themselves Ar- 
ghor, was a widespread con- 
federacy of ten tribes, numbering 
perhaps a bit less than ten thou- 
sand warriors. As part of their 
hunting grounds they owned the 
peninsula on which the human 
settlement had been placed. 
Sparked by anti-vegetarian dis- 
gust and apparently urged on by a 
powerful (and hitherto unsus- 



NEVER CRY HUMAN 



159 




pected) shamanic priesthood, they 
had attacked the colony in broad 
daylight a month earlier. De- 
spising humans and unaware of 
what advanced technology pos- 
sessed in the way of weapons, the 
Arghor warriors had relied on 
head-on charges. 

At tremendous cost to them- 
selves, the “Wolves” had pene- 
trated to the governor’s quarters, 
destroying the subspace radio 
shack en route and by mere 
chance. When they were finally 
driven out, ninety-two men, 
twenty-two women and eleven chil- 
dren were dead or missing. Mere- 
ly wounded in one degree or 
another were two hundred and ten 
more. An estimated, thousand 
Arghor, all fighting males, had 
been killed, mostly by close-range 
laser fire. 

Now the colony had been placed 
under a loose but effective siege. At 
first individual Arghor war- 
riors tried to kill Templar sentries 
at night, for both weapons and 
prestige. A jury-rigged radar net- 
work had quickly put a stop to this 
practice. It was now safe to move 
around the colony perimeter, but 
that was all. No hunting was pos- 
sible except by airboat and the 
boats had to land and retrieve any- 
thing killed at once. The seven 
existing airboats could hardly feed 
the eight hundred people who re- 
mained in any case, and the emer- 
gency food stocks were already 
half gohe. The speed-growth crops 



on which the colony had relied 
for the coming season were total- 
ly destroyed, the fields stamped flat 
by the enraged Arghor. All in all. 
Powers had reflected, a fairly fnes- 
sy situation. 

He was not unaware of the psy- 
chic damage either. Peaceful 
people, who hated violence, had 
been forced to kill and had seen 
loved ones killed as well. This was 
as much a tragedy as the purely 
physical aspects of what had 
happened. 

He had interrupted the fuming 
governor at this point in the story 
and inquired what that ecclesi- 
astic official thought ought to be 
done. 

“Ought to be done?” spluttered 
Presbyter Tahira angrily. Powers 
decided Tahira was a standard 
Mark I bureaucrat — overweight, 
confused and helpless in an emer- 
gency. 

“We should get a battleship. 
Marines, heavy lasers, clear this 
end of the peninsula,” the gover- 
nor had suggested, his voice rising. 
Other members of the council had 
joined in. “Paralysis beams — null 
rays — grabbers — rover bombs — ” 

The babble had slowly died away 
as it became apparent that Powers 
and Mazzechazz were simply sit- 
ting, saying nothing, waiting. Fi- 
nally the room was silent again. 

Reverend Presbyter,” 
Powers had said. “I’ll tell 
you what we're actually going to

do. You Templars, despite your 
religion and its training, all seem 
to have forgotten the Combine 
Charter. This is not your world, 
unless the intelligent inhabitants 
want you. This they no longer do. 
Whose fault your coming here was 
originally means nothing, under- 
stand me, nothing.” He had stared 
coldly at the council and no eyes 
had met his. The Lyran had waited 
quietly. This was human business. 

Powers then continued. ”My 
partner ^nd I will try to fix up this 
mess. Peaceably. You people can 
defend yourselves if attacked 
and that is absolutely all. I am as- 
suming military command of this 
post. Does anyone oppose my au- 
thority for so doing?” Again there 
was silence. No one had wished to 
go on record as opposing Survey 
and Contact Field Agents. The 
reputation of the Corps insured 
that. In addition, the reminder of 
their religion and its teachings was 
not making them deeply ashamed. 

Reinstalling the governor as 
commandant, but this time as his 
deputy. Powers had filed a sub- 
space report of the situation to 
Prime base from the ship’s radio. 
After ordering an emergency 
supply ship to leave at once and 
outlining his procedures and ideas 
as part of the report. Powers had 
not waited for an answer. The two 
S. and C. specialists had decided 
to head for the main Arghor en- 
campment that very night and 
start the ball rolling. He and Maz- 



zechazz had taken one of the col- 
ony’s airboats and landed on the 
rim of the plateau about a mile 
from the blaze of fires marking the 
main Arghor camp. 

Several canyons and gorges ran 
up from the end of the peninsula 
and the human settlement’s 
location to the top of the massif. 
The Arghor apparently were 
based in a whole series of camps, in 
the mountains and sent their war- 
riors down to attack the off- 
worlders in rotation. 

At any rate, with less than one 
more Universal period left of the 
local, or four-day, night. Powers 
and Mazzechazz decided to try a 
sneak survey of the main enemy 
position. They landed, seemingly 
undetected. Only the cry of some 
distant bird thing and the hum of 
insects had. broken the velvet dark- 
ness. 

As the airboat touched down 
gently on the grass of the plateau a 
local mammoth-sized herbivore 
had burst, trumpeting loudly, out 
of an adjacent clump of brush and 
trampled heavily on and over the 
rear or engine part of the machine 
before galloping ponderously in- 
to the surrounding gloom. In no 
more than five seconds, before 
they had even left the airboat, the 
two agents had been robbed of 
ninety percent their mobility. 

Badly shaken around and bat- 
tered though they were, yet no real 
bodily injury had occurred. 
Feeling more or less safe, both

from the distance to the enemy 
camp and the presence of the 
hulking brute which had smashed 
their aircraft, Powers and the 
Lyran had started to examine the 
damage to the little vessel. They 
later agreed that one of them 
should have manned the combat 
radar, but by the time the hide 
lassos had dropped neatly out of 
the black night and over their 
shoulders it had been a bit late to 
worry about it. 

Caught by an alert Arghor 
hunting party, which had chanced 
to be downwind of their landing, 
Terran and Lyran had been drag- 
ged before the hastily summoned 
Assembly of Chiefs, stripped and 
sentenced, all in one operation. 
As dawn came up they had gone 
down into the canyon. 

II 

T he two runners rounded a 
sharp bend in the gorge — and 
both abruptly halted, looking at 
each other as the topography 
sank in. This was the first sharp 
corner they had found since 
starting. 

“Do you think we can do bet- 
ter?” hissed Mazzechazz. “We 
have perhaps five minutes before 
it comes.” 

“This looks quite possible,” said 
Powers absently. In front of him 
were two hugh, steep-sided rocks, 
giant boulders over twenty feet 
high, which almost blocked the 



whole canyon. The last flash flood 
must have failed to move them far- 
ther down the canyon floor. A nar- 
row gap between the rocks — only 
about six feet wide — constituted 
the sole pathway to whatever lay 
beyond. 

Walking through this opening 
and pacing it. Powers estimated its 
depth at about ten feet and the dis- 
tance to the corner they had just 
rounded at double that. 

“This is okay,” he said. “We can 
relax, I think, unless what’s 
coming is a lot tougher than it has 
any right to be. Should be quite 
killable on a Terranorm planet 
though.” 

“It comes now,” said the Lyran 
and proceeded to crouch low at 
the downcanyon base of one of the 
great stones, the one to the right. 
His tail was coiled neatly about his 
ankles and his great eyes were cov- 
ered by his long-fingered hands. 

The man stepped out into the 
middle of the gap and waited. He 
finished very carefully removing 
the large stone, an oval green Cad- 
mean fire eye, from the ring on his 
right third finger. As he looked 
upcanyon he hefted the stone in 
his right hand, keeping his thumb 
and index finger pressed on it. He 
could hear the rustling himself 
now — it was rapidly becoming 
louder and louder. 

Powers poised for action. 

Around the corner of the cliff ap- 
peared two immense whiplike an- 
tenna, a sickly blue in color. They 



162 



IF 




were followed by a great, flat head 
surmounted by two monstrous 
pupilless eyes, also blue. From 
mighty mandibles at the front of 
the head drooled a foul-scented 
ichor as the creature paused to ex- 
amine the puny-looking prey, 
which seemed to await it with such 
confidence. Six great, jointed 
legs, tipped with spiked claws, and 
then an armored, ten-foot body 
slowly followed the. awful head 
around the corner. Powers and 
the beast were now no more than 
fifteen feet apart. 

“Down!” shouted the Terran 
and hurled the three-quarter inch 
stone square, flat and low, at the 
nightmare head. Even as he re- 
leased the tiny trigger pressed 
down underneath the stone, he was 
diving to the left for the shelter of 
the other great rock. He fell 
prone — face ground into the 
sand — behind it as the tiny 
Osmium wrecker bomb went into 
its nuclear cycle, exactly on tar- 
get. The huge boulder actually 
shifted in its bed next to him and a 
blast of superheated air came 
over its top and around the sides. 
Powers, his eyes tightly shut, hug- 
ged the sand as the terrific heat of 
the almost soundless explosion 
eddied around his body and the 
sand swirled over his naked back 
and shoulders. His eardrums 
ached from the pressure of the 
blast. 

“Get up. Bill,” said Mazze* 
chazz. “It worked.” 



P OWERS scrambled to his feet, 
somewhat embarrassed by the 
fact that he had not yet realized it 
was safe to do so. He found the 
big Lyran standing in the gap be- 
tween the two mammoth stones. 
The sand on which his clawed feet 
rested was now covered by a thin 
film of fused, black glass, a mute 
tribute to the tiny bomb’s intense 
heat. 

The two looked back up canyon 
but except for a scorched area,, 
fifty feet across, where sand and 
rock had flowed together, there 
was nothing to be seen. 

“Superscorp seems to have 
bought it,” acknowledged Powers. 
There was not a speck of matter to 
show that the giant arthropod 
had ever existed, so savage had 
been the instant furnace created 
by the nuclear Osmium. 

“That’s the second time that ring 
has saved my life,” «aid Powers, 
turning away. “Give me a swal- 
low of the water and let’s go. If my 
bearings are right, we should make 
the base camp in three more hours, 
provided the Wolves don’t pick us 
off first.” 

“They probably have the camp 
ringed by scouts,” said Mazze- 
chazz, passing over the canteen. 
“We know how good they are. 
Why not signal, use smoke or 
something and call down one of 
the three big airboats they have 
left?” 

“The Arghor could reach us a lot 
quicker, I suspect.” 



NEVER CRY HUMAN 



163 




They both glanced up at the 
rims of the gorge, far above 
against the white sky, but no sign 
of life or movement could be seen 
there. Some winged creatures cir- 
cled higher still, probably the local 
analog of vultures. The oppressive 
heat of Origen, the great, blue sun, 
still lay all around them. 

The man drank some lukewarm 
water and considered, while the 
Lyran waited. Of the two, Mazze- 
chazz was the profounder thinker, 
the philosopher-logician, the 
chess player. He was also the 
memory bank, a living library of 
history and technology, spanning 
many races and worlds besides his 
own. But in a situation calling for 
lightning action, reflex moves and 
brutal cunning Homo sapiens had 
still not met a peer in the galaxy. 
Powers was the decision maker 
here by mutual consent. Just as he 
had cold-bloodedly risked anni- 
hilation for years by wearing a 
long-outlawed nuke ringstone, so 
he now ran the combat situation 
on a moment-to-moment basis. 

In this case his decision stayed 
fixed. “We have a better chance 
trying it on foot,” he decided 
aloud. “They won’t be expecting 
us and I’m pretty sure the whole 
tribe back at the main camp thinks 
we’re dead. We got caught good 
when the airboat was stomped — 
but I’m damned if I think any 
primitive can beat us at scouting 
when we really work at it.” 

Without another word they set 



off down the canyon again. They 
now possessed no weapon at all, 
save for their wits, but the pros- 
pect of meeting another ravening 
life form daunted neither of them. 
They were trained to do all they 
could and not worry about what 
could not be helped. Worrying, as 
opposed to forethought, clouded 
the mind. A clouded mind could 
mean bad reaction time and that 
got you killed. So, at a trot calcu- 
lated to save energy, the two agents 
loped along, looking for the next 
obstacle. 

T en Universal hours later Pow- 
ers was as tired as he had ever 
been in his sometimes very active 
life. He and his partner were un- 
comfortably ensconced in a giant 
tree, about a half-mile from the 
fortified outer zone of the Temp- 
lar settlement. To all appearances, 
as far as their getting to home 
base safely went, they might as 
well have been on the other side of 
the planet. 

They had emerged earlier from 
the mouth of the canyon to find 
themselves in more or less dense 
forest, although moving in the 
right direction for ultimate 
safety. Realizing that they prob- 
ably stood a good chance of being 
slaughtered on the ground by 
native predators, if not by the Ar- 
ghor, they had taken to the tower- 
ing trees and moved more or less 
easily along through them toward 
the base. Their alien order prob- 



164 



IF 




ably helped keep what animals 
they saw at a distance. 

But now, out of water and 
hungry, they seemed stuck and 
could see no way to go farther. Ar- 
ghor sentries, easily spotted from 
high above, were spread all around 
the section of base perimeter the 
two could observe. The offworld 
agents had managed to count nine 
of them, in a layer three deep, 
crouched in immobile watchful- 
ness. The warriors were not too 
close to one another laterally; 
that is, each file of three formed a 
rather isolated line extending out 
from the base to the forest’s edge, 
each of the enemy being about 
one hundred and fifty feet apart. 
With the wolf people’s keen scent 
and hearing the formation ap- 
peared an effective one. It was 
hard to see how man and Lyran 
could get by without detection. 

“Suppose we went between two 
of the files?” said Powers in a 
whisper. 

“Then both sets would hear or ^ 
smell us,” said Mazzechazz. “But 
I have an idea. These are very 
proud, independent creatures, 
William. They dislike calling for 
help unless desperate. Many 
savages act so. Now suppose we 
come down, you in front and 
then—” 

Powers’ answering whisper grew 
excited. 

An hour later they were hailing 
the Templar sentries manning 
the perimeter. And ten minutes 



after that they were relaxing in 
air-conditioned privacy on their 
own ship. 

“I’m amazed that anything that 
obvious worked,” mumbled 
Powers as he chewed away at the 
second large steak he had cooked. 
Across the dining table, Mazze- 
chazz was eating spiced, processed 
fruit. His people had never been 
carnivores, or at least not since a 
stage analogous to a shrew in hu- 
man evolution. 

He finished a portion of some- 
thing purple and juicy and flicked 
a handful of seeds out of his 
mouth with his slender tongue be- 
fore answering. 

“Psychology, William, psychol- 
ogy. Action is not everything. 
What could be simpler? You walk 
up to a sentry, naked, unarmed 
and hands in the air. By the way, 
there is food for thought in this 
area of defenselessne&s. I must 
consider it, 

“To resume, can he kill you? No, 
you are helpless, he has* to talk, 
figure things out, try to under- 
stand why you are out there 
coming from the wrong direction. 
This is too much of a puzzle. In 
the half-minute it takes to think of 
asking for advice, not help, mind 
you, advice, I, the quieter moving 
of the two, have eased up behind 
him and throttled him into insen- 
sibility. The sentries in the files to 
left and right have heard nothing 
and the two remaining in his own 
line but nearer to camp have not

been called. He gets tied up, I take 
his knife for insurance and we re- 
peat the performance twice more, 
all the way into camp. Psy- 
chology!” He selected a package 
of Terran figs and carefully 
opened it, transparent nictitating 
membranes snapping over his 
eyes in anticipation. For a while 
the two ate in silence. 

At last, his belt groaning. Pow- 
ers leaned back and reached for a 
pipe. 

“So now what? We managed to 
get out safe and sound, but that’s 
all. Got any ideas? 

“It seems to me,” he went on, 
without waiting for the other to 
speak, “that we have to recom- 
mend evacuation. The Atghor are 
intelligent, quite highly intelligent, 
even if they’ve only arrived at the 
Neolithic. They now detest hu- 
mans and want to kill them all. 
It’s their planet and they have the 
right to do so if the humans re- 
main. The humans, under Syrian 
Combine law, do not have the right 
to kill the Arghor, even in self de- 
fense, once they^ the humans that 
is, have been officially told to 
leave and the Combine has evalu- 
ated the situation and agreed. 
Which would seem to make evac- 
uation the only possibility. Some- 
one is going to get a very noisy 
kick in the pants over this,” he 
added. “I mean the S. and C. team 
that recommended this hell hole 
for colonization. And that’s our 
service responsibility. The whole 



of Survey and Contact is going to 
look awfully incompetent when 
this news gets out. Even the Bu- 
reau can’t keep this one quiet. 
There are too many people and 
departments involved, Xenologi- 
cal. Colonization — all those, et- 
cetra.” He subsided, stoking his 
pipe with black Cannicotea an- 
tarea, lighting it and emitting 
clouds of lavender smoke. 

T he Lyran ran his tongue 
around his wide, lipless mouth, 
pushed the empty food containers 
away and leaned back in his ham- 
mock, supple tail curling neatly 
around the stanchion which sup- 
ported one end of it. 

“Don’t be so gloomy, William,” 
he said gently. “We have only 
been here a little over one cycle. 
Besides, if my ideas are correct, 
there should be no real trouble 
about this colony. A little thought 
is what is needed, a little philo- 
sophy, a little history, and a little 
psychology. Something work- 
able exists in our common store of 
experience for every eventuality. 
We have only to tap the proper 
circuit.” 

“Have you got something to use 
all that quickly?” said Powers. 
“Short of driving the Arghor out 
of an area and erecting a large 
force field, I can’t think of any- 
thing.” 

“There are several possibil- 
ities,” said the Lyran. “They are 
perhaps eighty percent carniv- 



166 



IF 




orous^ or even more, from the re- 
corded data. We could quite easily 
remove most of the game ani- 
mals from any given area, perhaps 
drive the animals out with con- 
tact sonics. The Arghor would 
also have to move or starve.” 

“That’s interference with a na- 
tive intelligent life form. Destroy- 
ing or moving their food supply is 
hardly noninterference, is it?” 

“All right,” rejoined Mazze- 
chazz. “But it’s not lethal and sure- 
ly allowable.” 

“Not, and I stress this point,” 
said Powers smugly, “unless the 
people or civilization or culture 
or what have you constitute a 
menace to the peace of the civil- 
ized universum. From “consti- 
tute” on, that’s a quote from our 
own manual, which you know 
better than I do.” He leaned back 
and .exhaled more of the pungent 
smoke. Since Lyrans have no 
powers of scent worth' mentioning, 
Mazzechazz *had never noticed 
the aroma of Powers’ pipe, which 
made many other beings as well as 
humans ill. 

“Mmm, quite so, William. But I 
never really intended this pro- 
posal seriously: I simply wished to 
indicate that there are any num- 
ber of solutions to any given prob- 
lem and that we should be ex- 
ploring them and not trying to 
evade our duty. We need to reason 
matters through, not simply re- 
port that matters are hopeless,” 

Powers tried to look thoughtful. 



All that came to his mind was a de- 
sire to rest, which was not very 
helpful. The Lyran, however, 
had a modest share of the strange 
telepathic talent of his race. 

“Go lie down,” he said. “I don’t 
feel tired. When you wake up I’ll 
give you a dozen solutions, all 
good. Then you can explain why 
none of them will work. Yet one of 
them will be correct. The clue I 
will leave you to dream over is this: 
the answer lies in ancient Terra, 
in your own past.” 

T he following day, local time*, 
was busy indeed. Once per- 
suaded that the weird proposal 
made by Mazzechazz was quite 
legitimate and even practical. Pow- 
ers had to sell it to the governor 
and council of the Templars. He 
knew that if these men, particular- 
ly the Presbyter-governor, could 
be convinced, the rest of the col- 
ony would follow. The debate was 
long. 

“Presbyter, I am not a merriber 
of your splendid religion,” he said, 
trying a new argument, “but isn’t 
there a saying ‘Oh, Ye of little 
faith — ’ in your holy book?” 

“Yes, there is,” said Tahira 



* Four Universal 28-hour (Terran) peri- 
ods equal one Origen VII day or night. In 
the human colony Universal Time based 
on this cycle was maintained artificially, 
since the days and nights were simply too 
long for human activities. The Grawm 
were largely diurnal but not entirely so.

sourly. “However, you are of- 
fering an explanation based on 
science not religion. And if you 
are wrong we will all perish miser- 
ably, women and children as 
well.” 

“All the Research and Biolog- 
ical authorities we have mes- 
saged on Prime Base bear my part- 
ner out,” countered Powers. 
“They also say that if the plan is 
not tried the only alternative is to 
recommend immediate evacu- 
ation. The colony will be com- 
pletely written off and the planet 
will become an educatable ward 
of the Syrian Combine. Perhaps 
it will be opened to colonization 
again, by some more reasonable, 
adaptable group.” Alw^iys save 
the sting for the tail, the psych 
books said. 

“further,” he continued, “your 
remark about all perishing is sil- 
ly. There is some danger to a few 
of us — those out in front — 1 agree. 
I will be out there in front, you 
know, with whoever volunteers 
from your colony. The extra- 
polation based on BuPsych 
readings says about twenty men 
should be enough. No women or 
kids need be involved at all.” 

“Suppose they use missile wea- 
pons, spears maybe, from a dis- 
tance?” said a younger council 
member; one of the smarter ones. 
Powers recalled. 

“They’ll be barred from doing 
so for two' reasons,” said Powers. 
“One, we’ll be away out in a part of 



your fields near no cover when they 
spot us. Two, they kill hand-to- 
hand from preference. We’ll be 
isolated, almost naked and 
empty-handed when they first see 
us working. The results will sur- 
prise you, I guarantee. 

“Look,” he went on, “Sakh and 
I dug up one of the dead Arghor 
you buried and dissected him right 
down to his capillaries. These are 
pure and simple pack carnivores, 
only a lot more intelligent than 
the four-footed variety you and I 
are used to. In fact, let’s face it, in 
lots of ways> as intelligent as you 
or I. No species precisely like 
them has been encountered up to 
this point, but they obviously had 
to appear at some point just be- 
cause of the law of averages. And 
as Sakh points out, they’re a pic- 
ture-book example of what had 
been predicted they would be like 
if they ever did appear. “They live 
in tribes, which are little more 
than extended families or clans, 
rather like Terran primitives. 

“The Amerindians of old Nor- 
america,” said a hitherto silent 
councilor. 

“Exactly,” said Powers, glad of 
any support, however vague and 
qualified. “To go on, they possess 
a high degree of what used to be 
called chivalry. They never harm 
the females, the aged and the 
young in their battles with each 
other. War is a sport for healthy 
males only. Again, there are nu- 
merous Terran parallels.”

IF 




44 AGENT POWERS, assum- 
that what you have said 
earlier is correct, this last obvious- 
ly is totally wrong,’^ sneered the 
Presbyter. “They killed every child 
and woman they could reach in the 
battle. A number are just plain 
missing and you have admitted 
that they were probably carried off 
to be eaten. Is this an example of 
your so-called chivalry?” 

Patiently Powers returned to the 
scientific explanation he had pre- 
sented earlier in the day. 

“There again are two points to 
take note of. Presbyter, One, what 
were women and children doing 
during the attack? Two, what is 
the Arghor view of human beings, 
inculcated by both your food 
habits and by the arguments of 
their priests, wizards or whatever 
you want to call them? 

“Don’t answer,” he went on. “I 
know what happened and so do 
you. When attacked by hairy, 
savage monsters the women and 
kids fought. Who wouldn’t?” I 
agree entirely. But if they had 
known more, if they had been 
trained, they would not have fought 
at all. All they had to do was what 
I’ve told you. “Sakh and I took an 
Arghor prisoner some twelve stan- 
dard hours ago and we went 
through his mind up, down and 
sideways. We knoy^^ the Arghor, I 
tell you, and Sakh’s idea is pure 
genius — which is nothing more 
than intuition, memory and scien- 
tific knowledge all coalesced. You 



have to try this or go home with 
your tails between your legs, 
beaten by a bunch of primitives 
and savages.” 

The Templar councilors stared 
at one another for a few seconds 
without speaking. Powers leaned 
back in his chair, projecting a 
good imitation of casualness and 
tried not to look at the silent Ly- 
ran across the table. He, in turn, 
had no trouble appearing calm. A 
reptilian face seldom displays 
emotion in any way a human can 
read. 

Powers was aware that his last 
shot had been fired. And he had 
managed to conceal a major 
source of his concern from the 
council — the fact that Shrvey and 
Contact would get a public black 
eye if the colony were forced to 
leave. This was something to avoid 
at all costs. Now he could do noth- 
ing but wait. But in truth, the de- 
cision had already been made. The 
Presbyter-governor broke the si- 
lence. 

“It means only risking twenty 
men, I suppose, and we have lost 
many more. We need eighteen vol- 
unteers, gentlemen.” 

“You mean twenty, don’t you, 
Reverend, sir?” said a council 
member. 

“Agent Powers and I make 
two,” said the governor drily. He 
met Powers’ eyes squarely for the 
first time and even managed the 
ghost of a smile. 

Powers said, “I’m honored.”

The details were easily settled. 
The long local night was coming to 
an end. The idea would be tested 
at dawn by Powers and the others. 
Mazzechazz would remain in 
command of the perimeter, most 
of which would be unguarded. 
Save for the party of exposed 
men who had volunteered; there 
should be no real danger to the 
rest of the humans on the planet. 
And in last analysis, the Farover 
possessed enough armament to 
stand off with ease anything the 
whole Arghor confederacy 
could summon up. But it was not 
supposed to come to that. There 
was going to be no violence at all. 
Powers told himself silently as 
the meeting broke up-:-=.not the 
slightest bit of violence. 

Ill 

P RETENDING to hoe a 
chewed-up, rock-strewn piece 
of what had once been a Templar 
grain field in the pitch dark just be- 
fore dawn. Powers was not quite 
so sure. 

He and Governor Tahira, plus 
eighteen other nervous men had 
shipped out in the colony’s air- 
boats a half-hour earlier. They had 
been dumped, almost naked and 
armed only with wooden sticks, in 
the middle of what had been the 
Templar’s ttgricultural area, 
over a mile from the nearest 
woods. They were all pretending 
to hoe. 



Powers concentrated on mental 
calisthenics and recited twelve 
Vegan verse palindromes back- 
ward, chopping savagely at the 
ground as he did so. He could hear 
nothing and see very little but he 
felt sure that he and the others had 
been accurately pinpointed by 
the Wolves. 

Quit calling them that, he 
thought. You re getting to believe 
Mazzechazz too much and too 
hard . , 

And where was that reptilian 
conman? Why, back on the ship, 
since he would be useless in this 
human problem and would merely 
confuse the issue for the Arghor 
minds. 

Artificially preoccupied with 
such reflections. Powers was taken 
by surprise by the coming of the 
dawn. Almost without warning 
visibility became unlimited. As 
the rim of the giant sun poked 
above the horizon he lowered his 
gaze and squinted. Unconscious- 
ly, he and the other men began to 
draw slowly together, their eyes 
shuttling to the dark forest. 

“There they come — ” A young 
settler, pale but determined, 
stopped pretending to hoe and 
pointed. Shading his eyes. Powers 
saw the line of black dots break out 
of the forest and move rapidly to- 
ward them. 

“Remember,” he shouted, “they 
can kill us in seconds if you don’t 
obey orders and do what you’ve 
been taught. Have faith!”

IF 




“As a priest myself, Agent, in a 
case like this, perhaps I should be 
above fear.” Presbyter Tahira 
had moved close to Powers and' 
spoken in a low tone of voice but 
his eyes twinkled and he seemed 
quite calm. 

The Arghor were now only a 
hundred yards away, and sudden- 
ly the blazing dawn’s quiet was 
shattered by a concerted howl. 

The warrior nearest to Powers 
was now charging, heavy, stone- 
tipped spear drawn back in one 
hairy arm. Others who had out- 
stripped their fellows were about 
to fall upon Tahira and his eight- 
een Templars. 

“Now!” shouted Powers. 

I NSTANTLY everyone, includ- 
ing Powers himself, dropped to 
the ground. The men lay flat on 
their backs, knees drawn up to pro- 
tect their stomachs, backs arched 
and arms extended at full length 
on the ground. All bent their heads 
back, so that their straining throats 
were exposed to the sky above. In 
this posture, eyes wide open, they 
waited for the enemy. 

By rolling his eyes. Powers could 
see the six-foot, black-furred war- 
rior who had been about to skewer 
him stop a few yards away, dumb- 
founded, fanged jaws agape. Un- 
moving, Powers watched the 
Arghor approach, spear drooping, 
until he stood over Powers’ body, 
his rank odor a pungent remind- 
er of alienness. 



“What is this skyfolk madness?” 
the Arghor growled. “Get up and 
fight, die like a warrior, skyman?” 

Powers remained frozen in his 
strange posture. The Arghor raised 
his spear as if to strike and sud- 
denly shrieked horribly. Some- 
how Powers managed not to 
flinch. The Arghor stopped 
screaming. Staring at Powers, he 
yelped with frystration, shaking 
his hairy head from side to side and 
doing a little dance of sheer rage. 

“Get up and die,” he howled 
again, dancing in a circle. Powers 
could hear a similar and deafening 
chorus all around him. It was 
music to his numbed ears. He al- 
lowed himself a small smile. His 
neck muscles ached from the up- 
ward jut of his throat and chin but 
he could hold the cramped posture 
a long time if he had to do so. So, 
he was sure, could the others. Now 
that they realized it was actually 
working, they could hold it all 
day, spurred on by success. 

His own screaming Arghor sud- 
denly stood squarely over his 
body, furry legs straddling Pow- 
ers. Growling horribly and word- 
lessly, the savage fumbled with 
his leather breechclout. 

By God, Sakh even predicted 
this . 

Powers then closed his eyes 
tightly. The ultimate insult and 
also the ultimate award for suc- 
cess. The prize for cunning was 
hardly pleasant but it was a far 
cry from death or defeat. He

waited, honest laughter explod- 
ing deep in his body, but outward- 
ly as rigid as ever, for the final and 
irrevocable gesture of contempt. 



A S THE Farover bored through 
‘‘its first subspace jump on its 
return trip to Sirius Prime the two 
agents relaxed, each in his own 
way. The ship was on automatic 
and its computer could take care 
of almost any emergency imagin- 
able. 

Stripped of his harness, Sakh 
Mazzechazz was going over his 
body inch by inch with a tiny bat- 
tery-operated buffer, polishing 
his minute scales until his whole 
yellowish green body gleamed 
and shimmered in the light. 

“You must have a date,” said 
Powers. 

Equally relaxed, he had been 
transcribing notes for his own pri- 
vate records. Now he put down his 
recorder and turned his gaze on 
the Lyran. 

“I said, you must have a date. 
Am I right?” 

“A young female from my dele- 
gation’s staff on Prime Base has 
brought me messages from the 
nearer members of my clan. It is 
only natural that I hear them in 
the proper atmosphere of privacy. 
Otherwise proper reverence would 
not be displayed.” 

“Yes,” agreed Powers. “You 
mean you have a date.” 

“That’s right,” said the Lyran. 



His red goggle eyes met Powers’ 
and the transparent membrane 
flickered up and down rapidly in 
an uproarious laugh. 

Powers smiled. “You deserve a 
date,” he said quietly. “As a mat- 
ter of fact, you deserve a medal. 
Not that you’ll ever get one, pal. 
Mind telling me the background 
of your wizardry back there on 
Wolf World? You said the clues 
that gave you the idea were from 
my own racial history, 1 know, 
but we had no time to go into it in 
any detail.” 

“A small matter, Williams, 
hardly worth discussion. It will 
be in the report and you can read 
it later back at H.Q.” 

“Ah, ah,” said Powers. “Play 
fair. Lizard face, I know how mod- 
est you pretend to be but this time 
don’t bother. I want a story. Let 
the backroom boys read it at H.Q. 
You just tell Daddy in simple 
language.” 

The Lyran’s gular pouch sudden- 
ly swelled out into a great, bluish 
fan under the long, thin jaws. The 
sight was a frightening one to 
someone unaccustomed to his 
race. The gesture meant abso- 
lutely nothing, as a matter of 
fact, being purely vestigial and 
used perhaps as a yawn or stretch 
in a human. 

“Very well,” said Mazzechazz, 
“since you are so insistent. But it 
hardly bears telling. When the 
human governor, the priest Ta- 
hira, spoke of the Arghor as 



172 



IF 




‘wolves,’ something clicked in my 
mind. Somewhere, long ago, I had 
seen a reference, perhaps far back 
in time, as a young student. It was 
to the Terran carnivorous ani- 
mals called by this name. The ref- 
erence, too, must have lain in some 
sphere of my own interest, which, 
as you know, mainly comprises 
alien psychology and things re- 
lated to it. 

“The Lyran mind, organized as 
it is, must reject useless infor- 
mation and store usable data 
only. This reference then must lie 
in the latter category. I therefore 
put myself in a trance state while 
you listened to the history and the 
hysterics of the governor and his 
council, and isolated the ref- 
erence, as well as several related 
to it — and others still more re- 
mote but bearing on the general 
subject. The matter of recall un- 
der such conditions requires 
training, of course. But it was not 
so hard as the time I — “ 

“Never mind past triumphs,” 
growled Powers. “Stick to Wolf 
World.” 

“If you insist, Softskin. Your 
own education may even be 
raised an infinitesimal notch. Un- 
liklier things have happened.” He 
neatly ducked a seat cushion and 
went on talking. “Long, long ago 
on Terra, before your first Global 
Interregnum, the science of be- 
havioral psychology, which even ! 
must admit, you excel in, was still 
in its infancy. Certain of your 



early scientists, led by a man 
named Lorenz, postulated that 
rules of behavior which rigidly 
governed the lower animals also 
might affect human beings. The 
fact that Lorenz and the others 
had barely begun even to discov-. 
er the basic rules which governed 
the lower animals made their 
work very difficult. 

“But they persevered. One of 
them, whose name 1 never 
memorized, having no reason to, 
was working with Canis lUpus, the 
wolf, the ancestor of all the dogs 
and doglike things you humans 
carry about with you to this day as 
pets and guardians. This person 
discovered that a pack-living 
carnivore such as the wolf is the 
most rule-bound, other-struc- 
tured animal in creation. It has to 
be. If it were not, the race it 
represents would perish. The rules 
are simple but unbreakable and 
they go as follows: 

1) Females and young of its race 
may not be attacked unless the 
young are approaching maturity. 
Then the adult pack leaders may 
expel them. 

2) Territories are inviolate and 
may not be entered without 
elaborate ceremonial and ritual 
between packs. 

3) Any members of the same 
species, that is, a wolf which ex- 
poses its vital organs, such as the 
throat and belly, and refuses to 
fight may not be harmed. 

“The last rule is perhaps the 



NEVER CRY HUMAN 



173 




strongest of all. Note, William, 
that these rules are common sense 
for a carnivorous animal. Omni- 
vores and herbivores, such as you 
and I, can kill our own species 
with ease. In the case of my plan- 
et, a world government came 
mercifully early, you know the 
unhappy and bloody history of 
your own before the Syrian Com- 
bine discovered Terra and com- 
pelled you to seek membership. 

“But a true carnivore can only 
kill on a very small scale. Any male 
Grawm would have to have a civil- 
ization a billion Standard revolu- 
tions old to overcome the inbred 
inhibitions against total war upon 
his own species. Fighting other 
males for sexual reasons, small- 
scale raids for prestige. Tor sport 
really, all these things, yes. But 
killing the young, the .aged, the fe- 
males and above all those who will 
not fight back, never! He can’t do 
it. The pack leader can kill any 
pack member. This is because he is 
the strongest and the wisest, the 
most cunning in battle. Those be- 
low him do not fight back when he 
punishes. It would be interesting to 
know what happens to old leaders! 
I think I can guess, however. 

“Once I had recalled all; this I 
examined, nientally and physical- 
ly, a Grawm male. It then became 
a simple matter to set up a con- 
struct and a field problem. And of 
course it worked, because my 
examination proved my theoreti- 
cal postulate to be more than ap- 



proximate. It was more exact than 
I could believe.” 

“Irritating though it is to' agree 
with you. I’m afraid you’re right,” 
said Powers. 

“You were so right,” he went on, 
“that when that hairy buck stand- 
ing over me relieved himself I al- 
most wanted to yell, ‘Not me, 
Mazzechazz did it!’ You told me 
that this was a probable gesture 
of utter contempt among such a 
species and it certainly was.” 

“The extrapolation for such an 
action was only sixty-five percent, 
allowing for the differences in in- 
telligence and culture between 
Grawm as a higher species, and 
wolves,” said the Lyran. “I was 
lucky.” 

“I wasn’t.” Powers grinned. 
“But even that kind of bath wasn’t 
much of a price, I agree, not for 
what we got. Once they realized 
that the twenty males they had 
pinned down wouldn’t move, 
wouldn’t fight, they sent for the big 
chiefs. It took xjuite a while but 
there was no real problem.*! sim- 
ply made it plain that we were non- 
fighters. That all the fighters had 
been killed in the big raid and that 
we would never send any more. 
That we were cowering behind 
the colony walls trying to think of 
a way to tell them this. 

“They were almost physically 
ill when I finished. In a genera- 
tion, maybe, the Propaganda 
boys can start a little work of an 
underhand kind and begin to

IF 




civilize them. Meanwhile, they 
want no part of any human. 

“Now,” he went on, stretching 
lazily, “we can forget about the 
Arghor Confederacy — or any 
Grawm as a problem. Every 
colonist will be taught as an infant 
to flop on his or her back, throat 
exposed, the minute a male 
Grawm appears. I strongly sus- 
pect that all the Arghor villages 
will change location to miles 
away from the settlement — and 
very quickly at that. The sense of 
disgust, the sheer revulsion, at 
being located near a colony of 
non-fighting males must be hide- 
ously strong. 

“I am incapable of truly appre- 
ciating — or should I say feeling 
mammalian emotion, as you 
know,” said Mazzechazz. “I 
would not have risked this opera- 
tion without your approval de- 
spite all my theory.” 

“The minute you suggested it 1 
knew it would work,” said Pow- 
ers. “These Arghor aren’t so very 
far from my own ancestors in a lot 
of ways. The main problem, of 
course, the real risk, was a rather 
subtle one. Did the Grawm 
species, specifically the Arghor, 
despite their hatred and contempt 
for us, feel we were their spiritual 
equals? If they didn’t, if they saw us 
a weird but lower form of animal, 
then all bets were off. Things could 
have been different. The wolf in- 
hibition against killing only ap- 
plies to one’s own kind, not to rab- 



bits or deer. That was the only real 
chance we had to take. Your 
figures said it was an extremely 
good chance, so I took it and per- 
suaded the others to take it as 
well.” 

“Actually,” the Lyran began, 
“actually you took no chance at 
all.” He appeared in some impos- 
sible way, embarrassed at what 
he was saying. Finally, after 
looking at a bulkhead, he stared 
his partner in the eye, using ono of 
his own periscope orbs, head 
turned sideways. 

“I had a needle-beam laser on 
electronic reflex aimed at your 
particular assailant, William. 
Had he moved one wrong muscle 
and I know to a millimeter which 
they are — the telltales, I mean — he 
would have died at once. So would 
the others.” 

Powers was horrified. “My god, 
that would have violated the major 
Prime Directive! Are you crazy? 
How would you have explained it 
later?” 

The Lyran’s membranes flick- 
ered up and down over the great 
red eyes. 

“Oh,” he said. “I would have 
thought of something. I am too 
lazy and too conservative to be- 
come accustomed to a new part- 
ner, you see. It has nothing, of 
course, to do with sentiment.” 

Powers looked hard at the Lyran 
and then himself glanced away at 
a sealed port. 

“Yes,” he said. “1 see.” •

Science had deprived 
him of death . 




LEE HARDING 



T he house had been empty for 
several days. The skeleton staff 
had been dismissed well in ad- 
vance of his arrival and all incom- 
ing business calls had been trans- 
ferred elsewhere to be handled by 
underlings. Darius Wynter did 
not wish to be disturbed. 

His private retreat was so artful- 
ly concealed that it seemed from a 
distance to form part of the rocky 
headland jutting out of the lugu- 
brious northern coastline. A soli- 
tary window in his study over- 
looked the gray and restless sea. 



The glass had been treated to 
eliminate glare and to prevent re- 
flected sunlight from advertising 
his location. 

He sat at his desk with his back 
to the window, a distinguished- 
looking man accustomed to sup- 
porting his considerable share 
of his time’s problems upon his 
broad shoulders. Serenity was a 
familiar companion to him but 
from time to time deep shadows of 
doubt crossed his mind. His gray 
eyes were locked into some inner 
vision. 



176 





He sat motionless for some time, 
conscious of the mournful sound 
of the distant surf raging against 
the jagged rocks at the foot of the 
headland, while his practiced in- 
tellect inspected the facets of his 
problem. Eventually he reached a 
decision. He reached into an open 
drawer on his right, withdrew a 
number of documents and placed 
them carefully in front of him. He 
hesitated. Then his hand, guided 
by familiar reflexes, groped deep- 
er into the drawer and emerged 
with an ornate handgun. 

The workmanship of the wea- 
pon was remarkable. It was one 
of the last remaining examples of 
late twentieth century craftsman- 
ship in the realm of portable 
lasers. The intricate hand-tool- 
ing had always delighted the con- 
noisseur in Darius Wynter. Guns 
fascinated him and his collection 
of antique hand weapons was per- 
haps the finest in the known uni- 
verse. This particular item was his 
favorite. 

He handled it fondly. His long 
white fingers traced the tactile 
sensuousness of the intricate pat- 
terns of filigree and brought a 
smile of satisfaction to his weary 
face. His right hand closed affec- 
tionately around the polished jade 
butt and his finger curled over the 
firing button. 

The weapon seemed to come to 
life under his touch. A warmth 
spread through his fingers that 
was like shaking hands with a 



friend. Yet he knew that this was 
an illusion, that the warmth, the 
contentment, came from within 
himself and were transferred into 
the beautiful instrument of death. 

He smiled again. The gun felt 
comfortable in his hand, as 
though it had grown there in 
answer to some need. He lowered 
his hand until his knuckles 
touched the cold top of the desk. 
His mind toyed idly with possi- 
bilities. With the beam adjusted to 
“fine” the gun, when fired, would 
incinerate an area roughly two 
feet in circumference — large 
enough to burn a man’s head into 
ashes and remove him from all 
worldly cares — and quickly 
enough for him never to know 
what had happened. 

His fingers moved, playing with 
the corrugated adjustment dial 
on the bridge of the weapon. His 
eyes had acquired a cool, dispas- 
sionate air. He shifted his grip so 
that the narrow muzzle faced him 
and his thumb was poised over the 
small white firing button. 

A ghost of a smile clung to his 
bloodless lips. There was always 
time for one last thought — behind 
him he could hear the patient 
surge of the restless ocean and felt 
a brief moment of pity for its 
senseless striving. 

His left index finger flipped over 
the safety catch on the ornate 
handgun. 

He looked indifferently into the 
small black eye of death.

And pressed the firing button. 



OTHING happened. 

But time reeled to a stop. Be- 
fore the last gram of pressure had 
been applied to the shiny white 
button under his thumb his hand 
froze. A sudden stasis grabbed at 
his body and made it rigid. His 
blind eyes stared wildly ahead at 
nothing in particular. Only his 
thoughts remained active and they 
tumbled around in his head in no 
reasonable order; for the time be- 
ing he had lost the ability to think 
sequentially. 

A moment later his Follower 
materialized in front of him. 

The Follower was a young man 
dressed in powder-blue coveralls 
who had the flat, unimaginative 
features of a public servant. He 
stepped casually from the travel 
portal and moved over to the desk. 
Behind him the glowing golden 
nimbus of the portal dimmed but 
remained in position, ready to 
transport this servant of the rich 
back to his observation post once 
this small crisis had been ironed 
out. 

Around his waist was a wide 
steel belt studded with an array of 
switches. He carried a small 
black box, which he deposited on 
the carpet in the center of the 
room. Then he walked over, leaned 
across the desk and carefully 
pried the handgun out of Darius 
Wynter’s hand. He relocked the 



safety catch and placed the wea- 
pon to one side with a bored, indif- 
ferent expression. 

He stood back and undipped a 
small, cylindrical instrument 
from his waist and waved it slowly 
around the room. He consulted a 
small dial fixed to one end and nod- 
ded, satisfied. He kneeled and 
pressed several switches on the 
small black box on the floor. A 
faint vibration shook the room 
and blurred the outlines of the fur- 
niture and two men inside it — the 
effect lasted for several seconds 
before the room returned to nor- 
mal. 

Darius Wynter blinked. His 
lungs relaxed and expelled the air 
they had held since his seizure. His 
eyes focused first on his empty 
hands and then on his visitor. 

“Oh,” he said. “So it’s you.” 

He had failed again. 

Giving the impression of a man 
suddenly too weary, he leaned 
forward and buried his face in his 
hands. The tips of his fingers dug 
into his forehead and then worked 
slowly down his cheeks. 

“Fm sorry,” he said. “I didn’t 
mean — ” 

“That’s all right,” the young 
man said quickly. He was required 
to appear solicitous, but his con- 
ditioned and supposedly cheery 
smile had a facile look. “We’ve 
been watching you for days.” 

Wynter looked genuinely sur- 
prised. “So long?” 

The young man tapped the end

IF 




of the cylindrical instrument in 
his gloved left hand. “You’ve been 
giving off quite a high potential 
for some time. We knew you’d try 
something eventually.” 

“But I had no idea — ” 

“Until a few moments ago, when 
you picked up the gun?” 

Darius nodded. 

The young man’s smug expres- 
sion became suddenly grave. “I 
think it only fair to caution you 
that I’m still.getting a rather high 
probability indication.” He 
raised his instrument significant- 
ly. “Of course it sometimes takes 
time for these things to die down. 
Personally, I would advise you 
to try and grab hold of yourself as 
quickly as possible.” 

Darius Wynter managed a con- 
vincing shudder. With some ef- 
fort he pulled himself together. 
“If you don’t mind,” he said, ris- 
ing from his desk, “I’ll pour my- 
self a drink.” 

“Go ahead, Mr. Wynter. You 
probably need one.” 

Dapius waved open his wall 
cabinet and poured himself a good 
strong whisky with surprisingly 
steady hands. He turned around. 
“Could I offer you something?” 
The young man shook his head. 
“Sorry, Mr. Wynter, but you see 
we have rules against — ” 

“Yes — yes of course. I under- 
stand. How stupid of me.” He 
brought the elegant crystal de- 
canter back with him and set it 
down on the wide desk. His eyes 



skipped quickly past the beautiful 
little handgun the Follower had 
left there. He managed to look 
both guilty and embarrassed at 
the same time. 

“You’ve had a go at this before, 
haven’t you?” the young man ob- 
served. 

D arius shrugged, “if you’ve 
been watching me for as long 
as you say you have you’ll have 
familiarized yourself with my 
file.” 

“That I have, sir. You’ve made 
seven previous attempts to take 
your life, most of them rather 
clumsy and well telegraphed. I’m 
glad to say.” 

“Yes,” Darius agreed, a trifle 
wistfully, ‘Hhere was always a 
Follower handy.” 

“Well, that’s what you pay your 
premiums for, isn’t it?” The young 
man made no effort to conceal his 
contempt. 

Darius declined to comment. 
Instead he resumed his seat in the 
well-upholstered desk chair and 
looked thoughtfully around the 
room. 

“I had no idea this room was 
bugged.” 

The young man smiled smugly. 
“I suppose you thought that your 
insurers wouldn’t have heard 
about this place, that you would be 
able to sneak away up here with- 
out anybody’s knowing? But what 
use is a comprehensive cover- 
age if you can cheat like that? 



THE IMMORTAL 



179 




Trudential is, Mr. Wynter, the 
most experienced insurer in the 
business: we never leave any- 
thing to chance.- We’re thorough, 
Mr. Wynter, and that’s why we 
have the best record in the busi- 
ness.” He moved his portable me- 
ter around while he spoke; he was 
still getting a faint threshold sig- 
nal and this made him wary. 

His careless arrograhce annoyed 
Darius. “How old are you?” 

“Twenty-seven,” the Follower 
replied guardedly. “Why do you 
ask?” 

Darius shrugged and sipped his 
drink. “The impetuousness of 
youth interests me. Do you like 
your job?” 

The young man made, a vague 
sort of gesture which might be tak- 
en to mean yes. 

“I see. Well. 1 suppose you 
would have to, wouldn’t you? And 
I suppose you’re chasing a little 
slice of immortality along with the 
rest of us?”. 

The word was a joke. Rejuvena- 
tion was a costly and unpredict- 
able business, difficult to disci- 
pline. Some recipients had barely 
managed to scrape through anoth- 
er hundred years, while others had 
endured the entire span of two and 
a quarter centuries since the intro- 
duction of the anti-agathics. Ev- 
erything depended on the individual 
metabolism and how it reacted to 
the drugs. The techniques im- 
proved every year and the ultimate 
goal was a golden, predictable 



longevity for every person in the 
known universe — according to his 
means. 

And there lay the rub. Some- 
times, when his lonely mind was 
wrapped in cynicism, Darius 
found it amusing that, in this age 
of material abundance, the ac- 
cumulation of worthless baubles 
and artifacts had given way to a 
universal scratching for another 
few years of life and, as always, 
the prize went to the richest. 

The young man didn’t answer, 
but this didn’t worry Darius— his 
words had been an observation, 
not a direct question. He saw a 
flicker of greed appear self-con- 
sciously in the Follower’s cold 
blue eyes, but it was soon erased 
by a look of professional aloof- 
ness. 

“How long have you been a Fol- 
lower?” Darius asked. 

“This is my first year.” But he 
answered off-handedly. His eyes 
were intent upon his meter and he 
seemed disturbed. He looked up. 
“Mr. Wynter, 1 must mention 
again that I am still getting a 
rather high probability index on 
your emotional register.” 

Darius’ tolerant face framed an 
understanding smile. “I wouldn’t 
worry about that. I mean, if I’m 
still determined to kill myself, then 
the observation circuits which 
your people have so cunningly 
concealed in this room will very 
soon throw me into stasis. Isn’t 
that correct?” 



180 



IF 




The young man nodded, but did 
not seem able to shake his uneasi- 
ness. Preventing people like Dar- 
ius Wynter from taking their life 
was one thing — the emotional 
registers built into the house mon- 
itored the degree of the subject’s 
depression and were always 
ready to forestall any self-de- 
structive act — but it was also his 
sworn duty to safe-guard the 
mental health of his client. “1 urge 
you to relax, Mr. Wynter. I will 
summon a therapist and — ” 

Darius waved a deprecating 
hand. “That won’t be necessary. I 
assure you; 1 have never felt bet- 
ter in my life. And I do wish you’d 
stop Fiddling with that thing. It’s 
probably registering something 
left over from a few moments ago. 
Strange, but it already seems ages 
ago. You shouldn’t worry about 
my making another attempt— af- 
ter all, ninety-nine percent of all 
suicide attempts are decisions of 
the moment, are they not? And 
once that particular moment is 
past the mind has a chance to re- 
consider its motives.’’ He smiled 
and picked up the ornate little 
handgun and held it fondly. 

The young man tensed. 

“Don’t worry,’’ Darius laughed. 
“As you very well know, the mo- 
ment 1 turn this beautiful little 
weapon against myself — or make 
any other move that threatens my 
existence — the circuits will apply 
stasis. But note — as long as I keep 
it pointed away from myself they 



do not react.’’ The gun was now 
pointing in the general direc- 
tion of the Follower. “Take a 
quick peek at your meter,’’ Darius 
directed. “Is it still registering 
strong depression, suggesting 
suicidal tendencies?’’ 



T he young man shook his head. 

He was conscious of the deadly 
weapon pointing vaguely in his di- 
rection and puzzled by the con- 
tradictions provided by his 
meter. He was getting a reading 
that vacillated between minor de- 
pression and sudden elation — the 
latter, he knew from experience 
and training, was the feeling of 
relief that enveloped the subject 
when he realized that his life had 
been saved and his ridiculous act 
subverted. 

“So why don’t you relax?’’ Dar- 
ius suggested. Mischievous 
humor danced across his face. 
“There’s nothing to worry about. 
And I’m rather enjoying your 
company at the moment. Tell me; 
haven’t you ever wondered why 
there’s such a high incidence of 
attempted suicide among the im- 
mortals?’’ This was the name that 
had somehow become attached, 
albeit romantically, to the 
world’s leading industrialists, 
politicians and artists and all those 
who had managed to survive, like 
Darius Wynter, longer than any- 
body else because they were 
wealthy enough to maintain their

181 




rejuvenation treatments for 
more that two hundred years. 

The young man said nothing, 
only stared at him with a mixture 
of puzzlement and uneasiness. 

“But surely,” Darius went on, 
“you must have wondered, at 
some time or another why we, 
who have lived for so long and en- 
joyed every boon life knows, 
should suddenly want to end it. 
And try over and over again. 
Doesn’t the duality puzzle 
you — that we court our own deaths 
unpredictably and at the same 
time take out this costly insur- 
ance to guard against dying? If 
‘immortality’ is worth so much 
wealth and effort, why do we seek 
to abuse it when we have it?” His 
face softened. Some of the humor 
drained from his eyes and he stud- 
ied the little weapon in his hands 
thoughtfully, his fingers ca- 
ressing the delicate filigree. 

“It isn’t boredom, you know. 
That’s the popular misconcep- 
tion. God knows there’s enough 1 
haven’t done to keep me occupied 
for quite a few centuries yet. Ab- 
solute wealth requires absolute 
management — I haven’t nearly 
as much time to myself as I would 
like. Yet to live forever I must 
manufacture wealth to make this 
possible — you follow?” 

A flicker of interest showed in 
the young man’s eyes — and a little 
confusion as well. Darius pressed 
on, warming to his topic. 

“So it isn’t boredom. Rather, it’s 



a basic conflict within ourselves. 
It’s been there since man first be- 
came intelligent and adapted to 
his world — and iCs been cruelly 
accentuated by the boon of long- 
evity. From the moment we 
recognized the existence of time 
we have walked hand in hand with 
futility — the anti-agathics have 
also given us more time to con- 
sider the dim worthlessness of 
achievement. But that is only the 
consideration of our intel- 
lect — the animal part of us will 
cling tenaciously to life for want of 
a suitable substitute. The intel- 
lect cries out that all activity is 
dross, that nothing lasts forever, 
that even the weariest river flows 
somewhere to sea; but the primi- 
tive, unthinking part of us de- 
mands that we endure. 

“That is the struggle — to endure. 
And in the past most of us have. It 
is the prospect of immortality 
that makes life so dull for us — and 
sometimes the intellect wins and 
takes it upon itself to end the 
dreadful duality. At such mo- 
ments we try to take 6ur lives — but 
the animal in us reasserts itself if 
we can be prevented from taking 
the final, irrevocable step and are 
pulled back abruptly to the real 
world. And we are again prepared 
to cling to life with renewed 
tenacity. But most of that you must 
already know. The information 
is included in your training.” 

The young man agreed that this 
was so. 



182 



IF 




“You must realize, then, that 
ninety-nine percent of your calls 
are merely attempted suicides. 
Your intervention allows them 
the catharsis of decision and en- 
sures their gratitude — but what 
about that other one per cent?” 

The young man thought for a 
moment. “They are, by defini- 
tion, insane,” he replied. “Their 
desire to take their own lives is 
not so much a product of depres- 
sion but of a mind which has rea- 
soned itself out of existence.” 

“Quite so,” Darius agreed. He 
waved the little laser slowly back 
and forth, always keeping it di- 
rected in the general direction of 
the Follower. “And tell me, what 
are the symptoms of this sort of 
mind? I mean, how are they reg- 
istered on that little meter you 
have there?” 

The young, man licked suddenly 
dry lips. “By — by an unnaturally 
high elation.” His eyes remained 
Fixed on the dial in front of him. He 
looked suddenly afraid. 



D arius leaned forward and 
rested his elbows on the desk. 
The barrel of the gun now pointed 
unwaveringly at the young man. 

“If you’re so keen to kill your- 
self,” the Follower said, “why not 
simply cancel your premium? 
Then you could take your life with- 
out fear of intervention.” 

He was talking for time and 
Darius knew it. 



“But to do so would spoil the 
game,” he said. 

“Game? What game?” 

“The game of so-called immor- 
tality. To cancel my policy would 
ensure that the next time my in- 
tellectual despair got the better 
of me there would be nobody 
around to stop me when I opted for 
oblivion. And that would be dread- 
ful. You see, this animal we have 
inside us is old and wise and every 
bit as determined to endure as 
our fiendish intellect is to dis- 
pose of us — and in most cases it 
will have its way.” 

“It’s all a farce,” the young man 
blustered. “You know you’ll never 
succeed. You just play out this lit- 
tle game to assuage your ego.” 

“No, that’s not correct. You see, 
there’s always the chance — small, I 
must admit— that our Follower 
won’t be on hand at the exact sec- 
ond that he’s needed. Or that the 
observation circuits will mal- 
function — or something equally 
stimulating will occur. Those have 
happened occasionally — haven’t 

they?” 

The young man looked uncom- 
fortable. “I believe so. Once or 
twice, perhaps — no more.” 

“No more? But no matter. Even 
those few instances are sufficient 
to bring an element of chance into 
the situation. I’ll admit that the 
odds are astronomically in your 
favor — but that little uncertain- 
ty remains and gives spice to the 
game. It introduces the fascinat- 



THE IMMORTAL 



183 




ing concept that one's death does 
ultimately rest in the arms of blind 
chance — a prospect that fasci- 
nates the intellect as much as it re- 
pels the animal part of the mind." 

An expression of pain passed 
briefly across the face of the im- 
mortal. “Oh, I really am sorry. I 
shouldn't be talking like this to 
one as young as yourself. To you 
the universe must seem a marve- 
lous place and life itself a con- 
stant source of pleasure." 

The young man's troubled face 
denied this. 

“How terribly thoughtless of me 
to introduce this dark philoso- 
phy in to your aspiring young 
mind. But let me caution you, my 
lad — do not covet longevity. It is 
a boon with barbs in its tail and 
these will dig down ijjto your heart 
and tear out your hope, your 
dreams and your confidence. The 
ancients were right — three score 
years and ten is time enough to 
consider the mocking ghost of 
time; more than that is a burden 
which a man cannot bear, be- 
cause he was made to be mortal. 
We mock the gods when we out- 
live our allotted span — and their 
wrath is devious." 

The young man had inched 
slowly back towards the glowing 
portal behind him while Darius 
talked. 

“Don't do that, please," the im- 
mortal directed. “If you take one 
more step I will kill you where you 
stand." 



The Follower frozd to the carpet, 
stunned. 

Darius tightened his finger 
across the firing stud of the hand- 
weapon. His hand was steady and 
the expression on his face was de- 
termined. “Do I frighten you? Did 
you ever consider this, that I 
might take your life?" He smiled 
crookedly. “The circuits in these 
walls wouldn't stop me if I did. Af- 
ter all, they are only programed 
to prevent me from taking my own 
life, not from taking someone 
else's." 

With a great effort the young 
man pulled himself together. “I 
think you'd better put that down, 
sir. You need help. I'll call a thera- 
pist and — " 

“No you won't." 

“But, sir — you need help! You 
need care and attention and — " 

“I need nothing of the sort," 
Darius interrupted. “Tell me, 
young man, is there any way you 
could prevent me taking your life, 
if I wished?" 

His Follower said nothing. But 
Darius noted with satisfaction 
that his right hand had strayed to 
the wide steel belt around his waist 
and was hovering nervously over 
one of the bright switches. 

“I know for a fact," Darius 
pointed out, “that you can gen- 
erate a fairly effective force field 
from that belt of yours — adequate 
enough to repel the more com- 
monplace energies of our Tech- 
nology but hardly likely to dis- 



184 



IF 




place the concentrated output of 
a finely tuned laser — ” 

The young man’s face tele- 
graphed a look of pure terror. His 
right hand twitched and snapped 
down against the switch on his belt 
in a desperate gamble. 

An expression of wild exultance 
leaped into Darius Wynter’s eyes 
and he pressed the firing stud on 
the beautiful handgun with in- 
tense satisfaction. 

He had surreptitiously adjusted 
the small dial on the bridge of the 
weapon while he talked, A wide 
beam of energy reached out for the 
terrified Follower. His protec- 
tive screen went up a fraction of a 
second before the ravenous 
force leaped at him — a fact the im- 
mortal had insured by calcu- 
lating his firing delay to the exact 
fraction of a second — and the 
charge ricocheted away from 
the feeble — but, in this case, effec- 
tive enough — shield. 

The widely beamed energy 
bounced back from the protected 
figure and raced toward the wide 
window looking out over the 
timeless sea. 

Darius Wynter caught the full 
force of the charge calmly. His 
desk was engulfed and incin- 
erated in an instant and the life 
was torn from his weary body and 
blasted out through a great rent in 
the window. 

W HEN the smoke cleared the 
stunned and frightened Fol- 



lower saw the burned and disfig- 
ured body of his client poised in an 
incongruous attitude. The protec-' 
tive circuits had whirled into 
action much too late to save the life 
of Darius Wynter but they had 
thrown this dreadful husk into 
stasis and kept it in position, sit- 
ting in the charred ruin of a chair 
that would have collapsed under 
his living weight, and surrounded 
by the still smoldering ashes of his 
desk. 

The young man stood in a state 
of shock for some time. He was 
overcome by a terrible sense of 
failure that was somehow related 
to something more personal than 
the mere loss of a client. Eventu- 
ally he shook himself out of this 
state and walked over to survey the 
mocking corpse. 

Its dreadful charred face looked 
back at him. A cold wind howled in 
the space where the Window had 
been, but was powerless to move 
the lightest ash in the room. 

The young man shuddered. And 
then he kneeled for the second 
time to activate a switch on the 
small black box he had left on the 
floor. 

The room shimmered and 
dissolved as the stasis effect was' 
canceled out. The grotesque 
figure of the dead man collapsed 
slowly into a soft pile of ashes on 
the charred floor, where the 
mournful sea wind stirred it gent- 
ly and rolled away the mocking 
smile of triumph. •

He fattened on knowledge — until 
consumed by a greater wisdom! 



<4V^E CAN give you knowl- 
▼ ▼ edge,” said the salesman- 
thing. 

Claude Mabry looked all 
around his room: mildewed wall- 
paper, broken linoleum, dirty long 
underwear slung over a chair that 
had a weak leg, the clock face that 
had been cracked and repaired so 
many times with scotch tape that 
he could hardly see it said 3:20. 

“I’m smart ertough for me,” he 
said. “There’s such a thing as being 
too smart for your own good.” 

“That’t right,” said the sales- 
man-thing, “and there’s such a 
thing as being so smart you have to 
wash dishes down at Stan’s Chili 
Bowl to earn enough to live — 
here.” 

Claude could not reply. The 
whole thing reminded him of the 
Bible: a snake or whatever it was 
dressed up like a man, offering 
“knowledge” — it just didn’t make 
sense. 

“Look, I don’t mean to be un- 
pleasant,” said the salesman. “But 
we Guzz are a hell of a lot more 
powerful and a hell of a lot 
smarter than your species. If we’d 
wanted to, we could have vaporized 
your whole planet — but it’s not our 
way. So when somebody comes 
offering to make you smart, don’t 
knock it.” 

Claude wanted to rip off that 
grinning, false mansuit and see 
what the Guzz looked like. He 
half-rose, then sank back again and 
looked at the floor. 



“If you’re so good, why do you 
want to do anything for me?” 

“I don’t want to do anything for 
you. I voted to turn Earth into a 
bird refuge. But we have a 
democratic form of government 
and the majority wanted to make 
your kind fit citizens to share the 
universe with us.” 

“All right, how do I know you 
can make me smart?” 

The salesman opened his brief- 
case and took out a handful of 
bright brochures. “Don’t take my 
word for it that we can make you 
one of the smartest men on 
Earth,” he said. “Don’t take it 
from me that being smart is 
worthwhile. Millions are trying 
our plan. Thousands have tried it 
already. Have a look.” 

He handed Claude a folder 
showing full-color pictures of 
quiet scholars, white-coated 
scientists, dignified judges and 
beaming businessmen. Their 
testimonials were capped with red 
headlines:

duced another slick booklet and 
began turning the pages, showing 
Claude pictures of happy house- 
wives and hairy-handed laborers 
reading heavy volumes, farmers 
peering through microscopes and 
grannies using slide rules. “We call 
our system the Interface Way. Ev- 
ery person we accept must study at 
least two subjects intensively. If 
the subjects are unrelated, all the 
better. We mix mathematics with 
literature, we throw theoretical 
physics at a medical specialist, we 
give the mathematician theology.” 
“What would I get?” 

“If we accepted you, you’d be 
tested. Then we’d know.” 

“What do you mean, if?” Claude 
felt he had just been offered a mil- 
lion-dollars, but at the word “if” 
it had shrunk to about a nickle 
The stranger, sensing his 
anxiety, spoke soothingly. “Don’t 
worry too much about that. We 
won’t be testing your I.Q. or 
previous knowledge. In fact, the 
less of either, the better. We want 
people who haven’t had a chance, 
people who feel useless because 
the sleeping genius within them 
has never been awakened. What do 
you say?” 

“I don’t know. What would it 
cost me?” 

“All the money in the world 
couldn’t buy you a better educa- 
tion pal. But all it costs is your 
signature.” 

“Well— oh, hell, why not?” 

“Why not?” echoed the sales- 



man, handing him a pen. Claude 
signed a few forms in various 
colors and the salesman gave him 
a copy of each. 

“Claude,” he said, “you’ve just 
made your first intelligent deci- 
sion.” 



T he Guzz had pretty well 
taken over Earth, in every 
way. Guzz-developed gadgets were 
in every home. Clergymen thanked 
the Lord from their pulpits that 
the Guzz were not warlike or vi- 
cious but a truly democratic — ah 
— people. The government made 
daily announcements of new Guzz 
gifts to humanity. 

They quietly disarmed the 
nuclear powers, they made efficient 
clean-air and sewage-disposal 
systems for our cities, they intro- 
duced new food sources and birth- 
control plans in Asia. Hardly a 
government bureau in the world 
had not been approached by the 
Guzz with a suggestion or a 
gift — and these aliens used no 
stronger forces than tact and 
kindly persuasion. 

The only disagreeable thing 
about them was the way they 
looked — both at home and in 
Earth-drag. 

On their own planet (or so it 
was said, for no one had yet vis- 
ited them) the Guzz were dis- 
agreeably vermiform. Here, so as 
not to spook the natives, they 
wore human forms of plastic.

IF 




Their movements in these were na- 
tural enough, but they all looked 
alike. As far as most people, in- 
cluding Claude, were concerned, 
the Guzz were just so many talk- 
ing store-window dummies. 



T he first box that arrived was a 
table-top computer equipped 
with keyboard, microphone, speak- 
er and visual display screen. That 
night when he returned from Stan’s 
Chili Bowl, Claude lay awake 
looking at all that gleaming, com- 
plicated junk and wondering if he 
might have made a mistake in even 
hoping. 

Next day three packages arrived. 
The first contained books and a 
sheaf of documents: a certification 
that Claude Mabry was eligible for 
this correspondence course, more 
copies of the various forms he’d 
signed— and a booklet entitled: 
Welcome, Future Genius! 

The government of Guzz and 
your own government wish to 
take this opportunity to wel- 
come you. conditions and by- 
laws. You may not always 
see the reasons for instructions 
given you in this course, but 
they are necessary to ensure ef- 
ficient use of your time. 

The enclosed books are for 
Lesson One. The books required 
for each lesson will be provided 
with the lesson. At various 
points in the program you will 



be asked to study them 

thoroughly. 

Claude glanced at the titles of 
the books: The Interpretation of 
Dreams, Sigmund Freud; Verbal 
Behavior, B.F. Skinner; Towards 
Information Retrieval, Fairthorne; 
were only a few. 

The dream book looked interest- 
ing but inside, like all the others, it 
was full of long-winded sentences 
that didn’t mean anything. 

The second package contained a 
tape cassette titled: Program for 
Lesson One and simple instruc- 
tions for loading it into the teach- 
ing computer. 

As soon as Claude could do so*, 
he switched on the machine. He 
might have expected it to give him 
a problem, to register the fact that 
it was turned on, or at least to ask 
his name, but it did none of these 
things. 

Instead, it politely requested 
him to eat a sandwich. 

Claude scratched his head. The 
Guzz had to be joking. He could 
imagine them watching him right 
now, laughing at his stupidity. So 
this was the big learning course! 
So this... 

He remembered the third 
package and tore it open. Inside 
was a cellophane-wrapped sand- 
wich. THbugh Claude turned it over 
and over, he could see only one 
difference between this and any 
other cellophane-wrapped sand- 
wich: Inside the wrapper was a

plain printed name slip. But instead 
of “ham and cheese” or “peanut 
butter and grape jelly” it simply 
read: Eat me. 

The bread was a little stale but 
he enjoyed the salami or para- 
salami inside. 

An hour later he correctly 
answered a request to explain 
how and why dreams were subject 
to syntactical rules. The answer 
,^as obvious. 

Two hours later he had read 
Ayer’s The Problem of Knowl- 
edge, read it at skimming speed be- 
cause it was already perfectly fa- 
miliar to him. 

A lesson or two later Claude had 
gone through about fifty difficult 
books without any trouble. He 
progressed rapidly through the 
programs, though it did not seem 
like progress at all: he simply knew 
what he was doing. Using Fourier 
analysis to solve problems in elec- 
tronics seemed something he had 
always known, just as he had al- 
ways realized the gross truth of 
Newtonian mechanics and the fin- 
er truth of quantum mechanics, 
the position of Hubert Van Eyck in 
Flemish painting, the syllogistic 
properties of an Andrew Marvell 
poem, the flaws in the historical 
theories of Spengler and Toynbee 
— or for that matter, how to pre- 
pare sauce ozene with seven ingre- 
dients. Scraps of learning, areas of 
learning, even whole complex 
structures of learning were sudden- 
ly his. 



Having learned, he worked. By 
the fourth lesson Claude had gone 
through Godel’s proof of the nec- 
essary incompletness of mathe- 
matical theorems and picked holes 
in Lucas’s application of this to 
mechanical devices. He had also 
put forth an aesthetic theory un- 
derstandable by perhaps ten men, 
refutable by no more than one. He 
had nearly destroyed mathemati- 
cal economics, and devised a tenta- 
tive translating machine. He was 
hardly aware that these things had 
not been done before, nor was he 
really aware of the transition from 
his job at the Chili Bowl to a re- 
search fellowship at a prominent 
university. 



T he transition came about from 
his publication of various 
monographs in journals, the names 
of which he knew only from foot- 
notes in the books he was skim- 
ming. Some of the monographs 
came back. He had sent them to 
wrong addresses, or to journals 
long out of print. 

Others, like his “Queueing The- 
ory Applied to Neural Activity” 
and “On Poetic Diction,” became 
classics. Men with tweedy manners 
but sharp suits and clean attache 
cases came to see him. They sat in 
the steamy, oily kitchen of Stao’s 
Chili Bowl and talked with him 
about quasar explanations, new 
codes of international law and log- 
ic mechanisms. True, many prodi-

IF 




gies were springing up now that the 
Guzz offered their massive home 
study program. But for the time 
being, genius was still something 
universities fought over. And so, 
almost without knowing it (he was 
thinking of other things), Claude 
Mabry gave Stan his notice, 
packed his T-shirts and blue jeans 
and entrained for Attica Univer- 
sity. 

He remembered only isolated 
facts about this trip: sending a 
change-of-address card to the 
Guzz; losing his ticket; not bring- 
ing enough pager (and so alighting 
from the train at Attica, where 
University officials were waiting to 
greet him, his hands so full of slips 
of toilet paper on which were pen- 
ciled notes toward a theory of his- 
tory that he could not accept the 
handshakes of these venerables). 
Without comment he settled into 
his new life and went on working. 

From time to time he wondered 
what was in the sandwich that 
came with each lesson. A wonder 
drug that unlocked hidden knowl- 
edge. that lay “sleeping” within 
him? An intelligence accelerator? 
Whatever it was, it was essential 
to the process. The only time he’d 
tried studying without it, Claude 
had floundered among symbols 
that almost made sense. 

He wondered, too, about the 
Guzz. The little he learned about 
their planet and culture (in the final 
lesson) whetted his appetite for 
more. He longed to know every- 



thing about them, almost to 
become one of them: They alone 
would understand what he was 
doing. It was becoming clear that 
his colleagues at the university 
considered him some kind of 
freak — he would not wear a suit, he 
could not converse about depart- 
mental politics and he was inhu- 
manly intelligent. 

Claude ordered all the informa- 
tion on the Guzz he could get. This 
proved to be a slim volume by a 
second-rate anthropologist who 
had interviewed a few of the 
aliens. Claude skimmed it and 
began a treatise of his own. 

“Despite the advanced ‘democ- 
racy’ of the Guzz,” he wrote, 
“they retain a few oddly ‘primi- 
tive,’ even sacramental habits.” 

There was a knock at the door. 
The standard face of a Guzz look- 
ed around the frame, saw that he 
was alone and walked its standard 
body into the office. Without say- 
ing anything, it came over and 
struck hiiti on the forehead. 
Twitching, Claude slipped to the 
floor. The visitor busied itself with 
a set of plastic bags. 

The fallen man was muttering. 
Bending lower, the man-shape 
heard: “...planarian worms? DNA 
or...?” 

“Right you are!” boomed the 
Guzz. “Yes, we are analogous to 
your planarian worms — so, of 
course, are you — and we can 
transmit behavior genetically.” 

He fished a long knife from one 



THE MAN WHO DEVOURED BOOKS 



191 




bag and tested its blade against a 
false thumb. “Of course our genes 
need help. Obviously our — 1 mean 
to include your — children do not 
learn much from their parents’ 
genes. But these same genes, 
properly assimilated — ” 

“I knew it!” Claude croaked, 
getting up on one elbow. The blow 
had stunned him, but still the 
machinery of his mind ground on. 
With an estatic expression he said, 
“The old taboos against eating the 
king, eating the old man, the sage, 
the father yes?” 

“Check.” With a hearty chuckle 
the visitor kneeled by Claude’s side 
and felt for the carotid artery. 
“Those ridiculous taboos have 
kept your species back hundreds 
of thousands of years. We’re just 



now making up the lost time for 
you.” 

“The sandwich meat — ” 

“Housewives, mechanics, pro- 
fessional people — all the people in 
that brochure you saw. Just think 
of it!” He waved the knife orator- 
ically, and the plastic face turned 
up, as if gazing at a vista. “One 
genius provides three thousand 
sandwiches, each capable of pro- 
viding — with no wastage— part of 
the education for one more genius! 
Thus learning will transform your 
whole species — you will become as 
gods!” 

The Guzz returned his attention 
to the matter at hand. He poised 
the knife. 

“Superman,’’ nfurmured the 
genius. “On white or rye.” •
