HE NEVER SLEPT! That was the 

title of a story by John Russell 
Fearn published 20 years ago and 
remembered by me to this day. I 
may also remember it as my motto 
for the Glevention: during 120 ter- 
rific hours of conventioning, I slept 
approximately 12 ! Last day and nite 
of all I went clean ’round the clock. 

The incentive for this anti-Mor- 
pheus marathon? Who could sleep 
with the opportunity at hand to get 
the first-hand information on ASP 
(Artificial Satellite Program) 
straight from the maestro’s mouth? 
— to hear Willy Ley in person, let- 
ting his distinguished hair down 
with the s.f. aficionados. Who 
could sleep with the clown princes 
of the imagi-nation, Bob Bloch, 
Bob Tucker and Isaac Asimov, con- 
stantly tickling the funnybone? 
Who wanted shuteye with the pro- 
jectoscope programs showing fa- 
mous collectors’ choicest items 
(First Editions, foreign editions, 
unpublished magazines, rare art 
work, doppelgangers, etc.) on a 
large screen, accompanied by 


miked descriptions by Sam Mos- 
kowitz, Dr. C. L. Barrett, and 
Weaver Wright, curator of Mis- 
katonic University? Who wouldn’t 
be ashamed to sleep in the pres- 
ence of the British beauty, Pamela 
Bulmer, and what a shame it 
would have been to’ve slept and 
missed any of the whimsical humor 
of husband Ken, fan and author 
from England who was Interna- 
tional Guest of Honour of the oc- 
casion. 

Run this list of favorite authors 
over your tongue: Damon Knight, 
Fritz Leiher, Mark Clifton, Judith 
Merril, Randall Garrett, Leigh 
Brackett, Edmond Hamilton, Rog 
Phillips, Russ Winterhotham, Ed- 
ward E. Smith, E. Everett Evans, 
Lloyd Eshbach, Betsy Curtis, 
Thelma Hamm, James E. Gunn, 
Jim Harmon, Bob Silverberg, 
Wallace West, Frank Riley, Bob 
Bloch, and many others. Nearly 
every “pro” present was a guest of 
the University of Chicago Science- 
Fiction Club at an afternoon auto- 
graph party, and the ink flowed 
like wine, with many a fen bring- 
ing home a fine memento of the oc- 
casion in the form of a personally 
inscribed book. 

At one time at 2 a.m. conven- 
tioneers were in the midst of en- 
joying a revival of the classic fan- 
tasy film, Lost Horizon. The first 
nite of all, conventioneers were 
immediately put in a jovial mood 
by being shown the scientificomedy 
riot starring Alec Guiness, The 
Man in the White Suit . A feature 
of this Convention that I found 
especially pleasing was the showing 
of motion picture records of a num- 


2 




ber of past Conventions, in a pro- 
gram assembled by cameraman 
Bill Grant of Canada. (Was that 
sans-moustached, harlequin-glass- 
ed, twenty pounds slimmer guy I 
caught a glimmer of in the 1948 
Toronto films really me?) And 
there was Walt Willis, world’s fa- 
vorite fan, at the banquet in Chi- 
cago in ’52; and Hugo Gemsback, 
the Father of Science Fiction; and 
AE van Vogt, “the man in the 
bright suit” ; and Charles Beaumont 
and John Campbell and Margaret 
St Clair and Philip Jos6 Farmer 
and more interesting people than 
you’d care to shake a slipstick at. 
And for me, a first glimpse at the 
goings-on of the first Convention 
I ever missed, the Nolacon: New 
Orleans’ convention of 1951, the 
year my Dad died when I was en- 
route. 

AMONG THE BEASTS of science 
fiction (and all its wolves are not 
of the wehr variety) walks great 
beauty. San Francisco gave us The 
Goddess Known as Jessyca: sup- 
ple, silver reed of womanhood, 
bending in the wind of the sighs 
of her would-be wooers, her strick- 
en swains. Jessyca the remote, the 
unapproachable, the dweller on the 
pink cloud. Jessyca — unbelievably, 
a fan — the unforgettable. 

That was 1954. 

Time rockets on. 

1955 : and from the mists of ob- 
scurity, from northeast of nowhere, 
drifting into the ken of fen and 
pro’s alike from some unlikely 
miniscule pin-mark on the map of 
the United States, came (remem- 
ber the name, and ask for an in- 


troduction at the next convention) 

. Ruth Landis ! She came, she 
saw, she conquered. Queen for a 
Day? Nay, Queen for the Conven- 
tion. She moved always in the 
highest echelons. (It could prob- 
ably be said she sat in the laps of 
the Gods!) All paid court to her; 
and if there were giants in the 
“good old days” of stf, before it 
put on a bow-tie and went sci-fi on 
us, there never were such living 
dolls reading our favorite litera- 
ture. Twenty years ago we male 
fans would have welcomed a cross- 
eyed gal with buck teeth (and not 
even balked at the cost of her 
teeth) just to know the compan- 
ionship of a female fan. Today, in 
La Landis, we discover a Grace 
Kelly who’s been reading s.f. for 
10 years! Will wonders never cease! 
(We hope not.) For the good of all 
fankind (and the professionals who 
made her their ubiquitous mascot) 
may her tribe increase. 

RIDING BACK from Cleveland to 
Chicago I had the good fortune 
to have as a companion James E. 
Gunn, one of the newer voices in 
science fiction who’s going places. 
Jim gave one of the most solid, 
most perceptive speeches at the 
Convention — “The Function of 
Science Fiction”. I asked him if, 
in his s.f. writings, he felt he had 
anything special to say or was 
pointing any way in particular, and 
got an answer that I liked : he said 
he was trying to write stories with 
an optimistic note and a belief in 
human beings. When Jim and I 
parted company, It was with the 
feeling on my part that if we had

What can a man do when he alone 




must decide the fate of Earth and all 


its people — and when the choices 
offered him are slavery and death . 



S I T U AT I O N 


BY JAMES MC CONNELL 


C APTAIN ALLEN HAWKINS stood quietly in 
the observation room of the Sunward looking 
out at subspace. He was a medium-sized man with 
a trim squareness to him that suggested he had 
been in the military most of his life. He had a good 
deal of gold on his sleeve and a good deal of sliver 
in his hair, and he had discovered in his many 
years in the Space Navy that the two usually went 
hand in hand. In the background he could hear 


5 


the noise and ordered confusion of 
the ship’s bridge. But at the mo- 
ment he paid it little attention, 
concentrating instead on the ob- 
servation window. 

It was not the first time that he 
had stood thus, gazing at whatever 
lay beyond the shell of the ship. Al- 
most every time he had put the 
Sunward through the dark shadow 
of subspace, he had deserted the 
bridge for at least a few moments 
to come and stare out the window. 

“God,” he said out loud, repress- 
ing a shiver that wanted to crawl 
down his spine. 

“Perhaps ‘God forsaken* would 
be a better description,** came a 
voice from behind him. 

The voice belonged to Dr. J. L. 
Broussard, the Sunward’s senior 
psychologist. And although the two 
men were on more than casually 
friendly terms, Hawkins didn’t turn 
to greet him. The fascination of 
the observation port seemed to ob- 
viate the normal requirements of 
courtesy. “At times like this I think 
you’re right. ‘God forsaken.’ That’s 
just what it is,” Hawkins said. 
“Completely black, completely 
empty. You know, it frightens me 
every time we make the jump 
through it.” 

A voice from the bridge called 
out, “Twelve minutes until zero. 
No noticeable deviations, Captain.” 

“Very well,” Hawkins said loud- 
ly enough to be heard on the 
bridge. 

“Perhaps it frightens all of us 
just a little,” said Broussard. He 
leaned his oversized body against 
the observation room wall. His big, 
mild face had a relaxed look to it. 


“I wonder why it affects us that 
way,** he added almost as if it were 
a casual afterthought, but his eyes 
had a too-shrewd look to them. 

“You’re the psychologist. You 
tell me why,” Hawkins said. He 
paused for just a moment, expect- 
ing Broussard to reply. But after a 
few seconds when the man gave 
him no conversational support, 
Hawkins continued. “For my part, 
I guess it frightens me because — 
well, because a man seems to get 
lost out there. In normal space 
there are always stars around, no 
matter how distant they may be, 
and you feel that you’ve got direc- 
tion and location. In subspace, all 
you’ve got is nothing — and one hell 
of a lot of that.” He pushed his cap 
back until it perched comfortably 
on the rear of his head. “It’s in- 
credible when you stop to think 
about it. An area — an opening as 
big as the whole of our universe, 
big enough to pack every galaxy 
we’ve ever seen in it and still have 
lots of room left over. All that space 
— and not a single atom of matter 
in it anywhere.” Captain Hawkins 
shook his grayed head in wonder. 
“At least,” he went on. “Not a sin- 
gle atom in it until we came barg- 
ing in to use it as a short cut across 
our own universe.” 

The man on the bridge called 
out, “Ten minutes until zero. No 
noticeable deviations, Captain.” 
“Very well,” Hawkins answered. 
Broussard shifted his consider- 
able weight into a more comfort- 
able position. “You feel rather 
strongly about this, don’t you?” 
“That I do,” said Hawkins. As 
much as he enjoyed an occasional 


6 


JAMES MC CONNELL 



conversation with the psychologist, 
Broussard’s questions often got on 
his nerves. 

“Don’t you think it’s better we 
discovered subspace than if we 
were still back trying to beat the 
speed of light in our own uni- 
verse?” Broussard asked him. 

“Oh, stop looking for a dangling 
neurosis somewhere, Broussard,” 
Hawkins said, managing a smile. 
“You know quite well that I’ve got 
absolutely nothing at all against 
the use of subspace for ‘rapid trans- 
portation,’ so to speak. It’s just that 
I’m the sort of man who likes to 
know where he’s going all the time. 
And out here, in this stuff, you lose 
your sense of direction. There’s no 
up, no down, no in between. It 
took spacemen a long time to get 
accustomed to the wild freedom 
they found out in the middle of 
normal space. But at least there 
you could always head for a star if 
you got lost. Out here . .” He ges- 
tured futilely towards the blackness 
staring in at them from the win- 
dow. They stood silently contem- 
plating it for several moments. 

“Eight minutes until zero. No 
noticeable deviations, Captain,” 
came the voice from the bridge 
again. 

“Very well,” Captain Hawkins 
replied, breaking the brief silence 
between the two men. Then he 
went on, “Broussard, have you ever 
been out there in that stuff? Oh, I 
don’t mean like now, in a ship or a 
rescue craft. I mean in a spacesuit, 
all by yourself.” 

The psychologist shook his head. 
“No, I never have.” He paused for 
just a second, then added, “What’s 


it really like?” 

There were times, Hawkins 
thought, when even the phrasing of 
a simple question on Broussard’s 
part carried a slight sting. But like 
the brief pain that accompanies the 
probing point of a hypodermic 
needle, the tiny barbs contained in 
the man’s questions were soon for- 
gotten. Hawkins smiled. “It’s my 
own private guess of what hell will 
turn out to be. ‘God forsaken,’ did 
we say? That’s just about it. We 
stopped to repair a ship once, and 
some of us had to go outside to 
work on it. I guess I was out there 
for less than three hours — no more 
than that. And yet I was almost a 
madman by the time they hauled 
me back inside. I can’t explain 
why.” His voice trailed off into 
nothingness. “I guess it was just the 
blackness that did it.” 

“Six minutes until zero. No no- 
ticeable deviations, Captain.” 

“Very well.” For the first time 
Hawkins turned to face the psy- 
chologist. “During my training at 
the Academy they locked me up in 
a closet once, just as a joke. I was 
without light for hours, but it was 
nothing like that out there. You 
should know, Broussard. Why does 
it look so much blacker in that 
window now than any other black 
I’ve ever seen?” 

Broussard looked the man over 
carefully before answering, wonder- 
ing just exactly what sort of reply 
might be called for. “I think the 
reason is that you’ve got close to 
optimum conditions for it here in 
the observatory,” he said momen- 
tarily. “You always get the blackest 
shade of black inside a ring of 


AVOIDANCE SITUATION

white light. Look at the window.” 
Hawkins turned to do as directed. 
“There you’ve got a white frame 
surrounding the complete absence 
of light. That’s just about as good 
as you can get. No wonder it looks 
so black to you.” 

Hawkins shook his head, not so 
much in disbelief as in wonder. 

“As a matter of fact,” the psy- 
chologist continued almost in a 
hurry. “If you stayed out in sub- 
space all by yourself, with no ship 
near you and no light of your own, 
after a while it wouldn’t seem black 
to you at all. You’d get cortical 
adaptation, and things would just 
look gray. And not too long after 
that, you’d stop ‘seeing’ entirely, as 
we think of seeing. Or, as a friend 
of mine once said, under those 
conditions you’d ‘see’ as much with 
your elbows as you would with your 
eyes. Funny, isn’t it? We usually 
think of black as being the absence 
of light. And yet, in order to ‘see’ 
black, we’ve got to have at least a 
little light around every once in a 
while.” 

The watchman on the bridge 
droned out the time again. “Four 
minutes until zero. No noticeable 
deviations, Captain.” 

Allen Hawkins gave a large sigh, 
then readjusted the cap on his 
head. He had the feeling that 
Broussard’s little lecture on science, 
while factually accurate, was deliv- 
ered more to obscure the facts than 
to illuminate. “I’d better get to the 
bridge now, Broussard. Not that 
they really need me, but . He 
left the sentence dangling, then 
turned and walked briskly out of 
the observation room. 


O NCE IN the control room, he 
gave the dials and the illumi- 
nated screens a rapid, practiced 
glance and then sat down in his 
chair to one side of the operations 
panel. There was actually no 
known danger to this shifting back 
and forth from one space to an- 
other. No ship had ever encoun- 
tered any difficulties whatsoever in 
doing so; there had never been an 
accident of any kind during transi- 
tion. The whole thing was as com- 
pletely automatic as man could 
make it, and apparently entirely 
safe. But still Hawkins had never 
made the shift one way or another 
without feeling a telltale tightening 
of muscles deep inside him, and 
without wondering just what would 
happen if they got stuck in all that 
darkness. 

“One minute, Captain,” the 
watch officer reminded him. Haw- 
kins nodded in reply, his face il- 
luminated by the flashing lights on 
the control panel in front of him. 
He watched their changing signals 
calmly with knowing eyes. 

“Thirty seconds ... all drives 
off,” sang out a voice. The hands 
on the clock crept slowly around 
the dial. 

“Zero . .” 

There was no sound, no feeling, 
no jerk nor jar, no noise to mark 
the transition — nothing at all dif- 
ferent from the moment before ex- 
cept a slight increase in the total 
light flux in the room. 

Stars. 

Captain Allen Hawkins smiled 
softly to himself. Stars . some- 
thing to cling to, he whispered un- 
der his breath.

“Bridge from Navigation,” came 
a voice close to his ear. 

“Go ahead, Navigation,” he said 
after pressing the communications 
button. 

“Looks like we hit it right on the 
nose, Captain,” the Navigator told 
him. “Can’t tell just yet, of course, 
until I feed the positions of the 
nearest stars into Betsy and she de- 
cides where we are. But it looks 
good from here, and if I’m right, 
the one we’re hunting for is about 
eight o’clock high from the nose of 
the ship as she sits now. I’ll plot a 
course there right now. Do you 
want to wait until Betsy decides 
that’s the one, or shall we take a 
chance and head for it first?” 

The Navigator always asked the 
question, but he knew what the an- 
swer would be. “We’ll start just as 
soon as you can give us the course,” 
Hawkins replied. 

“Aye, aye. Captain,” the Navi- 
gator replied. 

Hawkins turned to the officer on 
duty. “Mr. Smith, you will remain 
as you are until you receive the 
course from the Navigator. Once 
you have it, you will get underway 
immediately.” 

“Aye, aye, Captain,” Smith re- 
plied. 

“I’ll be in my cabin if you want 
me,” Hawkins said as he left the 
bridge. He was rather tired and he 
meant to go straight to bed, but 
somehow he found himself stopping 
by the observation room en route. 
Broussard was still there, looking 
out of the window at the stars. 

“Lovely, aren’t they, Broussard?” 
Hawkins said. 

“So you feel the stars are love- 


ly?” the psychologist answered 
slowly. 

“Yes, I do. They give us light, 
and hope for the future, and more 
than that, a frame of reference 
when we fly through the dark 
reaches of our universe. They’re 
more than beautiful — they’re neces- 
sary.” As he turned to leave, Haw- 
kins chuckled to himself. Just let 
the head-shrinker try to read a neu- 
rosis into that! 

It took them three weeks from 
the day they arrived back in nor- 
mal space to make sure that they 
had found a sun with planets, and 
another three weeks from then to 
make landfall on the second of the 
four satellites this particular solar 
system had to offer. Almost from 
the very beginning they were elated 
with their luck, for the planet 
seemed to be a first class find. The 
Sunward and her crew had been 
exploring this section of space for 
more than six years, and out of the 
thirty-eight systems they had in- 
vestigated, this was the first that 
offered any promise of eventual hu- 
man habitation. 

Man had been in space less then 
one hundred years. At first he had 
thrown himself towards the stars 
with crude rocket-driven craft A 
few years later he had invented a 
type of atomic drive which allowed 
him to approach the speed of light. 
But it was the discovery of the sub- 
space technique of travel which had 
theoretically given him the whole 
universe to live in. There were 
drawbacks, however, and they were 
important ones. To tear himself 
from the matrix of normal space he

still needed huge machines, and 
probably always would. This meant 
the building of exceedingly large 
space vessels, like the Sunward , 
which could contain not only the 
equipment necessary to propel him 
into the blackness of subspace, but 
which also could be equipped with 
the mammoth control mechanisms 
necessary to regulate the change- 
over. The switch to subspace could 
never be made near the surface of 
a planet, for the field forces gen- 
erated during the change had far- 
flung effects and were quite cap- 
able, even under tightest control, 
of tearing loose a huge chunk of a 
planet and dropping it into subspace 
with the ship. Big ships meant big 
money, and even now there were 
fewer than a thousand of the large 
exploration craft in operation. Each 
ship could average fewer than ten 
new worlds a year. So while man 
had taken a lease on the universe, 
it seemed that at his present rate of 
exploration a great many centuries 
would pass before he finished the 
charting of even the stars in his 
own back yard. 

But if at times he became dis- 
couraged at the immensity of the 
task, there were always moments of 
great joy which helped to spur a 
man on. 

The men of the Sunward named 
the new star Clarion, and the 
habitable planet they called Trellis. 
It was the second of three large and 
one very small planets which cir- 
cled Clarion. The Sunward spent 
more than two weeks circling over 
Trellis, making maps and checking 
the atmosphere. Then the council 
of scientists on board picked a land- 


ing site and Captain Hawkins 
brought the ship down on the spot 
they had chosen. Exactly twentv- 
seven days from the hour they 
landed, the council voted unani- 
mously that Trellis was safe for hu- 
man habitation, and Allen Haw- 
kins gave the orders to have the 
hatches opened to the Trellian air. 

The Captain, as was customary, 
was the first man to set foot on the 
soil. He led the brief ceremonies 
that claimed the world as Earth’s 
own and then planted the Terran 
flag. He also took the customary 
measure of declaring it a ship’s 
holiday, and even threw out the 
first baseball when the inevitable 
game started up later in the after- 
noon. But he didn’t stay to watch, 
preferring to stroll around the land- 
scape by himself for a little while. 

He had been walking for a little 
more than an hour, traveling in a 
wide circle around the ship, when 
he came upon Dr. Broussard, sitting 
quietly under a shady tree, a book 
in one hand and a container of beer 
in the other. The beer looked good 
and cold, and the shade looked 
comfortable. “Mind if I join you?” 
Hawkins asked, and since he was 
Captain of the ship, scarcely waited 
for an invitation before he sat down 
and opened himself a beer. It tasted 
as good as it had looked, and 
Hawkins soon found himself in an 
expansive mood. “Tell me, Brous- 
sard,” he said good-naturedly. 
“How come you aren’t out snoop- 
ing around, making sure that the 
crew’s libidos aren’t acting up or 
something.” 

Cocking an ear towards the dis- 
tant ball field, rife with the excited 


10 


JAMES MC CONNELL 



noise that always accompanies such 
a game, Broussard replied, “It 
sounds to me as if the crew is get- 
ting about as much libidinal dis- 
charge as I could hope for under 
the circumstances. That being the 
case, I saw no reason why the ship’s 
alienist shouldn’t have a little time 
off.” 

Hawkins leaned back comfort- 
ably against the tree. “Alienist. 
That’s a pretty strange word these 
days, Broussard. Used to be what 
they called psychiatrists in England 
back in the old days, right?” Haw- 
kins was of vaguely English descent 
and felt it behooved him to know 
such things. 

“That’s right. They revived the 
term briefly a hundred years ago 
when we first got out into space, be- 
cause they thought that psycholo- 
gists might be needed for the first 
contacts with alien cultures.” A 
slight frown came over the man’s 
face. “The word’s fallen into disuse 
again of late, however,” he con- 
tinued. 

Captain Hawkins grunted in as- 
sent. “No aliens, eh?” 

“That’s right. No aliens. Thou- 
sands of new worlds, thousands 
upon thousands of new species, but 
not one of them intelligent enough 
to hold a candle to our earthside 
chimpanzee. But still they go on 
outfitting each of the exploration 
vessels with psychologists, and out- 
fitting all of the psychologists for 
the double task of soothing the 
crew’s psyches and making contact 
with mythical intelligent races that 
so far we’ve only dreamed about.” 
Broussard emptied his container of 
beer and with a single vicious 


movement threw it as far away 
from him as he could. “I must say, 
however, that of late they’ve been 
spending more time training us to 
be mind doctors than to be official 
greeters to unknown cultures.” 
Suddenly Broussard straightened 
up. “But why should you twit me 
about deserting my work today. I 
saw you throw out the first baseball. 
How come you didn’t stay for the 
game? Surely that falls under the 
province of a Captain’s job.” 

Allen Hawkins smiled. “I learned 
long ago, Broussard, that there are 
times when the presence of the 
Commanding Officer has an un- 
desired influence on the spirits of 
the crew. After all, as Captain of 
the Sunward , I can’t very well take 
part in the game itself. Who’d dare 
to strike me out when I came to 
bat?” He stopped to think about 
that for a moment. “Or, maybe I 
should have said, I don’t think any- 
body would dare to strike me out.” 
“Ah, yes, the Father Figure/' 
Broussard said laughing. 

“That’s right. So I can’t play. 
Nor can I umpire, for half the fun 
of baseball is arguing with the um- 
pire and I couldn’t allow any of 
that. And if I just watched without 
playing the game itself, a lot of the 
crew might think that I felt myself 
too high and mighty to take part in 
their proletarian type of recreation. 
So I’m damned if I do and damned 
if I don’t. So what did I do . .?” 
“You left the field,” Broussard 
answered, lighting up a cigarette 
after offering the other man one. 

“That’s right, I left the baseball 
field and went walking.” 

“That’s not quite what I meant 


AVOIDANCE SITUATION 


11 



when I said ‘you left the field/ ” 
Broussard went on. “It’s a psycho* 
logical term, first used by Lewin 
many centuries ago. Any time a 
man is in a conflict situation, faced 
with two or more alternatives that 
he finds it difficult to choose 
among, he may solve his problem 
by choosing none of them/ 5 

Hawkins stretched his legs out 
restfully on the grass in front of 
him. As he thought about it, there 
had been few times in the past 
when he had given the psychologist 
his head and let the man talk. 
Probably, Hawkins thought to him- 
self, Broussard spends most of his 
time listening to the petty confes- 
sions of all of us and never gets the 
opportunity to unload a bit himself. 
He caught himself wondering just 
who on Earth confesses the 
Pope . 

And so he uttered the magical 
words, “I don’t think I quite un- 
derstand . .” 

Broussard scarcely needed the 
encouragement to continue. “Lewin 
liked to think of psychological sit- 
uations as approximating physical 
situations. He spoke in terms of 
valences and attractions, of vectors 
and forces operating through psy- 
chological distances. For example, 
let’s consider the case of a child put 
into a long hallway. At one end of 
the hall is a large, fierce dog. At the 
other end is an ugly man with a big 
switch. We tell the child that he 
has to go to one end of the hall or 
the other. This becomes an ‘avoid- 
ance-avoidance’ situation in the 
Lewinian terminology. Both the 
man with the switch and the fierce 
dog carry negative valences — that 


means that the child actually 
doesn’t want to approach either of 
them — and the closer the child 
comes to one of them, the more 
powerfully it repels him. Just as 
with magnets — the closer you bring 
one negative charge to another 
negative charge, the more power- 
ful is the force of repulsion.” 
Captain Hawkins smiled. It 
wasn’t going to be as bad as he had 
feared. “What does all this have to 
do with baseball?” 

“We’ll get back to home plate in 
just a moment. But first, let’s con- 
tinue with the child. We put him in 
the hallway, tell him to go to one 
end or the other, and then we just 
sit back and watch. At first he 
stands about as close to the center 
of the hall as he can, assuming that 
the two negative valences are about 
of equal strength. He’s undecided 
— can’t make up his mind which is 
worse, the man or the dog. So we 
prompt him to action — shock him 
or tell him that he has to keep 
moving. Then he begins to move 
back and forth, vacillating between 
the two undesirable objects. So we 
apply more and more pressure to 
try to force him to a decision. But 
the closer he moves to the dog, for 
example, the more distasteful it 
becomes, and the less dangerous 
does the man seem to be. So the 
child turns around and starts to- 
wards the man. But here the situa- 
tion is repeated. It’s a beautiful ex- 
ample of a conflict situation.” 
Giving vent to a well-disciplined 
snort, Captain Hawkins said, “And 
eventually the child either gets well 
switched or badly bitten, eh?” 

“No, that’s where you’re wrong. 


12 


JAMES MC CONNELL 



Eventually the child tries to escape 
from the hallway altogether. Some- 
times he’ll try to climb the walls, or 
break down a door, or anything like 
that which will release him from 
what has become an impossible 
psychological environment.” 

“So,” said Hawkins. “I think you 
left me stranded on first base.” 

Broussard laughed. “Pardon the 
sermon, Captain. What I was try- 
ing to point out was that the base- 
ball game represented just about 
the same sort of thing to you as the 
hallway did to the child. Any time 
a human being is faced with two 
impossible decisions like that, he 
usually ends up by ‘leaving the 
field’ of conflict altogether. Now- 
adays we can even predict the exact 
field forces necessary to bring on 
this type of behavior.” 

“And what do you predict I’m 
going to do right now?” Hawkins 
asked with a bit of a laugh in his 
voice. 

“That’s an easy one. I predict 
you’re going to ask for another beer 
— and that I’ll give it to you. No 
conflict there.” He opened a con- 
tainer that chilled itself automat- 
ically as he handed it to his su- 
perior officer. 

Hawkins blew the foam from it 
and then took a long, satisfying 
swallow. “There are times when 
I’m glad I’m just an uncomplicated 
space officer,” he said presently. 

Broussard grinned. “Sorry if I 
seemed to be giving you a lecture, 
Captain. I’m afraid you would 
have enjoyed a good, healthy dis- 
cussion of Freud much more. My 
own particular problem is that I’m 
much more interested in thinking 


about the remote possibilities of 
man’s encountering new types of 
intelligences than I am in playing 
father confessor to a bunch of space 
rats. Back on Earth the social psy- 
chologists felt that Lewin’s work 
offered a fruitful means of analyz- 
ing the motivational components in 
any alien society we might encoun- 
ter. I guess my trotting out the vec- 
tor charts was just a neat example 
of wishful thinking.” 

Captain Allen Hawkins didn’t 
bother to answer the remark for 
some time. He was too busy watch- 
ing something move slowly towards 
them across the grassy plain. Final- 
ly he half -whispered to his com- 
panion, “Don’t put those charts 
away too soon, Broussard. You 
finally may have a chance to use 
them.” 


B ELLS CLANGED loudly. Red 
and yellow lights flashed insist- 
ently in front of the man, demand- 
ing his attention. The clattering 
noise of a computer working at high 
speed added to the unholy din of 
the small spaceship’s control room. 

Surveyor Lan Sur ran his deft 
fingers rapidly over the studs on the 
control panel in front of him. He 
scarcely looked at the controls as he 
manipulated them, concentrating 
instead on the screens before him — 
screens which showed the attack 
patterns of the seven large warships 
that surrounded him. 

One of the attacking enemy ships 
loomed incredibly large directly 
ahead of him. Lan Sur’s fingers 
hesitated, and then, at precisely the 
proper second, pressed the firing 


AVOIDANCE SITUATION 


13 


studs. The scout ship seemed to 
dance lightly upward as it passed 
high above the larger, slower enemy 
craft. Lan Sur whirled his ship 
around just in time to witness the 
total disintegration of the enemy. 

“One down,” he thought, but 
took no particular pride in his ac- 
complishment. There were still six 
left. 

The enemy regrouped, spreading 
out into a cone-like formation. He 
knew the trick well, and aimed his 
ship to make its next pass high 
above the open mouth of this for- 
mation. But the enemy opened up 
the top of the cone as fast as Lan 
Sur tried to avoid it. He fired a 
warning salvo and tucked his de- 
fensive screens in tight around him. 
But the uppermost enemy ship in- 
credibly picked up more speed, 
sliding off into an extremely intri- 
cate maneuver. Lan Sur knew that 
if it could hold to this path, it 
would pass several miles above him, 
neatly sandwiching him between 
the enemy vessels below. He could 
have turned aside at once, but that 
would have been an admission of 
possible defeat, and he could never 
admit defeat. If he could beat the 
other ship to the topping maneuver, 
he would destroy not only it, but the 
ships at the small end of the cone 
as well when he came crashing 
down on them from above. For just 
a moment he felt certain that he 
could succeed. 

The scout ship vibrated tensely 
as it hurled itself forward. The red 
lights on the control panel doubled 
in number, then tripled. The com- 
puter roared instructions so rapidly 
that he could hardly keep up with 


them. The warning bells went mad 
with ringing. 

“I think I can make it,” he told 
himself. But he refused to become 
excited. He had come this close to 
victory before, and had still failed. 
Now he saw he was gaining on the 
enemy ship, but it was a thin mar- 
gin of safety indeed. The computer 
screamed with danger signals as the 
huge craft came closer and closer. 

Lan Sur leaned forward slightly 
in his seat, a little strain showing on 
his usually relaxed face. To his sur- 
prise, he found himself saying aloud, 
“Yes, I think I can.” 

But he did not. Suddenly the 
enemy craft shot by above him and 
belched forth a thick burst of light. 
The huge black warships immedi- 
ately beneath him echoed the call, 
catching his smaller, fleeter ship in 
a double barrage. 

And it was all over. 

The red lights on the control 
panel blinked out quickly, one by 
one. The warning bells ceased their 
claxons, the computer settled down 
to a quiet hum. The screens went 
blank. A thin piece of tape spewed 
forth from the computer. It read, 
“This scout ship utterly annihilated. 
End of problem.” 

Lan Sur looked the tape over 
sourly. “Damn,” he said, leaning 
back in his seat. He tore the tape 
into little pieces and deposited them 
angrily in the reclaim box. Reluc- 
tantly he pressed the “Analysis” 
button on the computer. The ma- 
chine would issue him a complete 
dissection of the whole mock war 
game, pointing out with deadly ac- 
curacy the mistakes he had made. 


14 


JAMES MC CONNELL 



“Damn,” he said again, thinking 
over the past battle. He got up from 
die control panel and walked over 
to his relaxation chair. Sitting 
down, he took a small bit of food 
from a container and began chew- 
ing on it viciously. 

It wasn’t really so bad that he 
lost the engagement, he told him- 
self. The pre-battle odds were great- 
ly against him. And as often as he 
had tried it, he had never been able 
to take on seven enemy ships and 
still survive. Sometimes it seemed 
an almost impossible task to him. 
However, he had a deep desire to 
solve the problem, because the com- 
puter told him it might be solvable 
if he took the proper course of ac- 
tion. Evidently, it would take a lot 
more work, a great deal more study 
on his part before he found the 
solution. 

“But time is something I have 
plenty of,” he said aloud, stretch- 
ing out comfortably in the chair. 
For several hours he puzzled over 
the thing, taking time out to digest 
the taped analysis of his mistakes, 
and then attacked the problem 
afresh. Eventually, out of sheer ex- 
haustion, he slipped off into a deep, 
restful sleep, quite confident that 
the next time he tried the seven- 
ship problem, or at most the time 
following that. 

Lan Sur awoke to quietness. He 
stretched his lean, lithe legs, slowly, 
returning to normal awareness as he 
did so. Once he was completely 
awake, he sat down in front of the 
control panel again. A single amber 
light betuned from the board. While 
he had been asleep, the scout ship 

AVOIDANCE SITUATION 


had come out of its C 2 drive and 
had slowed to a stop. They had 
reached their immediate destina- 
tion, and since he was asleep, the 
computer had simply turned on the 
protective screens around the ship 
and had begun a survey of the sun 
system they had arrived at. 

He pressed a button on the com- 
puter and then leaned back to di- 
gest the information that the ma- 
chine began feeding him at once. 
The sun was of the A/34.79Lu 
type, just as had been forecast be- 
fore his voyage. It had three large 
inner planets and a tiny fourth 
much too far away from the solar 
furnace and much too small to be 
of any practical value. Lan Sur 
read the report carefully, noting 
with pleasure certain of the facts 
presented him. He was in the midst 
of an interesting section concerning 
the chemical composition of the at- 
mosphere on the second of the 
planets when a small bell on the 
computer rang and the machine be- 
came silent for just a second or two, 
then began pouring out material 
at a furious rate. 

Lan Sur, who had been yards of 
tape behind in his reading, dropped 
the atmosphere discussion and be- 
gan to read the new information 
being spewed forth. A frown crossed 
his face as he read the first 
few words, “Alien contact estab- 
lished. .” He hoped this new de- 
velopment would not take him 
away from his games for too long a 
time. 

The computer had detected the 
emanation of modulated energy 
waves coming from the second plan- 
et. Immediately it had withdrawn 

15 



its wide-flung detector beams and 
had concentrated fully upon the 
source of the waves. Lan Sur reset 
the computer so that only a very 
small part of the huge machine 
would carry on the routine work of 
new investigation, while the greater 
part would be put to work in an at- 
tempt to decode what was obvious- 
ly a language being broadcast in 
some obsolete manner. He noted 
with pride that the aliens, whoever 
they might be, had not at the mo- 
ment reached the point of develop- 
ment where C 2 communication was 
available to them, but were still 
limited to the raw speed of light for 
the transmission of messages, and 
hence, he felt sure, for the trans- 
mission of space ships too. This 
meant, he knew, that he had prob- 
ably stumbled onto a race of 
beings still new to the reaches of 
space who would be helpless in the 
face of even his own lightly armed 
scout ship. However, according to 
patrol instructions, he activated a 
switch that relayed all pertinent in- 
formation by means of a sealed C 2 
beam back to the nearest Dakn 
Patrol base, and put in a formal 
call for the presence of Patrol 
battleships. One way or another, 
they would be needed. 

It took the computer less than a 
day and a half, as Lan Sur figured 
time, to break the language of the 
aliens discovered on the second 
planet. The Surveyor spent this 
time working feverishly on a new 
idea he had for the solution of the 
seven-ship problem, and was quite 
upset when the computer finished 
its problem of decoding the new 


tongue before Lan Sur had worked 
out all the details of his latest at- 
tack on the mock war games. Re- 
luctantly he put himself into a 
light trance, during which the ma- 
chine taught him the new language. 
He did not actually learn to think in 
the new tongue, for that would 
have imposed limiting strictures on 
his mental processes. Rather, his 
mind was turned into a kind of 
translating factory. He had the free- 
dom to think in the terms and in 
the concepts that he was accus- 
tomed to, and his mind simply ex- 
pressed these thoughts as best it 
could in the newly-learned way of 
speaking. The computer had also 
arrived at an incredibly clear 
knowledge of the socio-politico-psy- 
chological structure of the new 
civilization, but aside from a brief 
glance at some of the more intri- 
guing points, Lan Sur ignored this 
information and simply relayed it 
along to the Galactic base where 
social scientists could pore over it in 
their own bemused leisure. For his 
tasks Lan Sur hardly felt that he 
needed it. 

Once Lan Sur had memorized 
the language, he put his scout ship 
under a screen of complete invisi- 
bility and landed it some few miles 
away from the space ship the aliens 
were using as their permanent base. 
He let the computer drink up what 
additional information it required 
to make sure both that the plane- 
tary conditions were suitable to his 
own particular chemical make-up, 
and that the aliens were indeed as 
impotent as his previous estimates 
had seemed to indicate. Once the 
computer gave him its blessing, he 


16 


JAMES MC CONNELL 



walked out into the bright plane- 
tary sunlight. 

SYCHOLOGIST J. L. Brous- 
sard sat up puzzled. “What do 
you mean, don’t put away my Lew- 
inian vector charts too soon? I may 
have a chance to use them on 
whom?” 

Captain Allen Hawkins simply 
stared straight ahead of him, his 
lips forming unanswerable ques- 
tions. Broussard took his cue from 
the man’s head and stared too. And 
then he understood. 

The alien, for from its dress alone 
it obviously was an alien, was still 
quite a distance away from them. 
It came walking towards them with 
a kind of protective sparkle about 
it — and even from that distance 
they could sense a feeling of power 
about the man. 

“Man?” Broussard caught him- 
self thinking. Yes, it did seem very 
much like a man — not only like a 
human, but like a masculine hu- 
man. But immediately Broussard 
told himself that this might not be 
the case. True, humanoid it was, 
but because it displayed a certain 
lack of the more obvious female 
sexual characteristics it did not fol- 
low that it was male, “Why, they 
could even have ten different sexes 
for all we know,” Broussard 
thought to himself. 

“I think it’s coming towards us” 
Hawkins said quietly. 

Broussard watched the alien 
move a few more yards and then 
agreed. 

Hawkins activated a small radio 
that he carried in one of his shirt 

AVOIDANCE SITUATION 

y 


pockets. “Hello, Communications,” 
he spoke rapidly into the micro- 
phone. “This is Hawkins. Put me 
through to the Bridge at once. And 
make sure you record every word 
that I say.” 

The words “Aye, aye, Captain,” 
were forthcoming immediately from 
the tiny loudspeaker. The Captain 
rated a special communications 
channel that was guarded by the 
radio shack at all times, and it came 
as no surprise to Hawkins that the 
reply was prompt He had ex- 
pected it to be. 

“Bridge here, go ahead.” 

“This is Captain Hawkins, 
Bridge. Who’s the Duty Officer?” 
Hawkins knew who the man was, 
but asked to give the man a chance 
to realize fully that the Captain 
was aware with whom he was 
speaking. 

“Lieutenant Medboe, Captain, 
ready for instructions.” 

Hawkins thought for just a mo- 
ment and then answered. “Mr. 
Medboe, the information that I am 
about to pass along to you is not to 
leave the Bridge under any circum- 
stances. As soon as I finish, you will 
contact the radio shack and make 
certain that what I have said, if it 
has been monitored, is not passed 
along from that particular point 
either. Do you understand me.” 

Medboe’s voice sounded a little 
puzzled, “Of course, Captain. Your 
instructions will be followed to the 
letter.” 

“Now then,” Hawkins continued. 
“You might as well know at once 
that I think we’ve made contact 
with an alien race. I don’t know 
what this means to you personally, 

17 




but to the human race it means a 
great deal and we can under no 
circumstances risk the occurrence 
of any incident. You will therefore 
send someone to find Commander 
Petri and inform him that as Exec- 
utive Officer, he will be in charge 
of the ship until I return to it. And 
while you are doing that, you will 
summon all the men to return to 
the ship at once. You may not give 
them the real reason — tell them 
that there is a bad storm coming 
and that I have ordered them all 
inside. It is imperative that none of 
them realizes the true reason. Do 
you understand?” 

Medboe’s voice sounded almost 
hurt. “Aye, aye, Captain,” he said. 

“Good. Once everyone is back 
inside the ship, have Petri summon 
all officers not on watch and all 
scientists to the large meeting hall. 
They will be given a chance to ob- 
serve and listen to the contact as it 
is made. Which reminds me — have 
the communications department set 
up a long range television camera 
on me at once, and pipe the image 
down into the hall. You will have 
them record both sight and sound 
for later use. You will also inform 
Petri that a state of emergency ex- 
ists as of this moment by my per- 
sonal order, and that if necessary 
he is to blast off from the planet 
without making any attempt either 
to protect or rescue me. And once 
it has been established that we are 
in fact dealing with an alien cul- 
ture, Navy Headquarters must be 
informed immediately via subspace 
radio.” Hawkins wanted to make 
sure that in the event the entire 
ship was captured, Earth would 


know that an alien contact had been 
made and could take steps to pro- 
tect itself. He only wished, now 
that he thought of it, that he could 
have taken more adequate steps to 
protect the men and the ship. But 
for the moment the Sunward and 
her crew would have to remain 
where they were and as they were. 
And if the alien had not attacked 
them up to that point, perhaps no 
attack would be made at all. 

Hawkins wanted to tell Medboe 
a thousand other things — simple, 
obvious things that surely both 
Medboe and Petri would be cog- 
nizant of. But, as always, the man 
who had to delegate responsibility 
simply had to depend on the per- 
spicacity of the men to whom he 
gave the power. 

“Any questions?” Hawkins asked 
after a brief pause. 

“I don’t believe so, Captain,” 
Medboe answered. Hawkins could 
tell from the sound of the man’s 
voice that he had hundreds of 
things he would have liked to ask, 
but none of them were of the type 
that he could have expected his 
superior officer to answer. 

“Good,” Hawkins replied for- 
mally. “One more thing. You will 
under no circumstances attempt to 
contact me on this radio set — 
there’s no need in letting the alien 
know any more about us or our 
abilities than we absolutely have 
to.” 

“Right, Captain,” came the obe- 
dient answer. 

Hawkins turned the switch to the 
“Sustained Talk” position and in- 
formed the Officer of the Deck of 
his actions. Then he turned to 


18 


JAMES MC CONNELL 



Broussard. “Anything you have to 
add to all that?” he asked. 

The psychologist indicated a neg- 
ative by a shake of his head. 

“Very well, Mr. Medboe. You 
may carry out your orders,” Haw- 
kins said with a sigh. Then he 
turned to Broussard again. “Well, 
Louie. I guess it’s up to you from 
here on out. You’re the alienist.” 
And with that, Hawkins reluctant- 
ly relinquished completely his nor- 
mal command of the situation. 

During the time that Captain 
Hawkins had been giving his or- 
ders, Broussard had been deep in 
thought, paying only scant atten- 
tion to die instructions that the 
other man had passed along. The 
psychologist’s mind had been racing 
over the possibilities of this first 
contact, and more than once dur- 
ing the brief period of time, it had 
dwelt on his own particular fears 
that he would not be up to the en- 
counter. 

“I think you had better give the 
radio to me,” Broussard said. “I’ll 
probably be closer to the alien dur- 
ing the first stages of contact at 
least, and certainly I should be 
doing most of the talking.” 

The statement made sense to 
Hawkins, and he passed the device 
over without comment. Broussard 
tucked it away in one of his pock- 
ets. 

“I don’t think we should bother 
walking towards him,” Broussard 
said a moment later, answering an 
unspoken question. “He’s obvious- 
ly coming toward us and it would 
seem better if we weren’t too 
eager.” Broussard felt no need to 


describe the alien over the radio 
since by this time the communica- 
tions division back on board the 
Sunward would have set up their 
long range television cameras. Cap- 
tain Hawkins shifted about on his 
feet a bit like a boxer doing warm- 
up footwork prior to a battle. 

“I wonder where he’s put his 
space ship,” Broussard said. 

Hawkins looked puzzled. “How 
do you know he’s got one?” he 
asked. 

“Well, it’s just a hunch. But un- 
less I miss my guess, that shining 
air the — the — ” Broussard groped 
for the right noun, then fell back 
again on a sheer perceptual anal- 
ysis. “The shining air the man 
coming towards us has is a defen- 
sive screen of some sort. And we’ve 
certainly found no evidence on 
Trellis of any civilization at all, 
much less one so advanced that it 
could dream up gadgets like that. 
I figure he must be from some- 
where else. Maybe he’s just a visi- 
tor here too, like u£.” Hawkins in- 
wardly admitted the logic of the 
reasoning. 

As the alien came closer, they 
could both see why they had in- 
stinctively felt from the first that it 
was of the male gender. The crea- 
ture’s hair was cut a little longer 
than men wore theirs back on 
Earth, but this was almost the only 
difference. The alien was a bit 
taller than either of them, but not 
beyond the limits produceable by 
the human race. His shoulders were 
the widest part of his body, and 
formed the broad top of the in- 
verted triangular shape that most 
human men admired. His clothes 


AVOIDANCE SITUATION 


19 



were of some peculiar, clinging 
material, but the bottom half of his 
body was fitted out in a close ap- 
proximation of Earthside trousers. 
The man was handsome even by 
their own standards of masculine 
beauty. 

“Well,” said Hawkins. “This is 
it. Man is no longer ‘alone. 5 ” 

Broussard realized suddenly that 
the other man was just as nervous 
as he himself was. “No, man is no 
longer alone,” Broussard replied. 
And then he added, “But neither 
is he” 

The alien was less than one hun- 
dred yards away when Broussard 
said quietly, “I don’t think we’d 
better talk any more. Let’s just 
stand here and wait for him to make 
the first move,” 

Lan Sur walked towards the two 
aliens at a comfortable rate of 
speed. When he was still some dis- 
tance off the computer back on his 
scout ship informed him of the first 
of the messages going back and 
forth from one of the men to the 
ship, and then of the gradual with- 
drawal of the rest of the ship’s 
crew to the sanctuary of the Sun- 
ward. It was with no surprise at all 
that he listened to the computer, as 
, it did a remote physical and chem- 
ical analysis of the aliens. Eons ago 
the Dakn people had come to the 
conclusion, first in theory and then 
in fact, that intelligent life capable 
of reaching the stars had to fall 
within the humanoid pattern. The 
aliens confronting him were well 
within the theoretical tolerance 
limits on every count. But still it 
amused him to see the slight obesi- 


ty of one of the men and the thick 
body hair of the other. These were 
two minor points of difference be- 
tween the races. 

At exactly the right psychological 
distance from the two aliens, Lan 
Sur stopped. He was quite close 
enough to be heard and understood, 
but not so close that his physical 
presence suggested too much of a 
threat. He waited just long enough 
before speaking. 

“It is customary in your culture 
to begin with introductions,” he 
said in a strong voice. “I am Lan 
Sur, possessed of the rank of Senior 
Surveyor in the Galactic Patrol of 
the Dakn Empire. I welcome you 
officially to the communion of the 
stars.”' 

Lan Sur could almost feel the 
sinking sensation inside the larger 
of the two aliens when he began to 
speak to them in their own tongue. 
It amused him to think that these 
two had probably expected to begin 
by drawing pictures in the dirt. 
Well, they would learn. 

“You should know at once that 
the Dakn Empire comprises some 
700 quadrillion people of the same 
general humanoid characteristics as 
obtain in your race. We populate 
planets on some hundred thousand 
suns, most of which lie much fur- 
ther toward the opposite end of 
the galaxy than does the system in 
which we find ourselves at the mo- 
ment. We have explored great 
reaches of the universe, but this is 
the first time we have penetrated 
as far into this particular district 
as this star you call Clarion. That 
explains why our races have never 
before come into contact.”

The two aliens leaned forward a 
little on their feet, as caught up in 
his words as children might be 
when told a new and fascinating 
story. 

“The Dakn Empire is the only 
other political system that exists in 
this entire galaxy, as far as we 
know.” Lan Sur paused for a mo- 
ment, to let the significance of his 
words sink in. “There have been 
others, of course, but they soon 
passed under our control. Just as 
your civilization will now pass un- 
der our control.” 

He read the sudden, stark fear 
that appeared in their eyes correct- 
ly without needing the affirming 
echo from the computer. 

“The Dakn Empire has learned 
that whenever it discovers a new 
civilization, it must absorb this new 
culture immediately. There is no 
other choice. And your race must 
follow the pattern of the thousands 
we have encountered in the past. 
There is no choice. As of this mo- 
ment, you and your people are, 
from our point of view, just as 
much a part of our Empire as our 
own home planets. This does not 
appeal to you, I know. But there is 
no other way.” 

The computer informed him that 
the Sunward had brought all of its 
gun turrets to bear on him, but Lan 
Sur ignored the fact as being ir- 
relevant. 

He continued. “No, you do not 
have a choice about becoming a 
part of our system. But you do have 
a choice about the method by 
which this action will be taken.” 
The involuntary sigh that one of 
the aliens gave briefly amused him. 


The alien would find that the sigh 
of relief was a short one. “The 
choice is this — either you will join 
with us peacefully, in which case 
the whole period of transition will 
take less than one of your years. 
Or . .” He let the word dangle 
momentarily before his booming 
voice continued. “Or, if you choose 
to oppose us, the transition time 
will take even less than that. We 
will simply destroy you and all of 
your worlds. 

“You have no alternatives.” 

The alien’s voice grew louder. 
“You will want to know what ab- 
sorption into our system will mean 
to you. By now you will surely have 
realized how far superior we are to 
you in every way, and I include 
specifically the factor of intelli- 
gence in this statement. My analysis 
of your potential intellectual and 
rational powers shows me that you 
are not capable of contesting on an 
equal basis with any of the other 
races that comprise our Empire. 
You are the lowest of the low, and 
as such, your race will be put into 
a slave category. We always have 
room for more slaves.” 

The two aliens in front of him 
seemed in a state of shock. Lan Sur 
felt he might as well finish the 
thing off and get it over with. 

“If you choose to come with us 
peacefully, what will happen is 
this: We will take over all of your 
worlds at once, evacuating your 
people from them in less than a 
month. Your race will be spread 
out over our Empire, sent to the 
places where they are needed the 
most. 

“Of course you will not be al- 

21 


AVOIDANCE SITUATION 



lowed to retain either your own 
personalities or your memories. As 
slaves you would scarcely need 
them. So they will be stripped from 
you en route to your new homes, 
and suitable new slave personalities 
will be implanted in your minds. 
You find this thought distasteful I 
know, but it is the only logical ac- 
tion we can take. You will be bom 
again, so to speak, knowing our 
language, feeling at home in our 
way of life and not retaining even 
a shred of your old patterns of cul- 
ture. This is the simplest, most ef- 
ficient way in which your race can 
become a part of our much larger 
scheme of things. 

“If you do not choose to come 
peacefully . .” again Lan Sur 
stopped for dramatic effect, “the 
warships I have already summoned, 
coming at the square of the speed 
of light, will search out every 
planet, every world in this whole 
sector, and will utterly annihilate 
every solar system you have con- 
taminated. We have, in the past, 
met obstinate races who tried to re- 
sist our rule. The results were 
rather spectacular from an astro- 
nomical point of view. Perhaps 
your scientists have wondered what 
caused the nova of stars, or even 
the explosions of whole regions of 
space. Now you have the answer. 
We would hate to destroy your 
race, but if you resist us, we have 
no choice.” 

A strange, intense smile came 
over Lan Sur’s face. “Our history 
relates of one race that tried to 
avoid its destiny. These peoples 
scattered to the four winds in mil- 
lions of ships in their attempt to 


hide from us.” Fire lighted the 
alien’s eyes. “It took more than a 
thousand of your years to track 
them all down, and we covered 
more than half the galaxy in doing 
so. It was a glorious thing. Now 
they are dead. All of them.” 

Slowly the smile died away. Lan 
Sur looked back at the two Earth- 
lings before him. “You will see the 
necessity for all of this when you 
have exhausted your emotional re- 
actions to this information and are 
capable of thinking logically again. 
In the long run it matters little to 
any of us which action we are 
forced to take. But because I realize 
that a race as untutored as yours 
is, cannot be expected to control its 
emotions in such a situation, I will 
not demand an immediate answer 
from you. I will give you more than 
ample time in which to think the 
problem through. 

“You have exactly twenty-four 
hours in which to make up your 
minds.” 


I N HIS younger days at the 
Academy, Captain Allen Haw- 
kins had been a boxer, and a good 
one. Most of his fights he had won 
easily and decisively. The few that 
he lost had been close matches and 
split decisions. Then had come the 
day when he had persuaded himself 
to fight outside his own weight and 
experience classifications, and he 
had matched himself against a 
classmate much larger than him- 
self. Hawkins still remembered that 
fight at times. After the first round 
he had been completely dazed, 
scarcely conscious of his surround- 


22 


JAMES MC CONNELL 




ings. Again and again he found 
himself lying stretched out on the 
canvas and had to force himself 
back to his feet to re-enter the fray. 
The fight terminated rather sud- 
denly in the third round when 
Hawkins went down to the canvas 
for a full count. 

All of this had happened years 
before, but the emotions that 
gripped the man now, as he stood 
facing the incredible alien from 
the center of the galaxy — these 
emotions reminded him of that 
fight. He felt now as he had felt 
when he regained consciousness in 
the dressing room — a little out of 
his senses, the wind still knocked 
out of him, and emotionally com- 
pletely stunned. 


AVOIDANCE SITUATION 


23 





The fact that Lan Sur had 
spoken perfect English had been 
the first blow. Every sentence that 
the alien had spoken was like a 
sharp jab, a sudden punch to a 
vital area. As in his boxing days, 
after a few brief moments of listen- 
ing, Hawkins had stopped thinking 
with his brain — and had begun 
thinking with his stomach. But he 
was completely open and un- 
guarded for the Sunday punch. 

“You have exactly twenty-four 
hours in which to make up your 
minds.” 

The three men stood facing each 
other for at least a full minute, 
none of them speaking. Broussard 
recovered his voice before Hawkins 
could and said feebly, “You can’t 
mean it.” 

Lan Sur’s face gave no* expres- 
sion of emotion. “I realized that 
you would be incapable of compre- 
hending what I have said so soon 
after I had said it. This is why I am 
giving you a length of time in 
which to make your decision. But 
you might as well realize that this 
high emotional index rating of your 
race is one of the main reasons you 
rate so low. It is a trait that we will 
have to breed out of your race.” 

Hawkins came to life suddenly, 
reacting violently, his emotional 
control shattered. He almost 
shouted at the alien, “If we’re in 
such bad shape, why can’t you just 
go off and leave us alone? You’ve 
got all the rest of the universe. Why 
can’t you just leave us alone in our 
little corner of it?” 

“If you were not so emotionally 
aroused at the moment, you would 

24 


understand why we cannot ‘leave 
you alone,’ as you put it,” the alien 
told him calmly. “It is completely 
impossible for two differing cul- 
tures to exist in this galaxy, as large 
as it is. Eventually the two cultures 
would have to come into contact, 
and this would cause friction. We 
do not care for friction, and we al- 
ways seek to avoid it. By forcing 
you to join us now — or by destroy- 
ing you if you refuse — we make ab- 
solutely sure that your race will 
never be the cause of any friction to 
us in the future.” 

“Friction?” asked Broussard 
slowly. 

“If we allowed you to go your 
own way, your population would 
expand and you would be forced 
to take over more and more of this 
area of the universe. We have our 
own plans for this part of the 
galaxy which do not include fight- 
ing constant wars with you for the 
possession of each new planetary 
system that one of us sees fit to 
colonize.” The alien spoke to them 
as he might have spoken to chil- 
dren. 

Hawkins refused to abandon the 
train of thought. “But we could 
promise to give up all our worlds 
except our own home planet. You 
could have all the rest.” 

Lan Sur shook his head. “At the 
present moment, you will promise 
anything to rid yourself of the pain- 
ful necessity of making the decision 
that I have demanded of you. You 
might even be quite willing to live 
up to your promise of retiring to 
your home planet, never to voyage 
forth again. But your children and 
their children would grow discon- 


JAMES MC CONNELL 



tent and restless. Eventually, either 
a hundred or a thousand or a hun- 
dred thousand years from now, you 
would come forth to challenge us 
again.” Lan Sur’s face grew a trifle 
grim. “And next time you would 
be better equipped and stronger. 
You would be able to put up a 
better fight than you can at the 
moment.” Then he smiled. “Oh, of 
course, the Dakn Empire would 
win eventually. We always do. But 
we would be back at exactly the 
same point that we are at right 
now. We would be forced to absorb 
you into our Empire, or to destroy 
you utterly. And, in the meantime, 
we would, of necessity, be forced to 
keep a careful watch on everything 
you did.” 

He shook his head. “No, you 
must realize that we cannot tolerate 
anything but absolute surrender. 
You have my terms. You must 
make your decision. There is noth- 
ing more to say.” 

Hawkins felt the numbing hand 
of deep fear within him. Like a los- 
ing boxer, he fought for any advan- 
tage that he might be able to take. 
“But, good Lord, man” he said 
quickly. “You don’t understand the 
situation at all. Twenty-four hours 
isn’t nearly enough time to make a 
decision that will affect our entire 
population. We can’t even inform 
our home base of what’s going on 
in that length of time, much less 
get a message back from them. 
And this is the sort of thing that 
would have to be submitted to our 
population as a whole, for them to 
decide. We’re just a very, very 
small part of our race. Why, we . 
we don’t have the authority to 

AVOIDANCE SITUATION 


make a decision that would affect 
the people back home. You must 
give us more time.” 

“Your complete lack of insight 
amazes me, even though I expected 
it,” the alien said. “Surely you must 
understand that the more time I 
give you, the more time you have 
to prepare your physical defenses. 
I am just as aware as you are that, 
lacking the C 2 communications 
methods, it is impossible for you 
to contact your home planet in 
the time that I have allowed you. 
But the war ships that I have al- 
ready summoned will be here short- 
ly, and even before they arrive, 
there is much that I must do to 
ready you and your people for the 
change if you decide to come with 
us. If you do not decide to come 
with us, then I must begin the 
search for your home planet, so 
that it may be destroyed. In either 
event, the sooner your choice is 
made, the better it is for me. Al- 
ready I have allowed you more 
time than is actually necessary for 
you to overcome your emotion and 
to think the problem through log- 
ically.” 

“But I simply haven’t got the 
authority to make such a choice!” 
Hawkins found himself shouting. 
“Can’t you understand that?” 

Lan Sur paused a moment to let 
the other man regain some of his 
composure. Then he said simply 
but firmly, “I am in control here 
now. I have the authority, and I 
delegate it to you. You must decide 
for everyone.” 

Broussard’s reactions were per- 
haps a little less emotionally tinged 
than might have been thought from 

25 



his facial reactions. He had held 
back what he felt to be a highly 
pertinent question until he felt that 
the alien was preparing to conclude 
the interview. He asked it now. 
“You seem to know a great many 
things about us, Lan Sur. And we 
seem to know very little about you. 
In a sense, this is strong evidence 
of your race’s superiority. And yet 
you cannot really expect us to ca- 
pitulate our entire culture to yours 
without giving us very conclusive 
proof that you are able to carry out 
your threats. After all, we are a 
large ship full of fighting men, and 
you seem to be one man all by 
yourself. What is to keep us from 
. .” Deliberately the psychologist 
let the question hang uncompleted. 

Lan Sur smiled. “At least you 
respond in a semi-logical fashion. 
The point is well taken, and if you 
had not brought it up now, I would 
have had to do so myself at a later 
time. I am therefore prepared to 
demonstrate to you the strength of 
our technology. You two will re- 
turn to your ship, and I will remain 
here. You will then, for the next 
two hours, have the opportunity to 
attack me by any means you see 
fit. I will simply defend myself, 
without endangering you or your 
ship in any fashion. When you have 
discovered that even as undefended 
as I appear to be at the moment, 
all of your weapons are powerless 
to harm me, perhaps you will un- 
derstand that I can carry out my 
threats if I so choose to.” 

The alien gestured with his hand. 
“And now, you must return to your 
ship. During the two hours at 
which I place myself at your mercy, 


you may naturally maneuver your 
vessel as you desire. But at the end 
of the two hours, you must have re- 
turned to your landing place here 
— or to whatever other spot on this 
planet that I may choose to indi- 
cate to you by radio. Any attempt 
on your part to escape either now, 
or during the period following, or 
any attack you attempt on me ex- 
cept during these first two hours, or 
any effort to summon additional 
help, will mean the instant destruc- 
tion of your ship — and of your race. 
I hope that you will both under- 
stand what I have said and will be- 
lieve that I have the power to 
achieve my ends.” 

Surveyor Lan Sur crossed his 
arms. “This interview is at an end.” 

After a few seconds of stunned 
silence, the two men turned and 
walked the long and lonesome way 
back to the Sunward . 

All of the scientists aboard the 
Sunward and most of the ship’s of- 
ficers were assembled in the central 
meeting hall when Broussard and 
Hawkins arrived. Hawkins walked 
directly to the central podium and 
turned to face the group. 

“Gentlemen,” he began slowly, 
his features a mask of repressed 
emotion. “I know that I do not 
have to give you any fuller ex- 
planations than you have already 
received. We have been given a 
challenge that seems to be insolu- 
ble. But we must face the situation, 
as the alien Lan Sur has suggested, 
with a minimum of emotionality 
and with a maximum of good, hard 
logic. I would welcome any com- 
ments, suggestions you might have 


26 


JAMES MC CONNELL 



to offer.” 

There was a general shuffling of 
feet and clearing of throats among 
the crowd. It seemed to Hawkins as 
if each member present was wait- 
ing for someone else to speak first. 
Finally the Communications Of- 
ficer broke the silence. 

“Captain, it has occurred to me 
that if the alien’s powers are as 
great as he claims, he may well be 
able to monitor every word any of 
us speaks, even here. I think we 
must take that into consideration.” 

The crowd murmured an assent, 
feeling, Hawkins was sure, that it 
gave them an excellent excuse for 
not being able to propose any solu- 
tion to the problem. “I think you 
are quite right,” Hawkins an- 
swered. “However, I feel that for 
the moment we must operate as if 
he couldn’t monitor us. In the 
meantime, the communications de- 
partment must take what precau- 
tions it can to assure us that our 
future conversations are held in 
complete privacy.” A touch of bit- 
ter defeat crept into his voice. “And 
I would imagine that even if he is 
listening right now, he’ll gain pre- 
cious little in the way of useful in- 
formation.” 

The group shuffled its feet again, 
embarrassed at its own impotence. 
“Are there any further comments?” 
Hawkins asked. There seemed to be 
none, until the Gunnery Officer 
spoke up. 

“Captain,” he said, a slight smile 
on his broad face. “I’d sort of like 
to see just how much punishment 
the bastard can take.” 

Hawkins laughed, breaking the 
tension. “I think we all agree with 


you. Suppose we put off any fur- 
ther discussion until after we’ve put 
the alien through his paces. It will 
give us an opportunity to test his 
strength — and to test our own. 

“Many of you — •” Hawkins indi- 
cated with a wave of his hand the 
officers in the room “ — are familiar 
with the offensive strength of this 
vessel. She is one of the most pow- 
erfully armed ships that Earth has. 
What I intend to do, then, is this: 
We’ll give our friend out there just 
as much hell as the Sunward can 
dish out. But while we’re doing it, 
I want photographs of every at- 
tack we make, fast photos that will 
give us, perhaps, an inkling of how 
he overcomes all of our weapons, if 
he does. I think this is extremely 
important.” He looked the crowd 
over. “We’ll begin the attack just 
as soon as all of you have indicated 
to me that your departments are 
ready. That is all, gentlemen.” 

Half an hour later the Sunward 
rose from her landing site and 
floated gently into the atmosphere. 
She came to a halt about ten thou- 
sand feet up and drifted into an 
optimum firing position. Every gun 
and camera the ship possessed was 
trained on the now scarcely visible 
figure of the alien almost two miles 
beneath her. Hawkins was on the 
battle bridge, his experienced hand 
controlling the ship firmly, belying 
the nervousness he felt. 

“Gunnery all ready, Sir!” came 
the report. 

“Fire!” shouted Hawkins a little 
louder than he meant to. He 
strained forward in his seat to 
watch the scene on the screen in 


AVOIDANCE SITUATION 


27 



front of him. 

The heat guns opened up first. In 
less than a second the area of maxi- 
mum temperature was less than 
two feet away from the alien’s 
body. A space of ground 300 yards 
in diameter suddenly went up in 
smoke at the intensity of the rays. 
Slim shreds of fire licked at the 
edge of the ring, and in the center 
all was fierce flame and smoke as 
the heat actually melted the earth. 
For a full five minutes the guns re- 
mained firing at maximum inten- 
sity. No organic substance known to 
man could withstand such violence. 

“Cease firing,” Hawkins called. 
He leaned back slowly in his chair. 
It would take a few minutes for the 
smoke to clear, but he knew in his 
heart what they would see once it 
had. And even before the wind had 
blown enough of the smoke away 
to make things visible, they saw the 
figure of the alien come walking 
briskly out of the hellish ring of 
destruction and wave his arm to 
them. 

“God,” said Hawkins quietly. 
After a moment he threw open a 
communications switch that con- 
nected him to the Gunnery Officer. 
“Well, what’s next?” he asked 
quietly. 

Next came a huge ball of elec- 
tricity that spat sparks as it hurtled 
through space and shattered itself 
into a million bolts of lightning at 
the very feet of the alien. The re- 
sulting burst of light was painful to 
the eyes, but when vision cleared, 
they saw the alien again, still stand- 
ing erect and still waving. 

They tried launching a dozen 
space torpedoes at once, filled with 


the highest chemical explosives 
known to man. They crashed in 
criss-cross fashion about the alien, 
ripping the very air asunder with 
their fantastic devastation. They 
left a crater almost a mile wide, 
and standing in the middle of it, 
still untouched, the enemy. Then 
the ship bombarded the small fig- 
ure below with every wavelength 
known to man, still without effect. 

Finally the Gunnery Officer 
called Hawkins on the intercom. 
“I’m sorry, Captain, but we did 
our best. I guess there’s only one 
thing left to do.” 

“I guess you’re right,” Hawkins 
admitted reluctantly. And turning 

to his helmsman he said, “Take her 

>> 

up. 

The Sunward was almost fifty 
miles from the alien when she un- 
leashed her final weapon. She had 
dropped tattle-tale robots behind 
to feed her information both before 
and after the blast. And then she 
aimed the mightiest atomic weapon 
man had created straight at Lan 
Sur. 

The very planet shook at its 
detonation, so powerful was the 
bomb. The fire and clouds rose 
miles into the sky, and the Sun- 
ward’s delicate instruments indi- 
cated the presence of a radiation so 
intense that it was certain an area 
hundreds of miles in size was com- 
pletely destroyed. It took several 
minutes before enough of the after- 
math of the explosion had cleared 
away for them to find him, but they 
located the alien sitting calmly in a 
crater at the very center of the af- 
fected area, obviously still un- 
harmed.

JAMES MC CONNELL 



Hawkins contemplated the sit- 
uation for several minutes, and 
then wearily stretched out his hand 
and turned on the radio. After a 
moment he said simply, “All right, 
Lan Sur, you win. Where do you 
want us to land?” 

Lan Sur answered immediately. 
“You will place your vessel in an 
area almost directly beneath your 
present position which I have 
caused to be marked in red. Any 
attempt to move the vessel without 
my permission will result in your 
immediate destruction. If, during 
the waiting time, you have any fur- 
ther questions to ask of me, I will 
be available. However, if you have 
not come to any conclusion by the 
end of that time, I shall be forced 
to destroy you without further hesi- 
tation. You have exactly twenty- 
two hours and nine minutes left.” 

When the ship had landed, 
Hawkins returned to the confer- 
ence room. Most of the executive 
personnel were there, although 
some of the scientists were absent, 
ostensibly still analyzing the results 
of the futile attack on the alien. 
Hawkins strode briskly to the podi- 
um and faced the group. 

“Gentlemen,” he said, “you saw 
what happened. Perhaps some of 
you refused to believe that the alien 
could enforce his demands on us — 
and I’m sure that all of us hoped 
that this would be the case. But 
now we must accept the fact that 
the choice we were told to make 
will have to be made, unless we can 
come up with some means of de- 
stroying this creature or of escap- 
ing his wrath. 


“I want you to know that al- 
though it might well be within my 
province as Captain of the Sun- 
ward to decide which of the alter- 
natives we will take, I will not do 
so. What is decided here will affect 
all of Earth’s peoples everywhere. 
Neither one man nor one small 
group can make this choice. There- 
fore, exactly one hour before the 
deadline, we will hold a plebiscite. 
Every person aboard the Sunward 
will have exactly one vote, and the 
majority decision will hold. I will 
refrain from voting and will decide 
the issue in the event of a tie. 

In the meantime, I want you to 
think. To think not only of a means 
of escape from our dilemma, if this 
be possible, but also how you will 
vote. If any of you have any ideas, 
or if you simply wish to talk about 
something, you will find me avail- 
able at any hour. 

“I do not know how each of you 
will react to this situation. Perhaps 
the alien is right. Perhaps man is 
far too emotional an animal to 
merit more than slave status in the 
councils of the stars. But I hope 
that our actions will prove other- 
wise — and that this, man’s darkest 
hour, will also become his finest.” 

Hawkins turned from the group 
and walked quietly from the room. 
He knew that his speech had been 
anything but an example of clear 
logic devoid of emotional context, 
and he had no idea why he had let 
himself be so carried away. But 
with the inborn and well-trained 
sense he had of men and situations, 
he knew that he could not have 
spoken otherwise. 


AVOIDANCE SITUATION 


29 



The men on board the Sunward 
faced the crisis in various fashions. 
A few of the scientists worked with 
erratic bursts of speed to finish up 
their analyses of the data they had 
gathered during the bombardment 
of the alien. Some of the crew 
wrote letters home. The communi- 
cations department was swamped 
with personal messages to be re- 
layed back to Earth. The Chaplain 
gave up his attempt at private 
counseling and held hourly open 
services. The routine jobs were still 
performed, albeit in a perfunctory 
manner. But mostly the men just 
gathered around in small groups 
and talked, usually in low voices. A 
few of the luckier ones got drunk. 

Captain Hawkins remained in 
his room, completely isolated from 
the rest of the ship, for almost four 
hours. During that time he simply 
sat in his easy chair and thought. 
At the beginning of the fifth hour 
he broke a precedent and opened a 
bottle of whiskey. At the beginning 
of the sixth hour he broke still an- 
other precedent and sent for Brous- 
sard. Hawkins was neither too 
drunk nor too sober when the psy- 
chologist arrived. He told the scien- 
tist to sit down and offered him a 
drink. 

“I know it’s unethical for me to 
take you away from the men when 
they need your help more than ever 
before,” Hawkins began slowly, 
choosing to stare moodily at the 
table instead of directly at the man 
he was talking to. “But for once I 
am exercising a Captain’s peroga- 
tives. 

“You must have realized some 
of the problems that face anyone 

30 


in a position of command. Usually 
we have to operate on pretty rigid 
rules, but things always go better if 
it seems as though we aren’t quite 
as rigid as we really must be. The 
men under you always feel better if 
they think they have some free 
choice about things. In any mili- 
tary set-up you can’t allow much of 
this free will at all. The best com- 
mander is the one who decides 
what it is his men must do in a 
given situation, and then finds 
some way of making the men want 
to do it.” Again he paused, then 
looked up, facing Broussard square- 

ly- 

“I have decided what the result 
of the balloting must be — and I 
want you, as a psychologist, to help 
me make sure that I get that result 
without anyone else being aware 
that we’ve rigged things.” He got 
up from the table and began nerv- 
ously pacing the floor. 

After a few moments he stopped 
and turned to face the psychologist, 
both his fists clenched tightly on 
the back of his easy chair. He said 
nothing. 

After several moments of silence, 
Broussard cleared his throat and 
asked, “And which choice have you 
decided it must be?” 

Hawkins collapsed into the chair. 
Finally his mouth opened, his lips 
trembled, and he said, “Slavery, of 
course. It’s the only choice. 

“You’re the psychologist, per- 
haps you can understand the fierce 
pride I’d take in knowing that the 
men would have the . the guts 
to want to end it all instead of bow- 
ing down to that bastard out there 
who holds us in the very palm of his 


JAMES MC CONNELL 



hands.” Hawkins paused in this 
outburst, blinked his eyes briefly, 
and then continued. 

“But that’s just the emotion 
showing through. From the logical 
point of view, our race must con- 
tinue. If we choose slavery we’ll 
live and breathe and die just as we 
always have. We’ll do all of these 
things on alien planets, having for- 
gotten the Earth we sprang from 
and all our past history, as sorry as 
some of that has been. We’ll have 
forgotten who we are. We will have 
lost ourselves.” 

He banged a fist down on the 
table. “But we will exist! The pro- 
tection of the race comes first, and 
we’ve got to make sure that it is 
protected, that the Sunward makes 
the logical decision. I’ll steer things 
as best I can, but I’ll need help.” 

He turned to Broussard. “I’m not 
a psychologist. I won’t tell you how 
to go about it. I don’t care what 
you do. All I want are the results.” 

For a space of several seconds 
the two men sat without speaking. 
Then Hawkins said, “And I guess 
that unless you have something to 
add, that’s all for now. Let me 
know what you’re doing, if you 
have time to tell me. But more im- 
portant than that, let me know if 
you think you’re going to fail. We 
may have to rig the ballots if you 
do.” 

Broussard gave a deep sigh and 
rose to leave. He could understand 
the torment the Captain was going 
through, but there was little that he 
could do for the man at the mo- 
ment. He was almost at the door 
when Hawkins stopped him. 

“Broussard!” Hawkins shouted. 


“What in God’s name makes a 
man’s personality so dear to him? 
Why has it always been just about 
the last thing that a man will give 
up? You’re the psychologist. You 
must know the answer. Even a man 
with a diseased mind who knows 
that he’s sick and wants help badly 
will fight back tooth and nail when 
you try to change even one small 
part of his personality make-up. 
Didn’t you once tell me that? 
Didn’t you?” 

The Captain’s voice grew louder 
and louder. “That’s why therapy is 
so hard, isn’t it? That’s why con- 
structive education is so difficult, 
isn’t it? That’s why politicians who 
appeal to existing fears and hates 
and loves get elected instead of 
those men who try to shift public 
opinion for the better. 

“Oh, why in God’s name are we 
so proud of this tiny, puny, weak, 
insignificant, miserable thing inside 
each of us we call the real me!” He 
picked up the whiskey bottle and 
hurled it with full force against the 
wall. It shattered in a thousand 
pieces. The dark liquor inside ran 
down the wall leaving long thin 
fingers of stain behind it. 

Captain Hawkins’ personal stew- 
ard came rushing into the room at 
the sound of the crash, and looked, 
horrified, at the mess on the wall. 

“Oh, get out! Get out, both of 
you, and leave me alone!” Hawkins 
shouted. 

After they were gone, Hawkins 
threw himself on his bunk and 
buried his face in his pillow. The 
mood of fierce hot anger passed 
rapidly, leaving only the warm sting 


AVOIDANCE SITUATION 


31 



of shame. Although he had made 
the decision to capitulate to the 
alien, at least at an intellectual 
level, he could not really bring him- 
self to believe that there was no 
means of escape. His head ached 
from his emotional outburst and 
every effort toward constructive 
thinking seemed to end in a blind 
alley. He had been tossing restlessly 
for perhaps two hours when the 
Communications Officer brought 
him a message from Earth that 
had just been received. Hawkins 
reached for the message blank ear 
gerly at first, his befuddled mind 
thinking for just an instant that 
here were instructions from home 
telling him how to meet the crisis, 
telling him of a means of escape, or 
just taking the awful responsibility 
of the decision from him. But then 
he remembered that communica- 
tions, even when they passed 
through subspace, took several days 
to get from Earth to here. Earth 
was still unaware of the crisis on 
Trellis, and this message that had 
just been received had begun its 
journey long before they were made 
so painfully aware of the existence 
of the alien. 

The radiogram was of a semi- 
routine nature, but one that, in 
normal circumstances, would have 
demanded an immediate answer. 
“Shall we bother replying to it?” 
the Communications Officer asked. 

“Of course not,” Hawkins said 
angrily. “It wouldn’t be necessary, 
even if we dared break radio silence 
to reply.” 

The Communications Officer’s 
eyes opened wide in a startled fash- 
ion. “Radio silence?” he said fee- 


bly. “But, Captain, we’ve . 
we’ve . .” 

Hawkins sat bolt upright in his 
bunk. “Good Lord, man, do you 
mean to say that you’ve been send- 
ing messages to Earth right along?” 

The Communications Officer 
nodded. “We started relaying from 
the moment you contacted the 
alien. We’ve sent out all the talks, 
speeches, reports, everything. Just 
as you ordered.” The man was 
cringing in fright. 

“But didn’t you hear the alien 
tell us to make no attempt to con- 
tact our home base or he’d destroy 
us at once?” Hawkins demanded. 

The other officer felt like crawl- 
ing out of the room without bother- 
ing to open the door. “I’m sorry, 
Captain,” he managed to stutter. 
“But I must have missed that . 
that part of what he said. I ... I 
was called out of the office during 
part of the contact when something 
went wrong with one of our main 
transmitters.” The man had turned 
a very pale shade of white. “But I’ll 
stop transmission at once,” he said, 
turning nervously towards the door. 

Hawkins looked at his watch. “If 
he hasn’t blasted us for it by now, I 
don’t guess he ever will. But all die 
same, you’d better stop sending im- 
mediately.” As the Communica- 
tions Officer left the room, Haw- 
kins cursed mildly under his breath. 
After all of his plans and sweat 
and pains, it would take something 
like this to bring the whole house of 
cards crashing about him, some lit- 
tle insignificant something that he 
had overlooked. “For want of a 
nail . .’’he said aloud, reminding 
himself of the age-old parable. 


32 


JAMES MC CONNELL 



“But if he meant what he said 
about not notifying Earth, why 
hasn’t he already destroyed us?” 
Hawkins asked himself. Perhaps 
Lan Sur wasn’t as cruelly logical 
and unfeeling as they had thought. 
Hawkins pushed the thought from 
his mind, knowing that it would 
lead him to too much false hope 
if he pursued it further. It would 
be too easy to hope that simply be- 
cause Lan Sur had not acted upon 
one of his threats, he might not act 
on the rest of them. 

As he thought, Hawkins found 
himself pacing the floor of his room 
anxiously — first to one wall, then a 
stop, an about face, and back to the 
opposite side of the room. He 
stopped his walking and slumped 
down into his chair. 

“Back and forth,” he said out 
loud. “From one side to another. 
I’m just like the child in Brous- 
sard’s story. Only instead of a man 
with a stick at one end of the hall 
and a dog at the other, I’ve got Lan 
Sur at both ends. Death, or a kind 
of slavery which is just about as 
bad. A real ‘avoidance situation’ if 
ever one existed.” He laughed bit- 
terly. “The closer I come to one 
choice, the worse it seems and the 
better the other choice appears.” 

He shrugged his shoulders sadly. 
“But eventually I’ll have to realize 
that there’s no escape. Unfortu- 
nately, unlike the child in Brous- 
sard’s example, I can’t . , .” 

Hawkins stopped suddenly as 
something occurred to him. “Good 
God,” he said after a moment. He 
sat upright in the chair. “It 
couldn’t be. It just couldn’t” he 
told himself. “And yet, I bet, I bet 


it isl” 

He got up from the chair and 
walked quickly to the wall com- 
municator. “Hello, Bridge?” he de- 
manded. “Inform all officers not 
on watch and all the scientific per- 
sonnel that I want to see them in 
the council chamber in thirty min- 
utes. Exactly thirty minutes, do you 
understand?” 

There was a broad smile on his 
face as he marched out of his state- 
room to talk with some of the of- 
ficers and scientists before the meet- 
ing. 

After all of the men had crowded 
into the meeting hall, they closed 
and locked the doors. The group 
kept up a low but excited chatter 
while they waited for Captain 
Hawkins to begin. 

“Gentlemen,” he said finally, 
calling the meeting to order. “I am 
informed by the electronics special- 
ists aboard that they have made 
this meeting room as ‘spy-proof’ as 
is humanly possible, but I think 
we’ve learned not to trust the 
power of human technology too 
much these past few hours. There- 
fore, I’m going to tell you just as 
little of my plans as I po&ibly can, 
on the theory that the best-kept 
secret is the one that the fewest 
people know about.” 

The crowd seemed anxious, and 
a little apprehensive, but still hope- 
ful. 

“Within the past hour, I have 
made what I think are several re- 
markable discoveries. I shall not tell 
you what they are, but I think I 
have discovered a way out of the 
dilemma that we are facing,” 


AVOIDANCE SITUATION 


33 



The crowd breathed a unani- 
mous sigh of relief. Smiles broke 
out on several faces. 

“I cannot tell you just at the 
moment what this mode of escape 
is. But I have discussed it with a 
few of you — the fewest number 
possible — and all of them agree 
that there is an excellent chance 
that it will work. If it does, we of 
Earth will still face a great many 
problems. But we shall, at least, be 
free, and that is the important 
thing. If we fail . .” Hawkins let 
his voice trail off for a moment. “If 
we fail, we can expect instant de- 
struction not only for us, but for all 
of mankind.” 

He waited for the meaning to 
sink in, his face set in a firm frown. 
And then, purposefully, he let his 
facial muscles relax into a broad 
smile. “But I do not think that we 
will fail. I think we will win. And I 
have come to ask your permission 
to risk all our lives on the venture. 
I cannot give you any more in- 
formation I can only ask for your 
confidence — and for your votes of 
approval.” He looked around the 
room deliberately, pausing for just 
the right length of time. And then 
he said, “Will all of you who have 
sufficient faith in me and my judg- 
ment please rise in assent?” 

Broussard had given him the 
trick of mass decision — had told 
him that if you make people com- 
mit themselves openly, the decision 
has a better chance of unanimity. 
Hawkins smiled to see how well the 
device worked. Every man in the 
room was on his feet, most of them 
cheering. 

He waited for the shouting to die 


down and then said simply, “Thank 
you. And now to battle stations.” 


C APTAIN ALLEN HAWKINS 
sat in his control seat on the 
Sunward’s bridge, staring at the 
button that turned on his radio set. 
“The purpose of a position of re- 
sponsibility is to make decisions,” 
he told himself. 

A green light burst into life on 
the control panel, indicating that 
all of the preparations he had asked 
for were in readiness. Such signals 
would be his only means of com- 
munications during the entire ma- 
neuver, for he had given orders that 
no one was to utter one word aloud 
during the entire operation. He 
was taking no chances. 

Hawkins grinned. “And the devil 
take the hindmost,” he told himself. 

Pressing down on the radio but- 
ton, he said aloud, “This is Captain 
Allen Hawkins of the Sunward call- 
ing Surveyor Lan Sur of the Dakn 
Empire.” 

Almost at once he heard a voice 
answering, “You may go ahead.” 
“I think we have finally reached 
our decision,” Hawkins said sober- 
ly. “But before we announce it, we 
have one request to make, and I do 
not think you will find it an un- 
reasonable one. As you yourself 
pointed out, ours is an incredibly 
emotional race. Had we not been 
so, we could have given you our 
answer much sooner.” 

The alien’s voice came booming 
into the control room. “I will listen 
to your request, but you surely real- 
ize that none of the terms that I 
have given you can be changed.” 


34 


JAMES MC CONNELL 



“Yes, we realize that, and our 
request is along slightly different 
lines,” said Hawkins. “As I said, we* 
are an emotion-ridden race. But 
you must have realized that we 
aboard the Sunward are probably 
much more stable than are the ma- 
jority of our peoples back on our 
home planets. It is always so with 
explorers and scientists. Therefore, 
we were able to reach a logical de- 
cision, and we will be able to hold 
to it. 

“Unfortunately, we anticipate a 
little more trouble than this with 
‘the folks back home/ if you under- 
stand that term. And to make 
things much easier, not only for us, 
but also for you, we have a request 
to make.” 

“I understand the semantic im- 
port of the term and will give you 
my decision on the request if you 
will but come to the point,” came 
the alien’s voice. “We are wasting 
valuable time, and I have other 
things to do.” 

Hawkins was beginning to sweat 
a little. He was purposefully nee- 
dling the alien, and he had no idea 
of how far he dared to go. 

“Well, we of the Sunward are 
convinced that you can carry out 
your threats if we attempt any re- 
bellion. We have seen you stand un- 
touched by all the power this ship 
could muster. But defense against 
our meager weapons is one thing. 
The ability to destroy a star is an- 
other . 

“The folks back home would ac- 
cept our decision without hesita- 
tion, and would never dream of 
giving you or your people any trou- 
ble, if we could show them authen- 


tic pictures of how powerful you 
are offensively. We request, there- 
fore, that you unleash your weap- 
ons and turn this entire solar sys- 
tem into a nova while we photo- 
graph the procedure.” 

Lan Sur’s answering voice 
sounded frighteningly loud to 
Hawkins. “What you request is im- 
possible for several reasons. First, 
the Dakn Empire has no desire to 
destroy potentially valuable prop- 
erty simply to demonstrate its pow- 
ers. Second, the procedure would 
occupy too much time, for while 
my small ship could outrace the 
enveloping flames of the nova, your 
larger ship, unequipped as it is with 
the C 2 drive, would be caught in 
the destruction and you would 
perish. I recognize that from the 
emotionality index of your race, 
such a demonstration would prob- 
ably aid in the peaceful absorption 
of your culture into ours, but it is 
impossible,” 

Hawkins allowed himself the 
luxury of a quick smile. His analysis 
of the situation had been absolutely 
correct. “Well, look,” he said in 
reply. “According to our survey, 
the outer planet in this system is 
pretty small and of little use to any- 
body. Could you possibly destroy it 
instead?” He paused for just the 
smallest fraction of a second, but 
then hurried on before the alien 
could reply. “Of course, if you can’t 
do it without destroying all the rest 
of the planets too, why, we’ll un- 
derstand. But it would help . 

The alien’s voice boomed back, 
interrupting the man. “You obvi- 
ously still underestimate the tech- 
nological level of the Dakn Em- 


AVOI DANCE SITUATION 


35 



pire.” The alien paused as if 
checking something. “According to 
my analysis of this system, the 
fourth and outer planet is of no 
value whatsoever to my people. 
Therefore, I accede to your request. 
The planet will be destroyed at 
Once.” 

“Hey, wait a minute,” Hawkins 
cried in a startled tone of voice. 

“You need not worry,” came the 
alien’s flat response. “I fully realize 
that your visual recording equip- 
ment cannot function at such a dis- 
tance. Therefore, you will raise ship 
at once and locate yourself to take 
advantage of the best recording 
angles.” 

Hawkins had to hold himself in 
his chair to keep from dancing a 
jig. He had set a trap for the alien, 
and somehow, some incredible how, 
it had worked. At least he dared 
hope that it had . 

The Sunward came to a full stop 
just inside the orbit of the third 
planet. The alien ship danced on 
ahead of them towards the tiny 
outer world. “You can come closer 
than that,” Lan Sur informed 
Hawkins, noting that the Sunward 
had stopped sooner than expected. 

“No, thank you,” Hawkins re- 
plied. “We can get excellent pic- 
tures from this distance, and you 
must remember that we haven’t the 
protective devices that you have.” 

Hawkins noted that Lan Sur’s 
voice carried with it an almost 
petulant, disdainful note. “There is 
a great deal of difference between 
the destruction of one small planet 
and the creation of a nova. How- 
ever, if you feel safer there, you 


may remain where you are.” A few 
moments later, the alien added, 
"“Are your recording devices in 
readiness?” 

Hawkins indicated to the alien 
that they were. 

“Then watch,” Lan Sur said. 

It took perhaps three minutes for 
the first burst of light to reach their 
position. The tiny planet, scarcely 
500 miles in diameter, began to 
glow slightly, then suddenly came 
alive with fire. Bursts of flame 
danced up hundreds of miles above 
its surface, then fell back, ex- 
hausted, into the boiling cauldron 
the planet had become. For almost 
ten minutes the small world seethed 
in agonized torment, and then, all 
at once, it seemed to shake apart at 
the seams. There was no sound, but 
those watching on board the Sun- 
ward mentally supplied the missing 
component to the greatest explo- 
sion they had ever witnessed. The 
cameras recorded the scene noise- 
lessly. 

A few minutes later, after most 
of the fragments of the once-world 
had disintegrated in flaming splen- 
dor, Lan Sur’s voice broke the si- 
lence. “I used only one of many 
possible means of destruction. How- 
ever, it promised to be, under the 
circumstances, the most spectac- 
ular. And so you have seen the of- 
fensive might of the Dakn Empire. 
Are you ready to give me your de- 
cision?” 

The control board in front of 
Hawkins displayed all green sig- 
nals. “Yes,” he said. “I think we’re 
finally ready. Here is our answer to 
the choice you gave us.” His finger 
pressed firmly on a single red key. 


36 


JAMES MC CONNELL 



T HE Sunward had been hurling 
itself back towards Earth for al- 
most an hour when Broussard dis- 
covered Captain Hawkins, standing 
by himself in the observation room, 
staring out into the black of sub- 
space. 

“Well,” the psychologist said. “I 
don’t suppose it looks quite so bleak 
to you now as it did on the trip 
out.” 

Hawkins turned and smiled at 
the man. “No, I don’t guess it does. 
Funny what the presence of one 
small pinpoint of light does to the 
blackness of a field, eh?” 

Broussard nodded in assent. “I 
wonder what our alien friend 
thought when suddenly Clarion, 
Trellis, the two other planets, and 
us too, just up and disappeared and 
left him behind?” 

Hawkins laughed. “You’re the 
alienist. You tell me.” 

“I’d rather ask you something. 
How did you know it would 
work?” 

“You might say I became an ex- 
pert in psychology over night,” 
Hawkins replied. “Oh, not the 
scientific kind that you practice — 
but the every day kind that most 
people mean when they use the 
word. I discovered, for example, 
that because of a misunderstanding 
on the part of the communications 
people, we continued to send mes- 
sages home after the alien had 
specifically warned us not to do so. 
At first I thought he might be ig- 
noring this infraction of his rules, 
but then I began to wonder if it 
didn’t mean that he just wasn’t 
aware of what we were doing. I re- 
membered that he talked a great 


deal about a C 2 drive system which 
he claimed was so much better than 
the type we used. But when I asked 
the Navigator to do a little figuring, 
I discovered that by using subspace, 
we can actually get places much 
faster than his race does. 

“It all added up to the fact that 
his race had never stumbled onto 
the use of subspace. I know that 
sounds incredible, but when I 
checked with one of the top physi- 
cists, I found out that we happened 
onto it by sheer accident — and an 
impossibly stupid one at that — and 
not through any high-level theoriz- 
ing. The theory came later, after 
the process had been demonstrated 
in a laboratory. 

“For a while I still couldn’t be- 
lieve it. But when we discovered 
that his space ship was a very small 
one — too small to utilize the sub- 
space drive — I knew my guess had 
been correct. So I tricked him into 
letting us get into position where 
we could activate die drive — and 
had the engineers increase the ef- 
fective radius so that we could pull 
Clarion and her three planets into 
subspace with us.” Hawkins paused 
for a few seconds as he turned 
back to the observation window. 
“We’ll need every sun and every 
planet we can lay our hands on.” 

Broussard leaned comfortably 
back against the door. “I think you 
were wise to take the pictures of 
the destruction of that fourth 
planet. We may need them to con- 
vince ‘the folks back home’ that 
this was the only solution to the 
problem.” 

Hawkins agreed with him. “They 
won’t like giving up all the universe

they’ve come to be used to, just to 
run away and hide in subspace. 
And you know, I think the poets 
and the sailors and the young peo- 
ple in love will hate us most of all.” 

“How do you mean?” asked 
Broussard. 

“No more heaven full of stars to 
write poems about, to sail true 
courses by, and to sing love songs 
under. I guess a lot of us will be 
lonely for all the stars.” 

“Do you think they’ll ever find 
us?” ^Broussard asked, changing the 
subject. “From the look on Lan 
Sur’s face when he told about that 
other world, I suspect they’ll move 
heaven and earth to find out where 
we’ve run to.” 

“Find us? The Dakn Empire? I 
just don’t know. We’ve got a thou- 
sand ships equipped with the sub- 
space drive. That’s a thousand or 
so solar systems we can pull 
through into subspace before they 


can catch up with us — I hope. But 
we’ll have to be careful. If one of 
our ships is ever caught, and they 
discover the drive, we’re all done 
for. I doubt that they’ll show us 
much mercy. 

“A thousand suns — and only a 
handful of usable worlds in the 
whole lot of them. Not much for a 
race that’s grown as fast as ours 
has. And to some of us, I guess, 
subspace will never be quite the 
same as the one we grew up in — 
and came to know and love.” 
Hawkins shook his head sadly. 

“But if they find us?” Broussard 
insisted. 

“Well, at least we’ll have had 
time to prepare. Perhaps a year, 
perhaps ten, perhaps a thousand. 
But we beat them this time, and 
maybe we can do it again.” 

For a long time he continued to 
stare quietly into the blackness. “I 
just don’t know ...” • • • 


THE LAUNCHING AND DEATH 
OF THE SATELLITE 

THE TEMPORARY SATELLITE; announced by the U.S. as our contri- 
bution to the International Geophysical Year, will probably be launched 
as the third stage of a three-stage rocket. The first drawing (top) shows 
the rocket beginning its vertical climb; trailing characteristic shock

Flaming death comes to small satellite (days or weeks later) when 
gradual drag of thin atmosphere diminishes original speed to point where 
gravity pulls it down into denser air. Tremendous remaining speed will 
cause satellite to overheat from friction and vaporize in seconds. To

Clearly, re-educating Man’s brain wouldn’t fit him for survival 


on the plague-ridden surface . Re-educating his body was 


the answer; but the process was so very long .

T HE MAN in the white jacket the fallible human beings to whom 
stopped at the door marked it reported might think. It went 
“Re-Education Project — Col. H. over him from grey, crew-cut 
H. Mudgett, Commanding Of- poll to reagent-proof shoes, check- 
ficer” and waited while the scan- ing his small wiry body and lean 
ner looked him over. He had been profile against its stored silhouettes, 
through that door a thousand tasting and smelling him as dubi- 
times, but the scanner made as ously as if he were an orange held 
elaborate a job of it as if it had in storage two days too long, 
never seen him before. “Name?” it said at last. 

It always did, for there was al- “Carson, Samuel, 32-454-0698.” 
ways in fact a chance that it had “Business?” 
never seen him before, whatever “Medical director, Re-Ed One.”

While Carson waited, a distant, 
heavy concussion came rolling 
down upon him through the mile 
of solid granite above his head. At 
the same moment, the letters on the 
door — and everything else inside 
his cone of vision — blurred distress- 
ingly, and a stab of pure pain went 
lancing through his head. It was 
the supersonic component of the 
explosion, and it was harmless — 
except that it always both hurt and 
scared him. 

The light on the door-scanner, 


which had been glowing yellow up 
to now, flicked back to red again 
and the machine began the whole 
routine all over; the sound-bomb 
had reset it. Carson patiently en- 
dured its inspection, gave his name, 
serial number and mission once 
more, and this time got the green. 
He went in, unfolding as he walked 
the flimsy square of cheap paper he 
had been carrying all along. 

Mudgett looked up from his desk 
and said at once: “What now?” 

The physician tossed the square

of paper down under Mudgett’ s 
eyes. “Summary of the press reac- 
tion to Hamelin’s speech last 
night/’ he said. “The total effect is 
going against us, Colonel. Unless 
we can change Hamelin’s mind, 
this outcry to re-educate civilians 
ahead of soldiers is going to lose the 
war for us. The urge to live on the 
surface again has been mounting 
for ten years; now it’s got a target 
to focus on. Us.” 

Mudgett chewed on a pencil 
while he read the summary ; a 
blocky, bulky man, as short as Car- 
son and with hair as grey and close- 
cropped. A year ago, Carson would 
have told him that nobody in Re- 
Ed could afford to put stray objects 
in his mouth even once, let alone as 
a habit; now Carson just waited. 
There wasn’t a man — or a woman 
or a child — of America’s surviving 
thirty-five million “sane” people 
who didn’t have some such tic. Not 
now, not after twenty-five years of 
underground life. 

“He knows it’s impossible, 
doesn’t he?” Mudgett demanded 
abruptly. 

“Of course he doesn’t,” Carson 
said impatiently. “He doesn’t know 
any more about the real nature of 
the project than the people do. He 
thinks the ‘educating’ we do is in 
some sort of survival technique — 
That’s what the papers think, too, 
as you can plainly see by the way 
they loaded that editorial.” 

“Um. If we’d taken direct con- 
trol of the papers in the first 
place — ” 

Carson said nothing. Military 
control of every facet of civilian 
life was a fact, and Mudgett knew 


it. He also knew that an appear- 
ance of freedom to think is a neces- 
sity for the human mind — and that 
the appearance could not be main- 
tained without a few shreds of the 
actuality. 

“Suppose we do this,” Mudgett 
said at last. “Hamelin’s position in 
the State Department makes it im- 
possible for us to muzzle him. But 
it ought to be possible to explain to 
him that no unprotected human 
being can live on the surface, no 
matter how many Merit Badges he 
has for woodcraft and first aid. 
Maybe we could even take him on 
a little trip topside; I’ll wager he’s 
never seen it.” 

“And what if he dies up there?” 
Carson said stonily. “We lose three- 
fifths of every topside party as it is 
— and Hamelin’s an inexperi- 
enced — ” 

“Might be the best thing, 
mightn’t it?” 

“No,” Carson said. “It would 
look like we’d planned it that way. 
The papers would have the pop- 
ulace boiling by the next morning.” 

Mudgett groaned and nibbled 
another double row of indentations 
around the barrel of the pencil. 
“There must be something,” he 
said. 

“There is.” 

“Well?” 

“Bring the man here and show 
him just what we are doing. Re- 
educate him, if necessary. Once 
we told the newspapers that he’d 
taken the course . well, who 
knows, they just might resent it. 
Abusing his clearance privileges 
and so on.” 

“We’d be violating our basic

policy/’ Mudgett said slowly. 
“ ‘Give the Earth back to the men 
who fight for it.’ Still, the idea has 
some merits . 

“Hamelin is out in the ante- 
chamber right now,” Carson said. 
“Shall I bring him in?” 

The radioactivity never did rise 
much beyond a mildly hazardous 
level, and that was only transient, 
during the second week of the war 
—the week called the Death of 
Cities. The small shards of sanity 
retained by the high commands on 
both sides dictated avoiding weap- 
ons with a built-in backfire: no 
cobalt bombs were dropped, no ter- 
ritories permanently poisoned. Gen- 
erals still remembered that unoc- 
cupied territory, no matter how 
devastated, is still unconquered ter- 
ritory. 

But no such considerations stood 
in the way of biological warfare. It 
was controllable : you never re- 
leased against the enemy any dis- 
ease you didn’t yourself know how 
to control. There would be some 
slips, of course, but the margin for 
error — 

There were some slips. But for 
the most part, biological warfare 
worked fine. The great fevers 
washed like tides around and 
around the globe, one after an- 
other. In such cities as had escaped 
the bombings, the rumble of truck 
convoys carrying the puffed heaped 
corpses to the mass graves became 
the only sound except for sporadic 
small-arms fire; and then that too 
ceased, and the trucks stood rust- 
ing in rows. 

Nor were human beings the sole 


victims. Cattle fevers were sent out. 
Wheat rusts, rice molds, com 
blights, hog choleras, poultry en- 
teritises fountained into the indif- 
ferent air from the hidden labora- 
tories, or were loosed far aloft, in 
the jet-stream, by rocketing fleets. 
Gelatin capsules pullulating with 
gill-rots fell like hail into the great 
fishing grounds of Newfoundland, 
Oregon, Japan, Sweden, Portugal. 
Hundreds of species of animals 
were drafted as secondary hosts for 
human diseases, were injected and 
released to carry the blessings of 
the laboratories to their mates and 
litters. It was discovered that mi- 
nute amounts of the tetracycline 
series of antibiotics, which had long 
been used as feed supplements to 
bring farm animals to full market 
weight early, could also be used to 
raise the most whopping Anopheles 
and Aedes mosquitoes anybody ever 
saw, capable of flying long dis- 
tances against the wind and of 
carrying a peculiarly interesting 
new strains of the malarial parasite 
and the yellow fever virus . 

By the time it had ended, every- 
one who remained alive was a mile 
under ground. 

For good. 

“I still fail to understand why,” 
Hamelin said, “if, as you claim, 
you have methods of re-educating 
soldiers for surface life, you can’t 
do so for civilians as well. Or in- 
stead.” 

The under-secretary, a tall, spare 
man, bald on top, and with a 
heavily creased forehead, spoke 
with the odd neutral accent — un- 
tinged by regionalism — of the

trained diplomat, despite the fact 
that there had been no such thing 
as a foreign service for nearly half 
a century. 

“We’re going to try to explain 
that to you,” Carson said. “But we 
thought that, first of all, we’d try 
to explain once more why we think 
it would be bad policy — as well as 
physically out of the question. 

“Sure, everybody wants to go 
topside as soon as it’s possible. Even 
people who are reconciled to these 
endless caverns and corridors hope 
for something better for their chil- 
dren — a glimpse of sunlight, a little 
rain, the fall of a leaf. That’s more 
important now to all of us than the 
war, which we don’t believe in any 
longer. That doesn’t even make any 
military sense, since we haven’t the 
numerical strength to occupy the 
enemy’s territory any more, and 
they haven’t the strength to occupy 
ours. We understand all that. But 
we also know that the enemy is in- 
tent on prosecuting the war to the 
end. Extermination is what they 
say they want, on their propaganda 
broadcasts, and your own Depart- 
ment reports that they seem to 
mean what they say. So we can’t 
give up fighting them; that would 
be simple suicide. Are you still with 
me?” 

“Yes, but I don’t see — ” 

“Give me a moment more. If we 
have to continue to fight, we know 
this much : that the first of the two 
sides to get men on the surface 
again— so as to be able to attack 
important targets, not just keep 
them isolated in seas of plagues — 
will be the side that will bring this 
war to an end. They know that. 


too. We have good season to be- 
lieve that they have a re-educa- 
tion project, and that it’s about as 
far advanced as ours is.” 

“Look at it this way,” Col. 
Mudgett burst in unexpectedly. 
“What we have now is a stalemate. 
A saboteur occasionally locates one 
of the underground cities and lets 
the pestilences into it. Sometimes 
on our side, sometimes on theirs. 
But that only happens sporadically, 
and it’s just more of this mutual 
extermination business — to which 
we’re committed, willy-nilly, for as 
long as they are. If we can get 
troops onto the surface first, we’ll 
be able to scout out their important 
installations in short order, and is- 
sue them a surrender ultimatum 
with teeth in it. They’ll take it. The 
only other course is the sort of slow, 
mutual suicide we’ve got now.” 

Hamelin put the tips of his fin- 
gers together. “You gentlemen lec- 
ture me about policy as if I had 
never heard the word before. I’m 
familiar with your arguments for 
sending soldiers first. You assume 
that you’re familiar with all of 
mine for starting with civilians, but 
you’re wrong, because some of 
them haven’t been brought up at 
all outside the Department. I’m 
going to tell you some of them, and 
I think they’ll merit your close at- 
tention.” 

Carson shrugged. “I’d like noth- 
ing better than to be convinced, 
Mr. Secretary. Go ahead.” 

“You of all people should know. 
Dr. Carson, how close our under- 
ground society is to a psychotic 
break. To take a single instance, 
the number of juvenile gangs roam-

ing these corridors of ours has in- 
creased 400% since the rumors 
about the Re-Education Project 
began to spread. Or another: the 
number of individual crimes with- 
out motive — crimes committed, 
just to distract the committer from 
the grinding monotony of the life 
we all lead — has now passed the 
total of all other crimes put to- 
gether. 

“And as for actual insanity — of 
our thirty-five million people still 
unhospitalized, there are four mil- 
lion cases of which we know , each 
one of which should be committed 
right now for early paranoid schizo- 
phrenia — except that were we to 
commit them, our essential indus- 
tries would suffer a manpower loss 
more devastating than anything the 
enemy has inflicted upon us. Every 
one of those four million persons is 
a major hazard to his neighbors 
and to his job, but how can we do 
without them? And what can we 
do about the unrecognized, sub- 
clinical cases, which probably total 
twice as many? How long can we 
continue operating without a col- 
lapse under such conditions ?” 

Carson mopped his brow. “I 
didn’t suspect that it had gone that 
far.” 

“It has gone that far,” Hamelin 
said icily, “and it is accelerating. 
Your own project has helped to ac- 
celerate it. Col. Mudgett here men- 
tioned the opening of isolated cities 
to the pestilences. Shall I tell you 
how Louisville fell?” 

“A spy again, I suppose,” 
Mudgett said. 

“No, Colonel. Not a spy. A band 
of — of vigilantes, of mutineers. I’m 


familiar with your slogan, ‘The 
Earth to those who fight for it.’ Do 
you know the counter-slogan that’s 
circulating among the people?” 
They waited. Hamelin smiled 
and said : “ ‘Let’s die on the sur- 
face.’ 

“They overwhelmed the military 
detachment there, put the city ad- 
ministration to death, and blew 
open the shaft to the surface. About 
a thousand people actually made it 
to the top. Within twenty-four 
hours the city was dead — as the 
ringleaders had been warned would 
be the outcome. The warning 
didn’t deter them. Nor did it pro- 
tect the prudent citizens who had 
no part in the affair.” 

Hamelin leaned forward sudden- 
ly. “People won’t wait to be told 
when it’s their turn to be re-edu- 
cated. They’ll be tired of waiting, 
tired to the point of insanity of liv- 
ing at the bottom of a hole. They’ll 
just go. 

“And that, gentlemen, will leave 
the world to the enemy ... or, more 
likely, the rats. They alone are im- 
mune to everything by now.” 
There was a long silence. At last 
Carson said mildly: “Why aren’t 
we immune to everything by now?” 
“Eh? Why — the new genera- 
tions. They’ve never been exposed.” 
“We still have a reservoir of 
older people who lived through the 
war: people who had one or sev- 
eral of the new diseases that swept 
the world, some as many as five, 
and yet recovered. They still have 
their immunities; we know; we’ve 
tested them. We know from sam- 
pling that no new disease has been 
introduced by either side in over

ten years now. Against all the 
known ones, we have immunization 
techniques, anti-sera, antibiotics, 
and so on. I suppose you get your 
shots every six months like all the 
rest of us; we should all be very 
hard to infect now, and such in- 
fections as do take should run mild 
courses.” Carson held the under- 
secretary’s eyes grimly. “Now, an- 
swer me this question: why is it 
that, despite all these protections, 
every single person in an opened 
city dies?” 

“I don’t know,” Hamelin said, 
staring at each of them in turn. 
“By your showing, some of them 
should recover.” 

“They should,” Carson said. 
“But nobody does. Why? Because 
the very nature of disease has 
changed since we all went under- 
ground. There are now abroad in 
the world a number of mutated 
bacterial strains which can bypass 
the immunity mechanisms of the 
human body altogether. What this 
means in simple terms is that, 
should such a germ get into your 
body, your body wouldn’t recognize 
it as an invader. It would manufac- 
ture no antibodies against the germ. 
Consequently, the germ could mul- 
tiply without any check, and — you 
would die. So would we all.” 

“I see,” Hamelin said. He 
seemed to have recovered his com- 
posure extraordinarily rapidly. “I 
am no scientist, gentlemen, but 
what you tell me makes our posi- 
tion sound perfectly hopeless. Yet 
obviously you have some answer.” 

Carson nodded. “We do. But it’s 
important for you to understand 
the situation, otherwise the answer 


will mean nothing to you. So: is it 
perfectly clear to you now, from 
what we’ve said so far, that no 
amount of re-educating a man’s 
brain, be he soldier or civilian, will 
allow him to survive on the sur- 
face?” 

“Quite clear,” Hamelin said, ap- 
parently ungrudgingly. Carson’s 
hopes rose by a fraction of a milli- 
meter. “But if you don’t re-educate 
his brain, what can you re-educate? 
His reflexes, perhaps?” 

“No,” Carson said. “His lymph 
nodes, and his spleen.” 

A scornful grin began to appear 
on Hamelin’s thin lips. “You need 
better public relations counsel than 
you’ve been getting,” he said. “If 
what you say is true — as of course I 
assume it is — then the term ‘re-edu- 
cate’ is not only inappropriate, it’s 
downright misleading. If you had 
chosen a less suggestive and more 
accurate label in the beginning, I 
wouldn’t have been able to cause 
you half the trouble I have.” 

“I agree that we were badly ad- 
vised there,” Carson said. “But not 
entirely for those reasons. Of course 
the name is misleading; that’s both 
a characteristic and a function of 
the names of top secret projects. 
But in this instance, the name ‘Re- 
Education’, bad as it now appears, 
subjected the men who chose it to 
a fatal temptation. You see, though 
it is misleading, it is also entirely 
accurate.” 

“Word-games,” Hamelin said. 

“Not at all,” Mudgett inter- 
posed. “We were going to spare you 
the theoretical reasoning behind 
our project, Mr. Secretary, but now 
you’ll just have to sit still for it. The

45 



fact is that the body’s ability to dis- 
tinguish between its own cells and 
those of some foreign tissue — a skin 
graft, say, or a bacterial invasion of 
the blood — isn’t an inherited abil- 
ity. It’s a learned reaction. Further- 
more, if you’ll think about it a mo- 
ment, you’ll see that it has to be. 
Body cells die, too, and have to be 
disposed of; what would happen if 
removing those dead cells provoked 
an antibody reaction, as the de- 
struction of foreign cells does? 
We’d die of anaphylactic shock 
while we were still infants. 

“For that reason, the body has to 
learn how to scavenge selectively. 
In human beings, that lesson isn’t 
learned completely until about a 
month after birth. During the inter- 
vening time, the newborn infant is 
protected by antibodies that it gets 
from the colestrum, the ‘first milk’ 
it gets from the breast during the 
three or four days immediately after 
birth. It can’t generate its own; it 
isn’t allowed to, so to speak, until 
it’s learned the trick of cleaning up 
body residues without triggering the 
antibody mechanisms. Any dead 
cells marked ‘personal’ have to be 
dealt with some other way.” 

“That seems clear enough,” 
Hamelin said. “But I don’t see its 
relevance.” 

“Well, we’re in a position now 
where that differentiation between 
the self and everything outside the 
body doesn’t do us any good any 
more. These mutated bacteria have 
been ‘selfed’ by the mutation. In 
other words, some of their protein 
molecules, probably desoxyribonu- 
cleic acid molecules, carry config- 
urations or ‘recognition-units’ iden- 


tical with those of our body cells, 
so that the body can’t tell one from 
another.” 

“But what has all this to do with 
re-education?” 

“Just this,” Carson said. “What 
we do here is to impose upon the 
cells of the body — all of them — a 
new set of recognition-units for the 
guidance of the lymph nodes and 
the spleen, which are the organs 
that produce antibodies. The new 
units are highly complex, and the 
chances of their being duplicated 
by bacterial evolution, even under 
forced draught, are too small to 
worry about. That’s what Re-Edu- 
cation is. In a few moments, if you 
like, we’ll show you just how it’s 
done.” 

Hamelin ground out his fifth 
cigarette in Mudgett’s ashtray and 
placed the tips of his fingers to- 
gether thoughtfully. Carson won- 
dered just how much of the con- 
cept of recognition-marking the 
under-secretary had absorbed. It 
had to be admitted that he was 
astonishingly quick to take hold of 
abstract ideas, but the self-marker 
theory of immunity was — like 
everything else in immunology — 
almost impossible to explain to lay- 
men, no matter how intelligent. 

“This process,” Hamelin said 
hesitantly. “It takes a long time?” 

“About six hours per subject, and 
we can handle only one man at a 
time. That means that we can 
count on putting no more than 
seven thousand troops into the field 
by the turn of the century. Every 
one will have to be a highly trained 
specialist, if we’re to bring the war 
to a quick conclusion.”

JAMES BLISH 



“Which means no civilians,” 
Hamelin said. “I see. I’m not en- 
tirely convinced, but — by all means 
let’s see how it’s done.” 


O NCE INSIDE, the under-sec- 
retary tried his best to look 
everywhere at once. The room cut 
into the rock was roughly two hun- 
dred feet high. Most of it was occu- 
pied by the bulk of the Re-Educa- 
tion Monitor, a mechanism as tall 
as a fifteen-storey building, and 
about a city block square. Guards 
watched it on all sides, and the face 
of the machine swarmed with tech- 
nicians. 

“Incredible,” Hamelin mur- 
mured. “That enormous object can 
process only one man at a time?” 
“That’s right,” Mudgett said. 
“Luckily it doesn’t have to treat all 
the body cells directly. It works 
through the blood, re-selfing the 
cells by means of small changes in 
the serum chemistry.” 

“What kind of changes?” 

“Well,” Carson said, choosing 
each word carefully, “that’s more 
or less a graveyard secret, Mr. Sec- 
retary. We can tell you this much: 
the machine uses a vast array of 
crystalline, complex sugars which 
behave rather like the blood group- 
and-type proteins. They’re fed into 
the serum in minute amounts, un- 
der feedback control of second-by- 
second analysis of the blood. The 
computations involved in deciding 
upon the amount and the precise 
nature of each introduced chemical 
are highly complex. Hence the size 
of the machine. It is, in its major 
effect, an artificial kidney.” 


“I’ve seen artificial kidneys in the 
hospitals,” Hamelin said, frowning. 
“They’re rather compact affairs.” 

“Because all they do is remove 
waste products from the patient’s 
blood, and restore the fluid and 
electrolyte balance. Those are very 
minor renal functions in the higher 
mammals. The organ’s main duty 
is chemical control of immunity. If 
Burnet and Fenner had known that 
back in 1949, when the selfing 
theory was being formulated, we’d 
have had Re-Education long be- 
fore now.” 

“Most of the machine’s size is 
due to the computation section,” 
Mudgett emphasized. “In the 
body, the brain-stem does those 
computations, as part of main- 
taining homeostasis. But we can’t 
reach the brain-stem from outside; 
it’s not under conscious control. 
Once the body is re-selfed, it will 
re-train the thalamus where we 
can’t.” Suddenly, two swinging 
doors at the base of the machine 
were pushed apart and a mobile 
operating table came through, 
guided by two attendants. There 
was a form on it, covered to the 
chin with a sheet. The face above 
the sheet was immobile and almost 
as white. 

Hamelin watched the table go 
out of the huge cavern with visibly 
mixed emotions. He said: “This 
process — it’s painful?” 

“No, not exactly,” Carson said. 
The motive behind the question 
interested him hugely, but he didn’t 
dare show it. “But any fooling 
around with the immunity mech- 
anisms can give rise to symptoms — 
fever, general malaise, and so on.

We try to protect our subjects by 
giving them a light shock anesthe- 
sia first.” 

“Shock?” Hamelin repeated. 
“You mean electroshock? I don’t 
see how* — ” 

“Call it stress anesthesia instead. 
We give the man a steroid drug 
that counterfeits the anesthesia the 
body itself produces in moments of 
great stress — on the battlefield, say, 
or just after a serious injury. It’s 
fast, and free of after-effects. 
There’s no secret about that, by 
the way; the drug involved is 21- 
hydroxypregnane-3,20 dione sodium 
succinate, and it dates all the way 
back to 1955.” 

“Oh,” the under-secretary said. 
The ringing sound of the chemi- 
cal name had had, as Carson had 
hoped, a ritually soothing effect. 

“Gentlemen,” Hamelin said hes- 
itantly. “Gentlemen, I have a — 
a rather unusual request. And, I 
am afraid, a rather selfish one.” A 
brief, nervous laugh. “Selfish in 
both senses, if you will pardon 
me the pun. You need feel no hes- 
itation in refusing me, but . .” 

Abruptly he appeared to find it 
impossible to go on. Carson men- 
tally crossed his fingers and plunged 
in. 

“You would like to undergo the 
process yourself?” he said. 

“Well, yes. Yes, that’s exactly it. 
Does that seem inconsistent? I 
should know, should I not, what it 
is that I’m advocating for my fol- 
lowing? Know it intimately, from 
personal experience, not just 
theory? Of course I realize that it 
would conflict with your policy, 
but I assure you I wouldn’t turn 

48 


it to any political advantage — none 
whatsoever. And perhaps it 
wouldn’t be too great a lapse of 
policy to process just one civilian 
among your seven thousand sol- 
diers.” 

Subverted, by God ! Carson 
looked at Mudgett with a firmly 
straight face. It wouldn’t do to 
accept too quickly. 

But Hamelin was rushing on, al- 
most chattering now. “I can under- 
stand your hesitation. You must 
feel that I’m trying to gain some 
advantage, or even to get to the 
surface ahead of my fellow-men. If 
it will set your minds at rest, I 
would be glad to enlist in your ad- 
vance army. Before five years are 
up, I could surely learn some tech- 
nical skill which would make me 
useful to the expedition. If you 
would prepare papers to that effect, 
I’d be happy to sign them.” 

“That’s hardly necessary,” Mud- 
gett said. “After you’re Re-Edu- 
cated, we can simply announce the 
fact, and say that you’ve agreed to 
join the advance party when the 
time comes.” 

“Ah,” Hamelin said. “I see the 
difficulty. No, that would make my 
position quite impossible. If there is 
no other way — ” 

“Excuse us a moment,” Carson 
said. Hamelin bowed, and the doc- 
tor pulled Mudgett off out of ear- 
shot. 

“Don’t overplay it,” he mur- 
mured. “You’re tipping our hand 
with that talk about a press release, 
Colonel. He’s offering us a bribe — 
but he’s plenty smart enough to 
see that the price you’re suggesting 
is that of his whole political career, 

JAMES BUSH 



He won’t pay that much.” 

“What then?” Mudgett whis- 
pered hoarsely. 

“Get somebody to prepare the 
kind of informal contract he sug- 
gested. Offer to put it under se- 
curity seal so we won’t be able to 
show it to the press at all. He’ll 
know well enough that such a 
seal can be broken if our policy 
ever comes before a presidential re- 
view — and that will restrain him 
from forcing such a review. Let’s 
not demand too much. Once he’s 
been re-educated, he’ll have to 
live the rest of the five years with 
the knowledge that he can live 
topside any time he wants to try 
it — and he hasn’t had the discipline 
our men have had. It’s my bet that 
he’ll goof off before the five years 
are up — and good riddance.” 

They went back to Hamelin, 
who was watching the machine and 
humming in a painfully abstracted 
manner. 

“I’ve convinced the Colonel,” 
Carson said, “that your services in 
the army might well be very valu- 
able when the time comes, Mr. 
Secretary. If you’ll sign up, we’ll 
put the papers under security seal 
for your own protection, and then 
I think we can fit you into our 
treatment program today.” 

“I’m grateful to you, Dr. Carson,” 
Hamelin said. “Very grateful , in- 
deed.” 

Five minutes after his injection, 
Hamelin was as peaceful as a 
flounder and was rolled through 
the swinging doors. An hour’s dis- 
cussion of the probable outcome, 
carried on in the privacy of Mud- 


gett’s office, bore very little ad- 
ditional fruit, however. 

“It’s our only course,” Carson 
said. “It’s what we hoped to gain 
from his visit, duly modified by 
circumstances. It all comes down 
to this: Hamelin’s compromised 
himself, and he knows it.” 

“But,” Mudgett said, “suppose 
he was right? What about all that 
talk of his about mass insanity?” 
“I’m sure it’s true,” Carson said, 
his voice trembling slightly despite 
his best efforts at control. “It’s go- 
ing to be rougher than ever down 
here for the next five years, Colo- 
nel. Our only consolation is that 
the enemy must have exactly the 
same problem; and if we can beat 
them to the surface — ” 

“ Hsst !” Mudgett said. Carson 
had already broken off his sentence. 
He wondered why the scanner gave 
a man such a hard time outside 
that door, and then admitted him 
without any warning to the people 
on the other side. Couldn’t the 
damned thing be trained to knock? 

The newcomer was a page from 
the haemotology section. “Here’s 
the preliminary rundown on your 
‘Student X’, Dr. Carson,” he said. 

The page saluted Mudgett and 
went out. Carson began to read. 
After a moment, he also began to 
sweat. 

“Colonel, look at this. I was 
wrong after all. Disastrously wrong. 
I haven’t seen a blood-type distri- 
bution pattern like Hamelin’s since 
I was a medical student, and even 
back then it was only a demon- 
stration, not a real live patient. 
Look at it from the genetic point 
of view — the migration factors.”

He passed the protocol across the 
desk. Mudgett was not by back- 
ground a scientist, but he was an 
enormously able administrator, of 
the breed that makes it its busi- 
ness to know the technicalities on 
which any project ultimately rests. 
He was not much more than half- 
way through the tally before his 
eyebrows were gaining altitude like 
shock-waves. 

“Carson, we can’t let that man 
into the machine! He’s — ” 

“He’s already in it, Colonel, you 
know that. And if we interrupt the 
process before it runs to term, we’ll 
kill him.” 

“Let’s kill him, then,” Mudgett 
said harshly. “Say he died while 
being processed. Do the country a 
favor.” 

“That would produce a hell of 
a stink. Besides, we have no proof.” 

Mudgett flourished the protocol 
excitedly. 

“That’s not proof to anyone but 
a haemotologist.” 

“But Carson, the man’s a sab- 
oteur!” Mudgett shouted. “Nobody 
but an Asiatic could have a typing 
pattern like this! And he’s no melt- 
ing-pot product, either — he’s a 
classical mixture, very probably a 
Georgian. And every move he’s 
made since we first heard of him 
has been aimed directly at us — 
aimed directly at tricking us into 
getting him into the machine!” 

“I think so too,” Carson said 
grimly. “I just hope the enemy 
hasn’t many more agents as bril- 
liant.” 

“One’s enough,” Mudgett said. 
“He’s sure to be loaded to the last 
cc of his blood with catalyst poi- 


sons. Once the machine starts pro- 
cessing his serum, we’re done for 
— it’ll take us years to re-program 
the computer, if it can be done at 
all. It’s got to be stopped!” 

“Stopped?” Carson said, aston- 
ished. “But it’s already stopped. 
That’s not what worries me. The 
machine stopped it fifty minutes 
ago.” 

“It can’t have! How could it? 
It has no relevant data!” 

“Sure it has.” Carson leaned for- 
ward, took the cruelly chewed pen- 
cil away from Mudgett, and made 
a neat check beside one of the 
entries on the protocol. Mudgett 
stared at the checked item. 

“Platelets Rh VI? he mumbled. 
“But what’s that got to do with 
. Oh. Oh, I see. That platelet 
type doesn’t exist at all in our pop- 
ulation now, does it? Never seen it 
before myself, at least.” 

“No,” Carson said, grinning 
wolfishly. “It never was common 
in the West, and the pogrom of 
1981 wiped it out. That’s some- 
thing the enemy couldn’t know. 
But the machine knows it. As soon 
as it gives him the standard anti- 
IV desensitization shot, his platelets 
will begin to dissolve — and he’ll be 
rejected for incipient thrombocyto- 
penia.” He laughed. “For his own 
protection! But — ” 

“But he’s getting nitrous oxide in 
the machine, and he’ll be held six 
hours under anesthesia anyhow — 
also for his own protection,” Mud- 
gett broke in. He was grinning back 
at Carson like an idiot. “When he 
comes out from under, he’ll assume 
that he’s been re-educated, and 
he’ll beat it back to the enemy to

JAMES BLISH 



report that he’s poisoned our ma- 
chine, so that they can be sure 
they’ll beat us to the surface. And 
he’ll go the fastest way: overland.” 

“He will,” Carson agreed. “Of 
course he’ll go overland, and of 
course he’ll die. But where does 
that leave us? We won’t be able to 
conceal that he was treated here, if 
there’s any sort of an inquiry at all. 
And his death will make every- 
thing we do here look like a fraud. 
Instead of paying our Pied Piper — 
and great jumping Jehosophat, 
look at his name! They were rub- 
bing our noses in it all the time! 
Nevertheless, we didn’t pay the 
piper; we killed him. And ‘platelets 
Rh VI* won’t be an adequate ex- 
cuse for the press, or for Hamelin’s 
following.” 

“It doesn’t worry me,” Mudgett 
rumbled. “Who’ll know? He won’t 
die in our labs. He’ll leave here 
hale and hearty. He won’t die until 
he makes a break for the surface. 
After that we can compose a fine 
obituary for the press. Heroic gov- 
ernment official, on the highest 
policy level — couldn’t wait to lead 
his followers to the surface — died 
of being too much in a hurry — Re- 

■ i'Ui. 


Ed Project sorrowfully reminds 
everyone that no technique is fool- 
proof — ” 

Mudgett paused long enough to 
light a cigarette, which was a most 
singular action for a man who 
never smoked. “As a matter of fact, 
Carson,” he said, it’s a natural.” 
Carson considered it. It seemed 
to hold up. And ‘Hamelin’ would 
have a death certificate as complex 
as he deserved — not officially, of 
course, but in the minds of every- 
one who knew the facts. His death, 
when it came, would be due direct- 
ly to the thrombocytopenia which 
had caused the Re-Ed machine to 
reject him — and thrombocytopenia 
is a disease of infants. Unless ye 
become as little children . 

That was a fitting reason for re- 
jection from the new kingdom of 
Earth: anemia of the newborn. 

His pent breath went out of him 
in a long sigh. He hadn’t been 
aware that he’d been holding it. 
“It’s true,” he said softly. “That’s 
the time to pay the piper.” 
“When?” Mudgett said. 
“When?” Carson said, surprised. 
“Why, before he takes the children 
away.” # • •

U P THE concrete steps. Slowly, one, two, three, four. 

Down the naked, ice-white corridor. The echo of 
his footfalls like drumbeats, ominous, threatening. 

Around him, bodies, faces, moving dimly behind the 
veil of his fear. 

At last, above an oaken door, the black-lettered sign: 

DEPARTMENT OF LAND-JET VEHICLES 
DIVISION OF LICENSES 


He took a deep breath. He with- 
drew his handkerchief and wiped 
perspiration from his forehead, his 
upper lip, the palms of his hands. 

His mind caressed the hope : 
Maybe I’ve failed the tests. Maybe 
they won't give me a license . 

He opened the door and stepped 
inside. 

The metallic voice of a robot- 
receptionist hummed at him: 

“Name?” 

“T — Tom Rogers.” 


Click. “Have you an appoint- 
ment?” 

His gaze ran over the multitude 
of silver-boxed analyzers, comput- 
ers, tabulators, over the white-clad 
technicians and attendants, over 
the endless streams of taped data 
fed from mouths in the dome- 
shaped ceiling. 

“Have you an appointment?” re- 
peated the robot. 

“Oh. At 4:45 p. m.” 

Click. “Follow the red arrow in

Aisle Three, please.” 

Tom Rogers moved down the 
aisle, eyes wide on the flashing, 
arrow-shaped lights just beneath 
the surface of the quartzite floor. 

Abruptly, he found himself be- 
fore a desk. Someone pushed him 
into a foam-rubber contour chair. 

“Surprised, eh, boy?” boomed a 
deep voice. “No robots at this stage 
of the game. No sir. This requires 
the human touch. Get me?” 

“Uh-huh.” 

“Well, let’s see now.” The man 
settled back in his chair behind the 
desk and began thumbing through 
a file of papers. He was paunchy 
and bald save for a forepeak of red- 
brown fuzz. His gray eyes, with the 
dreamy look imposed by thick con- 
tact lenses, were kindly. Sweeping 
across his flat chest were two rows 
of rainbow-bright Driver’s Ribbons. 
Two of the bronze accident stars 
were flanked by smaller stars which 
indicated limb replacements. 

Belatedly, Tom noticed the desk’s 
aluminum placard which read 
Harry Hayden , Final Examiner — 
Human. 

Tom thought, Please, Harry 
Hayden, tell me 1 failed. Don 3 t 
lead up to it. Please come out and 
say 1 failed the tests. 

“Haven’t had much time to look 
over your file,” mused Harry Hay- 
den. “Thomas Darwell Rogers. Oc- 
cupation: journalism student. Un- 
married. No siblings. Height, five- 
eleven. Weight, one-sixty-three. 
Age, twenty.” 

Harry Hayden frowned. “Twen- 
ty?” he repeated, looking up. 

Oh, God, here it comes again . 

“Yes, sir,” said Tom Rogers. 


Harry Hayden’s face hardened. 
“You’ve tried to enlist before? You 
were turned down?” 

“This is my first application.” 
Sudden hostility swept aside 
Harry Hayden’s expression of kind- 
liness. He scowled at Tom’s file. 
“Bom July 18, 2020. This is July 
16, 2041. In two days you’ll be 
twenty-one. We don’t issue new 
licenses to people over twenty-one.” 
“I — I know, sir. The psychiatrists 
believe you adjust better to Driving 
when you’re young.” 

“In fact,” glowered Harry Hay- 
den, “in two days you’d have been 
classified as an enlistment evader. 
Our robo-statistics department 
would have issued an automatic 
warrant of arrest.” 

“I know, sir.” 

“Then why*d you wait so long?” 
The voice was razor-sharp. 

Tom wiped a fresh burst of' sweat 
from his forehead. “Well, you know 
how one keeps putting things off. I 
just—” 

“You don’t put off things like 
this, boy. Why, my three sons were 
lined up here at five in the morn- 
ing on their sixteenth birthdays. 
Every mother’s son of ’em. They’d 
talked of nothing else since they 
were twelve. Used to play Drivers 
maybe six, seven hours every day 
. .” His voice trailed. 

“Most kids are like that,” said 
Tom. 

“Weren’t you? 93 The hostility in 
Harry Hayden seemed to be churn- 
ing like boiling water. 

“Oh, sure,” lied Tom. 

“I don’t get it. You say you 
wanted to Drive, but you didn’t try 
to enlist.”

EDWARD W. LUDWIG 



Tom squirmed. 

You can't tell him you've been 
scared of jetmoliles ever since you 
saw that crash when you were 
three. You can't say that, at seven, 
you saw your grandfather die in a 
jetmobile and that after that you 
wouldn't even play with a jetmobile 
toy . You can't tell him those things 
because five years of psychiatric 
treatment didn't get the fear out of 
you. If the medics didn't under- 
stand, how could Harry Hayden? 

Tom licked his lips. And you 
can't tell him how you used to lie 
in bed praying you'd die before you 
were sixteen — or how you've 
pleaded with Mom and Dad not to 
make you enlist till you were twen- 
ty. You can't — 

Inspiration struck him. He 
clenched his fists. “It — it was my 
mother, sir. You know how mothers 
are sometimes. Hate to see their 
kids grow up. Hate to see them put 
on a uniform and risk being killed.” 

Harry Hayden digested the ex- 
planation for a few seconds. It 
seemed to pacify him. “By golly, 
that’s right. Esther took it hard 
when Mark died in a five-car bang- 
up out of San Francisco. And when 
Larry got his three summers ago in 
Europe. Esther’s my wife — Mark 
was my youngest, Larry the oldest.” 

He shook his head. “But it isn’t 
as bad as it used to be. Organ and 
limb grafts are pretty well per- 
fected, and with electro-hypnosis 
operations are painless. The only 
fatalities now are when death is 
immediate, when it happens before 
the medics get to you. Why, no 
more than one out of ten Drivers 
died in the last four-year period.” 


A portion of his good nature re- 
turned. “Anyway, your personal 
life’s none of my business. You un- 
derstand the enlistment contract?” 

Tom nodded. Damn you, Harry 
Hayden, let me out of here. Tell me 
I failed, tell me 1 passed. But damn 
you, let me out. 

“Well?” said Harry Hayden, 
waiting. 

“Oh. The enlistment contract. 
First enlistment is for four years. 
Renewal any time during the 
fourth year at the option of the en- 
listee. Minimum number of hours 
required per week: seven. Use of 
unauthorized armour or offensive 
weapons punishable by $5,000.00 
fine or five years in prison. All acci- 
dents and deaths not witnessed by 
a Jetway ’copter-jet must be re- 
ported at once by visi-phone to 
nearest Referee and Medical Depot. 
Oh yes, maximum speed : 900 miles 
per.” 

“Right! You got it, boy!” Harry 
Hayden paused, licking his lips. 
“Now, let’s see. Guess I’d better ask 
another question or two. This is 
your final examination, you know. 
What do you remember about the 
history of Driving?” 

Tom was tempted to say, “Go 
to Hell, you fat idiot,” but he knew 
that whatever he did or said now 
was of no importance. The robot- 
training tests he’d undergone dur- 
ing the past three weeks, only, were 
of importance. 

Dimly, he heard himself repeat- 
ing the phrases beaten into his mind 
by school history- tapes : 

“In the 20th Century a majority 
of the Earth’s peoples were filled 
with hatreds and frustrations. Hu-

manity was cursed with a world 
war every generation or so. Be- 
tween wars, young people had no 
outlets for their energy, and many 
of them formed bands of delin- 
quents. Even older people devel- 
oped an alarming number of psy- 
choses and neuroses. 

“The institution of Driving was 
established in 1998 after automo- 
biles were declared obsolete be- 
cause of their great number. The 
Jetways were retained for use of 
young people in search of thrills.” 

“Right!” Harry Hayden broke 
in. “Now, the kids get all the ex- 
citement they need, and there are 
no more delinquent bands and 
wars. When you’ve spent a hitch or 
two killing or almost being killed, 
you’re mature. You’re ready to set- 
tle down and live a quiet life — just 
like most of the old-time war vet- 
erans used to do. And you’re 
trained to think and act fast, you’ve 
got good judgment. And the weak 
and unfit are weeded out. Right, 
boy?” 

Tom nodded. A thought forced 
its way up from the layer of fear 
that covered his mind. “Right — as 
far as it goes.” 

“How’s that?” 

Tom’s voice quavered, but he 
said, “I mean that’s part of it. The 
rest is that most people are bored 
with themselves. They think that 
by traveling fast they can escape 
from themselves. After four or 
eight years of racing at 800 per, 
they find out they can’t escape after 
all, so they become resigned. Or, 
sometimes if they’re lucky enough 
to escape death, they begin to feel 
important after all. They aren’t so 


bored then because a part of their 
mind tells them they’re mightier 
than death.” 

Harry Hayden whistled. “Hey, I 
never heard that before. Is that in 
the tapes now? Can’t say I under- 
stand it too well, but it’s a fine idea. 
Anyway, Driving’s good. Cuts 
down on excess population, too — 
and with Peru putting in Jetways, 
it’s world-wide. Yep, by golly. Yes, 
sir!” 

He thrust a pen at Tom. “All 
right, boy. Just sign here.” 

Tom Rogers took the pen auto- 
matically. “You mean, I — ” 

“Yep, you came through your 
robot-training tests A-l. Oh, some 
of the psycho reports aren’t too flat- 
tering. Lack of confidence, sense of 
inferiority, inability to adjust. But 
nothing serious. A few weeks of 
Driving’ll fix you up. Yep, boy, 
you’ve passed. You’re getting your 
license. Tomorrow morning you’ll 
be on the Jetway. You’ll be Driv- 
ing, boy, Driving!” 

Oh Mother of God, Mother of 
God . 

“And now,” said Harry Hayden, 
“you’ll want to see your Hornet.” 
“Of course,” murmured Tom 
Rogers, swaying. 

The paunchy man rose and led 
Tom down an aluminite ramp and 
onto a small observation platform 
some ninety feet above the ground. 

A dry summer wind licked at 
Tom’s hair and stung his eyes. 
Nausea twisted at his innards. He 
felt as if he were perched on the 
edge of a slippery precipice. 

“There,” intoned Harry Hayden, 
“is the Jetway. Beautiful, eh?”

EDWARD W. LUDWIG 



“Uh-huh.” 

Trembling, Tom forced his 
vision to the bright, smooth canyon 
beneath him. Its bottom was a shin- 
ing white asphalt ribbon, a thou- 
sand feet wide, that cut arrow- 
straight through the city. Its walls 
were naked concrete banks a hun- 
dred feet high whose reinforced lips 
curved inward over the antiseptic 
whiteness. 

Harry Hayden pointed a chubby 
finger downward. “And there they 
are — the Hornets. See ’em, boy? 
Right there in front of the assembly 
shop. Twelve of ’em. Brand new 
DeLuxe Super-Jet ’41 Hornets. 
Yes, sir. Going to be twelve of you 
initiated tomorrow.” 

Tom scowled at the twelve jet- 
mobiles shaped like flattened tear- 
drops. No sunlight glittered on 
their dead-black bodies. They 
squatted silent and foreboding, ob- 
livious to sunlight, black bullets 
poised to hurl their prospective oc- 
cupants into fury and horror. 

Grandpa looked so very white in 
his coffin, so very dead — 

“What’s the matter, boy? You 
sick?” 

“N — no, of course not.” 

Harry Hayden laughed. “I get it. 
You thought you’d get to really 
see one. Get in it, I mean, try it 
out. It’s too late in the day, boy. 
Shop’s closing. You couldn’t drive 
one anyway. Regulation is that new 
drivers start in the morning when 
they’re fresh. But tomorrow morn- 
ing one of those Hornets’ll be as- 
signed to you. Delivered to the ter- 
minal nearest your home. Live far 
from your terminal?” 

“About four blocks.” 


“Half a minute on the mobile- 
walk. What college you go to?” 

“Western U.” 

“Lord, that’s 400 miles away. 
You been living there?” 

“No. Commuting every day on 
the monorail.” 

“Hell, that’s for old women. 
Must have taken you over an hour 
to get there. Now you’ll make it in 
almost thirty minutes. Still, it’s best 
to take it easy the first day. Don’t 
get ’er over 600 per. But don’t let 
’er fall beneath that either. If you 
do, some old veteran’ll know you’re 
a greenhorn and try to knock you 
off.” 

Suddenly Harry Hayden stiff- 
ened. 

“Here come a couple! Look at 
’em, boy!” 

The low rumbling came out of 
the west, as of angry bees. 

Twin pinpoints of black ap- 
peared on the distant white ribbon. 
Louder and louder the rumbling. 
Larger and larger the dots. To 
Tom, the sterile Jet way was trans- 
formed into a home of horror, an 
amphitheatre of death. 

Louder and larger — 

Brooommmmmm. 

Gone. 

“Hey, how’ja like that, boy? 
They’re gonna crack the sonic bar- 
rier or my name’s not Harry Hay- 
den!” 

Tom’s white-knuckled hands 
grasped a railing for support. 
Christ, I’m going to he sick. I’m 
going to vomit. 

“But wait’ll five o’clock or nine 
in the morning. That’s when you 
see the traffic. That’s when you 
really do some Driving!”

Tom gulped. “Is — is there a rest 
room here?” 

“What’s that, boy?” 

“A — a rest room.” 

“What’s the matter, boy? You do 
look sick. Too much excitement, 
maybe?” 

Tom motioned frantically. 

Harry Hayden pointed, slow 
comprehension crawling over his 
puffy features. “Up the ramp, to 
your right.” 

Tom Rogers made it just in 
time . 

Many voices : 

“Happy Driving to You, 

Happy Driving to You, 

Happy Driving, Dear Taaa- 
ahmmm — ” (pause) 

“Happy Driving to — ” (flourish) 
“—You!” 

An explosion of laughter. A de- 
scent of beaming faces, a thrusting 
forward of hands. 

Mom reached him first. Her 
small face was pale under its thin 
coat of make-up. Her firm, rounded 
body was like a girl’s in its dress of 
swishing Martian silk, yet her blue 
eyes were sad and her voice held a 
trembling fear: 

“You passed, Tom?” Softly. 

Tom’s upper lip twitched. Was 
she afraid that he’d passed the tests 
— or that he hadn’t! He wasn’t 
sure. 

Before he could answer, Dad 
broke in, hilariously. “Everybody 
passes these days excepts idiots and 
cripples!” 

Tom tried to join the chorus of 
laughter. 

76 


Dad said, more softly, “You did 
pass, didn’t you?” 

“I passed,” said Tom, forcing a 
smile. “But, Dad, I didn’t want a 
surprise party. Really, I — ” 

“Nonsense.” Dad straightened. 
“This is the happiest moment of 
our lives — or at least it should be.” 
Dad grinned. An understanding, 
intimate and gentle, flickered across 
his handsome, gray-thatched fea- 
tures. For an instant Tom felt that 
he was not alone. 

Then the grin faded. Dad re- 
sumed his role of proud and blus- 
tering father. Light glittered on his 
three rows of Driver’s Ribbons. The 
huge Blue Ribbon of Honor was in 
their center, like a blue flower in an 
evil garden of bronze accident stars, 
crimson fatality ribbons and silver 
death’s-heads. 

In a moment of desperation Tom 
turned to Mom. The sadness was 
still in her face, but it seemed over- 
shadowed by pride. What was it 
she’d once said? “It’s terrible, Tom, 
to think of your becoming a Driver, 
but it’d be a hundred times more 
terrible not to see you become one.” 
He knew now that he was alone, 
an exile, and Mom and Dad were 
strangers. After all, how could one 
person, entrenched in his own little 
world of calm security, truly know 
another’s fear and loneliness? 

“Just a little celebration,” Dad 
was saying. “You wouldn’t be a 
Driver unless we gave you a real 
send-off. All our friends are here, 
Tom. Uncle Mack and Aunt Edith 
and Bill Ackerman and Lou Dor- 
rance — ” 

No, Dad, Tom thought. Not our 
friends. Your friends. Don’t you re- 


EDWARD W. LUDWIG 



member that a man of twenty who 
isn’t a Driver has no friends? 

A lank, loose- jowled man jostled 
between them. Tom realized that 
Uncle Mack was babbling at him. 

“Knew you’d make it, Tom. 
Never believed what some people 
said ’bout you being afraid. My 
boy, of course, enlisted when he 
was only seventeen. Over thirty 
now, but he still Drives now and 
then. Got a special license, you 
know. Only last week — ” 

Dad exclaimed, “A toast to our 
new Driver!” 

Murmurs of delight. Clinkings of 
glasses. Gurglings of liquid. 

Someone bounded a piano chord. 
Voices rose: 

“A-Driving he will go, 
A-Driving he will go, 

To Hell and back in a coffin- 
sack 

A-Driving he will go.” 

Tom downed his glass of cham- 
pagne. A pleasant warmth filled his 
belly. A satisfying numbness dulled 
the raw ache of fear. 

He smiled bitterly. 

There was kindness and gentle- 
ness within the human heart, he 
thought, but like tiny inextinguish- 
able fires, there were ferocity and 
savageness, too. What else could 
one expect from a race only a few 
thousand years beyond the spear 
and stone axe? 

Through his imagination passed 
a parade of sombre scenes: 

The primitive man dancing 
about a Paleolithic fire, chanting an 
invocation to strange gods who 
might help in tomorrow’s battle 


with the hairy warriors from the 
South. 

The barrel-chested Roman gladi- 
ator, with trident and net, striding 
into the great stone arena. 

The silver-armored knight, 
gauntlet in gloved hand, riding 
into the pennant-bordered tourna- 
ment ground. 

The rock-shouldered fullback 
trotting beneath an avalanche of 
cheers into the 20th Century sta- 
dium. 

Men needed a challenge to their 
wits, a test for their strength. The 
urge to combat and the lust for 
danger was as innate as the desire 
for life. Who was he to say that the 
law of Driving was unjust? 

Nevertheless he shuddered. 

And the singers continued: 

“A thousand miles an hour, 

A thousand miles an hour, 
Angels cry and devils sigh 
At a thousand miles an 
hour . .” 


T HE JETMOBILE terminal was 
like a den of chained, growling 
black tigers. White-cloaked attend- 
ants scurried from stall to stall, deft 
hands flying over atomic-engine 
controls and flooding each vehicle 
with surging life. 

Ashen-faced, shivering in the 
early-morning coolness, Tom Rog- 
ers handed an identification slip to 
an attendant. 

“Okay, kid,” the rat-faced man 
wheezed, “there she is — Stall 17. 
Brand new, first time out. Good 
luck.” 

Tom stared in horror at the 

77 


THE DRIVERS 



grumbling metal beast. 

“But remember,” the attendant 
said, “don’t try to make a killing 
your first day. Most Drivers aren’t 
out to get a Ribbon every day 
either. They just want to get to 
work or school, mostly, and have 
fun doing it.” 

Have fun doing it, thought Tom. 
Good God. 

About him passed other black- 
uniformed Drivers. They paused at 
the heads of their stalls, donned 
crash-helmets and safety belts, ad- 
justed goggles. They were like 
primitive warriors, like cocky Ro- 
man gladiators, like armored 
knights, like star fullbacks. They 
were formidable and professional. 

Tom’s imagination wandered. 

By Jupiter's beard , we'll van- 
quish Attila and his savages. We'll 
prove ourselves worthy of being 
men and Romans . The Red 
Knight? I vow , Mother , that his 
blood alone shall know the sting of 
the lance . Don't worry, Dad. 
Those damned Japs dnd Germans 
won't lay a hand on me . Watch 
me on TV, folks. Three touch- 
downs today — 1 promise! 

The attendant’s voice snapped 
him back to reality. “What you 
waiting for, kid? Get in!” 

Tom’s heart pounded. He felt 
the hot pulse of blood in his tem- 
ples. 

The Hornet lay beneath him like 
an open, waiting coffin. 

He swayed. 

“Hi, Tom!” a boyish voice 
called. “Bet I beat ya!” 

Tom blinked and beheld a small- 
boned, tousled-haired lad of seven- 
teen striding past the stall. What 


was his name? Miles. That was it. 
Larry Miles. A frosh at Western U. 

A skinny, pimply-faced boy sud- 
denly transformed into a black- 
garbed warrior. How could this be? 

“Okay,” Tom called, biting his 
lip. 

He looked again at the Hornet. 
A giddiness returned to him. 

You can say you’re sick, he told 
himself. It’s happened before: a 
hangover from the party. Sure. To- 
morrow you’ll feel better. If you 
could just have one more day, just 
one — 

Other Hornets were easing out 
into the slip, sleek black cats em- 
barking on an insane flight. One 
after another, grumbling, growling, 
spatting scarlet flame from their tail 
jets. 

Perhaps if he waited a few min- 
utes, the traffic would be thinner. 
He could have coffee, let the other 
nine-o’clock people go on ahead of 
him. 

No, dammit, get it over with . If 
you crash, you crash. If you die, 
you die. You and Grandpa and a 
million others . 

He gritted his teeth, fighting the 
omnipresent giddiness. He eased his 
body down into the Hornet’s cock- 
pit. He felt the surge of incredible 
energies beneath the steelite con- 
trols. Compared to this vehicle, the 
ancient training jets were as chil- 
dren’s toys. 

An attendant snapped down the 
plexite canopy. Ahead, a guide- 
master twirled a blue flag in a start- 
ing signal. 

Tom flicked on a switch. His 
trembling hands tightened about 
the steering lever. The Hornet 


78 


EDWARD W. LUDWIG 



lunged forward, quivering as it was 
seized by the Jetway’s electromag- 
netic guide-field. 

He drove . 

One hundred miles an hour, two 
hundred, three hundred. 

Down the great asphalt valley he 
drove. Perspiration formed inside 
his goggles, steaming the glass. He 
tore them off. The glaring white- 
ness hurt his eyes. 

Swish, swish swish. 

Jetmobiles roared past him. The 
rushing wind of their passage buf- 
feted his own car. His hands were 
knuckled white around the steer- 
ing lever. 

He recalled the advice of Harry 
Hayden: Don’t let ’er under 600 
per. If you do, some old veteran’ll 
know you’re a greenhorn and try to 
knock you off. 

Lord. Six hundred. 

But strangely, a measure of des- 
perate courage crept into his fear- 
clouded mind. If Larry Miles, a 
pimply-faced kid of seventeen, 
could do it, so could he. Certainly, 
he told himself. 

His foot squeezed down on 
the accelerator. Atomic engines 
hummed smoothly. 

To his right, he caught a kaleido- 
scopic glimpse of a white gyro- 
ambulance. A group of metal beasts 
lay huddled on the emergency strip 
like black ants feeding on a carcass. 

Like Grandfather , he thought. 
Like those two moments out of the 
dark past , moments of screaming 
flame and black death and a child’s 
horror . 

Swish. 

The scene was gone, transformed 


into a cluster of black dots on his 
rear-vision radarscope. 

His stomach heaved. For a mo- 
ment he thought he was going to 
be sick again. 

But stronger now than his hor- 
ror was a growing hatred of that 
horror. His body tensed as if he 
were fighting a physical enemy. He 
fought his memories, tried to thrust 
them back into the oblivion of lost 
time, tried to leave them behind 
him just as his Hornet had left the 
cluster of metal beasts. 

He took a deep breath. He was 
not going to be sick after all. 

Five hundred now. Six hundred. 
He’d reached the speed without 
realizing it. Keep ’er steady. Stay 
on the right. If Larry Miles can do 
it, So can you. 

Swooommmm . 

God, where did that one come 
from? 

Only ten minutes more. You’ll be 
there. You’ll make a right hand 
turn at the college. The automatic 
pilot’ll take care of that. You won’t 
have to get in the fast traffic lanes. 

He wiped perspiration from his 
forehead. Not so bad, these Drivers. 
Like Harry Hayden said, the killers 
come out on Saturdays and Sun- 
days. Now, most of us are just anx- 
ious to get to work and school. 

Six hundred, seven hundred, 
seven-twenty — 

Did he dare tackle the sonic bar- 
rier? 

The white asphalt was like 
opaque mist. The universe seemed 
to consist only of the broad expanse 
of Jetway. 

Swooommmm. 

Someone passing even at this 

79 


THE DRIVERS 



speed! The crazy fool! And cutting 
in, the flame of his exhaust cloud- 
ing Tom’s windshield! 

Tom’s foot jerked off the accel- 
erator. His Hornet slowed. The car 
ahead disappeared into the white 
distance like a black arrow. 

Whew! 

His legs were suddenly like ice 
water. He pulled over to the emer- 
gency strip. Down went the speed- 
ometer — five hundred, four, three, 
two, one, zero . 

He saw the image of the ap- 
proaching Hornet in his rear-vision 
radarscope. It was traveling fast 
and heading straight toward him. 
Heading onto the emergency strip. 

A side-swiper! 

Tom’s heart churned. There 
would be no physical contact be- 
tween the two Hornets — but the 
torrent of air from the inch-close 
passage would be enough to hurl 
his car into the Jetway bank like a 
storm-blown leaf. 

There was no time to build 
enough acceleration for escape. His 
only chance was to frighten the at- 
tacker away. He swung his Hornet 
right, slammed both his accelera- 
tion and braking jet controls to full 
force. The car shook under the 
sudden release of energy. White- 
hot flame roared from its two dozen 
jets. Tom’s Hornet was enclosed by 
a sphere of flame. 

But dwarfing the roar was the 
thunder of the attacking Hornet. A 
black meteor in Tom’s radarscope, 
it zoomed upon him. Tom closed 
his eyes, braced himself for the im- 
pact. 

There was no impact. There was 
only an explosion of sound and a 


moderate buffeting of his car. It 
was as if many feet, not inches, had 
separated the two Hornets. 

Tom opened his eyes and flicked 
off his jet controls. 

Ahead, through the plexite can- 
opy, he beheld the attacker. 

It was far away now, like an in- 
sane, fiery black bird. Both its ac- 
celeration and braking jets flamed. 
It careened to the far side of the 
Jetway and zig-zagged up the 
curved embankment. Its body 
trembled as its momentum fought 
the Jetway’s electromagnetic guide- 
field. 

As if in an incredible carnival 
loop-the-loop, the Hornet topped 
the lip of the wall. It left the con- 
crete, did a backward somersault, 
and gyrated through space like a 
flaming pinwheel. 

It descended with an earth-shak- 
ing crash in the center of the 
gleaming Jet way. 

What happened? Tom’s dazed 
mind screamed. In God’s name, 
what happened? 

He saw the sleek white shape of 
a Referee’s ’copter-jet floating to 
the pavement beside him. Soon he 
was being pulled out of his Hornet. 
Someone was pumping his hand 
and thumping his back. 

“Magnificent,” a voice was say- 
ing. “Simply magnificent!” 

Night. Gay laughter and tinkling 
glasses. Above all. Dad’s voice, 
strong and proud: 

“. and on his very first day, 
too. He saw the car in his rear 
radarscope, guessed what the devil 
was up to. Did he try to escape? 
No, he stayed right there. When 


80 


EDWARD W. LUDWIG 



the car closed in for the kill, he 
spiin around and turned on all his 
jets full-blast. The killer never had 
a chance to get close enough to do 
his side-swiping. The blast roasted 
him like a peanut.” 

Dad put his arm around Tom’s 
shoulder. All eyes seemed upon 
Tom’s bright new crimson fatality 
ribbon embossed not only with a 
silver death’s-head, but also with a 
sea-blue Circle of Honor. 

Tom thought: 

Behold the conquering hero . At - 
tila is vanquished and Rome is 
saved . The Red Knight has been 
defeated , and the fair princess is 
mine. That Jap Zero didn’t have a 
chance . A touchdown in the final 
five seconds of the fourth quarter — 
not bad y eh? 

Dad went on : 

“That devil really was a killer. 
Fellow name of Wilson. Been Driv- 
ing for six years. Had thirty-three 
accident ribbons with twenty-one 
fatalities — not one of them honor- 
able. That Wilson drove for just 
one purpose: to kill. He met his 
match in our Tom Rogers.” 

Applause from Uncle Mack and 
Aunt Edith and Bill Ackerman and 
Lou Dorrance — and more impor- 
tant, from young Larry Miles and 
big Norm Powers and blonde Ger- 
aldine Oliver and cute little Sally 
Peters. 


Tom smiled. Not only your 
friends tonight, Dad. Tonight it’s 
my friends, too. My friends from 
Western U. 

Fame was as unpredictable as 
the trembling of a leaf, Tom 
thought, as delicate as a pillar of 
glass. Yet the yoke of fame rested 
pleasantly on his shoulders. He had 
no inclination to dislodge it. And 
while a fear was still in him, it was 
now a fragile thing, an egg shell to 
be easily crushed. 

Later Mom came to him. There 
was a proudness in her features, 
and yet a sadness and a fear, too. 
Her eyes held the thoughtful hesi- 
tancy of one for whom time and 
event have moved too swiftly for 
comprehension. 

“Tomorrow’s Saturday,” she 
murmured. “There’s no school, and 
no one’ll expect you to Drive after 
what happened today. You’ll be 
staying home for your birthday, 
won’t you, Tom?” 

Tom Rogers shook his head. 
“No,” he said wistfully. “Sally 
Peters is giving a little party over 
in New Boston. It’s the first time 
anyone like Sally ever asked me 
anywhere.” 

“I see,” said Mom, as if she real- 
ly didn’t see at all. “You’ll take the 
monorail?” 

“No, Mom,” Tom answered very 
softly. “I’m Driving.” • • •

"rp HIS/’ SAID chief Van Isaac, 

JL “is our new trouble spot,” 
The older man’s rodlike finger 
probed decisively at a violet dot 
placed on a thin yellow line of a 
circle, third out from a sun. Other 
dots peppered the giant glazed star 
map, companions of which hung 
on the other three walls of the 
chamber. “Valaya is the name of 
the place,” Van Isaac continued. 
“Perhaps you know something 
about it.” 

“Not much,” said the other, a 
thirtyish, lean man by the name of 
Arnold Koven. “I mean, not a 
great deal besides what the telefilms 
have screamed for the past two 
weeks. Revolution, slaughter, tribe 
against tribe.” Koven placed a 
cigarette between his lips, and his 
eyes smiled with gentle cynicism. 
“Valaya has a creole sound.” 

“You’ll have no vacation, believe

peopled largely by residents of the

“The raids are the combined

“The Hog, yes. He is a citizen of

Valaya, with headquarters at the 
village of Maru. But the attacks 
date from two weeks after he ar- 
rived. So,” said Van Isaac, tone 
hardening, “I know he is undoubt- 
edly behind all this, and I want 
him stopped.” 

“Any G. G. I. A. men around 
Maru?” Koven inquired. 

“The local agent for the con- 
tinent, named Spot wood. He says 
Bruschloss has conversed privately 
with the local ruler. Spotwood 
couldn’t plant cameras or sound 
equipment at the conferences — our 
own blasted code forbids it. But 
the rub is that the ruler has in no 
way communicated with any of the 
other tribes on North. In no way ” 
Van Isaac repeated, with a fist on 
the desk for emphasis. “They have 
drums. The drums say nothing 
Spotwood can’t understand. All 
perfectly innocent. They have run- 
ners. No runners. No flare signals. 
No secret meetings. Spotwood has 
hired three or four dozen breeds to 
do his spying, but he has absolutely 
no idea of how the ruler manages 
to organize the other tribes into 
these precise, well-timed, well-gen- 
eraled raids across the strait.” 

“I’m to find out?” asked Koven. 
“And stop the proceedings?” 

“Exactly. Spotwood’s good, but 
• • • 

At the spaceport, Koven pushed 
his way through the jabbering 
crowd, checked his baggage onto 
the Valaya flight, had coffee, and 
got something to read from a 
Vendobook. He chose a volume en- 
titled The Twilight of Meaning- 


ism, by Dr. Reywill of Memphis 
University. As the long iron dagger 
of the rocket cut burning through 
the blue curtain of the sky, he 
settled down in his compartment to 
read. 

Dr. Reywill’s work turned out to 
be an historical analysis of the 
forces which, toward the end of the 
twentieth century, catalyzed the 
arts into pure sensation, utterly de- 
void of meaning or communication. 
During the middle of that century, 
with poetry restricted to the hands 
of the few who wailed that their 
mechanized age did not understand 
them, poetry became exceedingly 
private in imagery and meaning. In 
a natural evolution, it completely 
lost all meaning and became a 
charming musical form several cuts 
above the primitive. When the 
masses found they could merely 
accept verse as a pleasantry whose 
sound intrigued them as a rattle 
intrigues a child, poetry, regained 
its audience. The same condition 
held true for music, the dance, 
painting and sculpture. To Koven, 
born when Meaningism was two 
hundred years dead, the notion 
that a poem could say something 
seemed quaint and even a trifle 
peculiar. 

Twenty-eight hours later Koven 
landed in Maru, knowing a good 
deal more about the history of con- 
temporary poetry, but knowing 
nothing which would help him un- 
ravel the puzzle of the raids.

“The colonization board worked

Valaya over from one end to the 
other. This is genuine, authentic 
and otherwise real tropicana.” 

Koven stood at the window of 
Spotwood’s shack, which looked 
down a long street to the central 
clearing which formed the cross- 
roads of Maru. Bluish sky spread 
out overhead like sheets of hot 
metal, and the almost poisonously 
colorful foliage stuttered gendy in 
a hot breeze. The nearly undressed 
inhabitants, skins belying only a 
touch of the bluish blood from 
Mars, idled along from hut to hut, 
talking or playing with the chil- 
dren. The only note of turmoil was 
sounded by the slapping skin drums 
from the far side of the village. 
Koven turned around to his host. 

“Are they beating the drums for 
any purpose ?” he wanted to know. 

Spotwood took a drink from a 
sanitary plastic bubble. “Once a 
month everybody on North gets to- 
gether for a shindig.” He smirked 
with good-natured lasciviousness. 
“The whole rigamarole is years old. 
Guarantees that plenty of good 
strong babies will be born, and that 
the crops won’t fail, or some such 
rot. O’ course,” Spotwood said 
laconically, “this monthly assembly 
would be the logical time to sus- 
pect, if they ever did anything but 
put on a sexual exhibition in that 
clearing down the road. Maybe,” 
he added, “the head dancer’s pelvis 
— a female, by the way — is tattooed 
with a message in some sort of in- 
visible ink our poor old Earth eyes 
can’t see. Her belly gyrations would 
guarantee high readership, if noth- 
ing else.” 

Koven smiled thinly, as a knock 


rattled on the slatted door. 

Spotwood’s eyes slitted down and 
jumped briefly to Koven’s, in a 
glance which the latter interpreted 
to read, News isn’t slow in Maru. 
I’ll bet this is the prime mover. 
Koven instinctively patted the flat 
pistol beneath his coat, his back to 
the door as Spotwood opened it. 

“I understand we have a visitor 
in the village,” came the sound of 
an unpleasant, wet and wheezing 
voice. 

“You’re right,” said Spotwood. 
“Come on in, Bruschloss.” 

Molding his face into a careful 
expression of relaxed disinterest, 
Koven turned around to face The 
Hog, 

Bruschloss extended a pink gobby 
hand. “Koven, did you say? I’m al- 
ways delighted to see anyone here 
with Earth blood in his veins.” He 
laughed self-consciously, and the 
rolling folds of his belly quivered. 
“Even though we are on opposite 
sides of the political fence we can 
still be friends, I hope. You arrived 
at a good time. Tonight’s the cele- 
bration.” He seemed to breathe 
more quickly at the thought; he 
savored the words like a man 
aroused by a fetish. 

“Spotwood’s been telling me,” 
Koven said. 

“Has he, eh? He enjoys them too, 
I’ll wager.” No reply from Spot- 
wood, save the pop of another gin 
globe being opened. 

“Have a drink, Bruschloss?” 
Spotwood asked. 

“No, 1 don’t think so. Liquor 
makes me very sleepy. I want to be 
alert for the ceremony tonight. I 
love to watch Chemin dance.” 


SHANGO 


85 



“Quite a woman,” Spotwood 
agreed. 

“Er . what is your line of busi- 
ness?” inquired Bruschloss of 
Koven, elevating the wrinkles on 
his steaming forehead into an ex- 
pression of curiosity. 

“I came to help Jimmy finish up 
in a hurry.” 

“Trying to discover whether you 
might seed Valaya for platinum?” 
asked Bruschloss with perfect in- 
nocence. 

Spotwood snickered. “What’s the 
matter with you, Bruschloss? Are 
you sure you haven’t had a drink? 
You know it’s petro I’m after.” 

“Of course! I am stupid, forgive 
me.” A self-conscious pause en- 
sued, while no one spoke. Then 
Bruschloss, as if snatching at any 
clue that might tell him more about 
the visitor to Maru, spied Koven’ s 
book, slung carelessly along with his 
other gear on the deal table. “A 
book!” exclaimed The Hog, rolling 
forward. “Mr. Koven, it delights 
me to find a literate man in this 
wilderness.” He turned a few pages, 
leaving black sweaty thumb prints 
on the thin plastic leaves. 

“The disappearance of meaning 
from poetry, eh?” he said, snapping 
the book closed. “I must read it 
some time, if you’ll lend it.” 

Koven said he would, and 
Bruschloss made a quick exit. He 
seemed to do things in opposites. 
First he had been straining to re- 
main and keep conversation alive. 
Last, he had been straining to leave 
as rapidly as possible. In spite of 
the man’s slovenly appearance, 
Koven knew he had a dangerous 
enemy. Bruschloss would have had 


to be an utter moron to believe that 
Koven had come to Maru simply to 
aid Spotwood. Spotwood himself, 
as if sensing Koven’s appraisal of 
the man from the Betelgeuse Bloc, 
spoke : 

“Watch him. He’s got three 
uglies up at his place who do noth- 
ing all day but drink and play 
cards. They’re here in case of trou- 
ble.” 

Koven smiled thinly. “I hope we 
can accommodate them.” 

Toward the end of the sixteen- 
hour-day, after Spotwood had pre- 
pared dinner from food cubes, 
Koven decided to take a stroll 
around the village. The citizens 
hardly gave him a glance, en- 
grossed in eating within their 
houses. From glimpses Koven 
caught, they hardly looked like a 
warlike crew, and yet he had read 
the tales of atrocities committed 
across the strait on South, and he 
felt a crawly sensation on his spine. 
Tonight, perhaps, plans would be 
laid for the next attack, while he 
knew nothing about the process 
which would probably go on right 
around him. Certainly the people 
of Valaya weren’t ’paths. He knew 
that much. 

Koven crossed the central clear- 
ing and turned left toward the vil- 
lage fringe. He passed the final few 
dwellings and turned left again, up 
a slight wooded rise, back across 
which he could reach Spotwood’s 
house. As he crossed the spine of 
the ridge, he thought he noticed a 
movement along to his right, and 
turned in that direction. He caught 
sight of an arm arching for-

ward, and a small circular object 
spiraling down toward his head 
through the spicy air. Instinctively 
trained, Koven pumped his legs 
and slid out forward along the 
ground, rolling, watching the ob- 
ject go spinning crazily by against 
the darkening heavens. He ex- 
tended an arm, caught a tree and 
jerked himself around into the pro- 
tection of its thick trunk as a flat 
explosion tore the air and smashed 
his eardrums. He closed his eyes 
tightly. The blazing white flash 
lasted only a second. 

Struggling up, he had time only 
to see the scooped-out pit along the 
spine’s crest, smoking like a raw 
wound, where the bomb had struck. 
Boots bit earth, coming in his di- 
rection at a dead run. Koven 
crouched in tree shadow, hoping 
that his adversary had not seen him 
scramble to safety in the illusive 
light on the hill. He snaked the flat 
pistol free of its casing just as the 
attacker broke through a clump of 
brush. Koven had a fleeting im- 
pression of massive size, a meaty 
face and short spiky dark hair. 
Then he was on his feet, charging 
against his enemy, who abruptly 
saw him and ground to a halt. 

The attacker’s mouth made a red 
startled O, and one heavy hand 
labored to bring up a heavy pistol. 
But Koven had already fired. The 
pale thin beam lanced out in com- 
plete silence. The enemy dropped 
his weapon but had no time to ut- 
ter a sound. The skin of his head 
began to blacken and fall away in 
charring strips. Koven always felt 
relieved when a man shot like that 
fell, for he did not have to look at 


the bubbling horror of burning 
flesh and gristle. 

Swinging around, Koven scruti- 
nized the village. No clamor, no 
outcry had been made. The central 
street overflowed now, for the short 
night had nearly begun, and 
torches began to flare, throwing up 
great roiling shadows on the trees 
as the crowd babbled and pressed 
down to the main clearing. 

Why in the name of sense had 
the attack come now? at this pre- 
cise moment? Spotwood had been 
in Maru for months, and had said 
nothing about any sort of attack 
on him. Certainly Bruschloss sus- 
pected Spotwood. All men from 
Earth had to be suspect here, to a 
man from the Betelgeuse Bloc. 
Therefore something about himself 
which, offhand, he couldn’t pin- 
point, had driven The Hog far 
enough into fear to send this at- 
tacker. 

This point Spotwood verified 
after Koven jogged back to the 
house at a run. Spotwood scratched 
his chin and whistled. “Why the 
blazes is he after you right away?” 
Spotwood asked. 

“I’m wondering the same.” 

“He must think you’ve found out 
how he organizes the raids.” 

“That’s the hell of it. I haven’t.” 
From the central clearing came 
a staccato increase in the tempo of 
the drumming. Spotwood swiveled 
around, listening, while Koven con- 
tinued to scowl dismally at the 
floor. Spotwood snagged a light 
coat from the comer and slipped 
into it. “They’ll be starting in a 
minute. Come on.” Once again he 
managed to grin. “You don’t want 


SHANGO 


87 



to miss Chemin. They call the 
dance a shango. I often wince when 
I think what a pastor would call 
it.” 

Koven followed Spotwood from 
the shanty, and they trudged down 
the blue-lit street toward the sway- 
ing mob in the clearing. Koven 
quickly outlined a few facts to his 
companion. They must pretend not 
to notice the surprise on the face of 
Bruschloss, which would certainly 
be present when Koven turned up 
alive. Moreover, Koven made it 
clear that they should not even look 
the least suspiciously in The Hog’s 
direction. 

“Tough order,” Spotwood of- 
fered. “Bruschloss sees you alive, he 
knows you probably saw, and 
killed, the man who tried to get 
you. He figures you described the 
killer to me, and also figures I 
pegged him down for you as one of 
his assistants.” 

“Still, let’s try to bluff it out.” 

They pressed through the edges 
of the crowd, ignored, for the 
watchers concentrated upon the 
figures diving and turning and 
stamping their feet on the earth in 
the center of the ring, clad in 
feathers and little else, skins shining 
and polished by sweat in the bub- 
bling light of the ghastly blue flares. 
Spotwood shouldered off to stand a 
fair distance away, and Koven 
found a slight break in the crowd 
and crouched down on his 
haunches, stabbing a cigarette into 
his mouth. From the rear of the cir- 
cle a young girl appeared, very 
beautiful, with a tuft of feathers at 
her hip, and her breasts oiled and 
glowing like metal cones. Koven 

88 


gathered this was Chemin, for the 
name passed on many tongues. A 
circle of male dancers closed 
around her. 

Koven kept his head straight 
front, but moved his eyes in their 
sockets, so that he could see Brusch- 
loss, backed up by two men with 
thick shoulders standing directly 
behind. The trio blurred almost out 
of sight at the edge of Koven’ s line 
of vision. Bruschloss sat bent for- 
ward, his rolled belly heaving, and 
the sweaty, stubbled skin of his face 
looking rotted in the blue light. He 
followed each movement of the 
dancer Chemin with obscene con- 
centration, but Koven, switching 
his eyes front, had the unpleasant 
feeling that the two burly com- 
panions were scrutinizing him. 

Chemin’s dance became less sex- 
ual for a few moments, became the 
sort of dance you might almost ex- 
pect to see on a photovision variety 
hour ; a dance without specific 
meaning. 

Abruptly the palms of Koven’s 
hands felt wet. 

He lurched to his feet and 
searched the crowd for Spotwood. 
The crowd seemed intensely quiet 
during Chemin’s performance. 
Each man had his eyes riveted to 
the flying hands and undulating 
body of the girl in the center. 
Koven inched his way free of the 
crowd, still keeping watch on the 
dance. He just broke from the 
edges as Chemin disappeared into 
the darkness from which she had 
come, and pairs of males and fe- 
males, with sharp, biting cries, be- 
gan again the ritual. 

With a throbbing in his nerves 

JOHN JAKES 



that always came when he was very 
close to something he worked for, 
Koven cut around a series of huts 
in time to see the girl Chemin dis- 
appear into one of them. Looking 
left and right, seeing no one except 
the crowd at the rear of the hut 
forming this edge of the ring, he 
eased out the pistol and stepped 
through the hangings. 

Chemin sat with her head resting 
wearily on her arms, as if the danc- 
ing had drained her last reserve of 
energy. The light scuff of Koven’s 
shoes on dirt caused her to whip 
her head up, and he realized again 
how attractive she was, in spite of 
the perspiration filming her body 
and the tired haggardness of her 
features. 

“Don’t make a single sound,” he 
warned. “FU fire.” 

Gradually the spasmodic quiver- 
ing in her throat subsided. “You 
are the new man here with Spot- 
wood,” she said, frightened. 

Koven nodded. “I came to find 
out how Bruschloss organized the 
attacks on South, through your 
ruler.” The Hog’s name washed 
the light of truth for a moment into 
her eyes, and Koven pressed on, 
sure. “We didn’t know how the 
plans for attack were circulated on 
this continent. But you’ve been giv- 
ing the plans, out there in the ring. 
That solo dance had a meaning.” 

“Fertility . .” she began. 

“Oh, no. Before and after it, yes. 
But the women paid no attention 
to your solo dance. The men did. 
They were attentive. They were 
waiting for and receiving orders, 
weren’t they? Orders your ruler 
had to give through a dance, be- 


cause Spotwood was here, and you 
couldn’t dare give them in a way 
he might understand.” 

“You are wrong.” 

Koven stepped forward and 
pressed the pistol against Chemin’s 
breast. In the badly-lit tent he 
could still see the flesh of that 
breast harden. “Am I wrong?” 

A tiny tongue caressed her lips 
in anxiety. “What are you going to 
do with me?’ 

“Do you have more to tell 
them?” 

“No, I . .” 

“Tell the truth.” The pistol muz- 
zle ground an ugly white pit in her 
flesh. 

“Yes, I have more.” 

“When you dance, tell the people 
to kill Bruschloss and his two men, 
immediately. Orders from your 
ruler. Bruschloss is a traitor, tell 
them.” 

Aghast: “I could not . .” 
“Would you rather die?” 

“The ruler will know . .” 

“You show me where he is sit- 
ting. I’ll take care of him. If you 
should give the wrong message 
when you dance ... if they should 
turn on me, I’ll still manage to kill 
you before they get me. So it’s en- 
tirely up to you whether you live 
or die.” He recognized acceptance 
in her bowed neck. “I want you to 
show me how the dance works. 
Show me the motions, the gestures 
you use to explain plans for the at- 
tack.” 

Chemin gazed obliquely at him 
with tormented eyes. Then she 
crossed her wrists and moved her 
fingers in a fluttering motion. “This 
is the sign for a small peninsula 


SHANGO 


89 



south of here, on the strait. This 
. .” She pantomimed again. “. 
is the sign which means meeting 
place. This . .” And so she re- 
hearsed the various signals, and 
then the message Koven had issued, 
while he kept his pistol trained on 
her. He knew now what had 
alarmed Bruschloss, what had 
prompted the attack so suddenly. 

C HEMIN DANCED, in the ring 
again. Koven stood almost di- 
rectly behind the ruler, fitting a 
tiny cylindrical attachment to the 
muzzle of his pistol, to reduce the 
power for close range. Once more 
the men glued their eyes on the 
dancing figure. Seconds after the 
dance had begun, the ruler uttered 
a sharp gasp and lurched up from 
his woven chair as he read the new 
message. Koven’s hand touched 
him and he stepped around the 
chair in the darkness. Koven slid 
the pistol forward and triggered it. 
Only a faint white glow showed 
flush against the belly of the ruler. 
With the smell of burned flesh eat- 
ing in his nostrils, Koven lowered 
the ruler’s body to the ground. The 
crowd to either side had surged for- 
ward slightly, beginning to talk 
curiously now, paying no attention 
to Koven. Across the ring, Brusch- 
loss blinked and gestured sweatily, 
while his two assistants closed in 
tight against his shoulders. The 
drums slapped in a frenzy. 

Koven saw a man break from the 
edge of the ring and lurch across 
toward Bruschloss. Chemin stopped 
her dance, collapsing to her knees. 
One of Bruschloss’ men shot the 

90 


first attacker, but by then the 
crowd had broken, and men boiled 
forward, and Koven heard The 
Hog’s scream as a sea of writhing 
backs and arms and legs closed 
over him. The sounds were grue- 
some. 

Koven turned and raced up the 
long street to Spot wood’s house. 
The seemingly careless agent reeled 
in moments later, to hear Koven 
finishing at the communicator set: 
“. that’s right, two Control 
squads. And for God’s sake make it 
within twenty minutes, before they 
decide to massacre us.” He threw 
down a switch and swung around 
on the stool, grinning lopsidedly. 
Down the long avenue echoed 
screams, and an angry mob shout- 
ing. 

“Bang! Like that!” Spotwood 
breathed. “What the hell hap- 
pened?” 

Koven sketched it quickly. 

“You knew,” Spotwood said in 
astonishment, pointing to the table, 
“because of that book you hap- 
pened to read?” 

Koven nodded. “The arts no 
longer convey meaning, but the 
ruler of Maru managed to put it 
back in. Something you didn’t look 
for. Something I wouldn’t have 
looked for ... if I hadn’t stopped 
at a Vendobook.” 

“You think they’ll come after 
us?” Spotwood asked. 

Koven glanced out the window. 
At the street’s end, pieces of some- 
thing meaty and red had been 
hoisted up by the crowd on long, 
sharp poles. They glistened in the 
flaring light. 

“They may. They’re in a wild 

JOHN JAKES 



mood. Once Control takes over, pistol from the cupboard, and they 
though, the attacks will be a thing sat down to wait, 
of the past. But until then . .” Twenty-three minutes later ’cop- 

“Holy God,” Spotwood breathed, ters were snarling across the night 
He went toward a cupboard, over the village, and beams cut 
stopped at the table and glanced swathes back and forth over a sea 
down. Nearly in awe, he read of tossing bluish faces. Spotwood 
aloud, “The Twilight of Meaning - stood up with a sigh, stretched and 
ism . Mph.” An emphatic shake of took down two gin bubbles, saying 
the head. Then he unlimbered a to Koven, “Have a drink.” • • •

THE 


marsfenes 



T HERE IS a small striped smelt 
called the grunion which has 
odd egglaying habits. At high tide, 
on the second, third, and fourth 
nights after the full of the moon 
from March to June, thousands of 
female grunions ride in on the 
waves to a beach in southern Cali- 
fornia near San Diego, dig tail-first 
into the soft sand, deposit their 
eggs, then ride back on the wash of 
the next wave. The whole oper- 
ation lasts about six seconds. 

On the nights when the grunion 
are running, hordes of people used 


to come to the beach with baskets 
and other containers, and with 
torches to light the scene, and try 
to catch the elusive little fish in 
their hands. 

They were doing that on an 
April night in 1960. In the midst 
of the excitement of the chase, only 
a few of them noticed that some- 
thing else was riding the waves in 
with the grunions. 

Among the few who stopped 
grunion-catching long enough to 
investigate were a girl named 
Marge Hickin and a boy named 


BY MIRIAM ALLEN DE FORD

Gene To wanda. They were UCLA 
students, “going together”, who 
had come down on Saturday from 
Los Angeles for the fun. 

“What on earth do you think 
these can be, Gene?” Marge asked, 
holding out on her palms three or 
four of the little circular, wriggling 
objects, looking like small-size 
doughnuts, pale straw in color. 

“Never saw anything like them,” 
Gene admitted. “But then my ma- 
jor’s psychology, not zoology. They 
don’t seem to bite, anyway. Here 
let’s collect some of them instead of 
the fish. That dingus of yours will 
hold water. We can take them to 
the Marine Biology lab tomorrow 
and find out what they are.” 

Marge Hickin and Gene To- 
wanda had started a world-wide 
economic revolution. 

„ None of the scientists at the uni- 
versity laboratory knew what the 
little live straw-colored circles were, 
either. In fact, after a preliminary 
study they wouldn’t say positively 
whether the creatures were animal 
or vegetable ; they displayed volun- 
tary movement, but they seemed to 
have no respiratory or digestive 
organs. They were completely an- 
omalous. 

The grunion ran again that 
night, and Gene and Marge stayed 
down to help the laboratory assis- 
tants gather several hundred of the 
strange new objects for further 
study. They were so numerous that 
they were swamping the fish, and 
the crowds at the beach began to 
grumble that their sport was being 
spoiled. 

Next night the grunion stopped 
running — but the little doughnuts 


didn’t. They never stopped. They 
came in by hundreds of thousands 
every night, and those which no- 
body gathered wriggled their way 
over the land until some of them 
even turned up on the highways 
(where a lot of them were smashed 
by automobiles), on the streets and 
sidewalks of La Jolla, and as far 
north as Oceanside and as far south 
as downtown San Diego itself. 

The things were becoming a pest. 
There were indigant letters to the 
papers, and editorials were written 
calling on the authorities to do 
something. Just what to do, nobody 
knew; the only way to kill the cir- 
cular little objects from the sea 
seemed to be to crush them — and 
they were too abundant for that 
to be very effective. 

Meanwhile, the laboratory kept 
studying them. 

Marge and Gene were interested 
enough to come down again the 
next week-end to find out what, if 
anything, had been discovered. Not 
much had: but one of the bio- 
chemists at the laboratory casually 
mentioned that chemically the 
straw-colored circles seemed to be 
almost pure protein, with some 
carbohydrates and fats, and that 
apparently they contained all the 
essential vitamins. 

College student that he was, 
Gene To wanda immediately swal- 
lowed one of the wriggling things 
down whole, as a joke. 

It tickled a little, but that wasn’t 
what caused the delighted amaze- 
ment on his face. 

“Gosh!” he exclaimed. “It’s de- 
licious!” 

He swallowed another handful.

That was the beginning of the 
great margene industry. 

It was an astute reporter, get- 
ting a feature story on the sen- 
sational new food find, who gave 
the creatures their name, in honor 
of the boy and girl who had first 
brought the things to the attention 
of the scientists. He dubbed them 
margenes, and margenes they re- 
mained. 

“Dr. O. Y. Willard, director of 
the laboratory,” his story said in 
part, “thinks the margenes may be 
the answer to the increasing and 
alarming problem of malnutrition, 
especially in undeveloped coun- 
tries. 

“ ‘For decades now,* he said, 
‘scientists have been worried by 
the growing gap between world 
population and world food facil- 
ities. Over-farming, climatic 
changes caused by erosion and de- 
forestation, the encroachment of 
building areas on agricultural land, 
and above all the unrestricted 
growth of population, greatest in 
the very places where food is be- 
coming scarcest and most expensive, 
have produced a situation where, 
if no remedy is found, starvation 
or semi-starvation may be the fate 
of half the Earth’s people. The 
ultimate result would be the slow 
degeneration and death of the en- 
tire human race. 

“ ‘Many remedies have been sug- 
gested,’ Dr. Willard commented 
further. ‘They range from compul- 
sory birth control to the produc- 
tion of synthetic food, hydroponics, 
and the harvesting of plankton 
from the oceans. Each of these pre- 
sents almost insuperable difficulties. 


“ ‘The one ideal solution would 
be the discovery of some universal 
food that would be nourishing, 
very cheap, plentiful, tasty, and 
that would not violate the taboos 
of any people anywhere in the 
world. In the margenes we may 
have discovered that food.’ 

“ ‘We don’t know where the 
margenes came from,’ the director 
went on to say, ‘and we don’t even 
know yet what they are, biolog- 
ically speaking. What we do know 
is that they provide more energy 
per gram than any other edible 
product known to man, that every- 
one who has eaten them is enthu- 
siastic about their taste, that they 
can be processed and distributed 
easily and cheaply, and that they 
are acceptable even to those who 
have religious or other objections 
to certain other foods, such as beef, 
among the Hindus or pork among 
the Jews and Mohammedans. 

“ ‘Even vegetarians can eat 
them,’ Dr. Willard remarked, 
‘since they are decidely not animal 
in nature. Neither, I may add, are 
they vegetable. They are a hitherto 
utterly unknown synthesis of chem- 
ical elements in living form. Their 
origin remains undiscovered.’ ” 
Naturally, there was no thought 
of feeding people on raw margenes. 
Only a few isolated places in either 
hemisphere would have found live 
food agreeable. Experiment showed 
that the most satisfactory way 
to prepare them was to boil them 
alive, like crabs or lobsters. They 
could then be ground and pressed 
into cakes, cut into convenient 
portions. One one-inch-square cube 
made a nourishing and delicious

meal for a sedentary adult, two for 
a man engaged in hard physical 
labor. 

And they kept coming in from 
the Pacific Ocean nightly, by the 
million. 

By this time none of them had 
to be swept off streets or highways. 
The beach where for nearly a cen- 
tury throngs had gathered for the 
sport of catching grunion was off 
bounds now; it was the property of 
California Margene, Inc., a private 
corporation heavily subsidized by 
the Federal Government as an in- 
fant industry. The grunions them- 
selves had to find another place 
to lay their eggs, or die off — nobody 
cared which. The sand they had 
used for countless millennia as an 
incubator was hemmed in by fac- 
tory buildings and trampled by 
margene - gatherers. The whole 
beautiful shore for miles around 
was devastated; the university had 
to move its marine biological labor- 
atory elsewhere; La Jolla, once a 
delightful suburb and tourist at- 
traction, had become a dirty, noisy 
honkytonk town where processing 
and cannery workers lived and 
spent their off-hours; the unique 
Torrey Pines had been chopped 
down because they interfered with 
the erection of a freight airport. 

But half the world’s people were 
living on margenes. 

The sole possession of this won- 
derful foodstuff gave more power 
to the United States than had pri- 
ority in the atomic bomb. Only be- 
hind the Iron Curtain did the pro- 
duct of California Margene, Inc. 
fail to penetrate. Pravda ran par- 
allel articles on the same day, one 


claiming that margenes- — brzdich - 
noya — had first appeared long ago 
on a beach of the Caspian Sea and 
had for years formed most of the 
Russian diet ; the other warning the 
deluded nations receiving free sup- 
plies as part of American foreign 
aid that the margenes had been in- 
jected with drugs aimed at making 
them weak and submissive to the 
exploitation of the capitalist-imper- 
ialists. 

There was a dangerous moment 
at the beginning when the sudden 
sharp decline in stocks of all other 
food products threatened another 
1929. But with federal aid a fi- 
nancial crash was averted and now 
a new high level of prosperity had 
been established. Technological 
unemployment was brief, and most 
of the displaced workers were soon 
retained for jobs in one of the many 
ramifications of the new margene 
industry. 

Agriculture, of course, under- 
went a short deep depression, not 
only in America but all over the 
world; but it came to an end as 
food other than margenes quickly 
became a luxury product. Farmers 
were able to cut their production 
to a small fraction of the former 
yield, and to get rich on the dizzy- 
ing prices offered for bread, 
apples, or potatoes. And this in- 
creased the prosperity of the baking 
and other related industries as well. 

In fact, ordinary food costs 
(which meant margene costs) 
were so low that a number of the 
larger unions voluntarily asked for 
wage decreases in their next con- 
tracts. California Margene, Inc. 
was able to process, pack, and dis-

tribute margene cakes at an in* 
finitesimal retail price, by reason 
of the magnitude of the output. 

An era of political good feeling, 
fell upon the western world, re- 
flected from the well-fed comfort of 
vast populations whose members 
never before in their lives had had 
quite enough to eat. The fear of 
famine seemed to be over forever, 
and with it the fear of the diseases 
and the social unrest that follow 
famine. Even the U.S.S.R. and its 
satellites, in a conciliatory move 
in the United Nations Assembly, 
suggested that the long cold war 
ought to be amenable to a reason- 
able solution through a series of 
amicable discussions. The western 
nations, assenting, guessed shrewd- 
ly that the Iron Curtain countries 
“wanted in” on the margenes. 

Marge Hickin and Gene To- 
wanda, who had started it all, left 
college for copywriting jobs with 
the agency handling the enormous 
margene publicity; they were mar- 
ried a few months later. 

And the margenes continued to 
come in from the sea in countless 
millions. They were being har- 
vested now from the Pacific itself, 
near the shoreline, before they 
reached the beach. Still no research 
could discover their original source. 

Only a few scientists worried 
about wha\ would happen if the 
margenes should disappear as sud- 
denly as they had arrived. Attempts 
at breeding the creatures had failed 
completely. They did not undergo 
fission, they did not sporulate, they 
seemed to have no sex. No methods 
of reproduction known in the plant 
or animal kingdom seemed to apply 


to them. Hundreds of them were 
kept alive for long periods — they 
lived with equal ease in either air 
or water, and they did not take 
nourishment, unless they absorbed 
it from their environment — but no 
sign of fertility ever appeared. 
Neither did they seem to die of 
natural causes. They just kept com- 
ing in . 

On the night of May 7, 1969, not 
a single margene was visible in the 
ocean or on the beach. 

They never came again. 

What happened as a result is 
known to every student of history. 
The world-wide economic collapse, 
followed by the fall of the most 
stable governments, the huge riots 
that arose from the frantic attempts 
to get possession of the existing 
stocks of margene cakes or of the 
rare luxury items of other edibles, 
the announcement by the U.S.S.R. 
that it had known from the begin- 
ning the whole thing was a gigan- 
tic American hoax in the interests 
of the imperialistic bloodsuckers, 
the simultaneous atomic attacks by 
east and west, the Short War of 
1970 that ruined most of what 
bombs had spared of the Earth, the 
slow struggle back of the remnant 
of civilization which is all of ex- 
istence you and I have ever known 
— all these were a direct outgrowth 
of that first appearance of the 
margenes on the beach near San 
Diego on an April night in 1960. 

Marge and Gene Towanda were 
divorced soon after they had both 
lost their jobs. She was killed in 
the hydrogen blast that wiped out 
San Diego; he fell in the War of 
1970. “Margene” became a dirty

word in every language on Earth. 
What small amount of money and 
ability can be spared is, as every- 
one knows, devoted today to a des- 
perate international effort to reach 
and colonize another habitable 
planet of the Solar System, if such 
there be. 

As for the margenes, themselves, 
out of the untold millions that had 
come, only a few thousand were 
lucky enough to survive and find 
their way back to their over- 
crowded starting-point. In their 
strange way of communication — 
as incomprehensible to us as would 
be their means of nourishment and 
reproduction, or their constitution 
itself — they made known to their 
kin what had happened to them. 
There is no possibility, in spite of 


the terrific over-population of their 
original home and of the others to 
which they are constantly migrat- 
ing, that they will ever come here 
again. 

There has been much specula- 
tion, particularly among writers of 
science fiction, on what would hap- 
pen if aliens from other planets 
should invade Earth. Would they 
arrive as benefactors or as conquer- 
ors? Would we welcome them or 
would we overcome and capture 
them and put them in zoos and 
museums? Would we meet them in 
friendship or with hostility? 

The margenes gave us the an- 
swer. 

Beings from outer space came to 
Earth in 1960. 

And we ate them. • • • 


The Star-Studded April IF 

OBJECT WORSHIP reaches an all-time high! ... In the April issue, 
Robert F. Young spins a biting and pungent satire about what happens 
when a civilization makes the symbolic bluebird of happiness a reality 
and rebuilds its automobile showrooms to resemble cathedrals. With a 
carburetor for a heart, newly sprouted chrome wings and wheels for feet, 
this Bluebird perches on a pedestal in the Church of the Happy Traveler. 
And with the help of such people as the Finance Bishop and such insti- 
tutional rites as New Car Sunday, it supplants the green pastures and still 
waters with The Highways of Heaven. Don’t miss CHROME PAS- 
TURES. It will be one of the most talked about stories of the year . 
Also in this issue: two more novelettes, including HUMAN ERROR, by 
that old master Raymond F. Jones, and an excitement-filled space adven-

T HEY CAME in low, decelerat- 
ing against dense air, while the 
passengers talked, and laughed, 
and pressed their faces against the 
observation ports. 

In the ship’s lounge, a squawk 
box crackled . “Twenty min- 
utes,” a mechanical voice said . 
“We land on Centauri IV in twen- 
ty minutes . Passengers for Orion, 
Antares, Cygni, and Polaris, have 
your transfers ready.” 

Everyone laughed. The speaker

clicked and went dead. And the 
boy who’d been gripping Claude 
Marshall’s arm looked up. 

“What’s he mean, Pop? We 
don’t really have to transfer, do 
we?” 

Claude Marshall smiled. “No, 
Billy. This is as far as we’re going — 
as far as anyone’s going.” 

“But he said — ” 

“He was only joking, Billy. May- 
be someday people will be going to 
those places, but not now.” He 
glanced at his wife, sitting with her 
hands folded in her lap . “I’m 
glad it’s over, Joan,” he said. “It’s 
been a long trip — a very long trip.” 

The woman nodded. She had 
dark hair, and blue eyes, and mi- 



nute lines of maturity around her 
eyes and mouth that seemed to 
soften, rather than age her. She 
looked almost too young to have 
mothered a nine-year-old boy — but 
of course that was one of the re- 
quirements. 

“Is this where we’re going to 
live?” the boy asked. 

Claude looked out the port. “Yes, 
Billy. This is where we’re going to 
live.” 

“Why?” 

“I’ve already told you why. Don’t 
you remember when I showed you 
the pictures, and asked you how 
you’d like to live where you’d have 
lots of room to play, and wouldn’t 
have to worry about the bombs or 
anything?” 

“Sure, Pop,” the boy said. “I re- 
member. But tell me about it again? 

Claude looked at his wife; 
watched her nod, and answer his 
smile. “All right,” he said. He 
raised his arm over the foam- 
cushion seat-back till it rested on 
the boy’s shoulder. 

“You see, Billy, things back on 
Earth are pretty bad — have been 
for over ^ hundred years now. 
There’s too many cities, too many 
wars, and too many people — it’s 
mostly too many people. They don’t 
have room to move around any 
more the way they used to . 

“To make it worse there are al- 
ways some people who figure that 
someone else has a little more room 
than they have, so they try to take 
it away from them by starting a 
war. Not that war ever solves any- 
thing. It’s just that some people 
think it will.” 

“That’s why we left, huh, Pop?” 


“Yes, Billy. That’s why we left. 
The problem was to find some place 
new; some place where a man had 
room to move — room to breathe. 
For a long while it didn’t look as if 
there was such a place — not in our 
solar system anyhow. But one day a 
few years before you were born, a 
fellow by the name of Vincent 
Taibi made a trip out here to Cen- 
tauri ... It was a long trip. Took 
him thirteen years to get out here 
and back. But the important thing 
is that he came back with some 
news . He came back and re- 
ported that there was an unin- 
habited planet out here, just about 
the size of the Earth, that was as 
fresh and new as it was the day 
God made it.” 

“That’s when we got on this ship. 
Right, Pop?” 

Claude frowned. “Well, not' ex- 
actly. You see, Son, to begin with 
this is a long trip — so long, and so 
expensive, that no one except may- 
be a few millionaires would be able 
to afford it. Anyhow, the govern- 
ment wanted young people out 
here : people who could colonize 
the place . They ran a lot of tests, 
Son.” 

“Tests?” 

Claude nodded and turned to 
his wife. “The tests,” he said. “You 
remember the tests, Joan?” 

“Yes, Claude. I remember. It’s 
been six years, but I remember 
them as if they happened yester- 
day.” 

“I don’t, Pop.” 

“That’s ’cause you were too 
young, Son. You didn’t have to 
take the tests ... You were lucky.” 

“Claude! Billy’s not interested in 


100 


JACK LEWIS 



that. Besides they were necessary.” 

“Necessary! All those psychia- 
trists? Oh come, Joan ... I felt as 
if they were picking my brain with 
an ice pick!” 

“But they had to be careful, 
Claude.” 

“Careful, yes . But eight 
months of tests — every day!” 

“Claude!” The woman’s tone 
was severe. 

“Why did they have to be care- 
ful, Pop?” Billy asked. 

“They wanted to be sure, Son. 
They didn’t want anyone out here 
who was sick, or lazy, or who 
wanted to start a war. They figured 
if the right kind of people came out 
here, Centifor would stay as fresh 
and clean as it was the day that 
Captain Taibi first landed here.” 

The boy looked out the porthole. 
“We’ll sure have lots of room here, 
won’t we, Pop?” 

“Yes, Son. We’ll have lots of 
room. The government’s given us 
title to a hundred acres of what’s 
just about the best land in the 
Universe ... I showed you the pic- 
tures of our land, didn’t I?” 

“Sure, Pop. Lots of times.” 

The woman laughed. “About a 
thousand times, I’d imagine . 
Those pictures have been looked at 
so much, they’re frayed at the cor- 
ners.” 

They landed on a concrete 
apron, nestled between ridges of 
rolling hills. The jets belched, 
hissed, went out, and from a ranch 
type structure at the edge of the 
area, a jeep, towing a portable 
ramp moved out to meet them. 

There was a gentle bump. 


Hatches hissed open. And then the 
passengers began to move down the 
ramp. 

Among the last to emerge into 
the bright, warm sunshine, were 
Claude and Joan Marshall. Each 
clasping a hand of their son, they 
stood at the top of the ramp, 
breathing deep gulps of sweet- 
smelling air, and staring at the 
boundless horizon of the fresh, new 
world. 

Clean and unspoiled it was, like 
an immense green carpet, dotted 
with clear, blue lakes, and billions 
of wildflowers that soaked nourish- 
ment out of topsoil twenty inches 
deep. 

A paradise planet, free of bus- 
tling crowds and concrete cities. 
Untainted by littered alleyways, 
and dirty kiosks, and the abomi- 
nable smells of cosmopolitan chaos 
... In place of these was a sun- 
soaked, fairy-like landscape capped 
by fleecy white clouds that hung 
motionless in a sky of robin’s-egg 
blue. 

Claude stabbed an index finger 
at the patchwork quilt of green and 
yellow. 

“Look Joan . Our land! You 
can see it from here!” 

“Where, Claude?” 

“Out there . See? Way out. 
Beyond those lakes!” 

“Oh, Claude. How can you be 
sure?” 

“I remember it from the maps — 
and the pictures . Our land is 
just twenty-eight miles from this 
landing strip, and you cross three 
ridges of hills to get to it . See? 
One . two . three!” 

“Is that where we’re going to 


JEKYLL-HYDE PLANET 


101 



live. Pop?” 

“Yes, Son. That’s where we’re 
going to live. And there isn’t a bet- 
ter piece of land anywhere ... I 
know!” 

At the gentle urging of the at- 
tendant, they moved off the ramp 
and melted into the group of pas- 
sengers drifting toward the ranch- 
type building at the edge of the 
area. A sign over the building said : 
RECEPTION CENTER, and a 
man was standing in front of it. 
The man wasn’t old by Earth 
standards, but leathery skin, and 
steel-grey patches of hair around 
his temples made him look very 
ancient alongside the composite 
youth of the newly-arrived settlers. 

The older man waited till the 
group had formed a tight semi- 
circle around him. Then he smiled 
and held up both hands. 

“Welcome to Centifor,” he said. 
“My name is Leon Stubbs, and I 
am the Director of Colonization.” 

He waited till the undercurrent 
of /muttering had died down, and 
went on : “I know how anxious you 
all are to settle on your own land, 
but because immediate transporta- 
tion is unavailable, there will be a 
slight delay. During this time you 
will be quartered here at the re- 
ception center.” 

Claude Marshall leaned close to 
his wife’s ear. “We’re lucky, Joan,” 
he whispered. “We don’t have to 
worry about transportation. We can 
walk to our land if we have to.” 

Leon Stubbs said : “If any of you 
have any questions, feel free to 
speak up . That’s why I’m here.” 
He stopped, and pointed at a thin- 
faced youth with one arm raised 


while a young, and obviously preg- 
nant girl held onto the other. 

“Yes, Sir.” 

“We’ve been wondering,” the 
youth said. “Are our building ma- 
terials ready yet?” 

“Some of them are,” the director 
said, “and some of them aren’t. 
Production here isn’t quite what it 
should be yet. When you’ve been 
here a while, you’ll realize that be- 
cause of our relatively small num- 
bers, and comparative inexperience 
in economic matters, we’re a tight- 
ly-knit group . We have to be. 

“There is one thing however that 
works in our favor. There are no 
irrationals or psychological deviants 
on Centifor. The tests took care of 
that. They were rough, I know. 
They were supposed to be rough. 
And now that you’re here you’ll all 
be facing another test . The test 
of practical application. 

“Some of you are fortunate in 
the respect that you’ve been 
awarded land reasonably close to 
the spaceport area. Some of you are 
not so fortunate, and will have to 
travel several hundred miles. Per- 
haps those of you in this latter 
category will find some consolation 
in the fact that since you left Terra, 
the government has started a move- 
ment to populate the other side of 
the planet. As a matter of fact, all 
future applications will be assigned 
to that area.” 

Claude looked at his wife. And 
she looked back at him. They didn’t 
speak. They didn’t have to. It was 
common knowledge that Centifor 
was a planet of contrast. It was a 
Jekyll and Hyde planet . One 
side was a veritable Utopia. And 


102 


JACK LEWIS 



the other? Claude shuddered at the 
thought of hacking a living out of 
the razor-backed mountains and 
bare patches of rocky soil that were 
frozen stiff nine months out of 
every thirteen. 

“If there are no other questions,” 
the Director said. “We’ll get on 
with the business of setting you up 
in temporary quarters.” 

Twelve hours later, Claude Mar- 
shall and his family stood on the 
ramp of the spaceport watching the 
blue-tinted sun edge itself over the 
rim of the planet. 

The decision to pack a few im- 
mediate necessities and walk to the 
homestead instead of waiting for 
transportation had been arrived at 
the night before. It was ridiculous, 
Claude had argued, to waste time 
at the reception center, when the 
culmination of a ten year dream lay 
just twenty-eight miles away. Es- 
pecially so, since the Director had 
informed them that the materials 
for their prefab home was already 
waiting for them on the land. 

Nor were they alone in their 
eagerness to begin a new way of 
life. Other settlers — some of them 
burdened-down with supplies that 
almost equalled their own weight — 
had already started a trek over the 
virgin landscape. In twos and 
threes, they plodded into the gen- 
tly-sloping valley. Some of them 
moved slowly, some eagerly. All of 
them looked like tiny ants on a 
giant pool table. 

Marshall adjusted the knapsack 
across his shoulders with an air of 
finality. “Let’s go, Joan,” he said. 
“Stay close, Billy. We have a long 


walk ahead of us.” 

They started into the valley. 

Two hours later they stopped to 
rest. They stopped on a patch of 
rich, green turf in the shadow of a 
broad-leaf tree. The spaceport, 
flanked by its low-slung buildings, 
was still visible, but from seven 
miles away the buildings looked in* 
credibly tiny. Like miniatures out 
of a Christmas kit. But the thing 
that impressed them most was the 
quiet — a strange sort of quiet, free 
of the whir of copter blades, land- 
car horns, and other nerve-shatter- 
ing noises. Instead, there was only 
the rustle of a mild breeze through 
the tree branches, and the sound of 
their own breathing. 

Marshall lay on his back, his 
fingers laced behind his neck. 

“I feel rested, Joan,” he said 
“We’ve just walked seven miles, but 
I feel rested.” 

“I know, Claude. I feel the same 
way. It must be the air. The air 
feels different.” 

“Wouldn’t it be nice if it’d al- 
ways stay this way. Fresh and un- 
spoiled, I mean. I know it won’t, 
but wouldn’t it be nice if it did.” 

“It will, Claude. It will for as 
long as we live anyhow, and for as 
long as Billy lives. That’s what’s 
important. We’re very lucky, 
Claude.” 

“I can’t help thinking of the peo- 
ple back on Earth. I feel sorry for 
them.” 

“They could do what we did. 
They could take the tests.” 

“I know. But even if they did, 
what would they have? Who’d 
want to homestead the other side 
of this planet? Who’d want to live 


JEKYLL-HYDE PLANET 


103 



out there anyway?” 

“I would, Pop,” Billy said. 

“No you wouldn’t. Son. Don’t 
you remember those black moun- 
tains we saw from the ship when 
we came in?” 

“Sure, Pop.” 

“Well that’s what the other side 
of the planet is like. Only you 
couldn’t tell what it was really like 
because we were too high. You 
wouldn’t like it if you had to live 
there. It’s cold, and rocky, and 
there’s only six hours of daylight 
out of every twenty-six.” 

“I wouldn’t like it then,” the boy 
said. “I don’t like the dark.” 

Claude got up and looked at his 
wife. “Shall we move along,” he 
said. 

They pushed ahead. Eagerly, yet 
slowly enough to absorb the world’s 
endless beauty; stopping at the 
crest of each new hill; kneeling at 
the shores of crystal lakes to quench 
their thirst; and scooping up hand- 
fuls of rich, black soil in spots 
where the turf had become dis- 
lodged. 

The sun of Centauri was almost 
at zenith when they approached 
the crest of the ridge that bounded 
the Marshall homestead. 

Claude’s pace, which had been 
quickening steadily for the final 
mile, burst into a jagged trot for 
the final hundred uphill yards. At 
the top of the hill he stopped, star- 
ing into the lush, green valley, ig- 
noring his family who’d been un- 
able to keep pace with his eager- 
ness. 

The homestead was all that the 
color photos had advertised — and 
more. It was all there. The flat, 

104 


rich turf, the stream running 
through the center of the valley, 
and the grove of trees under which 
he’d build the prefab house. 

He’d anticipated the moment so 
many times, it was hard to believe 
it had really arrived. But it was real 
— it was. Everything was exactly as 
he’d expected to find it . except 
for one thing. 

Always in his imagination, the 
land had been waiting for him to 
claim it. Him alone — and his wife 
and son. 

But they weren’t alone . There 
were other people on the land. On 
his land! 

And they were acting as if they 
lived there! 


HERE WERE three of them — 
a man, a woman, and a boy of 
about nineteen. The woman ap- 
peared to be cooking a meal over a 
wood fire, while the man and boy 
were arranging a foundation pat- 
tern with part of the stack of build- 
ing materials which had been ear- 
marked for the house. 

For his house! 

Joan and Billy drew up alongside 
him, and together they stared at 
the intruders. 

“Who are they, Claude?” his 
wife said. “What does it mean?” 

“I don’t know, honey. Maybe 
they just stopped here to eat. That’s 
what it must be.” 

“But the men. The way they’re 
measuring ... As if they’re going 
to build.” 

“We’ll straighten it out, Joan . 
Probably some mistake. I have our 
land title. That’ll prove they’ve 

JACK LEWIS 




made a mistake. Come on. We’ll 
talk to them.” 

The intruders stopped what they 
were doing as they approached, 
and the man — a huge, block-shoul- 
dered fellow in a leather jacket — 
pushed out a hand. 

The man said : “Hello. My 

name’s Whiting — Bruce Whiting.” 

Claude took the hand. “Claude 
Marshall,” he said. “And this is my 
wife and my son.” 

The man who called himself 
Whiting nodded, and looked over 
at his wife. “We’re fixing dinner,” 
he said. “Why don’t you and your 
family join us before you push on?” 

Claude watched the man’s face 
while he spoke. It was an open face. 
Guileless. With ruddy skin and 
mild, grey eyes that twinkled a bit 
at the corners. 

“We’re not pushing on,” he said 
evenly. We’re staying. This is our 
land.” 

Bruce Whiting smiled. “There 
must be some mistake. This land is 
ours. The boy and I are just fixing 
to start building.” 

Claude shook his head. “Not 
here you’re not. Not on this land.” 
He spoke quietly ; trying to keep his 
voice pitched below the emotion 
that churned up inside him. 

“What’s wrong, Dad?” The 
man’s son joined them . He was 
a big strapping lad, with sandy 
hair and very bright skin. 

“These people are looking for 
their homestead,” the man with the 
jacket said. “They think this is their 
site.” 

“You think wrong, Mister,” the 
youth said. “We double checked 
this location three times before we 


made camp . Right?” He turned 
to the older man for confirmation. 

Whiting nodded. “The boy’s 
right. This land is ours. We’ve got 
a deed to prove it.” 

“So have I,” Claude said frown- 
ing. “It’s right here in the luggage 
. Wait. I’ll show you . .” He 
bent over, unzipping the knapsack 
and rummaged around till he pro- 
duced the manila envelope that 
held the title papers. 

Bruce Whiting examined them 
carefully; first the neat rows of fine 
print, then the dozen glossy color- 
photos which had been taken on 
the property from strategic angles. 
He shook his head and turned to 
his son. 

“Get our titles, Frank,” he said. 

The boy left, returning within 
seconds with a similar manila en- 
velope. Bruce Whiting opened it 
and pushed a handful of papers at 
Claude. 

While his wife and son watched, 
Claude Marshall went through the 
papers methodically . They were 
all there. All the measurements; 
looking like duplicates, backed up 
by photos that had apparently been 
developed from the same negatives 
. He glanced at his wife. 

“Something’s wrong, Joan,” he 
said. “Mr. Whiting has a claim on 
this land too. It’s just like ours . 
Exactly!” 

“But I don’t understand, 
Claude.” 

“It’s not too hard to understand, 
Mrs. Marshall,” Whiting said. “It 
just means that someone in Wash- 
ington loused up the detail. They’re 
always making mistakes like that 
... I figure some clerk — ” 


JEKYLL-HYDE PLANET 


105 



“But what are we supposed to 
do?” 

Bruce Whiting moved his shoul- 
ders. “I don’t know, Mrs. Marshall. 
I just don’t know ... After all we 
were here first . Why don’t you take 
it up with the Colonization Direc- 
tor? . Maybe there’s another 
tract he could give you.” 

“I don’t want another tract,” 
Claude said flatly. “I want this 
one.” 

“So do I, Mr. Marshall.” 

“But the land’s mine!” 

“Is it? How about my title? It’s 
just as valid as yours.” 

“That’ll be for the law to de- 
cide,” Claude said grimly, “And 
we’ll fight you on it. By God, we’ll 
fight you on it all the way from 
here to Washington and back!” 
“That’s up to you, of course. In 
the meantime, may I remind you 
that I hold possession?” 

Claude Marshall bit his lip. 
“Let’s go Joan,” he said. 
“Where, Claude?” 

“Back to the spaceport. We’ll 
get a ruling on this.” 

“But it’s getting dark. Can’t we 
make camp someplace and go back 
tomorrow?” 

“I’m hungry,” Billy said. 

“We can eat later, Son.” 

Bruce Whiting continued to re- 
gard them sullenly. Then abruptly, 
his face softened. “Wait,” he said. 
“Don’t go. Your wife’s right, Mr. 
Marshall. You can’t make the trip 
after dark. Why don’t you and 
your family camp here for the night 
. Alice has supper nearly ready 
and there’s more than enough to go 
around . .” 

“We have our own rations,” 
106 


Claude said. 

Bruce Whiting spread out his 
hands. “Look, Mr. Marshall. I 
know how you feel. I know, be- 
cause it’s the same way 1 feel. I 
guess a man can’t help the way he 
feels when something threatens the 
thing he’s been dreaming about all 
his life. But it isn’t my fault that 
this happened any more than it’s 
your fault. Since the problem con- 
cerns both of us, I suggest we sit 
down and discuss it like intelligent 
human beings.” 

“Mr. Whiting’s right,” Joan said. 
“After all it isn’t his fault — ” 

“Another thing,” Bruce Whiting 
went on. “I’m expecting a half- 
trac out here tomorrow with some 
supplies. If you and your family 
wanted to, there’s no reason why 
we couldn’t all ride back with him 
. Maybe we could get this thing 
straightened out then and still be 
friends.” 

Claude flicked a look toward the 
far-off hills that were haloed by 
the last rays of a strange sun. With- 
in moments it would be dark. And 
a few yards away a woman threw 
* another log on the fire and the pun- 
gent aroma of boiling coffee drifted 
across his nostrils. 

“I’m hungry,” Billy repeated. 

Claude held out his hand. 

“I’m sorry,” he said. “As you 
say: this isn’t our fault. We’re just 
caught in the middle.” 

The ate picnic-style, off plastic 
dishes, while Bruce Whiting kept 
up a continuous stream of conver- 
sation, aided from time to time by 
his comely wife. 

The Whiting’s story was a famil- 

JACK LEWIS 



iar one. He’d been with an adver- 
tising agency when the coloni- 
zation urge had struck him . That 
was ten years ago . He’d talked it 
over with his wife, and together 
they’d weighed the chances of sur- 
viving the rigid tests that elimi- 
nated 97% of the applicants. 

The story had a pattern you 
could play by ear. Just another 
man, and another woman, and an- 
other boy now in his teens, who’d 
grown tired of the struggle for sur- 
vival in a world that begrudged a 
man the space occupied by his own 
body. 

And when the meal was over, 
Joan helped Alice Whiting with 
the dishes, while the men sat 
around the fire and smoked. It was 
dark out now — a strange kind of 
darkness, split only by billions of 
incredibly bright stars and the near- 
by glow of the crackling wood fire. 

Bruce Whiting’s cordiality was 
contagious too. Claude found him- 
self talking now ; describing his 
wants, his ideas, and his ideals. And 
when the women returned to the 
circle, the conversation turned to 
other subjects. They discussed 
clothes, their children, and the 
future of the planet. 

Only one subject was carefully 
avoided. 

And that was the one that was 
foremost in the minds of all of 
them. 

They were still talking when the 
fire had settled into weary heaps of 
smouldering embers. Then the 
two families excused themselves 
and retired to the canvas lean-to’s 
wondering what the next day 
would hold in store for them. 


T HE BLUE sun of Centauri 
was almost at zenith the next 
day, when the half-trac arrived 
with the supplies. 

The driver — an amiable man — 
listened patiently while Bruce and 
Claude related the mixup, and as 
had been expected, agreed to trans- 
port them back to the base. 

The two families rode together 
in the open back of the vehicle as 
it jounced over the mildly slop- 
ing terrain. And yet the ride was 
not unpleasant. The immensity of 
the planet was breathtaking. It was 
exactly as the colorcasts had pic- 
tured it — only better, incredibly 
better. No TV travelogue could 
adequately describe the tang of the 
air, or the scent of the sweet-smell- 
ing grass. 

God had indeed been generous 
with this portion of the planet. 

It was hard to believe that the 
opposite side was a rocky waste- 
land that would probably fight 
colonization for another thousand 
years. 

Almost before they knew it, they 
were at the spaceport. Sometime 
during the night, another ship had 
arrived. It stood majestically at the 
far end of the apron, towering over 
a knot of tiny figures grouped 
around the rudder stanchions. 

The driver swooped past them 
and brought the half-trac to a halt 
in front of the reception center 
where they observed the Coloni- 
zation Director watching them 
through the window of his office. 

Inside, Leon Stubbs greeted them 
cordially and ushered them into an 
inner office containing a metal desk 
and a dozen file cabinets.

The Director listened patiently, 
shaking his head from time to time 
and muttering remarks about gov- 
ernment inefficiency . When 
they’d finished, he ran his hand 
through his greying hair. 

“This, of course, is an outrage, 
Gentlemen,” he said. “But before 
I can do anything, I’ll have to 
check both your claims.” He indi- 
cated the file cabinets. “It may 
take a little time but I’ll get at it 
right away. As a matter of fact I 
believe they’re serving lunch at the 
mess hall now. Why don’t you all 
have lunch and come back in about 
an hour. I’ll know more about the 
situation then.” 

Leon Stubbs shuffled through 
some papers on the desk, indicating 
dismissal. The two men joined 
their families in the anteroom. 

After an awkward silence, Bruce 
Whiting and his family excused 
themselves, leaving the Marshall’s 
alone. 

“What did he say, Claude? Tell 
me! What did he say?” 

“He doesn’t know yet, honey. 
He’s checking the claims. We’re 
supposed to come back in an hour.” 

“But it will be all right, won’t it. 
It’s got to be all right!” 

“I don’t know, Joan. So help 
me, I don’t know ... We can’t 
both have the land. That’s for sure. 
One of us will have to settle for 
someplace else.” 

“Suppose we did have to take an- 
other tract, Claude. Would you be 
disappointed — I mean, really dis- 
appointed . After all, isn’t the 
important thing the fact that we’re 
here?” 

Claude managed a smile. “I 
108 


suppose so,” he admitted. “It’s just 
that it comes as sort of a letdown. 
For almost seven years now we’ve 
been looking at the pictures of this 
land. We knew where we’d build 
the house, what portion we’d farm 
... I know every tree, every square 
inch of it . And now — ” 

“But there’s other land. We’ve 
only seen a small portion of the 
planet.” 

He shook his head. 

“Not like this. This claim has 
everything. What’s more, Whiting 
knows it. That’s why he’ll fight us 
on it all the way.” 

“They seem like nice people. 
Claude. Couldn’t we talk to them 
. make some sort of deal?” 

“A deal? What sort of deal?” 

“A hundred acres is a lot of land 
— an awful lot of land . Maybe 
the Whitings would — ” 

“Uh uh. No good. I’ve already 
felt him out on that. I had the 
same idea last night, so I came 
right out and asked him if he’d 
settle for fifty acres apiece . 
He refused. Oh, he was nice enough 
about it. But he gave me to under- 
stand it was all or nothing with 
him.” 

“I’m hungry,” Billy said. 

Claude looked at his wife. “So 
am I. Let’s go over to the mess hall. 
That’s where the Whitings went, I 
think.” 

“Claude?” 

“Yes, Joan.” 

“Let’s not sit with them, if we 
meet them there.” 

“All right, honey. Let’s not.” 
They were halfway to the door 
when Leon Stubbs came out of the 
inner office. He smiled. 

JACK LEV/18 



“Mind stepping inside a mo- 
ment ?” he said. 

When Claude hesitated, he 
added : “Perhaps Mrs. Marshall 
had better come in too.” 

They followed him inside where 
the Director indicated two chairs 
alongside the desk. 

“I’ve been checking your 
claims,” he said. “And since you 
were still here, I didn’t think it ad- 
visable to prolong the suspense.” 

Claude glanced at his wife. 

“You mean it’s all right . the 
land is ours?” 

The Director sat down and 
spread open a pair of folders on 
the desk. For a long while he stared 
at them — comparing them. He 
shook his head. 

“I’m afraid not, Mr. Marshall. 
I’m afraid it isn’t all right.” 

“But our claim. It’s valid, isn’t 
it?” 

Leon Stubbs ran a hand through 
his greying hair. “I don’t know,” 
he said. “Naturally the fault for 
processing duplicate claims lies 
with the colonization bureau in 
Washington. Eventually, I sup- 
pose it will be up to them to de- 
cide on the disposition of this case 
. However, because of the time- 
lag in communications, I have full 
authority to pass down temporary 
decisions in matters of this type 
. And because Mr. Whiting’s 
claim is dated several days ahead of 
yours, I must in all fairness award 
the land to him . You and your 
wife can appeal that decision of 
course.” 

“We’ll appeal, Mr. Stubbs,” 
Claude said angrily. “After all, this 
mess is the government’s fault. Not 


ours! It’s up to them to straighten 
it out.” 

“That’s up to you,” Leon Stubbs 
said. “Although I’m sure you real- 
ize that in the meantime you’ll have 
to make some temporary arrang- 
ments.” 

“Temporary arrangments?” 

“Yes, Mr. Marshall. Even assum- 
ing the government decides in your 
favor — which I doubt — you’ll have 
to live somewhere while the case is 
being processed . And that will 
take some time.” 

“How long?” 

Leon Stubbs shuffled through 
the papers again. 

“You know about the time-lag, 
don’t you?” 

“No. What about the time-lag?” 

The Director met his stare. “I 
thought you knew. Actually the 
only communication we have with 
Terra short of space travel, is by 
short wave radio, and radio waves 
as you may know travel at approx- 
imately the speed of light. Since 
we are approximately 4.4 light- 
years away from Earth, a round 
trip message to Washington would 
take about nine years. This of 
course does not take into consider- 
ation the time needed to process 
your case.” 

Claude kept watching the Direc- 
tor’s face while he spoke. He looked 
like an honest man. To all intents 
and purposes he was simply a 
public servant performing a dis- 
tasteful duty. Yet there was some- 
thing about his voice that had an 
all-too-familiar ring . Something 
that hinted he was leading up to 
an offer. 

Claude cleared his throat. “All 


JEKYLL-HYDE PLANET 


109 



right, Mr. Stubbs. So you’ve con- 
vinced me of the futility of appeal- 
ing the claim. What now?” 

Leon Stubbs bit off the end of 
a cigar and lit it before answering. 

"I’ve arranged to give you and 
your family an alternate claim, Mr. 
Marshall. Of course it isn’t quite as 
desirable as the original one. But 
under the circumstances — ” He let 
the sentence trail off. 

"I see,” Claude said. "And where 
is this alternate claim?” 

Stubbs examined the end of his 
cigar. 

"It’s on the other side of the 
planet, Mr. Marshall. I’m sorry, 
but that’s the best I can do.” 

At his elbow, Claude caught the 
sharp intake of his wife’s breath. 

"It really isn’t too bad,” the Di- 
rector went on. "Many of the re- 
ports about the cold-side have been 
exaggerated.” 

"I’m sure they have,” Claude 
said bitterly. "I’m sure it’s just the 
place to bring up a nine-year-old 
boy.” 

"Please Mr. Marshall. Don’t be 
bitter. It isn’t my fault.” 

Claude got up placing his palms 
on the edge of the metal desk. He 
leaned forward till his face was only 
inches away from the Director’s 
cigar, and said: "Isn’t it?” 

The Director didn’t answer. In- 
stead he got up and walked over 
to the open window. For ten full 
seconds he stared out at the lush 
valley that flanked the spaceport. 
Then he turned. 

"You want my advice, Mr. 
Marshall?” 

Claude shrugged his shoulders. 

“Go home,” Leon Stubbs said. 

110 


,c You can’t bring up a boy on the 
cold-side. It just wouldn’t work.” 

"But we just got here,” Joan said. 
“We sold everything we had to 
come here!” 

Stubbs nodded. "I know,” he 
said. He indicated the folders. "It’s 
all there in your records. Six years 
ago you left Terra with six- thou- 
sand credits. But surely with that 
kind of money you could get a 
fresh start almost anywhere.” 

"But we want to stay here, Mr. 
Stubbs.” 

Stubbs took a drag out of the. 
cigar. 

"I know,” he said woodenly. 

Claude remained silent, regard- 
ing the conversation carefully. A 
pattern was beginning to form 
now — a familar pattern. He walked 
over to where the Director was 
standing. 

"Perhaps you could make a sug- 
gestion, Mr. Stubbs. Surely there 
must be opportunities on this side 
of the planet for a man with six- 
thousand credits?” 

"I’m not quite sure what you’re 
getting at,” Leon Stubbs said. 

"I think you do, Mr. Stubbs,” 
Claude retorted. "I think we’re 
both getting at the same thing. Sup- 
pose we dispense with the subtleties 
and get down to cases.” 

The Director sat down at the 
desk pyramiding his fingertips. 

"Very well, Mr. Marshall,” he 
said. "I’ll be blunt. It’s occurred 
to me that if the date on your claim 
were changed, the land would nat- 
urally be yours. The difficulty of 
course lies in the fact that there 
are duplicate records on Terra and 
we’d have to take care of the man 

JACK LEWIS 



who handles them. Otherwise the 
discrepancy would show up even- 
tually. Actually, I want nothing 
for myself but these people in 
Washington — ” 

“Yeah, I know,” Claude inter- 
rupted. “It’s someone else who’s 
getting the money. It’s always 
someone else who’s getting the 
money.” 

“It would take quite a bit, I’m 
afraid,” the Director said ignoring 
the sarcasm. 

“How much?” 

The Director stubbed out the 
end of his cigar. “About five thou- 
sand,” he said. “Yes. Five thousand 
ought to do it.” 

Claude looked at his wife. 

And she looked back at him. 

Outside, Billy had tired of the 
seven-year-old magazine and was 
hammering on the door for admit- 
tance. 

“Can we have a few minutes to 
think it over?” Claude said. 

“Certainly,” Stubbs said amiably. 
“And I want to make it quite 
clear, Mr. Marshall, that this 
money is not for me. There’s this 
fellow — ” 

“Yeah, I know. There’s this fel- 
low in Washington. Come on Joan. 
Let’s step outside a moment.” 

T EN MINUTES later, Leon 
Stubbs answered their knock 
and ushered them to the desk 
chairs. After they were seated, he 
said: “I take it you’ve talked it 
over.” 

Claude nodded. “Yes, Mr. 
Stubbs. My wife and I talked it 
over and we came to a decision.” 


“I’m glad,” the Director said. 
“And may I say I think you’re do- 
ing a wise thing. Centifor’s a beau- 
tiful place. Simply beautiful . .” 

“Yes it is,” Claude agreed. “It 
is beautiful. That’s why we’d like 
to see it stay that way.” 

The Director raised an eyebrow. 

“My wife and I talked it over,” 
Claude went on, “and we decided 
that taking someone else’s land 
whether it’s done by theft, force, or 
bribery is wrong. We thought of 
this place as something fresh and 
clean. We thought all those tests 
we took were designed to keep 
people like you out of here. Now it 
appears we were mistaken. We’ve 
talked it over, Mr. Stubbs, and 
we’ve decided to go back to Earth 
and expose you.” 

“But you can’t,” the Director 
said. “You’ve — ” 

“Yes we can,” Claude said. “The 
ships go back practically empty. A 
return berth will be no trouble at 
all. We’re returning on the first 
ship out.” 

“Perhaps we could make a bet- 
ter deal.” Stubbs said. “Perhaps 
five thousand is too much. Per- 
haps — ” 

“No. No deals! Let’s go Joan.” 

They went outside, into the fresh 
warm sunshine, staring at the tor- 
pedo shaped spaceship standing in 
the clearance area half-a-mile 
away. 

They’d just started toward it, 
when a jeep squealed up along- 
side them. Bruce Whiting was at 
the wheel. 

“Hi,” he said. “Hop in. I’ll give 
you a lift.” 

“Thanks,” Claude said without 


111 


JEKYLL-HYDE PLANET 



bitterness. He helped his wife and 
son into the rear seat and climbed 
in beside the driver. 

“I suppose congratulations are 
in order,” he said as the other man 
threw the vehicle into gear. “Stubbs 
tells me the land is yours now.” 

The driver nodded, inching 
down on the accelerator. The 
vehicle leaped forward. At sev- 
enty miles an hour, they swooped 
past the spaceship and the knot 
of people standing in the shadow 
of the rudder stanchions. 

“Hey. Slow up!” Claude yelled. 
“We’re getting off here. We’re 
booking return passage on that 
ship!” 

Whiting didn’t answer. 

The low slung buildings of the 
clearance area leaped up at them 
and passed into the background. 
They were heading into open coun- 
try now. 

“Whiting! Turn around. We’re 
staying here in the clearance area!” 

Whiting’s foot slacked off the 
accelerator. The speedometer 
dropped to fifty. But the vehicle 
kept moving into open country. 
The man at the wheel flicked a 
look at Claude and smiled. 

“Congratulations, Mr. Mar- 


shall,” he said. “You’ve passed the 
final test.” 

“Test? I don’t understand.” 

“Let me explain then,” Bruce 
Whiting said. “In the first place 
my name isn’t Whiting . It’s 
Reed — Paul Reed. I work for the 
government. This final test — the 
one you just went through — was 
designed to weed out any undesir- 
ables who might have slipped 
through our screening processes 
back on Earth. 

“You mean this whole build up 
was just a test?” 

The other man nodded. “We 
give it to every new arrival here. 
Now that you’ve passed, I’m driv- 
ing you out to your homestead 
site.” 

Claude looked back at the newly- 
arrived spaceship and the tiny 
figures who were huddled at its 
base. 

“All those people,” he said. “You 
mean they still have to go through 
what we did?” 

The driver shook his head. 

“No. Those people are going 
back to Earth. You see, Mr. Marsh- 
all, those are the people who 
offered Leon Stubbs the bribe.”

III the near future teeth and bone 
structure may be replaced with 
real bones. A team of scientists has 
succeeded in taking the minerals 
out of animal bones, making them 
soft and spongelike. Then they have 
been able to reharden or recalcify 
them by treating them with certain 
chemicals and placing them in a 
solution similar to body fluids. This 
finding presents the possibility that 
dentists may be able to rake this 
soft “demineralized” bone, treat it 
chemically, and then insert it as a 
natural filling in a drilled tooth 
cavity where it would harden and 
become part of the tooth. In ad- 
dition, teeth may be prevented 
from falling out by building the 
bone up around them. Orthopedic 
surgeons may also be able to use 
this process to speed the healing of 
fractures or to replace bones lost by 
accident or disease. 

A picture of Medicine at the end 

of the century, recently presented 
before the American Medical As- 
sociation, reveals, some remarkable 
improvements. It predicts the erad- 
ication of all human infectious di- 
seases, including tuberculosis, rheu- 
matic heart disease, diphtheria, 


pneumonia and even the common 
cold and other respiratory ills. Can- 
cer will be treated successfully by 
turning viruses against it. Eye sur- 
geons will have restored vision 
where successful treatment today 
can only be called “wishful think- 
ing”. Starvation will no longer ex- 
ist because of the successful syn- 
thesis of foodstuffs. Deaf mutes 
will speak by use of portable elec- 
tronic devices. Vital organs such as 
the heart, kidney, pancreas and 
lungs will be transplanted from 
person to person. Insulin will be 
taken in tablet form. There will 
have been effective treatments* 
against high blood pressure, arteri- 
osclerosis, degenerative heart di- 
sease, leukemia and pernicious 
anemia. Hormone medication will 
keep women young, beautiful and 
shapely indefinitely. 

Need for a signalling system much 
faster than today’s dial system has 
spurred the development of a new 
device so fast that it may well do 
away with the dial. Developed by 
Bell laboratories, the device is 
called a polytonic coder and is 
based on a new mathematical con- 
cept of electronic coding. A test 
model will send 100 digits a sec- 
ond over almost all telephone con- 
nections. To make use of this new 
super speed, the present dialing 
system would have to be replaced 
by a push-button system. With 
such a phone, you would punch out 
the number you want on buttons 
while the receiver is still on the 
hook. When the receiver is lifted 
the called number’s phone will 
start ringing. If the fine is busy 


113 



you needn’t dial again; the button 
setting will remain until you 
change it. 

Smokers may soon be bombarded 
with advertising about “the cig- 
arette with the built-in ashtray”. A 
new glass-fiber paper developed by 
the National Bureau of Standardis 
does the trick. It will not bum, but 
holds the ashes in place until the 
cigarette is smoked down to the 
point where it is thrown away. 
Made from glass fibers 1/50,000 of 
an inch thick, the new paper is also 
one of the best smoke filters. It al- 
lows only one smoke particle in 
100,000 to pass through. Made by 
forcing molten glass through tiny 
holes and then stretching the fibers 
in hot air, the new paper is eight 
times as strong as previous papers 
and has a smooth silky texture. 

With thirty dollars worth of equip- 
ment you will be able to turn your 
car of the future into a rolling 
Geiger counter. The equipment 
consists of a Geiger-Mueller tube 
and a few associated components. 
Radiation is indicated by either 
telltale clicks on the speaker of the 
car radio or by the movement of 
a needle on a dashboard-mounted 
meter. In addition to normal use, 
the speaker could also be used to 
receive instructions from civil de- 
fense authorities in time of atomic 
warfare, while the meter would 
warn of radiation. Designed to de- 
tect radiation within a fifty-foot 
radius, the unit would not only 
serve to warn occupants of danger 
but would make the car available 
for monitoring during emergency. 


Fishermen will soon be taking along 
electric light bulbs for bait. Nor- 
wegian technicians have devised i, 
metal container with four windows 
through which an electric light 
shines. When the apparatus is 
lowered into the water, the light at- 
tracts the fish to swim close to it. 
The lower part of the container, 
lying in darkness, is equipped with 
hooks. When the gear is jerked up- 
wards the dazzled fish are theoret- 
ically hooked. In trawling several 
of the light ray sinkers are placed 
on a special hoop set at the mouth 
of a trawl net The fish attracted to 
the light, gather in front of the net, 
thus considerably increasing the 
catch. The gear has showed some 
extremely promising results in 
tests made by the Fish and Wild- 
life Service in the Pacific Ocean 
and in salmon fisheries. 

Farms of the future may be dotted 
with artificial ponds instead of 
grainfields. Experiments have 
shown that the common pond weed 
is equal or superior to alfalfa meal 
in a pig-fattening diet. The moss- 
like weed which can be found in 
even a goldfish bowl yields from 12 
to 14 tons of green weight per acre 
in a test pond in Kansas. It also re- 
places itself within three months. 
The dehydrated meal resembles al- 
falfa meal but is darker and less 
dusty. Besides feeding cattle from 
the pond weed, the artificial ponds 
also serve as a boon to irrigation 
problems and as an extra source of 
proteins in the form of fish. 

Electrical batteries a decade hence 
will be powered with by-product 


114 



atomic radiation converted directly 
into electricity. Radioisotopes from 
the debris of United States atomic 
power reactors might furnish the 
radiation that could be converted 
into electrical energy equivalent to 
2,000,000 watts from the annual 
production of batteries. The pos- 
sible substitution of atomic bat- 
teries for the conventional chemical 
ones is foreseen by scientists at the 
R.C.A. corporation. The most de- 
sirable radioactive wastes for the 
purpose include strontium 90 and 
yttrium 90, and tritium or triple- 
weight hydrogen. These are cheap 
enough for such use and also have 
a long enough life. 

Other predictions for the atomic 
age made at a recent conference 
concerning waste debris from the 
reactors included: Preservation of 
foodstuffs by cold sterilization; 
sterilization of medical supplies 
such as antibiotics drugs and band- 
ages, to make them safer after 
they are packed for shipment; pre- 
vention of trichinosis by irradiat- 
ing hog carcasses; and making 
bones, heart tissues and other ma- 
terials from “banks’* used in hu- 
man replacement surgery safe for 
use by irradiating them with 
gamma rays from cobalt 60. The 
cold sterilization of food promises 
to usher in as radical a revolution 
in food preservation as the inven- 
tion of canning produced for heat 
sterilization. And the success of 
bone grafts with gamma radiated 
material has already proved the 
value of the technique in surgery. 

A new look in flying suits will soon 


be apparent and both passengers 
and pilots may well be wearing 
them for high altitude flying. 
Called a “T” suit, the garment fits 
rather like an old-fashioned corset 
and needs almost as much assist- 
ance to tighten the many laces 
properly. Once snugly wrapped in, 
a pilot is protected from failure of 
his pressurized cabin, even at alti- 
tudes of up to 65,000 feet, where 
his body would literally burst from 
the low pressure. The suit actually 
holds the wearer together in emer- 
gency decompressions. If the plastic 
cockpit windshield shatters during 
high-altitude flight, the suit and the 
pilot’s helmet would automatically 
fill with compressed oxygen. This 
enables the pilot to dive the plane 
for lower altitude.

more human beings in the world 
like James E. Gunn it would indeed 
be a better one. In the meantime, 
our tame author had been brows- 
ing thru a copy of Ron Smith’s ex- 
cellent fanzine, Inside , which he’d 
purchased at the Con, and he was 
puzzled by some of the slang (or 
slan) terms used by the fans. I ex- 
plained the origin and meaning of 
a number of the strange words to 
him, and in particular the earliest 
abbreviation of them all, “stf”, with 
which I have become so intimately 
identified that many people, not 
possessing a copy of The Fancy- 
clopedia, probably think I origin- 
ated it. I explained to Jim how 
Hugo Gernsback himself first cre- 
ated the portmanteau word, scien- 
tifiction, at least 30 years ago if 
not longer, arid that it had enjoyed 
a vogue for many years, gradually 
giving way to plain science fiction 
(with or without a hyphen) and 
a variety of abbreviations thereof: 
S.F., SF, s.f., sf, sci-fic, and latterly, 
as a parallel to hi-fi, sci-fi. I got in- 
terested, and when I got home I 
consulted my magazine files of the 
early 30’s, to see if I could track 
down the first appearance in print 
of the abbreviation “stf”. 

For the records: my first stf 
correspondent, Linus Hogenmiller, 
sometime c. 1931, created the ab- 
breviation. I was the first to use 
it in print, and later give it the 
pronunciation “stef” instead of “es- 
ti-ef”; but Linus, come out, come 
out, wherever you are, and get your 
egoboo ! (Egoboo: boosting of the 
ego. A term favored by Charles 

116 


Burbee. ) 

Incidental intelligence : in search- 
ing for the first appearance in 
print of the abbreviation “stf’, I 
ran across a letter by myself pub- 
lished when I was 14, wherein 
(Apr. ’31 Astounding ) I was as- 
tounded to find myself using the 
term “Mr. Science Fiction”. Only 
then, a vogue of the day to be 
phonetic, I spelled it “Mr. Syence 
Ficshun”. 

SMALL DEPT of Truth Being 
Stranger Than Science Fiction: a 
serious report has come from the 
Union of South Africa that a sci- 
ence fiction novel written by a 17 
year old girl has been banned there, 
and that a fine of $2800 attaches 
to possession of a copy and any 
owner risks imprisonment for up 
to five years! This is the honest-to- 
God, gospel truth, but I am at a 
loss to offer any explanation for 
it. Have I a South African reader 
who might enlighten us all? I can 
only tell you that the work was 
first published 137 years ago. It 
made a name for Mary Wollstone- 
craft Shelley, and a career for Boris 
Karloff. You can pick up a pocket- 
book edition at most any second- 
hand magazine shop for a dime. 
Take one with you to South Africa 
and its value will increase 28,000 
times! $2800 is only about $45 
rent a month for a furnished cell, 
and presumably the meals are free: 
so if you want to relax with a good 
book and get away from it all, Sud- ' 
Afrika beckons. Just bring your 
own FRANKENSTEIN! — fja 




Dear Editor: 

The letter from G.W. Walton in 
the October issue of IF was suffi- 
ciently irritating to compel me to 
take up the cudgel so generously 
proffered. I have no quarrel with 
his right to believe what he chooses, 
but I do feel justified in disagree- 
ing with him emphatically. His at- 
tempts to establish his views as ab- 
solute logic, and as such irrefutable, 
do not succeed. They achieve only 
a thinly veiled attempt to rational- 
ize his own uncontrolled specula- 
tion. 

Time travel exists only in im- 
agination. I consider it quite pre- 
sumptuous of any one person to set 
up rules and limitations, expecting 
writers and editors to concur. 
Mathematical fantasy . uncon- 
trolled speculation . who cares? 
Any approach to an idea is accept- 
able provided it implements a good 


story. How can a writer be con- 
demned for the free use of imagina- 
tion when no fiction at all is possi- 
ble without it? G.W.’s statement 
about telepathy is not acceptable by 
his own standards either. Following 
all the information available you 
find that no conclusive evidence is 
available at present. If there were 
no possibility other than the one 
claimed by him, further research 
would be pointless. If all progress 
were hampered by such a narrow 
view, humans might never have 
learned to write . 

I have been taught that one of 
the prime requisites of a scientific 
mind is a certain clear logical ap- 
proach to any situation. Will you 
please explain, G.W., what sort of 
thinking leads you to demand that 
only proven fact be permitted in 
the most imaginative fiction avail- 
able? It is your privilege to believe 
what you choose, my only interest 
is in keeping one of my favorite 
editors out of your opinionated 
clutches. I value his efforts to pre- 
sent a magazine that offers the best 
in science fiction, and for my money 
IF is everything it should be. I hope 
he 5 11 buy any time travel or telepa- 
thy themed tales that have the 
necesssary ingredients.

Sir: 

I’d like to make what one might 
term a half argument. I’m inclined 
to agree with Walton about time 
travel. It is an abstract, and useful 
only as subject matter for science- 
fiction stories. I must, however, dis- 
agree with his statements on telepa- 


117 


thy. To call it absurd is an ab- 
surdity in itself. The potentials of 
the mind are great and the thing 
that has prevented proper applica- 
tion of the potential lies in the mat- 
ter of training. It is a fairly well ac- 
cepted fact that the mind has never 
been fully developed in even the 
greatest men. I believe that when 
we have learned to properly train 
ourselves, mental abilities not yet 
dreamed of will be evident. 

A word about your magazine. I 
fully enjoyed the October issue, 
particularly The Almost Men and 
The Proxies . However such stuff as 
Meeting of the Board is not what I 
would call science-fiction.

Dear Sirs: 

Just finished the October ish and 
loved it — per usual. Then I turned 
to the letter column. Ouch! May I 
answer G.W. Walton and his blast 
against telepathy and time travel? 

First off, I question his definition 
of telepathy as a transmission of 
emotions only. Joseph Jastrow, 
A.B., A.M., Ph.D. and LL.D., 
whose section on telepathy is the 
officially accepted standard in the 
National Encyclopedia, defines it as 
“the ability to transfer and receive 
sensations and ideas, mainly in vis- 
ual terms . .” And what is speech 
excepting sounds to transmit visual 
and emotional impressions? 

Secondly, his usage of the word 
“impossible”. Were you aware, 
G.W., that advanced mathema- 
ticians and students of aeronautics 
can “prove” by all the “laws” of 
aeronautics that it’s impossible for 


the sea-gull to fly? The only things 
that are impossible are those which 
we cannot at the time conceive of 
as logically possible. Think back 
one hundred years to the multitude 
of things that were deemed “im- 
possible” but which are standard 
today. We have faith and a think- 
ing mind. For this combination 
nothing is impossible.

Dear Mr. Quinn : 

Sad indeed to find that IF is 
again bi-monthly. I think the cause 
might be charged to its high qual- 
ity; people are not apt to buy a 
magazine that makes them think. 

Some suggestions to Mr. Walton 
are in order. The man seems to put 
his faith in the material universe. 
He is trying to display a scientific 
spirit. But I was of the opinion that 
the scientist, until he could definite- 
ly substantiate any one of several 
opposed, theories, considered all the 
possibilities, probabilities and even 
the impossibilities. How impossible 
a spherical world is to our five 
senses! The fact is that there are 
many opposed theories of time 
travel and telepathy, none of which 
can be completely proven. 

Mr. Walton points out that the 
best telepathy can do is send and 
receive emotions. Frankly I can 
hardly conceive of emotion in its 
pure state, therefore it seems im- 
probable that I could transmit a 
pure emotion of which I cannot 
perceive. If Mr. Walton can enter- 
tain the abstract, I accuse him of 
thinking in non-human terms. 

Concerning time travel, I will 


118 



agree that as far as it has been por- 
trayed it is apparently impossible. 
The only way I can imagine it is a 
non-effecting-observer type into the 
past which would make dry read- 
ing, unless we were to find that his- 
tory is grossly incorrect. 

I suggest he read authors Rhine, 
Hayakawa, and Korzibisky. Other 
than that I offer no authority ex- 
cept that, as a human being, I con- 
sider it my right to think. And I 
think that Mr. Walton’s stand on 
the subject should not be debated 
but rather that we should consider 
his entire “science” too aristo- 
telian. 

— Larry Martin 
Waco, Texas 

Dear JLQ : 

Mr. Walton makes several insup- 
portable statements which he evi- 
dently wishes us to accept as dog- 
ma. He says that it is inconceivable 
that a small part of the universe 
such as a man could be shifted on 
the time scale because it involves 
too many paradoxes. Infinity too 
is inconceivable and involves a 
greater number of paradoxes. Also 
the infinite numerical series, while 
never demonstrated, is impossible 
to deny. 

There are a great number of con- 
ceptions in the universe which our 
minds are incapable of grasping 
just yet; but we cannot deny them. 
I’m not being mystical; but merely 
admitting that we have not yet 
reached the peak of our mental de- 
velopment. I hope there is no peak. 

As to telepathy, he says that it is 
impossible for an abstraction to 
“produce” (a semantic error, re- 


member conservation of matter and 
energy) matter or energy. In this I 
agree, but I wish I knew what he 
meant by “abstraction”. The brain 
operates on the same laws of matter 
and energy as the telephone switch- 
board. I can see no difference ex- 
cept in complexity between broad- 
cast of emotions and of thoughts or 
pictures. Dr. Rhine has succeeded 
in finding people who, in tests 
which consist of guessing symbols 
on cards which another person is 
looking at and thinking about, have 
achieved more correct answers than 
can be accounted for by the laws of 
chance. This is not the broadcast 
of emotions but of thoughts, or 
more probably pictures. 

The October issue was very good, 
especially Prisoners of Earth and 
The Almost Men in that order of 
preference. I’m glad you have 
started a letter column, it gives 
your readers a chance to express 
their interests and opinions. 

—Bill Doying 
Chevy Chase, Maryland 

Dear Sir: 

Mr. Walton’s opinions are based 
upon the premise that it would re- 
quire an enormous flow of energy 
to move through time. I find the 
time machine that I have carried 
around on my shoulders for some 
“time” now functions with the 
small amount of energy contained 
in three meals per day. It seems to 
require no more energy for me to 
go back twenty years in “time” 
than it requires to go back twenty 
minutes. The movement seems in- 
stantaneous and without effort. It 
is my considered opinion that the 


119 



more stories and articles that are 
written about time travel, the 
sooner the public will become 
aware of the fact that their OWN 
MINDS are the only time machines 
they will ever know. 

When that which we label TIME 
is analyzed, it seems to be an illu- 
sion that is brought on by the rela- 
tional movements of the stars, suns, 
planets, etc. in the galaxy. If there 
is disagreement with this, then I 
should like to ask the question: 
What happens to TIME when we 
are in an unconscious state? 

The Almost Men was a marvel- 
ous piece of work. It required a 
knowledge of physiology, anatomy 
down to the energy level as well as 
a knowledge of the functioning of 
the mind, for Cox to write such a

Mr. Walton 3 s letter has provoked 
more heated comment than any we 
ever printed — with more to come! 

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

For shame on your quiz writer! 
He has robbed the otherwise incon- 
spicuous constellation Lyra of its 
most noble inhabitant, the brilliant 
Vega. If some relatively unimpor- 
tant star had been misplaced we 
might overlook it, but Vega! Until 
the error is corrected in print your 
magazine has joined the publica- 
tions of the astrologers in the cor- 
ner we reserve for astronomy’s 
enemies and detractors. 

— Stephen Maran 
Director, Junior Astronomy Club 

We really muffed it . and we 
apologize . Vega is not in Bootes , 
but in Lyra. 

Sirs: 

S.F. is often concerned with the 
man-machine conflict. Either the 
machines revolt or man does. Who 
decides what’s a machine? Is a stick 
used as a lever a machine? Is a 
calculator? How about a slide rule? 
Or a log table? If not, why? Or can 
this whole problem be dealt with 
by semantics? 

— Mark Langston 
South Bend, Indiana 

Okay , folks, what constitutes a ma- 
chine?
