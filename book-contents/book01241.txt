OBSERVATORY ROCKET — This observatory rocket is making a close-up stud\ 
of the Great Nebula in Andromeda, M3 1 . Like most galaxies, the Grea^ 
Nebula in Andromeda M3 1 is a vast spiral, a veritable pinwheel in space. On( 
of the nearer such astronomical spectacles, it can be seen on a clear nigh 
with the naked eye. By way of identification, it is that elongated patch of ligh 
lying between Cassiopeia and the Great Square of Pegasus. Our own Milk> 
Way is believed to be a spiral similar to M3 1 .

you're chat man, here's something chat will 
interest you. 

Not a magic formula — nor a get-rich 'quick 
scheme — but something more substantial, more 
practical. 

Of course, you need something more than just 
the desire to an accountant. You've got to pay 
the price — be willing to study earnestly, thoroughly. 

Still, wouldn’t it be worth your while to sacri- 
fice some of your leisure in favor of interesting 
home study — over a comparatively brief period.^ 
Always provided that the rewards were good — a 
salary of |4,000 to 110,000? 

An accountant’s duties are interesting, varied 
tnd of real worth to his employers. He hdiS ftanJinfi! 

Do you feel that such things aren’t for you? 
Well, don’t be too sure. Very possibly they can be! 

Why not, like so many before you. investigate 
LaSalle's modern Problem Method of training for 
an accountancy, position? 

Just suppose you were permitted to work in a 
large accounting house under the personal super- 
vision of an expert accountant. Suppose, with his 
aid, you studied accounting principles and solved 
problems day by day — easy ones at first — then 
more difficult ones. If you could do this — and 
could turn to him for advice as the problems be- 
came complex — soon you’d master them all. 

That's the training you follow in principle un- 
der the LaSalle Problem Method. 

You cover accountancy from the basic Prin- 
ciples right up through Accountancy Systems and 
Income Tax Procedure. Then you add C. P. A. 
Training and psepare for the C P. A. examina- 
tions. 

As you go along, you absorb the principles of 
Auditing, Cost Accounting, Business Law, Sta- 



tistical Control, Organization, Management and 
Finance. 

Your progress is as speedy as you care to make 
it — depending on your own eagerness to learn 
and the time you spend in study. 

Will recognition come? The only answer, as 
you know, is that success come to the man 
who is really trained. It’s possible your employers 
will notice your improvement in a very few weeks 
or months. Indeed, many LaSalle graduates have 
paid for their training — with increased earnings 
— before they have completed it! For accountants, 
who are trained in organization and management, 
are the executives of the future.

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told— you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some— but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand ^em. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws— 
their amazing discoveries of the hid* 
den processes of man*s mind, and the 
mastery of lifers problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

A CHAT WITH 
THE EDITOR 

THE OTHER DAY somebody who 
has never read a science fiction 
magazine asked me that old dog- 
eared question: “Just what is 

science fiction?” Well, Tve been 
hearing it ever since volume one, 
number one, and better men than 
I am have either been reluctant to 
answer it or have replied in some 
vague general way. I can’t do it 
“in ten words or less”, either. But 
I do like to think of it as perhaps 
the only form of fiction I know of 
which doesn’t have to follow the 
rules laid down for writing other 
types of fiction. I think science 
fiction should be a medium of 
entertainment which advances, 
worthwhile ideas and thoughts on 
the philosophy, inventions, con- 
ventions and shenanigans of Man- 
kind. I believe that a science fic- 
tion theme or premise should be 
simple and clearly plotted and con- 
vincingly told in a straightforward 



manner. And I often wonder why 
so many authors (some of them 
pretty experienced fellows, too) 
have to throw everything but the 
kitchen sink into the pot and make 
a soup you have a heck of a time 
identiifying. 

I have just finished reading a 
rather lengthy yarn with several 
rather far-fetched theories in one 
field, two or three political prem- 
ises stirred up with them, and then 
a bunch of characters, none clearly 
definable, trying to juggle the 
whole mess. Now, I’m not saying 
the juggling couldn’t be done artis- 
tically and entertainingly. My argu- 
ment is purely that if you are go- 
ing to handle all that stuff you 
gotta have elbow room in which to 
do it. Namely — in novel room, and 
then you have to be careful. But in 
a short story or novelette, stick to 
one good idea and work it out 
clearly and emphatically. If it is 
a new extrapolation of cybernetics, 
let it be that; not also an introduc- 
tion to new political theories. Or- 
iental religious tenets or gold- 
fish mutations. It makes a story 
easier to write and the chances are 
that a story that’s easy to write is 
also easy to read. 

Another thing about science fic- 
tion that should be cleared up is 
that so many non-readers never be- 
come readers because they think 
it heavy “science stuff’ and there- 
fore difficult to read. Or they 
aren’t interested in juvenile “space 
opera” and never bother to find 
out that good science fiction is not 
that at all. And while we’re on the 
subject, let’s see how a recent issue 
of “The Literary Supplement” of 
The Times of London regards sci- 
ence fiction. The issue I received 



4 



(gratis) is fat, fat, fat, consisting 
mostly of a huge section devoted to 
“American Writing Today” and all 
the paid advertisements of Ameri- 
can book publishers. This particu- 
lar section is a rather exhausting 
survey and critique of American lit- 
erature in all its forms and phases. 
Somewhere in the back part of the 
issue is an essay on science fiction 
entitled “Escaping into Space”. I 
found it interesting, for several 
reasons, and I wish you folks who 
love science fiction could read it 
(also for several reasons) . It is pre- 
cisely written; much of it is good, 
much of it is rather stuffy, a great 
part of it erroneous or uninformed. 
It is unsigned. However, to quote 
a few snatches: 

“The world of science fiction is 
essentially that of the adventure 
story, and the adventure story pure 
and simple has never held a very 
notable place in the history of lit- 
erature.” 

I could certainly argue this 
point, citing many wonderful 
American adventure classics that, 
to my warped way of thinking, have 
become a notable part of Ameri- 
can literature. I could also argue 
the point about science fiction be- 
ing “essentially” an adventure 
story. But you can, too. So I won’t 
do it here. But let’s continue: 

“Science fiction is one of the 
natural phenomena of a country 
so preoccupied with the material 
aspects of life, so predominantly 
*‘g2idget-minded” (it is remarkable 
how many science fiction stories re- 
volve around mysterious, incompre- 
hensible gadgets and the problems 
they pose) ; yet it does to some ex- 
tent echo the gradual development 



and change of direction of the 
American national conscience dur- 
ing the past thirty years. In the 
early days, these stories were pure 
adventure-tales: pioneers shot off 
into space, landed on distant worlds 
and found enough thrills and hor- 
rific aborigines there to titillate the 
most jaded reader’s palate. They 
were very much an extension of the 
hero-cult common to all books writ- 
ten for juvenile readers the world 
over. But this era is now somewhat 
contemptuously dismissed as the 
bug-eyed monster phase and science 
fiction has made efforts to grow up. 
Those early writers who have not 
drifted off into other fields have 
set about improving the standard 
of their original, rather crude tales 
and some are even striving to give 
their work a deeper significance”. 

I agree that America is “gadget- 
minded”, but that isn’t the reason 
for science fiction. If only one half 
of the gadget-minded people in 
this country read science fiction, a 
dozen different science fiction mag- 
azines wouldn’t have folded in the 
past year. Publishing a science fic- 
tion magazine, contrary to what 
this British writer thinks, is no 
gravy train. The audience is small, 
and not as he (or she?) states: 

“Broadly speaking, science fic- 
tion can be placed in the same class 
as the ever-popular Western and 
appeals to the same type of public”. 

I like westerns too, but — oh boy! 
— ^what a difference in the audi- 
ence! 

“If science fiction does much to 
illustrate the development of a na- 
tional neurosis, it also expresses 
man’s pioneering spirit, his cease-

The Lut and the Snorap were philosophical engineers of high 
and ancient orders; and they were very wise in the ways of 
all types of life. However, they were now experiencing some- 
thing new — the struggle for existence of two human beings . 

The Odd Ones 

BY GORDON DICKSON 



Illustrated by Ed Emsh 




S AID THE Snorap, sitting down 
with a thump, “This I do not 
understand.” 

“They are young,” replied the 
Lut, settling on his haunches beside 
the Snorap. “Young and stupid.” 
“I agree they are young,” said 
the Snorap. “I am not yet con- 
vinced they are stupid. But how 
can they expect to persist?” 

Persist, of course, was not exact- 
ly the word the Snorap used. It 
was something with more scope 
than the mere idea of persisting. It 
dealt with continuing to survive, 
and a social and racial sense as 
well as maintaining a present ef- 
fort. However, the Lut understood. 

They were of different races 
these two; but equally old and ex- 
perienced in the ways of the uni- 
verse. Both had evolved to cope 
with the varying conditions to be 




found in space and on many dif- 
ferent worlds, and though the end 
product of each race’s evolution 
had resulted in some difference, in 
essence they were similar. Neither 
of them, for example, required an 
atmosphere; and they could fuel 
their bodies with almost any chem- 
ical compound which would give 
off energy in the process of being 
broken down into its component 
parts. At a pinch, they could even 
get by on solar radiation, though 
this was an unsatisfying form of 
diet. Fleshed and muscled to meet 
truly fantastic gravities, pressures, 
and temperature extremes, they 
were at home just about anywhere. 

These were the common points. 
In appearance each race had set- 
tled on a form of its own. The 
Snorap strongly resembled a very 
fat and sleepy lizard about ten feet 
in length — a sort of unterrifying, 
overs tufifed dragon of the kind who 
would prefer a pleasant nap in a 
soft chair to eating maidens, any 
day in the week. His hide was 
heavy and dark and ridged like ar- 
mor-plating. 

The Lut, on the other hand, was 
built more on the model of an 
Earthly tiger, except that he was 
longer — being fully as long as the 
Snorap — and thicker, with an al- 
most perfectly round body, rather 
like a big sewer main. He was tail- 
less, his head was big and flat of 
face, and he possessed an enormous 
jaw which could crunch boulders 
like hard candy. His eyes had a 
fierce green glint to them and he 
was covered with very fine, but in- 
credibly tough, small glassy scales 
which would have permitted him 
to take an acid shower every morn- 
ing and never notice it at all. But 



7 




in spite of his appearance, he was 
just as civilized, just as intelligent, 
and just as much a gentleman as 
the Snorap; which put them both, 
as a matter of fact, several notches 
above the two humans they were 
watching, in all those respects. 

The two aliens were philosophi- 
cal engineers, an occupation it is 
hard to explain in human terms. It 
might be attempted by saying that 
every living being, no matter how 
far down the intelligence scale it 
may be, has a sort of inherent phi- 
losophy of survival. When the phi- 
losophies of all life forms on one 
world balance nicely, there is no 
problem. When they fall out of 
balance with one another, the 
philosophical engineer moves in, 
hoping to correct the situation and 
incidentally, gain new knowledge. 

These two, the Snorap and the 
Lut, had discovered this world they 
were on to be a new one, not here- 
tofore checked, and they had just 
spent the last eighty years or so in 
going over it. Their own ship— 
which was more of a space-sled 
than a ship, being completely open, 
except for an energy shield for me- 
teor protection — was clear on the 
other side of the planet, they hav- 
ing wandered away from it com- 
pletely in the past half-century of 
philosophy-testing. Now they had 
just stumbled on a pair of human 
immigrants. These soft little bipeds 
were a new experience to the 
Snorap and the Lut, neither of 
their races having encountered the 
type before; and they sat in the ob- 
scurity of the vegetation that 
hemmed the little clearing where 
the human ship had landed, con- 
versing in something that was not 
verbal speech, sign language, nor 

8 



telepathy, but a mixture of all 
three — and they marveled. 

‘T do not understand it,” repeat- 
ed the Snorap. ‘T literally fail to 
comprehend. They will most cer- 
tainly perish.” 

“Undoubtedly,” replied the Lut, 
blinking his green eyes. “They be- 
lieve in their machines, I think.” 
He indicated the domed metal hut 
and the low hydroponics tank- 
building, like the top half of a loaf 
of bread cut off and set close to 
the ground, and the small ship be- 
yond, from which the two human 
figures were laboring to extract the 
motors for their power plant. The 
planet was at the hot end of its 
summer and the temperature was 
above a hundred and forty degrees 
fahrenheit, a fact the Snorap and 
the Lut did not even notice. The 
humans sweated in conditioned 
clothing and face masks. 

“But that is no way to meet the 
challenge of environment,” said the 
Snorap, quite honestly distressed. 
“No way at all. Suppose the ma- 
chines fail? They will shrivel in the 
sun or congeal in the cold.” 

“I give them four months,” said 
the Lut, snapping his heavy jaws 
closed. 

“I’m afraid so,” said the Snorap. 
“Their home world must be badly 
out of balance if they take the easy 
way of machines instead of trying 
to adapt. There can be no endur- 
ance, no philosophical strength in 
such creatures. Their original plan- 
et must be very badly off. I won- 
der where it is?” 

“When the machines break 
down, they will have to leave,” said 
the Lut. “We will follow.” 

And with entirely inhuman pa- 
tience, the two settled themselves 

GORDON DICKSON 




in the shadow and shelter of the 
vegetation to wait. 

W HAT ARE they doing now?” 
asked the Lut. 

He had been napping for the 
past two weeks; leaving the Snorap 
to observe. The Snorap, who slept 
only during the process of regrow- 
ing a lost limb, was quite obvious- 
ly fascinated. 

“They’ve been getting ready for 
winter,” he answered. 

“Oh, winter,” said the Lut, get- 
ting up and stretching himself like 
the big cat he somewhat resem- 
bled. “That’s right.” 

The planet they were on did not 
tilt on its axis, but had an orbit 
that carried it quite well out from 
its sun during the shorter part of 
the year. The result was a brief, 
but very severe winter. The tem- 
perature had, in fact, fallen a good 
hundred degrees since they had 
first sighted the human clearing; 
but neither the Snorap nor the Lut 
paid any attention to this, a differ- 
ence so minor hardly registered on 
their senses. 

Under a heavy, gray sky, the hu- 
mans were working feverishly to 
bank up the living dome, the hy- 
droponics tank-building and the 
ship. They had set up the ship’s 
motors in a little structure off to 
one side, with a thick pipe-like af- 
fair running from it to the dome 
and off to the hydroponics build- 
ing. The Lut cocked his eye at the 
banks of earth. 

“Why?” he asked. 

“Insulation, I would imagine,” 
replied the Snorap. 

“It won’t work,” said the Lut. 
“The blizzards will blow it away.” 

THE ODD ONES 



“Not if it freezes first,” said the 
Snorap. “They are ingenious.” 
“Now I suppose they’ll go inside 
and hole up until the warmth 
comes,” said the Lut. “An under- 
ground sort of existence.” He 
looked across the chill earth to 
where the two humans were labor- 
ing with hand shovels to pile the 
crumbly brown soil of the planet 
against the side of the motor-build- 
ing. “How do you tell them apart?” 
“They are almost identical, aren’t 
they?” said the Snorap. “However, 
if you take the trouble to figure it 
out, you’ll notice one has a slightly 
greater mass than the other. I call 
them the Greater Biped Colonist 
and the Lesser Biped Colonist. 
Great and Less for short. That’s 
Great going around the comer of 
the motor building right now. And 
Less is still digging.” 

“I wonder why there are two of 
them? said the Lut thoughtfully. 

“There are two of us,” said the 
Snorap. 

“Of course,” said the Lut, “but 
there’s reason for that. We’re dif- 
ferent life forms. Our senses and 
abilities complement each other. 
But these two are exact duplicates. 
Doesn’t make sense.” 

“Nonsense,” retorted the Snorap. 
“There could be all sorts of pos- 
sible explanations. For instance one 
might be a spare.” 

“A spare?” 

“What’s so fantastic about that?” 
said the Snorap. “Consider how 
fragile they are; and how far they 
are, undoubtedly, from their home 
world.” 

“All the same,” said the Lut, 
snapping his big jaws shut, “I can- 
not agree with such a hypothesis. It 
is unmoral in the extreme.” 



9 




“I merely offered it as one pos- 
sible explanation of why there were 
two of them,” replied the Snorap, 
glancing at his friend and com- 
panion. “While you’ve been nap- 
ping I’ve devoted a lot of time to 
close observation of them. Do you 
know what I deduce?” 

“Don’t ask rhetorical questions,” 
grumbled the Lut. 

“They haven’t been civilized for 
more than eight or ten thousand 
years.” 

“What? Ridiculous!” snorted the 
Lut. “Obviously they’re young; but 
eight to ten thousand is utterly fan- 
tastic.” 

“Not when you stop to consider 
this philosophical imbalance that 
has driven them to the production 
of machines for any and every pos- 
sible use. That in itself is the worst 
possible danger signal. Undoubted- 
ly it has sapped all of their moral 
fiber.” 

“I might point out,” said the 
Lut, “that, to migrate to a world 
like this when you are like that, 
takes a certain amoimt of moral 
fiber.” 

“Ah, but there we come to an- 
other question,” persisted the 
Snorap, interlocking the big, blunt 
claws of his forepaws together like 
a pedantic old man. “What reason 
can they have for coming here? 
They show no intellectual interest 
in the planet. Their senses are ob- 
viously very limited. They seem to 
have no purpose in being here other 
than to exist.” 

“Under great difficulties,” said 
the Lut. 

“Granted,” answered the Snorap, 
“under great difficulties. Which 
merely confirms my belief in their 
unbalance.” 



The Lut was by nature a con- 
trary creature; and in addition he 
was always snappish after a nap. 

“And I,” he retorted, “prefer to 
assume that there may be some 
good reason which you and I are 
too dull-witted to understand.” 

“My dear fellow — ” protested 
the Snorap, aghast. 

“Why not?” The Lut sat down 
rather complacently. “Simply be- 
cause you and I know and under- 
stand the philosophies of some hun- 
dreds of thousands of different in- 
telligent life forms, it does not nec- 
essarily follow that we will be able 
to know and understand this one. 
Now does it?” 

“No, but — but — the Snorap 
was actually floundering in the sea 
of the Lut’s sophistical argument. 

“You will have to admit,” said 
the Lut, “that there is room for 
reasonable doubt. Let us clarify 
the argument. You say that ma- 
chines have sapped their moral fi- 
ber. Therefore, it is clear that with- 
out their machines they will show 
no instinct or capability for surviv- 
al. Is this not so?” 

“Exactly,” said the Snorap, stem- 

ly- 

“And I,” went on the Lut, “dis- 
agree. I do not understand, any 
more than you do, what they are 
doing here, why there are two of 
them, or what their philosophy of 
life is. But I claim that no mem- 
bers of a race which has made a 
migration to a world where condi- 
tions are so inhospitable to them, 
as this one, can be lacking in moral 
fiber. Now, I propose that we aban- 
bon our work on this planet tem- 
porarily, and observe these two in- 
stead — ^until we come to a conclu- 
sion.”

GORDON DICKSON 




*‘And if I should turn out to be 
right,” countered the Snorap, stiffly, 
“do you agree to locating their 
home planet and doing a thorough 
job of philosophical re-balancing 
on this race?” 

“I do,” replied the Lut. “But 
what if I should turn out to be 
right. What concession will you 
make?” 

“Concession?” said the Snorap, 
blinking. 

“Certainly,” said the Lut. “It’s 
only fair that I should stand to gain 
something as well. If I am right, do 
you agree to introducing ourselves 
to them; and introducing them to 
the fact that many other intelli- 
gent races exist, of radically differ- 
ent philosophies?” 

“I do,” said the Snorap. He 
turned his heavy lizard-like muzzle 
to the sky. “And here comes the 
winter to seal the bargain and ad- 
minister the first environmental test 
to our subjects.” 

From the dark sky, a first few 
snowflakes were falling. Around the 
buildings. Great and Less, the two 
odd little bipeds, tamped their last 
shovels-full of earth into place; 
and went inside the domed living 
quarters. The day wore on and 
darkness came swiftly. The ground 
was covered now with snow and 
the air was thick with swirling 
flakes. 

The wind rose to a banshee roar, 
tugging and tearing at the build- 
ings and the freezing earth banked 
up around their perimeters. 

T WO WEEKS later, by the plan- 
et’s local time, the snow ceased 
blowing, the distant winter sun 
came out, and the temperature 

THE ODD ONES 



dropped sharply to about eighty 
degrees below zero fahrenheit. Be- 
hind the denuded branches of the 
vegetation surrounding the clear- 
ing, but almost as well shielded by 
their twisted tangle as they had 
been when leaves sprouted from 
the black limbs, the Snorap and 
Lut sat in the snow, watching the 
dome. 

“What are they doing in there?” 
the Lut kept asking. The Snorap’s 
sense of hearing was more adapt- 
able than that of the tigerish alien; 
and he had been keeping his com- 
panion posted on what went on 
out of their sight. 

“They’re talking,” replied the 
Snorap. 

“Still?” said the Lut, registering 
astonishment. “How can a strictly 
verbal language contain enough 
concepts to permit of prolonged 
discussion?” 

“I don’t understand it myself,” 
answered the Snorap. He had been 
trying to learn the biped language 
from what he could overhear. “A 
lot of their talk doesn’t make 
sense.” 

“Multi - purpose expressions?” 
said the Lut, who ordinarily was 
something of a linguist himself. 

“ — No — ” replied the Snorap. 

“Dropped metaphors?” persisted 
the Lut, thinking of a little known 
race on the fringe of the Magel- 
lenic cloud. 

“No,” said the Snorap. 

“Elided constantual hyperbo — ” 

“No!” said the Snorap, thorough- 
ly exasperated. “It just doesn’t 
make sense. The language is sim- 
ple enough, it’s the way they use 
it. They call each other by so many 
different names I don’t know 
which is which any more — ”

( Inside the dome, Great had just 
adA^essed Less as a tin-headed 
idiot.) 

“Utter, utter, utter illogic and 
confusion!” stormed the Snorap. 

“Take a rest,” suggested the Lut. 
“Forget about them for a while and 
let’s have a talk about relative grav- 
itic strains in a forty-body system.” 

Gravitic strains were the Snorap’s 
hobby at the present and had been 
for the past two hundred years. 
Grumblingly, he allowed himself 
to be persuaded. He and the Lut 
withdrew their attention from the 
clearing. 

Great and Less grew sleepy and 
went to bed. 

Unnoticed by human or alien, a 
pipe in the hydroponics building 
that was too close to the deadly 
cold of the outer wall, burst. Liq- 
uid sprayed from it onto the floor 
of the building; and gradually, but 
with an inexorable steadiness, the 
level of the nutrient fluid in the 
planting tanks began to go down. 

“I blame myself,” said the Sno- 
rap, miserably. “I blame myself.” 

“What for?” snapped the Lut. 
“We aren’t here to protect them. 
We’re waiting around to see if they 
have any moral fiber. I should 
think you’d be pleased by the whole 
thing.” 

“Pleased!” said the Snorap. 

They had just been watching 
Great and Less as they struggled in 
temperatures that were now below 
the hundred-below-zero mark, to 
transfer what could be salvaged 
from the hydroponics building to 
their living-dome. Helmeted and 
bundled in heavy suits, they had 
been losing ground in their salvage 
effort. Finally, in desperation they 

12 



had cut down on clothing and had 
substituted improvised face masks. 
This permitted them to carry more 
on each trip, but rendered them 
more vulnerable to the cold. Less 
had collapsed twice before giving 
up; and Great had finished the job 
alone. Apparently he had a touch 
of frostbite in his lungs, though. 
Less was doing what their meager 
stock of medical equipment per- 
mitted, to mend the condition. 

The Snorap, sitting with the Lut 
in the shelter of a drift, had suf- 
fered for the bipeds as he watched 
them work. The truth of the mat- 
ter was that the Snorap balanced a 
tendency toward gloomy judge- 
ments with a very soft heart indeed. 

“Are you convinced now?” asked 
the Lut. 

The Snorap shook himself back 
into a less emotional frame of mind. 

“No,” he said. “No. They didn’t 
sit down and fold their hands when 
their machine failed, true. But we 
— I — am concerned with a matter 
of proper racial philosophy. What 
strength have these creatures aside 
from the strength of their machines 
and their own strength to make 
more? What else have they? Here 
we have only one machine that has 
failed. What if they all failed? 
What if the idea of machines 
failed? They must prove that it is 
more than their pride in their abil- 
ity to build that has given them 
reason to think that they can suc- 
cessfully dare strange worlds.” 

“Humph!” said the Lut. 

“But a race cannot grow with- 
out a proper philosophy, you know 
that,” said the Snorap, almost 
pleading with him. 

“Well—” growled the Lut. “I 
think I’ll go for a walk. Need some 

GORDON DICKSON 




exercise.” He turned and loped off 
into the snow. When he reached 
a level spot out of sight of the 
Snorap he turned on the speed, and 
the barren winter plains were treat- 
ed to the sight of him burning up 
his ill-humor at the rate of better 
than a hundred miles an hour. For 
the Lut was in a bad temper and 
did not quite like to ask himself 
why. 

The Snorap, left alone, looked 
doubtfully at the buildings in the 
clearing. 

‘T don’t think I’m too hard on 
them,” he said. “I don’t think I 
am — 



T he short winter wore itself 
out ; and spring came in with a 
rush. The snow disappeared; and 
the ground around the buildings be- 
came brown mud. Great, fully re- 
covered, and Less could be seen 
daily extending the clearing in the 
direction of a stream that ran from 
the hills west of their buildings 
down onto the plain below. 

“Now, what’s the point of that?” 
the Lut asked the Snorap. 

“I’m not sure,” answered the 
Snorap. “It has something to do 
with the hydroponics building.” 
They both turned to look at the 
corpse of that ill-fated piece of bi- 
ped machinery. The hydroponics 
tank-building had been, indeed, a 
little miracle of compact and effi- 
cient mechanical engineering. Sin- 
gle parts and sections had had num- 
bers of different functions. The re- 
sult was that by bad luck, when 
that single pipe had burst, it had 
started off a chain of breakdowns; 
which, in the incredible cold of the 
winter, had ended by destroying the 

THE ODD ONES 



building^s use completely. Neither 
the Snorap nor the Lut could see 
what good might be gotten out of 
it now. 

They found out a few days later, 
when Great and Less began to plant 
in the muddy soil the seeds and 
shoots from the vegetable things 
they had saved. The soil itself they 
treated with chemicals and other 
necessary ingredients from the 
ruined building. 

“Very clever,” approved the Lut. 
He turned to the Snorap. “How do 
you like that?” 

“Very good,” said the Snorap. 
“But may I point out that if they 
are to prove themselves by doing 
without their machines, they’ll have 
to do without all of them?” 

“You might give them credit for 
this anyway,” said the Lut. 

“I do,” the Snorap answered. “It 
is, truthfully, a vtery creditable step 
and one I had never expected from 
them.” 

“If the crops prosper, they can 
extend their planting,” the Lut 
pointed out. 

“That is true.” 

“ — ^And with the long summer 
they have on this world they can 
probably get in two or three crops 
before the next winter.” 

“The possibility,” said the Sno- 
rap politely, “had not entirely es- 
caped my notice.” 

The year warmed gradually. For 
a matter of weeks there was anx- 
iousness in human and alien hearts 
alike, until the first shoots of the 
planted things began to show their 
heads above the brown soil. 

“Beautiful,” said the Snorap, one 
dark night, looking over the field 
with the Lut. He bent down to 



13 




touch the soft firmness of a soft 
green spear-tip. His night vision, 
like the Lut’s was fully equal to the 
task of appreciating it in full color, 
although the humans would hard- 
ly have been able to see their hands 
before their faces. “Here indeed is 
beauty, and strength and purpose. 
In alien soil it fights as valiantly 
toward the light of a strange sun 
as ever it fought for the light of its 
native star from the womb of its 
natural earth.” 

“It and the bipeds are probably 
sons of the same mother world,” re- 
marked the Lut. 

“Almost undoubtedly,” answered 
the Snorap, abandoning the plant 
and straightening up. “But there 
are good and bad on all worlds, as 
you well know, my friend.” 

The ice-green eyes of the Lut 
softened to turquoise. 

“Except on Lut,” he said. 

“And Snorap,” added the Sno- 
rap. “And some few others where 
the creatures have grown older and 
attained wisdom ...” His words 
trailed off ; and they stood together 
in silence for a moment, each think- 
ing of the world that was his home. 
. “I will go home one of these 
days,” said the Lut. 

“I, too,” answered the Snorap. 
He paused, looking off toward the 
eastern horizon, beyond which he 
could sense the approaching dawn. 
“What drives us, Lut? All the many 
myriadillions of us; all so different 
in so many ways and alike in one. 
What is this inescapable con- 
comitant of intelligence, that a 
thinking being should be always 
hungry for the new and always 
wistful for the past?” 

“I do not know,” replied the 
Lut, “it is beyond philosophy.” 

14 



“So many things,” said the Sno- 
rap, “are beyond philosophy — ” 
They were feeling the weight of 
the universe as all thinking beings 
do, when they open their souls to 
the unknown. In their hearts they 
stood with bowed heads before the 
Mother of all Mysteries, the great 
and final Why? which is never an- 
swered, but merely moved back a 
step by those who win knowledge. 
The mood lasted for perhaps die 
space of five minutes ; and then they 
had come back to their ordinary 
selves again. 

“I gave them four months,” said 
the Lut. “That time is up already.” 
“And I at least,” said the Snorap, 
“am no closer to understanding 
their basic philosophy, if, truly, it 
is not that the machine is the an- 
swer to all problems.” 

“They have a strong will toward 
survival.” 

“I must admit it,” replied the 
Snorap. “But that by itself is pure 
animal, non-thinking animal. And 
while we do not condemn the an- 
imal, we do not reach out our 
hands to him in friendship as you 
want us to do with these bipeds.” 
“I have a hunch,” said the Lut. 
“Real or wishful?” asked the 
Snorap. They were talking about 
a subconscious reasoning process 
that both knew to exist, but both 
instinctively distrusted. 

“I don’t know,” said the Lut. 
“But their pattern of living is at 
odds with the conditions here. I 
foresee trouble.” 



S UMMER approached. The 
earth dried under a swelling sun 
and thrust forth the fruit of the bi- 
peds’ planting. Great and Less har- 

GORDON DICKSON 




vested feverishly under a cloudless 
sky, while the south winds that blew 
steadily now, grew stronger and 
warmer, day by day. 

Finally the crops were all in and 
the ground re-planted. From the 
wreckage of the hydroponics build- 
ing they had constructed a gran- 
ary; and this was stocked with all 
that they had brought in. With the 
strengthening winds and the heat 
came dust storms blown up over the 
empty plains and carried up the 
slopes into the shallow hills where 
Great and Less had built. Behind 
the screen of the new-grown veg- 
etation behind the clearing, the 
Lut and the Snorap watched an 
area in which the humans were sel- 
dom seen. Heat as fierce in its own 
way as the cold of the winter past, 
held them virtual prisoners in the 
dome. 

*‘It is not good for them,” the 
Snorap informed the Lut. 

“Why?” asked the Lut. An 
eighty mile-an-hour gale was sand- 
blasting away at his scales, without 
apparently affecting them, beyond 
polishing them up so that they 
shone more brightly. 

“The wind. The sound of the 
wind,” said the Snorap. “And the 
fact that they cannot go outside. 
They are often nervous and angry 
at one another without reason.” 

“The season will pass,” said the 
Lut indifferently. “One day the 
winds will start to drop; and then 
it will be fall.” 

— And, of course, eventually it 
happened. The bipeds came forth 
at last into a temperature of a little 
over a hundred degrees. The wind 
had dropped steadily for nearly a 
week. Now it shifted suddenly to 
the north — and the rains came. 



Gently at first; and then with 
increasing violence, they poured 
down on the dusty earth. The 
ground p u ff e d , soaked, and 
steamed in the short intervals of 
sunshine. And after several weeks 
the two went out to examine the 
fields they had planted for the sec- 
ond growing season. 

They found a muddy desert. 

With time growing short before 
the winter, they had to break into 
the stored treasure of the granery 
and gamble that one more crop 
could be gotten in before the frost 
came. 

“Do you think they’ll have 
time?” the Lut asked Snorap. 

“I don’t know,” replied the 
Snorap. “Theoretically they should. 
But will these crops grow as fast as 
those planted at the start of the 
summer?” 

“Hum,” said the Lut, thought- 
fully. “Well, they’ve got an even 
chance, anyway.” 

Over the months, the Lut and 
the Snorap had grown sensitive to 
small changes in the two bipeds. 
But they were not perceptive 
enough to sense that the constant 
struggle for existence had strained 
the nerves of both humans to the 
breaking point. Indeed, they were 
living together now, through this 
second planting, like two caged an- 
imals, avoiding each other as much 
as possible for fear that a chance 
word would bring them into open 
conflict. This, the two aliens did 
not sense. Only the physical ele- 
ments got through to them. 

“Their mass has gone down,” the 
Lut remarked critically to the 
Snorap one afternoon in late sum- 
mer as the two sat watching the 

15 



THE ODD ONES 




bowed figures readying the clearing 
for the approaching winter. 

“Possibly they do not have 
enough food/’ answered the Snorap. 

“I don’t think that’s it,” said 
the Lut thoughtfully. “More likely 
it is overexertion. They are exer- 
cising themselves for long hours 
these last few weeks.” 

“They talk less,” said the Snorap. 

“And they do not laugh,” added 
the Lut, who had finally gotten 
around to mastering the biped 
language and was able to grasp the 
difference between laughter and 
speech. “But maybe when the crop 
starts to show itself above ground 
they will cheer up.” 

“The visual emergence of new 
life into the world always has a 
stimulating effect,” said the Sno- 
rap. “For those capable of under- 
standing, it connotes the ever-fresh 
wonder of existence renewed.” 

“I was thinking more,” said the 
Lut, “of what those crops mean to 
them in terms of food through the 
winter.” 

“That, of course, too,” agreed 
the Snorap, a little miffed at being 
interrupted in his philosophizing. 

But the first sight of the second 
crop pushing its way through the 
brown soil did have the good effect 
the Lut had anticipated. The two 
bipeds relaxed and fell once more 
into an easy, happy relationship be- 
tween themselves. This second har- 
vest came more slowly, indeed, but 
the growth was strong and hardy; 
and the yield, if anything, a shade 
heavier. 

But now, with the ripening of the 
planted things, the native life of 
the planet came to prey upon the 
growing fields. Where they had 

16 



been during the sterile winter, and 
through the fresh spring and the 
blasting heat of mid-summer, it 
was impossible to tell. It seemed 
vaguely to Great and Less that they 
had noticed some native life 
around before, but never paid a 
great deal of attention to it. The 
smallest came first — insects of all 
sizes and tiny animals ; and the 
two bipeds, working late, dug a 
deep moat around their planted 
ground and filled it with water di- 
verted from the stream beyond the 
fields. After these came larger an- 
imals; and for a few nights one or 
the other was always on duty all 
night long with a missile-hurling de- 
vice that the Lut and the Snorap 
recognised as a weapon — for the 
larger animals came only in the 
hours of darkness when the bipeds 
were not visible in the fields. 

This last fact finally struck home 
to the mind of Great, and the Lut 
and the Snorap saw him out in the 
fields one day, setting posts about 
their perimeters. On each post was 
a short, thick tube and from each 
post to the next ran what looked 
like heavy black rope. That night 
they went forth to investigate after 
dark. 

“Cable,” said the Snorap, pick- 
ing up a section of it, “designed to 
conduct some form of energy. Gome 
to think of it, I did notice Less 
working around the power-house; 
but I was so interested in what 
Great was doing out here, I didn’t 
pay much attention. Now I won- 
der—” 

At that moment, at the furthest 
end of the field, one of the tubes 
atop a post seemed suddenly to 
explode and throw out colored balls 
of fixe at a great rate. It was, in 

GORDON DICKSON 




fact, nothing more than a self-re- 
fueling roman candle, although 
that particular comparison did not 
occur to either the Snorap nor the 
Lut, in spite of the fact that they 
understood the nature of the thing 
almost instantly. Hardly had the 
pyrotechnics of the first ceased, 
when the next one up the border 
of the field burst out and lit up its 
own section. The Lut and the 
Snorap drew back into the dark- 
ness. 

“There!” said the Lut in tri- 
umph. “You see the difference? 
The biped does not depend on the 
machine. It is a tool that he uses 
as he sees fit.” 

The Snorap turned his heavy 
head and looked at his companion. 

“Well?” demanded the Lut. “You 
must admit that I’m right. Listen!” 
The sensitive hearing of the two 
ranged out into the darkness be- 
hind them. “The wild ones are 
frightened and drawing away.” 

“I admit it,” said the Snorap 
ponderously. “But all through this 
business you have made it a practise 
to misunderstand me. It is not how 
the biped uses the tool that is im- 
portant. It is whether he can lay 
aside the tool. It is whether he can 
attempt something where the tool 
will not aid him. It is his ability to 
conceive of meeting a problem 
without tools. When he shows evi- 
dence of that, and only then will I 
be willing and proud to face him 
and call him brother.” 

The Lut’s eyes glowed with 
green anger. 

“You are being unfair,” he said. 
“The centuries past have taught 
me your nature. You mistrust your 
own softness of emotion which 
kindles an instinctive fellow feeling 

THE ODD ONES 



between you and the bipeds. In 
your efforts to be impartial you 
lean over backwards and place the 
benefit of the doubt against them.” 

There was enough truth in this 
to make the Snorap wince in- 
wardly. 

“After all those same centuries,” 
he retorted bitterly, “must we de- 
scend to personal criticism?” 

“Truth is truth!” said the Lut. 
And his great jaws rang shut to- 
gether. “Your conclusions are your 
own.” 

“And I stand by them!” said the 
Snorap. 

“And I by mine!” 

For a moment they stood facing 
each other. Then the Snorap 
turned away and headed back to 
the shelter of their accustomed 
vegetation. The Lut stood watch- 
ing him go for a minute; then he 
also turned and headed out away 
from the clearing, to run the plains 
and think himself back to reason- 
ableness. 

In the dome, the two exhausted 
humans slept their first good night 
of sleep in weeks. 

Two days later they began their 
harvesting. By the end of the first 
day they had gathered in the prod- 
uce of perhaps a fifth of their 
fields. And on the second day of 
harvesting. Less staggered suddenly 
and sat down. Watching in a mu- 
tual silence from which the old 
friendly warmth was still missing, 
the Lut and the Snorap saw Great 
break off his own work and run 
to the fallen biped. 

“For God’s sake, don’t quit 
now!” they heard him say. 

“I can’t,” said Less, looking up 

17 




from the ground. “I can’t do any 
more.” 

“We’ve got to get this stuff in!” 
cried Great, helplessly. 

“One day — ” Less forced the 
words through worn lips “let’s take 
one day off. I can’t go any more, 
I tell you!” 

“Something may go wrong — 

Less stirred and weakly rose; 
then turned toward the dome. 

“The weather’s good. The gadg- 
et you made will keep the beasts 
out. There’s no point to killing our- 
selves. I’ve got to get some sleep.” 

For a long moment Great stood 
watching the other biped move 
slowly off toward the dome. Sud- 
denly, he cursed. He threw down 
the tool he was holding and fol- 
lowed. 

The Snorap and the Lut turned 
to look at each other. 

“They are giving up,” said the 
Snorap. “They are leaving the 
machine to guard the field.” 

The Lut faced him. 

“I don’t blame them,” he said. 

“To me,” replied the Snorap, 
“they are failures.” 

They stood looking at each other. 

“I think,” said the Lut at last, 
“I think that we no longer possess 
the mutual understanding necessary 
to our partnership.” 

The Snorap bowed his head. 

“I cannot disagree,” he said. 

There was pain in both of them. 

“Our association in the past has 
been a long and good one,” said 
the Lut. “I will remember it.” 

“Nor will I forget,” said the 
Snorap. He paused. “I will wait 
here a little while yet to see the end 
of this.” 

“I will wait also, then,” the Lut 
answered. 

18 



They stood facing each other. 
Suddenly, the Snorap raised his 
head and tilted it, listening to the 
southward. After a second the 
Lut’s head followed suit. 

“ — And the end comes now,” 
said the Snorap. 

T here are monsters on all 
young worlds. The creature 
that came northward over the 
plains, migrating with the seasons 
from tropics to temperate zone, was 
a proof of that statement. Vege- 
tarian but vast, in size and strength 
beyond all natural enemies of his 
world, his body was all head, horns 
and stomach, balanced on four pil- 
lar-like legs; and he followed the 
comfortable temperatures of cool 
autumns northward, gleaning the 
land as he went. 

From far out on the dark plains, 
he had scented the bipeds’ crops. 
But because he stood at that time 
up to his tremendous midlegs in 
soft second growth grass, he had 
not turned immediately but had 
continued to feed where he was. 
When dawn came he had slept, 
standing with rock-like motionless- 
ness upon his pillar legs. But when 
the midday breeze brought a scent 
of the ripe growing stuff once more 
to his flaring nostrils, he had stirred 
out of his sleep and method- 
ically began to feed toward the 
clearing. 

The Lut looked at the Snorap 
and the Snorap looked away. 

The beast came on toward the 
edge of the field, moving with in- 
exorable ponderousness. Some fifty 
yards away impatience seemed to 
break through his normal calm, 
and abandoning his slow feeding 

GORDON DICKSON 




pace, he lifted his head and broke 
into a sudden trot toward the 
orderly rows of cultivation. 

Still — amazingly — he made al- 
most no sound with his feet. The 
vibration, rather than the noise of 
his swinging stride, quivered 
through the earth and was felt by 
the Snorap and the Lut. Nothing 
could have been more eerie than 
this huge monster, looming large 
even in comparison with the build- 
ings in the clearing, running si- 
lently toward the deserted fields 
under the bright, cloudless sky of 
the afternoon. 

In the dome, the vibration 
reached through the fogs of Great’s 
sleep, and stirred him. He moved, 
groaned, and opened his eyes. He 
lay on his back, listening, with his 
eyes open. 

The monster had reached the 
edge of the field. He slowed and 
halted, the burnt metal smell of 
the roman candle pots stirred his 
little brain to caution. Slowly he 
moved up the line of cable to the 
nearest one and sniffed at it, the 
sound of his heavy snuffling audible 
to the Snorap and Lut behind their 
screen of branches. 

Suddenly he screamed — a fan- 
tastic sound that rolled and re- 
echoed between open earth and 
empty sky. And, lifting himself on 
his hind legs, he pounded with both 
forelegs on the post, driving it into 
the dusty ground. And, as if this 
action had set loose the fires of his 
rage, he began almost to dance on 
the remains of the heavy post, 
mashing it to matchstick wood. 

From the dome. Great and Less 
came tumbling. Less, half asleep 
and reeling with fatigue. Great 
cursing and trying to arm the weap- 

THE ODD ONES 



on he carried — the gun the Sno- 
rap and Lut had seen him use 
when he tried to drive away the 
night predators on the fields. Fin- 
ally dropping on one knee he fired 
at the monster. A puff of dust rose 
from behind the creature’s heavy 
shoulder, and it turned to charge 
the human. 

Great had aimed instinctively for 
where the heart is on animals of 
his native world. But this creature 
now bearing down upon him had no 
heart — as Snorap and Lut could 
have told Great. His circulatory 
fluid was literally pumped through 
his body by little muscles lining his 
veins and arteries. 

Great fired again — this time for 
the head. And the missile rico- 
cheted from the heavy bone plates 
as from a granite boulder. 

The Snorap made an unhappy 
sound. 

The second shot had caused the 
monster to hesitate. Now, weaving 
its head back and forth, it caught 
sight of Less and turned after this 
new quarry. Less took one panic- 
stricken glance at the towering 
creature; and ran blindly into the 
open space that separated the clear- 
ing from the fields. 

Great fired twice more before 
the gun jammed. By that time, the 
monster was upon Less. But, fan- 
tastically, because of its speed and 
huge bulk, it overran the fleeing 
biped, and Less stumbled and fell 
without being touched. 

For perhaps two seconds, while 
the monster was slowing and turn- 
ing, Great continued to wrestle with 
the weapon. Then, seizing it by 
the barrel and swinging it like a 
club, he ran forward toward the 
creature. 



19 




“What is this?” cried the Snorap. 

The monster had wheeled now 
and stood confronting them both. 
Great passed the fallen Less, shout- 
ing “Get to the dome. Get to the 
dome! Fll hold him!” 

The monster screamed his fury 
and turned to follow; and Great 
ran on, a living lure to give Less 
time to reach safety. 

“No moral fiber, eh?” snarled 
the Lut, leaping to his feet. He 
started to spring from concealment, 
but the Snorap gripped him. 

“I will go!” cried the Snorap. “I 
was wrong. It’s my responsibility.” 

“But my pleasure!” growled the 
Lut. “You take care of the bipeds.” 
He wrenched away, and was gone. 

Great had succeeded in dodging 
the monster’s first rush. He stood 
now, panting, as the titanic thing 
whirled to come back at him. Less, 
instead of running toward the 
dome, was running toward him. 
And at that moment, the Lut broke 
into the open. 

He crossed the distance separat- 
ing himself from the monster like 
one long flash of glittering light. 
Reaching up with a forelimb as he 
passed he dealt it a blow that stag- 
gered it. For a second it stood 
dazed; then it raised its head and 
screamed. 

The Lut stood looking at it, from 
a few feet before it. His ice-green 
eyes caught the wild black ones of 
the creature and held them. 

“Go away,” said the Lut, very 
softly. 

He was reaching out with his 
own mind to the mind of the crea- 
ture, trying to impress it. 

“Go away,” repeated the Lut. “I 
do not want to hurt you.” 

The creature roared and shifted 

20 



uncertainly, feeling an uneasiness 
that it could not understand. For 
a moment it fought for decision — 
then it charged. 

The Lut shot from the ground 
like a projectile and met it head 
to head. There was a sound like 
a tree breaking in a high wind. The 
heavy bone Aat had warded off 
the missile from Great’s gun, gave 
like cardboard before the fantastic 
stuff of which the Lut’s body was 
constructed. The creature tumbled 
backwards, lay for a moment, then 
slowly struggled to its feet and 
reeled off like something half-con- 
scious. It’s huge forehead was 
caved in and dark fluid dripped 
from it and dropped on the ground 
as it went. 

“It will live,” said the Lut, look- 
ing after it. 

He turned to look at the bipeds. 
The Snorap had come up and 
Great, with Less shoved behind 
him, was frantically trying to un- 
jam the gun and shoot at them. 

“Put that thing away,” said the 
Lut. “We’re friends.” 

The man froze, his hands on the 
breech of his weapon. The Lut was 
forming the human words by swal- 
lowing air and forcing it back 
through his capable throat muscles; 
and the result was a deep, growl- 
ing bass that did not at first iden- 
tify itself with rational speech. 

“I said we’re friends,” said the 
Lut. “We’ve been watching you for 
a year now. Besides, your weapon 
there can’t hurt us.” He turned to 
the Snorap. “Say something to re- 
assure them that you’re not a wild 
animal.” 

“I have been guilty of badly mis- 
judging you,” said the Snorap 
humbly to the humans. He was 

GORDON DICKSON 




talking by the same process and 
the humans looked from him to the 
Lut as if they suspected the latter 
of being a ventriloquist. 

“Who — who are you?” asked 
Great at last. 

“We,” said the Lut, “are indi- 
vidual members of two old and 
respected races, from elsewhere 
than this system. You might refer 
to me as a Lut and to my friend as 
a Snorap. And you call yourselves 
?» 

The man laughed a little wildly. 
Exchanging introductions with two 
nightmare beings after a hair- 
breadth escape from death, has a 
tendency to make anyone a bit 
hysterical. 

“We’re humans,” he said. “I’m 
Jos Pamer. This is my wife, Gela.” 

“Wife?” said the Lut. 

“Why yes,” said Jos. “My wife.” 

“What is a wife?” asked the Lut. 

“Why — a wife — ” answered the 
human in astonishment. “I’m a 
man, she’s a woman. Male — ^female 

“You mean,” demanded the Lut, 
“that your race is bisexual?” 

“Of course,” answered the man. 



“Isn’t everything? Aren’t you — ** 
He broke off and stared at them. 
“You mean it’s not usual?” 

The Lut turned his head slowly 
and looked at the Snorap, who sat 
down in the dust. 

“I am an old fool,” said the 
Snorap, penitently, “I am a senile 
old idiot who ought to have my 
brains examined. Sitting here en- 
gaged in high speculation about the 
source of their racial philosophy 
and questioning their moral basis, 
when all the time they were loving 
each other and complementing each 
other’s character-traits right un- 
der my very nose. What else would 
be the basis of colonization in a 
bisexual race but the family unit? 
Where but in the urge to build a 
home would their drive lie? What 
would be their courage, but love 
transformed?” He sat with head 
hanging. “I am an old fool.” 

The Lut crossed over to him and 
hung his heavy head on the Sno- 
rap’ s shoulder. 

“Friend of many years past and 
yet to come,” he said. “We are 
old fools together.” •••

No one took Old Arch seriously; he was just an ancient, broken- 
down wanderer who went about seeking alms and spreading 
tales of the great Outside. But sometimes children are curious 
and believing when adults are cynical and doubting .

BY DAVE DRYFOOS 



T here have always been the 
touched, the blesses, Ck>d’s 
poor. Such a one was Old Arch. 
Archer Jakes, the Wanderer of the 
Plains. 

They say he was born on Earth 
in 3042 and taken to Mazzeppa as 
a child. That he learned pilotage 
and mining. But that he was in- 
jured in a cave-in on Hurretni in 
3068 or thereabouts, and then his 
wife died in a landing accident and 
his child was taken from him and 
adopted by people he never could 
find. 

Those things are too far distant in 



time and space to be verified now. 
But it is a fact that by 4000, when 
my grandfather Hockington Ham- 
mer was growing up in New Osh- 
kosh, Old Arch was a familiar fig- 
ure in all the Domed Cities of the 
Plains. 

He looked ancient then, with his 
deformed back that people touched 
for luck, and his wild hair and 
beard, and ragged castoff clothing. 
On his back he carried a roll of 
cloth he called his bed, though it 
looked like no bed any City man 
had ever seen. In his right hand he 
carried a staff of wood, unless some- 



22 





one bought it from him and gave all and why the guards? There’s no 
him a plastic rod in its place. And pollution. Am I not alive?” 
in his left he carried what he called The guards would touch his 
a billy can, which was a food con- hump and make circular motions 
tainer with a loop of wire across at the sides of their heads and raise 
the top for a handle, and the bottom their eyebrows as if to say, “Yes, 
blackened by what he said was fire, you’re alive. But are you not crazy?” 
It would have been like no fire Still they would admit him, the 
any City man had ever seen. Even only nonresident to walk between 
the water in the can would be poi- the Domed Cities of the Plains and 
son to a City man. When he came enter all of them; the only man to

make him throw it away. of the Outsiders who lived in the 

“Why the lock?” he’d demand, open on the Plains at the heart of 
coming into a City. “Why the lock the North American Continent of 
and why the plastic bubble over Earth. 

23 





And Old Arch would go to the 
residence buildings and he’d knock 
on someone’s door — any door, 
chosen at random — and he’d say, 
“Have you seen the sky and do you 
know it’s blue? Have you felt the 
soft kiss of the breezes? I can show 
you where to breathe fresh air.” 

Maybe the people would say, 
“Phew! Does it smell like you, this 
fresh air?” and slam the door in his 
face. 

Or maybe they’d say, “Come on 
around to the back, Old Man, and 
we’ll find you something to eat.” 

Then Old Arch would shoulder 
his bed and pick up his billy can 
and his staff and walk down the 
stairs and go around to the back 
and walk up the stairs to the rear 
door. 

It might be an hour before he 
appeared there — it might be two. 
When he did, the people would 
ask, “Why didn’t you say some- 
thing? You should have known 
they wouldn’t let you in the eleva- 
tor! And twenty flights down and 
twenty flights up again is too much 
for a man of your years.” 

Then, the next time he came 
they would do the same thing 
again. 

In the kitchen he would refuse 
all the pills and potions and shots, 
and insist on bulky foods. These he 
would eat neatly, holding aside the 
long white hair around his mouth 
and brushing the crumbs from it 
often. What he couldn’t eat right 
away would go into his blackened 
billy can. 

The children would come before 
he finished — those of the household, 
and neighbor kids too. First they’d 
stand shyly and watch him from a 
doorway. Then they’d press closer. 

24 



By the time he got through they’d 
be fighting to sit on his lap. 

The winner would climb up and 
sit there proudly. One of the losers, 
trying to prove he hadn’t lost much, 
might wrinkle up his nose and say, 
“What’s that awful stink. Old 
Man?” 

And Arch would answer mildly, 
“It’s only wood smoke, son.” 

Then the children would ask, 
“What’s wood, please? And what’s 
smoke?” 

And he would tell them. 

He would tell of the wind and the 
rain and the snow; of the cattalo 
herds that roamed to the west and 
the cities that lay to the east and 
the stars and the Moon that they 
never had seen. He would claim to 
have been in the endless forests and 
on the treeless plains and to have 
tasted the salt ocean and drunk of 
the freshwater lakes and rivers. 

The children would have heard, 
in their lessons and from their el- 
ders, enough to know what he was 
talking about. Sometimes they 
would tire of it, and ask him to tell 
of the distant planets and their far- 
off suns. But this he would not do. 

“You already hear too much 
about them,” he’d say. “I want you 
to know Earth. Your own country. 
The one planet on which these 
plastic-covered cities are unneces- 
sary, where you can actually go out 
and roll on the grass.” 

Then the children might ask, 
“What’s grass?” 

But their fathers would pointedly 
say, “What about the radioactivity. 
Old Man?” 

“I’m alive,” he’d reply. “There’s 
no radioactivity out there.” 

But they’d say, “How can we be 
sure? There are individual differ- 



DAVE DRYFOOS 




ences of susceptibility. Probably you 
are unhurt by dosages that would 
kill any normal person.” 

And the mothers would say, “Eat 
some more, Old Man. Eat — and 
go. Bring our babies dreams, if you 
like, but don’t try to tempt them 
Outside. Even if it isn’t radioactive 
there, you’ve admitted it gets hot 
and it gets cold and the wind blows 
fiercely hard. Our babies were bom 
under shelter, and under shelter 
they must stay, like us and our 
parents before us.” 

So Old Arch would brush off his 
whiskers one last time and maybe 
put on an old shirt the father dug 
up for him and then go out the 
back way. In spite of what might 
have been said, he would have to 
walk the twenty flights down to the 
ground because he wouldn’t be in- 
vited to walk through the apart- 
ment to the front hall where the 
elevator was. 

Sometimes people were hostile 
when he spoke to their children, 
and they would have him arrested. 
He was then bathed and barbered 
in the jail, and was given all new 
clothes. But they’d always burn his 
bed, and he’d have trouble getting 
a new one. And sometimes a jailor 
might covet the pocketknife he car- 
ried, or take away his billy can. On 
the whole I think he preferred not 
to go to jail except perhaps in win- 
ter, when it was cold outside the 
City. 

There were always those ready 
to talk of asylums, and the need to 
put him away for his own good. But 
nobody was sure where his legal 
residence was, so he wasn’t really 
eligible for public hospitalization. 

He kept to his rounds. My grand- 
father remembers standing in his 

SELLER OF THE SKY 



mother’s kitchen listening to Old 
Arch. It was like meeting one of 
Joseph’s brethren and being told 
exactly what the coat looked like. 
Something exciting out of a dream 
from the remote past, when all the 
worlds had on them those bright 
moist diamonds Arch described as 
morning dew. 

My grandfather wanted to see 
the morning dew, though he knew 
better than to say so. 

Old Arch understood. He tried 
to make the thing possible. But an 
opportunity to see the morning dew 
was something he just couldn’t give 
to my grandfather or anybody else. 

So he decided to sell it. 

He persuaded a charitable lithog- 
rapher to make him a batch of 
stock certificates. They looked very 
authentic. Each said plainly it was 
good for one share of blue sky, 
though the fat half-draped woman 
portrayed in three colors stood out- 
side a Domed City pointing not 
at the sky but at a distant river with 
forested hills behind it. 

Arch sold his certificates for a 
stiff price; ten dollars apiece. He 
could do it because by this time his 
wanderings followed a fairly 
definite route. The people who 
hated or feared or despised him 
were pretty well eliminated from 
it, and most of his calls were at 
apartments where he was known 
and expected and even respected a 
little. 

My grandfather’s was one of 
these — or rather, my great-grand- 
father’s. When Arch first brought 
his stock certificates my grandfa- 
ther was a little fellow everybody 
called Ham, maybe seven years old. 
He had a sister named Annie who 
was five. He’s given me a mental 

25 




picture of the two of them stand- 
ing close together for reassurance, 
and from an open doorway shyly 
watching the old man eat and lis- 
tening to him talk. 

When my great-grandfather 
bought a ten dollar stock certificate 
in my grandfather’s name, my 
grandfather took it as a promise. 
And his little sister Annie was so 
jealous that the next time Old 
Arch came around my great-grand- 
father had to buy a share for her. 

A S THEY grew to be nine, ten, 
eleven, twelve, every winter 
when Old Arch would come 
around, my grandfather and his 
sister Annie would ask, “When are 
you going to take us to see the sky. 
Arch?” And he would say, “When 
you’re older. When your folks say 
you can go.” And, “When it’s sum- 
mer, and not too cold for these old 
bones.” 

But when my grandfather was 
fourteen he followed Old Arch out 
and down the stairs after the old 
man had paid his annual call, and 
he stopped him on a landing to ask, 
“Arch, have you ever taken anyone 
Outside?” 

“No,” Arch said, sighing. “Peo- 
ple won’t go.” 

“I’ll go,” said my grandfather, 
“and so will my sister Annie.” 
Arch looked at him and put a 
hand on him and said, “I don’t 
want to come between any boy and 
his parents.” 

“Well,” said my grandfather, 
“you sold them a share of sky for 
each of us. Do you really want us 
to have that, or do you just want 
to talk about it?” 

“Of course I want you to. But I 



can’t take you Outside, boy.” 

My grandfather was disgusted. 
“There isn’t any sky,” he said sadly. 
“It’s all talk. The certificates were 
just for begging.” 

“No,” said Arch. “It’s not all talk 
and I’m not a beggar. I’m a guide. 
But it’s hard to see the sky right 
now because it’s winter, and there 
are clouds all over.” 

“Let’s see the clouds, then,” my 
grandfather said stubbornly. “I’ve 
never seen a cloud.” 

The old man sat down on the 
stairs to consider the matter. 

“I can’t do this thing to your 
parents,” he said at last. 

“But you can do it to me and my 
sister,” my grandfather charged 
wildly. “You can come to the house 
year after year after year, and tell 
us about the sky and the wind and 
the moon and the dew and the grass 
and the sun. You can even take 
money for our share of them. But 
when it comes time to produce — 
when we’re old enough to go where 
these things are supposed to be — 
you think of excuses. 

“I don’t believe there are any 
such things,” he shouted. “I think 
you’re a liar. I think you ought to 
be arrested for gypping my dad on 
the stock deal, and I’m going to 
turn you in.” 

“Don’t do that, boy,” Arch said 
mildly. 

“Then take us Outside — today!” 
“It’s winter, my boy. We’d 
freeze.” 

“You’ve said it’s pretty in winter! 
You took the money for the certifi- 
cate.” 

“I suppose you’ll grow away 
from your parents soon anyhow; I 
suppose you have to . Get your 
warmest clothes and meet me at

emergency exit four.” 

My grandfather talked it over 
with his sister Annie and of course 
they didn’t have any warm clothes, 
but they’d heard so often from Old 
Arch about the cold that they put 
on two sets of tights apiece, and two 
pairs of sox, and then they hunted 
for the emergency exit. 

They’d never been there before. 
They didn’t know anyone who had. 
The signs pointing to it were all 
worn and defaced. 

And it was a long way to go. 
After a while Annie began to hang 
back. 

“How do we know the exit will 
work?” she asked. “And how will 
we get back in if we ever do get 
out?” 

“You don’t have to come,” my 
grandfather said. “But you’ll have 
to find your own way home from 
here.” 

“I’ll bet I could,” she said. “But 
I’m not going to. I don’t think 
Old Arch will even be at the exit.” 

But he was. 

He looked at them carefully to see 
how they were dressed. “You mean 
trouble for me, girl,” he told Annie. 
“They’ll think I took you along to 
make love to.” 

She had just reached that betwixt 
and between stage where she was 
beginning to look like a woman but 
didn’t yet think like one. “Pooh!” 
she said. “I can run faster and hit 
harder than you can. Arch. You 
don’t worry me a bit.” 

Old Arch sighed and led them 
through the lock. They stepped out 
into a raging snowstorm, which 
soon draped a cloak of invisibility 
over them. 

Neither my grandfather nor An- 
nie had ever smelled fresh air be- 

SELLER OF THE SKY 



fore. It threatened to make them 
drunk. Their nostrils tingled and 
their eyes misted over and their 
breath steamed up like bathwater. 
For the first time in their lives, they 
shivered. 

When the City was out of sight 
in the storm, they stopped for a 
moment in the ankle-deep snow 
and just listened. They held their 
breaths and heard silence for the 
first time in their lives. 

Old Arch reached down and 
picked up some soft snow and threw 
it at them. They pelted him back, 
and then, because he was so old, 
attacked each other instead, shout- 
ing and throwing snowballs and 
running aimlessly. 

Old Arch soon checked them. 
“Don’t get lost,” he said. “We’re 
walking down hill. Don’t forget 
that. We’re going into a draw where 
there are some trees.” 

He coughed and drew his rags 
about him. “The city is up hill,” 
he said. “If you keep walking 
around it you’ll find a way in.” 

His tone was frightening. Annie 
clung to my grandfather and made 
him walk close to the old man. It 
was clear the old man didn’t have 
enough clothes on. He staggered 
and leaned hard on my grandfa- 
ther. 

They kept moving down the 
slight grade. They saw no sky and 
little of anything else. The snow 
was like a miniature of the City’s 
Dome, except that this dome floated 
over them as they walked. Its edges 
were only about fifty yards off. 

“Where are the Outsiders?” my 
grandfather asked. “Aren’t there 
people here?” 

“They’re miles away,” Arch told 
him. “And indoors. Only fools and 

27 




youngsters are out in this blizzard.” 

“Fools is right,” Annie said tartly. 
“There was supposed to be sky. 
And there isn’t.” 

Old Arch staggered again. To my 
grandfather he said, “Could — could 
you carry my pack?” 

My grandfather took it and they 
went on, stumbling blindly through 
knee-deep drifts, getting more and 
more chilled and less and less com- 
fortable, ’til they came to a small 
clump of trees with a solidly frozen 
creek running through it. 

Here Old Arch made a lean-to 
shelter of windf alien limbs. Annie 
and my grandfather helped as soon 
as they understood the design. Arch 
spread part of his bed over the 
lean-to, breaking the force of the 
wind, and put ihe rest inside. Just 
outside, on a place scraped bare of 
snow, he built the first wood fire my 
grandfather and Annie had ever 
seen. 

He chipped ice from the creek 
and put it in his billy can and 
hung the can by its bail over the 
fire, and in due course they had 
a little hot tea. 

The youngsters felt cold but 
happy. The old man shivered and 
coughed. 

He’d kept moving till the tea 
was made. He sat still to drink it, 
and couldn’t get up. 

“Go to bed,” Annie told him. 
“Ham will get on one side of you 
and I’ll get on the other. We’ll keep 
you warm.” 

Old Arch tried to protest but 
was almost beyond speech. The 
youngsters didn’t know enough to 
iDrush the snow off him or them- 
selves. They helped him roll up in 
his bedding and crawled under the 
lean-to after him. There they all lay 

28 



in a heap, getting colder and damp- 
er and more miserable, till finally 
my grandfather couldn’t stand it 
any more. 

He got up and looked around. 
The inverted cup of visibility was 
smaller. Darkness fell like a dye- 
stuff, turning the white snow to 
gray, to black. 

It was a bitter night. The first 
he’d ever had outdoors. It was 
the first Annie’d ever had. The first 
either had ever spent at the futile 
task of holding off death. 

They knew Old Arch was dying. 
As the night wore on he sank into 
semi-consciousness. They hugged 
him and rubbed his lean old limbs. 

Just before morning the snow 
stopped. The old man roused a lit- 
tle, became gradually aware of his 
surroundings. 

“Go look at the sun,” he mur- 
mured. “Go see the sunrise.” 

They went out to look. Neither 
had ever seen a sunrise before. It 
was mauve first, then red, then 
gold, then blue. Venus led the way, 
and the sun followed. The moon, 
deep in the west, was like a tomb- 
stone to the dead night. 

A bird chirruped. A clot of snow 
fell from a tree with a soft rufile of 
cottony drums. 

My grandfather held his sister’s 
hand and looked and sniffed at the 
great Earth from which he’d been 
separated by the fear-inspired plas- 
tic over his City, so near, now, in 
the clear morning night. He climbed 
with Annie up the side of the draw 
and looked out over snow-covered 
plains stretching to a horizon far- 
ther away than the longest distance 
he’d ever imagined. 

He went back and took Old 
Arch’s head up on his knees and 

DAVE DRYFOOS 




said, “Is it like this every day?” 
And the old man said, “No, each 
day is different.” 

And my grandfather said, “Well, 
IVe seen one, anyhow.” 

“That’s what I’ve lived for,” said 
Old Arch. And he smiled and 
stopped living. 

Annie and my grandfather left 
him there and went back to the 
City and told the guards and their 
family. A burial party was sent out; 
guards, in their helmeted space- 
suits. 

People heard about it and fol- 



lowed. Everyone was curious be- 
cause they’d all seen Old Arch and 
wondered about him. 

Hundreds of people went out the 
gate — so many, the guards couldn’t 
stop them. They saw the lean-to 
and the open fire and the woods 
and the snow and the frozen creek. 
They smelled the air and the smoke. 
They heard a bird. They tossed 
snowballs. 

And then they went back and 
flung rocks through their City’s 
Dome. • • • 



WORTH CITING 

TWO UNITED STATES icebreakers recently crushed their 
way through Arctic ice to find the fabled Northwest Passage, 
long a lure to adventurers and explorers. The two ships success- 
fully plowed their way through ice that was often four to ten 
feet thick to find the water route which links the Atlantic Ocean 
with the Pacific Ocean across the top of the world. One ship 
crushed and blasted its way through McClure Strait, while the 
other fought its way through from the Arctic Ocean, skirting 
along its southern edge. 

The Burton Island and the Northwind were both U.S. ships, 
but they were part of a joint United States-Canadian expedition 
conducting oceanographic and hydrographic studies in that area. 
The studies are part of a continuing research program to make 
the frozen wastes of the vast Arctic more accessible for military 
operations, and strengthening one of the most vital links in our 
combined continental defenses. 

Helicopters and naval specialists in underwater demolition, 
known as “frogmen”, were invaluable contributions of both 
nations. The helicopters spotted new routes through the ice, and 
the “frogmen” helped to check the depth of ice fields, tested 
various explosives for blasting through them, and tried out un- 
derwater cameras designed for use in Arctic waters. 

Our citation this month goes to the governments of the United 
States and Canada, and to the men of the expedition, for this 
international defense venture in which they combined manpower, 
techniques, knowledge and equipment — with daring, courage 
and common spirit — to explore and strengthen this strategic 
Arctic area.

sparkled with red jewels. She stood 
in the middle of the room, head 
tilted back, eyes closed, moving in 
time to the music coming from an 
invisible transmitter. Her hands 
glided sinuously up and down either 



side of her body. She seemed obliv- 
ious to the people circling the 
room enjoying Gil Patton’s party. 
It was only when she heard Brant’s 
voice that she opened her eyes. 

“Lisa, you go for that stuff, I 
see,” Brant called to her, referring 
to the music being piped into the 
room from one of Dream town’s 
many Sensory Communications 
Centers.

“It’s really out of this world, 
Brant, way out, all out!” Lisa re- 
plied. She came over and sat on 
the arm of the chair in which Brant 
sprawled. 

“You can feel it way down here,” 
she said, and placed her hand on 
the pit of her stomach. 

“Wonder how we ever got kicks 
out of that old stuff* that you 
couldn’t feel?” Brant asked as he 
placed his arm about Lisa’s waist. 
“Just hearing music doesn’t give 
you any glow.” 

Brant slid farther down in the 
chair and stretched his legs out be- 
fore him. The bluish light in the 
room glinted from the highly pol- 
ished surface of his knee length 
boots. He wore loose-fitting yellow 
trousers and a black suede shirt 
split open almost to the waist, re- 
vealing his chest. 

“Have you tried one of Gil’s new 
pebbles?” he asked Lisa. 

“No, what’s new about them?” 
she asked. She wriggled into Brant’s 
lap and rubbed her cheek against 
his chest. 

“They’re slaughter. Instead of 
just getting a deeper feeling from 
real experiences, you can sit back 
and imagine something — anything 
— and you can feel the sensations 
of your fantasy. You can feel all 
that way down here, too,” he said, 
touching, in repetition of Lisa’s 
gesture, the pit of her stomach. 

“Get me one, Brant. Let’s see 
what goes.” 

Brant lifted Lisa to her feet and 
rose from the chair. His boots 
clicked against the green metal 
floor as he pushed his way through 
the crowd of merry makers toward 
a transparent glass bubble which 
was suspended from the ceiling by

a silver chain. He pushed back the 
dispenser on the bubble and a 
cylindrical pill rolled out onto his 
hand. He carried it back to where 



31 




Lisa sat swaying to the music which 
continued to fill the room. 

“Here child. This will really give 
you a dream/’ he said as he handed 
her the pill. 

Brant watched Lisa sink into the 
half coma that the senation pills 
produced. He leaned over and 
kissed her shoulder. Then he 
straightened and moved across the 
room to where Gill Patton stood in 
front of a glass wall which afforded 
a panoramic view of the entire city. 

“Good party, Gil,” Brant said 
to his host. 

“I hoped it wouldn’t be sad. Any- 
thing clicking?” 

Brant pointed to Lisa. “She is. 
Been trying your new pebbles.” 

“How’s the Assistant Director of 
Sensory Communications doing 
these days?” Gil asked as they 
walked across the room to a plastic 
table on which rested bowls of red, 
green, and yellow liquors. 

“Right and light. W’eve got a 
new show scheduled to go on the 
Distributor Cable in about another 
month. Runs twenty minutes two 
times a day. Morning and night. A 
serial about the Council.” 

Gil turned to Brant with a drink 
in his hand. “Thought nobody 
knew anything about the Council 
except that they run Dreamtown.” 

“No one does know very much 
about them. No one’s ever seen 
them actually. But we’ve heard 
rumors that the Rebels have been 
influencing some of our citizens and 
word has come down to build this 
show for morale purposes.” 



“Why, that’s crazy. Who’d want 
to go back to the way it was before? 
Those Rebels are out of their 
heads!” 

Brant smiled. “Right man. But 
there are still some of them oper- 
ating in the less populated areas. 
The Watchers brought in seven men 
and a woman last week from some- 
where south of here. They found 
books in their hideout and even 
some paintings that one of the Reb- 
els claimed to have done by hand.” 

Gil whistled through his teeth. 
“You’d think they’d get with it and 
come back here. What are they 
getting out of this rebellion?” 

Brant reached over and touched 
Gil’s arm. 

“Just between us, friend. Before 
they psychwashed these Rebels they 
found out that they had been plot- 
ting with other Rebel groups to 
overthrow Dreamtown. The Coun- 
cil has every available Watcher on 
their trail.” 

“Couldn’t ever happen, Brant. 
They don’t have anything to fight 
with. Books. Pictures. They’ll wise 
up and come over to us. Wait and 
see.” 

Brant shrugged. “They forget 
we’re living in 2054 and the Big 
War’s been over for nearly seventy 
years. They still think the old way 
was pretty good. But Gil, boy, we’re 
getting serious. Let’s stack it! The 
Watcher’s will get them. It’s not 
our problem.” 

The girl was gazing through one 
of the windows in the small farm-

Contest was made in the November issue. The stories winning the first 
and second prizes appeared in the December and January issues.

house kitchen. A wild flower was 
pinned in her long, auburn hair 
and it matched, almost perfectly, 
the blue of her eyes. Even in slacks 
she was, not beautiful, but a won- 
derfully pretty girl of twenty four 
or five. 

“I wonder when he’ll be back. 
Dad. It’s been almost two days and 
I — I’m worried.” 

“He had a long trip to make, 
Nancy. Longer than usual because 
he had to make a detour around 
Dreamtown in order to get down 
to Ben’s group. It’s all of forty 
miles south of here. Don’t you 
worry. He’ll be back soon.” 

The girl came away from the 
window and kissed Professor Alan 
Corbett on the forehead. “You’re 
wonderful. Dad. So calm and sen- 
sible about things. I get scared 
though when I think of Dan going 
so close to Dreamtown. The Watch- 
ers patrol for miles around the city 
and they’d know Dan was a Rebel 
in a minute because of his clothes.” 

“Dan won’t get caught, Nancy. 
You get busy now and make some 
coffee and stop worrying,” Profes- 
sor Corbett smiled. “And afterward 
we’ll play a little gin rummy if you 
feel like it.” 

Nancy got up from the table and 
put the coffee pot on the stove. Her 
father turned back to the book ly- 
ing open on the table before him. 

“This is such a treasure, Nancy. 
I wonder if you fully realize it.” It 
was a copy of the complete works of 
William Shakespeare. “There are 
only five copies of this still in exis- 
tence to my knowledge; although 
there is a man in Ben’s group who 
has been copying it by hand on 
paper the’ve stolen from Dream- 
town. Only five copies. There might 

dreamtown, U.S.A 



be more, but we haven’t been able 
to find them.” 

Nancy poured steaming coffee 
into her father’s cup and then into 
her own. She sat across from him 
at the table and watched as he 
lovingly examined the book in his 
hands. 

“Listen to this, Nancy.” 

Nancy listened to Professor Cor- 
bett’s quiet voice. 

“Is she kind as she is fair? 

For Beauty lives with kindness. 

Love doth to her eyes repair 

To help him of his blindness. 

And, being helped, inhabits 
there.” 

“It’s beautiful. Dad. 

Nancy watched her father as his 
eyes scanned the rest of the page. 
“You love books, don’t you?” she 
asked softly. 

Her father looked up and took 
off his glasses. “Yes, Nancy, I guess 
I do. Teaching in the University 
was the greatest thing in my life 
because I was able to spend so much 
time with books. And, you know, in 
a way, they weren’t just books, they 
were like old friends. Socrates, Aris- 
totle, Chaucer, Shakespeare — all 
the others. Every time I picked up 
one of those books it was like meet- 
ing old friends. And you never 
really get tired of old friends, you 
know. As the years go by they be- 
come dearer to you and you learn 
to appreciate their true value.” 
Professor Corbett smiled a little 
sadly. “Nancy, it almost broke my 
heart when the Council abolished 
the schools and colleges and burned 
the books. That was the reason I 
joined the Rebels ever so long 
ago. And, of course, there were 

33 




many others who felt as I did.” 

Nancy sipped the hot coffee and 
watched her father drift into his 
reverie about the old days before 
there had been a Council or Watch- 
ers and when Dreamtown had 
really been just what the name im- 
plied. A dream city of books and 
learning and hard working men 
and women trying to put a civiliz- 
ation back on its feet after the dis- 
astrous Big War. Nancy thought of 
the kind of dreams that were 
dreamed in the city now. Dreams 
of pleasure and sensation. Empty 
dreams. Vapid dreams. 

“Do you know what the Council 
set up in place of the schools, 
Nancy? They built the biggest and 
brightest and most terrible play- 
grounds in the world. Children 
were taught to fight and to play; 
and the ones who fought hardest, 
regardless of rules, were considered 
the champions in each playground. 
They didn’t bother to learn any- 
thing; they just played . •” His 
voice trailed off. 

Nancy and her father drank their 
coffee in silence, each of them alone 
with their thoughts. Professor Cor- 
bett was back in his University 
classroom filled with the smell of 
chalk and the musty odor of books, 
and Nancy was out in the dark night 
somewhere with Dan, making the 
perilous journey to Ben’s Rebel 
group. 

A sudden sound on the porch 
shocked both of them back to 
reality. Professor Corbett quickly 
dropped his book into a drawer of 
the table, rose and walked past 
Nancy who stared at the door with 
a mixture of hope and fear on her 
face. A soft knock sounded and, 
after a moment’s hesitation, Nan- 

34 



cy’s father unbolted and opened 
the door. 

A tall young man wearing an old 
pair of blue jeans and a shirt from 
which most of the buttons were 
missing stood in the doorway. 

“Dan!” Nancy shouted and ran 
across the room and into his arms. 

His huge frame almost filled the 
doorway, as he bowed, his blonde 
head to murmur reassurances to 
Nancy, who cried with relief at 
having him safely back. 

“I’m alright, darling, — but I’m 
afraid I’ve got bad news,” Dan said. 
He released Nancy, keeping one of 
her hands in his. When the three 
of them were seated Dan spoke. 

“The Watchers must have gotten 
Ben and the others. The place was 
a shambles. Everything was de- 
stroyed. They probably took the 
group to Dreamtown. If they did, 
you know what that means.” 

“Psychwashing,” Professor Cor- 
bett muttered. He dropped his head 
in his hands. “Then you couldn’t 
get the books?” he asked sadly. 

“No. They had been burned. 
And so had Ben’s paintings. We 
can’t wait any longer, Alan. We’ve 
got to organize and we’ve got to 
raid Dreamtown. We can’t go on 
like this anymore!” 

Nancy tightened her grip on 
Dan’s hand as Professor Corbett 
raised his head and nodded. 
“You’re right, Dan,” he said. “We 
can’t afford to wait any longer.” 



W ITH A slight hum the large 
video panel in the ceiling of 
Brant’s apartment clicked on auto- 
matically. To the accompaniment 
of shrill laughter in the background, 
the annoimcer told Brant and the 



LEO P. KELLEY 




other viewers that they were about 
to witness the next installment in 
the adventures of “The Pretty Peo- 
ple.” Brant stretched in his bed and 
groaned from the effects of the 
party the night before. He watched 
through half closed eyes as The 
Pretty People in their harlequin 
costumes chased each other about 
a meadow filled with artificial flow- 
ers. In spite of his discomfort Brant 
chuckled when Mannequina, with 
a violent blow, knocked Manequin 
from a large toadstool on which 
he had been seated. He laughed 
again as he watched Manequin 
roll down a hill and land in a giant 
mud puddle at the bottom. 

Brant eased himself out of bed 
and walked unsteadily to the cu- 
bicle in one comer of the room, 
stepped in, and closed the plastic 
door behind him. He rubbed his 
eyes and stretched as the soothing 
vigoro-senso rays removed the last 
traces of the discomfort brought 
on by too much liquor and too 
many sensation pills. 

Back in his room he switched on 
the dimensional theater set and 
watched the wall light up before 
him. Brant finished dressing to the 
sounds of laughter coming from 
The Pretty People on the ceiling 
video and the sighs and pleadings of 
two lovers in the dimensional 
theater set. 

On his way to the door Brant 
selected one of the milder sensa- 
tion pills from the bowl on the 
low table, swallowed it, and passed 
through the sliding door panel into 
the street. 

He glanced at the gigantic clock 
which was suspended over the city 
like a cloud in the sky by thin steel 
cables. Each numeral on the huge 

DREAMTOWN, U.S.A. 



face of the clock was composed of 
a man and a woman locked in an 
ardent embrace. 

Brant and several other people 
boarded one of the moving plat- 
forms as it stopped before them. 
The city sped by in a vari-colored 
blur. At die main Sensory Corn- 
munications Building Brant got off. 
The building loomed massive be- 
fore him, its rose plastic exterior 
warm looking in the sunlight. Brant, 
with another glance skyward at the 
clock, went inside. 

He walked briskly down the jade 
hall and entered an office labeled 
Assistant Director of Sensory Com- 
munications. 

Lisa, seated behind a desk, 
greeted him. “We’ve got sun this 
morning, Brant. Have a good time 
last night?” 

“Had a ball, doll! You look great 
this morning.” Brant said. “Benton 
in yet?” 

“Waiting for you,” Lisa replied. 
“Told me to send you right in.” 

Brant turned and entered the 
inner office of Axel Benton, Di- 
rector of Sensory Communications 
for Dreamtown. 

Benton looked up and frowned as 
Brant entered. “The show on the 
Council has to go on two weeks 
earlier,” he fairly shouted at Brant. 
“The Minister of Entertainment 
called this morning and he’s hot! 
Says the Council is having a fit 
about the increase in activity among 
the Rebels; and rumors have been 
leaking out that they’re planning 
to destroy Dreamtown. So they 
want the show on sooner. Also, they 
want a half hour show instead 
of twenty minutes.” 

“Nobody cares what the Rebels 
are doing and it’s crazy to think 

35 




they could destroy the city. So 
what’s all the rush about?” Brant 
asked angrily. 

“I figured you’d talk that way so 
I arranged a little session for you 
this morning that may bring you to 
yoiu* senses, bright boy Brant,” 
Benton retorted. He barked into the 
intercom on the desk. 

“Call downstairs and have them 
send up Jennings, Lisa,” Benton 
ordered. 

A few minutes later the door 
slid open and Jennings was led in 
by two of the Watchers. He was a 
middle aged man who wore spec- 
tacles instead of the contact lenses 
which nearly everyone in Dream- 
town wore when they needed 
glasses. The two Watchers stepped 
aside. They were young men, 
neither looked more than twenty 
five, with eyes as brittle as glass. 
Their black leather pants and 
jackets fitted tightly and steel cleats 
on their heavy boots grated wick- 
edly on the floor with each step 
they took. Their hands, in black 
leather gloves, restly casually on 
their hips close to the hypno ray 
guns fastened to their belts. 

“Jennings,” Benton began, “was 
found to be in possession of a book 
titled ‘Principles of Human Knowl- 
edge’ by George Berkeley. And 
Jennings, as you know Brant, was 
in a strategic control position 
here in the Center. He was in 
charge of show censorship for the 
whole Com center. 

“What do you mean, was in 
charge?” Brant asked. 

“Just that! He is no longer in 
charge. In fact, he is being taken 
now by these Watchers to the psych 
lab but I wanted you to realize the 
seriousness of this thing, Brant, so 

36 



I had him brought here first.” 
“He’s going to be psychwashed?” 
Brant asked. 

“Of course, you fool!” 

“But why? Couldn’t you just 
burn the book and throw him out?” 
Brant asked. 

“I wouldn’t expect you to under- 
stand,” Benton sneered. “The book 
he had is one of the most danger- 
ous books ever written. It is 
against every principle on which 
Dreamtown is founded and if Lisa 
hadn’t found it in his office — .” 
“Lisa found it?” Brant asked. 
“Yes, and like the smart girl she 
is, she reported him to the Watch- 
ers right away.” Benton motioned 
to the two Watchers and they 
stiffened immediately, seized Jen- 
nings who stared silently before 
him, and half dragged him from 
the room. 

“I never would have thought it 
of Jennings,” Brant said softly. 

“That’s just it! We can’t be too 
careful,” Benton said. 

“Are you sure he was a Rebel?” 
Brant asked. 

Benton’s fist made a crashing 
sound as he brought it down on 
the desk. “Idiot!” he screamed. 
“What else could he be? No one 
but a Rebel would read such trash! 
Now get out of here, Brant. I want 
the format for the Council show 
finished in two days or you’re going 
to find yourself in real big trouble! 
Seeing Jennings should wake you 
up and start you moving!” 

Brant rose. “I see what you 
mean. You’ll have the format.” 
“Good! We’re bringing out a new 
sensation pill in a few weeks and 
we’d like to coincide the opening of 
this show with the release of the 
pill. Big promotion and all that. 

LEO P. KELLEY 




And, by the way, don’t forget the 
show schedule for the annual Play- 
ground Festival.” 

Benton turned back to the work 
on his desk as Brant left the office. 



M en and women were crowded 
into the smoke filled living 
room of Professor Corbett’s farm- 
house, and conversations were be- 
ing carried on in hushed whispers. 
Nancy stood talking to Dan. Pro- 
fessor Corbett was near them busi- 
ly engaged in conversation with 
two women and a man whose 
clothes looked as if they had seen 
many years of hard wear. 

Dan left Nancy and walked to 
the center of the room. His voice 
rang out vibrant and clear as he 
called for the attention of the 
gathered crowd. 

“I believe we are all here now. 
If everyone will sit down we’ll be- 
gin the meeting.” 

When everyone was seated Dan 
nodded to Professor Corbett. 

“You all know by now,” Profes- 
sor Corbett began, “that Ben’s 
group was discovered and probably 
destroyed. We’ve been able to find 
no trace of them. Things have 
been going pretty badly for us, 
friends, and that is why we asked 
you all to make the effort to come 
here tonight. For many of you it’s 
been hard ; you’ve come a long way. 
But we have to make a stand and 
we must make that stand together.” 
Applause greeted Professor Cor- 
bett’s introduction and, after hes- 
itating a moment, he continued. 

“It is likely that Ben and the 
others were taken to Dreamtown 
and psychwashed. In the past few 
days we have received no word 

dreamtown, U.S.A 



from Jennings either. It is possible 
that he has been found out and is 
vmable to contact us. At any rate, 
we must operate on that assump- 
tion until we hear from him 
again. — If we do,” he added sol- 
emnly. 

Every eye in the group was fixed 
on Professor Corbett and every ear 
strained to hear each word he spoke. 

“The Watchers have been pa- 
trolling an increasingly wider area 
around Dreamtown, which necessi- 
tates moving our outposts farther 
away. This will make communi- 
cations between our groups more 
difficult, but it is a necessary 
maneuver. Another thing. Take 
your books and music and paint- 
ings and anything else which might 
give you away, and hide them in 
some safe place. It is most impor- 
tant that we preserve what we have 
left. It must not fall into the hands 
of the Watchers.” 

A woman in the group spoke. 
“We can’t just keep running and 
hiding! We should do something!” 

“That is exactly the reason I 
asked you here tonight,” Professor 
Corbett replied. “Dan and I have 
formulated a plan and we submit 
it to you for your consideration, 
approval, and cooperation. Dan, 
will you explain what we have 
worked out?” 

Dan rose and came to stand be- 
side the Professor. 

“First of all,” he began, “we 
need four volunteers to go into 
Dreamtown, get jobs, and wait for 
the raid. These four people will 
have to be in strategic positions on 
the day we raid the city. Two of 
them will open the North gates of 
the city. One will dynamite the 
warehouses where the sensation 



37 




drugs are stored. And the fourth 
must in some way gain control of 
the Watcher’s barracks and arse- 
nal.” 

There was excitement on the 
faces of the people who listened to 
Dan’s words. They began to see a 
ray of hope and a course of action, 
and they leaned eagerly forward as 
Dan continued speaking. 

“Our first target when we raid 
the city, will be the Council Build- 
ing. If we can get control of the 
Council we have the heart of the 
city in our hands.” 

Two men stood up. “We want to 
volunteer to go to Dreamtown,” 
they said. A woman rose and joined 
them. “If you can use a woman, 
I’d like to go too.” Two other men 
volunteered, and there was much 
excited discussion in the small 
room. 

Dan held up his hands and asked 
for quiet. “Since four men have 
volunteered,” he said to the wom- 
an, “we’d best use them. And now, 
if those four men will stay here 
with me, the rest of you can leave. 
You will be notified of details by 
runner, as in the past.” 

The group broke up into smaller 
groups. Some went into the kitchen, 
where Nancy had prepared a lunch 
for them. Others prepared to leave 
for their own outposts. 

Professor Corbett was talking to 
an elderly man who had been a 
scientist in one of Dreamtown’s first 
laboratories. 

“It’s a copy of a research project 
done by a colleague of mine on the 
Relativity Theory. An astute paper, 
I’d say. I’ve been saving it for you,” 
Professor Corbett told the scientist. 
“I have it hidden with most of my 
other books up on the hillside by the 

38 



spring. Wait just a minute and I’ll 
get it for you.” 

“Never mind. Dad,” Nancy said. 
She had been passing and over- 
heard her father’s remark. “I’ll get 
it. You stay here and talk. I know 
you’re having more fun than you’ve 
had in months and I wouldn’t see 
you spoil it for the world.” 

“But — Professor Corbett tried 
to protest. 

“Hush, now. Be back in a jiffy,” 
Nancy said as she slipped out the 
door into the darkness outside. 

Professor Corbett and the scien- 
tist continued talking. Others joined 
them and the discussion became 
heated. It touched on science, art, 
literature, and many other topics 
that had been important and com- 
mon in the old days. A few min- 
utes passed and Dan joined the 
group. 

“Where’s Nancy, Alan?” he 
asked. 

Professor Corbett turned to Dan 
to explain Nancy’s errand when the 
sound of a shrill scream from some- 
where outside the house caused 
everyone to stiffen in fright. 

“It’s Nancy!” Dan shouted and 
sprang for the door. He wrenched 
it open and, as he did so, a burst of 
flame seared out of the blackness, 
missing him by inches. Another 
scream followed the first. 

The people in the room were 
galvanized into action. Professor 
Corbett ran to a chest in a comer of 
the room. He unlocked it quickly 
and handed a ray gun to Dan. He 
distributed guns to most of the 
other men. The guns had been 
smuggled out of Dreamtown by 
Jennings and others over a period 
of years. Soon men were stationed 
at every window of the house firing 

LEO P. KELLEY 




out into the blackness. 

“It’s the Watchers!” a woman 
shouted. 

“Be careful of your fire,” Dan 
yelled, “they’ve got Nancy!” 

The firing continued, while Pro- 
fessor Corbett and some of the 
others struggled to smother a fire 
that had been started by a blast 
from a Watcher’s ray gun. 

“I’m going out after them!” Dan 
shouted. 

Professor Corbett grabbed for 
Dan in an effort to stop him, but 
he was too late. The Professor left 
the others to battle the fire and 
raced after Dan. 

As he stumbled along in the dark- 
ness, he could barely discern Dan’s 
figure racing in the direction from 
which the shots had come. There 
was no firing now and the hillside 
was quiet. Dan had stopped, and 
Professor Corbett joined him in the 
darkness. Both men looked fran- 
tically in every direction. 

“There’s no trace of them. They 
got away, Alan. We held them off, 
but they’ve taken Nancy with 
them!” 

Professor Corbett put his arm 
around Dan’s shoulder. His eyes 
filled with tears and he gripped Dan 
tightly. For a few seconds neither 
of them spoke and then Professor 
Corbett turned to Dan. 

“We’d better go back to the 
house.” 

The two men turned and walked 
slowly back to the farmhouse where 
the others still battled the fire. 

Lisa and Brant walked down the 
street toward the Playground. 

“Benton liked your script for the 
Council show, Brant,” Lisa said 
as they walked along. 

DREAMTOWN, U.S.A. 



“It was a hard card to handle. 
I’ll tell you,” Brant said. “No one 
actually knows anything about the 
Council. We don’t even know how 
many members there are. It was 
hard trying to get enough informa- 
tion to fill the show time, so I just 
reworked the old stories about the 
Council and added a few new 
ones.” 

Lisa slipped her arm through 
Brant’s. “I’m proud of you, honey. 
It must have been good to set 
Benton hopping like that. What’d 
you put in it?” 

“Just said the Council was 
Dreamtown’s protector, provider 
and producer. Said the same thing 
twenty times in twenty different 
ways; but didn’t answer any of the 
real questions about the Council.” 

“No one asks any questions, 
Brant. Who cares how many men 
are on the Council or how they 
operate? So long as we have our 
flip food and parties — ^who cares? 
You worry too much.” 

Brant laughed and patted Lisa’s 
hand. “You’re right. Jennings wor- 
ried too much and look what hap- 
pened to him!” 

They continued down the street, 
standing aside once as a group of 
Watchers in semi-military forma- 
tion passed them. As they turned a 
corner they saw the solid red wall 
that surrounded the Playground ris- 
ing in the distance. 

“Will you be able to get the in- 
formation you want here, Brant?” 
Lisa asked. 

“If they let us in,” he replied. 

“I’ve never been in the Play- 
ground before, have you?” Lisa 
asked. 

“Once. A long time ago when 
it was first put into operation, but 



39 




they say things have changed a lot 
since then,” Brant replied. 

A watcher halted them as they 
approached the gate. Brant ex- 
plained about coming to gather 
material for the forthcoming Play- 
ground Festival show and displayed 
his official Sensory Communications 
card. The Watcher directed them to 
wait and stepped into a booth at 
one side of the gate. Brant and Lisa 
saw him talking to someone on the 
video phone. A moment later he 
returned, unlocked the gate, and 
motioned them inside. Once in, 
they were met by another Watcher 
who led them down a long hall to 
a door at the far end. The silence 
of the hall was in direct contrast to 
the cacophony that met their ears 
as they stepped through the door 
into the Playground. 

Children of both sexes and of 
every age and size filled the Play- 
ground. Nearly all were shouting at 
the tops of their voices. Scattered 
among the group were men and 
women dressed in the briefest of 
costumes. Some participated in the 
children’s games, but most stood 
and watched, in rather stony si- 
lence, the activity before them. 

From one of the small buildings 
within the Playground, a young 
man walked toward Lisa and 
Brant. The Watcher stepped aside 
as he approached. 

‘T am Kirk Rodson,” the man 
said to Brant and Lisa. “Director 
of the Playground. Can I help 
you?” 

Brant introduced himself and 
Lisa to the man, and explained 
their purpose in coming to the 
Playground. 

“I see,” Rodson said. “There’s 
not much to tell. Children are 

40 



brought here immediately after 
birth and are cared for in our 
laboratories. Their instruction in 
walking and talking is accelerated 
by specially trained personnel. As 
soon as an infant learns to walk he 
is released into the Playground with 
the others for a specified time each 
day. He is fed a specially prepared 
diet. As he grows older, he is left 
in the Playground for increasingly 
longer periods of time in order that 
he may adjust to its demands.” 

“When do the children leave 
here?” Brant asked. 

“The program of the Playground 
is arranged to accommodate chil- 
dren until they reach the age of 
eighteen,” Rodson answered curtly. 

“What generally becomes of the 
children then?” Lisa asked. 

“Most of them become ordinary 
citizens. The best of the male group 
are trained as Watchers. The fe- 
males usually join a breeder group. 
It is only the elect, with the highest 
qualifications, that can fill either of 
these positions.” 

“Who are those men and women 
out there with the children?” Brant 
asked, staring out into the crowded 
Playground. 

“They are some of the older ones 
who work with the children. Those 
young men are joining the Watchers 
when they finish here.” 

Brant, Lisa, and Rodson watched 
as one of the leaders called sharply 
to a curly headed boy who had been 
playing with a pretty raven haired 
girl. The boy leaped to his feet at 
the sound of his name and raced to 
where the athletic young man 
stood. The man pointed to a group 
of two boys and a girl who were 
engaged in a tussle on the ground 
before him.

Brant and Lisa repressed their 
surprise as the boy quickly leaped 
into the melee and, by virtue of his 
superior strength and size, beat the 
two boys and the girl until they 
fled before his brutal blows. The 
boy stared after them a moment 
and then returned to the man whose 
directions he had followed. Rodson 
laughed a short harsh laugh as the 
man slapped the boy’s face and sent 
him sprawling in the dust. 

“These children must learn to 
be constantly on guard. The strong- 
er the person, the better chance he 
has for survival,” Rodson explained. 

“It’s a rather hard way to learn, 
isn’t it?” Lisa asked. 

Rodson stared icily at her for a 
moment before he answered. “Les- 
sons learned the hard way are long- 
est remembered,” he said. 

As Brant listened to Rodson talk- 
about the Playground, the children, 
at shouted commands from their 
instructors, assembled in a rank and 
file in the center of the Playground. 

“Listen!” Rodson ordered. 

One of the briefly clad young 
women raised her arm. Music re- 
sembling a primitive rhythmical 
chant filled the air. The children 
sang as Brant and Lisa listened. 

We have fun. 

We have sun. 

We can fight. 

We are right. 

The Council leads us. 

The Council feeds us. 

Days of pleasure. 

Full of treasure. 

We are free! 

We are free! 

As the song ended the children 
were dismissed by a wave of the 

DREAMTOWN, U.S.A. 



song leader’s hand, and they raced 
wildly to the bright red barracks 
surrounding the Playground. Sev- 
eral of the younger children were 
knocked to the ground in the stam- 
pede, but they immediately scram- 
bled to their feet and joined the 
racing mob again. 

Brant thanked Kirk Rodson and 
walked with him to the door where 
they parted. The Watcher led them 
down the silent hall and they were 
soon out on the street again. 

“We have nothing to worry about 
if we train the kids that well,” Lisa 
remarked. 

“It’s kind of hard on them at 
first, I guess,” Brant observed. 

“They get used to it though. And 
anyway, we need strong people for 
Dreamtown with some of those 
crazy Rebels still running around 
loose,” Lisa said. 

“We don’t have to worry about 
them. After seeing those kids today, 
I don’t think we have to worry 
about anything,” Brant said as they 
walked down the street away from 
the Playground. 

Professor Corbett, in response to 
a knock, opened the door of the 
cabin to which he had moved after 
the Watcher’s attack on his farm- 
house and greeted the man who 
stood outside. 

“Jim. How are you?” the Profes- 
sor asked as he motioned the young 
man to a chair. 

“I passed your old place on my 
way here. Professor. It’s a good 
thing you got out of there. The 
Watchers must have come back 
because the place has been burned 
to the ground.” 

“We figured they’d be back once 
they knew our location. This cabin 

41 




is in bad shape but we were lucky to 
find it. And it’s isolated. Be hard to 
find, here in the middle of the 
woods. But now tell me Jim, what 
progress has been made?” 

“We’ve gotten a lot done in two 
weeks, Professor. I’ve just come 
from Andy. He and his people have 
moved up to the summit of Thorny 
Mountain. Joe and Ed have been 
in Dreamtown for almost the whole 
two weeks and are working as 
laborers on the housing project in 
the West End. Bill got himself a 
job as a messenger for the video 
control office and Mike is working 
in the mess hall at the central head- 
quarters of the Watchers.” 

“Fine, fine. That’s wonderful,” 
Professor Corbett exclaimed hap- 
pily. He hesitated a moment. 

“Mike,” Jim said, “overheard one 
of the Watchers telling about the 
raid on your place. He said they’ve 
got Nancy in one of the Detention 
Plants near the Watcher’s head- 
quarters.” 

“Is — ^is she all right, Jim? Could 
you find out if she’s all right?” the 
Professor asked hurriedly. 

“As far as we can tell, she’s OK. 
They’re holding her for question- 
ing. They’ll probably try to find out 
as much as they can about our 
plans before they — I mean — Jim 
hesitated, embarrassed. 

“I know, Jim. Wait a minute. I’ll 
call Dan. He’s upstairs taking a 
nap. He worked almost all night on 
the plans for the raid.” Professor 
Corbett called up the steps to Dan, 
and within a few minutes he ap- 
peared, rubbing the sleep from his 
eyes. 

“Jim,” Dan said, “have they 
found Nancy? Is she all right?” 
“She’s being held for question- 



ing, Dan,” Jim replied. 

Dan turned to Professor Corbett. 
“Alan, that means we’ve got to act 
fast. What’s the report from the 
others?” 

Jim outlined the progress that 
had been made since the night of 
the raid on the farmhouse. To- 
gether with Professor Corbett, they 
went over the details of the new 
outposts of the Rebel groups. They 
counted up the number of weapons 
possessed by each individual group, 
and checked and rechecked the 
positions that each group and each 
individual was to hold on the day 
of the raid. 

Jim told Dan of the positions 
that the four volunteers had ob- 
tained within Dreamtown, and Dan 
wrote out detailed instructions for 
them to follow on the day of the 
raid. 

“Get these instructions to Mike 
and the others within four days,” 
Dan ordered. “Wednesday of next 
week.” 

“This whole thing,” Professor 
Corbett said, “depends on our abil- 
ity to coordinate our actions. If 
there is one slip anywhere along the 
line the whole thing will fall to 
pieces. Jim, you and the other run- 
ners have an important job on your 
hands. You’ve got to get this in- 
formation to all the outposts and 
to the four men in the city by Mon- 
day. That will give everyone a day 
to prepare before Wednesday.” 

Jim took the sheets of paper from 
Dan, folded them, and placed them 
in the inside pocket of his jacket. 

“What are your plans for getting 
Nancy out.” Jim asked. 

Dan answered him. “In Mike’s 
instructions, I explained that he 
was to open the Detention Plant 

LEO P. KELLEY 



42 




and release Nancy and any of our 
other people that might be there. 
He’ll tell them what they’re to do. 
If he hears of anything happening 
before that time, we’ve got to de- 
pend on Mike to be able to save 
her.” 

“But if — Jim began. 

Professor Corbett held up his 
hand. 

“We cannot afford to jeopardize 
the whole plan for anyone’s sake.” 
He looked down at the floor. “Not 
even for the sake of my daughter.” 

Dan placed his hand on the Pro- 
fessor’s shoulder. “Nancy wouldn’t 
want it any other way, Alan,” he 
said. 

“Mike will have to handle any 
emergency that arises. He’s a good 
man and we can depend on him,” 
Dan added. 

“With the Playground Festival 
taking place next Wednesday it 
should be easier for us to get con- 
trol of the city. The Council has 
sent word that every adult must 
attend the ceremonies. We’ll have 
them all in one place and they’ll be 
easy to control.” 

“I’ll get going,” Jim said. “Got 
to be in a lot of places between now 
and Monday.” He stood up and 
the three men shook hands solemn- 

ly- 

“Good luck, Jim,” Professor Cor- 
bett said. 

Jim laughed. “See you in Dream- 
town, Professor!” 



G il PATTON and Brant 
showed their official cards to 
the Watcher behind the desk. Gil’s 
civilian investigative status gained 
him immediate entrance, but there 
was some discussion concerning 

DREAMTOWN, U.S.A 



Brant’s right to attend. The matter 
was finally cleared up to the 
Watcher’s satisfaction when Brant 
explained that Benton of the Sen- 
sory Com Center had arranged for 
him to attend. 

The two men were ushered into 
a large chamber, at one end of 
which was an enormous metal desk 
almost the width of the room. Eight 
men were seated behind it. Brant 
recognized the leader of the Watch- 
ers and several other officials of the 
city. He and Gil took seats to one 
side of the room near the desk. 

“They’re going to reexamine 
some of the Rebels that have been 
captured recently,” Gil said. 
“Should be amusing.” 

Brant nodded. 

At a signal, a Watcher opened a 
door at one side of the room. A 
young girl and a man and woman, 
were led into the room. They were 
led to a spot to stand directly in 
front of the examiners. 

“You are Rebels. Is that true?” 
barked the leader of the Watchers, 
who was conducting the examina- 
tion. 

None of the three answered. 

“You have been planning to 
destroy the city of Dream town?” 
the man asked. 

Again no one protested. He 
looked up. 

“You deny these charges?” He 
paused and then directed his atten- 
tion to the girl before him. 

“Your name!” 

“Nancy Corbett,” the girl said. 

“Perhaps you will tell us why 
your people are being so foolish.” 

Nancy smiled at the man, and 
spoke quietly. “We don’t believe we 
are being foolish.” 

The man laughed aloud and the 

43 




others joined him. Brant turned 
to Gil. “She’s not bad looking.” 

“Do your Rebels really believe 
you can destroy us?” 

“We don’t want to destroy you,” 
Nancy replied. “We have no inten- 
tions of doing that. We believe you 
are making many mistakes here in 
Dreamtown and we believe things 
must be changed,” she said. 

“And how do you intend to do 
that?” 

Nancy didn’t answer. 

The man stood up quickly and 
leaned across the desk. “Then you 
admit you are trying to destroy the 
way of life we have built up here,” 
he shouted. 

“No!” the man next to Nancy 
answered suddenly. “We’ve told 
you. We feel it is wrong and must 
be changed.” 

“We want things back the way 
they were before you came,” the 
woman said. 

“What do you mean?” the man 
roared again. 

“We want to read books and we 
want to hear the old music again. 
We want to raise our children the 
way they should be raised.” 

“When we win we are going to 
rebuild the schools,” Nancy said 
quickly. 

“Silence!” the man thundered. 

A man at the end of the desk 
rose. 

“Didn’t you always have enough 
to eat when you lived in Dream- 
town?” he asked. 

Again no one answered. 

“Didn’t you have enough to do 
for entertainment?” He looked from 
face to face before him. 

“Didn’t you enjoy yourselves 
here?” he asked. 

Nancy stepped forward. “That’s 

44 



just it! Here all we were able to do, 
all we were allowed to do, was en- 
joy ourselves. But only in your ways. 
Some of us felt there were better 
ways to enjoy ourselves than with 
parties and festivals and sensation 
pills.” 

“What ways?” the man asked 
quietly. 

The man next to Nancy spoke. 
“We wanted time to think. Some 
of us wanted to paint or write 
books.” 

“We wanted to be with our chil- 
dren,” the woman said. 

“Surely you realize by now,” the 
man continued from behind the 
desk, “how insignificant these 
things are in comparison to the 
progress we’ve made in Dream- 
town. Paintings done by hand can- 
not equal our paintings that are 
done mechanically. And as for 
books. One must be alone to read 
books and we believe that people 
should be together and share with 
one another.” 

“That’s just it,” Nancy said. 
“Reading a book is sharing some- 
thing! You share an experience 
with the man who wrote the book. 
You tell people about it, they read 
it, you discuss it. That’s sharing.” 

Another man at the desk spoke. 
“You talk of experience. With our 
sensation pills you gain much great- 
er and more vivid experience than 
you ever could from a book.” 

“But it’s not real that way,” 
Nancy said softly. “It’s not natural 
either.” 

The leader of the Watchers re- 
sumed the examination, which con- 
sisted of the same questions and the 
same accusations repeated over and 
over again. The three Rebels stood 
awaiting whatever it was that to be 

LEO P. KELLEY 




done to them, helpless to answer 
the charges, since there seemed to 
be no way for them to make them- 
selves understood. 

“What will they do with them?” 
Brant asked. 

“Psychwash them probably. It’s 
simple and there’s never any trou- 
ble afterward.” Gil answered. 

The leader stood up and ad- 
dressed the three individuals before 
him. 

“We have decided that you are 
to be sent to the psych laboratories!” 

The Rebel woman instinctively 
raised her hand to her mouth in 
fear. Nancy and the other man 
stiffened but their glances remained 
steady. 

“We will give you a day to think 
about what is to happen to you. 
If, in that time, you decide to come 
to us with information concerning 
your Rebel groups — their where- 
abouts, their plans and so on, you 
may do so. Otherwise our plans for 
you will be carried out!” 

He sat down. “Let me remind 
you that the fate of those who have 
been psychwashed is not very pleas- 
ant. They no longer think. They 
move when they are told to move. 
They do only what they are told 
to do. They don’t read books and 
they don’t paint pictures. They — .” 

“They are not very different from 
the rest of the people in Dream- 
town, are they?” Nancy inter- 
rupted. 

“Take them out of here!” the 
man screamed. 

Nancy’s remark created angry 
excitement among the examiners 
and as they discussed it among 
themselves Brant and Gil watched 
the three people being led swiftly 
from the room. 

DREAMTOWN, U.S.A. 



T he city lay like a ^eat car- 
nival ground in the wilderness, 
illuminating the dark night. Dan 
and Professor Corbett lay on the 
ground, hidden behind the scrubby 
growth of bushes a few hundred 
yards from the wall of the city. 

Dan looked at his watch and the 
luminous dial told him it was ten 
o’clock. The raid was scheduled for 
10 : 20 . 

“I think we got all the patrols, 
Alan,” Dan whispered, “but I 
warned the men to be careful any- 
way. We didn’t have enough guns 
for everybody, but once we’re in the 
city we can get them from the 
Watchers and from their arsenal.” 
Professor Corbett leaned toward 
Dan. “Let’s go over the plan once 
more,” he said. 

Dan shifted his position. “We 
have thirty people down at the 
West End gate. They’re coming in 
three minutes after we start. Bill 
and Ed will open this gate and at 
the same time Joe will dynamite the 
drug warehouses.” 

“Three of our men,” the Profes- 
sor said, “will head for the South 
gate as soon as we’re in, and three 
others will open the East gate. If 
the surprise is great enough, they 
shouldn’t have too hard a time 
overcoming the Watchers at the 
gates. They’ll be too confused to 
know what hit them.” 

“Mike,” Dan said, “will barri- 
cade the Watcher’s barracks at 
10 : 18 , and then wait until he is 
joined by the group from the West. 
That will only take a few minutes 
and, once there, the group will 
split. Part will keep the Watcher’s 
under control and the rest will in- 
vade the Detention Plant.” 

“Mike can pass out guns from 

45 




the Watcher’s arsenal to our people 
in the Plant and direct them to the 
Playground. I’ll head for the Play- 
ground as soon as we’re in,” the 
Professor continued, “and we’ll take 
over there.” 

“You’ll have the most men, 
Alan,” Dan said. “I’m taking eight 
men and heading for the Council 
Building. We’ll grab the Council 
and bring them to the Playground. 
Check, Alan?” 

“Check!” 

“It’s 10:16. Pass the word along 
to watch for the first sign of the 
gates opening,” Dan directed. 

Silence fell as each man in Dan’s 
group waited while the remaining 
minutes passed. Every eye was fixed 
on the city gates. 10:19. 10:20. 

“Let’s go!” Dan yelled at the 
top of his voice and leaped to his 
feet. The gigantic gates began to 
swing outward as the forty five men 
in Dan’s group sprang to their feet 
and raced, shouting, toward the 
opening gate. 

“This way!” a voice called shrilly. 

“It’s Ed!” Dan called to Pro- 
fessor Corbett who was running by 
his side. They reached Ed as the 
rest of the group entered the gate. 
Shots were being exchanged be- 
tween the Rebels and the Watchers 
now. 

“Where’s Bill?” Dan yelled above 
the noise. 

“They shot him,” Ed answered. 
“Come on!” 

Suddenly, a series of terrific ex- 
plosions filled the night with 
screaming sound. The earth shook 
under their feet. 

“The warehouses are gone!” Dan 
yelled. “I’m heading for the Coun- 
cil!” 

The eight men Dan had selected 

46 



raced after him down the empty 
street of the city. The sound of fir- 
ing, announcing the entry of the 
group at the East gate, met their 
ears. 

As Dan’s men careened around 
a corner they saw two Watchers 
sprinting toward them. One of the 
Rebels dropped to his knee, fired 
twice, and the two Watchers froze, 
in the typical macabre positions 
produced by a hypno-ray gun. 

The group parted and made 
separate approaches to the Council 
Building. 

Dan and four others stopped as 
they came in sight of the building. 
A group of Watchers stood, guns 
ready, peering up and down the 
deserted street. 

“Let’s go!” Dan yelled, and the 
Rebels sprang forward, dodging in 
and out of doorways for protection. 
The other Rebels appeared at the 
opposite end of the street. The 
Watchers, seeing themselves out- 
numbered, suddenly turned and 
fled up the steps of the Council 
Building. 

“Stop!” Dan shouted. He fired a 
warning shot and the fleeing 
Watchers halted. 

“They’ll serve as shields,” Dan 
muttered. “No telling what we’ll 
run into inside.” 

The Rebels moved forward, with 
the Watchers preceding them at 
gunpoint. Inside, the hall was silent 
and they walked cautiously, alert 
for any sudden action. 

“Don’t turn around,” Dan or- 
dered the men in front of him. 
“Lead us to the quarters of the 
Council.” 

The tense group continued 
through halls and rooms resplend- 
ently furnished and decorated. 

LEO P. KELLEY 




They stopped several yards from a 
steel door which faced them across 
a high ceilinged room. 

“Go on!” Dan ordered. 

“That’s the Council’s private 
apartment,” one of the Watchers 
snapped. 

“Open it!” 

“No one’s ever opened it. No 
one’s ever been inside,” the man 
answered. 

Dan turned to one of his men. 
“Try to open that door, but be 
ready for anything!” 

After some minutes, the man 
turned back to the group. 

“There doesn’t seem to be any 
way to get it open, Dan,” the man 
said. 

“Then we’ll blast it open!” 

But it was soon evident that their 
blasts had no effect on the massive 
structure. One of the Watchers 
sneered, when suddenly, without 
warning, the door slid aside into 
the wall. 

“Keep an eye on them,” Dan 
cautioned his men. 

He moved cautiously as he neared 
the open door. There was no sound 
from within and so far as he could 
tell the room was empty. He stepped 
inside. 

“Good evening!” a voice greeted 
him. 

Dan started, and his eyes quickly 
searched the room for the source of 
the voice that had delivered this 
unusual greeting. 

“Over here,” the voice said. A 
grotesquely fat man wearing a red 
robe, heavy with gold brocade rose 
from a reclining chair and smiled 
at Dan. 

“We’ve just — ,” Dan began but 
the fat man interrupted him. 

“I know! I’ve been expecting you 

DREAMTOWN, U.S.A 



for some time now. Have some 
grapes?” the man asked, indicating 
a bronze container on the table. “Or 
some wine?” he asked, proferring 
a silver decanter that stood beside 
the bronze dish of grapes. 

“Where are the other members 
of the Council?” Dan demanded. 

The man repressed a laugh. 
“There are no other members!” 

“You mean you — !” Dan stopped 
in utter amazement as the truth 
began to become clear to him. 

“Yes,” the man replied calmly. 

“But I don’t understand. How 
did you do it?” 

“Very simply. Are you sure you 
won’t have some wine?” The man 
poured himself a goblet of wine. 
“When Dreamtown began to be- 
come what it is today, I saw a per- 
fect opportunity to cash in, so to 
speak, on a good thing. The details 
aren’t important. I started small, 
and after I had sufficient power, I 
set up this legend of the Council. It 
was a simple thing to dispose of the 
few who knew the truth. Once that 
was done, the secret was easy to 
keep. I am self sufficient here. 
There has been no need to leave 
my apartments or my gardens. I 
send my directives, my orders, my 
requests, through the transitab or 
over the intercom. Food is left in 
an anteroom adjoining my cham- 
bers. Hardly anyone ever questioned 
me except in the beginning, and 
then there were always the Watch- 
ers, so the questioning soon stopped. 
Now, is there anything else you 
would like to know?” 

Dan turned and called to the 
others and they entered, their guns 
still trained on the Watchers. Dan 
explained what he had heard as 
they all listened in amazement. 



47 




“I don’t believe it! It’s a trick!” 
one of the Watchers blurted out. 

The little man chuckled. “My 
boy, the trick is over. He told you 
the truth.” 

“We’re leaving now, and we’re 
taking you with us to the Play- 
ground,” Dan said. 

“My wine first,” the man said 
and raised the goblet to his lips. 
“Yes, it’s all over,” he said softly 
and drained the goblet. 

Instantly the man’s body went 
limp and he slumped to the floor 
before the shocked eyes of the 
others in the room. 

Dan rushed forward and exam- 
ined the inert form on the floor. 
“He’s dead! We’ll have to leave him 
here. Lock the Watchers in that 
closet and let’s go. We’ve got to get 
to the Playground.” 

They raced down the steps of the 
Council Building and headed to- 
ward the Playground. Occasionally 
they met a citizen of Dreamtown 
who fled before them in fear or 
merely stared in stupefied amaze- 
ment. 

The Playground gates were open 
and there were Rebels surrounding 
its walls, their guns trained on cap- 
tured groups of Watchers who stood 
sullenly, staring for the most part, 
at the ground. A cheer went up 
from the Rebels as they saw Dan 
and the others approaching. The 
courtyard of the Playground was 
dotted with Rebels guarding the 
great crowd that filled the stands 
which had been erected for the 
Festival. 

In the center of the courtyard 
was a platform on which stood 
Professor Corbett and some of the 
Other Rebels. Dan yelled in delight 



as he recognized Nancy standing 
beside her father. 

In a great bound he was on the 
platform and Nancy was in his 
arms. 

When he released her, he 
spoke quietly to Professor Corbett. 

“Everything all right?” he asked. 

“Yes. We lost some men, but 
everything went according to plan.” 

Dan turned to the shouting, fear- 
ful crowd before him in the stands. 
He raised his gun and fired three 
successive shots into the night air. 
The crowd quieted. 

“We intend no harm,” Dan be- 
gan, “most of you have heard of 
us. They called us Rebels. We 
were. We once lived in Dreamtown. 
After the Big War we tried to build 
a new civilization, one founded in 
truth and dignity. At that time we 
all wanted the same thing. Then 
some people came and offered us 
toys instead of truth. Many of us 
took the toys. After the horrors of 
the Big War we wanted peace and 
contentment and pleasure. But we 
made a terrible mistake. We took 
these toys hoping they would give 
us the thing we looked for, and as 
years went by we forgot what we 
had set out to do. But some of us 
didn’t forget. Some of us remem- 
bered. And we fled from Dream- 
town, because the Council and the 
Watchers told us we were wrong 
to want those things. The Council 
no longer exists. There isn’t time 
to explain it all to you now. You 
will be informed quickly and com- 
pletely as soon as we are able to 
arrange it. One more thing. We do 
not come as conquerors, but as 
friends. We came back because we 
believed in Dreamtown, and wanted

THE BIG LEAP 

BY CHARLES E. FRITCH 



I T DID not terrify Cantrell to 
know he was up so high and go- 
ing so fast, going higher and faster 
than any human before him. He 
would be up even higher the next 
day, he remembered, going so high 
and so fast he would not come down 
again. 

It would be a shame to leave 
Earth, he knew. There was security 
in her firmness, with no great space 
underfoot through which to drop 
down, down, down. Up here there 
was emptiness all around. Empti- 
ness and, except for the dull throb 
of the rocket engines, silence. Out 
there — he looked up — ^there would 

49 



be a greater emptiness, a greater 
silence, an infinity of nothingness 
in all directions. 

He felt suddenly cold at the 
thought, and then shame swept 
over him, forcing the paralysis aside. 
Fear of the unknown again, he 
thought distastefully. No matter 
how much the psychologists tried, 
they could not erase that icy prick- 
ling sensation that came with its 
contemplation. They were all chil- 
dren when it came to space, kids 
frightened by the dark alleys of the 
universe, fearing the bogey man 
that waited lurking in the velvet 
depths through which no one had 




passed before. Probably they would 
find nothing out there to fear, noth- 
ing at all, and yet the feeling would 
go on and on, whenever men had to 
face the unknown, whenever they 
had to force themselves whistling 
past silent graveyards that con- 
tained only the fear of fear. 

With swift precision he pressed 
studs on the control panel before 
him, and a bank of jets on the side 
of his rocket flared into sudden life, 
pushing, turning, pulsing flame into 
the thin air of the outside. His gyro- 
chair made an effortless compensa- 
tion for the altered direction. The 
ship banked, leveled, then leaped 
forward on a new course. Cantrell 
smiled. He could handle the ship 
now as though it were a part of 
him. On the big leap he expected 
no trouble. 

Not so the planners, who refused 
to leave the minutest stone un- 
turned in their search for flaws in 
man or rocket. Physical checkups 
were made as often as twice a day. 
Psychiatrists had analyzed him con- 
stantly during the past six months, 
probing for any hidden factors that 
might make a space flight futile, 
fearing perhaps a mental return to 
the womb for a security that could 
not be found in untraveled space. 
We’re all children when it comes 
to space, he reminded himself, and 
he laughed and wondered half-seri- 
ously if he were really as psy- 
chologically free as he thought he 
was — excepting his animal allergy 
of course, which was insignificant. 
There were many facets of the 
human mind the clinical instru- 
ments of psychology could never 
hope to touch; the mind was like 
an iceberg, and the submerged nine- 
tenths could hold a great many un- 

50 



fathomables hidden in the vast 
depths, subtle monstrosities waiting 
to spring out and claw at his 
sanity. 

He smiled grimly, as he realized 
where his thoughts were leading 
him. To fear of the unknown again. 
Of course, it was only the intellec- 
tual contemplation of it, but the 
mere thought disturbed him, and he 
began to feel angry at himself for 
allowing the thoughts to exist at 
all. 

Irritably he jabbed at the con- 
trols and felt the reassuring thrusts 
that drove him gently into the 
heavy-padded cushions of the seat. 
With a smile, this time of satisfac- 
tion, he watched the speedometer 
needle rise to a new height. Below 
him, Earth was an unfamiliar blur, 
and he touched off the braking 
rockets to look at it. 

The landscape took on more 
familiar features, with its surface 
pockmarked by the ravages of wind 
and rain, its broad fields stretching 
out in all directions like the fur on 
some great animal. He failed to sup- 
press a shudder of disgust at that 
last thought. He’d be glad to get off 
Earth, onto the moon where he 
would be alone for awhile and away 
from the unpleasantnesses of ordi- 
nary life. These past months, with 
Jarvis and his dogs, the psychia- 
trist’s incessant questioning — 

The radio said into his ears: 
“Okay, Cantrell, that’s enough of 
a workout. Bring her in and report 
to HQ. Colonel Enders wants a 
word with you.” 

“Right,” Cantrell said into a 
microphone. He switched off the 
radio and muttered : “Damn 

Colonel Enders. What’s he want 
this time, to check the nipples on 

CHARLES E. FRITCH 




my beer bottles?” 

Angrily, he flipped the rocket into 
a soundless dive that reached 
screaming proportions as he entered 
heavier atmosphere. The outer 
metal glowed, and the temperature 
rose in the controlroom. He twisted 
the rocket onto a tail of flame and 
settled, 

“And that’s that — until tomor- 
row,” he told himself. 

He threw switches to inactivate 
the motors and looked out an ob- 
servation window. A fast-moving 
jeep curved across the stretch of 
sand towards him. Behind the jeep 
a dog came running; at the sight of 
the animal, Cantrell felt nausea tug 
at him. He reached for the radio. 

He said into it, “Control? Get 
that damned dog off the field.” 
“Sorry,” Control said, “I’ll con- 
tact the jeep. One of Captain Jar- 
vis’ dogs got loose, and — ” 

“I’m not interested in your ex- 
cuses,” Cantrell said angrily, “and 
I don’t care if it does belong to Cap- 
tain Jarvis. Get it off the field, or 
I’ll blast it off!” Irritably, he cut 
communications. 

He looked out the window. The 
jeep had stopped, and someone 
had gotten out and was walking 
back to collar the dog and return it. 
The jeep started up again. 

Cantrell breathed a sigh of relief. 
He felt annoyed with himself, as 
he always did when something like 
this happened, but the self-con- 
demnation failed to placate him. 
Damn it! Jarvis was a psychiatrist; 
the man knew how these things 
affected him. To make matters 
worse, it was Jarvis’ dog. Probably 
trying another of his “experiments”, 
Cantrell thought disgustedly. 

He crawled out of the airlock and 



down the long metal stairs to the 
ground. The jeep pulled up, and 
the khaki-clad driver said, “Sorry 
about the dog, sir, but — ” 

“Skip it,” Cantrell snapped, 
climbing into the jeep. “Just take 
me to HQ.” 

The soldier nodded and spun the 
jeep around. They went flashing 
toward a fat clump of buildings that 
squatted alone at the edge of the 
landing field. 

As Cantrell had expected. Cap- 
tain Jarvis was with Colonel Enders 
in the latter’s office. 

“What was the idea of sending 
out that mongrel,” Cantrell flared. 
“You know I’m allergic to animals.” 
“It was an accident. Besides, 
you’re not allergic to anything,” the 
psychiatrist said calmly, ignoring 
the insult to his pet. “You’re ration- 
alizing a pathological fear — ” 
“Now, see here — ” 

Captain Jarvis held up a placat- 
ing hand “ — or hatred, if you wish, 
of animals.” 

“Okay, okay, I don’t like ani- 
mals,” Cantrell said. “We’ve been 
over that a dozen times. So what? I 
suppose you still think it has some 
bearing on my going to the moon 
and back?” 

The psychiatrist shrugged. “Who 
knows? It might have.” 

Colonel Enders said, “I’m begin- 
ning to agree with Cantrell, Cap- 
tain. We’re not going to find anyone 
perfect, it seems, so we may as well 
take those with the best qualifica- 
tions. Cantrell certainly isn’t going 
to encounter animals in space, and 
there’s no life on the moon; our 
foremost scientists assure us of that.” 
“But can you be sure,” the psy- 
chiatrist wondered, “can they be 
sure, can anybody be sure? Scien- 

51 



THE BIG LEAP 




tists don’t have all the right answers 
about our Earth, much less the 
other planets; we know as much 
about Earth as a flea knows about 
the dog or the cat he’s on.” 

Cantrell grimaced at the analogy. 
“That’s why we’re going up, to find 
a few answers. Anyway, tomorrow 
I’ll be on my way because I’ve got 
the qualifications for it, animals or 
no animals. And if the moon has 
creatures on it that resemble dogs 
or cats or even fleas. I’ll be mighty 
surprised. How about you. Colo- 
nel?” 

“Don’t drag me into your argu- 
ments, Cantrell,” the Colonel 
sighed. “I’m a military man, not a 
scientist. Both the Earth and the 
moon may be green cheese for all I 
know. The main thing I’m in- 
terested in is that you get up there 
and back safely.” 

“I will,” Cantrell promised. 

“I hope you do,” Captain Jarvis 
said earnestly. “I’m not trying to 
heap obstacles in your path, Can- 
trell. It’s just that we know so little 
about anything that even an ‘al- 
lergy’ like yours might be a hazard. 
Suppose up there, for example, it 
suddenly took on cockeyed propor- 
tions and went to lesser animals; 
suppose a fly accidentally got aboard 
the rocket, you might even open a 
hatch to get away from it — and 
forget to put on your spacesuit.” 

“Thank the fates I’m not a mili- 
tary man, Jarvis, and can speak 
freely,” Cantrell said dryly. “You 
already know I don’t like you, and 
I’m beginning to like you even less.” 

“Come, come,” Colonel Evans 
said hastily, “there’s no point in 
arguing. We can’t get perfection. 
I’m afraid. Cantrell here’s the 
closest to our qualifications we could 



get, physically and psychologically, 
consistent with the right back- 
ground for the job. Tomorrow at 
noon the rocket’s going to take ofT 
with Cantrell aboard, and then we’ll 
know.” 

“Yes,” the psychiatrist said stead- 
ily, “and then we’ll know.” 

Cantrell turned to Colonel Evans. 
“Will that be all, Colonel?” 

Evans glanced hastily at Jarvis 
and nodded. “That’s it, I guess — 
until tomorrow at noon.” 

“Right,” Cantrell said. “See 
you.” And he went out. 

Once outside in the warm after- 
noon sun he mentally damned Jar- 
vis and Evans, classifying them both 
as incompetents who drew military 
salary for putting red-taped im- 
pediments in the way of progress; 
the rocket should have taken off 
months ago. 

He shrugged, trying to content 
himself with the thought that to- 
morrow he’d be away from them, 
away floating in the pure emptiness 
of space. Even so, the mere thought 
of Jarvis irritated him, made his 
fingers itch for the man’s throat; 
him and his talk of animal fears! 

Okay, so he hated animals, well 
he had good reason to. Ever since 
that dog had attacked him when he 
was a child, he’d hated dogs; and 
then the hatred spread to other ani- 
mals — why not, for they all were 
potentially dangerous — and some- 
times it even made him sick to 
think of them. It made sense when 
you stopped to consider it carefully. 
He’d moved to the city, to the great 
steel canyons that imprisoned only 
specimens of humanity, and for 
years never saw an animal. Now, he 
was in the open again, in the great 
desert and the plains. But Acre 

53 




were no animals, only the dogs Cap- 
tain Jarvis insisted on keeping. 

“Nuts to Captain Jarvis,” he 
said. 

The next morning he felt the 
same way. He was called into HQ 
for last minute instructions that 
were the same as those laid out 
months ago. Cantrell knew them by 
memory, but the excitement of the 
impending blastoff prevented his 
being bored or even from being 
annoyed by the psychiatrist’s in- 
evitable presence. Now there was 
nothing to prevent the leap of the 
Earthbound into space; not even 
Jarvis could delay it now. 

The jeep drove Jarvis, Evans and 
Cantrell to the waiting rocket. They 
got out. 

Evans offered his hand. “Good- 
bye, Cantrell, come back in one 
piece.” 

“Sorry I was so hard on you, 
Cantrell,” Jarvis said, extending his 
hand. “I hope you make it okay.” 

Cantrell nodded and took the 
man’s hand. “Thanks. I expect to.” 

He climbed the ladder to the air- 
lock door and stood there for a 
moment watching the jeep carry 
its passengers across the field to a 
safe distance. Then he went inside 
and strapped himself into the seat. 

“Okay, Cantrell,” Control said. 
“Blast off when ready.” 

“Right,” Cantrell said into the 
radio. He closed the airlock door 
and checked pressure gauges. “In 
ten seconds,” he said, activating the 
firing mechanism. Mentally he 
counted: ten, nine, eight, seven . 

The rocket shuddered, and Can- 
trell found himself pressed suddenly 
into the seat. In the viewscreens 
Earth spun dizzily away from him. 
After a few minutes the push ceased 

54 



and weightlessness began. 

“Everything okay, Cantrell?” the 
radio said, after awhile. It was 
Evans. 

“Fine, Colonel,” Cantrell said. 
“Not a dog or a cat in sight.” 
“Can you see Earth?” 

Cantrell manipulated dials, acti- 
vating the lower television eyes. 
“There she is,” he said. “Looks real 
impressive. I can see nearly all of 
North America now and a good 
part of the Pacific. The land looks 
queer from up here,” — he frowned 
— “something like — ” He broke off, 
staring. “Like — ” 

“Like what?” Jarvis’ voice de- 
manded suddenly. “It looks like 
what, Cantrell?” 

Cantrell shook his head be- 
wilderedly. “Nothing,” he said un- 
certainly. He felt a sudden irritation 
that Jarvis couldn’t let him alone 
even with so much of space inter- 
vening. “It looks like I’m going to 
make it to the moon, that’s all.” 
“You were going to say some- 
thing else, Cantrell, what?” 

“Let him alone, Jarvis,” Evans 
whispered; “he’s got enough to 
worry about.” 

“That’s right,” Cantrell said ir- 
ritably, “and I’m going to worry 
about it in silence.” He reached for 
the radio switch. 

“But, Cantrell — ” Evans said. 
Then the radio went dead. 

Cantrell grinned and watched 
Earth getting smaller below. The 
grin faded as he thought of his al- 
most-spoken comparison of a few 
minutes before, of the land resem- 
bling the shriveled skin of an ani- 
mal. Jarvis would have made much 
of that, of course, with his psychi- 
atric ramblings. Yet, the comparison 
was disturbing just the same. Why 

CHARLES E. FRITCH 




did he torture himself? 

He regarded Earth skeptically, 
hoping to subdue the irrational 
thoughts. Certainly the shape was 
not that of an animal. At least not 
an Earth animal. But then it 
wouldn’t have to be, he reminded 
himself — and felt doubly irritated 
at the reminder. It looked very 
different from the globes he’d seen 
picturing the planet. It looked al- 
most — alive. From this height, great 
forests resembled tiny hairs, moun- 
tain ridges and canyons were skin 
blemishes and pores ; the great 
oceans looked like giant mouths, 
open and hungry. 

Cantrell laughed nervously. It 
was ridiculous. Yet the more he 
looked, the more Earth receded be- 
low him, the more the resemblances 
increased. He stared at the planet. 
It was ridiculous, but there were 
even several portions below that 
looked like great eyes staring at 
him. As he watched, one blinked. 

Cantrell screamed. The sound 
was shrill in the narrow control 
chamber. Then he cursed and felt 
ashamed. 

“I’m going crazy,” he told him- 
self. His voice was hoarse. “Jarvis 
was right.” 

But the thought failed to help. 
The sudden feeling of terror was 
still with him, and he found himself 
trembling. It was only a cloud, he 
told himself, only a cloud passing 
over a section of land that from this 
distance looked like an eye. He tried 
to laugh away the fear, but the 
sound stuck in his throat. He felt 
his heart beating faster than it 
should. 

“No,” he said desperately, look- 
ing away, “no, I’m okay. My mind 
is clear, and I’m all right. It’s just 

THE BIG LEAP 



being up here that gives a guy the 
jitters. Fear of the unknown. Things 
look different when you’re not close 
to them. Got to calm down. Take it 
easy.” 

His hands trembled. 

“Scientists don’t have all the right 
answers even about our Earth 
here,” Jarvis had said. “We know 
as much about Earth as a flea 
knows about the dog orithe cat he’s 
on.” 

The words echoed in Cantrell’s 
memory, and he forced himself to 
look down at Earth. It was a planet, 
that was all, an inanimate mass and 
nothing more. “. as much as a 
flea knows . .” But was it possible 
that a flea might not realize the 
animal he was on was an animal? 

He had a headache, and he shook 
his head in an effort to clear it. His 
vision blurred, refocussed with as- 
tounding clarity. Lines flowed to- 
gether with sudden meaning. Be- 
fore his gaze rivers became veins, 
eyes stared at him curiously, ocean- 
mouths yawned. The truth burst 
upon him then, with a sudden flash 
that drove his blood coursing 
through his body, with a realization 
that jerked him as though he had 
been struck with a whip. He 
laughed insanely at the thought, 
and the laughter exploded in the 
narrow cabin and flowed over him 
in torrents, echoing. 

He was the only one in the world 
who could see things as they really 
were. He was as certain of that as 
he was of his own existence. He 
knew now, and his was the only 
knowledge: Earth was a space ani- 
mal, the humans parasites like fleas 
on a cat or a dog. And the Earth- 
lings didn’t know, they didn’t even 
suspect! 



55 




The radio buzzed. He pressed a 
button. 

“Cantrell,” Evans’ harassed voice 
came. “This is an order: maintain 
contact at all times, until the mo- 
ment you set foot back on Earth. 
Understand?” 

Cantrell laughed with his strange 
secret knowledge. “Fm not coming 
back,” he said happily. He was the 
only one who could escape this ani- 
mal, the only one, and he felt elated 
at this, felt a sense of power he’d 
not known. “Fm not going to be a 
parasite crawling on the back of an 
animal.” The thought sickened 
him, and he gagged. 

“Cantrell!” It was Jarvis. “Can- 
trell, listen to me — ” 

“No,” Cantrell said. “You listen 
to me.” 

And he told them about Earth 
being a space-animal. His mind re- 
belled at the thought, but he forced 
himself on for he wanted Jarvis to 
suffer down there, he wanted them 
all to suffer with the knowledge 
of what they were. Where was their 
pompous self-importance now, their 
flea’s dream of conquering the uni- 
verse? 

“He’s crazy,” Evans whispered. 

“Cantrell, listen to me,” Jarvis 
said. 

But Cantrell was staring in horri- 
fied fascination at Earth dwindling 
below, at the space-animal watch- 
ing him. “No!” he cried. “No, it’s 
too late.” And he shut off the radio 
and ripped the wires from their 
moorings. 

Ahead of him lay the moon. He 
switched screens to look at it. It 
was chalky and pockmarked, like 
the skin of a diseased animal. Great 
iridescent veins glowed through its 
body. From a crater bed a great 

56 



baleful eye regarded him. 

Cantrell screamed again and 
frantically pressed studs on the 
control panel. The rocket shot flame 
from its side tubes and turned in a 
short arc, swinging the moon from 
sight. The forward viewscreens 
showed the stars now, and beyond 
them an infinite blackness. 

“I’ll be safe out there,” Cantrell 
told himself. 

The rocket leaped forward. 



Y OU WERE right,” Evans said 
bitterly, putting down the ra- 
diophone with a gesture of helpless- 
ness. “Now, what do we do?” 
Jarvis shrugged. “Start over,” he 
said. “What else is there to do? 
Find someone else to pilot another 
rocket.” 

“Someone without Cantrell’s hal- 
lucinations,” Jarvis ammended. 

“And pray that they were hallu- 
cinations,” Jarvis amended fur- 
ther. 

Evans looked at him sharply. 
“What do you mean?” 

Jarvis said calmly, “My favorite 
theme, Colonel — simply that we 
don’t know much about this blob 
of matter we’re on. One factor dis- 
turbs me : while Cantrell was afraid 
of animals, he never imagined he 
saw them. Outside of his one idio- 
syncrasy, he was a very sound per- 
son. 

“What are you getting at?” 
Evans demanded irritably. 

“That it’s unfortunate Cantrell 
had this animal fear; it’s much too 
easy to blame that for what he saw. 
As a psychiatrist, I suppose I should 
say that’s the reason for it; I might 
be right. But it has also occurred to 
me I might be rationalizing.” He 

CHARLES E. FRITCH 




leaned forward, intensely serious. 
“Suppose, just suppose for a minute 
that maybe the ones who are 
wrong, that maybe we’re really 
parasites on an alien organism, that 
maybe we’re under a kind of mass 
auto-hypnosis to protect our pride, 
and that maybe space restores our 
sanity — ^for awhile anyway, until 
another form of insanity takes 
over.” 

“Anyone who supposed that 
would be crazy,” Evans blurted. 

“Perhaps,” Jarvis admitted, “but 
who’s to tell? I wonder, does the 
flea know the true nature of the 
dog, or does he thing he^s living on 
some kind of world built just for 
him?” 

Evans sputtered, searching for 
words. Finally he managed, “See 
here. Captain, this is nonsense, and 
I order you to stop such talk imme- 
diately.” 

Jarvis sighed. “I hope so. Colo- 
nel, I really hope it is nonsense. 
Man is a proud animal; it’s in- 
teresting to consider how such 
knowledge would affect him.” He 
shrugged helplessly and turned to 
leave the room. “At any rate, the 
only way to find out is to send up 
another man in another rocket and 
hope he doesn’t report the same 
thing; if he does, we’ll just blame 
it on one of his psychological quirks, 
and try again. But for all we know 
about this universe. Earth might be 
a space-animal, a type of life so 
close to us and yet so alien we don’t 
even recognize it — or don’t want 
to!” 



Colonel Evans wet his lips. “Do 
you — do you really believe that, 
Captain?” 

Jarvis considered the question. 
“No,” he said slowly. “No, I don’t. 
But I do think it points up an im- 
portant fact. When a man gets out 
there in space, cut off from every- 
thing he’s ever known, allergies, 
idiosyncrasies, personal likes and 
dislikes — everything on a conscious 
and a subconscious level may take 
on an exaggerated importance.” 

“You make it a big problem,” 
Evans said. 

“It is a big problem,” Jarvis 
sighed. “At any rate. I’m going to 
volunteer for the next flight. That’s 
the least I can do for Cantrell.’’ He 
went out. 

The Colonel stared after him, 
puzzled and slightly indignant. He 
shook his head. The man was crazy. 
Earth an animal — the idea was pre- 
posterous. But the thought ham- 
mered at him, repeating. Jarvis was 
right, of course, when he said it was 
undoubtedly psychological. And yet 
suppose — ^just suppose. 

Trembling, he shook off the 
thought and looked out at the field, 
the buildings, the sky. Earth’s pale 
satellite emerging from the sky like 
a child following in the wake of its 
mother. They say the moon came 
out of Earth, he thought suddenly, 
and the analogy struck home. The 
man in the moon looked down at 
him, and he turned hastily away. 

The afternoon was warm, but 
Colonel Evans suddenly felt very 
cold. • • •

THE BIG LEAP

OUR 

TOWN 

The jets got all 
the young ones in Smoky 
Creek. Only the old 
folks were left — 
with their memories. 

And the jets — friendly 
or hostile — would 
never get them . 

BY JEROME BIXBY 



A JET BOMBER and four 
fighters had appeared low over 
Bald Ridge, out of the east. They^d 
curved up as one to clear Law- 
son’s Hill, their stubby wings al- 
most brushing the treetops, their 
hiss and thunder rolling back and 
forth between the valley walls like 
a giant’s derision; they’d dipped 
into the valley proper, obviously 
informed that Smoky Greek, Ten- 
nessee (population 123) had no 
anti-aircraft installations, and cir- 
cled the town at about five hun- 
derd feet. They circled and looked 
down — broad slavic faces with cur- 
ious expressions, seen through plex- 
iglass, as if thinking: So this is an 
American small town. 

Then they took altitude and got 
to work. The first bomb was aimed 
at the big concrete railway bridge 
spanning the upper end of the val- 
ley; that was the main objective of 
the attack. The bomb exploded 
four hundred yards north of the 
bridge, at about six hundred feet 
altitude — the ideal point from 
which to flatten Smoky Greek. Low 
altitude bombing can be tricky, of 
course, especially in mountain 
country. A-bombs were cheap 
though, turned out by the carload; 
not like 20 years before, when they 
were first developed. So it was 
likely the bombardier tripped a 
bomb over the town just for the 
hell of it. 

The next bomb got the bridge. 
The next tore up a quarter mile 
of track. The next tore up a 
quarter mile of road. That was the 
mission. The bomber circled, while 
the fighters strafed Smoky Greek 
for good measure; and then they 
roared away past Lawson’s Hill, 
over Bald Ridge, into the east to- 



58 





ward their invasion-coast base. 

Everybody died. The bombs were 
midget A’s, designed for tactical 
use; so Smoky Greek wasn’t reduced 
to dust — just to sticks. There wasn’t 
much heat from the bomb and 
there was hardly any residual ra- 
diation. But everybody in town 
died. Concussion. Smoky Creek 
had been comprised of one main 
street and three cross streets, and 
that’s not much area — the wave 
had thumped down from right 
above, like a giant fist. 



Everybody died, except twenty- 
one old men and women who had 
been off in the woods at the far 
end of the valley, on their annual 
Grandfolk’s Picnic. They didn’t 
die, except inside. 

Three months later, an enemy jet 
came out of the sky and over the 
valley. A scoop arrangement under 
its belly was sniffing Tennessee and 
Alabama air for radioactive par- 
ticles. It sniffed low over the town, 
and then again — a ruined town 



59 



might hide an underground lab 
and converter — and then it barrel- 
rolled and crashed. Nine rifle bul- 
lets had hit the motor; straight back 
through the jet intake, into the 
blades. 

A year after that another jet 
came low over the town, and it 
crashed too. Only three bullets this 
time; but a jet motor’s like a tur- 
bine — ^you get a blade or two, and 
it goes crazy. 

Two years after that, Ben Bates 
(no longer Mayor Ben, because a 
mayor has to have a town; but still 
the man in charge) knocked off 
playing horseshoes in what had 
been the Town Hall. Now the 
building served as a recreation hall ; 
there were horseshoe pits at one 
end of the long room, there were 
tables for checkers and cards, and 
a short tenpin alley along one wall. 
Three years ago the alley had been 
twice as long as it was now; but 
then there were young men around 
who could peg the length of it with- 
out tiring every time. Overhead the 
roof sagged, and in one place you 
could see quite a piece of sky — but 
under the hole the old men had 
rigged a slanted board watershed 
that led to a drainage ditch; and 
scattered through the room were a 
lot of supporting posts and timber 
braces. Actually the building was 
about as safe as it had ever been. 

There were other buildings like 
it; buildings that the bomb hadn’t 
poimded flat or made too risky. 
They were propped up and nailed 
together and buttressed and prac- 
tically glued so they’d stay up. From 
outside you’d think they were go- 
ing to crumble any minute — walls 
slanted all cockeyed, boards peeled 
off and hanging, and roofs buck- 

60 



ling in. But they were safe. Fixed 
up every which way — ^from the in- 
side. All from the inside; not an 
inch of repair on the outside. It 
had to be that way, because the 
town had to look like a dead town. 

After the men had finished prop- 
ping, the women had come along 
with all the furniture and things 
they’d salvaged, and they swept 
and scrubbed and did a hundred 
jobs the men never would have 
thought of; and so the old people 
ended up with half a dozen build- 
ings to live in, secretly and com- 
fortably, in the town that had to 
look dead. 

“Arthritis is bad,” Ben Bates told 
his teammates and opponents. 
“Hell, I’m just giving away points. 
Maybe next week. I’ll rest up, and 
kick you all around next week.” 

He lit a cigar, a big grey man 
with long legs and a good-humored 
mouth, and he watched Dan Paray 
throw one short; then he strolled 
over to kibitz at the checker game 
between Fat Sam Hogan and 
Windy Harris, at one of the tables 
near the door. Late morning sun- 
light slanted in through the win- 
dow by the table and struck light 
off Windy’s glasses as he leaned 
across the board, thumped a check- 
er three times and said triumphant- 
ly, “King me, Sam. You’re getting 
blind, I swear. Or dumber.” 

Behind his back Ben Bates heard 
a shoe ring against the stake; then 
he heard it spin off, and he grinned 
at Owen Urey’s bullfrog cussing. 

Tom Pace was saying urgently, 
“Look — look, Jim, damn it, you 
didn’t no more shoot down that 
plane singlehanded than I did. We 
was all shooting. Godamighty — 
where you get off claiming you 

JEROME BIXBY 




bning it down?” 

Ben turned and sat down at the 
table next to the checker game, and 
stretched his legs in the sunlight. 
He raised thick brows like clumps 
of steel-wool at Tom and at old Jim 
Liddel, who sat in his pillowed arm- 
chair like a thin, scowling, bald, 
mansized spider. 

“You keep talking so high and 
mighty,” Tom said, “we’ll carry 
you out o’ here and take you and 
dump you in the creek. You can 
tell the fish about who got the 
plane.” 

“Still arguing over who planted 
the shot, huh,” Ben grinned. “Reg- 
ular feud, you two.” 

“Well, hell, Ben,” Tom said, and 
bit down on his gums so his whis- 
kers almost hid the end of his nose. 
“I just get filled up on this old 
windbag hollering how he — ” 

“You go call me a windbag once 
more, Tom Pace,” Jim Liddel said, 
and he stirred his all but helpless 
body in the armchair, “you’re 
gonna have a sore eye, you seventy 
year old whippersnapper. I brung 
it down.” 

“In a hog’s behind, you brung it 
down. Mister Dan’l Boone!” 

“It ’us just after I let loose it 
started smoking,” old Jim snarled, 
“and nobody else was shooting right 
then! You’re gonna get a sore eye, 
I swear — tobacco in it. I can spit 
to where you sit, and I can 
spit faster’n you can move, I bet, 
unless you’re faster’n a fly, and you 
ain’t. You just ask anybody who was 
there ... it ’us just after I shot it 
started — ” 

Tom Pace thumped the table. “/ 
was there, you old . now, now, 
Jim, don’t spit, for Godsake! Hold 
on. What I mean, I was there too. 



and maybe somebody’s shot from a 
second or two before was what done 
the trick. Maybe even my shot! 
Takes a plane a while to know it’s 
hurt, don’t it? Ever think o’ that?” 
“Maybe,” Ben Bates said. “May- 
be, maybe. And maybe. Let it go, 
you two. It ain’t important who 
done it; we oughta just be grateful 
we got it.” 

“Grateful I got it,” Jim Liddel 
grunted. 

Tom Pace said, “Now, looky 
here, Jim — ” Ben Bates nudged 
Tom’s leg under the table; and 
then slowly, fingering his jaw he 
said, “Well, now, Jim ... I figure 
maybe you did, at that. Like you 
say, it smoked and crashed right 
after you shot, so I always kind o’ 
figured it was you brought it down. 
But that’s a hard thing to prove.” 
Jim snorted. “Can’t prove it! But 
I got it, all right. A man knows 
when he sunk a shot.” 

“In a varmint, maybe,” Tom 
Pace objected, “or a man. But you 
claiming to know where to hit a 
plane the worst?” 

“We was all shooting at the front, 
up where they put the motor,” Jim 
said nastily. “Don’t know about 
planes, but I know my aim. I got 
it square-on.” 

“Well,” Ben said, “why don’t 
you just let it lay, eh, Tom? Jim’s 
got a lot on his side.” He looked 
sidewise at old Jim, and saw that 
Jim was still scowling at Tom. Old 
Jim was ninety eight, and some set 
in his notions. 

“Mm. Hell,” Tom said reluctant- 
ly, after a second, “I ain’t saying 
you didn't, Jim. That ain’t my in- 
tent. I just get burned when you 
yell you did, like no man dared say 
you was wrong. Sure, maybe you’re 

61 



OUR TOWN 




right. But ain’t you willing to ad- 
mit you might be wrong too?” 

Jim Liddel yelled, and 
from the checker table came Windy 
Harris’s encouraging, “You tell ’em 
who got that plane, Jim!” 

Ben Bates scraped an inch of 
ash off his cigar against the table- 
edge, sighed and got up. He looked 
down at the glowering pair and 
said, “Well, come the next plane, if 
there is one, we’ll shove a rifle in 
your hand, Jim, and see how good 
your eye is. You too, Tom. Till that 
time, reckon this is no place for a 
reasoning man.” 

“Sit down, Ben Bates,” old Jim 
snarled. “If you’re a reasoning man, 
sit down. Be glad to talk to one, 
after Tom here goes away.” 

“You go to hell. I ain’t going no 
place,” Tom said, and he picked 
up the cards and started shuffling 
them in his stiff hands. 

Ben sat down and stretched out 
his legs again. 

After a second, old Jim said wist- 
fully, “You know, I wish I could 
still handle a rifle, Ben. Or do any- 
thing but sit. No way for a man to 
live, to have dead legs and dying 
arms.” He shifted in his cushions. 
“You know, I reckon when I start 
to really die — die all over — I’m 
gonna get up out o’ this chair. I’ll 
stand up, somehow, even if it kills 
me faster. A man oughta fall when 
he dies, like a tree, so they know he 
stood up in his time. A man 
oughtn’ta die sitting down.” 

“Sure, Jim,” Ben said. “You’re 
right about that.” 

“Never had a sick day in my 
life, until they dropped that bomb. 
Why, I could outpitch and outchop 
and outshoot any of you whipper- 
snappers, until they . Old Jim 

62 



walloped the chair arm. “Damn, I 
made up for it, though! Didn’t I? 
They put me in a chair, I sat in it 
and 1 got me an airyplane, and 
that’s more’n they could do to me, 
by golly, they couldn’t kill me!” 
“Sure, Jim,” Ben said. 

“And when my time comes, I’ll 
be up and out o’ this chair. Man 
oughta fall and make a noise when 
he dies.” 

“Sure, Jim,” Ben said. “But 
that’s a long ways off, ain’t it?” 

Jim closed his eyes, and his face 
looked like a skull. “You squirts al- 
ways think a man lives forever.” 

F rom outside came the late 

morning sounds: the murmur- 
ing of Smoky Greek at the edge of 
town, under its cool tunnel of wil- 
lows; the twittering of a flock of 
robins circling above; the constant 
soft rustle of the trees that crowded 
the green hills around. From the 
warehouse down by the tracks came 
the faint sounds of livestock — and 
the voices of the men whose job it 
was to look after them this week : to 
feed them, turn them out into the 
big pens for an hour’s sunlight, 
then drive them bajk into the ware- 
house again. 

Lucky the warehouse had stood 
the bomb — it was perfect for the 
use. 

“Wonder how the war’s going,” 
Tom Pace said. He dropped some 
cards and bent painfully to retrieve 
them; his voice was muffled: “I 
just wonder how it’s going, you 
know? Wonder who’s killing more 
than who today. 

“Maybe,” Tom continued, com- 
ing up, “it’s all over. Ain’t seen no 
planes for couple years now. Maybe 

JEROME BIXBY 




somebody won.” 

Ben shrugged. “Who knows. 
Don’t matter none to us. We’re 
ready as we can be if another plane 
comes around. Other than that, it 
ain’t our concern.” 

“Darn tootin’,” Tom said, and 
pushed the cards together and 
started shuffling again. 

Jim Liddel said, “War!” and 
looked like he’d bit into spoiled 
meat. “Never settled nothing . 
just makes the biggest dog top-dog 
for a while, so he can get his way. 
Man, I wish I could still lift a rifle, 
if an airyplane come around! I’d 
love to get me another one.” He 
put his thin back against the cush- 
ions and pushed at the edge of the 
table with his hands. Jim’s fingers 
didn’t move so well any more ; some 
were curled and some were straight 
out, and the joints were different 
sizes, and now they were trembling 
a little. “Sometimes when I think 
o’ Johnny and Helen and all the 
kids — when I think o’ that day, and 
those damn bombs, and that white 
tower o’ smoke up over the town, I 
. oh, godamighty, I’d love to see 
another airyplane! I’d shout and 
yell and pray; I’d pray almighty 
God for you to get it!” 

Ben pulled on his cigar with stiff 
lips, and said slowly, “Well, we 
might, Jim. We just might. Two 
out o’ seven ain’t bad.” He puffed 
out smoke. “We been running in 
luck, so far, what with nobody ever 
coming back loaded for bear. Reck- 
on that means the other five didn’t 
see us, low as they was; probably 
didn’t even know they was being 
shot at.” 

“They musta found bulletholes, 
though,” Tom Pace said. “After- 
wards. Not a chance we’d all 



miss — ” he bobbed his beard at old 
Jim — “ ’specially with Dan’l Boone 
here plugging away. They’d know 
they was shot at, all right. Might 
even find rifle bullets.” 

“Maybe they did,” Ben said. 
“Nobody ever come snooping back, 
though.” 

“Wouldn’t know where to, would 
they?” Windy Harris said. He and 
Fat Sam Hogan had stopped play- 
ing checkers, and had been listen- 
ing. “Smoky Creek looks dead as 
Sodom. Buildings all down, and 
stuff knee-deep in the streets. 
Bridge down, and the road out. 
And the valley is way the hell out 
o’ the way ... no call for them to 
suspect it more’n anyplace else. 
Less, even. They’d likely figure 
somebody took a potshot from a 
hill . and there’s a pack o’ hills 
between here’n outside. 

“Looks like,” Ben said. “We just 
got to keep it that way. We got a 
good plan: if the plane’s up high, 
we just freeze under cover; if it 
comes down low a time or two, we 
figure we’re likely spotted and start 
shooting. We shoot, and maybe it 
shoots too, and we pray.” 

“It’s a good plan,” Jim Liddel 
said, looking out the window. “We 
got two.” 

Windy Harris got up and 
stretched out his arms. 

“Two ain’t enough/^ old Jim 
said bitterly. 

“Well,” Windy said, “I hope we 
keep on getting ’em — them as sees 
us, anyway. Hope nobody ever 
knows we’re here. It’s peaceful 
here. Way off by ourselves, nothing 
to do but get up and go to bed, 
and do what we want in between.” 
He sent tobacco juice into the cus- 
pidor by the door. “Right now, 

63 



OUR TOWN 




me, I guess I’ll go fishing down by 
the creek — promised Maude I’d 
bring home a cat or two for sup- 
per. Anybody come along?” 

Tom Pace shook his head, and 
old Jim looked like he’d like to 
go, if he only could — and Ben said, 
“Maybe I’ll be down a little while 
later. Windy. Keep to the trees.” 
Windy left, and Tom Pace shuf- 
fled the cards and looked over at 
Jim Liddel. “You going to play 
with Ben and me, you old wind- 
bag, or you going to keep bragging 
so loud a man can’t stand your 
company?” 

“Why, you whippersnapper,” 
Jim growled, “you just go ahead 
and run ’em. Reckon a reasoning 
man and a nitwit’s about the best 
I can do right now.” 

Tom dealt out two cards, and 
said, “War!” without dealing out 
the rest. He looked at Ben, his eyes 
cloudy. “Got a cigar, Ben?” 

Ben handed one over and held a 
match, and Tom got it going, puff- 
ing longer than he had to, like he 
didn’t want to talk yet. 

Then he said, “It didn’t have to 
happen.” He worked the cigar over 
to the corner of his mouth and set- 
tled it in the nest of stained whis- 
kers there. “None of it had to hap- 
pen — what happened here, and 
whatever happened outside the 
valley. It just didn’t have to hap- 
pen.” 

“ ’Course it didn’t,” Ben said. 
“Never has to. It just always does. 
Some people got reasons to let it 
happen, and some ain’t got the 
sense not to.” 

Fat Sam Hogan said, “I don’t 
figure there’s anything in the world 
a man can’t sit down and talk out, 
instead o’ reaching for a gun. Don’t 

64 



know why that oughtn’ta hold for 
countries.” 

Ben Bates looked at one of the 
two cards Tom Pace had dealt — 
his hole card. It was a four, and he 
lost interest. “Yup,” he said, “it 
holds all right . they’ll just both 
reach half the time anyway. One 
war on top of another. Even one 
right after this one, ten years or so, 
if this one’s over. I just bet. Every 
country wants a piece out o’ the 
next one’s hide — or his poke — and 
they won’t give an inch except in 
talk ; they won’t really buckle down 
to stop a war. Never. Not if they 
can’t get what they want by talk.” 
He looked at the card again, just in 
case — a four, sure enough. “Only 
time there’s never a war is when 
everybody has what they want, or 
figure they can get it without kill- 
ing somebody. But the second they 
see that’s the only way, then it’s 
war. War, war, war. It’s a rotten 
way to run a world, killing to de- 
cide who’s right or wrong . 
’specially killing people who got 
damn little say about it. But I seen 
three-four wars now, and they don’t 
look to stop soon, judging.” He 
shook his head wonderingly. “Put 
half the money they spend on kill- 
ing toward curing, instead, and 
helping them that wants, and find- 
ing out all about diseases and such 
. why, shucks, it’d be a brand- 
new world.” 

“I seen five,” Jim Liddel said. “I 
seen wars come and go. I fought 
in one. Afterwards, every time, they 
say everything’s fine. The war to 
save this or that’s over, and things 
are fine. Then somebody wants 
something somebody else has, and 
they’re at it again, like two bulls 
trying to hump the same heifer. 

JEROME BIXBY 




Bulls don’t have enough sense to 
know there’s enough cows to go 
around; but people ought. It’s a 
big enough world.” He worked 
those hands of his together until 
they were clasped, and he pushed 
them that way against the table- 
edge until the overgrown knuckles 
looked like chalk. “When I think o’ 
that noise, and that cloud, . how 
we come running and screaming 
back here into all the dust and 
mess, and all them bodies . I . 
Ben, I . .” 

“You lost heavy, Jim,” Ben said. 
He let smoke out of his lungs, and 
it curled off into the broad beam 
of sunlight that came through the 
window, and it looked like the 
smoke that had shadowed a mur- 
dered town. “Heavy. You lost 
heavier’n any of us.” 

“You can’t count it,” old Jim 
said, and the chalk was whiter. 
“We all lost the same; I just had 
more of it. Our kids and their kids 
— and their kids . lost heavy? 
What can a man lose more’n his 
life? . And if you’re as old as us, 
what’s your life except the family 
you made out o’ your own flesh? 
What else’s a man got when he’s 
eighty or a hundred?” 

Tom Pace said, “Ruth and Dave 
and their kids. I remember little 
Davey. He called me Tom Peach. 
I bought him a toy plane for his 
birthday. That was a couple days 
before the real planes come. I 
buried it with him ... I think. I 
think it was him I put it with. It 
mighta been Joey . they looked 
alike.” 

“A man ain’t nothing, when he’s 
as old as us,” Jim Liddel said, his 
skull sockets closed, “except what 
he done. He ain’t much any more, 

OUR TOWN 



himself; he’s mostly what he done 
with his life, whatever he done and 
left around that he can point to 
and say, ‘I did that’, that’s all. And 
what’s he got left if they take that 
away? We can’t make it again. We 
made Smoky Greek; built it; wasn’t 
a thing here that didn’t come out 
o’ us or ours. We made the valley, 
after God give it to us; wasn’t a 
thing here we didn’t let live or help 
live or make live. We made our 
families, and watched ’em fit into 
the town and the valley, like the 
valley fits into the world, and we 
watched ’em go on doing what we 
done before them: building and 
working and planting and raising 
families — going on, like people got 
to go on. That’s the way it was. 
That’s what we had. Until they 
dropped the bomb and killed it — 
killed all we done that made us 
men.” Tears were squeezing out of 
the skull sockets, and Ben Bates 
caught Tom Pace’s eye and looked 
away, out the window, at the green 
walls of the valley that was a coffin. 

“I just wish an airyplane would 
come around again,” old Jim said. 
“/ — just — wish. You know, Ben?” 

Ben tried to talk and had to clear 
his throat; he put out his cigar in 
the ashtray, as if that was what was 
wrong with his throat, and said, “I 
know, Jim. Sure. And maybe you’ll 
get your wish.” He pushed back 
his chair and tried to grin, but it 
came out sour. “Maybe you will, 
you old fire-eater — and what if one 
comes and we get spotted and it 
shoots us up or goes back and tells 
everybody we’re here? That’s one 
wish we don’t want the good Lord 
to grant, ain’t it? Ain’t it, now?” 

Jim didn’t say anything. 

Ben got up and said, “ ’Bout 

65 




noon. Guess I’ll go home for a bite 
and then go down and fish with 
Windy.” 

Jim said, thinly, “I meant, I wish 
one would come and we’d get it.” 

“Well, maybe one will,” Ben 
said, turning toward the door. 
“They built a slew o’ them. And 
maybe we will, if it does.” 



Et STOPPED by the door of 
the Town Hall to listen care- 
fully, his sharp old eyes half-shut. 
Behind him, at the far end of the 
room, somebody made a ringer, 
and Dave Mason said, “Nice, 
Owen,” in his reedy voice. Ben lis- 
tened and didn’t hear what he was 
listening for. He stepped past the 
rifle that leaned beside the door 
and made his way to the end of 
the porch, walking close to the wall. 
The summer sun stood at noon, and 
the porch was in shadow; beyond, 
the street was a jumble of boards 
and broken glass, its canyon walls 
of leaning building-fronts and sag- 
ging porches, its caverns of empty 
windows and doorways shimmer- 
ing in the heat. You couldn’t see 
much dirt along the way; where 
the debris didn’t come to your 
knees, it reached over your head. 

At the end of the porch Ben 
stopped and listened again; heard 
nothing. He stepped down and 
walked as fast as he could — damn 
arthritis again — to the porch of the 
next building. 

This had been Fat Sam Hogan’s 
Hardware Store, and about all that 
was left of it was the porch; the 
rest was a twisted mess of wood 
that slumped away to the ground 
at the rear. The porch had been 
down too, right after the bombing 

66 



— ^but the old men, working at 
night, had raised it and braced it 
up. Something to walk under. 

A Springfield stood, oiled and 
waiting, against the wall. Ben 
paused and touched the barrel — it 
was his own. Or rather it had once 
been his own ; now it was the 
town’s, strictly speaking, to be used 
by whoever was nearest it when the 
time came. It was a good gun, a 
straight-shooter, one of the best — 
which was why it was here instead 
of at his house. A man could get 
a better shot from here. 

He went on, hugging the wall. 

He passed a rifle wedged up be- 
tween the fender and hood of Norm 
Henley’s old Model A, and he re- 
membered how the bomb had 
flipped the car right over on its 
top, and how the car must have 
protected Norm from the blast — 
just a little. Enough so they found 
him two blocks up the street, in 
front of his mashed house, trailing 
blood from every hole in him, to 
get to his family before he died. 

Ben passed rifles leaned against 
walls and chairs on porches, rifles 
standing behind trees, leaned in the 
cracks between what buildings still 
stood to provide cracks, even old 
Jim’s carbine lying under the ledge 
of the pump-trough in front of Ma- 
son’s General Store. All of them in 
places where they were protected 
from rain or snow, but where they 
were easy to get at. 

He passed sixteen rifles — walk- 
ing, as everybody walked when 
they were out of doors, as close to 
the walls of the buildings as pos- 
sible. When you had to cross open 
spaces you ran as fast as your sev- 
enty or eighty year old legs would 
take you — and if you couldn’t run, 

JEROME BIXBY 





you walked real fast. And always 
you listened while you walked ; par- 
ticularly you listened before you 
went out. For planes. So you 
wouldn’t be spotted from the air. 

At the end of the porch of the 
last building on the street, Ben 
paused in the shade and looked out 
across the creek to where the first 
plane they’d shot down had 
crashed — the one Jim claimed to 
have got by his lonesome. They’d 
buried what they found of the pi- 
lot, and cleared away every last bolt 
and nut and scrap of aluminum, 
but the long scar in the ground re- 
mained. Ben looked at it, all brok- 
en up by rocks and flowers and 
bushes the old people had trans- 
planted so it wouldn’t show from 
the air; and he looked at the cem- 
etery a hundred feet beyond at 
which the scar pointed like an ar- 
row — ^the cemetery that wasn’t a 
cemetery, because it didn’t have 
headstones; just bodies. A town 
that was dead shouldn’t have a lot 
of new graves — the dead don’t bury 
themselves. A pilot might see a 
hundred graves he hadn’t seen be- 
fore and wonder — and strafe. 

So Ben looked at the flat ground 
where those hundred bodies lay, 
with only small rocks the size of a 
man’s fist with names scratched on 
them to mark who lay beneath; 
and he thought of his daughter 
May, and Owen Urey’s son George 
who’d married May, and their 
three kids, and he remembered 
burying them there; he remem- 
bered their faces. The blood from 
eyes, nose, ears, mouth — his blood 
it was, part of it. 

Then Ben looked up. “We ain’t 
looking for trouble,” he said to the 
empty blue bowl of sky. “But if you 

OUR TOWN 



do come, we’re ready. Every day 
we’re ready. If you stay up high, 
we’ll hide. But if you come down 
low, we’ll try to get you, you crazy 
murderers.” 



H rS HOUSE was only a few 
yards farther on; he got there 
by sticking under the trees, walking 
quickly from one to the next, his 
ears cocked for the jetsound that 
would flatten him against a trunk. 
Way off to his left, across a long flat 
of sunflowers and goldenrod, he 
saw Windy Harris down on the 
creekbank, by the bridge. He yelled, 
“They biting?” — and Windy’s faint 
“Got two!” reminded him of all old 
Jim had said, and he shook his 
head. He left the trees and walked 
fast up his front path. 

His house was in pretty good 
shape. All four houses on the out- 
skirts had come off standing — his 
and Windy’s and Jim’s and Owen 
Urey’s. They’d needed just a little 
bracing here and there, and they 
were fine — except Owen’s. Owen 
had stomped around in his, and lis- 
tened to the sounds of it, and said 
he didn’t trust it — and sure enough, 
the first big storm it had gone 
down. 

Now Ben and his wife Susan 
lived downstairs in his house; Joe 
Kincaid and his wife Anna lived 
on the second floor; and Tom Pace 
lived in the attic, claiming that 
climbing the stairs was good for his 
innards. 

Anna Kincaid was sitting on the 
porch-swing, peeling potatoes. Ben 
said, “Afternoon, Anna,” and saw 
her pale bright eyes flicker up at 
him, and that scared smile touched 
her mouth for just a second; then 

67 




she hunched her shoulders and kept 
on with the potatoes, like he wasn’t 
even there. 

Ben thought, It must be lonely 
to he that way — and he attracted 
her attention again, his voice a lit- 
tle louder: “Hope you’re feeling 
fine, Anna.” 

Again the flicker of eyes. “Just 
fine, Ben, thanks,” she said, almost 
in a whisper. “Peeling spuds.” 

“I see.” 

Her knife sped over a potato, re- 
moving a spiral of skin. She 
popped out an eye with a twist of 
the point. “Think Keith’ll be back 
from the war today, Ben? It’s been 
so long ... I hate to think o’ my 
boy fighting out there so long. Will 
they let him come home soon, 
Ben?” 

“They will, Anna. I think they 
will, real soon. Maybe tomorrow.” 

“ITi// they?^^ 

“Sure.” 

Keith Kincaid was under one of 
those fist-sized rocks, out in the 
cemetery that wasn’t a cemetery — 
next to his wife, June Hogan, and 
their four kids. But Anna Kincaid 
didn’t know that. Since the bomb, 
Anna hadn’t known much of any- 
thing except what the old people 
told her, and they told her only 
things that would make her as hap- 
py as she could be: that Keith was 
in the Army, and June was off with 
the kids having a nice time in 
Knoxville; and that they’d all be 
back home in a day or so. 

Anna never wondered about 
that “day or so” — she didn’t re- 
member much from day to day. 
Joe Kincaid sometimes said that 
helped a little, as much as anything 
could. He could tell her the same 
nice things every day, and her eyes 

68 



would light up all over again. He 
spent a lot of time with her, doing 
that. He was pretty good at it, too 
. Joe Kincaid had been Doctor 
Joe before the bomb. He still doc- 
tored some, when he could, but he 
was almost out of supplies; and 
what with his patients being so old, 
he mostly just prayed for them. 

In the kitchen, Susan had lunch 
ready and waiting — some chicken 
from last night, green beans, boiled 
potatoes and a salad from the tiny 
gardens the women tended off in 
the weedy ground and around the 
bases of trees where they wouldn’t 
be seen. 

On the way in Ben had noticed 
that the woodbox was about empty 
— he’d have to bring home another 
bag of charcoal from the “general 
store” — which was Windy’s barn, 
all braced up. Into it the old peo- 
ple had taken every bit of clothing, 
canned food, hardware, anything 
at all they could use in the way of 
housekeeping and everyday living, 
and there it all stood; when some- 
body needed something, they went 
and took it. Only the canned foods 
and tobacco and liquor were ra- 
tioned. Every week or so, around 
midnight. Fat Sam Hogan and Dan 
Paray went into the big cave in 
Lawson’s Hill, right near where the 
second plane had crashed, and set 
up a lot of small fires, back where 
the light wouldn’t be seen; they 
made charcoal, and when it cooled 
they brought it down to the “store,” 
for cooking and such — a charcoal 
fire doesn’t give off much smoke. 

Over coffee, Ben said, “Reckon 
I’ll fish some this afternoon, honey. 
How’s a cat or two for supper 
sound?” 

“Why, goodness, Ben, not for to- 
JEROME BIXBY 




night,” Susan smiled. “You know 
tonight’s the Social; me and Anna 
are fixing a big dinner — steaks and 
all the trimmings.” 

“Mm,” Ben said, draining his 
cup. “Forgot today was Sunday.” 
“We’re going to have some 
music, and Owen Urey’s going to 
read Shakespeare.” 

Ben pursed his lips, tasting the 
coffee. It was rationed to two cups 
a day; he always took his with his 
lunch, and sometimes he’d have 
sold a leg to dive into a full pot. 
“Well ... I might as well fish any- 
way; take in some fun. Fish’ll keep 
till tomorrow, won’t it?” 

“You can have it for breakfast.” 
She sat down across the table and 
picked up the knitting she’d been 
on when Ben came home; he had 
a hunch it was something for his 
birthday, so he tried not to look in- 
terested; too early to tell what it 
was, anyway. “Ben,” she said, “be- 
fore you go — the curtain pole in 
the bay window come down when 
I was fixing the blankets over it for 
tonight. The socket’s loose. You 
better fix it before you go. You’ll 
maybe get home after Anna and 
me want to light the lamps, and we 
can’t do it till it’s fixed.” 

Ben said, “Sure, hon.” He got 
the hammer and some nails from 
the toolbox and went into the par- 
lor, and dragged the piano bench 
over in front of the bay window. 
The iron rod was leaning by the 
phonograph. He took it up with 
him on the chair and fitted the 
other end of it into the far socket, 
then fitted the near end into the 
loose socket, and drove nails around 
the base of the socket until the 
thing was solid as a rock. Then he 
got the blanket from the couch and 

OUR TOWN 



hung it down double over the rod, 
and fitted the buttonholes sewn all 
along its edge over the nails driven 
around the window casing, and 
patted it here and there until not 
a speck of light would escape when 
the lamps were lit. 

He inspected the blankets draped 
over the other windows; they were 
all right. The parlor was pretty 
dark now, so he struck a match to 
the oil lamp on the mantle, just so 
Susan and Anna could see to set 
the table. When the others arrived, 
they’d light the other lamps; but 
not until; oil was precious. The 
only time anybody in town ever lit 
a lamp was on Social night: then 
the old people stayed up till around 
midnight for eats and entertain- 
ment; otherwise everybody got to 
bed at eight or so, and climbed out 
with the dawn. 

He went back into the kitchen 
and put away the hammer, and 
said, “My second cup still hot, 
honey?” 

She started to put down her knit- 
ting and get up, and he said, “Just 
asking,” and pressed her shoulder 
till she sat again. He went around 
her and filled his cup at the stove. 

“Ben,” she said, when he sat 
down again, “I wish you’d take a 
look at the phonograph too. Last 
time the turntable made an awful 
lot of noise. ... I wish it could 
sound better for tonight.” 

“I know, honey,” Ben sighed. 
“That motor’s going. There ain’t 
much I can do about it, though. 
It’s too old. I’m scared to take it 
apart; might not get it back to- 
gether right. When it really quits, 
then I guess I’ll fool around and 
see what I can do. Heck, it didn’t 
sound too bad.” 



69 




“It rattled during the soft parts 
of the music.” 

Ben shook his head. “If I try, I 
might ruin it for good.” He smiled 
a little. “It’s like us, Suse — too old 
to really fix up much; just got to 
keep cranking it, and let it go 
downhill at its own pace.” 

Susan folded her knitting and got 
up. She came around the table, 
and he put an arm around her 
waist and pulled her into the chair 
beside him. 

“It’ll go soon, won’t it, Ben?” she 
said softly. “Then we won’t have 
any music. It’s a shame ... we all 
like to listen so much. It’s peace- 
ful.” 

“I know.” He moved his arm up 
and squeezed her thin shoulders. 
She put her head on his shoulder, 
and her grey hair tickled his cheek ; 
he closed his eyes, and her hair was 
black and shining again, and he 
put his lips against it and thought 
he smelled a perfume they didn’t 
even make any more. 

After a moment he said, “We 
got so much else, though, Suse . 
we got peaceful music you can’t 
play on a machine. Real peace. A 
funny kind of peace. In a funny- 
looking town, this one — a rag town. 
But it’s ours, and it’s quiet, and 
there’s nothing to bother us — and 
just pray God we can keep it that 
way. Outside, the war’s going on 
someplace, probably. People fight- 
ing each other over God knows 
what — ^if even He knows. Here, it’s 
peaceful.” 

She moved her head on his shoul- 
der. “Ben — will it ever come here, 
what’s going on outside? Even the 
war, if it’s still going on?” 

“Well, we were talking about 
that this morning down at the hall, 

70 



Suse. I guess it won’t. If rifles can 
stop it, it won’t. If they see us from 
the air, we’ll shoot at ’em; and if 
we get ’em we’ll clean up the mess 
so if anybody comes looking for a 
missing plane, they won’t give 
Smoky Creek a second look. That’s 
the only way anything can come, 
honey — if they see us from the air. 
Nobody’s going to come hiking over 
these mountains. There’s noplace 
they’d want to get to, and it’s sure 
no country for fighting.” 

“If the war is over, they’ll likely 
be around to fix up the bridge and 
the road. Won’t they?” 

“Maybe so. Sooner or later.” 
“Oh, I hope they leave us alone.” 
“Don’t worry, hon.” 

“Ben — about the phonograph — ” 
“Suse . .” He turned his head 
to look at her eyes. “It’s good for 
longer’n we are. That motor. So’s 
the bridge, the way it is, and the 
road . we’ll be gone first. Before 
they get around to fix ’em. Before 
the phonograph gives out. What 
we want is going to last us — and 
what we don’t want will come too 
late to hurt us. Nothing's going to 
hurt our peace. I know that some- 
how. We got it, and it’ll be like 
this for as long as we’re here to en- 
joy it ... I know/^ 

“Ben—” 

“If I want to go fishing,” Ben 
said, and pressed her head against 
his shoulder again, “I go. If I want 
to relax with the men, I do it. If I 
want to just walk and breathe deep, 
I do it — keeping to the trees, o’ 
course. If I want to just be with 
you, I do it. It’s quiet. It’s real quiet 
in our rag town. It’s a world for 
old people. It’s just the way we 
want it, to live like we want to live. 
We got enough gardens and live- 

JEROME BIXBY 




stockj and all the canned stuff in 
the store, to last us for a . for as 
long as we got. And no worries. 
About who’s fighting who over 
what. About who won. About how 
the international mess is getting 
worse again, and we better make 
more bombs for the next one. 
About who’s winning here and los- 
ing there and running neck-and- 
neck someplace else. We don’t 
know any things like that, and we 
don’t want to know. It don’t mat- 
ter none to us . we’re too old, 
and we seen too much of it, and it’s 
hurt us too bad, and we know it 
just don’t matter at all.” 

“Ben ... I got to crying today. 
About May and George and the 
children. I was crying, and think- 
ing about that day . 

“So did I think. None of us ever 
forgets for a minute. For a second.” 
His lips thinned. “That’s part of 
why we do what we do. Rest is, we 
just want to be left alone.” 

They sat in silence for a moment, 
his arm around her shoulders, his 
other hand holding hers. Then he 
released her hand and thumped his 
own on the table, grinned at her 
and said, “Life goes on, now! Reck- 
on I’ll go down and get that cat — 
or go walking — or just go soak in 
some sun. What time are the folks 
showing up for — ” 

Jetsound slammed across the 
peaceful valley. 

B en got up and walked as fast 
as he could to the door, picked 
up the rifle leaning there, cocked it. 
Looking toward town he saw that 
Tom Pace had been on his way 
home, and the sound had caught 
him between trees. Tom hesitated, 

OUR TOWN 



then turned and dived toward the 
tree he’d just left — because a rifle 
was there, 

Ben saw men pour out of the 
doorways of the two habitable 
buildings on Main Street ; they 
stuck close to the walls, under the 
porches, and they picked up rifles. 

Motionless, hidden, in shadows, 
under trees, in doorways, behind 
knotholes, they waited. To see if 
the plane would buzz the town 
again. 

It did. 

It came down low over Main 
Street while the thunders of its first 
pass still echoed and rolled. Fright- 
ening birds out of trees, driving a 
hare frantically along the creek- 
bank, blotting out the murmur of 
the creek and the tree-sounds, driv- 
ing away peace. 

They saw the pilot peering 
through the plexiglass, down at the 
buildings ... he was past the town 
in four winks ; but in two they knew 
that he was curious, and would 
probably come back for a third 
look. 

He circled wide off over the end 
of the valley, a vertical bank that 
brought a blinding flash of sunlight 
from one wing, and he came back. 

Ben leveled his rifle and centered 
the nose of the plane in his sights. 
For some reason — probably because 
the valley walls crowded the town 
on both sides — the planes always 
lined up with Main Street when 
they flew low over the town. 

The plane grew at startling 
speed in Ben’s sights — it loomed, 
and the oval jet intake was a growl- 
ing mouth — and he waited till it 
was about two seconds and a thou- 
sand feet from him; then he sent 
his bullet up into that mouth: a 

71 




bullet aimed by a man who’d han- 
dled a rifle for sixty years, who 
could pop the head off a squirrel 
at a hundred feet. A running squir- 
rel. 

That was the signal, Ben’s shot. 

From under the tree Tom Pace’s 
rifle spoke. 

The jet was past town then, and 
he wheeled to follow it with his 
eyes; its whining thunder lashed 
down and pressed his ears, lower- 
ing suddenly in pitch as it receded ; 
and though he couldn’t hear them 
for the thunder, he knew that nine- 
teen rifles had roared before it 
completed its turn, each aimed 
head-on at the plane. Aimed by 
men and women who could shoot 
with Ben, and even outshoot him. 

The plane coughed. Lurched. It 
had time to emit a fuzzy thread of 
black smoke before it nosed down 
and melted into the ground and 
became a long ugly smear of 
mounds and shreds and tatters of 
flame. 

The sounds of the crash died. 
Ben heard men shouting; loudest 
of all was old Jim Liddel’s, “Got 
him ... by God, I prayed, and we 
got him!” 

Behind him Susan was crying. 

Ben saw men and women head 
for the crash-site; immediately 
they’d start to carry away what de- 
bris wasn’t too hot to handle. Then 
they’d wait, and as soon as any- 
thing was cool enough it would be 
carried off and hidden. 

And there’d be a burial tonight. 

Ben saw that some of the men 
had carried old Jim’s chair out onto 
the porch of the Town Hall; and 
he saw that Jim was half-standing 
out of his cushions, propped up on 
•his fists and still shouting; and Ben 

72 



wondered if the Maker wasn’t on 
the porch there with Jim, waiting 
for Jim to fall and make his noise. 

He turned away — at seventy you 
don’t want to see a man die — and 
went inside and put his rifle on the 
kitchen table. He crossed to the 
cabinet under the sink to get his 
reamer and oiling rag. Every rifle 
was taken care of that way. Right 
now Tom Pace and Dan Paray 
were hurrying around gathering 
rifles to clean them, load them. No 
rifle must miss fire, or throw a bul- 
let an inch off aim — because that 
might be the rifle whose aim was 
right. 

“Lucky we got that one,” he 
said. “I think he saw us, Suse . 
he come in low and sudden, and I 
think he saw us.” 

“Was — was it one of theirs, Ben 
. or one of ours?” 

“Don’t know. I didn’t even look. 
I can’t tell ’em apart. Owen’ll be 
around to tell me when they find 
out . but I reckon it was one of 
ours. If he saw us and didn’t shoot, 
then I reckon it was one of ours. 
Like the last one.” 

“Oh, Ben'^ Susan said. “Ben, 
ain’t it against God?” 

Ben stood looking out the win- 
dow over the sink ; watching a 
cloud of yellow dust settle over the 
wreckage of the plane, and a 
cloud of black smoke rising from 
the wreckage to darken the yellow. 
He knew some of the men would be 
passing buckets from the well, and 
spading dirt on the flames where 
they weren’t too hot to get to. 

“That’s the way it is,” he said. 
“That’s how we decided. God 
didn’t stop the bomb dropping, 
Suse . for whatever reasons He 



JEROME BIXBY 




had. It don’t seem He’d deny us 
the right to shoot rifles, for the rea- 
sons we got. If we get turned away 
at the Gates, we’ll know we was 
wrong. But I don’t think so.” 

Quiet was returning to the val- 
ley; the birds had already started 
singing again. You could hear the 
trees. From the direction of the 
creek came Windy Harris, running, 
and he broke the quiet with a shout 
as he saw Ben by the window: “Got 
it, huh, Ben?” 

“Sure did,” Ben said, and Windy 
ran on. 

Ben looked toward the porch of 
the Town Hall. Old Jim had sunk 
back into his pillowed chair, and 
he was shaking his fist, and Ben 
could hear him yelling, “Got it . 
got it, we did!” 

He^ll be around for a while yet, 
old Jim, Ben thought, and turned 
back to the table. He sat down and 



listened to the sounds of the val- 
ley, and his eyes were the eyes of 
the valley — they’d seen a lot, and 
understood enough of it. 

“It don’t matter whose it was,” 
he said. “All of a cloth.” He slid 
the reamer into the barrel of the 
rifle, and worked it. “The hell with 
the war. Even if it’s over, the hell 
with it. With any war. Nothing’s 
ever going to give us back what we 
lost. Let ’em stay away, all them 
that’s to blame. Them and their 
planes and wars and bombs . 
they’re crazy!” His lips curled as 
he worked the reamer. “Let ’em 
stay out o’ what they left us for 
lives. Don’t want to hear what 
they’re doing, or how, or why, or 
who . don’t want to hear about 
it. It’d be crazy. The hell with ’em. 
All o’ them. The hell with the 
whole Twentieth Century”

to rebuild the life many of you may 
remember. It will be difficult at 
first. But time will teach us many 
things. Each of us has something 
to give the other. Go home now, 
and tomorrow we will begin again 
to find the dreams we first dreamed 
when we built Dreamtown.” 

The people sat in stunned silence 
for a moment. Then a cheer, lonely 
and overloud in the silence, went 
up from a man in the crowd. A 
woman ran from the crowd and 
seized a child from the group stand- 
ing huddled to one side of the 
Playground square. The woman 
was followed by two other women 
who did the same thing, and soon 

OUR TOWN 



the silence was broken by the loud 
and excited talking of the great 
crowd of people. 

“So much will have to be taught 
to these people,” Professor Corbett 
whispered as he watched the people 
file out of the Playground. 

Dan held Nancy in his arms as 
he spoke. “We must teach them to 
hold elections instead of blindly 
following self appointed leaders.” 
“We’ll build schools and publish- 
ing houses again,” Professor Cor- 
bett said happily. 

“And baseball diamonds and 
football fields.” 

“There’s such a long way to go.” 
“We’ll begin tomorrow.”

It was part of a picture in part of a building that had 
once been the Louvre. And somewhere back in his lost 
memory, it was also a name for “Whitey” . 

THE LAST CRUSADE 

BY GEORGE H. SMITH 



74 



Illustrated by Ed Emsh 





ULIUS CAESAR named this 
place ‘Lutetia Parisiorum’, 
which means ‘the mud town of the 
Parissii’, Later on people got around 
to calling it ‘the city of light/ ” 
Marty Coleman was saying. 

“Well, Julius was sure as hell a 
lot closer to the truth than those 
others,” I tell him. We was sitting 
in the mud in what’s left of some 
big building and me and Joe White 
was listening to Marty, our Ser- 
geant, talking like he always does. 
When I says the sergeant was talk- 
ing I mean he was talking over the 
C.C., the Company Communica- 
tion Circuit because what with hav- 
ing our mecho-armor on and the 
other side raising a little hell, we 
couldn’t of heard him any other 
way. 

“Yeah, I guess you’re right, 
Ward. There isn’t much light 
around here anymore,” Coleman 
admitted. 

“The only light you ever see 
around here these days is a flare or 
a rocket going over,” White says in 
that funny flat voice of his. 

From time to time Coleman 
would lift the headpiece of his 
armor above the pile of rubble in 
front of us and take a quick look 
out over the big open square to- 
ward where the enemy was holed 
up on the other side. About half 
the time he’d draw small arm or 
automatic fire. 

“Those birds must have infra- 
red eyepieces too,” he says as he 
sets down. 

“Ah they ain’t even got mecho- 
armor,” I says. 

“No, but they have body armor 
and helmets with quite a bit of stuff 
in them.” 

“I’ll bet they ain’t got anything 



like we got.” I was feeling pretty 
fine right then thinking how much 
better off we was than the poor 
joes in the infantry. We don’t just 
fight in our suits, we live in ’em. 
They ain’t only a mechanized suit 
of armor, they’re our barracks, 
messroom and latrine and all radia- 
tion and rain proof. We got more 
fire power than a company of in- 
fantry and more radio equipment 
than a tank. 

“You know there’s lots worse 
ways of fighting a war,” I says. 
“You climb into one of these babies 
and they seal you up like a sardine 
but at least you’re warm and dry 
and you don’t even have to use your 
own feet to walk. You got a nice 
little atomic power pack to move 
you around.” 

“You couldn’t move the legs of 
one of these things if you had to,” 
the Sergeant says. 

“It ... it just seems like a kind 
of funny way to fight a war,” White 
says, talking like he always did, as 
though he had to hunt for every 
word before he said it. 

“What’s funny about it? They 
been fighting it this way for ten 
years, haven’t they?” I demands. 

“I guess so ... I don’t know . 

“Yeah, ten years. And the last 
five of it we’ve spent crawling back 
and forth in what used to be Paris,” 
the sergeant was talking again. 
“Just think ... in the old wars they 
used to call it Gay Paree.” 

“It’s gay all right,” I says, fol- 
lowing a movement on my ground 
radar screen. A beep had shown up, 
indicating activity over where the 
enemy was. Their guns was silent 
now but across the mud pools came 
their voices, voices that from time 
to time cut in on our circuits and 



75 




competed with the voices of our 
own side. 

Suddenly a girl was talking, a 
girl with a soft voice that was like 
warm lips against your ear. “Hello 
there, you fellows across the line. 
It’s not much fun being here is it? 
Especially when you know that 
some non-draft back in the home- 
town walked off with your girl a 
long time ago. 

“Honey Chile,” the voice went 
on, “this is your old gal, Sally May, 
and I know how you all feel ’cause 
I used to be on the same side my- 
self until I found out how things 
are over here in the Peoples Federal 
Democratic Eastern Republics . .” 
The bleat of a code message cut 
through the syrupy tones, tore at 
our ears for a few moments and 
faded away. Slowly the sweet voice 
drifted back. 

“Well, fellows, we’re gonna play 
you some real homey music in a 
few minutes, but first we’re gonna 
tell you all about our contest. We 
know you all Yankee boys like con- 
tests and this one is a real hum- 
dinger. 

“This here contest is open to 
every GI over there in the mecho- 
units. And have we got prizes? 
why, honey, we sure have! Listen 
to this big first prize: $100,000 
dollars in gold! And then we have 
an expense paid vacation in the 
scenic Crimea and a brand new 
factory special Stalin sportscar. And 
fellows, get this : A TV appearance 
on a nationwide hookup with a 
dinner date afterwards with gla- 
morous Sonia Nickolovich, the fa- 
mous ballerina. 

“Now I guess you boys are won- 
derin’ what you gotta do to win 
these wonderful prizes. Well, this 

76 



is how easy it is. All you gotta do 
is write out a thousand word state- 
ment on ‘How my mecho-armor 
works’ and deliver it along with 
your armor to the nearest P.F.D.- 
E.R. army unit. Now . isn’t that 
easy? And this contest is open to 
everyone but agents of the P.F.D.- 
E.R. and their relatives.” 

The soft voice faded away. 
“Why . the dirty — What do 
they think we are?” 

Just on general principles I sent 
a half-dozen 75 mm shells in the 
direction of their lines. 

“I don’t — think I — understand 
that at all. What are they trying 
to do?” White asks. “I thought the 
enemy was Reds.” 

“You’re in pretty bad shape, ain’t 
you buddy?” I laughs. “Can’t you 
even remember who you’re fight- 
ing?” 

“Leave him alone, will you. 
Ward,” the sergeant orders. “If you 
had been brain washed as many 
times as he has you’d have trouble 
remembering things too.” 

“Whatta ya mean?” 

Sarge swung the big headpiece 
of his armor around and looked at 
White through his electric eyes. 
“How many times you been cap- 
tured, Whitey?” he asks. 

“I ... I don’t know, Sarge. I 
don’t remember. Twice ... I 
guess.” 

“That’s two brain washings from 
the enemy and two rewashings from 
our own psycho units. Four elec- 
tronic brain washings don’t leave 
much in a man’s brain.” 

“Well, I’ll be damned. Which 
side was you on first, Whitey?” I 
asks. 

“I don’t know ... I don’t re- 
member.” 



GEORGE H. SMITH 




*‘Ah come on now, you must 
know. Was you a Russian or an 
American? Western Democratic 
Peoples Federal Republics or Peo- 
ples Federal Democratic Eastern 
Republics — which side?” 

“I . don’t know. All I know is 
that they ain’t good and we got to 
fight them until we kill all of them.” 

“How do you know they ain’t 
good?” I demands. “If you don’t 
know which side you was on to 
start with, maybe you was shootin’ 
at your own brothers this morning 
. or your mother.” 

“You better watch your mouth. 
Ward. There might be a Loyalty 
Officer tuned in on the band. You 
wouldn’t want a probe, would 
you?” Coleman asks. 

“Ah, they ain’t listenin’, Sarge. 
This guy gives me the willies. He 
don’t know nothin’ but how to run 
that damn armor and how to fight. 
He don’t even know who he was 
to start with.” 

“I wish I did know ... I wish 

I . .” 

“You know, Whitey, maybe you 
was a big shot on the other side. 
Maybe you was Joe Stalin’s grand- 
son or something. 

Remember!'' an eager voice 
whispered in our ears. ^'Remember 
what you are fighting for. In the 
WDPFR there are more washing 
machines than in any place else 
in the world!" 

I had to laugh. “You ever seen 
a washing machine, Sarge?” I asks. 

Coleman was looking back to- 
ward our lines. “Yeah. There used 
to be a place called Brooklyn that 
was full of ’em. You know, there’s 
something going on back there. The 
whole company seems to be mov- 
ing up. And there’s a big armored 

THE LAST CRUSADE 



crawler there with a smaller one 
parked beside it.” 

He sits back down with a clank- 
ing of armor. “Must be some big 
shots coming around to see how 
we’re winning the war.” 

“I wish someone would use a 
can opener on me right now and 
take me out of this walking sardine 
can and plump me into a washing 
machine. I ain’t been clean in five 
years,” I says. 

“Do they have washing machines 
on the other side?” Whitey wants 
to know. 

“Naw. They ain’t got nothin’ like 
that, nothin’ at all,” I tells him. 
“Things like washing machines is 
reserved for us capitalists.” 

“If we got washing machines and 
they ain’t, then what are we fight- 
ing for?” Whitey asks. 

“You better ask the Sarge that. 
He’s the intellectual around here. 
He reads all the comic books and 
things.” 

“Why do you think we’re fight- 
ing, Whitey?” Coleman asks. 

“Well, Sarge ... I don’t know. If 
I could just remember who I used 
to be, I’d know. Sometime I’m 
gonna remember. Every once in a 
while I can almost . but then I 
don’t.” 

“Well, why do you think we’re 
fighting?” I asks. 

“Well . well ... I guess it’s 
that there’s bad guys and good guys 
, . just like in the comics or on 
the TV shows. We’re the good guys 
and they’re the bad guys. Is that 
right, Sarge?” 

“I don’t know, Whitey. That 
might be some of it but I kinda 
think that maybe it has something 
to do with when we won the last 
war or thought we won it. We 



77 




thought we had finished with the 
Nazi’s but I guess maybe we got 
fooled. In Europe the Nazi’s all 
turned Communist and in America 
the Commies all turned Nazi. 
Either way people like them have 
always got the jump on the joes in 
between. In Europe they pointed at 
them and called them Nazi’s. In 
America they pointed at them and 
called them Reds. Pretty soon peo- 
ple didn’t know the difference, ex- 
cept that it was better to be point- 
ing than to be pointed at.” 

“Now, Sarge, you’re the one that 
better careful. You wouldn’t 
want the Loyalty Officer to be hear- 
ing that sort of talk, would you?” I 
cuts in. 

“Maybe you’re right but I kinda 
think that that’s why , . .” 



UST THEN the command cir- 
cuit in our helmets opened up 
with orders for us to pull back and 
join the rest of the company. All 
the way back Whitey doesn’t say 
anything so I figure he’s trying to 
remember who he is. Well, we gets 
back to the command post without 
drawing more than a little small 
arms fire and a couple of rockets, 
but things is really popping there. 
The big crawler Coleman seen 
from our outpost is settin’ there in 
the middle of the street and the 
whole company is gathered around 
it. 

“What’s goin’ on?” I say as I 
sidle up beside Fred Dobshanski. 

“Don’t you guys know? There’s a 
big drive cornin’ up. General Mac 
Williams is gonna talk to us him- 
self.” ^ 

Whitey was right beside me. He 
sure was a fimny guy, always hang- 

78 



ing around and asking questions. 
Sometimes I used to wonder what 
he looked like. You get used to not 
seeing any of the guys when you’re 
in the forward areas. Sometimes for 
weeks or months at a time a whole 
area will be contaminated with bac- 
teria or radiation and you don’t 
open your suit at all. Even if you’re 
wounded the mecho-armor gives 
you a shot and takes you back to a 
field hospital . that is, if it’s still 
working. So you get used to not 
knowing what the guys look like 
and not caring much. But with 
Whitey it was different. His voice 
had such a dull someplace-else 
sound to it that you got to won- 
dering if there was really anyone 
in that suit of armor or not. You got 
to wondering if maybe it just 
walked around by itself. 

“Mac Williams? Who’s he?” 
Whitey asks as if in answer to my 
thoughts. 

“Hell, don’t you know any- 
thing?” Fred says. 

“I guess I don’t. I . I . 
don’t even know who I was. I sorta 
wish I knew who I used to be.” 

“Mac Williams is Fightin’ Joe 
Mac Williams. He’s going to talk 
to us. Look . there he is now.” 

I adjusted my eyepieces for direct 
vision and sure enough on the kind 
of balcony on the back of this big 
armored crawler was a guy. I mean 
to tell you he sure looked like some- 
thing too. He was in full battle 
armor with scarlet trimmings and 
gold rivets. He was wearing a 
mother-of-pearl plated helmet with 
three stars set in rubies. Even the 
twin machine guns that were fitted 
to his armor instead of the 75 re- 
coilless and 40 mm we had on ours 
was plated to look like silver. 

GEORGE H. SMITH 




“Gosh! Imagine a General com- 
ing ’way up here in all this mud 
and stuff. That guy must really have 
guts!” someone mutters on the com- 
pany circuit. 

“Yeah. I bet he’s only got one 
swimming pool in that land yacht 
of his.” 

“Shut up! What’s the matter 
with you? That ain’t no way to 
talk. You a sub or something?” 
“Say, did you guys see what I saw 
through the windows of that crawl- 
er? Dames!” 

“Dames?” 

“Who you kiddin’?” 

“So help me. There was two of 
them. Two big, tall, willowy, blond 
WAG Captains!” 

“Them’s the General’s aides.” 
“Yeah? What do they aid him 
at?” 

“Shut up you guys,” the Cap- 
tain’s voice cuts in. “The General 
is going to speak.” 

Well then he starts right in tell- 
ing us about the great crusade we’re 
engaged upon and how civilization 
is at stake. And how proud the 
home folks is of us. Of course, he 
admits we haven’t had any direct 
word from the States since last year 
when we had those big cobalt bomb 
raids, but he just knows that they 
all love us. Right when he starts I 
know we’re in for trouble, ’cause 
when the brass start talking about 
crusades, a lot of joes is gonna get 
killed. 

He goes on with this for half an 
hour, and all the time the TV 
cameras is grinding away from this 
other crawler that is filled with 
newsers and video people. He men- 
tions blood 16 times and that ain’t 
good. Sweat he says 14 times and 

THE LAST CRUSADE 



guts an even dozen. When it really 
looks bad, though, is when he calls 
the Major and the Captain up and 
pins a medal on each of the medal 
racks that officers wear on the front 
of their armor. When they start 
passing out the medals ahead of 
time, brother, it ain’t good, it ain’t 
good at all. 

When he gets through with all 
this, the old boy retires into his 
crawler. 

“I guess he’s going in to plan the 
battle,” I says. 

“Ha,” says Sergeant Coleman’s 
voice in my ear. “All the blood and 
guts in that speech wore him out so 
much he’s got to retire to his bar 
for a few quick ones with them two 
aides of his.” 

“Now, Sarge,” I says, “that ain’t 
no way for a patriot to talk.” 

“My patriotism is at a very low 
ebb at the moment. Do you know 
what kind of a party we’re going to 
have in the morning?” 

“No,” I says, “but I would be 
interested in finding out.” 

“You’ve seen that huge mile-long 
building that’s across the square 
from us?” 

“I’ve seen it and found little to 
like about it. The enemy has every 
kind of gun in there that’s been 
invented.” 

“Well, the Captain says that 
that’s it! Fighting Joe wants us to 
take it.” 

‘^Remember boys, remember that 
the way of life in the W,D.P,F.R. is 
better. Remember what youWe 
fighting for—hotdogs and new cars, 
electric refrigerators and apple pie, 
sweethearts and mother, DonH let 
mother down boysP* 

A voice that used to sell us bath 
soap is selling us war.

“That kind of sounds like we’re 
getting ready to move in, don’t it 
Sarge?” I says. 

Sure enough a half hour later we 
starts to move up. The whole com- 
pany of thirty men is on its way 
with the rest of the battalion close 
behind. 

“Say, maybe there’ll be some 
dames up ahead,” Dobshanski is 
saying. 

“What do you want with dames? 
You got the Waiting Wife and the 
Faithful Sweetheart on your TV, 
ain’t you?” the Sergeant says. 

“It ain’t the same. It ain’t the 
same at all,” Dobshanski says, 

I cuts in with, “Hey, did you 
guys hear what I heard? Pretty 
soon we won’t really need women 
anymore. Those new suits of armor 
we’re going to get have got Realie 
TV sets in ’em. When a gal comes 
on it’s just like she was in the suit 
with you. Those suits is gonna take 
care of everything and I mean 
everything.” 

“Ah, who ya kiddin’? Who ya 
handin’ that line to?” 

“Him and his inside dope!” 

Twenty minutes later we’re in 
position among the wrecked build- 
ings on our side of the square and 
several kinds of hell is traveling 
back and forth across it. As is usual, 
the enemy seems to have as good an 
idea as to what we’re about as we 
have. 

“Oh, brother,” Coleman moans. 
“Did Mac Williams send them a 
copy of his orders as soon as he got 
through writing them?” 



EAVY SHELLS and rockets 
is plowing up the already 
plowed up pavement all around us. 

80 



Geysers of mud and water are be- 
ing lifted by shells on all sides. I 
sees a couple of guys go down and 
I stumbles over a tangled mess of 
armor and flesh as we break from 
cover and start across the hundred 
yards or so of the square. 

Floater rockets are overhead, cir-. 
cling kind of lazy like and lighting 
up the whole company as pretty as 
a summer’s day with big magnesium 
flares. It’s real comfortin’ to see 
guys on all sides of you, but not so 
comfortin’ when you sees them 
failin’ right and left. 

I know I’m running with the rest 
of the guys ’cause I can hear my 
power pack rev up and feel the 
steel legs of my suit pounding along 
through the mud. I can feel the 
suit automatically swerving to avoid 
shell holes and to throw off the 
enemy aim. Not that they’re really 
aiming, they’re just tossing every- 
thing they got into that square and 
bettin’ on the law of averages. The 
whole length of the big marble 
building we’re after is lit up now, 
but not with lights, it’s lit up with 
gun flashes. 

The company and battalion radio 
bands is a mess. Even the command 
circuit is filled with guys yellin’ and 
screamin’, but there don’t seem to 
be much point to orders right now 
anyway. I keep on goin’ cause I 
don’t know what else to do. Once 
or twice I recognise Coleman and 
White by the numbers on their ar- 
mor and I get one glimpse of Fred 
Dobshanski just as half a dozen 
70 mm shells tear his armor and 
him apart. 

Then I’m almost at the building, 
and I’m being hit by pointblank 
light machine-gun fire. I’m blazing 
back with my 40 and 75, pouring 

GEORGE H. SMITH 





tracers through the windows and 
being thankful my armor can take 
machine gun fire even at close 
range. 

There’s other guys all around me 
now and we’re smashing through 
doors and crashing over window 
sills into the building. The place 
is full of enemy joes and they’re hit- 
ting us with everything they can 
throw. I take a couple of 40 mm 
shells that knock me off my feet, 
but Whitey blasts the gun crew two 
seconds later. We fight our way up 
a pair of marble stairways and 
they’re really pouring it on us from 
up above, when suddenly they take 
a notion to rush us and come rush- 
ing down the steps . about three 
hundred of them. 

What we did to them ain’t pret- 
ty. That light plastic battle armor 
of theirs don’t even look like stop- 
ping our stuff ; and packed together 
like they are on those steps, it’s 
murder. A lot of them get to the 
bottom, but there ain’t much left of 
them when they get there. 

It’s all over then. Guys are yell- 
ing for the Medic robot and for 
the Ammo robots and others are 
just slumped down in their suits 
waiting for something else to hap- 
pen . and it ain’t long in hap- 
pening. It can’t be more than ten 
minutes after we chased the last 
Red out the back of our objective 
before their heavy guns’re trying 
to knock it down around our ears. 

Armor or no armor, what’s left 
of the battalion takes refuge in the 
cellars where a few hours before 
the Reds were playing possum from 
our guns. Coleman, Whitey and I 
find us a nice heavy beam and are 
standing under it. Coleman is talk- 
ing, as usual, and Whitey is wonder- 

THE LAST CRUSADE 



ing who he is and I’m watching the 
Major and Captain take inventory. 
Our assets ain’t what they used to 
be. There’s about twenty guys left 
in our company and maybe about 
sixty-five in the whole battalion. 

I guess that’s why the Major ain’t 
very friendly when some of the 
guys dig out a couple dozen wom- 
en and children who’ve been hiding 
in the building. 

“Well, I’ll be damned! Look 
w^hat’s cornin’ in!” I says to Cole- 
man. There’s maybe twenty women 
and the rest is kids. 

“Why do the kids always seem to 
outlast the rest of the people, 
Sarge?” I asks. “Every place we 
been in this town, there’s always 
more kids left alive than older 
folks.” 

“I don’t know. Ward. Maybe 
they make a smaller target.” 

They’ve already got the kids 
lined up and we’ve given ’em the 
candy bars wrapped in propaganda 
leaflets that we all carry. Like all 
foreigners, they ain’t very polite or 
grateful. They can’t even under- 
stand what I’m saying even when I 
turn up my outside amplifier full 
power. 

“What’s the matter with them 
punks? Don’t they appreciate can- 
dy?” I asks the sergeant who is mut- 
tering to one of them in some of 
their own gibberish. 

“They say the Russians didn’t 
give them anything but lumps of 
sugar and we don’t give them any- 
thing but candy. They’d like some- 
thing else.” 

“Now ain’t that just like people 
like them,” I says to White. “No 
gratitude to us for liberating them 
or for feedin’ ’em.” 

“I think I would know what it’s 

81 




all about if I could just remember. 
You know, Sarge, for a few minutes^ 
up' above there I almost remem- 
bered. Then the shelling started and 
. and ... I don’t know . .” 
Whitey is still harping on his favor- 
ite subject so I turns back to the 
sergeant and the kids he’s talkin’ to. 

“What’s with these punks? What 
they got to complain about? If it 
wasn’t for us they wouldn’t have 
no country.” 

“They say that the Russians was 
about to take them away to a camp 
and make soldiers out of them and 
they’re afraid we’ll do the same.” 
“Well . what in hell do they 
want to do? Spend the rest of their 
lives hiding in a hole while we do 
their fighting?” 

“This youngster says he doesn’t 
want to be brain washed. He doesn’t 
want to be a soldier.” 

“He’s right,” Whitey pipes up. 
“He don’t want to be like me. You 
know, I had a dream ... or did I 
remember? Anyway in this . 
dream ... of mine, I remembered 
that I had been an important per- 
son like you said. Ward. But not on 
the enemy side. I knew something 
and wanted to tell it to the whole 
army but they didn’t want me to. 
That’s why they sent me to the 
psycho machines. That’s why they 
made me like I am.” 

“What was it you knew. White?” 
the sergeant asks. 

“I’m not sure. It was something 
. something about there not 
being any more Western Federation 
or any Eastern Republics ... no 
more America ... no more Russia 
. just two self-perpetuating arm- 
ies .. like hoards of maggots 
crawling across the corpse of Eu- 
rope.” 

82 



“That’s a funny sort of dream 
. a very funny sort of dream,” 
the sergeant says. 

“Why would you have any sort 
of crazy dream like that?” I de- 
mands. “You know we hear broad- 
casts about how things are getting 
along so fine back home all the 
time.” 

“How long’s it been since you 
got a letter, Ward?” Coleman asks. 

“Letter? I don’t remember. 
Who’d write to me anyway? What’s 
the matter with them kids? Do they 
want the Russians to come back and 
rape their mothers and sisters?” 

“I’ll ask them,” Sarge says, and 
starts gibbering again through his 
outside amplifier to a skinny brat 
that’s doing the talking for all of 
them. Pretty quick the kid gabbles 
back just like he understood. 

“He says that their mothers and 
sisters have been raped so many 
times by both sides that it don’t 
make any difference anymore.” 

“They ain’t got no ^at ...” I 
starts to say but the Major is yelling 
at the Captain so I stops to listen. 

“Where are their men? Where 
are they hiding?” He shakes his 
fist under the noses of these French 
women and the Captain questions 
them. 

“Why did they permit the Rus- 
sians to hide out in this building? 
Don’t they know that being here is 
collaborating with the enemy? 
Where are their men? I’ll have 
them hung!” The Major is really 
hopping mad. 

“I beg your pardon, sir.” The 
Captain interrupts him. “This 
woman says that, their men are on 
the second floor and ...” 

“Good! Send six men up there 
and hang every one of them.” 

GEORGE H. SMITH 




“Sir, they say that the Russians 
have already hung them. As Ameri- 
can collaborationists, sir!” 

“What! Humph! Well . send 
some men up there to cut them 
down and hang them again. No! 
Wait, Captain! We’ll wait until the 
TV cameras get here.” 

It was just then that the word 
came for us to pull back, for us 
to give up this building and fall 
back to our old positions. 

“My God! What’s the matter 
with them?” Whitey says. “After 
all the guys we lost taking this 
place, why do we have to give it 
up?” 

“Maybe they want us to do it 
over again for the TV,” the Ser- 
geant says as we watch the other 
two companies pull out, herding 
the civilians before them. 

“I don’t want to go,” Whitey 
says suddenly. “If I stay here I 
might remember.” 

“To hell with it, Whitey,” Cole- 
man tells him. “Maybe you 
wouldn’t like it if you did remem- 
ber. Maybe you’re better off this 
way.” 

“I like it here. There used to be 
pictures up above ... I found a 
piece of one during the fighting . , 
it was . beautiful.” 

“Come on, Whitey! Let’s get 
going! Don’t you see what the Cap- 
tain’s doing?” I says. The others 
look and start moving fast. The 
Captain must have been mad about 
giving up our objective ’cause he’d 
set up a disrupter bomb on the floor 
and started a time f*se. Maybe 
you’ve never seen a disrupter bomb 
and maybe you wouldn’t want to. 
In a way they’re an improvement 
on the atomic bomb. They cause in- 
dividual atomic explosions that 

THE LAST CRUSADE 



keep blasting for hours after you 
start them. When that bomb gets 
through, there won’t be anything 
left. 

Pretty quick we’re out in the 
open and running as fast as our 
mechos legs can carry us. We’re 
about halfway across the square 
when I see Whitey suddenly break 
away from Coleman and head back 
toward the building. 

He gets there and is heading in 
the door just as the disrupter bomb 
lets loose. That building started do- 
ing a dance, a kind of strip tease 
I guess, ’cause it’s shedding roof 
and walls right and left. 

Later on, when we’re back in our 
lines, I’m sitting beside Coleman 
while our mecho-armor is whipping 
up some X-rations for us. 

“Why did he do it, Sarge? Why’d 
Whitey go back?” 

“I don’t know. There was some- 
thing about that building that he 
thought he remembered. It re- 
minded him of something. That 
picture he found kind of set him 
off. He said maybe it was the last 
one there was in the world.” 

“Did . did he remember who 
he was?” 

“I guess at the last he did . 
or at least he remembered some 
thing.” 

“Did he remember his name?” 

“I guess so.” 

“Well, what was it?” 

“He didn’t tell me. Maybe his 
name was Man.” 

“Man? That’s a funny name. 
Well , . his name sure is mud 
now.” 

“Maybe the two names are the 
same. Ward,” he says. The ser- 
geant always was a funny guy.

If historians have ever pondered that eerie and magical 
transformation of Abigaile Goodyeare, that “faire 
young maide” who aged so before the disbelieving eyes of 
gallows witnesses, mayhaps herein lies the answer . 



BY HERB WILLIAMS' 



I saw this faire young maide, 
Abigaile Goodyeare^ standing yon- 
der on ye gallows and shee saith

WITCHCRAFT IN EARLY AMERICA 

VOLUME II, CHAPTER 4 

N at LYON looked nervously 
at the girl huddled in the cor- 
ner of the time machine. There 
were white streaks down her face 
where recent tears had washed off 
the grime of several days spent in a 



84

primitive jail. 

Her almost jet black hair was a 
tangled mess, hanging in strings to 
her shoulders. He wrinkled his nose 
in distaste at the odor filling the 
small compartment. There was ro- 
mance in history, he thought, when 
viewed in the abstract, but not 
when one faced history in the per- 
son of a female who had languished 
several days in an unsanitary prison. 

“Pray, Sir,” she asked slowly, 
and so softly he scarcely heard her, 
“Art thou the Lord? Or one of 
His Angels?” 

Nat started to laugh, but she 
looked so pitiful he checked him- 
self. “No, I’m a human being, just 
like yourself — except that I’ve never 
been accused of witchcraft!” 

A look of fear crossed her face. 
“Verily, I testify unto thee that I 
am no witch, but have the fear of 
God before mine eyes.” She was al- 
most frantic in her statement. She 
cringed farther into the corner. Nat 
noticed the raw wounds on her 
wrists where the irons had chafed 
her. 

“Sure, sure, I believe you,” Nat 
said sharply. “They won’t hang you 
now!” Then he added glumly, “But 



they’ll probably do worse to me if 
they find out what Fve done!” 

She looked up at him, wonder 
in her deep blue eyes, her long 
lashes blinking slowly. Even her 
bedraggled appearance and the dirt 
that literally covered her could not 
hide from Nat the beauty of her 
eyes. “Then perhaps thou art an 
emissary of the Evil One, though 
thou hast a kind look to thy features 
that seemeth not to come of the 
Devil.” 

This time Nat laughed. He had 
read the ancient records known as 
hooks but hearing someone talk in 
archaic book fashion was too much. 
“That was quite a speech. Pretty 
Eyes. But get it through your head 
that I’m a normal human who had 
a momentary lapse and did an ab- 
normal thing. I used the paralysis 
ray on wide range, stopped the show 
and hauled you off the gallows. 
Right now we’re in a time machine 
headed for . I’m not sure where.” 

The girl forgot her fear in mo- 
mentary puzzlement. “Paraly.sis 
ray?” she repeated slowly, “Stop 
the show? Time machine?” 

“Oh, skip it,” he said. “What we 
need right now is a chance to get 



85 



you cleaned up — and I think I 
know just the place. There’s a pret- 
ty beach in 18th century Mexico. 
It’s warm, and there’s a fresh water 
stream running into the ocean. You 
can wash off some of that prison 
grime.” 

The sun beat down on Nat’s 
blonde head as he sat on a rock 
overlooking a river mouth and sev- 
eral miles of Mexican beach. Abby 
— he’d finally discovered that her 
name was Abigaile Goodyeare — 
was behind a clump of bushes be- 
side the stream, vainly trying to 
wash her voluminous clothing. 

Now that the shock and humor 
had passed, Nat was deeply wor- 
ried. He couldn’t take Abby back to 
his own time and announce that 
he hadn’t the heart to see her 
hanged, on the other hand, he 
simply could not take her back to 
17th century New England to be 
hanged for witchcraft. If he 
dropped her off in any other time, 
they’d think she was insane. 

Nat had been making a routine 
historical survey, part of the work 
on his thesis about life in 17th cen- 
tury New England. And on his first 
venture into time, he had ended up 
committing one of the most serious 
crimes possible in his society — Time 
Meddling. 

Earlier in the day, just before 
leaving Earth University in the 25th 
century, tall, ascetic Anton Bor, 
Chief of the Time Inspection 
Corps, had impressed on him the 
penalties for Time Meddling. Fix- 
ing Nat with cold grey eyes, Bor had 
recited the familiar warning in cal- 
culated tones: “At no time, and 
under no circumstance, are people 
in past ages to know they are being 

86 



observed.” 

It was Nat’s first solo adventure 
into time, and his indoctrination, 
as thorough as it was, had not pre- 
pared him for the shock he experi- 
enced a few hours later. 

He had been completely unpre- 
pared for the scene that lay before 
his eyes as he came out of the thick 
woods into a clearing. 

A gallows had been erected on a 
mound in the center of the cleared 
space and a large crowd had 
gathered to watch what seemed to 
be an execution. 

Checking his invisibility shield, 
Nat moved closer. 

A tall, gaunt man, with a look 
of righteous wrath on his face was 
reading from a scroll. Except for 
his clothing, the man looked exactly 
like Anton Bor, Chief of the TIC. 
Nat shook his head in disbelief, but 
strained his ears to hear what the 
man was reading. 

“. she was found guilty of 
felonyes and witchcrafts whereof 
she stood indicted and sentence of 
death accordingly passed that she 
be hanged by the neck until she 
be dead . .” 

Nat tore his eyes from the man 
with the scroll and looked at the 
witch. 

He gasped audibly at what he 
saw, so that several people nearby 
looked curiously around. Realizing 
his error, he stood completely still 
until the people he had disturbed 
turned their attention back to the 
gallows. 

Again he looked at the woman. 
She was no half insane old hag, a 
busybody who had meddled her 
way into a witchcraft trial, but a 
bewildered, fearful young woman 
who couldn’t have been more than 



HERB WILLIAMS 




18 or 19 years old. 

Her hands were tied behind her 
back, pulling her bulky dress tight 
across her bosom. Her tangled, 
matted, black hair, the dirt on her 
face, her wrinkled disheveled cloth- 
ing could not hide a great natural 
beauty. 

But what affected Nat most, was 
the look on her face. It was that of 
a frightened, helpless animal, cor- 
nered by a vicious, heartless pred- 
ator. 

The self-righteous bearing of the 
tall man, the lack of sympathy and 
idle curiosity mirrored in the faces 
of the crowd infuriated Nat. 

Impulsively he had used his pa- 
ralysis ray, an instrument that was 
designed only as a last resort when 
a time traveler needed to beat a 
quick retreat unnoticed. While the 
entire gathering was in a suspended 
state, he had carried Abby away 
from the gallows, and clocked away 
in the time machine. 

Now, completely confused, he 
was sitting worriedly in the warm 
sunshine of 18th century Mexico, 
wondering what to do. 

Abby’s approach broke his rev- 
erie. She seemed almost lost in one 
of his spare one-piece coveralls. She 
was carrying her own garments, 
dripping wet, on her arm. In mod- 
esty she had put her own quaint 
shoes on again. 

Her dark hair curled wetly about 
her shoulders, and the exertion of 
bathing and washing her clothing 
had left a becoming flush on her 
cheeks. 

“Feel better, Abby?” he asked in 
a light-hearted manner he didn’t 
feel. 

“Verily, thou art a strange one,” 
she answered, lowering her eyes in 

A WITCH IN TIME 



an almost obsequious manner. 
“Though the way thou useth the 
diminutive of my name is pleasant 
to my ear.” 

“Well, your pretty face is pleas- 
ant to my eyes, but it’s certainly 
gotten me into a lot of trouble,” 
Nat answered gruffly. 

She looked downcast. “Truly 
I’m contrite if I have caused thee 
trouble.” The penitent look on her 
face melted Nat’s irritability. 

“Let’s eat,” he said quickly. 
“You must be hungry. And while 
you eat. I’ll try to explain what 
happened and maybe figure out 
what to do.” 

A week passed, and Nat still was 
undecided. He was puzzled by a 
strange restlessness that nagged at 
him constantly. 

That is, he was puzzled until the 
first time he kissed her. 

The difference in their back- 
grounds was vast. They were sep- 
arated by centuries of time. But 
now, thrown together, facing a 
common fear of the past and the 
future, there could be only one 
outcome. 

At the end of the first week, they 
were sitting on opposite sides of a 
beach fire. A soft breeze, blowing 
off the water, added a chill to the 
evening air. Abby rose to put an- 
other log on the fire. Nat stood up 
quickly to help her. 

“Let me lift that, Abby,” he said 
with an air of protection. “It’s 
pretty heavy.” 

“Please, no,” she answered in 
her quaint way. “Tis nothing. I 
have lifted heavier burdens than 
this many times.” 

He put his hand on her wrist. It 
was the first time he had touched 
her since he had carried her from 



87 




the gallows. For the past week he 
had been so preoccupied he had 
hardly noticed her as she had gone 
quietly about their impromptu 
camp, cooking the wild game and 
fish he had caught with his paraly- 
sis ray. 

The feel of her soft, warm wrist 
in his hand thrilled him. His voice 
suddenly left him, as he conscious- 
ly realized for the first time how 
beautiful she was. Her fresh inno- 
cence, her complexion, freshly 
tanned by the Southern sun, 
seemed to fill his entire being. He 
drew her close, kissed her full lips. 

Because of her Puritan heritage, 
she exhibited surprise. 

“Verily, Nathanial Lyon, my peo- 
ple would frown on an embrace 
like this.” Then she whispered, 
“But I find it most pleasant, be- 
cause I have grown so very fond of 
thee.” With that she threw her 
arms around him and pressed her 
lips to his. 

Time lost its meaning, and they 
stood for uncounted minutes. At 
last she shivered. “I feel a chill, 
dear Nat.” 

“No wonder, darling,” he whis- 
pered. “We’ve been standing here 
so long the fire has gone out.” 

That night Nat made his deci- 
sion. “I can’t take you back to be 
hanged, Abby,” he said tenderly. 
“But at the same time I can’t go 
back to my own time, they’d do 
worse than that to me.” 

“I understand not this time trav- 
el,” Abby said thoughtfully. “If 
thou canst send this device to any 
time of thy choosing, couldst thou 
not spend months, or even years 
away and still get back to your own 
time when thou art expected?” 

“That’s it, Abby, that’s it!” Nat 

88 



shouted, jumping to his feet. 
“We’ll stay away a lifetime. And 
when we take the machine back, 
they won’t be able to do anything 
that matters because we’ll have 
had our life together! Or better yet, 
we’ll never go back at all!” 

Suddenly he sobered, dropped 
back to the ground beside her, tak- 
ing her hands in his. “That is, if 
you’ll marry me, Abby darling.” 
“Why, Nathanial,” she answered 
without a flicker of a smile. “That 
was all settled when first I yielded 
to thy embrace.” 

Nat’s mouth dropped open, then 
he laughed, as he remembered his 
studies of the customs and morals 
of Abby’s time. 

“Abby, verily thou art priceless,” 
he said delightedly in her own 
speech. 

She gave her opinion of him, si- 
lently . with her lips. 

“Abby,” Nat finally whispered, 
“I’m going to give you the best 
honeymoon a woman ever had.” 
“Honeymoon? Of a truth, I 
know not of what thou speakest.” 
Nat chuckled, then kissed the 
end of her pert nose. “You’ll see, 
my love, you’ll see. But first we 
have to make you Mrs. Nathanial 
Lyon. There was a time, right after 
the Third World War, when mar- 
riage was easy, with no questions 
asked. So right now, it’s off to the 
disorganized world of the late 20th 
century.” 

And so began one of the strang- 
est honeymoons in the history of 
Earth’s human race. 

Nat and Abby were unseen ob- 
servers when Pericles ruled Greece. 
They visited the court of Charle- 
magne, walked through the streets 
of Rome at the height of its splen- 

HERB WILLIAAAS 




dor, viewed the glories and wick- 
edness of Babylon and Baghdad, 
watched the artisans of old Cathay. 

But fate chose their honeymoon 
as the time of their undoing. 

Nat had believed they would be 
safe for the rest of their lives. He 
knew that detection of the time 
machine was virtually impossible 
unless their full dimensional des- 
tination were known to the TIC 
. assuming that he had been 
missed in the 25th century, which 
he believed unlikely. Sealed chro- 
nometers, installed by the TIC, 
would give him away if he ever re- 
turned the time machine to base. 
But premature discovery need be 
the only worry now. 

As he had explained to Abby, 
“The power plant in these things 
gives off traceable radiation, pro- 
vided the tracer gets close enough. 
But right now, tracing us would be 
like looking for a needle in a hay- 
stack. All we’ve got to watch out 
for is another time machine with 
someone aboard who might have 
reason to be suspicious of us.” 

And it happened just that way 
as they sat watching the original 
first night of a Shakespeare play. 
Another time machine controlled 
by an Arts student from Earth 
University appeared in an adjoin- 
ing balcony. Nat flicked his ma- 
chine to full power — too late! The 
student, an acquaintance of Nat’s, 
had nodded in recognition. 

Clocking away, Nat couldn’t 
avoid a glum comment. “Well, the 
TIC probably will be after us in 
full force now.” 

Abby studied Nat’s face. “Dar- 
ling,” she said, “Let’s settle down. 
Why need we travel at all?” 

Her calm erased Nat’s concern. 



“We’ll do it!” he exclaimed, confi- 
dent again. 

N at parked his new model 
T Ford in the garage. He 
walked quickly into the kitchen, 
kissed his wife. It was no perfunc- 
tory peck so much the practice in 
the times in which they lived, but 
a tender, passionate embrace, as if 
it might be their last. 

“Nat, there’s been someone 
around the house today. I’m wor- 
ried,” Abby finally said. 

The muscles in his stomach 
tightened. “Maybe they’ve traced 
us. What did he look like?” 

“He was tall, severe, in fact he 
could almost pass for old Jonathan 
Borden, the man who was in 
charge of my execution, the man 
who read the charges against me.” 
“Anton Bor!” Nat said hoarsely. 
“The head man of the TIC!” 
Abby threw her arms around 
Nat, buried her head in his shoul- 
der. Her arms held him with des- 
peration. “Oh darling, we’ve been 
so happy these past five years. They 
can’t separate us. I’d rather die 
first!” 

He tipped her head back, kissed 
the tears that had trickled down 
each cheek. “If they catch us, we’ll 
probably both die. But at least 
we’re ready for them.” 

He was interrupted by a knock 
on the door. Through the front 
curtains he glimpsed a car in front 
of the house. A hasty look out the 
back revealed another one parked 
in the alley. 

“Quick, Abby, into the basement 
before they use a paralysis ray,” he 
whispered. Aloud he shouted, “Just 
a moment!” to the person at the 

89 



A WITCH IN TIME 




front door. 

With nervous fingers Nat un- 
locked a heavily reinforced door in 
the basement. He heard a crash up- 
stairs as the front door was bat- 
tered in. At almost the same in- 
stant he swung the door open and 
they stepped into the time machine. 
With movements they had prac- 
ticed many times, he tripped the 
activating lever and the machine 
vanished, leaving the hiding place 
Nat had built around the machine 
after they had bought the house 
several years earlier. 

They weren’t a moment too 
soon, for both felt the slight tin- 
gling of a paralysis ray. Their de- 
parture had occurred just at the 
split second when one of Bor’s TIC 
men had pushed the firing stud. 
Even so, it clouded Nat’s vision, 
slowed his reflexes. 

“Another second and they’d have 
had us, Abby,” he said aloud, after 
he had returned to normal. 

She pressed her lips to his. “I 
hated to leave 1925, but we can 
start over again wherever you say,” 
Abby whispered. 

The surf crashed and boomed 
on the coral reef. Nat lay in the 
shade of a cocoanut palm, watch- 
ing the white clouds scudding by 
overhead. 

Abby came walking down the 
beach towards him, tanned a deep 
brown from head to foot, dressed 
as the Polynesians had dressed be- 
fore Captain Cook had discovered 
them. 

“You’re every bit as beautiful as 
the women described in the old 
tales of the South Sea Islands,” Nat 
said as she sat down beside him. 

“And you’re as big a flatterer as 

90 



any sailor who ever told those 
stories,” she answered, although she 
was pleased by his admiration. She 
lay back, stretched her hands over 
her head with a happy look on her 
face. “I’m 30 years old and don’t 
compare to our young neighbors on 
the other islands.” 

Nat rolled over, putting an arm 
across her waist, kissed her tender- 
ly. “I’m the luckiest man in the 
world,” he whispered. 

She looked up, her blue eyes 
serious. “You don’t regret giving 
up all you had in your own time?” 

“I didn’t know what true hap- 
piness was,” he answered firmly. 
“People in the 25th century are au- 
tomatons, hemmed in by rules, reg- 
ulations, regimented by necessity 
because there are so many billions 
on the planet.” 

He kissed her again, as the 
warm trade winds ruffled her dark 
hair — and they forgot about time. 

But they didn’t have real peace 
of mind. Fear of the TIC and the 
tenaciousness of Anton Bor was al- 
ways present. 

Nat and Abby had learned the 
language thoroughly through the 
time machine’s hypno-translator, 
then picked an uninhabited little 
island in the atoll. After weeks of 
sun bathing, they had let them- 
selves be discovered by the natives 
in their outrigger canoes. 

The natives quietly accepted 
Nat and Abby as slightly different, 
but members of their informal so- 
ciety, for it was inconceivable to 
them that any but their own kind 
could be living on one of the atolls. 

“This is a heavenly life,” Abby 
sighed, stretching out on the sand 
one day. “Cocoanuts, breadfruit, 

HERB WILLIAMS 




seafood, all for the taking. I’ll hate 
to leave it.” 

“But I’m afraid we must,” Nat 
said slowly, “And soon, too. We 
don’t dare stay too long in one 
place.” 

From the islands, Nat and Abby 
drifted on from century to century, 
usually stopping in post-war periods 
when both governments and popu- 
lations were preoccupied with con- 
structive social progress. 

It was during the American 
reconstruction period following 
World War III that they again 
were tracked down by the TIG. 

Nat was an engineer, rebuilding 
shattered Seattle, when one day he 
spotted a tall, angular mechanic, 
newly hired on the project — and 
unmistakably Anion Bor! 

Ten years before, Nat and Abby 
had cached the time machine a 
hundred miles away. Now, as they 
winged through the night in their 
private helicopter, Nat groaned at 
the futility of matching wits with 
scientists of century twenty-five. 

“I don’t understand it, Abby! 
There’s atomic radiation lingering 
here from the war. We’re working 
on a reactor for the city’s power 
plant, yet Bor and his TIC manage 
to track us down.” 

“Perhaps, Dear Nat,” Abby said, 
lapsing into her original old New 
England speech, as she often did 
when thinking deeply, “He follow- 
eth us by inductive methods rather 
than through his science.” 

There was a moment’s silence. 
Nat broke it to say, “We’ve been 
doing the obvious. Well then, our 
next stop must be different!” 

They cruised silently toward the 
hiding place of their time machine 
until they saw the faint glow of a 

A WITCH IN TIME 



radioactive crater. A missile miss- 
ing its target, had gouged a large 
hole in the mountainside. Nat had 
hidden the time machine in a cave 
as close as possible to the crater to 
lessen the chance of detection by 
the TIC or casual explorers. 

“Just in case they have spotted 
our machine, and someone is wait- 
ing for us, we’re going to take the 
last few miles on foot,” Nat said, 
checking his paralysis gun. 

He set the heli down in a clear- 
ing and they started cautiously for- 
ward on foot, working their way up 
the mountainside, with all the ten- 
sion of a hunter stalking game. 

A hundred yards from the cave 
entrance, they spotted a campfire. 
They approached stealthily, and 
finally were able to make out the 
shadowy form of an old man, ap- 
parently a war hermit who had set 
up a mountain retreat. 

At the very outset of the Third 
World War, the expression “take 
to the hills” had become a reality 
to many. Afterwards, when a pros- 
trated world had begun painful re- 
construction, lone men and women, 
and sometimes couples, continued 
to roam through the forests and 
deserts of Earth. Fugitives from 
fear in the beginning, many had 
held to the nomadic existence, lik- 
ing their new individuality. 

“He may be a TIG agent in dis- 
guise,” Nat whispered. 

“Why not use thy paralysis ray 
now?” Abby whispered back, “And 
not take chances.” 

Nat nodded, and silently they 
crept forward. When they finally 
were in range, Nat raised his weap- 
on and pressed the stud. 

The hermit didn’t move a mus- 
cle. The dancing flames of the fire 

91 




cast strange shadows over the camp 
site, reflecting off his shelter half, 
lighting the coffee pot sitting on a 
rock. 

Swiftly, without fear of detec- 
tion, Nat and Abby strode forward, 
towards the cave and their escape. 

As they reached the entrance 
they heard a derisive laugh. 
Whirling sharply, they saw the 
“hermit” rising slowly to his feet, a 
late 20th century weapon in his 
hand. 

Horror stricken, Nat glanced at 
the paralysis ray in his own hand, 
the thought flashing across his mind 
that the tiny atomic battery had 
given out. 

“No, your weapon is still good! 
You just didn’t count on our thor- 
oughness!” the man laughed, using 
the vernacular of Nat’s own time. 
“I’ve been waiting here a year, 
while Bor combed the whole area 
for you.” 

“Lord, Abby!” Nat gasped 
hoarsely. “They’ve developed a 
neutralizing field, something they 
were experimenting with when I 
left.” 

The agent laughed coarsely in 
agreement. “Just come away from 
the cave while I put in a call to In- 
spector Bor!” 

They moved towards the fire, 
and it was then that the agent got 
a good look at Abby. 

His eyes moved slowly from her 
head to her feet, taking in every 
detail of her full figure. “Some dish 
you have there Lyon. I’m begin- 
ning to understand why you 
checked out on us!” 

Nat was surprised at the agent’s 
obvious lechery. Such animal re- 
action had been largely overcome 
by the 24th century. 

92 



The agent snickered, recogniz- 
ing Nat’s surprise. “You asked for 
it, Lyon, when you tried to para- 
lyze me! There’s still a little prob- 
lem to be solved in this matter of 
neutralizing a paralysis ray. Right 
now I’m morally drunk, haven’t an 
inhibition in the world.” He licked 
his lips. “Come here, girl. I want 
to see you close up — real close!” 
Abby had drawn back, horrified, 
but now she leaned toward Nat 
and started talking in the ancient 
Greek they had learned during their 
honeymoon. “Let me try to seduce 
him, Nat. Maybe we can get away 
before Bor gets here!” 

“What’s she mumbling about?” 
the agent demanded suspiciously. 

“She’s talking Greek,” Nat ex- 
plained. “She doesn’t understand 
the Anglo-oriental combination we 
speak in the 25th century.” 

The agent’s eyes flitted back to 
Abby, noting her dark hair, her 
even features, moving hungrily 
over her figure again. 

“Come here!” he ordered husk- 
ily, motioning with his hands. 

Abby stepped hesitantly forward, 
a perfectly simulated look of puz- 
zlement on her face. Nat stepped 
forward at the same time, hoping 
to get closer to the guard. 

“Stay where you are,” the agent 
snarled, waving his weapon at Nat. 

Abby looked around at Nat with 
a cautioning expression on her face 
as the agent moved slowly towards 
her. 

Careful to keep the gun pointed 
at Nat, the agent put out a hand, 
slid his arm around her waist. 

Nat could tell by her quivering 
shoulders that Abby was revolted 
by the man’s touch, although she 
managed a faint, inviting smile. 

HERB WILLIAMS 




Nat was poised, ready to move in 
when the agent dropped his guard. 
Then he suddenly felt stark terror 
as he saw the man pull out a small 
paralysis gun. 

‘T think I’ll immobilize you, 
Lyon, while I get better acquainted 
with your girl friend,” he rasped. 

Nat jumped, but the ray gun 
caught him in mid-air. 

His thoughts as he regained con- 
sciousness later were an agony of 
confusion. Feeling the familiar sen- 
sation of a time machine in motion, 
he filled in the blank about what 
must have happened to Abby. Sick 
with resignation he opened his 
eyes, then sat up quickly, blinking 
in disbelief, for Abby was sitting at 
the controls of the machine. 

Her blouse was soiled and 
ripped, her hair mussed and Nat 
thought he saw blood on her skirt. 
But she was humming a tune as she 
checked the dials. 

“Abby,” Nat cried. “Are you all 
right?” 

Her smile said more than words. 
“You seem to forget, my dear hus- 
band,” she said happily, coming 
over to him. “We tender New Eng- 
land pioneers learned a few things 
about self protection.” 

“What happened?” 

Abby shuddered. “It wasn’t 
pleasant, having that beast paw 
me, but my apparent willingness 
threw him off guard. About the 
time he started ripping my cloth- 
ing off, I used the little dagger we 
picked up in Renaissance Italy.” 
Suddenly a sob broke through her 
artificial gaiety and she was in Nat’s 
arms, her control completely gone. 
Her body racked with sobs, tears 
streaming down her face. 

A WITCH IN TIME 



“They’re getting closer each time, 
Abby,” Nat said reflectively. “Next 
time they probably will get us.” 
“But we’re still together,” Abby 
said fiercely. “And, if we’re careful, 
they may never find us again.” 
Years passed. Nat and Abby’j^ 
youthful happiness flowered into 
the contentment of those who have 
lived their allotted years in wisdom. 
Nat had retired many years before, 
and he and Abby were content 
with simple pleasures. 

Evenings they sat together on 
the porch of their Florida cottage, 
enjoying the ocean breeze and each 
other’s presence. 

It was on such an evening that 
their world came to an end. 

While they sat as usual, reminis- 
cing, Nat wondered aloud if Anton 
Bor still lived. He scarcely had ut- 
tered the question before the grass 
on the lawn seemed to shimmer 
slightly, and a time machine ma- 
terialized before their startled eyes. 
Its door burst open and three men 
sprang out with weapons ready. 

After them came the halting, de- 
crepit figure of an ancient Anton 
Bor, a paralysis gun wavering un- 
steadily in his shriveled hands. 

The shock was so great that Nat 
and Abby sat completely unmoving 
and the full power of Bor’s weapon 
caught them where they sat. 

N at and abby stood before 
the Judgement Tribunal in the 
25th century. Mere punishment had 
long since passed out of existence. 
A law breaker had his case re- 
viewed by a board of psychiatrists, 
lawyers, sociologists, even histor- 
ians. A person’s past was laid bare, 
in an effort to find out why aber- 

93 




rant action had been taken. 

The board recommended reme- 
dial action that varied greatly from 
case to case. 

“We find you guilty,” the spokes- 
man finally stated, “of Time Med- 
dling, an offence that can have 
the gravest consequences. In this 
case, our problem is two-fold. First, 
we must correct the original ac- 
tion. Second, we must do all in our 
power to discourage actions such 
as you have taken. 

“With this in mind, you, per- 
sonally, will see corrective meas- 
ures carried out. Anton Bor, who 
worked so self-sacrificingly over so 
many years to bring this case to a 
close, will supervise the correction.” 

This time Nat was prepared. The 
scene was exactly as he remem- 
bered it. But now the gallows was 
empty, the spectators frozen statues. 

“The paralysis ray’s effects last 
for a little more than five minutes,” 
Bor said with the coldness of a ma- 
chine. “We have that much time 
to accomplish our job.” 



Bound and helpless, Nat heard 
Bor bark a command. 

He saw an assistant pick up the 
paralysed form of his wife, dressed 
again in 17th century style, and 
walk out across the valley. He 
placed Abby on the gallows, put 
the rope around her neck and 
moved quickly back to the woods. 

“Now we’ll watch it,” Bor said 
with cold finality. “I think my an- 
cestor out there, Jonathan Borden 
would be proud of me,” he added 
with a trace of smugness. 

“. flj we watched, it seemed sud- 
denly our vision blurred and there 
was the smell of brimstone in the 
aire and when we could see againe, 
there in the place of comely young 
Abigaile Goodyeare, was a wrin- 
kled gruesome crone, more like un- 
to a spectre, with gray hair and 
wrinkled visage, whose true age 
could only be guessed at^

INHIBITION 



Regardless of scientific attainment, any culture is vulnerable 
to inhibition. And Saxon was a good agent; no culture 
nor individual would sway his loyal appraisal . 



BY JAMES CAUSEY

LANETFALL. 

Here the forest was green and 
cool. A soft, damp wind promised 
rain. The colonists moved down the 
ramp, staring at the crew members 
piling crates of supplies in the 
meadow beyond. 

Frowns. Then whispers. 

Saxon glanced up. His nostrils 
flared. “Hurry,” he told the crew- 
men, and came forward, beaming. 
He was tired. It showed in his 
feverish, too-bright smile as he said, 
“Afraid Engineering’s a little be- 
hind schedule. They’ll be here to- 
morrow morning to ereQt your city. 
Tonight you’ll have to rough it.” 
Reactions varied. The women 
murmured and moved closer to 
their men. Some smiled. One man 
thoughtfully eyed the mounting 
pyramid of supplies. 

“You’re getting a choice world, 
Jarl,” Saxon said, clapping him on 
the shoulder. “Survey spent thirty 
years here, balancing the ecology, 
wiping out the bugs and carnivores. 
Eden.” Saxon tasted the word like 
wine. 

Jarl Madsen’s face was stone. 
“Aren’t they all named Eden?” 
From the forest came a chittering 
bark, like anthropomorphic laugh- 
ter. Saxon shivered, remembering 
the thing that chittered, the three- 
inch fangs and the talons. “Hardly,” 
he lied. “That, incidentally, was a 
Narl. Herbivore, very harmless.” 
Madsen walked past him, to- 
wards the supplies. 

Saxon moved among the colo- 
nists, shaking hands, congratulat- 
ing, speaking of green fields and 
good crops and a virgin planet 
where every man could carve an 
empire. These last moments were 
the worst, when you said goodbye. 



knowing that thirty percent qf them 
would be dead within the week. He 
saw Madsen opening a supply case. 
Damn him! Just three more min- 
utes! 

The last crew member dumped 
his load and hurried into the air- 
lock. Saxon started casually after 
him, too late. Madsen stood there, 
his grin taut, nailed on. 

“Primitive pre-fab shelters,” he 
said thickly. “Axes and seeds! The. 
city was a lie. We’re on our own, 
is that it? IF A)?—” 

Saxon’s palm flashed and Mad- 
sen fell writhing. There were 
shouts, hands clawing at him as 
he tore free, sprinting for the ship. 

Always running, he thought bit- 
terly. Fm getting old. 

He walked through the silent 
corridors of the ship, a lonely figure 
in the black uniform of the Inhibi- 
tion Corps, and once he stared 
through the porthole at Eden XXI, 
a mottled sphere receding into the 
star-frosted night. His mouth 
twisted. Conceive a colony in fear, 
breed it in terror. Watch it adapt, 
grow. If it grows too fast, hurt it. 
Hurt it with disease, famine, dicta- 
torship. If it keeps growing — 
destroy it. 

The captain came down the cor- 
ridor and stood at respectful atten- 
tion before the black uniform. 
“Stereo call. Commander. Prime 
Base.” 

Saxon slowly went to his cabin. 
The stereo panel was flashing steady 
crimson to designate top priority 
and he restrained a savage impulse 
to shut the thing off. He slumped 
in the control chair, and the tri-di 
image of a man at a desk slowly 
coalesced. It was a granite-featured 




97 




old man with eyes like blue ice, and 
Saxon’s head snapped sharply erect. 
It was Primus Gant, Corps Direc- 
tor. At ninety parsecs Gant’s fea- 
tures were slightly hazed, but his 
voice was clear, sharp as a sword. 
“Report, Commander.” 

“My extrapolation went through 
an hour ago. Also my resignation.” 
Nothing moved in Gant’s face or 
his eyes. Saxon said stiffly, “Planet- 
fall uneventful. Area inimical. Ini- 
tial shock conception, probable 
God-betrayal mythology by fourth 
generation. Those things in the 
forest should get thirty percent of 
them the first week. Weaponless, 
they’ll run. The two to one female 
ratio should make for an agricul- 
tural matriarchy by the sixth gen- 
eration. Recommend intermittent 
check at that time.” He took a slow 
angry breath. “Why didn’t we give 
them weapons?” 

Gant’s smile was acid. “Because 
we haven’t yet tried an agricultural 
matriarchy. Commander. Because 
the lower the initial survival factor, 
the slower the culture development. 
Getting squeamish?” 

Saxon said doggedly, “They 
didn’t have a chance.” 

“Neither did twenty million peo- 
ple on Earth in the last atomic 
war.” The Director’s voice was soft. 
“All colonists volunteer. Some have 
a vision. Others have a latent power 
drive that stasis can’t satisfy. 
They’re misfits regardless, potential 
threats to stasis. Remember your 
last leave. Commander? I believe 
you met my son.” 

Saxon nodded curtly. He remem- 
bered the Director’s son as a quiet, 
soft-spoken youth with the yearn- 
ing for far places in his eyes. 

“I had hoped he woiild qualify 

98 



for the Corps.” Gant looked sud- 
denly old, tired. “Instead he’s 
volunteering for Colonial Service. 
Did you ever lose a son. Com- 
mander?” 

They stared at each other across 
the humming emptiness and Saxon 
finally whispered, “I’m sorry.” 

“Stasis is all we can afford,” the 
Director said numbly. “Man can’t 
have Utopia yet. Because he’s still — 
Man. Perhaps he’ll never have it. 
But by God he’ll try!' Resignation 
withdrawn?” 

Saxon nodded. He could not 
speak. 

“I’m glad. The ship’s captain 
had orders to bum you down had 
you refused.” Gant’s face was 
wooden. “Inhibition agents never 
quit, they just die in harness. You’ll 
take the lifeboat to Eden XI for 
sixth generation check. Good hunt- 
ing, Commander.” 

The image faded. Saxon sat for a 
long time, staring into the dark- 
ness. 



E den XI was three parsecs dis- 
tant, near Algol. For the next 
ten hours Saxon paced the mar- 
velously equipped lifeboat and ab- 
sorbed data from the robot record- 
er. He stared at the hard crystal 
ache of the stars and thought of 
the Director’s son. He thought 
about the shining cities of Earth, 
and about stasis. 

Stasis meant — control. 

It meant control of a billion peo- 
ple, a rigid planetary economy. It 
meant the Assassination branch of 
the Corps. Assassination (carefully 
contrived to appear accidental) 
took care of those few malcontents 
who were either too smart or too 

JAMES CAUSEY 




stupid to sign up for colonization. 
It meant a gradual weeding out of 
the unsane, the power-mad, it 
meant learning the true meaning of 
sanity and peace and racial brother- 
hood. 

And it meant the stagnation of 
science, a thick film of dust gather- 
ing on the textbooks of the military 
tactician, and warships rotting at 
anchor. It meant the white spire of 
the Stasis Administration Center 
at New Washington, and the words 
graven over the golden portals: 

Know thyself, Man, Or die! 

Was the dream worth it? 

Or was Man doomed to die like 
a brawling ape, playing with light- 
ning? 

Saxon could not answer. 

Meanwhile the colonies had to 
be inhibited. One interplanetary 
war could smash the fragile struc- 
ture so painstakingly built over the 
last few hundred years. This was 
the turning point, the final cross- 
roads of Man’s destiny. 

Saxon smiled bleakly. 

Ultimately there would be a 
colony they could neither inhibit 
or destroy. The adaptive ultimate. 
That colony would be Man no 
longer, but Homo Superior. 

But by then, it wouldn’t matter. 

The lifeboat came in on the night 
side of Eden XI, and hung above 
the blue mountains like a basking 
shark. Saxon checked his coordi- 
nates. This had been the original 
landing site, almost two hundred 
years ago. He switched the infra- 
view on maximum, and began to 
cruise in widening spirals. These 
sixth generation hops were usually 
routine. If nomadic, a few political 
shifts could help warp the culture 

INHIBITION 



into a set pattern. A simple matter 
to play the visiting deity, pick one 
warped psychotic, and invest him 
with power. A dictatorship was by 
far the best way of inhibiting a 
young culture. Agricultural city- 
states were almost as easy. Designate 
a particular crop as sacred, kill the 
rotation program, impoverish the 
land, introduce serfdom. 

By dawn, Saxon found what he 
was looking for. A row of cleared 
fields and a farmhouse. He recon- 
noitered a hundred miles farther 
and frowned. There was no clump 
of dwellings, no sign of a village 
trading community. 

He brought the ship down in a 
forest three miles away from the 
farmhouse and camouflaged it to 
look like a great mossy boulder. He 
spent the entire morning testing the 
atmosphere and the soil with a sav- 
age patience. In the early years of 
the Corps, virus mutations had 
taken a fearful toll of intermittent 
spotters. 

Finally he discarded his uniform 
and selected a pair of homespuns 
from the ship’s wardrobe locker. 
Under the homespuns reposed his 
utility kit, a miniature arsenal. 

Late that afternoon he emerged 
from the forest and stood at the 
edge of the cleared fields, a weath- 
erbeaten itinerant, obviously willing 
to chop wood for a meal. Abruptly 
his jaw muscle twitched. 

The scene was pastoral, perfect. 

The man, plowing the south 
forty. The little girl, playing in the 
shadow of the sleepy farmhouse. 

But no beast pulled that plow. 
A giant of a man with power and 
intelligense stamped on his bronze 
features pushed the plow by hand, 
in a die-straight furrow. 

99 




The little girl was blonde and 
elfin. She wore sandals, her tunic 
was brief and plain. She was play- 
ing follow-the-leader — 

With a robot. 

The robot was tall. The sun 
struck sparks from its steel carapace 
as it lumbered after the girl. Saxon 
stood frozen as she came flying to- 
wards him in a burst of tossing 
blond hair and laughter, as she 
saw him and came to a dead halt. 

“Hello,” Saxon said. He tried to 
smile. 

“Hello.” Her inflection was 
slurred. After six generations, natu- 
rally. Her blue eyes sparkled. “Foot- 
sore, stranger?” 

The words had the cadence of a 
ritual greeting. Saxon stared at the 
robot and said carefully, “Yes.” 

“He’s only a primer model,” she 
said, following his gaze. “Next year 
when I’m twelve Father promised 
to install secondary circuits. My 
name’s Veena. What’s yours?” 

Saxon introduced himself, as the 
giant at the plow came forward. 
His white smile was a benediction, 
his voice a lambent organ. “Wel- 
come, rover. Haven’t seen one of 
you in months. I’m Lang, Agricul- 
tural hobbyist. You’ll stay?” 

His tone was almost pleading. 
Saxon nodded inarticulately, fol- 
lowed them towards the farmhouse. 
His hands were shaking. 

The interior of the house was — 
dimensionless. 

For a moment Saxon thought he 
was still outside. A silver brook 
tinkled through the mossy carpet 
that was the floor. The south wall 
was a golden vista of ripe wheat 
rippling in the warm breeze that 
ruffled his hair. Birds twittered in 
the sun-flecked foliage overhead. 

100 



“Nice house,” Saxon said numb- 

Lang’s smile was diflferent. “A 
bit pretentious. I’m afraid. Grand- 
father built it right after the land- 
ing. We’ve been too lazy to do much 
remodeling. A remarkable man, 
Grandfather.” 

That explained it, Saxon thought 
in relief. One titan in an infant 
colony, warping it into a Utopian 
rnold, passing on the heritage of 
his genius. How long, he wondered 
coldly, before they built starships 
and returned to demolish the Earth 
which had exiled them? 

“It must be wonderful to be a 
rover,” Veena said wistfully. “Lang, 
can I go with him when he leaves?” 

“You haven’t completed Basic 
Ecology. Mentor’s waiting for your 
afternoon session.” 

Veena pouted and went outside 
to her robot. Lang grinned. “The 
precocious brat’s beginning to ask 
him questions he can’t answer. Soon 
I’ll have to install a few more cir- 
cuits.” 

Saxon shivered. Regardless of sci- 
entific attainment, any culture is 
vulnerable to inhibition. 

So said his agent’s handbook. 

Later he met Veena’s mother, 
Merl, a handsome woman with 
calm gray eyes who served them 
dinner by firelight. It was a good 
dinner. These colonists seemed like 
good people. A shame they qualified 
for inhibition. 

Gently, Saxon began to probe. 

In only six generations the col- 
onists has scattered throughout the 
entire hemisphere. Although the 
matrix of their culture seemed to 
be the individual family unit, they 
lived according to whim. Some lived 
in small communal groups. Some 

JAMES CAUSEY 




lived alone. Some, by choice, were 
wanderers, rovers. They had sci- 
ence. Their philosophy seemed neb- 
ulous, based on a benevolent ecol- 
ogy, brotherhood with all living 
things. 

Saxon frowned. 

Six generations ago, the ecology 
on this world hardly had been 
benevolent for man. This area of 
the continent had been a steaming 
marsh, swarming with hungry sau- 
rians. Now it was all meadow and 
forest. 

Saxon said thoughtfully, “Have 
you ever felt the need for organiz- 
ation? For a leader?” 

He leaned back and waited for 
the seed to sprout. Two years ago 
on Eden VIII, near Rigel, he had 
said the same thing to a sixth gen- 
eration shaman, and it took scarcely 
a month for the shaman to start an 
intra-tribal war. 

But now the seed fell on sterile 
ground. Lang said, “I don’t under- 
stand. Any problem which cannot 
be solved at family level is referred 
to the annual council.” 

“A leader.” Saxon was patient. 
“One strong man to represent 
everybody. To settle all problems as 
he sees fit?” 

“Remember, Father?” Veena 
prodded. “Those arboreal cannibals 
Grandfather used to mention? They 
had a nomadic tribal culture based 
on brute strength.” 

Lang nodded somberly. “Good 
analogy. The most favorable extra- 
polation indicated a racial life ex- 
pectancy of only ten thousand 
years. Their emotional stability in- 
dex was nil, they would eventually 
have destroyed themselves. The first 
generation decided it would be 
more merciful to exterminate them. 



An unwise decision, I think.” 

He launched into a spirited eth- 
nological discussion with Veena, 
and Saxon sat, numbly. 

They had no emotional insecur- 
ity to feed, no power-hunger. No 
herd instinct to pervert, nothing to 
utilize as destruction potential. 

No cultural weakness. 

The room they gave him was 
small and comfortable. For a time 
he lay on the sleeping hammock, 
considering the situation. He was 
beginning to like them. That in 
itself, was dangerous. 

The house was very still. 

He got quietly out of the ham- 
mock and crept towards the door. 
He had to get back to the lifeboat, 
to feed facts into the monitor. 

One thing disturbed him. 
According to his agent’s hand- 
book, family-group anarchies didn’t 
need inhibition. 

He was halfway across the plowed 
field when Mentor’s iron voice said, 
“Good evening.” 

Moonfire glimmered on metal. 
The robot stood impassively before 
him. Saxon said slowly, “I was just 
going for a walk.” 

“You are our guest: I shall walk 
with you.” 

“I prefer to walk alone.” 
“Guests prefer company. The 
house of Lang must observe the 
basic amenities.” 

Was there a hint of sardonicism 
in Mentor’s voice? 

They walked along the furrows, 
man and robot. Saxon felt beneath 
his shirt for the utility kit. He kept 
his voice level. 

“Am I a prisoner?” 

“You are a guest.” 

“Did Veena tell you I might try 
to escape?” 



INHIBITION 



101 




A pause, while relays clicked si- 
lently. 

“That is classified information.” 

Saxon’s fingers were steady as 
they touched his tiny blaster. Be- 
nevolent anarchy indeed! He said 
carefully, “Do the colonists resent 
their exile?” 

Another pause. Mentor’s voice 
was a flat drone. “The concept is 
meaningless, the question invalid.” 

Like hell it is, thought Saxon, 
and fired. 

A cold blue wash of energy illum- 
inated the robot. For a moment 
Saxon was blinded. When vision re- 
turned he saw Mentor standing 
immobile, unscathed. 

“Please go back to bed,” the 
robot said, 

Saxon went back to bed. 



EXT MORNING Veen a 
brought him breakfast. She 
seemed sad, withdrawn. “Lang 
and Merl went to visit Aunt Tarsi. 
She lives near the Equator. They 
won’t be back till evening.” 
“How” Saxon had trouble 
breathing. “How did they go?” 

“By transmitter, of course.” She 
indicated a large shimmering plat- 
form in one corner. “Oh, I’m sorry. 
I forgot rovers hate the mention 
of any type of gadgetry.” Her eyes 
grew impossibly earnest. “But we 
try to achieve some kind of balance, 
really. Once when I suggested that 
Father let Mentor help him plow 
the fields, he got furious.” 

Saxon restained wild laughter. 
First the robot, invulnerable to 
atomic energy, now a matter trans- 
mitter. 

Yet they plowed their own fields. 
“Veena,” he said. 

102 



She looked up at him. 

“Why did you tell Mentor to 
keep me here?” 

She bowed her bright head. Her 
blue eyes were brimming. 

“Why, Veena?” 

“Because I like you,” she sniffled. 
“I wanted you to s-stay.” Abruptly 
she fled from the room. 

He stood bleakly looking after 
her. After a time he went outside 
and struck across the field towards 
the forest. 

This time the robot did not stop 
him. 

Do not allow the emotional 
charm of any culture, nor any indi- 
vidual of that culture, to sway your 
inhibition appraisal. 

In the narrow confines of the 
lifeboat he repeated the quotation 
grimly. Good inhibition agents are 
inflexible. He was a good agent. 

For almost an hour he fed data 
into the monitor tapes. Then he 
touched a stud and closed his eyes, 
waiting for judgment. 

“Agricultural family-group so- 
cieties are normally stagnant,” the 
monitor droned. “Such cultures, re- 
gardless of technological level, do 
not warrent inhibition of any type. 
Reference : twelfth generation 
check on Eden V.” 

The room spun. Saxon whis- 
pered, “But they have cybernetics, 
matter transmitters.” 

“Regardless o f technological 
level.” The monitor was adamant. 

This was madness. Saxon wiped 
his forehead and said, “Assuming 
geographical isolation no barrier to 
united group action in the event of 
emergency.” 

“United action is incompatible 
with family-group.” 




JAMES GAUSEY 




“Assume and advise!” 

Relays chattered. Abruptly the 
entire panel flashed crimson. The 
monitor spoke one word. 

Annihilation.^^ 

Saxon referred to his Inhibition 
handbook. He had never annihilat- 
ed a culture before. 

One hour later he went into the 
forest. Birds sang overhead. The 
sun dappled him in light and 
shadow. He stalked a small furry 
quadruped that squealed at him 
from a log and brought it down 
with his sonic pistol. 

Back in the lifeboat he watched 
the animal regain consciousness in 
an air-tight tank, and very slowly 
he pulled a lever. A green vapor 
rolled into the tank. The quadruped 
screamed. The green vapor fed. 

It was the penultimate in spore- 
dom, yet it was more than a spore. 
It had virus characteristics, and its 
propagation rate was almost math- 
ematically impossible. There was 
no known defense, and once used, 
the entire planet was forever un- 
touchable. To Saxon’s knowledge 
it had been utilized only once on 
Eden I. 

At dusk, he took the lifeboat up 
fifty miles. He released the spores 
in a widening spiral, and finally 
jettisoned the tank. He went into 
an orbit at ten thousand miles, and 
waited. 

It would take approximately a 
week. 

It was a long week. Saxon slept 
little. He paced the cabin. He 
looked at the stars and thought 
about a blue-eyed waif with tears 
in her voice, begging him to stay. 

After a week the life-boat came 
down at the edge of a grassy plain. 
Saxon took a sample of the con- 

INHIBITION 



taminated atmosphere to deter- 
mine propagation rate. 

The atmosphere was pure. 

Some freak of expansion. One 
uncontaminated spot in a hemi- 
sphere of death. 

He selected another location. 
Then another. That evening he 
close the coordinates of his original 
landing site and tested the air 
again. 

Finally he went outside the air- 
lock. He breathed deeply, and the 
air was fresh and sweet, it smelled 
of forest and cool streams and 
evening dew. In the blue dusk birds 
twittered. A small marsupial very 
much like a squirrel scampered to 
the safety of a tree and scolded him. 
Saxon began walking. 

At the edge of the forest he saw 
the familiar plowed field. The 
farmhouse was a friendly beacon 
in the twilight. 

“Hello,” Veena said. She stood 
at the edge of the forest. She was 
smiling. “Welcome home, rover.” 
For the next few days Saxon was 
the perfect guest. He argued phil- 
osophical abstractions with the 
family by firelight ; by day he hiked 
in the woods with Veena and lis- 
tened to Mentor give her lessons. 
He asked questions. 

“Veena, do you know what a 
microorganism is?” 

“Benevolent or malignant?” 
“Malignant. A plague.” 

She pursed her lips. “Organic 
or cultural?” 

“Organic of course.” 

“Bacteria.” Veena shrugged. 
“Quite a few of the first generation 
died immediately after the landing. 
Until they adapted. Until they 
analyzed the basic metabolism of 
the planet’s dominant life-forms, 

103 




and constructed a neutralizer.’’ 

“A neutralizer?” 

“A protective shell of ionized 
particles,” she said patiently, 
“keyed to the individual body- 
chemistry.” 

“Classified information,” Mentor 
droned. 

Saxon licked his lips. “You men- 
tioned cultural microorganisms?” 

“Much more deadly. I call them 
that, but Lang says I’m being se- 
mantically unsound. War, for ex- 
ample. Racial inferiority. To date 
we haven’t found a cure.” She 
broke off, and her eyes were shin- 
ing wet. 

“But you don’t have wars,” 
Saxon said. 

“No.” 

“Then?” 

“We have a — ghetto,” the girl 
said slowly. “I can’t tell you about 
it. Perhaps soon — ” 

Abruptly she changed the sub- 
ject. 

Slowly, Saxon’s defenses began 
to crumble. 

To all intents he was now a 
member of Lang’s household, 
Veena’s adopted big brother. 

Big brother — or pet? 

It did not really matter. 



O N THE fourth day he went 
back to the lifeboat. He re- 
membered his graduation day, the 
crash of the Corps anthem, and 
the pledge. 1 do faithfully swear to 
uphold the ideals of Man, to use 
this vested power for the absolute 
good of Earth. 1 will not shrink 
from any cup of duty, regardless 
of how bitter. 1 will guard stasis 
with my life, and the lives of in- 
nocent people if need be, people 

104 



whose only crime may be that they 
are potential threats to stasis — 
He tinkered with the ship’s re- 
actor for an hour. Then he ran. 

Behind him the lifeboat dis- 
solved in a white blossom of flame. 

Farewell the cold stars and the 
ache and the loneliness. Farewell 
the destruction of newborn colonies 
to secure the rotting stagnancy of 
Earth. 

He would have a great many bad 
nights, but he was used to bad 
nights. He thought of Veena and 
his stride quickened. She would be 
a beautiful woman. 

They were waiting for him back 
at the farm house, Lang, Veena 
and Merl. They were staring at the 
dark pyre of smoke in the forest. 
Saxon took a deep breath and 
squared his shoulders. “I’ve got a 
confession to make — ” 

They weren’t listening. Lang 
said quietly, “You were right, 
Veena. He may qualify.” 

“Come.” Merl took her husband’s 
arm. “Let’s call the Council.” 
They went inside. Saxon looked 
at Veena. He moistened his lips. 
“You knew,” he said. 

She nodded. There was a queer 
adult maturity about her as she 
said, “Wait. They’re calling an 
emergency Council meeting to de- 
cide if you’re fit.” 

“Fit,” Saxon said. Coldly, it 
seeped in. To survive? To be a 
playmate, a slave? “It’s been a 
game,” he said, grasping her 
shoulders. “You’ve known all 
along.” 

“They’re taking the transmitter 
to the Landing Site now,” she 
said. “Would you like to watch?” 
Watch judgment of the outcasts 
on one of those who had marooned 



JAMES CAUSEY 




them? Why not? 

Lang and Merl were no longer 
in the house. Veena touched a 
silver stud in one comer, and one 
side of the room dissolved from 
a vista of golden wheat to a grassy 
amphitheatre. There were people 
assembled in the clearing. Lang 
and Merl stood on a mossy dais, 
making a speech. 

He saw the ship. 

It was a giant silver ovoid, fret- 
ted with strange vanes, pockmarked 
by the red cancer of rust. Tower- 
ing forest patriarchs guarded that 
ship like a woodland shrine. A 
ship that had never been born on 
Earth. An alien ship. 

Understanding came, and a 
quiet horror. 

He lurched away from the 
screen, away from Veena. He was 
outside now, and running. He was 
a good Inhibition agent, he had 
been conditioned to the shock of 
alien concepts for half his lifetime, 
but the ground reeled beneath him 
as he ran and he could feel the hot 
trickle of blood where he had bit- 
ten through his lip to keep from 
screaming. 

Aliens. 

From oidside. 

Homo Superior, treating his ape- 
brother with an hospitable con- 
tempt. Playing their inscrutable 
game. 

The lifeboat came down almost 
in front of him. 

It came down with a whining 
snarl and settled into the plowed 
field. The airlock opened. Primus 
Gant stepped out. His blue eyes 
were very cold and he was smiling. 

“Report, Commander.” 

Years of conditioned reflex 
brought him erect, made him 

INHIBITION 



whisper, “Mission unsuccessful.” 
He swayed, almost fell. Gant held 
him. 

“Easy, lad. We got the blowup a 
few minutes ago. It took us awhile 
to home in on the distress trans- 
mitter in your utility kit.” He 
chuckled at Saxon’s blank stare. 
“Whenever an agent’s ship is de- 
stroyed his utility belt automat- 
ically functions as a distress sig- 
nal.” 

Saxon shook his head painfully. 
“You’ve been waiting?” 

“We started ten days ago when 
your monitor gave out with the 
annihilation alarm.” He eyed Saxon 
keenly. “Just how bad is it?” 

Saxon told him. Gant’s face 
turned a dirty white. 

“Aliens,” he said thickly. “They 
probably murdered the original 
colony. You’ve come through 
nicely, lad. It may mean promo- 
tion.” He turned into the ship. 
“Come^ on.” 

“Wait.” Saxon’s voice was a dry 
whisper. “You’re not going to — ” 

“Demolition,” Gant said. “I’ve 
got a task force up there that can 
crack a planet. Let’s go, Com- 
mander.” 

I will not shrink from any cup of 
duty — 

“Please,” Saxon said huskily. “I 
don’t believe they’re inimical to 
Man. They’re altruists.” 

“So?” 

“They’re benevolent,” Saxon 
pleaded. “Both races can live to- 
gether!” 

“Don’t be a fool,” Gant grunted, 
and turned into the airlock. 

Saxon leapt. 

One palm came down hard at 
the base of the Director’s skull.

The York Problem 

Warfare, diplomacy, art, music, science, religion — have all 
failed to secure peace for the world. But still there is hope 
for Mankind. Another experiment remains: change the color 
line — and let’s see what happens . 

BY HERBERT D. KASTLE

T hey sat around the table, 
thirteen men dressed in the 
prescribed blue of their office. They 
spoke quietly, without tension, and 
they all seemed alike. Commis- 
sioner Dobu summed up this meet- 
ing of the Earth Council of Pre- 
vention and Correction of Non- 
Conformity. 

‘Tt is to be regretted,” he said, 
“that the juvenile deliquency prob- 
lem remains unsolved in York. It 
is also to be noted, and included 
in the local reports of the sector 
captains, that the problem has ex- 
isted some six hundred years, since 
3046, speaking in general figures. 
Therefore, the fault lies not with 
us — though this point is to be 
hinted at rather than stated per se. 
Peaceful Sirs.” 

The council members accepted 
his aside, with brief nods and 
briefer smiles, for the problem of 
York was nothing to smile at. 

Dobu cleared his throat and 
continued. “Since the Federated 
Galactic Bill of Inherent Human 
Rights forbids psychiatric treat- 
ment or syndromic surgery against 
an individual’s wishes, and since 
the people of York under the fa- 
natic tutorship of their church mas- 
ters consider psychiatry a sacrilege, 
there is no easy solution — no hu- 
mane solution. But people who have 
refused all advice, aid and educa- 
tion for six hundred years no longer 
deserve humane treatment. There- 
fore, as we have done on so many 
other occasions, and as has been 
done by our predecessors, we pre- 
sent what we feel is the only so- 
lution. Namely, that York as a 
community, and the people of York 
as a whole, be eliminated in what- 
ever manner the Federated Gal- 



actic Council sees fit. Sterilization 
appears to be the method most 
suitable. But even euthanasia would 
not be out of order.” 

Mala Wang yawned as she read 
the commissioner’s report. It was 
like all the others she’d sent to Gal- 
actic Council in the four years she’d 
been with the CPCNC. And noth- 
ing had ever happened; not unless 
you counted the Report-Received 
flashes. 

She inserted a fresh strip into 
the feeder, worked the keys effi- 
ciently, and began sending. “Fed- 
erated Galactic Council, Centauri 
Two, Code CPCNC-Earth. Most 
Peaceful Sirs: In the meeting of 
July, 3646, the problem of York, 
its adult inhabitants, and more 

particularly its juvenile delinquents 
>> 

Some forty minutes later, she 
was finished. She shut off the 
feeder, opened the ejector, and 
waited. Before she’d finished buf- 
fing the nails on her left hand, the 
ejector began clicking. “Report Re- 
ceived” emerged on the tape. Mala 
shrugged and pushed back her 
chair, but another series of clicks 
stopped her. 

“Urgently request operator stand 
by for results emergency session, 
Federated Galactic Council, being 
called at this time. Business: Con- 
tinuing reports of CPCNC-Earth 
on York Sector.” 

Mala stared at the tape, and 
slowly her eyes grew wide and her 
lips parted. Then she threw the 
inter-departmental switch and rang 
Commissioner Dobu. As soon as 
Dobu’s face materialized on the 
screen, she said, “Peaceful Sir! I’ve 
just received a message that indi- 
cates the Galactic Council is go- 



107 




ing to take action on your reports!” 
A half-hour later, the Earth 
Council of Prevention and Cor- 
rection of Non-Conformity was 
reconvened, waiting for the Ga- 
lactic Council’s decision. They were 
all wondering whether it would be 
sterilization or euthanasia. 



J OHN STEVENS was irritable. 

He’d been that way for weeks 
now, or was it months? Anyway, 
life was getting to be a foul-blooded 
pain! 

He saw the empty can, kicked it, 
watched it bounce along the 
cracked pavement. When it stopped 
bouncing, he was again faced with 
his problem: What to do on a hot 
July afternoon? 

He considered going down to 
Frank’s Vizio Palace, but decided 
against it. Not that he was afraid 
of the Sinais, but it was too hot to 
invade enemy territory alone. Be- 
sides, he had brained all this 
month’s vizios and new ones 
wouldn’t be in for at least a week. 
So he leaned against the tenement’s 
warped wall and looked for more 
cans to kick. On a day like this, he 
thought, a kid could almost wish 
vacation was over and school back 
in operation. 

Then he saw Pete Smith and 
waved a languid hand. “How’s the 
pure-blood?” he asked. 

“Living,” Pete answered. “And 
I can see Mr. Aryan’s doing all 
right for — ” 

Both froze as the patrol bubble 
turned the corner on racing treads 
and pulled up short. John con- 
sidered making a run for it, but 
saw it was too late. Pete had 
arrived at the same conclusion. 



“They picked our lips on the 
vocal-box,” Pete whispered. “We’re 
in trouble.” 

John didn’t have a chance to 
answer. The two Blasts were out of 
their bubble and coming toward 
them. The tall one said mechani- 
cally, “Section twenty-seven. Earth 
Ordinances, using profane language 
on public lanes. Subsection twelve, 
covering classification of terms of 
racial-superiority as profanity due 
to its negation of established fact 
and the harmful effects — ” 

“Oh, shove it. Blast,” Pete mut- 
tered. “We know the public scroll. 
So you picked us up on the box. So 
what?” 

The CPCNC officer looked at 
him. “You people never will learn. 
Why don’t you accept the status 
quo, learn to live like human be- 
ings?” 

“That’s what I always say,” John 
murmured sarcastically. 

The Blast stepped in and slapped 
him, hard. John rocked back on his 
heels, clenched his fists, but did 
nothing. The Blast slapped him 
again, not quite so hard but with a 
great deal more deliberation. John 
bit his lip and dropped his eyes. 

“Yeah,” he said. “Why don’t 
we act like human beings!” 

The second Blast, a shorter, heav- 
ier man, waved his companion 
away. “Easy, Farn. Don’t let this 
Yorker get you.” He turned to the 
two adolescents, something like pity 
in his brown eyes. “We’ll let it 
pass, this time. But we’ve got you 
down on our photopads. The 
next offense means Re-education 
House.” 

Neither boy said a word, but 
John’s cheek burned. and something 
in his chest burned even more.

HERBERT D. KASTLE 




The conciliatory Blast hesitated; 
then said, “Why don’t you boys 
come down to Composite Youth 
Center? We’ve got the latest vizios, 
athletic — ” 

“We’re members of Race- 
Through-God,” John said, a quiet 
satisfaction in his voice. “The scroll 
says we can’t be forced to attend 
CYC. Our master told us that. We 
go to meetings regularly.” 

Fam, the Blast who had slapped 
John, whirled around and stamped 
back to the bubble. “C’mon, Stan!” 
he called. “This filthy slum sickens 
me! 

Stan nodded, but lowered his 
voice to a confidential murmur. 
“You’ll never get out of York, be 
issued a space visa, or do anything 
worth while if you stick to the race- 
church stuff, boys. You don’t know 
what the Galaxy is like — the 
planets, the beautiful cities. It’s 
really something. Just sign up for 
CYC. After that, you can qualify 
for Integration and meet some real- 
ly beautiful ladies.” 

“We got our own ladies,” John 
said, sullen and irritated. And his 
emotions bothered him. He should 
be enraged, after the slaps and 
sacriligeous lecture; not irritated. 
“We don’t want Integration.” 

Stan shrugged wearily. “All right. 
So you’ll stick in this archaic hole, 
and eventually try to kill one of us, 
and end up on a euthanasia table. 
And one day the Galactic Council 
will get fed up and clean out the lot 
of you.” He turned to the bubble, 
speaking over his shoulder. “Watch 
your steps. Any gang fights, steal- 
ing, or profanity will get you six 
months. The Blasts in Re-education 
won’t slap — they’ll use electros on 
your fannies!” 

THE YORK PROBLEM 



When the bubble went down the 
street and around the corner, Pete 
spat eloquently. John was still fight- 
ing his irritation, his vast sense of 
dissatisfaction, but he spat too, and 
said, “Man, I’d love to do a carve 
on all Outsiders!” 

“John!” a shrill voice called. 
“John, you getting into trouble 
again?” 

John turned light blue eyes to 
the left and looked at the ground 
floor window. “Oh, ease up, Ma! 
Can’t an Aryan stand up to a foul- 
blood Outsider?” 

“John!” the gray-haired, prema- 
turely-old woman screeched. Her 
eyes darted up and down the street 
and her voice dropped to an intense 
whisper. “Don’t you use those 
words in public! A profanity charge 
is all we need, what with your fa- 
ther drinking — ” 

John tried to interrupt, but she 
raised her voice again and shouted 
him down. 

“Don’t you go getting into trou- 
ble, bringing those Blasts around 
bothering God-fearing folk who 
want to be left alone! It’s you 
kids that make it tough for the 
rest of us. That rabble would let 
us be if you — ” 

John rubbed his short-cropped 
blond hair in exasperation, and 
stalked to the corner. Pete followed, 
and they paused near the curb, ig- 
noring the tirade which continued 
behind them. Finally, the woman 
stopped speaking and drew her 
head back inside the window. 

The street was old, cracked In 
many places. But it didn’t matter. 
The only traffic was the ramshackle 
public snake which ran once every 
half-hour, and an occasional trans- 
port, and the Blast bubbles which 

109 




were constantly on the prowl for 
profanity, theft, attacks on Out- 
siders, and juvenile delinquency. 

“For once in a foul-blood life- 
time,” John exploded, “let’s cut a 
different caper! I’m sick of fighting 
the Sinais and Albines and Sons of 
Musso. I want Upper City, where 
we can pick up some high loot.” 
Pete’s thick jaw fell open and he 
stared at his blond, slender com- 
panion. “Upper City! But the 
Blasts—” 

“It’s a free Galaxy, ain’t it?” 
John snapped. “We’re allowed any- 
where our disks take us, ain’t we? 
So I want to travel Upper City.” 
“They’ll watch us,” Pete mut- 
tered. “Even if we could grab some 
loot, I don’t like it there. My old 
man works as custodian in a food 
vendro. I went with him a few 
times and I didn’t like it. The Out- 
siders look at us as if we smelled 
bad, and they don’t sit near when 
we’re on the snake. I tell you it’s 
tough, John. Let’s get a few of the 
boys and raid the Sons of Musso.” 
John hesitated, and then decided 
that as leader of the Adolphs he had 
to follow through on what he’d 
said. He moved into the street and 
walked casually to the snake stop. 
“If you’re jetting out, okay. But 
I don’t operate that way.” 

Pete didn’t move. “You been 
there lately?” he jeered. “You know 
what it’s like?” 

John acted as if he were too 
disgusted to answer. He’d been to 
Upper City several times, but that 
was years ago, when he was a baby 
and his mother had gone against 
the Divine-Angel-Ghurch master’s 
wishes and had him inoculated 
against cancer. Everyone was doing 
it on the sly anyway, so she took him 



for his three shots. Then she’d 
switched to the Race-Through-God 
sect, and it was like the other, only 
there the master let it be known 
he’d taken his anti-cancer shots 
like everyone else. But John didn’t 
remember much of Upper City, 
except that the people had looked 
at them with amusement and some 
contempt. He’d wondered why they 
did, but when he asked his mother 
she’d said he’d find out for himself. 

He had. The foul-blood trash! 
They had no pride. And they were 
all alike! 

He searched for a disk as the 
snake appeared at the corner. The 
jointed series of cars moved slowly 
on its tractor-like treads, turbo ex- 
haust filtering through the block- 
tube high on the engine. Each year 
it seemed to get slower, noisier, 
shabbier. 



J OHN STEPPED into car three 
as the snake stopped. He placed 
his disk in the slot, waited a mo- 
ment, then moved inside as the 
Clear buzzer sounded. He’d tried 
to fake his disk a few times, cutting 
imitations from plastic cans, but 
the auto-guard was too damn 
smart. It always rang for the Blast 
each snake carried in a little booth 
hinged to the last car. 

He found a seat near a window 
and glanced around. Not half-filled 
this early in the day. Later, when 
four o’clock came, it would be 
jammed. He turned to the window 
and watched the familiar shabby 
streets flow by. As they entered 
Sinai territory, he felt a tightening 
of the stomach muscles. But then 
he laughed and remembered he was 
on the snake, not invading. Never-

theless, when two big kids got on 
and took seats across the aisle, he 
knew a moment of fear. They were 
Sinais, all right. He’d seen the 
muscular one in a caper last win- 
ter. And they knew him for an 
Adolph. 

They exchanged glares, and John 
kept his face tough. The muscular 
Sinai took out a knife, holding it 
low so no one but John could see 
and began to run his finger over the 
blade. John reached for his own 
sticker; then stopped. He grinned 
and whistled ONE GALAXY, 
ONE PEOPLE. The Sinais didn’t 
like it. It was equivalent to calling 
them Outsiders. But their corner 
came along and they had to hop it. 
John turned back to the window. 
He’d get his sticker into that mus- 
cular one; see if he didn’t! 

“Your sister sleeps with Out- 
siders,” a soft voice murmured. 

John jerked around, and saw 
the three kids shuffling past his seat. 
They grinned at him and the soft- 
spoken one said, “You don’t like 
it, Adolph? Step off at Benito 
Street and we’ll have it out.” 

John controlled his rage. “Some 
other time,” he said, voice calm. 
“I’m capering Upper City today. 
Maybe you boys would like to de- 
clare a truce and come along?” 
They all stared at him. Then the 
one who did all the talking said, 
“Hell, he’s a foul-blood liar!” 
“Sure,” John said as they 
slumped into seats. “Follow me to 
the Split and see.” 

“Okay,” another Son of Musso 
said. “We will.” And the three of 
them grinned at him. 

John grinned back, but he felt 
far from Aryan inside. Now he 
wouldn’t be able to jet out. Now 

THE YORK PROBLEM 



he’d really have to cross the Split. 

He began to sweat, hoping the 
snake would break down along the 
route, that a Blast would stop him 
from crossing, that the Earth would 
blow up! Anything to keep from 
having to cross the Split. He knew 
now that he’d never meant to do 
it — ^just take a ride, kill some time, 
and bluff Pete when he got back. 

Ten minutes later, the Last Cor- 
ner sign lit up at car end. The three 
Sons of Musso strolled out into 
the street and waited, standing 
quietly under the eyes of the Blasts 
who were always around the dry 
river bed which separated York 
from Upper City. 

This was the Split, and John 
had to leave the car. He came out, 
walked past the three kids toward 
the span, and stopped at the gate. 
“One to Upper City,” he said, 
throat dry. 

The Blast gave him a sharp look. 
“Why do you want to go there, 
boy?” 

“Free Galaxy, ain’t it?” John 
muttered. 

The Blast shrugged, handed him 
a transfer disk, lifted the gate. John 
had a momentary surge of satisfac- 
tion as he heard the Sons of Musso 
talking excitedly behind him. It 
wasn’t every day that a kid from 
York invaded Upper City. Then he 
was at the shiny new snake and his 
stomach tightened and he was 
sweating. 

He kept walking, got on the 
fifth car, took a seat in the last 
row. He was the only passenger, but 
he’d seen others waiting in the cars 
he’d passed. Older folks. People 
who worked in Upper City, doing 
various menial tasks for the Out- 
siders. 

Ill 




When the Blast walked through 
on his way to the back-box, John 
ran to the port and looked out 
across the one-piece duralume span. 
The Sons of Musso were still there. 
Before he could make a decision, 
the snake eased forward fluidly and 
then hit high speed. 

John Stevens was frightened, but 
he composed his features and re- 
turned to his seat. He sat straight 
and tried to remember what the 
master had said about maintaining 
dignity in front of Outsiders, show- 
ing them the stuff pure-bloods were 
made of. But the words fled his 
mind as he gazed out of the win- 
dow. 

Upper City was really something. 
Wide thoroughfares lacing over and 
under each other in stop-free 
through ways. Thousands — no, miU 
lions of private bubbles rolling along 
with gaily-dressed passengers! Low, 
square, bright-looking buildings. 
Trees and grass and flowers every- 
where. And then, for one glorious 
moment, they were in Bunche 
Spaceport, the greatest on Earth! 

John drank in the huge, upright 
needles that stood gleaming in the 
July sun, waiting to blast off for 
planets where even greater cities 
and spaceports were established. If 
only he, John Stevens of York, 
could get inside one of those ships 
and go — 

Deep bitterness hit him, and all 
the irritation he’d felt for the past 
weeks was back. They don’t let us 
do anything! he thought. They keep 
us poor ; in dirt and ignorance ! 
That’s what the master had said. 
And he’d added that the Outsiders 
were afraid of Aryans. That’s why 
they persecuted them. 

John was seeing the full majesty 

112 



of Upper City now, the spacious 
walks and busy drives and sun-filled 
buildings. And he couldn’t help 
wondering why his people refused 
Integration. 

He suddenly realized that the 
car had filled with passengers, with 
Outsiders. He also realized that the 
twin seat next to his was just about 
the only one left in the jammed car. 
He felt his face stiffen, felt the 
hatred rise in his blood; and then 
the girl flounced up the aisle and 
hesitated, looking at him. She sat 
down. 

Not more than sixteen, John 
thought. Just right for him. And 
she sure was cute. Lovely golden 
skin — 

He stopped the thoughts there. 

It wasn’t right to think that way. 
The master at Race-Through-God 
wouldn’t approve. Not that John 
attended church regularly, as he’d 
told the Blast back in York. But 
still, such thoughts weren’t right. 
They smacked of Integration. 

He kept his head still, but flicked 
his eyes around the crowded car. 
They’d made another stop, and now 
Outsiders were standing. They 
didn’t seem to resent him, or, for 
that matter, pay him any particular 
attention. It was just that he felt 
different, and that made him 
angry, and that led to his standing 
up and moving to the port and 
getting off at the next corner — all 
this instead of being sensible and 
staying on the snake until it re- 
turned to the span and York. 

But even as he stepped into the 
street, he was remembering how 
that girl had looked, with her big 
brown eyes and dark hair and 
golden skin. 

He muttered, “Damned, non- 
HERBERT D. KASTLE 




Aryan, foul-blood Outsiders!” Then 
walked quickly down the street 
when he realized he’d used terms 
of racial-superiority. Getting picked 
up here for profanity wouldn’t be 
fun. He’d get six months in Re- 
education House for sure. 



I T WAS a hot, bright day and 
Upper City was clean, fragrant 
and beautiful, but John Stevens 
wasn’t enjoying himself. He was 
filled with nagging irritation, grow- 
ing angrier by the second without 
knowihg exactly why. He began to 
search the eyes of people passing 
by — well-dressed Outsiders in their 
one-piece coroplast suits, colors 
ranging through all the hues of the 
rainbow. He felt shabby in his old 
brown plasts. Those eyes seemed to 
be sneering at him. They seemed to 
be looking at him with disgust and 
contempt. 

He was about to turn around and 
go back to the snake stop, about 
to obey the warning bell that had 
begun ringing in his brain, when it 
happened. It wasn’t much, and 
yet it was the last straw — the one 
that broke the normal behavior pat- 
terns and left him at the mercy of 
his own emotions. 

A young woman, sleek and well- 
groomed, was passing with a little 
boy of about five. The child stopped 
dead on seeing John. In spite of 
himself, John stopped too. The 
child stared at John, eyes wide and 
filled with wonder. 

“Mommy!” he shrilled. “Mom- 
my, look at him!” 

The woman tried to hush her 
son, to drag him away, but the 
child eluded her grasp and danced 
back, still staring at John. “Look 

THE YORK PROBLEM 



at him. Mommy! What a funny 
color — ” 

John raised his hand as if to 
strike the child. He didn’t mean it, 
not really, but he wanted to stop 
that high-pitched voice, stop those 
amazed eyes from examining him. 
The child screamed and ran to his 
mother. The mother shrank back, 
enfolding the little boy in her arms, 
and shouted, “Help! Help me, 
please!” 

John turned and ran, almost into 
the arms of a tall Blast. He stopped, 
whirled around, and headed back 
past the woman and child. He cut 
left at the next corner, ran faster 
than ever before in his life, cut 
right, and left, and kept going until 
the breath rasped through his throat 
like liquified metal. But even as he 
ran, he was without fear. He was 
too angry now to be frightened. 
And it was anger such as he’d never 
before experienced. A sickening, 
confusing, red-hazed melange of 
emotion that had about it a night- 
mare quality. 

He had to slow down, and saw 
that it was all right. He’d lost that 
Blast, left the entire scene far be- 
hind. “Lousy foul-blooded Out- 
siders!” he panted, and at the same 
time knew that it wasn’t just the 
Outsiders. It was his mother, and 
his father, and the slum, and the 
gangs, and the poverty. It was his 
life he hated, his life he raged at. 

This then was the irritation he’d 
felt in the past weeks, now trans- 
formed by Upper City into a 
maniacal rage. 

John Stevens was leader of the 
Adolphs. John Stevens wasn’t even 
close to being the biggest or strong- 
est boy in his crowd. But he was 
the smartest. And this raw, basic, 

113 




but still superior intellect worked 
against him as he stalked the wide 
avenues of Upper City. 

A caper, he thought. He’d pull a 
big caper, return with loot, justify 
this visit, take out his anger on these 
people — these scum who had made 
his life so poor. 

Or was it his mother and father 
who had made his life poor? Was 
it the masters who had done that? 
Why had he come here when it 
brought such confusion, such pain? 

Another quick change of thought. 
He blocked everything from his 
mind but the red haze of rage; fed 
it, allowed it to grow to the point 
where it swallowed everything but 
his desire to strike back. 

He didn’t know where he was, 
where he was going, and he no 
longer saw the Outsiders. He had 
regained his wind now, and began 
walking quickly, almost running. 

It was later, much later, when 
he finally found the right street, 
and the right vendro, and the focal 
point for his hatred. Clothing. New, 
bright, expensive coroplast suits. 
Eight hundred disks and up! More 
than his father made in three 
months. More than John Stevens 
had ever seen in a lump sum. 

The street was quiet, empty of 
pedestrians. He walked past the 
vendro, casing it with eyes that saw 
nothing but inner hate. Some- 
thing sane — something still resist- 
ing the never-before-experienced 
rage — cried out that he wasn’t be- 
ing smart, that he wasn’t checking 
for Blasts, that he couldn’t think 
straight enough for a caper, es- 
pecially one in Upper City. But he 
was back at the vendro now, and 
he was going inside. 

There was only the commersh, 

114 



and an old man magnetting dust 
from the floor. The commersh was 
an Outsider, naturally. But the old 
man was one of York’s folk, and 
this made John Stevens lose what- 
ever grain of caution he might have 
retained. His folk, slaving for these 
scum! 

The commersh was moving to- 
ward him, face bland, only his dark 
eyes showing something other than 
serenity at seeing a kid from York. 
“Are you sure you have the right 
— ” he began, and then gasped as 
John pulled his knife and snapped 
the eight-inch blade free of the 
haft. 

John pressed the blade against 
the Outsider’s stomach and said, 
“Five suits, the best, and I’m with 
you every foul-blood inch of the 
way!” 

“Don’t, son!” the old man said 
from the side. “Get out before — ” 

John half-turned his head, and 
then felt the numbness strike his 
body. He stood there, completely 
rigid for a moment, and then found 
he could breathe and move his lips 
and shift his eyes. The commersh 
stepped back, pressed a red button 
on the counter. 

“You Yorkers must be insane,” 
he said mildly. “Do you think we 
haven’t got adequate protection 
against criminals of our own group, 
not to say such pitiful amateurs as 
you? I can paralyze a whole vendro 
full of people with this little orna- 
ment on my wrist.” He showed John 
the metallic strap and small case. 
“It’s six months Re-education 
House for you.” 

The old man shuffled closer, 
peered at John, said, “The Blasts 
will be here soon. You can talk. 
Tell me your name and I’ll get 

HERBERT D. KASTLE 




word to your folks and your master. 
Maybe they can help.” 

The rage was so strong now that 
John barely heard the old man. He 
was screaming inside, bellowing in- 
sane things that couldn’t get 
through his rigid throat. But the 
words, “You can talk,” penetrated, 
and he calmed himself. 

He tried hard, and squeaking 
sounds came through his lips. He 
shaped the words, and then had 
nothing to say. There wasn’t any- 
thing bad enough, anything that 
could hurt this Outsider, anything 
that could penetrate his shield of 
superiority. 

And then he remembered the 
ancient word, the forbidden word, 
the cardinal sin that meant death 
if used. He’d heard it one night 
when his father had gotten hold of 
enough medicinal prychol for a long 
drunk, and had ranted and raved 
against the Outsiders. 

“Nigger!” John screamed. “Nig- 
gers, all of you! Billions of foul- 
blood Niggers! Planets full of lousy 
Niggers! All alike! All brown! 
Only we are white! Only we are 
pure-bloods! Only we aren’t Nig — ” 

The paralysis intensified, every- 
thing stopped, he couldn’t breathe, 
he wanted desperately to breathe. 
And, more than that, in a final in- 
stant of clarity, he wanted to say 
that it was all a mistake — every- 
thing he’d said, everything he’d 
thought, everything he’d lived by. 
He too would be a golden brown, 
like the billions of others. It was 
his own folk who were the out- 
siders, but it wasn’t their fault 
either. It was the fault of those few 
thousand who’d refused Integration 
when all the rest of Earth’s popula- 
tion had decided on mixed breed- 



ing as a solution to human conflict. 
And that was six hundred years 
ago, and the cults had formed in 
York, and no one knew how to 
break the pattern of hatred, envy 
and fear. 

But he was falling into a long 
tube that had no light and had no 
end. 

That girl on the snake, that love- 
ly girl with the sweet smell and soft 
eyes and golden skin, that composite 
of all the white, black, brown, yel- 
low and red races of Earth would 
never be his. The space ships and 
wonderful planets would never be 
his. Never, he thought, because I 
am dead. 

He was wrong. He wasn’t dead. 
He opened his eyes later and 
vomited and was then hauled to his 
feet and stripped and given fresh 
clothing. He was taken by two Out- 
siders — only he didn’t think of them 
that way any more, only used the 
term because he had no others — 
was taken by them to a white room 
and pushed inside and left there 
alone as the port slid shut. 

A voice spoke from the smooth 
white walls. “CPGNG-Earth urges 
you to accept psychiatric treat- 
ment.” 

“No,” John said automatically. 
He didn’t want his brain touched. 
There were stories told by the 
masters — 

The voice spoke again. “Very 
well. You have used the term of 
utmost profanity to villify a citizen 
of Upper Gity. The Galactic Scroll 
calls for a penalty of death. How- 
ever, because of your youth, and 
probable syndromic history, the sen- 
tence is reduced to ten years in Re- 
education House. Have you any- 
thing to say?” 



THE YORK PROBLEM 



115 




John fought not to cry out. Ten 
years! That was worse than death! 
Six months was enough to break a 
man, and ten years would drive him 
mad. 

He’d wanted to say he was ready 
for CYC. He’d wanted to say he 
was anxious for the time when he’d 
be eligible for Integration, when 
he’d be sent to another part of 
Earth and allowed to mingle with 
the golden-skinned people and so 
lose his hatreds, fears and tensions. 
But now he couldn’t. Because it 
wasn’t a matter of free choice any 
longer. It was an escape from ter- 
ror, from ten years in hell. 

Later, he was told that this room 
would be his home for the next ten 
years. He didn’t answer the unseen 
voice, nor touch the food that was 
given him through the minor-port. 
He decided he would use the only 
means of escape men had ever 
found in Re-education House. He 
would starve himself to death. 

He meant it. 



I N THE council room not far 
away, the thirteen members of 
CPCNG-Earth were considerably 
more subdued. They’d had an hour 
of waiting, and an hour of thinking. 
Each was now wrestling with his 
conscience, wondering what por- 
tion of responsibility was his in the 
coming decision. Of course, every- 
one in the Galaxy agreed that 
York’s eight hundred thousand resi- 
dents had to be eliminated since 
they were incorrigible race-god fa- 
natics. But now that the moment 
was almost at hand, sterilization 
seemed quite drastic, and euthana- 
sia — 

To a man, they looked up as 

116 



Mala entered the chamber. “Most 
Peaceful Sir,” she began, stopping 
before Commissioner Dobu’s chair. 
But Dobu snatched the transcrip- 
tion from her hand, mumbled over 
the code-identification and formal 
introductions, and read the meat of 
the report in a voice that trembled 
only slightly. 

“After years of work, our scien- 
tists on Centauri Two have pro- 
duced the answer to the York prob- 
lem. Four million units, liquid, of a 
new geneological agent is en route 
to Earth, York Sector, for immedi- 
ate administration to the white 
population. The effect produced by 
induction of this agent into the 
bloodstream will be an instan- 
taneous change of pigmentation to 
accepted norm, and subsequent loss 
of racial tension. Change is perma- 
nent, and will be transmitted to 
offspring. Administration will be 
initiated by paralysis of entire white 
population, said method to be 
launched immediately. Shipment of 
geneological agent should arrive 
Bunche Spaceport, 22 hundred 
hours, day-this-report. Within five 
days after change of pigmentation, 
population of York is to be sepa- 
rated into family units and sent to 
as many different Galactic sectors 
as is possible. This order applies to 
all white residents, not excluding 
those found outside of York, or 
those in re-education institutions.” 

John Stevens didn’t hear the 
shout that went up from thirteen 
relieved and delighted men. He 
was entering the second hour of his 
fast unto the death. 

He couldn’t know that he’d fail 
to complete a single day of it.

And Gant twisted. He palmed 
the younger man with two deft 
blows, throat and plexus. Saxon 
slumped, retching. Gant stood 
above him, his smile strained. 

“Amateur,” he panted. “I was 
instructing hand tactics before you 
were bom.” He took out his blaster. 
“They’ve infected you,” he said 
compassionately. “I’m sorry, lad. 
You’ll get a posthumous decor- 
ation.” 

The blaster came up, steadied. 
Then Gant stood very still, a white- 
haired statue. 

Mentor came around the ship 
and helped Saxon to his feet. 

“Destroying guests is forbidden,” 
the robot clicked. “The concept is 
irrational.” 



L ater, in the shadows of the 
farmhouse that was not a farm- 
house, Saxon watched the scout 
disappear into the sky. He turned 
towards Veena. “You’re letting him 
go?” 

“Mentor — treated him,” she said 
dreamily. “He’ll report that you 
destroyed the colony, died in the 
process, and this planet is unfit for 
further colonization. Incidentally, 
the council voted in the affirmative. 
Otherwise you’d be with Gant.” 
Aliens, playing a game with their 
ape-brother. Recognizing him at 
first glance, speaking his language, 
making him feel wanted, at home. 
Why? 

He was afraid to ask the ques- 
tion. 

“We’re on a vacation,” Veena 
said. “We’ve only been here for 

INHIBITION 



one generation. We were due to 
return almost thirty years ago, but 
we found your colony.” 

“Did you—” 

“Isolation,” she murmured. “The 
ghetto. They’re sick,” she said. “In- 
fected with the culture plague. We 
couldn’t leave them and we 
couldn’t help them.” Her gaze was 
very steady. “Until you came.” 

It came to him. Man, clutching 
at the knees of Gods, envying, striv- 
ing futilely, finally hating. 

Only Man can help Man. 

“It’s not fair, Saxon breathed. 
He took Veena by the shoulders, 
made her look at him. “I’m happy 
here. You and Lang — Merl — I’m 
just beginning to learn! Fd hoped 
that in a few years — ” 

“We are not human,” Veena 
said gently. “And our life span is 
four hundred of your years.” 

For the first time, he noticed the 
faint malformation of her ears, the 
subtle differences in facial bone 
structure. He glanced past her, saw 
Lang and Merl waiting in the door- 
way. 

“It will mean months of study.” 
she said. “You have so much to 
unlearn, to understand. They may 
reject you, sacrifice you. That will 
not matter. What does matter is 
your impact on their culture, what 
it will mean a thousand generations 
hence.” 

Diseased apes, with a touch of 
Godhood, suffering from an infec- 
tion that might be forever incurable. 
Why should he be the sacrifice? 
Who was he, to help them? 

Looking at Veena, he knew the 
answer. • • •

Tomorrow's menu may consist of 
four week old meat, six month old 
bread and vegetables that are sev- 
eral years old. Scientists working in 
atomic laboratories forecast that 
atomic radiation will keep such 
foods unspoiled without the neces- 
sity of sub-zero freezing. They’ve 
preserved such foodstuffs success- 
fully with radiation treatments. 
And though there are still draw- 
backs to using the technique com- 
mercially, they predict the day is 
coming. 

Another step forward in the ap- 
plication of atomic energy is being 
made at the nuclear reactor pile at 
Harwell, England, where they are 
using atomic radiation to vulcanize 
rubber. Oxidation is not a factor in 
this process; energy alone is re- 
sponsible for this faster change in 
the structure of the rubber. 

Students applying for entrance to 
Universities may, in the future, be 
rated by the measurement of their 
body build as well as by intelligence 
tests, aptitude tests and entrance 
examinations. Called somatyping, 
this body build typing was recently 
used to study the relationship be- 
tween physical configuration and 
mental ability in a group of Eng- 

118 



lish university students. Physical 
features, such as being muscled or 
fat or lean, were found to promote 
or handicap the efficiency of the 
mental equipment to a surprising 
degree. Such typing may give in- 
formation on academic failure and 
allied problems of mental disturb- 
ance; and performance not only in 
school, but in industry, the armed 
forces and life itself may be pre- 
dicted to some extent. 

Mineral fibers may be used for air- 
craft wings and bodies in the near 
future. A technique developed at a 
Japanese University uses materials 
such as basalt and aqueous rock to 
form these mineral “threads”. They 
are melted down and poured on a 
slit revolving disk. A fiber is formed 
through centrifugal force with the 
aid of a current of air. The addi- 
tion of this fiber to cement makes it 
ten times stronger than steel. Fur- 
ther processing — into polyester res- 
ins — could make it usable in place 
of all types of light metals. 

Pianists may soon be able to carry 
their instruments with them, with 
no more trouble than a bass player 
has. A stringless instrument which 
has an electronic tone production 
system and never needs tuning has 
been perfected. Used with ear- 
phones, no one but the player hears 
the music, but grand piano volume 
is attained by plugging the piano 
into a radio or TV set. The eighty 
pound unit has detachable, folding 
legs and can be carried quite easily 
in the back seat of a car. 

Man 5,000,000 years from now, ac- 
cording to Dr. W. M. Krogman of 
the University of Pennsylvania, will 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 




be the product of an evolution di- 
rected by the science of genetics. 
The brain will be highly improved 
so that each mind will be both a 
sending and receiving set of direct 
thought communication. The span 
of life will be between 120 and 160 
years, and all of life will go at a 
much slower pace. Less muscular 
activity and a lessening of the oxy- 
gen in the atmosphere (which is 
going on even now) will make 
man burn up his food more slowly, 
in order to adapt to the change. 
Man will be a well adapted biped, 
with hands able to fashion more 
detailed intricate instruments of 
precision, and feet reduced to flat, 
more or less circular bases for legs 
which are no more than pedestals 
for the trunk and head. 

Ultrasonic waves of a frequency of 
1,000,000 cycles a second, fifty 
times higher than the highest audi- 
ble pitch, are the latest idea for 
operations requiring precise sur- 
gery. The beam is sent through a 
salt solution in contact with both 
sound source and the brain tumor 
or diseased tissue. With a precision 
far beyond the surgeon’s knife, it 



destroys an area as small as one- 
twentieth of an inch in diameter 
without affecting tissue around, 
above or beyond the immediate 
spot. Depth of the tumor or cancer- 
ous tissue within the body or brain 
will not be of any consequence 
when the tool is perfected. 

Mars has long been the planet most 
likely to bear life, but astronomers 
are now claiming that Venus is 
much more likely to be “life bear- 
ing”. The thick cloud layer sur- 
rounding our sister planet has been 
shown to have the same optical 
properties as terrestrial clouds, 
hence it is probably condensed 
water vapor. If this is so, there 
should be water over the whole sur- 
face of the planet otherwise pro- 
truding rocks would soon absorb 
practically all the carbon dioxide. 
However this hasn’t happened, for 
spectroscopic observations prove 
beyond a shadow of a doubt that 
carbon dioxide is extremely abun- 
dant in the atmosphere of Venus. 
This new picture of an ocean cov- 
ered planet, makes life on Venus 
more plausible than ever before.

When the Bible was written prophecy was an outstanding feature of this

This amazing woman predicted, long before, the coming order of 
nations in World War II. In 1943 when Russia was struggling for sur-

peace table with Russia and concede to her wishes. Only very shrewd 
maneuvering will prevent her being the completely dominant power in 
Europe.” This has come true! Now— she says— “This is the time of 
many small wars, quarrels in families and sudden home changes. 
Through it all, the United States will advance to unbelievable power 
and sound financial strength. For many, many people there will be
