T he way it can happen is like 
this: You’re leaning back in 
your first-class seat on Fat Cat 
Spacelines with a cigar in your face 
and a glass of champagne in your 
hand, going from Depredation City 
on Earth to Spoilsville Junction on 
Arcturus XII. Magda will be wait- 
ing for you just behind the customs 
barrier and the party in your honor 
will be going full swing at the Ul- 



tima Hilton. And you realize that, 
after a lifetime of struggle, you're 
finally rich, sexy, successful and re- 
spected. Life is like a ball of 
chicken liver, rich and tasty and 
dripping with grease. You’ve work- 
ed a long dirty time to get where 
you are and you’re ready at last to 
enjoy it. 

Just at this moment the landing 
sign flashes on. 



4 




You say to the stewardess, “Tell 
me, pretty one, what is going on?” 
“We’re putting down at End 
City,” she tells you. 

“But that wasn’t scheduled. Why 
are we landing there?” 

She shrugs. “That’s where the 
ship’s computer took us and now 
we have to land here.” 

“Now look,” you say sternly, “I 
was assured by my very good 
friend, J. Williams Nash, the 
President of this Line, that there 
would be no unscheduled stops.” 
“End City terminates all pre- 
vious assurances,” she tells you. 
“Maybe you didn’t want to come 
here, but you sure as hell have ar- 
rived.” 

You fasten your safety belt and 
think — just my stupid luck. Sweat 
your ass off all your life, and just 
when you’re ready to have a little 
fun, up comes End City. 

I t’s pretty easy to get into End 
City. All you have to do is show 
up. Park your spaceship in the 
junkyard. There’s nothing to sign. 
Don’t worry about a thing. Come 
around later and meet the boys. 

T he Quicksilver Kid swaggers up 
and asks, “Hey, what do you 
guys do for kicks around here?” 
Mort the Snort says, “We take 
drugs like Hope-’74.” 

“What is the effect of Hope- ’74?” 
“It makes you think you got a 
future.” 

The Quicksilver Kid looks wist- 



ful. “Man, I gotta score me some of 
that stuff.” 

M eet Sweet Lucy, girl of a 
thousand bodies, all gross. 

“1 takes myself down to the Ce- 
lestial Body Shop nearly every 
Monday and each time I’m deter- 
mined to get myself a real pretty 
body — you know the kind I mean, 
pretty. But each time it’s like this 
compulsion comes over me and I 
pick a big fat saggy number just 
like I always had. If I could ever 
lick that weirdo compulsion I’d be 
in real good shape.” 

Dr. Bernstein’s comment: “Her 
hangup is her salvation. Down 
chicks always run true to form. 
Gentlemen, kick her as you leave. 
She digs the attention.” 

G iardano had done a lot of 
traveling, but he never did get 
far. “It’s simple truth to say that 
this galaxy is just like the inside of 
my head. The farther you go, the 
less you see. Been to Acmena IV — 
looks just like Arizona. Sardis VI is 
a ringer for Quebec and Omeone 
VI is a duplicate of Marie Byrd’s 
Land.” 

“What does End City look like?” 
“If 1 didn’t know better,” Giar- 
dano says, “I’d think I was back 
home in Hoboken.” 

I n end city they have to import 
everything. They import cats and 
cockroaches, garbage bags and 
garbage, cops and crime statistics. 



END CITY 



5 




They import spoiled milk and 
rotten vegetables, blue suede and 
orange taffeta, they import orange 
peels, instant coffee, Volkswagen 
parts. Champion spark plugs. They 
import dreams and nightmares. 
They import you and me. 

“But what’s it all for?” 

“That’s a stupid question. You 
might as well ask what reality is 
for.” 

“Well — what is reality for?” 

46T °°k me up any time. I live at 
J_ jOOO Zero Street, at the inter- 
section of Minus Boulevard, just 
across from Null Park.” 

“Is that address supposed to 
have a symbolic meaning?” 

“No, man, it’s just where I live.” 

N obody can afford the neces- 
sities in End City. But luxuries 
are available for everyone. Ten 
thousand tons of Chincoteague oys- 
sters are distributed every week, 
free. But you can’t cop cocktail 
sauce for love or money. 

C olloquy in Limbo Lane: 
“Good day, young man. Are 
you still caught up in the ways- 
means fallacy?” 

“Guess I am, Professor.” 
“Thought as much. Good day, 
young man.” 

“Who was that?” 

“That was the professor. He al- 
ways asks about the ways-means 
fallacy.” 

“What does it mean?” 



“Don’t know.” 

“Why don’t you ask him?” 
“Don’t care.” 

D r. bernstein says: “Monism 
postulates that there’s only 
one thing — dualism says there are 
two things. No matter which is 
true, you still haven’t got much to 
work with.” 

“Hey!” says Johnny Cadenza. 
“Maybe that explains why every- 
thing around here tastes either like 
chili or chow mein.” 

G iardano opens a pocket note- 
book and tries to count all the 
Main Streets he’s walked down. 
Mort the Snort shoots pure Sealtest 
ice cream and waits for the hit. The 
Quicksilver Kid lays out a game of 
solitaire, but every card is an eight 
of diamonds. Sweet Lucy bites into 
a Mars Bar and tastes sunlight, taf- 
feta, a barking puppy. 

Dr. Bernstein looks back at the 
old stars, the old trips, all used up 
now, all finished. He looks ahead at 
the blackness of the gulf, the big 
leap into nothingness. He sighs, 
takes Lucy by the hand. They 
dance. 

You come hesitantly forward at 
last, clear your throat, say, “Ex- 
cuse me but this is all some kind of 
mistake,, isn’t it? I mean, I 
shouldn’t be here at all.” 

“You’re in the right place,” 
Bernstein says. “Welcome to End 
City.” He doesn’t even bother to 
laugh at you. +

He saw the truth but could 
not change it. No one could — 
except the

W hat Harris (Andrew, Lt. 

Com., USN) later referred to 
on his notetapes as “the metamor- 
phosis of my milieu” began when 
the Starquest was less than a day 
distant from her first Mars orbit. 
As was his custom, he had stepped 
into the drive room to make his 
daily inspection of the engines. The 
actual works were largely hidden 
from the eye of the beholder by 
heavy shielding and could be 
checked out realistically only by 
means of the monitor in the control 
room, but viewing the setup at first 
hand reassured Harris in a way that 
seeing it on a screen could not. This 
time around, however, he wasn’t in 
the least reassured — quite the con- 
trary. 

The drive had vanished utterly. 
In its place, lying side by side be- 
tween two huge concave braces, 
were two long cylinders that he at 
first took to be a pair of massive 
conduits but which, when he read 
the lettering on the black and gold 
surface of the nearer one, turned 
out to be a pair of alkaline Duracell 
1.5- volt batteries, size A A. 

To complete his mental devasta- 
tion, the room’s deck, ceiling and 
bulkheads had transmuted, since 
his last look-in, from steel plating 
to a green plastic material. A 
strange humming noise was ema- 
nating from below the deck, while 
an even stranger whirring sound 



was coming from beyond the stern 
firewall. 

Shaken, he backed out of the 
room, instinctively reaching for the 
door. If he could shut the insane 
scene from his sight, perhaps it 
would go away. He found himself, 
however, thwarted — for the door no 
longer existed. 

Although disliked by his fellow 
astronauts, ostensibly for a streak 
of cruelty he was not always suc- 
cessful in concealing but actually 
for his intellectualism, Harris had 
been the International Space 
Agency’s overwhelming choice for 
the first one-man Mars mission. He 
was self-disciplined, emotionally 
stable and resourceful — the sort of 
person least likely to lose his cool 
no matter how bizarre the circum- 
stances. He did not lose it now. 

After standing quietly in the 
Starquest' s aft corridor ( that had 
transmuted to plastic also, grown 
longer and undergone several other 
changes) till his heartbeat subsided 
to nearly normal, he reentered the 
drive room. The two Brobding- 
nagian batteries were lying “head 
to foot,” their positive and negative 
terminals respectively making con- 
tact with vertical metal arms pro- 
truding through slots in the deck. 
Since there was no way Harris 
could get below — at least none that 
he knew of — he had to surmise 
what sort of energy converter was 
installed there. His mind balked. 
Small wonder. How in hell could an 
electric motor powered by two 1.5- 



8 



GALAXY 




volt batteries (assuming such a set- 
up had been in effect all along) 
have freed the Starquest from the 
moon’s gravitic pull and have 
brought her to the verge of her first 
Mars orbit mere months after lift- 
off? Moreover, what means of pro- 
pulsion did the theoretical motor 
employ? 

A propeller? 

I ooking neither to left nor right, 
j he hurried forward to the con- 
trol room and homed in on the 
radio. He fumbled for the toggle 
switch. "Starquest to base — Star- 
quest to base — ” 

Then he stood there, feeling 
slightly foolish. And slightly terri- 
fied. For the control panel, of 
which the radio was a part, had 
turned into the same green plastic 
material he had seen in the drive 
room and the corridor. Not only 
that — the panel had moved. And 
the control room itself — bulkheads, 
deck and ceiling — had transmuted 
to plastic and grown larger. Or per- 
haps it only seemed larger because 
most of its more sophisticated para- 
phernalia had ceased to exist even 
in plastic form. 

Harris sagged into the control 
chair — fortunately it was still in the 
same place — and stared at the 
levers, switches, gauges, dials and 
screens arrayed before him. The 
levers and switches were realistic, 
though immovable, and the gauges 
and the dials had numbered faces 
pasted on them. When he had 



glanced at the ship’s chronometer 
some fifteen minutes ago it had 
registered 1620 hours — the printed 
face of its plastic counterpart regis- 
tered 0600 hours. Worse, he had no 
timepiece of his own to dispute it. 

He gazed at the monitor screens. 
They had pictures painted on them. 
One “showed” what looked like a 
subatomic drive, another what 
looked like a grav generator, 
another what looked like an oxygen 
reconverter, and still another an 
apparatus that vaguely suggested a 
meteor deflector. 

Harris returned his eyes to the 
picture of the oxygen reconverter. 
He took a deep breath. Another. 
The air seemed to be okay. 

At length his gaze stole over to 
the forward bulkhead where the 
viewscreen had been. It was still in 
approximately the same place. It 
had transmuted to plastic and had 
a picture of Mars painted on it. 

F or a moment deja vu over- 
whelmed him. Then he forced 
himself to check out the ship — or at 
least those parts of it that were ac- 
cessible to him — from stem to 
stern. It had been cast or stamped 
out of plastic in two lateral sec- 
tions — then the two sections had 
been fused (glued?) together. (Har- 
ris didn’t believe his eyes, but this 
was what they told him.) The ship’s 
appointments and equipment, ex- 
cept for the batteries and, pre- 
sumably, the theoretical electric 
motor, had been part of the 



TINKERBOY 



9 




original pattern — or die — from/ 
with which the two sections had 
been cast, or stamped. 

There were other differences. 
The ship had become considerably 
larger and its appointments and 
equipment, when duplicated, were 
differently styled and no longer 
located in quite the same places. 
While the control room and the 
drive cubicle still occupied approxi- 
mately the same sections, the tiny 
cabin that contained his bunk had 
exchanged places with the lock — 
and the little lavatory, formerly ad- 
jacent to his cabin, had exchanged 
places with the suit locker. 

Oddly, the new arrangement 
only served to intensify his deja vu. 
But was what he was experiencing 
deja vu? Hadn’t he, long long ago, 
in a different way, experienced all 
this before? 

Formerly the ship’s illumination 
had been supplied by strategically 
placed fluorescent tubes. Now it 
came from strategically applied 
daubs of phosphorescent paint. 
There was no longer a heating sys- 
tem — or if there was, he could find 
no evidence of it — yet the interior 
temperature was in the upper 
seventies. 

But while there was light and 
heat and air, there was no food. 
Oh, there was a galley, all right, 
but no one had thought to stock it. 
In addition to its empty shelves it 
contained a quaint little plastic 
sink and two cute little plastic 
water taps. The trouble with the 



taps was, he couldn’t turn them 
on — but even if he’d been able to 
his lot wouldn’t have been im- 
proved. A subsequent search for 
the water reservoir and the recyc- 
ling system revealed both to be no 
longer existent. 

He didn’t enter the drive room 
again — he didn’t have the heart. 
Anyway, he knew that nothing had 
changed: the humming of the hypo- 
thetical electric motor and the 
whirring of the hypothetical pro- 
peller were audible throughout the 
ship. Occasionally sounds came 
from outside the ship — distant 
muffled crashes, strange long- 
drawn-out thunderings . 

After taking an inventory of his 
clothing and the contents of his 
pockets and finding nothing chang- 
ed and everything still there, he 
returned disconsolately to the con- 
trol room. There, he sat powerlessly 
in the control chair, staring at the 
painted picture of Mars. What de- 
lightful white polar caps you have, 
my dear, he thought. What a de- 
lightful orange complexion! And 
those charming little lines that 
crisscross one another so quaintly — 
are they your famous canals? 

If only there were some way he 
could see the real Mars. If only 
there were portholes in the hull . 
But there were, weren’t there? Ten 
of them. Five on either side . 

Throughout his “tour of inspec- 
tion” — and even before — he had 
had the feeling that every aspect of 
the ship was the same as it had 



10 



GALAXY 




always been — that nothing really 
changed until he looked at it. Until 
he remembered it. Thus, while he 
was startled, he was not truly sur- 
prised when, glancing at the section 
of the starboard hull that the con- 
trol-panel abutted, he saw ... re- 
membered? ... a porthole. 

Looking through it, he saw 
“Mars.” It was the same orange 
hue as its two-dimensional sister on 
the viewscreen, had just as many 
canals, was tilted the proper degree 
on its axis and was resting on what 
appeared to be a stilt. 

Bright bluish radiance bathed it 
from above and yellowish light 
from afar. Despite its distance from 
the Starquest it seemed no more 
than a stone’s throw away. Orbiting 
it at perceptible velocities were two 
ping-pong ball-like moonlets. 
Around and around and around 
they went. 

Around and around and around. 

From his notetapes: 

“. can be but three possible 
explanations for the phenomena I 
have just described — that consti- 
tute the metamorphosis of my 
milieu: 1) the utterly absurd one 
that the metamorphosis is the 
result of a photon storm through 
which the Starquest is passing and 
of which the detectors are appar- 
ently unaware; 2) the equally 
absurd one that no metamorphosis 
occurred, that for a reason or rea- 
sons unknown to me I am perceiv- 
ing reality divested of its usual

Old business firsts a thousand and then 
some apologies to T. J. Bass for confusing 
the name of his new BB novel In the 
February ad. The real title is THE GOD- 
WHALE; Rorqual Maru is the “heroine,” 
and she's quite a gal. Hope you found it on 
sale despite our editorial boggling of the 
title. Anyway, it’s a jolly good booh and a 
delightful read. Look for it. And if all THE 
GODWHALEs have been bought up, send 
for it — you’ll love it. 

The big news of the month is UNDER 
PRESSURE, Frank Herbert’s classic sf 
novel of an incredible 21st-century energy 
crisis! Talk about relevance! When the 
book was first published (original title: 
The Dragon in the Sea back in 1955), it 
was critically acclaimed by major reviewers. 
Said The New York Times: “In this blend 
of speculation and action, Mr. Herbert has 
created a novel that ranks with the best of 
modern science fiction. Here is a sea story 
of an Imaginary war that comes very dose 
to matching — in suspense, action and 
psychic strain — any chronicle of real war by 
C. S. Forester or Herman Wouk.” 

In the world of the future that Herbert 
postulated, the U.S.A. all but used up its 
oil supply (sound familiar?). A new source 
must be found. Atomic subtugs begin 
stealing supplies from underwater deposits 
in enemy territory. Problem: none of the 
twenty tugs sent out on a mission have re- 
turned with the desperately needed oil. 
Ensign John Ramsey of BuPsych is planted 
aboard the Fenian Ram S1881 as an elec- 
tronics officer. His assignment — find the 
saboteur in the four-man crew and bring 
back the oil. The review of this novel that 
we liked best said: “This is a fictional story 
of the future that we should pray never be- 
comes a news story of the present.” 
Htnmm!

Alan Dean Foster Is writing a series of 
books set in the galaxy he originally created 
for TAR-AIYM KRANG. In ICERIGGER 
the new book, he postulates a frigid planet 
on which a party of humans Is stranded. 
They are an ill-assorted group, initially 
intent on cutting one another’s throats. 
They are rescued by a company of tran — the 
local inhabitants — and escorted through 
many adventures to the tran fortress town. 
On this iceworld, the natives move by ex- 
tending their batwings and allowing the 
violent winds to sailskate them over the 
frozen landscape. The humans are at a 
dreadful disadvantage — having no natural 
locomotion, being vulnerable to the cold 
and being totally dependent on the strange 
tran . 

With his first stoiy The Book of Rack the 
Healer (serialized in IF a while ago), Zach 
Hughes established himself as one of those 
tellers of tales whose ability to create life 
forms makes them unique. Now Hughes is 
back with THE LEGEND OF MIAREE. 
She is an Artonuee— a delicately furred, 
winged creature with great multi-faceted 
eyes. Her world seems ultimately doomed 
by a head-on collision with another world. 
But the time is far off, and the Artonuee 
hope to find a way to divert the rogue 
planet. Miaree, in her one-man space flyer, 
must save her people. Szafran has captured 
the delicate and ethereal quality of Mlaree’s 
ship in one of the most beautiful sf covers 
we’ve seen. Look for it!

ration could safely be undertaken 
by one man without his experienc- 
ing adverse side effects — that what 
I am experiencing now is a form of 
regression brought on by my sub- 
conscious to delete from my phy- 
sical awareness the awesomeness of 
my real surroundings. 

“To elaborate — when I was eight 
years old I received for my birthday 
a mini-solar system kit. Al- 
though much more sophisticated, it 
had considerable in common with 
the tinkertoy sets of my great 
grandparents’ day. Correctly as- 
sembled, its various parts formed a 
sort of extensive orrery consisting of 
a 350-watt bulb centerpiece, around 
which nine painted plastic planets 
and thirteen painted plastic moons 
(for obvious reasons, only those 
moons closest to their primaries 
were included while the asteroid 
belt was omitted altogether) orbited 
at drastically reduced distances but 
at velocities reasonably in ratio to 
their real-life counterparts. This 
was accomplished by means of nine 
flat metal arms radiating fanwise 
from a hub centered beneath the 
‘sun.’ Each planet was affixed ver- 
tically to its appropriate arm by 
means of a vertical metal rod, and 
an electric motor and a differential 
housed in the hub effected the cor- 
rect orbital velocities. The only 



12 



GALAXY 




thing lacking was axial rotation, 
but this was compensated for to 
some extent by magnetic-repellor 
cores in ‘Earth,’ ‘Mars,’ ‘Jupiter,’ 
‘Saturn,’ ‘Uranus’ and ‘Neptune’ 
that kept their respective steel- 
cored moons at fixed distances 
from their primaries and, by revolv- 
ing, lent them orbital motion. 

“Once assembled, my mini-solar 
system literally filled the basement 
recreation room where my parents 
had permitted me to build it, the 
season being summer and social get 
togethers having been transferred 
to the patio. The plane of the eclip- 
tic was some three feet above the 
floor and some four below the ceil- 
ing. At its outermost point, ‘Pluto’s’ 
eccentric orbit barely cleared the 
doorway leading to the kitchen 
stairs. Augmenting the radiance of 
‘Sol’ were four overhead fluorescent 
tubes. 

“I peopled my extraterrestrial 
planets with all sorts of weird life 
forms, but for ‘Earth’ I created a 
race of beings very much like our- 
selves and a civilization sequence 
roughly parallel to our own. After 
fabricating a history of wars, 
famines, floods, earthquakes and 
what-have-you, I crowned my little 
world with a technological civiliza- 
tion not greatly different from the 
one I lived in. I then proceeded to 
play God in earnest, raining down 
upon the helpless heads of the poor 
beings I had brought into existence 
calamities and catastrophes and 
diseases of every description. I 



created power shortages, devised 
domestic tragedies, instigated riots, 
ignited wars. In a sense, I tinkered 
with the destinies of my mini- 
humans in much the same way I 
had tinkered with the mini-solar 
system in which they lived. 

“At first, the idea of ‘spaceflight’ 
did not occur to me, although a tiny 
toy spaceship had come with the 
kit . .” 

H arris sat dozing in the control 
chair, dreaming of his wife 
and home. His wife’s name was 
Georgiana and she was like a wind 
walking, a night wind, cool and 
lovely, with night-black hair and 
evening-star eyes. Georgiana. And 
the house where they lived sat by a 
river that sang, beneath trees that 
whispered amid the golden laughter 
of lazy summer afternoons . 

Awakening, he had no idea how 
long he had slept. He was hungry 
and thirsty and he saw little black 
flecks when he blinked. His tongue 
seemed to fill his mouth. 

Clearly he had slept for quite 
some time. When he looked 
through the starboard porthole he 
saw that “Mars” and its moonlets 
were now much closer. It stunned 
him that a self-induced illusion 
could keep such perfect pace with 
reality. But on the other hand, how 
could it fail to keep pace? Illusion 
or no illusion, the plastic spaceship 
he was riding in was still the Star- 
quest, “Mars” was still Mars and 
“space” was still space. And he was

still Harris, Andrew, Lt. Com., 
USN. 

He pressed his cheek against the 
oddly resilient glass and looked 
along the line of the ship’s trajec- 
tory. He saw both “Jupiter” and 
“Saturn.” “Uranus,” “Neptune” 
and “Pluto” were apparently else- 
where in their orbits and out of 
sight. “Jupiter’s” famous marking 
was a vivid splash of crimson. “Sa- 
turn’s” rings looked as though they 
were made of aluminum foil. 
Neither had its full quota of moons: 
“Jupiter” had only four, “Saturn” 
only three. 

He crossed the control room and 
peered through the opposite port- 
hole. He saw no stars (he had not 
expected to see any) — only bluish 
radiance tinged with the wan yellow 
rays of “Sol.” And in the far dis- 
tance a vast pale blur. As he stared, 
the blur seemed to move . 

He slammed the door on the 
logical conjecture that tried to step 
into his mind and moved back 
quickly from the porthole. Shiver- 
ing, he returned to the starboard 
porthole and pressed his other 
cheek against the glass. Both 
“Earth” and the “sun” were 
hidden by the hulUHe would not be 
able to see them till Moonbase acti- 
vated the retro-rockets in the Green 
Avenger’s — the Starqnest's — prow 
and the ship went into orbit. The il- 
lusion was quite strict about such 
matters. 

From his notetapes: 



“Later, if there is a later in my 
life and if the veil that I have drawn 
over the face of reality dissolves, 1 
will transcribe these notes, which I 
am recording on my pocketaper, to 
the Starqnest’s log. 

“Although of necessity way out 
of proportion to the hurtling ‘ce- 
lestial bodies’ it was meant to travel 
among, the toy spaceship that came 
with my mini-solar system was a 
masterpiece in the art of miniaturi- 
zation. Delightful glimpses of its 
illuminated, incredibly detailed in- 
terior could be obtained through 
tiny saran-wrap portholes located 
at regular intervals in the plastic 
hull, and I spent hours peeking in 
on its Lilliputian control room, try- 
ing to make out the infinitesimal 
readings on the dials and gauges 
and the details of the picture 
painted, as though on the head of a 
pin, on the viewscreen. It was in- 
evitable that when the time came I 
should project myself inside — and 
just as inevitable that I should 
project myself, not as an eight-year- 
old boy, but as the full-fledged 
astronaut I intended someday to 
become. 

“The plastic material of which 
the ship was made was so feather- 
light that even with the additional 
weight of the batteries and the tiny 
electric motor, plus that of a small 
counterweight in the prow, less 
than half an ounce of heliumite had 
to be pumped into the ventral 
buoyancy tank to hold the little 
vessel aloft.

GALAXY 




“As the ‘creator,’ there was no 
real need for me to employ me- 
chanical means to explore my mini- 
cosmos. I could see all my worlds at 
a single glance and, having ‘seeded’ 
them, I knew what sort of life forms 
they contained. But there was a ro- 
mantic need and eventually it sur- 
faced. When it did I christened the 
ship the Green Avenger, located 
the remote-control box that had 
come with her and set her on a 
course for ‘Mars.’” 

H arris was certain that when 
Moonbase commenced retro- 
fire the resultant recoil would shock 
him back to reality. He expected 
braking action to begin at any 
moment. It was true he had no 
means of telling time, but his 
hunger and thirst informed him 
that close to twenty-four hours 
must have passed since he had 
looked into the drive room. More- 
over, “Mars” and its moonlets were 
now opposite the ship’s stern. 

He felt strangely light-headed 
and the black flecks he had noticed 
earlier had bred like flies. He attri- 
buted both symptoms to his near- 
exhaustion and to his hunger. To 
get his mind off both he began 
fiddling with the plastic dials and 
switches in the vicinity of the plastic 
radio, hopeful of finding the real 
switch that had to exist somewhere. 

He fiddled and he fumbled, but 
he found nothing. Abruptly he felt 
himself sway. He regained control 
of himself almost instantly. Never- 



theless, he knew that for a fraction 
of a second he’d blacked out. 

The experience opened his eyes, 
and he saw who his enemy truly 
was. It was neither hunger nor 
fatigue — it was asphyxiation. Fran- 
tically he broke off one of the 
longer control-panel levers and 
began striking it against the port- 
hole. When the “glass” gave it did 
not break, but tore. This did not 
particularly surprise him, nor did 
the life-giving air that wafted 
through the rent. Nor did the cook- 
ing — and other familiar — odors 
that the air contained. 

He kneeled for a long time with 
his nose and mouth to the opening. 
Then, to make certain his enemy 
was permanently defeated, he 
crossed to the port side and gutted 
the other porthole. Returning to 
the first, he tore out the rest of the 
“glass.” As he did so he noticed 
that “Mars” had a slightly different 
aspect. It was no longer tilted in 
quite the same direction, and its 
southern polar cap, so clearly 
visible before, was now almost out 
of sight behind the curvature of its 
southern hemisphere. 

There was only one answer: 
Without benefit of retro-fire, the 
Green Avenger had swung into her 
first Mars orbit. 

From his notetapes: 

“I am physically on board the 
Green Avenger! 

“I am physically present in my 
mini-solar system! 



TINKERBOY

“There can be no other explana- 
tion. 

“No illusion could possibly be of 
sufficient intensity to induce imagi- 
nary asphyxiation, or so impene- 
trable as to shut out the recoil of 
retro-fire. Moreover, it is incon- 
ceivable that I would even uncon- 
sciously have exchanged the 
glorious cosmos I belong in for a 
mass-produced tinkertoy affair 
built in a smelly cellar by an eight- 
year-old snotnose who enjoyed 
pulling the wings off flies. 

“I did not regress mentally to a 
former set of physical conditions — I 
returned physically to them. Not 
instantaneously but by degrees — a 
circumstance that led me to con- 
clude erroneously that I had re- 
gressed mentally. And to cloud the 
picture further, this time around I 
am playing a different role. 

“How? Why? And what will be- 
come of me when my eight-year- 
old self tires of his childish game? 

“If only there were some way I 
could apprise him that there is a 
real, not an imaginary, little man in 
his toy spaceship — a hungry, 
thirsty, frightened little man who 
wants desperately to go home! 

“But if I could — would I dare?” 

H arris was able to obtain an 
excellent view of “Earth” when 
the Green Avenger passed the 
“sunward” side of “Mars.” His 
home planet was just as he remem- 
bered her — painted a royal blue 
and stippled with white polkadots. 



Her nearness told him what he 
should have guessed long ago: at 
the most she was only a “day’s dis- 
tance” from “Mars,” and when he 
had first looked at the latter, the 
Green Avenger had only recently 
left the vicinity of the former. 

He was also able to obtain an ex- 
cellent view of the “moon” and the 
“sun.” The “moon” looked like a 
tinsely Christmas ornament. As for 
the “sun,” its radiance dazzled his 
eyes, hiding from them the stilts on 
which little red “Mercury” and 
satiny “Venus” stood. But not the 
one on which “Earth” stood. She 
looked silly standing on it. Like a 
little old lady with one leg. Harris 
caught himself giggling. 

The Green Avenger continued to 
orbit “Mars.” He estimated her 
orbital time at slightly in excess of 
one hour. His time. To the 
“creator” the one hour plus prob- 
ably amounted to a few seconds — if 
that. But Harris was involved phy- 
sically in the reality of the mini- 
cosmos. Its “creator” was not. 

The Starquest had been sched- 
uled to make three full orbits. 
Halfway through the fourth she was 
to have been launched on her 
homeward journey by a burst of 
booster fire in her stern. 

Harris tried to remember how 
many orbits the Green Avenger 
would make before she began her 
homeward journey. Try as he 
would, he could not. Worse, he 
could not remember where the boy 
Harris had sent the ship afterward. 



16 



GALAXY 




Worse yet, he could not remember 
what the boy Harris had ultimately 
done with it, or, when the novelty of 
his creation wore off, with the 
tinkertoy solar system. 

Halfway through the fourth orbit 
he saw that his hands were trem- 
bling. He tried to stop them, but he 
couldn’t. When the Green Avenger 
began her fifth orbit he heard 
someone laughing loudly close 
beside him, but he didn’t look to 
see who it was. A distant crash 
reached his ears through the torn 
porthole. He didn’t look to see 
where that came from either. He 
could smell boiled cabbage, stale 
cigar-smoke and old shoes. 

Upon completing orbit number 
five, the Green Avenger continued 
blithely on into orbit number six. 
Whoever was laughing beside 
Harris began laughing even louder. 

From his notetapes: 

“What — what did I do with the 
ship? 

“Did I throw it out with the ordi- 
nary trash to be picked up and re- 
cycled? 

“My God! Didn’t I know there 
was a little man in it? 

“And how long did I keep it in 
orbit around ‘Mars?’ How long? 
How long? How long? 

“And my tinkertoy solar sys- 
tem — what did I do with that? 

“Oh, God! I can’t remember!” 

N ear the end of orbit number 
seven, Harris picked up the

plastic lever he had used to gut the 
control room portholes and ran 
with it down the corridor to the 
drive room. He was quite mad. 
Entering the cubicle, he inserted 
the lever between the face of one of 
the batteries and the corresponding 
contact arm and pried for all he 
was worth. 

The lever broke, catapulting him 
to the deck, but not before the arm 
bent and contact was permanently 
severed. 

Gasping, he got to his feet and 
looked through the drive room 
porthole. A single glance apprised 
him that he had achieved his pur- 
pose, insane though it may have 
been. The Green A venger was drift- 
ing slowly away from “Mars.” 

He listened. The humming and 
whirring noises were no more. 

A look through another porthole 
told him of yet another develop- 
ment: a second, smaller blur had 
begun to protrude horizontally 
from the vast pale haze he had 
noted earlier, that had seemed to 
move. He remembered then what 
the boy Harris had done with the 
ship. When, on its maiden voyage, 
it had inexplicably ceased to re- 
spond to the remote-control signal 
he had been transmitting he had 
grabbed it out of midair and, in a 
fit of boyish anger, had thrown it 
into the “sun.” 

The ship had split in half and he 
had never bothered to glue it back 
together. Nor had he bothered to 
replace the shattered “sun.” Al- 



ready bored with his mini-cosmos, 
he had torn it down one day and 
gone on to a new boy. Ultimately 
both the system and the ship had 
been given, or thrown, away. 

With the memory came a cold 
clearness of thought and an instant 
later the truth — or as much of it as 
Harris would ever know — burst like 
a nova in his brain. 

From his notetapes: 

“Causality! 

“It was there all the time but I 
couldn’t see it because I thought of 
it in terms of chronological time 
and conventional space. 

“I know now that it is indepen- 
dent of both — that, like the velocity 
of light, it is a constant — a constant 
that bends all else to its will. 

“I am in the Green Avenger 
because I put myself here. 

“And I am about to throw it into 
the ‘sun’ because I caused it to go 
out of control. 

“Cause and effect . 

“Unknowingly, I initiated a 
cycle, a cycle that in one sense took 
years to complete itself, in another 
minutes, and perhaps in a cosmic 
sense, no time at all. 

“There is a strong chance that in 
so doing I made my becoming the 
first astronaut to undertake a solo 
Mars mission inevitable. That I do 
not know. But I do know this: the 
cycle is completed. Hence, I shall 
return momentarily to the Star- 
quest. To real space. To the vast,

tally beautiful solar system I so 
flagrantly desecrated with my pica- 
yune imitation. 

“God! It will be good to be home 
again!” 

H arris wasn’t worried about 
the hand. It would be hours — 
his time — before it reached its des- 
tination. 

He sat down in the drive room 
doorway and fixed his eyes on 
where the subatomic drive would 
soon appear. And after what 
seemed an eternity, it did appear, 
and the 1.5 volt batteries reluc- 
tantly faded away . And one by 
one, the six white mice turned back 
into resplendent coursers, and 
finally the pumpkin turned back 
into a coach. 

He hurried forward to the control 
room. Entering, he dropped to his 
knees before the viewscreen and 
looked reverently down the black, 
star-bordered paths of space. He 
saw the red and the gold and the 
blue star-flowers, and the huge 
orange rose of Mars. He realized 
that he was crying. 

He did not get up for a long 
while. When he did so his eyes 
sought the ship’s chronometer. It 
confirmed what Mars’ position had 
already told him: despite his inani- 
tion, despite his dehydration, de- 
spite his nerve-racking tour of duty 
aboard the Green Avenger, no time 
had elapsed between his departure 
and his return. 



He had surmised as much. It 
made no difference in any case. He 
was too glad to be back to care. 

H e was still glad to be back 
when he learned, after his in- 
ternationally celebrated return to 
Earth, that his wife was terminally 
ill. Georgiana. (Ah love, let us be 
true to one another for . she 
whispered before she died.) He was 
still glad to be back when, early in 
the following spring, floods de- 
stroyed his home. He was still glad 
when the business in which he had 
invested all his savings after he re- 
tired, went bankrupt. He was still 
glad when a contretemps in an ob- 
scure African nation caused world- 
wide repercussions that ultimately 
ignited World War III. Even when 
the first bomb fell Harris continued 
glad. Only with the second did he 
begin to have doubts. When the 
third one fell he thought he saw a 
boyish face in the sky. At first he 
thought it was his own of long ago, 
but he knew instantly that it was 
not. The forehead was too wide, the 
mischievous eyes too far apart, the 
rosebud mouth too full. The vision 
faded swiftly as the colossal rod 
holding Earth aloft collapsed and 
she went plunging down to the 
cosmic cellar floor to break into a 
million pieces. The sun went out, 
and all was darkness then (though 
Harris never knew it) and the smell 
of boiled cabbage, stale cigar- 
smoke and old shoes. *

ENDANGERED 

SPECIES 



Who needs Spokelspuks, anyway? 



R. A. LAFFERTY 





£ £■« "wj hat do you know about the 

WSpokelspuk?” Benoni Lam- 
bert asked. Lambert was director of 
the Species Conservation Bureau. 

“Is the Spokelspuk an endan- 
gered species now, Benny?” Agata 
Scampo asked him. 

"What is the present head count 
on them?” her husband, Conrad, 
wanted to know. “Do we have a 
head count?” 

Conrad and Agata were not in as 
perfect accord as they once had 
been. Certain misbehaviors had 
ruffled and rippled the clear sur- 
face of their relationship. But they 
were still in wordless and almost 
telepathic understanding with one 
another. 

Conrad now called soundlessly to 
Agata, What in peristaltic perdition 
is a Spokelspuk?" 

And Agata was forced to answer 
him just as soundlessly, I don't 
know either. 

That was bad. When you are the 
ace team in the species-preserving 
business you cannot afford to admit 
ignorance of anything. 

“No, we do not have an accurate 
head count,” Director Lambert ad- 
mitted. “The reason is that it is 
difficult for a layman (and we can- 
not have experts everywhere) to 
make a sure identification.” 

“Like the Ruffled Yellow-Head 
Duck,” said Conrad. 

“That was so often mistaken for 
the Morgan’s Merganser by the ig- 
norant,” said Agata. 

“Yes, this is the same sort of 



thing.” Lambert spoke sadly. “Both 
the Spassenspuk and the Spottel- 
spuk have been falsely identified as 
the Spokelspuk.” 

“I can see why, Ben.” 

“1 can’t,” Lambert confessed. 
"They’re really not at all alike ex- 
cept in appearance, and this is one 
case where appearance is meaning- 
less. But our so far uneducated 
guess is that there are now fewer 
than thirty of the Spokelspuks left 
in the world.” 

“How about the Trondheim dis- 
trict of Norway?” Conrad asked. 
This question had stood him in 
good stead many times before. No 
one seemed to know anything much 
about Norway. 

“No, there couldn’t be any in the 
Trondheim district,” Lambert told 
him with thin patience. ‘‘The 
Trondheim is a sod-house region.” 
“Of course. I wasn’t thinking.” 
Conrad confessed lamely. 

"I don’t presume to tell you two 
how to go about your survey and 
implementation,” Lambert said. 
“You are clearly the best team we 
have. Draw ordinary funds from 
the bursar. For extraordinary 
funds, as always, make applica- 
tion to the committee. That is it, 
folks. We’d like to have a report 
with recommendations within a 
month. We would really like you to 
effect a population increase in the 
Spokelspuk within that month.” 
“We may just do that, Benny,” 
Agata told him. “We have some 
forceful ideas along that line.” 



ENDANGERED SPECIES

“One thing, before you leave. I 
have a very rare tape of the Spokel- 
spuk. Be warned — the sound it 
makes jangles the nerves of even 
the most steady.” Lambert set the 
tape to play. 

At first came a cranky murmur. 
Then a snuffling as of some crea- 
ture drawing in windy breath for a 
great endeavor. Then came the 
inimitable, unhinging sound itself. 

It began as a scream. It was 
followed by a heart-freezing clatter 
and a laugh that curdled all the 
juices of the body. It was a mockery 
that sucked all the marrow out of 
the soul, it was a shriveling de- 
rision, a cruel gloating gobble that 
brought one to absolute desolation, 
to the ragged despondency that is 
just short of death. A laugh like 
that should not have been allowed 
in hell. 

“That is the sound of the male 
Spokelspuk,” Lambert whispered 
with a shudder. “The tape, thank- 
fully, doesn’t quite do it justice.” 

“Yes, I’ve always found it an un- 
nerving sound,” Conrad lied easily. 
He looked quite shaken. 

“The sound of the female is 
worse,” Lambert said. 

“Good for the female,” Agata 
exclaimed with a sick smile. “Of 
course it’s a little hard to worry 
about the Spokelspuk’s being en- 
dangered. It really should be extir- 
pated, a thing that laughs like 
that? We have this special rescue 
and revival job to do, though, and 
we will do it. We are professionals.” 



“Of course,” said Lambert, 
knowing that they were stalwart 
and dependable. “Of course.” 

C onrad and Agata left. They 
stopped at the bursar’s and 
drew ordinary funds just short of 
the extraordinary limit. Tomorrow, 
after they had thoughtfully studied 
the situation, after they had (to be 
truthful about it) found out exactly 
what a Spokelspuk was, they would 
decide how extraordinary should be 
the funds they would ask for. The 
stickiest deals paid most. To save 
from extinction something that 
laughed like the Spokelspuk ought 
to pay well. 

“It has to be either a bird or a 
human,” Conrad said as they 
entered the working phase of their 
program. “Nothing else could laugh 
like that.” 

“And we’ve never had a call to 
preserve a human species from ex- 
tinction.” Agata set in that piece of 
the puzzle. “There are a few I 
wouldn’t want to save, the Sandy 
Sue species for instance. But I be- 
lieve the Sandy Sue is in no danger 
of becoming extinct. She’s too 
common for that.” 

“Now you are casting reflections 
upon my taste,” Conrad said 
stiffly. 

Sandy Sue was a young lady in 
whom Conrad had shown much 
interest. Actually Conrad showed 
interest in many young ladies, but 
Sandy Sue had become a type of 
this activity in the mind of Agata.

GALAXY 




££ are you two looking for me?” a 

/\. buxom and pink-haired lady 
asked Conrad and Agata. She 
followed them out to the street. 
There was something unreal about 
her, pleasantly unreal. She looked 
like a younger member of some en- 
dangered older species. 

“Madam Hexe, we have abso- 
lutely no use for a discredited 
medium,” Agata said. 

“But I divine things,” Madam 
Hexe said. “I divine things es- 
pecially by physical contact.” 

“And what do you divine now?” 
Conrad asked. 

“That you need me. That you 
have just received a well-paying as- 
signment and that you have no idea 
how to go about doing what you 
must. I want to cut myself in. I can 
do the job for you that nobody else 
can.” And, in the process of divin- 
ing by physical contact, Madam 
Hexe placed strong arms around 
Conrad. 

"Enough of that,” Agata said. 

“I’ll follow you around until you 
realize that you really do need me,” 
Madam Hexe said. “My pay — por- 
tal to portal, you know — has al- 
ready started, but we can settle 
after you come to appreciate my 
true worth.” 

The Scampos ignored the 
medium then — at least Agata did. 
But she still followed them in the 
street and Conrad sometimes did 
drop back into her friendly arms. 

“I’m still shaking from that 
Spokelspuk laugh,” Conrad said. 



“From the male Spokelspuk. And 
they say that the laugh of the fe- 
male is even worse.” 

“I have to hear that,” Agata 
said. “I have a feeling that there is 
a female Spokelspuk in my future. 
And I just believe — ah — I bet that 
the female Spokelspuk’s laugh is 
the last laugh.” 

They went to see their favorite 
ornithologist. Madam Hexe still 
followed them and seemed deter- 
mined to wait for them outside the 
bird-man’s gracious home studio. 

“You really do need me,” she 
said. “A bird the Spokelspuk is 
not.” 

The bird man was friendly. He 
had worked with the Scampos be- 
fore. He liked to help people and 
they liked to be helped. 

“The world and myself can never 
honor the two of you enough,” he 
said, “for saving the Lesser 
Speckled Crackle from extinction. 
Is there now another endangered 
species for which steps should be 
taken?” 

“There is,” Conrad Scampo told 
him. “The Spokelspuk.” 

“We have been informing our- 
selves, of course, as to the habits 
and habitats of the Spokelspuk,” 
Agata said, “and now we have 
come to an expert for advice. Could 
you give us a good rundown on this 
imperiled bird? Are there any 
readily available printouts? Are 
Spokelspuk preservation societies 
already in existence? Sometimes it 
is well to work with existing groups 



ENDANGERED SPECIES

even if they are composed mostly of 
amateurs and lay persons.” 

“Where did you dig up such a 
name as Spokelspuk?” the bird 
man asked. “Did old Lambert dis- 
cover it?” 

“Why, yes. Director Lambert," 
Conrad said, “has declared the 
Spokelspuk an endangered species 
and we are asked to implement its 
preservation.” 

“Did Lambert say that the Spok- 
elspuk was a bird? Or is this an- 
other of those cases where you were 
too proud to confess your ig- 
norance?" 

“Well, what is the Spokelspuk if 
it isn’t a bird?” Conrad asked. 
“What other life form is endan- 
gered?” 

“It isn’t a bird. Not any kind of a 
bird,” the bird man said. “I don’t 
know what it is. I never heard of 
it.” 

The Scampos left him. Out in the 
street Madam Hexe embraced Con- 
rad competently. 

“So he never heard of the Spokel- 
spuk,” Madam Hexe said. “I didn’t 
think he would have. A specialist, 
you know. You had better hire me 
now. We need each other.” 

“You’re so right,” Conrad said, 
enchanted. “She needs the job and 
we need her.” 

44 £ 1 hut up, both of you,” Agata 
»3said. “Where did you ever 
hear of the Spokelspuk, Madam 
Hexe? I don’t remember mention- 
ing the species in your presence.” 



“Are you sure you did not? But 
you’ve thought of it — and I lift 
things out of the mind. There is 
only one way to increase the Spokel- 
spuk population, and that is to 
make more Spokelspuks. And all 
that is required to make them 
consists of sound wits and a good 
heavy wooden mallet.” 

“That is all that is required?” 
Conrad asked. 

“Get lost,” Agata said roughly. 
“No, not you, Conrad. You go with 
me. A bird a Spokelspuk isn’t. 
What’s the next most likely living 
thing?” 

“An insect?” asked Conrad. 

Agata asked, “So what entomol- 
ogist do we know? Oh, oh, and 
what entomologist does Sandy Sue 
work for? Ah, well, he’s the only 
one we know. And there’s a species 
around worse than Sandy Sue. 
Come along then. The buggery is 
right in this block. You, Conrad, 
not you, Hexe.” 

“Oh, you really need me,” said 
Madam Hexe. “A bug it is not.” 

“Oh, we really need her,” said 
Conrad. “A bug it is not.” 

But Agata pulled Conrad into 
the buggery. 

“Oh, it’s that handsome Con- 
rad!” Sandy Sue squealed. “And 
Agata.” 

“Conrad has been bitten by a 
different bug now, Sandy Sue,” 
Agata said. “And I want to talk to 
Mr. Oktopteryx right away.” 

“Go right in, Agata,” Sandy Sue 
said, “and I will try to unbug Con-

rad. We don’t want any strange 
bugs biting him.” 

“Otto,” Agata said to the great 
entomologist, “how does one unbug 
a husband?” 

“You may be using the word in a 
non-entomological sense, Agata,” 
said the great von Oktopteryx. 

“Not entirely, Otto. But you have 
to help me on something else. Can 
you give me some hard information 
on the Spokelspuk? It’s been de- 
clared an endangered species.” 

“I can’t blame you for trying, 
Agata, but it isn’t an insect.” 
“How many kinds of insects are 
there, Otto?” 

“Somewhere between a quarter- 
million and a half million species.” 
“And you know them all?” 

“I know enough about them all 
to know that none of them is named 
the Spokelspuk.” 

“Oh, damn. I wonder what it is 
then.” 

“If it isn’t an insect, then it’s 
something else. Don’t you see how 
that narrows the field? There are 
more species of insect than of all 
other living things added together.” 
“I guess so. Thank you, Otto.” 
Agata went out through the re- 
ception room with its wonderful 
display cases. She found Conrad 
sitting on the silken knees of Sandy 
Sue, apparently getting unbugged. 
Agata led him gently by the ear out 
of the room and out of the building. 

“A bug the Spokelspuk isn’t,” 
she said. 

“Oh, then it has to be an

animal,” he reasoned. “Animal, 
marsupial, amphibian, reptile, 
snake, worm, fish, something. 
Let’s go talk to the great naturalist 
Hugh Singletree.” 

‘‘Let’s go talk to the great 
medium, Madam Hexe," said the 
waiting medium. Madam Hexe. 
She had obtained from somewhere 
a heavy wooden mallet. 

‘‘Let’s go talk to the great 
medium, Madam Hexe,” said the 
befuddled Conrad. 

“Actually, three of the Spokel- 
spuks inhabit a house only short 
blocks from here,” Madam Hexe 
said. “It’s at thirteen-thirteen East 
Hodges. Let’s go there now. Once 
we are there, I believe we can dis- 
cover a way to increase the Spokel- 
spuk population by one, possibly by 
two.” 

“No! We’re going back to Direc- 
tor Lambert to find out what a 
Spokelspuk is,” Agata said. ‘‘I 
must ask — what is the mallet for?” 

“You knock someone off with a 
wooden mallet, you make a Spokel- 
spuk,” the Madam said. “You 
knock someone off with something 
else and you make something else, 
maybe a Spassenspuk or a Spottel- 
spuk. We wouldn’t want that to 
happen. They aren’t endangered 
species.” 

“ — maybe a Spassenspuk or a 
Spottelspuk. We wouldn’t want 
that to happen,” murmured the en- 
chanted Conrad. 

“Untangle yourself from that 
pink-headed witch,” Agata sput- 



tered angrily. “We’re going back to 
Mr. Lambert right now.” 

“Easy, Agata,” Madam Hexe 
jibed. “We want you to get mad, 
yes, but not too mad too soon.” 

“ — to get mad, but not too mad 
too soon,” Conrad echoed. 

They went to see Director Lam- 
bert. 

“Great news, great news,” he 
greeted them. “We have just re- 
ceived important information that 
ties right in with your project. There 
is a nucleus, and it is always easiest 
to add to a nucleus. I have learned 
that three of the rare Spokelspuks 
inhabit a house only short blocks 
from here. It is located at — ” 

“At thirteen-thirteen East 
Hodges,” Agata said dismally. 

“Ah, then you know? Why are 
you here then instead of there?” 
“Oh. Mr. Lambert, we wanted to 
ask you — ” Agata tried to say. 

“Of course it’s all right,” Lam- 
bert assured her. “Get over to thir- 
teen-thirteen at once.” 

They started over to 1313. As 
they walked along, Madam Hexe 
swung her heavy wooden mallet 
and decapitated a cat. 

“What an awful thing to do!” 
Agata cried out. 

“Don’t think of it as killing a cat, 
Agata,” Madam Hexe said. “Think 
of it as making a Katzenspuk.” 
“Think of it as making a 
Katzenspuk,” Conrad echoed her. 

“Why not as making a Spokel- 
spuk, if you use a wooden mallet?” 
Agata asked with sudden suspicion.

“Oh, no. To make a Spokelspuk, 
you must start with a human per- 
son,” Madam Hexe said. 

“ — must start with a human per- 
son,” Conrad echoed. For some 
reason this made Agata feel un- 
naturally cold. 

T he house at 1313 East Hodges 
was large and empty. The win- 
dows were broken out. The doors 
sagged open. Yet it once had been a 
glorious house. Ancient nobility 
clung to it like old moss. It was 
down in its luck, that house, but it 
maintained an attitude of grandeur. 

“Oh, this is the old haunted 
house,” Agata said. “I remember 
it.” 

“In we go,” cried the madam. 
“This may be the new home of one 
or both of you. Over the threshold 
with you, Conrad. In, Agata, in! 
Ah, you can hear old echoes in the 
air right now. Come, come, friends 
in residence, greet us with the 
laugh.” 

The laugh came so powerfully 
that it knocked the three arrivals to 
their knees. The scream (blood- 
thirsty and foully happy), the heart- 
freezing clatter, the gobbling laugh 
that curdled all the body juices — a 
laugh like that should not be 
allowed in hell. That was the sound 
of a male Spokelspuk. The tape had 
not done it justice. 

“The element spuk in the name 
is spook, ghost, isn’t it?” Agata 
asked. She had to say something to 
disguise her shaking. 



“My, you are slow,” the medium 
jibed. “You’ll have to sharpen up 
quick or you’ll be no good at this. 
We’ll want you to get mad, you 
know, when it’s time for it. But you 
can’t be too mad too soon. And it’s 
only a little bit too soon for it now.” 

“You knock off a person with 
that wood mallet, and you make a 
Spokelspuk?” Agata asked in her 
building wrath. 

“Hardly ever,” Madam Hexe 
said sadly. “The world, as we 
know, has been taken over by 
pleasant people, and there’s hardly 
any of any other sort left. The 
pleasant peasants may be good for 
something, but I sure don’t know 
what it is. You can’t make a 
Spokelspuk out of a pleasant per- 
son, I’ll tell you that. It’s because of 
this that there are now so few 
Spokelspuks. They fade away after 
a few hundred years, and they just 
aren’t being replaced. Hardly any 
Spokelspuks are being made. But 
this afternoon we should be able to 
make at least one.” 

“This afternoon we should be 
able to make at least one,” Conrad 
echoed. 

“And, fortunately, you are not a 
pleasant person, Agata,” Madam 
Hexe said. 

“And, fortunately, you are not a 
pleasant person, Agata,” Conrad 
echoed. And the wrath of Agata 
continued to build. 

The other male Spokelspuk 
sounded. His gobbling laugh was 
stronger than that of the first 



ENDANGERED SPECIES

“No human nerves can stand 
much of that horror,” Agata said. 
“Well then, perhaps I will become 
unhuman or post-human. Some- 
thing here swims upstream or goes 
against the grain. 1 love the hateful 
stuff a bit. I suppose it’s mostly 
that I love being hateful.” 

“Get mad, unkempt Agata, get 
mad,” Madam Hexe taunted her. 
“It’s all you’re good for. When you 
go you have to go in a fury or it’s all 
in vain.” 

“Shut up, witch! Sound off, oh 
male sound! Whatever you are, 
you’re stormier than I am. Where is 
the third one?” 

A monstrous noise like that 
could be bagged and sold to horror 
movies by the pound. The twin 
devil-ghost laughters were like rip- 
saws cutting the brain and 
meninges and every nerve. They set 
up a screaming in each inch of the 
body. Such two pillars of strident 
cacophony could not be topped. 

Could they not? The female 
sounded. That cutting, killing, 
spirit-shriveling laughter set the 
very rats to tumbling fearfully out 
of the walls of the haunted house. 
Sound could never be quite the 
same again, after it had included 
this. 

“1 wonder if I could do that?” 
Agata asked almost rationally. Al- 
most, but her eyes weren’t rational 
now. She bled copiously from the 
mouth from her self-bitten tongue 
and lips, and from the ears as they 
all did. And there was white froth 



gathering in the mouth corners. 

“Sure you could do it, Agata,” 
Madam Hexe purred. “And it is al- 
most time that you do it now.” 

“And it is almost time that you 
do it now,” Conrad echoed. 

“What is your real interest in 
this. Madam Hexe?” Agata asked. 
They seemed sane words, but they 
came almost automatically from an 
insane mind. 

“Oh, I’m a paid lobbyist for the 
Spokelspuks,” Madam said. 

“Then why are you so avid for 
our pay also?” Agata questioned. 

“They don’t pay me in material 
coin. I need that also.” 

The horrible triple laughing of 
the Spokelspuks rose to a crest, 
then to a higher crest, then still 
higher. Would it never break? 

“Come here, mad Agata,’’ 
Madam Hexe ordered in her own 
delight. “You are ripe for it now. 
Come here.” The- Madam was 
happy in her coming triumph. She 
was one happy medium. 

Agata came to them. She saw 
Conrad sitting on the numinous 
knees of Madam Hexe on an old 
worm-eaten deacon’s bench. 

“Conrad, you know how such 
silly carry-on always irritates me,” 
Agata said. She spoke gently, but 
she was mad as a gooney-bird. 
Then she screamed and laughed. It 
was the nearest possible thing to 
the Spokelspuk sounding for one 
still wearing the mortal coil. 

She took the bemused Conrad by 
the hair and ears and flung him

across the room where he crashed 
against the wall and came to rest 
beside the wooden mallet. 

Madam Hexe rose smiling. 
Everything was going just as she 
wanted it. Agata struck that happy 
medium full-handedly and set her 
on her numinous rump on the 
floor. 

“She’s ready,” Madam Hexe 
giggled. “Where's the mallet?” 

“She’s ready,” Conrad echoed. 
“Here’s the mallet.” 

Conrad wobbled to his feet with 
the heavy, sound, wooden mallet 
held high in his two hands. He 
bashed his wife heavily and loudly 
on the head with it. 

Killed her too. 

The Spokelspuk population had 
been increased by one. 

Then there were four sources of 
that killer laughter sounding in the 
old haunted house. Oh, oh, oh, oh, 
bleeding ears and blown medullae! 
It was more than flesh could stand. 

I n the courtroom there was a 
fundamental disorder that could 
not be cured. There was, mainly, a 
loud weird noise like demented 
laughter, demented female laugh- 
ter, or the laughter of something 
that had once been female. The 
source of this noise could not be 
located, but the rampant sound 
was nerve-racking and abrasive. 

And then there was the defen- 
dant Conrad Scampo who refused 
to plead insanity. 

“No, no, I am not insane,” he in- 



sisted. “It is just that insane things 
have been happening to me.” 

“You still insist that you killed 
your wife while under the influence 
of a witch known to you only by the 
approximate name (your own term) 
of Madam Haddem?” the prose- 
cutor was questioning him. “And 
now you don’t know where this 
witch is?” 

“She is everywhere. I see her 
everywhere and all the time. I see 
her in the courtroom now, right 
there, right back there, sweet-talk- 
ing one of the guards. See her, the 
witch?” 

“No, Mr. Scampo, I do not see 
the witch. And you are not able to 
describe her further?” 

“Yes. She has numinous knees. 
Examine all the women, and she 
will be the one with numinous 
knees. You can’t miss her. Shut up, 
Agata!! Damn it, shut up!!!" 

“Yes, the noise is irritating, isn’t 
it, Mr. Scampo? We apologize for 
it, but we still have not been able to 
locate the source of it. And you still 
insist that it is the laughter of your 
dead wife?” 

“Yes. Before it happened, she 
said she believed it was a female 
having the last laugh. Well, she 
won’t get away from it. I intend to 
have the last laugh myself. Wait till 
I get my hands on her!” 

“Mr. Scampo, you have stated 
that the approximately-named 
Madam Haddem was a paid lobby- 
ist for a gang of ghosts. Does this 
not strike you as insane?” 



30 



GALAXY 




“It sure does, but I did not state 
it. I stated that the Madam stated 
it.’’ 

“But you did state that Director 
Benoni Lambert of the Species 
Conservation Bureau had declared 
this gang of ghosts to be an endan- 
gered species and had assigned you 
and your wife to finding means of 
increasing the number of these — 
ghosts. But Mr. Lambert com- 
pletely denies this himself. What do 
you say to that?” 

“I think he was taken by a hoax 
that was started somewhere in the 
organization by some too! of the 
Spokelspuks. He was ashamed to 
admit that he didn’t know what 
Spokelspuks were, so he passed it 
along to us. And we were ashamed 
to have to ask what they were.” 

“And now you are worried, not 
so much that you may be executed 
for the murder of your wife, but 
that the manner of execution might 
somehow be wrong?” 

“Yes. If I die in the electric 
chair, I won’t become a Spokelspuk 
at all. I will become something else, 
possibly a Spassenspuk or a Spot- 
telspuk. As such, there is no guar- 
antee that I will meet my wife again 
or even be on the same plane with 
her. Is it too much to ask that I be 
bashed on the head until dead with 
that stout, wooden mallet that is in 
the evidence section there? I’ll put 
an end to that crazy noise quick 
enough then. Just let me get my 
hands on the throat of that loud- 
throated wife of mine and I’ll put 



an end to it.” And Conrad was 
making insane and throttling mo- 
tions with his hands. 

There came the Agata laugh 
again, maddening. 

“No, you will not have the last 
laugh,” Conrad sputtered angrily. 
“I’ll get you, Agata, I’ll get you!” 

“Be calm, Mr. Scampo,” the 
judge said. “And just what is the 
mallet business?” 

“It is a requirement for becom- 
ing a Spokelspuk. After all, you 
have to have some rules for ad- 
mission.” 

“Where, by the way, do these 
ghosts live?’’ the judge asked 
further. 

“In old wooden houses mostly,” 
Conrad told him. “They can’t live 
in a sod house at all. They can in- 
habit a brick or stone house if there 
is enough wood in the interior, but 
they are not comfortable there. 
They can inhabit, for a while, a 
courtroom in a terra cota and glass 
courthouse, if there is wooden 
paneling and wooden benches and 
tables, but they sure are not com- 
fortable in such. I’m not either. I’m 
leaving. This whole thing is a farce 
anyhow.” 

“You are not leaving, Mr. 
Scampo. You are not going any- 
where,” the judge said. “Do you 
realize that you are on trial for your 
life?” 

“I’ve told you already that I 
didn’t want my life,” Conrad said 
with a new chill in his voice. “I 
forfeit it. The only question now is

whether the condemned man 
should be allowed to choose his own 
method of execution. I choose the 
mallet and you all look at me like a 
bunch of bare-faced idiots. And 
you say that I'm insane/’ 

Conrad left the chair, and he 
seemed about to leave the court- 
room with resolute step. There was 
the taunting, terrifying Agata laugh 
again. 

And there was a sudden motion 
by a pink-haired lady who had been 
standing by the evidence box and 
sweet-talking one of the guards. 
She grabbed the stout, wooden 
mallet out of that evidence box, 
and she bashed Conrad Scampo 
heavily and loudly over the head 
with it. 

Killed him too. 

“That was really a lot of fun,” 
said Madam Hexe, or Madam 
Haddem as Conrad had approxi- 
mately called her. Several things 
happened then. 

The screaming, gobbling, sicken- 
ing laugh of Agata was throttled 
down to sickening silence. Conrad 
had finally got his hands on that 
loud-throated wife of his and was 
choking her, not to death for she 
was already dead, but into a queasy 
quiet. 

Then the unpracticed but power- 
ful death-moment laugh of Conrad 
Scampo sounded deafeningly. He 
had made it! He was a Spokelspuk 
now and he had, for the moment, 
the last laugh. 

“You had better put that body in 



the disposal,” Madam Hexe said 
briskly to the judge, “and then 
have someone mop up the brains 
which were so clumsily spilled.” 

“ — had better put that body in 
the disposal,” murmured the nine 
parts bemused judge, “and then 
have someone mop up the spilled 
brains. But wait a minute, lady. 
You have killed a man in my court- 
room. Shouldn’t I do something?” 

“Yes,” said the Madam. “You 
are a judge. Give the judgment that 
the Spokelspuk is no longer to be 
considered an endangered species. 
The two new ones should keep 
them going for another hundred 
years.” 

“ — make a judgment,” the now 
totally bemused judge was mum- 
bling, “that the Spokelspuk be no 
longer considered an endangered 
species.” 

“I really have to go. now,” said 
the Madam. “Here’s my card. (It 
was a simple queen of spades.) 
“Put it on the bulletin board. I give 
psychosomatic readings every 
morning from ten to twelve. Per- 
haps I can be of help to some of 
you.” 

“ — every morning from ten to 
twelve. Perhaps she can be of help to 
some of us.” 

Madam Hexe left the courtroom 
and went about her affairs. 

She had some odd groups for 
clients. 

And she had a lot of class. She 
looked like a younger member of an 
older endangered species. *

W hen the Encephaloprinter 
was invented in the middle of 
the twenty-first century no one in 
uncart could think what to do 
with it. It had no economic value or 
any practical application that could 
be seen. Dr. Julian Cox, its 
inventor, worked in a Cambridge 
laboratory run by a British sub- 
sidiary of EUROCART. Thus Cox’s 
invention became the property of 
eurocart and so of uncart. Al- 
most none of the world’s research 
was independent of uncart, or 
more specifically of its science arm, 
uncart/sci, through its worldwide 
member organizations. Every day, 
throughout the world, hundreds of 
ideas, devices and products flowed 
from these labs for assessment, pro- 
duction and sales. However, un- 
cart leaders were not so short- 
sighted as to ignore the value of 
pure research and thousands of 
people like Cox were allowed to 
putter in any fashion they wished, 
provided that when the lead turned 
to gold in the alembic the process 
became the exclusive property of 
UNCART. 

Cox was a researcher into psychic 
phenomena and it was from this 
study that he invented, discover- 
ed — or simply stumbled across — 
the Encephaloprinter. First ac- 
counts of it made it sound like a 
super brainwave machine, but this 
was nonsense. Cox had long since 
lost interest in brainwaves — Alpha, 
Theta, or what have you. What he 
was after was much more subtle. 



Telepathy, he postulated, did not 
consist of sending waves back and 
forth. The moving of solid objects 
was not the effect of emitted brain- 
power. Second sight did not come 
from any force latent and/or in- 
herent in the brain itself. This had 
all been pretty well demonstrated 
for decades. There were no super 
brainwaves and there could be no 
machine to measure them. 

Yet these phenomena existed. 
Over the past fifty years research 
had made great strides and prov- 
able results had been attained. It 
had been demonstrated beyond 
doubt that the human mind could 
do many things that could not be 
explained by emanations or waves. 
Like many before him, Cox had run 
through the Greek alphabet of 
brainwaves, Kirlian photographs, 
the results of the newer Van Donck 
deep-brain analyzer, plus some in- 
ventions of his own. But there he 
stalled. The Greek alphabet had no 
connection with what he was 
looking for. Neither did electro- 
magnetic field auras. These were 
only tangential to the brain’s own 
interna! functions. So he stopped de- 
signing new, more sensitive receivers 
and when he did this, enlightenment 
came. It was then that he began to 
distinguish the Koran’s white thread 
from the black in the dawn. 

If the brain regarded as a trans- 
mitter had proved to be the wrong 
concept, Cox thought, perhaps it 
should be looked upon as a receiver 
or, more accurately, as an aware

mass that senses and reacts. This 
concept was Cox’s achievement. It 
received almost no publicity or even 
notice at the time he first advanced 
it. News of it was released to the 
public in simplest terms because 
there was no other way to make it 
even halfway understandable. So 
the public yawned over its coffee as 
the, news of the Encephaloprinter 
clattered out of its video, a short 
paragraph after the fashions and 
before the sports page. 

I t was presented equally simply 
to the Directors of uncart at a 
regular biweekly meeting. The 
eight, as usual, had lunched to- 
gether in the executive dining 
room. They had then strolled 
peacefully across the formal Per- 
sian garden to the administrative 
wing. If they had happened to look 
they might have seen the hump- 
backed magnificence of Dema- 
vand, snow-capped even this late in 
the spring, shining on the horizon. 
They had eaten a good lunch and 
were contented men. 

And powerful men. 

At each of the eight places at the 
round conference table lay a sheet 
of paper giving a concise explana- 
tion of the Encephaloprinter and as 
much of the theory as was under- 
stood. Everything at the Director’s 
level of uncart was presented on a 
single sheet. An idea that could not 
be so reduced had clearly not been 
thought through. However, if there 
were problems — and usually there 



were — Dr. Gertrude Gold, c/un- 
cart/sci, was there to remove 
them. 

The conference room itself was a 
striking example of the architecture 
that made up the whole uncart 
complex. It was hexagonal to begin 
with, the better to accomodate the 
round conference table. The round 
table was necessary because un- 
cart had no real head, but a direc- 
torate, all equal. The chairmanship 
rotated among the eight. The room 
was meant to reflect equality and 
there was nothing about the table, 
chairs or place settings that would 
set one Director above another. 

The six walls, as well as the ceil- 
ing, were reinforced plexi-quartz, 
bullet-proof and nearly atom-proof. 
The polarity of the walls and ceiling 
could be regulated to provide any 
degree of darkness or light. Today 
the two walls nearest the westering 
sun were dark and the ceiling slight- 
ly so, giving the whole room a pleas- 
ant glow. Through the ceiling the 
white clouds in the strikingly blue 
Persian sky stood out starkly. The 
view through the walls was of sur- 
rounding gardens leading up to the 
mountain on one side and down to 
the swift river on the other. Imbed- 
ded in the plexi-quartz were wires 
that kept any sort of emanation from 
penetrating. The room was proof 
against afiy known listening device, 
thanks to uncart/sec. Next to the 
door stood the booth of the engineer 
who controlled the lighting, worked 
the entrance, adjusted the tempera-

ture and humidity, hooked up the 
simultaneous interpreters when 
necessary, ran the holograph pro- 
jector and all the other mechanical, 
hydraulic and electronic gear in the 
room. His booth, entirely sound- 
proof so he could not hear the Direc- 
tors talk, could only be entered from 
outside. But even with these precau- 
tions he still held a sec Cosmoclear, 
the highest security clearance. 

The Directors took up their 
papers and read, some idly, some 
intently. Within a minute most were 
fidgeting. Viktor Demchenko of 
sovcakt put down his paper and 
tapped it. The others looked up as if 
this had released them from labor. 

“Perhaps you could summarize 
this for us, good Dr. Gold,” he 
suggested. 

Gertrude Gold turned slowly 
toward him. She was a large 
woman and oddly shaped. She 
studied Demchenko through large, 
thick glasses, like portholes and 
said seriously, “It has been sum- 
marized to the utmost in the report 
you hold. If you would be so good 
as to read it, I will try to answer any 
questions later.” 

Demchenko’s gentlemanly smile 
faded and he looked down at his 
paper like a fourth-grader. 

“Of course,” he said, “Quite 
so.” 

Dr. Gold was right. There was 
nothing wrong with the summary. 
It told the men what they needed to 
know out of what was already 
known, but the concept was not 



really clear to anyone. It could be 
described in terms of effect but no 
more. They were all in Plato’s cave, 
seeing shadows of reality. 



T he paper said that the aura, 
the halo, the excitation, that 
surrounds everyone and everything 
somehow in turn excites the brain. 
These halos of excitation vary 
greatly in strength, but extend in- 
finitely, interlocking like smoke 
rings or, better, smoke balls. Each 
brain is aware of these bubbles and 
tunes in or vibrates in frequency 
with some of them in its character- 
istic way. It is how — and to 
which — of these vibrations a mind 
tunes in that controls its mood. 
Since no two people tune to excite- 
ments in quite the same way, 
people behave differently in the 
face of the same stimuli. 

This set or cast of the bfain has 
little to do with intelligence, but it 
does affect personality and re- 
sponse. The brain oscillator deter- 
mines what stimuli are selected and 
thus predestines the conscious level 
of the mind that deals with 
them — a sort of super-ego manage- 
ment package. 

Cox’s invention can record which 
excitations a brain responds or is 
tuned to. The Printer does not tell 
what these stimuli convey to the 
brain but only that they do it. No 
specific area is involved in this ac- 
tivity, which apparently depends 
upon an undifferentiated quality of 



36 



GALAXY 




the brain — now named Cox’s 
Quality. 

The paper said in conclusion that 
some experiments had been done 
but with indeterminate results. 

The Directors finished reading 
and sat looking at each other. 
eurocart’s Reinholt Blessing, this 
year’s Chairman, cleared his throat. 

“1 am sure there must be ques- 
tions, gentlemen,” he said. 

A group chuckle answered him. 
These were bright men, but they 
were not scientists. Their abilities 
were as managers, financiers and 
manipulators. Some were not even 
well educated. However, they had 
all made their way, or worked their 
way, or fought their way, up the 
uncart stairway. Sitting where 
they were made them ipso facto 
successful. They needed no apology 
for depending on others to furnish 
expertise. Dr. Gold was one of their 
experts. 

“Am I to understand,” Robert 
Ndolo of afcart said, “that things 
are making our brains vibrate?” 

“I prefer to say resonate,” Dr. 
Gold said. “Like tuning forks.” 

“No, no, that doesn’t help me,” 
Togo of nipcart said. 

“I’m sorry, gentlemen,” Gold 
said, “but I can’t do any better. We 
in sci don’t completely understand 
Cox’s Quality. We simply know 
how it works — not why.” 

“To interrupt,” Blessing said, 
“we have a full plate of business in 
front of us today and it seems to me 
our task is to decide quickly what 



uncart is to do, if anything, with 
this — ah — thing, or device.” 

“Now we’re getting somewhere,” 
Holdeman of uscart said. 

“Certainly. You men are the Di- 
rectors.” Dr. Gold regarded them 
coldly from behind her portholes. 
“I will leave now if you are through 
with me.” She started to turn to- 
ward the door. The directors par- 
tially rose as one man. They wanted 
no repetition of the lib strike of ten 
years before when every woman in 
all of uncart and its subsidiaries 
walked off the job for three weeks. 
Dr. Gold had been their leader. 
Demchenko threw himself into the 
breach. 

“Please, please, my dear Dr. 
Gold,” he said, his arms out- 
stretched. “Nothing, nothing like 
that. Why, we need you now more 
than ever.” 

With a slight shrug of mollifica- 
tion she turned back. “Well, of 
course, 1 am at your service.” 

As she waited and looked at 
them the silence became more em- 
barrassing — as if they had rubbed a 
lamp, the genie had appeared and 
they were fresh out of wishes. 
Speak, junior, Grandma’s on the 
line. 

“Well, all right, resonate, then,” 
Ndolo said, going way back and so 
buying time. 

“And this device, this, ah — ” the 
chairman looked at his sheet, “this 
Encephaloprinter, measures the 
vibrations or whatever that stimu- 
late the brain to resonate?” 



COX’S QUALITY 



37 




Dr. Gold slumped and seemed to 
drive herself even more deeply into 
the carpet. 

“No, no, Mr. Blessing,” she 
said. “It measures the brain’s re- 
sponse to them only. As far as we 
can determine, the vibrations — as 
you call them — cannot be mea- 
sured.” 

“But, my God, my God,” Dem- 
chenko said. “What then have 
we?” 

Facing up to it and dredging up 
the last bit of analogy she had 
brought with her. Dr. Gold said, “I 
told you we don’t know everything. 
Think of this instrument as a spec- 
troscope. Aim it at a brain and it 
will show you a pattern of exci- 
tation. This is simply a measure of 
Cox’s Quality. I might add that no 
two prints are the same.” 

“Like fingerprints,” Castenero 
of amcart put in happily. The 
others smiled. Dr. Gold looked at 
him without remark. 

They all relaxed. This was the ul- 
timate. Beyond this they had no re- 
sponsibility to try to understand. 

Chen Tsing Peng, of sincart, 
had been quiet throughout. Now he 
indicated to Blessing that he would 
like to be heard. Blessing nodded to 
him. 

“If I may say, gentlemen,” Peng 
said in his highly modulated voice, 
“we still elude the mark. What are 
we to do about this?” 

“Right, right,” Castenero said, 
“we’re being stupid.” 

“No, no,” Peng said seriously. 



“Not that. We have simply been led 
astray by the unfathomable — per- 
haps falsely intrigued.” He turned 
to Dr. Gold. “May I ask what I 
hope are a few pertinent ques- 
tions?” 

“Yes, let’s go at it,” Ndolo said, 
looking hard at his watch. Gold ig- 
nored the gesture and nodded to 
Peng. 

are informed,” Peng 
Vt said, “that this resonance 
probably accounts for psychic ac- 
tivity of one sort or another. Is this 
correct?” 

Again Dr. Gold simply nodded. 

“Now then, if the Encephalo- 
printer can — what should 1 say — ? 
Register?” 

“As good a word as any,” Dr. 
Gold said. 

“ — register these resonances, can 
the device be adapted to produce 
desired psychic effects of some 
kind? Is there a possibility of useful 
benefits?” 

Dr. Gold hesitated. She looked 
uneasily in several directions, as 
though she were missing some- 
thing. When explaining anything 
she was used to having an imple- 
ment of some sort in her hand — a 
light board stylus, a holograph 
pointer, or some such tool for em- 
phasis — and she felt uncomfortable 
without it. She reached in front of 
Mr. Togo and took his notaboard 
stylus. She began to jab the air with 
it as if she were impaling insects. 

“Excuse me, Mr. Togo,” she 



38 



GALAXY 




said. “We have, of course, carried 
on innumerable experiments em- 
ploying the device, using both sen- 
sitive people, telepaths and the 
like, and normal — rather, nonsen- 
sitive — people. What we have 
achieved is the ability to trace the 
sensitive psyche at work. By use of 
the Printer we can see two sensitive 
brains resonate in tune with each 
other. This does not happen to non- 
sensitives. Between a sensitive and 
a nonsensitive we can see the first 
respond but not the second. This 
suggests that Cox’s Quality, what- 
ever it is, is at work in telepathy 
and other psychic phenomena.” 
She was interrupted by Ali 
Abbassi, Director of ascart. “You 
said other psychic phenomena? Do 
you mean ghosts, table rappings, 
levitation — things like that?” 

“Oh, my God,” Holdeman mut- 
tered. “He’s back with the genies.” 
Some of the others looked at their 
hands. Castenero whipped out a 
handkerchief and flicked at his boot. 

“As a matter of fact,” Dr. Gold 
said, “we have used the instrument 
in studies of psychokinesis — ” She 
paused, made up her mind and ap- 
pended: “That is, moving solid ob- 
jects by the power of the mind.” 
Interest renewed around the 
table. All looked expectant. 

“We can see how this works, 
too,” she went on. “We can see the 
sensitive tune to the emanations, 
aura, whatever you want to call it, 
of an object and then alter itself to 
force the object to resonate in turn

as if from a different place. In fact, 
the object is then in that different 
place.” 

She looked around, rocking her 
stylus back and forth like a metro- 
nome. There were no questions. 

“As to your first example, Mr. 
Abbassi,” she said and smiled, 
cueing them that she was going to 
say something amusing. “Because 
Cox’s Quality expends no energy, 
seems limitless and universal — in 
short, simply exists — some of our 
more religious citizens have taken it 
as proof of immortality, suggesting 
that Cox’s Quality is in fact the 
soul, if you please.” 

She faced them one by one, the 
smile still on her face. The Di- 
rectors reacted with puzzlement. 
Some resonated back her smile 
weakly. 

“Ridiculous,” Demchenko snort- 
ed. 

“Quite,” Gold said. Her smile 
faded and disappeared as if her 
cheek muscles had suddenly grown 
tired. 

“We have no place for such re- 
marks here,” Togo said. “What a 
man chooses to think of the soul is 
a personal matter.” 

“Please.” Blessing tapped the 
table with his stylus. Again silence 
fell. 

Peng had been jotting on the 
illuminated notaboard in front of 
him. Now he looked at Blessing and 
raised his eyebrows. The skin grew 
taut on his cheekbones and brow, 
making them even more prominent. 



His head resembled, for the mo- 
ment, an anatomical model — or the 
unwrapped skull of a mummy. 

“Mr. Peng," Blessing said with 
relief. “1 believe you have some 
words for us.” 

“Yes, I do. It seems that our 
options are quite simple, so simple, 
in fact, that I wonder why this 
matter was brought to us at all.” 

Dr. Gold stiffened slightly. Peng 
noticed her reaction. 

“I realize this is not the fault of 
sci,” he said hastily. “It is not their 
function to make such decisions. 
But it puzzles me that ind/prodev 
couldn’t have decided whether or 
not this had applicability — and 
acted accordingly.” 

“If you will pardon me,” Togo 
said, “I believe they did decide. 
That is not the question.” 

“Oh?” Peng said. “There is no 
such statement here.” 

“Well, nonetheless, I believe it is 
the case. My staff so informed me,” 
Togo said somewhat apprehen- 
sively. 

‘‘Is this true?” Peng asked 
Blessing. 

“I believe there was some such 
preliminary paper that some of us 
may have seen,” Blessing said, 
waffling as best he could, while 
looking down at the designs on his 
notaboard. 

“I haven’t seen it either,” Ndolo 
cut in. “What goes on here, sec- 
rets?” 

“No, no,” Holdeman said. “Just 
another screw-up in admin/repro.

The report is probably on your desk 
right now.” 

“How have we survived so long?” 
Abbassi asked simply. He gave a 
small shrug. “But ce sera, sera, 
huh? No one is perfect.” 

O dd jottings and dpodlings were 
being put on the assorted nota- 
boards. Peng sighed and began 
again. 

“Well, that is neither here nor 
there and cuts no ice,” he said. He 
had an excellent working command 
of English and of its idioms, which 
he took pride in using as often as he 
could. But in his mouth the idioms 
became transformed somehow, 
took on strange colorations, as if he 
had just made them up. “The 
device has no practical application, 
is that correct, Dr. Gold?” 

“So I’m told,” she said idly, as if 
this were irrelevant to her, as in- 
deed it was. 

“Then what is the question be- 
fore us?” Peng asked. 

“Simply this,” Holdeman said, 
“set has asked for authority to 
broadcast news of Cox’s Quality 
throughout its organization. Any- 
one interested would then be 
allowed to spend his time and un- 
cart’s money working on it to see if 
it can be further developed.” He 
hesitated meaningfully, then went 
on: “It’s the money thing, you see.” 
“Ah,” Peng said. 

“Let anyone work on it, huh?” 
Castenero was clipping his nails. 
“As against keeping it more or less 



close, yes, that’s right,” Holdeman 
said. 

Demchenko emitted a wordless 
sound of displeasure and Dr. Gold 
cut in impatiently with a two-minute 
lecture on science and freedom ofin- 
vestigation and how useful results 
were only obtained by open inquiry. 
To keep the Printer a semi-secret 
would doom it to remain no more 
than an interesting device. She cited 
numerous examples to prove her 
point. She closed with an exhorta- 
tion, a note of irritation in her voice 
with these laymen who had so much 
power and seemed to her so patently 
mediocre. 

“So, gentlemen,” she said, “if 
you want Cox’s Quality to remain 
uninvestigated and — from your 
point, unexploited — to become only 
a laboratory toy for a few selected 
graduate students, then by all 
means keep it limited. You would 
save money in the short run. But if 
you ever hope to have a use for it, ac- 
tually make money from it — ” they 
cringed as this Boadicea used their 
key word — “then free it to all.” 

They agreed quickly. They recog- 
nized the sense she made and, in 
any case, no one had the temerity to 
argue. Only Togo managed to in- 
troduce a small squeak of practi- 
cality. 

“But how much money?” 

“It is nothing, nothing,” Abbassi 
said, waving his hand. “How much 
could it be?” He clearly spoke for 
the others who wanted to be done 
with the question. 



COX’S QUALITY

And so these men had made an- 
other hard-headed, closely reason- 
ed decision. The Encephaloprinter 
would be given to sci for free inves- 
tigation by anyone who cared. 

Dr. Gold smiled her cheek- 
wrenching smile, stood, and left the 
room. 

After another hour of business 
the meeting broke up and the Di- 
rectors moved to the pneumatic 
quartz door. They felt happy with 
themselves, uncart’s affairs were 
in good shape. They could now ad- 
journ to the bar, enjoy a drink and 
go home. 

There was much “please” and 
“after you” at the door until only 
Abbassi and Blessing were left, 
bowing and waving at each other. 
Blessing, as Chairman, was deter- 
mined to be last and Abbassi, from 
simple Persian training, could not 
bring himself to go before. Finally, 
when the others were halfway down 
the corridor to the bar, both moved 
at the same time and jammed to- 
gether through the door, apolo- 
gizing as they went. 

The Directors strolled in small 
groups, except for Peng who walk- 
ed alone marching to his own beat. 
They were well dressed as befitted 
their station. They wore conven- 
tional business attire, soft colorful 
shirts with long rolled collars, some 
with ruffles down the front, cum- 
merbunds with utili-pleats for nota- 
boards, stylus, UNcred cards and 
the like. Peng was the most simply 
dressed — Castenero was the most 



elegant. The luxury cloth of his 
shirt was a product of one of un- 
cart/ sci/eco/ag’s successful ex- 
periments in crop reintroduction in 
Mexico. The project had been hid- 
eously expensive and was far from 
being economic as yet. Castenero’s 
shirt was one hundred percent pure 
cotton. 

He hurried, caught up with 
Holdeman and took his arm. 

“Ah, amigo,” he said, “this Dr. 
Gold is some Amazon, is she not?” 

“But one of the world’s top psy- 
chologists,” Holdeman said. 

“Sure, obviously.” Castenero 
laughed and slapped Holdeman’s 
shoulder lightly. “But still a 
woman, huh? Still a woman?” 

“Dr. Gold?” Holdeman seemed 
startled. Then he chuckled. "Yes, I 
suppose. Ferd, you Latins find ro- 
mance anywhere, even if you have 
to make it up.” 

“It is our myopia,” Castenero 
said with a slight tilt of the head, as 
if stating a fact, perhaps unfortu- 
nate, but one about which nothing 
could be done. “We keep hold of 
the past.” 

“There are worse things.” 

“But gone, amigo, all gone. Ah, 
if gunpowder had not been invented 
we Latins would still rule the world. 
Now we all come from the big 
uncart can.” 

T he origins of the uncart “can” 
were not clear, nor could any- 
one even say for sure what uncart 
meant. Some thought the letters 



42 



GALAXY 




stood for United Nations Cartel, an 
outgrowth of the UN still in New 
York. Others thought Universal 
Cartel, still others, Ultra-National 
Cartel. No one knew. Even the first 
documents of its forming referred 
to the body only as uncart. There 
was a story that it had been started 
in Cologne in the middle of the 
eighteenth century by a German 
Jew named Unkart, but this was 
plainly absurd. There were those 
who had suffered from uncart’s 
operations — and they were many — 
who called it Unscrupulous. 

Actually, uncart had won its 
position so gradually that some 
thought it had always been, like 
God, like the Universe, uncart/ 
cult/hist could trace its origins 
back effectively to the Renaissance, 
with only a gap here and there ac- 
counted for by human error. 
uncart had managed people’s 
lives so long that no one now could 
conceive of a world without it. 
There was an awful pun that said 
uncart had come before the horse. 

uncart had united the world, 
not politically, but through more 
effective means. As all but ideo- 
logues should have known would 
happen, man’s world had been 
united by economics, not politics. 
All men now were capitalists, big or 
small, or hoped to be capitalists. 
The linkages of big business all 
over the world had become strong. 
A world business organization of 
immense power had come into be- 
ing. Not only had it grown — it had 



come to be accepted because people 
realized that running the world was 
too important to be left to the poli- 
ticians. There was simply too much 
at stake. 

The somewhat loose organization 
had formalized itself as uncart 
with headquarters in Tehran shortly 
after the turn of the century. Tehran 
had been chosen for several reasons. 
It was convenient, located centrally 
between East and West. It had be- 
come a comfortable and modern 
cosmopolitan city where life could 
be pleasant. It was also removed 
from the influence of the great 
power blocks — while uncart ruled 
and wished to rule, it did not want to 
be seen to rule more than necessary. 

uncart had built a magnificent 
headquarters complex in a valley 
north of Tehran that led to the old 
Shimshak ski resort. The valley was 
narrow and deep, with a clear, 
mountain-fed stream coursing its 
length. Built into the sides of the 
valley were the office buildings, lab- 
oratories, communications facili- 
ties, living quarters, bars, clubs, 
pools, and everything else that thou- 
sands of multi-national employees 
needed to live and work. The archi- 
tecture, while modern, reflected the 
setting and had a definite Persian 
cast that was thoroughly satisfying. 

Much plexi-quartz had been 
used in the structure. To set off the 
resultant starkness the roofs had 
wide overhangs, supported by flat 
columns interspersed with rows of 
bas-relief and mosaics. Gardens

and pools afforded serene walks be- 
tween buildings. The interiors fea- 
tured planted arcades and malls. 
sc^sy/amb had scientifically speci- 
fied the ambience for maximum 
employee efficiency and peace of 
mind. The entire facility had a 
quiet campus atmosphere which 
did not reflect the immense power 
concealed in its walls. 

As years went by uncart grew to 
rule governments. It continued to 
tolerate the UN but ruled there 
also. Because war was unprofitable 
and upsetting to the established 
economic order uncart would not 
tolerate it. It ended the Arab-Israeli 
problem that had been at flash 
point for over half a century 
through a superbly simple device — 
uncart subsidiaries took over the 
management of the combatant 
countries. The black-white con- 
frontation in southern Africa had 
been similarly resolved. Now black 
and white worked for managers 
manipulated out of Tehran. 

uncart was made up of eight 
regional cartel groupings: uscart, 

SOVCART, NIPCART, SINCART, EU- 
ROCART, AFCART, AMCART and 

ascart. Experience had shown 
that eight was a good number, not 
too large and yet not overly centra- 
lized. 

Political boundaries remained, 
although now largely as a matter of 
sentiment. Economic documents 
were more important than the old 
political passports. The plastic, 
Inter-Com card or Inter-Cred card 



had replaced them. The three dia- 
monds of Mitsubushi stamped on a 
card were more useful than the ris- 
ing sun. The block GM in plastic 
moved through customs easier than 
did the screaming eagle. The 
chemex imprint worked more won- 
ders than the hammer and sickle. 

B asic English was the world’s 
lingua franca. It had become 
such automatically and as a matter 
of course in spite of the efforts of 
the Esperantists and the French. 
The French still maintained sub- 
sidized Ecoles-Francaises around 
the world out of nostalgia for the 
grand langue and gallic stubborn- 
ness, but these were filled with dil- 
letantes and antiquaries. The Ger- 
mans had long since written off the 
Goethe Instituten. The Russians 
still maintained VOKS in various 
countries because the ancient, sen- 
timental old men of the Politburo 
could not bring themselves to close 
them. But they perked along only 
half-heartedly, full of people wish- 
ing only to read Tolstoy in the ori- 
ginal. uNCARTtuLT tolerated these 
aberrations because there was no 
reason not to. 

World population had stabilized 
by the turn of the century at about 
six billion. No one knew why. It 
simply happened, as if the result of 
some silent international agreement 
or universal urge. The witty said 
that this confirmed the old adage 
that the Lord looked after children, 
drunks and fools, uncart had put

GALAXY 




(he world on the metric system and 
traffic everywhere on the right side 
of the road. 

Directors of the eight regional 
carts made up uncart’s Board. 
The Chairman’s position was 
neither elected nor permanent. 
Each cart’s Director took his turn 
as Chairman for one year, after 
which he retired. Retirement for 
the Chairman was not mandatory 
but was invariably observed. Who 
could possibly work again on the 
slopes after having been on the 
summit? The Supreme Commander 
cannot become just another Gene- 
ral or Admiral. 

Blessing had been Chairman for 
about half his term when the prob- 
lem of the Encephaloprinter, or 
ECP, as sci called it, had arisen. 
He had only two weeks to go when 
the Directors were again assembled 
to consider a far larger problem 
and to make a far greater decision. 
They were being urged, in effect, to 
change the personality of man. 

II 

T he development came about 
with stunning swiftness, direct 
result of the earlier decision to let 
sci publicize the ECP. To an extent 
that surprised even herself, Dr. 
Gold had been startlingly correct. 
She had had no doubt that once 
sci’s community, her community, 
was turned loose on the ECP 
further development would come. 
What was not expected was the 



speed of this next development and 
the implications that were freighted 
with it, almost its own natural 
imperative. 

An obscure technician in Milan 
named Guido Mangiani, exposed 
to news about the Encephaloprinter 
(ECP), invented the Encephaloim- 
printer, now called the ECIP. 
Mangiani was not even a scientist 
in the technical sense. He was one 
of the army of faceless, anonymous 
lab employees that set up equip- 
ment, monitored experiments, 
cleaned tubes, took readings and 
did other routine jobs for the scien- 
tists. He was, in short, a soldier, a 
sergeant at best, in uncart’s 
science army, doing the jobs that 
the field grade officers couldn’t be 
bothered with. 

His humble status was an embar- 
rassment to sci and Dr. Gold 
scarcely mentioned him when brief- 
ing the Directors. Indeed, after his 
one moment of glory his invention 
was taken from him and he was 
never again noted in the history of 
uncart/ sci. He became a scientific 
non- or un-person. Presumably, he 
returned to the obscurity of the scien- 
tific KP from whence he had come. 
But, his invention, the ECIP, lived 
and had to be lived with, decided 
about, done something with. To that 
extent, Mangiani had been as 
anonymously immortalized as the 
Lascaux cave painters. 

The usual one-page briefing 
paper lay before the Directors and 
again they read it with varying 



COX’S QUALITY 



45 




degrees of care and understanding. 
Dr. Gold had again screwed herself 
into the rug while she waited im- 
patiently for the gentlemen to look 
up. She tapped a stylus against her 
thigh like a choir director as the 
eight tried to absorb the fact of 
Mangiani’s invention, the ECIP. 

Perhaps because he was more of 
a technician than a scientist, he 
had approached the ECP as an 
electronic device to be used and 
fooled with, experimented with, 
changed, like a teenager working 
on a car. His method had been em- 
pirical. While the scientists mused 
over theory and did not advance, 
Mangiani changed the ECP, added 
a playback and one day, without 
knowing how or why, he had invent- 
ed the Imprinter. In experiments on 
animals, using his adapted ECP 
with a playback, he found that he 
could imprint certain personality 
traits on one monkey onto the brain 
of another. By taking the ECP tape 
of a docile, retiring rhesus and run- 
ning it through the playback into 
the skull of a maladjusted rhesus he 
could alter its personality until the 
second rhesus was as gentle as the 
first. For some reason the playback 
forced the subject brain to respond 
to external auras just as did the 
brain of the pattern. 

At this point the high-priced help 
discovered Mangiani and elbowed 
him aside. Further experiments 
were done without him and his 
device was given the official name, 
“The Milan Encephaloimprinter.” 



It was called that in the Directors’ 
briefing paper. In a burst of 
euphoria, at first sci believed it had 
a device of unlimited utility, a ma- 
chine that could raise the level of all 
human intellect, that could pick 
and choose among man’s most de- 
sirable attributes and assemble 
them into a master tape that would 
alter every brain and personality un- 
til humanity reached a single miracle 
working level barely below the gods. 

But the gods were not yet ready 
to unlock that apartment just 
downstairs. The ECIP could and 
would transfer the ECP tape char- 
acteristics from one to another, but 
that was all, no more and no less. 
There could be no retail bargaining 
among its components because no 
one knew what parts of the tape 
came from which stimuli or what 
they affected. You took it all or not, 
as you chose. 

“Well, practically, then, Dr. 
Gold,” Togo asked, “what have 
you achieved with this device?” He 
repeated himself. “Practically, that 
is.” 

“Certain interesting things have 
been done with it in husys,” she 
said, and — ” 

“I beg your pardon,” Togo said 
questioningly. 

Dr. Gold paused, mouth open, 
stylus poised for another job. It 
took her several seconds to figure 
out just what the question was. 

“Oh,” she said at last, “sorry. 
Human Systems. Part of scif>SY.” 
She stood motionless. 



46 



GALAXY 




“Thank you,” Togo said. The 
others nodded, some uneasily, 
wondering how many other sets of 
initials were equally unknown to 
them. Vast sections of this uncart 
world of theirs must inevitably 
operate day to day entirely out of 
their ken or control. Better than 
most, the Directors appreciated 
their own humanity. 

“You were saying. Doctor?” 
Blessing said, exercising the pre- 
rogative which time was inexorably 
taking from him. Oh, well, his 
company villa on the Eiger would, 
perhaps, not be all that bad. 

“ — and what they have done,” 
she went on, beginning to move 
again, as if she had been frozen and 
was now suddenly thawed, “is to 
experiment with personality char- 
acteristics in certain people, com- 
mon laborers mostly.” 

The Directors looked at her with 
renewed interest because this seem- 
ed to be an area of obvious economic 
application. 

“For example,” she said, “the 
sci/husys unit at FIAT/Chrysler/ 
BMW in Turin imposed the Quality 
Reaction of good workers onto 
those of poor workers and the 
results were very rewarding.” 

said Quality Reac- 
I tion?” Holdeman cut in. 
She nodded. “Yes, it’s a term we 
have started using to describe the 
response of Cox’s Quality to the 
aura stimulus of people and 
things.” 



“1 see,” Holdeman went on. “In 
other words, this ECIP can alter a 
person’s brains to respond like 
some other person’s.” 

“No,” Dr. Gold said. “Not 
quite. It can alter only Cox's 
Quality, whatever that is, not the 
entire brain. The ECIP process has 
nothing to do with intelligence or 
anything else except the brain’s ac- 
ceptance of outside aura stimula- 
tions, vibrations, or what have 
you.” 

Quiet settled on the room again. 
The sun had moved farther down 
one of the plexi-quartz walls and 
was shining brightly across the 
table in a pale yellow line. Blessing 
looked at the engineer in his sound- 
proof booth, ran a finger along the 
yellow line and made a turning mo- 
tion with his hand. The engineer 
nodded and immediately the sun 
wall darkened and the opposite 
wall lightened. Blessing sighed in 
satisfaction. Ah, he thought, sic 
transit, and all that. 

Robert Ndolo pushed his chair 
back slightly and stared at the doc- 
tor, eyes large and dark in the long 
brown face with its strong straight 
nose. At times Ndolo could re- 
semble a guardian image, a chal- 
lenge immobilized in flesh. Dr. 
Gold acknowledged his stare with a 
nod. 

“Mr. Ndolo?” 

He shook his head. “Just won- 
dering when we’re going to find out 
about the FIAT workers, that’s all. 
Regardless of how it’s caused or 



COX’S QUALITY 



47 




what it's called, results are what 
count.” 

"But it’s interesting. Bob,” Hol- 
denian said in defense of his incur- 
sion into theory. 

Ndolo continued to look at Dr. 
Gold. She in turn waited for more 
questions, but then decided that 
the African’s remark had moved 
discussion to a practical level. They 
wanted her to go on, were doubtless 
afraid of more digressions. 

“All right, then,” she said. “The 
poor workers took on the work per- 
sonality of the better ones. Their 
production picked up, absenteeism 
fell, theft dropped off.” 

“Ah.” Demchenko exhaled in 
relief. “We maybe have something 
here.” 

“Yeah, Viktor,” Castenero said. 
“Maybe you will be lucky and they 
will give you my personality.” 

“You joke,” Demchenko said 
seriously. 

"No. No joke.” 

Demchenko sat up straight and 
pulled down his cummerbund over 
his round stomach. His moon face 
had a hurt look. 

“I have a perfectly good per- 
sonality," he said. 

“Of course you have, Viktor. 
Very nice,” Abbassi said with a 
hard look at Castenero. Demchen- 
ko looked around to see if the 
others agreed. 

“Come, come, gentlemen.” Bles- 
sing tapped his notaboard. 

“So, Dr. Gold,” Peng put in as if 
he had not been aware of the 



hiatus, “what you seem to be saying 
is that we have the means to revolu- 
tionize the world’s work force. Is 
that correct?” 

Dr. Gold traced a circle with her 
stylus and said with a shrug. “It 
seems so." 

“Not the world’s work force,” 
bbassi cut in. “Ours.” 

“Ours?” Peng echoed. He seem- 
ed startled. 

“You said the world's work 
force," Abbassi explained. 

“Ah, I see.” Peng made a slight 
motion of dismissal. “Ours — the 
world’s — the same work force, is it 
not?" 

“Of course, of course.” Abbassi 
slumped in his chair, as though it 
were no longer important to him to 
be understood. 

Castenero chuckled, reached 
under the curve of the table and 
slapped Abbassi’s knee. Peng look- 
ed at them both without curiosity. 

“Well, then to get on with it,” 
Holdeman said, “I move we direct 
sci to find our best workers, print 
them and lay it onto the lousy 
workers.” His thoughts began to 
take flight at the concept. “We 
could run production contests and 
use the winners as the models, as 
the analogues. Give them a bonus, 
too, of course." 

A murmur of approval ran 
around the room. Perhaps today 
would be an easy day, an early day, 
an extra-martini-before-dinner day. 

“No, gentlemen,” Dr. Gold said 
sternly. They were so determined to 



48 



GALAXY 




be ordinary, she thought. “It isn’t 
(hat simple.” 

Silent groans of “I knew it" 
floated up like ectoplasm and they 
sank back, waiting once more. 

“Don’t forget, I said Cox’s 
Quality has nothing to do with in- 
telligence,” she went on. “After all, 
some of our best sensitives are 
morons. It also has nothing to do 
with strength or dexterity or good 
vision or almost anything else you 
can ask of a worker. It’s really quite 
limited. It shapes our attitude 
toward the world and its impres- 
sions, not much more. Therefore, 
the winner of a contest may have 
won because of strength, dexterity, 
better vision, and a hundred other 
things our ECIP won’t affect. In 
other ways he could even be a 
psychological monster that would 
turn our stomachs.” 

“But you said at FIAT — ?” Togo 
asked the question many were 
thinking. 

She nodded. “Yes, the ana- 
logues, as Mr. Holdeman called 
them, were picked very carefully 
and on a limited basis. Even there 
one or two got through with traits 
that weren’t evident or desirable. 
These had nothing visibly to do 
with their work and attitudes but 
were not what we would want to 
spread to others.” 

“Example?” Holdeman asked 
quickly. 

She hesitated, fumbled with her 
collar and reddened slightly. “Well, 
for example, I understand one man 



proved to be a secret transvestite.” 

T here was a long pause and 
then a guffaw. Peng cleared his 
throat and motioned for quiet. He 
got it. 

“But it is theoretically possible to 
succeed,” he said. 

“Of course,” Dr. Gold agreed. 
“It is then a matter of finding the 
right analogues, a matter of proper 
screening, vetting, if you will.” 
“That’s it,” Holdeman said. 
“We just have to be careful in selec- 
tion — you people in scr have to be 
careful in selection, that is.” He 
finished lamely. 

“Yes, that’s possible.” Dr. Gold 
said calmly. “We could without 
doubt find such people. But then 
what?” 

“What, what?” Demchenko ask- 
ed, moisture beading his bald 
head. He looked around as if to 
ask, “Is it me?” 

"Simply this, Mr. Demchenko. 
We imprint the poor workers and 
they become like the best — at least 
in terms of attitude and motivation. 
What becomes of the mediocre 
workers?" 

“Print them,” Holdeman said 
confidently. Several nodded. 

“And then that factory becomes 
the best and gets the bonuses and 
the free vacations to Colorado 
Springs or Ischia or Sochi or Bali,” 
she went oh, “and the others in the 
other factories see this and — ” 
“Print them too.” Holdeman 
started to say this briskly but the 



COX’S QUALITY 



49 




‘them’ came out slowly and the 
‘too’ extended itself on and on like 
an ooh of pain. The others were 
stunned too as their plan’s implica- 
tions hit them. 

"You see,” Gold said in satisfac- 
tion. Take that, you little men! 

‘‘Yes, yes,” Peng said. ‘‘Very 
clear.” 

Holdeman was twitching in his 
chair with exasperation. Her su- 
periority, which showed so clearly 
now, had gotten to him. 

“All right, you win,” he said. 

“It is not a matter of winning or 
losing as far as I am concerned,” 
she said loftily, but of course it was. 
“It is a question of how to use the 
Imprinter. How do we prevent in- 
equality? How do we prevent 
strikes and riots? How do we pre- 
vent resentment against the ana- 
logues? How do we keep the mal- 
adjusted, non-imprinted, from tak- 
ing advantage of the adjusted im- 
printed? Finally,” and here she 
dragged out her words as if each 
were printed on a separate card, 
“where is that person you would 
want to be your analogue? That is 
the question we will eventually have 
to face, if you so decide.” 

They sat in morose silence, 
visions of happy, productive, unde- 
manding workers, interchangeable 
human parts for the uncart 
machine, gone glimmering like all 
good things. Dr. Gold was enjoying 
this. She had set them up, reduced 
them to helplessness. Now she 
would help them. 



“I have brought someone I would 
like you to hear.” 

One by one they came up out of 
the depths. At least, they thought, 
there will be an answer. Good sci. 
Good Gold. 

She went to the monitor’s booth 
and arranged to have the one door 
opened. 

An extremely tall, thin, brown- 
skinned man stepped into the con- 
ference room. He acted dazzled 
and bewildered, like a person 
coming on stage for the first time. 
To the Directors, this was the nor- 
mal reaction. This room and what 
it represented had humbled many 
men. On the other hand, perhaps 
the visitor was merely dazzled by 
the change in light. The room was, 
indeed, very bright. 

“Gentlemen,” Dr. Gold said 
loudly, “may I present Dr. N. K. 
Lakhshman of Delhi University 

SCI.” 

Now it appeared that merely the 
dazzlement had caused his con- 
fusion. His eyes adjusted and he 
looked around through his tinted 
glasses with assurance. 

“Dr. Lakhshman is with sci/es- 
cat,” Dr. Gold continued. She 
quickly raised her hand in a little 
admonitory gesture as she saw the 
question lights go on in their eyes. 
“escat is, of course, sci’s branch 
of eschatology.” She anticipated 
the next question. “Eschatology is 
an antiquated word to cover a 
somewhat primitive religious con- 
cept. It literally means dealing with 



50 



GALAXY 




last things, death and resurrec- 
tion.” 

The still mysterious Dr. Lakhsh- 
man made a contribution. “Yes,” 
he said, “it comes, I believe, from 
the Greek, eschatos, which means 
furthest.” 

My God, some thought. Again 
another pigeonhole we didn't know 
existed. But one had to have faith. 
After all you didn’t have to know all 
the parts of a pulse air car to drive 
it. As managers they had to believe 
that they transcended the minutiae 
of the business. Big-picture men, 
all. 

‘‘All right,” Holdeman said 
quickly, still annoyed. “You’ve told 
us more about the word than we 
care to know. Now what is sci/es- 
cat and what’s he — ” he started to 
point, but then thought better of 
it — “Dr. Lakhshman been invited 
for?” 

“Of course, of course,” Dr. Gold 
said placidly and went on in her 
own way. “We will get to that. 
But first another word about 
sci/escat. It is really an outgrowth 
of sci/extrap — ” 

Demchenko sighed and wiped 
his head. He muttered in Russian. 

“ — which stood for extrapola- 
tion, a word I’m sure you gentle- 
men are familiar with.” 

They all nodded brazenly, with- 
out embarrassment. 

<4 r T ,HESE units of sci,” she went 
JL on unhurried, ‘‘were sup- 
posed to keep an eye on the broad 



range of sci developments, see 
where they were headed, how they 
fitted together and, in a sense, pre- 
dict what areas of sci would be 
most fruitful. In short, keep an 
overview. Is this clear?” 

Again they nodded. She had 
them well under control now. 
Lakhshman stood aside, arms fold- 
ed, wearing a smile of satisfaction. 
This was his moment and well de- 
served too, he thought. Ability had 
at last been appreciated. They 
knew who he was at the Tehran 
Hilton where he occupied one of 
sci’s suites for distinguished visi- 
tors. uncart owned the hotel, of 
course, and so was not really out of 
pocket, but then there had been the 
deluxe ticket on South Asian Inter- 
national from Delhi. They, too, 
had known who he was. uncart 
owned the airline. 

And the special reception com- 
mittee from sci and sec that had 
met him at the airport, they had 
known him, had taken his bags, 
ushered him through the VIP 
lounge. 

Dr. Gold was still talking. 

‘‘Extrapolation was fine, but 
rather short-range, particularly 
with the people we had in the old 
extrap units. They were primarily 
one-discipline persons who talked 
to each other and pooled ideas. 
With the rapid advances we were 
making, that simply wasn’t 
enough.” 

She looked around the table but 
they avoided her gaze. 



COX’S QUALITY

“Well, then, to continue. One of 
my first ideas, when I became Chief 
sci, was to create a new group of 
people, a small group, who would 
go far beyond the limits set for 
extrap. I conceived of the group as 
small, only one or two in each 
cart/sci, educated in many dis- 
ciplines and thinking in, in — ” she 
groped for a word, and then she 
had it — “in cosmic terms about 
science and where it was going and 
should go as a whole, not as a col- 
lection of independent studies. 
Science has a will, an imperative of 
its own, and escat was created by 
me to read this imperative. 

“Dr. Lakhshman, here, is the 
product of my idea. How many ad- 
vanced degrees do you have. Doc- 
tor? Six?” 

Lakhshman gave a little depre- 
catory wave of the hand. “Eight, 
last time I counted.” 

Both scientists laughed. The Di- 
rectors regarded them but said 
nothing. Again the stylus pointed. 

Reinholt Blessing, the shir of 
time in his ears, wondered if he 
would be retired before it was all 
decided. He tapped lightly, almost 
absentmindedly, on the table. 

“Of course, Mr. Chairman,” 
Gold said. “We must indeed press 
on. Dr. Lakhshman is here because 
he has put his great abilities to the 
consideration of the EC1P and what 
it means. What is its imperative, so 
to speak. As he sees it, and I must 
say all of us in SCI agree, there are 
only two alternatives — two, gentle- 



men, only — and these are dichoto- 
mous. It is up to you to choose. 
After you have heard Dr. Lakhsh- 
man I think you will agree that the 
imperative leads us only to full ex- 
ploitation of the ECIP.” She turned 
to the Indian with a stiff swing of 
the body. The Directors could al- 
most see her settle into the carpet 
another half thread’s length. 

Lakshman stepped forward and 
again folded his arms. 

<4 , T ,HANK y 0U ’ Dr. Gold.Gentle- 
X men, let me summarize at 
the outset what I conceive the posi- 
tion of the ECIP to be. Dr. Gold 
has touched on the difficulties of 
imprinting selected people with the 
Quality prints of others. Jealousies 
will arise, have arisen in some of 
our experiments, hard feelings 
against the patterns, the uncer- 
tainty of bad side effects, the fact 
that maladjusted non-imprinted 
people can and will take advantage 
of, even persecute, the imprinted — 
in short, all the difficulties of 
creating an elite group among the 
non-elite. That has never worked 
throughout history. It is the stuff 
that martyrs are made of.” 

“Pardon, Dr. Lakhshman,” To- 
go cut in, “if I understand you, we 
have very little to decide.” 

“On the contrary, sir. I beg your 
pardon, I am not used to such illus- 
trious company and I do not know 
your name — ” 

“Togo, nipcart.” The Director 



52 



GALAXY 




half rose and bowed as he intro- 
duced himself. 

“Ah, yes. On the contrary, Mr. 
Togo, you have it in your hands to 
put in action the greatest step man 
has yet taken.” 

The Directors muttered and 
turned to each other. They wree 
mostly methodical men and wanted 
no part of any great step for 
humanity. Dr. Gold caught this. 

“We are not trying to be dra- 
matic,” she said. “We are merely 
asking you to consider what ap- 
pears to be a perfectly logical next 
step.” She put on her stiff, reas- 
suring smile. 

“Yes, logical,” Lakhshman hur- 
ried on. “Certainly logical, but im- 
mensely important, historic.” 

Dr. Gold groaned to herself. Her 
creature was being carried away by 
his vision to the detriment of the 
argument. With his eyes firmly on 
El Dorado he was missing the 
poisoned waterholes between him- 
self and the goal. 

“All right, then. Doctor,” Holde- 
man said, “what are we supposed 
to be historic about? What is the 
great step?” 

Gold tried to stop him, her body 
lurched forward, still firmly screw- 
ed to the floor, her mouth opened — 
but too late — 

“Why, why, to imprint the 
world,” Lakhshman said excitedly, 
like a camp preacher with the 
word. 

The Directors sat up as if their 
seats were wired and then slumped 



as the switch was cut. They were 
silent for some seconds. Even 
Lakhshman seemed stunned by 
the enormity of what had slipped 
out of him. This wasn’t going ac- 
cording to the game plan he had 
worked out with Dr. Gold. He 
could tell this, too, from looking at 
her. 

“It’s an old joke,” Castenero 
chuckled, “but I could swear he 
said, imprint the world’.” 

“That is exactly what he said,” 
Peng stated. 

Blessing heaved a deep sigh and 
held up his hand. 

“Please, please,” he said, “Dr. 
Gold, Dr. Lakhshman, I believe we 
are getting involved in dramatics. 
Would you please explain calmly 
and factually what you have in 
mind?” 

“Certainly.” Gold said. “Dr. 
Lakhshman will make everything 
clear.” She turned to him. “Go 
ahead. Doctor. As we agreed.” 

H e caught her meaning and 
proceeded cautiously. 

“As I see it,” he went on slowly, 
“we are at a crossroads. As we have 
learned, it appears impossible, 
dangerous, to use the ECIP in more 
than a very limited way. Therefore 
the alternative is to use it all the 
way, on everyone. That way man’s 
personality will be unified, there 
will be no jealousies, none higher 
than another. In emotional terms, 
there will be no cruel to persecute 
the meek. Man will enter an era of

unprecedented tranquility. This is 
what science has been working 
toward since the pyramids.” 

In this subdued incarnation 
Lakhshman was being more effec- 
tive. Gold watched the watchers 
closely and she was pleased. 

‘‘And the other fork in the 
road?" Abbassi asked. 

Lakshman dismissed it with a 
casual wave. 

“Merely limited brain repair. In- 
stead of the cutting and blood of a 
lobotomy we could imprint the se- 
verely maladjusted. Mechanic’s 
work. A tragic waste of a heaven- 
sent gift.” 

“It is then,” Abbassi sighed, “all 
or nothing — or almost nothing, 
very little.” 

Lakhshman nodded. “Yes, that 
is close to it, but it is not a frighten- 
ing prospect. It is a glorious pros- 
pect.” 

Dr. Gold entered the discussion 
in an unexpected vein. 

“Gentlemen, what we propose 
will make the world happier, a 
better place to live in. We will all be 
happier. We will enjoy life more. 
The little irritations will be gone. 
My God, that has been a goal 
throughout history.” 

"Yes,” Lakhshman added, “we 
cannot make men into gods, nor 
perhaps even saints, but we can 
make them finer than they are.” 

The Directors sat glumly, con- 
sidering. There wasn’t one among 
them who was prepared for this, 
who wanted to decide any such 



thing. Did even uncart have such 
a right? 

“It is our duty,” Lakhshman 
said. 

Finally Togo put a question. 
“You said everyone. Do you really 
mean — ?’’ 

“Everyone,” Dr. Gold said. “All 
or nothing.” 

“Everyone?” Demchenko said, 
swiveling his bald head around the 
room. 

She nodded and Demchenko 
slumped. 

“Of course,” Peng said. “Of 
course.” 

After another minute Holdeman 
started the practical dialogue 
again. 

“But is it practical?” he asked. 
“Six billion people — ” 

“Six billion, seventy-nine million, 
give or take a million,” Lakhshman 
said. “Oh, it’s practical. I have it 
worked out. Of course, we won’t 
reach every last person. There will 
be Eskimos or Yetis or wild men 
somewhere that we miss, but that 
won’t matter. The effective popula- 
tion can be imprinted.” 

“You said you had it worked 
out,” Peng said. “Please eluci- 
date.” 

Lakhshman had it worked out all 
right, no doubt about that, and he 
spent the next fifteen minutes ex- 
plaining how it could be done. The 
computer confirmed him. The 
room darkened and charts came on 
showing the Directors the answers 
in oversimplified wiring diagrams

and stick people, the kind used in 
demonstrations for children. It was 
plain, it was simple, it was good. 
The statistics had come from 
uncart/pers, another cachet of 
surety. 

Lakhshman was planning to use 
ten thousand imprinting teams. 
This meant that each one of the 
teams would only have to imprint 
about six hundred thousand people. 
Each imprinter could be built to 
take connections for one thousand 
people at full power. Therefore, 
each team would only have to 
imprint six hundred batches. 

"That’s an average of less than 
(wo batches a day if we are to finish 
in a year,” Lakhshman said com- 
fortably. “Of course, the daily run 
would be higher since the process 
only takes two hours from be- 
ginning to end." 

However, he went on, allowing 
for uncart/sec to gather the 
people, travel time, slippage, 
equipment problems and other 
difficulties, an average of two 
batches a day was comfortable and 
could be lived with. 

‘‘But, my God,” Demchenko 
said, “ten thousand teams! Where 
can we find all those people?” 

L akhshman smiled reassuringly 
j and gave his standard soft hand 
wave, an intellectual brush-off. Dr. 
Gold smiled with him like a 
conspirator. 

“Dear sir," Lakhshman said, 
pronouncing ‘sir’ something like 



sorr. “we have taken it all into ac- 
count, I assure you. All has been 
thought out.” 

He explained to them that the 
word team was almost a misnomer. 
One person could use the im- 
printer, could in fact do the job. 
However, a team of two had been 
decided upon in case of illness, or 
other unforeseen problems. 

“Besides,” he went on, “it is 
useful to have one person just to ob- 
serve the subjects. Some people, a 
very small minority, I might add, 
do not stand imprintation very well 
and must be stopped.” 

“But that would defeat the pur- 
pose, would it not?” Togo asked. 

Lakhshman looked serious as if 
the gentleman’s question was a 
good one and merited considera- 
tion, but his guns were already 
cocked. 

“But such a tiny minority, sir, an 
infinitesimal group. They would 
stand with the Eskimos and Sas- 
quatch that aren’t worth pursuing.” 

“But all the same,” Castenero 
insisted, “he has a point. One or 
two mean ones could ruin a whole 
factory.” 

Again the smile of beatitude. 

“Fear not, sir,” Lakhshman said 
melodramatically, “we have already 
considered ways of dealing with 
such people.” 

Dr. Gold spoke. “I don’t believe 
we have to go into that here. Suffice 
it to say that uncart/sec has as- 
sured me that this small group of 
people will not infect the rest.” 



COX’S QUALITY 



55 




“Isolation?” Holdeman asked. 

“Something of the nature,” she 
said. “I trust sec to take care of 
such things. I have Mr. Paul’s as- 
surance.” 

Most of the Directors nodded 
and relaxed. Mr. Paul was Chief, 
uncart/sec. Let him handle it. 
Better not to go into a thoroughly 
specialized field. 

“I understand then that twenty 
thousand people will be required,” 
Peng said. “Is that correct?” 

“Quite correct,” Lakhshman 
answered. 

“And where are so many to come 
from?” 

Lakhshman explained that each 
of the sci/psy subunits would 
supply two thousand people or in 
total enough for eight thousand im- 
printing teams. 

“And the rest?” Peng asked. 

Dr. Gold answered for Lakhsh- 
man. 

“We here at sci/psy headquar- 
ters can supply the remainder of 
four thousand people. Enough for 
two thousand teams.” 

There was quiet for a moment 
and then Abbassi spoke up in a 
mixture of surprise and alarm. 

“We have that many people 
here?” 

“Of course,” said Dr. Gold, 
looking at him strangely. 

Abbassi shook his head in won- 
derment as Lakhshman went on 
with the details. Teams could be as- 
sembled, ready for training, in a 
month to six weeks. After that. 



three months would be needed for 
the actual training period. 

“That is, if you give the go-ahead 
today,” Lakhshman added. “Any 
delay will, of course, lengthen 
matters.” 

“Gentlemen,” Dr. Gold moved 
in again. “I have here some tenta- 
tive scheduling of teams and dates 
which I will pass out to show you 
how simply and efficiently the pro- 
ject can be worked.” 

The men glanced over the papers 
she handed them. Most of them 
looked glum. They were faced with 
more than they cared to consider 
and they could not quite escape the 
feeling, either, that sci was rail- 
roading the proposition. Their in- 
stincts told them, whoa, dig in a 
bit. 

“I notice,” Togo said, “that 
there is a strange distribution of im- 
printing teams. Those from my 
area, for example, are to go to 
USCART. SINCART teams to AMCART, 

sovcart teams to eurocart — ” 

Dr. Gold held up her hand. 

“Yes, yes,” she said. “All teams 
are assigned to other than their 
home areas. We think it best to 
keep the procedure as impersonal 
as possible.” 

Togo nodded slowly. The explan- 
ation had been logical. 

The silence was incomplete. 
There was some shuffling and 
rattling of paper, much useless 
marking on notaboards. Plainly 
they did not want to make a de- 
cision. They could not forget that 



56 



GALAXY 




when they said “all,” all it would 
be, themselves included. Dr. Gold 
swiveled impatiently. Lakhshman 
appealed to her with his spaniel 
eyes. She cleared her throat. 

The dreamy glaze faded from 
Blessing’s face. He said sadly, 
“Gentlemen, we must decide.” 

They nodded but no one spoke. 
This went on for some minutes 
without change in tempo, as though 
it would continue indefinitely, eight 
Directors sitting, hoping, aging, as 
one day succeeded another, still 
without a decision, or even the 
summoned will to try to make a de- 
cision. 

Dr. Gold and Lakhshman smiled 
at one another like felons. This too 
had been expected and prepared 
for. 

“If I may make a suggestion,” 
she said. 

I nstantly the Directors were 
alert. Hope, fond salvation, per- 
haps release — ah. They waited ex- 
pectantly for this burden to be 
taken from them. 

“Since it will take six weeks to 
assemble the teams and then three 
more months to train them, we can 
undertake a small pilot program to 
test the — to conform the feasibility 
of the idea. We can have a tentative 
result after six weeks before we 
start training in volume and com- 
plete results after the training 
period.” 

Ah, they thought again, relief, 
delay — ah. 



“But you have already tried it,” 
Peng said practically, and the 
others frowned at him. 

“Quite true,” Gold said. “We 
have tried it on selected people but 
not on selected communities. 
Whole communities would give us a 
closer approximation of the fu- 
ture.” 

“Yes, 1 see," Peng said. “Very 
true. Sound as a dollar.” 

She explained carefully that 
three plants and associated com- 
munities would serve as test areas. 
The sites had already been chosen. 
All were relatively isolated and 
therefore easy for sec to seal off 
and monitor, assuring an uncon- 
taminated test. 

“Also,” Gold added, almost as 
afterthought, “if anything goes 
wrong the situation can easily be 
controlled.” 

The three factories chosen were: 
the Lockheed/Sud Aviation/Marcel 
Dassault plant near Brasilia, the 
Goodyear/Michelin/Chemex plant 
in Central Africa, and the ICl/At- 
las/Farben/Dupont plant near 
Dizful, Iran. 

The old names of commerce sur- 
vived under uncart, strung out 
like memory beads. Once uncart 
had established itself, it put an end 
to all the uncertainties, the bank- 
ruptcies, the failures, in commerce 
and industry. Companies could be 
combined, streamlined, recon- 
structed, but they could not go 
under. The old names gave uncart 
a sense of continuity and legiti-

macy, made them the rightful heirs 
to the throne. 

“Sounds good to me," Holdeman 
said, clearly expressing the concen- 
sus. The others murmured their 
agreement. 

“We do agree then, gentlemen?” 
Blessing asked. Seven heads 
nodded. Some looked at their 
watches. Two or three yawned and 
pushed their chairs back. 

“Fine. Thank you, gentlemen,” 
Dr. Goid said. She paused and 
looked around. 

Ill 

^rwiHERE is one final thing to 
X consider.” 

They looked at her incredulous- 
ly. They couldn’t believe it. She was 
like a dentist saying they still had 
time to take care of one more 
cavity. 

“And, and, and that is?” Dem- 
chenko stuttered. 

“Simply who is to be the ana- 
logue.” she said quickly. 

They hadn’t thought of that. The 
gloom returned, deeper than ever. 
Lakhshman looked at them idly, 
curiously. 

“Surely, you have a suggestion,” 
Ndolo said from behind that strong- 
nosed bastion of a face. Dr. Gold 
did not notice his irritation, or 
appeared not to. 

“Yes, of course,” she said. “It is 
sci’s duty to present complete 
packages to the Directors.” She 
surveyed them through her huge 



glasses, as if screening for disagree- 
ment. Then when satisfied there was 
none, she relaxed. 

“1 will let Dr. Lakhshman ex- 
plain,” she concluded. 

He smiled and nodded his head 
in a truncated bow. 

"As you know,” he said, “a real 
analogue must be used. We cannot 
create one artificially or contrive 
one tVom parts. We must have an 
ECP print of a brain that is ideal in 
every respect we can measure for 
mankind as a whole.” 

“And for us, too, gentlemen,” 
Gold put in. “We can’t forget 
that.” 

No, they hadn’t forgotten that 
and they nodded morosely. That 
was the problem. How could you 
order your own personality changed 
when you were perfectly satisfied 
with the one you had? But the thing 
had a logic that was inescapable. 

“All right,” Holdeman said with 
a sigh, “who is it? Surely you have 
someone in mind.” 

Dr. Gold and Lakhshman both 
started speaking at the same time. 
They looked at each other and he 
deferred. 

“Yes,” she said, “as I said, sci 
always presents a complete pack- 
age. That is our job.” 

It was Lakhshman who conclud- 
ed the announcement. He said 
simply, “Thors Thorsen.” 

“Thorsen!" several Directors said 
at once. 

The two scientists merely 
nodded. 



58 



GALAXY 




“But he’s dead,” Castenero said. 

“We printed him shortly before 
he died,” Lakhshman informed 
them. 

“1 might add,” Gold said, “that 
his being dead is one more reason 
for choosing him.” 

Certainly Thorsen was a good 
choice and the more the Directors 
thought about it the less reason 
they had to disagree. Thorsen, a 
brilliant Icelander, had made out- 
standing contributions in many 
scientific fields. He had also been 
an excellent poet and painter. 

In middle age he had given up 
his main works to go to the still 
relatively remote areas of New 
Guinea to live among the natives. 
He had set up a hospital and spent 
long years healing the sick. At the 
same time, periodically, a work of 
his humanist philosophy would be 
flown out of the bush to the expec- 
tant hands of his admirers. 

His writing reflected what must 
have been an exceptional persona- 
lity, one of great kindness, inner 
peace and harmony, yet possessed 
of an energy and drive few could 
match. Thorsen had been acclaim- 
ed a genius while he lived, a genius 
with many of the characteristics of 
a saint. In short, if the world were 
to have a common personality what 
better than Thorsen? 

Gold and Lakhshman studied 
the Directors in silence. They could 
almost see the mental wheels 
turning. They could see the still 
useless struggles against the inevi- 



table. And because they knew it 
was inevitable they could afford to 
be quiet. 

“All right,” Ndolo said at last. 
“All right. All right.” 

“Gentlemen?” Blessing asked 
once more. 

“There is no one better,” Peng 
said. 

“If we have to — ” Castenero 
said. 

“Okay,” said Holdeman. 

“Let me add,” Dr. Gold cut in, 
“because he is from Iceland there 
should be little or no national jea- 
lousy.” 

“Of Iceland?” Castenero 
chuckled. 

“A good point,” Peng added. 
“Not kind, perhaps, but a good 
point.” 

T hey were all nodding by this 
time and so it was settled. 

“If I may clarify now,” Blessing 
said. “Just so there will be no mis- 
understanding, beginning now sci 
will start imprinting the workers 
and related civilians in the three 
factory areas we have named. The 
ECP print of Thorsen, the late — ” 
Blessing bowed his head slightly — 
“will be used as the analogue for 
these people. In the meantime, sci 
will gather the people who will be 
trained to form the imprinting 
teams. Right so far. Dr. Gold?” 
“Quite correct, Mr. Chairman.” 
“This gathering,” Blessing went 
on, “will take six weeks. At that 
time we will be given a tentative 



COX’S QUALITY 



59 




progress report from the test areas. 
The training of the teams will take 
about three more months, after 
which we — ” He paused and a look 
of sudden grief wrinkled his face 
like a physical pain. He controlled 
himself and went on. “ — after 
which the Directors will recieve a 
final report from the control sites. 
On the basis of that, the Directors 
will decide whether or not to go 
ahead with the whole program.” 

“An excellent summary,” Lakh- 
shman said. 

They turned to the Chairman for 
a sign to leave. Their business was 
now over. Blessing sat staring at his 
notaboard. At last he spoke. 

“Sorry, gentlemen. I was think- 
ing how much I will miss being here 
when you hear those reports and 
make those decisions.” 

The statement was obviously sin- 
cere and somewhat sad. 

“But, Blessing,” Abbassi said, 
“the rules allow an ex-Chairman to 
sit in on meetings. He cannot vote, 
of course, but — ” 

“No, no,” Blessing said, “it is 
not done. It is better so.” Then he 
brightened. “Well, let us have, 
some Beluga.” 

The mood changed. The Direc- 
tors filed out noisily, almost like 
schoolboys. They headed for the 
bar where caviar and vodka awaited 
them. 

Because the Headquarters of un- 
cart was in Iran the Directors had 
decided some years before to revive 
the almost extinct Caspian caviar 



industry. Through the cooperation 
of sovcart/sci/eco/fish and as- 
cart/sci/eco/fish the Caspian 
was cleaned up, its level restored 
and its waters restocked with stur- 
geon. Now the Directors’ cocktail 
tables bore large iced bowls of 
Beluga and of Golden, the caviar of 
Shahs. They spooned the caviar 
of Shahs. They spooned the 
caviar liberally onto buttered toast, 
squeezed lemon on the spread. 
They nibbled greedily, licking their 
fingers and washing down the treat 
with iced vodka, Makhsous for the 
persophile and Stolichnaya for the 
purist. 

IV 

T ime went by. The Directors said 
goodbye to their old Chairman 
and seated their new: Chen Tsing 
Peng. Blessing’s place as- Director 
from eurocart was taken by 
Lennox Brown, and Englishman. 

It was now the middle of 
summer. The great sun floated in 
the cloudless Persian sky like a 
burnished copper tray. The air was 
dry, desert dry. Even when they 
strolled through the gardens out- 
side the temperature-controlled 
buildings, the Directors did not feel 
especially uncomfortable. The 
combination of hot dry air and 
cloudless, perfectly blue skies made 
their aches disappear and their 
spirits rise. 

The day came for Dr. Gold’s 
interim report to the Directors. 



60 



GALAXY 




After they had settled themselves 
around the table Dr. Gold came in 
towing a small man behind her like 
the Coast Guard rescuing a canoe. 
Some, but not all, of the Directors 
knew him. The new man, Brown, 
turned to Ndolo with a question but 
received only a muttered answer 
which he didn’t understand. 

Dr. Gold solved the problem. 

“I believe you know Mr. William 
Ho,” she said. ‘‘Chief/uNCART/ 

PERS/STAT.” 

Physically Ho was tiny. He stood 
barely five feet tall and could not 
have weighed a hundred pounds. If 
not for his graying hair he might 
have been taken at a quick glance 
for a child. In introducing him, 
Gold had stepped forward and had 
disappeared behind her, almost as 
though through a conjuring trick. 
She had to look around for him to 
conclude the introduction. 

“As you know, the initial six- 
week trial period of our imprinting 
project is now over. Mr. Ho is here 
with the latest statistics from the 
pilot areas. I believe you will be 
gratified by what he has to say.” 

Ho turned his little finger toward 
her in annoyance. He was piqued 
because she had given away the 
burden of his message. All that was 
left were dry statistics. He looked 
up at her bulk like a climber 
surveying the Matterhorn. She 
appeared not to notice. He turned 
back to the Directors, stiff-legged, 
if possible even more doll-like. 

“As Dr. Gold has told you,” he 



began, “I have here the statistics 
from the three pilot plants. I know 
you gentlemen are busy so I will get 
to the heart of the matter.” 

He lifted the sheet of paper, 
folded lengthwise, that he had been 
holding at his side and read aloud 
quickly. 

“At the Dassault plant near Bra- 
silia in the five-week period since 
the workers were imprinted with 
the Thorsen print, absenteeism has 
virtually disappeared. Production 
is up twelve percent and worker 
attitude has improved sixty-three 
percent, according to amcart/sci/ 
psy. An excellent result. In the 
Michelin factory in Central Africa, 
during approximately the same 
period, absenteeism has been re- 
duced by half, production is up 
twenty-five percent and theft, as- 
tonishingly, has nearly vanished.” 

He paused to editorialize. 

‘‘I might say that these last 
figures are all the more startling 
because that particular plant was 
one of the worst in afcart, a bad 
area for laziness, drunkenness and 
thievery.” 

“I beg your pardon,” Ndolo said, 
banging the table. 

‘‘All right,” Castenero said, 
seriously for him, “don’t get work- 
ed up, Bob. He didn’t mean any- 
thing.” 

“That’s right,” Holdeman said, 
“bigger things are at stake. But, 
Ho,” he went on, “no more refer- 
ences that could be misconstrued, 
if you know what I mean.”

“Certainly.” Ho rose on his little 
feet. “I am merely stating facts. 
That is my job. Unfortunately, the 
curse of nationalism is still — ” 
“Ho!” Peng cut him off sharply. 
“Of course.” Ho flushed and 
went on. “As I was saying the 
figures are striking. For the Dupont 
plant in Dizful the results are 
equally good. Absenteeism gone, 
production up thirty-three percent, 
attitude over seventy percent better, 
theft zero. Remarkable.” 

“Well, Dr. Gold,” Peng said, 
“would you say we have a success?” 

44¥ Tndoubtedly,” s h e sa *d. 

%J“The figures speak for 
themselves.” 

“Then, gentlemen,” Peng went 
on, “do we agree that the im- 
printing teams may start their 
training, with deployment in three 
months at the latest?” 

Peng looked from one to the 
other and each nodded. He came to 
Abbassi, who made no gesture 
whatever. Peng coaxed him. “It 
will be very good for uncart.” 
“But will it be good for the 
world?” Abbassi asked seriously. 

Silence fell on this vast irrele- 
vancy. There were embarrassed 
coughs and foot shufflings. Ah, 
well, they thought, Abbassi was 
Persian and bound to be a bit 
quixotic. But a good head, all the 
same. 

"I believe that is what we were 
talking about,” Demchenko said at 
last. 



“Quite,” the Chairman said. He 
watched Abbassi, who nodded 
sadly at last. Peng continued. “I 
believe we can move on now. Very 
well, Dr. Gold, you may give the 
order to commence training.” 
“Thank you,” she said content- 
edly. 

“But there will be another report 
from the pilot plants in three 
months, will there not?” 

“If you think it is necessary,” she 
said, not so contentedly. 

“I believe that was our agree- 
ment. Better safe than sorry.” 

“As you say,” Gold said. “But 
there will be no change. There will 
be improvement, if anything.” 

“All the same.” 

“Quite,” she ended the dialogue. 
She sailed out the door, towing Mr. 
Ho, just as she had entered. The 
door slid shut with a whoosh. 

Peng said, once she had gone, 
“Now that we are alone, may I sug- 
gest that Doctor Gold is probably 
right. The report three months 
from now should cause no change 
in our plans. I see no need to call a 
general meeting at that time.” 
“You are sure?” Togo question- 
ed. 

“The chairman is supposed to re- 
lieve his fellows of as much routine 
work as possible. This next report 
will certainly be routine.” 

“And?” Castenero asked this 
time. 

“If results are as expected I will 
consider the report and give the 
order for deployment. No point in a 



62 



GALAXY 




meeting. Besides, one or two of you 
are talking of taking leave at that 
time. You, for example, Fer- 
nando.” 

“Yes, that’s true,” Castenero 
said. “Well, it’s okay with me.” 

“1 don’t see why not,” Holdeman 
said. 

“Yes, yes,” Demchenko added. 
"No need to bother us.” 

And so it was agreed. As they 
filed out they gossiped among 
themselves, as usual, but Abbassi 
hung back, thinking, clinging to 
this moment before the project was 
underway. 

But. all the same, he thought, 
will it be good for us? 

V 

I t was now autumn in Tehran. 

The air was still warm and the 
skies clear, but occasionally clouds 
gathered over the mountains and 
peaks disappeared into thunder 
and lightning, like brown castings 
worked in a forge. This was a sign 
of the weeks to come when the rain 
would become a daily affair, pour- 
ing in sheets, running in freshets 
down Iran’s bare hills and scouring 
its desert. The snow on Demavand 
that had nearly disappeared was al- 
ready being refreshed, the brilliant 
white shine of it standing out 
clearly against the malted tan of the 
old. 

It was a quiet period for uncart 
and, as Peng had suggested, some 
of the Directors were not in 



Tehran. Castenero was in Aca- 
pulco. Togo was sunning himself in 
Hawaii. Holdeman was diving at 
Juan les Pins. Demchenko was at a 
resort in Yalta. 

Thus half the board was gone. 
Only Peng, Brown, Ndolo and 
Abbassi were in town, Peng be- 
cause he took his chairmanship 
seriously, Brown because he was 
still new and wanted to appear at 
least to pull his weight, Ndolo be- 
cause he had nowhere in particular 
to go. As for Abbassi, his home was 
Tehran. 

On the day of Dr. Gold’s three- 
month report, Peng went early to 
his office, Ndolo took to the hills 
for some shooting. Brown sat at 
home reading back reports and 
Abbassi packed his family on a 
picnic to the Caspian. However, the 
four assembled at sixteen hundred 
to hear Dr. Gold. Peng had 
summoned them somewhat hur- 
riedly and unexpectedly. Tomorrow 
the teams were to start on their 
way. 

As soon as Dr. Gold appeared 
they could see that something was 
wrong. She looked pale, even gray, 
and shaken, as if something she 
held dear had been suddenly taken 
from her. Silently she handed 
around her familiar single sheets 
and stood stiffly, eyes shut. 

It was fourteen forty-one hours in 
Yalta when Demchenko’s beeper 
sounded. He put down his teacup, 
rose stiffly and went to the Heroic 
Worker’s Hotel communications 



COX’S QUALITY 



63 




room to put through a videocall to 
Tehran. 

It was an hour earlier at Juan les 
Pins when Holdeman heard his 
beeper. He was lying next to the 
pool, testing his flesh for doneness 
by seeing how long the white spot 
remained after poking. He got to 
his feet, slipped into a robe and 
went to his hotel room and its 
videophone. He punched uncart’s 
number in Tehran. 

It was roughly a quarter to seven 
in the morning at Acapulco when 
Castenero was awakened by his 
secretary beating on the door. 

"Mr. Castenero, Mr. Caste- 
nero,” she called. ‘‘Are you 
awake?" 

He awoke slowly and took in 
what was happening. He had been 
waked up, as had they all, many 
times on company business. 

“What is it?” he said to the 
closed door. 

“Headquarters on the phone, 
Mr. Peng.” 

He grunted. I thought he wasn't 
going to bother us, he mused. But 
then he flipped the switch on his 
videophone, put on a robe, slicked 
down his hair with his palms and 
waited for the screen to come alive. 

In Hawaii, it was two minutes to 
live when Togo’s call box sounded. 
He was insanely awake, sitting 
erect in a Hash with his feet on the 
floor. He reacted like a fireman 
hearing the bell. Next to him his 
wife groaned and turned over. 

"Yes?” he said into the caller. 



"Call from Tehran, sir,” a voice 
said. “You can take it on your bed- 
side set.” 

"No,” he said, thinking of his 
wife. “Put it through to the set in 
my lounge, if you please.” 

One by one they checked in and 
the four in Tehran watched the 
conference call screen as one 
quarter after another lit up with a 
distant face. The four vacationers 
on the other end could see, covering 
half the screen, their fellow Direc- 
tors in Peng’s office, grouped 
around him like a quartet publicity 
photo. A little to one side Gold sat 
solemnly. 

H m. Castenero thought, she 
doesn't look so hot. 

The other half of the screen con- 
tained the faces of the three other 
missing Directors. Castenero saw 
Togo, Demchenko and Holdeman. 
Holdeman saw Demchenko, Togo 
and Castenero. And so forth. They 
looked curious, expectant, but not 
alarmed. At other times and in 
other places, the world’s leaders so 
assembled could have waited only 
with the greatest dread to learn that 
war, or worse, had broken out. 
Now such doom was impossible. 
uncart had planed down most of 
life’s desperate bumps. 

W hen they were electronically 
assembled Peng looked into 
the screen for several seconds, as if 
trying to make out something about 
the others. Are they well? Are they 
enjoying themselves? Are they sur- 



64 



GALAXY 




prised, anxious? None of these? 

“Everyone on scramble,” he 
asked into the screen. 

“Yes, yes, yes, yes,” came back 
the answers like echoes. 

Whenever a Director traveled a 
sec/com man went with him, 
carrying a scrambler that could be 
fitted to any video phone system in 
the world. It allowed the Directors 
complete privacy. 

“We are assembled today,” Peng 
started almost like a ceremony, “or 
rather I have made this conference 
call to inform you of the latest, and 
if I may say unexpected, results 
from our three pilot areas.” 

Lennox Brown hadn’t quite got 
the knack of conference calls yet 
and he wasn’t sure where to look. 
Nervously, he stared through his 
old-fashioned, but real, hornrims 
at Peng and then at the screen and 
then back again. 

“Without further shilly-shallying 
or foot dragging,” Peng went on, “I 
will simply read you the report.” 
As he read they noticed Dr. Gold 
sitting passively, colorlessly, like 
wax, the whole burden on her 
shoulders, sci had failed. 

Shortly after the glowing six- 
week reports were in, psy/husys in 
the three test areas began to notice 
a dramatic slide. Production fell 
off, sickness again shot up, theft 
remained down but the incidence of 
accidents rose dramatically. The 
pilot plants were worse off than 
before. Oddly, too, the plants listed 
a record number of suicides, all 



with no apparent cause. It was as if 
a number of people in these three 
widely separated areas had sudden- 
ly and together decided to stop 
living. So Peng read the dismal 
record. At the end no one had 
much to say. Peng sat with the 
paper on his lap, legs neatly folded. 

“Anything else?” Holdeman 
said, the Mediterranean sun shin- 
ing in the window behind him. 

Dr. Gold slowly straightened in 
her chair. 

“Just that in the last two months 
there hasn’t been a single new 
pregnancy in any of the areas, 
either,” she said listlessly. 

“You mean,” Cajitenero shot out 
in surprise, “people aren’t even — ” 
“Exactly,” Gold said. 

“ — any more?” he concluded. 
“Then what is it?” Demchenko 
asked. “My God, what is it?” 

She brightened a little. The 
chance for discussion, at least, was 
making her feel better. 

“We don’t know for sure. I be- 
lieve I have a theory, though. We 
gave them Thorsen’s entire Quality 
package. Thorsen was an unusual 
man of great intellect. The people 
we imprinted are not. They are 
ordinary, or less.” A touch of the 
old, unchastened, pure Gold began 
to shine through. 

“So they didn’t know how to 
handle this package of qualities we 
gave them. Their brains weren’t, 
aren’t, up to it. When Thorsen be- 
came frustrated he had his mind to 
fall back on. When these people 



COX’S QUALITY 



65 




become likewise they have no inne. 
resource to help. When Thorsen’s 
hospital grew tedious to him, and it 
often did according to his memoirs, 
he could move into a world of his 
imagination — or just plain stick to 
the job because he had self-discip- 
line. Our people don’t have his 
means." 

“In short, they became bored,” 
Peng said. “That’s clear enough. 
We should have expected that.” 

“Yes,” she said, “we should 
have.” 

“I see.” Togo said from the 
screen. “They had no release for 
their frustrations. We have taken 
the natural ones away and the sub- 
ject's were not deep enough to 
supply others of their own.” 

“Yes, 1 see too,” Lennox Brown 
said hesitantly. “They are hope- 
lessly, hopelessly bored with no 
chance for release.” 

“You can’t give people what be- 
longs to someone else,” Abbassi 
said, and this simple, almost 
absurd statement struck them at 
that moment as being very pro- 
found. 

“It isn’t permissible,” he went 
on, “to tamper with things lightly 
and easily as we do. Men should 
not surrender to the arrogance of 
power.” 

After a great pause that was 
almost one of embarrassment, 
Holdeman spoke again. 

“Well, what now?” he said. 
“Obviously the teams aren’t going 
out.” 



“Certainly obvious,” Peng said. 

“We’ll put them back the way 
they were,” Gold said. “We saved 
their original prints in case any- 
thing went wrong. We'll imprint 
them back. At least we can still use 
the imprinter on severe mental 
cases.” 

"And so it ends,” Castenero 
said. 

She nodded. “Yes, the great ex- 
periment. Man could have been so 
happy, oh, so happy. Science,” she 
said, not sci, “should have done 
this for him.” 

One single tear ran slowly down 
from behind the great glass slab of 
her left lens. 

The great experiment had ended 
and the Directors went back to bed, 
or to the pool, or the hotel ve- 
randah. uncart would put it all 
back the way it was, would make it 
all better again. Soon the world 
would again be free of the threat of 
tranquility, safe for tumult and 
turmoil and tension and temper 
and release from strain. It would be 
free for catharsis, big drunks, 
monumental hangovers and sleep- 
ing late, throwing the clock against 
the wall, missing work, dropping 
things that break, hiding in the 
toilet for a smoke, punching out the 
super and hanging tools in your 
pants until you clanked and had to 
walk carefully as you left the shop. 
In short, the world was once again 
condemned to be unreconstructed. 
As usual uncart still went about 
its business. *

WHA T HAS GONE BEFORE 

The astronomical object called 
Cuckoo is plunging toward the 
Galaxy. It is. literally, the biggest 
riddle in the universe: a body with 
the dimensions of a solar system, it 
is both impossibly large and impos- 
sibly light. With ten million times 
the Sun's bulk, it has only about 
ten times the mass. And yet, al- 
though its average density is not 
much more than a high vacuum, it 
somehow has a solid surface . 
and that surface is inhabited. 

Human beings live on Cuckoo, or 
creatures so like human beings that 
it seems impossible they should not 
share a common ancestry with 
Homo Sapiens. [ Yet Cuckoo has 
never been nearer Earth than it is 
now!} Because Cuckoo's surface 
gravity is so tiny, men can fly in its 
thick, deep atmosphere. 

ORG RIDER is a young man 
from a tribe of native wingmen. He 
is taller and slimmer than men who 
have lived their lives in Earth's 
gravity, but he is clearly human. He 
has set out to find an org's egg, 
hoping to hatch from it one of the 
great tameable flying creatures to 
use for a mount. 

THE WATCHERS are among 
them, beetle-like creatures who are 
the overlords of his homeland, who 
rule by fear and violence, who 
make men their slaves. 

REDLAW, a giant even by Org 
Rider's standards, and thickly 
muscled as well, is one of these 
slaves: but he escapes from them 
and joins Org Rider. 

The boy also encounters a tatter- 
ed. hunger-crazed man. one who is 
strangely squat and thick to Org 



Rider's eyes: and, although they 
cannot communicate well, the boy 
begins to understand that the stran- 
ger is from outside his own world 
entirely. 

BEN PERTIN is the stranger’s 
name, and he is one of a dozen or 
more identical copies of himself. 
Because the distances between stars 
are so great spaceships cannot 
travel between them in a human 
lifetime. Instead, a man who wishes 
to go from the Earth to. say, the 
planet of a G-type star near the 
Pleiades steps into a transmission 
chamber. Every atom of his body is 
marked and charted. A blueprint 
of his body is transmitted to the 
other planet. He himself steps out 
of the chamber unchanged — but 
from the blueprint an exact copy is 
created on the other planet. It is 
not radio that transmits these 
messages. Radio is too slow; the 
blueprints are carried on the 
charges of those strange, faster- 
than-light particles called “ tach - 
yons". Ben Pertin was born on 
Earth. One copy of him — call it the 
“ original ”, — still lives there. An- 
other Ben Pertin was transmited to 
the artificial planet called Sun One, 
the headquarters of the galactic 
federation of intelligent races. From 
Sun One still other duplicates of 
himself have been transmitted to 
the orbiting satellite that circles 
Cuckoo, and from it in turn still 
others have been transmitted to the 
surface of Cuckoo. Most of these 
have died; most of the survivors 
know that death is inevitable. The 
stranger is one such. 

While on Sun One Ben Pertin 
met and married a girl named 



68 




ZARA DOY, also a "copy" of a 
human still living on Earth. 

Now the original Zara has been 
asked to volunteer once again for 
du plication, to be sent directly 
from Earth to the surface of Cuckoo 
for exploration. She agrees — and 
invites her husband, a man Ben 

VII 

O rg rider’s knife was at the 
stranger’s throat before he 
could check himself. The man 
seemed both desperate and star- 
tled. He brought up his arm, less in 
a gesture of defense than as violent 
reflex. He was strong and his swing 
brushed Org Rider’s hand and 
knife away, but threw the stranger 
off balance. He lurched against the 
rock wall behind the waterfall — 
his head met rock and he slumped 
to the ground, stunned. 

Org Rider dropped to his knees 
and embraced the egg fearfully. Its 
bright curve showed no damage. 
He pressed an ear against its warm, 
pliant shell and heard the even, 
faint throb of the young org’s 
heart — along with a random skit- 
tering that meant the creature was 
close to hatching. 

Then Org Rider turned to the in- 
truder. 

The crawling sensation at his 
back was still there. There was no 
doubt of it, the man who lay before 
him was the man the watchers had 
killed. Yet here he was — alive. Cut, 
scratched and battered — all those 
things. But he was not dead. 



Pertin has never met and knows 
nothing of, to come with her. 

And so the two newcomers from 
Earth come to Cuckoo. They know 
that it will be strange and danger- 
ous. They do not know that among 
its dangers is a dying man who 
thinks he is married to Zara. 

Org Rider studied him carefully. 
The stranger’s clothing was not 
quite the same as before. The 
colors were different and the puff- 
sleeved tunic he wore was torn and 
filthy. The bright, metallic objects 
on his arms also seemed different, 
but they seemed the same kind of 
things as those he had worn before. 

No doubt about it — this was the 
same man! 

It dawned on Org Rider that this 
man was the figure he had seen 
falling from the slamming machine. 
Perhaps in that lay some sort of ex- 
planation. Perhaps the machine 
laid eggs that hatched into identical 
creatures like this one. He had 
never heard of such a thing, but he 
had never heard of a dead man’s 
living again, either. 

Remembering that the man in 
his previous life had spoken a few 
intelligible words, Org Rider asked 
carefully, “Are you hungry? Do you 
desire food?” 

The man opened his eyes warily. 
There was no comprehension in 
them. He stroked the metallic 
clutter on his wrist with his other 
hand as though the effort were too 
much for him, and motioned Org 
Rider to speak again. 



69 




“Are you hungry?” Org Rider • 
repeated. “I have some food.” 

The stranger shook his head, but 
his eyes fell on the pouch of food 
Org Rider had dropped. He 
stretched his hand toward it. 

“You are hungry, then,” said 
Org Rider. Quickly he cut a slice of 
flesh from a watersnake and tried 
it. The taste was sweetish and good. 
He put a thin strip of it against the 
stranger’s bearded lips. The man 
whimpered and sucked at it eagerly. 

“It will be better cooked,” Org 
Rider said and offered some of the 
tender purple stalks. The stranger 
chewed at them while Org Rider 
whittled a drill, twirled it to light a 
fire and set some of the snake meat 
to roast. Before long the fragrance 
of roasting meat became as tanta- 
lizing to Org Rider as to his guest — 
they shared the first half-cooked 
strips contentedly while the rest 
continued to brown. 

Then Org Rider forgot the 
stranger, because the egg made 
a sound like ripping cloth. 

I N the nest, the egg was rocking 
from the thrusts of some irtternal 
eruption. A dark split opened and 
spread. Org Rider squatted next to 
the nest, watching in fascination, 
urgently wanting to help but not 
knowing how. Inside the egg dull 
thumping sounds accompanied 
thrusts against the thick internal 
membrane. It ripped, and ripped 
again — and finally he could see the 
dark, wet head of the baby org, 



struggling feebly to emerge. 

The stranger limped over to look, 
then shrugged and went to the 
waterfall. He drank thirstily, his 
eyes fixed on Org Rider and the 
hatching egg. 

The org’s head burst through the 
slit, slick and black. Almost at once 
it began to dry, changing to a pale, 
tawny color. The huge eyes opened, 
the pupils wide and black and my- 
sterious, rimmed with luminous 
blue. It fixed its gaze at once on 
Org Rider. 

Fascinated, Org Rider stared 
back. The baby org seemed to be 
resting and he thought he saw a 
plea in its gaze. For what? He could 
not guess until he saw that the in- 
fant was laboring for breath. He 
seized the edge of the glistening 
membrane and used his knife to 
widen the opening. 

The great head reached out. The 
hatchling gave a strangled, mewing 
cry and its warm breath, sharply 
scented with the odor of parching 
grain, enveloped Org Rider. He 
leaned forward and wiped from the 
tip of the infant’s emerging trunk a 
thick brown clot. 

He relaxed his attention and 
realized for the first time that, over 
the splash of the waterfall, the 
stranger was shouting at him. The 
man was pointing at the sky. Were 
the org’s parents still hunting their 
offspring? And then Org Rider 
heard a familiar whine. 

It took him a moment to catch 
sight of the mottled ship of the 



70 



GALAXY 




watchers. It was flying low over the 
pool below the waterfall, its sound 
suddenly magnified by the sur- 
rounding black walls to a shout of 
distant thunder. 

And Org Rider realized he had 
been seen. 

He turned in indecision, peering 
back into the cave. Would they 
take the infant org away from him? 
Worse — he remembered the warn- 
ing about the watchman’s eye. He 
had thrown it away. Would they 
punish him? 

The gaunt stranger babbled 
fresh gibberish, pointed again at 
the sky and Org Rider saw that a 
gray fleck had separated from the 
ship. The ship flew on, lifted over 
the rim of the canyon and away. 
The fleck dropped toward the pool 
and in a moment spread great 
wings and circled gently down 
toward the waterfall. 

Org Rider pushed the stranger 
back into the cave and ran to his 
org. It had freed itself of the 
luminous membrane, except for a 
few rags that still clung stickily. Its 
tail unfolded, wet and delicate. Its 
whole body burst out in a rich cloud 
of that parched-grain fragrance. 

It was twice Org Rider’s length, 
now that its full dimensions had 
unfolded, but it was still an infant 
and drained of strength by its 
struggle to be born. Its short trunk 
lifted to sniff him — then it slumped 
to the damp rock floor of the cave. 

The boy began to rub it down 
with his wadded shirt, crooning to 



it a song he had learned from his 
mother. Sleepily the org arched its 
thin body to meet the strokes of his 
hand, and its voice seemed to echo 
the song. 

It was out of the question to leave 
the org and impossible to move it. 
It would be an hour or more before 
it could fly and he could not carry it 
and still manage the tricky rocks 
around the falls. He stared desper- 
ately at the stranger, wondering 
how to get him to help. 

And then beyond the stranger, in 
the arch under the edge of the 
waterfall, appeared another figure. 

It was not a watcher — it was 
human, tall, with a fire-red beard 
and keen green eyes. 

“Redlaw,” Org Rider gasped. 

“Org Rider,” acknowledged the 
giant, grinning through the flowing 
beard. "I see you’ve got your org 
after all.” 

H e reached out a hand. Org 
Rider drew back instinctively, 
fingers leaping toward his knife, 
before he decided the gesture was 
friendly and allowed Redlaw to 
shake hands with him. “I followed 
you here,” Redlaw said. “Saw two 
adult orgs looking more frantic 
than usual and wondered if you 
were what they were worrying 
about. I see you were.” 

Org Rider grinned, then asked, 
“Followed me? But how? I got rid 
of the watchman’s eye — ” 

The giant’s laughter boomed. 
“Clever about it, too, weren’t you? 



THEORG’S EGG 



71 




We located it — inside an org! The 
watchers aren’t going to like it if 
they see you again, so I recommend 
you don’t let them. So you’ll have to 
lose that thing.” His finger shot out 
to point at the compass on Org 
Rider's wrist. 

“But that was my father’s — ” 

“No doubt. But where he got it — 
or someone before him — was the 
watchers. It’s trade goods and they 
can trace you buy it as easily as by a 
watchman’s eye. Made for that 
purpose.” 

“If that’s so — why didn’t your 
friends come down and kill me?” 

“Thank me, boy. I convinced 
them you’d been eaten by that org. 
When it came to explaining how 
one telltale was inside the org and 
the other here, I rose to the oc- 
casion. I told them the second one 
had been excreted. But you’ll have 
to take it off before you leave here. 
Org excrement doesn’t move from 
place to place by itself.” He peered 
wonderingly at the stranger, then at 
the infant org. “What’s all this?” 
he demanded. 

Org Rider said proudly, “That’s 
my org — I think he’s hungry.” Ig- 
noring Redlaw for the moment, he 
ran to slice strips from the water- 
snake remnants and offered them 
to the hatchling. It devoured them, 
great eyes fixed on the boy. Its ex- 
ternals were now nearly dry. Most 
of its body loomed a pale gold, 
shading into white along the tips of 
its tail and its wings. Not yet scaled 
like the adult orgs, it was covered 



with a fine velvet that felt like fur 
but consisted in fact, of fleshy 
protuberances that would turn to 
chitin. 

Org Rider fetched water and 
doled it out to the infant. While he 
was tending his org Redlaw spoke 
to the stranger. Org Rider paid no 
attention until he was called. 

“We’ve got to move on, boy,” 
Redlaw said. “Take off that com- 
pass. Don’t break it — they’ll know 
if you do. Just leave it.” 

“Move on where?” Org Rider 
asked. 

“No choice, boy,” boomed Red- 
law. “This fellow you’ve got here — 
he’s what the watchers are looking 
for. Says his name’s Ben Yale 
Pertin — whatever that means. And 
he’s from outside the sky.” 

“That’s crazy,” Org Rider said 
seriously. “There’s nothing outside 
the sky.” 

Redlaw nodded. “Time was I’d 
have agreed with you, but the 
watchers think otherwise. They 
spotted him coming in. Right now 
they’re not looking for you, but 
him. And if we want to keep him 
alive we’ve got to get him where the 
watchers won’t look.” 

“Where would that be?” Org 
Rider slipped the compass off his 
wrist, stood gazing at it. “They 
know where this is. They must 
know you’re here — ” 

“Not necessarily — but they 
might.” Redlaw was thoughtful. “I 
crawled out through a disposal 
hatch when they weren’t looking. 



72 



GALAXY 




But you’re right about the telltale 
compass. When they miss me they 
might come zeroing in on it. And I 
don’t know, boy. You think the 
three of us might travel fast enough 
to get out of range?” 

“Four of us.” Org Rider turned 
to look at his charge. ‘‘There’s 
Babe,” he said. ‘‘I won’t leave 
him.” 

“Is that his name? Babe?” 

“It is for now. And he’s not ready 
to travel.” 

“You mean he might travel right 
away from you, don’t you?” 

Org Rider grinned. “I’m not tak- 
ing that chance!” 

A silence fell. 

‘‘I don’t know, boy,” Redlaw 
said at last. “One thing is — we 
can’t just stay here. The watchers 
won’t only kill us, boy — they’ll feast 
on us — you, me and your org. 
That’s a pleasure I’d like to deny 
them.” He gestured at the stranger. 
“This other fellow might not be 
lucky enough to be on the menu. 
They’ll want him to talk.” 

“Talk about what?” 

“Where he came from. What 
he’s up to, him and his friends that 
pop up all over.” Redlaw looked ill 
at ease. Suddenly he grinned. “I 
know. We’ll use their own telltale 
to confuse them. I can move fast 
enough by myself — I’ll take it a 
good long way down Knife-in-the- 
Sky and drop it off a cliff some- 
where. Let them hunt it there. They 
won’t have any reason to come back 
here then, and this is as cozy a spot 



as we’ll find.” He was already 
standing, beginning to strap his 
wings on again. “Stay out of sight. 
I’ll be back in a thousand breaths 
or so — if I’m lucky.” 

T he time stretched to more than 
a thousand breaths. It became 
fifteen hundred, then two thou- 
sand. 

Org Rider could have stayed in 
the cave forever, delighted with 
watching his hatchling grow 
stronger with every breath, but the 
growth required food and he had at 
last to steal out from under the 
waterfall and forage. Redlaw had 
left his cleaver. Org Rider took it 
and bounded along the river course 
to the forest, where huge fat golden 
moths trailed gray wakes of sickly 
bittersweet fragrance. He despaired 
of catching one of them without ex- 
posing himself, but the trees them- 
selves were sources of food. He 
leaped to hack off huge seed cones 
with the cleaver, split them open 
and found them full of edible seeds 
as well as wriggling, blind, horned 
grubs, probably those of the moths. 

When he came back to the cave 
behind the waterfall the stranger 
was sleeping again. Org Rider re- 
garded him with suspicion tinged 
with fear. He had not forgotten that 
he had seen this man die once. He 
did not understand how it was he 
was alive again, but something 
about all this made the bristles at 
the back of his neck crawl. 

Still, for the moment, Babe was 



THE ORG’S EGG 



73 




more important. The young org 
was awake and eager. He drained 
the water Org Rider brought him, 
then whimpered and crooned for 
more food. The grubs went into his 
capacious maw so fast that before 
the boy knew it they were gone and 
he and his sleeping guest — or cap- 
tive — were still unfed. No matter. 
The humans could go hungry. A 
newly hatched org had to eat or die. 

The stranger awoke briefly, 
barely long > enough to drink some 
water, look .around for food, find a 
few scraps and return to sleep. Org 
Rider sat with his hatchling, sing- 
ing softly to it as his mother had 
taught him. It pleased him im- 
mensely to see it respond and fall 
asleep, but it woke again to be fed 
and the scraps that were left were 
meager. 

Another thousand breaths later 
Org Rider decided he had to fo[age 
once more. At the waterfall’s edge 
he paused uncertainly, then dived 
for the shelter of the vegetation. 

At once he realized he was in 
danger. The rush of the waterfall 
had drowned the sound that came 
from the sky, the shrieks of the 
angry adult orgs. 

He burrowed under a thick 
cluster of tough gray-green vines, 
inedible and useless to him but not, 
he discovered, to some tiny biting 
creatures that disputed possession 
with him. Hundreds of breaths 
passed before he dared venture out. 

He stood beside the vines, listen- 
ing. The shrieks of the orgs were far 



away again. But now came some- 
thing else — a clattering sound, 
more like the sound of the 
stranger’s slamming machine than 
anything else Org Rider could 
remember hearing. 

A many-jointed object appeared 
over the lip of the canyon and 
dropped toward him. As it hit the 
pebbly fringe of the pool it made a 
clattering racket. It was followed by 
another similar object and then by 
the huge form of Redlaw, dropping 
easily down toward Org Rider. 

Redlaw said, “There are orgs up 
the slope and a watcher ship is 
cruising around. Get this stuff 
inside.” 

“But I’ve got to find food — ” 

“You won’t have a mouth to eat 
it with if we don’t get under cover.” 

Org Rider could not argue with 
that clear wisdom. The many- 
jointed, clattering objects turned 
out to be collections of queer metal 
shapes, held together by vines. Org 
Rider picked up one, Redlaw the 
other, and they managed to get 
them inside the cave. 

Panting from his effort, Redlaw 
said proudly, “I found it — I found 
his slamming machine. Couldn’t 
carry the whole thing — it was 
banged up so bad. But I took all 
the loose pieces and brought them 
here.” 

The stranger propped himself on 
an elbow, staring at the collection 
of bits and pieces. He said some- 
thing in his unintelligible speech 
and creakingly got to his feet. 



74 



GALAXY 




Dried blood was black on his nearly 
naked, half starved body. Org 
Rider felt compassion for him, 
mingled with the dread and the 
anger — actually he had little anger 
left, since Babe had not been 
harmed by the man’s attempt to 
smash the egg and eat it, but there 
was still a vestigial core of dread. 

The man shuffled over in his 
curious stumbling gait and thumb- 
ed through the hardware excitedly. 
He fumbled out a flat black oblong 
with a handle and touched it in 
some way Org Rider did not under- 
stand. It sprang open, revealing 
oddly shaped shining objects that 
looked like tools. With them the 
stranger began to assault the 
bangles he wore on his wrist. Org 
Rider involuntarily stepped back, 
remembering how those bangles on 
the other stranger had seemed to 
speak to him with a voice of their 
own. 

“Go to it," boomed Redlaw 
lustily. “Fix up your gadgets for us. 
That’s what I want you to do.” 

“What is?” Org Rider de- 
manded. 

“Why, I want him to repair those 
trinkets of his. They’re powerful 
things, man! Weapons. Machines. 
I don’t understand them, but I 
know they’re something that’s never 
been seen in the world before — and 
I want them.” 

“For what?” 

“For the big job that’s ahead of 
us. This funny-looking fellow is the 
key to our chance to deal with the 



watchers. Nothing in the flatworld 
has a chance to break their power, 
certainly not your people. Not even 
me, and I know more than anyone 
else. you’ve ever met about weapons 
and how to use them. But this man 
has weapons I mean to have.” 

Org Rider stared at the scare- 
crow figure disbelievingy. “He’s 
only a man,” he said. “Not much of 
a man at that. Our potter was 
bigger than he is and I beat the 
potter in fair fight.” 

“You won’t beat this one, boy. 
He’s stronger than you think.” 
“Stronger than the watchers?” 
“His weapons are. And he’ll give 
them to us, I promise. Or — ” 

“Or what?” 

After a moment Redlaw finished 
his thought somberly. “Or we’ll kill 
him and take the weapons away 
from him,” he said. 

VIII 

W hen they stepped out of the 
tachyon-transport chamber, 
Jon and Zara Gentry were greeted 
by a female creature, human in 
shape, but with great angel wings. 
Her face was remotely, cruelly 
beautiful, but it was not the face of 
a human being and the Gentrys 
knew her for what she was, an 
edited version of some nonhuman 
race of the galaxy that had revised 
its transported copies into a physi- 
cal form more useful in the environ- 
ment of Cuckoo. 

“Welcome to Ground Station 



THE ORG’S EGG 



75 




One,” the creature chimed in a 
voice like sweet bells. “My name is 
Valkyrie. I am pleased to see the 
first representatives of Planet Earth 
arrive on the surface of Cuckoo.” 

Zara looked doubtfully at her 
husband, then reached out a hand, 
which Valkyrie took politely. 
Clearly she had been with human 
beings in some other environment 
before coming to Cuckoo — the 
custom of a handshake did not dis- 
turb her at all. 

Beyond the silver girl floated a 
glittering cloud that changed shape 
like a swarm of diamond bees, so 
tiny that the individual members 
were almost indetectable. Over 
them, partly obscured by their 
dazzle, a creature swam gently in 
the air. It had the wings of a butter- 
fly and the head of a bat. Zara 
Gentry identified both lifeforms 
readily enough. The swarm was a 
collective entity — usually identified 
as Boaty-Bits — from a planet of a 
star in the constellation of Bootes. 
The single creature was a T’Worlie. 

From the T’Worlie came a shrill 
whistle that Zara’s pmal rendered 
into, “I identify you, Zara Doy." 

Zara looked doubtfully at her 
husband, who shrugged. “I am 
Zara Doy,” she said. “Or was. This 
is my husband. According to our 
custom I have taken his name and 
so I am now called Zara Gentry.” 

The T’Worlie did not respond. 
In the languid gravity of Cuckoo it 
did not need to exert itself to fly — it 
was enough for it to ripple its wings 



slowly. From it came a sharp but 
not unpleasant odor suggesting an 
open pickle jar in a warm pantry. 

Neither of the Gentrys had ever 
seen Boaty-Bits or T’Worlies in the 
flesh before — if “flesh” was the 
right word. The two humans had 
no difficulty in recognizing the two 
alien species from stereo-stage pic- 
tures, but nothing in the stereo- 
views had prepared them for the 
sense of whirling power in the 
Boaty-Bits, or the acrid odor of the 
T’Worlie. “My identity,” it rapped 
metallically through the pmal 
translator — how quickly, Zara 
thought, one became accustomed 
to listening to that rather than the 
shrill pipings of the T’Worlie 
itself — “can be described as one 
Nimmie. We did have mutual 
identification on Sun One, but I 
now perceive you are a different 
version.” 

“And I knew you too,” sang the 
silver girl sweetly. “Will you look 
around your new home?” 

It was a confusing new home. Its 
plan was hard to make out, but 
Zara Gentry had seen stereo-stage 
images of it — spherical shells blown 
out of some transparent golden- 
hued material, linked together and 
outfitted to meet the needs of its in- 
habitants. Some of those needs 
were bizarre, she knew. Parts of the 
complex were out of bounds to air- 
breathing mammals — places where 
the methane creatures lived, or 
those whose natural waste products 
were violently poisonous to humans. 



76 



GALAXY 




The largest of the bubbles was 
elevated above the others and from 
it Zara and her husband could look 
out to see a distant flat plain 
rimmed by mountains. They were 
themselves on a mountain, for she 
could see, just outside the bubble, 
rocky slopes that fell away end- 
lessly. Turning to look out the other 
side, she saw a shelf of woodland 
and the rest of the mountain rising 
incredibly toward the sky. Its top 
was not in sight. 

The inhabitants were as strange 
as the home. There was a curious 
thing like a single enormous blue 
eye that moved about without wings 
or legs, by the manipulation of elec- 
trostatic forces. When it moved it 
sounded like fine gravel thrown on 
a tin roof and the discharge pro- 
duced a tingle of ozone. The 
creature was Sirian, Jon whispered. 
Beyond it he pointed out a thing 
like a rippling blob of baker’s 
dough that he called a Sheliak. As 
Zara and he approached the shape- 
less bun it protruded a stalk that 
formed lips and made a sound their 
translators rendered as: “It gives 
joy to encounter you once more.” 

Zara found it disconcerting to be 
recognized by creatures she had 
never seen. Flushing faintly, she 
repeated her apologies for being a 
different version; apparently nearly 
all the beings here were direct 
copies from individuals on the arti- 
ficial planetoid called Sun One, 
where all the races of the galaxy 
had representatives to mediate and 



interpret their differing interests 
and goals. 

After so long a voyage — tens of 
thousands of light-years — Zara felt 
she should rest and freshen up. But 
of course tachyon transport was not 
tiring. The patterns of their bodies, 
carried by faster-than-light tach- 
yons, had not really moved any- 
where. When they were in transit 
they were only concepts, so to 
speak — they were patterns, and 
had no more sensation or thought 
than a schematic diagram. Never- 
theless she was fatigued. It was cul- 
ture shock, she thought — the im- 
pact of so much change in so short 
a time. She pleaded fatigue in any 
case and without demurrer — no 
two races of the Galaxy really 
understood each other’s foibles — 
Val showed them their own quar- 
ters. 

W hen Zara awoke to her first 
“day” on Cuckoo she incau- 
tiously got out of bed as though she 
were still on Earth. Even edited, 
her muscles were disproportionate 
to Cuckoo’s needs. She flew off the 
airbed as though it had exploded, 
catching her balance at the very last 
second necessary to keep from 
crashing into the wall. 

The noise aroused her husband. 
He opened his eyes and said, “I 
dreamed were were on Cuckoo.” 
He looked around and added: “I 
never had a dream turn out to be 
true before.” 

Zara was listening only politely. 



THE ORG’S EGG

She had gone at once to their stereo 
stage to refresh her memory of the 
place to which they had exiled 
themselves for the rest of their lives. 

Cuckoo was an enormous ball 
that hung in empty space, forty 
thousand light-years outside the 
fringing arms of the galaxy. 

It had been a puzzle for all the 
galaxy’s scientists since the cruising 
robot scoutships of the T’Worlie 
had first detected it. It was a per- 
fect monad of polar opposites — 
huge and hard-crusted, yet with an 
average density not much above 
that of a total vacuum. Alone in 
space in the hard emptiness be- 
tween galaxies, heading toward the 
Milky Way at a velocity that was a 
substantial fraction of c. 

There was no such thing as day 
or night on the surface of Cuckoo. 
There was no external object bright 
enough to shed light on it. What 
light there was came from bright 
phosphorescing clouxis that hung in 
its thick air. 

It was as big as a solar system, 
nearly two A. U. in diameter. Did it 
rotate? Yes, in a manner of speak- 
ing — the question was confusing, 
coming down to rotation relative to 
what? Relative to the nearest 
globular cluster of the Milky Way, 
Cuckoo turned on its axis once 
every eight hundred-odd Earth 
days. To natives of Cuckoo the ro- 
tation would have been difficult to 
understand and of no importance 
at all; there was never anything to 
see from the flatlands where they 



lived, and even from the high 
mountains it was only occasionally 
that one might catch a glimpse of 
the Milky Way. It would take many 
generations to realize that that 
tipped spiral puddle of light rose on 
one horizon and, over the course of 
an Earthly year and more, slowly 
climbed to its zenith and disap- 
peared below the western sky. The 
Milky Way was not the only thing 
that could be seen in the sky — M-31 
in Andromeda was quite visible 
with a little luck, as were the 
Magellanic Clouds. But the Milky 
Way was by far the biggest and 
brightest, occupying nearly half the 
sky when fully risen. 

None of these were of any use in 
telling time. Ground Station One 
was on galactic arbitrary standard 
time, a metrication that cycled at 
some thirty Earth hours. Zara 
found out quickly that it was close 
enough to a terrestrial day to be 
recognizable, different enough to 
be disconcerting. It made her first 
“day” unusually long. 

Even so, there was hardly time 
enough to do all she and Gentry 
had to do. The briefings on Earth 
had been intriguing and even 
proved useful — but here in the face 
of the massive reality of Cuckoo, 
swelling all around them, both 
Gentrys had everything to learn. 
The process was exhausting. They 
spent hours just in learning to deal 
with the flimsy gravity of Cuckoo. 
Even in their down-muscled edited 
forms, every step sent them flying 



78 



GALAXY 




at first. (“I know you’ve been trying 
to lose a few pounds — ” Jon 
grinned — “but this is ridiculous.”) 
They had to learn to deal with the 
representatives of the nine other 
races in Ground Station One. 
T’Worlies, Sheliaks, Arcturans and 
all, each had their own purposes 
and needs and all had as much 
right to be represented here as had 
Earth humans. More, thought Zara 
fairly — the galactic culture ex- 
change had been going for thou- 
sands of years before humanity had 
become aware of it. 

And above al she and Jon had to 
learn what was on Cuckoo itself. 

There existed, in the central 
workroom, a three-dimensional 
stereo stage program which, on 
command, conjured up a slowly 
spinning image of the body itself. 
Much of it was blank even yet. The 
tachyar mapping, scanning the sur- 
face of Cuckoo from the orbiting 
space station, had not completed 
even one full revolution and some 
ninety per cent of the surface of 
Cuckoo had been mapped only at 
extremely long range or not at all. 
This was not at first evident. The 
basic sphere was wholly featureless 
to the naked eye, except for some 
blurry discolorations. The program 
could on command magnify any 
desired portion of the surface. 
Where the scan was complete, such 
portions showed seas, mountain 
ranges, forests, deserts — a thou- 
sand different kinds of locale. The 
one little area they were now ex- 



ploring, Zara saw with dismay, was 
only an insignificant point on the 
globe — yet it stretched half the 
diameter of Europe. There was 
simply too much to map. Less de- 
tail showed on their globe than the 
maps of the Elizabethan admirals 
had showed of the interior of 
Africa. 

Valkyrie was a patient teacher 
and an even-tempered friend. Zara 
found herself relating to the silvery 
creature as though she were a 
human girl. It was a shock to her to 
remind herself that this shape was 
probably nothing like Val’s real 
body in whatever hellishly inhos- 
pitable environment she had lived 
on her home world. It had been 
edited into a more viable form, but 
Zara knew very well that the shape 
they saw was not “Valkyrie’s” own. 

Fortunately for mankind, most 
of the races of the galaxy were close 
enough to oxygen-breathing, water- 
based mammals that the consen- 
sual common environment — races 
met usually in an atmosphere 
human beings could endure. Even 
races like the Arcturans and the 
Sheliaks could tolerate it. That it 
was not what they were used to did 
not matter, since one was robot and 
the other so protean that it could 
survive anywhere. Two alternatives 
existed for races to whom oxygen 
and water were poison. They could 
borrow the bodies of oxygen-toler- 
ating species — humans were very 
popular for this — by inserting tach- 
yon-coupled transponders into their 



THE ORG’S EGG 



79 




brains. The bodies were then 
wholly controlled by the creatures 
who had taken them over. Zara had 
seen enough of such men and 
women, usually incurable criminals 
called “Purchased People.” They 
were common enough on Earth. 
The other alternative was to edit 
the “pattern” transported by the 
tachyons into some form that could 
stand air, water and the tempera- 
ture limits of the consensual en- 
vironment. Val’s people had chosen 
that way to go. 

To be sure, editing was not un- 
common for all races. Zara and Jon 
themselves were edited. Their phy- 
sical strength was an actual handi- 
cap on Cuckoo, so their new bodies 
were altered in the physics and 
chemistry of the musculature to a 
sort of compromise between what 
was appropriate to Earth, and what 
was desirable on Cuckoo, where 
each of them weighed only a few 
pounds. At the same time their pro- 
portions had been altered, making 
them taller and thinner and thus 
less strange to the natives of 
Cuckoo. 

T hey were impatient to start to 
explore the surface of Cuckoo — 
it was what they were there for. Val 
apologized in that voice like the 
tinkling of bells. Their equipment 
was not yet -ready; their flying-belts 
had to be made to measure and 
their new measurements had not 
been available. They would come 
soon, she promised. Meanwhile. 



Jon halted her. “What I don’t 
know,” he said, “is what happened 
to the other parties that have gone 
out. I understand they didn’t come 
back. I don’t know why.” 

“They all died,” chimed Val 
sweetly. 

Zara said, conscious of an unease 
in her body, “Well, we know that 
much. We don’t know what hap- 
pened, though.” Something she 
could not quite analyze was work- 
ing inside her — a feeling that she 
should be more terrified. It was 
death they were talking about — and 
an opposite, intellectual under- 
standing told her that this life was 
only an appendage to her “real” 
life back on Earth and her death 
here would be only an episode that 
she ‘‘really” might not even ever 
know. The concept was funda- 
mentally disturbing, a thought she 
could not quite deal with and could 
not wholly suppress. 

But Val was answering their 
questions. “We have dispatched 
eight individuals to the surface 
directly from the orbiter, prior to 
the establishment of this station,” 
she chimed. “All eight have ter- 
minated contact with the orbiter. 
Five are known to be dead. The 
other three are probably also dead. 
Six were humans and two were 
Sheliaks. Actually — ” she corrected 
herself — “one was a human being 
and one a Sheliak, replicated re- 
spectively six and two times.” 

“Persistent human being,” com- 
mented Jon. “What killed him?” 



80 



GALAXY 




“It is not known in all cases,” 
said Val brightly. “Please come.” 
She spread her great silvery wings 
and arrowed out of the smaller 
chamber into the great central 
bubble. A Sirian eye was hovering 
just before a stereo stage, patiently 
studying the scene it portrayed. It 
did not look around as they came 
in, but there was a strong sting of 
ozone in the air. Jon and Zara saw 
that there was a whole bank of 
stages beneath the transparent belt 
that gave them their view out onto 
the surface of Cuckoo, each with a 
different scene. Val touched the 
controls of an unused stage and it 
tilled with a shining silver mist that 
swirled and hardened into an image 
of a mountain peak. 

“This is the top of the mountain 
we are on,” Val explained. “Ob- 
serve the bare rocks. Look closely.” 
She waved and the peak shot nearer 
so that they could see details. 
Something that glowed with a faint, 
unpleasant bluish sheen was cling- 
ing to the rock. “That slime,” she 
said, “appears to be a part of a 
growth process in the mountain. It 
is violently corrosive — whether 
through chemical or radioactive re- 
actions we are not sure. The second 
Sheliak came in contact with it and 
literally rotted to death while still in 
communication.” 

Zara shuddered. Jon said, “It 
sounds unpleasant.” It was obvious 
that Zara agreed. 

Val turned her harshly beautiful 
stare on him. “It is probably quite 



undesirable for organic creatures,” 
she agreed. “As you know, Sheliaks 
do not experience pain in the same 
way as most sentients. This one was 
able to describe what was happen- 
ing until its central nervous system 
failed entirely. It was not attrac- 
tive,” she finished thoughtfully. 
Zara wonderingly thought that, 
whatever the metallic form Val 
wore as a convenience, in her native 
state she might well be as frail and 
delicate as a human. 

“There may have been other 
deaths due to the slime,” Val went 
on. “The three of which we have 
certain knowledge, however — the 
other Sheliak and two of the men: — 
were due to flying creatures.” She 
manipulated the controls and dis- 
played an org. “Also,” she said, 
“there are intelligent machine- 
using creatures here of whom little 
is known. They may be involved. 
And, of course, there are analogues 
of many galactic races. There is no 
shortage of dangers on Cuckoo. We 
simply do not yet know what they 
all are.” 

Zara Gentry turned slowly, 
studying the bank of stages. The 
ones in use were panning slowly 
across a vista of woods, plains and 
lakes. These were only monitors, 
through which the sentients present 
in Ground Station One could see 
what was being transmitted to the 
orbiter and on by tachyon trans- 
mission to receivers throughout the 
galaxy. As they watched, one of the 
stages emitted a harsh electronic 



THEORG’S EGG 



81 




squeal for attention. It stopped 
panning and locked onto something 
large and winged. 

“Found something,” Val chim- 
ed. “That is one of the flying crea- 
tures. The stage is programed to 
follow it for a period of time, in 
case we wish to study it. If not, it 
will resume scanning shortly. And 
over there — ” she pointed to the 
stage in front of the Sirian eye — “is 
what is perhaps the most severe real 
danger.” 

What the stage revealed was an 
actual vehicle. Zara said, “Machine 
users. The beings you mentioned?” 

“Yes,” agreed the silvery girl. 
“These creatures have no analogue 
in the galaxy. They are apparently 
evolved autochthons and may be 
eligible for participation in the ga- 
lactic councils. But much of the 
other life is not native.” 

She touched the controls again 
and displayed a tree that seemed to 
be emitting a sort of shimmering 
fog. 

Zara looked closer and gasped in 
surprise. ‘‘Are they bees? No, 
wait — I think they’re Boaty-Bits!” 

“Yes,” chimed Val. “Bootians. 
And here is a recording of She- 
liaks.” She displayed another 
image, then another and another. 
“Antareans. Canopan semi-lizards. 
Some of these are not to be found in 
this vicinity, but do exist in other 
areas of the surface of Cuckoo. Al- 
together twelve of the sentient races 
of the galaxy have been logged on 
Cuckoo, including — ” 



She touched the controls again, 
and showed the figure of a tall, 
spare woman in a breechclout, 
grinding grain. 

“Human beings?” cried Zara 
Gentry. “How did they get here?” 

“How did any of them get here?” 
chimed the silvery girl. “To find 
out how that happened is our 
primary mission. It is definitely es- 
tablished that, however it happen- 
ed, it was a long time ago — there 
have been marked evolutionary 
changes. You can see some physical 
differences in your own race, no 
doubt. And some of the species — 
Canopans and Antareans in par- 
ticular — have regressed to nonsen - 
tient forms, or at least to non- 
culture forms. The Bootians may 
retain hive intelligence. We’re not 
sure because we have not been able 
to communicate and, as you know, 
they do not under normal circum- 
stances employ artifacts. The only 
ones we are sure are nonregressed 
are your own race and a small 
colony of Sheliaks, very far from 
here.” 

“It’s crazy,” said Jon Gentry. 

The silvery girl laughed — a sound 
like sleighbells. “Of course. Isn’t 
that why the object has its name? It 
was one of your own people, I 
think, who originally called it 
Cuckoo.” 

T heir tailored flying equipment 
arrived, designed and built on 
Sun One and transmitted via 
tachyon. The Gentrys strapped it 



82 



GALAXY 




on awkwardly. None of the other 
sentients in Ground Station One 
could be of much help. Val had no 
need of the flying suits, having her 
wings. The Sirian eye, the Arcturan 
robot and the T’Worlie also had 
their own transport and, in any 
case, the anatomies were so differ- 
ent that the Sirian, for instance, 
simply could not understand the 
concept of a belt. 

The first items the Gentrys put 
on were wings. Zara stroked them 
doubtfully; they were ridiculously 
tiny, proportionately smaller than 
the membranes that supported a 
flying squirrel. “They are only for 
directional control,” chimed Val. 
“And perhaps for a gentle landing, 
if for any reason your drive should 
fail.” 

Zara was still doubtful. But her 
husband seemed to accept the 
equipment. The drive unit was 
strapped to their backs. It was a 
simple athodyd pulse-jet. It was de- 
signed to require only water as 
“fuel” — not really fuel, but a work- 
ing medium that would have to be 
replaced as it was discharged. The 
actual energy source was a compact 
star of radioisotopes, which re- 
leased heat on command. The heat 
flash-boiled the water. The explod- 
ing gas for the jet was only steam. 
The water was carried in two 
kidney-shaped flasks of soft plastic 
strapped around the waist. 

“They look very small,” said 
Zara doubtfully. 

“The first exploring parties had 



larger drive equipment,” chimed 
Val. “Some had actual vessels — the 
beings rode inside. To be so en- 
closed did not keep them alive.” 

Jon glanced at his wife and said 
quickly, “Let’s try out these rigs.” 

The equipment worked beauti- 
fully. The hammering sound of the 
jet was unpleasantly close to the 
base of their skulls, but as the 
novices gained speed the sound 
dwindled behind them. 

They returned to the bubble- 
complex almost regretfully. To be 
able to swoop and circle around the 
thick air of Cuckoo had been a 
joyous experience for the Gentrys. 

The rest of their equipment was 
simple enough. Personal necessi- 
ties: soap, toothbrushes, toilet 
paper, changes of clothing. Food 
supplies consisted of iron rations, 
heavy on protein and vitamins but 
by no means tempting to the palate 
or calculated to satisfy a large 
appetite. “I’m not too crazy about 
living on that stuff for a week,” Jon 
grunted. 

“You need not,” sang Val. “You 
eaters can subsist off the native 
flora and fauna well enough. You 
have already eaten meals prepared 
from it.” 

“That steak last night?” asked 
Zara. 

“Yes. And the salad. And the 
beverage. I myself need only energy 
and I get that from the power- 
packs. But I understand that as 
much of the biota here is edible as 
on your own planet.” 



THE ORG’S EGG

One item gave Zara pause. With 
some dismay she hefted a gun that 
had been custom built for her 
hand. 

“The lower trigger is a projec- 
tile,” said Valkyrie. “The upper, a 
laser beam. Lower for food, upper 
to kill instantly.” 

“What about you?” Jon de- 
manded. 

Valkyrie tolled somberly, “1 have 
built-in weapons, Jon Gentry. We 
may all need armament to defend 
ourselves.” She hung in the air, 
slowly fanning her wings, regarding 
them from bright, silver eyes. “You 
will need to sleep again,” she said. 
“And when you wake we will 
begin.” 

Zara’s breath caught in her 
throat. “So soon?” 

“So soon,” echoed Val. 

W hen her husband was already 
in bed, face turned away 
from the light, and the gentle 
sounds of his breathing were be- 
coming deeper with sleep, Zara 
Gentry lingered in front of the tiny 
mirror, stroking her face with- 
cream. She was not looking at her- 
self — she was staring emptily and 
had forgotten what she was doing. 

What had made her forget was 
something she had remembered — 
that light-years away another Zara 
Gentry was, at that very hour 
making her way through the 
crowded flyways of New York to- 
ward the stereo stage studios for 
her regular nightly appearance. 



What would she be talking about, 
this other Zara? Her emotions 
when she volunteered for tachyon 
transport to Cuckoo? Her immense 
relief when she stepped out of the 
chamber and found she was still on 
Earth? 

Zara absently wiped the cream 
from her face and rested her chin 
on her hands, framing the sen- 
tences in her mind that that other 
Zara Gentry would be using to open 
the broadcast: Well, friends. I 
walked out of the chamber and 
back to Earth (cut to longshot of 
the tachyon-transport building, pan 
of the chamber itself with Zara 
coming out of it) and it was queer. 
Queasy. I don't know how to 
describe it. I knew that here I was. 
And yet at the same time I was 
somewhere else — out on the surface 
of Cuckoo, so far away that / can't 
see it with the biggest telescope on 
Earth. 1 was entering a whole new 
existence . 

She caught herself reaching for 
the stereo-stage recorder to make a 
note of the opening for her next 
broadcast. 

There would be no need for that. 
Not here, not ever here. Whatever 
else happened, this Zara Gentry 
was forever doomed to stay on 
Cuckoo. Oh, perhaps she could 
physically be carried to the orbiting 
station in a rocket if she swung 
sufficient weight. But that was 
most unlikely — and that she would 
ever leave in any other way was im- 
possible. 



84 



GALAXY 




But after a moment she did reach 
for the stereo-stage recorder and 
said into it, “For transmission to 
Zara Doy Gentry on Earth. Zara, 
dear — dear me, I don’t know how 
to address myself! But I am here 
and well. Jon is also well and in a 
few hours we are going to begin to 
explore the surface of Cuckoo. In 
my edited form I am tall and thin, 
just as I always wanted to be. And, 
dear distant self, I can tell you one 
other thing about me — I am afraid. 
Not panicky. Not crippled by 
terror. But scared.” 

Scared or not, she went on to give 
a bright, entertaining ten-minute 
account of what had happened 
since her arrival on Cuckoo. 

It was the least a girl could do for 
herself, she reflected, settling gently 
into her bed. And it was oddly com- 
forting to know that she would in 
fact be on the stereo-stage world- 
wide one more time — herself, not 
just that other Zara Gentry. As she 
drifted toward sleep she thought 
that a girl in her position could use 
all the comfort she could get. 



A hundred and twenty degrees of 
i arc around the circumference 
of Cuckoo swung the orbiter called 
Cuckoo Station. It was a strange- 
looking thing, about the size of a 
three-story house in its main di- 
mensions, with extensions that shot 
spindly towers a half-mile into space 
and trailed filmy sheets oflaminated 
metal and plastic for more than 



three miles around it. It did not look 
as though it could survive the 
faintest summer breeze. This was 
correct. It could not. It never 
needed to, for Cuckoo Station had 
never known an atmosphere around 
it. It had been created in orbit out of 
the tachyon transport cell dropped 
by the doomship that had brought 
the galaxy’s eyes and ears to Cuckoo 
and had then gone on with its dead 
or dying crew. 

The sentients who inhabited 
Cuckoo Station w'ere quite similar 
to those on Ground Station One. 
This was not surprising. Most of 
those on Ground Station One 
were duplicated copies from the 
orbiter itself. One individual who 
was not duplicated in the station on 
the surface of Cuckoo was the 
human being named Ben Line 
Pertin. Partly this was because he 
had already been duplicated times 
enough on the surface of Cuckoo — 
he had watched himself die three 
ways so far and suspected three 
others. Partly it was because, for 
the past few galactic consensual 
days, he had reported himself sick. 

He had felt sick. Sick and de- 
spairing. When he reported himself 
back for duty it was not because he 
really wanted to get back to his 
work on the orbiter — it was only be- 
cause it, or anything, was better 
than lying in his cocoon and watch- 
ing stale repeated dramas on the 
stereo stage. He relieved his pre- 
decessor on the monitoring detail, a 
T’Worlie named Nlem and, suck- 



THE ORG’S EGG

ing a bubble of coffee to wake 
himself up, began to reel disin- 
terestedly through the transmis- 
sions of the last few days to see if 
anything had happened. 

Something had. 

Pertin sat up so abruptly that his 
motion jerked the bulb of coffee out 
of his hand. Tfling, the Arcturan 
eye who was conducting some in- 
comprehensible research of its own 
in the monitor chamber, emitted a 
staccato ripping sound of electrical 
energy as it flung itself desperately 
away from the sprinkling drops of 
liquid. 

Pertin’s pmal rang with the 
harsh, angry accusation: “Danger! 
Water deleterious. Destructive. 
Hostile action perceived!” 

“Sorry, sorry — ” Pertin tried to 
backtrack the stereo image and at 
the same time activate the emer- 
gency air-purification systems. He 
managed, but not with further 
anger from the Arcturan — reason- 
able enough, Pertin knew, but he 
was not in a mood to be reasonable. 

As soon as possible, he spun 
back to the beginning of the mes- 
sage he had sampled. It had been 
aimed at Earth and, of course, 
intercepted routinely by the orbiter 
for information purposes. It was a 
personal message and the face of 
the girl sending it was what had 
startled him. 

It was Zara. 

He listened to the whole message, 
then turned off the stereo stage, 
sick again and dazed. 



Zara Gentry? 

And here on Cuckoo — only light- 
minutes away — but with Jon Gen- 
try. Her husband. 

Automatically his hand reached 
out for the transmission switch. He 
keyed it to the ground station and 
croaked, “Orbiter calling, personal 
communication, please respond.” 
The station was on its toes — or 
on whatever passed for toes in a 
T’Worlie. The creature who re- 
sponded almost instantly stared out 
at Ben Line Pertin and said 
through its pmal translator, 
“Greeting, Ben Line. I have joy 
that you are well again.” 

“Thanks, NIem,” said Pertin. 
“I want to — ” 

“It is now Nloom,” said the 
T’Worlie. “NIem is the version still 
aboard the orbiter with you. Nleem 
is the other version transported 
here.” 

“Nloom, then, damnit! Please. I 
have to get a message through right 
away.” 

“For whom is your message?” 
“For my w — ” Ben Line stopped 
and swallowed. “For Mrs. Zara 
Doy Gentry,” he croaked. “May I 
please speak to her at once?” 

The T’Worlie, who ha dknown 
Ben Line well enough in their time 
together on the orbiter, stared at 
him thoughtfully out of its enor- 
mous eyes. Finally the pmal chirp- 
ed, “It was my conjecture you 
would have a message for her.” 
"Sure I would. Can I speak to 
her?” 



86 



GALAXY 




“Negative. She has left with a 
survey expedition. Their circuits 
are fully occupied with telemetry 
and necessary administrative com- 
munications at this time. There 
will, however, be a direct channel 
opening in — ” the T’Worlie spun 
in air to look at something out of 
Ben Line’s field of view, then spun 
back to look at him — “in about two 
and one-half consensual hours. I 
can then relay a message if you 
wish.” 

“I’d rather talk to her direct, 
Nloom,” Pertin pleaded. “Can you 
patch me through?” 

“Affirmative,” chirped the T’- 
Worlie, “although that is, of 
course, contingent on Zara Doy 
Gentry’s desire to use available 
time for that purpose.” It hung 
there silently for a moment, then 
added: “Friend Ben Line, it is a 
different version here. She does not 
know you, I think. What shall I tell 
her of your desire to speak with 
her?” 

Ben Line hesitated. 

Of course the T’Worlie was 
right. This Zara had come directly 
from Earth. If she had heard of his 
existence at all it would have been 
only casually: someone her Sun 
One duplicate had met there and 
married. She did not know him; 
worse, she herself was married to 
another man. 

What could he say to her? 

To that question he had no 
answer at all. 

“I don’t know, Nloom," he said 



dismally. “I guess — I think you’d 
better forget I called. I have to 
think this over.” 

He flipped the switch that dis- 
solved the compassionate stare of 
the T’Worlie into a silvery mist as 
the stereo stage went blank. He sat 
there, staring into the empty tank 
of the stage, seeing nothing, feeling 
nothing but a wretched, suffocat- 
ing, overwhelming ache of loss. 

IX 

T hat other Ben Pertin who dis- 
tinguished himself with the 
middle name “Yale” sat, filthy, 
bruised and exhausted, ravenously 
tearing with his teeth at the flesh of 
a kind of watersnake, watching the 
skinny young man croon at his 
monster, called an org. 

He was delighted that the other 
human — or near-human, the one 
called Redlaw — had found his 
equipment and brought it to him. 
But it was badly damaged. He had 
managed to repair the pmal trans- 
lator enough to get across a few 
words to the man and learn their 
names — the youth was called Org 
Rider — but the device was not 
functioning well. All he had been 
able to understand was that Redlaw 
wanted to use him to fight some 
enemies — why, he did not know. 
He also did not know if he had any 
freedom of choice in the matter. 
Was he an ally or a draftee? 

But at least he was alive and he 
had not expected that much when 



THE ORG’S EGG 



87 




the young man had caught him try- 
ing to break open the egg. The first 
thing Ben Yale had tried to get 
across through his pmal translator 
was an apology for that. He hadn’t 
known it was a pet. He had only 
been hungry. Whether the youth 
had understood or not, he could 
not tell. That lean, sharp face was 
hard to read. The young man’s 
words through the spottily func- 
tioning pmal had been hardly re- 
assuring: “Mine . not kill . 
punish . .” 

Now the org was perched on a 
rock, swaying uncertainly as it re- 
garded the watersnake in Ben 
Yale’s hands. Pertin turned, watch- 
ing the creature over his shoulder. 
It was still learning to keep its 
balance. Wings not yet unfolded, it 
looked ridiculous, like a trunk- 
faced, big-eyed fish with bird legs. 

The exploring trunk reached out 
toward him and Ben Yale swore 
under his breath. He tore off a 
shred of the watersnake and threw 
it to the org. Org Rider cried 
something, which the Pmal clucked 
over without producing a single in- 
telligible word. From the curtain of 
spray that concealed the cave the 
man named Redlaw called, “He 
says: ‘Meat not spoiled? Not make 
org sick?”’ 

Ben Yale shook his head. “It 
doesn’t seem to be harming me 
any,” he said. The giant muttered 
something to the boy, who stared 
appraisingly at Pertin, then bobbed 
his head. 



“Can give more,” said the giant 
generously through the pmal. 

‘‘I think I’d rather have a 
drink,” said Pertin, not caring 
whether the translator dealt with it 
or not. He pushed past the giant, 
under the shrouding waterfall and 
walked toward the lake, indifferent 
to the others. 

Org Rider followed him, care- 
fully scanning the sky. Pertin was 
not flattered. He knew the youth’s 
concern was not for his own safety, 
but fear he might attract the atten- 
tion of some predator or enemy to 
the cave. 

Pertin knelt on the gravel beach 
and leaned forward on his spread 
hands to drink. The water was cold 
and good, but it gave him little 
pleasure. 

His position, when he thought it 
over carefully, was not happy. The 
giant, Redlaw, seemed to want to 
talk only about weapons — and he 
had none. Weapons had not been 
in the junk the giant had carried 
from the wreckage of the ship. To 
Org Rider Pertin appeared to be 
only an inconvenience, possibly 
useful to taste doubtful meat for 
the org but otherwise a net liability. 
Neither of them seemed in the least 
interested in Pertin’s reason for be- 
ing on their world. What he had 
tried to tell them of the great uni- 
verse outside had been received by 
the giant without comment and by 
Org Rider, apparently, without 
understanding; the pmal trans- 
lator, in its damaged condition. 



88 



GALAXY 




seemed to function sporadically 
with Redlaw and almost not at all 
with the boy. 

Ben Yale Pertin stood up and 
looked around him. He did not 
even notice the beauty of the 
scene — the deep, rock-walled valley 
in which he stood, the lazy waterfall 
behind him, the cold little lake with 
water so deep it looked black, the 
strange, colorful vegetation. From 
the orbiter the prospect of explor- 
ing these jungles had seemed in- 
teresting — to the extent that any- 
thing could interest him more than 
his own misery and loss of his wife 
and future. Back on Sun One, 
when he and Zara had been to- 
gether, this adventure would have 
seemed enchanting, a marvelous 
holiday surrounded by beauty. And 
farther back still, on Earth, before 
he had ever submitted to tachyon 
transmission, when there was still 
only one of him and that one knew 
nothing but cities and crowding, 
this whole scene would have seemed 
a total fantasy. 

Now his eyes did not even register 
its color or its strangeness. It meant 
no more to him than a cell. 

By the side of the lake Redlaw 
and Org Rider were building a fire, 
roasting nuts they had gathered, 
muttering to each other, too far 
away for the pmal to pick up what 
they were saying and try to render it 
into English. 

The giant stood up and walked 
easily toward Pertin. His green eyes 
were cold and judging. He put his 



fists on his hips as he stood before 
Pertin, towering over him by nearly 
two feet, and spoke in his liquid 
tongue, rapidly and at length. 

The pmal, stammering to keep 
up, produced bursts of words: 
“Orgs gone. Watchers gone. Safe 
to travel. Can now find other slam- 
ming machine, other man like you. 
Can find killing things.” 

Ben Y ale Pertin kicked a pebble 
aimlessly into the water. “Travel?” 
he repeated. “You want me to 
come with you somewhere, to find 
another ship with weapons?” 
Redlaw nodded vigorously. “Go 
soon now, two hundred breaths,” 
the pmal rattled. “Travel long, 
hard. You become ready.” 

Get ready? Pertin looked around 
him, almost smiling. What was 
there for him to do to get ready? 
What to pack, what to miss? He 
was ready to go anywhere . 

But for Ben Yale Pertin where 
was there to go? 

T hey did not dare to fly and Org 
Rider’s muscles soon began to 
ache with the unaccustomed strain 
of trying to move at ground level, 
under the cover of the trees. The 
young org wanted desperately to 
fly, so Org Rider’s task was twice as 
hard, for sometimes he carried the 
fledging and sometimes kept up a 
running stream of talk with it, en- 
couraging it to keep hopping along 
on its wobbly legs, cajoling it back 
when it attempted to take off. That 
was what his mother had taught 



THE ORG’S EGG 



89 




him to do — talk to the infant org, 
let it know always that you were 
there. She swore that the orgs could 
even understand words after a 
while, like human children. And 
indeed Babe already had seemed to 
learn what words like “fish” and 
“water” and “meat” meant. 

That was more than the dumpy 
stranger knew. Org Rider had 
gotten over the superstitious fear he 
had felt when he had first seen the 
stranger bending over Babe’s un- 
hatched egg — he could not under- 
stand how this man could be alive 
when a dozen sleeps before he had 
seen him dead. But the puzzle had 
receded into the back of his mind 
and lost its power to instill fear. He 
wanted desperately to ask the man 
about it, but the clacking machine 
the stranger talked through did not 
seem to work well and Redlaw only 
shrugged and reported that he 
could not understand what the man 
had said to him. “The words are 
clear enough,” Redlaw rumbled. 
“He says it was another him. How 
can there be another? He could not 
say.” 

When they had eaten four times 
they decided to sleep. They were a 
good distance from the last place 
where they had seen either orgs or 
watchers, and so they risked build- 
ing another fire and roasting more 
of the green nuts that hung all 
about them. The stranger moved a 
little way apart from them and 
flung himself on the ground — in a 
moment he began to snore. 



Org Rider stroked Babe softly 
along the gently squirming length 
of its trunk and listened to what 
Redlaw was saying about the 
stranger. “He says he comes from 
another world. He knows arts the 
watchers don’t — arts that I think 
are strange and frightening to 
them. But he only speaks of these 
things, he does not have the 
weapons to prove them.” Redlaw 
scowled at the fire. 

“What is ‘another world?’” Org 
Rider asked. 

Redlaw shrugged morosely. 
“What he says about his world is 
not to be believed. He says it is not 
flat.” 

“Not flat? You mean moun- 
tainous?” 

“No, not mountainous. Round. 
A little ball so tiny that men have 
gone all the way around it.” 

“That is unlikely,” agreed Org 
Rider. 

“What is even more unlikely,” 
continued Redlaw, glowering across 
the fire at the sleeping stranger, “is 
that he says our world is also curved 
like a ball. This is clearly false, but 
he holds to it. He says that in his 
place everything is very heavy. A 
man can’t jump much above his 
own height. And he says, let me 
see — oh, yes. He says that although 
there are trees and plants and 
clouds on his world, they do not 
glow of their own light. None of 
them.” 

“How strange! It must be a 
gloomy place. How does one see?” 



90 



GALAXY 




“There is one cloud,” said 
Redlaw. “He does not call it a 
cloud, but it is in the sky, so what 
else could it be? It is so bright that 
its light hurts your eyes and so high 
that it looks quite small.” 

“I have never seen such a thing,” 
Org Rider declared. He peered 
around, squinting through the 
leaves at the great flank of Knife- 
in-the-Sky rising above them. 
“Where is the way to such a place? 
Over the mountain?” 

“Farther! He says you climb be- 
yond the rain clouds and beyond 
the flying rocks. He says you come 
up into a darkness where there is 
nothing at all. The darkness is 
bigger than you can imagine — so 
big that, when you begin to cross it, 
our flatworld shrinks to a point you 
can’t even see, like an org flying out 
of sight toward the top of the 
mountain.” 

“It is all too strange for me,” 
said Org Rider uneasily, stroking 
Babe. “If his world is so far away, 
how is it that he is just a man?” 
“He does not know, he says,” 
growled Redlaw. “He says he and 
his friends came here for learning, 
and that is one of the things they 
wish to learn — how it is that he is so 
like us, though from so far away.” 
“I wish him luck,” said Org 
Rider dubiously. “I saw the ma- 
chine he came in. It made a great 
noise in the sky, like slam-bang- 
bang, slam-bang-bang. But in spite 
of all the noise, it was slower than 
the orgs. They ripped the wings off 



it and tore it apart in the sky. And 
when the watchers caught him, he 
died.” Org Rider added thought- 
fully, “I do not understand how 
that can be, either. But I have seen 
it.” 

Redlaw rumbled impatiently, 
“The man you saw die was another 
like him, he says. Part of that is 
nonsense, for he says it is him and 
says it isn’t him — both. 

“What is not nonsense,” Redlaw 
added somberly, “is that he has 
something the watchers fear. I 
must have that from him, or he 
must die.” 

T hey traveled fast and far and 
the strain began to tell on all of 
them. Even Redlaw grew short- 
tempered and gaunt-faced. In some 
ways his was the most difficult job 
of all. Ben Yale Pertin was ill and 
injured — Org Rider had Babe to 
care for and often to carry, so it fell 
to Redlaw to keep alert for watchers 
or for wild orgs and there was never 
a moment while they were moving 
when he could relax. When they 
rested over the campfire they no 
longer talked amiably — they bick- 
ered. It troubled Org Rider that 
Redlaw seemed sometimes to be- 
lieve in the stranger’s insane stories 
and other times to hate and mis- 
trust him. He could not hear the 
stranger directly. Whatever the 
machine was that Ben Yale Pertin 
wore on his armbands, it seemed to 
respond only to the squeals and 
whistles of the language of the 



THE ORG’S EGG 



91 




watchers, not to normal human 
speech. So Org Rider could only 
communicate with him through 
Redlaw’s imperfect understanding 
and he was not sure how much was 
getting across. 

Conscience made him try to cor- 
rect some of the stranger’s errors. 
“I have thought,” he told Redlaw 
gravely, “and Ben Yale Pertin is 
wrong about our flatworld. It is not 
round — my mother has told me 
this. And also I understand how he 
looks so like us.” 

Redlaw scowled at him, then 
guffawed. When he was done 
laughing he chirped for a moment 
in the language of the watchers, 
then turned to Org Rider. “Ben 
Yale wishes to be enlightened, 
young one,” he said, his tone half 
laughing but not pleasantly. “So do 
1. Please tell us what your mother 
has to contribute.” 

The boy said stubbornly, “It is 
truth, all people in my tribe agreed 
to that. The flatworld was made by 
the makers.” He peered into the 
fire, trying to remember exactly. 
“My mother used to say they were 
terrible beings, taller than people, 
shining with a light of their own. 
They sang deathsongs — and the 
songs themselves killed those who 
displeased them.” 

He waited for Redlaw to finish 
translating and chuckling, then 
went on: “My people came from 
seven eggs the makers had made, in 
a cave down under the bottom of 
the world. The eggs were guarded 



by seven keepers, but still they were 
stolen by the watchers. The evil 
creatures first blinded the keepers 
with death-weed dust, then stole 
the eggs for a feast. As our guest 
would have done with my org,” he 
added carefully. 

Redlaw choked, but managed to 
translate and receive a reply. “He 
apologizes again for that,” he re- 
ported. “He says he was hungry 
and did not know better.” 

Org Rider nodded and went on. 
“The feast was to be at the top of 
the Watchman’s tower, where the 
blinded keepers couldn’t climb. 
But the makers were angry when 
they found the keepers blinded and 
the eggs gone. They did not sing 
their deathsong, but they sang a 
special song for the wild orgs. And 
the orgs heard it as they flew over 
Knife-in-the-Sky. 

“Seven wild orgs dived on the 
feast and carried the seven eggs in 
different directions, all around 
Knife-in-the-Sky. The orgs hovered 
over the eggs, keeping them warm. 
When each egg hatched, it pro- 
duced a boy and a girl and two of 
every creature that is useful to man. 

“But the watchers spied where 
the orgs had gone — all but one. One 
by one, they found the eggs just as 
they hatched and devoured the 
hatchling creatures and killed the 
orgs that guarded them. 

“But the seventh org they did not 
kill. It flew out into the shadow- 
world, where Knife-in-the-Sky 
hides the flatworld from the Watch- 



92 



galaxy 




man’s tower. Here the hatchlings 
escaped. Green grass sprouted 
from the droppings of the crea- 
tures. The boy baby and the girl 
baby were nursed by the wild org 
that had saved them. They grew to 
be man and woman and became 
the parents of all our people. 

“And what has come to me,” 
ended Org Rider gravely, “is that 
one of the other eggs did in fact get 
safely away, and its hatchlings were 
the parents of Ben Yale Pertin.” 
Org Rider paused. The giant was 
laughing boisterously. “What rot, 
boy! Ignorant superstition!” 

Org Rider leaped to his feet. “It 
is as my mother told it to me, 
Redlaw.” 

“It is nonsense,” Redlaw insist- 
ed. “You should spend a few sleeps 
with the watchers sometime. You’ll 
learn the difference between savage 
myths and scientific truths. I do not 
know whose superstitions are worse, 
yours or Ben Yale Pertin’s.” 

“And what then is truth, Red- 
law?” Org Rider demanded stiffly. 

“Ah, that I don’t know,” the 
giant confessed. “Some of the’ 
things Ben Yale Pertin says may 
have truth in them somewhere. He 
says our world may be hollow — ” 
“Hollow?” Org Rider cried 
scornfully. 

“Yes. Does that seem unlikely? 
It does to me, too, and yet I know 
there are levels below. The tower of 
the Watchman guards one of the 
gates to those levels. I have been 
there while a captive of the 



watchers — and I know. And there 
is some truth in what your mother 
told you, too, I think. There are 
such things as keepers and 
watchers.” He was silent for a time, 
staring across the fire at the sleep- 
ing stranger. Then he stood up. “It 
is time to sleep,” he said, his voice 
hardening. “We are wasting time.” 

F ast and low, they kept going. 

They were halfway around the 
thrust of Knife-in-the-Sky’s largest 
bastion, carried by Redlaw’s driv- 
ing purpose. For Org Rider that 
purpose seemed strange and re- 
mote. He could understand Red- 
law’s burning hatred of the 
watchers, who had enslaved him 
and threatened his life, but now 
that they were free of the watchers 
it seemed pointless to seek revenge. 
Org Rider himself was most oc- 
cupied with his young org, which 
seemed to grow in size, intelligence 
and maturity with every breath. 
When Org Rider awoke, it was to 
the infant org hopping unsteadily 
toward him, seeking not food — he 
was capable of finding his own well 
enough by now — but affection, the 
ritual rubdown of his golden fur 
with a handful of moss. Org Rider 
did not neglect the duties his 
mother had described to him. In 
particular he talked to the org, 
crooningly, repetitiously, and was 
rewarded by having Babe repeat 
some of the words to him. If it 
mangled some of the syllables, it 
nevertheless made itself clear. 



THE ORG’S EGG 



93 




Babe’s stubby wings began to un- 
fold as Org Rider groomed them. 
Tapered triangular fins, they had 
been molded invisibly into his sleek 
flanks. They looked almost too 
thick and too narrow to be useful in 
flight, but Org Rider’s caressing 
fingers could feel their muscular 
power. 

He decided to show Babe what 
they were for. He climbed a rock, 
the org hopping after him. Org 
Rider spread his arms, flapped 
them as he leaped toward another 
rock. 

To his surprise. Babe understood 
at once — so quickly that before Org 
Rider had reached his goal. Babe 
came sailing over him on quivering 
wings. 

Org Rider shouted in delight — 
but his delight faded and congealed 
into panic, as the org kept going, 
past him and up, up over the shel- 
tering leaves of the forest screen. It 
wheeled in a climbing spiral, and 
screamed with a sound the boy had 
never heard it make. 

Fear took the boy’s breath. Was 
Babe calling to the wild orgs abovo 
the cliffs? He looked back to his 
companions for help. Redlaw 
sound asleep under a mossy rock. 
Ben Yale Pertin was watching apa- 
thetically. Without thinking, Org 
Rider crouched and kicked himself 
into the air, using every bit of 
strength in his legs and body, 
leaping a dozen times his own 
height, straight at the wheeling org. 

Babe saw him and joyously dove 



to meet him. His young clumsiness 
made them collide, spinning Org 
Rider off balance, knocking the 
breath out of him. But the org was 
up to the needs of the moment. Org 
Rider felt the velvet trunk coil 
around him protectingly. Strong 
and supple, it held him, then lifted 
him to the org’s sleek-furred back, 
just above the rippling wings. 

Org Rider raised his voice in a 
shout of triumph. “Now I am truly 
Org Rider! Faster, Babe! Faster 
and higher!” 

The org echoed in its piping 
voice: “Faster, Babe! Faster, 
faster!” 

Org Rider clung with his knees, 
fists locked in the golden fur, lean- 
ing against the wind of their flight. 
The throb of wings became a purr 
as Babe dived across the treetops, 
climbed again and wheeled toward 
a clearing, so close above the 
yellow-bladed shrubs that Org 
Rider saw the giant moths flutter- 
ing about in terror. His first alarm 
became a wild elation. His own 
wings had never lifted him with 
such speed or strength. He clapped 
the org’s golden flank and called 
into the wind, “Good, Babe — 
good!” 

And the org piped happily, 
“Good Babe!” as it circled and 
dived again. 

Org Rider found that Babe 
would respond to voice and tug of 
fists and kick of heels. Thought- 
fully he drove the org back toward 
the clearing where the giant moths 



94 



GALAXY 




fluttered and cried, “Food, Babe! 
Get it!” 

“Food Babe!” echoed the org 
and showed its understanding by 
diving at one of the moths to catch 
it in spread talons. “Home Babe?” 
it piped questioningly. 

Org Rider cried, "Yes, Babe, 
home! We’ll cook it and eat it. 
You’ve earned your food this 
time!” 

They flew high while Org Rider 
searched the flank of the mountain 
for the place - where they had left 
Redlaw and Ben Yale Pertin. All 
the trees looked alike to him, all the 
clearings much the same. He 
caught a glimpse of something me- 
tallic high on an outcropping, but it 
was not small enough to be Red- 
law’s cleaver or one of the stranger’s 
peculiar instruments. He began to 
feel dismay — and then realized that 
Babe knew better than he. The org 
had already zeroed in on the camp- 
site and was beating toward it 
powerfully. 

When they landed he got of his 
org’s back and said solemnly, 
“Now I am truly Org Rider.” 

Redlaw stared at him with anger 
and a touch of wry admiration. 
“Org Rider, yes,’’ he rumbled. 
“But also a fool. Listen, Org Rider. 
What do you hear?” 

Org Rider, perplexed, stood still, 
ears tuned to — what? A distant 
shrill whistle? 

“Do you hear it? Do you see it?” 
demanded Redlaw. “Over there — 
beyond the trees. High in the sky.” 



Org Rider looked. He had not 
heard it because of the whistle of 
wind in his own ears, but now he 
heard it clearly and saw it, too, 
falling like a thick, blunt spear 
toward the slope of the mountain — 
a ship of the watchers. 

“If they saw you,’’ muttered 
Redlaw, “you will not live to be 
truly Org Rider very long.” 

T he sputtering pmal translator 
on Ben Yale Pertin’s wrist 
caught only a few words, but they 
were enough to warn him. The 
watchers were nearby. 

Pertin did not need to hear more, 
he had encountered the watchers. 
They were the ones who had shot 
his ship out of the sky of Cuckoo. 
In any other world they would have 
killed him, for he had fallen more 
than a mile, but in Cuckoo’s gentle 
surface gravitation he had survived 
with only cuts and bruises. And 
would have missed those if he had 
been less panicked and in better 
shape, he knew. 

That kind of knowledge was no 
comfort. Pertin feared the 
watchers. He feared dying, even 
when intellectually he welcomed 
it — there was no kind of future that 
looked good to him, unless by some 
miracle Zara should appear and 
offer a new life here. That was 
fantasy. Reality was that he would 
die here and would hate it. 

Org Rider, ignoring the danger 
from the sky, was splitting and 
skinning the body of a golden- 



THE ORG’S EGG 



95 




furred creature like a moth, spitting 
it over the fire. The yellow dust 
from the creature’s fur gave Pertin 
a fit of sneezing, but soon the 
aroma of its roasting meat recon- 
ciled him to the dust. When it was 
done, Pertin humbly waited his 
turn. The best bits went to the org. 
Kedlaw had second choice, then 
Org Rider. Pertin came last. But 
there was still plenty left, and it was 
delicious. 

When they had finished eating 
rain had begun to fall, great fat 
slow drops that touched the fire 
and extinguished it. Gray clouds 
fell to the tops of the trees. 

The red-haired giant bounded 
over to Pertin and shouted some- 
thing that the pmal translator 
rendered as: “Rainclouds hide us 
from watchers. Now we go! Org 
Rider has seen your ship. We find 
it— get weapons to kill watchers.” 

“But you have been to the wreck- 
age of my ship,” objected Pertin, 
perplexed. “I had no weapons — ” 

“Not your ship — like your 
ship — ” crackled the pmal. Pertin 
gave up the struggle to under- 
stand — it did not matter. What 
mattered was that they were to 
move again. This time Org Rider 
did not have to worry about his org, 
who flew above them, so he and the 
giant, unfettered, made fast time. 
It was all Pertin could do to keep 
up with them. They kept on and 
kept on. They did not even stop to 
eat, paused only long enough to 
pass around handfuls of roasted 



moss-nuts, now cold and almost 
tasteless — the trio munched them 
as they continued traveling. Three 
times they ate, pausing once to 
drink at a vine-covered stream and 
to relieve their bowels and bladders, 
then hurrying on. 

Finally Redlaw and Org Rider 
stopped and waited for Pertin to 
reach them. 

The giant said, “Look — beyond 
the gray moss, between the boul- 
ders. What do you see?” 

Pertin tried to focus his eyes, 
dizzy with weariness. See? Yes, 
there was something there, some- 
thing bright that caught his eye. 

The glint of light was metal. He 
glanced at the others, then joined 
them in a stumbling, hopping run 
up the gentle slope. And there, 
partly hidden by purple-flowered 
moss, was the wreck of a machine. 

It was not his ship. It was smaller 
and it clearly had been there for a 
long time. The moss had overgrown 
it completely, except for a few out- 
juttings of metal. 

Metal? Yes, clearly it was metal. 
But something was strange about 
it. The color was not clean. It was 
stained with a watery bluish radi- 
ance that looked unfamiliar and 
vaguely ominous. 

He scurried toward it. It must 
have been a man-carrying vehicle. 
Perhaps a machine one of his pre- 
decessors had used. He could not 
say. It was so broken that he could 
not be sure. He tore at the moss, 
peering inside through a dark 



96 



GALAXY 




opening rimmed with shattered 
crystal. A sharp scent stung his 
nostrils — it did not seem to be com- 
ing from the moss, but from the 
bluish coating on the metal. Now 
that he touched it, it felt slick, 
slippery, moist — oddly repellent . 

A bellowing came from behind 
him and his pmal rapped out: “Do 
not touch — not — not — ” 

Confused, he stood up. Redlaw 
and Org Rider were coming toward 
him, anger and concern on their 
faces. “What’s the matter?” 

They stared at him curiously. 
They seemed to be looking mostly 
at his hands. For a moment neither 
said anything. Then Redlaw’s voice 
sounded oddly gentle. ‘‘Clean 
hands,” rapped the pmal translator 
without emotion. “Wipe on moss. 
Do not touch metal.” 

Pertin shrugged, not understand- 
ing. He seemed to have gotten some 
of the blue slime on his fingers. 
Obediently he bent and rubbed his 
hands on the soft gray moss . 

What he was rubbing against, he 
suddenly realized with a heart- 
stopping sensation of nausea, had 
the shape and texture of a human 
skull. 

He clawed at the moss. It was a 
skull! A whole skeleton, in fact, the 
flesh rotted away, but the bones 
still strangely dressed, under the 
moss, in the imperishable plastics 
of an explorer’s jungle garb, red 
top, orange-and-yellow pants, great 
white gauntlets, and on the shrunk- 
en forearm bones the coils of trans- 



lator, recorder, direction-finder, 
timekeeper and all the other regu- 
lation instruments. 

The giant spoke, and the pmal 
chattered: “Danger. Do not touch 
bones. Serious. Be warned.” 

Pertin looked up at them, aware 
of the bluish radiance that clung to 
the bones, aware that it still be- 
fouled his fingers, in spite of his ef- 
forts to rub them clean. 

“Danger?” he repeated dully. 
“Yes, I suppose so, if you say so. 
But you’re wrong about one thing. 
They’re not a stranger’s bones. I 
know those bones very well, and I 
know the clothes they wear, too. I 
ought to. They’re mine.” 

X 

F ar away, around the great bulk 
of Cuckoo, the orbiter was pre- 
paring to transmit its observer 
along the tachyonic path farlink 
had charted to the source of the 
interfering transmission in the 
galaxy. They still didn’t know how 
far it was, exactly. Roughly in the 
direction of Earth, yes — but at ex- 
tragalactic distances that could 
place the source anywhere from 
Rigel to Canoopus and farther than 
that in the line of flight from 
Cuckoo. 

Distance was only one of the un- 
known factors. Would the trans- 
mitted duplicate find breathable 
air and bearable temperatures 
when he stepped out of the receiv- 
ing box — or sphere, or inflatable 



THE ORG’S EGG

bag, or whatever sort of enclosure 
might contain an uninvited guest? 
Convenience alone dictated that all 
the intercommunicating galactic 
races use essentially the same sort 
of equipment. This wild card might 
take any form. 

“I’m glad I’m not going,” an- 
nounced Ben Line Pertin gloomily. 
He didn’t sound glad even to him- 
self. He found precious little to be 
glad about these days and looked 
forward to not much better. 

Venus chimed softly, “I’m glad 
for you, too, Ben Line. Replication 
is less hazardous for an edited form 
like myself.” 

Ben Line Pertin in quick con- 
fusion said, “Oh, I’m sorry. I was 
just thinking — ” 

“That the mission is dangerous 
and unsure — yes. But it is less so 
for me. In any event,” she con- 
tinued melodiously, “farlink has 
chosen me and I have consented.” 

He said miserably, “I am sorry, 
Venus. I’ve been into my own 
troubles and not thinking about 
yours. I know how it tears one up to 
send a self away to suffer or die 
somewhere — I’ve done it often 
enough.” 

The silvery girl looked at him 
curiously. “That is so, Ben Line. 
But — forgive me — in this form it is 
less painful for me. If I were in my 
own true form I would feel there 
was more to lose.” 

“Wait,” the sentient ape named 
Doc Chimp II said, holding up a 
hand that contained a banana. 



“Here’s a message just coming 
in — ” 

It was from farlink. The re- 
creation room of the orbiter had no 
screens, but a signal light next to 
the wall speakers announced the 
source of the message and was 
followed by the computer’s elec- 
tronic voice: “Stand by — ” 

The pnial of each being trans- 
lated the words. 

“Wonder what’s up,’’ mused 
Doc Chimp. “Well, cheers — ” He 
held up his banana in a sort of 
toast. Pertin responded with his 
tumbler, while the silvery girl 
sniffed at cloudlets of luminescent 
mist she sprayed out of an atomizer. 

“Orders,” rapped farlink’s 
voice. “The transmission of Repli- 
cate 4182, known as Venus, is can- 
celed. A newly detected singularity 
in the incoming signals has altered 
the estimate of requirements. Stand 
by for assignment of replacement.” 

“Congratulations, Venus.” Per- 
tin again raised his tumbler. 

“Orders,” rasped the wall speak- 
er. “The substitute for transmission 
is required to proceed at once to the 
tachyon station for replication. He 
is Replicate 5153, known as Ben 
Line Pertin.” 

“Oh, no!” cried Doc Chimp. 

“Communication of regret,” 
shrilled the T’Worlie, Nimmie. 

“I’m sorry, Ben Line,” whisper- 
ed the silvery girl. 

Pertin stood numb. He had not 
expected this — he did not know 
how to respond. 



98 



GALAXY 




“Replicate 5153,” growled far- 
link from the wall speakers. 
“There is great time pressure. Pro- 
ceed at once for replication.” 

“Come on, Ben Line,” said Doc 
Chimp as gently as he knew how, 
taking Pertin’s arm. Venus took 
the other, and the two of them 
walked the ■ unresisting Ben Line 
Pertin along the corridors to the 
radial shaft that led to the tachyon 
transmitter. He let them. He felt 
nothing . 

Nothing while he was on his way 
to the transmitter. 

Nothing (except the sudden, sur- 
prising, hard metal lips of Venus 
against his own, just before he went 
inside) as he entered the trans- 
mitter and stood through its silent 
omniscient scan. 

Nothing when he looked around, 
and realized he was that he who 
had remained behind. 

Nothing while the chimp and the 
silvery girl escorted him back to the 
recreation room, the T’Worlie 
fluttering behind. They chattered 
doubtfully among themselves, then 
pooled their small quotas of open- 
choice mass to buy him two more 
tumblers of his favorite drink. He 
gulped them down, hardly tasting 
them. He was still here, as though 
nothing had happened. But he was 
also there. 

And he could never come back. 

Later — he was not sure how 
much later — came a final message 
of progress from farlink. “The 
transmission," rasped the speakers, 



“has been successful. First ac- 
knowledgment of arrival has been 
received, along with samples for 
environmental analysis. Unfortu- 
nately they are not life-sustaining 
beyond a fairly short period.” 

A small silence fell in the rec 
room before Doc Chimp said, 
“Well, anyway, Ben Line, congrat- 
ulations. You arrived.” 

“1 arrived,” Ben Line agreed. 
“And I'm dead.” 

D own inside the atmosphere of 
Cuckoo, nearly two hundred 
million miles from the orbiter on 
Cuckoo’s far side, the exploring 
team was practicing its flying skills. 

The expedition, so far, was going 
well. From its altitude, miles above 
Ground Station One, miles out 
from the slope of the enormous 
mountain, even Cuckoo looked 
almost small — not the great sweep 
of its surface, to be sure, but the 
detail on it: tiny trees, winking 
bright puddles of lakes, silvery 
threads of river. The scene was 
broken by strange bright clouds 
that sailed above it, each seeking its 
own level and seeming to drop 
glowing spores that gave Cuckoo 
almost the only light it had, bar the 
glow of plants and animals on the 
surface itself. 

The explorers did not know these 
glowing clouds to be dangerous, 
but gave them a wide berth. Any- 
way, there was plenty of room in 
the sky, not only to travel to a desti- 
nation, but for pleasure, too. 



THE ORG’S EGG 




Valkyrie and Zara and the T’Worlie 
took joy in doing loops and barrel 
rolls, soaring far off from the little 
procession of Arcturan robot, 
Sirian eye and husband and re- 
turning. Zara found herself laugh- 
ing from sheer physical joy. She 
weighed so little in Cuckoo’s air 
that it was almost irrelevant 
whether she was flying head up or 
down. She followed the piping, 
frolicking T’Worlie up in a loop. 
Below her the great sloping flank of 
the mountain seemed to subside 
into a plain. Then the plain tipped 
and became a slope that rose in the 
other direction — next it passed out 
of sight completely as she topped 
out her loop and began to come 
down. 

In her earplug communicator her 
husband’s voice, faintly amused 
and faintly annoyed, said, “Will 
you three please stop playing? 
We’d better stay close together. 
This is dangerous territory.” 

Rebuked, Zara flopped over and 
flailed her wings to get her bear- 
ings. The T’Worlie, used to flight, 
darted back and hung before her, 
its batlike face wearing what she 
had to recognize as an expression of 
rueful embarrassment. She burst 
out laughing. 

She caught sight of the silver girl, 
far overhead, power diving toward 
her with great, strong strokes. Zara 
cried, “Come on — race you back!” 

She let them signal agreement 
and start their powerful, effortless 
flight back toward the sober, sedate 



members of the party. Then she 
aimed herself head-first toward the 
three distant dots, folded her wings 
except for a tiny web from wrists to 
hips for control, and activated her 
athodyd. Thrump, thrump, thrump 
thrump . The radioisotopes 
poured heat into measured slugs of 
water, flashed them into steam, ex- 
panded them into the pulse-jet and 
she arrowed toward her husband at 
a hundred miles an hour, easily 
passing the gallant but small 
T’ W orlie , catching up with V alkyrie 
and leaving her behind. Stopping 
was the problem. 

She shut off the jet and tried to 
lose speed by zooming up sharply, 
but in Cuckoo’s wan grip the loss to 
gravity was so small she found her- 
self looping the loop again, in- 
voluntarily, before, laughing and 
dizzy, she was properly back in line 
with the rest of the party. 

Her husband turned to look dis- 
approvingly at her over his shoul- 
der. 

“About time you got here,” he 
grumbled. 

Zara, who was concentrating on 
an even, rippling flow of her wings, 
gave him a docile, absent-minded 
smile. What a butterball he was, 
she thought dispassionately, even 
in his stretched-out edited version. 
His round body and pipestem legs 
made him look like a stork. 

“The Arcturan’s getting a strong 
signal from one of the spotters,” 
Jon added. “That means we are 
getting near one of our objectives — 



100 



GALAXY 




probably a downed explorer ship.” 

“How nice,” said Zara, winking 
at the silver girl. Valkyrie did not 
wink back; her copy of Earthly 
human anatomy was not accurate 
enough for such intimacies. But 
Zara could hear her tinkling laugh- 
ter. 

Three places ahead of her in line, 
the Sirian eye raised itself out of the 
file on its crackling spread of elec- 
tric forces and turned to confront 
her. It had no expression, but she 
read reproof in its stare. The tiny 
sphincter mouth worked convul- 
sively. Zara could hear no sound 
from it — Sirians used sound for 
communication, but the frequen- 
cies were far higher than those 
audible to humans. Twenty thou- 
sand Hertz was a low basso-pro- 
fundo note for them. But the pmal 
caught it and rapped reprovingly in 
her ear: “Estimate: Your use of jet 
propulsion has increased our risk. 
Assumption: Such sounds in past 
have attracted predators. Valida- 
tion: Air-palping reveals three un- 
identified traces moving toward us 
at three hundred and seventeen 
degrees right ascension, minus six 
degrees declination.” 

“Confirmed,” stated the Arc- 
turan robot without passion. It did 
not speak aloud at all. Its talk cir- 
cuits used radio waves, but the 
pmal picked up and faithfully 
translated the message. 

Z ara pressed her elbows into 
her sides and felt herself begin 



to drop. It was not what she had 
intended, but it was better than 
floundering around while she tried 
to adjust her telescopic visor to 
check out what the Sirian had told 
her. She caught a glimpse of some- 
thing at the indicated position, 
realized she was falling farther be- 
hind and below the others than she 
wanted, flapped herself back into 
position and at last got a clear look 
at what the Sirian had reported. 

There were three of them all 
right. Unidentified traces of what? 
She saw a body gleaming like me- 
tallic copper, stubby wings that 
shone silver at the tips; great claws 
that were coming out of conceal- 
ment from under the creature’s 
body in anticipation of combat. 

For a moment she knew terror — 
then she heard her husband’s voice, 
triumphant and challenging. 
“There they are!” Jon shouted. 
“I’ve got’em — ” 

And without waiting for the 
others he aimed himself and fired 
his jet. 

Directly behind him, Zara got 
the full roar of the athodyd as it 
thrumped huge smoke rings of 
steam, thrusting Jon like an arrow 
toward the onrushing orgs. She was 
aware of a confusion of argument 
that the pmals were unable to 
handle — too many beings were 
shouting at once. What they were 
saying was clear enough, but Jon 
Gentry was paying no attention. He 
felt the hunter’s taste for blood and 
he was on the kill. 



THE ORG’S EGG 



101 




The orgs were wise in warfare. 
They split to come at this lone at- 
tacker from three directions at 
once. Against any of the beings that 
were their natural prey the strategy 
would have worked. Against galac- 
tic weapons it was hopeless. 

Gentry’s hours on the practice 
range on Earth had not been 
wasted. The first spark that marked 
the firing of his laser was a miss, 
but the second found a target. 
Three times the cobalt streak of his 
laser reached out to touch an org. 
Three times a creature screamed 
and each time the scream was cut 
off as the blue ray burned through 
scales and flesh. Each org flamed 
briefly, then tumbled slowly and 
ungracefully toward the mountain 
far below. 

Gentry stopped his athodyd and 
returned by wing-power. Zara could 
hear him singing. He swooped past 
her, touching her with what might 
have been meant for a caress — it 
sent her spinning. 

“Got’em!” he shouted. “That 
was worth the whole trip, Zara — ” 

The silver girl chimed, “It is true 
that you killed those creatures. I 
do not think it was wise to attack 
them single-handedly, however.” 

And the Arcturan robot muttered 
through its pmal, “Confirm state- 
ment as to organic creatures. Pro- 
pose consequential probability. Pre- 
miss: Organic creatures are not 
principal adversaries. Second pre- 
miss: Use of laser weapons may 
alert more serious opponents. De- 



duction: Use of laser weapons may 
be counter-productive at this time.” 

“Ah,” grumbled Gentry, “you’re 
just scared — ” 

Illogically, Zara thought with re- 
sentment — all the galaxy knew that 
Arcturans could not be frightened, 
since they were not only nearly in- 
destructible physically but had 
little emotional attachment to life. 

Val chimed, “I suggest we pro- 
ceed to our objective. I have a 
strong spotter trace from a point on 
the mountainside fifteen kilometers 
away, nearly in direction of flight. 
The characteristics are compatible 
with one of the previous exploration 
ships.” 

“Propose we go there now,” 
twittered the T’Worlie. 

“Why not?” Jon Gentry said, 
with careless courage. “I think 
we’ve seen we can deal with any 
problems that come up.” 

Zara dropped back a few meters 
to regard her husband curiously. 
This was a side of him she had not 
known very well. Of course, on 
placid Earth there was little oc- 
casion for physical conflict, but 
even so she could hardly reconcile 
this fire-eyed warrior with the 
gentle, sedentary, rather dull man 
she had been married to for three 
years on Earth. She had never 
questioned his courage. It had 
simply never occurred to her to 
consider it. If she had been aware 
of it at all, she might have consider- 
ed it as a sort of mildly disturbing 
anachronism, like an excess of 



102 



GALAXY 




body hair or a desire for raw meat. 

She was jolted out of her reverie 
by a sudden gabble in the pmals. 
Once again several members of the 
party were speaking at once. The 
first clear transmission was from 
Val, who called out, “I think we are 
in trouble — ” 

The trouble was confirmed by 
the Sirian’s little sphincter mouth, 
which squeaked its inaudible mes- 
sage that the pmal translated as: 
“Air-palping now registers three 
new high-speed traces vectoring 
toward us. Correction. Four traces. 
Correction — five — six — six-plus 
traces. Points of origin widely 
separated. Suggest indications are 
technological intervention is now 
occurring.” 



T ’worlie and humans, plus 
Val, tried desperately to see 
what the Sirian and the Arcturan 
had detected. Even for Val, how- 
ever, the approaching objects were 
still out of sight, but Val confirmed 
the location. 

“I have the trace,” she agreed. 
‘‘Recommend seeking cover,” 
chattered the pmal, responding to 
the Arcturan’s signal. 

Jon Gentry snorted, “What, run 
away? We’ve got weapons — let’s 
use them.” 

Val pealed, “That is counter- 
survival, Jon Gentry. I have an al- 
ternative proposal. You organics 
seek cover. The Arcturan and I will 
intercept the arrivals.” 



“Concurring,” chattered the Arc- 
turan at once. 

“No bloody chance!” Jon Gentry 
blazed. “I guess you don’t know 
much about Earthmen — fighting’s 
nothing strange to us. We came 
here to carry an equal share of the 
load and that includes fighting. 
We’re not going to hide behind a 
bunch of aliens.” 

“He means,” Zara said quickly, 
“that we feel an obligation to help. 
And honestly, Val — don’t you think 
we can take care of ourselves?” 

The silvery girl swept her great 
wings up to a point over her head, 
thus dropping and turning toward 
Zara. “Doubt it very much,” she 
pealed. “Please study the approach- 
ing objects at thirty-four degrees 
right ascension, eighteen degrees 
plus declination.” She paused while 
Zara struggled with her telescopic 
visor. 

“Oh,” said Zara at last. “They 
are — formidable looking, aren’t 
they?” 

They were that. Blunt spear- 
points, mottled in colors of bronze 
and gray that glinted with under- 
lying metal, were arrowing toward 
the galactic party at supersonic 
speed. At first the explorers saw 
only two. How many had the Arc- 
turan reported? More than six. 

These explorers were not facing 
animals or primitives, but complex 
and powerful technological devices 
and, Zara thought with a sinking 
heart, no doubt armed accordingly. 

‘‘I accept offer,” chirped the 



THEORG’S EGG 



103 




T’Worlie. “Come — ” Nleem stood 
on his head in air and used his de- 
ceptively filmy wings to drive 
himself straight down at the forest 
cover beneath. After a spatter of 
electrical fields he was followed by 
the Sirian eye. 

Zara wailed nervously, “Please, 
Jon — let’s do as Val says.” She 
tried to catch her husband’s eye, 
but he was already higher than she, 
peering toward the approaching 
watcher ships eagerly. “Please?” 
she coaxed. 

“Not a chance,” he snapped. 
"You go ahead. I’m going to fight 
this out!” 

“Then I’d better stay, too — ” 

“No way. Damned if you will, 
Zara — now get out of the way. 
There’s going to be a fight and I 
don’t want to have to worry about 
your getting hurt.” 

Angry and afraid in a way she 
could not define Zara turned 
herself over in the air, aimed her- 
self at the rapidly diminishing 
forms of the T’Worlie and the 
Sirian and activated the pulse jet. 
Thrump, ' thrmnp, thrump — The 
acceleration was terrific. She was 
rapidly catching up on the Sirian 
and the T’Worlie. 

Her previous experience had 
made her cautious. She did not 
want to overshoot this time — to do 
so would mean driving herself into 
the ground. She judged the dis- 
tance as well as she could, allowed 
the jet to build up speed. When she 
gauged she had enough margin left 



she cut the pulse and arrowed down 
on inertia. At the last moment she 
rotated herself and applied maxi- 
mum counter-thrust with the jet to 
slow her fall. 

She had carried out the maneuver 
with considerable skill — as far as it 
went. Unfortunately, she had not 
had much practice with the 
athodyd, neither on Cuckoo nor on 
Earth, where this simplest and 
oldest of jet engines had been 
nearly forgotten. She did not know, 
for instance, that it relied for much 
of its thrust on the augmentation 
furnished by its forward motion. 
When it was reversed it lost a large 
fraction of its efficiency. 

She discovered she had started 
the counter-thrust too late. It 
slowed her headlong drop just 
enough for her to hit the treetops at 
something like thirty miles an hour. 

She hit hard, broke off sprigs 
and branches, went flying through 
a tangle of vines that ripped at her 
skin and bruised her brutally. 
Every snag hurt her, but every snag 
also slowed her, so that when she 
hit the soggy, mossy marsh under 
the trees she merely knocked 
herself unconscious. 

When she came to she was alone. 

She could see very little of the 
sky, but in it were neither husband 
nor allies, nor even the enemy ships 
that had been attacking them; and 
of the T’Worlie and the Sirian eye 
that she had been trying to join 
there was no trace at all.

SCIENCE FACT f JERRY POURNELLE, Ph.D. 

A STEP 

FARTHER 

OUT 

THOSE PESKY BELTERS 



AND THEIR 

T he other day I got a phone call 
from a national magazine, and 
being basically kind, generous and 
always in need of an excuse to stop 
working, I spent an hour with the 
reporter. He wanted a list of ten 
science fiction predictions that have 
proved out and. ten more predic- 
tions which haven’t happened yet 
but will. 

What he wasn’t interested in was 
a list of science fiction predictions 
that just aren’t going to happen. 
Except in rare moods, neither am I. 
But I’ve just finished reading the 
death-knell for poly-water (it turns 
out poly-water isn’t a new form of 
water at all; it’s just a product of 
dirty laboratory glassware) and 
that, plus the phone call, got me 
thinking about nice ideas that just 
won’t work. 

One of the favorite sf themes is 
the “Belter Civilization” and its 
battle for independence from the 



TORCHSHIPS 

colonial masters on Earth. Belters 
are asteroid miners — they flit from 
asteroid to asteroid, slicing them 
up for the mineral wealth they pre- 
sumably contain. 

In the usual story the miners go 
off on long prospecting tours, 
leaving their families on a “settled 
rock” — the Belt Capital (generally 
Ceres) or some other major body. 
When Belters get together, it’s 
always in an asteroid city. 

The Belters never come to Earth 
or any other planet. Indeed, they 
regard planets as “holes,” deep 
gravity wells which can trap them 
and use up their precious fuels. The 
assumption is, of course, that it’s 
far less costly to flit from asteroid to 
asteroid than it is to land on a 
planet or even get into close orbit 
around one. 

Another common assumption is 
that fuels are expensive and scarce, 
and the Belters must conserve 



105 




them — thus they never go outside 
the Belt if they can help it. (One 
supposes there’s a local source of 
both energy and fuel in the Belt, of 
course, or there couldn’t be a Belter 
Civilization to begin with.) 

Fuel and energy aren’t the same 
thing, by the way. Fission reactors 
could provide the power for a per- 
manent Belt station; if we wanted 
to we could put a reactor onto an 
asteroid now. 

But rocket fuels are something 
else again. To make a rocket work 
you must have reaction mass, some- 
thing to get moving swiftly back- 
wards and dump overboard. Unfor- 
tunately, asteroids are rock, and 
rocks don’t make very good rocket 
fuel. We’ll come back to what the 
Belters might do about that later. 

For the moment, let’s see how 
difficult travel to and in the Belt 
would be. We’ll use the same 
measure as last month, the total 
change in ship velocity required to 
perform the mission. This is called 
delta-v, and you should recall that 
a ship with a given fuel efficiency 
and ratio of fuel to non-fuel weight 
will have a unique, calculable 
delta-v. It doesn’t matter whether 
the pilot uses that delta-v in little 
increments or in one big burn: the 
sum of velocity changes remains the 
same. 

We’ll consider delta-v in kilo- 
meters per second (km/sec). By the 
way, I use metric system in all my 
tables and figures because there’s 
no question about that sf predic- 



tion. The English system of mea- 
sures will be as dead as the dodo 
within our lifetimes. Already De- 
troit is changing from the old SAE 
(Society of Automotive Engineers) 
standards to metric because so 
many US automobile parts are now 
assembled in foreign countries. The 
US Army is on a modified metric 
system now. Most businesses with 
extensive overseas trade must deal 
in metrics, and even the English are 
abandoning the English measure- 
ments. I also use the metric system 
to help me stay familiar with it, and 
I’m learning to “think in metric.” 
You should try to do so as well. 

It takes about 8 km/sec to get 
from Earth orbit to an asteroid. By 
comparison you can reach a Jovian 
outer moon for only 6.6 km/sec. 
The asteroids are hard to reach be- 
cause not only are they a long way 
out, but they don’t help you catch 
up to them. They’ve so little mass 
that you have to chase them down. 
Jupiter, on the other hand, will give 
you an assist. 

Thus it isn’t easy to go from 
Earth orbit to an asteroid. (I’m as- 
suming that we have a launching 
system like that described last 
month, so that travel into and out 
of Earth orbit is “free”.) Yet, travel 
from, say, Ceres to a theoretical 
asteroid 2 AU out takes only about 
3 km/sec. (One AU or astronomi- 
cal unit is the distance from the 
Earth to the sun and is 93,000,000 
miles, or 149,500,000 = 1.5 x 10° 
kilometers. Ceres is 2.8 AU from 



106 



GALAXY 




the Sun.) 

This looks pretty good. We’ll 
save a lot of energy if we simply stay 
in the Belt, as is assumed in most 
sf stories. Of course, it takes only 
about 3 km/sec. to get from the 2 
AU rock to Mars orbit (landing 
would take a lot more), but perhaps 
the Marsmen won’t like having 
crude asteroid miners on their 
planet, or won’t be able to provide 
a laser-launch system to get them in 
and out of Mars orbit. The Belters 
could build themselves a Capital at 
some convenient place such as 
Ceres just as easily anyway. 

But how long will it take to get 
from asteroid to asteroid? We’ve 
calculated the energy requirements 
for Hohmann transfer orbits, and 
to use them you must start and 
finish with the origin and destina- 
tion precisely opposite the sun. If 
you try to use something other than 
Hohmann orbits, the energy re- 
quirements become ridiculously 
high, as we'll see in a minute. 

Well you get a launch window 
each synodic period. A synodic 
period is the time it takes two 
planets, or planetoids, to go around 
the Sun and come back to precisely 
the same position relative to each 
other — from, say, being on oppo- 
site sides of the Sun until they’re in 
opposition again, which is what 
we'll need for a Hohmann journey. 

The synodic period of Ceres and 
the 2 AU rock is slightly over 7 
years. Worse, the closer the aste- 
roids are to each other, the longer 



their synodic period. It’s almost as 
bad for the 2 AU rock and Mars: 
nearly 6 years. Add to that the 
transit time, 1.8 years travel time 
between Ceres and the other aste- 
roid, and you see what’s wrong with 
the Belter Civilization. They aren’t 
going to visit their Capital very 
often. 

By contrast, you can get from 
Earth to the asteroids every year 
and a half, spending another year 
and a half in transit. 

Perhaps, though, we haven’t 
been quite fair to the Belters? 
Asteroids aren’t all as widely 
separated as Ceres and the 2 AU 
rock. Most textbooks claim the 
asteroids are concentrated between 
2.1 AU and 3.3 AU out from the 
Sun. We’ll assume they’re all in the 
same plane (they aren’t), so the 
Belt area works out to 4.6 x 10? 
square centimeters. The books say 
there are about 100,000 asteroids 
visible with the Palomar Eye, but we 
want to be fair (and make things 
simple) so we’ll assume there are 
460,000 asteroids interestingenough 
to want to visit, or one every 10 
cm- within the Belt. That means 
the asteroids lie on an average of 
10 2 ! cm apart, which happens to be 
10 km or one million kilometers, 
about three times the distance from 
Earth to the Moon. 

That far from the Sun’s influ- 
ence — and only going a million 
kilometers anyway — we don’t have 
to use Hohmann orbits. One of the 
usual SF Belter devices is the torch 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



107 




ship, which accelerates half-way to 
it’s destination, turns over, and de- 
celerates the other half. We’ll try 
that. 

Once again, we’re in trouble. We 
can’t accelerate at more than about 
.001 gravity, because otherwise the 
total delta-v exceeds any ship we 
can build in the near future. Even 
at 1 cm/sec 7 acceleration, a thou- 
sandth of a gee, that lousy million 
kilometers eats up 6.3 km/sec 
delta-v — enough to get us from 
Earth to a Jovian moon! If we tried 
the trip at a full gee acceleration, 
we'd use 200 km/sec or enough for 
ten round trips from Earth to 
Ceres, and all we’ve gone is from 
one rock to another. 

Clearly, we need better ships. We 
can’t use Hohmann orbits and the 
rockets of the near future to build 
our Belt civilization because it 
takes too many years for the Belters 
to get together. We can’t use 
continuous acceleration. Even if we 
could, we could only get from one 
rock to another in a very small 
region of the Belt. Oh sure, three or 
four asteroids in a cluster might 
band together, but they’d be totally 
isolated from the rest of their fellow 
Belters. 

Our picture of the tight-knit Belt 
society, comprising hundreds of 
small worldlets, is vanishing fast. 
It’s obvious, then, that we need 
real torchships. Craft that can ac- 
celerate continuously at a full 
gravity. After all at a full gee a 
torchship can go 2 AU in four days 



and get all the way out to Pluto, 40 
AU, in less than three weeks! With 
those ships the Belt cities are no 
further apart in travel time than 
were Virginia and New England in 
Colonial times. 

Before we get too enthusiastic 
about the torchships though, let’s 
look at the delta-vee’s they need. 
The 2 AU trip at a full gravity takes 
3,460 km/sec; and the Pluto trip of 
40 AU eats up 15,500 km/sec, or 
more delta-v than the entire US 
and Soviet space programs to date. 

Recall also that it only took 10 
km /sec to get from Earth to Ceres 
and you see the problem. With 
torch-ships, there’s no trip in the 
solar system that you can’t easily 
make. Why bother avoiding the 8 
or 9 kni/sec penalty for landing on 
Mars or going to Earth when you 
have thousands of kilometers-a- 
second to play with? The “holes” 
aren't very deep compared to your 
capabilities, and Earth is still likely 
to be closer to any given asteroid 
than will the Belt Capital, simply 
because Earth is closer to the Sun. 
There’s a good chance that your 
Capital is on the other side of the 
system. 

Furthermore, it’s very hard to see 
how the torchships will work. In the 
old days they were “atomic power- 
ed” rockets — usually a fission pile. 
Well, we already have those, or very 
nearly had them. It was called 
NERVA. and it wouldn’t do any- 
thing like that. NERVA is an 
atomic pile through which hydro- 



108 



GALAXY 




gen is poured. The pile heats the 
hydrogen which therefore goes 
aft, fast, and the rocket moves. 

We could have built a NERVA 
engine by the end of this decade. 
The development was moving very 
well when Congress decided to 
cancel the program. Incidentally, 
more money is annually spent on 
lipsticks in New York State than 
NERVA was costing, and any 
medium sized state has more 
annual sales of liquor than NERVA 
cost over its lifetime. It’s nice that 
they don’t waste the taxpayers’ 
money on frivolities like space. 
Editorials aside, NERVA would 
have been the key to manned ex- 
ploration of the solar system, and 
it’s reasonable to assume that 
somebody, someday, will use it for 
that. 

Given reasonable mass ratios, 
NERVA would have had a delta-v 
capability of between 10 and 30 
km/sec. Not enough to use it as a 
torchship, but enough to get you 
out to the Belt and let you have a 
look before coming home. Enough 
to let you explore Mars from orbit 
and land if you carried an expend- 
able landing module. 

It wouldn’t have been a ship that 
you could build the classical Belter 
civilization with, yet NERVA is 
about the best thing we can foresee 
for many years. 

Well, if NERVA, a fission 
system, won’t do for a torchship, 
what about a “true” nuclear rocket: 
one that uses controlled fusion? 




The Secret Galactics

entire field of science-fiction— one 
of his greatest novels. “The Secret 
Galactics” is a taut and exciting 
tale of battle for control of the world 
between a group of alien creatures 
disguised as ordinary humans— 
and— the still-living but disem-

Thermonuclear reactions surely will 
give enough energy for torching, 
won’t they? 

Not by themselves. There’s plenty 
of energy in fusion, but how do you 
contain it? On Earth, with huge 
tokomak rings generating enor- 
mous magnetic fields, we might be 
able to build a magnetic pinch- 
bottle to hold a controlled fusion 
reaction — although nobody’s done 
it yet — but aboard a space ship? If 
you can build something light 
enough to go aboard a ship smaller 
than the Queen Mary and able to 
contain controlled fusion, you’ve 
got a device that will do far more 
than power a space ship. It’s ob- 
viously a defense against hydrogen 
bombs to begin with. We’ll discuss 
various properties of fusion power- 
ed ships some other time. 

In order to get really efficient 
rocket engines you need high ex- 
haust velocities. To get high ex- 
haust velocities you need high par- 
ticle energies. To get high particle 
energies you must have very high 
temperatures. Even the best 
NERVA systems have to handle 
temperatures of between 10,000 
and 50,000° C, while the worst of 
the fusion systems have tempera- 
tures ten to a hundred times that 
high. No materials known can with- 
stand them no matter how many 
tricks you employ. (Such as routing 
the cold fuel through the pile and 
chamber walls to cool them.) 
Fusion ships don’t merely need 
fusion. They need an entirely new 



technology, and we’ve not even 
made a start towards that. 

Well, what can the poor Belters 
do? We’ll assume they have 
medium quality NERVA type ships, 
so that they can get around from 
Earth to the Belt, but what will they 
use for fuel? They can’t take it all 
with them or they’ll have no pay- 
load at all. NERVA ships use hy- 
drogen, and there isn’t a lot of 
hydrogen out among the asteroids. 

Oddly enough, there is a propul- 
sion system that gets terrific effi- 
ciencies, doesn’t have excessive real 
temperatures, and can be b.uilt 
right now. Even better, it’s likely 
we can find fuels for it in the Belt. 

This is the ion drive ship. Ion 
drives employ metal vapors as fuel, 
and the metal is accelerated by 
magnetic fields, not heat. If the 
asteroids turn out to be rich in 
metals, some kind of ion rocket 
may be just what the Belters need. 
It lets them get fuel from the rocks. 

It won't, however, be a torch- 
ship. A mercury vapor ion engine, 
for example, although capable of 
perhaps 100 km/sec total delta-v, 
only gives thrusts of about 10-: 
gravity. You travel very efficiently 
with ion drives, but it takes a long 
time. 

No, the conclusion is obvious. 
With anything foreseeable in the 
way of rockets, the Belters aren’t 
going to develop their civilization. 
They won’t have ships good enough 
to let them reach each other. If they 
do get such ships, it will be as easy to

All values are in km /sec. Values below the diagonal are delta-v's needed to go from orbit around one satellite to 
orbit around the other, landing on neither. Values above the diagonal are surface-to-surface velocity change 
requirements. Diagonal values are the circular orbital velocities of the moons. 





reach Earth as the other asteroids. 
With real torchships, both the 
Belters and the Earth Navy will 
have no trouble getting anywhere. 
Without them, the Belters are 
better off operating from Earth 
orbit than from their rocky Capital 
in the Belt. 

I'm afraid the Belter Indepen- 
dence Movement is a long way off. 

What with science robbing sf 
writers of Mars and Venus, and 
now the Belters, it’s all rather sad. 
So I’ve been looking for something 
more cheerful — and 1 think I’ve 
found it. 

Recall that it only took about 7 
km/sec to get to one of the Jovian 
Moons. There are rather a lot of 
those moons, they’re respectable in 
size, and they may well have water- 
ices, or methane, or some other 
source of hydrogen on them: fuel 
for a NERVA engine without 
having to send back home for it. 
The Jovian Moons offer a distinct 
possibility for a multi-world civili- 
zation. 

The basics of travel near Jupiter 
are given in Table One. We’ve had 
to assume a lot of things about 
densities and the like to get these 
numbers, and by the time this 
appears some of the figures may be 
out of date. Pioneer will encounter 
Jupiter during the interval between 
now and the time this is published. 
I’ll be the first to cheer if Pioneer 
makes hash of my assumptions. 

Presuming it won’t, let’s look at 
travel amongst the Jovian Moons. 



Except for Amalthea down there 
close to Jupiter, the delta-vees are 
very reasonable, and we can do it 
all with NERVA-style ships. More- 
over, the travel times are very short, 
and you get favorable geometry for 
a Hohmann transfer every couple of 
months or so. The four big Galilean 
Moons (J-I through J-IV) take 
about as much delta-v to travel 
among as it took to get from Earth 
in the first place. Yet you do it in 
weeks, not years. If there’s hydro- 
gen on the Gallileans — and it looks 
very reasonable that there will be — 
fueling your NERVA will be no 
problem at all. 

The outer three rocks are ex- 
tremely easy to travel among. You 
could do it with a backyard rocket 
burning kerosene. Since those 
moons are probably captured aste- 
roids, they’re as likely to be inter- 
esting as any of the other rocks the 
Belters are concerned about. 

The Jovian Moons are compacted 
together. They’re hard to get to 
from Earth, and easy to travel 
among when you’ve got there, and 
if there’s wealth in the asteroids, 
there will be wealth in the Jovians. 
It all adds up to a powerful in- 
centive for the colonists to deal with 
each other more and with Earth 
less. 

So we can end on a cheerful note, 
saying goodbye to the Belters, but 
also making ready to greet the 
Minister Plenipotentiary and Am- 
bassador Extraordinary from the 
Jovian Moons.

TIME AND DUCKWORTH 




Another Duckworth concoction — 
created on the spur 
of the moment! 



LARRY EISENBERG 



I t was a new pocket watch, a gift 
from my wife with a loving in- 
scription on the back, and 1 hasten- 
ed to show it to my old friend, 
Duckworth. The great biochemist 
had his long nose into an open 
ledger in which he was slowly ink- 
ing columns of figures. 

“Haven’t you heard about the 
computer?” 1 asked. 

He didn’t raise his head. 
“Whenever possible,” he said, “I 



avoid that simpleminded child of 
Satan. Particularly when I have im- 
portant data.” 

I sensed that something impor- 
tant was in the air and 1 forgot 
about my watch. 

“A new discovery?” 1 asked rev- 
erently. “Something along the lines 
of your macromolecules?" 

“Broadly speaking,” said Duck- 
worth. He closed his ledger with a 
sigh of contentment. "Have you a

minute or two to spare?” 

"I’m always ready to listen to one 
of your great insights,” I said. 

He glared at me. 

"If you don’t stop that nauseat- 
ing sycophantism,” he bellowed. 
‘'I’ll boot you out of here.” 

I lowered my eyes. 

“I’ll be irreverent,” I promised. 
“In that case,” said Duckworth, 
“I’ll tell you what I’m about. It’s 
involved with time.” 

"Time," I mused. “That sounds 
fascinating. I’ve often pondered 
that seemingly irreversible flow of 
physical events. I wondered why it 
should all go in one direction de- 
spite the fact that physical equa- 
tions allow for positive and negative 
values of time.” 

“So did I,” said Duckworth. 
“Moreover,” 1 continued, “these 
events seem to be stored on one’s 
memory as sets of impressions that 
demand quantification into sec- 
onds, minutes and hours. And yet 
Einstein pointed out in his historic 
nineteen-o-five paper on Special 
Relativity that every statement 
of — ” 

“For Christ’s sake,” said Duck- 
worth. “Do you want me to tell you 
or don't you?” 

I subsided petulantly. 

“Not that I disagree,” said 
Duckworth. “It’s just that at the 
moment I’m not concerned with the 
nature of time, but with our ap- 
prehension of it. For example. I’d 
like to try a very simple test.” 

He glanced at his wrist watch. 



“When I say, ‘Now,’ I want you 
to start estimating the passage of 
sixty seconds of time." 

“Talking about watches — ’’ I 
said, pulling out my new pocket 
watch. Duckworth didn’t seem to 
notice. 

"Now!" he cried. 



I struggled with estimating the 
passage of seconds. I could have 
cheated by counting my breaths but 
I didn’t. After an interminable 
period I called out, “Time.” 
Duckworth smiled. 

“It’s only forty-two seconds by 
my watch,” he said. "But don’t feel 
too badly. Most people do worse.” 
“My wife would have been much 
worse," I said. 

“I’ll ignore that bit of male chau- 
vinism,” said Duckworth. “I first 
became interested in this problem 
when I discovered anomalous ef- 
fects of one of the helical strands of 
my macromolecule. I’ve since 
named the substance Perceptron 
and it seems to affect only those 
cortical areas of the brain which are 
concerned with the perception of 
time." 

“Is it similar to the psychedelic 
drugs?" 

“Completely different,” said 
Duckworth. “For example, the 
motor activities of the subject are 
totally unaffected.” 

“How did you find out that Per- 
ceptron affects time perception?” 
“Sweat and toil,” said Duck-

worth. “I had trained a cat to come 
for his feeding at exactly one hour 
intervals.” 

“Really? How did you manage 
that?” 

“First 1 taught him to press a 
lever whenever he wanted milk. 
Then he discovered that unless an 
overhead light was on, he’d get no 
milk. Thereafter I switched on the 
light at one hour intervals. Pretty 
soon he’d only come around on the 
hour.” 

“Did he wait for the light before 
pressing the bar?” 

Duckworth smiled. 

“He did in the beginning, but 
then I stopped using the light. He 
knew it ought to be on, so after a 
while he’d press the lever. If he 
acted too late he got no milk. If he 
was too early he got a mild electric 
shock. In the end, he could esti- 
mate one hour’s duration to within 
five seconds. Considering how 
much trouble you had with estimat- 
ing a minute, you must agree it was 
quite something.” 

“I think it’s incredible.” 
“Then,” said Duckworth, “I be- 
gan to feed my cat controlled doses 
of Perceptron, reinforcing the dos- 
ages with injections. He’d come 
every half hour, then every ten 
minutes and finally every minute.” 
“And what if you injected him 
with water or some other placebo?” 
“He’d arrive on the hour, as be- 
fore,” said Duckworth triumphant- 
ly- 

“Absolutely astonishing,” I said. 



“Have you tried it on humans?” 
“Not yet,” said Duckworth. 
“After I’m convinced of its non- 
toxicity I’ll ask for volunteers.” 
“You’ll never get me,” I said. “I 
like my sense of time perception as 
it is.” 



M y words came back to haunt 
me when I was faced with a 
massive breakdown of my teeth. 
After my dentist, concealing his in- 
tense joy at uncovering a gold mine 
of repairs, described the extensive 
work required, I fell apart. He as- 
sured me that all of it would be 
painless and even showed me the 
gigantic needle through which the 
novocaine would course. 

I arrived home that evening and 
downed three neat shots of Jack 
Daniels in rapid order. My wife 
stood by with raised eyebrows. 

“I’d better hide the typewriter,” 
she said. 

“This trifling amount will not 
make me an alcoholic,” I said. 
“Besides, I'm terrified of the ordeal 
I face in that butcher’s chair.” 

“It will pass,” she said with all 
the calm of someone who did not 
need dental repairs. “The time will 
fly, you’ll see.” 

It was that vapid remark plus my 
deathly fears that reminded me of 
Duckworth's Perceptron. That very 
evening, noting that a light was 
glowing in his lab, I entered the 
chemistry building and pounded at 
Duckworth’s office door. He seem-

ed slightly annoyed at my noisy 
intrusion since he was involved with 
a tricky titration. He beckoned me 
to a chair and continued with his 
work. An hour passed before he 
took any further notice of me. 

“All right,” he said finally. 
"What can I do for you? It must be 
something special to keep you on 
campus after five.” 

“That’s nasty and uncalled for,” 
I said. “I’ve worked around the 
clock whenever the job demanded 
it. And in answer to your churlishly 
phrased question, the answer is I 
do need your help. I want a small 
but effective dose of Perceptron, 
enough to make one hour in the 
dental chair seem like one second. 
However, if you can cut that second 
down further, I’d have no objec- 
tions." 

Duckworth whistled. 

“A thirty-six hundred to one re- 
duction in time perception? That’s 
more than I’ve ever gotten with my 
animals.” 

“I’m desperate, Duckworth,” I 
wailed. “I’ll take anything I can 
get.” 

“Well,” said Duckworth, strok* 
ing his wispy beard meditatively, 
“thus far I’ve detected no unpleas- 
ant side effects in my animal sub- 
jects. But a cat is not a human.” 

“I’m quite aware of that,” I said. 
“And I’ll take my chances.” 

“One small problem,” said 
Duckworth. “I know the exact dos- 
age to produce prescribed effects 
on one of my cats. But I’m sure it

will be different for you.” 

“So what does that mean?” 

“It means that we ought to try 
preliminary dosages first. We can 
even start tonight.” 

"Do you administer it with a 
needle?” I asked apprehensively. 

“You really are gunshy,” said 
Duckworth. “No,” he added. “I’ll 
give it to you orally. But let me 
reiterate what I told you once be- 
fore. Although your sense of time 
perception will be shortened, your 
motor activities should seem nor- 
mal to the outside observer. That 
is, you’ll walk at the usual speed, 
talk normally and so on. But to 
you, it will seem that everything has 
speeded up.”

“I understand,” I said. “And 
now let’s try dose number one.” 

1 was swinging my arm to and fro 
and I placed a tiny pill under my 
tongue. And then the rate at which 
my arm was moving was impossible 
to detect. The movement became a 
blinding blur. An instant later my 
arm movement seemed normal 
again. 

"It’s over,” 1 said. “The dosage 
must be too small, Duckworth. I’ll 
need a longer period than that.” 
"Will you?” asked Duckworth. 
“You’ve been under for four and 
three-quarter hours by my watch.” 

M y trial in the dentist’s chair 
was an eyeblink, thanks to 
Duckworth’s Perceptron. After- 
ward I raced to his laboratory. I 
would have kissed his hands but I 
knew he’d resort to violence. So I 
gave him a brief, lyrical verbal 
report. In conclusion, I added: 
“You’ve produced a boon for all 
mankind to enjoy, Duckworth. It’ll 
get you a third Nobel prize.” 
“Impossible,” he said. “I don’t 
plan to publish a word of it.” 

The room reeled about me. 

“Are you out of your mind?” I 
cried. “Perceptron is the Tenth 
Wonder of the World. You must 
reveal it to all mankind. It will help 
them get through those unbearable 
interludes.” 

Duckworth shuddered. 

“And who is to say what is un- 
bearable? If I make this stuff freely 
available to all, people will be burn- 



ing up large chunks of their lives in 
order to avoid crises. Every adoles- 
cent would want to zip through 
these tortured acne-ridden years. 
Every pregnant woman would 
shrink down those nine months. I 
don’t believe in inflicting unneces- 
sary discomfort on people, but 
some of it is a necessary and im- 
portant part of life. In fact, it may 
well provide the background for 
making pleasurable moments so 
joyful.” 

“Rationalization,” I said scorn- 
fully. “I don’t believe a word of it. 
One could use that same argument 
against every painkiller man has 
devised and believe me, Perceptron 
can be the greatest painkiller of all. 
You must release it.” 

“I’ll think it over,” said Duck- 
worth. 

I did not pressure my friend fur- 
ther. Weeks went by, then 
months. One day Duckworth dis- 
appeared. I was not worried. I 
knew that my friend was wont to 
steal off when heavy moral ques- 
tions needed thinking through. 
And then he reappeared at my 
computer lab, haggard, wan, but 
clear-eyed. I put my arm about his 
shoulder. 

“It’s good to have you back, 
Duckworth. I missed you.” 

“It's good to be back.” 

“Where have you been?" I 
asked. 

“Soul-searching.” he said. “I 
packed a loaf of bread, six bottles

of beaujolais and the Rubaiyat in 
my knapsack.” 

“And what were your conclu- 
sions?" 

“Come to my office this after- 
noon. I’ll give you my answer at 
that time.” 

1 arrived at three o’clock and 
found Duckworth scribbling in the 
ledger notebook. He put down his 
pen and looked at me candidly. 

“I’ve decided to follow your ad- 
vice,” he said. “While 1 don’t agree 
with you, I’ve concluded that these 
qualms are products of my Protes- 
tant ethic, hangups of excessive 
zeal.” 

I put out my hand for Duckworth 
to shake. He stared at it for an in- 
terminable length of time. I wanted 
to ask him what was going on but 
the words simply would not emerge 
from my throat. After what seemed 
like months, I heard sounds teasing 
out of my mouth at an excruciat- 
ingly slow pace. And then it was 
over. 

Duckworth seemed to take no 
note of my difficulty and simply 
shook my hand. 

“Have you no heart?” I asked. 

“No what?” 

“No heart, no sympathy? You 
see me standing there, struggling to 
talk and you ignore it?” 

“Are you out of your head? You 
weren't struggling to do anything.” 

1 was exasperated. 

“Duckworth," I said. “Surely 
you just noticed that I was holding 
out my hand to you for what 



seemed like months to me, trying to 
say something to you — and I 
couldn’t do it?” 

A look of panic swept over his 
face. 

“Come inside to my lab,” he 
said. ”1 want to take a small 
sample of your blood,” 

“What for?” I asked snappishly. 

“Just do as I say and shut up,” 
said Duckworth. 

Grudgingly I rolled up my sleeve 
and let him take a small sample of 
my life's juices. 

“Now get out of here until you 
hear from me,” said Duckworth. 

“You’re being ill-tempered and 
rude,” 1 said. “You probably think 
you have a good reason, but I’ll 
never forgive you.” 

I turned to leave and tripped over 
a Bunsen burner which had been 
carelessly left on the threshold. In 
avoiding a fall, I almost wrenched 
my back out of kilter. 

“See what you’ve done,” I gasp- 
ed. “It'll be a week before this 
agony will subside. Give me a shot 
of Perceptron.” 

“Not on your life,” said Duck- 
worth and, very gently, he eased me 
into the hallway and shut his door. 

F or several weeks he would not 
answer my calls. His lab door 
was locked and he would not re- 
spond to my pounding. I knew that 
he was subject to strange caprices, 
but this one exceeded all of them. 
And then, once again, he reappear- 
ed at the computer lab.

GALAXY 




“I have nothing to say to you,” I 
said huffily. 

“That’s great,” said Duckworth. 
“Then maybe you’ll listen for a 
change. I’ve been doing a careful 
analysis of your blood sample.” 

I paled. 

“What’s wrong with me?” 

He waved his hand reassuringly. 
“It’s all right,” he said. “And it 
isn't. At least you’re all right now.” 
“Was I sick?” 

“In a way,” he said thoughtfully. 
“You see, there were traces of a 
strange compound in your blood. It 
was amazingly like Perceptron ex- 
cept for a sulfur radical that had 
been tacked on. 1 think it’s a re- 
sponse of the body to Perceptron. 
I've been trying some of the blood 
fraction on my cat.” 

"Did he froth at the mouth?” 
“No, but his sense of time per- 
ception stretched out so long he al- 
most starved to death.” 

“Stretched out?” 

“Precisely,” said Duckworth. 
“For every dose you take to speed 
you through some painful crisis, 
later on, at some unpredictable mo- 
ment. the body's formation of anti- 
Perceptron will stretch out some 
time interval to an agonizingly long 
period." 

I shuddered. 

“What if it had come at some un- 
pleasant time?” 

"I couldn’t have phrased it any 
better,” said Duckworth. 

“Then Perceptron is too tricky to 
use?" 



"Much too risky," said Duck- 
worth. “Suppose you’d been back 
in the dentist’s chair when the anti- 
Perceptron formed?" 

I shut my eyes. 

“Please, Duckworth,” I said. “Is 
there any more of that stuff in my 
blood? Maybe a leech is in order? 
Or some old-fashioned bleeding?” 

“I don’t think so,” said Duck- 
worth. “The rate of decay of anti- 
Perceptron is quite rapid.” 

I sat down and mopped my now 
swimmingly wet brow. 

“You were right, Duckworth. I 
was trying to get something for 
nothing. I should have known it 
wouldn’t work.” 

And then a sudden thought 
struck me. What if anti- Perceptron 
were used to prolong pleasurable 
interludes, like lovemaking for 
example. 

“Duckworth,” I said very tenta- 
tively. 

The tiny eyes fixed upon me. 

“1 was thinking,” I said. “It was 
just a novel idea that occurred to 
me." 

Duckworth’s eyes blazed. 

"I know what you’re thinking 
about,” he said. “The very same 
thought occurred to me. And the 
answer is a violent no.” 

“Of course,” said Duckworth. 
“Isn’t that what life is all about?” 

And, wreathed in homilies, we 
retreated to the Faculty Bar for 
some libation that would distort, 
but in moderation, our senses of 
true time perception. ♦

of a man’s soul? 



DORIS PISERCHIA 



M adge carter saw a reporter 
in the back of the courtroom 
take out his lighter to sneak a 
smoke. She tensed in the witness 
chair and her eyes devoured the 
bloom of tiny flame. 

“This is only an inquest, Mrs. 
Carter,” said Paul Reed, recaptur- 
ing her attention. “I hope you 
aren’t upset." 

Madge shook her head. 

“Will you please tell us about 
last Saturday?” 

“But I already have.” 

“And we’re no closer to finding 
out what happened to Mr. Draper.” 
“As I said before, my husband 
and I and Mr. Draper were in the 
laboratory. At one o’clock, Gil and 
Mr. Draper finished dismantling 
the punch-card machine and began 
discussing the next project. As far 
as 1 know, there was no one else in 
the building except for the cleaning 
woman, Mrs. Wells, who was in the 



adjoining room. At approximately 
twenty minutes after one, I opened 
my handbag to look for something. 
A few moments later I looked 
around and Jeff Draper wasn’t 
there. Gil was working at his desk. 
We went to Mrs. Wells and asked 
her where Jeff had gone. She said 
he hadn’t come out of the lab.” 
“And that door was the only 
exit?" said Reed. 

“Yes.” 

“There doesn't happen to be a 
carnivorous machine in your lab?” 
“That isn’t funny!" said Gil 
Carter. He sat in the first row of ob- 
servers. The judge tapped his gavel. 

Reed slowly walked around the 
witness chair where Madge was 
seated. “What about the machine 
that walked out of your laboratory 
and went after . what was the 
bank robber's name?” 

Stifling a sigh, Madge said, “We 
dismantled it.” 



121 




“What about the machine that 
wanted every newborn with crimi- 
nal potential to be destroyed? I 
understand it insisted this must be 
done to save the world.” 

“It was dismantled.” 

‘‘There were other machines, 
weren’t there?” 

“What if there were?” said 
Madge. “Do you think one of them 
was responsible for Jeff’s disap- 
pearance?” 

Reed showed the courtroom his 
smile. “Not for an instant.” 

“It sounds as if you believe my 
husband and I use our laboratory 
as a place in which to tinker.” 
“Not at all. You’re the leading 
electronics experts in the country. 
On the other hand, my task is to 
bring to light any information con- 
cerning Jeff Draper's disappear- 
ance.” 

“I wish you luck,” said Madge. 
“He was a good man. His assist- 
ance on the punch-card project was 
a brilliant piece of work. Of course 
the project was a failure. Too ex- 
pensive.” 

Reed eyed her keenly. “It’s 
generous of you to give him such 
recognition.” 

“Gil and I admired his ability.” 
“Nobody has accused you or your 
husband of anything, but we all 
know Draper is gone.” 

“I don’t know how or why,” 
Madge said in a low voice. 

“Corpus delicti,” Reed mur- 
mured. “Where is his body?” The 
lawyer held out his hand. An ear- 



ring lay there. “This is the only 
thing unaccounted for in Draper’s 
apartment. We haven’t been able 
to trace it to the owner.” Reed 
looked at the witness. “That’s all, 
Mrs. Carter. You may step down.” 
The inquest drew to a close and it 
was declared that without evidence 
there was no case. Jeff Draper was 
gone. The matter would go down 
on the books as an unsolved my- 
stery. 

T hat afternoon Madge stood be- 
fore the open fireplace in the 
living room of her home. Her 
stance was rigid as she stared into 
the flames. 

“Bitch," said Gil behind her. 
"They can’t trace the earring to 
me!” 

“That isn’t what I meant.” 

Her face twisting in a painful 
smile, Madge dropped a bit of 
paper in the fire. “It wasn’t what 
you think.” 

"What do I think?” Gil sounded 
calmer now, but he was pacing 
back and forth. 

“He promised to help me. He 
said he knew a good doctor.” 

“Not that again!” 

“It's getting worse,” she whis- 
pered. 

“Why don’t you carry a bucket of 
hot coals around with you? Then 
you can set your fires on the spot.” 
She turned to him with an ex- 
pression of despair. “You don’t 
understand. You don’t care.” 



122 



GALAXY 




“I understand enough. All you 
need is self-control.” 

“1 need a doctor.” 

“A week ago you would never 
have admitted that.” 

Madge reached to take a note- 
book from the mantle. 

"Put that down!” he snapped. 
“You see?" she said. “It happens 
even when I don’t think about it.” 
Gil started to walk away from her 
but suddenly he turned. “The in- 
quest may be over, but what would 
the police think if they found you 
had been in Jeff's apartment?” 
“What people normally think of 
such a thing. They’d have a motive 
for your hating him.” She gave a 
little laugh. “How wrong they 
would be. It wouldn’t have matter- 
ed to you if he’d been my lover.” 
Once again he paced. “None of 
this would have happened if you 
hadn’t been playing firebug in the 
lab Saturday instead of paying at- 
tention. You might have seen what 
became of him. Of all the insane — 
right there in the lab! Couldn’t you 
wait to get home?” 

“I’ll do anything for you, any- 
thing you say. only let me be 
treated.” 

“My wife isn’t going to a psychia- 
trist. Never mind that. What were 
you burning on the bench Sat- 
urday?” 

“What difference does it make?” 
“Tell me!” 

"Bits of paper,” she said wearily. 
“1 didn’t damage the bench. There 
was an ashtray.” 



“What else besides paper?” 
“That’s all, I swear.” 

He seemed implacable and un- 
touched by the plea in her eyes. 
“Why are you so upset about it? 
What did you do? It had something 
to do with Jeff. Damn you, I want 
an answer!” 

Her eyes were prisoners that 
darted around the room. “His 
replication card.” 

Puzzlement erased the anger on 
his face. “What do you mean?” 
“The punch-card we made on 
him — the machine you dismantled 
Saturday.” 

Angry again, he said, “What did 
that have to do with anything?” 

“I don’t know. He hid the card. 
He said it was his image and that he 
didn’t want it destroyed. I think he 
was on the verge of a breakdown. 
He told me that when he sat in the 
machine and let it copy one of his 
cells it took too much.” 

“Go on.” 

She shrugged. “He was afraid of 
the card. He didn’t like looking at 
it. He said it was his self, that we 
had superimposed the shadow upon 
the substance and that reality 
couldn’t know the difference. Oh, I 
don’t know what he said. I only 
know he was afraid of the card and 
that he was glad the machine was 
being taken apart. He said it would 
be a monster loosed upon the 
world, that nobody should copy his 
soul on a plastic card. My God, 
why are you asking me this? What 
does it matter?” 



SUBSTANCE AND SHADOW 



123 




“It makes no sense!” 

“It did to him. All he talked 
about was substance and shadow. 
He said a copy could be as real as 
an original if it captured essence, 
that even if people couldn’t steal es- 
sence, the replicating machine 
could because it operated on the 
same principle as nature. It worked 
with potential and added to it by 
using whatever was available.” 
“Keep talking,” said Gil. 

“The machine copied one of his 
cells. He said they were embryonic 
replicas of himself, which meant 
the machine was actually copying 
him. But the card wasn’t an accu- 
rate replica unless his essence or 
true substance or inward realness 
was included. He said the machine 
took his soul and after the original 
had its realness stolen the original 
became the copy. Could that have 
happened, Gil?” 

“He couldn’t have believed that 
nonsense.” 



66 AM aybe he did. He began do- 
lVAing weird things, like 
standing under lights and looking 
behind him or staring over his 
shoulder when he was out in the 
sun.” 

Gil stared at her with a startled 
expression. “Why did he do that?” 
“He couldn’t find his shadow.” 
Gil looked at the flames in the 
fireplace, looked at the shadow of 
his wife lying on the hearth. He 
walked toward her until the light of 



the flames bathed him. As he 
walked, he watched over his shoul- 
der. 

“Where did he hide the card?” 
he said, coming to a halt. 

“In the dahlia pot by the window 
in the lab.” 

Their eyes met and his were 
frightened. “You didn’t burn it?” 

“I don’t see that it matters. I 
could find a needle in a haystack. I 
loved the way it burned and sizzled 
and melted. But it screamed — and 
that’s why I think I’m going out of 
my mind.” 

He backed away, almost lost his 
balance, caught hold of a chair. 
“It’s impossible. I don’t believe it.” 

Madge turned and stared into 
the fire. 

‘‘A monster?” said Gil. ‘‘We 
made a monster?” 

“Isn’t everything?” 

“There’s a card of me. Where 
the hell did I put it? Damn it — let 
me think — ” 

Madge raised her head. She was 
aware that he had left the room and 
was hurrying up the stairs. Sighing, 
she leaned toward the fire. The 
heat reached out ot her and 
warmed her frozen spirit. Cold 
from infinity drifted in through the 
crevices in the house. The cold had 
no shape or form, but it had power. 
It could seek her out and annihilate 
her, turn her to a pillar of ice. Her 
only defense against death was 
warmth. Blindly she sought salva- 
tion. Her hand went into her pocket 
and withdrew the plastic card.

She held it out to the fire. They 
had made two cards, one for Jeff 
and one for Gil, and then they had 
taken the machine apart. It was re- 
grettable because the theory behind 
the punch-card was good. A person 
entering the labor market for the 
first time had to fill out a dozen 
questionnaires. Even then he was a 
gamble to an employer. The punch- 
card machine would have eliminat- 
ed the gamble. It copied a body cell 
in a matter of minutes and the card 
it produced was an infallible char- 
acter reference. Each perforation 
was a physiological or personality 
trait. With an auxiliary machine to 
interpret the perforations an em- 
ployer could know exactly what 
kind of person he was dealing with. 
Chemistry couldn’t lie. Psychotics, 
thieves, liars or degenerates gave 
themselves away by their deficien- 
cies or excesses of certain acids and 
hormones. The punch-card project 
could have been a major break- 
through in the understanding of 
human behavior. The card was the 
most detailed identification an in- 
dividual could have. Without it, he 
was an unknown, a stranger, half a 
quantity. 

Madge winced. How could a card 
carry a man’s reflection on it? 
Everything about him, nothing left 
out. Nothing and everything. Were 
they one and the same? What kind 
of universe was it when everything 
and nothing were identical? 

Her cold fingers opened and re- 
leased the card. Gil would be 



angry. He was upstairs hunting for 
it. Why did he care all of a sudden? 
What did it matter? 

The flames took the plastic rec- 
tangle, lapped at its fringes, leaped 
all around it, melted it, consumed 
it. A tiny scream burst from the 
fire. 

She waited for him to come down 
and torment her. He didn’t come, 
though she waited and waited. 
Finally she sent Craddock upstairs. 

The butler couldn’t find Gil. In- 
credibly her husband seemed not to 
be in the house. But he must be 
here. He couldn’t have gone out 
without coming down the stairs and 
Madge would have seen him. 

It was bewildering. She didn’t 
evade the thought that she really 
didn’t care. Her personal problems 
had a way of obscuring other 
issues. 

“What do you think of all this?” 
she asked Craddock. 

“It’s a mystery, madam.” 

“Do you like mysteries?” 

The butler shrugged. 

‘‘He’s gone, like Jeff,” said 
Madge. “Disappeared.” 

“Yes, I think so.” 

“The police will come.” 
“Regrettably.” 

“What do you think of me, 
Craddock?” 

“I have a great fondness for you 
madam. I’ll be happy to inform the 
police that Mr. Carter left the 
house at four o’clock.” 

“You’re a comforting person. Do 
you know a good psychiatrist?” *

O 



I ’m going to talk about only two 
writers this month in any depth, 
and then fling myself into what I can 
only call “housecleaning.” I have a 
backlog of literally hundreds of 
books on which I’ve never had time 
or space to report, and short of 
dumping the lot at the recycling 
center, there’s no other recourse but 
to list them with totally unjust one- 
or two-word comments. I shall 
continue this practice month after 
month until I can get through my of- 
fice without sidling; until my desk 
emerges from the mountain; until, 
perhaps, my ToBe Answered file re- 
appears, and I can begin answering 
my mail. 



C arl sagan began to swim im- 
portantly into my consciousness 
only a little while before that fortu- 
nate moment when I met him per- 
sonally. Without hesitation I place 
him among the five first-class minds 
I have ever encountered. It is impos- 
sible to refrain from Sagan anec- 
dotes. It is difficult indeed to re- 




strain oneself from them, for this 
man is fated to gather legends about 
himself, on the way to becoming 
one. Tall, articulate, with a reso- 
nant voice and dark but luminous 
eyes; astronomer, mathemetician, 
with a vast working knowledge of 
chemistry, biochemistry, physics 
and the complexities of computer 
technology, he is a great deal 
younger than he ought to be and 
looks even younger than that. He 
talks well and straight to the point, 
and he listens as much as he talks, 
and does it with attention so total 
that you can’t just blurt; you find 
yourself testing and checking what 
it is you’re saying to him: is it so, is it 
sensible, do your words say what you 
mean. His do. 

Item: At a symposium Fred Pohl 
read a paper, and afterward Sagan 
came to him and corrected some 
figures Fred had used. Now Fred 
Pohl is a bright and careful man 
who does his homework, and has in- 
stant and total retrieval, and said 
flatly, “I got those figures from Dr. 
so-and-so of the Such-and-such In- 



126 




stitute.” “Oh, I know,” said Sagan, 
with (and you’ve got to believe this) 
not one split iota of brag, “he got 
those figures from me, but he didn’t 
understand them.” 

Item: In the preparation of a long 
and heavy series for Westinghouse 
Radio, my wife interviewed Sagan, 
and presented him with a four para- 
graph question dealing with 1) the 
ecological mess 2) overpopulation 3) 
The Bomb and 4) human cussed- 
ness generally: “In view of these 
things. Dr. Sagan, can man sur- 
vive?” Sagan: "Search me.” 

Item: On walking into the waiting 
room at LaGuardia with Sagan and 
our wives, I was startled to see some- 
one scurrying to unlock the V.I.P. 
lounge for the four of us, something 
one has to get used to in the presence 
of this remarkable human being. I 
should have said “five of us”; my 
then 2-year-old Andros was on his 
usual perch on my shoulders. Due 
purely to an inexcusable lapse on my 
part, Andros cut his forehead open 
on a glass coffee table. There follow- 
ed a nightmarish sequence of 
getting him to a local emergency 
hospital. Sagan came with me while 
his lovely (and very talented) wife 
Linda stayed with Wina. At the ad- 
mitting desk, with bloody Andros 
back again on my shoulders while 
we stood there getting forms filled 
out, Sagan was right there, right on 
top of every detail; he couldn’t have 
been more concerned if it were his 
kid, or for that matter, his head. 
How together I was I’ll never know; 



with him there, there was no chance 
to fumble. We cased the waiting 
room then, waiting; we paced a cor- 
ridor or two. People were in the cor- 
ridors. lying on gurneys, waiting 
too, waiting with that numb pa- 
tience you might see on a mule tied 
up to the hitching rail outside a bar- 
room. A Puerto Rican came up to us 
to ask about the doctors here, be- 
cause he had a pain here, and he 
couldn’t sleep, and . Sagan 
spoke to him gently and simply and 
encouraged him; then they called 
me and I took Andros in to get him 
stitched up. Sagan waited and got 
us a cab. On the way back to the air- 
port he was very silent, deeply 
reached by that whole hospital 
scene, slowly pulling himself out of 
it. Suddenly he smiled and said, 
“Did you notice that girl at the reg- 
istration desk?” “Notice what?” 
“She took one look at Andros, 
sitting on your shoulders with his 
head all bloody, and then she put 
one hand up to her own head and 
kept it there the whole time she was 
talking to us, and she never looked 
up again.” 

Now that, friends and colleagues, 
is the very achetype of what I call the 
“writer’s eye.” Some are born with 
it and some develop it, but no really 
good writer ever lacked it. It’s a way 
of scanning and recording those in- 
tensely human fragments to which a 
reader responds fully and im- 
mediately — those which the rest of 
us miss completely, as did I. 

Not that you need this, or me, to

demonstrate that the man is a 
writer. Try The Cosmic Connection, 
An Extraterrestrial Perspective, 
(Doubleday $7.95. Illustrated and 
indexed, 274pp.) It was produced 
by Jerome Agel (who did the same 
chore for McCluhan’s The Medium 
is the Message, Buckminster Ful- 
ler’s / Seem to be a Verb, and The 
Making ofKu brick's 200 1) and has, 
among its many photographs, some 
exquisite and meticulous drawings 
by Jon Lomberg. On the back cover 
is a rendering of the “Message to the 
Stars” — the gold anodized alumi- 
num plaque carried out into deep 
space by Pioneer 10. Inside the book 
is the story of that plaque, how 
Sagan and his colleague at Cornell, 
Dr. Frank Drake, designed the 
“message,” how Linda Sagan did 
the art, how conception, execution, 
and progress through the hierachy 
at NASA was accomplished in a 
bare three weeks, and even how 
some nameless, faceless bureaucrat 
parted the Earthman’s Afro and 
made a white man of him. You’ll 
read about the 85-page letter in 
green ballpoint which even Sagan 
could not answer, and about his as- 
tonishing adventures in communi- 
cation with dolphins and with first- 
graders, and a flabbergasting exer- 
cise in /jo/f-communication with the 
CIA. And among these expressions 
and inadvertant self-portraits of a 
genuinely fine, warm human being 
is the heavy stuff — lucid, exciting, 
inspiring sometimes, and always ig- 
niting the sense of wonder: black 



holes, calculations on the degrees of 
cultural evolution and on the dura- 
tion of a civilization, meticulous 
you-are-there descriptions of land- 
fall on Venus, on Mars; a guided 
tour among the bureaucracies, 
surely the strangest excursion into 
alien intelligences of all. And this: 

There will be a time in our 
future history when the Solar 
System will be explored and in- 
habited. To them, and to all 
who come after us, the present 
will be a pivotal instant in the 
history of mankind. There are 
not many generations given an 
opportunity as historically sig- 
nificant as this one. The oppor- 
tunity is ours, if we but grasp it. 

To paraphrase K.E. Tsiolkov- 
sky, the founder of astronau- 
tics: the Earth is the cradle of 
mankind, but one cannot live 
in the cradle forever. 

— just in case you were beginning 
to feel bored or cynical about the 
times you are living in. ... And 
then there’s Linda Sagan’s six- 
legged unicorn, with old Sol just 
under his tail . 

Communication with Extrater-

as an acknowledgment to the pre- 
sence on Earth of non-human intel- 
ligence, and a recognition that one 
of the two stars “listened to” by 
Frank Drake for Project Ozma was 
Tau Ceti; and finally, a short handle 
for the conference itself. Partici- 
pants came from the U.S. and the 
U.S.S.R., the U.K., Canada, Hun- 
gary and Czechoslovakia, and they 
were real heavyweights: M.I.T.’s 
Minsky, who is building toward a 
machine that can think, Ozma’s 
and Cornell’s Frank Drake, Charles 
Townes, who invented the maser 
and the laser and got the Nobel 
Prize. Francis Crick, co-discoverer 
of DNA’s double helix and another 
Nobel Laureate; Freeman Dyson, 
mathematician and physicist whose 
paper in the Appendix is, by the 
way, one of the most beautiful 
things I have ever read; Soviet scien- 
tists of equal merit, but oh, I’m 
running out of space. The inter- 
change between these amazing 
minds is worth ten days without 
lunch any time; buy this and keep it. 

I don’t think I can review Barry 
Malzberg’s books as fast as he 
writes them. Not only do they cas- 
cade all over my desk , but there he is 
in anthology after anthology, and he 
has not completely abandoned the 
magazines. I have expressed before 
in these pages how impressed I am 
with this man. I do not see how 
anyone can stay so angry; there is no 
one, with the possible exception of 
Philip K. Dick, whose works, each 



one of them, are so unpredictable 
nor so outrageous and outraged. 
For Beyond Apollo he won the first 
John Campbell Memorial Award — 
it’s out now in paperback (Pocket 
Books, 95c) and his new one, differ- 
ent as it can be, is of equal uncom- 
fortable merit. It’s called The De- 
struction of the Temple (Pocket 
Books, 95c) and deals disturbingly 
with the emotional impact of the 
Kennedy assassinations, together 
with those of Malcolm X and Martin 
Luther King. The impacts of these 
terrible events are not linear as in 
history, but cyclic, as they are in our 
minds and hearts; great events 
occur in these areas over and over, 
sometimes differently, with greater 
or less emphasis and power, and it is 
this that Malzberg’s strange book 
exemplifies. Then there’s Tactics of 
Conquest (Pyramid, 95c) — ugly! 
ugly ! , yet compelling, even demand- 
ing. It’s chess this time, as his Over- 
lav was horse-racing. One needn’t 
know the game to read the book; 
however, love for the game enhances 
the novel. What a strange work! It’s 
a man’s struggle with himself, or 
selves, it’s arrogance undefeated in 
horrible humility; it’s important to 
the exact degree to which you are 
equipped to participate. Hate it you 
might; forget it you will not. What- 
ever . Malzberg will be around 
to perplex and infuriate long after 
most of the rest of us are homoge- 
nized in memory. Dammit! How 
can a man be so much fun and have 
so little joy? *

He faced a fate worse than death- 
in the mind of a woman! 






Foreign Office; Commander Jacks, 
Ministry of Security; Colonel Hand- 
er who, I believe, represents Ameri- 
can C.I.A. — and another gentle- 
man who doesn’t have a name. His 
organization is so secret even he 
doesn’t know whom he’s working 
for. Before we hear from him 
directly, gentlemen, allow me to in- 
troduce Doctor Martin Sawyer — 
about whom so many bitter words 
have been spoken and who is the 
prime object of this meeting.” 
No-name sat up and inspected 
Sawyer critically through a haze of 
cigar smoke. 

“Hold it right there a minute, 
Woulfe. Before we’re in too deep 
I’d like to know something about 
this guy Sawyer. Like whose man is 
he?” 

“In view of your forgetfulness 
about your own employment your 
preoccupation with other people’s 
is remarkable,” said Woulfe. 
‘‘Doctor Sawyer is owner and 
director of a specialist company 
called Laser Metrology.” 

“I don’t mean the cover story. I 
mean which security organization 
picks up his tabs?” 

“None do.” One could almost 
sense a subdued glee in the way 
Woulfe was handling the pro- 
ceedings. 

“You mean he’s a freelance?” 

“I mean that Doctor Sawyer isn’t 
even interested in how this meeting 
turns out. He’s the original inno- 
cent bystander.” 

No-name considered 



“Then how come he screwed up 
Cassius?” 

“I thought we’d already estab- 
lished that,” said Teddington- 
Wright soothingly. “Doctor Cass’s 
indisposition resulted from a plot 
by several security organizations 
who were disturbed by the inhu- 
manity of her interrogation 
methods. It so happened that 
Doctor Sawyer was the instrument 
they used.” 

“Shades of Mitrione!” said No- 
name from behind his cigar. 

“Furthermore, the plot was de- 
signed to kill her. It failed only be- 
cause nobody thought to advise 
Sawyer of what was going on,” 
Wright continued. 

“Son of a bitch!” said No-name. 
There was a hint of admiration in 
his voice. “You mean he uncorked 
her by accident?” 

“It’s just a knack,” said Sawyer 
modestly. “You should see how 
much damage I can do when I’m 
really trying.” 

Colonel Hander, the C.I.A. man, 
turned to Sawyer with a surprising 
show of warmth. 

‘‘Why don’t you take a seat, 
Doctor Sawyer?” 

“Thanks — but having listened 
this far I wasn’t thinking of stay- 
ing.” 

“I don’t think he trusts us,” said 
No-name richly. “Can you imagine 
that?” 

The others laughed, as though 
mutual mistrust between them were 
more appropriate than not. 



WAR OF THE WASTELIFE

“I didn't say that,” said Sawyer. 
“But I’ve a lawyer sitting in a car 
outside with a writ of habeas corpus 
all ready with my name on it. And 
if he should run into trouble — 
there’s a second one up the road 
with a writ with the first guy’s name 
on it.” 

“Joking apart,” said Hander, 
“don’t you think you’re being too 
cautious?” 

“I think not. The last time I be- 
came involved with you security 
types I was handed over to Doctor 
Cass for use in an experiment. 
That’s not an experience I’m 
anxious to repeat.” 

“Let’s come to the point,” said 
No-name. “With Indochina flaring 
up again we can’t afford to have 
Cassius out of action. We need her 
persuasion expertise. Her present 
predicament is not only costing us 
lives — it’s costing us money.” 

“That is a pity,” said Tedding- 
Wright with a non-inflection. 

“I’m satisfied,” said No-name, 
“that all of you were implicated in 
the plot that got Doctor Cass hos- 
pitalized. Now the pendulum’s 
swung the other way. It’s in all our 
interests to get her back into har- 
ness. This son of a bitch — ’’he 
indicated Sawyer without rancor — 
“is holding us for ransom. Let’s get 
down to detail, find out his price 
and get the show back on the 
road.” 

“All right. Doctor Sawyer — what 
is your price?” asked the C.I.A. 
man. 



“Price? I don’t even have any- 
thing to sell.” 

“Do they make them that thick, 
or is it something you have to work 
on?” asked No-name. 

“It’s probably my fault,” said 
Woulfe. “Nobody’s yet put the 
problem to him.” 

“If it has to do with Doctor 
Cass — don’t bother,” said Sawyer. 
“I’m not interested. Not for any 
sort of price.” 

“Is he for real?” asked No-name. 



44XJe’s completely real," as- 
Xlsured Woulfe. “He’s prob- 
ably the only one of us who is. 
Martin — ” he turned to Sawyer — 
“the situation is this. After the last 
mind-jaunt with which you were 
associated, Cassius — that’s to say, 
Doctor Andrea Cass — predictably 
suffered a severe mental break- 
down. Her treatment in America 
hasn’t been effective, which isn’t 
surprising when you consider the 
methods by which the trauma was 
induced. She’s opted to be brought 
back here for therapy.” 

“You won’t treat her?” Sawyer 
asked. 

Woulfe pursed his lips. “Unfor- 
tunately, as a physician I’ve to con- 
sider the Hippocratic oath. She’s a 
sick person in need of treatment. I 
have that treatment — therefore I 
can’t withhold it. I could only wish 
a similar morality bound those who 
employ her services.” 

“How does this concern me?” 



134 



GALAXY 




“It’s a question of gaining access 
to Cassius’s mind. As you know, 
the mental models any mind-jaunt 
explores are coded to make the 
model intelligible only to someone 
who can comprehend the symbo- 
lism. It would take me six months 
to understand her use of imagery. 
But we already know that you and 
she can read each other directly, or 
she wouldn’t be in her present diffi- 
culty. It’s been suggested that you 
do a jaunt into Cassius’s mind to 
perform the necessary therapy.” 
Sawyer said, “What?” so loudly 
that No-name jumped and dropped 
his cigar. “You want me to do a 
mind-jaunt on Cassius?” 

“1 don’t want — Cassius does,” 
said Woulfe. “My own advice is 
that it would be a very foolish thing 
to try. Knowing what your reaction 
would be, I already took the liberty 
of refusing on your behalf.” 

“You’re damned right I refuse. 
One contact with that bitch is 
enough for a lifetime. Sorry I’ve 
wasted your time.” 

“Hold a minute. Sawyer.” No- 
name had risen to his feet and the 
look on his face was dangerous. 
“Specifically, what are your objec- 
tions?” 

“You need them spelled out? 
She’s an expert on brainwashing 
and torture science. From what I 
can gather she’s the most ingenious 
and singularly ruthless operator in 
the game. In my view such people 
shouldn’t exist outside a night- 
mare.” 



“That’s only your view,” said 
No-name abruptly. “But it’s for 
precisely those talents that we need 
her. I’m offering you five thousand 
pounds — tax free — to change your 
mind.” 

“Get lost.” 

“Twenty thousand — and that’s 
my final offer.” 

“It isn’t a question of money. 
Woulfe, I want out of here.” 
“Don’t be in such a hurry, 
Doctor Sawyer.” Commander Jacks 
of the M.O.S. entered the fight al- 
most apologetically. “I’ve been re- 
searching your Laser Metrology 
outfit. Although you’re retained by 
main contractors, most of their 
funding comes from government 
contracts. If you were security 
blacklisted you’d sink like a stone. 
If my sums are right you could 
finish with liabilities touching a 
quarter of a million pounds. How 
does that grab you?” 

“That’s blackmail.” 

“We prefer to call it diplomacy,” 
said Teddington-Wright. “What’s 
it to be. Sawyer? Twenty thousand 
pounds tax free, or bankruptcy?” 
“I need time to think about it.” 
Sawyer looked around wildly. 
“Sorry, Woulfe. I’ve had as much 
of this as I can take.” 

need to apologize,” said 
1^1 Woulfe, following him out 
of the room. “You merely con- 
firmed what I’d already told them. 
But I didn’t think they’d lean on 
you as hard as that.”

“They’re desperate to get Cassius 
back. But the whole proposal 
amazes me. I was partly responsible 
for her condition in the first place. 
How come she’s asking me for 
help?” 

“I see two possibilities, Martin. 
One: you may have touched some 
empathic chord in Doctor Cass that 
makes you the one person she’ll 
allow to trample around in her 
mind. Remember that in her pro- 
fession there are more than the 
usual number of things one may 
not want exposed.” 

“And the second possibility?” 
“Is that she may want you to 
enter her mind so she can punish 
you. Rationally or not, she still 
blames you for the circumstances 
that put her in my care.” 

“How ill is she?” 

“I don’t rate her as badly off as 
some seem to think — but there’s no 
doubt she’s seriously disturbed.” 
“May 1 see her?” 

“I wouldn’t advise it.” 

“Just for a minute?” 

“If you insist. But it’ll have to be 
under supervision. I wouldn’t put it 
past her to attack you on sight. 
You’ve been considerably on her 
mind.” 

Slightly apprehensive, Sawyer 
followed Woulfe to a part of the In- 
stitute where all the doors were 
locked. At a particular door two 
armed servicemen stood guard. 
Their function was more obviously 
to stop intruders than to prevent 
the escape of the occupant. They 



insisted on accompanying Woulfe 
and Sawyer into the room. 

The room itself was large and 
luxurious. It was as unlike a hos- 
pital room as any that Sawyer could 
have imagined. Rather, it resem- 
bled a drawing room of an aristo- 
cratic house. The broad, leaded 
windows looked out onto acres of 
well kept parkland and the antique 
perfection of the furnishings con- 
tained an inbuilt invitation torest 
and quietude. 

Inside the room was Cassius — 
the infamous Dr. Andrea Cass — 
whose expertise in the techniques of 
persuasion had made her the most 
sought-after practitioner of mind- 
rape and torture science — and 
probably the most feared and hated 
woman in the world. At this 
moment she was standing pensively 
at the window looking lost and very 
frail and feminine. Despite her re- 
lative youth Sawyer thought the 
gray streaks in her hair were more 
marked than he remembered. 

She turned as Sawyer entered 
and her smile of recognition was 
not without a trace of bitter humor. 

"Martin! It’s been a long time.” 

“Six months is all,” Sawyer said 
carefully. 

“That six months came directly 
out of my life.” Her voice held re- 
proach and she touched her face as 
she must have done a thousand 
times to reassure herself that the 
mirror was not lying. “I underesti- 
mated you, Martin. I won’t make 
that mistake another time.”

“There won’t be another time, 
Andrea. I don’t go for the kind of 
games you play.” 

“Then you won’t accept the chal- 
lenge?” Something of the old, 
bright tiger had awakened behind 
the curtains of her eyes. 

“What challenge?” 

“To see what life is like in the 
world of Andrea Cass. Access to the 
life model of the bitch of the 
century.” 

“It’s not my scene. I’ll wait till it 
comes out as a paperback.” 

“Whom are you afraid of, Mar- 
tin? Yourself or me?” 

“A good question. I’m afraid 
both for and of myself. I don’t give 
a damn about you.” 

“Yet you couldn’t resist coming 
here.” Her gaze was deep and pene- 
trating. “Shall I tell you why? You 
had to see if the legend was still as 
formidable as you remembered. 
You couldn’t resist the temptation 
of standing in the shadow of 
danger.” 

“You’re right, Andrea. You are 
the bitch of the century.” 

‘‘Perhaps of the millennium, 
Martin. Doesn’t that intrigue you? 
Hell I can read you like a book. 
You’ve a masochistic love of 
trouble. You don’t enjoy it, but 
you’re hooked on it. That’s why I 
know you’re going to make this 
jaunt.” 

“No. It’s the reason I’m not go- 
ing to make the jaunt. Knowing 
you has raised things in me I never 
knew existed. Given half a chance I 



might be tempted to finish the job I 
loused up last time. This time 
around I might kill you.” 

“Good. Then it’s settled. Half a 
chance is exactly what I’m offer- 
ing.” 

"I haven’t yet agreed to any- 
thing.” 

“Give me your hand, Martin.” 
The bright tiger behind her eyes 
.vas restless and alive. 

Unthinkingly he offered her his 
hand. She took it with fingers that 
were incredibly soft and cold. Then 
she moved more rapidly than his 
eyes could follow. He stood looking 
stupidly at the white weals across 
the veins of his wrist, just beginning 
to redden with beads of blood. 

W oulfe's intercession was 
swift. In the corridor outside 
he looked at the damage and 
grinned wryly. 

“We’d better get this dressed. 
All in all I think it’s less than you 
deserved. I told you 1 didn’t advise 
you to see her.” 

“You also advised me not to 
make the jaunt. I’m going to make 
it, though.” 

“I’ll have you certified first.” 
"That’s your privilege. I wouldn’t 
respond to blackmail. But I’m a 
sucker for a challenge.” 

"That’s what she’s playing on. 
She’s a clever woman. What she’s 
asking me to set up isn’t a therapy 
session — it’s war. And I don’t see 
you in the role of crusader.” 

"Look at it this way. Something 



WAR OF THE WASTELIFE 



137 




must have made Cassius the way 
she is. Here’s an opportunity to 
find out what.” 

“And when she eats you?” 

“She’ll try it anyway some day. I 
could see it in her eyes. If I'm going 
to have to face her I’d prefer to do it 
now rather than later.” 

Woulfe smiled ruefully and 
shook his head. “That’s probably 
the only rational thing you’ve said 
so far. This could be the first case 
in medicine where the prognosis 
was worse for the therapist than for 
the patient. You can’t have con- 
sidered what you’d be getting 
into.” 

“Cassius’s mind, would you be- 
lieve?” 

"Cassius’s world is a better de- 
scription. Take it from me it’s a 
bitter, violent territory. It contains 
cruelties and extremes your soft up- 
bringing has left you unequipped to 
face. Furthermore, it’s a place 
where she makes the rules and 
where the possibilities are limited 
only by her imagination. You don’t 
need me to remind you that mind- 
jaunt experiences can be every bit 
as painful as their real-life equiva- 
lents.” 

"That I accept. But with a little 
cooperation between us I can go in 
there with at least a fighting 
chance.” 

"You don’t stand any sort of 
chance. Compared to the type of 
mind to which you’ve been exposed, 
Cassius is an alien mentality. Why 
take the risk?” 



“Think about the lady for a mo- 
ment, Woulfe. You've probably 
suffered from her even more than I. 
Should we aim to cure the super- 
ficial trauma that brought her 
here — and have her go back to 
practicing her atrocities? Or do we 
take this opportunity to penetrate 
to the depths of her personality? 
Suppose I could get to the root of 
what makes her the particular sort 
of bitch she is?" 

Woulfe’s eyes widened with 
speculation. 

“She wouldn’t let you penetrate 
that deeply.” 

"It must be very lonely to be 
Cassius. Who’d ever offer a sympa- 
thetic ear to her private hurts and 
grievances? And what could be 
more comforting than actually to 
be able to show the wounds rather 
than merely to tell about them?” 

Woulfe's consideration ended in 
rejection. 

“The idea's tempting. But it’s 
too dangerous. It’s naive to think 
that her penchant for cruelty was 
induced by circumstance. It’s as 
likely to be innate. And that would 
leave you exactly where she wants 
you — as the object of a spiteful 
game.” 

"I’m going to be the object of 
that game some day. She’s not 
going to let me get away — so at 
least let me meet her under con- 
ditions where I can yell for an out 
when the going gets rough. Under 
other circumstances I might not get 
the option.” 



138

"Very well," Woulfe said finally. 
"I'll set it up. But I’ve the curious 
feeling she’s manipulating both of 
us. Are you going to take their 
money?” 

“Have it made payable to Am- 
nesty International. I don’t think 
the irony’ll be lost on No-name.” 



II 

«nr he principle of the mind- 
JL jaunt is fairly simple,” said 
Woulfe. "I wish I could say the 
same for the application. The on- 
line computer complex alone is 
probably the most powerful in the 
country.” 

No-name looked baffled. The 
size of the operation clearly amazed 
him. 

“Without getting technical, 
Woulfe, explain to me how you 
manage to get one person into an- 
other.” 

"Fortunately we don’t have to. In 
every person's brain there’s a per- 
ceptual model — a model of the 
world as the individual sees it. The 
information’s coded in the brain in 
a complex multi-access store. By 
finding another brain that uses a 
similar code we can explore the 
model as though it were a three- 
dimensional replica.” 

“Son of a bitch!” said No-name, 
rolling his eyes as if to look inside 
his own head. “So how do you get 
in? Through a hole?” 

"Nothing half so inexpensive. 



We use a modified EEG technique. 
In the brain is an entity called the 
cognicenter. This is a spark of con- 
sciousness that inhabits the model 
just as the individual inhabits the 
world at large. The cognicenter is a 
phase phenomenon — the mutual 
intercept point of seven different 
biological rhythms. The presence of 
the cognicenter causes the model 
itself to give off discharges we can 
reconstitute electronically to repro- 
duce the original mind scene.” 

"Hold it a minute, Woulfe. 
That’s all gobbledygook to me. The 
cognicenter sounds like a subver- 
sive organization that needs investi- 
gation by a Senate committee.” 

It was Woulfe’s turn to raise his 
eyes to the ceiling. He ignored the 
interruption. 

“In mind-jaunt therapy we don’t 
use the natural cognicenter at all. 
We create an artificial cognicenter 
by a pulse stimulation technique 
and track this through the model in 
response to the activities of our 
viewer equipped with a jaunt suit. 
While he actually walks in the jaunt 
theater or out on the field, his ex- 
periences are those of being present 
in the model.” 

“And that’s how' Sawyer’s going 
to get into Doctor Cass’s mind?” 

“She and Martin operate on the 
same wavelength, so to speak. He’ll 
take a jaunt into her mind and at- 
tempt to get to the location of the 
trauma that is causing her present 
distress. When he gets there he’ll 
have to repair the mind-wound 



WAR OF THE WASTELIFE 



139 




under my direction.” 

“And there’s no chance it’ll hurt 
her?” 

“It’s not her I’m worried about. 
In order to make the access pos- 
sible we have to present the full 
spectrum of sensations derived 
from the model: sight, sound, 
smell, touch, pain — the lot. Effec- 
tively, while Sawyer’s in Cass’s 
mind he’s an inhabitant of her 
inner world. Remembering what 
Doctor Cass stands for and the fact 
that she’s developed a deep-seated 
grudge against Sawyer, it’s quite 
likely she’ll trade the therapeutic 
benefits for the chance of revenge.” 
“Baloney.” 

“Is it, Mr. No-name? You’re a 
man with a free-ranging mind. It 
could be that you’re on Cass’s wave- 
length too. How’d you like to make 
Sawyer’s jaunt? How’d you like to 
be exposed to Cass’s imagination?” 
No-name stopped and searched 
his pockets for another cigar. He 
found one. As he lit it his eyes 
became fixed on the small, sharp 
gas-flame from the lighter. His 
hand began to tremble violently. 

“Son of a bitch!” he said fer- 
vently and, with a strained expres- 
sion on his face, went straight back 
to his car. 

W oulfe turned back to Saw- 
yer. “You haven’t yet seen 
our new mind-jaunt facility, have 
you, Martin? A bit of an improve- 
ment on the abandoned airstrip 
where we started. We’ve a small, 



covered jaunt theater for training 
and detail work and a two-mile 
square open course for major ex- 
ploratory work. Most of the elec- 
tronics is now plumbed in, so we’ve 
been able to bring the weight of the 
jaunt suits down a bit. We’re stick- 
ing to radio links, however, because 
of the mobility they allow.” 

“If 1 yell for out, just how long 
d’you reckon it’ll take to get me 
clear?” 

“There’s a snag here. The in- 
creased power of the new equip- 
ment forces us to be careful with 
the disconnection sequence. If 
we’re not you’ll get a sensory over- 
load that could knock you silly for 
days. We need a rundown time of 
about three minutes. Whatever you 
get into, give us at least that much 
notice.” 

“It doesn’t qualify as an emer- 
gency escape system.” 

“All the more need for you to be 
careful. I don’t know what Cass has 
up her sleeve, but I suspect she’s 
bribed one of the lab staff to brief 
her on operating procedure. She 
could know as much about the 
technical limitations as we do. So 
don’t cut your margins too fine.” 

“She could do a lot of damage in 
three minutes. What I really need is 
an instant exit.” 

“I’ve been thinking about that,” 
said Woulfe. “The best I can offer 
is a jump facility. This momentarily 
upsets the phases of the generators 
controlling the cognicenter point in 
the model. It produces an instan- 



140 



GALAXY 




taneous shift to another part of the 
model. Where you jump to is arbi- 
trary — and it won’t take her very 
long to find you. But it could buy 
some valuable time if she’s putting 
on the pressure.” 

They came now to the mind-jaunt 
theater. A trainee doctor was going 
through a simulated run in the 
jaunt suit. Strapped on the harness 
around his body were the sensors 
that defined his position in the 
theater, the transmitters that 
passed this information on to the 
computers, and the receivers that 
relayed the mind-jaunt information 
back to the equipment in the hel- 
met. As he moved around the 
theater the sights and sounds and 
impressions he was receiving from 
the helmet corresponded step for 
step with his apparent progress 
through the model. 

Sawyer closed his eyes and 
steadied himself. A dry run through 
the limitations of a computer simu- 
lation was one thing — a jaunt 
through the mind-wrenching and 
possibly painful realities of a living 
model was a thing different not 
only in degree but in kind. No com- 
puter model could reproduce the 
twists and subtleties, the sensations 
of presence and the dreadful inter- 
lock of personalities an actual 
mind-jaunt involved. 

The mind-jaunt helmet itself had 
evolved a lot since the last time he 
had worn one. It was lighter now, 
less cumbersome, and the head- 
straps had been replaced by Velcro 



strips. Unfortunately, for the sake 
of stability, a bearing yoke on the 
shoulders had padded bands that 
passed beneath the armpits — sound 
engineering, but a potential death 
trap to somebody who might need 
to get out of the helmet urgently 
and regardless of the disconnection 
risk. 

‘‘What do you think?” asked 
Woulfe. 

“I’m of two minds. Part of me 
says the value of the game isn’t 
commensurate with the risk. The 
other part asks why the hell I’m 
worried. After all, Cass is only a 
woman.” 

"Which notion could easily get 
you killed, Martin. Start thinking 
of her as only a woman and you’re 
dead. Better think in terms of hav- 
ing to sup with the devil and sharing 
the same spoon.” 

“Assuming for a moment that I 
manage to reach the seat of the 
trauma — what’s the procedure 
from there?” 

“You know what caused the con- 
dition, because you were an eye- 
witness. Under hypnosis I shall at- 
tempt to take her back to that 
point. If we can establish a replay 
all that’s necessary is for you to ar- 
range a different ending.” 

“Thinking about it,” said Saw- 
yer, “I’m not too convinced it’s 
necessary for me to go there at all. 
After all, her mind built the model. 
Why can’t it effect its own repairs?” 

“To a slight extent it does. We 
all at times go through our models 



WAR OF THE WASTELIFE 



141 




chipping off sharp corners to try to 
salve injured pride and prove we’re 
not as incompetent and insignifi- 
cant as reality suggests. It’s a pro- 
cess known as rationalization. But 
such repairs are largely superficial. 
The cognicenter needs outside rein- 
forcement if it’s to do a decent job. 
Otherwise the cracks remain.” 

“Is that what Cassius has done? 
Papered over the cracks in her 
mind with rationalization?” 

“I think her American doctors 
failed to appreciate that a mind- 
jaunt experience is at least equiva- 
lent to an actual experience. 
Cassius’s trauma resulted from a 
certainty that rats were eating her 
face — you were a witness. The 
Americans chose to regard the rats 
as the product of suggestion. But in 
her circumstances the rats were as 
real as any rats you’ll ever en- 
counter. I propose you stage a gal- 
lant rescue attempt — which will 
give her the opportunity to restruc- 
ture the model without the lesion.” 
“You’ve made my day!” said 
Sawyer. “That was all I needed — to 
be appointed official ratcatcher to 
the bitch of the century. Do I get a 
choice of weapons? If so. I’d like a 
flame-thrower. By the time I’m 
through, Cassius will really have 
something to be neurotic about.” 
Woulfe pursed his lips. “I appre- 
ciate the sentiment, Martin, but 
this is supposed to be a therapy 
session. The politics behind the 
situation are such that if any 
further harm comes to Cassius re- 



search into mind-jaunt will be 
written off for good. Which would 
be a pity. Mind-jaunt’s the first ap- 
proach to mental health that ever 
looked like becoming an exact 
science.” 

Ill 

C assius herself seemed uncon- 
cerned. In the small, copper- 
screened annex adjacent to the 
computer room she lay composedly 
on an operating table while elec- 
trodes were taped to her scalp. Her 
response to Sawyer was a curious 
half-reproachful look, which con- 
cealed a hint of triumph. Sawyer 
found this more daunting than a 
display of overt hostility. He feared 
suddenly that her tactics might be 
more subtle than the range of his 
available defenses. 

Then the technicians turned 
their attention to him. Once a pro- 
visional route through Cassius’s 
mind had been established it was 
planned that the therapeutic detail 
would be worked up in the covered 
jaunt theater. For the moment, 
however, Sawyer must work in the 
open on the two-mile field. The 
overcast sky threatened rain and 
presented no encouraging omen. 
Rather, it reflected his predomi- 
nant mood now that the bravado 
had flown and the ordeal was about 
to begin. 

With the technicians were six 
students, eager and anxious to 
assist and appearing faintly envious 



142 



GALAXY 




of his position. Remembering his 
own raw introduction to mind- 
jaunt, he thought their enthusiasm 
misplaced. To him the worlds en- 
countered under the helmet were 
places of violence, fear and mad- 
ness. The demands upon one’s 
understanding and personality were 
ferocious and absolute. He doubted 
if any of the bright youths around 
him would really have cared to take 
his place had they known the truth 
about the world he was going into. 
Despite Woulfe’s patient instruc- 
tion, no lectures could prepare a 
man for the actual experience. In 
the final analysis the only factor 
that would count was a grim deter- 
mination to survive. 

When the electrodes had been 
placed in contact with his scalp and 
the yoke and harness had been 
fitted the helmet was placed over 
his head. His immediate reaction 
was a claustrophobic fear. The 
headphones were silent and the pic- 
ture tubes were dark. Though he 
stood in the midst of his team, he 
was effectively isolated from them. 
He could feel fingers working on 
the straps and harness and the 
gradual addition of weight as the 
equipment packs were added, but 
these were now alien sensations. 
His reality was a silent, total dark- 
ness, a multi-dimensional blank 
slate on which a new and unfami- 
liar world was soon to be inscribed. 

Perhaps equally with Cassius’s 
antagonism, this new world itself 
was to be feared — in it the strong- 



man’s slope could become the 
cripple’s hill. 

It was a question of adjustment. 
His own cognicenter moved within 
its comfortingly familiar model 
which he had laid down over a life- 
time. Cassius’s background was a 
mystery. Yet now his senses were to 
enter her model, where even the 
basic precepts would seem alien 
and strange. He would have to 
grasp new concepts, interpret them 
and be able to handle himself 
within a new frame of reference. 
Such mental gymnastics were 
daunting enough when the model 
being entered was neutral. When 
the model was antagonistic — es- 
pecially the spiteful, frightful an- 
tagonism of Cassius — the prospect 
was sufficiently ominous to make 
him break out in a cold sweat. 

Woulfe would attempt to monitor 
his progress throughout the jaunt, 
but the monitors would reflect little 
of the immediacy or the involve- 
ment that were a feature of the 
jaunt itself. Further, while every 
step of the way he would be ac- 
companied by his group of assis- 
tants on the field, once he achieved 
breakthrough he would be subjec- 
tively very much on his own. Only 
the snug feel of the bulb of 
Woulfe’s emergency jump button 
strapped against his palm offered 
any sort of comfort. 

T he induction period was signal- 
ed by a staccato rushing noise 
in the headphones and a spectral 



WAR OF THE WASTELIFE 



143 




fireworks display on the picture 
tubes built into the helmet. The in- 
duction time was unusually long. 
Apparently Cassius’s brain was re- 
sisting the insertion of a foreign 
cognicenter. Several times the 
images nearly gelled only to be re- 
jected back into a formless chaos. 
Even under Woulfe’s mind-relaxing 
drugs her brain still presented a 
nearly impenetrable barrier to the 
mind-probe pulses, refusing to fall 
into syntonic harmony. 

Then came breakthrough. With 
a breathless quieting of the mush 
which had filled his senses, the 
scene suddenly crystallized and 
hardened. His first second of ex- 
posure left him shocked and 
amazed and fervently wishing he 
had not volunteered. He found 
himself standing in a garden, but 
this fact was secondary to the welter 
of impressions that assailed him. 
The clarity and fidelity of the scene 
was a study in sensory agony. He 
had not realized how dull and 
blunted his own senses had become 
until this instant when they had 
been bypassed and he had been fed 
the full-pitch version of the world 
as Cassius knew it. 

The incredible resolution of her 
vision was matched by a height- 
ening of tactile sensation, hearing, 
taste and smell. It was as though he 
had lived all his life in a thick shell 
that had suddenly been sloughed 
away. His brain was unused to re- 
ceiving the product of such naked 
sensitivity. It hurt. 



“Breakthrough?” Woulfe asked 
out of nowhere. 

“And how! You sure the damn 
thing’s adjusted right? Nobody 
could live at this pitch of sensi- 
tivity.” 

“Cassius does,” said Woulfe un- 
feelingly. “I warned you hers was al- 
most an alien mentality. She has a 
sensory hyperacuity that places her 
constantly closer to the threshold 
level. This perhaps explains her 
preoccupation with pain in other 
people.” 

"Can’t you turn it down?” Saw- 
yer asked. 

“No. The information’s not 
coded in analogue form. It would 
be a major computing exercise to 
attenuate it. In any case you’re go- 
ing to need to be keyed to the same 
pitch if you’re to match her on her 
own ground.” 

Sawyer shrugged resignedly and 
turned his attention back to his sur- 
roundings. Despite the improve- 
ment in equipment there was still a 
slight delay between his making a 
movement and the computer’s de- 
tecting it and matching it with an 
adjustment of the position of the 
artificial cognicenter in Cassius’s 
model. It was something to which 
he would quickly adjust and it was 
the only factor that detracted from 
his perfect sense of being present in 
the model. 

The first thing he noticed was 
that he was barefoot. Although he 
knew that in reality his feet were 
firmly encased in shoes, in 



144 



GALAXY 




Cassius’s model he could feel every 
individual blade of grass soft under 
his feet, and a pearling of dew that 
created a chill that was barely toler- 
able. The feeling was sensual and 
slightly illicit — a forbidden pleas- 
ure. 

R ising on a hill above a river, the 
.superb lawn on which he was 
standing formed a long, artistic 
crescent set at its narrowed top with 
rock arrangements hedged with 
bright flowers. It took him a few 
moments of wandering over the 
dew-soaked grass to realize that the 
lawn was actually shaped like a 
huge, broad-bladed scimitar, with 
the rocks and flowerbeds expertly 
interwoven to stimulate its jewel- 
encrusted hilt. The convex edge of 
the blade had incursions of crimson 
flowers representing life-blood still 
dripping from the edge. Thus a 
scene of great beauty was tainted by 
the morbid whim of a master 
gardener. There was something 
faintly insane and alien about the 
precise care that had been taken to 
produce so wry and bloodthirsty a 
joke. 

Sawyer started violently. Having 
thought himself alone, he was dis- 
turbed to find Cassius so close to 
him without warning. Instinctively 
he stepped back to put a prudent 
distance between them. 

His nervousness made her laugh. 
“A short truce, Martin. I want 
you to understand what you’ve got 
yourself into.” 



“I think you called it the mind- 
scene of the greatest bitch of the 
century.” 

“That was an understatement. 
The truth goes deeper.” 

Sawyer watched her curiously. 
He knew that in reality all that he 
was seeing was Cassius’s cogni- 
center — the point of heightened 
activity in the brain that caused the 
cells of the model to discharge, thus 
creating the condition of aware- 
ness. The mind, however, usually 
vested the cognicenter in an ideal- 
ized impression of the person’s own 
outward appearance, thus giving 
critical life to a psychological ab- 
stract. 

The Cassius before him was dif- 
ferent from the one he had known. 
She was younger, perhaps still in 
her late teens, and her dark hair 
was long and untroubled by streaks 
of gray. She was clad in a garment 
of white folded silk and her dress 
and manner made him notice for 
the first time a faintly oriental 
quality in her face. 

“How old is this memory, 
Andrea?” 

“We’re back ten years or so. 
There’s something I particularly 
want to show you here.” 

“Is it relevant to the therapy?” 
he asked. 

“No. But it’s relevant to what 
shaped a bitch like Andrea Cass.” 

She held out her hand. Sawyer 
pointedly ignored it. He was still 
looking at the long sweep of the 
scimitar lawn and trying to fathom

the twisted mentality behind it. She 
followed his gaze. 

“My ancestors laid that lawn a 
thousand years ago. Its location 
was carefully chosen. From the 
house at sunset you can actually see 
the blood draining from the blade 
into the river.” 

“What house?” 

“Up there on the hill. The House 
of Tsi. The place where I was 
born.” 

“1 thought you were European. 
This isn’t Europe.” 

“No, we’re in Asia now. Exactly 
where doesn’t matter. My mother 
was American. My father was Tsi — 
and the Tsi admit no national al- 
legiance. They have an unbroken 
tradition of their own going back a 
thousand years. It’s no ordinary 
family. Come! It’s important you 
understand.” 

Because of the incredible fidelity 
of the scene, it was easy for Sawyer 
to forget that both he and she were 
only cognicenters in the halls of 
Cassius’s mind. He followed her up 
a path of little steps that twisted 
and turned invitingly as they 
climbed the hill. His impression of 
her was probably her own idealized 
picture of herself as she had been at 
that age. Even allowing for some 
enhancement of the image, she 
must have been a creature of rare 
attraction. She moved with a lithe 
effortlessness, disconcertingly fe- 
line. He found a curious fascination 
in noting how exquisitely controlled 
was her every movement. 



H is own clumsy ascent caused 
him to feel more acutely the 
sharpness of the climb. He was glad 
when they reached the level bowl in 
the hillside in which the house was 
set. Here they encountered numer- 
ous transients — fleeting images of 
the hundreds of people and events 
occupying the model at this time- 
depth, yet whose relevance was in- 
sufficient to ensure a permanent 
place in the mind-scene. If he con- 
centrated carefully, he could follow 
them individually: a herdsman 
cursing recalcitrant goats; horse- 
men barebacked on wild mounts 
thundering down into the valley; a 
cart piled past the point of equili- 
brium, slowly tipping in a rut — idle 
snapshots of life that had caused a 
moment of attention and had then 
fallen into the limbo between re- 
membrance and forgetfulness. As 
soon as he ceased to watch them 
deliberately they dissolved to less 
than shadows. 

Some inhabitants of the model 
were more than transients, how- 
ever. These were the expected occu- 
pants of the scene. When it encoun- 
tered them a cognicenter could 
elicit a typical response, although 
the dialogue could not be sustained 
unless reinforced by suggestion or 
external perception. Thus two large 
dogs stood rigid before the gates, 
actually able to see and sense the 
arrival of the cognicenters, which 
were Cassius and himself. Cassius 
stopped between the dogs and 
spoke to them. The dogs greeted

Cassius eagerly, then, curiously, 
forgot her presence and wandered 
away as though she had ceased to 
exist. 

The house itself was a blend of 
many ages and many moods, 
faintly oriental yet seeming charac- 
teristic of no particular place or 
period. It was a large, white, ram- 
bling structure with many split 
levels where it ran against the hill. 
To the right of it, a second, lower 
group of buildings partly cloaked 
by trees, suggested the presence of 
stables and perhaps a household 
guard. 

As they entered the portal. 
Sawyer deliberately tested the ma- 
terial of the wall with his fingers, 
still vaguely refusing to believe that 
such seeming solidity was purely an 
electronic chimera and that every- 
thing he was experiencing was 
being drawn from the soft pulpi- 
ness of Cassius’s brain. His fingers 
encountered stone and plaster and 
cement indistinguishable from the 
fabric of any ordinary building. 

In the great, ornate hall of the 
house, servants were cleaning; their 
faintly mongoloid faces turning to 
Cassius with a respectful bow that 
trailed away uncompleted as they 
failed to maintain perception of the 
ghosts who walked among them. 
Cassius passed them all without ac- 
knowledgement and mounted the 
stairs, signaling for Sawyer to 
follow. She entered a suite of rooms 
on the first floor. Here, in a chair of 
woven cane, sat a little brown man 



so advanced in years that Sawyer 
could happily have believed that he 
was the oldest man alive, 

"Chu Tsi,” said Cassius in a 
voice slightly hushed with awe. 
“Master of the present House of Tsi 
and perhaps the most terrible of 
them all. His forefathers were the 
makers of warrior kings, but Chu 
Tsi is a maker of legends.” 

“I don’t understand that.” 

“For centuries the sons of Tsi 
have been taken from their mothers 
at the age of five to be trained as 
warriors. The training is brutal and 
extreme, but completely effective. 
By the age of seven the Tsi child 
can ride, hunt, shoot, fish and live 
off the land where occasion de- 
mands. At eight, he’s toughened by 
being put through the rigors of ex- 
tremes of heat and cold and depriv- 
ation. He has to live for days with- 
out food or sleep and swim rivers 
with his arms tied behind his back. 
He has to learn such iron discipline 
that he will walk barefoot into fire 
if ordered to do so.” 

“The Stoics never had it so 
good,” said Sawyer. 

“At nine, he’s trained to kill with 
every kind of weapon and with his 
hands. As a guarantee of his pro- 
ficiency, and to ensure proper 
sleeping habits, two assassins are 
hired to kill him. Not only must he 
withstand them, but he must kill 
them both and cut from each the 
heart and liver and eat these 
publicly to prove that there’s 
nothing within or without him of 



WAR OF THE WASTELIFE 



147 




which he’s afraid. After he has 
proved he’s worth the trouble his 
education begins. It lacks nothing 
from any Western standpoint.” 

“So what makes Chu so special?” 
“Oh, Chu’s a man of the 
twentieth century. The abacus is re- 
placed by the computer. Not for 
him the women in purdah and the 
female infants put to death. On 
Chu’s decision, the daughters are 
now trained as warriors equally 
with the sons.” 

“Is that what they did to you?” 
“Yes.” There was pain and a 
great weariness in her eyes. “I was 
trained as a Tsi warrior. I’d killed 
five men by the age of ten, and 
there was nothing I didn’t know 
about exhaustion and suffering. 
Chu is exquisitely fair — he makes 
no concessions of any sort because 
of a warrior’s sex. 

“Woman’s lib carried to its logi- 
cal conclusion?” 

“Whatever hell he made of child- 
hood, I have to admit his policy was 
justified. No matter in what pro- 
fession they’ve engaged, famous or 
infamous, the children of Tsi have 
all become legends in their own life- 
times. The Tsi kingmakers have 
lost none of their dominance. 
They’ve merely widened their 
sphere of influence.” 

“Why did I need to know this?” 
“Because I want you to know 
what you’re up against. I don’t 
want you to fall too soon, Martin. It 
would spoil my enjoyment of the 
game.” 



T he old man in the cane chair 
stirred and opened his eyes — 
eyes that even at his extreme age 
were as bright and penetrating as 
those of Cassius. His gaze lingered 
on Sawyer for longer than an in- 
habitant of the model was supposed 
to be able to sustain attention. The 
fact raised a prickling sensation on 
Sawyer’s neck. His tidy set of mind- 
jaunt principles became not quite 
the absolutes he had thought them. 
Inexplicably in the old man’s eyes 
he read a clear sign of recognition. 

Chu Tsi turned to Cassius and 
spoke a few words in a language 
Sawyer could not understand. The 
phrase seemed to surprise her and 
she countered with a sharp inter- 
rogation. Chu answered softly but 
firmly and waved his hand as 
though the matter were not open 
for discussion. Cassius made a sign 
of obeisance, but it was obvious 
that the interview had not gone as 
she had planned. Finally the old 
man lapsed back into unawareness. 

“What was all that about?” 
asked Sawyer. 

She was looking at him specula- 
tively, a frown of puzzlement on her 
brow. “Something I hadn’t antici- 
pated, Martin. But it’s not impor- 
tant. It’s just that he told me some- 
thing about you.” 

“He knew me?” asked Sawyer, 
perplexed. 

“That’s correct, Martin. He 
knew who you are and why you’re 
here. He’d asked to see you.” 
“That’s ridiculous. He’s part of 



148 



GALAXY 




your model — a fragment of your 
memory.” 

“That’s only a partial truth. The 
idea of models in the mind is not 
new. The Tsi have known of them 
for centuries. Admittedly we didn’t 
have Woulfe’s mind-jaunt access, 
but that didn’t prevent the Tsi from 
exploring. And that’s where you’ve 
already made your first mistake.” 
“How do you mean?” 

“I mean I’ve got you exactly 
where I want you. Not even that old 
fool Woulfe knew how much con- 
trol I have over this model. I’m 
going to take my revenge on you, 
Martin. I’m going to punish you 
tenfold for what I suffered — and 
then go on from there.” 

“You’re insane, Andrea.” 

‘‘If you think that, Martin, 
you’ve understood nothing I’ve told 
you about myself or the Tsi. I doubt 
you’re that stupid. But either way, 
the truce is ended. You’ve five 
minutes to prepare. Then the war 
begins.” 

She turned away and left him in 
the room. The little brown man in 
the chair still sat deeply in thought, 
as though trying to remember 
something that had slipped his 
memory. Though his eyes roved 
several times in Sawyer’s direction, 
there was no evidence that he was 
still aware of the physicist’s stand- 
ing only meters from him. 






W OULFE?” 

“Yes, Martin?” The psy- 



chiatrist answered out of nowhere. 



“Are you monitoring this se- 
quence? How much of it is 
factual?” 

“Almost all of it, I’d say. There’s 
no evidence so far that Cassius is 
distorting the model. What's the 
problem?” 

“Chu Tsi. He recognized me. I’m 
sure of it. But this memory’s ten 
years old — and I’ve never met him. 
How come an inhabitant of 
Cassius’s model seems to have a life 
of his own?” 

“There’s no answer to that — ex- 
cept to affirm it’s impossible. But I 
hadn’t realized the Tsi had a 
knowledge of mind-scenes. Cassius 
could be more adept at controlling 
the model than we’ve allowed. 
Want to be pulled out while we 
think about it?” 

“No — let it run. We’ll learn a lot 
quicker that way.” 

“I’ve learned a lot already. She 
wants to punish you, but there’s an- 
other idea behind that one that has 
to do with the Tsi. I don’t know 
enough of the language to be able 
to follow all the conversation, but 
the phrase Chu used to her trans- 
lates as ‘worthy choice.’ Whether 
worthy friend or worthy enemy 
wasn’t stated.” 

“I don’t get the implication,” he 
replied. 

“Nor do I. But be doubly careful, 
Martin. She’s playing a deeper 
game than we imagined.” 

Finally Sawyer came to the 
opinion that Cassius was not going 
to return. She had given him five 



WAR OF THE WASTELIFE 



149 




minutes to prepare. Seven minutes 
had elapsed and nothing had 
happened. Such a hiatus was 
curious. Becoming increasingly 
wary, he started to explore. 

The servants cleaning the hall 
met him with a startled surprise 
that immediately trailed into for- 
getfulness. He walked around 
them, knowing that to the touch 
they were indistinguishable from 
real people, yet continued com- 
munication between him and them 
was impossible. They were inhabi- 
tants of Cassius’s model and be- 
longed to a place and a time of 
which he had no part. 

The front door was closed and he 
approached it cautiously. The por- 
tal suggested itself as an ideal place 
for a trap. Opening the door re- 
vealed nothing to justify his sus- 
picions. He stood for many seconds 
studying the slope of the hill and 
wondering what might be concealed 
in the dead ground beyond the edge 
of the bowl. Then he stepped 
through the doorway and the 
instant change of light and scene 
told him exactly what sort of trick 
Cassius had prepared for him. 

S he had somehow rearranged 
the model so that as he crossed 
the threshold he moved not into an 
adjacent mind-scene but into one 
removed in time and place from the 
scene where he had been. Suddenly 
he was back in London in the 
model of a dingy street — the scene 



of the incident that had been the 
cause of Cassius’s breakdown. He 
should have been brought to this 
point later, when Cassius had been 
returned here under the influence 
of Woulfe’s hypnosis. Instead she 
had recreated the scene herself. 

She had not made a very good 
job of it. Whole areas, for which 
Sawyer could remember the details, 
were merely blocked grays and 
blacks in Dr. Cass’s model. The 
windows were featureless. The 
walls trailed into a vague fusion a 
few meters above his head and the 
roads leading to the area were ill- 
perceived backdrops without any 
actual existence. Only Cassius her- 
self was more carefully drawn. She 
stood against the wall exactly as he 
remembered, now the maturer 
woman he knew, with the gray 
streaks in her hair and a mocking 
venom in her eyes. 

“Yes, Martin?” She was about 
ten meters distant and the whole 
scene was hushed and hollow, as 
though it were taking place inside a 
teacup. “You recognize this scene. 
It’s where you once let me be eaten 
by the rats. You’d have killed me 
that day if you hadn’t made a mis- 
take.” 

“I don’t deny it. But there are no 
rats here now.” 

“They’re here, Martin. They al- 
ways will be. But I’ve learned to 
come to terms with them. I’ve 
papered over the memory — to bor- 
row one of Woulfe’s favorite ex- 
pressions.” 



150

“Then you didn’t really need me 
here at all.” 

“It was naive of Woulfe to think 
he could recreate the conditions of 
the trauma and give it a different 
ending. I needed you here for two 
quite different reasons. I want 
something from you that you won’t 
be prepared to give. And I want 
revenge.” 

From the corners of his eyes 
Sawyer thought he detected the sur- 
face of the road twitching. He 
saw — or imagined — a random 
movement that tended to vanish 
when he looked at it directly. The 
effect bothered him, but he could 
not explain it. It was related to the 
movement of transients, but there 
were no transients in this part of 
Cassius’s model. She had not ob- 
served the scene when anyone other 
than himself had been present. The 
only thing missing from the scene 
was a horde of carnivorous . 

RATS 

The mystery was explained. 
Scarcely beneath the depth of Saw- 
yer’s perception the horrifying 
throng of rodents still fermented. 
Whether Cassius was rescanning 
the model to a lower level, or 
whether the rats were permanently 
close to breaking back into the 
scene, was not important. The criti- 
cal thing was that they appeared to 
be slowly surfacing. He could al- 
ready hear their squeaking and 
scuffling and smell their incredibly 
foul stench. 

Cassius was aware of their emer- 



gence and watched their progress 
with a fixity that suggested there 
was some critical value to which she 
would let the phenomenon develop 
before she intervened. 

Sawyer stood with a new under- 
standing of what the scene meant to 
her. What he had not before appre- 
ciated was the effect of Cassius’s 
heightened sensitivity. Although he 
was familiar with the scene, he was 
now viewing it through her inter- 
pretation and the sheer force of her 
dread surged up in waves that en- 
gulfed his senses. 

The stench became physically in- 
tolerable. It hit him with a nausea 
that left him weak on his feet. The 
rodents’ snarling, squealing voices 
spoke — each with a separate, dis- 
tinguishable tone. The blood lust 
was apparent in their eyes and in 
the movement of their quick, in- 
cisive jaws. Here was horror multi- 
plied by the fidelity of its repro- 
duction. These were the creatures 
who had encircled Cassius and 
leaped upon her and begun to feast 
upon the flesh of her hands and 
face. These were the creatures . 

Sawyer grew worried. The scene 
was fully formed now. The crea- 
tures were in every sense alive and 
dangerous. Although the mind- 
scene remained, Cassius was sud- 
denly gone. He found himself alone 
in the grotesque cavern of memory 
with hundreds upon hundreds of 
ravenous flesh-eating rats whose 
original target had withdrawn. 

His own mobility was limited by 



WAR OF THE WASTELIFE 



151 




the fact that Cassius had only an 
imperfect knowledge of the original 
place from which the scene was 
drawn. It was a curious sensation, 
knowing that one was in the ana- 
logue of a place one knew, yet find- 
ing familiar means of access were 
now only symbols instead of thor- 
oughfares. Of such material were 
nightmares made. 

The rats had become restless up- 
on the withdrawal of Cassius. Many 
of them had already investigated in 
Sawyer’s direction and now their 
interest grew. One leaped bodily 
onto his arm and plunged up the 
outside of his sleeve. As it reached 
his shoulder, he struck out in 
panic. For an instant the creature 
clung to his hand, claws gripping 
and teeth snapping viciously. With 
an urgent swing of his wrist he 
managed to shake it off, but not be- 
fore it had bitten deeply into his 
little finger. 

He knew then what to expect. 
Having tasted blood, the rat rallied 
from where it had fallen and hurled 
itself back to the attack. Others 
who had been undecided found this 
the encouragement they needed. In 
a living, carnivorous carpet, the 
whole mass of them moved towards 
Sawyer, anxious for the kill. 

Having examined his finger, he 
was in no doubt of the damage even 
one rat could do. The fact that the 
vermin existed only in Cassius’s 
mind was irrelevant. As an occu- 
pant of her world their existence for 
him was indisputable. There was 



no place to which he could run and 
he had no weapons he could use for 
his defense. His only hope of escape 
was to use the yet untried jump de- 
vice, the bulb of which he could feel 
against his wrist. With turned 
fingers he found he could just reach 
the actuator. As the horrifying tide 
of vermin reached his shoes he 
pressed the button. 

Fortunately it worked. 

V 

H e found himself transferred 
instantaneously to a curiously 
forbidding place and an air of cold 
unreality clawed at his whole being. 
The new scene was alien and 
strange, as though the model were 
drawn from a world that had ever 
existed. The sky was not sky at all 
but an expanse of interminable twi- 
light. It had no features except at 
one point where the white haze 
turned back a fiery glow, as though 
reflecting the presence of some 
demoniac furnace. Even the light 
had a peculiar quality, with no dif- 
fusion or scattering of illumination 
to the underside of leaves or 
grasses, producing an all-or-noth- 
ing surrealistic effect of muted 
tones and colors fringed with unex- 
pected shade. 

He was on a forlorn heathland 
covered with sparse, undernour- 
ished grass and warped and stunted 
shrubs. It was a wasteland that only 
grudgingly permitted the existence 
of life, then mocked it as it grew.

“Woulfe, where the devil am I?” 
“I was wondering the same 
thing. The jump overreached and 
took your cognicenter out of the 
model proper. What we’re reading 
now is something out of the deep 
brain.” 

“It reads like a model.” 
“Emotions have to be formalized 
somehow. It could just be that the 
deep brain also uses analogue 
models. But don’t take what you 
see too literally. At this mind depth 
you’re reading emotion and in- 
stinct, not structural memory.” 
“Unforgiving and brutal is about 
the most charitable description I 
can offer. If that’s a sample of the 
emotion our worst fears are con- 
firmed. The whole place shrieks 
with a resentment of life.” 

“I warned you Cassius’s cruelty 
was likely to be innate. This rather 
proves the point. Still think you can 
plough good soil from a granite 
hillside?” 

“At least I’d like to look around 
a bit. I can see something in the 
valley over there that might be in- 
teresting.” 

‘‘You’re the eternal optimist, 
Martin. But you’re on hallowed 
ground where Cassius is concerned. 
If she catches you probing this deep 
she’ll unleash all hell to stop you.” 
The way down to the valley was a 
recessed and twisted track of large 
brown stones set in cracked, incle- 
ment clay. It could once have been 
the bed of a river, except that water 
here would have been out of char- 



acter — though it might have nur- 
tured some of the tortured flora on 
the banks. As he rounded a bend 
Sawyer found himself on the out- 
skirts of a broken township, which 
occupied the valley. Massive dis- 
aster rather than time seemed to 
have been the agent that had torn 
the scene apart. Before him was 
desolation without parallel. 

He was right in his surmise that 
the road might once have been a 
watercourse. Soon he found himself 
below a broken bridge — a ruined 
watermill hung its appendages use- 
lessly askew over this place where 
no more water ran. Above the 
bank, depression drifted like a 
mist, draining out of the gray and 
twisted shells of the houses and 
shops and syphoning down the 
broken assemblage of a wharf. 

Wonderingly he climbed to 
higher ground. Whatever disaster 
had killed the town, its finality 
had been absolute. No life stirred 
around the broken walls, nor was 
there any sign of clearance or re- 
building. The inhabitants who once 
had lived here must have long 
abandoned hope and either fled or 
given up all thoughts of reclama- 
tion. 

as he moved through the broken 
rV streets he could see that one 
solitary building stood intact high 
on the hillside. This was a white, 
domed temple standing impressive 
and unscathed, as if untouched by 
the furies that had crushed the 



WAR OF THE WASTELIFE 



153 




town. Here was a monument of 
triumph in the midst of desolation. 
In fact, so broadly stated was its 
triumph that he began to wonder if 
it had not also a measure of respon- 
sibility for the damage to the town- 
ship around it. 

He became interested in what 
sort of people could have lived here 
and what had been the nature of 
the disaster that had struck them. 
Where the damage was less than 
total he began to pry into broken 
ruins and press warily along dark, 
ruined hallways. The results of his 
investigation left him with a pe- 
culiar feeling. He saw no evidence 
of furnishings or interior decora- 
tion and nothing to suggest that 
any of the houses had ever been oc- 
cupied or even completed. It was as 
though the whole scene had been 
constructed deliberately as ruins. 
The purpose of this gross and gi- 
gantic film-set was lost on him until 
he emerged back into the streets 
and saw the white, unblemished 
temple sitting in serene arrogance 
above him on the hill. 

“For the greater glory of 
Cassius,’’ said Woulfe’s disem- 
bodied voice. “Who would have 
thought she was still a virgin?” 

“What are you reading, 
Woulfe?” 

“The symbolism, Martin. Un- 
sullied purity set in a high place 
amid a sea of degradation.” 

“To heck with symbolism that’s 
moulded of bricks and marble. 
What happens if I go up there and 



write obscenities on the wall?” 

“I suspect you’d never make it. 
But the idea does have appeal. 
You’ll be the first independent en- 
tity to have entered the territory — 
other than Cassius herself. But God 
help you when she catches up!” 
“What’s she doing now?” 
“Hunting pretty wildly through 
the model looking for you. Like my- 
self, she’d no idea you could get 
into her as deep as you’ve managed. 
But it’s only a question of time 
before she finds you.” 

“I’m going up to the temple. I 
want to find out what sort of deity 
she imagines herself to be.” 

The road up the hill was weird. It 
was paved with granite blocks worn 
smooth as though it had once been 
a much used thoroughfare. Little 
gray houses flanking the way had 
been crushed from above, as if 
swiped by a godlike hand which 
had objected to their obscuring the 
view of the white edifice on the hill. 
The road was also strewn with 
rubble and timbers which there had 
been no obvious attempt to clear. 
But a narrow, winding pathway led 
around and past the piles of debris, 
as though spmeone still came to or 
from the temple. It was not clear as 
to whether pilgrims visited or 
whether the goddess herself came 
frequently to gloat over the totality 
of her powers of destruction. 

As he approached the temple his 
objective eye found the scene even 
more curious. The monstrous plinth 
on which the place was built had 



154 



GALAXY 




literally been set down on the older 
fabric of the town and sat untidily 
on top of the crushed rubble. It was 
obviously a concept rather than a 
structure, and certainly it had not 
been sited by an engineer. The 
broad gap under the plinth, from 
which broken fragments of the 
older houses still showed, suggested 
an impatience and a petulance 
about its placing. Yet Sawyer 
judged the weight of the edifice to 
be about right for the degree to 
which it had compacted the rubble 
underneath. It seemed that even in 
the depths of Cassius’s mind the 
principles of physics still main- 
tained some sort of discipline. 

Climbing the high edge of the 
plinth took a great deal of physical 
effort, but finally he managed it. 
From there on it was an easy matter 
to ascend the great marble steps 
and enter the building itself. Every- 
thing from floor to ceiling was of 
the same white marble and the ar- 
tistry that had gone into the struc- 
ture’s design was unique and mar- 
velous. The dismaying thing was 
that it was empty, a series of halls 
and corridors completely without 
function, furniture, decoration or 
any feature of interest. The ambi- 
tion and imagination that seemed 
to have been expended in its con- 
ception had failed to a cold noth- 
ingness when given the task of 
elaborating the interior. 

Intrigued, Sawyer toured all the 
major areas, feeling rather like a 
mouse in a series of cardboard 



boxes. If Cassius were a goddess 
here, her faith was a hollow and 
sterile thing. He went out by the 
way he had come and jumped back 
into the rubble surrounding the 
temple, searching for something 
with which to defile the pointless 
perfection of the structure. 

He returned with a handful of 
charred wood that made a healthy 
if ill-defined mark. With this he 
went around the edifice inscribing 
on the walls large and obvious 
phallic graffiti. Then he dropped 
again from the plinth, chuckling 
hugely to himself. He was not prone 
to issuing graffiti, but this was a 
measured gesture of defiance and 
rebuke that had a more than 
common point. Besides which, it 
improved his spirits remarkably. 

D espite Woulfe’s prediction, 
Nemesis in the form of Cassius 
had still not descended upon him. 
He welcomed the continued oppor- 
tunity to explore the strange scene, 
because here the symbols were un- 
selfconscious and unguarded and 
represented a basic honesty that 
would not necessarily be found in 
the higher parts of the model which 
Cassius could manipulate. 

A red glow in the sky caught his 
attention and he picked his way 
carefully along the little path 
through the ruins toward the origin 
of the strange redness. 

From occasional mutterings 
through the headphones he was 
aware that the psychiatrist was

following his progress on the 
monitors. Then he heard a grunt as 
though of comprehension as the 
bright flame in some fiery pit be- 
came apparent across the shattered 
landscape. 

“You on to something, Woulfe?” 

“We just made history, Martin. 
The symbolic confirmation of the 
great Freudian precept — the 
human Id.” 

Sawyer looked toward the embryo 
volcano with new respect. The fe- 
rocity of its subterranean fires be- 
came more impressive the closer he 
approached. Even from his present 
distance he could feel the ground 
vibrating slightly in response to its 
deep-throated roar. Jets of flame 
reared and thundered about the 
open rim, speaking of fantastic 
pressures and internal tempera- 
tures of thousands of degrees. 

“Look at it, Martin!” Woulfe 
sounded ecstatic. “The source point 
of the will to live. A blast of emo- 
tions so raw and powerful that 
sometimes even the mind’s filters 
can’t contain it. There’s savagery 
and madness and love and hate all 
in one hectic mixture. From it we 
have the temerity to try to distill 
the thin gruel we call civilized be- 
havior. No wonder we’re not very 
good at it. Even a saint must derive 
his inspiration from a very personal 
hell.” 

“Could this be the original of the 
hell-fire mythology?” asked Saw- 
yer. “Has somebody been here and 
seen this before?” 



“We know the Tsi have been ex- 
ploring the mind — as have many 
mystics. I suspect that some drugs 
and toxic confusion states also give 
at least partial access to these 
regions. I think a few people may 
have had glimpses, but I doubt if 
anyone ever achieved your con- 
tinuity of access.” 

Sawyer had stopped listening. 
His attention was concentrated on a 
low ridge that lay between himself 
and the Id pit. For a moment he 
thought he saw a silhouette moving 
against the skyline, illuminated by 
the brilliance beyond. He froze in- 
stantly, fearing that some new 
fiends conjured by Cassius might 
be waiting for him ahead. When he 
looked again the movement was 
gone, but he remained with the 
firm conviction that something was 
certainly alive among the ruins 
around the pit. 

“Trouble?” asked Woulfe. 

“I’ve got visitors.” 

“There have been no signs of life 
this far — at least registering here.” 
‘‘Well, something moved. Is 
Cassius still occupied?” 

“She’s still hunting, but she 
hasn’t yet gotten down to your 
level.” 

“Could be there’re inhabitants 
here.” 

“A fascinating proposition. In- 
habitants in the deep mind could 
only have a symbolic role.” 

“Want me to check it out?” he 
asked. 

“It's your show, Martin. You’re 



156 



GALAXY 




the one taking the risks.” 

W arily Sawyer moved forward, 
keeping low against the piles 
of rubble and broken walls. He was 
nearly to the ridge before he saw 
the party in front of him crossing 
the skyline against the now-brilliant 
haze of fire. A man and a woman, 
hand in hand and completely 
naked, were walking steadfastly 
toward the pit. Immediately behind 
them came a second couple. All 
four were clean-limbed, straight 
and youthful — archetypes of the 
perfection of physical form. 

Keeping out of sight, Sawyer 
followed them over the ridge. He 
need not have worried about con- 
cealment, however, because the 
couples had eyes for nothing but 
the terrible pit they were approach- 
ing. They went on as if some blind 
compulsion ordered them toward 
the flames. Sawyer was about a 
hundred meters behind them at 
this point and they were halfway 
between him and the hell-pit, but 
even from his position the ground 
was sensibly warm and the radiant 
heat from the flames was hot upon 
his face. It needed no calculation to 
appreciate that the party in front of 
him was already in a region of 
severe physical discomfort and 
would soon reach a point past 
which human endurance would 
fail. 

Fascinated, he stopped and 
watched their progress. It must 
have been true that they felt the 



heat, suffered from it, were agon- 
ized and finally crippled by it — but 
nothing halted their progress. For 
the }ast ten meters of the way they 
were literally crawling over the red- 
hot rim, and such was the realism 
of the scene that Sawyer could 
smell the sickening stench of burn- 
ing flesh, acrid in his nostrils. If 
there was anything further to note 
it was the way in which, even in the 
depths of agony, the lovers still held 
hands as they toppled, charred and 
burning, into the pit. 

“Is that what you wanted to see, 
Woulfe? Me — I feel sick.” 

“More than I wanted to see, 
Martin. Cassius is also a fanatical 
puritan.” 

“How do you make that out?” 

“These couples come down hand 
in hand from the temple through 
desolation into hell. You can see 
the path is deeply worn. To her this 
downward progress is an eternally 
continuing deal. And the conse- 
quences are, of course, unalter- 
able.” 

“You can make symbolism read 
any way you want,” said Sawyer, 
unconvinced. “Like leaves in a tea- 
cup. You’re as likely to be reading 
your own prejudices as reading the 
symbol.” 

“Do you have another explana- 
tion?” 

Sheer bloody-mindedness. She 
just likes watching people suffer.” 

“You’re confusing cause and 
effect. She’s punishing those over 
whom she has control as a token for 



WAR OF THE WASTELIFE 



157 




a whole world that offends her 
moral ethic.” 

“I still think she’s just a vicious 
bitch.” 

‘‘We’re both saying the same 
thing. The whole point is that what 
she’s doing here is fundamental to 
her nature. Hopes of reclaiming 
Cassius are out.” 

S awyer looked back toward the 
temple standing arrogant on the 
ruined hill. Cassius’s psyche was a 
wasteland where the ancient schism 
between good and evil was continu- 
ally played out as an atrocious 
drama. Even now he could see an- 
other pair of couples threading 
their way through the ruins, intent 
on giving themselves as sacrifice to 
the awful fires of Cassius’s drive. 
There ought, he reflected, to be a 
comparable term to wasteland — 
something called wastelife — to en- 
compass the despoliation of man- 
kind. 

‘‘Trouble,” Woulfe said sudden- 
ly. “Cassius is digging deeper. I 
think she suspects where you are.” 
Sawyer felt for the bulb of the 
jump button and adjusted it to 
within easy reach. 

“How much control would she 
have at this mind depth?” 

“Martin, you’re at a very primi- 
tive level. At that depth — hell, she’s 
the Creator!” 

Sawyer released the jump bulb 
and stood waiting, watching with 
wry amusement as the white, fea- 
tureless cardboard of the sky 



darkened with a growing storm. 
The whole atmosphere became 
tense and expectant — taut, as with 
the winding of some cosmic main- 
spring. The tension rose to the 
point of crisis and continued until 
he wondered how much more it 
could climb before something 
snapped — and exactly what would 
happen when it did. 

“Martin!” 

Cassius’s voice was full of fury. It 
rolled across the scene like the 
sound of some great catastrophe. 
Sawyer swung around to find her 
only meters away and not fully 
formed optically. Her cognicenter 
refused to come to a coherent 
image, but hovered as a white dif- 
fusion that somehow more aptly 
described her anger. 

“You’re not supposed to be 
here!” 

He detected undertones of shock 
and panic in her voice. 

“Some fool must have loused up 
the itinerary,” he said. 

A black thunderbolt from no- 
where shattered the ground beside 
him with such force that bricks and 
stones were crushed and the frag- 
ments grazed him as they passed. 

“I could kill you for this — except 
that killing would be too quick an 
end — too mild — less than you de- 
serve.” 

Her anger caused deep rever- 
berations in the ground, like sub- 
terranean thunder. Parts of the 
ruins around Sawyer slipped and 
fell. 



158 



GALAXY 




“You gave me half a chance, 
Andrea. You wouldn’t expect me to 
waste the opportunity.” His voice 
maintained a reasonable calm. 

Another thunderbolt burst be- 
side him. Hurtling fragments tore 
at his legs and bruised his back. 
Overhead a great storm gripped the 
terrain with black pincers, while 
the thunder began to shake it per- 
ceptibly. 

“Waste what opportunity? What 
have you done?” 

Panic edged her voice and the 
scene literally shook with emotion. 
Many of the ruins split and were 
leveled, leaving the temple almost 
naked on the hill. The little path 
itself was completely obscured. 
Whatever the final results of the 
jaunt, Cassius’s deep-mind model 
was never going to have quite the 
same aspect. 

“Look at your temple, Andrea. 
See what I’ve done.” 

For a moment the white, un- 
focused cognicenter hovered with 
agitation, as if uncertain whether 
or not to leave him. Then like a 
fleeting trace of smoke it fled 
straight across the wasteland to the 
temple. Scarcely had it reached 
there when one great cry of 
anguished disbelief screamed 
across the artificial heavens. 

“Defiled!” 



T he storm broke. A mighty wind 
rose like a tornado from around 
the edges of the pit and screamed a 



singeing breath across the shattered 
scene. A cloud burst overhead and 
glass-hard hailstones beat the 
ground in cold fury and rebounded 
shoulder high from the startled 
granite. 

Sawyer pressed himself against 
the remnants of a wall where an 
architrave gave him a little protec- 
tion for his head. Thunder crashed 
and roared above and the ground 
itself began to heave and writhe 
and shake to pieces the scant pro- 
tection he had contrived. The whole 
scene rose to the pitch of dark 
crescendo, an unbelievable anger 
that now shook him bodily and 
lashed and swirled and struck at 
him with all the physical forces at 
its disposal. 

With the jump bulb security in 
his hand, he took the punishment 
with fortitude, curious to know how 
much greater were the forces Dr. 
Cass had at her command. Such 
was the fury of the storm that the 
whereabouts of Cassius’s cognicen- 
ter could not be determined. The 
violent lightning that raked the 
ersatz sky showed the temple main- 
taining its arrogance on the hill. 
The pit was displaying its own 
brand of anger. A strong surge of 
pressures below the surface belched 
masses of leaping incandescence 
high into the air and the vibration 
of its raging added to the inconceiv- 
able scream of the thunder. 

He wondered if the violence were 
inexhaustible — or whether it must 
falter and be followed by a period 



WAR OF THE WASTELIFE 



159 




of relaxation. Fantastically, how- 
ever, the phenomena continued to 
climb to an even higher key, and 
such was the pitch of the maelstrom 
now, that the impression flooded 
together and became one continu- 
ing barrage of noise, light and 
pressure from which the individual 
impressions could not be sorted 
out. 

Sawyer felt his senses being 
swamped and knew that his physi- 
cal danger had already reached ac- 
ceptable limits. He therefore found 
the actuator on the jump bulb and 
pressed. In the instant that he did 
so, the white lace of a truly amazing 
lightning pulse lit the whole scene 
more clearly than he had seen it be- 
fore. The marble temple threw the 
light back furiously across the sub- 
dued and terrified wastes. As he 
saw the scene, laughter rose to his 
iips and his exit was marked by a 
fantastic, mocking echo. For in 
that last moment he saw the awe- 
some truth — Cassius’s temple had 
split in two. 



VI 

4 4 a breaction’s one thing,” 
x\.said Woulfe plaintively. 
“But that was an effect of quite a 
different order.” 

Sawyer’s jump had terminated in 
what appeared to be a prison cell. 
A high, barred window admitted a 
minimum of daylight and the 
strong steel door had a shuttered 



grille through which the sound of 
steel-tipped boots echoed from a 
distant catwalk. Somewhere a truck 
or wagon was being pushed irregu- 
larly along an echoing corridor. 
These and the heat and the painted 
bricks of the wall were the only 
clues he had as to his whereabouts. 
“Where am I now, Woulfe?” 
“The time-depth places you in a 
memory about two years back. 
Cassius was at the height of her 
career then. The scene could be in 
any of many places using her 
advice.” 

“Wherever it is, she knew it quite 
well. The detail’s immaculate.” 

“I doubt if there are many politi- 
cal interrogation centers outside 
the iron curtain she doesn’t know in 
detail.” 

The sound of feet marching in 
unison along the walkways herald- 
ed the arrival of a military detail, 
which halted outside the door. 
After a brief pause the door was 
opened and a soldier in brown 
denims entered. 

“You will come.” 

His voice held a trace of a foreign 
accent, possibly Spanish- American. 
Sawyer regarded him curiously. He 
was a creature straight out of 
Cassius’s imagination. As with the 
rats, here was no typical response 
and forgetfulness, here was a di- 
rected purpose — a mental puppet, 
rather than an inhabitant of the 
model. Although the soldier’s re- 
volver remained at his hip he 
carried a heavy black stick which 



160 



GALAXY 




he used with pointed menace. One 
blow across Sawyer’s shoulders 
convinced the physicist of the sub- 
jective reality of the guard. 

Sawyer accepted the wisdom of 
moving toward the door. Outside, a 
large, glass-roofed space covered 
the dizzying height of seven tiers of 
cell blocks arranged in two rows 
about a central hall. The whole was 
entangled by a web of walkways, 
stairways and an occasional bridge 
across the span. An escort of four 
waited outside the door and he 
went meekly to them, having no 
wish to be knocked down even a 
single flight of stairs. 

On the ground floor they tra- 
versed a long corridor and came to 
an office. As he stepped through 
the door he saw Cassius seated at 
the desk, waiting for him. 

“Come in, Martin.” She motion- 
ed for the escort to stay closely at- 
tentive. “This time I choose the 
ground. You won’t get a chance to 
go that deep again. Needless to say, 
I’ll make you regret every second or 
your last invasion into my privacies. 
I also know you’ve some sort of 
random jump device. What I want 
to know is how you actuate it. Are 
you going to tell me or do I have to 
force it out of you?” 

“Why don’t you work out the 
answer to that, Andrea?” 

“I’ll see you in hell first.” 

She motioned to the escort, who 
seized Sawyer’s arms and dragged 
him to a wall where clamps had 
been set to hold his limbs immo- 



bile. Sweating with a sudden fear, 
he struggled against the restraint, 
but took a punch in the stomach 
that made him soften his resistance. 
However, as the clamps tightened 
he relaxed a little, being able to feel 
the comforting form of the jump 
bulb still safely below his palm. 

Cassius borrowed one of the 
black sticks from the guard and 
came to stand in front of him. Her 
eyes held a disturbed and distant 
look, as though the storm in the 
deep wasteland still raged. How- 
ever, there was no doubt of her in- 
tention of doing him some physical 
damage. 

“Watch her,” said Woulfe’s 
voice. “She can’t see the jump bulb 
because it’s attached to the jaunt 
suit out here in the real world, but 
she’s bound to suspect it’s in one of 
your hands. I think she may try to 
break your fingers.” 

Although she could not have 
heard the conversation Cassius 
must have judged from Sawyer’s 
expression that he was in communi- 
cation with the psychiatrist. With a 
sudden snarl of anger she smashed 
with the stick at Sawyer’s hands. 
Fortunately he saw the stick begin 
to travel, and his reaction was in- 
stinctive. He pressed the actuator 
and jumped. Before the scene 
faded, however, he saw the light of 
triumph in her eyes. She knew now 
how he controlled the jump. 

S omething snatched at him, 
slammed him to a halt. Cassius 



WAR OF THE WASTELIFE 



161 




was mastering his jump trick. Not 
only was she halting its random- 
ness — she had also learned to 
control his mobility. Not until the 
new scene crystallized did Sawyer 
realize the full extent of her profi- 
ciency. 

The mind-twisting circumstance 
into which he emerged was painful 
and inverted. His hands were se- 
cured to his ankles and he was sup- 
ported, naked, by a square iron bar 
passed under his knees. He was on 
a “parrots perch” — a favored start- 
ing point for torture interrogation 
in certain parts of the world. 

Whether Cassius was there or not 
he did not know, nor did he wait to 
find out. Barely enough mobility 
was left in his fingers to enable him 
to grasp the jump bulb. Even as he 
maneuvered it to apply pressure to 
the actuator, something started 
tearing his fingers open. In a 
moment of superhuman effort he 
caught the bulb and squeezed. For 
an agonizing second nothing hap- 
pened. The forces tearing at his 
fingers increased. Then, mercifully, 
the scene dissolved. 

“That was too close,” Woulfe 
said. He sounded worried. “She’s 
learned to anticipate you. Next 
time you could be in real trouble. 
I’m going to have to pull you out, 
Martin.” 

“Check. Speed it up, will you, 
Woulfe. Another one as close as 
that could lose me.” 

“Stay out of trouble and don’t at- 
tempt another jump. Withdrawal 



countdown is starting now.” 

Sawyer scanned his new environ- 
ment uneasily. He found he was 
now in one of a series of small 
prison compounds or cages. Behind 
him was a wooden hut. On the re- 
maining three sides barbed wire 
fences rose seven meters high, 
through which he could see row 
upon row of similar cages and an 
occasional guard tower along a dis- 
tant perimeter. Overhead, a brutal 
sun burned from a featureless blue 
sky and the baking sand on which 
he stood tortured his bare feet every 
time he took a step. Examination 
told him that he was dressed in a 
loose tunic of dull gray cloth from 
which previous bloodstains had 
scarcely been removed by washing. 

He swung in alarm as the door of 
the hut clicked open and two dark- 
skinned policemen in tropical uni- 
form came out, revolvers leveled. 

“Two minutes to run,’’ said 
Woulfe. 

The policemen hurried in his di- 
rection. Sawyer could not place 
their nationality, but from their 
features and movements he judged 
that these were trained and edu- 
cated men. Reluctantly he raised 
his hands, stood and waited for the 
arrival of his persecutors. At all 
costs he had to delay for at least 
another minute and a half. While 
one of the men covered him the 
other brought Sawyer’s arms up 
behind his back and fastened them 
with heavy manacles. A gesture 
with a gun precluded any need for 



162 



GALAXY 




speech. They waved him toward the 
hut. 

“One minute to go,” said 
Woulfe. 

Sawyer tried to stall. He received 
a kick and a cuff about the head for 
his trouble. At the door, the crisp 
whiteness of a surgical coat told 
him that he had been right to be 
afraid. Cassius was waiting for 
him, beckoning to his escort with 
impatience. A loaded hypodermic 
syringe was ready in her hands. 

“Thirty seconds, Martin.” 
Woulfe was obviously watching his 
progress. The psychiatrist’s voice 
was his only breath of hope. 

“Quickly, you idiots — the 
sleeve!” Cassius, too, was aware 
that time was running out. 

The policeman needed no second 
telling. Rather than raise the 
sleeve, he tore the garment apart, 
leaving Sawyer’s shoulder exposed 
to the neck. As Sawyer saw the 
needle coming he made a desperate 
twist. This was largely frustrated by 
his other captor’s forcing his man- 
acled hands up behind his back. 
The movement, however, delayed 
Cassius sufficiently for the black 
wing of mind-jaunt withdrawal to 
beat the needle just as it penetrated 
the flesh. 

W ith the blackout came a vio- 
lent and instantaneous head- 
ache that made him feel physically 
ill. Presumably Woulfe had been 
monitoring the incident and had 
cut the withdrawal process critically

short. However, Sawyer counted it 
a small price to pay for removal 
from the hands of Cassius and her 
hypodermic needle. What the 
syringe contained he would prob- 
ably never know. He could imagine 
she would have administered a 
drug that would have immediately 
robbed him of the capacity to 
operate the jump control. 

Wincing with the pain of his 
headache, he stood under the dark- 
ness of the helmet waiting for the 
technicians to come and release 
him from the jaunt suit. He was 
acutely conscious of the narrowness 
of his escape. His shoulder still 
registered a sharp pain where the 
needle had penetrated the flesh, 
and his heart was pumping wildly. 



WAR OF THE WASTELIFE 



163 





Thankfully he felt hands around 
him, removing the packs and re- 
leasing the straps that held the 
helmet and secured the jump bulb 
at his wrist. Leaning forward he 
facilitated the removal of the 
helmet and was rewarded by a wave 
of light that swept in as it was 
lifted. 

The next instant he could have 
cried . 

The awful truth hit him with the 
force almost of a physical blow. 
The withdrawal — the deliverance — 
even Woulfe’s voice was nothing 
but a mind-scene created by 
Cassius’s fertile brain. In reality he 
was still in the helmet, still trapped 
in Cassius’s world and she had 
gained the few precious moments of 
his inattention which she needed to 
render him immobile. It was a 
masterful trap and he had entered 
it without a second thought. His 
position was unchanged — except 
that somebody external to the 
mind-scene had removed the jump 
bulb from his wrist. 

The scene she now presented was 
different and equally daunting. A 
bright light was focused in his face, 
dazzling his eyes. Around and 
beyond it was a blackness he was 
unable to penetrate. The air was 
hot and difficult to breathe. Some- 
thing was restraining his left arm — 
a strong wire noose that drew 
tightly into the flesh as he pulled 
against it. He knew without trying 
that his right arm was similarly 
trapped. These were probably pre- 



calculated to rob him of the chance 
to break his own circuit connec- 
tions on the jaunt suit. 

“My game, I think, Martin,” 
said Cassius, her triumph barely 
concealed in the quietness of her 
voice. 

“Woulfe — get me out of here — ” 
No answer. 

“Woulfe, I want out fast and to 
hell with the damage.” 

No answer. 

“Woulfe — for God’s sake — ” 
“Woulfe isn’t going to answer.” 
Cassius dimmed the light and came 
in front of it, a silhouette from hell 
against the red of the lamp. The 
crisp whiteness of her surgical coat 
made her look the epitome of 
pitiless efficiency. “My friends are 
in control of the monitoring room 
and of the two-mile field. You 
didn’t think I’d let my prize be 
snatched away that easily?” 

“The students — ” Sudden under- 
standing flooded Sawyer’s brain. 

‘‘Yes, the students. Ensuring 
that I’ve complete control over the 
rest of the operation. Congratula- 
tions, Martin! You came closer 
than you knew to finding the real 
me. But for you the game’s over. 
The rest of the play’s all mine.” 

“A priina donna assumption.” 
“No assumption, Martin. Fact.” 
She swung the lamp around to illu- 
minate the farther reaches of the 
brick-lined cell. "Look around you.

wonders what sort of world it is they 
want to develop. Before you con- 
demn me as a barbarian sadist, 
remember the sick minds in your 
own society that dreamed up the in- 
strumentation, and the sick society 
itself that permits and encourages 
its use. What you’ve come to hate 
in me are merely facets where I’ve 
excelled in playing the dirty games 
of your own civilization.” 

“What do you really want from 
me, Andrea?" 

“Revenge for what you’ve done 
tome — and submission. I think the 
terms won’t come readily. But I 
shall win in the end. Don’t dis- 
appoint me, Martin. It would be a 
shame if you gave in too easily.” 

VII 

W oulfe looked up as his 
visitor entered. No-name 
strode furiously into the room, 
threw an envelope on the psychia- 
trist’s desk and prodded it with a 
cigar. 

“Son of a bitch!” he said. “Know 
what this is?” 

Woulfe pursed his lips. “Let me 
guess — without looking. It’s Cas- 
sius’s resignation.” 

“You’re darn right it’s Cassius’s 
resignation. What are you going to 
do about it?” 

“There’s nothing I can do. I can 
scarcely apply persuasion to 
Cassius. She’s the expert. Besides, 
I approve of her resignation. It’s 
probably the only sane action that 



has come out of this whole dismal 
carnival.” 

“Approve,” said No-name. He 
stubbed his cigar so viciously in em- 
phasis that it hit the table and 
fractured lengthwise. He threw the 
fragments away as though its de- 
mise was a personal betrayal. 
“She’s been nobbled again. And 
you’re responsible.” 

“If you’d read her letter instead 
of just shouting about it,” said 
Woulfe, “you’d note she’s preg- 
nant. I see nothing subversive in 
that. After all, she’s a woman.” 
“Whose child is it?” 

“Martin Sawyer’s. And before 
you blow a gasket — let’s make it 
plain that Cassius was not only a 
consenting but an insisting party.” 
“Hell — Sawyer and her? They 
gonna marry?” The unlikelihood of 
the prospect clearly worried the 
man without a name. 

“You not only forgot your 
name — you forgot to do your home- 
work. Cassius is a member of an 
ancient dynastic family called the 
Tsi. They don’t marry. For cen- 
turies Tsi kings and warriors have 
harassed Asia and other parts and 
they’ve always taken concubines by 
force. They take only the women 
best fitted to contribute something 
to the Tsi stock. Your modern Tsi’s 
a tough, intelligent, cosmopolitan 
and utterly ruthless character, 
trained from infancy in the arts of 
war and survival.” 

“What’s that got to do with 
Cassius?” 



WAR OF THE WASTELIFE

“Surplus female Tsi children 
used to be killed at birth. Under 
Chu Tsi, the present head of the 
family, they’ve entered a new age of 
enlightenment. Instead of killing 
the female children, they now train 
them as warriors equally with the 
men. Cassius is one of these.” 

“Son of a bitch!” said No-name, 
with a slight touch of awe. 

“Female emancipation’s produc- 
ed an interesting situation. A Tsi 
woman can’t go out and drag her- 
self back a concubine or two. But 
she can select a powerful adversary, 
conquer him, and carry his seed 
back to the Tsi. You’ll note the em- 
phasis on conquest. No feminine 
wiles. She’s one of the kingmakers. 
She needs to be able to enforce sub- 
mission against all opposition.” 

“God! Is that what she did to 
Sawyer?” 

“I don’t know. Cassius’s hench- 
men cut my monitors before 
matters became crucial. But know- 
ing Martin — I doubt he put up 
more than a token fight. He’s been 
fascinated by Cassius almost as 
much as she’s been preoccupied by 
him.” 

“So how do we get her back?” he 
asked. 

“You’ve no chance at all. Cassius 
came to the Western world and 
mastered one of the more discredit- 
able aspects of our democracy. She 
became a legend in her own right. 
Now she’s returning home, taking 
with her the seed of one of our more 
with-it physicists. Whichever way 



you look at it, Cassius has con- 
quered.” 

“But a child? Damn — she could 
be back at work within a year.” 
“You miss the point entirely. Old 
Chu Tsi is dying. The all-male tra- 
dition having been broken, the 
chances are that the House of Tsi 
will have a mistress next, instead of 
a master. That’s Cassius’s aim. 
And if that happens your troubles 
in Asia are only just beginning.” 
“Whose side you on? Seems to be 
you’ve sold Sawyer down the river — 
and lost us Cassius.” 

“Actually I did neither. Cassius 
came back from America specifi- 
cally looking for Sawyer. She’d 
have caught up with him sooner or 
later, anyway. All I did was 
catalyze the reaction.” 

No-name rose respondently to his 
feet and walked over to the door. 
“What happened to JSawyer, any- 
way? Did he survive the deal?” 
“He acquired a lacerated back. 
And an enigmatic smile. You see, 
from his point of view he’s the 
winner. He’s got Cassius away from 
the persuasion scene and turned 
her toward the gentler pursuits of 
motherhood. By design or accident 
he’s achieved what he set out to do. 
Whatever it cost him, I guarantee 
he’s well pleased with the results.” 
“Son of a bitch!” said No-name. 
“That’s real dedication. You never 
did say whose man he was.” 

“Not even Cassius believes it, but 
he really is just an innocent by- 
stander.” ♦

old doorways in the stony city, see- 
ing a lump of some kind of life 
thrown on the top step. Some 
lump, some dirty sack, some aban- 
doned life, Terran or alien, in one 
of the old parts of the city. 

The day was the color of gran- 
ite — Mrs. Crandy’s pause was a 
brief one. Then she walked on 
toward the yarn shop she had 
owned for years. The shop was on 
the second floor of a fairly good 
building, just beyond the grim old 
section of the city, on the gradual 
slope up into decency and middle 
income. She’d only walked this 
route because it was so much 
shorter — in nice weather she pre- 
ferred the longer way through a 
better area. Today's chill air made 
her walk fast to get her circulation 
going and she had tried not to look 
to her left or right but keep her 
gaze fixed on the goal ahead. 

By keeping her eyes straight 
ahead she had gone through life 
without too much torment, though 
she had a kind heart and good 
friends — and she had seen a bit of 
the worlds, too, on various short 
trips here and there. 

A block onward, she still saw in 
her mind’s shocked eye the bit of 
bad news thrown up against a 
stranger’s door — the size and shape 
of a child. She felt that she could 
not go back, stir the rags, expose 
the wounds — she could not, as 
everyone continually told her, be- 
friend all the lonelys or feed all the 
hungrys. Like everyone else, she 



must attend to her own business 
and curl up with satisfaction inside 
the warm circle of acquaintances. 
Beyond the circle lay the madness 
of the universe, the hungers of an 
insatiable tide of running, crawl- 
ing, wing-beating, slithering life. 

Nor could she go on. Momen- 
tarily locked in cruel hesitation, 
Mrs. Crandy stood on the broken 
sidewalk and did nothing but 
breathe. 

“All right, damn it,” she said 
aloud, then glanced left and right, 
embarrassed — what would people 
think of her talking to herself in the 
street? But the people passed her 
without noticing, just as she had 
hoped to pass them, and it stung 
her, this indifference to which she 
herself had aspired. 

Mrs. Crandy retraced her steps, 
almost literally, keeping her eyes 
down and imagining that she was 
stepping backward into her own 
footsteps. 

The shape still lay huddled in the 
doorway. One small green plastic 
sandal was visible, containing what 
appeared to be a human foot. Still, 
one never knew, she thought. One 
never knew what rose up above the 
recognizable; alien shapes and 
brains, weird entities convinced of 
their own rightfulness and rights, 
hostile teeth and bad breath reek- 
ing of awful dinners. 

Mrs. Crandy slowly went up the 
five stone steps and leaned over but 
tried to keep her face out of reach, 
like a swimmer who does not want

to get water up the nose. No telling, 
she thought, what the creatures 
would do if startled, perhaps reach 
up with talons and damage her. 

“Child?” she said, for that was 
how it looked. 

The lump stirred, a second green 
plastic sandal emerged from the 
rusty folds, a spine moved and at 
the top of the spine a head rose. 
Rather small, crinkly black eyes 
looked at her. A small pink mouth 
opened into a big yawn and she 
could see the child was missing 
some teeth. Whether it was teeth- 
ing normally or whether it suffered 
tooth rot from malnutrition, she 
couldn’t tell. 

“Do you live here?” Mrs. Crandy 
asked. She really did not know how 
to approach a conversation like 
this, though she was aware of the 
dangers of patronizing the young of 
any life form. 

“Naw,” the child said, stirring 
even more, then getting to her feet. 

“Have you no place to sleep?” 

‘‘Was sleepin’ here. Name’s 
Agnes. What’s yours?” 

“Do you have a home?” Mrs. 
Crandy asked. The child’s clothing, 
a coatlike dress tied around the 
waist by a cloth belt of some other 
fabric, was rotting and gone in the 
seams. Under this shapeless robe, 
she could tell, the child was like a 
stick. 

“Naw. But I bet you do. Lady, 
you got a nice home?” 

“When did you eat last, Agnes?” 

“S’mornin'. Piece of lemon pie.” 



“Lemon pie!” How like a child. 
But she must have stolen it, Mrs. 
Crandy thought immediately. It 
must have been the only thing she 
could get her hands on. 

on,” Mrs. Crandy said. 

^/‘I have to go to my shop. 
You come with me and we can have 
lunch together.” 

“Naw.” 

“Why not?” 

“You’ll feed me but you’ll call 
authorities.” 

“They won’t hurt you,” Mrs. 
Crandy said, sighing. “What can 
they do that will make things worse 
for you than they are?” 

“They’ll brick me,” Agnes said. 

In spite of the quaint phrasing, 
Mrs. Crandy understood perfectly, 
with a kind of cold gelling of the 
heart’s blood. They’ll brick me. In- 
deed they would, she knew. Bowls 
of soup and clean cotton dresses 
wouldn’t compensate Agnes for 
being shut up. 

“I won’t call them, but come to 
the shop and get warm, and we’ll 
eat something.” She was getting 
thoroughly chilled, standing here, 
arguing with this irresponsible but 
apparently satisfied child. Oh, she 
can’t be satisfied, Mrs. Crandy cor- 
rected herself, not in that crummy 
dress, and so thin, and her hair 
matted. The hair was nearly white; 
flaxen; though it was now darkened 
with soot and less nameable dirt. 
The whole small creature seemed 
ineffably soiled. 



COOL AFFECTION 



169 




Agnes shook the folds of her robe 
and took a step down, then looked 
back, archly, over her shoulder and 
upward to Mrs. Crandy’s face. 
“Promise?” she asked, 

“I don’t promise a thing, but 
you’re free to go any time,” Mrs. 
Crandy said, stepping down beside 
her. For a moment she wanted to 
hold the girl’s hand, but had a 
notion it would feel chapped and 
scaly with dirt and the gesture 
would probably embarrass them 
both. They went along the sidewalk 
together, the child taking quick, 
short steps. 

When they passed a Ganymedean 
restaurant, with its windows frost- 
laced on the inside, Mrs. Crandy 
averted her face as a kind of cour- 
tesy, more than a recoil, but Agnes 
hung back and peered in with a 
terrible, devouring curiosity. The 
Ganymedean restaurant owner 
came to the icy glass door and, with 
his one thumb and two fingers at 
the end of a tentacular arm, pulled 
down an inside shade against 
Agnes’ prying face. Serves her 
right, Mrs. Crandy thought invol- 
untarily. 

“They’re snobs,” Agnes said. 
“Great bulby-ho snobs.” 

Mrs. Crandy was amused in spite 
of herself. “Wherever did you get 
that?” she asked. 

“I been around,” Agnes said 
smugly. 

Well, I bet you have, Mrs. 
Crandy thought. She asked, 
“Where are you from?” 



“I’m from where you found me. 
Sleepin’ on the step.” 

“No, seriously,” Mrs. Crandy 
argued. “You must be living some- 
where, even if you don’t have a 
family. Not all the time in the 
street. Isn’t there anyone who 
would worry if you didn’t show 
up?” 

“Plenty people,” Agnes said in 
such a tone of rage that Mrs. 
Crandy knew no one cared. “Every- 
body loves me,” Agnes shrieked. 
The sound, sharp as a toothpick, 
pierced the cold, sullen air and 
even the hides of a few passersby, 
who looked around. But Agnes 
clamped her mouth shut. 

Mrs. Crandy, her heart gaping, 
took hold of the child’s hand. She’d 
been right — it was chapped, lump- 
ed with dirt and spoke of painful 
neglect. No, I will not lose my head, 
Mrs. Crandy promised herself and 
her absent friends and advisors, 
but neither will I just abandon her 
in the street. There must be a sen- 
sible middle way. Even if I only get 
her cleaned and warm. I won’t even 
think beyond that. 

Agnes grew silent as they came to 
the better part of town, as they 
entered the doorway between shop 
fronts, climbed the flight of stairs, 
and as Mrs. Crandy unlocked the 
door of her shop. 

“Oh,” Agnes said when they 
entered. The yarns lay in their 
slots, orange, yellow, rust, gold, 
chocolate; green, aqua, turquoise, 
baby blue, cobalt. Hundreds and 



170 



GALAXY 




hundreds of skeins of yarn. The 
walls were hung with petit point 
and crewel patterns — there were 
shelves devoted to small looms and 
weaving material. Agnes turned 
around, dazzled, her mouth open. 

“What pretty,” Agnes said, 
around and around, glaring with 
joy and surprise. “Oh, what 
pretty," she said. 

“Let's get you washed,” Mrs. 
Crandy said. “Then, if you like, I’ll 
teach you a knitting stitch and you 
can pick any color yarn you like.” 

Getting scrubbed did help, but 
not as much as she’d hoped for. 
Apparently the child’s skin had 
suffered real damage, because it re- 
mained rough, lumpy, almost 
scaly. Under the robe Agnes wore 
only a shabby bikini. Her small, 
skinny body had a serpentine 
quality, like that of a dancer’s; she 
might have been pretty if cleaned 
better than Mrs. Crandy could do 
in the tiny washroom. But the face 
was so pointed, the eyes so small 
and crinkly, the neck so long and 
flexible, she would never be pretty. 
It doesn’t matter, Mrs. Crandy told 
herself. What difference does it 
make? As if looks lasted. The 
child’s been abused and starved; all 
I can do is try to put a little comfort 
on her bones, nothing more than 
that. 

Mrs. Crandy hated to put the 
dirty robe back on Agnes but there 
was not a thing in the shop to be 
used as a substitute. At lunch time 
she’d go round the corner and buy

Agnes a pair of slacks and a good 
warm sweater. She turned up the 
heat and sat at her desk. 

Agnes leaned over, looking at the 
desk calendar. 

“Last day of March,” she said. 
‘‘Come April, come May.” She 
looked sideways at Mrs. Crandy. 
“You here in the hot?” 

“The shop’s open all the time, 
except for two weeks in August 
when 1 like to go to the beach. 
Why?” 

“You got a cooler, huh?” 
“Yes.” Mrs. Crandy smiled. 
“But it’s so cold today — you can’t 
be worried yet about summer 
weather.” 

“1 worry all the time,” Agnes 
said suavely. “I worry and worry, it 
keeps the brain going.” 

“Nonsense. Worrying makes you 
skinny and old before your time. 
Speaking of old, how old are you?” 
Agnes looked down at her green 
plastic sandals. ‘‘I suppose you 
wouldn’t believe me, fifteen.” 
“No,” Mrs. Crandy said shortly. 
“Go and pick out any color of yarn 
you like and I’ll show you how to 
knit. Then I have work to do and 
customers will be coming in.” 
Agnes did not spend long in 
choosing. The pale blues, the grays 
and silvers, seemed to appeal to 
her. Mrs. Crandy was delighted at 
how quickly Agnes learned to 
handle the needles, how her thin 
fingers manipulated the pearl-gray 
yarn. Agnes sat on a wooden chair 
in the far corner, concentrating, 



her head down, matted flaxen 
crown exposed to Mrs. Crandy’s 
gaze. She was so small and so slip- 
pery looking, Mrs. Crandy thought. 
No, I cannot feed them all, but 
surely I can do a few little things for 
this one. She bent to the books on 
her desk. 

Now and then she heard Agnes 
mutter. Once, she was sure she 
heard: ‘‘Bulby snobs, old ten- 
tacles,” and wondered, sadly, what 
or who had inculcated these archaic 
prejudices in the child. 

T he heat, silently rising in the 
walls, silently spreading its 
wooly shawl through the shop and 
over Mrs. Crandy’s chilled shoul- 
ders, should have made the child 
snuggle and relax. Although Agnes 
was obviously slowing down, per- 
haps falling into a daydream, she 
did not look comfortable. Mrs. 
Crandy was distracted from her by 
a customer coming in to match a 
particular color. When the custo- 
mer had gone Mrs. Crandy looked 
at the corner and saw Agnes sitting 
with a kind of tense sloppiness, her 
eyes wide and staring. 

“Child!” Mrs. Crandy said, 
alarmed. Agnes should be comfy, 
approaching happiness and satis- 
faction. The possibility that Mrs. 
Crandy was harboring some one of 
those unfamiliar and alien forms 
often passed in the street, coiled 
through the woman’s mind with a 
bizarre writhing motion. She con- 
demned her reactions, her feelings,

as immoral and unworthy. Because 
even if Agnes were not a human 
child, she was a child just the same, 
hungry for attention, for affection, 
for warmth. No matter what she 
was, Agnes, like everyone, had 
needs. It was Mrs. Crandy’s re- 
sponsibility, she knew, to try to find 
out what they were and to try to 
supply them as well as she could. 

When she went to Agnes, she saw 
a single tear slop over the corner of 
the child’s left eye. It was pearly 
gray — it was tangible. It seemed to 
have a mineral substance — and was 
terrifying. 

“Oh, God,” Mrs. Crandy said. 
“What is it — what is it? What’s 
wrong?” 

“Lift me,” Agnes said through 
almost motionless lips. 

As Mrs. Crandy bent to lift 
Agnes the tear fell from the child’s 
face and struck Mrs. Crandy’s bare 
wrist. It bounced off her skin, cold 
and stern as a hailstone. “Dear 
God,” Mrs. Crandy implored, lift- 
ing the sluggish body in her arms. 
“Agnes, try to tell me what’s 
wrong.” 

“Blood,” Agnes said through her 
rigid lips. “Homeostat. Not like 
yours. Get me cold.” 

Mrs. Crandy wasn’t sure what 
homeostat was, but she understood 
cold. She carried Agnes back to the 
washroom and ran ice water into 
the basin. Moving with terrible ef- 
fort, Agnes put her hands into the 
cold water and sighed. She got wet 
to the elbows, and after a minute, 



put her face down and poured 
water over it. 

Her face rose, dripping. “Want- 
ed warm like mother,” Agnes said, 
her tongue stiff. “Wanted you to 
feed me. Lady, I wanted bad.” She 
doused herself again, ran cold 
water on her neck, drank many 
mouthfuls of it and slowly revived. 

“Agnes, shall I turn off the heat? 
Will that help?” 

The child stood with rivulets of 
cold water running down from her 
wet hair. “No, lady, make you 
cold.” 

“What can I do?” 

“Nothing. I do it.” Agnes turned 
around and shuffled out of the 
washroom, across the carpet, to the 
door of the shop. She muttered, “I 
wanted bad.” 

When she opened the door, Mrs. 
Crandy ran to her, pulled her back. 
“You can’t just go back to the 
street out there, you can’t sleep in 
doorways on cold stone.” 

“Sure can. Keep me goin’. Come 
May, come June, I’m goin’ to 
suffer, I guess.” 

“Look, I’ve turned down the 
heat. I’ll put on my coat. You stay 
here and try to tell me.” 

“Tell you nothin’. You been nice 
and I liked it. But you don’t wanna 
know.” Agnes made some gesture 
with her arm toward the door. Her 
forelimb rippled in a strange 
fashion, and in her mind’s shocked 
eye, Mrs. Crandy saw again the 
Ganymedean tentacle come out and 
pull down the restaurant shade.

“Before you go, Agnes, will you 
answer a question?” 

“If I can do.” 

“Who is, or was, your father?” 
asked Mrs. Crandy. 

The crinkly black eyes gazed un- 
winking at her. The air in the shop 
was cooling rapidly and Agnes was 
growing more sprightly. “Hit you, 
didn’t it?” Agnes said, showing the 
gaps in her teeth. “You don’t know 
what is a homeostat, do you?” 

“1 think I do. It controls body 
temperature. As in Ganymedeans, 
who do not function in warmth and 
keep to a cold environment.” 

“As in you,” Agnes said. “Yours 
changes to suit weather. I guess you 
know what luck is. See, in me, it 
don’t work like my mother. I just 
try to keep me cool.” 

“You can’t be one of a kind, 
Agnes. There must be comfortable 
places for others like you.” 

“Sure. Been there. Busted out. 
Father’s kind say poo, funny, with 
hair. Mother’s like you. So I keep 
me myself.” 

“I’ll open the window and it’ll be 
cold enough in here.” Mrs. Crandy 
still wanted to try, although she 
knew, beyond hope, there was 
nothing she could do for the needs 
of the child — she was incapable of 
supplying balm for them. 

“Naw. Lady, you been nice and I 
dreamed it would work but it don’t 
work. You goin’ to get awful cold, 
see, and I don’t want to be respon- 
sible. Got enough keepin’ me.” 
“No, damn it,” Mrs. Crandy 



said, “it’s not enough for any of us, 
just keeping ourselves. I can wear 
warm underwear and several 
sweaters and I’ll take you to a good 
medical center where they must be 
able to help you.” 

“Help.” Agnes chewed the word. 
“I been there. They brick me. I told 
you.” 

Mrs. Crandy saw it, all right. 
Agnes strapped into a technical 
chair, being probed, her brain 
waves recorded, her blood tempera- 
ture monitored. Living under a plas- 
tic sky, poked and stared at — brick- 
ed. Agnes, the universal unwanted 
child, Agnes, who knew better than 
she, Mrs. Crandy, with all her 
worldly experience, just how the 
world treats its human bastards, 
and does not even recognize its alien 
disasters. 

“I’d like to give you something,” 
Mrs. Crandy said. 

Agnes looked around the shop. 
“Knit?” 

“Yes, of course.” Mrs. Crandy 
put the needles and pearl gray wool 
into a bag and gave them to the 
child. Agnes looked into the brown 
paper depths. “Nice,” she said. 
“Goodbye, lady. I remember you. 
Can’t do no else.” 

“Goodbye, Agnes,” Mrs. Crandy 
said. 

Agnes opened the door and stood 
there. “Lady,” she said, “just I ask 
you. You see me sleepin’ on a step, 
don’t try to warm, okay?” 

“Okay,” Mrs. Crandy said and 
watched the shop door close.

Here’s how the Club works: 



When your application for membership is accepted, you’ll 
receive your choice of 4 books for just 100 (plus shipping and 
handling). If not absolutely fascinated, return them within ten 
days — membership will be cancelled and you’ll owe nothing. 



About every 4 weeks (14 times a year), we’ll send you the 
Club’s bulletin describing the 2 coming Selections and 
Alternate choices. If you want both Selections, you need do 
nothing: they’ll be shipped automatically. If you don’t want a 
Selection, or prefer an Alternate, or no book at all, just fill out 
the form always provided, and return it to us by the date 
specified. We try to allow you at least ten days for making your 
decision. If you don't get the form in time to respond within 
10 days, and receive an unwanted selection, you may return it 
at our expense. 



As a member you need take only 4 Selections 
or Alternates during the coming year. You may 
resign any time thereafter. Most books cost 
only $1.49 plus shipping and handling. Occa- 
sionally, extra-value Selections are slightly 
higher. So join now. Send no money. But mail 
the coupon today.
