YOURS FOR A DIME! 



T AST month’s editorial at- 
tempted to show — with rath- 
er more levity than I feel — how 
disheartening it is to slog through 
thousands of dreary manuscripts 
per year to find the 130 or so that 
are genuinely worth publishing. 

How do we break up the trunk- 
to-tail parade and set each 
writer off on his own path of ex- 
ploration? I don’t know, but I’m 
trying so hard that I would wish 
I hadn’t thrown away that truss, 
if I had a truss to throw away. 

All right, let’s up with the ink- 
stained sleeves and have at it, 
shall we? Writer or not, you’ll be 
interested. I think, because I in- 
tend to toss off — after due 
examination — an idea that I 
guarantee could have sold, just 
to jolt would-be contributors out 
of their maddening lock-step. 

Readers habitually ask writers. 
“Where do you get your ideas?” 
The honest answer would be. in 
the case of the chain-gang scribes, 
“I see them somewhere and they 
come to me in a flash.” 

This idea I have in mind — I’ll 
tell you exactly where it came 
from: 

It came from a cereal box. 

Like most good Americans, I 
obediently grit away on the dried 
bread crumbs called breakfast 
food, meanwhile gazing with 



bleak eyes at the gaudy boxes 
they come in, noting vacantly 
the Bronco Joe nite-lite com- 
passes, the spaceship rings with 
compartments for secret mes- 
sages. and the rest, all to be had 
by sending in a box top and a 
coin. 

Premiums! 

Where did they start? How far 
have they come since then? By 
contrasting the present with the 
past, what influence might they 
have on the future? 

For the research on these 
questions, my fond thanks to 
Evelyn E. Smith . and a bit 
of regret, too. for she could have 
made such a beautifully inven- 
tive story out of the subject of 
premiums. Still, if it shows imi- 
tative writers how to go about 
getting ideas, it’s worth the con- 
siderable sacrifice. 

Probably the first company to 
offer premiums was B. T. Bab- 
bitt, who stopped selling soap 
by weight from long slabs, and 
wrapped a lithograph in each 
package, thus making two im- 
portant innovations. The date 
was 1851 — just over 100 years 
ago — and now more than one 
billion dollars' worth of mer- 
chandise is given away or sold 
at less than cost per year! 

Listen to these statistics: 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



4 




Thirty per cent of all china 
ware, 15 per cent of all enamel 
ware and 10 per cent of all alum- 
inum ware manufactured in this 
country are sold or given away 
annually as premiums! 

The amount of balloons, guns 
(from Old West to Futuristic), 
airplane kits and such bedazzling 
items for children is almost in- 
calculable. The New Yorker once 
ran a cartoon of an advertising 
man’s dream: a TV announcer 
holding up a cereal box and 
yelping. “Look, kids! All pre- 
miums ... no cereal!’’ 

Crackerjacks undoubtedly 
originated the custom of pack- 
aging prizes, but the idea has 
bloomed so Hugely that high- 
power companies exist solely to 
think up. sell, manufacture and 
service youth industries. 

In the adult trade, durable 
goods and jewelry are the two 
most popular premiums. Ice 
cream companies induce stores 
to sell their brand by offering 
tables, chairs, freezers; brewers 
give bars electric signs, radios 
and now TV sets: Fuller Brush 
salesmen hand housewives free 
brushes to lower sales resistance. 

By purchasing only items that 
give profit-sharing coupons, you 
can literally furnish a whole 
home. Of course, it Would take 
years and you may smoke and 
soap yourself to death, but it 
can be done. 



In most cases, the sponsor’s 
profit is good will alone. Thus, 
a 25c locket liquidates itself as 
follows: cost of jewelry. 16^c; 
federal tax, 4c; mail-handling 
charge, 2^^c; stamp, Ic; box, ^c; 
grief, Yi,c. Total, 25c. 

There are three principal meth- 
ods of distribution: 

Free Offer — mail-in request; 
store-visit gift; demonstration 
premium. 

Combination Offer — over the 
counter: redemption station; 

loading deal (premiums given to 
dealers at no extra cost for or- 
dering certain quantity). 

Purchase Privilege — box tops, 
labels, coupons, punch card, etc. 

Toys, jewelry, household items, 
cars, store equipment, sporting 
goods ... all of it beginning with 
a simple litho wrapped around 
a cake of soap . grown to a 
$1 ,000,000,000-a-year giant in a 
single century! 

The impact on our economy 
and buying habits has been 
enormous. Imagine what would 
happen if that rate of growth 
continued! Who’d need money? 
Before you leap up with an an- 
swer. consider this : Cigar-store 
coupons were used as legal ten- 
der in many U. S. towns during 
the depression!

ideas?’’ From everywhere — in-

yes — but a mechanic's kit is best of alll

searching the floor to see if the 
dream explosion had thrown her 
down. 

But she wasn’t there. Of course 
she wasn’t, he told himself, look- 
ing at the familiar vanity and 
slipper chair, the uncracked win- 
dow, the unbuckled wall. It had 
only been a dream. 

“Guy?” His wife was calling 
him querulously from the foot 
of the stairs. “Guy, dear, are you 
all right?” 

He called weakly, “Sure.” 

There was a pause. Then Mary 
said doubtfully, “Breakfast is 
ready. Are you sure you’re all 
right? I thought I heard you 
yelling — ” 

Burckhardt said more confi- 
dently, “I had a bad dream, 
honey. Be right down.” 

I N THE shower, punching the 
lukewarm-and-cologne he fa- 
vored, he told himself that it had 
been a beaut of a dream. Still, 
bad dreams weren’t unusual, 
especially bad dreams about ex- 
plosions. In the past thirty years 
of H-bomb jitters, who had not 
dreamed of explosions? 

Even Mary had dreamed of 
them, it turned out, for he start- 
ed to tell her about the dream, 
but she cut him off. “You did?" 
Her voice was astonished. “Why, 
dear, I dreamed the same thing! 
Well, almost the same thing. I 
didn’t actually hear anything. I 



dreamed that something woke me 
up, and then there was a sort of 
quick bang, and then something 
hit me on the head. And that was 
all. Was yours like that?” 

Burckhardt coughed. “Well, 
no,” he said. Mary was not one 
of these strong-as-a-man, brave- 
as-a-tiger women. It was not nec- 
essary, he thought, to tell her all 
the little details of the dream 
that made it seem so real. No 
need to mention the splintered 
ribs, and the salt bubble in his 
throat, and the agonized knowl- 
edge that this was death. He said, 
“Maybe there really was some 
kind of explosion downtown. 
Maybe we heard it and it started 
us dreaming.” 

Mary reached over and patted 
his hand absently. “Maybe,” she 
agreed. “It’s almost half-past 
eight, dear. Shouldn’t you hurry? 
You don’t want to be late to the 
office.” 

He gulped his food, kissed her 
and rushed out — not so much to 
be on time as to see if his guess 
had been right. 

But downtown Tylerton look- 
ed as it always had. Coming in 
on the bus, Burckhardt watched 
critically out the window, seeking 
evidence of an explosion. There 
wasn’t any. If anything, Tyler- 
ton looked better than it ever had 
before: It was a beautiful crisp 
day, the sky was cloudless, the 
buildings were clean and inviting. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




They had, he observed, steam- 
blasted the Power & Light Build- 
ing, the town’s only skyscraper — 
that was the penalty of having 
Contro Chemical’s main plant on 
the outskirts of town; the fumes 
from the cascade stills left their 
mark on stone buildings. 

None of the usual crowd were 
on the bus, so there wasn’t any- 
one Burckhardt could ask about 
the explosion. And by the time 
he got out at the corner of Fifth 
and Lehigh and the bus rolled 
away with a muted diesel moan, 
he had pretty well convinced him- 
self that it was all imagination. 

He stopped at the cigar stand 
in the lobby of his office building, 
but Ralph wasn’t behind the 
counter. The man who sold him 
his pack of cigarettes was a 
stranger. 

“Where’s Mr. Stebbins?’’ 
Burckhardt asked. 

The man said politely, “Sick, 
sir. He’ll be in tomorrow. A pack 
of Marlins today?” 

“Chesterfields,” Burckhardt 
corrected. 

“Certainly, sir,” the man said. 
But what he took from the rack 
and slid across the counter was 
an unfamiliar green-and-yellow 
pack. 

“Do try these, sir,” he sug- 
gested. “They contain an anti- 
cough factor. Ever notice how 
ordinary cigarettes make you 
choke every once in a while?” 



¥>URCKHARDT said suspi- 
ciously, “I never heard of this 
brand.” 

“Of course not. They’re some- 
thing new.” Burckhardt hesi- 
tated, and the man said persua- 
sively, “Look, try them out at my 
risk. If you don’t like them, bring 
back the empty pack and I’ll re- 
fund your money. Fair enough?” 
Burckhardt shrugged. “How 
can I lose? But give me a pack 
of Chesterfields, too, will you?” 
He opened the pack and lit one 
while he waited for the elevator. 
They weren’t bad, he decided, 
though he was suspicious of cig- 
arettes that had the tobacco 
chemically treated in any way. 
But he didn’t think much of 
Ralph’s stand-in; it would raise 
hell with the trade at the cigar 
stand if the man tried to give 
every customer the same high- 
pressure sales talk. 

The elevator door opened with 
a low-pitched sound of music. 
Burckhardt and two or three 
others got in and he nodded to 
them as’ the door closed. The 
thread of music switched off and 
the speaker in the ceiling of the 
cab began its usual commercials. 

No, not the usual commercials, 
Burckhardt realized. He had been 
exposed to the captive-audience 
commercials so long that they 
hardly registered on the outer ear 
any more, but what was coming 
from the recorded program in the 



THE TUNNEL UNDER THE 



WORLD 



9 




basement of the building caught 
his attention. It wasn’t merely 
that the brands were mostly un- 
familiar; it was a difference in 
pattern. 

There were jingles with an in- 
sistent, bouncy rhythm, about 
soft drinks he had never tasted. 
There was a rapid patter dialogue 
between what sounded like two 
ten-year-old boys about a candy 
bar, followed by an authoritative 
bass rumble: “Go right out and 
get a DELICIOUS Choco-Bite 
and eat your TANGY Choco- 
Bite all up. That’s Choco-Bite!” 
There was a sobbing female 
whine: “I wish I had a Feckle 
Freezer! I’d do anything for a 
Feckle Freezer!’’ Burckhardt 
reached his floor and left the ele- 
vator in the middle of the last 
one. It left him a little uneasy. 
The commercials were not for 
familiar brands; there was no 
feeling of use and custom to 
them. 

But the office was happily nor- 
mal — except that Mr. Barth was- 
n’t in. Miss Mitkin, yawning at 
the reception desk, didn’t know 
exactly why. “His home phoned, 
that’s all. He’ll be in tomorrow.’’ 

“Maybe he went to the plant. 
It’s right near his house.’’ 

She looked indifferent. “Yeah.’’ 

A thought struck Burckhardt. 
“But today is June 15th! It’s 
quarterly tax return day — he has 
to sign the return!’’ 



Miss Mitkin shrugged to indi- 
cate that that was Burckhardt’s 
problem, not hers. She returned 
to her nails. 

Thoroughly exasperated, 
Burckhardt went to his desk. It 
wasn’t that he couldn’t sign the 
tax returns as well as Barth, he 
thought resentfully. It simply 
wasn’t his job, that was all; it was 
a responsibility that Barth, as 
office manager for Contro Chem- 
icals’ downtown office, should 
have taken. 

TTE THOUGHT briefly of call- 
ing Barth at his home or try- 
ing to reach him at the factory, 
but he gave up the idea quickly 
enough. He didn’t really care 
much for the people at the fac- 
tory and the less contact he had 
with them, the better. He had 
been to the factory once, with 
Barth; it had been a confusing 
and, in a way, a frightening ex- 
perience. Barring a handful of 
executives and engineers, there 
wasn’t a soul in the factory — that 
is, Burckhardt corrected himself, 
remembering what Barth had told 
him, not a living soul — just the 
machines. 

According to Barth, each ma- 
chine was controlled by a sort of 
computer which reproduced, in 
its electronic snarl, the actual 
memory and mind of a human 
being. It was an unpleasant 
thought. Barth, laughing, had as- 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




sured him that there was no 
Frankenstein business of robbing 
graveyards and implanting brains 
in machines. It was only a mat- 
ter, he said, of transferring a 
man’s habit patterns from brain 
cells to vacuum-tube cells. It did- 
n’t hurt the man and it didn’t 
make the machine into a monster. 

But they made Burckhardt un- 
comfortable all the same. 

He put Barth and the factory 
and all his other little irritations 
out of his mind and tackled the 
tax returns. It took him until 
noon to verify the figures — which 
Barth could have done out of his 
memory and his private ledger 
in ten minutes. Burckhardt re- 
sentfully reminded himself. 

He sealed them in an envelope 
and walked out to Miss Mitkin. 
“Since Mr. Barth isn’t here, we’d 
better go to lunch in shifts,” he 
said. “You can go first.” 

“Thanks.” Miss Mitkin lan- 
guidly took her bag out of the 
desk drawer and began to apply 
makeup. 

Burckhardt offered her the en- 
velope. “Drop this in the mail for 
me, will you? Uh — wait a minute. 
I wonder if I ought to phone Mr. 
Barth to make sure. Did his wife 
say whether he was able to take 
phone calls?” 

“Didn’t say.” Miss Mitkin 
blotted her lips carefully with a 
Kleenex. “Wasn’t his wife, any- 
way. It was his daughter who 



called and left the message.” 
“The kid?” Burckhardt frown- 
ed. “I thought she was away at 
school.” 

“She called, that’s all I know.” 
Burckhardt went back to his 
own office and stared distasteful- 
ly at the unopened mail on his 
desk. He didn’t like nightmares; 
they spoiled his whole day. He 
should have stayed in bed. like 
Barth. 

A FUNNY thing happened on 
his way home. There was a 
disturbance at the corner where 
he usually caught his bus — some- 
one was screaming something 
about a new kind of deep-freeze 
— so he walked an extra block. 
He saw the bus coming and start- 
ed to trot. But behind him, some- 
one was calling his name. He 
looked over his shoulder; a small 
harried-looking man was hurry- 
ing toward him. 

Burckhardt hesitated, and then 
recognized him. It was a casual 
acquaintance named Swanson. 
Burckhardt sourly observed that 
he had already missed the bus. 
He said, “Hello.” 

Swanson’s face was desperate- 
ly eager. “Burckhardt?” he asked 
inquiringly, with an odd inten- 
sity. And then he just stood there 
silently, watching Burckhardt’s 
face, with a burning eagerness 
that dwindled to a faint hope and 
died to a regret. He was search- 



THE TUNNEL UNDER THE WORLD 



11 




ing for something, waiting for 
something, Burckhardt thought. 
But whatever it was he wanted, 
Burckhardt didn’t know how to 
supply it. 

Burckhardt coughed and said 
again, “Hello, Swanson.” 

Swanson didn’t even acknowl- 
edge the greeting. He merely 
sighed a very deep sigh. 

“Nothing doing,” he mumbled, 
apparently to himself. He nod- 
ded abstractedly to Burckhardt 
and turned away. 

Burckhardt watched the 
slumped shoulders disappear in 
the crowd. It was an odd sort of 
day, he thought, and one he did- 
-n’t much like. Things weren’t 
going right. 

Riding home on the next bus, 
he brooded about it. It wasn’t 
anything terrible or disastrous; 
it was something out of his ex- 
perience entirely. You live your 
life, like any man, and you form 
a network of impressions and re- 
actions. You expect things. When 
you open your medicine chest, 
your razor is expected to be on 
the second shelf; when you lock 
your front door, you expect to 
have to give it a slight extra tug 
to make it latch. 

It isn’t the things that are right 
and perfect in your life that make 
it familiar. It is the things that 
are just a little bit wrong — the 
sticking latch, the light switch at 
the head of the stairs that needs 



an extra push because the spring 
is old and weak, the rug that un- 
failingly skids underfoot. 

It wasn’t just that things were 
wrong with the pattern of Burck- 
hardt’s life ; it was that the wrong 
things were wrong. For instance, 
Barth hadn’t come into the office, 
yet Barth always came in. 

Burckhardt brooded about it 
through dinner. He brooded 
about it, despite his wife’s at- 
tempt to interest him in a game 
of bridge with the neighbors, all 
through the evening. The neigh- 
bors were people he liked — Anne 
and Farley Dennerman. He had 
known them all their lives. But 
they were odd and brooding, too. 
this night and he barely listened 
to Dennerman’s complaints about 
not being able to get good phone 
service or his wife’s comments 
bn the disgusting variety of tele- 
vision commercials they had 
these days. 

Burckhardt was well on the 
way to setting an all-time record 
for continuous abstraction when, 
around midnight, with a sudden- 
ness that surprised him — he was 
strangely aware of it happening — 
he turned over in his bed and, 
quickly and completely, fell 
asleep. 

II 

O N the morning of June 15th, 
Burckhardt woke up scream- 
ing. 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




It was more real than any 
dream he had ever had in his life. 
He could still hear the explosion, 
feel the blast that crushed him 
against a wall. It did not seem 
right that he should be sitting 
bolt upright in bed in an undis- 
turbed room. 

His wife came pattering up 
the stairs. “Darling!” she cried. 
“What’s the matter?” 

He mumbled, “Nothing. Bad 
dream.” 

She relaxed, hand on heart. In 
an angry tone, she started to say; 
“You gave me such a shock — ” 

But a noise from outside inter- 
rupted her. There was a wail of 
sirens and a clang of bells; it was 
loud and shocking. 

The Burckhardts stared at each 
other for a heartbeat, then hur- 
ried fearfully to the window. 

There were no rumbling fire 
engines in the street, only a small 
panel truck, cruising slowly 
along. Flaring loudspeaker horns 
crowned its top. From them is- 
sued the screaming sound of si- 
rens, growing in intensity, mixed 
with the rumble of heavy-duty 
engines and the sound of bells. 
It was a perfect record of fire en- 
gines arriving at a four-alarm 
blaze. 

Burckhardt said in amaze- 
ment. “Mary, that’s against the 
law! Do you know what they’re 
doing? They’re playing records 
of a fire. What are they up to?” 



“Maybe it’s a practical joke,” 
his wife offered. 

“Joke? Waking up the whole 
neighborhood at six o’clock in 
the morning?” He shook his 
head. “The police will be here in 
ten minutes,” he predicted. “Wait 
and see.” 

But the police weren’t — not in 
ten minutes, or at all. Whoever 
the pranksters in the car were, 
they apparently had a police per- 
mit for their games. 

The car took a position in the 
middle of the block and stood si- 
lent for a few minutes. Then 
there was a crackle from the 
speaker, and a giant voice chant- 
ed: 

“Feckle Freezers! 

Feckle Freezers! 

Gotta have a 
Feckle Freezer! 

Feckle, Feckle, F'eckle, 
Feckle, Feckle, Feckle — ” 

It went on and on. Every house 
on the block had faces staring 
out of windows by then. The 
voice was not merely loud; it 
was nearly deafening. 

Burckhardt shouted to his wife, 
over the uproar, “What the hell 
is a Feckle Freezer?” 

“Some kind of a freezer, I 
guess, dear,” she shrieked back 
unhelpfully. 

A bruptly the noise stopped 
and the truck stood silent. 
It was still misty morning: the

Sun’s rays came horizontally 
across the rooftops. It was im- 
possible to believe that, a mo- 
ment ago, the silent block had 
been bellowing the name of a 
freezer. 

“A crazy advertising trick,” 
Burckhardt said bitterly. He 
yawned and turned away from 
the window. “Might as well get 
dressed. I guess that’s the end 
of — ” 

The bellow caught him from 
behind: it was almost like a hard 
slap on the ears. A harsh, sneer- 
ing voice, louder than the arch- 
angel’s trumpet, howled: 

“Have you got a freezer? It 
stinks! If it isn’t a Feckle Freezer, 
it stinks! If it’s a last year’s Fec- 
kle Freezer, it stinks! Only this 
year’s Feckle Freezer is any good 
at all! You know who owns an 
Ajax Freezer? Fairies own Ajax 
Freezers! You know who owns 
a Triplecold Freezer? Commies 
own Triplecold Freezers! Every 
freezer but a brand-new Feckle 
Freezer stinks!” 

The voice screamed inarticu- 
lately with rage. “I’m warning 
you! Get out and buy a Feckle 
Freezer right away! Hurry up! 
Hurry for Feckle! Hurry for Fec- 
kle! Hurry, hurry, hurry, Feckle, 
Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, 
Feckle . .” 

It stopped eventually. Burck- 
hardt licked his lips. He started 
to say to his wife, “Maybe we 



ought to call the police about — ” 
when the speakers erupted again. 
It caught him off guard: it was 
intended to catch him off guard. 
It screamed: 

“Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, 
Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle. 
Cheap freezers ruin your food. 
You’ll get sick and throw up. 
You’ll get sick and die. Buy a 
Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle! 
Ever take a piece of meat out of 
the freezer you’ve got and see 
how rotten and moldy it is? Buy 
a Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, Feckle, 
Feckle. Do you want to eat rot- 
ten, stinking food? Or do you 
want to wise up and buy a Feckle, 
Feckle, Feckle — ” 

That did it. With fingers that 
kept stabbing the wrong holes, 
Burckhardt finally managed to 
dial the local police station. He 
got a busy signal — it was ap- 
parent that he was not the only 
one with the same idea — and 
while he was shakingly dialing 
again, the noise outside stopped. 

He looked out the window. The 
truck was gone. 

T>URCKHARDT loosened his 
tie and ordered another 
Frosty-Flip from the waiter. If 
only they wouldn’t keep the Cry- 
stal Cafe so hot! The new paint 
job — searing reds and blinding 
yellows — was bad enough, but 
someone seemed to have the de- 
lusion that this was January in- 



THE TUNNEL UNDER THE 



WORLD

stead of June; the place was a 
good ten degrees warmer than 
outside. 

He swallowed the Frosty-Flip 
in two gulps. It had a kind of 
peculiar flavor, he thought, but 
not bad. It certainly cooled you 
off, just as the waiter had prom- 
ised. He reminded himself to pick 
up a carton of them on the way 
home; Mary might like them. 
She was always interested in 
something new. 

He stood up awkwardly as the 
girl came across the restaurant 
toward him. She was the most 
beautiful thing he had ever seen 
in Tylerton. Chin-height, honey- 
blonde hair and a figure that — 
well, it was all hers. There was 
no doubt in the world that the 
dress that clung to her was the 
only thing she wore. He felt as 
if he were blushing as she greet- 
ed him. 

“Mr. Burckhardt.” The voice 
was like distant tomtoms. “It’s 
wonderful of you to let me see 
you, after this morning.” 

He cleared his throat. “Not at 
all. Won’t you sit down. Miss — ” 
“April Horn,” she murmured, 
sitting down — beside him, not 
where he had pointed on the 
other side of the table. “Call me 
April, won’t you?” 

She was wearing some kind of 
perfume, Burckhardt noted with 
what little of his mind was func- 
tioning at all. It didn’t seem fair 



that she should be using perfume 
as well as everything else. He 
came to with a start and realized 
that the waiter was leaving with 
an order for filets mi^non for two. 

“Hey!” he objected. 

“Please, Mr. Burckhardt.” Her 
shoulder was against his, her face 
was turned to him, her breath 
was warm, her expression was 
tender and solicitous. “This is all 
on the Feckle Corporation. Please 
let them — it’s the hast they can 
do.” 

He felt her hand burrowing into 
his pocket. 

“I put the price of the meal 
into your pocket,” she whispered 
conspiratorially. “Please do that 
for me, won’t you? I mean I’d 
appreciate it if you’d pay the 
waiter — I’m old-fashioned about 
things like that.” 

She smiled meltingly, then be- 
came mock-businesslike. “But 
you must take the money,” she 
insisted. “Why, you’re letting 
Feckle off lightly if you do! You 
could sue them for every nickel 
they’ve got, disturbing your sleep 
like that.” 

W ITH a dizzy feeling, as 
though he had just seen 
someone make a rabbit disappear 
into a top hat, he said, “Why, it 
really wasn’t so bad, uh, April. 
A little noisy, maybe, but — ” 
“Oh, Mr. Burckhardt!” The 
blue eyes were wide and admir-

ing. “I knew you’d understand. 
It’s just that — well, it’s such a 
wonderful freezer that some of 
the outside men get carried away, 
so to speak. As soon as the main 
office found out about what hap- 
pened, they sent representatives 
around to every house on the 
block to apologize. Your wife 
told us where we could phone you 
— and I’m so very pleased that 
you were willing to let me have 
lunch with you, so that I could 
apologize, too. Because truly, Mr. 
Burckhardt, it is a fine freezer. 

“I shouldn’t tell you this, but 
— ” the blue eyes were shyly low- 
ered — “I’d do almost anything for 
Feckle Freezers. It’s more than a 
job to me.’’ She looked up. She 
was enchanting. “I bet you think 
I’m silly, don’t you?’’ 

Burckhardt coughed. “Well, 
I—’’ 

“Oh, you don’t want to be un- 
kind!’’ She shook her head. “No, 
don’t pretend. You think it’s silly. 
But really, Mr. Burckhardt, you 
wouldn’t think so if you knew 
more about the Feckle. Let me 
show you this little booklet — ” 

Burckhardt got back from 
lunch a full hour late. It wasn’t 
only the girl who delayed him. 
There had been a curious inter- 
view with a little man named 
Swanson, whom he barely knew, 
who had stopped him with des- 
perate urgency on the street — 
and then left him cold. 



But it didn’t matter much. Mr. 
Barth, for the first time since 
Burckhardt had worked there, 
was out for the day — leaving 
Burckhardt stuck with the quart- 
erly tax returns. 

What did matter, though, was 
that somehow he had signed a 
purchase order for a twelve- 
cubic-foot Feckle Freezer, up- 
right model, self-defrosting, list 
price $625, with a ten per cent 
“courtesy’’ discount — “Because 
of that horrid affair this morning, 
Mr. Burckhardt,’’ she had said. 

And he wasn’t sure how he 
could explain it to his wife. 

TTE NEEDN’T have worried. 

As he walked in the front 
door, his wife said almost imme- 
diately, “I wonder if we can’t af- 
ford a new freezer, dear. There 
was a man here to apologize about 
that noise and — well, we got to 
talking and — ’’ 

She had signed a purchase or- 
der, too. 

It had been the damnedest day, 
Burckhardt thought later, on his 
way up to bed. But the day 
wasn’t done with him yet. At the 
head of the stairs, the weakened 
spring in the electric light switch 
refused to click at all. He snapped 
it back and forth angrily and, of 
course, succeeded in jarring the 
tumbler out of its pins. The wires 
shorted and every light in the 
house went out. 



THE TUNNEL UNDER THE WORLD

“Damn!” said Guy Burck- 
hardt. 

“Fuse?” His wife shrugged 
sleepily. “Let it go till the morn- 
ing, dear.” 

Burckhardt shook his head. 
“You go back to bed. I’ll be 
right along.” 

It wasn’t so much that he cared 
about fixing the fuse, but he was 
too restless for sleep. He discon- 
nected the bad switch with a 
screwdriver, stumbled down into 
the black kitchen, found the flash- 
light and climbed gingerly down 
the cellar stairs. He located a 
spare fuse, pushed an empty 
trunk over to the fuse box to 
stand on and twisted out the old 
fuse. 

When the new one was in, he 
heard the starting click and 
steady drone of the refrigerator in 
the kitchen overhead. 

He headed back to the steps, 
and stopped. 

Where the old trunk had been, 
the cellar floor gleamed oddly 
bright. He inspected it in the 
flashlight beam. It was metal! 

“Son of a gun,” said Guy 
Burckhardt. He shook his head 
unbelievingly. He peered closer, 
rubbed the edges of the metallic 
patch with his thumb and ac- 
quired an annoying cut — the 
edges were sharp. 

The stained cement floor of the 
cellar was a thin shell. He found 
a hammer and cracked it off in 



a dozen spots— everywhere was 
metal. 

The whole cellar was a copper 
box. Even the cement-brick walls 
were false fronts over a metal 
sheath! 

T>AFFLED, he attacked one of 
^ the foundation beams. That, 
at least, was real wood. The glass 
in the cellar windows was real 
glass. 

He sucked his bleeding thumb 
and tried the base of the cellar 
stairs. Real wood. He chipped at 
the bricks under the oil burner. 
Real bricks. The retaining walls, 
the floor — they were faked. 

It was as though someone had 
shored up the house with a frame 
of metal and then laboriously 
concealed the evidence. 

The biggest surprise was the 
upside-down boat hull that 
blocked the rear half of the cel- 
lar, relic of a brief home work- 
shop period that Burckhardt had 
gone through a couple of years 
before. From above, it looked 
perfectly normal. Inside, though, 
where there should have been 
thwarts and seats and lockers, 
there was a mere tangle of braces, 
rough and unfinished. 

“But I built that!” Burckhardt 
exclaimed, forgetting his thumb. 
He leaned against the hull diz- 
zily, trying to think this thing 
through. For reasons beyond his 
comprehension, someone had 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




taken his boat and his cellar 
away, maybe his whole house, and 
replaced them with a clever 
mock-up of the real thing. 

“That’s crazy,” he said to the 
empty cellar. He stared around in 
the light of the flash. He whis- 
pered, “What in the name of 
Heaven would anybody do that 
for?” 

Reason refused an answer; 
there wasn’t any reasonable an- 
swer. For long minutes, Burck- 
hardt contemplated the uncer- 
tain picture of his own sanity. 

He peered under the boat 
again, hoping to reassure him- 
self that it was a mistake, just 
his imagination. But the sloppy, 
unfinished bracing was unchang- 
ed. He crawled under for a better 
look, feeling the rough wood in- 
credulously. Utterly impossible! 

He switched off the flashlight 
and started to wriggle out. But 
he didn’t make it. In the moment 
between the command to his legs 
to move and the crawling out, he 
felt a sudden draining weariness 
flooding through him. 

Consciousness went — not easi- 
ly, but as though it were being 
taken away, and Guy Burckhardt 
was asleep. 

Ill 

O N the morning of June 16th, 
Guy Burckhardt woke up in 
a cramped position huddled un- 



der the hull of the boat in his 
basement — and raced upstairs to 
find it was June 15th. 

The first thing he had done 
was to make a frantic, hasty in- 
spection of the boat hull, the 
faked cellar floor, the imitation 
stone. They were all as he had 
remembered them — all complete- 
ly unbelievable. 

The kitchen was its placid, un- 
exciting self. The electric clock 
was purring soberly around the 
dial. Almost six o’clock, it said. 
His wife would be waking at any 
moment. 

Burckhardt flung open the 
front door and stared out into the 
quiet street. The morning paper 
was tossed carelessly against the 
steps — and as he retrieved it, he 
noticed that this was the 15th 
day of June. 

But that was impossible, yes- 
terday was the 15th of June. It 
was not a date one would forget 
— it was quarterly tax-return day. 

He went back into the hall and 
picked up the telephone: he dial- 
ed for Weather Information, and 
got a well-modulated chant: “ — 
and cooler, some showers. Baro- 
metric pressure thirty point zero 
four, rising . United States 
Weather Bureau forecast for 
June 15th. Warm and sunny, with 
high around — ” 

He hung the phone up. June 
15th. 

“Holy heaven!” Burckhardt 



THE TUNNEL UNDER THE WORLD

said prayerfully. Things were 
very odd indeed. He heard the 
ring of his wife’s alarm and 
bounded up the stairs. 

Mary Burckhardt was sitting 
upright in bed with the terrified, 
uncomprehending stare of some- 
one just waking out of a night- 
mare. 

“Oh!” she gasped, as her hus- 
band came in the room. “Darling, 
I just had the most terrible 
dream! It was like an explosion 
and — ” 

“Again?” Burckhardt asked, 
not very sympathetically. “Mary, 
something’s funny! I knew there 
was something wrong all day 
yesterday and — ” 

He went on to tell her about 
the copper box that was the cel- 
lar, and the odd mock-up some- 
one had made of his boat. Mary 
looked astonished, then alarmed, 
then placatory and uneasy. 

She said, “Dear, are you sure? 
Because I was cleaning that old 
trunk out just last week and I 
didn’t notice anything.” 

“Positive!” said Guy Burck- 
hardt. “I dragged it over to the 
wall to step on it to put a new 
fuse in after we blew the lights 
out and — ” 

“After we what?” Mary was 
looking more than merely alarm- 
ed. 

“After we blew the lights out. 
You know, when the switch at the 
head of the stairs stuck. I went 



down to the cellar and — ” 

Mary sat up in bed. “Guy, the 
switch didn’t stick. I turned out 
the lights myself last night.” 
Burckhardt glared at his wife. 
“Now I know you didn’t! Come 
here and take a look!” 

He stalked out to the landing 
and dramatically pointed to the 
bad switch, the one that he had 
unscrewed and left hanging the 
night before . 

Only it wasn’t. It was as it had 
always been. Unbelieving, Burck- 
hardt pressed it and the lights 
sprang up in both halls. 

Tl^ARY, looking pale and wor- 
ried, left him to go down to 
the kitchen and start breakfast. 
Burckhardt stood staring at the 
switch for a long time. His mental 
processes were gone beyond the 
point of disbelief and shock; 
they simply were not functioning. 

He shaved and dressed and ate 
his breakfast in a state of numb 
introspection. Mary didn’t dis- 
turb him; she was apprehensive 
and soothing. She kissed him 
good-by as he hurried out to the 
bus without another word. 

Miss Mitkin, at the reception 
desk, greeted him with a yawn. 
“Morning,” she said drowsily. 
“Mr. Barth won’t be in today.” 
Burckhardt started to say 
something, but checked himself. 
She would not know that Barth 
hadn’t been in yesterday, either. 



20

because she was tearing a June 
14th pad off her calendar to make 
way for the “new” June 15th 
sheet. 

He staggered to his own desk 
and stared unseeingly at the 
morning’s mail. It had not even 
been opened yet, but he knew 
that the Factory Distributors en- 
velope contained an order for 
twenty thousand feet of the new 
acoustic tile, and the one from 
Finebeck & Sons was a com- 
plaint. 

After a long while, he forced 
himself to open them. They were. 

By lunchtime, driven by a 
desperate sense of urgency, 
Burckhardt made Miss Mitkin 
take her lunch hour first — the 
June - fifteenth - that - was - yester - 
day, he had gone first. She went, 
looking vaguely worried about 
his strained insistence, but it 
made no difference to Burck- 
hardt’s mood. 

The phone rang and Burck- 
hardt picked it up abstractedly. 
“Contro Chemicals Downtown, 
Burckhardt speaking.” 

The voice said, “This is Swan- 
son,” and stopped. 

Burckhardt waited expectant- 
ly, but that was all. He said, 
“Hello?” 

Again the pause. Then Swan- 
son asked in sad resignation, 
“Still nothing, eh?” 

“Nothing what? Swanson, is 
there something you want? You 



came up to me yesterday and 
went through this routine. You — ” 
The voice crackled: “Burck- 
hardt! Oh, my good heavens, you 
remember! Stay right there — I’ll 
be down in half an hour!” 
“What’s this all about?” 
“Never mind,” the little man 
said exultantly. “Tell you about 
it when I see you. Don’t say any 
more over the phone — somebody 
may be listening. Just wait there. 
Say, hold on a minute. Will you 
be alone in the office?” 

“Well, no. Miss Mitkin will 
probably — ” 

“Hell. Look, Burckhardt, where 
do you eat lunch? Is it good and 
noisy?” 

“Why. I suppose so. The Crys- 
tal Cafe. It’s just about a 
block — ” 

“I know where it is. Meet you 
in half an hour!” And the re- 
ceiver clicked. 

^T^HE . Crystal Cafe was no 
longer painted red, but the 
temperature was still up. And 
they had added piped-in music 
interspersed with commercials. 
The advertisements were for 
Frosty-Flip, Marlin Cigarettes — 
“They’re sanitized,” the an- 
nouncer purred — and something 
called Choco-Bite candy bars 
that Burckhardt couldn’t remem- 
ber ever having heard of before. 
But he heard more about them 
quickly enough. 



THE TUNNEL UNDER THE 



WORLD 



21 




While he was waiting for Swan- 
son to show up, a girl in the 
cellophane, skirt of a nightclub 
cigarette vendor came, through 
the restaurant with a tray of tiny 
scarlet-wrapped candies. 

“Choco-Bites are taniy,” she 
was murmuring as she came close 
to his table. “Choco-Bites are 
tan^ier than tangy!” 

Burckhardt, intent on watching 
for the strange little man who 
had phoned him, paid little at- 
tention. But as she scattered a 
handful of the confections over 
the table next to his, smiling at 
the occupants, he caught a 
glimpse of her and turned to 
stare. 

“Why, Miss Horn!’’ he said. 

The girl dropped her tray of 
candies. 

Burckhardt rose, concerned 
over the girl. “Is something 
wrong?” 

But she fled. 

The manager of the restaurant 
was staring suspiciously at 
Burckhardt, who sank back in his 
seat and tried to look incon- 
spicuous. He hadn’t insulted the 
girl! Maybe she was just a very 
strictly reared young lady, he 
thought — in spite of the long bare 
legs under the cellophane skirt — 
and when he addressed her, she 
thought he was a masher. 

Ridiculous idea. Burckhardt 
scowled uneasily and picked up 
his menu. 



“Burckhardt!” It was a shrill 
whisper. 

Burckhardt looked up over the 
top of his menu, startled. In the 
seat across from him, the little 
man named Swanson was sitting, 
tensely poised. 

“Buckhardt!” the little man 
v/hispered again. “Let’s get out of 
here! They’re on to you now. If 
you want to stay alive, come on!” 

There was no arguing with the 
man. Burckhardt gave the hover- 
ing manager a sick, apologetic 
smile and followed Swanson out. 
The little man seemed to know 
where he was going. In the street, 
he clutched Burckhardt by the 
elbow and hurried him off down 
the block. 

“Did you see her?” he de- 
manded. “That Horn woman, in 
the phone booth? She’ll have 
them here in five minutes, be- 
lieve me, so hurry it up!” 

A lthough the street was 
full of people and cars, no- 
body was paying any attention 
to Burckhardt and Swanson. The 
air had a nip in it — more like 
October than June, Burckhardt 
thought, in spite of the weather 
bureau. And he felt like a fool, 
following this mad little man 
down the street, running away 
from some “them” toward — to- 
ward what? The little man might 
be crazy, but he was afraid. And 
the fear was infectious. 



22

“In here!” panted the little 
man. 

It was another restaurant — 
more of a bar, really, and a sort 
of second-rate place that Burck- 
hardt had never patroni2ed. 

“Right straight through.” 
Swanson whispered; and Burck- 
hardt, like a biddable boy, side- 
stepped through the mass of 
tables to the far end of the restau- 
rant. 

It was “L”-shaped, with a front 
on two streets at right angles to 
each other. They came out on 
the side street, Swanson staring 
coldly back at the question-look- 
ing cashier, and crossed to the op- 
posite sidewalk. 

They were under the marquee 
of a movie theater. Swanson’s 
expression began to relax. 

“Lost them!” he crowed softly. 
“We’re almost there.” 

He stepped up to the window 
and bought two tickets. Burck- 
hardt trailed him in to the 
theater. It was a weekday mati- 
nee and the place was almost 
empty. From the screen came 
sounds of gunfire and horse’s 
hoofs. A solitary usher, leaning 
against a bright brass rail, looked 
briefly at them and went back to 
staring boredly at the picture as 
Swanson led Burckhardt down a 
flight of carpeted marble steps. 

They were in the lounge and 
it was empty. There was a door 
for men and one for ladies; and 



there was a third door, marked 
“MANAGER” in gold letters. 
Swanson listened at the door, and 
gently opened it and peered in- 
side. 

“Okay,” he said, gesturing. 

Burckhardt followed him 
through an empty office, to an- 
other door — a closet, probably, 
because it was unmarked. 

But it was no closet. Swanson 
opened it warily, looked inside, 
then motioned Burckhardt to fol- 
low. 

It was a tunnel, metal-walled, 
brigntly lit. Empty, it stretched 
vacantly away in both directions 
from them. 

Burckhardt looked wondering 
around. One thing he knew and 
knew full well: 

No such tunnel belonged under 
Tylerton. 

T here was a room off the 
tunnel with chairs and a desk 
and what looked like television 
screens. Swanson slumped in a 
chair, panting. 

“We’re all right for a while 
here,” he wheezed. “They don’t 
come here much any more. If 
they do, we’ll hear them and we 
can hide.” 

“Who?”demanded Burckhardt. 
The little man said, “Mar- 
tians!” His voice cracked on the 
word and the life seemed to go 
out of him. In morose tones, he 
went on: “Well, I think they’re 



THE TUNNEL UNDER THE WORLD

Martians. Although you could be 
right, you know; I’ve had plenty 
of time to think it over these last 
few weeks, after they got you, and 
it’s possible they’re Russians 
after all. Still — ” 

“Start from the beginning. 
Who got me when?’’ 

Swanson sighed. “So we have 
to go through the whole thing 
again. All right. It was about two 
months ago that you banged on 
my door, late at night. You 
were all beat up— scared silly. 
You begged’ me to help you — ’’ 

“/ did?’’ 

“Naturally you don’t remem- 
ber any of this. Listen and you’ll 
understand. You were talking a 
blue streak about being captured 
and threatened, and your wife 
being dead and coming back to 
life, and all kinds of mixed-up 
nonsense. I thought you were 
crazy. But — well, I’ve always had 
a lot of respect for you. And you 
begged me to hide you and I 
have this darkroom, you know. 
It locks from the inside only. I 
put the lock on myself. So we 
went in there — just to humor you 
— and along about midnight, 
which was only fifteen or twenty 
minutes after, we passed out.’’ 
“Passed out?’’ 

Swanson nodded. “Both of us. 
It was like being hit with a 
sandbag. Look, didn’t that hap- 
pen to you again last night?’’ 

“I guess it did,’’ Burckhardt 



shook his head uncertainly. 

“Sure. And then all of a sud- 
den we were awake again, and 
you said you were going to show 
me something funny, and we went 
out and bought a paper. And the 
date on it was June 15th.” 

“June 15th? But that’s today! 
I mean — ” 

“You got it, friend. It’s always 
today!” 

It took time to penetrate. 

Burckhardt said wonderingly, 
“You’ve hidden out in that dark- 
room for how many weeks?” 

“How can I tell? Four or five, 
maybe. I lost count. And every 
day the same — always the 15th of 
June, always my landlady, Mrs. 
Keefer, is sweeping the front 
steps, always the same headline 
in the papers at the corner. It 
gets monotonous, friend.” 

IV 

I T was Burckhardt’s idea and 
Swanson despised it, but he 
went along. He was the type who 
always went along. 

“It’s dangerous,” he grumbled 
worriedly. “Suppose somebody 
comes by? They’ll spot us and — ” 
“What have we got to lose?” 
Swanson shrugged. “It’s dan- 
gerous,” he said again. But he 
went along. 

Burckhardt’s idea was very 
simple. He was sure of only one 
thing — the tunnel went some-

where. Martians or Russians, 
fantastic plot or crazy hallucina- 
tion, whatever was wrong with 
Tylerton had an explanation, and 
the place to look for it was at 
the end of the tunnel. 

They jogged along. It was more 
than a mile before they began to 
see an end. They were in luck — 
at least no one came through the 
tunnel to spot them. But Swan- 
son had said that it was only at 
certain hours that the tunnel 
seemed to be in use. 

Always the fifteenth of June. 
Why? Burckhardt asked himself. 
Never mind the how. Why? 

And falling asleep, completely 
involuntarily — everyone at the 
same time, it seemed. And not 
remembering, never remembering 
anything — Swanson had said how 
eagerly he saw Burckhardt 
again, the morning after Burck- 
hardt had incautiously waited 
five minutes too many before re- 
treating into the darkroom. When 
Swanson had come to, Burck- 
hardt was gone. Swanson had 
seen him in the street that after- 
noon, but Burckhardt had re- 
membered nothing. 

And Swanson had lived his 
mouse’s existence for weeks, hid- 
ing in the woodwork at night, 
stealing out by day to search for 
Burckhardt in pitiful hope, scur- 
rying around the fringe of life, 
trying to keep from the deadly 
eyes of them. 



Them. One of “them” was the 
girl named April Horn. It was by 
seeing her walk carelessly into a 
telephone booth and never come 
out that Swanson had found the 
tunnel. Another was the man at 
the cigar stand in Burckhardt’s 
office building. There were more, 
at least a dozen that Swanson 
knew of or suspected. 

They were easy enough to spot, 
once you knew where to look — for 
they, alone in Tylerton, changed 
their roles from day to day. 
Burckhardt was on that 8:51 bus, 
every morning of every day-that- 
was-June-15th, never different by 
a hair or a moment. But April 
Horn was sometimes gaudy in 
the cellophane skirt, giving away 
candy or cigarettes; sometimes 
plainly dressed; sometimes not 
seen by Swanson at all. 

Russians? Martians? Whatever 
they were, what could they be 
hoping to gain from this mad 
masquerade? 

Burckhardt didn’t know the 
answer — but perhaps it lay be- 
yond the door at the end of the 
tunnel. They listened carefully 
and heard distant sounds that 
could not quite be made out, but 
nothing that seemed dangerous. 
They slipped through. 

And, through a wide chamber 
and up a flight of steps, they 
found they were in what Burck- 
hardt recognized as the Contro 
Chemicals plant. 



THE TUNNEL UNDER THE WORLD 



35 




N obody was in sight. By it- 
self, that was not so very odd 
— the automatized factory had 
never had very many persons in 
it. But Burckhardt remembered, 
from his single visit, the endless, 
ceaseless busyness of the plant, 
the valves that opened and 
closed, the vats that emptied 
themselves and filled themselves 
and stirred and cooked and chem- 
ically tasted the bubbling liquids 
they held inside themselves. The 
plant was never populated, but 
it was never still. 

Only — now it was still. Except 
for the distant sounds, there was 
no breath of life in it. The captive 
electronic minds were sending out 
no commands; the coils and re- 
lays were at rest. 

Burckhardt said, “Come on.” 
Swanson reluctantly followed 
him through the tangled aisles of 
stainless steel columns and tanks. 

They walked as though they 
were in the presence of the dead. 
In a way, they were, for what 
were the automatons that once 
had run the factory, if not 
corpses? The machines were con- 
trolled by computers that were 
really not computers at all, but 
the electronic analogues of living 
brains. And if they were turned 
off, were they not dead? For each 
had once been a human mind. 

Take a master petroleum 
chemist, infinitely skilled in the 
separation of crude oil into its 



fractions. Strap him down, probe 
into his brain with searching elec- 
tronic needles. The machine 
scans the patterns of the mind, 
translates what it sees into charts 
and sine waves. Impress these 
same waves on a robot com- 
puter and you have your chemist. 
Or a thousand copies of your 
chemist, if you wish, with all of 
his knowledge and skill, and no 
human limitations at all. 

Put a dozen copies of him into 
a plant and they will run it all, 
twenty-four hours a day, seven 
days of every week, never tiring, 
never overlooking anything, never 
forgetting . 

Swanson stepped up closer to 
Burckhardt. “I’m scared,” he 
said. 

They were across the room 
now and the sounds were louder. 
They were not machine sounds, 
but voices ; Burckhardt moved 
cautiously up to a door and 
dared to peer around it. 

It was a smaller room, lined 
with television screens, each one 
— a dozen or more, at least — ^with 
a man or woman sitting before it, 
staring into the screen and dic- 
tating notes into a recorder. The 
viewers dialed from scene to 
scene : no two screens ever showed 
the same picture. 

The pictures seemed to have 
little in common. One was a store, 
where a girl dressed like April 
Horn was demonstrating home

freezers. One was a series of shots 
of kitchens. Burckhardt caught a 
glimpse of what looked like the 
cigar stand in his office building. 

It was baffling and Burck- 
hardt would have loved to stand 
there and puzzle it out, but it was 
too busy a place. There was the 
chance that someone would look 
their way or walk out and find 
them. 

^^HEY found another room. 

This one was empty. It was 
an office, large and sumptuous. 
It had a desk, littered with pa- 
pers. Burckhardt stared at them, 
briefly at first — then, as the words 
on one of them caught his atten- 
tion, with incredulous fascination. 

He snatched up the topmost 
sheet, scanned it, and another, 
while Swanson was frenziedly 
searching through the drawers. 

Burckhardt swore unbelieving- 
ly and dropped the papers to the 
desk. 

Swanson, hardly noticing, yelp- 
ed with delight: “Look!” He 

dragged a gun from the desk. 
“And it’s loaded, tool” 

Burckhardt stared at him 
blankly, trying to assimilate 
what he had read. Then, as he 
realized what Swanson had 
said, Burckhardt’s eyes sparked. 
“Good man!” he cried. “We’ll 
take it. We’re getting out of here 
with that gun, Swanson. And 
we’re going to the police! Not the 



cops in Tylerton, but the F.B.I., 
maybe. Take a look at this!” 

The sheaf he handed Swanson 
was headed: “Test Area Progress 
Report. Subject: Marlin Ciga- 
rettes Campaign.” It was mostly 
tabulated figures that made little 
sense to Burckhardt and Swan- 
son. but at the end was a sum- 
mary that said: 

Although Test 47-K3 pulled 
nearly double the number of new 
users of any of the other tests 
conducted, it probably cannot be 
used in the field because of local 
sound-truck control ordinances. 

The tests in the 47-K12 group 
were second best and our recom- 
mendation is that retests be con- 
ducted in this appeal, testing each 
of the three best campaigns with 
and without the addition of sam- 
pling techniques. 

An alternative suggestion might 
be to proceed directly with the top 
appeal in the K12 series, if the 
client is unwilling to go to the ex- 
pense of additional tests. 

All of these forecast expectations 
have an 80% probability of being 
within one-half of one per cent of 
results forecast, and more than 99% 
probability of coming within 5%c. 

Swanson looked up from the 
paper into Burckhardt’s eyes. “I 
don’t get it.” he complained. 

Burckhardt said, “I don’t 
blame you. It’s crazy, but it fits 
the facts, Swanson, it fits the 
iacts. They aren’t Russians and 
they aren’t Martians. These peo- 
ple are advertising men! Some-

how — heaven knows how they did 
it — they’ve taken Tylerton over. 
They’ve got us, all of us, you 
and me and twenty or thirty 
thousand other people, right un- 
der their thumbs. 

“Maybe they hypnotize us and 
maybe it’s something else: but 
however they do it. what happens 
is that they let us live a day at a 
time. They pour advertising into 
us the whole damned day long. 
And at the end of the day, they 
see what happened — and then 
they wash the day out of our 
minds and start again the next 
day with different advertising.” 

S WANSON’S jaw was hanging. 

He managed to close it and 
swallow. “Nuts!” he said flatly. 

Burckhardt shook his head. 
“Sure, it sounds crazy — but this 
whole thing is crazy. How else 
would you explain it? You can’t 
deny that most of Tylerton lives 
the same day over and over 
again. You’ve seen it! And that’s 
the crazy part and we have to 
admit that that’s true — unless we 
are the crazy ones. And once you 
admit that somebody, somehow, 
knows how to accomplish that, 
the rest of it makes all kinds of 
sense. 

“Think of it, Swanson! They 
test every last detail before they 
spend a nickel on advertising! Do 
you have any idea what that 
means? Lord knows how much 



money is involved, but I know 
for a fact that some companies 
spend twenty or thirty million 
dollars a year on advertising. 
Multiply it, say, by a hundred 
companies. Say that every one of 
them learns how to cut its adver- 
tising cost by only ten per cent. 
And that’s peanuts, believe me! 

“If they know in advance 
what’s going to work, they can 
cut their costs in half — maybe to 
less than half, I don’t know. But 
that’s saving two or three hun- 
dred million dollars a year — and 
if they pay only ten or twenty 
per cent of that for the use of 
Tylerton, it’s still dirt cheap for 
them and a fortune for whoever 
took over Tylerton.” 

Swanson licked his lips. “You 
mean,” he offered hesitantly, 
“that we’re a — well, a kind of 
captive audience?” 

Burckhardt frowned. “Not ex- 
actly.” He thought for a minute. 
“You know how a doctor tests 
something like penicillin? He sets 
up a series of little colonies of 
germs on gelatine disks and he 
tries the stuff on one after an- 
other, changing it a little each 
time. Well, that’s us — we’re the 
germs, Swanson. Only it’s even 
more efficient than that. They 
don’t have to test more than one 
colony, because they can use it 
over and over again.” 

It was too hard for Swanson 
to take in. He only said: “What 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




do we do about it?” 

‘‘We go to the police. They 
can’t use human beings for guinea 
pigs!” 

‘‘How do we get to the police?” 
Burckhardt hesitated. ‘‘I think 
— ” he began slowly. ‘‘Sure. This 
place is the office of somebody 
important. We’ve got a gun. We’ll 
stay right here until he comes 
along. And he’ll get us out of 
here.” 

Simple and direct. Swanson 
subsided and found a place to 
sit, against the wall, out of sight 
of the door. Burckhardt took up 
a position behind the door itself — 
And waited. 

^T^HE wait was not as long as it 
might have been. Half an 
hour, perhaps. Then Burckhardt 
heard approaching voices and had 
time for a swift whisper to Swan- 
son before he flattened himself 
against the wall. 

It was a man’s voice, and a 
girl’s. The man was saying, ‘‘ — 
reason why you couldn’t report 
on the phone? You’re ruining 
your whole day’s test! What the 
devil’s the matter with you, 
Janet?” 

‘‘I’m sorry, Mr. Dorchin,” she 
said in a sweet, clear tone. ‘‘I 
thought it was important.” 

The man grumbled, ‘‘Impor- 
tant! One lousy unit out of twen- 
ty-one thousand.” 

‘‘But it’s the Burckhardt one, 



Mr. Dorchin. Again. And the way 
he got out of sight, he must 
have had some help.” 

‘‘All right, all right. It doesn’t 
matter, Janet; the Choco-Bite 
program is ahead of schedule 
anyhow. As long as you’re this 
far, come on in the office and 
make out your worksheet. And 
don’t worry about the Burck- 
hardt business. He’s probably 
just wandering around. We’ll pick 
him up tonight and — ” 

They were inside the door. 
Burckhardt kicked it shut and 
pointed the gun. 

‘‘That’s what you think.” he 
said triumphantly. 

It was worth the terrified 
hours, the bewildered sense of 
insanity, the confusion and fear. 
It was the most satisfying sensa- 
tion Burckhardt had ever had in 
his life. The expression on the 
man’s face was one he had read 
about but never actually seen: 
Dorchin’s mouth fell open and his 
eyes went wide, and though he 
managed to make a sound that 
might have been a question, it 
was not in words. 

The girl was almost as sur- 
prised. And Burckhardt, looking 
at her, knew why her voice had 
been so familiar. The girl was the 
one who had introduced herself 
to him as April Horn. 

Dorchin recovered himself 
quickly. ‘‘Is this the one?” he 
asked sharply. 



THE TUNNEL UNDER THE 



WORLD 



29 




The girl said, “Yes.” 

Dorchin nodded, “I take it 
back. You were right. Uh, you — 
Burckhardt. What do you want?” 

OWANSON piped up, “Watch 
^ him! He might have another 
gun.” 

“Search him then.” Burckhardt 
said. “I’ll tell you what we want. 
Dorchin. We want you to come 
along with us to the FBI and 
explain to them how you can get 
away with kidnaping twenty 
thousand people.” 

“Kidnaping?” Dorchin snorted. 
“That’s ridiculous, man! Put that 
gun away — you can’t get away 
with this!” 

Burckhardt hefted the gun 
grimly. “I think I can.” 

Dorchin looked furious and 
sick — but, oddly, not afraid. 
“Damn it — ” he started to bellow, 
then closed his mouth and swal- 
lowed. “Listen.” he said per- 
suasively. “you’re making a big 
mistake. I haven’t kidnaped any- 
body, believe me!” 

“I don’t believe you,” said 
Burckhardt bluntly. “Why should 
I?” 

“But it’s true! Take my word 
for it!” 

Burckhardt shook his head. 
“The FBI can take your word if 
they like. We’ll find out. Now 
how do we get out of here?” 
Dorchin opened his mouth to 
argue. 



Burckhardt bla2ed: “Don’t get 
in my way! I’m willing to kill 
you if I have to. Don’t you un- 
derstand that? I’ve gone through 
two days of hell and every sec- 
ond of it I blame on you. Kill 
you? It would be a pleasure and 
I don’t have a thing in the world 
to lose! Get us out of here!” 

Dorchin’s face went suddenly 
opaque. He seemed about to 
move; but the blonde girl he had 
called Janet slipped between him 
and the gun. 

“Please!” she begged Burck- 
hardt. “You don’t understand. 
You mustn’t shoot!” 

“Get out of my way!" 

“But, Mr. Burckhardt — ” 

She never finished. Dorchin, 
his face unreadable, headed for 
the door. Burckhardt had been 
pushed one degree too far. He 
swung the gun, bellowing. The 
girl called out sharply. He pulled 
the trigger. Closing on him with 
pity and pleading in her eyes, she 
came again between the gun and 
the man. 

Burckhardt aimed low instinc- 
tively, to cripple, not to kill. But 
his aim was not good. 

The pistol bullet caught her in 
the pit of the stomach. 

T^ORCHIN was out and away, 
the door slamming behind 
him, his footsteps racing into the 
distance. 

Burckhardt hurled the gun 



30 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




across the room and jumped to 
the girl. 

Swanson was moaning, “That 
finishes us, Burckhardt. Oh, why 
did you do it? We could have 
got away. We could have gone to 
the police. We were practically 
out of here! We — ” 

Burckhardt wasn’t listening. He 
was kneeling beside the girl. She 
lay flat on her back, arms helter- 
skelter. There was no blood, 
hardly any sign of the wound: 
but the position in which she lay 
was one that no living human 
being could have held. 

Yet she wasn’t dead. 

She wasn’t dead — and Burck- 
hardt, frozen beside her, thought; 
She isn't alive, either. 

There was no pulse, but there 
was a rhythmic ticking of the 
outstretched fingers of one hand. 

There was no sound of breath- 
ing, but there was a hissing, 
sizzling noise. 

The eyes were open and they 
were looking at Burckhardt. 
There was neither fear nor pain 
in them, only a pity deeper thjan 
the Pit. 

She said, through lips that 
writhed erratically, “Don't — 
worry, Mr. Burckhardt. I'm — all 
right.’’ 

Burckhardt rocked back on his 
haunches, staring. Where there 
should have been blood, there 
was a clean break of a substance 
that was not flesh; and a curl of 



thin golden-copper wire. 

Burckhardt moistened his lips. 
“You’re a robot,’’ he said. 

The girl tried to nod. The 
twitching lips said, “I am. And 
so are you.’’ 

V 

S WANSON, after a single in- 
articulate sound, walked over 
to the desk and sat staring at the 
wall. Burckhardt rocked back and 
forth beside the shattered puppet 
on the floor. He had no words. 

The girl managed to say, “I’m 
— sorry all this happened.” The 
lovely lips twisted into a rictus 
sneer, frightening on that smooth 
young face, until she got them 
under control. “Sorry.” she said 
again. “The — nerve center was 
right about where the bullet hit. 
Makes it difficult to— control this 
body.” 

Burckhardt nodded automatic- 
ally. accepting the apology. Ro- 
bots. It was obvious, now that he 
knew it. In hindsight, it was in- 
evitable. He thought of his mys- 
tic notions of hypnosis or Mar- 
tians or something stranger still 
— idiotic, for the simple fact of 
created robots fitted the facts 
better and more economically. 

All the evidence had been be- 
fore him. The automatized fac- 
tory, with its transplanted minds 
— why not transplant a mind into 
a humanoid robot, give it its

original owner’s features and 
form? 

Could it know that it was a 
robot? 

“All of us,” Burckhardt said, 
hardly aware that he spoke out 
loud. “My wife and my secretary 
and you and the neighbors. All 
of us the same.” 

“No.” The voice was stronger. 
“Not exactly the same, all of us. 
I chose it, you see. I — ” this time 
the convulsed lips were not a 
random contortion of the nerves 
— “I was an ugly woman, Mr. 
Burckhardt. and nearly sixty 
years old. Life had passed me. 
And when Mr. Dorchin offered 
me the chance to live again as a 
beautiful girl, I jumped at the 
opportunity. Believe me, I jump- 
ed, in spite of its disadvantages. 
My flesh body is still alive — it is 
sleeping, while I am here. I could 
go back to it. But I never do.’’ 

“And the rest of us?” 

“Different, Mr. Burckhardt. I 
work here. I’m carrying out Mr. 
Dorchin’s orders, mapping the re- 
sults of the advertising tests, 
watching you and the others 
live as he makes you live. I do 
it by choice, but you have no 
choice. Because, you see, you are 
dead.’’ 

“Dead?’’ cried Burckhardt; it 
was almost a scream. 

The blue eyes looked at him 
unwinkingly and he knew that it 
was no lie. He swallowed, mar- 



veling at the intricate mechan- 
isms that let him swallow, and 
sweat, and eat. 

He said: “Oh. -The explosion 
in my dream.’’ 

“It was no dream. You are 
right — the explosion. That was 
real and this plant was the cause 
of it. The storage tanks let go 
and what the blast didn’t get, the 
fumes killed a little later. But 
almost everyone died in the blast, 
twenty-one thousand persons. 
You died with them and that was 
Dorchin’s chance.’’ 

“The damned ghoul!” said 
Burckhardt. 

T he twisted shoulders shrug- 
ged with an odd grace. “Why? 
You were gone. And you and all 
the others were what Dorchin 
wanted — a whole town, a perfect 
slice of America. It’s as easy to 
transfer a pattern from a dead 
brain as a living one. Easier — the 
dead can’t say no. Oh, it took 
work and money — the town was 
a wreck — but it was possible to 
rebuild it entirely, especially be- 
cause it wasn’t necessary to have 
all the details exact. 

“There were the homes where 
even the brains had been utterly 
destroyed, and those are empty 
inside, and the cellars that needn’t 
be too perfect, and the streets that 
hardly matter. And anyway, it 
only has to last for one day. The 
same day — June 15th — over and 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




over again; and if someone finds 
something a little wrong, some- 
how, the discovery won’t have 
time to snowball, wreck the valid- 
ity of the tests, because all 
errors are canceled out at mid- 
night.” 

The face tried to smile. “That’s 
the dream, Mr. Burckhardt, that 
day of June 15th, because you 
never really lived it. It’s a present 
from Mr. Dorchin, a dream that 
he gives you and then takes back 
at the end of the day, when he 
has all his figures on how many 
of you responded to what varia- 
tion of which appeal, and the 
maintenance crews go down the 
tunnel to go through the whole 
city, washing out the new dream 
with their little electronic drains, 
and then the dream starts all 
over again. On June 15th. 

“Always June 15th, because 
June 14th is the last day any of 
you can remember alive. Some- 
times the crews miss someone — 
as they missed you, because you 
were under your boat. But it 
doesn’t matter. The ones who are 
missed give themselves away if 
they show it — and if they don’t, 
it doesn’t affect the test. But they 
don’t drain us, the ones of us 
who work for Dorchin. We sleep 
when the power is turned off, 
just as you do. When we wake 
up, though, we remember.” The 
face contorted wildly. “If I could 
only forget!” 



Burckhardt said unbelievingly, 
“All this to sell merchandise! It 
must have cost millions!” 

The robot called April Horn 
said, “It did. But it has made 
millions for Dorchin, too. And 
that’s not the end of it. Once he 
finds the master words that make 
people act, do you suppose he 
will stop with that? Do you sup- 
pose — ” 

The door opened, interrupting 
her. Burckhardt whirled. Belated- 
ly remembering Dorchin’s flight, 
he raised the gun. 

“Don’t shoot,” ordered the 
voice calmly. It was not Dorchin; 
it was another robot, this one 
not disguised with the clever 
plastics and cosmetics, but shin- 
ing plain. It said metallically: 
“Forget it, Burckhardt. You’re 
not accomplishing anything. Give 
me that gun before you do any 
more damage. Give it to me now.” 

|>URCKHARDT bellowed an- 
^ grily. The gleam on this ro- 
bot torso was steel; Burckhardt 
was not at all sure that his bullets 
would pierce it, or do much harm 
if they did. He would have put 
it to the test — 

But from behind him came a 
whimpering, scurrying whirl- 
wind; its name was Swanson, 
hysterical with fear. He cata- 
pulted into Burckhardt and sent 
him sprawling, the gun flying 
free. 



THE TUNNEL UNDER THE WORLD 



33 




“Pleasel” begged Swanson in- 
coherently, prostrate before the 
steel robot. “He would have shot 
you — please don’t hurt me! Let 
me work for you, like that girl, 
ril do anything, anything you 
tell me — ” 

The robot voice said. “We don’t 
need your help.” It took two 
precise steps and stood over the 
gun — and spurned it, left it lying 
on the floor 

The wrecked blonde robot said, 
without emotion, “I doubt that I 
can hold out much longer, Mr. 
Dorchin.” 

“Disconnect if you have to,” 
replied the steel robot. 

Burckhardt blinked. “But 
you’re not Dorchin!” 

The steel robot turned deep 
eyes on him. “I am,” it said. “Not 
in the flesh — but this is the body 
I am using at the moment. I 
doubt that you can damage this 
one with the gun. The other ro- 
bot body was more vulnerable. 
Now will you stop this nonsense? 
I don’t want to have to damage 
you; you’re too expensive for 
that. Will you just sit down and 
let the maintenance crews adjust 
you?” 

Swanson groveled. “You — you 
won’t punish us?” 

The steel robot had no expres- 
sion, but its voice was almost 
surprised. “Punish you?” it re- 
peated on a rising note. “How?” 

Swanson quivered as though 



the word had been a whip; but 
Burckhardt flared: “Adjust him, 
if he’ll let you — but not me! 
You're going to have to do me a 
lot of damage, Dorchin. I don’t 
care what I cost or how much 
trouble it’s going to be to put me 
back together again. But I’m go- 
ing out of that door! If you want 
to stop me, you’ll have to kill me. 
‘You won’t stop me any other 
way!” 

The steel robot took a half- 
step toward him, and Burckhardt 
involuntarily checked his stride. 
He stood poised and shaking, 
ready for death, ready for at- 
tack, ready for anything that 
might happen. 

Ready for anything except 
what did happen. For Dorchin’s 
steel body merely stepped aside, 
between Burckhardt and the gun, 
but leaving the door free. 

“Go ahead,” invited the steel 
robot. “Nobody’s stopping you.” 

/“WUTSIDE the door, Burck- 
hardt brought up sharp. It 
was insane of Dorchin to let him 
go! Robot or flesh, victim or bene- 
ficiary, there was nothing to stop 
him from going to the FBI or 
whatever law he could find away 
from Dorchin’s synthetic empire, 
and telling his story. Surely the 
corporations who paid Dorchin 
for test results had no notion of 
the ghoul’s technique he used; 
Dorchin would have to keep it

from them, for the breatii of 
publicity would put a stop to it. 
Walking out meant death, per- 
haps — ^but at that moment in his 
pseudo-life, death was no terror 
for Burckhardt. 

There was no one in the cor- 
ridor. He found a window and 
stared out of it. There was Tyler- 
ton-— an ersatz city, but looking 
so real and familiar that Burck- 
hardt almost imagined the whole 
episode a dream. It was no dream, 
though. He was certain of that 
in his heart and equally certain 
that nothing in Tylerton could 
help him now. 

It had to be the other direction. 

It took him a quarter of an 
hour to find a way, but he found 
it — skulking through the corri- 
dors, dodging the suspicion of 
footsteps, knowing for certain 
that his hiding was in vain, for 
Dorchin was undoubtedly aware 
of every move he made. But no 
one stopped him, and he found 
another door. 

It was a simple enough door 
from the inside. But when he 
opened it and stepped out, it was 
like nothing he had ever seen. 

First there was light — brilliant, 
incredible, blinding light. Burck- 
hardt blinked upward, unbeliev- 
ing and afraid. 

He was standing on a ledge of 
smooth, finished metal. Not a 
dozen yards from his feet, the 
ledge dropped sharply away; he 



hardly dared approached the 
brink, but even from where he 
stood he could see no bottom to 
the chasm before him. And the 
gulf extended out of sight into 
the glare on eitiier side of him. 

N O wonder Dorchin could so- 
easily give him his freedom! 
From the factory, there was no- 
where to go— but how incredible 
this fantastic gulf, how impossible 
the hundred white and blinding 
suns that hung above! 

A voice by his side said in- 
quiringly, “Burckhardt?” And 
thunder rolled the name, mutter- 
ingly soft, back and forth in the 
abyss before him. 

Burckhardt wet his lips. “Y- 
yes?” he croaked. 

“This is Dorchin. Not a robot 
this time, but Dorchin in the 
flesh, talking to you on a hand 
mike. Now you have seen, Burck- 
hardt. Now will you be reason- 
able and let the maintenance 
crews take over?” 

Burckhardt stood paralyzed. 
One of the moving mountains in 
the blinding glare came toward 
him. 

It towered hundreds of feet 
over his head; he stared up at 
its top, squinting helplessly into 
the light. 

It looked like — 

Impossible I 

The voice in the loudspeaker 
at the door said, “Burckhardt?” 



THE TUNNEL UNDER THE WORLD 



35 




But he was unable to answer. 

A heavy rumbling sigh. “I see,” 
said the voice. “You finally un- 
derstand. There’s no place to go. 
You know it now. I could have 
told you, but you might not have 
believed me, so it was better for 
you to see it yourself. And after 
all, Burckhardt, why would I re- 
construct a city just the way it 
was before? I’m a businessman; I 
count costs. If a thing has to be 
full-scale, I build it that way. 
But there wasn’t any need to in 
this case.” 

From the mountain before him. 
Burckhardt helplessly saw a 
lesser cliff descend carefully to- 
ward him. It was long and dark, 
and at the end of it was white- 
ness, five-fingered whiteness . 

“Poor little Burckhardt,” 
crooned the loudspeaker, while 
the echoes rumbled through the 
enormous chasm that was only a 
workshop. “It must have been 
quite a shock for you to find out 
you were living in a town built 
on a table top.” 

VI 

I T was the morning of June 
15th, and Guy Burckhardt 
woke up screaming out of a 
dream. 



It had been a monstrous and 
incomprehensible dream, of ex- 
plosions and shadowy figures 
that were not men and terror be- 
yond words. 

He shuddered and opened his 
eyes. 

Outside his bedroom window, 
a hugely amplified voice was 
howling. 

Burckhardt stumbled over to the 
window and stared outside. There 
was an out-of -season chill to the 
air, more like October than June; 
but the scene was normal enough 
— except for the sound-truck that 
squatted at curbside halfway 
down the block. Its speaker horns 
blared: 

“Are you a coward? Are you a 
fool? Are you going to let crooked 
politicians steal the country from 
you? NO! Are you going to put 
up with four more years of graft 
and crime? NO! Are you going to 
vote straight Federal Party all up 
and down the ballot? YES! You 
just bet you are!” 

Sometimes he screams, some- 
times he wheedles, threatens, 
begs, cajoles . but his voice 
goes on and on through one 
June 15th after another.

By EVELYN E. SMITH 

Illustrated by KOSSIN 



HE Perzils are giving a 
I vilbar party tomorrow 
B night,” Professor Slood 
said cajolingly. “You will come 
this time, won’t you, Narli?” 
Narli Gzann rubbed his fore- 
head fretfully. “You know how I 
feel about parties, Karn.” He took 
a frismil nut out of the tray on 
his desk and nibbled it in an- 
noyance. 

“But this is in your honor, 
Narli — a farewell party. You 
must go. It would be — it would 
be unthinkable if you didn’t.” 
Karn Slood’s eyes were pleading. 
He could not possibly be held 



responsible for his friend’s anti- 
social behavior and yet, Narli 
knew, he would somehow feel at 
fault. 

Narli sighed. He supposed he 
would have to conform to public 
sentiment in this particular in- 
stance, but he was damned if he 
would give in gracefully. “After 
all, what’s so special about the 
occasion? I’m just leaving to take 
another teaching job, that’s all.” 
He took another nut. 

“That’s alir Slood’s face 
swelled with emotion. “You can’t 
really be that indifferent.” 

“Another job, that’s all it is to 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




me,” Narli persisted. “At an ex- 
ceptionally high salary, of course, 
or I wouldn’t dream of accepting 
a position so inconveniently lo- 
cated.” 

Slood was baffled and hurt and 
outraged. “You have been hon- 
ored by being the first of our 
people to be offered an exchange 
professorship on another planet,” 
he said stiffly, “and you call it 
‘just another job.’ Why, I would 
have given my right antenna to 
get it!” 

Narli realized that he had again 
overstepped the invisible bound- 
ary between candor and tactless- 
ness. He poked at the nuts with 
a stylus. 

“Honored by being the first of 
our species to be offered a guinea- 
pigship,” he murmured. 

He had not considered this 
aspect of the matter before, but 
now that it occurred to him, he 
was probably right. 

“Oh, I don't mind, really.” He 
waved away the other’s sudden 
commiseration. “You know I like 
being alone most of the time, so I 
won’t find that uncomfortable. 
Students are students, whether 
they’re Terrestrials or Saturnians. 
I suppose they’ll laugh at me be- 
hind my back, but then even 
here, my students always did 
that.” 

He gave a hollow laugh and 
unobtrusively put out one of 
his hands for a nut. “At least on 



Earth I’ll know why they're 
laughing.” 

^ ^HERE was pain on Slood’s 
-*• expressive face as he firmly 
removed the nut tray from his 
friend’s reach. “I didn’t think of 
it from that angle, Narli. Of 
course you’re right. Human be- 
ings, from what I’ve read of 
them, are not noted for tolerance. 
It will be difficult, but I’m sure 
you’ll be able to — ” he choked on 
the kindly lie — “win them over.” 

Narli repressed a bitter laugh. 
Anyone less likely than he to win 
over a hostile alien species 
through sheer personal charm 
could hardly be found on Saturn. 
Narli Gzann had been chosen as 
first exchange professor between 
Saturn and Earth because of his 
academic reputation, not his per- 
sonality. But although the choos- 
ers had probably not had that 
aspect of the matter in mind, the 
choice, he thought, was a wise 
one. 

As an individual of solitary 
habits, he was not apt to be much 
lonelier on one planet than an- 
other. 

And he had accepted the post 
largely because he felt that, as 
an alien being, he would be left 
strictly alone. This would give 
him the chance to put in a lot of 
work on his definitive history of 
the Solar System, a monumental 
project from which he begrudged 



THE VILBAR PARTY 



39 




all the time he had to spend in 
fulfilling even the minimum obli- 
gations expected of a professor 
on sociable Saturn. 

The salary was a weighty fac- 
tor, too— not only was it more 
than twice what he had been 
getting, but since there would be 
no necessity for spending more 
than enough for bare subsistence 
he would be able to save up a 
considerable amount and retire 
while still comparatively young. 
It was pleasant to imagine a 
scholarly life unafflicted by stu- 
dents. 

He could put up with a good 
deal for that goal. 

But how could he alleviate the 
distress he saw on Karn’s face? 
He did not consciously want to 
hurt the only person who, for 
some strange reason, seemed to 
be fond of him, so he said the 
only thing he could think of to 
please: “All right, Kam, I’ll go to 
the Perzils tomorrow night.” 

It would be a deadly bore — 
parties always were — and he 
would eat too much, but, after 
all, the thought that it would be 
a long time before he’d ever see 
any of his own kind again would 
make the affair almost endurable. 
And just this once it would be all 
right for him to cat as much as 
he wanted. When he was on 
Earth out of reach of decent 
food, he would probably trim 
down considerably. 



“¥ JUST know you’re going to 
love Earth, Professor Gzann,” 
the hostess on the interplanetary 
liner gushed. 

“I’m sure I shall,” he lied po- 
litely. She smiled at him too 
much, over-doing her professional 
cordiality; underneath the effu- 
siveness, he sensed the repulsion. 
Of course he couldn’t blame her 
for trying not to show her dis- 
taste for the strange creature — 
the effort at concealment was, as 
a matter of fact, more than he 
had expected from a Terrestrial. 
But he wished she would leave 
him alone to meditate. He had 
planned to get a lot of meditation 
done on the journey. 

“You speak awfully good Eng- 
lish,” she told him. 

He looked at her. “I am said to 
have some scholarly aptitude. I 
understand that’s why I was 
chosen as an exchange professor. 
It does seem reasonable, doesn’t 
it?” 

She turned pink — a sign of em- 
barrassment with these creatures, 
he had learned. “I didn’t mean 
to — ^to question your ability. Pro- 
fessor. It’s just that — ^well, you 
don’t look like a professor.” 

“Indeed?” he said frostily. 
“And what do I look like, then?” 

She turned even rosier. “Oh — I 
— I don’t know exactly. It’s just 
that — well . .” And she fled. 

He couldn’t resist flicking his 
antennae forward to catch her

sotto voce conversation with the 
co-pilot ; it was so seldom you got 
the chance to learn what others 
were saying about you behind 
your back. "But I could hardly 
tell him he looks like a teddy 
bear, could I?” 

"He probably doesn’t even 
know what a teddy bear is.” 

"Perhaps I don’t,” Narli 
thought resentfully, "but I can 
guess.” 

With low cunning, the Terres- 
trials seemed to have ferreted out 
the identity of all his favorite 
dishes and kept serving them to 
him incessantly. By the time the 
ship made planetfall on Earth, he 
had gained ten grisbuts. 

"Oh, well,” he thought, “I sup- 
pose it’s all just part of the regu- 
lar diplomatic service. On Earth, 
I’ll have to eat crude native 
foods, so I’ll lose all the weight 
again.” 

President Purrington of North 
America came himself to meet 
Narli at the airfield because 
Narli was the first interplanetary 
exchange professor in history. 

“Welcome to our planet. Pro- 
fessor Gzann,” he said with warm 
diplomatic cordiality, wringing 
Narli’s upper right hand after a 
moment of indecision. "We shall 
do everything in our power to 
make your stay here a happy and 
memorable one.” 

"I wish you would begin by do- 
ing something about the climate,” 



Narli thought. It was stupid of 
him not to have realized how hot 
it would be on Earth. He was 
really goii^ to suffer in this tor- 
rid climate; especially in the tight 
Terrestrial costume he wore over 
his fur for the sake of conformity. 
Of course, justice compelled him 
to admit to himself, the clothes 
wouldn’t have become so snug if 
he hadn’t eaten quite so much on 
board ship. 

Purrington indicated the fe- 
male beside him. "May I intro- 
duce my wife?” 

"Ohhh,” the female gasped, 
"isn’t he cute!” 

T he President and Narli stared 
at her in consternation. She 
looked abashed for a moment, 
then smiled widely at Narli and 
the press photographers. 

"Welcome to Earth, dear Pro- 
fessor Gzann!” she exclaimed, 
mispronouncing his name, of 
course. Bending down, she kissed 
him right upon his fuzzy fore- 
head. 

Kissing was not a Saturnian 
practice, nor did Nami approve 
of it; however, he had read 
enough about Earth to know that 
Europeans sometimes greeted 
dignitaries in this peculiar way. 
Only this place, he had been giv- 
en to understand, was not Europe 
but America. 

"I am having a cocktail party 
in your honor this afternoon!” 



THE VILBAR PARTY

she beamed, smoothing her flow- 
ered print dress down over her 
girdle. “You’ll be there at five 
sharp, won’t you, dear?’’ 

“Delighted,” he promised dis- 
mally. He could hardly plead a 
previous engagement a moment 
after arriving. 

“I’ve tried to get all the things 
you like to eat,” she went on anx- 
iously, “but you will tell me if 
there’s anything special, won’t 
you?” 

“I am on a diet,” he said. He 
must be strong. Probably the 
food would be repulsive anyhow, 
so he’d have no difficulty control- 
ling his appetite. “Digestive dis- 
orders, you know. A glass of 
Vichy and a biscuit will be . .” 
He stopped, for there were 
tears in Mrs. Purrington’s eyes. 
“Your tummy hurts? Oh, you 
poor little darling!” 

“Gladys!” the President said 
sharply. 

There were frismil nuts at Mrs. 
Purrington’s cocktail party and 
vilbar and even slipnis broogs 
... all imported at fabulous ex- 
pense, Narli knew, but then this 
was a government affair and ex- 
pense means nothing to a govern- 
ment since, as far as it is 
concerned, money grows on tax- 
payers. Some of the native foods 
proved surprisingly palatable, 
too— pate de foie gras and cham- 
pagne and little puff pastries full 
of delightful surprises. Narli was 



afraid he was making a zloogle 
of himself. However, he thought, 
trying not to catch sight of his 
own portly person in the mirrors 
that walled the' room, the lean 
days were just ahead. 

Besides, what could he do when 
everyone insisted on pressing 
food on him? “Try this. Professor 
Gzann.” “Do try that, Professor 
Gzann.” (“Doesn’t he look cun- 
ning in his little dress suit?”) 
They crowded around him. The 
women cooed, the men beamed, 
and Narli ate. He would be glad 
when he could detach himself 
from all this cloying diplomacy 
and get back to the healthy ran- 
cor of the classroom. 

A T school, the odor of chalk 
dust, ink and rotting apple 
cores was enough like its Saturn- 
ian equivalent to make Narli 
feel at home immediately. The 
students would dislike him on 
-sight, he knew. It is in the nature 
of the young to be hostile toward 
whatever is strange and alien. 
They would despise him and jeer 
at him, and he, in his turn, would 
give them long, involved home- 
work assignments and such dif- 
ficult examinations that they 
would fail . 

Narli waddled briskly up to 
his desk which had, he saw, been 
scaled down to Saturnian size, 
whereas he had envisioned him- 
self struggling triumphantly with 



THE VILBAR PARTY 



43 




ordinary Earth-sized, furniture. 
But the atmosphere was as hot 
and sticky and intolerable as he 
had expected. Panting as unob- 
trusively as possible, he rapped 
with his pointer. “Attention, stu- 
dents!” 

Now should come the derisive 
babble . but there was a re- 
spectful silence, broken suddenly 
by a shrill feminine whisper of, 
“Oooo, he’s so adorable!” follow- 
ed by the harsh, “Shhh, Aval 
You’ll embarrass the poor little 
thing.” 

Narli’s face swelled. “I am your 
new professor of Saturnian Stud- 
ies. Saturn, as you probably 
know, is a major planet. It is 
much larger and more important 
than Earth, which is only a mi- 
nor planet.” 

The students obediently took 
this down in their notebooks. 
They carefully took down every- 
thing he said. Even a bout of 
coughing that afflicted him half- 
way through seemed to be get- 
ting a phonetic transcription. 
From time to iime, they would 
interrupt his lecture with ques- 
tions so pertinent, so well-thought 
out and so courteous that all he 
could do was answer them. 

His antennae lifted to catch 
the whispers that from time to 
time were exchanged between 
even the best-behaved of the stu- 
dents. “Isn’t he precious?” 
“Seems like a nice fellow — sound 



grasp of his subject.” “Sweet lit- 
tle thing!” “Unusually interest- 
ing presentation." “Doesn’t he re- 
mind you of Winnie the Pooh?” 
“Able chap.” “Just darling!” 

After class, instead of rushing 
out of the room, they hovered 
around his desk with intelligent, 
solicitous questions. Did he like 
Earth? Was his desk too high? 
Too low? Didn’t he find it hot 
with all that fur? Such lovely, 
soft, fluffy fur, though. “Do you' 
mind if I stroke one of your paws 
— hands — Professor?” (“So cud- 
dly-looking!”) 

He said yes, as a matter of 
fact, he was hot, and no, he didn’t 
mind being touched in a spirit of 
scientific investigation. 

He had a moment of uplift at 
the teachers’ cafeteria when he 
discovered lunch to be virtually 
inedible. The manager, however, 
had been distressed to see him 
pick at his food, and by dinner- 
time a distinguished Chef with an 
expert knowledge of Saturnian 
cuisine had been rushed from 
Washington. Since the school 
food was inedible for all intelli- 
gent life-forms, everyone ate the 
Saturnian dishes and praised 
Narli as a public benefactor. 

^^HAT night, alone in the quiet 
confines of his small room at 
the Men’s Faculty Club, Narli 
had spread out his notes and was 
about to start work on his his- 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




tory when there was a knock at 
the door. He trotted over to open 
it, grumbling to himself. 

The head of his department 
smiled brightly down at him. 
“Some of us are going out for a 
couple of drinks and a gabfest. 
Care to come along?” 

Narli did not see how he could 
refuse and still carry the Saturn- 
ian’s burden, so he accepted. Dis- 
covering that gin fizzes and 
Alexanders were even more palat- 
able than champagne and more 
potent than vilbar, he told sev- 
eral Saturnine locker-room stories 
which were hailed with loud 
merriment. But he was being 
laughed at, not with, he knew. 
All this false cordiality, he as- 
sured himself, would die down 
after a couple of days, and then 
he would be able to get back to 
work. He must curb his intellec- 
tual impatience. 

In the morning, he found that 
enrollment in his classes had dou- 
bled, and the room was crowded 
to capacity with the bright, shin- 
ing, eager faces of young Terres- 
trials athirst for learning. There 
were apples, chocolates and im- 
ported frismil nuts on his desk, 
as well as a pressing invitation 
from Mrs. Purrington for him to 
spend all his weekends and holi- 
days at the White House. The 
window was fitted with an air- 
conditioning unit which, he later 
discovered, his classes had chip- 



ped in to buy for him, and the 
temperature had been lowered to 
a point where it was almost com- 
fortable. All the students wore 
coats. 

When he went out on the cam- 
pus, women — students, teachers, 
even strangers — stopped to talk 
to him, to exclaim over him, to 
touch him, even to kiss him. Pho- 
tographers were perpetually tak- 
ing pictures, some of which 
turned up in the Student Union 
as full-color postcards. They sold 
like Lajl out of season. 

Narli wrote in Saturnian on 
the back of one: “Having miser- 
able time ; be glad you’re not 
here,” and sent it to Slood. 

There were cocktail parties, 
musicales and balls in Narli’s 
honor. When he tried to refuse an 
invitation, he was accused of shy- 
ness and virtually dragged to the 
affair by laughing members of 
the faculty. He put on so much 
weight that he had to buy a com- 
plete new Terrestrial outfit, 
which set him back a pretty pen- 
ny. As a result, he had to aug- 
ment his income by lecturing to 
women’s clubs. They slobbered 
appallingly. 

N ARLI’S students did all their 
homework assiduously and, 
in fact, put in more work than 
had been assigned. At the end of 
the year, not only did all of them 
pass, but with flying colors. 



THE VILBAR PARTY

“I hope you’ll remember, Pro- 
fessor Gzann,” the President of 
the University said, “that there 
will always be a job waiting for 
you here — a non-exchange pro- 
fessorship. Love to have you.” 

“Thank you,” Narli replied po- 
litely. 

Mrs. Purrington broke into 
loud sobs when he told her he was 
leaving Earth. “Oh, I’ll miss you 
so, Narli! You will write, won’t 
you?” 

“Yes, of course,” he said grim- 
ly. That made two hundred and 
eighteen people to whom he’d had 
to promise to write. 

It was fortunate he was travel- 
ing as a guest of the North Amer- 
ical government, he thought as 
he supervised the loading of his 
matched interplanetary luggage; 
his eight steamer baskets; his 
leather-bound Encyclopedia Ter- 
restria, with his name imprinted 
in gold on each volume; his In- 
dian war-bonnet; his oil painting 
of the President ; and his six cases 
of champagne — all parting gifts 
— onto the liner. Otherwise the 
fee for excess luggage would take 
what little remained of his bank 
account. There had been so many 
expenses — clothes and hostess 
gifts and ice. 

Not all his mementoes were in 
his luggage. A new rare-metal 
watch gleamed on each of his 
four furry wrists; a brand-new 
trobskin wallet, platinum key- 



chain, and uranium fountain pen 
were in his pocket; and a dia- 
mond and curium bauble clasped 
a tie lovingly handpainted by a 
female student. The argyles on 
his fuzzy ankles had been knitted 
by another. Still another devoted 
pupil had presented him with a 
hand-woven plastic case full of 
frismil nuts to eat on the way 
back. 

W ELL, Narli!” Slood said, 
his face swelling with joy. 
“Well, well! You’ve put on 
weight, I see.” 

Narli dropped into his old chair 
with a sigh. Surely Slood might 
have picked something else to 
comment on first — his haggard- 
ness, for instance, or the increased 
spirituality of his expression. 

“Nothing else to do on Earth 
in your leisure moments but eat, 
I suppose,” Slood said, pushing 
over the nut tray. “Even their 
food. Have some frismils.” 

“No, thank you,” Narli replied 
coldly. 

Slood looked at him in distress. 
“Oh, how you must have suffer- 
ed! Was it very, very bad, Narli?” 
Narli hunched low in his chair. 
“It was just awful.” 

“I’m sure they didn’t mean to 
be unkind,” Slood assured him. 
“Naturally, you were a strange 
creature to them and they’re 
only — ” 

"Unkind?” Narli gave a bitter 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




laugh. “They practically killed 
me with kindness! It was fuss, 
fuss, fuss all the time.” 

“Now, Narli, I do wish you 
wouldn’t be quite so sarcastic.” 
“I’m not being sarcastic. And 
I wasn’t a strange creature to 
them. It seems there’s a sort of 
popular child’s toy on Earth 
known as a — ” he winced — “ted- 
dy bear. I aroused pleasant child- 
hood memories in them, so they 
showered me with affection and 
edibles.” 

Slood closed his eyes in an- 
guish. “You arc very brave, 
Narli,” he said almost reverently. 
“Very brave and wise and good. 
Certainly that would be the best 
thing to tell our people. After all, 
the Terrestrials are our allies; we 
don’t want to stir up public senti- 
ment against them. But you can 
be honest with me, Narli. Did 
they refuse to serve you in restau- 
rants? Were you segregated in 
public vehicles? Did they shrink 
from you when you came close?” 
Narli beat the desk with all 
four hands. “I was hardly ever 
given the chance to be alone! 
They crawled all over me! Res- 
taurants begged for my trade! I 
had to hire private vehicles be- 
cause in public ones I was 
mobbed by admirers!” 

“Such a short time,” Slood 
murmured, “and already suspi- 
cious of even me, your oldest 
friend. But don’t talk about it if 



you don’t want to, Narli . Tell 
me, though, did they sneer at you 
and whisper half-audible insults? 
Did they — ” 

“You’re right!” Narli snapped. 
“I don't want to talk about it.” 
Slood placed a comforting hand 
upon his shoulder. “Perhaps 
that’s wisest, until the shock of 
your experience has worn off.” 
Narli made an irritable noise. 
“The Perzils are giving a vilbar 
party tonight,” Slood said. “But 
I know how you feel about par- 
ties. I’ve told them you’re ex- 
hausted from your trip and won’t 
be able to make it.” 

“Oh, you did, did you?” Narli 
asked ironically. “What makes 
you think you know how I feel 
about parties?” 

“But—” 

“There’s an interesting saying 
on Earth: ‘Travel is so broaden- 
ing.’ ” He looked down at his 
bulges with tolerant amusement. 
“In more than one way, in case 
the meaning eludes .you. Very 
sound psychologically. I’ve dis- 
covered that I like parties. I like 
being liked. If you’ll excuse me. 
I’m going to inform the Perzils 
that I shall be delighted to come 
to their party. Care to join me?” 
“Well,” Slood mumbled, “I’d 
like to, but I have so much 
work — ” 

“Introvert!” said Narli, and he 
began dialing the Perzils.

S ITTING at his desk, Colo- 
nel Halter brought the 
images on the telescreen 
into focus. Four booster tugs were 
fastening, like sky-bamacles, on- 
to the hull of the ancient derelict, 
Alpha. 

He watched as they swung her 
around, stem down, and sank 
with her through the blackness, 
toward the bluish-white, moon- 
lighted arc of Earth a thousand 
miles below. 

He pressed a button. The image 
of tugs and hull faded and the 



control room of the old ship swam 
onto the screen. 

Colonel Halter saw the crew, 
sitting in a half circle, before the 
control panel. 

The telescreen in the control 
room of old Alpha was yet dark. 
The faces watching it held no 
care lines or laugh lines, only a 
vague expression of kindness. 
They could be faces of wax or 
those of people dying pleasantly. 

Colonel Halter shook his head. 
Brilliant — the finest space people 
in the field seventy-five years 



PERFECT CONTROL

back — and now he was to get 
them to come out of that old 
hull. God almighty, how could 
you pull people out of an en- 
vironment they ^were perfectly 
adjusted to? Logic? Force? Rea- 
son? Humoring? How could you 
know? 

Talk to them, he told himself. 
He dreaded it, but the problem 
had to be faced. 

He flipped a switch on his 
desk: saw light jump into their 
screen and his own face take 
shape there; saw their faces on 
his own screen, set now, like the 
faces of stone idols. 

He turned another dial. The 
picture swung around so that he 
was looking into their eyes and 
they into his. 

Halter said, “Captain McClel- 
land?” 

One of the old men nodded. 
“Yes.” 

McClelland was clean-shaven. 
His uniform, treated against de- 
terioration, was. immaculate, but 
his body showed frail and bony 
through it. His face was long and 
hollow-cheeked, the eyes deep- 
set and bright. The head was like 
a skull, the nose an eagle’s beak. 

‘Tm Colonel Halter. I’m a 
psychotherapist.” 

N one of them answered. 

There was only the faint 
thrumming of the rockets lower- 
ing the old ship to Earth. 



“Let me be sure I have your 
identities right,” went on Colonel 
Halter. 

He then looked at the man on 
the captain’s right. “You, I be- 
lieve, are ' Lieutenant James 
Brady.” 

Brady nodded, his pale, eroded 
face expressionless. 

Colonel Halter saw the neat 
black uniform, identical with the 
captain’s; saw the cropped gray 
hair and meticulously trimmed 
goatee. 

“And you,” he said to the 
woman sitting beside the lieu- 
tenant, “are Dr. Anna Mueller.” 

The same nod and thin, ex- 
pressionless face. The same pale- 
ness. Faded hazel eyes; hair 
white and trimmed close to her 
head; body emaciated. 

“Daniel Carlyle, astrogator.” 

The nod. 

Like the doctor’s brother, 
thought Colonel Halter, and yet 
like the lieutenant with his 
cropped hair and with an identi- 
cal goatee. 

“Caroline Gordon, dietician 
and televisor. John Crowley, 
rocketman.” 

Each nodded, expressionless, 
their faces like white, weathered 
statues in a desert. 

Colonel Halter turned to the 
captain. The rocket thrum of 
the tugs had become a roar as the 
gravity pulled against the antique 
hull.

“We understand,” said Colonel 
Halter, “that you demand re- 
pairs for your ship and fuel 
enough to take you back into 
deep space.” 

“That is right.” The voice was 
low, slightly harsh. 

“You’re all close to a himdred 
years old. You’d die out there. 
Here, with medical aid, you’d 
easily live to a hundred and 
twenty-five.” 

Dr. Anna Mueller’s head 
moved slightly. “We’re aware of 
that, Colonel.” 

“It’d be pointless,” said the 
colonel, “and a shameful waste. 
You’re still the only crew that 
ever made it out beyond the 
Solar System. You’ve kept 
records of your personal experi- 
ence, how you survived. They’re 
valuable.” 

Dr. Mueller caught her breath. 
“Our adjustinent to space is our 
private concern. I don’t think 
you could understand.” 

“Maybe not, but we could try. 
To us, of course, complete ad- 
justment is a living death.” 

“To us, it was a matter of stay- 
ing alive.” 

Halter turned aside from dis- 
agreement, searching for com- 
mon ground. “You’d be protected 
here, you know. You deserve 
that.” 

“Who’d protect us from you?” 
asked the captain. “Life in the 
Solar System is destructive.” 



¥>RADY, the lieutenant, leaned 
forward. “You’ve failed— all 
through the whole System.” 

“We haven’t finished living in 
it,” said Halter. ‘Who can pin a 
label on us of success or failure?” 

Miss Gordon, dietician and 
televisor, said quietly, “There 
are some records I’d like to show 
you. We compiled them while 
the Alpha was drifting back into 
the System.” 

Halter watched the frail arm 
reach out and turn a dial. 

A point of light grew on the 
screen in Colonel Halter’s office. 

“Pluto,” said her quiet voice. 

Halter watched the lightspot 
focus on a mountain of ice. Men 
in suits of steel were crawling up 
its frozen side. Other men on the 
mountain’s top were sighting 
guns. The men below were sight- 
ing guns. Yellow fire spurted 
from the top and the sides of the 
mountain, blending into a lake 
of fire. There was a great hissing 
and a rushing torrent of boiling 
water and rolling, twisting steel- 
clad bodies. The mountain of ice 
melted like a lump of lard in a 
hot frying pan. Only the steel 
bodies glinted, motionless, in the 
pale wash of sunlight. 

Halter watched the brightness 
die and another lightspot grow 
one moon. The focus shifted in 
close to a fleet of shining silver 
ships. 

Then another fleet dropped 



PERFECT CONTROL

from close above, hanging still, 
and there were blinding flashes 
engulfing each ship below, one 
after the other, until there were 
only the shining ships above, 
climbing into the dusk glow of 
the Sun. 

.. The glowing circle of bright- 
ringed Saturn was already rush- 
ing toward Colonel Halter from 
far back in the depth of screen. 
The focus shifted onto the 
planet’s glaring surface. Men in 
the uniform of Earth soldiers 
were rushing out of transparent 
shell houses and staring in panic 
as the missiles plummeted 
through the shells and erupted 
clouds of steam which spouted 
up from mile-deep craters and 
there was nothing but the steam 
and the holes and the white cold. 

Jupiter made a hole in the 
blackness, with eleven tiny holes 
scattered all around her, like 
droplets of fire. Ships streaked 
up, one for each droplet, circling 
each, spraying fire, until each 
droplet flared like a tiny sun. 

Yellow Mars, holding closely 
its two speedy rocks of moons, 
spun into the screen. 

A straggling line of men moved 
across a desert that whipped 
them with sheets of yellow dust. 
A single ship dived from out of 
the Sun, swooped along the line, 
licking it with the tongue of 
flame that streaked behind. As 
the ship flashed beyond the hori- 



zon, a line of smoking rag 
bundles lay still upon the yellow 
sand. 

TAARKNESS closed in upon 
the television screen in Colo- 
nel Halter’s office. In the long 
moment of silence that followed, 
he thought. Oh, God, aiter this 
awful picture, how can I con- 
vince them to come out of the 
womb of that ship and live a^ain? 
What reason can I give? 

Immobilizing his face, he saw 
the half circle of the six old p>eo- 
ple again in the control room of 
the old, old ship. 

He said, “You’ll set down in 
approximately twenty minutes.” 
“Yes,” agreed the captain, 
“from where we jumped into 
space seventy-five years ago. The 
people of Earth were talking 
about their problems, not killing 
each other about them. There 
was hope. We felt that by the 
time we’d finished our mission 
and come back from that other 
solar system, where a healthy 
colony could be born, most of 
those problems would be solved.” 
A pause. “But now there’s this 
terrible killing all through the 
System. We won’t face it.” 

The roaring of the rockets now 
as they plunged flame against 
the concrete slab of the landing 
field. The bug bodies of the tugs 
gently easing old Alpha to Earth. 
Colonel Halter was saying. 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“How about this other solar sys- 
tem? You haven’t let us know 
whether or not you reached it.” 

“We saw it.” There was a 
hollowness in the captain’s voice. 
“We didn’t reach it. But we will. 
You’ll repair the Alpha and re- 
fuel it.” 

“As you were saying,” prompt- 
ed Colonel Halter, "you didn’t 
reach it.” 

“A meteor,” said the captain. 
“Straight into our rockets. Our 
ship began to drift. The cameras, 
of course, set in the bulkheads, 
were watching us.” 

“May I see? Anything you 
have to show or say will be strict- 
ly between us. I’ve given orders 
for our communication to be un*- 
recorded and private. You have 
my word.” 

“You’ll be allowed to see. I’ve 
given my permission.” 

Colonel Halter thought, You 
have divert permission? 

Then he saw in his telescreen 
the little old lady who was Caro- 
line Gordon, dietician and tele- 
visor, press a button on the side 
of her chair. Instantly the pic- 
ture changed. He heard her 
voice. “You see the rocket room 
of the Alpha back almost seventy- 
five years, a few minutes before 
the accident.” 

T here were the four torpedo- 
like tubes projecting into the 
cylindrical room; the mass of 



levers, buttons, wheels and flash- 
ing lightspots. 

Halter watched John Crowley, 
the rocketman, broad-shouldered 
and lithe, turning a wheel at the 
point of one of the giant tubes. 

The next moment, he was flung 
to the floor. He struggled to his 
feet, jerked an oxygen mask from 
the bag at his chest, clamped it 
to his face and rushed to the 
tubes. He twirled wheels, pulled 
levers, pressed buttons. He 
glanced at the board on which 
the lightspots had been flashing. 
Darkness. He pressed a button. A 
foot-thick metal door swung 
open. He stepped through it. The 
door shut and locked. 

Leaning against the steel wall 
at the end of a long companion- 
way, he pulled off his oxygen 
mask and ran along the com- 
panionway toward the control 
room. 

The others met him in the 
center of the ship. 

Crowley saluted the young 
Captain McClelland. 

“The rockets are gone, sir. A 
meteor.” 

McClelland did not smile or 
frown, show sadness or fear or 
any other emotion. He was tall 
and slim then, with cropped 
black hair, its line high on his 
head. His face was lean and 
strong-featured. There was a 
sense of command about the 
captain. 



PERFECT CONTROL 



53 




Quietly, he said, “Well all go 
to the control room.” 

They followed him as he 
strode along the companionway. 

The telescreen in Colonel Hal- 
ter’s office darkened and there 
was only the old voice of the 
captain, saying, “We were drift- 
ing in space. You know what that 
means. But no one broke down. 
We were too well trained, too 
well conditioned. We gathered in 
the control room.” 

Light opened up again on 
Colonel Halter’s telescreen. He 
saw the polished metal walls, the 
pilot chairs and takeoff ham- 
mocks, the levers, buttons and 
switches of the young ship back 
those many years, and the six 
young people standing before a 
young Captain McClelland, who 
was speaking to them of food, 
water and oxygen. 

It was decided that their meta- 
bolisms must be lowered and 
that they must live for the most 
part in their bunks. All activity 
must be cut to minimum. All 
weapons must be jettisoned, ex- 
cept one, the captain’s shock gun, 
that could not kill but only 
cause unconsciousness for twenty- 
four hours. 

C APTAIN McClelland gave an 
order. The weapons were 
gathered up and placed in an 
airlock which thrust them out 
into space. Five of the crew lay 



down in their bunks. Dr. Anna 
Mueller, tall and slim, full- 
bosomed, tawny-skinned and 
tawny-haired, remained stand- 
ing. She pressed the thought re- 
corders over the heads of the 
other five people who lay there 
motionless, clamped the tiny 
electrodes onto her own temples 
and placed a small, black box, 
covered with many tiny dials, be- 
side the bunk of Miss Gordon, 
the televisor. 

A moment later, a jumble of 
thoughts: Now I am dead. An 
end. For what, now that it’s here? 
Love. The warm press of a body. 
Trees and grass. Sunrise. To take 
poison. Clean air after a rain. 
City, people, lights. Sunset — 

The thought words jumbled 
like a voice from a recorder when 
the speed is turned up. 

Then they faded and one 
thought stream came through 
clean and clear: I am Dr. Anna 
Mueller. Good none of the others 
can hear what I’m thinking. Was 
afraid I’d die this way someday. 
But to prolong it. Painless death 
in an instant. Could give it to us 
all. But orders. Captain McClel- 
land. No feeling? Can’t he see 
what I feel for him? Why am I 
thinking like this? Now. But this 
is what is happening to me. He'd 
rather make love to this ship. 
Kiss Crowley before I give him 
the metabolism sedation shot. 
Captain’ll see I’m a woman. 



54

She stepped to the bulkhead 
and pressed a button. A medicine 
cabinet opened. After filling a 
hypodermic syringe, she went to 
Crowley, bent down and gave 
him a long kiss on the lips. 

Instantly Colonel Halter heard 
thoughts. 

Captain McClelland: She must 
be weak. Why’s she doin^ that? 
Thought she was stronger. But 
the ship’s the thing. The ship 
and I. 

Crowley; What the hell? 
Didn’t know she went for me. 
Just a half hour with her before 
the needle. What’s to lose? He 
pulled her down to him. 

Lieutenant Brady; He’d do 
that, the damned animal. But 
I’m not enough of an animal. I’m 
a good spaceman. All spontane- 
ity’s been trained out of me. Feel 
like killing him. And taking her. 
Anyplace. But I'm so controlled. 
Got to do something. This last 
time . He sat up in his bunk. 

Caroline Gordon; I knew he 
was like that. Married when we 
got back. Mrs. Crowley. And if 
we’d gotten back. Out every 
other night with another woman. 
I could kill him. She turned her 
face away. 

Daniel Carlyle: Look at them. 
And I can’t live. Only one per- 
son needs me, back on Earth, 
and she’s the only. And that’s 
enough. But maybe I can kilt 
myself . He did not move. 



T he thoughts stopped and 
Colonel Halter leaned for- 
ward in his chair as he saw Cap- 
tain McClelland standing beside 
his bunk, the gun in his hand. 
Dr. Mueller saw, too— the young 
Dr Mueller, back those, seventy- 
five years. She struggled to pull 
away from Crowley. 

Lieutenant Brady stood, start- 
ed toward the captain, stopped. 
Crowley pushed Dr. Mueller 
away from him, leaped to his 
feet and lunged toward the cap- 
tain. A stream of light .appeareef 
between the gun muzzle and 
Crowley. He stumbled, caught 
himself, stood up very straight, 
then sank down, as though he 
had been deflated. 

The captain motioned Dr. 
Mueller to her bunk. She hesi- 
tated, pain in her face, turned, 
went to her bunk and lay down. 
Another stream of light appeared 
between her and the gun. She lay 
very still. The needle slipped 
from her fingers. 

The captain turned the gun on 
Lieutenant Brady, who was com- 
ing at him, arms raised. The light 
beam again. The lieutenant sank 
back. Caroline Gordon was 
watching the captain as the light 
stream appeared. She relaxed, 
her eyes closed. Daniel Carlyle 
did not move as the light touched 
him. 

Captain McClelland bolstered 
the gun. He picked up the hypo- 



56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




dermic needle and sterilized it 
at the medicine cabinet. Then he 
injected Crowley’s arm, filled the 
hypo four more times, injected 
the others. 

He finally thrust the needle 
into his own arm and lay down. 
His breathing began to slow. 
There was only the control room 
of the ship now, like some an- 
cient mausoleum, with the six 
still figures and the control board 
dark and the eternal ocean of 
night pressing against the ports. 

The picture of the ship’s con- 
trol room began to fade on the 
screen. After a moment of dark- 
ness, the live picture of the six 
old figures, sitting in their half 
circle, spread again over the 
lighted square. 

Colonel Halter saw his own 
image, looking into the old 
masks: 

He said, “And where was your 
weakness. Captain McClelland?” 

“I was concerned,” said the old 
voice, “with keeping us alive.” 

“You weren’t aware that some 
of your crew were emotionally 
involved with each other?” 

“No.” 

“Are there any more records 
you could show me?” 

“Many more, Colonel, but I 
don’t think it’s necessary for you 
to see them. It would take too 
long. And we want to get back 
out into space.” He paused. “We 
can brief you.” 



“About your going back into 
space . I’m not sure we can 
allow it.” 

“Our answer’s very simple. 
There’s a button, under my 
thumb, on the arm of this chair. 
A little pressure. Carbon mon- 
oxide. It would be quick.” 

“Your idea?” 

“Yes. A matter of preserving 
our integrity. We’d rather die 
than face the horrors of life on 
Earth.” 

H alter turned to the semi- 
circle of faces. “And you’ve 
all agreed to this — this suicide?” 
The captain cut in. “Of course. 
I realized years ago that the only 
place we could live was in space, 
in this ship.” 

“When did your crew realize 
this?” 

“After a couple of years. I told 
them over and over again, day 
after day. After all, I am captain. 
I dictate the policy.” 

“You’ve come back. You’re in 
port. You’re not in complete 
command.” 

“I’ll always be in command.” 
“Perhaps,” said Halter quietly. 
“However, we can come back to 
that. Please brief me on the 
records.” 

Captain McClelland’s face 
hardened as he turned to Dr. 
Anna Mueller. 

She explained, “We regained 
consciousness twenty-four hours 



PERFECT CONTROL

after Captain McClelland used 
the shock gun on us. By then, 
our metabolisms were high 
enough to keep us conscious and 
alive. We could lift nutrition and 
water capsules to our mouths. 
We could press the button to 
activate the exercise mechanisms 
in our bunks. The output of the 
air machines was cut down un- 
til there was just enough to keep 
us alive and thinking clearly. 

“At intervals ©f several days, 
during our exercise and study 
periods, Captain McClelland 
turned up the air. We slept. And 
we dreamed. The dreams are re- 
corded in full. When we could 
face them, they were played back 
to us. Our thoughts were played 
back, too. I conducted group 
therapy among us. We all grew 
to understand each other and 
ourselves, intimately, and now, 
in relation to our environment, 
we’re perfectly adjusted.” 

“Did Captain McClelland join 
you in group therapy?” 

“No.” 

“Why?" 

“He was already perfectly ad- 
justed.” 

S HE frowned faintly, glanced at 
the captain. “When we were 
conscious, we studied from the 
library of microfilm. We read all 
the great literature of Earth. We 
watched the great plays and pic- 
tures and the paintings and lis- 



tened to the music. Sometimes 
our thoughts were hateful. There 
was self-pity and hysteria. There 
were times when one or two of us 
would withdraw almost to the 
point of death. Then Captain 
McClelland would knock us out 
with the shock gun. 

“Slowly, over the years, our 
minds gradually merged into one 
mind. We thought and created 
and lived as if we were one per- 
son. There grew to be complete 
and perfect cooperation. And 
from this cooperation came some 
great works. Each one of us will 
tell you. I’ll speak first.” 

She paused. “Psychology has 
always been my prime interest. 
My rating at school was genius. 
My aptitudes were precisely in 
line with the field of work I chose. 
Through the years. I’ve devel- 
oped a theory, discovered a way 
to bring about cooperation be- 
tween all men. This is possible 
in spite of your wars and hatreds 
and destruction.” Frown creases 
wrinkled her parchment fore- 
head. “I’d like to know if it 
would work.” 

Daniel Carlyle’s voice was 
slightly above a whisper. “All my 
life. I’d wanted to write poetry. 
The meteor struck. I realized I 
wouldn’t be allowed to die quick- 
ly. I began to do what I’d always 
wanted to do. The words poured 
into the thought recorder. Every- 
thing I felt and thought is there

and all I’ve been able to know 
and be from this one mind of 
ours that’s in us all. And it’s 
some of the finest poetry that’s 
ever been written.” He closed his 
eyes and sighed heavily. ‘‘It’d be 
good to know if anyone found 
them inspiring.” 

‘‘I’ve always lived for adven- 
ture,” said Crowley, the rocket- 
man, his old voice steady and 
quiet. ‘Tve been the one to quiet 
down last into the life it was 
necessary for us to live but there. 
But my thoughts ran on into 
distant universes and across end- 
less stretches of space. And so at 
last, to keep my sanity, I wrote 
stories of all the adventures I 
should have had, and more. And 
in them is all the native power of 
me, of all adventurers, and the 
eternal sweep of the Universe 
where Man will always thrust out 
to new places.” There was a faint 
trembling in his body and a 
pained light in his eyes. ‘‘Seems 
I ought to know if they’ll ever 
be read.” 

TN spite of Brady’s frailness, 
the lieutenant was like a griz- 
zled old animal growling with his 
last breath. ‘‘I was the most 
capable pilot that ever blasted off 
from Earth. But I was also an 
inventor and designer. A lot of 
the ships Earth pilots are flying 
today are basically my ideas. 
After the accident, I wanted to 



get drunk and make love and then 
let myself out into space, with a 
suit, and be there forever. But 
Captain McClelland’s shock gun 
and the understanding seeping 
into me from the thought record- 
ers calmed me down eventually. 

‘‘So I turned to creation as I 
lay there in my bunk. I designed 
many spaceships. And from those, 
I designed fewer and fewer, in- 
corporating the best from each. 
And now I have on microfilm a 
ship that can thrust out to the 
ends of our galaxy. There aren’t 
any flaws . Oh, I tell you, by 
God, I’d like to see her come to 
life!” 

He leaned back, sweat rolling 
down his bony cheeks. 

Miss Gordon, dietician and 
televisor, the motionless old lady 
with cropped, white hair, and face 
bones across which the paper skin 
was stretched, said, ‘‘There was 
only one thing I wanted when I 
knew I couldn’t have marriage 
and a family. There was a per- 
fect food for the human animal. 
I could find it. I began working 
on formulas. Over and over again, 
I put the food elements together 
and took them apart and put 
them together again. I threw 
away the work of years and 
started over again until at last 
I had my perfect formula.” 

She clasped her hands. ‘‘Man’s

Earth, from the cosmic rays and 
the lights of the suns and from 
the particles of the microcosm, 
Man can take into his body all 
the nutrition that can enable him 
to live forever.” She sat very still, 
smiling. “And it’s got to be given 
a try.” 

Silence. 

Colonel Halter watched the 
old figures sitting like figures in 
a wax museum, waiting, waiting. 
He turned a dial. The picture 
that flashed onto the screen in 
his office showed the pocked ship 
standing upright now, like some 
tree that had grown in the mid- 
dle of a desert where it was never 
meant to grow. 

The space tugs had streaked 
out beyond the atmosphere to 
finish other assignments. There 
were no crowds, no official cars, 
no platforms, no bands. Only 
darkness and silence. 

Halter turned a dial. The con- 
trol room of the old ship flashed 
back onto the screen. The ancient 
crew sat as before. Halter saw his 
own face on their television 
screen. 

Something was missing, he 
thought. What? What hadn’t 
been said? 

And then suddenly it came to 
him. 

The captain. He hadn’t spoken 
of any contribution he had 
made during those interminable 
years. 



XTALTER thought back over 
Captain McClelland’s rec- 
ord. No family. Wiped out when 
he was a baby in the last war. 
Educated and raised by the 
government. Never married. No 
entanglements with women. No 
close friends. Ship’s captain at 
twenty-one. No failures. No va- 
cations. No record of breakdown. 
Perfect physical condition. Strict 
disciplinarian. More time in 
space than on Earth by seventy- 
five per cent. No hobbies. No in- 
terest in the arts . Apparently 
no flhw as a spaceman . The 
end product of the stiffest train- 
ing regimen yet devised by Man. 

The ideal captain. 

The records of the other five? 
All showing slight emotional in- 
stabilities when checked against 
the optimum score of a space- 
man. 

Dr. Mueller — a divorcee. A 
woman men had sought after. 
Dedicated in spare time to so- 
cial psychology. Conflict in her 
decision as to whether she should 
go into the private practice of 
psychotherapy or specialize in 
space psychology. Interested in 
the study of neurosis caused by 
culture. 

Lieutenant Brady — family 
man. Forced himself into mold of 
good husband and father. Bril- 
liant designer. Ambition also to 
be space captain. Conflict be- 
tween these three. Several years

of psychotherapy which released 
his drive for adventure in space. 
Alpha mission to be his last. 
Lack of full leadership qualities 
prevented him from reaching cap- 
taincy. 

Rocketman Crowley — typical 
man of action. Superb physique. 
Decathlon champion. Continual 
entanglements with women. 
Quick temper. Tendency to fight 
if pushed or crossed. Proud. How- 
ever, if under good command, 
best rocketman in the service. 

Astrogator Daniel Carlyle — 
highly sensitive. Psychosomatic 
symptoms unless out in space. 
Then in perfect health. Fine 
mathematician. Highly intuitive, 
yet logical. Saved four missions 
from disaster. Holder of Con- 
gressional Medal of Honor. 
Hobby, poetry. Fiancee was boy- 
hood sweetheart. 

Dietician and televisor Caro- 
line Gordon — youngest of crew. 
Twenty years. Too many apti- 
tudes. Tendency toward imma- 
turity. Many hobbies. Idealistic. 
Emotions unfocused. IQ 165. 
Success in any field of endeavor 
concentrated upon. At eighteen, 
specialized in dietetics and elec- 
tronics. Highest ratings in field. 
Stable when under strict external 
discipline. 

N O, thought Halter. None of 
them fitted space like the 
completely self-sufficient Mc- 



Clelland, the man who could 
stand alone against that black, 
teeming, swirling endlessness of 
space. 

He turned to the captain. The 
old face was placid, the eyes 
slightly out of focus. 

“Captain McClelland,” Halter 
said sharply. 

The pale eyes blinked and 
looked keenly on Halter’s face. 

“You want fuel to take you 
back out into space.” 

“That’s right.” 

“And if you don’t get it, you’ll 
press a button on the arm of 
your chair and you’ll all die of 
carbon monoxide poisoning.” 

“Exactly.” 

“I’m curious about one point.” 
Halter paused. “What did you 
do, Captain, while the others were 
working on their various pro- 
jects?” 

Captain McClelland scowled 
at Halter for a long moment. 
“Why do you want to know 
that?” 

“Your crew members became 
lost in some work they loved. 
They told me about it with a 
certain amount of enthusiasm. 
You haven’t told me what you 
did. I’d like to know — for the 
records.” 

“I watched them. Colonel. I 
watched them and dreamed of 
the time when I could take them 
and the ship back out into space 
under her own power. I love

space and I love this ship. I love 
knowing she’s under power and 
shooting out to the stars. There’s 
nothing more for me.” 

“What else did you do be- 
sides watch them?” 

“I activated the machinery 
that moved my bunk close to 
the controls. I practiced taking 
the ship through maneuvers. I 
kept the controls in perfect work- 
ing order so I’d be ready to take 
off again someday.” 

“If we repaired the ship so 
you could take off, the first 
shock of rocket thrust would kill 
you all.” 

“We’re willing to take that 
chance.” 

Colonel Halter looked around 
the half circle of old faces. “And 
all your long years of work would 
be for nothing. Each of you, ex- 
cept Captain McClelland, has 
made a contribution to Earth 
and Man. You’re needed here, 
not in the emptiness of space.” 
He saw the eyes of the five 
watching him intently; saw a tiny 
flicker of surprise and interest 
on their faces. 

“You’re destroying Earth,” 
said the captain, his voice rising, 
“with your wars and your quar- 
rels. We’ve all of us found peace. 
We’re going to keep it.” 

TTALTER ignored the captain 
and looked at the five. 
“There are many of us on 



Earth, who are fighting a war 
without blood, to save mankind. 
We’ve made progress. We’ve 
worked out agreements among 
the warring nations to do their 
fighting on the barren planets 
where there aren’t any native in- 
habitants, so noncombatants on 
Earth won’t be killed and so the 
Earth won’t be laid waste. That 
was the fighting you saw while 
you were coming in. 

“This is just one example. And 
there’re a lot of us contributing 
ideas and effort. If all of us 
who’re working for Earth were 
to leave it and go out into space, 
the ones who have to fight wars 
would make the Earth as barren 
as the Moon. This is our place 
in the Universe and it’s got to be 
saved.” 

“We’ve adjusted to the control 
room of this ship and to each 
other,” said McClelland flatly. 
“Our work’s done.” 

“Let’s put it like this. Captain. 
Maybe your work’s done. May- 
be you're not interested in what 
happens to Earth.” Halter turned 
to the others. “But what you've 
done adds up to a search for 
answers here on Earth. Poetry. 
Design of a flawless spaceship. A 
psychological theory. A perfect 
diet. Novels about Man pushing 
out and out into space. All this 
indicates a deep concern for the 
health of humanity and its suc- 
cess.” 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“We’re not concerned,” re- 
torted the captain, “with the 
health or success of humanity.” 

Halter sharply examined the 
other faces. He saw a flicker of 
sadness in one, anger in another, 
uncertainty, fear, joy. 

He said, “For seventy-five 
years, you obey your captain. 
You listen to what he says. And 
everything is a command. Yet in 
yourselves you feel a drive to 
carry out your ideas, your cre- 
ations, to their logical ends. 
Which means, will they work 
when they’re applied to Man? 
Will people read the novels? Will 
they catch the meaning of the 
poetry? Will the spaceships 
really work as they’re supposed 
to? Will the psychological theory 
really promote cooperation? Is 
there supreme health in this mar- 
velous diet?” 

He gave them a moment to 
think and then continued. “But 
if you continue to follow the 
commands of the captain, you’ll 
be dead before you’re out of the 
Earth’s atmosphere. You’ll never 
know. Maybe Man will prove 
that your great works are only 
dreams . But I think there’s 
a great need in you to know, one 
way or the other.” 

rwiHERE was a faint stirring 
among them, like that of an- 
cient machines being activated 
after years of lying dormant. 



They glanced at each other. They 
fidgeted. Trouble twisted their 
faces. 

“Colonel Halter,” said the cap- 
tain, “I’m warning you. My 
thumb is on the button. I’ll re- 
lease the gas. Do we get the re- 
pairs and the fuel to take off 
from Earth, or don’t we?” 

Colonel Halter leaned grimly 
toward the captain. “You’ve 
spent fifty years with one idea — 
to stay out in space forever. 
You’ve made no effort to create 
or do one single constructive act. 
I’ll tell you whether or not you 
get the fuel and the repairs — 
after I hear what someone in 
your crew has to say.” 

Silence hung tensely between 
the control room of the ship and 
Colonel Halter’s office on Earth. 
The captain was glaring now at 
Halter. A tear showed in the 
corner of each of Dr. Anna Muel- 
ler’s old eyes. Lieutenant Brady 
was gripping the arms of . his 
chair. Daniel Carlyle’s eyes were 
closed and his head shook slight- 
ly, as though from palsy. There 
was a faint, enigmatic smile on 
Caroline Gordon’s face. The 
cords on Crowley’s neck stood 
out through the tan and wrinkled 
wrapping-paper skin. 

By God, thought Halter, 
they're all sane except the cap- 
tain. And they've ^t to do it. 
They've ^t to come out on their 
own steam or die in that control

“I’m waiting,” he said. “Is 
your work going to die and you 
with it?” 

“We’ll leave all the records,” 
said the captain, his thumb 
poised over the button on the 



his hand. “Damn it, say some- 
thing, one of you!” 

Still the silence and the flick- 
ering looks all around. 

Halter heard a sob. He saw 
Dr. Anna Mueller’s head drop 
forward and her shoulders trem- 




arm of his chair. “That’s 
enough.” 

Halter ignored him. “Each of 
you can help. You’ve only done 
part of the work.” He stood and 
struck the desk with the flat of 



ble. The others were staring at 
her, as if she had suddenly mate- 
rialized among them, like a ghost. 

Then her voice, through the 
trembling and the faint crying: 
“I’ve — I’ve got to know.”

The captain got creakily to his 
feet. “Dr. Mueller! Do you want 
me to use the gun again?” 

She raised her face to his. 
There was pain in it. “I’ve — got 
work to do. There’s so — little

“That’s right. On this ship.

“Wait,” said Halter. “You’re

Captain McClelland hesitated.

Halter, “that Dr. Mueller is 
alone among you. She wants to 
come out and go on with her 
work. The rest of you want the

she’ll have to be sacrificed. After

tcntly at Brady, Crowley, Car- 
lyle, Gordon, where they sat in 
the half circle, staring back at 
him. “So — ” 

Lieutenant Brady struggled up 
from his chair. 

“I’ve got twenty-five years of 
life. I’ve some ships to design.” 

“That goes for me, too,” said 
Crowley, the rocketman. “Will 
anybody want to read my 
novels?” 

Astrogator Carlyle leaned for- 
ward. “There are many more 
poems to be written.” 

“Give me a soundproof labora- 
tory,” said Caroline Gordon. “I’ll 
add another fifty years to all 
your lives.” 

“I’m afraid it is mutiny. Cap- 
tain,” said Halter. 

The captain started toward his 
chair, his hand reaching for the 
button on its arm. 

Lieutenant Brady stumbled 
forward, blocking his way. 

Halter could only watch, 
thinking, Ifs up to them. They've 
to do it now! 

He saw the captain draw his 
shock gun; saw light fiare at its 
muzzle; saw Lieutenant Brady 
crumple like a collapsing skele- 
ton. 

Crowley reached forward, 
grasping McClelland’s shoulder. 
The gun swung toward him. A 
stream of light squirted into his 
middle. Crowley fell forward, 
pulling the captain down with 



him. The three other oldsters 
were above the three black fig- 
ures sprawled on the floor, like 
tangled puppets. They hesitated 
a moment, then fell upon the 
ones below them, black arms and 
legs twitching about now like 
the legs of dying spiders, strug- 
gling weakly. 

A flash of light exploded be- 
neath these twisting black reeds 
and streaks of it shot out all 
through the waving black cluster. 

The next moment, they settled 
and were quiet. 

^’^HERE was a stillness in the 
ancient control room, like the 
stillness in a sunken ship at the 
bottom of the sea. It lingered 
for a long time, while Colonel 
Halter watched and waited. 

Dr. Mueller’s voice, seventy- 
five years tired, said, “He’s — 
quiet now. Please come and take 
us out.” 

Colonel Halter switched on his 
desk visiophone. 

“They’re coming out,” he said 
quietly. “I’ll be there to super- 
vise.” 

On the visiophone, the gener- 
al’s image nodded. “Congratula- 
tions, Colonel. How are they?” 

“There’ll be one case for psy- 
cho. Captain McClelland.” 

“I’ll be damned!” exclaimed 
the general. “From his record, I 
thought he’d never break!” 

“Let’s say he couldn’t bend.

sir.” A pause. “And yet he did 
keep them from destroying them- 
selves.” 

“He’ll be made well again . 
What about the others?” 

“I think they, too, are very 
great and human people.” 
“Well.” said the general, 
“they’re your patients. I’ll see 
you at the ship in five minutes.” 
“I’ll be there, sir.” Colonel 
Halter flipped the switch. The 
visiophone blanked out. He 
looked at the television screen. 

The six black-clothed figures 
were quiet on the floor of their 
ship’s control room. They re- 
minded him of sleeping children 
curled together for warmth. 



As he left his office and walked 
out into the humming city, he 
felt drained, still shaking with 
tension, realizing even now how 
close he had come to failure. 

But there was the scarred and 
pitted needle-nosed old hull, 
bright with moonlight, standing 
like a monument against the 
night sky. 

Not a monument to the past, 
though. 

It marked the birthplace of 
the future . and he had been 
midwife. He felt his shoulders 
straighten at the knowledge as 
he walked toward the ancient 
ship.

CALENDAR TROUBLE 

R eading idly through an 
old book, Camille Flam- 
marion’s Dreams oi an 
Astronomer, I happened across 
the sentence; “As with us, there 
is no integral number of days in 
the Martian year. Perhaps their 
calendar has also been reformed 
several times without being made 
perfect. But let us hope that 
they are not as stupid as we are, 
with our months of 28, 29, 30 and 
31 days and with our three days

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of days — ^the commercial day 
which begins at midnight, the 
astronomical day which begins 
the following noon and the naval 
day which commenced the pre- 
vious noon.” This, combined with 
a letter asking about, the mean- 
ing of the names of the weekdays, 
reminded me that, one year ago, 
I had the best of intentions of de- 
voting the first column of the 
new year to the appropriate dis- 
cussion of New Year. 

I don’t remember just what got 
in my way a year ago, but no 
matter — one January issue is as 
good as another January issue to 
think about the thing we live by: 
the calendar. I feel quite certain 
that I am not the only one who 
is thinking about the problem at 
this time of the year. Comes New 
Year’s Day, you’ll probably read 
in your daily paper that State 
Senator Soandso is all in favor of 
a calendar revision, and if you 
watch the letter column, you’ll 
find a reply in which the Senator 
is denounced as a heathen-in- 
disguise, a man of ill will or at 
least a moron. This might well be 
followed by another letter de- 
claring that the original letter 
writer described himself perfectly. 

jT|ISREGARDING such pleas- 
antries, there remains the 
very simple fact that the calendar 
is not perfect — something I en- 
counter myself roughly once a 



day. Somebody wants to know 
whether I’d be available for a 
lecture on, say, January 25 or 
whether I’d prefer January 28. 
First thing I have to do is see if 
one of these days is a Monday; 
for family reasons, Mondays are 
inconvenient to me. Or a trans- 
portation schedule may hinge on 
the problem of whether there will 
be four or five Sundays in Oc- 
tober. (Don’t look it up; try to 
guess.) I am also slightly tired 
of the routine — so frequently 
needed in historical research — of 
figuring out whether May 1st, 
1898, was a Sunday. (It was.) 

When I was a small boy, I 
learned that I had been born on a 
Tuesday and, remembering that 
my most recent birthday had not 
been on a Tuesday, I wanted to 
know what had happened to my 
birthday. I am not certain 
whether I got an explanation I 
did not understand or whether 
(as is more likely) I was simply 
told that I wasn’t old enough 
to understand; at any event, I 
wished then that a birthday would 
come on the same day. I still 
think it should. Now I know, of 
course, why this isn’t the case. 
But I also know that it could be. 

However, let’s begin at the be- 
ginning. The roots of the trouble 
are two simple astronomical facts. 
One is that the Earth needs 365 
days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 
seconds to go around the Sun

once. If it needed 360 days or 
372 days, things would be better 
— though not yet “fine” — and in 
the face of natural law, one would 
even be willing to settle for 365^ 
days. That is one of the difficul- 
ties; the year does not consist of 
a number of whole days. The 
other is that we have a moon. 

I admit at the outset that it 
is a very pretty moon. It is one 
of the biggest in the Solar Sys- 
tem and its existence helped to 
get several sciences and assorted 
interesting and exasperating su- 
perstitions going. It is a challenge 
to space travel and all that. 

The trouble is that primitive 
peoples, at a time when artificial 
clocks were still to be invented, 
used it as a clock. The waxing 
and waning of the Moon was 
easily visible and time reckoning 
based itself almost automatically 
on the lunar phases. 

But the natural rhythm of life 
is the daily change from light to 
darkness and back to light again, 
based on the apparent movement 
of the Sun. The Moon, large and 
luminous and conspicuous as it 
was, could not do away with the 
day. Time reckoning, as a con- 
sequence, became a mixture of 
solar and lunar phenomena; time 
expressions were of solar or lunar 
origin, depending on the time in- 
terval to be expressed. 

A messenger was to return 
either when the shadows length- 



ened, or else after the Sun had 
taken two baths in the ocean. 
That was solar. But if it was a 
long trip, the messenger might 
not be back until after the Moon 
had twice renewed itself. That, 
of course, was lunar. If the trip 
was really long, it might happen 
that the voyagers would not re- 
turn until two winters had gone 
by — solar reckoning again. 

A S long as you could be lavish 
with a few days, all this did 
not matter. The difficulties began 
when people tried to pin time 
down a little more accurately, 
such as for the purpose of a fes- 
tival. Just how many days are 
there between two “moons”? An- 
swer (modem) : 29.5305879. And 
how many “moons” between two 
winters? A disturbing 12.3682668. 

Now you either know these 
unpleasant figures or you don’t 
and believe that you are dealing 
with 29^ days and 12^ “moons.” 
If you believe the latter, your 
calendar will get out of order 
rapidly. If you do know the fig- 
ures, you realize that these things 
do not mesh and you struggle 
for a compromise which somehow 
fits the days, the seasons and the 
phases of the Moon together. 

None of the many attempts 
made at various times by various 
people was ever completely suc- 
cessful; none can be successful 
since the actual units are not 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




commensurable. However, the job 
can be simplified and the result 
improved if you throw out one 
of the incommensurable units, 
namely, the phases of the Moon. 

This, in fact, was done in the 
oldest calendar we know of, the 
Egyptian calendar. Life in Egypt 
was based on the flooding of the 
Nile, an annual event, and their 
calendar had three seasons, named 
Flood Time, Seed Time and Har- 
vest Time. 

Each season was subdivided 
into four months, so that a full 
year contained twelve months. 
They used the same figure, 
twelve, to subdivide night and day 
into smaller units, the hours. But 
the early Egyptian hours were 
based on the actual times of day- 
light and night, so that the length 
of an hour changed with the sea- 
sons, which accounts for their 
Latin name of horae temporales, 
the “temporary hours.” Each 
Egyptian month contained 30 
days and began with a festival. 
Each month gradually acquired 
the name of the festival with 
which it started. 

But this accounted for only 360 
days. .As for the remaining five 
days, the Egyptians decided that 
they were not worth much trouble, 
so they bunched them up at the 
end of the year and seem to have 
treated them as a holiday week. 

Simple, eh? 

In 238 B.C., Ptolemy Euergetes 



(not the Ptolemy, Claudius Pto- 
lemaeus) pointed out that, every 
four years, six days should be 
added instead of five, but his 
suggestion didn’t find any friends. 
Some two hundred years later, 
when Cajus Julius Caesar had 
decreed a calendar for the Roman 
Empire, the Egyptian officials, 
knowing what was good for them, 
finally consented to an extra day 
every four years. But not all 
Egyptians felt obliged to do so. 

W ITH all its shortcomings, 
the Egyptian calendar was 
the first “real” calendar, if that 
term is taken to mean a fixed 
scheme, a schedule, a time table 
upon which to base operations. 

By contrast, the Babylonian 
calendar, though probably older, 
was not “real.” It had a year of 
12 months, based on actual ob- 
servation of the Moon. A thirt- 
eenth month was added whenever 
it became necessary to get the 
lunar phases and the seasons to- 
gether again.* 



=*=The Mayan calendar, unnecessarily 
complicated by the introduction of 
Venus, has been highly overpublicizcd. 
It consisted of 18 months of 20 days 
with five or six “unlucky days” added, 
so unlucky that only unpostponable 
things like eating were done. It is true 
that it was accurate, but the Mayan 
system of counting was poor and the 
calendar so intricate that it was de- 
scribed as “wheels within wheels” by 
more critical archeologists.

Before Caesar issued his 
calendar decree in 46 B.C., the 
Romans had struggled along with 
a calendar of 355 days. Even that, 
believe it or not, had been an 
improvement. 

The original Roman calendar 
had consisted of fen lunar months, 
beginning the year with March 
and ending in December. The in- 
tervening period of about 60 days 
was simply neglected — why 
bother counting winter months? 
(The Vikings are said to have 
done the same, with a little more 
justification as to climate, I should 
think.) 

Then the Romans added Jan- 
uary and February at the end 
of the year, but this came out 
with a total of 354 days. Because 
even numbers were unlucky to 
the Romans, a 355th day was 
tacked on. 

Of course, this still did not 
make the seasons come out even- 
ly, so, every two years, an extra 
month was added. Its name was 
Mercedonius, which can best be 
translated as “extra pay” (for 
the legions) and to show that this 
was not a normal month, Exfra 
Pay began after February 23rd, 
running for 22 or 23 days, after 
which the last week of February 
finished up the year. 

Around 300 B.C., one Cneius 
Flavius changed things around a 
little more, making all months 
uneven so that they should be 



lucky, taking the needed days 
away from February to give it an 
even number of days (ours still 
remains 28) because the last 
month of the year should be un- 
lucky. 

So the year began with March 
of 31 days, followed by April 
with 29 days, May again had 
31 and June 29, Quintilis (the 
fifth month) again 31, Sextilis 
(the sixth) 29, September 29, 
October 3 1 , November, December 
and January 29 each and the 12th 
month, February, the same un- 
lucky 28. 

Every second year, of course, 
you had Mercedonius interrupt- 
ing February. Four years in suc- 
cession, then, had 355, 378, 355 
and 377 days, which made every 
year one day too long. 

In the middle of all this, they 
shifted the beginning of the year 
to January 1st, since this was 
the day newly elected consuls 
took office. The result is that 
October still means “the eighth” 
month, but it is actually the 
tenth, November, the “ninth,” is 
the eleventh and December, the 
“tenth,” is, of course, the twelfth. 

How’s that for sheer infuriat- 
ing mixup? 

C AESAR, having been elected 
Pontifex Maximus in 63 B.C., 
disliked a calendar in which two 
successive years could not be 
compared, either in military op-

erations or in tax collections. His 
model was the Egyptian calendar, 
with the "added daj^” evenly 
distributed throughout the year 
and an extra day every fourth 
year. 

Caesar, or maybe his advisors, 
thought that the solar year was 
365 days and 6 hours, making it 
about 11^ minutes too long, 
which is a lot. 

But the introduction of the 
new calendar was not enough. 
The spring equinox had mean- 
while strayed some 90 days from 
the date where it belonged. So 
Caesar took the year we now call 
46 B.c. 

It being a "long” year any- 
way, containing a 23-day Mer- 
cedonius, Caesar added two more 
“Decembers,” one of 33 and one 
of 34 days, stretching the year 
to 445 days. His enemies called it 
the “Year of Confusion,” to which 
the Caesar’s friends replied that 
it was the ‘Xast Year of Con- 
fusion.” 

When it was all over, the Senate 
decided to honor him by re- 
naming the month of his birth, 
Quintilis, after him— our July. 
Later, Sextilh was named after 
Augustus, but the old story that 
Augustus took a day from an- 
other month for his own month 
is a fable. The length of the 
months in Caesar’s calendar was 
the same as in ours, except that, 
in leap year, February acquired 



two 24th days, so that it might 
remain an unlucky month with an 
even number of days. 

The Romans not only gave us 
the names of the months, but also 
the names of the days, based on 
complicated astrological reason- 
ing. 

The seven astrological plan- 
ets were thought to influence the 
hours, with the most distant hav- 
ing first influence. So the first 
hour of a day would be influenced 
by Saturn, the next by Jupiter, 
the next by Mars, the next by 
the Sun and so on down the 
list through Venus, Mercury and 
the Moon. 

This cycle repeated twice, but 
there were still three hours left 
in the day for another repeat to 
start, so that the first hour of the 
next day would be “influenced” 
by the Sun. In the same manner, 
the Moon succeeded to the first 
hour of the third day, the planet 
Mars to the first hour of the 
fourth day, Mercury started the 
fifth, Jupiter the sixth and Venus 
the seventh day. The first hour 
of the next day was again ruled 
by Saturn and the cycle started 
over. 

All this did not originate in 
Rome. Some of these astrological 
ideas go back as far as there 
are records, but it was the Latin 
expression of these thoughts which 
resulted in the actual names of 
the days.

French differs from Latin only with respect to the name of Sunday, 
where Dieu (God) has been substituted for Sol (Sun). Modern Eng- 
Jish follows the Saxon system, using Sun and Moon and five Saxon 
gods, Tiw (T/oo), W^odan, Thor (or Donar) and Frigga (or Freya'), 
but the characteristics and attributes of these gods correspond closely 
to the Roman gods. (In Latin, of course, the word may refer to the 
god as well as to the planet.} 

The similarity between Saeter-daeg or Saturday and Dies Saturnis 
is accidental. Behind the Saxon name is the Norse divinity Saeter — 
although some etymologists consider the alternate (and more pro- 
saic} explanation of Thvatt-daeg as “wash day” or “bath day!” 
Modern German follows the same usage as Saxon except for 
Wednesday, which is Mittwoch (Middle of the Week}, and Saturday. 
The North German form Sonnabend means Sunday Eve; the South 
German form of Samstag is an adaptation of the French Samedi. 



S LOWLY, the much older week 
— a lunar month quartered in- 
to four weeks of seven days each 
— crept back into Caesar’s calen- 
dar and Emperor Constantine 
introduced it officially, replacing 
the older method of reckoning 
by the calends, nones and ides of 
the months. This interrupted the 
continuity that might otherwise 
have existed, for neither 365 nor 
366 is divisible by seven. Hence 
the new year did not start with 



the same weekday with which the 
previous year had begun. 

Moreover, as time went by, it 
turned out that the “Julian Year” 
itself did not fit precisely. Re- 
member that it was about 11^ 
minutes too long. That does not 
sound like much, but in the course 
of ten centuries, the error ac- 
cumulates to a very noticeable 
eight days. By the year 1580, 
the vernal equinox, put by Caesar 
on March 25th, had drifted to 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





March 1 1th. If this was not cor- 
rected somehow, Easter would 
land in mid-winter and all other 
holidays would be dislocated, too. 
It was clearly time for another 
revision. 

Pope Gregory XIII, after most 
careful consideration, cleared the 
matter up by issuing a papal bull 
which decreed that the day fol- 
lowing October 4, 1582, was to be 
called October 15th. This change 
brought the vernal equinox back 
to the 21st of March, where it had 
been in 325 a.d., the year of the 
Council of Nicaea, which had 
issued the rules for computing 
the date of Easter. 

To avoid a recurrence of the 
drifting of the vernal equinox, 
the leap year rule was modified. 
Caesar had decreed that every 
fourth year was a leap year. The 
papal bull added that full cen- 
turies could not be leap years, 
unless they were divisible by 400. 
The year 1600, then, was a leap 
year and the year 2000 will be 
one: but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were 
not. This correction of the leap 
year rule, coupled with the elimi- 
nation of ten days in 1582, con- 
stitutes what is now called the 
Gregorian calendar. Its average 
year works out as being 26 sec- 
onds longer than is accurate, but 
this error is so small that more 
than 33 centuries have to pass 
before a single day will have 
to be dropped. 



rilHE revision of the calendar 
was adopted at once in Italy, 
France, Spain, Portugal and Po- 
land. Holland, Flanders and the 
Catholic sections of Germany 
followed a year later. Protestant 
Germany refused and so did Eng- 
land, because the rule came from 
the Pope. Hungary followed suit 
in 1587. 

Switzerland presented the 
strangest picture, for there the 
revision was accepted canton by 
canton; for centuries, it was as if 
Connecticut had one calendar, 
Wisconsin another and Florida 
a third. The Catholic cantons 
accepted the revision at once, but 
the Protestant cantons stubbornly 
refused. 

In 1700, Denmark and Protes- 
tant Germany turned “Gre- 
gorian.” That pulled a few more 
cantons along. But the last of 
them did not yield until 1812, for 
they were stout Calvinists. They 
would not accept anything papal 
under any circumstances, but 
they found themselves forced to 
by commercial necessity and utter 
confusion. 

When England followed suit in 
1752, the discrepancy had grown 
into eleven days. Simultaneously, 
New Year’s Day was changed 
from March 25 to January 1st. 
There was rioting and there were 
stories that cattle still kneeled 
on “true Christmas,” but refused 
to kneel on “Papal Christmas”

England had no monopoly on 
calendar riots. Poland had ex- 
perienced them and so had some 
German states. People refused 
“to give up” eleven days of their 
lives. Of course the longer a coun- 
try waited, the more days had 
to be dropped. Japan experi- 
enced that in 1873, Albania in 
1912 and Rumania in 1924. The 
most sturdy opposition was found 
in Russia. 

For many centuries, Russia 
had lacked a calendar completely, 
the peasants getting along with 
reference to the Moon and to 
seasons, the educated people using 
a western calendar while in west- 
ern countries. 

The hrst Russian calendar is 
stated to have been written in 
1670 under the reign of -Czar 
Alexis Mikhailovitch. But it 
stayed in manuscript form. Under 
the reign of the next Czar, Peter 
the Great, the first printed Rus- 
sian calendar was published, 
naming Yakov Williamovitch 
Brus as the author. 



Unfortunately for Peter the 
Great and all the Russians, Yakov 
Williamovitch Bros was really 
James William Bruce, an Eng- 
lishman whose father had fled 
from Oliver Cromwell’s England 
and entered the Russian Civil 
Service. Consequently, the calen- 
dar was the Julian calendar, not 
the Gregorian revision. 

Around 1790, the Russian For- 
eign Office, the Merchant Marine 
and the Navy grew tired of put- 
ting two dates on every letter 
and asked for a change of policy. 
Prince Lieven was to submit the 
proposal to Czar Nicholas I, but 
Prince Lieven was worried be- 
cause he had heard about the 
English calendar riots. Russia 
couldn't afford riots. The matter 
languished until the Czar finally 
decided, in 1829, to forbid re- 
form. 

At a later date. Professor Dimi- 
tri Mendeleyeff, armed with the 
latest astronomical figures sup- 
plied by Simon Newcomb in 
Washington, did try to cause a 
reform, and he and his friends 
even formed a society for the 
purpose. But die old ukas stood; 
it needed the “October Revolu- 
tion” (which took place on No- 
vember 7) to bring about a re- 
vision. After a short period of 
investigation — some city soviets 
meanwhile wondered whether 
they should not use the French 
Revolutionary calendar — the offi- 



76 



GALAXY SCiiNCE FICTION 




cial Russian calendar jumped 13 
days. 

Oh, yes, that French Revolu- 
tionary calendar. Nothing ever 
miscarried so completely in so 
short a time. And it had not even 
been conceived by the revolution- 
ary parties! 

Though they coined the term 
“First Year of the Republic.” 
their calendar was ready more 
than one year preceding the revo- 
lution. It bore originally the name 
of Calendar of Honest Men and 
its author had been Monsieur 
Pierre Sylvain Marechal. As a 
piece of calendar-making, it was 
feeble indeed. There were 12 
months of 30 days apiece, each 
month subdivided into three dec- 
ades and five or six holidays, one 
after every second month, to be 
named after Honest Men. 

The King of France made the 
tactical error of ordering Mon- 
sieur Mar^chal’s almanac seized 
and burned, thereby calling at- 
tention to it. Since it seemed to 
be — or, better, could be made out 
to be — an early martyr of the 
revolution, it was later adopted. 

The revolutionary year began 
on the day declared to be the 
Birthday of the Republic, “by 
lucky coincidence, the day of the 
autumnal equinox, September 
22nd, old style.” The month be- 
ginning on that day was named 
Vendenniaire (Vintage), followed 
by Brumaire (Fog), Frimaire 



(Sleet), Nivose (Snow, beginning 
Dec. 21st), Pluviose (Rain) and 
Ventdse (Wind). The first of the 
spring months was Germinal 
(Seed, beginning March 21st). 
Floreal and Prairial (Blossom 
and Pasture) followed. The three 
summer months were the last of 
the year, named, in proper or- 
der, Messidor, Thermidor and 
Fiuctidor — Harvest, Heat and 
Fruit. 

I am not even certain whether 
Monsieur Marechal invented all 
these names himself. They bear 
much resemblance to the so- 
called German Peasant’s Calen- 
dar which is the Gregorian cal- 
endar with different names. 
December, for example, is Yule, 
January is Hartun^ (hard 
month), February is Hornung 
(because animals shed their 
“horns,” i.e., antlers), November 
is Nebelung (from Nebel, mean- 
ing fog, etc.) About half of these 
names are the same in meaning 
as those of the French revolu- 
tionary calendar. I suspect that 
French peasants may have used 
them before they got into print 
in 1788. 

The French revolutionary cal- 
endar was actually not used by 
the revolutionaries. Even their 
official Moniteur added the Gre- 
gorian dates for the sake of 
clarity. Napoleon threw it out in 
1806 to the extreme delight of 
everybody, friend and foe, and

nothing is left of it but a name 
on the menu : Lobster Thermidor. 

A CALENDAR^ like the Gre- 
gorian, which will not drift 
by more than a single day in 
3300 years, is a remarkable ac- 
complishment and nobody in his 
right mind ever suggested doing 
anything further to its main unit, 
the year. But there have been 
suggestions of rearranging the 
smaller units inside the year. 

The main problem is posed by 
the week. A normal year has 52 
weeks and one extra day; a leap 
year has 52 weeks and two extra 
days. As early as 1834, an Italian 
priest, the Abb^ Marco Mastro- 
hni, suggested that this extra day 
should simply be “removed” 
from the year so that the calendar 
year would consist of a year (of 
364 days) and a day — reminiscent 
of the British guinea, which is a 
pound and a shilling. 

If we tack one “bland day” 
at the end of each year (two at 
the end of a leap year), every 
year would begin with a Sunday 
and consequently every date 
would always fall on the same 
weekday. 

Father Mastrofini’s suggestion 
was taken up by the French 
Astronomical Society in 1887 . 
but in the meantime, a French 
philosopher, Auguste Comte, had 
confused the issue. In 1849, he 
published his plan for a 13-month 



calendar. Each . month was to 
have 28 days (the nearest thing to 
one lunation) dnd there were to 
be one (or two), blank days at 
the end of the year. It was an 
attempt to combine solar and 
lunar elements, but apparently 
Comte failed to realize that even 
if 13 months of 28 days were 13 
“moons,” the blank days would 
throw the calendar out of gear 
again as far as the lunar ele- 
ments were concerned. 

In addition to the 13 months, 
August Comte also proposed re- 
naming them after Moses, Aris- 
totle, Shakespeare, Buddha, Plato, 
Socrates, Newton, etc. Although 
rejected by almost everybody, the 
Comte calendar retained a small 
fellowship, presumably composed 
of f>eople who wanted to prove 
that they were not afraid of the 
figure 13. 

After the First World War, the 
proposal was revived under the 
sponsorship of George Eastman 
and dubbed the “businessman’s 
calendar.” Of course Eastman did 
not want Comte’s fancy names; 
he needed only a single new name, 
one for the 13th month. Merce- 
donius would have been especially 
suited for a businessman’s calen- 
dar, but the most serious con- 
tenders were Sol and Liberty. To 
most people, however, it was still 
a 13th month and they liked it 
even less when, with the fixed 
weekday dates, it turned out that 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




it produced a Friday the Thir- 
teenth thirteen times a year. 

W HAT was more important 
was that the thing simply 
was not practical. A 13-month 
calendar, no matter how well ad- 
vertised, is not a businessman’s 
calendar. One large firm is said 
to have used it internally for an 
experiment, with complete chaos 
resulting. The businessman wants 
to compare the first week of 
March in two years, or the first 
fall month of two years, and he 
is used to quarterly statements 
and semi-annual inventories or 
accountings. You cannot do that 
with a 13-month calendar unless 
you tear a month apart. 

A German “improvement,” the 
Blochmann calendar, suggested 
just that. It took the quarter as 
the important business unit, each 
quarter consisting of three months 
of 28 days each, plus one separate 
“unattached” week, called Spring, 
Summer, Fall and Winter Week, 
respectively. Plus one Year End 
day. Plus, every fourth year, one 
Leap-Year Day. 

The revision now under dis- 
cussion — it got as far as the 
United Nations — is the so-called 
World Calendar, which goes back 
to Mastrofini’s simple proposal, 
improved by an adjustment of the 
months. 

January is to have 31 days, 
February 30 and March 30. This 



rhythm of 31/30/30 repeats each 
quarter. Each 31-day month has 
five Sundays; every other month, 
four Sundays. January 1st is al- 
ways a Sunday and each quarter 
begins with a Sunday and ends 
with a Saturday. Not counting 
special holidays, every month has 
26 working days, if you count 
Saturdays and working days. But 
the holidays will always fall on 
the same weekday — July 4th on a 
Wednesday, for example. The 
extra day would be Year End 
Day between December 30th and 
January 1st. In leap years. Leap 
Year Day would come in the 
middle of the year, between June 
30th and July 1st. 

This World Calendar would be 
much more a businessman’s cal- 
endar than Eastman’s, which 
merely bore that name. 

The adoption of the World Cal- 
endar is opposed on principle by 
three religious groups: the Sev- 
enth Day Adventists, the Seventh 
Day Baptists and Orthodox Juda- 
ism. But the example of Orthodox 
Judaism shows how discrepancies 
between everyday necessity and 
religious convictions can be over- 
come, namely by following one 
calendar for everyday business 
and another for religious pur- 
poses. 

No room for letters and dis- 
cussions this month. They’ll be 
back in the February issue.

I can’t recall having 
formulated that precept; I do 
know I’ve lived under it all my 
life. 

But Henry? 

It couldn’t matter with Henry. 

You might say Henry didn’t 
count. 

And who would blame me? 
Being me, I’d found, was a lonely 
job. Doing better things than oth- 
er people — and doing them bet- 
ter to boot — is its own reward, 
up to a point. But to find out

ens and dozens of beautiful scot- 
free murders, and then not to be 
able to tell anyone . well, I 
act like a human being in so many 
other ways — 

And besides, it’s only Henry. 

When I was a kid in school, I 
had three miles to go and used 
roller skates except when it was 
snowing. Sometimes it got pretty 
cold, occasionally too hot, and 
often wet; but rain or shine, 
Henry was there when I got to

years ago, but all I have to do 
is close my eyes to bring it all

face, his odd flexible mouth atwist 
with laughter and welcome. He’d 
take my books and set them by 
the wall and rub one of my hands 
between his two if it was cold, or 
toss me a locker-room towel if it 
was wet or very hot. 

I never could figure out why 
he did it. It was more than just 
plain hero-worship, yet Lord 
knows he got little enough from 
me. 

^T^HAT went ou for years, un- 
til he graduated. I didn’t do 
so well and it took me longer to 
get out. I don’t think I really 
tried to graduate until after Hen- 
ry did; the school suddenly seem- 
ed pretty bleak, so I did some 
work and got clear of it. 

After that, I kicked around a 
whole lot looking for a regular 
income without specializing in 
anything, and found it writing 
features for the Sunday supple- 
ment of one of those newspapers 
whose editorial policies are ab- 
horrent to decent people, but it’s 
all right; no decent person reads 
them. 

1 write about floods, convinc- 
ingly describing America’s cer- 
tain watery grave, and I write 
about drought and the vanishing 
water table, visualizing our 
grandchildren expiring on barren 
plains that are as dry as a pota- 
to-chip. Then there’s the peren- 
nial collision with a wandering 



planet, and features about nuts 
who predicts the end of the world, 
and biographies of great patriots 
cut to size so they won’t conflict 
with the editorial page. It’s a 
living, and when you can com- 
partment it away from what you 
think, none of it bothers you. 

So a lot of things happened 
and twenty years went by, and 
all of a sudden I ran into Henry. 

The first funny thing about him 
was that he hadn’t changed. I 
don’t think he had even grown 
much. He still had the coarse hair 
and the ugly wide mouth and the 
hot happy eyes. The second fun- 
ny thing was the way he was 
dressed, like always, in hand-me- 
downs: a collar four sizes too 
large, a baggy suit, a raveled 
sweater that would have fought 
bitterly with his old herringbone 
if both weren’t so faded. 

He came wagging and panting 
up to me this early fall day when 
everyone in sight but Henry was 
already wearing a topcoat. I knew 
him right away and I couldn’t 
help myself; I just stood there 
and laughed at him. He laughed, 
too, glad to the groveling point, 
not caring why I was laughing, 
but simply welcoming laughter 
for its own sake. He said my 
name indistinctly, again and 
again; Henry almost always 
spoke indistinctly because of that 
grin he wore half around his 
head.

“Well, come on!” I bellowed 
at him, and then cussed at him. 
It always made him wince, and 
it did now. ‘Til buy you a drink. 
I’ll buy you nine drinks!” 

“No,” he said, smiling, back- 
ing away a little, bobbing his 
head in that funny way, as if he 
was about to duck. “I can’t right 
now.” 

It seemed to me he was look- 
ing at my sharp-creased dacron 
suit, or maybe the pearl hom- 
burg. Or maybe he just caught 
my eye on his old set of threads. 
He waggled his hands aimlessly 
in front of him, like an old wo- 
man caught naked and not know- 
ing what to cover up. “I don’t 
drink.” 

“You’ll drink,” I said. 

I took him by the wrist and 
marched him down to the cor- 
ner and into Molson’s, while he 
tugged ineffectually at me and 
mumbled things from between^his 
solid, crooked teeth. I wanted a 
drink and I needed a laugh, right 
now, and I wasn’t going to drag 
all the way down to Skid Row 
just to keep him from feeling con- 
spicuous. 

S OMEBODY was sitting in a 
back booth — someone I es- 
pecially didn’t want to see. Be 
seen by. I don’t think I broke 
stride when I saw her, though. 
Hell, the day won’t come when I 
can’t handle the likes of her . 



“Siddown,” I said, and Henry 
had to; I pushed him and the 
edge of the seat hit the backs of 
his knees. I sat down, too, giving 
him the hip hard enough to slide 
those worn old tweeds of his back 
into the corner where he would- 
n’t be able to get out unless I 
moved first. “Steve!” I roared, 
just as though I didn’t care if 
anyone in the place knew I was 
there. Steve was on his way, but 
I always yelled like that; it both- 
ered him. Steve’s also sort of a 
funny guy. 

“Awright, awright,” he com- 
plained. “What’ll you have?” 
“What are you drinking, 
Henry?” 

“Oh, nothing — nothing for me.” 
I snorted at him and said to 
Steve, “Two sour-mash an’ soda 
on the side.” 

Steve grunted and went away. 
“Really,” Henry said, with his 
maybe-I-better-duck wobble, “I 
don’t want any. I don’t drink.” 
“Yes, you do,” I told him. 
“Now what’s with you? Come 
on, right from the beginning. 
From school. I want the story 
of your life — trials and triumphs, 
toils ’n’ tragedies.” 

“My life?” he asked, and I 
think he was genuinely puzzled. 
“Oh, I haven’t done anything. I 
work in a store,” he added. When 
I just sat there shaking my head 
at him, he looked down at his 
hands and pulled them abruptly

down into his lap as if he was 
ashamed of the nails. “I know, I 
know, it’s nothing much.” He 
looked at me with that peculiar 
hot gaze. “Not like you, with a 
piece in the paper every week 
and all.” 

Steve came with the bourbon. 
I shut up until he’d gone. With 
Steve, I like to pretend I have 
big business and don’t trust him 
to listen in. I swear sometimes 
you can hear him grinding his 
teeth. He never says anything, 
though. A good customer’s got 
just a little more rights than just 
anybody else, so there’s nothing 
he can do about it. He just works 
there. 

When he’d gone, I said, “Here’s 
to the twist that don’t exist, and 
her claim thefe’s a game that 
can’t be played. Here’s to the 
wise old lies we use — ” 

“Honest, I don’t want any,” 
said Henry. 

“If I’m going to be hospitable, 
you’re going to be housebroke,” 
I told him, and picked up his 
glass and shoved it at his face. 

He got his lips on it just in 
time to keep it from falling into 
that oversize collar. He didn’t 
take but a sip, and that great big 
mouth snapped down to button- 
size as if it had a drawstring on 
it. His eyes got round and filled 
with tears; he tried to hold the 
liquor on his tongue, but he 
sneezed through his nostrils and 



swallowed and started to cough. 

Laugh? I got my breath back 
just this side of hernia. Some 
day I’ll plant a sound camera 
and do that again and make an 
immortal out of old Henry. 

“Gosh!” he gasped when he 
could. 

TTE wiped his eyes with his 
frayed sleeves. I guess he 
didn’t have a handkerchief. “That 
hurt." But he was grinning the 
old grin all the same. “You drink 
that all the time?” he half whisp- 
ered. 

“All the time, like so,” I said, 
and drank the rest of his, “and 
like so,” and drank mine down. 
“Steve!” Steve already had the 
refills on a tray and I knew it, 
which is why I yelled at him. 
“Now about what you started to 
say — ” and I broke off while 
Steve got to the table and put 
down the drinks and picked up 
the empties and went away again 
— “the story of your life. You 
sit there and tell me ‘Oh, noth- 
ing,’ and you say you work in a 
store, period. Now / am going 
to tell you the story of your life. 
First of all. I’m going to tell you 
who you are. You’re Henry. No- 
body else in God’s great gray- 
green Universe was ever this par- 
ticular Henry. We start with that. 
No—” 

Henry said, “But I — ” 

“No mountain,” I went on, “no

spitting nucleus was ever more 
remarkable than the simple fact 
of you, Henry, just being Henry. 
Name me an earthquake, an oak 
tree, a racehorse or a Ph.D. the- 
sis and I will, by God, name you 
one just like it that happened be- 
fore. You,” I said, leaning for- 
ward and jamming my forefinger 
into his collarbone, “you, Henry, 
are unique and unprecedented on 
this planet in this galaxy.” 

“No. I’m not,” he laughed, 
backing off from the finger, which 
did him no good once I had him 
pinned to the wall behind him. 

‘‘No §upernova,” I said again, 
having just discovered that the 
phrase is a delightful way of 
sending the flavor of good bour- 
bon through the nostrils. ‘‘That’s 
what we only begin with,” I went 
on. ‘‘Just by being, you’re a mir- 
acle, aside from everything you’ve 
ever said or done or dreamed 
about.” I took away the finger 
and sat back to beam at him. 

“Ah,” he said; I swear he 
blushed. “Ah, there’s plenty more 
like me.” 

“Not a single one.” I tipped up 
my glass, found it was empty al- 
ready, so drank his because I 
had my mouth all set for it. 
“Steve!” I sat silently watching 
Henry aimlessly rubbing his col- 
larbone while the drinks arrived 
and the empties left. “So we start 
with a miracle. Where do we go

that?” 

He made a sort of giggle. It 
meant, “I don’t know.” 

“You never heard anybody talk 
like this about you before, did 
you?” 

“No.” 

“All right.” I put out the fore- 
finger again, but did not touch 
him with it because he expected 
I would. 

1~VVER his shoulder, in the wall 
mirror, I could see that wo- 
man sitting alone in the back 
booth, crying. Always a great one 
for crying, she was. 

“I’ll tell you why I talk like 
this, Henry,” I said. “It’s for 
your own good, because you don’t 
know what you are. Here you 
walk around the place telling peo- 
ple ‘Oh, nothing’ when they ask 
for the story of your life, and 
you’re a walking miracle just to 
start with. Now what do we go 
on with?” 

He shrugged. 

“You feel better, now you 
know what you are?” 

“I don’t ... I never thought 
about it.” He looked up at me 
swiftly, as if to find out what I 
wanted him to say. “I guess I 
do.” 

“All right then. That makes it 
better. That makes it easier on 
you, because I am now going to 
tell you what you are, Henry. 

85 




Henry, what are you?” 

“Well, you said — ” he swal- 
lowed — “a miracle.” 

I brought down my fist with a 
bang that made everybody jump, 
even her in the mirror, but es- 
pecially Henry. “No! I’ll tell you 
what you are. You are a nowhere 
type, a nudnick type nothing!” 
I quickly bent forward. He shrank 
from the finger like a snail from 
salt. “And now you’re going to 
tell me that’s a paradox. You’re 
going to say I contradicted my- 
self." 

“I’m not.” His mouth trem- 
bled and then he was smiling 
again. 

“Well, all right, but it’s what 
you’re thinking. Drink up.” I 
raised my glass. “Here’s to the 
eyes, blue brown and brindle, 
and here’s to the fires that those 
eyes kindle; I don’t mean the 
fires that bum down shanties, I 
mean the fires that pull down — ” 
“Gee, no, thanks," he said. 

I drank my drink. “But I 
mean,” I said aloud to myself, 
“really a nothing.” I took his 
drink and held it and glared at 
him. “You will, by God, stop 
stepping on my punchlines.” 

“I’m sorry. I didn’t even no- 
tice.” He pointed vaguely. “I 
didn’t know anyone could handle 
so much of that — that whiskey.” 
“I got news for you, boy,” I 
said, and winked at him. “Here it 
is past quitting time and this 



whiskey is all I had for lunch, 
and it’s what I had for a snack — 
high tea, wot? — and it’s what 
I’m having for dinner, and well 
should you envy this mighty ca- 
pacity. Among other things. Now 
I will show you why I have ut- 
tered no paradox in describing 
you as a miracle and as a simul- 
taneous, coexistent, concurrent 
nothing.” 

1 SMELLED his drink and low- 
ered it. “You started out being 
everything I described — unique, 
unprecedented. If you thought 
about it at all, which I doubt, 
you thought of yourself as hav- 
ing been born naked and defense- 
less, and having gained constant- 
ly since — the power of speech, the 
ability to read, an education of 
sorts (you can see by my calling 
it that that I’m in a generous 
mood) and, lately, some sort of a 
job in some sort of a store, the 
right to vote, and that . well, 
unusual suit you’re wearing. No 
matter how modest you are about 
these achievements — and you are, 
you really are — they seem to add 
up to more than you started with. 

“Well, they don’t. Since the 
day you were born, you’ve lost. 
What the hell is it that you keep 
looking at?” 

“That girl. She’s crying. But 
I’m listening to what you’re say- 
ing.” 

“You better listen. I’m doing 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




this for you, for your own good. 
Just let her cry. If she cries long 
enough, she’ll find out crying 
doesn’t help. Then she’ll quit.” 

“You know why she’s crying?” 

rvlD I! "Yes, and it’s a pretty 
useless procedure. Where 
was I ?” 

“I've been losing since I was 
born,” Henry obediently remind- 
ed me. 

“Yeah, yeah. What you’ve lost 
is potential, Henry. You started 
out with the capability of doing 
almost anything and you've come 
to a point where you can do al- 
most nothing. On the other hand, 
I started out being able to do 
practically nothing and now I can 
do almost anything.” 

“That’s wonderful!” he said 
warmly, 

“You just don’t know,” I told 
him. "Now, mind you, we’re still 
talking about you. You’ll see the 
connection. I just want to illus- 
trate a point . These days, ev- 
erybody specializes or doesn’t 
make it, one or the other; If you’re 
lucky enough to have a talent 
and find work where you use it, 
you go far. If your work is out- 
side your talent, you can still 
make out. If you have no talent, 
hard work in one single line 
makes for a pretty fair substitute. 
But in each case, how good you 
are depends on how closely you 
sp>ecialize and how hard you work 



inside a specialty. Me, now. I’m 
different. Stevef" 

“None for me,” Henry insisted 
plaintively. 

“Do it again, Steve. Henry, 
stop interrupting when I’m doing 
you a favor. What I am. I’m what 
you might call a specializing non- 
specialist. We’re few and far be- 
tween, Henry — guys like me, I 
mean. Far as work’s concerned, 
I got a big bright red light in 
here — ” I tapped my forehead 
— “that lights up if I accidental- 
ly stay in one line too long. Any 
time that happens, I quick wind 
up what I’m doing and go do 
something else instead. And far 
as talents are concerned, talents 
I got, I guess. Only I don’t use 
’em, I avoid ’em. They’re the 
only thing that could ever trap 
me into specializing and I just 
won’t be trapped, not by anybody 
or anything. Not me!” 

“You have a real talent for 
writing,” Henry said diffidently. 

“Well, thanks, Henry, but 
you’re wrong. Writing isn’t a tal- 
ent. It’s a skill. Certain kinds of 
thinking, ways of thinking — you 
might call them based on talent; 
but writing’s just a verbalization, 
a knack of putting into an ac- 
cepted code what’s already there 
in your head. Learning to write 
is like learning to type, a trans- 
formation of a sort of energy in- 
to a symbol. It’s what you write 
that counts, not how you do it. 



WHEN YOU'RE SMILING 



87 




What’s the matter, did I lose 
you?” 

He was looking out into the 
room over my shoulder and smil- 
ing. “She’s still crying.” 

“Forget it. Every day, women 
lose their husbands. They get ov- 
er it.” 

“Lose — Her husband’s dead?” 

“Altogether.” 

TTE looked again and I watch- 
ed his wide mouth, the show 
of strong, uneven teeth. I couldn’t 
blame him. She’s a very unusual- 
looking girl and here the coast 
was clear. I wondered next what 
you’d ever say to Henry so he 
wouldn’t smile. 

Then he was looking at me 
again. “You were talking about 
your writing,” he said. 

“Oh. Now suppose, Henry, you 
had the assignment to write a 
piece every week and you wrote 
every single one so the man who 
reads it believes it. And suppose 
one piece says: ‘The world will 
end.’ And another one says: ‘The 
world will not end.’ One says: 
‘No man is good. He can only 
struggle against his natural evil.’ 
And another says: ‘No amount 
of evil can alter the basic good- 
ness of human beings.’ See what 
I mean? Yet every single word 
of every piece comes out like a 
revelation. The whole series just 
stinks of truth. Would you say 
that you, the writer of all this 



crud, believes or does not believe 
in what he writes?” 

‘Well, I guess ... I don’t know. 
I mean I — ” He looked into my 
eyes swiftly, trying again to dis- 
cover what I wanted him to say. 
“Well,” he said clumsily, when 
I just sat and wouldn’t help, “if 
you, I mean I, writing that way, 
if I said white was white and then 
it was blue . well, I guess I 
couldn’t believe ’em both?” His 
voice put the question mark shy- 
ly at the end and he pretended 
to duck. 

“You mean to say that kind 
of writer doesn’t believe anything 
he writes. Well, I knew you were 
going to say that, and you’re one 
hundred and three per cent 
wron^." And I leaned forward 
and glared at him. 

He looked into his lap. “I’m 
sorry.” Then, “He believes some 
of it?” 

“No!” 

“Oh,” Henry said. Miserably, 
he moved his glass an inch to 
the left. I took it away from him. 

I said.^'A writer like that learns 
to believe everything he writes 
about. Sure, white is white. But 
look: go down as far as you can 
into the microscopic, and still 
down, and what do you find? 
Measurements that can only be 
approximated; particles that are- 
n’t particles at all, but only places 
where there is the greatest prob- 
ability of an electric charge . 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




in other words, an area where 
nothing is fact, where nothing be- 
haves according to the rules we 
set up for the proper behavior of 
facts. 

“Now go up in the other direc- 
tion, out into space, farther than 
our biggest telescopes can reach, 
and what do you find? Same 
thing! The incommensurable, the 
area of possibility and probabili- 
ty, where the theoretical compu- 
tation (that’s scientese for ‘wild 
guess’) is acceptable mathemat- 
ics. So okay: all these years, 
we’ve been living as if white was 
white and a neat a plus b equals 
a respectable c. 

“There might be an excuse 
for that before we knew that in 
the microcosm and in the mac- 
rocosm all the micrometers are 
made of rubber and the tape- 
measures are printed on wet mac- 
aroni. But we do know that now; 
so by what right do we assume 
that everything’s vague up there 
and muzzy down yonder, but 
everything here is all neat as a 
pin and dusted every day? I 
maintain that nothing is alto- 
gether anything: that nothing 
proves anything, nothing follows 
from anything; nothing is really 
real, and that the idea we live 
in a tidy filling of a mixed-up 
sandwich is a delusion. 

“But you can’t go around not 
believing in reality and at the 
same time do your work and get 

WHEN YOU'RE SMILINO 



your pay. So the only alternative 
is to believe everything you run 
into, everything you hear, and 
especially everything you think.” 

IjrENRY said, “But I—” 

“Shut up. Now, belief — 
faith, if you like — is a peculiar 
thing. Knowledge helps it along, 
but at the same time it can only 
exist in the presence of ignorance. 
I hold as an axiom that complete 
— really complete — information 
on any given subject would de- 
stroy belief in it. It’s only the 
gaps between the steppingstones 
of logic that leave room for the 
kind of ignorance called intui- 
tion, without which the mind 
can’t move. So back we come to 
where we started: by not spe- 
cializing in anything. I am guard- 
ing my ignorance, and as long 
as I keep that ignorance at a 
certain critical level, I can say 
anything or hear anything and 
believe it. So living is a lot of 
fun and I have more fun than 
anybody.” 

Henry smiled broadly and 
shook his head in deep admira- 
tion. “I’m glad if it’s so, I mean, 
you’re happy.” 

“What do you mean, if? I get 
what I want. Henry: I always 
get what I want. If that isn’t be- 
ing happy, what is?” 

“I wouldn’t know.” Henry clos- 
ed his eyes a moment and then 
said again, “I wouldn’t know . 

89 




Let me out, would you?’'*' 

“You going some place? I’m 
not through with you, Henry, me 
boy. I don’t be^in to be through 
with you.” 

He looked wistfully at the 
door and, without moving, seem- 
ed to sigh. Then he smiled again. 
“I just want to, uh, you know.” 

“Oh, that. The used beer de- 
partment is down those steps over 
there.” I got up and let him by. 
There was no way out of Mol- 
son’s except past me; he wouldn’t 
get away. 

Why shouldn’t he get away? 

Because he made me feel good, 
that’s why. There was something 
about Henry, a sort of hair-trig- 
ger dazzle effect, that was pretty 
engaging. Recite the alphabet to 
him and I swear he’d look daz- 
zled. Not that the line I’d been 
slinging wouldn’t dazzle anyone. 

It was just then I decided to 
tell him about the murderer. 

The room tilted suddenly and 
I hung to the edges of the table 
and stopped it. I recognized the 
sympton. Better get something 
to eat before soaking up any 
more of that sour-mash. I didn’t 
want to get offensive. 

Just then I felt, rather than 
heard, a sort of commotion. I 
looked up. Henry, that damn 
fool, was leaning with his palms 
on the table where what’s-her- 
name sat, the one who cried all 
the time. I saw her glance up and 



then her face went all twisted. 
She sprang up and fetched him 
one across the chops that half 
spun him around. Next thing you 
know, she was through the door, 
with Henry staring after her and 
grinning and slowly rubbing his 
face. 

“Henry!” 

r^URNING my way, Henry 
looked again at the door, then 
came shambling over. 

“Henry, you ol’ wolf, you’ve 
been holding out on me,” I said. 
“Since when have you been chas- 
ing tomatoes?” 

He just sat down heavily and 
fondled his cheek. “Gosh!” 

“Whyn’t you tell me you want- 
ed to make a pass? I’d have 
saved you the trouble. She won’t 
be good for anything for weeks 
yet. She can’t think of anything 
but — ” 

“It wasn’t anything like that. 
I just asked her if there was any- 
thing I could do. She didn’t seem 
to hear me, so I asked her again. 
Then she got mad and hit me. 
That’s all.” 

I laughed at him. “Well, you 
probably did her a favor. She’s 
better off mad at something than 
sitting there tearing herself apart. 
What made you think you could 
get to first base with her, any- 
way?” 

He grinned and shook his head. 
“I told you, honest I didn’t want 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




anything, only to see if I could 
help.” He shrugged. “She was 
crying,” he said, as if that ex- 
plained something. 

“So what’s in it for you?” 

He shook his head. 

“I thought so!” I banged him 
on the shoulder. “That’s where 
we’ll start, Henry. We’re going to 
make you over, that’s what we’re 
going to do. We’re going to get 
you out of oversize second-hand 
shirts and undersize Boy Scouts 
ideas. We’re going to find out 
what you really want and then 
we’re going to see that you learn 
how to get it.” 

“But I’m all — I mean I don’t 
really — ” 

“Shut up! And the first and 
rock-bottom basic and important 
thing you’ll learn till you’re blue 
in the face is, never do nothing 
for nothing. In other words, al- 
ways ask ‘What’s in it for me?’ 
and do nothing about anything 
until the answer comes up ‘Plen- 
ty!’ Steve! The check! That way 
you’ll always have a new wallet 
to put in your new suit and no- 
body, especially girls, is going to 
clobber you in a filthy joint like 
this.” 

Actually it wasn’t a filthy joint, 
but Steve came up just then and 
I wanted him to hear me say it. 
I gave him what the check said, 
to the penny, and told him to 
keep the change. Once in a while, 
I’d tip Steve — not .often — and 



then I’d make it a twenty or bet- 
ter. What he didn’t know was, 
if you total all the bills and all 
the tips, the tips came out to ex- 
actly nine per cent. Either he’d 
find that out for himself some 
day or I’d tell him; one way or 
the other, it would be fun. The 
secret of having fun is to pay at- 
tention to the details. 

Out on the street, Henry stop- 
ped and shuffled his feet. “Well, 
good-by.” 

“Good-by nothing. You’re 
coming home with me.” 

“Oh,” he said, “I can’t. I got 
t(^— ” 

“You got to what? Come on 
now, Henry — whether you know 
it or not, you need help; whether 
you like it or not, you’re going to 
get it. Didn’t I say I was going 
to tear you down and make you 
over?” 

TTE stepped to the right and he 
stepped to the left. “I can’t 
be taking up your time. I’ll just 
go on home.” 

I suddenly saw that if I could- 
n’t change his mind, the only way 
I’d get him to come along would 
be to carry him. I could do it, 
but I didn’t feel like it. There’s 
always a better way than hard 
work. 

“Henry,” I said, and paused. 

He waited, not quite jittering, 
not exactly standing still. Guys 
like Henry, they can’t fight and 



WHEN YOU’RE SMILING 



91 




they can’t run; you can do what- 
ever you want with them. So— 
think. Think of the right thing 
to say. I did, and 1 said it. 

“Henry,” I said, real sudden, 
real soft, sincere, and the change 
must have hit him harder than 
a yell, “I’m in terrible trouble 
and you’re about the only man 
in the world I can trust.” 

“Gosh.” He came a little closer 
and peered up at me in the thick- 
ening twilight. “Why didn’t you 
say so?” 

Sticking out the marrow of his 
soul, every man has an eyebolt. 
All you have to do is find it and 
drop your hook in. This was 
Henry’s. I almost laughed, but 
I didn’t. I turned away and sigh- 
ed. “It’s a long story . but I 
shouldn’t bother you with it. 
Maybe you’d better — ” 

“No. Oh, no. I’ll come.” 
“You’re a pal, Henry,” I whis- 
pered, and swallowed as noisily 
as I could. 

We walked down to the park 
and started across it. I walked 
slowly and kept my eyes on the 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





middle distance, like a hired 
mourner, while Henry trotted 
alongside, looking anxiously up 
into my face every once in a 
while. 

“Is it about that girl?” he asked 
after a while. 

“No,” I said. “She’s no trou- 
ble.” 

“Her husband. What happen- 
ed to him?” 

“Same thing that happened to 
the ram who didn’t see the ewe 
turn.” I hit him with my elbow. 
“U-turn, get it? Anyway, he drove 
over a cliff.” We were passing un- 
der a street light at the time and 
I saw Henry’s face. “Some day 
you’re going to split your head 
plumb in two just by grinning. 
What do you go around showing 
your teeth for all the time, any- 
way?” 

He said, “I’m sorry.” And when 
we were almost through the 
park, “Why?” 

“Why what?” I asked vacant- 
ly- 

“The husband . over the 
cliff.” 



“Oh. Well, she had a sort of 
a roll in the hay with somebody, 
and when she told him, he up 
and knocked himself off. Some 
people take themselves pretty 
seriously. Here we are.” I led 
him up the walk and through 
the herculite doors. In the eleva- 
tor, he gulped around at the 
satinwood paneling. “This is 
nice.” 

“Keeps the rain off,” I said 
modestly. The doors slid open 
and I led the way down the hall 
and kicked open my door. “Come 
on in.” 

I N we went and there, of course, 
stood Loretta with The Look 
on her face, the damned anger 
always expressed as hurt. So I 
pushed Henry ahead of me and 
watched The Look be replaced 
by tight Company Manners. 

“My wife,” I told Henry. 

He stepped back and I pushed 
him forward again. He grinned 
and bobbed his head and wagged 
his figurative tail. “Huh-huh- 
huh — ” he said, swallowed, and 



WHEN YOU'RE SMILING 



93 



tried again. “Huh-how do?” 

“It’s Henry, my old school pal 
Henry that I told you about, 
Loretta.” I’d never told her a 
thing. “He’s hungry. I’m hungry. 
How’s for some food?” Before 
she could answer, I asked, “A 
couple paper plates in the den 
would be less trouble than set- 
ting the table, hm?” and at this 
she must nod, so I shoved Henry 
toward the den and said, “Fine, 
and thanks, oh, best of good wo- 
men,” which made her nod a 
promise. We went in and I closed 
the double doors and leaned 
against them, laughing. 

“Gosh,” said Henry, his eyes 
heating up. “You never told me 
you had a — uh — were married.” 
The smile flickered, then blazed. 

“Guess I didn’t. One of those 
things, Henry. The air you 
breathe, a post-nasal drip, the 
way you walk from here to 
the office — same thing. Part 
of the picture. Why talk about 
it?” 

“Yes, but maybe she . maybe 
it’s trouble for her. Why are you 
laughing?” 

I was laughing because of the 
change in Loretta’s face as we 
had come in. I was late and din- 
ner was ruined, and I’d been 
drinking to boot; and primed as 
she was to parade hurt feelings 
all over the apartment, she hadn’t 
expected me to bring anyone 
home. Ah, Loretta; so mannered, 



so polite! She’d have died rather 
than show her feelings before a 
stranger, and to see her change 
from hostility to hospitality in 
three point five seconds was, to 
me, very funny. There’s always 
a way of getting out from under. 
All you have to do is think of it. 
In time. 

“I’m laughing,” I told Henry, 
“at the idea of Loretta’s having 
trouble.” 

“You mean I’m no bother?” 
“I mean you make everything 
all right. Sit down.” 

He did. “She’s pretty.” 

“Wh — oh. Loretta. Yep, noth- 
ing but the best. Henry, I am a 
man different from all other 
men.” 

He fumbled with some facial 
expressions and came up with a 
slow grinning puzzlement. “Isn’t 
everybody?” he asked timidly. 

“Yes, you idiot. But by dif- 
ferent, I mean really different. 
Not necessarily better,” I added 
modestly. “Just different.” 

“How do you mean, different?” 
Good old Henry. What a straight 
man! 

Y way of answering him, I 
^ took out my key-case, zip- 
ped it open, thumbed out the 
flat brass key of my filing drawer 
and dangled it. “I’ll show you, 
soon as we have something in our 
stomachs and no interruptions.” 
“Is this the . the trouble

you said you were in, you want- 
ed my help?” 

“It is, but it’s so strictly pri- 
vate and confidential that I don’t 
want you even thinking about it 
until I can lock that door and 
go into detail.” 

“Oh,” he said. “All right.” Vis- 
ibly, he cast about for something 
else to talk about. “Can I ask you 
something about that girl who 
was . whose husband . .” 
“Fire away,” I said. “Not that 
it matters. You have the damned- 
est knack, Henry, of combining 
the gruesome with the trivial.” 
“I’m sorry. She seemed so, 
well, sad. What was it you said, 
I don’t think I understood it?” 
His voice supplied the question 
mark to his odd phrasing. “She 
and somebody . .” His words 
trailed off and he went pink. 
“And her husband found out — ” 
“She sure did. And he didn’t 
exactly find out; she told him. 
She was mixed up in some re- 
search, see. Field-test of a new 
drug, a so-called hypnotic. So 
there she was, awake and aware 
and absolutely subject to any 
and all suggestions. And as you 
saw for yourself, she’s not a bad- 
looking chick, not bad at all. So 
nature just took its course. Carpe 
diem, as the Romans used to say, 
which means drill not and ye 
strike no oil.” 

He looked at me foggily, but 
smiling broadly, too. “The re- 



searcher, the one who gave her 
the drug. But that wasn’t exactly 
her fault. I mean her husband 
didn’t have to—” 

“Her husband did have to,” 
I mimicked, “being what he was. 
One of those idealistic, love-is- 
sacred characters, who, besides 
all this, was sensitive about the 
side of his face he left in Korea. 
“Love,” I said, harpooning 
Henry’s collarbone with my fin- 
ger again, “is cornflakes.” 

I leaned back. “Besides, he 
had no way of knowing how it 
happened. This drug, it’s some- 
thing like sodium amytal, though 
chemically unrelated. You know, 
‘truth serum!’ Only it doesn’t 
leave the subject groggy or 
doped. She went straight home, 
walking and talking just like al- 
ways, and incapable of conceal- 
ing what had happened. She 
didn’t even know she’d been — 
ah — medicated. It was in her cof- 
fee. All she could say. was that 
such-and-such had happened to 
her and it was all so easy that, 
from now on, she could never 
know when it might happen 
again. He chewed on it for most 
of the night and then got up and 
got in his car and drove over the 
cliff.” 

H enry smiled twice, one 
smile right on top of the 
other. “Now all she does is drink 
in bars?” 



WHEN YOU'RE SMILING

“She doesn’t drink. Ever read 
that William Irish book, Phan- 
tom Lady, Henry? There’s a girl 
in there who cracks a character 
just by haunting him — by being 
there, wherever he is, day and 
night, for weeks. This chick in 
the bar, in her goofed-off ineffec- 
tual way, is trying to do the same 
thing to me. She sits where I can 
see her and hates me. 'And cries.” 
'‘You?" 

I winked at him and made a 
^iddap sort of cluck-cluck with 
my back teeth. “Research, Henry. 
A scientific project. It covers a 
multitude. And covering multi- 
tudes is a happy hobby, especial- 
ly if you do it one by one. Sure, 
I know chemistry — told you I 
was a specializing non-specialist. 
Now wipe that grin off your face 
or you won’t be able to chew: 
here comes the food.” 

Loretta carried in a tray. But- 
ter-fried shrimp with piquant 
orange sauce, a mixed-greens 
salad with shallots and grated 
nuts, and an Arabian honey-cake. 

“Oh!” gulped Henry, and 
bounced to his feet. “Oh, that’s 
just beautiful, Mrs. — ” 

“You didn’t bring a drink first, 
but I guess we can have it along 
with the food.” I said. 

“I don’t want any, really,” 
Henry. 

“He’s being polite. We don’t 
let our guests be polite, do we, 
Lorrie?” 



For a moment, she had only 
one lip because she had sucked 
in the lower one to bite on. Then 
she said, “I’m sorry. I’ll mix — ” 
“Don’t mix,” I told her. “Bring 
the bottle. We wouldn’t think of 
troubling you any more, would 
we, Henry?” 

“I really don’t want — ” 

“Right away, cfarling.” Two 
out of five times when I say 
darling, I roar at her. She set the 
tray down on the coffee table and 
fairly scurried out. I laughed. 
“Wonderful, wonderful. She 
doesn’t exactly hide the liquor, 
but she sure tidies it away. Now, 
by God, she’ll bring it to me.” 

I could actually hear the soft 
sound at the corners of Henry’s 
mouth as his smile stretched it. 

Loretta came back and I took 
the bottle. “No chaser; we’re men 
in here. Okay, darling, you can 
leave the dishes here for the 
night.” 

She wouldn’t back to the door 
and she wouldn’t — maybe she 
was frightened just then — she 
wouldn’t take her eyes off me, so 
she got out sidewise, not forget- 
ting to flip the crumpled frag- 
ment of a hostess’s smile to 
Henry. 

Henry was saying, “Well, 
thank you very much, Mrs. — ” 
but by the time he got it all 
stammered out, I had the door 
closed. 

I went to the settee, rubbing 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




my hands. “Bring the bottle, 
Henry.” 

He brought it, and sat down 
by me, and we ate. It was very 
good, which is the least a man 
can expect. I toyed with the idea 
of yelling for some tabasco, but 
I’d had enough fun with Loretta 
for the time being. Enveloping 
that food, my stomach felt well 
pleased with itself. Silent, un- 
smiling and intent, Henry ab- 
sorbed what was on his plate. 

1 poured a slug for Henry, 
knowing I could afford to be 
generous, and one for myself. I 
leaned back and enjoyed a belch, 
which made Henry jump, threw 
down the bourbon, poured an- 
other and went to the desk. 

On my desk is a typewriter, 
and under the typewriter is a 
sound-absorbing mat, and in the 
mat I keep a sewing-machine 
needle, the best toothpick Man 
ever made. It’s strong and it’s 
sharp and it has a base you can 
get a grip on without snapping it. 
I sat in the swivel chair and 
leaned my elbows on the type- 
writer and picked my teeth and 
watched Henry mopping the 
honey off his dessert plate with 
a piece of bread. 

“That was — your wife certainly 
can — ” 

“Like I said, Henry, nothing 
but the best. Sit down over here. 
Bring your drink.” 



He hesitated, then brought it 
over and put it on the desk where 
I could reach it. He sat down 
on the edge of the easy chair. He 
looked like a worrisome kitten 
making its first try at sitting on a 
fence. I laughed in his face and 
he smiled right back at me. 

“What I’m going to do, Hen- 
ry,” I told him, I told average, 
stupid, fearful, dogface Henry, 
‘Tm going to let you in on some 
things that no human being on 
Earth knows. I’m going to tell 
you at the same time that these 
things are known to a number of 
people. Not a large number, but 
— a number. Could both those 
statements be true?” 

“Well, I—” he said. Then he 
blushed. 

“You’re sort of slow, so I’ll 
keep it simple and easy for you. 
I just got off a paradox. But it 
isn’t a paradox. Don’t sit there 
and smile and shake your head 
at me. Just listen. You’ll catch 
on. Now you and I — are we dif- 
ferent from each other?” 

“Oh, yes,” he breathed. 

“Right. At the same time, all 
human beings are alike. And you 
know what? No paradox there, 
either.” 

“No?” 

“No. And here’s why. You’re 
like my wife and the bartender 
and my city editor and all the 
billions of creepers and crawlers 
on Earth who call themselves 



WHEN YOU'RE SMILING 



97 




human beings. And as you just so 
perceptively pointed out, I’m not 
like you. And for your informa- 
tion, I’m not like Loretta or 
Steve or the city editor. Now do 
you see why there’s no paradox?” 
Henry shifted unhappily. He 
absolutely astonished me. How 
could a guy like that, without 
bluff, without deftness, without, 
as far as I could see, even the 
ability to lie a little — how could 
he live three consecutive days in 
a world like this? Look at him, 
worrying away at my question, 
wanting so much to get the right 
answer. 

It came like an abject apology: 
“No, I don’t see. No, I don’t.” 
His eyes flickered, the embar- 
rassed heat stirring and waning. 
“Unless what you mean is you’re 
not a human being.” He snickered 
weakly and again made that odd 
warding-off, half-ducking mo- 
tion. 

L eaning back, I beamed at 
him. “Now isn’t it a relief 
to know you’re not so dumb, 
after all?” 

“Is that really what you mean? 
You’re not . but I thought 
everybody was a human being!” 
he cried pathetically. 

“Don’t get all churned up,” I 
told him gently. 

I leaned forward very suddenly 
to startle him, and I did, too. I 
stuck my finger in my whiskey. 



lifted the glass with the other 
hand, and drew a wet circle on 
the desk-top, about eight inches 
in diameter. 

“Let’s say that anywhere in 
this circle — ” I moved the glass 
around inside the mark — “this 
glass is what you call human. 
When it’s here or here or a little 
bit forward, it’s still human; it’s 
just not the same human — the 
same Pind of human. You’re dif- 
ferent from Steve the bartender 
because everything he is is here, 
and everything you are is over on 
the other side, here. You’re dif- 
ferent because you’re placed 
differently in the circle, but you’re 
the same because you’re both in- 
side it. Presto — no paradox.” I 
moved the glass far enough to 
empty it and set it aside and put 
my hand in the circle. The wet 
wood was bleaching slowly, 
which was okay; Loretta would 
polish it up in the morning. 

“Inside this circle,” I said, “a 
man can be smart or stupid, 
musical, aggressive, tall, effemin- 
ate, mechanically apt, Yugoslav- 
ian, a mathematical genius or a 
strudel baker — but he’s still hum- 
an. Now by what Earthly con- 
ceit do we conclude that a man 
just has to live within that circle? 
What about a guy who’s bom 
here, on the outside edge? Why 
can’t he be here, right on the line? 
Who’s to say he can’t live way 
out here?” And I banged my 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




hand down a foot away from the 
circle. 

Henry said, “I — ” 

“Shut up. Answer: there are 
people outside this border. Not 
many, but some. And if you’re 
going to call the ones inside 
‘human,’ the ones outside have 
to be — something else.” 

“Is that what you are?” Henry 
whispered. 

“That’s me.” 

“Is that what they call a moot 
. mute . 

“Mutation? No! Well, damn 
it, yes; that’s as good a name as 
any. But not in any way you 
ever thought of. No atom-dust, 
no cosmic rays, nothing like that. 
Just normal everyday variation. 
Look, you have to go farther 
from one side of this circle to the 
other than from just inside to 
just outside — right? Yet the dis- 
tance across is within the permis- 
sable variation; the difference be- 
tween human beings which leaves 
them still human beings together. 
But one small variation this way 
— ” I slid my finger outside the 
circle — “and you have some- 
thing quite new.” 

“How — new?” 

T shrugged. “Any one of a zillion 
ways. Take any species. Take 
kittens from the same litter. 
You’ll find one has sharper claws, 
another has sharper eyes. Which 
is the best kitten?” 



“Well, I guess the one with 
the — ” 

“No, you mumbling Neander- 
thal.” That made him smile. 
“Neither one is best. They’re just 
different, each in a way that 
makes him hunt a bit better. Now 
say another of the litter has 
functional gills and another has 
mat-scales like an armadillo, 
there’s your . .” 

“Supercat?” he beamed. 

“Just call it ‘uncat.’ ” 

“You — you’re, uh, un — ” 
“Unhuman.” I nodded. 

“But you look — ” 

“Yeah, a cat with sweat-glands 
in its skin would look like a cat, 
too~-most of the time. I’m dif- 
ferent, Henry. I’ve always known 
I was different.” I poked my fin- 
ger toward him and he curled 
from its imaginary touch. “You, 
for example — you have, like no- 
body else I ever met, that stuff 
called ‘empathy.’ ” 

“I have?” 

“You’re always feeling with 
other people’s fingertips, seeing 
through other people’s eyes. 
Laugh with ’em, cry with ’em. 
Empathy.” 

“Oh. Yes, I guess — ” 

“Now me, I have as much of 
that as my armadillo-cat has fur. 
It’s just not in me. I have other 
things instead. Do you know I 
was never angrj' in my life? 
That’s why I have so much fun. 
That’s why I can push people

He wet his lips, clasped his 
hands together, blankly made the 
knuckles crack. Poor Henry! A 
brand-new idea and it was split- 
ting his skull-seams. 

“Couldn’t *you be,” he ven- 
tured at last, “just sort of — tal- 
ented, not really different at all?” 

“Ah! Now we come to the 
point. Now we get the big proof. 
Speaking of proof, where’s the 
bottle? Oh, here.” I poured. “See 
I’m a real modest boy, Henry. 
When I figured this all out, I 
didn’t do the human thing — con- 
clude that I was the only super — 
uh, unhuman in captivity. 
There’s just too many people be- 
ing born, too much variation this 



around. I can make anybody do 
anything, just because I always 
have myself under control. I can 
roar like a lion and beat my fists 
on the wall and put up a hell of 
a show, yet always know exactly 
what I’m doing. You knew me 
when, Henry. You’ve read my 
stuff. You’ve seen me operate. 
You going to call a man like me 
human?” 



100 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



way and that. Law of averages. 
There just has to be more like 
me.” 

“You mean just like — ” 

‘‘No! I mean more unhumans 
— all kinds, any kind. So, because 
I can think like an unhuman, I 
thought my way after others of 
my kind.” 

^T^RYING to heave up out of 
my chair, I quit and slumped 
back. ‘‘Damn it. You know. I’m 
hungry as a . Imagine, a din- 
ner like that. Why can’t she cook 
up something that sticks to a 
man’s ribs? I swear I’m as empty 
as a paper sack. Henry, check 
that door for me, see that it’s 
locked.” 

He went to the door and tried 
it. It was locked. As he came 
back, I picked up the brass key. 
‘‘This will open your eyes, Henry, 
old boy, old boy,” I said. 

I unlocked the file drawer. It 
got heavier all the time, I 
thought. Well, if you’re going to 
have fun, you’ve got to take care 
of the details. 

I lifted out the “Justice” file 
and banged it down beside the 
typewriter. “So I found me an- 
other unhuman. Takes one to 
catch one. Just you listen now 
and tell me what human being 
would even start this line of 
thinking, let alone carry it 
through.” I opened the file. 

“This all started,” I said, 



“when I did a piece on unsolved 
murders. You know that no city 
releases figures on unsolved mur- 
ders; well, not easily, anyway. 
You should see ’em — 69 per cent 
in one city, 73 in another. Some 
bring it down to 40 — our town 
got it to 38 per cent one year. But 
that’s a whole lot of scot-free 
murderers, hm? All over the 
country. Imagine! 

“So what I did — for the fea- 
ture story, you know — I dug up 
everything I could find on a 
whole drawerful of these cases. 
What I wanted was an angle. 
What’s the most obvious? Who- 
dunit, that’s what. So throw that 
out. What next? Who could have 
done it, but didn’t. Throw that 
out, too. 

“So then it occurred to me to 
see if there wasn’t some sort of 
lowest common denominator to 
them — here a second-string ad- 
vertising man with no enemies, 
there a teen-age hood with a 
knife in him, yonder a rich boy 
found floating next to his yacht 
— all kinds of people get mur- 
dered, you know. 

“Mind you, I’m still just look- 
ing for an angle. 

“Next, I threw out all the cases 
where people had a lot of ene- 
mies, and all the cases where a 
lot of people had an opportunity 
as well as a motive. This left a 
pretty strange stack. All of them 
were, apparently, reasonless, pur- 



WHEN YOU'RE SMILING 



101 




poseless murders, all done differ- 
ently at different places. 

“Well, I phoned and 1 legged 
and I sat and thought, and I 
interviewed God knows how 
many people. Couple of times, I 
came pretty close to finding new 
stuff, too, but who cares who- 
dunit? Not me. I wasn’t looking 
for crimes with a reason behind 
them. I was looking for killings 
with no motive. Any time the 
scent got hot, I threw that case 
out. By this time, I had a feature 
shaping up — I’d call it ‘Murder 
for What?’ Good for a couple 
spreads — maybe even a series.” 

T thumped the file. “I guess I 
had the answer for weeks be- 
fore I even knew it. Then, one 
night, I sat here and read every- 
thing through. And what do you 
know: in each and every one of 
these cases, someone was happy 
because of the murder! Or, any- 
way, happier. And I’m not talk- 
ing about people who inherited 
the victims’ loot, or poor perse- 
cuted wives and children who 
would no longer have to put up 
with the old man’s payday 
drunks. Reach me the bottle, 
Henry. 

“Now not a single one of this 
final stack showed motive or op- 
portunity for the — let’s say 
‘beneficiary’ of these murders. 
Like this one, where the old 
woman, her with a constitution 



like a buffalo, she’d been lying 
in bed for eight months pretend- 
ing to be sick so her daughter 
wouldn’t marry. The girl was 
nine miles away when someone 
cut the old biddy’s throat. 

“And this one here, an engin- 
eering student and a good one, 
working his own way through 
school and then had to quit and 
come home because his old man 
had doubled the size of the an- 
cestral hardware store for no 
reason but that it had been small 
enough to handle by himself. So 
one warm Sunday, the kid is, no 
fooling, in church in front of 
eighty witnesses while, down the 
road, somebody parts the old 
man’s head with a tire iron. They 
never did find out who. 

“And this one, this is practic- 
ally the best of all: a little old 
guy for years ran a flea circus, 
gluing costumes on ’em and mak- 
ing ’em turn little merry-go- 
rounds and all that kind of 
thing. Used to feed ’em off his 
arm. One fine day, someone 
swipes one of his pets and re- 
places it with pulex cheopis — a 
rat flea, to you — loaded to the 
eyeballs, or cephalothorax, as the 
case may be, with bubonic 
plague. First and only case of 
black plague in these parts in a 
hundred and eighty years.” I 
laughed. 

“Someone was happier?” Henry 
asked wonderingly. 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Well, the other fleas were. And 
besides, the old guy used to get 
a large charge out of cracking 
fleas in his tweezers right under 
the noses of the most squeamish 
women in the audience. You 
know how they go — blip!" 

TTENRY grinned. “Blip,” he 
half-whispered. 

“It’s hot in here,” I said un- 
comfortably. “Well, this is the 
part I was getting to, I mean 
about thinking unhumanly. I 
said to myself, now suppose, just 
for the sake of argument, that 
there’s this guy, see, a sort of 
mutant, a slight variation to just 
outside the circle, and he has 
this special way of thinking; he 
goes around killing people who 
stand in other people’s way. He 
never kills the same way or the 
same kind of person or in the 
same place. So how could any- 
one ever catch up with him? 

“Right away, I began looking 
into other deaths — the ‘natural 
causes’ ones. Why? Well, here, 
whoever he is, he might do some 
murders that look like murders, 
but he’d also do some that looked 
like natural causes; he’d have to; 
there’s only just so many ways 
you can kill people and this busy, 
busy boy would have to try all 
of ’em. So I smelled around look- 
ing not for a killer, but for happy 
people, innocent people, who had 
benefited from these deaths. 



“Whenever I found a situation 
like that, I checked back on the 
death. Sometimes it was a per- 
fectly genuine croak, but time 
and again I found what you 
might find if you knew what you 
were looking for . scarlet fever, 
for instance. People shouldn’t die 
of scarlet fever, but you know 
what? Feed somebody just 
enough belladonna and a doctor 
will write a scarlet fever certifi- 
cate for the late lamented, nice 
as you please, if he has no reason 
to be suspicious. And in these 
deaths — my busy boy’s work, I 
mean — there’s never any reason 
to be suspicious. Where’s the — 
you pour it for once, Henry. 

“Hey, Henry! I’m getting 
tighter’n a ticklish tick with a 
alum stick, haha . 

“ ’Course, by this time, the 
feature story was up the spout; 
I had better use for the situa- 
tion than a lousy feature or even 
a series. Yep. For weeks now. 
I’ve been following the meat- 
wagons and morguing around. 
All I do, I write ’em up when 
they look funny to me. I keep it 
to myself; it’s all in the files here, 
every one of ’em. Oh, man, if the 
papers or the coroner or some- 
body got hold of those files, what 
a hassle! They’d dig up the mar- 
ble orchards around here like 
potato patches! They’d find more 
little old embolisms and post- 
syncopes!

“Say, did you know that Aeon-

bane, which is aconite, has a root 
that grates up into a specially

up and died last Tuesday and 
they called it heart failure; her

me another. Do it m’self only 
I’m not myself if you see what 
I mmm. Good. 

“So where was I? Oh, yes, you 
say I’d nab this busy boy and 
get a reward. Well, there you go 
thinking like a human being. I, 
sir Henry, will do no such a thing. 
Now I don’t know exactly why 
this boy does this bit and I don’t 
much care, long’s I can get him to 
do it for me. He wants to knock 
off obstacles from the path of 
poor imprisoned souls, I got just 
the chore for him. Just some 
justice is all. 

“You see that scared rabbit 
came in here a while back with 
the tray, that Loretta? Now that 
thing with Loretta, it was great 
while it lasted, and it lasted too 
long about four months back. All 
the time around, oh, please don’t 
drink so much, where have you 
been, but I was worried . you 
know the routine, Henry. Now I 
could handle this myself, but 
even I can’t think of a way which 
wouldn’t be either expensive or 
messy. 

“When you come right down to 
it. I’d just as soon keep her 
around. 

“Loretta’s not much trouble. 
She leaves me alone pretty much 
and comes in here about the time 
I’m bottle dippy every night and 
gets me into bed, talking on bright 
and cheery as anything, just as if

I wasn’t hooked over the desk 
here, green as a gherkin and just 
as pickled . 

“The reason, the real reason 
I’d like to introduce this other 
unhuman type to my lovely wife 
is that I’d get more of a kick 
than you’d understand, just mak- 
ing him do it. Humans I can han- 
dle; this boy would be a real 
challenge. You can talk anybody 
into an3^hing, and yourself out 
of anything, if you can just think 
of the right thing to say — and I’m 
the boy who can do it. Was your 
mother frightened by a key- 
board?” 

“What?” he asked, startled. 

“That grin. What I’d like to 
know, I’d like to know how that 
busy boy covers so much terri- 
tory. First he has to find ’em, 
then he has to plan how to knock 
’em off, then he has to wait his 
chance ... so many, Henny! Five 
already this week and here it’s 
only Thursday!” 

“Maybe there’s more than 
one,” Henry suggested tenta- 
tively. 

S AY, I never thought of that!” 
I exclaimed. “I guess it’s be- 
cause there’s only one of me. 
Gosh, what a lovely idea — squads 
of unhumans thinking unhuman- 
ly, doing whatever they unhu- 
manly want all over the lot. 
But why should the likes of him 
or them take chances just to 



make some humans happy?” 

“They don’t care if anyone 
gets happy,” said Henry. “Why 
are you whispering?” 

“Must be getting pretty tight, 
I guess; can’t seem to do much 
better. Whee-ooo! Such a gorge- 
ous load! What? What’s that you 
said about the unhumans, that 
they don’t care about making 
people happy? Listen, son, don’t 
go telling me about unhumans. 
Who’s the expert around here? 
I tell you, every time they knock 
somebody off, someone around 
stops getting mistreated. Those 
files there — ” 

“Right files, wrong conclusion. 
You keep worrying about what 
you are; we don’t. We just are.” 

‘*We? Are you classifying your- 
self with me?” 

“I wasn’t,” said Henry, not 
smiling. “Just what you are, 
human or not, I don’t know and 
I don’t care. You’re a blowhard, 
though.” 

I snarled and heaved myself 
upward. But a whispered snarl 
doesn’t amount to much and you 
can heave all you like and get 
nowhere when your arms are 
deadwood and your legs are 
about as responsive as those old 
inner tubes in your neighbor’s 
back yard. 

“What’s the matter with me?” 
I rasped. 

“You’re about nine-tenths 
dead, that’s all.”

“Nine — what do you mean, 
Henry? What are you talking 
about? I’m just drunk, not — ” 
“Dicoumarin,” he said. “You 
know what that is?’’ 

“Sure I know what it is. Capil- 
lary poison. All the smallest 
blood vessels rupture and you 
bleed to death internally before 
you even know you’re sick. 
Henry, you’ve poisoned me.'” 
“Well, yes.” 

I tried to struggle up, but I 
couldn’t. “You weren’t supposed 
to kill me, Henry! It was Loretta! 
That’s why I brought you home 
— I guessed that the killer would 
be the opposite of the likes of 
me and you’re about as opposite 
as anybody could be. And you 
know I can’t stand her and kill- 
ing her would make me happier. 
It’s her you’re supposed to kill, 
Henry!” 

“No,” he answered stubbornly. 
“It couldn’t be her. I told you 
we don’t care if somebody’s made 
happier. It had to be you.” 
“Why? Why?'* 

“To stop the noise.” 

1 looked at him, frowned foggily, 
shook my head. 
“Self-defense,” he explained 
patiently. “I’m a — I suppose 
you’d call it a telepath, though it 
isn’t telepathy like you read 
about. No words, no pictures. 
Just a noise, I guess is the best 
word. There’s a certain kind of 



mind — human or not, who cares? 
— it can’t get angry, and it en- 
joys degrading other people and 
humiliating them, and when it’s 
enjoying these things, it sets up 
. that noise. We can’t stand 
the noise. You — you’re special. 
Hear you for miles. When we get 
rid of one of you, of course it 
makes a human happy — whoever 
it was you were humiliating.” 
Then he said again, “We can’t 
stand the noise.” 

I whispered, “Help me, Henry. 
Whatever it is, I’ll stop. I prom- 
ise I’ll stop.” 

“You can’t stop,” he said. “Not 
while you’re alive . Oh, damn 
you, damn you, you’re even en- 
joying dying!” He put forearms 
over his head — not over his ears 
— and rocked back and forth, and 
smiled and smiled. 

“You smile all the time,” I 
hissed. “Even now. You enjoy 
killing.’* 

“It isn’t a smile and I kill only 
to stop the noise.” He was breath- 
ing hard. “How can I explain to 
anything like you? The noise — 
it’s — some people can’t stand 
the screek of a hngernail on a 
blackboard, some hate the scrape 
of a shovel on a cement sidewalk, 
most can’t take the rasp of a file 
on metal.” 

“They don’t bother me a bit,” 
I said. 

“Here, damn you, look here!” 
He snatched my sewing-machine 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




needle and plunged it under his 
thumbnail. His lips spread wider. 
“It’s pain . pain! Only, with 
you, it’s agony! I can’t stand 
your noise! It puts all my teeth 
on edge, it hurts my head, it 
deafens me!’’ 

I remembered all the times he 
had smiled since I brought him 
home. And each time like the 
nail on the blackboard, like the 
shovel, like the rasp of the file, 
like the needle under the nail . 

I made a sort of laugh. “You’ll 
come with me. They’ll find the 
poison in me.” 

“Dicoumarin? You know bet- 
ter than that. And there won’t 
be any in the whiskey glass, if 
that’s what you’re thinking. I 
gave it to you three hours ago, 
in Molson’s, in the drink I didn’t 
want and you took.” 

“I’ll hang on and tell Lorrie.” 

“Tell me,” he jeered, leaning 
toward me, his smile that wasn’t 
a smile as huge as a boa’s about 
to bite. 

My tongue was thick, numb 
and wobbly. “Don’t!” I gasped. 
“Don’t . jump me . now, 
Henry.” 

A gain he clutched his head. 

“Get mad! If you could get 
mad, it would go away, that 
noise! Argh, you snakes, you 
freaks ... all of you who enjoy 
hating! The girl, remember her, 
in the bar? She was making that 



noise until I got her angry . 
she’s going to get better now that 
you’re dead.” 

I was going to say I wasn’t 
dead, I wasn’t yet, but my mouth 
wouldn’t work. 

“I’ll take these,” Henry said. 
I watched him stack the files 
right under my nose. “Every- 
thing’s nice and tidy,” he told 
me. “You were due to drink 
yourself to death, anyway, and 
here you are just like always. 
Only you won’t sleep this one 
off ... I wish I could have got 
you sore.” 

I watched him unlock the door, 
saw him go, heard him talking to 
Lorrie briefly. Then the outer 
door banged. 

L oretta came into the room 
and stopped. She sighed. “Oh, 
dear, we’re in a special mess to- 
night, aren’t we?” she said 
brightly. 

I tried, how I tried to yell, to 
scream at her, but I couldn’t, 
and it was growing dark. 

Loretta bent and pulled my 
arm around her neck. “You’ll 
have to help just a little now. 
t/psy-daisy!” Strong shoulders 
and a practiced hip hauled me 
upright, lolling.' “You know, I 
do like your friend Henry. The 
way he smiled when he left — 
why, it made me feel that every- 
thing’s going to be all right.”

From a feature writer to feature 
attraction— now there's a real 
booze-to-riches success storyl 



1 NEVER thought I’d like 
circus life, but a year of it 
has changed me. It’s in my 
blood now and I suppose I’ll never 
give it up— even if they’d let me. 

This job is better than anything 
1 could get in the newspaper 
racket. I work all summer, it’s 
true, but I get the winter off, 
though some of the offers for 
winter work are mighty tempting. 
Maybe if I hadn’t been kicked 
off the paper, I’d be city editor 
now, knocking my brains out. 
Who knows? But maybe I’d just 
be a rewrite man, or in the slot, 
writing heads, or copyreading. 
But the thought of newspaper 



illustroled by KOSSIN 



work after all this appalls me. 

Trlk, the Sybillian, should be 
thanked for the whole thing, I 
suppose, though it would be a 
grudging thank-you I’d give him, 
considering all the trouble he 
caused. Still . 

I first saw him on a July morn- 
ing at the beginning of the vaca- 
tion schedule, when four of us on 
the local side were trying to 
do five people’s work. 

My first inkling anything was 
wrong came when I returned from 
the courthouse beat and stuck a 
sheet of paper in the typewriter 
to write the probate court notes. 

I struck the keys. They wouldn’t

go all the way down. I opened 
the cover plate, looked in to see 
what was wrong. I saw nothing, 
so I tried again. Oscar Phipps, 
the city editor, was giving me the 
eye. I figured maybe he was pull- 
ing a trick on me. But then I 
knew he hadn’t. He wasn’t the 
type. 

back space, tabular, mar- 
gin release, shift and shift lock 
worked perfectly. But the keys 
only went down a short way be- 
fore they stopped. All except one 
key. The cap D. 

I hit the D. It worked fine the 
first time, biit not the second. I 
tried all the keys again. This time 
only the i worked. Now I had Di. 
I went ahead testing. Pretty soon 
I had 
Dimly 

Then came a space. A few letters 
more and it was 

Dimly drouse the dreary droves 
Phipps had one eyebrow raised. 
I lifted the cover plate again. 
Quickly. 

There I saw a fu 2 zy thing. It 
whisked out of sight. I snapped 
the plate down and held it down. 
The party I had been on the 
night before hadn’t been that 
good and I had had at least three 
hours’ sleep. 

I tried typing again. I got 
nothing until I started a new 
line. Then out came 

Primly prides the privy prose 



1 banged up the plate, saw a 
blur of something slinking down 
between the type bar levers again. 
Whatever it was, it managed to 
squeeze itself out of sight in a 
most amazing way. 

“Hey!” I said. “I know you’re 
down there. What’s the big idea?” 
Fuzzy squeezed his head up 
from the levers. The head looked 
like that of a mouse, but it had 
teeth like a chipmunk and bright 
little black beads for eyes. They 
looked right at me. 

“You go right ahead,” he said 
in a shrill voice. “This is going 
to be a great poem. Did you get 
all that alliteration there in those 
two lines?” 

“Listen, will you get out of 
there? I’ve got work to do!” 
“Yes, I think I’ve hit it at last. 
It was that four-stress iambic that 
did it. It was iambic, wasn’t it?” 
“Go away,” I said miserably. 
Fuzzy pulled the rest of himself 
out of the bars and stood on 
hind feet. He crossed his fore- 
paws in front of him. vibrated 
his long, furry tail, and said de- 
fiantly, “No.” 

“Look,” I pleaded, “I’m not 
Don Marquis and you’re not 
Archie and I have work to do. 
Now will you please get out of 
this typewriter?” 

His tiny ears swiveled upward. 
“Who’s Don Marquis? And 
Archie?” 

“Go to hell,” I said. I slammed 



BRKNK'S BOUNTY

the cover down and looked up 
into the cold eyes of Oscar 
Phipps who was standing next to 
my desk. 

“Who, may I ask,” he said 
ominously, “do you think you’re 
talking to?” 

“Take a look.” I lifted the plate 
once again. Fuzzy was there on 
his back, his legs crossed, his 
tail twitching. 

“I don’t see anything,” Phipps 
said. 

“You mean you can’t see 
Fuzzy here?” I pointed to him, 
the end of my finger an inch from 
his head.“Ouch!”I drew my hand 
away. “The little devil bit me.” 

“You’re fired, Mr. Weaver,” 
Phipps said in a tired voice. 
“Fired as of right now. I’ll ar- 
range for two weeks’ severance 
pay. And my advice to you is to 
stay off the bottle or see a psy- 
chiatrist — or both. Not that it’ll 
do you any good. You never 
amounted to anything and you 
never will.” 

I would have taken a swipe at 
Fuzzy, but he had slunk out of 
sight. 

INURING the two erratic years 
I had been on the newspaper, 
I had passed the city park every 
morning on my way to work, 
feeling an envy for those who had 
nothing better to do than sit on 
the benches and contemplate the 
nature of the Universe. Now I 



took myself there and sat as I had 
seen others do, hoping to feel a 
kinship with these unfortunates. 

But all I did was feel alone, 
frustrated and angry at Phipps. 
Maybe I had been too convivial, 
maybe I had enjoyed night life 
too much, maybe I hadn’t given 
the paper my all. But I wasn’t 
ready for the booby hatch even if 
I had seen a fuzzy little thing that 
could talk. 

I drew a copy of Editor and 
Publisher from my pocket and 
was scanning the “Help Wanted: 
Editorial” columns when out of 
the corner of my eye I saw a blob 
of black moving along the walk. 

Turning handsprings, balancing 
himself precariously on the end of 
his vibrating tail, running and 
waving his forepaws to get my at- 
tention was Fuzzy. 

I groaned. “Please go away!” 
I covered my eyes so I wouldn’t 
have to look at him. 

“Why?” he piped. 

“Because you’re a hallucina- 
tion.” 

“I’m not a hallucination,” he 
said indignantly. “I’m real flesh 
and blood. See?” He vibrated his 
tail so fast, I could hardly see it. 
Then it stopped and stood straight 
out. “Lovely, isn’t it?” 

“Look,” I said, leaning far off 
the bench to speak to him, “I 
can prove you’re a hallucination.” 

“You can?” he quavered. 
“How?” 



110 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Because Phipps couldn’t see 
you.” 

“That square? Hahl He would 
not have believed it if he had 
seen me.” 

“You mean you — ” 

He disappeared and reappeared 
like a flashing neon sign. 
“There!” he said triumphantly. 

“Why didn’t you let him see 
you then?” I asked, a lirtle angry, 
but pleased nonetheless with his 
opinion of Phipps. “Because you 
didn’t, you cost me my job.” 

H e waved a forepaw deprecat- 
ingly. “You didn’t want to 
stay on that hick sheet anyway.” 
“It was a job.” 

“Now you’ve got a better one.” 
“Who's kidding whom?” 
“Together we’ll write real lit- 
erature.” 

“I don’t know anything about 
literature. My job is writing the 
news.” 

“You’ll be famous. With my 
help, of course.” 

“Not with that ‘dimly drouse’ 
stuff.” 

“Oh, that!” 

“Where did you come from, 
Fuzzy?” 

“Do I ask you where you come 
from?” 

“Well, no—” 

“And my name’s not Fuzzy. 
It’s Trlk, pronounced Turlick and 
spelled T-r-l-k.” 

“My name's Larry Weaver, 



pronounced Lar-ree — ” 

“I know. Look, you got a type- 
writer?” 

“A portable. At the apartment.” 

“That will do.” 

“Aren’t you taking things for 
granted? I haven’t said yet 
whether I liked the idea.” 

“Do you have any choice?” 

1 looked at him. a couple of 
ounces of harmless-looking fur 
that had already cost me my im- 
mediate future in the newspaper 
business. 

“I guess not,” I said, hoping I 
could find a way to get rid of 
him if things didn’t work out 
right. 

And so began a strange col- 
laboration, with Trlk perched on 
my shoulder dictating stories into 
my ear while I typed them. He 
had definite ideas about writing 
and I let him have his way. After 
all, I didn’t know anything about 
literature. 

Sometimes, when he’d get 
stuck, he’d get down and pace 
the living room rug. Other times 
he’d massage his tail, which was 
as long as he, smoothing it with 
his tongue and meticulously ar- 
ranging every hair on it. 

“It’s lovely, don’t you think?” 
he often asked. 

And I’d say, “If you spent as 
much time working on this story 
as you do admiring your tail, 
we’d get something done.” 

“Sorry,” he’d say, hopping on 



BRKNK'S BOUNTY

my shoulder again. “Where were 
we?” 

I’d read the last page and we’d 
be off again. 

/^NE day, Trlk crawled on a 
shelf to watch me shave, 
whiffed the shaving lotion bottle, 
became excited and demanded I 
put a drop of it in front of him. 
He lapped it up, sank blissfully 
back on his tail and sighed. 

“Wonnerful,” he squeaked. 
“Shimply wonnerful.” He hic- 
cupped. 

I let him sleep it off, but was 
always careful with the lotion 
after that. 

Days stretched into weeks, my 
money was running low and the 
apartment superintendent was 
pressing me for payment of the 
month’s rent. I kept telling him 
I’d pay as soon as the first checks 
came in. 

But only rejection slips came. 
First one, then two, then half a 
dozen. 

“They don’t even read them!” 
Trlk wailed. 

“Of course they read them,” I 
said. I showed him the sheets. 
They were wrinkled from han- 
dling. 

“The post office did that,” he 
countered. 

I showed him coffee spots on 
one page, cigarette burns on an- 
other. 

“Well, maybe — ” he said, but I 



don’t think anything would have 
convinced him. 

When the last story came back, 
Trlk was so depressed, I felt sor- 
rier for him than I did for myself. 

It was time. We had been work- 
ing hard. I got out a bottle. 

I poured a little lotion for Trlk. 

The next afternoon, we tackled 
the problem in earnest. We went, 
to the library, got a book on 
writing and took it home. After 
reading it from cover to cover, I 
said, “Trlk, I think I’ve found the 
trouble with your stories.” 

“What is it?” 

“You don’t write about things 
you know, things that happened 
to you, that you have observed.” 
I showed him where it advised 
this in the book. 

His eyes brightened. We went 
right to work. 

This time the stories glowed, 
but so did my cheeks. The nar- 
ratives all involved a man who 
lived in a hotel room. They re- 
counted the seemingly endless 
love affairs with his female visi- 
tors. 

“Why, Trlk!” I exclaimed. 
“How come you know about 
things like this?” 

TTE confessed he had lived 
with such a man, a free- 
lance writer who never made the 
grade with his writing, but who 
had plenty of girl friends who 
paid the freight. 



BRKNK'S BOUNTY

“He had a way with women,” 
Trlk explained. 

“He certainly had,” I said, 
reading again the last page he 
had dictated. 

“He finally married an older 
woman with money. Then he 
gave up trying to write.” 

“I don’t blame him,” I said 
wistfully. 

“I had to find another writer. 
This time I decided to try a 
newspaper. That’s where I ran 
into you.” 

“Don’t remind me.” 

Things got better after that. 
We began to get a few checks 
from magazines. They were 
small checks, but they paid a 
few bills. 

The big blow fell, however, 
when Mr. Aldenrood, the super- 
intendent, came roaring upstairs 
one day clutching a sheaf of 
papers. 

“This stuff!” he screamed, 
waving the sheets before me. 
‘ The kids found it in the waste 
paper. They’re selling them a 
dime a sheet around the neigh- 
borhood.” 

“They’re worth more than 
that,” I said, regretting that Trlk 
and I hadn’t burned our rough 
drafts. 

“You’re going to move,” Mr. 
Aldenrood said, “at the earliest 
possible instant.” His face was 
apoplectic. “I’m giving you no- 
tice right now — thirty days!” He 



turned and went out, muttering, 
“The idea of anybody commit- 
ting to paper — ” and slammed 
the door. 

Two days later, I was seated 
at the typewriter, smoking a 
cigarette and waiting for Trlk 
as he paced back and forth on 
the rug, tiny paws clasped be- 
hind his back, talking to him- 
self and working out a story 
angle at the same time, when 
suddenly there appeared on the 
carpet next to him a whole host 
of creatures just like him. 

I nearly gulped down my 
cigarette. 

Trlk let out a high-pitched 
screech of joy and ran over to 
them. They wound their long 
tails around each other, clasped 
and unclasped them, twined 
them together. It seemed a sort 
of greeting. Meanwhile, they 
kept up a jabber that sounded 
like a 33^ rpm record being 
played 78 rpm. 

Finally, the biggest one de- 
tached himself from the group 
and gave Trlk a tongue-lashing 
that would have done justice to 
a Phipps. Trlk hung his head. 
Every time he tried to say some- 
thing, the big one would start in 
again. 

A t length the leader turned 
to me. “My name is Brknk, 
pronounced burk-neck and 
spelled b-r-k-n-k.”

“And I’m Larry Weaver,” I 
said, hoping they weren’t rela- 
tives who were going to stay. 
“That’s pronounced Lar-ree — ” 

“I know. We’re from Sybilla 
III. Tourists. We include Earth 
in our itinerary. It has some of 
the quaintest customs of all the 
inhabited planets we visit. We’re 
terribly sorry for all the incon- 
veniences our wayward Trik here 
has caused you.” 

“It was nothing,” I said with 
a lightness I didn’t feel. 

“Trlk had threatened to run 
off many times. He has a craze 
for self-expression and your lit- 
erature fascinates him. He has 
an insatiable thirst — ” 

“I know.” 

H e turned to Trlk. “It’s against 
the rules of the Galactic 
Tours to make yourself visible 
to any of the inhabitants along 
the way. You know that. And it’s 
a prime offense to interfere with 
their lives. Do you realize how 
many rules you have broken, 
how long we have been looking 
for you?” 

“He did the best he could,” I 
said hopefully. “As a matter of 
fact, we were having considerable 
success with his — a literary pro- 
ject.” 

“I understand you lost your 
job because of him. Is that 
right?” 

“Yes, but I encouraged him.” 



I hoped there was some way I 
could ease the sentence. 

“Trlk has committed grievous 
wrongs, Mr. Weaver. We must 
make it up to you.” 

“Oh?” Here was an angle I 
hadn’t expected. 

“What can we do for you?” 

I considered a moment. “You 
mean a wish or something?” 
Brknk laughed. “Nothing like 
that. We’re not magicians.” 
“Well, I could stand a little 
cash.” 

“I’m sorry,” he said, and did 
look pained. “We can’t interfere 
in business. We don’t have any 
of your currency and we are for- 
bidden to duplicate or steal it.” 
He frowned and studied me. 
Suddenly his face brightened. 
He bawled orders and several 
smaller Sybillians rushed for- 
ward and started scampering all 
over me. One of them nipped a 
piece of flesh out of my arm. 

“Ouch!” I yelped, rubbing the 
spot. “What are you doing?” 
“You humans are a proud 
race,” Brknk explained. “I’ll give 
you reason to be prouder than 
the rest. We’ll change your me- 
tabolism, your endocrine balance, 
toughen your muscle fibers a 
thousandfold. We’ll make you the 
strongest man on Earth!” 

“Look,” I said, “I don’t want 
to be the strongest man on Earth.” 
“Well, how about the world’s 
champion boxer? We can speed

up your reflexes at least ten 
times.” 

I shook my head. “I don’t want 
that, either. Sounds too much 
like work. Besides, I never liked 
getting into fights.” 

¥>RKNK scowled, called a hud- 
die. They buzzed at each oth- 
er, their tails vibrating like mad. 
One of them finally yipped and 
everybody spun around. 

Brknk beamed. “We’ve got it!” 

“What is it?” 

A little Sybillian I hadn’t notic- 
ed jabbed something in my arm. 
I winced and he nearly fell off. 
He retreated with injured pride. 

“Come along, Trlk,” Brknk 
said. 

“What’s supposed to happen?” 
I asked. 

“It will be a glorious surprise,” 
Brknk assured me. “You’ll never 
regret it. The only thing I ask 
is that you never tell anyone 
about us.” 

I promised. 

Trlk looked up at me. I no- 
ticed the beginning of tears in 
his eyes. I reached down and 
patted him gently on the head. 

“So long, little fellow,’’ I said. 
“It’s been fun.” 

“Good-by,” he said sorrow- 
fully. 

They vanished. 

Nothing happened for several 
days, so I bought a copy of Ed- 



itor and Publisher and was writ- 
ing for my first job when I felt 
a tender spot on my tail bone. 
When I examined it, I saw a pro- 
tuberance there. 

There was no denying it. The 
Sybillians had given me what 
they treasured most. 

I was growing a tail — a long, 
hairy tail. 

As I say, I have come to like 
circus life. 

At first I tried to get doctors 
to cut it off. but they were too 
curious for that. Then I thought 
of jumping in the river or put- 
ting a bullet through my head. 

But after I saw what the sci- 
entists were making of it, when 
I viewed my picture in all the 
papers, and when I saw the awe 
with which I was regarded by 
everyone, I changed my mind. 

Now I make a cool twenty- 
five thousand a year without 
lifting a finger. 

Just my tail. 

I’ve become rather fond of it. 
I’ve even learned how to vibrate 
it. 

But I’ve never told anyone 
about the Sybillians. They 
wouldn’t believe it. 

Not old Phipps, anyway. 

Some day I’ll go and vibrate 
my tail right in his face. I’d nev- 
er amount to anything, eh? Let’s 
see him grow a tail!

STORIES FOR TOMORROW, 
edited by William Sloane. Funk 
and Wa^nalh Co., $3.95 

^T^HIS is the fattest anthology 
in years — 636 pages — and a 
very useful one for people new 
to science fiction. Addicts may 
object to the fact that 15 out of 
the 29 tales have been included 
in other books, but they are all 
superb items. Of the 14 unan- 
thologized stories, 6 at least are 
disappointing; but on the whole 
it is a rich and varied job, edited 
with real individuality. 



There are two stories each by 
Bradbury, Clarke. Jones, Blish, 
Neville and Simak, and none by 
Sturgeon, Kuttner, Leiber, van 
Vogt, and several others of the 
Famed: an indication of the very 
personal nature of the editor’s ap- 
proach to science fiction, which 
does make the book something 
less than a representative cross- 
section of the field. 

Sloane’s introduction and story 
notes are excellent, and his ideas 
about science fiction in general 
are worth attention. 

Nice job.

THE FORGOTTEN PLANET 
by Murray Leinster. Gnome 
Press, $2.50 

¥T'S a pleasure to have these 
three novelets (two very old 
and one recent) brought out in 
an attractive hardbound format. 
The book, too, is a genuine novel, 
not just three tales loosely 
jointed together. It is based on 
Leinster’s 1926 and 1927 Amazing 
Stories adventures, “The Mad 
Planet” and “Red Dust,” and on 
“Nightmare planet,” from Sci- 
ence Fiction Plus in 1953. 

The three have been effectively 
rewritten into a narrative of the 
struggles of a few humans who 
have reverted to savagery on a 
planet where monster insects and 
poisonous fungi are the predomi- 
nant forms of life. It tells how a 
primitive genius among the sav- 
ages finally brings his people 
back to the status of civilized be- 
ings. 

One may object to the un- 
necessarily pat coincidence that 
winds up the story, since it is in 
no way essential to the plot, but, 
outside of that, there is almost 
nothing in the story that is not 
first irate. 

It is Leinster at his exciting, 
skilled best. 

IDEAS AND OPINIONS by Al- 
bert Einstein. Crown Publishers, 
Inc., $4.00 



TTOW easy it is for the layman 
to forget what a supernal 
scientific genius the world has 
in Albert Einstein! He is an old 
man; his greatest discoveries 
were made half a century ago; 
his current work is so abstruse 
that it is beyond most of us; and 
his unflinching defense of freedom 
of inquiry sometimes overshad- 
ow his work as a mathematical 
physicist. 

Nevertheless, he is still, first 
and foremost, the greatest sci- 
entist of our time; and this book 
proves it. Over 150 of its 375 
pages are given over to his own 
popularizations of his scientific 
discoveries and they are magnifi- 
cent pages. 

For any reader who tends to 
accept Einstein concepts as mat- 
ters of mere machinery in mod- 
ern science fiction, as unexplained 
techniques for moving a story 
forward, their “inventor’s” own 
descriptions of their possibilities 
(and limitations) are essential 
reading. 

The other 225 pages in the book 
are equally fascinating, with their 
wealth of ideas about our modern 
society and its problems, and 
their unself-conscious portrait of 
a man who detests bigotry of 
every sort, social and political as 
well as scientific. 

Even for those who have the 
author’s two previous collections 
of essays in English, the present 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




book is valuable, for it includes 
many pieces he has written since 
1950, as well as a rich selection 
from the first two volumes. 

THE EXPLORERS by C. M. 
Kornbluth. Ballantine Books, 35c 

¥F you are like me in my ad- 
^ miration for Cyril Kornbluth. 
the news that this collection of 9 
of his tales contains one A-plus 
item never before published any- 
where will make you go out and 
buy it at once. 

“Gomez” is the story of a “nat- 
ural” scientist, a Latin who is 
first seen as a dishwasher in the 
Porto Bello Lunchroom, in New 
York City. He is Kornbluth’s fic- 
tional parallel to Srinivasa Ra- 
manujan, a very real instinctive 
mathematician who died in 1920. 
The story has everything, in- 
cluding a strong plea for freedom 
of science. 

Most of the other 8 stories are 
nearly as good. Four have ap- 
peared in general anthologies, 
the rest in magazines. Among the 
latter, “The Rocket of 1955” and 
“The Goodly Creatures” are par- 
ticularly outstanding. Indeed, 
Kornbluth’s first short story col- 
lection is a distinguished one 
throughout. 

/ AM LEGEND by Richard 
Matheson. Gold Medal Books, 
25c 



t'OR what I think is Gold 
■■■ Medal’s first venture into the 
field of original science fantasies, 
it has chosen a weird and, I fear, 
rather slow-moving first novel by 
a man heretofore known for his 
excellent short horror tales. 

I Am Legend tells of- a disease 
that almost completely wipes out 
the human race, leaving behind 
only a handful of hideously 
changed creatures to attempt to 
revive civilization. 

It is “supernatural” science 
fiction, a horrid, violent, ^Some- 
times exciting but too often over- 
done tour de force. 

STAR SCIENCE FICTION 
SHORT NOVELS, edited by 
Frederik Pohl. Ballantine Books, 
$2.00 hardbound, 35c paper 

W HAT an odd and wildly off- 
trail little book this is! It 
is definitely not for the prosaic- 
minded, the gadget-lover, the be- 
liever in sober scientific extra- 
polation. Its three novelets are 
for the imaginative reader only. 

The book opens with a not- 
too-successful tale, “Little Men,” 
by Jessamyn West, a novelist not 
heretofore known for science fan- 
tasy. It suffers because Miss West 
does not understand that in sci- 
ence fiction some explanation or 
rationale is necessary, and be- 
cause it is really only a sketch 
rather than a finished work.

Nevertheless, it is a fine anti- 
war tale, ironically told in angry 
retrospect by an Army captain 
whose whole career had vanished 
when the unexplained catas- 
trophe took place — most adults 
suddenly became the size of small 
children while most children be- 
came the size of adults. 

Naturally, the children took 
over; unnaturally, they carry out 
(in a thoroughly unchildlike 
way) the development of a so- 
ciety based on the logic of their 
own premises: war is bad be- 
cause it hurts people ; sex is 
dandy because it is fun; etc. 

Though the idea of the tale is 
first rate, its development leaves 
you dissatisfied and wanting a 
more convincing and less frag- 
mentary handling. 

Novelet No. 2 is Lester del 
Rey’s theological shocker, “For 
I Am a Jealous People.” It deals 
with a race of brutally sadistic 
alien invaders; and what their 
God does to the human parson 
who is the hero of the tale is 
really drastic! He finally learns 
that self-reliance is the clue to 
the salvation of the human race, 
not reliance on a God Who has 
rejected it. The tale is a philo- 
sophical melodrama, if I ever 
saw one! 

Best of the three, both as to 
writing and as to believability, is 
Theodore Sturgeon’s nightmare 
‘‘To Here and the Easel.” This 



is Sturgeon at his flaming best. 

In simple essence, he tells, in 
the first person, the hideous ex- 
periences of a schizoid, a split 
personality in whom the “real” 
character is a young painter, 
Giles, who has had to stop paint- 
ing because of his condition; and 
the “dream” person is a medieval 
knight, Rogero, who is involved 
with battlemented castles, hip- 
pogriffs, a heroine named Brada- 
mante and a foul magician called 
Atlantes. (Those who are well 
up on their early 16th Century 
Italian literature may peg those 
names in advance of Sturgeon’s 
final disclosure. I failed miser- 
ably to do so.) 

Question; is this madman’s 
fable overwritten? I don’t think 
so, for the blazing prose is satu- 
rated with an even more blazing 
drive or sort of demonic posses- 
sion. The story is, basically, an 
unforgettable self-portrait of a 
man on the verge of insanity, who 
is rescued by a homely young 
girl who had faith in him. And it 
is superb stuff. 

ONE IN THREE HUNDRED 
by J. T. McIntosh. Doubleday 
and Co., $2.95 

^THOSE who follow our illus- 

trious competitor. Fantasy and 
Science Fiction, will already have 
read this moving adventure in 
three separate novelets in its 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




pages. But for those who have 
not, let it be reported that the 
book relates the thrilling and 
tragic story of the exodus of a few 
thousand human beings from 
Earth at a time when the Sun is 
about to go nova. 

Part One tells of the difficult 
task of choosing those among 
Earth’s millions who are to 
escape; Part Two of the voyage 
to Mars, which will be their new 
home; and Part Three of the 
struggles of the colonists to es- 
tablish their lives on the new 
planet — a struggle more against 
the evils innate in imperfect Man 
than against the alien conditions 
of the new world. A distinguished 
tale. 

BRIEF NOTES ... The Oxford 
Book Company (no relation to 
the Oxford University Press) has 
put out a new item in its “Stu- 
dents Pocket Library” called 
Stories of Scienti6c Imagination 
(paper, 70c). It’s edited by Joseph 
Gallant and contains 7 already- 
anthologized stories (including 
two by Leinster-Jenkins!) and a 
16-page “digest” of A Connecti- 
cut Yankee in Kin^ Arthurs 
Court. An odd item, on all counts 



. Bantam Books has Line To 
Tomorrow (25c), a collection of 7 
wonderful tales by Lewis Pad- 
gett. All have appeared in hard 
covers before, 4 in Padgett’s A 
Gnome There H'as. One was 
originally published under the 
author’s real name, Henry Kutt- 
ner. This is pseudonymous hide- 
and-seek with a vengeance! . 
Also by “Padgett,” this time in 
collaboration with his wife, C. L. 
Moore, is Beyond Earth’s Gates, 
the original-novel-half of a new 
Ace Books double (35c), here 
coupled with Miss Andre Nor- 
ton’s Daybreak — 2250 A.D. 
(original title Starm.an’s Son). 
The Padgett-Moore item tells of 
still another parallel world, much 
like those which Murray Leinster, 
Fredric Brown, et al, have already 
described elsewhere — and, I am 
afraid, better. However, this is a 
readable enough tale of an evil 
theocratic world to which our 
Earth is “Paradise,” and of two 
young Earth people (one terribly 
dumb blonde and one “rising 
young actor”) who enter this 
other world and really tear up 
the pea-patch there. It’s an ac- 
ceptable time-passer.

HE most beautiful 
I farmland in the Galaxy 
m — ruined!” the Seerian 
moaned. He was seven feet tall 
and colored a deep blue. Large 
tears rolled out of the lubricating 
duct on his neck and stained his 
expensive shirt. For fifteen min- 
utes, he had been mumbling in- 
coherently about his ruined farm- 
land. 

“Calm yourself, sir.” Richard 
Gregor said, sitting erect and 
alert behind his ancient walnut 
desk. “The AAA Ace Interplane- 
tary Decontamination Service 
can solve your problem for you.’.’ 

“Could you tell us the nature 
of that problem, sir?” Arnold 
asked. 

The Seerian was still choked 
with emotion. He dried his lu- 
brication duct with a large hand- 
kerchief and stared earnestly at 
the two partners. 

“Ruin!” he cried. “That’s what 
I’m facing! The most beautiful 
farmland — ” 

“We understand, sir,” Gregor 
said. “But what sort of ruin?” 

“I own a farm in Bitter Lug, 
on the planet Seer,” the Seerian 
said, quieting down with an ef- 
fort. “I’ve planted eight hundred 
mulgs of land with carter, mow 
and barney. It will sprout inside 
of a month and the slegs will eat 
it all. I’ll be ruined, destroyed, 
wiped out — ” 

“Slegs?” Arnold repeated. 



SQUIRREL CAGE 



125 




“Rats, you would call them, of 
the species Alphyx Drex.” The 
lubrication duct became moist at 
the thought and the Seerian 
hastily wiped it. “This year, there 
has been an infestation of s-legs. 
My land is overrun with them. 
I’ve tried everything, but they 
multiply faster than I can kill 
them. Gentlemen, I will be fairly 
wealthy if I can harvest this crop. 
I will pay well if you can get rid 
of these beasts.’’ 

“I’m sure we can accommodate 
you,’’ Gregor said. “Of course, 
there’ll have to be a preliminary 
investigation. We like to know 
what we’re getting into.” 

“That's what the other com- 
panies told me,” the Seerian an- 
swered bitterly. “There just isn’t 
time. I’ve invested everything in 
seed. It’ll sprout in a few weeks 
and the slegs will wipe me out. 
They must be destroyed before 
the crop comes through.” 

G REGOR’S long, bony face 
became unhappy. He was a 
conservative operator and he 
didn’t enjoy doing business this 
way. Because of Arnold’s cocki- 
ness, AAA Ace had a habit of 
sigfMng contracts with impossible 
conditions. Gregor resented it, 
but it was what came of run- 
ning a planetary decontamination 
service on a shoestring. So far, 
they had been lucky. They were 
even beginning to show a mild 



profit. He didn’t want to jeop- 
ardize that now and the gleam 
in his partner’s eye made him 
apprehensive. 

The Seerian seemed honest 
enough: but you could never tell. 
For all Gregor knew, these slegs 
were ten feet tall and armed with 
blasters. Stranger things had hap- 
pened to AAA Ace. 

“Have you had any trouble 
from slegs in the past?” Gregor 
asked. 

“Of course. But they were no 
more a problem than the flying 
hangs, or the skegels, or the rot- 
ting mulch disease. They were a 
normal farming hazard.” 

“Why should they increase 
now?” 

“How should I know?” the 
Seerian retorted impatiently. “Do 
you want the job or not?” 

“We certainly do,” Arnold said, 
“and we can start — ” 

“My partner and I must hold 
a conference first,” Gregor cut in, 
and pulled Arnold into the hall. 

Arnold was short, chubby and 
incurably enthusiastic. His de- 
gree was in chemistry, but his in- 
terests lay everywhere. He had an 
enormous amount of odd infor- 
mation, culled from the several 
dozen technical journals he sub- 
scribed to, at considerable ex- 
pense to AAA Ace. 

For the most part, his knowl- 
edge was of little practical value. 
Few people cared why the natives 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




of Deneb X were searching for an 
efficient method of racial suicide, 
or why nothing but winged life 
ever evolved on the Drei worlds. 

Still, if you wanted to know, 
Arnold could tell you. 

“I’d like to find out what we’re 
getting into,” Gregor said. “What 
is species Alphyx Drex?” 

“They’re rodents,” Arnold an- 
swered promptly, “a little smaller 
than Earth rats and more timid. 
They’re vegetarians, living on 
grains, grasses and soft woods. 
Nothing unusual about them.” 

“Hmm. Suppose we find ten 
million of them?” 

“Fine.” 

“Oh, stop it!” 

“I’m serious! If he wanted 
every one of fifty rats destroyed, 
I wouldn’t take the job. We could 
spend the rest of our lives hunt- 
ing down the last five or six. What 
the Seerian needs is to have the 
sleg population reduced to its 
usual pre-epidemic proportions. 
That we can do and our contract 
will so state.” 

Gregor nodded. His partner 
could — very occasionally — show 
good business sense. 

“But can we control them in 
time?” he asked. 

“Absolutely. There are several 
modern rodent-control methods. 
Morganizing is one good way and 
the Tournier System is another. 
We’ll be able to decimate the rat 
population in a matter of days.” 



“All right,” Gregor said. “And 
we’ll specify in the contract 
that we are dealing only with 
species Alphyx Drex. Then we’ll 
know where we stand.” 

“Right.” 

They returned to the office. A 
contract was drawn up at once, 
giving AAA Ace a month to rid 
the farm of the greater number 
of its slegs. There was a bonus 
for every day before deadline that 
the work was completed, and for- 
feitures for every day past. 

“I’m going on vacation until 
the whole thing is over,” the 
Seerian said. “Do you really 
think you can save my crops?” 
“Don’t worry about it,” Arnold 
assured him. “We have Morgan- 
izing equipment and we’re taking 
Tournier System apparatus, just 
in case. Both are very effective.” 
“I know,” the Seerian said. “I 
tried them. But perhaps I was 
doing something wrong. Good 
day and the very best of luck, 
gentlemen.” 

Gregor and Arnold stared at 
the door after the Seerian left. 

next day, they loaded 
-*■ their ship with a variety of 
manuals, poisons, traps and other 
equipment guaranteed to make 
life difficult for rodents, and 
blasted off for Seer. 

After four days of uneventful 
travel. Seer was a bright green 
beneath them. They descended 



SQUIRREL CAGE 



127 




and the coastline of Bitter Lug 
came into view. Finally they pin- 
pointed their coordinates and 
touched down. 

Barney Spirit, as the Seerian’s 
farm was called, was a pretty 
place, with its neatly plowed 
fields and grassy meadows. The 
ancient shade trees were black 
and stately against the evening 
sky and twilight made the little 
reservoir a deep and translucent 
blue. 

The signs of neglect and rodent 
infestation were everywhere. The 
great lawns were eaten bare in 
patches and the trees were droop- 
ing and unkempt. Within the 
farmhouse, the marks of sleg 
teeth were on furniture, walls, 
even the big supporting beams. 

“He’s got his troubles, all 
right,” Arnold said. 

“IVe’ve got his troubles,’.’ Gre- 
gor corrected. 

Their inspection of the farm- 
house was accompanied by a con- 
tinual squealing from slegs hiding 
just out of sight. As they ap- 
proached a room, frantic scurry- 
Lngs began; but somehow the 
slegs vanished into their holes be- 
fore the partners could see them. 

It was too late to begin work, 
so Arnold and Gregor set up a 
variety of traps, to find out which 
would be most effective. They set 
up their sleeping bags and turned 
in. 

Arnold could sleep through 



anything, but Gregor spent an 
extremely uncomfortable night. 
Battalions and regiments of slegs 
could be heard running across the 
floors, banging into tables, biting 
at the doors and careening off the 
walls. Just as he was dozing off, 
an adventurous trio of slegs 
scampered across his chest. He 
brushed them off, burrowed lower 
into his sleeping bag, and man- 
aged to catch a few hours of fitful 
sleep. 

In the morning, they inspected 
their traps and found every one 
of them empty. 

They spent the next few hours 
dragging the ponderous Morgan- 
izing equipment from the ship, 
assembling it and adjusting the 
trigger relays and lures. While 
Arnold was making the last fine 
adjustments, Gregor unloaded the 
Tournier System apparatus and 
ran the field wires around the 
farm house. They turned both on 
and sat back to await the 
slaughter. 

Midday came; Seer’s hot little 
sun hung directly overhead. The 
Morganizing equipment hummed 
and grumbled to itself. The Tour- 
nier wires flashed blue sparks. 

Nothing happened. 

The hours dragged by. Arnold 
read every available manual 
on rodent control. Gregor dug 
out a pack of tattered cards 
and morosely played solitaire. 
The equipment murmured and 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




buzzed, exactly as its manufac- 
turers guaranteed. Enough power 
was consumed to light a medium- 
sized village. 

Not a single rodent corpse was 
produced. 

By evening, it was apparent 
that slegs were not susceptible to 
Morganizing or Tournierizing. It 
was time for dinner and a con- 
ference. 

“TryHAT could make them so 
elusive?” Gregor puzzled, 
sitting worriedly on a kitchen 
chair with a can of self-heating 
hash. 

“A mutation,” Arnold stated. 

“Yeah, that could do it. Su- 
perior intelligence, adaptability 
. , .” Mechanically, Gregor ate 
his hash. All around the kitchen, 
he could hear the patter of count- 
less little sleg feet, slipping in 
and out of holes, staying just out 
of sight. 

Arnold opened an apple pie. 
“They must be a mutation, and 
a damned clever one. We’d bet- 
ter catch one quick and find out 
what we’re up against.” 

But catching one was no easier 
than killing a thousand. The 
slegs stayed out of sight, ignor- 
ing traps, lures, snares and doped 
bait. 

At midnight, Arnold said, “This 
is ridiculous.” 

Gregor nodded abstractedly. 
He was putting the finishing 



touches on a new trap. It was a 
large sheet metal box with two 
sides left invitingly open. If a 
sleg were foolish enough to enter, 
a photo-electric cell closed the 
sides with the speed of a light- 
ning bolt. 

“Now we’ll see,” Gregor said. 
They left the box in the kitchen 
and went into the living room. 

At two-thirty in the morning, 
the sides slammed shut. 

They hurried in. Within the 
metal box, they could hear a 
frantic scurrying and squealing. 
Gregor turned on the lights and 
up-ended the box. Although he 
knew that no rat born could climb 
the polished sides of the trap, he 
withdrew the cover with great 
care, an inch at a time. 

The squealing increased. 

They eagerly peered into the 
trap, half prepared to see a rat in 
full soldier’s uniform, waving a 
white flag. 

They saw nothing. The box was 
empty. 

“He couldn’t have gotten out!” 
Arnold exclaimed. 

“And he didn’t gnaw through. 
Listen!” 

Inside the box, the squealing 
continued, accompanied by fran- 
tic scratching sounds, as though 
a rat were trying to scramble up 
the sides of the trap. 

Gregor put his hand in and felt 
cautiously around. “Ouch!” He 
jerked his hand back. There were 



SQUIRREL CAGE

two small toothmarks on his 
forefinger. 

The noise within the empty box 
increased. 

“We seem to have captured an 
invisible rat,” Gregor said blank- 
ly- 

^ I 'HE Seerian was vacationing 
at the Majestic Hotel, in the 
Catakinny Cluster. It took al- 
most two hours to reach him by 
interstellar telephone. 

Gregor started the conversa- 
tion by shouting, “You never said 
anything about invisible slegs!” 

“Didn’t I?” the Seerian asked. 
“Careless of me. What about it?” 

“It’s a breach of contract, 
that’s what!” Gregor yelled. 

“Not at all. My lawyer, who 
happens to be vacationing with 
me, says that invisibility in ani- 
mals comes under the classifica- 
tion of Natural Protective Col- 
oration, and therefore need not 
be mentioned as a hazardous or 
unique condition. For legal pur- 
poses, the courts don’t even ad- 
mit a state of invisibility exists, 
as long as some means of de- 
tection is possible. They call it 
Relative Dimness and it is not 
allowed as permissible distress in 
an extermination contract.” 

Gregor was momentarily stun- 
ned. 

“We poor farmers must pro- 
tect ourselves, you know,” the 
Seerian continued. “But I have 



perfect faith in your ability to 
cope. Good day.” 

“He’s protected, all right,” 
Arnold admitted, putting down 
the extension telephone. “If we 
clean out these invisible rats, he’s 
got a bargain. If we don’t, he 
collects forfeitures.” 

“Invisible or not,” Gregor said, 
“Morganizing ought to work on 
them.” 

“But it doesn’t,” Arnold point- 
ed out. 

“I know. But why doesn’t it 
work? Why don’t traps work? 
Why doesn’t the Tournierizing 
work?” 

“Because the rats are invisible.” 
“That shouldn’t matter. They 
still sniff like rats, don’t they? 
They still hear like rats. They 
still think like — or do they?” 
“Well,” Arnold said, “if this in- 
visibility is a true mutational 
change, it’s possible that their 
sensory apparatus has changed, 
too.” 

Gregor frowned. “And a change 
in their sensory equipment would 
call for a change in our applied 
stimulus. Now all we need to 
know is how these slegs differ 
from the norm.” 

“Aside from their invisibility, 
you mean,” Arnold said. 

¥>UT how do you test the sen- 
^ sory apparatus of an invisible 
rat? Gregor began by construct- 
ing a maze out of the Seerian’s 



T30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




choicer furniture. Its walls were 
designed to light up when an in- 
visible sleg brushed by. In that 
way, the rodents’ movements 
could be traced. 

Arnold experimented with 
stains and dyes, searching for 
something that would return the 
slegs to visibility. One high- 
potency dye took momentary 
hold. A sleg appeared as though 
by magic, blinking slowly, his 
nose quivering. He looked at 
Arnold with maddening calm, 
then fearlessly turned his back. 
His rapid metabolic rate con- 
verted the dye almost immedi- 
ately and he faded from view. 

Gregor captured ten slegs and 
tried to run them through his 
maze. They were unbelievably 
uncooperative. Most of them re- 
fused to move at all. They sniffed 
disdainfully at the food he gave 
them, toyed with it a few mo- 
ments, then ignored it. Even light 
electric shocks budged them only 
a few inches. 

But the tests did give the an- 
swer to the failure of Morganiz- 
ing and Tournierizing. 

Like all large-scale extermina- 
tion systems, they were based 
upon the concept of “normal” 
rodents. These normals could be 
tricked or scared into certain be- 
havior patterns by stimulation of 
their hunger or fear drives. It 
was the norm among rodents that 
the systems destroyed. 



Everything was fine as long as 
the norm represented a high per- 
centage of the rodent population. 
But as the slegs had changed, 
their norm had changed, too. 
These slegs had adapted to in- 
visibility. 

They could no longer be pan- 
icked, for they had discovered 
that nothing chased them. And 
since they had no reason to flee, 
they could eat anywhere, at any 
time. Therefore, they were in- 
variably well fed and in no mood 
to explore enticing smells, shapes 
or sounds. 

Both Morganizing and Tour- 
nierizing could be adapted and 
would destroy slegs. But only a 
few. Only those rodents who had 
not adapted to invisibility — the 
unaverage ones. And this only 
served to reinforce the change in 
the others. 

But what had happened to the 
natural enemies of the sleg, the 
forces acting to maintain an eco- 
logical balance? In order to find 
out, Gregor and Arnold made a 
frantic survey of the fauna of 
Bitter Lug. 

Bit by bit, they reconstructed 
what must have happened. 

The slegs had enemies on Seer 
— flying hangs, drigs, tree skurls 
and omenesters. These unimagi- 
native creatures had been unable 
to cope with the sudden change. 
For one thing, they were visual 
hunters, using smell only as an 



SQUIRREL CAGE 



131 




auxiliary. Although sleg scent 
was powerful in their nostrils, 
seeing was believing, not smell- 
ing. So they ate each other and 
left the slegs alone. 

And the slegs increased and in- 
creased . 

And AAA Ace could find noth- 
ing to check them. 

W E’RE tackling this at the 
wrong end,” Gregor said, 
after a fruitless week. “We should 
find out why they became in- 
visible. Then we’d know how to 
deal with them.” 

“Mutation,” Arnold insisted 
dogmatically. 

“I don’t believe it. No animal 
has ever mutated into invisibility. 
Why should the slegs be the 
first?” 

Arnold shrugged his shoulders. 
“Consider the chameleon. There 
are insects that look like twigs. 
Other resemble leaves. Some fish 
can counterfeit the ocean bottom 
so perfectly — ” 

“Yes. yes,” Gregor said im- 
patiently, “that’s camouflage. But 
invisibility — ” 

“Some kinds of jellyfish are 
transparent enough to be con- 
sidered invisible,” Arnold contin- 
ued. “The hummingbird achieves 
it by dazzling speed. The shrew 
hides so well that few humans 
have ever seen one. All are mov- 
ing toward invisibility.” 

“That’s ridiculous. Nature 



equips each creature as best it 
can. But it never goes all the way 
by endowing one species with in- 
vulnerability from all others.” 

“You’re being teleological,” 
Arnold objected. “You’re assum- 
ing that nature has some aim in 
mind, like the overseer of a gar- 
den. I maintain that it’s a blind 
averaging process. Sure, the mean 
usually obtains, but there are 
bound to be extremes. Nature had 
to come up with invisibility 
eventually.” 

“Now you're being teleological. 
You’re trying to tell me that the 
aim of camouflage is invisibility.” 

“It must be! Consider — ” 

“To hell with it,” Gregor said 
wearily. “I’m not even sure what 
teleology is. We’ve been here 
ten days and we’ve captured some 
fifty rats, out of a population of 
several millions. Nothing works. 
Where do we go from here?” 

They sat in silence. Outside, 
they could hear the scream of a 
flying hang as it dipped low over 
the fields. 

“If only the slegs’ natural ene- 
mies had some guts,” Arnold said 
sadly. 

“They’re visual hunters. If they 
were — ” 

He stopped abruptly and stared 
at Arnold. Arnold looked puz- 
zled for a moment. Then a slow' 
light of comprehension dawned 
on his face. 

“Of course!” he said. 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Gregor lunged for the telephone 
and called Galactic Rapid Ex- 
press. "Hello! Listen, this is a 
rush order . 

G alactic Rapid Express 
outdid themselves. Within 
two days, they deposited ten 
small boxes on the pocked lawn 
at Barney Spirit. 

Gregor and Arnold brought the 
boxes inside and opened one. Out 
stepped a large, sleek, proud, 
yellow-eyed cat. She was of Earth 
stock, but her hunting capabili- 
ties had been improved with a 
Lyraxian strain. 

She stared somberly at the two 
men and sniffed the air. 

“Don’t get your hopes too 
high,” Gregor told Arnold as the 
cat stalked across the room. 
"This is outside all normal cat 
experience.” 

"Shh,” Arnold said. "Don’t dis- 
tract her.” 

The cat stood, her head cocked 
delicately to one side, listening 
to several hundred invisible slegs 
amble disdainfully past her. 

She wrinkled her nose and 
blinked several times. 

"She doesn’t like the setup,” 
Gregor whispered. 

"Who does?” Arnold whispered 
back. 

The cat took a cautious step 
forward. She raised a forepaw, 
then lowered it again. 

“She isn’t catching on,” Gregor 



said regretfully. “Maybe if we 
tried terriers — ” 

The cat suddenly lunged. There 
was a wild squealing and she was 
gripping something invisible be- 
tween her forepaws. She mewed 
angrily and bit. The squealing 
stopped. 

But other squeals took its place 
and ratlike shrieks and rodent 
cries of terror. Gregor released 
four more cats, keeping the re- 
maining five as his second team. 
Within minutes, the room sound- 
ed like a miniature abattoir. He 
and Arnold had to leave. The 
noise was nerve-shattering. 

“Time for a celebration,” 
Arnold said, opening one of the 
brandy bottles he had packed. 

"Well,” said Gregor, "it’s a lit- 
tle early — ” 

"Not at all. The cats are at 
work, all’s well with the world. 
By the way, remind me to order 
a few hundred more cats.” 

"Sure. But what if the slegs 
turn cautious again?” 

“That’s the beauty of it,” 
Arnold said, pouring two stiff 
shots. "As long as the slegs are 
this way, they’re meat for the 
cats. But if they revert to their 
old habits — if they become truly 
ratlike — ^we can use the Mor- 
ganizer.” 

Gregor could find no argument. 
The slegs were caught between 
the cats and the Morganizer. 
Either way, the place should be

back to normal in another week, 
in plenty of time for a sizable 
bonus. 

“A toast to the Earth cat,” 
Arnold proposed. 

“I’ll drink to that,” Gregor 
said. “To the staimch, down-to- 
Earth, common-sense Earth cat.” 
“Invisible rats can’t faze her.” 
“She eats ’em if they’re there or 
not,” Gregor said, listening to the 
sweet music of carnage going on 
throughout the farmhouse. 

T hey drank quite a number 
of toasts to the various at- 
tributes of the Earth cat. Then 
they drdnk a solemn toast to 
Earth. After that, it seemed only 
proper to toast all the Earth- 
type suns, starting with Abaco. 

Their brandy gave out when 
they reached Glostrea. Fortunate- 
ly, the Seerian had a cellar well 
stocked with local wines. 

Arnold passed out while pro- 
posing a toast to Wanlix. Gregor 



managed to last through Xechia. 
Then he laid his head on his arms 
and went to sleep. 

They awoke late the next day 
with matching headaches, upset 
stomachs and flashing pains in 
the joints. And just to make mat- 
ters worse, not one of their 
staunch, down-to-Earth, com- 
mon-sense Earth cats was to be 
found. 

They searched the farmhouse. 
They looked in the bams, through 
the meadows, across the fields. 
They dug up sleg holes and 
peered into an abandoned well. 

There was no sign of a cat — 
not even a wisp of fur. 

On all sides, the slegs scam- 
pered merrily by, secure in their 
cloak of invisibility. 

“Just when the cats were doing 
so well,” Arnold mourned. “Do 
you suppose the slegs ganged up 
on them?” 

“Not a chance,” Gregor said. 
“It would be contrary to all sleg

off. Gregor watched, thinking 
dire thoughts. 

Half of their month was now 
over, Gregor realized, and the 
sleg population was untouched. 
Cats could do the job; but if they 
gave up after a few hours, they 
would be too expensive to utilize. 
Would terriers do any better? 
Or would this happen to any — 

He gaped suddenly and nudged 
Arnold. “Hey!” Arnold awoke 
with a groan and looked. 

A moment ago, there had been 
an extremely busy cat. Now, 
abruptly, there was only a collar, 
suspended half a foot above the 
floor, its little bell tinkling mer- 
rily. 

“She’s become invisible!” Ar- 
nold crier. “But how? Why?” 

“It must be something she 
ate,” Gregor said wildly, watch- 
ing the collar dart across the 
floor, 

“All she’s eaten is sleg.” 

They looked at each other with 
sudden comprehension. 

“Then sleg invisibility is not 
mutational!” Gregor said. “I told 
you so all along. Not if it can be 
transmitted that way. The slegs 
must have eaten something, too!” 

Arnold nodded. “I suspected it. 
I suppose, after the cat digests a 
certain amount of sleg, the stuff 
takes hold. The cat becomes in- 
visible.” 

From the bedlam in the room, 
they could tell that the invisible 



cat was still devouring- invisible 
slegs. 

“They must all still be here,” 
Gregor said. “But why didn’t 
they answer when we called 
them?” 

“Cats are pretty independent,” 
Arnold suggested. 

The bell tinkled. The collar, 
miraculously suspended half a 
foot above the floor, continued to 
dart back and forth among the 
ranks of sleg. Gregar realized that 
it didn’t really matter if the cats 
couldn’t be seen, as long as they 
continued working. 

But while he watched, the 
tinkle of the bell stopped. The 
collar was motionless in the mid- 
dle of the floor for a moment; 
then it disappeared. 

Gregor continued staring at the 
spot where the collar had been. 
He was saying, very softly, “It 
didn’t happen. It just didn’t hap- 
pen,” 

Unfortunately, he knew it had. 
The cat hadn’t jumped, moved, 
advanced or retreated. 

The invisible cat had disap- 
peared. 

A lthough time was draw- 
ing short, they knew they 
would have to start at the begin- 
ning and find what was producing 
the invisibility, Arnold settled 
into his makeshift laboratory and 
began to test all substances 
around the farm. His eyes be- 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




came red-rimmed and haggard 
from long hours of peering into 
a microscope and he jumped at 
the slightest sound. 

Gregor continued to experiment 
with the cats. Before releasing 
number seven, he fitted a tiny 
radar reflector and radio signal 
emitter to her collar. She fol- 
lowed the identical pattern of cat 
number six — after several hours 
of hunting, she became invisible; 
shortly after that, she disap- 
peared. Radar showed no trace 
of her and the radio signal had 
stopped abruptly. 

He tried a more carefully con- 
trolled experiment. This time, he 
put cats eight and nine into 
separate cages and fed them 
weighed samples of sleg. They 
became invisible. He stopped 
feeding number eight, but con- 
tinued with nine. Cat number 
nine disappeared like all the oth- 
ers, leaving no trace. Eight was 
still invisible, but present. 

Gregor had a long argument 
with the Seerian over the inter- 
stellar telephone. The Seerian 
wanted AAA Ace to forfeit now, 
at only a small loss, and let one 
of the bigger companies move in. 
Gregor refused. 

But after the talk, he wondered 
if he had done the right thing. 
The secrets at Barney Spirit 
were deep and involved, and 
might take him a lifetime to 
solve. Invisibility was bad 



enough. But the vanishing was 
much worse. It left so little to 
go on. 

He was mulling this over when 
Arnold came in. His partner had 
a wild look in his eyes and his 
grin seemed almost demented. 

“Look,” he said to Gregor, 
holding out one hand, palm up. 

Gregor looked. Arnold’s hand 
was empty. 

“What is it?” Gregor asked. 

“Only the secret of invisibility, 
that’s all it is,” Arnold said with 
a cackle of triumph. 

“But I can’t see anything,” 
Gregor answered cautiously, won- 
dering how best to deal with a 
madman. 

“Of course you can’t. It’s in- 
visible.” He laughed again. 

Gregor moved back until he 
had put a table between them. 
Soothingly, he said, “Good work, 
old man. That hand of yours will 
go down in history. Now suppose 
you tell me all about it.” 

“Stop humoring me, you idiot,” 
Arnold snapped, still holding out 
his open hand. “It’s invisible, 
but it’s there. Feel it.” 

G regor reached out gingerly. 

In Arnold’s hand was what 
felt like a bunch of coarse leaves. 

“An invisible plant!” Gregor 
said. 

“Exactly. This is the culprit.” 
Arnold had examined every 
substance on the farm without 



SQUIRREL CAGE 



137 




results. One day, he had been 
walking in front of the house. He 
had looked again at the bald 
spots on the pocked lawn. For 
the first time, it struck him how 
regularly they were spaced. 

He bent down and examined 
one. It was bare, all right. The 
dirt showed through. 

He touched the spot — and 
found that he was touching an 
invisible plant. 

“As far as I can tell,” Arnold 
said, “there’s an invisible plant 
of no known species growing in 
each of those spots.” 

“But where did they come 
from?” 

“Somewhere Man has never 
been,” Arnold said positively. “I 
suppose that the progenitor of 
this species was floating in space, 
a microscopic spore. Finally it 
was drawn into the atmospheric 
orbit of Seer. It fell on the lawn 
at Barney Spirit, took root, blos- 
somed, threw out seeds — and 
there we are. We know that slegs 
eat grasses and their sense of 
smell is relatively well developed. 
They probably found this stuff 
very tasty.” 

“But it’s invisible!” 

“That wouldn’t bother a sleg. 
Invisibility is too sophisticated 
a concept for them.” 

“And you think all of them ate 
it?” 

“No, not all. But those who did 
stood the best chance for sur- 



vival. They were the ones the 
hangs and drigs didn’t pick off. 
And they transmitted the taste 
to the next generation.” 

“And then the cats came in, 
ate the slegs and got enough of 
the substance to turn invisible. 
Fine. But why did they com- 
pletely vanish?” 

“That’s obvious,” Arnold said. 
“The slegs ate this plant as just 
a part of their normal diet. But 
the cats ate only sleg. They got 
an overdose.” 

“Why should an overdose make 
anything vanish? Vanish to 
where?” 

“Maybe some day we’ll find 
out. Right now, we have a job to 
do. We’ll burn out all the plants. 
Once the slegs work the stuff out 
of their systems, they’ll become 
visible again. Then the cats can 
go to work.” 

“I just hope it does the job,” 
Gregor said dubiously. 

T^HEY went to work with port- 
* able flamethrowers. The in- 
visible plants were easy to spot, 
since they formed bare spots in 
the lush green lawns of Barney 
Spirit. In this instance, invisi- 
bility gave them an exceedingly 
low survival value. 

By evening, Gregor and Arnold 
had burned every one of the 
plants into ashes. 

The next morning, they ex- 
amined the lawn and were dis- 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




concerted to find a new pattern 
of pock marks. New plants were 
growing in them, as copiously as 
before. 

“No cause for alarm.” Arnold 
said. “The first bunch must have 
seeded just before we destroyed 
them. This crop will be the last.” 

They spent another day de- 
stroying the plants, scorching the 
entire lawn for good measure. At 
dusk, a new shipment of cats ar- 
rived from Galactic Rapid Ex- 
press. They kept them caged, 
waiting for the slegs to return to 
visibility. 

In the morning, more invisible 
plants were growing on the 
scorched soil at Barney Spirit. 
AAA Ace held an emergency con- 
ference. 

“It’s a ridiculous idea,” Gregor 
said. 

“But it’s the only way left,” 
Arnold insisted. 

Gregor shook his head stub- 
bornly. 

“What else can we do?” Arnold 
asked. “Do you have any ideas?” 
“No.” 

“We’re only a week from dead- 
line. We’ll probably lose part of 
our profits anyhow. But if we 
don’t complete the job, we’re out 
of business.” 

A rnold set a bowl of invisi- 
ble plants on the table. “We 
have to find out where the cats 
go when they get an overdose.” 



Gregor stood up and began to 
pace the floor. “They might show 
up inside a sun, for all we know.” 
“That’s a risk we have to take.” 
Arnold said sternly. 

“All right,” Gregor sighed. 
“Go ahead.” 

“What?” 

“I said go ahead.” 

“Me?” 

“Who else? /’m not going to 
eat that stuff. This was your 
idea.” 

“But I can’t,” Arnold said, 
perspiring. “I’m the research end 
of this team. I have to stay here 
and — uh — collate data. Besides, 
I’m allergic to greens.” 

“I’ll collate the data this time.” 
“But you don’t know how! I 
have to work up a few new stains. 
My flow sheets are all messed up. 
I’ve got several solutions cooking 
in the stove. Tm running a pol- 
lenation test on — ” 

“You’re breaking my heart,’’ 
Gregor said wearily. “All right, 
I’ll go. But this is absolutely the 
very last time.” 

“Right you are.” Arnold quick- 
ly pulled a handful of invisible 
leaves from the bowl. “Here, eat 
this. That’s it. take some more. 
What docs it taste like?” 

“Cabbage,” Gregor mumbled, 
munching. 

“I’m sure of one thing,” Arnold 
said. “The effects can’t last very 
long on a creature of your size. 
Your system should throw off the 



SQUIRREL CAGE 



139 




drug in a matter of hours. You’ll 
reappear almost immediately.” 

G regor suddenly became in- 
visible except for his clothes. 
“How do you feel?” Arnold 
asked. 

“No different.” 

“Eat some more.” 

Gregor ate another double 
handful of leaves. And, suddenly, 
he was gone. Clothes and all, he 
had vanished. 

“Gregor?” Arnold called anx- 
iously. 

“Are you anywhere around?” 
Arnold asked. 

There was still no answer. 
“He’s gone,” Arnold said out 
loud. “I didn’t even wish him 
luck.” 

Arnold turned to his solutions 
boiling on the stove and lowered 
the flame under them. He worked 
for fifteen minutes, then stopped 
and stared around the room. 

“Not that he should need any 
luck,” Arnold said. “There can’t 
be any real danger.” 

He prepared his dinner. Half- 
way through it. with a forkful of 
food poised in front of his mouth, 
he added, “I should have said 
good-by.” 

Resolutely, he put all dark 
thoughts out of his mind and 
turned to his experiments. He 
labored all night and fell ex- 
hausted into bed at dawn. In the 
afternoon, after a hurried break- 



fast, he continued working. 

Gregor had been gone over 
twenty-four hours. 

The Seerian telephoned that 
evening and Arnold had to as- 
sure him that the slegs were 
nearly under control. It was just 
a matter of time. 

After that, he read through his 
rodent manuals, straightened his 
equipment, rewired an armature 
in the Morganizer, played with a 
new idea for a sleg trap, burned a 
new crop of invisible plants and 
slept again. 

When he awoke, he realized 
that Gregor had been gone over 
seventy-two hours. His partner 
might never return. 

“He was a martyr to science,” 
Arnold said. “I’ll raise a statue to 
him.” But it seemed a very meag- 
er thing to do. He should have 
eaten the plant himself. Gregor 
wasn’t much good in unusual 
situations. He had courage — no 
one could deny that — but not 
much adaptability. 

Still, all the adaptability in the 
world wouldn’t help you inside 
a sun, or in the vacuum of space, 
or — 

He heard a noise behind him, 
and whirled eagerly, shouting, 
“Gregor!” 

But it was not Gregor. 

TPHE creature who stood before 

Arnold was about four feet 
tall and had entirely too many

limbs. His skin color appeared to 
be a, grayish-pink, under a heavy 
layer of dirt. He was carrying a 
heavy sack. He wore a high 
peaked hat on his high peaked 
head, and not much else. 

“You aren’t Gregor, are you?” 
Arnold asked, too stunned to 
react properly. 

“Of course not,” the creature 
replied. “I’m Hem.” 

“Oh . Have you seen my 
partner, by any chance? His 
name is Richard Gregor. He’s 
about a foot taller than I, thin 
and — ” 

“Of course I’ve seen him,” Hem 
said. “Isn’t he here?” 

“No.” 

“That’s odd. Hope nothing 
went wrong.” He sat down and 
proceeded to scratch himself in- 
tently under three armpits. 

Feeling giddy, Arnold asked, 
“Where do you come from?” 
“From Oole, naturally,” Hem 
said. “That’s where we plant the 
scomp. And it comes out here.” 
“Just a moment.” Arnold sat 
down heavily. “Suppose you 
start at the beginning.” 

“It’s perfectly simple. For gen- 
erations, we Oolens have planted 
the scomp. When the scomp is 
young, it disappears for a few 
weeks. Then the mature plant ap- 
pears again in our fields and we 
harvest it and eat it.” 

“You’re going too fast for me. 
Where did you say Oole is?” 



“Gregor says Oole is in a 
parallel universe. I wouldn’t 
know about that. He appeared in 
the middle of my fields about 
two months ago and taught me 
English. Then — ” 

“Two months?” Arnold echoed. 
He considered. “Different time 
framework, I suppose. Never 
mind. Go on.” 

“Do you have something to 
eat?” Hem asked. “Haven’t eaten 
in three days. Couldn’t, you 
know.” Arnold handed him a loaf 
of bread and a jar of jam. “Well, 
when they opened the new North 
Territory,” Hem said, “I put in 
an early bid. So I packed my ani- 
mals, purchased three class B 
wives and departed for my claim. 
Once there, I — ” 

“Stop!” Arnold begged. “What 
has this got to do with any- 
thing?” 

“This is how it all happened. 
Don’t interrupt.” 

S CRATCHING his left shoul- 
der with one hand while stuff- 
ing bread and jam in his mouth 
with two others. Hem explained, 
“I reached the new territory and 
planted scomp. It blossomed and 
disappeared, as always. But when 
it reappeared, most of it had been 
consumed by some creature. 
Well, farmers have to expect 
trouble, so I planted again. The 
next crop was still too poor to 
harvest. I was furious. I de-

termined to continue planting. 
We pioneers are a determined lot, 
you understand. But I was just 
about to give up and return to 
civilization when your partner 
came — ” 

“Let^me see if I understand so 
far,” Arnold said. “You are from 
a universe parallel to ours. This 
scomp you plant grows in two 
universes, in order to complete 
its development.” 

“That’s correct — at least it’s 
how Gregor explained it to us.” 

“It seems an odd way to grow 
food.” 

“We like it,” the Oolen said 
stiffly. He scratched behind all 
four knees. “Gregor says that our 
plants usually penetrate some un- 
inhabited part of your universe. 
But this time, when I sowed in 
new territory, the scomp came up 
here.” 

“Aha!” Arnold cried. 

“Aha? He didn’t teach me that 
word. Anyhow, Gregor helped 
me. He told me I didn’t have to 
abandon my land; I just had 
to use my other fields. Gregor 
assures me that there is no one- 
to-one spatial correspondence be- 
tween parallel universes, what- 
ever that means. And this is in 
payment for our other business.” 

Hem dropped the heavy sack 
on the floor. It made a loud clunk 
as it landed. Arnold opened it and 
peered inside. 

The bars of yellow metal look- 



ed exactly like gold ingots. 

Just then, the telephone rang. 
Arnold picked it up. 

“Hello,” Gregor said, from the 
other end. “Is Hem there yet?” 

“Yes . .” 

“He explained it all, didn’t he? 
About the parallel universe and 
how the scomp grows?” 

“I think I understand,” Arnold 
said. “But — ” 

“Now listen,” Gregor contin- 
ued. “Before, when we destroyed 
the plants, he sowed them again. 
Since his time is much longer 
than ours, they grew here over- 
night. But that’s over. He’s mov- 
ing his fields. The next time you 
destroy the scomp, it’ll stay de- 
stroyed. Wait a week, then turn 
the cats and the Morganizer 
loose.” 

Arnold shut his eyes tightly. 
Gregor had had two months to 
figure all this out. He hadn’t. It 
was happening too fast for him. 

“What about Hem?” he asked. 

“He’ll eat some scomp and go 
home. We had to starve it out of 
ourselves to get here.” 

“All right,” Arnold said. “I 
think I — just a minute! Where 
are you?" 

Gregor chuckled. “There’s no 
one-to-one correspondence be- 
tween parallel universes, you 
know. 1 was standing on the edge 
of the field when the scomp wore 
off. I came out on the planet 
Thule.” 



SQUIRREL CAGE

“But that’s on the other side of 
the Galaxy!” Gregor gasped. 

“I know. I’ll meet you back on 
Earth. Be sure to bring the gold.” 

Arnold hung up. Hem had 
gone. 

It was only then that Arnold 
realized he hadn’t asked Gregor 
what the other business was, the 
business that the Oolen had paid 
for in solid gold. 

H e found out later, when they 
were both back on Earth, in 
the offices of AAA Ace. The job 
was done. The slegs, returned to 
visibility, had been decimated by 
the cats and the Morganizer. 
Their contract was completed. 
They had to forfeit part of their 
profit, because the job ran two 
weeks overtime, but the loss was 
more than made good by the bars 
of Oolen gold. 

“His fields were overrun with 
our cats,” Gregor told Arnold. 
“They were scaring his livestock. 
I rounded them all up and we 
sold them to the Oole Central 



Zoo. They never saw anything 
like them. He and I split the 
take.” 

“Well,” Arnold said, rubbing 
the back of his neck, “it all 
worked out for the best.” 

“It certainly did.” 

Gregor was ferociously scratch- 
ing his shoulder. Arnold watched 
for a moment, then felt a strong 
itching sensation on his chest — in 
his hair — on his calf — every- 
where. 

Carefully, he reached down 
and probed with his fingernails. 

“I guess we aren’t quite 
through, though,” Gregor said. 

“Why?” Arnold asked, scratch- 
ing at his left biceps. “What is 
this?” 

“Hem wasn’t the most hygienic 
of people and Oole was a pretty 
scrubby place.” 

*‘What is it?'* 

“I’m afraid I picked up a lot 
of lice,” Gregor said. He scratch- 
ed at his stomach. “Invisible lice, 
of course.”
