A YOUNG lady who hap- 
pens to like GALAXY is 
distressed because her 
family and friends jeer at her for 
reading science fiction. She un- 
happily wonders whether detail- 
ing the scientific qualifications of 
our writers may not compel their 
respect. 

Well. Asimov is a biochemist 
specializing in cancer research; 
Heinlein is an engineer; Tenn is 
an anthropologist: de Camp, as 
a patent authority, is familiar 
with many branches of science; 
Guin. connected with a large 
pharmaceutical house, is a medi- 
cal expert . 

The list could be extended in 
almost every scientific direction 
— and. I think, would do no good. 

GALAXY ran into a similar 
situation when it was recently in- 
terviewed on TV, with a noted 
mystic to provide “conflict.” 
Summing up at the end of the 
program, this gentleman stated 
that science fiction is a cheap 
substitute’ for prophecy. 

To such calcified thinking, 
there was no contradiction in 
making this deeply thoughtful 
statement over a medium that 
had been anticipated — rtoi pre- 
dicted — generations ago in science 
fiction, with people thousands of 
miles away seeing and hearing 



him at 
bled hi5 

Selling ITim" Icicncc fiction 
might have been possible if we 
were extrapolating possible de- 
velopments in metaphysics. Tm 
not even sure of that. He prob- 
ably doesn’t think any advance 
in his specialty is either likely or 
necessary. 

Oddly, I can see him. or his 
colleagues, setting up shop on the 
planets when we reach them — as 
we seem certain to do— and not 
changing that opinion or their 
primitive “science” in any degree 
whatever. 

This is admittedly an extreme 
case of fossilization. In the ex- 
ample of our reader’s family of 
friends, we have people who are 
unwonderingly alive in a society 
that to their ancestors would have 
been pure science fiction. They, 
of course, take every advance as 
perfectly natural. 

Yet each advance was “impos- 
sible” before it came about. And 
then that one was possible, but 
the next wasn’t! 

Should they be educated to aa 
appreciation of science fiction? 
Why bother? 

I wish I had noted the author 
who said that no idea is as pow- 
erful as one whose time has come. 
Science fiction is in that position.

• ALAXY SCIENCi FICTION 



Us arrival is a matter of logical 
evolution. How widespread its in- 
fluence may become is difficult 
to determine now, but surely it 
will find a legitimate and endur- 
ing place in literature. 

Beyond seeing that the favorite 
magazines of readers are promi- 
nently displayed on newsstands, 
and passing the word to receptive 
people, not much else has to be 
done. The young lady is obvi- 
ously concerned with gaining ap- 
proval; that’s a personal problem 
I can’t handle, one that is prob- 
ably unnecessary— certainly not 
a good betting proposition — and 
not a question of survival for sci- 
ence fiction. 

Its day, as I said, has come. 
Fighting the popular acceptance 
of science fiction now is as fool- 
hardy as were our attempts to 
sell it prematurely. At that time, 
we were forcing something for 
which there was no. current need. 

Wc were, in other words, push- 
ing evolution, which does not re- 
spond gratifyingly to untimely 
pressure. 

Two such instances are the 
movement for spelling reform and 
Communism. For different rea- 
sons. both are guilty of trying to 
force evolution. 

Language needs no compulsion 
to change. It does so constantly; 
if need be, over the dead bodies 
of lexicographers and pedants. 

It changes when there is a need 



for ch&nge, not because someone 
decides that it should. 

Much of our vocabulary would 
be incomprehensible to anyone of 
50 years ago, let alone Chaucer’s 
age. It may be that TV and 
movies will impair the spelling 
ability of future generations — 
though not necessarily their lit- 
eracy, which, in the sense of 
vicarious experience, could im- 
aginably be greater than ever 
before. 

In that case, what we might 
regard as poor spelling would be- 
come standard, through common 
usage. 

Regrettable? No. Inevitable, if 
it does happen. The premature 
proponents of simplified spelling 
would, no doubt, feel victorious, 
but actually their efforts would 
not influence the change. 

Communism, on the other 
hand, puts a gun to evolution’s 
back. You can’t shoot evolution 
if it refuses to obey. This strange 
and repugnant wedding of al- 
legedly advanced politics with 
medieval methods of inquisition 
runs counter to evolution. From 
slavery to feudalism to democ- 
racy, the direction has been 
toward greater and greater per- 
sonal freedom. 

We are assured that that is 
Communism’s ultimate goal. But 
where are the signs of it? 

My money is on evolution.

HE door-knob turned, then 
rattled. 

Dr. David Wong stepped 
out from behind the large book- 
case, listening. He pressed the 
brass handle of the top shelf and 
the case silently pivoted back to 
become part of the wall, obliter- 
ating the dark passage behind it. 

An imperative knocking began 
at the door; David walked softly 
to his desk and picked up his 
notebook. He tried to remain re- 
laxed, but he could feel the tight- 
ening of his shoulder muscles. 
With his right hand, he shut his 
notebook and concealed it under 
a mass of papers, while his left 
hand pressed the desk button to

release the lock of the door. 

The door burst open and two 
men strode in, a black-uniformed 
Ruler followed by a watchguard. 
Black -visored cap still on his 
head, the first man marched to 
the desk and spoke without cere- 
monial greeting. 

“The door was locked, Dr. 
Wong?” 

“Correct, Dr. Lanza. The door 
was locked.” 

“I shall have to instruct the 
guard to report it. Have you for- 
gotten Leader Marley’s Maxim: 
Constructive science does not 
skulk behind locked doors?” 

Wong leaned back in his chair 
and smiled at his visitors.

“The wisdom of Leader Marley 
is a constant help to us all, but 
his generosity is also a byword. 
Surely you remember that on the 
tenth anniversary of his acces- 
sion, he honored me by the grant 
of occasional hours of Privacy, 
as a reward for my work on Blue 
Martian Fever?" 

“I remember now,” said Dr. 
Lanza. 

“But what for?" asked Officer 
Blagun. “It’s anti-social!” 

“Evidently you have forgotten. 
Officer Blagun, another Maxim 
of Leader Marley: Nature has 
not ecuipped one Category to 
judge the needs of another; only 
the Leader understands all. Now, 
Dr. Lanza, will you tell me the 
reason for this visit? Since your 
promotion from Research to 
Ruler. I have rarely been honored 
by your attention.” 

“I am here with a message,” 
said Lanza. “Leader Marley’s 
compliments, and he requests 
your presence at a conference on 
next Wednesday at ten in the 
morning.” 

“Why did you have to deliver 
that in person? What’s wrong 
with using Communications?” 
“It’s not my province to ask 
questions. Dr. Wong. I was told 
to come here, and I was told to 
wait for a reply.” 

“Next Wednesday at ten? Let’s 
see. this is Friday.” David Wong 
pressed the key of his electronic

calendar, but he had no need to 
study the dull green and red 
lights that flashed on to indicate 
the pattern of his day. He did 
not delude himself that lie had 
any real choice, but he had 
learned in the past fifteen years 
that it kept up his courage to 
preserve at least the forms of in- 
dependence. He allowed a decent 
thirty seconds to ponder the 
coded lights, then blanked the 
board and looked up with an easy 
smile. 

“Dr. Wong’s compliments to 
Leader Marley, and he will be 
honored to attend a conference 
on Wednesday at ten.” 

Nodding his hehd, Dr. Lanza 
glanced briefly around the office. 
“Queer, old-fashioned place you 
have here.” 

“Yes. It was built many years 
ago by a slippery old politician 
who wanted to be safe from his 
enemies. Makes a good place for 
Research, don’t you think?” 

Lanza did not answer. He 
strode to the door, then paused 
to look back. 

“You understand. Dr. Wong, 
that I shall have to report the 
locked door? I have no choice.” 

“Has anyone?” 

Officer Blagun followed his 
superior, leaving the door wide 
open behind them. Wong re- 
mained rigid in his chair until 
the clack of heels on marble floor 
bad become a mere echo in his 

S 



brain, then stretched out his hand 
to the intercom. He observed with 
pride that his hand did not trem- 
ble as he pressed the dial. 

*‘Get me Dr. Karl Haslam . 
Karl? Can you meet me in the 
lab right away? IVe thought of 
a new approach that might help 
us crack the Wlhte Martian prob- 
lem. Yes, I know we planned on 
conferring tomorrow, but it’s get- 
ting later than you* think.’* 

Again he pressed the dial. *^Get 
me Leah Hachovnik. Leah? I’ve 
got some new stuff to dictate. Be 
a good girl and come along right 
away.” 

Breaking the connection, he 
diew out his notebook and 
opened it. 

^David Wong was a big man, 
tall, well-muscled, compact, and 
he might have been handsome 
but for a vague something in his 
appearance. His lean face and 
upeurving mouth were those of 
a young man; his hair was a 
glossy black, too thick to be dis- 
ciplined into neatness; and he 
was well-dressed, except for the 
unfashionable bulging of his 
jacket pocket, where he carried 
a bulky leather case of everfeed 
pens and notebooks. But it was 
his eyes that were disconcerting 
—an intense blue, brilliant and 
direct, they had a wisdom and a 
comprehension that seemed in- 
congruous in so young a face. 

A worried frown creased his 



forehead as he turned back to one 
of the first pages, studying the 
symbols he had recorded there, 
but he looked up without expres- 
sion on hearing the tapping of 
slender heels. 

‘‘Quick work, Leah. How are 
you this morning?” 

“As if anybody cared!” Leah 
Hachovnik settled down before 
the compact stenograph machine, 
her shoulders slumped, her thin 
mouth drooping at the corners. 

“Feel like working?” said 
David. 

“As much as I ever do, I guess. 
Sometimes I wonder if the trai- 
tors in the granite quarries have 
it any worse than I do. Some- 
times I wish I’d been born into 
some other Category. Other peo- 
ple have all the luck. I don’t 
know what it is. Dr. Wong, but I 
just don’t seem to have the pep 
I used to have. Do you think it 
could be the climate here in New 
York?" 

“People do grow older. Leah,” 
he reminded her gently. 

“I know. But Tanya — you re- 
member my twin sister Tanya, 
the one that got so sick that time, 
ten years ago, when you did that 
experiment with Blue Martian 
Fever, and she had to be sent out 
to Arizona? Of course I haven’t 
ever seen her since then — people 
in Office Category never get per- 
mission for that kind of travel— 
but she writes me that ever since 






OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



she got well again she feels just 
like a kid, and works as hard as 
she ever did, and she still seems 
to enjoy life. Why, she’s had three 
proposals of marriage this past 
year alone, she says, and yet she’s 
thirty-five, just the same age as I 
am — being twins, you know?— 
anB nobody’s proposed to me in 
j ages. Well, I’m certainly going 
to try to find out what her 
method is. She’s coming back 
tomorrow.” 

“She’s what?" 

“Coming back. BureauMed is 
sending her back here to the In- 
stitute to take up her old job in 
Intercom. Funny they haven't 
told you, her being an old em- 
ployee and all.” 

Dr. Wong was gripping his 
notebook iry stiff fingers, but he 
replied easily, “Oh, well, Bureau- 
Med is a complex organization. 
With all they have to do, it’s not 
surprising they get things mixed 
up sometimes.” 

“Don’t I know!” she sighed, 
and droned on in a dreary mono- 
tone. “This one institute alone 
would turn your hair gray before 
your time. I don’t know how 
some people seem to keep so 
young. I was just -thinking to 
myself this morning when I 
watched you walking through the 
1 office, ‘Why, Dr. Wong doesn’t 

seem to age a bit! He looks just 
as young as he ever did, and look 

at me!’ ” 



Looking at her, David admit- 
ted to himself,' was not the pleas- 
ure it had once' been. Ten years 
ago, she and her twin sister 
Tanya had been plump, delecta- 
ble, kittenish girls, their mental 
equipment no more than standard 
for Office Category, of course, 
but tlieir physical appearance had 
been outstanding, almost beauti- 
ful enough for Theater Category. 
Creamy ivory skin, gray eyes, 
and soft red hair dramatized by 
a freakish streak of white that 
shot abruptly back from the cen- 
ter of the forehead, Tanya’s 
swirling to the left, and Leah’s to 
the right, one girl the mirror im- 
age of the other. 

But the Leah sitting before him 
now was thin and tired-looking, 
her sallow skin was lined, and 
her soft voice had become vine- 
gary with disappointments. Her 
red hair had faded to a common- 
place brown, and the white streak 
in the center was yellowed. An 
unwanted, souring old maid. But 
there was only one response to 
make. 

“You look fine to me, Leah,” 
he said. “What time did you say 
your sister is coming?” 

“Tomorrow evenings’ Play- 
ground Jet. Why?” 

“We’ll have to think of a way 
to celebrate. But right now. I’d 
like to get started on my new 
paper. I’ve got to meet Dr. Has- 

1am before long.”

“I know.” She raised her faded 
gray eyes. ‘‘That was a funny 
thinj you said to him just now 
over the intercom. You said to 
him it was getting late. But it 
isn’t late. It's only eleven o’clock 
in the morning.” 

David stared. ‘‘Do you mean 
to say you were listening to our 
conversation? Why did you do 
that?*' 

She fidgeted and turned away 
from him. ‘‘Oh. I just happened 
to be at Comdesk and I guess 
the circuit wasn’t closed. Does it 
matter? But it seemed a funny 
thing for you to say.” 

“People in Office Category are 
not supposed to understand Re- 
search,” he said severely. “If they 
were capable of Research. Leader 
Mlirley’s planners would have 
placed them there. As for its be- 
ing late, it is. as far as White 
Martian Fever is concerned. 
Which is the subject of my paper. 
Prepare to take dictation.” 

Shrugging her shoulders, she 
poised her bony fingers over the 
keys of the little machine. 

“Paper for delivery at the Sum- 
mer Seminar.” he began. 

“But, Dr. Wong, that doesn’t 
have to be ready for three months 
yet!” 

“Miss Hachovnik! Please re- 
member Leader Marley’s Maxim : 
Individuals born into Office Cate- 
gory are the bone and muscle of 
the State; Nature has designed 



them to act, not to think.” 

“Yes. Dr. Wong. I’m sorry.” 

“Don’t worry, Leah. We’re old 
friends, so I won’t report you. 

All set?” 

He took a pencil from his 
leather case and tapped it against , 

his notebook as he ruffled the 
pages, wondering how to begin. 

It was hard to think logically j 

when a part of his mind was in “ 

such confusion. Had Leah been 
listening in to all of his phone 
conversations? If so. it was for- 
tunate that he had long ago de- 
vised an emergency code. Was it 
only idle curiosity that liad 
prompted her or was she acting 
under orders? Was anyone else 
watching him, he wondered, 
listening to his talk, perhaps even 
checking the routing of his ex- 
perimental work? There was 
Lanza this morning — why had he 
come unannounced, in person, 
when a Communications call 
would have served the purpose 
equally well? 

Leah’s voice broke in. “I’m 
ready. Dr. Wong.” 

He cleared his throat. “. the 
Summer Seminar. Title: The 

Propogation of White Martian 
virus. Paragraph. It will be re- 
membered that the early at- 
tempts to establish Earth colonies 
on Mars were frustrated by the 
extreme susceptibility of our peo- 
ple to two viruses native to the 
foreign planet, viruses which we 



t 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



designate as Blue Martian and 
White Martian, a<icording to the 
two distinct types of fever which 
they cause. Blue Martian Fever 
in the early days caused a mor- 
tality among our colonists of 
nearly eighty-five per cent, and 
made the establishment of per- 
manent colonies a virtual impos- 
sibility. 

"Under the inspired leadership 
of Leader Marley and with the 
advice of his deputy Dr. Lanza, 
this laboratory in Research 
worked out a method of growing 
the virus and producing an im- 
munizing agent which is effective 
in nearly all human beings. Only 
the cooperation of several Cate- 
gories made possible such a feat. 
It will not be forgotten that even 
the humblest helpers in the In- 
stitute had their share in the 
project, that some of them acted 
as human volunteers in the ex- 
periments, well knowing the risks 
they ran, and were afterward re- 
warded by a Free Choice. 

"One person in Office Category, 
for instance, was given the privi- 
lege of learning to play the flute, 
although nobody in his family 
had ever belonged to Music, and 
another person in Menial Cate- 
gory was permitted a month’s 
study of elementary algebra, a 
nearly unheard of indulgence for 
a person in his position. But as 
Leader Marley so graciously re- 
marked in conferring the awards: 



To the individual who risks 
much, the State gives much.” 
"Like me and Tanya?” the 
girl asked, stopping her typing. 

"Yes, like you and Tanya. You 
were allowed to act a part in an 
amateur Theater group, I re- 
member, and since Tanya was 
made too ill to be able to use a 
Free Choice, she was sent out 
west to the Playground, just as 
though she had belonged to Ruler 
Category. Now where was I?” 

" ‘The State gives much.’ ” 
"Oh, yes. Paragraph. Since the 
discovery of the immunizing 
mechanism to Blue Martian, per- 
manent colonies have been estab- 
lished on Mars. But there remains 
the more elusive problem of 
White Martian Fever, which, 
though its mortality is only thirty 
per cent, is still so crippling to 
those victims who survive that 
the Martian colonies cannot be- 
gin to expand, and the resources 
of the planet cannot be fully 
developed, until an immunizing 
agent is found. 

"For the past eight years this 
laboratory has been working at 
the problem, among others, and 
we are now in a position to report 
a small degree of progress. Since 
it proved to be impossible to 
grow the virus in the usual media, 
it occurred to us — ” 

The intercom buzzed, and Dr. 
Wong turned away to open the 
dial.

“David? What’s happened to 
you? I’ve been waiting here in 
the lab a quarter of an hour.” 
“Sorry, Karl. I thought I had 
more time. Be right down.” 

He reached for his white lab 
coat and shoved his long arms 
into the starched sleeves. “That’s 
all we have time for now, Leah. 
Can you get an early lunch and 
be back here this afternoon at 
two?” 

But she was not listening. She 
was leaning over to look at the 
desk, staring avidly at the open 
pages of Dr. Wong’s notebook. 
Without comment he picked up 
the book, closed it, put it in the 
top drawer and locked the drawer. 
She watched him with curious 
eyes. 

^What funny marks those were, 
Dr. Wong! Do you keep your 
notes in a private system of short- 
hand?” 

“No. I write them in Coptic. 
For the sake of privacy.” 
“What’s Coptic?” 

“A dead language, spoken by 
the ancient Egyptians thirty or 
forty centuries ago.” 

“But you’re Research, not Lin- 
guistics! It’s against the law for 
you to know other languages. 
Are you a traitor?” 

“My dear Leah,” he said, “I’m 
far too sensible a man to go in 
for bootleg study, to learn any- 
thing without permission. I have 
no wish to end up with a pick-ax 



in my hands. But you shouldn’t 
tax your little mind with think- 
ing. It’s not your job. You’re not 
equipped for it, and it’s danger- 
ous.” 

D avid passed the watchguard 
stationed in the basement 
corridor, walked through the 
open door of the laboratory, past 
the bench where a row of pretty 
technicians sat making serial dilu- 
tions of bacterial and virus sus- 
pensions, through the glow of the 
sterilizing room, and on into the 
small inner <ab where flasks of 
culture media and developing 
hens’ eggs sat in a transparent in- 
cubator, and petri dishes flecked 
with spots of color awaited his 
inspection. 

Dr. Karl Haslam was standing 
at the work bench, with a pair 
of silver forceps which held a 
small egg under the psi light. 
Gently he lowered the egg into 
its warm observation chamber, 
covered the container, and sat 
down. 

“Well, here I am. What!s gone 
wrong? Explain yourself, my 
boy.” 

“Just a minute.” Grinning ma- 
liciously, David took down a bot- 
tle from the shelf of chemicals, 
poured a colorless liquid into a 
beaker, and walked casually to- 
ward the doorway as he agitated 
the mixture of hydrogen sulphide 
and mercaptans. He held his

Iwcath, then coughed, when the 
fumes of putrescence filled the 
room and drifted out the door. 
He looked into the technician’s 
room. 

“Sorry for the aroma, girls, but 
this is a vital experiment.” 

“Can’t you at least shut the 
door?” one called pleadingly. 

“Explain to the watchguard out 
there, will you?” Closing the 
door, he turned on the ventilator 
and sat down beside Dr. Haslam. 

“Why all the melodrama?” 
Karl asked, baffled. “First you 
call me by emergency code, then 
you hole in like a conspirator. 
I’m beginning to think you’re a 
great loss to Theater. What’s hap- 
pened? Why is it later than I 
think?” 

“Do you take everything as a 
joke, Karl?’* 

“Certainly, until I’m forced to 
do otherwise. What’s worrying 
you?” 

“I’m afraid of being arrested 
for treason. Don’t laugh! This 
morning I received a message, 
delivered in person by our old 
schoolmate Lanza, to report to 
Leader Marley on Wednesday, 
and Marley hasn’t paid any at-

another thing, Leah Hachovnik is

she weren’t so clumsy about her 
prying. I’d almost believe she was 



under orders to spy on me.” 
Karl moved impatiently. “I 
hope you’re not turning psy- 
chotic. You have a clean record 
of continuous production and 
you’ve never mixed in politics. 
You’ve never expressed what you 
may really think of our Leader 
even to me. although we’ve been 
friends since we were in Med- 
school, and 1 hope you never will. 
And you’re making progress with 
White Martian. Why, my boy, 
you’re all set! What’s treasonable 
about that?” 

Someone knocked at the door. 
Hastily David uncovered the 
fragrant beaker and waved it 
about as he called, “Come in!” 
The watchguard looTced in for 
an instant, wrinkled his nose, and 
quickly shut the door. Laughing, 
David covered the beaker, and 
began walking about with long 
nervous strides, snapping his 
fingers as he tried to explain. 

“I’m in trouble, Karl. I’ve run 
into something I don’t know how 
to deal with, and I need help, I 
need advice, I need cooperation, 
Tve lived alone with this thing 
for ten long years, hoping month 
after month that something 
would turn up so I could evade 
the issue. But nothing has. And 
now there’s going to be a show- 
down.” 

Karl touched his arm sympa- 
thetically. “My dear boy — ” 
**That’s it!” shouted David.

“What’s what?” 

“That’s what I'm trying to tell 
you. Why do you always call me 
your ‘dear boy?’ You know I’m 
a year older than you are.” 

“It’s just habit, I suppose. You 
look so young — your hair is 
black, while mine is nearly white. 
You’re full of vigor, while I be- 
gin to creak with middle age. I 
didn’t realize that I irritated you 
with my little phrase. I should 
think you’d be pleased that you 
have somehow managed to sip at 
the fountain of youth.” 

David sank down on a stool. 
“I’m not pleased. I’m terrified.” 
“What do you mean?” 

“I mean that’s exactly what’s 
happened. I have sipped at the 
fountain of youth. I’ve discov- 
ered how to keep people from 
growing old. I myself have not 
aged a bit in the last ten years.” 
There was a long silence. Karl 
tat unmoving, his face like stone. 

“I don’t believe you,” he said 
at last. 

“It’s no longer a question of 
belief. In a few days everybody 
will know, the proof will stare 
you in the face. And what will 
happen then?” 

“Evidence?” Karl asked. “I 
can’t accept a statement as a 
fact.” 

“Would you like to sec my 
mice? Come with me.” 

David Wong hurried into the 
small animal room and paused 



before a stack of wire cages in 
which furry creatures darted and 
squeaked. 

“You remember when we were 
working on Blue Martian, those 
peculiar mutants we found in our 
mice, and how I used six of them 
in trying to make antibodies to 
the virus?”^ 

“I remember,” said Karl. 
“They were spotted with tufts 
of white hair on the right fore- 
legs.” 

David took down a cage, thrust 
in his hand, and brought out two 
of the tiny black mice which 
crawled over his trembling hand. 
Their right forelegs bore tufts of 
long white hair. 

“These,” he said, “are the same 
mice.” 

“Their descendants, you mean. 
Mice don’t live that long.” 

“These mice do. And they’ll 
go on living. For years I’ve lived 
in fear that someone would notice 
and suspect the truth. Just as for 
years, every time someone has 
laughed and told me I never 
seemed to age a day, I’ve been 
terrified that he might guess the 
truth. I’m not aging.” 

Karl looked dazed. “Well, my 
boy, you’ve got a bear by the 
tail. How did you find the elixir 
or whatever it is?” 

“You remember the early work 
with radioactive tracers, a couple 
of hundred years ago, that proved 
that all our body cells are in a 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



continuous state of flux? There’s 
a dynamic equilibrium between 
the disintegration and the resyn- 
thesis of the essential factors such 
as proteins, fats and amino 
groups, but the cell directs all 
the incoming material into the 
right chemical structures, under 
the influence of some organizing 
power which resides in the cell. 

“Foreign influences like viruses 
may disrupt this order and cause 
cancer. The cells arc continu- 
ally in a state of change, but al- 
ways replace their characteristic 
molecules, and it is only as they 
grow older that tliey gradually 
become ‘worn out.’ Then the body 
grows old, becomes less resistant 
to infection, and eventually suc- 
cumbs to one disease or another. 
And you know, of course, that 
viruses also have this self-dupli- 
cating ability. 

“I reasoned that at birth a 
man had a definite, finite amount 
of this essential self-duplicating 
entity — SDE — in his body cells, 
.a kind of directing factor which 
reproduces itself, but more slowly 
than do the body cells. In that 
case, with the normal multipli- 
cation of the cells, the amount of 
SDE per cell would slowly but 
surely grow smaller with the 
years. Eventually the time would 
come when the percentage would 
be below the critical level — ^the 
cells would be less resistant, 
would function with less effi- 



ciency. and the man would ‘grow 
old.’ ’’ 

Karl nodded soberly. “Reason- 
able hypotliesis.” 

“But one day, by pure chance, 
I isolated a component which I 
recognized as being the factor es- 
sential to the normal functioning 
of body cells. It hit me Tike a 
toothache. I found that I could 
synthesize the SDE in the lab, 
and the only problem then was 
to get it into a man’s cells. If I 
could do that, keep the SDE level 
up to that of youth, a man would 
stop aging! Since viruses pene- 
trate our cells when they infect 
us, it was no trick at all to effect 
a chemical coupling of the SDE 
to the virus. I used Martian Blue, 
since it was handy, and its effects 
ar* usually brief. 

“Presto! Old age is held at bay 
for another twenty or thirty years 
-—I really don’t know how long. 
These mice were my first experi- 
ment, and as you see, they’re still 
alive. Next, I tried it on myself.” 

David put the mice back in 
their cage, locked it. and returned 
to the lab. 

“Tomorrow, the whole thing is 
bound to come out because 
Tanya Hachovnik is coming 
back. You know her sister Leah 
— gray, dried-up. soured on life. 
Well, I’ve had ways of checking, 
and when Tanya Hachovnik 
walks into the Institute, everyone 
will see her as the same luscious

redhead of twenty-five we knew 
ten years ago. I realize that what 
I did was a criminal act. I didn’t 
think the thing through or I 
wouldn’t have been such a fool. 
But when I made those final ex- 
periments, I used the Hachovnik 
twins for a controlled pair.” 

“You must have been crazy!” 



“Perhaps I was. I’d tried it on 
myself, of course, with no bad 
effects except a few days’ fever, 
but I realized that without a con- 
trol I never could be sure the 
SDE was actually working. It 
might be just that my particular 
genetic constitution caused me to 
age more slowly than the average.

GALAXY SCIENCI MCTION 



So I chose the twins. To Leah I 
gave the attenuated Martian 
Blue, but to Tanya I gave the 
simple Blue coupled with SDE. 
The experiment worked. Identi- 
cal twins — one grows old like 
other people; the other remains 
young. I know now. Karl, how to 
prolong youth indefinitely. But 
what in the name of Leader Mar- 
ley shall I do with my knowl- 
edge?” 

Karl Haslam absently twisted 
his white hair and spoke slowly, 
as though he found trouble in 
choosing his words, 

“You realize, of course, that it 
is your duty to acquaint Leader 
Marley with all the details of 
your discovery?” 

*Ts it? Can you imagine what 
this will do to our society? What 
about the generations of children 
coming into a world where no 
places have been vacated for them 
by death? What about the strug- 
gles for power? Who will decide, 
and on what basis, whether to 
confer or to withhold this gift? 
There’ll be riots, civil wars. I 
know that I’m only a scientist; 
all I ever wanted from life was 
to be left alone, in a peaceful 
laboratory, and let other people 
worry about the world and its 
troubles. But now — don’t you see 
that by the mere fait that I made 
this discovery. I’ve lost the right 
to sit by quietly and let other 
people make the decisions?’' 

CATEGORY PHOENIX 



“But, David, you and I aren’t 
able to handle such a problem! 
We’re only Research!” 

“I know. We’re inadequate, yet 
we have the responsibility. The 
men who created atomic power 
probably felt inadequate, too, but 
could they have made as bad a 
mess of handling it as others did? 
Suppose I did turn this over to 
Marley — he’d use it to become 
the most absolute tyrant in the 
history of the race.” 

Karl ran his fingers through 
his hair and smiled crookedly. 
“Well, you could always start a 
revolution, 1 suppose, and start 
by assassinating the Leader.” 
“With what kind of weapon? 
Men like you and me are not al- 
lowed to own so much as an old- 
fashioned pistol. Except for the 
Military, Marley’s the only man 
allowed to wear a Needier. And. 
besides, I’m a Research, not a 
Military. I hate violence and I’m 
naturally conditioned against kill- 
ing.” 

“Then you shouldn’t have got 
into this mess. It would have been 
far better never to have discov- 
ered this SDE. I presume your 
notes are safely locked up, by the 
way?” 

David grinned. “Don’t worry 
about my notes; they’re written 
in Coptic. You remember when I 
was still in Medschotol and made 
my first important discovery, how 
to prevent the development of 

15 



hereditary baldness by the injec- 
tion of certain parahormones? 
Leader Marley rewarded me with 
a Free Choice, and I chose to 
learn a dead language. Not half 
a dozen men in the world could 
read my notes.” 

“If your notes are safe, why 
don’t you just destroy your mice 
and get rid of your proof that 
way?” 

“And the Hachovnik twins?” 

“You could at least keep Tanya 
out of sight.” 

“Don’t be a fool. That would 
only be a temporary measure and 
has nothing to do with the real 
problem. Lanza and Marley may 
suspect the truth right now, for 
all I know; they keep such close 
watch on my work. Anyway, the 
secret is bound to come out sooner 
or later.” 

Dr. Haslam clasped his hands 
and stared at them for a long 
while. His lined face looked 
grayer than ever. 

He looked up at last with a 
faint smile. “Well, my boy, I 
never asked you to discover this 
stuff, but since you have — I 
hereby burn my bridges! You’re 
right, we can’t give it- to Marley. 
But you can’t handle it alone. 
What we need is time, and we 
haven’t got it. We shall both be 
liquidated before this is over, 
there’s no doubt of that, but we 
must do what we can. When is 
Tanya arriving?” 



“Tomorrow night, on the Play- 
ground Jet.” 

“And you see Leader Marley 
when?” 

“Next Wednesday.” 

“Five days yet. Then this is 
what we’ll do. Too bad Lanza is 
in the other camp, but there’s 
you and me, and I think Hudson 
and Faur4 from Serology will 
come in with us. We’ll need others 
— sociologists, anthropologists, 
psychologists — the most promis- 
ing material from all Categories 
if we’re to create a new society 
based on the prospect of im- 
mortality. But I’ll see the first 
two and bring them to your 
apartment tomorrow night for 
Tanya’s welcome-home party. I 
leave it to you to muzzle Leah.” 

“That won’t do,” said David. 
“I ‘don’t have a current Free 
Choice,” 

“But I have. Two, as a matter 
of fact, a reward for curing the 
insomnia of Leader Marley’s 
wife. I choose to give a party, I 
choose tomorrow night, and I 
choose your apartment.” 

A knock rattled the door, and 
the watchguard thrust in his 
head. “How much longer is this 
here experiment going to take? 
Do you guys'' want to be re- 
ported?” 

“Just finishing, Officer,” called 
Karl. “You can leave the door 
open now.” 

“What a stink!” said the guard.

“Thank God I’m in Military!'* 

I T hardly seemed like a party, 
D^vid thought. His guests 
were ill at case, and their con- 
versation labored, then stopped 
altogether when the Menial came 
into the library with a tray of 
glasses and niblets. 

“Put them on the liquor cab* 
inet, James.*' said David. “And 
that will be all. Enjoy yourself 
tonight.” 

The Menial put down the tray 
and then stooped to fumble with 
the lock. 

“Let that alone! I’ve told you 
a thousand times not to monkey 
with my liquor cabinet!” 

“Don’t you want me to get out 
the ice cubes. Doctor?” 

“I’ll do it. You can go now.” 
“But are you sure you won’t 
want me later in the evening, 
Doctor? Who’s to serve the sup- 
per? Who’s going to clear up 
afterward?” 

“We’ll manage. Don’t worry 
about us.” 

James shuffled out of the room. 
“I suppose that means III 
manage,” said Leah, with a self- 
pitying sigh. “I’ve noticed that 
whenever people decide to rough 
it and do without a Menial, they 
take it for granted the women 
will do the work, never the men 
— -unle^ the women are still 
young and pretty. Well, at any 
rate. I’ll have Tanya to help me.

I still don’t see why you wouldn’t 
let me go to the Port to meet her. 
Dr. Wong.” 

“I just thought it would be 
more of a celebration if we had a 
surprise party all waiting for her 
to walk into. Dr. Haslam will 
bring her here directly from the 
Port, and here we all are, her old 
friends from the Institute, wait- 
ing to welcome her home.” 

“I’d hardly say all.” said Leah. 
“I’m the only person from Office 
that’s here. And why have a party 
in your Library, Dr. Wong? 
Nothing here but books, books, 
books.” 

“Because I keep my liquor 
here, in the only room I have a 
right to lock up. My Menial is a 
good man, but he can’t resist an 
opened bottle.” 

“Well, it’s still a gloomy party.” 

David turned apj>ealingly to 
his other guests, Hudson and 
Faure, but they only looked un- 
comfortable. 

“Perhaps we need a drink.” 
David unlocked the cupboard 
and picked up a bottle which he 
set down hastily when he heard 
voices in the hall. He hurried to 
the outer door and opened it a 
few inches to reveal the sturdy 
shoulders of the watchguard of 
the floor and, beyond him. Karl 
Haslam. 

“Everything in order. Officer?” 
asked Karl. 

“Your permit is in order, Dr. 

\r 



Haslam. A private party. Let me 
just check — yes, three guests have 
arrived, and you two make five. 
That all? You have until mid- 
night. But it beats me why you 
people in Research prefer a* party 
without a watchguard. or why 
Leader Marley ever gives per- 
mission. Why, in all my years in 
Military, I’ve never been to an 
unwatched party, and I must say 
it never held us down any.” 

Karl laughed a little too 
forcedly. “I’ll bet it didn’t! But 
all Research people are a little 
peculiar. You must have noticed 
that yourself.” 

••Well—” 

“And you know how generous 
Leader Marley is, and how kind 
he is to loyal citizens. He wants 
U!^to be happy, so he pampers us 
now and then.” 

"1 guess he knows what he’s 
doing, all right. Well. I’ll check 
you out at twelve, then.” 

“Go on in. Tanya.” said Karl. 

They stepped into the apart- 
ment and David quietly closed 
the door. 

"Hi, Sis,” drawled Leah. "You 
made us wait long enough I” She 
walked toward the girl, hand out- 
stretched. then stopped with a 
gasp of disbelief. 

Tanya's red hair was still bril- 
liant and gleaming, her creamy 
skin unlined^ and her full red lips 
curved up into a friendly smile as 
she leaned forward for a sisterly 



kiss. But Leah jerked away and 
glared with anger. 

A puzzled frown creased Tan- 
ya’s lovely white forehead. " 

"What’s the matter, Leah? 
Aren’t you glad to see me? You 
look so strange, as though you’d 
been terribly ill!” 

Leah shook her head, tears of 
rage gathering in her pale eyes. 
“I’m okay,” she whispered. “It’s 
you. You haven’t changed. I 
have. You’re still young, you’re 
pretty, you’re just the way / used 
to be!” She whirled to face David, 
her voice choking. 

"What have you done to her. 
Dr. Wong?” 

The four men in the room were 
all staring at the sisters, scarcely 
believing what they saw, although 
they had all been prepared for 
the contrast. The twin sisters were 
no longer twins. One had retained 
her youth; the other was faded, 
aging. 

“This is awful,” Ha.slam mut- 
tered. “Absolutely ghastly.” He 
put a comforting hand on Leah’s 
shoulder, and with a deep sob she 
hid her face against him and 
cried. 

Hudson and Faur€ could not 
take their eyes from Tanya, and 
David leaned against the wall to 
stop his trembling. 

“Sit down, all of you.” he said. 
"First we’ll have a drink. I’m 
sure we all need it. Then we’ll 
face — what has to be faced.”

A n hour later, they had 
achieved a calmness, of sorts. 
They had given up some of their 
normal sobriety to achieve the 
calm, but they were grateful to 
the drug for cushioning the shock. 

David paced the floor, glass in 
hand, talking rapidly as he fin- 
ished his long explanation. 

“So you see what happened,** 
he said. “When I began the ex- 
periment, I had no idea how stag- 
gering the results might be. That 
is. I knew in my mind, but I 
never imagined the realness of 
what would happen. I thought 
of it as just an experiment.** 
Leah sniffed, her resentment 
somewhat dulled by drink. “So I 
was just an experiment! Don’t 
you ever think about people’s 
feelings? I know I’m not as good 
as you are; I’m only Office, but 
I’m human.” 

Karl patted her harid. “Of 
course you are, Leah. But that 
is one of the defects of people in 
Research — they forget about hu- 
man emotions.” He looked up 
sternly at David. “They go ahead 
with their experiments, and hang 
the consequences. If Dr. Wong 
had had any sense, he would 
never have kept this a secret for 
ten years, and we might have 
had ten years to prepare ourselves 
for such a responsibility. Instead, 
we have only a few days or, at 
most, weeks. Hudson! Faure! 
How do you feel about this thing 



now? Are you still game?** 

Both men seemed a little dazed, 
but Faur6 pulled himself to- 
gether, speaking slowly, like a 
man in a dream. 

“We’re with you. It’s still hard 
to believe: we’ve got immortal- 
ity!” » 

“I’d hardly call it immortal- 
ity,” said Hudson drily, “since, 
as I understand it, SDE does not 
kill disease entities, nor ward off 
bullets or the disintegrating nuc- 
lear shaft of the needier — as we 
will very likely find out before 
very long. But what do we do 
now? When people see these two 
girls together, it won’t be an, hour 
before Marley hears about it.” 

David spoke up with a new 
authority. “He must not hear 
about it. I know how poorly 
equipped I am to handle this 
situation, but since I created it, I 
must assume responsibility, and 
I have made my plans. 

“First, you, Tanya. Try to 
realize that if the Leader finds 
out that I have this secret of 
keeping youth, he will want it for 
himself. Nobody in Menial, no- 
body in Office, nobody in Re- 
search — almost nobody at all — 
will be allowed to benefit from it. 
Marley will use it as a special 
reward for certain Rulers, and he 
will try to keep its very existence 
a secret so that people in general 
will not be envious or rebellious. 
That means that he will have to

get rid of you.” 

“Get rid of me? But I haven’t 
done any harm!” 

“Just by existing and letting 
people look at your unchanging 
youth, you will be a threat to 
him. for you will give away his 
secret. How he’ll deal with you, 
I don’t know. Concentration 
camp, exile, or more probably, 
simple execution on grounds of 
treason, such as unauthorized 
choices of activity or study. It 
doesn’t matter, he’ll find a way. 
The only safety for you is in 
keeping hidden. You must stay 
quietly in Leah’s apartment un- 
til we can find a refuge for you. 
Do you see that?” 

She looked around in bewilder- 
ment. “Is that right, Dr. Haslam? 
And what will they think at the 
Institute? I’m supposed to go 
back to my job in Intercom.” 
“Dr. Wong is right,” he said 
kindly. “Please believe us. it’s 
hard for you to understand that 
we are asking you to do some- 
thing secret, but just try to re- 
member that you are, after all, 
an Office Category and are not 
equipped by training or constitu- 
tion to think out problems like 
this. We’ll tell you what is the 
right thing to do. You just do as 
we tell you. and you’ll be per- 
fectly safe.” 

Leah snickered. “Oh, she’ll be 
safe enough, being as pretty as 
she is! What are you going to do 



about me? Don't I count?” 
“We’ll come to that in a few 
minutes. Right now, we need food. 
Leah, you and Tanya be good 
girls and go out to the kitchen 
and heat up some supper for us. 
After we’ve eaten, we’ll talk about 
you.” 

A S soon as the girls were out 
of the room, the four men 
drew together at the table. 

“No use burdening them with 
too much knowledge,” Karl re- 
marked. “Even as it is, they are 
a great danger to us, and the 
less they know the better. David, 
will you proceed?” 

“I have little to add to the 
plans we made last night at the 
lab. The thing we need most is 
time; and next to that, a hiding 
place. We may very soon be 
classed as traitors, with every 
watchguard on the continent 
hunting for us. We will take care 
that they don’t find us. Now, you 
said last night that each one of 
you has accumulated a Free 
Choice during the past year, 
which hasn’t yet been used.” 
“That’s right,” said Faur^. "I 
intended to use mine next winter 
to live among the Australian ab- 
origines for a week. I’ve been 
wanting that for years, but the 
planners always refused me; it 
was a project without practical 
purpose.’* 

“And I intended to use mine

to attempt a water-color paint- 
ing,” added Hudson. “In my boy- 
hood I hoped to be put in Arts 
Category, but the Planners 
laughed at me. I suppose it’s 
wrong, yet I still have the yen.” 

“You have my sympathy,” 
said Karl. “I was going to take 
an Aimless Tramp. Just shed my 
identity and wander on foot 
through the great north area of 
woods and Jakes.” 

David sighed.' “Well, if we are 
successful in hiding and in chang- 
ing the world as we’d like, you 
can all three be free to do as you 
like without asking permission. 
But at present that’s only the 
wildest of dreams. And. first, we 
must find our refuge. Today is 
Saturday. Tomorrow morning, 
each of you will go to BureauMed 
and claim your Free Choice. And - 
each of you will choose an Aim- 
less Tramp.” 

“But I don’t like hiking,” ob- 
jected Hudson. 

“You won’t be hiking. You’ll 
take off in your roboplanes and 
then disappear. You will be with- 
out supervision. You will then 
proceed, disguised as you think 
suitable, to find a place for our 
new colony — somewhere in South 
America? — and make preliminary 
arrangements to receive us. You 
must be back by Tuesday aftei^^ 
noon at the latest. On Tuesday, 
as soon as you have reported 
back to ^ureauMed, get to the 



Institute as fast as you can.** 
“Why the deadline?'* 

“Because by Tuesday after- 
noon, sometime before evening, 
probably, I expect all three of 
you to be suffering from an attack 
of Blue Martian Fever, and I 
want you to get expert hospital 
care. You will be the nucleus b£ 
the new regime.” 

Karl laughed. “I wish you 
could have picked a base for 
your SDE that was less unpleas- 
ant than Blue Martian.” 

“Who’s got Blue Martian?** 
asked Tanya, as the girls came in 
from the kitchen with their trays 
of food. “I’ll never forget how 
sick it made me.” 

“You should worry,” said Leaht 
“It kept you young and beauti- 
■ful, didn’t it?” 

“You won’t have to envy her, 
Leah,” said David going to the 
liquor cabinet. “I’m going to give 
you and the others a shot of the 
SDE-Martian Blue. Sometime 
Tuesday afternoon you should 
feel the first symptoms. But after 
forty-eight hours in the hospital, 
you’ll be good as new. And you 
will all stop growing older.” 

They watched, fascinated, as 
he opened the cooling compart- 
ment of the liquor cupboard. 

“I always like plenty of ice in

ing out a tray of cubes and open-

There was a knock at the door, 
and David stopped. 

"What is it?” he called. 

"Me,” came the watchguard’s 
voice. “Just thought I’d do you 
a favor and tell you it’s only ten 
minutes till checkout time. Time 
to get yourselves decent!” 

They could hear the rumble of 
his laugh as he moved on down 
the hall. Trembling, David picked 
up a bottle, poured alcohol onto 
the rubber cap, and deftly filled 
the sterile syringe. He reached for 
a piece of cotton, dipped it in 
iodine, and looked up, waiting. 
K9rl Haslam had already bared 
his left arm. David swabbed the

spot on the upper deltoid. 

Karl laughed. “Here I come, 
Methuselah!’* 

“All set?" asked David. 

He plunged the needle home. 

r\AVID ran up the steps of the 
Institute, two at a time, and 
hurried toward his office through 
the echoing corridors, where the 
usual watchguard sauntered on 
patrol. 

“Morning. Jones." 

“Good morning, Doctor. Pretty 
early, aren’t you?” 

“Wednesday’s my busy day.” 
He settled at his desk, miserably 
conscious of the open door and 
curious eyes behind him, opened 
his briefcase, then glanced at his 
wristwatch. More than an hour 
before his interview with Leader 
Marley. 

Spreading some data sheets be- 
fore him, he looked at them 
blankly as he tried to order his 
thoughts. His eyes were ringed 
with dark depressions, for he had 
had no sleep. There had been so 
many things to plan for, so many 
arrangements to make. 

It was possible, of course, that 
this morning’s talk would turn 
out to be mere routine. There 
might remain several weeks of 
freedom — ^but there might be only 
a few hours. He shrank from the 
complexity of the problem before 
him: he was a Research man, de- 
voted to his test tubes and his 



culture growths, and would have 
been happy never to face any 
problem beyond them. 

He had a moment’s revulsion 
at the unfairness of the fact that 
a simple experiment in the lab, 
an addition to man's knowledge 
of the Universe, should have 
plunged him against his will into 
a situation far beyond his ability 
to handle. There had been, as 
Karl pointed out. the alternative 
of turning the SDE over to the 
Leader. That would have ab- 
solved him of all responsibility. 
But that was the trouble, he 
thought. Responsibility could not 
be confined to squiggles in his 
notebook, when those squiggles 
might affect the whole of society. 

“Dr. Wong!” 

He jumped and turned around 
hastily. 

“Leah! What in the world?” 

She stood in the doorway, glar- 
ing at him, breathing heavily as 
though she were trying to hold 
back sobs. Slowly she tottered 
to the desk and sank down into 
her chair by the stenograph. 

“You doublecrosser!” she whis- 
pered. 

He looked quickly at the door- 
way, but the guard had not come 
back. Leaning forward, he ques- 
tioned her fiercely. 

“What are you doing here? 
They told me yesterday that sev- 
eral people had come down with 
attacks of Blue Martian. Why

aren’t you in the hospital with 
the others?” 

‘‘Because I wasn’t sick!” 

“But I gave you — ” 

“Imagine how I felt,” she raced 
on. “watching Dr. Haslam start 
having a chill, hearing Dr. Faure 
complain about his awful head- 
ache, and listening to Dr. Hudson 
dial Intercom and call for a doc- 
tor. And all that time I was wait- 
ing, waiting for something to 
happen to me. And nothing did! 
What have you got against me, 
Dr. Wong, that you infect all the 
others and only pretend to do it 
to me? I don’t want to grow old 
any more than they do!” 

“But I wasn’t pretending. 
Quiet, now, and let me think.” 
waited until the watchguard 
had passed by the door, then 
raised his head. 

“Look here. Leah, Evidently 
the infection didn’t take. This is 
what must have happened. That 
treatment I gave you ten years 
ago must have made you perma- 
nently immune to Blue Martian, 
and the antibodies it formed in 
your cells simply protected you 
against this nc-w invasion of the 
virus. It never occurred to me 
that the immunity would last so 
long. But don’t worry. I’ll find a 
way.” 

She looked suspicious. “What 
do you mean?” 

“I mean that there’s no reason 
why Blue Martian should be the 



only vehicle for giving you the 
SDE. There must be other viruses 
that will work equally well. It’s 
only a question of finding one.” 
“And how long will that take 
you?” 

“How long does anything take 
in Research? Maybe a week, 
maybe a year.” 

“And maybe ten! I can’t wait, 
Dr. Wong. I’m thirty-five now; 
I’m growing older. What good 
will a long life do me, if it only 
preserves me as the middle-aged 
woman I’ll be by then? And all 
those years that I'll be getting 
older and older, there’ll be Tanya, 
lively and pretty, to remind me 
that I was once like that, too. I 
can’t face it!” 

“The watchguard will hear 
you!” Haggard-faced, he watched 
her shaking shoulders, hearing her 
muffled sobs. 

“You’re a criminal, Dr. Wong! 
It was a crime, what you did to 
Tanya and me.” 

“I didn’t realize in the begin- 
ning or I'd never have touched 
the thing. I know it now. even 
better than you do. but what can 
I do?” 

She looked up and wiped her 
eyes, her mouth set hard. “1 know 
what I can do. I can report you 
to the Leader.” 

“What good will that do? You 
know how terrible you feel now 
about being left out — though I 
swear I never meant it to be like

this. But just try to imagine. If 
you report me so that Leader 
Marley gets the secret of SDE, 
then thousands of people will be 
put in just the same situation you 
are in. You’re only one person 
suffering. But then there’d be 
hundreds of thousands, millions! 
Surely you wouldn't want to 
have that on your conscience?” 

“Do you think I’d care?” 

“You would when you felt 
calmer. You’re wrought up, ill. 
Let me send you home. Promise 
me you’ll go home quietly, talk 
it over with Tanya, and not say 
anything to anyone else. I’ll think 
of a way out for you. Just be 
patient.'* 

"Patient!” 

He thought of calling Karl 
Haslam. Karl would know best 
how to deal with her, how to 
bring her back to reason. He 
reached toward the intercom, 
then dropped his hand in despair. 
Karl was in the hospital, with 
Fauree and Hudson, shivering 
with the cold of Blue Martian 
fever. But he had to get her away. 

He pressed the intercom dial. 
“Dr. Wong speaking. Miss Hach- 
ovnik is ill and is being sent home. 
Please send an aircab for her at 
once.” 

He helped Leah to her feet, 
and spoke pleadingly. 

“Promise you’ll be good, 
Leah?” 

The fury in her eyes nearly

knocked him down. Without • 
word, without a gesture, she 
walked out. 

T\AVID felt as though he’d 
been put through a wringer 
as he followed Officer Magnun 
into the Leader’s suite at State 
House. Several nights of sleep- 
lessness, the worries of planning 
for a refuge, and the scene with 
Leah had left him limp and spirit- 
less. The girl was a danger, he 
knew, but she was only one of 
many. 

He nodded at Dr. Lanza, who 
was busy reading reports from 
BureauMed, and saluted Leader 
Marley, who was talking with a 
watchguard. 

Marley looked up briefly. “Sit 
down, Wong.” 

David folded himself into a 
chair, grateful for a few moments 
in which to collect himself, while 
Marley gave the last of his orders. 

“Put them in the Vermont 
granite quarries, and keep them 
at work for the next year.” 

“As you say. Leader. With the 
usual secrecy, of course?” 

“No, you blockhead! These arc 
a bunch of nobodies. Use all the 
publicity you can get. Keep a 
punishment a secret and how can 
it have any effect on other peo- 
ple? No, I want full radio and 
news coverage and telecast show- 
ings as they swing the first pick 
at the first rocks. People’ have 

25 



got to realize that the Leader 
knows best, that treason doesn’t 
pay. No matter how clever they 
think they are, they’ll always get 
caught. Understand?” 

“As you say. Leader.” 

‘‘Then get going.” As the guard 
left the room, Leader ^Marley 
turned to David. “What fools 
people are!” 

He ran his beefy hands through 
a shock of black hair, blinked his 
eyes, and wrinkled the heavy 
, black brows that met over his 
nose. Wonderingly. he shook 
his massive head as he drew his 
gleaming needier from his breast 
pocket and played with it, tossing 
it from hand to hand while he 
talked. * 

“^’m probably the most gener- 
ous Leader the State has had 
since the Atomic Wars, Wong, 
and I never withhold a privilege 
from someone who has deserved 
it. But people mistake me when 
they think that I am weak and 
will overlook treason.” 

“Your generosity is a byword, 
Leader Marley,” said Wong. “But 
some people are incapable of act- 
ing for their best interests even 
when you have defined it for 
them. Who are these latest trai- 
tors?” 

“Oh, nobody really important, 
of course, except as they waste 
time which they owe to the State. 
Jiist attempts at illegal study. An 
Office Category who had found 



a basement room in a deserted 
building and was spending all his 
evening hours there practicing 
the violin. A Theater man who 
was illegally trying to learn car- 
pentry. And a teacher of mathe- 
matics who had forged a key to 
the Linguistics library, and had 
been getting in every night to 
study a dead language — Cunei- 
form, Latin, something like that, 
utterly without practical value. 
This last one is an old man, too, 
and ought to have known better. 
People must be made to realize 
that if they want the privilege 
of useless study, they will have 
to earn it. And I am very broad- 
minded in such cases.” 

“Nobody has better reason to 
know that than I, Leader Marley, 
and I am always grateful to you.” 
Marley coughed and straight- 
ened the jacket over his bearlike 
chest as he put back his needier. 

“Now to business. Where*s that 
memorandum, Lanza?” 

Dr. Lanza handed him the 
paper, then sat down beside the 
Leader, 

, “First. When Dr. Lanza called 
on you last week, he found the 
door to your office locked. What 
explanation do you have?” 
David smiled and spread his 
hands. “My explanation is the 
generosity of Leader Marley. You 
have so many affairs to occupy 
your attention that it is not sur- 
prising that you do not remember 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



rewarding me with a Free Choice 
some years ago, for my work on 
Martian Blue. I chose, as I am 
sure you remember now, an oc- 
casional hour of Privacy.” 

The Leader blinked. “That’s 
right. I had forgotten. Well, the 
Leader never goes back on his 
word. Though why in the name 
of Marley you fellows want a 
crazy thing like that is beyond 
me. What do you do, behind a 
locked door, that you don’t want 
anyone to see?” 

“Do you doubt my loyalty. 
Leader Marley?” 

“I doubt everything. What do 
you want with Privacy?” 

Lanza broke in amiably. “I’m 
afraid we just have to accept 
such wishes as one of the harm- 
less abnormalities of the Re- 
search mind, Leader. Since I grew 
up in that Category, I understand 
it to some extent.” 

“You’re right in calling it ab- 
normal. I think perhaps I’d bet- 
ter remove that from the possible 
Choices in the future. It could 
easily be misused, and it never 
did make any sense to me. 

“Well, second. It’s been more 
than three years since you re- 
ported any progress with the 
problem of White Martian Fever, 
Wong. What is your explana- 
tion?” 

“Research is not always swift. 
Leader.” 

“But I distinctly ordered you 



to find an immunizing agent 
within three years. Our colonies 
on Mars cannot wait forever. I've 
been patient with you, but you’ve 
had more than enough time.” 

“I am very sorry, Leader Mar- 
ley. I have done my best and so 
have my colleagues. But the 
problem is complex. If I may 
explain, we had to find a suitable 
culture medium for growing the 
virus, and then we had to work 
at the problem of coupling it 
with suitable haptens — ” 

Impatiently, Marley waved his 
hand. “You know I don’t under- 
stand your jargon. That’s not my 
business, what troubles you’ve 
had. I want results. You got re- 
sults on Blue Martian quickly 
enough.” 

“We were fortunate. But when 
we storm the citadel of knowl- 
edge, Leader Marley, no one can 
predict how long it will take for 
the citadel to fall.” 

“Nonsense! I’m warning you, 
Wong, you’re failing in your duty 
to the State, and you can’t escape 
the consequences with poetic 
doubletalk. I allow special privi- 
leges to you people in Research 
and I expect a proper apprecia- 
tion in return. When I order you 
to produce a protection for White 
Martian, I want results!” 

“But you can’t get a thing like 
that just by asking for it. Such 
things are simply not und?r your 
control.”

“Watch yourself, Wong! Your 
remarks are dangerously dose“to 
treaEon!” 

“Is it treason to tell you a 
plain fact?” 

Stony-faced, David stared de- 
fiantly at Marley, trying to con- 
trol the trembling of his*body. If 
he had had a needier at that in- 
stant, he realized incredulously, 
he would have shot the Leader 
and thought his own life a small 
price to pay for such a pleasure. 

Lanza coughed. “Lm afraid Dr. 
^Wong is not well, Leader. Worry- 
ing over the slowness of his work 
has distorted his reactions. But I 
am sure that you will understand, 
as you always do, and be indul- 
gent.” 

“J^’ll overlook your remarks, 
Wong,” said Marley, relaxing. 
.“But you’d better change your 
attitude. You Research people 
cause me more trouble than any 
other three Categories put to- 
gether. Sometimes I wonder if a 
spell in the granite quarries 
mightn’t — ” 

A light flashed on his desk. He 
watched the blinking code for a 
second, then ro^e abruptly and 
left the room. 

The tv/o ' men sat in silence. 
David glanced at Lanza, and 
Lanza shifted in bis chair. 

“Thanks for t!’.e good v/ord,” 
•aid David wcruily. “How do you 
like being a Ruler, by the way? 
When we were at Medschool to- 



gether, I thought you were a man 
with ideas.” 

“When I was at Medschool I 
didn’t know what was good for 
me,” Lanza replied stiffly. 

“And you think you do now?” 
A slow flush crept over Lanza’s 
face. “Look here, Wong! E^ch 
man has to make his own terms 
with himself. Don’t act so smug! 
You shut yourself away inside the 
nice white walls of your labora- 
tory and ignore all the conflicts 
of life. You shut your ears and 
your eyes, live in perfect har- 
mony with your test tubes, and 
let the world go hang. Well, that 
isn’t my way.” 

“Your way. apparently, is to 
worm yourself into the confidence 
of that steel-hearted imbecile who 
rules our lives and our thoughts, 
and spend twenty-four hours a 
day saying. ‘Yes, Yes,’ and wait- 
ing for him to die so you can step 
into his shoes!” 

“V/e’re alone,” Said Lanza. “I 
won’t report you. But I have no 
intention of justifying myself. 
Have you any idea why you’ve 
been let alone for so long? You 
haven’t produced anything tangi- 
ble in several years. Haven’t you 
ever wondered why no one put on 
the pressure? Haven’t — ” 

He broke off as Marley lum- 
bered back into the room and 
fell into a chair. The Leader’s 
manner had altered. He stared at 
David with grim inquiry, the

beady eyes traveling slowly over 
him, taking in his rumpled hair, 
his strained face, the rigid set of 
his shoulders. 

At last Marley spoke, his voice 
soft with menace. 

“You’re looking well, Dr. 
Wong. Remarkably well. In fact, 
it occurs to me that you don’t 
seem to have aged a bit since my 
last visit to your laboratory. Tell 
me, how do you keep your 
youth?” 

D avid could feel the rush of 
blood through his body, feel 
the thud of his racing heart. He 
kept his voice low so that it would 
not tremble. 

“Thank you, Leader Marley, 
for your kindness in noticing my 
appearance. I suppose I chose my 
parents well. They both lived to 
be over ninety, you know.” 

"This is no joking matter. I’ve 
just had a report. An epidemic 
of Blue Martian fever has broken 
out among the people of your 
Institute. Why have you not 
mentioned it?” 

"If you will forgive me, Leader 
Marley, I’ve had no chance. I 
reported it in the usual manner 
to the health authorities, and 
have here in my briefcase a mem- 
orandum which I hoped to bring 
to your attention, among several 
other matters, when you had fin- 
ished giving your instructions to 
me.” 



Marley continued implacably, 
"And how did this epidemic be- 
gin? It was my understanding 
that ho insect existed here on 
Earth that could transmit the 
virus. Yet several people from 
your lab came down with the 
disease on the same day. What 
is your explanation?” 

"It’s very simple. To prepare 
the vaccine, as I am sure you 
will remember from your last 
visit to us, we have to keep in the 
lab a limited number of the Faili, 
the Martian insects which act as 
hosts at one stage of the virus% 
life. Last week a Menial care- 
lessly knocked over one of the 
cages and several Fafli escaped. 
The Menial was discharged, of 
course, and put in Punishment, 
but the damage had already been 
done.” 

"You have a very ready ex- 
planation.” 

"Would you rather I had none 
at all. Leader Marley?” 

"Well, let that go.” Marley 
drummed his plump fingers on 
the desk as he continued. "There 
was another report for me just 
now. A report so wild, so incredi- 
ble, so staggering that I can 
scarcely bring myself to take it 
seriously. From an Office Cate- 
gory at the Institute.” 

David’s heart beat wildly, but 
he forced a smile to his lips. ‘*Oh, 
yes. You must mean Miss Hach- 
ovnik. I’ve been worried about

that poor girl for some time.*’ 

- “What do you mean, ‘poor 
girl'?" 

“It’s very distressing to me, be- 
cause she has been a good and 
loyal worker for many years. But 
' she is becoming unstable. She has 
a tendency to burst into tears 
over nothing, is sometimes hys- 
terical, seems to have secret 
grievances, and is extremely jeal- 
ous of all women whom she con- 
siders more attractive. She was 
j never too bright, to be sure, but 
until recently she has done her 
i^ork well, so I’ve hated to take 
any action. Just this morning I 
had to send her home because she 
was ill.” 

“Do you mean to say," asked 
M^ley, “that none of her story 
is true?" 

“I dont know. What is her 
story?” 

“She reports that you have 
been working on a private project 
of your own. instead of on White 
Martian. That you have discov- 
ered a way to make people im- 
tnortal, by infecting them with 
Blue Martian. What is your ex- 
planation?” 

David only stared, his mind so 
blurred with panic that he could 
not speak. His stunned silence 
was broken by a laugh. It was 
Dr. Lanza, leaning backward in 
his chair, holding himself over 
the stomach as he shook his head. 

“These hysterical women!" His 



laughter trailed off to a com- 
miserating chuckle. “You’re too 
forbearing, Wong. You shouldn’t 
keep a worker who’s so far gone. 
Take a leaf from.Leader Marley’s 
book and remember: Kindness is 
often weakness; when it is neces- 
sary for the good of the State, be 
harsh!" 

“I hardly know what to say," 
said David. “I had no idea she’d 
gone so far." 

“Then there’s no truth in it?" 
Marley persisted. “What she says 
is impossible?” 

“Well,” said David judiciously, 
“we people in Research have 
learned not to call anything im- 
possible, but this dream of im- 
mortality is as old as the human 
race. We have a thousand legends 
about it, including the story of 
the Phoenix, that fabulous bird 
which, when consumed by fire, 
rose triumphant from its own 
ashes to begin life anew. A pretty 
story, of course. But I need only 
put it to a mind as logical as 
yours, Leader Marley. Through- 
out all the millenia of m^’s ex- 
istence, the Sun has always risen 
each morning in the east, and 
thus we know that it always will. 
That is the order of nature. Like- 
wise, from the earliest generations 
of man, no individual has ever 
lived longer than a hundred and 
some years, and thus we know 
that he never will. That is the 
order of Nature and we can’t alter 



to

it to the best of my knowledge.** 
Leader Marley was thoughtful. 
He touched the intercom. 

“Send in Officer Magnun.” 
David held- his breath. 

“Magnun, Office Category 
Hachovnik is to be taken from 
her home at once and put in in- 
definite Psycho-detention.” 

Marley stood up. “Very well. 
Dr. Wong. You may go. But I 
shall suspend your privilege of 
Privacy, at least until after you 
have devised a protection against 
White Martian. It is 4iot wise to 
disregard the wishes of the 
Leader. Lanza, show him out.” 

At the street door, they paused. * 
Lanza looked at David specula- 
tively. 

“You do keep your youth well, 
David.” 

"Some people do.” 

“I remember tliat legend of the 
Phoenix. What do you suppose 
the Phoenix did with his new 
life, once he’d risen from the 
ashes of his old self?” 

“I’m no philosopher.” 

"Neither am I. But you and I 
both know that the principle of 
induction was exploded centuries 
ago. It’s true that the Sun has 
always risen in the east. But is 
there anything to keep it. some- 
day, from rising in the west?” 

^1^HAT night David sat late at 
* his desk. Through the open 
door behind him. he could hear 



the watchguard slowly pacing the 
dimly lit corridor. He could fed 
time pressing at his back. He 
was reprieved, he knew, but for 
how long? 

He got up, at one point, when 
the corridor behind him was 
quiet, and went to the bookcase. 
He pressed the brass handle, saw 
the shelves silently swing away 
from the wall, then set it back 
again. The mechanism, installed 
a century ago by a cautious poli- 
tician, was still in good order. 

Back at his desk, he thought of 
Leah and her lost youth, lost be- 
cause of his own impersonal at- 
titude. He felt sorry for her, but 
there was nothing he could do 
for her now. It was a relief to 
know that Tanya, at least, re- 
mained hidden and secure in her 
sister’s apartment. 

It was after midnight before he 
closed his notebook and locked it 
away in the top drawer. His plans 
were completed. There would not 
be time given him, he knew, to 
finish his work on White Mar- 
tian. That would have to be 
dropped, and resumed at some 
more favorable time in the future 
— if there was a future for him. 
But he would begin at once to 
produce in quantity a supply of 
the SDE-Blue Martian, for he 
was sure that the untrained 
guards who watched his move- 
ments would never realize that 
he had shifted to another project,

With a brief good night to the 
guard, he left the building to 
walk home. His shoulders were 
straight, his stride confident, and 
he disdained looking behind him 
to sec if anyone was following. 
He had made his terms with him- 
self, and only death, which he 
would certainly try to prevent, 
could alter his plans. 

Going into his apartment he 
wearily turned on the light. Then 
he froze, feeling as though he 
had been clubbed. Leah Hachov- 
nik was huddled at one end of 
^ the sofa, her face dripping tears. 
“I thought you’d never come,” 
she whispered. 

• He slumped down beside her. 
”How did you get here, Leah? I 
thought you were — ” 

hid in your hallway until 
the watchguard was at the other 
end. When his back was turned, 
I just took off my shoes and 
slipped in. I’ve been waiting for 
hours.” Her voice was almost in- 
audible, spent beyond emotion. 

■ “They got Tanya,” she said 
dully. “They took her away.” 
“What happened? Quick!” 
“After I reported to Bureau - 
•Med — I’m sorry I did that, Dr. 
Wong, but I just couldn’t help 
mysf'lf. I didn’t tell them about 
Tanya and the others, just about 
you. Then I walked around for 
hours, hating you, hating Tanya, 
hating everybody. Finally I got 
•SO tired that I went home. Just as 



I got into the hall, I heard a 
loud knock and I saw Officer 
Magnun at my door. When 
Tanya opened it, he simply said, 
‘Office Category Hachovnik?’ 
When she nodded her head, he 
said, ‘You’re under detention.’ 
She screamed and she fought, but 
he took her away. Since then, 
I’ve been hiding. I’m afraid.” 

David tried to think. He re- 
membered that he had said only 
“Miss Hachovnik” in his talk 
with the Leader. Had Marlcy 
never known that there was more 
than one? But Lanza surely knew. 
Or had he merely assumed that 
Magnun would ask for Leah? 
Would they realize, at Psycho- 
detention, that they had the 
wrong woman? Probably not, for 
she would be hysterica! with ter- 
ror, and her very youth and 
beauty taken in connection with 
the “jealousy and envy of 
younger women” which was noted 
in her commitment order, would 
seem to confirm her madness. He 
was still safe, for a while — if he 
could keep Leah away from the 
Institute. 

“I’m afraid,” she whimpered. 
“Don’t let them put me away.” 

“Then you’ll have to do exactly 
as I tell you. Can you follow 
orders exactly?” 

“Ye*; yes!" 

“I’ll have to hide you here. We 
can fix up my library as a room 
for you. It's the only room I can 



keep locked, and which my Me- 
nial never enters in my absence. 
Whatever happens, Leah — no 
matter what happens — keep 
yourself hidden. More than your 
life depends on that." 

W HEN the three convalescents 
returned from the hospital, 
pale and shaky, David sum- 
moned them to his office. At the 
door, Watchguard Jones looked 
them over. 

“Say, that Blue Martian fever 
sure does take it out of you. You 
fellows look like you’ve been 
plenty sick!” 

“They have been,” said David. 
“Let them by so they can sit 
down and rest.” 

Jones moved aside, but he 
lounged in the doorway, listen- 
ing. 

David ignored him. “Glad to 
see you back, gentlemen. I’ll 
make this brief. You have been 
the victims of a laboratory acci- 
dent just as much as if you’d 
been contaminated with radia- 
tion. Our Leader Marley, who 
understands the problems of all 
Categories, has very generously 
consented to grant you a two 
weeks’ convalescence, in addition 
to a Free Choice. Take a few 
minutes to think over your de- 
cision.” 

He strolled over to the window 
and looked out at the green of 
the trees just bursting into leaf. 



Then, as if on impulse, he turned 
back. 

“While you’re thinking it over, 
will you look at these protocols? 
We discussed them before you 
got sick, you remember — a plan 
to prevent an epidemic of Blue 
Martian. Do you approve of the 
final form? I’d like to carry on, 
and after all,” he added with an 
ironic smile, “it’s getting later 
than we might think.” 

He handed each man a sheet 
of paper whose contents were 
identical. They studied them. 
Karl Haslam was the first to 
speak. 

“You think, then, that other 
cases of Blue Martian may de- 
velop?” 

“It is certainly probable. Those 
Fafli insects were never caught.” 
Karl looked back at his paper. 
It contained a list of names, some 
of which were well known to all 
the country, some of them ob- 
scure. Thoughtfully, he nodded 
as he ran down the list. 

Hudson glanced up, frowning, 
his finger pointed at one name. 

“I don’t know,” he said slowly, 
“that this particular experiment 
would prove useful. Surely the 
Lanza method has not proved to 
be as effective as we once hoped.” 
“You may be right. But there’s 
the bare possibility that the 
modified Lanza method might be 
of enormous benefit to us.” 

“It is uncertain. Too much of

a risk. Tat’s my opmioa.” 

“Then I’U reconsider. The rest 
has your approval? Very well. 
And now what choice have you 
made for your holiday?” 

“I think we are all agreed,” 
said Karl soberly. “We’ll have an 
Aimless Tramp.” " ; 

“An excellent idea,” approved 
David. “Oh, Jones, will you get 
an aircab to take the doctors to 
BureauMed, and then arrange for 
their Roboplanes to be serviced 
. and ready in an hour?” 

don’t know as I ought to 
• leave my post,” said Jones. 

“You’d rather stay with us and 
perhaps be exposed to the Fever?” 

.‘>Dkay, okay!” 

When his footsteps had died 
away. David leaned forward. 

“We’ve done our best. Another 
month or so and we should be 
completely ready for our retire- 
ment act.” 

“If we have a month,” said 
Faur^. 

David grinned. “Well, if our 
time runs out, at least we’ll go 
down fighting. You know all your 
lines, your props are ready, the 
plot is worked out, and we can 
slip into our makeup in an in- 
stant — provided the audience 
shows up.” 

“You’re getting to be quite a 
joker, David,” said Karl. “What 
if the audience comes around to 
the stage door?” 

‘Then we'll try to receive him 



properly. Our Leader is a man of 
iron, but I doubt that he’s im- 
mortal.” 

They heard the approaching 
guard. 

*T’m sure you’ll benefit from 
your holiday,” David went on. 
“That last .checkup showed an 
antibody titer entirely too high 
for safety.” 

“In other words, it’s time for 
us to get going?” asked Karl, 
smiling. 

“That’s right. Only the next 
time the antibody curve rises, it 
will be for keeps.” 

F our days later it was re- 
ported that Judge Brinton, the 
well-known champion of Cate- 
gory rights, was ill with Blue 
Martian fever. Three little-known 
nuclear physicists living in the 
same apartment in Oak Ridge 
developed symptoms on the same 
day. Sporadic cases of Blue Mar- 
tian flared up all over the conti- 
nent. Occasionally a whole family 
was affected — husband, wife, and 
all the children. There was a 
mild epidemic at MIT, a more 
serious one at the School of So- 
cial Structure, and at Harvard 
Medical School nearly a third 
of the senior class, and they the 
most brilliant, were hospitalized 
at the same time. 

Rumors blanketed the country 
like a fog, and people everywhere 
became uneasy. There were no 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



deaths from the illness, but the 
very idea that an infectious dis- 
ease could flare up unpredictably 
all over the nation, put of con- 
trol. was frightening. It was said 
that the disease had been beamed 
to Earth by alien enemies from 
space; that all its victims became 
sterile; or that their minds were 
permanently damaged. 

It was also said, though people 
laughed even as they repeated the 
rumor, that if you once had Blue 
Martian Fever you’d become im- 
mortal. This particular theory 
had been clearly traced to the 
tavings of a red-haired mad- 
woman who was confined to 
Psychodetention, but still it was 
too ridiculous not to repeat. For 
a week, comedians rang a hun- 
dred changes on the basic joke: 

Wife: Drop dead! 

Husband: 1 can’t. I’ve had 
Blue Martian. 

The unrest became so great 
that Leader Marley himself ap- 
peared on the telecaster to reas- 
sure the nation. 

He was an impressive figure on 
the lighted screen, resting solid 
and at ease in a leather chair, 
raising his massive black head, 
lifting his big hand to gesture as 
his rich voice rolled out. 

“You have nothing to fear,” 
he said. “Under your beneficent 
Leaders, infectious disease has 
been wiped out many years ago. 
BureauMed informs me that 



these scattered cases of Blue 
Martian fever have been caused 
by the escape of a few FafU in- 
sects, which have, since then, 
been isolated and destroyed. The 
illness has no serious after-effects. 
And as for the rumors that it 
confers immortality — ” 

He allowed his face to break 
into a pitying smile as he slowly 
shook his head, looking regretful 
and ^et somehow amused. 

“Those who continue to spread 
gossip about the fever will only 
reveal themselves as either psy- 
chotics or traitors. Whichever 
they are, they will be isolated 
for the good of our society.” 

The effect of his words was 
somewhat diminished by the 
brief glimpse people had of Dr. 
Lanza, who reached a hand to 
help the Leader rise. For Dr. 
Lanza wore an anxious frown, 
and his face was thin with worry. 

In spite of numerous arrests, 
the mmors continued. For two 
weeks sporadic outbreaks of the 
fever occurred, and then, abrupt- 
ly, they ceased. 

TT was more than a week after 
^ the last case had been reported 
that David sat in his basement 
laboratory beside the opened 
mouse cage, watching with wry 
affection as the furry creatures 
crawled over his hand. These 
were historic mice, he reflected, 
whose reactions to SDE had 



CATEGORY PHOENIX 



35 



opened up a new world, a world 
which he must somehow help to 
make better than the present one. 

His three colleagues had re- 
turned a few days ago from their 
holiday. They had calmly come 
back to work, and apparently 
nobody had thought to put two 
and two together, and thus con- 
nect the epidemic with the vaca- 
tioners. It had been unfortunate 
that Tanya should have been put 
under arrest; it was difficult try- 
ing to find amusement for Leah 
SO that she would keep out of 
sight, but still, on the whole, 
th^ir luck had been good. 

But it was time for David to 
go back to work in his office. 
Gently he detached the mice 
from his hand, dropped them 
into^ their cage, and closed the 
wire trap. He took his leather 
pencil case and the keys to his 
desk from the pocket of his lab 
coat and laid them on the desk, 
below the nail on which his 
wristwatch hung. Carelessly he 
dropped his lab coat onto the 
desk and reached for his jacket, 
then paused, listening. 

The chatter in the technicians’ 
room suddenly died. In the un- 
natural quiet sounded a steady 
march of feet. 

David turned to meet the prob- 
ing black eyes of Leader Marley. 
Just behind him were Dr. Lanza 
and Officer Magnun. 

There was no time to conceal 



his mice, David realized. Shrug- 
ging into his jacket, he strode 
forward without hesitation, a 
smile on his face, and stretched 
out his hand. 

“Leader Marley! This is in- 
deed an honor. If you had only 
notified us of your visit, we 
should have been prepared.” 
“Young as ever, I see, Wong.” 
“Thank you. Leader.” There 
was no banter in Marley’s eyes, 
he noted, but he continued amia- 
bly. “It has been some years 
since you have honored us by a 
visit in person. I’m afraid a lab- 
oratory is not a very exciting 
place, but I’d be honored to show 
you anything that may be of in- 
terest to you.” 

A faint contempt curled Mar- 
ley’s mouth as he glanced around 
the room. “Nothing to see -that 
I haven’t seen before, is there? 
A lot of test tubes, a bunch of 
flasks, a mess of apparatus you’d 
think had been dreamed up by 
an idiot, and a bad smell. You 
still keep animalsr I notice.*’ 

He sauntered over to the 
bench, picked up the cage and 
looked at the scurrying rodents. 
David scarcely breathed. 
Marley Only nodded. “Well, 
mice are mice.” He put down the 
cage and turned away. “These 
look just like the ones I saw 
when I was here eight or ten 
years ago. Same white patch on 
the forelimbs. I never knew mice 






GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



could live that long." 

“But — ’’ began Lanza, bending 
over to study the mice. 

“What an amazing memory 
you have, Leader,” said David. 
“Just as you guessed, these mice 
are the direct descendants of the 
ones you saw on your former 
visit, a special mutant strain. The 
chief difference is that these are 
marked with white patches on 
the right forelimbs, while, as I 
am sure you recall, the original 
specimens were marked on, the 
left forelimbs. Odd how these 
marks run in families, isn’t it?” 
Lanza put down the cage and 
strolled toward the door as Mar- 
ley took a last bored look around. 

“Nothing new here that I ought 
to see, Lanza?” 

“No. Nothing new.” 

“Well, I’ve no time to waste. 
I’ve come here for two reasons, 
Dr. Wong. We both want a 
booster shot for Blue Martian. 
Ten years is a long time, and 
there’s been this epidemic." 
“Which is now under control.” 
“That may be, but I still want 
a booster. You Research people 
don’t always know as much as 
you think you do. When that’s 
done, I want a detailed report of 
your progress on White Mar- 
tian.” 

“I shall be hapy to give it," 
said David. “If you will go di- 
rectly to my office, I’ll pick up 
the vaccine and syringes, and be 



with you in a few minutes." 

Marley and Officer Magnun 
marched to the door, and David 
followed, standing aside to let 
Lanza precede him. Lanza hesi- 
tated there, staring at the floor. 
Then he smiled and looked di- 
rectly at David. 

“Beautiful spring weather we 
are having. I’m wondering about 
the marvelous order of nature. 
Did you happen to notice, this 
morning, whether the Sun did 
actually rise in the east?” 

David stared at the retreating 
back. There was no longer any 
doubt in his mind. Lanza knew. 
What was he going to do? 

“Hurry up. Doctor,” said Offi- 
cer Magnun from the doorway. 

“Right away.” He opened the 
refrigerator and inspected the 
two groups of red-capped vials 
sitting on the shelf. He had no 
time to think, no time to weigh 
pros and cons; he could only act. 
Choosing two vials, he added 
them to the sterile kit from the 
autoclave, and took a last look 
around. 

He noticed his watch still hang- 
ing on the wall, and the lab coat 
which covered his leather pen- 
cil case. He started to take them, 
then slowly dropped his hand 
and touched the intercom. 

“Get me Dr. Karl Haslam.” 

“You’re keeping the Leader 
waiting," said Magnun, but 
David paid no attention. 



CATEGORY' PHOENIX

“Dr. Haslam? Dr. Wong 
speaking. I may be a little late 
getting up to see those precipi- 
tates of yours. But you keep 
them simmering, just in case. It’s 
very probable that the antibody 
curve will rise. Yes, I’ll let 
you know if I can.” 

Magnun followed him to the 
office, then strolled away for a 
chat with Watchguard Jones. 

David put his things on his 
desk and made his preparations 
in businesslike fashion while 
Marley and Lanza glanced curi- 
ously around the office. He 
watched apprehensively as Mar- 
ley inspected the bookcase, then 
turned away. 

“I never could understand why 
Research needs so many books,” 
he^ remarked. 

“Please roll up your sleeve, 
Leader Marley. I’m ready for 
you now.” 

Deftly he assembled the syr- 
inge, ’filled it to the two centi- 
meter mark, and scrubbed the 
arm presented to him. 

“Ready?” He ihserted the 
needle and slowly expelled the 
fluid. Then, taking a fresh syr- 
inge, he repeated the operation, 
filling from the second vial. 

“Why do those bottles have 
different numbers?” asked Mar- 
ley. “Aren’t we getting the same 
thing?” 

“Certainly. Just lab routine, 
•o we can keep track of how 



many units have been used from 
our stock. There, that docs it, 
Lanza. Both of you will* be per- 
fectly safe for a good many years 
to come.’* 

He was washing his hands at 
the sink when he heard a strug- 
gle at the door. Turning, he saw 
Leah, thin, gaunt and terrified, 
held fast in the grip of Officer 
Magnun, who forced her inside 
and slammed the door behind 
them. 

• “What’s the meaning of this 
intrusion?” demanded Marley. 

“There’s some funny business 
going on, Leader,” said Magnun. 
“I caught this woman trying to 
sneak in here. She says she’s 
Miss Hachovnik and she works 
here. Only she ain’t. I arrested 
Miss Hachovnik myself, and I 
remember well enough what she 
looked like. She was a cute chick, 
not a bit like this dame.” 

Marley was staring at the sob- 
bing girl, eyes blinking as he 
thought, looked back, remem- 
bered. Slowly his eyes shifted to 
David, and David felt like a man 
impaled. 

"You may leave, Magnun,” 
said the Leader. 

“You don’t want me to arrest 
this woman?” 

“Let go of her! I said you may 
leave!” 

“As you say. Leader." 

When the door closed, the 
room throbbed to Leah’s sobs.

“I couldn’t help it, Dr. Wong,” 
she cried. ‘‘I got so bored, sitting 
and looking at those books, day 
after day, with nothing to do! I 
thought I’d just slip down here 
for an hour and say hello to 
people, and — ” 

‘‘Quiet, Hachovnik!” roared 
Marley. He quieted his voice. “I 
understand now, Wong. 1 remem- 
ber. There were two girls. Twins. 
The one in Psycho-detention, ac- 
cording to Officer Magnun, is still 
beautiful and young. It’s no use, 
Wong. You do know the secret 
of immortality. And you told me 
the Phoenix was only a fairy 
tale!” 

D avid felt entirely calm. 

Whatever might happen now, 
at least the suspense was over. 
He had done all he could, and it 
was a relief to have things in the 
open. He thought fleetingly of 
his colleagues, alerted by his 
message, frantically putting their 
plans into operation, but he 
leaned back against the sink with 
every appearance of ease. 

“You’re not quite right. Leader 
Marley. I cannot confer immor- 
tality. All I am able to do is 
stave off the aging process.” 
“That will do me nicely. And 
it’s connected somehow with the 
Blue Martian virus?” 

“Yes. The disease serves as the 
vehicle.” 

With a brisk motion, Marley 

CATEGORY PHOENIX 



drew his needier from his breast 
pocket and aimed it steadily at 
David. “Give it to me!” 

“You’re rather ambiguous,’* 
said David. How were his friends 
getting along? Were they ready 
yet? Had Karl visited the base- 
ment lab? “Do you mean you 
want me to give you the injection 
to prolong your life, or the secret 
of how to do it, or what?” 

“Don’t quibble! First you’ll 
give me the injection to make 
me immortal. Then you’ll turn 
over to me all your notes on pro- 
cedure, Then my friend here will 
needle you with a shaft of elec- 
trons and end your interest in 
the problem.” 

“Surely you won’t keep such 
a good thing all for yourself,” 
said David. “What about Dr. 
Lanza? He’s your right-hand 
man. Don’t you want him to 
live forever, too? What about 
Officer Magnun? He’s a faithful 
servant.” 

“You’re stalling, Wong. Do 
you want me to kill you now?” 
“It won’t be wise to needle 
me yet. Leader Marley. The se- 
cret would be lost forever.” 

“I’ll have your notes!” 

“Yes? Try to read them. 
They’re written in Coptic, a dead 
language that you consider it a 
waste of time to learn, because 
such knowledge is impractical. 
There aren’t half a dozen men 
on Earth who could make head 

39 



or tail of my notebook.” 

"Then I'll find that half-dozen! 
I want the injection.” He ges- 
tured with the gleaming weapon. 

“This is once when I have no 
Free Choice,” said David. “Very 
well.” He started toward the 
door, but halted at the roar of 
command. 

“Stop! Do you think I’m fool 
enough to let you out of my 
sight?” 

“But I have to get the inocu* 
lant.” 

“Use the intercom. Send for 
it.” 

David slumped into the chair 
and opened the intercom. He 
could almost feel the electronic 
shaft of the needier ripping into 
his body. His heart beat wildly, 
arltt the tension of adrenalin ran 
through his body. His lips felt 
cold, but he held them steady as 
he spoke into the dial. 

“Get me Dr. Haslam. 
Karl? David Wong speaking. 
Will you send someone up with 
a vial of phoenix special? 
The precipitates? I should say 
the antibody titer has reached the 
danger point. Don't delay treat- 
ment any longer.” 

Silently th^'iy waited. Marley’s 
grim face did not relax; his eyes 
were alight. Leah lay back in her 
chair with closed eyes, and Lanza 
Stared intently at the floor. 

A soft knock came at the door, 
and a female technician hurried 



in, carrying a tray. 

“I’m sorry to be so slow. Dr. 
Wong. Dr. Haslam had a little 
trouble locating the right vial. 
Oh. and he said to tell you not 
to worry about those precipitates. 
They’re taken care of.” 

“Just a minute,” said David. 
“Leader Marley, Miss Hachov- 
nik here is very ill. Won’t you let 
this girl help her to the rest 
room? She’ll be safe there until 
you’re ready for her.” 

Marley looked at the half- 
fainting woman. “All right. You 
take her there, Lanza, and this 
girl too. Lock them in. And she’s 
not to talk. Do you understand? 
She’s not to talk!” 

“As you say. Leader Marley,” 
the technician whispered. She 
helped Leah to her feet, and 
Lanza followed them from the 
room. 

Marley closed the door and 
locked it. “Now. then, Wong, 
give me that shot, and heaven 
help you if you try any tricks!” 
“Will you bare your arm while 
I prepare the syringe?” 
Awkwardly hanging onto the 
needier, Marley tugged at his 
sleeve while David calmly picked 
up a bottle of colorless liquid and 
filled his syringe. He turned to 
the Leader, swabbed his arm, 
then picked up the syringe. 
“There you are,” said David. 
Jerking the syringe upward, he 
forced a thin jet of pure alcohol

into the man’s eyes. Marley 
screamed. Agonizing pain blinded 
him. and as he clutched at his 
eyes. David snatched the needier 
from the writhing lingers, and 
flashed the electronic dagger 
straight to the heart. 

He stared at the twitching 
body for only an instant. People 
were pounding on the door, 
shouting. He tugged at the desk 
drawer to get his notebook, then 
remembered sickly that he had 
left his keys in the lab. He would 
have to leave his notes. 

The shouts were growing 
louder, people were battering the 
door. Swiftly he moved to the 
bookcase, swung it away from 
the wall, and dropped into dark- 
ness. 

He brought the bookcase back, 
then turned and ran along the 
black passageway. 

T EADER Lanza sat in Ids suite 
at State House, conferring 
with his subordinates. 

"It hardly seems po.ssible, 
Magnun, that so many people 
could have slipped through your 
fingers without help from the 
Military. You say both the Ha- 
chovnik twins have disappeared?” 

“Yes. Leader.” 

"And how many people from 
the Institute?” 

“Six. Leader. But it didn’t do 
them any good. We got them, all 
right.” 



“But you found no bodies!” 
“They wouldn’t have bodies 
after we got through with them. 
Leader.” 

“You’re quite certain. Officer 
Magnun, that all the fugitives 
were destroyed?” 

Lanza looked tired, and his 
officers noticed in him a lack of 
firmness, an indecision, to which 
they were not accustomed in a 
Leader. 

“Say, those babies never had 
a chance. Leader. We picked up 
their roboplanes somewhere over 
Kansas, and we shot them out 
of the air like ducks. They didn’t 
even fire back. They just crashed, 
burned, disintegrated. They won’t 
give you any more. trouble. Why, 
we even picked up the remains 
of Doc Wong’s wristwatch and 
that old beat-up pencil case of 
his.” He flung them on the desk. 

Lanza fingered the charred and 
molten relics. 

“That will do, Magnun. I’ll 
call you when I need you.” 

“Say, ain’t you feeling well. 
Leader? You look kind of green.” 
“That will be all. Magnun!” 
“As you say. Leader.” 

Lanza shoved aside the charred 
remnants and spread out the 
papers waiting for him. the un- 
impiortant, miscellaneous notes 
accumulated over the years by 
Hudson. Faure. and Haslam. 
And the unreadable notebook of 
David Wong. He sighed and

loolced up as his secretary en- 
tered. 

“I’m sorry to disturb you, 
Leader. You look tired." 

“The funeral this morning was 
quite an ordeal, and so much has 
happened the last three days!” 

“Well, I thought you ought to 



know that strange reports are 
coming in. Some of our most 
prominent citizens have disap- 
peared. We’re trying to trace 
them, of course, but — ” 
“Anything more?" 

“Those rumors about Blue 
Martian are cropping up again."

“Yfs? And — ?” 

“That old man you asked me 
to bring from the Vermont quar- 
ries, the one who was detained 
for illegal study of the Coptic 
language? Well, I guess the ex- 
citement of his release was too 
much for him. He died of a heart 
attack when he was being taken 
to the plane.” 

Lanza sighed. “Very well, that 
will be all.” 

Alone at last, he looked sadly 
through the pages of David’s 
notebook, at the tantalizing curls 
and angles of the Coptic letters, 
cryptic symbols of a discovery 
which prevented a man from 
growing old. Well, no one could 
read them now. That secret was 
dead, along with its discoverer, 
because, in this world, no study 
was permitted without a practical 
end in view. And perhaps it was 
just as well. Could any man be 
trusted, he wondered, to deal 
wisely with a power so great? 

After closing the notebook, he 
dropped his head into his hands. 

How his head ached! He felt 
cold, suddenly, and his whole 
body began to shake with a hard 
chill. He lifted his head, his vi- 
sion blurred, and suddenly he 
knew. 

He had Blue Martian fever! 

Teeth chattering, he paced 
wildly about the room, puzzling 
things out, trying to remember. 
That booster shot! And then he

realized the amazing truth: 
David Wong had given him a 
chance! He had inoculated him 
with the seeds of immortality, 
giving him a chance to help right 
the wrongs of this Categorized 
world. And now he was left alone 
in a world of mortals. David and 
the others had been annihilated, 
and he was left to live on and 
on. alone. 

He staggered toward his pri- 
vate apartments, then sank into 
his chair as his secretary once 
again ran into the room. With a 
supreme effort he controlled his 
trembling. 

“Yes?” 

“Leader Lanza. Another re- 
port.” 

‘i^ust a minute,” said Lanza, 
trying to bring his eyes into focus 
on the excited girl. “I am in need 
of a rest. As soon as you have 
gone, I shall retire into seclusion 
for a few days. There are to be 
no interruptions. Is that clear? 
Now, proceed.” 

“There’s a new epidemic of 
Martian Fever reported where 
one never was before.” 

He stirred tiredly. "Where 
now?” 

“South America. Somewhere in 
the Andes.” 

“I think we’ll have just one 
Category after this,” said Lanza 



dreamily. “Category Phoenix.” 

“What did you say, Leader?” 

His thoughts wandered. No 
wonder Magnun’s men found no 
bodies. The planes they shot 
down were roboplanes, after all, 
and it was easy to plant in an 
empty seat a man's wristwatch 
and his bulky leather pencil case. 
David and the others were safe 
now. They were free and had 
enough time to plan for the new 
free world. 

“What did you say. Leader?” 
the girl repeated, bewildered. 

“Nothing. It doesn’t matter.” 
He frowned painfully, and then 
shrugged. “On second thought, I 
may be away longer than a week. 
If anyone asks for me, say I’m 
on an Aimless Tramp. I’ve al- 
ways hoped that some day I 
might earn the right to a Free 
Choice.” 

“But you’re the Leader,” the 
girl said in astonishment. “You’re 
entitled to all the Free Choices 
you want!” 

He lifted his twitching head, 
smiling wanly. “It would seem 
that way, wouldn’t it? Well, 
whether I am or not, I think I’ve 
really earned a Free Choice. I 
wonder,” he said in a wistful 
voice, “whether the climate in 
the Andes is hospitable.”

Naturally, any sick person should be given 
medical help, even if he's from space. But 
what if he couM nof ever have been alive? 



I COLLAPSED joints and 
hung up to talk with 
Dak-whirr. He blinked his 
eyes iri some discomfort. 

“What do you want, Palil?” 
he asked complainingly. 

“As if you didn’t know.” 

“I can’t give you permission to 
examine it. The thing is being 



saved for inspection by the board. 
What guarantee do I have that 
you won’t spoil it for them?” 

I thrust confidentially at one 
of his body-plates. “Yoi^owe me 
a favor.” I said. “Remember?” 
“That was a long time in the 
past.”

tions and a reassembly ago. If it 
wasn’t for me, you’d be eroding 
in a pit. All 1 want is a quick 
look at its thinking part. I’ll vrull 
the consciousness without laying 
a single pair of pliers on it.” 

He went into a feedback twitch, 
an indication of the conflict be- 
tween his debt to me and his self- 
conceived duty. 

Finally he said, "Very well, 
but keep tuned to me. If I warn 
that a board member is coming, 
remove yourself quickly. Anyway 
how do you know it has con- 
sciousness? It may be mere primal 
metal.” 

*'In that form? Don’t be foolish. 
It’s obviously a manufacture. And 
I’m not conceited enough to hc- 
li«ve that we are the only form 
of intelligent manufacture in the 
Universe.” 

“Tautologous phrasing, Palil,” 
Dak-whirr said pedantically. 
"There could not conceivably be 
*unintelHgent manufacture.’ There 
can be no consciousness without 
manufacture, and no manufacture 
without intelligence. Therefore 
there can be no consciousness 
without intelligence. Now if you 
should wish to dispute — ” 

I tuned off his frequency 
abruptly and hurried away. Dak- 
whirr is a fool and a bore. Every- 
one knows there’s a fault in his 
logic circuit, but he refuses to 
have it traced down and repaired. 
Very unintelligent of him. 



thing had been taken into 
one of the museum sheds by 
the carriers. I gazed at it in ad- 
miration for some moments. It 
was quite beautiful, having suf- 
fered only slight exterior damage, 
and it was obviously no mere 
conglomeration of sky metal. 

In fact, I immediately thought 
of it as “he” and endowed it 
with the attributes of self-know- 
ing, although, of course, his con- 
sciousness could not be function- 
ing or he would have attempted 
communication with us. 

I fervently hoped that the 
board, after his careful disassem- 
bly and study, could restore his 
awareness so that he could tell 
us himself which solar system he 
came from. 

Imagine it! He had achieved 
our dream of many thousands of 
revolutions — space flight — only to 
be fused, or worse, in his mo- 
ment of triumph. 

I felt a surge of sympathy for 
the lonely traveler as he lay 
there, still, silent, non-emitting. 
Anyway, I mused, even if we 
couldn’t restore him to self- 
knowing, an analysis of his con- 
struction-.might give us the secret 
of the power he had used to 
achieve the velocity to escape his 
planet’s gravity. 

In shape and size he was not 
unlike Swen — or Swen Two, as 
he called himself after his con- 
version — who failed so disas-

tfously to reach our satellite, us- 
ing chemical fuels. But where 
Swen Two had placed his tubes, 
the stranger had a curious helical 
construction studded at irregular 
intervals with small crystals. 

He was thirty-five feet tall, a 
gracefully tapering cylinder. 
Standing at his head, I could find 
no sign of exterior vision cells, 
so 1 assumed he had some kind 
of vrulling sense. There seemed 
to be no exterior markings at all. 
except the long, shallow grooves 
dented in his skin by scraping to 
a stop along the hard surface of 
our planet. 

I am a reporter with warm cur- 
rent in my wires, not a cold- 
thinking scientist, so I hesitated 
before using my own vrulling 
sense. Even though the stranger 
was non-aware-:<-perhaps perma- 
nently— I felt it would be a pre- 
sumption. an invasion of privacy. 
There was nothing else I could 
do, though, of course. 

I started to vrull, gently at 
first, then harder, until I was 
positively glowing with effort. It 
was incredible; his skin seemed 
absolutely impermeable. 

The sudden realization that 
metal could be so alien nearly 
fused something inside me. I 
found myself backing away in 
horror, my self-preservation •re- 
lay working overtime. 

Imagine watching one of the 
beautiful cone-rod-and-cylinder 



assemblies performing the Dance 
of the Seven Spanners, as he's 
conditioned to do, and then sud- 
denly refusing to do anything ex- 
cept stump around unattractively, 
or even becoming obstinately mo- 
tionless, unresponsive. That might 
give you an idea of how I felt 
in that dreadful moment. 

Then I remembered Dak- 
whirr's words — there could be no 
such thing as an “unintelligent 
manufacture.” And a product so 
beautiful could surely not be evil. 
I overcame my repugnance and 
approached again. 

1 halted as an open transmis- 
sion came from someone near at 
hand. 

“Who gave that squeaking re- 
porter permission to snoop around 
here?” 

I had forgotten the museum 
board. Five of them were standing 
in the doorway of the shed, ra- 
diating anger. I recognized Chirik, 
the chairman, and addressed my- 
self to him. I explained that I'd 
interfered with nothing and 
pleaded for permission on behalf 
of my subscribers to watch their 
investigation of the stranger. 
After some argument, they al- 
lowed me to stay. 

I watched in silence and some 
amusement as one by one they 
tried to vrull the silent being from 
space. Each showed the same re- 
action as myself when they. failed 
to penetrate the skin.

Chirik, who is wheeled — and 
inordinately vain about his sus- 
pension system — flung himself 
back on his supports and pre- 
tended to be thinking. 

"Fetch FifT-fiff,” he said at last. 
"The creature may still be aware, 
but unable to communicate on 
our standard frequencies.’* 

I^IFF-FIFF can detect any- 
thing in any spectrum. For- 
tunately he was at work in the 
museum that day and soon ar- 
rived in answer to the call. He 
stood silently near the stranger 
for some moments, testing and 
adjusting himself, then slid up 
the electromagnetic band, 

‘‘He’s emitting,” he said. 

“Why can’t we get him?” asked 
Chirik. 

“It’s a curious signal on an un- 
usual band.” 

“Well, what does he say?’* 
“Sounds like utter nonsense to 
me. Wait, I’ll relay and convert 
it to standard.” 

I made a direct recording nat- 
u Hilly, like any good reporter.

couple of hours, but keeping this 
channel open and hoping ...” 
“The fall must have deranged 
him,” said Chirik, gazing at the 
stranger. “Can’t he see us or hear 
us?” 

“He couldn’t hear you properly 
before, but he can now, through 
me,” Fiff-fiff pointed out. “Say 
something to him, Chirik.” 

“Hello,” said Chirik doubt- 
fully. “Er — welcome to our planet. 
We arc sorry you were hurt by 
your fall. We offer you the hos- 
pitality of our assembly shops. 
You will feel better when you 
are repaired and repowered. If 
you will indicate how we can 
assist you — *’ 

“What the hell! What ship is 
that? Where arc you?” 

, “We’re here,” said Chirik. 
“Can’t you see us or vrull us? 
Your vision circuit is impaired, 
perhaps? Or do you depend en- 
tirely on vrulling? We can’t find 
your eyes and assumed cither 
that you protected them in some 
way during flight, or dispensed 
with vision cells altogether in 
your conversion.” 

Chirik hesitated, continued 
apologetically; “But we cannot 
understand how you vrull, either. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



While we thought that you were 
unaware, or even completely 
fused, we tried to vrull you. 
Your skin is quite impervious to 
us, however.” 

The stranger said: *T don’t 
know if you’re batty or I am. 
What distance are you from me?*’ 

Chirik measured quickly. "One 
meter, two-point-five centimeters 
from my eyes to your nearest 
point. Within touching distance, 
in fact.” Chirik tentatively put 
out his hand. “Can you not feel 
me, or has your contact sense 
also been affected?” 

It became obvious that the 
stranger had been pitifully de- 
ranged. 1 reproduce his words 
phonetically from my record, al- 
though some of them make little 
sense. Emphasis, punctuative 
pauses and spelling of unknown 
terms are mere guesswork, of 
course. 

He said: “For godsakemann 
stop talking nonsense, whoever 
you are. If you’re outside, can’t 
you see the airlock is jammed? 
Can’t shift it myself. I’m badly 
hurt. Get me out of here, please.” 

“Get you out of where?” Chirik 
looked around, puzzled. “We 
brought you into an open shed 
near our museum for a prelimi- 
nary examination. Now that we 
know you’re intelligent, we shall 
immediately take you to our 
assembly shops for healing and 
recuperation. Rest assured that 



you’ll have the best possible at- 
tention.” 

r^HERE was a lengthy pause 
before the stranger spoke 
again, and his words were slow 
and deliberate. His bewilderment 
is understandable, I believe, if we 
remember that he could not sec, 
vrull or feel. 

He asked: “What manner of 
creature are you? Describe your- 
self.” 

Chirik turned to us and made 
a significant gesture toward his 
thinking part, indicating gently 
that the injured stranger had to 
be humored. 

“Certainly,” he replied. “I am 
an unspecialized bipedal manu- 
facture of standard proportions, 
lately self-converted to wheeled 
traction, with a hydraulic sus- 
pension system of my own de- 
vising which I’m sure will interest 
you when we restore your sense 
circuits.” 

There was an even longer si- 
lence. 

“You are robots,” the stranger 
said at last. “Crise knows how 
you got here or why you speak 
Inglish, but you must try to un- 
derstand me. I am mann. I am 
a friend of your master, your 
maker. You must fetch him to me 
at once.” 

“You are not well,” said Chirik 
firmly. “Your speech is incoherfnt 
and without meaning. Your fall

ous feedbacks of a very serious 
nature. Please lower your voltage. 
We are taking you to our

‘‘Wait. You must understand.

“Out where?” asked Prrr-chuk, 
deputy chairman of the museum 
board. 

I shook my head sorrowfully. 
This was nonsense, but, like any 
good reporter, I kept my recorder 
running. 

The mad words flowed on. 
•*You call me he. Why? You have 
no seks. You are knewter. You are

planet, hearing goblin voices in 
the darkness.” 

H ere my recorder reproduces 
a most curious souiul. as 
though the stranger were using an 
ancient type of vibratory molec- 
ular vocalizer in a gaseous me- 
dium to reproduce his words 
before transmission, and the in- 
sulation on his diaphragm had 
come adrift. 

It was a jerky, high-pitched, 
strangely disturbing sotmd: but 
in a moment the fault was cor- 
rected and the stranger resumed 
transmission. 

“Does blud mean anything to 
you?” 

“No,” Chirik replied simply. 
“Or deth?” 

“No.”-. 

“Or wor?” 

“Quite meaningless.” 

“What is your origin? How did 
you come into being?” 

“There are several theories.” 
Chirik said. “The most popular 
one — which is no more than a 



SO 



• AlAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



grossly unscientific legend, in my 
opinion — is that our manufac- 
turer fell from the skies, imbed- 
ded in a mass of primal metal on 
which He drew to erect the first 
assembly shop. How He came 
into being is l^^t to conjecture. 
My own theory, however — ” 
“Does legend mention the shape 
of this primal metal?” 

“In vague terms, yes. It was 
cylindrical, of vast dimensions.” 
“An interstellar vessel,” said 
the stranger. 

"That is my view also,” said 
Chirik complacently. “And — ” 
“What was the supposed ap- 
pearance of your — manufac- 
turer?” 

“He is said to have been of 
magnificient proportions, based 
harmoniously on a cubical plan, 
static in Himself, but equipped 
with a vast array of senses.” 

“An. automatic computer,” said 
the stranger. 

He made more curious noises, 
less jerky and at a lower pitch 
than the previous sounds. 

He corrected the fault and went 
on: “God that’s funny. A ship 
falls, menn are no more, and an 
automatic computer has pupps. 
Oh, yes, it fits in. A self-setting 
computer and navigator, operat- 
ing on verbal orders. It learns to 
listen for itself and know itself 
for what it is, and to absorb 
knowledge. It comes to hate menn 
— or at least their bad qualities 



— so it deliberately crashes the 
ship and pulps their puny bodies 
with a calculated nicety of shock. 
Then it propagates and does a 
dam fine job of selective erasure 
on whatever it gave its pupps to 
use for a memory. It passes on 
only the good it found in menn, 
and purges the memory of him 
completely. Even purges all of 
his vocabulary except scientific 
terminology. Oil is thicker than 
blud. So may they live without 
the burden of knowing that they 
are — ogod they rhust know, 
they must understand. You out- 
side, what happened to this man- 
ufacturer?” 

Chirik, despite his professed 
disbelief in the supernormal as- 
pects of the ancient story, auto- 
matically made a visual sign of 
sorrow. 

“Legend has it,” he said, “that 
after completing His task. He 
fused himself beyond possibility 
of healing.” 

A BRUPT, low-pitched noises 
came again from the 
stranger. “Yes. He would. Just 
in case any of His pupps should 
give themselves forbidden know- 
ledge and an infeeryorrity kom- 
plecks by probing his mnemonic 
circuits. The perfect self-sacri-

Chirik looked around at us

again in bewilderment, but he 
replied courteously, giving the 
stranger a description of our 
world. 

“Of course.” said the stranger. 
“Of course. Sterile rock and metal 
suitable only for you. But there 
must be some way. .” 

He was silent for a while. 

“Do you know what growth 
means?” he asked finally. “Do 
you have anything that grows?” 
“Certainly,” Chirik said help- 
fully. “If we should suspend a 
crystal of some substance in a 
saturated solution of the same 
clement or compound — ” 

“No, no,” the stranger inter- 
rupted. “Have you nothing that 
grows of itself, that fruktiffies 
arM gives increase without your 
intervention?” 

“How could such a thing be?” 
“Criseallmytee I should have 
guessed. If you had one blade of 
gras, just one tiny blade of grow- 
ing gras, you could extrapolate 
from that to me. Green things, 
things that feed on the rich brest 
of erth, cells that divide and 
multiply, a cool grove of treez 
in a hot summer, with tiny warm- 
bludded burds preening their 
f ethers among the leeves; a feeld 
of spring weet with newbawn mise 
timidly threading the dangerous 
jungul of storks; a stream of 
living water where silver fish dart 
and pry and feed and procreate; a 
farm yard where things grunt and 



cluck and greet the new day with 
the stirring pulse of life, with a 
surge of blud. Blud — ” 

For some inexplicable reason, , 
although the strength of his 
carrier wave remained almost 
constant, the stranger’s transmis- 
sion seemed to be growing fainter. 

“His circuits are failing.” Chir- 
ik said. “Call the carriers. We 
must take him to an assembly 
shop immediately. I wish he 
would reserve his power.” 

My presence with the museum 
board was accepted without ques- 
tion now. I hurried along with 
them as the stranger was carried 
to the nearest shop. 

I now noticed a circular mark- 
ing in that part of his skin on 
which he had been resting, and 
guessed that it was some kind 
of orifice through which he would 
have extended his planetary trac- 
tion mechanism if he had not 
been injured. 

He was gently placed on a 
disassembly cradle. The doctor in 
charge that day was Chur-chur, 
an old friend of mine. He had 
been listening to the two-way 
transmissions and was already 
acquainted with the case. 

C HUR-CHUR walked thought- 
fully around the stranger. 

“We shall have to cut,” he said, 
“It won’t pain him, since hia 
intra -molecular pressure and con- 
tact senses have failed. But since 






GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



we can’t vrull him. it’ll be nec- 
essary for him to tell us where 
his main brain is housed or we 
might damage it.” 

Fiff-fiff was still relaying, But 
no amount of power boost would 
make the stranger’s voice any 
clearer. It was quite faint now, 
and there are places on my re- 
corder tape from which I cannot 
make even the roughest phonetic 
transliteration. 

“ . strength going. Can’t get 
into my zoot . done for if 
they bust through lock, done for 
if they don’t . must tell them 
I need oxygen . .” 

“He’s in bad shape, desirous of 
extinction,” 1 remarked to Chur- 
chur, who was adjusting his arc- 
cutter. “He wants to poison him- 
self with oxidation now.” 

I shuddered at the thought of 
that vile, corrosive gas he had 
mentioned, which causes that al- 
most unmentionable condition we 
all fear — rust. 

Chirik spoke firmly through 
Fiff-fiff. “Where is your thinking 
part, stranger? Your central 
brain?” 

“In my head,” the Stranger re- 
plied, “In my head ogod my 
head . , . eyes blurring every- 
thing going dim , , . luv to mairee 
. kids ... a carry me home to the 
lone prayree . get this bluddy 
airlock open then they’ll see me

some kind of atmosphere with 



this gravity . see me die . 
extrapolate from body what I 
was . what they are damthem 
damthem damthem . mann 
. master . i am your maker!” 

For a few seconds the voice rose 
strong and clear, then faded away 
again and dwindled into a com- 
bination of those two curious 
noises I mentioned earlier. For 
some reason that I cannot ex- 
plain, I found the combined sound 
very disturbing despite its faint- 
ness. It may be that it induced 
some kind of sympathetic oscil- 
lation. 

Then came words, largely in- 
coherent and punctuated by a 
kind of surge like the sonic vi- 
brations produced by variations 
of pressure in a leaking gas-filled 
vessel. 

“ . done it . crawling into 
chamber, closing inner . must 
be mad . , . they’d find me any- 
way . but finished . want sec 
them before I die . want see 
them see me . liv few seconds, 
watch them ... get outer one 
open ...” 

Chur-chur had adjusted his arc 
to a broad, clean, blue-white 
glare. I trembled a little as he 
brought it near the edge of the 
circular marking in the stranger’s 
skin. I could almost feel the dis- 
ruption of the intra-molecular 
sense currents in my own skin. 

“Don’t be squeamish, Palil,’* 
Chur-chur said kindly. “He can’t

feel it now that his contact sense 
has gone. And you heard him say 
that his central brain is in his 
head.” He brought the cutter 
firmly up to the skin. “I should 
have guessed that. He’s the same 
shape as Swen Two, and Swen 
very logically concentrated his 
main thinking part as far away 
from his explosion chambers as 
possible.” 

TJ IVULETS of metal ran down 
into a tray which a calm 
assistant had placed on the 
ground for that purpose. I averted 
my eyes quickly. I could never 
steel myself enough to be a sur- 
gical engineer or assembly tech- 
nician. 

But I had to Icx^ again, fasci- 
nated. The whole area circum- 
scribed by the marking was be- 
ginning to glow. 

Abruptly the stranger’s voice 
returned, quite strongly, each 
word clipp>ed, emphasi 2 ed, high- 
pitched. 

“Ar no no no . god ray hands 
. they’re burning through the 
lock and I can’t get back I can’t 
get away . stop it you feens 
slop it can’t you hear . I’ll 
be burned to deth I’m here in 
the airlock . the air’s getting 
hot you’re burning me alive ...” 

Although the words made little 
sense, I could guess what had 
happened and I was horrified. 

“Stop, Chur-chur,” 1 pleaded. 



“The heat has somehow brought 
back his skin currents. It’s hurt* 
ing him.” 

Chur-chur said reassuringly: 
“Sorry, Palil. It occasionally hap- 
pens during an operation — prob- 
ably a local thermo-electric ef- 
fect. But even if his contact senses 
have started working again and 
he can’t switch them off, he won’t 
have to bear this very long.” 

Chirik shared my unease, how- 
ever. He put out his hand and 
awkardly patted the stranger’s 
skin. 

“Easy there,” he said. “Cut out 
your senses if you can. If you 
can’t, well, the operation is nearly 
finished. Then we’ll repower you, 
and you’ll soon be fit and happy 
again, healed and fitted and re- 
assembled.” 

I decided that I liked Chirik 
very much just then. He exhibited 
almost as much self-induced em- 
pathy as any reporter; he might 
even come to like my favorite 
blue stars, despite his cold sci- 
entific exactitude in most respects. 

My recorder tape shows, in its 
reproduction of certain sounds, 
how I was tom away from this 
strained reverie. 

During the one-and-a-half sec- 
onds since I had recorded the 
distinct vocables “burning me 
alive,” the stranger’s words had 
become quite blurred, running to- 
gether and rising even higher in 
pitch until they reached a sus-

tained note — around E-flat in the 
standard sonic scale. 

It was not like a voice at all. 

This high, whining noise was 
suddenly modulated by apparent 
words, but without changing its 
pitch. Transcribing what seem to 
be words is almost impossible, as 
you can see for yourself — this is 
the closest I can come phoneti- 
cally: 

“Eeee ahahmbeeeeing baked 
aliiive in an uvennn ahdeeerjeee- 
sussunmuuutherrr !” 

The note swooped higher and 
higher until it must have neared 
supersonic range, almost beyond 
either my direct or recorded 
hearing. 

Then it stopped as quickly as a 
contact break. 

^nd although the soft hiss of 
the stranger’s carrier wave car- 
ried on without perceptible di- 
minution, indicating that some 
degree of awareness still existed, 
I experienced at that moment one 
of those quirks of intuition given 
only to reporters: 

I felt that I would never greet 
the beautiful stranger from the 
sky in his full senses. 

^HUR-CHUR was muttering 
to himself about the extreme 
toughness and thickness of the 
stranger’s skin. He had to make 
four complete cutting revolutions 
before the circular mass of nearly 
white-hot metal could be pulled 



away by a magnetic grapple. 

A billow of smoke puffed out 
of the orifice. Despite my repug- 
nance, I thought of my duty as 
a reporter and forced myself to 
look over Chur-chur’s shoulder. 

The fumes came from a soft, 
charred, curiously shaped mass 
of something which lay just inside 
the opening. 

“Undoubtedly a kind of insu- 
lating material,” Chur-chur ex- 
plained. 

He drew out the crumpled 
blackish heap and placed it care- 
fully on a tray. A small portion 
broke away, showing a red, viscid 
substance. 

“It looks complex,” Chur-chur 
said, “but I expect the stranger 
will be able fo tell us how to 
reconstitute it or make a sub- 
stitute.” 

His assistant gently cleaned the 
wound of the remainder of the 
material, which he placed with 
the rest; and Chur-chur resumed 
his inspection of the orifice. 

You can, if you want, read the 
technical accounts of Chur-chur’s 
discovery of the stranger’s double 
skin at the point where the cut 
was made; of the incredible com- 
plexity of his driving mechanism, 
involving principles which are 
still not understood to this day; 
of the museum’s failure to an- 
alyze the exact nature and func- 
tion of the insulating material 
found in only that one portion 



56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of his body: and of the other 
scientific mysteries connected 
with him. 

But this is my personal, non- 
scientific account. I shall never 
forget hearing about the greatest 
mystery of all, for which not even 
the most tentative explanation 
has been advanced, nor the utter 
bewilderment with which Chur- 
chur announced his initial find- 
ings that day. 

He had hurriedly converted 
himself to a convenient size to 
permit actual entry into the 
stranger’s body. 

When he emerged, he stood in 
silence for several minutes. Then, 
very slowly, he said: 

“I have examined the ‘central 
brain’ in the forepart of his 
body. It is no more than a simple 
auxiliary computer mechanism. 
It does not possess the slightest 
trace of consciousness. And there 
is no other conceivable center of 
intelligence in the remainder of 
his body.” 

There is something I wish I 
could forget. I can’t explain why 
it should upset me so much. But 
I always stop the tape before 
it reaches the point where the 
voice of the stranger rises in pitch, 
going higher and higher until it 
cuts out. 

There’s a quality about that 
noise that makes me tremble and 
think of rust.

By CHARUS DE VH 

Never ask "'Who am I and where 
do I come from?'' The answers 
may not be what you'd expect/ 



Ilivsfrated by DON SIBLEY 



T HEN did the hcad- 
aches first start?” 
Y Y asked the neurolo- 
gist, Dr. Hall. 

“About six months ago,” Ben- 
nett replied. 

‘What is your occupation, Mr. 
Bennett?” 

“I am a contractor.” 

•*Arc you happy in your work?” 
“Very. I prefer it to any other 
occupation I know of.” 

“When your headaches become 
sufficiently severe, you say that 
you have hallucinations,” HgU 



said. “Can you describe what 
you see during those hallucina- 
tions?” 

“At first I had only the im- 
pression that I was in a place 
completely unlike anything I had 
ever known,” Bennett answered. 
“But each time my impressions 
became sharper, and I carried 
a fairly clear picture when my 
mind returned to normal the last 
time. I felt then that I had been 
in a room in a tall building that 
towered thousands of feet over a 
great city. I even remembered 



SB 



6AIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that the name of the city was 
Thone. There were other people 
in the room with me— one person 
especially. I remembered her very 
clearly.” 

“Her?” Hall asked. 

“Yes.” 

‘‘Was there anything unusual 
about this woman?” 

“Well, yes, there was,” Bennett 
said, after a brief and almost 
embarrassed pause. “This will 
sound pretty adolescent, but — ” 
Hall leaned forward attentively. 
“It may be relevant. You’re not 
here to be judged, you know; I’m 
trying to help you.” 

Bennett nodded and spoke 
rapidly, as though trying to fin- 
ish before he could stop himself. 
“Siie was a woman who exactly 
fitted an image I’ve had in mind 
for as long as I can remember. 
She was tall, fair — though bru- 
nette — very beautiful, very vivid, 
very well poised. I seem to have 
known her all my life, but only 
in my dreams, from my very 
earliest ones to the present. She’s 
never changed in all that time.” 
He halted as suddenly as he 
had begun to talk, either having 
nothing more to say, or unwilling 
to say it. 

“Have you ever married. Mr. 
Bennett?” Hall prodded gently. 

“No. I never have.” Again, 
Bennett stopped, adding nothing 
more to his blunt answer. 

“May I ask why not?” 



Bennett turned his face away. 
“I was hoping you wouldn’t ask 
that. It makes me sound like a 
romantic kid.” He looked at the 
doctor almost in defiance. “I’ve 
always felt that some day I would 
meet this girl, or at least someone 
very much like her. I know it’s 
not a rational feeling — maybe I’ve 
even used it as an excuse not 
to get married — but it’s like spill- 
ing salt and throwing a pinch 
over our shoulder; we aren't 
superstitious, yet we don’t take 
any chances.” 

Dr. Hall didn't comment. He 
ended the questioning period and 
put Bennett through a series of 
tests. Then they sat down again 
and Hall offered his diagnosis. 

“The neurological examiitation 
is essentially negative, Mr. Ben- 
nett. In other words, there is no 
organic reason that I can find 
for your headaches. That leaves 
only one other possibility — an 
emotional disturbance. I'm a 
neurologist, remember, not a psy- 
choanalyst. I can only give an 
opinion about the cause of your 
complaint.” 

Bennett waited expectantly, 

“Headaches without organic 
causes are generally the result of 
repressed anger,” Hall went on. 
“That anger can stem from any 
number of traumatic situations 
or attitudes, all deeply buried in 
the unconscious, of course, or 
they would not have the power

Sf 



to hurt US- From what we know 
of you, however, it seems to be 
the result of frustration. In other 
words, you have created a fantasy 
image of a completely unattain- 
able woman, and therefore none 
of the women you meet can ful- 
fill your expectations. Sin^e she 
is unattainable, you naturally feel 
a sense of frustration.” 

“But who could she be?” Ben- 
nett asked anxiously. 

“Someone you knew in child- 
hood, perhaps. A composite of 
real and imaginary women. Usu- 
ally, it is an idealized image of 
your own mother.” 

Bennett sat frowning. “All 
right, let’s say that’s so. But 
where do the hallucinations of 
th« city of Thone fit in?” 

“This is something that has 
to be tracked down in a series of 
analytical sessions, so all 1 can 
do is guess. If one is unable to 
reach a goal in a real environ- 
ment. the obvious answer is to 
create a fantasy world. That’s 
what you appear to be doing, It’s 
a dangerous situation. Mr. Ben- 
nett. Potentially, at least.” 

“How so?” Bennett asked, 
alarmed. 

“The general tendency is to- 
ward greater and greater divorce- 
ment from reality. I suggest 
immediate treatment by a com- 
petent analyst. If you don’t know 
of one, I can recommend several.” 
“I’d like to think it over.” 



“Do that.” Hall said. “And 
call me when you’ve decided.” 

T he third day after he con- 
sulted the neurologist, Ben- 
nett’s headache returned. As be- 
fore, drugs were of no help. Wlicn 
the pain became blinding, he lay 
back on his bed, placed a cold 
cloth on his forehead, and closed 
his eyes. 

Suddenly the realities he knew 
were gone and he was back in 
the dream-city of Thone. 

Persons and objects were much 
clearer now. Bennett sa.w that he 
lay in a receptacle shaped like a 
rectangular metal box. It was 
padded, reminding him unpleas- 
antly of a coffin. The woman he 
had seen before was again with 
him, but now he knew that her 
name was Lima. Behind her 
stood a man; a tall, dark man 
whose eyebrows joined over the 
bridge of his nose, and whose 
forehead was creased in a per- 
manent frown. The woman held 
out her arms to Bennett. Her lips 
moved, but no sound came from 
them. 

Bennett’s spirit seemed to rise 
from the. flesh — he could see his 
body still lying there — and he 
followed the woman. As he ap- 
proached she retreated and. try 
as he would to reach her, she re- 
mained just beyond his grasp. 

After what seemed hours of 
futile pursuit, a cloud formed be- 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tween him and the woman. When 
it dissipated, he had left the 
world of Thone. He was in a 
trolley-bus, in his own world, and 
vaguely he recalled having left 
his room, gone down to the street, 
and board(jd the trolley— during 
the time he had followed Lima, 
in his hallucination. It seemed 
that he had a definite destination 
then, but now he could not recall 
what it had been. 

His attention was drawn to the 
outside by the flickering of lights 
that flashed in through the bus 
windows. Bennett looked out and 
saw that he was in the Pleasure 
Section of the city, traveling 
through the Street of Carnivals. 
He watched the fronts of the 
amusement buildings pass before 
him and he read their advertise- 
ments listlessly. 

Suddenly one sign seemed to 
spring out from all the others: 

LIMA 

MYSTIC OF THE MIND 

He left the trolley at the next 
corner and made his way through 
the crowd to the brightly lit car- 
nival building. 

Inside, he found a chair and 
seated himself. The show’s act 
appeared about half over. It was 
pretty evidently charlatan stuff, 
Bennett decided, -but the black- 
hooded mystic on the stage held 
his attention. She was a tall 



woman, with a slender figure and 
fair flesh. She was poised, or per- 
haps it was indifference to the 
crowd. 

A runner went through the au- 
dience touching articles of cloth- 
ing or ornaments, and the woman 
without hesitation named each 
one he touched. The act was 
slightly different from most Ben- 
nett had seen in that the runner 
said nothing, merely touching the 
articles to be named. 

The next portion of the show 
consisted of a mind-reading act. 
Bennett expeicted the usual rou- 
tine of writing a question on 
paper, which would be sealed in 
an envelope and placed in a con- 
tainer on the stage. 

He was surprised when the 
runner returned to the crowd and 
asked for volunteers for thought- 
reading. 

A shor^* man with a bright 
yellow necktie raised his hand. 
The runner made his way through 
the crowd to the man and touched 
him on the shoulder before turn- 
ing back to the mystic. He still 
said nothing. 

“This man is thinking that he 
should have stayed at home to- 
night,” the mystic said. “There 
are wrestling matches on the tele- 
tone. and he would have enjoyed 
them more than this show. Be- 
sides, he would have spent less 
money that way than he has 
tonight. And he does not like to

*pcnd money unless he must.** 

A titter of amusement went 
through the crowd as the man 
blushed a dull crimson. 

The runner touched a second 
man. 

“This man wishes to know the 
winner in the eighth race at the 
horse tracks tomorrow,” she said. 
“I am sorry, but. because of Pub- 
lic Law one thousand thirty-two, 
Section' five-A, I am prohibited 
from answering a question of 
that nature.” 

The third person contacted was 
a woman. She raised her hand, 
then half changed her mind when 
she saw that the runner was 
turning toward her. But then she 
defiantly tossed her brown hair 
ba«k from her face and allowed 
him to touch her shoulder. 

"This woman is wondering if 
her lover is true to her — and if 
her husband will find out about 
them.” 

This time the crowd laughed 
when the embarrassed woman 
turned pale and rushed up the 
aisle toward the exit. 

No further hands were raised 
and the show ended with a short 
address by the runner: "I hope 
you have enjoyed these truly mar- 
velous and mysterious demon- 
strations. Now the mystic, Lima, 
is available for a short time for 
personal interviews. The fee is 
very reasonable — one dollar a 
minute. Anyone wishjng an inter- 



view please step forward.** 

The mystic pulled the hood 
from her head, smiled, bowed at 
the crowd, and left the stage. 
Bennett gasped. 

"The Avoman of the city of 
Thone!” 

"■^7'OU have paid in advance for 
twenty-five minutes of my 
time.” Lima said, as she smiled in 
amusement. "Perhaps you had 
better begin your questions, in- 
stead of merely staring at me.** 
Bennett brought his thoughts 
back with an effort. "Your 
performance was exceptionally 
good,” he said very soberly. “I 
enjoyed it. And so, apparently 
did the other customers. It is a 
clever routine. I'll admit I an’t 
figure out how you do it.^ 
“Remember what Barnum said,** 
Lima replied lightly. 

"At least you do not take your- 
self too seriously,” Bennett ob- 
served. 

"On the contrary,” Lima coun- 
tered, *T take myself very seri- 
ously. You, however, do not. You 
are paying for my time and the 
customer is always right." 

"Tell me,” Bennett asked 
abruptly, "have we ever met be- 
fore?” 

“Not to my knowledge.” 
"Have you any objections to 
telling me about yourself during 
our interview? Who are you? 
What is your background?”

“I will be glad to tell you about 
myself, if you think it will be 
interesting,” she replied, after a 
barely perceptible pause. “How I 
came by this exceptional ability 
of mine, I have no slightest con- 
ception. I only remember that 
when I was young, and still with- 
out the intellect to evaluate social 
mores and customs, I was often 
placed in positions of awkward- 
ness by my ability to read minds. 
At an early age, however, through 
the council of my parents, I 
learned to keep this knowledge to 
myself. 

“By the time I reached my 
twentieth birthday, my parents 
were both dead and I was alone 
in the world. I had never learned 
any occupation. I made some at- 
tempts to use my mind -reading 
to some advantage to myself, but 
soon found that I encountered 
the opposition of the medical as- 
sociations as well as the law. As 
a consequence, I turned to show 
business as the one means of 
earning a legitimate livelihood. 
There is not much more to tell.” 

“Can you actually read 
minds?” Bennett asked insistently. 

“I can.” 

“Then what am I thinking 
now?” 

“You are thinking,” Lima said, 
with no semblance of a trance 
or any of the other usual antics 
of professional mystics, “that I 
look exactly like a woman you 



have never seen, but whose image 
you have carried in your mind 
since your childhood.” 

For just a moment, the star- 
tling accuracy disconcerted Ben- 
nett. 

“I have a problem which is 
quite annoying,” he pushed on 
almost frantically. “Can you tell 
me what my problem is?” 

“You have been subject to ex- 
tremely severe headaches, which 
you have been unable to remedy, 
either by sedatives or with the 
help of a neurologist. Am I cor- 
rect?” 

“More than you could possibly 
know! Look, I came here believ- 
ing you were a fake. That didn’t 
matter — it was the fact that you 
looked like this other woman that 
counted. I’m convinced now. I 
want your help. Can you help me, 
or at least tell me whether the 
neurologist is right about the 
cause of my headaches?” 

“He is wrong,” Lima said. “I 
can tell you what causes them, 
but I am afraid that I will have 
to ask for another hundred dol- 
lars for that extra service.” 
Bennett was momentarily irri- 
tated at this evidence that their 
relationship, at least as far as she 
was concerned, was strictly busi- 
ness. But he shrugged off the 
feeling. He drew five twenty- 
dollar bills from his pocketbook 
and placed them on the table be- 
fore her.

“If you remember,** Lima said, 
folding the money carefully and 
tucking it into the neck of her 
dress, “five months ago a build- 
ing which you had contracted to 
build fell, when it was nearly 
completed, and two workmen 
were killed.’* 

*‘I remember very well.*’ 

“You found that the collapse 
of the building was caused by 
faulty material which you had 
bought through a subcontractor. 
You are still investigating to de- 
termine where to place the blame, 
and are on the point of doing so.” 
“Go on,” Bennett breathed 
softly. 

“You are quite certain that the 
person responsible is John Tour- 
najk ostensibly a reputable 
contractor, but actually an un- 
scrupulous scoundrel. You have 
a choice of exposing him, with 
great personal danger to yourself 
— Toumay is a dangerous and 
ruthless man — or remaining silent 
and knowing that you arc a 
coward. The difficulty of that 
choice is causing your head- 
aches.** 

“You may be right,” Bennett 
admitted without hesitation. “I 
haven’t had time to think the 
matter through quite that far. 
What would you advise me to 
do?” 

“That is something which can- 
not be advised. The answer lies 
within yourself. You arc either 



a big enough man to do the right 
thing — which you yourself rec- 
ognize— or you are a small man 
and will take the safer, less hon- 
orable course. The decision and 
the integrity lie within yourself.” 

B ennett slumped. *t sec 

that. Then there’s nothing 
more that you can do for me?” 
“But there is,” Lima replied. “I 
can cure your headaches, if you 
wish — for an additional hundred 
dollars.” 

“That would be a cheap price.” 
Bennett drew his wallet from his 
pocket. “My cash is rather low. 
Would you accept a personal 
check?” 

"Certainly,” Lima said. “But, 
first, let me explain about my 
cure. There is some mental un- 
pleasantness involved which you 
may consider worse than the ail- 
ment.” 

“I doubt that. I. can’t imagine 
anything worse than this agony.” 
“Your mind will be placed un- 
der my control and led through 
a dream sequence. I will follow 
a logical progression of events, 
using your actual past as back- 
ground. While you are under my 
control, your experiences will be 
far from pleasant. I will allow 
your mind to follow its own an- 
ticipated course of events, influ- 
encing your thoughts only slightly 
— directing them into as un- 
pleasant channels as possible. In 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



fact, to make the cure certain, 
at least the culmination must be 
quite devastating. Do you agree 
to undergo such rigorous mental 
punishment?” 

“But why do I have to?” Ben- 
nett *asked, astonished and wor- 
ried. 

‘‘That pattern will act in the 
manner of a counter-irritant. 
Your mind is like a spoiled child, 
rejecting anticipated unpleasant- 
ness. Under my influence it is 
rubjected to possible alternative 
experiences, which arc so much 
worse than the one it originally 
feared that it will gratefully ac- 
cept the lesser evil.” 

“That sounds reasonable,** 
Bennett agreed. “When could we 
begin this treatment?” 

“Immediately, if you arc will- 
ing.” 

“I see no reason for waiting.” 

“Then, if you are ready,” Lima 
told him, “lie on this couch. Keep 
your eyes on mine.” She spoke 
slowly, evenly. “Remember that 
you are doing this of your own 
free will, that you trust me. 1 
am your friend and would do you 
no harm.” 

Her voice droned on as Bennett 
looked into her eyes. They 
merged until they became one 
large, placid pool of restfulness, 
and he found himself drawn into 
them. 

He sank peacefully, quietly— 
completely. 



W HEN the telephone rang, 
Bennett knew it was the dis- 
trict attorney returning his call, 
and that the die was cast. Until 
this ugly business was brought to 
a conclusion, his life would be in 
constant danger. 

“Leroy Bennett speaking,” he 
said. “1 have had collected some 
information that I think will be 
of very great interest to your 
office.” 

“Information about what?” the 
voice at the other end asked 
briskly. 

“I have proof that John Tour- 
nay is responsible for the death 
of two men. in an action involv- 
ing criminal collusion.” 

“If what you say is true, I 
will be glad to see your evidence,” 
the district attorney said. “CouM 
you deliver it in person? There 
may be some questions I would 
like to ask you about it.” 

“Certainly,” Bennett replied, 
"When would be the most con- 
venient time?” 

“Later in the day. I have a 
case going on. How would four- 
thirty this afternoon suit you?” 
“That would be fine.” 

The rest of the day dragged 
slowly. At four o’clock Bennett 
left his office and took the ele- 
vator to the ground floor. Under 
his arm he clutched the briefcase 
which might spell death for him. 

A moment after he left his of- 
fice building, he knew be had

made a mistake — a fatal one! 

Idly, at first, his mind's eye 
watched the driver of a long gray 
acdan, parked at the curb, start 
Up its motor as he approached. 
The car pulled away from the 
curb when he came alongside it. 

Through an open rear window, 
Bennett saw a man with a dark, 
brooding face — with black eye- 
brows that joined over the bridge 
of the nose — glowering at him. At 
the same instant he saw the blunt 
nose of an automatic resting on 
the lowered glass of the window, 
just below the chin of the frown- 
ing man. 

Incredibly, even as he realized 
that he was about to die, Ben- 
ner's first thought was not one 
of Tear, but rather that this dark 
man was the other person he had 
seen in his hallucinations of the 
city of Thone! 

Then, as one part of his mind 
drew back in terror at what it 
knew was about to happen, an- 
other part wondered at the mys- 
tery of Thone and the people in 
it. Where did that hallucination 
fit in this mist of life which was 
about to ecid? 

He felt three hard, solid blows 
punch shockingly into his body. 
There was pain, but greater thari 
that was the terror that whipped 
his panicked mind. 

“Lima.” Bennett whispered 
with his last stark thought as he 
dropped to his knees. 



He groped for the sidewalk 
with one hand, to steady himself, 
and never reached it. 

“TT’S over now,” Bennett heard 
the mystic say. ‘‘Please try 
to relax.” 

He found himself fighting with 
awful exertion to raise himself 
from the sidewalk — which had 
turned into a couch. His clothes 
clung to him with a clammy wet- 
ness that chilled him. 

He flung his arms out in a 
frantic gesture that knocked a 
lamp from an end-table and sent 
it crashing to the floor. 

Not until then did he feel the • 
mystic’s firmly gentle hands on 
his shoulders, urging him down, 
and know that he was not actu- 
ally dying. He lay back for a 
moment, gasping great gulps of 
welcome air into his lungs. 

“I think you will be all right 
now.” Lima said. 

“You were right when you said 
the experience would not be 
pleasant,” Bennett said, still bat- 
tling for breath. “I hope the re- 
sults will be worth it.” 

“I believe you will find that 
they are,” Lima told him reassur- 
ingly. “Also, it can be of assist- 
ance to you in still another way. 
The sequence your dream fol- 
lowed— *being a natural, perhaps 
even a probable, aftermath of 
your past decisions and move- 
ments — could actually happen. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Therefore it would be wise to 
avoid such decisions in real life." 

A T the end of two weeks, Ben- 
nett had collected all the 
information he needed on Tour- 
nay’s illegal activities. The inves- 
tigator he hired was very 
thorough, and unearthed several 
other incriminating schemes in 
Tournay’s past. With the 'evidence 
he had on hand, Bennett was cer- 
tain that Tournay would be con- 
victed in any court. 

This time he intended to evade 
the fate he had suffered in the 
dream by acting differently. He 
hired a shrewd lawyer — the best 
obtainable — had him draw up 
the evidence in legal form, and 
presented it to the district at- 
torney, with the demand for 
Tournay’s immediate arrest. He 
knew that immediate action 
would be his best protection. 

That evening, when he left his 
office building, he felt the peace 
of a man whose task has been 
well done. 

It took almost a full second be- 
fore the sight of the long gray 
car jerked his thoughts from their 
pleasant introspection and back 
to dread reality. Tournay’s black- 
browed face leered at him as it 
had in the dream and he felt 
his body tense as it waited for 
the pistol slugs to strike. 

His mind scurried in its trap 
within his head and, strangely, 



it turned to the mystic for help. 

"Lima!" he called desperately. 

A GAIN Bennett felt himself 
** struggling with that awful 
exertion to drag his body from 
the couch on which it lay. 

"It’s all over now,” he heard 
Lima say. 

He sat up. "What happened?** 

"This will be hard to believe," 
Lima said, "and I will not try to 
prove it to you, but it is true. The 
mind has many powers which 
cannot even be imagined by any- 
one*who has not lived with those 
powers as I have. When you 
called me. your mind attuned it- 
self with mine, and its need and 
its demand were so powerful that 
together wc turned time back- 
ward. You are now back in my 
dressing room, and it is the exact 
time at which you originally 
came out of your dream." 

"That’s impossible!” Bennett 
protested. 

"Nevertheless, it happened. I 
only ask you to keep in mind one 
thing. Someday, when your mind 
has been made more facile, you 
will understand how I am able 
to do this. It will even appear 
logical to you. Now, however, 
the only thing I can tell you is 
believe it!*' 

T>BNNETT had no intention of 
muffing this second chance. 
After he had collected the infor- 



WHEilS WITHIN 



A7 



mation about Toumay’s criminal 
activities, he also dug into his 
past for a man who had cause to 
hate the contractor. He found the 
man he sought, a man as ruth- 
less and unscrupulous as Tournay 
himself, one who could fight him 
on his own ground. 

Roger Clarkson had been the 
controller of a string of bookie 
joints, before he had been framed 
by Toumay, and convicted, to 
serve ten years in prison. 

Clarkson had been released 
from prison six days before. He 
found that Toumay had gained 
control of his former criminal em> 
pire. Everyone, including Tour- 
nay, knew that the only thing 
preventing Clarkson from taking 
rc^^ngc was the opportunity. 

Bennett sent his information to 
Clarkson and sat back to await 
the results. That evening, as he 
was about to leave his office 
building, some inner caution 
warned him to take no chances. 
He stepped cautiously out into 
the street, looked both ways for 
the gray sedan, and saw that the 
street was empty, before he 
walked to the corner. 

He arrived there just in time 
to meet the long gray sedan as it 
drpvc ut>. 

O NCE more he fought the aw- 
ful exertion on the mystic’s 
couch. This time he came out of 
the blackness with his mind clear. 



*^You’ve saved me again,” he said 
to Lima. “Have you turned time 
backward again?” 

“Yes,” she replied. ‘‘But I have 
given you all the help I can. The 
next attempt you rr^ke, you will 
have nothing on which to lean 
except your own strength.” 

“But why do I always arrive 
at the point where I’m being shot 
by Tournay, regardless of what 
course I choose? Is there no way 
I can beat him?” 

“If you believe in fate as 
strongly as I do, you will accept 
that conclusion as inevitable. The 
long gray sedan is the symbol of 
your death. You cannot avoid it 
— at least not as long as you per- 
sist in passive action.” 

“What do you mean by that?” 
“Just this. You wish to sec 
Tournay punished — your sense of 
justice demands it. But each time 
you try to have someone else ad- 
minister that punishment. It 
appears to me that the only 
possibility of your breaking this 
fateful progression of events is 
for you to administer the punish- 
ment yourself. You probably re- 
alize the danger of trying that. 
But I can’t see where you have 
any other choice.” 

“In other words, you feel that 
the only chance I have of pre- 
venting Tournay from killing me 
—is to kilt him first?” 

“Yes,” Lima said. “Are you 
strong and hard enough to do it?” 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Bennett thought for only a 
brief moment before he nodded. 
“I’m desperate enough, at any 
rate.” 

This time he did not leave im- 
mediately. He had to find out 
something first. He put his arms 
around Lima’s shoulders and 
drew her toward him. She put 
her face up and he kissed her 
waiting lips. They were sweet 
and. if she did not return the ar- 
dor of his kiss, he did not no- 
tice it. 

Tournay is not in.” the 
girl at the desk told Ben- 
nett. “You might try his home.” 

At a pay-booth in the lobby, 
Bennett called Tournay’s home. 
The voice that answered was that 
of a tired woman, one who has 
given up hope. “Mr. Tournay 
called me a short time ago and 
said that he would be in the 
office of a Mr. Leroy Bennett, in 
the Lowry building, if anyone 
called,” the tired voice said. 

Bennett hung up and caught 
a cab. His tjuatty had walked 
into an ideal place for their meet- 
ing. For better or for worse, he 
would soon bring this conflict to 
an end. 

In his office. Bennett found that 
Tournay had been there and gone. 
He had left a message: “Tell 
Mr. Bennett that Lima sent me!” 

So that was it — Lima had used 
Bennett as a dupe! He could not 



figure out her purpose, but he 
knew that he could never trust 
her again. She had been against 
him from the first. Perhaps even 
she, rather than Tournay, was the 
prime menace. He decided that 
he must kill them botli, before 
they had the chance to kill him. 
Touching the small flat pistol 
snuggling in its shoulder holster, 
he knew the pursuit must con- 
tinue immediately. 

He rode the elevator to the 
ground floor, and he felt his mind 
working with a clarity and a 
precision which he had seldom 
experienced before. This time he 
knew he would win. 

Shrewdly, before leaving the 
building. Bennett looked out 
through the glass pane in the 
door first. He waited only a mo- 
ment before he saw the long 
gray sedan as he had expected. 
They would not trap him again. 
Ducking back, he walked rapidly 
toward a side exit. 

Night had fallen by the time 
he reached the carnival building. 
He did not ring the bell. In- 
stead, he walked to the rear, 
climbed the stairs of a fire-escape, 
and softly opened the window of 
a bedroom. 

He stepped inside just as softly 
and stood listening for breathing. 
He heard none. This was prob- 
ably too early for Lima to be in 
bed. 

The bedroom door was open.

Bennett could sec a light coming 
from another part of the apart- 
ment — probably the living room. 
He paused to steel himself for 
what he must do. The time had 
come when he would have to be 
savagely ruthless. 

He found Lima sitting on a 
couch, reading a book. He sus- 
pected that she still had some 
control over his mind and he had 
no intention of letting her influ- 
ence him. She must be killed be- 
fore she could read hjs intention. 

“It didn’t work.” Bennett spoke 
just loudly enough to startle 
Lima into raising her head. 

As she looked up. he shot her 
squarely between the eyes. 

In an agony of frustration, 
Beiwett saw the flesh of her fore- 
head remain clear and undis- 
turbed. He knew he could not 
miss at this range, yet she was 
unhurt. He lowered his sights and 
shot at the white neck beneath 
the fair head. She still sat there, 
returning his gaze, unperturbed, 
unmarked by the bullets. 

He pumped the four remaining 
bullets into her body. The only 
part of her that moved was her 
lips. 

“It’s no use. Leroy.” she said. 
“Haven’t you guessed? You arc 
still in your dream. You can’t 
kill me there.” 

Suddenly the implication struck 
him with its awful simplicity. 

“Good God!” His voice rose. 



“Do you mean I've never been 
out of my dream?” He hesitated 
while the thought sank in. “My 
remembrance of coming out of 
it was only part of the dream it- 
self,” he murmured. “That was 
why you were able to turn time 
backward at will.” 

A cold calmness returned to 
him. 

“Tell me,” he said, “am I still 
in the dream?” 

“Yes,” Lima replied. 

“Then I demand that you free 
me now!” 

“As you wish,” Lima said 
sadly. “And may God help you.” 

Bennett wrenched his body 
from the couch on which it lay 
and struggled to his feet. Though 
the dream had seemed real 
enough, he could look back on 
it now and see it as any other 
dream. 

He breathed easier, and then 
stopped abruptly when he heard 
a voice behind him say, “You 
are still a dead man!” 

Bennett whirled and found 
himself facing Tournay. And 
Tournay held a pistol aimed at 
his heart. 

Bennett turned desperately back 
to Lima. His lips formed her 
name, but the sound died almost 
before it was uttered. This time, 
he saw, she would not help him. 
Her features had hardened and 
no mercy or compassion regis- 
tered on them.

“There is no escape,” she said. 

A fleeting thought went through 
his mind of springing at Tour- 
nay and trying to reach him be- 
fore the gun could be fired. But 
one glance at Tournay’s face 
made him realize how futile — and 
fatal — that would be. 

Tournay’s finger tightened on 
the trigger of his gun and Bennett 
thought ahead in despair to what 
was to come. One thing he knew: 
He did not want to die! Was 
there no way out? 

The answer came like a cry of 
re'ief. There was a way — Thone! 
The city of his enigma. Tournay 
an 1 Lima could not harm him 
there. 

F or just an instant, Bennett’s 
vision blurred. Time paused, 
and the next moment he knew 
he had returned to Thone. The 
sounds of the alien city floated 
up to him and he stirred. 

He grasped the sides of his 
coffinlike bed with fingers that 
had lost their sense of touch. He 
pulled himself up to a sitting po- 
sition and looked about him. On 
one side stood Lima, though now 
her features were not thc^e of 
the implacable, merciless mystic, 
but rather those of a woman in 
love. 

She smiled happily and said, 
“At last you have returned.” 
Bennett strove to move his 
tongue and lips to ask questions. 



but they refused, as though 
numbed by long inaction. He 
turned to his other side and gazed 
questioningly at the replica of 
Tournay who stood there. 

Tournay’s image spoke. “We 
had quite a time bringing you 
back. Sire. But now it has been 
accomplished — for good.” 

Striving to move his throat 
muscles, Bennett finally forced 
a sound, and then words, through 
his lips. 

“Tell me,” he pleaded. “Who 
are you? And, more important, 
who am I?” 

He turned to Lima for an an- 
swer, realizing that now she 
would help him if anyone would. 

“Doctor Tournay will explain 
it to you,” Lima replied, indi- 
cating the dark man. 

Imploringly, Bennett turned 
back to face Tournay. 

“I see that very little of your 
memory has returned yet,” Tour- 
nay said. “In a short while, ev- 
erything — all your past — will 
come back to you. Until then, 
perhaps I had better explain to 
you who you are. My words will 
help trigger your returning mem- 
ory, and speed up the process.” 

“Please’ do,” Bennett begged. 

“You are Benn Ett, Le Roy of 
the city-state of Thone, in the 
year 4526 A. D. Six months ago, 
the strain of governing the city 
began to undermine your health. 
Acting under my advice, you de- 



n 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



cided to take a somno-rest cure. 

“This rest cure,” the doctor 
continued, “is quite standard 
practice in. our time. We had a 
little difficulty bringing you out 
of it at the end of six months. 
Evidently your somno-existence 
must have been very pleasant.” 

“Do you mean that the exist- 
ence I remember was merely an 
induced figment of my imagina- 
tion?” 

“Yes. You see, the best rest 
that can be given a mind is to 
give it not sleep, but pleasant 
work. Therefore, under my ma- 
nipulation, you were given a 
pseudo-existence in a past era of 
history. You were led to copceive 
yourself as occupying a posi- 
tion, which, after close study, I 
deduced would be the most suit- 
able and relaxing for you.” 

“But if that is true, why did 
my dream have to end so un- 
pleasantly — I might say, so 
nearly fatally?” Bennett de- 
manded. 

“The more successful I am in 
choosing a pleasant existence for 
a patient in the somno, the more 
difficult it is to bring him out of 
it,” the doctor replied. “Your un- 
conscious mind, realizing how 
happy you were in your simu- 
lated existence, and how it would 
have to return to the rigor and 



stress which unnerved it before, 
fought with all its strength to re- 
main where the somno had placed 
it. 

“The usual practice in bring- 
ing a patient back to reality is 
for the doctor to enter the dream 
and convince him, by whatever 
means may be necessary, to re- 
turn. Sometimes, however, the 
patient is so firmly tied to 
his somno-existence that drastic 
measures must be used. This is 
usually done by means of making 
the somno-existence so anxiety- 
producing that the patient is glad 
to return. 

“Your particular release was 
one of the most difficult that I 
have ever encountered. In fact, I 
was unable to bring you back 
myself, and asked your wife, 
Lima, to enter the somno with me 
and help force you to return.” 

Bits of recollection, which had 
been edging into Bennett’s mem- 
ory, burst through' in full force, 
and he remembered. It was true. 
He was Benn Ett, Le Roy of the 
city-state of Thone. 

He turned to Lima and, as he 
read the glad light in her eyes, 
he knew that she had witnessed 
the return of his complete mem- 
ory. 

“Welcome home.” she said.

when you're near me 



By RICHARD MATHESON 

T he silvery ship came rush- 
ing in backward through 
the veils of broken cloud, 
tobogganing down the atmos- 
phere of Station Four. Fires of 
deceleration jetted red from the 
reactor ports, roaring their hur- 
ricane thrust against the clutch of 
gravity. 

Air thickened: the glittering 
rocket speck slid easier, settling 
down like a parachuting missile. 
Sunlight splashed its metal sides 
with light and the blue ocean 
waters billowed wide to swallow 
it. The ship dipped in a wide arc 
and backed down toward the 
reddish-grecn-clad land. 

Inside its tiny cabin, the three 
mien lay strapped and waiting for 
the shock of contact. Their eyes 
were closed, their hands tight and 
blood-drained. 

Muscle blocks struggled against 
the drag. 

The ground swept up. The ship 
settled hard on its rear braces, 
trembling. Then, finally, it stood 
motionless and silent, success- 
fully navigated through scores of 
light years of vacuum night. 

A quarter mile away were the

warehouse, village and house. 

C ritical. That was official 

record. Station Four, the 
Three-Moon Psycho Ward. 
David Lindell knew it; all the 
Wentner men knew and won- 
dered. 

Wentner's Interstellar Trading 
Company put a man on other 
stations, for two years at a clip. 
Here on Four it was only for six 
months. Why? Because it was 
critical. Why? Nobody could 
stand the place longer than six 
months. Why? It always came to 
*Vhy”? 

“But like I always say,” Lindell 
said, “it’s no use worrying my- 
self.” 

JJe said it to Martin, the ship’s 
co-pilot, as the two of them 
trudged across the wide meadow 
toward the distant comjJound, 
carrying Lindell’s luggage. 

“You have the right idea,** 
said Martin. “Don’t worry your- 
self.” 

“That’s what I always say,” 
said Lindell. “They’re paying me 
enough and they have to take 
care of me if anything happens. 
Its their headache.” 

They passed the silent gargan- 
tuan warehouse. The sliding 
doors were half open and, inside, 
Lindell could see the concrete 
floor empty and sunlight filter- 
ing bright ribbons through the 
skylight. Martin told him the 



cargo ship had emptied it out 
a few weeks before. Lindell grunt- 
ed and shifted his luggage. 

“Where are the workers?” he 
asked. 

Martin gestured toward the 
native village about three hun- 
dred yards away. There was no 
sound from the low-slung white 
dwellings methodically arranged 
to form three sides of a rectangle. 
The windows blinked fiercely in 
the sunlight. 

“Guess they’re sacked down,” 
Martin judged. “They sleep a lot 
when work is done. You’ll see 
them tomorrow when shipments 
start coming in again.” 

“Got their families with them?” 
Lindell asked. 

“Nope.” 

“Thought it was company pol- 
icy.” 

“Not here. The Gnees don’t 
have much family life. Too few 
men and practically all of them 
pretty dumb.” 

“Great,” Lindell said. “Dandy.” 
He shrugged. “Well, it’s no use 
worrying myself about it.” 

While they were on the stairs 
to the hallway of the house, he 
asked Martin where Corrigan 
was. 

“He went home with the cargo 
ship,” Martin said. “The com- 
pany allows that once in a while. 
There’s nothing to do here any- 
way after the goods are picked 
up.”

“Oh,” said Lindell. “What’s 
this door?" He kicked it open and 
looked in at the combination 
living room-library. 

“All the comforts of," he said. 

“More,” said Martin, looking 
over Lindell’s shoulder. “Over 
there you have a movie projector 
and a tape recorder." 

“Swell," Lindell said. “I can 
talk to myself legal." Then he 
grimaced. “Let’s dump these 
bags. My arms are falling off." 

They shuffled down the hall 
and Lindell glanced into the 
small 'kitchen as they passed. It 
was porcelain-paneled and well 
kept. ^ 

“Can this Gnee woman cook?" 
he asked. 

“From what I hear,” said Mar- 
tin, “you’ll be packing it in like 
a king." 

“Glad to hear it. Incidentally, 
you got any idea why they call 
this joint the Three-Moon Psycho 
Ward?" 

“Who calls it?" 

“The boys back on Earth.” 

“The boys are all wet You'll 
like it here." 

“But why is it only a six month 
stint?" 

“I don’t know — maybe the 
company doesn’t want its help to 
stay here for good,” said Martin. 
“Here’s your bedroom." 

A S they entered, the Gnee 
woman was making the bed, 



her back to the door. Thr 
thumped down the. bags and sh 
turned slowly, unalarmed o 
startled. Lindell’s hands twitched 
Oh, well, he thought, I’ve seen 
worse in my day. 

She wore a heavy robe fastened 
at the neck and falling to the 
floor like a truncated cone of 
cloth. All he could see was her 
head. 

It was a squat coars^y grained 
head, pink and hairless — like the 
mottled belly of an expecting 
chihuahua, he decided. For ears, 
there were cavities on- the sides 
of her flat chinless face. Her nose 
was a stub, singic-nostrilcd. Het 
lips were thick and monkeylike, 
outlining a small circle of moutli 

Hello, Lover, Lindell decided 
not to say. 

She came across the room 
quietly and he blinked at her 
eyes. Then she placed a moist, 
spongy hand in his. 

“Hya," he said. 

“She can’t hear," Martin said. 
“Telepathic." 

“That’s right, I forgot.” 

Hello, he thought, and Hello 
came back the answering wel- 
come. It is ^jood to have you. 

“Thanks,” he said. She seems 
like a decent kid. he thought to 
himself: weird but homy. A ques- 
tion touched his brain like a 
timid hand. 

“Yeah, sure," he said. Yes, he 
added in his mind.

“What’s that?” Martin asked. 

“She asked if she should un- 
pack. I think.” Lindell slumped 
down on the bed. “Ah,” he said, 
“this I like.” He pushed exploring 
fingers into the mattress. 

“Say, how do you know it’s a 
■he?” he asked when he and Mar- 
tin were walking back down the 
bill while the Gnee woman un- 
packed. 

“The robe. The males don’t 
wear robes.” 

“That’s all?” 

Martin looked away. “A few 
other things of absolutely no in- 
terest to you.” 

They moved into the living 
room and Lindell tried out the 
easy chair for size. He leaned 
ba^ and stroked the arms with 
satisfied fingers. 

“Critical or not,” he said, “this 
station has ’em all beat for com- 
fort.” 

He sat there, momentarily re- 
membering the woman’s eyes. 
They had seemed huge, covering 
a full third of her face, like 
big glass saucers with dark cup 
rings for pupils. And they were 
moist; bowls of liquid. He 
shrugged and let it go. So what, 
he thought, it’s nothing. 

“Hah? What?” he asked, hear- 
ing Martin’s voice. 

“I said be careful.” Martin was 
hjolding up a shiny gas pistol. 
“This is loaded,” he warned. 

“Who neods it?” 



“You won’t. Just standard 
equipment.” Martin dropped it 
back in the desk drawer and 
shoved the drawer back in. “And 
you know where all your books 
are,” he said. “The warehouse 
office is set up like all the other 
station offices.” 

Lindell nodded. “I won’t get 
lost.” 

Martin glanced at his watch. 
“Well, I have to be going. Let’s 
see,” he continued, as he and 
Lindell started for the door, “any- 
thing else to tell you? You know 
the rule about not harming the 
people, of course.” 

“Who’s, gonna harm them? 
Whoops!” 

They’d almost knocked her 
over as they exited from the 
room. She jumped back one more 
bouncy step and stared at them, 
eyes wide and frightened. 

“Take it easy, kiddo,” Lindell 
soothed. “What’s up?” 

Eat? The thought cringed before 
him like a beggar at the back 
door of his mind. 

He pursed his lips and nodded. 
“You took the words right out of 
my head.” 

He looked at her and concen- 
trated. ril be back as soon as 1

“Where’s she off to like a bat?” 
Martin asked curiously, as they

turned for the stairs. 

“She’s going to rustle me a 
snack,” Lindell chuckled as they 
descended. “That’s what I call 
service de luxe. This telepathy 
is okay, you know? At other 
stations it was either learn half 
the language to get a ham sand- 
wich or try and teach 'em Eng- 
lish so I wouldn’t starve. Either 
way I really had to sweat for my 
supper until things got settled.” 

He looked pleased. 

“This is real hot,” he said. 

Their heavy boots crushed 
down the tall crisp blue grass as 
they approached the upright ship. 

Martin held out his hand. 
“Take it easy, Lindell. See you in 
six moirths.” 

“Right enough. Give old man 
Wentner a kick in the pants for 
me.” 

“Will do.” 

He watched the co-pilot dwin- 
dle in size, ascending the metal 
ladder to the hatchway. A mid- 
get Martin pulled himself into the 
ship and clanged the metal port 
shut. Lindell waved back at the 
tiny figure at the port and then 
turned and walked away to es- 
cape the blast. 

He stood on a hill underneath 
the heavy scarlet foliage of a tree. 
Inside the ship’s belly there was 
a liquid cough, a rush of explod- 
ing gases. He watched the ship 
hang for a moment on its flaming 
exhaust and then flash up into the 



green-blue sky, leaving scorched 
ground in its wake. The next in- 
stant it was gone. 

He walked in lazy strides back 
toward the house, gazing ap- 
preciatively at the profusion of 
livid plants and flowers in the 
meadow around him. bulbous in- 
sects hanging over them. 

He took off his jacket and let it 
hang from one hand as he walked. 
The sun felt good on his lean 
back. 

“Boys,” he said to the fragrant 
air, “you’re all wet.” 

^^HE great blazing sun was al- 
most gone, spraying the sky 
red with the blood of its cyclic 
dying. Soon the three moons 
would rise — guaranteed to drive 
insane a man looking for a shad- 
ow he could call his own. 

Lindell sat at the living room 
window, gazing out over the 
countryside. You couldn't beat it, 
he thought; tor air or climate or 
all the things that grew in Earth- 
paling technicolor. Nature outdid 
herself in this tucked-away cor- 
ner of the Galaxy. 

He sighed and stretched, won- 
dering about supper. 

Drink? 

He started, chopping a yawn in 
half, and drew his fingers togeth- 
er so fast that the knuckle bones 
crackled. 

He saw her standing at -his 
side offering a tray with a glass

on it. He reached for it, feeling 
his heart placate itself after the 
initial jolt. 

“I’d knock or something,” he 
suggested. 

The big eyes were elliptical 
now. They stared at him without 
comprehension. 

“Well, let it go,” he said, after 
a sip of the warm, tangy liquid. 
He smacked his lips and took 
another sip, a long one. 

“Damn good,” he said. 
“Thanks, Lover.” 

He blinked at himself. That 
brings a guy up short, he decided. 
Lover? Of all the unlikely names 
in the Universe. 

He glanced at her with a 
chuckle bubbling up in his throat. 

^ She hadn’t moved. Her face 
was screwed up into what he as- 
sumed was a smile. But her 
mouth wasn’t designed for smil- 
ing. 

“Hey, when are we eating?” he 
asked, feeling an edge uncomfort- 
able under the unmoving gaze of 
her watery eye globes. 

She turned and hurried to the 
door. 

There she turned. 

All ready already, he got the 
the message. 

He grinned, downed the drink, 
got up and followed her eager 
shuffle down the dim hallway. 

Some time later he pushed 
away the plate with a sigh and 
leaned back in the chair. 



“That’s what I call good,” he 
said. 

Like a hidden spring, he felt 
her pleasure well up in his mind. 
Lover thanks you. 

She certainly picked up the 
name fast, he thought. 

She looked at him, eyes wide. 

Was she trying to smile again? 
he wondered. To him the ex- 
pression looked like all her others 
— the facial poses of an idiot. 
He thought she was smiling, 
though, because of the thoughts 
that accompanied the expression. 

Then he found his eyes invol- 
untarily watering in empathy and 
he turned his head, blinking. A 
trifle nervously, he dumped a tea- 
spoon of sugar in his coffee and 
stirred. He could still feel her 
gaze on him. A twinge of dis- 
pleasure marred his thoughts and 
she turned away abruptly. That’s 
better, he thought, and felt all 
right again. 

“Hey, tell me, Lover,” he start- 
ed to say. Well, might as well 
get used to it, he figured. 

You have a husband? 

Her returned thoughts were 
confused. 

A jnate? he re-worded. 

Oh, yes. 

In the worker’s village? 

They have no mates, she said, 
and he thought he sensed a note 
of hauteur in her reply. 

He shrugged and took a sip of 
coffee. “Well,” he said, “one sat-

isfied worker would drive the rest 
of ’em crazy anyway. They'd be 
biting their nails if -they have 
nails. And on that note — good 
night." 

In bed he sat writing in his 
much-used diary. Between its 
battered covers were inscribed the 
sparse comments he had made on 
half a dozen different planets. 
This was his seventh station. 

“My lucky number,” he para- 
graphed in blue ink. 

Again no sound. To sleep? His 
pen skiddled and spat out three 
fat blots. He looked up and saw 
her with the tray again. 

“Yeah,” he said. Yeah. Thanks, 
Lover. But, look, will you just 
let me know when you. He 
stopped, seeing that it was hope- 
less. 

“This will make me sleep?” he 
asked. 

Oh, yes, was the reply. 

He took a sip, looking down at 
the ink-blotted page. Just started 
it anyway, he thought; no loss of 
priceless literature. He ripped out 
the page and crumpled it in one 
hand. 

“This is good stuff,” he said, 
nodding his head toward the glass. 
He held up the paper. 

Throw it away, hah? Throw 
away? she asked. 

“That’s right,” he said. “Now 
clear out. What in hell are you 
doing in a man’s boudoir any- 
way?” 



She scuttled across the floor 
and he grinned as she closed the 
door quietly behind herself. 

Finishing the drink, he set it 
down on the bedside table and 
turned off the lamp. He settled 
back on the soft pillow with a 
sigh. Critical, he thought in drow- 
sy satisfaction. Nuts. 

Good night. 

He opened his heavy-lidded 
eyes and looked around. There 
was no one in the room. He sank 
back. 

Good night. 

He raised up on one elbow, 
squinting into the darkness. 

Good night. 

“Oh,” he said. “Good night, 
yourself.” The thoughts abated. 
He fell back again and made his 
mouth a tooth-edged cave with 
yawning. 

“How about that?” he mutter- 
ed thickly, turning on his side. 
“Absolutely no mirrors. See? 
Nothin’ up my sleeves. Howbou- 
tha. 

He had a dream. The dream 
covered him with sweat. 

A FTER breakfast, he left the 
house with her farewells tug- 
ging at his brain, and headed 
across the grounds for the ware- 
house. Already, he saw, the Gnee 
men were formed in a moving 
line, carrying bundles on their 
heads. They marched into the 
warehouse, deposited their bur-

den on the concrete and had it 
checked off by a Gnee foreman 
who stood in the center of the 
floor, holding a clipboard thick 
with paper-thin vouchers. 

As Lindcll approached, the 
men all bowed and looked more 
cowed as they hastened on their 
rounds. 'He noticed that their 
heads were flatter than Lover's, 
a little more darkly tinted, and 
with smaller eyes. Their bodies 
were broad and thick-muscled. 

They do look stupid, he 
thought. 

As he came up to the man who 
was doing the checking and sent 
out an unanswered thought, he 
saw that they weren’t telepathic 
cither. Or maybe didn’t want to 
be. 

% “How doody," said the man in 
a squeaky voice. “I check. You 
check?” 

“That's okay,” Lindell said, 
pushing back the clipboard. “Just 
bring it into the office when the 
first batch is all in.” 

“What, hah?” said the mao. 

Jeez, are you a case, Lindcll 
thought: “Bring this.” he said, 
tapping the clipped sheaf of pap- 
ers, “Bring to office.” He pointed 
again. “Bring to me . me! When 
goods are all in.” 

The man’s splotchy face lit up 
with a look of eager stupidity and 
he nodded brightly. Lindell pat- 
ted his shoulder. Good boy. rasp- 
ed his mind. 1 bet you’re dyna- 



mite in a crisis. 

He headed for the office, grit- 
ting his teeth. 

Inside, he shut the plastiglass 
door behind him and looked 
around the office. It was all the 
same as he remembered from 
other stations, except for the cot 
in one corner. 

Don't tell me I have to sleep 
out here nights, he thought with 
a groan. 

He moved closer. On the flat 
soil-cased pillow was the imprint 
of a head. He picked up a light 
brown hair. And what in the hell 
is this? he wondered. Under the 
cot he found a belt without a 
buckle. On the wall by the cot 
there were violent scratches, as 
though a man in fever had tried 
to get out of the office the hard 
way. He stared at them. 

The joint is haunted, he con- 
cluded with a vague shake of his 
head. Then he turned away with 
a shrug. No use worrying myself, 
he thoughL I got six months to 
go and nothing's going to get me 
down. 

He sat down quickly before the 
desk and dragged the heavy sta- 
tion log before himself. He flipped 
opea the heavy cover and started 
reading from the beginning. 

The first entries were twenty 
years dry. They were signed Jef- 
ferson Winters or, a Httle later, 
a hasty Jeff. At the end of six 
months and fifty-tv/o closely 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



packed pages. Lindell found page 
53 covered with' a floridly penned 
message. “Station Four, good-by 
forever!” Jeff didn't seem to have 
had any difficulties adjusting to 
the life there. 

Lindtll shifted back in the 
creaking chair and pulled the 
heavy book on his lap with a sigh 
of boredom. 

It was after the first replace- 
ment’s second month that the 
entries started to get ragged. 
There were blurred words, hur- 
ried scrawling, mistakes deleted 
and re-done. Some of the errors 
apparently had been corrected 
much later by still another re- 
placement. 

It was that way through the 
next four hundred or so sleep- 
inducing pages; a sorry chain of 
flaws and eventual correction. 
Lindell flipped through them 
wearily without the slightest in- 
terest in their content. 

Then he reached the entries 
signed Bill Corrigan and, with a 
blinking yawn, he straightened 
himself up, propped the book on 
the desk and paid closer atten- 
tion. 

They were the same as in every 
case before, excluding the first 
one — efficient beginnings declin- 
ing markedly to, increased wild- 
ness, the penmanship erring more 
extravagantly with each month 
until, at last, it became almost 
illegible. He found a few blat- 



antly miscalculated additions 
which he corrected in his careful 
hand. 

Corrigan's writing, he noted, 
.broke off in the middle of a word 
one afternoon. And for the last 
month and a half of Corrigan’s 
stay, there were nothing but 
blank pages. He thumbed through 
them carelessly, shaking his head 
slowly^ 

Have to admit it, he thought. 
I don’t get it. 

S ITTING in the living room 
through twilight and, later, 
at supper, he began to get the 
sensation that Lover’s thoughts 
were somehow alive, like micro- 
scopic insects crawling in and out 
among the fissures of his brain. 
Sometimes they barely moved; 
Other times they leaped excitedly. 
Once, when he became a little ir- 
ritated with her staring, the 
thoughts were like invisible sup- 
pliants pawing weepily at his 
mind. 

What was worse, he realized 
while reading in bed, the sensa- 
tion occurred even when she 
wasn't in the same room with 
him. It was disconcerting enough 
to feel an endless stream of 
thoughts flowing into him while 
she was close; this remote con- 
trol business was just a little too 
much for his taste. 

Hey, how aboat it? he tried to 
reason her away good-naturedly. 



LOVEK WHEN YOU'RE NEAR ME 



89 



But all he got back was the pic- 
ture of her looking at him wide- 
eyed and uncomprehending. 

"Ah, nuts,” he muttered and 
tossed his book on the bedside 
table. Maybe that's it, he thought, 
settling down for the night; this 
telepathy gimick. Maybe that 
-vas what ^ot the other men. Well, 
iot me, he vowed. / just won't 
/orry myself about it. And he 
.urned out the lamp, said good 
light to the air and went to 
sleep. 

"Sleep,” he muttered, unaware, 
only partly conscious. It wasn’t 
sleep. Not deep enough by half. 
A cloudy ha2e submerged his 
mind and filled it with the same 
detailed scene. It telescoped and 
san^ away in a burst. It magni- 
fied, welling up and swallowing 
him and everything. 

Lover. Lover. The echo of a 
shriek in a long black corridor. 
The robe fluttering close by. He 
saw her pale features. “No,” he 
said, "stay away. Far, close, be- 
yond, upon.” He cried out- “No. 
No. NO!” 

He jolted up in the darkness 
with a choking grunt, eyes full 
open. He stared groggily around 
the empty bedroom, his thoughts 
broiling. 

He reached out in the darkness 
and flicked on the lamp. Hur- 
riedly, he stuck a cigarette be- 
tween his lips and lay slumped 
against the headboard, blowing 



out clouds of curling smoke. He 
raised his hand and saw that it 
shook. He muttered words with- 
out sense. 

Then his nostrils twitched and 
his lips drew back in revulsion. 
What the hell died.^ he thought. 
There was a heavy saccharine 
odor in the air, getting worse 
every second. He tossed off the 
covers. 

At the foot of the bed he 
found them — a thick pile of livid 
purple flowers arranged as an 
offering. 

He looked at them a moment 
and then bent over to pick them 
up and throw them away. He 
drew back, gasping, as a thorn 
punctured "his right thumb. 

He pressed out bright blood 
drops and sucked the wound, his 
brain assailed by the thickening 
smell of the ugly blooms. 

T’S very nice of you, he sent 
her the message, but no more 
Sowers. 

She looked at him. She doesn’t 
get it, he knew. 

"Do you understand?” he 
asked. 

Floods of affecticwi gurgled over 
the layers of his brain like syrup. 
He stirred his coffee restlessly 
and the transfer eased as though 
she were determined not to offend 
him. The kitchen was silent ex- 
cept for the clink of his silver on 
the breakfast dishes and the slight

whispering rustle of her robe. 

He gulped down coffee and 
stood up to leave. 

ril eat lunch around . 

I know. Her thought cut into 
his, mildly commanding. He 
grinned a little to himself as he 
headed down the hall. Her tele- 
pathed message had come with 
an almost motherlike chiding. 

Then, crossing the grounds, he 
recalled the dream again and the 
departing grin emptied his fea- 
tures of amusement. 

All morning he wondered ir- 
ritably what made the Gnee men 
so stupid. If they dropped a bun- 
dle. it was a project to pick it up 
again. They're like brain/ess 
cows, he thought, watching them 
through the office windows as 
they plodded through their tasks, 
eyes dull and unblinking, their 
thick shoulders sloping inward. 

He knew definitely now that 
they weren’t telepathic. He’d tried 
several times to give them orders 
with his mind alone and there 
was no receipt of message. They 
reacted only to loudly repeated 
words of two syllables or, pref- 
erably, less. And they reacted 
moronically at that. 

In the middle of the morning 
he looked up from the backlog 
of paper work that Corrigan had 
left and realized, with some 
shock, that her thoughts were 
reaching him all the way from 
the house. 



And yet they weren’t thoughts 
he could translate into words. 
They were just sensations, amor- 
phously present. He got the feel- 
ing that she was checking, send- 
ing out exploratory beams now 
and again to see if all was well 
with him. 

The first few times it did no 
more than amuse him: he 

chuckled softly and went back to 
his work. 

But then the proddings as- 
sumed an annoyingly regular 
time pattern and he began to 
squirm in his chair. He found 
himself becoming rigidly erect 
and anticipating them seconds be- 
fore they came. 

By late morning he was repuls- 
ing them consciously, tossing his 
pen on the desk and ordering her 
angrily to leave him alone when 
he worked. Her thoughts would 
break off contritely — and soon 
come back again, like creeping 
things that stole upon him, in- 
sinuating and beyond insult. 

His nerves began to fray a 
little. He left the office and 
prowled the warehouse floor, tear- 
ing open bundles and checking 
goods with impatient fingers. The 
thoughts followed him around 
faithfully. 

“How doody," said the Gnee 
foreman every time Lindell 
passed, making him angrier yet. 

Once he straightened up sud- 
denly over a bundle arid said 



lOVER WHEN YOU'RE NEAR ME 



85 



loudly, “Go awayl” 

The foreman jumped a foot in 
the air. His pencil and clipboard 
went flying, and he hid behind a 
pillar and looked fearfully at 
Lindell. 

Lindell pretended not to notice. 

L ater, back in- the office, he 
sat thinking, the wDpen log 
book before him. 

No wonder the Gnee men didn’t 
telepath, he thought. They knew 
what was good for them. 

Then he looked out the window 
at the plodding line of workers. 

What if they weren’t just 
avoiding telepathy? What if they 
were incapable of it; had once 
held the ability and, because of 
it, h^ been broken to their pres- 
ent state of witless stolidity? 

He thought of what Martin had 
said about the women outnum- 
bering the men. And a phrase en- 
tered his brain — matriarchy by 
mind. The phrase offended him, 
but he was suddenly afraid that 
it might be true. It would explain 
why the other men had cracked. 
For if the women were in con- 
trol, it might well be that, in their 
inherent lust for dominance, they 
made no distinction between their 
own men and the men from 
Earth. A man is a man is a man. 
He twisted angrily at the idea of 
possibly being considered on a 
level with the dolts who lived in 
the village. 



He stood up abruptly. I’m not 
hungry, he thought, not at all. 
But Vm going back to the house 
and order her to make me lunch 
and let her know I’m not hungry 
eifher. I'll make her used to be- 
ing dominated herseli and then 
she'll get no chance to pick at 
me. No bug-eyed female Gnee, 
by God, is going to get me down! 

Then he blinked and turned 
away quickly when he realized 
that he was staring at the wild 
pattern of scratches on the far 
office wall, and the belt without 
a buckle that still curled limply 
underneath the cot. 

^rHE dream again. It tore at 
his brain tissues with claws 
of razor. Sweat covering him, he 
tossed on the bed with a groan 
and was suddenly awake, star- 
ing into the darkness. 

He thought he saw something 
at the foot of the bed. He closed 
his eyes and shook his head and 
looked again. The room was 
empty. He felt mind-drenching 
thoughts recede like some alien 
fog. 

His fists contracted angrily. 
She's been at me while I slept, 
he thought. Goddam her hide, 
she's been at me. 

He pushed back the covers and 
crawled to the foot of the bed 
nervously. 

He couldn’t see them, but the 
cloying fumes undulated up from 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

the floor like erected serpents 
slithering into his nostrils. Gag- 
ging, he slumped down on the 
mattress, his stomach wrenched. 

Why? His brain mumbled over 
and over. My God, why? 

Angrily, he threw the flowers 
away in her sight and the 
thoughts pleaded and showered 
over him like raindrops. 

"I said no, didn’t I?” he yelled 
at her. 

Then he sat down at the table 
and controlled himself as well as 
he could. I've got a long way to 
go, he told his will. Ease off, ease 
off. 

Now he was sure he knew why 
it was only six months; that 
would be more than enough. But 
I won’t crdck, . he commanded 
himself. It’s a cinch she isn't go- 
ing to crack, so conserve your- 
self. She’s too stupid to crack, he 
thought deliberately, hoping she’d 
pick it up. 

She apparently did, for her 
shoulders slumped dejectedly all 
at once. And. during breakfast, 
she circled him like a timorous 
wraith, keeping her face averted 
and her thoughts aloof. He found 
himself almost sorry for her then. 
It probably wasn’t her fault. It 
was just an inborn trait among 
the Gnee women. 

Then he realized that her 
thoughts were at him again, ten- 
der and gratefully maudlin, fie 
tried to neutralize himself and ig- 



nore them as they sought to break 
through his apathy like honeyed 
picks. 

All day he worked hard and 
made payments in spices and 
grain to the Gnee foreman. He 
wondered if the payments would 
go eventually to the women— 
wherever they were. 

“I’m taping my voice,” he dic- 
tated later that night. “I want 
to hear myself talking so I 
forget her. There’s no one else 
here to talk to: I have to talk to 
myself. A sad case. Well, here 
goes. 

“Here I am on Station Four, 
folks, having a wonderful time 
and wish you were here instead 
of me. Oh, it’s not that bad. 
Don’t get me wrong. But I guess 
I know what knocked out Corri- 
gan and the poor bastards before 
him. It was Lover and her can- 
nibal mind eating them up. But 
I’ll tell you ^this, cousins; it’s 
not going to eat me up. That 
much you can put bets on. Lover 
isn’t going to . 

"No, I didn’t call you! Come 
on, get out of my life, will you? 
Go to a movie or something. 
Yeah, yeah, I know. Well, go 
to bed then. Just leave me alone. 

Alone. 

"There. That for her. She’ll 
have to go some to get me claw- 
ing at the wallpaper.” 

But he carefully locked the 
door to his room when he went 



• %7 



LOVER WHEN YOU'RE NEAR ME 



to bed. And he groaned in his 
sleep because of the same night- 
mare and his limbs thrashed and 
all peace and rest were crowded 
out. 

He twisted into wakefulness in 
mid-morning and stumbled up 
to check the door. He fumbled at 
the lock with heavy fingers. 
Finally his thickened centers di- 
vined the fact that the door was 
still locked and he went back to 
bed in a weaving line and fell on 
it into a stupored sleep. 

When he woke up in the morn- 
ing, there were flowers at the foot 
of his bed, luxuriantly purple and 
foul-smelling. 

The door was still locked. 

T¥E couldn’t ask her about it 
because he left the kitchen 
in revulsion when she called him 
dear. 

No more flowers. I promise, 
cried her pursuing thoughts. He 
locked himself in the living room 
and sat at the desk, feeling sick. 
Get hold of yourself! he ordered 
his system, clasping his hands 
tightly and holding his teeth 
firmly clenched. 

Eat? She was outside the door; 
he knew it. 

He closed his eyes. Go away, 
leave me alone, he told her. 

Vm sorry, dear, she said, 

“Stop calling me dear!” he 
•houted, slamming his fist on the 
desk surface. As he twisted in the 



chair, his belt buckle caught on 
the drawer handle and it jerked 
out. He found himself staring 
down at the shiny gas pistol. Al- 
most unconsciously he reached 
down and touched its slick barrel. 

He shoved in the drawer with 
a convulsive movement. None of 
that! 

He looked around suddenly, 
feeling alone and free. He got up 
and hurried to the window. Down 
below, he saw her hurrying across 
the grounds with a basket on her 
arm. She's iolni for vegetables, 
he thought. But what made her 
leave so suddenly? 

Of course. The pistol. She must 
have gotten his thoughts of vio- 
lent intent. 

He sighed and calmed down a 
little. I've still ^ot cards In my 
hand, he soothed himself. 

While she was out, he decided 
to look in her room and see if 
he could find the shifting panel 
that enabled her to enter his room 
with the flowers. He hurried down 
the hall and pushed open the door 
to her barely furnished little 
chamber. 

His brain was immediately at- 
tacked by the odor of a reeking 
pile of the purple flowers in one 
corner. He held a hand over his 
mouth and nose as he looked 
down in distaste at the living and 
dead blossoms. 

What did they represent? An 
offering of thoughtfulness? His 



•8 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



throat contracted. Or was it more 
than thoughtfulness? He grim- 
aced at the thought and remem- 
bered that first evening when he’d 
dubbed her Lover. What had pos- 
sessed him to choose that name 
from the infinity of possible 
names? He hoped he didn’t know. 
He hoped he’d never know. 

On her couch he found a small 
pile of odds and ends. There 
was a button, a pair of broken 
shoe laces, the piece of crumpled 
paper he had told her to throw 
away. And a belt buckle with the 
initials W. C. stamped on it. 

There were no secret panels. 

He sat in the kitchen staring 
into an untouched cup of coffee. 
No way she could get in his 
room. W. C. — William Corrigan. 
He had to fight it, keep fight- 
ing it. 

Time passed. Suddenly he re- 
alized that she was back in the 
house again. There was no sound ; 
it was like the return of a ghost. 
But he knew it. A cloud of feel- 
ing preceded her, came plunging 
through the rooms like an ex- 
cited puppy searching. Thoughts 
swirled. 

You are well? You ate not 
angry? Lover is bade— ell hastily 
and eagerly clutching at him. 

She swept into the room so 
quickly that his hands twitched 
and he upset the cup. The hot 
liquid splashed over his shirt and 
trousers as he jumped back, 



knocking over the chair. 

She put down the basket and 
got a towel. He stood there, lips 
drained of color as she patted 
the stains dry. She’d never been 
so close to him. Slic’d never actu- 
ally touched him before except 
for that first revolting handshake. 

There was an aroma about her; 
it made his chest heave painfully. 
And all the time, her thougiits 
caressed his mind as her hands 
seemed to be caressing his body. 

There, there, I am here with 
you, David dear. 

Almost in horror, he stared at 
her spongy pink skin, her huge 
eyes, her tiny wound of a mouth. 

And, in the office that morning, 
he made three straight mistakes 
in the log book and tore out the 
whole page and hurled it across 
the room with a choking cry of 
rage. 

A VOID her. No point in argu- 
ing or threatening. He tried 
to raze his mental ground so that 
her thoughts could not find do- 
micile there. If he relaxed his 
mind enough, her thoughts flowed 
through and out, perhaps taking 
part of his will as they left, but 
he had to risk that. 

And if he worked hard and 
crowded his head with stodgy, 
banks of figures, it kept her at a 
distance and his hands did not 
tremble so badly. 

Maybe I should sleep in the

office, he thought. 

Then he found Corrigan’s note. 
It was on a slip of paper stuck 
away in the log book, hidden 
white on white. He only found it 
because he was going through the 
pages one at a time, reciting the 
dates in a loud voice to keep his 
mind filled. 

“God help me,” read the note, 
black and jagged-lettered. “Lover 
comes through the walls!" 

Lindell stared. 

“I saw it myself.” attested the 
words. “I’m going out of my 
mind. Always that damn animal 
mind tugging and tearing at me. 
And now I can’t even shut away 
her body. I slept out here, but 
she came anyway.” 

T.indell read it again and it was 
a wind fanning the fires of terror. 
Through the walls. The words 
agonized him. Was it possible? 

It was Corrigan, then, who had 
named her Lover. From the very 
start, the relationship had been 
on her terms. Lindell had had 
nothing to say about it. 

“Lover ” he muttered, and her 
thoughts enveloped him suddenly 
like a bat’s wings swooping down 
from the sky. He flung up his 
arms and cried out, “Leave me 
alone!” 

And, as her phantom mind 
slipped off, he had the sense that 
it was with less timidity, with 
the patience such as a man know- 
ing his own great strength can 



afford to display. 

He sank back on the chair, ex- 
hausted suddenly, depleted with 
fighting it. He crumpled the note 
in his right hand, thinking of 
the scratches on the wall behind 
him. And he saw in his mind Cor- 
rigan tossing on the cot, burning 
with fever, rearing up with a 
shriek of horror to see her stand- 
ing before him. 

But then? The scene was dark. 

He rubbed a shaking hand over 
his face. Don't crack, he said to 
himself. But it was more a fright- 
ened entreaty than a command. 
Wasting fogs of premonition 
flooded over him in chilling 
waves. 

She comes through the walls. 

That night again, he poured 
down the bathroom sink the po- 
tion she had made. He locked the 
door and, in the lightless room, 
he squatted in one corner, peering 
and waiting, lungs bellowing only 
because he forced himself to re- 
member to breathe. 

The thermostat lowered the 
heat. The floorboards got icy and 
his teeth started chattering. I’m 
not ^oin^ to bed, he vowed 
angrily. He didn’t know why it 
was suddenly the bed that 
frightened him. I don’t know, he 
forced the words through his 
brain, because he felt vaguely, 
that he did know and he didn't 
want to admit it, even for a 
second.

But, after hours of futile wait- 
ing, he had to straighten up with 
a snapping of joints and stumble 
back to bed. There he crawled 
under the blankets and lay trem- 
bling, trying to stay awake. 

She'll come while I’m asleep, 
he thought. 

/ mustn’t sleep. 

When he woke up in the morn- 
ing, there were flowers on the 
floor for him. And that was an- 
other day before a mass of days 
that sank crushed into the lump 
of months. 

Y OU can get used to horror, 
he thought, when it has lost 
immediacy and is no longer pun- 
gent and has become a steady 
diet. When it has degraded to a 
chain of mind-numbing events. 
When shocks ate like scalpels 
picking and jabbing at delicate 
ganglia until they have lost all 
feeling. 

Yet, though it was no longer 
terror, it was worse. For his 
nerves were raw and bleeding a 
hemophilia of rage. He fought his 
battles to the dregs of seconds, 
gaunt-willed, shouting her off, 
firing lances of hate from his 
despairing mind, tortured by her 
surrenders that were her victories. 
She always came back; like an 
enraging cat, rubbing endless 
sycophantic sides against him, 
filling him with thoughts of . 
yes, admit it! he screamed 



to himself through midnight 
struggles. 

Thoughts of love. 

And there was the undercur- 
rent, the promise of new shock 
that would topple his already 
shaking edifice. It needed only 
that; an added push, another stab 
of the blade, one more drop of 
the shattering hammer. 

The shapeless threat hung over 
him. He waited for it, poised for 
it a hundred times an hour, es- 
pecially at night Wait. Waiting. 
And sometimes, when he thought 
he knew what it was he was wait- 
ing for, the shock of admission 
made him shudder and made him 
want to claw at walls and break 
things and run until the blackness 
swallowed him. 

If he could only forget her 
for a while, just a little while, 
it would be all right. He mumbled 
it to himself as he set up the 
movie projector. 

She begged from the kitchen, 
Can / see? 

“No!” 

Now all his replies, worded or 
thought, were like the snapping 
retorts of a jangled old man. If 
only the six months would end. 
That was the problem. The 
months were not moving fast 
enough. And time was like her— 
not to be reasoned with or in- 
timidated. 

There were many reels of film 
on the wall shelf, but his hand

reached up without hesitation 
and picked out one. He didn’t 
notice it; his mind was calloused 
to suggestion. He adjusted the 
reel on the spindle and turned out 
the lights. He sat down with a 
tired groan as the flickering milky 
light cone shot out from the lens, 
tlu’owing pictures on the screen. 

A lean dark-bearded man was 
posing. am\5 crossed, white 
teeth showing in an artifleial 
smile. He came closer to the 
. camera. The sun flashed, blurring 
the film a second. Black screen. 
Title: "Picture of Me.” 

The man, high-cheekboned, 
bright-eyed, stood laughing 
soundlessly out from the screen. 
He pointed to his side and tiie 
caviera swung around. Lindell 
sat up sharply. 

, It was the station. 

.. ; Apparently it was fall, for, as 
the camera swept past the house, 
the village, jerking a moment as 
though changing hands, he saw 
the trees surrounded by heaps of 
dead leaves. He sat there shiver- 
ing, waiting for something, he 
didn’t know what. 

. The screen blacked. Another 
title roughly etched in white. 
*‘Jeff in the Office.” 

The man peered at the camera, 
an idiotic smile on his face. 
White skin accentuated by the 
immaculate black outline of his 
beard. 

Fadeout, in. The man doing a 



jig around the empty warehouse 
floor, hands poised delicately in 
the air, his dark hair bouncing 
wildly on his skull. 

Another title flashing on the 
screen, Lindell stiffened in his 
seat, his breath cut off abruptly. 

"Lover.” 

^I^HERE was her face, horribly 
repellent in black and white. 
She was standing by his bedroom 
window, her face a mask of de- 
light. He could tell it was de- 
light now. Once he would have 
said she looked like a maniac, 
her mouth twisted like a living 
scar, her grotesque eyes staring. 

She spun and her robe swirled 
out. He saw her puffy ankles and 
his stomach muscles grew rock 
taut. 

She approached the camera. 
He saw filmy eyelids slide down 
over her eyes. His hands began 
to tremble violently. It was his 
dream. It made him sick. It was 
his dream to the detail. Then it 
had never been a dream; not from 
his own mind. 

A sob tore at his throat. She 
was undoing the robe. Here it ts! 
gibbered, his mind in a panic. 
He whimj^cred and reached out 
shakily to turn off the projector. 

No! It was a cold command ia 
the darkness. Watch me, she or- 
dered. 

He sat bound in a vise of ter- 
ror, staring in sick fascination as

the robe slid from her neck, pulled 
down over her round shoulders. 
She twisted sensuously. The robe 
sank into a heavy swirling heap 
on the floor. 

He screamed, flung out an arm 
that swept into the burning im^o- 
jector. It crashed down on the 
floor. The room was night. He 
struggled up and lurched across 
the room. 

Nice? Nice? The word dug at 
him mercilessly as he fumbled 
for the door. 

He found it. rushed into the 
hall. Her door opened and she 
stood in the half light, the robe 
hanging from one spongy shoul- 
der. 

He jolted to a halt. "Get out of 
here!” he yelled. 

No. 

He made a convulsive move for 
her, hands out like rigid claws. 
The sight of her pink, moist flesh 
spun him away. 

yes.® her mind suggested. It 
seemed as if he heard it spoken 
in a sly rising voice. 

"Listen!" he cried, reaching out 
for the door to his room. "Listen, 
you have to go, do you under- 
stand? Go to your mate.” 

He twisted back in utter horror. 

I am with him now, her mes- 
sage had said. 

The thought paralyred him. He 
stared, open-mouthed, heart 
pounding in slow, gigantic beats 
as the robe slipped over her 



shoulders and started down her 
arms. 

He whirled with a cry and 
slammed the door behind him. 
His Angers shook on the lock. 
Her thoughts were a wailing in 
his mind. He shook in fright and 
sickness and knew it was no good, 
because he couldn’t lock her out. 

^^HERE were monkeys chatter- 
ing in his brain. They lay on 
their backs in a circle and kicked 
at the inside of his skull. They 
grabbed juicy blobs of gray in 
their dirty paws and they 
squee2cd. 

He rolled on his side writh a 
groan. I'll go crazy, he said. Like 
Corrigan, like all oi them but the 
first one — that slimy one who 
started it aU; who added % new 
and hideous warp to the corru- 
gation of her dominating mind — • 
who had narned her Lover be- 
cause he meant it. 

Suddenly he sat up with a gasp 
of terror, staring at the foot of 
the bed. She comes through the 
walls, howled his brain. Nothing 
there, his eyes saw. His fingers- 
clutched at the sheets. He felt 
sweat dripping off his brow and 
rolling down the embankment of 
his nose. 

He lay back. Up again! He 
whimpered like a frightened child. 
A cloud of blackness was falling 
over him. He groaned, “Noy* in 
the blackness.

The blade falling, sanity de- 
capitated and twitching bloody in 
the basket. 

No! 

He tried to push himself up, 
but he couldn’t. Sleep. A black 
tide of night hovering, tracking. 
Sleep. 

He fell on the pillow, pushed 
up weakly on one elbow. 

“No.” His lungs were crusted. 
“No.” 

He struggled. It was too much. 
He screamed a thick bubbling 
scream. She threw his will aside, 
snapped and futile. She was using 
all her strength now and he was 
de-enervated, beaten. He thudded 
back on* the pillow, glassy-eyed 
and limp. He moaned weakly and 
his eyes shut, opened, shut, 
opened, shut . 

The dream again. Insane. Not 
a dream. 

When he woke up, there were 
no flowers. The courtship was 
ended. He gaped blankly and un- 
believingly at the imprint of a 
body beside him on the bed. 

It was still warm and moist. 

H e laughed out loud. He wrote 
curse words in his diary. He 
wrote them in tall black letters, 



holding the pencil like a knife. 
He wrote them in the log book 
too. He tore up vouchers if they 
were not the right color. Hia 
entries were crooked, lines of fig- 
ures like wavy-numbered tendrils. 
Sometimes he didn’t care about 
that. Mostly he didn’t notice. 

He prowled the filled ware- 
house behind locked doors, red- 
eyed and muttering. He clamb- 
ered up on the bundles and stared 
out through the skylight at the 
empty sky, He was lighter by 
fifteen pounds, unwashed. Hit 
face was black with wiry growth. 
He was going to have an immacu- 
late beard. She wanted it. She 
didn’t want him to wash or shave 
(M* be heahhy. She called him 
Jeff dear. 

You can’t fight that, he told 
himself. You can’t win because 
you lose, li you advance you 
are retreating because, when you 
are too tired to fight, she comee 
back and she takes your body 
and your soul. 

That was why he whispered to 
the warehouse so no one would 
hear, “There is a thing to do." 

And that was why. at night, he 
sneaked to the living room and 
put the gas pistol in his pocket. 
Never harm the Gnees. Well, that 
was wrong. It was kill or be 
killed. ^ 

Thaf's why I’m taking the

the ceiling. Yes. this is it. This is 
tny rock to rest on through the 
day-nights. 

And he turned over plans as 
an animal snuffles over flat stones 
to find bugs for supper. 

Days. Days. Days. 

He whispered, “Kill her.” 

He nodded and smiled to him- 
self and patted the cool metal. 

“You’re my friend,” he said. 
“You’re my only friend. She has 
to die. We all know that.” 

He made lots of plans and they 
were all the same one. He killed 
her a million times in his mind, 
in secret chambers of his mind 
that he had discovered and 
opened ; where he could crouch 
clever and undisturbed while he 
mac^ his plans. 

He walked and looked at the 
worker’s village. 

Animals. I’m not going to end 
up like you. I'm not going to 
I'm not ^oin^ to and when I do 
I’m not I am . , 

T ZNDELL lurched up from his 
office desk, eyes wide, slaver 
running over his lips. He held the 
pistol tight in his palsied hand. 

He flung open the office door 
and staggered over the concrete, 
through the lanes between roof- 
high stacks. His mouth was so 
tight that his clamped jaws hurt. 
He held the pistol pointing. 

He kicked up the catch and 
dragged back one heavy door. He 



plunged out into the hot sun- 
light and broke into a run. Wisps 
of terror licked out from the 
house. He thought of murder with 
harder, more savage joy. He ran 
faster. He fell down because his 
legs had no feeling. The pistol 
went flying. He crawled to it and 
tenderly brushed off the dust. 

He stood up dizzily and started 
to hobble. He was hearing things 
— not Lover’s thoughts, for once. 

He looked up and blinked and 
knew he was going insane . 

It was a cargo ship. The cargo 
ship. Only, of course, it couldn't 
be. 

He dropped the pistol and 
slumped down beside it, plucking 
at blue grass with an idiot in- 
tensity that he knew was like 
the Gnee men’s. He was careful 
not to watch the ship as it seemed 
to come down and the hatches 
made an impossibly convincing 
clang and men appeared to climb 
out. 

“Go away,” he said to the illu- 
sion of a man standing beside 
him. “You’re not here. The six 
months aren’t over.” 

His voice was quite normal, ex- 
cept that it broke into giggles 
and sobs while he had a fist fight 
with the air. 

“You’ll be all right,” the man 
apparently said, and he felt some- 
thing that might have been an 
insect bite, though he thought it 
was the man pricking him with a

hypo of sedative. 

Two other mea came with a 
stretcher and a sheet that they 
wrapped him tightly in. and they 
began carrying him, shrieking and 
battling, toward the mirage ship. 

“You can’t take me away!” 
he shouted. ‘T’ve got to kill 
Lover first!” 

“It wouldn’t do any good," the 
first man said. “There are a lot 
more where she came from — 
one at a time for every guy we 
station here, it looks like." 

“She comes through the walls!” 
Lindell screamed. 

“That’s what you get to be- 
lieve,” said the man soothingly. 
“It must be pretty fierce. But 



that’s all over now. You’re going 
back home.” 

Lindell tried to fight free of 
the sheet. “Let me at least warn 
the next guy!” 

“It wouldn’t do any good. He 
wouldn’t believe you. That’s why 
you didn’t see us take away the 
poor character you relieved.” 
And then the sedative took hold 
and Lindell fell asleep. The 
dreams came, but with them was 
the sound of rockets blasting off, 
and the spongy image of the Gnee 
woman grew smaller and smaller 
and less frightful. 

But he still smelled the livid 
flowers. He knew he always would.

T his month I am going to 
devote the main section *of

of the chemical elements. Well, 
it won’t really be a “chart” be-

electrical characteristics. All that 
can be found in textbooks and 
handbooks. What I am concerned 
with — and it took a good deal of 
time to get this information to- 
gether — will be of no use to chem- 
ists or engineers. But k will. I 
hope, be interesting. I want to 
write about the names of the 
elements, what they mean and., 
why their discoverers proposed 
them. 

Element No. 1 is, of course, hy- 
drogen. Nicolas L^mery of France 
discovered it around 1700 and 
suspected that water was one 
of its compounds. The other com- 
ponent of water, oxygen, element 
No. 16. was discovered by Joseph 
Priestly of England and Karl 
Wilhelm Schecle of Sweden some 
75 years later and when it was 
established that elements 1 and 
16 made water (at first thought 
to be HO) the names were tagged 
on. Hydor, a Greek word, means 
water, hence hydrogen, meaning 
“water-former.” The other com- 
ponent of water seemed to be in 
every acid, hence the name oxy- 
gen. “acid-former.” 

Now we know that there are 
acids without oxygen, but none 
without hydrogen. And since the 
oxygen atom is much heavier 
than the hydrogen atom, there is 
far more oxygen in water than 
hydrogen, even though the form- 
ula is H-jO. In short, element No. 
1 should 'he called oxygen and 



No. 16 should be hydrogen. But 
it’s a little late to change them 
around now. 

Element No. 2 is helium, from 
Helios, the Greek sun god, for the 
reason that it was found in the 
solar atmosphere first (by Jules 
Janssen of France in 1868) be- 
fore Sir William Ramsey discov- 
ered it in the Earth's atmosphere 
(1895). No. 3 was named by its 
discoverer, Swede Johan A. Arf- 
wedson of Sweden (1817), with- 
out noticeable thought or 
imagination. Lithos is Greek for 
“stone,” the ore it came from 
looked like stone, hence lithium. 
No. 4 also got its name from the 
mineral in which it occurs. It 
happens to be green and in Latin 
there is a word beryllinus which 
means green-colored, so the ele- 
ment was called beryllium. Sim- 
ilarly, the name of No. 9 was 
derived from one of its minerals. 
The mineral was used — and still 
is — as a flux in metallurgical op- 
erations. German miners, conse- 
quently, called the mineral 
Fluss-spat, which became fluor- 
spar by adaptation of the Latin 
word fJuere, “to flow.” Fluorspar 
is the fluoride of calcium and the 
element was called fluorine. There 
happens to be a minor and acci- 
dental justification for the name: 
it “flows out” of almost anything 
you try to keep it in. 

No. 10. neon, means “ the new** 
because it obviously was new 



FOK YOUR INFORMATION 



when Sir William Ramsay dis- 
covered it in 1898. But No. 11 is 
less obvious. You may have won- 
dered why the chemical symbol 
for sodium is Na. The common 
English name is derived from 
soda, but the symbol is derived 
from the word Natnum, which 
was both common and mysterious 
until somebody found out that 
that the original is an Arabic 
word neter, meaning “herb-ash,” 
as distinct from kalyun, “wood- 
ash.” and accounts for the letter 
K as the symbol for No. 19. 

That K stands for the -interna- 
tional name kalium, but the 
English name was derived from 
pot ash, making it potassium. 
Both were first isolated in 1808 
by ^ir Humphry Davy, who iso- 
lated No. 12, magnesium, at the 
same time. That name is from 
the mineral magnesia, which was 
named in turn after an ancient 
city. Similarly aluminum, No. 13, 
was named after its mineral, 
alum, while No. 14, silicon, got 
its name from silex, which in this 
case is not the trade mark of a 
coffee maker, but the Latin word 
for flint. 

No. 15, phosphorus, has a 
Greek name which is meaningful 
and fitting; it translates as “car- 
rier of light.” The knowledge of 
No. 16, sulphur, however, is so 
old that the meaning of its name 
is no longer remembered. Since 
No. 17, chlorine, is a greenish 



gas, its discoverer, Karl Wilhelm 
Scheele, just used the Greek word 
for "green” (ch/oros) to name it. 
Sir William Ramsay utilized the 
Greek word for “sluggish” to 
name No. 18, argon, because it 
did not want to combine with 
anything else. No. 20, calcium, 
one of Sir Humphry Davy’s dis- 
coveries, derives its name from 
the Latin caJx, “burned lime.” 

When Lars Nilson discovered 
No. 21 in 1879, he called it scan- 
dium, after Scandinavia, but his 
compatriot Baron Jons Jakob 
Berzelius, discoverer, among 
other things, of No. 22, titanium, 
had to justify his choice with 
the excuse that, in Greek mythol- 
ogy, the titans were the “sons 
of the Earth.” No. 23, vanadium, 
was discovered and named by 
Nils Sefstrom of Sweden in 1830. 
He derived it from the Germanic 
goddess Vanadis, better known 
as Frcya, for no reason except 
that he apparently liked the 
sound. 

No. 24, chromium, is from 
chromos, the Greek word for 
“color*’ or “dye”; you know what 
a pronounced color chromium- 
yellow has. But No. 25, man- 
ganese, is a puzzle. Nobody seems 
to know the derivation of the 
word, except that one commen- 
tator remarked that the mineral 
from which manganese is derived 
was wrongly called “black mag- 
nesia” for a while. Since me/as

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 






is Greek for black. I could under- 
stand the connection if the ele- 
ment were called melanganese. 
Maybe it was at one time, but 
I have yet to find proof. 

^ In the case of No. 26, iron, we 
have one of the few elements 
which have been known for so 
long that their names have no 
derivation. The chemical symbol 
FE comes from the Latin ferrum 
and the Greek equivalent sideros 
can be encountered as siderite, 
indicating an iron meteorite. 

Cobalt and nickel. Nos. 27 and 
28. are both German, the former 
meaning gnome (fCobo/d). the 
latter meaning water sprite. The 
nasty creatures fooled the brave 
miners.' handing them ores that 
looked like silver ore, but were 
completely worthless, since ap- 
plied metallurgy had not yet 
progressed to the extraction of 
the metals. They were discovered, 
for the record, by two Swedes, 
cobalt by Georg Brandt in 1735 
and nickel by Axel Cronstedt in 
1754. 

No. 29. copper, although known 
since antiquity, has a name that 
is still traceable. The chemical 
symbol Cu is from the Latin 
name cuprum, and cuprum is in 
all probability derived from the 
island of Cyprus, which was pro- 
nounced “keeprus.” 

No. 30, zinc, is German again, 
from the word Zinke, which 
means protrusion because it sub- 



limed in the furnace and con- 
demned in protrusions in the 
cooler parts. Nos. 31 and 32 are 
Gallium and Germanium; the 
two discoverers, Lecoq dc Bois- 
baudran (1875) and Klemens 
Winkler (1886), honored their 
respective countries. No. 33 is 
arsenic, said to have been iso- 
lated first by Albertus Magnus. 
The name, at any event, is Greek; 
arsen means “strong” or “mascu- 
line.” 

Selenium. No. 34, is one of the 
discoveries of Jons Jakob Ber- 
zelius and is named for the god- 
dess of the Moon, Selene, in the 
Greek pantheon. I suppose he 
had a reason. 

There is a very apparent rea- 
son, though, for the name of 
No. 35. The Greek word bromos 
means “stench” and the discov- 
erer, the Frenchman Antoine- 
J^rome Balard (1825), found out 
during his experiments that some 
of the compounds offend the nose. 
The name of No. 36 is Greek, 
too. for krypton means “hidden” 
and that’s how Sir William Ram- 
say found it — concealed among 
the other so-called noble gases. 

The names of the next few ele- 
ments in the table are also simple, 
once you know what they mean. 
No. 37 is rubidium because of 
its ruby-red line in the spectrum; 
No. 38 is strontium after Stron- 
tian in County Argyll, Scotland: 
No. 39 is yttrium after Yttcrby in

Sweden; and No. 40 is zirconium 
after the name of the gem. 

No. 41 was once called colum- 
bium in English-speaking coun- 
tries, where students had to 
remember that the symbol for co- 
lumbium was Nb. The origin of 
the symbol, the international 
name niobium, has now been offi- 
cially accepted and columbium 
will hence be found only in out- 
of-date textbooks. 

No. 42, its discoverer Peter 
Jakob Hjelm of Sweden thought 
in 1781, looks rather like lead. 
Using the Greek name molybdos, 
meaning lead, he called it molyb- 
denum. No. 43 was originally 
called Masurium, after the land- 
scape of Masuren in East Prussia. 
But^since the two discoverers, 
C)rs. Walter Noddack and Ida 
Tacke, merely proved its exist- 
ence while Oak Ridge actually 
produced it. the original name 
has been discarded in favor of 
technecium from the Greek 
techne, “skill.” 

No. 43, discovered in 1844 by 
Karl Karlovitch Klaus, was also 
given a geographical name, ruthe- 
nium, from Ruthenia — Russia. 
The interesting point is that 
G. W. Osann gave it the same 
name in 1828, sixteen years prior 
to actual isolation. Nos. 45 and 
46 were both discovered by Wil- 
liam Hyde Wollaston in 1803-4; 
No. 45 was called rhodium from 
the Greek word rhodos for “rose,” 

iqi 



while No. 46 was called palla- 
dium, after the then newly dis- 
covered planetoid Pallas. 

Silver is No. 47 and known for 
so long a time that the meaning 
of the name is lost; the symbol 
Ag is from the Latin name' for 
it, argentum. No. 48, cadmium, 
is named after the mineral cad- 
mea; No. 49, indium, has noth- 
ing directly to do with India, 
being derived from the indigo- 
blue line in its spectrum — but the 
name of that color is derived 
from the name of the plant, which 
in turn honors the geographical 
area. No. 50, tin, is one of the 
long known elements; the symbol 
Sn is from the Latin name stan- 
num. 

The very similar symbol for 
No. 51. Sb, stands for the Latin 
name stibium, but the English 
word antimony is Latin, too. Its 
origin is the first two words anti 
monachon, “against the monks,” 
in an edict of Frances II of 
France, forbidding its medicinal 
use by clergy. 

No. 52. tellurium, is from the 
Latin tellus for Earth; No. 53, 
iodine, from the Greek ioeides for 
the color violet; and No. 54, 
xenon, one of Sir William Ram- 
sey’s Greek names, means “stran- 
ger.” Both No. 55 caesium (from 
Latin caes/us, “bluish”) and No. 
56. barium, (from Greek barys, 
“heavy”) seem to make no sense, 
for caesium looks like silver and 

GALAXY SCIENCE. FICTION 



barium is hardly heavier than 
aluminum. But “bluish” refers 
to a line in the spectrum and 
“heavy” refers to the mineral. 

The numbers 57 to 71 are the 
so-called rare’ earth elements of 
which a chemist once wrote that 
they pursue the chemist in his 
dreams, that they split like ame- 
bas and that their chronology 
looks like a list of “begats” from 
the Old Testament. 

Their names reflect some of the 
unhappiness they seem to have 
caused. No. 57, lanthanum, is 
from the Greek word lanthano, 
which means "to escape notice.” 
No. 58, cerium, was named in 
1803 after the recently discovered 
planetoid Ceres (not after the 
goddess directly): No. 59, praseo- 
dymium, is Greek again, meaning 
“green twin.” No. 60, neodymium, 
is also Greek: “new twin” (the 
former didymium had split in 
two). No. 61. long missing, was 
first called Illinium (University 
of Illinois), but Oak Ridge, after 
definite identification, changed 
that to promethium, from Pro- 
metheus, the mythical giver of 
fire. 

No. 62, samarium, was named 
by a Frenchman after the Rus- 
sian mine inspiector Samarski. 
No. 63, europium, was also 
named by a Frenchman, De- 
mar^ay, after the continent, of 
course. No. 64, gadolinium, was 
named in honor of the Finnish 



chemist Gadoltn; No. 65, Ter- 
bium, after Ytterby in Sweden; 
No. 66, dysprosium, comes from 
the Greek word dysprosopon, 
which means “difficult mask.” 
No. 67, Holmium, is derived from 
Holmia, the Latin name of Stock- 
holm; No. 68, erbium, again after 
Ytterby; No. 69, thulium, from 
Thule, the hard - to - identify 
northern land of Pytheas of 
Massilia. 

No. 70 is ytterbium, again 
Ytterby in Sweden! That place 
has a total of four elements 
named after it, three of them rare 
earths, all found in the unusually 
interesting mine that is located 
there. 

No. 71, lutetium, comes from 
Lutet^a, the Latin name for 
Paris, and No. 72. the first ele- 
ment after the rare earth group, 
is hafnium, from Kjobenhavn, 
the Danish spelling of Copen- 
hagen. Its discoverer was a Hun- 
garian, Georg von Hevesy, but 
he commemorated the city in 
which he made the discovery (in 
1923). 

There was once, you probably 
remember, a mythical shade who 
was punished after death by be- 
ing made to stand in water up 
to his neck, but every time he 
tried to bend down and quench 
his thirst, the water receded. 
When Gustaf Ekeberg found (in 
1802) a metal which is insoluble 
in most acids, he thought of this 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



ancient victim and named the 
metal after him: tantalum. Tan- 
talus, by the way, had a daughter 
by the name of Niobe and she 
provided the name for No. 41. 

Tungsten is the Swedish word 
for “heavy stone” and was once 
the name of element No. 74. But 
its chemical symbol was W for 
Wolfram, which was adopted two 
years ago by an international 
congress, so tungsten is no longer 
correct. No. 75, rhenium, dis- 
covered by the same team which 
announced “masurium,” got its 
name from the Latin Rhenus, 
“Rhine.” No. 76 is osmium, ac- 
tually not a flattering name be- 
cause osm^ (Greek) means “bad 
odor.” Its discoverer, the English- 
msm Smithson Tennant, also dis- 
covered No. 77, iridium, which 
he named because of its irides- 
cent solutions. No. 78 is platinum, 
a Spanish word meaning “little 
silver.” No. 79 is gold; the Ger- 
manic word is essentially a paral- 
lel form of the word “yellow” for 
quite obvious reasons. The sym- 
bol Au is from the Latin name 
aurum. No. 80 is mercury (in 
German still Quecksilber), the 
symbol Hg coming from the old 
name hydrargium. No. 81, thal- 
lium, derives from the Greek 
thallos, “green twig.” 

Lead is No. 82 and the word 
is probably a variant of “load” 
(you used it to weigh down 
things, but lodestone, which is 



magnetic iron ore, comes from 
the verb “to lead”). The German 
name, Blei, is derived from that 
old Germanic word bia which 
means both “black” and “blue;” 
to this day, a German soldier 
will refer to bullets as “blue 
beans.” The symbol Pb is from 
the Latin plumbum, which is also 
the root of “plumber.” No. 83, 
bismuth, has an originally Ger- 
man name, which in modern 
rendering would read W/ese- 
matte and denotes a “flowering 
meadow”, a name that makes 
sense if you know the colorful 
display of a pan of hardening 
bismuth. 

Above bismuth, we get into the 
realm of the radioactive elements, 
mostly of recent discovery and 
with artificial names. No.' 84 is 
polonium, so named by Madame 
Sklodowska-Curie after her na- 
tive Poland. No. 85, first called 
alabamine (after the state) is 
now known as astatine from the 
Greek asfasra, “unsteady”. No. 
86 is radon, once called “emana- 
tion,” from the Latin radius for 
“ray;” No. 88, radium, has the 
same derivation. 

No. 87;- discovered in 1947 by 
Mile. Marguerite Perey, is called 
franchium, and No. 89 is ac- 
tinium. Of the radioactive ele- 
ments, only the more stable ones, 
No. 90, thorium, and No. 92, 
uranium, have been known for 
a considerable time. The former 



104 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was discovered by Jons Jakob 
Berzelius and named after the 
Norse god Thor, the latter by 
Martin Heinrich Klaproth and 
named after the planet Uranus. 

No. 91 is protactinium and 
above 92 we have the obvious 
neptunium (No. 93) and plu- 
tonium (No. 94) ; americium 
(“made in America”) as No. 95; 
curium (after Madame Curie) as 
No. 96 and, so far the heaviest, 
Berkelium (Berkeley, Calif.) as 
No. 97. 

As you can see, naming ele- 
ments is an arbitrary, inaccurate 
and often sentimental business. 
Luckily, the origins quickly lose 
their identities and we are aware 
only of the properties of these 
basic substances. And they did, 
after all, need some name and 
these do as well as any others.

ANY QUESTIONS? 

How would the pilot of a ship 
in space recognize Earth at a 
glance and could he tell his dis- 
tance, even roughly, by its bright- 
ness? 

Earth could be recognized by 
il8 color and by the presence 
of a single large moon. Mars, 
when seen from apace, looks 
rcdilish, Venus a pure white, 
while Earth must be blue-green. 
Saturn, of course, has its rings 
us a distinctive feature an<l 



Jupiter its stripes and four 
large moons. If the ship were 
at the orbit of Venus, Earth 
ran look six times as brilliant 
as Venus at her brightest ap- 
pears to us. Even the Moon 
would be almost as briglit as 
Venus is to ns. Seen frtmt the 
orbit of Mars, Earth would look 
about as bright as Jupiter does 
from Earth at greatest prox- 
imity. If the ship is at points 
outside the orbit of Jupiter, the 
pilot would need instruments 
to see Earth, whieli at such dis- 
tance would he “lost” in the 
glare of the Sun. 

Just what is the velocity of 
light? 186,000 miles per second 
sounds like a rounded-off figure. 

It is, and so is the customary 
metric equivalent of 300,000 
kilometers per second. The Oh- 
server’s Handbook gives the 
more precise value of 299,774 
km. p. sec. Some values oh- 
tainc<I in 1949 and 19.‘>0 by 
various investigators read as 
follows: 

Aslakson 299,792 -f 2.4 

Essen 299,792.5 + 3.0 

Bol 299,798.3 -f 0.4 

Bcrgslraml 299,792.7 + 0.25 

In your Conquest of Space you 
list the planetoid Adonis as the 
one wluch comes nearest to the 
Sun, staying just outside the orbit 
of Mercury. But since the orbit

of Mercury is so eccentric, isn’t 
it possible that Adonis might 
cross the orbit of Mercury on 
occasion? 

To tlie l>est of onr knowledge 
Adonis does not. Bnt we now 
know a male planetoid that 
does. It has In'en appropriately

or around 19 million miles. 
Maximum distance of Icarus 
from the sun is 1.97 A.U., 
^tighly twice that of Earth. 
More precisely, it is 183 million

there is a short sentence hinting 
at the use of titanium for space- 
ship construction. In what re- 
spect would titanium be superior 
to other metals? I have not seen 
it used anywhere. 

The rcustm why titanium is 
not in use right now to a no* 
ticeahle extent is simply due to 
the fact that it l>ecame com* 
mcrcially availahle only two 
years or so ago. I -have seen 



some small parts made of it. 
It looks like silver, though less 
shiny, and has generally the 
chnracleristies of stainless steel. 
It differs from steel in two re- 
spects of interest to an engi- 
neer — it is non*inagtietic, uml 
its specific gravity is only 4.5 
while that of steel is 7.8. Ilrin- 
Icin prohaldy picked titanium 
as a “light-weight steel” for 
construction purposes. 

Why is it that you get ice 
cubes faster if you put lukewarm 
water into the trays of your re- 
frigerator rather than ice water? 

If I had not l>cen prepared, 
this question would have sur- 
prised me no emi. But a few 
years ago I talked to one of 
the researchers of the Bureau 
of Standards in Wasliington, 
1). C., who told me that this 
is a fairly widespread popular 
siiperstilioTi and that the Bu- 
reau received so many im{iiirics 
alutut it that they finally de- 
rid«‘d to test it. I'he answer is 
astonishingly simple: hiM>aiise 
of the high latent heat of water, 
a few degrees more or less do 
not make a difference which

uring it. Of course, the cohler

Freudian Slip 



By FRANKLIN ABEL 

Illustrated by HARRINGTON 

Things ore exactly what they 
seem? Life is real? Life is 
earnest? Well, that depends. 



O N tiie day the Earth van- 
ished, Herman Raye was 
earnestly fishing for trout, 
hip* deep in a mountain stream in 
upstate New York. 



Herman was a tall, serious, sen- 
sitive, healthy, well-muscled 
young man with an outsize jaw 
and a brush of red-brown hair. 
He wore spectacles to correct a

alight hyperopia, and they had 
heavy black rims because he knew 
his patients expected it. In his 
off hours, he was fond of books 
with titles like Personality and 
the Behavior Disorders, Self- 
esteem and Sexuality in Women, 
Juvenile Totem and Taboo: A 
study of adolescent culture- 
groups, and A New Theory ol 
Economic Cycles; but he also 
liked baseball, beer and bebop. 

This day, the last of Herman’s 
vacation, was a perfect specimen; 
sunny and still, the sky dotted 
with antiseptic tufts of cloud. The 
trout were biting. Herman had 
two in his creel, and was casting 
into the shallow pK>ol across the 
stream in the confident hope of 
glutting anotherjf when the Uni- 
verse gave one horrible sliding 
lurch. 

Herman braced himself instinc- 
tively, shock pounding through 
his body, and looked down at the 
pebbly stream-bed under his feet. 

It wasn’t there. 

He was standing, to all appear- 
ances, in three feet of clear water 
with sheer, black nothing under 
it: nothing, the abysmal color of 
a moonless night, pierced by the 
diamond points of a half-dozen 
incredible stars. 

He had only that single 
glimpse; then he found himself 
gazing across at the pool under 
the far bank, whose waters re- 
flected the tranquil imagery of 



trees. He raised his casting rod, 
swung it back over his snoulder, 
brought it forward again with a 
practiced flick of his wrist, and 
watched the lure drop. 

Within the range of his vision 
now, everything was entirely 
normal: nevertheless, Herman 

wanted very much to stop fishing 
and look down to see if that hor- 
rifying void was still there. He 
couldn’t do it. 

Doggedly, he tried again and 
again. The result was always the 
same. It was exactly as if he were 
a man who had made up his mind 
to fling himself over a cliff, or 
break a window and snatch a 
loaf of bread, or say in a loud 
voice to an important person at 
a party, “I think you stink.” De- 
termination was followed by ef- 
fort, by ghastly, sweating, heart- 
stopping fear, by relief as he gave 
up and did something else. 

All right, he thought finally, 
there’s no point going on with it. 
Data established: hallucination, 
compulsion, inhibition. Where do 
we go from here? 

The obvious first hypothesis 
was that he was insane. Herman 
considered that briefly, and left 
the question open. Three or four 
selected psychoanalyst jokes pa- 
raded through his mind, led by 
the classic, “You’re fine, how am 
I?" 

There was this much truth, he 
thought, in the popular belief 



108 



GALAXr SCIENCE FICTION 



that all analysts were a little 
cracked themselves: a good pro- 
portion of the people who get all 
the way through the man-killing 
course that makes an orthodox 
analyst — a course in which an 
M. D. degree is only a beginning 
— arc impelled to do so in the 
first place by a consuming in- 
terest in their own neuroses. Her- 
man, for example, from the age o( 
fifteen up until the completion 
of his own anal3rsis at twenty-six, 
had been so claustrophobic that 
he couldn't force himself into a 
subway car or an elevator. 

But was he now insane? 

Can a foot-rule measure itself? 

Herman finished. At an appro- 
priate hour he waded ashore, 
cleaned his catch, cooked it and 
ate it Where the ground had 
been bare around his cooking 
spot, he saw empty darkness, 
star-studded, rimmed by a tan- 
gled webwork of bare rootlets. He 
tried to go on looking at it when 
he had finished eating the fish. 
He couldn’t. 

After the meal, he tried to take 
out his notebook and pen. He 
couldn’t.^ 

In fact, it occurred to him, he 
was helpless to do anythini that 
he wouldn’t normally have done. 

Pondering that discovery, after 
he had cleaned his utensils and 
finished his other chores, Herman 
crawled into his ‘tent and went to 
sleep. 



Burying the garbage had been 
an unsettling experience. Like a 
lunatic building a machine no- 
body else can see, he had lifted 
successive shovels-full of nothing, 
dropped the empty cans and rub- 
bish ten inches into nothing, and 
shoveled nothing carefully over 
them again ... 

rpiHE light woke him, long be- 
fore dawn. From where he lay 
on his back, he could see an in- 
credible pale radiance streaming 
upward all around him, outlining 
the shadow of his body at the 
ridge of the tent, picking out the 
under-surfaces of the trees against 
the night sky. He strained, until 
he was weak and dizzy, to roll 
over so that he could see its 
source; but be had to give up and 
wait another ten minutes until 
his body turned “naturally,” just 
as if he had still been asleep. 

Then he was looking straight 
dovm into a milky transparency 
that started under his nose 
and continued into unguessable 
depths. First came the matted 
clumps of grass, black against the 
light, every blade and root as 
clear as if they had been set in 
transparent plastic. Then longer, 
writhing roots of trees and shrubs, 
sprouting thickets of hair-thin 
rootlets. Between these, and con- 
tinuing downward level by level, 
was spread an infinity of tiny 
specks, seed-shapes, spores. Some 



FREUDIAN Slip

of them moved, Herman realized 
with a shock. Insects burrowing 
in the emptiness where the Earth 
should be? 

In the morning, when he 
crawled out of the tent and went 
to the bottomless stream to wash, 
he noticed something he had 
missed the day before. The net- 
work of grasses gave springily 
under his feet — not like turf, but 
like stretched rubber. Herman 
conceived an instant dislike for 
walking, especially when he had 
to cross bare ground, because 
when that happened, he felt ex- 
actly what he saw: nothing what- 
ever underfoot. “Walking on air,” 
he realized, was not as pleasant 
an experience as the popular songs 
WK>uld lead you to expect. 

Herman shaved, cooked and ate 
breakfast, washed the dishes, did 
the chores, and packed up his 
belongings. With a mighty effort, 
he pried out the tent stakes, which 
were bedded in nothing but a 
loose network of roots. He shoul- 
dered the load and carried it a 
quarter of a mile through pine 
woods to his car. 

The car stood at ground level, 
but the ground was not there any 
more. The road was now nothing 
more than a long, irregular trough 
formed by the spreading roots of 
the pines on either side. Shudder- 
ing, Herman stowed his gear in 
the trunk and got in behind the 
wheel. 



When he put the motor into 
gear, the sedan moved sedately 
and normally forward. But the 
motor raced madly, and there was 
no feeling that it was taking hold. 
With screaming engine, Herman 
drove homeward over a nonex- 
istent road. Inwardly and silently, 
he gibbered. 

Six miles down the mountain, 
he pulled up beside a white- 
painted fence enclosing a neat 
yard and a fussy little blue-shut- 
tered house. On the opposite side 
of the fence stood a middle-aged 
woman with a floppy hat awry on 
her head and a gardening trowel 
in one of her gloved hands. She 
looked up with an air of vague 
dismay when he got out of the 
car. 

“Some more eggs today. Dr. 
Raye?” she asked, and smiled. 
The smile was like painted china. 
Her eyes, lost in her fleshy face, 
were clearly trying not to look 
downward. 

“Not today, Mrs. Richards,” 
Herman said. ‘T just stopped to 
say good-by. I’m on my way 
home.” 

“Isn't that a shame?” she said 
mechanjcally. “Well, come again 
next year.” 

Herman wanted to say, “Next 
year I’ll probably be in a strait- 
jacket.” He tried to say it. He 
stuttered. “N-a-n-n — "and ended, 
glancing at the ground at her feet, 
“Transplanting some petunias?”

OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The woman’s mouth worked. 
She said, ‘‘Yes. I thought I 
might’s well put them along here, 
where they’d get more sun. Aren’t 
they pretty?” 

“Very pretty,” said Herman 
helplessly. 

The petunias, roots as naked as 
if they had been scrubbed, were 
nesting in a bed of stars. Mrs.^ 
Richards’ gloves and trowel were 
spotlessly clean. 

O N Fourth Avenue, below 
Fourteenth Street, Herman 
met two frightful little men. 

He had expected the city to be 
better, but it was worse; it was 
a nightmare. The avenues be- 
tween the buildings were bottom- 
less troughs of darkness. The bed- 
rock was gone; the concrete was 
gone; the asphalt was gone. 

The buildings themselves were 
hardly recognizable unless you 
knew what they were. New York 
had been a city of stone — built 
on stone, built of stone, as cold 
as stone. 

Uptown, the city looked half- 
built, but insanely occupied, a 
forest of orange-painted girders. 
In the Village the old brick 
houses were worse. No brick; no 
mortar; nothing but the grotesque 
shells of rooms in lath and a 
paper-thickness of paint. 

The wrought-iron railings were 
gone, too. 

On Fourth Avenue, bookseller’s 



row, you could almost persuade 
yourself that nothing had hap- 
pened, provided you did not look 
down. The buildings had been 
made of wood, and wood they re- 
mained. The second-hand books 
in their wooden racks would have 
been comforting except that they 
were so clean. There was not a 
spot of dirt anywhere ; the air was 
more than country-pure. 

There was an insane selective 
principle at work here, Herman 
realized. Everything from bedrock 
to loam that belonged to the 
Earth itself had disappeared. So 
had everything that had a min- 
eral origin and been changed by 
refinement and mixture : concrete, 
wrought iron, brick, but steel and 
glass, porcelain and paint re- 
mained. It looked as if the planet 
had been the joint property of 
two children, one of whom didn’t 
want to play any more, so they 
had split up their possessions— 
this is yours, this is yours, this 
is mine . 

The two little men popped into 
view not six feet in front of 
Herman as he was passing a side- 
walk bookstall. Both were dressed 
in what looked like workmen’s 
overalls made of lucite chain- 
mail, or knitted glow-worms. One 
of them had four eyes, two brown, 
two blue, with spectacles for the 
middle pair. Ears grew like cab- 
bages all over his bald head. The 
other had two eyes, the pupils

of which were cross-shaped, and 
no other discernible features ex- 
cept when he opened his gap- 
toothed mouth; the rest of his 
head, face and all, was completely 
covered by a dense forest of red 
hair. 

As they came forward, Her- 
man’s control of his body sud- 
denly returned. He was trying his 
best to turn around and go away 
from there, and that was what 
his body started to do. Moreover, 
certain sounds of a prayerful 
character, namely “Oh dear sweet 
Jesus,” which Herman was form- 
ing in his mind, involuntarily is- 
sued from his lips. 

Before he had taken the first 
step in a rearward direction, how- 
ever, the hairy little man curved 
around him in a blur of motion, 
barring the way with two long, 
muscular, red-furred arms. Her- 
man turned. The four-eyed little 
man had closed in. Herman, gasp- 
ing, backed up against the book- 
stall. 

People who were headed di- 
rectly for them, although showing 
no recognition that Herman and 
the little men were there, moved 
stiffly asidedike dancing automa- 
tons, strode past, then made an- 
other stiff sidewise motion to 
bring them back to the original 
line of march before they went on 
their way. 

“Olaph dzcnn Harm Rai gjo 
glerr-dregnarr?” demanded Hairy. 



Herman gulped, half-stunned. 
“Huh?” he said. 

Hairy turned to Four-Eyes. 
“Grinnr alaz harisi nuya.” ^ 

“Izzred alph! Meggi erd-halaza 
riggbord els kamma gredyik. 
Lukhhal!” 

Hairy turned back to Herman. 
Blinking his eyes rapidly, for they 
closed like the shutter of a cam- 
era, he made a placating gesture 
with both huge furry hands. 
“Kelagg ikrl odrum faz,” he said, 
and, reaching out to the book- 
stall, he plucked out a handful of 
volumes, fanned them like play- 
ing cards and displayed them to 
Four-Eyes. A heated discussion 
ensued, at the end of which Hairy 
kept For Whom the Bell Tolls, 
Four-Eyes took T he Blonde in the 
Bathtub, and Hairy threw the 
rest away. 

Then, while Herman gaped and 
made retching sounds, the two 
disgusting little men tore pages 
out of the books and stuffed them 
in their mouths. When they fin- 
ished the pages, they ate the 
bindings. Then there was a rather 
sick pause while they seemed to 
digest the contents of the books 
they had literally devoured. Her- 
man had the wild thought that 
they were blurb writers whose 
jobs had gone to their heads. 

The one with the four eyes 
rolled three of them horribly. 
“That’s more like it,” he said in 
nasal but recognizable English-

“Let’s start over. Are you Her- 
man Raye, the skull doc?’* 

Herman produced a series of 
incoherent sounds. 

“My brother expresses himself 
crudely,” said Hairy in a rich, 
fruity baritone. “Please forgive 
him. He is a man of much heart.” 
“Uh?” said Herman. 

“Truly,” said Hairy. “And of 
much ears,” he added with a 
glance at his companion. “But 
again, as to this affair — tell me 
true, arc you Herman Raye, the 
analyst of minds?” 

“SupFMosc I am?” Herman, 
asked cautiously. 

Hairy turned to Four-eyes. 
“Arghraz iktri ‘Suppose I am,’ 
Gurh? Olaph iktri erz ogromat, 
lekh— ” 

“Talk English, can’t you?” 
Four-eyes broke in. “You know 
he don’t understand, that cave- 
man jabber. Anyhow, yeah, yeah, 
it’s him. He just don’t want to 
so.*' He reached out and took 
Herman by the collar. “Come on, 
boy, the boss n waitin’.” 

There were two circular hair- 
lines oi glowing crimson where 
Hairy and Four-eyes had origi- 
nally appeared. They reached the 
spot in one jump. Hairy bringing 
up the rear. 

“But tell me truly,” he said 
anxiously. “You art that same 
Herman Raye?” 

Herman paid no attention. Be- 
low, under the two glowing circles. 



was the terrifying gulf that had 
replaced the Earth: and this time, 
Herman was somehow convinced, 
it was not going to hold him up. 

“Let go!” he shouted, strug- 
gling. "Ouch!” He had struck 
Four-eyes squarely on the flat 
nose, and it felt as if he had 
slugged an anvil. 

Paying no attention. Four-eyes 
turned Herman over, pinned his 
arms to his sides, and dropped 
him neatly through the larger of 
the two circles. 

Herman shut his eyes tightly 
and despairingly repeated the 
multiplication table up to 14 x 14. 
When he opened them again, he 
was apparently hanging in mid- 
space, with Hairy to his left and 
Four-eyes to his right. The visible 
globe around them was so curi- 
oudy tinted and mottled that it 
took Herman a long time to 
puzzle it out. Ahead of them was 
the darkest area — the void he had 
seen before. This was oval in 
shape, and in places the stars 
shone through it clearly. In 
others, they were blocked off en- 
tirely or dimmed by a sort of 
haze. 

Surrounding this, and forming 
the rest of the sphere, was an area 
that shaded from gold shot with 
violet at the borders, to an un- 
bearable blaze of glory at the 
center, back the \ifray they had 
come and a little to the right. 
Within this lighted section were 



FREUDIAN Slip 



ns 



other amorphous areas which 
were much darker, almost opaque ; 
and still others where the light 
■hone through diluted to a ruddy 
ghost itself, like candlelight 
tiirough parchment. 

Gradually Herman realized 
that the shapes and colors he saw 
' were ti>e lighted and dark hemi- 
spheres of Earth. The dark areas 
were the oceans, deep enough m 
most places to shut out tibe light 
altogether, and those parts of the 
continents, North and South 
America b^nd him, Europe and 
Asia ahead, Africa down to the 
fight, which were heavily for- 
ested. 

Herman’s earlier conviction re- 
Inmed. Things like this just did

*Tfou're not real,” he said bit- 
terly to Four-eyes. 

“Not very ” Four-eyes agreed. 
►I’m twice as real as that jerk, 
Hhough,” he insisted, pelting to 
Hairy. 

Ahead <rf them, or “bdow,” a 
point of orange light was slowly 
■welling. Herman watched it 
without much interest. 

Hairy broke out into ■ torrent 
ef cursing. '^I this and that in 
the milk of your this!” he said, 
►l this, that and the other in the 
tiiis of your that. Yovu* sister! 
Your cousin! Your grandmother’s 
ancle!” 

Four-eyes listened with awed 



approval. *^Them was good books, 
bah?” he asked happily. 

“Better than those scratchings 
ki the caves,” Hairy said. 

“Something to think about till 
they haul as out again. Well,” 
said Four-eyes philosophically, 
“here we are.” 

T he orange spot had enlarged 
into Ihe semblance of a 
lighted room, rather like a stage 
setting. Inside were two enormous 
Persons, one sitting, one standing. 
Otherwise, and except for three 
upholstered chairs, the room was 
bene. No — as they swooped down 
toward it, Herman blinked and 
looked again. A leather couch had 
appeared against the far wall. 

At the last moment, there was 
a flicker of motion off to Her- 
man’s left. Something that looked 
ike a short, pudgy human being 
accompanied by two little men 
the SHZC of Hairy and Four-eyes 
whooshed off into the di^nce, 
back toward the surface of the 
planet. 

Herman landed. Hairy and 
Four-eyes, after bowing low to 
tile standing Person, turned and 
leaped out of the room. When 
Herman, feeling abandoned, 
turned to sec where they had 
gone, he discovered that the room 
now had four walls and no win- 
dows or doors. 

The Person said, "How do you 
do, Doctor Raye?”

Herman looked at him. Al- 
though his figure had a disquiet' 
ing tendency to quiver and flow, 
so that it was hard to judge, he 
seemed to be about eight feet 
tall. He was dressed in what 
would have seemed an ordinary 
dark-blue business suit, with an 
equally ordinary white shirt and 
blue tic, except that all three 
garments had the sheen of pol- 
ished metal. His face was bony 
and severe, but not repellently 
so; he looked absent-minded 
rather than stern. 

The other Person, whose suit 
was brown, had a broad, kindly 
and rather stupid face; his hair 
was white. He sat quietly, not 
looking at Herman, or, appar- 
ently, at anything else. 

Herman sat down in one of the 
upholstered chairs. "All right/' he 
said with helpless defiance. 
“What’s it all about?” 

‘Tm glad we can c^e to the 
point at once,” said t& Person. 
He paused, moving his lips si- 
lently. "Ah, excuse me. I'm 
sorry.” A second head, with iden- 
tical features, popped into view 
next to the first. His eyes were 
closed. “It’s necessary, I’m 
afraid,” said head humber one 
apologetically. "I have so much 
to remember, you know.” 

Herman took a deep breath and 
said nothing. 

“You may call me Secundus, 
if you like,” resumed the Person, 



“and this gentleman Primus, 
since it is with him that you will 
have principally to deal. Now, 
our problem here is one of am- 
nesia, and I will confess to you 
frankly that we ourselves are to- 
tally inadequate to coi>e with it. 
In theory, we are not subject to 
disorders of the mind, and that's 
what makes us so vulnerable now 
that it has happened. Do you 
see?” 

A fantastic suf picion crept into 
Herman’s mind. “Just a mo- 
ment,” he said carefully. “If you 
don't mind telling me, what is it 
that you have to remember?” 
“Well. Doctor, my field is hu- 
man beings ; that’s why it became 
my duty to search you out and 
consult with you. And there is a 
great deal for me to carry in my 
mind, you know, especially under 
these abnormal conditions. 1 
don't think I’m exaggerating 
when I say it is a full-time job.” 
“Are you going to tell me,” 
asked Herman, more carefully 
still, “that this — gentleman — Ui 
the one who is supposed to re- 
member the Earth itself? The 
rocks and minerals and so on?** 
“Yes, exactly. I was about to 
tell you — ” 

“And that the planet has di»* 
appeared because he* has am- 
nesia?” Herman demanded on a 
rising note. 

Secundus beamed. "Concisely 
expressed. I myself, being. M

to speak, saturated with the 
thoughts and habits of human 
beings, who are, you must admit, 
a garrulous race, could not — ” 

“Oh, no!” said Herman. 

“Oh, yes,” Sccundus corrected. 
“I can understand that the idea 
is difficult for you to accept, since 
you naturally believe that you 
yourself have a real existence, or, 
to be more precise, that you be- 
long to the world of phenomena 
as opposed to that of noumena.” 
He beamed. “Now I will be si- 
lent, a considerable task for me, 
and let you ask questions.” 

Herman fought a successful 
battle with his impulse to stand 
Up and shout “To hell with it!” 
He had been through a great deal, 
bu^he was a serious and realistic 
young man. He set himself to 
think the problem through logi- 
cally. If, as seemed more 
than probable, Secundus, Primus, 
Hairy, Four-eyes, and this whole 
Alice - in - Wonderland situation 
existed only as his hallucinations, 
then it did not matter much 
whether he took them seriously or 
not. If they were real, then he 
wasn’t, and vice versa. It didn’t 
make any difference which was 
which. 

He relaxed deliberately and 
folded his hands against his ab- 
domen. “Let me see if I can get 
this clear,” he said. “I’m a nou- 
^enon. not a phenomenon. In 
•ruder terms, I exist only in your 



mind. Is that true?” 

Secundus beamed. “Correct.” 

“If you got amnesia, I and the 
rest of the human race would 
disappear.” 

Secundus looked worried, “That 
is also correct, and if that should 
happen, you will readily under- 
stand that we would be in diffi- 
culty. The situation is extremely 
— But pardon me. I had prom- 
ised to be silent except when an- 
swering questions.” 

“This is the part I fail to un- 
derstand, Mr. Secundus. I gather 
that you brought me here to treat 
Mr. Primus. Now, if I exist as a 
thought in your mind, you neces- 
sarily know everjrthing I know. 
Why don’t you treat him your- 
self?” 

Secundus shook his head disap- 
provingly. “Oh, no, Dr. Raye, 
that is not the case at all. It 
cannot be said that I know ev- 
erything that you know; rather 
we should say that I remember 
you. In other words, that I main- 
tain your existence by an act of 
memory. The two functions, 
knowledge and memory, are not 
identical, although, of course, the 
second cannot be considered to 
exist without the first. But before 
we become entangled in our own 
terms, I should perhaps remind 
you that when I employ the word 
‘memory’ I am only making use 
of a convenient approximation. 
Perhaps it would be helpful to

•ay that my memory ia compa- 
rable to the structure-memory of 
a living organism, although that, 
too, has certain semantic disad- 
vantages. Were you about to 
make a remark, Doctor?” 

“It still seems to me,” Herman 
Said stubbornly, "that if you re- 
member me, structurally or other- 
wise. that include* everything I 
remember. If you’re going to tell 
me that you remember human 
knowledge, including Freudian 
theory and practice, but are un- 
able to manipulate it, that seems 
to me to be contradicted by in- 
ternal evidence in what you’ve al- 
ready said. For example, it's clear 
that in the field of epistemology — 
the knowledge of knowledge, you 
might say — you have the knowl- 
edge and manipulate it." 

"Ah,” said Secundus, smiling 
shyly, "but, you see, that hap- 
pens to be my line. Psychoanal- 
ysis and psychotherapy, being 
specializations, are not. As I men- 
tioned previously, persons of our 
order are theoretically not cap- 
able of psychic deterioration. 
That is why we come to you, 
Dr. Rayc. We are unable to help 
ourselves; we ask your help. We 
place ourselves unreservedly in 
your hands.^ 

The question, "How was I 
chosen?” occurred to Herman, but 
he left it unasked. He knew that 
the answer was much likelier to 
be, "At random,” th«a, "BecaiM 



we wanted the most brilliant and 
talented psychoanalyst on the 
planet.” 

"I gather that I’m not the first 
person you’ve tried,” he said. 

"Oh, you saw Dr. Buddolphson 
departing? Yes, it is true that in 
our ignorance of the subject we 
did not immediately turn to prac- 
titioners of yoUr psychological 
orientation. In fact, if you will 
not be offended, I may say that 
you are practically our last hope. 
We have already had one eminent 
gentleman whose method was 
simply to talk over Mr. Primus’s 
problems with him and endeavor 
to help him reach an adjustment; 
he failed because Mr. Primus, 
so far as he is aware, has no prob- 
lems except that he has lost his 
memory. Then we had another 
whose system, as he explained it 
to me, was simply to repeat, in a 
sympathetic manner, everjrthing 
that the patient said to him; Mr. 
Primus was not sufficiently prolix 
for this method to be of avail. 

"Then there was another who 
wished to treat Mr. Primus by 
encouraging him to relive his past 
experiences: ‘taking him back 

along the time-track,’ as he called 
it; but — r Secundus looked 

mournful — "Mr. Primus has ac- 
tually had no experiences in th« 
usual sense of the term, though 
he very obligingly made up a num- 
ber of them: Our ontogeny, Dr. 
Raye, is so simple that h caa

CATcely be said to exist at all. 
i^h of us normally has only one 
unction, the one I have already 
nentimied, and, until this occur- 
ence, it has always been fulfilled 
;uccessfully. 

**We also had a man who pro- 
- oaed to reawaken Mr. Primus’s 
icmory by electric shock, but 
Ir. Primus is quite impervious 
■ o currents of electricity and we 
ere unable to hit upon an ac- 
:ptable substitute. In short. Dr. 
laye, if you should prove unable 
o kelp us, we will have no one 
.'ft to fall back upon except, pos- 
ibly, the Yogi.” 

“They might do you more good, 
it that,” Herman said, looking 
it Mr. Primus. “Well. I’ll do what 
I e^, though the function of 
analysis is to get the patient to 
accept reality, and this is the op- 
posite. What can you tell roe, 
to begin with, about Mr. Primus’s 
personality, the onset of the dis- 
mrbance, and so on — and. in par- 
icular, what are you two? Who’s 
your boss? What's it all for and 
iK)w does it work?” 

Secundus said, *T can give 
you very little assistance, I am 
afraid. 1 would characterize 
Primus as a very steady person, 
extremely accurate in bis work, 
but not very imaginative. His 
memory loss occurred abruptly, 
as you yourself witnessed yes- 
terday afternoon. As to your other 
questions — forgive me, Dr. Raye, 



but it is to your own advantage 
if I fail to answer them. I am, 
of course, the merest amateur in 
psychology, but 1 sincerely feel 
that your own psyche might be 
damaged if you were to learn the 
fragment of the truth which I 
could give you.” 

He paused. A sheaf of papers, 
which Herman had not noticed 
before, ley on a small table that 
he had not noticed, either. Secun- 
dus picked them up and handed 
them over. 

“Here arc testing materials,” 
he said. “If you need anything 
else, you have only to call on me. 
But I trust you will find these 
complete.” 

He turned to go. “And one 
more thing. Dr. Raye,” he said 
with an apologetic smile. *’Hurry, 
if you possibly can.” 

P RIMUS, looking rather like 
a sarcophagus ornament, lay 
limply supine on the ten-foot 
couch, arms at his sides, eyes 
closed. When Herman had first 
told him to relax, Primus had had 
to have the word carefully ex- 
plained to him; from then on be 
had done it— or seemed to do it 
—perfectly: 

In bis preliminary tests, the 
Binet, the Minnesota Multiphasie 
Personality Index and the Ber- 
neuter P. I., he had drawn almost 
a complete blank. Standard test- 
ing methods did not work on Mr. 



• ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Primus, and the reason was ob- 
vious enough. Mr. Primus simply 
was not a human being. 

This room, no doubt, was an 
illusion, and so was Mr. Primus’s 
anthropomorphic appearance . 

Herman felt like a surgeon try- 
ing to operate blindfolded while 
wearing a catcher’s mitt on each 
hand. But he kept trying; he was 
getting results, though whether or 
not they meant anything, he was 
unable to guess. 

On the Rorschach they had 
done a little better, at least in vol- 
ume of response. “That looks like 
a cliff.” Primus would say eag- 
erly. “That looks like a — apiece 
of sandstone. This part looks like 
two volcanoes and a cave.” Of 
course, Herman realized, the poor 
old gentleman was only trying to 
please him. He had no more idea 
than a goldfish what a volcano 
or a rock looked like, but he 
wanted desperately to help. 

Even so, it was possible to score 
the results. According to Her- 
man’s interpretation. Primus was 
a case of arrested infantile sex- 
ualism, with traces of conversion 
hysteria and a strong Oedipus 
complex. Herman entered the pro- 
tocol solemnly in his notes and 
kept going. 

Next came free association, 
and, after that, recounting of 
dreams. Feeling that he might as 
well be hanged for a sheep as 
a lamb, Herman carefully ex- 



plained to Primus what “sleep** 
and “dreams” were. 

Primus had promised to do his 
best ; he had been lying there now, 
without moving, for — how long? 
Startled, Herman looked at his 
watch. It had stopped. 

Scoring the Rorschach alone, 
Herman realized suddenly, should 
have taken him nearly a full day, 
even considering the fact that He 
hadn’t eaten anything, or taken 
time out to rest, or — Herman 
bewilderedly felt his jaw. There 
was only the slightest stubble. 
He didn’t feel hungry or tired, or 
cramped from sitting . , 

“Secundus!” he called. 

A door opened in the wall to 
his right, and Secundus stepped 
through. The door disappeared. 

“Yes, Dr. Raye? Is anything 
wrong?” 

“How long have I been here?” 

Secundus’ right-hand head 
looked embarrassed. “Well, Doc- 
tor, without bringing in the diffi- 
cult questions of absolute versusi 
relative duration, and the defini- 
tion of an arbitrary position — ” 

“Don’t stall. How long have I 
been here in my own subjective 
time?” 

“Well, I was about to say, with- 
out being unnecessarily inclusive, 
the question is still very difficult. 
However, bearing in mind that 
the answer is only a rough ap- 
proximation — about one hundred 
hours.”

Herman rubbed his chin. **I 
don't like your tampering with 
me,” he said slowly. “You’ve 
speeded me up — ^s that it? And 
at the same time inhibited my 
fatigue reactions, and God knows 
what else, so that I didn’t even 
notice I’d been working longer 
than I normally could until just 
now?” 

Secundus looked distressed. 
“I’m afraid I have made rather 
a botch of it. Dr. Raye. I should 
not have allowed you to notice 
at all, but it is growing increas- 
ingly difficult to restrain your 
fellow-creatures to their ordinary 
routines. My attention strayed, 
I am sorry to say.” He glanced 
at yie recumbent form of Primus. 
*‘My word! What is Mr. Primus 
doing, Dr. Raye?” 

“Sleeping,” Herman answered 
curtly. 

“Remarkable! I hope he does 
not make a habit of it. Will he 
awaken soon, do you think. Doc- 
tor?” 

“I have no idea,” said Herman 
helplessly; but at that moment 
Primus stirred, opened his eyes, 
and sat up with his usual vague, 
kindly smile. 

“Did you dream?” Herman 
asked him. 

Primus blinked slowly. “Yes. 
Yes, I did,” he said in his pro- 
foundly heavy voice. 

“Tell me all you can remember 
about it.” 



“Well, said Primus, sinking 
back onto tiie couch, “I dreamed 
I was in a room with a large bed. 
It had heavy wooden posts and a 
big bolster. I wanted to lie down 
and rest in the bed, but the bolster 
made me uncomfortable. It was 
too dark to see. to rearrange the 
bed, so I tried to light a candle, 
but the matches kept going 
out ...” 

Herman took it all down, word 
for word, with growing excite- 
ment and growing dismay. The 
dream was too good. It might have 
come but of Dr. Freud’s original 
case histories. When Primus had 
finished, Herman searched back 
through his notes. Did Primus 
know what a bed was, or what 
a bolster was, or a candle? How 
much had Herman told him? 

“Bed” was there, of course. 
Primus: “What are ‘dreams?’” 
Herman: “Well, when a human 
being goes to bed, and sleeps ...” 
“Bolster” was there, too, but not 
in the same sense. Herman: “To 
bolster its argument, the uncon- 
scious — ^what we call the id— 
frequently alters the person’s likes 
and dislikes on what seem to be 
petty and' commonplace subjects 
...” And "candle?” Herman: “I 
want you to understand that I 
don’t know all about this subject 
myself, Mr. Primus. Nobody 
does; our knowledge is just a 
candle in the darkness ...” 

Herman gave up. He glanced 



130

at S«cundus, who was watching 
him expectantly. “May I talk to 
you privately?” 

“Of course.” Secundus nodded 
to Primus, who stood up awk- 
wardly and »then vanished with 
a pop. Secundus tut-tutted regret- 
fully. 

Herman took a firm grip on 
himself. “Look,” he said, "the 
data I have now suggest that 
Primus had some traumatic ex- 
perience in his infancy which ar- 
rested his development in various 
ways and also strengthened his 
Oedipus complex — ^that is. inten- 
sified his feelings of fear, hatred 
and rivalry toward his father. 
Now, that may sound to you as 
if we’re making some progress. 
I would feel that way myself — 
if I had the slightest reason for 
believing that Primus ever had 
a father,” 

Secundus started to speak; but 
Herman cut him off. “Wait, let 
me finish. I can go ahead on that 
basis, but as far as I’m concerned 
I might just as well be counting 
the angels on the head of a pin. 
You’ve got to give me more in- 
formation, Secundus. I want to 
know who you are, and who 
Primus is, and whether there’s 
any other being with whom 
Primus could possibly have a 
filial relationship. And if you 
can’t tell me all that without giv- 
ing me the Secret of the Uni- 
verse, then you’d better give it to 



me whether it’s good for me or 
not. I can’t work in the dark.” 
Secundus pursed his lips. 
“There is justice in what you say. 
Doctor. Very well, I shall be en- 
tirely frank ’with you — in so far 
as it is possible for me to do so, 
of course. Let’s see, where can 
I -begin?” 

“First question,” retorted Her- 
man. “Who are you?” 

“We arc-™” Secundus thought 
a moment, then spread his hands 
with a helpless smile. “There are 
no words, Doctor. To put the case 
in negatives, we are not evolved 
organisms, we are not mortal, 
we are not, speaking in the usual 
sense, alive, although, of course — 
I hope you will not be offended— 
neither arc you.” 

Herman's brow wrinkled. “Arc 
you real?" he demanded finally. 

Secundus looked embarrassed. 
“You have found me out, Dr. 
Raye. 1 endeavored to give you 
that impression — through vanity, 
I am ashamed to say — but, un- 
happily, it is not true. I, too. be- 
long to the realm of noumena.” 
“Then, blast it all, what is 
real? This planet isn’t. You’re 
not. What’s it all for?” He paused 
a moment reflectively. “We’re get- 
ting on to my second question, 
about Primus’s attitude toward 
his ‘father.’ Perhaps I should have 
asked just now, 'Who is real?’ 
Who remembers you, Secundus?” 
“This question, unfortunately.

is the one I cannot answer with 
complete frankness, Doctor. I 
assure you that it is not because 
1 do not wish to; I have no option 
in the matter. I can tell you only 
that there is a Person of whom 
it might be said that He stands 
in tl>e parental relationship to 
Primus, to me, and all the rest 
of our order.” 

“God?” Herman inquired. “Jah- 
weh? Allah?” 

“Please, no names, Doctor.” 
Eecundus looked apprehensive. 

“Then, damn it, tell me the 
rest!” Herman realized vaguely 
that he was soothing his own hurt 
vanity at Secundus’s expense, but 
he was enjoying himself too much 
to stop. “You’re afraid of some- 
thilfg; that's been obvious right 
along. And there must be a time 
limit on it, or you wouldn’t be 
rushing me. Why? Are you afraid 
that if this unnamable Person 
finds out you’ve botched your 
job, He’ll wipe you out ©f ex- 
istence and start over with a new 
bunch?” 

A cold wind blew down Her- 
man’s back. “Not us alone, Dr. 
Kaye,” said Secundus gravely. “If 
tiie Inspector discovers this blun- 
der — and the time is coming soon 
when He must — no corrections 
will be attempted. When a mis- 
take occurs, it is — painted out.” 

“Oh,” said Herman after a 
moment. He sat down again, 
weakly. “How long have we got?” 



“Approximately one and a 
quarter days have gone by at the 
Earth’s normal rate since Primus 
lost his memory,” Secundus said. 
“I have not been able to ‘speed 
you up,’ as you termed it, by more 
than a twenty-to-one ratio. The 
deadline will have arrived, by my 
calculation, in fifteen minutes of 
normal time, or five hours at 
your present accelerated rate.” 

Primus stepped into the room, 
crossed to the couch and lay 
down placidly. Secundus turned 
to go, then paused. 

“As for your final question, 
Doctor — you might think of the 
Universe as a Pointillist paint- 
ing, in which this planet is one 
infinitesimally small dot of color. 
The work is wholly imaginary, of 
course, since neither the canvas 
nor the pigment has what you 
would term an independent exist- 
ence. Nevertheless, the artist 
takes it seriously. He would not 
care to find, so to speak, mus- 
taches daubed on it.” 

Herman sat limply, staring 
after him as he moved to the 
door. Secundus turned once more. 

“I hope you will not think that 
I am displeased with you. Doc- 
tor,” he said. “On the contrary, 
I feel that you are accomplish- 
ing more than anyone else has. 
However, should you succeed, as 
I devoutly hope, there may not 
be sufficient time to congratulate 
you as you deserve. I shall have

your normal world-line, for your 
absence would constitute as no- 
ticeable a flaw as tliat of the 
planet. In that event, my present 
thanks and congratulations will 
have to serve.” 

With a friendly smile, he dis- 
appeared. 

Herman wound his watch. 

Two hours later. Primus’s an- 
swers to his questions began to 
show a touch of resentment and 
surly defiance. Trans/erence, Her- 
man thought, with a constriction 
of his throat, and kept working

the stars out of its way ...” 
Four hours. Only three minutes 
left now. in the normal world. 
/ can’f wait to get any deeper, 
Herman thought. It’s got to be 
now or never. 

“You must understand that 
these feelings of resentment and 
hatred are normal,” he said, try- 
ing to keep the strain out of his 
voice, “but, at the same time, you 
have outgrown them — you can 
rise above them now. You are an 
individual in your own right, 
Primus. You have a job to do that 
only you can fill, and it's an im- 
portant job. That’s what matters, 
not all this infantile emotional 
clutter ...” 



He talked on, not daring to 
look at his watch. 

Primus looked up, and a huge 
smile broke over his face. He be- 
gan, “Why, of—” 

TTERMAN found himself walk- 
ing along Forty-second 
Street, heading toward the Hud- 
son. The pavement was solid un- 
der his feet: the canyon between 
the buildings was filled with the 
soft violet-orange glow of a sum- 
mer evening in New York. In the 
eyes of the people he passed, he 
saw the same incredulous relief 
he felt. It was over. He’d done 
it. 

He’4 broken all the rules, but, 
incredibly, he’d got results. 

Then he looked up and a chill 
spread over him. No one who 
knew the city would accept 
th%t ithyphallic parody as the 
Empire State Building, or those 
huge fleshy curves, as wanton as 
the mountains in which Mr, 
Maugham’s “Sadie Thompson” 
had her lusty existence, as the 
prosaic hills* of New Jersey. 

Psychoanalysis had certainly 
removed Mr. Primus’s inhibitions. 
The world was like a fence 
scrawled on by a naughty little 
boy. Mr. Primus would outgrow 
it in time, but life until then 
might be somewhat disconcerting. 

Those two clouds, for in- 
stance ...

his famous “Green Thoughts,” 
which appeared in the first sci-

for John Collier never wrote any 
in his life. It happens, however, 
that he is the most distinguished 
living writer of imaginative, fan-

only himself to blame for having

N ineteen stories, aii but 
four never anthologized be- 
fore; for 35 cents the buy of the 
month. All but three of the stories 
rate “B” or better, too; and it 
contains one nearly great (and 
quite unknown) tale, as well. This 
is called “Scanners Live in Vain,” 
and it is written by some pseudo- 
nymity known as Cordwainer 
Smith. It is one of the best tours 
dc force in science fiction. 

Another really magnificent tale 
is Fowler Wright’s quietly irre- 
versible comment on irresponsi- 
ble science, called “Obvious 
Suicide.” 

There are also top-grade tales 
by Kombluth, MacDonald, Lein- 
ster (he never fails!), Wyndham 
(alias both Harris and Beynon), 
MacCreigh, Finney (wonderful!), 
Bradbury (of course), Pearson, 
Clarke, Dryfoos, van Vogt, Gold 
(a delight!), Merril, and a com- 
pletely surprising tale by Hein- 
lein in collaboration with a lady 
named Wentz. 

A rich, juicy collection: Mr. 
Pohl is to be congratulated on 
having done it. Too bad he had 
to include these previously an- 
thologized items: Pearson’s “The 
Embassy,” Bradbury’s “There 



Will Come Soft Rains,” van 
Vogt’s “Letter from the Stars” 
(called “Dear Pen Pal” in its 
earlier book appearance), and 
Clarke’s “Rescue Party.” But 
even with these duplications, this 
is an unavoidable “must,” par- 
ticularly at the price.

I^INE stories by a gent who is 

' one of the very few so-called 
“humorists” in science fiction 
whose humor — at least most of 
it — is funny rather than plain 
silly. 

Previously collected: “Knock” 
(a good B-plus) ; “Nothing Sir- 
ius” (not one of the best; 
B-minus); and “Star Mouse” 
(delightful — a good A-plus for 
Mitkey Mouse!) 

. New in book form : “Something 
Green” (powerful alien-world 
tale, from which Heinlein bor- 
rowed the famous phrase, “The 
Green Hills of Earth”, A); 
“Crisis, 1999” (I didn’t much like 
this mixture of science fiction, 
sleuthing and pseudo-hypnotism; 
C-plus) ; “Pi in the Sky” (a gen- 
uinely brilliant, slap-happy satire 
on advertising ; a solid A) ; “All 
Good Bems” (witty but slight, 
a high-class B-plus); “Daymare” 
(serious tale involving a hypno-

tism helmet; A-minus); and last 
—and best, for my money — 
"Come and Go Mad" (one of 
the most superb “we’re property" 
stories ever written). 

A fine, high-spirited, fantas- 
tical, super-scientifical book for 
the human-hearted; a thing for 
padlocked shelves so people won’t 
be swiping it.

rw^HIS anthology has, as the 
saying has a way of going, 
everything — including 14 stories, 
of which nine according to my 
coi*it are worth preserving. 

There’s a pleasant introduction 
by Willy Ley; a 13-page “Dic- 
tionary of Science Fiction” that 
contains about 75 definitions (to 
pun slightly, definitely not a 
definitive dictionary) ; and a 16- 
page full-color section of BEMS 
(though Mr. G. insists they’re 
not any such thing) by Cartier. 

In other words, Publisher- 
Editor Greenberg has given us a 
really portentous volume here, 
full of miscellaneous apparati and 
whammies. The stories I like and 
think you will include: Keith 
Bennett’s "The Rocketeers Have 
Shaggy Ears" (Venus adven- 
ture) ; Christopher You<f i 
“Christmas Tree” (good Moon 



tale) ; Ray Bradbury’s com- 
pletely out of place "The Shape 
of Things" (it deals with a baby 
that was born “through” the 
wrong dimension and looked like 
a blue pyramid — a superb story 
having nothing to do with space 
travel); Lyle Monroe’s “Colum- 
bus Was a Dope” (Moon; this 
delightful snapper of a story is 
actually a double-snapper, as you 
will learn when you trace its ac- 
tual author’s name on the copy- 
right page; to give you a clue, 
the initials are R. A. H.) ; Hal 
Clement’s “Attitude” (about a 
planet of S Doradus, very cir- 
cumstantial, as if Mr. C. had 
really been there) ; William 
Tenn’s very pleasant but routine 
“Ionian Cycle” (all about weird 
• life) ; Robertson Osborne’s "Ac- 
■ tion on Azura” (splendid! — but 
already anthologized under the 
title of “Contact, Inc.”); A. E. 
van Vogt’s “The Rull,” (it will 
drive you nuts; very sticky — and 
very unforgettable — indeed) ; and 
Poul Anderson’s A-plus-plus 
“The Double Dyed Villians,” 
(about the Galactic government 
that keeps the peace’ solely 
through corruption — and justly 
»o. too). 

The other five talcs you may 
like, Buy the book and find out! 
I didn’t, but then I’m a sort of 
narrow-minded, combative cove, 
M everyone knows.

His voice oddly res- 
onant in the metal stillness of the 
spaceship, he looked through the 
forward port with an uncertain 
wonder in him. 

There was darkness outside, the 
great hollow night of space, and 
a thousand stars flamed cold in 
the brass frame of the port. The 



asteroid showed as a tiny pale- 
green spark that only a trained 
eye would have seen among those 
•warming bitter-bright suns. The 
quality of it was different, a 
muted reflection of the Belt's 
weak light instead of naked fire 
leaping across a universe, and it 
flickered a little as the irregular 
•tone spun on its axis. 

“Green,” said Hardesty again.

the note of puzzlement grown 
stronger. “I never saw that be- 
fore.” 

His wife shoved off from one 
wall of the cabin, her tall form 
weightlessly drifting past the glit- 
ter of control board to the in- 
struments mounted on the. f arthef 
side. 

“Shall we have a look?” she 
asked practically. 

Hardesty glanced at the meters 
and performed a mental calcula- 
tion : one had to be sparing of fuel 
on a voyage like this. 

“Yes, if the velocity isn’t too 
different from ours,” he said. 

Marian’s dark head bent over 
the telescope and her long, strong 
fingers spun a wheel, sighting oi> 
th? speck that flitted out among 
the ccnastellations. There was a 
faint sighing of gears above the 
murmur of air blown through S 
ventilator. It was quiet out ia 
space — so quiet. Hardesty’s pulse 
was loud in his own ears. 

He undipped a pencil from a 
pocket of his coverall and scrib- 
bled the figures she announcei 
on a pad clamped to the control 
board. When her readings were 
done, he took the slide rule froto 
its rack and manipulated it witti 
the easy speed of long practice. 
His gaunt frame hung in mid-aif. 
one foot hooked through llie ann 
of a recoil chair to keep him in 
place. 

The Gold Ru9h was moving 



outward from the Sun with a 
velocity known closely enough 
from his last astrogational read- 
ings. It was a fair approximation 
to assume that the asteroid’s mo- 
tion was at forty-five degrees to 
the ship’s path and its speed that 
to be expected of a body orbitit^ 
at this distance. Thus, from the 
observed transverse angular ve- 
locity, the separation could be 
estimated. It would take so much 
fuel to kill the ship’s outward 
vector — a deceleration of two- 
point-five Gs should do it in the 
allowed distance — and then you 
added ten per cent for maneuver- 
ing and landing. 

“Ifli-huh,” he nodded. “It’s all 
right, honey.” 

Marian swam into her chair, 
adjusted the webbing, and 
plugged in her throat mike. She’d 
be taking the reading while Har- 
desty piloted the ship, but you 
needed a comcircuit to talk and 
hear when the rockets were go- 
ing. 

His mind quit gnawing at the 
problem of a green asteroid and 
concentrated on the delicate job 
of working the ship in. Slowly, 
his whickering gyros swung the 
hull around. When the rockets 
started to roar, it was a thunder 
voice booming and crashing be- 
tween the vibrant walls, shivering 
the teeth in his skull, and weight 
dragged cruelly at a body grown

hit eyet hazed, the constellationt 
danced insanely through a sud> 
denly reddened sky, and then his 
trained reflexes took over and he 
watched the asteroid swelling in 
the rearview telescreen. 

They shot past it at a distance 
of ten miles, splashing the great 
dark with livid flame. Now it 
rolled in the forward port, and 
he notched the main switch 
ahead and felt his tissues groan- 
ing. Marian snapped out a string 
of instrument readings, and gyros 
whined as Hardesty brought the 
ship about, changing course, bear- 
ing down on the rock. They swung 
past it in a long curve. When it 
was centered on the cross-hairs 
of the rearview screen and could 
be held there, Hardesty backed 
down upon it. 

A typical piece of space debris, 
he thought. It was roughly cylin- 
drical, perhaps ten miles long and 
five thick, but the crags and 
gashes that scarred its surfaces 
made it a jumble of blackened 
stone. Here and there a patch of 
quartz or mica caught the thin 
sunlight in a swiftly harsh blink. 
The greenness was in patches, 
clustered on such hills and slopes 
as offered most Sun, but there 
seemed to be a delicate webbing 
—of veins?— connecting all those 
bunches. There were brown and 
gray and yellow mixed in. Like 
lichen, he decided, and his mind 
hearkened back to the cool, mossy 

•ARDEN IN THE VOID 



rocks of a New England forest 
and suddenly, almost bitterly, he 
wished he were there. 

The radar screen flickered and 
danced. Not much level ground, 
but he had landed on worse places 
without toppling his ship. Even 
if he did fail now, it would mean 
only the nuisance of rigging the 
derrick to lift her — a bump in 
that feeble gravity couldn’t hurt 
vessel or crew. 

A motor sang above the dull 
thutter of rockets and the landing 
tripod slid out around the tubes. 
Electronic valves glowed, radar- 
controlled servos adjusting the 
lengths of the three legs to 
the sloping, pitted surface. In 
the sudden ringing stillness, as the 
rockets went dead, the hull 
boomed and sagged. Shale gave 
way beneath one leg, but the 
•ervo lengthened it till its foot 
rested on solidity, and then the 
whole ship was quiet. 

Hardesty shook his head to 
clear it and looked across at his 
wife. Her thinly strong features 
smiled back at him, congratu- 
lating him, but no words were 
needed ; they knew each other too 
well. He unbuckled the webbing 
and stood erect. 

T he vision of the sky was like 
a blow in the face when they 
stepped out. He could spend 
a hundred years in the- Belt, 
thought Hardesty, and its eerie 

m 



unhuman magnificence would be 
«s cold in his heart as the first 
day he left Earth. 

The Gold Rush was not a large 
spaceship — a two-passenger Belt- 
boat with extraction and refining 
equipment, fuel and supplies 
enough for a year of cruising — 
but she loomed over their heads, 
a squat metal tower against the 
stars, dully ashine in the pale, 
chill light. Before them, a harsh 
raggedness of knife-edged rock 
swept to ^ horizon that seemed 
near enough to touch, the edge of 
forever lying beyond that wolf- 
jawed rim of hills. The ground 
was black, pits and craters and 
twisted frozen magma, dully lit, 
sl^dows like holes of blindness 
creeping over the rough slope. A 
tiny Sun, three hundred million 
miles away, glittered and threw 
a wash of dim, heatless lumi- 
nance. 

It was quiet, the blank quiet 
of airlessness and emptiness, the 
only noise that of the muted 
scrunch of footsteps carried 
through the spacesuits, only that 
and the hot, rapid thud of heart 
and breath. The sound of his own 
life was almost deafening in Har- 
desty’s skull, and yet it was the 
dimmest flicker in a room of 
night, a tiny frantic fist beating 
on iron gates of silence. 

And overhead wheeled the 
stars, the million suns of space, 
fire and ice and the giant sprawl 



of constellations, the Milky Way 
a rush of curdled silver, the far, 
mysterious glow of nebulae, huge- 
ness and loneliness to break a 
human heart. There went the 
Great Bear, swinging light-years 
overhead, and it was not the 
friendly neighbor of Earth’s 
heaven, but a god striding in 
flame and darkness, scorning the 
watchers, enormous and beautiful 
and cruel. The others followed, 
and the stars that Earth never 
sees threw their signals flawing 
and flashing across the years and 
the unthinkable distances, and 
no man knew what they were 
calling. 

Hardesty drew a deep breath 
and looked over to Marian. The 
declining Sun Hared off her space 
armor; a sheen on the helmet 
veiled her face from him. The 
armor depersonalized her and the 
voice over the radio was a me- 
tallic rattle. It was as if a robot 
stood at his side. 

He threw off the oppression of 
solitude and forced a calm into 
his voice: “Come on. let's take a 
look at one of those green patches 
before sunset.” 

*T think there’s one over that 
way.” She pointed north with a 
gauntleted hand. 

Hardesty had already located 
the asteroid’s pole star. He noted 
the position of the other constel- 
lations and set off after her. Ten 
years’ experience had taught him 






190 



3ALAXY SCIENCi FICTION 



how easy it was to get lost in 
such a jungle of stone, and their 
tanks only held air for a few 
hours. 

It was ghostly, bounding along 
in Utter syence, almost weight- 
less, between the high, dead crags 
and under the sharp stars. In all 
his time out here, Hardesty had 
not lost the ecriness of it. And 
yet Earth was blurring in his 
memory, green fields and tall 
trees and the feel of an actual 
wind, a low old house among a 
thousand shouting autumn coloi^, 
beat of wings across heaven — he 
couldn’t always conjure up the 
images. A blaze of naked stars 
would rise between. 

WtU, maybe here, maybe some- 
where else, this trip or next, wa’ll 
make the hi^ strike. Then we’ll 
go home. 

It was the great chimera. For 
every man who reached it, a hun- 
dred broke their hearts or left 
their withered corpses on some 
unknown frozen rock. 

Hardesty had been one of the 
luckiest. He'd made enough once 
to buy his own ship, and since 
that time enough to pay his costs 
and even save a little money. And 
he’d met one of the Belt’s few 
wo»i^n in an office on Ceres, and 
married her and made her his 
partner. 

How would Marian look at 
Earth? She'd never seen it. She’d 
been born on Mars. 

• ARDEN IN THE VOID 



The Sun sloped low as the as- 
teroid spun on its hurried, time- 
less way. Wan light glimmered 
off Marian’s armor as she topped 
a high ridge, pinning her against 
darkness and the scornful stars. 
Her voice was a sudden excited 
gasp in his earphones; 

“Jim! Jim, come quick 1“ 

He bunched his muscles and 
reached her side in a soaring 
bound, floating down and twirling 
a little like a dead autumn leaf. 
{Autumn, a maple scarlet against 
October smoke, and a leaf acrif- 
tling across the sidewalk!') To- 
gether they looked down the 
crazily tilted sheet of basalt to 
the seamed ledge jutting out 
against Orion. 

The green was there. In the 
airlessness, it was as sharp and 
clear as if it touched his helmet. 
Leathery domes, coiling vines, 
thick strong leaves — 

He breathed the word as if it 
were something holy: “Life.” 
“Life? But it’s not possible, 
Jim. No asteroid has life.” 

His answer was flat, and a sud- 
den coldness tingled in his hands. 
“This one does.” 

H e strode across the black 
slabs in the seven-league 
boots of Belt gravity. The Sun 
hung between two pinnacles, 
throwing a horned shadow across 
the acre of green. Hardesty knelt

I^asped one of the cactuslike 
leaves. 

It seemed almost to shrink, and 
in the vague tricky light he 
thought that a pulse ran from it, 
through the webbing of vines, and 
out of sight along the filaments 
that reached from this ledge. He 
drew back his hand and squatted 
there, staring. Marian came up 
and stood against his side. 

“I — ” Her voice was low now, 
trembling faintly. “I don’t know 
whether to — to be glad or inter- 
ested or — frightened, Jim.” 

His long-jawed face slid into 
the expressionlessness of uncer- 
tainty. "I know. We’ve gotten so 
used to thinking of the Belt as 
inorganic that — well, our enemies 



have been cold and vacuum and 
distance, impersonal forces. We 
really don’t know how to face 
something that could be actively 
hostile. And yet, that life could 
exist and evolve here a wonder- 
ful feeling.” He looked up to the 
stars as if throwing them a chal- 
lenge. 

“This can’t hurt us. Plants. 
You don’t think there could be 
—monsters here?” 

‘T wouldn’t mind a good hot- 
breathed dragon. But germs? 1 
suppose I’m being an old woman. 
But you know what they say 
about hold spacemen never be- 
coming old spacemen. They don’t 
live that long.” 

“How can any life exist here?

No water, no air, nothing — " 

“I don’t know. It’s obviously 
not terrestrial-type life, though 
I’m pretty sure it’s protoplasmic. 
It’s adapted to these conditions, 
that’s all.” 

Decision brought him erect 
again. “I suppose we should try 
to study this out, make analyses 
and so on, but we have neither 
the training nor the equipment to 
do so. We’ll take some pictures, 
and get an accurate orbit for this 
pebble, and report the whole mat- 
ter to Ceres. And we’ll scout 
around for minerals as usual, 
avoiding these green patches. Our 
work is risky enough without tak- 
ing even a tiny extra chance." 

"You’re righf.” Marian stood 




GARDEN IN THE VOID 



looking at the plants. They wert 
small and grotesquely ugly, but— 
"A garden,” she whispered. "A 
little garden, blooming out here 
on the edge of nothing.” 

“Come on.” said Hardesty. 
“Let’s get back to the ship.” 

Sun sank under the farther 
rocks and night was abruptly 
on them. Their flashlights cast 
dull puddles of yellow haze on 
the ground, where elsewhere 
there was a sea of black under 
the streaming stars. The sky’s 
light picked out the higher crags, 
etching them frost-gray against 
the dark, but the humans stum- 
bled in shadow, floating to the 
ground to continue their careful 
low-gravity shuffle back toward 
the ship. 

“I can’t forget it,” said Marian. 
“Those plants, blooming out here 
without air or heat or water — do 
you think that comets hover 
above them, Jim? Do you think 
their pollen is stardust?” 

“Don’t get poetic,” he grunted. 

In spite of their stellar obser- 
vations, they had trouble locat- 
ing the ship, approaching it 
finally from the other side. Thus 
they had walked around the mas- 
sive tripod before they saw the 
figure waiting in front of the 
gangway. 

Hardesty thought with a flash 
of disaT5pointmen.t that some 
Other prosector had beaten them 



133 



to it. He had come far out of 
the usual lanes, without revealing 
his course to anyone, to avoid 
just that; matching velocities and 
landing was so expensive that, by 
law, the first man to set down on 
a new rock held all mining rights. 
Then, as he looked closer— 

The space armor was awkward 
and bulky, a model which had 
been obsolete long before Har- 
desty left Earth, and its metal 
was patched and battered. There 
was no air-tank. A thick-leafed 
vine coiled around the square old- 
fashioned helmet, across the 
shoulders and down the back, 
like ivy on an ancient university 
building. Hardesty saw with a 
jolting shock that a tendril ran 
into the helmet, sealed by a 
cliJhisy weld, and that tiny root- 
lets veined the face inside and 
was tangled in among the man’s 
beard. 

The — man? 

Marian’s stifled scream was 
loud in his earphones; she 
clutched at Hardesty’s arm and 
they skipped back together. A 
dead man, a corpse, a revenatd; 
pupf»et of plants which grew 
where no life could be — 

“Who are you? What arc you?" 

The other took a floating stride 
toward them. His face was hooded 
in darkness; they could barely 
see the glitter of starlight in his 
sunken eyes. Hardesty stood 
.waiting, braced to meet the thing 



that neared him. The ship be- 
hind seemed infinitely remote. 

Metal hands clasped Har- 
desty’s shoulders and the square 
helmet leaned forward to ring 
faintly against his own. That 
close, the miner could sec the 
shaggy head inside, still veiled 
with shadow — a shattered grave- 
stone of a face with ivy creeping 
over it and reaching into the 
cracks. He fought down an im- 
pulse to retch. 

The voice that came was dim 
and slow: “You — from Earth?" 

“Yes and no. Who are you, 
man? What is that you’re wear- 
ing?” Hardesty’s mouth was dry. 

“My name? It’s — I am the 
gardener.” The stranger shook his 
big head, and the cactus leaves 
on his helmet rustled where there 
was never a wind to stir them. 
“No, wait. Yes, they called me, 
my name, yes . Hans Gron- 
aucr.” A throbbing chuckle. “But 
that was long ago. Now I am the 
gardener." 

“You mean you were ship- 
wrecked?" 

“Yes. How long ago? There are 
not years here. I think it was 
twenty EUirth years ago. That is 
a guess. It could be more.” The 
newcomer brushed a gauntleted 
hand over his faceplate, a 
strangely human gesture, as if he 
were trying to rub his weary eyes. 
“You will excuse. It is long since 
I talked. And my — my talker?— 



114 



• AlAXY SCIENCI FICTION 






Yes, radio. My radio was broken 
in the crash. I must talk this 
way.” 

“By helmet conduction? Yeah, 
sure. But — my God, man! That 
plant growing — growing on you 
like that — ” 

The tiny gleam of teeth in. the 
beard, the downcast eyes, it was a 
shy smile. “The plant gives air. 
So.” 

“So — oh.'” Marian had heard 
the words over her husband’s set. 
“Jim, of course, the plants re- 
lease oxygen and he’s used them 
•—Twenty years, Jim!” 

Turning his face, he saw the 
cold starlight gleam on her tear- 
streaked cheeks, and there was 
a sudden wrench of pity in his 
own heart. 

Twenty years' Twenty years 
alone in naked space! 

“Come into the ship,” he said 
urgently. He .didn’t think he could 
stand out here on twisted black 
stone with a million frozen suns 
jeering at him. “Come into the 
ship, man, and get some food. 
Twenty years! My God!” 

“No.” Gronauer didn’t shake 
his head, for that human gesture 
seemed forgotten, but he lowered 
his eyes. “No. Not yet, please.” 

“But—” 

*’■ “The garden would not like it. 
Not yet.” 

“The garden?” 

“World. We— don’t dare. Not 
till we know. It has been so long.” 



_"I think I see.” It was Marian 
again; Hardesty had never 
stopped wondering at the cool 
quickness of her mind. She wasn’t 
pretty, he supposed, but even on 
Earth he couldn’t have had a 
better wife. “He’s adapted in 
some odd way, or thinks he may 
have. He’s not sure he can stand 
conditions inside our ship.” 

“Yes. The plant might die.” 
Gronauer’s faded voice held a 
sudden eagerness. His vocabulary 
was coming back to him in a rush. 
“I must think this out. Come with 
me and let us investigate the 
problem.” 

“Come where?” 

“My home. It is safe for you. 
But — yes, bring food.” 

“You haven’t eaten?” 

“The garden feeds me. But for 
you it may not be safe — be safe 
for you yet. Come quick. Please.” 
“All right, if it isn't far. 
We have to watch our air supply, 
you know.” 

“The plants give air.” 

At the thought of tendrils 
around his head and roots going 
into him, Hardesty shivered. 
“No!” 

“I mean air is in my house. 
You can breathe there. It is not 
far from here.” 

“Very well.” Hardesty disen- 
gaged himself from Gronauer and 
thus ' from auditory contact. 
“Marian, fetch some canned 
stuff. And put my gun into a 



o 



GARDEN IN THE VOID 



13S

pocket. It’s in the toolbox.** 

“Gun, Jim?” 

“Yeah.” His voice was a little 
ragged. “Never thought I’d need 
it, but let’s not take chances. I’m 
not leaving you alone with him, 
cither. I’m pretty sure he’s harm- 
less, but you can’t tell. Twenty 
years! He’s not acting like a nor- 
mal human being. But who the 
hell would after living here like 
that for so long? Yes, I want the 
gun.” 

Wordlessly, she stepped up the 
gangway and disappeared into 
the airlock. Gronauer stood wait- 
ing, making no further attempt at 
conversation, and Hardesty was 
satisfied to keep it that way. 

The wonder of his discovery 
was lost in worried calculation. 
They could certainly not refuse 
to take Gronauer with them when 
they left, but his extra mass and 
the supplies he would need could 
upset the whole cruise. There 
wasn’t any outpost to take him 
to within some scores of mega- 
miles. So unless a decent lode of 
fissionable ores was found soon, 
he represented a heavy financial 
loss. Briefly, Hardesty wondered 
if he could leave Gronauer to be 
picked up by a government rescue 
ship. After all. scientists would 
want to investigate this place . 
But it’d make Hardesty an out- 
cast, being known to have aban- 
doned a shipwrecked spaceman. 
And he’d have to live with him- 

•ARDEN IN THE VOID 



self. No, he’d have to take Gron- 
auer back, whatever it cost. 

All he could do was hope that 
there was a lode on this asteroid. 
Gronauer would know about that. 

Marian came back, loaded with 
a sack of cans which Hardesty 
slung over one shoulder. Gron- 
auer set off at once. 

The path was dark, there un- 
der the ghostly arch of the Milky 
Way, but he picked his way with 
effortless speed. It didn’t seem to 
occur to him that the others were 
having trouble keeping up. Har- 
desty cursed and stumbled. He 
noticed that there was a leathery 
bladder on the castaway’s back, 
apparently part of the vine sys- 
tem. It glowed with the dimmest 
of red light. Heat? 

After a mile or two of bare 
stone, they entered a patch of 
growth that seemed to stretch in- 
definitely far on every side. The 
frailer vines and leaves shrank 
aside from the human feet, and 
subliminally faint pulses rippled 
through the garden and over the 
edge of the little world. Hardesty 
estimated that they came, in all, 
some five miles from the Gold 
Rush before reaching the other 
spaceship. 

It was a smashed ruin. Only 
the central part of the hull seemed 
intact, and that had been patched 
and welded. It lay in a small box 
canyon, against the low bluff at 
the farther end. The metal riba 

itr 



and the great broken tubes were 
scattered around it like raven- 
picked bones. And everywhere 
the steel was covered by green 
growth. 

Here the plants had become a 
thicket, vines swarming over the 
cliffs and wrapped about the 
gaunt crags, leaves and tendrils 
and looming fluted columns hid- 
ing the rock in a ghost-gray sea, 
stirring without wind and rustling 
without sound under the chill 
stars. Gronauer’s cabin was 
smothered *in the dripping life. 
Hardesty could not suppress a 
shudder as the leaves framing the 
airlock brushed him. 

Within the chamber there was 
a stifling darkness until Gronauer 
opej^ed the inner door, and then 
feeble light shone. It was lost 
again as frost condensed on the 
space-chilled helmets. Hardesty 
and Marian helped each other 
out of their armor, careful not to 
touch it with bare hands, and 
followed Gronauer into the room 
beyond. 

The miner’s first glance was 
for the castaway, now that he had 
removed his ivy-covered, battered 
old armor. His hair and beard 
were streaked with gray, and he 
smelled unwashed, though there 
was no grime on him. It was the 
face that held Hardesty’s gaze, 
the cryelly smashed face which 
had healed into lumps of scar 
tissue. It was pockmarked on 



cheeks and forehead, where he 
had gently pulled out the roots 
of the plant that still clung to his 
spacesuit. But the eyes were 
gentle, the mutilated lips curved 
in a timid smile, and he stood 
aside for his guests. 

The cabin was small, almost 
unfurnished, yet crowded. It was 
cold and the air had a musty 
reek. Plants covered wells and 
ceiling, made a springy carpeting 
underfoot, rustled and shivered 
as the humans walked across 
them. There were a lot of the 
red bladders twined into the 
leafage, and light came from 
countless tiny — berries? — things 
which glowed a dull amber ia 
the ^ay-green tangle. 

“It is strange to you, I sup- 
pose,” said Gronauer apologetic- 
ally. “But it keeps me alive.” 

Hardesty touched a bladder. It 
was warm under his hand. Yes, 
the plants heated the room and 
aired it and illuminated it and 
fed the owner. He had a sudden 
dark wonder as to just who owned 
whom. 

“It's like a dream,” whispered 
Marian. The unspoken thought 
ran on: A nightmare. A su/- 
realist's delirium. “Have you had 
this long, Mr. Gronauer?” 

“Yes. At first I ate the garden, 
but then I saw that, that way, 
one of us must kill the other, and 
if I killed it there would be no 
food for me. So I made friends 






in 



• ALAXY SCIINCI FICTION 



instead, and bit by bit the gar- 
den learned my needs and gave 
them to me.” 

As if exhausted by speech, Gro- 
nauer’s rusty voice faded out and 
he answered no more questions. 
Hardesty repressed a revulsion. 
After all, this was a wonder- 
ful example of human ingen- 
uity, the greatest Robinson Cru- 
soe story in the universe, and 
certainly the plants were harm- 
less. But he took out cans and 
can opener with the eagerness of 
a man clutching at familiarity in 
a strange land. 

“Shall we eat?” he suggested. 

Gronauer shook his head, smil- 
ing, when they offered him Bio- 
nate and one of their few,, 
cherished cans of beer. “I — ^have 
no taste for it,” he said. “It might 
even be dangerous. I will feed.” 

Carefully, he broke off one of 
the fleshy cactuslike leaves and 
chewed on it. He held a trailing 
vine to his face, and Marian 
looked away as the tendrils 
stirred hungrily and slid into the 
pocks. At least, thought Hardesty 
a little sickly, the plants did 
everything for him. Everything 
except furnish human companion- 
ship — and it didn’t seem as if 
Gronauer needed that any more. 

Not after twenty years. 

I T was surprising how much 
difference a full stomach made. 
Hardesty hadn’t really been 

GARDEN IN THi VOID 



aware of his own hunger till it 
was gone and strength was flow- 
ing back into his bloodstream. He 
sat down almost casually on a 
vine-begrown chair — there was a 
mossy plant intertwined, making 
a faintly warm cushion — and be- 
gan to draw Gronauer out in talk, 
That wasn’t easy: the castaway 
was too shy to do more than 
mumble answers while staring at 
his feet, but piece by piece the 
story was revealed. It was, in 
reality, quite simple. 

Gronauer had been only twenty 
or so when he left his native 
Germany for the Asteroid Belt. 
That was thirty years ago, when 
the mineral riches of the flying 
mountains had just lately come 
to the attention of an Earth in- 
creasingly starved for fissionable 
ores, and the great companies 
were outfitting expeditions. A 
ship which cruised among the 
scattered worldlets, refining the 
substances it located, could re- 
turn in a year or two to one of 
the asteroid cities with a cargo 
worth a good many millions of 
dollars. 

Hard, dangerous, and profita- 
ble work has always commanded 
high wages, and no few of the 
prospectors, Gronauer among 
them, had soon been able to buy 
their own ships and go out as 
independent operators. 

He’d had a partner — he 
couldn’t remember the man’s 

!»♦ 



name now — and they’d traveled 
and dug together for about hve 
years. As the most accessible as- 
teroids became worked out, the 
custom of not revealing one’s des- 
tination grew up. That way, if 
you found a rich group of plan- 
etoids, you could make several 
trips without competition — but, 
of course, if you met with an ac- 
cident there could be no rescue. 
Without ’more powerful radio 
equipment than a Beltboat could 
carry, there was no way to get 
help. 

Gronauer had gone north of the 
ecliptic plane, looking for one of 
the many groups which traveled 
in crazily tilted orbits. He’d 
found this green world and come 
wo^ieringly in for a landing. But 
the asteroid had a satellite, a 
meteor which had suddenly 
flashed over the horizon and 
crashed through the ship’s en- 
gines and sent it hurtling to its 
death. 

The other man was killed. 
Gronauer had escaped with brok- 
en bones and a smashed face. 
He’d lain near extinction for a 
timeless age; only the fact that 
tlic weak gravity made no de- 
mands on his body had saved 
him. After that, the only thing 
to do was to survive somehow 
and hope that another prospector 
would happen by. That could be 
within a year or never. It was 
safest to assume that he would 



leave his bones here. 

One man could live off the 
ship’s food stores perhaps two 
years. But there was life, the 
plants, food. Gronauer had had 
no means of testing for poison ex- 
cept his own metabolism. A few 
times he got sick but he learned 
what he could safely eat. Certain 
of the fleshy cactus growths were 
nourishing. 

He harvested all of them within 
five miles or so of his ship. After 
a few days — or weeks, or months ; 
he lost track — he’d gone out after 
more, and found that everything 
was dead in the area which he 
had exploited. And when -he cut 
some plants elsewhere and ate 
•them, he nearly died again. 

G ronauer was no biologist, 

but a spaceman generally 
picked up a good knowledge of 
science and so he had heard of 
symbiosis. It was clear that the 
plants were in some way inter- 
dependent, that each species was 
necessary to the survival of the 
whole. And in some dim way they 
had sensed the enemy among 
them and reacted with deadly 
swiftness.. Any type he tried to eat 
would soon become poisonous to 
him. Perhaps the garden would 
try something still more devastat- 
ing. An unnoticed root, growing 
between two plates of the 
wrecked ship that housed him, 
could split it open and let out 



140

the air in a great and fatal rush. 

With a quiet, methodical 
courage that Hardesty had to 
admire, he had given, himself the 
urgent job of studying the sym- 
biosis. He had no formal educa- 
tion in biology and almost no 
scientific instruments; most of his 
conclusions were guesswork from 
the sketchiest data. But given a 
year or two of patient slogging, 
and a good mind driven by a 
peasant’s deep, strong will to live, 
one could accomplish more than 
Earth's cold intellectuals would 
ever admit. 

He puz2led it out, observing 
and thinking in the huge loneli- 
ness of his world. The life here 
was protoplasmic, chemically 
similar to his own. It even seemed 
to involve photosynthesis of some 
kind. 

The tough skin of the “cac- 
toids” admitted ultraviolet light 
—intense in airless space, even 
this far from the Sun — while pre- 
venting the loss of water by 
evaporation. Instead, the water 
circulated through vine-systems to 
other species that used it in their 
own life-processes, and carried 
organic compounds manufactured 
by various types of plants to 
the symbiotic whole. The water 
was obtained from gypsum and 
other minerals by certain roots 
which added alcohol to prevent 
its freezing. Even so, the bitter 
temperatures would long a0o 



have turned it to ice, except that 
it circulated through the red 
bladders and these heated it with 
energy derived from fermentation 
or very slow combustion. The 
oxygen for that could also be 
cracked from mineral compounds 
beneath the surface. 

Cross-fertilization and the sub- 
sequent spread of life over the 
whole asteroid depended on spe- 
cialized vines. There even seemed 
to be hearts for this vascular sys- 
tem, slowly pulsing lumps of 
tissue scattered through the gar- 
den. A vast and unimaginably 
intricate network, each type ful- 
filling one of the many functions 
needed to maintain the whole in 
existence — 

A trained biologist might well 
have needed as much time as 
Gronauer to puzzle out the life 
cycle. 

“I still wonder if solar energy 
n enough to keep such a system 
going,” said Hardesty. “It takes 
a lot to break up minerals, you 
know, even if the symbiosis man- 
ufactures catalysts.” 

“We are as far from the Sun 
as we ever get,” answered Gro- 
nauer patiently. “The orbit is 
very — yes, very eccentric. I think 
the period is about seven years. 
At least we have three times 
come, I think, within the orbit 
of Venus while I was here. It gets 
hot then, special plants grow up 
to protect the others, and- energy

is stored chemically against the 
long cold which follows.” 

“I see. And with this highly 
tilted orbit, tlie asteroid hasn’t 
been discovered even when k 
was that close to Earth.” 

The poor ioy! Think of him 
Bitting here, watching the Sun 
grow and blaze, watching Earth 
swell to a blue brilliance and 
her moon visible beside her, and 
Still alone, still forever alone. 

“How did life evolve here?” 
wondered Marian. “You need air 
and oceans for that, and this 
asteroid has been dead rock since 
the beginning of time.” 

Hardesty shrugged. “We’ll 
probably never know, but I can 
make a guess. On some other 
world, maybe the world of an- 
othe? star, air and water disap- 
peared slowly enough for life to 
adapt. Certain sp>ores of that ^^fe 
were lifted on the last wisps of 
atmosphere up to where light 
pressure could drive them from 
that solar system. The old Arrhe- 
nius theory. They survived the 
trip. There were a lot of spore- 
clumps landing on many worlds, 
but this might be the only one 
in our system that had the con- 
ditions they needed for growth. 
Maybe not -- the spores could 
be the ancestors of all life on our 
planets, but I doubt it. Too com- 
pletely alien.” 

It was an eldritch thought, that 
tile garden had been seeded from 



across that gulf of space, that it 
was the child of a world millions 
of years in its grave, and that— 
perhaps, in the remote future, 
when all the planets were airless 
husks, gardens like this would 
bloom as the last defiance of the 
sunless night. He shivered in the 
chill must of the room. 

“Go on,” he said. “Tell us what 
you did.” 

Gronauer looked at him with 
gentle, frightened eyes. 

“Don’t be shy,” said Marian 
softly. “It is a great and won- 
derful thing you’ve done. You 
make me proud to be human.” 

“Human?” The short laugh was 
jarring. A vague rustling went 
among the leaves. “I am — hu- 
man?” After a moment, looking 
away: “Please to excuse. I have 
not been used to talking so much. 
1 will try.” 

T he words stumbled out, awk- 
ward, toneless, the words of a 
man who had begun by speaking 
German, changed to the English 
of the spaceways, and then not 
spoken at all except for the 
shadowy half-language of the 
garden. Hardesty had to hll in 
gaps; the Castaway could only 
hint at a reality too far from hu- 
man experience for communica- 
tion — but the outline grew. 

It had been plain that the sym- 
biosis was highly adaptable. It 
probably had to be, to survive 



142 



• ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the extremes of the asteroid's 
wildly swooping orbit. Gronauer 
thought, too. that the impact of 
cosmic rays, unshielded by at- 
mosphere, induced a hugh muta- 
tion rate: somehow, the garden 
weeded out unfavorable muta- 
tions and took those it could use. 
The pattern was not a rigid thing. 
It was constantly evolving. 

There even seemed to be a 
primitive brain somewhere. Not 
a human-type brain — there prob- 
ably wasn’t a nervous system as 
Earth knew it — but something 
had to control that change. Some- 
thing had altered the garden's 
metabolism and poisoned those 
leaves that the stranger ate. 

Probably it had tried various 
compounds from the beginning of 
Gronauer's attacks, until it hit cm 
this one. The man had harvested 
the deadly leaves and disposed 
of them with a terrible feeling of 
being watched. But that was ri- 
diculous — or was it? Was not the 
whole impossibly living world 
against him, ringing him .in and 
waiting for him to die? 

After a few weeks he ate again, 
experimentally, and was not sick. 
He’d foolAl the garden. Only it 
would keep on trying to kill him, 
and he would never know when 
it had made a successful attempt 
until too late. His one long-range 
chance of survival lay in making 
peace with the garden; and that 
could cmly be done by proving his 



potential usefulness to it. 

Digging around a patch of 
growth, he discovered that cer- 
tain thick roots went deep into 
the hard rock. Those must be for 
extracting buried minerals. Pro- 
toplasm required carbon and oxy- 
gen, among other things, and 
most likely the source of the form- 
er element was the various car- 
bonates. 

Gronauer went to an area 
where the plants had not yet pen- 
etrated and began to dig. His 
miner’s eye and brain were more 
effective than the chance grop- 
ings of the blind roots, and it was 
slow work for them, forcing their 
way into solid rock. 

Before long, he had a small 
heap of assorted carbonates. He 
macerated them and laid them 
beside one of the big roots. A few 
hours later, tendrils had grown 
around his offering and most of 
it was being absorbed. Limestone 
was a favorite, he saw, while iron 
compounds were hardly touched. 
He went after more limestone. 
And there were other elements 
they must need — sulfates would 
be especially valuable— and with 
the tiny atomic heater that re- 
mained to him, he could concen- 
trate nitrates. 

It took time for the garden to 
understand. There probably was 
no conscious mind reasoning out

a completely integrated ecology. 
By supplying minerals, by loosen- 
ing rock about new roots, by 
guiding tendrils in their direction 
of growth, the man performed a 
service, and the energy saved the 
whole system could go into pro- 
liferation — some of which would 
be new, “experimental” forms. 

W ITHIN a few months, there 
were pale leaves which 
seemed to be mostly protein. 
Gronaucr harvested and ate them. 
Presently there were no more such 
leaves. They had apparently not 
fulfilled a real function, and the 
symbiosis had cut them off. Gro- 
nauer stopped working for the 
garden. He waited, and the slow 
weeks passed, and his supplies 
from Earth got horribly short. If 
he had guessed wrong — 

No. The flesh-leaves budded 
out again. Gronauer rewarded the 
garden with a heap of limestone 
and copperas. Thereafter the 
leaves stayed. Whether it was 
blind natural selection within the 
framework of symbiosis, or 
whether there really was some 
dim brain capable of learned re- 
flexes, the garden adapted to the 
new fact that flesh-leaves meant 
free minerals. 

“After that,” said Gronauer 
simply, “we were friends. The 
problem was only to com — com- 
municate our needs to each 
Other.” 



He needed green food to pre- 
vent scurvy. An experimental 
teste made him ill, and again he 
withheld his services. Thereafter 
the garden produced more edible 
green leaves than it needed for it- 
self, and he gathered the surplus. 

It was to his advantage to have 
the garden change rapidly, so 
that new possibilities would arise. 
He rewarded each discovered mu- 
tation with an extra mineral ra- 
tion; if it turned out to be useful, 
he was lavish in his payments. 
Thus, over the years, he attained 
a remarkably balanced diet. 

Meanwhile, the plants had 
grown back around his ship, and 
he transplanted vines inside. They 
died, and he tried again, and still 
again, until he struck a variety 
that would endure the conditions 
he needed. They gave light and 
heat to replace his failing gener- 
ator, and proved to be much more 
efficient producers of free oxygen 
than the tanks of Martian sword- 
grass which was standard on 
spaceships. 

He had been recovering water 
by the usual condensing meth- 
ods, replacing losses by baking 
gypsum, but his nlw plants 
“learned” to give him as much 
alcohol-free water as he wanted. 
He could have had the alcohol, 
too, but he didn’t like to drink 
alone. And surely few men had 
ever been as lonely as he. 

“And all the time,” said Gro-

nauer, “I was trying other things, 
learning more about the symbi- 
osis. After a few years I got the 
— the feel of it. I have not the 
scientific words to describe, but 
I can understand in my own way 
what goes on. I can look at a 
patch of growth and tell what it 
needs. I can look at a mutant 
form and after a while know what 
it may do. By selecting new 
strains for several generations. I 
can create a species which will 
fit well into the symbiosis. It was 
thus I made the light-berries, for 
my own use, and roots which can 
use ferric carbonate — the symbi- 
osis could not handle that before, 
and limestone was getting short. 
And other things.” 

"The — well, your spacesuit? 
The air plant on it?” Hardesty 
felt embarassed at mentioning 
that. 

"My air compressing pump was 
going to wear out soon, I knew 
that, and by then it was more 
natural for me to work with the 
plants rather than dead machin- 
ery. The plants growing on my 
helmet, they give heat and light 
and free the oxygen out of my 
own breath. They live from my 
bloodstream. It is not ttiuch they 
need and they give me vitamins 
in return. Their rootlets entered 
my skin quite painlessly. 

“I have many kinds of food- 
plants now, with new tastes. You 
would like them, I think, but they 



are probably different from what 
you are used to. Go slow at first, 
eat only a little of the native 
food for a year, or however long 
your supplies last.” 

Hardesty and Marian did not 
stop then to consider Gronauer’i 
odd phrasing of the invitation. It 
wouldn't have meant much to 
them; in twenty years of solitude, 
anyone would develop a curious 
turn of speeth. 

Gronauer shuffled over to a 
desk, opened a drawer and took 
out an old logbook. Routine en- 
tries stopped with the shipwreck; 
what followed was page after 
page of fine script and painstak- 
ingly drawn illustrations. 

"Here are my notes,” he said 
with a humble pride. "I have de- 
scribed and pictured everything. 
It is all that you need to know.” 
Marian skimmed through it, 
and her thin intense features lit 
with a genuine glow. 

"It’s wonderful, Mr. Gronauer,** 
she said after a moment. "This 
marks some kind of epoch in bi- 
ology, you know. Your name will 
go down in history.” 

"Um, yes.” Hardesty forced 
himself back to the practical side 
of things. "Tell me, though, how's 
this world for radioactives? Any 
good deposits?” 

"A few deposits, but not worth 
working unless they have changed 
refining machinery a lot since my 
time.” 



GARDEN IN THE VOID

"They haven’t.” The spaceman 
sighed. "Well, it was just a 
thought. We might as well blast 
off, then. Our ship’s quarters arc 
rather cramped, Gronauer, but 
we’ll fix up the best we can for 
you." 

"For me?" The soft eyes wid- 
ened. 

"Of course. Did you think we’d 
leave you behind?” 

Gronauer shook his gray-maned 
head. "But I cannot go. I have 
to stay here. I am the gardener, 
you see.” 

■r|ARDESTY took a restless 
turn about the cabin. His feet 
fell so lightly in the low gravity 
that it was soundless; he drifted 
gh^st-fashion between the clut- 
tered instruments and controls of 
the Beltboat. 

“I don’t know what to do,” he 
said. “We can’t take him along. 
Imagine having a raving lunatic 
crowded in here with us for 
months. But, damn it, we can’t 
abandon him either.” 

“We won’t be abandoning him,” 
said Marian. “No one can say 
the situation is our fault. We’ll 
let the government know, and 
he’ll be all right till they send a 
ship for him.” 

“Even so, it’s the principle of 
the thing.” He stared out the 
port, at the hugeness of night and 
frosty stars beyond, barren rock 
and mute loneliness, and the pri- 



mal terror of it struck deep into 
him. “Leaving a man alone in 

thatr 

“He’s done all right for twenty 
years, dear. He can last one more. 
After that, it’ll be up to the offi- 
cial rescue party. We can suggest 
that they take a psychiatrist 
along.” 

“You had no luck persuading 
him?” 

“None at all. I tried every day. 
I went over to his place while 
you were exploring the asteroid 
and talked to him.” Wistfulness 
tinged her voice. “I told him 
about mankind and about Earth 
and summer moons and smoky 
hills in autumn, the way we’ve 
always dreamed it — I’ve never 
seen Earth, Jim, except in pic- 
tures, but somehow it’s more real 
to me than all this empty uni- 
verse. He isn’t interested. I had 
to quit when he started getting 
angry.” 

Hardesty went over and kissed 
her. “You’re a good kid,” he mur- 
mured. “Some day, some day 
soon, we’re going home to Earth. 
No more space for us. It’ll be 
roses growing over a house by the 
seaside.”.. His fists clenched im- 
potently.V'If only there’d been a 
strike right here on this damned 
lump! But I hunted everywhere. 
Not a thing worth digging out. 
Gronauer told the truth.” 

"Why should he have lied to 
us?”

‘‘I don’t know, except that he 
isn’t normal any more. He doesn’t 
react like a human being, even 
like a human who’s been alone 
that long. Those plants have done 
something to him.” Decision har- 
dened Hardesty’s lean face. 
•Well, he doesn’t get many more 
chances to come along. We’re not 
hanging around here another 
twenty-four hours. The sooner 
off, the sooner we’ll find that lode 
and go home to Earth.” 

“Yes, I suppose so.” Marian 
turned back toward the micro- 
scopic galley. “He’s coming over 
for dinner, you know. I talked 
him into that much, at least.” 
“Well, I suppose there’s no 
harm in it. Any special motive 
other than hospitality?” 

“Oh, we’ll make it as bright and 
cheerful as we can. Homelike. It 
may change his mind.” 

“I doubt that. But we’ll have 
done our best.” 

Hardesty glanced out the port 
again. The Sun was rising, a tiny 
brilliant disc winged witb the zo- 
diacal light. Its thin radiance 
crept over blackened lava and 
tumbled granite, seeming only to 
add to the ruinous desolation. 

M arian busied herself, get- 
ting the small luxuries they 
had saved for festive occasions 
out of the freezer, filling the ship 
with an aroma that made her hus- 
band lick his lips and grin. She 



hummed as she worked, and 
somehow the table she set was 
like a bit of Earth — the gleam of 
plate and silver, a centerpiece 
of flame*red swordgrass blooms, 
even the tiny porcelain dachs- 
hund that was their mascot. 

“We’re putting on the dog.” she 
explained solemnly. “Now you go 
dress, Jim.” 

He put on clean dungarees, 
knotted his one and atrocious tie, 
and slicked back his sandy hair. 
Marian had put on a print dress 
and dainty slippers ; she suddenly 
looked pathetically young. Har- 
desty wished with irritation that 
there was no guest coming, that 
this might be for the two of them 
alone. Briefly, he knew that 
they’d never really fit in on Earth, 
for something of the high, cold 
solitude had entered them and 
they were too self-sufficient and 
aloof. 

But that was a well-known psy- 
chological phenomenon. It was 
ooc reason why few prospectors 
went back till they’d made their 
pile and could live independently 
of society. Another was the diffi- 
culty, these days, of getting any 
land of decent job on Earth. 

It's not mankind we’re ^ing 
back to. We’ll have neighbors, 
but oar intimacy has become 
something that will never really 
let anyone else know us. It’s 
Earth we want, Earth and .clean 
wirtds and the tall trees above.

Sun and sea and sky. We want 
an environment that is home in- 
stead of deadly foe. We went the 
heritage of our race's evolution. 

The stars wheeled overhead, 
grand and lonely — he’d miss the 
sky of space now and then; he’d 
wonder at the dimness of con- 
stellations — but there’d be sum- 
mer around him, a whisper of 
leaves, the chirp of crickets and a 
firefly bobbing through the warm 
and sleepy dark. No more metal, 
no more tanked air and canned 
food and armored life — "they 
would have come to their king- 
dom. 

Harsh sunlight gleamed off the 
figure that approached. Gronauer. 
Hardesty sighed, pumped out the 
airttock and opened its outer 
valve. When he closed that again 
and opened the inner one, a 
breath of searing cold eddied from 
the figure which stood there. 

Gronauer climbed out of his 
suit and looked timidly around 
him. He had dressed in an old 
coverall given him by Marian. 
It didn’t fit well and he was ob- 
viously uncomfortable in it. For 
a moment, he shrank from his 
host’s welcome. 

“It is — warm in here,” he 
mumbled. 

“Sorry. Want me to lower the 
thermostat?” 

“No, please not to bother, I 
will get used to it. You were good 
to ask me.” Gronauer edged ner- 



vously into the cabin. 

“Sit down. Dinner will be ready 
in a minute.” 

'T cannot stay too long.” The 
stooped gray form placed itself 
on the edge of a recoil chair, as 
if ready to leap from sudden 
menace. “In here I am cut off. 
The garden might need me and 
I would not know.” 

“Isn’t that the case in your 
own cabin?” 

“No, no. There are roots grow- 
ing through the plates. My chil- 
dren inside are part of the whole 
system. I have sealed around the 
roots so air does not get out, but 
the garden can still call me.” The 
words were jerky, stammering a 
little, and the eyes were never 
still. 

“I noticed that every disturb- 
ance seemed to set up vibrations 
in the plants. Is that how they— 
communicate?” 

“Yes. Formerly, before I came, 
those were just special stimuli 
causing certain stereotyped re- 
actions. Like if a plant was hurt 
or killed by a rockfall, the vibra- 
tions triggered a reaction else- 
where, seeds were carried to the 
spot, a new plant was started. 
But after all these years, I can 
— read? understand? — more. Of- 
ten I know just what is wrong 
even before I go there. By sending 
my own pulses out, I can usually 
cause to be done whatever must 
be done, even without going

there to do the work myself.** 

“A sort of nervous system, 
then.” Hardesty rubbed his chin. 
“And now you’ve become its 
brain.” The thought was un- 
pleasant, somehow! 

Gronauer leaned forward ea- 
gerly. “And the eyes and hands, 
too. Many of the old functions 
> have died out because I do it 
quicker and better, so the garden 
needs me. It would probably die 
without me. That is why I cannot 
go with you.” 

“Soup’s on,” called Marian 
gaily. 

I T was mostly synthetics and 
dehydrates, but you wouldn’t 
have known it, for she was an in- 
spired cook. Hardesty dug in 
eagerly. Gronauer, though, only 
picked unhappily at his share. 

“I hope you like it, Mr. Gro- 
nauer,” said Marian, a little 
stiffly. 

His twisted face tried to smile 
an apology. “I am not used to 
such fare for a long time. Garden 
food tastes different. It feels dif- 
ferent.” He waved a hand inar- 
ticulately. “How shall I make 
^ clear? It is that you eat things 
you have no kinship with; you 
kill them and devour them with- 
out any emotion. But I am nour- 
^ ished by something of which I 
am a part.” 

Wryly, Hardesty’s mind wan- 
dered off on the subject of au- 



tophagy. Given perfect surgical 
tools, shockless and bloodless am- 
putation, how long could a man 
survive by eating parts of him- 
self? 

“At first I wanted to go back.” 
Gronauer’s tongue seemed loos- 
ened all at once. Perhaps the beer 
he was not used to had taken 
hold already. “It is strange to 
remember how lonely I was — oh, 
for years I wept because there 
was no one and nothing else. But 
now I see that it is you who are 
lonely, each of you alone in a 
world of dead metal, shouting 
at someone else you cannot even 
be sure exists, cannot be sure 
what he is thinking of you or 
even if he is thinking at all.” 

His grin was rather terrible. 
“How do you know you are not 
the only consciousness in a world 
of robots? Alone, alone, and you 
go to your grave and that is the 
end. But I belong. I feel the other 
life. It is part of me and I am part 
of it. My life has meaning and 
beauty — my life, married to other 
sensitive life, all of us together 
against the void. No, no, I can- 
not go back to Earth!” 

He lapsed into stillness, sat 
looking out of the port at the 
cruel brilliance of stars, and did 
not answer their remarks. Har- 
desty traded an exasperated look 
with Marian. 

“We’re leaving, you know, .Gro- 
nauer,” he said after they had

finished and were sitting in the 
recoil chairs again. “This is your 
last chance to come with us.” 
The gray, scarred head shook 
violently, so that the long hair 
swirled about the eyes. 

“I suppose you’ll make out all 
right,” said Hardesty. “We’ll plot 
an orbit that’ll get us to the 
nearest radio station — I think 
that’s Pallas right now — as soon 
as possible, and from there we 
can relay word to Ceres. It won’t 
be many months before a gov- 
ernment ship comes for you.” 
Gronauet shrank back and 
breath hissed between his teeth, 
“What then?” he gasped. 
“What will they do?” 

Despite himself, Hardesty was 
siffprised at the violence of the 
reaction. 

“Why, you have a legal right 
to stay here if you want, of 
course.” Unless the psychiatrists 
decide you're insane, his mind 
added grimly. “But there’ll be 
scientists to study your garden 
and your discoveries. There’ll be 
supplies and companionship — ” 
“I do not want it!” Gronauer 
stood up, trembling. “I have all 
I want. I am the gardener. Is 
that not enough? Do not tell them 
I am here. They would come and 
hurt the garden.” 

“Under the law, I can’t aban- 
don youi It’s all right to leave 
you, I guess, seeing th^t that’s 
what you want, but not reporting 



a shipwrecked spaceman? I could 
get in trouble for that.” 

"Who would know?” inter- 
jected Marian. She threw a wink 
at her husband over Gronauer’a 
shoulder. Soothe him, humor him 
till we’re away from here. “If you 
wish, of course we’ll keep your 
secret. It’s your right to stay here 
alone if you really want to.” 

“I want. I want!” 

“But think, Mr. Gronauer.” 
She smiled at him warmly. 
“Think of what that will mean. 
You’re getting old. You can’t live 
forever. You’ll die here and per- 
haps no one will discover this 
asteroid for centuries, or perhaps 
never. The garden will die with- 
out a human to attend it. If you 
let the scientists come, they’d 
preserve it as a natural wonder 
even when you were gone.” 
“They would not understand.” 
His voice was harsh and hostile. 
“The gardener must be part of 
the garden. He must grow into 
it, make it his life. Their scientific 
tending would not be enough.” 

I think, said Hardesty’s mind, 
that the old man is ri^ht. This is 
more than a mechanical set of 
duties to' be performed. You can’t 
replace a human brain with an 
electronic computer, even the best 
and latest model, even one which 
actually thinks. You can't replace 
the gardener with a paid atten- 
dant. Even if anyone would con- 
sent to live here alone, two or

three years at a time, for any 
wa^s. Could you be hired to let 
roots tap your bloodstream? 

’‘Then that’s that,” he said 
aloud, coldly. “The garden will 
last your lifetime, undisturbed.” 

O rion wheeled mightily 
overhead, a glitter of frozen 
fire against an iniinite clear dark. 
Gronauer sat still. There were 
trickles of sweat on his face, and 
he was breathing heavily.. 

Marian tried to break the em- 
barrassed silence: “It has been a 
great privilege to know you, Mr. 
Gronauer. And the garden. Was 
there anybody you once knew? 
Any message, perhaps?” 

“No,” he said abstractedly. “No 
one. Not any more.” 

After another minute, his eyes 
lifted to theirs with a kind of 
entreaty. 

“I have thought of this be- 
fore,” he blurted. “I am, as you 
say, old. There should be a race 
of human gardeners here, to carry 
on. The garden is still growing, 
still evolving. It needs men, and 
it gives them rewards you cannot 
now imagine. Would — would you 
think of staying here yourselves, 
having children here, too?” 

The thought was so grotesque 
that Hardesty had to laugh, « 
harsh sound jarring against the 
drumhead of tense silence. It 
seemed to strike Marian differ- 
ently. 



“Children,” she repeated. “Yes, 
Jim, we have to get back to Earth 
soon, while we can still be young 
with our kids.” 

“You could have them now,” 
said Gronauer. “Here.” 

“No. It isn’t fair to a child to 
raise it anywhere but on Earth. 
It isn’t right to grow up in metal.” 
There was something haunted in 
her voice. “I know. It happened 
to me.” 

“A child growing up here — ” 
The castaway’s words trailed off. 
He drew a long breath. “Would 
you come with me?” he asked. 
“There is something I would like 
to show you. It will change your 
outlook on all this. You will at 
least see why I want to stay here 
alone.” 

“What’s that?” E>espite him- 
self, Hardesty felt a resurgence 
of interest. 

Damn it, the asteroid was 
unique. 

“I carmot explain in words. 
You will have to see. It is not so 
far to go.” 

“Well—” 

“It is the last gift I can give 
you.” 

“Certainly weTl come,” said 
Marian. “We’ll be glad to, won’t 
we, Jim?” 

“Sure,” he said worriedly. He 
went to the spacesuit locker and 
opened it. “We’d better hurry, 
then. It’ll be sunset again pretty 
quick.” 



GARDEN IN THE VOID

**We will be following the Sun,** 
said Gronauer. He lumbered over 
to his own suit where it stood in 
the airlock. Briefly, his gnarled 
hands stroked the gray-green 
vines that draped it — an odd, 
wistful caress. 

Hardesty peeled off shirt and 
pants, revealing the insulated 
one-piece undergarment which 
served as padding below his ar- 
mor. Marian exchanged her dress 
for a similar outfit. It looked well 
on her slim figure. Hardesty 
smiled as he helped her into her 
suit. 

Gronauer donned his own ar- 
mor. He was still breathing hard. 
Something very odd here. When 
he was looking away, Hardesty 
alhbied quietly over to the tool 
chest, palmed his gun, and clipped 
it onto his spacesuit. Marian saw 
the gesture, started to say some- 
thing, and throttled her words. 
Maybe he was right. There was 
at least no harm in it. 

Or in Gronauer. He might have 
been a little crazy by normal 
Earth standards, but what did 
those mean out here, three hun- 
dred million miles frpm the Sun? 
But he was not violent; he par- 
took of the serene, timeless 
strength of the garden. A couple 
of hours’ jaunt was not too muctx 
to please an old man trapped in 
a loneliness he himself no longer 
recognized. 



T hey came out under a sky 
that was flashing ice and bitter 
dark, with a waa little sun low 
above ragged black stone. Gro- 
nauer led the way, a bounding 
figure of shadow and dazzling 
metal, now lost in a gully of 
night and now outlined gro- 
tesquely against the sprawl of 
stars. Hardesty swore at his 
speed, lengthened his own flat 
leaps, and felt rock and scree 
rattle beneath his boots. 

They were moving into the far 
bleak eye of the Sun, faster than 
the planetoid’s axial spin. As the 
stars reeled insanely backward 
and the Sun began to climb again, 
Hardesty had a sudden weird 
feeling that he was moving back 
in time. He choked it down and 
concentrated on picking his way 
through the jumbled, looming, 
crazily tilted stones, down riven 
gulches and up hillsides that were 
heaped slabs of igneous rock, a 
nightmare landscape of ruin and 
murk. 

It was a zigzag path, he no- 
ticed dimly, leading into an area 
he had only^ skimmed through 
in his search, but he was too busy 
keeping -up with Gronauer and 
watching Marian to think more 
deeply about it. His breath was 
harsh and loud in a suddenly hot 
spacesuit. 

The Sun was halfway down to 
the opposite horizon when Gro- 
nauer went into another ravine 



in 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and out of sight. Hardesty fol- 
lowed him, scrambled awkwardly 
down its steep sides, the undif- 
fused glow of his flash picking 
boulders out like distorted faces. 
The crack was long and deep; he 
had to fumble in shadow for sev- 
eral minutes before he came out 
at the other end. Then he looked 
around. 

He stood on a gigantic basalt 
block sloping off to the edge of 
the world, overhead and around 
him the stars and the rime-frost 
arch of the Milky Way, and he 
was alone. 

“Gronauer!” His voice echoed 
rattling in his helmet. “Where the 
hell are you?” 

Useless, of course. Gronauer 
didn't have a suit radio. But how 
the devil could he have gotten 
lost? 

Marian came leaping out of the 
ravine and over to stand by him. 
Her breathing was as hard as his. 

“What became of the old 
man?” she asked anxiously 

“That’s what I’d like to know. 
First he takes off like a bat out 
of Mars, and then he manages to 
lose us. Just went too fast? No, 
I was keeping up all right. He 
must have climbed the canyon 
wall ahead of me — I wouldn't 
have seen him — and taken off in 
some other direction.” 

“But why. Jim?” 

“I don’t know. He’s mad, com- 
pletely cracked, of course. Needs 



psychiatry in the worst way. But 
let the government worry about 
him. I’m fed up.” Hardesty took 
a long stride forward. “Come on, 
let’s get back to the ship.” 

“But he may just have made 
a mistake — ” 

“Then he can catch up with us 
and lead us properly. The hell 
with him.” 

“Well, he does seem a pretty 
hopeless case at that, doesn’t he? 
The poor old man! I hope we sec 
him again before we blast off.” 

Hardesty shrugged. “Person- 
ally, I don’t give a hang. Now 
let’s see, which way is the Gold 
Rush?'' 

“Why, I suppose — that way. 
Toward the Sun.” 

“We zigzagged quite a bit, re- 
member.” Hardesty’s hand rang 
against his metal leg in a slap 
of exasperation. “Nuts! We’re 
lost!” 

“There’s the asteroid’s pole 
star, up there, dear, and the Sun 
was west of it at setting, so our 
general direction should be that 
way.” 

“Yeah. I hope it’s not too gen- 
eral. Let’s go.” 

They set off along the sloping 
hillside toward a razor-backed 
spine of rock, black against the 
Milky Way. Neither one said 
anything. 

It was hard to orient yourself, 
if you didn’t know every inch of 
the path. You had to twist and

turn, picking a slow way across 
a narrow landscape of crags and 
gullies and craters, sometimes lost 
in darkness that was like a flow- 
ing liquid, sometimes blinded by 
the thin yet vicious sunlight di- 
rectly in your eyes. There were 
no broad outlooks. Vision was 
bounded on every hand. Only the 
turning sky had depth. 

Men had gotten lost on aster- 
oids and wandered within a few 
miles of their ships till their oxy- 
gen gave out. It was not a 
comforting reflection. Hardesty 
shoved it resolutely out of his 
mind. 

A fter an hour or so, they 
passed a region of plant 
growth. Hardesty looked at the 
stretch of garden with a rising 
bitterness in him. 

Low, silvery shrubs, lichenous 
growth spotting naked rock with 
red and brown and yellow, high, 
gaunt, yuccalike boles and gal- 
lows branches, sullen blood-crim- 
son glow of heat bladders, huge, 
muscular roots plunging deep 
into the little world’s iron heart, 
delicate faery tracing of vines 
looped and coiled between the 
shrubs, the throb and pulse of the 
garden’s beating hearts — a reach 
of growth over the hills and out 
of sight, a frigid world made 
alive where no life should be, 
supreme triumph of organism 
over the chaotic waste of the 



frozen and hostile Universe — 

But it was too alien. The 
eldritch forms only added to the 
strangeness and loneliness, and he 
hgted them. He kicked viciously 
and saw the pulse of alarm ripple 
out through the garden and over 
the near horizon, leaves rustling 
and whispering in the windless 
vacuum of space, the garden 
talking to itself. 

“Go ahead,” he muttered. “Call 
your brain. That’s all he is now, 
your brain and your hands. 
You’ve taken his soul away.” 

“Don’t, Jim,” said Marian. 
“Please don’t.” 

“Oh, all right.” He trudged in 
silence for a while before adding 
shamefacedly: “I’m being silly, 
1 know. This is nothing but an- 
other instance of adaptation. Life 
on Earth is interdependent, too, 
a balance of nature. But I still 
don’t like it.” 

The Sun crossed the sky again, 
and lowered behind them. Har- 
desty glanced worriedly at his 
wrist chrono. They’d been out for 
a good two hours; their tanks 
didn’t hold very much more air. 

Don't get excited. That speeds 
up your mefaboZ/sm, makes you 
burn oxygen all the faster, blunts 
the cool judgment you need. Take 
it easy. Slow and easy. Lots of 
time. 

Sunset, and darkness like a 
steel shutter slammed tight. 
Nothing around them looked fa-

and he squeezed it, grateful for 
the touch oi human nearness. 

“According to the stars, we're

as unemotionally as possible.

veiled the Stax'S, and flung an arm

spinning upward in the light 
gravity and bounced him against 
a lurching granite cliff, then 
tossed him back to the shaking, 
sundering rock below. 

“Marian!” he cried. “Marian?” 
The fire was gone, but half the 
sky was blotted from sight by a 
column of smoke and dust, climb- 
ing and climbing like a monster 
spirit let out of Solomon’s flask, 
and the ground shivered and rum- 
bled and boulders danced on its 
surface. Hardesty clung to the 
rocks, clawing himself into naked 
stone, and his own screaming was 
loud and mad in his cars. 

“Jim! Are you all right, Jim?” 
They stumbled toward each 
other, falling and struggling as 
earthquake waves raced around 
and around the tiny world. They 
locked arms and lay on the crack- 
ing ground together ,and looked 
wildly at the nightmare scenery.

miniature landslide came 
down a hill slope, slowly in the

slowness of fleeing through cling-

jinni which rose against the stars.

scattered to the horizon and be- 
yond, and the molten slag was 
still aglow beneath its resting 
place. 

“Gronauer,” he said, just that 
one word, but it held loathing for 
the castaway and for himself, 
the time and anxiety he had 
wasted trying to help someone 
who didn’t want to be helped, but 
mostly for his stupidity. 

Marian stared around. 
"Where?” 

‘‘Gronauer? I don’t know. He 
gave us the slip and came back, 
wrecked the safety controls and 
blew up the nuclear pile of the 
ship.” 

“No,” she said. ‘^He wouldn’t. 
It must have been a meteor.” 

“Not where I landed. A meteor 
would have had to come straight 
down to hit the ship. Even then, 
it wouldn’t blow up the pile.” 
He kicked savagely at a boulder, 
which flew off like a bird winging 
south. “Gronauer did it. You 
know that yourself.” 

“Why?” Marian’s whisper, like 
a dim voice from across that gulf 
of space that winked and jeered 
at him with a million hostile eyes, 
was so faint that even in his 
earphones he could scarcely hear 
it. '•Why?” 

They saw the figure lurching 
up the slope toward them, hands 
dangling empty, the helmeted 
head overgrown with vines like 
an ancient Greek nature god. 



Hardesty drew his gun and rested 
it on his free elbow for steadiness. 

“Jim! No!” 

“Calm down,” he said. “After 
what he did, Tm not taking any 
chances.” 

“Arc you going to — kill him?” 

“It’s not a bad idea. He’s in- 
sane, probably homicidal. We 
can’t watch him all the time. .” 

Gronauer must have seen the 
gun, but his slow pace did not 
slacken. One hand came up, ten- 
derly caressing the vine that 
trailed off his shoulder. 

Hardesty kept the gun level, 
but he did not fire, merely tensed 
his finger on the trigger when 
Gronauer suddenly broke into a 
staggering run toward them. Mar- 
ian gripped Hardesty’s arm. 

The old man fell over a rock 
and tried to get up. 

“First time I’ve seen him stum- 
ble,” Hardesty said puzzledly, and 
lowered the gun. “Come on. The 
worst he can do is heave some- 
thing at us. He’s unarmed.” 

Gronauer was still trying to 
crawl toward them when they 
reached him. He stopped and 
rolled over on one side to look 
up at them. Blood and foam and 
twisted Vines and tangled beard 
could not hide the smile on his 
battered lips. 

Tears glistened on Marian’s 
face in the keen starlight. Har- 
desty heard a sob in the radio 
and wanted to hold her close and

tell it wasn’t real, that it had 
never been real, and that the 
flamc-colored woods of Earth’s 
October lay just beyond the 
jugged, airless pinnacles. But he 
couldn’t. Instead, he knelt when 
Gronauer motioned him closer, 
and put his helmet against the 
castaway’s. 

“Now you will have to stay,” 
*aid Gronauer with feeble tri- 
umph. "I could not get away from 
the ship in time, but that does not 
matter. I am old and would have 
died soon. Then the garden would 
not have anyone to take care of 
it. Now it will.” 

“Killing yourself and maroon- 
ing us for the sake of some lousy 
vegetation,” Hardesty said bit- 
terly. *T should have known you 
were crazy and taken off right 
away and sent help back to you.” 

Gronauer tried to shake his 
head. “Not crazy. You will gather 
the supplies that were not de- 
stroyed in the explosion and move 
into my cabin. You will read my 
notes and tend my plants . 
and become part of the symbiosis, 
as I was.” 



“Td shoot Marian •and myself 
first!” 

“No, you will hope to be found 
by someone else. That hope will 
keep you from committing sui- 
cide. When you are ready to give 
up hoping, you will be — adjusted. 
You will like it here. This will be 
the home you were searching for; 
this will be your Earth. And you 
will have children — ” 

“So your damned garden can 
go on!” 

Gronauer nodded and his smile 
grew wider even while his eyes 
lost their focus. 

“The garden will go on,” he 
■aid. just before his breath ceased 
altogether. 

Hardesty stood up. Marian was 
clinging to hiin and her voice was 
insistent in his earphones, but he 
didn’t hear her. He wts looking 
at the stars, the bright stars which 
neither comforted nor mocked, 
being too remote to care, and the 
green of the plants in the distance, 
and be thought with a dull de- 
spair that even now it looked like 
New England in October.

Don't try to lake it from there. You can't possibly onticipote the complicationi, con-

Swiftly paced, rollicking, yet shrewdly thoughtful, FOUR-SIDED TRIANGLE is o real

h definition, o Utopia is on ideally perfect society. 

ftut . perfect according to whose standards? 

Plato's Republic was wonderful, except for slaves. Sir Thomas More's 
excluded non-intellectuals. Edward Bellamy's was a do-gooder's heaven, 
ambitious people not admitted. The late Mr. Hitler's was o dream of Prussian 
militarists, sure death for everybody else. 

So a Utopia, being o wishful state of mind, depends on who's doing the 
wishingl For example, whot would an advertising man's notion of Utopia 
be like? 

That, startlingly, is the theme of the serioi beginning in the June issue of 
GALAXY. It's a novel sparkling with the' incandescent ideas, the boiling 
ambitions and ingenious conflicts of the Hucksters of the Future! We can't 
say rush right out and buy o copy, because not until next month will you 
be oble to start .
