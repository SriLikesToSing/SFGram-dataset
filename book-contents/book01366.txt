Whatever happened to 




DMNETICS? 

In May 1950, a brilliant American writer, philosopher and 
Scientist shattered forever the myths and barriers surrounding the 
unknown territory of the Human Mind. 

L. Ron Hubbard’s Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health 
struck the English-speaking world like a thunderbolt. This best 
selling book heralded the breakthrough sought by Man for over 2000 
years, the discovery and identification of the source of psycho- 
somatic ills, human aberration, unhappy interpersonal relationships 
and the technique to eradicate it! 

Many promises were made. Man could rid himself of all unwanted 
emotions, conditions and aberrations. He could attain higher states 
of existence and ability only dreamed about for centuries. 

Man could be totally free. 

Today, all the promises have been kept.

DIANETICS IN 1950 

Dianetics was first announced to the 
public in a popular science fiction maga- 
zine in 1950. Without formal training or 
an organization, the superior technology 
in the first book made Dianetics tremen- 
dously popular. Informal groups mush- 
roomed all over the country and hun- 
dreds of thousands actively applied Dia- 
netic techniques with amazing results. 

Mental upset and psychosomatic ills 
vanished and miracles were commonplace. 

L. Ron Hubbard continued his re- 
search to improve the already excellent 
results from Dianetic technology and 
went far beyond. He created training 
methods far superior to existing systems 
and founded an organization to service 
the huge demand for the first truly work- 
able technology of the human mind. 

Finally in 1966 he completed his re- 
search on the full route to the state of 
CLEAR and TOTAL FREEDOM.

L. Ron Hubbard presents Scientology's 
GRAND NATIONAL CONVENTION OF THE 20TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF DIANETICS & TOTAL FREEDOM 

July 3rd, 4th and 5th at the west's most beautiful and mod- 
ern convention center, The LONG BEACH ARENA, Long 
Beach California. 

Here is the complete story of the tremendous growth of 
Dianetics and its evolution into Scientology, its amazing 
technology and the culmination of 20 years of “miracles 
beyond belief." Plan now to attend this event. 



DIANETICS TODAY 

Today we have Scientology (study of 
knowledge) which was the inevitable re- 
sult of L. Ron Hubbard’s advanced re- 
search into the mind. Scientology goes 
beyond the mind into the realm of the 
human spirit. 

Dianetics was only part of the answer 
and now, with Scientology techniques, 
Dianetics is 100% workable. 

Dianetics takes a person up to a well 
and happy human being. Scientology 
goes beyond to higher states of existence. 
Scientology is far more popular than Dia- 
netics ever was alone. 

Today hundreds of Scientology Cen- 
ters and organizations circle the globe 
and Scientologists number in the millions. 
Scientology doubles every year.

Readers write — and wrong! 

NOT EVERY knock is a boost. I have 
recently been compared to the dung 
under a camel’s foot and have had the 
curses of the Seven Blind Bastards 
evoked upon my head through the 
U.S. mails by a gentleman who ob- 
jects to my enjoyment of the techni- 
color variety of the human kind. And 
this is all right. It has pertinence to 
the current scene. I would rather be 
cursed by blind bastards than be one. 

We’re all having a hard time. But 
we could make it harder. The follow- 
ing is a good letter. 

It brings up the question of mean- 
ings. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

Galaxy has always been one of my 
favorite science fiction magazines (af- 
ter IFJ, and that’s why I am writing 
you today to express my disappoint- 
ment about the February issue. 

Actually you started out with a very 
good story. The Shaker Revival. Both 
my husband and / enjoyed reading it 
very much. But then we got to Dannie 
Plachtas The Last Night of the Festi- 
val. We thought it looked extremely 
interesting (something different for a 
change ) and started reading it with 
great anticipation. We stopped after 
about 6 or 8 pages because we did not 
want to waste our time reading such 
meaningless gibberish. I guess you 
call it fantasy, and / realize that it 
must take some talent to write this 



nonsense, but why not leave this kind 
of thing to the fantasy magazines? 

The other thing which irritated us in 
the issue was the comic strip. Heavens, 
I hope we wont have to put up with 
the kind of material boys in the sixth 
grade enjoy reading. I suppose it is an 
imitation of Playboy’s comic strip, but 
if it is, it is a very bad imitation in- 
deed. It lacks sophistication and the 
quality of paper Playboy uses. 

I hope you don’t mind my criticism, 
Mr. Jakobsson. I am writing you be- 
cause I care about the magazine. My 
husband and I have been reading it for 
many years and we want to continue 
doing so. 

Sincerely, 
Mrs. Victor Porguen 
Stamford, Conn. 

Dannie Plachta’s The Last Night of 
the Festival is a survival story. Dannie 
envisioned a race of humans, survivals 
of mutual abuse of each other, who 
had evolved into creatures capable of 
existing only in festival atmosphere — 
a happy twist on a sad scene. 

For me the story had significance — 
and not as fantasy. Its underlying real- 
ities are around us — as real as the 
camel’s foot and the seven blind Bs. 

Here’s a different view. 

Jakobsson: 

Bless you, bless you, bless you. And 
Jack Gaughan and Judy-Lynn Benja- 
min and all the other wonderful nuts 
behind what’s happening to Galaxy and 
If. The stories you print and the way 
you print them is a credit, big and bla- 
tant and beautiful, to you all.

B E THE first in your neighbor- 
hood to own your own person- 
al and private Stonehenge, think of 
the advantages. Neighborhood? 
All right, be the first in your state, 
continent, any continent. How 
would you like to be the sole own- 
er and proprietor of the one and 
only operative Stonehenge on the 
face of the earth? And the opera- 
tive word in this offer, friend, is 
operative, because this one works. 
Tell you what I’m going to do . 

My car was shot, Edie needed 
hers and I was in the subway, out 
of which I got at Harvard Square, 
the end of the line. It was hot and 
humid for almost the end of June. 
The subway filled with humanoid 
sardines hadn’t helped and I’d had 
a day of brutal frustration in the 
lab. I was looking forward to my 
air-conditioned house, a light sup- 
per and cold drinks. I stood on the 
curb for a moment and decided 
against a taxi. The green came on 
and we obediently crossed over to 
Nini’s Corner, where the familiar 
array of magazines caught my eye. 
God knew I had enough reading at 
home to catch up with, plus a 
bunch of reports in my briefcase, 
but Out There jumped out at me 
from the gaudy ranks and on im- 
pulse I bought it. I hadn’t heard of 
it before but it had an attractive 
cover. Spaceships. 

The streets became quieter as I 
walked from the Square. Nice

large quiet houses on Tory Row. 
One of them was mine and it was 
calling me like a beacon. The 
house was — not Edie exactly. I 
hoped she’d had a good day — 
sometimes that made a difference. 
The Earth had had a good day or 
a bad one, depending how you 
looked at it. I had realized in the 
subway that it was the twenty-first 
— which meant that at 3:15 A.M. 
the sun had entered the sign of 
Cancer, which meant that it had 
been summer for about fourteen 
hours, which meant that I was be- 
ginning to think of New Hamp- 
shire, which meant . 

I entered my lovely house like a 
hand going into a worn and com- 
fortable glove. 

“I’m home,’’ I called out, 
dumping the briefcase and hanging 
my coat in the closet. No answer. 
“Edie?” 

I found her on the terrace out 
back. She was reading something, 
had a tall drink to hand, looked up 
from her book. 

“Hi,” I said, tentatively. 

“Hi yourself. Everything’s 
there.” She nodded toward a table 
she had set up — ice, vodka, ver- 
mouth, a lemon even. “How did 
the boy wonder of MIT make out 
today?” 

“He had a vicious day working 
with modules that wouldn’t mod, 
circuits that wouldn’t circ. Bad. 
You?” 

I dropped Out There on the ta- 
ble by the chair and made a mar- 

IF 




tini. How to make a martini work 
I do know. Drink it. 

“So-so.” 

I sat there a moment, delaying 
the first sip, sat there looking at 
my wife. She was tiny — five feet 
one. Her hair was black and her 
figure was hard and muscular — 
but feminine as anything. Don’t 
get me wrong. She got her mus- 
cles from her work. She was a 
sculptor and I knew from a num- 
ber of sources that she wielded a 
respectable blowtorch. Her work 
pad was in an abandoned loft 
downtown. I’d been there several 
times and they had been bad times, 
as bad as when she had come to 
my lab in the computer center for 
a grudging look at what I was up 
to. She knew — and cared — as 
much about an electronic circuit 
as I did about her thing, whatever 
it was, and that was part of the 
trouble with us, maybe most of it. 
Plus she wasn’t getting the recog- 
nition she wanted. I’d had some 
lucky accidents in the lab — hence 
the boy-wonder crack — but that 
was no fault of mine. 

“Well,” I tried again, “how’s it 
going? What are you working 
on?” 

“You wouldn’t understand if I 
told you,” she said and I had no 
answer to that. I topped up her gin 
and tonic, made myself another 
martini and leafed through my 
magazine. It was quiet out there 
on the terrace, with soft distant 
traffic sounds now and then letting 

SECOND-HAND STONEHENGE 



me know I was still in Cambridge. 
I’d rather have been inside where it 
was cooler but Edie loved the ter- 
race and garden even in midsum- 
mer. “What’s that?” she asked. 

“Science fiction,’’ I said. “I 
picked it up on the way home. 
Nice cover.” 

I showed it to her and my artist 
wife turned up her nose. She rose. 

“We’re having a cold supper, all 
right?” 

“Of course.” 

“I’ll bring it out. It’s ready. It’s 
good, too, lobster salad. You want 
another martini first?” 

My glass was half full. I shook 
my head. 

“For a hot-shot electronic geni- 
us,” she said, leaving, “you do 
read the damndest crap.” 



“T ISTEN to this,” I said later, 
-■-'in bed. The supper had indeed 
been good. Edie had thought to 
chill a bottle of Pouilly-Fuisse and 
I and my house and my tiny wife 
were in a state of precarious har- 
mony. We had kept the conversa- 
tion out of danger areas, thread- 
ing through mine fields. I had fin- 
ished two stories in Out There , 
given them both Z?-plus, and was 
looking at the classified ads. “Lis- 
ten to this — do it yourself Stone- 
henge kit,” I read. “For the man 
who has everything. Five hundred 
bucks.” 

“You’ve got to be kidding.” 

“Not so.” I showed her the ad:

A Dd-It-Yourself Stonehenge 
Kit. For the man who has every- 
thing. A faithful reproduction of 
the Salisbury Plain original, 
though somewhat smaller. Best 
Vermont granite. Space re- 
quired: circular area 200 ' diame- 
ter, from which complete hori- 
zon should be visible. Limited 
supply, order now. $500 deliv- 
ered (E. of Miss.). Novel Prod- 
ucts Co., Box 201, Barre, Vt. 

Edie sniffed. “I suppose there 
are one or two people in the U.S. 
nutty enough to be taken in by 
that. What nonsense. Really.” 
“What’s wrong with having your 
own Stonehenge?” My mine detec- 
tors were beginning to hum faint- 
ly. “I’ve got plenty of room for it 
at Round Hill. I could put it on 
top of the hill, matter of fact. You 
know what a view that is. Full ho- 
rizon except for a wee bit of Mon- 
adnock — ” Edie looked at me 
aghast. “What have you got 
against it, for God’s sake?” I 
asked. “It’s sculpture, isn’t it?” 
Those words I shouldn’t have 
said — I should not have said them. 
They detonated the first mine and 
that was the beginning of a chain 
reaction which involved a plethora 
of words and drinks and eventual- 
ly found me at the desk in my 
study, writing a check for five hun- 
dred dollars. Not only that, I 
threw on some clothes and went to 
the box at the corner and dropped 
in the envelope, clanging the slot 



shut with a mighty crash. Satisfy- 
ing. On my way to the cot in my 
study I stopped by our bedroom to 
tell Edie I’d ordered a Stonehenge 
— but she was asleep. 

So next morning, coward that I 
was, I didn’t tell her. I tried to 
lighten things up at breakfast but 
Edie was glacial. She scathingly 
said, “Sculpture!” once, and that 
was about it. I was glad I wasn’t a 
hunk of metal awaiting her plea- 
sure in her studio. 

On the subway I thought about 
five-hundred-dollar Stonehenges. I 
could see my smaller version of 
Salisbury Plain brooding up there 
on top of Round Hill — I could see 
it, say, on a windy October night 
by the light of a waning moon. I 
could see it, all right, and if I 
could have it for five hundred I 
wanted it. Uneasy thoughts now in 
myrniind. How could Novel Prod- 
ucts do it for five hundred? Any- 
where east of the Mississippi? Mi- 
ami? This Stonehenge was smaller 
than the original, yes, but if it 
needed as much space as the ad 
said, that would be a lot of granite. 
To deliver that mass to Miami 
would cost more than five hundred 
for transportation alone. I reluc- 
tantly decided I’d been had. I called 
the bank from the lab to stop pay- 
ment on the check and got on with 
the business of being a boy wizard.

we are, I should say, but Edie just 
now is playing tennis at the club. 
I’m working the hell away in my 
study when I hear a bashing at the 
kitchen door. I confront a wiry 
redhead in overalls, holding in his 
freckled hand a piece of paper. 

“You Thomas Gridley?” he 
asked. I admitted it. “Then we’ve 
come to the right place. And a 
good thing, too. Where you want 
it?” 

“Want what?” 

He jerked his head toward the 
parking area behind the house. I 
looked over his shoulder. Merci- 
ful Jesus! Two enormous flat trail- 
ers loaded with granite — it looked 
like two million tons. I had time to 
wonder how soon Edie would be 
back from the club. 

“But — I stopped the check — I 
didn’t pay — ” 

I stepped onto the porch. The 
redhead handed me the bill of lad- 
ing or whatever that piece of paper 
was. It was stamped: Paid. So 
they’d made a mistake. 

So I had my Stonehenge. 

“It’s yours, buddy. Sign here.” 

I did. “You have the — manual?” 

“In the truck. So where do we 
put it?” 

“I’ll show you.” 

Let 5 get out of here now. 

“Follow me, Art,” the redhead 
said to the other driver. 

“Okay, Stan.” 

I sat in the cab next to Stan, di- 
rected him to the road through the 
north field to the edge of the 



woods. A jeep road led through 
those woods to the top of Round 
Hill but those trailers couldn’t be- 
gin to go through that. I’d have to 
haul those stones up myself, one 
by one. Some of them looked fif- 
teen feet long or more. I wondered 
if my four-wheel-drive jeep pickup 
could handle them. 

“Here,” I said at the edge of the 
woods. “As near as you can get to 
the road entrance but not blocking 
it, right?” 

“You’re the boss.” 

“The manual — you have it?” 

He handed me a bulky pliofilm 
envelope. I started to walk back to 
the house, then stopped. Do you 
tip the workmen who bring you 
your Stonehenge? Stan was manip- 
ulating the crane on the lead trail- 
er. I slipped him a five, another to 
Art, who was slinging cables 
around one of the stones. For a 
few minutes I watched Stan ma- 
nipulate those imposing masses. 
They bore neatly inscribed num- 
bers. I was glad of that — it gave 
me a sense of security. I went back 
to the study then, I wanted to read 
that manual. I was lost in it when 
Edie came back. 

“Any calls?” she asked. 

“No. No — calls.” The trailers 
must have unloaded and gone. I’d 
been so deep in the manual I 
hadn’t heard them go. As I hadn’t 
heard them come. 

“What are you looking so — sil- 
ly about?” 

“I’m not looking silly. I’m

working. How did the tennis go?” 
But she had already left. 

I STAYED up late that night, 
thinking about hauling that 
granite to the bald area on top of 
Round Hill. I kept wondering if 
the jeep could do the job. I 
skimmed all the way through the 
manual, knowing I’d have to read 
it again page by page, paragraph 
by paragraph. The charts and plans 
were elaborate. Novel Products 
had obviously done their home- 
work. 

I went to sleep wondering from 
whence had come the druid in my 
woodpile. I was conducting a sen- 
suous priestly rite when Edie 
shook me awake. She interrupted 
my rite, yes, and her touch held 
nothing of tenderness. The sun was 
well up; Edie was dressed. 

She got me somewhat awake, 
but I still wore ancient robes. I 
was not amused. It’s not every 
night . 

“Will you kindly tell me what 
the goddam hell is that pile of 
rocks at the edge of the field, will 
you?” Megatons of stuff coming 
at me from that five-foot-one bun- 
dle. “You bought that goddam 
Stonehenge bit, right? You stupid 
son of a — ” 

“Your invective is unoriginal,” 
I said, rubbing my eyes, my priest- 
ly robes fading. “Besides, I was 
dreaming. There was this priestess, 
see, and I was the priest and our 
robes were of many colors. We — ” 



“You silly bastard, will you lis- 
ten to me for one minute — ” 

“—and our robes were of many 
colors. You listen to me, baby, I 
bought it, yes, and it didn’t cost 
one nickel, not a cent. I ordered it 
last June, yes, but — ” 

I told her about the stopped 
check, their mistake, my Stone- 
henge for free. 

“That’s not the point, you 
doughhead, the point is — ” 

“Yes, ma’am?” 

“The point is I will not have the 
whole damn corner of the State 
thinking I’m the wife of the most 
eccentric weirdo this side of— of— 
anywhere. I won’t — ” 

After years of living with my 
tiny wife and sometimes loving 
her, caring about her, I understood 
in a nanosecond why she was no 
good with her junkyard iron and 
blowtorch and I felt sorry for her, 
I did. In that same microslice of 
time I knew that what was wrong 
between us was irreparable. Our 
prognosis was — negative. 

Edie left me not long after that. 
Round Hill had always been mine 
and I bought her half of the Cam- 
bridge house. She really didn’t 
want it, didn’t have the feeling for 
it I did. So Edie left me, left me to 
my house in Cambridge, to my 
Round Hill, to my haphazard pile 
of granite at the north end of the 
field. 

“It’s best,’’ she said and I 
agreed. 

Off she went — finally no fuss be- 

IF

tween us, only the sense and fact of 
finality. She walked to her car and 
I watched that little bottom for the 
last time. She didn’t turn round to 
say or wave goodbye. 

II 

1 MISSED my tiny wife in a way 
or two but I knew it was good 
that she was gone and those gran- 
ite monsters were coming on 
strong. The manual looked to be a 
good one. The charts were explicit. 

You ever put together a Stone- 
henge kit? You bet your life you 
haven’t. Tell you how it goes. 
First, you do a great deal of ex- 
tremely intricate measuring and 
surveying and, if your Stonehenge 
is to work, this must be done with 
impeccable accuracy. The outer 
circle of stones in mine would be, 
according to the plans, sixty-five 
feet and some inches in diameter — 
and the stones comprising that cir- 
cle would have to be placed within 
a tolerance of two inches. 

Then you dig holes, lots of holes 
in the ground, and you dig these to 
precise depths in precisely deter- 
mined locations. In these holes 
you stand monoliths, each of 
which must end up within two 
inches of where it’s supposed to be. 
And, don’t forget, all the tops 
must be level with each other. This 
generates within you a feeling of 
profound respect for some engi- 
neers who practiced their art in 
England thirty-five hundred years 



ago. Having breezed through this 
you come to the hard part, which 
is putting the lintels atop the mo- 
noliths. 

I wanted to get this project off 
the pad by digging one hole, haul- 
ing up one stone, setting it up — so 
I’d have at least the beginning of 
this construction to look at, enjoy. 
I knew I could dig the holes all 
right, no problem, and I didn’t an- 
ticipate trouble staking the layout 
— but when I cabled the first stone 
to the jeep and tried to drag it up 
the road I found I needed a crane 
and a big one at that. At the same 
time I realized I could also use 
some human-type help. I knew 
some girls — yes, a few girls I did 
know — but I didn’t know any girl 
crane operators, not even any girls 
willing to spend the summer dig- 
ging holes in the ground on top of 
Round Hill. A poverty of ac- 
quaintanceship. So I called Bill 
Crosby. Bill was a colleague at 
MIT. We were in the same boat — 
his wife had just left him — and I 
thought he might be at loose ends. 
He was. 

“You’re out of your cotton- 
picking mind,” he said at the end 
of our conversation, “but I’m 
’most as crazy as you are. I’ll be 
up day after tomorrow.” And he 
was. 

Bill was one of the more bril- 
liant lights at the computer center, 
and I liked him. We had written a 
few papers together. He was gi- 
gantic — six feet five with other di-

mensions to match — that massive 
figure belying the intricate brain 
within. It seemed appropriate he 
should help me with my megalithic 
enterprise. 

We drove into Keene and I per- 
suaded a construction outfit to 
rent me a crane capable of lifting 
weights up to fifteen tons. People 
are always moving granite around 
in New Hampshire. They didn’t 
ask questions, except did I know 
how to operate one. I lied that I 
did — I knew Bill and I could figure 
it out in ten minutes of trial and 
error — and they said they’d deliver 
one in a week or ten days. Good. 

That night we cut stakes and the 
next day we drove the jeep to the 
plateau-like summit of the Hill. 
We walked about for a time like 
dowsers clutching apple twigs and 
finally I drove a stake into the 
ground at what seemed to me the 
uniquely proper focal point of the 
one and only Stonehenge this side 
of Salisbury Plain. This wasn’t in 
the center of that lonesome space 
but somewhat to the southwest — 
we had to leave room for the heel 
stone, which would be out to the 
northeast, more than a hundred 
feet outside the sarsen circle. 

I had a beautiful theodolite at 
Round Hill, a reminder of when 
we had built the tennis court. It 
was an uncanny pleasure, erotic al- 
most, to go to work with that 
gleaming instrument, a compass 
and a glistening tape, to lay out 
the plan, measure the feet. The 

12 



inches. We drove the last stake 
just before sunset the following 
day. In time those markers would 
be replaced by somber granitic 
masses but just the stakes, stand- 
ing silently in that cryptic configu- 
ration, said something that tingled 
my spine. I couldn’t decode it but 
I got a message. So did Bill. 

“This is going to be the hell of a 
place with the stones in,’’ he said. 
“The stakes alone give me the will- 
ies. It’s getting dark — let’s go.’’ 

We did. 

W E DIDN’T have a computer 
handy and theliouse phone 
wasn’t an instrument that could be 
tied into the Center, so we did our 
operations research verbally over a 
few drinks. We decided we’d dig 
holes until the crane came, then — I 
wanted it this way and Bill went 
along — we’d haul up and erect one 
stone. I did want that. Then we’d 
finish the scut work of digging the 
other holes and carry the remain- 
ing seventy-five stones up one by 
one, erecting them as we did so. I 
wanted to do the sarsen circle first, 
saving the big trilithons for last — 
but if we did that we couldn’t get 
the crane back outside when we’d 
finished. We decided to build two 
thirds of the sarsen circle, erect the 
trilithons within, then close it up. 
We could put up the heel stone any 
time. 

- So we dug holes until the crane 
arrived. The stakes disappeared, 
were replaced by rectangular holes 

IF 




in the ground. I had thought this 
would be dull work and it was — 
until we had dug enough so the 
configuration reappeared, now in 
reverse, intaglio, more impressive, 
the cavities suggesting in their re- 
ceptiveness the upward thrust of 
the monoliths to come. 

Then came the crane — on a thir- 
ty-two-wheel trailer. I showed 
where they should put it at the 
north end of the field. I signed a 
piece of paper, ignored the crane 
until that trailer was out of there. 
Then we walked round it. 

“You don’t know how to work 
this, right?” Bill said, we circling 
the thing. 

“Right,” I said. “But we bright 
boys — we can learn, right?” 

“Right. Big, ain’t she?” 

“Big. Go up the road with the 
boom low, though.” 

“Right. You want to sit up 
there in that cab, Tom, boy and 
start turning things on and off, 
moving levers this way and that?” 
“Right,” I said. We were, re- 
member, masters of intricate com- 
puters and this crane was a tinker- 
toy. The total bank of controls and 
levers couldn’t have represented 
more than a hundred bits of infor- 
mation, and we dealt every day 
with millions. “Right,” I said, 
climbing into the cab. 

“For Chrissake,” Bill was howl- 
ing, some five traumatic minutes 
later, “not that lever again, you 
baboon, the one on the right! 

I had narrowly missed decapita- 



ting him with the boom and he had 
taken offense. 

“All right, goddam, if you think 
you can do any better — be my 
guest.” 

I idled the deep-throated motor 
and clambered down to terra 
firma. Bill climbed up and as- 
sumed the operating position. It 
was a sight to see. Those massive 
hands fondled the controls like an 
organist looking for the lost chord 
but not pushing any keys down. 

“It won’t play unless you give it 
some input,” I yelled. 

Bill confidently thrust a lever 
forward. I darted out of the way in 
time — just — to avoid untimely 
sacrifice at the feet of caterpillar 
treads. Now we were both shook 
up. I’ll skip the dialogue but let 
the record show that we mastered 
inhuman devil. Not in five or 
x. mutes, no, but in two or 
three hours. Without injury, too, 
except to our professional vanity, 
our presumed sense of the mastery 
of mechanisms. That came hard. 

The stone nearest the road en- 
trance was number four of the sar- 
sen circle. We cabled it, got it up 
there — taking turns back-seat- 
driving the crane — and erected it. 
When the monolith was up, stand- 
ing there alone, it was a sight. All 
those gaping holes in the ground, 
one now filled — that lonesome 
stone standing there on the plateau 
top of Round Hill, which had not 
seen such a thing before. Nor had 
we. Sobering. The theodolite said 

13 



SECOND-HAND STONEHENGE 




we were right on the money, within 
half-inch tolerance. 

And that was the way of that 
summer. There we were, two men 
without our women, and there 
were all those stones and a thing 
to be built and we built it. Not all 
of it, not that summer, but most 
of it. Some days we erected two of 
those monsters but usually just 
one. There were, of course, a few 
trips to Cambridge. I wasn’t used 
to the absence of my tiny wife. 
Though her not being there 
brought a sense of freedom, I 
learned something of deprivation. 
In consequence I made a few trips 
to town despite the pull of the 
stones, the monument. These di- 
versionary days came on pleasant- 
ly enough but with an underlying 
sense of mistaken identity and in 
the end I devoted the time I b»r r 
before going back to worl, 
Stonehenge — almost always with 
Bill’s help. 

We sweated and cursed over 
those stones, their meticulously 
determined placement. With one of 
us in the cab of the crane — we’d 
learned to handle the beast with a 
certain elan — the other at the the- 
odolite, we spotted them to the 
nearest inch, mostly. Then we 
rammed fill around them, made a 
final alignment check and drove 
the crane down to the field to haul 
up the next one. Toward the end of 
August we’d put up more than two 
thirds of the sarsen circle and it 
was time to get to the big ones. 

14 



Now, what is found within the 
sarsen circle of a true Stonehenge 
is a horseshoe of trilithons. To 
build a trilithon you erect two mo- 
nolithic uprights and place a mas- 
sive lintel on top, no other stones 
touching. Then the monoliths 
aren’t monoliths any more but 
you’ve got yourself a trilithon. 

This awesome horseshoe has five 
trilithons, arranged with the open 
end toward the heel stone, off to 
the northeast. Their heights vary, 
ascending from the outer ends to 
the dominant central group. 

Bill helped me put up the two 
outer ones, plus the western one 
next in, before he had to leave on 
missions of his own. He left, I 
could tell, with a mixture of relief 
and regret. 

“You’re still out of your 
^nd,” he said. “But so’m I. I’ll 
*«vip you finish it up on weekends.’’ 

We shook hands. He got into 
his battered Rover and drove off 
down the long driveway. There I 
was again, alone with my New 
Hampshire edition of Salisbury 
Plain. I had to get back to MIT, 
but I wanted to put the heel stone 
up first. It was doubly unique — it 
stood off on the slope of the hill 
outside all the rest of it and of all 
the stones it was the only one not 
dressed. The others were finished 
products but the heel stone was a 
natural boulder. 

So I put it up, sweating back 
and forth from cab to theodolite, 
and then it was time to go back to 

IF 




Cambridge. The construction out- 
fit wanted the crane back. I told 
the man he could have it by the end 
of October but not before. 

I T WAS weird going back to 
Cambridge, working in the lab 
again, teaching my two classes, liv- 
ing in my house by myself and al- 
ways Round Hill in my mind. Ev- 
ery Friday I was on the road as 
soon as could be. By Saturday 
morning I was working the crane 
— thanking God I’d listened to Bill 
and that we’d dug the holes first. 
The leaves were falling all over the 
lawns. For once I couldn’t be both- 
ered and there they stayed. What 
my father would have thought! 
But he had never built a Stone- 
henge. 

Bill helped me some weekends. 
But he had something going with 
one of the lab girls and when it 
came to putting up the last lintel I 
was alone on the summit of the 
now almost frightening hill. 

I’d wondered about the curiosity 
of the locals. I hadn’t wanted a lot 
of attention— not for the reasons 
which had caused my tiny wife to 
abandon the scene — but because I 
wanted this to be a private place. If 
Round Hill saw almost all of the 
horizon, then almost all of the ho- 
rizon had Round Hill in view and 
I wondered about that. But this 
corner of the State was so isolated 
that my B.C. edifice attracted no 
interest whatever, as far as I could 
tell. There was, after all, no near 



view and the horizon was a long 
way off. Sooner or later the hunt- 
ers might discover it but up to now 
I and it were in a world by our- 
selves. 

It was almost dusk as I wrestled 
the ultimate stone into place, fill- 
ing in the last gap in the lintels of 
the sarsen circle. Two weekends 
earlier I’d capped the giant up- 
rights of the central and command- 
ing trilithon. Now — with great del- 
icacy, if I may say so — I lowered 
the last lintel into place, checked 
with the theodolite and rammed 
the fill home. For the last time I 
drove the now docile crane through 
the woods to the edge of the field. 
I walked back, then, to see this 
damn thing complete. I’d lived with 
it a long time but was only partly 
prepared for the impact. It was too 
much. 

I wandered about inside that 
place while the sun went down and 
the hunter’s moon came up. With, 
besides, a barred owl sending his 
uninvited eight-hoot cry into the 
night. You ever stood in a place 
like that? You bet your life you 
haven’t. Forget not, friend, this 
wasn’t an ancient ruin — interesting 
enough, and scary in its own way 
— this was something else again, 
just off the assembly line, com- 
plete, new, comely, ready to go. 
The first one in thirty-five hundred 
years. 

I stayed there an hour or so be- 
fore going down to the house. I 
left word with the construction

outfit they could pick up the crane. 
Next day I, closed Round Hill for 
the winter. 

Ill 

C AMBRIDGE. I dreamed. 

Something had been coming up 
on Channel 2 I’d wanted to see — 
something about cybernetics a col- 
league was doing. Mid-November, 
and I’d been stay-up all hours try- 
ing to catch up. So five minutes 
before my colleague came on I 
went to sleep. I dreamed it was 
time for the program and there I 
was, head on pillow, watching the 
screen. Then — but weird — the vid- 
eo and audio swallowed themselves 
into the void and there was the ras- 
ter all by itself, a different voice 
coming from the speaker. 

“Thomas Gridley.” 

No question mark, no exclama- 
tion, just Thomas Gridley — a qui- 
et statement of some basic fact of 
life, said like E=mc 2 . 

“Yes,” I said. “Certainly.” 
What the hell? I was Thomas Grid- 
ley. A dream is a dream, go up 
and down its alleys and see where 
it takes you. “Yes,” I said again. 

“Thomas Gridley,” my televi- 
sion set said in my dream. There 
was no eerie glow from the tube, 
just the dead old raster and this 
voice coming from the speaker. 
“Thomas Gridley. You have done 
well.” 

“That’s good,” I answered. 
Should I say sir, your excellency, 

16 



or what? This didn’t look to be a 
guilt dream, and I was glad of 
that. 

“Thomas Gridley.” x 2 +y 2 = 

. tone of voice like that. “The 
structure appears good. Excellent, 
perhaps. We thank you. You will 
be rewarded. The — er, trial run — 
will come soon.” 

His English was like mine, al- 
most. I understood it all right but 
it seemed to come from a far 
place. 

“Yes?” 

“Before dawn on next midsum- 
mer day you will be at the place of 
what you call — Stonehenge.” I’d 
planned to be there then, of 
course. Was I supposed to say 
something? “You will be there be- 
fore the dawn of that day, Thomas 
Gridley. You will not forget.” 

“Not ’arf likely,” I said and, 
having dreamed, wakened. 

There was the video — there was 
my colleague saying silly and obvi- 
ous things about cybernetics. I 
turned the switch and told myself I 
really should get to bed earlier. It 
didn’t do to be so sleepy I couldn’t 
stay awake waiting for a program 
to come on. 

C ONJURE up conjecture of a 
time. Would you believe June 
twenty-first? 

I walked around the now hairy 
summit of Round Hill, telling my- 
self I wasn’t, of course, there be- 
cause of a witless, unbidden dream 
I’d had more than six months ear- 



IF 




Her and which I’d tried to forget. 
I simply wanted to see — and truly 
I did— if the sun honest-to-God 
would rise directly over the heel 
stone as I stood in the center of 
the sarsen circle and the horseshoe 
of trilithons, sighting through the 
entrance stones, waiting for the 
godhead to slice me to ribbons or 
bear me aloft in a chariot of 
strange device. 

Neither of those things happened 
but the sun did eventually appear 
— just where it was supposed to. 
The upper limb flared into the 
dawn a few degrees north of the 
heel stone and the moment the disc 
cleared the horizon it stood pre- 
cisely over the heel stone, dancing 
there in a blaze I couldn’t look at. 
The morning was misty, dew all 
over everything. My feet were 
soaked through my sneakers and 
some splinter of me noted that and 
wished for warm dry socks, which 
at that moment were about a mil- 
lion light years away. 

I wasn’t sliced to ribbons nor 
borne aloft. I was merely presented 
with a moment to live with the rest 
of my life. 

Something thrust me gently to 
the side of that exact center, and in 
that place appeared a — crystal is 
the simplest word but how do you 
describe a crystal phone booth? 
Conjure into your head something 
of that size, built of glowing blue- 
white slabs, yes, something you’ve 
never seen before, yet business- 
like, no nonsense about it, stand- 



ing there like a spacebus ready to 
pull out as soon as the driver can 
close the door. All right? 

From this structure, vehicle, 
emerged an entity who had to be, 
by the look of him, a Madison 
Avenue junior exec. Color him 
gray. 

“Thomas Gridley,” he says and 
there’s no arguing with that. 

You have the scene? This is the 
summit of Round Hill, a place I’ve 
grown up with, as have ancestors 
before me. By my own hand, with 
the help of Bill, now absent, I have 
here erected the second edition of 
Salisbury Plain and here I now 
stand in the presence of one whose 
suit might well be from Brooks 
Brothers but whose voice comes 
from a far place. 

“Yes,” I said. 

“Call me— Harry,” he said, 
consulting a timepiece on his wrist. 
He approached me and we touched 
skins. His wasn’t cold, not hot, 
was like yours or mine. He walked 
and looked around my Stone- 
henge, cocking his eye this way and 
that. I was glad I’d taken the trou- 
ble to build it right. “Yes,” said 
Harry, “if you hadn’t done it right 
it wouldn’t have — worked. You 
have done well, Thomas Gridley, 
and you will be rewarded. In due 
course.” I followed him around 
the summit of Round Hill in that 
misty dawn. “It is good,” Harry 
said. Again he consulted the in- 
strument on his wrist. 

“Look,” I said. “I’ve been sur- 

17 



SECOND-HAND STONEHENGE 




prised a few times in my life, 
but — ” 

“Yes,” Harry interrupted. 
“Yes. But not like this. I under- 
stand. You have done your job 
well and are entitled to explana- 
tion — which you shall have. But 
just now there isn’t much time. 
Three more of your minutes 
only.” 

“Will you kindly tell me — ” 

“Yes, certainly. But our time 
just now is limited — most severe- 
ly.” Placing his accent was like 
throwing a dart at the Milky Way. 
“I must say first — and most im- 
portantly — that you will be at this 
place three of your months and 



one day from now.” The autum- 
nal equinox, I thought. “Right,” 
Harry said. “I must apologize for 
being brusque, but our time is run- 
ning out. I must very shortly — 
leave.” 

I thought about the nondream 
I’d had back in November. 

“But,” I said, “you can be in 
touch with me whenever you want. 
What’s the—” 

“Yes, Thomas Gridley — but 
that is a very — expensive way to do 
it. This is better,” Harry said. His 
inspection was apparently com- 
plete. He stood at the door of the 
crystal phone booth. He looked at 
the thing on his wrist again and I 



craned my gaze at it. He held it so 
I could see and I almost wished I 
hadn’t been so nosy. It looked like 
an IBM 3600 cut down to wrist 
size. “That way of contact is very 
difficult,” Harry said. “That is 
why we caused you to build this — 
what you would call, I think — 
black box or bucket of bolts.” 

“All right,” I said. “I’ll be here. 
But where are you from? What — ” 
“That will come later, Thomas 
Gridley. I am sorry. But I say, 
quickly now, you will be here on 
the dawn of what is your autum- 
nal equinox and you will have at 
hand two surface vehicles — station 
wagons — to transport seven or 




SECOND-HAND STONEHENGE 



19 




eight of us from this place to oth- 
er places.” 

“But—” 

Harry slipped something into 
my hand. 

“You will do it, Thomas Grid- 
ley.” He stepped into the crystal, 
glancing again at that computer on 
his wrist. “Accept my apology. We 
owe you much and we are not an 
impolite people. Though we can do 
much, we are not omnipotent. We 
thank you, Thomas Gridley. We 
shall meet again at the appointed 
hour.” 

I sensed that his crystal was 
about to take off. 

“I’ll be here,” I said again. 
“One question — ” I indicated the 
Stonehenge with a sweep of my 
hand. “How does—” 

“The trilithon lintels,” Harry 
said. “They — focus the solar ener- 
gy — only on certain days. You will 
be told later. Now I — ” 

. and I was alone on the sum- 
mit of Round Hill. The lower limb 
of the sun was a few degrees above 
the horizon and had moved south- 
ward from the point where the heel 
stone marked the horizon. I 
walked around for a while, won- 
dering whether to tell Bill — or any- 
body— what had happened. I didn’t 
decide then, threw the whole ball 
of wax up in the air, walked down 
the road through the woods, then 
through the north field and back to 
the house. 

Not until night did I remember 



that Harry had thrust something 
into my hand just before leaving. I 
retrieved it from my jacket pocket. 
It was a bundle of beat-up hun- 
dred-dollar bills. How had he ar- 
ranged that? Anyway, he wanted 
two station wagons and was will- 
ing to pay for them. 

Going to sleep at Round Hill 
that night, thinking back to the be- 
ginning of this caper, I realized 
with a start but also with a sense 
of puzzle pieces clicking into 
place, that this had begun when I’d 
bought that copy of Out There at 
Nini’s Corner exactly a year ago. I 
wondered where my tiny ex-wife 
was and what she was up to. It 
seemed I’d gone a long way from 
there — from that time. 

M IDSUMMER day to autum- 
nal equinox. That’s ninety 
one days and a few hours and 
that’s a long time to wait. I’d plen- 
ty of work to do but my heart 
wasn’t in it. I spent too much time 
looking for things to do to make 
the time go. None of these 
worked, so I went back to first 
principles — I studied my Stone- 
henge. 

I chipped at some of the stones, 
the uprights. They were good Ver- 
mont granite, no doubt about it. 
Recalling Harry’s final words, I 
took a ladder up there and banged 
away at the trilithon lintels, all five 
of them. Nothing. Nothing could I 
chip off, that is, with geologist’s 
pick, nor with cold chisel and the 

IF 



20 




biggest hammer I could hold. They 
weren’t Vermont granite, nor Ver- 
mont anything. They looked like 
granite but all resemblance ended 
there. % 

Fighting down a sense of sacri- 
lege I set upon one of those lintels 
with a rented pneumatic hammer. 
Nothing. Abandoning brute force, 

I applied to each of those brooding 
stones a variety of sophisticated 
sensors and transducers. Nothing. 

I brooded some more and tried to 
pass the time. 

I bought two baby-blue station 
wagons," kept them in the Round 
Hill parking space. Even those in- 
offensive automobiles gave me the 
treatment. Who was going where 
in those, to do what? 

As all days must, those long 
ones ended, individually and col- 
lectively. Autumnal equinox. 
Night and day of equal length ev- 
erywhere. Everywhere on earth, - 
that is. A delicate arrangement, if 
you stop to think about it. And I 
stood in the center of my sarsen 
circle waiting for the sun to rise. 

The first show of the solar disc 
was right on schedule. It rose, of 
course, far south of the place 
where the heel stone marked the 
horizon. I knew there was some 
difference of opinion among 
Stonehengologists as to whether 
the equinoxes, as well as the sol- 
stices, were consequential — well, I 
knew the sunrise horizon point at 
equinox was critical, as least as 
concerned those five center lintels 



— either that or no spacebus would 
appear this morning. 

I wanted to make some observa- 
tions of the sunrise horizon point 
in relation to those lintels but I 
knew there wouldn’t be much time 
and I wanted another look at the 
phone booth, so I stood near the 
center of my trilithonic horseshoe, 
waiting. The sun cleared the hori- 
zon and there we were — there it 
was again. I had brought the sta- 
tion wagons up to the edge of the 
field and would have felt like an id- 
iot child tf the crystal hadn’t come. 

Harry emerged. I stepped for- 
ward. “Thomas Gridley,’’ he said. 
“Good. The vehicles?’’ 

I nodded toward the road 
through the wood. 

“Good,’’ he said again. 

Behind him people — well, pre- 
sumably people, people like Har- 
ry, were emerging from the crys- 
tal. Carrying bags and all, like a 
bunch of conventiojoeers getting 
out of the airport taxi. 

There were nine of them, men 
and women, or should I say, male 
and female. They looked at me 
curiously as they emerged. Be it 
understood that that space was re- 
ally just about phone booth size — 
they couldn’t all have been in there 
but they kept coming out. One 
came forward. 

“Thomas,’’ said Harry. “This is 
Catherine.’’ 

C OLOR her in many colors, 
color her beautiful. Color her 



SECOND-HAND STONEHENGE 



21 




All-American girl and color her 
plain. Splash her with the Milky 
Way, and say she grew up in the 
house next to yours in Dubuque. 

I mumbled something. What do 
you say when you’re introduced to 
Miss Universe for real? Our hands 
touching, her warm skin on mine. 

Harry glanced at the sun, at the 
computer on his wrist. 

“It is time. Catherine will tell 
you — many things,’’ and he was in- 
to the crystal just before it disap- 
peared. 

Catherine disengaged her hand 
and confronted me with the group. 
She mentioned names. The eight 
nodded with great courtesy. 

“The vehicles are near,’’ Cather- 
ine said. “Let us go.’’ 

My intellectual clarity quotient 
wasn’t exactly peaking at the mo- 
ment, my computer being over- 
loaded with input, but I had the 
wit to lead them to the two wag- 
ons waiting at the end of the road 
through the woods. I said the igni- 
tion keys were in the locks, the 
tanks were filled with gas and did 
they need anything. 

“Thank you, Thomas Gridley,” 
one of the men said. He then ig- 
nored me and indicated who should 
get into what vehicle. They divided 
up into two couples in each, 
stowed their luggage aboard and 
drove off. Down that dusty road 
through the field they went, into 
the driveway facing that early 
morning sun, then off and away. 

Leaving Catherine with me. 



“You’re not going with them,’’ I 
said, achieving some kind of state- 
ment of the year. 

She stood at my side, Miss Uni- 
verse, Miss Kansas, and agreed 
that it was so. 

“But— what— ’’ 

“Yes, Thomas. We have much 
to speak of. But in the meantime. 
I’m hungry. We were so busy get- 
ting ready — even though we had so 
much notice. We could have — a 
breakfast?’’ 

Yes, we could have a breakfast 
and we did. I wasn’t exactly scared 
but I was in a state. I attended to 
that breakfast with a care Henri 
Soule couldn’t have faulted. 

My mind was filled with ques- 
tions about spacegates and extra- 
terra but — sharing Catherine’s 
breakfast, made with my own hand 
in my country kitchen — I felt like 
an adolescent on his first encoun- 
ter. I was no adolescent, no, and 
encounters and confrontations 
were in my history but this was 
something else. Questions were in 
my mind, all right, and probably 
there were some in hers — but this 
was not the time. The others had 
gone off down the dusty driveway 
in the baby-blue wagons and Har- 
ry had returned to God knew 
where in the crystal phone booth. 
Catherine and I were at Round 
Hill alone. Would be for some 
time? How long? Three months? 
Anyway, this was not the time for 
questions, not that kind. This was 
the time to establish something

about us, expose some images of 
her and me upon an unseen film 
that might later produce a reada- 
ble picture. 

It took most of the day to show 
her around the place. She made 
appropriate remarks. We knew the 
tour was window dressing, getting 
to know you. I held her hand or 
arm now and again, going through 
the woods or up the Hill and each 
time I was twenty .years back 
there.

rounded by monoliths, lintels, 
trilithons, the one and only opera- 
tive Stonehenge. 

“Catherine?” 

“Yes?” 

“You will — the others are gone 
— but you will stay with me for a 
while?” 

“Yes.” 

“The others have a mission, 
missions, elsewhere? Right?” She 
nodded that sweet head. “Your 
mission is to stay with me?” 

She nodded again. I was slowly 
beginning to wonder if I was miss- 
ing something here. They had been 
so busy getting ready to do — 
what? Twinges of guilt in my 
mind? Questions multiplying in my 
head, rabbits in spring. Catherine 
sensed that. 

She asked, “Can we swim in the 
pond?” 

“Of course. Do you swim where 



you — ” She was off and running. 

At times l am indeed an idiot 
child, as then, when I wondered for 
a moment what she had in mind by 
way of bikini or whatever. I gave 
off running after her, watched her 
throw her clothes aside and dive in- 
to the pond, whose waters had not 
seen her like before. I joined her 
moments later. The water was cold 
but it was nice and we splashed 
around and swam and played. I 
went back, then, all the way 
through adolescence into some- 
thing earlier, playing in a bathtub 
with a cousin of mine. I’d loved 
her with all of my four- or five- 
year-old heart. 

The water was cold but the air 
was warm and we lay in the grass 
at the side of the pond and I left 
that bathtub once more behind me, 
shot through adolescence like a 
skyrocket and emerged — in due 
course — into a now of unfamiliar 
dimensions. 

The dimensions were unfamil- 
iar, yes, but they were agreeable — 
and that’s another some kind of 
statement of the year. 

I took Catherine that evening to 
a country roadside place. A nice 
one and she discovered she liked 
martinis. And Maine lobster. And 
there was so much to talk about 
that we didn’t talk about anything, 
not anything important, not about 
the thousand questions in my head. 

We talked some, later in bed. 
Having been that day all the way 
back into a bathtub with my five-

year-old girl cousin, thence 
through pubescence once more and 
then into the breach of a now 
whose parameters were as yet un- 
determined, it was not difficult to 
go back fifteen months to one of 
the last times I had had much to 
say to somebody sharing my, as 
they say, bed and board. Then I 
had asked my tiny wife what was 
wrong with having my own Stone- 
henge and that had led to the end 
of our attempt to maintain viable 
relationship. Now here I was, most 
improbably, with Cathy, brought 
here via that same Stonehenge I 
had discussed with my then wife — 
and gone off into the night, in 
righteous rage, to order from 
Novel Products. I could still hear 
the clang of the mail box slot. 

I should have said, we talked a 
little, later in bed. By the time we 
got to talking much we were both 
ready for sleep. The whole thing 
was a dream anyway, it seemed to 
me. It seemed this girl by my side 
had been here forever but partly I 
knew she was from Out There — 
though she couldn’t be more here. 
And there were all those questions. 
“Catherine,” I said. “Cathy?” 
“Yes, Thomas?” 

“You could call me Tom.” 

“I like Thomas.” 

“I like Cathy. Is that your real 
name or just for — here?” 

We were drinking a nightcap. 
“Just for here — but I like it.” 
She yawned. ° 

“We have three months?” 



“Yes, Thomas.’’ She came' 
close. She was the girl next door 
I’d grown up with. 

“Then — you go?” 

Cathy didn’t answer. She looked 
at me, turned and snuggled her 
back into my lap. She said she was 
sleepy. 

“All right,” I said. “Harry said 
you would tell me lots of things, 
bunches of things. Let’s do just 
one tonight, all right?” 

“All right.” 

“Where?” 

“Where what, Thomas?” 

“Tell you one thing— a woman 
is a woman no matter where she’s 
“Where are you from, Cathy? 
You, Harry, the others — where’s 
home?” 

“It doesn’t matter,’’ she said, 
stretching. 

I got her point but I still wanted 
to know. 

“Where?” 

“What you call — the Pleiades. 
The third planet of — Maia.” 

“Oh.’’ Silence for a time. 
“That’s good,” I said. 

“Why, Thomas?” 

“At least it’s in the same gal- 
axy.” 

“Yes.” She laughed and yawned 
again. “Sleep — it is a gentle 
thing — ” 

“Beloved from pole to pole — ” 
Eventually we did sleep.

months can be a week or a year

— but this quarter of a year 
seemed more like a day or two. I 
met my commitments at the lab as 
best I could — which was not as dif- 
ficult as might have been since 
Cathy had an interest and skills 
and understandings and ideas that 
made me wonder how much of her 
iceberg was showing. She was not 
an iceberg but what she showed in 
the lab posed a question: how 
much of her was beneath the sur- 
face? Once, introducing her as a 
visiting professor from Prague, I 
gave her one of my classes for a 
week. She was great. My students 
picketed for a return engagement. 
I let them have her for one more 
week, then told them the professor 
had been compelled to return to 
Prague. They booed, the unappre- 
ciative clods. 

We managed to sneak a week at 
Martinique but mostly we lived 
and worked in Cambridge. Cathy 
answered a lot of my questions. 
We took care of most of them in 
one all-night session — after we had 
settled down a bit. 

I had intimations of guilt and ir- 
responsibility to deal with, so I 
went at those first. In or with what 
was I cooperating? Were Cathy’s 
people goodies or baddies? Cathy 
was a goody, all right, but what 
were those other eight doing out 
there? I’d sprung the catch on what 
Pandora’s box? Was this, for ex- 
ample, some kind of takeover 



“Then what? A missionary bit — 
bringing VD and Calvinism to the 
noble savage?’’ 

My hackles were up a bit. She 
laughed, soothed me in seconds 
with consummate skill. 

“We are not missionaries, 
Thomas. And you’re not a savage, 
silly.’’ 

“Gee, thanks.’’ 

“Stop it.’’ 

Then she put together a story 
for me. Terra was a colony, a col- 
ony known to be in some disarray, 
a colony that had also gone sour 
earlier, millennia ago, gone from 
reasonably high estate back to the 
Stone Age. I had more or less ex- 
pected this but still I was put down 
a bit. I had always thought of 
Earthmen going out there, doing 
the colonizing. So we’re a back- 
ward colony. All right. Humility is 
a thing commendable, yes— but 
my supply was precarious. 

“Not only — ’’ Cathy put her 
hand on mine — “backward but 
wayward,’’ she said. 

That I bought without offense. 

That other Stonehenge — on Sal- 
isbury Plain — that had been, a 
spacegate too? Yes. Cathy didn’t 
know the raison d'etre for that 
one. 

“That was long before my 
time,’’ she said. “I’m glad this one 
wasn’t.’’ 

W HY spacegates? Direct com- 
munication between Maia 
Gamma and the colonies was pos-

thing?’’ 

“No, Thomas. Oh, no.

sible but it took time and was not 
easy. Where actual, physical space 
travel was not involved — as in the 
electromagnetic manipulation of 
the vacuum tube or transistor driv- 
ing the voice coil in the speaker of 
my radio or TV — the problems 
were not beyond economic solu- 
tion. But space travel itself, the 
long jump through the big black at 
a distance of (in our case) almost 
500 light years, even with space 
warps and all, was costly. Hence 
the spacegate, hence Stonehenge. 
Why swim the Atlantic to say hel- 
lo if you can pick up a phone and 
talk? I got the message. 

“But,” I said. We were sitting 
up in bed. She was cuter than any-" 
thing. “But the five lintels, the 
Novel Products operation, must 
have — ” 

“Cost a lot. Yes. But now the 
Stonehenge is working. We can — 
though only four times a year — 
just walk from home to here.” She 
blinked-those lashes at me. “And 
you’ve made it so well it will prob- 
ably work for hundreds of years. 
So it’s a bargain.” 

“Cease and desist,” I said, 
“from frivolity. You don’t need to 
wave the lashes. Of course I made 
it well. That’s the way I make — ” 

She pinched me and it took 
some time to get back on track— 
but I have said this was an all-night 
session. 

The Out There magazine was a 
put-on, a gimmick? Yes. The only 
copy in existence, all arranged. So 



I had a collector’s item. Back, 
then, to intimations of guilt and 
irresponsibility. 

“So what are those eight doing 
out there?” 

Not hard to explain, she said. 
Life on Maia Gamma had become 
dull. No worlds to conquer, no fun 
and games, no frontier. They had 
come to Terra looking for ideas, 
ways to liven things up back home. 

“I will be damned,” I said. 

“What?” 

“Advanced mother planet comes 
to the boondocks looking for 
kicks.” 

“Well— yes.” 

Simple as that. 

“Well, we got lots going on,” I 
said. “Race riots, Vietnam, fam- 
ine, lots of stuff. We could export 
some of that.” 

“Don’t be angry with me, Tho- 
mas Gridley.” She hadn’t called 
me that since we met. “It’s not my 
fault.” 

I wasn’t angry with Cathy, I 
don’t think, but I wasn’t enthralled 
by the picture. 

“Wayward we are,” I said. 
“Right. But mama planet is very 
advanced indeed and comes here 
looking for kicks to brighten the 
home scene. While lots of colo- 
nials starve, kill each other and all 
kinds of other things are fouled 
up. So why don’t you spread some 
of the advancement around?” 

“You are angry,” she said. “I’ll 
make us another drink.” She did. 
“It’s been tried. We’ve tried it and 



26 



IF 




you’ve tried it. It doesn’t work. It 
doesn’t. You know it as well as I.” 
“What?” 

“Thomas. Five minutes ago you 
didn’t want us being missionaries 
to the savages — Five minutes ago. 
And what did your missionaries 
take to — Samoa, say? VD and 
Calvinism, as you said.” 

Touche , let’s drop it. And I’m 
not mad any more.” 1 showed her 
that was so. “So what do you, 
those eight, have in mind by way 
of kicks?” 

“I don’t know — they don’t 
know. That’s their problem, not 
mine. They’re looking around, 
trying things, seeing what works. 
Grass, Las Vegas, acid, East Vil- 
lage, who knows?” 

“Mama planet, highly advanced, 
comes to the boondocks to take 
stuff like that back?” 

“It does seem silly, I know. But 
it’s not my idea and life back 
home does seem dull.” She looked 
at me thoughtfully. “I’m glad they 
brought n\e along — to stay with 
you. You’re my problem.” 

So take me back with you, I 
started to say, but I was a coward. 

To continue— Cathy and I 
weren’t bored — right — but not be- 
cause of any of the kick-type 
things they were looking for to 
take home. It was because of us. 
We wondered about that. 

“I don’t know,” Cathy said, 
“maybe it’s because you’re from 
one world and I’m from another. 
I don’t know.” 



We soon got onto other things. 
“Why me, then? Why Thomas 
Gridley?” 

She didn’t know that either. 

“But it was a good choice, the 
right one, wasn’t it? The Stone- 
henge is there. You built it. Who 
else would have?” 

“If the lintels are the only func- 
tioning parts of the device — why 
the sarsen circle?” 

“Window dressing.” 

I began to get mad again — un- 
til I thought of that magnificent 
structure standing there on top of 
Round Hill. I forgave them the 
window dressing. 

T HE weeks went too fast. Every 
time I turned around, Decem- 
ber twenty-first was staring over 
my shoulder. We were something, 
Cathy and I — we deserved to sur- 
vive. A few days before rendezvous 
we were at Round Hill. There had 
been snow and I had put the plow 
onto the jeep to keep the road to 
Stonehenge open. We had plowed 
our way up and back, were having 
hot buttered rum in the kitchen. 

I’ve said I was a coward and 
that is, alas, sometimes the case — 
though not always. I had been a 
coward in one important aspect 
with Cathy, though, and now it 
was time to summon up the blood. 
The matter had been implicit in 
many of our conversations, had 
been thrust somewhere into a far 
corner of the bed when we slept 
together, had hidden behind the

orange juice at breakfast, behind 
the twist of lemon in the martini 
at five. In the kitchen at Round 
Hill I summoned up the blood. 
“Cathy,” I said. 

“Yes?” 

I took a deep breath. “I’ve been 
thinking about this a long time 
and I've been afraid to bring it up. 
We’re good for each other, right?” 
She nodded. “I’ll make it simple. 
In a couple of days the spacebus 
comes and you go.” She turned 
her head, looked out at the spruces 
and the snow. “Why can’t you 
stay, or why can’t I go with you? 
We should be together. We haven’t 
talked about it but there’s always 
been an unspoken implication or 
assumption that it’s no go. Why?” 
She turned to look at me, my 
Miss Universe from Dubuque. 

“I cannot stay, Thomas. Much 
asl would want to.” 

Damn it to hell. She wanted to 
stay and that fractured me on all 
fracturable planes. 

“Then—” 

“Radiation,’’ she said and 
shrugged. “Maia and Sol are sim- 
ilar suns but not identical. For us, 
three months here is about the 
limit. I must go back, Thomas.” 
“Then I’ll go with you. If you 
want me. If our radiation is too 
much for you, I ought to be able 
to take yours like a breeze.” 

“I want you, Thomas. But it’s 
not too much radiation — it’s the 
wrong kind. Little differences in 
the spectrum. I don’t understand 



it. You couldn’t stay on Maia 
either.” 

“I could stay three months. Is 
your time like ours? Years, life- 
time?” 

“Close enough,” Cathy said. I 
made more hot buttered rum. She 
helped me. It was good. “Yes. 
You could come for three months. 
Not this time.” My eyebrows shot 
up. “It would have to be arranged, 
approved. But next time. If you 
wanted to. But — ” 

“But what?” 

“It would be even more diffi- 
cult then than now, wouldn’t it? 
And now is bad enough. Un- 
less — ” 

“Unless what?” I asked, not 
particularly liking the way my 
voice sounded. 

Cathy evaded that. We kicked 
our hangup around a long time, 
through the rum, through dinner 
at the nice place by the roadside, 
through going to bed under the 
electric blanket with a fire in the 
fireplace. We finally got to sleep. 
I should have stayed awake. I had 
a lousy dream: my feet were in 
concrete in some blockhouse while 
Cathy, radiant as heaven, got into 
a distant elevator and rode up the 
side of some gantry, story after 
story, toward the passenger mod- 
ule of a vehicle that made Saturn 
V look like a bottle rocket held by 
a kid. The liftoff woke me. Cathy 
was still there and I sought 
warmth. But I didn’t go back to 
sleep for a long time.

IF 




W E WALKED up toward the 
edge of the field where the 
station wagons would come. I car- 
ried Cathy’s bag — she was all 
packed and ready to go. When I 
walked back down to the house I 
would be walking by myself. 

The station wagons came about 
twenty minutes before sunrise. 
They unloaded a wild assortment 
of stuff they had to carry through 
the wood road to the Stonehenge. 
They had been to Vegas, all right. 
They had a one-armed bandit in 
their gear. But I didn’t pay much 
attention to their cargo. I just 
stood there on top of the hill with 
Cathy. 

Numbness has survival value at 
times and numb was how I felt. 
Spacebus due in — I looked at my 
watch, not Harry’s computer but 
accurate enough — four minutes. 
Cathy suddenly gripped my hand, 
released it and left my side, spoke 
urgently to one of the men for 
almost a minute. They had some 
kind of argument. Then the man 
shrugged, opened one of the bags 
at his feet on the snowy ground. 
Cathy beckoned to me. I walked 
over. 

“Take off your coat and jack- 
et,” she said. “Roll up your sleeve. 
Hurry.” 

This was a Cathy I hadn’t seen 
before. 

“What—” 

“Now.” she said. Tell you, a 
woman is a — 

The man, whose Terran name 



was Fred, deftly wrapped a twen- 
tieth-century tourniquet around 
my upper arm and with an ump- 
teenth-century device withdrew 
blood from a handy vein. No nee- 
dle — but he got the blood all right. 

“The pants down* Thomas, 
quickly.” 

I have said I was numb and she 
beat me to my pants. Fred applied 
a different device to my left testis, 
then socked both samples into his 
case and waited impatiently for the 
crystal booth. Doctors are the 
same all over too. I hitched up my 
trousers. 

“Will you kindly tell me — ” 

“Only one minute left, Thomas. 
Don’t count on anything, don’t. 
But some genetic codes can be — 
modified. Some can’t. Mine can’t, 
not for the radiation. There’s a 
chance yours can. I didn’t want to 
talk about it. It’s a long shot.” 

Then the booth was there, Harry 
fussing around, making them hur- 
ry. The eight shoved their stuff 
through the gate and Cathy had to 
go. 

“I’ll let you know,” she said. 

I SAID at the beginning of this 
histoire I’d tell you what I was 
going to do. Time now to redeem 
that pledge. All right. I’m going 
to go, that’s what I’m going to do. 
I’m wandering around on top of 
Round Hill, waiting, and I won’t 
be waiting long. Spring equinox,

There are those who don't want 
you to know. Read this story — 
and you're a potential threat! 



M Y FIRST week of psychiatric 
residency at Piltdown Hos- 
pital was relatively uneventful. I 
had come there with some trepida- 
tion, for Piltdown had won the 
reputation hands down of being 
the most overcrowded mental in- 
stitution in England. But the lib- 
eral use of the new tranquilizing 
drugs had quieted many of the 
most difficult patients and allowed 
others to be treated on an outpa- 
tient basis. 

I had been hired personally by 
the director and owner of the hos- 
pital, Dr. Czento. My first inter- 
view was conducted on a rather 
friendly basis and he seemed im- 
pressed with my credentials. 



“I am a wealthy man,” he said 
at the end of the interview. “I am 
without children and near kin. I 
have my eye out for someone who 
might take over when I retire/’ 

I smiled at this broad but gra- 
cious hint and I must admit that I 
did not take it too seriously. I 
picked up my letters of recommen- 
dation to return to my carrying 
case and accidentally knocked a fat 
portfolio off the desk of Dr. Czen- 
to. We both leaned forward to re- 
trieve it and collided. 

“I am sorry,” I muttered, some- v 
what embarrassed at my clumsi- 
ness. Then I became aware that 1 
had nicked my forehead on the 
corner of a pin in his lapel. It was a 



31 



beautifully formed white kid in a 
stylized wheat field of bright yel- 
low enamel. 

“You’re bleeding/’ said Dr. 
Czento and despite my protests he 
insisted on cleaning the wound and 
covering it with a small bandaid. 

“What a handsome pin you 
have,’’ I said. “Is it an emblem of 
a psychiatric society?’’ 

Dr. Czento’s face took on an air 
of pride. 

“Not quite,’’ he said. “It’s the 
insignia of a fairly distinguished 
group, the Tammuz Society. We 
dabble in real estate.’’ 

Before I left his office he had 
made me a firm offer and I ac- 
cepted it. I went back to London 
and packed my bags, disposed of 
my flat and furniture and drove 
out to Piltdown in my battered 
Triomphe Six. 

It had been agreed that I would 
undergo a kind of post-training 
analysis at the hands of Dr. Czen- 
to. The daily hour spent free-as- 
sociating on his worn leather couch 
was fruitful but tedious and I 
would come away thoroughly ex- 
hausted. I liked his sense of humor 
and his direct manner, although I 
found him sometimes erratic, even 
unpredictable. Once I recounted a 
hideous dream in which I found 
myself in bed with Adolf Hitler. 

Dr. Czento tugged at his short 
goatee and then muttered quietly, 
“Politics makes for strange bed- 
fellows.’’ 

He urged me to visit about the 



hospital and become familiar with 
each of the patients and I set 
about the task quite methodically. 
Some were odd, some frightening, 
some quite pathetic but Stanley 
Pendleton was unique. I had heard 
of him long before I visited his 
room. He was the eccentric scion 
of a middle-class merchant family 
prominent in fine leather goods 
and claimed fluency in ten lan- 
guages, including Sumerian. 

Although he wasn’t going to be 
my patient, I planned my visit with 
great care. I went to the files to ex- 
amine his folder and, to my sur- 
prise, it wasn’t there. The office 
secretary was no help and I re- 
ported the matter to Dr. Czento. 

He shook his head and shrugged. 

“The clerk misfiled it,’’ he said 
wryly. “You’ll manage without the 
folder.’’ .. 

I thought this answer was most 
peculiar but I didn’t feel free to say 
so. I went directly to the second 
floor and knocked at Pendleton’s 
door, waiting until the soft spoken, 
“Please come in,’’ floated through 
the door. 

W HEN I first entered Pendle- 
ton’s room I was over- 
whelmed by the profusion of things 
covering the walls and the clutter 
of manuscripts and mechanical 
objects on, under and around his 
bed. Pendleton himself, a red- 
haired fellow with freckled com- 
plexion, waved me in with good 
humor. 



32 



IF 




I was quite nervous at first and 
pulled my pipe out of my breast 
pocket to give play to my hands. 
Pendleton smiled and his eyes 
moved for just a single moment to 
the sign high up on the north wall 
which forbade smoking. I stuffed 
the pipe back into my pocket. And 
then, for the first time, I noticed a 
most extraordinary piece of appa- 
ratus. In that curiously aware 
manner of his, Pendleton followed 
my gaze without seeming to. 

“It is intriguing, isn’t it?’’ he 
said. 

He reached over and disentan- 
gled it from the surrounding clut- 
ter and handed it to me. I’m not 
much good with mechanical sys- 
tems but even I could tell that it 
was a fantastically ingenious con- 
struction. 

“What on earth is it?’’ 

“An orrery,’’ said Pendleton 
proudly. “One that I made myself. 
If you turn this handle here, each 
of these little fellows — which re- 
present different planets — moves 
about the sun at the proper relative 
speed. The scale of sizes isn’t cor- 
rect but the distances and phases of 
orbits are. And I’ve left out the 
satellites. Otherwise it’s quite ac- 
curate.’’ 

“Beautifully made,’’ I said. “It 
must have taken you months to 
do.’’ 

“Two years,’’ said Pendleton. 

I had been counting the little 
planetary balls and there were ten. 
I wondered if it would be harmful 



to point out this error to Pendle- 
ton. And then I decided in the in- 
terest of honesty, I ought to. 

“You’ve one planet too many,’’ 
I said. 

Pendleton’s smile died. 

“So you’ve noticed it, have you? 
Our great modern astronomers 
have no real notion of the origin of 
Ceres and the other two thousand 
asteroids between Mars and Jupi- 
ter. But I know.’’ 

I became somewhat tense. 
Clearly I had uncovered one of 
Pendleton’s fixations and I had no 
desire at this first visit to push the 
matter. 

“I’m sure you do,’’ I said. 

Pendleton seemed to grow very 
angry with me. His eyes flamed 
and the veins of his neck became 
distended. 

“For God’s sake, man,” he 
snapped, “don’t humor me. You 
don’t believe a bit of it and you 
damned well know it. But I have 
unimpeachable sources that give 
firm proof of what I’m saying.” 

His brow furrowed. 

“I oughtn’t tell you,” he mut- 
tered to himself. “I’ve tried to tell 
Czento and he thinks I’m delusion- 
al and won’t listen. Still, I suppose 
one ought not to give up trying 
even if it touches on the elements 
of my supposed psychosis.” 

I assumed my most benign ex- 
pression. 

“I’ll honor your trust, of 
course,” I said. 

He took the orrery out of my 

33

hands and placed it back on the 
floor. 

t<r FWO years ago,” began Pen- 

A dleton, “I received an urgent 
summons to the oil-soaked king- 
dom of Nahrum in the Middle 
East. It seemed that the Sheikh of 
Nahrum had come upon a clay 
tablet in early Sumerian which he 
wanted me to decipher and trans- 
late. As you may have heard, I 
am the world’s foremost expert in 
Sumerian. 

“I arrived in short order, not an- 
ticipating a stay of more than a 
few weeks. I was given the most 
lavish suite in the Sheikh’s own 
palace, was washed and scented by 
a bevy of lovely women and 
brought to the Throne Room. The 
Sheikh himself was a small man 
with intense black eyes and a large 
curved nose that was the pride of 
his people. He told me that he was 
the direct descendant of Tammuz 
and related the prehistory of his 
peoples. It was clear that he took 
great delight in the milennia-old 
culture of Nahrum.” 

“Did you say Tammuz?’’ I 
asked. 

He seemed annoyed at the inter- 
ruption. 

“An ancient divinity of the re- 
gion,” he said. 

I decided not to pursue the 
point. 

“After a while,” Pendleton re- 
sumed his account, “the Sheikh 
got down to business. ‘One of my 

34 



people, a shepherd by trade,’ said 
the Sheikh, ‘came across the cave 
in the mountains to the north of 
Wadi-El-Zur. As you know, our 
climate is extremely dry and acts 
as an excellent preservative.’ 

“ ‘Sounds a good deal like the 
discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls,’ 
I said warily. 

“ ‘That may be,’ said the Sheikh 
quietly. ‘But I have reason to be- 
lieve that this tablet antedates the 
Scrolls by a thousand years.’ 

“I was skeptical, of course. And 
yet these words fired my imagina- 
tion. The Sheikh clapped his hands 
and a large glass case was brought 
in by four servants who staggered 
under the load. At once my heart 
began to pound like a triphammer. 
The tablet was made of an unusual 
clay — like nothing I had seen be- 
fore. But most exciting were the 
blocks of cuneiform letters. If the 
writing was Sumerian — it was a 
variety unknown to the world. 

“ ‘What do you think of my tab- 
let?’ asked the Sheikh, pleased at 
my reaction. 

“ ‘It’s fascinating. But I have to 
examine it more closely before I 
can make accurate comments.’ 

“ ‘Certainly,’ said the Sheikh. 
‘For the time being, the tablet is 
yours. I will be forced, of course, 
to post additional guards about 
your person but only as a precau- 
tion against the accidental loss of 
the tablet.’ 

“ ‘I shan’t be offended,’ I said. 

“The Sheikh ran his fingers 

IF 




through his thick black beard. 

“ ‘If you can correctly translate 
the contents of this tablet,’ he said, 
‘I am prepared to pay you the sum 
of five thousand British pounds.’ 

“It was a princely offer and I 
was taken aback but I made no 
comment. I took the tablet to my 
room and set about translating it. 
With all due modesty I must ad- 
mit that the language itself was the 
least of my troubles. It seemed at 
first to be a precursor of one of 
-the five known Sumerian dialects, 
although I now think it was not. 
Within four or five weeks I had 
worked it out almost in its entire- 
ty. But interpreting the contents 
was most baffling. 

“At first it seemed that I had a 
scientific treatise on my hands, one 
concerned with astronomical mat- 
ters of extraordinary sophistica- 
tion. Although I knew the basic 
sciences, I was badly equipped for 
this material. I began painstaking- 
ly to work through the transla- 
tion— believe me, I had the devil’s 
own job working on the physics. 

“I spent most of each evening 
and part of the night translating. 
In five months’ time the work was 
complete and I read my transla- 
tion to the Sheikh. He seemed afi- 
noyed and downright skeptical of 
what I told him. There were refer- 
ences to the astronomical observa- 
tory of Bahkrar, the legendary 
capital of Nahrum, which is now 
just a dirty pastoral village. Ap- 
parently the most careful and de- 

THE FIFTH PLANET 



tailed astronomical observations 
were carried out there — all, of 
course, with the naked eye. 

“I notice,” said Pendleton, 
“that you’re fighting to suppress 
a look of disbelief and I really 
don’t blame you. It does sound 
like a made-up tale. But now 
comes the really startling part. It 
seems that the astronomers made 
their observations roughly one 
thousand years before the birth of 
Christ. They were terribly con- 
cerned because of perturbations 
taking place in the planetary or- 
bits, not to mention those of the 
moon. There were also violent tid- 
al fluctuations that could not be 
explained. And yet, coincident with 
these strange effects, it was noticed 
that the fifth planet had begun to 
dim, as if it were growing smaller 
with time. 

“There were also references to 
the Lord of Life and Death and his 
dominion over all the heavens. 
The Sheikh seemed to grow in- 
creasingly annoyed with me and 
then, to my intense surprise, he 
had a second tablet brought out. 
The Sumerian was the same but 
the clay seemed less ancient. I 
studied this new material and 
found that the style had changed. 
There was a description of how 
the fifth planet was being removed 
from the skies and replaced with 
an enormously dense spheroid of 
the proper mass, orbital velocity, 
angular momentum and other 
physical properties.’’ 



35 




At this point Pendleton suddenly 
broke off his narration. 

“What happened next?” I asked 
encouragingly. 

P ENDLETON shrugged. “It 
doesn’t matter. 1 had some dif- 
ficulty with the next sections and 
the Sheikh flew into a rage. His 
dark skin turned white as the sands 
surrounding his palace. He mut- 
tered something about Tammuz, 
then jumped to his feet and 
shouted that I was an idiot, incom- 
petent at translating Sumerian and 
that he would not give me a single 
penny, let alone my promised five 
thousand pounds.” 

“Normally I’m the mildest of 
men,” said Pendleton. “But this in- 
sulting, callous behavior inflamed 
me. I struck the Sheikh right 
across his enormous nose, break- 
ing it and staining his ceremonial 
robes with wine-dark blood. It was 
lese-majeste and 1 knew that 1 was 
in the soup as soon as I’d done the 
deed. 1 was in danger of execu- 
tion— perhaps with luck, a long 
prison term. Fortunately the For- 
eign Service intervened. The Brit- 
ish government took me into cus- 
tody after persuasion convinced 
the Sheikh that I should be trans- 
ferred to Piltdown Hospital.” 

“But why Piltdown? Why a 
mental hospital?” 

Pendleton smiled soberly. 

“There was no other course, 1 
was told. The Sheikh couldn't tol- 
erate being struck without severe 

36 



reprisal unless I was legally insane. 
Ergo, I was forced to accept the 
fiction of insanity. I was devilishly 
unhappy at first and kicked up 
quite a row. But Fve been treated 
with a fair degree of freedom here 
and promised that I’d be released 
in two years. March thirtieth of 
the coming year is my departure 
date.” 

I must admit that the entire nar- 
rative had been delivered with such 
plausibility that almost anyone 
could have been taken in. I say al- 
most because one of the cardinal 
phenomena in paranoia is the air 
of complete truth that often sur- 
rounds the tale. Nevertheless I felt 
impelled to ask one more ques- 
tion. 

“Did you suggest any sort of 
explanation of who or what might 
be removing the fifth planet to the 
Sheikh?” ' 

For the first time that afternoon 
Pendleton fell silent. He sat there 
quietly, the criss-crossed shadows 
of the window blinds slanting 
across his chest. For a long time 
he seemed uncertain of what to 
say. 

“I did offer a theory,” said Pen- 
dleton at last. “And since that 
time I've read and observed care- 
fully right here at the hospital — 
and I’m fully convinced that my 
earlier conjectures were correct. 
But I’m afraid of antagonizing 
them again. Who knows what they 
would do to me?” 

They} 



IF 




A shiver of realization coursed 
up my spine, a sensation I had ex- 
perienced before only during my 
childhood. The thread had begun 
to unravel as, in fact, it always 
does in situations of this sort. 

“Come on,” I said firmly. 
“Whom are you talking about? 
Surely you’re perfectly safe here 
at Piltdown?” 

“Am I?” He smoothed the folds 
in his checkered robe. “At any 
rate. I’ve nothing more to say.” 

It was clear that the dialogue 
was over and although I had an- 
other question or two to ask, I 
withdrew. I was in a state of high 
excitement, almost turmoil. 1 went 
at once to Dr. Czento’s office to 
see if we might discuss the Pendle- 
ton story. I was elated to find that 
he was available to me. 

As I detailed my visit to Pendle- 
ton and the story of the two tab- 
lets, Dr. Czento’s lips twitched al- 
most as though he were on the 
verge of a smile. And yet, para- 
doxically, I sensed a fierce inner 
tension within him. Then 1 noticed 
that he was not wearing his Tam- 
muz pin. 

“Perhaps I ought to write out 
my evaluation of the visit with 
Pendleton,” I said, “so that you 
can read it at your leisure.” 

“No,” said Dr. Czento firmly. 
“I do not wish a written report.” 

“Pendleton says that he’s to be 
released on March thirtieth, 
next.” 

Dr. Czento shook his head. 



“I have talked to Pendleton 
many times. He is severely para- 
noid, delusional. In short he’s as 
mad as they come with a severe 
and unpredictable temper. Perhaps 
he will be released. His family is 
wealthy, influential. If they insist 
on getting him released on their 
own responsibility there’s nothing 
I can do.” 

“I suppose not,” I said. 

I realized from the way Dr. 
Czento bent over his papers that 
he wanted me to leave. 

I SOUGHT out other patients 
during the days that followed* 
But I couldn’t fully concentrate on 
what I was doing. Mr. Turner, an 
elderly, senile country squire with 
a bulbous nose and pronounced 
anti-Semitic tendencies loved to 
browse through .the psychiatric lit- 
erature. He gave me a nasty turn 
one day when he suggested that 
Jews were prone to hebephrenia. I 
was able to weather that remark 
but I still couldn’t get my mind off 
Pendleton and his orrery. 

Our library was rich in popular 
scientific works and I selected one 
on modern astronomy. The chap- 
ter on the origin of the solar sys- 
tem was amusing because I noted 
that many authorities conjectured 
that Ceres and her sister asteroids 
were fragments of what had once 
been a fifth planet. How simple if 
that were the basis of Pendleton’s 
obsession. Later, during my morn- 
ing sessions with Dr. Czento, I 

37 



THE FIFTH PLANET 




found myself alluding now and 
then to the orrery. 

Dr. Czento, to my surprise, was 
suddenly hard put to throttle his 
anger. 

“I must say,” he began testily, 
“that you are showing an obsessive 
interest in this case. I suggest that 
you drop it at once. I believe that 
in some subtle way, you are actu- 
ally using it as a form of uncon- 
scious resistance to me by identify- 
ing yourself with this patient.” 

And I was shocked at how near- 
ly right he was. But what in Dr. 
Czento was I resisting? 

D URING the following week 
Dr. Czento was in London, 
attending an International Psychi- 
atric Congress and it occurred to 
me that perhaps the time was ripe 
to end my preoccupation with Pen- 
dleton. If only I could pursue my 
questioning a bit further. I tussled 
a while with the ethics of the mat- 
ter. And then I decided to hell with 
them. 

I found Pendleton in his room, 
the clutter considerably reduced. 

“I’m getting ready to leave, you 
see,” he told me, his face aglow 
with pleasure. 

“I’m very happy for you,” I said 
soberly. “I haven’t forgotten our 
conversation and I wish you had 
completed your story for me.” 

“But I did,” said Pendleton war- 
ily. 

“Not really. You never did tell 
me how your fifth planet came to 

38 



be in its current fragmented state.” 
Pendleton looked at me directly 
as though he wanted to peer into 
and beyond my eyes. 

“Can I really trust you?” 

I exploded. 

“Good God — if you can’t trust 
a British psychiatrist, whom can 
you trust?” 

He smiled wryly. 

“I wish you were right,” he said. 
“The fact is, I’m willing to tell 
you. But I’m afraid it might do 
you more harm than good.” 

“I’ll chance it.” 

He shrugged. 

“I believe that whoever was re- 
moving the fifth planet bungled the 
job. The result was the fragmen- 
ting we now see in the heavens. I 
daresay there were other terrible 
effects here on Earth— earth- 
quakes, perhaps a flood.” 

“Why were you afraid to tell me 
this?” 

He bent over and picked up his 
orrery, cranking its handle and 
sending the ten little balls about 
his model sun. 

“There are those who don’t 
want you to know,” he said. “And 
now, whether you like it or not, 
you’re no longer a spectator. 
You’re a potential threat. I don’t 
know why. I can’t really tell you 
what it’s all about. But if in a tiny 
recess of your mind you believe 
my story — take care.” 

It was finally clear to me that I 
had really played the fool. Per- 
haps, as Dr. Czento had suggested, 

IF 




my involvement was psychiatric 
defiance. The story was bizarre but 
classical in its veiled hints of vil- 
lains and threats. I blushed for 
shame, just thinking about my 
gullibility. 

O N DR. CZENTO’S return a 
gala modern art festival was 
held at Piltdown. Many unusual 
paintings and bizarre sculptures, 
some fashioned by patients, were 
exhibited. Dr. Czento, who person- 
ally supervised the entire affair, 
had an artist flown in from Paris. 
He created the most amazing 
painting by firing real bullets into 
bladders of paint that were sus- 
pended over a canvas. The piece de 
resistance was a wonderful ma- 
chine, aglitter with shining gears 
and motor-driven axe blades, 
which was set into motion by push- 
ing a button and thereupon pro- 
ceeded to demolish itself in a 
grinding clatter of metal in the 
acrid smoke of short-circuited 
wires. Dr. Czento clapped his 
hands with delight. I looked about 
for Pendleton but, reclusive as 
ever, he hadn’t even bothered to 
come to the show. 

The following day Pendleton 
was found dead in his room. There 
was no sign of violence and, in- 
deed, it seemed to be a clear case 
heart failure. Dr. Czento himself 
signed the papers certifying cause 
of death. Pendleton’s father came 
out to get the body. He was a tall, 
lean man, looking a good deal like 

THE FIFTH PLANET 



his son. His eyes were swollen 
when he stopped by to see me. 

“My son wrote about you. He 
thought you were a good sort. He 
wanted you to have this if anything 
happened to him.’’ 

He thrust the orrery into my 
hands. I was at a loss for some- 
thing appropriate to say. 

“I liked your son,’’ I finally 
managed. 

“He was a good lad,’’ said Mr. 
Pendleton. “We were planning on 
taking him home shortly. How 
long it would last we couldn’t tell. 
As you probably know, he has 
been in mental institutions many 
times before.’’ 

“Yes, I know,’’ I lied. 

But I hadn’t known and I won- 
dered why Dr. Czento hadn’t told 
me. 

Dr. Czento accompanied Mr. 
Pendleton to the railroad station. 
I walked about the grounds, carry- 
ing the orrery with me but unable 
to look at it. Then, on some mad 
whim, I decided to*get my hands 
on Pendleton’s file. I went to Dr’ 
Czento’s secretary and told her 
that, before leaving for the station, 
he had asked me to look at Pendle- 
ton’s case history. 

She seemed genuinely preplexed. 

“But I don’t know where that 
file is,’’ she said. “I believe that 
Dr. Czento keeps it locked up in 
his office. You’ll simply have to 
wait until he returns.’’ 

I couldn’t. At lunch time, when 
she had left the office, I opened 

39 




Dr. Czento’s door with a flat plas- 
tic pocket calendar. The drawn 
blinds and the musty odor of stale 
cigar smoke lent a rather other- 
worldly character to the room but 
I shook off my apprehensions and 
went poking about. The door lock 
had been simple but the desk 
drawers were beyond my amateur 
burglar skills. There was an ele- 
gant walnut cabinet between the 
picture windows. I walked over to 
it and, without much hope, slipped 
my calendar between the doors. 
There was a faint click and the 
doors fell open. But all I saw was 
an exquisite set of wine glasses and 
a decanter three quarters full with 
what looked and smelled like 
tawny port. I had lifted the stopper 
and the bouquet made my mouth 
water. As I started to replace the 
stopper I thought I heard a noise 
outside the office and the decanter 
shot out of my agitated hands, 
falling to the carpet. My luck was 
mixed. The decanter was unbroken 
but the carpet was stained and all 
of the port was gone. I went to the 
door and peered out but saw no 
one. I hastily went to Dr. Czento’s 
desk, gathered up facial tissues 
and sponged up as much of the 
mess as I could. 

What followed had nightmarish 
aspects. I knew that within mo- 
ments either Dr. Czento or his sec- 
retary might return. I ran to my 
room, dug out my own prize bot- 
tle of tawny port and raced back 
to Dr. Czento’s office. I poured 

40 



the port back into the decanter up 
to what seemed the right level, 
moved a waste basket over the 
sticky residue on the carpet, closed 
the cabinet and just avoided run- 
ning into the secretary. 

T HE afternoon went badly. I 
could focus on nothing. I had 
botched things in the most clumsy 
manner and had still learned noth- 
ing about Pendleton’s background. 

The next morning I tried to get 
out of my analytic session but Dr. 
Czento would have none of it. I 
lay uncomfortably on the didactic 
couch, unable to say a word. After 
several moments Dr. Czento spoke 
to me. 

“Are you still thinking of Pen- 
dleton?’’ he asked softly. 

“I am,’’ I admitted and then ev- 
erything burst out of me. 

I told iiim of my last meeting 
with Pendleton, the remarks of 
Pendleton’s father and the suspi- 
cions that had been aroused in my 
mind by Pendleton’s death. But I 
couldn’t bring myself to tell him 
how I had searched his office. 

Dr. Czento sighed. He got up 
and walked to one of his windows 
and looked out through a small 
opening in the blinds. Then he 
turned around and looked at me. 

“Get up off the couch,’’ he said. 
“No more therapy today.” 

“I’m concerned about you,” he 
said as I came forward to take a 
seat beside his desk. “I’ve begun to 
think of you as my eventual suc- 

IF 




cessor. Your flair for this field is 
undeniable. But you’ve become 
obsessive about poor Pendleton.” 

“His death shocked me terri- 
bly,” I said. “Besides, there was a 
persuasive quality to his delu- 
sions.” 

“Nonsense,” said Dr. Czento. 
“Pendleton was as psychotic as 
they come. His father told you 
how often he has been in hospitals. 
Besides, you’ve only to look at his 
files.” 

He reached down and unlocked 
one of his desk drawers, withdraw- 
ing a folder. He selected a sheaf of 
documents and pushed them to- 
ward me. I went through each one 
carefully. 

“You see what his previous 
medical history was?” said Dr. 
Czento. “He was constantly in and 
out of psychotic episodes. He had 
two years at Roundtree, three at 
Five Crossings and so on.” 

“Yes,” I said. “It’s all here. But 
might I look at the rest of his fold- 
er?” 

“You still have doubts?” 

Dr. Czento sighed and passed 
the folder to me. Then he stood 
up, walked to his cabinet and in- 
serted a small silver key in the 
lock. I was terrified that he would 
discover what had happened but he 
didn’t appear to notice the faint 
dark patch on the rug. When the 
doors swung open he removed the 
decanter and two glasses. 

“Come, have some of my port,” 
he said and it was clear that he 



earnestly wanted my friendship. I 
reached forward and took the glass 
of golden wine. It went down like 
the delight I knew it was. 

“Marvelous stuff, isn’t it?” said 
Dr. Czento. As yet he hadn’t 
sipped from his own glass and I 
held my breath. “Go ahead,” he 
said. “Read the rest of Pendleton’s 
folder.” 

He refilled my glass. I drank 
^and read on through the numer- 
ous sheets. One was an official 
piece of stationery of the Kingdom 
of Nahrum. Dr. Czento saw me 
stiffen. 

“There’s no contradiction,” he 
said, “in noting that a man was 
mad and still agreeing that he 
might stumble on a kernel of 
truth.” 

He withdrew his wallet and care- 
fully fished out the enameled pin 
with the white kid. 

“You asked me once about the 
Tammuz Society,” he said. “Do 
you know anything about it?” 

“I don’t know about the socie- 
ty,” I said. “But I have read about 
Tammuz. He was a Sumerian god 
of agriculture and flocks, wasn’t 
he?” 

Dr. Czento chuckled. 

“You might put it that way. I 
tend to see him as the first divinity 
of real estate.” 

I read on in the folder. There 
was a detailed official account of 
Pendleton’s visit to Nahrum. 

“Then Pendleton did do a trans- 
lation for the Sheikh,” I muttered. 



THE FIFTH PLANET 



41 




“After a fashion,” said Dr. 
Czento. “Pendleton was not really 
an expert in Sumerian. He was 
rather spotty in his knowledge de- 
spite his pretense to the contrary. 
Only his father’s intervention kept 
him in Eton. I grant you, the 
Sheikh did lie to him. He knew 
what was on the first tablet and 
was only testing Pendleton’s skill 
at translating Sumerian. When 
Pendleton botched the job he be- 
came justifiably outraged. Being 
unstable, Pendleton did hit the 
Shiekh and break his royal nose.” 

D R. CZENTO took out one of 
his elegant, slim Havana ci- 
gars and cut away the tip. He lit 
up and sent clouds of aromatic 
smoke in my direction. 

“The Sheikh,” he said, “con- 
siders himself an actual descendant 
of the god Tammuz and the first 
tablet contains his title to all of the 
heavenly bodies as well as the ac- 
count Pendleton mentioned. The 
second tablet told how the fifth 
planet was accidentally destroyed 
by extraterrestrial bunglers.” 
“What a lot of nonsense,” I said. 
Dr. Czento’s smile died away. 
“Not at all,” he said. “At the 
end of the second tablet was a 
statement giving permission to this 
same extraterrestrial group, the 
Sentients, to dismantle Mars. The 
agreement is made with the Tam- 
muz Society of which the Sheikh 
is a director. But he violated his 
trust, just to find out whether he 

42 



was getting his proper share of the 
gold.” 

“Gold?” 

“Mars is rich in gold,” said Dr. 
Czento. “The metal itself is not 
useful and any advanced society 
would much rather have the radio- 
active ores in which it abounds. If 
those who hold title to Mars al- 
low a second party to remove said 
ores, provided they deliver the gold 
as payment, who could blame 
them?” 

“Ridiculous,” I said. “How 
could men claim to own a planet?” 

“Is it less ridiculous for men to 
claim ownership of a mountain?” 
said Dr. Czento. 

I shook my head. 

“Is anything wrong?” asked Dr. 
Czento. He did not wait for an an- 
swer but went on. “The Sentients 
botched the job some three thou- 
sand years- ago. They lost their 
finest scientists and most advanced 
spaceships when the fifth planet 
disintegrated. They gave up their 
exploration in our Solar system 
and went elsewhere. But now 
they’ve exhausted other sources 
and have been forced to come back 
for another try. Fortunately their 
technology is vastly improved and 
when Mars is replaced, bit by bit, 
with an ultradense core of inert 
material, there is little danger of 
mishap.” 

“How did the Sentients contact 
your society?” 

“Reports of space vehicles land-

years ago and they didn’t renew it. 
They’ve stopped doing it to new 
recruits — no percentage in ber- 
serkers. I was a wild one the first 
couple of trips, though. 

Strange world I’ve come back 
to. Gets stranger every time, of 
course. Even sitting here in a bo- 
gus twenty-first-century bar, where 
everyone speaks Basic and there’s 
real wood on the walls and peace- 
ful holograms instead of plugins 
and music made by men. 

But it leaks through. I don’t 
pay by card, let alone by coin. 
The credit register monitors my 
alpha waves and communicates 
with the bank every time I order 
a drink. And, in case I’ve become 
addicted to more modern vices, 
there’s a feelie matrix — (modified 
to look like an old-fashioned visi- 
phone booth) — where I can have 
my brain stimulated directly. 
Thanks but no thanks — always get 
this picture of dirty hands inside 
my skull, kneading, rubbing. Like 
when you get too close to the en- 
emy and they open a hole in your 
mind and you go spinning down 
and down and never reach the bot- 



tom till you die. I almost got too 
close last time. 

W E WERE on a three-man re- 
connaissance patrol, bound 
for a hellish little planet circling 
the red giant Antares. Now red 
giant stars don’t form planets in 
the natural course of things, so 
we had ignored Antares. We con- 
trol most of the space around it, 
so why waste time in idle explor- 
ation? But the enemy had detected 
this little planet — God knows how 
— and about ten years after they 
landed there we monitored their 
presence — gravity waves from the 
ships’ braking — and my team was 
assigned the reconnaissance. Three 
men against many enemy. But we 
weren’t supposed to fight if we 
could help it — just take a look 
around, record what we saw and 
leave a message beacon on our 
way back, about a light-year out 
from Antares. Theoretically the 
troopship following us by a month 
will pick up the information and 
use it to put together a battle plan. 
Actually, three more recon pa- 
trols precede the troopship at one- 
week intervals; insurance against 
the high probability that any one 
patrol will be caught and de- 
stroyed. As the first team in, we 
had a pretty good chance of suc- 
cess but the ones to follow would 
be in trouble if we didn’t get back 
out. We’d be past caring, of 
course. The enemy doesn’t take 
prisoners.

IF 




We came out of lightspeed close 
to Antares, so the bulk of the star 
would mask our braking distur- 
bance, and inserted the ship in a 
hyperbolic orbit that would get us 
to the planet — Anomaly, we were 
calling it — in about twenty hours. 

“Anomaly must be tropical over 
most of its surface.” Fred Sykes, 
nominally the navigator, was talk- 
ing to himself and at the two of us 
while he analyzed the observation- 
al date rolling out of the ship’s 
computer. “No axial tilt to speak 
of. Looks like they’ve got a big 
outpost near the equator, lots of 
electromagnetic noise there. Fi- 
gures — the goddamn snails like it 
hot. We requisitioned hot weather 
gear, didn’t we, Pancho?” 

Pancho, that’s me. “No, Fred, 
all we got is parkas and snow- 
shoes.” My full name is Francis^ 
Jesus Mario Juan-Jose Hugo uw 
Naranja and I outrank Fred, so 
he should at least call me Francis- 
co. But I’ve never pressed the 
point. Pancho it is. Fred looked up 
from his Figures and the rookie, 
Paul Spiegel, almost dropped the 
pistol he was cleaning. 

“But why — ” Paul was staring. 
“We knew the planet was prob- 
ably earthlike if the enemy wanted 
it. Are we gonna have to go tromp- 
ing around in spacesuits?” 

“No, Paul, our esteemed lead- 
er and supply clerk is being sar- 
castic again.” Fred turned back to 
his computer. “Explain, Pancho.” 
“No, that’s all right.” Paul red- 



dened a bit and also went back to 
his job. “I remember you com- 
plaining about having to take the 
standard survival issue.” 

“Well, I was right then and I’m 
doubly right now. We’ve got par- 
kas back there — and snowshoes 
and a complete terranorm envi- 
ronment recirculator — and every- 
thing else we could possibly need 
to walk around irr comfort on 
every planet known to man — Dios\ 
That issue masses over a metric 
ton, more than a bevawatt laser. 
A laser we could use but cram- 
pons and pith helmets and ele- 
phant guns — ” 

Paul looked up again. “Ele- 
phant guns?” He was kind of a 
freak about weapons. 

“Yeah.” 

“That’s a gun that shoots ele- 
1 -ts?” 

ht. An elephant gun shoots 
cicpnants.” 

“Is that some new kind of am- 
munition?” 

I sighed, I really sighed. You’d 
think I’d get used to this after 
twelve years — or four hundred — 
in the service. 

“No, kid, elephants were ani- 
mals, big gray wrinkled animals 
with horns. You used an elephant 
gun to shoot at them. 

“When I was a kid in Rioplex, 
back in the twenty-first, we had 
an elephant in the zoo — used to 
go down in the summer and feed 
him synthos through the bars. He 
had a long nose like a fat tail.”

“What planet were they from?” 

I T WENT on like that for a while. 

It was Paul’s first trip out and 
he hadn’t yet gotten used to the 
idea that most of his compatriots 
were genuine antiques, preserved 
by the natural process of relativ- 
ity. At lightspeed you age imper- 
ceptibly, while the universe’s cal- 
endar adds a year for every light- 
year you travel. Seems like cheat- 
ing. But it catches up with you 
eventually. 

We hit the atmosphere of Ano- 
maly at an oblique angle and came 
in passive, like a natural meteor, 
until we got to a position where 
we were reasonably safe from de- 
tection — (just above the south po- 
lar sea) — then blasted briefly to 
slow down and splash. Then we 
spent a few hours in slow fligh* ^ 
sea level, sneaking up on th 
tlement. 

It appeared to be the only en- 
emy camp on the whole planet, 
which was typical. Strange for a 
spacefaring, aggressive race to be 
so uncurious about planetary en- 
vironments but they always 
seemed to settle in one place and 
simply expand radially. And they 
do expand — their reproduction 

rate makes rabbits look sick. 
Starting from one colony they can 
fill a world in two hundred years. 
After that they control their pop- 
ulation by infantiphage and stellar 
migration. 

We landed about a hundred 



kilometers from the edge of their 
colony, around local midnight. 
While we were outside, setting up 
the espionage monitors. The ship 
camouflaged itself to match the 
surrounding jungle optically, ther- 
mally, magnetically and so forth 
— we were careful not to get too 
far from the ship; it can be a bit 
hard to find even when you know 
where to look. 

The monitors were to be fed in- 
formation from flea-sized flying 
robots, each with a special pur- 
pose, and it would take several 
hours for them to wing into the 
city. We posted a one-man guard, 
one-hour shifts; the other two in- 
side the ship until the monitors 
started clicking. Bat they never 
started. 

Being senior, I took the first 

atch. A spooky hour, the jungle 
ving ,dark little noises all 
around — but nothing happened. 
Fred stood the next hour, while I 
put on the deepsleep helmet. Fig- 
ured I’d need the sleep — once data 
started coming in, I’d have to be 
alert for about forty hours. We 
could all sleep for a week once we 
got off Anomaly and hit light- 
speed. 

Getting yanked out of deepsleep 
is like an ice-water douche to the 
brain. The black nothing dissolved 
and there was Fred a foot away 
from my face, yelling my name 
over and over. As soon as he saw 
my eyes open he ran for the open 
lock, priming his laser on the way

IF 




(definitely against regulations, 
could hole the hull that way — I 
started to say something but 
couldn’t form the words). Any- 
how, what were we doing in free 
fall? And how could Fred run 
across the deck like that while we 
were in free fall? 

Then my mind started coming 
back into focus and I could ana- 
lyze the sinking, spinning sensation 
— not free-fall vertigo at all but 
what we used to call snail-fever. 
The enemy was very near. Crack- 
ling combat sounds drifted in from 
outdoors. 



I SAT up on the cot and tried to 
sort everything out and get go- 
ing. After long seconds my arms 
and legs got the idea. I struggled 
up and staggered to the weapons 
cabinet. Both the lasers were gone 
and the only heavy weapon left 
was a grenade launcher. I lifted it 
from the rack and made my way 
to the lock. 

Had I been thinking straight I 
would’ve just sealed the lock and 
blasted — the presence in my mind 
was so strong that I should have 
known there were too many en- 
emy, too close, for us to stand 
and fight. But no one can think 
while his brain is being curdl'ed 
that way. I fought the urge just to 
let go and fall down that hole in 
my mind and slid along the wall to 
the airlock. By the time I got there 
my teeth were chattering uncon- 



trollably and my face was wet with 
tears. 

Looking out, I saw a smolder- 
ing gray lump that must have 
been Paul. Fred was screaming 
like a madman, fanning the laser 
on full over a 180-degree arc. 
There couldn’t have been anything 
alive in front of him — the jungle 
was a lurid curtain of fire — but 
a bolt lanced in from behind and 
Fred dissolved in a pink spray of 
blood and flesh. 

I saw them then, moving fast 
for snails, shambling in over thick 
brush toward the ship. Through 
the swirling fog in my brain I rea- 
lized that all they could see was 
the light pouring through the open 
lock and me silhouetted in front. 
I tried to raise the launcher but 
couldn’t — there were too many, 
less than a hundred meters away, 
and the inky whirlpool in my mind 
just got bigger and bigger and I 
could feel myself slipping into it. 

The first bolt missed me, hit 
the ship and it shuddered, ringing 
like a huge cathedral bell. The sec- 
ond one didn’t miss. It took off 
my left hand just above the wrist, 
roasting what remained of my left 
arm. In a spastic lurch I jerked up 
the launcher and yanked the trig- 
ger, holding it down while dozens 
of microton grenades popped out 
and danced their blinding way up 
to and across the enemy’s ragged 
line. Dazzled, blind, I stepped back 
and stumbled over the med-robot, 
which had smelled blood and was 



TIME PIECE 



47 




eager to do its duty. On top of the 
machine was a switch that some 
clown had labeled Emergency 
Exit. I slapped it and as the lock 
clanged shut the atomic engines 
muttered — growled — screamed in- 
to life and a ten-gravity hand slid 
me across the blood-slick deck 
and slammed me back against the 
rear-wall padding. I felt ribs crack 
and something in my neck 
snapped. As the world squeezed 
away I knew I was a dead man 
but it was better to die in a bed of 
pain than to just fall and fall. 

I WOKE to the less-than-tender 
ministrations of the med-ro- 
bot, who had bound the stump of 
my left arm and was wrapping my 
chest in plastiseal. My body from 
forehead to shins ached from ra- 
diation bums, earned by facing 
the grenades’ bursts. The non- 
existent hand seemed to writhe in 
painful, impossible contortions. 
But numbing anaesthetic kept the 
pain at a bearable distance and 
there was an empty space in my 
mind where the snail-fever had 
been. A gentle hum told me we 
were at lightspeed — things could 
have been one flaming hell of a 
lot worse. Fred and Paul were 
gone but that just moved them 
from the small roster of live 
friends to the long list of dead ones. 

A warning light on the control 
panel was blinking stroboscopi- 
cally. We were getting near the 
hole — excuse me, “relativistic dis- 



continuity — ’’ and the computer 
had to know where I wanted to go. 
You go in one hole at lightspeed 
and you’ll come out of some oth- 
er hole. Which hole you pop out 
of depends on your angle of ap- 
proach. Since they say that only 
about one per cent of the holes are 
charted — if you go in at any old 
angle you’re likely to wind up in 
Podunk, on the other side of the 
galaxy, with no ticket back. 

I just let the light blink, though. 
If it doesn’t get any response from 
the crew the ship programs itself 
automatically to go to Heaven, 
the hospital world, which was fine 
with me. They cure what ails you 
and then set you loose with a com- 
patible soldier of the opposite sex, 
for an extended vacation on that 
beautiful world. Someone once 
told me that there were over a 
hundred worlds named Hell — but 
there’s only one Heaven. Clean 
and pretty from the tropical seas 
to the subpolar pine forests. Like 
Earth, before we strangled it. 

A bell had been ringing all the 
time I’d been conscious, but I 
didn’t notice it until it stopped. 
That meant the information cap- 
sule had been jettisoned, for what 
little it was worth. Planetary in- 
formation, very few espionage- 
type data; just a tape for the bat- 
tle. Be rough for the next recon 
patrol. 

I fell asleep knowing I’d wake 
up on the other side of the hole, 
bound for Heaven.

1 PICK up my drink — an old- 
fashioned old-fashioned — with 
my new left hand. The glass 
should feel right, slick but slightly 
tacky with the cold-water sweat, 
fine ridges molded into the plastic. 
But there’s something missing, 
hard to describe, a memory stored 
in your fingertips that a new 
growth has to learn all over again. 
It’s a strange feeling but in a way 
it seems to fit with this crazy 
Earth, where I sit in my alcoholic 
time capsule and, if I squint with 
my mind, can almost believe I’m 
back in the twenty-first. 

I pay for the nostalgia— wood 
and natural food, human barten- 
der and waitress who are also lin- 
guists, it all comes dear — but I 
can afford it if anyone can. Com- 
pound interest, of course. Over 
four centuries have passed on 
Earth since I first went off to the 
war and my salary’s been depos- 
ited at the Chase-Manhattan Cred- 
it Union ever since. They’re glad 
to do it — when I die they keep the 
interest and the principal reverts 
to the government. Heirs? I had 
one illegitimate son — conceived on 
my first furlough — and when I 
last saw his gravestone, the words 
on it had washed away to barely 
legible dimples. 

But I’m still a young man. At 
lightspeed you age imperceptibly 
while the universe winds down out- 
side and the time you spend going 
from hole to hole is almost in- 
calculably small. I’ve spent most 



of the past half-millennium at 
lightspeed, the rest of the time 
usually convalescing from battle. 
My records show that I’ve logged 
a trifle under one year in actual 
combat. Not bad for 438 years’ 
pay. Since I first lifted off I’ve 
aged twelve years by my biological 
calendar. Complicated, isn’t it — 
next month I’ll be thirty, 456 years 
after my date of birth. 

But one week before my birth- 
day, I’ve got to decide whether to 
try my luck for the fourth trip out, 
or just collect my money and re- 
tire. No choice, really. I’ve got to 
go back. 

It’s something they didn’t em- 
phasize when I joined up, back in 
2088 — maybe it wasn’t so obvious 
back then, the war only decades 
old — but they can’t hide it now- 
adays. Too many old vets wan- 
dering around like animated mu- 
seum pieces. 

I could cash in my chips and 
live in luxury for another hundred 
years. But it would get mighty 
lonely. Can’t talk to anybody on 
Earth but other vets and people 
who’ve gone to the trouble to 
learn Basic. 

Everyone in space speaks Basic. 
You can’t lift off until you’ve be- 
come fluent. Otherwise, how could 
you take orders from a fellow who 
should have been food for worms 
centuries before your grandfather 
was born? Especially since lan- 
guage melted down into one Lan- 
guage.

I’m tone-deaf. Can’t speak or 
understand Language, where one 
word has ten or fifteen different 
meanings, depending on pitch. To 
me it sounds like puppydogs yap- 
ping. Same words over and over — 
no sense. 

Of course, when I first lived on 
Earth there were all sorts of lan- 
guages, not just one Language. I 
spoke Spanish — still do when I 
can find some other old codger 
who remembers — and learned En- 
glish — that was before they called 
it Basic — in military training. 
Learned it damn well, too. If I 
wasn’t tone-deaf I’d crack Lan- 
guage and maybe I’d settle down. 

M AYBE not. The people are 
so strange and it’s not just 
the Language. Mindplugs and ho- 
mosex and voluntary suicide. 
Walking around with nothing on 
but paint and powder'. We had 
Fullerdomes when I was a kid — 
but you didn’t have to live under 
one. Now if you take a walk out 
in the country for a breath of fresh 
air, you’ll drop dead before you 
can exhale. 

My mind keeps dragging me 
back to Heaven. I’d retire in a 
minute if I could spend my re- 
maining century there. Can’t, of 
course — only soldiers allowed in 
space. And the only way a soldier 
gets to Heaven is the hard way. 

I’ve been there three times — 
once more and I’ll set a record. 
That’s motivation of a sort, I sup- 



pose. Also, in the unlikely event 
that I should live another five 
years, I’ll get a commission and a 
desk job if I live through my term 
as a field officer. Doesn’t happen 
too often — but there aren’t too 
many desk jobs that people can 
handle better than cyborgs. 

That’s another alternative. If 
my body gets too garbaged for 
regeneration and they can save 
enough of my brain, I could spend 
the rest of eternity hooked up to 
a computer, as a cyborg. The only 
one I’ve ever talked to seemed to 
be happy. 

I once had an African partner, 
named N’gai. He taught me how 
to play O’wari, a game older than 
manoply or even chess. We sat in 
this very bar — or the identical one 
that was in its place two hundred 
years ago — and he tried to impress 
on my non-Zenoriented mind just 
how significant this game was to 
men in our position. 

You start out with forty-eight 
smooth little pebbles, four in each 
one of the twelve depressions that 
make up the game board. Then 
you take turns, scooping the peb- 
bles out of one hole and distribut- 
ing them one-at-a-time in holes to 
the left. If you dropped your last 
pebble in a hole where your oppo- 
nent had only one or two, why, you 
got to take those pebbles off the 
board. Sounds exciting, doesn’t 
it? 

But N’gai sat there in a cloud of

Dillingham's assistant had to be 
land-going, esthetic, competent, 
free and female — more than less! 



51 



D OCTOR, you need an assis- 
tant,” Oyster said. He had re- 
tracted almost entirely into his 
shell for an executive snooze but 
the ubiquitous translators picked 
up his watery mumble and spewed 
it out full-volume in English. 

An assistant? Dillingham had 
already come to that conclusion. 
He sat behind a towering mound 
of paperwork, unable properly to 
attend to his duties as Assistant 
Director of the School of Prostho- 
dontics, Galactic University of 
Dentistry. In fact, he could not al- 
ways remember his official title 
correctly, with so much else clut- 
tering his mind. At any moment 
he could be shot off on some sim- 
ple assignment that invariably 
turned out to be murderously 
complex in detail. He felt edgy. 

Actually, no paper was involved. 
But computerized busywork and 
multilingual red tape amounted to 
the same thing. Every tiny plastic 
card of the thousands on his desk 
represented some problem of 
some student that he had to rectify 
in some manner. Yes, he needed 
help on the interminable details of 
his office. He had had no assistant 
since leaving Earth so precipitous- 
ly and unexpectedly and he had 
never fully adapted to that lack. 
He wished he could take a mid- 
session snooze, as Oyster was do- 
ing now. 

Oyster was the Director of the 
School of Prosthodontics, a posi- 
tion Dillingham would eventually 

52 



assume — if he didn’t first suffer 
an intellectual breakdown. Oys- 
ter’s assistant was Miss Tarantu- 
la, a marvel of arachnid efficiency. 
In the office or the operatory, at 
the University or in the field, her 
eight arms seemed to tie up every 
loose thread before it appeared. It 
was because of her that Oyster’s 
desk was clear and Dillingham re- 
alized jealously that if he had an 
assistant even half as competent 
his own desk would soon be re- 
lieved of its burden. Yet she 
tended to make him nervous, de- 
spite his efforts to repress his 
Earthly prejudices. She was not 
really a man-sized spider. 

Oyster poked an antenna out of 
his shell. 

“Set up a series of interviews 
for a prospective assistant,” he 
said to her. “Land-going, esthetic, 
competent, 'unattached, female — ” 

“The first is waiting in the ante- 
room,” Miss Tarantula said. That 
was the way she was — anticipa- 
tory. “If Dr. Dillingham cares to 
interview her now — ” 

“But there’s no point in merely 
talking with her,” Dillingham pro- 
tested. “I have field assignments^ 
as well as office routine. I have to 
know how she functions in a vari- 
ety of situations, particularly un- 
der stress. If—” 

“Naturally,” Miss Tarantula 
said. “You are scheduled to make 
a promotional tour of planet Hob- 
goblin today. She will accompany 
you on a trial basis.” 



IF 




“But that’s not a stress situa- 
tion. A routine visit — ” 

“The director also wishes you 
to investigate certain complaints 
of a sensitive nature.” 

S O NOW it came out. The rea- 
son for his edginess. Debating 
points with Miss Tarantula was 
futile. The slightest twitch of her 
hairy front leg brought the web 
tight. And Oyster was no slouch at 
making things routinely impossi- 
ble — he seemed to feel that this 
was good practice for the Direc- 
torship. Certain complaints of a 
sensitive nature? That meant that 
half a misstep could result in a 
lynching. 

Well, he thought, glancing at 
the tremendous metal man stand- 
ing immobile in the corner, a 
lynching was the last thing he had 
to fear. This huge robot, the Jann, 
would blast apart anything like 
that. Literally. The Jann’s meticu- 
lous guardianship was not entirely 
welcome but was a fact of Dilling- 
ham’s new life. If there were trou- 
ble on Hobgoblin, all that would 
suffer would be the troublemakers. 
Plus Dillingham’s professional 
reputation and that of the Univer- 
sity. The very reputations his tour 
was supposed to enhance. 

He felt a headache coming on. 
“All right. Brief her and — ” 

“All taken care of, Doctor,” 
Miss Tarantula said. 

Naturally. It was not that she 
was helping Dillingham — she was 

EQUALS FOUR 



hardly concerned with bipedal 
mammals — it was that her boss 
had made a directive and she was 
being efficient. 

The door opened. A grotesque 
mound of warty blubber slid into 
the office. It drifted to rest before 
Dillingham, smelling of castor oil. 
A black orifice gaped. 

“So pleased to meet you. Doc- 
tor D,” the translator said. “I am 
Miss Porkfat, your trial-basis as- 
sistant.” 

Esthetic , competent, female . 

Dillingham had no doubt that 
by the standards of her own spe- 
cies Miss Porkfat was all of these. 
And he could not afford to ques- 
tion any of it, lest he betray an un- 
University prejudice of taste. 

“Very good, Miss P,” he said. 
“Please arrange passage for three 
to Planet Hobgoblin and notify 
the authorities there of our itiner- 
ary.” 

“Three, Doctor?” Her voice, 
audible just beneath the transla- 
tion, was pleasantly modulated, at 
least. 

“Three. The Jann will be com- 
ing along.” 

She extruded a snaillike eye- 
stalk. The orb focused on the shin- 
ing robot. A quiver started there 
and traveled down her body before 
it damped out. 

“Yes, Doctor.” 

She oozed over to a private-line 
translator, asked for interplane- 
tary and began making the ar- 
rangements. 

53 




Grade A, so far, Dillingham 
thought as Oyster woke and 
smiled benignly from inside his 
shell. The Jann robots were sup- 
posed to have become extinct sev- 
eral thousand years ago but their 
terrible reputation lingered on in 
galactic folklore. Miss Porkfat 
had excellent presence if her only 
reaction to the sight of a function- 
ing Jann was one eyeball-quiver. 

But still she reminded him of in- 
fected slug-meat. 

T HE Hobgoblins were surly 
creatures — short, big-headed, 
flat-footed, ugly by humanoid 
standards. 

“What's that Jann doing here?" 
the customs official demanded in a 
whine that even the translator 
caught. “We don't allow sentient 
robots on our planet.’’ 

“He has to travel with me," Dil- 
lingham said. The truth was too 
complicated to explain. 

The official gestured to the 
guards. 

“Put this tin in the cooler." 

The squat troopers advanced on 
the huge metal creature. Dilling- 
ham saw trouble coming but was 
powerless to circumvent it. The 
Jann was as deadly a sentient as 
the galaxy had ever known and 
had sworn to protect Dillingham 
for fifty years. To do that, he had 
to stay close. Evidently the inhab- 
itants of this planet had little re- 
spect for past reputations or they 
would never have gone near the 
Jann. 

54 



The uniformed goblins took 
hold of the Jann’s arms. They 
were barely able to reach up that 
far and looked like squat children 
beside a stern parent. They tugged. 

That was all. The Jann did not 
budge or take overt note of them. 
Fortunately. 

Dillingham and Miss Porkfat, 
having completed their business at 
customs, left. The Jann followed, 
nonchalantly dragging along the 
two guards. After a while they let 
go- 

So much for protocol. Dilling- 
ham sighed with relief that the ro- 
bot had not lost his metal temper. 

The Hobgoblin office of Den- 
tistry was imposing enough, exter- 
nally. But inside the fine large 
building were distressingly back- 
ward facilities. This planet still 
used mechanical drills, X-rays and 
needle-injected anesthetics. A har- 
ried goblin technician galloped up. 

“What do you want? We don’t 
allow visitors in here. Particularly 
aliens." 

“This is the representative from 
the University of Dentistry," Miss 
Porkfat said dulcetly. The nearest 
translator was down the hall a dis- 
tance, so conversation was remote. 
“On a promotional tour. Your of- 
fice was informed." 

“I don’t need any offworld tub 
of lard to tell me of what we’ve 
been informed. Come back next 
week. We’re busy now." 

Miss Porkfat turned to Dilling- 
ham, her eyestalk quivering again. 

IF 




“They prefer that we return next 
week, Doctor.D.” 

Something about the exchange 
rankled. “I heard, Miss P. But this 
was cleared with the authorities 
before we arrived and my schedule 
does not permit a postponement.” 

“It will have to be today,” she 
informed the technician. 

“Go fry your posterior.” 

“I really think — ” 

“I’ll handle it, Miss P,” Dilling- 
ham said, his ire rising. He was 
not a temperamental man but his 
position did not allow him to tol- 
erate much insolence. Miss Pork- 
fat was being gentle when she 
should have been firm. 

“You don’t have confidence in 
me,” she protested, beginning to 
quiver all over. 

“It isn’t that, Miss P — ” 

“Why should he, blubbertub?” 
the goblin demanded. 

“I’m only trying to — ” she be- 
gan, turning pink. On her, this was 
impressive. 

“Of course,” Dillingham said 
diplomatically. “But in this 
case — ” 

“ Will you creeps get out of 
here?” 

“No!” Dillingham shouted at 
the ugly face. 

Miss Porkfat began to dissolve. 
Literally. 

“I think this position is unsuit- 
able for you, Miss P,” Dillingham 
said with as much compassion as 
he was able to muster in the cir- 
cumstance: “If you wish to return 
EQUALS FOUR 



to the University and seek an on- 
campus placement — ” 

She sucked herself together 
somewhat. “Thank you, Doctor 

D.” 

“Good riddance, stinky,” the 
goblin said. 

Dillingham walked hautily by 
him, though privately he suspected 
that the goblin was right. This was 
no job for an assistant who melted 
in the face of conflict with abrasive 
personalities. 

“Watch where you’re going, 
stupid,” the goblin yelled. “I said 
no visitors. I’ll clobber you — ” 

T HAT was his mistake. The 
Jann, silent until now, boomed 
into animation. 

“None but I shall do him die — 
forty-nine years, five months, thir- 
teen days hence, Earthtime,” it 
proclaimed. 

By the time the words ceased re- 
verberating the goblin was gone, 
thoroughly cowed. 

A non-native was waiting in the 
next alcove. Willowy, sweet-smell- 
ing, with a cluster of slender blue 
tentacles and four soft purple eyes 
— quite esthetic, in a surrealistic 
way. 

“Doctor Dillingham? I was sent 
by the University to assist you on 
a trial basis. I am Miss Anem- 
one.” 

So Miss Tarantula had antici- 
pated his problem with Miss Pork- 
fat. Such comprehension was 
frightening.

“Very good,” he said. Then, 
thinking ahead: “This is a Jann. 
He’s traveling with us.” 

“I observed him. A handsome 
specimen. I hadn’t been aware they 
made robots of that caliber any- 
more.” 

No loss of control there! Dil- 
lingham glanced down the hall. 

“And approaching us is another 
native technician.” 

The Hobgoblin wore a badge of 
rank that distinguished him as an 
entity of moderate authority. 

“No visitors permitted. Leave 
at once.” 

Miss Anemone braced him 
squarely. “This is the Assistant 
Director of the University School 
of—” 

“Don’t waste my time with your 
ridiculous apologies,” the goblin 
said brusquely. “Just get out.” 

“If you will check our approved 
itinerary — ” 

“One side, sea-spook.’’ The 
goblin shouldered by her, intent on 
Dillingham. He did not get far. 
“Ouch!” 

“Oh dear me, I’m so sorry,” 
she said solicitously. “Did my 
spines hurt you? I hope you will 
report to the infirmary right away. 
I certainly wouldn’t want the toxin 
to get into your system.” 

She led the way on down the 
hall while the goblin rushed off, 
rubbing his shoulder. 

So far, so. good. Miss Anemone 
was not unduly sensitive to abuse 
or helpless before it. 



They arrived at the main dem- 
onstration room. Here the won- 
ders of modern Hobgoblian den- 
tistry were displayed — quaint 
metal restorations, classic plastic 
dentures, primitive color X-ray 
photographs. Dillingham viewed 
them politely, then approached the 
goblin in charge and began his 
presentation. 

“I believe the University can 
enhance aspects of your proce- 
dure—” 

“Who asked it to?” 

Dillingham was not free to men- 
tion the several tourists who had 
complained to the University. 
That was the sensitive part of his 
tour. The described symptoms had 
been vague and diverse, so that no 
consistent pattern had developed 
and no complainer had actually 
reported for a University recheck. 
Thus there' was no solid evidence 
that Hobgoblian dentistry was at 
fault — just a statistical suspicion. 

The kind of thing that had to be 
investigated unobtrusively, for 
planet Hobgoblin was sensitive 
about alien criticism. 

“Perhaps a demonstration of 
technique — ” he suggested. 

“Oh, so the marvelous Univer- 
sity desk jockey wishes to show the 
outworld peons how to practice — ” 
Dillingham ignored this. “We 
might take a look at some of your 
problem patients. Naturally, if 
I can demonstrate the advantages 
of University training — ” 

“Training, schmaining! If we

56 




had your finances we could af- 
ford a multi-species dontic analy- 
zer, too, and have instant diag- 
nosis of every — ” 

“You are correct in your im- 
plication that the analyzer is one 
of our more important diagnos- 
tic tools. But since it is far too ex- 
pensive for the average facility we 
stress the raw ability of the indi- 
vidual dentist using local equip- 
ment. It is the talent that remains 
after the—” 

But the goblin did not let him 
repeat the maxim he had learned so 
forcefully from Oyster. 

“You claim you can use my 
equipment — and do a better job 
than I can?” 

Since courtesy did not seem to 
accomplish much here, Dilling- 
ham abandoned it. Unwisely. 

“Yes. And so could any Uni- 
versity graduate.” 

The goblin swelled with rage — 
then made an unholy smile. 

“You’re on, Doc.” 

H E WAS, indeed, on. In half 
an hour Dillingham was en- 
sconced in a model unit set up on 
a stage in an amphitheater. Miss 
Anemone had a desk a few paces 
away and the Jann had a separate 
booth where he could watch for 
Dillingham’s safety without ob- 
structing the view of the audience. 
Goblin spectators, every one a 
trained dentist, filled the hall. 

This was more than Dillingham 
had bargained for, and he made a 

EQUALS FOUR 



mental note never again to speak 
precipitously. Meanwhile he had 
to follow through. Somehow 
things always did become com- 
plicated. He was almost getting 
used to it. 

“The prosthodontic genius from 
Galactic U will now demonstrate 
how to handle a problem case,” 
the dental chief announced grand- 
ly. “Pay close attention, so you 
can learn how stupid you are.” 
Almost every grotesque little 
face mirrored the chiefs resent- 
ment. No doubt of it — University 
prestige was on the line. Dilling- 
ham could, in fact, be eased out 
of the very University position he 
was in training for. The goblins 
were striking, not at him but at 
his career — a blow the Jann would 
not foil. All because of one in- 
temperate remark. 

The first patient mounted the 
stage — a vaguely equine quadruped 
with colorful, birdlike plumage. 

Miss Anemone intercepted it. 
“May I have your name and plan- 
et of origin, please?” 

“Horsefeathers of Clovenhoof,” 
the creature neighed, showing tre- 
mendous yellow teeth. 

“Please describe your com- 
plaint.” 

“My teeth hurt.” 

A murmur of nasty apprecia- 
tion rose from the audience. Hob- 
goblin’s finest practitioners were 
present and Dillingham was sure 
that every one of them had had 
this problem — the unspecific re- 



57 




sponse. Miss Anemone, of course, 
would not let it stand at that. She 
would question the patient gently 
but firmly, clarifying and isolat- 
ing his symptoms until she had a 
fair notion of his real complaint. 
A major part of the duties of a 
galactic dental assistant was to get 
the facts straight before the pa- 
tient ever saw the dentist, thereby 
promoting office efficiency. 

“Doctor Dillingham will see 
you now,” she said. 

A chorous of chuckles and a 
few hoots came from the audience. 
They knew she had goofed and he 
could not afford to correct her 
now. To do so would only make 
matters worse. He would have to 
question the patient himself— and 
make sure never to get into such a 
situation again with an unfamiliar 
assistant. 

The fault probably was* not hers. 
Some dentists preferred to handle 
virtually everything themselves and 
some assistants were trained to 
honor the practice. Probably she 
would have questioned the patient 
further had he asked her to do so. 
But Dillingham was far too busy 
to break in an assistant in all the 
little ways that were sure to turn 
up. 

Miss Anemone would not do. 

Horsefeathers ambled over and 
bestrode the dental chair, opening 
his long large mouth. His breath 
was not sweet. 

“Can you localize the area of 
sensitivity?” Dillingham inquired, 

58 



beginning a routine check with the 
probe. 

“Huh?” 

“Where does it hurt?” 

“They all hurt. It changes,” 
Horsefeathers said. 

Another appreciative goblin 
chuckle. Dillingham began to fear 
that they had thrown him a chron- 
ic complainer — one who would 
object no matter how well off his 
teeth were. 

“I see you have had extensive 
prosthodontic restoration,” Dill- 
ingham observed. Indeed, the 
mouth was a mass of gold. 

“Huh?” 

“Lot of work done on you.” 

“Yes. All right here on Hob- 
goblin. Lousy job.” 

Silence from the gallery. Dill- 
ingham suppressed a smile. 

“On the contrary. My visual 
inspectiofi suggests that this work 
is quite competent. However, I 
shall take X-rays to be sure there 
is no underlying problem.” He 
tapped a tooth, finding it firm. 
“Miss Anemone — ” 

Another evil gallery chuckle. 
He looked up. 

Miss Anemone was gone. A 
man-sized centipede occupied her 
desk. 

“I am Miss Thousandlegs, your 
new assistant. Miss Anemone was 
called away.” 

In the middle of a demonstra- 
tion? Miss Tarantula was becom- 
ing too efficient. How had she 
known? 



IF 




H E ALSO noted with surprise 
that the Jann was gone. The 
booth was empty and there was no 
familiar glint of robot metal. But 
he was sure the huge creature was 
in the vicinity — and would be for 
the next forty-nine-plus years. 

All he said was: “Please take a 
full set of X-rays on this patient.” 
Miss Thousandlegs rippled over, 
elevated her forepart and posi- 
tioned machine and plates. She 
was good at it, he had to admit, 
considering that she had probably 
only had experience with such 
equipment in some class on An- 
tique Apparatus. In a moment she 
had the pictures. 

He almost gaped. “Root canal 
therapy on every tooth — ” 

“They were pretty far gone,” 
Horsefeathers admitted. 

They must have been. Root ca- 
nal therapy was only called for 
when the central nerve of the tooth 
became contaminated. Then this 
nerve had to be removed and silver 
or guttapercha or some galactic 
equivalent substituted, so that no 
further decay could occur. The 
process was an expensive one but 
it generally saved the tooth. The 
tooth was insensitive thereafter, of 
course — without its nerve it could 
not feel temperature, pressure or 
pain. 

“I see no evidence of decay,” 
Dillingham said, inspecting the X- 
rays carefully. 

“They .still hurt,” Horsefeathers 
said stoutly. 

EQUALS FOUR 



With no nerves at all, they hurt. 
Dillingham controlled a sigh, 
knowing the dentists of Hobgoblin 
were enjoying this hugely. 

“Do you wish me to check the 
occlusion?” Miss Thousandlegs 
inquired. 

Bless her! 

“By all means.” 

She brought a wax plate and 
had the patient bite down on it so 
that his teeth imprinted the ma- 
terial in a horseshoe pattern, 
above and below. She studied this. 

“Serious malocclusion, Doc- 
tor,” she announced. 

Dillingham could tell by the si- 
lence around him that the goblins 
had forgotten to make this test — 
just as he himself had almost for- 
gotten in his preoccupation with 
the impression he was making. 
Miss Thousandlegs had saved him. 
It was beginning to look as though 
he had found his assistant. 

“This will not hurt,” he told 
Horsefeathers as he prepared his 
rotary unit. “In fact, I will not 
have to use any anesthetic. I am 
merely going to grind down some 
of the surfaces a little. To adjust 
the occlusion, so that your teeth 
will meet properly when you bite.” 

“But it doesn’t hurt where I 
bite! It hurts deep inside!” 

“This is typical,” Dillingham 
assured him. “You see, when the 
occlusion is imperfect — when your 
teeth meet unevenly — unatural 
stress is placed on certain sections 
of the jaw. While this effect is too 



59 




small for you to notice ordinarily, 
it continues to irritate the peridon- 
tal membrane — the lining sur- 
rounding the roots of your teeth — 
crushing and bruising it. This lin- 
ing is tough, for it is there to cush- 
ion the impact of constant chew- 
ing — but under abnormal stress it 
eventually becomes inflamed. And 
then you hurt— deep inside.” 
Horsefeathers gazed at him in 
wonder. “I never knew that.” 
“Perhaps your dentist did not 
feel this was necessary for you to 
know,” Dillingham said gently. 
“Many patients are not interested 
in such technical details.” 

Until they hurt, he thought wry- 

ly- 

The silence of the hall as he 
worked suggested that his point 
had been made. It was always best 
to let the patient know as much as 
feasible about his condition. An 
ignorant patient could be a diffi- 
cult one. Horsefeathers had not 
been an idle complainer — he had 
really had pain, though the cause 
was subtle and slow to develop. 

He finished and flushed the pol- 
ished surfaces. 

“Expectorate, please.” 

“Huh?” 

“Spit.” The translator was be- 
ing too literal, rendering a com- 
plex word in English into a com- 
plex equivalent in Clovenhoofian. 
He would have to tone down his 
language. 

“It will be a while before the in- 
flammation subsides,” he warned 

60 



Horsefeathers. “But there should 
be a steady improvement now — 
until you feel no pain at all.” 

The patient looked dubious. 

“It’ll still hurt?” 

“The membrane has to heal. 
When you break a leg you don’t 
expect it to be good as new the 
moment the vet sets it, do you?” 

Horsefeathers thought about 
that. He looked at his leg. He 
smiled. 

“Thank you, thank you, Doc- 
tor,” he said at last. “I’m so glad 
you came here.” He trotted off, 
limping a little before remember- 
ing that it was his mouth that 
hurt. 

A nother patient mounted the 
stage. This was a native Hob- 
goblin. Dillingham knew that 
meant trouble. He had counted his 
dental chickens too soon. 

“May I have your name, sir?” 
Miss Thousandlegs inquired. 

“Go fly a kite.” 

True to form, Dillingham 
thought. 

“How do you spell that, 
please?” 

Dillingham liked her better all 
the time. Spelling via translator 
was devious and suspect but she 
had fielded the insult nicely. 

“G-O,” the goblin spelled. “F- 
L-Y. The A is an initial for Al- 
gernon. Last name is K-l-T-E.” 
Dillingham reminded himself 
not to jump to conclusions. 

“And what is your problem?” 

IF 




Miss Thousandlegs inquired. 

“This tooth — it squishes. Some- 
times.” 

“May I look at it?” 

“You’re not the dentist, bug- 
face.” 

“Nevertheless, I may be able to 
narrow down the possibilities and 
save both you and Dr. Dillingham 
trouble.” 

Grudgingly he let her look. 

“Another restoration,” she 
murmured. “Tooth appears to be 
healthy.” 

“It’s not healthy, stupid. It 
squishes. Sometimes.” 

“Could you show me?” 

G.F.A. Kite bit down, almost 
nipping several of her hair-fine 
legs. 

“Nope. It’s not squishing right 
now. But it does. Sometimes.” 

“I’ll take an X-ray,” she said. 

She did. 

“When do I see the damn den- 
tist?” 

“In just a moment. Let me 
check your occlusion first.” She 
checked. “You may see him 
now.” 

She accompanied the patient to 
Dillingham’s operatory. 

“X-ray shows' nothing but the 
tooth is mobile,” she said. “The 
occlusion is slightly off.” 

Kite made a face. “I heard that 
about Horsefeathers. But mine is 
only one tooth and it doesn’t hurt, 
it squishes. Sometimes.” 

“Nevertheless, occlusion seems 

EQUALS FOUR 



the likely culprit,” Miss Thou- 
sandlegs said. “Two plus two 
equals four.” 

Dillingham agreed with her but 
felt she was going too far. She was 
not merely getting the facts — she 
was diagnosing and advising the 
patient, normally the dentist’s pre- 
rogative. 

He checked the tdbth. They were 
similar to human dentures and 
most had been restored metallical- 
ly. All were solid, including the 
squisher, except for that trace mo- 
bility his assistant had noted. He 
inspected the X-ray photograph. 
She was correct there too: the on- 
ly shadows in the picture con- 
formed to the restorative work 
present. It had to be the occlusion 
again. 

He made the necessary adjust- 
ments. But one thing nagged him 
— the occlusion was only margin- 
ally skew. Presuming that this 
condition had developed only re- 
cently, the described symptom was 
too sharp, too localized. 

Two plus two might equal four 
— but so did one plus three. And 
the goblin audience was suspi- 
ciously silent. 

He took the probe and checked 
around the tooth again. It re- 
mained firm and the gum line was 
stable. He looked at the X-ray 
once more. The metal of the res- 
toration shadowed it, one projec- 
tion extending along the distal sur- 
face adjacent to the next tooth. 
No trouble there. 

61 




Two plus two . 

Interesting coincidence that the 
Hobgoblin chief should send him 
two occlusion problems in a row. 
He would have expected some- 
thing more devious. 

H E POKED the tip of the probe 
between the two teeth, veri- 
fying that the : metal of each res- 
toration touched there. The space 
was narrow; there was no way he 
could reach it except by forcing 
the wire point down, causing the 
patient momentary discomfort. 

Kite yelped. 

The probe broke through into 
something soft. 

“Equals four,” Dillingham said. 
He had found the trouble — a 
thin cavity just under the metal, 
concealed from direct view by its 
location and the overhanging res- 
toration. Its shadow in the X-ray 
was hidden by the configuration of 
metal itself. Truly an invisible de- 
terioration — that squished. Some- 
times. 

Miss Thousandlegs had almost 
led him astray by her too-ready 
diagnosis. Had he corrected the 
occlusion and sent the patient 
home the decay could have con- 
tinued for months. 

Two plus two did equal four. 
But that was not the whole truth 
— and the goblin dental chief must 
have known it — setting the Uni- 
versity representative up with a 
valid occlusion case first. Then the 
seeming occlusion — a trap. 



“Anesthetic,” Dillingham said. 

Miss Thousandlegs brought the 
loaded needle. He injected the 
flinching patient. It had been so 
long since he had used anything 
this primitive that he had forgot- 
ten to apply a surface anesthetic 
before giving the shot— and his as- 
sitant hadn’t reminded him. Not 
her fault. She simply was not fa- 
miliar with his procedures, his lit- 
tle lapses. 

He readied the drill. 

“Vacuum,” he said. 

Miss Thousandlegs applied the 
vacuum, sucking the saliva and 
moisture from the water-cooled 
drill. 

“Other side,” he murmured, as 
her instrument obstructed his 
view. He began cutting away the 
overhang of the tooth. 

He finished and removed the 
drill. 

“Mallet,” he said, picking up 
the chisel. 

She held it up but his hand 
missed contact. The mallet 
bounced off his fingers and fell to 
the floor. The goblins guffawed. 

Again — not her fault, he re- 
minded himself. She was not ad- 
justed to his movements. But the 
accident was embarrassing. 

He knocked off the metal 
crown, exposing the decay. He 
fished for the gold chunk before 
the patient could choke on it — and 
banged into one of his assistant’s 
insectlike arms. She had been 
reaching for it too.

IF 




Dillingham stopped. Miss Thou- 
sandlegs was competent and co- 
operative — but it just wasn’t 
working out. He could not oper- 
ate effectively with her. 

“M iss — ” he started. And 
blinked. Miss Thousandlegs was 
gone. She had been replaced by a 
humanoid biped. 

H E WAS tired of this long-dis- 
tance sleight-of-hand. Miss 
Tarantula might enjoy tugging on 
interplanetary thread and chang- 
ing his assistants in mid operation 
but he did not. 

“Vacuum,” he said abruptly, 
taking up the drill again. 

Assistant number four, the 
biped, applied the vacuum. Her 
arms terminated in quintuple, 
jointed digits that pinched together 
to hold the tube. He had seen more 
effective appendages for this work 
but at least she did not get in his 
way or obstruct his vision. 

He finished his excavation. 
“Hydrocolloid,” he snapped. 

She already had the metal form 
and cold water ready for the hy- 
drocolloid impression. He made 
the cast without difficulty and she 
took it away. He put a temporary 
covering over the tooth. 

“A new restoration will have to 
be made,” he told Kite. “I have 
prepared the tooth and taken an 
impression but it will be some 
time before the restoration is 
ready. Your local prosthodontists 
are perfectly capable of doing it 

EQUALS FOUR 



and I commend you to their ser- 
vices. You were quite correct 
about your problem and fortunate- 
ly we have diagnosed it in time to 
save the tooth.” 

“Doctor,” the new assistant 
said. 

“What?” He was tired, and 
there was something strange about 
the way she spoke. 

“Will you check the other re- 
storations now?” 

“The other — ” He paused. 
“You’re right. A good restoration 
does not go wrong without cause. 
I’ll have to have a look.” 

It was a dismal prospect but he 
could not risk the same kind of 
oversight the local dentists had 
made. 

He hammered off the adjacent 
cap. It came off easily — too easily. 
He scraped at the exposed cement. 

“Soft,” he muttered. “No won- 
der there was trouble.” 

The goblin chief was about to be 
snared in his own prosthodontic 
trap. 

The assistant took the gold cap 
and cleaned out the debris. Dilling- 
ham hammered at the next restor- 
ation. This one was stiffer but fi- 
nally came off. The binding cement 
was similarly soft. 

“Brother!” he muttered. “They 
must all be defective. The cement 
is deteriorating. Real trouble com- 
ing up.” 

“Now just a moment,” a voice 
objected. It was the chief dentist of

In mind-to-mind communication among 
men, honesty can be the worst policy! 



B EDFORD should have known could think of only one other per- 
better. But he had been work- son who would appreciate at once 
ing for so long away from the so- the significance of what he had ae- 
rial mainstream of the world that complished. His name was Ste- 
his sense of values had become phen Thorpe. He was a poet and — 
confused. And when he had con- in this devious and unquiet age — 
eluded his momentous work he and an old and trusted friend. 



65 





He could not bring himself to 
call upon a representative of a 
government he had long since 
ceased to believe in and he was 
loath to deal directly with the pop- 
ular press which had so maligned 
his activities over the last decade. 
But the desire to share his discov- 
ery with someone was overpower- 
ing. He had lived so long in his sol- 
itary tower waiting for this mo- 
ment and now that it had arrived 
it cried out for a witness. 

Perhaps one of the more toler- 
ant of his former colleagues might 
have condescended to visit him and 
— in his own time — watched him 
demonstrate his miraculous de- 
vice. But Bedford couldn’t wait — 
and besides, he wanted nothing 
more to do with them. Only an 
artist of Thorpe’s caliber could be 
allowed to experience this discov- 
ery before it was bestowed upon a 
weak and desperate world. So he 
hurried downstairs in a fever of 
excitment and telephoned his old 
friend. 

T HORPE was tired. He had 
only just returned from a 
strenuous northern tour, a success- 
ful and highly lucrative excursion 
which had culminated that after- 
noon with an exhausting open-air 
recital. Now, more than anything 
else, he desired peace and a little 
quiet and time to prepare himself 
for the ordeal of his homecoming. 
His publicity department had ar- 
ranged a wild party for later that 



evening and he was not looking 
forward to it. He loathed the sim- 
pering affectations of the people 
who considered themselves his 
peers. 

He was surprised and intrigued 
to hear from Bedford. Arthur 
Bedford had slipped from his 
thoughts, along with many other 
embarrassing memories which 
would have been out of place in 
the mind of Earth’s leading poet 
and thinker. Success had a way of 
gobbling up old friendships. 

He was momentarily irritated 
with Bedford’s use of his old name 
but made no comment. The tele- 
phone Bedford was using was old- 
fashioned and apparently lacked 
video circuits — Thorpe stared at 
the blank screen and found himself 
curious about how Bedford looked 
these days. Tqo, he had hoped to 
escape at least some of the dreary 
party ahead of him. 

Bedford wanted to see him now 
— this evening. This instant. 
Please, Stephen, for old time’s 
sake . I owe it to you . Thorpe 
actually smiled at that. What can 
we possibly owe each other? 

But he could not ignore the ur- 
gent supplication in Bedford’s 
voice. He loved to feel needed and 
success seemed to have abstracted 
his relationships with other people 
to such ah extent that he some- 
times longed for the deeper attach- 
ments of another time. 

“All right, Arthur,’’ he said. 
“I’ll be right over.’’

IF 




He dressed quickly. With his 
mind on the forthcoming party — 
he would see Bedford first — he 
chose a black velvet evening suit 
and matching cape — the one with 
the breathtaking emerald-green 
lining. His accessories were a 
loose white shirt with a magnifi- 
cent ( ruffle around the neck, 
pointed black shoes and a wide- 
brimmed black felt hat. 

Satisfied with his appearence, he 
selected an elegant swagger-stick 
from his ornate collection and 
sauntered quietly off into the 
night, leaving his twin Jaguars 
caged and delighting in the anony- 
mity ofhis nocturnal venture. 

The cane was important. More 
than a complement to the rest of 
his attire, it was also an extremely 
useful defense mechanism: a built- 
in powerpack delivered quite a jolt 
of electricity to the jeweled tip. It 
had served on numerous occasions 
to fend off the unwanted attentions 
of overenthusiastic admirers — and 
enemies. Public idols in this god- 
less age were often subject to bad 
treatment and the law permitted 
him to carry discreet discourage- 
ment with him wherever he went. 
And it was comforting to realize 
one had such a stylish defense. 

The address Bedford had given 
him was only a few miles from his 
hotel, in one of the older and less 
fashionable areas of the diseased 
city. He found his way without dif- 
ficulty but as he moved deeper into 
the slums he began to feel some 



qualms — perhaps even a small 
measure of guilt. And when he fi- 
nally stopped outside the gaunt 
and decrepit tenement his old 
friendModged in he felt a twinge of 
regret. 

The building could not be very 
far short off being condemned. Ar- 
thur Bedford must have fallen just 
about as far as anyone could pos- 
sibly fall in the false economic 
structure of his time. Thorpe 
leaned forward and pressed the 
jeweled tip of his cane against an 
archaic electrical buzzer located 
on one side of the door. He kept 
his weight against it for some 
time, until he could identify the 
weak signal he had generated mov- 
ing fitfully through the great 
house. Then he stepped back to 
wait. 

He studied his reflection in the 
grimy glass panel of the door. He 
looked younger than his forty- 
seven years. As a youth he had 
been blessed with the noble, aesthe- 
tic features of his calling and the 
soft passage of years and the sim- 
ple demands of his sedentary oc- 
cupation had allowed only a pouch 
or two of excessive flesh to mar 
his well-publicized and handsome 
face — and even these unwanted 
medals of middle-age provided him 
with the semblance of maturity 
and wisdom necessary to his por- 
trait as the Poet^ Laureate of 
swinging Britain. 

He waited for what seemed an 
inordinate amount of time before 



THE COMMUNICATION MACHINE 



67 




he detected distant scuffling 
sounds from somewhere inside the 
building; sounds that suggested 
the passage of some weary body 
down an ancient, creaking stair- 
case. 

God — this entire area should 
have been razed a decade ago . 

A WEAK light came on inside 
and cast a wan glow through 
the dirty glass panel, erasing 
Thorpe’s image. The door swung 
open and the guarded face of Ar- 
thur Bedford peered out. 

For a moment Thorpe was 
caught off his cultivated guard. He 
hadn’t expected the years to have 
extracted sucfi a cruel toll from 
his old friend. Bedford’s features 
had always tended towards heavi- 
ness — now they had become al- 
most obese. Swollen bags of flesh 
hung under each watery eye and a 
lower lip so full and cracked that 
it projected out like some creak- 
ing verandah over his several chins 
was the next most prominent fea- 
ture. Several weeks’ untidy stubble 
stood out from Bedford’s pale 
flesh and a few scraps of hair were 
carelessly smeared over his scalp. 
Deep lines of fatigue — and despair 
—had been etched into this miser- 
able face and, for some reason he 
could not fathom, Thorpe felt — 
for a moment — wretchedly awk- 
ward and unwise. 

Bedford stared, blinking away 
the years in the half-light. 

He said, “Stephen — ’’ 

The word hung over a slience 



and carried a wealth of meaning. 
But to Thorpe, poet, it was sud- 
denly the currency of a distant 
time and another age — it disturbed 
him to remember some things. 

“I’m so glad so glad you could 
come.’’ Bedford was almost shak- 
ing. They looked at each other. 
And there should have been time 
for their meeting to become 
inbued with some sense of occa- 
sion — time for them to have re- 
mained in a trance-like state while 
they studied the many changes 
which time had rung down upon 
them — but Bedford’s private de- 
mon drove him on hurriedly. 
“Come in. Come in — ’’ 

He opened the door wide and 
Thorpe stepped inside. 

The place stank. A musty amal- 
gam of old papers, discarded food 
containers and unwashed flesh. 
Thorpe’s educated nose twitched 
with disgust. 

“This way.’’ 

He followed Bedford up the 
creaking staircase. 

Was that shambling figure 
ahead of him really Arthur Bed- 
ford? That creature hinged for- 
ward from the waist in an arthritic 
stoop? Could time — and a hostile 
society — really do this to a man? 
And how unkind of life to remind 
him they were contemporaries. 
Perhaps, after all, he should have 
stayed at his hotel and rested up 
for a while — and then gone to his 
reception — instead of coming here; 
he wasn’t in the proper mood for 
old-fashioned reminiscences. Still, 



68 



IF 




he had come. He was here. Some 
common courtesy was called for. 

Bedford paused on the landing. 
He looked around at his visitor 
and gestured vaguely towards the 
open door in front of them. His 
expression was apologetic. 

“It’s been — been a long time,’’ 
he wheezed. The climb upstairs 
had all but exhausted him. “But 
it’s good to see you again, Ste- 
phen.’’ 

His thoughtless use of Thorpe’s 
discarded given name again upset 
the poet. He had chosen his new 
name with great care and it an- 
noyed him to have it sullied by any 
perfunctory reference to its unin- 
spired predecessor. 

But his anger quickly cooled. 
He was reminded that there had 
once been a life for them together, 
long before Virgil Thorpe had be- 
gun to impress a fickle and foolish 
public. 

Bedford was a scientist — a rea- 
sonable grasp of the arts had al- 
ways eluded him. He was groping 
and inarticulate — he looked for 
truth deep in the abstract realms 
of physics and mathematics and 
considered art a preoccupation of 
the emotionally self-indulgent. 

That had been the essence of 
their ultimate incompatability, the 
reason behind their final disillu- 
sionment with each other. They 
had each sought the same goal — 
but from different viewpoints — and 
in the painful process of remem- 
bering some of these things his 
wrath was curbed and he found he 



could distill a small measure of 
charity toward this frail, lonely 
creature he had once called friend 
— and more. 

“Yes,” he agreed, “it has been a 
long time.” 

He followed Bedford into the 
brightly lit room. 

I T WAS more like the main 
room of a warehouse than a 
place where a man could retreat 
from the rigors of an unfriendly 
society. Benches were piled high 
with a bewildering variety of elec- 
tronic apparatus — the floor be- 
tween was a refuse heap of dis- 
carded hardboard boxes and a con- 
fused tangle of varicolored wire 
weeds. A battered armchair had 
been pushed into a far corner of 
the room by all this activity — there 
it faced the dead vacant mouth of 
a fuel fire and a 'tattered accumu- 
lation of books and magazines, 
piled high into ricketty wooden 
shelving already pulled out of 
shape by its burden. The air stank 
of solder and shorted electrical 
connections. 

It was a hostile environment. 
Science had always baffled Thorpe. 
He had a totally intuitive mind and 
had never mastered the complex- 
ities and the subtleties of scientific 
thought — he had been a poor schol- 
ar but an ambitious soul, so per- 
haps it was inevitable that he 
should have gravitated toward the 
arts while Bedford pursued his pri- 
vate internal vision. 

The poet could only marvel at 

69 



THE COMMUNICATION MACHINE 




the meaning of so much technolog- 
ical bric-a-brac. Of course, Bed- 
ford had always been an inveterate 
tinkerer and had assured himself 
of a steady income years earlier 
when he had evolved a number of 
very clever patents. Obviously he 
had continued some side research 
— and along the way he might even 
have picked up one or two gullible 
aristocrats willing to finance his 
schemes. Admittedly, his press had 
been disastrous in recent years but 
there were probably still enough 
simple-minded sponsors of rat- 
baggery left in the world to provide 
Bedford with a small measure of 
monetary assistance. He had al- 
ways been devious at getting what 
he wanted, Thorpe mused, and it 
was obvious that this was one gift 
he had not yet frittered away. 

Otherwise I wouldn’t be here 
now . 

The public was a malleable mon- 
ster shaped by taste and style. It 
had elevated Virgil Thorpe from 
obscurity and made him the most 
fashionable figure of his age: a 
performing poet. And while he had 
come so close to godhood Bedford 
had been driven — by the very na- 
ture of his obsessions and the 
questionable areas of his investiga- 
tions — into becoming a recluse. 
Organized science had ostracized 
him — the public lionized Thorpe. 
It was a strange balance — and the 
deficit seemed to belong to the 
prematurely aged scientist. 

Bedford kicked aside the re- 
mains of several packages and ges- 
70 



tured toward the tattered armchair 
in the corner. 

“Sit down, Stephen, sit down” 
The poet did as he was bidden, his 
lip curling a little in disgust when 
he noticed the deep layer of dust 
on the furniture. “I — I’ll get you 
something to drink.” 

Bedford struggled with the slid- 
ing doors of a shelf cupboard. His 
hands were as inarticulate and 
fumbling as his clumsy speech with 
its unfinished sentences and weari- 
some pauses. Thorpe took off his 
luxurious cape and folded it care- 
fully before placing it over the 
back of the chair. He sat leaning 
slightly forward so as not to crease 
it. His eyes followed Bedford’s 
movements with wry amusement. 

“Would you — would you fancy 
a little port?” The look of guilt 
and self-reproach in the scientist’s 
face was a sure indication that he 
had nothing fclse to offer. 

Thorpe nodded graciously and 
accepted the small tumbler and the 
dark, almost viscous fluid it con- 
tained. 

Bedford’s hands were shaking. 
There was a wild look of enthusi- 
asm in his eyes the poet found dif- 
ficult to correlate with the other, 
older image he carried in his mind. 

“You can’t imagine,” Bedford 
went on, “you can’t really under- 
stand how — how very good it is to 
see you again, Stephen.” 

Thorpe winced at the repetition 
of his old name. The touch of their 
fingers — for one brief moment 
when he had taken the glass of 

IF 




port — had reminded him of some- 
thing they had once thought per- 
manent but which had sundered 
like everything else in the un- 
wanted past. 

His own hands were well cared 
for. His skin was pale but it was 
cleansed regularly with the proper 
oils. His nails were well shaped and 
polished to perfection by the best 
man in London. Bedford’s hands 
were repugnant — they were old and 
ugly, the fingers cracked and un- 
washed and disgusting dark sedi- 
ment was buried underneath the 
broken nails. It galled Thorpe to 
recall that he had once found those 
same hands attractive. 



B EDFORD downed his drink in 
a single long gulp. He licked 
his lips appreciatively. 

“Damn fine wine.’’ 

Thorpe made no comment. The 
wine was foul. He took a long sip, 
intending to despatch the noxious 
potion as quickly as possible and 
to forget the flavor. He coughed 
and mopped his pencil-thin mous- 
tache with an initialed green silk 
handkerchief. 

“You said something on the 
phone,” he tactfully reminded, 
“about some marvelous machine 
you’ve been working on.” 

Bedford gave him a curious 
look. “A machine, did you say? 
Well, I suppose it is — partly. But 
to describe it properly .... yes, I 
have made an apparatus — and it is 
true that it has certain, ah, me- 



chanical parts. But that, my dear 
Stephen, is only the beginning.” 
“Where is it, then?” Thorpe 
asked. 

“Ah, you must be patient — pa- 
tient.” 

Bedford seemed to have per- 
formed some miraculous feat of 
physical regeneration — he now 

stood straighter. His hands clasped 
behind his back, and his eyes were 
focused dead ahead upon some' 
private infinity. Thorpe was his 
audience and he was oblivious to 
everything other than the revela- 
tion he had prepared. 

“To think,” he went on, “after 
all these years — ” He uncoupled 
his hands and described some awk- 
ward, ambiguous diagram in the 
air. Thorpe supposed it was a ges- 
ture meant to indicate the diffi- 
culties of his guest but made no 
comment. He put his glass aside. 
The port really was undrinkable. 

“After all these year,” Bedford 
repeated. “But now it is done. 
Finished. And the world will never 
be the same. Stephen, I will tell 
you what I have here. I have a — 
call it a machine, if you must — but 
a machine that will revolutionize 
communications.” 

The poet sniffed his impatience. 
“I thought we had enough of those 
gadgets already. Radios, videos, 
telephones, masers, lasers and — ” 
“No, no, no. Nothing like that. 
Not like that — at all. Something 
vastly different.” 

“Then for God’s sake what is 

71 



THE COMMUNICATION MACHINE 




it?” Thorpe snapped irritably. 

“Stephen, be patient. Think — 
think a little. All our disturbances, 
all of our wars and our intoler- 
ances — they spring from one 
source: our inability to understand 
each other. We each live out our 
lives as prisoners in solitary tow- 
ers, communicating with each oth- 
er with signs that never — somehow 
— manage to mean the same thing 
to any of us. How can we ever 
hope— expect — to accept another 
person’s point of view, to compre- 
hend matters alien to our own way 
of thinking when we are bound- 
bound, Stephen — by the awful 
tyranny of words?” 

A sudden finger lunged in the 
poet’s direction. “You. You’ve 
been— very successful, haven’t 
you? Poetry. Poetry is — or was — a 
communication with an intellectu- 
al elite. But it wasn’t they who 
made this world what it is— that 
was left to the mindless jargon of 
pqliticians and power fetishists. 
And you, Stephen — you and your 
kind have reduced your art to the 
level of mass entertainment. You 
are no longer communicating on 
that level — that level to which you 
once — aspired. You have become 
— a performer. And a very popular 
one, no doubt. But as a communi- 
cator you were finished years ago. 
Once they got their claws into you, 
elevated you, lionized you and 
made you what you are. But do 
they ever really listen, Stephen, 
and if they ever did — would they 

72 



hear anything? Not that it matters 
any more, of course. My machine 
will make your words as obsolete 
as last year’s poem. I will bring an 
end to this intolerable confusion of 
mind and purpose which words 
have created and — and crippled 
our intellectual promise. I will 
bring down Babel and restore man 
to himself! I will bring about a 
new millennium! 



T HE poet was shaking with an- 
ger. The megalomaniacal qual- 
ity that had saturated the terminal 
portion of Bedford’s tirade was 
distressing. He had listened with 
growing impatience while his ex- 
friend had hurled insults at his 
craft and his calling and he was not 
prepared to accept much more. 
The fool had gone too far. Was it 
for this that he had been called — 
to suffer humiliation and let his 
emotions be toyed with? 

“Look here, Arthur — ” 

When Bedford saw he was pre- 
pared to rise out of his chair he 
tempered his galloping enthusiasm 
and motioned the poet to remain 
seated. 

“Oh, I’m sorry, Stephen, if I’ve 
offended you. But think — think 
what all this will mean — what to- 
tal communication will mean. No 
more misunderstanding. Mind will 
comprehend mind without having 
to pass through the clumsy medi- 
um of words. We will have — we 
will have global peace at last! Oh, 

IF 




there’s so much to work out, so 
much to consider — ” 

“You could begin by showing 
me this thing,” Thorpe suggested, 
his anger tempered to a reasonable 
pique. “What is it?” 

Bedford brightened and moved 
forward toward the cluttered bench 
nearest the chair. 

“Come over here. I’ll show 
you.” 

Feeling a trifle foolish, Thorpe 
stood up and followed him across 
the room. 

Bedford gestured proudly at a 
cumbersome gadget that looked 
no different, to the poet’s un- 
trained eye, from any other piece 
in the overcrowded room. 

“There it is,” he said. “The pre- 
cursor of the new millennium for 
mankind.” 

It was roughly the size and 
shape of a radio transmitter. The 
array of dials and meters meant 
nothing to Thorpe. The circular 
window in the center could be lik- 
ened to a small video tube or the 
face of an oscilloscope screen, de- 
pending on your information. 
There was space along the bottom 
of the machine for all sorts of 
plug-in connections and what 
looked like two sets of compli- 
cated headphones housed in cum- 
bersome headpieces, like the top 
section of a lunarsuit. 

“Is that all?” he asked. The 
whole box and tricks could have 
been Fitted into a four-by-three 
container without any difficulty. 



Bedford laughed. The sound was 
a short, almost hysterical squeak. 

“Well, what did you expect?” 
He leaned forward and threw a 
couple of switches eagerly. The 
machine hummed. “We’ll see how 
it works, eh? I suppose you’re 
wondering why I haven’t called in 
the press? Well, I didn’t want to. 
Tell me, Stephen — do you find it 
strange that after — after all these 
years I should remember you? 
And how we felt so strongly about 
the lack of proper communication 
in the world? Well, I wanted you 
to be here tonight to witness what 
I have done. To be — to be the first 
person to witness the enormity of 
what I have achieved — to have you 
understand.” 

Of course this could not be 
strictly true, Thorpe thought cyn- 
ically. Bedford* would have tried 
out his machine — probably to have 
seen his subjects run terrified from 
the house. It was unlikely that he 
would have had access to sophisti- 
cated test subjects under his pre- 
sent living conditions. 

Bedford tapped the machine af- 
fectionately. “Of course, this is 
only a prototype. Actual produc- 
tion models will be much smaller. 
People will have to wear them, you 
see, and — perhaps I’d better ex- 
plain some of the theory behind all 
this before I demonstrate?” 

“Please,” Thorpe insisted, 
“spare me the details. I have to at- 
tend a function in a short while. If 
you want to show me how this 



THE COMMUNICATION MACHINE 



73 




thing works — for God’s sake get 
it going. I can’t hang around here 
all night” 

A NY calculated cruelty in these 
words was lost on the scientist. 
“Forgive me. I had forgotten 
your impatience with figures. Here 
— let me show you — ” He picked 
up one of the head-pieces and 
rested it carefully over his scalp. 
He made a few minor seating ad- 
justments and tested one or two 
connections, he smiled. “You see? 
Quite comfortable.” He gestured 
to Thorpe to put on the compan- 
ion unit. “You’ll get used to it 
very quickly.” 

Gingerly the poet settled the 
complex headpiece over his head. 
Bedford came closer and made the 
necessary adjustments and then 
stepped back. 

“There. Now — now to begin. I 
think perhaps — perhaps we had 
better both sit down.” 

The cables connecting them to 
the machine on the bench were 
long enough to permit Thorpe to 
return to his chair, and for Bed- 
ford to perch himself on an up- 
turned wooden packing case. A 
distance of roughly nine feet sep- 
erated them from each other and 
from the machine. 

Bedford gestured to the small 
black control, box spliced into the 
cables and resting in his lap. “I’ll 
tell you a bit more about that in a 
minute,” he said. “But first, a lit- 
tle explanation of what to expect. 



You could call it — and they prob- 
ably will — ‘assisted telepathic con- 
tact.’ A.T.C. — now that’s a good 
one for the press to boot around*, 
isn’t it? Well, why should I care? 
They won’t be in business much 
longer.” 

“Assisted what?” 

“Now don’t get excited.” The 
scientist waved a solicitous hand. 
“And don’t go jumping into any of 
the popular misconceptions. Tele- 
pathy, as such has always been a 
fiction. The human mind just isn’t 
powerful enough to broadcast and 
receive messages over a distance. 
But that it does broadcast has been 
established: all my little machine 
does is boost this infinitesimal cur- 
rent so that it will bridge the awe- 
some distance between one mind 
and another. Just how far will have 
to be established with further ex- 
perimentation. This is only the be- 
ginning, Stephen.” 

The poet continued to regard 
the set-up dubiously. He scarcely 
knew what to think. Either Bed- 
ford was crazy or he had discov- 
ered some vital new principle and 
if he had . 

“Get on with it,” he snapped, 
his irritation beginning to get the 
better of his polished courtesy. 
“I’m still waiting to see what you 
have.” 

“Precisely.” Bedford tested the 
volume control and nodded happi- 
ly. His eyes became a triumphant. 
“I wanted you here, Stephen, to 
witness the death of words — ” 



74 



IF 




The circular screen Thorpe had 
likened to an oscilloscope came 
alive with dancing green patterns. 
They were beautiful. The theory of 
science might have baffled him but 
the visible and end products some- 
times awed him — and such was the 
case as he stared at these enigmat- 
ic wiggles. 

“You are observing my 
thoughts,” Bedford pointed out. 
“Not the electrical rhythm of my 
brain, you understand, but the ac- 
tual message of my thoughts.” 

But the poet could only stare 
and wonder. Was he being conned 
or genuinely mystified? 

“If you want to know what I’m 
thinking, Stephen, you only have 
to bring your mind into rapport 
with mine. To do this you will 
need to adjust that red volume con- 
trol very carefully, otherwise .the 
full power of telepathic contact, 
might prove overwhelming. Ad- 
vance it slowly.’’ 

Thorpe hesitated. He looked 
down at the volume control nest- 
ling against his left arm. He took 
a deep breath, moved his other 
hand across and advanced the red 
knob a judicious notch. 

Nothing happened. 

Bedford was studying him keen- 
ly. He motioned with his head to 
continue advancing the volume. 

Thorpe moved it a notch higher. 

And another. 

A T FIRST he was only con- 
scious of a faint susurrus of 



sound in his mind that might have 
been some small residue of back- 
ground noise from the machine it- 
self. And then he realized that it 
was less a sound than something 
else. 

His scalp prickled. A nervous 
tic he had forgotten years before 
invaded his left cheek, making it 
dance uncomfortably just below 
his eye. There was a strangeness 
about this rapport with a machine 
he found disturbing but curiosity 
— and Bedford’s earnest insistence 
— forced him to follow through. 

A notch higher and there was 
still no perceptible difference. Was 
Bedford playing him for a fool? 

Angrily he twisted the dial an 
incautious three stages further. 

And found it. 

The rustling mental static 
cleared. His mind was illuminated 
as if by a searchlight. He became 
filled with rapture. Someone — it 
had to be Bedford — was smiling at 
him from over a vast distance. 

There could be no question 
about it: he had made contact with 
another mind. He had no reason 
to doubt — every atom of his body 
agreed— and at his fingertips was 
the means of intensifying this in- 
credible rapport. 

What was it, really? 

Bedford’s mind? 

Soul? 

Spirit? 

Definitely something unique — 
the seat of personality and identity. 
For the first time in his life the 



THE COMMUNICATION MACHINE 



75 




poet was conscious of what it was 
like to have somebody else’s 
thoughts creeping through his 
mind and he grew hungry for a 
fuller experience. 

Threshold was not enough. He 
passed beyond this meeting place 
of pure thought — where atoms 
rustled soundlessly together and 
the human mind began — and ad- 
vanced the volume control as far 
as it would go. 

The impact was tremendous. He 
was engulfed in a psychic flood, 
and when it cleared he found him- 
self possessed of a serenity which 
had eluded him through all of his 
previous adult life. 

Bedford had not been lying. His 
machine really did work. From 
now on it would be possible for 
each human mind to communicate 
directly with another — the race 
would be absolved of the drudgery 
of words and all the mendacity 
that had accompanied oral com- 
munication. And Arthur Bedford 
had made all this possible. 

Thorpe had thought — long ago 
— that he had known Bedford bet- 
ter than anyone else and perhaps 
he had. But now he could see how 
grossly mistaken he had been, that 
it was impossible — or rather, had 
been impossible — for anyone real- 
ly to know another. Now he un- 
derstood Bedford’s passion for en- 
lightenment — out of his loneliness 
and his desperation at the loss of 
their friendship which he, Virgil 
Thorpe, had engineered, had come 



something as meaningful as this. 

The shame of his callous dis- 
posal of their friendship sickened 
him. But he felt the scientist’s 
compassion engulf him and soothe 
away the jagged teeth of his guilt. 

It is over. It is past. Let us for - 
get and see what the future holds. 

Their minds locked, embraced 
and they looked out. Thorpe’s 
mind had been quiescent and dumb 
underneath the great tide of Bed- 
ford’s accomplishment — now it 
soared and was united, was one 
and equal — it reached out and 
marveled at this annexation of 
souls and they looked forward with 
one identity at what the future held. 

They saw a world stripped of the 
crutch of language. They saw a 
world where universal understand- 
ing was the accepted norm and 
where lies had been driven out and 
peace reigned forever, where evil 
had ceased to exist because no 
mind could harbor it. They saw 
the human race linked together as 
one great intellect. They saw an 
end to wars, to grubby competi- 
tion and all the psychological ills 
which had crippled mankind. 

This was Arthur Bedford’s vi- 
sion. And it seemed too good to 
be true. If everyone understood 
everyone else Earth would be a 
paradise. 

But wait a moment. 

What is this dark beast I see? 

It asked a question. 

If individual motives, desires 

IF

and ambitions were understood, 
then . 

What motives? 

What desires? 

What ambitions? 

The vision did not seem so beau- 
tiful now. Thorpe’s mind projected 
its own visions — the artist’s strug- 
gle for his soul, his individuality 
apart from the mass mind. 

You cannot take this from us — 
there is not one of us who is not in 
some small way a child of art . As 
murderers we became men and as 
artists the abiding conscience of 
mankind. You cannot allow this 
to happen, Arthur. Don't you un- 
derstand . 

But of course he did — under- 
standing was what the machine 
was for. With an abruptness that 
was almost surgical in its shock 
the rapport was cut off. 

For a while a dark sludge shil . 
uneasily around in Thorpe’s dulled 
mind, waiting for words to give 
terrible weight to his fear when he 
found time to speak. 

T HEY looked at each other 
through. Bedford’s hands and 
face were soaked with sweat. 
Thorpe’s left cheek twitched crazi- 
ly. He levered the headpiece away 
and struggled to his feet. Bedford 
raised his palsied hands and pushed 
his own headpiece aside but he did 
not get up. He remained crouched 
on the packing case as if he had 
been struck down by something 
too big to grasp. 



“Arthur — you must destroy this 
thing,’’ Thorpe said. There was no 
demand in his words, only a simple 
statement of fact. “And your pa- 
pers — everything connected with 
this foul thing. Now — at once — 
before either of us have time to 
think. It’s too monstrous to let — ’’ 

Bedford raised his head. His 'an- 
cient cheeks were wet now with 
tears and his face looked ashen. 

“Destroy it? How can you say 
such a thing? The years — the work 
— the pain — ’’ 

He seemed to have left his mind 
somewhere where it was still being 
attacked by the awful monsters the 
poet had dreamed up. 

What motives? 

What desires? 

What ambitions? 

“Stephen — I can’t. Not this. It’s 
>n my life’s work. I can’t 
w .„ for nothing — for less than 
nothing. Think of what it will 
mean to the world — an end to all 
the disasters that have plagued us 
since the beginning of time. A fresh 
chance. A new beginning — without 
lies — without wars — with hope, 
Stephen — hope!’’ 

“But it will mean an end to ev- 
erything — can’t you see that? To 
art, to literature, to music, to 
drama, to all the heirs of art! All 
the things that have made us some- 
thing more than animals, the 
things that have made us great. An 
end to all individual aspiration — 
can’t you see that, too?’’ 



THE COMMUNICATION MACHINE 



77 




But Bedford could not. 

The communication machine sat 
between them, motionless and un- 
moved, watching this little drama, 
unwanted now and the very sum of 
all the inconsistencies of the world 
wrapped up in one miraculous 
piece of engineering. 

“Then you would have us suf- 
fer?” Bedford asked quietly, as 
though his mind were already 
made up. “Suffer all of the things 
I can dispell?”' 

“Yes — don’t you see, it’s our 
only salvation?” 

Thorpe was shouting now. “We 
must destroy your machine to save 
the soul of mankind — ” 

“Are you sure, Stephen? Or just 
for the protection of your own 
fragile ego? 

“You’re mad, Arthur. You 
must be. Some day we will 
ourselves, Arthur. We will 
race of the things you 
but that will be when he have at- 
tained an emotional and intellectu- 
al maturity necessary for the sort 
of society you hold ideal, not be- 
cause some clever little machine 
has made it possible to accommo- 
date our minds as they are now — 
feeble and primitive and not even 
half formed.” 

Bedford rose. A look of grim 
determination had come over him. 

“No, Stephen. My machine 
will liberate us now — while there 
is still time.” 

“No. It will debase man. Not 
all minds are equal — you must

know that — and your machine has 
the potential to dilute individual 
intelligence down to a common 
and unimaginative norm. You’re 
blind, Arthur. But more than that 
—you’re a fool, a fool actually 
to think you have done something 
worthwhile.” 

Bedford stood mute, like some 
terrible statue, his face drained of 
all life. His silence incensed 
Thorpe. The poet screamed some- 
thing incoherent, pushed past him 
and grappled with the communica- 
tion machine. With one great 
heave he pushed it off the bench 
and it crashed loudly to the floor. 

The case shattered easily. It was 
only a jury-rigged test model and 
its insides broke up under the rain 
of smaller instruments that Thorpe 
brought down on it with maniacal 
Yenzy. 

ie stamped on the headpieces 
and hammered and ground them 
under his heel. He screamed abuse 
at Bedford, at science, at God and 
at everything else he had learned 
to hate. 

B EDFORD snapped out of his 
trance. 

“No, no! Stop that — stop — ” 
Thorpe paid no attention but 
went on with his destructive orgy. 
He had to kill it,, eradicate it, de- 
stroyitdestroyitdestroyit . 

Don’t, Stephen, please — don’t 
do it — ” 

The statue moved and suppli-

IF 




This may be the strangest 
father-daughter love story . 



1 WAS hardly in the house when 
the electric dishwasher grabbed 
me. It shot up its lid and tried to 
submerge my head in hot, soapy 
water. Twisting, I kneed its smooth 
desert-colored front surface and 
managed to yank its cord free of 




the kitchen wall plug. The ma- 
chine kept working, pumping scald- 
ing water at me, clutching at my 
shoulders with some kind of wiry 
tentacles. I grunted, snapped its 
arms off me for a second. I spun 
the heavy machine away from me. 
I dodged it, hopping across the af- 
ternoon-bright parquet of the 
kitchen. 

The dishwasher came rolling af- 
ter me, tentacles outstretched. I 
grabbed up a blowmold kitchen 
stool and thrust it at the machine’s 
running wheels. The dishwasher 
tripped, fell over on its side and 
splashed sudsy water all around. I 
ran for the sundeck, my right hand 
reaching up under my jacket to- 
ward my holster. 

Upright again, the dishwasher 
was rolling my way on its little 
wheels. Behind me was the Pacific 
Ocean, about three hundred feet 
straight down. I drew out my laser 
and waited, aiming. 

Soapy water had splashed out 
here on the bright black topping of 
the wide deck and as the dishwash- 
er came humming from the kitch- 
en into the sunlight it took a skid. 
Its arms clutched air, flapped, and 
it whirled wildly past me. It hit the 
redwood rail and went right on 
through, falling toward the ocean, 
followed by splintered wood. After 
the giant splash came big bubbles. 

Three white gulls came skim- 
ming in low over the water. They 
danced a second or two over the 
last of the bubbles and then soared 



up into the clear sky. I hung up my 
laser and went carefully back into 
the beach cottage. 

The stove looked like it could be 
nasty in a fight but apparently it 
wasn’t gimmicked. Nothing else in 
Mary Redlafld’s empty beach 
house came for me. 

In the beam-ceilinge.d living 
room the phone on the missing 
girl’s marble-top coffee table be- 
g^n to buzz. I watched it, ap- 
proaching it from the side. It 
looked to be only a phone and I 
decided to answer it. 

“Tom,” said the lank dark 
young man who appeared on the 
saucer-sized viewscreen, “is she 
there?” 

“No, Oliver,” I told him. “At 
least I don’t think so. I just ar- 
rived.” 

I glanced toward the view win- 
dow. It showed a quiet ocean. 

“Tom, you look distracted,” 
said Oliver Bentancourt. 

I finally caught sight of the dish- 
washer swimming out to sea. Do- 
ing a fair Australian crawl with 
those unexpected arms. 

“I was looking at the dishwash- 
er,” I said. 

“How’s that going to help us 
find out where Mary’s been for the 
last two days?” 

I sat on the paisley-patterned so- 
fa and said, “This dishwasher is 
out in the Pacific, swimming.” 

“Oh, you mean some guy who 
works in a restaurant. Who is he?” 

“No, I mean an appliance, 

IF

square squatty thing about half my 
size,” I said. 

I took another look at the bright 
ocean. The machine was quite far 
out now and had switched to a rap- 
id backstroke. 

“How can it swim?” 

“It has little arms,” I said. 
Bentancourt rubbed a lean hand 
over his eyes. “I guess you’re not 
kidding, Tom. I don’t know. May- 
be it’s because of her late father 
that she’s got an odd machine 
there. I don’t know. Mary is — well, 
she isn’t like anyone I’ve known 
before. I really didn’t want to con- 
sult your agency, you know. But 
since you and I have been friends 
since catechism class days I fig- 
ured you wouldn’t be working for 
Stanley Pope unless he was okay. 
Where is Mary?” 

“Easy, now. We’ll find her. 
Stanley Pope specializes in cases 
that are a little eccentric.” 

“I don’t want to use the police,” 
said Bentancourt. “You know — 
because Mary has a pretty unhap- 
py medical record. Well, psycholo- 
gical record rather. She’s still in 
therapy. The police aren’t too un- 
derstanding.” 

“Right.” 

“I’ve called her friends, such as 
they are. I even tried to see if any- 
body was still at the old family 
place.” He hid his eyes again for a 
moment. “She’s not there? I mean, 
she didn’t take something again?” 
“No,” I said, though I wasn’t 
yet certain. 



“Okay,” said Bentancourt. “I’ll 
call you tonight.” 

He nodded, smiled quickly and 
faded from the screen. 

The dishwasher was only a speck 
now, a desert-colored dot heading 
for the horizon. I rubbed my chin, 
then scratched my chest with both 
hands. I went all through the three- 
room beach house and Mary Red- 
land was not there. Nothing I 
found told me where she might be. 

P OPE was out on his court, 
playing tennis with a robot. I 
sat down in one of the wrought- 
iron benches ringing the green clay. 
Down through the trees and house- 
tops I could see a flock of sail- 
boats on Sausalito’s piece of the 
bay. 

“I’m perfecting my serve,” Pope 
called to me. 

He flung a fuzzy white ball 
straight up, kept his eye on it, 
whapped it over the net. 

“You’re using a badminton 
racket,” I pointed out. 

The robot was shaped like a wa- 
ter heater and had four arms. It 
rolled after the tennis ball and 
sucked it up off the court with a 
little nozzle. 

Pope blinked. Wrinkles ran up 
his high forehead and were lost in 
his tight curly black hair. 

“Huh?” 

New rings joined those under his 
wide, circled eyes. 

“Badminton racket.” I inclined 
my head in its direction. 



WHAT'S BECOME OF SCREWLOOSE? 



81 




He scrutinized the racket, nod- 
ded. 

“I must have left the tennis 
racket in the copter.” 

“Copter?” 

“I was test-flying a new copter.” 
He waved at the robot. “Game’s 
over.” 

“I thought you gave up on cop- 
ters.” 

“They have a tendency to 
crash,” he said, “into the Golden 
Gate Bridge.” 

“When you’re piloting.” 
“Anyway, I decided to give cop- 
ters one more chance.” 

“And?” 

“This one crashed into the Gold- 
en Gate Bridge.” 

I noticed the robot was speeding 
toward the tennis net. 

“Your robot thinks he just lost 
the game.” 

“Huh?” 

“He’s going to jump over the 
net and congratulate you.” 

Pope turned. He was a lean, 
middle-sized man, nearly as dark 
as I am. 

“Don’t,” he yelled as the robot 
leaped up into the air. 

The tennis-playing machine 
didn’t quite clear the net. It tum- 
bled over front first with a clang, 
scattering tennis balls. 

“Gadgets,” said Pope. He ran to 
the fallen robot and helped it up. 
“I had a chance to inherit a hun- 
dred acres of soy beans in the San 
Joaquin Valley, Tom. Instead I 
surrounded myself with gadgets.” 



“Sorry, sorry,” said the robot, 
feeling itself for damages with all 
its hands. 

Pope left the machine and came 
over on the grass with me. 

“What about this missing girl — 
Mary Redman?” 

“Redland.” 

“1 worry about all these gadgets 
the way some people worry about 
pets. I get nervous and concerned 
when they fall down.” He blinked 
again and new rings appeared 
around his eyes. “What do 1 take 
at six o’clock?” 

I reached a bottle of blue span- 
sules out of my jacket pocket. 

“Two of these.” 

“Well, I probably would have 
worried about soy beans, too.” 
Pope shook two spansules into his 
palm, frowned. “Except soy beans 
don’t fall down as much. Any trace 
of the girl?” 

“No,” I said. “But her dish- 
washing machine tried to kill me.” 

He swallowed, rubbed his fore- 
finger along the side of his beaked 
nose. 

“Huh? Give me all the details.” 

I described what had happened. 
Absently Pope undid his white ten- 
nis shorts and let them drop. 

“1 should have gone over there 
with you. Why didn’t I?” 

“You had to go to San Francis- 
co, remember.” 

“Oh, yes. One of my former 
wives is after more alimony. The 
second one, right?” 

“No, the third,” I said. “Why

are you taking off your clothes?” 
“Changing for dinner.” 

“You’re still outside.” 

“Huh?” Pope bent and retrieved 
the fallen shorts, tucked them un- 
der his arm with his badminton 
racket. “I had a chance to go into 
the fishmeal business once. There’s 
a lot less pressure in the fishmeal 
business than in the private investi- 
gation field. Right?” 

“I haven’t seen any statistics.” 
We continued across his slightly 
overgrown two-acre backyard, 
moving in the direction of Pope’s 
big transplanted Victorian house. 
“What did that homicidal dish? 
washer remind you of? You did a 
particular kind of reaction take 
when I mentioned it.” 

“Huh?” Pope stroked his nose. 
“Something I can’t quite remem- 
ber. But it ties in with this Mary 
Redland business.” He stopped 
walking. “I really like the odd 
cases, Tom. Most of what we do 
know is simple electronic stuff. 
Bugging, counter-bugging, siphon- 
ing of computer information. Back 
when you were still in school 
someplace there were more odd 
things to work on. Her father.” 
“Mary Redland’s father?” 
“Right. He was a servomecha- 
nism tycoon, wasn’t he?” 

“That and teaching machines,” I 
said. “My friend Bentancourt says 
Mary didn’t talk much about her 
father. He died a year or so ago, 
in an autosonic jet crash. I know 
the few times I met her she didn’t 



want to talk about the past at all.” 

“This name that your friend told 
us scared her, upset her — what was 
it?” 

“Screwloose,” I told him. 

“Right. A nickname for some- 
body maybe. Your friend hasn’t 
any notions?” 

“Nothing new since he first con- 
sulted us.” 

“Mary Redland was in a therapy 
group over in Frisco, right. How 
long?” 

“Three months. And, according 
to Bentancourt, she mentioned the 
name Screwloose during a session 
at this Dollfuss Center. He wasn’t 
in the group with her but she told 
him about it afterwards. Because 
it scared her. A silly name but she 
was unsettled. Apparently that was 
all she was able to remember, just 
the name or whatever it is. Screw- 
loose. Bentancourt figures maybe 
she remembered something else 
day before yesterday. Maybe that’s 
why she took off.” 

“Why should she be remember- 
ing things?” asked Pope as we 
climbed the wide wooden back 
stairs of his vast rococo white 
house. “Did Bentancourt say she’d 
lost her memory at some point?” 

“No, but she’s had a breakdown 
or two and there seem to be cer- 
tain things she has had trouble re- 
calling.” 

“Slender girl, isn’t she?” 

“He showed you her picture.” 

“I know. Willowy, tall. Blonde,” 
said Pope. “Thin women tend to be

WHAT'S BECOME OF SCREWLOOSE? 




twitchy. My second wife was.” 
“Third,” I said. “Your second 
wife was a plump redhead with 
dimples.” 

Pope sighed. We were in the 
kitchen. 

“Maybe I should have stayed 
with her and taken up soy beans, 
huh? Go to the Dollfuss Center 
and sit in on that group therapy 
session. Mary Redland was going 
every Tuesday and Thursday night 
at eight, wasn’t she?” 

“Yes. There’s a session tonight. 
You figure she may show up there, 
even though she’s been out of view 
for two days?” 

“No. I want you to find out 
what reminded her of Screwloose.” 
He nodded at his refrigerator 
and it opened and handed him a 
cold bottle of ale. 

P OPE gestured uphill at the 
houseboat after I’d given him 
a verbal report on my visit to the 
group therapy session the night be- 
fore. 

“We’ll go up to Past after 
breakfast. Did I order orange 
juice?” 

We were under a metal umbrella 
out on a plank shelf over the edge 
of the Bay, at a restaurant called 
The Ruins Of Tiburon Tommy’s. 

“Tomato,” I said. I removed a 
pill from a box I carried in my left 
trouser pocket and put it on the 
edge of his soycafe saucer. “I’m 
sorry I didn’t turn up anything on 
Screwloose. Why Past?” 



“Something,” said Pope. He no- 
ticed a plate of plankton griddle 
cakes in front of him on the table. 
“I like to use Evelynski to supple- 
ment my memory sometimes.” 
“Didn’t they indict Evelynski for 
siphoning classified information 
out of the California State Credit 
Computer?” 

“They couldn’t. No evidence.” 

“I thought they had evidence.” 
“Evelynski managed to siphon 
off all that, too.” Pope was wear- 
ing a buff overall suit today. He 
rubbed his palms on his knees and 
the material gave off a purring 
sound. “Go back on what you told 
me last night. At the therapy ses- 
sion you said one of the group 
talked about Mary. He said some- 
thing about how her late father had 
paid a lot of attention to her, es- 
pecially to her education?” 

“Yes, a bi"g jovial pink guy in 
his middle forties. His name is 
Chuck Mogul,” I answered. 
“When I asked him if he knew her 
he said he’d only read about her 
family a lot in the society col- 
umns. Years ago. Dr. Dollfuss is 
an admirer of yours — otherwise 
they probably wouldn’t have let me 
sit in. He mentioned your eclectic 
mind.” 

“Right.” Pope looked once 
more at the pancakes, then stood. 
“Let’s go up and consult Evelyn- 
ski.” 

Past is a private research organ- 
ization. When all the houseboats 
were cleared out of the waters

IF 




around Sausalito Cosmo Evelyn- 
ski had one moved to a lot in the 
low rolling hills of Tiburon. The 
big red-and-white boat served now 
as the top floor of his archives, 
with ten more floors sunk down in- 
to the hillside. 

Evelynski’s office was in the liv- 
ing room of the old houseboat and 
we found him there dropping 
punch cards into an electric waste- 
basket. The basket would chew up 
a card, making a lopsided growl- 
ing sound. Then it would spew the 
fragments back out at Evelynski. 

Evelynski was sitting on a low 
wicker stool, a confetti of shreds 
on the hardwood floor around 
him. 

“On the fritz,” he said. 

He was a tall man in his low for- 
ties, short-haired and mildly rustic. 

Pope took a seat on a plaid ot- 
toman. The rings around his eyes 
were flickering. “About twenty 
years ago,” he said, “something 
like four men who were all promi- 
nent in the servomechanism field 
died. I’ve been trying to remember 
the details.” 

“Hello, Tom,” Evelynski said to 
me. He kicked the wastebasket 
away with his left foot. “You’re 
thinking about a murder case, 
Stanley?” 

Pope said, “It’s not on record as 
such. All four of these guys died in 
a six-month period, all in acci- 
dents. They were, though nothing 
much was made of it as I recall, 
the chief competitors of what’s his 



name. Donald B. Redland. Mary 
Redland’s father.” 

“Redland of United/Tech?” Ev- 
elynski stood up and crossed to a 
dumbwaiter in the wall. 

Pope nodded. “In one of these 
accidental deaths there was some- 
thing — something about an eyewit- 
ness. A little boy nobody believed. 
He claimed he’d seen a soft-drink 
machine push the victim off the 
edge of a bluff in Muir Woods 
someplace. A foggy day, nobody 
else saw anything.” 

“The dishwasher,” I said. 
“Reminded me,” said Pope. 
Evelynski opened the door to the 
shaft and yelled, “Freak Accidents. 
Also Redland, Donald Bascomb. 
Muir Woods, vicinity, accidents. 
Servomech industry, obits. Any- 
thing else you can think of.” He 
let the small white door flap shut. 
“I’ve dug down two more floors 
since you guys were here last.” 

“Did you fix that computer who 
would only take requests given in 
classical Greek?” asked Pope. 

“He just outgrew it. He was new 
then and showing off. You know, 
the runt in the pack.” Evelynski 
made his way around the circular 
room and stood next to the mouth 
of a metal chute. Far down under 
us a faint fluttering whir had start- 
ed. In another thirty seconds file 
folders, tape reels, punch cards, 
loose clippings and glossy photos 
poured out into Evelynski’s arms. 

“Here,” he said and dropped the 
pile of material on Pope’s lap. 



WHAT'S BECOME OF SCREWLOOSE? 



85 




Three newspaper clippings fell in 
the process. I reached them off the 
hook rug and glanced at them. The 
headline on the largest clipping, a 
half page with photo, read: “Penin- 
sula Girl Has A Special Sort of 
Teacher.” The girl, six then, was 
Mary Redland and her special tu- 
tor was an android teacher especi- 
ally designed by her father, Donald 
B. Redland, and built under his su- 
pervision at United/Tech in nearby 
Sunnyvale. The story said Mary 
liked the teaching robot “an awful 
lot” and the family nickname for 
him was Professor Screwloose. 
There was a picture of Mary and 
the android in a bright playroom. I 
held the clipping out to Pope. 
“Here’s Screwloose,” I said. 
“Oh, so?” He took the clipping. 
“Also Chuck Mogul,” I added. 
“You’re getting slipshod, Tom,” 
said Pope. “One of the six people 
you spent two hours with last night 
is an android and you didn’t tum- 
ble to it.” 

“Nope,” I admitted. “He’s got 
a lot of believability. He struck me 
as a phony — but a human phony.” 
Pope tapped the photo. “This 
was taken at the Redland place 
down on the Peninsula, wasn’t it?” 
“That’s right,” I said. “The es- 
tate’s been empty since Redland 
was killed. Nobody’s living there. 
But supposedly it’s still guarded by 
a lot of Redland’s mechanisms.” 
“Huh?” said Pope. He rolled up 
the piece of newspaper and rubbed 
it across the tip of his sharp nose. 



“I wonder if Mary Redland’s gone 
there. What she’s trying to remem- 
ber has to do with this damn an- 
droid and probably with that old 
house.” 

“I’d better drive over there and 
check,” I said. 

“After we go through the rest of 
this stuff, yes,” said Pope. “Stop 
at my place and gather up some 
tools for jobbing the burglar 
alarms. We have something or 
other for stunning robots, don’t 
we?” 

“Yes. Do you want to come 
along this time?” 

“No, I want to call on Chuck 
Mogul,” said Pope. “You said 
Dollfuss records show him with a 
San Francisco address?” 

“Yes, Telegraph Hill.” I wrote 
the address on a memo slip. 

“I want to ask him why he’s no 
longer Screwloose,” said Pope. 

N OTHING was working at the 
Redland estate. I’d parked my 
land car three hundred yeards be- 
yond the front stone wall, in the 
shadows of a grove of black oaks. 
The day was ending early and a 
prickly mist was tumbling out of 
the darkening sky as I walked 
carefully toward the front gates. 
The gates were twice my height 
and twisted into patterns of Rs and 
grape leaves. The gate was the kind 
that gave off an alarm ring if 
touched and an electric wire net- 
ting grew up to six inches above 
the high thick stone wall. Flood-

IF 




lights had been aimed at the 
cleared ground on the visitor’s side 
of the gate and just on the other 
side of the wrought iron a black 
police dog crouched, fangs bared. 

But none of it was working. The 
floodlights weren’t on, the robot 
dog was silent and there was no life 
in his vinyl eyes. The gates had 
swung open a few feet. I’d been 
prepared to try to gimmick the 
alarm system and pick any locks I 
ran into. I had a brown nearleather 
attache case under my arm. I 
didn’t need it. I walked through the 
gates. 

The mist fell and rolled, thicken- 
ing. Far away, back on the high- 
way, a diesel truck groaned by. 
Passing the mechanical watch dog, 
I brushed against him and he fell 
over sideways. I could see the 
shape of the house now, a quarter 
of a mile away. Cupolas and spires 
and weather cocks jabbing free of 
the mist. The main house was 
three stories, twenty-five rooms. A 
six-car garage with chauffeur’s 
suite, a copter hangar and two 
small guest houses were supposed 
to be beyond and behind the main 
house. 

The grass had been recently cut. 
It had a damp fresh-cropped smell. 
The trees, hundreds of birches and 
willows and pines, were less cared 
for. Approaching the house, I saw 
an android sprawled in the brush. 
He was a gardening robot and he 
seemed to have fallen from a lad- 
der while pruning. He was broken 



and beginning to rust. His bent 
hand still clutched a pair of shears, 
orange now from exposure. 

There was only darkness in the 
main house. I went around it, lis- 
tening. I crossed a stable yard and 
saw light. A fluttering unsteady 
glow coming from a cottage deep 
among willows. I went toward 
that. 

A metal plate screwed to the 
cottage said: Miss Mary Red- 
land/Her Playhouse. I knocked. 
The motion of my knocking 
pushed the door open. Inside the 
small room was Mary. She was 
sitting in a low wooden chair, her 
legs bent up and tightly together. 
On a child-size desk beside her 
stood a kerosene lantern, sooty 
smoke fluming up from it. 

“Hello, Mary,” I said. 

She looked up, nodded, smiled 
faintly and briefly. 

“Hello, Tom.” 

“This is where you’ve been?” 

“Most of the time,” Her pretti- 
ness seemed to come and go on her 
face, wavering like the lantern 
light. “I guess Ollie hired you to 
come looking for me.” 

“That’s right.” I took a lopsided 
sofa chair for a seat. There were 
shelves climbing the walls, clut- 
tered with toys. Simple stuffed toys 
and complex mechanical ones. Be- 
low the shelves were teaching 
machines and film viewers, spools 
of history and math piled atop 
them. 

“Somebody is always and con-

tinually looking after me,” said 
Mary. “Since always.” She locked 
her slim hands over one knee. “I 
remembered some things and I 
came back here to think about 
them. To reflect, more or less.” 

I watched her in silence. 

“They never,” said Mary, 
“thought I’d remember. And I 
didn’t, actually, quite remember 
for a long time. Then I began to.” 

I stayed quiet. 

“Fifteen. No, twenty. Twenty 
years almost,” said Mary. “When 
I was about six years old. My fa- 
ther and one other man who 
worked for him. They’re both dead 
now. I suppose that’s funny. Twen- 
ty years ago they killed four peo- 
ple.” 

“Rivals,” I said. “People your 
father couldn’t buy out?” 

“His ambition was to become 
much bigger. He did, too,” said 
Mary. “They, my father and the 
other man, came up with a fine and 
simple idea. Not something that 
would seem simple to me or possi- 
bly to you — only to them. He 
could have kept trying to deal with 
them Financially, buy them. Except 
this new idea was simpler and not 
as expensive. So they figured out 
how to adapt some of their fine 
machines and mechanisms. Adapt 
them to kill people. Not in any ob- 
vious ways, though. To push them 
out of windows or arrange acci- 
dents. There’s a funny side to that, 
too, being killed by your refrigera- 
tor or your color TV console.” 

I nodded. 



“I met one of those machines.” 

“Yes, I guess a few of them are 
still around,” she said, “to keep an 
eye on me. I gave up trying to 
avoid all the mechanisms dad 
thought should keep track of me. 
You probably saw it in that beach 
house dad bought for me.” 

“That’s right.” 

Mary said, “The problem \vas, 
the problem was I walked in.” 

“On a killing?” 

She shook her head. “No, on 
the planning of one. They were 
very thorough. They made charts 
and diagrams. Maybe that’s how 
you should kill people, carefully 
and with a good deal of thought 
and deliberation. I walked in. It 
was up there at the big house. In 
dad’s den, which was supposed to 
be private. I didn’t always pay at- 
tention to that kind of restriction 
then. I was six and they’d not both- 
ered to lock the door this one time. 
I walked in, very silent. Dad was 
at his long wide work table, draft- 
ing table, and they were talking. I 
listened for a long while until they 
noticed me.” The mist was thick at 
the little room’s leaded windows. 
“At First they — d;ad especially — 
tried to convince me I hadn’t heard 
anything or that it was just a 
game. The problem was, you see, 
they went right ahead and killed 
the man. So I asked about it.” She 
stood and wandered to the low 
black-and-gray machines. “This is 
where they did it.” 

“They worked to make you for- 
get?” 



88 



IF 




“Yes,” said Mary finally. “It 
used to be called — what was it? 
Brainwashing? It wasn’t going to 
hurt, dad promised. Seems to 
me — it seems to me it took weeks 
to do. They used these machines 
and some others.” She paused and 
took a sharp inward breath. “And 
my tutor. I had an android. A nice 
affable robot who taught me and 
read stories and was nice. I called 
him Professor Screwloose. I don’t 
know why, something dad said 
once is where I got the name I 
think. He helped them do it and af- 
ter that he was gone, sent some- 
place else. For years I forgot, 
didn’t remember. Except it started 
trying to come back. You know, I 
had some problems. Yes. I went 
into therapy finally and I really be- 
gan to remember.” She turned to 
me. “He was there, though I didn’t 
realize it at first.” 

“Screwloose,” I said. 

“Yes,” she said. “Calling him- 
self Chuck Mogul and passing for 
human. I guess dad had pro- 
gramed him to keep watch on me. 
Even with dad gone, nobody turned 
poor Screwloose off. He’s still 
hanging around, watching after 
me. Protecting me. I suppose he’s 
anxious to keep me from remem- 
bering, even though it doesn’t 
make much difference now.” 

paint me as not too nice a 

X guy,” said Chuck Mogul. He 
came into the cottage grinning. 
There was a black pistol in his be- 



lievable right hand. “Gee, Mary. 
We have meant nothing but good 
for you.” 

She leaned against the black 
machines. 

“It’s all over, Professor Screw- 
loose.” 

“No, I don’t feel that,” said the 
android. “Gosh, your dad, god 
bless him and keep him, set me up 
swell, Mary. With funds and a nice 
place on Telegraph Hill in San 
Francisco. All I haye to do, as 
long as I live, is look after you. 
Not only to keep yop from think- 
ing about some unpleasant things 
that might have happened when 
you were a cute little tossle-headed 
kid. No, I’m dedicated to seeing to 
it you have a calm, pleasant life al- 
ways.” 

“Good Christ,” said the girl. 
“My father was enough. I don’t 
want any more sweet concern. I’m 
me now, full grown — and I don’t 
want you.” 

“Gosh, Mary,” said Screw- 
loose. “Don’t talk like that. I’m 
always going to be around. I’m — 
gee — I’m made that way, honey.” 

“You shouldn’t have,” I said, 
“gotten so close. Shouldn’t have 
gone to the therapy sessions.” 

The android agreed. “I debated 
a lot about that. Gosh, but I was 
worried. About what she might 
blurt out there in front of the oth- 
ers. So I took a risk, pulled a few 
strings and got in the same group 
with her. No, I have to admit that

NEAL BARRETT, Jr. 



The generation gap was a grim reality — but 
Klay welder never suspected its longevity! 



K LAYWELDER landed the 
Glory B as gently as babys’ 
breath. The gravities held a quar- 
ter-inch above the ground as the 
big engines hummed down the 
scale and sighed. 

Klaywelder sighed with them. 
Then, without a glance outside, he 
pulled himself up quickly from the 
pilot’s couch and walked the few 
feet to his quarters. At the foot of 
his bunk he carefully pressed his 
right thumb against a particular 
spot on the bulkhead. The deck 
beneath him shuddered and 
screeched in protest as its atoms 
were harshly realigned. The metal 
surrounding his cargo was now 
unmetal— a horrid molecular mess 



with all the spectographic purity 
of scrambled eggs. 

Klaywelder nodded with satis- 
faction. No one, not even Klay- 
welder himself, could open it now 
— only the peculiar little character 
on Filo who had installed the thing 
could wrench it back to normal 
without melting down the ship. 

Klaywelder strolled back to the 
cabin and stuffed his pipe with 
Guubi weed. The first puff made 
him gag. He scowled and knocked 
the bowl out on the deck. Earth 
tobacco, he promised himself, 
would be First on his list. And with 
what he had in the hold he could 
well afford the best, this time. 

He glanced through the port at 




tjie rolling, sage-green hills and 
whipped-cream skies. Last stop, 
Pharalell IV, and then home — and 
more credits than even he had ever 
dreamed of. 

Klaywelder’s smug contentment 
turned to mild annoyance. The 
domed entryport at the edge of the 
field looked like an ugly pink hive 
— and now, out of that hive 
swarmed three angry silver hor- 
nets, making their way for the 
Glory B. 

As the hornets drew closer they 
turned into glittering speedsters. 
Klaywelder spotted the tiny Fed- 
eration emblems on their sides. 
Two of the speedsters carried cus- 
toms guards with dark rifles 
bouncing off their backs. The third 
held the short, stocky frame of 
Arto Frank. 

Klaywelder bit his lip. He hadn’t 
seen Arto in six years — and Arto 
was the last person he’d hoped to 
run into on Pharalell IV. 

Klaywelder dropped to the 
ground and closed the port behind 
him. Frank burned rubber inches 
from his boots. 

“Uhuh. I thought so.” Arto 
Frank eyed him grimly. “What do 
you want here, Klaywelder?” He 
didn’t wait for an answer. His 
head jerked to one side and mo- 
tioned the other speedsters. “Mac, 
Artie — seal the ship.” . 

The guards braced kickstands 
and moved forward. 

“Hold it,” warned Klaywelder. 

The guards looked at each 



other, then at Frank. Klaywelder 
backed against the hull and point- 
edly pressed a bright stud at his 
belt. Frank watched him from nar- 
rowed eyes. 

Klaywelder folded his arms. 

“I just wanted to get this whole 
little scene down on film, Arto. 
All right, now tell ’em.” 

Frank showed the barest instant 
of hesitation. Klaywelder smiled 
to himself. He reached into his 
tunic and tossed Frank a neat blue 
packet. Frank caught the object 
without looking at it. 

“Travel Clearance,” said Klay- 
welder. “Ship’s Registry, Owner- 
ship Certificate, Parole Papers and 
Federation Tourist Visa.” 

“Tourist Visa,” Frank repeated 
and looked at him without expres- 
sion. Then he turned his head and 
nodded slightly at the two guards. 
They pressed their speedsters to 
life and roared off across the field. 

“You can turn off the gimmicks 
now,” said Frank. “If you had 
them on in the first place.” 

“I did,” said Klaywelder. He 
pressed another stud. “I’m not un- 
der arrest, then?” 

“No.” Frank faced Klaywelder 
squarely. “You’re not under ar- 
rest. What you’re under is a thirty- 
two-hour surveillance until you 
break atmosphere.” 

“That’s harrassment — ” 

“You can forget the guardhouse 
law, Klaywelder,” Frank said flat- 
ly. “Just remember this. As Fed- 
eration Customs Officer on Phar- 



92 



IF 




alell Four I can arrest you if you 
break the law here, lock you up, 
seal your ship or send you right 
back to Barrion for breaking pa- 
role. I’ll do that, Klaywelder, if 
you so much as step on the grass. 
Understood?” 

Klaywelder nodded. 

“Just 4> set the record 
straight,” Frank added quietly, “I 
know why you’re here. I’ve even 
got a fair idea where you’ve been.” 
He glanced up at the ship’s dark 
hull. “I can smell contraband fur, 
Klaywelder — behind eighteen 

inches of titaniuirf. I’m sure you 
have a nice hoard in there. I’m just 
as sure you could turn the whole 
cache into carbon before I could 
get a Search & Seizure.” 

Frank shook his head. “I 
wouldn’t go to the trouble. Just 
remember — ” he poked a menac- 
ing finger at Klaywelder — “you’re 
not dealing with animals here. The 
Pharalellians are intelligent beings 
under Federation protection. You 
lay one hand on a Pharalell 
pelt—” 

“Arto!” Klaywelder let an ex- 
pression of shock cross his face. 

“Uhuh. Sure.” Frank stared at 
him distastefully. “I forgot. 
You’re a tourist. Just don’t you 
forget, Klaywelder.” 

With a final look of disdain, he 
mounted his speedster and disap- 
peared across the blue tarmac. 

T HROUGH long years on the 
outer fringes of the law — and 



somewhat beyond — Klaywelder 
had learned to maintain an outer 
calm in spite of inner feelings. It 
was difficult to hold onto that 
control now. 

Difficult? It was all he could do 
to keep from shouting, jumping 
up and down, turning handsprings. 
Arto Frank was right, of course. 
There was indeed a lovely cache of 
furs beneath the metallic fruitcake 
of his deck — heavy, cobalt-blue 
Rhinofox from Claxin, incredibly 
fine Sapphurs from Ebbinode and 
fifty-thousand rare microfurs 
from Deserexx — inch-long plati- 
num pelts from the tiny minkmice, 
who conveniently welded them- 
selves together in death to form 
long, silky stoles. 

And all those goodies looked 
like so much boar bristle next to 
what he was seeing now. 

He strolled beneath the feath- 
ery, sage-blue trees in the central 
plaza of Ochassh, the town nearest 
Pharalell’s sole spaceport. He felt 
a little like an ant at a convention 
of beetles. The Pharalellians were 
roughly the size of teenage ele- 
phants but there was nothing re- 
motely elephantine about them. 
They strolled gracefully and ma- 
jestically about the plaza — four 
long legs moving in rhythm with 
shorter forearms hanging from 
shoulder height. If a prize Afghan 
were mated with an oversized ant- 
eater, Klaywelder decided, their 
progeny might look something 
like a Pharalellian.

93 




But Klaywelder only absently 
noted these minor characteristics 
—for covering those great bodies 
from head to toe was the most in- 
describably glorious fur he had 
ever seen. It was finer than a spi- 
der’s gossamer strands. It had the 
sheen of a lovely woman’s hair by 
moonlight, the sparkle of a dew- 
covered leaf in early morn, just 
touched by the sun. And it came in 
blacker than jet, in breathtaking 
amber, in fleeting cream — and in 
every other shade he could imag- 
ine. Knowing -his special custom- 
ers as he did, Klaywelder was sure 
each pelt — just to be ultra-conser- 
vative — Klaywelder gave up. 

Counting credits in stacks that 
high made him dizzy. 

He played tourist for the rest of 
the afternoon. He bought exam- 
ples of carved Dinii wood, a favor- 
ite Pharalell souvenir. He sent half 
a dozen postcards to people he had 
never heard of and ignored Arto 
Frank’s man, who had not been 
more than twenty yards behind 
him all day. 

At sundown, he walked back to 
the ship, had a leisurely meal and 
fell into a peaceful sleep. His 
dreams were so erotic and furry 
he almost blushed passing the mir- 
ror on the way in to breakfast. 

Klaywelder had managed to 
stay out of jail more often than 
he’d been forced to stay in. He was 
sure, in his own mind, this was be- 
cause he took his work seriously 
and went about each job with a 



surgeon’s care. He had learned a 
lot about Pharalellians before 
landing on the planet. He knew 
they were extremely religious, ex- 
haustingly polite and unbelievably 
naive. All three qualities placed 
them in an almost textbook Cate- 
gory AAA — which meant they 
were rigidly protected by Federa- 
tion edict against people like 
Klaywelder. 

On the other hand, the Phara- 
lellians’ own mores and manners 
tied Arto Frank’s hands very nice- 
ly. Frank could in no way warn 
the Pharalellians against him. Dis- 
courtesy to any living creature — 
and that included bad-mouthing 
fur thieves — was a most extreme 
no-no. Frank, then, could not 
make a move until and if Klay- 
welder stepped out of line. 

And that Klaywelder wasn’t 
about to do — certainly not in any 
way discernible to Arto Frank. 

I T WAS the largest house on the 
square — large even by Phara- 
lellian standards. Sun-washed 
white stone flowed into subtle pas- 
tels of pink and green. A high, 
ornate metal gate graced a vine- 
covered entryway. 

The big Pharalellian moved se- 
dately out of his doorway and into 
the street. Klaywelder faultlessly 
allowed himself to be crowded off 
the stone walk. He flailed his arms 
wildly, then collapsed in a horrible 
heap. He lay there unmoving, his 
head cocked ominously against 
the curb. 



94 



IF 




The Pharalellian stiffened, then 
cringed visibly. 

“Siim shave me!” it cried. 
“What have I done?” 

Klaywelder moaned. The Phara- 
lellian swooped down and laid a 
beautifully furry hand across his 
brow. “I am Steressh-shi,” it said 
gently. “You will call me Garii, 
please. It is a name reserved for 
intimate friends who have known 
me at least forty seasons. You 
have by my discourtesy earned the 
right to use it. Are you hurt 
badly?” 

Klaywelder sat up and blinked. 

“I’m all right. I think.” He 
shook his head. Then his eyes 
widened. “Oh, no — ” 

Garii stiffened. “You are in- 
jured, then?” 

“No, it’s not that.” Klaywelder 
began frantically searching the 
street around him. “My physical 
body is of no consequence. Not 
when my spiritual well-being is 
threatened.” 

Garii’s eyes quivered under his 
furry brow. “Your — spiritual — ” 

“Yes.” Klaywelder nodded. “I 
can’t seem to find my pouch. It 
was here — I wear it around my 
neck on a silver chain — ” 

The Pharalellian bent down to 
join the search. “This pouch — it is 
important to you?” 

Klaywelder sighed. “It is only 
my ticket into Paradise, nothing 
more.” 

Garii sucked in a deep breath. 

“It contains the nail parings of 



my father and his fathers before 
him,” Klaywelder explained som- 
berly. “As I am the ninth son of 
the ninth virgin, the pouch con- 
taining the male spirits of my 
family is naturally in my trust.” 
“Yes, naturally.” Garii was 
openly trembling now. “Our ways 
are strikingly similar.” 

“You noticed that?” Klaywelder 
peered under a loose bit of paving. 
“Actually, that’s why I’ve been so 
anxious to visit Pharalell Four. I 
truly believe my people have a 
strong spiritual kinship with 
yours.” 

“Oh, yes — indeed!” Tears rolled 
down Garii’s eyes, staining his sil- 
very pelt a light cobalt blue. “And 
I, through gross stupidity, have 
banned your soul from the Thou- 
sand Rooms of Infinite Pleasure!” 
“It’s nothing, really,” said 
Klaywelder. 

Garii swept great hands to his 
face and moaned. 

“If you will permit me I shall 
begin Atonement by tearing out 
my visual organs. It is a small 
thing — but a start — ” 

“No, please,” said Klaywelder. 
“Ah — there’s my pouch. It was 
under your foot all the time.” 

Garii stifled another moan. 
“Now I have trod upon your fa- 
thers. Visual organs alone will not 
suffice.” 

“No problem,” Klaywelder said • 
easily. “They’re found.” He 
hooked the pouch around his 
neck. “That’s what’s important.” 



GRANDFATHER PELTS 



95 




The Pharalellian gently helped 
him to his feet. “You must enter 
my house, now. I have much in- 
debtedness to overcome.” 

“Oh, no.” Klaywelder yawned 
absently. “I wouldn’t consider dis- 
turbing you.” 

Garii’s mouth opened in horror. 
“I could not blame you for refus- 
ing. I have no right to ask. Still 
— ” he faced Klaywelder with 
pleading eyes — “I beg you not to 
leave me with no chance of Atone- 
ment.” 

Klaywelder watched the sun 
form fascinating whorls of color 
on Garii’s fur. Out of the corner 
of his eye he could see Arto 
Frank’s man frowning in puzzle- 
ment at the edge of the plaza. 

“All right,” he said finally. “If 
you really insist.” 

“My gratitude is unbounded, 
sir.” 

Klaywelder shrugged. “You can 
call me Klay.” 

G ARII insisted Klaywelder 
spend the remainder of his 
stay on Pharalell IV in his home. 
Klaywelder declined and the Pha- 
ralellian nearly removed his visual 
organs again before it was ex- 
plained that Klaywelder could not 
possible spend nights outside his 
ship since his ancestral altars were 
located there and could not be 
moved. 

Garii understood. But during 
the daylight hours Klay must al- 
low his host the opportunity to 



work at full Atonement. That, 
Klaywelder agreed, seemed fair 
enough. 

Klaywelder was not about to 
spend a night away from the Glory 
B. Not that Arto Frank could 
possibly do any damage there but 
Klaywelder did not intend to give 
him the chance. Besides that, he 
wanted Frank to establish a nor- 
mal Klaywelder day-night pattern 
in his mind. 

A T SUNSET on the third day 
Frank pulled up beside him 
on the narrow road from Ochassh 
to the spaceport. 

Klaywelder greeted him with a 
slightly lopsided grin. He was 
more than a little high— mentally 
and physically. Wine had flowed 
freely at the party, and Garii made 
certain his guest-of-honor’s cup 
was never empty. Every swallow, 
it seemed, was a step closer to full 
Atonement. 

There was more. Klaywelder 
was dizzy from mingling with the 
twenty or thirty Pharalellians as- 
sembled to meet him. Each one’s 
pelt was more magnificent and 
multi-hued than any he had imag- 
ined before he came to Pharalell 
IV. 

Frank studied him. 

“You’re going ahead with it, 
aren’t you?” he said Finally. “I can 
read it all over you.” He shook 
his head. “Klaywelder — ” 

“I don’t know what you’re talk- 
ing about, ’ r said Klaywelder. “I’m

up to my ears in Pharalellian wine 
at the moment, Arto. My host — 
Steressh-shi, to you — I can’t re- 
veal his intimate name to strang- 
ers but — ” 

Frank’s speedster jerked ahead 
abruptly, wheeled to block Klay- 
welder’s path. 

“Listen,” Frank said darkly, “I 
know what it’s all about. I’ve 
known since the minute you set 
down here. You can’t pull it off. 
Don’t even try, Klaywelder — ” 
Klaywelder sighed. “I sense 
deep spiritual conflicts within you, 
Arto. At evening devotions I shall 
ask my ancestors to bring peace 
to your troubled soul.” 

Frank made a pointed remark 
about Klaywelder’s ancestors and 
their relation to Klaywelder him- 
self. Then he left in a cloud of dust 
and disappeared down the road. 

A S FURTHER proof of my 
Atonement, Klay, and be- 
cause I consider you a spiritual 
brother whose devotion transcends 
the boundaries between us, I hope 
you will allow me one more privi- 
lege.” 

“Only ask,” said Klaywelder. 
“You have noticed the great 
door at the end of my quarters?” 
“I may have,” said Klaywelder, 
who had noticed little else since he 
had become Garii’s guest. 

“That door leads to the Shrine 
of my Ancestors,” said Garii. “I 
would be honored if you would 
accompany me there.” 



Klaywelder lowered his eyes to 
hide his excitement. 

‘T'he toenails of my fathers are 
pleased, Garii.” 

His heart pounded against his 
chest. His research on Pharalellian 
religion had been very specific 
about ancestral shrines. 

Garii pulled a lavish key from 
the depths of his silvery fur. He in- 
serted the key in the great door 
and something clicked. The mas- 
sive panel swung open. 

Klaywelder held back a gasp. 
The room was as big as an audi- 
torium. Dark, somber columns 
arched from the walls and met 
high above in a domed ceiling. A 
single shaft of sunlight fell from a 
high pane, giving the great vault 
an aura of eternal twilight. 

Nearly a hundred candles set in 
dark red glass circled the walls — 
and spread carefully over the stone 
floor before each candle was a 
magnificent golden pelt. 

Golden . 

Klaywelder could hardly believe 
his eyes. If living Pharalell pelts 
were indescribable — what could 
you say about these? 

“It is our belief,” Garii said 
reverently, “that the degree of vir- 
tue attained by a Pharalellian is 
later reflected in the tone of his 
pelt. I am most pleased that my 
fathers and their fathers are all of 
respectable hues.” 

You can say that again. 

Garii led him silently about the 
room and Klaywelder noted that a 



GRANDFATHER PELTS

small earthen pot of wine and a 
clay dish of fruit had been placed 
before each glowing candle. 

“That is a part of my duty,” 
Garii explained proudly. “As the 
reigning male in my family, I have 
been accorded this privilege. Each 
day I bring fresh offerings of rev- 
erence.” He lowered his big head. 
“To do so brings great honor to 
me and my house.” 

Garii laid a gentle hand on 
Klay’s arm. “Come, my friend — 
now I would show you Shastalian, 
greatest of my ancestors.” 

Klaywelder followed past long 
rows of gleaming, golden pelts. 
Finally Garii stopped. “There — ” 
he pointed — “Shastalian, grand- 
father of grandfathers. A saintly 
creature and the most famed of all 
Pharalellians.” 

Klaywelder wanted to cry. He 
could hardly bear to hold his eyes 
on the rippling sea of gold at his 
feet. He was here — this close to it. 
A planet’s ransom and then some 
in one glorious pelt. 

Not that it really mattered but 
he wished briefly that he had been 
a little more imaginative about his 
own ‘religion.’ Somehow ancestral 
nail parings just didn’t quite cut it 
next to Shastalian. 

“You see, Klay,” Garii ex- 
plained solemnly, “we consider the 
Pharalellian body to be unimpor- 
tant. We are held within its bonds 
only a little while — but Eternal 
Life resides in the Pelt. When we 
are fortunate enough to move into 



that Loftier Plane the troubles, 
cares and Atonements of this exis- 
tence are left in the poor vessel we 
term the body. Your beliefs are 
similar, I think.” 

“Oh, yes,” Klaywelder said ab- 
sently, “very similar, Garii.” 
“When the time comes for one 
of us to pass on to that Higher 
Existence he is taken to a most 
sacred place. You have seen the 
large building on the other side of 
the plaza? The one trimmed in 
black and gold?” 

Klaywelder nodded. 

“That is Fakash-il Shrai. It 
means Abode of the Skinners.” 
Klaywelder swallowed. He 
looked up at Garii. 

“The — skinners?” 

“Yes. It is a most dedicated 
profession. Skinners are chosen 
from among only the highest and 
worthiest of chans. Since the body 
of a Pharalellian is never seen 
without his pelt the Skinner candi- 
dates are blinded at birth, of 
course.” 

“Of course,” said Klaywelder. 
He decided this was one phase of 
Pharalellian religion he could have 
done without. 

“They are very skilled members 
of the Priesthood,” Garii went on. 
“They must be, since it is a deli- 
cate thing to transfer the living 
soul from the body to the Pelt.” 
Klaywelder stiffened. “The — 
living soul? You mean — ” 

“Certainly,” said Garii. “There 
must be breath still in the body 



98 



IF 




when the Skinners begin their 
task.” He spread his hands. “Or 
else the soul would not go on to 
Eternal life, would it?” 

Klaywelder felt a cold chill 
creep up the back of his neck. He 
wondered how many Pharalellian 
ancients, at that last moment, 
looked up at the sharp blade and 
blinded eyes of the faithful Skin- 
ners — and decided they weren’t 
quite ready for Eternal Life as a 
golden rug. 

“You seem far away, my 
friend.” Garii’s voice held puzzle- 
ment. 

Klaywelder cleared his throat. 
“I — was, Garii. I’m so over- 
whelmed by what I’ve seen, by 
what you’ve told me — I fear I 
lapsed into meditation for a mo- 
ment. I hope you’ll forgive me.” 

Garii sighed happily. 

“Don’t apologize, Klay. To 
think that you have actually ex- 
perienced the feelings I have known 
here myself.” He stared gravely at 
Klaywelder. “Might I presume 
that my Atonement is now com- 
plete?” 

Klaywelder glanced once more 
at the great golden pelt of Shastal- 
ian, grandfather of grandfathers. 

Damn thing must weigh a good 
four or five hundred pounds. Still. 

“Yes, Garii,” he said finally. 
“I’d say that just about does it.” 

K laywelder eased through 
the lower hatch of the Glory 
B and flattened himself against the 

GRANDFATHER PELTS 



cold concrete below the ship. It 
was long past the middle hour of 
Pharalell’s night. The light in Arto 
Frank’s dome had winked out 
some time before but Klaywelder 
had waited patiently in the dark- 
ened cabin. 

Even in the Blacsuit, he felt as 
conspicuous as a blazing beacon 
crawling on his belly across the 
broad field. The skintight garment 
ate every photon of available light 
— still, he imagined Frank’s cold 
eyes cutting a blinding swath 
through the darkness. 

He was sure radar had his ship 
bracketed to the ground. If Glory 
B’s hull rose as much as a half- 
inch or the power level of her en- 
gines suddenly changed — every 
alarm in the area would scream it- 
self into a blue hemorrhage. He 
was banking on the fact that Arto 
Frank would be expecting a ship 
to leave the field^-not a man. And 
he prayed silently to his ancestors’ 
mythical toenails that Pharalell 
was too small a post to include 
body sensors as standard equip- 
ment. 

At the rear of Garii’s house, he 
pulled a small gravitic unit from 
under his Blacsuit and attached it 
to his belt. On half power he lifted 
himself over the high wall, then 
pulled himself smoothly along, in- 
ches above the clay shingles, and 
up the arching dome. 

With a suction attached to the 
single pane, he lifted the glass out 
easily with quick use of his cutter. 

99 




Then, slowly, he lowered the grav’s 
dial to one. Weight returned and 
pressed him against the tiles. He 
removed the unit and hinged a 
thin, sloping metal wedge to its 
base, forcing the wedge into its 
“load” position against a heavy 
spring. 

Finally he poked a shielded flash 
through the dome’s hole, let a thin 
smile crease his lips. There it was 
— dazzlingly bright even in the dim 
shaft of light. Shastalian. 

Klaywelder bit his lip. 

Here comes the tricky part . 

He placed the grav unit just in- 
side the edge of the dome, then 
flipped his remote until he was 
sure the unit’s weight had been suf- 
ficiently reduced to hold itself. 
When he was certain, he increased 
the weight and watched it slowly 
descend to the floor. 

It touched bottom a good 
eighteen feet from Shastalian. 
Klaywelder wiped sweat from his 
brow. The unit had no horizontal 
control. The trick was quickly to 
raise the unit a few feet, shut off 
its power, let it fall, then raise it 
again before it hit the floor— and 
repeat the procedure until he could 
get the thing moving in a series of 
parabolic arcs toward Shastalian. 

Klaywelder took a deep breath. 
The first time his hand trembled 
and the unit fell nearly to the 
floor. He tried again. He was get- 
ting the hang of the thing now, and 
the unit was moving in slow, 
graceful arcs — luckily, in the gen- 

100 



eral direction of the Shastalian 
pelt. 

Ten feet. Fifteen. Seventeen — 
now. 

Klaywelder gently halted the 
unit and lowered it to the floor. 
His heart pounded against his 
chest. He was only inches from the 
pelt — he didn’t dare press his luck 
further. Wiping his brow once 
more, he twisted the remote to full 
weight, pressing the unit below 
hard against the floor. 

Click ! 

Klaywelder winced. The noise 
seemed to echo off the stone walls 
— was much louder than he had 
expected. But— it was done. The 
spring-loaded wedge, set off by the 
unit’s weight, whipped a thin steel 
tongue under the edge of the pelt. 
By raising the unit inches at a 
time, Klaywelder slowly wormed 
the wedge under the heavy fur, cat- 
erpillar style. 

He glanced at the horizon. A 
thin line of pink was edging the 
low hills to the east. He turned 
away and concentrated on the 
problem below. There was no 
more time — the unit was nearly 
under the center of the pelt and it 
would have to do. He closed his 
eyes and turned the dial to full 
power. 

Shastalian lifted slowly off the 
floor and rose toward the ceiling, 
a shadowy golden ghost in the dim 
shaft of his light. The pelt nuzzled 
up against the top of the dome on- 
ly yards away. Klaywelder ex- 




tended a thin metal tube to the 
right length and gaffed Shastalian 
as he would a giant, furry fish. 

He had one more moment of 
panic when the pelt stuck in the 
dome’s narrow hole. Then he was 
home free. Klaywelder touched the 
pelt for the first time. A chill ran 
through his whole body. There was 
absolutely no way to compare 
Shastalian to anything. 

B RACING himself and his 
prize, he pressed a small wafer 
to his throat and mouthed a single 
sub-vocal command. A few miles 
away, a relay clicked in Glory B s 
computers. Silent engines whined 
into life. And at the same time, 
alarms hooted and moaned across 
the field and bright beams stabbed 
angrily into the sky. 

Glory B rose swiftly from the 
spaceport in a low, ground-hug- 
ging curve, homing in on Klay- 
welder. For a moment blue strings 
of heat spat at her from the field. 
They halted abruptly. At that an- 
gle, Frank would soon have been 
sizzling the roofs off Pharalell 
homes and buildings. 

Klaywelder grinned. The ship 
streaked over the outskirts of 
Ochassh and came to a hovering 
stop three feet above him. He let 
the grav unit lift Shastalian into 
the port, then pulled himself up. 
The port snapped shut and Klay- 
welder bounded to the control cab- 
in. He threw himself into the com- 
mand seat and slapped one hand 

GRANDFATHER PELTS 



full across the board. 

Glory B lunged upward in teeth- 
shattering acceleration. Blue fire 
spiderwebbed against the hull for 
a brief moment. Then Pharalell IV 
shrank to a bright green globe 
against blackness. 

F EDERATION ships would al- 
ready be on Red Alert— but 
space was terrifyingly vast and the 
patrols were spread pitifuly thin. 
He would be long gone when they 
finally got to where he was sup- 
posed to be. A quick stop on Filo 
to open the scrambled hold, then 
a first-class plastjob for himself — 
a good one, this time, from eyes 
to toes — and then Earth. 

He broke out his last sixteen- 
ounce steak from the locker and 
topped it with a bottle of Pharalel- 
lian wine. In comfortable lethargy 
he strolled toward his quarters, 
stopping by the entry port to gaze 
once more at Shastalian. He would 
have liked to have spread the big 
pelt out to its full length but there 
was no place in the ship nearly 
large enough to accommodate the 
great golden fur. 

Stretched out on his bunk, Klay- 
welder thought about Arto Frank 
and grinned tiredly. Poor Arto. 
He was, though, genuinely sorry 
about Garii. Garii was all right. 
He hoped Shastalian’s loss didn’t 
hit him too hard. 

Still, he reasoned with Klay- 
welder logic, Garii had lots of

of his more ingenious tricks — not 
least his magnificent flying spell. 
Purple tries to explain that his 
“magic” (the only word the speak- 
er-spell can find to translate Pur- 
ple’s designation for his tricks) is 
based on the laws of nature and 
that Shoogar must be patient and 
study long and hard in order to 
master such legerdemain. 

Shoogar is not to be appeased 
with that study-now-spell-later 
nonsense. He and Lant go off to 



perform the customary rites pre- 
paratory to invoking powerful 
curses. 

Standing on the banks of the 
pond where the flying nest rests, 
Shoogar casts enough spells to 
destroy the nest and put an end to 
that meddling magician forever. 

Satisfied that he has defended 
his honor, Shoogar turns to see 
Purple standing, unhurt and unim-

VI 



H E STOOD there, his devices 
floating behind. Every eye 
was on him. His hands were on his 
hips as he looked thoughtfully 
down at his nest. How long had 
he been standing there? 

“Fascinating,” he said. And he 
started briskly down the slope. 
His devices followed. 

The nest sat like a great egg in 
the middle of the river. Water 
backed up behind it, flowed in 
great torrents past its bulging 
flank, splashed angrily up and 
over the trampled shore. Angry 
mud creatures clambered over its 
dull black surface, scratching de- 
terminedly at the spell designs. 
Gobbets of mud and bloody fur 
streaked its sides — but still the 
spells of Shoogar were visible, al- 
most arrogantly upright. 

That made me uneasy. My eyes 
searched for the dents in the 
stranger’s ruined nest, the dents 
surely put there by the horns of 
the rams. I couldn’t find them. 

Purple strode straight down the 
slope and into the water. Not a 
droplet of mud stuck to those pe- 
culiar boots of his — in contrast 
to Shoogar’s legs and mine, which 
were mud to the hip. A pair of 
mud-skunks attacked the magi- 
cian as he entered the water. Pur- 
ple ignored them and they 
couldn’t seem to get a grip on his 
boots. 

He stood under the bulge of the 

104 



nest and we waited for his scream 
of fury. 

Carefully, with a small, edged 
tool, he began scraping off bits of 
Shoogar’s curse-signs and putting 
them into small transparent con- 
tainers. His mindless speakerspell 
continued to translate his ram- 
blings. 

“Fascinating — the power of 
these fluids-secreted-for-the-con- 
trol-of-bodily-functions is like 
nothing I’ve ever seen before. I 
wonder if these effects could be 
produced artificially?” 

Twice he sniffed at what he had 
scraped off and twice muttered a 
word the speakerspell did not 
translate. When he finished, he 
dipped his hands in the river to 
wash them, incidentally offending 
Filfo-mar, the usually gentle river 
god. 

Purple turned to the door of his 
nest. It was flush with the curved 
wall but outlined in orange to 
make it visible. He punched at a 
square pattern of bumps on the 
nest. The door slid open and Pur- 
ple disappeared inside. 

We waited. Would he continue 
to occupy his nest, living in the 
middle of our defiled river? 

The flying nest hummed and 
rose twenty feet into the air. 

1 screamed with the rest, a 
wordless scream of rage. The nest 
turned in an instant from black 
to silver. It must have become ter- 
ribly slippery, for every particle 
of mud and blood and potion 

IF 




from Shoogar’s spell slid down 
the sides, formed a glob hanging 
from the bottom of the nest, and 
dropped in a lump into the river. 

The nest again turned black. It 
moved horizontally across the 
land and dropped gently to the 
ground— just a few yards west of 
where it had stood an hour ago. 
Only now it rested at the edge of a 
region of churned mud, where the 
rams and mud creatures had 
fought to destroy it. 

I could see Shoogar sag where 
he stood. I feared for my village 
and for Shoogar’s sanity and my 
own. If even Shoogar could not 
defend us from the mad magician 
we were all doomed. 

An angry rumble came from 
the villagers as Purple emerged. 

Purple frowned and said, “I 
wish I knew what’s gotten you 
people so angry.” 

Somebody threw a spear at 
him. 

I couldn’t blame the lad. No 
sound, no pattern of mere words, 
could properly have answered the 
magician. But the young man, 
enraged beyond sanity, had hurled 
his bone spear at the stranger’s 
back — and worst of all, without 
a blessing! 

It sruck Purple hard in the back 
and bounced off to the side with- 
out penetrating. Purple toppled, 
not like a man, but like a statue. 
I had the irrational conviction that 
for a single instant Purple had be- 
come as hard as stone. 



But the instant was over. Im- 
mediately he was climbing to his 
feet. The spear, of course, had 
done no harm at all. One cannot 
attack a magician with an un- 
blessed spear. The boy would have 
to be brought before the Council 
of Elders. 

If the village survived that long. 

T HE suns rose together, the 
blue sun silhouetted off-center 
within the other’s great fuzzy- 
edged and crimson disc. 

I woke at noon. The evacuation 
was already well underway. My 
wives and spratlings had already 
done a good deal of the packing, 
though the fear of disturbing my 
sleep had slowed them somewhat. 
Under my supervision and the 
necessary discipline the rest of the 
preparations progressed quickly. 
Even so, we were very nearly the 
last family to leave the village. 
The lower rim of the red sun was 
already nearing the mountains 
when I dropped behind the pro- 
cession of my wives to tarry at 
Shoogar’s nest. 

Shoogar looked tired but curi- 
ously determined. His eyes were 
alive and dancing and his fingers 
moved with a life of their own, 
weaving spell knots into a leather 
strap. I knew better than to speak 
to him while he was in the midst 
of a duel. 

For though no formal declara- 
tion had yet been made by Purple, 
this was a duel. Perhaps Purple 

105 



THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 




thought that, as long as no duel 
was declared, Shoogar would sit 
peacefully by and allow him to 
continue with his duel-mongering 
actions. 

But I knew Shoogar better than 
that. The fierce glow burning in 
his eyes confirmed what I — and 
all of the rest of the villagers— 
already knew. Shoogar would not 
rest until there was one less ma- 
gician in the village. 

I hurried after my wives. Bur- 
dened as we were, we would be 
traveling well into the night. I had 
even removed the hobbles from 
my women so they could travel 
faster. It would not do to under- 
estimate the seriousness of the 
situation. 

We had reached our destination 
by the time the moons were over- 
head. Most of the families of the 
villagers were settled on the 
steppes to the north, a series of 
long sloping rises that overlooked 
the river and the cluster of giant 
trees that bordered the place we 
had left. 

The encampment was a sprawl- 
ing place of lean-tos and tents, 
smoky campfires and shrill wom- 
en, milling groups of men and 
boys. Already scavengers were 
rooting busily underfoot and even 
before we had selected a campsite 
many of my own spratlings had 
melted away into the bustle. 

Although it was already well 
into the night, few slept. The eerie 
glow df the moons gave us a twi- 

106 



light of neither red nor blue but 
ghostly gray — a strange half-real 
quality for the waiting time before 
the next step of the duel. An al- 
most festive air pervaded the set- 
tlement. 

From somewhere in the bach- 
elor’s section came the brawling 
chant of a game of rolling bones 
and an occasional cry of triumph 
as one of the players scored a par- 
ticularly difficult pass. It does not 
take much to please the lower 
classes. 



A N UNPLEASANT surprise 
awaited us in the morning. 

Hinc and I were standing at the 
edge of the encampment, looking 
down the slope toward the village, 
discussing the forthcoming duel, 
when we heard a distant sound 
like a single 'cough from Elcin’s 
throat. 

We looked down to see a tre- 
mendous plume of black smoke 
wafting through the village tree- 
tops. 

“Look,” said Hinc. “Shoogar 
has started already.” 

“No.” I shook my head. “I 
think he is only warming up. That 
looked like a preparation spell 
more than anything else. Some- 
thing to get the attention of the 
gods.” 

“Pretty fierce attention-getter,” 
noted Hinc. 

I nodded. “It’s going to be a 
pretty fierce duel. I wonder if we 



IF 




should move again? Farther 
back.” 

“If we are not already out of 
range, Lant, we haven’t time to 
get out of range,” said Hinc. 
“Even at a dead run. And even if 
you are right you could never per- 
suade the others. They are too 
tired.” 

He was right, of course, but 
before I could speak we were in- 
terrupted by a crowd of frightened 
women running hysterically 
through the encampment as fast 
as their hobbled legs would carry 
them. They were screaming Pur- 
ple’s name. 

I caught up with and cuffed my 
number-three wife to attention. 

“What is the matter with you?” 

I demanded. 

“It’s the mad magician. He’s 
trying to talk to the women — ” 

“The mad magician — here?” 

“He brought his nest to the 
spring where we wash — and he’s 
trying to talk to us. He wants to 
know why we moved.” 

Had the man no self-respect at 
all? Talking to women? Even from 
the mad magician I found this 
hard to believe. I strode purpose- 
fully through the crowd, now mill- 
ing nervously about, women com- 
forting other hysterical women, 
men interrogating their wives, 
sprats crying for attention. 

As I moved toward the spring 
some of the men caught up with 
and followed along behind me. 
They were muttering nervously. 

THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 



It was as the women had said. 
Purple had brought his nest to a 
spot just above the encampment, 
near the spring the women had 
chosen for washing. The great 
black egg-shape was closed and 
the magician was nowhere to be 
seen. 

The others waited only long 
enough to see that the women had 
spoken the truth. Then they 
turned and fled quickly back to 
the settlement. 

Hinc and I exchanged a word- 
less glance. Why had Purple fol- 
lowed us? Was he fleeing from his 
duel? I had never heard of such a 
thing before. What did he want of 
the villagers? 

I circled the nest warily. It 
looked much as it had on the fear- 
ful night when 'I first saw it. I 
crept closer. There, lightly pressed 
into the dust, were the imprints 
of Purple’s strange shaped boots. 
But where was Purple now? 

Suddenly, that booming hollow 
voice. “Lant — just the person I 
was hoping to see.” 

This was too much for Hinc. 
He turned and disappeared down 
the slope after the others. I ached 
to join him but I had to find out 
what the magician was up to. 

The door to the nest slid open 
and Purple stepped out, his 
strange paunchy shape oddly dis- 
quieting. He had a fearful grin on 
his face and advanced toward me 
as if I were an old friend. His 
speakerspell drifted along behind. 

107 




“Lant,” he said, moving closer. 
“Perhaps you can tell me — why 
have you people moved your vil- 
lage? The other spot was so much 
nicer.” 

I looked at him curiously. 
Could it be that he did not know 
of the duel? Was it possible for 
anyone to be that naive? Well, so 
much the better — his ignorance 
was Shoogar’s asset. I certainly 
would not tell him. Why should 
a layman be concerned with the 
affairs of magicians? I didn’t want 
to get involved. 

“Yes,” I said, “the other spot 
was nicer.” 

“Then why do you not stay 
there?” 

“We hope to return soon,” 1 
said. “After the time of the con- 
junction.” 

I pointed to the sky where the 
suns were setting together. 
Ouells’s blue-white point near the 
bottom of Virn’s crimson disc. 

“Oh, yes,” Purple nodded. 
“Very impressive.” Turning, he 
gazed admiringly at the ground 
behind him, “And it makes the 
shadows very pretty, too.” 

“Very pretty — ” 

I stopped in mid-sentence. 
Sharp and blue the suns were, 
each with a bloody fringe — con- 
stant reminder that the time of 
terror was upon us. Was the man 
fearless or foolish? I shut up. 

“Very pretty,” Purple repeated. 
“Very, very pretty. Well, 1 will 
remain here with you and your 

108 



people. If I can be of any assis- 
tance—” 

Something within me shriveled 
and died. “You— you’re going to 
stay here?” 

“Yes, I think so. I’ll go back 
to the village when you people do. 
This will give me a chance to test 
the mountain area for a day or 
so.” 

“Oh,” I said. 

He seemed to lose interest in 
me then, turned and went back to 
his nest. I waited to see how he 
caused the door to slide open. I 
had been puzzling about it since 
I had first seen him do the trick. 
There was a pattern of bumps in 
the surface of the nest wall. Ap- 
parently this had something to do 
with the opening of the nest, for 
he tapped at these in a quick pre- 
cise pattern. 

I presumed that the pattern 
must have been the spell to open 
the door but he activated it too 
quickly for me to see and mem- 
orize it. He stepped inside. The 
door slid shut and he was gone. 

Dejectedly I trudged back to 
the encampment — or what was 
left of the encampment. 

Already the villagers were flee- 
ing from their makeshift homes. 
Men were hastily packing travel 
kits — women were calling for 
spratlings. Children and dogs ran 
excitedly through the crowd, kick- 
ing up dust, chickens and scav- 
engers. 

Panic-stricken families were al- 

IF 




ready moving across the steppes, 
upslope, downslope, sideways, 
anywhere, just as long as it was 
away from Purple, the magician 
who brought disaster with him. 

My own wives were standing 
about nervously, waiting for me. 
Numbers one and two were trying 
to comfort number three, who 
was most upset. 

“He kept trying to talk to me 
— He kept trying to talk to 
me — ” 

“It wasn’t your fault,’’ I told 
her. “You will not be beaten for 
his trespass. You did right to run.’’ 
My words had an immediate 
calming effect on the distraught 
woman, more so than all the 
stroking and soothing of the other 
two wives, once more proving that 
only a man can know how to han- 
dle the unusual situation. 

“Pick up your packs,’’ I told 
them. “We must be on our way.” 
“On our way?” questioned one. 
“But we just got here.” 

“We must move again,” I said. 
“Before this area is blasted. The 
mad magician’s animal manners 
have blinded you to the true dan- 
ger. Shoogar will follow Purple up 
here. Now pick up your packs or I 
will beat all three of you.” 

They did as I bade them — but 
with no small amount of grum- 
bling. Even though I thought to re- 
move their hobbles so as to speed 
the journey, they grumbled — and 
for once they had cause. For a day 
and a half we had fled the site of 



the coming duel. Purple had easily, 
thoughtlessly nullified that effort 
with only a few moments of flight. 

Within an hour the encampment 
was deserted. As we moved down 
the hill I thought I saw Purple 
moving like a lost soul through the 
hastily erected lean-to shelters. 

VII 

W E were the only family to 
return to the village. Where 
the others had fled I did not know. 
Probably south, away from the 
whole region. They had likely lost 
all interest in watching the duel 
even from a distance. Now they 
wanted only to save their skins. 

We approached the village war- 
ily in the fading daylight. The blue 
sun winked out behind the edge of 
the world, leaving only the great 
bulge of the red. The mists rising 
off the distant swamps took fire 
from the glow. It was as if the 
whole western edge of the world 
were aflame. I could almost smell 
the burning of it, a smell of disas- 
ter on the evening wind. 

I left my wives at the nest and 
headed toward Shoogar’s. As I 
made my way through the village I 
could see the many effects of his 
spellcasting. Here and there some 
of our proudest housetrees lay on 
their sides, as if they had been 
blasted out of the ground by great 
forces. Others seemed to have with- 
ered and died where they stood. 
Here and there a nest lay on the 

109 



THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 




ground, shattered walls laying it 
open to the elements. Everywhere 
were great patches of dying vegeta- 
tion. The scavenger animals were 
gone. There were no sounds of 
nightbirds. Except for my wives, 
myself and, of course, Shoogar, 
the village was empty. And dead. 

Even if Shoogar won the duel 
no one would ever be able to re- 
turn to this village. Nor would 
anyone want to. Its stability had 
been permanently destroyed. 

All was silent and brooding. 

The dead grass crunched under 
my feet as I approached Shoogar’s 
nest. I knocked cautiously on the 
wall. 

When he appeared I gasped in 
horror. Shoogar had gone gray and 
haggard. New circles had appeared 
under his eyes and his skin was dis- 
colored here and there with angry 
red patches as if he had been 
caught too close to one of his own 
spells. 

But what startled me most was 
that Shoogar had shaved off all of 
his fur. He was totally naked and 
hairless — a frightening caricature 
of the mad magician. 

He greeted me with a wan smile, 
grateful for my company. I began 
to lay out the ritual supper for 
him. It is traditional that on the 
night before a duel, the men of the 
village serve a meal of faith to 
their patron warlock. But the oth- 
ers had fled, so that duty had fallen 
on me alone. 

I stood silently by and waited, 

no 



serving him at each gesture or 
grunt. It was not much of a meal 
but it was the best I could prepare 
under such circumstances. Shoo- 
gar seemed not to mind. He ate 
slowly, savoring every bite. He 
looked tired and his hands trem- 
bled as he moved. But he ate heart- 

iiy - 

By the time he laid aside his 
bone food-stabber the red sun had 
long disappeared from the west. 
The moons had not yet appeared. 
He moved slowly. But whether 
from satiation or exhaustion was 
impossible to tell. 

“Where are the others?” he 
asked. 

“They’ve fled.” I explained what 
happened. Shoogar listened care- 
fully, occasionally picking at some 
previously overlooked morsel in 
the bowls before him. 

“I did not expect the stranger to 
move,” he muttered. “It is a bad 
thing — but clever. Now I must al- 
ter my spell to account for this 
new factor. You say he tried to 
talk to the women?” He bit into a 
fruit. 

I nodded. “My number-three 
wife.” 

Shoogar spat out seeds in dis- 
gust. “The man must have no taste. 
If one were going to lower oneself 
to talk to women — one should at 
least choose the woman of a 
worthy rival.” 

“You have no women,” I 
pointed out. 

“It is still an insult to me.” 



IF 




“Perhaps he does not know any 
better. Remember, he said that the 
ways of his homeland are very dif- 
ferent from ours.” 

“Ignorance could be the excuse 
for his bad manners,” Shoogar 
grumbled, “but only madness 
could explain the man’s trespasses 
against common sense.” 



“It is said that a madman pos- 
sesses the strength of ten.” 

Shoogar gave me a look. “I 
know what is said. Most of the 
time it is I who said it first.” 

We sat in silence. 

After a while I asked, “What do 
you think will happen on the mor- 
row?” 




THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 



111 





“There will be a duel. One will 
win, one will lose.” 

“But who?” 

“If it were possible to tell who 
will win — there would be no need 
for duels.” 

Again we sat in silence. This was 
the first time Shoogar had referred 
to the duel with any indication of 
doubt. Always before he had ex- 
pressed confidence in his own abil- 
ities and skepticism for the powers 
of Purple. But now he would not 
even venture to say what the out- 
come of the duel would be. I 
feared for my friend. 

“Lant,” he said abruptly. “I will 
need your help.” 

I looked up startled. “Me? But I 
know nothing of magic. You have 
told me countless times that I am 
a fool. Is it wise to risk such an 
important undertaking in the hands 
of a — ” 

“Shut up, Lant,” he said softly. 
I shut. “All you have to do is help 
me transport my spell-casting 
equipment up the mountain to Pur- 
ple’s nest. We will need two bicy- 
cles or some pack animals. I can- 
not carry it all myself.” 

I breathed easier. “Oh, well, in 
that case — ” 

We were on our way within the 
hour. 

I T WAS close to dawn when we 
reached the site of the encamp- 
ment. The deserted lean-tos and 
shelters stood bleak and empty in 
the night, like some fearful city of 



the dead. I found myself trembling. 

We rode through it wordlessly, 
finally parking our bicycles on the 
slope just below the spring. We 
could hear it babbling carelessly in 
the dark. 

Taking care to keep as quiet as 
possible, we edged forward, up the 
hill. I held my breath till we topped 
the rise, let it out in a whoosh. Yes, 
the nest was still there. 

I believe I would have cried bit- 
ter tears had it been gone. I am 
sure that to have lost his enemy 
would have killed Shoogar. The 
frustration would have been too 
much. 

We crept back to the deserted 
encampment, there to wait the 
coming of dawn. I ached for a 
chance to sleep but Shoogar gave 
me a potion to keep me awake. To 
keep him company, he said. He be- 
gan laying out his equipment, or- 
ganizing and sorting. 

“If I can only take him by sur- 
prise,” he muttered. He paused to 
oil a metal knife. “And if only 
there were some way to draw him 
away from his nest — ” 

“That’s not needed,” I blurted. 
“He will probably leave it by him- 
self. He is testing again. He said 
this when I spoke to him. He wants 
to test the mountain.” 

“This is a bit of good fortune. I 
hope that he tests the mountain the 
same way that he tested the village 
— for when he tested the village he 
was gone from his nest almost the 
entire day.” 



112 



IF 




“What if he doesn’t? What if he 
returns before the curse is fin- 
ished?” 

“Let us hope he does not.” 

“Can’t you do something?” 
Shoogar paused, thought for a 
moment, then rummaged in his kit. 
He produced a small leather pouch 
of dust and another of herbs. 
“Here, go and spread this dust 
around the outside of his nest. It is 
very fine dust; It will float in the 
air for hours. If he breathes any of 
it, it will produce a very strong 
yearning in him. He will not return 
until that yearning is satisfied.” 
“But what about me?” 

‘‘When you finish with the dust 
you will take half of those herbs 
and chew them well. Swallow them 
— when they turn bitter in your 
mouth but not until they turn bit- 
ter. Bring the rest of the herbs 
back to me, so I may chew them. 
They will make us both immune to 
the power of the dust.” 

I nodded, then crept up the hill 
and did as I was instructed. When 
I brought the two leather pouches 
back to Shoogar he was just laying 
out the last of his equipment. One 
swollen pouch he handled most 
carefully. 

“Powdered magician’s hair,” he 
explained. 

I did not blame him for handling 
it carefully. He had sacrificed 
much to produce it — his squat and 
shaven body trembled with the 
cold. 

Abruptly a troubled look 



crossed his face. “I am sure that 
Purple’s power is in some way con- 
nected with his nest. I must get in- 
to it somehow. That is the only 
part of my curse that I am in 
doubt about. I must get into that 
nest.” 

I said, “Today— I mean, yester- 
day (for dawn was fast approach- 
ing) — I was able to get close 
enough to Purple to observe him 
working his doorspell— ” I ex- 
plained I had seen a pattern of 
bumps on the nest wall. Purple had 
tapped at them in a certain way 
and the door had slid open. 

Shoogar listened carefully. “Ob- 
viously the order in which he 
touches the bumps is the way the 
spell is controlled. Think, Lant. 
Which bumps did he touch?” 

“That I did not see.” 

Shoogar cursed, “Then why 
bother to tell me how to open the 
door if you do not know? Lant, 
you are a fool.” 

“I am sorry — but it happened so 
quickly. If I could only remem- 
ber — ” 

“Lant,” Shoogar asked, “have 
you ever been placed under the 
spell of the open mind?” 

I shook my head. 

“It is a spell of great power. It 
can be used to make you remem- 
ber things that you think you have 
forgotten.” 

“Uh, is it dangerous?” 

“No more so than any other 
spell.” 

“Well,” I said, picking up my 

113 



THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 




bicycle. “Good luck with your 
duel, Shoogar. I will see you when 
it is — ” 

“Lant,” he said evenly. “If you 
take one more step downslope I 
will work your name into the curse 
along with Purple’s.” 

I laid the bicycle down again. 

S HOOGAR said, “Don’t be 
fearful. I will do my best to 
protect you. Suddenly you have 
become a very important part of 
this duel. The knowledge locked 
up in your mind may make the dif- 
ference between success and fail- 
ure.” 

“But, Shoogar, I am a fool. 
You have told me that too many 
times for it to be otherwise. I ad- 
mit it. I am a fool. You could not 
be wrong in your judgment of my 
character. What good could I be 
to you?” 

“Lant,” said Shoogar, “you are 
not a fool. Believe me. Sometimes 
in my quickness of temper I have 
made rash statements. But I have 
only the greatest respect for your 
judgement, Lant. You are not a 
fool.” 

“Oh, but I am,” I insisted. 

“You are not,” Shoogar said. 
“Besides, it does not take any 
great mental prowess to remember 
something as simple as you have 
described. Even an idiot such as 
you could do it.” 

“Oh, but I will only be in your 
way, Shoogar. Please let me return 
to my family — ” 

114 



“And have the other men of the 
village think you a coward?” 

“It would be small burden to 
bear — ” 

Shoogar snapped, “No friend of 
mine shall wear the brand of cow- 
ard. You will stay here with me, 
Lant. And you should be grateful 
that I care so much for you as a 
friend.” 

He turned again to the equip- 
ment laid out upon the ground. I 
sighed in resignation and sat down 
to wait. Dawn was already seeping 
into the east. 

Shoogar turned back to me. 
“Your part in this will be easy, 
Lant. There is no reason to fear.” 
“But the danger — ” 

“There will be no danger if you 
follow my instructions exactly as I 
give them to you.” 

“I will follow your instructions.” 
“Good. There can be no room 
for error. Even the tiniest mistake 
could cost us both our lives.” 

“But you just said there would 
be no danger.” 

“Not if you follow instructions. 
Most of the hard work has already 
been done. Don’t forget, I had to 
construct the equations — I had to 
prepare the ingredients and stabi- 
lize the symbology necessary to 
make the various incantations and 
potions work. All you have to do 
is help me place them in the proper 
place at the proper time.” 

“I thought all I had to do was 
help you open the nest — ” 

“Of course. But if you are go- 

IF 




ing to be there anyway, you might 
as well help me with the rest.” 

“Oh,” I said. 

“And whatever you do, you 
must not try to speak to me. This 
is very important. When the suns 
rise we shall begin — and once we 
begin I must not be distracted at 
all. Except as is necessary to the 
curse I will not speak. Do you un- 
derstand?” 

I nodded. 

“Good. Now listen. There is one 
more thing. A very important 
thing. It has nothing to do with the 
curse, Lant, but for your own pro- 
tection you must be exceedingly 
careful not to lesnerize.” 

“Lesnerize?” I asked. “What is 
lesnerize?” 

But he did not explain. He 
pointed instead to the east. Day 
had seeped over the hills. Shoogar 
fell to his knees and began chant- 
ing to the suns. 

The curse had begun. 

VIII 

T HE first step was a ritual 
cleansing. Then came the sanc- 
tification, the prayer for forgive- 
ness, to the suns, Ouells and Virn, 
and to the moons, all eleven of 
them — now in the configuration of 
Eccar the Man, who had served 
the gods so well that he had been 
elevated to godhood himself. 

Other prayers were offered to 
the river god, the wind god, the 
gods of violence and magic — and, 
of course, to Elcin, the thunder 



god. We offered sacrifice to all of 
them, and sought their blessings in 
the endeavors to come. We prayed 
that they would blame the stranger 
and not us for the affronts about 
to be done to them. 

Then we cleansed ourselves 
again. 

We gathered up the spellcasting 
equipment and crept up the slope 
to where the mad magician’s nest 
waited. Behind and below us the- 
mist thinned as the two moons 
rose higher. We could see for 
miles. 

We topped the rise slowly. 
Slightly below us, on the other side, 
was the black egg of Purple’s nest, 
waiting grim and brooding in the 
silent morning. It was closed, but 
was it deserted? 

I wanted to ask Shoogar what 
the nest step was, but his last in- 
struction made me fear even to 
breathe without being told. Shoo- 
gar must have sensed my indeci- 
sion. 

He said, “Now we wait.” 

The suns rose higher in the sky. 
The last of the mists disappeared 
from the land. And the egg sat si- 
lent on the steppes. The only sound 
was the gurgling of the spring. 

Abruptly the door of the nest 
slid open and Purple emerged. He 
stretched slowly, took a deep 
breath, let it out with a sigh. I 
wondered if the yearning dust was 
still floating in the air. If so, Pur- 
ple^had just filled his lungs with it. 
He showed no reaction as he 



THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 



115 




closed the door of his nest behind 
him. If the dust was working it was 
very subtle. 

We held our breaths as he began 
to climb up the slope of the hills. 
Shortly he disappeared over the 
top of one and we were alone with 
the nest. Shoogar scrambled eager- 
ly for it. I followed in his wake, 
not quite as eager. 

Shoogar surveyed the nest care- 
fully. He strode around it three 
times, finally coming to a stop in 
front of the oval outline that was 
the door. 

This first important step was the 
crucial one. Shoogar positioned 
me in the exact spot I had occu- 
pied when I saw Purple open his 
nest. Then he began to cast the 
spell of the open mind. He brought 
out a device of glass and held it 
before my eyes, commanding me 
to look into it. 

I WONDERED if the strain of 
the past three days had been 
too much for my friend. I saw no 
answers within the device of glass. 
But I did as he said and looked in- 
to it. He began chanting at me 
softly, slowly, in that deep and 
croaking voice of his. 1 tried to 
concentrate on the sound but the 
crystal thing kept flickering light 
into my eyes. 

Nor could I focus my sight up- 
on the thing. It seemed to fade in 
and out of existence even as Shoo- 
gar held it. I tried to follow where 
it went when it disappeared but 

116 



could not. The sound of his chant- 
ing wove in and out with the 
flashes of light and all of it togeth- 
er seemed to be whirling and twirl- 
ing, churning and turning and. 
the world was. 

Abruptly I was wide awake. 

Nothing had happened. Had the 
spell of the open mind failed? 

It must have. I remembered 
nothing. I opened my mouth to 
speak but Shoogar stopped me. 

“You did fine, Lant. Just fine.” 

I wondered what he was talking 
about but he was once more fuss- 
ing with his equipment. His man- 
ner was confident, almost cheerful. 
He found what he was looking for, 
a piece of chalk, and proceeded to 
draw a rune about the square pat- 
tern of bumps beside the door. 
Only once did he speak to me. 

“You told me almost all of 
what I need to know, Lant. Al- 
most all. The rest I will fathom for 
myself.” 

I shrugged and sat down to 
watch. Obviously he knew what he 
was doing. 

He sat cross-legged before the 
door and began chanting, working 
himself into a trance. He sat mo- 
tionless on that patch of ground 
before the door, the only sounds 
his thin reedy chant and the gush- 
ing of the spring. 

The suns crept up the sky, 
Ouells glowing like a blue-white 
diamond at Virn’s fading edge. So 
much to do, so little time! How 
long would Purple be gone? Could 

IF 




we complete the spell in that time? 

Shoogar sat silent and unmov- 
ing. His eyes were glazed. Occa- 
sionally he would give a little grunt. 

Could Purple throw red fire at a 
man? 

At last, when I had begun to fear 
that Shoogar would never speak 
again, he rose, stepped to that pat- 
tern of bumps and touched four of 
them in a particular pattern. 

Nothing happened. 

Shoogar repeated the touch. 

Still nothing happened. 

Shoogar shrugged and returned 
to his place. Again he went into his 
trance. This time, after an even 
greater wait, he approached that 
door even more cautiously. Once 
more he tapped out a pattern on 
the bumps — the same four, but a 
different order. 

Nothing happened again. 

Shoogar sighed and returned to 
his squatting position. I began to 
fear that we might spend the whole 
day just gaining entry to Purple’s 
nest and have no time left for the 
cursing. Indeed, I had almost given 
up all hope of ever completing the 
task before us when Shoogar rose 
again. He approached the nest 
slowly, looked at the bumps for a 
long time, then touched four of 
them in a carefully precise man- 
ner. 

And the door to the nest slid 
open. 

S HOOGAR allowed himself a 
smile — but only a small one. 



There was still much to do. 

Quickly we gathered up the 
equipment and moved into Pur- 
ple’s nest. 

The walls themselves glowed 
with an odd-colored light— bright 
and yellow, it made my eyes see 
colors that were not there. Slowly, 
as my vision sorted itself out, I be- 
gan to see that this nest was fur- 
nished like no other nest I had ever 
seen. All around were tiny glowing 
eyes, raised knobs and more 
bumps like those in the pattern 
outside the door. 

In the center was a zig-zag piece 
of padded furniture, a fit couch for 
a demon. Set into the nest wall just 
ahead of this were a series of flat 
plates like windows but infinitely 
more transparent — like hardened 
air. Indeed, the whole nest showed 
workmanship finer than I had ever 
seen. 

Shoogar peered carefully at the 
fiat plates like windows. Some 
showed images of the areas around 
the nest. Others held odd patterns 
in colored light, carefully drawn 
lines and curves — obviously the 
demon’s runes. Shoogar indicated 
one of these. 

“Dq you still think he does not 
use magic?” he asked me — then, 
remembering his own injunction 
against unnecessary chatter, si- 
lenced himself. 

Apparently it was not a very 
strong injunction, for Shoogar had 
been muttering back and forth all 
morning. Perhaps he had only 

117 



THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 




warned me against speaking be- 
cause he feared I would distract 
him. Well, he need not have wor- 
ried; I have too much respect for 
Shoogar’s abilities to question him 
in the middle of a spell. I opened 
my mouth to tell him so but he 
cut me off. 

Next to the padded thing was a 
plant, a vegetable well suited for 
the interior of this nest. It, too, 
was of a type I had never seen. It 
was the shape of a white rose but 
its color — the leaves were a bril- 
liant shade of — could such a color 
be green? I could not believe my 
eyes. Green is a dull color, almost 
black; but here it seemed to glow 
as brightly as any shade of red or 
blue. I touched the plant, expecting 
it to be as delicate as any I was 
familiar with; but here too I re- 
ceived a shock, for the leaves were 
as stiff and hard as an uncured 
hide. What a strange world Purple 
must come from, I found myself 
thinking — abruptly, realized that I 
had fallen into a trap. Obviously 
this was some plant that ordinarily 
would have been familiar to me. 
Purple had simply cursed it. 

I turned my attention away, be- 
gan to look for a door leading to 
the area above. There was none. 
Apparently the nest included only 
this one compartment. The rest of 
its huge interior must be all spell 
devices. Shoogar had been right all 
along. 

Shoogar had spread his travel 
kit and his equipment on the floor 

118 



and was methodically organizing 
the materials he would use first. It 
was as if he cursed flying nests 
every day. Abruptly he paused, put 
a finger into the stubble on his chin 
and scratched. He began to exam- 
ine a piece of parchment he took 
from his cloak — a checklist. 

“Yes,” he decided after a brief 
pause. He pulled out the metal 
knife that I had seen before. “We 
will begin by defiling the metal.” 

He spat on the knife, then began 
to carve runes into the surface of 
the floor. Or tried to. The knife 
would not penetrate. Frowning, 
Shoogar pressed harder. The tip of 
the knife broke. Then the blade 
snapped in half. 

Shoogar returned the pieces of 
the knife to his travel kit without 
comment and looked at his check- 
list again. This time he pulled out 
a pouch of reddish powder, ’the 
dust of rust. He emptied a bit of it 
into his hands and blew. A smoky 
red cloud filled the room. I 
coughed and he threw me an angry 
glance. 

A whirring sound started some- 
where. Then a wind blew through 
the nest, plucking at my hair and 
clothing. I looked around in fear — 
could Purple have trapped the wind 
god? Even as I looked for traces of 
such a thing, the reddish dust in 
the air thinned. Shortly the wind 
stopped, and the dust was gone 
with it. There was not even a fine 
red layer on any of the polished 
surfaces. Odd. 



IF 




Still Shoogar was undismayed. 
He consulted his list again. 

Abruptly he produced a ball of 
fire from under his robe. Then an- 
other and another, throwing them. 
They struck the interior of the 
nest, sending up acrid sparks and 
oily smoke. 

T HERE was a hissing sound — 
and jets of water spat from 
apertures in the ceiling. They 
aimed themselves straight at the 
fireballs, drenched them to ash in 
seconds. And then, as Shoogar 
produced a last fireball from un- 
der his robe, they all turned on 
Shoogar. 

When the water went off Shoo- 
gar turned his hand over and al- 
lowed the drenched fireball to drop 
stickily to the floor. Dripping, he 
held up his sodden checklist and 
consulted it again. Water dripped 
from it onto the floor, then 
drained away into places we knew 
not. 

1 felt my hopes draining away 
with the water. Shoogar had begun 
three separate attempts — and all 
of them had failed. The stranger’s 
magic was much too strong. We 
were doomed even before we had 
begun. 

“Ah, yes--” said Shoogar. “It 
goes well.” 

I doubted my ears. I dared a 
question, “Well?” 

“Obviously, Lant, you have not 
been paying attention. The nest is 
equipped with very efficient protec- 



tive spells. I had to find out what 
they were, so that I could nullify 
them. Now let us curse.” 

Shoogar began by inscribing 
runes on all the surfaces of the 
nest, floors, walls ceiling, the back 
of the oddly shaped couch, the 
panels of knobs, everything. He 
called upon Fineline, the god of 
engineers and architects, to blast 
this nest with a spell of deformity 
to make it crack and shatter. 

Onto each of the sacred signs, 
inscribed with chalk instead of 
knife, he dripped small portions of 
several different potions. As they 
combined they began to smoke 
and sputter. “Waters of fire, burn 
and boil,” Shoogar urged them. 
We watched as the fluid ate holes 
into the runes and surface below. 

Beautiful. Blasphemy is the 
heart of a good curse. 

Next he began to fill the ship 
with dust. Apparently he wanted to 
overload the spell of the protective 
wind, for he blew great clouds of 
the red dust of rust. The whirring 
started up immediately but Shoo- 
gar kept blowing. 

“Well, don’t just stand there, 
you goat — help me.” 

With my help we were able to 
keep great swirling clouds of rust 
swirling and churning throughout 
the entire compartment. The dust 
of rust is a symbol of time, sacred 
to several gods at once: Brad of 
the past, Kronk of the future and 
Po who causes the decay of all 
things. 



THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN

When we had run out of the dust 
of rust, Shoogar continued with a 
fine white powder. It looked like 
the grindings of bone. 

“Aim for those wind pockets,” 
said Shoogar, pointing at a square, 
screened-over opening. 

Eyes streaming, coughing vig- 
orously, I did so. Once Shoogar 
hurled a fireball at the screen, 
where it stuck. Water jetted brief- 
ly, splashing through the screen. 
Some of the grindings gathered 
around the water droplets. Pres- 
ently the whirring became uneven, 
threatened to stop. 

“Cover your nose and mouth, 
Lant. I do not want you to breathe 
any of this.” He pulled out ^a fat 
leather pouch. I put a cloth across 
the lower half of my face and 
watched as he produced a thick 
double handful of powdered magi- 
cian’s hair. 

With a care bom of great sacri- 
fice he aimed cautiously and blew 
a great sneeze of it toward the 
wind pockets. Within a moment, it 
was gone. 

The whirring sound labored — 
the wind seemed to be dying. Sud- 
denly both stopped. 

“Good, Lant. Now get the 
pots.” Shoogar was beaming with 
triumph. I pulled my kit from its 
place by the wall and produced a 
collection of six pottery contain- 
ers, each with a close-fitting lid. 

“Good,” said Shoogar again. 
He began to place them carefully 
around the interior of Purple’s 

120 



nest. Into each he put a sputtering 
ball of fire, then closed the lid on 
it. 

There were tiny holes in the lid 
of each pot — to allow the fire-god 
to breathe but too tiny to allow 
entrance of the water. The liquid 
jets arched out but, unable to 
reach the flames directly, they con- 
tinued playing over the pots and 
over everything else. 

Shoogar watched to see where 
the water was draining, began 
pouring defiled water and other 
viscous syrups into the drain holes. 
Once he paused to add a generous 
handful of the white dust bone 
grindings. As it swirled down into 
the drain, the mixture seemed to 
thicken ominously. 

Shortly it seemed as if the drains 
were not working as efficiently as 
they had at Tirst. The water was 
gathering in pools on the floor. 
The odious smell of the defiled 
water mixed with the hot, steamy, 
smoky air. I thought I would 
retch. But no matter, the defiled 
water would certainly anger Filfo- 
mar, the river god. 

By now, Filfo-mar and N’veen, 
the god of the tides would be en- 
gaged in their ancient tug-of-war. 
Only this time they would be tug- 
ging not at the waters of the world, 
but at opposite sides of the black 
nest. The more water that poured 
into the cabin, the stronger grew 
their powers — and the more vi- 
cious their battle. 

By the time the water jets 

IF 




stopped hissing, we were several 
inches deep in water and Shoogar 
and I were both dripping wet. But 
not chilly. The nest was steaming 
hot and growing hotter. Shoogar 
shucked off his robe and I followed 
suit. 

My eyes were watering and 1 
was still coughing up dust from 
my lungs. I pointed this out to 
Shoogar. 

He said, “Stop complaining. No- 
body ever said a curse was easy. 
There’s more to come yet.” 

Indeed, we had only begun. 

Now Shoogar turned his atten- 
tion to the various panels and 
plates that lined the interior. There 
were a great many knobs and 
bumps. Many of these came in sets 
of eight, each labeled with a differ- 
ent symbol. One we recognized — a 
triangle, the symbol of Eccar the 
Man. 

Could it be that some of Pur- 
ple’s spells were based on the sym- 
bol of Eccar? If that were so, 
could Shoogar use that fact as a 
wedge, his lever with which to un- 
balance the rest of the spells of 
Purple’s nest? 

Shoogar pursed his lips thought- 
fully, scratched at his stubbly chin. 
“Push the bumps, Lant. Wherever 
you see the symbol of the triangle, 
push the bumps — we will activate 
all of Purple’s Eccar spells and dis- 
sipate their power.’’ 

W E MOVED through that 
compartment, looking high 



and low for the knobs and bumps. 
The knobs could all be twisted so 
that the triangle would appear at 
the top and the bumps could all be 
depressed. There were blank knobs 
also — with a little experimentation 
Shoogar found that these could be 
turned in such a way that tiny sliv- 
ers of metal behind layers of glass 
would move and point to triangles 
etched there. 

Several times strange things- 
happened, but Shoogar cautioned 
me to ignore them. Once, one of 
the flat mirror-like plates glowed 
with an unearthly light and images 
appeared on it— images of the vil- 
lage, images of people we knew, 
images of Hinc and Ang and Pilg. 

I stared in fascinated horror — and 
then Shoogar nullified the spell by 
painting over it with a thick gray 
potion that obscured the image en- 
tirely. 

“I told you not to look,’’ he re- 
proved me. 

We continued. Eventually we 
had turned every device in that nest 
to the symbol of the triangle. 

We began the next phase of the 
curse. 

The pots had begun to cool, so 
Shoogar replenished them. Al- 
ready the metal where they sat was 
too hot to touch, and portions of 
other devices had begun to crack. 

Now Shoogar began painting his 
thick gray paint over everything. 
First he nullified all the image win- 
dows. Then he painted all of the 
dials over- and all of the bumps. 

IF 



122 




Only the gods would know what 
symbols had been activated. In al- 
most no time the interior of that 
nest was entirely gray. Klarther, 
the god of the skies and seas, 
would be furious. Fol, the god of 
distortion, would be chortling. 
Thus had Shoogar brought them 
to battle with each other over the 
black nest. 

Shoogar began to sketch new 
runes into the painted surfaces, ob- 
livious of their relation to the 
runes beneath. Where the upper 
and under surface conflicted the 
gods would engage in random bat- 
tle. Always, when he could, Shoo- 
gar worked the name of Elcin, the 
thunder god, into the runes. 

Into a crevice between two of 
the surfaces of knobs and bumps, 
Shoogar pushed the narrow point 
of a sword-wand* and called on 
Pulfnissin, the god of duels. Call- 
ing on Hitch, the god of birds, he 
broke eggs into three apertures. 
They sizzled angrily where they 
slid down — for Shoogar was using 
the egg-shape image of the nest 
against itself. He continued chant- 
ing, calling on Musk-Watz and 
Blok, the god of violence; and at 
one point he even cast a rune defil- 
ing Tis’turzhin, the god of love, 
for love turned to hate can be the 
mightiest force of all. 

Shoogar consulted his checklist 
again and produced a container of 
dormant sting things and another 
of fungusoids and leeches. He 
brought forth things with barbs 



and things with claws and began 
scattering them about. Torpid 
though they were, some tried to at- 
tack us; but we were careful to 
place them where they were not 
immediately dangerous. And we 
had had the forethought to wear 
our thickest boots and gloves — 
the fanged creatures could not cut 
through. 

As he called on Sp’nee, ruler of 
slime, Shoogar spread great vis- 
cous gobs of goo into cracks and 
crannies between the boards of 
knobs and bumps. The air was al- 
ready unbreathable with heat and 
damp but the boards were far hot- 
ter. In places Shoogar’s gray oint- 
ment had blackened and cracked. 
The surface beneath glowed red 
with heat and gave forth a stench 
that one could hardly bear. Eggs 
sizzled and smoked in places we 
could not see. 

And always Shoogar continued 
to call upon Elcin. The God of 
Thunder. The God of Fear. 

“Elcin, oh, Elcin! Come down, 
oh, great and tiny God of light- 
ning and loud noises! Come down 
from your mountain, oh, Elcin. 
Come down from your mountain 
and strike down this infidel who 
dares to profame the sacred name 
of your magic.” 

It seemed as if we had been 
working for days. Shoogar con- 
tinued to hang his webs of pain and 
to paint his runes of despair. 

The swimming, heated compart- 
ment crawled with fuzz balls and 



THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN

stingers, crabs and krakens and 
leeches. Somewhere something was 
burning and oily smoke seeped up 
the walls. 1 choked on the rotting 
air and blinked the tears from my 
eyes. 

It was a masterpiece. 

IX 

I FOLLOWED Shoogar out of 
the nest eagerly. The dry grass 
crunched under my feet as I 
dropped to the ground. It seemed 
as if we had spent days in that 
Shoogar-generated hell. 

I was amazed to find that it was 
still day. The double sunlight 
washed the world with a reassuring 
familiarity. The trees and plants 
and grass still had their familiar 
dull black hues. 

My head swam in the cool clear 
air — waves of dizziness swept over 
me. Even so, it was I who had to 
help Shoogar to walk. I had only 
observed the curse. Shoogar had 
executed it and it had taken its toll 
of his strength. We moved uneven- 
ly down the slope. Our shadows 
wavered before us, fringed with 
red and blue edges. As the curse 
had ended, so had the conjunction. 
Once more the suns were separate. 

It seemed a miracle that Purple 
had not interrupted us but it was 
still only mid-afternoon. We had 
finished with time to spare. 

We collapsed behind a clump of 
bushes. The unfouled air was like 
strong quaff and I was drunk on it. 

124 



We lay under the familiar black 
leaves, taking deep heaving breaths. 

After a while I rolled over on 
my side and looked at Shoogar, 
“When does it begin?” 

He didn’t answer and for a mo- 
ment I thought he had fallen 
asleep. It would not have surprised 
me. The exertions of the past days 
had left him pale and haggard. His 
eyes were red and rimmed with 
deep circles when he opened them. 
He sighed. 

“I don’t know, Lant. I don’t 
know . perhaps I forgot some- 
thing.” 

I sat up and looked uneasily at 
the black nest. It waited there in a 
hollow between two hills, its door 
invitingly open. Its door! 

“Shoogar!” I cried. “The door! 
We left it open!” 

He sat up suddenly, stared hor- 
rified across the hill. 

“Can we close it?” I asked. 

“It must need another spell for 
that,” said Shoogar. “And we 
don’t have it.” 

“Couldn’t you — ” 

“Couldn’t I what?” he de- 
manded. “Make up a door-closing 
spell? Not for that nest, I couldn’t. 
I’d have to know what activates 
the door-opening spell first.” 

“But I saw you open the door.” 
“Lant, you are a fool. I know 
how to use the spell- but I do not 
know why it works as it does. You 
saw what trouble I had with the 
light device. No, Lant — unless you 
know something else about the 

IF 




way that door works — and I know 
you don't, for I peered into your 
mind— it's going to stay open.” 

“But the curse — ” 

He cut me off with a gesture. “I 
don't know — it must be waiting. It 
needs something to activate it, 
probably the closing of the door. 
Without that—” He shrugged, let 
the sentence trail off into silence. 

The suns crept westward, the 
blue now visibly ahead of the red. 

I peered uneasily across the hill. 
How long would that curse wait 
before it went bad? Only the gods 
could help us if this, the greatest 
of Shoogar's spells, were to go 
foul — and if it did go foul there 
would be no gods left who could 
help us. They would all be against 
us. 

S LOWLY the shadows length- 
ened — the chill of the dying day 
crept across the world while Shoo- 
gar and I stood helplessly by. The 
black nest waited, grim and forbid- 
ding. Yellow light poured from 
its door. 

The world waited. We waited. 
The nest waited. 

The curse waited. 

And then, abruptly, a sound. 
Footsteps crunching up the side of 
the hill. We dropped down behind 
the bush. 

Purple came into view seconds 
later, striding up over the rise— I 
wondered if he had satisfied his 
yearning —then down the slope to- 
ward his waiting nest. He could 

THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 



not see the open door from his di- 
rection of approach. 

He rounded the curve of the nest 
wall and stopped. Then he stepped 
hurriedly forward and peered with- 
in. For the First time we saw Pur- 
ple react to Shoogar’s magic. He 
screamed like a hunting banshee- 
bat. 

No doubt a translation would 
have been most instructive but the 
speakerspell was silent. Purple 
clambered into the door. The jamb 
caught him across the forehead, 
knocking the glass appurtenances 
from his nose. We heard his voice 
from inside the nest — great an- 
guished cries, hardly recognizable. 

Occasional words would come 
from the speakerspell, booming 
across the hollow: “My god in — 
how did they get in? Stung me! Get 
off my foot, you son of — why isn't 
the pest-killer working?” 

“The sting things are giving him 
trouble,” I whispered. 

“God-damned sting things!” 
Purple’s booming voice corrected 
me. 

“But the sting things are not the 
spell, Lant,” Shoogar hissed. 
“They would sting whether they 
were part of the curse or not.” 

Shoogar was right. The curse 
had not yet been activated. An- 
guished, I tore at my fur. What 
were the gods waiting for? Would 
they wait so long that Purple 
would have time to nullify the ele- 
ments of the spell and turn it back 
on Shoogar? 

125 




More words came hurtling 
across the slope: “Eggs! Eggs?” 

“At least you have ruined his 
composure,” I whispered to Shoo- 
gar. “That’s a beginning.” 

“Not enough. The gods should 
be tripping over each other in their 
eagerness to destroy him. It must 
be the door. It must be! Lant, I 
fear — ” 

His voice stopped. I felt ice 
melting along my spine. 

“Savages — ” Boomed Purple’s 
voice. “Primitive savages. This 
damned gray paint— where the hell 
is the — incest, lovemaking, illegiti- 
mate, compound incest, excrement 
excrement excrement, oral-genital 
contact, rectums, castration, dis- 
eases passed by lovemaking, prim- 
itive anal lovechildren! I’ll kill the 
lovemaking offspring of dogs! I’ll 
bum this lovemaking world down 
to bedrock!” 

Purple may have been incoherent 
but he certainly sounded sincere. I 
readied myself to run. I could see 
him moving about within the nest. 
He was stabbing furiously at the 
various bumps and depressions 
that we had painted over. Savagely 
Purple twisted the knobs, one after 
another, attempting to nullify 
Shoogar’s spells. 

“And as for that fur-covered an- 
imal, Shoogar — ” 

The heavy curved door slid shut 
and cut off Purple’s last howl. 

A GENTLE breeze tugged at 
the leaves, the bushes and the 



cuffs of our robes. The shadows 
had lengthened until they stretched 
eastward into darkness. 

The blue sun twinkled and van- 
ished, leaving only the bloated disc 
of the red. Below us the hills lay 
like folds of crumpled red cloth. 
All was deathly silent. 

Slowly Shoogar and I crept out 
of our hiding place. The black nest 
sat quietly in its depression. The 
door, closed now, was only an 
orange oval outlined on its smooth 
featureless surface. 

We edged forward, curiously, 
cautiously. 

“Has it begun yet?” I whispered. 

“Shut up, you fool. Every god 
must be listening.” 

We moved closer. The black egg 
waited, motionless. Shoogar put 
his ear to its surface and listened. 

Abruptly the egg rose noiseless- 
ly into the air, throwing Shoogar 
back. I threw myself flat on the 
ground, began praying for forgive- 
ness. 

“Oh, gods of the world, I cast 
myself upon your mercy. I plead 
to you. Please, do not let me — ” 

“Shut up, Lant. Do you want to 
foul the spell?” 

I lifted my head cautiously. 
Shoogar was standing, hands on 
hips, staring up into the red twi- 
light. The black nest hung unmov- 
ing and patient a few feet above his 
head. 

I climbed wearily to my feet. As 
a curse, this spell was turning out 
to be a dull bore. 



126 



IF 




“What is it doing?” I asked. 

Shoogar didn’t answer. 

Abruptly the nest turned from 
black to silver and began sinking 
back toward the ground as gently 
as it had risen. The red dusk 
glinted across its surface with the 
color of blood. 

We stepped back as it touched 
the ground. It continued sinking 
downward without so much as 
slowing. Now, at last, there was 
sound, a churning crunching mut- 
ter of rock being forced aside. The 
nest moved downward, inexorably. 
The rocks screeched with the 
sound of its passage. 

In moments it was gone. 

The crackle of rock sank to a 
distant mutter, then died away en- 
tirely. Dazed, I walked to the rub- 
bled edge of the hole. Darkness 
swallowed the bottom of it, though 
an occasional distant rumble of 
movement could be felt. 

I became aware of Shoogar 
standing beside me. 

“Brilliant,” I said and I never 
meant anything more. “It’s gone, 
Shoogar. Completely, totally gone. 
Disappeared into the ground. The 
world has swallowed it up as if it 
never existed. And — ” I gasped 
breathlessly — “and there were no 
side effects at all.” 

Shoogar harrumphed modestly. 

He bent to pick up the glass ap- 
purtenances which had fallen from 
Purple’s nose. He pocketed them 
absent-mindedly. 

“It was nothing,” he said. 

THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 



“But, Shoogar — no side effects. 
I wouldn’t have believed you could 
do it — I wouldn’t have believed 
anyone could do it. Why didn’t 
you tell us you were planning this? 
We wouldn’t have had to leave the 
village.” 

“Best to be safe,” Shoogar 
mumbled. He must have been 
dazed by his triumph. “You see, 
I wasn’t sure. What with the tidal 
equations acting to pull the nest 
down instead of — and with Eccar 
the Man tending to — well, it was 
highly unusual — experimental, you 
might say. I — ” 

The whole mountain shook un- 
der us. 

I landed jarringly on my belly, 
looking downslope. Two hundred 
feet below the black nest erupted 
out of the hillside. 

It was screaming with an unholy 
sound. We had hurt it terribly. The 
egg wailed its pain, arising, falling 
note, piercingly loud even as it 
moved away from the mountain. 

Some weird side effect had pul- 
verized the very substance of the 
hill beneath us, turning it to sliding 
dirt and pebbles. The entire slope 
was sliding, shifting, carrying us 
majestically downward. Stunned, 
we made no move to save our- 
selves, nor was there anything we 
could have done had we had the 
presence of mind. We watched the 
black nest. Even as we slid, we 
could see it, a glinting speck of 
red brightness, shrieking into the 
south. 



127 




The sliding mountain came to a 
stop. Whether from caprice or 
Shoogar’s magic, it had not buried 
us. We had been fortunate enough 
to be standing at the top of the af- 
fected area. Now I found myself 
on my belly, deep in soft dirt. 
Shoogar was several yards away. 

1 climbed to my knees. The 
black nest was no more than a dot 
above the horizon — rising and 
dwindling, rising and dwindling. It 
was going almost straight up when 
my eyes lost it. 

I scrambled down the slope to 
Shoogar, each step creating tiny 
echoes of the bigger slide. 

“Is it over?” I asked, helping 
him to his feet. 

Shoogar brushed ineffectually at 
his robe. “I think not.” He peered 
into the south. “There are too 
many gods who have not yet spo- 
ken.” 

We were ankle -deep in the newly 
pulverized dirt and would have to 
walk softly, lest the slope be jarred 
loose again. We began to work 
our way down cautiously. 

“How long must we wait for the 
curse to complete its workings?” I 
asked. 

Shoogar shrugged. “I cannot 
guess. We called heavily on many 
gods. Lant, I suggest you return 
to the village now. Your wives and 
children will be waiting.” 

“I would stay here with you un- 
til the curse is complete.” 

Shoogar frowned thoughtfully. 

“Lant, the black nest will prob- 



ahly return to attack the one who 
injured it. I dare not return to the 
village until that danger is past — 
and I would not want you here 
with me when that happens.” He 
put his hand on my shoulder, 
“Thank you, Lant. I appreciate all 
you have done. Now — go.” 

I nodded. I did not want to leave 
him. But I knew that this had to 
be. Shoogar was not just saying 
good night; he was saying good- 
bye. Until he knew for sure that 
the black nest had been destroyed 
he could not return. 

Dejectedly I turned and trudged 
down the slope. I did not want him 
to see the tears welling in my eyes. 

X 

The village was as I had left it. 
Silent, deserted and bearing the 
scars of Shoogar’s preparations. 

I had been fortunate to find one 
of my bicycles halfway down the 
hill. Now I parked it beneath my 
own nest. Miraculously, both bicy- 
cle and nest were undamaged. 

My number-one wife was curled 
up on the floor, sleeping, when I 
hoisted myself into the nest. She 
awoke at the swaying of the struc- 
ture and rubbed the sleep from her 
eyes. 

“Where are the others?” I asked. 
“Two and Three and the sprat- 
lings?” 

She shook her head. “They fled 
when Purple came to the village 
this morning.” 



128 



IF 




I was aghast. 

“Purple came to the village?” 

She nodded. 

1 seized her by the shoulders. 
“You must tell me what he did. 
Did he curse Shoogar’s nest? Did 
he—” 

“No, it was nothing like that. 
He just walked around for a 
while.” 

“The fire device? Did he use the 
fire device?” 

“No. He wanted something 
else.” 

“What was it, woman?” 

“I cannot say if I understood 
right, my husband. He did not have 
his speakerspell with him. We had 
to use gestures.” 

“Well, what did he want?” 

“He wanted to do the family- 
making thing. I think.” 

“And you let him?” 

She lowered her eyes. “I thought 
it would help Shoogar’s part of the 
duel if -the mad magician were dis- 
tracted for a while.” 

“But how could you? He is not 
a guest of ours. I should beat — ” 
“I am sorry, my husband. I 
thought it would help.” She 
cringed before my upraised hand. 
“And you did not beat number 
three when Purple talked to her.” 
She was right. I lowered my 
hand. It would not be fair to beat 
one and not the other. 

“He is built most strangely, my 
husband. He is almost completely 
without hair, except for — ” 



“I do not want to hear about 
it,” I said. “Is that all that you 
did?” 

She nodded. 

“And then he left the village?” 

Again she nodded. 

“He did not touch anything? 
Take anything?” 

She shook her head. 

I breathed a sigh of relief. 

“Thank the gods for small fa- 
vors. The situation could have 
been very bad. Fortunately you 
say nothing was damaged.” Grate- 
fully I lowered myself to the floor. 
I had not realized how weary I 
was. “You may serve me a meal.” 

She did so, wordlessly. I had 
taken two bites when abruptly 
from overhead came a weird kind 
of shrieking whistle. 

It was a sound of disaster, of 
emergency and panic. I dropped 
out of the nest and ran for the 
clearing. Through the treetops I 
could see — 

The flying nest! It had returned 
to the village. It was no longer sil- 
ver. Now, it was yellow with heat. 
It hurtled across the sky, circled 
and returned for another shriek’ing 
pass. 

Shoogar’s words flashed across 
my mind. 

... the black nest will probably 
return to attack the one who in- 
jured it . 

Could the nest have confused 
me with Shoogar? I stood in the 
central clearing, too panicked to 
move. 



THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 



129 




It stopped jarringly a few yards 
above the treetops, as if it had hit 
a soft wall. Its door was missing, 
ripped away. The opening showed 
black against the orange glow of 
what could only be super-heated 
metal. 

The empty opening turned, 
questing. I imagined eyes in the 
blackness behind the doorway. I 
waited for them to find me. 

The nest turned faster. 

Suddenly it was spinning. All de- 
tails blurred and vanished — the 
surface seemed a liquid red-orange. 
I heard the drone of it rising and I 
covered my ears. A wind swept 
through the trees. 

As it spun the nest was carrying 
the air with it. Great gusts rushed 
through the village with a rising 
shriek, different from the agony- 
shriek of the nest but terrifying all 
the same. A great whirlpool of 
wind formed the nest at its center. 
I clung to the trunk of one of the 
nearby house-trees. 

Was Musk-Watz attacking the 
stranger’s nest? Or was the nest at- 
tacking the village? The wind 
roared through the trees, through 
the leaves and branches and nests 
— it tried to pluck me from where 
I clung tightly to one of the root- 
limbs. I wrapped my arms and legs 
about the branch and buried my 
face in the bark. Leaves, bark, bits 
of wood sprayed me. It went on 
and on and on. 

After a while I became aware 
that the sound was lessening. I 

130 



raised my head. The wind was dy- 
ing. 

Not a tree in the village carried 
a leaf. Every nest had been 
knocked to the ground. Many had 
been shattered against the trunks 
of their host-trees. Others lay 
yards from where they should have 
fallen. 

P URPLE’S great black egg, still 
spinning, had moved southward 
toward the river. It was above the 
new course of the rushing waters 
when it began to drop. Filfo-mar, 
angry and implacable, was pulling 
the black nest down to destruction. 

I had to see. I followed the nest, 
unmindful of possible danger. I 
had to know if Purple’s nest was 
truly being destroyed. 

The nest was spinning ferocious- 
ly, as if it were trying to escape the 
power of the' river god. When it 
touched the water a great cloud of 
steam burst into the air. At the 
same time the river and its muddy 
banks all rose up in one huge wave 
of earth and water. It blackened 
the sky, covered the moons — I 
tried to run — it splashed across 
the world in one vast wave. A 
scream forced itself out of my 
throat as the rushing water swept 
me back through the village. Filth 
and mud flooded my mouth, my 
nostrils. 

Abruptly I was struck a jarring 
blow from behind, found myself 
caught between two limbs of a 
tree. Water rained down in fat 



IF 




drops and mud in stinging gobs. 

The water began to recede, flow- 
ing back toward the river in a 
great mud-streaking wave. Churn- 
ing debris was left in its wake. 

Shoogar had miscalculated. The 
nest had not returned to attack 
him. Even now I could see that of 
the village nothing was left. Just a 
few blackened trees, naked against 
the night. 

I lowered myself from the 
branch. My back twinged warning- 
ly and I wondered if I had cracked 
a rib. I limped toward the river. If 
I were destined to die I would first 
know the fate of my enemy. 

Black mud squelched beneath 
my feet as I plodded. The bare 
trees dripped muddy goo. It was as 
if the whole world were uninhabit- 
able, drowned in a rain of earth 
and water. It was tricky going — of- 
ten the viscous mess beneath my 
feet hid shards of debris. I was 
lucky not to have slashed open my 
foot. I slipped and fell several 
times. Here and there fish or mud 
creatures flopped in dying agony. 

Under the shadowless light of 
seven of the moons, I began to 
cross the old course of the river. 
The mud and the smooth wet 
rocks all worked to slow me. Prob- 
ably they saved my life. I had for- 
gotten that one god had not yet 
spoken. 

I cursed as I balanced on the 
slippery surfaces. The nest lay 
ahead. In its spinning, it had 
churned a great dish-shaped cavity 



for itself. As I topped the lip of 
that cavity, I saw the nest, black 
again and lying in shallow silvery 
water. Its spin had stopped and — 
finally, finally — it was no longer 
upright. 

It rested on its side with water 
pouring into the hollow around it, 
flooding into the doorway. Garish 
light reflected in that opening and 
across the surface of the water. 

No doubt that final tilt of the 
egg was the work of the god of 
engineers. Perhaps in his last mo- 
ments Purple had finally believed 
in the power of Shoogar’s magic. 
I worked my way closer, eyes open 
for one glimpse of the mad magi- 
cian’s body. Nothing could be left 
alive within that nest. 

I was not one quarter of the way 
down when the interior of the nest 
began to sparkle and flash. This 
was not the steady yellow which 
had lit the compartment earlier. 
This was a sick, sputtering sparkle, 
the color of lightning. I paused, 
unsure. The sparkling grew more 
intense. I could hear crackling 
sounds and the hiss of water turn- 
ing to steam. I began to inch my 
way back up the mud slope. The 
nest was still dangerously alive. 

The blue flashing grew brighter 
behind me — and then a thick puff 
of black smoke erupted from the 
gaping door. I reached the mud lip 
of the chumed-out saucer none too 
soon and dropped behind it. Cau- 
tiously I raised my head. 

The nest was making great 

131 



THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 




flushing sounds. Water jetted from 
holes in its sides but more water 
poured into the open door. Soon I 
noticed something else. It was be- 
ginning to glow again. Dull red, 
bright yellow, incandescent white. 
Waves of heat rolled outward. 1 
had to keep ducking down behind 
the lip of the bowl. Mud boiled 
around the nest. 

Purple’s egg rotated itself up- 
right — and sank. 

It sank ponderously and majes- 
tically into water obviously too 
shallow for it. The water closed 
over it, boiling. Great angry bursts 
of steam came exploding up 
through the bubbling water. Light 
showed through the steam, dim- 
ming, brightening. 

The nest seemed to pause, as if 
wondering what to do next. 

It decided. 

I T LEAPED upward — up and 
out of the pond. It rose in a 
steep arc, glowing white, paused at 
the apex and fell back. It landed 
right in the middle of the village. 
Instantly it bounced, leaving a 
clutch of burning trees behind it. 
A hot wind fanned my face. 

The nest had forgotten how to 
fly. Now it moved by bouncing and 
it glowed with a terrible heat. Each 
time it struck it would give off an 
enormous spark and the land 
would bum. But only momentarily 
— the village was too much a 
swamp to support a fire. 

And still the nest was bouncing. 



As it left the village, other patches 
of flame were spreading. They led 
in a straight line toward the moun- 
tains where Shoogar waited. 

The nest bounced uphill like a 
ball in reverse. I could see it, a 
glowing white speck moving errat- 
ically up the mountainside. Ulti- 
mately it disappeared behind a 
ridge. 

The wind followed it, crackling 
with the presence of the one god 
who had not yet spoken — then it, 
too, faded. A semblance of calm 
crept over the landscape, the only 
sound the dripping of the water 
from the trees, the branches. 

I stood up and looked off across 
the black mud to where a pillar of 
greasy smoke still rose from the 
center of the village. Brushing at 
the mud which permeated my 
clothing, I wondered if my first 
wife had survived. I would regret it 
very much if she had not. She was 
a good woman, obedient and al- 
most as strong as a pack animal. 

It occurred to me then which 
god had not yet spoken. 

I sat down. 

There was a slow and deathly si- 
lence now. Only the crackle of the 
mud, the hiss of water trickling in- 
to pits of melted rock disturbed 
the night. The wind died to nothing. 
The last of the moons was drop- 
ping toward the west. Darkness 
would soon be creeping across the 
land. It would not be safe to be 
about. 

Could Shoogar have been mis- 



132 




taken in this one aspect? After all, i 
He was an unpredictable god, * 
known to have fits of pique — and e 
yet, also known to have failed s 
when most expected to perform, t 
Perhaps the experimental nature of f 
Shoogar’s spell had not been ( 
enough to arouse him. t 

Behind me the sky began to hint 
at deep blue instead of black. I 
stood, cursing the stiff cold weight 1 

off my clothes. J 

An eye-searing flash of light i 

filled the entire world. 

My eyes clenched in pain. But in 1 
the after-image, burned into my 
skull, I saw a great ball of fire, 
like one of Shoogar’s but magni- i 
fied to the size of a mountain. 
Then my eyes could open, and I c 
saw a great rising mass of flaming 
cloud, a toadstool of red-lit fury— > 
fiery smoke standing up behind 
the mountains, reaching, ever- s 
reaching into the sky. 1 

I was slammed backward, t 
slapped rolling across the mud as 
if struck by a giant sledgehammer t 
made of air. And the sound — oh, 
the sound — my ears seemed to cry z 
with the pain of a sound so great. 5 
The sound of Musk-Watz earli- 
er sweeping through the village had 
been only a whisper compared to < 
this. It was as if Ouells himself i 
had come to ground and clapped 
his mighty hands together. In the I 
sudden howling wind, the clapping i 
sound mutated into a continuous i 
rumbling thunder that rolled up < 
and down the hills. It grumbled and \

rumbled, grumbled and rumbled 
across the world. It echoed and re- 
echoed in a never-ending wave. I’m 
sure I continued to hear it long af- 
ter it had actually died away. That 
great bass roar went on and on and 
on. Small rocks began to fall from 
the sky. 

Elcin had spoken. 

I FOUND my wife huddled in 
the crotch of two branches, be- 
neath an uprooted tree. 

“Are you all right?” I asked, 
helping her to her feet. 

She nodded. 

“Good. Then find some bandage 
and tape up my ribs. I am in pain.” 
“Yes, my husband.” She began 
dutifully to tug at her skirt. 

I recognized it as one of her fa- 
vorites. I put out my hand. 

“No. Do not tear that. Find 
something else. That is all you 
have left in the world. Keep it in- 
tact.” 

She looked up at me, grateful 
tears flooding her eyes. 

“Yes, my husband” She paused 
and I knew she wanted to say 
something else but feared. 

“Go on,” I urged. 

She fell to her knees, unmindful 
of the mud, and clasped fiercely at 
my hands. 

“Oh, my husband, I feared so 
for your safety. My heart is filled 
with such gladness at the sight of 
you — I cannot bear it. I could not 
endure the thought of life without 
you.” 



133 




She kissed my hands, buried her 
face against my waist. I stroked 
the fur on the top of her head, 
mud-smeared though it was. It did 
not matter — we were both soaked 
through. 

“It’s all right,” I murmured gen- 
tly. 

“Oh, tell me it is, tell me. Tell 
me that the danger is over, that all 
is right with the world again.” 

“Stand up, woman,” I said. She 
did. “I have lost everything. My 
nest is gone and my tree has been 
uprooted. I know not where any of 
my children are, nor where my 
other wives have fled. I have noth- 
ing. Only the clothes I am wear- 
ing. But I am still not a poor 
man.” 

She looked at me, brown eyes 
wide with wonder. 

“No, I am not. I still have one 
woman, a good woman.” I looked 
into her eyes, wide and glowing 
with love. “A woman with a strong 
back and a willingness to work. 
And it is enough. I can rebuild. 
Now, go and find that bandage. 
My ribs ache with the pain of 
standing.” 

“Oh, yes, my husband. Yes.” 
She began moving cautiously 
across the mud covered landscape. 
I lowered myself carefully to the 
ground. To rest. To sleep. 

B EFORE leaving the village we 
searched through the mud to 
see if anything of value remained 
intact. We found little. I had hoped 

134 



to recover my bicycle but it had 
been smashed under a falling tree. 
I ached to see that finely carved 
machine crushed to sodden pulp. 
Truly, I had been right when I had 
said that we had nothing but the 
clothes on our backs. 

We stood in the ruins of the vil- 
lage and surveyed the disaster. 

“What will we do, my husband?” 

“We will move on,” I said to 
her. “There is nothing left for us 
here.” I turned and looked at the 
distant green prairie. “There.” I 
pointed. “We will go south. Prob- 
ably most of the others will have 
had the same thought.” 

She nodded in acquiescence and 
shouldered her tiny pack. Painfully 
we started the long trek. 

The suns were high in the sky 
when we saw a single tiny figure on 
a bicycle hurrying to catch up to 
us. Something was familiar about 
it — no, it couldn’t be. 

But it was. 

“Shoogar — you’re alive — ” 

He shot me a look, climbed off 
the bicycle. 

“Of course, I’m alive, Lant. 
What did you think?” He paused, 
looked at the dried mud caked on 
our clothes. “What happened to 
you?” 

“We were in the village. We saw 
the end of Purple’s nest. But it 
headed toward the mountains to 
die. We thought that — ” 

“Nonsense, Lant. I won the duel. 
Only the loser gets killed. I saw

mind follow? 




I N THE darkness his thoughts 
ran on, seeming to belong to no 
one, turning back on themselves, 
rubbing against each other, bidding 
him to remember but with no suc- 
cess. 

After only a little while life be- 
gins to accumulate like shellfish 
on a coral reef and a man begins to 
understand that if just one of few 
things were to be taken from him, 
then — he’d have to live with the 
memory, the stain all over his in- 
sides and it would never go away. 
If it happens more than once you 
begin to look for an out — but the 
outs are few and well guarded. 

44 Why doesn’t he wake up , doc- 
tor?” 

If I could die for only a little 
while, he thought. 

44 I wish I knew. Where is the 
mind anyway? Is it just the physi- 
cal, spatial organ called the brain?” 

4 ‘Doctor , you’re not paid to spec- 
ulate.” 

"A patient like this is always a 
slap in the face.” 

44 I’m sorry. Doctor.” 

I’m never going to die, he 
thought. After a little while the 
weight of living breaks you up into 
little pieces that the waves wash 
clean and take back with them into 
the sea. 

My ocean, my wings. For a time 
I lived as a man but I died and my 

136 



corpse lies strangely rotting in the 
hold of a green ship I cannot find. 
Other corpses are there but deter- 
mined to rot no further from their 
present state. 

There is no sun on my ocean, 
only a blue haze and no land of any 
kind. And the sea is filled with 
fleeing fear and rotting plants that 
come up from the shallow bottom. 
Once I saw a giant eel poke its head 
above the warm brine, but I could 
not fear it. My black wings keep 
me safe, he thought. 

Where is my green ship, lost for 
ages now? Racing low over the 
water I sometimes think it is only 
a foot long and I might have 
missed it a thousand times. I open 
my great bill and scoop up the dead 
worms that float near the sur- 
face . 

Once a dripping noise woke me 
in the night. ITell to the floor, into 
the center of the room where the 
pool of stuff had gathered. It was a 
black liquid and when I touched it 
the stuff stuck to my fingers. I 
looked up at the ceiling. There 
didn’t seem to be any more on the 
way. It made me very angry be- 
cause I knew there was more and it 
was holding back just to annoy 
me . 

44 Perhaps he’s trying to get back 
to what happened to him, and when 
he makes his peace with that, may- 
be he’ll waken.” 

44 How long will it take. Doctor?” 

44 For him, probably an epoch — 

IF 




and for us there is no way to tell. 
Was he a good man?" 

“ He was a good man, Doctor . " 

H E REMEMBERED a voice 
saying, “There are faint red 
stars close to the earth whose pri- 
marily infrared radiations are 
mostly absorbed by our atmos- 
phere. No picture of the universe 
can be complete without them. The 
Farside Lunar radio telescope 
thinks it has located one — and 
only two light-years away. Our 
new stardrive works and this will 
be its third test. Of course you will 
conduct scientific observations, 
take photographs, etc. But if all 
goes well, we will be ready to take 
larger hops out into the galaxy. 
Good luck, gentlemen.” 

The voice did not sound convinc- 
ing, he thought. He could not re : 
member who the speaker had been 
— and where? 

He thought, the universe — all 
space — consists of the convolu- 
tions of some monstrous brain and 
I a phantom am set adrift in its 
passages. Strange thoughts drift 
within me, whispering that I am a 
dream. And at the moment when I 
am closest to the truth darkness 
veils everything from me. Speak, 
memory, he commanded but the 
darkness was again complete, in- 
scrutable. 

Suddenly there were stars in the 
darkness, cold unblinking stars, a 
billion of them all around him. He 
saw the fused mass of beryllium 



that had once been his ship. The 
ship tumbled and turned endlessly, 
a crumpled toy among the stars 
and he, a pale gray figure, floated 
near the wreck. He saw himself, a 
small suited mannikin with six 
hours of air stored to support its 
organic component. He felt sweat 
running down his back. His face- 
plate was fogged up — the dials on 
the inside of his suit glowed dimly. 
Gradually the faceplate cleared, 
and he estimated that he was or- 
biting his dead ship once every 
minute. 

He remembered the explosion. 
It was still a splotch of light etched 
onto his brain as if he’d been shot 
full in the face with a laser. The 
stardrive generators had gone, a 
one-in-a-million chance. By all the- 
oretical models such an explosion 
would turn local space inside out 
and scatter anything caught in it 
throughout creation, a variable 
scatter across space and time. He 
had been outside taking three-di- 
mensional shots of the dim red star 
when it happened. Suddenly the 
ship had turned blindingly white. 
The camera had been pushed out of 
his grip, the safety line had snapped 
and then a chunk of something had 
hit him in the middle. Maybe he 
had been lucky nothing had pene- 
trated his suit. Impossible to tell 
good from bad, curse from bless- 
ing. Nothing he had ever known, 
guessed or been told was holding 
still. 

He looked at his transmitter 

137 



DARK, DARK, THE DEAD STAR 




dial. It was faithfully sending out 
the distress call — three laser pulses 
into space every five seconds. 

To his right the red star glowed 
dimly. He knew that somewhere 
the star had a dark companion, a 
chunk of dead rock. If he and the 
ship were still anywhere near their 
previous course, they would pass 
very near to it. He knew what it 
would look like. The body would 
reflect almost no light — he would 
notice it only by its capacity to blot 
out the starfields. 

He touched the small control 
box on his left shoulder and the 
small suit jets spun him around 
three hundred and sixty degrees. 
No dark body was anywhere in 
sight. He gave his jets a touch and 
stopped spinning. The stars stilled 
again in his vision. 

Silence, save for the sound of 
breathing, a metronome of rushing 
air keeping time in a timeless place. 
He tapped his helmet with his glove 
It was a relief to hear the contact. 
He looked at his oxygen meter. 
Its glow was dull inside his helmet. 
He had to twist his neck into an 
uncomfortable position to see it 
properly. 

Oxygen: 5 hr. 22 m. 

He closed his eyes and tried to 
control his breathing. He inhaled 
and counted to ten. He might be 
able to add twenty minutes to his 
life this way. But what did it mat- 
ter? They would never find him, a 
tiny fragment among the stars. 

138 



Better to have been in the ship — 
no memories, no waiting, just a 
flash and oblivion. 

Oxygen: 4 hr. 16 m. 

The warm glow of the tranquiliz- 
er surrounded him and he slept. 
The horizon of the alien land in 
front of him was crimson. The 
sands reflected the bursting flames. 
And the tiger. Slowly tracking, 
back and forth. Waiting. For him. 

He awoke remembering. The 
tranquilizer made him sick and he 
vomited a little. The faceplate 
fogged and smeared. He couldn’t 
see the stars. 

His scream hung inside the suit 
and couldn’t get out. He swatted 
at the control box with his glove. 
The wreck receded suddenly and 
he was spinning. Slowly he man- 
aged to control the spin. He took 
another pill. 

He felt the numbness slowly 
spreading through his body. He 
swam, a god in his bath, smiling. 
Control. Sleep. 

He awoke. Ahead of him a great 
mass obscured the stars. It was the 
red star’s planet, a dark wanderer 
waiting for his corpse. He strained 
to see if the dark mass reflected 
any of the red star’s light but there 
was no light, only the dim circular 
outline against the starfield. Once 
this dying star had been strong 
enough to warm whole worlds. He 
turned himself to look at the wreck. 
It was a small, darkly silver patch 
of metal to his right and for an in- 
stant he thought he could reach 

IF 




out and then hold it in his hand. 

Oxygen: 3 hr. 10 m. 

When the wreck suddenly seem- 
ed to be obscuring stars more rap- 
idly he knew that the dark planet 
was pulling them both in. He 
looked at the huge mass, a large 
black circle taking up almost a 
quarter of the sky. It looks like a 
neatly cut hole in space, he thought. 
I’m going to plow right into it and 
then the ship right on top of me. 
If I last long enough to experience 
it. And then he thought he could 
feel his forward motion, as the 
dark body grew larger in front of 
him. He pushed his suit controls 
and made a complete turn for ob- 
servational purposes. At the end of 
his turn he saw the cluster of 
smaller dark bodies, bits of small 
debris circling the dim red sun. 

Oxygen: 2 hr. 2 m. 

The dark mass now covered a 
third of the sky. He looked down 
at a dark floor covered with spark- 
ling diamonds. For a moment he 
thought they would blur into a 
sheet of light, but his eyes focused 
and the diamonds remained dis- 
tinct. A bit of dust scratched across 
his faceplate, a cue that enabled 
him to imagine his terrifying speed. 

Oxygen: 45 m. 

Where had all the time gone? 
Suddenly he had to remember the 
good things in his life. He re- 
membered her cool, smooth skin, 
her warm lips and long black hair. 



He would never kiss her again— 
she would never be open to him, 
quivering with excitement. He 
would never see the child she 
would have. There was no longer a 
future, love, old age, only a lonely 
death in a dark place at the ends 
of the universe. He wouldn’t even 
know if he would hit the dark 
planet or circle it forever. 

Oxygen: 05 m. 

It was getting harder to breathe. 
The dark planet now took up half 
the sky. He had once pressed a 
fly to death with a paperweight. He 
had always known that it would 
get back at him. He looked toward 
his fused ship* It was tumbling 
wildly end over end. A piece broke 
off and passed a dozen feet to his 
right. 

Oxygen — Empty 

The air became heavy and hot 
very suddenly. He turned the cool- 
ing unit to high. At least the bad 
air would be cool for a while. The 
tiger sprang at him from the dune 
and he fired and missed. It tore at 
his chest, opened it and seized his 
heart in its teeth. He screamed and 
watched the cat run off with it, 
chewing as it ran. The sun was hot 
on his open flesh. It burned. Mo- 
mentarily a cool wind blew through 
his open chest. Then the abrasive 
sand got inside and stirred around 
in his lungs, forced its way down 
into his stomach and bowels. It 
ripped through his guts like a ra- 
zor. The musclesin his calves tight-

ened and turned to stone, refusing 
to relax. His arms stiffened and he 
couldn’t move them. A demon 
was walking around in his head, 
beating against his temples, trying 
to get out, reaching down into his 
spine and twisting. Dark, dark, the 
dead star, the demon whispered 
and refused to let him go. 

He felt his eyes bulge out of their 
sockets. Helen! he tried to shout, 
but no sound came from his throat. 
I love you! The thought wouldn’t 
come out of his head. It was stuck 
there, frozen. He had just run out 
of reality, the blank end of a reel 
of tape, all hiss and noise, running 
on into nowhere. He turned his 
radio up full blast. There was noth- 
ing on the wave spectrum but the 
mindless seething between the 
stars. 

“ When the ships lifeboat found 
him he was like this," the doctor 
said. “ And he didn't come out of 
it all during the eight month jour- 
ney home under auxiliary ion pow- 
er. His two crewmates had to feed 
him intravenously and he lost a lot 
of weight." 

B EYOND death was only the 
soft water and he sank into it. 
Liquid rushed about his limbs. It 
flowed through his veins, nourish- 
ing his poisoned body, filling him 
with a great peace. He withdrew in- 
to the silence somewhere near 
oblivion. He thought of the dead 
portions of his body, hair, nails and 

140 



skin, and of how gradually the liv- 
ing slipped into the nonliving. 

“ He's developing a body fever " 
the doctor said as he looked at the 
diagnostic screen. “ We're going to 
have to break it quickly." The 
woman sitting next to the bed 
leaned forward and looked at her 
husband's face. He seemed to be 
sleeping. She looked for some 
change but his face remained a 
mask. 

He was choking in the hot sand. 
Each grain burned him in turn and 
something grasped him by the 
head and twisted him in the sand 
as if he were a stick. The grains 
were abrasive and cut into him like 
broken glass. Suddenly the sand 
became cool and wet, enfolding 
him in its firm, damp comfort. 
Gradually his mind realized what 
had happened — it came to him 
slowly. As a man wakens on a 
spring morning, he saw the way 
back. 

And he knew now that the green 
ship was no more, that the tiger did 
not make off with his heart and he 
knew that somehow he was alive, 
somewhere. He reached out with 
love toward the great mind that 
ruled the cosmos and gave thanks. 

When the fever’s edge softened 
and turned his sickness to sleep he 
dreamed of fair women with gold- 
en hair and small breasts; he saw 
their firm bodies lying upon green 
grass. He slept. 



IF 




“ Doctor , he blinked.” 

At once he knew she was sitting 
next to him. She had called him 
back. The mind is everywhere, he 
thought. The brain lives in a spa- 
tio-temporal realm but the mind 
comes from elsewhere to stay only 
a short while, an exile from a great- 
er community. 

He felt the light coming into his 
closed eyes, felt it moving along 
his optic nerve to his brain — he 
wondered what kind of eye his 
brain must have to interpret such 
a signal? Then he understood that 
the brain’s eye was only a window 
and through that window watched 
the mind’s eye, the final interpret- 
er, the arbiter of meaning. Its way 
was a special way of seeing, the 
way that made sense of everything 
that came through from a hostile 
universe of which it was a part. 

He thought, the mind develops 
its perceptual powers through ex- 
periential analogy with sense, data 
during life. Lacking sense data the 
mind spins out symbolic represen- 
tations of the imperfectly perceived 
events going on around the locus 
of the brain in space. For him the 
Loss of life, of Flelen, would have 
been purposeless and unbearable, 
so, at the stress point where an- 
other man might have given up, 
his mind-matrix had flared up like 
a nova, a quantum jump to an un- 
precedented level of awareness 
and strength. The resulting field 
had enveloped the physical organ 



that was the brain and had pre- 
served it from the decay that 
should have resulted when his oxy- 
gen ran out. This was the life-force 
that guided biological reproduc- 
tion — the mechanism that made 
life immortal while the individuals 
and even species perished; in his 
case it had preserved an individ- 
ual. The force of his life-affirma- 
tion, the horror of death, the force 
of his will, had found for him the 
counter entropic force of all in- 
telligent life and had preserved 
him until the others had found 
him floating in the darkness. 

But the gain was permanent. He 
could see, truly for the first time, 
as no man had seen before. Space 
was no obstacle; he could feel the 
emotions of those around him — 
especially Helen’s. They were as 
prominent as the corona of the sun 
during eclipse; he understood the 
darkness that covered her face. 
Slowly the darkness was passing 
from her face, revealing to him the 
light of her rising hope. 

He knew that this door of per- 
ception would now always be open 
to him. In the darkness of the dead 
star it had given him the meaning 
of his situation through the vision 
of the dreams. My ocean, my 
wings. He knew what they meant. 

With the thought came the full 
realization that he was alive, now 
more than ever. He remembered 
the torment of the ghostly worlds 
and knew that the terrible fear of 
death at the moment when his 

141 



DARK, DARK, THE DEAD STAR 




tanks had run out had driven him 
there — into the arms of sirens. The 
fountain of life behind his dream 
of fair women had saved him and 
he knew what would happen now. 
He knew she was waiting for him 
like a ministering angel, listening 



and watching for a sign of life. An 
angel made for a man. 

“Helen — ” 

He said goodbye to the dark 
worlds within and opened his 
eyes to the bright light of day com- 
ing in through the window. •

ing are a commonplace,” said Dr. 
Czento. “Most are spurious but a 
few are accurate. One such gen- 
uine landing took place on the 
sands of Nahrunu The British ad- 
visor to the Sheikh, a dear friend 
of mine, knew of the Sheikh’s tab- 
let and his claim to the planets. 
Acting with brilliant acuity, he set 
up the Tammuz Society, showed 
the tablet to our Sentient visitors 
and established agreement to the 
validity of our claim. The second 
tablet is our formal contract. 
What could have been a more suit- 
able language than Sumerian?” 

“Are these Sentients simple- 
tons?” I said. “Are they gulled by 
a quaint artifact of ancient times? 
Surely there’s more to your deal 
than that? The dismantling and re- 
placement of Mars, no matter 
what you say, is a treacherous job 
and a potential disaster if the 
slightest error occurs. They failed 
before? Why not now?” 

“They won’t fail,” said Dr. 
Czento. “You’ve no idea how bril- 
liant they are.” 

“And when the effects of the 
substitution begin — with earth- 
quakes, tidal waves and God- 
knows-what — the hullabaloo here 
on Earth will be a fearsome thing. 
Someone will have to placate our 
scientists, our politicians, the great 
masses of people.” 

“The Tammuz Society is made 
up of selected heads of state, No- 



bel laureates and distinguished 
businessmen,” said Dr. Czento. 
“They are men influential in all 
areas of society.” 

“Then that’s what your payment 
is for,” I said. “Not for the 
Shiekh’s tablet.” 

Dr. Czento’s fingers began to 
tremble. 

“Did you kill Pendleton?” 
“You’re as delusional as he 
was,” said Dr. Czento. “He died 
of natural causes. You saw the 
death certificate.” 

“Which you signed.” 

“As a student,” said Dr. Czento, 
“I played around with the proper- 
ties of chloral hydrate. In moder- 
ate amounts it was a useful de- 
pressant of the central nervous 
system, although it caused nausea 
in some patients. I reduced chloral 
hydrate to a new form, almost 
tasteless, colorless and rather de- 
layed in its insidious effects. It is 
a deadly but passionless killer and 
is almost impossible to detect on 
autopsy. I was sorry to be com- 
pelled to offer it to you.” 

“You want me dead?” 

“Very reluctantly,’’ said Dr. 
Czento. “You’ve drunk two glass- 
es of it, so you’re rather pn bor- 
rowed time. I dare say that you’ve 
already lost all sensation in your 
feet. Perhaps, even now, you can’t 
raise your arms.” 

Dr. Czento was s small man in 
his sixties and by no means athlet- 




ic. Still, he was tough and wiry. 
But for some reason, after 1 got 
up and took violent hold of him, 
he offered little resistance. His 
eyes were wide and unbelieving all 
through the time I bound and 
gagged him. There was the same 
stunned look on his face as I tele- 
phoned to London and asked for 



a National Security officer to 
come out at once. 

1 was terribly relieved when he 
finally arrived, almost two hours 
later. I tried to describe everything 
as precisely as 1 could and in com- 
plete detail until I noticed the 
white kid on the enameled pin in 
his lapel. •

And he talked about how we

After a while 1 started hitting

tacked the village instead of com-

If it was going to destroy the vil-

any reason for me to stay up in the

“The nest must have just missed

Shoogar nodded. “I saw it com-

there.” 

“Shoogar, that’s brilliant!” 

He shrugged modestly, brushed 
a speck of dirt from the sleeve of 
his robe. 

“It was nothing. I had planned 

so.” 

There was nothing more to say. 
We watched as he mounted the bi-

little plan didn’t work so good.” 
“Seeing you again helped me re- 
member,” said Mary. 

“Well,” said Screwloose, “no 
long-range harm done. We only 
have to fix up your mind again, 
Mary, and you’ll forget all this 
nasty stuff. Your dad taught me 
how. I can do it.” 

“No,” said the girl. 

I asked, “Me, too?” 

Screwloose replied, “No, you 
we’ll have to kill in some acciden- 
tal looking way. I was hoping 
you’d get drowned at Stinson 
Beach. I only just tonight figured 
Mary might have come back here 
for sentimental reasons. Had I 
thought of it earlier I would have 
beat you to it. Again, gee, there’s 
no real harm done. I know all 



( Continued from page 89) 

kinds of easy ways to kill people.” 
The playhouse door opened qui- 
etly again and Pope dived in. He 
held a cross-shaped tire iron. His 
first swing knocked Screwloose’s 
pistol away. Pope’s next two blows 
were to the android’s head and 
they caused him to fall back with 
an outflung jerking. 

“Gosh,” said the android. 

He began a slow tumble down 
to the floor. He was making loud 
whirring sounds and oily smoke 
came from his nostrils and mouth. 

“The reason I was a ljttle late,” 
said Pope. “I bumped into some 
landcars on the highway. It was a 
produce truck full of synthetic tan- 
gerines actually. I’d been trailing 
Screwloose since he left his place 
in Frisco. I lost him after the colli- 



145 



sion but figured he’d head here. I 
picked him up again at the gates. 
None of the alarms are working, 
by the way.” 

“I turned everything off,” said 
Mary, leaving the area of the 
teaching machines. “I don’t like all 
that stuff much.” 

“You just happen to be carrying 
a tire iron?” I asked Pope. 

“Actually,” he said, rings form- 
ing around his wide eyes, “I had a 
flat tire, too. After one of the 
truck drivers kicked my car. That’s 



what threw my timing a bit off.” 
“Your timing was fine,” I said. 
“This is Mary Redland, huh?” 
Pope asked, nodding at the girl. 
“You’ve been here hiding out?” 
“Not hiding out — thinking, try- 
ing to remember. I wanted to re- 
member everything. I wanted to re- 
member what they had done to 
me,” said the girl. “But I’m still 
not sure why they did it.” 

“Because we loved you,” said 
Screwloose. His head began to 
come apart. •

Ejler Jakobsson? It turns out that he’s 
just the most innovative editor in SF 
today. Thank God you’ve gotten rid of 
those ghastly beasts on the covers of 
If/ Thank God you’re starting to pub- 
lish a little adult fiction! (And I don’t 
mean sex, either.) The Region Be- 
tween and The Last Night of the Fes- 
tival are brilliantly presented, and even 
fine stories, too. But how much better 
as total visual experiences beyond just 
the words of them! Jack did a great 
job and / hope like hell that he does 
more. Good layouts like that really 
turn me on; good show, man! 

Anyhow, I am much much pleased 
with the direction that you’re heading 
your mags. Bless you, sir, bless you.

more violence in it than I care for, but 
in a world that includes the wars in

cited about a Bode drawing.

I HAVE been accused by some 
of my fellow writers of being 
overly fond of schmaltz in my re- 
action to some of the books re- 
viewed here in the past. With 
strong exception to that “overly,” 
I plead guilty to liking schmaltz 
and I make no apologies for it. 
But as a connoisseur of schmaltz, 
I am of necessity strongly opposed 
to the kitsch too often associated 
with it. 

Maybe a few quick definitions 
are in order. Schmaltz is a Ger- 
man-Yiddish word that means 
grease or butter; in the arts, it’s 
the grease the artist uses to make 
his bread — or more solid material 
—go down easily. It is, in fact, the 
appeal to the reader’s emotional 
response. Kitsch is garbage, trash, 
or any showy junk. Its use indi- 
cates a dishonesty, or an appeal to 
false emotionalism, snobbery, bad 
taste, etc. Where schmaltz is prob- 



ably an exaggeration of a real 
emotion, kitsch is either a distor- 
tion or the use of unreal emotion- 
al responses. 

Almost all romantic fiction is 
essentially schmaltz; it has to be, 
since a sane vierw of it indicates our 
lovers can very well live without 
each other, no matter how much 
the feeling engendered in the read- 
er is made to overlook this. Never- 
theless, the emotional state of the 
lovers is based on reality and only 
exaggerated to make it seem more 
interesting. On the other hand, the 
stuff in too many confession mag- 
azines and the old teen-age love- 
pulps was pure kitsch; almost no- 
body is as idiotic as the heroines 
— and if anyone were, she couldn’t 
have achieved the ending falsely 
grafted onto the story. Most grand 
opera is also kitsch, though justi- 
fied by the musical overlay. And, 
of course, the stuff called “camp” 




recently and appreciated at great 
effort by the phoney sophisticates 
had to be pure kitsch. 

Most of the best writers among 
the older practitioners of science 
fiction smoothed their plots with 
an admixture of schmaltz. And 
when it was that, without degener- 
ating into kitsch, it was a lot more 
effective than a mere recital of the 
story events would have been. 

P OUL ANDERSON has writ- 
ten some really superbly 
schmaltzy stories. His Nicholas 
van Rijn was in the purest vein in 
the original novel; no man was 
ever exactly like him, yet the basic 
elements of his character were 
drawn from life. The old hero-vil- 
lain obviously delighted the read- 
ers and Anderson has done a whole 
series of stories using him since 
then. 

Unfortunately, the latest doesn’t 
have the oomph of the earlier ones. 
Anderson’s Satan’s World (Dou- 
bleday, $4.95) has a generally in- 
genious situation and what might 
have been a good set of aliens and 
alienated humans to provide the 
menance. David Falkayn and his 
partners consult the giant comput- 
er of Serendipity, Inc. — a very nice 
use of information as a medium of 
exchange — to learn they have in- 
formation of more danger than ap- 
parent value. This brings their 
boss, old van Rijn, into things, and 
the plot tangles busily thereafter. 
It’s ingenious and the basic ac- 

148 



tion is fine. But somehow, the 
pitcher seems to have been to the 
well too often. Van Rijn is as clev-. 
er as ever, but the tough, hard core 
of the man is lost somewhere un- 
der the mere cleverness and surface 
mannerisms. It never degenerates 
to kitsch, but it becomes ineffectu- 
al schmaltz, with the grease too 
obvious. And since the only use 
for schmaltz is its effect, it’s hard 
to take when it doesn’t produce. 

Clifford Simak is another mas- 
ter of the difficult trick of getting 
just the right and subtle blend of 
schmaltz and solid story material. 
Few writers can blend background, 
suspense and just the right touch 
of emotional appeal as well as he 
usually manages. His recent Out 
of their Minds (Putnam, $4.95), 
however, has lost the touch, judg- 
ing by my response. 

The basic idea is really fantasy. 
All the beliefs that man has ac- 
cumulated in his superstitions 
throughout the ages have some- 
how fed into — well, call it another 
dimension or plane — and this ener- 
gy has been creating the very 
things men have imagined. Now 
the myth-creatures are beginning 
to break through and trying to 
take over EaTth. It isn’t too bad a 
situation. And in the early sec- 
tion, when his car is menaced by a 
dinosaur and when he isn’t sure 
how his friend was killed in a col- 
lision where the other car disap- 
peared, it begins to build up good 
suspense. 



IF 




But then the kitchen sink gets 
dragged in. He not only catches 
sea monsters and is chased by 
werewolves, but he meets Snuffy 
Smith and the comic-book world. 
He and a girl get trapped in a 
child’s fairyland where he meets 
the devil; and he is cast back into 
the Civil War, where he spends a 
good bit of time. 

When he gets out of that he 
finds the world has been overtly at- 
tacked by the devil, who has 
stopped all electric apparatus from 
working. The devil expects him to 
be a go-between in negotiations 
with the President, and . 

It’s simply too much, laid on 
too thickly. Myth-creation has run 
rampant. Goblins and werewolves 
were enough. But when we are 
asked to believe that men have be- 
lieved in comic book characters 
and such for long enough and 
deeply enough to have turned 
them into myth-creatures at least 
as real as the devil, we boggle a 
bit. And when the civil war gets 
dragged in as a myth, it is too 
thick; true, our history does be- 
come somewhat of a myth in time; 
but only a small percentage of the 
total world population knows 
enough or cares enough to feed 
much creative data into the myth- 
world. Paul Bunyon would cer- 
tainly be more likely than Pickett 
as a myth-figure. 

One form of kitsch results when 
the means used are excessive to a 
major degree for the effects needed. 

READING ROOM 



And here, I’m sorry to say the 
means are excessively excessive 
and the control of those means 
seems to have flown out the win- 
dow. It’s not pathetic kitsch (the 
trash of pathos , or untrammeled 
emotionalism), but its uncon- 
trolled use of piling one thing on 
another is almost as bad. 

A LMOST all sword-and-sor- 
cery, fantasy or science fic- 
tion, tends to be somewhat 
schmaltzy. Howard’s Conan was 
wonderful implicit schmaltz most 
of the time. (Implicit because 
Howard rather understated tne 
emotional response of his hero — 
but still schmaltz because the ro- 
mantic fix of his hero created such 
reactions on the part of the read- 
er.) Most deliberate attempts to 
imitate Conan have been purest 
kitsch, of course. But the mixture 
of brawling and sorcery still offers 
a great field. 

Marion Zimmer Bradley has 
been mining this field rather well. 
Her latest, The Winds of Darkover 
(Ace Double, 75c), is the seventh 
novel in the Darkover series. Here 
we have a world where the ancient 
inhabitants had substituted sorcery 
for science — or call it psi, if you 
like; no difference. And there are 
pools of psychic power, or nexus- 
collections, which act as the old 
gods were supposed to act. 

It is essentially formula-fiction, 
of course. Our hero is an Earth- 
man stationed on Darkover in the 

149 




little Earth enclave. He loses his 
job because his mind is sometimes 
taken over by a ruler of a Dark- 
over demesne. He is kicked out on 
a mission to help other natives, 
and his mind is more and more 
usurped until he becomes the ruler. 
Meantime, the ruler’s sister must 
hie forth on her own mission to 
contact him and awake with him 
the power of one of the old and 
dangerous goddesses. 

The good of the story is that 
Bradley has made the formula her 
own; it works as she wants it to. 
£or those who join me in enjoying 
the. schmaltz of good entertain- 
ment fiction, it’s to be recom- 
mended. 

The other half of the double vol- 
ume is The Anything Tree, by John 
Rackham. The tree here is appar- 
ently the ruler of a planet, and it 
has a rather limited mind but a 
great power to control growth; it 
can grow almost anything a man 
can ask of it — and it can even alter 
his growth, or cause adaptations in 
his cells. 

The conflict comes when the 
powerful but uniquely innocent 
tree first contacts minds of evil. 

It isn’t a story I’d recommend 
too strongly by itself, but it makes 
rather good reading. What more 
can be asked from a book frankly 
meant to be entertaining? 

Return to the Stars , by Edmond 
Hamilton (Lancer, 75c), is a long- 
delayed sequel to his Star Kings. 
John Gordon, whose mind was 

150 



transferred to that of a Prince of 
the far future who had to save the 
great Star Kingdom, is returned to 
that future in his own body this 
time, where he must meet in his 
own form the Princess he loved in 
another man’s body. 

The basic situation here is ripe 
for all the schmaltz one could de- 
sire. Yet there is considerable con- 
trol exercised— as there has been in 
most of Hamilton’s later material. 
No man has a longer history of 
writing the formula adventure 
story with all its inherent schmaltz 
than Hamilton; but the fact that he 
is still happily active after all these 
years is due to the skill with which 
he always treated his material. 

There is none of the tender re- 
union that would be so easily 
mixed with bathos. Instead, our 
lovely princess properly finds it 
hard to accept this man whom she 
never met in physical form before, 
and his attempt to understand is 
'clouded by the fact that to him he 
is really no different. Nor does he 
immediately take over the saving 
of the Star Kingdom again; the 
menace this time is out of his 
hands at first— because he’s simply 
a friend of the great King, not be- 
ing in the body of a Prince whose 
commands must be obeyed. 

It isn’t the best of Hamilton’s 
recent work; the job of going back 
and trying to recapture a world 
and attitude after having left it for 
years is a difficult one. And the 
limits he has imposed on himself in 

IF 




treating Gordon’s abilities within 
reason make it harder to buckle a 
fine swash. But he does come up 
with a fine “villain” whose corit- 
plexity was not fully revealed in 
the original story and who has att 
the charm we could want. 

It’s fun to read, particularly if 
you’ve wondered whether Gordon 
could ever get back to his Princess. 

R EX GORDON’S The Yellow 
Fraction (Ace, 60tf) seems at 
first to be based on a fairly stan- 
dard situation. Men have colo- 
nized Arcon. Now, a few hundred 
years later, they find that the plan- 
et is at best marginally suitable for 
men. Certain factors in the ecol- 
ogy of Arcon have made senility 
and death the common lot by the 
age of forty and there is a risk 
that this lack of time for the indi- 
viduals will make it impossible to 
maintain a civilization. 

But meantime they have de- 
stroyed their original spaceship, 
and their technology seems unable 
to build another. Politics has en- 
tered, too. The group who opposed 
settling Arcon and who later 
wanted to leave for another world 
are known as the Yellows and are 
considered the Enemy by the Blues 
and Greens. Arcon is actually 
ruled by a Security system design- 
ed supposedly to weed out danger- 
ous Yellows. 

Len Thomas is kicked out of 
school for advocating what is 
termed Yellow policies. And then

he discovers apparently that 
Security system is actually in the 
hands of the Yellows and that he is 
to be part of a small group sent to 
be trained for a voyage to another 
star in a spaceship being secretly 
built. 

However, the formula is being 
turned on its head by this time, 
and it becomes obvious to the 
reader that things are not at all as 
Thomas is first led to believe. Un- 
der all this, there is a rather ingen- 
ious set of political struggles and 
a well-worked-out solution to the 
problem of Darkover. 

Unfortunately, the writing is 
sometimes a little clumsy and the 
characters are less developed than 
the better-handled plotting de- 
serves. Gordon could use a good 
deal of careful editing and some 
detailed editorial advice; he shows 
more than enough promise here to 
deserve such attention. 

This is a case where there is 
comparatively little schmaltz — 
and where some could have been 
used most profitably. The love re- 
lation of Thomas and a girl being 
sent with him and the relations of 
the entire group deserve more 
emotional development. They are 
put in a damned good situation, 
but the dryness with which it is 
handed to us gives little more than 
a report of the events. 

The smaller bits, away from the 
group around Thomas, indicate 
that Gordon can sometimes cap- 
ture the emotional feeling of the 

151 




situation, and this makes it doubly 
unfortunate that some of the main 
events within the group going on 
the ship -are handed to us with so 
little real emotional color. 

It’s a somewhat annoying treat- 
ment of an interesting idea, but on 
balance the virtues are greater 
than the defects. 

Q UITE another judgment must 
be made on A Piece of Resis- 
tance , by Clive Egleton (Coward- 
McCann, $5.95). This is not ad- 
vertised on the jacket as science 
fiction, nor is it properly. Instead, 
it's one of those novels that takes 
place in the future simply because 
it can’t be squeezed into the pres- 
ent. Yet, since the publishers felt it 
should be sent to science-fiction 
reviewers and since it is built up as 
a novel about the future, I feel it 
should be covered here. 

The basic situation is that Eng- 
land has been conquered by Russia 
and is now occupied. There are 
collaborators and an underground, 
here represented by Garnett. The 
basic situation is standard spy 
stuff. The Russians have captured 
a resistance fighter who has infor- 
mation that can destroy the under- 
ground. Garnett is sent to free him 
(or probably to kill him, if neces- 
sary) before he can Reveal All. 

And from there on it’s pure 
kitsch — about as dishonest a use 
of the situation as is possible. 
There is almost no sign of any real 
reason for the underground. In 

152 



reading the book, there is a vio- 
lently stated anti-Russian anti- 
communist attitude and a constant 
iteration of how bad things are. 
But we see very little of that. The 
Russians we meet seem in only 
vague control, and we see very lit- 
tle of what they are doing; true, 
they seem to capture and be will- 
ing to shoot people who kill their 
people, but the rest of England 
goes on without any great evidence 
of the change. In fact, except for 
one mention, there seems almost 
no evidence of the war that was 
great enough to conquer the coun- 
try, despite its having involved 
atomic weapons. What America is 
doing or thinking, or what political 
changes have ocurred in the rest of 
the world, is left uncovered. 

There is the standard woman 
who may or may not be a double 
agent. And there is the equally 
standard encounter at a critical 
moment with a Russian patrol, 
which gives a chance to show how 
easily the (rather mild) Russian is 
bamboozled. But aside from some 
moments during the unbelievable 
attack on the prison where our 
captive is kept, most of the events 
are stated as being laden with 
drama and danger — but lack any 
real conviction of either. 

This attempt to lay a standard 
spy thriller in the future is hard to 
justify. It would have been a lot 
better laid in East Germany or 
some such place, and with an hon- 
est attention to background. This 

IF 




is as false to me as the attempt to 
graft sexy romances onto science 
fiction was back in the late thirties. 
That was such obvious kitsch that 
it failed completely on the stands. 

I can only hope that this will 
fail as badly, before we get a flood 
of science-fiction spy thrillers by 
men who know nothing of science- 
fiction technique. 



However, having had some ex- 
perience with the reviewing of 
books in most of our papers and 
magazines outside the science-fic- 
tion field, I’d hesitate to bet that it 
wouldn’t receive raves in most of 
the book columns. 

There is no reason for any sci- 
ence-fiction reader to bother with 
this, in any event. • 



THI COMMUNICATION MACHINE (Continued from page 78) 



cated at his feet. Thorpe brushed 
it aside and stormed across the 
room for his cape and his cane. 
His job was done and he had to get 
out of this palace of horrors. 

But the statue followed, a whim- 
pering thing that crawled after him 
and tugged at the embroidered 
edges of his cape. Cracked hands 
reached up to him and implored — 
they brought a memory of a more 
ancient touch that so enraged 
Thorpe that he yelled abuse and 
brought his jewel cane down upon 
that dreadful image. 

And again. 

And again. 

And again. 

With each blow the red ruin of 
Bedford’s face increased. Thorpe’s 
grip on the cane held down the 
triggering device imbedded in the 
handle and the stricken figure on 
the floor was thrown into a con- 
vulsions like those of a freshly 



speared fish. It whimpered and 
screamed and jumped about like 
a demented marionette. 

And died. 

With all his weight behind it 
Thorpe drove the cane into Bed- 
ford’s fat belly and held it there 
like a rapier, while the power 
threw the battered body into its 
final post mortem agonies. 
Thorpe’s mind had snapped. Like 
a man possessed he hurried around 
the room, tumbling rubbish and 
papers into piles and igniting them 
with his pocket lighter. When sev- 
eral fires were roaring through the 
room he hurried downstairs and 
threw open the first door he came 
to. 

It was some sort of study. He 
ripped opened drawers and spilled 
papers out onto the moth-eaten 
carpet. He dragged them over to 
where filthy drapes hung from one 
window and set the whole lot 



153 




ablaze. He smashed an old chair 
and used the legs for torches and 
carried them around the great de- 
serted house, downstairs and up, 
setting on fire everything he could 
reach. 

He felt sick and dizzy but he 
knew he had to finish what he had 
started. He must remove all traces 
of what had happened in this house 
—Bedford, his machine, and ev- 
erything connected with it. 

Everything. 

The furniture was old and 
burned well. In rto time at all the 
ancient timber house would be- 
come an inferno. He started to 
leave and flames reached out to 
him. 

With a dumb sort of compre- 
hension he realized that he had 
trapped himself. Smoke rose up in 
great billowing clouds to engulf 
him; fierce gusts of flame roared 
to possess him. 

He was suffocating. He moved 
forward like a drunken figure in a 
dream through the inferno of ha- 
tred he had created. He fell. Like 
a tumbling rag doll- he fell down 
the rotten stairs that had already 
begun to cave in under the burden 
of the flames, down into the hide- 
ous dark smoke. His body came 
to rest somewhere in the hallway 
and he coughed impotently. 

He would die. There was no es- 
cape. He could not move. His legs 
seemed to have been broken by the 
fall. Well, so be it. Perhaps it was 
better this way. To have lived out 



a life knowing what he knew — and 
then he remembered Bedford’s evil 
genius and death was no longer a 
pain. 

Fire was good — it cleansed. He 
would die a martyr’s death. What 
more could a poet ask? 

A great torrent of foam surged 
through what was left of the front 
door and covered him completely. 
Dimly he could here voices and the 
familiar howl of a fire siren. And 
he smiled, for he knew they were 
too late. The fire roared defiance 
at his rescuers — but the oceans of 
foam pushed it back — back — and 
anxious hands searched for and 
found him, carried him to safety. 

The last thing he saw was the 
roof of the old house collapsing 
into a great shower of sparks and 
he closed his eyes and was content. 
They hustled him into an ambu- 
lence and rushed him to the near- 
est hospital. 

F OR several days his escape was 
given front-page publicity — 
publicity that worked in well with 
the forthcoming Betjeman Prize 
Tourney, which he was a hot fa- 
vorite to win. When he was well 
enough he sat up in bed and scrib- 
bled verse frantically and with a 
new sense of purpose quite foreign 
to his temperament. He could not 
know that he was possessed by a 
terrible demon in the shape of a 
fear that time might, at any mo- 
ment, reel to a stop. 

A week was enough time for the 

IF 



154 




police to sift the evidence of the 
fire and work over Bedford’s 
charred remains. A warrant was 
summarily issued and Thorpe was 
removed to a police hospital while 
the crown prepared its case. But 
all this hardly mattered to him. He 
still scribbled incessantly. 

His trial was mercifully brief. 
He sat tense and uncommunica- 
tive throughout the proceedings 
and his counsel, defeated by his 
unwillingness to testify, was re- 
duced to making a plea of tempo- 
rary insanity and throwing him on 



the mercy of the court. The plea 
was accepted — the case was closed. 
Thorpe was transferred to a se- 
cluded institution where he con- 
tinued to churn out reams of in- 
comprehensible poems — his mind 
still held in thrall by what he had 
found in Bedford’s machine, know- 
ing what he knows and wondering 
how long it will be before some- 
body else starts fiddling around 
with Bedford’s ideas — and know- 
ing there is nothing he can do 
about it. 

For the rest of his natural life. # 



EQUALS FOUR { Continued from page 63 ) 



Hobgoblin. “I did that work my- 
self. There is nothing wrong with 
it.” 

Dillingham glanced at him tired- 
ly. So this was a personal matter 
with the goblin now. An excellent 
opportunity to embarrass the chief 
before his entire planet, to torpedo 
his prestige. 

He was tempted. The chief had 
tried to trick him, and the audi- 
ence had been thirsty for his blood 
right along. He could get even 
with the whole species of Hobgob- 
lin and make its dentistry the 
laughing stock of the galaxy. 

He saw that the Jann was back 
in his booth. That made it safe: he 
could tell off the planet with im- 
punity — the huge robot would va- 



porize anyone who dared to attack 
him. There would be blood and 
carnage and flame — 

Dillingham shook himself. What 
was he thinking of? He was here to 
make friends for the University, 
not to incite riot. He truly needed 
an assistant if his nerves were this 
tight. Someone to cool him off. 

“The work is excellent,” he said. 
“I could not do better myself. The 
cement is defective. Give it time 
and every restoration will come 
loose. This entire mouth will have 
to be redone. And every case 
where you used this type of ce- 
ment. They all are suspect.” 

The goblin dentist looked. He 
pried off another cap and saw the 
condition of the underlying ce- 



155 




ment. He sagged, confidence gone. 

“You’re right. Doctor. It was a 
new variety — not time-tested — but 
most highly recommended. We 
used it on our special patients — 
tourists, visitors, persons of 
note—” 

“Not your fault,” Dillingham 
said graciously, suddenly seeing 
the answer to those vague off-plan- 
et complaints. “Perhaps there is 
some quality of the local environ- 
ment that affects the cement as it 
is being applied. The University 
will be happy to run tests for you. 
It’s a shame to have work this 
good be undermined by something 
this small.” 

“Doctor,” the goblin said with 
surprising politeness, “you have 
made your point. University train- 
ing is beneficial. We shall act ac- 
cordingly.” 

Somehow this did not seem to 
be the proper time to confess that 
he had almost missed the key cavi- 
ty — or that only the timely re- 
minder by his bipedal assistant had 
prompted him to perform the rou- 
tine check that had led to the ma- 
jor discovery. 

His assistant — she had been per- 
fect. She had worked correctly and 
right without intruding. This was 
the one he wanted to keep. 

“What is your name and plan- 
et?” he asked her as he finished his 
preparations on the patient. 

“Miss Galland — Earth,” she 
said. 

“Very good, Miss Galland of 



Earth. I want you to — ” He 
stopped. He had suddenly realized 
what was strange about her voice. 
She wasn’t speaking through the 
translator. “Earth?” 

“Yes, Doctor,” she said as she 
cleaned up the patient’s ugly face. 

Dillingham straightened up and 
looked directly at her for the first 
time. She was a young, esthetic, 
female human being. 

“Judy!” he exclaimed, amazed. 
“Judy Galland— ” 

“I thought you’d never notice. 
Doctor,” she said smiling. “We al- 
ways worked well together.” 

“What are you doing here?” 
“Why, I’m assisting you. I 
thought you knew.” 

“I mean — I left you on Earth, 
back when — ” 

She smiled again. “That’s a long 
story, Doctor. -Let’s just say that I 
needed a position and there was an 
opening. After that matters be- 
came complicated. Deep space and 
all that. Frankly, your robot res- 
cued me from an unfortunate situ- 
ation.” 

“The Jann brought you? But he 
was supposed to be protecting me! 
I thought Miss Taran — ” 

“None but I shall do thee die,” 
the Jann boomed from his booth, 
startling them both and causing a 
ripple of dismay to pass through 
the massed goblins. “But thy skein 
will be too brief without a proper 
assistant. I perceived thou couldst 
not endure even forty years in thy 
solitary condition.” 



156 



IF 




Judy guided the patient out of 
the chair. ‘‘So y 0U see , Doctor, 
two plus two — ” 

“Equals four.” He grabbed her 
by the arm. “Come on— let’s get 
out of here before Miss Tarantula 
sends Number Fitfe. I’ll settle for 
Four.’’ 



“And a married man is far 
more likely to live to ninety-two,’’ 
the Jann observed, rising grandly 
from the booth. 

Fortunately Dr. Dillingham was 
not listening. But the goblin audi- 
ence certainly was and catcalls re- 
sounded. • 



SECOND-HAND STONEHENGE 

earth — a delicate arrangement, if 
you stop to think about it. Three 
months since Cathy stepped into 
that spacebus on a frosty morn- 
ing. 

I’d brooded around the house at 
Round Hill for three days after 
they’d left, never out of range of a 
radio or TV. By the end of the 
third day I was cursing the uni- 
verse again, reassessing, drinking 
too much. 

“Thomas?’’ Oh, that lovely 
voice from a far space. The Plei- 
ades? 

“Thomas — ’’ I was instantly so- 
ber, then immediately stoned again 
but with a different intoxication. 

“Cathy.’’ 

“It’s all right, Thomas. Your— 
genetic code — is all right. It can be 
modified.’’ I’m standing there, 
stunned. “It took some doing to 
arrange it, Thomas. We’ve only 
done it a few times in our whole 



(Continued from page 29) 

history. But you can come back— 
you can come here with me if you 
still want to, Thomas.’’ 

She knew bloody well I still 
wanted to but a woman is a wom- 
an no matter where she’s from. 
Yes, I wanted to. 

“Don’t be silly,’’ I said. 

MIT would have to survive 
without me. 

We said some other things then 
and she promised to see me in 
March. 

May I say that in the following 
weeks I took care of myself with 
megalomanic care? I didn’t cross 
a street against a light. I drove as 
little as possible and I took vitamin 
pills. I brushed my teeth. I didn’t 
look at the girls in the Square and 
I refused to fly in aircraft. The 
Pleiades, si — La Guardia, no. 

The Stonehenge isn’t for sale. 
Harry and his people need it. They 
may be using it for a long time. I 



157 



almost said we’ll be using it. Any- 
way, it will stay here on Round 
Hill. 

I’ll come back from time to 

time, of course, to look around, 
see what’s happening. We’ll have 
to come either for a few minutes 
or for three months. Cathy said we 
could come back for three months 
every two years. That will be great 
but we’ll be spending most of our 
time out there. 



The spacebus is due now. 

Here it is. Cathy, my lovely 
girl, is the first one out. There 
are others — who will stay for 
three months. The station wagons 
are here again but someone else 
will be taking oysr the Round Hill 
end of the operation. I’m going. 
We’ll be back now and again. 

Harry consulted his computer 
and told us to get aboard. 

We did. # 



GRANDFATHER PELTS 

pelts — while he had only one. 
Klaywelder turned over and closed 
his eyes. 

— and came fully awake. The 
luminous dial over his bunk said 
he had slept only a short hour. His 
senses were fuzzy from the strong 
Pharalellian wine. He cocked his 
head and listened. Nothing. He 
shrugged and turned over — then 
sat up stiffly. 

There it was again. Unfamiliar. 

He set his feet on the floor and 
something heavy draped over his 
ankles and wrapped softly about 
his calves. Klaywelder gasped and 
jerked away. The firm grip held, 
tightened, and he yelled as he was 
pulled to the floor. 



( Continued from page 101 ) 

Klaywelder fought savagely. He 
kicked, pummeled with his fists. 
His blows were muffled in thick, 
warm fur, as damp leather tight- 
ened about his waist and inched up 
across his chest. 

He screamed and cursed himself 
and Garii and the universe until his 
throat was raw. And in some last, 
coherent corner of his mind he 
wondered if anyone else knew Pha- 
ralellians didn’t believe in a life af- 
ter death — and didn’t need to. 

As thick golden fur covered his 
face he saw a quick bright picture 
of dark earthen cups on a smooth 
stone floor — small offerings of 
reverence for those who had passed 
on to Eternal Life. •
