Like most students in the 2 1st cen- 
tury, Angie Patterson got her educa- 
tion through time travel — learning 
sex techniques by visiting the bodies 
of women long dead and attending 
the original performances of 
Shakespeare’s plays. 

But now she was caught in the 
body of Elizabeth Tudor — trapped 
with a secret that could smash all of 
past, present, and future . ,

What if the cycle of rebirth is dis- 
rupted by a machine that captures 
souls at the moment of death? 

And what if one of those souls 
has been followed for centuries in 
a brilliant plan for cosmic revenge? 
“From one angle, it is a horror 
story of humans enslaved by tech- 
nologies fostered by desperate 
men to advance America's mili-

From another, it is the engrossing 
story of three people locked in a

The planet had a great transport 
system — all you had to do was 
catch a worg. But that wasn’t 
easy, especially when the worgs 
developed “motor” trouble! 



i 

Tuf. worg moved slowly, stopping 
every few seconds to munch on the 
lender undergrowth. Its diet con- 
sisted normally of leafy plants, but 
here it grazed on better fare, the 
young shoots of red bamboo. 

Clouds above blocked one of the 
twin moons and soon would cover 
the other, but the darkness would 
have no effect on the near-blind 
creature. Three stubby antennae pro- 
jecting toward the ground provided 
all the senses it needed. A keen 
sense of smell and a bat-like sonar 
would lead it to the best grazing 
and guide it around the larger rocks 
and the giant ponders. 

The huge triplets of padded feet 
crushed yard after yard of normal 
fare while the mandibles greedily 
ripped up the more tender shoots. 
Deep inside the bulbous head, a 
tiny brain was registering something 
akin to pleasure, though any true 
thought on the matter was well be- 

PARASITE 



yond its capabilities. 

Instinct alone guided its motion. 
Instinct and the driving need for 
fourteen to eighteen tons of grasses 
and shrubs each night. Yet, that 
impressive quantity of food sus- 
tained only a low metabolic rate. 
Indeed, most of the natural activity 
of the massive beast consisted of 
eating followed by more eating, fol- 
lowed by a full twenty hours of 
sleep during the daylight hours. 

The worg paused momentarily as 
it sensed motion to its left. Then it 
moved on in its previous course. A 
kilometer or so away was another 
one, moving out of the ponders and 
into the clearing. Worgs often met 
like this in open grazing land. Other 
than an occasional scuffle over 
choicer grazing areas, no harm 
came from the encounters. 

Somehow this was different. If 
the worg’s mind had been even a 
little more discerning, it would have 
noticed a strangeness about this 
newcomer. It grazed on in igno- 
rance. 

7 




The newcomer approached stead- 
ily, moving at a pace of thirty 
kilometers per hour, well above 
grazing stride. It also approached in 
a nearly straight line, passing lush 
patches of growth on either side that 
should have drawn its attention. 

The center legs were lifting in a 
skipping motion, barely holding 
their own with the more agile outer 
rows. Their normal function, that of 
supporting most of the creature’s 
massive weight, had to give way to 
the urgent demands of the driving 
motive legs. The creature strained 
and suffered from the shift in 
stresses, but on it ran, in a frenzy 
its feeble mind could not com- 
prehend. 

The grazing beast sensed danger 
only a second before the^ collision. 
It reacted by starting to turn toward 
the rushing nemesis, a move which 
only aided its enemy. With its body 
curved toward the onrushing crea- 
ture, its armor plates tended to bind 
against themselves and its weight 
shifted to the outer legs. 

The rushing worg’s head struck 
low on the side of the other’s 
protective bony plates. One plate 
cracked ominously, sending echoes 
off the forest wall. Others bent and 
buckled, thrusting the nearer legs up 
and off of their formerly secure 
footing. Long seconds passed as the 
surprised creature spun upward, roll- 
ing onto its side and then over onto 
its back. 

Looking much like a turtle with 
too many legs, the worg rocked 
from side to side, kicking frantically 
at the silver-rimmed clouds hanging 
overhead. 

The aggressor stopped, its own 
plates still quivering from the im- 

8 



pact. It stopped, and started to 
graze on the red bamboo shoots. 

Over the crunching sound of the 
grazing mandibles and the thrashing 
of the downed creature’s legs, a 
third sound emerged . 

“. five, six, seven. Go! 
Now! ” 

Three figures dropped to the 
ground near the central row of legs 
some ten meters behind the mandi- 
bles. They jumped over the outer 
foot pads and moved toward the 
thrashing shadow before them. 

“Carlston, are you sure this one 
is going to stop?” 

“They always do. As soon as 
they get flipped over, they kick up 
a real fuss for about forty seconds, 
then they stop. When it stops. I’ll 
have about twenty seconds to get up 
the side before it starts a turnover 
twist.” 

“Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen!” 

Two flash beams from holes in 
the side of the placidly grazing 
beast lit up the downed creature. 
The legs kicked wildly in the artifi- 
cial light. Two of the men dropped 
to their knees and aimed cable 
launches at the edge of the curving 
plates some twelve meters above 
them 

“Get closer. Tan! The cable will 
fall short!” 

“But Sarge?!” 

“Closer!” 

“Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, 
he stopped!” 

The launchers snapped loudly and 
the lines flew upward. Tan’s hit 
low, a full two meters below the 
rim, but the other struck very near 
the edge of the armor. 

Carlston grabbed the second’s 
loop and ran toward the huge curv- 



GA1AXY 




ing wall of carapace. Tan dropped 
his launcher and jumped to aid Blair 
with the winch on the second 
launcher. 

"What a lousy shot," Tan mur- 
mured as he grasped the line. 

"Good enough for a first lime. 
This is my ninth ... all you need 
is practice. Hang on!” 

Carlston reached the side and 
jumped upward, planting his spiked 
boots into the side. He scuffled, 
slipped only once, and then walked, 
lly-like, up the plate. Tan and Blair 
kept the line tight, lifting most of 
the Surge’s weight up toward the 
now-still legs. 

Six seconds had passed, accord- 
ing to the crewman in the other 
worg, when he reached the outer 
row of legs. With most of these 
creatures he would have had another 
fourteen seconds to cross to the 
center legs and establish anchorage 
before the creature began to move 
again. But this one? . This one 
seemed quicker than most. Carlston 
had better move. 

Carlston reached the center row. 
lie estimated that he was at the 
eighteenth or nineteenth leg, about 
thirty meters from the head. He, too, 
worried about the quickness of this 
worg and about the time left to se- 
cure himself. Anxiously, he began 
to set the anchors. 

The twist started at sixteen sec- 
onds. Carlston missed the fourth 
anchor, striking the soft under- 
plates and dropping it and the 
hammer. He lurched back as the 
worg began his first twist and then 
pulled himself closer to the anchors. 
The worg was almost on its side be- 
fore he had the straps tight enough 
to hold him firmly.

PARASITE

Within a minute after the initial 
impact, there were two worgs graz- 
ing on red bamboo shoots, one 
with a solitary rider strapped be- 
neath, the other, three riders lighter 
and soon to be empty. 

The anchors held. Carlston 
loosened the straps. By tilting his 
head back, he could look down and 
forward at the mandibles. 

The moons had reappeared, but 
here in the shadow of this animated 
lawn mower, only his small wrist 
beam allowed him to see. If his 
guess was correct, he only had to 
move forward about three or four 
segments to reach the lower nerve 
center. 

Below him, on the rims of the 
feet, were the sensor hairs. To fall 
between the feet, to touch one hair, 
meant certain death. Probably an in- 
stinctive preservation mechanism, 
the hairs triggered rapid twitching 
and a stomping reaction. The 
worg’s six-foot-wide foot pads 
would easily crush Carlston and 
bury him in one stroke. He wished 
for the fourth anchor. 

The hammer, dangling from its 
wrist strap, was quickly recovered 
and he began his move. Checking 
the forward two anchors, he slowly 
released the third. The two held. 

He moved the anchor forward 
and drove it home. He locked it in 
place and moved forward cau- 
tiously. Each step in the process 
moved him forward about half a 
meter, less as he crossed the plate 
overlap areas. For half an hour the 
worg grazed on. For half an hour 
Carlston eased forward. 

There it was. The greenish lateral 
stripe which indicated the nerve 
center. The stripe itself was due to 



the fluids which flowed from the 
creature’s three huge hearts. The 
fluids, heavy in chloroplasts from 
the leafy diet, carried energy to the 
nerve centers. 

With the skill of a sculptor turned 
surgeon, Carlston chiseled his way 
through the armor plate and located 
the nerve center. The center itself 
was smaller than a baseball but only 
one small part was of present inter- 
est. There at the back, a small 
thumbnail-sized segment stood out 
slightly in the light beam. 

Carlston reached into the left zip- 
pered pocket of his tunic and pulled 
out one of the small plastic tubes. 
Breaking the tip, he squeezed the 
orange-gray paste onto the nodule. 
Now to wait. Always to wait. 

Worgs were handy creatures, 
predictable and useful. They pro- 
vided food supply as well as trans- 
portation. The muscle tissue, similar 
to a soft veal, was high in protein. 
The fatty tissue could be extracted 
for fuel. Their empty shells made 
good houses. But their primitive 
mental and nervous system, coupled 
with their size, made for waits. 

He waited. Slowly the drug was 
absorbed into the nerve center. 
Then out through major ganglion. 
Then finally to the sensitive bases 
of each hair. With the sensors 
deadened, the short-circuit pile 
drivers would not threaten the lives 
of the other crew members as they 
boarded. Worg crews tended to tax 
the huge beast’s strength after a few 
months’ use. These changes of 
transportation now occurred almost 
routinely. 

As he waited, the Sarge did some 
calculating. Thirty seconds of 
thrashing, versus thirty-five min- 



10 



GALAXY 




imum and thirty-nine average. Fif- 
teen or sixteen seeonds versus 
twenty normal on the roll-over. 

Normally, the nerves would be 
“off” in about eight minutes. At 
six minutes he made the first test. 
He eased the hammer strap down- 
ward toward the hairs in the light of 
his wrist beam. 

The first contact caused only five 
or six stomps. He wasn't sure, it 
was hard to count being jarred 
around like that. But it was no- 
where near the two dozen or so he 
had expected. 

An interesting creature, this one. 
Worthy of more study. 

He yelled out at the two other 
members of the ground crew. “Tan! 
Blair! Disembark!” 

At the signal, the two flashed the 
all-clear to the crew in the other 
worg. Soon eight men were busy 
under their new host, cutting the 
key man-holes and boring their way 
into the creature. 

If the interior of the worg had 
been completely solid, its use would 
have been limited. The muscle tis- 
sue for the legs and support lay 
within the lower five feet of the 
body. Above that, the fatty storage 
area consisted of compartmented 
cells, roughly triangular in shape 
and three to six feet across. Groups 
of these cells formed internal seg- 
ments. Each segment filled only 
sixty to seventy percent of the sur- 
rounding carapace shell. The fatty 
cells were attached to the upper 
shell segments and to each other 
through a network of thick tendon- 
like fibers. 

The maze formed by the fibers 
and cells was somewhat confusing 
to the new crew merpber but 



quickly learned and mastered. By 
cutting a few of the more trou- 
blesome fibers and three or four 
cross passages through the cells 
themselves, one could easily move 
through the beast at a running gait. 
For convenience, a long central 
passage was usually cut through the 
length of the fatty cells. 

Within an hour the key forward 
passageway had been cut through 
and work had begun on the others. 
Carlston, with permission from Cap- 
tain Gatis, had avoided the labor 
crew in favor of some desk work. 

He had quickly set up the aft 
port-a-desk over the man hole. 
Using a flash beam, he studied the 
worg’s reactions in detail. Periodi- 
cally he tested the worg’s responses 
to various electrical impulses. The 
computer in the desk checked his 
observations against his quickly 
formed theories and reported back 
to him. 

An hour and two minutes. The 
computer had predicted an hour and 
ten. Carlston had predicted one hour 
and six. An hour and two minutes 
had passed since the nerves went 
dead and now they were fully active 
again. The norm was just shy of 
two hours. 

The initial shock of a full-force 
stomp brought yells of derision 
from all over the worg. Although 
the scolding was aimed at Carlston, 
each crew member realized fully 
that the stomp was much too early. 
Each sensed that this worg was de- 
cidedly different than most. 
Carlston considered a second probe 
but instead withdrew from the man- 
hole and secured the recorder. He 
was soon back to the routine super- 
vision of the work crews. 



PARASITE

By five p.s.*, only three hours 
after they first spotted the new 
worg, the cross passages were cut, 
the bunk rooms were roughed-in, 
and a command room was in opera- 
tion inside the dome of the worg’s 
head. 

“We have about nine hours till 
sun-up, Sergeant. Dismiss the men 
for some sleep. We’ll cut the long 
hall in the morning. Set up normal 
watch cycles. One man to check the 
controls and the detectors.” 

“Aye, Sir,” Carlston answered. 
“Sir . have you had a chance to 
check my recording?” 

“Yes, briefly. A strange bug, 
this one?” 

"Yes, Sir, a strange bug indeed. 
We’ll have to watch our maneuvers. 
It responds faster than any I ever 
rode.” 

II 

Faint sun’s rays eased over the 
horizon, edging the black sky with 
a blue-green light. The twin moons, 
spiraling endlessly around each 
other, had set earlier, leaving the 
planet with only an occasional star 
shining through holes in the clouds. 

Blair had the last watch. The un- 
eventful hours were spent in detail- 
ing the command room, anchoring 
the control desks and cutting map 
shelves in the gelatinous walls. 
Once every ten minutes, he stopped 
to scan the countryside through the 
main ports. The small periscope al- 
lowed full 360-degree I.R. scanning 
of the broad meadow with its tall 
grasses and leafy brush. 

♦p.s. Pos! Sunset. A third twelve-hour 
period established to allow for Cygnus I V's 
thirty-six hour day. 



The night sounds were somewhat 
muffled by distance and the 
everpresent crunching of the worg’s 
mandibles. Slowly the night’s 
voices gave way. The first rim of 
pale light on the horizon drove 
some into hiding, waking others to 
replace them. Even though the sun 
itself would not appear for another 
three hours, the daylight creatures 
were beginning to stir. 

As the end of his watch ap- 
proached, Blair paused longer at the 
ports. Of all the watches, he liked 
the morning best. High in the pon- 
ders he heard the morning songs 
and watched the first probing flights 
of the lace-winged- birds. 

In spite of their oversized wings 
and fragile frames, they still re- 
minded him of the birds of home. 
Home. Would they ever get back? 
The annoying doubts nibbled at his 
mind. Four years had passed since 
their arrival . Four long years by 
earth time . Six since their de- 
parture from earth. 

Yet it was only three ‘years,’ 
three longer years, by Cygnus IV 
accounting, Only three cycles of 
rain, fog and heat. Three ‘years’ of 
thirty-six hour days. Cycles which 
men grew accustomed to slowly, if 
at all. 

He watched as the birds tested 
the air. As the light slowly in- 
creased, they ventured ever farther 
from the shelter of those impossibly 
tall trees. 

His reverie was interrupted by a 
sudden silence. The worg stopped 
eating. In a few moments it re- 
sumed. Then it stopped again. It. too, 
sensed the light. Soon it would stop 
completely and move toward a wa- 
tery bed in a nearby bog.

GALAXY 




Blair checked the time and began 
his rounds of the sleeping quarters. 
Control cables had been run during 
the night watches. The control desk 
was ready, but the delicate job of 
connecting the wires and tubes to 
the nerve centers was yet to be 
done. That was Carlston’s job. 

Sergeant Carlston, who had cap- 
tured the first live worg two years 
earlier, was the expert. That first 
bug was less than thirty meters long 
and took quite some doing to han- 
dle. This one, nearly the size of a 
football field, would be easier to 
handle — not because of size but be- 
cause of the experience of the crew. 

As the worg reluctantly moved 
tiway from the red bamboo, a more 
reluctant crew crawled out of their 
bunks to begin another long day. 



* * * 



Charts and more charts. Maps, 
some sketchy, some detailed, lay 
before the Captain. Bit by bit their 
geographical knowledge of the 
planet grew. Their daily exploration 
was slowly adding detail to the orbi- 
tal photos taken before the In- 
trepid's abortive landing. 

But geography was of little value. 
Little value indeed. 

"1 think Hatcher was right. Cap- 
tain.'' It was Lt. Dixon who spoke 
;is he entered the control room. A 
metal detector extended from his 
clenched fist. 

“About what. Lieutenant?" 

“About this planet. I think it’s all 
rock. Lots of sodium and lithium 
and calcium but no heavy metals. 
At least we can’t find any. Doc 
Hatcher said we wouldn’t.” 

PARASITE 







“Hatcher? But he was killed dur- 
ing the crash.” 

“Yes, Sir.” Dixon wired the de- 
tector to the desk as he answered. 

“Well, how could he know what 
was here before we landed?” 

“He worked in astro-physics. 
During the pre-landing orbits, he 
checked out the physical data pretty 
well. This rock is larger than earth 
with only two-thirds’ the gravity. It’s 
too light to have much in the way 
of metals . Look at the read- 
outs!” 

The narrow tape coming from the 
desk computer showed no evidence 
of substantial amounts of metal ores 
heavier than aluminum. To the 
trained eye the various tracings on 
the chart indicated quickly the 
major ores present and, up to one 
hundred meters down, their loca- 
tion. The compass line gave data on 
distance and direction traveled and 
elevation from a reference point, 
namely the Settlement. 

Good data to fill out the maps. 
Discouraging data for the geological 
reports. 

“If there is any iron or nickel 
around. Sir, it must be way down 
there.” A tone of resignation had 
entered the Lieutenant’s voice. 

“You may be right. Lieutenant. 
Do you think it would help to probe 
deeper? The Electronics Group 
might be able to increase the detec- 
tor's range?” 

“Personally. Sir?” he ventured. 
“No, Sir, I don’t. ” 

“But there have to be iron de- 
posits.” It was Blair who broke in, 
suddenly. 

“Yes?” The Captain’s voice 
seemed eager for some positive turn 
in the conversation. 



Blair turned from the controls to 
continue. “The life forms. Cap- 
tain.” The answer made little sense. 
“Well? What about them?” 

“I’m no expert but they must be 
almost as high in metallics as 
Earth’s.” He could see from the 
faces of the other two men that he 
had to continue but he wasn’t so 
sure he wanted to. “Well . take 
blood for example . doesn’t it 
require iron ... to absorb the oxy- 
gen? The animals we’ve found, the 
warm-blooded ones, all have red 
blood. ” 

“Traces,” interjected Lt. Dixon, 
“That's all it takes for red blood, 
and that’s all we can find. Maybe 
we should be grateful for small 
blessings; at least there’s enough 
iron in the local meat to stretch our 
rations. But it isn’t going to help us 
get back to Earth — not unless we 
can figure a way to, say, refine 
Toppers’ blood. ...” 

“Now that’s not a bad idea!” 
The Captain was glad for any bit of 
humor to break the building mood. 
“Put it in the log. Lieutenant.” 
“Hah! Yes, Sir; I’ll do that.” 
“Seriously, Blair, why don’t you 
check with the biology people and 
see what they can find out about 
how the animals get their iron. 
They must be able to come up with 
something.” 

“Maybe, but I don't know what. 
They’ve tested all the surface vege- 
tation. It has traces of iron, of 
course, and the traces get more 
concentrated as you move up the 
food chain. Nothing surprising 
there; all it proves is that you’d 
have to collect grass clippings by 
the shipload to get enough iron for 
a few nuts and bolts. Assuming we 



14 



GALAXY 




had the energy to do that kind of 
‘refining’ in the first place.” 

“Weren’t the Toppers supposed 
to have higher iron levels than any 
of the plains animals? We still don’t 
know much about any additional 
sources they might have, do we?” 

“The Toppers aren’t exactly 
cooperative. Sir. We’ve tried to 
steer clear of them since they 
started making sporadic attacks. 
We’ve got too much to do without 
fighting Toppers if we can avoid 
it.” 

“Well, we can’t afford to over- 
look any possibilities at this stage.” 

“Yes, Sir, I’ll check in with 
Biology on it.” 

The Captain’s attention returned 
to the charts. Sector by sector they 
had searched for the badly needed 
metals. His crew and six others had 
worked at ever-increasing distances 
from the Settlement. 

The first prospecting had been 
done in the “most likely” rugged 
areas to the north. Now the efforts 
were systematically covering every 
sector in an ever increasing spiral. 
For over a year the crews had 
sought workable ores — ores for 
metals to build the heavy machinery 
and the parts to repair the Intrepid. 

As the explorations had gone 
from hundreds of square miles of 
likely areas to thousands of square 
miles in all directions, hopes had 
waned. Irritations grew and Com- 
mand had wisely changed the offi- 
cial policy for crews from “geol- 
ogy” to “geography.” And the 
emphasis in the Settlement was now 
on improving living standards in the 
community. 

But every worg crew still carried 
a geology expert like Dixon. 



“Take us southeast for another 
forty kilometers, Blair.” The Cap- 
tain indicated a map coordinate to 
the attentive crewman. “Then let’s 
head back to base for a rest and 
new orders. ” 

“Yes, Sir! Should I pass the word 
around. Sir?” 

“Go ahead. The crew could use a 
lift.” 

Ill 

The raid had started quietly. At 
sunrise the first group of Toppers 
stopped at the ridge overlooking the 
Settlement. The sun to their backs, 
they paused momentarily to look 
down on the roughly symmetrical 
rows of rounded huts. 

These shells of worgs, taken 
mostly for food and fuel, now 
served as homes, offices, 
laboratories, and even a chapel. Not 
far from the edge of the cluster of 
dead but occupied shelters stood 
the Intrepid. Dwarfing even the 
largest worg shell, the gleaming 
beauty of the intricate ship was 
marred only by the damage to the 
aft hull and fins. 

The original damage had been 
more severe. Time and the talents 
of the surviving crew members, 
some 220 in all, had repaired most 
of the craft. 

The repairs had required the 
scavenging of metals from the aft 
section. The ship now stood waiting 
for the prospecting crews to find the 
needed ores to rebuild its stress- 
bearing beams and skin. 

Near the ship, an odd assortment 
of worg shells housed the machine 
shop, improvised smelter and 



PARASITE 



15 




ceramic forges. All waited for the 
ores to be found. 

From the ridge, little activity 
could be seen. Little existed. A few 
Toppers moved forward. Their lack 
of organization was made up for by 
a determination based on a growing 
hatred of the scene before them. 

As the first group moved, others 
followed. Soon, even the most 
timid sub-tribes were advancing— 
first, at a slow walk, then at a trot 
and, finally, at a dead run. 

The long arms and prehensile 
toes hinted at their normal tree-top 
existence but the three stubby legs 
were surprisingly agile on the 
ground. They moved in a skipping 
rhythm with the hindmost leg 
launching the other two forward in 
extraordinary spinning strides. 

The tri-pedal symmetry, so com- 
mon on Cygnus IV, had given them 
a defensive mechanism to be en- 
vied. For all practical purposes, 
they had no front . and no back. 
You could not get behind a Topper. 
They effectively had 360-degree vis- 
ion with three beady eyes placed 
high on the head. Each eye was 
centered between two of the three 
spindly arms. 

The largest weighed no more than 
fifty pounds, but their gaunt frames 
made them seem bigger. As they 
gained speed, their hands wielding 
clubs or stones, they seemed much 
bigger. 

The sentry’s alarm came late as 
the figures took shape against the 
blazing sunrise. His cry was more 
of startled fear than prearranged 
signal. He was the first man to fall. 
But only after he had downed sev- 
eral Toppers with his automatic 
rifle. 

16 



The sentry’s alarm, followed by 
the rifle fire, had the desired effect. 
Although some of the defenders 
emerged from their quarters only 
partly dressed, all had weapons 
ready. 

The Toppers’ assault was at a 
frenzy. Like creatures gone berserk, 
they seemed to strike at everything 
in sight except their own kind. They 
numbered well over two thousand 
as they entered the settlement. 

Rifles and side arms barked death 
at the invaders but, senselessly, 
they continued to advance directly 
into the fire. By sheer numbers they 
gained some ground, but their 
numbers fell quickly. 

Within half an hour it was over. 
The Toppers had scattered back to 
the woods, leaving some six 
hundred of their kind dead or dying 
among the domed shelters. 

Only five men were dead. Sev- 
eral others were badly beaten but 
only a few were incapacitated. The 
physical damage to the structures 
and equipment in the path of the as- 
sault was high. In the frenzied at- 
tack, entire segments of the worg 
shells were smashed in or ripped 
away. 

Colonel Reading winced as the 
Doctor Hyotte worked on his bat- 
tered left arm. “Matt, I want a 
complete damage report. Has a 
perimeter been established?” 

“Yes, Sir,” Major Mattson an- 
swered. “What should we do with 
the wounded Toppers?” 

“Ouch!” the Colonel winced. 
“Watch what you’re doing, Doc! 
What’s your opinion? Do you think 
we should hold them or just kill 
them off?” 

“We don’t have enough medical 
GALAXY 




supplies to treat them all, but I’d 
like to keep several of the healthier 
ones under observation for a 
while.” The doctor finished his 
work on the Colonel’s arm . “There. 
That should hold your arm together 
for awhile. What do you think, 
Colonel?” 

“About the arm or the Toppers?” 
The Colonel looked warily at the 
bandages. 

“The Toppers,” he smiled. 

“Okay, keep the ones you want. 
Matt, have the others shot.” 

“Yes, Sir. Sir, do you think 
they’ll be back?” 

“Well, according to the reports, 
they’re beginning to form small 
groups at the edge of the forest 
again. Correct?” 

“Yes, Sir.” 

“Yes, Matt, I think they’ll be 
back. Now that we’re alert, they 
shouldn’t be able to get close 
enough to do any damage. It’ll be 
suicide, but they’ll probably attack 
again. ” 

“Why, Colonel? Why did they 
attack us in force? We’ve had trou- 
ble with isolated crews being hit be- 
fore, but there’s never been more 
than a few dozen of them. We kill- 
ed more Toppers today than I’ve 
seen since we’ve been here.” 

“That, Major, is the prime ques- 
tion. I wish I knew the answer.” 

“It may help if I can study 
them. ” The doctor continued as he 
repacked his kit. “I’ll need a cage 
big enough to hold them.” 

“Will wood and mylacord hold 
them?” 

“They're strong, but I think it 
will. ” 

The Major anticipated the Col- 
onel’s order. “Yes, Sir. We’ll build 

PARASITE 



a cage against the end of the 
machine shop, next to medical.” 

As he spoke, scattered rifle fire 
could be heard at the edge of the 
settlement. The second wave had 
begun. 

IV 

The worg's pace now exceeded 
eighty kilometers per hour. Blair 
worked the controls with obvious 
excitement. Sargeant Carlston and 
Captain Gatis studied the desk. 
Input data, some from the crew’s 
officers and some picked up directly 
from the worg’s nerve centers, be- 
came output data. 

“The entire metabolism is ac- 
celerating.” The Sergeant indicated 
the charts as he spoke. “Most 
worgs can’t do four hundred 
kilometers a day. Yesterday we 
covered six hundred before sunset. 
Today we could cover twice that.” 
“Yes, but we’ll be at the Settle- 
ment in an hour. ” 

“Yeah. I almost wish we 
weren’t. I’d like to ride this thing 
out and see how active it be- 
comes.” 

“Blair, how does it handle?” 
“Terrific, Captain. Control re- 
sponse is good, but I could use a 
larger port to see out of.” 

“What about stopping her? Do 
the ‘brakes’ work as well as the 
gas?” 

“I think so. Should I put her 
through some fancy maneuvers?” 
“You’d better alert the crew first. 
Captain,” Carlston interjected. 

“Okay. Let’s see what she can 
do. ATTENTION, ALL HANDS 

With the crew alerted over the 

17 




intercom, Blair proceeded to put the 
huge worg through delicate high- 
speed turns. Stopping response was 
sudden — so sudden that some of the 
charts and shelved equipment tum- 
bled to the floor. One turn was so 
tight that the worg’s plates scraped 
together, nearly locking. Half of the 
legs on the inside row lifted clear of 
the ground. Only Blair's quick ac- 
tion on the nerve impulse controls 
prevented a roll-over. 

As Blair returned to the plotted 
course, the Captain smiled. 
“Carlston, you had better get Blair 
that larger port. If he’s going to 
drive like that, he needs it.” 

"Yes, Sir!” 

“And, Carlston, maybe you 
should plan on staying with this one 
when we get back to base. It needs 
a lot more study. If we can figure 
out how to speed them all up like 
this, we can double or triple our 
prospecting efforts.” 

“Yes, Sir. I’m probably going to 
need another desk. Do you 
think . ” 

His words ended abruptly as a 
sharp cry came from Blair. “Top- 
pers! Captain! Two o’clock!” 

As the worg rounded the knoll, 
the group of Toppers could be seen 
near a clump of brush almost a 
kilometer ahead. 

“Captain, there must be a 
hundred of them!” 

“Yes, and they’re pretty far from 
home. There's no tall timber for 
some distance. ” 

The Toppers were moving at a 
trot across the rolling terrain. 
Apparently, their own hurried pace 
kept them from noticing the worg’s 
approach, until the gap closed to 
less than half a kilometer. 



“They’ve seen us, Captain,” 
Blair called out. 

“Look at them scatter.” 

The Toppers had seen them. The 
presence of the huge, rumbling 
creature normally brought little con- 
cern to the Toppers, but the normal 
worg was asleep during full sunlight 
hours, usually half buried in mud or 
shallow swamp land. 

This was daylight. This worg was 
awake and moving. It had taken a 
few confused moments for the Top- 
pers to realize the worg’s speed. In 
those occasional morning encounters 
between grazing worgs and Top- 
pers, the Toppers could easily out- 
run the lumbering worg. Groups of 
twenty or so would occasionally at- 
tack and pester one of the huge 
bugs. But this one appeared menac- 
ing indeed. 

Some stumbled. A few fell, as 
the tribe broke up in confusion. 
Some stopped to help their fallen 
companions. Several paused to hurl 
stones at the head of their attacker. 

Blair turned the worg, skillfully 
following the heaviest concentration 
of Toppers. Twenty or more were 
killed on the first pass. 

“Captain, I’ve never seen such a 
large group.” Blair brought the 
worg into a sweeping tum, selecting 
his next targets. 

“Neither have I . Carlston! 
Look at their trail!” He pointed at 
the swath of broken grass, which 
from the end looked like a long 
ragged runway. The path closely 
paralleled the clearer three-rutted 
trail left by their own passage. 

“Looks like they were headed the 
same way we were.” The Ser- 
geant’s face showed traces of 
worry. 



18 



GALAXY 




“Yes, the Settlement! 1 don’t like 
the looks of this. Blair, turn her 
around. Head for home at top 
speed.” 

“But, Captain, I can get them 
all.” 

“Do it, Blair!” The Captain’s 
tone had changed. 

★ ★ ★ 

The fifth wave of Toppers started 
toward the Settlement. They no 
longer approached directly. Using 
the low brush as cover, they danced 
and spun across the fields toward 
the shelters. 

They had lost more comrades 
than the whole of the first wave. 
Over three thousand lay strewn 
across the fields. But their numbers 
had increased as tribe after tribe 
joined the attack. With eight or nine 
thousand, they now attacked on a 
broad front. 

The Settlement’s defense perime- 
ter had widened to cover 180 de- 
grees. Barricades of all descriptions 
had been thrown up between the 
outer shells to provide an almost 
solid wall. 

The Major’s concern was appa- 
rent. “Colonel, we’ve lost eight 
men, with maybe fifteen seriously 
injured. If they keep growing in 
numbers like this, they’re eventually 
going to get through.” 

“1 know. Have we got any help 
from engineering yet? We need 
more effective firepower.” 

“They’re working on some ex- 
plosives but I don’t think it’ll help us 
soon enough. Here they come 
again. ” 

“Well, if we can hold them off 
this time, they should have an hour 



or two before the next attack. That 

is, if the pattern holds. Will that be 
enough time to finish?” The Col- 
onel drew his side arm and waited. 

“It had better be. Our reports 
show that new tribes are joining 
them every few minutes. They 
could double in numbers in the next 
three hours.” 

The first shots quickly turned into 
hundreds, as the Toppers came into 
range. 

* * * 

The battle was audible just min- 
utes before the Settlement came into 
view. Blair stopped the worg in the 
tall brush at the edge of the clearing 
and waited for orders. 

Captain Gatis watched a moment, 
then gave quick instructions. The 
worg responded to Blair’s skilled 
hands and moved around the low 
rolling hills toward the huge space 
craft. 

“Keep to the low ground until 
you get close, Blair. We’ll be hid- 
den by the Intrepid as we move in. 
They’re not attacking that side 
yet. ’ ’ 

“Surprise will be the key element 
in our favor,” Carlston said. “If 
those three-eyed baboons see us 
coming, they’ll try to stop us. And 
from the numbers I’ve seen, they 
probably could if they worked at 

it. ” 

“When you reach the Intrepid, 
Blair, tum her out and circle the 
camp. Run right through the middle 
of them. We have to get as many as 
possible on that first run. Carlston, 
have the men fire from the side 
ports.” 

By the time the worg reached the 

19 



PARASITE 




ship, the Toppers were within yards 
of the defenses. The huge ship pro- 
vided enough cover to allow an ac- 
celerated approach. As they broke 
from cover, the worg was nearing 
100 kilometers per hour. The mas- 
sive creature’s appearance had the 
desired effect. The Toppers nearest 
the barricades stopped their advance 
and turned to consider the new 
threat. The momentary delay be- 
tween the worg’s appearance and its 
reaching the first groups of attackers 
served to concentrate them in its 
path. 

Surprise was replaced by confu- * 
sion. Confusion by panic .... And 
in the wake of panic came death. 

As Blair guided the worg around 
the Settlement, the shock wave of 
panic preceded them. Behind 
them, a scarlet strip of ground bore 
record of their passing. 

With the circle two-thirds com- 
plete, Blair turned the worg to make 
another run. 

“Captain, look!” The worg 
slowed abruptly as Blair viewed the 
terrain before them. “They’re 
gone ! ’ ’ 

Across the rolling countryside, 
the Toppers could be seen fleeing. 
The near ground was littered with 
clubs and stones dropped in their 
flight. 

“Captain?” Blair repeated. 

“I don’t get it either, Blair. What 
do you think, Carlslon?” 

“I don’t know, Sir. We killed a 
good number of them, two or three 
thousand, I’d say. But I’ve never 
seen them act that scared.” The 
Sergeant turned from the port to 
face the other two. "That group we 
hit earlier put up more of a fight 
than this. It doesn’t make sense.” 



“I know. As much as I hate 
Toppers, I’ve got to give them 
credit for one thing. They’re always 
ready for a fight. I agree, it doesn’t 
make sense. Blair, take a wide run 
around, just to be sure they're all 
leaving. Then drop us off near the 
Colonel ’s office. ” 

V 

“What did the computer report 
tell you, Major?” 

Major Mattson, with a file of 
printouts in his hand, had just en- 
tered the Colonel’s office. He 
glanced quickly around, smiling and 
nodding at the small assembly of 
officers. 

“Gentlemen.” He greeted them, 
then turned to the Colonel’s desk. 
“Not much, Sir. Here’s the print- 
out.” 

“Did we get all the reports’ input? 
Sentries, Worg Captains, every- 
thing?” 

“Yes, Sir. But the computer 
reaches no definite conclusions 
about the attacks. There is some in- 
dication that the Toppers have been 
spending more time out of the trees 
and that they have been forming in 
large groups — councils, you might 
say — for a few weeks now. The 
size of the groups seems to be on 
the increase.” 

The Colonel’s face was grave. He 
paused momentarily before asking 
the next question but it was asked 
for him before he could speak. 

“Can we expect another attack?” 
It was Captain Snell who leaned 
forward and put the thoughts to 
words. 

“We don’t know,” the Major an- 
swered. “The ship’s computer notes 



20 



GALAXY 




ull sorts of behavior changes in the 
Toppers but the attacks seemed un- 
• provoked and without reason. The 
whole affair makes little sense. 
Here, Colonel, look at this.” Major 
Mattson pointed at one of the 
printout sheets. 

“Yes, 1 know, we lost twenty 
men. So?” 

"Sir, we should have lost more 
than forty!” 

“What?” 

"See the projections here and 
here? They indicate that we should 
have lost forty men during the first 
three attacks. By the fourth they 
should have overrun us.” 

“Based on what?” 

“Based on the number of Top- 
|K'rs, our defenses and their accu- 
racy at rock throwing.” 

“They have that,” Captain Gatis 
interjected. “I’ve seen those three- 
eyed monkeys knock birds down at 
fifty meters or more, apparently just 
lor sport. ” 

“And here’s another point. Sir,” 
the Major drew the attention again 
lo the file. “The amount of damage 
to the shelters was exceptionally 
high, ” 

“Maybe the computer hasn’t 
drawn a conclusion yet, Major, but I 
get the impression that you have. 
Ixt’s have it.” The Colonel sat 
hack in his chair, as he waited for 
the reply. 

“Well, I have half a conclusion. 
The reason for the low casualties, I 
think, is that they weren’t after us.” 
The Major’s words were apologetic 
in tone. 

“Then what were they after?” 

“They seemed bent on destroy- 
ing” — he stumbled on the 
words — “the Settlement, Sir. I 



think they wanted to bust up the 
shelters. But I can’t figure why.” 
“And how is Doc Hyotte com- 
ing? Any word from his work with 
the group we penned up?” 

“Well,” the Major began slowly, 
“some. And it doesn’t make sense, 
either. He says they’re acting 
strange. Jumpy and almost . well, 
he used the word ‘terrified.’ ” 
“Terrified? Is it their wounds? 
Perhaps the drugs we’ve used?” 
“No, Sir, he said he’s checked all 
that. And . guess what seems to 
scare them silly?” 

“Major! This is not a guessing 
game!” 

“Sorry, Sir. It’s just so odd . 
It’s worgs, Sir. When Captain Gatis 
came back from prospecting, he 
scattered the group attacking us. 
Then later, when he came into the 
camp, he passed the cage we set up 
for Doc Hyotte. We thought the 
Toppers were going to tear it down 
to get away.” 

“How many were in the cage?” 
Captain Snell asked. 

“Eighteen, Captain.” 

“Eighteen? I’ve seen groups of 
ten attack a worg.” 

“Yes, Captain, so have I. As I 
said, they’re acting strangely.” 
“Well, gentlemen,” the Colonel 
eased his bandaged arm onto the 
desk, “I don’t think we’ve heard 
the last of this yet. Based on what 
we have up to now, we’d better 
keep the worgs out on patrol. Keep 
an eye on the Toppers and perhaps 
capitalize on this newborn fear they 
have of the worgs. Report every 
few hours to the ship-board com- 
puter officer. Report at once if you 
find anything strange or any an- 
swers to our questions. Dismissed.”

Sergeant Carlston made his way 
slowly down the outer passageway. 
Three times he bumped into the 
larger fibrils as his eyes concen- 
trated on the data before him. Fi- 
nally. he reached his quarters (an 
eight-by-ten-foot cubicle cut from 
the waxy cells of the worg’s inte- 
rior) and dropped onto the bunk. 
The bunk was carved into the very 
walls of the cubicle. The gelatinous 
cell material yielded slightly to his 
weight as he settled down. 

Carlston was now alone on the 
worg. The Toppers’ retreat had 
been permanent. Not only had they 
not renewed the attack but all re- 
ports indicated that they had with- 
drawn completely into the forest, 
hiding in apparent terror among the 
tops of the ponders. The I.R. Scan- 
ners found nothing in the area. 

Back in the Settlement, the Doc- 
tor worked at making sense of the 
Toppers’ dramatic psychological 
change. The worg crews had been 
given time off. but the worgs them- 
selves, with only one or two experi- 
enced men aboard, were left to pa- 
trol the edges of the wood. 

Carlston had used the solitude to 
gather more data on this bug, this 
strange bug. As dusk came, he set 
automatic controls to keep the worg 
in a slow, steady grazing path 
around the Settlement. The I.R. 
Scanner alarm was set in case con- 
ditions changed but he didn’t expect 
them to tonight. 

Now, as he lay on the bunk, a 
peaceful weariness built from the 
trying hours of the long day crept 
over hfm. The file slipped slowly to 
the floor as sleep came. 



Hours passed, how many he did 
not know. He awakened fitfully, as 
from a nightmare, fighting imagi- 
nary demons who spun nets to trap 
him in his dreams. As his arm 
reached out, a pang of terror struck 
deeply within his sleep-dimmed 
mind. 

While the demons were of the 
dream, the nets were not. All 
around him he could feel and see 
the strands. The entire cubicle was 
filled with an eerie glow, as the 
light from the wall hung beam 
struck and reflected from ten 
thousand tiny fibers. The walls, 
formerly waxen and sullen, now 
seemed alive. Slender tentacles 
reached out across space to join 
others. The cubicle and passageway 
beyond were filling with the web. 

Darkness came to the room as the 
beam fell from the moving wall and 
rolled like a snowball into a sphere 
of white fiber. 

Carlston fought to free himself 
from the bunk which held him fast. 
With his free hand, he was finally 
able to reach his knife. With chop- 
ping mutions, he freed the other, 
then his feet. 

Even in the dark, he could sense 
the motion about him. The cell was 
mending its wound, tying itself to- 
gether, knitting new fabric to re- 
place the old. 

Long minutes passed as Carlston 
hacked away with the blade. Fi- 
nally, he had room to stand, to stop 
for a moment, to gather his wits. 
Frantically, his mind searched the 
huge worg Where was a wrist 
beam? Where were the cutting 
tools? What was happening? 



22 



GALAXY 




The wall beam! If he could reach 
it, he would at least have light. 

As he cut his way slowly through 
the fibers which surrounded him, 
hits of information filtered into his 
bruin. The worg was silent. Deadly 
silent. The usual crunching of the 
grazing mandibles was gone. In its 
place was, not an audible sound, 
nut the sensation of a slow, pulsing, 
throbbing motion. 

The floor beneath him, the tough 
inner skin of the leg muscles, was 
no longer flat. It bulged and con- 
torted and curved strangely. 

A glow. A few feet ahead, he 
could see a faint glow. The wall 
beam! Wrapped in a tangled mass 
of the web and wedged between 
two twists of the floor, it glowed 
dimly through its new casing. 

In a few minutes, he had freed it. 
Now he could see. But what he saw 
brought no comfort. He was in a 
cave, a cave of his own making, 
perhaps six feet in length and large 
enough to crouch in. 

He tested the fibrous wall around 
him. “Like the inside of a ball of 
cotton," he thought. It yielded to 
the pressure of his hand, only to 
spring back into place when re- 
leased. It cut fairly easily with the 
small knife but progress through it 
would be slow. 

A plan formed. Mentally, he had 
located the larger tools, the tools he 
would need to get out of this bug. 
“A strange bug indeed,” the words 
gnawed at his mind. 

As his hands tore and cut through 
the web-filled cubicle, he plotted 
the shortest route to the tool chest. 
It would take hours! 

The comer of the doorway 
brought a sense of relief. The 

PARASITE 



passageway seemed less dense than 
his cubicle and further growth from 
the walls had slowed. The doorway 
provided a reference point. He cut 
his way out into the aisle. 

His relief was only temporary, 
however, as a new sensation 
reached him. The floor beneath him 
tremored slightly, then hardened. 

The convulsion came suddenly, 
tossing Carlston into the fluffy web 
above him. He was thrown about 
violently in his cottony coffin. Only 
the softness of his cage prevented 
severe injury. 

It lasted only seconds; then, as 
quickly as it began, it stopped. 
Carlston lay on his back. The lan- 
tern had broken free from his grip. 
Twice, maybe three times, in the 
melee it had struck him about the 
head. Now it lay on the cottony sur- 
face near his leg. 

As he rolled over and reached for 
it, the beam played on the floor 
which now rose like a wall beside 
him. 

Beside him? The worg had rolled 
over! The floor was now a curving 
wall and the spongy, cottony wall 
of the passageway lay beneath him. 

* * * 

Dawn came in its usual slow 
pace. The worgs, with their skeleton 
crews, returned to the settlement. 
All but one. 

Hours later, the beasts were fully 
manned and a search pattern was 
under way. 

For hours the search went on. 
Once during the day a crew passed 
within several yards of a swampy 
marsh. A green, cottony, moss-like 
growth covered part of one shore. 

23 




Beneath it in the water and mud, 
the huge worg lay curled into a 
giant ball. And within the worg, 
one solitary, lonely man cut desper- 
ately away at his prison. 

Vll 

Carlston reached the tool case at 
dusk. Three times during the long 
day, he had slept for short periods, 
collapsing from near exhaustion. 
Several times, he cut thin slivers of 
muscle from the floor beside him, 
to chew on as he worked. Even 
raw, the tissue tasted good and pro- 
vided needed energy. 

With the larger tools, he pro- 
ceeded with relative ease toward the 
control room. With them, he could 
stand and cut his way through the 
web. 

For many hours there had been 
no motion, no sound, nothing sig- 
naling that any life was left in the 
giant beast. If he could reach the 
control desk and check the records, 
he would at least have some evi- 
dence of where he was and how to 
return to the settlement. And he 
should be able to get out through 
one of the enlarged ports, or cut a 
new one if need be. 

As he neared the control room, 
he could hear water trickling slowly 
through the ports. Only then did he 
realize that the worg was under wa- 
ter. The mesh of webbing inside 
and outside the ports had sealed 
them almost completely. 

The webbing seemed to fall away 
more easily now, as Carlston en- 
tered the control room. He worked 
his way across the room toward the 
desk. It extended awkwardly from 
the convoluted floor. 

24 



Carlston cut and tore the webbing 
away from the desk. It felt wet in 
his hands as he pulled it from the 
cabinet. “Moisture from the ports,” 
he thought, then dismissed the error 
as he stared at the mass of webbing 
in his hand. It was melting! 

All around him the webbing 
withdrew. Flowing slowly toward 
the wall of muscle, the fibrous mass 
was alive again! 

He watched in stunned fascina- 
tion as the room emptied itself. 
Frustration near to anger flooded 
through him as he saw the central 
passageway behind him re-open. 
The narrow slit cut so painfully 
from the web, now opened to the 
former walls. Then the walls them- 
selves began to flow toward the 
fibrous floor. 

The next several minutes brought 
a new series of convulsions. With 
what was left of his sapped energy. 
Carlston clung to the desk as the 
worg began to move. 

The water had stopped flowing. 

The floor was again beneath his 
feet. 

The worg was out of the water 
and upright. 

The ports were nearly clear. Faint 
moonlight filtered through the re- 
maining fibers. 

A strange pulsing vibration born 
of massive ' energy permeated 
Carlston and everything around 
him. 

Then he felt a sensation known 
only to those few privileged enough 
to free themselves from Earth’s 
friendly grasp. A sensation which 
he had not felt for some four years. 

Freefall ! 

He was airborne! 

Metamorphosis! That was the 
GALAXY 





tffiM 



missing factor. This beast of bur- 
den, this creature of ever predic- 
table habit which he thought he had 
grown to understand over the past 
years, had a different side to it. 

The passion of new knowledge 
replaced the terror of the moments 
before and Carlston fought his way 
toward the port. The moving mus- 
cles beneath him tripped and tossed 
him as he stumbled to the opening. 

Below him, the moonlit marsh 
floated slowly away. A circle of 
discarded plates could be seen at its 
edge, slowly sinking into the marsh. 
Above him were the stars and in the 
distance to the left, he could see the 
lights of the Settlement. 

“How?” he wondered aloud. 
“How can this thing possibly fly?” 
With the security of the hard 
carapace restoring his confidence, 
he thrust himself partly through the 



port. Twisting to get a better view, 
he saw hundreds of gauzy, glisten- 
ing wings reflecting the moonlight. 

The body was now long and 
slender, less than a tenth of its orig- 
inal volume. With the outer shells 
cast off, each segment sported three 
pairs of huge wings which moved 
with amazing speed and grace. 

The former slab of muscle which 
had moved those gigantic feet was 
now swollen with the absorbed 
energy of the fatty cells. 

Like a dragonfly of enormous and 
grotesque proportions, the worg flit- 
ted toward the clouds. 

Carlston watched . fascinated 
as it rose higher. Soon even the 
enormous ponders were several 
hundred feet below. The worg 
moved toward the edge of the 
woods, closing quickly on the tree 
tops. 



PARASITE 



25 




Branches brushed close to the 
port as the worg hovered 
momentarily. Carlston ducked back 
inside, closely avoiding being 
knocked from the port by a six-inch 
‘twig’ of the massive tree. 

As the worg rose again, Carlston 
could see the gaping hole in the tree 
top left by a moment’s ‘browsing.’ It 
was nighttime and the worg had re- 
sumed his feeding. 

Carlston watched as the worg 
stopped again and again to tease its 
voracious appetite. He moved to the 
left port to get another view. Off in 
the distance, he could see the lights 
of the Settlement. 

Fully a half hour passed as 
Carlston watched in helpless fasci- 
nation the scene which unfolded be- 
fore him. Behind and beneath and 
around him was this “strange bug” 
which now held him captive. Out of 
the ports, he could see the massive 
woods and the clearing, hundreds of 
meters below. Above, the twin 
moons and stars. Off in the distance 
to his left, the glow of the Settle- 
ment. 

Off to the left? Always to the 
left?! 

The worg was circling the clear- 
ing! Circling in the same pattern as 
it had grazed the ground far below, 
the night before! 

The controls! They were still 
working! The muscles which moved 
the feet and the nerves which con- 
trolled those muscles must be the 
same as those which now moved 
those huge, filmy wings. 

Instinct moved the worg to feed. 
The nerve controls of the computer 
could still control, no, they were 
still controlling its direction. 

Carlston lunged for the console. 



In elation, he gazed at the controls 
and studied the readouts. Balance 
was difficult. As the worg stopped 
to feed, then rose again, Carlston 
tore off his shirt and tied it to his 
belt. Then to the console. 

“Now,” he said, grasping the 
main panel. “How do we fly this 
thing?” 

VIII 

When the worg landed at the Set- 
tlement, it was almost dawn. Com- 
ing in high and then straight down, 
almost like a helicopter, Carlston 
had been able to avoid the sentries 
and possible armed resistance. The 
expected reaction came, but he had 
time to make his own presence 
known before the community 
moved to resist this new “inva- 
sion.” 

Twice during the night he had 
had to make new nerve connections. 
With the new connections, he had 
achieved full third-dimensional con- 
trol, so important to the ultimate 
handling of the creature. 

* ★ * 

Wearily, he finished explaining 
the controls to Blair. 

“It only takes three or four 
days,” he mumbled. 

“What?” Blair asked. 

“The metamorphosis, ” Carlston 
explained groggily. “Three or four 
days for the complete change.” 

“Oh. yeah!” Blair answered, 
half as a question. 

“C’mon, Blair, the others! You’ll 
have to make the changes now. 
They could change any day.” 

“The other worgs!” The impact 
of Carlston ’s reasoning broke 



26 



GALAXY 




through to Blair. "Of course, the 
others. If this one goes through 
these changes, they all must.’’ 

‘‘Corporal Blair,” Captain Gatis 
broke into the control room. “The 
Colonel just told me that three worg 
crews have reported metabolic 
changes in their worgs. Do you 
suppose they’re all going to change? 
Into .... into this?” 

“What do you think. Sergeant?” 
Smiling, Blair turned toward 
Carls ton. 

Sergeant Carlston leaned heavily 
ugainst the port, his face illuminated 
by the rising sun. 

He didn’t answer. 

He was asleep. 

* ★ * 

Within two weeks, eight captive 
worgs had gone through the 
metamorphosis. The crews had 
adapted quickly and since the flying 
worg could hold only four crewmen 
comfortably, they had captured sev- 
eral new ones for a doubled force. 

“When will the detectors be 
ready. Major?” The Colonel made 
notes as each officer present re- 
ported his progress. 

"Tomorrow, Sir.” 

"And the crews will be ready, 
too. We should be able to cover 
twenty to thirty times the area per 
day we did by ground crews. If 
there’s any iron ore within five 
thousand kilometers, we should find 
it in the next few months.” 

“If the worgs last that long, 
Sir,” Captain Gatis injected. 

“Captain?” the Colonel looked 
puzzled-. 

“Well, Carlston has projected 
various phases of the metabolic 



changes. His work to now predicts 
certain critical effects in four to six 
weeks.” 

“Meaning?” 

“He’s not sure. The best guess 
right now is based on comparisons 
with other life-forms, both here and 
on Earth.” The Captain paused. 
“The worgs are like our insects. 
Their very make-up should have 
suggested the possibility of a 
metamorphosis to us before. If the 
analogy is correct, this new form is 
the breeding stage.” He paused 
again. 

‘ ‘Go on . ” 

“The problem is time, Sir. 
We've been here for four years. 
We’ve seen no major changes in the 
worgs ’til now. That means they’ve 
got a long life span. If they breed, 
lay eggs or whatever, and die, like 
insects do. 

‘‘Then we’ll have no worgs?” 

“Exactly,” the Captain con- 
tinued, “and no way of predicting 
how long it will be ’til we have 
more.” 

“What about the four-to-six-week 
crisis?” the Major asked. 

“Carlston thinks six weeks will 
bring the mating season. After that, 
well, present food input and energy 
output indicate a below-sustenance 
level within eight, maybe nine, 
weeks.” 

“Major,” the Colonel started to 
speak but was anticipated by the 
Major. 

“Yes, Sir, the detectors will be 
ready tonight. I’ll see to it. Sir.” 

As the Major left. Doctor Hyotte 
stepped away from the window and 
toward the Colonel’s desk. 

“Colonel, I think I’ve got those 
attacks by the Toppers figured 



PARASITE

out.” The doctor paused briefly, 
then turned back toward the win- 
dow. ‘‘I think it was instinctive, 
too.” 

“How’s that?” 

“Look at the forest. In the last 
three days, our worgs have almost 
stripped this area. They eat all night 
and all day now. In a month, they 
could destroy this entire forest area. 
The Toppers weren’t after us, they 
were after these shells. ” The doctor 
gestured to the curved ceiling above 
them. “They sensed that the worgs 
were getting ready to change. They 
thought, or instinct told them, that if 
they could kill the worgs. they 
could save their homes.” 

“And the Settlement looked 
like ..." 

“Like what it is, dozens of 
worgs. All in one easily attacked 
spot. Out in the open, not half 
buried in some swamp the way they 
normally spend their sleeping 
hours.” 

“Except these are dead!” Captain 
Gatis retorted. 

“Yes. but live worgs, with 
crews, moved in and out every day. 
The Toppers had no way of telling 
which was which. ” 

“Then why did they panic when 
my crew came back?” the Captain 
asked, leaning forward in his chair. 

“Your worg was already well 
into the change. It was a real 
danger to them. And to their young 
at home.” 

“So they ran home to save the 
kids?” 

“Well?” the doctor looked from 
the Colonel to the Captain and 
back. 

After a thoughtful pause, the 
Colonel answered. 



“It makes sense. Maybe, if we 
don’t find that iron, we’ll hang 
around and see it all again, next cy- 
cle.” 

“Yes, maybe.” 

The group laughed together, but 
the humor held a touch of serious 
concern. 

IX 

Only two hours after they had left 
camp, the first crew returned to the 
Settlement. Captain Snell dropped to 
the ground and stormed angrily into 
the Technical Compound. 

“Who put that piece of junk to- 
gether?” 

Major Mattson turned to meet 
the affront. “What’s your problem. 
Snell?” 

“That detector you gave us. It’s 
lousy.” 

“Doesn’t it give you any read- 
ings?” 

“Ooooh yes, we get readings. 
We get constant readings. It’s too 
sensitive!” 

“Calm down. Captain,” the 
Major answered soothingly. “Bring 
it in. The engineers can adjust it in 
a few minutes." 

“It’s on its way in.” 

“Good. Let’s go cool down and 
get a cup, shall we?" 

“I'm sorry, Matt, I — ” the Cap- 
tain began to apologize. 

“C’mon, let’s get a cup.” 

* * * 

“Excuse me, Major.” It was 
twenty minutes later when the 
young Engineer approached the 
table where the Major and Captain 
Snell sat. 

“Yes, is the detector ready?” 



28 



GALAXY 




“Well, yes, Sir, it is but . .’’he 
said, hesitating. 

“But what?” 

“Well, there’s two things. Sir. 
There wasn’t anything wrong with 
(he detector . and ...” 

“And?” 

“And we have three more crews 
hack with the same complaint.” 

* * * 

Within an hour all the crews were 
back. Within an hour, all the detec- 
tors were sitting on a large table in 
the engineering section, surrounded 
by the officers of each crew and 
one very distraught Colonel. 

“Let me get this straight. 
Matt!” As the Colonel spoke, the 
others fell silent. “You say the de- 
tectors all check out here, with your 
people?” 

“Yes. ” 

“But the worg crews can’t handle 
them?” 

“Well, not exactly, Sir. They 
check out here, no matter who han- 
dles them. Our engineers or the 
crews. But they seem to be useless 
aboard the worgs.” 

“Why?” 

"I don’t know. ” 

Silence. Then from the edge of 
the room, Carlston’s voice broke in. 

“Topper’s Blood.” 

“What? What did you say 
t 'artston?” The Colonel’s voice ear- 
ned a tone of threat. 

“I said, ‘Topper’s Blood.’ ” 

“Carlston, if you’re trying to be 
tunny ...” 

“No, Sir,” he answered as he 
moved toward the table. “Hear me 
mil. Captain Gatis, do you re- 
member the argument between Blair 



and Lieutenant Dixon about Top- 
per’s blood?” 

“Yes,” the Captain responded. 
“Blair said something about the 
Topper’s blood probably having a 
lot of iron ... to be so red?” 

“That’s the one. Dixon con- 
tended that if there were any heavy 
ores, it would have to be deep, too 
deep for us to get to. But the ques- 
tion still remained of the Topper’s 
red blood. Where do they get their 
iron from?” 

“So?” 

“Now the detectors give ‘falsely’ 
high readings every time we take 
them on the worgs.” 

“The ponders!” the Major’s 
words struck home. 

“That's it,” Carlston agreed. 
“The Toppers have iron in their 
blood. The worgs now have iron in 
their intestines. Iron from the leaves 
of those trees. Those ponders run 
four to five hundred meters high. 
Their roots could go down twice 
that far, who knows?” 

“What kind of concentration can 
it be. Matt?” The Colonel reentered 
the conversation. "Can we refine 
it?” 

"It’s organic. All we have to do 
is bum it off. ” 

“It’s got to be high enough to 
register on the meters,” Carlston in- 
jected. “Otherwise, we wouldn’t be 
in this meeting, would we?” 

“Each worg consumes tons per 
hour. Sir.” The Major expounded 
on the theme. “It’s probably more 
concentrated in the waste than in 
the leaves themselves. If it’s a few 
tenths of a percent, we can get hun- 
dreds of pounds a day, from each 
one.” 

The group broke into a buzz of 

29 



I'ARASITE 




excitement. Two engineers talking 
with Major Mattson grabbed detec- 
tors and ran out the door. They re- 
turned a minute later with broad 
grins. One spoke. 

“It checks, Major. Both detectors 
give identical readings. The worgs 
are flying ore deposits.” 

“Hmmm. By the way, 
Carlston.” The Colonel turned to- 
ward the Sergeant, a frown wrin- 
kling his face. “This meeting was 
called for, uh, ‘officers.’ Might I 
ask what yon are doing here?” 

“Well, Sir, I . .” Carlston 
backed away slightly from the Col- 
onel's stare. 

“Captain Gatis!” The Colonel 
snapped as he turned away from 
Carlston. 

“Yes, Sir?” 

“Why don’t you see what you 
can do about this situation!” 

Catching the twinkle in the Col- 
onel’s eye, the Captain grinned 
broadly as he answered. “Ahh, yes, 
Sir! I think a promotion is in or- 
der. ” 

Epilogue 

“Well, how does it look. Doc?” 
Major Mattson asked. “Is he going 
to live?” 

The doctor carefully removed the 
last of the bandages from the Col- 
onel’s arm. 

“1 think so,” he quipped back. 

“When we get back to Earth, 1 
think I’ll change doctors,” the Col- 
onel mused under his breath. Then, 
still barely audible, he continued, 
“and maybe technical officers, 
too. ” 

“Ouch! That hurt,” the Major 
mimicked pain at the response. 

30 



“Seriously, Sir, are you going to 
grant Captain Gatis ’s request?” 

“I think so ... he and Carlston 
deserve some special reward, but I 
don’t know if staying here till we 
return is reward or punishment. 
They’ve got several others who 
want to stay, too. Good men, every 
one of them. Carlston wants to fol- 
low the worgs - life cycle clear 
through. Plus the T uppers and 
several other creatures they have in 
mind. It should be of tremendous 
help to future colonization.” 

“Colonel, could you please hold 
still! This arm is healing nicely but 
if you keep twisting around, I’ll 
never get it cleaned up. " 

“Okay, Doc." The Colonel 
laughed and turned to continue his 
discussion with the Major. 

But the surgeon interrupted again. 
“A-hah! What have we here?” 
“Huh? . Ouch!” the Colonel 
winced. 

The doctor held a small, squirm- 
ing thing at the end of a pair of 
Iwcczcrs 

“What’s that. Doc?” The Major 
reached over to take the tweezers 
from the surgeon’s hand. 

“Just a little parasite we’ve 
picked up here.” the doctor replied 
in an unconcerned manner as he re- 
turned to dressing the wound. 
“They gel into almost any new 
wound. Apparently feed on the 
scab. ” 

“Hmmm," the Major mused as 
he held the tiny parasite. “Kinda 
like we Iced on the worgs, huh. 
Colonel - ” Tossing the squirming 
dot toward the doorway, he stared 
after it as it slowly crawled away. 
“I wonder what he really 
wants?” ★

You know you’re going crazy when 
you start talking to yourself. 

But when you hear an answer 



My feet are cold. What an ab- 
surd thing to notice in the middle of 
committing suicide. 

The cellar is very dark, and this 
comer of it is hidden behind the ref- 
use of a decade’s experiments. The 
carrion-sniffers of this world will 
not search here for a long time, and 
even when they do, they won’t un- 
derstand what they find. 

Light short years and two long 
ones have passed since 1 consigned 
the Transporter to this silent comer. 
In all that time I have mentioned it 
to no one. The notes on its con- 
struction are in a separate, secret 
tile. In theory, it should sunder the 
bonds of reality; a cosmic hat trick; 
place the rabbit on the grille, and 
watch it vanish into another proba- 
ble existence! But I have never been 
able to bring the rabbit back. 
I’erhaps 1 was wrong from the start. 
I’erhaps there is no other branch to 
leap to in this tree of events. 
I’erhaps I have only invented some- 
thing which quietly disintegrates 
matter. Ah, the useless speculations 



I have indulged in over the years, 
trying to fathom this engine, know- 
ing it was useless — and danger- 
ous — as it stood. 

But now, as I shiver in my cold 
cellar, it seems to me that 1 kept it 
secret for reasons I could not have 
guessed. I think that I knew I would 
need it someday. A sad and terrible 
foresight, if so. 

Helene . 

That woman! I cry, I rage . 

Every man has his uncontrollable 
fascinations. I have never been able 
to deal rationally with Teutonic wo- 
men, particularly those of a Wagne- 
rian aura, young to my middle- 
age, tail to my short, each strong 
as a mail-clad Valkyrie. Helene was 
like that. Not unflawed, for she had 
grown up in Sweden, not her native 
Germany, but the resultant unlikely 
accent and audacity of stance only 
excited me more. They gave her the 
illusion of accessibility. 

We met two years ago at a boring 
party. Her father’s cartel was at- 



DUET 



33 




tempting to hire me, and she, ob- 
viously, was the bait. I admired this 
ruthlessness in her father; he knew 
me, knew my weaknesses. He 
would do what he had to to achieve 
his end. That he would go so far as 
using his own daughter to entice me 
was intensely gratifying. 

1 assumed at first that our “court- 
ship” would run along predictable 
lines. There would be several weeks 
of delightful pursuit and then the 
ecstatic capture, followed in short 
order by boredom, and then I would 
leave. She and her father would 
discover that 1 could be ruthless, 
too. But I was wrong, so very 
wrong. Instead, she remained out of 
my reach, close but far away, say- 
ing one thing and doing another 
until my head spun. Without actu- 
ally noticing the transition, I became 
like the unfortunates duped by a 
stage hypnotist, hunching their 
shoulders and scratching like chick- 
ens on command, totally oblivious 
to their folly. 

Three times in two years I have 
tried to leave her, but she always 
tempted me back. I could not say 

no. 

I loved her. I can’t say why. 1 
love her even now. 

And then, this morning, I gave 
in. I thought: I will give her every- 
thing of me. I took the train to the 
city, going first to her father’s 
Manhattan offices, where an assist- 
ant cheerfully guided me through a 
maze of contracts and hidden 
clauses. I signed away my crea- 
tions. They hardly mattered when 
all I dreamed of was signing over 
my life to Helene. I was in a frenzy 
when I finally found her, in a pub 
on 66th Street we had often eaten 



in. She was with an impossibly 
handsome young man. When she 
saw me, she sent him away with a 
smile and a light kiss on the cheek. 

Her smile for me was exactly the 
same. Wary, but somehow inviting. 

“This is a surprise, Joseph. I 
wasn’t expecting you to emerge 
from your den and spirit me away 
until tomorrow night. Don’t bother 
to be jealous of Roy — an old friend, 
but we owe each other nothing.” 
Her hand trailed gently over the 
back of mine. 

I told her everything. That 1 
loved her (which I had said before, 
to no practical effect). That to prove 
my love I was giving up my world 
for her. 

She laughed callously. “Papa will 
be glad to hear that you’ve finally 
given in to the siege.” 

“I didn’t do it for your father — I 
did it for you! I gave up every- 
thing!” 

Her eyes flashed acidly. “Am 1 
to be flattered? To be loved in the 
manner of a schoolboy by an old 
lecher? Go away, little man. I got 
what I wanted.” 

That was three hours ago. The 
pain is worse now. 

I am shivering on the grillework, 
my feet bared for better contact 
with the field. It took little effort, 
after actually reaching my decision, 
to juryrig a control that could be ac- 
tivated from within the Transporter 
itself. 

She used me. Used Joseph Ar- 
gos, honored and respected, a self- 
made man — not an ancient fool, but 
a man! 

But then, I had allowed her to 
use me, hadn’t I? What kind of 
man does that?

There is nothing left for it but to 
call the curtain down. I shift my 
shoes and socks from one hand to 
the other so that I can press the con- 
trol. 

Nothing, at first. And then, at the 
very edge of sight, a trembling of 
shadows. 

They begin to whirl, grey as the 
ghosts of memory. Bright colors 
peek through their curtain. Suddenly 
I am in a cylinder of screaming 
light; it shatters my sight, dislocates 
my reason. A roar sweeps up from 
all sides, drowning me, as I lock 
out my awareness of the pain and 
whisper, not to my life but to her; 
goodbye . 

* * * 

When I come back to conscious- 
ness, I am still in the cellar. Worse 
than that. I am still alive. 

I am crying silently over that sad 
fact, admitting to myself that I lack 
the courage for a more conventional 
form of self-murder, when some 
analytical part of my mind that has 
been frozen ever since Helene’s 
laughter clicks back into place. 

My cellar had walls of red brick. 
These walls are concrete. 

The realization comes that sim- 
ply. 

1 can’t help it; I start to laugh. 

Immediately an angry voice 
echoes back from the other side of 
the cellar. “Who is that? Who has 
broken into my home!’’ The 
speaker is out of sight behind a 
tumble of packing crates, but I 
know who it must be. I have been 
hearing that voice on my taped 
notes for years. 



“Calm down, Argos. It’s only 
yourself, come blindly in search of 
heaven or hell. Or plain death. 
Which is this, anyway?” 

“Well,” he answers, stepping 
into view, “this is a surprise.” 
The light behind him throws his 
shadow at the foot of the Transpor- 
ter. I cannot see his face, but I can 
feel his cool appraisal of me. It is 
much calmer than mine would be 
were our positions reversed. “So 
the device does deliver its burden 
alive, and — I presume — functioning 
as well. I never was sure, test ani- 
mals being unrecoverable. Pleas- 
ing.” 

“Yes and no.” 

“Any dizziness? Pains? This is 
an invaluable chance to learn more 
of the Transporter’s effects. How far 
have you come?” 

“Not very, it seems. But how 
much can I tell from a cellar? In 
fact, how to measure the differences 
between universes at all? You take 
quantitative, I’ll take qualitative, 
and we can have a hell of an argu- 
ment.” 

“You are in rather an uncom- 
municative mood.” 

“Put yourself in my place,” I 
say, and only then realize how 
baroquely funny the phrase is in this 
context. “No, don’t bother. You 
wouldn’t like it. I’m cold, and hun- 
gry, and depressed. I’m perfectly 
willing to talk — what else is there to 
do? — but after I take care of the 
first two.” I sit down and start to 
put on my shoes. He blinks at me, 
owlish behind his glasses (which are 
bifocal, just like mine) as he takes 
his own internal counsel. 

“All right. Please stay down here 
for a time; there is a couch you may 



DUET 



35 




use. There are blankets. I will bring 
you some hot food.” 

He invites me down with a ges- 
ture both polite and subtly denigrat- 
ing, then leads me to a ragged 
couch covered over with a dusty 
brown army blanket. 

In my home it was not a new 
couch, but it was not this ragged. 

No matter. 

He turns to leave. Pauses. Turns 
around and faces me once more. 
“Just remember; this is my home.” 
And then he is gone. 

* * Hr 

After a time I hear shouting up- 
stairs, muffled by wood and metal 
and stone. The voice is clearly my 
double’s. There is another voice, 
painfully familiar, but it is never 
raised in anger. I cannot tell what 
either actually says. 

* * * 

“Argos ... it feels odd, refer- 
ring to you with my name.” 

I sip my soup. It is now cold; he 
had brought it .to me lukewarm. 
“It’s my name, too.” 

“Our name, then. This will take 
some getting used to. We are Dop- 
peigangers, like out of legend.” 

I hope not. Seeing him in a clear 
light is disturbing. Surely 1 do not 
look so old, so ugly. It is hard to 
believe that he is my age, a mere 
forty-eight. And there is an ill- 
defined light of fanaticism in his 
eyes. If I weren’t so depressed over 
my own lot, I might be worried for 
his. 

“Why did you take this chance?” 



he asks, his eyes sharp as a 
goshawk’s. “I am suspicious of 
you. This talk of depression, this 
self-pity. It is unmanly. So tell me, 
why did you use the Transporter? 
Don't say 'for science.’ I would 
like to believe such a fiction, but I 
can't.. Not in any world would I be 
that foolish.” 

“Are you always this abrasive? 
You must have even fewer friends 
than I did.” 

“Facile, answering my question 
with one of your own.” 

I sigh. “I have been blindly 
stupid for two full years and you 
expect me to be able to sum them 
up in an elegant epigram? Don’t be 
an ass. There are only three practi- 
cal things I have gained from this 
experience, all of which I am glad 
to pass on. One, never sign your 
work away, no matter the provoca- 
tion. It isn’t worth it. Two, for the 
comfort of any who might follow 
my epic leap, attach a heater to that 
goddamned Transporter grille. And 
three, don't ever wear that shirt 
again. We look horrible in it.” 

“I wish a grammarian were here 
to record these struggles with pro- 
nouns. Go on.” 

I pour tea from the thermos he 
brought me with the soup. Steam 
curls up from the mug — thank god, 
something hot at last. I wrap my 
fingers around the warmth. 

“What you really want me to do 
is confess. All right, why not? My 
own world is gone forever, so can it 
matter? I used the Transporter, 
more than half hoping it would kill 
me, because of love.” 

“Nonsense.” His face is harsh, 
as if he denies the emotion’s ex- 
istence.

“You might be right. Not love, 
then. Instead let us call it the lack 
of love, a failure to win the woman 
I craved. Her name was Helene. A 
remarkable woman. Whore, angel, 
goddess, little girl . she could be 
any of them she cared to be, when 
she cared at all. I loved her with a 
passion I never knew I was capable 
of, before — ” 

The other Joseph Argos starts to 
laugh bitterly. 

“Have I said something funny?” 
“Not merely funny — hilarious. 
You blind, romantic idiot!” 

My eyes are narrower in anger 
than his are in mirth. “That’s 
enough of your insults. Either ex- 
plain yourself or — ” 

“Clearly,” he says, breath still 
quivering with repressed laughter, 
“we share only appearance, and not 
temperament, or you would under- 
stand.” 

“Meaning?” 

“Let me quote you. ‘Not very 
far, it seems,’ you said, when I 
usked you the distance between 
your world and this one. But it was 
farther than you thought, much 
farther!” He can hadly speak for 
laughing, but then calm takes him, 
sudden as a serpent, and he cocks a 
finger at me in the gesture I once 
used to lecture particularly obtuse 
students. “Trust me, Joseph, when 
I tell you the bitch was not worth 
(he anguish.” 

My first angry impulse, even 
after all my suffering, is to strike 
him for insulting her. “And how do 
you happen to know the character 
of Helene Falk?” 

“Dear self, that is the simplest 
part of it. Look; there are two of us 
Itcre. Stretch your mind! You 



chased your Helene in vain for two 
years, whereas I, in this uni- 
verse ...” 

“Impossible!” 

“Not at all. I married the frigid 
bitch, and I regret it dearly.” 

* * * 

It is fully ten minutes before I 
can speak to him. He watches me 
warily as I prowl the cellar, my 
muscles straining against the awful 
futility of life. I want to hit some- 
thing. At one point I do snap, pull- 
ing down a crateful of short 
aluminum pipes, which clang and 
roll across the cellar floor in ran- 
dom dispersion. 

And all he does is watch me, 
waiting for the fit to pass. 

If there are gods who rule over 
man, then they are all sadists. In 
my world I loved a Helene who saw 
me as nothing more than another 
kill for her father. A longer stalking 
than most, perhaps, but unnotable 
beyond that. Yet in this world there 
is a Helene who gave freely in re- 
sponse to the blandishments of 
Joseph Argos, only to find herself 
soul-bound in a liar’s bed, tied to a 
hollow man. 

My anger is incredible, but point- 
less. At last it ebbs. More than ever 
I see how final a step I took in 
throwing away my world. The pat- 
terns here are different. I tell myself 
that I have no choice but to accept 
them. 

Of course that does no good. I 
can think only two things: I am 
lost, Helene is lost. 

I continue to pace, avoiding the 
pipes I have spilled. The silence is 



DUET 



37 




oppressive, horribly so, and at last I 
shudder and give in and start to talk 
to my other self. 

The topic of Helene is laid aside 
for a time; an unspoken truce has 
been called. Instead we talk of our 
respective worlds, noting the unpre- 
dictable differences in our lives, our 
projects, our ambitions. I am forced 
to acknowledge that he is a brilliant 
man, perhaps my intellectual 
superior. But there has been a more 
practical bent to my life. I was 
richer in my world than he is in his, 
more of my work applied instead of 
purely theoretical. 

At these moments in the compari- 
son he usually insults me for not 
being faithful to the purity of scien- 
tific thought, but I know better. He 
is jealous. 

Two hours pass before we run 
out of convenient subjects to hide 
behind, I do not notice the first 
mention of Helene, but suddenly 
she is among us more strongly than 
before. I listen, distraught, as he re- 
cites a catalog of her faults. Then I 
move to defend her, explaining 
these “faults” as products of his 
imagination. It is difficult to say 
these things without knowing his 
Helene, but I remain steadfast in 
my central position: he is lucky to 
be in a world where she loves him. 

I don’t care if we share a face. 
This man is not me. I am no cynical 
hypocrite, damning a woman for 
her frigidity one moment and then 
implying, in the next, that she cuck- 
olds me on a dozen fronts. If I 
ever were that man, or had the po- 
tential to be, he died forever in the 
whirling shadows. 

I do not merely dislike this 
carnival-mirror version of me. 



I hate him. 

“A week after the wedding,” he 
says pleasantly, enjoing my discom- 
fort, “I realized why I had actually 
gone to the extreme of legalizing 
the affair. She was the perfect bau- 
ble to dangle in people’s faces, a 
prize that proved short, ugly Argos 
could capture beauty as well as 
honor. There was a certain prestige 
in owning her. And before the mar- 
riage I had every reason to suspect 
that she would grace my bed as 
admirably as my awards decorate 
my office. ” 

“This is vile. You talk about her 
as if she were a piece of meat.” 

“Isn’t she?” 

“Why do you hate her so? Don t 
be blinded by beauty — the person 
within is more complex than she 
looks. In my world — ” 

“Precisely. In your world,” He 
leans back, straightening his coat 
where it has pulled up over his 
round stomach. “I would very 
much like to meet that Helene. She 
sounds like cold fire. I would enjoy 
that. But the Helene here is an im- 
mature creature, ruled by whim and 
blown hither and yon on the winds 
of deceit. She is both an annoyance 
and a grave disappointment.” 

“Then divorce her,” I urge. 
“Let her find someone more deserv- 
ing.” 

“That is a remarkably feeble in- 
sult.” 

“It’s the best I can manage under 
the circumstances.” 

“I will ignore it. As for divorce, 
I probably will, but I’ve no inten- 
tion of taking that easy road out 
until I’m through victimizing her. 
Don’t look so startled! This world 
has been as unfair to me as yours

was to you. The little whore kept 
up a false front throughout our 
courtship, fooled me into marrying 
her, and I am convinced now that 
her instincts were purely mercenary, 
that she did it all to feed off my 
fame and position in the communi- 
ty. Seeing as I’ve received little in 
return, I intend to leave scars before 
I release her to her sordid pool of 
friends. Let her lovers appreciate 
her then, if they can. " 

At this terrible statement 1 can 
only tum my head. 

I hear him rise, releasing a single 
heavy breath. His grey trousers rus- 
tle as he steps into my new line of 
sight. 1 look up; our eyes lock; and 
we both see there can be no sharing 
between us. 

"What exactly do you plan to 
do? I won't suggest another jaunt 
on the Transporter. You might not 
be so lucky a second time. But I am 
sure you can see that there are cer- 
tain difficulties in having two re- 
spected scientists with the same 
name, same face, perhaps even the 
same fingerprints, living in one 
community. This leaves us in a 
quandry. it’s a shame, really. When 
1 first saw you. I thought we might 
be able to work together; we could 
certainly accomplish mighty things 
with this trick of being in two 
places at once. But . no. 

“1 repeat myself; what are your 
plans?” 

His tone of voice is calm, almost 
friendly, but his eyes betray his real 
intentions. 

“Just how much do you hate 
your Helene?” 

He is not expecting another ques- 
tion on that matter. It takes him a 
moment to reply.

DUET 



“Well, now . , quite a lot. Yes. 
I would very much like to kill her, 
except that that would bring the tor- 
ture to a premature end.” 

I collapse to my knees with a 
broken sob, bowing my head 
against slumped shoulders. 

“Come on, you snivelling bas- 
tard, get up. We’ve got to decide 
what you are going to do.” 

“Joseph,” I say as I stand, “I 
am going to do the proper thing.” 

The look on his face when he 
sees the pipe in my hand is beyond 
price. 

* * * 

I must be the first man in history 
to commit suicide and still have to 
dispose of my own corpse. No mat- 
ter; easily done with the Transporter 
handy. I drop the bloody pipe on 
the grille and dump the body after 
it. Where he is, he won’t mind the 
cold. 

Shadows spin. 1 squint my eyes 
against the sudden flare of bright 
color. When I can see again, there is 
nothing on the grille. 

The next half hour I spend scrub- 
bing blood from the floor, and shift- 
ing crates to cover what stains are 
left. I can effect something more 
permanent later. Helene is not in 
the house when I go upstairs, which 
fans my impatience at the same 
time it makes me sigh with relief. 
This way is better, I know, and I 
can count myself fortunate. 

His bathtub is not as large as 
mine was. 

* * * 

She comes home at sunset and 



finds me waiting for her in the hall 
chair. 1 have used the last of the af- 
ternoon to study the house, skim 
my other self’s files, read newspap- 
ers and magazines. My fit into his 
role must be as smooth as possible. 

Her expression is startled. Under- 
standably so. If her false husband, 
that other Argos, were in my place, 
it would signal the beginning of 
some new cruelty. 

But no more. 

As gently as 1 can, I say “Wel- 
come home, my love.” 

She steps back into the door, dis- 
belief plainly written on her face. 
She holds a large brown shopping 
bag in front of her like a shield. 

I can only stare at her, lost in a 
joy so intense it is numbing. It is 
Helene — the same but not the same, 
familiar and yet new. Her eyes, 
wide at the sight of me, are the 
same beautiful gold as those that 
had condemned me only hours be- 
fore. Her figure is thinner from 
care, but still good, and though 
there are the shadows of premature 
wrinkles on her face, she is my 
Helene, the one I was bom for. I 
can feel it. 

The reverie ends. She is taking 
her cue from me, waiting to dis- 
cover what the trick is. But there 
will be no trick. I rise, reach for- 
ward, and carefully draw her right 
hand from its grip on the bag. I kiss 
it. 

“Don’t, Joseph.” 

“But I want to. When I love a 
woman, I want her to know it. 
Come now, where have you been, 
what have you done? I want to 
know. I feel like I’ve been waiting 
for you to come home for years. ” 

One of her eyebrows arches like 



40 



GALAXY 




a bird’s wing. "Are you well?” 

“Of course I’m well. I just 
missed you.” Inside, 1 chuckle. I 
can see her ticking possibilities over 
in her mind: he is planning some- 
thing; he lies; he is angry at me for 
being gone so long; he thinks I’ve 
been with a lover — God, how I 
wish! 

“If you say so,” she says, cast- 
ing a glance behind her as if to 
check possible routes of escape. 
Then she steps quickly past me . I 
shut the door. The tension in her 
shoulders is pitiable. Having turned 
her back on me, having made* her- 
self vulnerable, she expects a blow 
to fall. 

The longer I am in this world, the 
more horrified I grow at “my” ac- 
tion in it. 

“I'm sorry I’m late. I was at the 
market picking up things for dinner 
tonight, but when I wanted to leave, 
the car wouldn’t start. The battery 
was dead. I had to buy a new one. I 
didn’t want to spend the money, but 
the man with the tow truck said the 
old one was past help, that it 
wouldn’t hold a recharge, so . 

I smile. “That’s fine, Helene. 
You did the right thing.” 

“I did?” 

“Yes.” 

“Are you sure you’re well?” 

“Never better. Here, let me take 
the bag.” Freed from that grip, her 
hands seek each other. They 
squeeze themselves white. 

“We’ve got to talk about last 
night, Joseph. I know I don’t say 
things clearly enough to please you, 
but this is important. So many 
strange things have been 
happening — ” 

I cut her off. Obviously they had 



some argument, but it is not rele- 
vant to the new order of things. 

“It doesn’t matter, darling. Just 
relax. Perhaps after dinner we 
can . yes, that's just the thing. 
After dinner we will take a hot 
bath. I will scrub your back and lis- 
ten to whatever you wish to say. ” 

“Bath? But you never ... I 
mean . Joseph, this is very im- 
portant ...” 

“We can be just as serious in the 
tub, and much more comfortable 
than we are standing here like mar- 
ble statues.” 

“Well ... all right. I suppose it 
was meant to wait.” 

“Helene ...” Her sadness stirs 
me. I put down the bag and take 
her into my arms. I kiss her. At 
first she resists, but that passes, be- 
coming simple indifference. No 
matter. I am happy. There will be 
time to teach her what love can be 
like. 

We walk together into the 
kitchen. There we kiss again, and 
this time she does not shy. In fact, 
the kiss is so intense that I am 
caught by surprise. My own Helene 
had never opened to me like that. 

“Lord! If dinner is half the qual- 
ity of that kiss, darling, it will be 
the greatest meal of my life. What 
are you cooking for us?” 

She looks at me oddly. 

“Lamb, of course. It’s what you 
told me to get. Don’t you re- 
member?” 

A faux pas. Damn. I try to make 
complimentary excuses, saying that 
the sight of her drove all memory 
from me, but I do it far too clum- 
sily. When I leave her to begin the 
meal, her face is still troubled. 
Clearly I must be careful about ask- 



OUET 



41 




ing questions. Even the most inno- 
cent one might betray me. 

But we will both adjust, given 
time. 

I go to the library. In the corner 
where I had kept my favorite chair 
there is only a naugahyde 
monstrosity. My other self had been 
a cheap man, as lax about maintain- 
ing his house as his marriage. 

While I occupy myself with more 
journals, I hear creaking noises from 
the hall and stairs. One more sign 
of how poorly built this house is. I 
know — 1 will build another one. I 
will build a proper mansion for my 
new wife, something to celebrate a 
miraculous beginning. 

What a bizarre, remarkable day. I 
regret none of it. 

* * * 

The lamb is delicious, its spicing 
a culinary marvel. The old Helene 
could not cook to save her soul. 
The new one continues to shine in 
comparison. 

She does not speak much during 
the meal. What talk we have is 
pleasantly inconsequential. I watch 
her throughout, something which 
gives me even more pleasure than 
the food does. She has changed into 
a formal but simple tan dress. 
Against it her hair and skin seem to 
glow. She wears little makeup, and 
has even less need of it. 

There is a veil over her emotions, 
but it does not worry me. One day I 
will look and it will be gone. 

Part of the veil seems to 
be . resignation? 

No, 1 am imagining it. My hap- 
piness doubles and redoubles. An 
exquisite meal. 

42 



After dinner is disposed of, when 
we sit alone with each other and the 
wine, I start to praise her cooking. 

She interrupts me. There is more 
strength in her manner than there 
was this afternoon, which pleases 
me. But her words . 

“Joseph, I have something very 
important to say' and not much time 
to say it. ” 

“There is the bath, my dear,” I 
point out. 

“Why are you pretending to be 
kind? Drop this act, Joseph — it 
doesn’t begin to make up for 
things.” 

“Ah, but they will be different 
now! I promise you an idyll. No, 
nothing that foolish. Forget I said 
that. What 1 promise you is a real 
marriage, with love at its core. I’ll 
prove it. We can go travelling if 
you want. I’ll — ” I intend more, 
but a belch stops me in mid- 
sentence. 1 have eaten far too much. 
My feeling of pleasant fullness is 
turning into stuffy discomfort. 

“Two years, Joseph. You turned 
so hateful when we married. I never 
understood that. I thought it was my 
fault. I was so gullible, so ready to 
believe you. You made me guilty, 
just like you’ve done your best ever 
since to make me crazy. I haven’t 
had a loving marriage — unless you 
call all those beatings love!” 

“Now, Helene — ” 

“Don’t even try to be concilia- 
tory. That’s a trick of yours I 
stopped believing a long time ago. I 
wish that was all it would have 
taken to leave! But I couldn’t. You 
were always right about that, I 
didn’t have the strength to leave 
you.” 

“Wait, please — give me a 
GALAXY 




chance!” Why are my ears ringing? 
When I speak, my voice seems to 
echo. “I am a new man. How new 
a man you cannot guess!” 

“Is that the tenth or eleventh 
time you’ve said that?” 

“This time it is true, 1 swear it. 
Just — ummph. Pardon me, I have 
eaten too much — just give me an 
opportunity to prove it.” 

“No.” 

“Helene — ” 

‘Wo. You can’t sway me any 
more. I almost broke down when I 
came home and saw you waiting, 
but somewhere I found my strength, 
and you can’t sway me any more. 
Don’t even try. Just listen to me, 
this last time. I went into your cel- 
lar last night, after you beat me, 
while you were sleeping. I wanted 
to smash things! I wanted you to 
wake up to the sound of one of 
your precious projects being mined. 
I thought if I could make you angry 
enough, you’d kill me, and I’d Fi- 
nally be" free. But I didn’t get a 
chance to touch anything. 

“The most amazing thing hap- 
pened. Two years of prayers were 
answered last night, and the hysteri- 
cal part of it is that 1 have you to 
thank for it!” 

This becomes more and more 
confusing. To worsen things, my 
indigestion has become nausea, the 
ringing a fierce headache. I feel 
sweat on my forehead. “W-what 
are you talking about, blast it?” 
“You. Darling.” 

I swear a silent oath; I will never 
eat spiced lamb again. The room 
seems to balance on the edge of col- 
lapse, as flimsy as a card castle I 
barely hear her. “What?” I draw in 
a heavy, ragged breath. “Helene, 



please help me to the couch. 1 am 
not feeling well. ” 

The world flickers. 

Just once, but it changes every- 
thing. I see what must surely be 
hallucinations. 

I see Helene’s face; unconcerned, 
implacable. 1 sec an indistinct figure 
behind her, standing i n the shadows 
of the curtain. I am sure it was not 
there during the meal ... my body 
begins to tremble with a frightening 
violence. I am alternately frozen 
and on fire. 

“Please, Helene, help me . .” 

“Like you helped me?” 

I fall from the chair, spilling 
blood-red wine on the tablecloth 
and floor. 

“I won’t argue with miracles, 
scientific or otherwise. I needed one 
too much. Last night he came to me 
in the cellar, out of nowhere, need- 
ing me like you never have.” 

A moment passes in which 1 can 
see nothing at all but a chill black- 
ness. Then vision returns. Helene is 
standing above me, her downward 
gaze still untroubled. I reach up, 
weakly, for her hand. 

To her side is the obscure figure, 
now distinct, holding Helene’s taller 
body within a comforting arm. 

I scream. 

“Au revoir, Joseph.” 

The last thing I see, before the 
dark circle closes in from all sides 
to smother the pain, is my own ten- 
der smile.

“That was so hard to do. If you 
had come here even a month ago, I 
don’t know if I could have hated 
him enough ...”

“Hush, love, it’s silly to talk 
about. 1 came here when I came 
here. And it isn’t as if Joseph Argos 
is really dead. Just a warped version 
of him, a perversion of a good man. 
That is to say, me.” He pulled her 
head down and kissed her. He had 
kissed her a lot since the night be- 
fore. It was still so new to him, his 
good fortune. “I’m proud of you.” 

They clung to each other, hungry 
to think only of each other and not 
their pasts. His hand moved down 
her back suggestively, but she 
stopped him. 

“We have to do something about 
the body. ” 

Carrying the corpse downstairs 
was much more gruesome than 
watching its death had been, even 
after wrapping it, mummy like, in 
the stained tablecloth. It was a 
clumsy burden. They dropped it on 
the stairs and it crashed to the bot- 
tom, shaking the whole house, and 
though they tried to laugh off their 
nervousness, they couldn’t. 

Neither relaxed until after the 
Transporter had done its work. 
They did wonder why there was 
pipe all over the floor, but not for 
long. There were much more impor- 
tant things to think of. 

Back upstairs they did something 
about that. He was very careful of 
her bruises. 

* * * 

In the middle of the night, as 
they lay locked together in sleep, 
there was more motion in the cellar. 

The deep shadows trembled, and 
then spun. Rainbow flashes chased 
round the room, and when they de- 
parted, there was a still body on the 



Transporter grille. Not dead; only 
unconscious. The cellar chill soon 
revived her. 

She stared at her surroundings in 
hatred, too deep in her own murky 
thoughts to notice that there was no 
linoleum on the floor, or that the 
light fixtures were fluorescent. Beat 
her over the head, would he, and 
leave her in a freezing cellar while 
he screwed around upstairs? She 
had turned her head too many 
times; she was a Christian woman; 
she would abide his faithlessness no 
longer. Hadn’t she done everything 
he ever asked of her, and never 
asked for anything in return? Hadn’t 
she worked to make him great, and 
then later to salvage as much of 
their reputations as she could, not 
that there was much to save, the 
way he catted from one bed to 
another. That . lying . , adul- 
terer! And he dared to complain 
when she tried to do the right thing? 
He dared to hit her back? 
He . he . 

The thought dissolved in inarticu- 
late fury. 

Pipes all over the floor. Typical 
of him. 

Helene picked up one length in 
each hand, thinking: I’ll kill him, 
I’ll kill him, I’ll kill him . 

* * * 

And in an infinity of universes, 
in an infinitude of cellars and attics 
and barns and warehouses and bed- 
rooms and forests and office build- 
ings and, in fact, everywhere an 
analog of Argos had built an analog 
of the Transporter, things were 
balancing out. Shadows, col- 
ors . gone. ★

At the Tenth General Assembly of 
the World Conference on Exobiol- 
ogy in Sofia , Bulgaria, DANNY 
DALEHOUSE hears for the first time 
of the semi-stellar object N-OA 
Bes-bes Geminorum 8426 — 
sometimes called Kung’s Star — and 
its planet, Son of Kung, or 
Klong ... or JEM. Jem is inhabit- 
ed! Not with just one intelligent 
species, but with three: a race of 
sentient hydrogen-filled balloons, 
weasel-like burrowers and hard- 
shelled arthropods. They are the 
first sentient life discovered any- 
where in the universe off Earth. 

The race to explore Jem is on. 
All three of the great power blocs of 
terrestrial nations prepare expedi- 
tions: the Food countries, like the 
U.S.A. and the Soviet Union; the 
oil-rich Fuel bloc of Venezuela, Eng- 
land and the Arab states; the 
People’s Republics, headed by 
China. 

In Sofa, Dale house has met and 
had a brief affair with CAPTAIN 
MARJORIE MENNINGER, a young 
American Army officer with 
shadowy family connections into the 
mysterious high levels of govern- 
ment and intelligence. The two of 
them get into a scrape with the 
police and are rescued by ANA 
DIMITROVA, a translator for the 
Conference. Ana is Bulgarian, and 
therefore also a member of the 
Food Bloc, but she is in love with 
AHMED DULLA, the Pakistani who 
presented the report on Jem, who is 
a Peep. Marge Menninger promises 
to see that a Food Bloc expedition 
will go to Jem, and that Dale house 
will be on it. She keeps her prom- 
ise, but the Peeps are quicker. Dul- 
la’s expedition is the first to land. 



Arriving first is not all advan- 
tageous, however; Jem is full of 
perils. The chemistry of its biota is 
hostile to terrestrial life, and most 
of the Peeps become quick casual- 
ties with severe allergic reactions. 
Some die. Dulla attempts to estab- 
lish contact with the Krinpit, the 
armored, crab-like creatures. The 
allergic process works both ways. 
Dulla becomes ill and helpless in 
the Krinpit village, and so do many 
of the Krinpit. Some of them die, 
including the mate of the Krinpit 
named Sharn-igon. 

When Dalehouse’ s expedition ar- 
rives on Jem, its leaders have 
learned some lessons from the dis- 
asters that befell the Peeps. But the 
planet still has surprises. Dalehouse 
and his friend, the Russian pilot 
KAPPELYUSHNIKOV, attempt to 
establish contact with the airborne 
race of balloonists . They have some 
success, and decide to build bal- 
loons of their own to join them in 
the sky. They even observe the bal- 
loonists spawning over their camp. 
Scientifically, this is a triumph. But 
as they breed, the balloonists se- 
crete a spray which is both hal- 
lucinogenic and aphrodisiac. It is 
the finest high on two worlds — and 
the whole Food camp trips out.

Ana Dimitrova sat at a window 
table of a Greek tea shop in Glas- 
gow, writing industriously on her 
daily letter to Ahmed. She did not 
send them all. That would be ruin- 
ously extravagant! But every week, 
at the end of Sunday, she spread 
them out on a table and copied out 
the best parts, enough to fill four 



46 



GALAXY 




dots in a microfiche. It was never 
enough. She leaned forward into the 
northern sunshine, left elbow on the 
table next to the cooling cup of 
strong, sweet tea, head resting on 
the hand, oblivious to the noise of 
the lorries and the double-decker 
yellow-and-green buses on the Gal- 
lowgate road outside, and wrote: 

— it seems so long since last I 
kissed your lovely eyelids and 
wished you good-by. I miss you, 
dear Ahmed. This place is terri- 
ble! Terrible and strange. It 
smells of petroleum and 
internal-combustion engines, the 
smell of wicked waste. Well. 
They have only another five or 
ten years and then their North 
Sea oil will be gone, and then 
we will see. 

The headaches have been very 
bad, I think because these lan- 
guages are so uncouth. It is ac- 
tual pain to speak in them. It 
will be all right, though, dear 
Ahmed. The headaches pass. 
The ache in my heart lasts much 
longer— 

“More tea, miss?” 

The harsh English words crashed 
into Nan’s ear. She winced and 
raised her head. “Thank you, no.” 
“We’ll be serving lunch in just a 
bit, miss. The souvlaki’s very tasty 
today, cook says.” 

“No, no. Thank you. I must be 
getting back to my hotel.” She had 
dawdled longer over the letter than 
was right, she thought remorsefully, 
and now she had to hurry, and the 
headache was back. It was not just 
that the woman was speaking Eng- 
lish. It was the way she spoke it, 



the rough Scottish consonants that 
buzzed and rattled in the ear. Al- 
though in truth it did not much mat- 
ter what language, or at least what 
non-Slavic language, she was hear- 
ing. The headaches were more fre- 
quent and more severe. It was prob- 
ably because she had become a dip- 
lomatic translator. The international 
vocabulary of science was easy 
enough to translate, since so many 
of the words had the same roots in 
all languages. In diplomacy the 
risks were greater, the nuances sub- 
tler and more threatening. The 
choice of an adjective meant noth- 
ing in translating a report on X-ray 
polarimetry, but in a speech about 
locating a drilling claim on the 
mid-Atlantic ridge it might mean 
the difference between peace and 
war. 

Nan paid her check and dodged 
cautiously across Gallowgate, be- 
tween the towering buses that so 
mischievously raced along the 
wrong side of the street. The diesel 
stink made her cough, and coughing 
made her headache worse. 

And she was late. She was to be 
picked up for the airport at one,. and 
it was past noon already. She 
walked virtuously past the shops (so 
bright and gay!) without looking in 
a single window. There were styles 
here that Sofia would not see for 
another year. But why bother? It 
would have been nice to buy new 
clothes to wear for Ahmed. With 
him so many billions of kilometers 
away, Nan usually wore what was 
easiest to put on, and least likely to 
attract attention. Evenings she spent 
alone when she could, listening to 
music and studying grammar. Her 
best treat was to reread the sparse 



JEM 



47 




letters he had returned for her pro- 
digious outflow. Although they 
were not stimulating. From what he 
said. Son of Kung sounded a grim 
and awful place. 

She cut through a comer of the 
Green to walk along the riverside 
toward her hotel, hoping to avoid 
the noise and the invisible, but not 
unsmellable, exhaust from all the 
vehicles. No use. Lorries rumbled 
along the embankment, and the 
sludgy surface of the Clyde itself 
was pocked with oil tankers and 
barges and creased with the wake of 
hydrofoils. How did one live in a 
place like this? And it all could 
have been avoided. A little 
forethought. A little planning. Why 
did they have to put oil refineries in 
the middle of a city? Why stain 
their river with waste and filth, 
when it could have been a cool 
oasis? Why be in such a rush to 
pump the oil from the bottom of the 
sea, when it could have provided 
energy, even food, for another 
hundred generations? Why use oil at 
all, for that matter — especially in 
these packs and swarms of cars and 
lorries — when the city could have 
been built around public transporta- 
tion, electrically powered, or pow- 
ered with the hydrogen that Iceland, 
not so very far away, was so eager 
to sell. 

But on Son of Kung. 

On Son of Kung it could be all 
different. She wished she could be 
there. With Ahmed. Not just to be 
with Ahmed, she told herself stout- 
ly, but to be part of a new world 
where things could be done prop- 
erly. Where the mistakes of Earth 
could be avoided. Where one’s 



children would have a future to look 
forward to. 

Hers and Ahmed’s children, of 
course. Nan smiled to herself. She 
was an honest person, and she ad- 
mitted to herself that Kungson 
seemed all the finer because Ahmed 
was there. If only she were not 
here ! There were worrisome things 
between the lines of what he 
wrote. So many of his expedition 
had been sick. So many had died, 
just in the first days — and his only 
letters had been in those first days. 
Why, he himself could have — No. 
She would not countenance that 
thought. There was enough to worry 
about in other things. In, for exam- 
ple, the picture he had sent of him- 
self. He had looked worryingly 
thin, but what she had noticed most 
about the picture was the hand on 
his shoulder. The person who 
owned the hand was not visible, but 
Nan was almost sure it was a wom- 
an’s hand. And that was even more 
worrying. 

“Miss Dimitrova! Hoy, there. 
Nan! ” 

All at once she perceived that her 
feet had carried her into the lobby 
of the hotel, and she was being 
greeted by a man she almost recog- 
nized. Dark, short, plump, a little 
past middle age; he had a dip- 
lomat’s smile and wore clothes that, 
even across the immense old lobby, 
she was sure were real wool. If not 
cashmere. 

He filled in the blank for her. 
“I’m Tam Gulsmit. Remember? We 
met at the F.A.O. reception last 
month.” He snapped his fingers for 
a forkboy. “Your bags are all 
ready — unless you care to freshen 
up? Have time for a drink?”

Now she recalled him well. He 
had been persistent in his attentions, 
even to the point of lying in wait 
lor her as she came out of the pow- 
der room and drawing her into an 
offensively close conversation in the 
hall. She had explained to him that 
it was no use. It was not merely a 
question of being in love with 
someone else. That was not his 
concern, she did not have to tell 
him her reasons. It was a matter of 
socialist morality. V. I. Lenin had 
said it. Free love was all very well, 
but who would want to drink from a 
glass that every passerby had fouled 
with his lips? (And yet in Moscow, 
she remembered, the public drink- 
ing fountains had just such glasses 
chained to them, and each one 
surely smeared with a thousand 
lips.) Let the Fuel powers do what 
they liked, partner-swapping, group 
orgies, whatever. She was not there 
to pass judgment, but a socialist girl 
I'mm Sofia did not even smoke in 
i he street, because she had been 
taught certain principles of behavior 
that did not leave her when she 
grew up. 

“Sir Tam,” she began — she re- 
membered that he had one of those 
quaint British handles to his 
name — “it is a pleasure to see you 
again, but I must fly now to New 
York for the United Nations debate. 

I have no time — ” 

“All the time in the world, 
tweets, that’s what I’m here for 
llov!” 

tardily, the bellboy rolled up with 
lus forklift, and that was scandal- 
ous, too: her one little zipper bag 
ilid not need a fuel-guzzling 
machine to carry it, she had toted it 
a kilometer at a time herself. Sir 

IfM 



Tam chuckled indulgently. “Aren’t 
we quaint? This great, rambling old 
ruin — that’s the Britishness of it, 
isn’t it? We’re great at backing a 
losing horse long past the point 
where anyone else would have 
chucked it in. Lucky for us we can 
afford it! Now, is there anything 
else you need to bring?” 

“But truly, Sir Tam, a car is 
being sent to take me to the airport. 
It will be here any minute.” 

“Here already, sweetie. I’m it. 
Our Government has provided me 
with a Concorde Three and I’d just 
rattle around in it by myself. When 
I heard that a friend of God Men- 
ninger’s needed a lift, I took the lib- 
erty of coming for you myself. 
You’ll like it. There’s plenty of 
room, and we’ll make New York in 
ninety minutes.” 

Scandalous, scandalous! Of 
course the British could afford any- 
thing, ocean of oil under the North 
Sea, their octopus tendrils already 
grabbing at the MidAtlantic Ridge. 
But morally it was so wrong. 

She had no chance to object. Sir 
Tam overcame all objections, and 
before she knew what was happen- 
ing, she was lifted gently by cher- 
rypicker into — dear God! — a super- 
sonic hydrojet. 

As soon as they belted up, in 
deep, foamed armchairs with a 
suction-bottomed decanter and 
glasses already on a little table be- 
tween them, the aircraft hurled itself 
into the air. The acceleration was 
frightening. The way the ground 
dropped away beneath them was not 
to be believed. Strangely, there was 
less noise than she had expected, 
far less than the warmup roar of a 
clamjet “How quiet,” she said, 

49 




leaning away from Sir Tam’s casu- 
ally chummy arm. 

He chuckled. “That’s five 
thousand kilometers an hour for 
you. We leave the sound far be- 
hind. Do you like it?’’ 

“Oh, yes,” said Nan, trying to 
prevent him from pouring her a 
drink. She failed. 

“Your voice sounds more like 
‘oh, no.’ ” 

“Well, yes, perhaps that is so. 
It is terribly wasteful of oil, Sir 
Tam.” 

“We don’t bum oil, sweetie! 
Pure hydrogen and oxygen — have to 
carry them both, this far up. Not an 
ounce of pollution.” 

“But of course one bums oil, or 
some other fuel, to make the hydro- 
gen.” She wondered if she could 
keep the conversation on propellant 
chemistry all the way across the At- 
lantic, decided not and took a new 
tack: “It is frightening. One can see 
nothing from these tiny windows.” 
“What is there to see? You get 
turned on by clouds, love?” 

“I have flown the oceans many 
times. Sir Tam. There is always 
something. Sometimes icebergs. 
The sea itself. In a clamjet there is 
the excitement of the landfall as one 
approaches Newfoundland or Rio or 
the Irish Coast. But at twenty-five 
thousand meters there is nothing.” 
“I couldn’t agree with you 
more,” said Sir Tam, unstrapping 
and moving closer. “If I had my 
way, there ’d be no windows in the 
thing at all.” 

Nan moistened her lips with the 
whiskey and said brightly, “But it 
is all so exciting. Could you 
perhaps show me around this air- 
craft?” 



“Show you around?” 

“Yes, please. It is so new to 
me.” 

“What’s to see, love?” Then he 
shrugged. “Matter of fact, yes, 
there are a few features I’d like to 
call to your attention.” 

She stood up gratefully, glad to 
get his hand off her knee. The 
headaches had lessened, perhaps 
because now they were breathing 
quite pure air instead of the 
Glaswegian smog, but she was an- 
noyed. He had made it clear that 
they were the only passengers, that 
was not deceitful. But she had ex- 
pected at least the chaperonage of 
the stewardesses and they, all three 
of them, had retreated to their little 
cubbyholes in the aft of the aircraft. 
The little paneled lounge was far 
more intimate than she liked. 

But worse was in store. What she 
had thought was a service cubicle 
turned out to be a tiny, complete 
bedroom suite. With, could one be- 
lieve it?, a wutcrbed. Easily a met- 
ric tonne of profligately wasted 
mass! For nothing surely but profli- 
gately immoral purposes! 

“Now there,” said Sir Tam over 
her shoulder, “is a feature worth 
studying. Go ahead. Nan. Let your 
impulses carry you. Try it out.” 
“Certainly not!” She moved 
away from his touching hand and 
added formally, “Sir Tam, I must 
tell you that I am an engaged per- 
son. It is not correct for me to 
allow myself to be in a situation of 
this kind. ” 

“How quaint.” 

“Sir Tam!” She was almost 
shrieking now, and furiously angry, 
not only with him but with herself. 
If she had used a tiny bit of in- 



50 



GALAXY 




lelligence, she would have known 
Ihis was coming and could have 
avoided it. A delicate hint that this 
was the wrong time. A suggestion 
of, what? Of a social disease, if 
necessary. Anything. But she was 
trapped, the waterbed before her, 
this gland case behind, already with 
his lips against her ear and whisper- 
ing buzzingly so that her headache 
exploded again. Desperately she 
caught at a straw. "Didn’t— -didn’t 
you mention Godfrey Menninger?” 

“What?” 

“Godfrey Menninger. The father 
of my good friend. Captain Marge 
Menninger. You spoke of him in 
the hotel.” 

He was silent for a moment, 
neither releasing her or trying to 
pull her close. “Do you know God 
Menninger well?” 

“Only through his daughter. 1 
was able to keep her from going to 
jail once. ” 

His arm was definitely less tight. 
After a moment he patted her gently 
and stepped away. “Let’s have a 
drink,” he said, ringing for the 
stewardesses. The satyr’s smile had 
been replaced by the diplomat’s. 

The conversation was back on its 
tracks again, for which Ana was in- 
tensely grateful. She even managed 
to return to the little cubicle with 
the armchairs, and to persuade the 
stewardess to bring her a nice cup of 
strong chai instead of the whiskey 
Gulsmit suggested. He seemed 
greatly interested in the story of 
Margie Menninger ’s little episode. 
In every detail: had they been fin- 
gerprinted? Was the People’s 
Magistrate a court of record, what- 
ever that was? Had Ana spoken to 
unyone in the militia about the inci- 



dent later on, and if so, what had 
they said? 

Such trivial things seemed to 
interest him, but Nan was contented 
to go on dredging memories up for 
him all the way across the Atlantic, 
as long as it meant his keeping his 
hands to himself. When she was 
wrung dry, he leaned back, nursing 
the new drink the stewardess had 
poured for him and squinting out at 
the blue-black and cloudless sky. 

“Very interesting,” he said at 
last. “That poor little girl. Of 
course I’ve known her since she 
was tiny.” It had not occurred to 
Ana that Margie Menninger had 
ever been tiny. She let it pass and 
Sir Tam added, “And dear old 
God. Have you known him long?” 

“Not in a personal sense,” she 
said, careful not to add lying to the 
fault of being untruthful. “Of 
course he is of great importance in 
cultural matters. I too am deeply 
concerned about culture.” 

“Culture,” repeated Sir Tam 
meditatively. He seemed about to 
produce a real smile, but managed 
to retain the diplomatic one instead. 
“You are a dear, Nan,” he said, 
and shook his wristwatch to make 
the red numerals blink on. “Ah, 
almost there,” he said regretfully. 
“But of course you must allow me 
to escort you to your hotel.” 

* * * 

The morning session of the U.N. 
was exhausting. There was no time 
for a real lunch because she had to 
post-edit the computer translations 
of what she had already translated 
once that moming before they could 
be printed. And the afternoon ses- 
sion was one long catfight. 



JEM

The debate was on fishing rights 
for Antarctic krill. Because it was 
food, tempers ran high. And be- 
cause sea lore is almost as old a 
human area of interest as eating, the 
translation was demanding. There 
were no places where she could 
coast, no technical words that were 
new-coined and common to almost 
all languages. Every language had 
developed its own words for ships, 
seamanship and, above all, eating, at 
the dawn of language itself. Only 
three of Nan’s languages were in 
use, Bulgarian, English and Rus- 
sian. The Pakistanis were not in- 
volved in the debate, and there were 
plenty of others proficient in the 
Romance languages. So there were 
long periods when she could listen 
without having to speak. But there 
was no rest even in those periods; 
she needed to remember every 
word she could. The U.N. delegates 
had the awful habit of quoting each 
other at length — sometimes with 
approval, sometimes with a sneer, 
always with the risk of some tiny 
hairsplit that she had to get just 
right. Her headaches were immense. 

That was, of course, the price 
you paid for having the two hemis- 
pheres of your brain surgically 
sliced apart. Not to mention the 
stitching back of parts of them that 
kept you from stumbling into things 
or falling down, or the DNA injec- 
tions that left your neck swollen and 
your eyes bulging for weeks at a 
time, and sometimes caused sei- 
zures indistinguishable from 
epilepsy. That had been a surprise. 
They hadn’t told her about those 
things when she signed up to be- 
come a split-brain translator. Not 
really; you never did know what 



pain was going to be until you had 
it. 

What made the whole day an 
order of magnitude worse was that 
she was starved for sleep. 

Sir Tam had followed her to her 
very door, and then planted a fool 
inside it. His hands had been all 
over her in the limousine, all the 
way in from the airport. The only 
way she could think to get rid of 
him was by pretending such exhaus- 
tion that she could not stay awake 
another second, even though it was 
just after lunch. New York time. 
And then she found she had talked 
herself into it. 

So she did go to sleep. And woke 
up before midnight with the chance 
for any more sleep gone. And whal 
was there to do with the eleven 
hours before the morning session 
would begin? 

A letter to Ahmed, of course. A 
few hours with English irregular 
verbs. Another hour or so listening 
to the tapes she had just made, to 
check her accent. But then she was 
tired and fretful. What she needed 
most was a walk from her apart- 
ment past the university into the 
fresh morning air of the park, but 
that was ten thousand kilometers 
away in Sofia. In New York you 
did not go walking in the fresh 
morning air. And so she had turned 
up for duty in the translators’ booth 
feeling as though a hard day’s work 
was already behind her, and her 
head throbbing and pounding in two 
different rhythms, one in each tem- 
ple — Her mind had wandered. 

She forced it back. It was Sir 
Tam asking for the floor now, and 
she had to put his words into Bui 
garian.

GALAXY 




His face was purple-red and he 
was shouting. With one half of her 
brain Nan wondered at that, while 
the other half was automatically 
processing his words. So much pas- 
sion about such little fish! Not even 
fish. They were some sort of crus- 
tacean, weren’t they? To Nan, 
“krill” was something that old- 
fashioned peasant grannies stirred 
into their stews to give them body. 
It came as a grayish- white, powdery 
substance that you bought in jars 
labeled “fish protein concentrate.” 
You knew that it was good for you, 
but you didn’t like to think about 
what organs and oddities were 
ground up to make it. In food-rich 
Bulgaria, nobody grew excited 
about the stuff. 

But Sir Tam was excited. The 
Fuel Bloc needed it desperately, he 
shouted. Had to have it! Was enti- 
tled to it, by all the laws of 
civilized humanity! The Fuel Bloc 
already possessed the fleets of 
long-range factory ships that could 
seine the cold Antarctic Ocean. He 
quoted Pacem in Maris and the 
British-Portuguese Treaty of A.D. 
1242. The tiny bodies of the crea- 
tures that made up the krill, he de- 
claimed, were absolutely essential 
to British agriculture, being the very 
best kind of fertilizer for their 
crops. 

At which the Uruguayan delegate 
interrupted, snarling, “Agriculture! 
You are using the essential protein 
to feed to animals. ” 

“Of course,” Sir Tam replied 
stoutly. “We are not blessed with 
the advantages given your country, 
Senor Corrubias. We do not have 
immense plains on which our cattle 
can graze. In order to feed them 

JEM 



properly, we must have imports — ” 

Someone in the American delega- 
tion laughed out loud, not a pleas- 
ant laugh, and the Uruguayan 
drummed on his desk derisively. 
“So it is cattle you feed. Sir 
Gulsmit? But we have it on the evi- 
dence of your own Ministry of 
Health that you give the krill to 
your cats and budgies! Do you then 
make minced kitten patties, 
perhaps? Or fresh chops of par- 
rakeet?” 

Sir Tam looked long-sufferingly 
at the President Pro Tern. “Sir, I 
must ask the courtesy of the floor.” 

The President was a spare 
Ghanaian who had not once glanced 
toward any speaker. He did not do 
so now. His eyes stayed on the let- 
ters he was signing, one by one, as 
his secretary put them before him. 
He said, “I would request of the 
delegate from Uruguay that he re- 
serve his remarks until the delegate 
from the United Kingdom has con- 
cluded.” 

Sir Tam beamed graciously. 
“Thank you. In any case, I am al- 
most finished. Of course, some part 
of our imports of krill do find their 
way into pet food, some part into 
protein additives for the justly fam- 
ous British beef, some part into fer- 
tilizer to help us grow the vital 
foods that nature has otherwise de- 
nied us. Is that a matter for this 
body? I think not. What is of con- 
cern is the behavior of member 
states in their conduct in world af- 
fairs. We infringe no international 
treaty by continuing in the long 
British tradition of the sea, in har- 
vesting what is freely available to 
all in international waters, and of 
course in making suitable use of 

53 




those pelagic areas which, by exist- 
ing treaties freely arrived at by the 
member states, have long been re- 
served to us. But even this is not 
relevant to the motion before us to- 
day! That motion, I remind you, re- 
lates only to the proposal for a 
United Nations peacekeeping team 
to supervise the Antarctic fisheries. 
‘Peacekeeping,’ my dear fellow del- 
egates. A team to keep the peace. 
And therefore our position is clear. 
No such team is needed. The peace 
has been kept. There have been no 
incidents. There certainly will be 
none of our making. The United 
Nations has better things to do than 
to seek solutions for problems that 
do not exist. ” 

And he sat down, managing to do 
so with a bow to the President Pro 
Tern, a sardonic grin for the 
Uruguayan and, yes, even a wink 
for Ana, up in the translator’s 
booth! She shook her head in dis- 
tress at this frivolous-minded per- 
son. But perhaps he was serious 
after all, for he was already writing 
something on a scrap of paper and 
beckoning a page, even as the 
Ghanaian finished signing his let- 
ters, slapped his portfolio shut, 
glanced at the clock, and managed 
not to catch the Uruguayan dele- 
gate’s eye as he said, “I am in- 
formed that the address of the next 
delegate may occupy a substantial 
period of time. Since it is now four, 
I suggest we recess this debate until 
ten o’clock tomorrow morning.” 

A buzz rose up from the floor. 
Nan leaned back for a long mo- 
ment, massaging her temples, be- 
fore she stood up and allowed her- 
self to contemplate the next half 
hour: A quick meal, a bath, and 



then a lovely long sleep — 

No. It was not to be. As she 
opened the door to the booth, the 
page dashed up, out of breath, and 
handed her the note from Sir Tam. 
It said: 

Absolutely essential you attend 
the party in the DVL, and that I 
have the pleasure of escorting 
you. 

So there was no rest, no rest. She 
might have refused the invitation. 
But Sir Tam had taken the precau- 
tion of telling the head of the Bul- 
garian mission to the United Na- 
tions about it, and she was no 
sooner in her room than he was on 
the phone insisting she go. 

She bathed quickly and dressed in 
what she guessed might be appro- 
priate, then trotted back across the 
street from her hotel to the great 
quaint oblong building, so unlike its 
newer and fortress-like neighbors. 
Her head was pounding all the way. 
Diffidently she whispered her name 
to the guard at the Distinguished 
Visitors Lounge. He consulted a 
list, smiled frostily, and let her in. 

What a tumult! How much 
smoke, and what odors of food and 
drinks! And there was. Sir Tam, to 
be sure, tiny bouquet of flowers in 
one hand, the other hand on the 
shoulder of a plump, dark, grinning 
man whom Nan did not at once rec- 
ognize but who was the very 
Uruguayan with whom Sir Tam had 
been exchanging insults an hour be- 
fore. 

‘‘Nan! Ho, Nan! Over here!” He 
was beckoning her to him. She 
could not think of a reason for re- 
fusing, and knew before it happened 
that Gulsmit would be touching her 



54 



GALAXY 




again. And it happened just that 
way. The flowers turned out to be a 
bouquet of parma violets, outrage- 
ously out of season and, of course, 
lor her. Gulsmit insisted on pinning 
the corsage on her demure bodice 
himself, taking much more time 
over it than was necessary, while 
(he others in his little conversational 
group jovially pretended not to 
notice. 

It angered Nan that the Scot 
should put himself on such terms of 
evident intimacy. Especially in this 
hyperactive atmosphere, where 
people who had been posturing 
ihreat gestures at each other all day 
were now laughing and mingling 
and drinking together. Not only 
lhat. Every person in this little group 
was from a rival bloc. What would 
(he head of her delegation say? Sir 
Tam and the Saudi were Power. 
The Uruguayans were People. So 
were the two jolly Chinese women 
in their spike-heeled shoes and 
neo-Mao jackets of silk brocade and 
metal thread. “You’ll never guess. 
Nan,” grinned Sir Tam, after intro- 
ducing her, “what our friends have 
up their sleeves for tomon-ow. Tell 
her. Liao-tsen.” 

The older of the Chinese women 
laid her hand on Ana’s arm. smil- 
ing. Clearly she had been drinking a 
great deal. Her consonants were 
luzzy, but she said comprehensibly 
enough: “The People's Republic of 
Bengal will put forward an 
emergency resolution. It is a very 
pretty resolution. Miss Dimitrova. 
All about ‘the alleged multinational 
expedition of the Food Exporting 
Powers' and their ‘acts of violence 
against the natives of Son of 
Kung.’ 




“Violence? What is this about 
violence?” demanded Nan, startled 
and suddenly fearful. If there were 
fighting on Kungson — If Ahmed 
found himself in the middle of a 
war — 

“That’s the funny part, dear 
girl,” chuckled Sir Tam. ‘‘It seems 
your friend God’s little junket has 
begun shooting down harmless bal- 
loonists. But not to worry. I don’t 
think it’s going to pass. It’s not a 
party matter, is it, Senor Cor- 
rubias?” 

The Uruguayan shrugged. “There 
has been no official consultation 
among the people’s Republics, that 
is true. ” 

“And unofficial?” Gulsmit 
probed. 

Corrubias glanced at the elder 
Chinese woman, who nodded per- 
mission, and said, “I can tell you 
my personal opinion, and that is 
that the acts of violence we have 
heard described are not of much 
importance. Can one really get 
upset about rubber jack-o ’-lanterns 
floating around in the sky?” 

“There is also the matter of the 
underground race,” said the 
Chinese woman. She took another 
sip of her drink, looking merrily 
mysterious over the top of it at Sir 
Tam, before going on comfortably, 
“But that too — Well. A few bur- 
rows broken into, that’s all. After 
all, how can we be sure that the 
creatures who inhabit them are in- 
deed intelligent? We would not ob- 
ject to a Nebraska farmer, for 
example, opening a mole run as he 
plowed his com paddies.” 

“One might also,” said Ana 
boldly, surprising herself at the 
harshness of her voice, “speak of 



the crustacean race which has suf- 
fered some casualties.” But Sir 
Tam stopped her by a gentle pres- 
sure on the shoulder. She did not 
protest. She had suddenly realized 
that it was Ahmed’s group that had 
caused those casualties, about which 
she knew so worry ingly little. 

“I would really enjoy watching 
you two fight it out," said Sir Tam, 
laughing to take the menace out of 
his words. But Nan wondered if he 
didn’t really mean it. She also won- 
dered why he was so carefully and 
publicly possessive of her, arm 
around her shoulder, hovering over 
her drink and refilling it from every 
passing tray. Surely all these 
foreign people would suppose they 
had been in bed together! She 
blushed at the thought. It would 
have been bad enough to be guilty 
of an immoral dalliance, like any 
common tart, and to have it known. 
But she was not even guilty! The 
name without the game, how awful! 
Why would Sir Tam go out of his 
way to create such an impression? 
Could it be that the lax morality of 
the Fuel people was such that he 
valued the appearance of sexual ad- 
venture as much as the relationship 
itself? Was he trying to show that 
he was still sexually potent? And 
what sort of person was she living 
among here? 

“Please excuse me for a mo- 
ment,” she said, glancing about as 
though looking for a woman’s w.c. 
But as soon as she was well away 
from Sir Tam, she circled around the 
white-paneled room to the buffet ta- 
bles. At least she would bring up 
her blood sugar. Perhaps that would 
relieve the headaches and the 
exhaustion, and then she would 



56 



GALAXY 




think of a way to relieve the pres- 
sure from Sir Tam. 

The table would have been lavish 
even in Sofia! But was it not the 
Tibetans who were giving this 
party? And why did they feel 
obliged to spread so wasteful a dis- 
play of food? Caviar which cer- 
tainly did not come from the 
Himalayas. Delicate fruit ices that 
surely were unknown in their 
sparse, high valleys. Pates in the 
original wooden boxes from France. 
And look what they had done! The 
centerpieces were carved replicas of 
the races of Kungson! A balloonist, 
half a meter thick, in butter! A crus- 
tacean carved from what looked like 
strawberry sherbet! A long, al- 
most ratlike creature — was it a 
burrower? — made from foie-gras! 
And there standing next to her was 
a distinguished looking gray-haired 
man who was directing a pale- 
haired younger man in filling a 
plate from the display. A spoonful 
of the burrower, a few slices of 
some sort of meat, a croissant, a 
scoop from the balloonist to butter 
the roll. He caught her eye and 
smiled pleasantly without speaking. 

It was all incredibly ostentatious. 
It quite took Ana’s appetite away. 
She looked away from the food and 
saw Sir Tam across the room, eyes 
on her. Strangely, he nodded en- 
couragement and pointed — to 
whom? To the graying tall man next 
to her? 

She looked more carefully. Had 
they ever met? No. But he had a 
face she seemed to know. From a 
photograph, she thought; but a 
photograph that had meant some- 
thing to her. 

She turned to speak to him, and 



the pale-haired other man was sud- 
denly between them, polite but in a 
state of readiness. For what? Did 
they think she was an assassin? 

Then she remembered where she 
had seen the face. “You’re Mr. 
Godfrey Menninger, ” she said. 

His expression was inquiring. 
“Yes?” 

“We’ve never met, but I’ve seen 
your picture in a newspaper. With 
your daughter. I’m Ana Dimitrova, 
and I met your daughter a few 
months ago in Sofia.” 

“Of course you did! The angel of 
rescue. It’s all right, Teddy,” he 
said to the younger man, who step- 
ped back and began col- 
lecting silverware for Menninger’s 
plate. “How nice to meet you at 
last. Ana. Margie’s here some- 
where. Not near the food, poor 
thing. She has her mother’s 
metabolism. She can’t even look at 
a layout like this without putting on 
a kilo. Let's go find her so you can 
say hello.” 

Captain Menninger was sipping 
her Perrier water and allowing a 
fifty-year-old Japanese attache to 
think he was making headway 
against her defenses when she heard 
her father’s voice behind her. 
“Margie, dear. A surprise for you. 
You remember Ana Dimitrova?” 
“No.” Marge studied the woman 
carefully, not competitively, but in 
the manner of someone trying to 
learn a terrain from a map. Then 
the card file in her head clicked 
over. “Yes,” she corrected herself. 
“The Bulgarian woman. How nice 
to see you again. ” 

It was not anything of the kind, 
and she intended the Bulgarian bint 
to understand that. On the other 



JEM 



57 




hand, Margie had no particular wish 
to make an enemy of her either. 
There might be a time when her 
connection with that Pak she was 
screwing — Dulla? Yes. Ahmed 
Dulla, member of the first Peeps 
expedition to Klong — could be a 
useful line to pursue. So she turned 
to the Japanese and said: 

“Tetsu, I’d like you to meet Nan 
Dimitrova. She was such a help to 
me in Bulgaria. You know how 
foolish I am about making jokes, I 
just can't help this mouth of mine, 
it says things that get me into the 
most terrible trouble. And so, of 
course, I said something ridicul- 
ously awful. Political, you know. It 
could have had really sticky con- 
sequences. And along came Nan, 
total stranger, just a good person, 
and got me out of it. How is that 
nice young man you were with. 
Nan?” 

“Ahmed is on Kungson,” said 
Nan. She was unwilling to give 
offense, but she was not obliged to 
like this plump blonde’s nasty little 
put-down games. 

“Is he! Why, that’s a coinci- 
dence. You remember Dr. 
Dalehouse, of course? He’s there 
too. Perhaps they’ll meet.” She saw 
that her father’s aide had just sig- 
naled something to him, and added, 
“Daddy, you’re looking worried. 
Am I saying something awful 
again?” 

Godfrey Menninger smiled. 
“What I’m worried about is that if 
I’m going to give you a lift to Bos- 
ton, it’s time we were on our way. 
You do remember you have a date 
at M.I.T. tonight?” 

“Oh, dear. I’d forgotten.” 
Wholly untrue; Margie had not for- 

58 



gotten the time of her date, which 
was the following morning, and she 
had no doubt that her father had not 
forgotten either. 

“Also,” he went on, “you’ll be 
sneezing and scratching if we stay 
here much longer. Or had you also 
forgotten that you are allergic to 
flowers?” 

Margie had never in her life been 
allergic to anything, but she said, 
“You do take such good care of 
me, Daddy. Nan, I’m sorry this was 
so short, but it’s really nice seeing 
you again. And, Tetsu, don’t be a 
stranger next time you’re in Hous- 
ton. Stop by and say hello.” The 
Japanese hissed and bowed. Of 
course, Margie reflected, she could 
be out of town if he ever did hap- 
pen to show up in Houston. Not 
that that mattered. She had already 
accomplished her objective. Past a 
certain age, even going to bed with 
a man did not give you quite as 
firm a grip on his emotions as 
communicating the impression that 
you certainly would like to, if you 
ever got the chance. 

In her father’s car, with the 
bodyguard-aide sitting in front, she 
said, “Now what was that all 
about, poppa?” 

“Maybe your little Bulgarian 
friend isn’t quite as much of a coun- 
try girl as she seems. Teddy swept 
her as a matter of routine. There 
was a microphone in her corsage.” 

“Her? Bugged? That’s a crock!” 

“That’s a fact,” he corrected, 
“Maybe her delegation put it on 
her, who knows? That place was 
full of sharks. It could have been 
anyone of them. And speaking of 
sharks — ” 

“You want to know what I 
GALAXY 




picked up,” she said, nodding, and 
told him what the Japanese had said 
about the Bengali resolution. 

He leaned back in the seat. “Just 
the usual U.N. Mischief Night, I’d 
say. You turn over my garbage can, 
I throw a dead cat on your roof. 
Are they going to press it?” 

“He didn’t say, poppa. He didn’t 
seem to take it very seriously.” 

Her father rubbed the spot below 
his navel thoughtfully. “Of course, 
with the Peeps you never know. 
Heir-of-Mao has an investment in 
Klong. The Bengalis wouldn’t be 
starting anything they didn’t clear 
with the Forbidden City.” 

Margie’s hair prickled erect at the 
back of her neck. “Are you saying 
I should worry? I don’t want my 
mission withdrawn!” 

“Oh, no, no chance of that, 
honey. Relax, will you? You’re too 
much like your old lady. She never 
did learn to swing with the action. 
When the P.L.O. kidnapped you, I 
thought she’d have a nervous 
breakdown.” 

“She was scared shitless, poppa. 
And you never turned a hair.” Not 
even, she thought, when your own 
three-year-old daughter was bawling 
into the jetliner’s radio. 

“But I knew you were going to 
be all right, honey. I really did.” 
“Well, I’m not bringing that up 
again, oT buddy.” Margie folded 
her hands in her lap and stared out 
the window. Between the U.N. 
complex and the airport there was 
no building, no street, that Margie 
had not seen a dozen times before. 
She was not really seeing them 
now. But they helped spur and 
clarify her thoughts, the long tan- 
dem buses hobbling down the slow 



lanes, the apartment dwellers walk- 
ing their dogs, school kids, stores, 
police on their tricycles, sidewalk 
vendors with their hand-made 
jewelry and pocket computers. 
Thomas Jefferson might have 
looked out of his stagecoach as he 
returned to Monticello at the slaves 
weeding his crops in just the same 
detached but proprietary way. 

She said slowly, “Listen, poppa. 
I want to get our mission rein- 
forced. Now.” 

“What’s the hurry?” 

“I don’t know, but there’s a 
hurry. I want it done defore the 
Peeps and the Greasies cut us off at 
the roots, or get enough of their 
own people up there to own 
Kungson. I want us there first and 
biggest, because I want it all.” 
“Shit, honey. Didn’t they teach 
you about priorities at the Point? 
There’s the krill business, and the 
mid-Atlantic Ridge, and the 
Greasies threatening to raise their 
prices again — do you have any idea 
how tough all this is? I’ve only got 
one stack, and there’s only room for 
one thing at the top of it. ” 

“No, poppa, I don’t want to be 
told how hard it is. Don’t you un- 
derstand this is a whole planet?” 
“Of course I do, but — ” 

“No. No buts. I guess you don’t 
really understand what having a 
whole planet to play with means. 
For us, poppa, all for us. To start 
from scratch with. To develop in a 
systematic manner. Find all the fos- 
sil fuels, develop them in a rational 
way. Locate the cities where they 
don’t destroy arable land. Plant 
crops where they won’t damage the 
soil. Develop industry where it’s 
most convenient. Plan the popula- 



JEM 



59 




tion. Let it grow as it is needed, but 
not to where you have a surplus: 
good, strong, self-reliant people. 
American people, poppa. Maybe the 
place stinks now, but give it a 
hundred years and you’d rather be 
there than here, I promise. And l 
want it." 

Godfrey Menninger sighed, look- 
ing in love and in some awe at the 
oldest and most troublesome of his 
children. “You’re worse than your 
mother ever was,” he said ruefully. 
“Well, I hear what you say. The 
Poles owe us one. I’ll see what I 
can do. ”

TechTowTwo sprawled over the 
bank of the Charles River, more 
than twice the cubage of all the old 
brick buildings put together. There 
were no classrooms in Tech Tower 
Two. There was no administration, 
either. It was all for research, from 
the computer storage in the sub- 
basements to the solar-radiation ex- 
periments that decorated the roof 
with saucers and bow-ties. 

The Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology had a long tradition of 
involvement with space exploration, 
going back even before there was 
any. Or any that did not take place 
on a printed page. As early as the 
1950s there had been a design 
class whose entire curriculum re- 
volved around the creation of prod- 
ucts for export to the inhabitants of 
the third planet of the star Arcturus. 
The fact that there was no known 
planet of Arcturus, let alone in- 
habitants of it, did not disturb either 
teacher or students. Techpersons 
were used to unhinging their imagi- 



nations on demand. In the Cam- 
bridge community that centered 
around M.I.T., Harvard, the Garden 
Street observatories and all the 
wonderlands of Route 128, there had 
been designers of interstellar 
spacecraft before the first Sputnik 
went into orbit, anatomists of ex- 
traterrestrials when there was no 
proof of life anywhere off the sur- 
face of the Earth, and specialists in 
interplanetary communications be- 
fore anyone was on the other end of 
the line. Margie Menninger had 
taken six months of graduate studies 
there, dashing from Tech to Har- 
vard. She had been careful to keep 
her contacts bright. 

The woman Margie wanted to see 
was a former president of the MIS- 
FITS and thus would have been a 
power in the Tech world even if she 
had not also held the title of Assist- 
ant Dean of the College. She had 
arranged a breakfast meeting at 
Margie’s request, and had turned 
out five department heads on order. 

The Dean introduced them around 
the table and said, “Make it good 
now, Margie. Department heads 
aren’t crazy about getting up so 
early in the morning.” 

Margie sampled her scrambled 
eggs. “For this kind of food I don’t 
blame them,” she said, putting 
down her fork. “Let me get right to 
it. I have about ten minutes’ worth 
of holes of the autochthones of Son 
of Rung, alias Klong. No sound. 
Just visible.” She leaned back to 
the sideboard and snapped a switch, 
and the first of the holographic pic- 
tures condensed out of a pinkish 
glow. “You’ve probably seen most 
of this stuff anyway,” she said. 
“That’s a Krinpit. They are one of 



60 



GALAXY 




the three intelligent, or anyway pos- 
sibly intelligent, races on Klong, 
and the only one of the lot that is 
urban. In a moment you’ll see some 
of their buildings. They’re open at 
the top. Evidently the Krinpit don’t 
worry much about weather. Why 
they have buildings at all is any- 
one's guess, but they do. They 
would seem much the easiest of the 
three races to conduct trade with, 
but unfortunately the Peeps have a 
head start with them. No doubt 
we’ll catch up. ” 

The head of the design staff was 
a lean young black woman who had 
limited her breakfast to orange juice 
and black coffee, and was already 
through with it. “Catch up at what, 
Captain Menninger?” she asked. 

Margie took her measure and re- 
fused combat. “For openers. Dr. 
Ravenel, I’d like to see your people 
create some trade goods. For all 
three races. They’re all going to be 
our customers one of these days.” 

The economist took his eyes off 
the holo of a Krinpit coracle to 
challenge Margie. “Customers im- 
plies two-way trade. What do you 
think these, ah, Klongans are going 
to have to sell us that’s worth the 
trouble of shipping it all those 
light-years?” 

Margie grinned. “I thought you’d 
never ask.” She pulled an attache 
case off the floor and opened it on 
the table in front of her, pushing the 
plate of eggs out of the way. “So 
far,” she said, “we don’t exactly 
have any manufactured objects. But 
take a look at this.” She passed 
around several ten-centimeter 
squares of a filmy, resilient sub- 
stance. “That’s the stuff the bal- 
loonists’ hydrogen sacs are made 



out of. It’s really pretty special 
stuff — I mean, it holds gaseous H;, 
with less than one per cent leakage 
in a twenty-four hour period. We 
could supply quite a lot of that, if 
there was a specialty market for it . ” 

“Don’t you have to kill a bal- 
loonist to get it?" 

“Good question,” Margie nod- 
ded to the economist, with a lying 
smile. “Actually, no. That is. there 
are other, non-sentient races with 
the same body structure, although 
this one is, I believe, from one of 
the sentients. How about a market? 
If I remember correctly, the Ger- 
mans had to use the second stomach 
of the ox when they were building 
the Hindenburg. ” 

“I see,” said the economist 
gravely. “All we need to do is con- 
tact a few Zeppelin manufacturers.” 
There was a general titter. 

“I’m sure,” said Margie steadily, 
“that you will have some better 
idea than that. Oh, and I ought to 
mention one thing. I brought my 
checkbook. There’s a National Sci- 
ence Foundation grant for research 
and development that’s waiting for 
someone to apply for it.” And for 
that gift too, I thank you, poppa, 
she thought. 

The economist had not become 
the head of a major department of 
the faculty without learning when to 
retreat. “I didn’t mean to brush you 
off, Captain Menninger. This is ac- 
tually a pretty exciting challenge. 
What else have you got for us?” 

“Well, we have a number of 
samples that haven’t been studied 
very carefully. Frankly, they aren’t 
really supposed to be here. Camp 
Detrick doesn’t know they’re gone 
yet.”

The group stirred. The Dean said 
quickly, “Margie, I think we all get 
the same picture when you mention 
Camp Detrick. Is there anything 
connected with biological warfare in 
this?” 

“Certainly not! No, believe me, 
that doesn’t come into it at all. I 
sometimes go out of channels, I 
admit, but what do you guess 
they'd do to me if I broke security 
on something like that?” 

“Then why Camp Detrick?” 
“Because these are alien or- 
ganisms,” Margie explained. “Ex- 
cept for the sample of balloonist tis- 
sue, you’ll notice that every item 
I’ve got here is in a double- 
wrapped, heat-sealed container. The 
outside has been acid-washed and 
UV-sterilized. No, wait — ” she 
added, grinning. Everybody at the 
table had begun looking at their fin- 
gertips, and there was a perceptible 
movement away from the samples 
of tissue on the table. “Those bal- 
loonist samples are okay. The rest, 
maybe not so okay. They’ve been 
pretty carefully gone over. There 
don’t seem to be any pathogens or 
allergens. But naturally you’ll want 
to use care in handling them.” 
“Thanks a lot. Captain,” said the 
designer stiffly. “How can you be 
so sure about the tissue?” 

“I ate some three days ago,” she 
said. She had their full attention 
now, and swept on: “I should point 
out that the grant naturally includes 
whatever you need to insure safe 
handling. Now, this group are plant 
samples. They’re photosynthetic, 
and their principal response is in the 
infrared range. Interesting for you 
agronomists? Right. And these over 
here are supposed to be art objects. 



These come from the Krinpit, the 
ones that looked like squashed cock- 
roaches. The things are supposed 
to ‘sing.’ That is, if you’re a Krin- 
pit and you rub them on your shell 
they make some interesting sounds. 
If you don’t have a chitinous shell, 
you can use a credit card. ” 

The woman from Design picked 
up one of them gingerly, peering at 
it through the transparent plastic. 
“You said you wanted us to de- 
velop some kind of trading goods?” 

“I sure do.” The last thing Mar- 
gie pulled out of her dispatch case 
was a red-covered mimeographed 
document. The words MOST SE- 
CRET were dazzle-printed on the 
jacket. “As you can see, this is 
classified, but that’s just military 
hangups. It will be turned over to 
the U.N. in about ten days anyway, 
or most of it will. It’s the most 
comprehensive report we’ve been 
able to prepare on the three princi- 
pal races of Klong.” 

All six of the faculty members at 
the table reached for it at once, but 
the Design woman was fastest. 
“Um,” she said, flipping through 
it. “I’ve got a graduate student who 
would eat this up. Can I show it to 
him?” 

“Better than that. Let’s leave this 
copy, and the samples, with our 
friends, and let’s you and I go talk 
to him.” 

Fifteen minutes later, Margie had 
succeeded in getting rid of the de- 
partment head, and she and a slim, 
excitable young man named Walter 
Pinson were head to head. “Think 
you can handle it?” asked Margie. 

“Yes! I mean, well, it’s a big 
job — ” 



62 



GALAXY 




Margie put her hand on his arm. 
“I’m sure you can. I’d really ap- 
preciate it it you’d tell me how you 
plan to go about it, though.” 

Pinson thought for a moment. 
“Well, the first thing is to figure 
out what their needs are,” he 
offered. 

“That’s fascinating! It must be 
pretty difficult. I would hardly 
know where to start. Offhand, I’d 
say their biggest need, all of them, 
is just staying alive. As you’ll see, 
everything on the planet spends a 
lot of its time trying to eat every- 
thing else, including the other in- 
telligent races. ” 

“Cannibalism?” 

“Well, I don’t think you can call 
it that. They’re different races. And 
there are a lot of other species that 
are trying to eat the intelligent 
ones.” 

“Predators,” said Pinson, nod- 
ding.” Well, there’s a starting point 
right there. Let’s see. For the preda- 
tors like the balloonists, for in- 
stance, anything that would set 
them on fire would help protect the 
sentients — of course,” he added, 
frowning, “we’d have to make sure 
that these were used only to defend 
the sentients against lower forms of 
life.” 

“Of course!” said Margie, 
shocked. “We wouldn’t want to 
give them weapons to start a war 
with!” She glanced at her watch. 
“I've got an idea, Walter. I didn’t 
have much of a breakfast, and it’s 
getting on toward lunch. Why don’t 
you and I go where we can talk 
about these, ah, implements for 
self-protection?”

When she got back to her hotel, 
there was a taped message from her 
father: “To hear is to obey. Catch a 
news broadcast.” 

She turned on the bedside TV 
while she packed, hunting for an 
all-news station. She was rewarded 
with five minutes about the latest 
Boston political corruption scandals, 
and then an in-depth interview with 
the Red Sox’s new designated hit- 
ter. But at last there was a recap of 
the top international story of the 
day: 

“In a surprise move at the United 
Nations this morning, the top Polish 
delegate, Wladislas Prczensky, an- 
nounced that his government has 
accepted the challenge presented by 
the Bengali resolution. The Food 
powers have agreed to send out an 
investigatory commission, given 
broad powers to investigate the al- 
leged cases of brutal treatment of 
native races on the planet whimsi- 
cally called ‘Klong,’ or ‘Son of 
Rung.’ There will be no representa- 
tives of major powers such as the 
United States or the Soviet Union on 
the commission, which will be 
made up of U.N. peacekeeping 
officers from Poland itself, Brazil, 
Canada, Argentina and Bulgaria.”

Danny Dalehouse reached out to 
grab the theodolite as it tipped in 
the soft ground. Morrissey grinned 
and apologized. “Must’ve lost my 
balance. ” 

“Or else you’re stoned again,” 
said Dalehouse. He was angry — not 
just at Morrissey. In the candor of 
his heart he knew that most of his 
anger was at the fact that Kap- 



JEM 



63 




pelyushnikov was flying and he was 
not. “Anyway,” he went on, 
“you’ve knocked this run in the 
head. Next time why don’t you just 
go sleep it off?” 

They had all been freaked out by 
the stuff the balloonists had sprayed 
on them, and from time to time, for 
days afterward, all of them had re- 
curring phases of lust and euphoria. 
Morrissey’s were not only more in- 
tense, but Dalehouse was pretty 
sure the biochemist was still expos- 
ing himself. He had discovered that 
something in the semen or sperm of 
the male balloonists was highly 
hallucinogenic — better than that, 
was the long-sought-after true aph- 
rodisiac, fabled in song and story. It 
wasn’t Morrissey’s fault that his re- 
searches put him clear out of it 
from time to time. But he shouldn’t 
have insisted on helping with the 
theodolite readings. 

Far overhead Kappelyushnikov’s 
cluster of bright yellow balloons gy- 
rated as the pilot experimented with 
controlling his altitude to take ad- 
vantage of the winds at various 
levels. When he was finished track- 
ing them, they would have basic in- 
formation that could allow them to 
cruise the skies. Then Dalehouse ’s 
turn would come. But he was tired 
of waiting. 

“Cappy,” he said into the radio, 
“we’ve lost the readings. Might as 
well come on down.” 

Harriet was walking toward them 
as Kappelyushnikov’s answer came 
through. It was in Russian; Harriet 
heard, and flinched irritably. That 
was in character. She had been a 
perfect bitch about the whole thing, 
Dalehouse thought. When they 
came back to normal after that first 



incredible trip, she had flamed at 
him: “Animal! Don’t you know you 
could have got me pregnant?” It 
had never occurred to him to ask. 
Nor had it occurred to her, at the 
time. It was no use reminding her 
that she had been as eager as he. 
She had retreated into her hard 
defiant- spinster shell. And ever 
since she had been ten times as up- 
right as before, and fifty times as 
nasty to anyone who made sexual 
remarks in her presence or even, as 
with Kappelyushnikov just now, 
used some perfectly justifiable bad 
language. 

“I’ve got some new tapes for 
you,” Harriet sniffed. 

“Any progress?” 

“Certainly there’s progress, 
Dalehouse. There’s a definite 
grammar. I’ll brief the whole camp 
on it after the next meal.” She 
glanced up at Cappy, having a last 
fling with his balloon as half a 
dozen of the Klongan gasbags 
soared around him, and retreated. 

A definite grammar. 

Well, there was no use trying to 
hurry Harriet. Preliminary Studies 
on a First Contact with Sub- 
technological Sentients seemed very 
far away! Dalehouse counted up the 
score. It was not impressive. They 
had made no contact at all with the 
crablike things called Krinpit, or 
with the borrowers . The gasbags 
had been hanging around quite a 
lot since the day they had 
showered the expedition with their 
milt. But they did not come close 
enough for the kind of contact 
Danny Dalehouse wanted. They 
bounced and swung hundreds of 
meters in the air most of the time, 
descending lower only when most 



64 



GALAXY 




of the camp was away, or asleep. 
No doubt they had been trained to 
avoid ground-limited creatures 
through eons of predation. But it 
made it hard for Danny. 

At least, with the gasbags in 
sight, rifle microphones had been 
able to capture quite a lot of their 
strident, singing dialogue — if 
dialogue was what it was. Harriet 
said she detected structure. Harriet 
said it was not bird songs, or cries 
of alarm. Harriet said she would 
teach him to speak to them. But 
what Harriet said was not always to 
be believed, Danny Dalehouse 
thought. The other thing he thought 
was that they needed a different 
translator. The split-brain operation 
facilitated language learning, but it 
had several drawbacks. It some- 
times produced bad physical effects, 
including long-lasting pain. Once in 
a while it produced personality 
changes. And it didn’t always work. 
A person who had no gift for lan- 
guages to begin with came out of 
surgery still lacking the gift. In Har- 
riet’s case, Danny would have 
guessed all three were true. 

They had transmitted all the tapes 
to Earth anyway. Sooner or later the 
big semantic computers at Johns 
Hopkins and Texas A&M would be 
checking in, and Harriet’s skills, or 
lack of them, would stop mattering 
so much. 

What Danny needed, or at least 
what Danny wanted, so badly he 
could taste it, was to be up there in 
the sky with one of the gasbags, 
one on one, learning a language in 
the good old-fashioned way. Any- 
thing else was a compromise. 
They’d tried everything within their 
resources. Free-floating instru- 



mented balloons with sensors 
programmed to respond to the sig- 
natures of life; wolf traps for the 
Krinpit; buried microphones for the 
burro wen;; the rifle mikes and the 
zoom-lensed cameras for the gas- 
bags. They had kilometers of tape, 
with pictures and sounds of all 
manner of jumping, crawling, 
wriggling things, and hardly in all 
the endless hours as much as ten 
minutes that was any use to Danny 
Dalehouse, 

Still, something had been accom- 
plished. Enough for him to have 
composed a couple of reports to go 
back to Earth. Enough even for his 
jealous colleagues at M.S.U. and 
the Double-A-L to pore over ea- 
gerly, even if not enough to satisfy 
Danny. It was still learning, even if 
much of it was negative. 

The first thing to perish was the 
pretty fable of three independent in- 
telligent races living in some sort of 
beneficent cooperation and har- 
mony. There was no cooperation. 
At least, they had seen no signs of 
that, and many to the contrary. The 
burrowers seemed never to interact 
with the others at all. The gasbags 
and the Krinpit did, but not in any 
cooperative or harmonious way. 
The balloonists never touched 
ground, as far as Danny had seen, 
or at least not on purpose. There 
were at least a dozen species that 
enjoyed eating balloonists when 
they could catch them, sleek brown 
creatures that looked a little like 
stub-winged bats, froglike leapers, 
smaller arthropods than the 
Krinpit — not least of them, the 
Krinpit themselves. If a gasbag ever 
drifted low enough for one of them 
to reach it, it was dead. So the en- 



JEM 



65 




tire lives of the balloon- 
ists, from spawn to fodder, were 
spent in the air, and their ulti- 
mate burial was always in the di- 
gestive tract of some ground-bound 
race; so tawdry a fate for so pretty a 
species! 

★ * * 

Kappelyushnikov was coming in, 
low and fast, tossed by the low- 
level winds. He pulled the ripcord 
on his balloon at five meters and 
dropped like a stone, wriggling out 
of the harness to fall free. He tum- 
bled over and over as he landed, 
then got up, rubbing himself, and 
ran to catch the deflated balloon 
cluster as it scudded before the 
breeze. 

Danny winced, contemplating his 
own first flight. The last little bit of 
ballooning was going to be the hard- 
est. He turned to help Cappy pick 
up the fabric, and a rifle-shot next 
to his head made him duck and 
swear. 

He spun around, furious. “What 
the hell are you up to, Morrissey?” 
The biochemist put the rifle at 
shoulder-arms and saluted the 
tumbling form of one of the hover- 
ing gasbags. “Just harvesting 
another specimen, Danny,” he said 
cheerfully. He had judged height 
and wind-drift with precision, and 
the collapsed bag was dropping al- 
most at their feet. “Ah, shit,” he 
said in disgust. “Another female.” 
“Really?” said Danny, staring at 
what looked like an immense erec- 
tion. “Are you sure.” 

“Fooled me too,” Morrissey 
grinned. “No, the ones with the 
schlongs aren’t the males. They 



aren’t schlongs. I mean, they aren’t 
penises. These folks don’t make 
love like you and I, Danny. The 
females sort of squirt their eggs out 
to float around in the air, and then 
the boys come out and whack off 
onto them. ” 

“When did you find all that 
out?” Dalehouse was annoyed; the 
rule of the expedition was that each 
of them shared discoveries as soon 
as they were made. 

“When you were bugged at me 
for being stoned out of my mind,” 
Morrissey said. “I think it has to do 
with the way they generate their 
hydrogen. Solar flares seem to be 
involved. So when they saw our 
lights, they thought it was a flare — 
and that’s when they spawned. Only 
we happened to be underneath and 
so we got sprayed with, uh, 
with — " 

“I know what we got sprayed 
with,” Dalehouse said. 

“Yeah! You know, Danny, when 
I took up this career, they made dis- 
secting specimens sound pretty 
tacky — but every time I go near one 
of the males’ sex glands, I get high. 
I’m beginning to like this line of 
work.” 

“Do you have to kill them all off 
to do it, though? You’ll chase the 
flock away. Then how am I going 
to make contact?” 

Morrissey grinned. He didn’t an- 
swer. He just pointed aloft. 
Dalehouse, in justice, had to con- 
cede the unspoken point. Whatever 
emotions the gasbags had, fear did 
not seem to be among them. Mor- 
rissey had shot down nearly a dozen 
of them, but ever since the first 
contact, the swarm had stayed al- 
most always within sight. Perhaps it 



66 



GALAXY 




was the lights that attracted them. 
In the permanent Klongan twilight, 
there was no such thing as “day.” 
The camp had opted to create one, 
marked by turning on the whole 
bank of floodlights at an arbitrary 
“dawn” and turning them off again 
twelve clock hours later. One light 
always stayed on. To keep off preda- 
tors, they told themselves, but in 
truth it was to keep out the primor- 
dially threatening dark. 

Morrissey picked up the bal- 
loonist. It was still alive, its wrin- 
kled features moving soundlessly. 
Once down, they never uttered a 
sound — because, Morrissey said, 
the hydrogen that gave them voice 
was lost when their bags were 
punctured. But they kept on trying. 
The first one they had shot down 
had lived for more than forty hours. 
It had crept all around the camp, 
dragging its gray and wrinkled bag, 
and it had seemed in pain all of that 
time. Dalehouse had been glad 
when it died at last, was glad now 
when Morrissey plunged the new 
one into a killer bag for return to 
Earth. 

Kappelyushnikov limped up to 
them, rubbing his buttocks. “Is al- 
ways a martyr, first pioneer of 
flight,” he grumbled. “So, Danny 
Dalehouse. You want go up now?” 

An electric shock hit Danny. 
“You mean now?” 

“Sure, why not? Wind isn’t bad. 
I go with, soon as two balloons 
fill.” 

* * * 

It took longer than Dalehouse 
would have thought possible for the 
little pump to fill two batches of 



balloons big enough for human 
passengers — especially since the 

pump was a hastily rigged non- 
sparking compressor that leaked as 
much gas as it squeezed into the 
bags, Dalehouse tried to eat, tried 
to nap, tried to interest himself in 
other projects, and kept coming 
back to gaze at the tethered clusters 
of bags, quietly swelling with hy- 
drogen, constrained by the cord net- 
ting that surrounded them. 

The weather had taken a tum for 
the worse. Clouds covered the sky 
from horizon to horizon, but Kap- 
pelyushnikov was stubbornly op- 
timistic. “Clouds will blow away. 
Is positive skies will be clear.” 
When the first lightening — it was 
actually a pinkening — of sky began 
to show, he said decisively: “Is 
okay now. Strap in, Danny.” 

Mistrustfully, Dalehouse buckled 
himself into the harness. He was a 
taller but lighter man than the Rus- 
sian, and Kappelyushnikov grum- 
bled to himself as he valved off 
surplus hydrogen. “Otherwise,” he 
explained, “you go back to State of 
Michigan, East Lansing, shwoosh! 
But next time, not so much wasting 
gas.” 

The harness had a quick-release 
latch at the shoulders, and 

Dalehouse touched it experimen- 
tally. “No, no! ” screamed Kap- 
pelyushnikov. “You want to pull 
when you are up two hundred me- 
ters, fine, pull! Is your neck. But 
don’t waste gas for nothing.” He 
guided Danny’s hands to the two 
crucial cords. “Is not clamjet, you 
understand? Is free balloon. Clamjet 
uses lift to save fuel. Here is no 
fuel, only lift. Here you go where 
wind goes. You don’t like direction. 



JEM 



67 




you find different wind. Spill water 
ballast, you go up. Spill sauers /off. 
you go down. ” 

Dalehouse wriggled in the har- 
ness. It was not going to be very 
much like sailplaning over the east- 
ern shore of Lake Michigan, where 
there was always a west wind to 
bounce off the bluffs and keep a 
glider aloft for hours. But if the 
Russian could do it, he could do it. 

I hope, he added to himself, and 
said, “All right, I think 1 have the 
hang of it.’’ 

“So let’s go,” cried the Russian, 
grinning as he slipped into his own 
harness. He bent and picked up a 
fair-sized rock, gesturing to Danny 
to do the same. The other members 
of the expedition were standing 
back, but one of them handed 
Danny a rock and, at Kap- 
pelyushnikov’s orders, they un- 
tethered the balloons. 

Kappelyushnikov danced over 
toward Danny, like a diver stilting 
across a sea-bottom. He came as 
close as he could under the bulk of 
their balloons, peering into his face. 
“You are all right?” Danny nod- 
ded. “So drop the rock and we 
go!” Kappelyushnikov cried. And 
he cast his own rock away and 
began to float diagonally upward. 

Dalehouse took a deep breath and 
followed his example, watching the 
Russian move upward. 

Nothing seemed to happen. 
Danny did not feel any acceleration, 
only that his feet seemed to have 
gone abruptly numb, and there was 
no sensation of pressure on their 
bottoms. Because his eyes were on 
Kappelyushnikov, he neglected to 
look down until he was fifty meters 
in the air. 



They were drifting south, along 
the coastline. Far above them and 
inland, over the purple hills that 
marked the edge of the fern forest, 
the extended swarm of balloonists 
was grazing on whatever tiny or- 
ganisms they could find floating in 
the sky. Below and behind was the 
dwindling campsite. Danny was al- 
ready higher than the nose of their 
return rocket, the tallest object in it. 
Off to his left was the sea itself, 
and a couple of islands in the 
muddy waters, covered with many- 
trunked trees. 

He wrenched his attention away 
from sightseeing; Kappelyushnikov 
was shouting at him. “What?” 
Dalehouse bellowed. The gap had 
widened; Cappy was now forty 
meters above him, and moving in- 
land, evidently in a different air 
layer. 

"Drop . little . water!’’ 
shouted the Russian. 

Dalehouse nodded and reached 
tentatively for the valve cord. He 
pulled at it with a light touch. 

Nothing happened. 

He pulled again, harder. Half a 
liter of ballast sprayed out of the 
tank, drenching him. Danny had not 
realized that the passenger was di- 
rectly under the ballast tank, and, 
gasping, vowed to change that ele- 
ment of design before he went up 
again. 

But he was flying! 

Not easily. Not with grace. Not 
even with the clumsy control that 
Kappelyushnikov had taught him- 
self. He spent the first hour chasing 
Cappy across the sky. It was like 
one of the fun-house games where 
you and your girl are on different 
rotating circles of a ride, when 



68 



GALAXY 




neither of you can take a step ex- 
cept to change from one spinning 
disk to another. He never caught the 
Russian, though Kappelyushnikov 
did all he could to make capture 
easy. Not that first time. 

But — flying! It was exactly the 
dream he had always had, the 
dream everyone has had. The total 
conquest of the air. No jets. No 
wings. No engines. Just gently 
swimming through the atmospheric 
ocean, with no more effort than 
floating in a salt-water bay. 

He reveled in it, and as time 
went on — not in the first flight, or 
the tenth; but the supply of hydro- 
gen was limitless, if slow in com- 
ing, and he made as many flights as 
he could — he began to acquire some 
skill. 

And the problem of reaching the 
gasbags turned out to be no problem 
at all. 

He didn’t have to seek them out. 
They were far more skilled at flying 
than he, and they came to him, 
bobbing around like great jack-o’- 
lantems with hideous ticklike faces, 
peering inquisitively into his own 
face and singing, singing, oh! how 
they sang. 

* * * 

For the next week, or what 
passed on Klong for a week, 
Dalehouse spent every minute he 
could in the air. The life of the 
camp went on almost without him. 
Even Kappelyushnikov was more 
earthbound than he. There was noth- 
ing to hold Dalehouse there, and 
he found himself almost a stranger 
when he landed, slept, relieved 
bladder and bowels, ate, filled his 



balloons and soared again. Harriet 
snapped at him for demanding more 
than she could handle in translation. 
The camp commander complained 
bitterly at the waste of power in 
generating hydrogen. Jim Morrissey 
pleaded for time and help in collect- 
ing and studying the other species. 
Even Cappy was surly about the 
wear and tear on his balloons. 
Danny didn’t care. In the skies of 
Klong he was alive. He progressed 
from feckless interloper to skilled 
aeronaut; from stranger to, almost, 
one of the great drifting swarm. He 
began to be able to exchange at 
least rudimentary ideas with some 
of the gasbags, especially the 
biggest of diem — two meters across, 
with a pattern that looked almost 
like a tartan; Danny named him 
“Bonny Prince Charlie,” lacking 
any clue as to what the gasbag 
called itself. Himself. Danny began 
to think of him as almost a friend. 
If it had not been for his physical 
needs, and one other thing, 
Dalehouse would hardly have 
bothered returning to the camp at 
all. 

The one other thing was Harriet. 

He could not do without her help 
in translation. It wasn’t enough. He 
was convinced a lot of it was 
wrong. But it was all he had in the 
endeavor to communicate with these 
beautiful and monstrous creatures of 
the air. He raged to the rest of the 
encampment, and insisted on his 
complaints being relayed to Earth; 
he insulted her almost to the point 
of tears — from eyes that he would 
have sworn had never felt them be- 
fore. It was not enough to suit 
him ... but voyage by voyage, 
hour by hour, some sort of com- 



JEM 



69 




munication began to build up. 

You never knew what part of 
your learning was going to be use- 
ful. Those long sessions of 
Chomsky and transactional gram- 
mar, the critiques of Lorenz and 
Dart, the semesters on territoriality 
and mating rites — none of them 
seemed very helpful in the skies of 
Klong. But he blessed every hour of 
sailplaning, and every evening with 
his local barbershop quartet. The 
language of the gasbags was music. 
Not even Mandarin made such de- 
mands on pitch and tonality as their 
songs. Even before he knew any 
words, he found himself chiming in 
their chorus, and they responded to 
it with, if not exactly welcome, at 
least curiosity. The big plaid one 
even learned to sing Danny 
Dalehouse’s name, as well as he 
could with a soundproducing 
mechanism that was deficient in 
such basic phonemes as the frica- 
tive. 

Danny learned that some of their 
songs were not unlike terrestrial 
birdcalls: there was one for food, 
and several for danger. There 
seemed to be three separate kinds of 
danger, one for danger from the 
ground and two for dangers, but 
evidently different kinds of dangers, 
from the air. One of the terms 
sounded almost Hawaiian, with its 
liquids and glottal stops; that 
seemed to belong to a kind of feral 
gasbag, a shark of the air, that ap- 
peared to be their most dangerous 
natural enemy. 

The other— Dalehouse could not 
be sure, and Harriet was not much 
help, but it appeared to relate to 
danger from above the air; and not 
just danger, but that kind of special 



macho risktaking danger that in- 
volved mortal peril, even death, but 
was infinitely attractive for reasons 
he could not perceive. He puzzled 
over that for hours, making Har- 
riet’s life a living hell. On that 
point, no solution. But the tapes 
went back to Earth, and the com- 
puter matches began to come back, 
and Harriet was able to construct 
sentences for him to say. He sang, 
“I am friend,” and, heart- 
stoppingly, the great cross-hatched 
gasbag he called Charlie responded 
with a whole song: 

‘‘You are, you are, you are 
friend!” And the whole chorus 
joined in. 

The fickle Klongan weather 
cooperated for eight calendar days, 
and then the winds began to rise 
and the clouds rolled in. 

When the winds blew, even the 
gasbags of the swarm had trouble 
keeping station with each other, and 
Danny Dalehouse was blown all 
over the sky. He tried to keep the 
camp in range; and because he did, 
so did the whole swarm. But in the 
effort they were widely separated. 
When he decided to give up at last, 
he called good-by and heard in re- 
sponse the song that seemed to 
mean ‘‘sky danger.” Dalehouse re- 
peated it; it seemed appropriate 
enough, considering the weather. 
But then he became conscious of a 
deep fluttering sound behind the 
whine of the winds. The sound of a 
helicopter. 

Dalehouse abandoned the flock, 
climbed high enough to find a re- 
turn wind, then jockeyed himself 
expertly down through the cross- 
breezes toward the camp. There it 
was, dropping through the frayed

GALAXY 





bottom of a cloud: the Greasy cop- 
ter, with a Union Jack on its tail 
strut. So piofligate of energy! Not 
only did they ship that vast mass 
through tachyon transit, at incredi- 
ble cost, but they had shipped 
enough fuel to allow the pilot to 
take joyrides. And what was it car- 
rying slung between its skids? Some 
other kind of machine! Typical 
Greasy oil-hoggery! 

Danny swore disgustedly at the 
wastefulness of the Greasies. With a 
fraction of the kilocalories they 
poured out in simple inefficiency 
and carelessness, he could have had 
a decent computer, Kap- 
pelyushnikov could long since have 
had his glider, Morrissey could 
have had an outboard motor for his 
boat, and thus a nearly complete 
selection of marine samples by 
now. There was something wrong 



in a world that let a handful of na- 
tions bum off energy so recklessly 
simply because they happened to be 
sitting on its sources. When it was 
gone, they would be as threadbare 
as the Peruvians or the Paks, sure. 
But there was no comfort in that. 
Their downfall would be the 
world's downfall — 

Or at least that world's downfall. 
Maybe something could be worked 
out for this one. Planning. Thought. 
Preparation ahead of time. Control 
of growth, so that scarce resources 
would not be pissed away irrevoca- 
bly on foolishness. A fair division 
of Klong’s treasures, so that no na- 
tion. and no individual could enrich 
himself by starving others. An at- 
tempt to insure equity to all — 
Dalehouse’s train of thought 
snapped as he realized that he had 
been daydreaming. The winds had

carried kkn farther than he in- 
tended, almost out over the sea. He 
vented hydrogen frantically, and 
came down almost in the water, 
falling fast. He picked himself up, 
and watched the ripped cases of the 
balloons floating out of reach in the 
water. Cappy would be furious. 

At least he wouldn’t have to 
carry them on what looked like a 
long walk back up the shore to the 
camp, he thought. It was some con- 
solation, but it didn’t last long. Be- 
fore he was halfway back, it began 
to rain. 

★ ★ ★ 

And it rained. And it rained. It 
was no such ferocious wind- 
slamming storm as had hit them 
soon after the landing, but it lasted 
most tediously and angeringly long, 
far past the point where it was an 
incident, past the time it was an an- 
noyance, to the point, and past the 
point, when it seemed they were all 
sentenced to fat, oily drops turning 
the ground into mud and the camp 
into a steam bath for all the misera- 
ble rest of their lives. There was no 
chance of ballooning. There were 
no native balloonists in sight any- 
way to follow. Kappelyushnikov 
grumpily seamed and filled new bal- 
loons in the hope of better times to 
come. Harriet San tori tongue-lashed 
everyone who came near her. Mor- 
rissey packed samples in his tent 
and pored over mysterious pictures 
and charts, coming out only to stare 
furiously at the rain and shake his 
head. Danny composed long 
tachtran messages to SERDCOM 
and the Double-A-L, demanding 
gifts for his gasbag friends. Krivitin 



and Sparky Cerbo brewed up some 
kind of witches’ brew from the na- 
tive berries and got terribly drunk 
together, and then even more terri- 
bly sick as their bodies strove to de- 
fend themselves against the alien 
Klongan protein traces in the 
popskull. They very nearly died. 
They surely would have, exploded 
Alex Woodring, shaking with 
anger, if they had done any such 
moron’s trick earlier; the first total 
vulnerability had dwindled to reac- 
tions that no longer brought death. 
Only protracted misery. Danny in- 
herited the job of tending them and, 
at Harriet’s angry insistence, of 
packaging samples of their various 
untidy emissions for Jim Morrissey 
to analyze. 

Morrissey was crouched over his 
pictures and diagrams when Danny 
came in, and when his duty was 
explained to him, flatly refused it. 
“Cripes, Danny, I’ve got no 
equipment for that kind of thing. 
Throw those samples in the crapper, 
1 don’t want them. ” 

“Harriet says we must know how 
serious the poisoning is.” 

“We already know that, man. 
They got real sick. But they didn’t 
die. ” 

“Harriet says you can at least 
analyze them.” 

“For what? I wouldn’t know 
what to look for. ’ ’ 

“Harriet says — ” 

“Oh, screw Harriet. ’Scuse me, 
Danny, I didn’t mean to remind you 
of your, uh, indiscretions. Anyway, 
I’ve got something better for us to 
do, now that the rain’s stopping.” 
“It hasn’t stopped, Jim.” 

“It’s slowing down. When it 
does stop, Boyne’s going to be 



72 



GALAXY 




coining around to collect the back- 
hoe I borrowed from him. I want to 
use it first. ” 

“For what?” 

“For digging up some of our 
lightfingered friends.” He pointed 
straight down at the floor of the 
tent. “The ones that swiped Har- 
riet’s radio.” 

“We already tried that.” 

“Yes, we did. We found out that 
the important thing is speed. They’ll 
close up the tunnels faster than 
you’d believe, so we’ve got to get 
in, get moving and get to where 
they are before they have a chance 
to react. We’ll never have a clear 
field to pick them up otherwise — 
unless,” he added offhandedly, 
“we flooded the tunnels with 
cyanide first. Then we could take 
our time.” 

“Is that all you think of, kill- 
ing?” Dalehouse flared. 

“No, no. I wasn’t suggesting it. 1 
was excluding it. I know you don’t 
like killing off our alien brothers.” 
Dalehouse took a deep breath. He 
had seen enough of the balloonists 
to stop thinking of them as prepara- 
tions and learn to consider them, 
almost, people. The burrowers were 
still total unknowns to him, and 
probably rather distasteful — he 

thought of termites and maggots and 
all sorts of vile, crawling things 
when he thought of them. But he 
wasn’t ready for genocide. 

“So what were you suggesting?” 
he asked. 

“I borrowed a backhoe from 
Boyne. I want to use it before he 
takes it back. The thing is, I think I 
know where to dig.” 

He gathered up a clump of the 
papers on the upended footlocker he 

JEM 



was using for a desk and handed 
them over. The sheets on top 
seemed to be a map, which meant 
nothing to Dalehouse, but under- 
neath was a sheaf of photographs. 
He recognized them; they were 
aerial views of the area surrounding 
the camp. Some he had taken him- 
self, others were undoubtedly Kap- 
pelyushnikov’s. 

“There’s something wrong with 
them,” he said. “The colors look 
funny. Why is this part blue?” 

“It’s false-color photography, 
Danny. That batch is in the infra- 
red; the bluer the picture, the 
warmer the ground. Here, see these 
sort of pale streaks? They’re two or 
three degrees warmer than what’s 
on other side of them.” 

Dalehouse turned the pictures 
about in his hands, and then asked, 
“Why?” 

“Well, see if you figure it out 
the same way I did. Look at the one 
under it, in orthodox color You 
took that one. Tum it so it’s 
oriented the same way as the false- 
color print — there. Do you see those 
clumps of orangey bushes? They 
seem to extend in almost straight 
lines. And those bright red ones? 
They are extensions of the same 
lines. The bushes are all the same 
plant; the difference is the bright 
red ones are dead. Well, doesn’t it 
look to you like the pale lines in the 
false-color pictures match up with 
the lines of bushes in the ortho? 
And I’ve poked a probe down along 
some of those lines, and guess what 
I found?” 

“Burrows?” Dalehouse hazarded. 

“You’re so damn smart,” grum- 
bled Morrissey. “All right, show 
me some real smarts. Why are those 

73 




plants and markings related to the 
burrows?” 

Dalehouse put down the pictures 
patiently. “That I don’t know. But 
I bet you’re going to tell me.” 

“Well, no. Not for sure. But I 
can make a smart guess. I’d say 
digging out tunnels causes some 
sort of chemical change in the sur- 
face. Maybe it leaches out the nu- 
trients selectively? And those plants 
happen to be the kind that survive 
best in that kind of soil? Or maybe 
the castings from the burrowers fer- 
tilize them, again selectively. Those 
are analogues from Earth: you can 
detect mole runs that way, and 
earthworms aerate the soil and make 
things grow better. This may be 
some wholly different process, but 
my bet is that that's the general 
idea.” 

He sat back on his folding camp 
stool and regarded Danny anx- 
iously. 

Dalehouse thought for a second, 
listening to the dwindling plop of 
raindrops on the tent roof. “You 
tell me more than I want to know, 
Jim, but I think I get your drift. 
You want me to help you dig them 
up. How are we going to do that 
fast enough? Especially in the kind 
of mud there is out there?” 

“That’s why I borrowed Boyne’s 
backhoe. It’s been in position ever 
since the rain began. I think the 
burrowers sense ground vibrations; I 
wanted them to get used to its being 
there before we started.” 

“Did you tell him what you 
wanted it for? I got the impression 
they were digging burrows them- 
selves.” 

“So did I, and that’s why 1 didn’t 
tell him. I said we needed new 



latrines, and by gosh we do. Some- 
time or other. Anyway, it’s right 
over the best-looking patch of 
bushes right now, ready to go. Are 
you with me?” 

Danny thought wistfully of his 
airborne friends, so much more in- 
viting than these rats or worms. But 
they were out of reach for the time 
being — “Sure,” he said. 

Morrissey grinned, relieved. 
“Well, that was the easy part. Now 
we come up against the tough bit: 
convincing Harriet to go along.” 

★ * * 

Harriet was every bit as tough as 
advertised. “You don’t seriously 
mean,” she began, “that you want 
to drag everybody out in a down- 
pour just for the sake of digging a 
few holes?” 

“Come on, Harriet,” said Mor- 
rissey, trying not to explode. “The 
rain’s almost stopped.” 

“And if it has, there are a 
thousand more important things to 
do!” 

“Will be fun, Gasha,” Kap- 
pelyushnikov chipped in. “Digging 
for foxholes like landed oil-rich 
English country gentlemen! Excel- 
lent sport. ” 

“And it isn’t just a few holes,” 
Morrissey added. “Look at the 
seismology traces. There are big 
things down there, chambers twenty 
meters long and more. Not just tun- 
nels. Maybe cities.” 

Harriet said cuttingly, “Morris- 
sey, if you wonder why none of us 
have any confidence in you, that’s 
just the reason. You’ll say any 
stupid thing that comes into your 
head. Cities! There are some indica- 



74 



GALAXY 




tions of shafts and chambers, 
somewhat bigger than the tunnels 
directly under the surface, yes. But 
I would not call them — ” 

“All right, all right. They're not 
cities. Maybe they aren’t even vil- 
lages, but they’re something. At the 
least, they are something like breed- 
ing chambers where they keep their 
young. Or store their food. Or, 
Christ, I don’t know, maybe it’s 
where they have ballet performances 
or play Bingo, what’s the dif- 
ference? Just because they’re big- 
ger, it follows that they’re probably 
more important. It will be less 
likely, or at least harder, for them 
to seal them off.” 

He looked toward Alex Wood- 
ring, who coughed and said, “I 
think that’s reasonable, Harriet. 
Don’t you?” 

She pursed her lips thoughtfully. 
“Reasonable? No, I certainly 
wouldn’t call it reasonable. Of 
course, you’re our leader, at least 
nominally, and if you think it wise 
to depart from the — ” 

“I do think it’s a good idea, Har- 
riet,” Woodring said boldly. 

“If you’ll let me finish, please? I 
was saying, if you think we should 
depart from the agreement we all 
made that group decisions should be 
arrived at unanimously, not by a 
vote or some one person throwing 
his weight around, then 1 suppose I 
have nothing further to say.” 

“Gasha, dear,” said Kap- 
pelyushnikov soothingly, “shut up, 
please? Tell us plan, Jim.” 

“You bet! First thing we do is 
open up as big a hole as we can 
with the backhoe. All of us are out 
there with shovels, and we jump in. 
What we want is specimens. We 



grab what we see. We should take 
them pretty much by surprise and 
besides,” he said, with some self- 
satisfaction, “two of us can carry 
these.” He held up his camera. 
“They’ve got good bright strobes. I 
got that idea from Boyne, when we 
were drinking together; I think 
that’s what they do, at the 
Greasies’. They go in with these 
things, partly to get pictures and 
mostly to dazzle them. While 
they’re temporarily blinded, we can 
grab them easily.” 

Dalehouse put in, “Temporarily, 
Jim?” 

“Well,” Morrissey said reluc- 
tantly. “No, I’m not real sure about 
that part. Their eyes are probably 
pretty delicate — but hell, Danny, we 
don’t even know if they have any 
eyes in the first place!” 

“Then how do they get daz- 
zled?” 

“All right. But still, that’s the 
way I want to do it. And we’ll take 
walkie-talkies. If anything, uh, goes 
wrong — ” He hesitated, and then 
started over. “If you should get 
disoriented or anything, you just dig 
up. You should be able to do that 
with your bare hands. If not, you 
just turn your walkie-talkie on. We 
might be unable to get voice com- 
munication from under the surface, 
but we know from the radio that got 
stolen that we can at least get car- 
rier sound, so we’ll RDF you and 
dig you out. That’s if anything goes 
wrong." 

Kappelyushnikov leaned forward 
and placed his hand on the 
biochemist’s mouth. “Dear Jim,” 
he said, “please don’t encourage us 
any more, otherwise we all quit. 
Let’s do this, no more talk.” 



JEM

* ★ * 

Predictably, Harriet would have 
nothing to do with the venture, and 
she insisted that at least two of the 
men stay behind— “In case we have 
to dig you heroes out." But Sparky 
Cerbo volunteered to go in, and 
Alicia Dair claimed she could run 
the backhoe better than anyone else 
in the camp. So they had half a 
dozen in coveralls, headlamps, 
goggles and gloves ready to jump in 
w'hen Morrissey signaled the dig- 
ging to start. 

He had been right about the mud; 
there wasn’t any, except right 
around the main paths of the camp, 
where they had trodden the Klongan 
ground-cover to death. But the soil 
was saturated, and the backhoe 
threw as much moisture as it did 
dirt. In less than a minute it had 
broken through. 

Morrissey swallowed, crossed 
himself and jumped into the hole. 
Alex Woodring followed, then 
Danny, then Kappelyushnikov, di 
Paolo, and Sparky Cerbo. 

The plan was to break up into 
pairs, each couple to follow one 
tunnel. The trouble with the plan 
was that it was predicated on there 
being more than two directions to 
take. There weren’t. The pit they 
dropped into was not much more 
than a meter broad. It smelled 
damp, and — and bad, Danny 
thought, like a stale cage of pet 
mice; and it was no more than a 
tunnel. Di Paolo jumped down onto 
Danny’s ankle, and Sparky Cerbo, 
following, got him square in the 
middle of the back. They were all 
tangled together, cursing and 
grumbling, and if there was a bur- 



rower within a kilometer that didn’t 
know they were coming, that bur- 
rower, Danny thought, would have 
to be dead. “Quit screwing 
around!” yelled Morrissey over his 
shoulder. “Dalehouse! Sparky! You 
two follow me.” Dalehouse got 
himself turned around in time to see 
Morrissey’s hips and knees, out- 
lined against the glow from his 
headlamp, moving away. The 
cross-section of the tunnel was more 
oval than round, shallower than it 
was broad; they couldn’t quite move 
on hands and knees, but they could 
scramble well enough on thighs and 
elbows. 

“See anything?” he called ahead. 

“No. Shut up. Listen.” Morris- 
sey’s voice was muffled, but 
Dalehouse could hear it well 
enough. Past it and through it he 
thought he heard something else. 
What' 1 It was faint and hard to iden- 
tify. squirrel-like squeals and rus- 
tlings, perhaps, and larger, deeper 
sounds from farther away. His own 
breath, the rubbing of his gear, the 
sounds the other made, all con- 
spired to drown it out. But there 
was something. 

A bright flare made him blink. It 
hurt his eyes. It came from Morris- 
sey’s strobe, up ahead. All 
Dalehouse got of it was what trick- 
led back, not helped by the rough 
dirt walls, almost without reflec- 
tance. In the other direction it must 
have been startling. Now he was 
sure he heard the squirrel-squeals, 
and they sounded anguished. As 
well they should, Danny realized, 
with a moment’s empathy for the 
burrowers. What could light have 
meant to them, ever, but some pred- 
ator breaking in, and death and de- 



76 



GALAXY 




struction following? 

He bumped into Morrissey’s feet 
und stopped. Over his shoulder, 
Morrissey snarled. “The fuckers! 
They’ve blocked it." 

“The tunnel?" 

“Christ, yes. the tunnel! It's 
packed tight, too. How the hell 
could they do that so fast?" 

Dalehouse had a moment's atavis- 
tic fear. Blocked! And in the other 
direction? He rolled onto his side, 
extinguished his light and peered 
back between his feet down the 
tunnel. Past Sparky’s crouching 
form he could see, he was sure he 
could see, the reassuring dim red 
glow from the Klongan sky. Even 
so, he could feel the muscles at the 
back of his neck tensed up and 
painful with the ancient human ter- 
ror of being buried alive, and he 
suddenly remembered that the direc- 
tion they had taken was the one that 
went under the backhoe. What if its 
weight crushed the roof through and 
pinned them? "Ah, Jim," he 
called. “What do you think? Should 
we get back to the barn?’’ 

Pause. Then, angrily, “Might as 
well, we’re not doing any good 
here. Maybe the guys had better 
luck the other way. ’’ 

But Cappy and the others were 
already outside, helping them out as 
they emerged. They had got only 
eight or nine meters into their tun- 
nel before it was blocked; 
Dalehouse ’s group had gone more 
than twice as far. It came out the 
same in the end, though, Dalehouse 
reflected. Incredible their reactions 
could be so fast! No doubt they had 
been trained into them over endless 
Klongan millenia. Whatever the 
reason, it was not going to be easy 



to collect a specimen, much less try 
to make contact. Danny thought of 
his airborne friends longingly; how 
much nicer to fly to make contact 
than to wiggle through the mud like 
a snake! 

Kappelyushnikov was brushing 
him off; then, more lingeringly, 
doing the same for Sparky Cerbo. 
"Dearest girl,” he said, "you are 
disgracefully filthy! Let us all go 
swim in lake, take our minds off 
troubles.’’ 

Good-naturedly the girl moved 
away from his hand. “Maybe we 
should see what Harriet wants 
first,” she suggested. And, sure 
enough, Harriet was standing at the 
entrance to the headquarters tent, a 
hundred meters away, evidently 
waiting for them to come to her. 

As they straggled up, she looked 
them up and down with distaste. 
"A total failure, I see,” she said, 
nodding. “Of course, that was to be 
expected. ” 

“Harriet.” Jim Morrissey began 
dangerously. 

She raised her hand. “It doesn’t 
matter. Perhaps you’ll be interested 
in what has happened while you 
were gone. ” 

“Harriet, we were only gone 
twenty or thirty minutes!” Morris- 
sey exploded. 

“Nevertheless. First there was a 
tachtran signal. We’re heing rein- 
forced, and so are the Peeps. 
Second — ” She stepped aside to let 
them pass through into the tent. In- 
side, the others who had stayed be- 
hind were clustered, looking, 
Dalehouse thought, curiously self- 
satisfied. “I believe you wanted a 
specimen of those underground 
creatures? We found one trying to 



JEM 



77 




steal some of our supplies. Of 
course, it would have been easier if 
so many of you hadn’t been wasting 
your time on foolishness, so you 
could have helped when we needed 
you — ” 

Kappelyushnikov bellowed. 
“Gasha! Get to point, right now! 
You caught a specimen for us?” 

“OTtourse,” she said. “We put 
him in one of Morrissey’s cages. I 
was quite severely scratched doing 
it, but that’s about what you can 
expect when — ” 

They didn’t let her finish; they 
were all inside and staring. 

The stale mouse-cage smell was a 
thousand times stronger, almost 
choking Danny Dalehouse, but there 
it was. It was nearly two meters 
long, tiny eyes set close together 
above its snout, squeezed tight 
closed in anguish. It was squealing 
softly — Danny almost would have 
said broken-heartedly — to itself. It 
was gnawing at the metal bars of 
the cage and simultaneously scrabbl- 
ing at the plastic flooring with 
duckfoot shaped claws. It was cov- 
ered with a sort of dun-colored 
down, or short fur; it seemed to 
have at least six pairs of limbs, all 
stubby, all clawed, and all incredi- 
bly strong. 

Whatever its teeth were made of, 
they were hard. One of the bars of 
the cage was almost gnawed 
through; and its squeals of pain 
never stopped. 

IX 

The swarm was half fledglings 
now, tiny balloonets that had just 
cast off their parachuting threads of 
silk and now struggled bravely to 



keep up with the great five-meter 
adult spheres. In the constant chorus 
of the swarm, the fledglings’ voices 
were as tiny as their gasbags. Their 
shrill peeping used only the least 
possible amount of hydrogen, to 
preserve their precarious lift balance 
against the few drops in their ballast 
bladders. 

Charlie patrolled majestically 
through the swarm, driving the bulk 
of his body reprovingly against a 
cluster of infant balloonists that 
were singing against the swarm 
melody, rotating his eye-patches to 
scan the skies for ha' aye' i, listening 
to the counter-songs of praise and 
complaint from the other adults of 
the swarm and always, always, 
leading them as they sang. There 
was much praise, and much com- 
plaint. The praise he took for 
granted. To the complaint he at- 
tended with more care, ready either 
to remedy or rebuke. Three females 
sang despairingly of little ones who 
dropped their flying tails too soon, 
or who could not hold their hydro- 
gen and so drifted helplessly down 
to the voracious world below. 
Another pealed a dirge of anger and 
sorrow, blaming the deformed 
fledglings on the Persons of the 
Middle Sun. 

This was just; and Charlie led the 
swarm in a concurrence of sym- 
pathy and advice: “Never — ” 

(Never, never, never, sang the 
chorus) — “never again must we 
breed near the new Suns.” 

The females chorused agreement, 
but some of the males sang in coun- 
terpoint: “But how can we know 
which is real Heaven-Danger and 
which is not? And where may we 
breed at all? The Persons of the 



78 



GALAXY 




Three Suns are under all our air!” 

Charlie’s answering song was 
serene: “I will ask my friend of the 
Middle Sun. He will know.” (He 
will know, he will know, chorused 
the swarm.) 

But a male sang a dire question: 
“And when the swarming rapture is 
on us, will we remember?” 

“Yes,” sang Charlie. “We will 
remember, because we must.” (We 
must, we must.) 

That should have settled it. And 
yet, the song of the swarm was not 
at peace. Undertones buzzed and 
discorded against the dominant 
themes. Even Charlie’s own song 
faltered now and then, and repeated 
itself when it should have burst into 
triumphant new themes. Currents 
were stirring under the surface of 
his mind. They never reached con- 
sciousness; if they had, no power 
could have kept him from express- 
ing them in song. But they were 
there. Worries. Doubts. Puzzles. 
Who were these Persons of the 
Three Suns? Where had they come 
from? They seemed the same, as 
like as any swarms of balloonists. 
Yet Charlie’s friend ’Anny 
’Alehouse had explained that they 
were not the same. 

First there had been the persons 
of the Small Sun. They had seemed 
no more than another species of de- 
vouring Earth-Danger creatures in 
the beginning, although they had 
created a tiny sun almost at once. 
But their camp was almost at the 
limit of Charlie’s range and the 
swarm had not troubled themselves 
about those Persons. 

Then there was the group of 
Charlie’s friend; and, almost at 
once, the third group, the Persons 



of the Big Sun. They were worri- 
some! Their sun was always shining 
brightly, brighter than the Heaven- 
Danger at its brightest. Since it was 
almost the deepest of Charlie’s in- 
stincts to swarm in the direction of 
a bright light, it was actual pain to 
turn and swim away from the Big 
Sun. They had almost been trapped 
when the Persons first arrived— 
when all three of the parties of Per- 
sons of the Suns arrived — because 
each of them came roaring down 
through the air on a pillar of Sun- 
flame, But none had been close 
enough to cause them to swarm. By 
the time the flock had maneuvered 
near, the flames were gone and the 
lights were darkened. Then the Per- 
sons of the Big Sun had sent one of 
them up into the air in the great 
queer thing that fluttered and rattled; 
it was harder than the ha’ aye' i Sky 
Danger, and even more deadly. 
Something about it drew balloonists 
into its swinging claws, and more 
than a dozen of Charlie’s swarm 
had been ripped open and gone flut- 
tering down to ground, helpless, de- 
spairing and silent. Now they 
avoided it in fear and sorrow. Two 
out of three of the groups of New 
Persons, and both to be avoided! 
The one because they killed, the 
other because they did not fly at all, 
were no more than any other 
Ground Danger, would not have 
been thought to be Persons at all — 

Except for ’Anny 'Alehouse. 

Charlie sang of his friend, who 
redeemed his whole race. ’Anny 
’Alehouse and his sometimes com- 
panion, ’Appy: they were Persons! 
They flew as Persons flew, by the 
majesty and the grace of the air it- 
self. It was a sad thing that even 

79

their Middle Sun had flared like a 
true Heaven Danger and caused the 
flock to breed poorly. But it did not 
occur to Charlie to blame Morris- 
sey’s flare on Dalehouse or Kap- 
pelyushnikov; it did not occur to 
him to think of blame at all. When 
Kung flared, the balloonists bred. 
They could not help it. They did 
not try. They had never developed 
defenses against a false flare, lack- 
ing in the actinic radiation that 
helped them make their hydrogen 
and triggered their fertility. They 
had never needed any — until now. 
And they had no way to leant a de- 
fense. 

The swarm was drifting toward a 
swelling cumulus cloud; Charlie 
swelled his singing sac and boomed 
out: “Hive up, my brothers!” ( Hive 
up, hive up, came the answering 
chorus.) “Hive up, sisters and 
mates! Hive up, young and old! 
Watch for ha aye' i in the wet 
shadows! Huddle the little ones 
close! ” 

Every member of the swarm was 
singing full-throatedly now as the 
swarm compacted, swimming into 
the ruddy-pink cottony edges of the 
cloud. They could see each other 
only as ghosts, except for the oldest 
and biggest males, whose luminous 
markings gave them more visibility. 
But they could hear the songs, and 
Charlie and the other senior males 
patrolled the periphery of the 
swarm. If ha'aye’i were there, the 
males could not defend the 
swarm — could not even defend 
themselves to any purpose. But they 
could sing warning, and then the 
swarm would scatter in all direc- 
tions, so that only the slowest and 
weakest would be caught. 



But this time they were lucky. 
There were no killer balloons in the 
cloud, and the swarm emerged in- 
tact. Charlie trumpeted out a song 
of thanksgiving as the flock entered 
clear air again. All joined. Cumulus 
clouds formed at the top of updrafts 
of warm air, and the ha'aye’i often 
sought them out to supplement their 
comparatively weak lift. There was 
always a price; what the ha’aye'i 
gained in speed and control, not to 
mention claws and jaws, they paid 
for in smaller lifting bags, so that 
for them it was always an effort to 
stay in the air. The ha’aye'i were 
sharks of the air. They never slept, 
never stopped moving; and were 
always hungry. 

The swarm was drifting toward 
the heat pole. Charlie rotated his 
eye patches to catch clues of the 
movement of the air. He always 
knew what direction the winds blew 
on each level; he was taught by the 
movement of cloudlets, by the flut- 
tering of dropped fledgling silk, 
most of all by a lifetime of experi- 
ence, so that he did not have to 
think of how to capture a favorable 
wind, he knew, as surely as any 
New Yorker hurrying down Fifth 
Avenue knows the number of the 
next cross street. He did not want to 
stray too far from his friend of the 
Middle Sun, whom he had not seen 
for some time. He trumpeted for the 
swarm to rise a hundred meters. 
The other males took up his song, 
and from all the gas bags, great and 
small, drops of water ballast fell. 
There would be no trouble replacing 
it for the adults, who were naturally 
and automatically catching and 
swallowing the tiny misting of dew 
from their passage through the 



80 



GALAXY 




cloud. The smaller ones made hard 
work of it. But they valiantly re- 
leased swallowed gas into their 
bags, and the females watchfully 
butted the littlest ones higher. The 
swarm stayed together at the new 
level as its drift changed back to- 
ward the direction of the camp of 
the Middle Sun. 

No ha' aye' i in sight. Plenty of 
water on their skins to lick off and 
swallow, part to hold as ballast, 
part to dissociate into the oxygen 
they metabolized and the hydrogen 
that gave them lift. Charlie was 
well content. It was good to be a 
balloonist! He returned to the song 
of thanksgiving. 

They were nearing the edges of 
their territory, and another swarm 
bobbed high above them, a few 
kilometers away. Charlie observed 
them without concern. There was 
no rivalry between swarms. Some- 
times two of them would float side 
by side for long periods, or even 
coalesce. Sometimes when two 
swarms were joined, individuals 
from one would adhere to another. 
No one thought anything of that. 
From that moment they were full 
members of their new swarm, and 
joined in its songs. But it was more 
common that each should stay in its 
own unmarked, but known, volume 
of air. They grazed the pollen fields 
of their own home air without 
coveting that of their neighbors. 
Though after half a dozen breedings 
there might be no single individual 
still alive of the original swarm, the 
swarm itself would still drift 
placidly over the same ten thousand 
square kilometers of ground. One 
place was almost like another. Over 
any one of those square kilometers 



the sustaining air was always 
around them. The pollen clouds 
blew through them all. 

Still, some parts of their range 
were more attractive than others. 
The mesa where the Persons of the 
Big Sun had built their shining 
shells and lit their blazing lamps 
had been one of their favorites, pol- 
len drifting down off the hills in a 
pleasant stream and few ha’ aye’ i. 
Charlie sang sorrowfully of his re- 
gret as he thought of it, now that 
they must avoid it for all time to 
come. The bay of the ocean-lake 
where ’Anny ’Alehouse lived was, 
on the contrary, usually to be 
avoided. The water evaporating 
from the sea meant columns of ris- 
ing cloud, and killer balloons no 
doubt in half of the columns. If any 
member of the swarm had chosen to 
question Charlie’s decision to return 
there, it would have been quite 
reasonable to do so, in practical 
terms. But in terms of the lives of 
the balloonists themselves, it was 
quite impossible. Their group deci- 
sions were never questioned. If a 
senior adult sang Do thus, it was 
done. Charlie was the most senior 
of adults, and so his song usually 
prevailed. Not always. Now and 
then another adult would sing a con- 
trary proposal ten minutes later, but 
if Charlie returned to his own ten 
minutes after that, there was no 
complaint. Each of the other adults 
loyally picked up his song, and the 
swarm complied. 

There was also the consideration 
that Charlie had brought to the 
swarm his Friend of the Middle 
Sun, with his astonishing and fas- 
cinating new sounds. This was a 
Person! Puzzling, yes. But not like 



JEM 



81 




those earthbound grubbers of the 
Little Sun or the strange creatures 
of the Big Sun who flew only with 
the help of killing machines. As the 
swarm drew near the camp of the 
Middle Sun, all of the adults rotated 
their bodies so that their tiny faces, 
like the features of engorged ticks, 
looked downward, anxious to spy 
'Anny or ’Appy. Even the bal- 
Ioonets were caught up in the happy 
fever of the search; and when the 
first of the swarm spotted Danny 
rising to meet them, the song of the 
flock became triumphant. 

How strange ’Anny ’Alehouse 
looked this time! His lifting sac had 
always been disagreeably knobby 
and lacking in any decent colora- 
tion, but now it was swollen im- 
mensely and knobbier than ever. 
Charlie might not have recognized 
him, if there had been more than 
one other like him in all the world 
to confuse him with. But it was 
’Anny all the same. The swarm 
swallowed hydrogen and dropped to 
meet him, singing the song of wel- 
come Charlie had invented for his 
friend. 

* ★ * 

Dalehouse was almost as over- 
joyed to see the swarm again as the 
swarm was to see Danny 
Dalehouse. It had been a long time! 
After the storm there had been the 
time for cleaning up; and before 
they were through, the second ship 
had dropped out of the tachyon- 
charge state to bring them new 
people and a whole host of new 
equipment. That was Fine enough, 
but to make them welcome and to 
integrate the new things into the old 
had taken time. More than time. 



Some of what they had brought had 
been gifts for the balloonists, and to 
deliver the gifts meant more load 
had to be lifted, which meant a big- 
ger cluster of balloons, which meant 
making and filling new ones and 
redesigning the ballasting system to 
compensate. Danny was far from 
sure it had been worth it. 

But there had also been half a 
kilo of microfiches from the 
Double-A-L, and those had been 
worth a lot. Professor D. Dalehouse 
was now a name to conjure with 
among xenobiologists. They had 
quoted his reports in every paper. 
And the papers themselves had 
given much to think of. Among the 
conferees at Michigan State a battle 
had raged. In the evolution of the 
balloonists, where was Darwin? 
When a female scattered her 
filamentary eggs into the air of 
Klong like the burst of a milkweed 
pod, and all the males spewed 
sperm at once, where was the selec- 
tion of the fittest? What kind of 
premium on strength, agility, in- 
telligence or sexual attraction would 
make each generation somehow in- 
finitesimally more “fit” than the 
one before in an ontogeny where all 
the males spurted all their genes 
into a cloud of mixed female ge- 
netic material, with the wind for a 
mixer and random chance deciding 
who fathered which on whom? The 
balloonists kept no Leporello lists. 
Well, any one of them might have 
fathered a milk-tre; but if so, he 
never knew it. 

Charlie could have settled the de- 
bate if asked. All the balloonists 
were sexually mature as soon as 
they were able to drop their spider- 
silk parachute threads and float free. 



82 



GALAXY 




But all balloonists were not equal in 
size. 

The older, the bigger. The big- 
ger, the more sperm or eggs they 
flung into the collective pool. 
Human beings, by contrast, cease to 
play a part in evolution before half 
their lives are over. Wisdom does 
not come at twenty-five. By the 
time there is a significant difference 
between a Da Vinci and a dolt, the 
days of breeding are over. Selection 
plays no further part. Nor does it in 
resistance to the degenerative dis- 
eases of the old, which is why in 
two million years the human race 
has not selected against cancer, ar- 
thritis or arteriosclerosis. Raunchy 
young cells have been disciplined 
by the stresses of fifty thousand 
generations. But past the breeding 
age the cell runs out of program- 
ming. It doesn’t know what to do 
next. It begins to fall apart. 

With the balloonists it was differ- 
ent. The Charlie-sized giants among 
them sprayed half a liter of mist- 
of-sperm into each receptive cloud 
of eggs, while the tiny first-swarm 
male balloonets squeezed out hardly 
a drop. The Charlies had proved 
their fitness to survive by the most 
conclusive of tests: they had sur- 
vived. 

Dalehouse was eager to try to set- 
tle questions like that as he called to 
Charlie and swung in to meet him, 
even more eager to try the new lan- 
guage elements the big computers 
on Earth had generated for him. 
What was occupying most of his at- 
tention, though, was his gift from 
Earth. Like the swarm’s greeting 
song, it was an example of the 
thing his society did best. It was a 
weapon. 



It was not entirely a free gift, 
Dalehouse reflected, but then there 
is nothing without a price. Charlie's 
song cost him some of his reserve 
of lifting gas, as the songs that were 
their life always cost the swarm. If 
they sang, they vented gas. If they 
vented gas, they lost lift. If they 
lost lift, sooner or later they drifted 
helplessly down to the eager mouths 
on the surface to be eaten. Or, al- 
most as bad, to live on there, help- 
less and voiceless, until they were 
able to accumulate and dissociate 
enough water molecules to recharge 
their stocks — quickly, if Kung were 
kind enough to flare for them; pain- 
fully slowly otherwise. It was a 
price they paid gladly. To live was 
to sing; to be quiet was to be dead 
anyway. But it was, at the end, for 
most of them, the price of their 
lives. 

The price of the gift Danny 
Dalehouse brought was the lives of 
the five balloonists that had been 
sent back to Earth in the return cap- 
sule. 

The designers at Fort Detrick had 
made good use of the samples. The 
two that were dead on arrival were 
dissected at once. Those were the 
lucky ones. The other three were 
studied in vivo. The biggest and 
strongest of them lasted two weeks. 

The Fort Detrick experimenters 
also had a price to pay, because 
eight of them came down with the 
Klongan hives, and one had the se- 
vere misfortune to have his skull fill 
up with antigenic fluid, so that he 
would never again in the rest of his 
life stress an experimental subject. 
Or, indeed, hold a fork by himself. 
But probably the balloonists who 
had been his subjects would not 



JEM 



83 




have thought that price unfair. 

Danny Dalehouse unslung the 
lightweight carbine from one shoul- 
der and practiced aiming it. Its 
stock was metal shell, and sintered 
metal at that: it weighed hardly a 
kilogram, but half that weight was 
in high-velocity bullets. It was poor 
design. He felt sure the recoil 
would kick him halfway across the 
sky if he fired it. and anyway what 
was "the use of high-velocity bullets? 
What target was there in the Klon- 
gan air that needed that sort of im- 
pact to destroy? But the word from 
Earth brought by the reinforcement 
party that had been labeled a U.N. 
peacekeeping committee was that it 
must be carried. So he carried it. 

He put it back and, somewhat 
uncomfortably, took Charlie's gift 
off the other shoulder. Now, that 
was more like it. Somebody some- 
where had understood what Char- 
lie's people could do, and what they 
needed in order to protect them- 
selves against predators. It weighed 
even less than the carbine, and it 
contained no propellants at all. Its 
tiny winch could be operated by the 
claws of a Charlie to tighten a 
long-lasting elastic cord. Its trigger 
was sized to fit a balloonist, and 
what it fired was a cluster of minute 
needles or, alternatively, a capsule 
of some sort of fluid. Needles were 
for airborne predators. The fluid, or 
so Danny was told, was against cre- 
atures like the crabrats, if a bal- 
loonist was forced down and needed 
defense; and it would only incapaci- 
tate them without killing. 

It would tax all of Dalehouse ’s 
linguistics to convey any part of 
that to Charlie, but the way to get it 
done was to begin. He held the 



crossbow up and sang, carefully at- 
tending to the notes he had been 
taught by the computers at Texas 
A&M: “I have brought you a gift.” 

Charlie responded with a burst of 
song. Dalehouse could understand 
no more than a few phrases, but 
clearly it was a message of gratitude 
and polite inquiry; and anyway, the 
little tape recorder at his belt was 
getting it all down for later study. 
Danny moved on to the next sen- 
tence he had been taught: “You 
must come with me to find a 
ha’ aye' i.” That was hard to sing; 
English does not come with glottal 
stops, and practicing it for an hour 
had left Dalehouse 's throat sore. 
But Charlie seemed to understand, 
because the song of thanks changed 
to a thin melody of concern. Danny 
laughed. “Do not fear," he sang. 
“I will be a ha’ aye’ i to the 
ha’ aye’ i. We will destroy them with 
this gift, and the swarm will no 
more need to fear. 

Song of confusion, with the 
words “the swarm” repeated over 
and over, not only by Charlie but 
by all his flock. 

The hardest part of all was yet to 
come: “You must leave the 

swarm,” sang Dalehouse. “They 
will be safe. We will return. But 
now just you and I must fly to seek 
a ha’ aye’ i. ” 

It took time; but the message ul- 
timately seemed to get across. It 
was a measure of the balloonist’s 
trust in his friend from Earth that he 
was willing to embark on so fearful 
an adventure with him. The mem- 
bers of the flock never left it by 
choice. For more than an hour after 
they dropped to a lower level and 
left the flock behind, Charlie’s song 



84 



GALAXY 




was querulous and sad. And no 
ha’ aye’ i appeared. They left the 
Food Bloc camp far behind, drifting 
down the shore of the sea-lake, and 
then across a neck of it to the vicin- 
ity of the Peeps’ tattered colony. 
For some time Dalehouse had been 
wondering if the Texas computers 
had in fact really given him the 
right words to sing. But then Char- 
lie’s song turned to active fear. 
They dipped low under a bank of 
clouds, warm-weather cumulus that 
looked like female balloonists 
turned upside down, and from one 
of them dropped the predatory form 
of a killer. 

Danny was uneasily tempted to 
slay this first one with his own car- 
bine. It was frightening to see the 
ha’ aye’ i swoop toward them. But he 
wanted to demonstrate his gift to 
Charlie. 

“Watch!” he cried, clumsily 
grasping the grip that had been de- 
signed for balloonist claws. He cir- 
cled the swelling form of the air- 
shark in the cross-haired sight, de- 
signed for balloonist eye-patches, 
feeling the low vibrations of Char- 
lie’s muttered song of terror. At 
twenty meters he squeezed the trig- 
ger. 

A dozen tiny metal spikes lashed 
out at the ha’ aye' i, spreading like 
the cone of fire of a shotgun shell. 
One was enough. The shark’s bag 
ripped open with a puff of moisture. 
The creature screamed once in pain 
and surprise, and then had no more 
breath to scream with. It dropped 
past them, its horrid little face 
writhing, its claws clutching 
uselessly toward them, meters 
away. 

A bright trill of surprise from 



Charlie, and then a roaring paean of 
triumph. “This is a great good 
thing, ’Anny 'Alehouse! Will you 
slay all the ha' aye' i for us?” 

“No, not I, Charlie. You will do 
it for yourself!” And hanging in the 
air, Danny showed him the clever 
little crank that worked the elastic 
cord, the simple breech that the 
cluster of needles dropped into. For 
a creature who had never used tools 
before, Charlie was quick to grasp 
the operation. Dalehouse had him 
fire a practice round at a cloud, and 
then watched patiently while the 
balloonist painfully wound the 
winch for himself and loaded again. 

They were no longer quite alone. 
Unbidden, the swarm had drifted 
after them and were floating half a 
kilometer away, all their eyepalches 
rotated toward them, their distant 
song sweet and plaintive, like a 
puppy’s lonely begging to be let in. 
And down below the Peeps’ camp 
was near, and Dalehouse could see 
one or two upturned faces curiously 
staring at them. Let them look, he 
thought virtuously; let them see how 
the Food Exporting Powers were 
helping the native races of Klong, if 
they had so little to do with their 
time. There were only a handful of 
them left of the original expedition, 
and their much-boasted reinforce- 
ments showed no signs of arriving. 

Reinforcements. Reminded, 
Dalehouse began the rest of his 
message for Charlie. “This gift,” 
he sang, “is yours. But we would 
ask a gift of you, too.” 

“What gift?” sang Charlie po- 
litely. 

“I do not know words,” sang 
Danny, “but soon I will show you. 
My swarm-mates ask you to carry 

85 



JEM 




some small things to other places. 
Some you will drop to the ground. 
Some you will bring back.” Teach- 
ing Charlie how to point the 
cameras and sound-recording in- 
struments was going to take forever, 
Dalehouse thought glumly; and how 
were they ever going to tell him 
where to drop the clusters of 
wolftrap sensors and seismic mikes? 
What seemed so simple on Earth 
was something else entirely on 
Klong — 

“Beware, beware!” sang the dis- 
tant, frantic voices of the swarm. 

Tardily Danny looked around. 
The ha’ aye' i ' s rush caught them 
unaware. It came from behind and 
below, where Dalehouse had not 
thought to look. And Charlie, fon- 
dling his new toy and trying to un- 
derstand what Dalehouse wanted of 
him, had been careless. 

If it had not been for the distant 
shrieking of the swarm, the creature 
might have had them both. But 
Charlie spun faster than Dalehouse, 
and before Danny could unlimber 
his carbine, the balloonist had shown 
how well he had learned his lesson 
by killing the killer. Either of them 
could have reached out and caught 
the long, wicked claws of the 
ha’ aye’ i as it fell past them; it was 
that close. 

“Well done!” yelled Dalehouse, 
and Charlie pealed in rapture: 

“Well, well done! How great a 
gift!” They rose to rejoin the 
swarm — 

Lances of golden fire reached up 
faintly toward the flock from the 
Peeps’ camp below. 

“My God!” shouted Danny. 
“The fools are setting off 
fireworks!” 



The rockets exploded into show- 
ers of sparks, and all through the 
swarm balloonists were bursting 
into bright hydrogen flame.

When Dulla was awake, which 
was not much of the time, he was 
only blurrily conscious of what was 
going on. At first there had been a 
recurrent whack, whack which he 
could not identify, and some person 
who seemed vaguely familiar man- 
handling him into whatever it was 
that was making the sounds. Then 
pain. A lot of pain. Then long 
periods when people were talking to 
him, or around him. But he felt no 
impulse to answer. In his brief con- 
scious times he, by and by, discov- 
ered he was no longer in pain. The 
treatment the Greasies had given 
him had been unpleasant, but it 
seemed to have done the trick. He 
was alive. He was rehydrated. The 
swellings had gone down. He was 
no longer blind. He was only very 
weak. 

When he woke up and realized 
that he was not only awake but ac- 
tually seemed able to keep his eyes 
open for a while, Feng Hua-tze was 
standing by his cot. The Chinaman 
was looking very stretched out, 
Dulla thought with some contempt; 
he looked even worse than Dulla 
himself felt. 

“You are feeling better?” Feng 
asked sadly. 

Dulla thought it over. “Yes. I 
think so. What has happened?” 

“I am glad you are feeling better. 
The long-noses brought you here 
from the place of your beetle 
friends. They said you would live.

but I didn’t think so. It has been a 
tong time. Do you want to eat?” 
‘‘Yes — no,” Dulla corrected 

himself, ‘‘I do, but not at this mo- 
ment. I want the w.c. first.” 

‘‘Shall I help you?” 

“No. I can do it myself.” 

“I am glad of that, too,” said 
Feng, who had been functioning as 
bedpan orderly for all the days of 
Ahmed Dulla’s recovery, and for 
time before that longer than he 
cared to remember. The Pakistani 
raised himself painfully from the in- 
flatable cot and moved slowly to- 
ward the slit-trench latrine. 

He gazed disapprovingly around 
the camp. One of the noises he had 
been hearing identified itself for 
him, a slapping, rasping sound that 
turned out to be the water wheel. 
So at least there should be power. 
But where were the promised flood- 
lights, the growing crops, the com- 
forts? Where were all the people? 

Feng had followed him and stood 
gazing mournfully as Dulla relieved 
himself. “Why do you stand 
there?” snapped Dulla, tying up his 
pajama cord and making hard work 
of it. “What has happened? Why 
has so little been done?” 

The leader spread his hands. 
“What can I say? There were ten of 
us. Two died with you, in this ven- 
ture you found so necessary. One 
other died here. Two were so ill 
they had to be returned to Earth — 
by courtesy of the Greasies. We had 
no one well enough to fly the return 
capsule. The Italian is asleep, and 
the two women are gathering fuel.” 
“Gathering fuel! Are we become 
peasants again, Feng?” 

The leader sighed. “I have done 
my best,” he said; it was a sentence 



he had been saying over and over to 
himself, for a long time. “Help is 
coming. Heir-of-Mao himself has 
ordered it, two great ships, material 
and persons, soon — ” 

“Soon! And until then, what? Do 
we do nothing?” 

“Go back to bed,” said Feng 
wearily. “You exhaust me, Dulla. 
Eat if you will. There is food. The 
Fats gave it to us, otherwise there 
would be none.” 

“And now we are beggars,” 
sneered Dulla. He swayed and 
caught hold of Feng’s shoulder. 
“For this I studied and came all 
these light-years! For this I almost 
died! How foolish we will all look 
when we return in disgrace to 
Earth!” 

Feng shook his head heavily. He 
disengaged the Pakistani’s hand 
from his shoulder and stepped 
downwind — the man was odorously 
unwashed. He did not need to hear 
any of this. He knew it for himself. 
He had accepted the charity of the 
Fats for the food without which 
they all would have starved; of the 
Greasies for the rescue of Dulla and 
for the return to Earth of the sick 
members of the expedition — who 
would no doubt even now be telling 
their debriefers how badly Feng 
Hua-tze had managed the expedition 
with which he had been entrusted. 
There would be large-character 
posters going up in K’ushiu about 
that even now. They would be very 
critical of him. When they got back 
to Earth — if they got back — the best 
hope he had was to become a 
barefoot biochemist again along the 
Yellow River. 

Of course, if somehow they mer- 
cifully spared him until the two 



88 



GALAXY 




great ships arrived — 

Ah, then! He had pored over the 
tachtran messages and pictures 
yearningly. The second ship would 
bring not ten, not Fifteen but a 
majestic thirty-four new persons. 
An agronomist! Someone to take up 
Feng’s own pitiful beginnings, the 
mushrooms he had sown, the wheat 
seedlings he had coaxed to 
sprout — the fittest of them would 
survive, and the fittest of their de- 
scendants would flourish. There 
were two more translators, both 
split-brained, one of them a skilled 
littoral pisciculturist as well. The 
Great Water might yet yield food 
they could eat. A doctor — no, Feng 
corrected himself, a fully schooled 
surgeon, with a world reputation in 
the treatment of traumatic injuries. 
True, he was nearly two meters tall 
and black as a boy-child’s hair, by 
his photograph. But still. Three of 
the new additions had limnology 
crash courses, and one of them, 
who had once been an officer in the 
Red Guards, had also had three 
years of experience as a scout in the 
Gobi, and later in the Himalayas. 

And the worldly goods the other 
ship would carry! Photovoltaic 
generators, capable of pouring out 
230- volt A.C. in really significant 
quantities. Plastic to spare. Pioneer- 
ing tools — axes and machetes, and a 
few rifles for the collection of 
specimens, as well as for “game.” 
Folbots. Magnesium-frame bicycles. 
A doubly redundant computer with 
no fewer than six remote-access 
terminals. Radio equipment. Laser 
equipment. Food. More food; food 
enough for all of them, for many 
months — 

It seemed a dream! 



But what was not a dream was 
that very surely, Feng knew, among 
those thirty-four persons would be 
one who would come over to him 
and quietly say, “Feng Hua-tse? I 
am directed by Heir of-Mao to re- 
ceive your report on why your cus- 
todianship of this project has not 
lived up to expectations.” And then 
would come the sweating time. 
There would be no excuses ac- 
cepted. He would not be interested 
in the mushrooms that were refusing 
to grow, or the specimens that Feng 
himself had painfully kept alive. He 
would only be interested in why 
three had died, and two had been 
sent home, and ten had accom- 
plished so very little. 

All this was in Feng Hua-tze’s 
mind, but all he said was, “Go 
back to sleep, Dulla, I am out of 
patience with you.” 

* * * 

Dulla did not go back to sleep. 
Anger had given him strength. 
What he did was wake up the Ital- 
ian. “Oh, you are alive again?” 
Spadetti yawned and rubbed the 
blue-black stubble on his chin. “We 
thought you were going to die," he 
said cheerfully. “I almost bet a 
day’s ration on it. I would have 
been very angry to lose.” 

“I have been talking to Feng, 
that bungler!” 

“It is not all Uazzi’s fault, Dulla. 
We were the first. We made the 
mistakes that must be made so 
others can learn. ” 

“I did not want to be teacher to 
the Fats and the Greasies! I did not 
want them here at all. This can be 
our planet, to shape as we will!” 
“Yes,” admitted Spadetti, “I 

89 



JEM 




had some such thought myself. But, 
chi sa, what can you do? Each step 
seemed right at the time. Even 
yours, to make friends with the 
natives — ” 

“Those beasts! One cannot make 
friends with them.” 

“Oh, not true, Dulla. Our rivals 
have succeeded. The Fats have bal- 
loonists carrying their cameras all 
over the planet, or so they promise 
on the tachtran. The Greasies are 
teaching their moles and earth- 
worms how to burrow under our 
camp and listen to what we say. 
Perhaps they are listening now.” 

"Nonsense! How stupid you 
are!” 

“Stupid, perhaps, but no, it is 
not entirely nonsense,” smiled the 
Italian, unoffended. “Perhaps I 
have made it a little bit of a joke, 
but I am not sure that I am joking. 
And what have we accomplished? I 
will be more exact, Dulla. What did 
you yourself accomplish, except to 
get two people killed, when you 
visited our frutti-del-mare friends? 
We failed. It is as simple as that.” 
He yawned and scratched. “Now, 
Dulla, per favore. let me wake up 
by myself a little? I am not so 
happy with this reality around me 
that I want to leave my dreams so 
rudely. ” 

“Drink your wine and dream 
then,” said Dulla coldly. 

“Oh, Dulla! But that is not a bad 
idea. If one only had a true wine 
instead of this filth. ” 

"Pig,” said Dulla, but softly 
enough so that Spadetti did not have 
to admit that he had heard it. He re- 
turned to his cot and sat heavily on 
the edge of it, ignoring Spadetti ’s 
soft-voiced imprecations as he 



tasted the jungle juice he had made 
for himself. Perhaps it would kill 
him. Why not? The smell of it kept 
Dulla from wanting to eat, though 
he knew he should; he judged he 
had lost ten kilos at least since land- 
ing on Son of Kung, and he could 
not spare very many more. He sat 
breathing heavily, sucking through a 
straw at a flask of flat, tepid water 
from the still. By and by he noticed 
that there was a plastic pouch under 
his bed. He upended it, and covered 
the cot with a drift of tiny white 
fiche-prints. 

“I see you have found your 
love-letters.” called the Italian from 
across the tent. “Unfortunately, I 
cannot read your language. But she 
is quite a pretty girl. ” 

Dulla ignored him. He gathered 
them up and carried them to the 
radio shack, where the only work- 
ing viewer was. Spadetti had been 
right; they were almost all from the 
Bulgarian girl, and they all said 
much the same thing. She missed 
him. She thought of him. She con- 
soled her lonely sorrow with the 
memory of their days together in 
Sofia. 

But in the photographs there was 
Ana in Paris, Ana in London, Ana 
in Cairo, Ana in New York. She 
seemed to be having an interesting 
time without him. 

Rich countries! At bottom, were 
they not all the same, whether the 
wealth was in fuel or in food? 
Wealth was wealth! A greater dis- 
tance separated him from the fat 
Bulgarians than from — from even 
the Krinpit, he thought, and then 
realized almost at once that he was 
being unjust. Nan was not like that. 
But then she had had the advantage 



90 



GALAXY 




of spending much of her childhood 
in Hyderabad. 

Away from the smell of the Ital- 
ian’s imitation wine, Dulla realized 
he was hungry. He found some 
cracked com and ate it while he 
went through Ana’s letters quickly, 
and then, more slowly, the synop- 
tics from Earth. Much had hap- 
pened while he was out of it. The 
Fats had been reinforced from 
Earth — it was called a U.N. 
peacekeeping team, but that de- 
ceived only the most naive. The 
Greasies had established a satellite 
astronomical observatory and were 
monitoring changes in the radiation 
of Kung. There were problems with 
the satellite, and the results were 
unclear. Even so, Dulla studied the 
reports with fascination and envy. 
That should have been his own pro- 
ject! It was what he had trained for, 
all those graduate years. What a 
waste this expedition was! He 
glanced distastefully at the gaping 
rents in the tent, at the instruments 
that were scattered out to rust be- 
cause there was no one to use them. 
So much to be done. So much that 
he could not think where to begin, 
and so could do nothing. 

There was a racket outside which 
made Dulla glance up, frowning. 
Feng and the Italian, quarreling 
about something, and behind them 
the distant squawking of a herd of 
balloonists. If Heir-of-Mao had 
been a little more openhanded, and 
if Feng had been a bit less of a 
fool — Then they might have had a 
helicopter, like the Greasies, or the 
wit to make balloons, like the Fats, 
and he too might have had the 
chance to fly with the flocks. That 
chance was lost. Even the Krinpit, 

JEM 



whom he himself, Ahmed Dulla, 
had resolved to make contact with, 
were as strange to him as ever. It 
was not fair! He had taken the risk. 
He remembered well how he had 
felt as he lay helpless among the 
curious jostling masses of crablike 
creatures. If they hadn’t tried to eat 
the other two first, he knew he 
would have wound up a meal. And 
for nothing. The one Krinpit they 
had a chance to communicate with, 
to keep for a specimen, Feng had 
allowed to be stolen by the 
Greasies. 

There were sudden new sounds 
from outside, hissing white sounds 
that made Dulla get up and peer out 
of the tent. He saw flames reaching 
toward the sky, and Feng struggling 
with the Italian, while one of the 
Jamaican women swore angrily at 
them both. “What is happening 
here?” Dulla demanded. 

The Italian pushed Feng away 
and turned toward Dulla, his ex- 
pression repentant. “Uazzi wished 
to greet our friends,” he said, peer- 
ing aloft. The rockets had climbed 
up into the maroon murk and 
exploded, and there were smaller 
explosions all around them: bal- 
loonists had caught fire from the 
shower of sparks. “I helped him 
aim, but perhaps— perhaps my aim 
was not good,” he said. 

“Foolish one!” cried Dulla, al- 
most dancing with rage, “Do you 
see what you have done?” 

“I have burned up a few gas- 
bags, why not?” grumbled Spadetti. 

“Not just gasbags! Rub the wine 
out of your eyes and look again, 
there! Is that a gasbag? Do you not 
see it is a human being hanging 
there, wondering why we have tried 

91 




to kill him, anxious to return to his 
base with the Fats or the Greasies 
and report that the People’s Repub- 
lics have declared war? Another 
blunder! And one we may not sur- 
vive. ” 

“Peace, Dulla,” panted Feng. 
“It does not matter if the Fats and 
the Greasies are angry at us now. 
Help is on the way. ” 

“You are as big a fool as he! 
Shooting off fireworks like some 
farm brigade celebrating the over- 
fulfillment of its cabbage quota!” 

“I wish,” said Feng, “that you 
had not been rescued, Dulla. There 
was less struggle here when you 
were with Krinpit.” 

“And I wish,” said Dulla, “that 
the Krinpit who tried to kill me was 
our leader here instead of you. He 
was less ugly, and less of a fool.” 

* * * 

That Krinpit was many kilometers 
away, and at that moment almost as 
angry as Dulla. He had been driven 
almost to the point of insanity, with 
the infuriating attempts of the 
Poison Ghosts of the Fuel camp to 
converse with him, with hunger and 
above all with the continual blind- 
ing uproar of the camp. 

In the noisy bright world of the 
Krinpit there was never a time of si- 
lence. But the level of sound was 
always manageable: sixty or seventy 
decibels most of the time, except 
for the occasional thunderclap of a 
storm. It almost never reached over 
seventy-five. 

To Sham-igon, the Fuel camp 
was torture. Sometimes it was quiet 
and dim, sometimes blindingly 
loud. The Krinpit had no internal 
combustion engines to punish their 



auditory nerves. The Greasies had 
dozens of them. Sham-igon had no 
conception of how they worked or 
what they were for, but he could 
recognize each of them when it was 
operating: high clatter of the drilling 
machine, rubbery roar of the 
helicopter, rattle and whine of the 
power saws, steady chug of the 
water pump. He had arrived at the 
camp almost blind, for the nearness 
of the helicopter’s turbojet had af- 
fected his hearing just as staring at 
the uncaged sun would damage a 
human’s eyes; the afterimage lasted 
for days, and was still maddeningly 
distorting to his perceptions. He had 
been penned within steel bars as 
soon as he arrived. However hard 
he gnawed and sawed, the bars of 
the cage would not give. As soon as 
he made a little scratch in one, it 
was replaced. The Poison Ghosts 
troubled him endlessly, echoing his 
name and his sounds in a weirdly 
frightening way. Sham-igon knew 
nothing of tape recording, and to 
hear his own sounds played back to 
him was as shattering an experience 
as it would be for a human to see 
his own form suddenly appear be- 
fore him. He had realized th&t the 
Poison Ghosts wanted to communi- 
cate with him, and had understood a 
tiny portion of what they were try- 
ing to say. But he seldom replied. 
He had nothing to say to them. 

And he was nearly starving. He 
survived, barely, on what little he 
would eat of what they put before 
him — mostly vegetation, of which 
he disdained the majority as a 
human being would spurn thistle 
and grass. His hunger was madden- 
ingly stimulated because he could 
smell the tasty nearness of Ghosts 



92 



GALAXY 




Below penned near him, and even a 
Ghost Above now and then. But the 
Poison Ghosts never brought him 
any of these to eat. And always 
there was the blinding roar of noise, 
of the equally unpleasant silences 
when the camp slept and only the 
laint eeho from tents and soft 
bodies kept him company. Human 
beings, scantily fed on bread and 
water in an isolation cell, with 
bright lights denying them sleep, go 
mad. Sham-igon was not far from 
it. 

But he clung to sanity, because 
he had a goal. The Poison Ghosts 
had killed Cheee-pruitt. 

He had not learned to tell one 
from another in time to know which 
was the culprit, but that was a prob- 
lem easily solved. They were all 
guilty. Even in his madness it was 
clear to him that it was proper for 
him to kill a great many of them to 
redress their guilt, but what had not 
become clear to him was how. The 
chitin of claw and shell-sword were 
rubbed flat and sore against the 
bars, and still the bars held. 

When all the sounds were out, he 
chatted with the Ghost Above, 
straining longingly against the bars. 
"1 wish I could eat you,” he said. 
If it had not been for the bars, the 
Ghost Above would have been easy 
prey. It had lost most of its gas and 
was crawling about the floor of a 
cage like his own. Its song was no 
more than a pathetic whisper. 

“You cannot reach me,” it 
pointed out, “unless you moult. 
And then I would eat you.” Each 
spoke in its own language, but over 
thousands of generations all the 
races of Klong knew a little of the 
lunguage of the others. With the 



Ghosts Above you could not help 
being exposed to their constant sing- 
ing, and even the Ghosts Beneath 
could be heard chattering and 
whistling in their tunnels. “1 have 
eaten several of you hardshells,” 
the Ghost Above wheezed faintly. 
“I particularly like the backlings 
and the first moult.” 

The creature was boasting, but 
Sharn-igon could believe the story 
easily enough. The balloonists fed 
mostly on airborne detritus, but to 
make their young healthy they 
needed more potent protein sources 
now and then. When the breeding 
time was on, the females would 
drop like locusts to scour the 
ground clean of everything they 
could find. Adult Krinpit in shell 
were too dangerous, but in moult 
they were fair game. Best of all was 
a clutch of Ghosts Below caught on 
their thieving raids to the surface — 
for Krinpit as well as balloonist. 
The thought made Sharn-igon ’s 
salivary glands flow. 

“Hard-shell,” whispered the 
Ghost Above, “I am dying, I think. 
You can eat me then if you like.” 

In all honesty, Sham-igon was 
forced to admit, “You may be eat- 
ing me before that.” But then he 
perceived that something was 
strange. The Ghost Above was no 
longer in its cage. It was dragging 
slowly across the floor. “How did 
you escape?” he demanded. 

“Perhaps because I am so close 
to death,” sang the Ghost Above 
faintly. “The Killing Ones made a 
hole in my sac to let the life out of 
me, and then closed it with a thing 
that stuck and clung and stung. But 
it has come loose, and almost all 
my life has spilled away, and I was 



JEM 



93 




able to slide between the bars.” 

“1 wish I could slide through the 
bars!” 

“Why do you not open the cage? 
You have hard things. The Killing 
Ones push a hard thing into a place 
in the cage when they want to, and 
it opens.” 

“What hard thing are you speak- 
ing of? I have worn my shell to 
pulp.” 

“No,” sighed the balloonist. 
“Not like your shell. Wait, there is 
one by the door, I will show you.” 

Sharn-igon’s conception of keys 
and locks was quite unlike a hu- 
man’s, but the Krinpit too had ways 
of securing one thing to another 
temporarily. He chattered and 
scratched in feverish impatience 
while the dying gasbag slowly 
dragged itself toward him, with 
something bright and hard in its 
shadowy mouth. 

‘‘Could you push that thing into 
the place in my cage?” he whee- 
dled. 

The Ghost Above sang softly to 
itself for a moment. Then it pointed 
out, “You will eat me.” 

“Yes, I will. But you are very 
close to dying anyway,” Sham-igon 
pointed out; and added shrewdly, 
“You sing very badly now.” 

The balloonist hissed sadly with- 
out forming words. It was true. 

“If you push the hard thing in 
the place in my cage so that I can 
go free,” bargained Sham-igon, “I 
will kill some of the Poison Ghosts 
for you.” He added honestly, “1 in- 
tend to do that in any case, since 
they killed my he- wife.” 

“How many?” whispered the 
balloonist doubtfully. 

“As many as I can,” said 



Sharn-igon. “At least one. No. 
Two. Two for you, and as many as 
I can for me.” 

“Three for me. The three who 
come to this place and cause me 
pain.” 

“All right, yes, three,” cried 
Sham-igon. “Anything you like! 
But do it quickly if you are going to 
do it, before the Poison Ghosts 
come back!” 

* * * 

Hours later, at almost the last of 
his strength, Sharn-igon staggered 
into a Krinpit village. It was not his 
own. He had seen the sounds of it 
on the horizon for a long time, but 
he was so weak and filled with pain 
that it had taken him longer to 
crawl the distance than the tiniest 
backling. “Sham-igon, Sham-igon, 
Sham-igon,” he called, as he ap- 
proached the alien Krinpit. “I am 
not of your place. Sham-igon. 
Sham-igon!” 

A gravid female scuttled past 
him. She moved slowly, because 
she was near her time, but she ig- 
nored his presence. 

That did not surprise Sham-igon. 
It was what he had expected. In- 
deed, each lurching step into the 
alien village was harder for him 
than the one before, and he was a 
professional empathizer. ‘ ‘Sham- 
igon,” he called bravely. “I would 
speak to one among you, although I 
am not of this place. ” 

There was no answer, of course 
It would not be easy to make con 
tact. Each village was culturally, as 
well as geographically, isolated 
from every other. They did not 
fight. But they did interact. If a 
party of Krinpit from one village 



94 



GALAXY 




chanced upon an individual or a 
party from another, they deper- 
sonalized each other. One Krinpit 
might push one from another village 
out of the way. Two alien Krinpit 
might each take an end of a 
Many-Tree trunk that was barring 
their collective way. Both would 
lift. Neither would address the 
other. 

Genetically the villages were not 
isolated. The seedlings dropped 
from their he-father’s backs when 
they were ripe to do so, wherever 
they might be. If they chanced to be 
near an alien village when they 
did — and if they were lucky enough 
to make their way to it without be- 
coming food for a Ghost Below or 
any other marauder — they were ac- 
cepted there as readily as any au- 
tochthone. But adults never did 
such a thing. 

On the other hand, adults never 
found themselves in Sham-igon’s 
position, until now. 

“Sham-igon, Sharn-igon.” he 
called, over and over, and at last a 
he-mother crept toward him. It did 
not speak directly to him, but it did 
not retreat, either. As it moved, it 
softly made the sound of its name: 
Tsharr-p’fleng. 

“Have you had a good Ring 
Greeting, alien brother?” Sham- 
igon asked politely. 

No answer, except that the sound 
of the stranger’s name grew a trifle 
louder and more assured. 

“1 am not of this place,” Sharn- 
igon acknowledged. “It is most un- 
pleasant for me to be here, and I 
am aware it is unpleasant also for 
you. However, I must speak with 
you.” 

Agitatedly the other Krinpit 



scratched and thumped its name for 
a moment, and then managed to 
speak. “Why arc you here, Sham- 
igon?” 

He collapsed on the knees of his 
forelegs. “I must have food.” he 
said. The balloonist had been so 
very thin and frail, he had made 
only half a meal, and of course 
Sham-igon had been careful not to 
eat any part of the Poison Ghosts. 
He was not sure he had succeeded 
in killing all three, but two at least 
were certain and the other would be 
a long time recovering. That settled 
the score for the balloonist. 

But not for Cheee-pruitt. 

* * * 

If Sham-igon had not been a pro- 
fessional empathist he could not 
have broken through the barriers be- 
tween villages. Even so, it took 
much time and all of his persuasion; 
but at the end of it Tsharr-p’fleng 
helped him to a dwelling-pen and 
ministered to his needs. 

Sham-igon devoured the crab-rat 
they brought him, while Tsharr- 
p’fleng engaged in agitated conver- 
sation with others of the village just 
outside the wall. Then they came in 
and ranged themselves around 
Sham-igon, listening to him eat. He 
ignored their polite scratches of 
curiosity and concern until every 
morsel was gone. Then he pushed 
away the splintered carapace and 
spoke. 

“The Poison Ghosts killed my 
he- wife, and did not eat him, ” 

A flickering sound of disgust. 

“They captured me and held me 
in a place without doors. They re- 
moved my backlings and took them 



JEM 



95 




away. I do not think they were 
eaten, but I have not heard them 
since.” 

Brighter sounds, disgust mixed 
with sympathy and anger. 

"Moreover, they have also cap- 
tured Ghosts Above and Ghosts Be- 
low, and many of the lesser living 
things, and have eaten none of 
them. I therefore killed three of the 
Poison Ghosts. I intend to kill 
more. Are you backmates with the 
Poison Ghosts?” 

The he-mother rustled and spoke 
with contempt. “Not those! Their 
backmates are the Ghosts Below.” 

Another said, “But the Poison 
Ghosts have ways of killing. They 
have spoken to us in our language 
and told us to beware of them, lest 
they kill us. ” 

“Beware of what? What did they 
tell you to do?” 

“Only to refrain from harming 
any of them, for then they will kill 
all our village. ” 

Sham-igon said, “The Poison 
Ghosts do not speak truth. Listen! 
They say they come from another 
world, like the stars in the sky. 
What are these stars?” 

“They say they are like the heat 
from the sky,” muttered the other. 

“I have felt the heat from the 
sky. I have felt no heat from these 
other stars. I hear nothing from 
them. No matter how loud I shout, 

I hear no echo from any of them. ” 

“We have said these things our- 
selves,” said Tsharr-p’fleng slowly. 
“But we are afraid of the Poison 
Ghosts. They will kill us, without 
eating. ” 

“They will, it is true,” said 
Sham-igon. He paused. Then he 
went on: “Unless we kill them first. 



Unless all of our villages together 
fall upon them and kill them, with- 
out eating. ” 

XI 

Marge Menninger’s hair was no 
longer blonde. The name on her 
passport was not Marge Menninger. 
According to her travel orders, she 
was now a major, en route to a new 
duty station; and although the orders 
authorized a delay en route, it was 
unlikely that the general who signed 
them had contemplated that it would 
be spent in Paris. 

In the little room of her hotel she 
fidgeted over the so-called crois- 
sant, and what passed for orange 
juice, and phoned down to the con- 
cierge to see if the message she was 
expecting had arrived. “I regret it, 
Meez Bernardi, but there is noth- 
ing,” sighed the concierge. Marge 
took another bite of the croissant 
and gave it up. France was nomi- 
nally part of the Food Bloc — by the 
skin of its teeth, and by the relabel- 
ing of Algerian wine for export — 
but you couldn’t prove it by what 
they gave you for breakfast. 

She was tired of this room, with 
its leftover smells of khef and sex- 
ual athletics from its previous oc- 
cupants. She wanted to move 
around and couldn’t. And while she 
was fretting away time in this room, 
the Peep ships were going through 
pre-launch, the training of backup 
crews for the next Food Bloc mis- 
sion was limping along without her 
and only God knew what disasters

STELLAR EMPIRES 

- applied for 

Man's wildest whims and 
dreams of far-flung space 
travel come alive in this simu- 
lation of future reality. 6-10 
players each start out knowing 
only the locations of their own 
explored systems, meeting up 
with aliens in space. Each 
home system possesses indus- 
trial capability with enough 
A SPACE COLONIZER resources to construct coloniz- 
ing, commerical and military fleets. Economic capability 
increases with time as colonies are established and 
industrial might spreads across the galaxy. Other players 
are soon contacted, introducing the political intrigue 
and diplomacy that will become crucial factors in main- 
taining the new empire. Each player is in competition 
to emerge victorious with the largest empire. It is up to 
the player to decide whether he will build his empire 
peaceably or at the expense of his neighbors. 

STELLAR EMPIRES is played exclusively through the 
mail. REAL SIMULATIONS GAMES supplies all opponents 
from across the continent and processes each game 
turn. Once every 2-3 weeks, we send each player his 
“turn," consisting of his results from last turn and a 
questionnaire for him to complete detailing his moves 
and decisions for the current turn. For more information,

message at the concierge’s desk, on 
a flimsy blue slip of paper: 

Miss Hester Bemardi will be 

picked up at 1500 hours for her 

appointment. 

It had obviously been there all 
along. Margie did not bother to rep- 
rimand the concierge; tipping time 
would take care of that. She pushed 
her way out into the rue Caumartin, 
deciding what to do next. Six hours 
to kill! And for the life of her she 
could not think of any productive 
use to make of them. 

It was a warm, drizzly day. The 
stink of gasoline drenched the air 
over the Place de l’Opera. Food 
Bloc or not, France was cozy with 
the Ay-rabs, as well as the Peeps. 
That was another reason you could 
not trust the frogs, Margie thought 
darkly. One of her grandfathers had 
marched into this city in Wehnnacht 
gray and the other, in the opposite 
direction a few years later, in 
American olive-drab, and both of 
them had passed on to her their 
feelings about the French. They 
were inconstant allies, and unreli- 
able subjects, and the few who ever 
seemed to have any sense of na- 
tional purpose usually wound up 
having their heads shaved by the 
many who did not. In Margie’s 
view, the French were not a bit bet- 
ter than the English, the Spanish, 
the Italians, the Portuguese, the 
Asians, the Africans, the Latins and 
about ninety per cent, when you 
came right down to it, of the 
Americans too. 

But the immediate problem was 
not what was wrong with humanity 
but what she could do with this 
day. There was only one answer. She 



could do the thing most American 
women came to Paris to do. She 
could shop. 

She not only could shop, she 
must; it was the best way of avoid- 
ing attention. She not only must, 
she wanted to. 

It was one of Margie’s most 
closely guarded secrets that periodi- 
cally she went on shopping binges, 
out of one store and into another, 
pricing fabric, trying on dresses, 
matching shoes with gowns. In her 
little Houston apartment there were 
two closets, plus half of what was 
meant to be a guest room, filled with 
her purchases. They were thrown 
jumbled onto shelves, pushed under 
a bed in their original store bags; 
sweaters she would never wear, 
material half-sewn into drapes that 
would be hung. Her living room 
was spartan and her bedroom was 
always immaculate, because you 
never knew who might drop in. But 
the secret rooms were part of the 
hidden personality of Margie Men- 
ninger. None of what she bought 
was very expensive. It was not be- 
cause she was economical. She had 
unaccounted funds at her disposal, 
and the prices never mattered. But 
her taste was for quantity rather than 
quality. Periodically she would 
wage war against the overflow and 
then for a while Goodwill and the 
Salvation Army would fatten off her 
discards. But a week later the hoard 
would have grown again. 

Margie did not bother with the 
tourist traps along the Champs 
Elysees or the tucked-away bou- 
tiques. Her tastes were for stores 
like Printemps, Uniprix and the 
Galeries Lafayette. The only fly in 
the ointment was that she could

not buy anything. She could not 
carry it where she was going, and 
did not want to attract attention by 
leaving it, so she tried on, and she 
priced, and for six hours she made 
the lives of a score of Parisian 
shopgirls a living hell. That didn’t 
bother Margie Menninger at all. By 
the time the taxicab picked her up 
at her hotel, punctually on the tick 
of three o’clock, her good nature 
was restored. She leaned back 
against the hard plastic seatback of 
the cab, ready for what was to 
come next. 

The driver stopped at the Place 
Vendome long enough for another 
passenger to jump in. Behind his 
tourist shades was the face of her 
father, which was no surprise to 
Margie. “Bonjour, honey,” he 
said. “I brought you your toy.” 

She took the camera he offered 
her and hefted it critically. It was 
heavier than it looked; she would 
have to be careful not to let anyone 
else pick it up. 

"Don’t try to take pictures with 
it,” he said, “because it won’t. Just 
hang it around your neck on the 
strap. Then, when you get where 
you’re going — ” he pushed the shut- 
ter lever, and the casing opened to 
reveal a dull metal object inside — 
“this is what you give your con- 
tact. Along with a hundred thousand 
petrodollars. They’re in the carrying 
case. ” 

“Thank you, Poppa.” 

He twisted in the seat to look at 
her. “You’re not going to tell your 
mother that I let you do this, are 
you?” 

“Christ, no. She’d have a shit 
hemorrhage.” 

“And don’t get caught,” he 
JEM 



added as an afterthought. “Your 
contact was one of Tam Gulsmit’s 
best people, and he is going to 
be really ticked off when he finds 
out we turned him. How are 
things going at Fort Detrick?” 

“Good shape, Poppa. You get 
me the transport. I’ll send some 
good people.” 

He nodded. "We’ve had a little 
lucky break,” he offered. “The 
Peeps fired on one of our guys. No 
harm done, but it makes a nice in- 
cident. ” 

“Didn’t he fire back, for Christ’s 
sake?” 

“Not him! It was your old 
jailhouse buddy, the one from Bul- 
garia. As near as I can tell, he 
doesn’t believe in the use of force. 
Anyway, he did exactly what I 
would have told him to do. He got 
the hell out of there and reported 
back to the U. N. peacekeeping 
force, and he had tapes and pictures 
to prove what he said.” He peered 
out the window. They had crossed 
the Seine. Now they were creeping 
through heavy traffic in a working- 
class neighborhood. “This is where 
I get out. See you in Washington, 
love. And take care of yourself.” 

* * * 

Early the next morning, Margie 
was in Trieste. She was not Hester 
Bernard! any more, but she wasn’t 
Marge Menninger either. She was a 
sleepy Swiss-Italian housewife in a 
sweaty pants suit, driving to the 
Yugoslav border in a rented Fiat 
electrocar with a crowd of other 
Sunday-moming shoppers looking 
for cheap vegetables and bargains in 
Yugoslavian kitchenware. Unlike 

99 




them, she drove straight through to 
Zagreb, parked the car and took a 
bus to the capital. 

When she reached Belgrade, the 
object her father had given her was 
at the bottom of a plastic shopping 
bag, with an old sweater and a 
shabby pocketbook on top of it. 
And she had had very little sleep. 

Margie could not have grown up 
in the household of Godfrey Men- 
ninger without learning the easy 
dialogue of espionage. In all the 
world, she was the only person with 
whom her father had always been 
open. First because she was too lit- 
tle to understand, and so he could 
speak freely in her presence. Then 
because she had to understand. 
When the PLO kidnapped her, she 
had been terrified past the point a 
four-year old can survive, and her 
father’s patient explanations had 
been the only thing that let her 
make sense of the terror. And fi- 
nally, because he trusted her to un- 
derstand, always, that the grotesque 
and lethal things he did had a pur- 
pose. He never questioned that she 
shared that purpose. So she had 
grown up in an atmosphere of drops 
and liquidations and couriers and 
double agents, at the center of a 
web that stretched all around the 
world. 

But now she was not at the center 
of the web, she was not where the 
risks were immense and the penal- 
ties drastic. She walked quickly 
down the busy streets, avoiding 
eye contact. The closet-sized shops 
had their doors open, and confusing 
smells came out of them: a knifelike 
aroma of roasting meat from a 
dressmaker’s (when had she eaten 
last?), the sting of unwashed 



armpits from what seemed to be a 
costume-jewelry boutique. She 
crossed, dodging a tram, and saw 
the office she was looking for. The 
sign said “Electrotek Miinschen,” 
and it was over a sweatshop where 
fat, huge men in T-shirts worked at 
belt-driven sewing machines. 

She checked her watch. There 
was more than an hour before her 
first possible contact. The man she 
needed to meet was a short, slim 
Italian who would be wearing a 
football blazer with the name of the 
Skopje team. Of course, no one like 
that was in sight yet — even if he 
turned up for the first rendezvous, 
which her father had warned was 
unlikely. 

Down the block there was a clus- 
ter of roofed sheds surrounding a 
gabled two-story building that 
looked like any American suburban 
town’s left-over railroad station. A 
farmer’s market? It seemed to be 
something like that. Margie pushed 
her way through crowds of women 
in babushkas and women in mini- 
frocks, men in blue smocks carrying 
crates of pink new potatoes on their 
shoulders and men with a child on 
each hand, studying counters of 
chocolates and jellies. It was a satis- 
fying, busy mob. She was not con- 
spicuous there. 

She was, however, hungry. 

Strawberries seemed to be in sea- 
son. Margie bought half a kilo, and 
a bottle of Pepsi, and found a seat 
on a stone balustrade next to an 
open suitcase full of screwdrivers 
and cast-aluminum socket wrenches. 
What Margie wanted most was a 
hamburger, but no one seemed to 
be selling anything like that. But 
others were eating strawberries, and 



100 



GALAXY 




Margie was confident she looked 
like any of them, or, at least, if not 
like them, like some housewife who 
might have stopped en route to any 
ordinary destination to refresh her- 
self. 

At two, punctually, she was back 
in front of Electrotek Munschen, 
studying a Belgrade bus guide as 
instructed. No short, slim Italian 
appeared. Twice she caught 
snatches of words that seemed to be 
in English, but when she looked up 
from her bus guide and glanced 
casually in that direction, she could 
not tell which of the passersby had 
spoken. She pitched the bus guide 
into a comer sewer and walked an- 
grily away. The second appointment 
was not until ten o’clock, at one of 
the big old luxury hotels, and what 
in God’s name was she going to do 
until then? 

She had to keep moving. It was 
very hard to stroll for more than 
seven hours, however many Cam- 
paris and soda you are willing to 
stop and drink. God bless, she 
passed something that called itself, 
in Cyrillic letters, an Expres- 
Restoran, and when she realized 
that it was a cafeteria, one problem, 
at least, was solved. She pointed at 
something that looked like roast 
chicken, and probably was, and 
with the mashed potatoes and bread 
that went with it, at least she was 
full. Full of time. She emptied her- 
self of as much of it as she could: 
a stroll through the botanical gar- 
dens, a long window-shopping stroll 
down the Boulevard Marshall Tito. 
And then it began to rain. She re- 
treated in to a Bioskop and watched 
a Czech comedy with Serbo- 
Croatian subtitles until nine. The 



only problem was staying awake, 
but when she got to the hotel, there 
was a real problem. Ghelizzi did 
not show up there, either. 

By now she was almost dizzy 
with fatigue, her clothes were 
sweaty and rain-stained and she was 
sure she was beginning to smell. 
Poppa had not really thought these 
arrangements through, she thought 
with some bitterness. It should have 
occurred to him that the waiters at 
the hotel bar would not fail to 
notice a sweaty, dirty foreign 
woman among all their marble and 
their string trios. If she had been a 
man, it might not have mattered. A 
man could have been checking out 
the hotel whores, the skinny dark- 
at-the-roots blonde playing solitaire 
by the fireplace, the plump one with 
the bright red hair who had left the 
aperitif-lounge twice in one hour, 
with different men, and was back 
again, ready for the next. Margie 
refused another Campari, and sent 
the waiter for a Turkish coffee. The 
next appointment was not until the 
following afternoon, and where 
would she sleep? 

The whores had rooms. If she 
had been one of them — 

The idea did not disturb Margie 
in any moral way, but it took only a 
second for her to discard it as im- 
practical. Even if she had a room, 
the waiters would surely throw her 
out to protect the existing monopoly 
the first time she looked toward one 
of the solitary males. They were al- 
ready looking at her with interest, 
and beginning to take the cloths off 
some of the tables in the farther end 
of the room. 

Margie picked up her coffee and 
moved to the table of the streaked 



JEM 



101 




blonde. She spoke to her in Eng- 
lish, confident that in a tourist 
hotel the girls would be fluent in 
the necessary words in any major 
language. “How much for all 
night?" she asked. 

The blonde looked scandalized. 
“For yourself? How disgusting! I 
could not possibly do such a thing 
with a woman. ’’ 

“Fifty dinars. ” 

“One hundred.” 

“All right, one hundred. But I 
have very special tastes, and you 
must do exactly as I ask.” 

The blonde looked skeptical, then 
shrugged and signaled the waiter. 
“First you must buy me a real 
Scotch-whiskey while you explain 
what these tastes are. Then we will 
s' e. ” 

* * * 

In the morning Margie woke up 
refreshed. She used the whore’s tiny 
shower to get clean, dressed quickly 
and paid the woman off with a 
smile. “May I ask a question?” the 
whore offered, counting the money. 
“I can’t stop you from asking.” 
“This thing you had me do, sim- 
ply rubbing your neck each time 
you woke until you fell asleep 
again? Is that truly satisfying to 
you?” 

“You wouldn’t believe how satis- 
fying,” smiled Margie. She strolled 
grandly out of the hotel, nodding 
politely to the local police in their 
baggy gray uniforms open at the 



neck, the hands on the guns in the 
cardboard holsters. A few blocks 
down the boulevard took her to the 
London Cafe, and there, nursing a 
beer at one of the indoor tables, 
was the slim, short Italian wearing a 
Skopje football cap. 

She sat down and ordered a cof- 
fee, then visited the' women’s w.c. 
When she came back, the Italian was 
gone. The bag she had left on her 
chair did not appear to be disturbed, 
but her exploring fingers told her 
the camera was gone, and in its 
place was a guide folder about the 
hovercraft cruise to the Iron Gorge. 

She made her way back across 
the border in the same order. By the 
time she was in Trieste again, and 
able to resume the identity of the 
American tourist, Hester Bemardi, 
she was fully restored. On the clam- 
jet to Paris she locked herself in the 
toilet and studied the contents of the 
travel folder. 

How Ghelizzi had come to be a 
person of trust in Sir Tam’s army of 
spies was beyond her; he had not 
impressed her as being the sort of 
man one would repose faith in. But 
he had delivered the goods this 
time. The little device was on its way, 
and the complete file of secret 
tachtran messages between Earth 
and the Fuel Bloc camp on Klong 
was in her hands in microfiche. Her 
father would be very proud.

I 4 DOUBLEDAY 




Something was rotten in the 
State of Peusa 



The softly curving walls of the 
Temple of God soared upward to 
the sky. No living man or woman 
had ever seen where and how they 
converged in the apex of the vast 
building. There were no windows 
higher than fifty feet, and the 
inward-curving walls above the 
windows rose on into the void — 
first white, then gray, then utter 
black. 

Preacher Peter said: “And I say 
unto you, in the Word of God in 
this Temple of God in the World of 
God, the Sun is most wondrous, the 
Sun of God gives us life, praise the 
Sun of God. ...” 

Fredi was not listening, and this 
in itself was a crime. Not heeding 
the Word of God — unlike the 
thousands of others in the enormous 
Temple, who were listening so in- 
tently that every nuance of Peter’s 
voice reached them — was sinful. 
But it did not bother Fredi, who 
carried in his bosom a crime so 
much greater. 

Fredi was in love with a 
priestess — in fact, with the High 
Priestess herself. More specifically, 
he lusted after the High Priestess; 
and although as an intelligent youth 
he could not believe that such a 
thing had never happened before, it 
was to him as though the first and 
only time, because no one had ever 
dared admit such feelings. 



Preacher Peter said: “Praise the 
Sun, from whom all blessings flow. 
The Sun of God was sent to save us 
from eternal darkness. ...” 

Fredi, conscious of sinning, was 
not certain whether he felt more or 
less guilty inasmuch as until re- 
cently he had been a devout 
worshiper — and had even consid- 
ered trying to become a priest him- 
self. Since so few were called, he 
had become an actor instead. 

Anyway, now all thoughts of be- 
coming a priest were banished. One 
who sinned as he was sinning, even 
if only in his mind, was not worthy. 
His personal integrity lacked the 
sublimity to make him openly con- 
fess his crime; yet it was strong 
enough that he would never be able 
to imagine himself as one of the 
Twelve Apostles. 

Preacher Peter said: “Praise the 
Holy Trinity, the Word of God, the 
Sun of God and the World of 
God. ...” 

It would not be long now, Fredi 
thought, his mind surfacing briefly 
to see and hear how far the preacher 
had progressed. Vaguely he re- 
membered once having heard the 
phrase, “The Father, The Son and 
the Holy Ghost,” but that obviously 
came from a corrupt early form of 
worship, probably devil-worship — 
certainly it was arrant superstition, 
dragging a ghost into it and per- 



WORLD OF GOD 



105 




sonifying God as the Father and the 
Sun as His Son. 

While Fredi’s mind had wan- 
dered, the priest had come to the 
end of the sermon and now ev- 
eryone was chanting softly, Fredi 
included: “Our God which art in 
the sky, hallowed be Thy name, 
Thy World is come. Thy will be 
done in the World as it is in the 
sky. ...” 

And then the twelve priestesses 
emerged through the pillared arch, 
led by the High Priestess Mary, 
Virgin Mother of the Sun. 

Fredi did not even see the eleven 
other priestesses; it was as though 
he had never seen them. He saw 
only Mary. 

Fair-haired, tall, bare-shouldered, 
bare-armed, barefoot, she wore a 
long, loose, white gown. She was 
beautiful. She was pale. She was 
pure. 

The unseen organist sounded a 
note and she sang: “O God, our 
help in ages past.” Everyone joined 
in, but by ritual she sang the last 
verse alone, her silvery voice soaring 
to the dark emptiness high above: 

If ever I forget the way 

To live the sacred life, 

I trust and pray that on that day 

I feel the sacred knife. 

It was only on this day, watching 
and listening to the High Priestess, 
that Fredi — for the first time — found 
her ritual verse somehow wrong. 
Certainly the rest of the hymn was 
not likely to be attributed to Shake- 
speare; and there was something 
odd, something amiss, in the second 
verse: 



Below the blanket of Thy sky 

Thy folk have slept secure; 

Sufficient just that Thou art nigh 

And our defense is sure. 

But the second-last verse, almost 
a repeat of the first, was clearly the 
original last verse. The High Pries- 
tess’s ritual solo verse had surely 
been added later. 

But it did not matter. Mary could 
sing the alphabet and he would find 
it sheer poetry. 

Mary ... six months ago she 
had been Lori Jones. If Fredi had 
known her then, much might have 
happened. Although even at that 
time she was already under the pro- 
tection of the Temple — a possible 
priestess, a possible High Priestess 
as events had proved — temple girls 
did sometimes leap the wall, take 
lovers, have babies. Now there 
was no chance; Fredi’s love was 
hopeless. 

And he was honest enough to 
admit that when she was Lori 
Jones, she would probably never 
have been more than a Jan Wilson 
to him. A High Priestess had 
glamor — no woman had more. By 
virtually ceasing to be a woman, the 
High Priestess became woman in- 
carnate, unattainable, and therefore 
infinitely desirable. And, paradoxi- 
cally, his own religious leaning had 
played a part in leading him to this 
great sin. 

Now was the time. She stepped 
forward and Preacher Peter crossed 
himself. Then, also moving for- 
ward, he crossed the High Priestess 
too — and in doing so, he deftly 
brushed the two wide straps from 
her shoulders. The white gown 
slowly slid to the floor.

GALAXY 




A faint sigh rose from the audi- 
ence. Mary was pure. The Sun 
never saw her body. There in the 
Temple of God. a thousand people 
saw her body — not brown, not even 
pink, but creamy-ivory. It was 
ethereal, not earthly, certainly not 
earthy. It had the perfection of a 
statue, the clean lines of a statue, 
the smoothness of a statue. The pale 
nipples were tiny and only faintly 
pink. 

She stepped around the gown and 
stood before the preacher. The ritual 
began. 

Fredi wondered at the paradox 
that the Virgin Mother of the Sun 
must never see the Sun; that while 
all the rest of them (except Preacher 
Peter and the other priestesses) were 
about to go out into the Sun on this 
Sunday, she would never feel its 
warmth on her body again. But of 
course religion was full of 
paradoxes. Perhaps the logic behind 
it was that if the Mother of the Sun 
were to give herself to the Sun, it 
would be incestuous. 

“Yes, 1 am pure.” 

“Yes, you are pure. The sacred 
knife will prove to all that you are 
pure, that the Temple is pure, that 
the World is pure, that the World is 
still the World of God.” 

Preacher Peter must be a fair pre- 
stidigitator, Fredi thought profes- 
sionally. You never saw where the 
sacred knife came from. Some of 
the more devout worshipers swore 
that it came into his hand by a 
miracle, but there was nothing said 
about that in the Word of God. 

Peter held the knife firmly in 
both hands, point downward, over 
Mary’s left breast. There was a 
click and a faint hum of machinery. 



The circular panel on which she 
stood revealed itself to be a moving 
pedestal. As it rose toward the 
knife, she sank to her knees; then 
she sat on her heels; although the 
knife did not move, the rising 
pedestal pushed her steadily toward 
it. And as the pedestal rose, it 
turned. Mary had begun the ritual 
with her back to the congregation. 
Slowly her body was revealed in 
profile. 

The knife, never touching, was 
no more than two inches from her. 
Sitting on her heels, she had to arch 
backward to avoid it, her arms 
above her head as the pedestal con- 
tinued to rise and turn. Her hands 
and her long hair touched the floor. 
Her breasts pointed straight up, now 
only an inch from the knife. Below 
her tortured rib cavity her belly 
stretched taut. And still the sacred 
knife was over her, and still the 
pedestal rose. 

Six months earlier another High 
Priestess had died silently as the 
pedestal continued to rise. And 
within the hour the preacher had 
died by the knife; the eleven other 
priestesses were dead by the knife; 
and later a hundred criminals died 
by the knife — until God was ap- 
peased and the knife took no more. 

And the world was once again 
the World of God. 

Today, however, the pedestal 
stopped rising. Mary’s head was on 
the marble, her body racked like a 
violin string. She could go no 
farther. 

Then the knife disappeared and 
she raised herself to a kneeling posi- 
tion, her arms high, as the pedestal 
retraced its travel. Finally she stood 
up and stepped back into the pool

of her gown. A priestess moved 
forward and raised it to her shoul- 
ders. 

Not a word was spoken. The 
ceremony was ended, and all was 
right with the World. 

* * ★ 

The thousand people left the 
Temple — but they did not go home. 
It was exactly noon and the hot Sun 
was directly overhead. 

The crowd spread out over the 
vast forecourt of the Temple. There 
was no ritual involved, no particular 
organization; everyone simply found 
himself or herself six square feet of 
space. 

Then all of their clothes came 
off. They stood, they sat, they 
squatted, they lay full length. It did 
not matter. They were one with the 
Sun. 

After five minutes — five utterly 
silent minutes — some got up, put on 
their clothes and went home. Some 
stayed, spreading themselves as 
their neighbors vacated their spaces. 
Others sought friends and relatives. 

Jan Wilson came upon Fredi from 
behind. He was starting to put on 
his robes but she said: “Leave 
them. Come with me.” 

And nude, they ran into the 
woods together. At first there were 
many couples clustered around, the 
impatient and lazy ones; then, the 
farther they went, only a few; and 
finally none. 

It was pleasantly cool under the 
trees but they had to find at least a 
sunray. It was Sunday, the day of 
the Sun, and they did not have the 
excuse that the sky was overcast. 
The Sun was there and it was a sin 
to hide from the Sun. 



Jan found a grassy bank beside a 
pool and lay down on it, full in the 
Sun. She looked at Fredi 
expectantly — and he rebelled. 

“No!” he said violently. “Ritual 
love is not love. It’s only very ordi- 
nary, very uninteresting sex.” 

“Even when the Sun demands 
it?” 

“The Sun doesn’t demand any- 
thing and you know it.” 

“This from you, Fredi? You, the 
little priest?” 

“The Sun doesn’t demand it,” he 
insisted. 

“Maybe I’m wrong ... I 
thought this was Sunday.” 

“You know perfectly well that all 
Sunday means is that a man who 
wants a girl has an edge. She thinks 
she shouldn’t say no. She thinks if 
she says no, she’s sinning in some 
way. You know that — ” 

“I know that you’ve just been 
lusting after the High Priestess.” 

It was suddenly very still. Fredi 
knew — the moment it was too 
late — that he should have laughed 
incredulously. 

The Temple was the law. The 
Temple judged. He was in no im- 
mediate danger of feeling the sacred 
knife, but he might someday go on 
the list. Then, if the High Priestess 
proved false and God struck, and 
the eleven other priestesses also 
died, and all the more serious crim- 
inals in addition — and if God was 
still not appeased after that, he 
might find himself. 

Jan was smaller than the High 
Priestess but that was not the major 
difference between the two. She 
was brown, brown all over, and 
anything but ethereal. Nude, she 
was earthy. Very attractive, but ear- 



108

thy. In fact, she was at the moment 
literally earthy, having rolled in the 
soft soil and become dusty and 
muddy. She was also sweaty. Al- 
though this did not make her a whit 
less desirable, it did make her a lot 
less like Mary. 

“So?” he said. 

“So since you can’t have her, 
you might as well. ...” 

“That isn’t what you were going 
to say.” 

“No. And it’s not what I’m 
going to say in a minute. Mean- 
time, before the Sun shifts off this 
soft, grassy bank and we have to 
move into that bog over there, what 
about it?” 

He did not really have to force 
himself; at times he had thought he 
was almost in love with Jan Wilson. 
The main drawback was that they 
shared so little in common. 
Whenever he felt particularly ten- 
der, she would be coarse; fur- 
thermore, she seemed to have abso- 
lutely no feeling for art. 

Afterward she said: “Let’s bathe. 
I know you think I’m a peasant and 
you’re a great artist, but you’re 
wrong in a lot of things, Fredi. I’m 
too intelligent to be a peasant, 
you’ll never be a great artist, and 
I’ve always known a hell of a lot 
more than you’ve given me credit 
for.” 

The profanity was no shock; the 
meaning of her words was. And 
without giving him time to recover, 
she went on deliberately: “For 

instance — you don’t know it but 
fundamentally, despite your religi- 
ous aspirations, you’re a Realist.” 

The charge was so serious that 
this time he had to react. Besides, it 
was completely untrue. “You’re 



crazy. I never in my whole life 
came anywhere near — ” 

“I know you never came any- 
where near — in all twelve years of 
your whole life. Oh, yes, I know 
you’re twenty-four, Fredi, but since 
you manage to live at only half the 
speed of most people, you’re really 
only twelve. While I, officially 
nineteen, must be at least forty. 
Forget it. Let’s bathe.” 

They jumped into the pool and 
swam for a while, then emerged 
and lay on the bank, letting the Sun 
dry their bodies. 

And now Jan was pretty — clean 
and brown and smooth all over. 
Fredi toyed with the not-very- 
original thoughts that a girl who 
was small was not therefore less at- 
tractive than a girl who was tall, 
that brown skin in itself was no less 
beautiful than cream-ivory, that the 
nude Jan was not less nubile than 
the nude Mary. He wanted to make 
love again and his hand slid under 
and around her small waist to draw 
her to him 

“As I said, you’re a Realist,” 
she observed coolly. 

He took his hand away. Cool 
water had not extinguished his ar- 
dor. Cool words did. 

“Which gives us something in 
common,” she added. “More than 
you knew, Fredi? Listen and I’ll tell 
you about the Realists. About them, 
about me, about you, about us.” 

“I am not a Realist,” he said 
firmly. “You’re crazy.” 

“I’m not crazy and, yes, you’re 
not a Realist — but only in the sense 
that you don’t know it yet. You 
have to understand that whatever 
else you are, do and think, your 
merely wanting to possess the High 



WORLD OF GOD

Priestess makes you a Realist.” 

He was silent, wondering why 
she had never talked this way be- 
fore. Without his having to ask, she 
told him. 

‘Until today I didn’t think you 
would ever be of any use to us. But 
now I see how you could be. First, 
though, let me tell you about the 



Realists. We’re not against religion, 
not against the Temple. But it’s cor- 
rupt. We’re against the way it’s tak- 
ing over everything. That’s corrupt. 
You’ve heard the saying, ‘Power 
corrupts, and absolute power cor- 
rupts absolutely. ’ Well, the Temple is 
well on the way to taking absolute 
power for itself. You know that”’ 
He relaxed a little. “Theories. If 



110 



GALAXY 



you want to talk theory, I don’t 
mind.” 

“I’m not talking theory. I’m talk- 
ing fact. A hundred years ago the 
Bible was open to all. Now nobody 
gets to see the Bible and the 
preacher reads only selected passag- 
es. How do we know he isn’t mak- 
ing them up? And lately not only 
the Bible but a whole lot of other 
books have been withdrawn. It’s 
going on all the time.” 

Fredi did not care. For a moment 
he had thought she was threatening 
him, trying to blackmail him into 
marrying her or into something else 
he did not particularly want to do. 
But here she was talking calmly and 
reasonably, calmly and reasonably 
trying to involve him in something 
that would — eventually — make an 
appointment for him with the sacred 
knife. 

“Let’s go back,” he said abrupt- 
ly- 

“We can use you, I said. We’ll 
help you and you’ll help us. We’ll 
help you reach the High Priestess.” 

He was, after all, crazy — and he 
knew it. Suddenly he found he was 
listening very closely. Hitherto he 
had taken it for granted that his love 
was hopeless. 

If it were possible — if somehow 
he could one day possess the High 
Priestess — then the threat of a date 
with the sacred knife seemed almost 
irrelevant. 

Jan was going on, rapidly and 
eagerly now: “Can’t you see, Fredi, 
what it would prove if you became 
the High Priestess’s lover and noth- 
ing dire happened? Everyone but 
the Realists believes in that twaddle 
Preacher Peter was spouting. The 
Temple has taken the power it has 



and it will go on taking power until 
the Realists get ahold of something 
big and come out in the open and 
say, ‘Lo and behold, the Temple is 
only a man-made building, the 
preachers are only men and the 
priestesses are only women. The 
Virgin Mother of the Sun is only 
Lori and she’s no virgin, and the 
sacred knife’ doesn’t know a thing 
about it — ” 

“I shouldn’t listen to this.” 

“But you are listening, aren’t 
you? Fredi, we need to do some- 
thing like this. All books tell a little 
of the truth. Now that truth is being 
systematically destroyed. Even just 
a few years ago there were books 
that said we came to this world 
from another world, a world called 
Earth . but that doesn’t square 
with the Temple’s line that we’re 
the Chosen, the only people living 
on the only world. The Bible had 
already been taken from us because 
it was about a planet that was not 
this planet, and if people were al- 
lowed to read it, they would be able 
to figure that out. ...” 

But Fredi was no longer listen- 
ing. The idea of becoming the lover 
of the High Priestess had inflamed 
him; death did not matter if only he 
achieved that. What difference if 
the preachers rewrote history and 
said the world was the only world and 
destroyed a few books? He was an 
actor, not a scholar. 

In full flow, Jan suddenly 
stopped and sighed. “You have 
your own defenses, Fredi, haven’t 
you? One thing I’ve said has in- 
terested you, only one. The rest — ” 

“Yes, the rest. Tell me one thing 
that shows you’re right and the 
Temple is wrong. One thing that 



WORLD OF GOD 



111 




shows we really did come from 
somewhere else — ” 

“Certainly.” She stood up and 
pointed. “Look over there. And 
there. The ruins. ” 

“The ruins? What about them?” 
She looked at him pityingly. 
“They’re not ruins, Fredi. Anybody 
can see that. Even you can see it if 
you look. The Realists saw it and 
that was what made them Realists.” 
“If they’re not ruins, what are 
they?” 

“Well, in a sense they’re ruins 
but — ” 

“Then what are you talking 
about?” 

“Ruins of ships. Vast ships. So 
vast the Temple can’t get rid of 
them. All the Temple can do is to 
say they’re ruins — our ruins, ruins 
of a previous culture on this world. 
But go and look, Fredi. Look at the 
tubes and rusted dials and engines 
and air pipes. They can’t possibly 
be the ruins of houses or any kind 
of static building. They prove that 
we came from somewhere else and 
that this world is not the world.” 

He did not know what to say. 
Her words sounded true . but did 
it really matter that much? 

She sighed again. “Okay. I’ll 
stick to the one subject that turns 
you on — that of how you’re going 
to become the lover of the High 
Priestess.” 

“How?” 

“Well, in the end it’s up to you, 
Fredi. Rape is no use. It proves noth- 
ing. She has to be willing. Well, I 
knew Lori Jones a little. Silly, prig- 
gish bitch. Vain, shallow, always 
certain she was somehow better 
than other people but without any- 
thing to back it up except that she 



was under the umbrella of the Tem- 
ple. Yes, you could win her. 
You’re too handsome by half. Flat- 
ter her, say loving words to her. 
You could manage that bit in your 
sleep. So all you need is opportun- 
ity. And that’s what we’ll give 
you. ” 

* * * 

The next day, Monday, was a 
very different day. There was no 
mass surrender to the Sun, which 
shone just the same. People who 
sunbathed on a Monday, if they 
were lucky enough to have the 
time, were expected to keep some 
clothes on just as on Sunday they 
were expected to remove them all. 
Only Sunday was the day of the 
Sun. 

Fredi, at rehearsal for Macbeth, 
in which he played Macduff, was 
sent to the library to check on a 
technical point. He was not a star. 
His good looks and a fine speaking 
voice were his main talents. 

At the library, having finished his 
chore, he paused. 

Was someone tampering with the 
ancient plays as well? Now that 
would concern him; drama was his 
profession and the new plays were 
gutless. In Shakespearean or Sha- 
vian productions there was always 
something to get your teeth into. 

Vaguely he remembered a Shake- 
spearean play about a king, Richard 
II or Richard III — a king of a place 
called Angland or England. There 
was an impassioned speech about 
“this sceptdred isle, demi-paradise, 
this other Eden.” Evidently it was 
quite a place. Yet there was no 
Angland or England in the World. 



112 



GALAXY 




He checked the list. Richard III 
was there but a quick glance 
showed that this was the wrong 
play. It must be Richard II. 

But there was no Richard II. 

By delayed action he was 
staggered. Could a Shakespearean 
play have been kidnapped, done 
away with, simply because a pass- 
age in it was inconvenient to the 
Temple? 

Impossible! 

Yet not impossible. The library 
was under the direct control of the 
Temple. The preachers were never 
seen at the library; but then, the li- 
brary was wholly theirs when it was 
closed to everyone else. 

Looking through the microfilm 
spools, he realized for the first time 
how easy it would be to cut 
passages out of anything that was 
on microfilm. In the case of bound 
books, such deletions would show; 
but most of the books had disap- 
peared, Microfilm was better, 
cheaper, longer-lasting. 

And with that thought he looked 
more closely at the recent renova- 
tions in the library and saw with 
further shock that while there was 
more space and the arrangement 
was more convenient, it was simply 
because there was less material in 
the same area. 

Books had been printed and still 
were being printed. You could take 
a book home, but not everyone had 
a microfilm viewer. Now that he 
looked around the library with new 
vision, he saw that nearly all the 
books were new, the older ones 
having been transferred tc mic- 
rofilm. 

And microfilm could be censored 
in a matter of minutes — leaving noth- 



ing to show that any tampering 
had been done. 

Behind him a voice said, “Can I 
help you? You seem to be looking 
for something.” 

It was one of the librarians. She 
was about the same age as Mary 
and Jan but there the resemblance 
ended. They were beautiful girls, in 
their different ways; this was just a 
girl. 

He began, “I’m from the 
theater — ” 

“I know, she said eagerly. “You 
were great in the play last week. 
What a pity you were killed in the 
first act. ” 

“Next week we do Macbeth, ” he 
said boldly. “Some of the texts we 
have seem to differ slightly. Could I 
see the oldest, most authentic text 
you have?” 

She looked at him strangely and 
he realized that if something not 
quite right was going on at the li- 
brary, she would have to be pretty 
dumb not to know anything about 
it, whether she was directly in- 
volved or not. But all she said was, 
“Of course.” 

At the viewer, Fredi — who knew 
Macbeth by heart— took a new look 
at the play. 

It was odd that in Scene II the 
text established the fact that Duncan 
was the king, but not what he was 
the king of. And then in Scene III 
the first witch said: “All hail, Mac- 
beth! hail to thee, thane of Peusa!” 
The second witch said: “All hail, 
Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of 
Morden!” 

This was strange because in the 
upcoming production — scheduled to 
be staged in just a week — the 
witches would exclaim exactly the 



WORLD OF GOD 



113 




same words except that the two 
places mentioned were Glamis and 
Cawdor. 

No one knew precisely what a 
thane was but that did not matter; it 
was obviously some sort of a minor 
nobleman. No one knew what or 
where Glamis and Cawdor were, 
but everyone knew Peusa and Mor- 
den. They were areas not more than 
five miles from the Temple. 

So the text had been changed to 
make the setting local. Nothing 
much in that . except that this 
was supposed to be the earliest, 
most authentic text, and it clearly 
was not. The puzzle was: Why did 
the theater have an earlier text, and 
why was it allowed to use it? 

But that was not really much of a 
puzzle. The Temple moved slowly 
and silently in the shadows. Next 
week two old words would be spo- 

114 



ken. Glamis and Cawdor (places on 
Earth?), but the next time Macbeth 
was produced, the more authentic 
text would prevail. Glamis and 
Cawdor would be replaced by Peusa 
and Morden. If anyone queried the 
change, it would be blandly af- 
firmed that recent research had 
shown Peusa and Morden were 
either what Shakespeare had origi- 
nally written or what he had really 
.intended to write. 

It amused him to find that in Act 
II, Scene 3. when Macbeth said: 
“Still it cried ‘Sleep no more!’ to 
all the house: ‘Glamis hath mur- 
der'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor 
shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall 
sleep no more" — the words in the 
text remained Glamis and Cawdor, 
when they should have been Peusa 
and Morden. 

The Preachers of the Temple had 
GALAXY 






missed that. They were not infalli- 
ble. 

* * * 

The Realists, it seemed, were. 
Two nights later they took him to a 
walled garden, telling him that 
Mary would be there, and alone. 
Since she could never see or be 
seen by the Sun, she took the air by 
night in the garden. She was un- 
guarded because no one was sup- 
posed to know of her presence there 
and, further, the wall was meant to 
be unscalable. 

But the Realists knew she would 
be there, and their extending 
aluminum ladder and the rope for 
the descent on the other side re- 
duced the wall to a mere inconveni- 
ence. 

At the last moment Fredi had 
fears, doubts, and an abrupt failure 
of self-confidence. 

“This from you, the great 
lover?” Jan asked sarcastically. The 
two men had not spoken, leaving all 
the talking to her. “Surely snapping 
your fingers will be more than 
enough?” 

“Suppose she screams?” 

“She won’t scream.” 

“How do you know?” 

“I didn’t want to tell you any- 
thing, but since you’ve got cold feet, 
Fredi, I may as well — it’s all set. 
Just get in there and shoot your 
line. It will work. You’re on a sure 
thing.” 

“You know something I don’t 
know?” 

“That’s the understatement of the 
century. I know a hell of a lot of 
things you don’t know. In 
particular — I guess I have to tell 
you this too — we managed to get a 



word of prophecy whispered into 
Lori’s ear. She’s going to meet a 
handsome stranger in romantic cir- 
cumstances. She’ll be looking for 
you, not really expecting you to 
show but her little heart fluttering in 
case you might ... I told you she’s 
a silly bitch.” 

Nonsense, Fredi thought. Mary 
was beautiful and you could see that 
her beauty was only the lovely sur- 
face of a nature of immense depth 
and purity. 

“Just one word of advice,” Jan 
said, “though heaven knows you 
shouldn’t need it. Don’t go all out 
for the jackpot at the first meeting. 
Be romantic. Touch her — hell, 
yes — but be gentle. Make her want 
you, not the other way around.” 
“Oh, I know all about that.” 
“Yes, you do. don’t you? Even 
if it’s the only thing you know.” 

He was young and active. Scaling 
the wall and lowering himself si- 
lently on the other side was an easy 
job. 

He wore silver trunks and a long, 
dark cloak. Jan had chosen the cos- 
tume for him, rather cynically. 
“You’ll need a black cloak because 
we don’t want you to show up 
glowing like a beacon. But you 
have to be the knight in shining 
armor too. And this is the kind of 
scene where you have to be half 
naked and your lady love has to be 
fully dressed — you have to be sexy 
and make her go for you, not the 
other way around. ...” 

Nowhere could it have been 
easier to hide. The garden was full 
of trees, shrubs, bushes, huge tropi- 
cal plants. It also had a maze of 
paths. And, of course, a pool. 

“Get her away from the pool,” 

115 



WORLD OF GOD 




Jan had said. “Get her into the 
shadows. If you can’t see a win- 
dow, nobody behind a window can 
see you.” 

And true enough, there Mary 
was, seated by the pool, wearing 
the obligatory white robe. 

Six feet away from her, hidden in 
the bushes, he said softly, “Well, it 
was worth it.” 

She turned, startled. 

“Please don’t do that,” he said 
conversationally. “Somebody might 
be watching. Why not just get up 
casually and wander into the bushes 
for a stroll?” 

“Why should I?” 

That wonderful voice. “Well, I 
can see you. If you don’t want to 
see me, you’re not a real woman.” 
“You might . harm me.” 
“Then you can scream and 
people will come running. But why 
scream until you know whether you 
want to or not?” 

She stood up, looked around the 
garden and moved slowly toward 
him. 

When he touched her, it was 
from behind, and gently . but he 
held her firm when she tried to turn 
around. “I could be ugly,” he said 
softly. “I could be old and fat.” 
“You’re not ugly. And you have 
a beautiful voice.” 

“No, I’m not ugly. But com- 
pared with you — ” 

“You think I’m pretty?” The 
question was coy, banal, so ineptly 
arch that Fredi winced. Nevertheless 
it was an invitation, and that was what 
he was looking for. 

“No, you’re not pretty at all. 
You’re so incredibly lovely that I 
had to speak to you, no matter what 
happens. ” 



His own words were not particu- 
larly poetic either but he meant 
them, and his ringing sincerity did 
not fail to make an effect. 

He released her and they faced 
one another there in the luminous 
night. 

Ten minutes later, no more, he 
climbed the rope and descended the 
ladder. The two men hurried away 
with them. Jan took him at least 
two hundred yards from the wall of 
the Temple gardens before asking: 
“Well?” 

“Yes.” 

“What do you mean, yes?” 

“All’s well. What a wonderful 
girl she is — ” 

“Never mind that. What did she 
think of you?” 

“That’s all right.” 

“You came away pretty soon.” 

“I had to. I had achieved, I 
think, the maximum effect. If I had 
stayed longer ... but you don’t 
understand these things.” 

“I understand too well, you 
mean. You made another date?” 
“No. But she’ll expect me.” 
“Good enough. Now are you 
frustrated enough to cast your pearls 
before me?” 

“No,” Fredi said serenely. “I 
love Lori; I told you that. I can’t 
love anyone else.” 

“So she’s Lori now. How did 
that come about?” 

“It was mainly her idea but I 
went along with it. I think the 
theory is that as Mary she couldn’t 
possibly speak to me and certainly 
she could not let me kiss her, but as 
Lori — ” 

“I get it. Okay, you seem to 
have things in hand . did you 
kiss her, by the way?” 



116 



GALAXY 




“On our first date?” Fredi 
exclaimed, shocked. “And she the 
High Priestess?” 

Jan was silent for several sec- 
onds. Then she said, “Sometimes, 
Fredi, I get the uneasy feeling that 
you’re not such a fool as you 
look.” 

“Who is?” 

* * * 

It puzzled Fredi that the meetings 
were arranged so easily. Night after 
night he spent an hour with the 
High Priestess in the Temple gar- 
dens. It was all so simple, and no 
one ever came near them. 

Jan, when he mentioned the mat- 
ter to her, said coolly, “Well, why 
not? The High Priestess is some- 
thing big on Sunday but the rest of 
the week she’s just a silly girl, still 
just Lori Jones, whom nobody 
bothers much about. Who cares if 
she’s sitting in the gardens or hav- 
ing a bath or admiring her own 
boobs and belly or trying to read a 
book?” 

And on Saturday night Fredi felt 
that it was time. He had flattered 
Lori — as Jan and his own instinct 
had told him to do — and. she had 
thawed and met him at least half- 
way, wanting to believe him, find- 
ing him an overpoweringly romantic 
figure, yearning to love him and be 
loved herself. 

All the time, however, she re- 
membered that she was the High 
Priestess. When Fredi’s fingertips 
touched her as Preacher Peter 
touched her, when his hands were 
cool and gentle, she guided them 
willingly but without sexual re- 
sponse. There was, something in the 



Bible about the “laying on of 
hands.” It was right, it was wholly 
innocent, that he should touch her 
face, her arms, her shoulders, even 
her breasts, waist and hips, as long 
as his touch was tender and wor- 
shipful, as long as she kept his 
touch tender and worshipful. And 
Fredi, reading her right, touched her 
as she wanted to be touched. 

They even — one night when it 
was so dark they could not possibly 
be seen from any window — swam 
in the pool, and Fredi’s touch this 
time was on bare flesh. He deliber- 
ately kept it, however, the same 
cool, innocent touch, accustomizing 
her to being naked with him and 
still pure, as pure as when the robe 
slid down her body in the Temple 
and thousands saw her and no 
shadow was cast on her purity. 

On Saturday, therefore, it meant 
nothing unusual when they stood 
together in one of the sheltered 
clearings they now knew so well. 
Their clothes had been left behind. 
But this time Fredi’s words were 
more personal and his touch more 
questing, more insistent — for the 
first time like that of a virile young 
man touching a nubile young wom- 
an. 

“It has to be,” he whispered. 
“No,” she said, not responding. 
“All along you’ve known it. I’ve 
waited, and now you know that all I 
have ever said to you is true. I’ve 
proved it by my patience.” 

“Nothing we have ever done or 
said has been wrong. But now — ” 
“Now if we don’t acknowledge 
our love, it has all been a lie.” 

His touch, still tender, was no 
longer cool. It demanded, and she 
fought not to answer yes, not to an-

swer at all — and failed. Her breasts 
grew to touch his; her arms, trying 
to keep him away; drew him to her; 
and her lithe belly, straining away 
from him as in the climax of the 
Sunday ceremony, suddenly ceased 
to be the hard, tight belly of a High 
Priestess or a marble statue and be- 
came the warm belly of a woman. 

“No,” she said, and in the same 
breath — half a breath, half a 
gasp — “Yes, yes. ” 

* * * 

Fredi did not want to go to the 
Temple. Neither Jan nor any other 
Realist had said anything to him 
beyond brief words of satisfaction 
that — as they put it — he had rung 
the bell. He had no idea of what 
they intended to do in the Temple 
but he remembered what Jan had 
threatened to say: “Lo and behold, 
the Temple is only a man-made 
building, the preachers are only 
men and the priestesses are, only 
women. The Virgin Mother of the 
Sun is only Lori Jones, and she’s 
no virgin, and the sacred knife 
doesn’t know a thing about it.” 

The last phrase meant that at least 
the Realists were not going to raise 
a stir until the last part of the cere- 
mony was over; it also strongly 
suggested they would indeed then 
do something, and Fredi was uneasy 
about it. 

It was all very well to say that if 
he won the High Priestess, nothing 
else mattered. Today it was a dif- 
ferent situation. Perhaps last night, 
at the height of his passion, he 
would have shouted his agreement, 
his willingness to die rather than 
draw back . but today he was 



alive, and he wanted to stay alive. 

As usual, he was near the front 
of the Temple, where Mary (today 
she was Mary) would be. He did 
not know where Jan was. He never 
went to the Temple with Jan, al- 
though she invariably sought him 
out afterward. Would she do that 
today? Would she expect him to 
make love to her today? He shied 
away from the thought and concen- 
trated on the service. 

Today Preacher Paul was in 
charge. He was a small man, lack- 
ing the presence of Preacher Peter; 
the big, rolling words in his mouth 
did not sound nearly as impressive. 

“And I say unto you, in the 
Word of God in this Temple of God 
in the World of God, the Sun is 
most wondrous, the Sun of God 
gives us life, praise the Sun of 
God. ...” 

Suppose, Fredi thought with sud- 
den hope, that Mary, like Preacher 
Peter, did not appear today. It was 
rare for the High Priestess not to 
play her part in the ceremony. 
There were twelve preachers, but 
only one High Priestess. On the 
other hand, there were eleven other 
priestesses and occasionally one of 
them stood in for the High Priest- 
ess. 

Should that happen today, Fredi ’s 
vague feeling of uneasiness would 
be dissipated and he could go on 
living from day to day with little or 
no thought of the morrow. As long 
as Mary did not appear, it was 
reasonably certain that the ceremony 
would be uneventful. 

Suddenly the priestesses entered 
through the pillared arch — and lead- 
ing them was Mary. At the sight of 
her Fredi could scarcely restrain 



118 



GALAXY 




himself from shouting above 
Preacher Paul’s pale voice, although 
what he would have shouted he did 
not know. 

At the same time Fredi relaxed a 
little because Mary was as serene as 
ever, he had to remind himself by 
concentrating hard on realistic de- 
tails that the events of the past week 
had actually happened, that today 
was not a week earlier. Even then it 
took a glance at Preacher Paul — not 
Preacher Peter — to confirm that this 
was, in fact, another Sunday. 

Mary led the singing of “O God 
our help in ages past” and then, as 
usual, sang the last verse alone: 

If ever I forget the way 

To live the sacred life 

I trust and pray that on that day 

I feel the sacred knife. 

Fredi ’s emotions were in turmoil. 
He did not know if he loved her. 
He did not know anything for sure. 

Certainly Mary was not in tur- 
moil. Possibly as a woman in love, 
she felt completely sure of herself, 
sure of him, and sure that their love 
was not a mortal sin. But . was 
it a mortal sin? Could it be so right 
for him to leave the Temple and 
take part in pagan, erotic Sun rites 
with Jan, and so wrong for him to 
make love with the High Priestess 
six days later? 

Was she serene because she had 
decided with calm certainty that she 
could be Mary, High Priestess and 
Virgin Mother of the Sun, and at 
the same time Lori Jones, 
passionate lover of actor Fredi? 

She stepped forward and Paul 
crossed himself. Then he crossed 
Mary. Not as deft as Preacher Pe- 



ter, he fumbled while brushing the 
white straps from her shoulders and 
had to do it again. 

As Lori’s slim, ivory body 
emerged from the descending gown, 
Fredi felt a pang of jealousy that 
thousands of others were seeing the 
lovely body that was his and only 
his. The feeling was gone at once 
when he reminded himself that this 
was Mary, not Lori. Mary belonged 
to everybody and nobody, but Lori 
belonged to him. And later, not on 
Sunday but tomorrow, in the weeks 
ahead, she would be Lori again. 

The sacred knife emerged, but 
not with the panache of Preacher 
Peter. 

Mary was on the plinth. It moved 
as before, and as before she 
dropped slowly to her knees and 
then began the slow, agonizing 
stretch backward, the plinth turning 
and the knife remaining just above 
her left breast. Back she went, the 
long hollow below her ribs 
lengthening and deepening; yet as 
her belly stretched, her breasts 
seemed to grow, straining toward 
the sacred knife. It was all over 
in an instant. No one was able to 
say afterward whether the plinth 
suddenly rose, whether Paul stum- 
bled or whether Mary rose spasmod- 
ically to take the knife. However it 
came about, the knife was in her 
heart and then, red and dripping, it 
remained poised in Paul’s quivering 
hands as she slid back, silent, her 
eyes beginning to glaze in death. 

Preacher Peter would have re- 
tained his dignity. Preacher Paul let 
his shock, horror, anguish and ter- 
ror show. Yet he knew what he had 
to do and he did it. Before Mary 
was dead, he himself was dying.

the knife plunged into his own 
breast and remaining there. 

He slumped and would have fall- 
en over the body of the High Pries- 
tess but for the fact that the plinth 
was still high and he was not tall. 
He slid down its side and preacher 
and priestess made a grim yet 
somehow beautiful tableau, the 
lovely woman dying on the still- 
moving plinth, one arm drooping 
from it, the man in the robes of the 
preacher at her feet. 

Such moments were supposed to 
command complete silence . but 
of course such moments were not 
supposed to occur at all. The temple 
trembled when the High Priestess 
proved wanting; the whole World of 
God trembled. It was a dark day 
and the best that could be hoped for 
was that something good would 
come of it. 

There was now complete silence. 
The eleven priestesses knew that 
they must also die. The congrega- 
tion knew that they were as good as 
dead, that their suspended sentences 
were now active convictions and 
that there was no escape. 

It was chaos. 

* * * 

How much time passed Frcdi had 
no idea. The priestess and the 
preacher lay dead now. The plinth 
had returned to its place and no 
longer moved. 

Many had gone; indeed, most had 
gone. But the Temple was by no 
means empty. While the reaction of 
some, the majority, was to flee the 
scene of horror as soon as possible, 
the reaction of many others, nearly 
a hundred, was to stay rooted to the 



spot, staring and praying. 

There was a touch from behind 
on Fredi’s shoulder. Jan, naturally. 
And then a voice that was not 
Jan’s. 

“I can see how deeply this has 
affected you. But life must go on. 
The Word must go on. Actor Fredi, 
your devoutness has not gone un- 
noticed. There will have to be a 
new Preacher Paul. Come with me. 
Preacher Paul . ’ ’ 

Fredi turned, stricken. It was 
Preacher Peter. 

Fredi could not think clearly and, 
therefore, wisely he did not speak. 
He knew that while the priestesses 
were nurtured under the protection 
of the Temple — Jan, for instance, 
could never be a priestess — the 
preachers had all been men of the 
World. They were chosen at times 
of crisis. 

He was Chosen. 

The irony of it did not occur to 
him. To cease to be actor Fredi, to 
become Preacher Paul, seemed emi- 
nently reasonable. He could not un- 
derstand why he had not expected 
it. 

He would preach the Word in the 
Temple of God in the* World of 
God. He would be a good preacher, 
a better preacher than he was an ac- 
tor. He was trained for this. 

Jan and the Realists were de- 
feated. Some of them would have to 
die. But he would not die, not now. 
He would serve God. 

And if in the future, on a Sunday 
when he held the sacred knife, 
some High Priestess died as Mary 
had, he would die too, and perhaps 
that would be ultimate justice. In 
the meantime, he would serve 
God. ★

Too much

Carl was walking down the 
street when he came unglued. It 
was a most curious event. Preceded 
by a lifetime of near-normal be- 
havior, it was all the more surpris- 
ing. He had been on his lunch 
break, heading down to Pop’s for 
his usual corned beef sandwich and 
short beer when he fell flat on his 
face. He kept repeating the word 
“drugstore” as he lay on the 
sidewalk. “Drugstore, drugstore, 
drugstore,” he said. It was the 
word he had been saying when he 
fell down. He was stuck there. 
“Drugstore, drugstore, drugstore,” 
he said until they came and took 
him away to a hospital with soft 
padded walls. His family was 
stunned, the neighbors talked about 
it at great length. His mistress was 
crushed; she had been with him 
when he fell. She was the only one 
who would make the long drive out 
to visit him. He never recognized 
her. They labeled him schizophrenic 
and threw away the key. She drove 
hours just to sit by his bed and talk 
to him. “Drugstore,” he would 
say. “Dammit,” she would say. 
Actually, he wasn’t schizophrenic at 
all. 

Dr. Moore was in the middle of a 
complex surgical procedure. He had 
trained at Johns Hopkins and was 
very good at this particular complex 
surgical procedure. People came 
from all over the world to have him 
carve up their bodies. They had lots 
of confidence in him and his Johns 



Hopkins training. “Retractor,” he 
said to the nurse. As the nurse 
started to put the retractor in his 
hand, he dropped the patient’s kid- 
ney on the floor. “Retractor, retrac- 
tor,” said Dr. Moore. “You have 
the retractor,” said the nurse, pick- 
ing up the kidney. She was worried. 
This was going to be hard to ex- 
plain. She was afraid of a malprac- 
tice suit. The patient was very weal- 
thy and his kidney was covered 
with germs. If he lived, he wasn’t 
going to be very happy and if he 
didn’t, his family wasn’t going to 
be very happy. Nobody was going 
to be happy. “Retractor,” said Dr. 
Moore. He looked like he was 
about to fall down. She dropped the 
kidney back into the patient and 
walked out of the operating room. 
She had always wanted to be a bal- 
lerina. 

Crazy Joe Wobbles was a disc 
jockey and he was already crazy. 
He had a habit of doing strange 
things on the air, but as long as his 
ratings held, the station would leave 
him alone. Once he had played ten 
solid hours of Alka-Seltzer com- 
mercials. His fans went wild. Teen- 
age girls throughout the city wore 
t-shirts printed with his picture. “I 
Love Joe Wobbles” it said across 
their tiny breasts. He was as crazy 
as a bedbug and the most popular 
radio personality in the 12 to 16 age 
group. The station tolerated his 
weird behavior because the 12 to 16 
age group had more money to spend 
than their parents. He had locked 
himself in the broadcast booth and 
was playing Bob Dylan records 
backwards. He had been in there for 
five hours when his mind boggled. 
Any sane man would have cracked

in two. “Dylan’s biggest hit, hit, 
hit,” he said. “Hit, hit, hit,” he 
continued. It was 45 minutes before 
anyone noticed anything unusual. 
“Hit, hit,” he said. They tried to 
unlock the door and found that he 
had bolted it from inside. They tried 
to cut the power but found that he 
had bypassed the main systems. 
Crazy Joe was also paranoid. “Hit, 
hit,” he said and 50,000 watts of 
listening power blasted him for 
miles. His ratings soared, everyone 
was tuning him in. Tunning on Joe 
Wobbles became an instant fad. At 
night you could pick him up as far 
away as New Orleans. It was a gas, 
and the station didn’t try quite as 
hard to cut him off. It was three 
days before a man from the FCC 
kicked down the door and pulled 
the plug on poor Joe. His eyes were 
bloodshot, his voice reduced to a 
whisper “Hit, hit, hit,” he whis- 
pered as they carried him out. 

Pretty soon there were so many 
people being hauled away that they 
ran out of places to haul them away 
to. It was very confusing. People all 
over the country were snapping like 
twigs, running amok at the drop of 
a hat. It was getting so that you 
couldn’t go anywhere without run- 
ning into a couple of crazies. 

Something had to be done. 

That was when Dr. William W. 
Williams arrived with his little 
green box full of 3x5 cards. They 
thought he was crazy, too. These 
same people would have laughed at 
the Wright brothers. It was a long 
time before Dr. William W. Will- 
iams could get anyone to listen to 
him and when he did, it wasn’t any- 
one important. However, this par- 
ticular assistant to the assistant saw 



through the rumpled clothing, the 
wiry hair, the scraggly beard and 
thought he detected a glimmer of 
truth in what the old geezer with the 
green file box full of 3x5 cards had 
to say. So the assistant to the assis- 
tant sent Williams and his cards up- 
stairs. Better than nothing, he 
thought, and moved some more pa- 
pers around. 

Upstairs, Dr. William W. Will- 
iams turned on the charm. He 
flashed a big smile and started right 
in on his scientific explanation of 
the Loonies. 

The secretary was unimpressed. 
She popped her gum and pressed a 
button on her intercom. Old Bill 
had made another mistake. 

“A crackpot here to see you,” 
she said into the little box on her 
desk. 

“Send the crackpot in,” the little 
box said back to her. 

Actually, Dr. Williams had ar- 
rived at the right place at the right 
time. The person he was going in to 
see was one Arthur J. Woods, assis- 
tant to the head of the P.C.L. — 
Presidential Commission on the 
Loonies. He had just come back 
from lunch and four martinis on his 
expense account, so he was per- 
fectly happy to sit back, smoke a 
cigar and listen to what Old Bill 
had to say. 

“I have a theory,” said Bill. 

“Everyone has a theory,” said 
Mr. Arthur J. Woods. 

“But mine is based on a scien- 
tific fact/’ 

“That’s different? What scientific 
fact?” 

“The fact that you can’t get ten 
pounds of fertilizer into a five 
pound bag.” 



A SCIENTIFIC FACT 



123 




“That’s news?” He puffed on his 
cigar. 

“Look at this.” Williams placed 
his green file box on Mr. Woods’ 
desk. “This is a human brain.” 

“No it’s not. It’s a green box.” 

“Use your head. Imagine it’s a 
brain. ” 

Woods frowned and scratched his 
nose. Williams pulled out a bunch 
of blank 3x5 cards and put them on 
the desk. 

“These are pieces of informa- 
tion,” Williams said, indicating the 
cards. 

“They look like 3x5 cards to 
me.” 

Williams rolled his eyes and 
sighed. 

“The box is like a brain,” he 
said, stuffing cards into the box. 
“Just as there is a limit to the 
number of cards you can fit into the 
box, there is a limit to the number 
of pieces of information you can fit 
into a brain. They both get full. 
See?” He held out the filled box. 

Woods took it and tried to put 
another card inside. He couldn’t. 

“That’s one full box,” admitted 
Woods. “But why would this be 
happening now? We ought to have 
seen this particular effect before.” 

“The idiot box.” Williams’ eyes 
were gleaming. He was getting 
through. 

“You mean the tube?” 

“Exactly. You may not realize 
this, Mr. Woods, but television is 
produced by a rolling scan of some 
525 lines thirty times a second. Al- 
though the conscious mind connects 
all these separate images into con- 
tinous action, somewhere, deep in 
the brain, all these separate images 
are counted, stacked up and filed 



away. Soon we are all filled up like 
the box! And us . aha!” 

“Aha?” 

“Us. We are the first generation 
to be completely suckled from the 
teat of the tube. We have a lifetime 
of images stacked up one on top of 
the other. We are filled up as no 
other generation has ever been. 
There is no more room in the boxes 
of our brains for any more 3x5 
cards.” 

“Maybe just a couple?” asked 
Woods, but he already knew the an- 
swer. 

The wheels of the nation can 
move pretty fast when they’re 
pushed and the crush of Loonies 
was pushing things pretty hard. 
Within a week, the battle plan had 
been worked out. 

The President would have to go 
on TV to tell everyone that they 
couldn’t watch TV anymore. It 
might work. He was a fairly popu- 
lar president, it was possible he 
could pull it off. There ’d be a lot of 
opposition, but he had faith in Dr, 
W'illiams W. Williams’ little green 
box and stack of 3x5 cards. He had 
them right beside him in the televi- 
sion studio. They were just props, 
though. The P.C.L. had prepared an 
excellent film explaining the Loonie 
Effect, or Tube Fever as those in 
the know had taken to calling it. 
Thankfully, the President wouldn’t 
have to do any scientific explaining 
or use any big words; all he had to 
do was introduce the film. 

Air time. The red light of the 
camera went on. It was just one 
more piece of information, one 
more 3x5 card sliding into place.

Here we present a story that is 
largely “autobiographical”! 



The echoing sound of Simon 
Wells’s footsteps on the plascrete 
floor of the parking garage roused 
the shabby black sedan in slot 3003 
and it mumbled querulously to itself 
in Chinese, 

Startled, Simon stopped abruptly 
and the half-dozen tools concealed 
in the lining of his jacket bumped 
painfully against his ribs. Part of 
him, the empathetic half of his na- 
ture that made him a highly re- 
spected and well-paid mechanic, 
recognized that this was a car in 
trouble. The darker, hidden side of 
his personality that made him a suc- 
cessful assassin shrieked that some- 
thing was wrong. 

His high-priced special service 
had never been contracted for a 
common import before. The flashy 
red sports model in slot 3004 was a 
much more likely candidate. All 
Kane had given him over the phone 
was the slot number and Simon 
wondered if there was some mis- 
take, Or maybe — and for a moment 
the breath froze inside his chest — 
maybe it was a trap with police or 
insurance agents waiting for him to 
spring it. 

The black sedan mumbled on in a 
doddering voice — something about a 
broken bowl and spilled rice. 
Chinese was one of the dozen lan- 
guages a skilled mechanic had to 



know and normally Simon was a 
good listener but now he was too 
preoccupied to follow the sedan’s 
words. Besides, they made little 
sense. The brain was obviously old 
and wandering in time. 

Simon dismissed the threat of a 
trap.' Kane’s operatives never got 
caught. A substantial amount of 
Kane’s fees went to see to that. 
Paranoia, Simon thought. He 
should work for Kane more often or 
give up entirely this maniac switch- 
ing from healer to killer. But he 
knew he could do neither. 

“Get to work,” he growled at 
himself. Still he hesitated, glancing 
nervously around the garage. Only a 
few cars remained on level three 
and of them only the sports model 
in slot 3004 was close enough to 
hear or see anything. It appeared to 
be dormant with front and back sen- 
sors shuttered but you could never 
tell for sure. Less than ideal condi- 
tions, Simon thought, but then a 
brain assassin seldom finds the per- 
fect time and place. 

Simon took a deep breath and 
approached the black sedan with the 
purposeful stride of a rightful 
owner. Up close, it looked like an 
even more unlikely prospect. The 
shutter on its left front sensor had 
rusted off and the sensor itself was 
pitted and pockmarked. The poor 



126 



GALAXY 




thing was half-blind as well as 
senile. The auto insurance couldn’t 
possibly bring enough to cover 
Kane’s fee. The owner must be 
crazy. 

He addressed the black sedan in 
Chinese. For a moment it perked up 
like an old dog that thinks it hears 
its master’s voice and then it sank 
back into its rambling conversation 
with itself. Simon sighed and 
reached into the lining of his jacket 
for his tools. It wouldn’t take long 
and in this case it would be a mercy 
killing rather than murder. 

" “Is that your car?’’ The voice 
was lush, female, and familiar in a 
haunting way. 

He whirled but there was no one 
behind him except the red sports 
model,' its sensors now unshuttered. 
He hastily stuffed the tools back 
into his jacket. This car was a lux- 
ury model with side sensors front 
and back. He wondered how much 
it had seen. “And if it is?” 

“Move it,” the sports model or- 
dered imperiously. “It’s in my slot. 
I’ve tried and tried to make it 
move, but I can’t get through to 
it.” The voice paused and then 
went on, softer, sexier. “Please 
move it. I don’t want to call the 
security guards. They’re always so 
rude. But I need to be in that slot.” 

Several things came clear at 
once. For one, he had been right 
about a mistake — the red car was 
definitely his victim. And two, 
Kane should have asked for a big- 
ger fee. He could tell by the voice 
this was a Cauc brain and that 
meant it was insured for a bundle. 
In the Asian countries where popu- 
lations had mushroomed out of 
proportion, braining a car or a soft- 



drink machine seemed like luxury 
living compared to standing on each 
other’s shoulders, straining for a 
wisp of air to breathe. But in the West 
Bloc, where the birthrate had fallen, 
life was Utopian by comparison. 
Cauc brains were hard to come by 
and the price was astronomical. 

“What are you, paralyzed?” the 
sports model snapped impatiently. 
“Move that wreck!” 

“In a minute,” Simon said. 
“I’ve never run across a Cauc- 
brained car before.” A lie, but he 
made it sound convincing — another 
reason he was a good mechanic. 
“I’d like — ” 

“I know.” The voice was low, 
husky, and extremely bitter. “You 
want to know what a nice girl like 
me is doing in a place like this. 
That’s what everyone wants to 
know. That’s why I don’t usually 
talk to strangers. The answer is that 
the only other thing I’d have been 
good for was chopped meat, thanks 
to a senile brain like your friend 
there that couldn’t pilot a two-ton 
truck down his own side of the 
highway. Satisfied?” 

“Want to talk about it?” he said 
soothingly, wondering where he had 
heard that voice before. 

“Wait a minute,” she said. “I 
recognize that smooth tone of voice. 
You’re a mechanic, right? Did my 
owner have you drop by to work on 
me? Get me over my little fit of de- 
pression?” 

“No, I—” 

“Well, go back and tell him it 
won’t work. He may have signed 
that trick contract with my agent but 
that doesn’t mean I have to be 
happy with it. Tell him that.” 
Suddenly the voice clicked into

SOMEONE TO TALK TO 




place in Simon’s memory, “You’re 
Amanda Everheart, ” he blurted out 
and then wished he hadn’t because 
the sports model slammed all sen- 
sors shut and went completely dor- 
mant. 

“Miss Everheart! Amanda! I 
know you’re upset, but maybe I can 
help you.” 

The sensors remained shuttered. 
Behind him, the black sedan whined 
something about rats. 

“Please, Amanda! I’ve felt every 
picture you ever made.” 

On the other side of the parking 
garage the lift door opened and two 
security guards got out and came 
toward him purposefully. They 
stopped in front of him, hands hov- 
ering suggestively over their 
holsters. “I.D.,” said the larger 
one. 

Simon, rattled by the sports mod- 
el’s identity, pulled out his real I.D., 
instead of Kane’s carefully counter- 
feited fakes. The guard took it be- 
fore Simon could recover and he 
had no choice except to stand there 
feeling the tools in his jacket grow- 
ing heavier by the moment. 

The second guard, the shorter 
one, waved at the sports model. 
“This car complained you were 
bothering her. Do you have authori- 
zation to be here?” 

“Hey! This guy’s a mechanic, 
Pete.” 

Pete relaxed visibly. “Which 
one’s your patient?” 

“I was supposed to check out 
this sedan.” Simon forced a grin. 
“I think the sports model is a little 
nervous.” 

The sports model roared into life, 
unshuttered all sensors and backed 
toward them. The two guards 

128 



jumped one way and Simon flat- 
tened himself against the sedan. The 
sports model ' sped toward the exit 
ramp and disappeared down it with 
a squeal of tires. 

“That brain’s over the hill,” the 
big guard yelled. “It oughta be re- 
tired.” 

“You want to be the one to tell 
Richmond Dukker his new brain’s 
gone already?” Pete asked him. 

Simon recognized the name. If 
anyone had enough money to con- 
tract for the brain of Amanda 
Everheart, it was Dukker. 

“What about it. Buddy?” Pete 
asked Simon. “Did Dukker hire 
you to straighten out his new 
brain?” 

“I’m not at liberty to say,” 
Simon said. He winked. 

They slapped him on the back 
and let him go. 

As soon as Simon reached a 
freephone, he called Kane. 

“What happened?” Kane yelled. 
“The party of the first part has 
called twice complaining about no 
results. This is the first time you 
haven’t come through, Simon.” 

“The wrong car was in the slot. 
I’ve got the right one pegged. Give 
me a little while. ” 

“This party wants a new man,” 
Kane said. “I’m getting someone 
else lined up now.” 

“This customer is stringing you a 
line. The brain on that car is a 
Caucasian.” 

The line went dead for a mo- 
ment. 

“Kane?” 

“A Cauc brain? Do you know 
what the insurance settlement will 
be?” 

“I can guess. Maybe you want to 
GALAXY 




make a new deal with the party of 
the first part?” 

“Damn right,” Kane said. 

“And, Kane, did this party have a 
female voice?” 

“How did you know?” 

“A lucky guess. Make your deal 
and get back to me.” 

“Sure.” Kane said and discon- 
nected. 

* * * 

His car was still where he left it. 
Another fifteen minutes and it 
■would have gone on without him, 
following his instructions. He had 
bought the brain secondhand and in- 
stalled it himself. It was a healthy 
brain, good for another five years at 
least with proper care. Home, he 
told it, and then leaned back and 
listened. Tonight it wanted to talk 
about growing up in Bombay. He 
had heard that story before, but he 
listened as intently as if it were the 
first time. He' was a good listener, 
that was why he had become a 
mechanic in the first place. Other 
people’s lives, other people’s prob- 
lems, had always overwhelmed his 
own. He always wound up listening 
to them instead of unburdening 
himself. Being a good listener — that 
was the first prerequisite for being a 
good mechanic. Having a flair for 
languages was another, because it 
was the non-English-speaking brains 
that needed the most work. People 
bought them because they were 
cheap and then wouldn’t go to the 
trouble to learn enough of the lan- 
guage for proper maintenance. He 
thought about the old sedan. More 
than half the brains were Chinese, 
so many that the Chinese were sus-

pected of breeding just for the sake 
of brains to export. Maybe that was 
the reason they deteriorated so 
rapidly. More likely, it was because 
there weren’t enough owners with a 
command of Chinese and the 
cheapskates who bought a foreign 
brain wouldn’t lay out the credit for 
a skilled mechanic. It was cheaper 
to buy a new brain. Simon thought 
angrily of the countless brains 
dwindling down into insanity when 
all they needed was someone to talk 
to. 

But he was no better. There was 
a limit to how much he could ab- 
sorb. Being a mechanic was like 
being a bottle. You could listen just 
so long and you were full. Then 
you had to do something to empty 
yourself of other people’s lives, 
something to make room for your 
own. It was when that time came 
round that he took a contract from 
Kane. 

* * * 

His apartment brain told him 
Kane had called. Simon returned 
the call. 

“The deal is set, but you’re 
out,’’ Kane told him. 

“Out? Why?” 

“The party asked for another 
man. ” 

“Same party?” 

“Same party.” 

So what he had suspected was 
true. Amanda Everheart had taken 
out the contract on herself. He re- 
membered how all the stories about 
her had played up her death wish. It 
must not have been solely for pub- 
licity. 

“Look, Kane, I’ll do it for the 
130 



original amount we agreed on.” 
“You’re kidding!” 

“Not a bit. I want this contract.” 
“You got it. But do it good. I 
got a reputation to keep up.” 

“Give me till midnight. ” ' 

“Just don’t let me down,” Kane 
said and gave him the address. 

“Don’t worry, Kane. It’s as good 
as done,” Simon lied. 

He hung up and asked the apart- 
ment if it was listening. 

“Sure, Simon.” 

“I want you to — ” 

“Let me tell you what happened 
today,” the brain said and launched 
off while Simon waited impatiently 
for a pause. 

When it came at long last, Simon 
said, “Call down for the car. I’ve 
got some unfinished business to 
take care of.” 

* * * 

The gates of Richmond Dukker’s 
mansion were guarded by the latest 
model mech-dogs, but when they 
found out he was a mechanic, they 
let him through without question. 
Amanda Everheart in the form of a 
flashy red sports model was in the 
garage. 

All sensors were unshuttered and 
the sports model was almost trem- 
bling with anticipation. When he 
came in, the sensors abruptly shut- 
tered and then Amanda thought bet- 
ter of it. “You!” she said accus- 
ingly. “I thought so. Well. Get it 
over with.” 

“Look, Amanda. Miss Everheart. 
I can get you out of this contract 
with Dukker. I know a lawyer 
who — ” 

“Not a chance. It’s a perfectly 
GALAXY 




legal contract. It can’t be broken. 
That's the only way Cheyney makes 
them. ” 

“Cheyney?” 

“Cheyney Brice, my agent.” 
Simon whistled. If Cheyney Brice 
was involved, the contract was un- 
breakable, all right. He handled half 
the Congress and three-quarters of 
the House of Representatives. There 
were even rumors that he had ad- 
vised the President on an informal 
basis. “Why did you sign the con- 
tract in the first place? Surely you 
would have been happier in a less 
menial position.” 

“Wrong. What I wanted was an 
unbreakable contract as a Crackle 
Cola dispenser, but Cheyney got to- 
gether with Richmond Dukker and 
sold me down the river. Or the 
highway, if you prefer.” She 
laughed bitterly. 

“You don’t know what you’re 
saying. No one ever talks to a 
Crackle Cola dispenser and the 
company won’t hire mechanics to 
service them. It’s cheaper to buy a 
half-senile brain and get every bit of 
use out of it. Those brains last less 
than a year. ” 

"That long?” The red car shud- 
dered perceptibly. “I had hoped it 
would be quicker. ” 

She was really suicidal. It was no 
use talking to her. Simon turned 
toward the door. 

“Where are you going? Aren’t 
you going to do it? I’ve already 
paid you. " 

“There’s plenty of time. I’ve got 
till midnight. ” 

“That’s what you think.” 

“Don’t get so upset,” he told 
her. “After midnight it won’t mat- 
ter any more. Nothing will.”

Simon made and discarded half a 
dozen plans for getting in to see 
Cheyney Brice on the way to the 
agent’s apartment. But in the end, it 
turned out that no subterfuge was 
necessary. He gave his name to the 
door and found Cheyney Brice had 
left word for him to come up. 

Brice was short, bald and mad. 
“I want to know what’s going on,” 
he demanded as soon as his apart- 
ment let Simon in. 

“Amanda called you?” 

“Miss Everheart called, yes.” 
“All right. Miss Everheart. When 
you’ve interacted with as many por- 
nobooth movies of her as I have, 
you really feel like you know her. 

“I’m aware of that erroneous be- 
lief. Every other poor slob who’s 
ever interacted with one of her films 
feels the same way. But that doesn’t 
excuse your actions tonight.” 

“What did she tell you?” 

“That you are a reporter, 
threatening to disclose her whereab- 
outs. I must inform you it will do 
no good. I have acted under a pro- 
vision of Amanda’s contract and in- 
formed Richmond Dukker of your 
intentions.” He asked the bar for a 
drink. It produced one in silence. 
“I had no choice,” Brice muttered 
to himself. 

“Look, Brice, I’m going to tell 
you the truth because right now 1 
don’t care what happens to me. I’m 
in love with Amanda and — ” 

“I’m not surprised,” Brice said. 
“So am I. So is Richmond Dukker. 
So is every other man in the coun- 
try. So what?” 

“So if it wasn’t for that, Amanda 
would be dead now.” 



Brice’s head jerked up. “What 
are you talking about?” 

“I’m a brain assassin. I was 
hired to debrain Richmond Dukker ’s 
car. When I found out who the 
brain was, I couldn’t go through 
with it.” 

“You’re a — But who hired you? 
Who would want to kill Amanda?” 
“I think you know.” 

Brice looked down at the glass in 
his hand and then drained it in one 
gulp. “She made a lot of threats, 
but I never thought she would actu- 
ally go through with it. To tell you 
the truth, she made a lot of attempts 
before, but they never — and that 
accident — ” 

“Look, Brice, I need your help. I 
want to save her.” 

“It’s too late now.” 

“It can’t be.” 

“Under the terms of the contract, 
Richmond Dukker has the option to 
sell her to the Crackle Cola com- 
pany. He didn’t want the publicity 
and their operation is so large he 
was positive she would never be 
traced back to him. ” 

“So she gets what she wants.” 
Brice rubbed his shiny bald head. 
“She’ll be braining an apartment 
for one of the executives, I im- 
agine.” 

“You poor slob, don’t you re- 
alize she’s trying to kill herself. She 
wants to be a Crackle Cola dis- 
penser. She'll last six to eight 
months at the most.” 

“They can’t do that. It was a 
good contract. One of my best. She 
still has all her legal rights and un- 
limited credit. She’s a very wealthy 
woman and — ” 

“She’s a kook. She wants to be a 
Crackle Cola dispenser.”

Brice went pale. “Then she’ll do 
it,” he whispered. “She’s always 
done just exactly what she 
wanted.” 

“Call Dukker,” Simon told him. 
“Try to stop it.” 

Dukker’s line was busy. Simon 
took the phone from Brice’s trem- 
bling fingers and called Kane in- 
stead. “Have you heard from your 
party yet?” 

“Where the hell have you 
been?” Kane exploded. 

“Working on the contract.” 

' “That’s not what my party said. 
She wants a new man.” 

“I’ve got till midnight, re- 
member.” 

“That was the original agree- 
ment.” 

“You greedy bastard!” 

“Can’t help it, Simon. It’s a big 
contract. She raised the price. It’s a 
team job now. Carson and Mueller 
took it. ” 

“How long ago did you send 
them? ’ ’ 

“Half an hour or so. I couldn’t 
get hold of anybody right away. But 
listen, you stay away. You’re out of 
it now. ” 

“That’s what you think.” Simon 
slammed the phone down so hard 
the casing cracked. 

“What did that man mean?” 
Brice asked, his voice trembling. 
“Someone else is going to try to 
kill her?” 

“He’s sent a team in. Carson and 
Mueller. They’re good but they’re 
cautious. I might have time to reach 
her before — ” 

“I’m going with you,” Brice told 
him. 

* * * 



A Crackle Cola truck was parked 
in front of Richmond Dukker’s 
mansion. Simon leapt out before the 
car parked, without waiting for 
Brice. The gates were open and no 
longer guarded. One of the mech- 
dogs lay just inside, its legs sheared 
off. The brain still begged feebly 
for help. Simon sidestepped it and 
ran down the drive. Carson’s car 
was parked in the drive. Just past it 
he could see Mueller and Carson 
fighting with two brawny men in 
Crackle Cola uniforms. Another 
mech-dog, its head blown off, lay 
in the open garage door. None of 
the brawlers had noticed him yet. 
He hesitated beside Carson’s car. 
Cheyney Brice plunged past him 
and into the garage. 

“They’re not doing so hot,” Car- 
son’s car told him. “Carson never 
listens to reason. Mueller and I both 
tried to tell him to go slow.” 

Brice came running back out of 
the garage, screaming like a mad- 
man. “They’ve done it! The ghouls 
have taken her brain!” He plowed 
into the middle of the fight and 
grabbed Carson from behind. Muel- 
ler whirled around and shot Brice in 
the head. 

One of the Crackle Cola men hit 
Mueller over the head with a 
wrench and he dropped. Both of the 
Crackle Cola men jumped on Car- 
son. 

“Where’s the brain?” Simon 
asked Carson’s car. 

“In the back seat,” the car said. 
“But Carson’s not going to get 
away this time.” 

“Let me have it and you can give 
Carson a hand. ” 

“Take it,” the car said and 
opened the rear door. “But I’m not

going to help that bastard. He never 
listens to me. ” 

Simon grabbed the brain case and 
ran. He could hear Carson yelling 
for the car to come and help him, 
but apparently it didn’t work, be- 
cause the car passed him as he ran 
up the drive and it was empty. Car- 
son really should have listened to it 
more. His own car was waiting at 
the gate and as he jumped in, he 
blessed all the times he had listened 
to Growing Up in Bombay without 
interrupting. After a quick look 
back to see if they were being fol- 
lowed, Simon left the escape route 
to the car and turned his attention to 
the brain case. It was relatively un- 
damaged. Mueller must have taken 
it out. He probably intended to re- 
s A\ it after he collected his fee from 
Kane. A Cauc brain was worth too 
much to simply destroy. 

Aside from her own wish for 
self-destruction, there was nothing 
wrong with Amanda. She could last 
for years with the proper care. As 
soon as he got her back to his 
apartment, he connected her sensors 
and told her so. 

She said nothing. 

“I know you can hear me, 
Amanda.” 

When she still didn’t answer, he 
thought she was sulking. Then he 
realized that the lead to her mechan- 
ical vocal cords was broken. 

Automatically he reached for the 
tools to repair it. Then he paused, his 
hand on the tool chest, thinking. 

He got up and went over to the 
bar. ‘T want a — ” 

“The usual,” the bar said. “Sure 
thing. You know, I remember 
when — ” 

Simon punched the override and 



the bar poured his drink in silence. 
He took the drink back to his chair. 
He snapped the tool chest shut, 
leaned bac^, relaxed, put his feet on 
the table beside the brain case, and 
sipped his drink. 

It wasn’t right, what he was 
about to do, but this was the golden 
moment, his once-in-a-lifetime 
chance, and he wasn’t going to let 
it slip through his fingers. And of 
all captive audiences imaginable, 
Amanda Everheart ... He’d be a 
fool to pass that up! The faint flush 
of guilt was already fading, and re- 
placing it was some stronger emo- 
tion that he could not as yet iden- 
tify. 

He glanced at the tool chest. 
Eventually he would want some 
feedback, would have to have it if 
only to assure himself that she, and 
he, were still sane. He would re- 
connect her vocal cords, but there 
were a few changes to be made 
first. For starters, he would hook up 
a sound sensor that would make it 
impossible for her to speak if he al- 
ready held the floor. And a timer, 
so he wouldn’t have to listen too 
long. He could see the wiring di- 
agrams in his mind’s eye. But there 
was plenty of time for that. Later. 
First there were a few things he had 
to get off his chest. 

“I — ” For a moment he faltered, 
waiting for the inevitable interrup- 
tion, the press of someone else’s 
life which always seemed so much 
stronger than his own. Then, when 
it didn’t come, his voice flowed on 
swift and deep like a river of sound 
suddenly undammed. “I was bom 
on the hottest night in August, 
2004 .” *

Varley vision 

Rarely has a collection of 
stories by a new talent left me as 
breathless with admiration as John 
Varley ’s The Persistence of Vision. 
It is his first, but it ranks with the 
best — Nine Hundred Grand- 
mothers, The Martian Chronicles, 
The Peculiar Exploits of Brigadier 
Ffellowes; I think it is easily the 
second best book of the year, the 
first being Dickson's The Far Call. 

In my review of Varley ’s first 
novel. The Ophiuchi Hotline, I said 



Paul Walker 



I thought it was safer for him to 
publish a merely good novel the 
first time out, leaving readers to ex- 
pect better next time. I was right. 
Had the novel appeared after this 
collection, it would have seemed a 
disappointment. As it is, the stage 
has- been properly set for what 
seems a promising career. Even if 
his next novel is no better than 
Ophiuchi, The Persistence of Vision 
will support his reputation for years. 

What will be the scope of its ap- 
peal? 

Nothing is more discouraging 
than to write a rave review only to 
have your friends tell you that they 
found the book unreadable. Such 
was my case with the Silmarillion. I 
predict a greater popularity for Var- 
ley among sf fans, but I can sense 
qualities in his work that may 
alienate some. His stories are not 
exciting, but gentle, even sweet in 
effect. His pace is leisurely; he is not

fast-reading. His science is knowl- 
edgeable, but he is an anti- 
technologist in spirit, putting more 
faith in sex than the machine. And 
he is curiously old-fashioned, if in a 
most pleasing way. For all their 
freshness and originality, their mod- 
em sensibility, they gave me the 
impression I was reading a collec- 
tion of stories from Astounding as it 
might have been edited by a John 
W. Campbell III, his hair long 
where his father’s had been short, 
smoking pot instead of tobacco, yet 
still his father’s son. 

As Algis Budrys points out in his 
excellent introduction, the whole 
history of science fiction is to be 
found in Varley’s work: alien 

worlds, technological wonders, ex- 
traterrestrial adventures; Varley has 
the gift to make a reader feel he or 
she is there. He has the gift to 
make the reader take his future as 
much for granted as his characters 
do. There is no self-consciousness 
about his wonders that is not shared 
by his characters. 

For all the machines and extrater- 
restrial wonders that furnish his fu- 
ture world, it is always very human 
beings who occupy the core of 
every story. Varley’s characters are 
not simply there to represent oppos- 
ing forces or to narrate the action, 
they are the story. The opposing 
forces are most often within them- 
selves; the conflict most often a 
struggle for identity' or fulfillment. 
But unlike the case in similar con- 
temporary sf stories, the future they 
live in is not there merely so that 
their creator could publish the story 
as sf; everything in their world is 
there because Varley shrewdly con- 
ceived it (as the best sf writers 



have always conceived their future 
worlds) as if no one had ever done 
it before. His characters, then, are 
logically products of their environ- 
ments, with problems indigenous to 
their environments, yet with the 
same basic problems that have 
haunted humanity since civilization 
began. 

Virtually all of Varley’s pro- 
tagonists suffer from alienation — a 
product of their civilization, which 
is an extrapolation of ours for better 
and for worse. They are alienated 
from society or from themselves, 
and it is Varley’s view that the only 
remedy is a mutually satisfying rela- 
tionship. A man cannot solve his 
problems in a vaccuum, he needs 
another, or others. He has to have 
something to live for that is greater 
than himself. It may be art, it may 
be society, it may be, as it so often 
is in these stories, a personal rela- 
tionship; but a man cannot function 
successfully alone and self-loving. 
He has to extend himself into the 
world somehow, to belong to some- 
thing that is an extension of him- 
self. Few are born with this ability. 
It has to be learned. For Varley, the 
best means of learning it is a 
healthy sexual-social relationship 
with the opposite sex. 

He is a Utopian feminist, with a 
highly romantic view of the pos- 
sibilities of sexual equality. His 
enemy is capitalist individualism, in 
which every man is set apart, the 
captain of his own private enter- 
prise, which is the glorification of 
himself socially, sexually, and 
economically. Such an individual is 
adverse to any sharing of his 
capital self. He regards women, like 
everything else, as acquisitions.

GALAXY 




This tradition has led to a hostile 
competition between the sexes, 
alienating one from another, and 
obscuring their personal identities as 
they strive to live-up to their sexual 
roles. 

The society of Varley’s “Eight 
,Worlds” stories (in which humanity 
has been driven from the Earth by 
the whale-like Invaders) is free of 
sexism. It has eliminated sexist ideals 
by eliminating sexual roles. Organ 
transplants have made it possible for 
men to become women, and women 
men, as easily and as often as they 
like. Marriage and parenthood as 
we know them have been abolished. 
In “Retrograde Summer,” a father 
wishing to retain his child, who ac- 
cording to law is to be raised by his 
mother, has him cloned, changes 
his own sex to female, and both go 
to live on another world where the 
child grows up ignorant of the fact 
that his “mother” is actually his 
father. 

As comical as it sounds, the ef- 
fect of the knowledge on the pro- 
tagonist is to abolish any sexist illu- 
sions he may have had. As is the 
case with many of Varley’s charac- 
ters, the truth sets them free — the 
truth being that there is little in our 
lives that is concrete, and the 
deeper we look into ourselves , the less 
we are likely to find. Reality lies 
outside, with others. 

Varley’s stories deal with es- 
cape, either from an oppressive so- 
cial situation or from personal illu- 
sions. 

In “The Phantom of Kansas,” an 
artist finds her male self, literally, 
and the two escape a society that 
would destroy one for the benefit of 
the other. 



In “Air Raid,” a planeload of 
contemporary Americans is saved 
from disaster by a moribund future 
society to populate the planets and 
preserve humanity. In the end, as 
the narrator describes the hardships 
they will face on the primitive alien 
worlds, he knows he would give 
anything to go with them. 

In “The Black Hole Passes,” 
two physically isolated protagonists 
communicate with one another by 
means of hologram images, with 
which they fall in love. Together 
they evolve an elaborate fantasy 
life. Disaster strikes. The woman 
rescues the man, and they return to 
her world to find the reality of their 
love. 

In “Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance,” a 
symbiote artist from the rings of 
Saturn comes to a world devoted to 
agenting the work of ring artists. He 
meets an earth-bound woman and 
teaches her something of the free- 
dom of the selfless life of the rings 
where existence is a contemplation 
of beauty. 

In “Overdrawn at the Memory 
Bank,” a man is trapped inside a 
computer where he is forced to live 
out his life as a series of illusions. 
He has a female technician helping 
him to stay sane, and he finds a 
higher sense of reality of himself 
and the world. 

By far the best story is the last. 
“The Persistence of Vision” pre- 
sents the classic situation of a man 
alienated from society and himself, 
both of which are in a state of de- 
cay. He wanders and finds himself 
in a colony of deaf and blind people 
who have set up a communal society. 
Step by step, he learns their

methods of communication, and one 
by one, he discards his former illu- 
sions of how people are supposed to 
relate to one another. It is a deeply 
moving story. 

But what does all this add up to? 

Despite the subtlety of his treat- 
ments, what Varley is essentially 
saying is that love conquers all. If 
only people were nicer, kinder, 
more understanding to one another; 
if only people were allowed to re- 
alize their better natures, etc. etc. 
At bottom, he is as sentimental 
about man and the natural world as 
Simak. His method of dealing with 
evil is not to deal with it at all. He 
seems to think evil is strictly a mat- 
ter of ideology. Change a man’s 
ideas and you change his nature. Do 
you? 

We should be so lucky. 

Still, these are lovely stories to 
read. If you can afford it, I would 
recommend you buy the book. It 
may be a collectors’ item one day. 
In any case, don’t miss it. 



Cutups 



I enjoyed Hank Searls’ Jaws 2 
and Robin Cook’s Coma very 
much. I thought it would be nice to 
mention them, but when I tried re- 
viewing them, I found myself be- 
coming so critical that I began to 
wonder why I had ever liked them 
in the first place. 

In the first place, I did not read 
them critically. I read through them 
as quickly as possible, for story 
alone, as I might watch an old 
movie on TV. And in this way I en- 
joyed them. But looking at them 



critically, they raise questions in my 
mind. 

For instance, is there such a thing 
as "escape” literature? I expect the 
majority of you to say, yes, of 
course; but no other label, not even 
“sci-fi,” makes me bristle faster 
than that one. It was applied to my 
taste in literature from adolescence, 
and I have never ceased to resent 
or to deny it, at least, as it is 
applied to science fiction. 

Now, however, I will accept one 
definition of it; anything may qual- 
ify as an "escape” if it is experi- 
enced uncritically, if the experience 
is immediate and transitory, and has 
no more significant content than an 
ice cream cone, forgotten as quickly 
as it is consumed. 

I never forget a book that quick- 
ly, but it is safe to say I will not 
remember either Jaws 2 or Coma for 
long. Still, I do not regret reading 
them. I read them for pleasure; I 
was pleased. I would recommend 
them to anyone, and not be at all 
surprised if they hated them. I feel a 
mixture of contempt and admiration 
for them that puzzles me. The con- 
tempt I believe would be that shared 
instinctively by most science fiction 
fans toward mainstream imitations 
of their genre; and yet I feel admira- 
tion for the intelligence and skill 
behind them — something I am sure 
most science fiction fans, and writ- 
ers, overlook. 

Coma, as you probably know, is 
about a hospital that specializes in 
involuntary organ grants. The ads 
and reviews will tell you as much. 
It is the story of a -young medical 
student, who, on her first day at the 
hospital, sees a patient of her own 
age in a coma that will probably 



138 



GALAXY 




last the rest of her life. She asks 
how it could have happened. She is 
told it happens. Once in a hundred 
thousand cases. But she discovers 
this has happened more than six 
times in the hospital in the last three 
years. She decides to find out why, 
hoping to discover a new disease 
that will make her famous. 

For more than half its length, and 
at its best, Coma is a medical detec- 
tive story, with a completely believ- 
able, tenacious, and fiendishly in- 
genious heroine outwitting the sys- 
tem to get at the truth, the nature of 
which she never suspects until she 
sees it with her own eyes. She is a 
fine character, every inch the 
woman Cook says she is: her 

reasoning, with one blatant excep- 
tion, has the feel of real in- 
telligence, which is something you 
rarely find in fictional characters 
said to be intelligent. One reason is 
that she thinks her way to a solution to 
one problem that poses two more 
problems to be solved, as opposed 
to the typical sf intellectual who 
jumps from one conclusion to 
another — each invariably right — 
with a minimum of thought in be- 
tween. 

Her initial plight, a woman in a 
man's world, a sensitive and excep- 
tional individual trying to function 
successfully as a woman and a 
physician, is handled remarkably 
well, with compassion rather than 
fists. Cook does not make his 
heroine noble by contrasting her 
with male bigots, but suggests the 
complexity of feelings on both 
sides. 

The hero shares her complexity, 
but is a less sympathetic character. 
He is seen rather callously playing 



the game of hospital politics with 
people’s lives, worrying about their 
well-being only to the extent that it 
affects his career. Yet, in context, 
as the heroine realizes, he is think- 
ing like everyone else in the hospi- 
tal. Cook is neither self-rightous, 
nor indifferent, about the failures of 
hospital care. He is at his best in 
depicting these things in human 
terms. Things are the way they are 
because people are the way they 
are. 

By far, the best character in the 
novel is the hospital itself, Boston 
Memorial — an eerie old place that 
Cook paints so vividly you can 
smell it. Likewise, the medical pro- 
cedures are done as if you were 
watching them on film; but Cook 
never loses the human touch, as he 
watches everything through the eyes 
of a physican or a patient. 

His descriptive skill is evident in 
some of the individual scenes, espe- 
cially the chase through the 
anatomy lab which ends in a freezer 
filled with cadavers. The movie re- 
tained this scene, but I doubt it 
could compare with Cook’s 
ghoulish treatment of it. 

The book’s worst fault is its plot. 
Aside from the cliches, it is just 
too far-fetched. While, by the end of 
the book, I was convinced the 
heroine was capable of any thing, 
the moment she confronts the hired 
killer sent to silence her, her plausi- 
bility all but collapsed. I remained 
unconvinced by everything she did 
subsequently, as well as by the ex- 
istence of the Jefferson Institute, 
Cook’s chamber of horrors. The 
whole master scheme suddenly 
seemed simple-minded and con- 
spicuous. 



BOOKSHELF 



139 




Worst of all was the failure of the 
heroine to spot the prime villain — 
who was obvious to me, as to any- 
one else, from the start; but then, 
the whole plot seemed obvious from 
the start. Such a failing is not al- 
ways, or necessarily, disastrous. 
The emphasis in Coma is on the 
how, rather than the why, of the 
murders: how does the heroine learn 
the truth; how do they kill the pa- 
tients in clear view of everyone; 
how do they dispose of the bodies, 
which are not yet dead. Knowing 
the solution to the mystery actually 
enhances it. Coma leaves you won- 
dering, if not convinced, if this 
sort of thing is taking place some- 
where. 

Why, then, did I feel contempt 
for it? Was it merely prejudice 
against a mainstream intruder in sf 
territory? The sort that produced so 
many scathing reviews of Michael 
Crichton’s The Andromeda Strain? 

To some extent, yes. It is always 
annoying to see well-worn sf mate- 
rial given the best-seller treatment 
as if it were a bold, new concept; to 
know that the majority of people 
reading this, and shivering with 
pleasure, are ignorant of what it 
owes to science fiction, a field they 
otherwise disdain to read. 

That is a superficial reason. The 
main thing is the recognition as 
one reads of the number of stock 
characters and situations used for 
cheap effects. The big city hospital, 
of which we are given an insider’s 
view; the fresh-from-the-headlines 
theme; the beautiful- young medical 
student and the handsome intern; 
the hired killer from Chicago; the 
last-minute rescue in the operating 
room. So familiar are these ele- 



ments, so devoid of imagination, 
that experienced genre readers can- 
not help but feel they are reading a 
prefabricated fiction designed by ad 
men. And would they be so wrong? 

Yet — how much better is science 
fiction? Our plot structures are as 
formularized as Cook’s, based on 
techniques thirty and forty years 
old. Our ability to adapt these 
primitive structures to modem fic- 
tional requirements, with full char- 
acterizations and contemporary 
themes, has not been very success- 
ful. On the average, sf characters 
are as two-dimensional as ever, our 
themes no more contemporary, or 
original, than Cook’s, and, to be 
fair, considerably inferior. Cook’s 
people, his background, his basic 
idea of the exploitation of organ 
transplant knowledge is far more 
sophisticated than all but what our 
best science fiction writers could 
do. 

The same is true of Cook’s sci- 
ence. Sf writers long ago gave up 
educating their readers. There is 
more science behind the average sf 
story than in it. Once the writer has 
worked out the scientific problems 
behind his or her story, he spends 
only a minimal amount of space on 
details. Cook gives us pages and 
pages of technical detail on the op- 
eration of his hospital, operating- 
room procedure, and anesthetology, 
among other things. 

An sf writer would find this con- 
temptible, on principle, but the way 
Cook handles it, it is fascinating. 
There is far more real feeling for 
science and for scientific reasoning 
in Coma than in most of the sf 
books I read. Science fiction writers 
are more interested in the romance 



140 



GALAXY 




of future worlds, alien cultures, and 
the like, than in the romance of sci- 
ence. 

And then. Coma is a problem 
novel. The wily engineer (read: 
medical student) solving a mystery 
that threatens the earth. Most sf 
writers regard this type of story as 
dated. And it is, for them. But not 
for readers. 

Would sf writers profit from fol- 
lowing the example of a novel like 
Coma? 

1 would say yes, only to the extent 
that it returned them to an apprecia- 
tion of their commercial, rather than 
literary, origins. 

But how commercial is science 
fiction? 

The first thing that always occurs 
to me when I finish a book like 
Coma is: why didn’t someone like 
Larry Niven or Fred Pohl do some- 
thing like this years ago? God 
knows, Cook probably made more 
on his book than they did on a 
half-dozen of theirs. Yet 1 know in- 
stinctively that they would be con- 
stitutionally repelled by the idea. 

Science fiction writers know they 
could make more money writing 
something else, if only non-fiction. 
They have the technical ability, and 
they will tell you unhesitatingly that 
they write for money, and yet they 
continue to write science fiction. 
Even when they strive for the best- 
seller list, as with a Lucifer’ s Ham- 
mer, they are incapable of forcing 
themselves completely into the 
mold and limit their mass appeal by 
the weight of their ideas. 

What sets them apart from writers 
like Cook, who is primarily in- 
terested in writing a book that will 
sell, is that they wan! to write sci-

ence fiction. They want to be sci- 
ence fiction writers. Science fiction, 
for them, is as much a part of their 
identity as it is material for a book. 
The world of science fiction, its lit- 
erature and its people, are where 
and to whom they belong. Writing 
for them is not simply a living, but 
living itself. 

Their ideas, then, however bor- 
rowed and blue they may be, are 
more personal than those of a writer 
like Cook. I am more respectful of 
them. I believe in their creators’ 
seriousness; not only their ideas, 
but their artistic intent, however 
primitive it may be by comparison 
with better writers. I believe, re- 
gardless of its commercialism, sci- 
ence fiction has a serious in- 
tellectual and artistic intent that sets 
it apart, and somewhat above, its 
sister genres. Unlike the mystery or 
the western, which are purer forms, 
the science fiction story opens out 
into the world of ideas. One cannot 
read it as one can read other genre 
forms, without having to think be- 
yond the form itself. 

Therefore, I bristle at the idea of 
science fiction as “escape” litera- 
ture. 

But Coma does provide one 
example I wish more hard sf writers 
would emulate, and that is to take 
one idea and develop it fully, rather 
than their usual practice of using a 
speculative shotgun. The drama in- 
herent in the individual has been lost in 
the genre’s preoccupation with fu- 
ture worlds. 

Most of what I have said about 
Coma applies to Hank Searls’ Jaws 
2. It is a prefab job, but good sus- 
pense all the same, much better 
than the original. What I especially 



liked about it was the hero — a hero 
in every sense of the term, yet an 
anti-hero in spite of himself: a man 
who does nothing right. I think it 
was a mistake not to allow him to 
defeat the shark single-handed, b'v* 
the ending was consistent with his 
character. 

The central characters are appeal- 
ing; the background is nicely de- 
scribed; the shark is suitably 
menacing, if implausibly ubiqui- 
tous. The screenwriters, whose 
treatment Searls developed, have 
used the kitchen-sink approach to 
heighten the drama, which is ac- 
ceptable except for the godfather fig- 
ure who almost spoils everything. 

If you like suspense novels, you 
ought to like these two. I did. 

Horrors! 

A genre story is, by definition, 
an imitation, always of a superior 
model, but the word “genre,” to 
me, also connotes genuineness, a 
story of a particular kind with its 
own unique flavor, with which its 
fans are familiar to the point where 
they can detect the subtlest defects 
in its ingredients. 

The problem for the writer learn- 
ing a genre, if I may switch 
metaphors, is akin to learning a 
foreign language. Memorization of 
words and forms is insufficent; the 
less-than-thorough scholar will 
forever speak haltingly in a thick 
accent. He must learn the language 
to the point where he can think in it 
spontaneously, the point where he 
can share his thoughts and feelings 
naturally. Only then is originality of 
expression possible. 

The same is true of learning a 
form like science fiction or the hor- 



142 



GALAXY 




ror story. They, too, have a vo- 
cabulary of their own, terms, con- 
cepts, images, story structures; and 
if the writer settles for merely 
memorizing them, if he is incapable 
of that final step to internalization, 
his stories will forever read mechan- 
ically. 

Even so, like the foreigner who 
knows enough to get by, he may 
write successful stories. Such is the 
case with Stephen King. 

I liked his novels, and 1 enjoyed 
his latest book, Night Shift, a col- 
lection of short stories, most of 
them published in Cavalier from 
1970 to 1975, with a number of 
others from Penthouse bringing us 
up to 1977. Two are serious stories, 
two are sf, and the rest are either 
horror or suspense. There is little in 
them to interest the purist, but King 
is a skillful craftsman: he knows 
how to build suspense; and to the 
more open-minded, these stories 
will provide pleasure and excite- 
ment. 

There is an excellent introduction 
by John D. MacDonald on what 
makes a writer, and an interesting, 
if less successful, foreword by the 
author expounding his theory of 
horror stories. The essays make it 
plain that King is a writer of slick 
commercial fiction, but no hack: He 
is earnest about his love for horror 
stories, yet he is not a genre 
writer. 

The mechanical elements are 
there in every story: the well- 
rounded characters, the realistic 
backgrounds, the simplistic thematic 
treatments, like a collection of exer- 
cises from the Famous Writers 
School. I am tempted to quote one 
of the more mechanical paragraphs. 



but that would be unfair. King is 
very good at this. His prose is con- 
cise and visual. His characters are 
effective, and his plots are, as 
MacDonald insists, not as easy as 
they look. He makes every word 
count, but not in the constrained 
Hemingway manner that make’s so 
much genre prose self-conscious. 
From word one, he is building in an 
unhurried but deliberate manner to- 
ward his climax; and it is this 
technique of “building the narra- 
tive” that is his greatest strength 
and most obvious weakness. 

Although his characters walk into 
their adventures as haplessly as any 
genre protagonists, the source of his 
effectiveness lies in the relationships 
of the characters to the locales. In 
“Graveyard Shift,” it is a mill; in 
“The Mangier,” a laundry; in 
“Trucks,” a truck stop. Perfectly 
normal locales into which King in- 
troduces relatively normal people 
who encounter bizarre situations. 
But then what is more ominous 
than the drab? What is more preg- 
nant with possibilities for horror 
than the normal, the everyday, the 
ho-hum? Consider, for instance, 
David Berkowitz. 

King builds the relationship be- 
tween his characters and their 
locales in such a way that the 
bizarre, when it happens, seems 
merely bizarre and not preposterous. 
Take, for example, “The Lawn- 
mower Man,” not one of the better 
stories, in which a perfectly inno- 
cent suburban man calls a company 
to send someone to cut his lawn, 
and ends with having his throat cut. 
Such is the ordinariness of the sub- 
urbia King introduces us to that vir- 
tually anything is possible, if not 

143 



BOOKSHELF 




inevitable, and yet what makes it 
dramatic is that King exploits our 
private terror of strangers coming 
into our homes. Haven’t you ever 
been scared by a huge surly 
plumber barging into your place 
with a fat bag of tools with which 
he proceeds to turn your placid 
apartment into a steel mill? 

Unfortunately, the absence of any 
original theme or vision, as in 
Lovecraft or Bierce, makes these 
stories seem mechanical even while 
you are reading them. Entertainment 
alone is what they offer. 

Fortunately, they are entertaining. 
Virtually every story has one high 
point. 

My favorite is “The Ledge,” a 
Hitchcock-type story in which a 
man who has fallen in love with the 
unhappy wife of a mobster is 
offered a terrifying proposition that 
he has little chance of surviving. 
The ending has a delicious irony. 

“Jerusalem’s Lot” apparently 
appears here for the first time. It 
seems to be a precursor to a novel. 
It is old-fashioned and a blatant im- 
itation of Lovecraft, but I liked it 
anyway. “One for the Road” is a 
sequel to the novel in which a 
tourist gets trapped in the bumed- 
out town and a group of locals at- 
tempts to rescue him and his family. 

“Sometimes They Come Back” 
is about the closest King ever gets 
to an original idea, and he blows it 
at the end, but its portrait of a 
schoolteacher besieged by vicious 
young thugs he is trying to teach 
literature is nicely done. 

In “Battleground,” an assassin’s 
victim gains revenge by sending 
him a box of toys that play real war 
games. The analogy with the U.S. in 



Vietnam that might have made this 
story memorable is never realized, 
but the ending is hilarious. 

‘‘The Mangier” and “Trucks” 
concern machines coming to life to 
kill in gruesome ways. Both have 
chilling climaxes. King tops himself 
with his description of a* homicidal 
pressing machine. 

The remainder of the stories run 
from fair to good. There were none 
I disliked. If you enjoyed the 
novels, you should enjoy these. 
None is quite as good as Salem's 
Lot , but a few come close.

I’m sure. Alter, that all those 
readers who suffer from this minor 
(sometimes major) affliction will be 
happy to have this explanation of 
their problem. Now let’s get to 
some meat and potatoes. I have 
here a letter from David Carter, and 
he has some hard questions. I

GALAXY 




IN SCIENCE FICTION. There are 
a lot of cliche characters and situa- 
tions in SF. One is the aliens that 
invade Earth. Another is the dumb 
heroine who exists only to be res- 
cued or to give the hero or villain 
someone to talk to. Probably the 
worst is the “1953 syndrome ” where 
everything is just like middle 
America in 1953 except we have 
space travel or some other gadget 
or gimmick. ’ 

‘‘There’s a difference sometimes 
between cliches and simply lazy 
writing. The revolutionary technol- 
ogy overlaid on unchanged 
present-day society and culture is 
either don’t-give-a-damn writing by 
a pro who knows better but also 
knows he can get away with slop, 
or it’s the work of some beginner or 
bonehead who doesn’t know any bet- 
ter. Writing good science fiction 
takes applied intelligence! It’s 
goddamned hard mind work. The 
tragedy is that there are thousands 
of would-be writers out there without 
the intelligence, the self-discipline, 
or both. 

‘‘And let’s be honest; there are 
sloppy and don't - give - a - damn 
editors who arc willing tQ let this 
kind of slop be published because 
they don’t want to work with ‘al- 
most’ writers and/or because they 
don’t think the newsstand or 
bookstore buyers know good sf 
from bad anyway. Some of them 
reason. ‘Put a good colorful sf 
cover on anything and it’ll sell 
enough to make a fair profit. ’ 

“But beyond that — it’s virtually 
impossible now to create any char- 
acter who can’t be put into one or 
another cubbyhole as a cliche or 
stereotype. The thing to do is to ig-

nore the “problem” of stereotypes 
and cliches. Just make your char- 
acters and situations distinctive and 
individual by means of a little in- 
vention and real-life detail. The 
heart and soul of credible sf and 
fantasy is realistic future detail. [He 
noticed a six-inch zigzag crack in 
his crucible, but decided to go 
ahead with making the invisibility 
potion anyway.] 

'STOCK PROPS LIKE BLAST- 
ERS, HYPERDRIVE, GALACTIC 
EMPIRES. SF does have a lof of 
things that fans take for granted. 
Some of these we don’t think about 
but should. Science fiction gadgets 
often are clever enough to make up 
for poor characters, dumb plots, 
etc.’ 

“Altogether true. And if you ever 
have to make a choice, go for the 
clever gadgets, the weird sci- 
ence. .the (ghod help us) 
thousand-mile-long alien spaceship. 
Because that’s the guts of science 
fiction — the different, the won- 
drous, the captivating . Real people 
amid the artifacts is a bonus. Try to 
give your readers that bonus, of 
course. But don’t try to make char- 
acter the focus of your sf novel. 
Only a very very few writers — Le 
Guin, Wilhelm, D.G. Comptor, a 
few others — can do it. Most writ- 
ers end up writing too much “char- 
acterization” anyway, clumsily, 
hamhandedly. Ideally all character 
and personality shoud be incorpo- 
rated in action and dialogue and all 
action and dialogue should further the 
story. That’s where skill, art and 
discipline shows. ” 

'DEFENDING SF TO NON- 
FANS. How do you explain SF to 



teachers and friends who don’t read 
it? Most still think of it in terms of 
Buck Rogers or STAR WARS. A lot 
of their opinions are bigoted and 
ignorant.’ ' 

“Hell, most opinions on any sub- 
ject are bigoted and ignorant. Tell 
them nicely they don’t know what 
the hell they’re talking about, and 
mention that George Lucas, a sci- 
ence fiction fan, is going to make a 
billion dollars on STAR WARS be- 
fore he’s through. Tell them Joe 
Haldeman got a $100,000. advance 
for a novel recently, and that sf au- 
thors are sometimes selling movie 
rights to their books for a quarter of 
a million dollars. Then offer to an- 
swer questions about sf. You might 
also laugh in their faces. Why should 
the opinions of the ignorant and ob- 
tuse and stupid worry you?” 

‘CREATING FEMALE CHARAC- 
TERS . I hear a lot of people com- 
plain that female characters . .in 
sf. .are dumb and exist only to 
talk to the hero or villain and to be 
menaced and rescued. On the other 
hand I heard Princess Leia of STAR 
WARS described as " snippy ” be- 
cause she talked back to Han Solo 
and didn't thank Luke Sky walker for 
rescuing her. Any ideas on creating 
heroines with guts, brains and 
femininity?’ 

“There’s a cultural lag of about 
thirty years, I think, in what is 
called “popular opinion” on any 
given subject. The sf writing con- 
ventions and formulas and cliches 
and stereotypes of the 30s and 40s are 
still buried in massmind and at the 
push of the “sf” button reflexively 
surface today, still. It comes from 
the minds of fifty-year-old city 
editors, fifty-year old TV network

and local program directors. 

“Heroines with guts, brains and 
femininity? Structure your story so 
that the heroine must show those 
qualities! Make her important to the 
resolution of the story. Jesus, do I 
have to tell you the obvious?” 
CREATING A LOGICAL 
BACKGROUND. / think that the 
key to good SF is a logical, coher- 
ent background. I find it hard to 
accept stories where they have 
space ships and fusion power 
alongside feudal nobles and 
swordfights . One of the good things 
of reading SF is visiting other 
worlds and societies. Far too many 
SF writers make it up as it comes 
out of the typewriter and it shows.’ 
“A favorite way to write THE 
THREE MUSKETEERS under the 
sf label is to tell the reader that long 
after a decline into barbarism, a few 
ancient powerplants, designed for 
thousand-year automatic life, are 
still going. .and that the feudal 
planet has backslid after the col- 
lapse of the galactic empire. 

“The ancient, automated, un- 
breakable machine is a great con- 
venience to sf authors. Its use will 
die hard. In fact, hasn’t Fred Pohl 
just won a Nebula f6r Gate- 
way, which is premised on inde- 
structible alien spaceships? But he 
made them logical and detailed and 
coherent. They stole the novel from 
the neurotic hero who spent half the 
novel being psychoanalyzed by a 
Freudian computer. ’ ’ 

‘ BUILDING WORLDS. Most of its 
have enjoyed the marvelous alien 
worlds of Jerry Pournelle and Foul 
Anderson. Both men have written 
articles on how they do it. We also 
have enjoyed the fantastic aliens of 



Hal Clement and Larry Niven. They 
also have written about how they do 
it. I would like to know a lot more. 
Not long ago Pournelle and Niven 
wrote an article called “ Building 
the Mote in God's Eye." On page 
99 of the Jan. 76 Galaxy they said, 
“ Most hard science fiction writers 
follow standard rules for building 
worlds. We have formulae and tables 
for getting the orbits right, selecting 
suns of the proper brightness, de- 
termining temperatures and cli- 
mates, building a plausible ecol- 
ogy." I would like to get my hands 
on that data, and so would others. 
Think Alter could mug Pournelle 
and get it?' 

“I’m sure that Jerry and Larry 
are considering publishing their data 
and etc. if they think it worthwhile. 
On the other hand, a hard-science 
fiction writer will be already in- 
terested in that sort of thing and 
will know where to find that infor- 
mation in books . .will probably 
have a small private science library 
of his own. 

“I sniff a desire on your part to 
have somebody else do a lot of the 
work for you, David. If you are not 
all that interested in science — in hard 
science fiction — there are a host of 
other less scientifically rigorous var- 
ieties of sf that can be written.” 
‘Very good. Alter. Care to com- 
ment on another letter?’ 

“No! I’ve had it for this time. 
Let me get back to my sex scene.” 
Okay, go along with you. Write. 
“Yes . .let’s see now . ‘Her 
turgid tentacles trailed tenderly over 
his . .’ ‘She slipped a stiffened 
tendril . .’ ‘The alien woman’s 
plump pseudopod. Damn 
you, Geis! I’m out of the mood!” ★

Dear Mr. Pierce: 

A wise man once told me that a 
writer should never respond to book re- 
viewers. Some reviewers, he said, will 
then attack you personally, hoping to 
evoke further response, or (worse) will 
give you undeserved praise, fishing for 
a mash note. 

Good advice, and I’ve managed to 
follow it pretty well. In fact, I could 
still keep my silence in the face of your 
Mr. Walker's ill-informed and snide re- 
view of Study War No More in your 
May -number. But in the same column 
he says vile things about two men who 
are friends of mine, who are better 
writers than I am — and better than 
Walker will ever be, by the evidence at 
hand — and who, I suspect, are more 
vulnerable to Walker’s brand of genteel 
slander than I am. 

I didn’t notice that Walker had re- 
viewed Study War No More , though 1 
do subscribe to Galaxy. His previous 
reviews have been so asinine that I’ve 
stopped reading that part of the 
magazine — even though I have three 
books currently making the rounds of 
the review columns. 

Harlan Ellison sent me a copy. 

Walker’s problem seems, to me, to 



be that he does people reviews, not 
book reviews. This basic confusion 
comes out in hjs very first paragraph, as 
he loftily characterizes Gordon R. 
Dickson as "a writer for whom 1 had 
previously had no respect for [sic] 
whatever.” He goes on to give The Fur 
Call well-deserved praise. But I do 
have to wonder which of Dickson’s 
works he had previously read, to treat 
him with such (albeit ungrammatical) 
contempt. “Call Him Lord"? Soldier. 
Ask Not? “Black Charlie”? Anything? 

About Ellison’s story. Do me a favor, 
Mr. Pierce: read it. Then read Walker’s 
review. With the title deleted, could 
you identify the work reviewed as 
"Basilisk”? 1 couldn’t, and I’ve read 
the story many times. It seems to me 
that what’s under review is Paul 
Walker’s rather twisted perception of 
what goes on in Harlan Ellison’s mind. 
That’s not his job. Even if it were his 
job, he botches it. 

I’ve known Ellison for fifteen years, 
and I think I’ve been his friend for at 
least half that period. I know him mod- 
erately well — well enough to know that 
he is neither racist, nor cruel, nor shal- 
low, nor dishonest. Walker accuses 
him of all of these traits, though he 
cavils in context, and declines to pre- 
sent any concrete examples from the 
story. What is going on here? It isn’t 
book reviewing. It’s slander. 

Having read the minds of Dickson 
and Ellison, he goes on to read my 
mind and “poor” (!) von Clausewitz’s, 
and then the collective mind of the 
North Vietnamese people. When a per- 
son has given ample evidence that he 
can’t even read a book, I don’t trust his 
ability to read minds. 

Books In Print, for instance, makes 
good reading. If he had checked it. 
Walker wouldn’t have called Study War 



150 



GALAXY 



No More "Joe Haideman’s first anthol- 
ogy adventure.’’ Cosmic Laughter is 
still in print, after five years, and well 
into royalties thank you. 

I don’t care for Walker’s emasculat- 
ing and trivializing my work by quoting 
it partially, and out of context. But 
that’s a reviewer’s privilege. I don’t 
care for his being surprised that I am 
capable of "excellent” writing. But 
that's also etc. 

One thing I did like was his one- 
paragraph summation of the war in Viet 
Nam. Entertaining. 

1 get my best and worst reviews from 
•lienee fiction fanzines — and that fact 
set me thinking, Mr. Pierce. Do you 
pay this guy for this claptrap? The fan- 
zines are full of writers who are capable 
of nongrammatical character assassina- 
tion in the context of inaccurate book 
reports. You could have them for free, 
and they wouldn’t even ask for their 
name on the masthead. 

Sincerely,

Science fiction is not written by 
machines, nor is it read in a vacuum. 
For writers and readers alike', it is a 
very human activity, and the science fic- 
tion critic must describe it in human 
terms. In my opinion, Ellison the man is 
far more influential, and more interest- 
ing, than Ellison the writer. If Mr. 
Haldeman had read my review with his 
own eyes, instead of Ellison’s, he would 
have seen that I accused Ellison of none 
of the crimes he alleges. 

As for Gordon Dickson, / was guilty 
of a slight exaggeration. Previous to 
The Far Call, / had little, rather than 
no, respect for him. The point / was try- 



ing to make, and which I think / made 
vividly, was that nothing / had read by 
him before prepared me for the quality 
of his performance in the novel. / have 
always thought of Dickson as a good 
writer who wrote badly, especially in 
his short stories. As I understand it, he 
never had to work harder at a book 
than he had to work on this one, and 
the effort proves what he was capable 
of writing all along, but did not. 

/4s for my “asinine" reviews, Mr. 
Haldeman is, of course, referring to my 
less-than-adulatory reviews of his own 
work.

Galaxy: 

— Just writing to say that your May 
‘78 issue was my first introduction to 
your magazine, and that I think you 
have a well-balanced fare. Benford’s 
Stars in Shroud is so far superb (I only 
wish Benford’s description of the 
Flinger was clearer). Fabian’s illustra- 
tions capture well the tone of the text, 
making this a great collaboration. 
You’ve got your hands on a winner 
here! Murphy’s "Eyes of the Wolf” 1 
thought was competent, but nothing ex- 
ceptional. The illustrations again helped 
the mood. “A Snatch in Time” by 
Moak was great fun. but I almost 
passed this one by on account of the il- 
lustrator. Amy Harlib captured none of 
the humor of this story in her illustra- 
tions, and I came to this one expecting 
something quite different than what I 
got. Sorry, Amy, but I’m sure Mr. 
Moak would agree that there’s too great 
a disparity between the pictures and the 
text. 

I’m afraid I was downright disil- 
lusioned by your Showcase illustration 
by Poyser. It showed a lack of good 
taste, and in the future I think you

should forward such stuff to Heavy 
Metal or something, but it seems to 
have no place in Galaxy. Neither does a 
stupid short like Schweitzer’s “Boy 
Meets Girl.” These were surrounded by 
some really excellent writing — don’t let 
them creep in. I’d rather see fewer 
pages than mere fillers. 

All in all, I can only say “Good 
job!” You know where the bugs are — 
get ’em out and keep up your high 
standards. We need to insist on the 
best.

Dear Mr. Pierce: 

After enjoying the first three stories 
in the April 1978 issue, 1 decided to 
pause and write to find out if you were 
pressed for space, and that’s the reason 
you didn’t include any notes on two of 
the stories. Where did the Cordwainer 
Smith story come from after all these 
years? Is it all in his words or not? 

And has the Larionova story been 
published before? I find it hard to be- 
lieve that a story called “The Defector” 
and containing an obvious analogy to 
the iron curtain and the puppets behind 
it could ever have been published in 
Russia! 

The third story “The Devil and All 
Her Works” was a novice writer’s at- 
tempt to use the subject of Fate with 
some emphasis on irony, I presume. 
Nice start and interesting.

"The Defector” was published in 
Russia, during a period of liberalization 
that ended shortly after the invasion of 



Czechoslovakia. / haven't heard of any- 
thing new from Larionova since then, 
and there have been disturbing reports 
of other sf writers being harassed by the

—j.j.p. 

Dear J. J.: 

This is in response to Jay Kay’s re- 
view of Close Encounters in your May 
issue. 

Samp general observations: 

(1) Star Wars had special effects 
that were functional: they were used to 
get characters from one place to another 
in the plot, and served admirably; I 
applaud them. But Close Encounters 
took on a much more difficult task: to 
create special effects that were simply 
beautiful and awe-inspiring. Their final 
effect, the Big Ship, succeeds as far as 
1 can see. It does not resemble a giant 
chandelier, but a luminous City in 
Flight. 1 love it. 

(2) The special effects in Close En- 
counters are not entirely glimpses of 
flashing lights. Many of those lights are 
shining from solid vehicles, which can 
be glimpsed wheeling and timing in del- 
icate motion as they speed along. As 
for “realism,” and failure to advance 
special effects past the level of 
Star Wars, Spielberg and Trumbull used 
new, untried techniques to create their 
light-machines and present them re- 
alistically against a background. And 
while the final bombing-run in Star 
Wars was thrilling, no devotee of SF 
films can really believe that the corridor 
on the Death Star’s surface was any- 
thing but a model constructed out of 
plastic-model parts. 

(3) As far as storytelling goes. Star 
Wars is a flop; Lucas has all the ob- 



152 



GALAXY 




ligalory scenes of the genre, but his plot 
has holes you could drive an Imperial 
Falcon through. (Why are single-pilot 
fighters considered no threat?) Close 
Encounters is a simple but very well- 
constructed story. The alien mind-plant 
is the “seed” from which Spielberg de- 
velops a logical and well-motivated 
conclusion. 

(4) Close Encounters is science fic- 
tion. Ft is the best film to treat the 
theme of “first contact” because it 
treats that contact as sought after for its 
own sake, rather than for some ulterior 
motive such as world conquest. 

Spielberg may have made an artistic 
mistake in deciding to use the UFO 
phenomenon as the basis of his plot, but 
the UFO rage is near the fore of the 
public’s mind, and the associated fasci- 
nation with alien contact makes it a log- 
ical starting point. 

Star Wars and Close Encounters are 
both excellent filmmaking, advances in 
the technical side of the art; both have 
much to offer in the genre of SF. But 
while Star Wars, in its magnificent de- 
tail, presents many of the trappings of 
sf. Close Encounters deals primarily 
with its thematic and intellectual basis. 
It deals more strictly with an SF “no- 
tion,” and left me with an intellectual 
satisfaction of seeing the SF dream of 
alien contact realized. I suppose that’s 
why I preferred Close Encounters . 

Jeff Rovin: right on, man, but, uh, 
don’t go overboard. Some aspects of 
Close Encounters demand critical evalu- 
ation, while Jeff is giving them outright 
praise. Those children in blue-alien suits 
should never have been included; but 
I’ll credit Spielberg with guts. Once 
he’s brought them on, he keeps the 
cameras close in on them, so we have 
to overcome our initial disbelieving 
laughter and accept them. (There’s 



more; why must that little red spaceship 
be transparent ? etc.) 

J.J.; Keep Fabian working for you, 
please! No more pencil sketches for il- 
los; and make the new artists you’re 
publishing produce work above the 
crudzine level! And please, absolutely 
no more titles inked-in by the illus- 
trator! Half the time, they’re all but il- 
legible! Maybe you can save Galaxy 
from being the ugliest prozine around!

•Dear Mr. Pierce, 

Jeff Rovin 's view of Close Encoun- 
ters of the Third Kind irked me. The 
promise of the theme — the first meeting 
of humans and ET’s — was not lived up 
to by Spielberg. Any reader of your 
magazine could have come up with a 
better plot. Existing science fiction al- 
ready contains innumerable tales of first 
encounters and their consequences — one 
particularly well-reasoned and entertain- 
ing was The Mote in God’s Eye by 
Larry Niven and your own Jerry Pour- 
nelle (by the way, Jerry, where’s the 
sequel?). Infinite possibilities for the 
silver screen. Instead, what do we get? 
Pretty lights chasing each other about in 
a mindless fashion, psychic phenomena, 
a protagonist whose obsession borders 
on insanity, a mindless governmental 
conspiracy, and a breathless pursuit by 
a bumbling army (towards the moun- 
tain). The finale shows the aliens (who 
where disappointingly humanoid) land in 
a blaze of glory. The hero, a dumb 
electrician, hops aboard their spacecraft 
(taking the place of an infinitely more 
qualified scientist) and zooms 
away. to heaven. The whole thing 
has too much of the “Second Coming”

aspect to it: greatly superior beings 
watching out for us, and who might, 
some day (if we become good 
enough?), take us away to “Heaven” or 
turn the Earth into paradise with their 
incredible powers. Feh. And this is the 
story that Mr. Rovin compared to 
Dante’s Divine Comedy? A closer com- 
parison would be the North Podunk Post 
Office next to the Taj Mahal. 

Poumelle’s column was the best in 
months, as was the artwork. 1 enjoyed 
Harlan’s editorial about walk the walk; 
try to get more guest editorials. Heinlein 
and Asimov are both highly opinionated 
on some subjects. So far, you are 
doing a fine job as editor — keep up the 
good work. And see if you can con- 
vince Jerry to publish a sequel to Mote 
in God's Eye (or even A Spaceship for 
the King ) as a serial in Galaxy.

CE3K is the sort of movie that’s 
wonderful to watch, hut starts to fall 
apart the minute you start to think 
about it. It has the right feel to it, de- 
spite the cliches, and maybe it will ac- 
tually do some good ( Everybody pre- 
dicted it would touch off a huge in- 
crease in UFO “sightings," but that 
hasn't happened.) if we’re really visited 
by aliens.

Dear Mr. Pierce: 

Gee whiz! Why doesn't Harlan 
thump his chest (breast? bosom?), rend 
his garments, rub ashes on ms luicnead, 
wail in a loud voice and gnash his teeth 
a bit before going forth to bring en- 
lightenment to the heathen? 

ETHICS are simple: Harlan has, as a 



professional writer/public speaker, bound 
himself legally, morally, and ethically 
to perform at Iguanacon as promised 
to the Iguanacon Committee. 

Must he emote so enormously before 
deciding personally to satisfy his profes- 
sional obligations? 

BUSINESS is also simple: The 

Iguanacon Committee should have re- 
quested a surety bond to guarantee 
either specific performance or reim- 
bursement for their loss. 

Certainly, future convention commit- 
tees should consider this option — not 
only from Mr. Ellison but from other 
“notables,” V. I. P.’S, and GoH’s in- 
vited to attract fans. 

Agreed, Mr. Ellison’s current cause 
(fanaticism?) may be a worthy one, but 
must he insist on making a self- 
righteous, public ass of himself about 
it? Must I (a reader — a consumer 
even!) be subjected to Mr. Ellison’s 
compulsion to make a self-righteous 
public ass of himself? The only “rock” 
or “very hard place ’’.here seems to be 
Mr. Ellison’s head!

most urgent problem and vitally impor-

Harlan will expect a barrage of flak, 
which he can stand while he’s in the 
barrel, as reactionary religious elements 
try to scare us away from walking the 
walk and into turning our heads and 
saying it is none of our affair. 

There’s just one thing I don’t get. 
Harlan says he doesn't want us to 
"permit the gap between what we say 
we are. and what we really are, to exist 
[Italics Harlan’s].” Harlan’s brave 
statement of firm resolve in the face of 
implacably reactionary (that’s one of 
Harlan’s favorite words) religious ele- 
ments and other anti-ERA fascist scum 
leaves me with one question: Who’s 
we? Also, what are "we” really? 

Now, I’ve read lots of Harlan — 
enough, certainly, to know that anyone 
who disagrees with him is ipso facto 
“reactionary.” So I won’t disagree with 
Harlan’s brave statement of firm re- 
solve, in which and by which he has 
risked his reputation and his life and his 
goldfish and just about everything to 
live in a tent outside Phoenix. But I 
would like to suggest that some sci-fi 
fans — fans who are literate enough to be 
uncomfortable with cliches, bromides, 
mindless jargon, and semi-literate 
politicizations — might have trouble, 
well, relating to Harlan's writing in a 
meanful way that’s relevant, know what 
I mean?

Well, we have to swallow Harlan, f 
guess. But I'll pass up the goldfish. 
How about the rest of you?

Dear Mr. Pierce: 

As a long-time science fiction en- 
thusiast, a would-be professional in the 



genre, and a native of Phoenix, 
Arizona; I feel it my duty (both SF and 
civic) to respond to Harlan Ellison’s 
rather intemperate outburst concerning 
the Iguanacon. the State of Arizona, 
and the fact that our legislature has yet 
to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. 
First, some facts: 

Arizona is a very conservative state (I 
think it’s something in the air) Whether 
you agree or disagree with the prevail- 
ing political climate here, you must rec- 
ognize it exists. Arizona has no 
medicaid fraud. Reason: No medicaid. 
Arizona’s welfare burden is at its lowest 
in fifteen years (in numbers of reci- 
pients). Reason: The low level of bene- 
fits compared to neighboring California. 
Arizona’s property tax rates are the 
envy of many more progressive states. 
(In spite of the fact that 75 percent of 
the state is federally owned and does 
not pay taxes.) Reason: The aforemen- 
tioned low weifare burden. 

Given this conservative political cli- 
mate, it is a bit silly to blame the defeat 
of the ERA strictly on the influence of 
an unnamed religious group (Mormons). 
The fact of the matter is that the people 
of Arizona are overwhelmingly opposed 
to the ERA. If you want an inkling of 
why, consider what the bureacracy that 
tried to ban father-son banquets would 
do if they had a real live constitutional 
amendment to play with. 

I found the tone of Mr. Ellison’s re- 
marks disturbing. Why is it that the 
supporters of ERA question the honesty, 
sincerity, patriotism, and morals of 
those who oppose it? Answer: they are 
losing and getting desperate. 

Mr. Ellison suggests an economic 
boycott of the state during the conven- 
tion. I live here, so I will not be par- 
ticipating. Furthermore, a more coun- 
terproductive move on his part is hard 



DIRECTIONS 



155 




to imagine. Science fiction fans are a 
negligible economic force anywhere. 
Such a boycott will only succeed in 
strengthening the opposition. All Arizo- 
nans (including recent arrivals from 
New York) see themselves as rugged 
individualists in the tradition of the 
Wild West and they tend to get surly 
and uncooperative when attacked. 

Finally, the thing that most disturbed 
me about the editorial was the streak of 
fanaticism that ran through it. I couldn't 
help thinking as I read it that Harlan El- 
lison, in another time and place, might 
have been just as happy shoving hapless 
Jews into furnaces to preserve the purity 
of the Aryan race as in boycotting 
Arizona to punish it for its failure to 
ratify the ERA. (This last is not in- 
tended as a low blow, but merely my 
honest reaction to the fanaticism and 
lack of tolerance running through the 
piece). You will note that in none of the 
above have I commented on my own 
position on ERA (although it might sur- 
prise you). 1 feel strongly, however, 
that there are good people, differing 
honestly, on both sides of the issue and 
that the situation does not need any rab- 
ble rousing. 

As for me, I will be attending the 
convention and hope to have a wonder- 
ful time. If Mr. Ellison would like to 
seek me out and punch me in the nose, 
he is free to ... uh. try.

This won’t appear until after the 
WorldCon, alas. If you didn't catch 
Harlan there, you can make the pil- 
grimage to Sherman Oaks and I'm sure 
he' II be glad to oblige you ....

Dear Sir: 

There is politics and, there is Politics. 
And I’m afraid Dick Geis wasn’t able to 
distinguish between the two when he 
criticized Harlan Ellison's actions in the 
June Galaxy. 

Geis implied in his column that sup- 
porting the ERA (politics type 1) is 
equivalent to supporting political par- 
ties, like the Democrats of the Ameri- 
can Nazis (Politics type 2j. Nothing 
could be further from the case. 

Certainly no WorldCon should start 
supporting a particular political party or 
political philosophy, whether liberalism, 
conservatism, socialism, or fascism. 
Like any large group of people, science 
fiction fans hold greatly divergent views 
on how to run the world, and no 
WorldCon should try to impose one 
view on them. 

But the ERA is not a political view in 
that sense. It is a moral issue, and one 
that science fiction fans should take a 
stand on. 

If there is any one theme running 
through science fiction, it is that 
xenophobia is irrational, that we are all 
comrades under the skin, and that pre- 
judice is immoral. How can SF fans not 
support an amendment that is trying to 
guarantee this basic tenet for all the 
people in the U.S., not just men? 

I support Harlan’s views completely 
and I wish him every success at the 
WorldCon. 

On the other hand, I completely agree 
with Geis’s column where he denounced 
lazy writers. It’s true — in the majority 
of cases, if the first paragraphs are in- 
teresting, the rest of the book will prob- 
ably also be interesting. Conversely, 
boring, depressing, ' overly descriptive, 
and uninteresting first paragraphs tend 
to lead to boring, depressing, overly de- 
scriptive and uninteresting books. It's 



156 



GALAXY 




quite a good guide. 

It’s simply a matter of respect for the 
reader. If a writer wants to be read and 
wants to have his or her ideas thought 
about, (s)he will write interestingly 
enough to make the reader want to read 
the writer's stories. And, since most 
readers will judge a story by its opening 
paragraphs (or chapters in a novel), a 
writer has a special obligation to make 
those particularly interesting.

P.S. I was relieved to see Geis and 
Alter back again in the June issue after 
their long absence. It just didn’t seem 
like Galaxy without Alter’s pseudopods 
slithering over the pages. 

You see, we did get some pro-Harlan 
letters — very few, to be sure, but we’re 
including one of them for the sake of 
fairness. 

— i-j-P- 

Dear Dr. Poumeile: 

I find your unconditional support of 
nuclear energy as the correct answer to 
the energy problem very disturbing, to 
say the least. I can’t help wondering if 
you haven’t heard of the recent con- 
troversy over the question of whether 
low levels of radiation are as harmless 
as they are commonly believed to be. 1 
take it upon myself to enlighten you; al- 
though the balance of this letter may be 
more political than scientific. 

There is a scientist named Dr. 
Thomas Mancusa who suddenly found 
himself at war with the U.S. govern- 
ment, who is now known as a dissident 
scientist, who is now the target of a 
campaign of suppression. 

In 1964, before any of this, the 



government commissioned the good doc- 
tor to measure how safe nuclear power 
plants are for the people who work in 
them. This was the first study of its 
kind and so it was invested with special 
significance. 

The initial findings were innocuous. 
But almost two years ago. Dr. Mancusa 
and two associates turned up alarming 
evidence that low levels of radiation, 
previously thought to be safe, can actu- 
ally be quite deadly. 

Zap! The government suddenly cut 
off the, funds, shoving Mancusa into 
premature retirement and attempting to 
take possession of his study. The 
numbers on Mancusa ’s charts and 
graphs show people who have died after 
being exposed to doses of radiation the 
government claims are safe. If the 
government were to pay compensation 
for these deaths, it would amount to 
millions, perhaps billions, of dollars. 

Mancusa is only one of several scien- 
tists in the same predicament; victim to 
adverse politics. Against the govern- 
ment’s will, he is unable to work for 
more solid proof of his finding. 

Hanford is a government facility on 
the eastern edge of Washington, known 
to its residents as “Plutonium City.” It 
was built during World War II for the 
production of atomic bombs; the coun- 
try’s first nuclear weapons center. It in- 
troduced people-made radiation into the 
ecosystem for the first time. 

The AEC saw cause for concern 
when it received a phone call from Dr 
Samuel Milham, a researcher in the 
Washington state health department. Dr. 
Milham had been independently sifting 
through the death certificates of 30,000 
Washington workers. 

He hadn't started out looking for ef- 
fects of radiation, but it turned out the 
Hanford people had too many cases of 



DIRECTIONS 



157 




cancer. 4,032 Hanford workers have 
died since World War II, 832 from 
cancer, 7% more than expected. 

These 832 had received about 25% 
more radiation than their non-cancer 
counterparts; yet still well within the 
government’s “safe” zone of 5 rems. 
In 10 years a worker could absorb up to 
50 rems. And these 832 people received 
an average of only 2 rems apiece during 
their entire time on the job. 

Dr. Milham wished to publish his 
discoveries in a medical journal, but the 
AEC expressed resistance to causing a 
controversy; Milham decided to wait 
and see what Mancusa came up with. 

The ERDA didn’t want Mancusa’s 
report released. They wouldn’t renew 
his grant for further research and hurt 
his chances of finding other grants. 
When he was fired, the reason given 
was, “Deficiencies in performance 
under the contract." There was no evi- 



dence of this and a month later this 
statement was withdrawn. 

Dr. Karl Morgan is a most respected 
man in the field of nuclear health; he is 
on Mancusa’s side. He wants the real 
answer discovered, be it one way or the 
other. 

Dr. Mancusa has been censored, 
taken to court, hounded, and harassed. 
Without the proper research, we may 
never know the real truth of low level 
radiation. Does Hanford apply to the 
other nuclear plants? Due to resistance, 
we may never know. 

Dr. Poumelle, how can you support a 
source we don’t know quite enough 
about? Despite your beliefs to the con- 
trary, 1 think solar power is the answer 
to the energy problem. Its only problem 
is the initial cost.

THINGS TO COME 

Starting next issue, GALAXY will have a new editor: Hank Stine. 

Stine achieved some notoriety about ten years ago with Season of the 
Witch, a controversial science fiction novel that has since become some- 
thing of a collector’s item, for collectors who can find it. It will soon be 
reissued in an illustrated edition. 

Since that time, Stine has worked largely in films and television. He 
has written and directed a number of educational films and “countless” 
TV commercials, directed TV documentaries and worked with Star Trek 
and The F.B.I. 

His writing credits range from a novelization of The Prisoner and ap- 
pearances in Amazing to work for the Los Angeles Free Press, Craw- 
daddy and Debonair (!). 

Already he has plans in mind for major changes in the policy, format 
and overall direction of GALAXY. You’ll be seeing these changes next 
month and in the months to come. Of course, you’ll still be seeing the 
last two installments of Jem and, perhaps, some stories that were al- 
ready purchased when Stine was hired; but he wants his stamp to show 
on the magazine from his first issue. 

Watch for the new GALAXY, and get in on the excitement!

you’ll receive your introductory package of four books 
for just IOC , plus shipping and handling. You may 
examine them in your home, and if not completely 
satisfied, return them within ten days — membership 
will be cancelled and you'll owe nothing. 

About every 4 weeks (14 limes a year), we’ll send 
you the Club's bulletin. Things to Come, describing 
the 2 coming Selections and a variety of Alternate 
choices. If you want both Selections, you need do 
nothing; they'll be shipped automatically. 

If you don’t want a Selection, nr prefer an 
Alternate, or no book at all, just fill out the convenient 
form always provided, and return it to us by the date

Alternates during the coming year. You may resign any 
time thereafter, or remain a member as long as you 
wish. At least one of the two Selections each month is 
only $1.98 plus shipping and handling. Other extra- 
value Selections arc slightly higher but always much 
less than Publishers' Editions. Send no money. Fold
